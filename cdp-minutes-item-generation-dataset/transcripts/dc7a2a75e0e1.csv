85,0.97,355.388,355.888,They're long overdue.,22,,
86,0.97,355.888,361.127,But still we have to address violence that occurs regularly in my neighborhood.,22,,
87,0.97,361.127,365.198,Much is related to an Opare drug market operating for years.,22,,
88,0.97,365.198,377.61,The violence that comes out of this area touches hundreds of residents that live within a block of the corner and thousand that's have catch the bus.,22,,
89,0.97,377.61,381.514,A man tried to shield me from a group wanting to beat them up.,22,,
90,0.97,381.514,387.72,They got me out of the way and pummeled them in front of bus riders.,22,,
91,0.97,387.72,389.288,Looking back I was fortunate.,22,,

107,0.97,446.946,447.313,Hi.,24,,
108,0.97,447.313,453.719,Actually I'm a person who has witnessed and been victimized by violence in the community.,24,,
109,0.97,453.719,464.797,I would urge the Council to Defund the police because I recent not being able to call them and knowing that they will safely resolve a situation.,24,,
110,0.97,464.797,475.641,We need community services rather than Criminalizing our homeless population that are often mentally ill and in dangerous situations and not violent.,24,,
111,0.97,475.641,477.276,Drug use doesn't equal violence.,24,,
112,0.97,477.276,477.977,It is an illness.,24,,
113,0.97,477.977,488.221,And we need to Defund the police at least 50% and reinvest in the community or else these situations will only get worse.,24,,
114,0.97,488.221,489.889,"Thank you, Jill.",25,,
115,0.97,489.889,491.924,The next person is Howard.,25,,

119,0.97,502.969,503.336,Welcome Howard.,25,,
120,0.97,503.336,518.484,"This is Howard Dale from district 7. rather than discussing Defunding and Reimagining our policing system this afternoon you will actually be discussing giving the OPA, office of police accountability more money.",26,,
121,0.97,518.484,525.625,The OPA has stood by over the last ten years when the SPD has killed 27 people without any accountability.,26,,
122,0.97,525.625,539.338,Your job is to Defund the existing failed structures of both the police and the accountability system and support and fund real community oversight.,26,,
123,0.97,539.338,551.384,Please in discussing any police public safety funding today explain to the public how giving more money to the very entity that's ignored recent murder of Perry by the SPD will increase accountability.,26,,
124,0.97,551.384,557.79,Do not give more money to entity that's serve continuing police practices.,26,,
125,0.97,557.79,558.09,Thank you.,26,,
126,0.97,558.09,562.495,"Thank you, Howard.",27,,
127,0.97,562.495,567.466,"Good morning, Carlee.",27,,
128,0.97,567.466,567.7,Hi.,28,,
129,0.97,567.7,571.304,May my name is Carlee gray.,28,,
130,0.97,571.304,576.609,I'm a resident of district 7 living in lower Queen Anne.,28,,
131,0.97,576.609,583.182,I'm calling in support of a solidarity budget that makes six Kia Mendments to the Mayor's budget.,28,,
132,0.97,583.182,594.794,First I support the demand that you have heard in the streets and in countless city council meetings over the last several months to divest from the Seattle police department by at least 50%.,28,,
133,0.97,594.794,598.864,Those funds should be distributed through a budgeting process.,28,,
134,0.97,598.864,606.605,I'm also asking that investments in black communities and Community-Led health and safety solutions.,28,,
135,0.97,606.605,612.545,Not by taking away money from funds like jump start Seattle revenue or other city funds.,28,,
136,0.97,612.545,622.655,"Jump start Seattle funds and other funds should remain allocated to intended purpose to preserve vital services, parks and Covid-19 relief.",28,,
137,0.97,622.655,631.063,I urge you Council members to reject Mayor Durkan's tactics against community health and safety.,28,,
138,0.97,631.063,636.836,Five months of protesting and organizing should make our message clear by now.,28,,
139,0.97,636.836,641.24,We need to protect black lives in Seattle.,28,,
140,0.97,641.24,642.041,Frank Francisco.,29,,
141,0.97,642.041,642.274,Frank.,29,,
142,0.97,642.274,643.876,We don't see you listed as present.,29,,
143,0.97,643.876,644.91,I'm going to keep going.,29,,
144,0.97,644.91,648.748,"If you call in, we will come back to you.",29,,
145,0.97,648.748,656.055,Quan Lee followed by Jim Street and Mac Mitchell.,29,,
146,0.97,656.055,656.722,Quan Juan.,29,,

155,0.97,688.521,688.754,Hi.,30,,
156,0.97,688.754,693.759,I'm live in district 5. I moved to Seattle in 2019 to start medical school.,30,,
157,0.97,693.759,703.135,One thing that has been clear during that time is that treating is less offensive and more expensive than preventing it in.,30,,
158,0.97,703.135,708.14,"The same way policing responds to crime, poverty and mental illness with punishment.",30,,
159,0.97,708.14,718.15,The budget should diverse from SPD by at least 50% to invest in black communities and Community-Led programs that actually build up health and safety.,30,,
160,0.97,718.15,727.059,"That also allows a jump start fund to be used to maintain public services, find affordable housing subpoena move towards the Seattle green new deal.",30,,
161,0.97,727.059,735.401,I'm asking city Council to support the solidarity budget because it works for dignity and justice for everyone.,30,,
162,0.97,735.401,735.701,Thank you.,30,,
163,0.97,735.701,736.168,Thank you.,31,,

245,0.97,1144.843,1147.179,Number two relocate under privileged community.,45,,
246,0.97,1147.179,1161.994,When I say police budget it means that these vital services should be coming out of the police budget.,45,,
247,0.97,1161.994,1162.961,As well.,45,,
248,0.97,1162.961,1174.339,So there are budgeting from some art and some vital services for the underprivileged communities.,45,,

262,0.97,1205.337,1208.64,I want to address needing protection from physical violence.,50,,
263,0.97,1208.64,1222.321,The police haven't been able to shut down a drug market for many many years and they weren't able to protect her or someone else in her community after that.,50,,
264,0.97,1222.321,1228.26,I may not be a police abolitionist but they have had a chance to do their jobs for so long.,50,,
265,0.97,1228.26,1231.463,Now it is time for the community to figure out how to be safe.,50,,
266,0.97,1231.463,1232.331,Thank you very much.,50,,

272,0.97,1241.974,1245.077,I'm the executive director of Seattle neighborhood green ways.,52,,
273,0.97,1245.077,1262.094,We just came through an unprecedented summer of climate fires and toxic smoke which leads me to wonder why we are considering a budget that would help us reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.,52,,
274,0.97,1262.094,1272.704,We really think that basic maintenance is include basic mobility of being able to walk safely and comfortably and take bikes and transit where you need to go.,52,,
275,0.97,1272.704,1277.109,We're concerned about suspending the minimum general fund requirements.,52,,
276,0.97,1277.109,1281.913,We're reliant on the levee and making sure that voters trust it is important.,52,,
277,0.97,1281.913,1284.983,Three specific proposals on the table that we support.,52,,
278,0.97,1284.983,1286.885,The Thomas Street proposal is good.,52,,
279,0.97,1286.885,1291.323,The South Park trail is fantastic.,52,,
280,0.97,1291.323,1295.093,And sidewalk repair in general is important as well for basic maintenance.,52,,
281,0.97,1295.093,1298.73,Thank you for your consideration and hope you're all doing well.,52,,
282,0.97,1298.73,1299.965,"Thanks so much, Gordon.",53,,
283,0.97,1299.965,1304.236,The next four people I'm going to read are not present but we do have you signed up.,53,,
284,0.97,1304.236,1324.423,If you dial back in before we end public comment we will get to you . We will go to number 18 Valerie Charlotte.,53,,
285,0.97,1324.423,1329.761,"Number 19, Celine Russo and MIA Mendoza.",53,,
286,0.97,1329.761,1330.662,"Valerie, good morning.",53,,
287,0.97,1330.662,1331.096,Good morning.,54,,
288,0.97,1331.096,1334.366,Sorry I lost track of what was going on.,54,,
289,0.97,1334.366,1338.537,I'm a resident of district 2.,54,,
290,0.97,1338.537,1341.239,I've been following policing in Seattle for ten years now.,54,,
291,0.97,1341.239,1347.379,I would like you to consider a different arrangement to the office of professional accountability.,54,,
292,0.97,1347.379,1348.68,It costs millions every year.,54,,
293,0.97,1348.68,1355.654,"And it only produces the appearance of accountability, not real accountability.",54,,
294,0.97,1355.654,1378.477,"If this SPD knew that it was truly accountable to the people who pay their salaries, we wouldn't have seen over many, many, many years belligerent police culture, police brutality, police killings that really shouldn't happen.",54,,
295,0.97,1378.477,1390.088,So I really--I'm just imploring you to really reconsider what you Fund and fund an entirely civilian body of police accountability.,54,,
296,0.97,1390.088,1393.525,Thank you.,54,,
297,0.97,1393.525,1397.796,"Thank you very much, Valerie.",55,,
298,0.97,1397.796,1399.698,"Celine, good morning.",55,,
299,0.97,1399.698,1405.036,Just Star 6 to Unmute yourself there.,55,,
300,0.97,1405.036,1406.905,And after Celine is MIA.,55,,
301,0.97,1406.905,1413.412,"Celine, if you can hear me, push Star 6 Unmute.",55,,
302,0.97,1413.412,1414.279,"Go ahead, please.",55,,
303,0.97,1414.279,1417.215,My name is Celine Russo.,56,,

305,0.97,1419.117,1425.757,I wanted to call in support of the solidarity budget.,56,,
306,0.97,1425.757,1433.031,There's been like people have said before we've given the police so many chances.,56,,
307,0.97,1433.031,1435.3,There's been years of internal changes being made.,56,,
308,0.97,1435.3,1436.368,And that has produced nothing.,56,,
309,0.97,1436.368,1439.337,So we need to cut their budget by 50%.,56,,
310,0.97,1439.337,1446.711,Especially in this time when we are cutting so many other budgets of crucial services.,56,,
311,0.97,1446.711,1449.281,"Bus routes, transportation projects, everything is being cut.",56,,
312,0.97,1449.281,1456.454,We also need to cut the police budget and we need to reinvest that money in solution that's have been proven.,56,,
313,0.97,1456.454,1460.125,There are active Community-Led solutions out there currently that are making real change.,56,,
314,0.97,1460.125,1464.796,And that's where we need to put that money.,56,,
315,0.97,1464.796,1466.832,So that is all.,56,,
316,0.97,1466.832,1467.933,Thank you.,56,,
317,0.97,1467.933,1472.504,"Thank you very much, Celine.",57,,
318,0.97,1472.504,1473.004,Mia.,57,,
319,0.97,1473.004,1473.338,Good morning.,57,,
320,0.97,1473.338,1478.009,Star 6 to Unmute yourself.,57,,

322,0.97,1478.31,1485.917,My name is MIA Mendoza from district 6. I had a whole thing prepared that was two minutes.,58,,
323,0.97,1485.917,1489.221,So I will message that to you guys.,58,,
324,0.97,1489.221,1498.163,But I just wanted to call in and talk about the inflated and mismanaged Seattle budget.,58,,
325,0.97,1498.163,1498.63,I just--sorry.,58,,
326,0.97,1498.63,1501.9,I had a whole thing prepared.,58,,
327,0.97,1501.9,1511.843,Basically friends of mine and members of our community have continuously this whole summer gotten their butts kicked by the Seattle police Department.,58,,
328,0.97,1511.843,1514.346,And we're paying for that.,58,,
329,0.97,1514.346,1518.65,$237Million of our money goes to them assaulting our community every year.,58,,
330,0.97,1518.65,1525.69,"When we could be supporting something like jump start Seattle, something that could actually help us in the wake of Covid-19.",58,,
331,0.97,1525.69,1531.963,Why would we take from that to give to our black community instead of taking from what is assaulting our community.,58,,
332,0.97,1531.963,1546.011,So I want us to consider that and also that even safe Seattle right wing Seattle group has started talking about how SPD isn't doing their job either to protect.,58,,
333,0.97,1546.011,1548.113,"Thank you very much, MIA.",59,,
334,0.97,1548.113,1551.816,Do send in your comments.,59,,

358,0.97,1618.45,1633.865,Sdot spent millions by adding a protected bike Lane from the U district and adding a Jersey barrier to protect pedestrians and others going downhill from district.,63,,
359,0.97,1633.865,1639.838,"Sdot found no delays to through put, no lost parking.",63,,
360,0.97,1639.838,1642.707,"The cost was estimated at $500,000 to a million dollars.",63,,
361,0.97,1642.707,1649.28,And the right time to do the work is when the route happens for 44.,63,,
362,0.97,1649.28,1658.123,Sdot eliminated the work as part of recent cutbacks we would like you to restore funding for the project or demand that it be done.,63,,
363,0.97,1658.123,1664.663,We would rather see the entire project delayed than this essential component cut.,63,,
364,0.97,1664.663,1669.501,The language to move mandates that Sdot do this before light rail opens --,63,,

396,0.97,1813.411,1822.954,"Those of us that walk on transit, poor people, elderly and disabled people are much more likely to--less likely to have a driver's license or access to cars.",69,,

398,0.97,1829.127,1841.773,"We need acceptable and well maintained sidewalks to get to transit or walk or roll to services, especially in communities that have faced historic Disinvestment.",69,,

420,0.97,1936.401,1936.634,Hi.,73,,
421,0.97,1936.634,1940.038,I've been a Protester since the beginning off and on basically.,73,,
422,0.97,1940.038,1945.043,I want to talk about one of my personal experiences.,73,,
423,0.97,1945.043,1957.555,"After being arrested on July 1ST, when chop was cleared out, me and a fellow Protester that evening were walking on 6th and James across by the all city bail bonds when the window broke out in silence.",73,,
424,0.97,1957.555,1961.125,And I turned to my Protester and I said did that actually happen?,73,,
425,0.97,1961.125,1961.459,He said okay.,73,,
426,0.97,1961.459,1964.529,I'm going to keep on walking.,73,,
427,0.97,1964.529,1965.763,We walked fast up the hill.,73,,
428,0.97,1965.763,1978.242,When we turned to our right in the--in that housing building to the right but sea a police officer going to an unmarked car in the 24-hour parking spot.,73,,
429,0.97,1978.242,1980.812,I continued on with my walking.,73,,
430,0.97,1980.812,1985.917,"Later that--later that week, I followed up with OPA.",73,,
431,0.97,1985.917,1989.587,It seems that SPD reported it about two hours later.,73,,
432,0.97,1989.587,1991.856,It was a 10-Millimeter socket that went through the window.,73,,
433,0.97,1991.856,1995.159,"Now, I think this was targeted Harassment.",73,,
434,0.97,1995.159,2000.164,Because I was in the jail yelling black lives matter and other chants.,73,,
435,0.97,2000.164,2005.77,And when I came out of the jail this is what happened to me.,73,,
436,0.97,2008.339,2010.742,"Daniel, thank you for sharing your story.",74,,

448,0.97,2065.963,2067.832,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",77,,
449,0.97,2067.832,2069.367,"Good morning, committee members.",77,,
450,0.97,2069.367,2075.173,I wanted to briefly update the Committee on a minor schedule change and the public.,77,,
451,0.97,2075.173,2082.947,"Tomorrow as the chair described today you will hear presentations on the parks Department, Department of transportation, and the police Department.",77,,
452,0.97,2082.947,2089.854,"Tomorrow you will hear presentations on community safety, human services, homelessness response and the city-wide Covid response.",77,,
453,0.97,2089.854,2099.297,I want to note for the record that we had human services Department and homelessness scheduled as one presentation in the afternoon.,77,,
454,0.97,2099.297,2116.681,"Given the number of Council member proposals and the cross cutting issues in the homelessness paper, we have separated it into two separate papers and the human services Dpartment will be in the morning session unless the community safety discussion runs long.",77,,
455,0.97,2116.681,2120.918,I wanted to flag that for everyone's information.,77,,
456,0.97,2120.918,2121.385,"Thank you, Aly.",78,,
457,0.97,2121.385,2123.421,Patty has already sent out the packet for tomorrow.,78,,
458,0.97,2123.421,2125.256,We want to thank them for that.,78,,
459,0.97,2125.256,2130.361,Are there any questions for Aly on the agenda for tomorrow?,78,,
460,0.97,2130.361,2130.561,Okay.,78,,
461,0.97,2130.561,2131.696,"I'm not seeing any, Aly.",78,,
462,0.97,2131.696,2133.097,"Anything else on your end, Aly.",78,,
463,0.97,2133.097,2136.667,I will turn it over to Traci.,79,,
464,0.97,2136.667,2137.001,Thank you.,79,,
465,0.97,2137.001,2137.368,Wonderful.,80,,
466,0.97,2137.368,2137.602,Thanks.,80,,
467,0.97,2137.602,2138.469,Good to see you.,80,,
468,0.97,2138.469,2141.038,"Good morning, Council members.",81,,
469,0.97,2141.038,2141.672,Traci Ratzliff central staff.,81,,
470,0.97,2141.672,2149.413,Today I will go over highlights from my issue identification paper for the Seattle parks and recreation Department.,81,,
471,0.97,2149.413,2155.987,Has been covered in prior presentations the pandemic has posed significant financial challenges in 2020.,81,,
472,0.97,2155.987,2159.957,They are expected to continue in 2021.,81,,
473,0.97,2159.957,2172.904,"Reduced user fees and rental income associated with the closure of many SPR facilities, and decrease real estate excise tax to the city all contribute to SPR's budget challenges.",81,,
474,0.97,2172.904,2182.046,The 2021 pro he posed budget assumes a gradual reopening of four pools as Permittd by public health guidelines.,81,,
475,0.97,2182.046,2194.592,"As superintendent Aguirre mentioned last night, their budget was built on the idea that phase 3 guidelines allowing up to 50% capacity of recreation facilities would be permitted.",81,,
476,0.97,2194.592,2201.232,As we know those guidelines have been modified to actually lower the capacity to 25%.,81,,
477,0.97,2201.232,2218.049,I raise this to highlight the uncertainty with which parks will be entering into the 2021 year and also to recognize that there could be further impacts Revenue-Wise to the parks Department that we might have to take up in the middle of 2021.,81,,
478,0.97,2218.049,2241.973,"My issue paper gets into detail about the proposed changes on both the capital and operating side that I will not go into today due to time limitations and the fact that we've had now--this will be our third session regarding the parks budget, having had the park presentation on the 2ND of October and last night's session on the spending plans specifically.",81,,
479,0.97,2241.973,2277.508,"As we heard last night and previously, in an effort to maintain SPR provided community services and a trained staff to deliver the services the proposed 2021 captures continued hiring freeze and Reallocating funding from the Mbd capital programs to operating programs to sustain SPR operations in 2021N addition the budget makes $19 million in reductions to refunded projects and programs.",81,,
480,0.97,2277.508,2284.515,Attachment one to my memo describes those specific changes to refunded programs and projects.,81,,
481,0.97,2284.515,2292.923,"Slide 1 shows the 2021 proposed operating budget is $175 million, which again is a slight decrease over the 2020 adopted budget.",81,,
482,0.97,2292.923,2305.803,"As you move to slide 2, we see that the proposed capital budget is $53 million or a decrease of $34 million over the 2020 budget.",81,,
483,0.97,2305.803,2317.848,"And, again this reflects the shift of funds to support operating costs and the $19 million reduction in parks support and capital programs.",81,,
484,0.97,2317.848,2320.451,Shown primarily from the capital reductions.,81,,
485,0.97,2320.451,2330.261,On the revenue side we can see the changes that happen in terms of the reduction Fund.,81,,
486,0.97,2330.261,2335.433,Those other resources reflect predominantly the fees generated from the parks facilities.,81,,
487,0.97,2335.433,2341.172,Are there any questions about this information?,81,,
488,0.97,2341.172,2352.383,If not I will move on to slide 3.,81,,
489,0.97,2352.383,2360.458,The Mpd may used for this purpose.,81,,
490,0.97,2360.458,2367.865,As we know from last night's discussion the Mpd's spending plan approved by the Council ended in 2020.,81,,
491,0.97,2367.865,2375.973,Spr did not--was not able to submit a new plan because of the pandemic.,81,,
492,0.97,2375.973,2391.155,"There was an interim spending plan by using the annual spending plan as the base budget, increasing it by the annual inflation rate that we used for the prior spending plans subpoena making modifications to address a general Fund and shortfalls.",81,,
493,0.97,2391.155,2406.337,"The proposed changes to the Mpd spending plan program that include operating costs versus one time costs will need to be supported in future years by the six-year spending plan, General fund or parks fees.",81,,
494,0.97,2406.337,2416.781,"Notwithstanding this, the Council could propose additional or different reductions to other funded programs to support Council related parks related priorities.",81,,
495,0.97,2416.781,2421.752,Any such changes could have problematic or staffing implications.,81,,
496,0.97,2421.752,2432.463,So your options really include to adopt the changes in the spending plan in the 2021 proposed budget or modify the spending plan to support project priorities.,81,,
497,0.97,2432.463,2436.333,Are there any questions about this issue?,81,,
498,0.97,2436.333,2439.87,"I don't see anyone raising their hand, Traci.",82,,
499,0.97,2439.87,2440.538,Okay.,83,,
500,0.97,2440.538,2442.64,Thank you Council member Gonzalez.,83,,
501,0.97,2442.64,2443.641,Let's move to slide 4 then.,83,,
502,0.97,2443.641,2447.645,I will now talk about the parks related budget legislation.,83,,
503,0.97,2447.645,2455.419,The first piece of legislation is the 2021-2022 fees and charges ordinance.,83,,
504,0.97,2455.419,2460.825,This ADOPTS the fee schedule for the next two years.,83,,
505,0.97,2460.825,2468.165,This establishes the charges that are incurred.,83,,
506,0.97,2468.165,2473.304,This includes pools rental for some of their parks facilities.,83,,
507,0.97,2473.304,2480.244,The proposed fees for 2021 and 2022 are unchanged from the 2020 ordinance.,83,,
508,0.97,2480.244,2493.524,That change or that--holding those fees steady was SPR's desired intent given the current economic downturn.,83,,
509,0.97,2493.524,2496.327,Moving on to the resolution.,83,,
510,0.97,2496.327,2505.87,So this legislation would authorize the city to provide a reduced level of General fund support due to the demanding economic circumstances caused by the pandemic.,83,,
511,0.97,2505.87,2515.779,Their local agreement between the city and park district requires a baseline amount of support adjusted annually for the inflation.,83,,
512,0.97,2515.779,2519.75,"In 2021, the general fund level of support would be $103 million.",83,,
513,0.97,2519.75,2527.157,As we have seen the Mayor's proposed budget provides $97 million.,83,,
514,0.97,2527.157,2541.138,If the Council determines that a natural disaster or challenging economic circumstance prevents the city from maintaining the general fund support and adopt resolution with two thirds approval.,83,,
515,0.97,2541.138,2548.979,This resolution would in fact provide that authorization to produce the general fund in 2021.,83,,
516,0.97,2548.979,2549.547,No questions about that.,83,,
517,0.97,2549.547,2552.75,I'll move on to the last one.,83,,
518,0.97,2552.75,2557.855,The third piece of legislation is the third quarter supplemental.,83,,
519,0.97,2557.855,2562.526,This addresses the $17.2 million of anticipated shortfall in the parks and recreation Fund.,83,,
520,0.97,2562.526,2573.037,It does this by reducing expenditures in the parks and recreation fund primarily from holding positions vacant and reducing hiring of temporary labor.,83,,
521,0.97,2573.037,2584.882,Appropriating $7 million in general fund reserves established during the revisions to the 2020 budget to off set what were anticipated to be the losses to the parks and Rec Fund.,83,,
522,0.97,2584.882,2587.985,Reducing capital projects by $5.3 million.,83,,
523,0.97,2587.985,2592.523,"And these projects include Smith Cove, the Queen Anne project.",83,,
524,0.97,2592.523,2596.927,And then finally reducing Mpd operating programs by $1.57 million.,83,,
525,0.97,2596.927,2600.431,Are there any questions about this legislation?,83,,
526,0.97,2600.431,2601.065,"Traci, thanks so much.",84,,
527,0.97,2601.065,2603.634,I have a question about this one.,84,,
528,0.97,2603.634,2619.583,In the memo it summarizes the components that go into the parks and Recreations Fund and the $3.31 million reduction from vacancies.,84,,
529,0.97,2619.583,2619.85,Yes.,85,,
530,0.97,2619.85,2628.826,"When we look at the golf program allocation, it is about a million dollars.",86,,
531,0.97,2628.826,2630.127,"$912,000 reduction there.",86,,
532,0.97,2630.127,2631.628,Yep.,87,,
533,0.97,2631.628,2632.162,Just offhand.,88,,
534,0.97,2632.162,2638.002,"I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to ask this earlier, can you put that into context?",88,,
535,0.97,2638.002,2645.709,I have understood from other conversations we've had the golf program is not revenue generating with our golf courses across the city.,88,,
536,0.97,2645.709,2650.047,This is just looking at the vacancies and temporary labor.,88,,
537,0.97,2650.047,2653.517,This isn't looking at reducing overall payments towards.,88,,
538,0.97,2653.517,2653.884,Correct.,89,,
539,0.97,2653.884,2656.553,This is actually a savings that they were able to generate this year.,89,,
540,0.97,2656.553,2661.792,"If you remember, the golf courses were closed for a certain period of time.",89,,
541,0.97,2661.792,2663.694,They were I think closed about 30 days.,89,,
542,0.97,2663.694,2681.311,"So they were able to reduce staffing and generate these savings of $900,000 next pen did $900,000 in expenditures.",89,,
543,0.97,2681.311,2685.716,They are only 4% behind budget for the year in terms of revenue.,89,,
544,0.97,2685.716,2686.383,They have recovered very well.,89,,
545,0.97,2686.383,2687.484,That is my second question.,90,,
546,0.97,2687.484,2692.89,Are they further in the hole given that they were not revenue generating.,90,,
547,0.97,2692.89,2696.26,Credit to the current operators of the golf courses.,91,,
548,0.97,2696.26,2705.102,They have been able to get people out on the courses and they had people in droves wanting to go golfing because apparently they can't go anywhere else.,91,,
549,0.97,2705.102,2710.074,As of the September report they were about 4% behind on their revenues for the year.,91,,
550,0.97,2710.074,2715.946,They had made up quite a bit of their revenue loss when they had been closed for that one month.,91,,
551,0.97,2715.946,2716.213,Okay.,92,,
552,0.97,2716.213,2718.449,Do you know offhand when the 4% equals?,92,,
553,0.97,2718.449,2722.252,"I want to say it is like $200,000.",93,,
554,0.97,2722.252,2722.619,Okay.,94,,
555,0.97,2722.619,2722.92,All right.,94,,
556,0.97,2722.92,2729.827,"Council members, any other General questions on number 3 here for quarter 3? thank you, Traci.",94,,
557,0.97,2729.827,2733.731,That answers my questions.,94,,
558,0.97,2733.731,2733.997,Okay.,95,,
559,0.97,2733.997,2734.264,Slide 6.,95,,
560,0.97,2734.264,2734.565,Sorry.,96,,
561,0.97,2734.565,2738.368,I actually have one too on this.,96,,
562,0.97,2738.368,2738.702,I'm sorry.,96,,
563,0.97,2738.702,2740.771,No worries.,97,,
564,0.97,2740.771,2742.306,Council member Pedersen.,98,,
565,0.97,2742.306,2746.51,I'm sorry if I was slow to see you both.,98,,
566,0.97,2746.51,2750.781,No worries there Madam chair.,99,,
567,0.97,2750.781,2755.119,Just talking about the--those various capital projects.,99,,
568,0.97,2755.119,2755.352,Yes.,100,,
569,0.97,2755.352,2757.221,That have been put on hold.,101,,
570,0.97,2757.221,2760.023,I know this is the case with Smith Cove.,101,,
571,0.97,2760.023,2764.962,And I asked director Aguirre about this or superintendent Aguirre about this yesterday.,101,,
572,0.97,2764.962,2765.262,Uh-huh.,102,,
573,0.97,2765.262,2777.307,But I'm curious how much money is tied up from other sources in Smith Cove in addition to the money only our side in our capital reductions.,103,,
574,0.97,2777.307,2777.608,Uh-huh.,104,,
575,0.97,2777.608,2779.243,And whether that is at risk.,105,,
576,0.97,2779.243,2784.681,"I would like to maybe see--if you can't answer with all of the details here, that's fine.",105,,
577,0.97,2784.681,2796.426,"I would like to maybe see a summary of, you know, how much money would potentially be at risk and whether that money could be put on hold until late tore resume those projects?",105,,
578,0.97,2796.426,2800.297,"Just because I know with Smith Cove in particular, there's been a lot of organizing.",105,,
579,0.97,2800.297,2800.597,Uh-huh.,106,,
580,0.97,2800.597,2802.399,Around that over the years.,107,,
581,0.97,2802.399,2802.733,You have.,108,,
582,0.97,2802.733,2805.402,To get that in place.,109,,
583,0.97,2805.402,2805.669,Yes.,110,,
584,0.97,2805.669,2809.373,Council member Bagshaw that was a big priority for her.,111,,
585,0.97,2809.373,2809.64,Yes.,112,,
586,0.97,2809.64,2815.045,Make sure if that is frozen that we are also able to rely later on.,112,,
587,0.97,2815.045,2815.345,Uh-huh.,113,,
588,0.97,2815.345,2817.514,The Intergovernmental funds for that project.,114,,
589,0.97,2817.514,2820.017,I wonder if you could touch on that a little bit.,114,,
590,0.97,2820.017,2820.35,I could.,115,,
591,0.97,2820.35,2832.129,"And then as far as the other projects in there too, if they're in a similar position where there might be money from other sources put at risk.",116,,
592,0.97,2832.129,2835.165,So I can tell you about Smith Cove.,117,,
593,0.97,2835.165,2845.642,"So Smith Cove had got a $250,000 grant from the county youth sports grant program.",117,,
594,0.97,2845.642,2848.278,"And then another $250,000 from the state recreation conservation office.",117,,
595,0.97,2848.278,2859.489,I need to follow up with parks to see what the requirements are for the spending of those dollars to see if a delay in this project will put those funds at risk.,117,,
596,0.97,2859.489,2863.827,And I already have that question into them from last night.,117,,
597,0.97,2863.827,2867.764,I believe the balance is about 2.5 or $2.6 million.,117,,
598,0.97,2867.764,2871.568,And I believe that is all our money.,117,,
599,0.97,2871.568,2879.576,"No other money coming in from other sources, I believe from my memory when I was looking at it earlier.",117,,
600,0.97,2879.576,2882.779,"The Prong in sound view, I have to look and see.",117,,
601,0.97,2882.779,2886.416,I'm not certain that those projects actually have any other money from them.,117,,
602,0.97,2886.416,2897.294,I think we actually have ended up between this action of the third quarter supplemental as well as the Mid-2020 budgetary vision.,117,,
603,0.97,2897.294,2900.931,We cut the entire funding which was the city's funding.,117,,
604,0.97,2900.931,2904.468,I will verify this between these two action that's we would be taking.,117,,
605,0.97,2904.468,2911.375,The one that has already been taken as part of the 2020 budgetary vision and as part of the third quarter supplemental.,117,,
606,0.97,2911.375,2915.646,I will check if there are any other sources of fund that are Non-City.,117,,
607,0.97,2915.646,2922.219,I don't think there is but I will check to make sure.,117,,
608,0.97,2922.219,2927.057,Appreciate that.,118,,
609,0.97,2927.057,2927.991,T you Traci ..,118,,
610,0.97,2927.991,2928.325,You bet.,119,,
611,0.97,2928.325,2945.175,I wanted to thank Traci and the superintendent last night during the meeting to tease out for me one of the line items that is not shown here on the chart is a pay increase that is going into effect for parks employees.,120,,
612,0.97,2945.175,2958.789,Since we might have a different audience today from the general public just to highlight the fact that there is a pay increase that is going into effect for parks employees.,120,,
613,0.97,2958.789,2961.124,It is quantified to about $1.3 million.,120,,
614,0.97,2961.124,2964.828,And so it is just--I think it is important for folks it know.,120,,
615,0.97,2964.828,2975.138,Sometimes the contracts that are negotiated were unions are done on a multi year basis.,120,,
616,0.97,2975.138,2982.612,These particular contracts were Inked last year when the economy was better Pre-Covid.,120,,
617,0.97,2982.612,2994.324,"It is something to think about, you know, that we have cuts happening on the one hand and on the other hand, there are pay increases going into effect for next year.",120,,
618,0.97,2994.324,3000.23,"So I just wanted to--is the $1.3 million, is that the approximate amount.",120,,
619,0.97,3000.23,3002.666,That's the amount that the Mpd would be funding.,121,,
620,0.97,3002.666,3011.775,I have to believe that the amount for all of the SPR staff for that pay raise is probably a little higher since they have about 800 or 900 employees.,121,,
621,0.97,3011.775,3016.713,"To be clear, council member, that is happening for every other Department.",121,,
622,0.97,3016.713,3023.553,"So human services, everybody else who has represented employees is seeing that 2.9% pay increase built in the budget.",121,,
623,0.97,3023.553,3025.555,They would be no exception to that.,121,,
624,0.97,3025.555,3025.822,Okay.,122,,
625,0.97,3025.822,3026.123,Thank you.,122,,
626,0.97,3026.123,3027.023,And you are correct.,123,,
627,0.97,3027.023,3033.263,They're part of the labor contracts that we cannot change unless we were to try to go into renegotiation.,123,,
628,0.97,3035.399,3036.333,Okay.,124,,
629,0.97,3036.333,3041.171,Maybe I'll follow up later to figure out how much is for the whole parks Department.,124,,
630,0.97,3041.171,3041.438,Sure.,125,,
631,0.97,3041.438,3041.738,I can ask.,125,,
632,0.97,3041.738,3047.878,If it is more than the 1.3 million.,126,,
633,0.97,3047.878,3048.111,Yep.,127,,
634,0.97,3048.111,3048.311,Yep.,127,,
635,0.97,3048.311,3049.012,Okay.,128,,
636,0.97,3049.012,3051.648,I'm not seeing any additional hands.,128,,
637,0.97,3051.648,3060.223,"Council member Juarez, you're always welcome to Chime in any time in case you have additional questions.",128,,
638,0.97,3060.223,3060.557,Okay.,129,,
639,0.97,3060.557,3061.691,I will keep going.,130,,
640,0.97,3061.691,3063.059,Move to slide 6 then.,131,,
641,0.97,3063.059,3068.331,These are the budget actions that have been proposed by Council members.,131,,
642,0.97,3068.331,3075.906,"Item number 1 would add $50,000 in funding to the neighborhood response program sponsored by Council member Lewis.",131,,
643,0.97,3075.906,3083.246,This provides funding for--to respond to issues raised by neighborhood organizations.,131,,
644,0.97,3083.246,3089.553,"And this program was cut by $50,000 in the proposed 2021 budget by the Mayor.",131,,
645,0.97,3096.259,3097.961,"Council member Lewis, you are up first.",132,,
646,0.97,3097.961,3099.896,I'll be brief on this one.,133,,
647,0.97,3099.896,3115.112,"I just think, you know, this is an important service, especially at a time when outreach in the parks is a very big issue that we've been dealing with, even through Covid.",133,,
648,0.97,3115.112,3135.565,"It is a fairly modest budget restoration to provide this service, to make sure that our parks and green spaces do have folks who can respond and be on the scene to help and address issues and collaborate with other city Department and service providers.",133,,
649,0.97,3135.565,3145.141,And just--just wanted to put this out there and make sure that we keep this in the budget now more than ever.,133,,
650,0.97,3145.141,3153.583,"And just to be clear, there is still $200,000 that remains in this program after that $50,000 cut.",134,,
651,0.97,3153.583,3157.721,And you can see that in attachment 1 to my memo.,134,,
652,0.97,3157.721,3161.992,It is showing what is being proposed for a cut and how much remains in the program.,134,,
653,0.97,3161.992,3164.628,"Thank you for that clarification, Traci.",135,,
654,0.97,3164.628,3167.164,"Sure, you bet.",136,,
655,0.97,3167.164,3169.065,Very helpful.,137,,
656,0.97,3169.065,3170.667,Hold for just one second.,137,,
657,0.97,3170.667,3171.201,Yep.,138,,
658,0.97,3171.201,3172.102,I see you're Unmuted.,139,,
659,0.97,3172.102,3179.643,Is there anything that you wanted to add for context as we go into the council member form as?,139,,
660,0.97,3179.643,3179.876,Yes.,140,,
661,0.97,3179.876,3180.644,I apologize.,140,,
662,0.97,3180.644,3183.146,I thought--I'm not--I'm Unmuted now.,140,,
663,0.97,3183.146,3188.652,I wanted to make just a few comments before we go into the eight requests.,140,,
664,0.97,3188.652,3193.79,Five which are Council member Lewis'.,140,,
665,0.97,3193.79,3203.4,This is just what we have learned from working absolutely with superintendent Aguirre in the past and Traci.,140,,
666,0.97,3203.4,3208.972,This is just a general where I'm at as chair to be candid.,140,,
667,0.97,3208.972,3218.081,"A lot of capital projects feasibility studies and programs, particularly the outdoor ones, are going to be on pause.",140,,
668,0.97,3218.081,3220.684,It is like what we're seeing at sound transit.,140,,
669,0.97,3220.684,3221.685,These programs are on pause.,140,,
670,0.97,3221.685,3228.024,"And some of you know the saying as a lawyer, delayed but not denied.",140,,
671,0.97,3228.024,3229.292,Only because we're dealing with Covid.,140,,
672,0.97,3229.292,3241.671,"And only because we have had to shift to Backfill the general Fund and have the opportunity, if you will.",140,,
673,0.97,3241.671,3247.444,We can actually use those funds for the general fund for the parks.,140,,
674,0.97,3247.444,3257.687,So I'm hoping and I think we're hoping that by the third quarter 2021 that things are going to look a lot different.,140,,
675,0.97,3257.687,3260.49,That's what we're shooting for.,140,,
676,0.97,3260.49,3263.293,I may be speaking out a little bit.,140,,
677,0.97,3263.293,3267.497,"I spoke about this with you, Madam chair, in my conversations with parks.",140,,
678,0.97,3267.497,3276.64,I'm not going to try to hold ourselves to the third quarter 2021.,140,,
679,0.97,3276.64,3282.912,I'm just not inclined--I understand where you're going on the salary RAISES and those are locked in on Union contracts.,140,,
680,0.97,3282.912,3298.561,"I want to give a big Shoutout because I don't think people understand or know this, a lot of the employees for the parks, we have not laid off anyone, our main goal was to keep staff in place.",140,,
681,0.97,3298.561,3301.097,Been doing things not in their job description.,140,,
682,0.97,3301.097,3305.802,Have been deployed in other area that's we need them the most.,140,,
683,0.97,3305.802,3314.01,"As you know, community centers, hand washing sanitation, doing things that they normally wouldn't do.",140,,
684,0.97,3314.01,3317.847,We had 60 people that volunteered to be park ambassadors.,140,,
685,0.97,3317.847,3335.031,"Again, I don't want to sound like a broken record but parks and library staff and leadership and their boards have really come through to fill in those holes and be that safety net for people who don't--who are experiencing homelessness.",140,,
686,0.97,3335.031,3337.367,And those front line workers who need child care.,140,,
687,0.97,3337.367,3346.643,"So I don't want to be, you know, Debbie Downer here, but I'm not Incollider to support any of these requests for those reasons.",140,,
688,0.97,3346.643,3350.08,Not that they're good projects and shouldn't go forward.,140,,
689,0.97,3350.08,3353.516,Just the basic--if anything ever got hit hard.,140,,
690,0.97,3353.516,3353.917,Everything did.,140,,
691,0.97,3353.917,3363.36,But a lot of these programs require us to be in community and require us to be outside and require us to either act to build these big projects.,140,,
692,0.97,3363.36,3365.795,So that is where we're at right now.,140,,
693,0.97,3365.795,3367.597,I just want to share that.,140,,
694,0.97,3367.597,3370.066,And I'm trying not to sound so negative.,140,,
695,0.97,3370.066,3374.304,But I just want to be very up and transparent.,140,,
696,0.97,3374.304,3374.838,"Thank you, Madam chair.",140,,
697,0.97,3374.838,3375.772,Thank you.,141,,
698,0.97,3375.772,3379.008,"And thank you for that context, council member Juarez.",141,,
699,0.97,3379.008,3389.619,"I also think about many of the essential workers that receive, for example, hazard pay or Covid support pay as they were putting themselves in harm's way to take care of our community.",141,,
700,0.97,3389.619,3395.892,And I think a lot of our parks folks are providing critical services as you just articulated.,141,,
701,0.97,3395.892,3401.631,I want to echo your appreciation for their work and thank you for putting that into context.,141,,
702,0.97,3401.631,3401.865,Okay.,141,,
703,0.97,3401.865,3406.002,I see no additional comments on number 1 here.,141,,
704,0.97,3406.002,3408.405,"Council President, good to see you again.",142,,
705,0.97,3408.405,3412.876,Glad you're feeling a little better.,142,,
706,0.97,3412.876,3414.411,Appreciate you being with us today.,142,,
707,0.97,3414.411,3414.844,Thank you.,143,,
708,0.97,3414.844,3423.72,I'm going to ask some general questions about the parks budget in light of a couple of remarks that I have heard.,143,,
709,0.97,3423.72,3437.801,I appreciate Council member Juarez reminding us of those practical challenges and realities as it relates to the CIP proposed funding in particular.,143,,
710,0.97,3437.801,3455.919,"On attachment A-1, Traci, there's a--there's about eight capital improvement projects that show nothing proposed for 2021.",143,,
711,0.97,3455.919,3459.656,And then a reduction for--for Reit dollars.,143,,
712,0.97,3459.656,3464.961,In the notes it says that the funding is eliminated in the six-year CIP.,143,,
713,0.97,3464.961,3466.062,Uh-huh.,144,,
714,0.97,3466.062,3478.107,"So am I reading this correctly, that means that those eight projects are effectively eliminated and not moving forward or is this trying to communicate something else?",145,,
715,0.97,3478.107,3478.374,Yeah.,146,,
716,0.97,3478.374,3487.083,"That is saying for the next six years, the executive is proposing that there not be any refunding for those projects.",146,,
717,0.97,3487.083,3495.158,I suspect that this will be Revisited once the economy improves and depending on what the draws are.,146,,
718,0.97,3495.158,3501.297,We've had a slash I think half of our refunding.,146,,
719,0.97,3501.297,3505.401,So they are making projections about what that is looking like.,146,,
720,0.97,3505.401,3518.014,"That is their proposal to eliminate not only for 2021 but the remainder of that six-year planning period, the funding for those specific activities.",146,,
721,0.97,3518.014,3518.281,Okay.,147,,
722,0.97,3518.281,3543.673,"So that includes comfort station renovation, roof and building envelope program, ball fields, minor capital improvements, court restoration program, play area safety program, environmental remediation program, the ball field lighting replacement program, and the boiler and mechanical system replacement program.",147,,
723,0.97,3543.673,3551.781,I guess it would be helpful to get a little more detail about exactly what those programs are.,147,,
724,0.97,3551.781,3557.153,"Or more importantly, what is the impact of the elimination.",147,,
725,0.97,3557.153,3560.189,Not just the physical impact but the impacts of those.,147,,
726,0.97,3560.189,3570.533,It is unclear to me whether the elimination is being proposed because they're effectively done or far enough that we're pulling back.,147,,
727,0.97,3570.533,3576.005,Or sort of like where is the--where are they in the stage of those various programs.,147,,
728,0.97,3576.005,3576.372,Uh-huh.,148,,
729,0.97,3576.372,3581.811,That would be helpful to understand.,149,,
730,0.97,3581.811,3582.078,Sure.,150,,
731,0.97,3582.078,3583.079,Okay.,151,,
732,0.97,3583.079,3584.013,Go ahead.,152,,
733,0.97,3584.013,3584.28,Yeah.,153,,
734,0.97,3584.28,3594.457,"And then the--the second thing I wanted to ask, I didn't see in the memo--I saw just a brief description about what the neighborhood response program is.",153,,
735,0.97,3594.457,3594.757,Uh-huh.,154,,
736,0.97,3594.757,3601.197,It just says that the program provides funding for unplanned projects identified by a neighborhood organization.,155,,
737,0.97,3601.197,3602.398,I'm not sure what that means.,155,,
738,0.97,3602.398,3615.545,"So my understanding is that it can mean, you know, something happens at a local park that was not budgeted that could be dealt with in--with a small amount of money.",156,,
739,0.97,3615.545,3620.45,"And so the superintendent essentially, you know, works with the community to address that specific thing.",156,,
740,0.97,3620.45,3624.22,And this program helps to address that specific thing.,156,,
741,0.97,3624.22,3629.826,I can't remember if one of the conversations being set on fire was one of the examples.,156,,
742,0.97,3629.826,3634.23,I think back in my notes I have examples of the types things.,156,,
743,0.97,3634.23,3638.835,It was the unplanned One-Off thing that the community RAISES up.,156,,
744,0.97,3638.835,3645.641,This is an urgent issue that we have to deal with and this helps the superintendent deal with that issue in real time.,156,,
745,0.97,3645.641,3648.311,These are discretionary dollars.,157,,
746,0.97,3648.311,3648.544,Yes.,158,,
747,0.97,3648.544,3653.783,And therefore sort of small sized.,159,,
748,0.97,3653.783,3654.25,Yes.,160,,
749,0.97,3654.25,3655.485,That's my understanding.,160,,
750,0.97,3655.485,3658.888,Infrastructure maintenance projects.,161,,
751,0.97,3658.888,3659.122,Yep.,162,,
752,0.97,3659.122,3659.322,Yep.,162,,
753,0.97,3659.322,3659.589,Correct.,162,,
754,0.97,3659.589,3660.123,That's my understanding.,162,,
755,0.97,3660.123,3660.456,Helpful.,163,,
756,0.97,3660.456,3660.723,Yeah.,164,,
757,0.97,3660.723,3665.461,"And the last thing I want--it is a comment, not a question.",165,,
758,0.97,3665.461,3678.441,I just want to be mindful of the conversation around payroll increases for city employees.,165,,
759,0.97,3678.441,3679.942,Particularly for would reasons.,165,,
760,0.97,3679.942,3685.081,The first being that we are a high road employer at the city of Seattle.,165,,
761,0.97,3685.081,3692.955,And that means that we have a significant amount of bargaining units at the city.,165,,
762,0.97,3692.955,3704.667,At last count we had about 156 bargaining units with various unions across the city family.,165,,
763,0.97,3704.667,3733.563,"And I--and the appropriate lace to have conversations about salaries for employees and specifically Awi increases that have been approved already by the city Council and that are me Moralized in the contract, that those conversations be had with the select waiver committee and eventually through the labor relations policy committee as required by Seattle municipal code.",165,,
764,0.97,3733.563,3771.534,"Secondly as we continue to have conversations about Awi proposals that have already been approved, commitments, I should say, not proposals anymore, contractual commitments, that we keep in mind the significance of proposing not to move forward with those commitments without really evaluating and taking into consideration the risk and social justice impacts of proposed reductions in those Awis, in addition to our obligation to continue to negotiate in good faith with our labor departments on those particular issues.",165,,
765,0.97,3771.534,3774.804,I just want us to be mindful of that.,165,,
766,0.97,3774.804,3782.778,And that doesn't mean that we're not going to have those conversations with our labor partners.,165,,
767,0.97,3782.778,3801.497,And it also means that we will continue to make sure that we are looking at ways to not lay off a significant amount of employees or any employees at all if we can through this economic period in the city.,165,,
768,0.97,3801.497,3812.108,But I just want to really lift up those--those points as it relates to ongoing concerns about salary increases.,165,,
769,0.97,3812.108,3830.226,And parks I think is one of the departments where we see a huge--sometimes a very large disparity in pay between field workers and--and management and people who are in the field within parks.,165,,
770,0.97,3830.226,3848.277,"So for me, the Rsji impacts of exploring a roll back on Awis is--is pretty acute in terms of my concerns around Rsji impacts.",165,,
771,0.97,3848.277,3862.758,I wanted to make a comment about that as I continue to hear about the potential to pull back on commitments the city has made with labor partners around Awi increases.,165,,
772,0.97,3862.758,3863.492,"Thank you, chair.",165,,
773,0.97,3863.492,3865.261,"Thank you, Council President.",166,,
774,0.97,3865.261,3868.965,I really appreciate your questions and the last comment as well.,166,,
775,0.97,3868.965,3875.004,Look forward to having more conversations about how we support our city family as we move forward.,166,,
776,0.97,3972.601,3982.044,That seemed the more appropriate place for t we will be able to track because we can at the BSL level and the program level their expenditures and so forth.,167,,
777,0.97,3982.044,3985.181,There is no loss to it being moved into that program at all.,167,,
778,0.97,3985.181,3986.716,I see.,168,,
779,0.97,3986.716,3988.718,Thank you very much.,168,,
780,0.97,3988.718,3991.554,The footnote is right under the chart.,168,,
781,0.97,3991.554,3997.927,So it is the Seattle conservation core moved to the Department wide programs.,168,,
782,0.97,3997.927,3998.227,Correct.,169,,
783,0.97,3998.227,3999.028,Okay.,170,,
784,0.97,3999.028,4000.629,Thank you very much.,171,,
785,0.97,4000.629,4000.896,Yep.,172,,
786,0.97,4000.896,4001.53,Yep.,172,,
787,0.97,4001.53,4002.732,Thanks for reading my memo.,173,,
788,0.97,4002.732,4005.201,It is nice to know you that read.,173,,
789,0.97,4005.201,4005.668,Yeah.,174,,
790,0.97,4005.668,4006.736,We never quite know.,175,,
791,0.97,4006.736,4009.472,You put a lot of work into these.,176,,
792,0.97,4009.472,4013.109,You and the whole team.,176,,
793,0.97,4013.109,4013.342,Yes.,177,,
794,0.97,4013.342,4017.446,We really appreciate t I love the footnotes in the memo coming up.,178,,
795,0.97,4017.446,4018.714,"Thank you for that, Traci.",178,,
796,0.97,4018.714,4021.517,I'm sorry did Miss that underneath the chart there.,178,,
797,0.97,4021.517,4024.019,A lot of information to cover.,179,,
798,0.97,4024.019,4024.787,It is complex here.,179,,
799,0.97,4024.787,4027.056,This is a complex year.,179,,
800,0.97,4027.056,4027.323,It is.,180,,
801,0.97,4027.323,4029.158,And your memos really help us out.,180,,
802,0.97,4029.158,4029.825,We appreciate that.,180,,
803,0.97,4029.825,4033.362,And I know the viewing public does as well.,180,,
804,0.97,4033.362,4034.13,Council member Herbold.,180,,
805,0.97,4034.13,4035.831,A question from you.,180,,
806,0.97,4035.831,4036.298,Yes.,181,,
807,0.97,4036.298,4036.632,Thank you.,181,,
808,0.97,4036.632,4040.369,Also as it relates to the memo.,181,,
809,0.97,4040.369,4051.18,It says that the proposed budget assumes SPR will hold 68 positions vacant for the entirety of 2021.,181,,
810,0.97,4097.026,4102.364,Let's go on to number two in our issue identification formation here.,182,,
811,0.97,4102.364,4107.67,For the viewing public we're on page 7 of the memo as well.,182,,
812,0.97,4167.63,4179.875,I'm certainly open to figuring something out if we can in fact get an extension on those grants or some other kind of arrangement.,183,,
813,0.97,4179.875,4200.696,"As I mentioned earlier, this project came together with extensive organizing work from constituents in district 7 as well as work from Council member office and other critical shareholders.",183,,
814,0.97,4200.696,4221.55,"I want to make sure as we are putting things on hold, given the very real budget constraints and issues presented by Covid, we're making sure that some of the resources from our partners stay intact as this is temporarily frozen to be resumed later.",183,,
815,0.97,4221.55,4223.452,If that can be worked out I'm open to it.,183,,
816,0.97,4223.452,4237.7,Otherwise it is something that I would like to potentially pursue going forward with if it would mean losing half a million dollars from other entities and is certainly a very important project in the district.,183,,
817,0.97,4241.17,4243.272,Thank you very much.,184,,
818,0.97,4243.272,4246.542,"Seeing no other questions, Traci, let's do number 3.",184,,
819,0.97,4246.542,4255.017,Let's move to slide 7. item number 3. add funding for the development of a new dog off leash area at Mercer and Dexter.,185,,
820,0.97,4255.017,4257.386,The funding amount would be to be determined.,185,,
821,0.97,4257.386,4275.604,"And it would be used to acquire property currently owned by the Sdot and also be used to develop the infrastructure needed to service the off leash area, including water hookup and a double gauged fence ..",185,,
822,0.97,4275.604,4289.251,This is a site in the district that I've been talking to the community,186,,
823,0.97,4486.348,4489.952,In these really important spaces.,187,,
824,0.97,4489.952,4494.056,This is just a number that they provided.,187,,
825,0.97,4494.056,4505.501,I don't know what the final--if there might be a way to reduce it going into the next phase to get at what they need to provide this extra assistance.,187,,
826,0.97,4505.501,4510.672,But I did want to bring this forward.,187,,
827,0.97,4510.672,4514.409,They're great partners in district 7 and excellent partners in discovery park.,187,,
828,0.97,4514.409,4523.619,"And, you know, what is happening to these really important gathering spaces is really concerning to me and a lot of members of the community.",187,,
829,0.97,4523.619,4532.027,I wanted to bring this forward to this forum and make sure that we could see if there is something that we can do to help alleviate this problem.,187,,
830,0.97,4532.027,4534.363,"Thank you, council member Lewis.",188,,
831,0.97,4534.363,4542.638,And I would say I could distribute that letter that I received from them as well if any Council offices are interested.,189,,
832,0.97,4542.638,4543.839,Thank you so much.,190,,
833,0.97,4543.839,4547.175,Any other questions or comments on this item?,190,,
834,0.97,4547.175,4548.076,Okay.,190,,
835,0.97,4548.076,4561.223,"Seeing none, let's move to slide 8 and to item number 5 which is the adoption of a statement of legislative intent to determine activation strategies for the East Queen Anne Greenbelt.",190,,
836,0.97,4561.223,4568.43,This is a study undertaken by parks and neighborhoods to conduct a feasibility study for activating this Greenbelt.,190,,
837,0.97,4568.43,4571.099,This is Council member Lewis.,190,,
838,0.97,4571.099,4572.834,Council member Lewis.,191,,
839,0.97,4572.834,4576.104,I know exactly what Greenbelt you're talking about.,191,,
840,0.97,4576.104,4577.739,I used to live right there.,191,,
841,0.97,4577.739,4578.273,Tell us more.,191,,
842,0.97,4578.273,4587.049,"This has been--it is not only the Greenbelt but also adjacent there is a park, Mclane park.",192,,
843,0.97,4587.049,4593.221,This has been a particular area of interest for the Queen Anne community Council for a while.,192,,
844,0.97,4593.221,4599.227,There's been great community interest in potentially developing a dog Park here as well.,192,,
845,0.97,4599.227,4604.466,There's been questions about the suitability of the site.,192,,
846,0.97,4604.466,4612.541,But it is a Greenbelt within an attendant fairly undeveloped park.,192,,
847,0.97,4612.541,4615.844,It is not really maintained or activated.,192,,
848,0.97,4615.844,4628.757,Certainly an area that would probably be a good candidate for some kind of project in the next metropolitan parks district.,192,,
849,0.97,4628.757,4640.469,It is to engage with community Stakeholders to develop some kind of activation strategy that could then be rolled into some kind of capital plan under the metropolitan park district.,192,,
850,0.97,4640.469,4646.141,And I know there's been a lot of community interest around this in looking at a strategy.,192,,
851,0.97,4646.141,4653.849,And I'm sure if you used to live nearby Council member Mosqueda you could see that there's a lot of potential here in the space.,192,,
852,0.97,4653.849,4665.994,It is a pretty big piece of Parkland that is not really in a current state of use to be used for recreational purposes.,192,,
853,0.97,4665.994,4674.102,"So, you know, it would be--it would certainly be a good opportunity to look towards in the next round of capital improvements.",192,,
854,0.97,4674.102,4682.878,And this would be a good start to facilitate a Visioning process on what we could do in that space.,192,,
855,0.97,4682.878,4683.211,Excellent.,193,,
856,0.97,4683.211,4685.213,"Thank you, council member Lewis.",193,,
857,0.97,4685.213,4686.815,"Any questions on this, colleagues?",193,,
858,0.97,4686.815,4687.049,Okay.,193,,
859,0.97,4687.049,4687.916,I am not seeing any.,193,,
860,0.97,4687.916,4689.351,Let's move to number 6.,193,,
861,0.97,4689.351,4701.697,"Moving to item number 6. so this proposal would add $200,000 in funding for feasibility study to assess the community gathering space needed.",194,,
862,0.97,4701.697,4702.597,This is Council member Morales.,194,,
863,0.97,4702.597,4705.0,Please go ahead Council member Morales.,195,,
864,0.97,4705.0,4707.636,"Thank you, chair.",196,,
865,0.97,4707.636,4709.671,"Thank you so much, Traci.",196,,
866,0.97,4709.671,4718.68,So I'm sure everyone knows that Georgetown has a lack of green space.,196,,
867,0.97,4718.68,4722.25,There is the Georgetown play field and the small little park.,196,,
868,0.97,4722.25,4729.958,But there's not a lot of place in the neighborhood for kids to play outdoors.,196,,
869,0.97,4729.958,4744.673,"And so when the Georgetown play field was built, I think there was a request for community center because there isn't a gathering space in the neighborhood.",196,,
870,0.97,4744.673,4760.689,So what we're trying to do is assess what it would take to be able to plan for and build a community center in the neighborhood.,196,,
871,0.97,4760.689,4765.494,It is problematic in that it is not the neighborhood kids that are able to use the play field.,196,,
872,0.97,4765.494,4772.367,It is often reserved for Soccer games and Soccer tournaments and other organized sporting events.,196,,
873,0.97,4772.367,4777.305,Very often from outside group that's come into the neighborhood.,196,,
874,0.97,4777.305,4777.606,Great.,197,,
875,0.97,4777.606,4787.349,There is a real need for some designated space and we are looking into --,198,,
876,0.97,4787.349,4789.851,We might be able to mute Council member Herbold.,199,,
877,0.97,4789.851,4791.987,I think she is doing--thank you so much.,199,,
878,0.97,4791.987,4798.66,We are all trying to work as hard as we can to multi task.,199,,
879,0.97,4798.66,4800.629,"Council member Morales, if you could start that over.",199,,
880,0.97,4800.629,4801.396,That would be great.,199,,
881,0.97,4801.396,4813.842,We are trying to get funding to do the feasibility study and assess what it would take to design and build a community center.,200,,
882,0.97,4813.842,4819.948,They want to begin the process.,200,,
883,0.97,4819.948,4825.453,Are there questions on this item.,201,,
884,0.97,4851.68,4863.892,Council member Lewis is saying let's direct the Department neighborhood to use their staffing capacity to conduct a feasibility study for activates these Queen Anne Greenbelt.,202,,
885,0.97,4863.892,4864.459,Certainly an alternative.,202,,
886,0.97,4864.459,4877.172,I need to check because I know as parks is getting ready for the six-year spending plan that they have done a strategic plan that assesses what the city wide needs are for community centers.,202,,
887,0.97,4877.172,4880.642,That is based on current population and estimates about population growth.,202,,
888,0.97,4880.642,4889.851,They may have already done work on this as it relates to the Georgetown area.,202,,
889,0.97,4889.851,4907.769,But it says parks can you assess the feasibility of the recreation and gathering needs and see whether they would be willing to do that body of work without additional resources as an alternative to Council member Morales' proposal which is similar to what Council member Lewis is saying.,202,,
890,0.97,4907.769,4909.904,Did you have something to add to that.,203,,
891,0.97,4909.904,4910.171,Yes.,204,,
892,0.97,4910.171,4920.081,I thought I would take this opportunity to say more generally about statements of legislative intent versus Council budget actions that increase or decrease funding for a department.,204,,
893,0.97,4920.081,4923.151,It is somewhat of a balancing act.,204,,
894,0.97,4923.151,4929.791,Statement of legislative intent can just be a statement of the counsel's legislative intent.,204,,
895,0.97,4929.791,4940.001,It is often request to a Department to take up specific work in the coming Yeah.,204,,
896,0.97,4940.001,4946.775,Is this asking them to do something that is different than the work that they would be doing otherwise.,204,,
897,0.97,4946.775,4956.918,"If so, is additional funding needed or is this something that staff generally takes this on and can be absorbed into their normal--normal operations?",204,,
898,0.97,4956.918,4960.855,So it is sometimes a balance that Traci was just sort of highlighting.,204,,
899,0.97,4960.855,4966.428,"If some work has been done, there may be ability for the Department to just take on this work.",204,,
900,0.97,4966.428,4985.113,But in many cases statements of legislative intent sometimes are responded to in a way that may not be fulfill the request.,204,,
901,0.97,4985.113,4992.787,Highlighting it is a balancing act in thinking through the resources of the Department versus what needs additional funding.,204,,
902,0.97,4992.787,4993.054,Okay.,205,,
903,0.97,4993.054,4993.288,Great.,205,,
904,0.97,4993.288,4995.09,"Council member Morales, anything else to add to this?",205,,
905,0.97,4995.09,5005.834,"Well, just that I'm happy to meet with you or talk with you, Traci, and see if we can dig into that a little to understand if it is slated to begin.",206,,
906,0.97,5005.834,5012.073,"And if it is not, we can move on to form B and figure out Wat it should look like.",206,,
907,0.97,5012.073,5014.175,Sounds good.,207,,
908,0.97,5023.585,5025.82,Let's go on to slide 9. yes.,208,,
909,0.97,5025.82,5031.659,So this would adopt a statement of legislative intent regarding Signage.,208,,
910,0.97,5031.659,5044.939,"This would ask the parks Department to work with the tribe to design and place Signage at Lipton Springs, discussing the cultural significance of the Springs.",208,,
911,0.97,5044.939,5046.041,This is Council member Sawant.,208,,
912,0.97,5046.041,5051.646,"Good morning, council member Sawant.",209,,
913,0.97,5051.646,5051.913,Go ahead.,209,,
914,0.97,5051.913,5061.89,This would request the parks Department to work with the tribe's cultural Department to design historical Signage and Lipton Springs.,210,,
915,0.97,5061.89,5067.228,Indigenous activists in Seattle as we know have been organizing for several years to uplift the history of Lipton Springs.,210,,
916,0.97,5067.228,5081.142,This past year they appealed to the landmarks preservation board and land marked the Springs which I believe is the first time that the landmark preservation board has preserved something other than a building.,210,,
917,0.97,5081.142,5101.796,"More than 3,000 people signed the petition supporting that Landmarking, explaining that, quote, since time in Memorial Lipton Springs has been a recognized sacred site and a natural curative resource for the tribes of the Puget sound region.",210,,
918,0.97,5101.796,5112.907,"For countless generations people have gathered at Lipton Springs to harvest the medicine used for traditional healing, ceremony, spiritual renewal and celebrations.",210,,
919,0.97,5112.907,5118.88,Lipton Springs is one of the last remaining Holy places of the people.,210,,
920,0.97,5118.88,5125.82,"That is from the petition that 3,000 people signed.",210,,
921,0.97,5125.82,5135.33,"And I wanted to congratulate all of the organizations, urban educational Alliance for spear heading that petition.",210,,
922,0.97,5135.33,5143.771,I will end by saying community activists are requesting that the parks Department work with the cultural Department to honor the history.,210,,
923,0.97,5144.906,5147.475,"Thank you very much, council member Sawant.",211,,
924,0.97,5147.475,5149.811,Any questions or comments?,211,,
925,0.97,5152.28,5153.548,I'm seeing none.,211,,
926,0.97,5153.548,5154.883,Let's go to number 8.,211,,
927,0.97,5154.883,5168.363,The final item would be to add funding of $48 million to Backfill the loss of General Fund and other resources to the Department of parks and recreation in the 2021 proposed budget.,212,,
928,0.97,5168.363,5169.797,This is Council member Sawant's proposal.,212,,
929,0.97,5169.797,5171.833,"Thank you, council member Sawant.",213,,
930,0.97,5171.833,5172.667,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",214,,
931,0.97,5172.667,5187.749,"Lie I mentioned in the budget committee meeting that we had Friday, the budget proposed by the Mayor includes slashing funding to transportation and libraries.",214,,
932,0.97,5187.749,5189.951,The Mayor has proposed cutting 48 million.,214,,
933,0.97,5189.951,5203.031,41Million here in the 2021 proposed budget that she has sent to the Council and $407 million in the supplemental budget for a total of $48 million.,214,,
934,0.97,5203.031,5207.669,The budget proposes closing community centers and pools and deferring maintenance and other capital work.,214,,
935,0.97,5207.669,5216.511,However as we discussed on Friday and as many Council Mens stated there is nothing inevitable about these budget cuts.,214,,
936,0.97,5216.511,5217.812,It is a policy decision.,214,,
937,0.97,5217.812,5235.997,"By--if the budget cuts go through, then they would be a policy decision by a political establishment that would rather close community centers than increase the taxes on big business we we know is a viable and legal Avenue for us to shore up the budget to eliminate all of the cuts.",214,,
938,0.97,5235.997,5251.045,This budget amendment would restore the $48 million being proposed with the intention that it should increase the Amazon tax that I won't go over in Detailsa presented it last Friday in the budget committee meeting.,214,,
939,0.97,5251.045,5251.346,Thank you.,214,,
940,0.97,5251.346,5255.149,Thank you very much.,215,,
941,0.97,5255.149,5256.15,"Any questions, colleagues?",215,,
942,0.97,5256.15,5256.351,Okay.,215,,
943,0.97,5256.351,5258.119,I do have a question for clarification.,215,,
944,0.97,5258.119,5265.86,I think this gets back to some of the charts that have been offered on the first page of many of the memos we have reviewed.,215,,
945,0.97,5265.86,5274.836,"For example, when I asked the question about conservation, if you look at the chart and not the footnote it looks like conservation court is zeroed out.",215,,
946,0.97,5274.836,5276.037,It says is hundred percent cut.,215,,
947,0.97,5276.037,5280.375,"But if you look at the details, it is a transfer.",215,,
948,0.97,5280.375,5305.7,"Just for clarification on the parks, when we talk about $48 million to Backfill the proposed cuts as Council member Sawant just articulated is part of the 48 million including transfers and those programs are actually being maintained in other departments in can you offer clarification on whether there is 48 million in total cuts here?",215,,
949,0.97,5305.7,5305.933,No.,216,,
950,0.97,5305.933,5315.543,If you do the map between 261 and 228 you get a $41 million reduction between the 2020-2021 budget.,216,,
951,0.97,5315.543,5319.28,I don't know where the $48 million figure came from.,216,,
952,0.97,5319.28,5322.75,It was on form A. maybe coups member Sawant can explain that.,216,,
953,0.97,5322.75,5323.017,Okay.,217,,
954,0.97,5323.017,5324.385,"Council member Sawant, anything to add to that.",217,,
955,0.97,5324.385,5327.522,I mean we can look at it again.,218,,
956,0.97,5327.522,5330.224,We're always happy to keep making sure that our numbers are right.,218,,
957,0.97,5330.224,5346.774,"But as far as my office has checked and we have checked multiple times, $41 million is the cut to the general fund to parks, plus the 7 million in the 2020 third quarter supplemental budget is what we are aware of.",218,,
958,0.97,5346.774,5347.041,Okay.,219,,
959,0.97,5347.041,5348.109,"Thank you, council member Sawant.",219,,
960,0.97,5348.109,5349.977,I may follow up with you as well.,219,,
961,0.97,5349.977,5369.597,"I think it is important for us to just make sure that the viewing public as well knows if there is an overall reduction, are those services going away or in some cases are there service that's are being accounted for as a cut but they're actually being transferred to other areas just so that we are--go ahead, council member Sawant.",219,,
962,0.97,5369.597,5369.931,I'm sorry.,220,,
963,0.97,5369.931,5372.834,I didn't mean to interrupt you.,220,,
964,0.97,5372.834,5373.167,I apologize.,220,,
965,0.97,5373.167,5383.411,"I forgot to add that as far as I understand the $41 million figure actually in the Mayor's--in her budget, in the introduction.",220,,
966,0.97,5383.411,5385.78,I'm not sure why central staff are not seeing that.,220,,
967,0.97,5385.78,5388.649,We will check back in with central staff.,220,,
968,0.97,5388.649,5389.817,We didn't derive the number.,220,,
969,0.97,5389.817,5391.085,It is actually there.,220,,
970,0.97,5391.085,5393.421,I just want to share that that.,220,,
971,0.97,5393.421,5395.423,Yeah.,221,,
972,0.97,5395.423,5399.093,I think central staff is accurate.,221,,
973,0.97,5399.093,5399.527,Is there a cut?,221,,
974,0.97,5399.527,5404.699,And I think you're also accurate there is a reduction in the overall Department.,221,,
975,0.97,5404.699,5416.811,"The question I'm asking is really for the viewing public and for all of our Council colleagues, is it an actual cut in services which is different has the money been transferred to other departments?",221,,
976,0.97,5416.811,5427.421,I want to make sure that you hear where I'm coming from in my question and central staff hears that I'm saying I fully support the answer that they provided as well.,221,,
977,0.97,5427.421,5428.422,It could mean both.,221,,
978,0.97,5428.422,5439.5,"And you could see an overall reduction by 48 million which you and your team are Articulating and what central staff is saying, in terms of cuts, there is less of a cut.",221,,
979,0.97,5439.5,5443.171,It does not total 48 million when you look at where those transfers have occurred.,221,,
980,0.97,5443.171,5449.777,So I just want to make sure that we're clear when we talk about where there are actual cuts.,221,,
981,0.97,5449.777,5451.345,And where there are some transfers.,221,,
982,0.97,5451.345,5456.651,But I think both are accurate.,221,,
983,0.97,5456.651,5466.761,"I don't want to Impugn anyone's good work here, including your team as well, council member Sawant and central staff.",221,,
984,0.97,5466.761,5499.093,"I recall one of the key Take- Aways from our original revenue Overviews was there was a city wide, Department wide, the number that I think central staff gave us, it was through all departments $27 million in spending reductions.",222,,
985,0.97,5499.093,5503.931,I'Mhappy to.,223,,
986,0.97,5503.931,5515.676,"So it is in looking at the details of the Mayor's proposed budget, if you look line by line, every cut is sort of listed separately.",223,,
987,0.97,5515.676,5518.012,And then adds are often listed separately.,223,,
988,0.97,5518.012,5530.591,"As an example of how we get to the net for the creation of the office of emergency management, about $2.5 million is cut from SPD's budget.",223,,
989,0.97,5530.591,5536.53,And then a similar amount is added to the new office of emergency management.,223,,
990,0.97,5536.53,5543.304,"There's about a $20,000 difference and there's a $20,000 add to reflect increased costs for those services.",223,,
991,0.97,5543.304,5557.818,So the number we have been presenting in that general fund balancing analysis was that net over all in total if you take all of the cuts and all of the adds it results in overall $27 million reduction.,223,,
992,0.97,5557.818,5561.923,I believe Council member Sawant's staff is looking at all of the cuts.,223,,
993,0.97,5561.923,5564.425,Some of which are actual cuts.,223,,
994,0.97,5564.425,5565.826,It is eliminating services.,223,,
995,0.97,5565.826,5569.096,It is reducing programs or services.,223,,
996,0.97,5569.096,5581.475,And some of it may be a transfer between departments or transfer of General fund support to--and then supported by a different funding source.,223,,
997,0.97,5581.475,5585.947,"So it is not a simple--a simple response, I understand.",223,,
998,0.97,5585.947,5595.089,"But I think both things are true if you look at all of just the cut items in the Mayor's proposed budget, it does look like there's about $200 million of cuts.",223,,
999,0.97,5595.089,5601.128,"But if you offset that with the transfers and that sort of thing, that's where we get to the net.",223,,
1000,0.97,5601.128,5602.964,Appreciate that clarification.,224,,
1001,0.97,5602.964,5604.865,"Council member Herbold, please go ahead.",224,,
1002,0.97,5604.865,5632.093,"Just as a follow-up, I mean if what we wanted to do was to restore funding for reduced services, the number that we're looking at City wide is the estimated central staff $27 million.",225,,
1003,0.97,5652.713,5661.422,It is a loss to the Department and gained to the Department but not necessarily the services.,226,,
1004,0.97,5661.422,5673.534,"We can work on trying to focus sort of what is entirely new spending, what is entirely an actual complete cut, like this thing will no longer happen to share with Council members.",226,,
1005,0.97,5673.534,5676.937,I don't have that number in front of us.,226,,
1006,0.97,5676.937,5679.206,It takes some sorting.,226,,
1007,0.97,5679.206,5681.575,Thank you very much.,227,,
1008,0.97,5681.575,5688.783,"Council member Sawant to close us out on this item, did you have a last comment there?",227,,
1009,0.97,5688.783,5689.016,Yes.,228,,
1010,0.97,5689.016,5703.23,I just want to preface what I'm about to say reiterating we will continue to discuss with central staff to revise and Fine-Tune the numbers.,228,,
1011,0.97,5703.23,5711.939,And I agree that sometimes the interpretation of the numbers is different.,228,,
1012,0.97,5711.939,5718.212,And I'm not--I accept central staff's interpretation may be different.,228,,
1013,0.97,5718.212,5731.725,"Just to clarify the numbers, if you do the subtraction of the 2020 parks budget and the difference between the 2020 parks budget and the 2021 parks budget, that is 35 million.",228,,
1014,0.97,5731.725,5746.006,"And then if you add to the 35 million the cost of living increases that have not--that are now removed, then it adds up to 41 million.",228,,
1015,0.97,5746.006,5749.777,"That is my understanding, which is what is cut from parks.",228,,
1016,0.97,5749.777,5757.118,It is not the services that are offset but take the cost of living adjustments.,228,,
1017,0.97,5757.118,5761.589,This idea we will continue to discuss with central staff.,228,,
1018,0.97,5761.589,5761.856,Yep.,229,,
1019,0.97,5761.856,5762.389,Happy to work but.,229,,
1020,0.97,5762.389,5765.526,That brings us to the end of the presentation.,229,,
1021,0.97,5765.526,5769.764,And as overview of the memo.,229,,
1022,0.97,5769.764,5772.867,I think this is a reminder where we are at.,229,,
1023,0.97,5772.867,5774.301,"Traci, anything else on this.",229,,
1024,0.97,5774.301,5774.568,Nope.,230,,
1025,0.97,5774.568,5776.67,I think we've quote it.,230,,
1026,0.97,5776.67,5777.238,Thanks so much.,230,,
1027,0.97,5777.238,5777.505,Okay.,231,,
1028,0.97,5777.505,5778.339,We appreciate your time.,231,,
1029,0.97,5778.339,5780.307,Thank you for walking us through this memo.,231,,
1030,0.97,5780.307,5787.515,We know there is much more to come here and appreciate the dialogue and interest in parks and recreation.,231,,
1031,0.97,5787.515,5787.948,Let's move on.,231,,
1032,0.97,5787.948,5789.984,I see Calvin up there.,231,,
1033,0.97,5789.984,5790.351,"Hello, Calvin.",231,,
1034,0.97,5790.351,5791.318,Thanks for joining us today.,231,,
1035,0.97,5791.318,5793.888,If you want to introduce yourself for the record.,231,,
1036,0.97,5793.888,5800.728,"And before you do that, Madam court, could you read item 2 in the record.",231,,
1037,0.97,5800.728,5804.031,"Agenda item 2. Seattle Department of transportation, briefing and discussion.",232,,
1038,0.97,5804.031,5812.84,"So on my agenda it says that we are going to do this at 11:05, which I'm really excited about.",233,,
1039,0.97,5812.84,5813.307,We're right on time.,233,,
1040,0.97,5813.307,5816.21,"Cal Vince, introduce yourself and take it away.",233,,
1041,0.97,5816.21,5819.947,I'm Calvin chow with central staff.,234,,
1042,0.97,5819.947,5824.852,I want to thank you Patty who is running the slides for us today.,234,,
1043,0.97,5824.852,5828.589,I have a fairly long memo attached to the agenda.,234,,
1044,0.97,5828.589,5832.493,Please feel free to stop me and pose my questions that you have as we go along.,234,,
1045,0.97,5832.493,5841.368,I will try to keep us going at a fairly high clip because we have a lot of material to cover.,234,,
1046,0.97,5841.368,5843.737,"Next slide, Patty.",234,,
1047,0.97,5843.737,5848.108,So our first couple slides just through the budget summary comparison table.,234,,
1048,0.97,5848.108,5854.682,I wanted to just take a moment to mention that this can be a little confusing.,234,,
1049,0.97,5854.682,5861.655,"So, for instance, this is showing the expenditures and the operating and capital portions of the budget.",234,,
1050,0.97,5861.655,5870.931,The operating sub total you will see goes down by about 18.3% from 2020 adopted to the 2021 proposed.,234,,
1051,0.97,5870.931,5882.476,But this is complicated by a couple of big swings in dollars that we will get into in the paper.,234,,
1052,0.97,5882.476,5898.993,"The most important ones are that the existing transit--Seattle transportation transit measure that expires this year generates about 66--$65 million, something like that, of funding for bus service in 2020.",234,,
1053,0.97,5898.993,5900.527,That measure expires in 2021.,234,,
1054,0.97,5900.527,5902.696,So it is not shown in this budget.,234,,
1055,0.97,5902.696,5905.899,That is one of the significant decreases.,234,,
1056,0.97,5905.899,5915.175,"And then in addition, this budget proposes to move the parking enforcement officers from SPD to Seattle Department transportation.",234,,
1057,0.97,5915.175,5917.678,So that is an increase of personnel and budget.,234,,
1058,0.97,5917.678,5927.054,"So if you take those items out, the actual operating expense is reduced by about 2.5% or so.",234,,
1059,0.97,5927.054,5935.029,"In the bottom section, the capital appropriations are also shown as being decreasing by about 17.3%.",234,,
1060,0.97,5935.029,5940.467,I think it is always important to remember that capital is spread over six years.,234,,
1061,0.97,5940.467,5946.073,So there is some--our CIP covers six years of spending.,234,,
1062,0.97,5946.073,5950.778,"There is natural variation from year to year, depending what the projects look like.",234,,
1063,0.97,5950.778,5957.651,This is a real reduction in the overall amount of capital spending for the next six years.,234,,
1064,0.97,5957.651,5966.994,It's--the specific numbers are driven somewhat by timing issues as well as that actual reduction in project spending over the next six years.,234,,
1065,0.97,5966.994,5968.796,"Next slide, please.",234,,
1066,0.97,5968.796,5971.398,Let's just pause real quick.,235,,
1067,0.97,5971.398,5975.002,"Are there any questions, folks, on that first slide?",235,,
1068,0.97,5975.002,5978.505,Maybe we can do them after the summary.,235,,
1069,0.97,5978.505,5981.709,The first two summarize the table on page 1 of the memo.,235,,
1070,0.97,5981.709,5981.909,Okay.,235,,
1071,0.97,5981.909,5983.677,"No questions at this mid point, Calvin.",235,,
1072,0.97,5983.677,5987.381,Let's see if there are after you go through this last part here.,235,,
1073,0.97,5987.381,5988.515,Thank you.,236,,
1074,0.97,5988.515,6000.861,This slide shows the total appropriations for the Department decreased by 17.7% between the adopted budget last year and this year's 2021 proposed budget.,236,,
1075,0.97,6000.861,6003.063,With the same Caveats I mentioned before.,236,,
1076,0.97,6003.063,6012.272,You can see the PEO officers reflected in the increase of total Ftes which is a 12.6% increase.,236,,
1077,0.97,6012.272,6021.715,The rest of the table includes the revenues and also includes fund balance that's are used to pay for these expenditures.,236,,
1078,0.97,6021.715,6025.786,It matches the total resource use drop 17.7%.,236,,
1079,0.97,6025.786,6039.666,Just want to highlight for folks that general fund is a small portion of the funding that goes to Sdot the rest of the resources are generally speaking transportation restricted funds.,236,,
1080,0.97,6039.666,6051.879,The department does get real estate excise tax which has some other use that's it can use for as well as Savant proceeds from the bond sale.,236,,
1081,0.97,6053.213,6055.382,"Next slide, please.",236,,
1082,0.97,6058.285,6062.156,So my paper goes through nine issues.,236,,
1083,0.97,6062.156,6066.093,And I'll try to cover them--we will see how quickly this goes.,236,,
1084,0.97,6066.093,6079.073,The first issue that I wanted to highlight is just the financial restraints that the Department faces in 2021.,236,,
1085,0.97,6079.073,6088.315,"In developing this proposal, Sdot identified $85 million less in 2021 than they had anticipated in last year's budget that.",236,,
1086,0.97,6088.315,6099.76,"Is a combination of reduced revenues in 2020, reduced revenues in 2021, and some unanticipated spending that happened in 2020 with the Covid response as well.",236,,
1087,0.97,6099.76,6116.743,"To respond to that, they have proposed a budget that reduces cost cutting by about $60 million and proposes a $25 million Interfund loan to cover 2021 operations.",236,,
1088,0.97,6116.743,6137.698,"That Interfund loan, it's--it is essentially trying to look at the expected recovery over the next four years and to count on that recovery so that we don't have to take deeper cuts in 2021 and then be forced to try to hire people back and get projects moving again.",236,,
1089,0.97,6137.698,6147.474,"The idea here is that by taking this loan, we can take a lesser cut and extend that over four years and have less disruption to services.",236,,
1090,0.97,6147.474,6151.678,So that is the broader context of how the budget is presented.,236,,
1091,0.97,6151.678,6156.917,My paper goes into a little more detail on just some of the specific revenue sources and the like.,236,,
1092,0.97,6156.917,6160.754,"But unless there are any questions, I would like to move on.",236,,
1093,0.97,6160.754,6163.023,Let me pause real quick.,237,,
1094,0.97,6163.023,6167.461,"Council members, any questions?",237,,
1095,0.97,6167.461,6167.794,Okay.,237,,
1096,0.97,6167.794,6168.462,Let's go ahead.,237,,
1097,0.97,6168.462,6170.264,"Next slide, please.",238,,
1098,0.97,6170.264,6180.707,"As part of the cost-cutting reductions in the budget, Sdot is proposing to AB Regate three positions and Defund another 30 positions.",238,,
1099,0.97,6180.707,6185.979,Nine of these positions are currently filled and would be subject to layoffs.,238,,
1100,0.97,6185.979,6202.596,I would highlight that the idea of Defunding positions but retaining the position authority is intended to help Sdot Rehire those positions when the economy recovers.,238,,
1101,0.97,6202.596,6204.231,That is leaving the executives with that authority.,238,,
1102,0.97,6204.231,6216.977,They would not necessarily have the budget to do so unless they got additional appropriate authority from the Council in a future time or if they reduced appropriations within those Dsls for other spending.,238,,
1103,0.97,6216.977,6229.656,"So as a consideration, you may want to consider reducing position authority to stay in line with the budget that is in front of you.",238,,
1104,0.97,6229.656,6231.124,Comments or questions?,239,,
1105,0.97,6231.124,6231.325,Okay.,239,,
1106,0.97,6231.325,6241.868,"Calvin, I see--in the memos that we have reviewed so far, it seems to be the Department that has taken the brunt of the Ftb reductions.",239,,
1107,0.97,6241.868,6242.235,Is that true.,239,,
1108,0.97,6242.235,6244.438,I think that is true.,240,,
1109,0.97,6244.438,6251.745,Aly may have a better sense of how it fits in with the overall city impact.,240,,
1110,0.97,6251.745,6256.55,But Sdot is taking a fairly significant cut.,240,,
1111,0.97,6256.55,6261.488,They have--it is 33 positions being cut.,240,,
1112,0.97,6261.488,6262.723,But nine of those are filled.,240,,
1113,0.97,6262.723,6266.36,And similar to the question that we asked last week.,241,,
1114,0.97,6266.36,6279.873,"Just want to sort of put this into context just on first blush, it looks like the Department is taking the highest amount of reductions overall.",241,,
1115,0.97,6279.873,6282.409,17.7% overall reduction in revenue.,241,,
1116,0.97,6282.409,6283.343,"Is that relatively high, Aly?",241,,
1117,0.97,6283.343,6287.514,I know we're waiting on that sort of macro analysis.,241,,
1118,0.97,6287.514,6287.948,Is that accurate?,241,,
1119,0.97,6287.948,6288.215,Yeah.,242,,
1120,0.97,6288.215,6290.584,I think that is all accurate.,242,,
1121,0.97,6290.584,6301.795,"I'm just doing--I double- checked to see if there are some other departments if you just look at the percent change numbers, you will see a higher percentage.",242,,
1122,0.97,6301.795,6307.434,"However, most of that is related to a difference between the 2020 adopted budget.",242,,
1123,0.97,6307.434,6328.455,"That Department had a lot of one-time adds or cuts versus looking at Sdot, which is more looking at Reducks in some of their I guess--more of their base services or programs and capital investments.",242,,
1124,0.97,6328.455,6328.855,Is that right.,242,,
1125,0.97,6328.855,6329.122,Yes.,243,,
1126,0.97,6329.122,6333.36,Maybe this is a line of questioning that you could follow up with after the meeting.,243,,
1127,0.97,6333.36,6333.727,No problem.,244,,
1128,0.97,6333.727,6334.161,That sounds good.,244,,
1129,0.97,6334.161,6336.63,Thank you very much.,244,,
1130,0.97,6336.63,6337.497,Let's go ahead.,245,,
1131,0.97,6337.497,6339.766,"Next slide, please.",246,,
1132,0.97,6380.54,6385.679,We will have local transportation funding over the next four years.,247,,
1133,0.97,6385.679,6395.455,"The CIP and the proposed budget identify a $60 million loss, there Abouts, of funding services that have been used to support move Seattle.",247,,
1134,0.97,6395.455,6397.691,The move Seattle levee is very consistent.,247,,
1135,0.97,6397.691,6400.527,It is property tax and it is consistent funding source.,247,,
1136,0.97,6400.527,6415.008,But it is really some of the other sources of funding like the special parking tax or the gas fuel tax revenues that have decreased.,247,,
1137,0.97,6415.008,6424.251,And sort of forced us to have less--less overall money for the suite of projects.,247,,
1138,0.97,6424.251,6435.262,So the proposed budget has significantly shifted dollars around for any number--for most of the move Seattle projects.,247,,
1139,0.97,6435.262,6447.674,And this has been a--where many of I think the Council members proposals that we will get to at the end of this presentation come into play.,247,,
1140,0.97,6447.674,6460.287,The move Seattle oversight committee has had a chance to review this and sent a letter with their recommendations on their issues as well I believe yesterday.,247,,
1141,0.97,6460.287,6478.772,"The main--I could go through a list of some of the specific reductions, but these include things like vision zero projects, projects like the Boulevard project and 23rd Avenue phase 3. there are sidewalk projects.",247,,
1142,0.97,6478.772,6483.21,"Grant Street station, contributions.",247,,
1143,0.97,6483.21,6488.281,Some other paving and arterial concrete paving projects that are delayed.,247,,
1144,0.97,6488.281,6503.93,"For a lot of the projects, they would be delayed past the expiration of move Seattle and would have to be considered in some future levee proposal or other funding source.",247,,
1145,0.97,6503.93,6507.267,I will get to this in the legislation section.,247,,
1146,0.97,6507.267,6510.871,But there are a couple of legislation items related to move Seattle.,247,,
1147,0.97,6510.871,6514.407,One has to do with the minimum general fund requirement.,247,,
1148,0.97,6514.407,6520.647,And the other has to do with some specific spending categories.,247,,
1149,0.97,6520.647,6527.22,And the split of levee dollars that would go into those.,247,,
1150,0.97,6527.22,6527.787,"Next slide, please.",247,,
1151,0.97,6527.787,6534.694,I have a quick question on number 3 here.,248,,
1152,0.97,6534.694,6545.005,"In the memo, page 6, middle of the Pang, you talk about how the move Seattle oversight committee received a briefing from Sdot on October 6th.",248,,
1153,0.97,6545.005,6552.212,And the oversight committee is going to be providing comments for our consideration during budget deliberations.,248,,
1154,0.97,6552.212,6555.148,"But we don't have those yet, right?",248,,
1155,0.97,6555.148,6558.718,When do we anticipate having recommendations back from the oversight committee?,248,,
1156,0.97,6558.718,6564.19,I believe I have seen an E-mail from them that I think went to Council Mens yesterday.,248,,
1157,0.97,6564.19,6568.295,I will make sure that it gets to everyone after the meeting.,248,,
1158,0.97,6568.295,6571.298,I believe they sent a Letterform alley to you.,248,,
1159,0.97,6571.298,6571.765,Okay.,249,,
1160,0.97,6571.765,6574.467,I see Council member Pedersen nodding.,249,,
1161,0.97,6574.467,6580.14,"As chair of transportation, you have received that as well Council member Pedersen.",249,,
1162,0.97,6580.14,6580.407,Yes.,250,,
1163,0.97,6580.407,6585.812,It was received yesterday morning.,250,,
1164,0.97,6585.812,6588.748,It is two pages long.,250,,
1165,0.97,6588.748,6597.29,"And it's fairly general in its request, in terms of the principles they lay out.",250,,
1166,0.97,6597.29,6601.795,And I can Recirculate that so it is more accessible for folks.,250,,
1167,0.97,6601.795,6603.763,That would be great.,251,,
1168,0.97,6603.763,6604.331,Thank you.,251,,
1169,0.97,6604.331,6623.65,"And I think the--the move Seattle program in general, even--regardless of the decisions that are made with this budget will continue to have to--will continue to oversee the levee implementation for the next four years as well.",252,,
1170,0.97,6623.65,6626.886,So this is really their review of the proposal in front of us.,252,,
1171,0.97,6626.886,6634.06,That they will continue to review this until the conclusion of the levee.,252,,
1172,0.97,6634.06,6634.561,Great.,253,,
1173,0.97,6634.561,6635.261,"Thank you, Calvin.",253,,
1174,0.97,6635.261,6637.297,Let's go ahead.,253,,
1175,0.97,6637.297,6639.432,"Next slide, please.",254,,
1176,0.97,6639.432,6648.208,The West Seattle bridge as everyone I'm sure is familiar was closed in 2020 due to observed cracks in the main of the bridge.,254,,
1177,0.97,6648.208,6656.316,We expect the Mayor to announce a preferred alternative for whether we repair or replace that structure later this year.,254,,
1178,0.97,6656.316,6662.055,So that is still a conversation that is--has a lot of unknowns and is still in front of us.,254,,
1179,0.97,6662.055,6673.6,I wanted to make sure that Council is aware of the budget actions that you have approved and the budget actions that are included in this budget proposal.,254,,
1180,0.97,6673.6,6678.505,"Earlier this summer, you did improve $70 million for this project.",254,,
1181,0.97,6678.505,6684.711,That included an inner fund loan to be made to Sdot now.,254,,
1182,0.97,6684.711,6693.119,The 2021 proposed budget would essentially pay back that loan and also add an additional $30 million in 2021.,254,,
1183,0.97,6693.119,6699.225,It would do this through a bond sale.,254,,
1184,0.97,6699.225,6702.128,Our general government bond sale.,254,,
1185,0.97,6702.128,6711.905,So this would be essentially pledging future Reit to support the--to support this project in the future.,254,,
1186,0.97,6711.905,6714.641,This pays back the inner fund loan in its entirety.,254,,
1187,0.97,6714.641,6724.684,And the total amount that would be authorized for 2020-2021 and any carry-forward would be $100 million with the proposed budget.,254,,
1188,0.97,6726.186,6734.26,I know we have some issue identification that correspond to the nine item that's Calvin is walking through.,255,,
1189,0.97,6734.26,6748.374,"If you don't mind, I would love to try to hold those for the end to get an overview of the issues and go through each one of the identification sheets as we get into that part of the memo.",255,,
1190,0.97,6748.374,6748.641,Okay.,256,,
1191,0.97,6748.641,6749.876,"Council member Herbold, question?",257,,
1192,0.97,6749.876,6750.11,Yes.,258,,
1193,0.97,6750.11,6756.282,On that direction I will not say anything about budget action proposal number 3 with my name on it.,258,,
1194,0.97,6756.282,6762.188,I do have a question about the option a identified by Calvin.,258,,
1195,0.97,6762.188,6771.464,Is there--is there funding in the 2021 budget for Council consultant services?,258,,
1196,0.97,6771.464,6778.705,I will have to do a little more research to figure out how much money there is in that proposal.,259,,
1197,0.97,6778.705,6780.306,I'm afraid I don't have that information here.,259,,
1198,0.97,6780.306,6796.656,Just as a point of information for colleagues on the Council we do have an independent consultant that has been advising us.,260,,
1199,0.97,6796.656,6800.226,"Brought that team on just a couple months ago, I think.",260,,
1200,0.97,6800.226,6800.96,"Is that right, Calvin?",260,,
1201,0.97,6800.96,6802.228,About two months ago.,260,,
1202,0.97,6802.228,6804.23,About two months ago.,261,,
1203,0.97,6804.23,6813.64,And they helped provide some structural engineering support for us as we review the executive proposals for the West Seattle bridge.,261,,
1204,0.97,6813.64,6815.775,I appreciate you flagging it.,262,,
1205,0.97,6815.775,6820.78,It might be a useful function to carry over into 2021 as well.,262,,
1206,0.97,6857.417,6865.825,I expect it to happen early November.,263,,
1207,0.97,6865.825,6871.664,"That might be illustrative in myself that our expectations are different, me and Calvin.",263,,
1208,0.97,6871.664,6878.471,It wasn't originally intended to be October 21st.,263,,
1209,0.97,6878.471,6908.301,"And the Mayor and Sdot has recently indicated just in the last week or so that they're going to wait until the community Stakeholder group, the West Seattle advisory task force or community task force, they have an opportunity to review the materials that they have--that Sdot has released in the SBA, the cost benefit analysis.",263,,
1210,0.97,6908.301,6933.826,So the executive didn't feel that it would be right to make an announcement about a preferred alternative before having an opportunity for our Stakeholders who are advising the Mayor to review the materials before giving their sort of advisory input to the Mayor as part of the Decision- making.,263,,
1211,0.97,6933.826,6938.665,I think this is an issue that there is a lot of information.,264,,
1212,0.97,6938.665,6944.27,It may be one that would be good for a Council briefing shortly.,264,,
1213,0.97,6944.27,6946.005,I see heads nodding.,265,,
1214,0.97,6946.005,6946.205,Okay.,265,,
1215,0.97,6946.205,6949.776,Thank you so much for flagging that.,265,,
1216,0.97,6949.776,6950.81,Let's move on.,265,,
1217,0.97,6950.81,6956.683,"Next slide, please.",266,,
1218,0.97,6956.683,6962.088,This identifies the transfer from SPD to Sdot.,266,,
1219,0.97,6962.088,6967.794,It would consolidate within the Sdot Right-Of-Way management.,266,,
1220,0.97,6967.794,6968.795,That consolidates those functions.,266,,
1221,0.97,6968.795,6983.609,"In addition to the personnel and the budget for that personnel, the proposal also includes $800,000 to cover the overtime associated with special events.",266,,
1222,0.97,6983.609,6997.724,"The--there is one small--if you look at the decrease in the Sdot--excuse me, the police Department budget and the increasing Sdot budget, the police officers move in their entirety.",266,,
1223,0.97,6997.724,7002.662,But the back office support has a bit of a difference.,266,,
1224,0.97,7002.662,7015.108,The Sdot has identified I believe three positions that are necessary to help provide the back office support that SPD provide when that unit was there.,266,,
1225,0.97,7015.108,7019.579,And so SPD is eliminating those positions in the SPD budget.,266,,
1226,0.97,7019.579,7027.053,And Sdot is asking for new positions to support that.,266,,
1227,0.97,7027.053,7033.259,I will Noet that Council member Herbold has proposal number 4 when we get to that.,267,,
1228,0.97,7033.259,7036.462,Are there any questions on this piece?,267,,
1229,0.97,7036.462,7037.497,Not seeing any questions.,267,,
1230,0.97,7037.497,7041.934,Thank you for Previewing the discussion to come on that form a.,267,,
1231,0.97,7041.934,7044.303,"Next slide, please.",268,,
1232,0.97,7045.371,7053.646,So the next slide is relating to the sale transportation and the transit measures as I mentioned at the beginning.,269,,
1233,0.97,7053.646,7058.151,The existing 2014 transit measure will expire at the end of this year.,269,,
1234,0.97,7058.151,7064.056,And so the proposed budget eliminates that funding from the 2021 budget.,269,,
1235,0.97,7064.056,7070.563,"Earlier this summer, council placed a replacement transit measure on the November ballot that.",269,,
1236,0.97,7070.563,7071.197,Is currently before voters.,269,,
1237,0.97,7071.197,7078.371,Just wanted to highlight that you don't see either of these dollars Referenced in the budget.,269,,
1238,0.97,7078.371,7089.916,"Depending on voter approval, if that comes to pass, then I will work with the executive to prepare budget amendments necessary for including it in the budget.",269,,
1239,0.97,7091.117,7098.891,This was a piece of good news for our budget here.,270,,
1240,0.97,7098.891,7099.425,Welcome news in 2020.,270,,
1241,0.97,7099.425,7103.429,Additional comments on this?,270,,
1242,0.97,7103.429,7103.663,Okay.,270,,
1243,0.97,7103.663,7106.499,Next item please.,271,,
1244,0.97,7106.499,7116.309,So last week the Washington Supreme Court struck down initiative 976 which would have eliminated our ability to collect vehicle license fees.,271,,
1245,0.97,7116.309,7131.357,Those vehicle license fees are a significant portion of what we collect for the transit measure as well as some basic infrastructure and maintenance funding that was imposed.,271,,
1246,0.97,7131.357,7144.07,"With initiative 976 struck down, the Council and the city does have the ability to consider raising additional vehicle license fees, either through Council action or through future voter approval.",271,,
1247,0.97,7144.07,7147.573,I just wanted to highlight this is an opportunity for you.,271,,
1248,0.97,7147.573,7155.214,You can consider it as part of this budget or we could take it up immediately following the 2021 budget as well.,271,,
1249,0.97,7157.917,7165.892,"Council member Lewis, please go ahead.",272,,
1250,0.97,7165.892,7166.125,No.,273,,
1251,0.97,7166.125,7166.292,No.,273,,
1252,0.97,7166.292,7168.594,I muted you.,274,,
1253,0.97,7168.594,7168.828,No.,275,,
1254,0.97,7168.828,7169.662,I muted.,275,,
1255,0.97,7169.662,7173.132,"Calvin, can I ask a question here?",275,,
1256,0.97,7173.132,7191.784,"I know that we have now unlocked the ability to do the Council approved increase, which would be an additional $20 on top of the $20 that has already been assessed.",275,,
1257,0.97,7191.784,7220.246,"In terms of the tabs that we were not able to go to the voters with in the measure that is going to be--well, that is on the ballot right now, what could the Timeline be on us going back to the voters or as I understand it the $60 car Tabatha we're authorized to pursue under the transportation benefit district.",275,,
1258,0.97,7220.246,7220.479,I mean?,275,,
1259,0.97,7220.479,7239.565,We made the really difficult decision of increasing an incredibly Regressive sales tax to offset the horrible hit that the initiative rightfully determined to be blatantly unconstitutional by the court took that big hit.,275,,
1260,0.97,7239.565,7268.394,"And now that that is gone, I would like us to maybe at the very least discuss a potential path forward on what some of the strategies ongoing back to the voters might look like to restore the voter approved car tab element as well, which, you know, is different from I understand it our Council authority which is limited to the $20.",275,,
1261,0.97,7268.394,7283.843,I want you to talk about how we may be able to pursue a transportation benefit district and what kind of the Timeline would be on that given that we have a measure on the ballot already and the awkward timing of the court case.,275,,
1262,0.97,7283.843,7295.688,"Because we have a ballot measure before voters right now, I feel the need to be a little bit--I don't want to speak too much for a measure that is currently in front of voters.",276,,
1263,0.97,7295.688,7300.76,So I will stay to the highlights in my response.,276,,
1264,0.97,7300.76,7309.568,But my--I believe that this is a separate funding proposal from--let me step back.,276,,
1265,0.97,7309.568,7318.577,The measure that Council approved this summer is a 0.15% sales tax.,276,,
1266,0.97,7318.577,7320.946,A separate funding source from the licensing fee.,276,,
1267,0.97,7320.946,7326.886,Council could propose going to voters with a separate vehicle license fee measure.,276,,
1268,0.97,7326.886,7343.035,And I believe the time restrictions are going to be based on when it can get in front of--which election we could get a ballot measure to King County elections in time to meet.,276,,
1269,0.97,7343.035,7347.707,And are not tied to any of the other measures in front of voters.,276,,
1270,0.97,7357.183,7358.451,That's good enough for now.,277,,
1271,0.97,7358.451,7363.255,Given that we are in the middle of an election right now.,277,,
1272,0.97,7363.255,7369.628,I appreciate that answer and we will definitely dive into this more.,277,,
1273,0.97,7369.628,7377.87,I appreciate you clarifying and providing your technical view of where we stand.,277,,
1274,0.97,7377.87,7383.709,Hopefully soon in November we will have the outcome of that measure and figure out what the course of action may be.,278,,
1275,0.97,7383.709,7386.679,Any other comments on this item?,279,,
1276,0.97,7386.679,7389.415,Okay.,279,,
1277,0.97,7389.415,7391.384,"Seeing none, thank you.",279,,
1278,0.97,7391.384,7393.753,Next item please.,280,,
1279,0.97,7393.753,7402.061,So like many of the transit service in Seattle with the Covid response we saw a decrease in transit demand.,280,,
1280,0.97,7402.061,7414.573,And so Sdot actually reduced the existing Street car rider--reduced it from 10% from the Pre-Covid levels.,280,,
1281,0.97,7414.573,7429.054,"The 2021 budget would also reduce that Street car service, would maintain that cut and use that as an operational savings of about $700,000.",280,,
1282,0.97,7429.054,7437.596,The budget did have some increases in the operating costs that are related to escalate of costs that eats up a lot of those savings.,280,,
1283,0.97,7437.596,7445.137,So it is not as much of an overall net savings as it could be.,280,,
1284,0.97,7445.137,7454.48,But you could consider further reductions in terms of frequency or span of service that may provide additional cut costing there.,280,,
1285,0.97,7454.48,7457.817,And I see I skipped over a point here.,280,,
1286,0.97,7457.817,7465.357,"Just to highlight that last year--or earlier this year, Sdot paused all work on the street car indefinitely.",280,,
1287,0.97,7465.357,7470.229,So that project has been essentially Defunded in the CIP.,280,,
1288,0.97,7472.998,7475.968,"Questions, colleagues?",281,,
1289,0.97,7475.968,7478.137,Council member Pedersen please go ahead.,281,,
1290,0.97,7478.137,7481.106,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",282,,
1291,0.97,7481.106,7490.649,"Calvin, I'm interested in this option A. consider further reduction of Street car hours, particularly the one in South Lake Union.",282,,
1292,0.97,7490.649,7499.825,If employees are not returning to on-site work quickly in the first and second quarters of next year or until there is a vaccine in place.,282,,
1293,0.97,7499.825,7503.929,And soy don't know how easy it is for you to quantify this.,282,,
1294,0.97,7503.929,7520.112,"But I would be interested in seeing what options there might be for the South Lake Union Street car reduction, further reductions as suggested here by option a, whether there's a simple way to, whether it is reducing another 10%.",282,,
1295,0.97,7520.112,7531.123,"If so, would that enable us to redeploy some of these requests being made by my colleagues to add to programs and projects?",282,,
1296,0.97,7531.123,7537.229,And I'll be happy to follow up with the Department to try to get some options in front of you.,283,,
1297,0.97,7537.229,7550.309,"I think just from my take on it, without knowing exactly how it might affect the rest of the operations, it seems like 10% does relate to about $700,000.",283,,
1298,0.97,7558.017,7558.417,Thank you.,284,,
1299,0.97,7558.417,7562.821,I have a quick question about the street car overall.,284,,
1300,0.97,7562.821,7565.791,"Council President, please go ahead.",284,,
1301,0.97,7565.791,7567.359,Thank you.,285,,
1302,0.97,7567.359,7582.207,"In terms of the option a here and as a follow-up to Council member Pedersen's inquiry, I see from your memo on the--on the budget summary document chart, I should say.",285,,
1303,0.97,7582.207,7585.945,So it does list South Lake Union Street car operations.,285,,
1304,0.97,7585.945,7591.417,It says that there is a proposed 3% reduction.,285,,
1305,0.97,7591.417,7620.446,"And I guess I want to get a sense of what you know, Calvin, about what the executive and the Department Acum sod in terms of how that 3% proposed reductions in the 3% reduction before us.",285,,
1306,0.97,7620.446,7626.285,The 3% reduction of expenditures isn't necessarily a reduction in service.,286,,
1307,0.97,7626.285,7635.127,So Sdot reported that they have reduced service hours in total by about 10% across the lines.,286,,
1308,0.97,7635.127,7645.671,So I will have to get some more information from them about how that has been implemented or proposed to be implemented for 2021.,286,,
1309,0.97,7645.671,7657.049,The savings that were related to that cut were mostly offset by the assumed escalation.,286,,
1310,0.97,7657.049,7662.354,Part of it is our contract with King County Metro for operating the street car.,286,,
1311,0.97,7662.354,7679.271,"So in total, even though it is 10% cut in service, it only shows as this 3% reduction in the South Lake Union expenditures and 8.5% increase in the operations.",286,,
1312,0.97,7679.271,7679.938,Okay.,287,,
1313,0.97,7679.938,7692.551,So it would be helpful to know more about that 3% and what it is actually--where those cost savings are being found in terms of the 3% listed on your chart.,287,,
1314,0.97,7692.551,7693.485,And then the overall 10%.,287,,
1315,0.97,7693.485,7701.093,"I guess I'm hearing from you that as far as you know, it doesn't impact frequency or hours of service.",287,,
1316,0.97,7701.093,7701.427,It will.,288,,
1317,0.97,7701.427,7706.632,So it is--I will have to get back to you about exactly how it has been implemented.,288,,
1318,0.97,7706.632,7712.604,It is a 10% reduction in the total amount of transit service hours that street cars are operating.,288,,
1319,0.97,7712.604,7719.511,"Whether they have taken that in longer frequency times or in shortening the span of service, I don't have that information handy.",288,,
1320,0.97,7719.511,7724.316,But I will be happy to follow up and get that information for you.,288,,
1321,0.97,7724.316,7725.25,Okay.,289,,
1322,0.97,7725.25,7733.292,"And that 10% reduction, the broader 10% reduction, that's across the street car network.",289,,
1323,0.97,7733.292,7739.331,"Presumably, you know, tell me if I'm wrong here.",289,,
1324,0.97,7739.331,7747.506,But presumably to allow the flexibility of sort of shifting hours of service and frequency across the system.,289,,
1325,0.97,7747.506,7758.884,To allow for flexibility as opposed to--as opposed to focusing on one line versus the other.,289,,
1326,0.97,7758.884,7764.156,"Well, the budget establishes separate Esls for those lines.",290,,
1327,0.97,7764.156,7768.727,There is implicit--those are reserves of the street cars.,290,,
1328,0.97,7768.727,7774.867,I just have to follow up with being implemented for each s line.,290,,
1329,0.97,7774.867,7778.837,I just don't know at this time.,290,,
1330,0.97,7778.837,7779.204,Okay.,291,,
1331,0.97,7779.204,7784.743,"And in terms of option a, that would be helpful information to give follow-up.",291,,
1332,0.97,7784.743,7799.091,Just generally I'll say that I want to be thoughtful about--about any sort of proposed further reductions to frequency in hours of service.,291,,
1333,0.97,7799.091,7811.236,"In large part because I think if the cut is too deep, then we're essentially signaling that we're abandoning the street car system in its entirety.",291,,
1334,0.97,7811.236,7817.943,And so I would be interested in Council central staff's analysis of where that tipping point might be.,291,,
1335,0.97,7817.943,7822.147,And that might not be a very easy analysis.,291,,
1336,0.97,7822.147,7828.053,"But Calvin, I have a huge amount of confidence in your ability to shepherd us through that analysis.",291,,
1337,0.97,7828.053,7862.287,"That is what I'm considering, sort of when we start digging into the frequency and hours of service in this particular space, I'm a little worried that we're going to--particularly on two lines that have already been built and are existing infrastructure in our city, I worry about whether we're setting them up for future failure and not being able to recover the level of service and frequency in the sort of outward years.",291,,
1338,0.97,7862.287,7875.734,And of course we don't know what 2021 will bring us to in terms of the safe start order that the governor is looking at and has looked at.,291,,
1339,0.97,7875.734,7889.381,"And what, you know, our employers downtown employers are going to do in terms of an entire 12 months of planning related to Telework or hybrid of Telework and on-site.",291,,
1340,0.97,7889.381,7911.703,I mean there are so many variables there that I want to make sure that we are being careful about any further proposed reductions that would impact frequency in hours of service and the long-term viability of transit infrastructure that has been built and we have invested millions of dollars in to help keep it successful.,291,,
1341,0.97,7911.703,7918.71,So I just want to put a plug in and a request for some further analysis on that point.,291,,
1342,0.97,7918.71,7919.077,Absolutely.,292,,
1343,0.97,7919.077,7925.25,"And I think Council member, you're absolutely right.",292,,
1344,0.97,7925.25,7933.992,We're all unsure what 2021 will bring and what that means for transit in general around the region.,292,,
1345,0.97,7933.992,7936.461,The proposal is a 10% reduction one time.,292,,
1346,0.97,7936.461,7938.297,It is a continuation of our Covid response piece.,292,,
1347,0.97,7938.297,7944.936,I think the option in front of you is whether there is additional opportunity there.,292,,
1348,0.97,7944.936,7961.82,I would recommend that any redirection of funding be considered one time and not for any ongoing use for exactly that reason because we don't know what the long-term forecast for Street car Ridership will be.,292,,
1349,0.97,7961.82,7981.673,"And as a follow-up to that particular point, there is always the possibility of Council looking at the question of frequency in hours of service, either or, in the 2021 supplemental budget process.",293,,
1350,0.97,7981.673,7998.023,We're not restricted from receiving additional information as 2021 evolves in capturing additional savings based on Ridership data and Teleworking or on-site trends that we're beginning to see.,293,,
1351,0.97,7998.023,7999.658,Is that fair to say.,293,,
1352,0.97,7999.658,8001.093,That is correct.,294,,
1353,0.97,8001.093,8005.43,Some of that could be done administratively.,294,,
1354,0.97,8005.43,8010.068,The budget sort of lists that maximum that the executive can spend for this.,294,,
1355,0.97,8010.068,8017.609,So additional cost savings could be done even without budget action in the future.,294,,
1356,0.97,8017.609,8023.515,Maybe warranted depending on how--how Sdot operates the system.,294,,
1357,0.97,8023.515,8028.754,"So they can always spend less, but they can't spend more.",294,,
1358,0.97,8028.754,8029.554,Got it.,295,,
1359,0.97,8029.554,8030.555,Fair enough.,295,,
1360,0.97,8030.555,8031.556,"Thank you, Calvin.",295,,
1361,0.97,8031.556,8033.258,"And thank you, Madam chair.",295,,
1362,0.97,8033.258,8035.56,"Thank you, Council President.",296,,
1363,0.97,8035.56,8040.766,"Any additional questions on this item number 8? Calvin, one question that I have.",296,,
1364,0.97,8040.766,8042.534,Actually it is two fold.,296,,
1365,0.97,8042.534,8053.245,"One, is there any Federal penalty for the city of Seattle not moving forward with the street car.",296,,
1366,0.97,8053.245,8056.548,Congressional members advocated hard to make sure that we got the millions needed.,296,,
1367,0.97,8056.548,8072.898,Do we have to pay that back or is there any penalty with that moving forward?,296,,
1368,0.97,8074.232,8079.538,My understanding we have not received Federal money for the street car project.,297,,
1369,0.97,8079.538,8085.01,But there have been expenses that have been spent in anticipation of that funding.,297,,
1370,0.97,8085.01,8090.849,So I'm still checking to make sure that there are no outstanding liabilities.,297,,
1371,0.97,8090.849,8104.029,"Earlier this summer when we did the 2020 rebalancing, council redirected the money that was set aside for this project, there was $9 million of Mercer MEGA block proceeds.",297,,
1372,0.97,8104.029,8106.731,A million of it had already been spent.,297,,
1373,0.97,8106.731,8111.97,8Million of it was directed to other transportation priorities.,297,,
1374,0.97,8111.97,8117.542,At this time I don't believe there is any remaining liability but I'm checking with the executive.,297,,
1375,0.97,8117.542,8134.126,I think that is an important clarification as well to put into context with the second part of the chart that you offered on page one of your memo and slide number two in your presentation.,298,,
1376,0.97,8134.126,8145.737,"At first glance if you just look at the street car line item, it looks as if there is a minor reintroduction 6%.",298,,
1377,0.97,8145.737,8149.574,We have to take that into the overall reduction.,298,,
1378,0.97,8149.574,8151.409,It is helpful.,298,,
1379,0.97,8151.409,8154.88,I remain concerned about Sdot moving forward with the Connector.,298,,
1380,0.97,8154.88,8168.96,"And I understand as well though that we are in tough times and we're making really tough Deisions about whether or not people have the services that they need for basic life necessities, food and housing and other service.",298,,
1381,0.97,8168.96,8169.694,I fully get that.,298,,
1382,0.97,8169.694,8180.071,"I want to make sure if there are any penalties, that is helpful to know.",298,,
1383,0.97,8180.071,8180.272,Okay.,298,,
1384,0.97,8180.272,8180.605,Le's move on.,298,,
1385,0.97,8180.605,8182.274,Last item on your sheet here.,298,,
1386,0.97,8182.274,8185.343,Last item is the waterfront.,299,,
1387,0.97,8185.343,8187.946,And my colleague will be covering that item.,299,,
1388,0.97,8190.615,8191.316,Hi.,300,,
1389,0.97,8191.316,8196.188,Checking that I'm visible and audible.,300,,
1390,0.97,8196.188,8196.555,You are.,301,,
1391,0.97,8196.555,8197.088,Fantastic.,302,,
1392,0.97,8197.088,8197.289,Yep.,302,,
1393,0.97,8197.289,8197.722,I'm Eric.,302,,
1394,0.97,8197.722,8198.523,I work for central staff.,302,,
1395,0.97,8198.523,8208.333,Wanted to take a moment to note that the proposed CIP delayed spending on the waterfront maintains that project schedule completion in 2024.,302,,
1396,0.97,8208.333,8209.901,And the overall spending.,302,,
1397,0.97,8209.901,8215.574,There is some additional money coming from Wsdot for the bridge project.,302,,
1398,0.97,8215.574,8221.346,"That is about $500,000--it is actually $500,000 in 2021.",302,,
1399,0.97,8221.346,8225.817,And a total of $8.5 million over the course of that project for the next few years.,302,,
1400,0.97,8225.817,8228.853,There is an add there.,302,,
1401,0.97,8228.853,8231.122,That is Reimbursable dollars from Wash-Dot.,302,,
1402,0.97,8231.122,8233.925,It adds a new maintenance project.,302,,
1403,0.97,8233.925,8238.597,That is to maintain the new waterfront project assets.,302,,
1404,0.97,8238.597,8240.398,The infrastructure being built.,302,,
1405,0.97,8240.398,8243.435,"Next year that is $100,000 and increases in the Outyears.",302,,
1406,0.97,8243.435,8245.77,I don't have any issues to flag for you.,302,,
1407,0.97,8245.77,8247.272,I just wanted to provide context.,302,,
1408,0.97,8247.272,8249.674,That rounds out the slide for me.,302,,
1409,0.97,8249.674,8252.577,But I'm happy to take questions.,302,,
1410,0.97,8252.577,8253.044,All right.,303,,
1411,0.97,8253.044,8259.017,"Council colleagues, any questions on this, page 11 of the memo?",303,,
1412,0.97,8259.017,8259.284,Okay.,303,,
1413,0.97,8259.284,8261.086,I am not seeing any questions.,303,,
1414,0.97,8261.086,8262.587,"Thank you, Eric, for joining us.",303,,
1415,0.97,8262.587,8263.655,Of course.,304,,
1416,0.97,8263.655,8264.189,Thank you.,304,,
1417,0.97,8264.189,8268.526,Now we're into budget legislation.,305,,
1418,0.97,8268.526,8274.833,Then we will go to Council members form as.,305,,
1419,0.97,8363.722,8366.691,And is that is included in their letter to you.,306,,
1420,0.97,8366.691,8376.201,And thanks to Council member Pedersen who circulated the letter to all of our offices.,307,,
1421,0.97,8376.201,8376.701,11:26.,307,,
1422,0.97,8376.701,8376.935,11:23.,307,,
1423,0.97,8376.935,8379.304,Thank you Council member Pedersen.,307,,
1424,0.97,8379.304,8381.206,"Next slide, please.",308,,
1425,0.97,8381.206,8386.344,Also related to move Seattle is the minimum general fund requirement.,309,,
1426,0.97,8386.344,8397.956,So the move Seattle levee does require that a minimum of $40 million which is escalated for general fund be able to collect levee funding.,309,,
1427,0.97,8397.956,8409.234,You can suspend this by Council ordinance with a finding that financial or economic conditions prohibit us from doing so.,309,,
1428,0.97,8409.234,8412.237,The escalation would be about $45 million.,309,,
1429,0.97,8412.237,8428.353,"If you take out the parking enforcement officers, which is of course general funded, you would have about $42.8 million of General fund in Sdot's budget.",309,,
1430,0.97,8428.353,8435.493,The propose the legislation acknowledges this was not a consideration when the voters approved move Seattle.,309,,
1431,0.97,8435.493,8446.171,"Even though we technically meet the threshold, this would then authorize the minimal spending requirement.",309,,
1432,0.97,8446.171,8449.707,You took a similar action earlier this summer for 2020.,309,,
1433,0.97,8449.707,8450.008,Great.,310,,
1434,0.97,8450.008,8453.244,I see no questions on this item.,310,,
1435,0.97,8453.244,8453.678,Okay.,311,,
1436,0.97,8453.678,8458.316,The next item is our last piece of budget legislation.,311,,
1437,0.97,8458.316,8461.786,It would authorize a $25 million inner fund loan from the housing incentive Fund.,311,,
1438,0.97,8461.786,8464.522,This loan would be short term.,311,,
1439,0.97,8464.522,8469.994,"It would be repaid by December 31st, 2024.",311,,
1440,0.97,8469.994,8481.306,"This loan unlike other loans which are often for a specific revenue source or for specific purposes, this supports Sdot's general operations and is used to balance their budgetary ducks over the next four years.",311,,
1441,0.97,8481.306,8491.115,And we have confirmed that the housing central fund has sufficient resources to offer the loan.,311,,
1442,0.97,8491.115,8493.551,"Calvin--Oh, council member Pedersen.",312,,
1443,0.97,8493.551,8495.386,I'll call on you in a second.,312,,
1444,0.97,8495.386,8499.023,I want to provide a quick update.,312,,
1445,0.97,8499.023,8523.147,I understand that the city's budget office has heard some of our concerns about using the funding even though there is sufficient funding in their many projects in the pipeline are able to leverage additional funding by recognizing there is future dollars coming our way and we don't want to put at risk or jeopardy the housing efforts.,312,,
1446,0.97,8523.147,8527.552,I understand that they are contemplating a different fund source for that inner fund loan.,312,,
1447,0.97,8527.552,8528.753,Do you have any updates on that.,312,,
1448,0.97,8528.753,8531.155,I do not have any updates.,313,,
1449,0.97,8531.155,8534.025,I will be happy to follow up with them.,313,,
1450,0.97,8534.025,8534.292,Okay.,314,,
1451,0.97,8534.292,8542.267,I will NOTE there we may have options C or more pending the information that is coming from the CBO.,314,,
1452,0.97,8542.267,8547.272,Given the concerns that they heard about the Oh revenue stream.,314,,
1453,0.97,8547.272,8548.64,Council member Pedersen please go ahead.,314,,
1454,0.97,8548.64,8550.575,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",315,,
1455,0.97,8550.575,8569.46,"I wanted to note on page 2 of the letter that we received from the move Seattle levee oversight committee, they do support using an inner fund loan to help fill the gap, so to speak, of the budget shortfalls for the transportation project.",315,,
1456,0.97,8576.601,8579.671,"Thank you, council member.",316,,
1457,0.97,8579.671,8582.006,Other questions on this item?,316,,
1458,0.97,8582.006,8585.81,"Calvin, I think we got through it all.",316,,
1459,0.97,8585.81,8587.679,Now to the really fun part.,316,,
1460,0.97,8587.679,8587.979,All right.,316,,
1461,0.97,8587.979,8596.254,We know we have many form a's that were corresponding with some of the conversation that we had.,316,,
1462,0.97,8596.254,8600.058,Some Council members have identified areas of interest.,316,,
1463,0.97,8600.058,8600.391,Overan hour.,316,,
1464,0.97,8600.391,8603.261,I think we have plenty of time.,316,,
1465,0.97,8603.261,8609.667,"Again, please keep the comments relatively brief and we want to make sure that folks still have time for questions.",316,,
1466,0.97,8609.667,8610.401,Please go ahead.,316,,
1467,0.97,8610.401,8610.668,Sure.,317,,
1468,0.97,8610.668,8618.343,And I will do a brief introduction and hand it over to the council member who sponsors the proposal to speak to it.,317,,
1469,0.97,8618.343,8623.815,Number one is from Council member Herbold.,317,,
1470,0.97,8623.815,8627.018,Reprioritize spending from Sdot program to reserve funding for the project.,317,,
1471,0.97,8627.018,8636.394,This was a project included in the levee but that's been delayed by the sound transit light rail project.,317,,
1472,0.97,8636.394,8637.762,Council member Herbold.,318,,
1473,0.97,8637.762,8640.865,Thank you so much.,319,,
1474,0.97,8640.865,8651.943,"As Calvin be mentioned, full funding for this project was included in the move Seattle levee passed by the voters in 2016.",319,,
1475,0.97,8651.943,8654.879,100% design was reached in fall of 2017.,319,,
1476,0.97,8654.879,8658.85,Just asking my colleagues to sit with that for a second.,319,,
1477,0.97,8658.85,8666.457,Full funding for this entire project was included in the move levee.,319,,
1478,0.97,8666.457,8672.296,That is an exceptional promise to the constituents in this community.,319,,
1479,0.97,8672.296,8677.402,And it is a Testament to the need for the work.,319,,
1480,0.97,8677.402,8698.956,"After passage of the levee, Sdot worked with the community and spent the funds necessary to reach full design.",319,,
1481,0.97,8698.956,8699.891,100% design.,319,,
1482,0.97,8699.891,8702.16,We delayed with community Begrudging acceptance.,319,,
1483,0.97,8702.16,8706.831,And other folks in the community full heartedly supporting.,319,,
1484,0.97,8706.831,8708.933,We delayed implementation of that project.,319,,
1485,0.97,8708.933,8710.635,I supported that decision.,319,,
1486,0.97,8710.635,8723.047,The reason why we hit pause was because the project overlaps with one of the options under construction--under consideration for sound transit's light rail project.,319,,
1487,0.97,8723.047,8739.03,"So the decision was made to delay implementation until completion of sound transit's Esi process, expected to be completed in 2022.",319,,
1488,0.97,8739.03,8748.139,Timing for the 2020 to 2025Cip listing was not practical due to potential conflict with potential alignment for the sound transit light rail.,319,,
1489,0.97,8748.139,8758.082,And I think it is really important to amend the CIP to add funding back in for 2023 and 2024.,319,,
1490,0.97,8758.082,8775.733,"I just want to--as recently as November 1ST, 2019, Sdot made a strong commitment about what the delay on the implementation of the project meant and what it doesn't mean.",319,,
1491,0.97,8775.733,8788.279,"They made the commitment--again, this was a commitment that Sdot made to the community to get their agreement in principle to delay implementation of the project.",319,,
1492,0.97,8788.279,8805.296,"I think it is a really, really critically important that we--that we recognize the--the role that these kinds of commitments play in getting community support for voter approved levees.",319,,
1493,0.97,8816.04,8823.648,"If sound transit for West Seattle does not impact way, we will move forward with the full project as designed.",319,,
1494,0.97,8823.648,8836.194,"If sound transit's design impacts Roy way, we will work with sound transit to implement Streetscape improvements that align with the goals of the Boulevard project.",319,,
1495,0.97,8836.194,8841.966,"So, again, my proposal is to amend the CIP to add funding back in 2023 and 2024.",319,,
1496,0.97,8841.966,8843.467,Thank you.,319,,
1497,0.97,8843.467,8846.137,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",320,,
1498,0.97,8846.137,8851.776,I have a quick question on this one.,320,,
1499,0.97,8851.776,8857.915,When could Sdot realistically be expected to spend the Reserve dollars?,320,,
1500,0.97,8857.915,8859.517,Do we know the answer to that?,320,,
1501,0.97,8859.517,8874.131,The reason why I'm proposing adding it in for 2023 is because we are expecting a sound transit EIS decision to be completed in 2022.,321,,
1502,0.97,8874.131,8874.398,Okay.,322,,
1503,0.97,8874.398,8874.632,Great.,322,,
1504,0.97,8874.632,8875.032,Appreciate that.,322,,
1505,0.97,8875.032,8885.076,I,322,,
1506,0.97,8962.72,8967.291,The amount of funding for the project is to be determined.,323,,
1507,0.97,8967.291,8978.336,We have a question on the amount of funding necessary and the regulation from Sdot is 3-4 million and we have questions on where the funds come from.,323,,
1508,0.97,8978.336,8989.747,Neither of those questions are answered in this particular format.,323,,

1510,0.97,8997.321,8997.955,Councilmember her bold.,324,,
1511,0.97,8997.955,9003.26,This would add reporting requests or requirements through proviso or slide.,324,,
1512,0.97,9003.26,9003.694,Councilmember.,325,,
1513,0.97,9003.694,9036.694,This is a Placeholder for reporting on the Seattle bridgework and Reconnect the West Seattle program and Reconnect West Seattle program for everybody's program is a programming attended to fund improvements and communities most impacted by Detour routes with a specific it--specific equity focus on particular neighborhoods.,326,,
1514,0.97,9036.694,9046.47,"Originally, we had heard from the Mayor that there was going to be a preferred alternative announced tomorrow.",326,,
1515,0.97,9046.47,9074.131,And so the intent was to find out more about that and help the knowledge of that preferred alternative to align with more detail in this form a for future form B. the cost benefit analysis release was delayed and we were expecting to potentially get that last Friday.,326,,
1516,0.97,9074.131,9096.854,So we will hopefully have additional time to work with Calvin to allow for more detail on this particular item and hopefully we will also hear from the West Seattle community task force with their ability to Digest the cost benefit analysis and that might also be useful for us in developing the future version.,326,,
1517,0.97,9096.854,9101.292,The final realistically because there is all of this new information coming out.,326,,
1518,0.97,9101.292,9120.845,The final version with all the details we intend for future reporting might need to be in the form C. so just giving you a heads up on that.,326,,

1522,0.97,9126.35,9128.119,Thank you also for sharing your survey data.,327,,
1523,0.97,9128.119,9136.76,I see that I loaded on news.,327,,
1524,0.97,9136.76,9138.062,Congratulations on such a high amount of participation.,327,,
1525,0.97,9138.062,9149.273,Number four was Previewed in the presentation already.,327,,
1526,0.97,9149.273,9150.407,"So highly anticipated number four, let's get to it.",327,,
1527,0.97,9150.407,9167.157,It is a proposal that may address changes in the proposed parking enforcement officer legislation budget proposal and it could include consolidating those positions and responsibilities in a separate office along with the emergency communication center.,328,,
1528,0.97,9167.157,9195.686,I want to flag that the broader proposal is not only related to where the PEO's are transferred but also to rename the new Department from what is currently proposed to be the Seattle emergency communication center to a new Seattle community safety and communication center.,329,,
1529,0.97,9195.686,9207.198,This is my effort to follow up on the PEO's request that they be transferred into this new Department rather than be transferred into Sdot.,329,,
1530,0.97,9207.198,9231.055,The Seattle PEO Guild has proposed a number of activities that they could take on after negotiations and consultations with Spog.,329,,
1531,0.97,9231.055,9242.9,"Some of those response abilities include red light camera enforcement, school zone enforcement come response to Non- injury collision, minor theft, car Break-Ins, to take the report when those Break-Ins have been and forward the report to SPD.",329,,
1532,0.97,9242.9,9249.34,Responding to reports of abandoned vehicles or Rvs and people living in them.,329,,
1533,0.97,9249.34,9254.778,Peos explained that they could inform and assist members with available resources.,329,,
1534,0.97,9254.778,9273.364,And they already do work Collaboratively with Seattle public utilities and historically with team navigators and Coordinators and civilian agencies within the air remediation program.,329,,
1535,0.97,9273.364,9299.056,"So the PEO's also are interested in taking on work related to staffing events, flagging and particularly as it relates to flagging special events, thus reducing the overtime budget of the Seattle police Department.",329,,
1536,0.97,9299.056,9318.308,And I want to flag that some of these changes might necessitate making some amendments to the budget legislation as described by Calvin earlier.,329,,
1537,0.97,9318.308,9328.952,I would like to further analyze that legislation to see what changes might need to be made to ensure that the PEO's have the authority to manage traffic at special events.,329,,
1538,0.97,9328.952,9342.433,"And we might need to again look at other elements of the legislation that might result in needing to reintroduce the bill, if there is a title change.",329,,
1539,0.97,9342.433,9362.119,And then I want to flag that we put some questions in with Sdot that we are still waiting to hear back . and just interested to learn more about what they're thinking is for transferring the unit to Sdot.,329,,
1540,0.97,9362.119,9372.162,And the work they have done to facilitate that transfer and we put that question and on the 12th and have not heard back yet.,329,,
1541,0.97,9372.162,9373.564,"Councilmember Pedersen, did you have a question on this one?",330,,
1542,0.97,9373.564,9383.774,Sorry.,331,,
1543,0.97,9386.276,9386.71,I saw you off mute.,331,,
1544,0.97,9386.71,9387.978,I thought that was the signal for wanting a question.,331,,
1545,0.97,9387.978,9388.545,Perhaps it was not.,331,,
1546,0.97,9388.545,9389.98,Any other Council members have questions or comments on this one?,331,,
1547,0.97,9389.98,9402.326,"Briefly, I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for bringing this forward and I want to signal my interest working on this.",332,,
1548,0.97,9402.326,9430.12,"I don't know if my questions would be just best addressed by central staff but I wonder where the best Avenue would be fully acknowledging that it would require bargaining on the scope of work for some of the things that were included in the letter we received from the parking enforcement officer Union on new duties that they could assume, regardless of where the unit lands.",332,,
1549,0.97,9430.12,9436.527,"If the unit is in Sdot or in the new Department, no matter where they are, they could still do this.",332,,
1550,0.97,9436.527,9448.205,And I want to flag for the general public--we have been talking a lot about noncriminal calls.,332,,
1551,0.97,9448.205,9456.48,We should acknowledge that there are a lot of criminal enforcement aspects others do beyond sworn officers for Igher vehicle enforcement can sometimes the criminal.,332,,
1552,0.97,9456.48,9460.617,That is investigated by Finance and administrative services.,332,,
1553,0.97,9460.617,9473.363,Retail theft is done through the retail theft program which is mostly civilian and privately employed loss prevention officers.,332,,
1554,0.97,9473.363,9496.72,"I would be interested in looking at what the best vehicle would be to Queue up, expanding to the entire universe of things that were outlined in the letter and to start the process now knowing that it was estimated in a public place potentially resting with the sworn officer workload.",332,,
1555,0.97,9496.72,9510.501,"And could be taken on by this new service which is 60% bi, 50% women.",332,,
1556,0.97,9510.501,9511.301,Mostly English thinking workforce.,332,,
1557,0.97,9511.301,9518.442,Very interested in Cuing that up whether it is through this vehicle or something else.,332,,
1558,0.97,9518.442,9530.988,I wanted to throw that out there is a question and see if we might be able to do that in the scope of this proposal or if there would be a more appropriate place.,332,,
1559,0.97,9530.988,9541.765,We will have to get into the issues and see how much can be done on the Timeline that the budget requires.,333,,
1560,0.97,9541.765,9550.774,It may be something that some items can be handled rather easily and others who might have to deal with bargaining or other issues and come back with separate legislation.,333,,
1561,0.97,9550.774,9561.051,I'm afraid I don't know enough about what is involved to give you a good understanding this time.,333,,
1562,0.97,9561.051,9575.832,"I think it would be possible to follow up with whatever action occurs in this budget for where these officers, these park enforcement officers go with separate legislation that might address these other duties assigned.",333,,
1563,0.97,9575.832,9582.072,Thank you.,334,,
1564,0.97,9582.072,9586.51,Councilmember Herbold.,335,,
1565,0.97,9586.51,9616.44,"I want to flag that there are a couple of separate issue . So what I have keyed up and having a strong interest in addressing in the budget legislation before us, it is about granting the authority of the PEO to do some of the work . with the total understanding that being able to act on that authority would be subject to bargaining.",336,,
1566,0.97,9616.44,9628.352,I think those are two separate issues and it is not unusual for the Council to move forward with a preferred policy approach before the bargaining is complete.,336,,
1567,0.97,9628.352,9628.719,Excellent.,337,,
1568,0.97,9628.719,9633.223,"Signaling my interest, I would love to work with you on that.",337,,
1569,0.97,9633.223,9638.328,This would be a big way forward I think.,337,,
1570,0.97,9638.328,9638.695,Thank you.,338,,
1571,0.97,9638.695,9641.865,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,338,,
1572,0.97,9641.865,9645.736,Item number five.,338,,
1573,0.97,9645.736,9660.784,"Item number five is sponsored by Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Strauss to restore $777,000 for the Thomas Street redesign project.",339,,
1574,0.97,9660.784,9669.359,Previously Council approved funding for the project in anticipation of the transportation network company task and the proceeds have not materialized in 2020.,339,,
1575,0.97,9669.359,9677.868,"Councilmember Strauss, to this?",340,,
1576,0.97,9677.868,9688.812,I worked to secure this money.,341,,
1577,0.97,9688.812,9690.447,It is to support a community like process to redesign Thomas street.,341,,
1578,0.97,9690.447,9698.255,It is an important place to the center.,341,,
1579,0.97,9698.255,9706.329,"And the rebalancing package, I believe it would be important in the line item to make sure the project came through.",341,,
1580,0.97,9706.329,9712.135,I understand there may be other funding available that has not yet materialized and that is why is important to keep this as a line item.,341,,
1581,0.97,9712.135,9725.716,This project extends Seattle center and to South Lake Union and connects the skate park as walking and Biking extends the Seattle center campus.,341,,
1582,0.97,9725.716,9727.818,Into South Lake Union and connections to buses from Bothell to Burien.,341,,
1583,0.97,9727.818,9742.165,"It will become an important front door for the cultural center . and I just want to note that when the street design occurred originally in 2013, the city had a very different understanding of what pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure is.",341,,
1584,0.97,9742.165,9752.275,"At that point, there was a standard sidewalk.",341,,
1585,0.97,9752.275,9752.743,And a two a street.,341,,
1586,0.97,9752.743,9766.189,"And I bring this up because on the Sr99 closed, Harrison was designed for transit and then John for cars and Thomas, for pedestrians.",341,,
1587,0.97,9766.189,9766.756,The update--and among.,341,,
1588,0.97,9766.756,9776.099,Hey.,342,,
1589,0.97,9776.099,9776.933,Just finishing up these updates.,343,,
1590,0.97,9776.933,9785.842,To bring pedestrian Street--to bring the standards to what pedestrian streets are today.,343,,
1591,0.97,9785.842,9795.752,And then this can--we need to protect this line item.,343,,
1592,0.97,9795.752,9798.522,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,344,,
1593,0.97,9798.522,9799.456,"Councilmember Lewis, anything to add?",344,,
1594,0.97,9799.456,9803.193,I should say this is a critical piece of infrastructure and District 7.,345,,
1595,0.97,9803.193,9804.427,And one of the city's fastest growing neighborhoods.,345,,
1596,0.97,9804.427,9815.438,I want to make sure we are maintaining pedestrian and bike infrastructure and protecting and expanding it even in these difficult times.,345,,
1597,0.97,9815.438,9825.515,"And I appreciate the support of Councilmember Strauss and the work of Councilmember bag shot and Councilmember Strauss, what they did to keep the project on track.",345,,
1598,0.97,9825.515,9840.73,It is an essential component of the improvements we are building in anticipation of having a fully Souped up and restored climate pledge arena at the Seattle center.,345,,
1599,0.97,9840.73,9847.037,And this is an intimate part of the transportation planning for the Seattle center.,345,,
1600,0.97,9847.037,9856.846,And looking forward to that arena opening . continuing to be a big supporter of this and want to make sure that we keep moving along.,345,,
1601,0.97,9856.846,9858.849,Any questions colleagues?,346,,
1602,0.97,9858.849,9869.259,I'm not seeing any.,347,,
1603,0.97,9869.659,9871.061,Item number six is from Councilmember Lewis.,348,,
1604,0.97,9871.061,9881.504,This proposal would restore funding for the market to Mosque--Mohi project.,348,,

1606,0.97,9881.771,9882.973,Similar to the last item.,348,,
1607,0.97,9882.973,9888.278,The funding had anticipated using the transportation network company tax which has not materialized.,348,,
1608,0.97,9888.278,9894.885,"Councilmember Strauss, you are up again.",349,,
1609,0.97,9894.885,9895.452,Thank you Madam chair.,350,,
1610,0.97,9895.452,9924.547,"As we look forward to recovering from the Covid-19 recession and rebuilding our local economy and rebuilding our tourism, it is going to be important to maintain a lot of these infrastructure investments to connect a lot of the critical pedestrian corridors between Mohi and the downtown core.",350,,
1611,0.97,9924.547,9939.029,There has been considerable investment over the last decade and expanding and building up the area around Mohi and building it out in the new location in the South Lake Union neighborhood.,350,,
1612,0.97,9939.029,9958.949,And making sure we are encouraging folks to walk and congregate in a lot of our great and Iconic cultural and civic institutions and Tyner square and South Lake Union.,350,,
1613,0.97,9958.949,9982.272,"This is a critical connection to make sure that we continue to put resources behind, emphasizing pedestrian improvements and the synergy that it has with a lot of our collaboration with partners and our cultural and business partners in building out these opportunities in the core of the city.",350,,
1614,0.97,9982.272,9996.853,I want to make sure we maintain this and I want to thank Councilmember Strauss for his work and Councilmember bag Shaw for her work moving this forward and make sure we keep it going.,350,,
1615,0.97,9996.853,9997.454,Any additional comments?,351,,
1616,0.97,9997.454,9999.389,Okay.,352,,
1617,0.97,9999.389,10004.894,Let's move on.,352,,
1618,0.97,10004.894,10005.228,Number seven.,352,,
1619,0.97,10005.228,10009.632,Number seven is also from Councilmember Lewis.,353,,
1620,0.97,10009.632,10020.944,It would reverse highs capital spending to fund a new project development for a shoreline bicycle and a stern path near the Southern edge of magnolia park.,353,,
1621,0.97,10020.944,10027.684,"At the time that this proposal was put fourth, it contemplated a million dollars in 2021 with future funding.",353,,
1622,0.97,10027.684,10032.989,Councilmember Lewis.,354,,
1623,0.97,10032.989,10034.057,I can't speak to the price tag.,355,,
1624,0.97,10034.057,10038.862,And this is something still being worked out.,355,,
1625,0.97,10038.862,10047.137,I think a million dollars for this project would be a pretty heavy LIFTS given the circumstances we are facing right now.,355,,
1626,0.97,10047.137,10068.224,I do want to make sure that we are having some kind of coordinated effort in Partnering with folks that have been organizing to put in a bike and pedestrian connection that is on--that would be on city land in this area near the Marina and near Smith Cove and magnolia.,355,,
1627,0.97,10068.224,10079.335,And this connection would hitch up a stretch of road that leads from magnolia village to the broader Interbase like network.,355,,
1628,0.97,10079.335,10096.786,It would help facilitate bike and pedestrian connections from magnolia to the rest of the city and would increase the Multimodal opportunities for people to commute from magnolia that do not involve single occupancy vehicles.,355,,
1629,0.97,10096.786,10137.227,"This might be a better candidate for sort of a statement of legislative intent for a little bit more collaboration between Sdot and parks and looking into this corridor, and collaboration with a citizen group and magnolia that has been working with the Department of neighborhoods on this for some time in terms of looking at the feasibility but would like to formalize the process a little more within I--with the eye toward Queuing this up toward a bike and pedestrian corridor that we could realize without the need to acquire land since it would be on existing property that is city-owned.",355,,
1630,0.97,10137.227,10145.835,And currently not being utilized.,355,,
1631,0.97,10145.835,10146.836,Thank you very much Councilmember Lewis.,356,,
1632,0.97,10146.836,10158.781,Thank you for your indication that this might be possible slight material.,356,,
1633,0.97,10158.781,10159.148,Next item.,357,,
1634,0.97,10159.148,10161.284,Next is item number eight.,358,,
1635,0.97,10161.284,10162.785,Also from Councilmember Lewis.,358,,
1636,0.97,10162.785,10173.93,It would Reprioritize funding to provide for traffic for streets or.,358,,
1637,0.97,10173.93,10175.064,Councilmember Lewis.,359,,
1638,0.97,10175.064,10177.3,Thank you Madam chair.,360,,
1639,0.97,10177.3,10185.141,I have a couple of projects coming up that are related to things people in my district have been organizing around all year with my office.,360,,
1640,0.97,10185.141,10212.602,"And my office has been working with Sdot on to try to figure out some kind of long of--long-term solution to particular materials that have been problematic, shall I say, in terms of chronic speeding and a lack of traffic calming interventions.",360,,
1641,0.97,10212.602,10216.94,North Queen Anne is three quarters of a mile arterial.,360,,
1642,0.97,10216.94,10218.041,It stretches from Nickerson to first Avenue West.,360,,
1643,0.97,10218.041,10223.446,Kind of around the Spu campus.,360,,
1644,0.97,10223.446,10228.751,This particular arterial has been problematic for a number of reasons.,360,,
1645,0.97,10228.751,10229.652,Sorry Councilmember Lewis.,361,,
1646,0.97,10229.652,10243.266,Can you mute the background noise for Elizabeth's line.,361,,
1647,0.97,10243.266,10243.866,Thank you Madam chair.,362,,
1648,0.97,10243.866,10260.483,A lot of folks speed through from first Avenue West and Nickerson and there have been several collisions on the stretch.,362,,
1649,0.97,10260.483,10262.819,"For Quasi- residential, a lot of people live directly on it.",362,,
1650,0.97,10262.819,10263.453,It has been very problematic.,362,,
1651,0.97,10263.453,10281.037,There are also a lot of people who bike down to connect to the bike path network that runs to the shift Canal on either side Pickett has posed a hazard to bikers and pedestrians as well.,362,,
1652,0.97,10281.037,10293.516,Is an area where potentially putting in speed bumps and other traffic calming interventions could have a big difference.,362,,
1653,0.97,10293.516,10297.954,It is a smaller arterial that does not currently served by mass transit.,362,,
1654,0.97,10297.954,10308.331,So there wouldn't be a potential issue and slowing down a Metro bus or what have you that I know is the concern for Sdot on certain Arterials.,362,,
1655,0.97,10308.331,10310.833,So I would like to certainly pursue.,362,,
1656,0.97,10310.833,10318.374,And this could be combined with other measures to generally restore funds that provide these kinds of traffic calming interventions.,362,,
1657,0.97,10318.374,10333.056,"But I wanted to flag this area in particular, given the considerable constituent concern and demand.",362,,
1658,0.97,10333.056,10333.656,Councilmember Herbold.,363,,
1659,0.97,10333.656,10339.595,This is a question for Calvin.,364,,
1660,0.97,10339.595,10349.605,"Whenever I have reached out to Sdot on behalf of constituents in my district about projects like this, I have always been pointed to programs like, your voice, your choice.",364,,
1661,0.97,10349.605,10361.851,Do you know whether or not funding for Sdot related projects is steady for 2021?,364,,
1662,0.97,10361.851,10370.56,Or should I direct that question to another central staffer?,364,,
1663,0.97,10370.56,10372.695,I can certainly follow up you to try to get a better sense.,365,,
1664,0.97,10372.695,10380.87,"Some of these projects could be eligible for your voice, your choice.",365,,
1665,0.97,10380.87,10385.875,But there are other programmatic spending and the Department that may address these kind of issues as well.,365,,
1666,0.97,10385.875,10390.213,There may be several programs that could be eligible for different kinds of traffic calming.,365,,
1667,0.97,10390.213,10403.326,But I want to do a little more research to see how spending levels differ from what had been anticipated last year.,365,,
1668,0.97,10403.326,10410.233,"Specifically with your voice, your choice, one of the issues there is that it has tended to be, I believe a three year grab cycle.",365,,
1669,0.97,10410.233,10420.91,"So the funding, you can't necessarily look from year to year, changes on what that funding picture looks like.",365,,
1670,0.97,10420.91,10433.756,It's intended to get the ideas Vetted and then developed and then constructed over a period of time.,365,,
1671,0.97,10433.756,10438.161,"I would also want to flag that, as it relates to projects like this, as common says, there is your voice, your choice.",366,,
1672,0.97,10438.161,10449.472,There are other parts of funding within Sdot for these kinds of traffic calming projects.,366,,
1673,0.97,10449.472,10455.444,Sdot sort of has an approach that they use for how they Prioritize projects.,366,,
1674,0.97,10455.444,10466.722,Collision history is a big flag for them.,366,,
1675,0.97,10466.722,10467.89,Equity issues are also something they consider.,366,,
1676,0.97,10467.89,10493.316,And I just would not want an action that we would take through the budget process to circumvent the approach that Sdot uses for equitable and fair distribution of finite public resources at the entire city needs.,366,,
1677,0.97,10493.316,10494.917,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,367,,
1678,0.97,10494.917,10497.82,Very similar to the comments I was going to make.,367,,
1679,0.97,10497.82,10519.141,"For all of these items especially in the Sdot category, I think one of the first questions I will be asking is, how does this fit with the Rsji principles and how does that fit in with priorities that have already been identified through things like the Seattle levee and other projects where we know there is a Prioritization system that has been pretty robust.",367,,
1680,0.97,10519.141,10520.543,I just want to flag that for all the items we are looking at.,367,,
1681,0.97,10520.543,10523.513,Those are the questions I will be asking.,367,,
1682,0.97,10523.513,10524.447,Let's move on to the next one.,367,,
1683,0.97,10524.447,10529.018,Item number nine.,367,,
1684,0.97,10529.018,10529.886,This is from Councilmember Lewis.,368,,
1685,0.97,10529.886,10534.757,"It is about the your voice, your choice program.",368,,
1686,0.97,10534.757,10541.197,And anticipates restoring funding.,368,,
1687,0.97,10541.197,10556.913,"At the time the proposal was submitted, it proposed 279,000 Woul be Prioritized for the program . I believe this, looking at the 2020 funding from last year's anticipated budget, the project is down by about $1 million.",368,,
1688,0.97,10556.913,10557.446,Councilmember Lewis.,369,,
1689,0.97,10557.446,10615.671,"Related to the comments Councilmember Herbold and Madam chair just made, my intense unflagging some of these projects is certainly to approach them with the context of some of the existing mechanisms Sdot has to address them which is why in addition to flagging these particular projects, I'm seeking to restore funding to your voice, your choice . I think, although we are seeing considerable slow down in the economy from from Covid- 19, there is a massive backlog of work all over the city that needs to be done to realize a lot of these kind of pedestrian and traffic calming projects.",370,,
1690,0.97,10615.671,10630.086,"And I would want to make sure that even in these difficult times, that we are allowing for these Neighborhood-Based mechanisms of getting the projects it resolved to continue to be funded.",370,,
1691,0.97,10630.086,10632.655,That is why I brought this forward.,370,,
1692,0.97,10632.655,10650.339,"It is one of the things that I hear the most from my constituents, which is concern about runaway traffic and I want to make sure, given that that is clearly flagged by so many people this year, that it is something that stays a priority.",370,,
1693,0.97,10650.339,10651.14,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,371,,
1694,0.97,10651.14,10652.241,Not seeing additional comments on this on.,371,,
1695,0.97,10652.241,10661.183,Go to item number 10.,371,,
1696,0.97,10661.183,10664.186,Number 10 is Councilmember Lewis reserving funding for sidewalk repair on West McGraw street.,372,,
1697,0.97,10664.186,10674.664,"The proposal is for $10,000.",372,,
1698,0.97,10676.365,10682.672,"I would address this through programs like your voice, your choice.",373,,
1699,0.97,10682.672,10695.718,I did flag a couple of these projects that have been the result of considerable community organizing in my district just to plant a flag on them and move forward on trying to get them addressed.,373,,
1700,0.97,10695.718,10699.088,I think I will rest on my previous comments.,373,,
1701,0.97,10699.088,10708.698,But this sidewalk in particular has posed a hazard to the business district and this particular part of magnolia.,373,,
1702,0.97,10708.698,10717.373,There have been injuries from people tripping and falling down as a results of the poorly maintained sidewalk.,373,,
1703,0.97,10717.373,10718.507,It is not a unique story around the city.,373,,
1704,0.97,10718.507,10734.757,And would just like to make sure projects like this one and projects similarly situated can continue to be addressed as an essential city infrastructure service.,373,,
1705,0.97,10734.757,10735.591,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,374,,
1706,0.97,10735.591,10745.568,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",374,,
1707,0.97,10745.568,10745.768,.,375,,
1708,0.97,10745.768,10753.042,"Any way to address this, I'm definitely on board.",376,,
1709,0.97,10753.042,10754.643,It is really important and appreciate your leadership on that.,376,,
1710,0.97,10754.643,10762.151,And I would work with you on that resolution.,376,,
1711,0.97,10762.151,10762.752,Making progress already.,377,,
1712,0.97,10762.752,10763.152,Thank you both.,377,,
1713,0.97,10763.152,10769.325,Let's go to number 11.,377,,
1714,0.97,10769.325,10775.464,"Number 11, I think is another one of the items Councilmember Lewis spoke about.",378,,
1715,0.97,10775.464,10778.234,It would Reprioritize funding for traffic improvements to tenth Avenue West.,378,,
1716,0.97,10778.234,10782.705,My old street.,379,,
1717,0.97,10782.705,10783.672,"Councilmember Lewis, let's talk about this.",379,,
1718,0.97,10783.672,10789.612,I have improvements on all the streets that Teresa Mosqueda used to live on.,380,,
1719,0.97,10789.612,10790.179,So this is a great.,380,,
1720,0.97,10790.179,10796.952,This has been another central area where there has been a lot of organizing in the districts.,380,,
1721,0.97,10796.952,10806.762,I have had a constituent who has had a vehicle flip over on his lawn because of speeding in this arterial.,380,,
1722,0.97,10806.762,10811.167,It is something that has resolutely been identified as an issue.,380,,
1723,0.97,10811.167,10821.844,"So this would be in the Queue certainly for funds if your voice, your choice are similar programs that had funding restored.",380,,
1724,0.97,10821.844,10830.352,I believe this is the one that has the most firms scoring on it.,380,,
1725,0.97,10830.352,10831.72,"And so, any way that we address that, I'm open to it.",380,,
1726,0.97,10831.72,10846.135,"Just flagging that this is another priority, another corridor that is a priority and one that we would like to see addressed addressed.",380,,
1727,0.97,10846.135,10848.137,Thank you so much.,381,,
1728,0.97,10848.137,10850.272,We lost the Slideshow presentation.,381,,
1729,0.97,10850.272,10851.874,"But for folks following along, we are on page 15 of the memo.",381,,
1730,0.97,10851.874,10852.708,We are on item number 10 right now.,381,,
1731,0.97,10852.708,10855.878,And here comes the Slideshow back.,381,,
1732,0.97,10855.878,10856.312,Thank you so much.,381,,
1733,0.97,10856.312,10863.619,I'm using -,382,,
1734,0.97,10863.619,10865.421,This works.,383,,
1735,0.97,10865.421,10871.293,You put a lot of work into the presentation and the memo this might be easier to see what is coming up anyway.,383,,
1736,0.97,10871.293,10875.097,So that was covering number 11 which was tenth Avenue West.,383,,
1737,0.97,10875.097,10884.006,Item number 12. item 12 for Councilmember Pedersen would add funding for% bridge maintenance.,384,,
1738,0.97,10884.006,10894.316,It would add $24 million that would achieve the spending levels identified by the city auditor's 2020 report on bridge maintenance.,384,,
1739,0.97,10894.316,10901.29,And the idea for this proposal is to Reprioritize resources that are not currently in the Sdot proposed budget.,384,,
1740,0.97,10901.29,10906.028,Thank you.,385,,
1741,0.97,10906.028,10908.53,Councilmember Mosqueda.,385,,
1742,0.97,10908.53,10920.509,"As we know, the recent independent audit of bridges across Seattle conducted by the city auditor concluded that the city government has been substantially under investing in the maintenance of our bridges.",386,,
1743,0.97,10920.509,10929.952,The result of Underfunding the bridge infrastructure increases the risk of harm and disruption and failing to invest add it.,386,,
1744,0.97,10929.952,10933.522,Levels today might mean taxpayers have to bear an even larger replacement cost later.,386,,
1745,0.97,10933.522,10935.557,Pay now or pay more later.,386,,
1746,0.97,10935.557,10951.373,"So while Sdot believes lack of maintenance was not the reason for the failure of the West Seattle bridge, the sudden closure of the bridge should be a Wake-Up call and this budget would increase the Sdot budget to provide the bare minimum of maintenance funding for 2021 which would be up to 24 million.",386,,
1747,0.97,10951.373,10961.85,24 million is the 1% of the 1- 3% recommended bridge value for funding maintenance.,386,,
1748,0.97,10961.85,10967.723,And happy to answer any questions.,386,,
1749,0.97,10967.723,10973.095,I want to ask about anyone's ads.,386,,
1750,0.97,10973.095,10979.301,I want to come and my colleagues were looking out for their districts and proposing things they have heard that the districts need.,386,,
1751,0.97,10979.301,10980.169,And I think it is really appropriate.,386,,
1752,0.97,10980.169,10989.878,We have gotten shortages here on funding.,386,,
1753,0.97,10989.878,10996.185,And I want to commend my colleagues were looking out for their districts when it comes to funding.,386,,
1754,0.97,10996.185,11000.923,"This particular issue, bridges would be citywide and impact multiple districts.",386,,
1755,0.97,11000.923,11005.527,Thank you.,386,,
1756,0.97,11005.527,11008.197,And we appreciate the audit that was conducted earlier that provides details.,387,,
1757,0.97,11008.197,11012.868,"Are there questions on this? Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",387,,
1758,0.97,11012.868,11016.372,More of a statement than a question.,388,,
1759,0.97,11016.372,11029.918,"In recognition of the audit flag, the understanding that I think we all share, that the lack of infrastructure and investment is a national problem.",388,,
1760,0.97,11029.918,11046.735,That is why we have a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill that is stuck in the Senate right now.,388,,
1761,0.97,11046.735,11053.909,"For bridges nationally, there is 123 billion-dollar backlog for bridge rehabilitation and maintenance needs.",388,,
1762,0.97,11053.909,11087.576,The fact that we desperately need help from the Federal Government and should receive help from the Federal Government to meet these needs is not a reason for the city to not work to do more to respond to city auditor that I take very seriously to increase the funding that the city provides to achieve these recommended spending levels.,388,,
1763,0.97,11087.576,11089.211,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,389,,
1764,0.97,11089.211,11089.845,I also have a question.,389,,
1765,0.97,11089.845,11099.721,"Given the large price tag imposed on this item here, are their areas identified to cut from?",389,,
1766,0.97,11099.721,11116.171,And given what we are looking at an terms of cuts for mobility related projects for safe streets and people walking or Biking in transit and we know that it is mostly essential workers at this point who are being impacted by these current coats.,389,,
1767,0.97,11116.171,11125.814,Can you talk a little bit more about where the slated reductions would come from for mostly cars Citric proposal here?,389,,
1768,0.97,11125.814,11131.12,Thank you chair Transacting for the question.,390,,
1769,0.97,11131.12,11136.925,It could come from multiple sources.,390,,
1770,0.97,11136.925,11138.527,We are still awaiting the revenue forecast update from the executive.,390,,
1771,0.97,11138.527,11148.737,We still have to talk about the vehicle license fee issue.,390,,
1772,0.97,11148.737,11151.974,"And I would say, buses and bikes use bridges too.",390,,
1773,0.97,11151.974,11152.574,"Pedestrians, some of them.",390,,
1774,0.97,11152.574,11163.619,"So I think bridges help all modes of transportation . and because of the city auditor's report, I just want to be mindful of the call to action that it has.",390,,
1775,0.97,11163.619,11176.398,"And so really just putting on the table here that this is an important infrastructure issue for the city and the region and if we are able to find additional dollars, we want to have that considered as well.",390,,
1776,0.97,11176.398,11182.538,Thank you so much.,391,,
1777,0.97,11182.538,11183.272,Let's move on to the next item.,391,,
1778,0.97,11183.272,11193.815,Number 13 is from Councilmember Gonzalez Reprioritizing funding for the Capitol Hill study.,392,,
1779,0.97,11193.815,11203.792,"This would restore $150,000 that counsel previously authorized but was anticipated using transportation network company tax receipts.",392,,
1780,0.97,11203.792,11205.527,Any additional comments on this?,393,,
1781,0.97,11205.527,11214.202,"Quickly, this item would advance funding support for a public life study that was approved as part of last year's budget.",394,,
1782,0.97,11214.202,11222.611,This was a Council identified priority last year that has been proposed to be cut by the Mayor.,394,,
1783,0.97,11222.611,11230.118,"And as noted by Calvin, the funding source was originally proposed to be the TNC revenue which has not yet materialized.",394,,
1784,0.97,11230.118,11245.1,"I continue to believe the study is important as we will be able to learn from the most dense neighborhood about how we can apply lessons learned there in this study to make every neighborhood Multimodal, climate resilient and Vibrance.",394,,
1785,0.97,11245.1,11254.743,And I believe this effort is even more important now as the city and the neighborhood leaders continue to build a strategy for recovery post Covid-19.,394,,
1786,0.97,11254.743,11261.416,Happy to answer any questions.,394,,
1787,0.97,11261.416,11263.986,Think you Council President.,395,,
1788,0.97,11263.986,11266.188,Any additional questions?,395,,
1789,0.97,11266.188,11266.521,Thing on.,395,,
1790,0.97,11266.521,11266.989,Let's go to item 14.,395,,
1791,0.97,11266.989,11275.464,Item 14 is from Councilmember Morales Prickett would Reprioritize funding for the Georgetown Southpark trail.,396,,
1792,0.97,11275.464,11281.103,The proposed C I can P does not include funding for the project.,396,,
1793,0.97,11281.103,11283.772,Last year--it did secure the 1.8 million.,396,,
1794,0.97,11283.772,11295.717,The amount of funding product proposal is not determined.,396,,
1795,0.97,11295.717,11297.286,Councilmember Morales.,397,,
1796,0.97,11297.286,11298.553,"As you know, Georgetown is connected by the river.",398,,
1797,0.97,11298.553,11306.695,So there is a shared history and a shared sense of needs particularly environmental concerns.,398,,
1798,0.97,11306.695,11311.066,Air and water and noise quality there.,398,,
1799,0.97,11311.066,11323.745,"For more than 20 years, people living and working in both communities have called for a safe comfortable groups for people walking Biking between the two areas.",398,,
1800,0.97,11323.745,11333.355,"The funding would support a critical connection between the neighborhoods and especially now with the West Seattle bridge out, there is a lot of traffic being diverted through the neighborhoods.",398,,
1801,0.97,11333.355,11344.132,So they are in need of better infrastructure to mitigate the increased traffic there.,398,,
1802,0.97,11344.132,11354.476,And are particularly interested in ways to get out of their cars and find other ways to move between the neighborhoods and right now between different parts of town.,398,,
1803,0.97,11354.476,11358.647,Counsel colleague questions on this one?,399,,
1804,0.97,11358.647,11371.159,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",400,,
1805,0.97,11371.159,11374.162,Thank you to Councilmember Morales for raising the issue.,401,,
1806,0.97,11374.162,11376.031,And you may have addressed this and I just missed it.,401,,
1807,0.97,11376.031,11380.535,We took action on this last year.,401,,
1808,0.97,11380.535,11384.673,Can you remind me what action we took last year?,401,,
1809,0.97,11384.673,11389.845,And what the source of funding was?,401,,
1810,0.97,11389.845,11392.547,I'm afraid I just do not recall at this moment.,402,,
1811,0.97,11392.547,11397.452,But I would be happy to get back with you with that information.,402,,
1812,0.97,11397.452,11414.569,I thought that this was one of the projects that the Council Prioritized through the budget process.,403,,
1813,0.97,11414.569,11416.538,My memory may be faulty.,404,,
1814,0.97,11416.538,11420.776,I seem to recall it coming up in the context of the Mercer MEGA block precedents from a couple of years ago.,404,,
1815,0.97,11420.776,11428.984,And it has been on the--I don't recall if it was fully funded in that proposal.,404,,
1816,0.97,11428.984,11429.785,I will have to go back and look.,404,,
1817,0.97,11429.785,11436.558,There were a number of bike projects that hadn't been talked about.,404,,
1818,0.97,11436.558,11444.366,I'm afraid I just don't recall if it was fully funded in any of those or if it was through development funding approved at the time.,404,,
1819,0.97,11444.366,11444.833,"Okay, thank you.",405,,
1820,0.97,11444.833,11445.634,I would appreciate learning more.,405,,
1821,0.97,11445.634,11480.869,"And also as it relates to Reconnect West Seattle, there are a number of projects that Sdot has already committed to as part of Reconnect West Seattle and Reconnect was Seattle is Sdot's effort to focus capital dollars in communities that are not only most impacted by the traffic Detour routes associated with the closure of the bridge but impacted specifically with equity focus.",405,,
1822,0.97,11480.869,11486.241,So looking at communities that have historically been under invested in.,405,,
1823,0.97,11486.241,11498.62,So I know that they have already announced the phase 1 projects for funding under Reconnect West Seattle.,405,,
1824,0.97,11498.62,11513.134,"It would be helpful to understand whether or not this--I know that for the Reconnect West Seattle process, Sdot went out and surveyed the public about what the High-Priority projects are.",405,,
1825,0.97,11513.134,11514.202,And I know this is a very high priority project.,405,,
1826,0.97,11514.202,11521.877,"So I'm just wondering, has this been tagged by Sdot as a phase 2 project?",405,,
1827,0.97,11521.877,11522.611,I seem to recall that it was.,405,,
1828,0.97,11522.611,11530.852,"And if it was tagged as a phase 2 project, I'm just wondering why there are no funds for it.",405,,
1829,0.97,11530.852,11540.395,"It was Fund by the West Seattle project, it would be in the West Seattle CIP projects page.",406,,
1830,0.97,11540.395,11546.568,It could be that the funding is in a different category and I will have to follow-up NC.,406,,
1831,0.97,11546.568,11546.968,I hope it is.,407,,
1832,0.97,11546.968,11550.438,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,408,,
1833,0.97,11550.438,11559.848,The three of us can have a conversation.,408,,
1834,0.97,11559.848,11560.482,Thank you for that summary.,409,,
1835,0.97,11560.482,11566.988,Did you have anything else to add?,409,,
1836,0.97,11566.988,11574.062,It was specifically related to the actions taken and last year's budget for the Georgetown to Southpark trail.,410,,
1837,0.97,11574.062,11580.101,"I don't know the answer to the question, whether or not it was fully funded and as Calvin said, he can follow up on that.",410,,
1838,0.97,11580.101,11606.361,"There was a certain shift and funds from the Mercer MEGA block to what was intended to spend in future years or in 2020 in a proviso imposed on about 10.4 in million dollars correct specifically for implementation of bike facilities on Martin Luther King Jr. way, beacon Avenue and the Georgetown to Southpark trail.",410,,
1839,0.97,11606.361,11609.798,That was the action taken and last year's adopted budget.,410,,
1840,0.97,11609.798,11610.498,So what happened?,411,,
1841,0.97,11610.498,11617.172,That I do not know.,412,,
1842,0.97,11617.172,11621.142,We will get more information on that.,413,,
1843,0.97,11621.142,11621.843,Thank you for the questions.,413,,
1844,0.97,11621.843,11622.644,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,413,,
1845,0.97,11622.644,11629.15,Any additional questions?,413,,
1846,0.97,11629.15,11630.251,"Seeing on, let's move on to item number 15.",413,,
1847,0.97,11630.251,11637.225,Item 15 is also from Councilmember Morales and is another somewhat related issue.,414,,
1848,0.97,11637.225,11638.46,Funding for bicycle connections on East marginal way.,414,,
1849,0.97,11638.46,11649.371,"I believe this project--Sdot had previously programmed $400,000 for the project for the master plan CIP project.",414,,
1850,0.97,11649.371,11650.138,Councilmember Morales.,415,,
1851,0.97,11650.138,11658.38,"Actually, Kevin, I'm hoping you can answer this.",416,,
1852,0.97,11658.38,11662.083,It is my understanding from advocates that this is fully funded and we don't need to do a form B for this.,416,,
1853,0.97,11662.083,11666.488,Can you provide any clarity on that?,416,,
1854,0.97,11666.488,11670.225,I can't at this time but I would be happy to track this down and confirm that for you.,417,,
1855,0.97,11670.225,11673.895,Thank you.,418,,
1856,0.97,11673.895,11674.262,We can move on.,418,,
1857,0.97,11674.262,11682.137,Next item.,419,,
1858,0.97,11682.137,11683.538,Any questions?,420,,
1859,0.97,11683.538,11685.507,"Councilmember Morales, you are making our lives easier.",421,,
1860,0.97,11685.507,11690.078,We have 15 minutes and just three more items.,421,,
1861,0.97,11690.078,11691.713,"So we can do this, folks.",421,,
1862,0.97,11691.713,11697.519,Item 16 would Reprioritize funding for sidewalk repair on Renner Avenue South and identifies $1 million for this purpose.,422,,
1863,0.97,11697.519,11698.019,Councilmember Morales.,422,,
1864,0.97,11698.019,11702.424,Please go ahead Councilmember Morales.,423,,
1865,0.97,11702.424,11711.833,"As we heard in public comment after the call in, continuing the work.",424,,
1866,0.97,11711.833,11723.044,"Even if the work on the rapid ride R is suspended or delayed now, the sidewalk improvements that would have gone with it along Rainier are really important.",424,,
1867,0.97,11723.044,11728.717,We have a lot of folks in the districts who are mobility impaired.,424,,
1868,0.97,11728.717,11735.824,A lot of folks with Canes walking up and down Rainier.,424,,
1869,0.97,11735.824,11742.831,There is a food bank that gets a lot of people coming to the area twice a week.,424,,
1870,0.97,11742.831,11750.538,And a lot of busy streets as you know.,424,,
1871,0.97,11750.538,11752.64,We want to make sure we are continuing the sidewalk improvements along the route seven.,424,,
1872,0.97,11752.64,11766.688,That still needs to happen to serve those who rely on that road for safe access along and across what is the most dangerous road in the city.,424,,
1873,0.97,11766.688,11770.792,So we are looking to restore that in the budget.,424,,
1874,0.97,11770.792,11780.769,"Councilmembers, questions on this quick Councilmember Morales, thank you for Flogging this.",425,,
1875,0.97,11780.769,11795.35,"In alignment with the conversations we have already had for specific areas of the city, I will continue to look to see how this fits in with the various priorities that Sdot has previously used and we look forward to working with you all.",425,,
1876,0.97,11795.35,11800.588,Seeing no additional questions on this.,425,,
1877,0.97,11800.588,11801.556,"Councilmember Juarez, did you have anything?",425,,
1878,0.97,11801.556,11804.792,Just double checking.,425,,
1879,0.97,11804.792,11805.26,Councilmember Sawant.,425,,
1880,0.97,11805.26,11808.062,You did have something?,426,,
1881,0.97,11808.062,11813.234,I'm good.,427,,
1882,0.97,11813.234,11813.568,Thank you.,427,,
1883,0.97,11813.568,11813.935,Thank you.,428,,
1884,0.97,11813.935,11817.105,Two more items.,428,,
1885,0.97,11817.105,11817.672,Councilmember Sawant.,428,,
1886,0.97,11817.672,11825.847,Item number 17 is from Council number Sawant.,429,,
1887,0.97,11825.847,11833.988,It would address an additional 117 million of General funds to Sdot to restore cuts in the Sdot budget.,429,,
1888,0.97,11833.988,11839.961,"Councilmember Sawant, please go ahead.",430,,
1889,0.97,11839.961,11840.595,Thank you.,431,,
1890,0.97,11840.595,11845.5,"Earlier this morning, I was talking about the budget cuts to the parks Department.",431,,
1891,0.97,11845.5,11846.234,This is a similar situation.,431,,
1892,0.97,11846.234,11857.612,This budget amendment would restore the funding for all of the draconian budget cuts to transportation being threatened by the Mayor's proposed budget.,431,,
1893,0.97,11857.612,11867.288,"For the permanent transportation, the Mayor has proposed cutting a staggering 117 million.",431,,
1894,0.97,11867.288,11868.523,And there is some exultation I wanted to provide.,431,,
1895,0.97,11868.523,11885.34,"I stayed in Realtime because there are, in the view of my office, important Accountings being done by the Mayor's budget to hide the scale of the cuts to the Department.",431,,
1896,0.97,11885.34,11893.314,"For example, the $15 million that funds Seattle's parking enforcement was moved from this budget to the police Department to Sdot.",431,,
1897,0.97,11893.314,11895.55,This is an accounting trick and does not change the real function of parking enforcement in any way.,431,,
1898,0.97,11895.55,11900.154,And what we mean by Defunding the police.,431,,
1899,0.97,11900.154,11908.396,"It also means that the budget, it looks like there are $50 million in new funding but that is not real and does not go to buses and roads.",431,,
1900,0.97,11908.396,11922.944,And I want to highlight that the transportation benefit district package the Council approved for the ballot is smaller than the one for the District which is expiring.,431,,
1901,0.97,11922.944,11934.722,"When the council voted over the summer to place this on the ballot, I said at that time I would bring in an amendment to the budget committee to restore the lost funding for budgets.",431,,
1902,0.97,11934.722,11937.525,And it is very important.,431,,
1903,0.97,11937.525,11939.027,That is part of what this amendment would do.,431,,
1904,0.97,11939.027,11955.576,"So including all the cuts to transportation, including the decrees in the Metro funding and accounting tricks around parking enforcement, the Mayor is cutting a staggering 117 million from transportation.",431,,
1905,0.97,11955.576,11958.179,"As we discussed this morning, there is nothing inevitable about these cuts.",431,,
1906,0.97,11958.179,11958.88,They are a policy decision.,431,,
1907,0.97,11958.88,11965.853,"If they do happen, rather than increasing the tax on big business.",431,,
1908,0.97,11965.853,11983.371,"And I wanted to clarify that when we did our estimate calculation, we did not include the--funding because at that time recently 976 initiative was struck down.",431,,
1909,0.97,11983.371,11994.949,"I wanted to further note that, as my office has said many times before, the aggressive tax to the aggressive measure used.",431,,
1910,0.97,11994.949,11997.919,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,432,,
1911,0.97,11997.919,11998.319,Any questions?,432,,
1912,0.97,11998.319,12005.326,"Seeing none, one more item in the memo here.",432,,
1913,0.97,12005.326,12005.827,Calvin.,432,,
1914,0.97,12005.827,12011.165,Last item is also from Councilmember Sawant which would Reprioritize funding for the West marginal way safe Street accessibility improvement project.,433,,
1915,0.97,12011.165,12022.61,The project was previously identified by counsel in the 2020 budget anticipated using transportation network company text proceeds.,433,,
1916,0.97,12022.61,12026.781,Councilmember Sawant.,434,,
1917,0.97,12026.781,12027.148,Thank you.,435,,
1918,0.97,12027.148,12032.82,This is the budget amendment to fund the safe Street crossing.,435,,
1919,0.97,12032.82,12043.865,Community members have been advocating for this since 2009 when the area open for a safe way to cross the incredibly busy West marginal way.,435,,
1920,0.97,12043.865,12053.474,It is not an exaggeration to say people are risking their lives crossing the street every time they go to or from the Longhouse.,435,,
1921,0.97,12053.474,12064.852,"Councilmembers may remember that during the public hearing, several people called into demand the safety improvements at the crosswalk, traffic signals, pedestrian Walkway or bus stops.",435,,
1922,0.97,12064.852,12068.222,Also one of those Saturday budget command supported by a large coalition of community organizations.,435,,
1923,0.97,12068.222,12075.863,And my office proposed a proviso for this project.,435,,
1924,0.97,12075.863,12082.837,Councilmembers before using a budget act to pay for it and I'm happy to make that change for the form B.,435,,
1925,0.97,12082.837,12101.722,"After the Mayor submitted her budget, from which everything I have seen, hasn't provided funding for the crossing, we hear that the Department of transportation has told community members that they would build the safe Street crossing this coming year so this would be a good way to hold the Department and the Mayor accountable to actually do it.",435,,
1926,0.97,12101.722,12108.83,"But I would say is that one way or another, any further delay would be unacceptable.",435,,
1927,0.97,12108.83,12124.612,"The Longhouse was visited by 10,000 people every year and to be Frank, after 11 years since the Longhouse was open, the fact that there is no safe Street crossing shows a shocking Underinvestment and disregard for communities of color.",435,,
1928,0.97,12124.612,12134.822,"Councilmembers, if I may, this may fall into the category of portions of it may have been pulled into the Reconnect West Seattle project as well.",436,,
1929,0.97,12134.822,12140.361,So I have to do a little research and see how that plays out.,436,,
1930,0.97,12140.361,12147.001,Councilmember Herbold.,437,,
1931,0.97,12147.001,12148.336,Thank you.,438,,
1932,0.97,12148.336,12150.037,I appreciate Councilmember Sawant bringing this forward.,438,,
1933,0.97,12150.037,12170.892,"At the September 23rd meeting of the West Seattle bridge community task force meeting chaired by former Mayor Nichols, Colleen Lopez, Sdot answered questions regarding the particular project that I and others asked.",438,,
1934,0.97,12170.892,12182.87,And we have been told that this project is fully funded through the funding adopted by the council as part of the West Seattle bridge Reconnect West Seattle plan bond sale.,438,,
1935,0.97,12182.87,12187.308,The plan is to add a temporary signal next year with a permanent one the following year.,438,,
1936,0.97,12187.308,12200.688,And understand that this may not have been included in the CIP description due to the timing of the Council's vote on the Interfund loan.,438,,
1937,0.97,12200.688,12213.434,"And when the proposal was completed, I think it would be great for Calvin to confirm this and writing.",438,,
1938,0.97,12213.434,12226.714,"And again, I'm optimistic that we are going to hear that Sdot is responding to the community need for this project.",438,,
1939,0.97,12226.714,12227.014,Okay.,439,,
1940,0.97,12227.014,12227.548,Thank you Councilmember.,439,,
1941,0.97,12227.548,12228.115,Councilmember Sawant.,439,,
1942,0.97,12228.115,12244.732,"As I said before, we have been hearing from the community that Sdot is said they would do this and I appreciate the information shared by Councilmember Herbold and the staff.",440,,
1943,0.97,12244.732,12254.141,We will be connected with central staff to make sure this is happening.,440,,
1944,0.97,12254.141,12262.85,"After so much of a delay, a proviso doesn't hurt and it would be a good way to hold the Mayor accountable.",440,,
1945,0.97,12262.85,12269.457,Can you say that last sentence again?,441,,
1946,0.97,12269.457,12284.372,"I also think after an 11 year delay and given that people are facing dangers literally when they are crossing the road, that a proviso doesn't hurt and it will help us check on that.",442,,
1947,0.97,12284.372,12285.339,Thank you so much.,443,,
1948,0.97,12285.339,12285.806,Thank you very much.,443,,
1949,0.97,12285.806,12290.711,I don't see additional questions on this.,443,,
1950,0.97,12290.711,12292.246,"Calvin, I believe we have reached the end of your presentation.",443,,
1951,0.97,12292.246,12297.284,Do you have anything else to add to this?,443,,
1952,0.97,12297.284,12303.591,I don't know if we want to do any closing remarks.,444,,
1953,0.97,12303.591,12304.091,"Thank you, Calvin.",445,,
1954,0.97,12304.091,12308.195,I don't have anything except congratulations on staying on schedule.,445,,
1955,0.97,12308.195,12314.035,That makes me happy.,445,,
