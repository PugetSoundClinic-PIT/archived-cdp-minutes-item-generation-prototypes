242,0.97,1364.529,1377.642,I am a Renter and I just want to say it is totally unacceptable that the Councilmembers are walking back there promised to Defund by 50% and that they would propose a ridiculous 4% Defunding plan.,70,,
243,0.97,1377.642,1383.715,I want to be clear that they are not supporting--the Council members do not want to Defund either.,70,,
244,0.97,1383.715,1402.267,"They are just buying their time and making excuses and I want to thank Councilmember Sawant for standing with the movement and urge Councilmembers to vote to uphold the cuts to the bloated Seattle police executive budget where some police officers are making 200,000 or more a year.",70,,
245,0.97,1402.267,1412.711,I think it is ridiculous.,70,,
246,0.97,1413.879,1416.281,We are not paying teachers that much and it is absolutely unacceptable.,70,,

250,0.97,1424.389,1434.332,"My name is CJ and I am a Renter in district 6. this weekend, I got a call from my Uncle from North Carolina saying that him and his friends signed a petition on Fox news and people are trying to influence our city of policies.",72,,
251,0.97,1434.332,1441.139,We want to urge that you don't let outsiders influence your decision.,72,,
252,0.97,1441.139,1444.509,We have been showing up for a long time and we need to listen to that.,72,,
253,0.97,1444.509,1450.949,Some of the officers are making upwards of 300 grand a year and facing no punishments for misconduct.,72,,
254,0.97,1450.949,1458.657,We don't want those people protecting us.,72,,
255,0.97,1458.657,1466.264,The call to Defund the place is clearly here to stay.,72,,
256,0.97,1466.264,1466.665,Thank you.,72,,
257,0.97,1466.665,1473.972,"Okay, thank you very much.",73,,

259,0.97,1476.174,1484.082,"We have reached the 11:00 time period and we will have full council this afternoon at 2 PM if you would like to make public comments, that begins at 12 noon.",73,,
260,0.97,1484.082,1500.799,"With that, that begins for this morning and we will get to the orders of business in front of us and given that this is a continuation of the conversations we've had over the last few months.",73,,
261,0.97,1500.799,1505.804,We have been working on the budget process now for over two months and I want to thank our incredible team and central staff.,73,,
262,0.97,1505.804,1516.214,I know I was on the phone all over the weekend trying to prepare additional last-minute ideas and making sure that all of the Tees were crossed and eyes were dotted.,73,,
263,0.97,1516.214,1518.216,Thank you to all of you for your work.,73,,
264,0.97,1518.216,1526.925,This is not a process that we engaged in lightly and or did we engage in a manner that was rushed.,73,,
265,0.97,1526.925,1542.24,This was a thoughtful process to address the crisis that is presenting itself because of Covid with the decreased revenue and impact on the health and economic viability of our community.,73,,
266,0.97,1542.24,1545.043,I did just want to say thank you for all of your work.,73,,
267,0.97,1545.043,1549.114,This is slated to be the last committee meeting and then we have the opportunity to have full council.,73,,
268,0.97,1549.114,1594.659,"I did want to take a quick second to address the letter that we received last night at about 10 PM, I had the chance to talk to the director and 12 hours later at 9 am, the Mayor's and the information and Email that the Mayor sent RAISES some concerns about the Jumpstart Seattle revenue proposal 20 minutes before the Council briefing was slated to start so I appreciate trenches questions and I think the intent is to make sure that we have a robust discussion on Wednesday as slated regarding the use of emergency funds both with the rainy day funds and emergency funds though there is a conversation to be had about the reserves and how we can identify how to get that out the door to address the pressing issues in our city.",73,,
269,0.97,1594.659,1617.382,I will not be engaging in a conversation that puts city services against those that are in desperate need of the Covid dollars and those that are seeking child care and rental assistance and food assistance and folks that need to open their small businesses and are looking for flexible funds.,73,,
270,0.97,1617.382,1630.228,The child can that 70 business owners and Seattleites across Seattle have said that they need to have access so the doors can go into Childcare and submit those services to stay open.,73,,
271,0.97,1630.228,1640.138,We've heard from 9 to 5 that there are so many small businesses and 30% of which are slated to stay closed unless they receive immediate assistance right now.,73,,
272,0.97,1640.138,1666.164,"I know for example that my sister who has my young nephews, her kid that was slated to go to second grade is now at this point planning to go to a Childcare that is adapting so more Kiddos can have a place where they can be during the day and learn and they can be safe while schools are closed.",73,,
273,0.97,1666.164,1672.37,It's important that we offer that support and not just to families but to small businesses and Childcare across the city and that is what this is slated to do.,73,,
274,0.97,1672.37,1686.317,We will have a robust conversation about the Jumpstart Covid relief bill on Wednesday and I think there will be ample time with the inflation we have received about the shortfall in the revenue.,73,,
275,0.97,1686.317,1688.653,It's no secret that we anticipated a quick recovery and slow recovery.,73,,
276,0.97,1688.653,1714.479,"There is a V shaped recovery and U shaped and as you can imagine, we are in the slower you shaped recovery because folks have not been able to go back to school and have not been able to open school businesses or resume business as usual because it is imperative that we protect their health and safety I maintaining and continuing stay home stay healthy orders.",73,,
277,0.97,1714.479,1721.72,It's no surprise that there is a slower recovery and it is tracking along with the slow recovery strategy that was outlined in June.,73,,
278,0.97,1721.72,1727.826,What is the surprise is to receive a letter 30 minutes before a Council briefing.,73,,
279,0.97,1727.826,1737.035,I think this speaks to our need for robust engagement and what the budgeting practices could be in the city.,73,,
280,0.97,1737.035,1771.736,I know there will be ongoing conversations later today in the budget committee setting out guidelines or principles of ways we would like to engage more Collaboratively and Transparently with the public by having information presented from the city budgets office to city Council and the public in a transparent way and I would even suggest that includes regularly timed revenue so that we are not receiving information 12 hours before a slated vote.,73,,
281,0.97,1771.736,1778.576,"Like it or not, we are our old full range of government and our job is to appropriate money and do so Transparently and that is what we have been engaged in doing.",73,,
282,0.97,1778.576,1788.787,We want to make sure that the folks in the community know that we are engaged in the conversation and Ideally anticipate having a robust discussion on Wednesday about the relief funds.,73,,
283,0.97,1788.787,1793.958,"We will as we always have, continue to work with the Mayor to identified solutions and we will do that this week and into the fall.",73,,
284,0.97,1793.958,1804.002,We have a full budget process in front of us that begins just in September and we will be looking for ways to make sure we close any of these.,73,,
285,0.97,1804.002,1839.137,"Councilmembers, I wanted to identify that what is most important for the next two hours is to include this conversation about the budget and we will have additional conversations but we have a number of amendments that are in front of us and we are very close to the finish line with getting these wrapped up and as Councilmember Herbold noted, there are ongoing conversations to be had regarding the emergency relief dollars because we have that bill Teed up to discuss Covid relief.",73,,
286,0.97,1839.137,1842.64,"With that, I would encourage us to make the tough decisions that we have in front of us.",73,,
287,0.97,1842.64,1859.123,We have come a long way as a Cohort and we have an incredible amount of work that has been put into identifying the 2020 rebalancing package thanks to the incredible teams within our individual offices.,73,,
288,0.97,1859.123,1866.564,"We have sought professional work that has guided our budget to date and with the new information that we have received, we will continue to engage with the executive's office about how to close the gap.",73,,
289,0.97,1866.564,1893.191,"As our budget director noted three weeks ago or so, given the slower anticipated recover, we had identified an $11 million gap so we will continue to see a slow recovery but it is imperative for us to continue to move forward with this light budget committee to wrap up our discussions on the proposed package.",73,,
290,0.97,1893.191,1896.194,None of this is easy and we are all moving as fast as we can.,73,,
291,0.97,1896.194,1926.124,I know the city is not in a unique position as we grapple with the impact on reserves and revenue as well as the pressing need in our community with what is unique in the city and it is the extremely aggressive nature and that is why we passed the payroll tax to help replenish in full our emergency reserves beginning next year with the amounts that will be allocated or collected at the end of 2021 and replenished in 2022.,73,,
292,0.97,1926.124,1935.433,It is a two-part process but trying to be Proactive about the Regressive nature and that is why we passed the Jumpstart package.,73,,
293,0.97,1935.433,1952.75,I would love for us to jump into the conversation about the members in front of us and then finish the conversation in a robust fashion about what to anticipate throughout the rest of the week later in our conversations today.,73,,
294,0.97,1952.75,1961.125,"With that, Madame clerk, will you please read into the record item number one.",73,,
295,0.97,1961.125,1963.861,Are you on hold?,74,,
296,0.97,1963.861,1973.071,"I'm sorry, are you on mute?",74,,
297,0.97,1973.071,1974.439,"There we go, excuse me.",75,,
298,0.97,1974.439,1979.544,"Agenda item 1, review of the potential a decision related to Seattle police Department for briefing and discussion.",75,,
299,0.97,1979.544,1988.886,Thank you very much.,76,,
300,0.97,1988.886,1998.196,"Colleagues, we have in front of us the review of potential a decision related to the SPD budget and I will turn it over to Allie that I believe has a chart to show us and then we will look at legislation in front of us.",76,,
301,0.97,1998.196,1999.864,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",77,,
302,0.97,1999.864,2026.224,"My colleague, Patty is posting a list of four pieces of legislation that are on the introduction and referral that are needed to implement some of the changes proposed today and discussed in this committee as well as the resolution that I will discuss once I briefly described those four pieces of wood decision.",77,,
303,0.97,2026.224,2035.433,We first have a .89861 which would aggregate the Seattle police Department's control operations so that appropriations for each precinct are controlled separately.,77,,
304,0.97,2035.433,2045.243,Councilwoman 9860 would amend the Jumpstart relief bill to reduce the total amount of spending by the million dollars.,77,,
305,0.97,2045.243,2083.948,Councilwoman 19862 would appropriate that $3 million to the alleged Department to enter into contact the research processes that will promote public safety by community needs and Council bill 119863 authorizes a loan to support the investments in the councils work Reimagined accurately safety and the investments that were approved through amendments to Councilwoman 9825 last week to provide funding in the human services Department for this community led work.,77,,
306,0.97,2083.948,2091.889,"As I noted, these bills were discussed last week and in previous discussions.",77,,
307,0.97,2091.889,2108.106,It was determined that the budget changes required new Legislations so they will be introduced this afternoon and considered at the special council meeting on Wednesday afternoon.,77,,
308,0.97,2108.106,2110.908,"Unless there are questions about those bills, I will move to the resolution.",77,,
309,0.97,2110.908,2118.883,Any counselors that would like to speak to any of these bills that are in front of us?,78,,
310,0.97,2118.883,2120.017,"Okay, seeing none, please go ahead.",78,,
311,0.97,2120.017,2132.83,"So, the fit piece on this list is resolution the 1962 sponsored by Councilmembers Lewis, Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Juarez.",79,,
312,0.97,2132.83,2148.546,That will be at the counseling this afternoon and this resolution establishes the intent to create a civilian led Department of community safety and violence prevention and what is excited to occur in 2021.,79,,
313,0.97,2148.546,2154.752,I colleague is available if counselors have specific questions about the content of the resolution but for now I will turn it back to the chair and sponsors for further discussion.,79,,
314,0.97,2154.752,2155.653,Thank you very much.,80,,
315,0.97,2155.653,2160.925,"I want to thank Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Herbold, I believe they are the sponsors on this.",80,,
316,0.97,2160.925,2166.464,Would you like to speak to this document and what you have outlined in terms of the resolution that addresses 2020 and future work?,80,,
317,0.97,2166.464,2171.469,I think this is a really important element of the work we are doing today.,80,,
318,0.97,2171.469,2172.37,"Councilmember Lewis, take it away.",80,,
319,0.97,2172.37,2173.07,Thank you.,81,,
320,0.97,2173.07,2186.951,"I will be brief because I did discuss this and our going Council briefing but just of a matter fact, we are engaged in a deductive process in talking about the police Department.",81,,
321,0.97,2186.951,2205.87,There is an added opponent of what we are discussing as a community and how we make sure there is someone on the other end of the 911 response when people call 911 request and some kind of assistance.,81,,
322,0.97,2205.87,2219.483,"We have seen from the deliberations with the police Department and the data that has been shared that 56% of the 911 calls, SPD is currently responding to our noncriminal calls.",81,,
323,0.97,2219.483,2232.196,Those calls represent a variety of public health and low level kinds of activity that could be addressed by a different type of first Responder.,81,,
324,0.97,2232.196,2247.044,We have also seen a considerable number of functions within SPD that the committee has expressed an interest in maintaining the service but we are moving it from the chain of command and a good example of that is a 911 dispatch.,81,,
325,0.97,2247.044,2285.85,"Given the Confluence of providing new Community-Based forums and first response and transferring certain functions out of the police Department, it makes sense to follow the lead of what other jurisdictions and cities are doing to put the new functions and responsibilities into a civilian public Department that is separate from a sworn and armed police Department and this is a practice that Minneapolis is currently looking at and Denver already has one.",81,,
326,0.97,2285.85,2290.488,"Albuquerque, New Mexico is looking at a similar practice.",81,,
327,0.97,2290.488,2306.504,Other cities have done similar work to Reconstitute entire levels of how they do law enforcement and the Charter amendment created a new type of public service officer with similar concepts with low-level enforcement responsibilities.,81,,
328,0.97,2306.504,2335.199,This resolution is the first step in setting up the process to create this Department which will be comprehensive and will involve working with community and working with a broad range of Stakeholders and possibly even involving a charter amendment in November of that 2012 about where the people of Seattle would have the final say at the ballot box over adopting this kind of approach.,81,,
329,0.97,2335.199,2347.445,"With that, I don't have anything else to add except to thank you for being extremely diligent in putting this together on a tight Timeline and working with a variety of Council offices and providing feedback.",81,,
330,0.97,2347.445,2362.56,I surely want to thank Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Juarez as well as staff in both of their offices and my office for shepherding this through and I look forward to considering this.,81,,
331,0.97,2362.56,2369.5,This has to be part of the process of our defining conversation.,81,,
332,0.97,2369.5,2392.49,This is not just a deductive conversation but what will continue to provide services and number one response and enhance public safety in the city rather than diminish it as has been the narrative and that is completely not the tension of this Council.,81,,
333,0.97,2392.49,2406.57,"There are better ways forward and to deliver some of the services if we will have a community conversation about it throughout the rest of this year so with that, I have no additional comments.",81,,
334,0.97,2406.57,2407.505,Thank you very much.,82,,
335,0.97,2407.505,2411.809,"Councilmember Herbold, would you like to add to this?",82,,
336,0.97,2411.809,2478.375,"Sure, but really briefly, in addition to the points that Councilmember Lewis made about the intentions to create a new civilian led Department of community safety and prevention, I want to lift up the other commitments that the legislation makes for our conversations in 2020 moving into 2021 as it relates to the Department transfers of several functions of the police Department into other departments and some of these transfers are transfers that the Mayor and the chief have identified as priorities and particularly the agreement around the shared interest to transfer 911 and the commitment of the Mayor to deliver legislation to the Council and to do so before the end of the year.",83,,
337,0.97,2478.375,2499.096,The resolution also outlines what our goals are for the community led research with the budgeting efforts and also identifies what the councils priorities are for SPD response 2911 calls.,83,,
338,0.97,2499.096,2530.427,"Also, it identifies the councils interest to further De- Prioritize or continue prosecution of certain types of Misdemeanors that lead to bias policing and these are conversations that we are going to have moving forward with the goal of reducing the impacts of policing on black and Brown communities.",83,,
339,0.97,2530.427,2541.605,Impacts that have a long history of desperate impacts and that perpetuate injustice in our city.,83,,
340,0.97,2541.605,2574.238,The legislation and resolution also identifies the councils priorities for out of order layoff request asking the chief to make such a request to the public safety service Commission director and stop the community's desire that the chief would make these requests to the Commission director focused first on officers with multiple sustained complaints.,83,,
341,0.97,2574.238,2590.688,We will have continued conversations with labor relations on the Mayor's office and the chief to identify other possible higher priority reductions in patrol staff.,83,,
342,0.97,2590.688,2613.61,"Also, the resolution speaks to the councils commitment to have compliance with our cities Charter obligation and expectation that the chief would comply to maintain adequate staffing in every District of the city.",83,,
343,0.97,2613.61,2665.863,"As well as our expectation that the budget actions are under the supervision and review of the court as it relates to our obligations under the consent decree and Lastly, I want to echo Councilmember Lewis thanks to the inclusion from Councilmember Juarez and specifically call out a description of what that inclusion is and that is the councils priority to work to create a police misconduct Registry that is accessible to the public and this model's efforts that are being undertaken in Federal Government and I thank Councilmember Juarez for bringing this idea forward.",83,,
344,0.97,2665.863,2666.263,Thank you.,83,,
345,0.97,2666.263,2667.364,Thank you very much.,84,,
346,0.97,2667.364,2671.001,I will also appreciate Councilmember Juarez.,84,,
347,0.97,2671.001,2676.84,I want to clarify something that I said earlier.,84,,
348,0.97,2676.84,2681.979,Councilmember Juarez has been officially excused and she did ask for an excuse for today's meetings I want to make that clear for the record.,84,,
349,0.97,2681.979,2688.786,Are there any other comments or questions on the resolution in front of us?,84,,
350,0.97,2688.786,2695.693,Councilmember Sawant and then Councilmember Pedersen.,84,,
351,0.97,2695.693,2705.702,I will be voting yes on this resolution stating the councils hope to Defund the police in the future.,85,,
352,0.97,2705.702,2727.424,"However, my message to the movement is that we have to be clear that a nonbinding resolution stating the intent to study defining the police in the future, let me state that again, the intent to hope to study defining the police in the future is simply not a substitute for actually Defunding the police.",85,,
353,0.97,2727.424,2747.945,"The city council can pass resolutions all year long so why is it today when voting on the actual funding of the police, why is it now the time for the majority of the Council to have a vote or resolution stating these intentions?",85,,
354,0.97,2747.945,2786.216,"Our movement is clearly expected to accept the nice words about the future intentions as a fact that unfortunate, I believe that would be a serious mistake because we have seen what happens and in Minneapolis, the city council promised to change the city charter to totally reorganize the police Department and as socialists in Minnesota have predicted, rather than taking any action with the city's highest state of body, the city council have the charter Commission and Unfortunately, the charter Commission has said this is not possible.",85,,
355,0.97,2786.216,2787.151,That happened Wednesday last week.,85,,
356,0.97,2787.151,2798.829,"After all the pomp and circumstances of the Defunding promises, the Minneapolis Democrats are not Defunding the police.",85,,
357,0.97,2798.829,2854.151,"Yet, in Seattle, after my office have publicly pledged to fight for and stand for the movement to demand Defunding of the police by at least 50%, six other Councilmembers, all Democrats promised a Defund but are now in the process of voting and is happened last week, voted against reduction of the police budget by 50% as my office had brought forward an amendment which no other Councilmembers voted yes on on Wednesday so the Democrats are voting to reduce the police budget by less than 3 million and are adding 3 million to the police budget for the supplemental budget which has not come up yet but I will be speaking to that also.",85,,
358,0.97,2854.151,2862.759,"Last Wednesday as I said, I propose Defunding the police of 50% now and every other Councilmembers voted no saying the cuts cannot be done in November even though these reasons that are stated are not based in fact.",85,,
359,0.97,2862.759,2882.98,"In response to the idea that this cannot be done until November which I don't accept But even Hypothetically, accepting that, I also brought forward an amendment of Defunding the police starting in November that is starting on November 1 and no Council member even Amendedthat proposal.",85,,
360,0.97,2882.98,2898.495,"To be clear, Defunding the police is not an accounting trick.",85,,
361,0.97,2898.495,2901.365,Moving enforcement Beekeeping operations changed is not what the movement meant by Defunding the police.,85,,
362,0.97,2901.365,2913.543,"By defining the police, we mean ending the repression of our communities and we do not mean budget cuts but the opposite of that, we may take money away from where harm is being done and put it in the communities.",85,,
363,0.97,2913.543,2942.339,"I will be voting yes as I said on this resolution because I support the resolution but at the end of the day, Defunding the police and end of police violence will require a sustained and independently organized movement where we hold our leaders accountable and where we don't build alliances to those that do not stand true to its promises.",85,,
364,0.97,2942.339,2943.14,Thank you.,86,,
365,0.97,2943.14,2944.408,"Councilmember Pedersen, I saw your hands.",86,,
366,0.97,2944.408,2961.024,Also just note that the resolution in front of us was as a draft last month on Friday in July so I want to make sure that was also noted.,86,,
367,0.97,2961.024,2961.925,"Councilmember Pedersen, please go ahead.",86,,
368,0.97,2961.925,2963.026,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",87,,
369,0.97,2963.026,2971.768,This is regarding this resolution and I want to thank the sponsors of this resolution for for writing it for us at the end of July.,87,,
370,0.97,2971.768,3003.266,For then updating it today and particularly interested in section 5 which asks for additional information asking for a report on how the proposed layoffs what effect general redeployment and response times and that's very important to have this data well how things would change and I've heard the Statistic a lot about half of the 911 calls that are noncriminal.,87,,
371,0.97,3003.266,3012.609,I found another good metric to look at rather than the wrong number of calls is the amount of service time spent and priority one and two calls take longer.,87,,
372,0.97,3012.609,3025.622,It's posing a threat to life and priority to such as in progress property crimes totaling 71% of service time.,87,,
373,0.97,3025.622,3031.728,That means only 29% are lower priority than one or two so I wanted to point out that metric as well.,87,,
374,0.97,3031.728,3042.172,"Have a question for the sponsors, could you elaborate on a potential scenario for what happens to the police Department in the organizational chart on city government?",87,,
375,0.97,3042.172,3058.054,"For example, as a police Department, the revision would be housed within the new community safety Department or multiple scenarios that could occur.",87,,
376,0.97,3058.054,3069.866,"From my perspective, to your letter suggestion, there are multiple scenarios that could occur.",88,,
377,0.97,3069.866,3103.366,I am not considering a scenario where we do not require policing for clarification's sake but whether or not the policing function would continue to be under traditional police departments and all of the other Non- policing entities would be under the Department of community safety and violence prevention.,88,,
378,0.97,3103.366,3119.249,That is one model and the other model could include the smaller and more focused policing agency to be under that umbrella as well.,88,,
379,0.97,3119.249,3133.029,"I think these are all good questions and I'm sorry that in my overview of the resolution, I apologize for not lifting up Councilmember Pedersen's contribution to the resolution and that was my fault.",88,,
380,0.97,3133.029,3146.91,I really appreciate your inclusion of requesting the data for the impacts of reduced patrol staffing on police response times.,88,,
381,0.97,3146.91,3165.562,I think that is important and a number of calls may not be as meaningful as time to respond to calls.,88,,
382,0.97,3165.562,3199.296,"I could add briefly to that, Councilmember Pedersen, there are a lot of different examples around the country of arrangements like this and in Minneapolis that is currently working on something where the police Department would be a Bureau within the agency and Denver, Colorado has a system like that or they have a Department of public safety and police are like a Bureau within it.",89,,
383,0.97,3199.296,3207.003,"Still, with the chief that runs that Bureau but answers to a civilian director between them and the Mayor.",89,,
384,0.97,3207.003,3218.782,It could also be that we developed the system and having two public safety Chiefs under fire and a police chief.,89,,
385,0.97,3218.782,3276.873,There would now be a third director of public safety and that would be the three public safety top officials with the independent departments to the Mayor and I think the important thing is to not be too descriptive because we do want to have an open process where we look at best practices and help with community experts to come up with what will be the best addition but there are multiple models and all them involve still having the ability to have armed police that can respond but just in a more specific role where there are other services I can take the role of things that police respond to and they currently should not be responding to.,89,,
386,0.97,3276.873,3280.977,I hope that provides Defecation.,89,,
387,0.97,3280.977,3311.474,"Are there any additional comments and this will be up for discussion and a vote in full council . Okay, I just want to thank the sponsors as well and offer document I have as we think about the next Iterations here.",90,,
388,0.97,3311.474,3346.242,"I want to appreciate the sponsors for bringing this resolution and Patty if you would like to bring up the document, I think this is a competent entry piece that goes along with the resolution to make it clear that there are actions being taken that will be able to be analyzed as we begin discussions in a few weeks and there are Significances that we are taking in this budget and if continued, this will result in both reductions and opportunities for us to invest in the community and this is the opportunity to show that chart have provided for last month and to show it is possible.",90,,
389,0.97,3346.242,3362.058,"If you Scroll to the top, we have seen that the rebalancing package is going very far and as far as we can but not as far as we know that the community is asking us to.",90,,
390,0.97,3362.058,3373.369,The teams have a working Around- The-Clock to identify all the places to reduce the Footprint and there are strategies that we put into place that can help us in that cycle to elaborate and analyze these costs.,90,,
391,0.97,3373.369,3383.98,We knew we had to make investments now so that solutions have the time to scale up and to take larger volumes for the future.,90,,
392,0.97,3383.98,3389.319,Today is one step in this process.,90,,
393,0.97,3389.319,3414.978,"Additionally, what lies in front of us is the opportunity to vote on the research process that will begin later this year to make sure that decisions are rooted in equity and reducing funding but making sure we are investing in community led solutions and we are dressing things in the criminal legal system and calling for change there.",90,,
394,0.97,3414.978,3416.746,We have to be intentional as we move forward.,90,,
395,0.97,3416.746,3432.896,This is a document that is intended to be Aspirational and intended to be a point in time analysis for where there could be further the Prioritization and that will be baked into the conversations and discussion in the fall cycle.,90,,
396,0.97,3432.896,3445.742,"Again, not to be too prescriptive but to show how serious considerations are being penciled out for us to consider for the full council in the budget deliberations this fall.",90,,
397,0.97,3445.742,3445.942,Inc.,90,,
398,0.97,3445.942,3446.643,"You very much, Patty.",90,,
399,0.97,3446.643,3460.056,This goes to the full resolution in front of us just to show that there has been a lot of work and research done to think about how we can move forward with the 20-21 visualization of a Columbus in some priorities that are outlined.,90,,
400,0.97,3460.056,3460.59,Councilmember Herbold?,90,,
401,0.97,3460.59,3462.659,Thank you so much.,91,,
402,0.97,3462.659,3480.043,Is there a way for staff to show both sides of the document on the screen together?,91,,
403,0.97,3480.043,3483.48,I think that can be accomplished or we can shrink it if that would be helpful.,92,,
404,0.97,3483.48,3489.853,"I think for the viewing public, I would like to emphasize one of the points that you have made, chair Mosqueda.",93,,
405,0.97,3489.853,3506.669,I think sub totaling or adding the two first Subtotal categories is really important to understand the value--that will work.,93,,
406,0.97,3506.669,3527.323,"Sub totaling the 10.5 million plus about 53 million and those two categories are pretty accurate Quantification of the value, perfect, thank you.",93,,
407,0.97,3527.323,3541.204,A value over the course of the year of the votes that we are taking now for the last 4 1/2 months of the year.,93,,
408,0.97,3541.204,3548.912,Thank you chair Mosqueda for putting together this document.,93,,
409,0.97,3548.912,3551.748,I really apologize because I know we have talked about it a lot.,93,,
410,0.97,3551.748,3571.467,It is occurring to me that we are also voting to take the proposed Demonstrator reductions in the Mayor's police budget and we are voting to make them required reductions and are they on this document?,93,,
411,0.97,3571.467,3579.275,You are correct and they are currently listed under the first item under additional cuts for consideration.,94,,
412,0.97,3579.275,3588.985,"I think I know where you are headed with that and given this is a point in time draft to pull that up, we can definitely do that and circulate that to folks.",94,,
413,0.97,3588.985,3608.805,"Also, happy to include any additional feedback but this is the purpose for us to have a menu in front of us and we did want to identify the cases where we are voting today through our actions and identifying those commitments that are being put in the resolution so your point is very well taken.",94,,
414,0.97,3608.805,3632.628,I think the things that I am thinking about as the starting point for the September budget discussions are all of the things under reductions and transfers and those things should not be in the proposed budget coming out of the Mayor's office because we have already made these decisions.,95,,
415,0.97,3632.628,3653.182,"So, I think conceptually, and thinking of this as the starting point as a reduced 20- 21 budget of about $75 million.",95,,
416,0.97,3653.316,3657.52,I think that is my rough math of that.,95,,
417,0.97,3657.52,3658.554,"Perfect, that is right.",96,,
418,0.97,3658.554,3686.182,"Thank you for the feedback and again, just a point in time reference to some of the items that we are Actualizing and items that could be annualized next year into the fall budget and items for future conversation and discussion that would also yield additional reductions to free up solutions for community led processes.",96,,
419,0.97,3686.182,3686.682,"Thanks again, Patty.",96,,
420,0.97,3686.682,3692.488,"Seeing no additional comments or questions on the resolution in front of us, Councilmember Pedersen, please go ahead.",96,,
421,0.97,3692.488,3693.089,Thank you.,97,,
422,0.97,3693.089,3694.891,I just want to understand the attachment.,97,,
423,0.97,3694.891,3706.302,That was not circulated earlier and I just wanted to understand the meaning of that.,97,,
424,0.97,3706.302,3734.797,"There are lots of things that I like about resolution 31962 and the enumeration or list of Aspirational reductions, that is something that I think would require more time to get comfortable with so I wanted to be clear that a son votes in favor of resolution the 1962 that they are not necessarily voting in favor of those reductions.",97,,
425,0.97,3734.797,3738.601,I is correct.,98,,
426,0.97,3738.601,3740.436,"Councilmember Herbold, did you have any data back?",98,,
427,0.97,3740.436,3767.029,"No, just that we have this conversation about whether or not it would be part of the resolution and came to the conclusion that it is a good Visioning document that should not be part of the resolution.",99,,
428,0.97,3767.029,3767.83,"Okay, thank you.",100,,
429,0.97,3767.83,3769.232,Thank you for that clarification.,101,,
430,0.97,3769.232,3771.834,"Colleagues, I think that gets us to the first part of our agenda today.",101,,
431,0.97,3771.834,3772.869,Thank you for the discussion.,101,,
432,0.97,3772.869,3776.973,"Allie, let's go to item number two and Madame Claire, could you please read item number two into the record.",101,,
433,0.97,3776.973,3795.258,"Agenda and to, 119825, an ordinance related to the city response to the 2020.",102,,
434,0.97,3795.258,3804.667,There are seven amendments and a few options for three of the amendments so I will do my best to help walk us through these and highlight where there is only one choice.,103,,
435,0.97,3804.667,3841.137,The first amendment makes technical and clarifying amendments and this includes correcting reduction in the capital projects that was double counted and adding in the number for resolution the 1962 where it is Referenced in several and to remain in alignment with the consent decree and modify the wording in section 24 that includes what was proposed on command staff salaries as last week.,103,,
436,0.97,3841.137,3848.311,This would be on a specific amount of body rather than the entire police Department budget.,103,,
437,0.97,3848.311,3863.659,That is amendment B has posted to the agenda.,103,,
438,0.97,3863.659,3869.232,And this was amendment E-1 and B-2 . I will describe them and noticed that only one of the options can pass.,103,,
439,0.97,3869.232,3925.121,"The first option, amendment B-1 sponsored by Councilmember Lewis has the limits of B what would strike anywhere sections on command salaries in 2020 and number two, sponsored by Councilmember Gonzalez, Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Lewis has the technical clarifying corrections to the capital projects and the resolution number and amend the language in section 24 to modify how the chief salary would be restricted and decreases the total amount of the SPD budget that would be subject to reflect updated information that staff uncovered related to salaries.",103,,
440,0.97,3925.121,3938.434,The main difference is amendments B and B-Cat 2 would remove section 24 entirely.,103,,
441,0.97,3938.434,3941.137,I will pass it back to the chair and the sponsors for discussion.,103,,
442,0.97,3941.137,3963.726,"Okay, Councilmember Lewis, I see you are the sponsor of amendment be having 1 and I was a sponsor of American B which I will not go into detail because of the nature.",104,,
443,0.97,3963.726,3969.699,"Councilmember Lewis, would you like to start with an overview of any of the items in the removal of section 24 as you are proposing in amendment Be- 1?",104,,
444,0.97,3969.699,3976.872,"Procedurally, should I motion to move this amendment?",105,,
445,0.97,3976.872,3981.143,Do you mind if you just do it overview and I would like to hear from the sponsors.,106,,
446,0.97,3981.143,3981.978,It's pretty simple.,107,,
447,0.97,3981.978,4012.775,It would just have the pay reductions on the executive leadership team in the police Department.,107,,
448,0.97,4012.775,4020.516,"Councilmember Herbold, would you like to describe Be- 2?",108,,
449,0.97,4020.516,4067.129,"In addition to making the technical changes and it would prohibit spending $345,000 with BSL unless payment for employees with the remainder of the year and the reduction with the payment for the police chief position which is reduced and that is approximately $235,000 a year.",109,,
450,0.97,4067.129,4073.502,To the payment of the other command staff is reduced to the lowest hourly wage in each of classification.,109,,
451,0.97,4073.502,4090.786,"If the Department chooses to do neither or only one of these things, the police Department is required in the police Departent's budget.",109,,
452,0.97,4090.786,4109.705,"I think I will leave the speaking points and I think chair Mosqueda, you just wanted description right now so I will not make any argument right now for this particular position.",109,,
453,0.97,4109.705,4144.507,"Okay, recognizing that one cannot go with the other, Councilmember Lewis, did you still want to move amendment Be-1 because I for one could use more of a discussion about these and Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Lewis, I want to confirm that you have sent these to central staff was sufficient time to get them reviewed by law, is that correct?",110,,
454,0.97,4144.507,4145.14,I believe so.,111,,
455,0.97,4145.14,4154.65,"Yes, I can confirm that central staff has shared this version will fall and that is always the case because of that work with the law Department.",112,,
456,0.97,4154.65,4159.054,We have a different version of the amendment before us.,112,,
457,0.97,4159.054,4162.958,I see Karina nodding along.,113,,
458,0.97,4162.958,4170.266,Can we do more discussion about these two if that sounds okay to the sponsors?,113,,
459,0.97,4170.266,4175.738,"Sure, do you want us to discuss them of formally moving them?",114,,
460,0.97,4175.738,4176.171,Yeah.,115,,
461,0.97,4176.171,4186.482,"If you can do that, that allows us to have a discussion and if there is an indication that we are getting clarity on how these two align.",115,,
462,0.97,4186.482,4206.368,My understanding would be and maybe central staff to clarify and I'm happy to have a discussion with the other one of them.,116,,
463,0.97,4206.368,4210.206,"If Be-1 passed, it would make any other amending of section 24 irrelevant because it would be completely gone.",116,,
464,0.97,4210.206,4246.408,"It makes sense to vote on Be-1 first because it would make Be- 2 moved that in any event, I guess I'm happy to speak to section 24 after moving it in anticipation that we might move to vote but I guess it just seems like typically we Queue up the conversation when we Procedurally move an amendment for consideration.",116,,
465,0.97,4246.408,4252.448,"Since they are both in conflict, I also wanted to give a chance for folks to have a discussion since this is the first time we are having it.",117,,
466,0.97,4252.448,4254.383,"Okay, I'm happy to do it that way.",118,,
467,0.97,4254.383,4257.853,I just wanted to clarify but I am totally happy to do it that way.,118,,
468,0.97,4257.853,4263.459,I guess I will speak to section 24 on the merits rather than just background now.,118,,
469,0.97,4263.459,4277.473,"So, you know, bringing this amendment today is partly and obviously I want it to pass but it is also in the spirit of having a bit more of a discussion.",118,,
470,0.97,4277.473,4279.274,I did not speak on the amendment last week.,118,,
471,0.97,4279.274,4294.657,It was sponsored by Councilmember Sawant to lower the pay of the executive leadership team in the police Department and all the way down.,118,,
472,0.97,4294.657,4300.195,"You know, it's on the losing side of that vote so I wanted to bring it back to have more of a discussion.",118,,
473,0.97,4300.195,4326.021,It's not easy to bring it back because I have had a considerable amount of public disagreements with chief best and other members of the police leadership team but I do think it is also important as a matter of good public policy to have an approach to executive pay as we are putting a budget together.,118,,
474,0.97,4326.021,4338.0,I think the executive pay needs to be Reevaluated and especially in light of the budget shortfalls that we just got and it will be a really difficult year budget wise.,118,,
475,0.97,4338.0,4346.575,I think we should look at making sure that we have an executive pay structure that is not excessive in the city of Seattle.,118,,
476,0.97,4346.575,4352.848,I think it has to be comprehensive.,118,,
477,0.97,4352.848,4361.757,"I don't know right now, bring more analysis from central staff whether or not the executive pay of the police leadership team is excessive as compared to parents cities.",118,,
478,0.97,4361.757,4371.934,I don't know how we stack up relative to San Francisco or Denver where other cities of a similar size.,118,,
479,0.97,4371.934,4399.795,I also think it sends a strange precedent to just pick the police Department for reducing the top executive ban when we do have other departments with executive compensation and I want to give credit to Councilmember Sawant for being consistent and wanting to apply the same approach across all the executive departments.,118,,
480,0.97,4399.795,4403.766,She did bring amendments to do exactly that based on her analysis and her policy preferences.,118,,
481,0.97,4403.766,4421.884,"I have respect for that consistency but since I wasn't prepared to do this to every Department in the city to lower it, I don't see how I could in good conscience apply it just to the police Department.",118,,
482,0.97,4421.884,4426.188,Despite having massive disagreements right now with the police Department that I personally have.,118,,
483,0.97,4426.188,4432.694,I don't think that is consistent policy and I think there is a lot of collateral damage to that.,118,,
484,0.97,4432.694,4452.815,It's not just the chief or the sworn top command staff but also civilian staff that have been extremely helpful to this Council in developing are very intentional and detailed plans about how we will restructure public safety in the city.,118,,
485,0.97,4452.815,4463.158,And so so she has provided us all of the information the Council has requested and Dr.,118,,
486,0.97,4463.158,4487.282,"Chris Fischer who is presented at this council with the number one analysis and all the details we have requested as to the budget, their pay is getting cut by this amendment and I can't say that I have seen anything delinquent in their performance in responding to our request with candor and a quick and deliberate way.",118,,
487,0.97,4487.282,4507.903,I don't see why the budget director of SPD should be treated differently than the budget directors of Seattle city light or Spu or other places that we are determined to be excessive.,118,,
488,0.97,4507.903,4523.151,It just doesn't seem like a consistent policy and I don't see why they should want reductions in their pay when I don't know if it is excessive or not a policy being consistently applied.,118,,
489,0.97,4523.151,4539.534,"I think we should be exploring in addition to the pay, even more ways to hold executive officials accountable.",118,,
490,0.97,4539.534,4545.34,The chief does not come up for Reconfirmation so we should maybe explore having the chief of police come before the Council for Reconfirmation like other Department heads do.,118,,
491,0.97,4545.34,4550.979,There should potential be confirmation for deputy and assistant chief level officials.,118,,
492,0.97,4550.979,4556.451,To be able to better hold accountable folks that are in those positions with considerable executive authority.,118,,
493,0.97,4556.451,4570.632,"In many cases, deputy directors become interim directors for a long period of time so I think it would make sense to expand the number of officials that come before the Council for that consideration.",118,,
494,0.97,4570.632,4624.486,"As it stands, I don't think this is an application of consistent policy and what I would like to see us do is take on executive pay broadly as a project in the budget committee in the fall and look into how to build a consistent policy through all executive departments that those cuts and reductions be phased in out of consideration and in fairness for some of these folks, they were offered this position and presumably had other positions they could've accepted and to quickly reduce the pay of one leadership team in the city does not seem like a consistent policy.",118,,
495,0.97,4624.486,4654.983,"I think we should look into this across all departments and I'm bringing this forward because I wanted to say my piece on this and if this amendment is not successful, I think the modification of section 24 that I cosponsored with Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Gonzalez accomplishes some similar policy goals but I worry about the precedent that we are setting and I just brought this forward so we can have this conversation.",118,,
496,0.97,4654.983,4655.717,Thank you very much.,119,,
497,0.97,4655.717,4657.719,"Councilmember Herbold, would you like to speak again?",119,,
498,0.97,4657.719,4660.122,I would just like to make a point of order.,120,,
499,0.97,4660.122,4661.623,What is your point of order?,121,,
500,0.97,4661.623,4681.877,"I would just like the clerk to advise us because I'm not sure that if a Councilmember voted no and the no side lost in committee before, I'm not sure if Councilmembers could allow those no votes.",122,,
501,0.97,4681.877,4691.186,We passed this amendment 6-3 on the budget committee last week and Councilmember Lewis was one of the no votes.,122,,
502,0.97,4691.186,4700.595,"I question to the clerk is, is the counselor were allowed to bring it back in the budget committee?",122,,
503,0.97,4700.595,4708.904,"I think it can be raised in the full city council this afternoon but in my understanding that it cannot come again, I might be wrong about that.",122,,
504,0.97,4708.904,4714.676,Thank you.,122,,
505,0.97,4714.676,4728.423,"Madame clerk, do you have a quick answer to that question seven initially a quick answer because I'm not completely file with the policy language and whether or not it has already been voted on.",123,,
506,0.97,4728.423,4738.633,"I will have to verify that but if the member was already considered and it passed, the only way you could reconsider it is if someone moved to reconsider that if it did prevail at the meeting.",123,,
507,0.97,4738.633,4753.949,"At this point, if someone did want to reconsider the amendment, you have Councilmember Lewis cemented before you and that would be the next step that would need to happen.",123,,
508,0.97,4753.949,4757.752,"Allie, I saw you take yourself off mute and that I want to return to Councilmember Herbold.",124,,
509,0.97,4757.752,4772.067,The language in amendment B and section 24 was considered by this committee last week and it was the proposal to strike the amendment.,125,,
510,0.97,4772.067,4803.765,"If I am following and millions of eyes properly, I think what would need to happen is if any Councilmember that voted yes for the amendment that added section 24 last week would like to cemented to be reconsidered, you need to make a motion to reconsider and then you could move the proposed amendment.",125,,
511,0.97,4803.765,4804.399,"Is that correct, Amelia?",125,,
512,0.97,4804.399,4805.2,That's correct.,126,,
513,0.97,4805.2,4819.214,"We will let Councilmember Herbold speak because I think it is important to have this discussion about the two options in front of us and if they were to be someone that wanted to see amendment Be-1 advance, it would need to be so that was voting on the prevailing side last time and that would be so in the voted for the language in section 24.",127,,
514,0.97,4819.214,4833.228,"Just to have a robust round out, Councilmember Herbold, would you like to provide the information in The-2.",127,,
515,0.97,4833.228,4839.734,Thank you.,128,,
516,0.97,4839.734,4863.859,"I appreciate the opportunity to address this amendment and to say for myself that someone who was on the prevailing side of the vote on the ceramic, I feel in retrospect that I made an error and I did not have enough information about the impact of this vote as it relates to the police chief salary.",128,,
517,0.97,4863.859,4879.641,I appreciate that we are all trying to do a lot to address many needs was very compressed time to make decisions and collect information to make sure that our decisions reflect a full understanding of that information.,128,,
518,0.97,4879.641,4900.895,I for command pay cab without understanding that in doing so would result in this Council saying that the chief of police should be the second lowest compensated Department director in the city despite having the largest staff of any Department in the city.,128,,
519,0.97,4900.895,4921.016,"I learned that because after voting on the amendment last week, I requested information that showed the hourly rate of every Department and director in the city and what the hourly rate translated to any salary.",128,,
520,0.97,4921.016,4925.921,I voted for salary cuts to reduce salaries in the police Department.,128,,
521,0.97,4925.921,4932.227,Just one of several departments with outside salaries as Councilmember Lewis reminds us.,128,,
522,0.97,4932.227,4939.901,"And, Councilmember Sawant has consistently reminded us.",128,,
523,0.97,4939.901,4960.555,I also voted for the salary cuts to support the efforts to specifically reduce the size of the police Department but also to convey mine and the public's deep dissatisfaction with policing leadership of the last two months.,128,,
524,0.97,4960.555,4967.095,"As Councilmember Lewis mentioned, we have very little accountability over the police chief and this position is one of few that does not face Reconfirmation.",128,,
525,0.97,4967.095,4987.382,There was a prior attempt around 2008 to propose a charter amendment to correct that and proposed by Nick and required the police chief to come up for Reconfirmation.,128,,
526,0.97,4987.382,5011.106,I feel like our vote is to cut the chief salary by 40% or more than 40% and that puts the black woman that had to fight throughout her career including during the period of time when she was not selected by the Mayor's chief selection team.,128,,
527,0.97,5011.106,5019.08,"She has had discretion throughout her career and our action again would pay her at a lower level than almost all other Department directors, all except for one.",128,,
528,0.97,5019.08,5035.93,I don't want this Council to compound that past reality by allocating wages away that results in a massive cut in a Nontraditional sector.,128,,
529,0.97,5035.93,5049.844,"This would reduce the chief salary to $275,000 a year instead of how we voted last night which is $180,000 a year.",128,,
530,0.97,5049.844,5054.115,"And currently has a solid of $290,000 a year.",128,,
531,0.97,5054.115,5078.44,It's currently the third highest apartment in the city but moving her to the lowest would mean that the second lowest paid Department head despite managing nearly 2200 full-time employees as compared to 65 full-time employees in the Department of neighborhoods.,128,,
532,0.97,5078.44,5102.597,"Not only does the chief manage the largest Department in terms of FTE, again, it is important to get the background around the National search being passed over by the Mayor selection team and the fact that the community rallied to her cause.",128,,
533,0.97,5102.597,5102.997,Okay.,129,,
534,0.97,5102.997,5162.524,"Just a couple more things and I want to say to the folks that might say that it was our support that helped make her become the police chief, we don't care with last week's vote, this may be an act of disrespect to the black woman leader and the reason those folks might not care is because they feel and not only do they feel they have been respected or Disrespected themselves with misplacing inner-city but I'm saying I'm proposing is not only out of my sense of fairness that I understand you have not experienced at the hands of police but also from a concern and I want the fact that the city council voted to reduce the chiefs salary to the salary of the Department with far fewer staff to become the headline.",130,,
535,0.97,5162.524,5179.974,A headline that will be convoluted and mixed up with the movement to Defund policing and Seattle and distract us from following through on transforming policing and supporting community based alternatives to public safety.,130,,
536,0.97,5179.974,5218.012,"I do want to move us along and having voted on the prevailing side, organizing these issues are important and I think it would be important to talk about the institution in front of us and just to move the conversations along, I move that we move Be-2 . is there a second?",131,,
537,0.97,5218.012,5218.313,Second.,132,,
538,0.97,5218.313,5224.686,Is there any additional discussion.,133,,
539,0.97,5224.686,5244.072,I just want to acknowledge that I totally respect the rules on the able to move Be-1 and I appreciate being able to say my piece on this and I certainly support the passage of The-2.,134,,
540,0.97,5244.072,5245.139,Thank you very much.,135,,
541,0.97,5245.139,5245.807,Any additional comments?,135,,
542,0.97,5245.807,5252.914,I see the Council President.,135,,
543,0.97,5252.914,5268.529,I just want to strongly signal my commitment to doing the work that Councilmember Lewis described in his argument for a moment Be-1 which is not being moved currently.,136,,
544,0.97,5268.529,5285.046,I do think it is important for us in due haste over the fall budget session that would you take a look more globally at salaries across the board.,136,,
545,0.97,5285.046,5305.099,We are headed towards even more difficult than we thought economic times and it does make sense for us to do an evaluation of that aspect.,136,,
546,0.97,5305.099,5320.581,I do appreciate the conversation and I certainly appreciate the highlighting to do this in a more Holistic way and I want to signal my interest and support in making sure that the Council does not lose sight of that pending body of work.,136,,
547,0.97,5320.581,5337.432,I will be supporting Be-2 as one of the sponsors and I look forward to figuring out how to chart a path forward as described by Councilmember Lewis on the broader issues that he identified in his argument.,136,,
548,0.97,5337.432,5339.834,Thank you.,137,,
549,0.97,5339.834,5344.105,"I'm sorry, Dan, did you have something you needed to speak on?",137,,
550,0.97,5344.105,5364.425,"I think what you will want to do is have B moved and that would introduce a series of technical amendments and then consider The-2 or Be-1, whichever one you would want to consider as an amendment.",138,,
551,0.97,5364.425,5365.226,Thank you.,139,,
552,0.97,5365.226,5374.669,We will get to that process in just a second.,139,,
553,0.97,5374.669,5378.673,My understanding is that Be- 2 is inclusive of amendment B.,140,,
554,0.97,5378.673,5385.38,I don't think we have to move amendment B and then amendment Be-2 but perhaps Allie is the one that may have drafted this or perhaps it was Karina.,140,,
555,0.97,5385.38,5400.495,"If you could confirm that Be-2 is inclusive of amendment B, that would be helpful and maybe we can get that procedure.",140,,
556,0.97,5400.495,5413.608,"That is correct, amendment Be-2 includes the same information as amendment B but further modifies section 24.",141,,
557,0.97,5413.608,5414.609,Anything else to add?,142,,
558,0.97,5414.609,5425.92,Can you confirm that we can consider that we do not have to move amendment B and can just move Be-2 since it is inclusive?,143,,
559,0.97,5425.92,5436.297,That is correct.,144,,
560,0.97,5436.964,5438.533,Only amendment Be-2 needs to be considered.,144,,
561,0.97,5438.533,5438.933,Exi.,145,,
562,0.97,5438.933,5440.401,We are on track.,145,,
563,0.97,5440.401,5444.272,Be-2 has been moved and Seconded and we had robust conversation.,145,,
564,0.97,5444.272,5446.641,We have Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Pedersen next.,145,,
565,0.97,5446.641,5449.043,Councilmember Sawant?,145,,
566,0.97,5457.585,5483.945,"Thank you, just to clarify for members of the public, I just want to let everyone know that this amendment, Be-2 is a different amendment then Be-1 so they could be on either side on one say and incidentally it has been moved by the council member on the prevailing side so just to make sure that everyone knows we are being consistent.",146,,
567,0.97,5483.945,5510.671,"Our people's budget movement and my office's proposal to reduce the pay of the command staff in the police Department would save $375,000 which could be directed to urgent community needs especially the Working- class communities and I am opposes the memo because it reduces the pay limitation that needs to be done for the pay of one of those 13 command staff and the police chief.",146,,
568,0.97,5510.671,5519.714,Our proposal to cut pay is nothing personal against any of the staff including chief best.,146,,
569,0.97,5519.714,5522.416,What we object to is the pay of these executives.,146,,
570,0.97,5522.416,5530.391,Nine of them are paid more than all of the 50 state Governors in the United States.,146,,
571,0.97,5530.391,5545.773,A recent national survey of major city police chief salaries put chief best pay at 45% above the national average of major city police chief salaries.,146,,
572,0.97,5545.773,5552.446,"A report showed that the average major city police chief was paid a total of $203,000 in total compensation.",146,,
573,0.97,5552.446,5568.563,"The proposed reduction would leave--at this moment passes, it would leave the salary at $235,000 a year for the remainder of the year and well above the average for major city police Chiefs.",146,,
574,0.97,5568.563,5595.556,This is simply a matter of taking the moment that we brought forward that six counselors with your son and a matter of taking resources of where they are not being used effectively and are being wasted because on balance and taking it away from those problematic functions to fund urgent community needs.,146,,
575,0.97,5595.556,5614.475,"And it is shocking that while working people are struggling to pay rent and to put food on the table and keeps it, the Council spent time debating whether or not it is right to review some of the salaries.",146,,
576,0.97,5614.475,5618.546,Not that it is not accurate to say that she best would be paid lower than other Department heads.,146,,
577,0.97,5618.546,5633.527,"The moment that passed for the last four months of 2020, it would move her pain from $294,000 to $258,000.",146,,
578,0.97,5633.527,5666.26,"Then, on January 1, the annual pay would snap back to the original extremely high level in the absence of the I find it unfortunate that they are using consistency as a reason to have brought these amendments forward.",146,,
579,0.97,5666.26,5686.747,Be one is not be considered right now because if you want to be consistent then I will be willing to bring the amendment voted no on which is--you said he would not support which is to reduce the salaries of all executives and that way you could be consistent.,146,,
580,0.97,5686.747,5695.389,I don't believe allowing the voter salary to be consistent.,146,,
581,0.97,5695.389,5709.003,I also find it unfortunate that Councilmembers are using identity to justify limiting chief bested voted salary.,146,,

584,0.97,5735.93,5752.246,On the basis of identity we cannot be justified in perpetuating police violence against protesters and black and Brown community members.,146,,
585,0.97,5752.246,5765.259,Cannot be Absolved with former Councilmember Harold his actions in allowing police violence to continue and voting yes on a racist police contract two years ago and he was in office cannot be Absolved.,146,,
586,0.97,5765.259,5772.833,We have to hold our actions to what benefits the vast majority of the black community.,146,,

591,0.97,5808.602,5824.318,I did say for her to use her position to bring about a change in the status quote would require her to fight against the entire establishment and from personal experience I know what that takes.,146,,

691,0.97,6614.574,6626.619,My interest in transparency here is to highlight that there are a lot of structural impediments to doing the things that community wants us to do.,170,,
692,0.97,6626.619,6660.053,We moved toward a proviso that what require monthly reporting and we through conversations with the law Department and our colleagues found that a proviso on the entire dipper it's budget through the end of the year in exchange monthly reporting requirements was not something that was Lamentable.,170,,

711,0.97,6771.765,6784.644,"There's been a lot of concern expressed in the public if we are going to Reallocate substantial dollars if there is going to be a change in the number of officers, what made that impact look like on the ground?",178,,
712,0.97,6784.644,6794.487,This would require a report on that . I believe that adjustments can be made in this round.,178,,
713,0.97,6794.487,6803.997,Adjustments can be made so response times do not get worse if we are sending officers mainly to the priority 1 and 2 calls.,178,,
714,0.97,6803.997,6830.623,This amendment--Councilmember Strauss had some ideas getting more detailed . With hoping our Headstone explained on parliamentary procedure the idea is that I would add a phrase to this amendment to provide additional detail.,178,,

726,0.97,6929.622,6950.443,It's my understanding that this language is being offered as an amendment because the sponsor did not get confirmation or was unaware of the confirmation the same language was included in the resolution that we addressed earlier.,184,,
727,0.97,6950.443,6954.747,It's my understanding we move forward with this amendment.,184,,
728,0.97,6954.747,6968.161,I can tell you that--I can confirm my staff did share that language with Councilman Peters--Peterson's staff.,184,,
729,0.97,6968.161,6982.508,I feel this is the Purgative to language that myself and Councilmember Lewis have voluntary included in the resolution that includes a lot of request for additional information.,184,,
730,0.97,6982.508,7008.801,"My hope was if the language that's included in 56 and now 50 6a, we have clarified to the statements we are making to this Cal this type of request is being requested and in the resolution we do not have to do this amendment on the dais if that's acceptable to Councilmember Strauss and Peterson.",185,,
731,0.97,7008.801,7013.339,Just to make sure we are clear as a body but it's been affected.,185,,
732,0.97,7013.339,7029.088,The reason it's warranted in both places is that what we are doing here is a proviso to a Council bill which has an immediacy to it and strength to it that I would prefer to have it in both places.,186,,
733,0.97,7029.088,7045.138,"The majority of concerns I've received from residents, if the Council will go ahead with these reductions, what is the plan and how will that look like--how will things look like on the ground?",186,,
734,0.97,7045.138,7055.548,This is making sure we've got Councilman and resolution and were going to get a bit for on what the impact will be.,186,,
735,0.97,7055.548,7059.051,Can you verbally summarize your amendment again?,187,,
736,0.97,7059.051,7088.881,"56 a which is in front of you would be adding a phrase to provide more detail . where it talks about how it would affect general redeployment and response time bite precinct ads with details including priority level, criminal versus noncriminal inclusion rates.",188,,
737,0.97,7088.881,7091.484,Does anyone on central staff have that language in front of them?,189,,
738,0.97,7091.484,7093.853,I do not have that language in front of me.,190,,
739,0.97,7093.853,7094.987,I'm the director of the amendment.,190,,
740,0.97,7094.987,7097.59,I'm taking notes.,190,,

745,0.97,7121.514,7124.984,The lack of being in person this would be sent in person.,192,,
746,0.97,7124.984,7129.522,Please repeat the language and you can repeat it back to us.,192,,
747,0.97,7129.522,7138.197,We have a handful of amendments we have to get through this is not controversial and tried to figure out if there's a faster way to accomplish this.,192,,

749,0.97,7140.233,7150.943,Adding to 56 a which is already before us is additional detail that another Councilmember was interested in having which I support.,193,,

755,0.97,7174.734,7179.672,I believe we have the language fom Councilmember Peterson from an Email.,198,,
756,0.97,7179.672,7209.602,"Just to be very precise, inversion 56 a that was distributed this morning, starting on page--this would be the budget reduction in the highlighted in yellow it would be what's being added to version 56 a verbally and we reflect it this afternoon.",198,,
757,0.97,7209.602,7221.414,There is also the addition of regarding the harbor patrol that it would say to the Seattle fire Department or other city departments.,199,,
758,0.97,7221.414,7228.921,It's been moved we add this language to 56 A. I will second it.,200,,

763,0.97,7246.405,7253.012,I think in general understand what the sponsors intent here.,201,,
764,0.97,7253.012,7292.985,I will flag that I am concerned about the meeting nature of the question . to me seems to imply that councils budget actions will have negative ramifications and seems to be--the language seems to be an invitation there could be a publicized report to the city council related to questions here.,201,,
765,0.97,7292.985,7297.59,I'm flagging I have a concern about a question that's frames.,201,,
766,0.97,7297.59,7304.563,I may be to focused on that.,201,,
767,0.97,7304.563,7343.502,"My preference would have been the question be more fairly posed . similar to other questions including things like--for example instead of saying how it would the layoffs affect, instead doing it as how does the Department intent to deploy these personnel modifications and or prior toys SIZING--Prioritizing calls to maintain responsiveness.",201,,
768,0.97,7343.502,7361.62,I'm flagging I have a concern related to that framing of the reports . and my anxiety about inviting a conclusion before evaluation is done.,201,,
769,0.97,7361.62,7366.258,Councilmember Stross?,202,,
770,0.97,7366.258,7369.562,Thank you for bringing this up.,203,,
771,0.97,7369.562,7372.965,I will admit to my colleagues I was the one going back and forth with Councilman Peterson.,203,,
772,0.97,7372.965,7399.792,I have Emailed back again . I'm wondering Councilman Peterson would you have interest in holding this addition and requiring a different report through the auditor or somewhere? I know I Emailed you back with additional questions and moving in a general direction with this information called out in other places.,203,,
773,0.97,7399.792,7401.694,I wanted to flood that question for you.,203,,
774,0.97,7401.694,7429.789,This amendment is important for me to support the Council bill . I will state for the record that the intent of this is not to invite any report that's in balance but to get at the court information.,204,,
775,0.97,7429.789,7438.664,Happy to change the language and say how it may affect general redeployment if that would help.,204,,
776,0.97,7438.664,7453.445,I wanted to state publicly is not the intent to encourage any reporting that's not accurate but to get to the heart of concerns that others may have in a community that changes may impact things.,204,,

780,0.97,7480.172,7482.074,Any additional conversation?,205,,
781,0.97,7482.074,7486.779,Councilman Strauss?,205,,
782,0.97,7486.779,7488.981,This is a question for you chair or the clerks.,206,,
783,0.97,7488.981,7508.2,Are we moving the language that I had in 56 version 2 or has the at been supplemented--supplanted by 56 a? Councilman Peterson spoke to changes to his language.,206,,
784,0.97,7508.2,7510.502,How does that work?,206,,
785,0.97,7510.502,7518.611,"If you can pull up the language in front of us regarding the amendment, the motion in front of us is making this verbal amendment to 56 a.",207,,
786,0.97,7518.611,7548.04,Then we would boat on 56 a--vote on 56 a as the sponsors have indicated that there is alignment with the language except willingness to accept 56 A. the question is whether this language will be adopted first before we consider the underlying language that was described inversion 3 with the addition of request.,207,,
787,0.97,7548.04,7548.641,Is that clear?,207,,
788,0.97,7548.641,7555.347,Will boat on this language first then vote on amendment 56.,208,,
789,0.97,7555.347,7562.755,The motion before you is to amend the version two of 56.,209,,
790,0.97,7562.755,7570.162,It would be amended as described in 56 a along with this additional breach.,209,,
791,0.97,7570.162,7577.97,"The first question is, do you want to amend the amendment that if that passes you would vote on the amendment as amended.",209,,
792,0.97,7577.97,7588.714,If it fails you would vote on the original version 2 of the amendment that was moved and second.,209,,
793,0.97,7588.714,7594.386,Can you put the language on the screen that has described amendment language?,210,,

795,0.97,7603.495,7633.425,"In the interest of us moving along, I want to speak to the fact that I will be supporting this language because it is very important to Councilman Peterson and it's important for us to move forward together and I've already agreed to including this language in the resolution that Councilmember Lewis and I discussed earlier in today's meeting.",212,,
796,0.97,7633.425,7647.973,I still believe it is Duplicative and the explanation for why the sponsor thinks it's not Duplicative seems to relate to a belief that 56 is a proviso.,212,,
797,0.97,7647.973,7649.041,It is not a proviso.,212,,
798,0.97,7649.041,7657.316,That's what I spoke to earlier when I explained we could not do a proviso on the rest of the year's budget.,212,,
799,0.97,7657.316,7663.789,"In the interest of moving us forward, this is the same thing which included in the resolution.",212,,

822,0.97,7846.638,7852.911,I moved amendment 57 two the Council bill.,221,,
823,0.97,7852.911,7854.246,Is there a second?,222,,
824,0.97,7854.246,7857.816,It's been moved and second.,223,,
825,0.97,7857.816,7859.585,Would you like to speak to your amendment?,223,,
826,0.97,7859.585,7861.92,I will make this brief.,224,,
827,0.97,7861.92,7875.868,When communication center program positions approximately five years ago the Seattle police Department hired an outside consultant to evaluate and make consulting on the 911 center.,224,,
828,0.97,7875.868,7887.079,One was adopted by the Seattle police Dpartment which was the Civilianization of the entire chain of command of the 911 center.,224,,
829,0.97,7887.079,7901.46,"During part to the fact that emergency communications have become a technical and software driven field, it is not realistic to expect captains, lieutenants and Sergeant who rotate every few years to truly manage such a complex operation.",224,,
830,0.97,7901.46,7912.437,The first step toward full civilization took lace in 2018 with three civilian managers were hired to take over the Day- to-day management of the communication center.,224,,
831,0.97,7912.437,7920.412,This has already greatly enhance the functioning of staff and operations.,224,,
832,0.97,7920.412,7932.424,The only two remaining positions which are sworn officers and which the consultants recommended to be civilian iced and AGREES to severe his eyes are the captain and the tenant assigned to the 911 center.,224,,
833,0.97,7932.424,7954.947,This Amendmet signal cities counsel's intent to create the position of director and deputy director of the 911 communication center as recommended by the independent consultant and agreed to by SPD and call for the Mayor to have it in the budget which will take up in September.,224,,
834,0.97,7954.947,7961.253,As we remove that and will one from the Seattle police Department full civilization is both prudent and timely.,224,,
835,0.97,7961.253,7964.356,Thank you for summarizing that.,225,,
836,0.97,7964.356,7973.031,I will NOTE Councilmember's one that you are interested in bringing back the overall question of the 911 in the fall.,225,,
837,0.97,7973.031,7981.573,Thank you for this comments and appreciate that discussion which we will be bringing up in a few weeks.,225,,
838,0.97,7981.573,7982.908,Additional comments or questions?,225,,
839,0.97,7982.908,7985.277,Councilmember swan.,225,,
840,0.97,7985.277,7999.591,One of the demands for George Floyd movement is to take the 911 call center of the control and chain of command of the police Department Unfortunately this budget amendment is the opposite.,226,,
841,0.97,7999.591,8011.603,It reinforces the bureaucracy over the 911 call operations within the police Department because the director and deputy director positions are being created within the police Department not in another Department.,226,,
842,0.97,8011.603,8017.209,We need to be clear that civilization does not equal moving it from police control.,226,,
843,0.97,8017.209,8026.284,The fact these positions are civilian is meaningless.,226,,
844,0.97,8026.284,8029.121,Who care if the managers of the police Department are sworn officers or not.,226,,
845,0.97,8029.121,8031.723,It's a question of what difference it makes.,226,,
846,0.97,8031.723,8041.733,For all purposes for this set up those two positions will still be part of the police chain of command.,226,,
847,0.97,8041.733,8049.841,I would be supporting this if it were concurrent with transferring a 911 of the police Department but it is not.,226,,
848,0.97,8049.841,8054.246,I will be voting no.,226,,
849,0.97,8054.246,8055.247,Thank you.,227,,
850,0.97,8055.247,8058.417,Looking forward to the conversation in the fall as this issue comes back.,227,,
851,0.97,8058.417,8061.353,Any other comments?,227,,
852,0.97,8061.353,8065.424,Those points were well taken.,228,,
853,0.97,8065.424,8077.035,"If there's additional language you like to see added to ensure it is clear the intent is to move this entire Department out of the Seattle police Department, I welcome that.",228,,
854,0.97,8077.035,8114.406,"I am committed along with many colleagues here at counsel to moving the 911 communications operation center out of the Seattle police Department . It is my understanding that it's important for us to take quick steps to improve and implement this transition as quickly as possible . If we have sworn officers in that Department, though sworn officers won't necessarily move as the entire 911 center is moved out of the Seattle police Department.",228,,
855,0.97,8114.406,8140.732,"If we are able to make the transition to having the civilian control and command of the 911 center today and this year, we will be able to transfer that more Holistically . My apologies if this came off as me trying to slow down, I'm doing the opposite move as quickly as possible to transfer that 911 center out of the Seattle police Department.",228,,
856,0.97,8140.732,8144.336,I'm not sure this will wrap it up.,229,,
857,0.97,8144.336,8170.662,I appreciate the intention of this amendment as proposed by Councilmember Strauss . I strongly agree with the observation made by Councilmember swan that we are assuming with passage of this amendment as written that the 911 center will be staying in the police Department.,229,,
858,0.97,8170.662,8177.769,Understanding chair your earlier expression for not wanting amendments On-The-Fly.,229,,
859,0.97,8177.769,8191.149,I wanted to see what it would be for striking out the words Seattle police Department so we can move forward on this amendment.,229,,
860,0.97,8191.149,8199.291,I see a thumbs up.,230,,
861,0.97,8199.291,8201.293,Do you wanNA make it a motion?,230,,
862,0.97,8201.293,8210.302,To we have--this is a new section 2 Council bill.,231,,
863,0.97,8210.302,8222.614,"I moved to amend the proposed new section two Council bill 1198 25 to strike the words, Seattle police Department.",231,,
864,0.97,8222.614,8226.284,It's been moved . is there a second?,232,,
865,0.97,8226.284,8226.685,Second.,233,,
866,0.97,8226.685,8235.026,Any additional discussion on the verbal amendment to amendment number 57?,234,,
867,0.97,8235.026,8236.628,Councilmember swan.,234,,
868,0.97,8236.628,8242.634,I have a question for alley.,235,,
869,0.97,8242.634,8254.145,I support not creating these positions inside the police Department but also not clear how you can create positions but not assign a department home for those positions.,235,,
870,0.97,8254.145,8256.948,I'm not sure how that would work.,235,,
871,0.97,8256.948,8259.751,Could alley respond to that?,235,,
872,0.97,8259.751,8269.861,I believe my colleague may be on the line . He may have more to add.,236,,
873,0.97,8269.861,8271.263,In general this is creating new positions.,236,,
874,0.97,8271.263,8293.952,I would suggest what would need to happen is we are creating the positions in the police Department right now in 2020 and should be adding language to say something along the lines that counsel expects with the transfer of 911 the 911 unit to another Department that should include these new civilian positions.,236,,
875,0.97,8293.952,8320.912,I may suggest we--you Councilmembers hold this amendment and give us half an hour to figure it out and take it up in a short hour and five minutes because I'm not saying with confidence it's reflect the--is doing what other Councilmembers have intended and need to confirm that.,236,,
876,0.97,8320.912,8323.114,As soon as that your thumbs up.,237,,
