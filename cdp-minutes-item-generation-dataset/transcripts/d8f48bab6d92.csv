143,0.97,838.204,849.515,"You know, last year, many in the city had no safe places to escape the toxic smoke from wild fires.",29,,
144,0.97,849.515,869.301,"As far back as 2016 the community research by got green found the wild smoke to be the top climate concerns of most impacted communities, and I think given all of this, we need to make sure that each neighborhood has safe spaces to build community resilience in the face of increasing threats like heat and smoke in Seattle.",29,,

153,0.97,891.223,924.456,"I am calling in in support of the solidarity budget priorities, and as a supporter of Puget sound, one of the things I would like to highlight to Council is allocating funding to close the gap between the low-income energy assistance programs we have, and their utilization by people who are qualified.",31,,
154,0.97,924.456,958.324,"Puget sound Sage was founded, unfortunately with wonderful programs through Seattle city lights that will help with energy upgrades, the reduced carbon Footprint and reducing their bills by decreasing the energy needed to heat or cool their home, a lot of people who are qualified for that program, they are not aware it exists, and they don't know how to apply or how to get the relief that they are--that has been made accessible to them.",31,,
155,0.97,958.324,974.673,"I am encouraging Council to please, this important program, so we ask have better community outreach so people who qualify for the low-income energy assistance programs know they are there, and the administrative barriers are as low as possible so we can help as many people as possible.",31,,

185,0.97,1117.783,1120.853,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda and members of the Council.,35,,
186,0.97,1120.853,1124.289,It's my honor to talk about the solidarity budget.,35,,
187,0.97,1124.289,1125.357,I recognize familiar faces here.,35,,
188,0.97,1125.357,1132.764,"I have interviewed many of you in the past, and I am impressed with the work you do.",35,,
189,0.97,1132.764,1136.502,It's time to step it up for climate change.,35,,
190,0.97,1136.502,1147.646,"I'm a freshman at the University of Washington, and as a young person, we are talking about our future, and my future when we talk about climate change.",35,,
191,0.97,1147.646,1152.718,"Instead of taking action, you're putting my future at risk.",35,,
192,0.97,1152.718,1155.721,Climate change is harder on lower-income communities.,35,,
193,0.97,1155.721,1164.029,They are often times more adversely affected by the climate change because of their circumstances.,35,,
194,0.97,1164.029,1171.236,In a cruel irony in the way in which we work to change the often times out of reach for those who are lower income.,35,,
195,0.97,1171.236,1177.242,"Something like solar power or electric cars may be great, but they are out of reach for Lower- income families.",35,,
196,0.97,1177.242,1180.712,"Let's be Frank, this problem was not caused by poor people.",35,,
197,0.97,1180.712,1184.349,It was caused by the rich and powerful.,35,,
198,0.97,1184.349,1196.528,Theburdens should not fall on the backs of poor people and should not face the scrutiny of not being able to pay for the expensive solution.,35,,
199,0.97,1196.528,1202.701,The solidarity budget addresses the issue directly and puts money towards making it equitable for all.,35,,

220,0.97,1271.036,1279.811,It should be the starting point for the budget negotiations this year.,42,,
221,0.97,1279.811,1289.187,The solidarity budget will close the gap from low-income energy assistance needs and the current use of the program is an important item that affects multiple homes.,42,,
222,0.97,1289.187,1298.363,The study by Puget sound Sage that energy efficiency programs are not being accessed by households that qualify.,42,,
223,0.97,1298.363,1303.635,They are not aware the program exists or do not believe they qualify.,42,,
224,0.97,1303.635,1316.581,"This hurts the low-income households forcing them to pay more than they should, and it blocks Seattle from reducing its carbon Footprint.",42,,
225,0.97,1316.581,1322.287,This would provide financial relief for the households that need the most and Redue the city's carbon Footprint.,42,,
226,0.97,1322.287,1322.587,Thank you.,42,,
227,0.97,1322.587,1323.255,I yield my time.,42,,

233,0.97,1335.167,1341.44,I moved downtown to walk as much as possible for my health and to reduce my carbon Footprint.,44,,
234,0.97,1341.44,1347.813,I have been recycling and doing everything throughout my life to help with the climate change problems.,44,,
235,0.97,1347.813,1357.122,I believe that this lifestyle is in jeopardy because Seattle and particularly downtown have become much less safe for like me.,44,,
236,0.97,1357.122,1362.127,The decisions you have made the last few years have made Seattle less safe.,44,,
237,0.97,1362.127,1373.238,I ask you respectfully to include in the budget adequate public safety dollars because we cannot continue to live downtown successfully if we are not safe on the streets.,44,,
238,0.97,1373.238,1373.472,Thank you.,44,,
239,0.97,1377.676,1381.98,Thank you very much.,45,,

250,0.97,1419.417,1443.508,"I am concerned about the budget because there's still a homeless crisis that has been going on for years, and the Mayor seemed to use the American rescue plan money, and I'm wondering did she still apply the city budget's original allocations in addition to or did she pull back on the city's allocations and just substitute the Federal?",46,,
251,0.97,1443.508,1457.122,There's an enormous amount of suffering from homeless people subjected to a lot of predatory criminals in Pioneer square between Yesler and Cherry Street and first Avenue where I live.,46,,
252,0.97,1457.122,1465.664,"Every single night I have lived here, for four months, there's an uncivil war being conducted by the evil criminals.",46,,
253,0.97,1465.664,1486.251,"There's a lot of homeless people suffering, and there's all these women that have been raped, and they are walking around with no shoes because the Dudes keep stealing all the clothes they possibly can, and all of these horrible screams, and I have called the cops over 50 times, and they refuse to come down here.",46,,
254,0.97,1486.251,1497.462,"There's a 7-Eleven across the street that SELLS to all of these messed up people who can barely stagger in, and they come out with more liquor.",46,,
255,0.97,1497.462,1504.069,"We need a better, Holistic investment in understanding who deserves to be invested in and who deserves to still go to jail.",46,,

257,0.97,1506.671,1508.84,There's no outreach down here.,46,,
258,0.97,1508.84,1538.136,"I see reach come down here, and they throw a five-minute guitar party with Pizza, hand out a small bottle of water, read from the Bible, and they disappear on the remodeling of the commercial real estate because they have money to buy a new vehicle, but they are claiming friends in the Encampments are suffering because they know their name.",46,,
259,0.97,1538.136,1551.149,"It seems like, no offense, city council is using the homeless crisis to pay off the activists, organizers, and they are not keeping them accountable.",46,,
260,0.97,1551.149,1551.75,We need an investigation --,46,,
261,0.97,1551.75,1554.352,"Thank you very much, David.",47,,
262,0.97,1554.352,1561.726,"I do see Yolanda was still listed to speak, but Yolanda, we did not see you dial back in.",47,,

273,0.97,1645.777,1653.385,"We are building on the foundation, colleagues that we have already laid over the last 18 months to construct a more equitable Seattle.",47,,
274,0.97,1653.385,1667.432,"In the next two months, while we may not agree on the substance of policies or budget decisions and the proposed budget transmitted this week, we do know so much work went into crafting the budget we are receiving.",47,,
275,0.97,1667.432,1674.139,"Thank you to the Mayor, her team and the city budget office for all they have done to provide the proposed budget in front of us.",47,,
276,0.97,1674.139,1686.851,"As I reflect on the last two years of being the budget chair, I think about how much has changed, the unprecedented times we are in, and how much work we have done to respond with urgency and compassion.",47,,
277,0.97,1686.851,1690.755,I think about how much about also remained the same.,47,,
278,0.97,1690.755,1699.964,"The crises, the public health crises we faced as a community remain here today, and our challenge is to address those with urgency and compassion as well.",47,,
279,0.97,1699.964,1704.035,The public health crisis we focus on today is Covid.,47,,
280,0.97,1704.035,1712.911,"The public health crises present before Covid were the lack of housing, the concerns around the community safety and policing, and racism.",47,,
281,0.97,1712.911,1715.78,That is still prevalent throughout our communities.,47,,
282,0.97,1715.78,1735.2,"These are public health crises we have tried to respond to with urgency over the last two years, and I think we have the opportunity today to begin the conversation about how the 2022 budget addresses the previous issues and the compounding issues from Covid so we are a truly more equitable and resilient Seattle in the outcome.",47,,

294,0.97,1822.02,1825.89,You have kept our city running helping folks to sustain and survive the crisis.,47,,
295,0.97,1825.89,1848.279,"It was my goal as the budget care coming in two years ago to really lead with transparency and accountability in our process, to ensure that the community understood what the budget proposals were, not only the proposal received from the Mayor, but they were engaged in the process over the legislative branch's efforts to try to create a proposed budget that reflects the community values.",47,,
296,0.97,1848.279,1872.737,"We wanted to make sure that departments knew they had the opportunity to have sustained funding for not only the calendar year in front of us, but moving forward as well in a standard budget, we would have passed the 2021 budget and have an endorsed budget for 2022, but due to Covid, we focused on the 2021 efforts in front of us.",47,,
297,0.97,1872.737,1891.155,"Today we look at 2022 with the opportunity to include the American rescue plan funds, jump start funding that you all passed in the implementation plan unanimously, and to be able to invest the critical resources in our community in the 2022 calendar year budget in front of us with a blank slate.",47,,

300,0.97,1905.637,1926.991,"We have built a transparent and more accountable process in the future as we look to work to stand up the revenue for the Council that will be forthcoming in the future years it will be a huge asset to the city to have the process baked into the city budgeting prior to receiving the proposed budgets, and to have accountable process for the community as well.",47,,
301,0.97,1926.991,1932.13,I want to thank our communications team.,47,,

303,0.97,1933.998,1941.906,We have a unified communication strategy to make sure each Councilmember has the ability to let the public know how to engage.,47,,
304,0.97,1941.906,1951.215,I have seen Councilmember have it on their newsletters and social media sites.,47,,
305,0.97,1951.215,1956.354,We will continue to do that as we craft the budget.,47,,
306,0.97,1956.354,1969.567,"What has remained constant throughout the pandemic is our focus and commitment on solving the most pressing needs in our city, addressing homelessness, public safety, public housing, supporting our most vulnerable workers and smallest businesses.",47,,
307,0.97,1969.567,1979.544,That's the task in front of us today as we begin our process of understanding what the proposed budget includes and crafting our Council's proposed budget for the community.,47,,
308,0.97,1979.544,1984.449,We are going to build on past investments.,47,,
309,0.97,1984.449,1996.027,"We will build on the documents started last spring, and we will make sure we have the opportunity to build on the foundation that you began laying with the passage of jump start last spring.",47,,
310,0.97,1996.027,2011.843,"Last spring over 100 organizations, thousands of people in the community, who have been calling for Progressive revenue for years came together around a proposal to invest in housing to make sure that homeless services were truly funded.",47,,
311,0.97,2011.843,2023.187,"We included immigrant rights organizations, housing advocates, labor unions, big and small business, Equity- based organizations, and environmental justice organizations to pass Jumpstart, and you all did that.",47,,
312,0.97,2023.187,2031.028,The policy that we passed is now generating with the renewed estimates over $230 million a year.,47,,
313,0.97,2031.028,2049.814,"We need this funding, as we knew back in the spring last year, we need the funding now more than ever to make sure we are investing in closing the gaps for investments in green new deal priorities, economic resilience, and most notable investments in affordable housing.",47,,
314,0.97,2049.814,2067.432,"At least $135 million a year was expected to go into affordable housing and homeownership opportunities and permanent supportive opportunities, and we know this is the most pressing issue facing our city, and I'm incredibly proud we passed that, and now we get the chance to build on that.",47,,
315,0.97,2067.432,2072.103,We also know that Jumpstart has been seen across cities across the country.,47,,
316,0.97,2072.103,2081.379,We have been able to point to the reliance on that funding to avoid austerity budgeting.,47,,
317,0.97,2081.379,2100.164,"This is something across the nation people have continued to look at Seattle as the way to avoid the Worst-Type of budgeting during an economic crisis, and I'm really proud of the work you all did, and I'm proud we had the chance to pass that as a team in just the last two years.",47,,
318,0.97,2100.164,2106.27,"I also see the Mayor even has assumed Jumpstart spending, even after vetoing the bill.",47,,
319,0.97,2106.27,2116.247,Excited to see they are celebrating the investment of what Jumpstart is making possible through the investments our city desperately needs with press releases as early as this week.,47,,
320,0.97,2116.247,2121.385,"That funding is making changes possible now, and we will build on the funding headed into 2022.",47,,
321,0.97,2121.385,2125.323,Budget that invested in public safety.,47,,
322,0.97,2125.323,2147.278,"We responded in the moment of crisis and a moment for a call for racial reckoning, by beginning to scale up investments in Community-Led safety programs, and beginning to truly invest in public safety that our community has been calling on for years, and we have the road map in front of us as we continue to right side our investments.",47,,
323,0.97,2147.278,2168.866,"Last fall, colleagues, we passed the budget that, again, restored the budgetary layoffs, invested in homeless programs, affordable housing and supportive services, and we made sure we fought to the future by including strategic acquisition of hotels, apartments, buildings, to create not only shelter, but long-term housing for the community most in need.",47,,

328,0.97,2205.536,2230.628,"The supplemental budget this September, and the American rescue act dollars passed the month prior are our ability to build on the foundation we started last year, layering in $128 million in deep investments in affordable housing, homelessness, community and small business supports and community well being with the Seattle rescue plan dollars, and we will continue to make sure we are investing in our economic resiliency of this city.",47,,

333,0.97,2263.561,2281.012,"If we don't act with urgency and compassion and lead with our values around protecting the most vulnerable, we will continue to see some of the worst effects of Covid manifesting in the streets with more folks calling into homelessness, and instability, and more small businesses close.",47,,
334,0.97,2281.012,2289.954,"We can try to correct that shift, and we have great partners at the Federal level and state level who have been stepping up to help support us.",47,,
335,0.97,2289.954,2295.893,"What Seattle is facing is not unique, but I think what is unique is the way we have been looked at to come together.",47,,
336,0.97,2295.893,2318.382,"We have come together in these trying times, and Seattle is unique in how we have built into our budget the community values, and Seattle is unique in how we are centering the budgets in the past two years, Espcially on addressing the most vulnerable and making sure those workers, those smallest businesses, and our most vulnerable are receiving direct assistance.",47,,

400,0.97,2796.36,2824.488,"It's the ongoing policy work the Council has been engaging in over the last year, and in previous years, and questions being asked of staff and other priorities we are aware of for the Council, and really as director handy highlighted, the use of certain funds and how to balance the community needs in this as we continue to work through the impacts of the pandemic.",53,,

425,0.97,2983.08,2986.65,I know it will be the bulk of the presentation this morning.,58,,
426,0.97,2986.65,2988.552,We are running ahead of time.,58,,
427,0.97,2988.552,2998.662,"Feel free to ask questions, colleagues, as we go, and make sure to use the raise hand function, and I will try to watch for that.",58,,
428,0.97,2998.662,3003.033,"Feel free to jump in at any moment, and director noble, thank you for being here.",58,,
429,0.97,3003.033,3003.567,Thank you.,59,,
430,0.97,3003.567,3014.878,I appreciate the opportunity and the partnership you have described over the course of this year and last year as well.,59,,
431,0.97,3014.878,3018.448,I look forward to working with staff moving forward through the budget process.,59,,
432,0.97,3018.448,3028.058,"My goal today is to give you a high-level overview of the budget, and the focus is really on the key highlights.",59,,
433,0.97,3028.058,3033.83,I think we have worked well with central staff in scheduling the briefings that will follow.,59,,
434,0.97,3033.83,3038.268,Virtually every one of my slides is the topic of the future briefing.,59,,
435,0.97,3038.268,3053.683,The goal is the overview as you enter the more detail the discussions to have a sense of how each individual element fits into the overall budget picture.,59,,
436,0.97,3053.683,3069.232,"Before I dive in, I will start with the comments about resources and revenues being used to support the expenditures I will provide more information on.",59,,
437,0.97,3069.232,3096.56,"In previous years this briefing included a detailed revenue briefing, but consistent with the new approach, we provided the detailed revenue briefing in August, and just about ten days ago did a quick update to the Finance Committee, essentially affirming the August forecast, and we have voted that some of the risk to the forecast, largely driven by the Delta variant have increased.",59,,
438,0.97,3096.56,3110.474,"One thing I can report before diving in, we just got another month worth of sales tax data, and it was pleasantly slightly ahead of the forecast.",59,,
439,0.97,3110.474,3113.743,We still remain confident in that forecast.,59,,
440,0.97,3113.743,3116.346,Again that underlines the budget.,59,,
441,0.97,3116.346,3130.961,"I will dive in with quick highlights around specific investment areas, and the last couple of slides talking about providing additional information about the funding sources that are supporting some of the proposed expenditures.",59,,
442,0.97,3130.961,3131.895,"Thank you, director noble.",60,,
443,0.97,3131.895,3155.085,"A quick reminder for us, when you look at the revenue forecast, and I'm glad to hear the positive news at the local level, can you remind us how much the National trends factor in to our ability to forecast local trends given sort of the unknown or potential risk that remains at the national level because of Covid?",60,,
444,0.97,3155.085,3160.891,"The national economy is a key driver, obviously.",61,,
445,0.97,3160.891,3164.127,Our local economy is not an Island.,61,,
446,0.97,3164.127,3172.569,"In our modeling, we have a regional economic model we understand historically the correlations with local economic activity and city revenue.",61,,
447,0.97,3172.569,3173.036,That's the piece.,61,,
448,0.97,3173.036,3178.508,"We run the local modeling from that, and we are able to forecast revenue.",61,,
449,0.97,3178.508,3190.987,"One of the key inputs to that local economic model, the National forecast.",61,,
450,0.97,3190.987,3195.058,"The national level, what are forecasters predicting with income and the like?",61,,
451,0.97,3195.058,3199.596,We are tracking closely with what the forecasted trends are and where they are moving.,61,,
452,0.97,3199.596,3207.737,That's one of the areas we highlighted ten days ago.,61,,
453,0.97,3207.737,3214.077,"Not dramatic, but some increasing concern around the potential impacts at the national and local level.",61,,
454,0.97,3214.077,3217.781,"With that, I will dive in.",61,,
455,0.97,3217.781,3218.448,The first slide.,61,,
456,0.97,3218.448,3230.16,"I want to talk first, just some comments early on, focusing largely on the general Fund and general governmental functions.",61,,
457,0.97,3230.16,3234.364,Happy to answer questions about the utilities and CBI.,61,,
458,0.97,3234.364,3240.07,They are not the focus of the presentation.,61,,
459,0.97,3240.07,3240.437,A high level.,61,,
460,0.97,3240.437,3257.42,"Thinking of the resources for 2022, the general fund side, we can see our revenues are recovering, and we have actually had a nominal level in simple dollar terms, almost back to our revenue base from 2019.",61,,
461,0.97,3257.42,3265.061,"That said, we are not quite there, and importantly we have had several years of inflation in between.",61,,
462,0.97,3265.061,3269.099,The effect of the purchasing power of the 2022 revenues are less than 2019.,61,,
463,0.97,3269.099,3274.771,I want to give you a sense that revenue has recovered well at this stage.,61,,
464,0.97,3274.771,3282.145,"The payroll tax is obviously compared to Precovid times, not a resource we had previously.",61,,
465,0.97,3282.145,3297.16,"This is a very significant new share for general government spending, in particular the forecast for 2022 with approximately $235 million.",61,,
466,0.97,3297.16,3305.135,"I would note, and it is mentioned here, we have yet to collect a penny of the tax.",61,,
467,0.97,3305.135,3324.254,"The first year, payments are not done until the end of the fourth quarter, effectively meaning early next year, and it's probably in February, early March Timeframe, we will know for the first time how much revenue was generated by the payroll tax.",61,,
468,0.97,3324.254,3332.762,"Going forward 2022 and beyond, it's a quarterly payment scheme just like the business and occupation tax is.",61,,
469,0.97,3332.762,3338.234,"Going forward, we will not have the same issue waiting for year end.",61,,
470,0.97,3338.234,3341.504,There is obviously uncertainty here.,61,,
471,0.97,3341.504,3348.912,"We have tried to be conservative in the forecast, but we will know more next February.",61,,
472,0.97,3348.912,3357.787,The other obvious resource at play here is the the Federal relief.,61,,
473,0.97,3357.787,3363.626,You will hear the phrase Cliffer.,61,,
474,0.97,3363.626,3366.896,It's shorthand for Coronavirus local relief.,61,,
475,0.97,3366.896,3368.398,That's Lfr for the Cliffer.,61,,
476,0.97,3368.398,3375.638,"We have $16 million for 2022, the second half of the 230 plus million dollars allocation from the Federal Government.",61,,
477,0.97,3375.638,3382.779,You will see also some of the resources that have been allocated previously have not been fully spent.,61,,
478,0.97,3382.779,3395.158,"That's per plan in most cases, and that will provide the additional resources for 2022 to direct to the key recovery.",61,,
479,0.97,3395.158,3410.039,"Fema is also a piece of the overall spending here, and part of the budget, and thinking about continuing works on Vaccinations.",61,,
480,0.97,3410.039,3428.258,"Supporting next year as we move into both boosters for Subsets of the population, and then also additional Vaccinations for initially 5 to 11 and then Ideally for children younger than five as well.",61,,
481,0.97,3428.258,3431.995,That's the array of resources at hand.,61,,
482,0.97,3431.995,3447.01,"The other point worth mentioning, given the revenue forecast update, there's additional resources from this year for 2021 we will carry into 2022 to support some of the spending in the budget as well.",61,,
483,0.97,3447.01,3450.246,That's the high level on the resource side.,61,,
484,0.97,3450.246,3458.454,"In terms of funding priorities, the bulk here effectively providing an outline for what I will be describing today.",61,,
485,0.97,3458.454,3489.886,"You will see a discussion about the restoring of base budgets, and response to homelessness, and exciting news in terms of significant new investments and affordable housing, and responding to the green new deal and Council's funding targets around the green new deal, and then I want to spend time to talk about the investments of the black indigenous and people of color, that's the shorthand there.",61,,
486,0.97,3489.886,3503.366,"Specifically $100 million allocated for last year's budget to update what is included in 2022, and also take time to note these are not the only invest.",61,,
487,0.97,3503.366,3505.668,Investments focused on the community.,61,,
488,0.97,3505.668,3533.329,"A quick slide on the overall approach on funding of the Clfr dollars and other resources we have available still that we will get a target with a full briefing for you, and then comments around the priorities and payroll tax and other funds to meet the jump start targets as we embrace the policy priorities.",61,,
489,0.97,3533.329,3533.63,Next slide.,61,,
490,0.97,3533.63,3535.298,I just saw this slide really quick.,62,,
491,0.97,3535.298,3540.603,I want to make sure we pause if there's any questions on resources or revenue.,62,,
492,0.97,3540.603,3549.045,I think it's notable the second bullet here that the Jumpstart progressive payroll tax is bringing in over 235 million anticipate.,62,,
493,0.97,3549.045,3558.121,"We still have final numbers to come, but that is good news to see that amount has shifted to 235 million.",62,,
494,0.97,3558.121,3565.828,I also think it's a good sign of continued growth at the local level.,62,,
495,0.97,3565.828,3572.635,We have seen via headlines more startups starting in Seattle than had been previously anticipated.,62,,
496,0.97,3572.635,3584.047,We are rivalling other cities with the number of startups that are beginning to put their roots down here in Seattle.,62,,
497,0.97,3584.047,3587.35,All of those are sensibly in the category of payers as well.,62,,
498,0.97,3587.35,3601.164,"What we know from the Economics in the past, a small assessment reinvested is good for the economy.",62,,
499,0.97,3601.164,3611.24,"We can welcome new businesses and assess to make sure people have a place to go and live and are well cared for, and we have investments in the priorities.",62,,
500,0.97,3611.24,3634.097,I hope the headline continues to be recognized that we saw from others about the way in which our local economy is continuing during Covid.,62,,
501,0.97,3634.097,3639.235,We want to continue to see that shared.,62,,
502,0.97,3639.235,3640.37,That's what Jumpstart Seattle was all about.,62,,
503,0.97,3640.37,3643.339,"Vice chair Herbold, please go ahead.",62,,
504,0.97,3643.339,3648.244,Thank you for letting us go for a second time you wanted questions as we went.,63,,
505,0.97,3648.244,3659.222,Really appreciate you making the time and space for that.,63,,
506,0.97,3659.222,3661.924,As relates to your point.,63,,
507,0.97,3661.924,3682.145,I want to highlight the $235 million from payroll taxes I think about 16% of the general fund contributions.,63,,
508,0.97,3682.145,3685.214,That's significant.,63,,
509,0.97,3685.214,3701.197,"The question I have about the mention about FEMA reimbursement, can you give us an estimate how much is assumed in the budget from reporting out what has been requested.",63,,
510,0.97,3701.197,3711.107,"I don't know if that's a good basis upon which to make assumptions, but I would just like more detail on the FEMA reimbursement assumptions.",63,,
511,0.97,3711.107,3718.181,"Good question, and good enough question, I think we have an entire slide on it for this part of the Federal funding presentation.",64,,
512,0.97,3718.181,3725.521,"I will do it a couple of times, more than a couple of times today.",64,,
513,0.97,3725.521,3729.225,"I think rather than the partial answer from me, it's a key issue.",64,,
514,0.97,3729.225,3735.465,"I want to explain further, the reference here was not the about the reimbursement.",64,,
515,0.97,3735.465,3741.637,"We are working through the process, but the eligibility they expect.",64,,
516,0.97,3741.637,3748.911,"It's not been formally extended into 2022, given the Presiden's commitment around boosters and Vaccinations, it seems fair to assume.",64,,
517,0.97,3748.911,3770.399,"You will see, again, we have built in some reserves to deal with some of the uncertainty around FEMA and reimbursement and further expenses for Vaccinations and other public health response.",64,,
518,0.97,3770.399,3777.24,Super helpful clarification.,65,,
519,0.97,3777.24,3779.208,Thank you.,65,,
520,0.97,3779.208,3781.777,Thank you so much.,66,,
521,0.97,3781.777,3784.68,"I see no additional hands, let's continue.",66,,
522,0.97,3784.68,3797.76,"We Envoked collectively a number of strategies to avoid the austerity budgeting and impacts of what would have otherwise been austerity budgeting that chair Mosqueda highlighted, and we were all specifically trying to avoid.",67,,
523,0.97,3797.76,3814.811,"In particular, one of the strategies we employed was to Repurpose the Voter-Approved resources, either from levies or the park district.",67,,
524,0.97,3814.811,3822.585,Approved by the voters to be above spending supported by the general fund.,67,,
525,0.97,3822.585,3840.436,"Given the shrinking resources, we shifted those into the basic operation for Childcare for centers and other purposes, and we were able to sustain city employees and avoid the potential impact of the more drastic austerity approach.",67,,
526,0.97,3840.436,3852.615,"Revenues are coming back, and we think it's important, if you will, restore faith to the voters about what was intended originally with the levies for the park district.",67,,
527,0.97,3852.615,3868.531,Funding is put back and restored to the departments able to apply for the levy resources or Park resources for the original intentions.,67,,
528,0.97,3868.531,3875.371,For libraries it was capital investments and additional hours and increased services.,67,,
529,0.97,3875.371,3878.875,Those Restorations are part of the budget.,67,,
530,0.97,3878.875,3887.717,The other strategy we deployed to sustain the city operations was draw on the fiscal Reserve.,67,,
531,0.97,3887.717,3904.3,"We started Precovid, started the crisis with the reserve of% $125 million over 2020, 2021, we have spent those down to approximately $40 million, and for the 2022 budget, we will no longer draw on the reserves.",67,,
532,0.97,3904.3,3909.839,"We can rely on, if you will, cash flow, rather than leaning on reverses.",67,,
533,0.97,3909.839,3915.811,"More than that, we will start the process of restoring reserves.",67,,
534,0.97,3915.811,3931.193,"We are proposing to do just that, contributing $25 million to reserves, increasing to a total of 65.",67,,
535,0.97,3931.193,3938.0,We sent a resolution to establish the policy for Refilling for the longer run.,67,,
536,0.97,3938.0,3945.942,"Previously the policies had a small drawdown, not the considerable one we had appropriately responding to the crisis.",67,,
537,0.97,3945.942,3948.711,We have experienced and are experiencing.,67,,
538,0.97,3948.711,3958.788,"It calls for us to restore funding up to the target levels for four additional years, a total of five.",67,,
539,0.97,3958.788,3967.096,"You will see the details of that over five years from now, hitting the target level over 125.",67,,
540,0.97,3967.096,3973.336,"The contribution goals are index for inflation and revenue growth, and they can address the needs we will potentially have in the future.",67,,
541,0.97,3973.336,3977.94,We don't feel it's too soon to start to rebuild the reserves.,67,,
542,0.97,3977.94,3979.241,That's the key component there.,67,,
543,0.97,3979.241,3998.494,"We thought these were things we needed to do before we started to think about additional spending, and I should say in general, you know, as we started to build the budget last March and last April, approaching the departments, and when we did, our basic message was that our goal was to sustain in large part, the current city activity.",67,,
544,0.97,3998.494,4011.674,We didn't expect to have the resources beyond the one-time Federal Government resources and what we knew from the payroll tax to meaningfully increase the city and increase in the expanse of the services.,67,,
545,0.97,4011.674,4026.555,"That's not to say they are not going to see, now a number of proposed additional investments, and there's other smaller ones that existed in the proposed budget as well, but overall, it's fundamentally a resource constrained proposal.",67,,
546,0.97,4026.555,4028.424,We are coming out of the recession.,67,,
547,0.97,4028.424,4031.36,We are not fully out of it.,67,,
548,0.97,4031.36,4045.207,Obviously the demand for services have changed and grown larger as a result of Covid and its impact as well.,67,,
549,0.97,4045.207,4047.51,I see there's questions.,67,,
550,0.97,4047.51,4048.01,Herbold.,68,,
551,0.97,4048.01,4052.815,"You may have said this director noble, but I missed it.",69,,
552,0.97,4052.815,4060.623,How does the 25 million for rebuilding the financial reserves compared to what is required for policy or law?,69,,
553,0.97,4060.623,4066.395,The requires contributions are less than half of that.,69,,
554,0.97,4066.395,4076.305,"Again, will provide additional information about that, but, again, those requirements I think are more in tune with a gradual or smaller withdrawal.",69,,
555,0.97,4076.305,4082.812,We thought it was important to consider the larger contributions as well.,69,,
556,0.97,4082.812,4085.648,This is what would be legally required?,70,,
557,0.97,4085.648,4085.948,Correct.,71,,
558,0.97,4085.948,4086.348,"Got it, thank you.",72,,
559,0.97,4092.655,4093.289,Any other questions?,72,,
560,0.97,4093.289,4098.828,"I can start to--Oh, there is another question.",72,,
561,0.97,4098.828,4099.395,Councilmember Pedersen?,73,,
562,0.97,4099.395,4109.738,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda, just to provide additional context for the reserves so I understand it better, if we had not dipped into the reserves at all, what would the amount be today?",74,,
563,0.97,4112.808,4123.819,"I would have to review, blue the targets would have been closer to 135 million or maybe larger than that.",75,,
564,0.97,4123.819,4129.058,"Again, the targets were indexed for inflation, on one side and revenue growth with the other.",75,,
565,0.97,4129.058,4140.002,"Growing 3% or 4% for the year, and that's what we would have--125 is what we started 2020.",75,,
566,0.97,4140.002,4151.914,"Okay, so another way of looking at it, if we had not dipped into it, we would be at, you know, actually 60 or 70 million short in a way.",76,,
567,0.97,4151.914,4176.839,"That's exactly why, again,--Okay, we can review details with central staff, but we are imagining $25 million a year for the next five years to get us back, and that would add up to 125, which is, you know, giving our existing base, pushing us to 160.",77,,
568,0.97,4176.839,4180.409,The targets will be growing behind us with the contributions.,77,,
569,0.97,4180.409,4182.645,We are anticipating the moving target.,77,,
570,0.97,4182.645,4183.479,Moves for a good reason.,77,,
571,0.97,4183.479,4191.987,"The inflation index, it is a way to be sure the purchasing power, we will be able to do what we intended to do we are serves.",77,,
572,0.97,4191.987,4194.59,"I would note, they have served us well.",77,,
573,0.97,4194.59,4212.241,"We may have wished to have more, but between those and Federal dollars and strategies, and some of which are highlighted here, we were able to sustain the city budget without significant reductions in services.",77,,
574,0.97,4212.241,4212.775,I'm not saying none.,77,,
575,0.97,4212.775,4218.514,"They were very valuable, and that's why we need to start to rebuild as soon as we can.",77,,
576,0.97,4218.514,4224.286,"Appreciate the questions Councilmember Pedersen, there's two things I want to double check on in the slide questioning.",78,,
577,0.97,4224.286,4235.364,"Number one, let's remember that the rainy day reserves are for moments just like this, of the crisis and unprecedented sometimes.",78,,
578,0.97,4235.364,4249.378,"I'm proud our city had built an emergency Reserve in emergency funds, and we were able to utilize those as the National data shows to invest in public services and most vulnerable to get out of the crisis faster.",78,,
579,0.97,4249.378,4252.581,That's what the National data says.,78,,
580,0.97,4252.581,4257.119,"When we avoid the dollars to avoid cuts, we can rebound faster.",78,,
581,0.97,4257.119,4259.788,I want to double check.,78,,
582,0.97,4259.788,4266.729,My memory is that the Council proposed restoring those funds at a higher level.,78,,
583,0.97,4266.729,4275.004,"Aly, can you remind me what the initial proposals were last year and how fast the Council suggested to rebuild it?",78,,
584,0.97,4275.004,4275.27,Sure.,79,,
585,0.97,4275.27,4279.575,I don't have the exact numbers in project of me.,79,,
586,0.97,4279.575,4296.492,"I believe last year's proposed budget relied on use of the emergency fiscal reserves, and will just as a reminder, I think director noble mentioned this, but there's two reserves, the emergency Fund and the stabilization fund.",79,,
587,0.97,4296.492,4314.009,"Drawing down both of those, drawing down both of those funds, I think the proposed budget would have reduced balances to $6 million, and the overall Council balancing package and budget added back about 28 million, so close to $30 million.",79,,
588,0.97,4320.916,4332.094,"I think that's my recollection as well from the revenue update in November, and I was heartened that Council took a large share and put it here.",80,,
589,0.97,4332.094,4339.268,"Again, we did not know it was coming, and we have seen that Nevermore.",80,,
590,0.97,4339.268,4342.771,It was prudent and an investment in the city call health for the long run.,80,,
591,0.97,4342.771,4348.41,Appreciate those comments and the line of questions as well.,81,,
592,0.97,4348.41,4351.447,I see other Councilmembers on the screen.,81,,
593,0.97,4351.447,4354.383,Any additional comments or questions?,81,,
594,0.97,4354.383,4354.583,Okay.,81,,
595,0.97,4354.583,4355.584,Thank you very much.,81,,
596,0.97,4355.584,4356.185,Let's continue.,81,,
597,0.97,4356.185,4364.293,"Okay, the next slide, and again, highlighting some of the investments of the community safety.",82,,
598,0.97,4364.293,4369.998,Obvious Ly this has been an area of significant interest.,82,,
599,0.97,4369.998,4375.938,"The budget reflects to investing in alternative models, particularly those driven that are community based.",82,,
600,0.97,4375.938,4385.547,"A high level, and I think you have heard of the various forms as well already.",82,,
601,0.97,4385.547,4390.352,"Triage one, additional funding proposed in the supplemental funding we approved.",82,,
602,0.97,4390.352,4397.76,"It would provide funding for three Two-Person teams, and housed in the fire Department.",82,,
603,0.97,4397.76,4432.728,"Dispatch to be coordinated through the community safety and communications center Department, and so the idea here, another level of response, and we have fund Memberral fire and SPD emergency response to health crises or dangerous situations, and we have new services that have come on health one, and again focused really on medical situations, not necessarily where it's the most urgent, but the medical response that is most appropriate.",82,,
604,0.97,4432.728,4460.589,"In situations there's also where some assistance in terms of providing services is also possible providing folks to additional services, and think about things like welfare checks or people in need, but not in a moment of crisis.",82,,
605,0.97,4460.589,4462.291,That would be a new investment.,82,,
606,0.97,4462.291,4463.592,I notice there's a question.,82,,
607,0.97,4463.592,4468.73,I can go on through the section or defer to the chair here.,82,,
608,0.97,4468.73,4476.405,"Why don't we finish the slide, and then Councilmember Herbold, I will call on you first.",83,,
609,0.97,4476.405,4476.705,Thank you.,83,,
610,0.97,4476.705,4477.206,Perfect.,84,,
611,0.97,4477.206,4477.506,Thank you.,84,,
612,0.97,4477.506,4482.845,"Expanding the community service officers, and proposed an officer in the name, but they are civilian.",84,,
613,0.97,4482.845,4489.585,It would be an expansion of the current force of Csos from 18 to 24.,84,,
614,0.97,4489.585,4507.536,"As you know, just to highlight for the audience as well, the assistant Nonemergency response engages the communities and neighborhood, and they have been particularly involved in the programming that SPD has around At-Risk youth.",84,,
615,0.97,4507.536,4512.541,Continuing to invest in the program and expanding it.,84,,
616,0.97,4512.541,4520.849,A number of investments related to domestic violence.,84,,
617,0.97,4520.849,4605.767,"A new pilot program that was developed in coordination with other Stakeholders, and not highlighted here, and also significant existing investments in domestic violence in terms of victim assistance, and shifting the funding source, and previously relied on these and shifting to be dependent on the general fund more explicitly, and then also additional funding for getting under the new program for the treatment, and the new program that appears to be successful or showing signs of success on the front, and in dollar terms, the largest investment here under alternatives is funding to sustain the investments that were just awarded by Rfp, from Hsd or a series of Community- based safety programs, and targeting youth and others, and so recognizing those--the funding was provided with the intent of those being ongoing, and we wanted to build into the base budget for those types programs, and then Lastly, in terms of SPD itself.",84,,
618,0.97,4605.767,4635.297,"The budget for 2021 is largely unchanged, however, there is sufficient funding to support the modest expansion of uniformed officers, and that would be a net addition of or excuse me, an addition of where we expect to end this year, and the rough math there, a target of hiring 125 officers, and then the expectation that 90 will separate, retire, or resign.",84,,
619,0.97,4635.297,4636.298,That's the average level of separation.,84,,
620,0.97,4636.298,4640.068,In recent years we have seen more than that.,84,,
621,0.97,4640.068,4647.075,"It's a guess, but again, the goal here was to provide the sufficient resource to start to rebuild the force.",84,,
622,0.97,4647.075,4663.525,"Consistent with that goal, there is a proposal for $1 million, roughly, in hiring incentives for new recruits and lateral transfers, and everything to achieve the 125.",84,,
623,0.97,4663.525,4664.726,That's an aggressive hiring goal.,84,,
624,0.97,4664.726,4672.434,"Given how competitive the market is for new officers, I expect that will be necessary to be able to achieve that goal.",84,,
625,0.97,4672.434,4682.544,"There are additional elements of the budget in this community safety base, if you will, and we have a briefing coming up that will highlight those as well.",84,,
626,0.97,4682.544,4688.75,"Not that I'm not ready to answer questions, but just know that there's more information coming.",84,,
627,0.97,4688.75,4691.486,"Okay, thank you so much.",85,,
628,0.97,4691.486,4692.654,Vice chair Herbold?,85,,
629,0.97,4692.654,4693.188,Thank you.,86,,
630,0.97,4693.188,4710.972,"I recognize that we do have a separate presentation that digs into this, but I just want to get some of my questions on the table now, even recognizing that they may not be able to be answered.",86,,
631,0.97,4710.972,4733.095,"In the July 27th presentation from the executive to the public and human services Committee, we learned that there was an agreement from both the Nick Jr. report and SPD analysis that 12% of current calls for service could be diverted to an alternative response in the near term.",86,,
632,0.97,4733.095,4746.675,"That's a quote from SPD, and it's included in 28 call types that SPD agreed may not need SPD response.",86,,
633,0.97,4746.675,4749.478,"Triage one is two call types, person down and welfare checks.",86,,
634,0.97,4749.478,4823.785,"That's a small portion of the 20% of calls, and that represents, I think 23,000 service hours, and for the triage one program, but the 12% of calls represents almost 142,000 service officers, and we are proposing in the very near term an alternative response program that can handle--or is going to address about a sixth of the service officers hours that the executive is agreeing should be directed to alternative response in the near term, so I am just--I am concerned that, you know, I was really hoping to see in this budget a proposal of how to address that 12% of calls, and those call types that SPD agrees, the whole other argument that the executive hired another consultant to critique its own report where there's not agreement about the call types that Nick Jr. recommends for alternative response, but there's no disagreement about the 28 call types.",86,,
635,0.97,4823.785,4848.877,"I'm going to flag that I'm just, um, frustrated that the triage one program is being stood up in the very near term, but there's no proposal for what we all grow should be done in the near term, and again, I'm putting air quotes around the term near term because that's the terminology used in the presentation.",86,,
636,0.97,4848.877,4849.244,Flagging that.,86,,
637,0.97,4849.244,4904.165,"Another thing, maybe you can help with, I have seen a lot of the press reporting on the Mayor's proposed budget as it relates to staffing, and it reads as if there's a proposal for an SPD budget add for officers, recognizing the increase in the overall budget, but as I understand the Council's '21, Fully-Funded staffing plan, that was based on the projection that the Department would fill 1,037 Ft1S, but the budget is based on the projection that the Department will fill no more than 1,230 Ftes in 2022.",86,,
638,0.97,4904.165,4951.379,"So to me in that area of funding for staffing, that seems like that's a reduction, and it's a reduction based on, I think the realistic projection, but it's been reported as if it's an increase in funding for officer salaries, and I'm not seeing that, but I'm also recognizing that I'm also seeing evidence that there's a lot less transparency in the proposed budget for SPD than we--or I recall seeing last year, recognizing we were last year doing Inquests on the SPD budget, but I'm struggling with the questions there.",86,,
639,0.97,4951.379,4956.418,"If I could respond, you're exactly right to the last point.",87,,
640,0.97,4956.418,4964.225,"The initial budget for 2021 assumed that the average level of officers, important to note it fluctuates over the course of the year.",87,,
641,0.97,4964.225,4969.03,"1,357 is the number I recall as well.",87,,
642,0.97,4969.03,4976.971,"The proposed budget for 2022, targeting an average level of officers of 1,230.",87,,
643,0.97,4976.971,4979.341,"That is including the 35 hires, and again, that's an average.",87,,
644,0.97,4979.341,4992.053,"The number of targeted by the end of the year would likely be higher, it's fundamentally 10 0 fewer officers funded in the budget.",87,,
645,0.97,4992.053,4994.923,No question about that.,87,,
646,0.97,4994.923,4998.727,Significant number of separations we have experienced both in 2020 and 2021.,87,,
647,0.97,4998.727,5007.035,"The budget begins to try to reverse that and begins with the sufficient funding, and again the hiring incentives to try to net 35.",87,,
648,0.97,5007.035,5014.743,"It will take us--the goal is to restore back to where the 2021 base was, and it will take several years to do that.",87,,
649,0.97,5014.743,5017.045,That's been the history with the Department.,87,,
650,0.97,5017.045,5034.963,"It can't--it's very hard to grow the force very quickly given the training requirements and the recruitment challenges, and in terms of the latter point of alternatives, I think I will defer to the presentation coming.",87,,
651,0.97,5034.963,5037.132,Triage one took time to develop.,87,,
652,0.97,5037.132,5045.94,"It's not a simple thing to develop, and framing what the alternatives will look like and the response that will be effective as an alternative.",87,,
653,0.97,5045.94,5058.753,"I think again, it may come out in the near term again, and also recognizing that the--I did not intend it as an excuse, but the description of reality.",87,,
654,0.97,5058.753,5066.561,"Covid crisis has made things like the development of new policy initiatives challenging, and as have the staffing levels.",87,,
655,0.97,5066.561,5073.701,"They are taxed to just respond moment to moment, and it's harder to take a longer strategic look given where they are.",87,,
656,0.97,5073.701,5076.037,So there will be more on that with the upcoming presentation.,87,,
657,0.97,5081.676,5087.482,"Appreciate that, and yes, thank you very much Councilmember Herbold as the chair of public safety for Teeing up those questions.",88,,
658,0.97,5087.482,5099.494,I know there will be more of the questions tomorrow afternoon as we get into the components of the Seattle police Department and public safety investments as well.,88,,
659,0.97,5099.494,5102.03,"Council President Gonzalez, I see you have your hand raised.",88,,
660,0.97,5102.03,5104.899,Thank you very much.,89,,
661,0.97,5104.899,5119.113,"Just quickly, just a quick question about assumptions in the proposed budget related to the proposed hiring plan.",89,,
662,0.97,5119.113,5178.94,"And, you know, budget director noble, I really appreciated the partnership with you over the last six years to really dig into SPD's hiring plan and how they estimate what the staffing levels they need and have, sort of appreciated the opportunity to work Collaboratively with my office and the Mayor's office estimates in this area, and I wanted to just, you know, get a better understanding of whether the assumption underlines the Mayor's proposed budget for the SPD hiring plan includes any assumptions about anticipated departures, related to uniformed officers refusing to comply with the Mayor's vaccine mandate.",89,,
663,0.97,5178.94,5189.317,We developed the overall budget before the vaccine mandate policy was developed and implemented.,90,,
664,0.97,5189.317,5190.852,"At some level, no.",90,,
665,0.97,5190.852,5233.127,"I would modify that further to say that, again, the net addition of 35 officers, reflected in the budget anticipating 125 hires and 90 separations, and I would have otherwise been here telling you there was some belief that the 90 was an Overforecast in that we have experienced historic levels of separation over the last several years, and 90 is more of an average year, and just--at some point, the open question, as many as 90 officers were left to leave, if you will.",90,,
666,0.97,5233.127,5271.199,"My thinking, there was some reason, good reason to think the forecast for separations may be low, and we may have to consider overall staffing levels on the positive sense up higher, but over the course of the next year, the Covid vaccine mandate does have the potential to leave some additional separations this year, given the timing of the mandate, and I think we will NOTE over the next couple of months whether or not that is significant impact in terms of overall staffing levels, and the mandate formerly taking effect on October 18th.",90,,
667,0.97,5271.199,5283.378,The process for seeking exemptions and coming into compliance,90,,
668,0.97,5287.482,5292.42,That is something we will learn about over the next couple months.,91,,
669,0.97,5292.42,5308.036,"In any event however, we will have more concrete data about potential separations related to Covid 19 mandate by the Mayor before the Council takes final action on the 2022 proposed budget.",92,,
670,0.97,5308.036,5316.744,Is that an accurate characterization?,92,,
671,0.97,5316.744,5327.789,I would add we develop the budget and based it on the staffing forecast we knew in August.,93,,
672,0.97,5327.789,5343.471,We will all know more about the overall forecast and year-end staffing in a couple months.,93,,
673,0.97,5343.471,5344.906,We are being asked to consider the proposed budget for 2022.,94,,
674,0.97,5344.906,5357.819,Some of the potential vaccine mandate and do separations amongst uniform staff at SPD could occur in 2021.,94,,
675,0.97,5357.819,5379.507,"Can you talk a little bit about how we thread the needle in terms of the impact of this potential separations in 2021 versus 2022? If the question is about financial impacts, I would not anticipate any significant additional savings as individual separate from the city.",94,,
676,0.97,5379.507,5381.209,They cash out of leave and the like.,94,,
677,0.97,5381.209,5387.248,There is some expense associated with that.,94,,
678,0.97,5387.248,5393.554,My guess is there is not a significant net financial impact as we were discussing.,94,,
679,0.97,5393.554,5395.223,I believe that was it a different staffing level.,94,,
680,0.97,5395.223,5406.234,"As we enter 2022, there is financial implications but also operational.",94,,
681,0.97,5406.234,5420.214,"I want to highlight this is a budget presentation but significant staffing losses in SPD or Sfd, the fire Department, could create operational impact . that is an issue being analyzed and plan for as we speak.",94,,
682,0.97,5420.214,5420.715,Thank you for that.,95,,
683,0.97,5420.715,5441.302,I really appreciate the opportunity to get that on the record and lift that particular variable up as it relates to--I know we are talking about SPD but you highlighted it could be an issue and Sfd as well and some other departments frankly.,95,,
684,0.97,5441.302,5448.976,I do want to make sure counsel central staff is working closely with you and your office.,95,,
685,0.97,5448.976,5461.322,"And relevant departments to make sure we are getting that data in the most timely fashion, so we are able to have the benefit of that information and continuing to work through the 2022 proposed budget.",95,,
686,0.97,5461.322,5488.516,"One last sort of General question, doctor noble, whether there are any other variables that are known to the city budget office or the Mayor's office that could impact the 2022 budget specifically as it relates to investments in the area of community safety and public safety?",95,,
687,0.97,5488.516,5495.223,Not that I can think of sitting here . But there is a more Detaile briefing to come.,96,,
688,0.97,5495.223,5500.328,Which is more engaged in this area.,96,,
689,0.97,5500.328,5503.364,I am not thinking explicitly about that.,96,,
690,0.97,5503.364,5512.473,Thank you.,97,,
691,0.97,5512.473,5513.341,For the opportunity to ask questions.,97,,
692,0.97,5513.341,5513.875,Thank you colleagues.,98,,
693,0.97,5513.875,5514.575,This is what this forum is for.,98,,
694,0.97,5514.575,5525.82,To get a Baselevel understanding about some critical questions before getting into the Department presentation so we have a foundation to build upon as far as questions.,98,,
695,0.97,5525.82,5528.589,I have a question and then I will turn it over.,98,,
696,0.97,5528.589,5545.606,On the last bullet you notice the sustain new Community-Based safety programs . These are the Hsd investments we just sent out the door related to last year's 2021 budget.,98,,
697,0.97,5545.606,5555.583,"All those contracts have just been finalized and $10 million went out the door, we did just add 3 million to the Hsd safety grants.",98,,
698,0.97,5555.583,5568.296,To bring the total of those grants from 18 months to a full two years.,98,,
699,0.97,5568.296,5572.6,Part of that was informed by first responders including members of the fire Department who said there needs to be a landing zone for people to go if there is going to be a triage one or triage program.,98,,
700,0.97,5572.6,5576.537,We need to make sure there are people who work in community safety housing resources.,98,,
701,0.97,5576.537,5592.32,Mental health services that are receiving these individuals versus SPD or Sfd being called at the end of the triage encounter.,98,,
702,0.97,5592.32,5595.756,And part of the rationale was to make sure we were standing up and providing Sustainability for the organizations for two years.,98,,
703,0.97,5595.756,5605.366,"Is the $3 million, is that $3 million already being assumed so there is $13 million going out to the existing contracts for the full two years?",98,,
704,0.97,5605.366,5615.776,And does that also mean that the $10 million here is actually $7 million additional for next year?,98,,
705,0.97,5615.776,5624.885,When we were building the budget and taking final action you had yet to vote on the supplemental.,99,,
706,0.97,5624.885,5629.657,We were left to anticipate or not.,99,,
707,0.97,5629.657,5630.691,We did not count on the $3 million you added.,99,,
708,0.97,5630.691,5638.799,"This $10 million, the $3 million is added to this.",99,,
709,0.97,5638.799,5643.004,"Depending on your intent, in some ways it is made redundant by the 10 man dollars.",99,,
710,0.97,5643.004,5649.276,This $10 million will be sufficient to extend the contracts in the way you had anticipated and potentially beyond.,99,,
711,0.97,5649.276,5657.551,Our goal was to build the budget so this funding would represent an ongoing portion of the city budget.,99,,
712,0.97,5657.551,5670.598,So we do not find herself entering 2023 or 2024 having to scramble to find the resource needed to sustain these programs.,99,,
713,0.97,5670.598,5675.536,"On commitment from the executive, these are intended to be ongoing, they need to be part of the base budget for 2022 and beyond that.",99,,
714,0.97,5675.536,5682.943,That $3 million that you allocated is not needed to extend this family and dollars will do that and then some.,99,,
715,0.97,5682.943,5694.455,What you choose to do with the $10 million is something you were determined as part of the process.,99,,
716,0.97,5694.455,5704.698,Thank you.,100,,
717,0.97,5707.835,5708.335,I see Allie on the line.,100,,
718,0.97,5708.335,5709.003,The me Rephrase what I heard.,100,,
719,0.97,5709.003,5712.006,"The $10 million allocated for this year, the Council because of under spend has added $3 million to the existing $10 million.",100,,
720,0.97,5712.006,5717.078,We have $13 million intended for the existing contracts to go for two years.,100,,
721,0.97,5717.078,5736.33,"If we assume there is an additional $10 million for this category of spending, we could actually see additional contracts be added for the 18 months or so, for contract said they get approved the first time around.",100,,
722,0.97,5736.33,5742.269,There was at least $40 million worth of requests for that fund source.,100,,
723,0.97,5742.269,5765.96,In theory one of the options in front of us is to continue as planned to have our existing Hsd contracts for community safety be extended for two years and be additive to that by coupling the existing $13 million with the $10 million and expand . and my understanding some of the options correctly?,100,,
724,0.97,5765.96,5783.677,"I think there will be a choice and we will put this option before you about the $3 million if it was intended to ensure the existing contracts are extended, what director noble is pointing out that this ongoing funding would ensure the existing contracts could continue.",101,,
725,0.97,5783.677,5811.338,There will be a choice for the Council whether or not to take an action to add $3 million to expand the number of organizations that are contracted or address the ongoing need as the base budget is only assuming $10 million animal need for the contracts or about $3 million could be Repurposed for other priorities.,101,,
726,0.97,5811.338,5814.041,We will continue to work through those options with all of you.,101,,
727,0.97,5814.041,5823.217,There will be some choices.,101,,
728,0.97,5823.217,5830.191,Budget takes advantage of significant one-time resources.,102,,
729,0.97,5830.191,5843.17,"Sustainability is a real challenge . and candidly, forecast basis for 2023 there are not sufficient resources to sustain what is in this proposal.",102,,
730,0.97,5843.17,5846.073,We take advantage of the opportunities we have.,102,,
731,0.97,5846.073,5848.809,But that will be a real challenge going forward.,102,,
732,0.97,5848.809,5856.116,My concern would be about expanding that challenge . It is already going to be difficult.,102,,
733,0.97,5856.116,5864.291,But I think you have framed some of the opportunities and described it well.,102,,
734,0.97,5864.291,5868.195,If I could add one more thing.,103,,
735,0.97,5868.195,5891.352,In the long-term Sustainability question that will be a question for the $10 million in the proposed as well as the $3 million . We need to sort out exactly how much of some of the investments that are included last year are included as ongoing and how much would be dependent on greater flexibility and use of the payroll tax revenue moving forward.,103,,
736,0.97,5891.352,5901.362,That is all conversations to come . When we move into issuing.,103,,
737,0.97,5901.362,5906.634,Councilmember Herbold.,104,,
738,0.97,5906.634,5936.797,"First on that topic of the additional $3 million for Community-Based safety programs, I think the language in the Council action was inclusive of the idea of being able to expand contracts that were conceived as being, I believe a year and a half long contract.",105,,
739,0.97,5936.797,5954.615,It was inclusive of expanding those contracts for more time and creating a pot . or it was inclusive of funding proposals that were received by Hsd but not chosen.,105,,
740,0.97,5954.615,5958.619,It was not limited to that either.,105,,
741,0.97,5958.619,5976.637,"If folks at Hsd are listening, I am hoping that folks who are engaged in this work are considering bringing 2021 proposals to Hsd for funding this $3 million.",105,,
742,0.97,5976.637,6001.061,We were copied on some correspondence from a coalition of about 20 different organizations that identified the fact that there needs to be immediate implementation of options and resources for creation of additional Non-Law- enforcement interventions to send to behavioral health crisis events.,105,,
743,0.97,6001.061,6014.041,"Tey say it remains broad agreement that law enforcement should be the default response to behavioral health crisis is, alternatives exist but not a full-scale.",105,,
744,0.97,6014.041,6018.746,And not in a manner to fully replace the role of law enforcement for assistance.,105,,
745,0.97,6018.746,6023.083,The void may be bigger than you realize in the immediate risks are high.,105,,
746,0.97,6023.083,6025.452,Establishing more alternatives is urgently needed.,105,,
747,0.97,6025.452,6039.666,I have really encouraged everybody who works in the space to consider the potential availability of $3 million in the 21 now.,105,,
748,0.97,6039.666,6058.018,"Considering what the options are as a Council, we should be listening to see whether such a proposal is made to Hsd and if it is made to Hsd for 2021 spending, we will not have it to allocate for 2022.",105,,
749,0.97,6058.018,6064.024,That is my personal preference.,105,,
750,0.97,6064.024,6065.059,I do see there is a great urgency right now.,105,,
751,0.97,6065.059,6066.927,And I don't want to wait until next year.,105,,
752,0.97,6066.927,6069.696,If there are proposals ready to go.,105,,
753,0.97,6069.696,6072.299,That is on that.,105,,
754,0.97,6072.299,6106.333,"Director noble, I identified my concern that when you talk about this $10 million in Communty-Based safety programs contracted by Hsd, I did not know about what is going on with the other $4 million that the Council included in this year's budget for the 2021 budget for the community safety, geographic hubs, community safety hubs.",105,,
755,0.97,6106.333,6107.668,That was another $4 million investment.,105,,
756,0.97,6107.668,6118.946,I want to know whether or not that is included . and if I could get my questions also I don't forget them.,105,,
757,0.97,6118.946,6122.149,If that is okay.,105,,
758,0.97,6122.149,6137.564,We are already being lobbied about the community service officer program and whether or not he can be moved out of SPD and into the community safety communication center.,105,,
759,0.97,6137.564,6138.565,I remember we talked about this last year.,105,,
760,0.97,6138.565,6144.805,We had heard from the Union that represents them that they were not interested in moving.,105,,
761,0.97,6144.805,6148.275,I am wondering whether or not there have been conversations about that in the intervening year.,105,,
762,0.97,6148.275,6178.739,"And finally as it relates specifically to the Dv IP program and the pilot project, in my committee last Friday had a presentation and it is more me signaling for central staff purposes on how we should--I am definitely supportive of this program.",105,,
763,0.97,6178.739,6189.349,But I think there are some principles we have heard from the task force about some principles that are embedded in the funding.,105,,
764,0.97,6189.349,6202.796,Funding is reallocated from existing funding--loss of constitutional trial rights.,105,,
765,0.97,6202.796,6210.27,It occurs in Prefiling stages and rooted in community and not expansion.,105,,
766,0.97,6210.27,6216.677,I just want to flag those principles for future discussion relates to investment.,105,,
767,0.97,6216.677,6229.99,If I might respond . I appreciate the comments about the domestic violence intervention program.,106,,
768,0.97,6229.99,6230.891,You will hear more about that shortly.,106,,
769,0.97,6230.891,6239.299,"On the CSO, the executives perspective is it is important to remain in SPD to maximize the value.",106,,
770,0.97,6239.299,6242.869,As an alternative response form.,106,,
771,0.97,6242.869,6247.774,You will hear more about that as well.,106,,
772,0.97,6247.774,6273.734,"The $4 million, my understanding [Indiscernible--low volume] on the 3 million and the question of whether we would expand the number of recipients versus spend a period of time, we are on hold on that because this issue feels like you need to determine whether you have in mind the money for extension or expansion.",106,,
773,0.97,6273.734,6277.037,And what the strategy is.,106,,
774,0.97,6277.037,6282.242,I am aware of the possibility.,106,,
775,0.97,6282.242,6282.909,It is not a line budget issue.,106,,
776,0.97,6282.909,6287.347,We will not move forward until we get more clarity.,106,,
777,0.97,6287.347,6308.368,"In a related point to that and connecting to your earlier comments about alternatives, a national level analysis, I think we know about the $10 million awarded out of Hsd.",106,,
778,0.97,6308.368,6314.341,The contracts are not for things that are immediate response.,106,,
779,0.97,6314.341,6324.985,"As the budget director, we might do well to hold back . We don't have funding in the budget to cover what those things might look like.",106,,
780,0.97,6324.985,6326.653,If they were to be developed now we don't have the funding mechanism for them.,106,,
781,0.97,6326.653,6333.927,They are very much in this space.,106,,
782,0.97,6333.927,6345.906,"I think there could be some benefit and opportunity to set aside some funding if we developed a different thing than triage one, that there would be a source to find them.",106,,
783,0.97,6345.906,6353.714,Those specific response Short- term immediate response proposals are not what the community has brought forward.,106,,
784,0.97,6353.714,6359.286,And that may well be because it is on the city to identify that formal structure.,106,,
785,0.97,6359.286,6362.723,That is a challenge.,106,,
786,0.97,6362.723,6367.027,We will need to fund them.,106,,
787,0.97,6367.027,6375.335,Councilmember Mosqueda.,107,,
788,0.97,6375.335,6383.81,"Councilmember Herbold, I am not sure that I heard a response.",107,,
789,0.97,6383.81,6395.956,The $4 million that was included last year and I think it was authorized in the 2020 budget revision but the contracts went through 2021.,107,,
790,0.97,6395.956,6406.566,I just wanted to let you know we did confirm with the Department yesterday to make sure to see in the budget the funding for community Hub work is ongoing and included in the budget.,107,,
791,0.97,6406.566,6421.882,We were balancing the resources and that is an example of things to be funded last year.,108,,
792,0.97,6421.882,6428.989,[Indiscernible],109,,
793,0.97,6428.989,6442.068,We will move on to the next slide.,110,,
794,0.97,6442.068,6444.204,Homelessness.,110,,
795,0.97,6444.204,6449.109,First I want to talk about policies and changes in talk about funding as well.,110,,
796,0.97,6449.109,6495.922,"The most obvious, you are aware but I want to highlight, the biggest news in homelessness is the King County regional homeless authority will take the lead on the response strategies as of 2022 and 90% plus of the city's funding for homelessness and related services will be transferred to the King County regional homeless authority . and then we will work with them . It is governing bodies and we will work with them.",110,,
797,0.97,6495.922,6507.067,We are currently developing a master services agreement . a contract that will govern this allocation of city funds to the regional agency.,110,,
798,0.97,6507.067,6511.571,I also want to note we work with the agency in developing the proposed budget.,110,,
799,0.97,6511.571,6521.648,"Some of the specific funding strategies and approaches was informed by our work with them, that is not to say they might not want additional resource.",110,,
800,0.97,6521.648,6531.858,We are balancing needs across not just homelessness but across a variety of city services and we need to keep that in consideration.,110,,
801,0.97,6531.858,6536.997,That is a very big move.,110,,
802,0.97,6536.997,6537.631,I wanted to highlight that.,110,,
803,0.97,6537.631,6544.471,"In terms of shelter and related services, the budget largely sustains--I will highlight expansions.",110,,
804,0.97,6544.471,6554.681,Sustains the shelter facilities we are currently operating and operating in a modified way in response to Covid.,110,,
805,0.97,6554.681,6565.625,"Just calling out some individual specifics . There is funding in term of expansion, operational funding for that going forward.",110,,
806,0.97,6565.625,6570.163,Funding for the Salvation Army facility.,110,,
807,0.97,6570.163,6578.838,That is a larger facility that has been stood up.,110,,
808,0.97,6578.838,6590.317,We further expansion for funding to support three tiny home villages.,110,,
809,0.97,6590.317,6602.662,And there is funding to sustain or support existing providers and additional cost for operating in the world of Covid.,110,,
810,0.97,6602.662,6614.741,"Much of this funding, Federal funding detail is funded from Federal resource and not necessarily exclusively.",110,,
811,0.97,6614.741,6624.784,I wanted to highlight--you will hear more about this--implementing a new strategy.,110,,
812,0.97,6624.784,6655.649,"You take City resources that could be payroll tax in the context of service in the support of affordable housing, City resources that would fund services that would be paired with federally funded housing grants to help folks who are in the current shelter system that are not ready to take on housing but maybe if there is additional support provided.",110,,
813,0.97,6655.649,6666.192,I think that is an effective way to leverage the Federal resource plan to increase throughput to the shelter system.,110,,
814,0.97,6666.192,6674.334,The best opportunity to provide shelter to folks who are living on the street or elsewhere.,110,,
815,0.97,6674.334,6680.04,Those are ultimately available when we can place people into Úlong-Term housing.,110,,
816,0.97,6680.04,6684.11,And that is the goal of the system.,110,,
817,0.97,6684.11,6685.278,This is a step toward expanding those opportunities.,110,,
818,0.97,6685.278,6690.75,You will hear more about the significant investments in affordable housing that are along those lines.,110,,
819,0.97,6690.75,6706.366,"In addition I tried to highlight, ongoing funding for transitional housing that has multiple bedrooms . In order to support larger families.",110,,
820,0.97,6706.366,6719.779,That is not exclusively a characteristic but something we do see and we want to make sure you have appropriate facilities . that was added last year and sustained this.,110,,
821,0.97,6719.779,6729.089,Much more detailed briefing coming on overall shelter and I am happy to answer questions.,110,,
822,0.97,6729.089,6731.257,There are others who know a good deal more about this than I. and also the clean city program.,110,,
823,0.97,6731.257,6748.975,This is addressing issues with Unsanctioned Encampments and folks being forced to live on the street or in parks or elsewhere.,110,,
824,0.97,6748.975,6757.417,The tranche one allocation of Clfr dollars includes approximately $6 million for clean city.,110,,
825,0.97,6757.417,6766.626,"Which involves targeted garbage collection to known Encampments, needle collection, a variety of services to address needs.",110,,
826,0.97,6766.626,6783.61,And the proposal would sustain that funding level . The idea was this has been conceived as a response to the current crisis.,110,,
827,0.97,6783.61,6796.956,And the increase in the number of folks who are living outside the park because of the need to Úbe sensitive to public health issues associated with Covid.,110,,
828,0.97,6796.956,6814.174,"Whether or not the Timeline we have imagined is realistic, in July as we were building the budget we thought we were seeing that we crested the worst of Covid . whether that is the case or not any longer is really unclear.",110,,
829,0.97,6814.174,6816.376,I wanted to give you a sense of what we were thinking as we developed a proposal.,110,,
830,0.97,6816.376,6830.19,Additionally there is resource general fund resource to expand outreach and services to folks who are living in recreational vehicles that includes hygiene services.,110,,
831,0.97,6830.19,6842.168,"Pop outs, sanitation facilities and rubbish collection.",110,,
832,0.97,6842.168,6847.04,And additional resource provided to parks on a couple of friends.,110,,
833,0.97,6847.04,6852.879,One is one-time funding that we will use real estate excise tax.,110,,
834,0.97,6852.879,6854.814,The eligible use for capital improvements in the parks.,110,,
835,0.97,6854.814,6860.92,The idea is not see much improvement but restoration.,110,,
836,0.97,6860.92,6872.699,"Damage to park properties, plantings to facilities and the like, they have seen that.",110,,
837,0.97,6872.699,6877.403,And allocation of $2 million.,110,,
838,0.97,6877.403,6897.323,Also ongoing operational funding and staffing are parks to take a more direct role in addressing impacts of Encampments . that would include outreach and work to find alternative living arrangements for folks who are in the park and right away's as well.,110,,
839,0.97,6897.323,6900.793,Consistent with the protocols.,110,,
840,0.97,6900.793,6919.746,"Given the park Department the resources it needs to actively and Proactively address the large number of folks who are living in the park now, unsheltered.",110,,
841,0.97,6919.746,6927.787,"And as we move forward through Covid, trying to find them permanent locations and to restore parks for more general use.",110,,
842,0.97,6927.787,6933.192,"The briefing coming up tomorrow on the overall strategy, we can describe this further.",110,,
843,0.97,6933.192,6936.896,I would be happy to take any initial questions.,110,,
844,0.97,6936.896,6940.867,Thank you.,111,,
845,0.97,6940.867,6951.811,I know there will be a handful of questions for the Department tomorrow and I appreciate out that Councilmember Lewis has a handful of questions.,111,,
846,0.97,6951.811,6961.22,When we go through each Department we will turn to the Council members to have the Department within the committee's Purview to have the first line of questions.,111,,
847,0.97,6961.22,6963.623,Councilmember Gonzalez.,111,,
848,0.97,6963.623,6981.841,"Just really quickly, Councilmember Lewis and I both sit on the governing Committee for the King County regional homelessness authority and we represent, we are two of three representatives.",112,,
849,0.97,6981.841,7006.666,"As we are looking at the budget that is being proposed by the Mayor, I just wanted to get, make really clear for the record that what kinds of shelter and services they are undertaking.",112,,
850,0.97,7006.666,7017.21,We will do a deep dive tomorrow.,112,,
851,0.97,7017.71,7049.809,"But director noble, I want to make sure we have a clear understanding of what functions, for lack of a better term, will remain within the city's jurisdiction? in other words, what are we essentially funding through this proposed 2022 budget, based on the presumption that this is sort of what will be left to the city's responsibility to address in terms of homelessness services?",112,,
852,0.97,7049.809,7056.916,I will defer in part to what is coming.,113,,
853,0.97,7056.916,7059.585,The next slide.,113,,
854,0.97,7059.585,7074.534,Affordable housing investments--housing will take the lead on long-term permanent housing.,113,,
855,0.97,7074.534,7075.535,That is probably the most critical Componen.,113,,
856,0.97,7075.535,7087.547,"In terms of shelter services and the like, the vast majority of that is transferred to the King County authority.",113,,
857,0.97,7087.547,7100.76,Some of the clean city type activities are dealing with issues in the Right-Of-Way and in parks in terms of impact and as and when appropriate clean up and that would remain to the city.,113,,
858,0.97,7100.76,7105.498,Most outreach as I understand would be the original authority.,113,,
859,0.97,7105.498,7107.633,I am not the expert on this.,113,,
860,0.97,7107.633,7115.041,There are many more who are and appropriately we could schedule to dig deep into this.,113,,
861,0.97,7115.041,7115.575,I appreciate that.,114,,
862,0.97,7115.575,7130.189,I did not need to make you ask questions on behalf of the King County regional homeless authority.,114,,
863,0.97,7130.189,7142.602,What I wanted to get at is the Mayor's proposed budget includes funding for addressing impacts related to Unsanctioned Encampments . and folks who are surviving outside.,114,,
864,0.97,7142.602,7149.175,Based on the agreement that that function will remain with the city of Seattle.,114,,
865,0.97,7149.175,7150.009,Correct.,115,,
866,0.97,7150.009,7152.311,Thank you.,116,,
867,0.97,7152.311,7157.35,I think that is important for tomorrow's discussion.,117,,
868,0.97,7157.35,7158.618,I appreciate that being flagged today.,117,,
869,0.97,7158.618,7168.594,Anything else Council President? okay.,117,,
870,0.97,7168.594,7169.462,"Councilmember Lewis, please go ahead.",117,,
871,0.97,7169.462,7170.029,Thank you Madam chair.,118,,
872,0.97,7170.029,7175.134,I don't have many questions.,118,,
873,0.97,7175.134,7180.706,As the exchange with Council president and director noble demonstrated.,118,,
874,0.97,7180.706,7182.175,Most of the questions are about implementation and executive policy.,118,,
875,0.97,7182.175,7183.643,They are best for later in the week.,118,,
876,0.97,7183.643,7205.431,I want to flag my appreciation for following up on the councils full funding of these three additional tiny home villages for 2021 and make sure that is a sustained 2022 investment as well.,118,,
877,0.97,7205.431,7208.568,I know that has been and implementation sticking point and I am glad to see we have alignment on that and it is baked into the initial proposal.,118,,
878,0.97,7208.568,7225.051,"The only other comment I would make, it is Foreshadowing a policy discussion that will be interwoven throughout the broader budget process will be the conversation about the intersections of outreach and enforcement.",118,,
879,0.97,7225.051,7228.254,I think it is more of a policy than a budget question.,118,,
880,0.97,7228.254,7248.941,I think this counsel consistently and I think it is the correct position has wanted to seek a strategy that Bifurcated's outreach enforcement instead of merging them together and to one thing.,118,,
881,0.97,7250.843,7254.58,Which has been problematic and in some cases made it difficult to do business with providers who do not want to be involved in the system that merges outreach with enforcement.,118,,
882,0.97,7254.58,7268.828,I think we have an opportunity to really clearly place outrage under the authority that will be outreach without coercion and person centered.,118,,
883,0.97,7268.828,7287.847,"And have things that are enforcement focused, stay within the city family and have a clear delineation . So we are not Co-Mingling and we are not continuing to have those trust issues with our neighbors, surviving outside and with the provider community.",118,,
884,0.97,7287.847,7292.952,I think it will be an interesting policy discussion.,118,,
885,0.97,7292.952,7297.556,Starting in earnest on Thursday but probably going throughout the's budget discussion.,118,,
886,0.97,7297.556,7311.971,And the way to do some system realignment to work on some of the barriers that we have been experiencing through our state of emergency on homelessness that has resulted in a lot of hurdles and not realizing as much success as we would like to see.,118,,
887,0.97,7311.971,7318.878,I will leave it there but I appreciate these initial investments that are baked into the budget at the front.,118,,
888,0.97,7318.878,7330.656,And look forward to talking on Thursday about how we will move forward on that in the end of this year and going into 2022.,118,,
889,0.97,7330.656,7331.757,Thank you.,118,,
890,0.97,7331.757,7339.765,That was a very effective framing from the budget directors perspective.,119,,
891,0.97,7339.765,7349.208,It is much more of a policy discussion around the proposals for parks increased involvement.,119,,
892,0.97,7349.208,7355.381,I will not tell you that $1 million is not a lot of money in the overall context it is not the biggest allocation.,119,,
893,0.97,7355.381,7365.424,But there is a policy issue here and the proposals are in response in part to the fact that the current strategies those seem to be entirely successful.,119,,
894,0.97,7365.424,7373.899,But there is every room for a policy discussion about what approaches we should be investing in and what those will look like.,119,,
895,0.97,7373.899,7374.2,Thank you.,119,,
896,0.97,7374.2,7378.938,You have friend that well.,119,,
897,0.97,7378.938,7383.409,I will bring you folks on Thursday that will be informed.,119,,
898,0.97,7383.409,7386.645,I will take that complement and quit while I'm ahead.,120,,
899,0.97,7386.645,7390.649,Thank you.,120,,
900,0.97,7390.649,7404.864,Thank you to Council president and Councilmember Lewis as the representatives on the regional homelessness authority.,121,,
901,0.97,7404.864,7420.679,And folks who have been bridging both the creation of the Rha and importantly making sure that we are also responding as a city to the pressing needs as the new Departmentget stood up.,121,,
902,0.97,7420.679,7425.985,We are all interested in making sure the city's response does not grind to a halt as we stand at the other strategies on the horizon.,121,,
903,0.97,7425.985,7429.221,I am happy to see this as Councilmember Lewis has noted.,121,,
904,0.97,7429.221,7439.064,I do think that the calling out of the $2.4 million is an important item.,121,,
905,0.97,7439.064,7445.604,It happens to be the same amount that we had included for this year's budget allocation.,121,,
906,0.97,7445.604,7447.873,I don't want that to be confused.,121,,
907,0.97,7447.873,7461.854,"If I understand correctly, we have allocated in this year's supplemental budget, $2 million from the state capital budget that the state Legislature has authorized for us.",121,,
908,0.97,7461.854,7472.231,We coupled that with about $.4 million from the funds to begin to stand up these three additional tiny House villages.,121,,
909,0.97,7472.231,7478.737,What I think is bullet represents is an additional $2.4 million specifically for the operation funding.,121,,
910,0.97,7478.737,7488.013,"So we can continue into next year as we stand up the bigger, better, boulder strategies under the Rha.",121,,
911,0.97,7488.013,7488.414,Is that correct?,121,,
912,0.97,7488.414,7491.05,That is exactly correct.,122,,
913,0.97,7491.05,7494.52,It is partial year funding for this year.,122,,
914,0.97,7494.52,7497.256,But it is sustained for all of 2022.,122,,
915,0.97,7497.256,7500.626,And building a base budget for beyond.,122,,
916,0.97,7500.626,7510.536,With the longer-term strategies become part.,122,,
917,0.97,7510.536,7510.87,Wonderful.,123,,
918,0.97,7510.87,7516.075,As we get into the budget details I think that is important.,123,,
919,0.97,7516.075,7527.286,And I want to thank our legislative partners who had worked hard on a $2 million in capital funds.,123,,
920,0.97,7527.286,7543.936,I appreciate there is an effort as announced by Councilmember Lewis that there is movement forward on getting those sites stood up and also our partners at the Department of Commerce who have clarified if they are created on city-owned land that satisfies the control requirement.,123,,
921,0.97,7543.936,7544.87,Glad to hear there is potential movement.,123,,
922,0.97,7544.87,7561.787,The biggest question on all of these pieces including the upcoming slides will be the color of money and where the money is coming from to find these things versus where it was initially envisioned . As we get into the details tomorrow I will ask questions about where these fund sources come from.,123,,
923,0.97,7561.787,7563.355,I am glad to hear there is implementation movement on those pieces.,123,,
924,0.97,7563.355,7564.29,Let's keep moving.,123,,
925,0.97,7564.29,7568.727,Next slide.,124,,
926,0.97,7568.727,7571.797,Affordable housing.,124,,
927,0.97,7571.797,7577.303,"For my and this is the most significant policy move happening in the space, if you will.",124,,
928,0.97,7577.303,7582.141,As highlighted in the first bullet.,124,,
929,0.97,7582.141,7588.38,The proposed budget includes historic level of funding for office of housing and affordable housing.,124,,
930,0.97,7588.38,7593.519,The budget is almost $20 million and an increase of more than $100 million over 2021.,124,,
931,0.97,7593.519,7606.165,"That additional funding, I will talk about sources, the use is the largest to use in housing capital.",124,,
932,0.97,7606.165,7614.84,"Standing up and building new facilities or as recently acquiring facilities, housing apartments that have been built.",124,,
933,0.97,7614.84,7625.884,In terms of totals that includes more than $50 million of Federal assistance and affordable housing is an eligible use.,124,,
934,0.97,7625.884,7653.579,The idea of using that resource to make a long-term investment seems particularly wise . a significant share of tax rule money . also directed--show into affordable housing as well.,124,,
935,0.97,7653.579,7654.88,With the pandemic the revenues have been less than expected.,124,,
936,0.97,7654.88,7657.316,There is an allocation of those resources.,124,,
937,0.97,7657.316,7672.498,The Mha program with increasing development has proven to be a robust revenue source for affordable housing and investing in long-term capital as well.,124,,
938,0.97,7672.498,7701.66,The next category is also about housing capital but I wanted to highlight it is specifically targeting issues of displacement and Ideally communities facing pressures of Gentrification . I will talk about this more going forward with the proposal.,124,,
939,0.97,7701.66,7719.378,Being responsive to counsel's appropriate emphasis on affordable housing as a priority . to take what the strategic investment Fund and restructure it slightly and we are a little bit more goes to this particular housing element.,124,,
940,0.97,7719.378,7726.785,That helps us achieve an overall increased level of investment in the capital needed for affordable housing.,124,,
941,0.97,7726.785,7735.494,But also responsive to concerns about displacement and the impacts that Gentrification are having on the city's community of color in particular.,124,,
942,0.97,7735.494,7745.771,Also in this space is funding for one of the recommendations from the equitable task force.,124,,
943,0.97,7745.771,7768.427,That task force of recommended $6 million to be invested in homeownership . particularly targeting communities where homeownership is lagging because of overt and Long-Standing historic racist policies around housing.,124,,
944,0.97,7768.427,7778.003,I will talk later about the overall funding sources but highlighting the proposal to fund this with payroll tax revenues.,124,,
945,0.97,7778.003,7800.058,One of the specific priorities identified in the Jumpstart resolution was homeownership this is a place where interests are aligned.,124,,
946,0.97,7800.058,7804.463,Most dramatic policy shift or policy investment represented in the budget is around affordable housing.,124,,
947,0.97,7804.463,7815.741,This is a good summary and I will do everything shortly from director Alvarado to provide additional detail.,124,,
948,0.97,7815.741,7821.146,I am happy to take questions.,124,,
949,0.97,7821.146,7821.647,That you so much.,125,,
950,0.97,7821.647,7828.053,I will hold my questions on the funding source for your last slide.,125,,
951,0.97,7828.053,7828.52,As you circle back.,125,,
952,0.97,7828.52,7844.236,And I asked him a question about the previous slide related to the clean cities initiative.,125,,
953,0.97,7846.772,7849.575,For me I think the investments in health and hygiene is really paramount in addition to housing in the upcoming year's budget.,125,,
954,0.97,7849.575,7852.177,I want to ask a few questions.,125,,
955,0.97,7852.177,7866.925,We do see from the clean cities initiative through parks and utilities and Ask.There is an investment for more investments going into the clean cities initiative.,125,,
956,0.97,7866.925,7868.06,But that looks like it is going until August 2022.,125,,
957,0.97,7868.06,7893.352,"Can you answer from the budget, CBO perspective, while using the one-time resources like the Federal funds to support this work that is Time-Limited when we can be certain we know we will do this going forward?",125,,
958,0.97,7893.352,7898.09,"Even though it is one-time work, why are we assuming it will end in August of next year versus at least carry it through the full budget?",125,,
959,0.97,7898.09,7902.361,They good question.,126,,
960,0.97,7902.361,7926.718,"The initial investment of the Federal resource, the expectation was in fact this would be a response to the growing challenges of folks living unsheltered in the right of ways and parks and elsewhere.",126,,
961,0.97,7926.718,7930.689,There is not the expectation that it would be an ongoing level of sustained activity.,126,,
962,0.97,7930.689,7933.492,I think that is among the questions that will be before you.,126,,
963,0.97,7933.492,7940.899,"This is a question, there are twofold reasons why there was not additional funding provided.",126,,
964,0.97,7940.899,7961.119,"The constraints of how much total resource there is . and the other is was originally trained as a short-term covered response, short-term being more than a year.",126,,
965,0.97,7961.119,7966.925,"As we debated this internally, I was aware of the potential for this to become an issue.",126,,
966,0.97,7966.925,7981.707,Midyear next year about whether or not we had Sufficien resource allocated whether or not we would want to try to redirect additional resource.,126,,
967,0.97,7984.309,7988.413,Thank you.,127,,
968,0.97,7988.413,7990.349,We will come back to this tomorrow.,127,,
969,0.97,7990.349,7998.457,Given the need to make sure that those services are funded for the full year and not just a half.,127,,
970,0.97,7998.457,7999.658,Councilmember Lewis.,127,,
971,0.97,7999.658,8004.963,Thank you.,128,,
972,0.97,8004.963,8005.33,Madam chair.,128,,
973,0.97,8005.33,8016.508,I think this is less of a question for the director and more of an issue area flagging as we go through the clean city investments.,128,,
974,0.97,8016.508,8022.848,I am particularly interested in how we can expand hygiene infrastructure in the city.,128,,
975,0.97,8022.848,8029.388,"This has been a long, going back to the beginning of the pandemic.",128,,
976,0.97,8029.388,8057.883,"Particularly I want to mention Councilmember Morales leadership . One thing I want to fly, I am aware of certain hygiene products out there for acquisition that would probably be cheaper than the ones we are currently renting and leasing.",128,,
977,0.97,8057.883,8072.697,"There is probably an ability to use those assets going into the future that we acquired, even beyond the emergency, be it in a sheltering capacity or something else.",128,,
978,0.97,8072.697,8078.036,The pallet in particular makes a particular good hygiene unit.,128,,
979,0.97,8078.036,8079.404,"It is showers, SINKS, readily deployable.",128,,
980,0.97,8079.404,8085.043,"Berries 30 that runs 30- $60,000 to buy it.",128,,
981,0.97,8085.043,8094.753,"Rather, it is and several thousands a month to lease some hygiene things.",128,,
982,0.97,8094.753,8095.22,I want to fly back.,128,,
983,0.97,8095.22,8108.567,If we might look toward a policy of acquisition and siding resources like this in a big and Broadway.,128,,
984,0.97,8108.567,8116.541,I think the most effective policy response to the complaints are received frequently from businesses of people who are living unsheltered and are relieving themselves in public would be to provide Restrooms.,128,,
985,0.97,8116.541,8121.012,In a more skilled up and readily available way then we have been.,128,,
986,0.97,8121.012,8136.194,I think part of his has been cost limited and how we are Procuring them and their other hygiene products on the market that we could acquire that would allow more Scalability.,128,,
987,0.97,8136.194,8147.105,I want to flag of that . It almost sounds like I am Scoping for a potential audit.,128,,
988,0.97,8147.105,8154.679,I do think going into the next budget cycle that would be something I would be interested in.,128,,
989,0.97,8154.679,8159.217,If there is ways we can get more value out of that through acquisition the maybe being more nimble.,128,,
990,0.97,8159.217,8180.305,"[Indiscernible] I know some of the initial procurement, led us to leasing equipment.",129,,
991,0.97,8180.305,8185.744,There has been a shift toward purchasing.,129,,
992,0.97,8185.744,8197.255,Another example where someone knows more than I. other thing I would comment is it is a real issue as cost.,129,,
993,0.97,8197.255,8227.619,The city knows that steps have been taken . Recognizing it has been an issue and it has been considered in the past.,129,,
994,0.97,8230.655,8230.989,Thank you.,130,,
995,0.97,8230.989,8232.057,I think a good flag for our future conversations.,130,,
996,0.97,8232.057,8237.896,Not just tomorrow but throughout the budget . health and hygiene are some of my top priorities along with housing for the budget.,130,,
997,0.97,8237.896,8244.002,"I think that is how our counsel proposed budget centers on health, safety and housing.",130,,
998,0.97,8244.002,8248.006,And look forward to the future conversations.,130,,
999,0.97,8248.006,8257.315,Good recognition of the work of Councilmember Morales past work.,130,,
1000,0.97,8257.315,8258.483,Alley do you have anything,130,,
1001,0.97,8258.483,8262.821,I was just nodding.,131,,
1002,0.97,8262.821,8264.289,Staff was taking notes on the direction.,131,,
1003,0.97,8264.289,8268.727,As always.,132,,
1004,0.97,8268.727,8275.8,I think we are on to the slide after housing.,132,,
1005,0.97,8275.8,8286.211,The green new deal.,133,,
1006,0.97,8286.811,8296.321,I was highlighting affordable housing as terms of the most significant policy move in the budget but both of these are significant as well and important.,133,,
1007,0.97,8296.321,8298.423,Really gratifying to include these.,133,,
1008,0.97,8298.423,8309.434,The budget includes 14+--$14.3 million in new funding for the green new deal.,133,,
1009,0.97,8309.434,8317.642,That is consistent with the funding level called out in the Jumpstart resolution an ordinance.,133,,
1010,0.97,8317.642,8325.617,"In terms of specifics, $6.5 million, not quite half is Unallocated in the budget.",133,,
1011,0.97,8325.617,8328.353,With the expectation that the green new deal advisory board would make recommendations about how to allocate those resources.,133,,
1012,0.97,8328.353,8338.93,"Recognizing it would take time to do that, we thought it was appropriate to have important policy objectives for some share of the remaining funds.",133,,
1013,0.97,8338.93,8353.311,But the idea is the Advisory board would recommend $6.5 million that remains Unallocated for 2022 and recommendations for 2023 and beyond as well.,133,,
1014,0.97,8353.311,8370.595,"If they are just getting stood up, we are looking to get recommendations on 2023 funding by midyear next year.",133,,
1015,0.97,8370.595,8387.712,So we can incorporate those into our budget process . They will have the opportunity to allocate money for 2021.,133,,
1016,0.97,8387.712,8395.754,That is the first chunk of the money.,133,,
1017,0.97,8395.754,8399.958,$1 million directed into the Duwamish Valley program.,133,,
1018,0.97,8399.958,8407.098,And overall funding initiative.,133,,
1019,0.97,8407.098,8415.173,Subsidizing conversions from oil fueled furnaces to heat pumps.,133,,
1020,0.97,8415.173,8435.293,This is a one time $1.7 million appropriation . The basic idea is the original policy intense of the Mayor and Council had been O find and subsidize th conversions with modest tax to be imposed on home heating oil.,133,,
1021,0.97,8435.293,8442.634,"However, given the economic and financial impacts of Covid a policy decision has been made to delay the implementation of the tax.",133,,
1022,0.97,8442.634,8447.305,We didn't want to delay the implementation of the conversion program.,133,,
1023,0.97,8447.305,8461.886,"Even if the revenues are going to be forthcoming, this could be used on a one-time basis to plug in and continue on a schedule we anticipated as if the tax had been imposed on the original schedule.",133,,
1024,0.97,8461.886,8467.025,That is the idea.,133,,
1025,0.97,8467.025,8475.934,Osd is coming forward to give their departmental update and overview and I can tell you more about the clean energy program.,133,,
1026,0.97,8475.934,8483.475,This is consistent with the policy goals called out in the Jumpstart legislation.,133,,
1027,0.97,8483.475,8491.816,And with the notion that the green new deal holds real promise for employment opportunities in new fields and new areas.,133,,
1028,0.97,8491.816,8502.36,Investing for the longer run by developing job skills needed to take advantage of the opportunities.,133,,
1029,0.97,8502.36,8503.595,There is an expansion of the environmental justice Fund.,133,,
1030,0.97,8503.595,8509.767,This was a recommendation of the equitable city task force as well.,133,,
1031,0.97,8509.767,8516.441,Entirely consistent with environmental justice and the principles of the green new deal.,133,,
1032,0.97,8516.441,8529.821,Some additional investments around clean building accelerator program so we can ring our buildings up to standard.,133,,
1033,0.97,8529.821,8540.665,"There is also some investments in city light, not with a source of funding but to mention on Electrification overall, vehicles in particular but not recently, D.O.T.",133,,
1034,0.97,8540.665,8552.81,Has in analytic tool so they can get a better idea of the potential impacts associated from vehicles and transportation for climate change.,133,,
1035,0.97,8552.81,8556.714,And overall package.,133,,
1036,0.97,8556.714,8562.487,The vast majority of this funding is from the payroll tax . consistent with the green new deal.,133,,
1037,0.97,8562.487,8575.3,We are taking advantage of the flexibility in the Federal money to support a portion of this that is job development.,133,,
1038,0.97,8575.3,8575.8,That is a high level.,133,,
1039,0.97,8575.8,8577.535,There are question so I may wait and answer the questions.,133,,
1040,0.97,8577.535,8581.94,And then move on.,133,,
1041,0.97,8581.94,8585.843,Councilmember Morales.,134,,
1042,0.97,8585.843,8598.022,"Can you remind me for the home heating oil tax, what the anticipated revenue from that would be?",135,,
1043,0.97,8598.022,8598.856,I don't have that in front of me.,135,,
1044,0.97,8598.856,8607.799,I will get back to you . a number calling for million dollars or $5 million.,135,,
1045,0.97,8607.799,8615.34,I am interesting in figuring out what the revenue would be and for how long.,136,,
1046,0.97,8615.34,8623.247,"My recollection is there are about 16,000 homes in the city will potentially participate in this conversion program.",136,,
1047,0.97,8623.247,8669.894,"Interested over time how much revenue would we collect and when those 16,000 folks have converted, we would continue to fund for low-income families or subsidize or pay for their conversion? I am also interested to know if the low income households, we identified about 1000 who are low income who have home heating oil and would need to convert, if they also pay the tax or are they exempt from the tax?",136,,
1048,0.97,8669.894,8671.062,"If you have that information, that would be helpful.",136,,
1049,0.97,8671.062,8671.663,"If not, I have questions for",136,,
1050,0.97,8671.663,8682.407,"I don't have information on hand but this afternoon, I will get some research.",137,,
1051,0.97,8682.407,8686.244,Better to wait and bring you the folks who are the program specialists in the area.,137,,
1052,0.97,8686.244,8696.354,Timeline over the conversion is one of the specific reason the Mayor proposed this one-time funding.,137,,
1053,0.97,8696.354,8713.037,We had a path and a schedule about the conversion and although we are delaying implementation of the tax we did not want to delay the actual conversions of the furnaces so we can achieve the climate impact can be successful.,137,,
1054,0.97,8713.037,8716.874,In the overall strategy.,137,,
1055,0.97,8716.874,8727.151,I had part of the information.,138,,
1056,0.97,8727.151,8731.389,But relying on the previous memo.,138,,
1057,0.97,8731.389,8740.631,I believe you sponsored to delay implementation of the tax.,138,,
1058,0.97,8740.631,8750.775,"The estimate was about $7.8 million that would be generated from the tax between 2021 until 2029 with the delay about $890,000 reduction.",138,,
1059,0.97,8750.775,8757.215,The estimate is closer to $7 million for that tax period.,138,,
1060,0.97,8757.215,8770.561,$1.7 million makes up for more than what the delay cost.,138,,
1061,0.97,8771.195,8771.662,Thank you so much.,139,,
1062,0.97,8771.662,8774.932,I am not seeing additional questions.,139,,
1063,0.97,8774.932,8778.136,Let's talk about the Duwamish Valley program.,140,,
1064,0.97,8778.136,8785.376,Osd presented to you and failed to provide additional information.,140,,
1065,0.97,8785.376,8787.245,This is an exciting initiative and funding proposal.,140,,
1066,0.97,8787.245,8814.972,"I think you all know the city has been engaged with different agencies and communities on community development, economic the moment, environmental restoration, identifying with the community those priorities.",140,,
1067,0.97,8814.972,8823.481,What we are doing is putting our money where our mouth is and moving toward limitation.,140,,
1068,0.97,8823.481,8839.597,I share this funding comes from the green new deal portion of the resources allocated under the payroll tax . that is because this is the green new deal in action in my view in no small part.,140,,
1069,0.97,8839.597,8847.104,Not all of this funding comes from [Indiscernible] kinds of investments just to highlight a few of them.,140,,
1070,0.97,8847.104,8853.611,More detail to calm.,140,,
1071,0.97,8853.611,8864.422,"Expanding the Duwamish Valley youth Corps which provides opportunities . training, education and a light.",140,,
1072,0.97,8864.422,8881.639,"For a specific proposal designed to target air pollution in the area, incentives for heavy-duty vehicles so they can be converted to electric power . to avoid the Particulates and air pollution associated with diesel and heavy-duty vehicles.",140,,
1073,0.97,8881.639,8885.109,Workforce development investment.,140,,
1074,0.97,8885.109,8892.65,Capital project to improve pedestrian access along eighth Avenue.,140,,
1075,0.97,8892.65,8899.557,An opportunity to get to the river itself.,140,,
1076,0.97,8899.557,8911.068,Some resource targeted for the Duwamish Valley businesses in particular.,140,,
1077,0.97,8911.068,8920.578,They have been particularly impacted by Covid but also indirectly or directly for work on the West Seattle bridge in the redirection of traffic on various routes.,140,,
1078,0.97,8920.578,8944.068,"Another interesting idea, opportunities to use things to define and shield residential areas from industrial properties so relative proximity is a reality and to make it work better for the residents and businesses.",140,,
1079,0.97,8944.068,8952.677,Commitment to ongoing staff so this work can be supported going forward and we will have sufficient resource to do that.,140,,
1080,0.97,8952.677,8960.484,And some investments coming out of the parks Department for the South Park community center and the park and the community center overall.,140,,
1081,0.97,8960.484,8972.396,Some resource is ongoing and some is one time but the overall effect is it is Esigned to advance our investments in the Duwamish Valley Valley overall.,140,,
1082,0.97,8972.396,8979.036,Thank you so much.,141,,
1083,0.97,8979.036,8979.57,Councilmember Herbold.,141,,
1084,0.97,8979.57,9002.56,I want to express my appreciation for the focus on the Duwamish Valley and the work of the green new deal advisory board and also in addition to the recommendations coming out of the executive but also the community focused on necessary investments in this area.,142,,
1085,0.97,9002.56,9004.261,I have a couple questions about a couple of these line items.,142,,
1086,0.97,9004.261,9012.47,First the expansion of the Duwamish Valley youth Corps item.,142,,
1087,0.97,9012.47,9016.173,I am finding this quite confusing.,142,,
1088,0.97,9016.173,9026.684,I was notified earlier this year that the Duwamish Valley youth Corps funding that normally they get their Hsd they did not get that.,142,,
1089,0.97,9026.684,9037.228,"I think it was about $112,000.",142,,
1090,0.97,9037.862,9048.672,"They were directed to apply to Osd for grants that we were told would provide maximum funding of $75,000.",142,,
1091,0.97,9048.672,9063.02,"I am confused why they were directed to apply to a grand source that would not give them full funding at the one of the $12,000 level that they previously received at Hsd.",142,,
1092,0.97,9063.02,9072.797,"If there is funding in his budget, why did they have to go and apply for the grant program?",142,,
1093,0.97,9072.797,9079.804,"Am also concerned this suggests that the Duwamish Valley youth Corps is getting $500,000.",142,,
1094,0.97,9079.804,9091.215,On this slide my staff has checked the budget description and additional detail and Texted me information.,142,,
1095,0.97,9091.215,9128.352,"It looks like the $500,000 is much broader than simply the funding that the youth Corps is receiving very interested in knowing how much funding the youth Corps is receiving planned just the question of why did they have to go through this so the bureaucracy of the applying for a grant that would not make them--would not fund them wholly to what the 2021 levels were, if there was a plan to fund them in the budget.",142,,
1096,0.97,9138.329,9154.111,There is heavy trucks going through residential neighborhoods and working to Incentivize the use of electric vehicles.,142,,
1097,0.97,9158.382,9205.963,"I am wondering how the city will verify this program for the vehicle rebate program that the Barrett vehicle operators receiving the rebate are operating within the area to make sure that for the intent of the rebate is to provide an incentive to do the conversion of trucks to electric and as a way to minimize the use of carbon emitting trucks or exhaust emitting trucks in a residential area, I want to make sure we have a way of Verifying those are the ones getting the rebate.",142,,
1098,0.97,9205.963,9219.944,"And finally as it relates to the $3 million, the Council has voted on a couple of different investments in the last couple of weeks.",142,,
1099,0.97,9219.944,9233.991,I think we voted on some investments that the office of housing was leading on for South Park housing development project.,142,,
1100,0.97,9233.991,9240.864,Then there was parks funding piece for acquisition of property that we voted on.,142,,
1101,0.97,9240.864,9264.521,"I just wanted to get a sense, are these additive onto the things we recently voted on or are these just calling out the dollars that have moved from the actions the Council took but moving them into the 2022 budget?",142,,
1102,0.97,9264.521,9267.024,They are designed to become from injury.,143,,
1103,0.97,9267.024,9270.728,You will get more detail this afternoon.,143,,
1104,0.97,9270.728,9278.802,On more of the project specifics.,143,,
1105,0.97,9278.802,9281.839,"Vehicle incentive, I asked that question.",143,,
1106,0.97,9281.839,9295.953,The details of the program formulation are underway . They were decisions made in the last couple months.,143,,
1107,0.97,9295.953,9302.559,We have not had an opportunity to flush out the incentives but that is exactly right.,143,,
1108,0.97,9302.559,9310.968,There are some vehicles that spend time in the neighborhood.,143,,
1109,0.97,9310.968,9321.078,"But we need to target those vehicles . in terms of Duwamish Valley youth Corps in the funding, I have to see the timing.",143,,
1110,0.97,9321.078,9332.79,"Part of that is initial guidance was provided or suggested, we were still in the budget development and did not know this was going to be the case.",143,,
1111,0.97,9332.79,9334.291,It was a shift in approach.,143,,
1112,0.97,9334.291,9346.403,We are recognizing this is an area that need significant investment to address what had been Long-Standing issues.,143,,
1113,0.97,9346.403,9349.406,This is a shift and a different approach.,143,,
1114,0.97,9349.406,9357.614,And depending on timing that may be reflective.,143,,
1115,0.97,9357.614,9363.721,Just a quick follow up.,144,,
1116,0.97,9363.721,9374.732,I think some of my South Park constituents who either volunteer for our work for the youth Corps maybe watching.,144,,
1117,0.97,9374.732,9378.669,I don't think it is accurate to suggest that the youth Corps is getting a fivefold increase.,144,,
1118,0.97,9378.669,9384.441,I will provide additional clarity this afternoon.,145,,
1119,0.97,9384.441,9391.515,I am a few inches deep and many Tousand miles wide.,145,,
1120,0.97,9391.515,9397.221,The last thing I want to do is provide bad information.,145,,
1121,0.97,9397.221,9398.422,"If there is a correction, it will be done this afternoon.",145,,
1122,0.97,9398.422,9399.757,I appreciate you calling that out.,145,,
1123,0.97,9399.757,9404.762,Thank you.,146,,
1124,0.97,9404.762,9405.596,I am not sing additional questions.,146,,
1125,0.97,9405.596,9409.666,We are getting near the end . We have about 15 minutes left.,146,,
1126,0.97,9409.666,9413.036,There should be time for questions at the end.,146,,
1127,0.97,9413.036,9416.106,We will keep going unless there is something else on the slide.,146,,
1128,0.97,9416.106,9416.34,No.,147,,
1129,0.97,9416.34,9417.641,I am good to go.,147,,
1130,0.97,9417.641,9432.389,I will shift talking about individual proposals of funding and give you a sense of funding sources and how they have been allocated.,147,,
1131,0.97,9432.389,9436.16,Some of what I will describe will refer to things I talked about in some is new.,147,,
1132,0.97,9436.16,9438.095,We have a whole briefing for you coming up on Federal funding.,147,,
1133,0.97,9438.095,9457.014,Not just on the second tranche of the Coronavirus local relief recovery funds but also on the first tranche of the previous dollars as well as FEMA work and the work done for reimbursement.,147,,
1134,0.97,9457.014,9471.929,"But high level so you know what is in the proposed tranche, second drones . This is just over $116 million.",147,,
1135,0.97,9471.929,9473.497,"As previously highlighted, 50+ million dollars is for affordable housing.",147,,
1136,0.97,9473.497,9479.136,This represents a piece of what I would describe as a shift and a purposeful one.,147,,
1137,0.97,9479.136,9483.841,The first tranche of Federal money was largely focused on immediate relief.,147,,
1138,0.97,9483.841,9508.465,Second tranche we are continuing to make community investments UT thinking more about the longer run and the real opportunity that one-time funding opportunity provides . I emphasize one time because it provides a challenge of using these resources for programs that may want to be ongoing and I recognize that could be a funding cliff has resources fall off.,147,,
1139,0.97,9508.465,9520.844,Affordable housing as a one- time use seems like an ideal opportunity . The city has an affordable housing crisis . has a homelessness crisis.,147,,
1140,0.97,9520.844,9529.419,"And using these resources, $50 million in housing, that could last for 30+ years.",147,,
1141,0.97,9529.419,9533.991,On top of that Transformational opportunity there is a stimulus opportunity.,147,,
1142,0.97,9533.991,9538.595,The actual building of housing and hire people and pay them.,147,,
1143,0.97,9538.595,9542.299,There is that element as well.,147,,
1144,0.97,9542.299,9545.769,For all those reasons it makes a lot of sense.,147,,
1145,0.97,9545.769,9553.21,"That said, we are looking for long-term immediate relief and that is an issue.",147,,
1146,0.97,9553.21,9554.344,There is $25 million for shelter and food assistance.,147,,
1147,0.97,9554.344,9562.92,That is part of what supports the things above and the continuation of the Covid related facilities that we had stood up.,147,,
1148,0.97,9562.92,9564.588,That is a piece.,147,,
1149,0.97,9564.588,9567.891,We have been thoughtful.,147,,
1150,0.97,9567.891,9571.929,The bulk of the money gets spent in 2022.,147,,
1151,0.97,9571.929,9580.404,But the share of it consistent with the following requirements Úthe anticipation is it gets spent in 2023 and even a small portion in 2024.,147,,
1152,0.97,9580.404,9590.948,It is supporting a set of shelter activities and shelters slots that we are unsure whether we want that in the long run or not.,147,,
1153,0.97,9590.948,9597.154,But we don't want a significant or dramatic funding cliff at the end of any given year.,147,,
1154,0.97,9597.154,9607.864,The end of 2022 we would need Additionalcity money to sustain what is funded here.,147,,
1155,0.97,9607.864,9609.399,We are caring some amount of money into 2023 and the same in 2024.,147,,
1156,0.97,9609.399,9622.579,A step down strategy and working with the regional agency to determine what is the right approach as we reach those milestones.,147,,
1157,0.97,9622.579,9623.58,A significant portion for economic recovery.,147,,
1158,0.97,9623.58,9629.052,That includes an increasing emphasis on job training and workforce development.,147,,
1159,0.97,9629.052,9633.49,We are thinking about Longer- term and investing for the longer-term.,147,,
1160,0.97,9633.49,9640.364,With training and job opportunities are what is needed to transform the economy.,147,,
1161,0.97,9640.364,9645.902,Potentially some roles that will not be in place due to the economy shift.,147,,
1162,0.97,9645.902,9653.276,But investing in people for the long run as well.,147,,
1163,0.97,9653.276,9658.715,$7.5 million is for business assistance . But particularly more targeted.,147,,
1164,0.97,9658.715,9665.922,More significant support for fewer businesses . The math works that way.,147,,
1165,0.97,9665.922,9672.095,More funding of your beneficiaries for trying to make more Transformational changes.,147,,
1166,0.97,9672.095,9684.141,Support that would help businesses achieve ownership potentially of the facilities they operate from or make significant capital investment that would allow them to expand their operation.,147,,
1167,0.97,9684.141,9701.324,Also in the short term additional cash support for the Childcare providers . We will not get people back to work and not get people back to the office without an effectively operating Childcare network.,147,,
1168,0.97,9701.324,9704.861,That network has been significantly stressed by Covid.,147,,
1169,0.97,9704.861,9721.111,Reduced staffing constraints associated with--I know this well for my own personal circumstance . teachers not being able to work across classrooms . all of those things are cost drivers.,147,,
1170,0.97,9721.111,9722.779,Additional financial support.,147,,
1171,0.97,9722.779,9729.686,We are facing additional city costs on a more ongoing basis.,147,,
1172,0.97,9729.686,9733.49,The resources allocated particularly on the it side.,147,,
1173,0.97,9733.49,9747.304,Some of that is hardware . When computers reach the end of their lives we are replacing them with laptops other than Desktops to facilitate hybrid work arrangements going forward.,147,,
1174,0.97,9747.304,9756.713,There is an incremental cost of that and it has been built into the rates we collect from departments.,147,,
1175,0.97,9756.713,9757.38,This was not fully anticipated.,147,,
1176,0.97,9757.38,9763.12,It is not just hardware it is also people . There are more calls to the help desk and concern about Cyber security.,147,,
1177,0.97,9763.12,9766.223,Those are real and tangible costs.,147,,
1178,0.97,9766.223,9775.532,We also see proposals for some additional staffing both at the budget office and FAS and in the office of emergency management.,147,,
1179,0.97,9775.532,9781.638,To properly keep track of $400 million of Federal money.,147,,
1180,0.97,9781.638,9784.841,It will require additional staff.,147,,
1181,0.97,9784.841,9793.817,The funding is enough to sustain that staff into 2024 because that will be the reporting period around the Federal money.,147,,
1182,0.97,9793.817,9800.59,We are taking a leadership role at a national level in terms of being able to get dollars out the door.,147,,
1183,0.97,9800.59,9814.171,I want to match that and account for these resources and meet the requirements of the Federal Government and also to be transparent to the public about how we use that money.,147,,
1184,0.97,9814.171,9818.775,Additional resources for Seattle promise was part of the overall plan around tranche one.,147,,
1185,0.97,9818.775,9825.282,Affordability portal . was partially funded with the first tranche.,147,,
1186,0.97,9825.282,9846.002,The idea is to build effectively a Website but a portal where residents can apply for the cities in calm quality programs with one form . that as long been a dream.,147,,
1187,0.97,9846.002,9852.676,Using resources to make one- time investments that will have long-term impact . and setting aside some resources for impact evaluations.,147,,
1188,0.97,9852.676,9863.987,We are setting up programs using this money that could become ongoing and we need to know what works and what does not.,147,,
1189,0.97,9863.987,9867.824,And funding for the clean city program.,147,,
1190,0.97,9867.824,9884.741,We will give you a more detailed accounting of this tranche and the overall Federal pictures but I want you to get a sense of the aforementioned funding items all fit together as a package for this Federal resource.,147,,
1191,0.97,9884.741,9887.244,Thank you very much.,148,,
1192,0.97,9887.244,9899.923,I want to go back to the question that Councilmember Herbold asked earlier about FEMA and the use of the Federal funds.,148,,
1193,0.97,9899.923,9905.362,Did you question get answered or is there any additional information?,148,,
1194,0.97,9905.362,9915.038,I was reminded that I believe you said my questions about FEMA assumptions will be answered on this slide.,149,,
1195,0.97,9915.038,9915.505,Not this slide.,150,,
1196,0.97,9915.505,9920.977,The additional briefing that we will go into deeper depth on this slide.,150,,
1197,0.97,9920.977,9923.947,Got it . My apologies.,151,,
1198,0.97,9923.947,9932.455,The whole presentation on Federal funding is a comprehensive pitcher.,152,,
1199,0.97,9932.455,9964.454,"We have made a calendar when we submit FEMA reimbursement and based on what we know about the past history and their expectations, a calendar for when the reimbursements would come . depending on where they are in the stage of the process, we assigned a different probability about the reimbursement.",152,,
1200,0.97,9964.654,9966.489,There is a cash flow model about the FEMA reimbursement.,152,,
1201,0.97,9966.489,9972.629,And we can show you all that.,152,,
1202,0.97,9972.629,9982.939,I knew the level of detail--this is a lot of money and it is important to see how it fits together.,152,,
1203,0.97,9982.939,9991.348,Thank you for the clarification.,153,,
1204,0.97,9991.348,9997.954,The next slide is my last.,154,,
1205,0.97,9997.954,10001.558,That is it.,154,,
1206,0.97,10001.558,10010.667,I want to talk more about Jumpstart.,154,,
1207,0.97,10010.667,10033.189,If you take the ordinance passed in July and set up a formula for the allocation of Jumpstart payroll resources and in particular based on the revenue forecast of General fund would have a certain amount of funding directed to the general Fund and the remainder allocated across these four broad categories that were called out.,154,,
1208,0.97,10033.189,10040.497,Overall the budget on the overall basis fully informed by the policy direction reaches those funding targets.,154,,
1209,0.97,10040.497,10045.668,As I highlighted there is almost $100 million for affordable housing.,154,,
1210,0.97,10045.668,10058.848,There is a little bit that is for homelessness . We expand that definition slightly.,154,,
1211,0.97,10059.549,10062.886,"Economic recovery, $24 million.",154,,
1212,0.97,10062.886,10064.387,You can read the others.,154,,
1213,0.97,10064.387,10071.728,"We did not, in reaching those targets they are not exclusively funded from the payroll tax.",154,,
1214,0.97,10071.728,10091.514,"As we were balancing the funding and policy priorities, including those identified in the Jumpstart ordinance, those counsel actions around expanding homeless services, endorsement of the Eci task force recommendation.",154,,
1215,0.97,10091.514,10098.922,Your interest--I am realizing there is a slide missing.,154,,
1216,0.97,10098.922,10104.828,Can we go one more slide? to see if I got them out of order.,154,,
1217,0.97,10104.828,10107.03,Is that the last slide?,154,,
1218,0.97,10107.03,10112.769,I believe that is the last slide.,155,,
1219,0.97,10112.769,10119.342,Can you go up one more?,156,,
1220,0.97,10119.342,10126.983,This is a bit unusual.,156,,
1221,0.97,10126.983,10147.604,Let me see if I can find in my materials and grab the screen to put up another slide to highlight the Bipoc investments.,156,,
1222,0.97,10147.604,10148.805,I think I have some information that would be helpful.,156,,
1223,0.97,10148.805,10161.217,Let me see whether I can find that file really quick . sorry for the delay.,156,,
1224,0.97,10161.217,10166.422,We can also start with that slide in the second session.,157,,
1225,0.97,10166.422,10176.9,Give me just one moment.,158,,
1226,0.97,10183.907,10187.41,I am happy to filibuster with a question in the meantime.,159,,
1227,0.97,10187.41,10191.047,Please do.,160,,
1228,0.97,10191.047,10194.15,Long ago I worked in radio.,161,,
1229,0.97,10194.15,10199.822,And I know what dead air is like.,161,,
1230,0.97,10199.822,10216.272,"On the slide about the Federal relief priorities, how we check to see whether or not the priorities on this slide map to the priorities of the Council and resolution 31999?",161,,
1231,0.97,10216.272,10223.346,"Councilmember Herbold, I have not done that crosswalk with this proposal.",162,,
1232,0.97,10223.346,10237.427,"What I have done is checked--the Councl provided additional direction in the Seattle rescue plan that appropriated funds that was informed by that resolution, as you will recall.",162,,
1233,0.97,10237.427,10258.214,"There are a couple of specific things that were asked for and included at least $60 million in total for affordable housing between the two tranches . This is $50 million plus $30 million . The combined proposal exceeds the direction, the minimum that was set by the Council.",162,,
1234,0.97,10258.214,10269.425,Tere is also direction on providing some funding for the keep moving streets work that was discussed.,162,,
1235,0.97,10269.425,10288.911,I have not talked yet with the central staff analyst who asked to see if there is other funding for that use and there was some direction about the older Americans act funding . We will take that up in the discussion with Hsd.,162,,
1236,0.97,10288.911,10298.121,"In general, aside from the keep moving streets direction, it is consistent with that and we will do a crosswalk with the resolution.",162,,
1237,0.97,10298.121,10307.13,"Many of these things are consistent with the first Seattle rescue plan, which was mostly consistent with the resolution with a couple of exceptions.",162,,
1238,0.97,10307.13,10311.367,Seattle promise being one of them.,162,,
1239,0.97,10311.367,10315.672,Let's go to the last side.,163,,
1240,0.97,10315.672,10320.243,Real quick on the Bipoc investments.,163,,
1241,0.97,10320.243,10325.281,We have another presentation on this . You will hear more of this.,163,,
1242,0.97,10325.281,10334.157,There was $100 million identified in the Mayor's last proposed budget.,163,,
1243,0.97,10334.157,10334.824,Counsel modified some of that.,163,,
1244,0.97,10334.824,10336.793,I want to touch on those issues briefly.,163,,
1245,0.97,10336.793,10347.47,"On Participatory budgeting, the proposed budget includes an additional $30 million of 2022 money for Participatory budgeting.",163,,
1246,0.97,10347.47,10350.807,This will be in addition to the 2021 resource.,163,,
1247,0.97,10350.807,10372.328,Among the reasons we thought it was important to do that was to establish that funding again as an ongoing part of the base budget . The expectation is that the majority and the recommendations that come forward from the Participatory budgeting process will be for some form of ongoing programming.,163,,
1248,0.97,10372.328,10373.629,That may not be the case but we wanted to build that in.,163,,
1249,0.97,10373.629,10387.844,"If that is the case, that $30 million needs to be an ongoing part of the base budget.",163,,
1250,0.97,10387.844,10397.253,That effectively means that the 2021 resource which is about $27 million remains unspent becomes a one time resource to the Participatory budget in process.,163,,
1251,0.97,10397.253,10399.856,It would be for counsel to determine.,163,,
1252,0.97,10399.856,10404.761,It can be used to pay for the actual process itself.,163,,
1253,0.97,10404.761,10408.064,"The outrage to the community, staffing associated with that.",163,,
1254,0.97,10408.064,10424.046,That expense would no longer be deducted from the amount that can be awarded through the decisions that are made . It also provides the opportunity to use some share of the 2021 money or a one-time funding proposal that comes through the Participatory budgeting process.,163,,
1255,0.97,10424.046,10437.293,There could be funding for ongoing programs and funding for one-time capital.,163,,
1256,0.97,10437.293,10438.394,The robust opportunity for Participatory budgeting.,163,,
1257,0.97,10438.394,10440.563,I want to highlight that is funded.,163,,
1258,0.97,10440.563,10454.71,"The equitable city task force recommendations that Council endorsed, releasing a proviso for $30 million of ongoing activities . those are also supported on an ongoing basis in the budget.",163,,
1259,0.97,10454.71,10459.615,We mentioned a couple of those already.,163,,
1260,0.97,10459.615,10463.82,Those are funded.,163,,
1261,0.97,10463.82,10471.527,The $10 million for community safety investments we talked about earlier was a portion of those resources and is continued on an ongoing basis.,163,,
1262,0.97,10471.527,10485.708,"And the strategic investment fund had been $30 million allocation in 2021, restructured slightly but designed to continue . that is what made me think of this and I regret not having a slide.",163,,
1263,0.97,10485.708,10496.953,"The equitable development initiative, $14 million shown on the slide is funded as a portion of the restructured strategic investment fund.",163,,
1264,0.97,10496.953,10514.437,That was targeting many of the same communities and types of projects that the equitable development initiative has and we thought it made more sense and counsel identified ongoing funding for Edi as a Jumpstart priority.,163,,
1265,0.97,10514.437,10525.982,We saw an opportunity to bring them into alignment rather than running two separate programs and it made more sense to have a single initiative more Robustly funded.,163,,
1266,0.97,10525.982,10540.496,The $14 million plus $5 million of ongoing funding from the short term rental tax means there is almost $20 million and that can support more than 20 million annually to be invested in the equitable development initiative.,163,,
1267,0.97,10540.496,10555.211,The remaining portion of what had been the strategic investment fund is going to the office of housing for the displacement issue.,163,,
1268,0.97,10555.211,10556.412,The strategy was informed by the Jumpstart priorities.,163,,
1269,0.97,10556.412,10562.118,Recognizing that there was an alignment between those priorities and many of the underlying policy goals of the strategic investment fund.,163,,
1270,0.97,10562.118,10574.83,"Returning to this issue, these funding amounts in the budget for each of these priorities, they are supported by a mix of the Federal resources and the payroll tax.",163,,
1271,0.97,10574.83,10583.139,The relative mix depends in no small part on the eligibility of the Federal resources.,163,,
1272,0.97,10583.139,10591.747,They work well for affordable housing and they don't work as well for Edi and the green new deal.,163,,
1273,0.97,10591.747,10626.615,"The overall issue was we are Aligning resources available with relative to streets on his resources or constraints on the Federal side, fewer outside constraints on the payroll tax to try to find and to successfully fund the priorities that were called out in Jumpstart and the road is identified through the Bipoc work and increased emphasis on addressing the needs of those living unsheltered and a number of other areas like the Duwamish Valley investments.",163,,
1274,0.97,10626.615,10632.655,There were priorities that expended beyond Jumpstart that we thought needed attention as well.,163,,
1275,0.97,10632.655,10640.296,We are trying to be as creative as possible with the resources that existed to meet those needs.,163,,
1276,0.97,10640.296,10647.37,"I made this point earlier and I want to highlight it now, this works well for 2022.",163,,
1277,0.97,10647.37,10655.778,We are able to achieve these funding levels and able to achieve the commitment on the Bipoc strategies.,163,,
1278,0.97,10655.778,10667.089,The 2023 and beyond it does not work without some real thoughtful consideration of what are the sustainable priorities and where should resources be directed.,163,,
1279,0.97,10667.089,10675.531,Our budget proposal includes legislation to modify the Jumpstart allocations for 2022.,163,,
1280,0.97,10675.531,10678.567,We need that in order to be bold balanced.,163,,
1281,0.97,10678.567,10690.413,Proposal doesn't allocate resources for 2023 and beyond because we think it is too soon to do that.,163,,
1282,0.97,10690.413,10701.157,The next Mayor needs to work with counsel to determine what are the collective priorities and how can resources be allocated and potentially new resources to bring to the mix.,163,,
1283,0.97,10701.157,10717.039,I am highlighting and being creative about trying to meet the priorities.,163,,
1284,0.97,10717.039,10723.979,With that I will be happy to take questions.,163,,
1285,0.97,10723.979,10724.48,Just a few comments.,164,,
1286,0.97,10724.48,10729.585,These are not directed to director noble they are comments for colleagues.,164,,
1287,0.97,10729.585,10746.168,"As we think about the next few days and developing our analysis of how the proposed budget Aligns with the Council and community goals and values, I know colleagues, it will matter as to the color of money.",164,,
1288,0.97,10746.168,10760.816,It matters where the dollars come from and how they are being allocated to accomplish the goals listed on the funding targets.,164,,
1289,0.97,10760.816,10761.517,These were codified in statute.,164,,
1290,0.97,10761.517,10770.96,"In terms of the Jumpstart funding, I think the intent was to be additive to existing general fund.",164,,
1291,0.97,10829.218,10845.701,"While there may be alignments, I think the Council has an opportunity to really dive in to make sure we are accomplishing the goals of seeing growth in those areas for existing priorities.",165,,
1292,0.97,10845.701,10857.479,"For checks that cash before, these need to be investments for our communities, specifically in housing.",165,,
1293,0.97,10857.479,10876.599,"The total goal for affordable housing estimates was estimated to be about 95 direct investments to affordable housing, 3 million as noted in the slide, I think we have the opportunity for housing later, I will be asking questions.",165,,
1294,0.97,10876.599,10891.347,"Information provided today, the proposed budget ALLOCATES 45 million, instead of 98 million for their proposed tax.",165,,
1295,0.97,10891.347,10909.965,"Of the payroll tax, the 6 million to cover the cost of services, and care, with housing dollars, but 45 million is about half of what we anticipated in this section.",165,,
1296,0.97,10909.965,10952.508,"I think there's a lot of further analysis to do to see where we can be additive to accomplish the goals that were envisioned in this community, in addition to making sure those funds are going into areas to rebuild and invest a more equitable Seattle, I actually agree there is going to be shared alignment, I think our next emphasis really identifies the money has come from, to truly be more robust and counting boxes.",165,,
1297,0.97,10952.508,10957.212,Councilmember Mar Ellis?,165,,
1298,0.97,10957.212,11018.374,"Thank you, I was going to address all of that what you just did, I would just say that I want to appreciate the acknowledgment from the Mayor's office about the importance about maintaining the practice as an ongoing part of our base budget planning, lots of conversation last year to begin the process, as we move forward, to share it decision-making with community and how we get to the 30 million to be involved in and interested to move forward, important acknowledgment, we do budgeting here on out.",166,,
1299,0.97,11018.374,11026.382,I just want to signal my intent to keep that front and center as we are talking about how we make community investments and who gets to be part of those conversations.,166,,
1300,0.97,11026.382,11043.699,"I know you had another slide, maybe we can incorporate it into a presentation if we find it but I want to thank you for walking us through this high level overview today.",167,,
1301,0.97,11043.699,11047.903,More detail behind the slides and that's the intent of our afternoon session all day tomorrow and all day Friday.,167,,
1302,0.97,11047.903,11053.275,Do you have anything to close us out with or anything else he wanted to say?,167,,
1303,0.97,11053.275,11065.621,"My description of how the 100 million is continued in various forms, there is a detailed briefing coming up about the community led investment, I will show you that in more detail.",168,,
1304,0.97,11065.621,11080.235,"The other thing I wanted to do was to echo some of your colleagues comments, what I presented today is just my work, it's the work of many in the budget office, many across the city.",168,,
1305,0.97,11080.235,11087.443,It reflects work we have done in consultation with central staff.,168,,
1306,0.97,11087.443,11100.923,"So, just want to express appreciation for all of that work and to acknowledge this marks the second year in a row that we in the budget office have balanced the budget in a remote environment.",168,,
1307,0.97,11100.923,11115.037,"It is a real challenge and a stress, we have help not only balance those two budgets but the crisis created by Covid-19.",168,,
1308,0.97,11115.037,11118.674,Just want to acknowledge the work of the team here and appreciate your support and acknowledgment as well.,168,,
1309,0.97,11118.674,11119.875,"Again, welcoming the partnership going forward.",168,,
1310,0.97,11119.875,11123.045,Thank you and more to come.,168,,
1311,0.97,11123.045,11145.0,"That sounds wonderful, again, I know there is a whole team behind your efforts here in the slides today, so we honor the appreciation, this will be ongoing as we seek to understand the proposed budget in front of us and Redraft of the next two months.",169,,
1312,0.97,11145.0,11145.767,"Colleagues, any final comments?",169,,
1313,0.97,11145.767,11151.206,"Allie, any final comments from you?",169,,
1314,0.97,11151.206,11159.281,"Okay, I will just say for all of those watching Online who may be get the sense this feels like the first day of school, we are going to go into recess.",169,,
