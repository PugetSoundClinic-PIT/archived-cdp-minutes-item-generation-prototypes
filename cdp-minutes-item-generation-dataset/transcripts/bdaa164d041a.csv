28,0.97,101.868,104.971,I want to welcome everyone back from our summer Recess.,20,,
29,0.97,104.971,117.383,"I hope each of you had an opportunity, you and your staff and all of the staff to take advantage of a two-week Recess.",20,,
30,0.97,117.383,134.601,I am happy to see you all again and look forward to getting back to work on all the priorities that we have at the city council on behalf of the city and look forward to working with all of you and the remainder of the year.,20,,
31,0.97,134.601,152.318,I want to provide quickly and update regarding the three Council bills that the Mayor vetoed and returned to the city council in the middle of August right before the summer Recess.,20,,
32,0.97,152.318,156.923,"Those are Council bills 119, 825-862 and 863.",20,,
33,0.97,156.923,198.765,"We have done this before in terms of considering or reconsidering vetoed bills and as you know, the city charter establishes that the Council shall take action on any bills that have been previously vetoed and we must reconsider any vetoed bills so that means we have to reconsider the three bills that were vetoed by the Mayor and have to do so within 30 days of the official notices which were published in this instance on August 25 of 2020.",20,,
34,0.97,198.765,210.777,I do not anticipate that the Council will take action on these three bills before the rally scheduled city Councilman on September 21.,20,,
35,0.97,210.777,225.391,"Again, I think the soonest we will take action is Monday of Strattera 21st and I understand from the math and my staff can correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that the outside date of when we can last take action is September 24.",20,,
36,0.97,225.391,244.41,I just want to make sure that you all understood what the Charter requires of us and what you can expect in terms of when we would reconsider those vetoed bills.,20,,
37,0.97,244.41,255.688,My office had frequent Medications with the Mayor's office to try to find areas of agreement on the public safety related policies and priorities at the Council put forward in the three vetoed bills.,20,,
38,0.97,255.688,291.024,We still don't have agreement but we have been having frequent communications and my staff and I will continue to engage with you and your staff and the Mayor's office in the coming days to try to see if there's an opportunity to bridge the obvious gaps in policy priorities that exist between the Council and the Mayor's vision on how to redefine and Reprioritize the services and investments as reflected in the various Council bills.,20,,
39,0.97,291.024,302.568,I am happy to take any questions or hear any comments before we get into the preview of today's city council actions and Council and regional committees.,20,,
40,0.97,302.568,312.278,"All right, hearing on, I'm Sir folks might have something to say later.",20,,

44,0.97,318.951,324.49,All Council numbers for the meetings with just doesn't it Alphabetically by last name with Council President always counted last.,22,,
45,0.97,324.49,344.811,"This rotation begins with Councilmember Herbold and then Debora Juarez, Lewis, Mosqueda, Alex Pederson, Dan Strauss and then I will go.",22,,
46,0.97,344.811,345.345,Councilmember Herbold.,22,,

49,0.97,349.515,351.684,It's good to see all of your faces.,23,,
50,0.97,351.684,358.424,"Now that I am beginning to speak, my cat is also beginning to speak so bear with me.",23,,
51,0.97,358.424,364.363,There are no items on the Council agenda from the public safety committee.,23,,
52,0.97,364.363,392.558,There is an item that I am a cosponsor for and I am certain that Councilmember Pederson will speak more trip with this is going to fund the stabilization work on the West Seattle bridge as well as funding for a lot of the traffic projects that are part of Reconnect West Seattle.,23,,
53,0.97,392.558,413.88,"This legislation is alone to fund these elements and it uses $50,000 from the inspections Fund and $50 million from the Contractions inspections Fund and 20 million from the capital project Fund.",23,,
54,0.97,413.88,424.891,"Other items coming up for me this week, I do have a public safety and human services committee meeting this week on Friday at 9:30 A.M.",23,,
55,0.97,424.891,429.562,Due to the labor day holiday.,23,,
56,0.97,429.562,442.108,Items on the agenda include a possible presentation from the Seattle fire Department and Seattle information technology on the emergency radio network.,23,,
57,0.97,442.108,461.494,Otherwise known as the international agreement with the service and this is a project that the fire Department has been working on for several years and the Interlocal agreement is an important benchmark.,23,,
58,0.97,461.494,479.512,"In addition, we will be hearing from each of the police Commission and office of Inspector general and police their reports and conditions to regarding the use of crowd control weapons.",23,,
59,0.97,479.512,502.101,These reports resulted from a request from this Council in the crowd control weapons the decision that we passed and I'm looking forward to hearing feedback on this legislation.,23,,
60,0.97,502.101,521.988,"On 19 August, you may recall I sent an Email inviting Councilmembers to let me and Greg Doss of central staff know of any questions regarding the conditions of the accountability bodies and my staff will send out a reminder so please send questions by noon on Wednesday.",23,,
61,0.97,521.988,541.474,There will be obviously an interest in hearing from the CPC and OPA in response to the Council's questions in time for the Friday committee meeting so we want to make sure we get a little bit of time on that.,23,,
62,0.97,541.474,559.725,I wanted to very briefly speak to an article in the Seattle times regarding the police Department that I know we all read during the break and I have been in touch with both with the city auditor and chief Diaz about this issue.,23,,
63,0.97,559.725,607.974,The chief has indicated that he has initiated more intensive oversight of daily overtime use and I appreciate his intention to this so soon after becoming active chief and want to understand more detail about what it means to have more intensive oversight of daily overtime use given what we learned in the Seattle times about the extreme delay in acting on Recommedations from the auditor report on overtime for 2016 with 30 recommendations and several of which were implement to quickly but are still listed as pending.,23,,
64,0.97,607.974,624.69,We received an update in December and it was a status update as of December 2019 and we received at least in April.,23,,
65,0.97,624.69,639.572,"It notes for all the work of the city auditor dies, it goes Úthrough and identifies which recommendations haven't acted upon and which ones are either in progress were pending.",23,,
66,0.97,639.572,660.292,The status update that we received in the spring notes that the city auditor report has seven recommendations that are listed as pending and many of those were conditioned to relate to work with the Seattle information technology Department to apply any work and Timekeeping system.,23,,
67,0.97,660.292,665.931,The status report notes that the new solution will contain automated controls for detecting payroll errors and noncompliance.,23,,
68,0.97,665.931,673.906,The city auditor shared in its status report in the spring that Seattle I.T.,23,,
69,0.97,673.906,687.753,Reported that there was a competitive selection process for technology systems in September 2018 and has finalized the contract with the vendor.,23,,
70,0.97,687.753,703.569,That work has started in January 2019 at that point the expected delivery date of the project completion had slipped due to complications with the project and the city auditor reported that the new completion date is expected to come in the following months.,23,,
71,0.97,703.569,709.675,Chief Diaz recently noted that the I.T.,23,,
72,0.97,709.675,725.291,Project intended to help the management issues has been delayed consistent with the city auditor's update to us and the date that chief Diaz is giving for deployment which is quarter one of 2021.,23,,
73,0.97,725.291,739.705,There are some other recommendations in the audit that don't actually rely on this new system.,23,,
74,0.97,739.705,756.088,One of them is related to tracking off-duty work hours and there is a policy that States that personnel is required to log in and out by radio when working off-duty.,23,,
75,0.97,756.088,796.162,"The city auditor suggested this would be an option for tracking off-duty time and an option that is distinct from the technology solution and so, I am also interested to know whether or not this policy is being adhered to and whether or not we are ensuring that officers are logging in and out by radio when working on duty and in this off-duty piece which is separate from the Off- duty piece, they were together because there are limits to the number of hours including overtime and off-duty work.",23,,
76,0.97,796.162,843.976,"I'm really trusted to know whether or not any work that has been done on that and then Finally, I believe in the end of 2017, the executive order from the Mayor related to the development of a plan and Timeline for management of Off- duty police officers and we received, the Council received I believe it was in 2018 and I think it was requested in 2018 and received in 2019 but I'm not quite sure about those dates.",23,,
77,0.97,843.976,867.633,We received a report in response to a statement of legislative intent on what the process was for developing this off-duty time management approach and it appears that we are also behind the intended benchmarks for developing network as well.,23,,
78,0.97,867.633,876.642,I think there is a lot to do here and I am really pleased that chief Diaz is addressing that.,23,,
79,0.97,876.642,900.599,"Also, I am interested to understand more how the redeployment of officers from other units to patrol might also help address these overtime challenges and to what extent we can expect a reduction from the redeployment.",23,,
80,0.97,900.599,930.262,One other thing I wanted to mention regarding the redeployment is that I Anderson the majority of the physicians from the chiefs redeployment and that comes from other patrol like functions either functions within patrol like the CBT team or traffic which is outside of patrol.,23,,
81,0.97,930.262,944.877,There are specialized units that reportedly will be redeployed to control and so I am really interested to know more about the impact.,23,,
82,0.97,944.877,978.243,It is within the chiefs discretion to do these types of Redeployments but I do want to make sure that specialized units that are focused on normal populations that we are not looking to redeployed those officers to patrol because of this Council's concern as expressed in the resolution that we passed with our budget action.,23,,
83,0.97,978.243,1002.368,Trying to emphasize police response to the needs of folks who are part of vulnerable populations and specifically the elderly and domestic violence and sexual assault.,23,,
84,0.97,1002.368,1003.168,Those kinds of cases.,23,,
85,0.97,1003.168,1015.547,"That will be something I'm hoping to get more information from the chief on before those changes take effect in September, I believe the 16th is the date they are estimated.",23,,
86,0.97,1015.547,1050.416,"Other items that I have coming up on my week this week, I do have on Wednesday the regional policy committee meeting and on Thursday the lead policy courting group quarterly meeting and then I have virtual office hours over Recess on August 28, my next office hours will be on Friday, the timber 25th.",23,,
87,0.97,1050.416,1050.783,Thank you.,23,,
88,0.97,1050.783,1053.318,"Thank you, Herbold.",24,,
89,0.97,1053.318,1058.624,Are there any questions or comments on that report?,24,,
90,0.97,1058.624,1064.696,"Hearing none, we will go ahead and hear from Councilmember Juarez, please.",24,,
91,0.97,1064.696,1068.934,"Thank you, good morning.",25,,
92,0.97,1068.934,1072.237,The public aspect and the community committee has no items on today's agenda.,25,,
93,0.97,1072.237,1078.944,"However, we do have two items on today's referral calendar and I will briefly address them.",25,,
94,0.97,1078.944,1103.869,Council bill 119875 which is an ordinance related to the recreation which authorizes amendment to the Interlocal agreement between the parks district allowing for delay in the six year planning cycle of the budget process due to extraordinary circumstances and basically the Coronavirus.,25,,
95,0.97,1103.869,1119.351,We will have more to come and this is back in 2014 where we do the planning and computer cycles and not able to do this through the amendment to the Interlocal agreement for a delay.,25,,
96,0.97,1119.351,1137.603,To allow planning due to the natural disaster and other emergencies and that would be the pandemic that we are under with her inability to have the type of community meeting that we need.,25,,
97,0.97,1137.603,1149.715,The second item is resolution the 1967 and I'm really happy about this.,25,,
98,0.97,1149.715,1159.725,This resolution is providing an investigation of 28 Avenue northeast.,25,,
99,0.97,1159.725,1163.162,This piece is a special community driven bill and I look forward to addressing it next Monday.,25,,
100,0.97,1163.162,1174.806,The honorary Street is to recognize the contribution to the neighborhood and to educate those on the violation of human rights during World War II.,25,,
101,0.97,1174.806,1192.057,The community has been working on this for at least two years or maybe longer and I look forward to speaking more on this next Monday at the briefing and I wanted to thank Chris and a bunch of the folks that have been working on this for condition and honor for this family.,25,,
102,0.97,1192.057,1237.102,"In regards to the ward, there were meetings scheduled for this afternoon which has been canceled and Typicall the board meeting occurs about two times a year to look at the strategic plan in June and then we approve it in a budget that corresponds with the city budget in November and one of the pieces of legislation to be considered will be to make changes to the 2020 district funding that have been included in the balancing legislation which was vetoed by the Mayor and we are waiting for that action.",25,,
103,0.97,1237.102,1243.408,"To streamline the legislative process, we will postpone today's canceled meeting to a later date.",25,,
104,0.97,1243.408,1259.925,The goal is to consider all three pieces of legislation that wants and I didn't want to have a meeting today on some pieces but not all of it and quite frankly I wasn't sure if wicked go on a couple of those.,25,,
105,0.97,1259.925,1282.447,"We will consider the three pieces of legislation at once after the Council considers that 2020 budget hearing matters and as usual, we are missing the parts folks and superintendent and my office will resume sending out a weekly update which I think we have been doing since May.",25,,
106,0.97,1282.447,1284.65,"Other than that--what see, that's all I have.",25,,
107,0.97,1284.65,1286.518,Thank you.,25,,
108,0.97,1286.518,1293.425,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez.",26,,
109,0.97,1293.425,1301.566,Are there any questions or comments on that report?,26,,
110,0.97,1301.566,1302.968,"During none, Councilmember Lewis, good morning.",26,,
111,0.97,1302.968,1304.102,Good morning Madam President.,27,,
112,0.97,1304.102,1305.504,It's good to be back with everybody.,27,,
113,0.97,1305.504,1307.039,I just have a couple of items.,27,,
114,0.97,1307.039,1311.943,"First, there are no items on this afternoon's agenda from the Committee on homeless strategies and investments.",27,,
115,0.97,1311.943,1323.488,I do just want to talk briefly about some of the reporting we saw over the weekend from the city grounds relating to the city shelter efforts.,27,,
116,0.97,1323.488,1390.722,As we are well aware and now that people of Seattle are well aware from the reporting that the temporary community center shelters that were set up back in March to take care of overflow due to the intensification efforts at several shelters are closing down and folks are being sent back to shelters that have adapted to the Covid-19 situation by increasing privacy and space and changing a lot of the shelter stock and I think Cindy's reporting was good at illustrating this and the way that we are seeing a transformation to emphasize longer stays and privacy and things all of us take for granted and are extremely important in having a comprehensive strategy to provide shelter and relief to so many of her neighbors Extrinsic homelessness.,27,,
117,0.97,1390.722,1404.436,The unfortunate downside of this as covered in Cindy's reporting is that only 14 folks moved on from those community center shelters to supportive housing between March and the summer.,27,,
118,0.97,1404.436,1448.213,Not very many given that there were hundreds of folks that moved through those community centers and shelters and really emphasize that we continue to struggle as a city where Covid- 19 has not only resulted in a loss of shelter space but Sydney goes on to say that the company shelter which she uses as an Lustration for a lot of her reporting is actually going to lose 13 spaces as a result of the the intensification which is considerably improved with the stock of their offerings but has reduced the total number of shelter spaces.,27,,
119,0.97,1448.213,1484.616,That is a trend that is being repeated in a lot of our stocks throughout the city and it is no wonder that we are facing so many of our neighbors that are keenly aware and I'm sure everyone is getting the same Emails I'm getting that we are struggling with the massive influx of sentient that are almost certainly corresponding with the fact that the shelters are the intensifying and shrinking in size and we are not able to scale up Non- congregate shelter adequate to replace the loss in shelter stock.,27,,
120,0.97,1484.616,1514.179,"I just wanted to emphasize that even though we are still dealing with the summer bouncing section soon enough, we will be going into the fall budget session to do with the 2021 budget and it has been and will continue to be the intensified Non-Congregate shelter expansion that will be a big priority for me.",27,,
121,0.97,1514.179,1564.229,It is by far the only way that we as a city can start to get ahead on removing and reducing Nonsentient to give people an option to get inside and most people offered a tiny house or some kind of Noncovered get setting will take it and that is a universally held opinion across the provider community and across the navigation team and when you talk to at any level of providing services will confirm that and this myth that is constantly in Emails from folks that are frustrated about about the Encampments alleging that folks want to be in those Encampments and won't go if offer some kind of alternative are false and not any of the reality of what is seen on the ground.,27,,
122,0.97,1564.229,1633.064,"We can start in assessing the vetoed summer bouncing budget bill maintaining the few million dollars that we did put in for the intensification efforts in making sure that remains any part of arrangement be override of the bills were a deal with the executive to move forward on it but that stays in and then going into the fall, making sure we are adjusting to the new reality of Covid-19 where it doesn't make sense anymore and not that it ever truly did for lots of reasons related to dignity best health practices and treating our neighbors like human beings to rely on mats on the floor and temporary shelter stays and other things that have resulted in being blown out of the water because of the Covid-19 situation and the complete lack of vitality anymore for congregate shelters as a viable way to get people inside.",27,,
123,0.97,1633.064,1641.406,"So, that is all I have to report on and I want to thank Jimmy for her reporting.",27,,
124,0.97,1641.406,1647.479,I think she did an excellent job of summarizing the problem that we are facing as a city ad I look forward to continuing to work on that issue.,27,,
125,0.97,1647.479,1688.42,"I have a regional policy meaning on September 9 and I do want to remind folks that in addition to being able to Sign-Up for the office hours that I try to maintain, I am continuing to to the farm market every afternoon from every Thursday afternoon from 3 until 7 PM on Thursday, September 10 and this coming Thursday I will be there so folks that want to come by, I look forward to talking to you in person with the booth we have there.",27,,
126,0.97,1688.42,1690.955,I don't just go there to load up on computer for the week.,27,,
127,0.97,1690.955,1705.57,I go to make sure I have an opportunity to talk One-On-One and those interactions with properly social distancing in a helpful opportunity to be able to get out there and talk to the community in a Nonvirtual way.,27,,
128,0.97,1705.57,1712.277,I definitely encourage people to drop by if there's anything you want to discuss and I look forward to seeing folks there.,27,,
129,0.97,1712.277,1715.146,"With that, I have nothing else to report.",27,,
130,0.97,1715.146,1726.691,"I see that Councilmember Mosqueda has a question or comment and if anyone else has questions or comments, raise your hand or let me know by sending me a message.",28,,
131,0.97,1726.691,1730.795,Thank you.,29,,
132,0.97,1730.795,1734.599,"Councilmember Lewis, thank you for your summary as chair of our efforts regarding homelessness and housing.",29,,
133,0.97,1734.599,1736.835,Can you elaborate a little bit more?,29,,
134,0.97,1736.835,1782.814,"I haven't had a chance to read that cl times piece but when you talk about how we have adopted our Covid-19 response or adopted our shelters to respond to Covid-19 and to have privacy space and longer stays, I'm trying to reconcile that with the newest information that we know that Covid-19 lingers in the air again, calling for us to invest but what exactly is the Mayor's office and executive office saying about how they have adapted the space for indoor shelters when Covid-19 lingers in the air and ongoing best practice is to get people individual rooms.",29,,
135,0.97,1782.814,1784.415,Can you elaborate for that?,29,,
136,0.97,1784.415,1800.231,"Speaking on the reporting in the Seattle times, it speaks more to the efforts of providers are doing.",30,,
137,0.97,1800.231,1828.693,"In the rent shelters, Cindy's reporting covers community services and compass and youth care in particular and talks about some of the efforts to adapt to the Councilmember Morales situation to provide more privacy and it includes testimonials from folks in the shelters attesting to the improvement in the situation.",30,,
138,0.97,1828.693,1847.512,The underlying take away that I took from the article is those the intensification efforts come with a net reduction in the amount of placements we can have so that the quality of the shelters is proving but we are losing spaces.,30,,
139,0.97,1847.512,1877.709,"I think this is critical and I don't think it is completely in response your question but I will say folks that are looking for some kind of rationale to explain why there is this massive increase in camping, it sure seems that it is logical to conclude that this the intensification and smelter space is a big part of this and we need to get a handle on it.",30,,
140,0.97,1877.709,1900.365,"As you know, I continue to be an advocate primarily of tiny House villages and her telling for the kind of modular shelter systems that they have that the chief Seattle club is running.",30,,
141,0.97,1900.365,1921.085,"I think these particular shelter spaces the city was covering are more of a D intensified semi congregate and there are some pictures in the reporting but I think the important take away is any way that you slice it, we are losing shelter placements and need to be doing more as a city.",30,,
142,0.97,1921.085,1950.615,"I know this Council has appropriated forward to appropriate considerable news resources and we need to work out a way as a city to get those up and running and get folks off the street so they can live somewhere where they are safe and not just from Covid-19 but especially as it will get darker, there should be a sense of urgency to this so I appreciate your question.",30,,
143,0.97,1950.615,1954.819,Thank you very much.,31,,
144,0.97,1954.819,1962.06,Are there any comments or other comments or questions for Councilmember Lewis?,32,,
145,0.97,1962.06,1972.837,"Okay, hearing none, we will go ahead and move on to the next Councilmember, Councilmember Juarez, you are up.",32,,
146,0.97,1972.837,1974.372,Thank you and good morning everyone.,33,,
147,0.97,1974.372,1977.342,Good to see you all.,33,,
148,0.97,1977.342,1980.611,There are no items on the agenda today from the community of economic development.,33,,
149,0.97,1980.611,2012.276,"We do have a scheduling for next week, the afternoon of Saturday 15th and we will have several Commission appointments and we are anticipating that the Mayor will transmit legislation to establish a permanent equitable development initiative advisory board and our understanding is that will be transmitted this week so we will be discussing that in committee and hopefully voting on that so we can have it before the Council.",33,,
150,0.97,2012.276,2031.996,"As we come back from recess, I just wanted to share a little bit and I heard loud and clear and I'm sure everyone from their constituents over Recess that our neighbors are really looking for leadership in the city.",33,,
151,0.97,2031.996,2034.565,Leadership that is excellent for five in action and not just rhetoric.,33,,
152,0.97,2034.565,2055.119,I think it is the work that we all have ahead of us and the Mayor has talked a lot about having a plan and I want to say this Council presented a plan to the public on how to Rebalance the budget and we spent two months discussing it.,33,,
153,0.97,2055.119,2075.44,We passed a Rebalance budget that address the & amp; impacts of Covid-19 but also the critical equity and public safety issues that we have all been discussing over the last couple of months.,33,,
154,0.97,2075.44,2077.675,Our democracy is based on collaboration.,33,,
155,0.97,2077.675,2104.469,It is also based on compromise and I know that is not a word that makes a lot of people happy but I will say the Council has had conversations with hundreds of organizations and community members and we took the Mayor's proposed Rebalance budget and collaborated with people in our communities and districts and sought compromise amongst the nine of us.,33,,
156,0.97,2104.469,2136.601,"This was a really important and robust effort and was guided by the best policy and economic practice from around the country and guided by listening to hundreds of hours of community input between public comments and hearing from her own constituents in our districts and working with organizations, it was not simply a veto of this Council but a veto of the collaboration that we were engaged in and frankly of the community.",33,,
157,0.97,2136.601,2140.605,What I hear from my constituents as they felt like this was a rejection of their voices.,33,,
158,0.97,2140.605,2145.51,The Emails and calls and discussions that we had.,33,,
159,0.97,2145.51,2176.173,We know specifically as it relates to the public safety and police Department that this discussion will continue and we have the Rebalance to consider the next couple weeks but also the work ahead of us for the 21 budget and my commitment is to advocate for the resources that our community needs interrupt violence in our neighborhoods but also to build healthy neighborhoods.,33,,
160,0.97,2176.173,2178.142,Violence is rooted in cultural and social and economic conditions.,33,,
161,0.97,2178.142,2188.352,This is an about bad people but systemic racism that has created community conditions that don't serve our neighbors well.,33,,
162,0.97,2188.352,2196.127,Everyone has a role to play to reduce that violence and building healthy communities.,33,,
163,0.97,2196.127,2204.835,This is not just the public safety issue or law enforcement issue and focusing resources only on the police Department will not solve this problem.,33,,
164,0.97,2204.835,2215.58,We have to think beyond that and commit to investing in Holistic changes to see the kind of healthy communities we want to see.,33,,
165,0.97,2215.58,2219.283,I will say it is concerning to me that the Mayor is using the veto so livery.,33,,
166,0.97,2219.283,2228.793,The power of the veto in my mind is to be used Sparingly so it respects community and representative democracy.,33,,
167,0.97,2228.793,2243.074,My mind is frequent use that it plays an insidious pattern that the winner takes all in a democracy or the power can only be exhibited with force.,33,,
168,0.97,2243.074,2248.613,Unilateral policymaking is acceptable.,33,,
169,0.97,2248.613,2253.017,"I think this Council REJECTS that notion speaking for myself, I reject that.",33,,
170,0.97,2253.017,2258.889,This is the legislative branch of city government and we are looking to make policy and budgetary decisions for the city.,33,,
171,0.97,2258.889,2261.692,That is our job.,33,,
172,0.97,2261.692,2268.432,"With that said, I do hope we can find a way to work Collaboratively with the Mayor.",33,,
173,0.97,2268.432,2280.244,People are counting on me to deliver the resources they need for healthy neighborhoods and that will happen best and will work best if we can work Collaboratively with the executive branch.,33,,
174,0.97,2280.244,2294.425,"I do think the proposals we towed were initial steps to try to address the community concerns and as I have said before, our neighbors don't want to hear we can't.",33,,
175,0.97,2294.425,2297.261,They want us to get to work and saying no is not leadership.,33,,
176,0.97,2297.261,2302.967,Vetoing things is not the plan.,33,,
177,0.97,2302.967,2306.737,We have important work to do for the people of Seattle and our neighbors want a responsive government.,33,,
178,0.97,2306.737,2317.648,They want investment in programs that support our homeless neighbors and young people and they want opportunities to build community wealth through local economic development.,33,,
179,0.97,2317.648,2324.889,They want a city government that reigns over time cost and hold city employees accountable for egregious behavior.,33,,
180,0.97,2324.889,2334.065,They also want to the safety to protect all people in our city and not just those that live in areas of concentrated wealth.,33,,
181,0.97,2334.065,2349.68,My commitment to my community and the city is to continue working to try to find common ground so we can focus on outcomes we want to see to server neighbors best and work Collaboratively with the executive branch so we can get that sitting.,33,,
182,0.97,2349.68,2353.117,Thank you.,33,,
183,0.97,2353.117,2353.784,Thank you.,34,,
184,0.97,2353.784,2360.825,Are there any questions or comments on Councilmember Morales's report?,34,,
185,0.97,2360.825,2369.6,"Okay, hearing none, we will hear nets from Councilmember Mosqueda, good morning.",34,,
186,0.97,2369.6,2407.171,"Good morning, there are no items on today's agenda from the budget or plan and Finance Committee or from the housing and the next meeting will be on September 15 at 9:30 am where we will be getting a briefing and update on the legislation for basically drivers to make sure they are getting adequate pay and I'm excited about the work we have been doing and what other advocates and to work on this legislation.",35,,
187,0.97,2407.171,2412.243,It has been a long time coming and I wish we had that last fall but there is more activity to come this fall.,35,,
188,0.97,2412.243,2413.677,Looking forward to passing that with your help.,35,,
189,0.97,2413.677,2420.484,"As it relates to the budget, we appreciate the overview and upcoming steps outlined.",35,,
190,0.97,2420.484,2426.157,I also want to echo some of the points that were made by Councilmember Morales.,35,,
191,0.97,2426.157,2446.777,"I know as it relates to the budget or even policies that come out of this branch of government, not everyone agrees with us and that is issues relating to homelessness and affordable housing in the pandemic response and error recovery efforts to make sure we shorten the recession.",35,,
192,0.97,2446.777,2455.719,All of these issues are complex and all are being done and trying to be addressed during a global than the pandemic and there are no easy paths forward on these issues.,35,,
193,0.97,2455.719,2472.136,Any of us that have been working on these policies over the years have said if it were easy to do that I would've already been done so we are here trying to take very important steps to address the compounding public health crisis in front of us and that includes systemic racism.,35,,
194,0.97,2472.136,2473.704,That includes a lack of affordable housing.,35,,
195,0.97,2473.704,2490.254,That good economic inequality that plagues our city and especially black and Brown folks and obviously includes Covid-19 response as well which is having a disproportionate impact on black and Brown communities as well.,35,,
196,0.97,2490.254,2498.963,"As we engage in the next steps on the budget process, but remember that the Council is the legislative branch of government.",35,,
197,0.97,2498.963,2508.539,"Person's responsibility is to make sure that as the Council, we are Deliberating in public and include public comment and have this public comment and collaborative process to guide us as we work on tough issues.",35,,
198,0.97,2508.539,2520.217,"As it relates to collaboration, let's remember that as the legislative branch, we are already collaborative by its very nature.",35,,
199,0.97,2520.217,2524.955,We work to get not just the majority of Council votes but a super majority as it relates to the budget.,35,,
200,0.97,2524.955,2545.075,We have a super majority that requires us to have ongoing conversations with diversity of opinions and ideas reflected in the very nature of her policymaking appropriation required deliberations with public input and collaboration not just amongst us for making sure we are pulling in those voices from the public.,35,,
201,0.97,2545.075,2569.033,"It is important to note that this branch of government is the only body that does our deliberations in public and that we are held accountable to having these conversations and importantly, we have committed to bringing in folks that have been historically marginalized voices that have been left out of the conversation.",35,,
202,0.97,2569.033,2573.604,People that have lived experience and invite them to the table to make sure the policy and budget is informed by those discussions.,35,,
203,0.97,2573.604,2584.181,This last fall were summer process where we invited people to the table wasn't just a handful of people were a dozen or a few dozen and not even 100.,35,,
204,0.97,2584.181,2610.074,It was hundreds of organizations that we consulted with as we worked with coalitions that represented various aspects of our community and folks that haven't lived experiences and how we respond to the budget that revealed word dollars were going and where we wanted them to go.,35,,
205,0.97,2610.074,2628.559,"This summer with that collaborative process in mind, the Council you sleep passed a budget with public input and acting with urgency given the compounding public health crises with the pandemic and police and public safety concerns and the homeless crisis.",35,,
206,0.97,2628.559,2638.702,It is Disheartening that these bills were discarded when the Mayor has executive implantation and spending authority and has offered no plan even going as far as to the spirit the good work that has been done.,35,,
207,0.97,2638.702,2648.479,I want to make sure folks know how much we appreciate all the work and the well Researched work with comprehensive ideas that you all brought forward.,35,,
208,0.97,2648.479,2661.091,I appreciate all of that effort that went into bringing a summer rebalancing budget that has not been done in recent history during the type of compounding crisis we've had.,35,,
209,0.97,2661.091,2678.609,"As I stated branch of government continues to do its work, we will continue to carry out deliberations in public with a process that will be guided but those that have lived experiences and we will roll up our sleeves and do the hard work in the upcoming month and make sure we respond to the crisis with urgency.",35,,
210,0.97,2678.609,2686.45,Including by the way responding to the gun violence crisis which was Referenced in the veto message.,35,,
211,0.97,2686.45,2693.323,But you member the $4 million to respond to the violence in the budget that was recently vetoed.,35,,
212,0.97,2693.323,2709.506,We are not going to put at risk for democratic principles as we try to respond with urgency and will also note that there are many cities across the country that are acting with the same level of urgency and not losing precious time.,35,,
213,0.97,2709.506,2714.645,"New York City, Austin city, Los Angeles city, San Francisco and many other cities have already acted were are acting with urgency.",35,,
214,0.97,2714.645,2732.83,"I am hopeful that we can continue to move forward and I want to make sure folks know this process is not just about tinkering around the edges but this is a dramatic impact--sorry, lack of action has a dramatic impact that we must work to address quickly and I'm always open to collaboration.",35,,
215,0.97,2732.83,2745.776,"If anyone that has worked with the prior to Council, you know the way that I engage with her policymaking is by being aggressively collaborative.",35,,
216,0.97,2745.776,2749.713,I want your input and I wanted early and I want to keep working to get as many voices included.,35,,
217,0.97,2749.713,2761.759,There is a lot to fix here and a lot of work that needs to be done and I'm not interested in pointing fingers or working with folks that want to take things home.,35,,
218,0.97,2761.759,2772.236,We want to work together and it is in the interest of our city to work together but we have to do it with urgency and with folks I have lived these expenses.,35,,
219,0.97,2772.236,2782.412,We will do in a transparent way with public engagement and accountability and having the my way or highway approaches not collaboration.,35,,
220,0.97,2782.412,2788.018,Investing in true community safety and economic recovery and bringing Seattleites to the table is not easy.,35,,
221,0.97,2788.018,2795.225,This is not about Rubberstamping any process but about making fundamental change that has been ignored for many decades.,35,,
222,0.97,2795.225,2817.347,"Change is uncomfortable and if we throw away democratic principles of including various voices of the table and trying to shake up the status quo, we run the risk of those institutions that have harmed so many for so long remaining in place.",35,,
223,0.97,2817.347,2819.483,I want to make sure that we move forward with urgency.,35,,
224,0.97,2819.483,2822.786,That is what we did this summer.,35,,
225,0.97,2822.786,2838.802,We legislated to lessen the harm in our approach to engaging with those in shelter and pushed for more public safety oriented models and develop the plan to center those with good expense from diverse voices to finalize a public safety plan.,35,,
226,0.97,2838.802,2849.112,These are dollars that were included for a collaborative engagement process that would ensure that the budget that comes this fall is led by various voices from across the spectrum.,35,,
227,0.97,2849.112,2872.302,It is unfortunate that these legislative actions were vetoed and it is unfortunate that we are in a position where we need to now act with urgency to make sure these issues will be addressed and Eigen will be prepared to roll up our sleeves and work with our staff and all the offices and our community partners and the Mayor's office.,35,,
228,0.97,2872.302,2878.008,I don't have time for Finger- pointing or political games.,35,,
229,0.97,2878.008,2890.42,We know there is a history of precedent being required of us as elected officials not just in the city but across the country and more is being asked of us.,35,,
230,0.97,2890.42,2898.528,We act with urgency and it is our time to roll up our sleeves and make sure there is not a delay.,35,,
231,0.97,2898.528,2899.129,Collaboration needs more.,35,,
232,0.97,2899.129,2909.072,"We must make sure we are working together to center progressive values in any future conversations about the budget but as the legislative branch, it's our duty to put forward a budget process.",35,,
233,0.97,2909.072,2912.142,It is the executive option to choose how to implement those.,35,,
234,0.97,2912.142,2919.85,I want to make sure as we engage in conversations about what a table looks like for a task force that we don't try to rewrite history.,35,,
235,0.97,2919.85,2935.899,"What has been done in the city in the past specifically to minimum wage was a Mayor who invited all people and even those that he disagreed with to the table to identify away to get to for example, $15 an hour.",35,,
236,0.97,2935.899,2943.006,"Saying this to and everyone coming to the table of Priesthood and walking out of that table, everyone would support the outcome.",35,,
237,0.97,2943.006,2960.424,We need to make sure we have a process moving forward and not only allows for us to move forward with responding to the public health crisis of homelessness and housing and Covid-19 are also to the public health crisis of racism and unarmed black and Brown folks being killed.,35,,
238,0.97,2960.424,2969.199,That requires urgency and requires us to get to a table where people have the same shared outcome because we have to have a urgency getting to that process.,35,,
239,0.97,2969.199,2986.049,I look forward to having conversations that will center those with lived experiences and principles and making sure we are moving forward with urgency and let's remember that we don't have time to wait.,35,,
240,0.97,2986.049,3004.968,Every article I have heard was talking about more people losing their homes or jobs or gone without unemployment insurance or losing Childcare and more black and Brown folks losing their lives because of systems that have not yet been fixed in this entire country.,35,,
241,0.97,3004.968,3010.841,Let's lead we have done before and let's do it with urgency that is committed of us.,35,,
242,0.97,3010.841,3018.982,I look forward to additional conversations about the next steps and I appreciate all the work.,35,,
243,0.97,3018.982,3023.854,I know people have worked day and night for many months and a lot of work is still to be done in front of us.,35,,
244,0.97,3023.854,3028.759,"Thank you, are there any comments or questions on that report?",36,,
245,0.97,3028.759,3036.8,"Okay, hearing none, we will go ahead and go down the roll call line.",36,,
246,0.97,3036.8,3037.868,"Councilmember Pederson, you are next.",36,,
247,0.97,3037.868,3038.468,Good morning.,36,,

262,0.97,3202.365,3214.978,"Due to the large item, we are planning to schedule an additional special meeting and we will let you know when that is as soon as we decide and probably center 17th or 25.",37,,
263,0.97,3214.978,3217.18,We are working with the President's office on that.,37,,
264,0.97,3217.18,3251.514,"Just a heads up, there is--I will potentially be reintroducing an amendment that tied at the Land-Use committee and the amendment is about the landmarks and the Seattle Department of construction and STC I would like to have authority over landmark sites and I'm not in favor of that.",37,,
265,0.97,3251.514,3267.197,I may reduce the member today to give other Councilmembers a chance to decide on that in the committee and we will still circulate that before noon today just so you have it prior to the new deadline for amendments before the Council.,37,,
266,0.97,3267.197,3319.382,"You all probably noticed the harmful Wildfire smoke and return to our city today reducing air quality and we have an opportunity to take some legislative action on climate change later this week with resolution 31933 which I believe will be heard at the education committee this Friday at 2. the sponsor of this, what it is doing is updating the key environmental questions climate questions specifically about whether carbon emissions will be increased by legislation or mother the ability to adapt to climate change or resiliency to climate change will be increased or decreased by legislation so it puts a comment on legislation and that was an idea that came from Dr.",37,,
267,0.97,3319.382,3325.288,Kathy total that is a constituent of mine and ran a very strong campaign.,37,,
268,0.97,3325.288,3338.101,"Climate solutions which is a key environmental organization in the state, they said that Seattle must act with urgency to cut the pollution and excel the energy we need.",37,,
269,0.97,3338.101,3355.318,We must ensure that future policies the city ADOPTS cut climate pollution and adding climate considerations is a good first step to better understanding how city policies impact the climate and therefore our health and finances and safety.,37,,
270,0.97,3355.318,3360.223,That resolution is going to Committee this week.,37,,
271,0.97,3360.223,3363.626,That is all I have.,37,,
272,0.97,3363.626,3363.96,Thank you.,37,,
273,0.97,3363.96,3370.8,Thank you Councilmember Pederson for that report.,38,,
274,0.97,3370.8,3381.211,I do have a question about your potential amendment to Councilwoman 9835 with one of the legislative aides circling that to Councilmembers.,38,,
275,0.97,3381.211,3405.068,It would be helpful to me to hear from members of the committee and those that were in favor of it and against it and to hear the rationale for both of those perspectives during briefing.,38,,
276,0.97,3405.068,3414.677,"Sure, I'm happy to address those that are concerned about the amendment being proposed.",39,,
277,0.97,3414.677,3419.349,I can go first or last.,39,,
278,0.97,3419.349,3449.512,"Since you are potentially bringing forth the amendment again which my understanding would in reading it, it appears the amendment would remove language from Council bill 119835 that would authorize our Seattle Department of construction inspections for conditional use process to allow uses on landmark sites that are located in Single- family zones that would not otherwise be permitted.",40,,
279,0.97,3449.512,3504.467,If I understand the amendments and the base bill allows as CCI through the use of a permit to allow for uses at particular sites including those located within single-family zones that are currently not otherwise permitted and if I understand the permit that you are potentially introducing is that the amendment would require that the board continue to have authority for determining whether or not those conditional uses would be allowable as opposed to allowing STI to exercise discretion on those particular uses.,40,,
280,0.97,3504.467,3511.608,And my understanding your potential amendment appropriately?,40,,
281,0.97,3511.608,3511.975,Yes.,41,,
282,0.97,3511.975,3519.482,The current law is landmark and the board has that authority.,41,,
283,0.97,3519.482,3524.954,The Ministry she wants to take that authority and put it over to STC I which I'm not in favor of.,41,,
284,0.97,3524.954,3545.275,"Okay, when you say that, you mean the Council bill that is before the city council this afternoon reflects the Durkin demonstration and the desire to have that authority in the Sdci and not the board, correct?",42,,
285,0.97,3545.275,3546.676,Correct.,43,,
286,0.97,3546.676,3562.825,"I officially got additional clarity and I would like to hear from you, Councilmember Pederson, why you are considering bringing back this amendment that failed in committee?",44,,
287,0.97,3562.825,3563.526,Thank you.,45,,
288,0.97,3563.526,3573.102,"So, I don't think Sdci made a good case as to why they should take authority away from the board.",45,,
289,0.97,3573.102,3579.409,It is the existing law that they have this authority and they did not make it the case.,45,,
290,0.97,3579.409,3592.021,I think it favors real estate developers that may want to remove urban forest and put a new suburban type developments.,45,,
291,0.97,3592.021,3596.859,It's a big change and I think it warrants additional discussion.,45,,
292,0.97,3596.859,3646.809,"This bill was originally put forward as a chance to clean up Land-Use legislation and I think this particular change goes too far to be thrown on the bus bill and should come separately for more discussion hearing from the landmarks board and members, Sdci did say they talk to landmark staff but we didn't hear from the board and we have since learned that the board members are not aware of this change until it was put forward so just to pull out the proposal and give it more time if they want to pursue this, they can come back in a separate piece of legislation.",45,,
293,0.97,3646.809,3650.48,"Councilmember Strauss, did you have something you want to say?",46,,
294,0.97,3650.48,3655.785,I heard you request that you wanted us to have a discussion about the merits of this amended here and now.,47,,
295,0.97,3655.785,3658.621,Is not the case?,47,,
296,0.97,3658.621,3659.622,It is the case.,48,,
297,0.97,3659.622,3698.795,I think it would be helpful and I think this is an appropriate opportunity for us to have baseline conversation around an amendment that potentially might come back 2:00 that failed so I think it would be important for the rest of us that are not members to understand the proponent side as well as the opponent side to this potential amendment.,48,,
298,0.97,3698.795,3714.777,"In that spirit, I invite members of the Land-Use committee to provide those of us that are not standing members without additional information before we head into our 2:00 full council meeting.",48,,
299,0.97,3714.777,3721.984,Thank you and thank you Councilmember Pederson for alerting me that you bring this back.,49,,
300,0.97,3721.984,3750.313,"With our conversation taking place a minute before the briefing started, I did not have a chance to go back and review the last presentation where we had a robust discussion but what I can tell you is that most landmark structures are designated as sites as well with the change of use adds and sites with the understanding of buildings as well.",49,,
301,0.97,3750.313,3779.909,The concerns that I have been hearing over Email do not address the contents of the bill and I will need to go back and review the committee hearing to have a robust discussion because I learned about this just a minute before the briefing started so I will be able to speak more at length about this this afternoon.,49,,
302,0.97,3779.909,3781.511,Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Mosqueda.,50,,
303,0.97,3781.511,3783.346,Thank you.,51,,
304,0.97,3783.346,3798.561,"Councilmember Pederson, you mentioned that the landmark board had only recently learned of this proposal.",51,,
305,0.97,3798.561,3801.23,I'm wondering had they taken a position on the proposal since learning of it?,51,,
306,0.97,3801.23,3817.68,"Also, as it relates to the groups that work on then marking properties and the preservation of properties that have been landmarks, had we heard about this inclusion in the bill?",51,,
307,0.97,3817.68,3818.247,Thank you.,51,,
308,0.97,3818.247,3818.881,Thank you.,52,,
309,0.97,3818.881,3831.26,It's my understanding that because the landmark board had not heard about it in time that they were not able to add it to the agenda to make an official opinion as the landmarks board.,52,,
310,0.97,3831.26,3840.803,I don't know if they have heard from historic Seattle and that is a good question but I can search Emails for that.,52,,
311,0.97,3840.803,3856.419,August is sort of a sleepy time for a lot of people and they are away and it's another reason why we might want to pull this out and deal with that specific item later.,52,,
312,0.97,3856.419,3873.269,I understand the purpose of this bill which is usually considered cleanup with a bunch of different technical issues that might not necessarily meet the input or consideration of organizations.,53,,
313,0.97,3873.269,3916.579,"We have a board, a city created Stakeholder to this particular issue and I would like to hear from them on their position on inclusion of this and if there is not time to do so, I think it might be a basis for asking Sdci to bring this back separately in a way that would be a greater input.",53,,
314,0.97,3916.579,3917.647,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",54,,
315,0.97,3917.647,3922.184,"Thank you, Council President.",55,,
316,0.97,3922.184,3934.263,I appreciate the opportunity to speak about this.,55,,
317,0.97,3934.263,3937.9,I did speak against the at the last committee meeting and I will do so again now.,55,,
318,0.97,3937.9,3945.474,Let's also remember that this was almost 4 weeks ago that we have this discussion so there has been ample amount of time this past week prior going into Recess.,55,,
319,0.97,3945.474,3951.314,It was not included on the Monday agenda prior to Recess and now here we are potentially thinking about delaying again and I don't think that is a good idea.,55,,
320,0.97,3951.314,3955.584,Me give you a few examples of why I think this is not a necessary amendment.,55,,
321,0.97,3955.584,3976.305,The Department of neighborhood Stowaways and if there's a change to a landmark site and this is just allowing flexibility for the uses which is squarely within Sdci's world with the work that they currently do and they make determinations typical of the role and it could come up on a large site.,55,,
322,0.97,3976.305,3987.049,The reason I think this is an important use of flexibility is that there is the ability to potentially use those sites for housing and other things that are public assets and goods that we would want to include on various sites.,55,,
323,0.97,3987.049,4006.469,"If there is no flexibility on uses, a leave important opportunities to have housing on the table or other aspects that we would want to see moved and I think it is important to recognize that this is just a conditional use.",55,,
324,0.97,4006.469,4008.771,It is still a conditional use decision and not a Free-For- all.,55,,
325,0.97,4008.771,4042.671,The Department of neighborhoods ways in if there is a change and if they would be a suburban development and I'm not sure what that means but what we are talking about here is very much within the scope of what the Council and previous councils have wanted the flexibility to include public assets on sites that could include things like housing and it is not a Free- For-All.,55,,
326,0.97,4042.671,4046.976,This is a thoughtful and careful Site-Specific review and I think it is important to recognize that this is conditional use.,55,,
327,0.97,4046.976,4050.012,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda for that description on the opponent side.",56,,
328,0.97,4050.012,4062.825,I appreciate having an opportunity to spend a little bit of time hearing the proponent side and opponent side during the Council briefing.,56,,
329,0.97,4062.825,4077.54,Are there any other comments or questions on this particular potential amendment or any other portions of Councilmember Pederson's report?,56,,
330,0.97,4077.54,4083.546,I just I would give one example of it would be helpful.,57,,
331,0.97,4083.546,4084.447,"Absolutely, please.",58,,
332,0.97,4084.447,4116.245,Think about all the great work that we always applaud with historic buildings and we have done a lot of work to bring in folks with various mixed incomes into credible housing opportunities with transit and Childcare opportunities and having the ability to make sure there is flexibility on landmark or historic sites has allowed for us to act with urgency when there is ability to have housing.,59,,
333,0.97,4116.245,4129.325,I don't want us to Miss an opportunity like that I think this is a conditional review so there would still be the opportunity to weigh in so it's not Miss any opportunities.,59,,
334,0.97,4129.325,4137.8,Very helpful.,60,,
335,0.97,4137.8,4138.501,"Councilmember Pederson, please.",60,,
336,0.97,4138.501,4141.136,My district was Referenced and I just want to speak to that.,61,,
337,0.97,4141.136,4153.916,It was approved by the landmark board under existing law and there is a lack of Childcare and transit in the area so I just think that the way the law is now is working and this is a big change.,61,,
338,0.97,4153.916,4168.03,I would like to have the consideration to have that a different date.,61,,
339,0.97,4168.03,4169.098,"Councilmember Strauss, please.",62,,
340,0.97,4169.098,4217.379,"Most buildings that are Landmarked are inclusive of the site and the fact that the site was not included in the land use code was a mistake and because of the intent of the code section, these four landmarks to be used under certain conditions which require the process, the code never considered that they are not just structures but are included insights which is the technical nature of this change and finding as my colleagues have stated with the land use committee and there is a process for the decisions to be seen and heard and it is not an administrative change.",63,,
341,0.97,4217.379,4217.713,Thank you.,63,,
342,0.97,4217.713,4232.795,Are there any other comments or questions about this particular report?,64,,
343,0.97,4232.795,4245.608,"Okay, again, I appreciate the opportunity to have a conversation about this in Council briefing and in anticipation of Councilmember Pederson potentially bringing forward this amendment that failed during committee.",64,,
344,0.97,4245.608,4252.715,We look forward to hearing from you before 2:00 if you do intend to bring it forward.,64,,
345,0.97,4252.715,4265.027,It would be helpful to know that pilots 1:00 today to make sure that we move forward this afternoon.,64,,
346,0.97,4265.027,4272.835,I would appreciate that heads up if you are able to accommodate this request.,64,,
347,0.97,4272.835,4278.34,I am senior had not so I will take that as a commitment to let me know by 1 PM if you will bring that memo forward.,64,,
348,0.97,4278.34,4280.542,"Okay, let's go ahead and go down the roll call.",64,,
349,0.97,4280.542,4292.254,Next up is Councilmember Sawant and then we will hear from Councilmember Strauss.,64,,
350,0.97,4292.254,4292.588,Good morning.,64,,
351,0.97,4292.588,4295.224,I hope everyone had a Council good Recess.,65,,
352,0.97,4295.224,4315.678,"There are no items of the next meeting of the committee is two weeks from now Tuesday, September 22.",65,,
353,0.97,4315.678,4340.502,"In relation to the Mayor's veto of the summer budget vote, I wanted to clarify to several members of the public who have written to my office during the break to remind everyone that my office has always voted against the budget because every budget that I have encountered has been in other ways failing to meet the needs of ordinary people.",65,,
354,0.97,4340.502,4379.308,"We have made it very clear that we are fighting for the people's budget and as I always said, if politicians were willing to join me in pushing for a budget that actually fights for the needs of the poor and the working class and homeless and oppressed people to have significant expansions of other immediate needs of those currently homeless, we would be willing to work together with others on the Council and that commitment continues to the budget we will be working on this year.",65,,
355,0.97,4379.308,4385.714,"As I have always said, my loyalty and the loyalty of my office and staff is with the vast majority of people that are left behind year after year in the budget.",65,,
356,0.97,4385.714,4398.894,I wanted to clarify further that Mayor Durkin vetoed the bill because she is not happy with how little there was in the budget and wants to do greater.,65,,
357,0.97,4398.894,4447.776,She has proposed any cuts and even minor cuts to the police Department and opposed to minor public oversight on the police Department and her veto of the Council's budget is doubling down in the interest of big business and the entities and all those that are in a nice way to post any and all progressive policies by the Council of the last six years whether it was the minimum wage or recent history and facts and whether it was improvements in the tiny house which have proven themselves as a real temporary solution for homeless people or Renters rights like the payment plan.,65,,
358,0.97,4447.776,4473.035,It is also important to remember that each of every single aggressive policy past by the majority were unanimous vote in the Council of the last six years has happened because there have been movements of ordinary people and community members and Renters rights organizations and homeless activist themselves fighting around those demands.,65,,
359,0.97,4473.035,4536.298,"We should also remember that part of the doubling down for the interests of big business is also represented through defending the police Department in the egregious and violent approach which continues to this day, last night through live Video, we were able to see how the police Department reacted towards peaceful protesters with everyday March who are the activist or among the activists that have fought for Defunding the police and are among the reason the Council has shown willingness to do anything around accountability so it's very important that those of us that our elected representatives that are wanting to take a position other than what they have taken in solidarity and have had violence directed at them from the police.",65,,
360,0.97,4536.298,4551.313,This has been a pattern and it is very clear which sites she is on which is not on the side of ordinary people that are fighting for a better society.,65,,
361,0.97,4551.313,4593.655,She vetoed the budget and did not sign the crowd control weapons ban that was one of the most significant victories which was an ordinance that was fought for by my office and not only did she not sign it but she tried to get a judge to prevent the band being enforced and did not veto the text itself but returned the legislation unsigned and has in every way possible adamantly opposed any taxes on big business to make funds available for the urgent needs of the society including affordable housing.,65,,
362,0.97,4593.655,4629.157,"The veto she has enacted will not stop but it will turn them into executive decisions and for all those reasons, it is absolutely correct for the city Council to stand against the veto and while Socialist continue to believe the budget that was passed is not acceptable, it makes very minor changes and fails to fulfill the promise of Defunding the police by at least 50%.",65,,
363,0.97,4629.157,4632.394,"With affordable housing all the Pre-Existing needs of society but the veto makes everything worse, not better.",65,,
364,0.97,4632.394,4636.698,We have to be very clear about that.,65,,
365,0.97,4636.698,4640.302,"Last but not least, it's honest that the Mayor is unfamiliar with compromise.",65,,
366,0.97,4640.302,4682.944,What she is doing is moving to the right and fighting to exclusively represent big business which is a reminder that it is a call to action for ordinary people and working people that we need to double down in building organized resistance and United movements to win police accountability and affordable housing to make Seattle a city that is good for all and building a United movement means collaborating and reaching agreement on the things we agree on while we continue honest debate on things we don't agree on.,65,,
367,0.97,4682.944,4687.449,That is collaboration and fighting alongside the people impacted by the injustice and want to fight for a different kind of society.,65,,
368,0.97,4687.449,4691.119,I absolutely oppose the veto of the budget.,65,,
369,0.97,4691.119,4691.92,Thank you.,65,,
370,0.97,4691.92,4701.296,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",66,,
371,0.97,4701.296,4703.065,Are there any comments or questions on that report?,66,,
372,0.97,4703.065,4707.102,"Hearing on, we will go ahead in here now from Councilmember Strauss.",66,,
373,0.97,4707.102,4707.602,"Please, good morning.",66,,
374,0.97,4707.602,4710.372,Thank you Council president and good morning.,67,,
375,0.97,4710.372,4730.692,There is one item from the Land- use neighborhoods Committee on the introduction of the calendar which is Council the 19877 which would extend the Department of construction inspections and Department neighborhoods ability to host virtual design during the Trento emergency.,67,,
376,0.97,4730.692,4756.284,"This is an extension of the bill passed earlier this year and as an update, they have hired additional staff to host means virtually beginning the process which we discussed about and passed the bill earlier this year and there are still some requirements that are needed to have an extension of this process.",67,,
377,0.97,4756.284,4768.897,The Council bill is an extension of that virtual design review during the Trento emergency.,67,,
378,0.97,4768.897,4780.842,There are six items from that neighborhoods Committee on the full council agenda and five appointments to the Seattle design Commission and Councilwoman 9835 which is the annual Land-Use bill.,67,,
379,0.97,4780.842,4791.052,There is a substitute amendment which makes minor technical and clarifying amendments and can be found on today's agenda.,67,,
380,0.97,4791.052,4798.36,This is separate from Peterson's amendment which I will bring more information to you and our colleagues later this afternoon.,67,,
381,0.97,4798.36,4824.352,"The next meeting of the Land- use neighborhoods Committee is tomorrow, Wednesday, September 9 and there are five items on the agenda and a briefing a public hearing on Councilwoman 9838 which is the comprehensive plan amendments and a briefing and public hearing on the resolution that sets the docket for the comprehensive plan.",67,,
382,0.97,4824.352,4835.096,There is also a vote on Councilwoman 9827 which Rezoned land for affordable housing.,67,,
383,0.97,4835.096,4842.537,A briefing on Council bill 119877 which I just mentioned extends virtual design and landmarks.,67,,
384,0.97,4842.537,4855.016,There is also a required post adoption public hearing which the Council adopted in July to implement regulations for Floodplains as required by FEMA.,67,,
385,0.97,4855.016,4871.032,"As Councilmember Pederson mentioned, I took the lead sponsoring the Scooters legislation and while I still have some concerns, I think we need to move on this now.",67,,
386,0.97,4871.032,4922.45,"We have engaged in an academic conversation for 18 months or longer about how Scooters can work in Seattle and while I have many concerns about safety parking and equity and other issues, we are at a point where the conversations have gone on long enough and the pilot program is important to allow people to learn when it is not rainy and dark and give them a chance to have a safe manner and at that time, if we realize that Scooters are not well suited for our city, we can end the pilot and we do need to move forward at this time because as I have said, we are at the point where the conversation has gone on long enough and if we don't try this, we will continue to circle around the same questions I can only be answered if we try it in the real world.",67,,
387,0.97,4922.45,4938.9,"In district 6, I will be joining the monthly meeting and I did take time over Recess to speak with residents of district 6 about issues across our district and we will continue our district 6 meeting this week.",67,,

390,0.97,4972.634,4973.034,Thank you.,67,,
391,0.97,4973.034,4974.436,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss.",68,,
392,0.97,4974.436,4975.804,Any comments or questions on that report?,68,,
393,0.97,4975.804,4976.438,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",68,,
394,0.97,4976.438,4977.305,Thank you.,69,,
395,0.97,4977.305,5041.302,"Councilmember Strauss, I totally understand your desire to act on the Scooter permit legislation insufficient time to allow for people to learn to use Scooters while the weather is still nice and it is a legitimate reason that we move quickly and I'm requesting that we hold in just one week over the Recess and there was a new lawsuit in the Superior Court after the committee vote on behalf of people injured across the country regarding Scooters and how D.O.T.",69,,
396,0.97,5041.302,5053.715,Proposes within the share pilot requirements to address some of the issues that I know we share concerns about related to safety.,69,,
397,0.97,5053.715,5093.254,There is also--I just learned that there is a pending lawsuit for injuries to pedestrians and particularly elderly pedestrians for writing on sidewalks and I know there is a lot of good work around enforcement intentions around the use of Scooters on sidewalks and there is this issue of course of allowing Scooter use on trails where there is no sidewalk and that is another issue.,69,,
398,0.97,5093.254,5106.067,I would appreciate one more week and whether or not you are open to a one week delay.,69,,
399,0.97,5106.067,5168.63,"Councilmember Herbold, I would just say I appreciate you lifting up those particular legal cases that exist outside of the state of Washington and I would just say in my review of the legislation when we were discussing this at length and Committee is one of the things that was important and was highlighted in the legislation and this particular Council bill that we will be Consideing today which allows for the use to move forward and we are not legislating the permit use document which is a much longer document that has been negotiated and the companies who are going to provide the service will need to agree to in order to deploy devices in the city.",70,,
400,0.97,5168.63,5202.096,One of the things that was important that came out of that conversation is that we have the strongest indemnification clause of all of those we are aware of in the country and that is important because the indemnification clause is a protection to the taxpayers of the city of Seattle so it won't prevent groups like the ones you have just identified and discussed from suing the corporations directly.,70,,
401,0.97,5202.096,5246.841,The obligation on the city council is making sure that we are holding these corporations accountable to make sure that it is in the safest way possible for the safety of his many people as possible across the city and I also see a secondary obligation for us to make sure that in the deployment of these devices will we know there are some ongoing safety concerns that we will never be able to completely zero out that we have to make sure we protect the taxpayers of the city of Seattle from multimillion dollar lawsuits that could be filed against the city of Seattle directly.,70,,
402,0.97,5246.841,5252.313,I believe we have done it through the indemnification clause that was discussed and highlighted during the presentation by D.O.T.,70,,
403,0.97,5252.313,5280.508,And I fill comfortable moving forward with the legislation today and don't think that an additional week will improve on the realities of those indemnification issues that have been negotiated and worked on extensively between the executive D.O.T.,70,,
404,0.97,5280.508,5291.519,And potential participants in the program with others.,70,,
405,0.97,5291.519,5298.226,"Again, there is nothing we can do to guarantee that there won't be or that there will be zero injuries.",70,,
406,0.97,5298.226,5320.381,"In the event that there are some injuries that the corporation is responsible for, it's important to make sure the corporations will be responsible for those and I think based on my superficial understanding of these lawsuits that are happening other places that it is in fact what is underlying in those issues.",70,,
407,0.97,5320.381,5332.16,I just wanted to state my position on the record as it relates to the legal issues and I'm happy to clear or here that sponsor as well.,70,,
408,0.97,5332.16,5346.207,"For clarification, I appreciate the protection provided through the indemnification clause and sharing his strength.",71,,
409,0.97,5346.207,5404.332,"My concerns are really focused with full understanding that the legislation is only establishing a permit and not itself establishing the requirements but we have those requirements and in those requirements with separate from the legislation, reviewing them in light of these lawsuits that have been filed since the committee action to make sure that the permit requirements adequately address not zeroing out all accidents but mitigating to the best of our ability to my satisfaction, the likelihood of large numbers of injuries.",71,,
410,0.97,5404.332,5421.949,Not purely for protecting the city's pocketbook but for protecting folks who ride the Scooters and are able to ride the Scooters because the city has permitted them.,71,,
411,0.97,5421.949,5457.084,"I think the point that I was trying to also make, Councilmember Herbold is because the legislation before us today is only about setting the fees for those permits, there is nothing that Precludes us from a Council considering or continuing to engage with the Seattle Department of transportation as it relates to the permit requirements that again are not subject to this afternoon's legislative action by the Council and my understanding is they won't be.",72,,
412,0.97,5457.084,5469.697,We won't be seeing a bill that puts forward a need for the Council to approve the permit requirements.,72,,
413,0.97,5469.697,5484.979,"Setting aside the issue of the fees, I believe the work you are describing can and should continue through direct engagement with the Department of transportation on those particular subjective issues related to ongoing safety concerns by Councilmembers.",72,,
414,0.97,5484.979,5586.647,I will use myself as an example and intend to support the bill this afternoon and would support it moving forward this afternoon because it sets the fees but I have already had top engagement with issues of concern I had about the requirement document with a minimum of deployment units and racially diverse zip codes as well as issues related to parking Corrals that will help to promote parking infrastructure to make sure they are put into place that are safe and not obstructing the Right-Of-Way of other appropriate uses for sidewalks so I am using myself as an example of feeling comfortable through the conversation which is about the fees that we want charged in order to have this opportunity to deploy these and I still continue to engage with the requirements and I believe those things can happen on a parallel path without causing additional delay on the legislation that was voted out of committee before Recess.,72,,
415,0.97,5586.647,5597.325,Councilmember Strauss and then Councilmember Mosqueda.,72,,
416,0.97,5597.325,5600.061,"If you wants to go first, I can wrap up at the end.",73,,
417,0.97,5600.061,5600.861,Thank you very much.,74,,
418,0.97,5600.861,5610.104,I look forward to hearing what you have to say and I wanted to take a quick second to make sure I did not Miss an opportunity to continue to correct and educate the viewing public about Scooters.,74,,
419,0.97,5610.104,5619.981,There was a robust conversation and I'm really excited that this legislation is moving forward as a first step.,74,,
420,0.97,5619.981,5638.666,"As we engage in the conversation, the most important Takeaways I remember from the conversation was an analysis of the Austin study at the time that was looking at injuries and deaths related to Scooters and it is important to highlight the data.",74,,
421,0.97,5638.666,5658.786,"There may be people that file lawsuits on a number of items but for 913,000 trips that were done, there were 29 injuries which were also minor in relation to others and zero deaths.",74,,
422,0.97,5658.786,5678.706,I just think it is an important opportunity to continue to highlight that the type of Statistic is not the case of cars for example where people die on a daily basis with the type of injuries that we have seen and we don't stop all traffic in the city although there are some that would like us to.,74,,
423,0.97,5678.706,5704.465,We continue to try to make cards and roads safer places and I think making sure that more people can get out of their cars and into a mode of Transportation is not only going to be important for us to think about but the safety of our planet given that many of us cannot even breathe.,74,,
424,0.97,5704.465,5719.88,"This is an important step in recognizing that currently the Scooters according to the data that we found, zero deaths for 930,000 trips taken and minor injuries than other types of transportation.",74,,
425,0.97,5719.88,5744.638,"I look forward to putting on this legislation and I also will NOTE similar to the Council President, I assume this is a first step and I have a lot of questions but minor more specific to how to implement a requirements like the city of Chicago has used to make sure they are carriers and requiring employees instead of independent contractors.",74,,
426,0.97,5744.638,5757.918,There are a lot of aspects that I know will be under discussion moving forward and the public safety issue is something I wanted to offer my take an recollection of what the safety study showed us.,74,,
427,0.97,5757.918,5760.121,Thank you for that.,75,,
428,0.97,5760.121,5773.534,Councilmember Pederson and then we will hear from Councilmember Strauss if he wants to wrap up the debate unless Councilmember Herbold wants to add something.,75,,
429,0.97,5773.534,5773.934,Thank you.,76,,
430,0.97,5773.934,5780.641,I just wanted to end the concerns raised by Councilmember Herbold.,76,,
431,0.97,5780.641,5785.946,"When we had our Committee hearing on this, we did look at a letter we received from Dr.",76,,
432,0.97,5785.946,5799.126,Fred where he had cited six studies with concerns about injuries and with the city having the official policy and something to be mindful of.,76,,
433,0.97,5799.126,5814.975,One of my concerns with the legislation is there are two Council bills and what is the fees and what is the loosening of where the Scooters can go or clarifying of where they will be allowed.,76,,
434,0.97,5814.975,5873.934,"My concern is legislation lacks the specifics on pilot program and it is scant legislation and there is this permit requirement document which is helpful and thoughtful but that is not part of the legislation so that is one of my concerns that we are exceeding our authority on this and as the chair of the transportation committee since there will be this new mode of transportation introduced onto our streets and in some cases sidewalks when streets are not an option, I will send a letter to the director encouraging them to keep track of certain Metrics so that they can report back to us in six months and 12 months on how that is going with the pilot.",76,,
435,0.97,5873.934,5874.501,Thank you.,77,,
436,0.97,5874.501,5876.737,"Councilmember Herbold, did you have anything you wanted to add?",77,,
437,0.97,5876.737,5900.594,"Yeah, I hope this is received in the spirit it is offered but with collaboration, I'm disappointed that my request for a one week delay has turned into this are you for it or against it discussion.",78,,
438,0.97,5900.594,5907.968,It has long been the culture of this Council to observe that courtesy when a colleague requests a one week delay.,78,,
439,0.97,5907.968,5930.557,My request is not an indication that I'm opposing the legislation and I think there is a lot of good work that has been done on the legislation since we had begun speaking about it and as Councilmember Strauss as the intellectual exercise around that.,78,,
440,0.97,5930.557,5935.095,I just want to get to a place where I feel good about voting on this legislation.,78,,
441,0.97,5935.095,5955.316,"I'm almost there and again, I'm disappointed that what is a request for a courtesy delay is received in a way where we are now debating the merits of the bill and that was not my intent.",78,,
442,0.97,5955.316,5955.716,Thank you.,78,,
443,0.97,5955.716,5979.907,"I appreciate your remarks I think ultimately, Councilmember Strauss as the sponsor of the bill can tell us whether he is find with an additional one week delay and I hope you didn't take any of my comments as calling into question or Staking out a spectrum of for or against.",79,,
444,0.97,5979.907,6019.113,"I thought I was responding to your particular concern with whether or not the lawsuits and other jurisdictions trigger particular legal concerns as it relates to the legislation as proposed and in my estimation because of the indemnification clause, I feel as though the concerns you are expressing have been in my mind for me addressed adequately and I feel comfortable moving forward today without the need for an additional week.",79,,
445,0.97,6019.113,6041.268,I understand you have made requests for an additional week and have stated on the record your motivation for why you think another week would be necessary and so I am happy to handed over to Councilmember Strauss as a sponsor of the bill to hear from him his thoughts and see where we can go from here.,79,,
446,0.97,6041.268,6080.441,"Thank you for bringing these concerns and in the spirit of collaboration, Trevor gave me a call and even if it was just a minute before the briefing began about his amendment, hearing this request for a week delay on somewhat time sensitive legislation in my opinion and hearing for the first time that the briefing, it does not give me an opportunity to prepare or have a thoughtful conversation with you about the needs or the merits or desires you have.",80,,
447,0.97,6080.441,6106.266,I would be happy to have a conversation with you after the briefing but at this time I don't feel comfortable holding it for a week simply because the information that I have at this time is that the need to get this program running in good weather is one week at this time of the year with a great amount of impact.,80,,
448,0.97,6106.266,6132.86,The issues you did raise are important and the indemnification issues that have been well ironed out in this proposal and I also have a lot of concerns about this proposal.,80,,
449,0.97,6132.86,6153.213,I'm not that different from you in the fact that I have concerns and what has made me comfortable with passing the legislation today is D.O.T .'s pledge to me of being able to work through the permanent requirements and making changes as needed so that we have the greatest program possible.,80,,
450,0.97,6153.213,6176.537,"The example I provide from the Council committee and I'm not sure if it was before or after you have left for the meeting which was the first right on Scooters restricted to eight miles an hour which is a pace that some people, not myself, can run.",80,,
451,0.97,6176.537,6200.928,"It's quick but not that fast and one of the questions I raised is if people are having trouble learning to ride the Scooters, could we extend that requirement for an additional ride and they responded that this was something they could change in real time.",80,,
452,0.97,6200.928,6216.643,"I absolutely hear and understand your request for a week delay and if we were in June right now, I would have no problem at all saying yes and let's make sure this question is answered before we move forward.",80,,
453,0.97,6216.643,6231.458,My largest issue is that we have delayed this for 18 months or longer and the benefit of that delay has been one of the most robust programs in the country.,80,,
454,0.97,6231.458,6243.77,"In other cities moved quickly, there were technical glitches with Scooters and issues about sidewalk parking and D.O.T.",80,,
455,0.97,6243.77,6263.49,"Has done a good job of monitoring what other cities have done and creating a program that allows us to address these issues and similarly enough, providers and companies have been able to earn out wrinkles that they would have otherwise had and we moved on in this process.",80,,
456,0.97,6263.49,6287.447,"Because we already have the 18 month delay in because the weather is changing rapidly, I know it will be a seven this week but we only have a couple more weeks until the rain and darkness comes and we are already at sunset right now at 7:30 so I would be hesitant to delay this another week and with that, I will, conversation I briefing.",80,,
457,0.97,6287.447,6296.823,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss for closing a debate on the issue.",81,,
458,0.97,6296.823,6333.76,"Colleagues, I think given the request for an additional week to consider this legislation, I have taken the step of reaching out directly to the director to get additional information about any potential concerns with extensions of the pilot program and I have also asked them to please provide us with the response to the concerns regarding the implication or implementation if he is able to do so before 2:00 today.",81,,
459,0.97,6333.76,6354.514,I will wait to hear his response and I will stay in closed medication as it relates strictly to the procedural Úrequests for a One-Week extension with the policy issues for discussion in open session.,81,,
460,0.97,6354.514,6358.785,Thank you so much for that conversation.,81,,
461,0.97,6358.785,6369.129,I think we have a path forward in terms of what we will ultimately do with that legislation this afternoon.,81,,
462,0.97,6369.129,6376.036,Are there any other questions or comments on Councilmember Strauss's report?,81,,
463,0.97,6376.036,6399.96,"Hearing on, I will conclude Council briefing with my report at the city council meeting this afternoon, I will be moving to suspend the rules to allow for any limit to the introduction and referral calendar to refer position to a new collective bargaining agreement between the city of Seattle and local 79 at the International Association of aerospace workers.",81,,

466,0.97,6424.985,6451.578,He will join us at the top of today's agenda during the full Council to make a few remarks assuming that he is indeed reconfirmed and my committee has five appointments for the consideration so these five appointments are a mixture of Council with the promise of the oversight committee.,81,,
467,0.97,6451.578,6460.32,We will also consider one Mayoral appointment for the immigrant and refugee Commission all on this afternoon city council agenda.,81,,

470,0.97,6501.962,6511.671,I apologize for that but look forward to hosting members of the committee this Friday at 2:00 via zoom.,81,,

474,0.97,6527.754,6535.095,This is something that happened during our briefing so that is why I did not include in my report.,82,,
475,0.97,6535.095,6568.328,"Council President office, your Council has approved my walking on of the legislation I mentioned that we will be hearing in Committee on Friday and I knew we would hear the legislation but did not know it had not yet been referred so my staff has worked with yours to ensure that it is ready to be walked on at full council today and I wanted to make sure that everyone knew I would be walking in on that.",82,,
