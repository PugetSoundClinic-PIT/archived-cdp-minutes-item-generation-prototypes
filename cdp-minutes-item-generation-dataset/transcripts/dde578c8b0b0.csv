20,0.97,81.581,84.284,And-Has advised us that she must Recuse herself.,7,,
21,0.97,84.284,95.462,"Because this counsel bill inherently is, represents a financial interest for her, given the subject matter of that.",7,,
22,0.97,95.462,105.271,"So, wanted to make sure that the record is clear that Councilmember Sawant has Recused herself and is not in attendance at today's special full council meeting.",7,,

32,0.97,155.788,161.494,Is there a second?,9,,
33,0.97,161.494,161.895,Second.,10,,
34,0.97,161.895,164.998,It has been moved and Seconded to pass the bill.,11,,
35,0.97,164.998,173.606,"Colleagues, this legislation does not have, nor does it require a sponsor.",11,,
36,0.97,173.606,176.576,"However, our counsel rules require that a Councilmember speak about the legislation.",11,,
37,0.97,176.576,181.714,"As a result, I will address this legislation as a Council President.",11,,
38,0.97,181.714,189.722,Counsel bill 119891 relates to the legal representation of Councilmember Kshama Sawant.,11,,
39,0.97,189.722,214.647,"This ordinance is approved, the city of Seattle will cover the cost of the legal defense in judicial proceedings related to the sufficiency of a recall charge filed against Councilmember Sawant are soon to Rcw 29.82.023. I want to be clear that our consideration of this counsel bill is not a statement on or vote upon the merits of the recall petition.",11,,
40,0.97,214.647,227.393,"Issues related to the sufficiency of the recall charge of the merits of that effort is for the courts to do charge, not for the city council.",11,,
41,0.97,227.393,233.8,"Additionally, consideration of this counsel bill is not an endorsement or rejection of any initiatives related to the recall campaigns.",11,,
42,0.97,233.8,244.344,"The issues related to any and all recall campaigns regarding any Seattle-based elected official or issues related to a political process that are beyond the scope of today's legislation, and unrelated to our city council business.",11,,
43,0.97,244.344,250.45,Counsel bill 119891 is based on state statute.,11,,
44,0.97,250.45,261.261,"Specifically, Rcw 4.9 6.041 subsection 3 provides the city council with the framework by which to consider this issue.",11,,
45,0.97,261.261,265.098,"To begin with, I have consulted with the city attorney's office to inform my understanding of the state statute.",11,,
46,0.97,265.098,292.125,"The request for legal defense, and the procedural and legislative requirements that are necessary for any elected to take advantage of the various indemnification provisions outlined in Rcw 4.9 6.041. there have been comments by media and members of the public that the council must first conclude the Councilmember Sawant was acting within her official duties in order to avail herself of the requested legal defense.",11,,
47,0.97,292.125,301.434,Our city attorney's office has advised that this is not the case for subsection 3 of Rcw 4.9 6.041.,11,,
48,0.97,301.434,323.356,"While there are other indemnification provisions in Rcw 4.9404 41 that do have, acting within official duties requirement and determination, subsection 3 does not have that requirement.",11,,
49,0.97,323.356,328.161,"For the record, I think it is important that I now take a moment to read the full Rcw subsection 3 into the record.",11,,
50,0.97,328.161,364.397,"Which reads as follows: ""subsection 3. the necessary expenses of defending an elective officer of the local governmental entity in a judicial hearing to determine the sufficiency of a recall charge, as provided in Rcw 29.8 2.023 shall be paid, shall be paid by the local governmental entity if the officer requests such defense, and approval is granted by both the legislative authority of the local governmental entity, and the Attorney representing the local governmental entity.",11,,
51,0.97,364.397,382.915,"The expense is paid by the local governmental entity may include costs associated with an appeal of the decision rendered by the Superior Court concerning the sufficiency of the recall charge.""",11,,
52,0.97,384.984,396.295,"This legislation represents Councilmember Sawant's formal request that the city Council, as the local governmental entity, authorize the city attorney's office to provide her with legal defense regarding the judicial proceedings related to the sufficiency of the recall charge that has been filed against Councilmember Sawant.",12,,
53,0.97,396.295,406.906,"The city attorney's office has represented to me that the city attorney, Pete Holmes, is willing and able to provide the requested legal defense.",12,,
54,0.97,406.906,424.724,"In other words, it is my understanding that that second element that the Attorney representing the local governmental entity has also approved providing the defense requested by Councilmember Sawant should it be approved by the city council.",12,,
55,0.97,424.724,427.76,This would satisfy that second statutory requirement.,12,,
56,0.97,427.76,434.834,"So, colleagues, that is the basis of this particular legislation.",13,,
57,0.97,434.834,448.915,"And, this is a legislation that is before us now, and I am happy to open it up for any comments or questions or additional debate.",13,,
58,0.97,448.915,453.352,"So, are there any additional comments on the bill?",13,,
59,0.97,453.352,453.82,Councilmember Lewis?,13,,
60,0.97,453.82,460.693,Thank you Madam president for that summary.,14,,
61,0.97,460.693,471.204,"I do want to briefly address this, just because my office has received a considerable amount of communications from folks on one side or the other of this.",14,,
62,0.97,471.204,475.174,And I do think it is unfortunate that something that should be very pro forma like this is being politicized.,14,,
63,0.97,475.174,481.614,"So, I just wanted to address for a moment and say that at the top, I will be voting yes.",14,,
64,0.97,481.614,485.218,And I want to be clear that I am voting yes.,14,,
65,0.97,485.218,487.92,"And in doing so, not Commenting on the merits of the recall allegations.",14,,
66,0.97,487.92,506.339,"I am voting to uphold the values of our democracy here in Seattle and the principal that we, and the Mayor and the city attorney, the duly elected charter officers of the city, have representation if we are facing recall efforts, having been duly elected.",14,,
67,0.97,506.339,517.583,And the Foundational principle of this is that we have a process for picking our elected representative.,14,,
68,0.97,517.583,518.251,It is not recalls.,14,,
69,0.97,518.251,519.018,It is through elections.,14,,
70,0.97,519.018,523.656,"And if you don't like what your representative is doing, you can opt to not vote for them in the next election.",14,,
71,0.97,523.656,524.757,We just had a massive election.,14,,
72,0.97,524.757,529.729,All of these issues were Litigated.,14,,
73,0.97,529.729,532.431,And recall elections in Washington state a very narrow grounds and are extremely rare.,14,,
74,0.97,532.431,546.245,"And a legal process is required, as we just discussed through the Rcw's, to make sure that the purported grounds for a recall meet the very high constitutional requirements to overturn the will of the voters.",14,,
75,0.97,546.245,553.185,"Overturning the will of voters is an extremely serious, serious business.",14,,
76,0.97,553.185,557.123,And this requires that all of the parties be represented adequately by counsel in these proceedings.,14,,
77,0.97,557.123,563.696,"And tradition is, in Seattle, that the city council is represented by the city attorney's office in these proceedings.",14,,
78,0.97,563.696,573.205,"In 2011, just as cited, there was a recall petition filed against Councilmember Richard Conlon.",14,,
79,0.97,573.205,576.409,The council voted to allow the city attorney's office to represent Councilmember Conlon in those proceedings.,14,,
80,0.97,576.409,578.511,"I would say also, too.",14,,
81,0.97,578.511,603.436,"If Mayor Durkin came down to the Council to seek similar support for the ongoing pending recall effort against Mayor Durkin, I would enthusiastically support as well authorizing funds for the Mayor to be supported, because she was elected, like all of us were elected.",14,,
82,0.97,603.436,605.137,And this practice has to be applied uniformly.,14,,
83,0.97,605.137,609.475,This is not about endorsing anybody's decisions or speculating on the merits of any legal allegations.,14,,
84,0.97,609.475,611.844,This is about respecting the process and maintaining an important precedent.,14,,
85,0.97,611.844,620.419,And it is a slippery slope if we start picking and choosing who does or does not receive these kinds of legal representations.,14,,
86,0.97,620.419,625.558,"And no matter how it is sliced, to deny that legal representation would be to make arbitrary something that should be objective.",14,,
87,0.97,625.558,634.166,"And I did this applies to everybody, or going forward, it is going to apply to nobody.",14,,
88,0.97,634.166,635.568,"So, I will be voting yes.",14,,
89,0.97,635.568,636.635,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",15,,
90,0.97,636.635,637.069,For those remarks.,15,,
91,0.97,637.069,639.205,I wholeheartedly agree with those comments.,15,,
92,0.97,639.205,642.975,"Colleagues, are there any other comments.",15,,
93,0.97,642.975,643.609,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",15,,
94,0.97,643.609,644.076,Thank you.,16,,
95,0.97,644.076,651.984,I just want to add to the record as it relates to our vote on this issue.,16,,
96,0.97,651.984,678.677,"It is clear that Rcw 4904 13 gives very little direction upon which to base the decision to fund a recall defense beyond, again, as Council President Gonzales has explained, the requirement that the elected estimate the request and the city attorney has to agree to provide the defense.",16,,
97,0.97,678.677,681.113,Both of these things have occurred and it is left us.,16,,
98,0.97,681.113,696.095,"We do know, that making a determination, whether or not the subject individual is acting within the scope of duties is not a requirement.",16,,
99,0.97,696.095,705.171,"So, like Councilmember Lewis reference, I think looking back on the city's precedents, the principles upon these precedents, is it really important.",16,,
100,0.97,705.171,718.451,"This counsel has established a resident of providing funding for recall defense prior, as was stated, with prior Councilmember Richard Conlon.",16,,
101,0.97,718.451,748.981,"Another important principle, I would just like to add, which you know, I definitely related to the principle expressed by Councilmember Lewis, is that we want to make sure that future Councilmembers, people who are considering running for city Council, no that this is the standard of this counsel to provide funding for defense, as a really important equity principal.",16,,
102,0.97,748.981,772.905,"So, that those folks who are considering running for public office to our city council without a lot of financial, personal resources, are not chilled from making that decision to run for public office based on a decision that the Council will not defend them if there is a recall effort mounted against them.",16,,
103,0.97,772.905,794.827,"I think that, if we were to make a decision to not fund the defense for this recall, it would have a negative impact on our goals as the city to make sure that folks are running for political office from a diversity of backgrounds.",16,,
104,0.97,794.827,797.496,"So, that is why I will be voting in support of this measure.",16,,
105,0.97,797.496,797.797,Thank you.,16,,
106,0.97,797.797,799.532,Thank you member Herbold.,17,,
107,0.97,799.532,807.64,Councilmember him Mariah Ellis and other Councilmmbers,17,,
108,0.97,807.64,811.944,"I can after Councilmember Morales, president . Thank you.",18,,
109,0.97,811.944,819.118,"Thank you Councilmember Juarez, I will call on you after Councilmember Morales.",19,,
110,0.97,819.118,819.618,Councilmember Morales.,19,,
111,0.97,819.618,825.291,I will be prepared I want to say it is clear that elected officials receive legal defense.,20,,
112,0.97,825.291,831.864,I think any of us if we were faced with a similar situation and is Councilmember Herbold just said previous Councilmembers have been in similar situations.,20,,
113,0.97,831.864,837.469,We want to make sure that our city attorneys are to provide legal counsel.,20,,
114,0.97,837.469,841.373,And that it is afforded to other Councilmembers.,20,,
115,0.97,841.373,846.445,I think especially in this time.,20,,
116,0.97,846.445,854.386,"We need to protect our democracy and ensure that legal protections are afforded to our elected officials, are respected and I will be supporting this bill.",20,,
117,0.97,854.386,861.293,"Thank you member, thank you Councilmember Morales.",21,,
118,0.97,861.293,861.927,Councilmember whereas.,21,,
119,0.97,861.927,863.095,Thank you for your overview.,22,,
120,0.97,863.095,865.698,My concern is this.,22,,
121,0.97,865.698,868.0,"Looking at, you sent us an Email yesterday.",22,,
122,0.97,868.0,874.707,At about 4:00 regarding the statute that you cited earlier.,22,,
123,0.97,874.707,878.777,Rcw 4.960 41.,22,,
124,0.97,878.777,889.922,"And you put in quotation section 3. so, I would ask my colleagues to look at that, because there are four sections to section 49601.",22,,
125,0.97,889.922,900.099,"Before you can get to 3, which talks about the criteria and what is necessary, approval of the city council.",22,,
126,0.97,900.099,909.008,"Sections 1 a 2, particularly 2, state the legislative authority is a local governing entity.",22,,
127,0.97,909.008,917.716,"Past the fund that the acts, omissions of the officer are in good faith purported to be within the scope of his or her official duty.",22,,
128,0.97,917.716,923.222,The request shall be granted.,22,,
129,0.97,923.222,925.724,I tend to disagree with a few of my colleagues here.,22,,
130,0.97,925.724,927.059,I think the law is very clear.,22,,
131,0.97,927.059,947.546,"About what the steps are before we get to 3, before we highlighted the word shall, I thought today's discussion was whether or not, not determining the merits or the underlying elected back to the petition that were filed.",22,,
132,0.97,947.546,963.395,"I believe there were 8 and 2, they removed them so they are down to 6. but the question and the discussion today was not deciding whether or not these Act were in good faith, but having a discussion about deciding whether or not these acts were within the official scope of Councilmember Sawant's official duties.",22,,
133,0.97,963.395,968.3,"If so, then we approve the cost of defense.",22,,
134,0.97,968.3,970.769,"If not, we don't.",22,,
135,0.97,970.769,980.646,"So, just doesn't go to breaking down democracy or a slippery slope and all of the stuff about loading.",22,,
136,0.97,980.646,985.384,"If that were all true, we would not have an Rcw 496041 four recall for that very reason.",22,,
137,0.97,985.384,1007.106,"So, I can prepared, looking it up and looking at the law, besides a section that you cited Council president in your Email to us yesterday, all four pieces of it, sections of it, about whether or not Councilmember Sawant was acting within the scope of her official duties.",22,,
138,0.97,1007.106,1013.212,And whether or not we would be paying for that defense.,22,,
139,0.97,1013.212,1014.847,"Which either way, I am okay with that.",22,,
140,0.97,1014.847,1038.17,"But I don't agree with that this is just pro forma, and that we, as a city attorney said, they are willing and able, before we get to that, counsel has to make a decision to approve, and approval is contingent on the question about whether or not counselor Sawant was acting within the scope of her official duties.",22,,
141,0.97,1038.17,1044.343,"So, what I am hearing you say is that legal counsel, city attorney is now saying we are not going to have that, we don't have to have a discussion.",22,,
142,0.97,1044.343,1050.382,"That we just go to section 3 and we shall just, shall approve the cost.",22,,
143,0.97,1050.382,1056.088,"So, maybe I am reading this wrong, if I could get a little more clarification, I did not have a discussion with the city attorney's office Council President.",22,,
144,0.97,1056.088,1059.091,I know that you did.,22,,
145,0.97,1059.091,1068.2,"So, I know that we did, some of us did look at the petition that was filed September 1. I know that we're not looking at the underlying facts, allegations with the merit.",22,,
146,0.97,1068.2,1072.504,The judge will make that determination.,22,,
147,0.97,1072.504,1076.975,About whether to certify the recall petition.,22,,
148,0.97,1076.975,1083.949,"I thought our job here today was to discuss whether or not, again, these Act were within the scope of her official duties.",22,,
149,0.97,1083.949,1085.484,"And again, if so, then we approve it.",22,,
150,0.97,1085.484,1091.19,"This is not the same as what happened with Councilmember, I can't remember his name.",22,,
151,0.97,1091.19,1095.494,"You to set It., and.",22,,
152,0.97,1095.494,1096.962,Think this is a little bit different.,22,,
153,0.97,1096.962,1101.033,If you all look at the petition.,22,,
154,0.97,1101.033,1102.201,You don't have to agree with it.,22,,
155,0.97,1102.201,1103.335,Those are just a legend.,22,,
156,0.97,1103.335,1105.204,"But in its totality, that's why we have this law.",22,,
157,0.97,1105.204,1115.948,"It's for this discussion, and I am guessing, if I could hear more from you, Councilmember present, president of my colleagues, please correct me if I'm wrong, were not going to have a discussion about that.",22,,
158,0.97,1115.948,1117.349,Would like to hear that . 's,22,,
159,0.97,1117.349,1118.717,Thank you Councilmember whereas.,23,,
160,0.97,1118.717,1124.79,I want to say a couple of things in response to your comments.,23,,
161,0.97,1124.79,1132.197,One is that I think you have made an insinuation that I have Cherry picked sections of the law to put in front of the Council.,23,,
162,0.97,1132.197,1134.633,And I just want to say that that is not the case.,23,,
163,0.97,1134.633,1144.243,I have not done That.-I have provided the city council members with the link to the full law.,23,,
164,0.97,1144.243,1172.938,"And the reason that I have focused on and Referenced, as I mentioned in my Email, the relevant part of the statute is subsection 3. in my conversations with the law Department and in legal advice that I have received from them, that is the only section that applies to this particular set of circumstances.",23,,
165,0.97,1172.938,1177.576,"So, I can appreciate that you as a lawyer disagree with our lawyers.",23,,
166,0.97,1177.576,1188.12,"But Unfortunately, I am not the city's lawyers and I have two you know, acknowledge that the city attorney's office plays that role.",23,,
167,0.97,1188.12,1197.996,And their legal advice to us is that subsection 3 is the only relevant section to this particular set of circumstances.,23,,
168,0.97,1197.996,1203.335,"Because, we start with a question of, what is the indemnification needed for?",23,,
169,0.97,1203.335,1214.713,"And the answer to that response, to that question is, Miss indemnification is in response to a recall charge.",23,,
170,0.97,1214.713,1232.497,"The other three sections that you have noted exist in 4.9 6.041, are related to issues that may be requiring legal defense, but legal defense wholly unrelated to a recall charge.",23,,
171,0.97,1232.497,1237.135,"And of those instances, my understanding is, in some cases, legislation is not even required.",23,,
172,0.97,1237.135,1239.471,It just occurs.,23,,
173,0.97,1239.471,1246.578,Not requiring us to take any sort of legislative requirement or consider any kind of a bill.,23,,
174,0.97,1246.578,1301.7,"So, again, I feel that the legal advice that we have received, that my office has received from city attorney's office has been consistent and has been clear, that the only subsection of the relevant statute that applies under this set of circumstances because it is related to a recall charge is subsection 3. therefore, dispensing with the need, or you know, frankly, not triggering the requirement to have a conversation about whether or not the recall petition is rooted on the threshold question of whether the individual was act being in good faith purporting to perform her official duties as an employee.",23,,
175,0.97,1301.7,1306.538,"So, you know, this is part of the reason why I encourage folks to reach out directly to the law Department yesterday.",23,,
176,0.97,1306.538,1319.951,"But, I will, you know, for purposes of establishing the record here, it has been crystal clear to me that the only section of 496 that applies is subsection 3. not subsection 1. not subsection 2.",23,,
177,0.97,1319.951,1348.28,"Not subsection 4. and therefore, we go by the language that exists just in subsection 3, which does not have a requirement that the city council engage in a conversation around whether or not there was performance in good faith of official duties prior to making the determination of whether a legal defense should be provided by the city attorney's office.",23,,
178,0.97,1348.28,1351.783,If I may respond?,24,,
179,0.97,1351.783,1358.256,Council President.,25,,
180,0.97,1358.256,1358.557,Thank you.,25,,
181,0.97,1358.557,1360.225,"First of all, I want to apologize.",25,,
182,0.97,1360.225,1362.194,I did not mean to Impugn that you are Cherry picking.,25,,
183,0.97,1362.194,1370.102,But I was looking at is when I just saw section 3 I thought there was more to this in section 3 so I apologize for that.,25,,
184,0.97,1370.102,1376.875,"Second of all, I am not stating that his loss as we have to engage in a discussion about good faith.",25,,
185,0.97,1376.875,1377.209,It doesn't.,25,,
186,0.97,1377.209,1381.413,"What they are asking, what has to be decided is whether or not there within the scope official, official duties.",25,,
187,0.97,1381.413,1393.024,"Not the good faith that is just deciding, if we are deciding whether her act's were, or in good faith purported to be.",25,,
188,0.97,1393.024,1394.126,We are not deciding that.,25,,
189,0.97,1394.126,1400.799,"What I am getting at, what I read it as, if we would be deciding whether the acts were within the scope of official duty.",25,,
190,0.97,1400.799,1401.7,Not talking about good faith.,25,,
191,0.97,1401.7,1402.601,That is a clarification there.,25,,
192,0.97,1402.601,1405.437,"So, just so I am clear than.",25,,
193,0.97,1405.437,1419.851,"Legal has shared with you and you have shared with us and I don't doubt your word, that in regards to the Rcw 4.96041, that sections 1 a 2 don't apply and certainly not 4, when you read it.",25,,
194,0.97,1419.851,1426.124,"Just section 3. so, that is what you are sharing with us today from the city attorney's office, correct?",25,,
195,0.97,1426.124,1428.16,That is correct.,26,,
196,0.97,1428.16,1440.539,"So, we received pretty clear communication from the city attorney's office that that is in fact, in fact the case.",26,,
197,0.97,1440.539,1466.164,"So, there is a specific question that was posed to the law Department from one of our colleagues about whether or not there was a record requirement that we as a Council find that the activities are within the scope of the official duties prior to, I.E.",26,,
198,0.97,1466.164,1478.31,"As indicated in subsection 1 in subsection 2, prior to making this determination of whether or not Councilmember Sawant would be entitled to legal defense.",26,,
199,0.97,1478.31,1500.632,"The city attorney's office responded that recall defense costs ""recall defense costs are governed under Rcw 4.9 6.041 subsection 3. in contrast to other Indemnifications governed under sections 1 and 2. and Seattle municipal code 4.64.",26,,
200,0.97,1500.632,1506.538,Okay.,27,,
201,0.97,1506.538,1507.806,"And if I may, I'm sorry.",27,,
202,0.97,1507.806,1509.207,If I may respond Council President?,27,,
203,0.97,1509.207,1509.608,Sure.,28,,
204,0.97,1509.608,1509.875,Okay.,29,,
205,0.97,1509.875,1511.81,"So, again, I just want to be clear here.",29,,
206,0.97,1511.81,1513.111,We have said this many times.,29,,
207,0.97,1513.111,1516.748,We all got copies Of-I recited what was filed.,29,,
208,0.97,1516.748,1517.215,In Superior Court.,29,,
209,0.97,1517.215,1520.552,We are not arguing the merits of that as you correctly stated.,29,,
210,0.97,1520.552,1536.434,"I think where I am at, again, and I stand by that believe that I thought that our discussion to day based on a Provable meant the discussion about whether or not these Act were within the scope of official duties.",29,,
211,0.97,1536.434,1538.27,"So, that being said, maybe we can agree to disagree.",29,,
212,0.97,1538.27,1540.538,But I want to add this more on a personal note.,29,,
213,0.97,1540.538,1542.574,We have been on counsel for a few years now.,29,,
214,0.97,1542.574,1548.88,"And I never take what some of my colleagues do when they stand up and have a position, I don't take it personally.",29,,
215,0.97,1548.88,1556.955,We can't have these kind of jobs where we get hurt personally if people don't agree with us.,29,,
216,0.97,1556.955,1557.689,We agree to disagree.,29,,
217,0.97,1557.689,1558.79,We have our moments of course.,29,,
218,0.97,1558.79,1561.459,But I always have respect.,29,,
219,0.97,1561.459,1563.895,And I certainly understand the election process and why we have it.,29,,
220,0.97,1563.895,1566.097,And when the people speak.,29,,
221,0.97,1566.097,1573.405,"And this petition and this thing, what happened on its own merits and county Superior Court where it belongs.",29,,
222,0.97,1573.405,1582.514,"So, with that, I Unfortunately well not be not the voting yesterday.",29,,
223,0.97,1582.514,1583.014,Thank you.,29,,
224,0.97,1583.014,1583.882,Thank you Councilmember Warez.,30,,
225,0.97,1583.882,1586.785,"Úagain, I just want to, because I don't want to muddy the waters here.",30,,
226,0.97,1586.785,1590.322,For members of the public who are watching this.,30,,
227,0.97,1590.322,1607.138,"Because you have introduced the concept, in my opinion, incorrectly about the need for the Council to engage in a conversation about whether or not Councilmember Sawant was engaged in official duties.",30,,
228,0.97,1607.138,1613.511,As alleged or connected to the recall petition.,30,,
229,0.97,1613.511,1649.714,"And I am stating very clearly for the record, that based on the analysis, evaluation and legal advice of a city attorney's office, that is categorically not one of the things that the Council should or must consider in order to provide the authorization for the city attorney's office to give Councilmember Sawant legal defense as she would be entitled to under the various indemnification clauses.",30,,
230,0.97,1649.714,1661.393,"So, I just, I want to be really clear with the public, that to the extent that there is an insinuation that we are skipping a step, I want to say really clearly, that we are not skipping any steps.",30,,
231,0.97,1661.393,1665.263,We are bound I state law.,30,,
232,0.97,1665.263,1674.072,"And state law is limited to Rcw 496, I am forgetting the number now.",30,,
233,0.97,1674.072,1694.325,"496.041 subsection 3, in isolation and to the exclusion of subsection 1 and subsection 2. and, that is the rubric by which we are required to analyze the bill that is before us.",30,,
234,0.97,1694.325,1713.344,"Now, setting that aside, Councilmembers of course, are completely within the right to vote any way that they wish on this counsel bill, whether that is a Yes or no.",30,,
235,0.97,1713.344,1717.248,"And I appreciate you indicating clearly for the record, that you intend to vote no on this particular counsel bill.",30,,
236,0.97,1717.248,1733.531,"And again, Council President, I just want to state again for the record, I am not insinuating that you are skipping a step.",31,,
237,0.97,1733.531,1735.867,I think we just have to agree to disagree on this.,31,,
238,0.97,1735.867,1736.367,That's all.,31,,
239,0.97,1736.367,1738.369,"I am not insinuating any ill will, Mal intent on anybody.",31,,
240,0.97,1738.369,1738.737,Trust me.,31,,
241,0.97,1738.737,1739.07,Yeah.,31,,
242,0.97,1739.07,1752.584,"Councilmember Juarez, I am not saying you are proceeding Ith malice or Mal I but I think that you have clearly stated on the record that you believe that we must engage in a determination at the city council about whether or not Councilmember Sawant engaged in official duties before we get to subsection 3.",32,,
243,0.97,1752.584,1762.894,"And I am saying that that is, for purposes of the viewing public, that is not the case.",32,,
244,0.97,1762.894,1793.491,"So, I do not want to create an opportunity for people who have very strong political feelings about the unrelated recall petition to further sort of fuel the fires there, in terms of people's positions based on the process and the step send the requirements that we have before us.",32,,
245,0.97,1793.491,1804.202,I think it's important for us to be really clear that that does not include an evaluation of whether or not Councilmember Swant was engaged in official duties.,32,,
246,0.97,1804.202,1806.204,Colleagues.,33,,
247,0.97,1806.204,1814.112,Any other comments on the bill?,33,,
248,0.97,1814.112,1814.612,Councilmember Pedersen?,33,,
249,0.97,1814.612,1820.652,Thank you Council President.,34,,
250,0.97,1820.652,1826.024,I want to thank my constituents who took the time to contact me in my office with their very strong feelings about this issue.,34,,
251,0.97,1826.024,1827.125,Both for and against it.,34,,
252,0.97,1827.125,1831.829,Since it was reported widely in the media over the past month.,34,,
253,0.97,1831.829,1839.871,And I would like to offer 3 reasons for the vote I am about to take.,34,,
254,0.97,1839.871,1840.205,Number one.,34,,
255,0.97,1840.205,1848.413,"I passionately disagree with many actions and positions of Councilmember Sawant . and she certainly disagrees with me, too.",34,,
256,0.97,1848.413,1855.854,"Yet, the decision and the specifics of law before us today are not about disagreements over politics or personality.",34,,
257,0.97,1855.854,1879.911,"During these tumultuous times of public health Pandemics, economic recession, when our president and Washington Cheapens our democracy by Demonizing his opponents with personal attacks on the character, we here in Seattle can do a better job respecting our differences, finding common ground, staying focused on what we were elected to do.",34,,
258,0.97,1879.911,1890.622,"So, today's decision is not about personalities or politics, but about the provisions of the state government laws, and the relevant provisions of the revised code of Washington, saying that the elected official has to make the request for assistance, which she did.",34,,
259,0.97,1890.622,1899.03,"The city attorney has to approve it, which he did approve it.",34,,
260,0.97,1899.03,1900.632,And the city Council has to vote on it.,34,,
261,0.97,1900.632,1902.133,That is why we are here today.,34,,
262,0.97,1902.133,1905.536,"So, in deciding the most prudent path, I would normally consult a city attorney for advice.",34,,
263,0.97,1905.536,1908.206,"And in this rare case, the city attorney has already indicated his approval.",34,,
264,0.97,1908.206,1909.607,Our elected city attorney has approved this.,34,,
265,0.97,1909.607,1921.519,And he supports having us pay for the legal assistance and to have his office provided legal representation going forward.,34,,
266,0.97,1921.519,1922.253,Number two.,34,,
267,0.97,1922.253,1924.522,"While the situation is unfortunate and unusual, it is not unprecedented.",34,,
268,0.97,1924.522,1932.53,"In fact, there is a very compelling precedent mentioned by my colleagues earlier.",34,,
269,0.97,1932.53,1947.779,"2011, just one year before he joined the city council as a bright-eyed legislative aide, the Seattle city council unanimously approved nearly identical legislation to do and Councilmember Richard Conlon against the Recomposition- petition.",34,,
270,0.97,1947.779,1954.485,"Councilmember Conlon was accused of taking unauthorized government actions, which included signing important documents, etc.",34,,
271,0.97,1954.485,1955.353,"Ultimately, he was cleared.",34,,
272,0.97,1955.353,1958.423,"And Ironically, he later lost his reelection narrowly to Councilmember Sawant.",34,,
273,0.97,1958.423,1963.661,Councilmember Sawant was reelected less than a year ago.,34,,
274,0.97,1963.661,1975.973,"And finally, number three, the laws governing the recall of elected officials in Washington state as we discussed are complex.",34,,
275,0.97,1975.973,1977.675,The facts of this case are not Crystal-Clear.,34,,
276,0.97,1977.675,1993.591,"Suck all the more reason having adequate legal counsel should be available to a duly elected official defending against the recall petition, whether or not they can afford such legal assistance.",34,,
277,0.97,1993.591,1996.361,"A right to an attorney in your defense, whether or not you can afford it.",34,,
278,0.97,1996.361,2002.834,"So, I realize this is not a popular position in my district, and supporters of my will be asking me for a long time how could you support Councilmember Sawant?",34,,
279,0.97,2002.834,2021.452,"What I would like to assure all of my constituents, that what I am actually supporting and honoring are the facts as I know them, the thoughtful approval of our elected city attorney, and the Crystal-Clear precedent set by a previous city Council, which approved the same accommodation for a previous Councilmember.",34,,
280,0.97,2021.452,2027.692,"So, ultimately, this is something that would be decided by voters in district 3 if the recall petition advances.",34,,
281,0.97,2027.692,2036.934,"Today's action, if approved, would merely provide a modicum of legal assistance to the duly elected official who was the subject of the recall petition.",34,,
282,0.97,2036.934,2040.038,"So, I will be voting yes.",34,,
283,0.97,2040.038,2040.371,Thank you.,34,,
284,0.97,2040.371,2041.372,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,35,,
285,0.97,2041.372,2045.877,"For that, are there any other comments on the bill?",35,,
286,0.97,2045.877,2052.417,"Hearing none, colleagues, I will close out Debate-Just kidding.",35,,
287,0.97,2052.417,2057.688,Councilmember Strauss.,35,,
288,0.97,2057.688,2057.955,Please.,35,,
289,0.97,2057.955,2061.692,Thank you Council President.,36,,
290,0.97,2061.692,2062.193,"I, too.",36,,
291,0.97,2062.193,2068.199,Have read the Rcw s Councilmember Juarez had interpreted it with the subsection 4 being relevant to our conversation today.,36,,
292,0.97,2068.199,2078.443,"And, I am not sure that the actions our colleague took were within the scope of her official duties.",36,,
293,0.97,2078.443,2087.385,"That being said, hearing from you today regarding the subsection 3 is the only section that we need to address.",36,,
294,0.97,2087.385,2096.194,"You know, what I would say is that over the course of the last few months, there have been, and I have been the recipient of, quite divisive language etc.",36,,
295,0.97,2096.194,2097.628,And that is not pertinent for here.,36,,
296,0.97,2097.628,2103.534,I would love to see our Council work together in a collaborative way.,36,,
297,0.97,2103.534,2108.039,And I know the majority of us do and do so regularly.,36,,
298,0.97,2108.039,2111.142,I won't be Commenting on the merits of the recall petition today.,36,,
299,0.97,2111.142,2121.152,"And s Councilmember Pedersen said, we need to have important legal representation during this course of due process.",36,,
300,0.97,2121.152,2127.625,"To understand what is a judicial matter, rather than a legislative matter.",36,,
301,0.97,2127.625,2138.569,"And with the election having just occurred, this is a very serious matter that needs to have full legal representation.",36,,
302,0.97,2138.569,2155.186,"Now, I would also say that we can't continue to fund legal representation for behavior that is not within the bounds of our roles as elected officials.",36,,
303,0.97,2155.186,2158.189,"So, it is important to take this on a case-by-case basis.",36,,
304,0.97,2158.189,2170.268,"And, with your Mama providing your analysis from the law Department regarding the only section we need to be advised on a subsection 3, I will take that under consideration.",36,,
305,0.97,2170.268,2174.005,Thank you Council President.,36,,
306,0.97,2174.005,2176.941,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,37,,
307,0.97,2176.941,2181.612,Are there any other comments on the middle?,37,,
308,0.97,2181.612,2195.426,"Hearing on, I'll go ahead and close out debate by making some final remarks before I asked the clerk to call the role on this particular bill.",37,,
309,0.97,2195.426,2215.913,"So, again, colleagues, I appreciate the opportunity to have a conversation here, and you know, while there is no sponsor and this ordinance does not require a sponsor for us to consider it, I do take the role of being Council President very seriously.",37,,
310,0.97,2215.913,2224.722,"And, I assure you that if any of you found yourself in the situation and you chose to make this request for indemnification, I would give you the same due consideration.",37,,
311,0.97,2224.722,2250.848,"And, regardless of whether or not we have agreed with each other in the past, and regardless of whether or not I agree with tactics that are deployed by Councilmembers in their individual roles as independently elected officials, I think it is important for us to stay true to the requirements, legal requirements that are before us.",37,,
312,0.97,2250.848,2264.262,There are many instances in our society in which legal defense is provided to individuals that have been accused of wrongdoing.,37,,
313,0.97,2264.262,2265.129,Those accusations run the gamut.,37,,
314,0.97,2265.129,2273.037,"And we have, as a country, establish constitutionally that people are entitled to legal defense.",37,,
315,0.97,2273.037,2278.476,"And if they cannot afford a legal defense, then counsel would be provided to them.",37,,
316,0.97,2278.476,2284.548,That is commonly known as public defense across our entire system.,37,,
317,0.97,2284.548,2296.727,"For those people who think it is extraordinary to use taxpayer dollars to pay for legal defense, this is not a novel idea.",37,,
318,0.97,2296.727,2312.81,"As we have a criminal justice system built on the concept of providing free legal defense to those people who request it, because they are not in a position to provide themselves with their own legal counsel.",37,,
319,0.97,2312.81,2325.723,"I was say that subsection 3, which is the only applicable section in this consideration is inherently structured to be minimal.",37,,
320,0.97,2325.723,2331.028,"As Councilmember Herbold highlighted, there is not a lot of guidance there.",37,,
321,0.97,2331.028,2331.862,It is pretty Bare-Bones.,37,,
322,0.97,2331.862,2365.329,"Which is legislators means that we can read into the legislative intent, which could means that it applies of the legal defense under the context of the recall charges is so significant and the consequences of a recall charger so significant given the gravity of potentially canceling out the will of thousands of voters that in those instances, legal defense should be readily available, as long as the minimal requirements of subsection 3 has been met, which has been done.",37,,
323,0.97,2365.329,2385.683,"I also want to say that there have been some comments about trying to compare this particular counsel bill to what may or may not have been taken advantage of by Mayor Durkin, Councilmember Lewis spoke to this momentarily.",37,,
324,0.97,2385.683,2391.889,"I do want to reiterate that every elected official within the city of Seattle, should they find themselves in a similar situation, does have the statutory right to make this request.",37,,
325,0.97,2391.889,2394.625,But that is a voluntary act that the elected official has to trigger themselves.,37,,
326,0.97,2394.625,2396.527,"And, we all make those choices.",37,,
327,0.97,2396.527,2398.896,Personally.,37,,
328,0.97,2398.896,2421.719,"And did pending on our own personal circumstances, and I agree with Councilmember Lewis had Mayor Durkin made a request for this or any of you made a request with this because you found yourselves in the same situation, I would have given at the same, fair and due consideration that we are giving this bill today, regardless of anything else.",37,,
329,0.97,2421.719,2428.159,"So, with that being said, I am going to go ahead and officially close out debate.",37,,
330,0.97,2428.159,2430.628,I want to thank you all again for making yourselves available today.,37,,
