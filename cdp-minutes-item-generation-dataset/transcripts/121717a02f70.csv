107,0.97,618.751,619.485,Okay.,44,,
108,0.97,619.485,642.041,"City Council's policies Unfortunately are undermining public safety and the police chief is sabotaging every specialty unit and Prioritizing overtime at events while blaming homeless, Po Lirkstricking the community as if building trust through coffee outreach and Sim PA nations with victims is going to help improve public safety and the image of the cops.",44,,
109,0.97,642.041,679.278,"It's obvious city council already sabotaged police reform by ensuring that drug pushers will be exempted from jail for selling crack, Meth, and heroin, running interference, for evil, destroying lives daily, low level misdemeanor is the epitome and the root cause of all of our problems as far as the homeless and the innocents who are being victimized regularly while Council refused to help the homeless crisis to build capacity to Aleve 80 all the unnecessary suffering.",44,,
110,0.97,679.278,692.792,"Instead, city council redirected over $70 million of the American rescue plan dollars to newly created Nonprofits claiming expert on community safety, alternative policing, and racial equity.",44,,
111,0.97,692.792,711.177,"Arguably buying off protesters from black lives matter and George Ployed protesters who are dictating police reform, Intimidating Council, overseeing our public safety, and watering down the effects and the efforts distracted with buying up a Union of delivery drivers.",44,,
112,0.97,711.177,723.722,This is further proof that city hall cannot be trusted to do what is right versus what appear Peases Browbeating bully devils advocates and organizers and protesters.,44,,
113,0.97,723.722,750.816,Please consider resigning your oversight of the public safety and the homeless crisis because you've failed to alleviate the concerns of the community while we add new Council that's watering down the efforts and still blaming the innocent homeless while Prioritizing repeat have offending evil criminals as the first priority.,44,,

118,0.97,768.467,774.273,We have been studying the police contracts with the past year and sent awe detailed letter June 5th.,46,,
119,0.97,774.273,787.353,Today I want to call your attention to a particular clause in the proposed contract that gives past practices superiority over new contract language.,46,,
120,0.97,787.353,795.227,This cause could prevent future disciplinary actions in support of best police practices and community expectations.,46,,
121,0.97,795.227,802.234,And this kind of superiority clause would be an even bigger problem if it is included N the upcoming contract with the police Guild.,46,,
122,0.97,802.234,812.178,So please find a way to prevent former bad precedence from blocking future progress and we thank you for your attention to this important topic.,46,,

149,0.97,899.632,913.212,"I'm a member of Proactive persistent people for progress, P-4, because the other is such a mouthful, and it's a local group working to strengthen democracy and advocate for Progressive values.",60,,
150,0.97,913.212,913.946,I have three requests.,60,,
151,0.97,913.946,926.458,"I listened yesterday and heard several statements indicating that the city, as required by ordinance, asks for recommendations from the office of Inspector general, the office of police accountability, and the community police Commission.",60,,
152,0.97,926.458,930.462,And that these recommendations were considered as part of the negotiating process.,60,,
153,0.97,930.462,951.583,"And letters to the Mayor and the Council all three accountability organizations recommended as one of their key items that the city engage in external adviser with accountability expertise in the bargaining process, in part to advise the city on how bargain terms affect accountability effectiveness.",60,,
154,0.97,951.583,956.889,The rationale was that endorsed by the oversight would further enhance trust in this process.,60,,
155,0.97,956.889,964.563,"We ask you in your deliberations today to find out if this recommendation was followed, and if not, why not.",60,,
156,0.97,964.563,975.741,Will the Council make a commitment today to encourage the Mayor to follow this recommendation and other recommendations from the three police accountability org new Cations?,60,,
157,0.97,975.741,990.522,"If the police accountability structure is to work and resulted Unmore effective than just policing, Oig, O.P.A., and the C PC must have a strong voice, a voice that Goth Council and Mayor listen to.",60,,
158,0.97,990.522,1000.399,"Without that Seattle is left with an accountability structure that may look good on paper, but lacks real authority to provide adequate oversight.",60,,
159,0.97,1000.399,1009.775,"This will begin to build a more transparent process and hopefully result in greater trust between the city, the Seattle police Department, and the people that are served.",60,,

170,0.97,1043.542,1052.05,"In February of 2021, the C PC made several recommendations regarding the SPD's collective bargaining agreement process.",65,,
171,0.97,1052.05,1066.598,They recommended that the reforms in the 2017 accountability ordinance be fully implemented and that the public remain fully informed about both content and process as the negotiations proceeded.,65,,
172,0.97,1066.598,1078.61,My first request is that the Council release information about which of these recommendations were followed and which were not and why.,65,,
173,0.97,1078.61,1085.25,And that those recommendations also be used in the negotiations that have recommend begun.,65,,
174,0.97,1085.25,1096.829,"Secondly, there is a widespread recognition of a need to build public trust, moving beyond constitutional policing, to policing that meets community expectations.",65,,
175,0.97,1096.829,1125.023,"My second request is that the Council recognize how these agreements advance both structural, that is more legal, and perceived, that is community, legitimacy in its deliberations on both the CBA Thanes front of you now and your participation in the negotiations with Sfog that is upcoming.",65,,
176,0.97,1125.023,1128.393,Thank you for the opportunity to share my comments.,65,,
