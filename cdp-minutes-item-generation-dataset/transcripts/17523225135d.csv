576,0.97,3571.668,3577.941,"Colleagues, this is a landmark designating ordinance for the Bordeaux House located on 14th Avenue.",149,,
577,0.97,3577.941,3579.976,It was built in 1903.,149,,
578,0.97,3579.976,3581.377,Altered in 1913.,149,,
579,0.97,3581.377,3590.086,The landmark preservation board was amended designation based on two criteria.,149,,

581,0.97,3595.858,3597.093,Controls would apply to the site.,149,,
582,0.97,3597.093,3604.968,The building exterior in the entry and Stairwell on the interior--on the main entrance.,149,,
583,0.97,3604.968,3619.615,We have the building owners present with us and Committee who spoke about the desire to steward this in a historic way as they are guests within the home even though they own it.,149,,

593,0.97,3684.547,3698.161,"Agenda item 12, council bill 120081 and ordinance relating to affordable housing on properties owned or controlled by religious organizations, modifying existing development standards to facilitate creation of affordable housing.",154,,
594,0.97,3698.161,3701.197,The committee recommends the bill pass as amended.,154,,
595,0.97,3701.197,3705.568,Thank you so much.,155,,
596,0.97,3705.568,3710.673,"Once again, this comes out of Councilmember Strauss' committee, so back over to him to walk us through this item.",155,,
597,0.97,3710.673,3715.611,"Thank you, Council President.",156,,
598,0.97,3715.611,3720.249,"Colleagues, this would grant zoning flexibility to affordable housing developers on land owned or controlled by religious organizations.",156,,
599,0.97,3720.249,3723.219,This is a long-awaited bill.,156,,
600,0.97,3723.219,3732.895,"It first was passed by a state Legislature, and we are now taking it up here within the city to make it the law within our city.",156,,
601,0.97,3732.895,3741.404,"So, there are many projects that are already underway, assuming that the language contained in the state bill would be passed at a city level.",156,,
602,0.97,3741.404,3749.746,These are long-awaited changes that stem from what was already adopted at the Legislature.,156,,
603,0.97,3749.746,3752.815,"In most cases, affordable housing, on eligible sites would be given one additional story of height.",156,,
604,0.97,3752.815,3755.051,Then single-family zones.,156,,
605,0.97,3755.051,3767.663,"Additional capacity would be granted without raising maximum heights and in some of the Denser multifamily and Midrise zones, additional floors beyond the one floor would be granted.",156,,
606,0.97,3767.663,3777.173,"In order to qualify for this flexibility, sites would need to be owned or controlled by a religious institution, and the housing would be required to be affordable to households making up to 80% of the area median income.",156,,
607,0.97,3777.173,3791.053,"We do expect that for the majority, most of these projects using this flexibility, will be providing affordable homes to incomes below 60% area median income due to the office of housing's requirements for funding.",156,,
608,0.97,3791.053,3805.568,"If they cite dollars, they already have to meet the 60% area median income threshold providing housing to people at 60% area median income or below.",156,,
609,0.97,3805.568,3821.984,The difference between the 60% and 80% its flexibility that the Legislature wanted to provide for institutions to use private dollars rather than city funded--city funds to create this affordable housing.,156,,
610,0.97,3821.984,3823.619,This is flexibility I have heard is desired.,156,,
611,0.97,3823.619,3836.732,"We have heard from the greater--the church Council of greater Seattle that they would appreciate this flexibility, at least initially so we can see if this flexibility is going to be used as intended, or if not.",156,,
612,0.97,3836.732,3842.538,That's part of why I really appreciated Council member Pedersen's amendment to the bill.,156,,
613,0.97,3842.538,3857.954,"The Office of housing and the Land-Use committee chose to leave the requirement at 80% area median income because we had heard, as I said, there is interest from churches to see if this middle income could be possible without city subsidy.",156,,
614,0.97,3857.954,3871.934,Additionally we've heard from the church Council of greater Seattle who were again opposed to the lowering of the 80% threshold out of concern it would exclude churches from navigating an already difficult process of financing and permitting affordable housing.,156,,
615,0.97,3871.934,3881.878,"I am excited, I am excited to see this legislation passed today to open up more possibilities for much-needed affordable housing across the city.",156,,
616,0.97,3881.878,3887.383,I expect to see an immediate impact as there are projects awaiting this bill to pass.,156,,
617,0.97,3887.383,3889.885,Today before we can begin development processes.,156,,
618,0.97,3889.885,3899.896,"As we confront a homeless and housing crisis, or creative solutions like this are necessary to ensure we are doing all we can to meet these challenges at the scale of the crisis.",156,,
619,0.97,3899.896,3903.399,"Colleagues, and happy to take additional questions.",156,,
620,0.97,3903.399,3906.502,That is the committee report at this time.,156,,
621,0.97,3906.502,3910.206,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss.",157,,
622,0.97,3910.206,3912.675,We do have a couple of amendments as discussed this morning.,157,,
623,0.97,3912.675,3914.377,During Council briefing.,157,,
624,0.97,3914.377,3924.52,"We are going to go ahead and consider the proposed amendments, amendment one and amendment two both come from Councilmember Herbold.",157,,
625,0.97,3924.52,3926.422,We will have debate on each of those amendments.,157,,
626,0.97,3926.422,3932.328,"Then, we will take a vote on the respective amendments.",157,,
627,0.97,3932.328,3940.136,"Then, I will open up the floor for discussion and conversation on the bill.",157,,
628,0.97,3940.136,3944.707,"As amended, or not amended.",157,,
629,0.97,3944.707,3954.417,"So, if you are hoping to comment on the bill as a whole, before final passage, you will have an opportunity to do so.",157,,
630,0.97,3954.417,3969.465,Right now what we are going to do is focus our energy on the two proposed amendments that Councilmember Herbold discussed during this morning's Council briefing with a slight modification to amendment one as I understand it.,157,,
631,0.97,3969.465,3972.735,"So, I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Herbold to make a motion on amendments one",157,,
632,0.97,3972.735,3974.971,Thank you so much.,158,,
633,0.97,3974.971,3982.278,I moved to amend Council bill 120081 as presented on the recently distributed amendment one B.,158,,
634,0.97,3982.278,3986.682,Second.,159,,
635,0.97,3986.682,3995.391,"It has been moved and Seconded to amend the bill as presented on amendment one I'm going to head over to Councilmember Herbold to walk us, and the viewing public through amendment one as proposed.",160,,
636,0.97,3995.391,3996.959,Thank you.,161,,
637,0.97,3996.959,4014.81,"Amendment one B would lower the average affordable housing income eligibility threshold to 60% of AMI, average median income, for Renters whose household, after an initial period at 80%.",161,,
638,0.97,4014.81,4015.978,Average median income.,161,,
639,0.97,4015.978,4026.088,State law requires a minimum 80% AMI Affordability and allows cities lower Affordability requirements.,161,,
640,0.97,4026.088,4032.027,"Just like we do with Mste, the multi family tax exemption program.",161,,
641,0.97,4032.027,4044.94,That too sets a minimum Affordability requirement and we have as the polity body have deepened those Affordability requirements under the Mfte program.,161,,
642,0.97,4044.94,4048.444,Most recently under the leadership of Councilmember Mosqueda.,161,,
643,0.97,4048.444,4064.927,"In response to the concerns that I heard from Councilmember Strauss this morning, I've offered the amendment to change the effective date of the average 60% AMI until not be effective until July 1ST, 2022.",161,,
644,0.97,4064.927,4072.068,So that any projects that are currently in the pipeline that had been operating under the state's law will have the certainty that they need.,161,,
645,0.97,4072.068,4078.574,80% AMI rent for a studio is $1620.,161,,
646,0.97,4078.574,4085.648,"For a One-Bedroom, it is $1851.",161,,
647,0.97,4085.648,4088.484,We do not need to Incentivize private developers to build units at these rents.,161,,
648,0.97,4088.484,4091.287,It is practically market rate rent already.,161,,
649,0.97,4091.287,4114.81,"If we do that, if we create an incentive for churches to work with private developers to build these basically rather expensive affordable housing units, there will be fewer mission based nonprofit developers Partnering with these same religious institutions unless rentals at a lower Affordability rate.",161,,
650,0.97,4114.81,4122.251,I really hope this compromised version of this amendment can be supported by the Council today.,161,,
651,0.97,4122.251,4123.018,Thank you.,161,,
652,0.97,4123.018,4126.021,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold.",162,,

656,0.97,4134.897,4140.002,I hear your--and I thank you for making that change.,163,,
657,0.97,4140.002,4144.707,I did give you a call.,163,,
658,0.97,4144.707,4148.911,We want able to connect by phone so I think some of this could have been worked out on the phone.,163,,
659,0.97,4148.911,4152.948,At this time it is important for me to see if this program actually exists.,163,,
660,0.97,4152.948,4155.251,And that this flexibility is actually used.,163,,
661,0.97,4155.251,4170.533,"As we know and as I stated a moment ago the majority, if not all these projects that will be using this flexibility will receive city funds that require meeting the needs that you just respond.",163,,
662,0.97,4170.533,4186.048,It is important to me that we provide--the church Council of greater Seattle who are the majority Stakeholders who would be utilizing this flexibility had called in and testified that they would not support this amendment.,163,,
663,0.97,4186.048,4198.594,It was important to me that we respect that request.,163,,
664,0.97,4198.594,4205.968,That's why it would be important for us to take this up in a year when we have the data that Councilmember Pedersen has requested in our hands to review the effectiveness of this plan.,163,,
665,0.97,4205.968,4215.211,I share your concerns of wanting to have more affordable housing at lower rates and that's why I would still be open to the conversation.,163,,
666,0.97,4215.211,4218.914,Because I know of the number of projects that are waiting for this to pass.,163,,
667,0.97,4218.914,4221.183,I do not want to delay this today.,163,,
668,0.97,4221.183,4223.185,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",163,,
669,0.97,4223.185,4229.225,Are there any additional comments?,164,,
670,0.97,4229.225,4230.092,"Councilmember Pedersen, please.",164,,
671,0.97,4230.092,4245.24,"Thank you, Council president and thank you Councilmember Herbold for bringing these amendments forward today.",165,,
672,0.97,4245.24,4252.781,"The city council central staff memo when this bill was put forward, sort of laid out issue identification.",165,,
673,0.97,4252.781,4260.055,It mentioned this as one of the issues to potentially lower the Affordability threshold.,165,,
674,0.97,4260.055,4269.465,"Which the state, the bipartisan state bill representing the entire state, put it at 80%.",165,,
675,0.97,4269.465,4278.641,I think that I support Councilmember Herbold's remarks here we are trying make it for very low income residents.,165,,
676,0.97,4278.641,4294.79,"I appreciate that it has the averaging so that you can bring in folks who are experiencing homelessness at 30% AMI or lower and try to average it out with higher AMI, but still the average being at 60%.",165,,
677,0.97,4294.79,4299.194,Appreciate that you put in that one year grace period.,165,,
678,0.97,4299.194,4301.196,"So, I'll be supporting this amendment.",165,,
679,0.97,4301.196,4303.599,Thank you for bringing it forward.,165,,
680,0.97,4303.599,4307.569,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",166,,
681,0.97,4307.569,4308.804,Councilmember Morales.,166,,
682,0.97,4308.804,4314.41,Thank you.,167,,
683,0.97,4314.41,4317.479,I will admit I'm a little Conflicted here.,167,,
684,0.97,4317.479,4328.524,I totally agree that we do need to be providing more options for housing that is affordable at lower rates at 60%.,167,,
685,0.97,4328.524,4339.835,I am concerned that this amendment would hinder religious organizations that could build affordable housing without public finance.,167,,
686,0.97,4339.835,4344.34,"As there has been indication some could, and some are interested in.",167,,
687,0.97,4344.34,4355.417,"So at this time, I don't think I can support an amendment that would impede the synagogues and churches in my district from developing affordable housing for their seniors.",167,,
688,0.97,4355.417,4359.054,I know that there are some projects that are hoping to get started just that way.,167,,
689,0.97,4359.054,4362.925,So at this time I will not be supporting this amendment.,167,,
690,0.97,4362.925,4366.662,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",168,,
691,0.97,4366.662,4369.064,I have a quick question.,168,,
692,0.97,4369.064,4381.877,"So, Councilmember Herbold, it's clear in that the Council wants to create more affordable housing.",168,,
693,0.97,4381.877,4385.381,I think we are all aligned in that desire and the intent.,168,,
694,0.97,4385.381,4391.186,I think that amendment 1B is designed to hopefully create that incentive.,168,,
695,0.97,4391.186,4417.412,"What I'm hearing from the organizations that would be impacted by this legislation that they are concerned that in practice, the intent, or sort of the theory that we are presenting in amendment 1B may not be able to executed in practice.",168,,
696,0.97,4417.412,4435.731,"I guess I'm wondering whether you come and your office, have done any analysis on that particular concern that has been expressed by religious institutions who have an interest in participating in the program as structured?",168,,
697,0.97,4435.731,4452.614,This amendment is intended to Diss Incentivize religious institutions Partnering with anybody other than mission based nonprofit affordable housing providers.,169,,
698,0.97,4452.614,4455.451,"If it's at 60%, they are going to partner.",169,,
699,0.97,4455.451,4471.667,"If it's at 80%, there is no reason for there is no reason for a religious institution to partner with the nonprofit because the nonprofit is already going to be doing the 60%.",169,,
700,0.97,4471.667,4480.742,"They are then going to look at a partnership that will result in a higher yield, a higher return to the religious institution.",169,,
701,0.97,4480.742,4495.257,I'm very concerned that we are talking about the position of the owners of the property as that is the thing that we should be driving our policymaking.,169,,
702,0.97,4495.257,4505.1,Our policymaking is really about creating--identifying the affordable housing that we need to build in our city.,169,,
703,0.97,4505.1,4508.203,Listening to people who would operate under those regulations.,169,,
704,0.97,4508.203,4511.506,And delivering policy that reflects the needs of our city.,169,,
705,0.97,4511.506,4527.723,"I am not surprised that an advocacy organization that is representing, in this case, as fine as I am as the advocacy of the church Council, they are advocating for the interests of the property owners in this case.",169,,
706,0.97,4527.723,4548.443,"Just like we hear from private property owners when we are debating Mha or Mfte, property owners have an inclination to prefer more flexibility with the potential for greater financial return.",169,,
707,0.97,4548.443,4555.551,I believe our decisions today should be based on the type of housing that we want to see developed using these incentives.,169,,
708,0.97,4555.551,4561.957,"Councilmember Herbold, I don't necessarily disagree with your analysis.",170,,
709,0.97,4561.957,4584.579,"My question is about the kind of housing stock we want to create and whether we are--whether your amendment advances, in practice, not in theory, but if it will--if it will actually be achieved.",170,,
710,0.97,4584.579,4598.493,"I'll just sort of lay it out there, I don't want to support an amendment that is in theory, values the line in sending the right signals, but then in practice may not actually come to fruition.",170,,
711,0.97,4598.493,4624.219,"That's what my question is about is about when you say that there is--these religious organizations who are property owners that are interested in developing the property for affordable housing, that they will find someone who will construct at 60% AMI . I guess my question is, is, how--how do you know that?",170,,
712,0.97,4624.219,4626.688,Has there been an analysis on that component?,170,,
713,0.97,4626.688,4643.538,"We have been told that the units that are at 60% AMI, they are developed under this regulation, the would, in effect have city dollars mm because they would be built by Nonprofits.",171,,
714,0.97,4643.538,4653.749,"We have heard from members of our nonprofit developer community, Sharon Lee has contacted I think many of us in support of this amendment.",171,,
715,0.97,4653.749,4668.363,"I don't know if she was signing the letter that we all received from the center area Land-Use Committee in her capacity as a neighbor, or her capacity as an employee of the housing.",171,,
716,0.97,4668.363,4678.373,But Donna Moody signed the letter from the central area Land-Use Committee in support of a similar amendment to the one that is before us right now.,171,,
717,0.97,4678.373,4695.59,"So, based on that letter you believe that there are nonprofit housing developers who would be available and ready to participate with religious organizations to Effectually the intent of amendment 1B?",172,,
718,0.97,4695.59,4697.392,I do.,173,,
719,0.97,4697.392,4698.26,Okay.,174,,
720,0.97,4698.26,4700.462,Okay.,174,,
721,0.97,4700.462,4703.098,"Councilmember Strauss, I see you have your hand up.",174,,
722,0.97,4703.098,4707.402,"Thank you, Council President.",175,,
723,0.97,4707.402,4718.513,I think what I heard Councilmember Herbold say is there is no incentive for property owners to use to get to 60% AMI.,175,,
724,0.97,4718.513,4730.826,"I just need to call off the fact that in the previous statements, and I've set a couple times today, the majority, if not almost all these projects will most likely be using city funds requiring 60% AMI.",175,,
725,0.97,4730.826,4744.94,"The flexibility that we are looking at is to see if, and to your point just now, to all of the nonprofit housing developers have the capacity to take on all of the projects that have now opened under this new legislation?",175,,
726,0.97,4744.94,4747.242,That's the question we just don't actually know the answer to.,175,,
727,0.97,4747.242,4757.052,We also don't know how many of these institutions have the capacity to do that private fundraising to utilize that 20% flexibility of the AMI.,175,,
728,0.97,4757.052,4760.722,These are questions not yet known.,175,,
729,0.97,4760.722,4763.291,I believe that we need to provide as much flexibility as possible.,175,,
730,0.97,4763.291,4772.334,And also not--I think we just need to allow as much flexibility as possible for the next year.,175,,
731,0.97,4772.334,4776.037,I'm happy to come back this in a year from now and analyze the data and make changes.,175,,
732,0.97,4776.037,4777.239,"Or, come back sooner than that.",175,,
733,0.97,4777.239,4784.846,"I do think that at this time we make sure in my committee to have this, to have this bill before us twice.",175,,
734,0.97,4784.846,4792.287,So we met my desire to have the committee review and ordinance twice before passing it.,175,,
735,0.97,4792.287,4797.325,We are doing so as quickly as possible because we know there are churches waiting to utilize this policy as Writtenfrom the state.,175,,
736,0.97,4797.325,4798.193,Thank you.,175,,
737,0.97,4798.193,4806.701,Okay.,176,,
738,0.97,4806.701,4813.108,"Councilmember Herbold, you would get the last word, so I just want to scan the room and make sure no one else has any questions or comments on amendment 1B.",176,,
739,0.97,4813.108,4814.81,"Councilmember Pedersen, please.",176,,
740,0.97,4814.81,4818.079,"Thank you, Council President.",177,,
741,0.97,4818.079,4821.583,Just a point of verification for the people viewing this.,177,,
742,0.97,4821.583,4826.321,The 80% AMI is still for the homeownership projects.,177,,
743,0.97,4826.321,4833.295,This amendment applies just to the rental residential.,177,,
744,0.97,4833.295,4842.103,"So, there is flexibility already built in for homeownership projects where you tend to look for a higher AMI to be able to afford the mortgages.",177,,
745,0.97,4842.103,4845.507,That is there.,177,,
746,0.97,4845.507,4848.343,So those religious organizations that want to pursue homeownership projects will still have the 80%.,177,,
747,0.97,4848.343,4850.845,"Then, this amendment applies just to the rental housing.",177,,
748,0.97,4850.845,4852.414,Just wanted to clarify that.,177,,
749,0.97,4852.414,4853.915,Thank you.,177,,
750,0.97,4853.915,4856.551,"Okay, thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",178,,
751,0.97,4856.551,4863.158,Any other comments before I ask Councilmember Herbold to close out debate?,178,,
752,0.97,4863.158,4865.493,"Councilmember Mosqueda, I've seen you come Off-Camera couple times.",178,,
753,0.97,4865.493,4868.063,Would you like to add anything?,178,,
754,0.97,4868.063,4871.132,I'll give you a minute to settle in.,178,,
755,0.97,4871.132,4873.168,"Thank you, Council President.",179,,
756,0.97,4873.168,4876.738,I'm seeking a cooler room.,179,,
757,0.97,4876.738,4881.276,Apologies for the change in location.,179,,
758,0.97,4881.276,4883.745,I appreciate the opportunity to again weigh in on this.,179,,
759,0.97,4883.745,4903.798,"I do want to make sure I clarify for the record, there is not currently a policy that I think we could put into place to quote deter nonprofit developers from developing affordable housing more than 1600 for example.",179,,
760,0.97,4903.798,4908.069,The fact that rental units are so high is in part because we do not have enough rental units.,179,,
761,0.97,4908.069,4917.178,It's not a matter of whether or not there is developers who are shaking certain price points.,179,,
762,0.97,4917.178,4923.985,"If we want to address the cost of those rental units, I think one of the best things we can do through this legislation is increase the amount of rental units in Seattle.",179,,
763,0.97,4923.985,4925.22,Across the market.,179,,
764,0.97,4925.22,4927.489,Especially up to 80% AMI.,179,,
765,0.97,4927.489,4940.402,"All of the lack of housing as pointed out by the study that came out now twice in the last few years, has constantly shown that we don't have enough housing, including at 80% AMI for affordable housing units.",179,,
766,0.97,4940.402,4947.242,All of that puts downward pressure on affordable units across the market.,179,,
767,0.97,4947.242,4956.851,I again will be not supporting this amendment because I do think that it is counter to the shared goals which is making sure there is more affordable housing units out there overall.,179,,
768,0.97,4956.851,4972.334,"That we are doing everything we can working with these current--property owners who are part of religious institutions who have said help us develop this parking lot, or this empty space into affordable housing.",179,,
769,0.97,4972.334,4983.178,"I think we can work as fast as possible to build those affordable units up to 80% AMI, it will actually help those who are at six percent or below.",179,,
770,0.97,4983.178,4991.686,I apologize for not having that typed out to be able to more eloquently make the point as I've been shuffling through very warm rooms.,179,,
771,0.97,4991.686,5006.901,"Hope that the point gets across that if we can encourage as many housing developers to build affordable units, including at 80% AMI and below it does absolutely, the data shows that it does support affordable units.",179,,
772,0.97,5006.901,5010.105,Opening up for our folks that are below those levels as well.,179,,
773,0.97,5010.105,5018.313,Appreciate the leadership of Councilmember Strauss on the bill as it came out of committee and look forward to supporting that today.,179,,
774,0.97,5018.313,5023.418,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",180,,
775,0.97,5023.418,5028.39,I now have Councilmember Sawant in the Queue so I'm going to give her an opportunity to make some comments before we close out debate.,180,,
776,0.97,5028.39,5029.624,"Councilmember Sawant, please.",180,,
777,0.97,5029.624,5043.938,I just wanted to second the points that Councilmember Herbold made in explaining why this amendment makes sense.,181,,
778,0.97,5043.938,5049.911,I think all the points you made are absolutely based in fact.,181,,
779,0.97,5049.911,5064.559,For the church Council . respect my office has worked with the church Council and with many other faith leaders.,181,,
780,0.97,5064.559,5073.334,We will continue to do so including the project I mentioned this morning in briefing that my office is going to be advocating for.,181,,
781,0.97,5073.334,5085.046,"I'm hoping that the rest of the Council will support affordable housing projects, especially in the central district, but also in other areas.",181,,
782,0.97,5085.046,5089.551,We need to continue that United work.,181,,
783,0.97,5089.551,5100.395,I think in this case it is a little bit akin to the debate that the then Council had on the question of mandatory housing Affordability.,181,,
784,0.97,5100.395,5109.07,"It is a similar situation here where with or without this amendment, what we are talking about are changes on the margin really.",181,,
785,0.97,5109.07,5142.537,"As I have said before, the main objective that the Chamber of Commerce in the corporate landlord lobby had with the Mha was not so much that they were getting a whole lot, what they did gain though was completely drowning the affordable housing debate at that time into this question of very esoteric affordable, questions of the Mha related legislation with they didn't really ultimately talk about actual Affordability.",181,,
786,0.97,5142.537,5147.242,I think I am supporting this amendment.,181,,
787,0.97,5147.242,5153.014,I am going to say a few things in addition to what Councilmember Herbold said.,181,,
788,0.97,5153.014,5172.233,"I wanted to say, and this is my message to you also my friends at the church Council and others, even though we may not agree on this particular amendment, I think we have to going forward really continue to work together to Massively expand affordable housing.",181,,
789,0.97,5172.233,5174.736,"Because the prices is so acute, the Affordability crisis is acute.",181,,
790,0.97,5174.736,5187.482,I do think it is unfortunate that politicians continue repeating the supply side arguments about how it is mainly the lack of--number of rental units that is causing the Affordability crisis.,181,,
791,0.97,5187.482,5189.951,This is not borne out by the data.,181,,
792,0.97,5189.951,5194.789,"Ultimately, yes, of course we need--do we need more density?",181,,
793,0.97,5194.789,5196.991,Absolutely.,181,,
794,0.97,5196.991,5203.031,"Do we need much more of a zoning change in the city to allow multiple housing units, like apartment buildings, to be built?",181,,
795,0.97,5203.031,5204.666,Absolutely.,181,,
796,0.97,5204.666,5206.901,Do we need more housing to be built?,181,,
797,0.97,5206.901,5211.005,Absolutely.,181,,
798,0.97,5211.005,5216.211,All of that is true and yet none of it makes it true that the lack of the number of rental units is the problem.,181,,
799,0.97,5216.211,5217.612,This is a supplied side argument.,181,,
800,0.97,5217.612,5219.48,This is an argument that the real estate industry makes.,181,,
801,0.97,5219.48,5227.288,This is what property management corporation say and you will suddenly not catch me making those arguments.,181,,
802,0.97,5227.288,5230.325,At the end of the day it's a question of Affordability.,181,,
803,0.97,5230.325,5232.393,Simply building more does not ensure Affordability.,181,,
804,0.97,5232.393,5239.734,"As an economist, I'm speaking in terms of just having looked at the data.",181,,
805,0.97,5239.734,5246.741,"There is no economist in this world that can tell you that Okay, you build up to this critical threshold and then housing will start becoming affordable because rents will start coming down.",181,,
806,0.97,5246.741,5251.446,There is no evidence to show that happens.,181,,
807,0.97,5251.446,5252.747,There is simply no empirical evidence.,181,,
808,0.97,5252.747,5255.016,"As a matter of fact, in the Pre- pandemic.",181,,
809,0.97,5255.016,5257.819,"Matt, Seattle was a construction Crane capital of the world Pre-Years running.",181,,
810,0.97,5257.819,5269.53,"If you look at the data, and you plan to be Data-Driven, none of these arguments are supported by the argument that that is the main reason for the lack of Affordability is not supported.",181,,
811,0.97,5269.53,5271.065,Do we need more expansion?,181,,
812,0.97,5271.065,5274.068,Absolutely.,181,,
813,0.97,5274.068,5278.773,I also think there are important arguments that are being made by affordable housing providers.,181,,
814,0.97,5278.773,5295.79,"One is that when you look at 80% area median income, if you look at the actual numbers in terms of what the rent actually is, it happens to be market rate in some cases.",181,,
815,0.97,5295.79,5302.797,It's just difficult to believe that it is not possible to build housing more Affordably than that.,181,,
816,0.97,5302.797,5312.907,We know there are housing providers that can build to greater Affordability if there are avenues for them to get those opportunities.,181,,
817,0.97,5312.907,5322.717,There are public funding options available for even 80% area medium income housing like 4% Federal tax credits.,181,,
818,0.97,5322.717,5329.424,"So, I will be supporting this amendment because from everything I've seen, the housing can be made more affordable than 80% AMI.",181,,
819,0.97,5329.424,5336.631,"I think it should be, just if you look at the rents that qualified 80% AMI, they are like market rate units.",181,,
820,0.97,5336.631,5343.104,It's quite stunning when you see the numbers.,181,,
821,0.97,5343.104,5346.808,"As I said, I support this amendment.",181,,
822,0.97,5346.808,5357.819,My office continue to look forward to working with the faith community on really pushing for affordable housing in continuing to make the city much more affordable than it is today.,181,,
823,0.97,5357.819,5358.453,Thank you.,181,,
824,0.97,5358.453,5363.624,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",182,,
825,0.97,5363.624,5383.878,"Councilmember Herbold, before I go back to you to close out debate, and having this conversation, there has been a few comments about how lowering the AMI from 80% to 60% AMI would require subsidy from the city.",182,,
826,0.97,5383.878,5397.391,"What is confusing to me about that statement is whether that means that if this amendment didn't pass, there wouldn't be a subsidy required, and I'm not sure that that's the case.",182,,
827,0.97,5397.391,5415.877,"Secondly, if it is the case that a subsidy would be required, do you think that your amendment has the impact of requiring a deeper subsidy from City resources in order to effectuate the intent, of more deeply affordable rental housing units?",182,,
828,0.97,5415.877,5424.285,The amendment itself has no impact on whether a subsidy is required.,183,,
829,0.97,5424.285,5436.898,The fact that nonprofit developers working with religious institutions to develop land on the property owned by religious institutions.,183,,
830,0.97,5436.898,5448.409,It's just a statement of fact that those nonprofit developers are likely to be getting funds from the city.,183,,
831,0.97,5448.409,5454.849,"As a requirement of those funds, they will very likely be maintaining units at 60%.",183,,
832,0.97,5454.849,5477.972,"So, this issue is being brought up to say that this amendment, my amendment, is unneeded because, as Councilmember Strauss has said, the majority of developers that would be working with religious institutions will be receiving a subsidy from the city and maintaining their rent at six percent AMI.",183,,
833,0.97,5477.972,5484.779,"So, that is a statement that is used to say that my name is unneeded.",183,,
834,0.97,5484.779,5504.298,"I believe my amendment is needed because I do not want to get conditions where for profit developers are in a position to basically pump out our nonprofit housing developers in a situation where a religious facility, a religious institution is choosing, between which developer to work with.",183,,
835,0.97,5504.298,5509.604,If they choose to work with the developer who does not intend to take city dollars.,183,,
836,0.97,5509.604,5532.426,"Does not intend to do Mission- based affordable housing development, the religious institution could then choose to work with the for profit developer at a greater financial returned to the religious institution, which I understand that is something that is desirable.",183,,
837,0.97,5532.426,5535.229,I'm just going to make these my closing comments if that's okay.,183,,
838,0.97,5535.229,5538.099,Answering your question I think is my closing comments.,183,,
839,0.97,5538.099,5540.434,"Sure, okay.",184,,
840,0.97,5540.434,5544.505,Reportedly the density bonus about doubles the land value.,185,,
841,0.97,5544.505,5551.612,"Religious institutions need to be, I think in exchange given a public benefit in exchange.",185,,
842,0.97,5551.612,5561.656,"As has been said before, 80% AMI rents are basically market rate rents.",185,,
843,0.97,5561.656,5567.962,"Just to say those numbers again, in case people didn't catch them when I said them the first time.",185,,
844,0.97,5567.962,5573.568,That's $1620 for a studio.,185,,
845,0.97,5573.568,5575.87,And that is $1851 for a one- bedroom apartment.,185,,
846,0.97,5575.87,5577.471,That is 80% AMI.,185,,
847,0.97,5577.471,5579.34,That is basically market.,185,,
848,0.97,5579.34,5601.562,"If you do accept the argument as Councilmember Sawant does not agree with the argument, but if you do accept the argument that building more supply of housing will drive the market down, then you are going to have a subsidy--and Insensate program where the ranch is actually higher than market.",185,,
849,0.97,5601.562,5604.799,"Again, there is no public value in that.",185,,
850,0.97,5604.799,5609.17,All right.,186,,
851,0.97,5609.17,5611.806,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold.",186,,
852,0.97,5611.806,5616.811,"For those answering my questions, and wrapping up debate on this one.",186,,
853,0.97,5616.811,5619.88,I appreciate it.,186,,
854,0.97,5619.88,5625.386,I think we have exhausted our conversation and debate on amendment 1B.,186,,
855,0.97,5625.386,5628.823,I am going to go ahead and call this one up for a vote now.,186,,
856,0.97,5628.823,5632.226,"So, will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of amendment 1B?",186,,
857,0.97,5632.226,5635.529,Mosqueda?,187,,

859,0.97,5643.337,5646.24,Yes.,189,,

877,0.97,5686.28,5690.651,"Councilmember Mosqueda, that was a Yes?",204,,
878,0.97,5690.651,5692.686,Is that correct?,204,,
879,0.97,5692.686,5695.556,"No, it was a no.",205,,
880,0.97,5695.556,5697.992,"Okay, thank you, just wanted to double check.",206,,
881,0.97,5697.992,5699.56,"Five in favor, three opposed.",206,,

885,0.97,5715.076,5718.579,I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Herbold to walk us through amendment two.,207,,
886,0.97,5718.579,5721.682,Thank you again.,208,,
887,0.97,5721.682,5726.387,Let me get over to my notes here.,208,,
888,0.97,5726.387,5730.024,I moved to amend Council bill 120081 as presented on the recently distributed amendment two.,208,,
889,0.97,5730.024,5734.328,Second.,209,,
890,0.97,5734.328,5738.833,It has been moved and Seconded to amend the bill as presented on amendment two.,210,,
891,0.97,5738.833,5741.735,I'm going to hand it back over to Councilmember Herbold to address her amendment.,210,,
892,0.97,5741.735,5743.637,"Thank you, so this is pretty straightforward.",211,,
893,0.97,5743.637,5751.245,This amendment would simply increase the term of Affordability to 75 years from 50 years.,211,,
894,0.97,5751.245,5763.057,"Really want to come in offering this amendment, uplift the leadership of former Councilmember Rob Johnson.",211,,
895,0.97,5763.057,5774.835,"I think he really with the Mha program did the city a great service in moving our Affordability requirements, the term of Affordability requirements, to a longer-term.",211,,
896,0.97,5774.835,5787.481,"I think that that is something we should endeavor to Replicate at any opportunity that we have so that again, the value of the public benefit is more sustaining.",211,,
897,0.97,5787.481,5789.55,Thank you.,211,,

901,0.97,5809.103,5810.805,"Oh, Councilmember Strauss, please.",212,,
902,0.97,5810.805,5817.578,Much like the last amendment I'm encouraging my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.,213,,
903,0.97,5817.578,5821.482,It came before the committee and did not receive enough support to pass on.,213,,
904,0.97,5821.482,5829.023,"This is all, Councilmember Herbold I appreciate you bringing about these amendments.",213,,
905,0.97,5829.023,5832.126,These were both amendments we had long conversations about in committee.,213,,
906,0.97,5832.126,5845.806,It is still my desire to see this program work at it has been written out for a period of a year.,213,,
907,0.97,5845.806,5851.011,"I understand that it is your desire, and I appreciate you bringing forward a better amendment for that last one than what was originally put forward.",213,,
908,0.97,5851.011,5851.745,I do appreciate that.,213,,
909,0.97,5851.745,5865.125,"Again, there is confusion within the community about the length of time this amendment adds more confusion than clarity with some of these projects that are currently on their way to being built.",213,,
910,0.97,5865.125,5872.266,"So again, I'm not seeing a one- year delay in this amendment.",213,,
911,0.97,5872.266,5875.169,Can you confirm that at this time?,213,,
912,0.97,5875.169,5877.538,"This would go into effect today, is that correct?",213,,
913,0.97,5877.538,5885.779,"It would go into effect with the passage and signing and normal 30 day period, yes.",214,,
914,0.97,5885.779,5893.354,"You are right, there is no phased implementation.",214,,
915,0.97,5893.354,5903.097,"Even more so, I think that through the process of these amendments over the last 10 days, we have not had a Chesive Stakeholder in process with the amendment sponsors.",215,,
916,0.97,5903.097,5904.965,And the Stakeholders.,215,,
917,0.97,5904.965,5918.879,"So, the builders and the owners, this is an amendment that without the year delay poses risks to projects currently desiring to use the legislation as written by the state.",215,,
918,0.97,5918.879,5927.421,"So, strong, strongly encouraging colleagues to put down this amendment.",215,,
919,0.97,5927.421,5933.227,Happy to bring all of this backup in a year or in six months when we have more data about whether or not this program is being utilized.,215,,
920,0.97,5933.227,5935.496,Is being utilized as intended and if it needs to change.,215,,
921,0.97,5935.496,5941.435,"Not opposed to the intent, and very supportive of the intent, I'm not supporting this amendment at this time.",215,,
922,0.97,5941.435,5943.237,I remain open to future conversations regarding this.,215,,
