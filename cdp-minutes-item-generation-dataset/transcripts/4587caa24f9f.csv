21,0.97,47.514,60.794,"We are still waiting for our last two Councilmembers to join us, but we will go ahead and dig in and Admonish them Accordingly, Colleen.",17,,
22,0.97,60.794,61.194,Just kidding.,17,,
23,0.97,61.194,63.897,"Presentations, I am not aware of any presentations.",17,,
24,0.97,63.897,71.204,"Approval of the minutes of the city council meeting June 1,2020 have been reviewed.",17,,
25,0.97,71.204,74.407,"Hearing no objection, the minutes are being signed.",17,,
26,0.97,74.407,78.511,Will the clerk please affix my signature to the now approved minutes.,17,,
27,0.97,78.511,89.722,"Okay, folks, we are going to do adoption of the referral calendar just for the benefit of us as colleagues and for those people listening in.",17,,
28,0.97,89.722,98.331,We have some procedural steps that we got to go through in order to adopt the referral calendar.,17,,
29,0.97,98.331,113.713,So there will be an amendment that will need to be made by Councilmember Herbold and then there will be an amendment that will lead to be advanced by Councilmember Sawant.,17,,
30,0.97,113.713,114.18,And Council briefing.,17,,
31,0.97,114.18,119.619,"Now, I still don't think we have Councilmember Herbold on the line, Oh, there she is.",17,,
32,0.97,119.619,122.856,She just--looks like she is on with us now.,17,,
33,0.97,122.856,128.394,So I am going to go ahead and make sure that we can move through this as quickly as possible.,17,,
34,0.97,128.394,135.101,"So again, right now what we are going to consider is a couple of motions, one from Councilmember Herbold.",17,,
35,0.97,135.101,144.41,The other will come from Councilmember Sawant for the sole purpose of amending the proposed and introduction and referral calendar.,17,,
36,0.97,144.41,146.579,So bear with us for those of you listening in.,17,,
37,0.97,146.579,153.753,We're going to try to move through this as quickly as possible so we can get to public comment.,17,,
38,0.97,153.753,158.825,"I will move to adopt the referral calendar, is there a Snekd.",17,,
39,0.97,158.825,159.359,Second.,18,,
40,0.97,159.359,162.862,It has been moved and Seconded.,19,,
41,0.97,162.862,173.206,"Councilmember Herbold, I understand that you are prepared to make your motion at this time, so if you are on the line, I will yield the floor to you for that amendment.",19,,
42,0.97,173.206,174.374,Thank you.,20,,
43,0.97,174.374,207.273,"I move to amend the introduction referral calendar by Introdeucing Council bill 119803 entitled an ordinance requiring that certain uniformed police officers do not cover with a mourning band the serial number that is engraved on their badge, amending section 3.28.130 of the Seattle municipal code, declaring an emergency and establishing an immediate effective date all by a three-fourths vote of the city Council and by referring it to the city council.",20,,
44,0.97,207.273,209.242,Is there a second?,21,,
45,0.97,209.242,209.742,Second.,22,,
46,0.97,209.742,210.009,Second.,23,,
47,0.97,210.009,210.276,Great.,24,,
48,0.97,210.276,216.516,It has been moved and Seconded to amend the introduction and referral calendar.,24,,
49,0.97,216.516,227.393,"Councilmember Herbold, do you have any brief remarks on this amendment before we open it up for additional potential comment and then ultimately a role call.",24,,
50,0.97,227.393,227.994,Thank you.,25,,
51,0.97,227.994,248.848,"Here in Seattle, people that have participated in the recent rallies and demonstrations protesting the killing of George Floyd have indicated that they have often been unable to identify officers because they could not see a name tag and that the officer's badge serial number was covered with a mourning band.",25,,
52,0.97,248.848,256.356,This legislation would allow the continued use of mourning bands as long as they do not obscure the officer's badge number.,25,,
53,0.97,256.356,266.833,This NOTE assumes that officers would continue to use the badges that they have already been issued by SPD but would simply move the mourning band away from the serial number.,25,,
54,0.97,266.833,271.07,Early last week I announced my intent to introduce this legislation.,25,,
55,0.97,271.07,275.041,"Subsequent to that, the police chief ordered officers to display badge numbers.",25,,
56,0.97,275.041,287.553,I appreciate her order but want to Enshrine this to city law so that it does not depend on the policy of this chief or a future chief.,25,,
57,0.97,287.553,296.896,This bill builds off of legislation adopted in 2000 after the WTO protests which required the display of names on uniforms.,25,,
58,0.97,296.896,301.434,This bill was sponsored by former Councilmember Steinbrook and this is an appropriate role for the Council.,25,,
59,0.97,301.434,308.408,And I'm hoping that a vote can be held on this legislation next Monday at full council.,25,,
60,0.97,308.408,311.844,"Thank you for those brief remarks, Councilmember Herbold.",26,,
61,0.97,311.844,321.421,Are there any other comments on the proposed amendment to the introduction and referral calendar?,26,,
62,0.97,321.421,332.899,"Hearing none, I would just add that Councilmember Herbold, this is not untraditional for us to pursue the strategy that you've just described.",26,,
63,0.97,332.899,360.026,"We did it in the context, if you recall, around observer, like an observer bill of rights, which was usually policies that were memorialized in directives that you wisely put forward and legislated so that if the directive changes, you know, we have to be notified of that because there is an ordinance and a law in place that exists.",26,,
64,0.97,360.026,366.032,And that would preempt the directive that lives in the discretion of the Department.,26,,
65,0.97,366.032,379.512,And we also did the same thing as it related to the Bias-Free policing ordinance that I cosponsored with then Council President Bruce Harrell.,26,,
66,0.97,379.512,395.928,"The Seattle police Department has a Bias-Free policing policy in their standard operating procedural manual, but we felt it was important to Memorialize that in ordinance and in law.",26,,
67,0.97,395.928,403.336,"So appreciate you, nonetheless, bringing--even though there was a directive by the chief, I appreciate you bringing this opportunity forward to Memorialize it in code.",26,,
68,0.97,403.336,406.572,I think it's a prudent path to take.,26,,
69,0.97,406.572,417.75,"Okay, if there are no other comments on the amendment, seeing none I would ask the clerk call the roll.",26,,
70,0.97,417.75,418.05,Mosqueda?,27,,
71,0.97,418.05,421.821,Aye.,28,,

86,0.97,439.939,440.406,President Gonzalez?,43,,
87,0.97,440.406,440.74,Aye.,44,,
88,0.97,440.74,442.642,"Nine in favor, none opposed.",45,,
89,0.97,442.642,449.348,The motion carries and the bill is added to the introduction and referral calendar.,46,,
90,0.97,449.348,464.063,I'm now going to move over to Councilmember Sawant who I understand has two proposed bills that she would like to move for introduction and referral to the city council that is not on the published introduction and referral calendar.,46,,
91,0.97,464.063,468.468,These bills were also not distributed by the 5:00 P.M.,46,,
92,0.97,468.468,496.262,"Deadline this past Friday as required by the Council rules, so before Councilmember Sawant makes her substantive motions, we have to take one quick little administrative procedural step, which is we have to suspend the rules to allow for Councilmember Sawant to make her motions to amend the introduction and referral calendar.",46,,
93,0.97,496.262,510.61,"So if there is no objection, the Council rule will be suspended to allow consideration of a bill for introduction and referral that was not distributed by 5:00 P.M.",46,,
94,0.97,510.61,511.878,On Friday.,46,,
95,0.97,511.878,512.945,Is there any objection?,46,,
96,0.97,512.945,525.424,"Hearing no objection, the Council rule is suspended and Councilmember Sawant is now going to proceed with proposing an amendment to the introduction and referral calendar.",46,,
97,0.97,525.424,528.661,"Councilmember Sawant, the floor is yours.",46,,
98,0.97,528.661,531.163,"Thank you, president Gonzalez.",47,,
99,0.97,531.163,536.836,I move to amend the calendar to introduce 119804 and 119805.,47,,

110,0.97,612.011,620.82,Seattle police are attacking peaceful Protester daily from young children to the elderly with Chemical weapons that are internationally banned in warfare.,50,,
111,0.97,620.82,625.057,"They have used Chokeholds on protesters, including the same kind of Chokehold that killed George Floyd.",50,,
112,0.97,625.057,632.565,Last night I was part of a group of hundreds of activists protesting peacefully on Capitol Hill at 11th and pine.,50,,
113,0.97,632.565,637.77,We were Maced and gassed by Seattle police with no provocation.,50,,
114,0.97,637.77,642.875,The police had many officers fully donned in riot gear.,50,,
115,0.97,642.875,646.979,"They had pads protecting their shoulders, arms and Shins.",50,,
116,0.97,646.979,653.853,"They had on Bullet-Proof vests, face shields, body shields, gas masks and they carried Batons, rifles and chemical weapons.",50,,

118,0.97,665.231,669.402,The police have come prepared to inflict violence without provocation.,50,,
119,0.97,669.402,672.905,Last Friday my office distributed drafts of these two bills to Council offices.,50,,
120,0.97,672.905,687.887,"The first bill bans the city from owning and the police from using crowd control weapons like tear gas, Mace, gas Bams, flash bangs and other weapons that are used Indiscriminately on gatherings of protesters.",50,,
121,0.97,687.887,700.766,"Some of these weapons, like tear gas, are banned from use in war by the Geneva convention, yet the Mayor and the Seattle police under her control have repeatedly on a daily basis used them on the people of Seattle.",50,,
122,0.97,700.766,712.578,I've heard reports from many community members as have other Councilmembers outraged that these weapons were even used against the protests.,50,,

129,0.97,757.056,763.629,The second bill bans the use of Chokeholds by the Seattle police Department.,50,,

295,0.97,1317.683,1329.795,At this time we are going to open up the remote public comment period for items on the city council agenda introduction and referral calendar and the Council's 2020 work program.,162,,
296,0.97,1329.795,1346.945,"I ask that everyone be patient with us as we continue to learn and operate this new system, even after a few weeks of putting it into practice, we still some little hiccups.",162,,
297,0.97,1346.945,1354.519,"So I appreciate you all, colleagues, and your patience and those on the listening line waiting to provide public testimony.",162,,
298,0.97,1354.519,1355.387,Appreciate your ongoing patience.,162,,
299,0.97,1355.387,1367.566,"Of course, we're always looking at ways to fine tune this process, and continuously looking to add new features to allow for additional means of public participation.",162,,
300,0.97,1367.566,1389.921,"It does remain our strong intent to have public comment regularly included on meeting Agendas, but, of course, we will continue to reserve the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem the system is being abused and in a manner in which we can conduct business.",162,,
301,0.97,1389.921,1394.793,I'm going to moderate the period in the following manner.,162,,
302,0.97,1394.793,1399.564,The public comment period is 20 minutes.,162,,
303,0.97,1399.564,1434.399,"However, colleagues, we have I think at last count about 140 folks present and available to provide public testimony at today's meeting, so while we ordinarily give each Speaker two minutes, I have proposed that we do one minute per Speaker and that we allow public comment for 60 minutes in today's public comment period.",162,,
304,0.97,1434.399,1447.979,I did hear from one Councilmember that they'd like to stick with the two minutes and allow for every Speaker to be able to speak.,162,,
305,0.97,1447.979,1472.704,"I do appreciate that advocacy, but I really do, you know, feel that it's important for us to get to the other items of important business on the agenda as well and I think to get through 140 people if we did it at two minutes, that is--would put us well over two hours in public comment alone.",162,,
306,0.97,1472.704,1486.384,I do want to acknowledge that most of the speakers that have signed in to speak today are specifically about the ongoing policing issues that we have continued to speak about.,162,,
307,0.97,1486.384,1507.005,"You know, we will be able to have an opportunity to have a very long and fully dedicated session to public comment through Councilmember Herbold's Commttee, public services and safety Committee in the future, so this will not be the only opportunity people have to address the full council.",162,,
308,0.97,1507.005,1532.797,"So again, colleagues, I'm going to stick with the earlier communication that I provided to you all that my intention is to allow public comment today for 60 minutes and to allow each Speaker to have one minute of time to address the Council with the purpose and intent of trying to hear from as many people who Preregistered today.",162,,
309,0.97,1532.797,1543.208,"So with that being said, I'm going to call again for those listening, I'm going to call on each Speaker by name and in the order in which they registered.",162,,
310,0.97,1543.208,1554.586,"If you have not registered to speak yet but want to, you can do so by going to the Council's Website at Seattle.Gov/Council.",162,,
311,0.97,1554.586,1560.225,The public comment link is also listed on today's agenda for ease of reference.,162,,
312,0.97,1560.225,1571.67,"Once I call a Speaker's name, staff will Unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt of you have been Unmuted will be the Speaker's Cue it is their turn to speak.",162,,
313,0.97,1571.67,1577.742,I ask that each Speaker begin by stating their name and the item that they are addressing.,162,,
314,0.97,1577.742,1587.352,"As a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction referral calendar or the Council's 2020 work program.",162,,
315,0.97,1587.352,1599.965,"Speakers are going to hear a little Chime around ten second, and that Chime means that you have exactly ten seconds left of your time and once you hear that time, we ask you begin the process of wrapping up your public comment.",162,,
316,0.97,1599.965,1609.207,"For speakers who do not end their comments at the end of the one minute, the Speaker's microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next Speaker.",162,,
317,0.97,1609.207,1623.822,"Once you've completed your public comment, I would ask that you please Disconnect from the line, and if you plan to continue following this meeting, I ask you do so via Seattle channel at Seattlechannel.Org or on channel 21 on TV.",162,,
318,0.97,1623.822,1629.627,You can also use any one of the listening options listed on the agenda.,162,,
319,0.97,1629.627,1643.241,"And for those folks who are signed up for public comment, if we don't get to you, you can still submit public comment to us via Email at Council @ Seattle.Gov.",162,,
320,0.97,1643.241,1667.732,"Again, many of us, as I mentioned during Council briefing, our voicemail is completely full and many of us are working through dealing with that in our individual offices, so Emailing us is by far the fastest and best way to submit to us any public comment you have on any issues related to Council business.",162,,
321,0.97,1667.732,1675.106,"With that being said, the public comment Speeder now going to be open and we will begin with the first Speaker on the list.",162,,
322,0.97,1675.106,1677.976,"Again, it is--it's about 2:30 P.M.",162,,
323,0.97,1677.976,1679.944,I'm going to say it's 2:30 P.M.,162,,
324,0.97,1679.944,1684.883,And say that we will take public comment until 3:30 P.M.,162,,
325,0.97,1684.883,1691.89,"So that being said, I am going to go ahead and call on the first speaker.",162,,

330,0.97,1707.272,1714.679,Our community strongly supports the black lives matter movement and is opposed to the Militarization and violent techniques used by the Seattle police Department.,163,,
331,0.97,1714.679,1723.621,What we have witnessed in Seattle in the past week and what the black community continues to face is state-sponsored terrorism.,163,,
332,0.97,1723.621,1734.632,"The city council must work with the Prosecutor's office to press terrorism charges against Mayor Durkan, police chief best and the officers who were involved in the violent incidents.",163,,
333,0.97,1734.632,1747.445,"You must move immediately to Defund the police Department entirely, work on Community-Based safety programs and provide Reparative justice for all the innocent people and families that have been destroyed by such acts.",163,,

339,0.97,1765.23,1772.77,"We know a Seattle officer was the one who fired the shot that killed Sean, but who were the accomplices in his murder?",165,,
340,0.97,1772.77,1785.45,"The Seattle police may have hunted Sean like an animal, but Mayor Jenny Durkan pulled the trigger, so why, Mayor, was Sean killed with a Silencer while he was holding his own baby child?",165,,
341,0.97,1785.45,1792.69,"Why, Mayor, was that baby child covered in the blood of its own parent?",165,,
342,0.97,1792.69,1804.769,"Only a Morley bankrupt administration would pay a Lyft service to the murder of George Floyd, a man killed by police over 1,600 miles away, while remaining silent on police murders right here at home.",165,,
343,0.97,1804.769,1815.747,Only the failed Idealogy of the White establishment would invest in a Militarized police to the tune of $400 million rather than the economic prosperity that would have prevented this dry Sis in the first place.,165,,
344,0.97,1815.747,1822.287,"Next to Donald Trump, Mayor Durkan looks like a progressive hero, but the reality is, Jenny Durkan is a fraud.",165,,
345,0.97,1822.287,1833.631,The best way to De-Escalate the city is for Mayor Durkan to resign or be removed from office.,165,,
346,0.97,1833.631,1838.703,Our next Speaker is Mari Delaney followed by Steven Ramos.,166,,
347,0.97,1838.703,1840.371,"Hi there, I am Mari Delaney.",167,,

408,0.97,2220.685,2233.731,"I think it's time to focus on the things that are working, this is one of them, to let a little bit more opportunity to focus on the things that clearly aren't working and it's clogged the rules today.",177,,

419,0.97,2279.243,2281.612,"I have never, even during WTO, seen anything like this.",179,,
420,0.97,2281.612,2292.923,20 years ago we had an after report from WTO that told us exactly what we needed to do to police demonstrations and we failed to take any of those lessons into account.,179,,
421,0.97,2292.923,2306.037,"Lastly, it's only been ten days that these demonstrations have been happening and about 11, 12, 13 days ago, this city Council and the Mayor were proclaiming what wonderful progress we had made in policing.",179,,

438,0.97,2372.97,2377.475,We are led by the neighborhood for the neighborhood and we know our neighborhood.,181,,
439,0.97,2377.475,2387.218,This amendment takes away the community's authority to govern itself at a time when continuity of programs is critical to our small businesses if they're going to survive.,181,,
440,0.97,2387.218,2391.655,Lit waste precious resources that could be spent on programs.,181,,

448,0.97,2419.416,2429.727,Jenny Durkan was allowing police officers to do that and she is not holding them to account.,183,,
449,0.97,2429.727,2438.035,"Defunding $100 million from the police Department is extremely possible and with smart leadership, I would even volunteer my services as a business professional to do it.",183,,
450,0.97,2438.035,2447.478,Subjecting the uniformed and civilian members of the police Department to the same uncertainty of Playoffs and Furloughs as the rest of the city is only fair and reflective of the ongoing times.,183,,
451,0.97,2447.478,2450.915,And they should not be immune to the economic impacts.,183,,
452,0.97,2450.915,2454.885,"Change cannot happen with the current leadership, all rising through the ranks of the Seattle police Department.",183,,
453,0.97,2454.885,2464.829,"And with member of the command staff having 20 years or more with the SPD, it's hard to have any impact when your career is all in one place.",183,,

461,0.97,2488.853,2491.622,I have experienced a shared trauma with my neighbors.,185,,
462,0.97,2491.622,2499.73,The Mayor and police captain have only made this problem worse by trying to Placate crowds with meaningless words and broken promises.,185,,
463,0.97,2499.73,2504.935,I have seen umbrellas classified as weapons and used as a reason to protect public safety by gassing and Macing the crowds.,185,,
464,0.97,2504.935,2512.91,I have seen the police react to individuals Throwig water bottles and pushing flimsy barricades with violence against the entire crowd.,185,,

475,0.97,2636.934,2644.875,Last night the incident that the Councilmember brought up potentially cost the life of someone being treated in that station at the moment.,189,,
476,0.97,2644.875,2649.78,That is a direct result of police aggression and is not a moral issue.,189,,
477,0.97,2649.78,2652.65,It is not an issue of judgement.,189,,
478,0.97,2652.65,2655.219,Those places are clearly marked.,189,,
479,0.97,2655.219,2657.421,It's not a decision to make.,189,,
480,0.97,2657.421,2667.364,"You don't touch those, that is specifically stated under Geneva conventions and any sort of action to the difference of that is just deplorable and disgusting.",189,,
481,0.97,2667.364,2671.935,So I'd implore the city Council to take any action they can to reconcile that as soon as you can.,189,,

595,0.97,3223.153,3239.402,"Therefore our demand is that the chief of police, chief best and the prosecuting attorney office go back and look at every case where it consists of murder where a citizen was murdered by the Seattle police officer.",205,,
596,0.97,3239.402,3255.652,Those could be Revisited and Re-Opened to see whether or not those officers who commit such conduct as relate to those citizen's lives and see if there's possible charges against them for what they have done to those citizens by taking their life.,205,,

602,0.97,3297.661,3298.995,It's atrocious.,207,,
603,0.97,3298.995,3308.371,It's atrocious on top of all things the police departments across the country have done causing violent deaths of black people in particular.,207,,
604,0.97,3308.371,3315.345,But this also affects the whole community and basically I feel the police Department needs to be dissolved.,207,,

837,0.97,4699.961,4713.608,"I believe that by failing to protect the residents of Seattle and--from their physical safety and constitutional rights, Mayor Durkan has willfully violated her duty.",245,,
838,0.97,4713.608,4730.325,"And her constant lying about tear gas use, encouraging them to go to protests and saying they won't be attacked by chemical weapons is moral ineptitude.",245,,

841,0.97,4737.833,4750.712,I support the renewal of the U district Bia but not the amendments which are unreasonable and not required of other bias in the city.,247,,
842,0.97,4750.712,4756.651,The 12-year Timeframe is what Petitioners want and is comparable to other Bia.,247,,
843,0.97,4756.651,4762.657,Requiring an Rsq is unnecessary because this oversight is already a responsibility of the rate payer board.,247,,
844,0.97,4762.657,4774.469,Both provisions would require the rate payer board and the city to spend precious time and money on processes that aren't needed and could instead be directed toward the needs of the neighborhood where they will have a greater impact.,247,,
845,0.97,4774.469,4777.973,The Bia has made a significant difference here.,247,,

857,0.97,4826.254,4829.357,This glorifies violence over the public interest.,249,,
858,0.97,4829.357,4832.828,Who knows how long we will continue to be so lucky.,249,,
859,0.97,4832.828,4833.929,I urge you to act.,249,,

872,0.97,4910.939,4911.74,She must resign immediately.,251,,
873,0.97,4911.74,4915.977,"If not, I ask the city Council to proceed with impeachment hearings.",251,,
874,0.97,4915.977,4925.053,"To perform at the bare minimum of your position, you must outlaw the ownership and use of crowd control weapons, chemical weapons and deadly force by the police.",251,,

890,0.97,5029.691,5037.832,It was acknowledged earlier by members of this city council that in the past police reform has failed to generate substantial change here in Seattle and all around the country.,255,,
891,0.97,5037.832,5047.108,Why should we believe that any efforts to reform will bring about any change here and now when we cannot even hold SPD accountable to a tear gas ban for 48 hours.,255,,

1031,0.97,5782.743,5783.944,I will be brief.,299,,
1032,0.97,5783.944,5791.986,"Just by way of background, colleagues, as I mentioned several weeks ago, we have the U district Bia before us.",299,,
1033,0.97,5791.986,5801.328,The community economic development committee met on May 20th for an initial briefing and discussion of the bill which would establish a new Bia.,299,,
1034,0.97,5801.328,5811.839,Proponents of the new Bia as well as central staff and the office of economic development presented to the committee to describe the background and intent of the proposal.,299,,
1035,0.97,5811.839,5820.314,The legislation as transmitted does include a couple of changes to the way the Bia is structured.,299,,
1036,0.97,5820.314,5828.055,It would have two additional business tenants who have leases as Councilmember Pedersen mentioned earlier.,299,,
1037,0.97,5828.055,5832.526,"So tenants who pay taxes, insurance and maintenance.",299,,
1038,0.97,5832.526,5834.295,It would add one residential representative.,299,,
1039,0.97,5834.295,5842.169,"I know we got an Email recently asking about that, so there is one residential representative in the new structure.",299,,
1040,0.97,5842.169,5854.882,"On May 27th, the committee held the required public hearing to discuss proposed amendments and then we had planned to vote on those amendments in committee this week.",299,,
1041,0.97,5854.882,5863.891,"Obviously, because we have shifted things for the budget discussions to begin, we are now considering amendments today.",299,,
1042,0.97,5863.891,5870.898,So we have talked about this a little bit in briefing this morning.,299,,
1043,0.97,5870.898,5878.239,I will just give a quick summary of the amendments and then hand it back to the Council President.,299,,
1044,0.97,5878.239,5889.884,Amendment one is technical corrections and Clarifications with the addition of holding the Uw at its current number of five seats on the Advisory board.,299,,
1045,0.97,5889.884,5896.257,"It shifts contracting responsibility, which is an administrative change, from FAS to Obd.",299,,
1046,0.97,5896.257,5904.798,"They have agreed to this, and that was adopted in the Bia policies in 2016.",299,,
1047,0.97,5904.798,5911.872,Amendment two is the--Shortens the term of the Bia itself from 12 years to 10.,299,,
1048,0.97,5911.872,5918.279,And the interim program manager from five years to one year.,299,,
1049,0.97,5918.279,5938.299,"As I said earlier this morning, the rational for shortening the program manager contract is that other groups need the opportunity to bid, but as I said before, to my mind there's already a competitive bid process that anybody who is interested could engage in.",299,,
1050,0.97,5938.299,5947.541,"And if this passes, Oed would have to bid out starting in a year.",299,,
1051,0.97,5947.541,5956.784,"And in my mind, there isn't a clear rationale for shortening the Bia term by two years.",299,,
1052,0.97,5956.784,5965.826,"So I will leave it there, and turn it back to you, Council President.",299,,
1053,0.97,5965.826,5966.093,Great.,300,,
1054,0.97,5966.093,5966.794,Thank you so much.,300,,

1056,0.97,5975.869,5979.239,So this is what we're going to do.,300,,
1057,0.97,5979.239,5984.144,"I appreciate Councilmember Morales, you addressing the underlying bill.",300,,
1058,0.97,5984.144,5993.954,"I know, again, that Councilmember Pedersen discussed this morning he has a couple amendments, so we're going to go through the process of that Amendatory work.",300,,
1059,0.97,5993.954,6001.462,"So I believe there are a total of--let's see here, two amendments, both by Councilmember Pedersen.",300,,
1060,0.97,6001.462,6008.168,So I'm going to go ahead and hand it over to Councilmember Pedersen to walk us through those amendments.,300,,
1061,0.97,6008.168,6014.375,And my request would be that we take them one at a time.,300,,
1062,0.97,6014.375,6020.414,So let's do amendment one and then we will have consideration and debate on amendment one.,300,,
1063,0.97,6020.414,6023.25,And then we will consider amendment two.,300,,
1064,0.97,6023.25,6025.719,"Councilmember Pedersen, the floor is yours.",300,,
1065,0.97,6025.719,6028.155,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez.",301,,
1066,0.97,6028.155,6034.328,And thanks again to chair Morales who accurately and fairly describes the underlying legislation.,301,,
1067,0.97,6034.328,6037.398,I really appreciate the collaboration with her throughout this process.,301,,
1068,0.97,6037.398,6049.009,Úand I appreciate the patience f my colleagues as we take a pause from the crises going around us here to renew or reauthorize this business improvement area.,301,,
1069,0.97,6049.009,6054.047,"There are ten throughout the city, this is one of them in the University district.",301,,
1070,0.97,6054.047,6074.334,"Just to move the process along here, since we did discuss it at length this morning, I'd like to move to amend Council bill 119779 by substituting version 2B for version 1F as presented on amendment on today's agenda.",301,,
1071,0.97,6074.334,6074.601,Second.,302,,
1072,0.97,6074.601,6075.769,Thank you.,303,,
1073,0.97,6075.769,6081.175,It's been moved and Seconded so the motion is properly before us.,304,,
1074,0.97,6081.175,6086.847,So Councilmember Pedersen the floor is yours to address amendment one.,304,,
1075,0.97,6086.847,6087.981,Thank you.,305,,
1076,0.97,6087.981,6093.02,So this is full of technical corrections.,305,,
1077,0.97,6093.02,6101.628,"For example, changing the administrator from director of FAS to the director of office of economic development.",305,,
1078,0.97,6101.628,6118.645,It does have the noncontroversial amendment in there about Solidifying the existing membership of the University of Washington at five members.,305,,
1079,0.97,6118.645,6123.484,And so Yolanda went through this this morning.,305,,
1080,0.97,6123.484,6126.286,The second amendment is where it gets more complex.,305,,
1081,0.97,6126.286,6129.49,This is the substitute with the technical corrections.,305,,
1082,0.97,6129.49,6132.025,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Pedersen.",306,,
1083,0.97,6132.025,6145.672,I was Chuckling at your Eference to thinking that ts morning was yesterday which seems appropriate for this day and age in terms of how quickly time seems to fly beyond us.,306,,
1084,0.97,6145.672,6152.012,"So colleagues, any questions or comments on the proposed substitute?",306,,
1085,0.97,6152.012,6153.547,"Councilmember Lewis, the floor is yours.",306,,
1086,0.97,6153.547,6156.683,"Thank you so much, Madame President.",307,,

1089,0.97,6170.931,6180.674,"Without any hesitation, I'll say on the matter of adopting 2B or not 2B I side on voting yes for substitute 2B.",307,,
1090,0.97,6180.674,6184.111,So thank you so much.,307,,
1091,0.97,6184.111,6184.378,Great.,308,,

1094,0.97,6191.118,6191.318,Okay.,308,,

1113,0.97,6229.122,6234.661,"The motion carries, and version 2 B of the bill is before the city council.",326,,
1114,0.97,6234.661,6235.629,I understand there is another amendment.,326,,
1115,0.97,6235.629,6242.069,"This is amendment two which is, I think, described as a little Trickier by Councilmember Pedersen.",326,,
1116,0.97,6242.069,6249.509,And so we will now hear from Councilmember Pedersen as he formally moves consideration of amendment two.,326,,
1117,0.97,6249.509,6250.911,"Thank you, Council President.",327,,
1118,0.97,6250.911,6260.821,I move to amend Council bill 119779 adds presented on amendment two on the agenda.,327,,
1119,0.97,6260.821,6263.657,Is there a second?,328,,
1120,0.97,6263.657,6264.024,Second.,329,,
1121,0.97,6264.024,6272.099,"Okay, it's been moved and Seconded to consider amendment two.",330,,
1122,0.97,6272.099,6278.505,"And Councilmember Cleeder Sen, I'll hand it back over to you to address the proposed amendment.",330,,
1123,0.97,6278.505,6278.972,Thank you.,331,,
1124,0.97,6278.972,6292.686,"And again, I want to echo the comments of Councilmember Morales in terms of, you know, what the status quo has been over the last five years with the business improvement area in the University district.",331,,
1125,0.97,6292.686,6307.034,The legislation that was developed did have Stakeholder engagement and so there are already very important improvements in what we're voting on today.,331,,
1126,0.97,6307.034,6314.374,So the bill and the substitute adds a prevention of economic Displacements as part of the mission of the Bia.,331,,
1127,0.97,6314.374,6326.72,That is new and important considering the rapid changes that have been going on in the University district to prevent displacement as part of the Bia's mission.,331,,
1128,0.97,6326.72,6341.535,It also Reinstitutes term limits on the members of the rate payer advisory board and has a few other improvements as well to what the existing situation is.,331,,
1129,0.97,6341.535,6350.41,"One of the changes, though, is that it moves from the five-year Bia to a 12-year Bia.",331,,
1130,0.97,6350.41,6354.147,And the bias across the city have different lengths.,331,,
1131,0.97,6354.147,6364.925,"The 12-year Bia did raise--by more than doubling it, it raised some concerns from some small business owners who wanted to not see it more than doubled.",331,,
1132,0.97,6364.925,6374.267,So there is no magic to going--my proposal to go from ten to 12 years.,331,,
1133,0.97,6374.267,6375.235,It's just we're doubling it.,331,,
1134,0.97,6375.235,6388.381,It's some of the small businesses had wanted to reauthorize at only five years or seven years so the ten-year was--I was viewing that as a compromise.,331,,
1135,0.97,6388.381,6404.097,The other issue is how the program manager is selected to operate the clean and safety programs and economic development programs and prevention of displacement programs of the Bia.,331,,
1136,0.97,6404.097,6414.841,Currently the rate payer advisory board looks at that every year and decides who that is.,331,,
1137,0.97,6414.841,6419.279,This would open up the process--for the competitive process.,331,,
1138,0.97,6419.279,6420.38,It's a $1 million contract.,331,,
1139,0.97,6420.38,6437.097,I think there's agreement in general that competition can bring a healthy outcome and gets more Stakeholders in community driven organizations to get involved in potentially managing the Bia.,331,,
1140,0.97,6437.097,6442.736,The request for proposal is a very thorough process.,331,,
1141,0.97,6442.736,6443.804,It can become time consuming.,331,,
1142,0.97,6443.804,6460.22,"So just in the last week, I changed this concept so that to start this in the first year, this Competitie process, what this amendment is is to speed it up and start it sooner with only one year.",331,,
1143,0.97,6460.22,6466.326,To change it from an Rfp to an Rfq.,331,,
1144,0.97,6466.326,6477.07,"I've amended my amendment, it's before you, as a request for qualifications in that first year so that the office of economic development can do it in a more streamlined fashion.",331,,
1145,0.97,6477.07,6486.279,"There were concerns raised during public comment that, you know, even that is not what's wanted by a lot of folks out there.",331,,
1146,0.97,6486.279,6497.691,"So--but I believe that having this competitive process, have it be giving the ability to Community-Based organizations to compete for that.",331,,
1147,0.97,6497.691,6508.068,"This amendment combines those two things going from a 12-year to 10-year, and also having an Rfq process in year one.",331,,
1148,0.97,6508.068,6509.736,Happy to answer questions.,331,,
1149,0.97,6509.736,6510.971,Thank you so much.,332,,
1150,0.97,6510.971,6520.113,"Colleagues, are there any comments or questions on amendment two?",332,,
1151,0.97,6520.113,6523.316,Okay.,332,,
1152,0.97,6523.316,6535.829,"I'm not seeing or hearing anyone with any questions, Oh, Councilmember Sawant, please.",332,,
1153,0.97,6535.829,6540.667,"Looks like you're still on mute, Councilmember Sawant.",332,,
1154,0.97,6540.667,6546.439,I want to say I'm planning on voting yes on this amendment.,333,,
1155,0.97,6546.439,6550.176,"Councilmember, Herbold, we can hear your conversation in the background.",334,,
1156,0.97,6550.176,6550.477,Thank you.,334,,
1157,0.97,6550.477,6552.145,"Go ahead, Councilmember Sawant.",334,,
1158,0.97,6552.145,6552.612,Thank you.,335,,
1159,0.97,6552.612,6555.015,I'm planning on voting yes on this amendment.,335,,
1160,0.97,6555.015,6560.086,"You know, the thing is, the business improvement areas are a strange structure in Seattle.",335,,
1161,0.97,6560.086,6573.3,They are funded by property taxes only paid by commercial property and then the so-called democracy of the Bia gives the commercial property owners a vote roughly proportion Nal to the amount of property that they own.,335,,
1162,0.97,6573.3,6576.77,"So the more you own, the more votes you get.",335,,
1163,0.97,6576.77,6585.612,So it is reasonable that small businesses who have no meaningful say in the operations of the Bia would ask for changes in things like time limits.,335,,
1164,0.97,6585.612,6598.792,"My office is not convinced in amendment will make a substantive difference, but I will support the request by the smaller businesses and the Bia and vote yes on it.",335,,
1165,0.97,6598.792,6604.664,Any other questions or comments?,336,,
1166,0.97,6604.664,6605.165,Councilmember Mosqueda?,336,,
1167,0.97,6605.165,6605.498,Thank you.,337,,
1168,0.97,6605.498,6619.179,"Councilmember Pedersen, I want to thank you for walking through with our staff, with my staff, the response to the questions that I sent and Councilmember Morales, I was wondering if you had additional thoughts about this amendment as well.",337,,
1169,0.97,6619.179,6630.89,"At this point, we've heard concerns from community members with initiating an Rfq process one year after Bia authorization instead of five years, which is included in the base legislation.",337,,
1170,0.97,6630.89,6648.742,"I fully support the supplemental efforts that have been put forward, but these concerns center around the critical need to have folks on the ground to support small businesses and trying to weather the impacts of Covid, especially women and minority owned businesses in the neighborhood.",337,,
1171,0.97,6648.742,6660.253,"So in addition, there's a desire to initiate a hiring process for the executive director which would have to be put on hold for one year should this pass.",337,,
1172,0.97,6660.253,6665.859,"They've agreed to a five-year Rfp, but there are concerns about an Rfq one year later.",337,,
1173,0.97,6665.859,6681.775,They are worried this will Introdeuce uncertainty about who the Bia operator will be at a time when continuity is needed as they grapple from the impacts of Covid.,337,,
1174,0.97,6681.775,6692.452,And Udp has been operating with the interim Ed for the last two years and waiting for reauthorization to search for a new executive director.,337,,
1175,0.97,6692.452,6699.793,A one-year authorization would not attract a candidate and would produce more uncertainty.,337,,
1176,0.97,6699.793,6712.338,"So in addition to shrinking the term from 12 years to 10 years, which runs counter to the community engagement, where the majority of Stakeholders like the 12-year process, I'm concerned about those issues.",337,,
1177,0.97,6712.338,6715.341,And right now I'm leaning towards voting no on this amendment.,337,,
1178,0.97,6715.341,6730.724,"I just wanted to hear if there was any feedback from that, those questions or concerns I wanted to flag for you my concerns on that.",337,,
1179,0.97,6730.724,6737.063,"Councilmember Pedersen or Morales, any response to that?",338,,
1180,0.97,6737.063,6740.8,I think Councilmember Morales is on mute.,339,,
1181,0.97,6740.8,6752.545,"Yeah, so what I will say is that there are a couple of--so these have been restructured a little bit.",340,,
1182,0.97,6752.545,6757.984,"I don't necessarily 10 years or 12 years to me is not significant enough difference, candidly.",340,,
1183,0.97,6757.984,6788.681,"I think for me the part that I struggle with in amendment two is really about shortening the term for the program manager, in part because we are talking about increasing the responsibility at Oed within a year when it is a fairly small Department with a small budget and will be taxed even more DEB this budget crisis.",340,,
1184,0.97,6788.681,6805.365,"The idea of setting that precedent of them moving so quickly when we have other bias that might also want to move in this direction, I am really worried about the capacity of the Department to carry this out.",340,,
1185,0.97,6805.365,6810.57,"And just the question about, you know, the existing program manager.",340,,
1186,0.97,6810.57,6827.487,"I understand that, you know, other organizations might be interested in bidding to take that role, to take on that role and those responsibilities, but there's nothing preventing them from doing that now.",340,,
1187,0.97,6827.487,6838.464,And so creating this process just doesn't--it's just not--I just don't see a clear rationale for creating this extra process right now.,340,,
1188,0.97,6838.464,6840.867,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",341,,
1189,0.97,6840.867,6846.005,Any other questions or comments on amendment two?,341,,
1190,0.97,6846.005,6847.04,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",341,,
1191,0.97,6847.04,6847.841,Thank you.,342,,
1192,0.97,6847.841,6870.997,"So for many, many years, we've heard from businesses in the U district about their concerns, about the structure of the Bia, the perception that the University of Washington has an outsized role as compared to other businesses.",342,,
1193,0.97,6870.997,6877.57,So I really appreciate the fact that the bill addresses this.,342,,
1194,0.97,6877.57,6895.622,"And given that there have been, you know, many years of concerns that I've heard from businesses that don't feel well represented by the Bia, normally I would have been inclined to support amendment two.",342,,
1195,0.97,6895.622,6943.503,"The problem is--and I acknowledge I may have missed some correspondence, but I've looked in my Emails, and there are about 5,000 in the Inbox, but I have only found one Email in support of this amendment, and so I'm--you know, when I'm working on legislation that is intended to sort of Buck the status quo and address concerns that folks who don't feel represented have identified, I really need to hear from folks to sort of confirm for myself that this is a problem that many people feel needs addressing.",342,,
1196,0.97,6943.503,6957.884,"And so given the fact that there has only been one person that I can find that has written in support of amendment two, I am not inclined to vote in support of it.",342,,
1197,0.97,6957.884,6965.758,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",343,,
1198,0.97,6965.758,6966.993,Any other comments or questions?,343,,
1199,0.97,6966.993,6976.369,"Okay, hearing none, I would just say that I am of the same mind as Councilmember Herbold on this one.",343,,
1200,0.97,6976.369,6996.022,I have had an opportunity to dig through my Inbox as well and have seen that an overwhelming amount of people are expressing support for the Bia as a whole and with really specific requests to not support amendment two.,343,,
1201,0.97,6996.022,7010.269,"And in particular, we have a letter from quite a number of nonprofit organizations in the U district who have expressed concerns about this.",343,,
1202,0.97,7010.269,7017.61,"Maureen Ewing called in today for purposes of supporting the Bia, but expressing their collective concerns on this particular amendment.",343,,
1203,0.97,7017.61,7022.015,"So at this point, I don't feel that I can support amendment two.",343,,
1204,0.97,7022.015,7047.807,And I also take to heart the% comments made by Councilmember Morales in terms of the additional burden this will place on Oed in the context of potentially restricted budget that those resources are going to be a little bit more limited than usual for Oed in terms of executing on the intent and purpose of the Bia.,343,,
1205,0.97,7047.807,7064.223,"I do appreciate the sponsor's interest in trying to sort of right size this issue for smaller businesses and--but Unfortunately, I don't think I can support this amendment at this juncture.",343,,
1206,0.97,7064.223,7072.365,"I'm happy to give you the last word, Councilmember Pedersen, if you have anything else you'd like to add before I call the roll.",343,,
1207,0.97,7072.365,7073.666,"Thank you, Council President.",344,,
1208,0.97,7073.666,7077.904,I want to thank my colleagues for their comments and their valid points.,344,,
1209,0.97,7077.904,7097.423,"And certainly the situation with the interim executive director, the need to make that permanent and Covid has created, you know, complications regarding this, but I really hope that the public can see that, you know, even if this amendment doesn't pass, there are improvements.",344,,
1210,0.97,7097.423,7098.324,We have better representation.,344,,
1211,0.97,7098.324,7102.395,"We have better Governance built in, prevention of displacement.",344,,
1212,0.97,7102.395,7111.27,"I hope the public can see here's a city council that is collaborating, that is focused on the basics when we can do that during these crises.",344,,

1275,0.97,7275.234,7279.305,It's been moved and Seconded to adopt the resolution.,389,,
1276,0.97,7279.305,7293.886,"Again, colleagues, as I mentioned this morning during Council briefing, this resolution is designed to support the summer budget session that we'll be undergoing the next six weeks under the leadership of chair Mosqueda.",389,,
1277,0.97,7293.886,7294.553,It's a standard resolution.,389,,
1278,0.97,7294.553,7301.46,It's similar to the one that we would normally Atonight during the fall budget season.,389,,
1279,0.97,7301.46,7324.25,Except we are adopting it in this context for the summer since we know that there will be a longer and deeper dive into the rebalancing package that is going be transmitted to us by the Mayor's office later this week.,389,,
1280,0.97,7324.25,7350.743,"And I continue to believe that it's important for us to be sure that we are focussing all of our resources, including attention from Council central staff and from our respective offices and from each other towards the efforts that will be before us in terms of the work that Councilmember Mosqueda outlined in Council briefing this morning as it relates to this budget opportunity.",389,,
1281,0.97,7350.743,7353.646,So this resolution will suspend regular committee meetings.,389,,
1282,0.97,7353.646,7362.755,"As I mentioned this morning, there will be an opportunity to have some exceptions to those rules to the standard rule of no committee meetings.",389,,
1283,0.97,7362.755,7391.951,"I would ask that you, in those instances, if you have time sensitive legislation I would ask that you reach out directly to my office to coordinate that work so that we can again make sure we're fulfilling the intent of making sure that Council central staff is able to focus on the many budget issues and questions that will be coming before us.",389,,
1284,0.97,7391.951,7396.589,So happy to answer any questions and take any comments.,389,,

1286,0.97,7397.223,7397.556,Thank you.,390,,
1287,0.97,7397.556,7425.251,It would be helpful to get some guidance if not now later on what bills you are okay with still moving directly to full it'll help us make that decision whether or not we're going to ask for a special committee meeting or whether or not we should just continue the practice of moving the bill on to full council.,390,,
1288,0.97,7425.251,7426.252,Appreciate that.,391,,
1289,0.97,7426.252,7433.426,I think my staff has been working with Council central staff on trying to pull together some of that language.,391,,
1290,0.97,7433.426,7439.965,So we'll make sure to circle back with you all so you have clear guidance.,391,,
1291,0.97,7439.965,7451.577,Or as clear as I can get it to make sure that Tokes know what can be sent to full Council and when specialization is going to be needed for potential committee work.,391,,
1292,0.97,7451.577,7453.679,But I'm happy--we're on it.,391,,
1293,0.97,7453.679,7460.653,We're beginning to--I hear the request and I'll make sure to circulate that hopefully before the end of the week.,391,,
1294,0.97,7460.653,7461.987,Thank you.,392,,
1295,0.97,7461.987,7464.156,You're welcome.,393,,

1300,0.97,7502.161,7508.501,So just wanted to thank you for your words this morning and express my appreciation for your leadership.,394,,

1305,0.97,7523.515,7529.255,I wanted to reiterate some of my points from this morning for members of the public who are watching.,396,,
1306,0.97,7529.255,7546.939,"I announced midweek last week I intend to bring forward legislation in support of the demand of the justice for George Floyd movement to cut the police Department budget by 50%, to Defund police and to instead fund grassroots programs for rest RA Tif justice.",396,,
1307,0.97,7546.939,7553.312,"As I mentioned earlier, this can be done by other means, by Edding the purchase of the so-called crowd control weapons.",396,,
1308,0.97,7553.312,7557.516,We will find other things to cut as well.,396,,
1309,0.97,7557.516,7560.819,And ending police violence against demonstrations.,396,,
1310,0.97,7560.819,7571.03,"Additionally, the idea of an austerity budget which corporate Mayor Durkan is bringing forward, that is cutting the funds to the city Department that is support our communities is totally unacceptable.",396,,
1311,0.97,7571.03,7583.208,"The Covid-19 crisis has created an economic crisis that is leaving over 100,000 Seattleites and tens of millions nationwide unemployed or with reduced hours.",396,,
1312,0.97,7583.208,7602.094,We cannot have elected officials saying that black lives matter and then turn around and represent big business and the wealthy in passing an austerity budget or in opposing a legislation like the Amazon tax which my office has worked along with Councilmember Morales along with our movement.,396,,
1313,0.97,7602.094,7619.211,"The Amazon tax is a modest tax on big business to expand publicly owned, Rent-Controlled social housing to begin to strike a blow against racist Gentrification that working class communities of color have faced for decades.",396,,
1314,0.97,7619.211,7625.05,It will also create decent jobs with priority hire and apprenticeship programs.,396,,
1315,0.97,7625.05,7631.357,This is a concrete way the city council can put dollars to our words on the fact that black lives matter.,396,,
1316,0.97,7631.357,7643.102,"Throughout history, the greater the inequality in our society, the more Militarized its policing needs to be for the ruling class to Perpetwait and defend those inequities.",396,,
1317,0.97,7643.102,7658.183,"Sociologically speaking, we can predict in the coming years, Seattle or any other city will either make massive new public investments in jobs, programs, social housing and other policies that regular people need or we will see more and more violent policing.",396,,
1318,0.97,7658.183,7678.27,I also wanted to remind members of the public that my Socialist Council office alongside our people's budget campaign has proposed for years Defunding the police to fund tiny House villages and restorative justice.,396,,
1319,0.97,7678.27,7686.578,"And Council after Council, including current Councilmembers, have voted against Defunding the police and against stopping the homeless Sweeps.",396,,
1320,0.97,7686.578,7696.789,"On a majority people of color Council, I was, unfortunately, the only no vote on a Seattle police officers Guild contract that rolled back accountability measures.",396,,
1321,0.97,7696.789,7708.801,"What we are seeing now is how, when there are movements and actually an uprising on the streets, the same politicians will feel the pressure to do the right thing.",396,,
1322,0.97,7708.801,7709.868,Our movements cannot relent.,396,,
1323,0.97,7709.868,7716.875,We will not win Defund police to cut the police budget by half if we do the not build an even more powerful movement.,396,,
1324,0.97,7716.875,7723.382,That is why I urge community members to join me at Cal Anderson park at 6:00 P.M.,396,,
1325,0.97,7723.382,7736.128,"Where our movement will discuss our strategy to win Defund police, to win the Amazon tax and to actually have police accountability and end racist Gentrification.",396,,

1357,0.97,7816.642,7821.079,It's been moved and Seconded to adopt resolution 31948.,421,,
1358,0.97,7821.079,7826.451,"Councilmember Lewis, you are the prime sponsor of this resolution and you are recognized in order to address this item.",421,,
1359,0.97,7826.451,7827.486,The floor is yours.,421,,
1360,0.97,7827.486,7829.588,"Thank you so much, Madame President.",422,,
1361,0.97,7829.588,7835.594,I'll be brief since I did speak to this during briefing this morning already.,422,,
1362,0.97,7835.594,7858.483,"You know, I brought this forward because last Monday we did have this announcement from the President stating his intent to potentially use Unconstitutionally use the insurrection act to dispatch United States military forces to disrupt peaceful demonstrations in American cities.",422,,
1363,0.97,7858.483,7875.868,The insurrection act requires the jurisdictions that the Federal government would use the insurrection act to respond to ascent to military force being dispatched to the city or the state in question.,422,,
1364,0.97,7875.868,7888.213,"I, just to be preemptive on this, especially since we know this particular President's behavior can get more erratic and unpredictable as he continues to get into a hole and to get more unpopular.",422,,
1365,0.97,7888.213,7893.552,A CNN poll today showed him trailing his opponent by 14 points nationally.,422,,
1366,0.97,7893.552,7913.438,"And this is exactly the kind of place where one has learned to be concerned about the actions that this President might take since he has threatened this action and since, you know, it's been proven time and time again that sometimes we have to take these threats seriously from this particular President.",422,,
1367,0.97,7913.438,7937.195,I thought that it would be a pragmatic move for us to Preemptively condemn this and make it clear we will not ascent to this kind of military presence in our city and hope that other cities will follow suit in rejecting this threat that is being levelled by the Federal Government to use the United States military against American civilians.,422,,
1368,0.97,7937.195,7938.13,I'll leave it at that.,422,,
1369,0.97,7938.13,7943.735,"And you know, anyone else has any comments, we can continue to talk about it.",422,,
1370,0.97,7943.735,7945.771,"Otherwise, I'm ready to vote any old time.",422,,
1371,0.97,7945.771,7949.007,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Lewis.",423,,
1372,0.97,7949.007,7954.446,Are there any comments on the resolution?,423,,
1373,0.97,7954.446,7954.646,Okay.,423,,
1374,0.97,7954.646,7958.517,Looks like nobody has any comments.,423,,
1375,0.97,7958.517,7959.418,"Oh, there we go.",423,,
1376,0.97,7959.418,7960.052,"Councilmember Sawant, please.",423,,
1377,0.97,7960.052,7961.32,"Thank you, president Gonzalez.",424,,
1378,0.97,7961.32,7972.431,"I will vote yes on this resolution, of course, because I agree with its main point, which is to oppose Donald Trump's threat to send Federal National Guard troops into cities like Seattle to put down protests.",424,,
1379,0.97,7972.431,7991.917,"I did want to state for the record I do not agree with many of the clauses which could imply, I don't know if that's the intent and I don't want to say that, but it's possible it could imply that there's somehow something acceptable about governor Inslee sending in the National Guard and the Federal National Guard troops are the only problem.",424,,
1380,0.97,7991.917,8002.327,"I don't know that that's the intent, but I just wanted to state that for the record that I oppose both Federal and state National Guard troops being used against protest movements.",424,,
1381,0.97,8002.327,8015.073,"However, again, that is just an issue with the wording in the clauses, the main purpose of this resolution, which is the be it resolved section, is opposing Trump to send Federal troops.",424,,
1382,0.97,8015.073,8017.876,I absolutely agree with that and will vote yes.,424,,
1383,0.97,8017.876,8021.847,"I can briefly respond, Madame President, if that's okay?",425,,
1384,0.97,8021.847,8022.814,Of course.,426,,
1385,0.97,8022.814,8025.417,"Councilmember Sawant, I appreciate you raising that.",427,,
1386,0.97,8025.417,8030.722,That was more to establish a historical record of what has happened.,427,,
1387,0.97,8030.722,8035.594,Those clauses are not intended as Endorsements or to support some of those actions.,427,,
1388,0.97,8035.594,8041.733,"I mean, it also mentions in the clauses some of the curfews which I know a number of us did not find advisable.",427,,
1389,0.97,8041.733,8063.388,"So those aren't to be put in there as Endorsements of those policies, but merely to reflect kind of the city's actions that have led up to this and certainly don't warrant adding on top of them a Federalized military presence that would not be warranted and would not help.",427,,
1390,0.97,8063.388,8065.424,Great.,428,,
1391,0.97,8065.424,8070.462,Thank you so much for the clarification.,428,,
1392,0.97,8070.462,8072.731,I would echo those concerns.,428,,
1393,0.97,8072.731,8091.85,"I think many of us, at least from my viewing of many folks social media accounts, it seems like many of us have taken a position that is Unsupportive of continuing to have the presence of the National Guard here.",428,,
1394,0.97,8091.85,8106.832,I can certainly speak for myself that I don't think that it is necessary to have the National Guard here and think that it further creates an image of Militarization of our streets.,428,,
1395,0.97,8106.832,8118.143,"And you know, the reality is is when people, ordinary people are out on the streets protesting and trying to exercise their first amendment, they're not distinguishing between who's National Guard and who's SPD.",428,,
1396,0.97,8118.143,8121.646,All they see is military on our streets.,428,,
1397,0.97,8121.646,8152.144,"You know, I had the benefit of seeing Video from a friend of our family who was coming back from the peninsula visiting her parents and on I-5 coming North literally saw tank after tank after tank after tank of National Guard soldiers making their way into Seattle.",428,,
1398,0.97,8152.144,8167.926,"So it is, you know--the National Guard being present here is as problematic as President Trump potentially triggering the insurrection Act and completely unacceptable in my mind.",428,,
1399,0.97,8167.926,8178.403,"So can't--couldn't agree more with the sentiments already being shared by the sponsor of the resolution and Councilmember Sawant, appreciate her for bringing that up.",428,,
1400,0.97,8178.403,8179.037,"Any other comments, colleagues?",428,,
1401,0.97,8179.037,8179.538,All right.,428,,
1402,0.97,8179.538,8181.773,Let's go ahead and take a vote.,428,,
1403,0.97,8181.773,8190.148,Will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of the resolution?,428,,
1404,0.97,8190.148,8190.448,Mosqueda?,429,,

1425,0.97,8219.611,8219.811,Okay.,448,,
1426,0.97,8219.811,8229.154,"Other business, we have a couple of letters for consideration here as described by Councilmember Herbold during this morning's Council Briefig.",448,,
1427,0.97,8229.154,8246.705,So I'm going to go ahead and call on Councilmember Herbold--signature on a--on the two different letters she described during Council briefing this morning.,448,,
1428,0.97,8246.705,8254.446,Thank you for talking very slowly so I could get to my mute button.,449,,
1429,0.97,8254.446,8277.702,"So letter one is a letter to Mayor Durkan and chief best firmly requesting that they direct SPD to change tactics, take urgent and sustained action to De-Escalate police tactics used in daily protests and noting that tactics are currently placing constitutional rights at a risk.",449,,
1430,0.97,8277.702,8290.248,The letter makes note that health risks are being exacerbated amidst a devastating respiratory epidemic and bringing emotional trauma and racial aggression.,449,,
1431,0.97,8290.248,8307.966,And it notes that deploying police in riot gear to form a wall of officers positioned against peaceful protesters is not conducive to De-Escalation and healing.,449,,
1432,0.97,8307.966,8339.597,"The letter identifies five recommendations and not just recommendations but those five items are pledged to work on those--on these five things to advance and support policies brought forward by community voices, particularly Black-Led movements, to one, Demiliarize the police, two, further restrict use of excessive or deadly force by police, three, increase accountability and transparency in police Union contracts.",449,,
1433,0.97,8339.597,8345.437,"Four, give subpoena and other investigative powers to independent oversight boards.",449,,
1434,0.97,8345.437,8350.608,"Five, redirect police Department's funding to Community-Based alternatives.",449,,
1435,0.97,8350.608,8364.222,"Though we all know we must do much more than those five priorities, I want to make a note of a few things that the Council has been doing along these lines.",449,,
1436,0.97,8364.222,8381.106,"A few years ago, Councilmembers adopted legislation that I introduced to make it illegal for SPD to participate in any kind of Federal program that transfers excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies at reduced or no cost.",449,,
1437,0.97,8381.106,8389.881,That's a signal from the Council that we do not wish to H Militarized police Department.,449,,
1438,0.97,8389.881,8410.902,"The Council adopted a resolution on negotiations with the police Guild that includes recommendations by the community police Commission, the inspector general and the office of police accountability in support of greater accountability and greater transparency in the bargaining process.",449,,
1439,0.97,8410.902,8426.117,"In addition, subpoena power is included in the 2017 police accountability ordinance sponsored by Council President Lorena Gonzalez and it was identified in the contract as a Re-Opener.",449,,
1440,0.97,8426.117,8432.824,"And as mentioned this morning, I'm currently working with the city attorney on potential ways to refine the process for this.",449,,
1441,0.97,8432.824,8447.772,And I think it's also important to note that many of us on the Council have worked for several years to get the community service officer program reestablished.,449,,
1442,0.97,8447.772,8451.643,This was disbanded in 2009 in response to the recession then.,449,,
1443,0.97,8451.643,8465.924,And many of us have been working really hard because of the recognition that not every public safety issue needs an officer to respond.,449,,
1444,0.97,8465.924,8474.866,Not every public safety issue is well addressed when an officer respond.,449,,
1445,0.97,8474.866,8483.475,And we need people who have area expertise to be responding to many of the things that the police Department currently responds to.,449,,
1446,0.97,8483.475,8508.5,"And I just want to also before we do the roll call for signatures, I want to thank the fact that we've so far had four Councilmembers sign, myself, Council President Gonzalez, Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Mosqueda, and a Goodly number of King County Councilmembers and state Reps.",449,,
1447,0.97,8508.5,8513.872,"And as I see the post on Facebook the letters that are out there, the list is growing.",449,,
1448,0.97,8513.872,8535.293,"And this is, I think, a really unprecedented show of solidarity that elected lawmakers have across the region on asking our Mayor and chief to work with us to accomplish these goals.",449,,
1449,0.97,8535.293,8539.664,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for that description.",450,,
1450,0.97,8539.664,8547.672,Are there any questions on the letter just described by Councilmember Herbold or any comments?,450,,
1451,0.97,8547.672,8548.74,"Council President, it's Councilmember Juarez.",451,,
1452,0.97,8548.74,8553.211,I just have one comment about the letter.,451,,
1453,0.97,8553.211,8555.079,"Sure, please.",452,,
1454,0.97,8555.079,8555.747,Thank you.,453,,
1455,0.97,8555.747,8557.448,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",453,,
1456,0.97,8557.448,8567.725,"And I know Council President, you addressed some of the issues of why particular Councilmembers signed the letter, the open public meeting act in your concerns.",453,,
1457,0.97,8567.725,8582.173,"I would just ask in the future, I did not hear about the letter or see it until the media on Twitter forwarded--I got four texts on Twitter of the letter.",453,,
1458,0.97,8582.173,8584.108,Apparently it was released to the media.,453,,
1459,0.97,8584.108,8587.912,And that was at 9:40 last night.,453,,
1460,0.97,8587.912,8592.05,I didn't see the original actual letter until later today.,453,,
1461,0.97,8592.05,8606.197,"So I would just ask as a courtesy, if you take the time to release letters and drafts to the media, that you at least take the time to forward drafts or concerns to your colleagues.",453,,
1462,0.97,8606.197,8609.2,I have no problem signing the letter.,453,,
1463,0.97,8609.2,8625.617,"I'll be honest with you, it's a little disconcerting when you have two media outlets and other Electeds who are sending you Twitter Screenshots and sending you copies of what's already out there, but your colleagues haven't shared anything with you.",453,,
1464,0.97,8625.617,8628.62,So I'm just going to leave it there.,453,,
1465,0.97,8628.62,8630.989,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez for those remarks.",454,,
1466,0.97,8630.989,8636.461,I want to clarify this was not an effort being led by Seattle city Councilmembers.,454,,
1467,0.97,8636.461,8642.734,It was an effort being led by other elected officials who approached some of us on the city council.,454,,
1468,0.97,8642.734,8658.049,So I don't want to leave you with the impression that those Seattle city Councilmembers who signed the letter were the organizers.,454,,
1469,0.97,8658.049,8667.458,"I don't think that that's what we intended to Insinuate, because that's not how the letters came about.",454,,
1470,0.97,8667.458,8679.47,"So I know Councilmember Herbold wanted to add a little more to that, so I'll hand it over to her.",454,,
1471,0.97,8679.47,8686.044,"I just--I appreciate, president Gonzalez, the events that led to Ourion of the signatures on the letter.",455,,

1473,0.97,8691.349,8695.72,I did--I could have shared it with Councilmembers.,455,,
1474,0.97,8695.72,8710.601,"There was a point at which a number of us were deciding that we were--and not just Councilmembers, other signers, were deciding we were going to start sharing it on social media.",455,,
1475,0.97,8710.601,8724.549,I reached out to our director about putting--about the Councilmembers who had signed it putting out a press advisory which would have meant that you had all received it.,455,,
1476,0.97,8724.549,8741.432,"But out of recognition that we were doing this at 6:30 on a Sunday night, and the work that our COMM staff has been doing, I kind of made the call not to have her put out a press advisory.",455,,
1477,0.97,8741.432,8753.444,"In doing so, I should have definitely shared the draft with the other five Councilmembers, and I apologize for not doing so.",455,,
1478,0.97,8753.444,8755.279,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",456,,
1479,0.97,8755.279,8756.747,All right.,457,,

1507,0.97,8808.499,8809.267,I do indeed.,481,,
1508,0.97,8809.267,8815.139,"And this one did go out for circulation a couple times, so.",481,,
1509,0.97,8815.139,8832.523,So this is a letter specifically requesting that the city attorney withdraw the city of Seattle's litigation seeking to block inquest reforms initiated by King County executive Constantine.,481,,
1510,0.97,8832.523,8851.542,So there has been a public call on behalf of Execu Constantine and activists who are aware of this city and other city's lawsuits against the inquest reforms.,481,,
1511,0.97,8851.542,8873.197,"The inquest reforms led by King County executive Dow Constantine were the result of about an Eight-Month process developed with the families of Tommy Lee, Shea Taylor, John T. Williams and Charleena Lyles, as well as community groups such as the CPC, the community police Commission, and others.",481,,
1512,0.97,8873.197,8880.104,The reformed inquest process was supposed to be put in place in 2019.,481,,

1515,0.97,8899.824,8930.521,"The letter notes that--the letter itself that we're circulating, notes that the Mayor mentioned during a meeting of the community police Commission last week that she was unaware of the lawsuit and the CPC indicated that despite the fact that they had taken positions in favor of the inquest reforms, they were not given any advance notice of the city filing challenges to those reforms.",481,,
1516,0.97,8930.521,8941.799,"For many years, the inquest system operated functionally to Legitimize and Immunize all deaths in public custody.",481,,
1517,0.97,8941.799,8945.002,The bar is very easy for an officer to meet.,481,,
1518,0.97,8945.002,8958.649,"For the most part, they still my have to testify that they were in fear of harm to themselves to their body and for their life.",481,,
1519,0.97,8958.649,8971.929,The county executive convened a distinguished and balanced panel to lead a Communitywide conversation about possible reforms to the inquest process.,481,,
1520,0.97,8971.929,9014.305,"And some news about this is I've been talking to city attorney Holmes about the fact this letter was coming, and we have learned that the city attorney and the county executive are in conversations, but given that the Mayor indicated that she did not seek the writ and was unaware of it, it does seem appropriate for the city attorney to immediately withdraw the litigation that was brought on behalf of the city of Seattle.",481,,
1521,0.97,9014.305,9018.809,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold, for advancing this letter as well.",482,,
