75,0.97,513.279,525.458,"The legislation in front of the committee would extend the terms of approval or grant final approval for one of them with the condition, so central staff memo is excellent, provides detail and rationale for the legislation.",11,,
76,0.97,525.458,529.095,"So, as usual, we will offer central staff members the opportunity.",11,,
77,0.97,529.095,537.87,"If they want to speak to this, we can turn it over to Sdot.",11,,
78,0.97,537.87,540.907,"So, good morning, is there anything you want to discuss?",11,,

96,0.97,619.952,624.256,"Just given everything that's going on with Covid, they need a little bit more time and we fully support that.",14,,
97,0.97,624.256,631.764,"So, here it is, brad, if you want to take a couple minutes to remind the committee where this is at, and then--so --",14,,
98,0.97,631.764,636.769,And Mike can say a couple words as well.,15,,
99,0.97,636.769,637.203,"Thanks, Beverly.",15,,
100,0.97,637.203,649.582,"This is the building which is referred to as block 95 until we come up with a better name, we can click to the next slide.",15,,
101,0.97,649.582,652.251,"Just as a reminder, there were three petitions approved in 2016.",15,,
102,0.97,652.251,655.087,Those had to do with block 95.,15,,
103,0.97,655.087,658.124,There is the allocation between Cherry and Columbia.,15,,
104,0.97,658.124,674.407,"There is the minor Avenue sky bridge which connects the building to the main hospital, and there is a tunnel under minor street that serves as sort of an Umbilical cord for all the services that will connect to the hospital.",15,,
105,0.97,674.407,676.609,So those are the three petitions that were approved.,15,,
106,0.97,676.609,683.783,"-- all associated public and if it's in the process, we went through.",15,,
107,0.97,683.783,685.918,We are quite pleased even though there has been some delay.,15,,
108,0.97,685.918,687.82,"Go ahead to the next slide, sorry.",15,,
109,0.97,687.82,698.531,"We are preparing to break ground this fall, and are looking toward completion in 2025.",15,,

111,0.97,708.874,710.342,And I think that was it.,15,,
112,0.97,710.342,711.744,I appreciate the Council for this.,16,,
113,0.97,711.744,716.849,I look forward to starting the project.,16,,
114,0.97,716.849,719.051,"So I think, that is all we needed to cover.",17,,
115,0.97,719.051,723.823,Amy is here if there are questions on the tunnel or the sky bridge.,17,,
116,0.97,723.823,725.558,I can answer any questions on the vacation.,17,,
117,0.97,725.558,731.263,This is a simple request for time which we do support.,17,,
118,0.97,731.263,739.839,"We would be happy to address any questions, and brad and Nancy Rogers and Mike can cover anything about the project, but I think that's all we wanted to cover.",17,,
119,0.97,739.839,742.208,Thank you.,18,,
120,0.97,742.208,768.434,"I appreciate the briefing before the meeting as well to ask any questions about this, but I concur, this is essentially an extension request, something that was approved in 2016, and we will get to see this again for final approval after construction--after the construction takes place, and the conditions are met.",18,,
121,0.97,768.434,772.304,"And so, Lish, is there anything you wanted to add?",18,,
122,0.97,772.304,781.614,"Just clarify that for the tunnel, this is the initial approval of the 15 year term for that tunnel.",19,,
123,0.97,781.614,786.519,Conditional approval was previously granted in 2016.,19,,
124,0.97,786.519,787.119,This is relevant.,19,,
125,0.97,787.119,791.757,Thank you for clarifying on the tunnel item.,20,,
126,0.97,791.757,804.17,"And so, I will be making three different motions to approve these items, and then with the clerk file, we will actually be incorporating your central staff memo into that item.",20,,
127,0.97,804.17,811.243,Is that correct?,20,,
128,0.97,811.243,822.188,"Yeah, it is the attachment to my memo, and includes conditions that would be placed on this allocation.",21,,
129,0.97,822.188,829.962,"We will be incorporating your central staff memo into the clerk file as part of the motion, so it is more official.",22,,
130,0.97,829.962,839.705,"Council members, any questions for central staff on this--these three items?",22,,
131,0.97,839.705,839.939,Okay.,22,,
132,0.97,839.939,841.24,"I'll go ahead--Councilmember hurtled, please.",22,,
133,0.97,841.24,842.775,"I'm slow on the uptake, here.",23,,
134,0.97,842.775,852.284,"So we are--we are considering item 4 as part of the packet, is that correct?",23,,
135,0.97,852.284,854.52,Correct.,24,,
136,0.97,854.52,854.82,Go ahead.,24,,
137,0.97,854.82,885.618,"So as it relates to the block 95 construction schedule, construction schedule to complete at the end of 2024, just wondering, the thinking behind this particular extension going to 2029?",25,,
138,0.97,885.618,890.322,Are you able to answer that?,26,,
139,0.97,890.322,894.96,You--you are on mute.,26,,
140,0.97,894.96,900.032,"Sorry, mute defeats us all.",27,,
141,0.97,900.032,905.137,"I think, when we look at the approval time period, we want to make sure it is adequate.",27,,
142,0.97,905.137,910.576,As is the expectation that seems grounded in reality.,27,,
143,0.97,910.576,913.712,"But with the last extension, there were circumstances that were unanticipated.",27,,
144,0.97,913.712,952.017,"Rather than being in the position of granting a tight Timeframe, then needing to come back when construction might be midway, I think we are trying to look at a really realistic Timeframe if other unanticipated things, a pandemic or something, steel shortage--it is just to make sure that they have more than adequate time to complete everything so we don't have to come back and say, we didn't make the Timeframe, which uses a lot of committee time when you already supported the project, so it is just caution.",27,,
145,0.97,952.017,952.618,Thank you.,28,,
146,0.97,952.618,958.924,"Council members, any additional questions?",29,,
147,0.97,958.924,973.505,"And Lish, from central staff, just to confirm, the attachment we are incorporating, are we incorporating that into the clerk file item?",29,,
148,0.97,973.505,974.406,Correct.,30,,
149,0.97,974.406,978.877,"It is an update to the conditions that were placed on the street vacation, and the only change is to extend the date.",30,,
150,0.97,978.877,979.645,"Okay, great.",31,,
151,0.97,979.645,983.716,"I see, thank you.",31,,
152,0.97,983.716,991.023,"Okay, Council members, I would like to start moving these items for a vote to extend them onto the full council.",31,,
153,0.97,991.023,1001.367,"Council members, I move that the committee recommend passage of bill 1201C--33, item 2 on the Non-Revised agenda.",31,,
154,0.97,1001.367,1003.635,Is there a second?,31,,

235,0.97,1302.634,1304.436,Okay.,79,,
236,0.97,1304.436,1320.485,"This bill, today, consists of months of collaboration, actually years in the making about naming historical markers and honoring those other than Jefferson, Roosevelt, Washington, Lincoln, Franklin--I could go on.",79,,
237,0.97,1320.485,1334.499,We have been Lamenting this from when Councilmember Bradshaw was still on the Council.,79,,
238,0.97,1334.499,1335.901,We have been working community in citywide.,79,,
239,0.97,1335.901,1339.571,We completed a citywide inventory of all the names of public Infrastructures in the city of Seattle.,79,,
240,0.97,1339.571,1340.906,What we found out wasn't that shocking.,79,,
241,0.97,1340.906,1351.583,"There was very little black, indigenous, Asian, and Lgbtq people acknowledged, memorialized, or Landmarked.",79,,
242,0.97,1351.583,1372.971,"And, in particular, in district V, there is currently not a single school, Park, street, library, pool, or natural habitat, that would be a river, Lake or stream, or community center named after an American--African-American or black leader.",79,,
243,0.97,1372.971,1386.218,"So, we considered many names for this bridge and decided to put forth the name of the honorable U.S. representative, John Lewis.",79,,
244,0.97,1386.218,1394.326,"As you know, John Lewis passed away in 2020 after serving as the U.S. representative for Georgia's fifth congressional district for more than 30 years.",79,,

246,0.97,1402.467,1410.275,"I am joined today by 2 incredible leaders, Larry Gossett, and the President of Marcel college, Chemene Crawford.",79,,

249,0.97,1426.258,1426.458,Okay.,79,,
250,0.97,1426.458,1433.665,"Mr. Gosset, or Council member Gosset, that is all you.",79,,
251,0.97,1433.665,1434.666,Thank you very much.,80,,
252,0.97,1434.666,1436.468,I hope that everyone can hear me this morning.,80,,
253,0.97,1436.468,1436.902,We can.,81,,
254,0.97,1436.902,1437.903,"Okay, thank you.",82,,
255,0.97,1437.903,1456.288,I would like to 1ST thank Debora Juarez for recommending the name for this important pedestrian and bicycle bridge that we are building in North Seattle.,82,,
256,0.97,1456.288,1495.627,"I think it is particularly significant to name the bridge after John Lewis at this historic juncture, where we are having a national debate over whether or not we should accept the John Lewis for the people act as a way of mitigating against what I believe is a horrible trend of creating voter suppression legislation in at least 48 States in our Union, and some of the States have already passed this.",82,,
257,0.97,1495.627,1503.735,"And the only way we can maximize, in my opinion, support for voting rights is to pass this measure.",82,,
258,0.97,1503.735,1512.844,"But here in Seattle, it is very important that we adopt this suggestion that we name the bill in honor of John Lewis.",82,,
259,0.97,1512.844,1523.054,I did not know the Statistics that Councilmember Juarez mentioned.,82,,
260,0.97,1523.054,1533.164,[Indiscernible] it reinforces the importance of making this name change at this time.,82,,
261,0.97,1533.164,1551.383,I wanted to be supportive and have the city Council and broader community know that I strongly support the measure because I met John Lewis in 1963 when he was living for a short period of time in New York and working on the civil rights movement.,82,,
262,0.97,1551.383,1557.188,We attended the Anti-Vietnam war rally in Manhattan.,82,,
263,0.97,1557.188,1558.99,We got to know each other.,82,,
264,0.97,1558.99,1566.698,"We accidentally found out he and I both have the same birthday, that is February 21st.",82,,
265,0.97,1566.698,1598.163,"He is about five years older than I, but we started our relationship by communicating to one another every couple of years from 66 until he passed, a few years away--ago--I can't think of a symbol or namesake or entity in Seattle that will be more revered.",82,,
266,0.97,1598.163,1618.917,"This proposed change is because most people in the country, my estimation or opinion, love the work that John Lewis did to support democratic change and improving of the basic citizen rights of all Americans.",82,,
267,0.97,1618.917,1655.687,"So in due respect, I am honored to be the first person at this committee meeting to get the opportunity to reinforce the measure that Councilmember Juarez has just put forth in honoring John Lewis by having this important bridge provide a really excellent way to a major transportation entity in the community for the people of Seattle--thank you very much for allowing me the time on your agenda.",82,,
268,0.97,1655.687,1661.726,"Thank you, council member Gosset.",83,,
269,0.97,1661.726,1666.998,Thank you Dr. Crawford for being with us as well.,83,,
270,0.97,1666.998,1673.304,"We would love to hear from you, too.",83,,
271,0.97,1673.304,1675.14,Absolutely.,84,,
272,0.97,1675.14,1676.207,Is a much for inviting me.,84,,
273,0.97,1676.207,1677.208,I prepared remarks as well.,84,,
274,0.97,1677.208,1678.81,I know there is a time limit.,84,,
275,0.97,1678.81,1680.712,I could go on and on about this topic.,84,,
276,0.97,1680.712,1683.314,"So I am--I'm--engaging myself, here.",84,,
277,0.97,1683.314,1684.315,"Good morning, Council members.",84,,
278,0.97,1684.315,1684.916,Dr. Chemene Crawford.,84,,
279,0.97,1684.916,1697.195,I am in North Seattle community member and educator who is present from North Seattle college.,84,,
280,0.97,1697.195,1714.779,"I would love to tell you that I truly had a personal friendship with representative John Lewis because that would mean I would have had an amazing mentor who fought for the rights of all people to vote, and who worked tirelessly to assure that our children inherit a healthy planet and have many opportunities and have just, and Progressive nations.",84,,
281,0.97,1714.779,1733.465,"What I can tell you is just a few years ago, I had the opportunity to meet and spend time with John Lewis during an American Association of colleges conferences in Washington, D.C. I was part of an affiliate Council of a ACC call the National Council on black American affairs.",84,,
282,0.97,1733.465,1752.517,"Back in those days, they annually sponsored an elaborate display in convention centers, the visitor area to educate conference attendees about lack American affairs, particularly targeted towards educators.",84,,
283,0.97,1754.652,1768.8,"Being in Washington, D.C., we took a chance and reached out to representative Lewis's staff to see if he could simply stop by our booth to do a meet and greet as the booth was normally very popular during this particular annual convention, but being in Washington, D.C., we made every attempt to take it over the top.",84,,
284,0.97,1768.8,1772.203,"Not only did he say yes, but he agreed to sign copies of his latest book.",84,,
285,0.97,1772.203,1778.343,Staff made arrangements to have copies of the book sent over.,84,,
286,0.97,1778.343,1782.747,"He agreed to sit with us and sign copies for those who wanted them, and we were blown away beyond expectations.",84,,
287,0.97,1782.747,1787.519,"Well, it turned out that the drainage company failed to deliver books in a timely manner and he arrived and they did not.",84,,
288,0.97,1787.519,1799.664,"Fortunately, one of his aides borrowed a box of books, however, we were concerned that representative Lewis would show up and leave once he found out the majority of his books had not arrived.",84,,
289,0.97,1799.664,1800.932,"Fortunately, he did not leave.",84,,
290,0.97,1800.932,1819.551,"He signed the books he brought with him and companies--copies of other books, and stayed with us for a few hours, shaking hands, greeting people, discussing public policy and taking photos.",84,,
291,0.97,1819.551,1824.255,"You can imagine we were grinning from ear to ear, and you have probably seen the photo floating around of all of us.",84,,
292,0.97,1824.255,1832.564,We know that there are many politicians who would have made an exit shortly after finding that books or merchandise didn't arrive.,84,,
293,0.97,1832.564,1834.032,Representative Lewis did not do that.,84,,
294,0.97,1834.032,1844.976,He was gracious and generous with his time.,84,,
295,0.97,1844.976,1850.481,"He continually thanked us as educators for doing this work and for staying the course, reminding us that as educators, we are, indeed, causing good trouble.",84,,
296,0.97,1850.481,1863.895,"I was inspired and encouraged by spending that time with him, so hearing this story, you may ask, what does this have to do with naming the bridge after him in North Seattle?",84,,
297,0.97,1863.895,1865.296,Let me share my personal perspective with you.,84,,
298,0.97,1865.296,1871.002,"The legacy that John Lewis has left for this entire country is one of service, not just to or for black people, but for justice for all people.",84,,
299,0.97,1871.002,1887.418,"The voting rights and justice that he, Dr. King and others walked across the independence bridge to defend back in 1965 continues to be manipulated and are in jeopardy today in the 21st century.",84,,
300,0.97,1887.418,1903.668,"We must never forget and never stop crossing bridges to assure equity and justice for all, current and future generations must know this American name and how he helped to ignite a fire by crossing a bridge.",84,,
301,0.97,1903.668,1906.337,Representative Lewis authored a few books in his time here on earth.,84,,
302,0.97,1906.337,1910.241,"One that stands out is entitled to cross that bridge, a vision for change and the future of America.",84,,
303,0.97,1910.241,1921.92,I'm hoping that the bridge being considered today be a bridge that leads anyone who is willing to their own vision of positive change in their lives by seeking out a better life through higher education.,84,,
304,0.97,1921.92,1928.726,"Those heading East on the bridge, I hope they are heading to the light rail to get that job or a place that helps them live a better life and feed children of families.",84,,
305,0.97,1928.726,1945.209,"I am optimistic that this bridge will be a bridge of hope for those who cross it, that it will one day lead to a community that reflects images and the history of all of us, the naming of this bridge after representative John Lewis is a start, and a good start to good trouble.",84,,
306,0.97,1945.209,1954.686,I want the youth in this community to know the names of people who look like me and other Bipoc people who work tirelessly to make this country safe for all of us.,84,,
307,0.97,1954.686,1964.128,"The type of honor being considered today isn't only for a certain part of town or certain neighborhoods, the founding in and of itself is a Micro-Aggression that isn't Micro-At all, frankly.",84,,
308,0.97,1964.128,1972.904,That idea suggests to those who are listening and watching that maybe you don't belong here in history or otherwise.,84,,
309,0.97,1972.904,1978.209,"For America to be that which she was born to be, this way of thinking Sibley cannot stand.",84,,
310,0.97,1978.209,1979.61,I grew up in the 60s.,84,,
311,0.97,1979.61,1983.715,"The legacy of John Lewis and others shaped my Worldview, possibly influenced my decision to become an educator.",84,,
312,0.97,1983.715,1998.629,There are so many who cross the Edmund Pettis bridge in 1965 who absolutely had an impact on future generations.,84,,
313,0.97,1998.629,2003.434,"However, no one described the experience better than representative John Lewis by encouraging us to for the right reasons get into good trouble.",84,,
314,0.97,2003.434,2004.635,Thank you for your time.,84,,
315,0.97,2004.635,2012.944,"Thank you, Dr. Crawford.",85,,
316,0.97,2012.944,2013.344,Very powerful.,85,,
317,0.97,2013.344,2022.687,"Colleagues, we normally give central staff analyst a chance to talk about the legislation.",85,,
318,0.97,2022.687,2027.592,"Calvin chow, I don't know if you have anything you want to talk about with committee members.",85,,
319,0.97,2027.592,2031.062,I know we might have some other questions and comments.,85,,
320,0.97,2031.062,2031.462,No.,86,,
321,0.97,2031.462,2032.93,I'm just here to support the conversation.,86,,
322,0.97,2032.93,2036.901,Thank you.,86,,
323,0.97,2036.901,2037.769,"Okay, great.",87,,
324,0.97,2037.769,2053.584,"Council members, any comments or questions for our guests or for the sponsor?",87,,
325,0.97,2055.253,2055.82,Come member Herbold?,87,,
326,0.97,2055.82,2056.22,"Yes, please.",87,,
327,0.97,2056.22,2057.422,Thank you so much.,88,,
328,0.97,2057.422,2061.559,"I just want to request the prime sponsor, council member Juarez, to add my name as a sponsor of this legislation.",88,,
329,0.97,2061.559,2062.493,Thank you so much.,88,,
330,0.97,2062.493,2064.662,"Really, really appreciate you bringing this forward.",88,,
331,0.97,2064.662,2079.811,I would love it if I could benefit from the research that you have done on the naming conventions in Seattle as broken down by district.,88,,
332,0.97,2079.811,2138.536,"I would love to learn more about what is lacking in district I. I have a constituent who has been, for years now, advocating that we rename Stevens street in district I because of the role of that governor compelling indigenous tribes of Washington by intimidation and forcing the tribes to sign treaties that defeated rights and lands, the fact that this governor imposed martial law to better impose his will on both the native people and whites who opposed his views, and you know, he arranged a brutal campaign against the Yakima tribe and Unjustifiably executed the squalor Stevie--Nisqually chief.",88,,
333,0.97,2138.536,2168.9,So I would love to use the research you have done to help justify writing this wrong I loved hearing about experiences with the great John Lewis.,88,,
334,0.97,2168.9,2181.379,We know that he crossed the Edmund Pettis bridge for the final time when his body was carried across in a Horse-Drawn carriage.,88,,
335,0.97,2181.379,2189.52,"Although this city council can't rename that bridge, I love that we are honoring him with a bridge here in Seattle, so thank you, Councilmember Juarez.",88,,
336,0.97,2189.52,2197.028,"Thank you, absolutely.",89,,

681,0.97,4216.879,4227.79,"Agenda item 8, 120135, an ordinance granting Are-Seattle no.",190,,
682,0.97,4227.79,4244.707,"33 LLC a permit to construct, maintain and operate below grade private utility lines under and across Roy Street West of eighth Avenue North and Dexter Avenue North, North of Mercer street, for a 15 year term, renewable for one successive 15 year term.",190,,
683,0.97,4244.707,4246.342,"It is for briefing, discussion, and possible vote.",190,,
684,0.97,4246.342,4247.142,"Thank you, colleagues.",191,,
685,0.97,4247.142,4269.898,"This bill would grant final approval for a structure term permit to build, operate and maintain private utility tunnels under city streets for a district in South Lake Union, District 7. the tunnels will collect waste heat from public utilities wastewater system and deliver the heat to buildings on three locks planted under development.",191,,
686,0.97,4269.898,4285.014,"These tunnels would run below Dexter Avenue North and Roy street, we can go ahead and welcome back are central staff person, Lish Whitson, thank you.",191,,
687,0.97,4285.014,4288.751,Do you have any comments before we turn it over to Sdot?,191,,
688,0.97,4288.751,4289.051,Sure.,192,,
689,0.97,4289.051,4306.235,"So in December of 2020, council provided the preliminary recommendations supportive of these tunnels, so this is the final approval utilized for 15 years and can be renewed once.",192,,
690,0.97,4306.235,4306.835,Thank you.,193,,
691,0.97,4306.835,4312.741,"And welcome back, Beverly Barnett, this is Lish Whitson, Beverly Barnett show today.",193,,
692,0.97,4312.741,4322.685,We really appreciate all your work to get these peaches--pieces of legislation to us.,193,,
693,0.97,4322.685,4323.886,We appreciate the committee time.,194,,
694,0.97,4323.886,4325.554,So Amy gray is the expert on this.,194,,
695,0.97,4325.554,4340.102,She has a very crisp Powerpoint that will explain the location and the nature of the permit.,194,,
696,0.97,4340.969,4345.874,"Hello, like she said, I am Amy gray.",195,,
697,0.97,4345.874,4348.977,I work for the Seattle Department of transportation on the significant structure of permits.,195,,
698,0.97,4348.977,4349.878,"Again, I want to thank you.",195,,
699,0.97,4349.878,4355.017,"You had a lot of your schedule taken today, so I appreciate the time you are dedicated to hearing from this proposal.",195,,
700,0.97,4355.017,4360.355,"Next slide, please.",195,,
701,0.97,4360.355,4378.14,"So, Plagiarizing Lish as well, we are here to seek a new permit for private utility lines that connect the 601 Dexter Avenue North, the second Avenue Dexter 101 North and the 800 Mercer street, and this is associated with the MEGA block of the Mercer MEGA block.",195,,
702,0.97,4378.14,4378.54,Next step?,195,,
703,0.97,4378.54,4381.21,"So, also as mentioned before, this is a second step in the process.",195,,
704,0.97,4381.21,4385.714,The Council adopted the resolution to provide conceptual approval.,195,,
705,0.97,4385.714,4401.163,The Council bill of the past will do is issue the permit to a re district energy to construct and operate the system.,195,,
706,0.97,4401.163,4407.569,There are some minor changes that were taken out of the proposal for redundant systems.,195,,
707,0.97,4407.569,4420.582,It is now a simple connection covered under the approval.,195,,
708,0.97,4420.582,4425.454,"The Council bill and the ordinance provide terms and conditions of the permit including the annual fee which from 2021 will be 4000, $481.",195,,
709,0.97,4425.454,4426.989,There is a bond associated with it.,195,,
710,0.97,4426.989,4434.797,There is also insurance protections from the city and inspection maintenance requirements for the structure.,195,,
711,0.97,4434.797,4444.173,There is also provisions to protect other utilities that are in the Right-Of-Way with other agencies like Spu and Scl.,195,,
712,0.97,4444.173,4449.411,And then there is also always the restore Right-Of-Way clause.,195,,
713,0.97,4449.411,4450.012,This is a permit.,195,,
714,0.97,4450.012,4459.988,It would cause the Council to revoke the permit.,195,,
715,0.97,4459.988,4464.326,"If that ever happens in the future, which is highly unlikely, the permit holders are obligated to remove and restore the Right-Of-Way.",195,,
716,0.97,4464.326,4472.801,"So the next slide, I'm going to turn over to Todd from district energy to discover the mechanics of the program.",195,,
717,0.97,4472.801,4473.602,Thank you.,196,,
718,0.97,4473.602,4477.239,I appreciate the time and opportunity to talk today about our project.,196,,
719,0.97,4477.239,4488.65,"So, for those of you who are unfamiliar with us, we are a like science developer.",196,,
720,0.97,4488.65,4490.452,We have been in Seattle for almost 20 years.,196,,
721,0.97,4490.452,4492.521,We are now starting to move into South Lake Union.,196,,
722,0.97,4492.521,4501.83,"The buildings that we build have a high demand for outside air, which means they have a high demand for heating, which has traditionally been done by utilization of fossil fuels.",196,,
723,0.97,4501.83,4524.019,"So the system that we have come up with, and the term permit would take that demand and tap into the sewer with a heat Exchanger to harvest waste heat that would supplement 80% of the heating demand in the buildings.",196,,
724,0.97,4524.019,4533.095,"So, another way to say that is taking demand off fossil fuels.",196,,
725,0.97,4533.095,4544.673,"It is a pretty interesting opportunity for us, and I think this is pretty exciting stuff.",196,,
726,0.97,4544.673,4548.51,"The way that the system is designed, 701 Dexter is the first building that is being constructed.",196,,
727,0.97,4548.51,4570.999,"It will have the central plant that taps the sewer in ways we can harvest heat, and the term permit we are requesting allows us to connect each one of the buildings with the condenser loop that COMPLETES the circuit and allows us to move the harvested heat between parcels.",196,,
728,0.97,4570.999,4581.043,Next slide?,197,,
729,0.97,4581.043,4594.756,These are some of the benefits I just talked about with the number of square feet roughly 1.4 million square feet of high energy using life science projects.,197,,
730,0.97,4594.756,4606.034,"There is an estimated annual savings from the system reporting in place, and then the Co2 savings that is anticipated from moving away from fossil fuels.",197,,
731,0.97,4606.034,4616.445,"Next slide, please.",198,,
732,0.97,4619.114,4622.284,"So here, I am wrapping it up, showing you the location in South Lake Union.",198,,
733,0.97,4622.284,4627.155,"It is in district 7 and associated with the Mercer MEGA block as I mentioned before, and that is the end of the presentation.",198,,
734,0.97,4627.155,4629.391,And I am here to answer questions and so is Todd.,198,,
735,0.97,4629.391,4631.46,Thank you very much.,199,,
736,0.97,4631.46,4636.898,Thank you for the thorough conditions he placed on this project.,199,,
737,0.97,4636.898,4637.966,Council member Morales?,199,,
738,0.97,4637.966,4640.769,Thank you.,200,,
739,0.97,4640.769,4645.874,I will admit this is--I have got some basic questions.,200,,
740,0.97,4645.874,4651.58,Maybe this is for Lish.,200,,
741,0.97,4651.58,4672.3,"But I am interested in, first of all, just understanding where Spu stands on this project, and what cost, if any, the city would incur for operation of a public utility?",200,,
742,0.97,4672.3,4674.002,"Do you want me to answer, Lish?",201,,
743,0.97,4674.002,4675.303,I can talk about the cost.,201,,
744,0.97,4675.303,4679.207,There is no cost to the city to operate this.,201,,
745,0.97,4679.207,4683.812,"Actually, we get revenue in the amount of about $4000 a year.",201,,
746,0.97,4683.812,4713.108,"Term permits are required to pay to the city an annual fee for the private occupation for the Right-Of-Way, the Council adopted a methodology that sets all term permits, it takes the land value and also multiplies it sort of on the privatization occupation reduction of public use for traveling public since it is low-grade.",201,,
747,0.97,4713.108,4716.344,The factor is not huge.,201,,
748,0.97,4716.344,4718.346,So they are required to pay a fee every year.,201,,
749,0.97,4718.346,4720.582,There is no cost to the city.,201,,
750,0.97,4720.582,4733.161,It is probably worth noting where we harvest the heat is King County and the structure.,202,,
751,0.97,4733.161,4735.063,Okay.,203,,
752,0.97,4735.063,4742.037,"So, do you charge tenants in the building for use of this service?",203,,
753,0.97,4742.037,4748.877,"So the way to think about this system is, it is similar to when a building has solar panels on it.",204,,
754,0.97,4748.877,4749.878,It is part of the building.,204,,
755,0.97,4749.878,4751.48,The tenant is an occupant in the building.,204,,
756,0.97,4751.48,4770.198,"You know, they are essentially leasing from us a certain amount of utility, and in this scenario, we are creating a utility through the heat recovery system and District energy.",204,,
757,0.97,4770.198,4770.465,Okay.,205,,
758,0.97,4770.465,4776.605,Is there anyone from Spu on here?,205,,
759,0.97,4776.605,4779.908,Just curious.,205,,
760,0.97,4779.908,4794.322,"As part of the construction from it, if I am correct, it is issued by Sdot for the construction and everything that has to happen in the infrastructure right away.",206,,
761,0.97,4794.322,4796.158,They do coordinate--all the construction work with Spu.,206,,
762,0.97,4796.158,4801.83,I'm not sure if that addresses your question or if it is checking with Spu.,206,,
763,0.97,4801.83,4811.039,They are part of the engineer drawings.,206,,
764,0.97,4811.039,4814.142,You said it is King County infrastructure.,207,,
765,0.97,4814.142,4823.585,"The King County infrastructure, however, we have pulled permits through as DCI which requires coordination with Spu.",208,,
766,0.97,4823.585,4828.456,So they are in the Loop on this at multiple levels.,208,,
767,0.97,4828.456,4845.574,"If I may, one more question--can you talk about what, if any, liability that the city has, if there is an issue with that?",209,,
768,0.97,4845.574,4855.483,"Yeah, the term that the Council has before you, all the obligations and protections that the city requires.",210,,
769,0.97,4855.483,4876.805,"As far as the physical integrity of it, they are required to submit inspections every 2 years, certified inspection engineer, then on the alternate years, the city does an initial check in with them to make sure there is nothing changed substantially.",210,,
770,0.97,4876.805,4893.255,"If there is a natural disaster event, they are required to address the system, and let Sdot know what, if anything, [Indiscernible] damage to the system.",210,,
771,0.97,4893.255,4899.027,"We have the ordinance bond, $15,000, that is in place for the life of the project.",210,,
772,0.97,4899.027,4908.937,"So with the AR E, it likes to walk away from the project and structures are still there.",210,,
773,0.97,4908.937,4918.079,"We keep the bond, to cover the cost of Sdot and the city going out and removing them from the Right-Of-Way and restoring it into the current conditions.",210,,
774,0.97,4918.079,4936.765,"In another protection the city has, the insurance, we have a very strict insurance requirement that is determined for all term Templates for the city, risk management gives that--this is the language.",210,,
775,0.97,4936.765,4952.38,"I don't know a lot of Insurane language technical terms, but basically, it protects the city as additional insured--so we have a number of other checks within the ordinance that minimize the risk to the city.",210,,
776,0.97,4952.38,4960.889,[Indiscernible],210,,
777,0.97,4960.889,4967.696,"And the conditions that Amy mentioned, there is a requirement they have a duty to defend the city against lawsuits and hold the city harmless.",211,,
778,0.97,4967.696,4967.962,Yes.,212,,
779,0.97,4967.962,4968.396,Thank you.,212,,
780,0.97,4968.396,4980.408,"Another thing I would add to show our commitment, so, during preconstruction, we were approached by a number of groups that wanted to partner with us and own this system.",213,,
781,0.97,4980.408,4984.512,"And Alexandria actually decided, no, we want to on the system.",213,,
782,0.97,4984.512,4985.914,It is the right thing to do.,213,,
783,0.97,4985.914,4986.981,We are long-term holders.,213,,
784,0.97,4986.981,4990.618,We are a big part of the city.,213,,
785,0.97,4990.618,4993.888,We are doing this to help build life science.,213,,
786,0.97,4993.888,5006.835,We didn't want to pollute the idea or the concept with a private utility provider that was offering some pretty interesting proposals to us.,213,,
787,0.97,5006.835,5034.262,"And the ordinance, if they are selling the building to a successful entity, there are provisions that specify the same obligations that were [Indiscernible] are applicable to any subsequent property holder and they have to abide by all the same levels of protection.",214,,
788,0.97,5034.262,5035.897,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales for the questions.",215,,
789,0.97,5035.897,5053.314,"I know when this was first proposed, people were excited about the reduction of fossil fuel use, and we need to make sure the city is protected in case anything goes wrong so we appreciate the city staff and central staff staying focused on those.",215,,
790,0.97,5053.314,5074.302,Take those into the document to protect us in a number of different situations that could happen in a negative way but--also excited about this information to see if we can reduce the fossil fuel use in a sustainable way so thank you very much.,215,,
791,0.97,5074.302,5077.705,"Council members, any other questions about this?",215,,
792,0.97,5077.705,5084.612,Just checking--see if any hands are raised--okay.,215,,
793,0.97,5084.612,5092.954,"Council members, I would like to now move that the committee commend passage of Council bill 120135, item 8 on the agenda.",215,,
794,0.97,5092.954,5096.224,Is there a second?,215,,
795,0.97,5096.224,5096.825,Second.,216,,

799,0.97,5106.334,5106.568,Okay.,217,,
800,0.97,5106.568,5113.641,Will the clerk please call the role on the committee recommendation the bill be approved forwarding to the full council?,217,,

816,0.97,5146.574,5161.389,"Just a heads up, depending on who calls in for the public hearing, what the comments are, I may likely ask we suspend the rules and vote on the item because it is accepting properties that have already been purchased, protect ownership, but we can talk about that further.",231,,
817,0.97,5161.389,5163.691,I just wanted committee members to have a heads up on that.,231,,
818,0.97,5163.691,5169.998,Will the clerk please read the short title--the ninth agenda item into the record?,231,,
819,0.97,5169.998,5204.265,"Agenda item 9, council bill 120146, an ordinance relating to the city light Department; accepting statutory warranty deeds to the Beeson, Brecht, Chen, Crosson, Fresonke, Judd, Marsall, Mcelfresh (two properties), Metzler and de Llaguno, and Rasmussen properties in Skagit County, Washington, and the ring family limited partnership property in Snohomish County, all for Salmonid habitat protection purposes; declaring certain real property rights surplus and no longer required for providing public utility service or other municipal purposes, and ratifying the grants of deeds of right to the state of Washington on the Beeson, Brecht, Chen, Fresonke, Judd, Marblemount LLC, Mcelfresh properties, and Rasmussen for salmon recovery and conservation purposes; placing said lands under the jurisdiction of the city light Department; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",232,,
820,0.97,5204.265,5212.373,For briefing and possible vote.,232,,
821,0.97,5212.373,5213.041,Thank you.,233,,
822,0.97,5213.041,5222.35,These numerous items are part of Seattle city light's obligation for the endangered species Act and committed to contribute to conservation of salmon and Trout Habitats in the Skagit watersheds.,233,,
823,0.97,5222.35,5224.419,These deeds are along those rivers.,233,,
824,0.97,5224.419,5236.831,"The city's funding is frequently combined with grant funds to increase the positive impact, acceptance of these deeds is a formal step to the process.",233,,
825,0.97,5236.831,5244.272,"And again, depending on the content of any public hearing speakers, I will likely ask many members to vote on this item today.",233,,
826,0.97,5244.272,5248.776,I will make the appropriate motion to suspend the rules to do that.,233,,
827,0.97,5248.776,5259.087,"We can go ahead--we can have the public hearing first, or after.",233,,
828,0.97,5259.087,5260.421,I don't actually see any speakers.,233,,
829,0.97,5260.421,5262.123,I will need to open and close the public hearing.,233,,
830,0.97,5262.123,5266.194,Why don't we go ahead and have the presentation first to see if anybody wants to call in?,233,,
831,0.97,5266.194,5278.206,"So, we will go ahead and welcome Seattle city light and also Council central staff, Eric Mcconaghy is here.",233,,
832,0.97,5278.206,5281.843,"Eric, did you want to have opening comments before we turn it over to Seattle city light?",233,,
833,0.97,5281.843,5282.844,"Thank you, chair Pederson.",234,,
834,0.97,5282.844,5285.513,Good morning.,234,,
835,0.97,5285.513,5303.197,"Here at central staff, I would mention the reason why this ordinance for the committee which will move to the full Council and set the city charter requires that the city accept property through legislation through an ordinance.",234,,
836,0.97,5303.197,5318.813,"Because of that, while the previous law gave them the ability to purchase properties, this is the final move in that fashion.",234,,
837,0.97,5318.813,5321.449,"And then, the public hearing today is because of some of these properties.",234,,
838,0.97,5321.449,5337.298,"Deeds are required for the state of Washington to protect the property in Perpetuity and keeping with grant funding that was received by city light in use of the property so that's why the public hearing is happening--other than that, just covering more that you already covered, chair Pederson.",234,,
839,0.97,5337.298,5341.569,"With that, I will let it go--Yeah.",234,,
840,0.97,5341.569,5343.137,Thank you very much for your metal.,235,,
841,0.97,5343.137,5347.475,Úthat was helpful to dig into all these documents and summarize for the city Council and the public.,235,,
842,0.97,5347.475,5351.913,So thank you for that excellent memo for us.,235,,
843,0.97,5351.913,5352.513,You are welcome.,236,,
844,0.97,5352.513,5356.818,"Also, we are delighted to see our general manager here.",237,,
845,0.97,5356.818,5368.162,"Debra Smith, general manager Smith, please take it away.",237,,
846,0.97,5369.664,5370.598,Thank you so much.,238,,
847,0.97,5370.598,5372.233,I am having a technology challenged day today.,238,,
848,0.97,5372.233,5373.634,You all keep sneaking up on me.,238,,
849,0.97,5373.634,5379.574,"I will not say much except, yes, this is an acceptance of previous properties purchased.",238,,
850,0.97,5379.574,5382.41,It is part of an exciting program that was part of our last license.,238,,
851,0.97,5382.41,5390.118,I am excited.,238,,
852,0.97,5390.118,5395.089,"Denise who I had the opportunity to work with quite a lot at city lights, she is a leader of the Seattle silence breakers.",238,,
853,0.97,5395.089,5396.958,She is the woman in charge of this program.,238,,
854,0.97,5396.958,5397.825,That is super cool.,238,,
855,0.97,5397.825,5401.929,So I will turn it over to her before I freeze up and--and--I get stuck mid sentence.,238,,
856,0.97,5401.929,5405.032,"So take it away, team.",238,,
857,0.97,5405.032,5408.836,I'm looking for it to be Supercool now.,239,,
858,0.97,5408.836,5411.639,"Hopefully, we can deliver on that.",240,,
859,0.97,5411.639,5414.542,"So, good morning, everyone.",240,,
860,0.97,5414.542,5428.089,Thank you for being able to come before the committee today to Presentthis.,240,,
861,0.97,5428.089,5437.098,"I will be talking about the endangered species act on the properties we purchased, and Mara, if you can proceed with the next slide, that would be great.",240,,
862,0.97,5437.098,5458.119,"Just a quick overview, I will give you some background on the Esa early actual program itself and then Delve into some of the specifics about this ordinance and then present a few photographs of some properties that have been purchased under this program and then answer any questions that you may have.",240,,
863,0.97,5459.854,5469.931,"And--so for background, the endangered species act or Esa land program began in 2000 with the Esa listing of Chinook, salmon and Bull Trout as threatened in Puget sound.",240,,
864,0.97,5469.931,5471.599,In the city developed an entire program about it.,240,,
865,0.97,5471.599,5476.938,And this portion of the program focuses on fish habitat in the watersheds in the city light purchase properties.,240,,
866,0.97,5476.938,5482.643,-- to protect fish habitat for those species in those watersheds.,240,,
867,0.97,5482.643,5497.792,"And, when the initial Skagit license was made in 1995, there were no listed fish species in the watershed.",240,,
868,0.97,5497.792,5532.693,"Since then, there are now three because Steelhead were also listed in 2007 and so when the gorge to tunnel project was being done several years ago back in the early 2010S, the city went forward with trying to get coverage under the endangered species act because we didn't have that when the special license first came out and so a portion of this program that Esa lands program is to cover for that mitigation until we have this now, the upcoming, upcoming Skagit license what is going on.",240,,
869,0.97,5532.693,5559.12,"And essentially, what mitigation these lands provide is to help mitigate impacts on any spotting or rearing habitat for these species and since the program's inception, we covered 3700 acres being protected and that has been funded through $5.9 million in city light funds and $5.2 million in grant funds from multiple sources.",240,,
870,0.97,5559.12,5563.391,"Okay, Mara, thank you.",240,,
871,0.97,5563.391,5636.897,"And then, specifically, to this ordinance before you this year, it includes the purchase of 12 properties totaling 278 acres in the watershed that were purchased from 2017 to 2020 and then accepting the deeds which are required by the grant and the deeds of right essentially stayed that the city will protect the property with its habitat conditions and since that was what the purpose of the Esa program was, that is something we feel is very acceptable to do and the only requirement being that if we were to sell the properties, we would need to purchase a similar property to substitute for that but that is not the intent of this program and these deeds of right to protect the liberties and Gratuity and so for these 12 properties they were funded by $624,000 in city light funds and $175,000 in salmon recovery refining board which is a Washington state grant funding over the years of the purchase.",240,,
872,0.97,5636.897,5638.566,Next slide?,240,,
873,0.97,5638.566,5647.875,So this is to give you an idea of where the Skagit watershed properties have been purchased.,240,,
874,0.97,5647.875,5650.778,They are directly tied to the properties before you today in the deed acceptance ordinance.,240,,
875,0.97,5650.778,5667.995,The other properties in red are properties previously purchased under USA lands program and then properties in yellow are representing wildlife lands properties that were purchased--and that is part of the Skagit mitigation program.,240,,
876,0.97,5667.995,5689.316,"And with that, Mara, if you go to the next slide--this property is one that was purchased previously, but it is very similar to the marvel LLC property that is in this ordinance and it is a Skagit Mainstem property.",240,,
877,0.97,5689.316,5698.859,And we are trying to give folks a feel of the different type of properties we purchase and the different waters we purchase properties on and--and--you can't see it.,240,,
878,0.97,5698.859,5724.452,"I guess it is off the screen, but this and the next two photographs are taken by Keith Lizzo and these are his professional photographs that we hired him to do because I can't take this kind of picture with any camera that I could ever be given so--Mara, next picture, please.",240,,
879,0.97,5724.452,5738.299,"Then this is Preston Creek which is representative of the Judd property because that is on Preston Creek--again, this is a much smaller body of water obviously compared to the Skagit and the Mainstem Skagit and next slide--this last picture is the Rasmus property which is on the Cascade River.",240,,
880,0.97,5738.299,5749.877,"Obviously, another Mainstem River but nowhere near as large as the Skagit River, and with that, I would be happy to take any questions you all may have.",240,,
881,0.97,5749.877,5751.078,Thank you very much.,241,,
882,0.97,5751.078,5753.214,Thank you for purchasing the properties.,241,,
883,0.97,5753.214,5759.587,We are here to prove the statutory warrant in deeds.,241,,
884,0.97,5759.587,5763.691,I can go ahead and open and close the public hearing.,241,,
885,0.97,5763.691,5769.53,That might help us decide whether we have any questions.,241,,
886,0.97,5769.53,5778.706,"So Council members, if there is no objection, I will open the public hearing for this item.",241,,
887,0.97,5778.706,5780.708,And I am saying we don't have any new speakers.,241,,
888,0.97,5780.708,5782.543,We don't have any speakers for this at all.,241,,
889,0.97,5782.543,5792.52,"But I do need to formally open and close the public hearing at first, folks from the information technology team, you also see no speakers signed up for the public hearing?",241,,
890,0.97,5792.52,5796.557,There are no public hearing registrants.,242,,
891,0.97,5796.557,5801.028,"Okay, thank you.",243,,
892,0.97,5801.028,5804.064,"So, I'm going to go ahead and open and close public hearing.",243,,
893,0.97,5804.064,5812.64,"Before I open the public hearing, I remind the public it's the same procedures we use for regular public comments.",243,,
894,0.97,5812.64,5821.749,"If people have two minutes to speak, I start at 6:00, we have a 10 second morning.",243,,
895,0.97,5821.749,5826.053,The public hearing on this bill is now open.,243,,
896,0.97,5826.053,5829.89,And we have confirmed there are no speakers signed up.,243,,
897,0.97,5829.89,5835.362,So I will go ahead and close the public hearing on 120146.,243,,
898,0.97,5835.362,5836.564,It is now closed.,243,,
899,0.97,5836.564,5844.104,And people can still write to us at Council @ Seattle.Gov.,243,,
900,0.97,5844.104,5848.909,We will move to vote this out of committee today.,243,,
901,0.97,5848.909,5851.812,But there will still be time before it is voted on in full council.,243,,
902,0.97,5851.812,5855.282,People have comments on this.,243,,
903,0.97,5855.282,5856.884,"So, turn it back to Council members.",243,,
904,0.97,5856.884,5862.99,"Yes, Councilmember Morales?",243,,
905,0.97,5862.99,5863.39,Thank you.,244,,
906,0.97,5863.39,5903.831,"I just took a tour of the Cedar River watershed with some folks from the light and Sbu and so it just RAISES a question for me about what conversations you have had with tribes about the transfer of property, fishing rights, all the access to the land, just curious how that process works, if you could talk about that a little bit?",244,,
907,0.97,5903.831,5904.431,Absolutely.,245,,
908,0.97,5904.431,6016.577,"In the Skagit watershed where the properties were purchased, we are part of the Skagit watershed Council and there is an entire protection strategy that was developed that essentially Prioritizes properties for purchase and the three Skagit oriented tribes have all--are all members of the Skagit watershed Council and participated in the development of the protection strategy so these are essentially approved through the strategy and then through the hierarchy and the process of the Skagit watershed Council before by purchaser property particularly since these are with grant funds, it goes to the protection Committee at the Skagit watershed Council and then it goes to--and there are tribal representatives on that--then it goes to the technical Committee for their approval--again, tribal representation on that, and again, it gets voted on for the full watershed Council and again--I believe--yes, there is currently representation by the tribes on the Skagit watershed Council board so that--that's that process and then we also just threw--I am very much work with several of the tribes and tribal organizations on Skagit and work with them on restoration of these properties and so usually when we are looking at a particular area, I will reach out to--because most of them are restoration oriented and I will ask them, Hey, what are your thoughts on this because we have to look at it since we are going to be managing the properties of how that would be as a long-term cost and so trying to get their ideas on if there is something that is readily manageable for us and how we can fit it in with future projects and we have done that also certainly one of our other projects became one of a mitigation project that Skagit County needed to do for some illegal fill that they did during a flooding event and Skagit River system Co-op and the soonest tribe in particular were very helpful in doing that in particular and that took place on one of our Esa lands!",245,,
909,0.97,6016.577,6017.344,Thank you.,246,,
910,0.97,6017.344,6024.051,"Council members, any questions on this item?",246,,
911,0.97,6024.051,6037.664,"Council members, because we had no public hearing speakers on this,--Council member hurtled high?",246,,
912,0.97,6037.664,6039.5,I'm so slow on the draw this morning.,247,,
913,0.97,6039.5,6039.9,I'm sorry.,247,,
914,0.97,6039.9,6055.382,"Just as you are ready to move things on--okay--here I am--thank you so much--so just a quick question, the right to use documents indicated that those right to use documents were signed, some of them as early--many of them as early as 2017.",247,,
915,0.97,6055.382,6073.0,"Can you just--can I explain why--it seems like--is that the end of the property negotiation process, and if so, why is it taking so long to get these to Council?",247,,
916,0.97,6073.0,6087.448,"So part of using grant funds is that we also are required to provide match for grant funds, and some of the properties we purchase, marble LLC is one of them.",248,,
917,0.97,6087.448,6102.262,"It is a pretty large property and has an upland section that doesn't qualify for the grant funds, but we are using funds towards the purchase of the property, forgive me, my dog is barking in the background.",248,,
918,0.97,6102.262,6112.906,"So, with that, any additional funds that city light puts towards a purchase can be used as match toward current or future grant.",248,,
919,0.97,6112.906,6139.867,"So to maximize the leverage of the city light dollars, which helps leverage other dollars in the Basin, we wait to formalize and record the deed, so we have essentially assigned the money to grants, and some of the grants just happened.",248,,
920,0.97,6139.867,6142.136,"Once that is finally done, we bring forward the deed of rights.",248,,
921,0.97,6142.136,6148.909,That's why that one in particular is so late because I believe it got matched to 5 grants which is a record I am proud of so --,248,,
922,0.97,6148.909,6150.377,Thank you for the explanation.,249,,
923,0.97,6150.377,6150.944,That makes perfect sense.,249,,
924,0.97,6150.944,6180.14,"Certainly--and I did realize that Councilmember Morales question for tribes, also--our lands are public and we have--they are hoping for hunting and fishing during legal seasons and we do work with the tribes and the state, particularly with the tribes to allow in particular hunting because it has been harder to find open hunting areas for tribal members in the Skagit Valley so I'm sorry I missed that portion of your question earlier.",250,,
925,0.97,6180.14,6180.507,Thank you.,251,,

959,0.97,6316.209,6324.551,"At the end, the auditor had a separate opinion for each of the funds and found no significant deficiencies.",267,,
960,0.97,6324.551,6331.391,We do have the city said--central staff here.,267,,
961,0.97,6331.391,6343.57,"Before we turn it over to the auditors, just to offer central staff if they want to say anything to Intro.",267,,
962,0.97,6343.57,6345.172,"Council member, I don't have any remarks.",268,,
963,0.97,6345.172,6345.806,Take it away.,268,,
964,0.97,6345.806,6347.007,Okay.,269,,
965,0.97,6347.007,6348.475,Thank you.,269,,
966,0.97,6348.475,6348.909,Welcome.,269,,
967,0.97,6348.909,6356.883,Please go ahead.,269,,
968,0.97,6356.883,6358.185,Good morning.,270,,
969,0.97,6358.185,6359.019,I am Todd Ryland.,270,,
970,0.97,6359.019,6363.09,I'm the senior manager on the engagements for the Audits for Seattle public utilities.,270,,
971,0.97,6363.09,6370.197,And I believe there is a presentation to go with this.,270,,
972,0.97,6370.197,6374.835,"Is somebody sharing, or do I need to share it?",270,,
973,0.97,6374.835,6376.269,"Normally, you would share it.",271,,
974,0.97,6376.269,6382.142,"Yeah, I can do that.",272,,
975,0.97,6382.142,6392.352,One second.,272,,
976,0.97,6394.221,6394.554,Perfect.,272,,
977,0.97,6394.554,6400.327,"So, as I mentioned, I am Todd Ryland.",272,,
978,0.97,6400.327,6411.238,Reporting on our audit of the financial statements for the funds for Seattle public utilities.,272,,
979,0.97,6411.238,6436.563,"So the purpose of our Audits, the financial statements of Spu are used by the Washington state auditor's office in their evaluation of the cities financial statements, and this is a way we can avoid duplication of efforts so SPF does not have to go through and audit with us as well as well as the auditors office--the office is able to rely on our work, there.",272,,
980,0.97,6436.563,6463.49,"As I mentioned, the financial statements are rolled up into the confidential financial report, and the audit opinions for each of the funds are used in official statements for [Indiscernible]. they can also be available to other Stakeholders if needed, and I also want to note, I have a thank you slide at the very end, but with the help of Spu's employees and management was very instrumental this year.",272,,
981,0.97,6463.49,6497.757,"We had a couple bond Issuances that were coming up, we had an accelerated Timeline to deliver the reports and very big thank you to the Spu employees and team for being very responsive on all requests to help facilitate that to get us through our items so we can get the Audits out a little bit early this year.",272,,
982,0.97,6497.757,6503.43,"So the scope of our Audits as chair Pederson mentioned, we have a separate audit for each of the utilities, water, wastewater, and solid waste Fund.",272,,
983,0.97,6503.43,6516.643,Spu management is responsible for the fair presentation of the financial statements.,272,,
984,0.97,6516.643,6522.983,"Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statement, specifically whether or not they are presented fairly and all material respects and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.",272,,
985,0.97,6522.983,6545.505,"When we say in all material respects, we have this Council of Materiality which is this number we establish in the planning phase of what is an amount that may impact the decision-making of the users of the financial statements, so to that regard, there are certain things in the items that might be slightly off.",272,,
986,0.97,6545.505,6554.014,We don't necessarily look into every single item because that would be cost prohibitive so that is what I am referring to when I say within all material respects.,272,,
987,0.97,6554.014,6583.009,"Additionally, we test certain systems with infrastructure of controls and we rely on the controls that are in place to also help us reduce the number of substandard procedures we need to perform so if there is a strong controlled structure in place as there is with Spu then that is also able to help the audit run a bit more efficiently.",272,,
988,0.97,6583.009,6587.547,"So reports issued, we had unmodified opinions for each of the separate funds.",272,,
989,0.97,6587.547,6592.485,"As chair Pederson mentioned, the unmodified opinion is what you might call a clean audit opinion.",272,,
990,0.97,6592.485,6604.564,"We also issued reports on the control matters that we had no material weaknesses, no significant deficiencies in the current year.",272,,
991,0.97,6604.564,6616.776,"Additionally, as part of audit procedures, any significant issues we feel would merit Council's attention, we would provide written recommendations and happy there are no written recommendations for this year.",272,,
992,0.97,6616.776,6634.26,"There were one or two small recommendations that were--if you will, best practices suggestions that have been communicated to management, but nothing significant, nothing that would merit the attention of Council.",272,,
993,0.97,6634.26,6662.689,"So, Audits are structured with a Risk-Based approach so we look at the areas it is most likely the statement will occur, and we look at those areas through a little bit tighter lens and take a closer look at them so these are some of the areas that we looked at in more detail.",272,,
994,0.97,6662.689,6681.408,"The largest areas on there that we spend the most time with are the utility plant and related accounts as well as the bonds and related accounts and the regulatory assets, the assets and liabilities for those accounts, but all these areas do merit special attention, if you will, to go through the audit work.",272,,
995,0.97,6681.408,6700.96,"Within those accounts and financial statements, there are some significant estimates, as you can imagine, estimates require some input and judgment on the part of management to record those assets and liabilities, so we also look at those with a little bit more scrutiny.",272,,
996,0.97,6700.96,6731.558,"Some of the more important ones, the allowance for accounts, accounts receivable and how much of those are actually collectible as well as the recovery periods for a utility plant which would be how many years is a particular asset going to be depreciated over as well as the environmental remediation costs and estimates, and finally, the Postemployment benefit obligations and pension liabilities.",272,,
997,0.97,6731.558,6745.772,"So, I touched on this briefly before, but the audit standards require that we communicate certain items to you as those [Indiscernible] over utilities.",272,,
998,0.97,6745.772,6762.822,"So our responsibility as the auditors is to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared by management with your oversight, fairly presented in all material respects.",272,,
999,0.97,6762.822,6771.698,"So even though we are performing the audit, it does not relieve you or management of your responsibility for the preparation or oversight of those statements.",272,,
1000,0.97,6771.698,6810.637,"Additionally, our Audits are performed in accordance with auditing standards and making sure these are presented in accordance with the standards [Indiscernible] governmental accounting standards and is performed according to the government auditing standards as issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, an important thing to note is that our design is designed--our audit is designed to obtain reasonable rather than absolute assurance, and this goes back to the concept of Materiality.",272,,
1001,0.97,6810.637,6820.947,"If we were trying to obtain absolute assurance, there is just no Cost-Benefit scenario that would make that feasible.",272,,
1002,0.97,6820.947,6830.056,"So to that point, we have focused on riskier areas and we rely on statistical sampling to get to that reasonable level of assurance.",272,,
1003,0.97,6830.056,6831.925,We also consider the interim controls over financial reporting.,272,,
1004,0.97,6831.925,6856.482,"We do not Express an opinion on the effectiveness of those controls, however, as I mentioned, we can use our understanding of those controls and understanding of those controls to--Customize our audit approach and make it more efficient.",272,,
1005,0.97,6856.482,6864.624,"And then, finally, what we are doing with this presentation right here, we are going to communicate our findings and judgment are relevant to your responsibilities for oversight.",272,,
1006,0.97,6864.624,6902.562,"So, specific matters to be communicated our Audits were performed according to the timing as provided by the consultant agreement, Additionally, significant accounting policies that are used by Spu are disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements and we noted there were no changes to accounting policies during the year either in their application as well as no new standards that were implemented during the year and then Finally, the exclusions were clear and understandable.",272,,
1007,0.97,6902.562,6930.056,"Required to communicate significant difficulties encountered during the audit as well as [Indiscernible] we are pleased to report we had neither of those during the year, no disagreements or significant difficulties--if we find any material statements, whether or not they are corrected or uncorrected in the final financial statements, we are required to communicate those as well.",272,,
1008,0.97,6930.056,6932.859,"Again, we had no material statements that were identified in the current year.",272,,
1009,0.97,6932.859,6941.234,"As far as we are aware, management cannot consult with other accountants and there were no other significant issues that arose during the Audits.",272,,
1010,0.97,6941.234,6971.23,"And again, thank you to the Spu team and their involvement and prompt attention to matters that are instrumental in getting the Audits done early this year and we just Notated the talk of attitude from management was open and collaborative and--it--it was also very instrumental in helping us to achieve efficient Audits this year so--that is all I have.",272,,
1011,0.97,6971.23,6974.934,I'm here for questions as well if anybody has them on the financial statements or my presentation.,272,,
1012,0.97,6974.934,6980.206,Thank you very much.,273,,
1013,0.97,6980.206,6988.915,"Council members, as you may recall, we enjoyed similar results for Seattle city light.",273,,
1014,0.97,6988.915,7027.086,"This physical responsibility from both city-owned utilities is a positive impact on hundreds of thousands of people in Seattle, clean Audits help us earn high marks from the bond and rating agencies which result in lower interest rates for debt and capital projects so these infra structure heavy operations in turn generates cost savings that can pass on the rate payers since utility rates are Regressive, this is very important [Indiscernible] incomes that have lower income pay a higher portion for utility bills so this work is very important so--any questions about the audit results here on the three lines of business--member Herbold?",273,,
1015,0.97,7027.086,7038.631,"Yeah, just a Formatting or structuring question, chair Pederson, you are doing things differently and more efficiently.",274,,
1016,0.97,7038.631,7052.745,"When I was chair of the committee with Spu oversight, Los Angeles used to come to us with an opening report--I think it was called an entrance report--afterwards, an exit report.",274,,
1017,0.97,7052.745,7074.233,"That was--I structured the many discussions that way because it was recommended we do it that way at the time so just wondering if that's--if that's changed, or is this just a matter of being more efficient with our committee time?",274,,
1018,0.97,7074.233,7088.081,"I think that might have been related to Covid and the suspension of committee meetings during the extra budget process we had last year as well, so I think that we just didn't do it for that reason.",275,,
1019,0.97,7088.081,7088.314,Yes.,276,,
1020,0.97,7088.314,7099.158,"I know the exit presentation last year ended up--we were delaying it, delaying it, delaying it.",276,,
1021,0.97,7099.158,7101.427,One of the options we have is to provide a letter.,276,,
1022,0.97,7101.427,7116.609,"Last year's exit ended up being a more formalized letter to the committee, and then, we had the same approach last fall with our entrance.",276,,
1023,0.97,7116.609,7127.854,"We just couldn't quite squeeze into the agenda schedule so we provided an entrance letter, but we wanted to make sure to show up to provide an exit presentation as you mentioned, it has been a little while since we have gotten the chance to come directly to you.",276,,
1024,0.97,7127.854,7141.267,"Perfect, again, please, not with the findings, but I am always happy to see the tone at the top reference as it relates to this work that you do.",277,,
1025,0.97,7141.267,7141.567,Thank you.,277,,
1026,0.97,7141.567,7144.704,Thank you.,278,,
1027,0.97,7144.704,7152.879,"Council members, any questions for the independent auditor from the Seattle public utilities financial books?",278,,
1028,0.97,7152.879,7153.145,Great.,278,,
1029,0.97,7153.145,7155.181,"Well thank you for being with us, today.",278,,
1030,0.97,7155.181,7158.084,"Todd, appreciate it.",278,,
1031,0.97,7158.084,7158.918,[Indiscernible],279,,
1032,0.97,7158.918,7168.494,Thank you.,280,,
1033,0.97,7168.494,7170.53,"Council members, that was the last item on our agenda.",280,,
1034,0.97,7170.53,7174.867,"So if there is nothing else for the good of the order, I will go ahead and conclude the meeting.",280,,
1035,0.97,7174.867,7179.906,Thank you!,281,,
