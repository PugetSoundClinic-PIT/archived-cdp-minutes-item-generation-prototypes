442,0.8614312410354614,2214.2,2217.4,This is just saying that there would be a community meeting there.,,,
443,0.8614312410354614,2217.4,2226.8,"Be at least one community meeting, which is something that is very helpful to educate the neighborhood on what's Happening.",,,
444,0.8614312410354614,2227.2,2228.0,I think people,,,
445,0.797534167766571,2228.3,2232.3, My experience has been the more people are made aware of these projects.,,,
446,0.797534167766571,2232.3,2239.7,"The more comfortable, they are with them and they welcomed their neighbors and it's a positive result.",,,
447,0.797534167766571,2240.8,2243.4,So it's just saying we just need to have one community meeting.,,,
448,0.797534167766571,2243.5,2257.0,"Its, I think there are minimum and then the third amendment is taking the language from the original draft, which says",,,
449,0.9128382205963135,2258.0,2264.3, Permanent Supportive Housing means multi-family residential use which may include accessory Human Services.,,,
450,0.9128382205963135,2264.9,2266.8,It's really just changing that.,,,
451,0.9128382205963135,2266.8,2282.9,"So we wanted to originally use the word shall so just so we're clearly defining what it is, but we work with city attorney's office, and we Wordsmith this to what it says today, which is paired with on, or off site, voluntary Human Services.",,,
452,0.7937244772911072,2284.0,2289.3," So, it's really just more firmly defining, what we're talking about with permanent Supportive Housing.",,,
453,0.7937244772911072,2289.3,2292.1,"So those are my three amendments happening, answer questions or?",,,

491,0.8536509275436401,2416.6,2420.9,"Is the use, and this gets into some of the weird structure, that is the land, use code.",,,
492,0.8536509275436401,2420.9,2431.8,"So the the city regulates a few things through the land, use code, one is a use which has an activity that happens on a site, a residential uses residential activity on a side.",,,

506,0.8744215965270996,2476.2,2477.1, Excellent.,,,

513,0.8917509913444519,2503.6,2512.7,So that's the recital related to the intent to consider future amendments around Broadband infrastructure.,,,
514,0.8917509913444519,2512.7,2515.9,"So, okay.",,,
515,0.9128382205963135,2516.4,2520.0, I recognize it's in a recital but it does State legislative intent.,,,
516,0.9128382205963135,2520.0,2546.0,"And so, I just want to, I'm obviously supportive of this effort, to have more Broadband infrastructure throughout the season, throughout the city, but I'm also really wanting to make sure that we aren't unintentionally adding additional burdens, or, or criteria to, to developers in their effort to quickly build permanent supportive.",,,
517,0.7910082340240479,2546.2,2549.8, Housing and my understanding that Broadband in my understanding is a Broadband.,,,
518,0.7910082340240479,2549.8,2556.4,Infrastructure is is rather expensive and cumbersome.,,,
519,0.7910082340240479,2556.4,2576.1,"And so, I just want to be, I guess I'm wondering whether whether we have evaluated or done any Outreach to our housing developers around what the impact of this recital would be to",,,
520,0.9128386974334717,2576.5,2581.8, The the the sort of other shared goal and priority which is to quickly.,,,

522,0.8891142010688782,2586.2,2588.0," Chair, may I answer that?",,,
523,0.8891142010688782,2588.4,2590.8,Jerry Lewis?,,,
524,0.8891142010688782,2590.8,2591.9,Is it okay?,,,
525,0.8891142010688782,2591.9,2592.5,If I answer that?,,,
526,0.8891142010688782,2592.5,2593.6,Okay.,,,

532,0.8891142010688782,2600.0,2601.4,Thank you for the question.,,,
533,0.8891142010688782,2601.4,2616.0,"What we do know from, basically we're using the HUD requirement for any housing, that's financed with an fha-insured mortgage including including sometimes permanent Supportive Housing and and",,,
534,0.8272811770439148,2616.3,2616.6, Date.,,,
535,0.8272811770439148,2616.6,2621.9,When HUD has studied is that it's much more expensive to put it in later.,,,
536,0.8272811770439148,2621.9,2625.4,It's much cheaper to put it in up front.,,,
537,0.8272811770439148,2625.5,2629.4,And I think the intent here is really just to provide the internet service.,,,
538,0.8272811770439148,2629.4,2634.7,"It doesn't have to be the most expensive, you know, hard-wired option.",,,
539,0.8272811770439148,2634.7,2646.1,"So there may be a way to refine this language to say that, you know, we want them to give all due consideration to installing it installing internet access of some sort when they're putting it in.",,,
540,0.7855023145675659,2647.0,2658.4," To think about that upfront, rather than thinking about it later that they wish they had installed it because because the high need individuals that they're going to need access to this.",,,
541,0.7855023145675659,2658.4,2664.8,"A lot of in a lot of apartment projects, do have any computer center that they put in.",,,
542,0.7855023145675659,2664.8,2666.2,And so I don't,,,
543,0.8340474367141724,2667.7,2671.6, So I think that it's it's still value worth pursuing.,,,
544,0.8340474367141724,2672.1,2673.8,I can change the language though.,,,
545,0.8340474367141724,2674.5,2674.7,Yeah.,,,
546,0.8340474367141724,2674.7,2677.4,"I'm not, I'm actually not suggesting any language change at this point.",,,
547,0.8340474367141724,2677.4,2695.5,I was just trying to understand understand in in the context of the of the desired intent to to allow for permanent Supportive Housing to be built faster so that we can meet the scale of the of the need.,,,
548,0.8340474367141724,2695.6,2697.3,I just want to make sure that,,,
549,0.8759258985519409,2697.4,2710.3," Our housing providers aren't going to see this recital as as, as a, as an issue in that endeavor, and I haven't had any engagement yet with housing providers.",,,
550,0.8759258985519409,2710.3,2713.7,"So, I'm not sure what the answer to that it, but maybe folks from SMC.",,,
551,0.8759258985519409,2713.7,2727.4,"I might have a better sense of whether this is something that people are doing and they're just like, you know, it's normalized in the development world or if it's something that we need to make sure.",,,
552,0.7304352521896362,2727.4,2743.7," Make sure that we make sure that we are signaling that this is a, you know, this is really important for us to make sure that that Broadband is being fitted into new buildings as opposed to the retrofit because that is very expensive to do.",,,
553,0.7304352521896362,2744.6,2751.0,But I just I'm just sort of wanting to make sure that that this isn't something that's going to be seen as something that can't be overcomed.,,,
554,0.7304352521896362,2751.1,2753.0,But I'm supportive of the intent here.,,,
555,0.7304352521896362,2753.0,2755.9,I think it's important for us to make sure that we're building.,,,
556,0.8938802480697632,2757.5,2761.6, Supportive Housing and other structures around the city that are already fitted for broadband.,,,
557,0.9091130495071411,2765.3,2771.2," And we can have sec, I speak and also I'll offer to reach out to the Housing Development.",,,
558,0.9091130495071411,2771.2,2777.2,"Consortium is a good organization to reach out to, to get some initial input on something like this.",,,
559,0.9091130495071411,2777.6,2780.5,That's the benefit of having these amendments are today.,,,
560,0.9091130495071411,2780.5,2784.1,"And then we can, we can do some research and get back to First button.",,,
561,0.8908586502075195,2787.2,2795.5, And that's exactly what I was going to suggest to its information is probably better provided by the ngos and the other funders of these projects.,,,
562,0.8908586502075195,2795.9,2804.2,"And we would certainly work with council member Petersen, and your office councilmember Gonzalez to compile some information to help with this question.",,,

564,0.8908586502075195,2805.0,2805.7,Thank you so much.,,,
565,0.8908586502075195,2805.7,2816.6,"Just one more quick question here, if I made sure, yes, of course on the amendment number for does this in terms of permanent Supportive Housing is that",,,
566,0.9128385782241821,2816.9,2826.5," Find anywhere else in our codes and if so, is this definition consistent or inconsistent with those other definitions of permanent Supportive Housing?",,,
567,0.8732160925865173,2830.6,2833.9, But it's definition that we have here is specific to the land.,,,
568,0.8732160925865173,2833.9,2834.4,Use code.,,,
569,0.8732160925865173,2834.4,2837.0,This is a new definition for the land use code.,,,

571,0.8732160925865173,2849.5,2849.8,That they use.,,,
572,0.8732160925865173,2849.8,2852.3,I'll defer to Lori on what that is.,,,
573,0.8732160925865173,2852.8,2858.2,"Yeah, but the issue here in the and the request that the office has made around.",,,

575,0.8731103539466858,2860.6,2869.3," I mean, so with the awarding of the funding of the office of housing buildings, go straight into design and permitting.",,,

580,0.8886247277259827,2894.7,2897.6,It's the issue of timing and having it in the land.,,,

582,0.8886247277259827,2902.0,2913.3,So that's the request to counsel is because the timing is that there's all the pieces aren't in place by the time they're in for design and permitting and would need to have this legislation.,,,

1008,0.8210716843605042,5214.3,5216.8,As I said the program at the University.,,,
1009,0.9128385186195374,5216.9,5221.5," Tricked, I think we'll get what will be the first one that we bring online here.",,,
1010,0.9128385186195374,5221.9,5228.3,"Hopefully in q1, Q2 by Q3 it with an intuitive.",,,

1013,0.8430426716804504,5248.1,5253.6,And putting this program moving this program forward upon 15 million dollar program.,,,
1014,0.8430426716804504,5254.7,5259.0,We are now in the final final stretch here.,,,
1015,0.7314858436584473,5259.7,5283.9," Of completing contracts, two different contracts, silos, you know, one with hotels and the other with operators, but trying to take a backup, just how we got here, you know, FAS started with a list of 95 hotels, 80 hotels in the city, 15 outside of the city who were solicited for their interest, in being part of this program.",,,
1016,0.7314858436584473,5284.6,5288.1,And that set off a quite a bit of due diligence by our city team.,,,
1017,0.7314858436584473,5288.9,5289.4,And,,,
1018,0.8572898507118225,5289.5,5291.8, Quest for expressions of interests.,,,
1019,0.8572898507118225,5292.4,5293.6,We have now landed on.,,,
1020,0.8572898507118225,5295.9,5306.2,We did site visits at six hotels and selected from that to to move forward with one site within was not appropriate.,,,
1021,0.8572898507118225,5306.2,5318.1,"One site within one site with Drew, and then two other sites of those original six that we did a download with ended up signing contracts with can count.",,,
1022,0.8572898507118225,5318.7,5319.4,So,,,
1023,0.7793892621994019,5319.9,5323.2," Again, County in the city, continued to work together and coordinate.",,,
1024,0.7793892621994019,5323.7,5329.2,As we serve have overlapping service population and certainly funding partnership.,,,
1025,0.7793892621994019,5329.2,5329.5,"So,",,,
1026,0.8792784214019775,5332.9,5341.7," Other other things that we took in consideration on our search criteria included pricing, obviously willingness to work with the city believe or not.",,,
1027,0.8792784214019775,5341.7,5348.5,Just because somebody's hotels are sitting MP doesn't mean that they want to participate in this kind of program size of the hotel.,,,
1028,0.8792784214019775,5348.6,5362.3,"We are generally were looking at 50 to 150 rooms per site and then all the other things and availability, common spaces ventilation, obviously being a huge factor in our covid in",,,
1029,0.8981565833091736,5362.4,5364.8, Aren't so.,,,
1030,0.8981565833091736,5364.8,5372.0,"And then of course also, you know, electrical systems that can handle microwaves and rooms and other amenities.",,,
1031,0.8981565833091736,5372.0,5377.0,So we are continuing to work through that process.,,,
1032,0.8981565833091736,5377.0,5392.1,"Now, you know, I think but we are at the point where you know, the devil is in the details and but you know, both making sure that our hotel partners are fully aware of the",,,
1033,0.7504274845123291,5392.4,5406.7," G that we are are going to be using their properties for is an equally making sure that our operators are, that we have an agreement with them on the, on the budget and the way in which were going to approach that work.",,,
1034,0.7504274845123291,5406.8,5409.0,"And again, I just want to stress that.",,,
1035,0.7504274845123291,5409.0,5422.0,"As I said previously to counsel, you know, we feel very strongly, you know, based on looking at other jurisdictions that are totally not just here in the region, but across the West Post,",,,
1036,0.8675284385681152,5422.6,5428.9," That, you know, this program is not just about getting folks inside into a hotel shelter unit.",,,
1037,0.8675284385681152,5429.0,5432.4,"It also is about getting them into permanent housing, right?",,,
1038,0.8675284385681152,5432.4,5446.9,"And creating more screw put in our shelter system, so we can create a pathway for folks to get off the street and into a safer healthier environment and on the path into permanent housing.",,,
1039,0.8675284385681152,5446.9,5452.2,"So, as we wrap up here, we also will be, you know, bringing new pshh.",,,
1040,0.9128384590148926,5452.4,5462.1," It's online and working, you know, from the beginning to make sure that we have an exit plan for folks that come into our hotel shelter units.",,,
1041,0.8629563450813293,5464.7,5476.8," The other thing I just wanted to say is you know, we have spent we spent a lot of time thinking through our costs and budget for this for this program.",,,
1042,0.8629563450813293,5477.8,5486.0,"And you know, the reality is we have models right now that we're looking to for guidance there dese.",,,
1043,0.8629563450813293,5486.0,5487.8,"I think is a very good example, right?",,,
1044,0.8629563450813293,5487.8,5492.4,They are been telling folks for almost a year now they have been Servicing.,,,
1045,0.9027589559555054,5493.0,5500.1, Vulnerable population for nearly four decades that work in a partnership with King County and help to inform.,,,
1046,0.9027589559555054,5500.1,5506.6,"You know, what, we believe the appropriate budget would be for these units.",,,
1047,0.9027589559555054,5506.6,5509.7,So providing hand shelter services and hotel setting.,,,
1048,0.9027589559555054,5509.7,5512.5,"We landed at 19,000 dollars per unit.",,,
1049,0.9027589559555054,5512.5,5518.2,"That's for the service side, not for the sort of room rack rate.",,,
1050,0.9027589559555054,5518.2,5522.3,And so we're working with our providers to make sure that they can modify their,,,
1051,0.8354873657226562,5522.5,5533.8, Programs to meet that again so that we can get as many folks inside and on the path to breaking their experience with unsheltered homelessness.,,,
1052,0.8354873657226562,5534.3,5540.3,"So that's where we're at again, you know, two different, there's two really important.",,,
1053,0.8354873657226562,5540.3,5543.3,"Critical path things here, one is landing, our contracts.",,,
1054,0.8354873657226562,5543.3,5545.4,We do have license agreements with two hotels.,,,
1055,0.8354873657226562,5545.4,5552.4,"We had finished our contracts, those contracts are depending on our on our operators, coming to terms with them on a final program details.",,,
1056,0.7988202571868896,5552.9,5560.4, And budget details making sure that their programs can modify to me our budget that has been approved by the council.,,,
1057,0.7988202571868896,5560.4,5569.1,And I think is consistent with generally how other agencies in the region have been serving this vulnerable population.,,,
1058,0.7988202571868896,5569.7,5571.0,I could go on and on mr.,,,
1059,0.7988202571868896,5571.0,5574.1,"Chairman, but I take a pause here and see if folks are question.",,,
1060,0.8087528347969055,5575.1,5575.9," Yeah, thank you.",,,
1061,0.8087528347969055,5576.1,5576.7,Deputy Mayor.,,,
1062,0.8087528347969055,5576.7,5580.2,Six killer for that very detailed summary.,,,
1063,0.8087528347969055,5580.7,5590.5,I think we should transition to questions and that'll will probably surface some of the things that that we might not have been able to get to in the initial presentation.,,,
1064,0.8087528347969055,5590.5,5591.6,So I'm happy to Pivot.,,,
1065,0.8087528347969055,5591.6,5592.2,Now.,,,
1066,0.8087528347969055,5593.0,5598.2,I think that initially what I'd like to do just to keep us sort of organized with this.,,,
1067,0.8087528347969055,5599.4,5604.6,I think we should start maybe if people have questions about the tiny house Investments.,,,
1068,0.8225172758102417,5605.3,5613.0, First and maybe exhaust questions on the tiny houses first and then move on to questions related to the hoteling.,,,
1069,0.8225172758102417,5613.5,5619.1,"And then move on to any other questions regarding homelessness Investments, as sort of a third category.",,,
1070,0.8225172758102417,5619.1,5623.7,Just to make sure we can kind of sort of keep keep the discussion related.,,,
1071,0.8225172758102417,5624.0,5634.7,"Obviously, if other things come up, subsequently in the conversation, committee members should feel free to ask a question at any time, but I think that might make the most sense.",,,
1072,0.8004809021949768,5634.8,5637.6, To organize the discussion.,,,
1073,0.8004809021949768,5637.6,5641.6,So I think I'll initially kick it off.,,,
1074,0.8004809021949768,5643.4,5648.0,Mostly with just a an expression of appreciation.,,,
1075,0.8004809021949768,5648.0,5664.7,"For one of the initial comments you made in your presentation, which was was to focus on speed and you know, as I'm out in the community talking to people, that is a very commonly held sentiment, regardless of what end of the political Spectrum in the city.",,,
1076,0.7782833576202393,5664.9,5679.2," On you know, all of us are kind of united in this belief that the homelessness state of emergency is in a position where we're Swift response from the city is critical to to respond to the the scope of what we're facing.",,,
1077,0.7782833576202393,5679.2,5694.5,So in response to the initiative that my office has launched this week on Tiny House Villages and the it takes a village proposal to try to Galvanize Community interest in coming together and,,,
1078,0.8949169516563416,5695.0,5697.6, and building that common interest around the tiny houses.,,,
1079,0.8949169516563416,5697.8,5699.1,My office has been receiving.,,,
1080,0.8949169516563416,5699.1,5702.9,Lots of offers to help for a variety of different things.,,,
1081,0.8949169516563416,5702.9,5720.1,"Ranging from private contributions to volunteering labor material, lobbying, the state legislature for additional resources, legislators themselves contacting us about potentially getting capital budget money in the current session.",,,
1082,0.8949169516563416,5720.5,5724.7,"So this time I just want to say, I think that we",,,
1083,0.7585739493370056,5724.9,5752.0," Connect offline after this committee, but before the next committee meeting to maybe talk a little bit about how we might plug in a lot of these offers to help to an executable plan on the executive side to take advantage of that massive influx of energy and people that want to come forward and volunteer sites or contributions or other things.",,,
1084,0.7585739493370056,5752.0,5754.5,And so I that's the first thing I just want to.,,,
1085,0.9043118357658386,5754.8,5755.3, Flag.,,,
1086,0.9043118357658386,5755.3,5763.4,"We don't need to get into it in the committee, but it would be that's a sort of an action item for a February.",,,
1087,0.9043118357658386,5763.4,5764.5,I'd like to discuss.,,,
1088,0.9043118357658386,5764.5,5769.8,And I appreciate the the shared sense of urgency that the mayor's office has conveyed.,,,
1089,0.9043118357658386,5769.8,5777.4,I do want to ask before we move on from the tiny house Villages.,,,
1090,0.9043118357658386,5777.4,5784.0,It sounds like the site for council member Peterson's district is fairly.,,,
1091,0.9043118357658386,5784.0,5784.8,Well nailed down.,,,
1092,0.8281792998313904,5784.9,5788.2, On you alluded to a few additional sites.,,,
1093,0.8281792998313904,5788.2,5814.7,"Do we have a timeline and when the department might be ready to announce, but those sites would be and, and, and the Partnerships to, with all these sites in terms of The Operators that were that we're looking to bring in and if those rfps have been awarded or not, just a little bit more detail on that in terms of those next steps.",,,
1094,0.9128385186195374,5814.8,5816.7," Oops, on the tiny house, villages.",,,
1095,0.818356454372406,5817.9,5820.9, I think we'll be in a place probably next week in half.,,,
1096,0.818356454372406,5821.3,5822.0,If not sooner.,,,
1097,0.818356454372406,5822.0,5824.9,It's really meant to move to at least an ounce.,,,
1098,0.818356454372406,5824.9,5827.7,The second site and then potentially third.,,,
1099,0.818356454372406,5827.7,5835.0,One again was the recognition that we're trying to move with great speed here.,,,
1100,0.818356454372406,5835.7,5838.5,So I that's that's my goal.,,,
1101,0.818356454372406,5838.5,5842.9,At least the mayor is as impressed upon us.,,,
1102,0.818356454372406,5842.9,5846.2,A very strong desire to move as quickly as possible.,,,
1103,0.818356454372406,5847.0,5847.5,So,,,
1104,0.7930173873901367,5848.6,5860.0," It's probably the best answer I gave you can't remember, but we feel the fire underneath us and my hope is in the next week and a sword by the end of vitamin next week.",,,
1105,0.9128386974334717,5861.4,5861.7, Great.,,,

1120,0.8974847197532654,5902.7,5903.8,I just not clear to me.,,,
1121,0.8974847197532654,5904.0,5910.4,Has there been an RFQ issued and do we have respondents to that RFQ if there has been one?,,,

1129,0.8971160054206848,5934.2,5936.7,Where I think that there will probably be more questions.,,,
1130,0.8971160054206848,5938.3,5949.9,"I certainly have a couple, I do appreciate the front loading that the Human Services Department in the mayor's office has done this year to really focus on the hotel only intervention.",,,
1131,0.8960812091827393,5950.0,5962.6, We have a lot of compelling evidence from some other jurisdictions that have had robust hoteling programs that they can make a very big difference and and can be stood up quickly.,,,
1132,0.8960812091827393,5962.6,5978.6,I do want to start off just because it's sort of fresh in my mind from some reporting that has been out there generally regarding the hotels that was selected just to ask you as to the,,,
1133,0.7128965854644775,5980.0,5985.1," area and selecting suitable hotels, based on some of the allegations have been made in the Press.",,,
1134,0.7128965854644775,5986.3,6007.5,"I'm obviously not really in a position or with expertise to really know that the nature of of what does or doesn't make a hotel suitable, but it does seem that there's been reporting from some providers that are concerned about some of the hotels that have been selected for Lisa's.",,,
1135,0.7128965854644775,6008.2,6009.9,So I just wanted to start over the question.,,,
1136,0.8887974619865417,6010.1,6019.3," Learning what the process used to select the hotel's, the criteria that that process used.",,,
1137,0.8887974619865417,6019.3,6036.1,"And then whether those selections are set in stone or whether there might be flexibility to adopt a different hotelling model, based on the feedback that some providers are are making known publicly.",,,
1138,0.7668535709381104,6037.3,6049.2," Yeah, well, I think number one is I said, you know, we did initiate a formal process both for identifying original, you know, casting a wide net.",,,

1544,0.7783849835395813,8251.4,8261.5,Can you please comment on whether or not there is the ability to do that before removal sites are identified so that people can really triage what is needed before a site is put on that list.,,,
1545,0.9086076021194458,8262.2,8265.7," Sure councilmember, maybe a couple different things.",,,
1546,0.9086076021194458,8266.0,8275.5,One is I'm not aware of a removal list that's being developed.,,,
1547,0.9086076021194458,8276.8,8291.0,"There are there is ongoing conversation with various parts of the city about you know, obstruction upcoming construction, things like that sort of like a, you know, there's certainly conversations about sort of a watch list.",,,
1548,0.9086076021194458,8291.0,8291.6,I wouldn't say it's a,,,
1549,0.80704265832901,8291.8,8292.9, Out removal.,,,
1550,0.80704265832901,8293.3,8295.0,"The more about hey, you are areas.",,,
1551,0.80704265832901,8295.0,8305.2,And then through this new approach is making sure that we then are creating an ongoing dialogue with our Outreach.,,,
1552,0.80704265832901,8305.2,8313.9,"Contracted Outreach providers to short, problem-solve, how we deal with these areas, or these individual cases.",,,
1553,0.80704265832901,8313.9,8321.4,I think construction probably being one of the easiest ones for us to to work with.,,,
1554,0.7650637030601501,8322.4,8325.9," But that's why we're you know, we're got the weekly meetings.",,,
1555,0.7650637030601501,8326.2,8327.1,We are standing up.,,,
1556,0.7650637030601501,8327.1,8331.4,"We have stood up on within the city Side, you know, sort of that interdepartmental team.",,,
1557,0.7650637030601501,8331.4,8341.7,"I know that's not very credit but to try to make sure we're doing coordination and then also trying to figure out and learn how we have more integration, but it's not is not removal focused.",,,
1558,0.7650637030601501,8342.2,8344.6,It is really where he's hot spots.,,,
1559,0.7650637030601501,8344.6,8348.7,Are we coordinating with with Outreach?,,,
1560,0.7650637030601501,8348.7,8351.6,I think I didn't talk about it today and I won't take time talk about it right now.,,,
1561,0.8265548348426819,8351.8,8353.5, But our Clean Cities program.,,,
1562,0.8265548348426819,8353.5,8363.3,"Making sure there's not any confusion that that is, you know, a code word for removal is not but also making sure their contract and Outreach knows where we're going to be.",,,
1563,0.8265548348426819,8363.3,8369.0,"And if there are areas that we can partner with them, you know, maybe it's removal of abandoned tensor.",,,
1564,0.8265548348426819,8369.0,8371.1,"What are the, what are the other things that we need to be doing?",,,
1565,0.8265548348426819,8371.1,8376.3,So we're we're trying to build a lot of muscle memory right now.,,,
1566,0.8265548348426819,8376.7,8381.3,I feel good about where we're headed.,,,
1567,0.8265548348426819,8381.3,8381.5,But I,,,
1568,0.8862972259521484,8381.7,8384.3," I will admit to you that we're not, we're not there yet.",,,
1569,0.8862972259521484,8385.9,8390.6,"And but I do feel, you know, we're trying to keep your information.",,,
1570,0.8862972259521484,8390.9,8402.0,"I think, as I said, maybe try several view offline, you know, we're also in the process of rebuilding trust and I think that's really important and insert.",,,
1571,0.8862972259521484,8402.0,8411.6,"So certainly of folks feel like we've come up with a removal list, you know, we will need will need to address that certainly because that's not the",,,
1572,0.9021657109260559,8412.8,8414.4, That's not the goal.,,,
1573,0.9021657109260559,8414.8,8418.1,So what we'll deal with that.,,,
1574,0.9021657109260559,8418.5,8419.3,"Okay, thank you.",,,
1575,0.9021657109260559,8419.3,8432.2,"Yeah, I think it's the it's the resolution dates and having a better sense of how we're coordinating with Community Partners when those areas get put on the list for the resolution dates and I know councilmember hurdle has her hand up.",,,
1576,0.9021657109260559,8432.2,8435.3,"Just also want to say you know, this is the same week.",,,
1577,0.9021657109260559,8435.3,8442.7,"We just passed Hazard pay so as we're thinking about, who is being put In Harm's Way to help these folks, we've offered for dollar.",,,
1578,0.8274370431900024,8442.8,8444.7, More an hour to grocery workers.,,,
1579,0.8274370431900024,8444.7,8447.0,And so I really hope that.,,,
1580,0.8274370431900024,8447.0,8455.3,The next time we have a conversation that issue is resolved and those Federal FEMA dollars are made available because saying here's the box that Council gave us.,,,
1581,0.8274370431900024,8455.3,8457.0,We all want to be flexible on that.,,,
1582,0.8274370431900024,8457.0,8462.8,We are recognizing especially that the folks who are providing Outreach to our homeless or community and offering those Services.,,,
1583,0.8274370431900024,8463.1,8469.7,They also should be able to earn a living wage and they're put in Hazzard weight hazards way every day.,,,
1584,0.8274370431900024,8470.0,8472.7,So if folks are asking for a little bit more and I don't think it's three times.,,,

1586,0.7899124622344971,8476.9,8478.7,"I think it's worth it, especially during this time.",,,
