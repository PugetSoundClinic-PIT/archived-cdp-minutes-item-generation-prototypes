164,0.97,819.084,830.296,I'm chair of tree pact and I want to say that we as an organization are disappointed in the effort so far.,25,,
165,0.97,830.296,842.675,No draft language has been available for public review and we question how you can do a determination of Non-Cig Thif cans without allowing the public to first review a draft and look at the impacts.,25,,
166,0.97,842.675,852.918,We to the best of your knowledge draft be available for about two weeks as usual.,25,,
167,0.97,852.918,859.258,We feel very little outreach was done by Sdci and ose this reaching people.,25,,
168,0.97,859.258,870.703,They held listening sessions with 29 people and tried to draw conclusions on some major issues like whether or not we should be permit to remove significant trees.,25,,
169,0.97,870.703,894.026,Meanwhile the--tree pact along with the Northwest progressive Institute has--a poll that we did that showed that--we did with 617 people with the 4.3% margin of error.,25,,
170,0.97,894.026,900.532,"Hit a 2-1 margin, 57% supporting, 28 opposing.",25,,
171,0.97,900.532,902.134,15% not sure.,25,,
172,0.97,902.134,910.409,"Also increasing protection for significant exceptional trees polled 78%, 13% in opposition.",25,,
173,0.97,910.409,916.348,And adding replacement requirements for significant exceptional trees holds 76 forest 13%.,25,,
174,0.97,916.348,922.488,We think the poll shows the public support out there for this effort and you need to listen to it.,25,,
175,0.97,922.488,934.5,"We also want to note that several years ago, two years ago we also did a Change.Org outreach.",25,,
176,0.97,934.5,940.105,So please listen to the public and create a strong ordinance.,25,,

190,0.97,963.996,982.114,I'm calling to support the energy code amendment but I'm really calling today to speak to you about the need to move ahead more aggressively on addressing climate change in existing buildings which contribute far more greenhouse gases than new buildings.,29,,
191,0.97,982.114,988.153,I urge you to start working behind the scenes on how to address the existing buildings.,29,,
192,0.97,988.153,993.859,There is lots of excellent resources and support in our city and people willing to help.,29,,
193,0.97,993.859,999.064,There are other cities who are stepping forward now and now it is time for Seattle.,29,,
194,0.97,999.064,1004.903,You know as an engineer this crisis reminds me of a crack in the bridge.,29,,

196,0.97,1007.272,1025.023,"It is small now and seems insignificant perhaps but if we don't address it quickly, will propagate--it will propagate faster.",29,,
197,0.97,1025.023,1031.764,This is how the climate is now.,29,,
198,0.97,1031.764,1041.874,I--I know and I appreciate how hard you are working on having and are working on all the changes in our city and there are many.,29,,
199,0.97,1041.874,1049.214,I ask you to take the climate crisis much more to heart and start working harder on this issue.,29,,
200,0.97,1049.214,1052.751,Thank you so much for your time.,29,,
201,0.97,1052.751,1055.02,"Thank you, Holly.",30,,

206,0.97,1065.898,1071.303,"However, I may have made a mistake here.",31,,

212,0.97,1083.115,1085.217,I may have misnamed the caller.,35,,

214,0.97,1090.923,1096.728,"Oh, this might have been.",36,,

219,0.97,1099.598,1100.766,Good morning.,38,,

221,0.97,1110.409,1111.41,"Oh, lost you there.",38,,
222,0.97,1111.41,1111.677,Hello?,39,,
223,0.97,1111.677,1112.578,We are back.,40,,
224,0.97,1112.578,1116.315,"Yes, I would like to comment--your machine is doing weird stuff.",41,,
225,0.97,1116.315,1126.492,I would like to comment on both number six and number--agenda number four.,41,,
226,0.97,1126.492,1126.859,Hang tight.,42,,
227,0.97,1126.859,1134.266,Number six--go--we will give you two minutes now and then call you back for the public hearing.,42,,
228,0.97,1134.266,1136.068,You have two minutes.,42,,
229,0.97,1136.068,1136.401,Thank you.,43,,
230,0.97,1136.401,1137.503,My name is Richard.,43,,
231,0.97,1137.503,1150.949,I I would like to comment on the Scci report t quarterly report which completely ignored recommendation by the urban forest commissions draft tree protection ordinance.,43,,
232,0.97,1150.949,1156.889,Which by the way had 900 positive comments and support.,43,,
233,0.97,1156.889,1174.506,The city will not require permits to remove--[Indiscernible] this in my mind is the latest scandal of Sdci.,43,,
234,0.97,1174.506,1204.236,They claim they are listening sessions of--[Indiscernible] Sdci interviewed only 29 people in total yet in contrast to the 20201 polling by Npi of 617 likely voters overwhelmingly favored it.,43,,
235,0.97,1204.236,1204.636,18% agreed.,43,,
236,0.97,1204.636,1212.744,Only 11% disagreed that Seattle tree ordinance should be strengthened.,43,,
237,0.97,1212.744,1215.013,57% liked the permit system.,43,,
238,0.97,1215.013,1216.315,Only 28% were against permits.,43,,
239,0.97,1216.315,1222.354,The majority said thumbs up 2-1 over thumbs down in favor of a per Nit system.,43,,
240,0.97,1222.354,1224.923,How did they conclude so differently?,43,,
241,0.97,1224.923,1234.166,They gave only vacant August--suggestions of how to increase it.,43,,
242,0.97,1234.166,1239.838,You can't evaluate environmental impact if you don't know what the exact policies are going to be followed.,43,,
243,0.97,1239.838,1260.892,"If you really want to keep the tree canopy in Seattle as a big mitigation for 100 degree summer days and record rainfall winters, then put your foot down and tell Sdci to require permits and better tree protection and how is that creating green factors?",43,,
244,0.97,1261.026,1261.994,[Indiscernible],43,,
245,0.97,1262.127,1265.163,"Thank you, Richard.",44,,
246,0.97,1265.163,1268.7,We will have you back up in a moment.,44,,
247,0.97,1268.7,1278.377,Double confirming we have no further public comment?,44,,
248,0.97,1278.377,1280.512,Yes.,45,,
249,0.97,1280.512,1281.613,"Thank you, Mr. G.",46,,
250,0.97,1281.613,1284.883,We will move on to the next danger item.,46,,
251,0.97,1284.883,1291.857,Our first danger item is Council bill 120206.,46,,
252,0.97,1291.857,1298.463,Will you please read this item into the record.,46,,
253,0.97,1298.463,1321.053,"Danger item 1, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning amend mending the Seattle new police--[Indiscernible] it is located to those eligible for the affirmative marketing and community policy.",47,,
254,0.97,1321.053,1321.62,Wonderful.,48,,
255,0.97,1321.62,1332.064,As I shared at our briefing on Friday this legislation--this is the second time it is coming before our committee before we pass it.,48,,
256,0.97,1332.064,1336.268,Has taken us about three years to get us to this point today.,48,,
257,0.97,1336.268,1345.344,Again want to recognize Council member Juarez for her consistent leadership for her residents in D-5.,48,,
258,0.97,1345.344,1349.314,I'm partial to my own district but really like D-5 as well.,48,,
259,0.97,1349.314,1356.388,"Council member Juarez, great job lead Ing for your district.",48,,
260,0.97,1356.388,1368.533,As many of today's danger items I will ask we us fend rules to--suspend the rules.,48,,
261,0.97,1368.533,1371.403,Recognizing each of these bills have been in committee twice.,48,,
262,0.97,1371.403,1373.905,So just want to highlight that from my colleagues.,48,,
263,0.97,1373.905,1382.013,We will ask to suspend the rules on a number of bills today.,48,,
264,0.97,1382.013,1394.359,Before we open the public hearing Mr. Freeman could you provide us brief refresher on this legislation?,48,,
265,0.97,1394.359,1394.593,Sure.,49,,
266,0.97,1394.593,1408.373,Perhaps I will share my screen here ask concentrate on a few of the slides here that the committee looked at last Friday.,49,,
267,0.97,1408.373,1424.556,So Council bill 120206 as Council member Strauss mentioned--those two are both located adjacent to each other.,49,,
268,0.97,1424.556,1445.844,"In terms of the regulations themselves, the current bill flows from a settlement agreement with the owner of Developy and make some changes to the bill that the Council was considering back in the summer, council bill 120079.",49,,
269,0.97,1445.844,1457.322,"The proposed over lay district would limit residential uses to mobile homes, mobile home parks and low-income housing.",49,,
270,0.97,1457.322,1473.405,Allow some commercial uses but limit the size of those uses so they are less likely to be developed on a mobile home park site.,49,,
271,0.97,1473.405,1478.71,Remove some set back in city limits and immediate area requirements in the prior proposal.,49,,
272,0.97,1478.71,1487.953,The current regulations that apply to mobile home parks that are on building code would regulate mobile home park redevelopment.,49,,
273,0.97,1487.953,1504.636,"Affirm current C-155 zoning which is the zone designation put in place for the Mha and establish the city's intent to periodically Revisit the District and finally provide for expiration the over lay district at approximately--January 1, 2051.",49,,
274,0.97,1504.636,1510.542,So that in a nutshell is what Council bill 120026 would do.,49,,
275,0.97,1510.542,1524.823,Also as the committee will recall on Monday the full council voted to extend the current mobile home park--the moratorium on redevelopment and mobile home parks.,49,,
276,0.97,1524.823,1552.651,So assuming that this bill passes full Council on Monday--it would become effective January and the Mobile home park moratorium--the moratorium would lift at that time.,49,,
277,0.97,1552.651,1553.418,So that is a refresher.,49,,
278,0.97,1553.418,1558.456,I'm happy to answer any questions you might have now or at the end of the commentary.,49,,
279,0.97,1558.456,1562.227,"Thank you, Mr. Freeman.",50,,
280,0.97,1562.227,1563.995,I have a few questions.,50,,
281,0.97,1563.995,1568.667,"Colleagues, if you have questions, please come--please come off camera--or on camera.",50,,
282,0.97,1568.667,1577.475,First question Mr. Freeman I've heard some questions from the community members about why any Non-Residential uses would be allowed.,50,,
283,0.97,1577.475,1580.779,Can you explain why some commercial uses were included?,50,,
284,0.97,1580.779,1581.146,Sure.,51,,
285,0.97,1581.146,1597.162,"A lot of those--the structure of the bill, what is allowed in the over lay, what is not allowed, the limitations on current uses have to do with the land use law.",51,,
286,0.97,1597.162,1606.371,Essentially what this bill tries to do is to make mobile home parks a continuing highest and best use of the land.,51,,
287,0.97,1606.371,1626.191,I does that by limiting the Non-Residential uses that could occur on the current zoning to make them less likely to occur so that--so that a mobile home Park is--has a preferable use while it is in place.,51,,
288,0.97,1626.191,1632.697,The current zoning is a framing description.,51,,
289,0.97,1632.697,1656.988,"Now to this specific question, because the current zoning is C-155 and has been commercial prior to the Mha zone, we have to allow some commercial uses so that--an owner who has some reasonable investment backed expectations that they could use the site for commercial uses could preserve that and still try meet that expectation.",51,,
290,0.97,1656.988,1680.945,"However, it is a lot less likely that a developer that a current owner or more developer would develop the sites with uses because the intensity of the uses and the range of uses is less than what would otherwise be allowed in the commercial 155 zone.",51,,
291,0.97,1680.945,1693.058,You can imagine approximately four story building lot line the lot line on both sides.,51,,
292,0.97,1693.058,1697.629,Under the over lay the allowed floor area ratio is less.,51,,
293,0.97,1697.629,1700.432,It is just two for commercial uses.,51,,
294,0.97,1700.432,1705.637,"There is a maximum size limit for commercial uses of 5,000 square feet.",51,,
295,0.97,1705.637,1711.509,"That means somebody seeking to develop a commercial use on the site would be limited to a building about 5,000 square feet.",51,,
296,0.97,1711.509,1719.851,"They could not--if they wanted to put more multiple 5,000 square foot buildings on the site they would have to phase that over multiple years.",51,,
297,0.97,1719.851,1722.52,There would be a significant transaction cost.,51,,
298,0.97,1722.52,1729.294,So just to be clear the over lay doesn't preclude somebody Redeveloping the sites with commercial uses.,51,,
299,0.97,1729.294,1736.101,The only way the city could provide a guarantee that would not happen is if the city acquired the sites.,51,,
300,0.97,1736.101,1742.207,It makes it much less likely that they will be dropped.,51,,
301,0.97,1742.207,1743.241,Thank you.,52,,
302,0.97,1743.241,1752.984,I know there are some good protections and program--parameters in bill.,52,,
303,0.97,1752.984,1758.79,It is the most prominent option to move forward with.,52,,
304,0.97,1758.79,1773.771,If we did not allow for the commercial uses then affordable housing that built a--a tower of affordable housing could not have a coffee shop on the first floor?,52,,
305,0.97,1773.771,1786.084,"No--lets say that a side or portion of one of the mobile Homesite social security Redeveloped, the primary use would have to be the principle use--the principle use would have to be a residential use.",53,,
306,0.97,1786.084,1798.229,That residential use could be in a mix used building that has some modest commercial components to it like a coffee shop or some other institutional use or something like that.,53,,
307,0.97,1798.229,1804.202,But it would not have for example--it would be less likely to have on the ground floor a Wal-Mart.,53,,
308,0.97,1804.202,1808.506,Or other sort of big box retailer.,53,,
309,0.97,1808.506,1808.873,Wonderful.,54,,
310,0.97,1808.873,1810.975,That is very helpful.,54,,
311,0.97,1810.975,1827.725,Can you share what other safe guards would be in place to prevent a developer from tearing down homes and using the property for Non-Residential use use?,54,,
312,0.97,1827.725,1838.636,The principle uses allowed would be mobile home parks and mobile homes and--and affordable housing developed by a non-profit.,55,,
313,0.97,1838.636,1845.043,So that is the primary thing.,55,,
314,0.97,1845.043,1849.881,It tips the scales.,55,,
315,0.97,1849.881,1859.424,It is the size that commercial use could be developed to.,55,,
316,0.97,1859.424,1862.894,There is a maximum size limit per establishment.,55,,
317,0.97,1862.894,1863.828,That is another safe guard.,55,,
318,0.97,1863.828,1868.633,A third safe guard has to do with phasing and development.,55,,
319,0.97,1868.633,1895.059,"So somebody could not come in, Subdivide the parcel and have separate 5,000 square foot buildings on multi--[Indiscernible].",55,,
320,0.97,1896.094,1896.661,Very helpful.,56,,
321,0.97,1896.661,1897.662,Very helpful.,56,,
322,0.97,1897.662,1898.83,Different question here.,56,,
323,0.97,1898.83,1904.102,There has been some confusion about median income levels in the legislation.,56,,
324,0.97,1904.102,1910.742,Can you clarify how AMI works and confirm the AMI levels on the legislation.,56,,
325,0.97,1910.742,1911.409,"They are maximums, correct?",56,,
326,0.97,1911.409,1911.676,Yeah.,57,,
327,0.97,1911.676,1914.245,They are--they are maximums.,57,,
328,0.97,1914.245,1924.989,"The reason the city uses median income as a posed to average income or something like that is for incomes, particularly average is always much higher.",57,,
329,0.97,1924.989,1932.497,So somebody can't make less than $0 a year but somebody can make millions of dollars a year.,57,,
330,0.97,1932.497,1945.009,The reason that the city and HUD and other affordable housing developers use median income is to--is to adjust for the fact that average is always SKEWED higher.,57,,
331,0.97,1945.009,1951.215,The maximum affordable level here is about 60% of AMI.,57,,
332,0.97,1951.215,1955.32,I don't have the city's scaled income charts in front of me right now.,57,,
333,0.97,1955.32,1965.563,"My recollection is that the median income in the city of Seattle is about $100,000 a year for a two person household these days.",57,,
334,0.97,1965.563,1969.1,"So--qualifying household could earn no more than $60,000 a year.",57,,
335,0.97,1969.1,1976.307,There are a couple of specific protections in here for the current mobile home park residents.,57,,
336,0.97,1976.307,1990.788,"So for those residents who--exercise a first offer and choose to come back to an affordable housing development, they--I would pay no more than 40% of AMI or 30% of their current income.",57,,
337,0.97,1990.788,2003.267,If somebody is earning less than 40% of the income they would--they would not have to pay up to 40% of AMI.,57,,
338,0.97,2003.267,2008.339,That being said that is a provision that is unique to the current mobile home.,57,,
339,0.97,2008.339,2020.651,That wouldn't be true of folks who might live in an affordable housing development developed on the side of the future who we are not residents of the Mobile home.,57,,
340,0.97,2020.651,2021.185,Thank you.,58,,
341,0.97,2021.185,2021.652,Very helpful.,58,,
342,0.97,2021.652,2029.427,"And last question here, can you elaborate or--on the height limits?",58,,
343,0.97,2029.427,2033.831,Sure.,59,,
344,0.97,2033.831,2039.904,The maximum height for commercial development under the current zoning is 55-Feet.,59,,
345,0.97,2039.904,2045.276,Somebody could build an approximately five or six story building on the site.,59,,
346,0.97,2045.276,2050.782,So with the over lay there are more restrictive development standards.,59,,
347,0.97,2050.782,2054.819,So the under line zoning does not apply.,59,,
348,0.97,2054.819,2062.66,For that there has to be some physical development standards.,59,,
349,0.97,2062.66,2076.04,As I said earlier the intent is to make it more likely that mobile home parks are--they are not 30-Feet in height.,59,,
350,0.97,2076.04,2086.083,We don't know what future innovations there might be and--development of structures that meet the definition of manufactured home and the land use code.,59,,
351,0.97,2086.083,2105.403,"So we want to apply some kind of limitation there so in the future if there is something unanticipated we will at least have some way of regulating it, hence the 30-Foot height limit.",59,,
352,0.97,2105.403,2112.777,It is also intended to make it less likely that somebody might choose to develop a commercial structure on a mobile home park site.,59,,
353,0.97,2112.777,2117.815,So if somebody did choose to do that there would be a height limit.,59,,
354,0.97,2117.815,2118.316,It would be 40-Feet.,59,,
355,0.97,2118.316,2124.121,So about 15 -Feet less than they would be allowed to develop.,59,,
356,0.97,2124.121,2124.722,Very helpful.,60,,
357,0.97,2124.722,2125.356,Thank you.,60,,
358,0.97,2125.356,2126.324,Any other questions?,60,,
359,0.97,2126.324,2130.661,I know we have had this bill back before us so many times.,60,,
360,0.97,2130.661,2142.874,I have to clear all few things based on some of the correspondents and information I received from our district director.,61,,
361,0.97,2142.874,2148.88,He has been meeting with the residents for quite a while.,61,,
362,0.97,2148.88,2153.184,So we know the LING Orange and how a lot of this works.,61,,
363,0.97,2153.184,2156.087,I will ask you to slow down a little bit.,61,,
364,0.97,2156.087,2156.721,There are three things.,61,,
365,0.97,2156.721,2161.792,We have to start with the premise that this is private property.,61,,
366,0.97,2161.792,2162.86,It is not government property.,61,,
367,0.97,2162.86,2165.963,So the government just can't tell a private property owner what to do.,61,,
368,0.97,2165.963,2170.701,There are--we have zoning laws and all those other uses.,61,,
369,0.97,2170.701,2180.244,And what evolved from all of this is an agreement between property owners so we can ensure that the people living there that are elderly or low-income can stay there.,61,,
370,0.97,2180.244,2182.68,"If they build it up, they can come back.",61,,
371,0.97,2182.68,2193.157,Some of the confusion with some of our elderly relatives are that they don't quite understand AMI.,61,,
372,0.97,2193.157,2202.066,If you can just explain AMI kind of its origins and why the state and Federal Government use it as yardstick to determine housing.,61,,
373,0.97,2202.066,2206.804,It is not the perfect yardstick but it is the one we have.,61,,
374,0.97,2206.804,2207.939,Just like the definition for poverty.,61,,
375,0.97,2207.939,2211.976,It is pretty bad but it is the one we start with.,61,,
376,0.97,2211.976,2217.782,I think people that are watching from the residential homes that is where they are stuck.,61,,
377,0.97,2217.782,2221.986,The second part is--why it is not a spot zone?,61,,
378,0.97,2221.986,2224.355,Why they are allowed other uses.,61,,
379,0.97,2224.355,2228.626,Because in that--if there weren't that would be a spot zone and that would be illegal.,61,,
380,0.97,2228.626,2235.499,If we could clear that up and maybe in a little more terms for our relatives listening.,61,,
381,0.97,2235.499,2236.3,Thank you.,61,,
382,0.97,2236.3,2246.444,I will start with maybe a definition of what median is and I think some people hear median and assume it means average.,62,,
383,0.97,2246.444,2247.678,The median is the midpoint.,62,,
384,0.97,2247.678,2254.418,The range of incomes in the city of Seattle at the very bottom end might be $0.,62,,
385,0.97,2254.418,2260.591,At the very high end there might be many millions of dollars.,62,,
386,0.97,2260.591,2266.597,Median is the midpoint in that range of incomes in the city.,62,,
387,0.97,2266.597,2286.817,"The reason that HUD doesn't use average, the state of Washington doesn't use average is because average--[Indiscernible] there are people making much more than half a million dollars a year.",62,,
388,0.97,2286.817,2300.131,If they were to use something like average the qualifying income would Skew higher than midpoint.,62,,
389,0.97,2300.131,2303.734,That is the reason the city uses median.,62,,
390,0.97,2303.734,2306.304,They are based on household size.,62,,
391,0.97,2306.304,2309.44,Median income is scaled by household size.,62,,
392,0.97,2309.44,2324.088,Imagine you can imagine say--a one person household is only one income earner in that household--a median income in that household would be different than a two person household or a three person household or a four person household.,62,,
393,0.97,2324.088,2338.669,There is a Scaling of Affordabilities that is based on the household size and all that information comes from surveys conducted by the Federal Government and the state.,62,,
394,0.97,2338.669,2341.605,That I think hopefully answers the question.,62,,
395,0.97,2341.605,2347.645,I am happy to--I don't think I can just on the fly pull up the office of housing link.,62,,
396,0.97,2347.645,2351.349,I always have to search for it for many minutes.,62,,
397,0.97,2351.349,2357.688,I am just trying to make sure that--our relatives who live there understand.,63,,
398,0.97,2357.688,2363.994,That has been a point where Dean has tried really hard.,63,,
399,0.97,2363.994,2381.178,Is it fair to say that this is--I don't want to go--be too dramatic if it is historic but I don't know where we have had these type of agreements with the manufactured mobile home park in the city of Seattle.,63,,
400,0.97,2381.178,2387.017,The last one they actually sold--they sold and built housing there.,63,,
401,0.97,2387.017,2387.685,This one we saved.,63,,
402,0.97,2387.685,2388.219,Yeah.,64,,
403,0.97,2388.219,2394.391,"Just to be clear about who the agreement is with, it is not with both owners.",64,,
404,0.97,2394.391,2398.462,It was with the Bella bee owner.,64,,
405,0.97,2398.462,2413.477,It informs--it informs this current Iteration of the bill--but the settlement agreement is largely about the state policy act appeal.,64,,
406,0.97,2413.477,2422.72,"So while that--while the settlement agreement informs this version of the bill, this is something that is up for Council consideration and could be modified.",64,,
407,0.97,2422.72,2437.802,But the--in terms of the history of mobile home parks in the city--I am not aware of any other settlement agreements that resulted in--in a change to regulation.,64,,
408,0.97,2437.802,2443.507,There is a rich history of the city struggling with how to preserve mobile home parks.,64,,
409,0.97,2443.507,2452.65,There was the recent redevelopment of the Mobile home Park you are talking about that is off Lake City way.,64,,
410,0.97,2452.65,2461.625,In the 90S and 80s there were Moratory--like the city has now on redevelopment of mobile home parks.,64,,
411,0.97,2461.625,2486.584,Some of those--some of that--elevation of the issue from--redevelopment from the threat of redevelopment of mobile home parks led to changes to title 22 which is the primary regulatory--portion of the Seattle municipal code when it comes to mobile home parks.,64,,
412,0.97,2486.584,2493.324,There are extended notice periods and requirement of the plan.,64,,
413,0.97,2493.324,2500.865,Something largely--mirrors state law would have some city additions to it as well.,64,,
414,0.97,2500.865,2509.54,.,65,,
415,0.97,2509.54,2511.942,Thank you.,66,,
416,0.97,2511.942,2513.277,That is very helpful.,66,,
417,0.97,2513.277,2521.385,"Just confirm Council member Juarez, no further questions?",66,,
418,0.97,2521.385,2521.685,Seeing none.,66,,
419,0.97,2521.685,2521.886,Great.,66,,
420,0.97,2521.886,2523.254,"Colleagues, any other questions?",66,,
421,0.97,2523.254,2524.955,Not seeing any at this time.,66,,
422,0.97,2524.955,2529.56,I want to now bring us up to--opening the public hearing.,66,,
423,0.97,2529.56,2534.498,And again Mr. Freeman thank you for those Clarifications.,66,,
424,0.97,2534.498,2534.932,The AMI especially.,66,,
425,0.97,2534.932,2539.803,The average versus the median is very helpful.,66,,
426,0.97,2539.803,2548.646,Before we begin--before we open the hearing I would ask everyone please be patient as we continue to learn to operate this new system and Realtime and navigate through growing pains.,66,,
427,0.97,2548.646,2560.457,We are looking for ways to fine tune this process and adding new features that allow for additional means of public participation in our Council meetings.,66,,
428,0.97,2560.457,2564.662,I will be calling on one Speaker at time.,66,,

512,0.97,2919.85,2920.117,"So, yes.",90,,
513,0.97,2920.117,2939.569,Thank you to the committee for working so hard on this and I know that--there is so many details that--I'm going to move over so I'm out of range of my computer cause I'm getting feedback.,90,,
514,0.97,2939.569,2951.214,So--I appreciate the--explanations of things in the bill and--there we go.,90,,
515,0.97,2951.214,2973.136,"And--and I do know it has been a long time, a long haul, but I also--I want to put in a last minute plug for making sure things are consistent and if--a regular negotiation needs to occur then it will have to occur.",90,,
516,0.97,2973.136,2983.68,I also do think that this is better than what we have now which is no protections.,90,,
517,0.97,2983.68,2998.695,"So, um, that is since I do support this passing if you find that you really can't figure out a way to make any of the changes that we have suggested and we do need to go ahead.",90,,
518,0.97,2998.695,3000.831,So that is final comment I wanted to make.,90,,

599,0.97,3284.28,3292.689,If the land was sold the manufactured home would have to be moved but the home was old enough it would not have survived a move.,128,,
600,0.97,3292.689,3299.129,So this is an interesting gray area in private property.,128,,

632,0.97,3400.23,3414.31,Appreciated the opportunity to have the public hearing on this legislation last Friday to get this--rolling and wrapped up by the end of this year.,144,,
633,0.97,3414.31,3422.218,"In the interim my office did coordinate with Yolanda and your office, Mr. chair, to set a date certain amendment we will consider.",144,,
634,0.97,3422.218,3444.941,With that I can hold the rest of my comments until consideration of the bill itself resting on our discussion from the hearing on Friday and I will have some questions for Yolanda regarding the amendment and then some closing remarks before we do a vote on the legislation.,144,,

638,0.97,3455.218,3460.657,We have a packed agenda this time.,145,,
639,0.97,3460.657,3463.993,I will ask for a brief refresher.,145,,
640,0.97,3463.993,3470.2,Anything you would like to share before we vote?,145,,
641,0.97,3470.2,3474.103,Yolanda Council central staff.,146,,
642,0.97,3474.103,3477.774,We have colleagues from the Seattle Department of construction here.,146,,
643,0.97,3477.774,3498.194,Just wanted to do a quick Recap of the legislation so that everyone remembers what we are discussing here that Council bill 120239 would amend the energy code.,146,,
644,0.97,3498.194,3512.242,The city has a standard practice of an and an amended version that requires new multi-family residential buildings taller than three stories and all new commercial buildings to conform to higher standard than those required by the state.,146,,
645,0.97,3512.242,3523.353,Regulations also fly alterations.,146,,
646,0.97,3523.353,3532.929,Water heating restrictions were permitted to multi-family and hotel uses based on their more predictable water usage.,146,,
647,0.97,3532.929,3552.582,The committee considered amending the 2018 energy code in February to extend this restriction to all commercial buildings during the deliberations but instead requested that the Seattle Epartment of construction inspection conduct additional work on the proposal due to a variety of complicating factors that made it--for the committee to take action.,146,,
648,0.97,3552.582,3555.985,This legislation is the result of that requested work.,146,,
649,0.97,3555.985,3571.768,It would require that all new commercial buildings use electric heat pump water heaters with some exceptions that were recommended by the construction codes advisory board which is independent advisory board for the city regarding amendments to the city's construction codes.,146,,
650,0.97,3571.768,3578.408,Most notably one exception was made for that it does not apply to upgrades of existing commercial buildings.,146,,
651,0.97,3578.408,3584.314,And it also included some technical and clarifying amendments.,146,,
652,0.97,3584.314,3593.556,With that Summery I will be happy to entertain questions or have colleagues from the Department --,146,,
653,0.97,3593.556,3593.99,Great.,147,,
654,0.97,3593.99,3597.493,I see you have come off mute.,147,,
655,0.97,3597.493,3599.729,Anything you would like to share?,147,,

657,0.97,3599.996,3600.296,Great.,149,,
658,0.97,3600.296,3602.999,Any questions for Yolanda?,149,,
659,0.97,3602.999,3605.935,We had a really robust conversation last week.,149,,
660,0.97,3605.935,3606.269,Seeing none.,149,,
661,0.97,3606.269,3624.988,As you recall on Friday there were discussions of setting a date certain as Council member Lewis mentioned for implementation of these new requirements.,149,,
662,0.97,3624.988,3639.202,After consulting with Sdci an implementation date of April 1ST was agreed upon.,149,,
663,0.97,3639.202,3646.542,Council member Lewis and I have an amendment that would add April 1ST as an implementation date.,149,,
664,0.97,3646.542,3654.55,So we are going to move the base legislation and move the amendment.,149,,
665,0.97,3654.55,3661.524,There is no further discussion I will move the legislation and then amendment.,149,,
666,0.97,3661.524,3662.191,Is there a second?,149,,
667,0.97,3662.191,3663.326,Second.,150,,
668,0.97,3663.326,3664.861,Thank you.,151,,
669,0.97,3664.861,3670.6,I move to amend that.,151,,
670,0.97,3670.6,3674.937,Now will move to amend Council bill on the danger.,151,,
671,0.97,3674.937,3675.838,Is there a second?,151,,
672,0.97,3675.838,3676.806,Second.,152,,
673,0.97,3676.806,3681.911,Thank you.,153,,
674,0.97,3681.911,3682.545,It has been moved and Seconded.,153,,
675,0.97,3682.545,3690.72,"Council member Lewis, would you like to speak to this?",153,,
676,0.97,3690.72,3690.953,Yes.,154,,
677,0.97,3690.953,3691.921,Thank you chair Strauss.,154,,
678,0.97,3691.921,3715.478,"I think just to--for our due diligence in this discussion of the amendment and just to talk briefly about the significance of setting a date certain, maybe give Yolanda a chance to do an over view of the practical impact of the amendment and then I could ask a few follow up questions based on Yolanda's brief over view of the amendment.",154,,
679,0.97,3715.478,3715.711,Yes.,155,,
680,0.97,3715.711,3746.742,"So the amendment--so without the amendment the legislation would go into effect somewhere in mid, late January depending on the Mayor's signature process--assuming the Council passes legislation on December 13th and then it gets sent over to the Mayor's office for a signature or no signature and assuming the Mayor allows it to go into effect it would--I estimated somewhere around January 22nd would.",155,,
681,0.97,3746.742,3748.744,So that would be quite soon.,155,,
682,0.97,3748.744,3768.131,The amendment then pushes this effective date out to April 1ST allowing the Seattle Department of constructions and inspections to conduct average as described by the chair and let everyone know this is happening versus kind of--especially around the timing with the holidays and everything.,155,,
683,0.97,3768.131,3773.836,There is--there is--there should be ample time to allow for that outreach.,155,,
684,0.97,3773.836,3785.281,That is--the effect of this amendment.,155,,
685,0.97,3785.281,3785.615,Thank you.,156,,
686,0.97,3785.615,3786.482,Any other --,156,,
687,0.97,3786.482,3799.462,"Chair, that over view--is it Su fish Dwroent explain the underlying merits of having a date certain set relative to what the current effective date would be given when we are passing the bill?",157,,
688,0.97,3799.462,3811.04,I don't have any other questions about the dates certain but--once we amended and we are looking at final passage I might ask a few clarifying things of Yolanda.,157,,
689,0.97,3811.04,3816.546,I think this satisfies my question on the date certain amendment.,157,,
690,0.97,3816.546,3816.813,Great.,158,,
691,0.97,3816.813,3823.152,So if there are no further questions it has been amended.,158,,

706,0.97,3847.143,3858.454,Council member Lewis or colleagues any other questions or comments before we vote on the legislation as amended?,170,,
707,0.97,3858.454,3875.705,Yes I do have--I have one can question from reviewing the legislation and anticipation of this hearing that I did want to ask Yolanda just cause I don't know if we covered this in our hearing on Friday.,171,,
708,0.97,3875.705,3891.42,The practical impact of the significant clause in the legislation and Yolanda if maybe you could explain little bit about what the significant Fz alterations clause is.,171,,
709,0.97,3891.42,3899.795,It is an area I don't think we addressed on Friday.,171,,
710,0.97,3899.795,3907.069,I--might want to turn to my colleague Dwayne to pitch in on this one.,172,,
711,0.97,3907.069,3924.52,I think--we just--we did discuss that this legislation does not impact if there is a replacement of equipment and an existing building.,172,,
712,0.97,3924.52,3925.388,This applies to the commercial buildings.,172,,
713,0.97,3925.388,3925.922,I think I will let Dwayne.,172,,
714,0.97,3925.922,3926.155,Dwayne.,172,,

717,0.97,3936.198,3949.945,This is referring Dwayne to the underlying bill talking about the significant alterations clause.,174,,
718,0.97,3949.945,3955.084,Just an over view and--of the implications and the impact of that.,174,,
719,0.97,3955.084,3958.387,It is something--some folks have reached out about.,174,,
720,0.97,3958.387,3967.863,You are talking about the underlying code or something in this--this current amendment that we are making here?,175,,
721,0.97,3967.863,3976.439,I'm still not completely sure what it is that--you are asking.,175,,
722,0.97,3976.439,3976.706,Right.,176,,
723,0.97,3976.706,3989.018,It is the practical scope of work that would Drinkinger the need for compliance with this new code under the significant alterations clause.,176,,
724,0.97,3989.018,3993.055,Okay.,177,,
725,0.97,3993.055,3993.622,I'm getting it.,177,,
726,0.97,3993.622,3998.327,Substantial alteration social security a point in the Seattle code where we consider almost a new building.,177,,
727,0.97,3998.327,4015.411,This is often a complete gut and Remodel of an existing building and--and--it is defined typically as--substantially extending the physical or economic life of the building.,177,,
728,0.97,4015.411,4019.882,It is a very big deal.,177,,
729,0.97,4019.882,4031.093,In those--situations we do require that--that the--the water heater be brought up to code.,177,,
730,0.97,4031.093,4046.142,What we have exempted though elsewhere in it is your more Pip Cal situation where--the water heater has gone out or they just want to replace it and its a gas water heater.,177,,
731,0.97,4046.142,4052.381,We are still allowing that for the time being.,177,,
732,0.97,4052.381,4052.715,Thank you.,178,,
733,0.97,4052.715,4064.627,I think that gets to the crux of some of the concern I've heard from people about how this might--might influence significant alteration versus new build.,178,,
734,0.97,4064.627,4071.2,I think that that is going to go a long way some of the concerns we have heard.,178,,
735,0.97,4071.2,4073.469,I appreciate you clarifying that.,178,,
736,0.97,4073.469,4073.803,Certainly.,179,,
737,0.97,4073.803,4074.27,"Thank you, Dwayne.",180,,
738,0.97,4074.27,4082.311,Thank you for Joel also for joining us last week.,180,,
739,0.97,4082.311,4083.913,Understanding this is a compromise.,180,,
740,0.97,4083.913,4088.484,"Colleagues, any other questions before we move forward?",180,,
741,0.97,4088.484,4091.253,There is no further discussion on the legislation as amended.,180,,
742,0.97,4091.253,4096.725,I would love to move recommended passage of Council bill 120239.,180,,

755,0.97,4117.746,4120.816,"Five in favor, none opposed.",191,,
756,0.97,4120.816,4123.552,Thank you.,192,,
757,0.97,4123.552,4125.654,The motion carries.,192,,
758,0.97,4125.654,4128.557,Council bill 120239 as amended passes.,192,,
759,0.97,4128.557,4128.924,Thank you all.,192,,
760,0.97,4128.924,4136.532,This legislation will be before the full Council on Monday December 13th.,192,,
761,0.97,4136.532,4148.544,Will you please read the abbreviated title into the record?,192,,
762,0.97,4148.544,4166.529,Amending the Seattle municipal code to authorize the director of the Seattle Department of construction and inspections to Administrate Ily waive development standards for minor exams of sewage Treatmet plants.,193,,
763,0.97,4166.529,4167.53,Thank you.,194,,
764,0.97,4167.53,4169.765,I took a sip of my coffee.,194,,
765,0.97,4169.765,4180.009,We heard from the leadership of King County waste treatment division about the importance of allowing this work to move forward.,194,,
766,0.97,4180.009,4196.225,Can you provide us brief refresher on this legislation that will allow for a 55-Foot building in a neighborhood residential zone that is a park on a grated slope that no one can see the building from the park?,194,,
767,0.97,4196.225,4196.759,All right.,195,,
768,0.97,4196.759,4228.023,So just by way of a reminder on Friday--[Indiscernible] this bill would modify otherwise applicable land use procedures to create a limited exception for an expansion of the treatment plant.,195,,
769,0.97,4228.023,4230.993,It would categorize the expansion as minor.,195,,
770,0.97,4230.993,4252.147,When it is below current size limits for minor expansions--[Indiscernible] the qualification is the development has to be required by our Department of order for corrective action.,195,,
771,0.97,4252.147,4265.361,It would authorize the Seattle Department of construction the director of Sdci to waive physical development standards here.,195,,
772,0.97,4265.361,4275.537,It would require a construction management plan to mitigate any potential impacts.,195,,
773,0.97,4275.537,4279.608,It is unclear--whether there will be any construction impacts from this.,195,,
774,0.97,4279.608,4296.125,Its possible and perhaps likely that King County will be able to accommodate most of the construction and staging et cetera on site.,195,,
775,0.97,4296.125,4313.175,It would make some procedural changes to allow King County to apply for a building permit prior to receiving any waivers from the city and finally would declare a state of environmental policy active emergency to exempt both this Council bill 120215.,195,,
776,0.97,4313.175,4330.225,I should have started with just a reminder about what the problem is that this legislation seeks to solve.,195,,
777,0.97,4330.225,4338.667,"Just by a way of a reminder the purpose is to facilitate construction of a building to house Non-Line, Uninterruptible power supply.",195,,
778,0.97,4338.667,4352.748,So a large building with batteries inside of it to allow construction of that building sooner than might otherwise be able to occur.,195,,
779,0.97,4352.748,4362.725,So hopefully that is a good enough refresher.,195,,
780,0.97,4362.725,4371.266,There is the power point presentation--[Indiscernible],195,,
781,0.97,4371.4,4375.738,"Thank you, Mr. Freeman.",196,,
782,0.97,4375.738,4377.406,"Council member Pedersen, please.",196,,
783,0.97,4377.406,4379.007,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",197,,
784,0.97,4379.007,4383.912,This is a real good example of different city departments working together.,197,,
785,0.97,4383.912,4397.426,The city working with King County to get there done.,197,,
786,0.97,4397.426,4409.438,"They have been an ongoing issue and that--Seattle city light has been working hard with King County waste water division, Seattle public utilities is involved.",197,,
787,0.97,4409.438,4416.645,We all want to see a reduction in unnecessary flows that haven't been treated.,197,,
788,0.97,4416.645,4430.526,There were several ways to do this and this I want to compliment central staff for coming up with a solution here and being very thorough about it.,197,,
789,0.97,4430.526,4436.031,I want to thank chair Strauss for shepherding it through his committee.,197,,
790,0.97,4436.031,4440.536,It really helped have that special meeting last week so we could hear it twice and get it done before the end of the year.,197,,
791,0.97,4440.536,4449.077,Then it is really up to King County to take it from here and to get it done.,197,,
792,0.97,4449.077,4461.19,Just gratitude all around to serve this basic problem of treating our waste water before it gets into our water ways.,197,,
793,0.97,4461.19,4461.49,Thank you.,197,,
794,0.97,4461.49,4464.359,Thank you Council member Pedersen.,198,,
795,0.97,4464.359,4482.511,Just highlighting the fact that this building that we are providing will create an Uninterruptible power source.,198,,
796,0.97,4482.511,4484.746,"Colleagues, any other questions?",198,,
797,0.97,4484.746,4498.727,"And--seeing none for--Linda--since I don't have anyone present, do I need read the instructions for the public hearing or can I just open and close it?",198,,
798,0.97,4498.727,4505.934,Council member Strauss you should probably read the Instruks in case somebody was not there earlier on in the meeting.,199,,
799,0.97,4505.934,4506.168,Okay.,200,,
800,0.97,4506.168,4506.502,Thank you.,201,,

956,0.97,5211.039,5222.55,The changing of the name is a deliberate action to facilitate the reduction of restriction in development.,254,,
957,0.97,5222.55,5223.151,How will it be saved?,254,,

992,0.97,5447.642,5454.715,"That this is just a name change, while the ultimate goals of a name change might be different for different people.",269,,
993,0.97,5454.715,5487.048,"At this time, I think just technically the actual substance will happen next year, so I just want to ensure people who are concerned about massive blanket changes to zoning, that I will be asking questions about displacement, about preserving trees, about are we doing this for low income housing, or are we doing it for real estate development.",269,,
994,0.97,5487.048,5489.784,To make sure we achieve our goals.,269,,
995,0.97,5489.784,5490.651,I'll be voting yes today.,269,,
996,0.97,5490.651,5499.327,"As my colleagues said, it is technically just a name change at this point.",269,,
997,0.97,5499.327,5499.627,Thank you.,269,,
998,0.97,5499.627,5504.332,Thank you Councilmember Petersen.,270,,
999,0.97,5504.332,5508.636,"Councilmember Lewis, or Juarez, any further comments?",270,,
1000,0.97,5508.636,5514.809,"Seeing none at this time, Councilmember Mosqueda, you will have the last word.",270,,
1001,0.97,5514.809,5547.942,"Just to follow up on what Councilmember Lewis said, I and the rest of the Council are ready to have comments with the community, I too will be making sure to Prioritize how we couple policy changes that are driven by community with protecting and investing in more trees, and protecting against displacement, and promoting new policies to prevent displacement, as we also think about how to address comprehensive plan updates.",271,,
1002,0.97,5547.942,5552.647,So look forward to those discussions in 2022 with all of you.,271,,
1003,0.97,5552.647,5567.561,"I want to thank Councilmember Strauss for sponsoring this legislation that we have in front of us, amending the comprehensive plan to rename single fame zones, a misnomer into a more inclusive, and accurate neighborhood residential term.",271,,
1004,0.97,5567.561,5584.345,"I think this legislation allows us to set the ground for good, reflecting conversations in the upcoming year that reflect the true character of Seattle's neighborhoods, as we embark to know more about what changes community may desire.",271,,
1005,0.97,5584.345,5597.992,"Major updates which Rewill work Andresing next year to create policies for really getting at the root of Exclusionary zoning, that is still making a mark and our land use and zoning policies in the city.",271,,
1006,0.97,5597.992,5600.494,I'm excited about the legislation in front of us.,271,,
1007,0.97,5600.494,5612.974,"As I am excited, I also want to look up what Councilmember Pedersen has noted, and what central staff has noted.",271,,
1008,0.97,5612.974,5616.01,This will not update the zoning itself.,271,,
1009,0.97,5616.01,5627.188,"We're looking forward a more encouraging zoning policy, as we work through the comprehensive plan, major updates throughout 2022 to consider any policy changes in the year 2023.",271,,
1010,0.97,5627.188,5641.068,"So the legislation in front of us really contains a technical change, recognizing the term, single family, used in Seattle's planning language is a misnomer, as I said.",271,,
1011,0.97,5641.068,5651.679,"It has a legacy, and Exclusionary zoning practices, and we as a city are conclusive to a more active policy name.",271,,
1012,0.97,5651.679,5670.197,"We have proposed an adopted in the comprehensive plan, the more inclusive accurate name, neighborhood residential, recognizing that neighborhoods are already home to diverse housing that was built before the increasingly restrictive zoning policies went into place.",271,,
1013,0.97,5670.197,5678.939,"It includes housing smack businesses, parks, trees, schools, and services, as well as diverse housing types that include single family, but not only single family within those designations.",271,,
1014,0.97,5678.939,5689.316,So this legislation in front of us helps to reflect the reality that single family as a name doesn't reflect the current makeup of those neighborhoods.,271,,
1015,0.97,5689.316,5716.277,"And again I just have to mention the four story Brownstone that I used to live in on Queen Anne that had been basically Affectively zoned into a single family area, but all around me, were single family homes as well as Duplexes and Triplexes and small apartment buildings like mine, and we want to actually have a name that's truly reflective.",271,,
1016,0.97,5716.277,5723.117,"So it is more accurately reflecting a neighborhood like I lived in, and so many across the city.",271,,
1017,0.97,5723.117,5729.156,"Further from a purely technical perspective, single family has been a misnomer since 1994.",271,,
1018,0.97,5729.156,5741.035,"Since 1994 when they added legislation the excessive dwelling unit legislation went into effect, which allowed more than one household to live on a single parcel, we have been operating with a misnomer on the books since 1994.",271,,
1019,0.97,5741.035,5772.199,"So this is a great opportunity to make that technical change, and again, I want to thank all the Council, and Councilmember Pedersen as well, and Councilmember Strauss on your leadership on this issue, along with my staff, Aaron house, who has been the driving force in our office for community engagement, and some of the technical change with you Lish, so I thank you Lish for all of your work on this.",271,,
1020,0.97,5772.199,5778.572,"And representative Mackry, and representative chalk, in thinking through how we create create more inclusive language for our zoning conversations.",271,,
1021,0.97,5778.572,5812.94,"I want to thank them along with the Seattle South side Chamber of Commerce Sierra Club of Seattle, the AIA chapter, and the share of cities along with 350 Seattle, because when we create more opportunities for an inclusive Seattle further people get pushed out of the city, further people are coming in, and fewer trees and farmlands and wetlands are encroached upon, so looking forward to those conversations throughout next year, throughout 2022, and then to develop policy with you all in 2023.",271,,
1022,0.97,5812.94,5817.344,Thank you very much.,271,,
1023,0.97,5817.344,5834.228,Thank you Councilmember Moss Moss Cado.,272,,

1026,0.97,5837.631,5854.982,"As by context, I know it's going on throughout the countries, and it's important that we're able to retain our neighborhood character, and retain the way that our neighborhoods look, feel, and shape, while we are able to bring more people into our communities.",272,,
1027,0.97,5854.982,5862.623,"With that, I would like to remove to recommend passage of 120214.",272,,
1028,0.97,5862.623,5863.057,Is there a second?,272,,

1077,0.97,6170.097,6170.764,No.,291,,
1078,0.97,6170.764,6205.899,"Just that, you know, anybody who knows the central district and this section of it is well aware that it's undergoing a breathtaking changes in a very rapid way, and I have no objection to density and making properties able to accommodate more and more people as we seek to avoid homelessness in our city.",291,,
1079,0.97,6205.899,6211.071,But this particular piece of property has history that is worth preserving.,291,,

1081,0.97,6220.781,6229.556,And I think is not inconsistent with naming it as a protected property.,291,,
1082,0.97,6229.556,6235.195,But it would be nice to preserve a little bit of the historic nature.,291,,

1089,0.97,6276.303,6298.425,"I just think that the visual comparison of Amy's neighbors to her home is very illustrative of the conversation we were just having about the Quads, Duplexes, Triplexes, how you can maintain the character of your neighborhood, and add the people in your neighborhood that you need to.",292,,
1090,0.97,6298.425,6307.234,"And I understand that Jimi Hendrix may have practiced here, is that correct, Amy?",292,,

1092,0.97,6323.65,6333.994,"After the church decided to sell, and remove the nuns they couldn't sell because nobody could get a loan in the central district.",293,,
1093,0.97,6333.994,6335.195,So it was vacant.,293,,
1094,0.97,6335.195,6337.597,People roller Skated in it.,293,,
1095,0.97,6337.597,6341.134,People had band practices in it.,293,,
1096,0.97,6341.134,6343.036,It was quite a lively abandoned spot for a while.,293,,
1097,0.97,6343.036,6345.205,That's part of the history of the building.,293,,
1098,0.97,6345.205,6345.472,Wow.,294,,
1099,0.97,6345.472,6348.909,Can you you expand on that a little bit more?,294,,
1100,0.97,6348.909,6353.68,Can you share how your property was negatively impacted by our history of red lining?,294,,
1101,0.97,6353.68,6371.898,"Well, I mean, as we know the central district was the target of efforts to restrict access to home ownership by black and Brown people.",295,,
1102,0.97,6371.898,6386.113,The banks restricted loans to people of color and in this particular area it was very difficult then to get a loan.,295,,
1103,0.97,6386.113,6389.082,Thank you for sharing that with us.,296,,
1104,0.97,6389.082,6395.856,And thank you for your and your mother's efforts in preservation of this property.,296,,

1108,0.97,6405.932,6413.34,"I'm all for density, and there's good ways of doing density, and this is one of them.",296,,
1109,0.97,6413.34,6413.974,Councilmember.,297,,
1110,0.97,6413.974,6414.574,"Yes, Erin, please.",298,,
1111,0.97,6414.574,6423.116,"Councilmember Strauss, just to follow up on the property, I think that you're Referencing is directly to the North of this home.",299,,
1112,0.97,6423.116,6432.058,"That was, Amy, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that had been the home of jazz legend Vernon Pops Beauford.",299,,
1113,0.97,6432.058,6446.173,"And it's the Vernon family who has shared the history and recollections of Jimi Hendrix playing there, and kids in the neighborhood roller skating in the convent.",299,,
1114,0.97,6446.173,6447.007,And there it is.,300,,
1115,0.97,6447.007,6466.293,"This was the house that was torn down, and let's see if I can find a picture of what is currently there, I may not be able to quickly in my slide deck we put together many, many slides for this nomination.",300,,
1116,0.97,6466.293,6470.297,Here's currently the box that's next door.,300,,
1117,0.97,6470.297,6472.599,"So again, I'm all for density.",301,,
1118,0.97,6472.599,6479.706,"I just want to note that by tearing down that one house, we put in four homes, which is good.",301,,
1119,0.97,6479.706,6480.307,Density is good.,301,,
1120,0.97,6480.307,6491.952,"It's sad that we lost a historic home like that, and just noting that we can preserve the character of the neighborhood while creating density by doing things.",301,,
1121,0.97,6491.952,6499.659,And we displaced a family that historically was in the central district for many generations.,302,,
1122,0.97,6499.659,6500.093,A black family.,302,,
1123,0.97,6500.093,6520.146,And the four boxes next door were so expensive they can now only be occupied by Tech people who make a lot of money.,302,,
1124,0.97,6520.146,6524.417,"With that Councilmember paid Pedersen, I see you have a comment.",303,,
1125,0.97,6524.417,6542.602,"I just want today thank Amy for mentioning that is one of the key challenges we face as we want to increase density, and make sure we're not displacing, and make sure there's Affordability in those new units so that, so it's not just for hiring people.",304,,
1126,0.97,6542.602,6549.209,So thank you for just providing that anecdote.,304,,
1127,0.97,6549.209,6556.049,"Since I brought up where I used to live, let me bring up where I currently live.",305,,
1128,0.97,6556.049,6558.184,I live in one of those boxes.,305,,
1129,0.97,6558.184,6563.29,I live in one of four townhouses on a piece of property that used to have just one single family home.,305,,
1130,0.97,6563.29,6567.193,I think it has to be a both and.,305,,
1131,0.97,6567.193,6582.943,"I don't want this conversation to trickle into a discussion where we think that all homes that resemble townhouses are a one size fits all, as Councilmember Pedersen said.",305,,
1132,0.97,6582.943,6596.256,"I want to remind folks that the work that we've done through the housing committee has been to Prioritize building affordable housing, coupled with a community preference policy, and affirmative marketing policy.",305,,
1133,0.97,6596.256,6634.461,"When you couple development with affordable, excuse me, when you couple development period with community preference and affirmative marketing, you can make sure that folks who have the highest risk of displacement, especially those that have the highest risk of displacement, the African American community, specifically that have the legacy of being the recipient of discriminatory policies, we can address not only displacement, but help to right those historic wrongs, and just don't want to have those buildings or that type of building be representative of the displacement that we all are committed to addressing.",305,,
1134,0.97,6634.461,6675.902,"And look forward to addressing this legislation, but just felt it was important to Juxtapose with where I used to live with where I currently live and the reason I was able to buy it, buying a place is out of reach in most of Seattle, being able to purchase a place that was finally made available because of the density for creating four housing units where one used to stand, I think is a good example of where we can create density, and Inclusivety, and we have to couple that with Anti- displacement strategies, which we talked a lot about with the racial equity tool kit, from earlier this summer that Mr.",305,,
1135,0.97,6675.902,6687.213,Chair you had in your Committee so I look forward to working with you all on this approach.,305,,

1212,0.97,7077.003,7080.106,These all together framed and guide our work.,342,,
1213,0.97,7080.106,7088.981,Goals and policies together with feedback and input provide us guidance.,342,,
1214,0.97,7088.981,7089.415,"Next slide, please.",342,,
1215,0.97,7089.415,7101.06,So Sdci and Osd and its partners have been working to improve tree protections an explore strategies to increase tree protections as outlined in resolution 31902.,342,,
1216,0.97,7101.06,7111.471,Council requested to explore the following strategies to expand the exceptional tree definition and retain exceptional tree definitions.,342,,
1217,0.97,7111.471,7114.14,Create a significant tree removal permit.,342,,
1218,0.97,7114.14,7116.576,Require replacement for significant tree removal.,342,,
1219,0.97,7116.576,7122.181,Simplify the tree planting and replacement requirements.,342,,
1220,0.97,7122.181,7124.65,Maintain existing tree removal limits.,342,,
1221,0.97,7124.65,7135.728,"Explore a payment in lieu option for payment, and continue to track tree Removals and replacement.",342,,
1222,0.97,7135.728,7151.077,"Through October, Sdci and Osc worked to obtain feedback on strategies listed in resolution 31902 from bi Poc and other commuters.",342,,
1223,0.97,7151.077,7159.418,That feedback helped us identify and understand community and Stakeholder interest and parities that will help shape and form our recommendations.,342,,
1224,0.97,7159.418,7164.657,"To do this, we used a two Prong approach to the community engagement.",342,,
1225,0.97,7164.657,7185.578,The first approach was to include an interdepartmental partnership with the Department of neighborhoods community liaisons program to conduct a Properliy appropriate engagement to provide low income and low canopy neighborhoods.,342,,
1226,0.97,7185.578,7188.614,The other focused on input through Online listening sessions.,342,,
1227,0.97,7188.614,7200.092,"In order to allow time for more inclusive engagement, SDI and Osd chose to conduct two forms.",342,,
1228,0.97,7200.092,7204.03,This work took place between July and October.,342,,
1229,0.97,7204.03,7207.9,A combined summary report of those results.,342,,
1230,0.97,7207.9,7211.771,That report was posted on the Sdci Website in November.,342,,
1231,0.97,7211.771,7220.947,"This shows the summary of the feedback of the topics that were based to the groups, which were based on the strategies in the resolution.",342,,
1232,0.97,7220.947,7225.184,On the topic of exceptional tree protections there was broad support for expanding more trees.,342,,
1233,0.97,7225.184,7233.426,There was also a caution by many of the groups that they did not want to see a one size fits all approach.,342,,
1234,0.97,7233.426,7235.861,They wanted input incorporated reflecting that comment.,342,,
1235,0.97,7235.861,7248.007,There is split support for creating a category for significant trees at the time in both the listening sessions and also in the community group work.,342,,
1236,0.97,7248.007,7257.183,"Many people felt that there was maybe not a need for a category, but they also were split on protecting exceptional trees.",342,,
1237,0.97,7257.183,7269.095,"They wanted this definition to be expanded further, and then some expressed concern that it might create a burden on homeowners if this new category of larger trees is regulated.",342,,
1238,0.97,7269.095,7274.166,While many supported increasing tree protections beyond the exceptional tree category.,342,,
1239,0.97,7274.166,7282.408,So the resolution calls for the exploring of the development of a permit system for trees outside development.,342,,
1240,0.97,7282.408,7291.817,"So this was also discussed with the groups, and there was not support for creating a new tree removal permit in this discussion.",342,,
1241,0.97,7291.817,7301.694,There was a variety of concerns and so this one received the least amount of support of the topics discussed.,342,,
1242,0.97,7301.694,7316.175,"Among the groups, the bi Poc groups and Online listening sessions there was wide support across all the groups for the development of a payment in lieu option, and also the tree service provider Legislaion.",342,,
1243,0.97,7316.175,7324.95,Lastly there is a strong support expressed for updating and increasing enforcement.,342,,
1244,0.97,7324.95,7325.484,"Next slide, please.",342,,
1245,0.97,7325.484,7330.056,"Sorry, Chanda, I had some questions on slide five.",343,,
1246,0.97,7330.056,7338.197,Specifically about the split support and lack of support for significant tree definitions and the simple permit.,343,,
1247,0.97,7338.197,7341.333,"Can you share what, do we know what motivated these concerns?",343,,
1248,0.97,7341.333,7357.917,"I would note that we see strong support for updating enforcement, and protecting exceptional trees and based on my experience, it's been challenging to enforce the current tree protections without a requirement for a permit to remove a tree.",343,,
1249,0.97,7357.917,7361.387,I can imagine that sentiment around permits would change.,343,,
1250,0.97,7361.387,7364.457,"So I guess with that, I'll just bring it back.",343,,
1251,0.97,7364.457,7366.592,Do we know what motivated these concerns?,343,,
1252,0.97,7366.592,7380.873,Some of the feedback that we received from bi Poc communities was that they did not feel that they wanted more government regulations.,344,,
1253,0.97,7380.873,7384.61,So that was a general sentiment.,344,,
1254,0.97,7384.61,7392.518,"Then other groups were split on, they wanted increased protections for exceptional trees.",344,,
1255,0.97,7392.518,7399.291,And there was a split on where that threshold would lie.,344,,
1256,0.97,7399.291,7399.558,Okay.,345,,
1257,0.97,7399.558,7414.473,"But as far as, and if we need to follow up later, I guess this is just information that I'm trying to understand more in a detailed fashion.",345,,
1258,0.97,7414.473,7415.741,Just the motivations behind this.,345,,
1259,0.97,7415.741,7421.68,"This is good for now, let's keep moving forward, and I'm circle back after committee.",345,,
1260,0.97,7421.68,7436.695,So Sdci and Osc and its partners have been working to express strategies to further protect trees as outlined and feedback has been helping to form and shape our efforts over the past few months.,346,,
1261,0.97,7436.695,7441.333,So we've learned a few things and we're striving for increased tree protections.,346,,
1262,0.97,7441.333,7448.34,"In the next few slides in the presentation today, I will cover these five key strategies that together we're exploring to get there.",346,,
1263,0.97,7448.34,7456.715,"So this first one here is a tree service provider registration, and service provider and homeowner Self- reporting.",346,,
1264,0.97,7456.715,7460.453,The second one is the Expangs of the definition of exceptional tree.,346,,
1265,0.97,7460.453,7469.795,"And the third is the defining of a significant tree he of as a new category, and also adding replacement requirements for significant trees.",346,,
1266,0.97,7469.795,7473.699,Fourth is to allow for a payment and new option.,346,,
1267,0.97,7473.699,7484.51,And Lastly we would like to simplify processes and update enforcement.,346,,
1268,0.97,7484.51,7489.248,So this first strategy being explored is the tree service provider registration program.,346,,
1269,0.97,7489.248,7495.821,This could increase the quality of work and adds for accountability.,346,,
1270,0.97,7495.821,7500.693,Sdci is looking for business practices and I.T.,346,,
1271,0.97,7500.693,7505.431,Support for a new program which would include for the new program.,346,,
1272,0.97,7505.431,7522.515,"The first would have tree risk qualifications, there also could be an acknowledgement requirement, which would be an Online Submental to let neighbors know about tree Removeles, before trees are removed.",346,,
1273,0.97,7522.515,7525.017,A tool could be linked to an existing tree tracking system.,346,,
1274,0.97,7525.017,7536.529,This would be an opportunity to help close the information data gap that we've been hearing about when trees are removed outside of development.,346,,
1275,0.97,7536.529,7547.773,So this GIS tool could track tree removal not only by homeowners but also registered tree service providers.,346,,
1276,0.97,7547.773,7563.222,"The second strategy being Exexplored is to expand the definition of exceptional trees by lowering the threshold, of what is now 30 inches in diameter at standard height down to 24 inches in standard height.",346,,
1277,0.97,7563.222,7571.43,Adding protections for tree groves and heritage trees while maintaining definitions for small Exesional trees.,346,,
1278,0.97,7571.43,7585.644,"To break this down further, part of the strategy could be not only to lower that threshold down to include exceptional trees, but would also include all the exceptional trees in our 2008 expectational tree rule.",346,,
1279,0.97,7585.644,7590.549,Some of which do not fall in that 30 to 24-inch range.,346,,
1280,0.97,7590.549,7594.687,"Some of those trees are smaller, like 6 and 9 inches in diameter.",346,,
1281,0.97,7594.687,7598.857,Some of these smaller exceptional trees have several ecological functions and benefits that we value.,346,,
1282,0.97,7598.857,7605.164,And we want to protect as we look at expanding the protections for exceptional trees.,346,,
1283,0.97,7605.164,7613.639,"Some of these smaller diameter trees could be included in that expanded definition, even though they are not larger tree species.",346,,
1284,0.97,7613.639,7619.044,So tree species that would be removed from the list are Invasive tree species.,346,,
1285,0.97,7619.044,7620.646,Probably just a very small number.,346,,
1286,0.97,7620.646,7645.971,"The goal here is to ensure that we're not encouraging planting of tree species that are listed on King County, the most published list of Invasive tree species in order to make sure that we are not including tree species that are detrimental to the health of our tree canopy.",346,,
1287,0.97,7645.971,7656.582,The third strategy being explored is to define significant trees as any tree that has a diameter or standard height of 6 inches or greater that is not defined as an exceptional tree.,346,,
1288,0.97,7656.582,7663.856,The current tree code does not provide a definition or any replacement requirements for significant trees.,346,,
1289,0.97,7663.856,7676.568,"The strategy could add a new code requirement that plan reviewers would consider ways to protect this new category of trees, clarifying that trees in Nondevelopment areas, those are yards and set backs, are protected.",346,,
1290,0.97,7676.568,7696.288,"So this means that plan reviewers would consult Sdci Arborists to determine which trees have the greatest ecological functions and which ones are true the trees with the highest priority for protecting and preserving, and those are the trees that we could regulate to protect.",346,,
1291,0.97,7696.288,7703.896,We're also exploring replacement requirements for trees 12 inches and greater.,346,,
1292,0.97,7703.896,7718.043,"So the fourth strategy being explored is to allow for an option of payment in lieu, when payment is expected.",346,,
1293,0.97,7718.043,7720.746,Clearly indicated there is a lot of support for this policy.,346,,
1294,0.97,7720.746,7735.327,"We know in certain times like the low rise zones, there's just not enough physical space on the site to plant new trees that could grow to the maturity, even in the adjacent planting strips.",346,,
1295,0.97,7735.327,7749.775,"This strategy could also provide funds to existing tree planting programs, like those that are already established in at least two other city departments, including the Seattle Department of transportation and the parks Department to plant these new trees.",346,,
1296,0.97,7749.775,7760.552,"It 0 also include a targeted focus to plant new trees in mapped areas with low canopy cover, many of which are bi Poc communities.",346,,
1297,0.97,7760.552,7771.997,"Such as higher rates of asthma, due to lower air quality.",346,,
1298,0.97,7771.997,7784.943,"So this last strategy is all encompassing, we're exploring ways to look at penalties for illegal tree cutting and removal.",346,,
1299,0.97,7784.943,7796.321,It would support data driven decisions in the future to monitor tree canopy and protect trees and in doing so improve customer service.,346,,
1300,0.97,7796.321,7811.069,As far as next steps we're working toward the goal to issue a draft proposal with the environmental review by the end of the year.,346,,
1301,0.97,7811.069,7812.137,So that concludes our briefing.,346,,
1302,0.97,7812.137,7813.906,I'll be happy to answer any questions.,346,,
1303,0.97,7813.906,7826.718,"If you just want to stick on slide 12, this is the most In- depth comprehensive bill we've received.",347,,
1304,0.97,7826.718,7837.229,"I'd like to recognize Councilmember Pedersen's work to introduce legislation to this affect, which I was a happy cosponsor to.",347,,
1305,0.97,7837.229,7843.969,"In December, you're noting developing draft recommendations for environmental review for public comment.",347,,
1306,0.97,7843.969,7860.652,"Can we expect to see draft legislation attached to Cepa later this month, or, I guess, mainly my question is, will we be expecting this Sepa review from public comment this month?",347,,
1307,0.97,7860.652,7860.886,Yes.,348,,
1308,0.97,7860.886,7861.153,Great.,349,,
1309,0.97,7861.153,7861.787,Thank you.,349,,
1310,0.97,7861.787,7867.859,"It will be my, Hanukkah's over, but I can still get new year's presents.",349,,
1311,0.97,7867.859,7873.031,So that will be my new years present.,349,,
1312,0.97,7873.031,7873.932,"Colleagues, Councilmember Pedersen, nice.",349,,
1313,0.97,7873.932,7874.533,I knew it.,349,,
1314,0.97,7874.533,7875.4,"Councilmember Pedersen, take it away.",349,,
1315,0.97,7875.4,7887.446,"Thank you, chair Strauss, and thank you for your leadership on this issue, and I want to thank Sdci for the presentation.",350,,
1316,0.97,7887.446,7906.999,"I do appreciate you as you consider this Sdci, as you Cnsider this draft legislation, thank you for incorporating, or planning to incorporate the concept of registering the Arborists, or tree service providers.",350,,
1317,0.97,7906.999,7909.468,I do want to caution about the Inlieu fee.,350,,
1318,0.97,7909.468,7910.903,The devil is in the details there.,350,,
1319,0.97,7910.903,7922.314,"We did have the city of Portland appear to tell us about their In-Lieu fee program, and they said it was basically a failure.",350,,
1320,0.97,7922.314,7923.148,They didn't charge enough money.,350,,
1321,0.97,7923.148,7927.052,It was easy for the developers to pay for it.,350,,
1322,0.97,7927.052,7938.664,"If the legislation expands the definition of exceptional trees, and adds significant trees with more clarity, we do appreciate some of the things in the draft.",350,,
1323,0.97,7938.664,7948.607,"If we expand that, which is good, but then we have a very low had in lieu fee it would sort of cancel out that benefit.",350,,
1324,0.97,7948.607,7953.078,"So I just want to caution about how the in lieu fee is applied, and how much it is.",350,,
1325,0.97,7953.078,7962.154,I would actually be in favor of not having an in lieu fee.,350,,
1326,0.97,7962.154,7965.891,And we can find resources to plant additional trees without an in lieu fee.,350,,
1327,0.97,7965.891,7969.895,I wouldn't that to be the only reason we're doing the in lieu fee.,350,,
1328,0.97,7969.895,7977.836,"The timing, thank you, chair Strauss for zeroing in on that.",350,,
1329,0.97,7977.836,7994.219,"Decision on Sepa, I would think we'd also want to have the draft legislation so that we could then see what you're deciding, how you're making the Sepa determination.",350,,
1330,0.97,7994.219,8005.163,"So I just wanted to clarify, are we also going to be getting legislation this month?",350,,
1331,0.97,8005.163,8005.931,Yes.,351,,
1332,0.97,8005.931,8006.932,That is good news.,352,,
1333,0.97,8006.932,8010.669,"In looking at the slide, I wasn't sure.",352,,
1334,0.97,8010.669,8012.904,So thank you for clarifying that.,352,,
1335,0.97,8012.904,8013.305,Appreciate that.,352,,
1336,0.97,8013.305,8015.64,Thank you.,352,,
1337,0.97,8015.64,8018.01,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,353,,
1338,0.97,8018.01,8020.912,We can have further discussions about the in lieu fee.,353,,
1339,0.97,8020.912,8022.814,"As you said, devil's in the details.",353,,
1340,0.97,8022.814,8026.051,If you make it too low it doesn't create the programs you need.,353,,
1341,0.97,8026.051,8030.555,"And if you make it too high, people avoid paying the fee, and avoid the permit.",353,,
1342,0.97,8030.555,8042.567,"At least, that's the discussion I remember from when you had the folks up in Portland, for that brief moment when you were land use chair in December of 2019.",353,,
1343,0.97,8042.567,8048.64,Thank you for inviting me to that Committee in December of 2019.,353,,
1344,0.97,8048.64,8052.677,Now two years ago.,353,,
1345,0.97,8052.677,8053.178,So I appreciate that.,353,,
1346,0.97,8053.178,8054.179,Councilmember Lewis.,353,,
1347,0.97,8054.179,8057.182,"Thank you so, Mr. chair.",354,,
1348,0.97,8057.182,8073.098,"In the spirit of having additional conversations about in lieu fees, I'm Unfortunately going to continue on that thread just really briefly with a few questions that Councilmember Pedersen just shook loose from his line of questioning.",354,,
1349,0.97,8073.098,8080.172,"The first question would be, and maybe this is more appropriate for law at some future date.",354,,
1350,0.97,8080.172,8106.832,"But I do wonder if part of having an in lieu fee structure is important to avoid some potential vulnerability of Implicating a taking potentially, a regulatory taking and providing alternative methods to perform, hence an in lieu fee, and whether that's an obstacle that we're concerned about, or seeking to navigate in how we craft this policy.",354,,
1351,0.97,8106.832,8130.689,"Then sort of in that same spirit, my question would be if there could be a way to potentially design an in lieu fee in a layered sort of way, where a developer would have to demonstrate exhaustion of alternative methods of mitigating the impact of the tree ordinance.",354,,
1352,0.97,8130.689,8153.044,"For example, you know, not putting in on-site parking, and maybe some provision that it could be waived to protect trees and facilitate a design to accommodate the full bulk of the development, that maybe at the expense of parking.",354,,
1353,0.97,8153.044,8167.993,"Just throwing out some of those ideas to see if there might be an answer to some of those concepts now, and certainly looking forward to talking about that more as part of this policy part of this discussion.",354,,
1354,0.97,8167.993,8176.201,"Great questions, Councilmember Lewis, I would say, let's save those for when we have a draft for us in early next year.",355,,
1355,0.97,8176.201,8185.81,"I just want to recognize, because we're able to have this conversation about in lieu fees is only due to the fact that Chanda has presented a number of different strategies.",355,,
1356,0.97,8185.81,8191.716,We have not gotten to this level of detail in the previous reports from Sdci.,355,,
1357,0.97,8191.716,8193.518,So thank you for that.,355,,
