94,0.97,376.909,382.648,It does remain the strong I tent to have public comment.,65,,
95,0.97,382.648,399.832,However the city council does reserve the right to end or eliminate the comment periods at any point if we deem the system is being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a matter that we can conduct our business.,65,,

247,0.97,1466.398,1475.24,But the law cannot apply retroactively to violations that had already occurred if they had.,95,,
248,0.97,1475.24,1497.596,"So I think going forward, once these go into effect, folks will be on notice this is a potential impact but, you know we're seeing if maybe it makes sense to reissue the orders or to somehow modify them to be in compliance.",95,,
249,0.97,1497.596,1507.272,"But it is, it may not be necessary but that might be a question for the city attorney's office and central staff as well.",95,,

321,0.97,1774.739,1777.242,You received background information and I'm going share a few more details.,145,,
322,0.97,1777.242,1787.919,This land was their home and this was also their family farm where they grew and sold produce and vegetables to the community.,145,,
323,0.97,1787.919,1796.027,As you heard they also donated decorative trees whether there was a new school or other civic activity.,145,,
324,0.97,1796.027,1822.987,Unfortunately the Hayashi family lost their farm when they were interned after World War II.,145,,
325,0.97,1822.987,1843.975,"So Hayden brought this history to the community to the attention of the community, the Lake City community and provided us with the background information about the Hayashi family, their land, their home and their farm and their contributions to the greater North Seattle community.",145,,
326,0.97,1843.975,1855.787,"Therefor, and after, community leaders formed an exploratory committee to attempt to recognize the Hayashi family using s DOT honorary Street named program, thank you Sdot.",145,,
327,0.97,1855.787,1870.768,Community member reached out to an organization committed to preserving American-Chinese community in the region.,145,,

330,0.97,1892.123,1905.703,"Another community leader our friend Chris Leverson, let's build Lake City together, began asking for financial support from local businesses and the committee started a go fund me for the manufacturing costs for the project.",145,,
331,0.97,1905.703,1915.78,"In just under a 24 hours as I shared this morning, they reached their fund raising goals the generosity over 30 contributions.",145,,
332,0.97,1915.78,1926.958,So the community we hoped will be holding unveiling ceremony and the public is encouraged to join while following the public health safety protocols of course.,145,,
333,0.97,1926.958,1933.798,I've been told that the granddaughter Bonnie of the Hayashi family will be in attendance so I'm happy to hear that.,145,,
334,0.97,1933.798,1938.87,We're working with the community to find a date to honor the Hayashi family.,145,,
335,0.97,1938.87,1943.675,You heard me say we're hoping it might be the 25th of this month but I'll let you know.,145,,
336,0.97,1943.675,1971.536,"Just as a side NOTE as we've talked about this for years and particularly in this Council and particularly in our Committee, this is an example of when you recognize the past and our past wrongs and you address the truth and the history and you offer just a simple humane gesture recognizing of a family, the Hayashi family and just changing the street name to really reflect the history of that place.",145,,
337,0.97,1971.536,1979.444,That sometimes truth and healing goes a long way.,145,,

352,0.97,2044.842,2053.885,"You know just going through the city, and actually being honest and Renaming the places and honoring what really happened there or didn't happen there.",149,,
353,0.97,2053.885,2073.004,It is akin to just telling the truth and telling the history that we are on indigenous land and also that there are other people here that have a history that have been erased and their families have not been recognized or honored.,149,,
354,0.97,2073.004,2084.549,With that I would love to hear from other community groups and stories we learned and Realitily a big thank you to Hayden for bringing this to the community.,149,,

425,0.97,2467.298,2487.651,And it is possible because the Rainier Beach community has spent so many years advocating to advance for example as Council member Morales said the food center in the neighborhood while also investing in affordable housing and we're doing this through the equitable development lens to ensure good jobs for community members.,179,,
