6,0.97,122.689,136.87,"With that, I will move into signing of letters and prop locations--Councilmember Strauss do you want to go ahead and lead the --",4,,
7,0.97,136.87,171.204,Colleagues we have a proclamation before us regarding a person who has staff the 3RD and 2ND floors here at City Hall working for many different entities within the 2ND and 3RD floors I am being a little Bitcoin because this is supposed to be a surprise once it is delivered so if you do see in your Emails and I am sure on the official--happy to answer any questions of my colleagues.,5,,
8,0.97,171.204,186.319,"I guess with that we will go, will there not be any discussion about the proclamation before I can request signatures to be affixed?",6,,
9,0.97,186.319,197.03,"I am happy to say more, I guess I look to the clerks if I am required to say more or if you want me to stop being coy and come out with a surprise --",7,,
10,0.97,197.03,204.971,I cannot ask you to affixed their signature unless they know what the proclamation is about.,8,,
11,0.97,204.971,211.411,I believe it was circulated to all offices as per your rules.,9,,
12,0.97,211.411,211.844,Okay.,10,,
13,0.97,211.844,242.508,"So this individual has served the city clerk's office and the city council's office has worked for Mayors, has worked for Councilmembers, has made an improvement upon everyone's lives around here, I would say if there are more questions I am happy to answer them or the proclamation should also be in --",11,,
14,0.97,242.508,258.958,"I guess what I am getting at is that in order to ask people to affixed their signature to the proclamation you might have to say, is there anymore you want to add?",12,,
15,0.97,258.958,296.529,"If you need me to be a little bit more specific I am happy to do so I was hoping to surprise this person since we are not bringing them to the full city council meeting or the Council briefing colleagues in the past have been able to do this in a little bit less of a formal way, where the individual could show up at the end of the Council meeting and be presented it there, but because we are now working in a remote faction it is a little bit more awkward Council President I am looking for you to tell me that I just have to be out with it, Yeah?",13,,
16,0.97,296.529,308.875,"The reason why is in order to lead the discussion on the proclamation and ask your colleagues to sign, they would need to know who it is about, and if they want to add anything, and we can sign it, add to it.",14,,
17,0.97,308.875,398.498,"Sure, I guess colleagues I will be a little bit more out with it, I guess I am a little bit nervous that this person is watching our briefing,--and the reason I am trying to be coy is because I do know that all offices have received this and so they do know what they are signing, so this is a proclamation to honor the work of--who has worked with the front desk for the Seattle city council for--for myself for--and has recently accepted a job with the human services Department, and she has the unique thing about her is she has not served just one Councilmember, she has served all Councilmembers on the floor and Councilmember Mosqueda I was flipping through some memories and while you were being sworn in I have a Video of her Affixing your Nameplate to the door alongside--and so this is just--I was trying to be coy because it is harder birthday next month and so I was trying to surprise her with this, so the cat is out of the bag so colleagues I would love for your signature.",15,,
18,0.97,398.498,422.622,"Are there any of our colleagues who want to share anything with our colleague Lena who has served us well at the front desk and--and she is a dear friend and has done great and we are happy that she has gone to another Department on the mayors side, so starting with anyone who would like to--before I ask you to affix your signatures?",16,,
19,0.97,422.622,453.119,"-- you were so good about these proclamations I know you wanted to keep it a surprise, but surprise, great surprise anyway, and I am sure it is well received, but you are a great example of a high road employer and very thankful that you are doing this and we are thrilled that we will continue to be able to work with you thank you for Affixing that Nameplate --",17,,
20,0.97,453.119,461.26,Are we declaring a day --,18,,
21,0.97,461.26,469.802,"It will be--day on March 4, 2022 which is her birthday.",19,,
22,0.97,469.802,478.11,"Okay, well the first round is on Strauss.",20,,
23,0.97,478.11,492.525,Now that we have that and now that we know the proclamation for signature you know what you are going to sign--we have already gotten our feedback so with that clerk will you please call the roll to determine what Councilmembers would like their signatures affixed to the proclamation?,20,,
24,0.97,492.525,493.993,[roll being called],21,,
25,0.97,514.046,523.022,Nine in favor.,22,,
26,0.97,523.022,545.678,"Thank you, the proclamation passes, so with that we are going to move to item number 4 on our agenda that is the state legislative session up date and I know that you all received our memo from our folks at Oir on update from what we discussed last week so with that I will let Gael Tarleton take over and introduce her team and we will go ahead with the overview.",23,,
27,0.97,545.678,584.35,"Thank you Council President, I am delighted to bring forth today to members of our team who I think many of you have met in the past are Federal affairs director Sierra and our Federal contract office Leslie and I will have them start with giving you an update on all things in the other Washington maybe a Subset of all things in the other Washington and then Elsa Brown will give you an update on what will be a final fast week of session before policy cut off on February 3, so Sierra, why don't you kick it off?",24,,
28,0.97,584.35,585.217,Thank you.,25,,
29,0.97,585.217,679.945,"-- just wanted to do a quick Intro and Leslie has been in front of most of you but there are a couple of folks she has not met so I wanted to give her an opportunity to introduce yourself and--but before we get into what will be a very brief Federal update, I am happy to answer any questions from you all I just wanted to highlight I know I touched on it briefly in the past but we have been working through a strategic plan for Federal funding Federal grants and some of the anticipated funding that we are hoping comes out of the Federal Government, a lot is still to be depending on votes and appropriations and a lot of movement in DC but we are hoping to have some positions and some staffing that will really inform the process and have some high-level thinking around how the city is applying the funding in relationships that we are working with both regionally and statewide and--and just maximizing the cities opportunities and ability to apply for that funding so we will be updating you all more once that procedure or process is in place and we are running through that and I do not know if--but we are looking to the mayors office for some guidance around some of Oir's recommendations and we hope to have more updates for you all on that process as well very shortly.",25,,
30,0.97,679.945,694.06,"So if there are no questions around that, I will kick it over to my colleague and our Federal lobbyist Leslie who will give us a quick--update this week.",25,,
31,0.97,694.06,753.285,"Thank you so much Sarah thank you Gail and thank you Council President Juarez so nice to see everybody and hopefully we will find some time this year--just a couple of updates here, this week both the house and Senate are back in session, the Senate is going to be really focused on nominations, getting through both judicial nominations and also nominations for various Federal agencies, I also wanted to note that the Senate is going to be taking up a concurrent resolution that is being sponsored by--that September 30 should be--on the House side, the house is going to be working through the competes Act and as many of you know last summer the Senate on a bipartisan basis past the U.S.",26,,
32,0.97,753.285,763.496,Innovation and competition act which is a broad far-reaching piece of legislation that aims to address the U.S.,26,,
33,0.97,763.496,831.363,"Competitiveness with China across a wide variety of Metrics and it invests in--it also puts some parameters around U.S. relations with China, it provides significant funding for--as well, the House has finally unveiled their own legislation it is not bipartisan it is equally Far- reaching and in addition to--and so creates a new Telecom workforce investment program also includes the National apprenticeship act which includes funding for apprenticeships also creates funding for the tact program which had been created through--so a number of really Far- reaching and expansive bills.",26,,
34,0.97,831.363,875.04,"The rules Committee is supposed to take this bill up tomorrow, it is unclear whether or not this is going to pass the house at this time, there is at least two Democrats who have come out against the bill and as you all know, there is really no margin to spare in the house, but they are going to try very hard to get this through, Senator Schumer said that this is really one of his highest priorities is to then conference this legislation and bring it back for a vote and that is supposed to happen by Memorial day, at the same time that they are working on this, they are also trying to get through appropriations funding, as many of you know the Federal fiscal year ended September 30 and they are now working on fiscal year 2022, we are now in a continuing resolution.",26,,
35,0.97,875.04,885.417,Through February 18.,26,,
36,0.97,887.086,932.865,"And that is significant because of for a few reasons one the city has Earmarks that are in the House bill that would be very beneficial in addition as Sierra alluded to, there is some funding for the infrastructure and investment and jobs act that is also included in the appropriations bill so it has made it very challenging for the administration to fully implement the bipartisan infrastructure law, because they do not actually have funding to hire the enormous number of people they need to actually do the work to get grants on the ground, that said, and I will touch on this in greater detail in a moment the administration is pushing forward anyway as Sierra may have shared with you already the White House put out a very comprehensive guide to all of the programs in the bipartisan infrastructure law, and D.O.T.",26,,
37,0.97,932.865,956.355,"Has begun rolling out some of their notice of funding opportunities, Department of Commerce has also released notices for comment as has Department of energy and I will NOTE as Sierra mentioned it is a very collaborative group within the city working on that, and so for example recently if D.O.T.",26,,
38,0.97,956.355,977.276,And--to submit comments on the--so the city by providing--from the agency.,26,,
39,0.97,978.077,1038.203,"In terms of Billback better which is the last piece and that is the human capital infrastructure--it fell apart in December when Senator Manchin said he could not--there are quiet conversations that are happening with Senator Manchin, we are hoping that we will hear something this week about what a new deal will look like it has become very clear that the House passed Billback better act is not what will be signed into law but there is hope that some portions of that law will be incorporated into a more streamlined slimmed down version--some of the climate measures there is some hope that perhaps--could be some form of the child tax credit that could be included so those conversations are happening we are watching that very closely as well.",26,,
40,0.97,1038.203,1087.519,"And of course finally in the back half of all of this is Supreme Court nominations, Biden said he will announce his nomination by the end of% February, I think Democrats are all praying with baited breath that nothing happens to any Senator at this time, they are living in protective bubbles for the next few months, but that of course is going to start to have a real impact on relationships in Congress as if they are not already frayed enough coupled with an election year so we have a narrow window right now in these next few months of spring to get things done, and then things will start to fall apart possibly even worse than they have right now.",26,,
41,0.97,1087.519,1090.989,I will stop on that NOTE and see if there are any questions that we can answer.,26,,
42,0.97,1090.989,1092.157,I have a question Leslie.,27,,
43,0.97,1092.157,1110.843,"So on the build back better, and--so I am guessing you are not any closer to knowing how that is going to work or how that is going to roll out we will just sit for a while or --",27,,
44,0.97,1110.843,1159.191,"I do not think they have a lot of time and with the backdrop of the Supreme Court nomination there, and with the 2022 being an election year I think there is a real realization that if they are going to do something it needs to be soon one piece to reflect on in terms of breaking it out in different component parts is really in order to do anything they have to do it through reconciliation and they do not get many lights up that apple in fact they only have one for this year they might be able to do a second one on fy 23, but they have really got one chance at this so I know there were lots of reports about trying to break it up but in terms of the things that they actually want to pass they have got one shot at it so that is going to be the hard part in this.",28,,
45,0.97,1159.191,1162.661,Think you does anyone have any questions for Leslie?,29,,
46,0.97,1162.661,1165.297,Okay I am not seeing any so do you want to continue Leslie?,29,,
47,0.97,1165.297,1216.014,I would just mention that Sierra had said there is the name of the game right now is going to be things around the infrastructure implementation bill so we have been working really closely with departments with the process that Gail and Sierra set up to make sure that they are Commenting on every opportunity before them so that they can help shape those opportunities they have been meeting with departments we think that the city should be well positioned given the Biden administration's priorities which really across all departments--focused on equity they have got the--initiative as you know climate change and then really programs that have the support of labor as well is going to be a priority particularly in D.O.T.,30,,
48,0.97,1216.014,1223.755,Looking at priority higher priority hire arrangements and--for what should be successful here.,30,,
49,0.97,1223.755,1226.391,Okay.,31,,
50,0.97,1226.391,1339.371,"Madam President we would like to make sure that all of you and our community know that the state Legislature is zooming right ahead both actually on zoom and literally in the legislative process and this coming week is the cut off of policy bills out of the house and the Senate, and so we are going to see our narrowing down of which bills are still in play and so Elsa is going to give you a Snapshot of the pieces of legislation you have been tracking as an audience and as well as visually and I want to preface it by saying thank you to all of the Council members who have made yourselves so available for last-minute testimony for making phone calls for ensuring that the Oir team is able to weigh in when it matters the most and timing is everything I just want to also add that this issue of where Federal funding comes from and when it comes is so closely tied to the state budget process we will have state budgets identified by March 10 with the end of the regular session I do believe it will be on time so this integrating of how we are looking at Federal funding and state funding and local funding is really important right now so I will look forward to the Oir team to be helping all of you accomplish that goal of our budget priorities and what we expect to see from funding and so Elsa will give you an update on what we think are some of the main themes coming through as policy cut off arrives.",32,,
51,0.97,1339.371,1411.576,Thank you all appreciate the chance--so as Gail mentioned we are approaching policy cut off so if bills do not make it out of their original policy by the third they are typically dead for the year that is never 100% true there is a process called--one of the key priorities for many legislators this year--the governor signed HB 1732 and HB 1733 halting a payroll tax collection--and creating an exemption from the payment of premiums for certain people so that was a big priority for legislators from the beginning of session and they got it through quite quickly to the governor's desk and so that was encouraging for them to see and for them to get done.,33,,
52,0.97,1411.576,1434.432,So after a policy cut off we will shortly thereafter have physical fiscal cutoffs--and they have to make it out of--committees by February 7 so that his ways and means in the Senate and appropriations and transportation in the House so you know they will be continuing to be weeded out not just on the third but in the coming week.,33,,
53,0.97,1434.432,1465.931,So Council President Warez asked us to focus our--and we continue to be completely open to learning to about new priorities so if there is something--happy to do that but we will be focusing a bit of the conversation today on the governor's housing proposals.,33,,
54,0.97,1465.931,1598.163,"In December the governor announced a large suite of funding in the governor's budget for housing and homelessness these priorities included money for the rapid acquisition of affordable housing and for shelter and utility Arrearages so we are--on those budget items that the governor identified and believe me it would be very helpful for the city--we think it would be quite competitive to get some of that in the city of Seattle in addition to budget items the governor also announced policy items including--legislation that many of you have contacted our office about and are aware of, so the governor request bills are--sponsored by--there are several other additional pieces of legislation that touch on statewide zoning introduced by--the chair of the--we do anticipate--so last week the Senate passed 56 scented--the bill made several changes in that committee but one of the most important as far as the city of Seattle is concerned was the bill was amended to provide--as Seattle does through Mha and--but it does provide the city's clear authority to do so if they choose.",33,,
55,0.97,1598.163,1635.133,The House is scheduled to exact 1782 tomorrow in the local government committee we do not have a final version of that legislation that will be considered for executive session although we do anticipate that the House version will have significant changes from what the governor introduced so that is the current status of the bills and we do expect that both of those may be moving out of committee and considered in fiscal committees after the third.,33,,
56,0.97,1635.133,1639.404,So that was just 1782 and House bill 1981 correct those two?,34,,
57,0.97,1639.404,1647.545,1782 is the House version of the--the Senate version is 5670.,35,,
58,0.97,1647.545,1676.908,1981 is representative--bite at this conversation and we expect that some of the concepts that he considered in that--we have not seen a final version of the substitute --,35,,
59,0.97,1676.908,1683.848,So we will get an update from you before Friday so we can discuss again on Monday?,36,,
60,0.97,1683.848,1684.049,--,37,,
61,0.97,1684.049,1689.354,Go ahead.,38,,
62,0.97,1689.354,1693.425,"That was it, thank you.",39,,
63,0.97,1693.425,1700.732,Colleagues is there anyone who has any questions for Leslie Elsa or Sierra?,40,,
64,0.97,1700.732,1703.968,There we go.,40,,
65,0.97,1703.968,1706.204,Councilmember Mosqueda.,40,,
66,0.97,1706.204,1714.746,I cannot let you down.,41,,
67,0.97,1714.746,1810.675,"I just wanted to say thank you to both the teams and this Washington and the other Washington, I think the reports highlight the importance of the investments in infrastructure both human infrastructure and the Brick-And-Mortar infrastructure and I know that is--very nicely outlined and looking forward to working with these teams as we get legislation over the finish line to address the infrastructure needs for both individuals and our city, and really appreciate the work you all have been doing and excited as well as I was mentioning to Leslie and--we were able to reference a national League of cities report that--to lift the floor on important policies like housing and zoning so that cities can still respond locally by having a great partner in--to help build upon that floor quite literally build upon the floors that they are--so I just wanted to say thank you and looking forward to working with you to get so much more done this year and appreciate our congressional delegation and--respond to this moment and I know that we are all eager to make sure that the dollars we have received are implemented appropriately and --",41,,
68,0.97,1830.461,1840.505,Thank you for your time thank you for your work and we will continue to keep you posted as a policy cut off will give us a much clearer picture.,42,,
69,0.97,1840.505,1843.675,"We will look forward to that, thank you so much for your time.",42,,
70,0.97,1843.675,1848.68,Great so good seeing you Leslie I will talk to you Offline.,43,,

72,0.97,1852.016,1854.118,Councilmember Herbold.,45,,
73,0.97,1854.118,1900.565,"I think--as well as I would like to be, I was, I thought Council President Juarez you were seeking comment on the housing bills that and but not it sounds like we are wrapping up the entire--I did not have any--appreciate the conversations I've have been having with Oir and Councilmember Mosqueda on those two bills but it sounds like we are trying to wrap up the entire conversation about the legislative agenda or --",46,,
74,0.97,1900.565,1909.14,If you have other questions we are done on the legislative session unless you have questions --,47,,
75,0.97,1909.14,1920.318,I thought we were going to be going through additional bills.,48,,
76,0.97,1920.318,1928.86,I appreciate the opportunity to talk about other bills with --,48,,
77,0.97,1928.86,1940.171,We are happy to take them Offline anytime if you would like us to give you a call later on today.,49,,
78,0.97,1940.171,1959.524,"Council President Juarez's understanding I would love to just take the time now, are we changing something about how we go through the legislative agenda I thought we looked at--as sort of a blue sky opportunity to talk about all the bills we are interested in.",50,,
79,0.97,1959.524,2030.194,"We can certainly do that, when we had talked Offline or begun before--we had talked about some of the bills my understanding was that Gail and the team would go over that but remind us that a lot is going to change between now and--you are not going to get to until tomorrow morning it sounds like,--some of them are not going to make it past so you know--so if there is more there that--are you referring to those specific to house bill 1782 and the Senate or the Senate House bill 1880 are those ones in particular because we started off thinking that we would do a compare and contrast--my understanding from the Oir team is a lot of what we know has changed a lot and is going to change even more so I did not want to take up a lot of time knowing that--and they are going to bring it all back to us next Monday.",51,,
80,0.97,2030.194,2046.844,"No, I heard you solicit conversation about those two bills, those are not the bills, --",52,,
81,0.97,2046.844,2050.348,"Go ahead Councilmember Herbold, I apologize.",53,,
82,0.97,2050.348,2070.201,I recognize that there are two different catalytic converter theft bills there is a House bill in the--there is not it is not unusual for there to be two bills but I understand that there are two bills that accomplished different things.,54,,
83,0.97,2070.201,2130.828,And I am wondering if you had information about that and whether or not the city I know that we have signed on in support of a bill focused on requiring marketing or not requiring making marking of catalytic Converters possible and then acquiring a task force but then there is a second bill that relates the requirement for scrap metal and recycling entities to provide documentation similar to what we do for wire theft so one I am just very interested to know what the--whether or not we are supporting that as well and wondering whether or not you have any updates on my request from last week related to looking into whether or not we need to deal with the redemption issue?,54,,
84,0.97,2130.828,2145.61,-- who is sponsoring the House version on--in the context of her legislation.,55,,
85,0.97,2145.61,2191.489,"We also are tracking the Senate version which as you mentioned is not--and contains different provisions I think the inspiration is just--and seeing the need for addressing catalytic converter theft in their communities so we are continuing to track both pieces of legislation--both the house and Senate bills with the hope that one of them will be able to move forward and address some of those concerns that we have, they both are the inspiration I think is similar for the two of them just different angles taking a bite at that apple.",55,,
86,0.97,2191.489,2197.161,Did you have a follow-up?,56,,
87,0.97,2197.161,2199.564,"A follow-up about a separate bill, one more bill?",57,,
88,0.97,2199.564,2209.674,--,58,,
89,0.97,2210.441,2316.414,"-- and that is the bill related to financial obligations sometimes--there was a study done by--a couple years ago the findings as you might expect found that there are negative impacts resulting from--police and traffic officials--and likelihood of triggering effect so stay with LF owes such as the loss of drivers licenses Garnishment of--and the issuing of warrants and further Incarceration, the only thing that the study found is that Seattle municipal Court in his wisdom is waiving almost all of the LF owes that they can waive but there remains to be some state required LF owes that some of them if they could waive them they would others you may not want to do so, my question is in addition to the city's support of this bill and signing on I am wondering if we have engaged with Seattle municipal court on this because this is an area of focus for them and trying to reduce the disparities there and it just seems that an opportunity of our municipal court judges to weigh in on this might be helpful thank you.",59,,
90,0.97,2316.414,2350.281,"Thank you Councilmember, that bill has moved quite well through the process it has passed out of its policy committee already and it has been heard already in the Appropriations Committee so typically with this type of legislation funding and determination of--will be part of what determines whether or not he gets to the end of the process as with many pieces of legislation we send this piece out to our Department counterparts so we have shared it with Seattle municipal court and I am happy to follow up with you more on that.",60,,
