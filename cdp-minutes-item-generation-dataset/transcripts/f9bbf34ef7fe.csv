91,0.97,409.308,414.247,"Coming from the Muslim community myself, we house the largest Mosque in the region.",13,,
92,0.97,414.247,416.549,The Muslim Association of Puget sound.,13,,
93,0.97,416.549,426.259,"And as a community, we're currently facing a need for defense against hate crimes, against discrimination, locally here in our region.",13,,
94,0.97,426.259,431.297,But what we face is not in isolation to the Geopolitics of the world we live in.,13,,
95,0.97,431.297,448.681,"Given the fact that we as a large minority community, large South Asian community, do directly have individuals with family members and folks who are not necessarily citizens of the United States yet but who do require to go back home.",13,,
96,0.97,448.681,455.521,There's an absolute and Pertant need.,13,,
97,0.97,455.521,464.497,As Muslim community member in the city of Redmond I can attest to the fact that that rhetoric has already impacted us here locally in our region.,13,,
98,0.97,464.497,473.239,"Community members of the Muslim community do feel unsafe because of the language that is being spread, because of the hatred, because of the bigotry that's being perpetuated.",13,,

116,0.97,533.099,535.935,My name is Padma.,20,,
117,0.97,535.935,538.07,I'm speaking as a group here.,20,,
118,0.97,538.07,539.071,I love Seattle.,20,,
119,0.97,539.071,544.443,"I did my Undergrad, master's, worked in Seattle and pay tax to the city.",20,,
120,0.97,544.443,549.448,I strongly oppose Councilmember Kshama Sawant's resolution on 31926.,20,,
121,0.97,549.448,553.386,"It is totally misleading, irrelevant, and opposes basic human rights.",20,,
122,0.97,553.386,561.961,I'm here to share my experience on basic human rights which were violated on a flight.,20,,
123,0.97,561.961,567.667,A few years ago my husband and I flew from Saudi Arabia to Bombay due to family emergency.,20,,
124,0.97,567.667,578.611,"We had to take the immediate available Airlines and got into this Unfortunately, totally discriminated situation.",20,,
125,0.97,578.611,584.784,"Our horrible experience as we boarded the flight, and it finally ended once we boarded the flight to Bombay.",20,,
126,0.97,584.784,589.822,Our feelings were terribly hurt.,20,,
127,0.97,589.822,596.028,"We were insulted in many situations, they displayed absolute hatred in every way they could.",20,,
128,0.97,596.028,604.437,"We were the only two Indians on the flight and put in a state of fear, just because we were Hindus and Vegetarians.",20,,
129,0.97,604.437,612.044,"We were denied the vegetarian meal, rudely told we have no such thing, and can offer only Non-Vegetarian.",20,,
130,0.97,612.044,623.723,"With the fellow passengers, the flight attendants loved conversing sarcastically off and on, insulting Hindu values, traditions, and ways of worship, even at the transit lounge.",20,,
131,0.97,623.723,630.129,"Their response was, just one day it's okay to eat meat.",20,,
132,0.97,630.129,641.774,"It was a total display of pure animosity toward Hindus, on Vegetarianism, because we continue our faith on not to eat.",20,,
133,0.97,641.774,662.495,"Having faced this horrifying situation, one can imagine the kind of brutality these 37,000 minority people have gone through each and every day of their lives in all three Islamic countries, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh.",20,,
134,0.97,662.495,668.401,My conclusion is deserving minorities a basic right to live.,20,,
135,0.97,668.401,670.836,Do what's needed for Seattle and the United States.,20,,
136,0.97,670.836,674.54,Thank you and God bless America.,20,,

139,0.97,685.217,687.92,"This at the end, if you support it, that will keep us moving.",21,,
140,0.97,687.92,690.99,Welcome and thank you for waiting.,21,,
141,0.97,690.99,691.19,Rahm?,21,,
142,0.97,691.19,696.128,I'm part of a group so I'm speaking for my Peek.,22,,
143,0.97,696.128,696.629,"Good afternoon, council.",22,,
144,0.97,696.629,705.237,"As somebody who does business in the city, I urge you to vote against this resolution.",22,,
145,0.97,705.237,707.84,I'm going to talk about two of them.,22,,
146,0.97,707.84,718.984,There's an allegation that Caa is going to deprive over 200 Million-Plus Muslims of India of their citizenship.,22,,
147,0.97,718.984,719.719,That is false.,22,,
148,0.97,719.719,720.319,That is categorically false.,22,,
149,0.97,720.319,722.922,Caa has nothing to do with Indian citizens.,22,,
150,0.97,722.922,726.125,Not one Indian will lose his or her citizenship because of Caa.,22,,
151,0.97,726.125,730.296,"If that was the case, I'd be on the other side protesting their rights.",22,,
152,0.97,730.296,735.267,Not a single Indian citizen will lose their citizenship.,22,,
153,0.97,735.267,745.678,"Number 2, Caa allows for expedited, fast track Naturalization of government sponsored persecuted minorities from three countries.",22,,
154,0.97,745.678,747.513,The Keyword is government sponsored persecution.,22,,
155,0.97,747.513,753.219,"And in this three countries, it's only Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists.",22,,
156,0.97,753.219,758.824,"They are the people that are persecuted, they're converted, they're murdered.",22,,
157,0.97,758.824,764.663,They lack even the basic necessities and opportunities.,22,,
158,0.97,764.663,768.334,"So I ask you, did they deserve to be killed because of their religion?",22,,
159,0.97,768.334,775.808,Are they the children of a lesser God?,22,,
160,0.97,775.808,776.208,"No, Ms. Sawant.",22,,
161,0.97,776.208,778.31,Those Refugeees deserve no less than you.,22,,
162,0.97,778.31,780.279,They're part of the one humanity.,22,,
163,0.97,780.279,787.353,It's also alleged that Caa is discriminatory and Fascist because every religious group is not covered by this law.,22,,
164,0.97,787.353,791.891,"Again, I'm sorry, that is the height of hypocrisy.",22,,
165,0.97,791.891,810.176,"I'm sure all of you are aware of the Lautenburg amendment signed, giving fast track access into the United States for persecuted minorities within Iran.",22,,
166,0.97,810.176,811.076,Guess what?,22,,
167,0.97,811.076,813.846,"It's Jews, Christians, and Bahis are covered.",22,,
168,0.97,813.846,815.147,Muslims are not.,22,,
169,0.97,815.147,817.65,They are not subject to government sponsored persecution.,22,,
170,0.97,817.65,821.153,"I ask you, is president Obama a Bigot because of this?",22,,
171,0.97,821.153,823.322,Thank you very much.,23,,
172,0.97,823.322,826.725,"So Ms. Sawant, he's not a Bigot.",24,,
173,0.97,826.725,828.327,This resolution is bigoted.,24,,
174,0.97,828.327,829.828,Okay.,25,,
175,0.97,829.828,831.363,Appreciate it.,25,,
176,0.97,831.363,832.364,The next person is Champad.,25,,
177,0.97,832.364,839.505,"And as a reminder to folks, if you're coming up as groups, the folks who are with you can't also speak later on.",25,,
178,0.97,839.505,842.508,So they're making a decision to speak as well.,25,,
179,0.97,842.508,847.947,I'm in a group.,26,,
180,0.97,847.947,848.147,Sorry.,26,,

182,0.97,848.447,848.814,Good afternoon.,26,,

184,0.97,851.684,854.453,I came here to show some facts.,26,,
185,0.97,854.453,857.456,"In 2001, the party came to power in Bangladesh.",26,,
186,0.97,857.456,863.162,"As soon as they came to power, rampage of persecution started against minority.",26,,
187,0.97,863.162,872.037,"12 years old, a Hindu girl was gang raped and her helpless mother was crying, please rape her one by one.",26,,
188,0.97,872.037,872.838,She's too young.,26,,
189,0.97,872.838,874.573,Otherwise she will die.,26,,
190,0.97,874.573,879.745,"During that time, 10,000 rape cases were documented in Bangladesh.",26,,
191,0.97,879.745,885.784,Imagine the scenario of minorities in the entire country.,26,,
192,0.97,885.784,889.455,Similar things happened in 1990 as well.,26,,
193,0.97,889.455,896.328,"I have personally witnessed, experienced those horrible days in 2001 where we feel hostile in our own country.",26,,
194,0.97,896.328,899.431,As we can't say anything on social media or anywhere.,26,,
195,0.97,899.431,904.37,"Those who are opposing Caa, I just wanted to ask them a simple question.",26,,
196,0.97,904.37,912.845,"Did those poor persecuted minorities who were already staying in India for 20 to 30 years, did they get Indian citizenship?",26,,
197,0.97,912.845,913.145,Yes or no?,26,,
198,0.97,913.145,926.625,"If the answer is no, then Caa is a policy made by Indian government for poor persecuted, to give citizenship to Jews during World War II.",26,,
199,0.97,926.625,927.326,Why Muslims are not included?,26,,
200,0.97,927.326,936.335,Because persecuted Muslims don't want to go to India.,26,,
201,0.97,936.335,938.17,I have Bangladesh.,26,,
202,0.97,938.17,942.241,They also face persecution.,26,,
203,0.97,942.241,943.942,The persecuted went to Iran.,26,,
204,0.97,943.942,949.415,Bangladesh gives shelters to 5 million Rohingyas.,26,,
205,0.97,949.415,953.619,Europe and U.S. also give asylum to Rohingyas.,26,,
206,0.97,953.619,958.023,"But these poor persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Afghanistan they have no place to go except India.",26,,
207,0.97,958.023,963.829,"Can you show me any poor persecuted minorities, anywhere Úin the world except India?",26,,
208,0.97,963.829,965.364,The answer is no.,26,,
209,0.97,965.364,968.167,I request everyone to take decision based on this scenario.,26,,
210,0.97,968.167,970.569,"Aretha, please read the next three names.",27,,

224,0.97,1002.401,1009.875,It's my plea to you all.,35,,
225,0.97,1009.875,1016.815,India Caa is a path to citizenship.,35,,
226,0.97,1016.815,1017.883,Now who are they?,35,,
227,0.97,1017.883,1025.224,The Islamic nations of Pakistan and Bangladesh had 23% of the population of the religious minority.,35,,
228,0.97,1025.224,1028.427,Today these numbers Dwindleded in Pakistan to less than 3%.,35,,
229,0.97,1028.427,1037.269,"I want to ask Council, how do you think they lost 20% of the minority population?",35,,
230,0.97,1037.269,1042.007,India proudly grew its population from 15% to 22% during the same period of time.,35,,
231,0.97,1042.007,1059.892,"I want to ask Council, how many prime ministers and Presidents did Pakistan, Bangladesh have that belong to minority community, while India had several Presidents, Prime ministers, and top leaders from Sikh, Christian, and Muslim community.",35,,
232,0.97,1059.892,1073.539,"I want to ask Council, do you know how many religious minority people are killed, jailed, and punished under the laws?",35,,
233,0.97,1073.539,1081.28,Does that not tell us a glaring story on Pakistan's minority rights?,35,,
234,0.97,1081.28,1100.632,"Hence I urge the Council to be laser focused on the laws, its intentions, and not get taken away with any preconceived notions of India's leaders or news articles.",35,,
235,0.97,1100.632,1110.075,Caa Seattle cannot be on the wrong side of the history.,35,,
236,0.97,1110.075,1114.246,Please don't with this.,35,,

240,0.97,1115.28,1124.089,"As someone who does business in Seattle and takes pride in showing Seattle to visiting friends and family, I ask you to oppose 31926.",37,,
241,0.97,1124.089,1131.196,Pakistan was created from undivided India in 1947 as per the desire of the leader of the Muslim.,37,,
242,0.97,1131.196,1137.436,"Muslims crossed over to Pakistan and many Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and others crossed over into the newly divided India.",37,,
243,0.97,1137.436,1140.973,Some of them were unable to cross into India.,37,,
244,0.97,1140.973,1148.213,"Today them Mahatma Gandhi said, and I quote, if they feel unsafe and wish to come to India in the future, they can come at any time without hesitation.",37,,

246,0.97,1156.722,1157.022,End quote.,37,,
247,0.97,1157.022,1162.895,"Dear Councilmembers, all the Caa does is fulfill that overdue promise.",37,,
248,0.97,1162.895,1165.964,Ms. Sawant's resolution conveniently ignores this truth.,37,,
249,0.97,1165.964,1177.943,"From 1941 to 2015, the Hindu population in Pakistan, for example, has dwindled from 15% to less than 3% due to rape, forced conversions and other human rights violations.",37,,

258,0.97,1197.129,1206.271,It's welcome as a group but it has to be three separate people and people have already taken their time to come up.,38,,
259,0.97,1206.271,1209.441,"Go ahead, Michael.",38,,
260,0.97,1209.441,1211.543,Right after Aretha--what's that?,38,,

263,0.97,1218.917,1220.252,"Oh, that's a shame.",40,,
264,0.97,1220.252,1224.156,"I'm going to let you speak as a group, but I want to be really clear with folks.",40,,
265,0.97,1224.156,1226.258,The group is intended to allow multiple people to speak.,40,,
266,0.97,1226.258,1232.097,I appreciate what you have to say and I'm sorry that that was not clear.,40,,
267,0.97,1232.097,1236.802,But only the three people who have not come up before can come up and speak as a group.,40,,
268,0.97,1236.802,1239.304,We're also happy to take written testimony.,40,,
269,0.97,1239.304,1242.341,"Aretha, can you read the three people to come up after Michael?",40,,
270,0.97,1242.341,1251.283,"After Michael will be Padma Ayala, Shiva--I cannot say the last night.",41,,

275,0.97,1259.825,1266.131,And it may be unique to almost everyone in this room.,43,,
276,0.97,1266.131,1274.039,Basically I have three direct immediate relatives put into internment camps here in Washington just for being Japanese-Americans.,43,,
277,0.97,1274.039,1279.244,So it hits home when I hear about minorities suffering.,43,,
278,0.97,1279.244,1286.285,"Also I worked with NASA, the native Americans students Association in Oregon to build their college.",43,,
279,0.97,1286.285,1293.425,I've dedicated my life to indigenous struggle and to help make up for the debt.,43,,
280,0.97,1293.425,1299.631,So basically I went to India to see the condition of these Bangladeshi refugees for myself.,43,,
281,0.97,1299.631,1304.469,I wanted to see on the ground what they were going through.,43,,
282,0.97,1304.469,1305.937,What was their experiences.,43,,
283,0.97,1305.937,1315.213,And I was horrified to see they're totally neglected and they have no land so they build homes hanging over sewage canals.,43,,
284,0.97,1315.213,1316.515,I asked them where's amnesty?,43,,
285,0.97,1316.515,1317.683,Where's the United Nations?,43,,
286,0.97,1317.683,1318.717,Where's the Indian government?,43,,
287,0.97,1318.717,1319.618,No one is helping them.,43,,
288,0.97,1319.618,1322.12,I haven't been able to do anything to help them.,43,,
289,0.97,1322.12,1332.397,"When I heard about this bill, it was the first Ray of hope in their lives that now they're getting full citizenship, like every other Indian in the country of India.",43,,
290,0.97,1332.397,1335.701,"So for me, it was great news and it touched my heart.",43,,
291,0.97,1335.701,1341.373,"Then when I started seeing the protests and all that, I was confused about it.",43,,
292,0.97,1341.373,1346.078,Because I understand everyone's here and they're very sincere in their humanitarian efforts.,43,,
293,0.97,1346.078,1349.781,I have good news to share with all of you.,43,,
294,0.97,1349.781,1357.789,"The fact is in 2015, the government gave almost 15,000 Bangladeshi Muslims citizenship.",43,,
295,0.97,1357.789,1364.496,"In India in 2015, years before this Caa bill came about.",43,,
296,0.97,1364.496,1368.6,These rumors and these lies going on is false.,43,,
297,0.97,1368.6,1372.704,"All of you, this is good news.",43,,
298,0.97,1372.704,1373.772,It's something to celebrate.,43,,

308,0.97,1413.078,1415.313,"Yes, I do come from the grassroots.",46,,
309,0.97,1415.313,1422.32,"Before I speak about the Caa, I want to quote what Mahatma Gandhi once said.",46,,
310,0.97,1422.32,1428.493,Minorities of Pakistan who do not wish to live there can come to India.,46,,
311,0.97,1428.493,1432.197,It is the duty to ensure a normal life for them.,46,,
312,0.97,1432.197,1436.968,I'm not quoting Gandhi because he's father of the nation.,46,,
313,0.97,1436.968,1457.155,"He's an inspiration to many but I'm quoting Gandhi because when the entire nation was celebrating India's first independence day, Gandhi was working at the East Pakistan border, immersed in saving the lives of minority Hindus.",46,,
314,0.97,1457.155,1461.193,The Caa is a sign of humanitarian values.,46,,
315,0.97,1461.193,1464.529,It is an extension to India.,46,,

320,0.97,1488.386,1505.804,I hope the Council will not fall prey to the people's greed for power.,46,,
321,0.97,1505.804,1509.808,"Lastly, your vote is a vote against citizenship.",46,,
322,0.97,1509.808,1513.645,The next person is Shiva.,47,,

328,0.97,1549.781,1560.325,India is giving a life of dignity to such minorities who were fortunate enough to skip Pakistan.,48,,
329,0.97,1560.325,1567.132,Unfortunately Ms. Sawant has no regard as they are not her bank.,48,,
330,0.97,1567.132,1575.206,She's feeding her political ambitions on the backs of minorities.,48,,
331,0.97,1575.206,1582.013,"In fact, there are people here today who are from Bangladesh and Pakistan and they're pretending they're from India and not Hindus.",48,,

428,0.97,2114.846,2121.052,And it would affect business and trade with India.,64,,

883,0.97,4700.762,4713.575,"This was the largest strike ever in global labor history, the Bloomberg newspaper reporting that 250 million people from banks and transport services in the city, to farmers in rural areas, stopped work to participate in the strike.",141,,
884,0.97,4713.575,4727.956,"It is telling, that virtually no one who spoke against the resolution had anything to say about the National register of citizens.",141,,
885,0.97,4727.956,4735.997,"Las year in the Indian state of Assam they created an updated register of citizens, NRC.",141,,
886,0.97,4735.997,4752.414,"People were forced to prove they were Indian citizens, and if one had even a modicum of honesty, one would have to call the documentation requirements under the NRC absurd on the face of it, and only logical when you see that it seeks to fulfill the specific agenda of citizenship rights from numbers of people.",141,,
887,0.97,4752.414,4783.145,"The Dan Strauss D--NRC requires if you were born before 1971 like myself, if you were born after 1971 like myself, in other words, if you are younger than 48 years old you must have Pre-1971 documents with your parents and grandparents name on it documenting relationships with your parents and grandparents.",141,,
888,0.97,4783.145,4787.616,"According to these rules, someone like myself who was born after 1971, would actually be unable to provide the required documents.",141,,
889,0.97,4787.616,4804.499,What the government found through the pilot project they did in the Northeastern state of Assam is it is impossible to carry out the NRC without--large number of Hindus stateless--directly on Muslim Indians.,141,,
890,0.97,4804.499,4821.082,"That is the reason for the citizenship amendment at the Caa which gives citizenship without documents to people of some religions, including Hindus, but specifically not to Muslim people.",141,,
891,0.97,4821.082,4828.79,"Because I happen to have a Hindu name, even though I don't have the documents, even though I was born after 1971, I was told my citizenship under the NRC despite not having documentation.",141,,
892,0.97,4828.79,4843.905,The government claims that the Caa is a humanitarian Act and the NRC is nothing to worry about.,141,,
893,0.97,4843.905,4845.207,But the experience in Assam proves otherwise.,141,,
894,0.97,4845.207,4850.579,"Also if the Caa were truly about refugees,--instead of retroactively applying to Peope who Immigrated before 2014?",141,,
895,0.97,4850.579,4867.229,"If the Caa allows--for oppressed religious minorities in neighboring countries, why does it overlook the oppression of the Shia and Muslim population in those countries?",141,,
896,0.97,4867.229,4871.299,Why does it exclude persecuted minorities and other regions?,141,,
897,0.97,4871.299,4885.046,"People who are predominantly Muslim who are facing genocide in my Mr, and Sri Lanka who has the largest refugee group inside India.",141,,
898,0.97,4885.046,4893.021,Our movement truly supports the rights of all refugees regardless of their religions.,141,,
899,0.97,4893.021,4894.656,We do not support overt religious discrimination.,141,,
900,0.97,4894.656,4897.459,I will close my comments for now and would like to comment at the end.,141,,
901,0.97,4897.459,4898.46,Thank you very much.,142,,
902,0.97,4898.46,4909.004,Councilmember Andrew J. Lewis.,142,,
903,0.97,4911.806,4914.576,"This is the first morning, I will give two warnings, I've given a precursor.",142,,
904,0.97,4914.576,4919.214,"We will get through this, please continue to use your hand gestures as you have so we can continue to get through this.",142,,
905,0.97,4919.214,4923.551,Would you like to introduce your amendment?,142,,
906,0.97,4923.551,4925.086,Thank you Madam and President pro Tem.,143,,
907,0.97,4925.086,4934.062,"I seek to introduce an amendment, the only one this afternoon.",143,,
908,0.97,4934.062,4937.565,"To Res 31926, I believe it has been circulated for Councilmembers to consider and review.",143,,
909,0.97,4937.565,4965.593,It adds one clause in section 2 of the resolve sections to change the language--rather to add language for us to be calling on Congress to take action in response to our resolution rather than just sending what we are sending to the Indian government.,143,,
910,0.97,4965.593,4983.845,"The basis for that request is I tend to think when we engage in these resolutions that involve things outside the jurisdiction of the city of Seattle I think it is more in our Wheelhouse when we are calling on our Federal representatives who are charged with negotiations with other countries, international relations, to take the formal action rather than us ourselves to be communicating with the Modi government.",143,,
911,0.97,4983.845,4997.225,I think this amendment helps us to capture the same attitude as the underlying resolution but just making sure we are targeting it towards folks that are in the position to do something about it.,143,,
912,0.97,4997.225,5011.84,"I would add, this might have been a good amendment for a--Congresswoman Paul has been leading on several issues in the house on this.",143,,
913,0.97,5011.84,5023.385,I think actually this is a resolution that would be received probably well by Congressman Paul.,143,,
914,0.97,5023.385,5026.087,That is the basis of the amendment and I do so move it.,143,,
915,0.97,5026.087,5029.691,"In advance of moving the amendment, let me put this on the docket for official consideration.",144,,
916,0.97,5029.691,5035.597,"I'd like to move to adopt Res 31926, is there a second?",144,,
917,0.97,5035.597,5039.267,It has been moved and Seconded that the resolution be adopted.,144,,
918,0.97,5039.267,5052.68,"I'd like to entertain a motion, if you can do that again for me.",144,,
919,0.97,5052.68,5055.717,"I do so move my amendment, Úamendment one, from Res 31926 to be considered.",145,,
920,0.97,5055.717,5059.187,Has been moved and Seconded that resolution be amended as presented in amendment number one.,146,,
921,0.97,5059.187,5065.026,Are there any other comments on amendment number one?,146,,
922,0.97,5065.026,5067.095,"Seeking none, I looked to have us vote on this.",146,,
923,0.97,5067.095,5074.803,Úall those in favor of the amendment as outlined by Councilmember Andrew J. Lewis vote aye and raise your hand.,146,,
924,0.97,5074.803,5075.236,Any oppose?,146,,
925,0.97,5075.236,5075.437,None.,146,,
926,0.97,5075.437,5077.272,Any Abstentions?,146,,
927,0.97,5077.272,5077.472,None.,146,,
928,0.97,5077.472,5088.616,"There are five aye's as I see it up here that means the motion carries, the resolution is adopted.",146,,
929,0.97,5088.616,5093.188,"I'd like to now see if there's any--I'm sorry not the resolution, the amendment is adopted.",146,,
930,0.97,5093.188,5095.957,Thank you very much from the parliamentarians in the room.,146,,
931,0.97,5095.957,5100.528,The amendment has been adopted to the motions.,146,,
932,0.97,5100.528,5107.135,"The amended resolution, Res 31926, I'd like to entertain any further comments on the resolution as amended.",146,,
933,0.97,5107.135,5108.57,I have a comment.,147,,
934,0.97,5108.57,5117.479,Thank you Councilmember Tammy J. Morales.,148,,
935,0.97,5117.479,5123.151,Last week this body passed a resolution that offered a generic condemnation of all current and future oppression happening in the world.,149,,
936,0.97,5123.151,5134.362,"I oppose that resolution, even though it did knowledge that there is oppression happening in India, it was in reference to this resolution.",149,,
937,0.97,5134.362,5146.708,As a Mexican-American woman it is unacceptable to me not to speak out against the tragedy that is happening on our Southern border against families who are desperate to find a better way of life.,149,,
938,0.97,5146.708,5156.117,It is also unacceptable not to speak against targeting on our northern border now as we know folks are being targeted for being Muslim as they come into this country.,149,,
939,0.97,5156.117,5170.098,And I have to say that as a Jew that passed on the anniversary of Auschwitz.,149,,
940,0.97,5170.098,5188.716,"It is important to stand up for--India is a secular country and I have to say that every comment I heard today, most of the comments I heard today had an undertone of religious intolerance.",149,,
941,0.97,5188.716,5190.418,I think we need to speak up against that.,149,,
942,0.97,5190.418,5197.725,"A program that Detains people because of their faith, like our own shameful Muslim man's must be rejected.",149,,
943,0.97,5197.725,5202.063,As elected leaders in our community we have an obligation to speak up against oppression regardless of where it is happening.,149,,
944,0.97,5202.063,5209.47,"I do want to read a quick paragraph from a letter we received from one America this morning, from the executive director rich Stoltz.",149,,
945,0.97,5209.47,5227.589,"It says ""I understand there has been some discussion as to whether Unbinding resolutions condemning oppression and other parts of the world are worth the councils time.",149,,
946,0.97,5227.589,5230.391,To the communities that America works with these issues are extremely close to home.,149,,
947,0.97,5230.391,5234.696,Resolutions like these provide a vital opportunity to demonstrate their communities matter and the world is taking notice of their plate.,149,,
948,0.97,5234.696,5238.499,And for this resolution there is an obvious parallel to these laws and what the current U.S.,149,,
949,0.97,5238.499,5240.969,Federal Government is attempting to achieve in its Federal immigration policies.,149,,
950,0.97,5240.969,5251.913,I think it is important that we ensure that our own Constitution in this country protects people from discrimination especially if they are seeking refuge.,149,,
951,0.97,5251.913,5260.888,And as an elect a leader I think it is our obligation to speak up when we see tragedies happening across the globe.,149,,
952,0.97,5260.888,5266.461,"This resolution URGES India, the largest democracy in the world, to Uploaded secular Constitution Amberjack--policies.",149,,
953,0.97,5266.461,5268.396,"I tend to support it.""",149,,
954,0.97,5268.396,5271.833,"Thank you, are there any other comments?",150,,

958,0.97,5276.938,5298.86,"When this previously became before the Council, having done my own independent research coming having accepted a considerable number of Emails from folks who have been providing feedback on this from the community, you know I am prepared today to vote in favor of this resolution as it has been amended.",151,,
959,0.97,5298.86,5325.286,"It sounds like I'm probably not going to get elected to the--but I have to say that in looking into the issue more and looking into it more in depth a lot of organizations that I am very favorably disposed to have reached similar conclusions on the Caa is what the resolution has adopted . The economist, of which I followed the editorials very closely too, has Editorialized and Opined against the Caa.",151,,
960,0.97,5325.286,5346.808,"You know I did not run for Seattle city Council to pass resolutions regarding International matters, I do not intend in my own practice here on the--to propose resolutions like this.",151,,
961,0.97,5346.808,5352.88,"But the question having been posed to me, the people of district 7 did send me here to vote and offer a position when they do come before me.",151,,
962,0.97,5352.88,5361.022,"There is no other option for me then to support this resolution and call the Caa what it is, I will therefore be voting in favor of the resolution today, and I thank you Councilmembers for bringing this forward.",151,,
963,0.97,5361.022,5362.423,Thank you Councilmember Andrew J. Lewis.,152,,
964,0.97,5362.423,5366.294,Any additional comments?,152,,
965,0.97,5366.294,5377.638,Councilmember Kshama Sawant I believe you would like to close us out?,152,,
966,0.97,5377.638,5386.214,"I will also just go ahead and acknowledge that it has been important, for my perspective, as an elected official, to make sure we are raising issues that are of significance both here at home, nationally, and internationally.",152,,
967,0.97,5386.214,5401.796,"Having both intellect did for the last two years, and also previous to that being an advocate for human rights and labor standards for working families, it is important for--resolutions.",152,,
968,0.97,5401.796,5405.333,Even if it is not within the confines of the borders of the municipality that's being considered.,152,,
969,0.97,5405.333,5434.962,"We have had cities, States, Congress take up resolutions condemning injustice at many different levels, and I would welcome any country who wants to raise questions, condemn U.S. policies of Incarcerating children, of separating families, of enacting wars of aggression, of pursuing oppression and occupation in countries around the world, I welcome that type of criticism when it is in our country.",152,,
970,0.97,5434.962,5450.211,"And I think it is important to raise concerns when we see injustice in other countries, or in other areas, even here in Seattle our words have an important impact across the globe and also locally.",152,,
971,0.97,5450.211,5463.424,"I do want to acknowledge many of the organizations that you have mentioned and also say to folks who both testified today and who have expressed concern, we did receive your messages, and I know many of you have been waiting for a long time to speak.",152,,
972,0.97,5463.424,5480.241,"We also heard from a number of organizations that Councilmember Kshama Sawant mentioned, including individuals who are not able to speak, including those downstairs, I understand you have been waiting a long time to speak, but those who did not get to speak and those downstairs, and I really do appreciate you coming forward.",152,,
973,0.97,5480.241,5492.019,"This is something I think that Councilmember Andrew J. Lewis mentioned to Congresswoman Jaya Paul,--I encourage folks to look at the Washington post.",152,,
974,0.97,5492.019,5499.227,A piece published on December 23rd where she Articulates the concerns around the Caa and the NRC.,152,,
975,0.97,5499.227,5516.377,"So I think this is something that is not an individual pushing a certain resolution, this is a community effort that we have heard from and also at the national level we know there are many people who have raised this issue.",152,,
976,0.97,5516.377,5521.082,"I will be in support of this resolution, I look forward to you closing us out, and we will move to a vote.",152,,
