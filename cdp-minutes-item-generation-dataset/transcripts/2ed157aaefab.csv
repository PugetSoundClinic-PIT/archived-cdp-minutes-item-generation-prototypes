18,0.97,78.645,81.014,A little more on that later.,11,,
19,0.97,81.08,93.593,"We had intended to hearing from the human services Department, on their community engagement efforts that they've conducted in order to develop requests for proposals for community safety capacity investments.",11,,

21,0.97,102.936,115.014,Councilmembers may recall this relates to 2020 summer budget discussions and deliberations to add funding for community safety investments.,11,,
22,0.97,115.081,136.636,"Those, even though we voted on them during the 2020 summer adjusted budget, because the budget was vetoed, those dollars were not spent and instead when we overrode the veto, we also then voted in this year's budget to move those dollars forward.",11,,
23,0.97,136.703,140.907,"So we're, I know, all very eager to get those dollars out the door.",11,,
24,0.97,140.974,163.429,"The human services Department informed us late last week, that they would not be ready for the presentation that we had planned for today, and we expect to hear it on March 9th, instead along with the spend plan itself and the legislation that the Council will have to act on to allow Hsd to release the dollars.",11,,
25,0.97,163.496,169.502,We will now approve our agenda for the committee meeting.,11,,

43,0.97,279.812,296.062,"Good morning, Howard gale, District 7, commenting on accountability . abuse and for most police officers there's nothing more important to them than their authority and ability to use great, and sometimes deadly power to enforce it.",12,,
44,0.97,296.129,318.551,"So how can we be surprised in police if they have no accountability for the beating, gassing, abusing, falsely arresting hundreds of middle class white people last summer, then come to believe they can kill those who have so much less power, and voice [inaudible]. those who are homeless, and/or in severe mental health crisis.",12,,
45,0.97,318.618,330.129,"As was Jay Hayden last week, when the police ended his life 13.5 seconds after arriving on the scene.",12,,
46,0.97,330.196,339.939,"Half of the people killed have wielded a knife, a broken bottle, or no weapon at all.",12,,

70,0.97,429.362,431.898,Good morning Council.,14,,
71,0.97,431.964,452.952,"This is Julia Buck of district 6. in August 2020, the council passed resolution 31962, which said the city council will not support any budget, increase the budget to offset Expendtures above the funds budgeted in 2020 or 2021.",14,,
72,0.97,453.019,460.126,The Reviced budget [inaudible] for overtime.,14,,
73,0.97,460.193,467.099,The SPD spent [inaudible] on overtime.,14,,
74,0.97,467.166,474.607,Gave officers more paid Overtimeshares than their budget would allow.,14,,
75,0.97,474.674,504.37,"Councilmember Herbold herself said cut SPD's 2021 budget to offset the additional $5.4 million is the best way I can think of to hold SPD accountable for its budget overrun according to the ""New York times ."" your own city auditor office identified a quote significant gap in SPD's overtime controls that led to overtime errors and inefficiencies, including looking at payments of overtime.",14,,
76,0.97,504.437,515.982,I cannot Express how disappointing it is that the city council needs three meetings to consider following through on its own promises.,14,,
77,0.97,516.048,517.984,Thank you.,14,,
78,0.97,518.05,536.869,"Thank you, the next Speaker, is Elizabeth Stanton followed by bill Anderson.",15,,

82,0.97,560.826,579.946,"I urge the Council to deduct the Over-Dollars from the 2020 budget from the 2021 budget, and I urge the Council to audit the use and accountability of overtime with the Seattle police Department.",16,,
83,0.97,580.012,585.651,"Again, I want to thank the Council for their courage on this issue.",16,,
84,0.97,585.718,618.05,"And it's a long time issue, and I would call on the citizens of the city to look at the 13 States around the country that are pursuing a similar program of Defunding their police and what the success, or lack of success has been in the communities that have pursued this, and I would particularly urge people to look at Camden, New Jersey.",16,,
85,0.97,618.117,624.49,We have a continued problem of black deaths since George Floyd's death.,16,,
86,0.97,624.557,628.027,I stopped counting at 12 around the country.,16,,
87,0.97,628.094,658.024,"And the continued disrespect by the Seattle police Department has for black lives matter demonstrators, demonstrating peacefully in support of their black neighbors, and the recent comments of the leader of Spag Equivocating the black lives matter movement with the White Supremacist movement.",16,,
88,0.97,658.09,658.657,Demonstrators at January 6th.,16,,

92,0.97,678.477,687.453,But I note that it shows that he is not present.,17,,
93,0.97,687.52,690.623,So just calling for bill Anderson.,17,,
94,0.97,690.689,705.071,"If he's listening and wants to sign back on, but not seeing any evidence of that at this time, I think we will close out public comment.",17,,
95,0.97,705.137,709.475,"With that, let's move into the first item on the agenda.",17,,
96,0.97,709.542,714.98,Will the clerk please read in the first agenda item?,17,,

102,0.97,731.33,731.597,Good morning.,20,,
103,0.97,731.664,739.939,"Councilmember Herbold, Council President Gonzalez, and members of the Council thank you for having me, and the first question I'll ask, is can you see my screen?",20,,
104,0.97,740.005,740.739,Sure can.,21,,
105,0.97,740.806,741.24,"All right, good.",22,,
106,0.97,741.307,755.387,"So thank you for allowing me a few minutes to share a few slides of looking back at 2020 from a perspective of the Seattle fire Department, and in the direction that we're going in 2021.",22,,
107,0.97,755.454,763.395,"As we move forward throughout the new year, one of the things we try to do is hit the refresh button on our North Star.",22,,
108,0.97,763.462,764.797,This is a busy slide.,22,,
109,0.97,764.864,766.866,It contains a lot of information.,22,,
110,0.97,766.932,770.236,"The reason why we're here, or our purpose.",22,,
111,0.97,770.302,770.936,We're here to serve others.,22,,
112,0.97,771.003,778.544,"That's very important for us, and that ties to our mission of saving lives and protecting property and the environment.",22,,
113,0.97,778.611,781.08,"And then, reliving our values.",22,,
114,0.97,781.147,793.659,"Our integrity, team work, compassion, courage and die adversity, we no this is a circular operation, our culture defines our operations.",22,,
115,0.97,793.726,795.828,Our operations should reflect our values.,22,,
116,0.97,795.895,799.331,Our values reflect our beliefs and our organization defines our values.,22,,
117,0.97,799.398,801.901,"So for us, this is really important.",22,,
118,0.97,801.967,809.475,"Then hitting the refresh button on our vision as an organization, a commitment to excellence and being a national leader in everything that we do.",22,,
119,0.97,809.542,815.08,What you see inside of the bulls eye ring here is the darker gray ring.,22,,
120,0.97,815.147,817.183,That's just kind of another refresh.,22,,
121,0.97,817.249,822.821,"Our goals, our ideas, our plans, and our future that we hit the refresh button on the organization.",22,,
122,0.97,822.888,828.627,Then the outer gray ring are our expectations of each other and where we're going as an organization.,22,,
123,0.97,828.694,839.705,"So with the Department, I took a lot longer than I'm taking right now to go over each one of these, but it's important that each year we hit the refresh button on our North store, and our why that we're here.",22,,
124,0.97,839.772,851.083,"So looking back at our incident response over the last five years, we have been tracking down, and that is really, really good, because we have deployed a number of things.",22,,
125,0.97,851.15,854.787,"We have deployed additional aid cars, case managers.",22,,
126,0.97,854.853,864.763,"We have revised our dispatch protocols, and we had a really good downward trend going, and we looked from '19 to '20 and we had a significant downward trend.",22,,
127,0.97,864.83,870.169,What that represented was people not calling 911 for medically related calls.,22,,
128,0.97,870.236,882.348,"We saw that early on and you may remember back in April, may, June, and July, we did a lot of Messaging to the public to let them know that it was safe to call 911 for emergencies.",22,,
129,0.97,882.414,887.219,That's actually where the fall off ask.,22,,
130,0.97,887.286,889.188,Our fire emergencies remain pretty steady.,22,,
131,0.97,889.255,894.727,"Of that 80,000 calls a little over 20,000 were fire related emergencies.",22,,
132,0.97,894.793,901.166,"In 2019, of those 92,000 calls, about 20,000 of those were Fire- related emergencies.",22,,
133,0.97,901.233,905.404,"So our fire calls did not fall off, our EMS calls fell off.",22,,
134,0.97,905.471,908.24,This is how it reflected.,22,,
135,0.97,908.307,912.111,"In the past, our Fire-Related calls were about 20%.",22,,
136,0.97,912.177,914.346,Our EMS related calls were about 80%.,22,,
137,0.97,914.413,919.551,"So we saw the shift in 2020, and we'll see if that holds true.",22,,
138,0.97,919.618,926.492,"We're tracking it from month to month, but that's a significant shift for us related to our responses.",22,,
139,0.97,926.558,931.997,And one of the priorities of the organization is our operations building inspections.,22,,
140,0.97,932.064,939.371,We have a goal each year of getting to 100% of all of our buildings in the city being Independented.,22,,
141,0.97,939.438,942.875,"In 2019, we got to 96% were all completed.",22,,
142,0.97,942.941,948.781,"Of that last 4%, we had been in a number of those buildings, but we didn't gain compliance.",22,,
143,0.97,948.847,962.795,"But in 2020, when we saw the city shut down for months on end, any time that we actually had an opening, our units were out in the field doing building inspections.",22,,
144,0.97,962.861,968.467,"The city was closed for at least half the year, so that made it really challenging for us.",22,,
145,0.97,968.534,975.908,So this year is really important for us to try to get out there and make sure we have a test point for all of those properties that we may not have gotten in.,22,,
146,0.97,975.974,979.712,"In 2020, for a variety of reasons, maybe they close.",22,,
147,0.97,979.778,988.52,Mae Maybe they were closed for the pandemic and all of those different things there.,22,,
148,0.97,988.587,1008.507,"I want to get through the slide, but I want to just say to other Councilmembers that if they have questions, as we move through this, free to raise your hand in the participant's panel I'm watching.",23,,
149,0.97,1008.574,1012.01,And that's looking down a little bit to allow for that.,23,,
150,0.97,1012.077,1018.55,I do have a question about the operations and building inspections slide.,23,,
151,0.97,1018.617,1018.851,Thank you.,23,,
152,0.97,1018.917,1034.533,Can you just take a little bit more time to explain why the Covid-19 crisis had an impact on the number of completed building inspections?,23,,
153,0.97,1034.6,1034.8,Sure.,24,,
154,0.97,1034.867,1035.1,Absolutely.,24,,
155,0.97,1035.167,1041.94,"As we all remember the city pretty much, the nation was closed for long periods of time.",24,,
156,0.97,1042.007,1045.01,That restricted our access to a number of the buildings in the city.,24,,
157,0.97,1045.077,1060.726,"And as more of the businesses created a work from home platform, even when they were opened, they may have been working from home, so we may not have been actually able to gain access to do an inspection in the different buildings around the city.",24,,
158,0.97,1060.793,1073.972,"So as we had windows of light, and I'll just term it as that, where we had different levels of reopening, that's when our units actually went out and tried to get inside the structures, and do the building inspections.",24,,
159,0.97,1074.039,1075.34,That became very important for us.,24,,
160,0.97,1075.407,1083.949,"You know, one of the pieces of new work that actually wasn't listed was, you know, trying to help the business owners.",24,,
161,0.97,1084.016,1087.753,Mainly the restaurants with the tip compliance issues and things like that.,24,,
162,0.97,1087.82,1090.789,That's not even tied to this.,24,,
163,0.97,1090.856,1097.93,"But the closures played in, mainly to these building inspections.",24,,
164,0.97,1097.996,1098.197,Yeah.,25,,
165,0.97,1098.263,1101.4,And that's the part I'm hoping that you understand a little bit.,25,,
166,0.97,1101.467,1104.703,"I mean, you explain a little bit more.",25,,
167,0.97,1104.77,1118.951,"I'm not quite sure I understand that a business not being open impacts, why that would impact your ability to access that business.",25,,
168,0.97,1119.017,1128.961,"Presumably, you have ways to contact building owners and managers, irrespective of their being open or closed.",25,,
169,0.97,1129.027,1133.398,Because of the emergency nature of your work.,25,,
170,0.97,1133.465,1147.579,But Maybe I'm not understanding the kind of information that you have available to you about the contact of building owners and managers.,25,,
171,0.97,1147.646,1147.913,Sure.,26,,
172,0.97,1147.98,1148.213,Absolutely.,26,,
173,0.97,1148.28,1157.022,"So what our fire companies do, is they call the property owner, the business owner, and they make an appointment, so they can get on site to actually do the physical building inspection.",26,,
174,0.97,1157.089,1159.391,So that's the key to these.,26,,
175,0.97,1159.458,1169.935,"You know, when you're checking compliance for fire life safety systems, exits, electrical, high power storage, all of these different things, it's all about being on site.",26,,
176,0.97,1170.002,1180.012,We have access to the common space in pretty much every building in the city through the knocks box key system.,26,,
177,0.97,1180.078,1184.583,But oftentimes there are businesses within the building that are not tied to the common space.,26,,
178,0.97,1184.65,1190.222,So we may not be able to go just door-to-door.,26,,
179,0.97,1190.289,1199.565,"So this is tied to making an appointment, meeting the property owner, or the business owner on site, and then doing a business inspection or a building information.",26,,
180,0.97,1199.631,1203.001,So that's kind of what it's tied to there.,26,,
181,0.97,1203.068,1207.673,"Thank you, appreciate it.",27,,
182,0.97,1207.739,1208.04,Hydrants.,28,,
183,0.97,1208.106,1210.042,That's another area where we try to focus.,28,,
184,0.97,1210.108,1213.111,That's one of the main tools we use in fighting fire.,28,,
185,0.97,1213.178,1219.484,We got to 97% completion rate of all of the Hydrants in the city.,28,,
186,0.97,1219.551,1222.888,"Over 16,000, almost 17,000 Hydrants.",28,,
187,0.97,1222.955,1227.225,And the last 3% made tied to maintenance or different things like that.,28,,
188,0.97,1227.292,1232.965,That was really good for us as an organization there.,28,,
189,0.97,1233.031,1240.238,"Then since we did not have as many building inspections, we did a shift, and we started focusing on training.",28,,
190,0.97,1240.305,1256.622,"We've been kind of reshaping our training program over the last few years, and we've become very intentional with maintaining compliance with 296, 305 of the WAC, our policies and guidelines.",28,,
191,0.97,1256.688,1263.795,"So we became very intentional with how we deploy training, whether it's Multi-Company drills.",28,,
192,0.97,1263.862,1273.438,"Whether it's daily assigned training, and actually tracking with our platforms over the last few years, we've become much more efficient in how we track our training hours.",28,,
193,0.97,1273.505,1284.216,"There's a lot more compliance, whether it's Elt, or 0 our driver certification platforms in anything and everything we do.",28,,
194,0.97,1284.282,1288.02,So we really saw an Uptick in that area.,28,,
195,0.97,1288.086,1294.326,"Firefighters were really staying busy, making sure we were ready to go if the emergency came.",28,,
196,0.97,1294.393,1304.569,"And to highlight some of the items we focused on this year nd in 2021, and this is a busy slide, so I'll kind of walk through it.",28,,
197,0.97,1304.636,1329.294,"But behind this slide, we have 8 to 12 different committees, projects or programs that are also working through their own work plans for the Department, but these are the ones that I'll lift up for the conversation today, are In-Web transition team has been working hard to transition the Seattle fire Department to the In-Web platform.",28,,
198,0.97,1329.361,1331.263,"Many, many hours put into this.",28,,
199,0.97,1331.329,1332.597,And we finally made that transition.,28,,
200,0.97,1332.664,1345.31,"By the end of March, we hope to be complete, working through all of the bugs, but I want to lift up our public affairs team, with our public affairs director who led that work.",28,,
201,0.97,1345.377,1355.02,"Kim and our PIO's, that's really Downloading a Veryold system, and going through the files and Transitioning it into this new In-Web system.",28,,
202,0.97,1355.087,1356.855,We're really happy to have that first step done.,28,,
203,0.97,1356.922,1361.993,"By the end of this month, we hope to be wrapped up with that project.",28,,
204,0.97,1362.06,1362.961,Then our mobile inspection program.,28,,
205,0.97,1363.028,1369.101,We have been trying to get to mobile inspections for a couple years now.,28,,
206,0.97,1369.167,1373.872,And that's similar to our electronic Healthcare reports that we actually now do for patients out in the field.,28,,
207,0.97,1373.939,1380.312,"We want to be able to take a tablet, or a device, go inside of a property.",28,,
208,0.97,1380.378,1385.65,"Actually do a building inspection on a tablet, and then be able to send a report electronically.",28,,
209,0.97,1385.717,1388.62,That creates a number of efficiencies.,28,,
210,0.97,1388.687,1398.697,"Once the work is done and the tablet is now Uploaded into the systems, if the property or business owner is on the site, we can send him a copy of the report immediately.",28,,
211,0.97,1398.764,1404.202,"So this is going to be another technology advancement for the democratic, and it should create efficiencies.",28,,
212,0.97,1404.269,1409.274,"Because what we do right now is we go out in the field, we create a business inspection.",28,,
213,0.97,1409.341,1410.842,We write a sheet of paper down.,28,,
214,0.97,1410.909,1417.949,"We go back to the station, we input that into our computer system, and then we'll put a notice of violation in the mail.",28,,
215,0.97,1418.016,1423.622,So we should be able to close that loop and streamline that a bit more.,28,,
216,0.97,1423.688,1428.894,So that's going to be a really big one for us.,28,,
217,0.97,1428.96,1432.798,"The deployment of help 2, and help 3. we've been really working on that.",28,,
218,0.97,1432.864,1443.241,"There's a number of pieces to this, so we've been working on the staffing platform with selecting the two firefighters.",28,,
219,0.97,1443.308,1447.779,"We recently had the interviews, so we started Whittling that down.",28,,
220,0.97,1447.846,1449.881,Purchasing a new vehicle.,28,,
221,0.97,1449.948,1450.782,The logistics of the facility.,28,,
222,0.97,1450.849,1465.797,"It will be on at fire station 2 in 2 in Belltown, so getting a facility ready to go, and all the equipment, and training, so our target there is just after the beginning of April.",28,,
223,0.97,1465.864,1467.432,We hope to have help 2 on the street.,28,,
224,0.97,1467.499,1469.167,So that will be pretty important for us.,28,,
225,0.97,1469.234,1474.84,"We saw the value of it a couple of weekends ago, during the recent snowstorm.",28,,
226,0.97,1474.906,1481.68,"We were able to put a help 2 unit on the street, along with help 1, on the second night of the snowstorm.",28,,
227,0.97,1481.746,1487.519,"During that, there was enough work for everyone to do, and the firefighters really did a great job there.",28,,
228,0.97,1487.586,1493.658,"The next project that we're working through is our work scheduling, and time Quiching program.",28,,
229,0.97,1493.725,1499.731,"So that will be our electronic hiring, and staffing program.",28,,
230,0.97,1499.798,1502.334,It will integrate with the city's payroll system.,28,,
231,0.97,1502.4,1514.446,"It will eliminate the use of our paper overtime sheets, and all the paperwork that go behind that, and it will be a live system that's all electronic.",28,,
232,0.97,1514.512,1518.116,So we're really looking forward to moving that forward this year.,28,,
233,0.97,1518.183,1522.888,Probably about the first of May hopefully we're wrapped up with that.,28,,
234,0.97,1522.954,1526.057,We'll start the launch at the end of March.,28,,
235,0.97,1526.124,1530.996,"The training is already built, and we're in the final stages of the user acceptance system.",28,,
236,0.97,1531.062,1536.101,So we're really looking forward to getting that going there also.,28,,
237,0.97,1536.167,1543.441,"I'm covering a lot, so I'll pause and see if there's any questions at this point.",28,,
238,0.97,1543.508,1544.142,Thank you.,29,,
239,0.97,1544.209,1546.278,I see Councilmember Lewis has his hands up.,29,,
240,0.97,1546.344,1555.22,"Thank you so much for that update on the health one expansion, to health two and three.",30,,
241,0.97,1555.287,1559.457,I just want to ask a few follow up questions while that's fresh in my mind.,30,,
242,0.97,1559.524,1578.043,"First off, I want to appreciate the indulgence of the Department in letting me ride along on the snow day last Saturday, that you just acknowledged that the team was out there, can personally attest to their professionalism, diligence and the difference they made on that day.",30,,
243,0.97,1578.109,1589.287,"It was really good to see, and I was very impressed by that service and the standard the fire Department is setting for low Acuity response.",30,,
244,0.97,1589.354,1595.961,"So to get that recognition out of the way, and specifically give some props to firefighter Weber and firefighter young for their service.",30,,
245,0.97,1596.027,1599.23,It was really good to see them in action.,30,,
246,0.97,1599.297,1603.068,Moving on to talk about expanding that service.,30,,
247,0.97,1603.134,1605.704,I just have a few follow up questions.,30,,
248,0.97,1605.77,1620.618,"So when you say health 2 is going to be stationed in fire station 2 in Belltown, were you saying that health 2 and health 3 are going to both be there, or just health 2 is going to be staged out of that location?",30,,
249,0.97,1620.685,1624.189,Just health 2 is going object out of that location.,31,,
250,0.97,1624.255,1627.892,So health 1 is here in Pioneer square.,31,,
251,0.97,1627.959,1635.3,"Health 2 will be in Belltown, but their budget, their circular area of expansion will be much larger.",31,,
252,0.97,1635.367,1636.735,Health 3 will be in the North.,31,,
253,0.97,1636.801,1645.51,"The plan is, that will be north of the cut, whether it's in the U district or if we have room at the new temporary fire station 31.",31,,
254,0.97,1645.577,1651.683,That's the target area for help 3. these three units will work together.,31,,
255,0.97,1651.75,1658.99,"We know there's a great need over in the U district, and over in 31S district over in the Northgate area.",31,,
256,0.97,1659.057,1662.427,"Just a few follow up questions on that, chief.",32,,
257,0.97,1662.494,1682.547,"What do you anticipate to be the service bubble from the health 2 deployment in Belltown, just as the District 7 particularly interested in that, since it's squarely in district 7, would be curious what the plan is, for the service area of that vehicle.",32,,
258,0.97,1682.614,1682.914,Absolutely.,33,,
259,0.97,1682.981,1687.952,So health 1 is covering that service area today.,33,,
260,0.97,1688.019,1689.154,Heath 2 will help expand that.,33,,
261,0.97,1689.22,1703.668,"But what we hope when we launch health 2 is, we'll also be able to have touch points in Ballard, and in the U district, even when we put health 2 in, we'll have more capacity when we put health 3 in.",33,,
262,0.97,1703.735,1707.338,"But health 1, downtown core.",33,,
263,0.97,1707.405,1709.374,"Health 2, downtown core.",33,,
264,0.97,1709.441,1710.442,"Ballard, U district.",33,,
265,0.97,1710.508,1711.676,Then health 3. they'll keep expanding more.,33,,
266,0.97,1711.743,1714.546,The bubble will continue to get wider in the core of the city.,33,,
267,0.97,1714.612,1715.98,From the core of the city out.,33,,
268,0.97,1716.047,1721.052,"Just to follow up on that, chief Scoggins.",34,,
269,0.97,1721.119,1721.719,I appreciate the clarification.,34,,
270,0.97,1721.786,1731.229,Would health 2's service area then sort of include all points between the U district and Ballard touch points?,34,,
271,0.97,1731.296,1751.85,"I think particularly about Interbay, where we do have a high concentrations particularly along Commodore way where a health 2 response would probably be helpful, particularly for the folks living Unhoused in that corridor.",34,,
272,0.97,1751.916,1753.585,Would that be included?,34,,
273,0.97,1753.651,1757.655,"Or would it be the health down area, and Ballard?",34,,
274,0.97,1757.722,1764.596,"Would they bypass points in between, or would the inner Bay area be included in the anticipated health 2 service area?",34,,
275,0.97,1764.662,1766.364,It would be included.,35,,
276,0.97,1766.431,1767.765,We're not going to bypass areas.,35,,
277,0.97,1767.832,1769.834,We're going to go to where the need is.,35,,
278,0.97,1769.901,1773.738,"So our firefighters in the community, they're calling us to those locations today.",35,,
279,0.97,1773.805,1781.679,"Actually, I guess I should have added, one of those coverage maps of our fire set platform, of where it's actually going.",35,,
280,0.97,1781.746,1785.75,Health 1 is actually having touch points in Interbay today.,35,,
281,0.97,1785.817,1786.851,In these different areas today.,35,,
282,0.97,1786.918,1787.652,But it's only one unit.,35,,
283,0.97,1787.719,1790.588,So they're going to all these areas right now.,35,,
284,0.97,1790.655,1794.392,Health 2 will give us more capacity.,35,,
285,0.97,1794.459,1798.83,"So we won't bypass an area, but we are expanding the bubble.",35,,
286,0.97,1798.897,1811.342,"Maybe I'll send you a map, if that's okay of the different locations, that health 1 actually is visiting today, and that will kind of give you a sense of how this expansion will help.",35,,
287,0.97,1811.409,1812.577,It's mainly with capacity.,35,,
288,0.97,1812.644,1813.945,I appreciate that.,36,,
289,0.97,1814.012,1820.852,"I have one last question, then I'll close out this inquiry on the health 1 expansion.",36,,
290,0.97,1820.919,1854.018,"So you know, from doing, I've done a couple ride Alongs now with health 1. one thing I've noticed, and this would be something I'd like to maybe see the Department, if it's deemed appropriate, to maybe incorporate into something to include in the annual report, you know, post 2021 of looking at the health 1 program, is Maybe an assessment insofar as you can tell of the back end assets, that health one has access to.",36,,
291,0.97,1854.085,1866.698,I know this has been the case with Councilmember Mosqueda on her ride along.,36,,
292,0.97,1866.764,1874.706,"They'll be able to give some assistance, socks, bottled water, what have you, maybe provide some on-site first aid.",36,,
293,0.97,1874.772,1894.292,"But then when it comes time to transport to direct transport to a provider, get in touch with a case manager, get in touch with some kind of service that is 24 hour, rather than like a 9 to 5, I'd be interested in an analysis, maybe from the Department that looks at those back end resources.",36,,
294,0.97,1894.359,1901.699,"Because I think that what we often could as a Council and policymakers is, you know, we spend a lot of time on the first response.",36,,
295,0.97,1901.766,1904.369,This applies to what we're doing with the police Department too.,36,,
296,0.97,1904.435,1914.679,"We spent a lot of time on, you know, who is the Responder for the point in time to respond to this issue where 911 has been called, or help has been summoned?",36,,
297,0.97,1914.746,1926.524,"I think that we need to be evaluating more, tracking data more on the back end hookups that come on the other side of that response, where I think that there is much greater need.",36,,
298,0.97,1926.591,1936.634,"It seems like health 1 could Churn through a lot more cases, and clear costs faster, if there were easier Handoffs to providers.",36,,
299,0.97,1936.701,1952.817,"Easier warm Handoffs to resources, and that the health 1 benefit could be made more 24/7, rather than 9 to 5, if there were commensurate services that were open on a more dependable base on the 24/7 basis.",36,,
300,0.97,1952.884,1971.502,"So this is an earlier in the year flagging for me, that I think would be really useful information to have in a 2021 annual report, where it's like, here's all the great work, health 1 has been doing, and here's some of the hurdles we're running into, in terms of those back end assets.",36,,
301,0.97,1971.569,1973.304,"Sure, we'll put that together for you.",37,,
302,0.97,1973.371,1977.942,That's one of the reasons we targeted the Timeline.,37,,
303,0.97,1978.009,1984.282,The resources available for the Handoffs are pretty much 9 to 5 resources.,37,,
304,0.97,1984.349,1986.784,That's why we targeted the window that we targeted.,37,,
305,0.97,1986.851,2002.233,"But we have the list we have now, we actually have our first four quarter report, because it went into service in November of '█19 and we wrapped that up with a one year report of its first year in service.",37,,
306,0.97,2002.3,2006.704,So it will actually highlight a number of those resources that are available.,37,,
307,0.97,2006.771,2014.479,"But we'll also pay attention to the gaps, and maybe add some of that in there also.",37,,
308,0.97,2014.545,2016.08,"Thank you, chief.",38,,
309,0.97,2016.147,2021.152,Just one other question about the service bubble issue.,38,,
310,0.97,2021.219,2024.455,And I see Councilmember Morales has her hand up as well.,38,,
311,0.97,2024.522,2039.804,"I seem to recall that in our regular briefings, I learned from you that there's a difference between the service bubble and the concept of you going where you're needed.",38,,
312,0.97,2039.871,2042.106,Could you just talk a little bit more about that?,38,,
313,0.97,2042.173,2051.449,I seem to recall that you had said that health 2 had the capacity to go anywhere in the city.,38,,
314,0.97,2051.516,2063.294,"Although there was a service bubble that recognized both the location where you're being deployed from, and where the needs were.",38,,
315,0.97,2063.361,2079.877,"But Maybe I'm remembering that incorrectly, but I do remember being told that, or I remember hearing that health 2 did have the capacity to go anywhere in the city was not limited to the service bubble.",38,,
316,0.97,2079.944,2080.144,Right.,39,,
317,0.97,2080.211,2082.046,And that is correct.,39,,
318,0.97,2082.113,2083.848,That's the same for health 1.,39,,
319,0.97,2083.915,2087.752,Our focus area is the downtown core.,39,,
320,0.97,2087.819,2096.36,"As we expand the area with health 2, our bubble is expanding to include, you know, the youth district and Ballard, and areas like that.",39,,
321,0.97,2096.427,2106.037,"But if there's a need that the firefighters are having in another part of the city, and that generally happens on more of a Oneoff type situation.",39,,
322,0.97,2106.103,2114.312,"Then in health 1 and the case manager is the best resource to help the person, then health 1 has gone outside of the service bubble.",39,,
323,0.97,2114.378,2117.515,So they have gone in different places around the city.,39,,
324,0.97,2117.582,2120.785,That's what the map will show.,39,,
325,0.97,2120.852,2128.025,"But our focus area is the core, because that's where most of the need is.",39,,
326,0.97,2128.092,2128.493,"Thank you, chief.",40,,
327,0.97,2128.559,2130.194,Councilmember Morales.,40,,
328,0.97,2130.261,2131.095,Thank you.,41,,
329,0.97,2131.162,2140.404,"Thank you very much for this, chief chief Scoggins.",41,,
330,0.97,2140.471,2147.144,"You've addressed my first question, which is can we get a map of where these service areas are?",41,,
331,0.97,2147.211,2164.128,"I certainly understand that there is a huge need downtown, but I also know that we're having lots of issues in Sodo, in Georgetown under the Jose Roso bridge.",41,,
332,0.97,2164.195,2175.339,"I would be interested to see if that increases the capacity to move health 2 a little South, and so I'll look forward to seeing the map, and having that conversation with you.",41,,
333,0.97,2175.406,2191.656,"Then I also just want to echo Councilmember Lewis's concern about making sure that we have a clear understanding of what the 24/7, you know, or 24 hour service providers are.",41,,
334,0.97,2191.722,2192.823,Who are out there.,41,,
335,0.97,2192.89,2209.173,"What is available, so that we can really make sure that you know, if something is happening in the middle of the night, that there isn't a delay in trying to get a Handoff to services or to, you know, more permanent housing situation for folks.",41,,
336,0.97,2209.24,2215.246,"So I look forward to talking with you about that, and working on that as well.",41,,
337,0.97,2215.313,2215.846,Absolutely.,42,,
338,0.97,2215.913,2217.114,We'll put that list together.,42,,
339,0.97,2217.181,2231.929,"It's like I mentioned earlier, the reason why we put it in service the times that it's in service is because that's when most of the providers that we can do a warm Handoff with are actually open.",42,,
340,0.97,2231.996,2239.637,"But we'll put that list together, and we'll make sure that we get that back to you there.",42,,
341,0.97,2239.704,2241.138,Moving onto our training division restructuring.,42,,
342,0.97,2241.205,2259.223,"So that's another area where we've been working to try to create more efficiencies in how we do training, as a Seattle fire Department, and funding full time FTE's to really focus on what we're doing as an organization.",42,,
343,0.97,2259.29,2274.538,"A way we were doing in this the past, and this year while we were going through the transition is we would bring in people to teach different training programs, and next year we would bring in a different person to teach the same training program, because we didn't have a funded position to do it.",42,,
344,0.97,2274.605,2277.475,So it created the lack of consistency.,42,,
345,0.97,2277.541,2293.424,"So now what we're driving towards is expanding our training division staff, down at our joint training facility on Meyers way to create more consistency in our platforms in how we do training as an organization.",42,,
346,0.97,2293.491,2296.761,So that's another big area that we're moving towards this year.,42,,
347,0.97,2296.827,2299.497,"The next one, our driver certification program.",42,,
348,0.97,2299.563,2308.205,"Many of you may remember through our contract negotiations with local 27, we formalized a plan to create a certified driver's training program.",42,,
349,0.97,2308.272,2318.516,"And that's what our team has really been working towards under the leadership of deputy chief Melissa Kennedy, in our training division, and the project lead, Captain Batastelli.",42,,
350,0.97,2318.582,2322.62,"Over the last year, the team has done an incredible amount of work.",42,,
351,0.97,2322.687,2342.139,"By this summer, all of our seated drivers will actually have gone through the Certificatefication process to actually have taken the task of wine a manipulative test to actually be a certified driver in the Seattle fire Department, and now we continue to move towards getting all of our relief drivers trained.",42,,
352,0.97,2342.206,2350.114,"So by the end of this year, our goal is to have all of our seated drivers, and all of our relief drivers in a certified capacity.",42,,
353,0.97,2350.181,2358.422,"From that point forward, any new driver who drives any of our engines of our Ladders will actually have gone through a certification process.",42,,
354,0.97,2358.489,2363.561,"So for us, that's going to be pretty important for us.",42,,
355,0.97,2363.627,2373.27,"The next topic, unless there's a question, is our continuing education motto, and our fire alarm center.",42,,
356,0.97,2373.337,2375.406,A 911 fire dispatch center.,42,,
357,0.97,2375.473,2379.31,So our Dispatchers have so many different Certifications they have to keep up on.,42,,
358,0.97,2379.376,2385.316,"So every now and again, we need to hit the refresh button, and make sure that we're still moving in the right direction.",42,,
359,0.97,2385.382,2414.578,"A couple years ago, we deployed a new emergency medical dispatch protocol system, so now is the time to evaluate our training model to make sure it is in alignment there, as we also have new programs coming on, to make sure our Dispatchers are well trained, and given the amount of training they need to be efficient in delivering those 911 calls to our firefighters.",42,,
360,0.97,2414.645,2415.079,2021 recruit training.,42,,
361,0.97,2415.146,2421.552,"So on February 3RD, I believe it was, we started a new recruit class so they're in training right now.",42,,
362,0.97,2421.619,2428.959,"Middle, toward the end of May, so it's a 15.5 week training program.",42,,
363,0.97,2429.026,2443.44,"It's a very rigorous firefighter recruit training program, and we'll see how many come out of the other end, and we'll start a second class, and thank you for supporting our second class, that we'll start in August.",42,,
364,0.97,2443.507,2446.243,So our goal is to hire 60 new firefighters this year.,42,,
365,0.97,2446.31,2451.749,And that's really going to help us as an organization.,42,,
366,0.97,2451.816,2455.619,Last year what we saw is 57 retirements.,42,,
367,0.97,2455.686,2456.153,Just pure retirements.,42,,
368,0.97,2456.22,2460.424,We also have had other people that leave the Organization for a variety of reasons.,42,,
369,0.97,2460.491,2463.794,But the 57 retirements was a pretty high number for us.,42,,
370,0.97,2463.861,2466.864,We've been Hoveringbetween 40 and 60 vacancies.,42,,
371,0.97,2466.931,2469.433,So this will help us start to Witle that number down.,42,,
372,0.97,2469.5,2477.174,"With all the different things that we're doing, having enough firefighters is going to be critical for us.",42,,
373,0.97,2477.241,2478.409,"You know, here's an example.",42,,
374,0.97,2478.475,2482.813,We're staffing the four community testing sites right now.,42,,
375,0.97,2482.88,2483.948,So that's staffed with firefighters.,42,,
376,0.97,2484.014,2487.852,Our mobile vaccination teams are staffed with additional firefighters.,42,,
377,0.97,2487.918,2503.0,"Medic 26, and ladder 13 in West Seattle are staffed with additional firefighters, and we haven't had any community events this year, so this staffing really helps us continue to support the city, and on these new, and different ways.",42,,
378,0.97,2503.067,2505.469,Any questions there?,42,,
379,0.97,2505.536,2506.27,"Thank you, chief.",43,,
380,0.97,2506.337,2507.071,Yes.,43,,
381,0.97,2507.137,2515.913,"As it relates to the funding, the Council provided to allow for additional hiring of firefighters.",43,,
382,0.97,2515.98,2527.691,Can you share with my colleagues some of the challenges that you have identified in our meetings around having enough testing slots?,43,,
383,0.97,2527.758,2533.43,I believe that's the challenge that you have identified.,43,,
384,0.97,2533.497,2533.697,Yeah.,44,,
385,0.97,2533.764,2540.871,"So for us to bring a new firefighter on board, it's about $70,000 for each firefighter.",44,,
386,0.97,2540.938,2543.44,So this is a pretty rigorous process.,44,,
387,0.97,2543.507,2557.221,"But our last testing process that we did, we put a new list in play in early 2020, I believe was the last new list.",44,,
388,0.97,2557.288,2564.295,"On that list, we had 4400 people that signed up to become a firefighter.",44,,
389,0.97,2564.361,2569.433,"At the end of that process, we had about 2500 people on the list.",44,,
390,0.97,2569.5,2583.113,"So right now we've hired two classes off of that list, and we're already in the 3 or 400 name range of that 1200 person he list.",44,,
391,0.97,2583.18,2584.081,We haven't Highered 1200 people.,44,,
392,0.97,2584.148,2586.517,But we're already to that 3 or 400 number.,44,,
393,0.97,2586.583,2590.554,There's a number of steps you have to take to get there.,44,,
394,0.97,2590.621,2594.725,You have to pass the physical test.,44,,
395,0.97,2594.792,2597.795,Which can be Difficultfor some people.,44,,
396,0.97,2597.861,2598.662,"A medical, a psychological background.",44,,
397,0.97,2598.729,2600.831,All of those will get you to recruit training.,44,,
398,0.97,2600.898,2606.57,"Then when you get to recruit training, we generally lose a number of recruits in recruit training.",44,,
399,0.97,2606.637,2627.424,"So 1200 people sounds like a lot of people but oftentimes, a person may not fully understand the job they're getting into, unwilling they wrap up all the gear, put the mask on, and then we say it's time to go to work.",44,,
400,0.97,2627.491,2629.193,Now you're dressed for work.,44,,
401,0.97,2629.259,2632.73,Now you have to go to work for a few hours.,44,,
402,0.97,2632.796,2637.501,"Our challenge is, 1200 names may not be enough names.",44,,
403,0.97,2637.568,2654.685,"So trying to turn the testing world a little bet faster, is really going to be important for us in the coming years, just to make sure that we continue to refresh that list, and have promote names to continue the hiring process.",44,,
404,0.97,2654.752,2683.48,"So chief, own though there's sufficient funding for hiring a greater number of firefighters than the 20 firefighters that you originally had been budgeted for, this testing barrier creates a backlog, and it means, as I understand it, that you may not be able to meet the goal for an additional 40 hires.",45,,
405,0.97,2683.547,2685.916,So it's two parts.,46,,
406,0.97,2685.983,2691.755,"So we partner with public safety civil service on the front side, on the written, and the oral interview side.",46,,
407,0.97,2691.822,2695.459,Then we take it once we get a certified list from public safety.,46,,
408,0.97,2695.526,2712.076,"So the front side is the peace that we're working with public safety service, and Sdhr to try to make sure we can turn that wheel fast enough, so we can have a refresh at some point in time, so we don't run out of names on the list.",46,,
409,0.97,2712.142,2719.316,Because about 25 to 28% of the Department right now are retirement eligible.,46,,
410,0.97,2719.383,2728.792,"So we know most firefighters don't leave at 53, but somewhere between 53 and 60, they'll probably be leaving.",46,,
411,0.97,2728.859,2731.361,So that's a large portion of the organization.,46,,
412,0.97,2731.428,2736.9,That's why we're really trying to keep up with the hiring process.,46,,
413,0.97,2736.967,2737.501,"Thank you, chief.",47,,
414,0.97,2737.568,2745.075,Moving onto the next item is implementing our consulting nurse program.,48,,
415,0.97,2745.142,2750.981,"That's actually adding in a consulting nurse to our dispatch center, to our dispatch process.",48,,
416,0.97,2751.048,2752.716,We think this is a really important addition.,48,,
417,0.97,2752.783,2770.0,"What we've done to date is we talked to 911 dispatch centers from Copenhagen to Washington, D.C. to, I think I have a call later with Dedale Decalb, Georgia.",48,,
418,0.97,2770.067,2780.644,"The reason why this is important, of those 80,000 responses that I showed you earlier on a slide, about 60,000 of those responses were EMS related.",48,,
419,0.97,2780.711,2785.716,"Our medics respond to about 12 to 15,000 of those.",48,,
420,0.97,2785.782,2792.256,"Then our firefighters respond on the other side, because there would be less calls.",48,,
421,0.97,2792.322,2793.857,"Emr will transport 5 to 7,000.",48,,
422,0.97,2793.924,2803.7,"But that means there's probably 10 to 20,000 EMS responses we actually respond to every year, and we leave them where they are for one reason or another.",48,,
423,0.97,2803.767,2807.604,It may be it's not an acute life-threatening emergency.,48,,
424,0.97,2807.671,2826.924,"Maybe they don't need a transport, or maybe we need to have a shift in our 911 protocols, and we could actually connect them up to a nurse, or a nurse could actually take longer to have a more in-depth Coronavirus about their real needs, and redirect them to where they need to be.",48,,
425,0.97,2826.99,2830.027,That's what agencies are doing around the country.,48,,
426,0.97,2830.093,2835.632,That's a piece that we're really looking forward to adding this member to our team.,48,,
427,0.97,2835.699,2837.701,So we have case managers on site now.,48,,
428,0.97,2837.768,2840.137,We have our health 1 program on site.,48,,
429,0.97,2840.204,2844.741,So we're doing a lot of things to really try to redirect people to where they need to be.,48,,
430,0.97,2844.808,2855.485,We think this is going to be a critical component to our dispatch center in the future.,48,,
431,0.97,2855.552,2857.387,Any questions there?,48,,
432,0.97,2857.454,2859.489,Not seeing any.,49,,
433,0.97,2859.556,2862.059,Madam chair?,50,,
434,0.97,2862.125,2864.828,"Wait, Councilmember Lewis.",51,,
435,0.97,2864.895,2867.764,Thanks for this update chief Scoggins.,52,,
436,0.97,2867.831,2872.936,I'm very excited about this particular function with the dispatch nurse.,52,,
437,0.97,2873.003,2876.44,What's the Timeline on getting that going?,52,,
438,0.97,2876.506,2883.614,"Like I'd heard before that there might be contracting with a provider, or someone might be hired to come in house.",52,,
439,0.97,2883.68,2886.984,What's the way the Department is looking to implement that right now?,52,,
440,0.97,2887.05,2903.533,"You know in the next month or so, we hope to land the plane on whether it's best to contract for the service so our Dispatchers would transfer the call, or to have the person In- house.",53,,
441,0.97,2903.6,2907.07,"If we hire the person in-house, that can come in a couple of ways.",53,,
442,0.97,2907.137,2915.912,"If we hired a nurse to be dispatched that's one way, or we can contract with a partner to actually staff a nurse in our dispatch center.",53,,
443,0.97,2915.979,2925.489,"So in our next month or so, we should be able to land that plane, but our target for having this position on board is around the beginning of September.",53,,
444,0.97,2925.555,2937.668,"That's the target that we're shooting for right now, and like I said, our emergency medical dispatch protocol system is called Cordi.",53,,
445,0.97,2937.734,2942.506,That system comes out of Copenhagen.,53,,
446,0.97,2942.572,2950.48,"So in Copenhagen, they have already deployed this type of system.",53,,
447,0.97,2950.547,2955.485,"So many of the calls go to the nurse in that system, because Úit's much more mature than our system.",53,,
448,0.97,2955.552,2961.625,So we've really been talking to them a lot.,53,,
449,0.97,2961.692,2968.298,"We've also talked to other providers around the country, to try to figure out what would work best for Seattle.",53,,
450,0.97,2968.365,2972.002,September is our window that we're targeting there.,53,,
451,0.97,2972.069,2979.609,"Chief, what's the name of that system again?",54,,
452,0.97,2979.676,2981.278,Corti.,55,,
453,0.97,2981.345,2983.547,How is that spelled?,56,,
454,0.97,2983.613,2983.847,Corti.,57,,
455,0.97,2983.914,2984.314,Very exciting stuff.,57,,
456,0.97,2984.381,2985.315,Appreciate the update.,57,,
457,0.97,2985.382,2988.118,Thank you very much.,57,,
458,0.97,2988.185,2989.453,Absolutely.,58,,
459,0.97,2989.519,2992.122,The next item is our 2021-2022 recruitment plan.,58,,
460,0.97,2992.189,3006.67,"So as we start to ramp up to our next recruitment and hiring process, we'll get our team together, and we'll start to put our plan on how we actually will do Recruitmen in this next process.",58,,
461,0.97,3006.737,3008.138,So we're really excited about that.,58,,
462,0.97,3008.205,3021.785,"I know our King County fire Chiefs, we commissioned a study with a company called plug research, and we look at the diversity, equity, and inclusion in all of the King County fire departments.",58,,
463,0.97,3021.852,3030.494,"We reached out to a number of fire departments around the country, and we really assembled a report with best practices in it.",58,,
464,0.97,3030.56,3032.262,So our team will start to go through that.,58,,
465,0.97,3032.329,3041.138,It will be a really good tool that we can use to help increase our diversity in the Seattle fire Department.,58,,
466,0.97,3041.204,3041.438,Let's see.,58,,
467,0.97,3041.505,3056.52,"We touched a little bit on health 2. we touched on health 3. but our target for health 3 is the fourth quarter of 2021, so we're really going to be moving forward down that road there.",58,,
468,0.97,3056.586,3057.754,So we're really excited about it.,58,,
469,0.97,3057.821,3063.627,It's really working out well for the organization.,58,,
470,0.97,3063.693,3067.464,"2021 recruit training, hiring 20 additional firefighters in August.",58,,
471,0.97,3067.531,3070.133,That would give us our full complement of 60.,58,,
472,0.97,3070.2,3080.811,"So if we lose some in this February class, you know, that number 20 for August may grow To22, or 23 to try to get as close to 60 as possible.",58,,
473,0.97,3080.877,3089.419,Then the last item on the work plan is our peace turn implementation.,58,,
474,0.97,3089.486,3096.226,"So this project has been moving along for you know, seven our eight years now.",58,,
475,0.97,3096.293,3103.3,It's a $281 million project of replacing all the radio infrastructure around King County.,58,,
476,0.97,3103.366,3112.843,We're going from approximately 27 towers to 60 towers throughout the region.,58,,
477,0.97,3112.909,3114.978,Replacing all of the radios.,58,,
478,0.97,3115.045,3123.887,"17,000, 18,000 mobile radios, dispatch Council, and all of those.",58,,
479,0.97,3123.954,3128.291,The big piece tore 2021 is we hope to start dispatching the mobile radios.,58,,
480,0.97,3128.358,3134.664,"You can imagine it's quite a project to transition 17 to 18,000 mobile and portable radios.",58,,
481,0.97,3134.731,3136.566,The hand radios are pretty easy.,58,,
482,0.97,3136.633,3137.634,It's just a Handoff.,58,,
483,0.97,3137.701,3150.313,"But the mobile radios, you actually have to change out the infrastructure inside of the fire engines, the ladder trucks, all the response vehicles, not just for Seattle, but throughout the entire country.",58,,
484,0.97,3150.38,3153.283,So it's a pretty significant project.,58,,
485,0.97,3153.35,3161.525,"But it's moving along at a steady pace, but that's going to be a big one for us come the end of the year.",58,,
486,0.97,3161.591,3162.225,Any questions there?,58,,
487,0.97,3162.292,3162.626,"Yes, chief.",59,,
488,0.97,3162.692,3169.399,"One question on concern, and then a couple questions about a couple things I'm not seeing on the work plan.",59,,
489,0.97,3169.466,3184.447,"As it Realties to peace urn, do you have sort of a target schedule for this next stage of radio deployment, so that we can kind of track your progress as you go?",59,,
490,0.97,3184.514,3189.452,"Given like you said, there's a lot of work to be done.",59,,
491,0.97,3189.519,3200.73,A lot of deployment of individual radios and Equipments and just would love to have a little bit of a greater understanding of how that is being rolled out.,59,,
492,0.97,3200.797,3279.743,"Then as it relates to a couple of Wellness-Related items, I would love an update on work for 2021 for fire station 31, and then one of the items that the Council funded as part of the budget deliberation sheer was again another wellness related item, and specifically looking to provide funding for a crisis counselor to help keep firefighters safe and increase positive interactions with folks in crisis or suffering with mental illness, so both wellness for firefighters and training to help them in their interactions with members of the public that have challenges that can also create some trauma in the firefighters that are working to help them.",59,,
493,0.97,3279.809,3280.01,Sure.,60,,
494,0.97,3280.076,3282.178,"So on the first one, peace urn.",60,,
495,0.97,3282.245,3285.649,So we're finalizing the plans probably in the next month or two.,60,,
496,0.97,3285.715,3287.951,We have another joint board meeting this week.,60,,
497,0.97,3288.018,3288.652,We have them monthly.,60,,
498,0.97,3288.718,3302.932,"Then the next month or so, the radio transition plan should start to, the ink should start to dry, along with the coverage task seen on a few other things we have to start.",60,,
499,0.97,3302.999,3307.871,"As those come forward, I'll make sure I add those to our monthly updates.",60,,
500,0.97,3307.937,3309.539,So you'll have those.,60,,
501,0.97,3309.606,3311.975,So that will be coming.,60,,
502,0.97,3312.042,3312.375,Fire station 31.,60,,
503,0.97,3312.442,3322.252,"So temporary fire station 31, we should be starting the process of moving into temporary fire station 31 at the end of Q2, early Q3.",60,,
504,0.97,3322.318,3329.826,"So end of June, early July, we should start the process of Transitioning into the temporary facility on Northgate.",60,,
505,0.97,3329.893,3334.264,So it's across from the old fire station 31 at the church.,60,,
506,0.97,3334.33,3339.069,"So that's going well right now, just to hit the refresh button.",60,,
507,0.97,3339.135,3344.04,We have giants kind of spread out.,60,,
508,0.97,3344.107,3349.345,Engine 31 is at station 17 in the U district.,60,,
509,0.97,3349.412,3352.649,Ladder 35 is in Lake city.,60,,
510,0.97,3352.716,3356.152,And 31 is at station 24.,60,,
511,0.97,3356.219,3357.887,Then medic 31 is at station 35.,60,,
512,0.97,3357.954,3363.093,"So they're all spread out, we want to get those units back home.",60,,
513,0.97,3363.159,3363.593,That's going well.,60,,
514,0.97,3363.66,3365.462,We're looking forward there.,60,,
515,0.97,3365.528,3371.634,"Then on the crisis counselor position, we're working to kind of see what the final outcome of that is going to be right now.",60,,
516,0.97,3371.701,3390.42,"I know there's some work going on behind the scenes on how is it is going to work with local 37 and the fire Department, so I'm working to see the outcome on that, before I can find the Timeline on what exactly it is we're going to do there.",60,,
517,0.97,3390.487,3390.887,Very good.,61,,
518,0.97,3390.954,3391.187,Thank you.,61,,
519,0.97,3391.254,3394.224,Are there any other questions there?,62,,
520,0.97,3394.29,3396.993,I am not seeing any raised hands.,63,,
521,0.97,3397.06,3405.235,So my last slide as our cover briefly is our work on Covid-19 testing and Vaccinations.,64,,
522,0.97,3405.301,3412.408,"Just to hit the refresh button on June 5th, we started with our testing, Communitywide testing, understood we had the four test sides going.",64,,
523,0.97,3412.475,3418.982,The picture on the left is one of the emission centers.,64,,
524,0.97,3419.048,3436.065,"As of yesterday, we tested over 638,000 people at our four test sites, so we're really proud of that work and our firefighters, and our registration Techs, we've hired over 100 since June 5th, to help us through this process.",64,,
525,0.97,3436.132,3442.005,We also now have four mobile vaccination teams.,64,,
526,0.97,3442.071,3446.843,"They have Vaccinated over 6100 people, and they're also working through the second doses now.",64,,
527,0.97,3446.91,3449.512,So those teams are really going well.,64,,
528,0.97,3449.579,3457.22,"We've been in over 130 different facilities around the city, and that team continues to do that work there also.",64,,
529,0.97,3457.287,3459.589,So we're really proud of that going on.,64,,
530,0.97,3459.656,3465.295,And I don't see that stopping until we can start to come out of the pandemic.,64,,
531,0.97,3465.361,3471.501,"But really proud of the work that the firefighters are doing in these areas, and all the other areas that I mentioned.",64,,
532,0.97,3471.568,3478.041,I'll see if there's any questions there.,64,,
533,0.97,3478.107,3481.544,Councilmember Morales.,65,,
534,0.97,3481.611,3487.217,Can you talk a little bit more about the mobile units.,66,,
535,0.97,3487.283,3491.955,"How sites are selected, and kind of who you partner with?",66,,
536,0.97,3492.021,3498.628,I'm particularly interested in this in the context of making sure that we are reaching out in an equitable way.,66,,
537,0.97,3498.695,3519.282,"I know we've had lots of conversation as a council about how to make sure that those who don't have access to technology, don't speak English, necessarily, can be put sort of at the front of the line of getting access to the vaccine.",66,,
538,0.97,3519.349,3519.883,That's one question.,66,,
539,0.97,3519.949,3528.024,"And then how do you anticipate, or do you anticipate having more units or kind of Scaling up, as more vaccine becomes available?",66,,
540,0.97,3528.091,3536.466,"I think I read in the paper this morning, or maybe it was yesterday that King County only has a 2% vaccination rate.",66,,
541,0.97,3536.532,3546.142,"I know that's because of supply, but really wanting to hear more about what our plans are, for Scaling up as more vaccine becomes available.",66,,
542,0.97,3546.209,3548.578,"Sure, so two parts to that question.",67,,
543,0.97,3548.645,3553.049,"Who we partner with, and then Scaling up.",67,,
544,0.97,3553.116,3563.293,"So who we partner with, we're working with Seattle/King County public health, and we're working in the vaccination in the phase available now.",67,,
545,0.97,3563.359,3568.665,And we're working with dawn and all the others to identify those populations that you just touched on.,67,,
546,0.97,3568.731,3580.743,I believe that close to 70% of our population that we have Vaccinated is a part of the Bipop community.,67,,
547,0.97,3580.81,3582.645,That work will continue.,67,,
548,0.97,3582.712,3586.582,"With those community partners, in helping us, connect with those populations.",67,,
549,0.97,3586.649,3605.868,"One of the reasons we're going directly to where people are is because sometimes if you're in a congregate living situation, or you're an adult family home, or senior housing, you may not have a way to get to one of niece vaccination locations.",67,,
550,0.97,3605.935,3609.839,So that's why we're actually taking the Vaccinations out to people.,67,,
551,0.97,3609.906,3614.577,That work will continue by our mobile vaccination teams.,67,,
552,0.97,3614.644,3620.616,"It's been going probably almost seven days a week, since January 14th.",67,,
553,0.97,3620.683,3628.992,"We gave them four wheel drives in the snow, and when we showed up in the snow, I think each team had five locations.",67,,
554,0.97,3629.058,3631.06,The people were surprised they showed up in the snow.,67,,
555,0.97,3631.127,3634.831,That's where we're going to meet the need of that community there.,67,,
556,0.97,3634.897,3644.04,"Scaling up, we're a part of the planning for all of the city's plans to actually scale up in really large ways, so we're looking forward to that.",67,,
557,0.97,3644.107,3651.347,"It's like you mentioned, it's going to be dependent on supply.",67,,
558,0.97,3651.414,3657.02,"Even in our pop UPS, I was watching a few weeks back as we did the one for the grocery workers.",67,,
559,0.97,3657.086,3664.093,I believe we had six firefighters doing the Vaccinations.,67,,
560,0.97,3664.16,3671.334,Talking to acting captain Wallace.,67,,
561,0.97,3671.401,3674.103,We could turn probably 100 people through an hour.,67,,
562,0.97,3674.17,3676.239,So we can really scale up as needed.,67,,
563,0.97,3676.305,3677.807,We're training new people all the time.,67,,
564,0.97,3677.874,3682.111,We put the notice out to the Department.,67,,
565,0.97,3682.178,3686.649,"Many firefighters have volunteered to go through the training that we've developed, and many have.",67,,
566,0.97,3686.716,3690.253,So we're preparing to be a part of the solution.,67,,
567,0.97,3690.319,3693.156,That first slide kind of said it all.,67,,
568,0.97,3693.222,3693.556,Here to serve.,67,,
569,0.97,3693.623,3697.093,We're going to do what we need to do to help the community reopen.,67,,
570,0.97,3697.16,3712.375,"Just to add a little bit to what the chief says here, as it relates to the vaccination sites that the fire Department has been running.",68,,
571,0.97,3712.442,3724.153,"When they say they're Partnering with our community based organizations, what that really means is people are going through the community based organizations in order to get appointments.",68,,
572,0.97,3724.22,3744.24,Those are community based organizations that are not relying on their clients to have access to Online appointment setting Apps or access to the Internet.,68,,
573,0.97,3744.307,3746.876,These are clients that these organizations have relationships with.,68,,
574,0.97,3746.943,3752.215,And they're calling them to help them set up appointments with the fire Department.,68,,
575,0.97,3752.281,3772.301,"And the city has put together a really nice weekly dashboard which I can hand out to folks, that shows exactly where they've gone, who they've partnered with at those different locations.",68,,
576,0.97,3772.368,3772.768,And the demographics.,68,,
577,0.97,3772.835,3773.769,The vaccination rates by race.,68,,
578,0.97,3773.836,3790.486,On the second question about being able to scale up once the vaccine has reached a higher access number of doses.,68,,
579,0.97,3790.553,3806.636,"What I'm being told repeatedly, I'm going to repeat it to the public as well, as a way to hold us all accountable, is that the city can stand up a Max vaccination site within 48 hours of getting sufficient vaccine.",68,,
580,0.97,3806.702,3825.521,"So what that means is they've been doing all the work in the background, in order to put that infrastructure on the ground, in both the human infrastructure and the physical infrastructure, just as soon as we have sufficient access to vaccines.",68,,
581,0.97,3825.588,3832.195,Can I make one more comment?,69,,
582,0.97,3832.261,3842.371,I'm really glad that we are putting that infrastructure in place for the mass vaccination sites and capability.,69,,
583,0.97,3842.438,3878.841,"But I think, you know, we've heard from our community members what we're now hearing in the National media about the equity issue, is that the mass vaccination sites aren't going to reach the people that we are talking about in this conversation, so we do need to be thinking more carefully about, if folks are talking about just a phone Hotline, going door-to-door in some communities, so these relationships with the community based organizations that serve those folks are going to be really important to maintain, and to stay connected with.",69,,
584,0.97,3878.908,3931.46,"I think one of the things that the executive is discussing with King County health and the State Department of health is what level of control does the city maintain as it relates to scheduling for the Dispursement of vaccines that we have access to, and I think that because we are so focused on the demographics of where the greatest needs are, and trying to be so intentional, our advocacy has been around allowing the city to maintain control of scheduling of significant numbers of doses.",70,,
585,0.97,3931.527,3951.08,"And when the city is maintaining control, it means that we're doing so in partnership with our Community- based partners, as opposed to it kind of going into, you know, something that's much more bureaucratic and much more difficult for folks to navigate.",70,,
586,0.97,3951.147,3978.941,"And you no, Councilmember Morel he Morales, I think we're going to be proud when more vaccines come in that we actually have ready to go by the city actually being able to receive its own vaccines, and we put everything behind that, from freezers to infrastructure, with Ppe, with director Goins, and FAS.",71,,
587,0.97,3979.008,3994.39,"I think you're going to be proud of the infrastructure that we have ready to go, whenever we can start to receive large numbers of vaccines.",71,,
588,0.97,3994.457,4002.031,Do Councilmembers have any additional questions?,72,,
589,0.97,4002.098,4005.201,I am not seeing any raised hands.,72,,
590,0.97,4005.267,4033.662,"I want to really thank you, chief Scoggins for taking the time out in your busy morning to share with us, not just your successes from 2020, but your plans for 2021, really appreciate and am proud of the work that you, and the Seattle fire Department do keeping Seattleites safe, and increasingly helping to keep us healthy as well.",72,,
591,0.97,4033.729,4043.672,"Thank you so much for that, and I look forward to continuing to working with you throughout the year.",72,,
592,0.97,4043.739,4044.106,Thank you.,73,,
593,0.97,4044.173,4049.412,"All right, moving and the second item on the agenda.",74,,
594,0.97,4049.478,4059.422,Will the clerk please read agenda item too.,74,,
595,0.97,4059.488,4061.791,Council bill 119981.,75,,
596,0.97,4061.857,4078.641,"An ordinance amending which adopted the 2020 budget through the improvement program, changing appropriations to various budgets to control funds.",75,,
597,0.97,4078.707,4079.041,"There's, Alex.",76,,
598,0.97,4079.108,4086.949,A few moments before I hand it over to Greg from central staff.,76,,
599,0.97,4087.016,4092.121,This item was listed on the agenda for the meeting on January 26th.,76,,
600,0.97,4092.188,4097.46,"We ran out of time, so the meeting was held.",76,,
601,0.97,4097.526,4104.4,We held a subsequent time for this item to be scheduled in February.,76,,
602,0.97,4104.467,4130.125,"But we had heard that from the law Department, that they were advising a delay until they had an opportunity to have some conversation about the actions of the Council in the 2021 budget deliberations, and the contents of this bill, the city attorney that it would be good to connect with the monitoring team.",76,,
603,0.97,4130.192,4147.309,"Because the court and the monitoring team have expressed interest in the city's efforts to restructure the budget of the Seattle police Department, the city attorney's office has had an initial meeting with monitor.",76,,
604,0.97,4147.376,4160.155,And the city attorney's office is working on a follow-up memo that will provide a description of past reductions made to the Seattle police Department's budget.,76,,
605,0.97,4160.222,4177.706,"And explaining a description of the draft bill being considered by Council, and including in the memo a description of SPD's staffing and other resource needs.",76,,
606,0.97,4177.773,4180.876,So this is a first briefing.,76,,
607,0.97,4180.943,4188.484,"We will have another meeting following this one, where we are asking the Seattle police Department to present.",76,,
608,0.97,4188.551,4200.329,You can see in the materials that central staff have provided that there is an attachment of the memo from the Seattle police Department to central staff.,76,,
609,0.97,4200.396,4228.791,"We're not going to develop deeply into that memo today, because we have invited SPD to come and present the contents of that memo, although I think it's completely appropriate if you've already reviewed that memo and you have questions that you want to flag for Greg to prep SPD on an advance of our next meeting, that's fine.",76,,
610,0.97,4228.857,4257.62,"And I just want to, again, provide some advance notice to my colleagues that there are items in the police Department's memo to us that I am interested in exploring how we could address some of those needs, particularly the needs around civilian hires and addressing the needs around public disclosure.",76,,
611,0.97,4257.686,4273.502,"I also have an interest in looking to see how we can address the inspector general's most recent recommendations regarding evidence storage, and there are some specific findings around that.",76,,
612,0.97,4273.569,4286.115,Not all of these recommendations related to public disclosure and evidence storage rely on funding s SPD.,76,,
613,0.97,4286.181,4307.202,"There may be a way to direct those dollars and still meet the need, but just wanting to flag for folks that I do believe the police Department's memo to us highlights some things that we do need the time and space to consider in future meetings.",76,,
614,0.97,4307.269,4310.673,"With that, I'll hand it over to Greg.",76,,
615,0.97,4310.739,4312.141,"Good morning, Madam chair.",77,,
616,0.97,4312.207,4313.308,Members of the committee.,77,,
617,0.97,4313.375,4313.976,"Greg Doss, central staff.",77,,
618,0.97,4314.043,4327.022,"Before I get going I'm going to turn it over to my colleague, Aly Pennucci, who will introduce the subject, and give you a little background on the bill.",77,,
619,0.97,4327.089,4328.824,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",78,,
620,0.97,4328.891,4332.995,"Aly Pennucci, Councilmember project central staff.",78,,
621,0.97,4333.062,4349.044,"Before you today, Councilmember bill 918991, as chair Herbold described it would cut $5 million from SPD's budget, and as introduced would direct those funds to finance general to be used for the Participatory process.",78,,
622,0.97,4349.111,4362.124,You will recall this was introduced in December when the Council was considering the fourth quarter supplemental bill for the Council that included increasing SPD's budget by $5.4 million.,78,,
623,0.97,4362.191,4368.53,I think I will leave my comments there and turn it over to Greg.,78,,
624,0.97,4368.597,4371.934,So if you'd go ahead and flip to the first slide.,79,,
625,0.97,4372.0,4376.238,"As you stated, the bill is pretty state forward.",79,,
626,0.97,4376.305,4388.55,"It cuts $5.4 billion from SPD's budget, and adds $5.4 billion to fund the city Participatory budgeting process.",79,,
627,0.97,4388.617,4392.821,It has a Prizeo so it can't be spent.,79,,
628,0.97,4392.888,4395.124,More complicated than the bill is the background.,79,,
629,0.97,4395.19,4401.73,So I'm going to dive into that now for the public's sake.,79,,
630,0.97,4401.797,4406.001,I know members of the committee are well familiar with the background.,79,,
631,0.97,4406.068,4420.249,Stated that the Council would not support any budget amendments to increase the SPD budget to offset overtime expenditures above the funds that were initially budgeted in 2020 or 2021.,79,,
632,0.97,4420.315,4429.324,And subsequently reduced as part of the Mid-Year budget process last year.,79,,
633,0.97,4429.391,4441.37,Expressed Council's intend to reduce SPD's budget in 2021 in phases and to increase funding for community led research and Participatory funding.,79,,
634,0.97,4441.436,4444.339,"In late November, the Council received the budget request.",79,,
635,0.97,4444.406,4456.051,In that budget request there was an item that would have provided or did provide SPD with $5.4 million in new authority for three particular things.,79,,
636,0.97,4456.118,4470.632,"The first one was $1.9 million in new authority that was backed by FEMA revenues, and would reimburse the Department for the costs related to the Coronavirus pandemic and services that the department had been providing.",79,,
637,0.97,4470.699,4479.842,The second was $1.9 million to reimburse SPD for costs associated with parolees on paid parental leave.,79,,
638,0.97,4479.908,4493.422,"The third was to cover costs related to expenditure pay for officers that left the Department, and had to be paid out for their compensatory team.",79,,
639,0.97,4493.488,4519.915,"While the request didn't conflict with the resolution that I mentioned earlier, some Councilmembers had noted that SPD would not have needed additional appropriation authority had it not Overspent its overtime digit, due largely to the over employment of officers during the protests that occurred last summer.",79,,
640,0.97,4519.982,4530.325,Can you explain what you mean when you see the budget for these specific activities was not directly in conflict with resolution 13962?,80,,
641,0.97,4530.392,4531.193,"Thank you, Madam chair.",81,,
642,0.97,4531.26,4539.668,"What I mean is that the resolution, specifically focused on overtime expenditures.",81,,
643,0.97,4539.735,4544.873,And these three particular items that were in the budget were not directly for overtime expenditures.,81,,
644,0.97,4544.94,4569.598,"One piece of one of them was, but they were for unrelated items, and as I was saying, the nexus here is that the Council believed that the additional authority wouldn't have been needed, had SPD not over-spent its overtime budget last summer.",81,,
645,0.97,4569.665,4595.958,"As it relates specifically to the items that partially related to overtime, that would be the need to hire, or not hire, but to staff, back fill folks who are on parental leave, because you cannot hire to fill those positions.",82,,
646,0.97,4596.024,4598.694,They use overtime to fill them.,82,,
647,0.97,4598.76,4600.329,Is that correct?,82,,
648,0.97,4600.395,4600.762,That's correct.,83,,
649,0.97,4600.829,4614.242,"There is also 1 million of overtime that was used for planning, staffing, and traffic direction that had to do with first Responder testing sites for Covid.",83,,
650,0.97,4614.309,4626.355,"And so, in the sense that these were things that took from the overtime allocation, or budget for SPD, there's a nexus there.",83,,
651,0.97,4626.421,4631.259,So they're actually two of the three items that are directly related to overtime.,84,,
652,0.97,4631.326,4641.236,"Yes, although these wouldn't have appeared in SPD's overtime budget.",85,,
653,0.97,4641.303,4642.304,These were unplanned expenses.,85,,
654,0.97,4642.371,4648.91,Isn't overtime by its nature unplanned?,86,,
655,0.97,4648.977,4649.177,Yes.,87,,
656,0.97,4649.244,4653.115,"All right, thank you.",88,,
657,0.97,4653.181,4654.016,For the most part.,89,,
658,0.97,4654.082,4675.137,"So Anyways, back to, as I was saying, the nexus being that if SPD had not over-spent its overtime budget on demonstration costs it would have had $5.4 million available to cover these items, and that is noted in the recitals for the Council bill.",89,,
659,0.97,4675.203,4687.315,Also note that the Council was expecting that SPD would have significant salary savings in 2021 due to higher than anticipated attrition that was starting to occur in the early fall.,89,,
660,0.97,4687.382,4696.758,"And the counselor expected that that would continue through November and December, and as it turns out, that assumption turned out to be true.",89,,
661,0.97,4696.825,4699.194,Separations for sworn officers were at an all-time high last year.,89,,
662,0.97,4699.261,4706.601,"And at the end of the year, SPD indicated that the total of separating officers were 186.",89,,
663,0.97,4706.668,4721.85,"That's about twice what they had projected in the beginning of the year and as you can see on the slide here, that would result in about $7.7 million in salary savings that is available in 2021.",89,,
664,0.97,4721.917,4723.285,You see the Asterisk there.,89,,
665,0.97,4723.351,4739.668,"However, some of that savings could be redirected to fund additional separation costs that the Department is incurring, or may incur this year due to increased separations continuing into 2021.",89,,
666,0.97,4739.734,4741.77,With that I ask Aly to flip it again.,89,,
667,0.97,4741.837,4756.084,"So to give you an idea about how this looks, the projections you are seeing here, they're base the on a central staff analysis of the year end staffing report for 202, that SPD supplies.",89,,
668,0.97,4756.151,4763.558,And this particular analysis assumes that there would be 114 hires and 114 separations in 2021.,89,,
669,0.97,4763.625,4771.833,It also assumes the distribution of those hires and separations is going to somewhat return to historical averages.,89,,
670,0.97,4771.9,4786.314,"If that doesn't happen, and separations continue at the pace that has been even over the last six months, there could be additional salary savings available to the Department.",89,,
671,0.97,4786.381,4793.889,"Of course it would work in reverse, if there were fewer, then there would be less savings.",89,,
672,0.97,4793.955,4798.994,"So the first line that you may be familiar with, fully trained officer Actuals.",89,,
673,0.97,4799.06,4816.912,"The number of officers that are fully trained and can answer 911 calls or can serve as detectives, or for any other purpose, that wouldn't include recruits or some student officers that are not yet ready to be deployed.",89,,
674,0.97,4816.978,4817.445,That's the blue line.,89,,
675,0.97,4817.512,4824.419,"The gray line, the lesser number, is the number of officers that are in service.",89,,
676,0.97,4824.486,4834.362,"So what that means is the number of officers that are actually showing up to work every day, that you can deploy.",89,,
677,0.97,4834.429,4841.736,"The reason that number is lower, is that for folks out on disability or extended leave.",89,,
678,0.97,4841.803,4848.81,That number is at somewhat of an all-time high?,89,,
679,0.97,4848.877,4849.01,2021.,89,,
680,0.97,4849.077,4862.023,"The difference between officers that are available for deployment, and that is something that the Department is hoping will return to normal in 2021.",89,,
681,0.97,4862.09,4865.093,You can see that the projected line goes up there.,89,,
682,0.97,4865.16,4870.599,That particular data point was derived from the Department's report.,89,,
683,0.97,4870.665,4889.551,"Greg, this is the issue of numbers of officers on leave is an issue that I had been tracking in 2020, and there had been a small Uptick.",90,,
684,0.97,4889.618,4900.562,"But in looking at these numbers now, it's gone from what was a small Uptick to a huge, huge jump.",90,,
685,0.97,4900.629,4910.672,"I'm just wondering, what does, and of course we can hold these questions for next week.",90,,
686,0.97,4910.739,4922.55,", but if we know the answer now, it would be interesting to know what the Department attributes for the large number of officers who are fully trained, but are not in service.",90,,
687,0.97,4922.617,4923.285,Thank you Councilmember.,91,,
688,0.97,4923.351,4930.759,I am going to take you up on the offer to let them answer next week.,91,,
689,0.97,4930.825,4935.03,"Thank you, Greg.",92,,
690,0.97,4935.096,4936.331,Council President Gonzalez.,92,,
691,0.97,4936.398,4937.966,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,93,,
692,0.97,4938.033,4946.474,I wanted to go back to slide 4 if we can.,93,,
693,0.97,4946.541,4948.61,Thank you so much.,93,,
694,0.97,4948.677,4967.395,"So Greg, in your ramp up to getting us to this portion of the presentation, where it highlights that there could be as much as $7.7 million in salary savings in 2021, based on attrition, to date.",93,,
695,0.97,4967.462,4991.953,"I want to make sure that we don't walk away with the impression that this number, I want to make sure we walk away with the full understanding of this number, and sort of variables, that are at play as it relates to that $7.7 million production.",93,,
696,0.97,4992.02,5009.804,"In large part, because my understanding, is this $7.7 million figure that is here may not reflect some of the personnel costs associated with departments, like paid leave, et cetera.",93,,
697,0.97,5009.871,5035.697,"So can you again, so in other words, I'm a little nervous that the $7.7 million is going to be seen by some people is there's a hard $7.7 million available in salary savings here, when I think the reality is, this number may not reflect some sort of known and associated cost that would be discounted from this potential projection.",93,,
698,0.97,5035.764,5040.135,So can you talk a little about that?,93,,
699,0.97,5040.201,5043.037,"Yeah, thank you, Councilmember.",94,,
700,0.97,5043.104,5045.073,You're exactly right.,94,,
701,0.97,5045.14,5048.209,That's why the Asterisk is there on the slide.,94,,
702,0.97,5048.276,5060.522,The 7.7 million is a salary figure that is estimated based on the number of folks that are going to require pay in 2021.,94,,
703,0.97,5060.588,5066.528,"There are fewer of those folks, because you had all of the officers leave at the end of the year last year.",94,,
704,0.97,5066.594,5079.707,"However, salary savings, this particular pot of money, this $7.7 million is what the Department uses in any given year to fund its separation pay.",94,,
705,0.97,5079.774,5088.45,And so the Department is expecting that a number of officers are going to leave this year.,94,,
706,0.97,5088.516,5098.626,"And they would normally dip into this $7.7 million, the salary savings to be able to fund the separation pay for their vacation pay out, and for their compensatory PAYOUT.",94,,
707,0.97,5098.693,5112.173,"If the Council were to remove the separation, or were to remove salary savings from the Department's budget, then they're Affectively Unfunding separation pay for the officers that are leaving.",94,,
708,0.97,5112.24,5125.687,"The Department's memo notes this, and it notes that the estimate for separation pay for this year would be between somewhere between 1 and $1.8 million.",94,,
709,0.97,5125.753,5126.054,Go ahead.,95,,
710,0.97,5126.12,5139.601,"I was going to say, so that it was 1 point what?",96,,
711,0.97,5139.667,5140.502,"1.1, to 1.7.",97,,
712,0.97,5140.568,5141.603,Or 1.8.,97,,
713,0.97,5141.669,5145.54,"1.1, to 1.8, Yeah.",97,,
714,0.97,5145.607,5156.818,"So the 1.1, to $1.8 million is, that would need to be paid out of this $7.7 million in salary savings.",98,,
715,0.97,5156.885,5161.723,That is how the Department normally handles its separation pay.,99,,
716,0.97,5161.789,5175.27,"It makes some sense from a budget standpoint, because as people leave, the salaries that they no longer have to be paid can be used to pay off their vacation and their compensatory time.",99,,
717,0.97,5175.336,5182.844,"But if the salary savings aren't there, then the Department has to look elsewhere for that money.",99,,
718,0.97,5182.911,5183.478,Right.,100,,
719,0.97,5183.545,5183.678,Okay.,100,,
720,0.97,5183.745,5183.978,Thank you.,100,,
721,0.97,5184.045,5188.149,"So Aly, would you please jump forward to the table?",101,,
722,0.97,5188.216,5200.061,"So I've been talking a bit about how there were an extraordinary number of officers that left last year, and are creating salary savings in the police Department.",101,,
723,0.97,5200.128,5209.17,"The first line of this table, the average annual FTE, that is the funding for police officers and recruits and student officers.",101,,
724,0.97,5209.237,5212.874,So that's pretty much the sworn salary budget.,101,,
725,0.97,5212.941,5226.721,And the 2021 budget that you all adopted at the end of November determined that there was going to be a need for 1343 funded positions on average.,101,,
726,0.97,5226.788,5252.947,"So when I did the analysis to determine where they are in terms of need, the salary that they will need to pay their officers in 2021, it turned out that they're going to need only funding to support 1,289 officers, and this again, is based on the assumption that 114 leave, and 114 come back.",101,,
727,0.97,5253.014,5256.584,"If that doesn't happen, then things might change.",101,,
728,0.97,5256.651,5271.432,"But if that staffing plan is realized, then there will be 54 funded positions that will not be filled because the Department will not have officers to fill them.",101,,
729,0.97,5271.499,5281.776,And the salaries that are funding Those54 positions are what will be available for the $7.7 million in reduction that we talked about.,101,,
730,0.97,5281.843,5304.165,"And Greg, the number of 114 new hires, that is my recollection is, is that commensurate to the anticipated number of new hires that we budgeted for in 2020?",102,,
731,0.97,5304.232,5314.776,"But of course, weren't able to realize that number because of the Mayor's hiring freeze in June?",102,,
732,0.97,5314.842,5318.479,Where does that 114 come from?,102,,
733,0.97,5318.546,5323.651,The114 was the Department's original projection for their 2021 staffing plan.,103,,
734,0.97,5323.718,5339.033,"So when we went into the 2021 budget season, and the Council started Deliberating the 2021 budget, the SPD submitted a staffing plan that assumed that they would be able to get to 114 hires, so that's their number.",103,,
735,0.97,5339.1,5352.814,"It's based on a number of specific assumptions this year, including having a Seattle only Academy in Olympia, and some other assumptions that they have around hiring.",103,,
736,0.97,5352.88,5358.853,So that's their number.,103,,
737,0.97,5358.92,5369.597,So the assumptions behind the greatest number of officers the SPD believes they can hire in 2021 are actually changed from the assumptions in 2020.,104,,
738,0.97,5369.664,5371.833,"Yeah, I believe they're a bit hire.",105,,
739,0.97,5371.899,5376.304,I think in 2020 they were not quite 114.,105,,
740,0.97,5376.37,5376.804,Over 100.,105,,
741,0.97,5376.871,5379.24,I don't remember the exact number.,105,,
742,0.97,5379.307,5386.414,"They're higher this year, because Seattle is going to attempt to do the Seattle only Academy.",105,,
743,0.97,5386.481,5392.587,And again this is probably something I should flag for the next committee meeting.,106,,
744,0.97,5392.653,5419.614,I know a Seattle only Academy is an idea that's been Bandied about for many years and would just like to have a better understanding of the challenges in the past when this idea has come up as far back as I believe as chief Gil Kerlikowske.,106,,
745,0.97,5419.68,5419.981,All right.,107,,
746,0.97,5420.047,5428.79,"Well I'll let them talk a little more about it, and just go ahead and move on here.",107,,
747,0.97,5428.856,5451.813,"So SPD has noted that the reduction in $5.4 million that is contemplated by counsel bill 119981 would, to some extend, tie their hands in their ability to be able to fund as I say, separation pay that we discussed a little bit earlier.",108,,
748,0.97,5451.879,5458.719,Also to use that funding to Off- set some new issues that they want to address.,108,,
749,0.97,5458.786,5470.231,One of those is that the 2021 budget assumed a civilian vacancy rate.,108,,
750,0.97,5470.298,5484.812,"As such, SPD is now carrying a vacancy assumption that requires them to keep $4 million open in their budget, and hold open 40 positions on the civilian side.",108,,
751,0.97,5484.879,5500.027,"So what that's doing is, it's requiring that SPD leave open a number of positions, some of them community facing, and working directly with communities, such as crime prevention Coordinators.",108,,
752,0.97,5500.094,5506.901,"So SPD has indicated in their memo, if the salary savings were not cut.",108,,
753,0.97,5506.968,5512.84,They would use $1.4 million to go ahead and hire some of those positions that they otherwise could not do.,108,,
754,0.97,5512.907,5518.279,Then the last item that they have requested funding for is funding for technology upgrades.,108,,
755,0.97,5518.346,5520.014,I'm not going too go too much into that.,108,,
756,0.97,5520.081,5523.284,I think the chair touched on some of that.,108,,
757,0.97,5523.351,5530.524,Some of that is for technology that would allow them to continue to comply with the consent decree.,108,,
758,0.97,5530.591,5542.77,"Some of it is for technology that would allow them to do Online call processing, and potentially alleviate the need for officers to take police reports in person.",108,,
759,0.97,5542.837,5545.373,They can talk more about that next week.,108,,
760,0.97,5545.439,5571.132,"So I'll just finish up by noting that the Council had included in the 2021 adopted budget, a Provan proviso that assumed SPD would realize the same amount of money, $5 million in salary savings due to the difference between staffing projections and actual staffing.",108,,
761,0.97,5571.198,5573.167,"Obviously, that has happened.",108,,
762,0.97,5573.234,5574.035,As I have noted.,108,,
763,0.97,5574.101,5579.974,The difference between original projections and staffing is going to create about $7.7 million.,108,,
764,0.97,5580.041,5591.919,So that is one question for the Council is how this particular bill would relate to that proviso.,108,,
765,0.97,5591.986,5596.991,"As you can see, there are other that have been provided.",108,,
766,0.97,5597.058,5598.059,We talked about separation pay.,108,,
767,0.97,5598.125,5605.199,One we haven't talked about is overtime costs associated with patrol Augmentation.,108,,
768,0.97,5605.266,5617.311,The department has indicated it would potentially use salary savings that might be cut here to pay for overtime to Backfill for staffing shortages.,108,,
769,0.97,5617.378,5623.517,"I didn't go into the detail on patrol staffing, but patrol staffing is down quite a bit.",108,,
770,0.97,5623.584,5629.69,There was a large number of separations with officers that had less than 7 years of service.,108,,
771,0.97,5629.757,5634.328,Typically those that are in the patrol arena.,108,,
772,0.97,5634.395,5649.443,"There were originally last year, if you look back to December, there were about 668 officers that were reported in 911 response.",108,,
773,0.97,5649.51,5649.844,"I'm sorry, 588.",108,,
774,0.97,5649.91,5658.419,And that's down from 668 earlier in the year.,108,,
775,0.97,5658.486,5663.457,So there was a pretty significant drop in patrol and 911 response.,108,,
776,0.97,5663.524,5668.529,They would use some of this to back fill that.,108,,
777,0.97,5668.596,5679.473,"The Department will also talk about how the Covid vaccine may create a situation where special events come Online quicker than they were expected, when the 2021 budget was being written.",108,,
778,0.97,5679.54,5686.48,So there may be a need for special events over time funding.,108,,
779,0.97,5686.547,5693.954,Then Council identified priorities that Councilmember Herbold talked about at the beginning of the presentation.,108,,
780,0.97,5694.021,5698.592,"Things that SPD needs around evidence storage, around I.T., and public disclosure.",108,,
781,0.97,5698.659,5701.595,Those are things that could be explored.,108,,
782,0.97,5701.662,5711.739,We talked a little bit about the proviso that would relate to this $5.4 million.,108,,
783,0.97,5711.806,5716.277,"And Aly, is this the last slide, or do we have anything else?",108,,
784,0.97,5716.343,5717.178,Nothing else.,108,,
785,0.97,5717.244,5736.297,"With that I'll ask if there's any questions, and as Councilmember Herbold said, they'll be here next week to talk about their requests, should they be allowed to retain the salary that would be cut by this Council bill 119981.",108,,
786,0.97,5736.363,5745.673,One question I have relates to the question of the separation pay.,109,,
787,0.97,5745.739,5775.503,"If the analysis shows that there is a potential for $7.7 million in salary savings, and the proposed legislation would cut 5.4, seems like there's sufficient funding to pay for the $1.8 million for separation pay built in.",109,,
788,0.97,5775.569,5803.063,"You know, I'm not suggesting that again, I've said numerous times that I'm not planning to be Ridged on this bill, and I'm willing to consider SPD's recommendations for a number other than $5.4 million to reduce.",109,,
789,0.97,5803.13,5818.812,"But I'm questioning whether or not they recognize that there's, you know, there's a difference between $.3 million between 7.7, and the 5.4.",109,,
790,0.97,5818.879,5822.583,I think they probably do recognize that.,110,,
791,0.97,5822.65,5824.785,You're right on.,110,,
792,0.97,5824.852,5829.223,The math is pretty straight forward.,110,,
793,0.97,5829.29,5836.697,They are estimating at the high end that they're going to need $1.8 million for additional separations.,110,,
794,0.97,5836.764,5845.573,That would mean that you'd have a year that would look more like last year than year's previous.,110,,
795,0.97,5845.639,5850.311,"So Yeah, that would work out.",110,,
796,0.97,5850.377,5851.378,Yes.,110,,
797,0.97,5851.445,5855.916,Nothing more to say.,110,,
798,0.97,5855.983,5871.532,Any other questions from Councilmembers or Anythings that staff would like to highlight that we may have missed?,111,,
799,0.97,5871.599,5872.633,Not seeing any hands raised.,111,,
800,0.97,5872.7,5883.177,So I'm glad we finally got through the first step in deliberation around this bill.,111,,
801,0.97,5883.244,5892.82,"And I think, you know that we have had some time with SPD's memo in response to the bill.",111,,
802,0.97,5892.886,5918.879,"I'm hoping that we can work with central staff to develop some of our questions in advance, as well as some of the priorities that the Council might have, either priorities that we share with the Department for funding, or priorities that are not addressed in the Department's memo to central staff.",111,,
803,0.97,5918.946,5936.664,"So to the extent that we can work to surface some of those between now and our next meeting, I think that would be very, very helpful, and make for a productive meeting.",111,,
804,0.97,5936.73,5936.964,All right.,111,,
805,0.97,5937.031,5939.133,"Great, thank you, everybody.",111,,
806,0.97,5939.199,5943.404,And that was the last item on our agenda.,111,,
807,0.97,5943.47,5950.911,And the next public safety and human services committee meeting is scheduled for March 9th.,111,,
808,0.97,5950.978,5959.32,"Before we adjourn, any questions or comments from our colleagues?",111,,
809,0.97,5959.386,5962.423,"Seeing none, it is 11:10, and we are adjourned.",111,,
810,0.97,5962.489,5965.559,"Thank you, everybody.",111,,
