145,0.97,830.729,844.543,This morning Carolyn Bickett the South Seattle Emerald published her 21st article over the last 14 months investigating the failures and corruption in our police accountability system.,49,,
146,0.97,844.543,851.083,Today's article reveals shocking mismanagement and misdeeds that require the city to seek investigations by entities outside the city.,49,,
147,0.97,851.083,863.796,"Yesterday at Council briefing Councilmember Nelson stated she was ""sorry, ashamed and feels deeply responsible"" for the recent and killings in Seattle.",49,,
148,0.97,863.796,887.82,"Councilmember Nelson, if your sorrow, shame and responsibility are so great when you're not responsible for paying the salary of the shooter, paying for the shooter's gun and bullets, how much greater should it be when you are responsible for paying for these things?",49,,
149,0.97,887.82,897.763,"Councilmember Nelson and all Council members, where was your sorrow, shame and responsibility when the SPD killed a person in behavioral crisis on January 5? a person considered so insignificant by our accountability system that over two months later we still don't know his name.",49,,
150,0.97,897.763,906.338,"That was the 19th person, the 19th person suffering a mental health crisis and murdered by the SPD since the SPD murdered Williams.",49,,
151,0.97,906.338,919.118,Are please accountability system has been--we should have empathy and take responsibility for all victims of gun violence.,49,,
152,0.97,919.118,924.99,"But, a Councilmember needs to focus on the killings they directly pay for.",49,,
153,0.97,924.99,936.201,"We need to build through a city initiative and accountability system that provides full civilian community control over police policy, police misconduct investigations and police discipline.",49,,
154,0.97,936.201,940.973,Go to Seattle Stop.Org.,49,,

157,0.97,954.186,956.488,I am Kimberly.,51,,
158,0.97,956.488,964.33,I wholeheartedly support the policy.,51,,
159,0.97,964.33,974.974,[Indiscernible] the numbers of gig workers [Indiscernible] smaller and smaller.,51,,
160,0.97,974.974,983.916,You need to support this legislation [Indiscernible].,51,,
161,0.97,983.916,986.085,We have gone over how this policy created benefits gig workers.,51,,
162,0.97,986.085,992.791,Our like to mention other reasons--why you might support it.,51,,
163,0.97,992.791,1000.966,The gig companies race to the bottom pushed me over the edge into homelessness.,51,,
164,0.97,1000.966,1006.405,If many of you are serious about the homelessness problem in the city you should want to support legislation that.,51,,
165,0.97,1006.405,1012.544,Another reason is a positive impact of a small business and the economic health of the city.,51,,
166,0.97,1012.544,1017.383,There are many restaurants in Seattle that rely quite a bit on the gig economy.,51,,
167,0.97,1017.383,1028.16,It is important that the gig center is strong and healthy.,51,,
168,0.97,1028.16,1036.101,"Tens of thousands of gig worker with enough to pay their business expenses, personal bills and have money in their pockets will be spending a huge amount of money right here in our city and many, many small businesses.",51,,
169,0.97,1036.101,1039.338,Something they are not able to do now because of the pay they receive for their work.,51,,
170,0.97,1039.338,1045.844,The companies are going to--minimum wage.,51,,
171,0.97,1045.844,1051.75,Do not be Bamboozled.,51,,
172,0.97,1051.75,1058.924,The pay policy simply takes into account actual mileage and expenses we pay out and gives us at least minimum wage after expenses are paid and have been accounted for.,51,,
173,0.97,1058.924,1066.465,"Just like any other business, the net profit is income minus expenses.",51,,
174,0.97,1066.465,1067.399,We too are small businesses.,51,,
175,0.97,1067.399,1068.0,Don't forget that.,51,,
176,0.97,1068.0,1078.444,Any small business is going to ask for certain amount to cover their expenses plus a healthy profit.,51,,
177,0.97,1078.444,1082.848,And we are asking --,51,,
178,0.97,1082.848,1095.26,Our next Speaker is Carmen followed by well Lynn.,52,,
179,0.97,1096.095,1108.607,"Carmen, you want to press Star six to be Unmuted.",52,,

198,0.97,1299.765,1311.143,It's as if we are waiting for the protesters to give the Democratic party approval to approve these types of surveillance equipment which we know they never will.,57,,
199,0.97,1311.143,1362.728,"I think it is obvious the city Council, Mayor, prosecutors and human services Department lend a requirement is endangering and discriminating against innocent law-abiding homeless citizens who are helping by using most money from the homeless crisis to treat and focus on lead and ACLU funded idea of running interference for all these evil customs violating repeat offending criminals . and I hate to say it, but, you know, some of them are Bipoc--escalating violence were evil adults were allowed to stay out of jail are Misguiding youth and having them do their bidding.",57,,
200,0.97,1362.728,1368.033,And Outsmarting the police chief who has only been eight years of Crime-Fighting out of his 25 years of trying to do is this relation outreach.,57,,
201,0.97,1368.033,1373.705,Do you know that he only focused on the crime Hotspots that the media was reporting on?,57,,
202,0.97,1373.705,1398.263,And then specifically only clearing that area to the point where you couldn't be a bust writer without being harassed by the cops telling you you can't be . But everyone around there including the evil drug pushing operations of Pioneer square and West Lake at nighttime has been reclaimed by all the evil criminals that you all have a --,57,,

215,0.97,1474.472,1476.741,The technology is a covert Nonconsensual invasion of privacy.,59,,
216,0.97,1476.741,1487.752,If moved from the master list it would create a dangerous situation and the surveillance technology--public oversight or control.,59,,
217,0.97,1487.752,1492.257,If it was removed from the master list it would be in scope for the city auditors review.,59,,

231,0.97,1554.486,1560.792,The gig industry is the only industry that allows me to set my own hours while working at a pace I'm comfortable with.,67,,
232,0.97,1560.792,1564.029,There are thousands of gig workers with disabilities.,67,,
233,0.97,1564.029,1571.336,Often gig work is the only source of income.,67,,
234,0.97,1571.336,1577.842,Lobbying for the ability to force workers to work more with less pay and implementing ways to undermine the flexibility I depend on.,67,,
235,0.97,1577.842,1587.786,They are financially in a fitting keeping more and more profits for themselves which legislation--will never invest in the workers.,67,,
236,0.97,1587.786,1598.363,Capping the pay campaign standard policy this year will allow me to earn ways in which I can thrive and flourish.,67,,
237,0.97,1598.363,1600.198,And not simply survive to work one more day.,67,,
238,0.97,1600.198,1608.907,We are trusting lawmakers to pass a policy for us because we are not disposable and should not be exploited.,67,,
239,0.97,1608.907,1610.508,Thank you for your support.,67,,
240,0.97,1610.508,1616.982,Our next Speaker is well Lynn.,68,,

247,0.97,1651.583,1659.491,I started doing the gig work February 2020 because I just moved to Seattle and I had time to figure out what should I do.,73,,
248,0.97,1659.491,1676.141,"When I started doing the Part- time job I started to grow great experience with the flexible work time, reasonable pay and the Hardy put in the more you get the urge.",73,,
249,0.97,1676.141,1678.676,No contact with the customer which was good for the pandemic situation.,73,,
250,0.97,1678.676,1683.281,Every day I would go to the warehouse location where they would cut me an account and finish the bag job.,73,,
251,0.97,1683.281,1690.989,They treat us like employees most of the time even though we are an independent contractor.,73,,
252,0.97,1690.989,1695.46,"They pay a guarantee for hours, it was only $16.75.",73,,
253,0.97,1695.46,1698.897,That was already below Seattle minimum wage.,73,,
254,0.97,1698.897,1713.111,Once you add the miles and taxes it costs like six dollars or seven dollars per hour.,73,,
255,0.97,1713.111,1722.053,They encourage everyone to work on demand which means you make less than minimum pay and that happens most of the time of the day.,73,,
256,0.97,1722.053,1733.431,The other driver would have to work in Rush-Hour not making enough money and they cut the weekly reward costing the driver 60% less each week.,73,,
257,0.97,1733.431,1740.538,"I was here, I want that to be changed.",73,,

272,0.97,1802.7,1809.007,"We want to hear what your concerns are but when we hear hate speech over and over, that doesn't help the message if you are trying to get one to us.",78,,
273,0.97,1809.007,1814.078,"So, in the future, soon, we will be exercising that right.",78,,
