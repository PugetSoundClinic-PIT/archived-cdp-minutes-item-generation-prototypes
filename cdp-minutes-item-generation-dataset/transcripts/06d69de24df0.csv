185,0.97,1010.576,1019.184,"Councilmember Lewis, I see that you do have an amendment.",53,,
186,0.97,1019.184,1030.362,You are welcome to ask the Council consider the amendment before you address the underlying bill.,53,,
187,0.97,1030.362,1033.399,Or you could address the underlying bill first and then have us consider the amendment.,53,,
188,0.97,1033.399,1046.578,I'm happy to in whatever order you think would make most sense that would help the Council have the most productive conversation about the bill that will ultimately be before us.,53,,
189,0.97,1046.578,1052.518,"If you want to address the amendment first, completely happy to have that happen first.",53,,
190,0.97,1052.518,1055.521,I think I would like to address the amendment first.,54,,
191,0.97,1055.521,1056.522,It's technical in nature.,54,,
192,0.97,1056.522,1063.562,I moved to amend Council bill 119942 as presented on amendment one which was recently distributed.,54,,

199,0.97,1086.218,1086.852,Thank you.,58,,
200,0.97,1086.852,1093.559,"As I mentioned in briefing this morning, it is technical in nature in that the opinion of the city attorney's office as well.",58,,
201,0.97,1093.559,1098.43,As well as central staff.,58,,
202,0.97,1098.43,1120.786,"The distribution Lastly clarifies the amount of money it just the is being given and how that can be spent and a necessary change to make sure that this legislation, the changes, the proviso from the summer session can go forward as we intended.",58,,
203,0.97,1120.786,1131.997,I would ask that we vote on this and then move on to discussing the legislation more Holistically.,58,,
204,0.97,1131.997,1136.802,Are there any questions or comments on the amendment?,59,,
205,0.97,1136.802,1146.979,"Hearing none, I will ask that the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of amendment one as described by Councilmember Lewis.",59,,
206,0.97,1146.979,1147.613,Councilmember Strauss.,60,,

214,0.97,1170.335,1171.069,Councilmember Mosqueda.,66,,
215,0.97,1171.069,1172.237,Yes.,67,,
216,0.97,1172.237,1173.705,Councilmember Pedersen.,68,,
217,0.97,1173.705,1178.81,Yes.,69,,
218,0.97,1178.81,1179.344,Councilmember Sawant.,70,,
219,0.97,1179.344,1181.413,Yes.,71,,
220,0.97,1181.413,1182.047,Council President Gonzalez.,72,,
221,0.97,1182.047,1186.351,Yes.,73,,
222,0.97,1186.351,1187.553,Eight in favor none opposed.,74,,
223,0.97,1187.686,1192.958,The motion carries in the amendment is adopted.,75,,
224,0.97,1192.958,1197.162,Councilmember Lewis I will handed back over to you to address the bill as amended.,75,,
225,0.97,1197.162,1199.331,Before we hear other comments from your colleagues.,75,,
226,0.97,1199.331,1210.542,"And as is required by the rules, you will have the last word to closeout debate once we have heard from others.",75,,
227,0.97,1210.542,1214.58,"Thank you very much, Madam President.",76,,
228,0.97,1214.58,1223.755,It is good to see that it was distributed to all Councilmembers at 201.,76,,
229,0.97,1223.755,1252.985,"We did get the updated framework agreement between the executive and providers to continue to go through and go forward on this conversation that has been convened, to really make sure we are working together as a council as the broader community and Mayor, to start making material progress on getting outreach and services to folks who really, really need it right now, especially now that we are very clearly on the doorstep of winter.",76,,
230,0.97,1252.985,1276.141,This framework and conversation around it has been very productive for all of us to make sure we are talking and working through ending 2020 with action and making sure we are getting these out into the field for people who need them.,76,,
231,0.97,1276.141,1279.611,Resources around hygiene and behavioral mental health and all the other things that are authorized in this bill.,76,,
232,0.97,1279.611,1291.556,And where there is an agreement and a framework to expand these resources and get them out to the folks who need them.,76,,
233,0.97,1291.556,1293.825,I want to be clear about what this legislation doesn't do.,76,,
234,0.97,1293.825,1302.167,It does not make any commitments in terms of what the city side of things on managing outreach is going to be for 2021.,76,,
235,0.97,1302.167,1304.169,We have a variety of proposals that have come forward.,76,,
236,0.97,1304.169,1330.395,"Executive sent down a proposal for the team that they would like to have an Hst similar to the proposal that is in this legislation to have a coordinating team that is not out in the field, to have an engagement policy that is centered on provider outreach for folks with expertise and connections in the community to be the face and implement her's of our outreach policy.",76,,
237,0.97,1330.395,1342.774,And for the city to be in a coordinating and service providing role that is enhancing the mission of those providers.,76,,
238,0.97,1342.774,1344.81,This is a good start to finish out 2020.,76,,
239,0.97,1344.81,1354.92,It is good that we have been able to convene a conversation where we are moving up closer to a consensus in this area.,76,,
240,0.97,1354.92,1363.495,And we will continue to talk about what the model for 2021 is going to look like throughout the fall budget session.,76,,
241,0.97,1363.495,1380.345,"What we cannot wait any longer, based on the urgency and need to really start deploying these resources, that is evident in all the districts of the city, that sense of urgency.",76,,
242,0.97,1380.345,1384.015,"With that, I just want to say this isn't the end, this is the beginning.",76,,
243,0.97,1384.015,1385.65,We have a long way to go still.,76,,
244,0.97,1385.65,1387.052,But it's a good start.,76,,
245,0.97,1387.052,1390.522,Everyone has been working in good faith.,76,,
246,0.97,1390.522,1394.559,I encourage everyone to read the framework that was distributed.,76,,
247,0.97,1394.559,1402.067,I had briefly glanced at it but definitely want to spend more Timewith that document.,76,,
248,0.97,1402.067,1431.396,"This really does represent material step forward on a new model of outreach that is no longer going to Overemphasize the role of police . no longer going to Overemphasize or rather, I should say, under emphasize the need for our service provider community to be in the base of these efforts and all the neighborhoods we serve.",76,,
249,0.97,1431.396,1447.813,With that I would move that we--I look forward to further conversation--but we will certainly encourage and hope that you will forward with this today and that we continue to build on this in the 2021 budget.,76,,
250,0.97,1447.813,1460.192,And make sure the resources we have appropriated 2022 get out there is the expectation of the provider community in supporting this measure.,76,,
251,0.97,1460.192,1463.495,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,77,,
252,0.97,1463.495,1473.405,Other any questions or comments on the bill for my colleagues?,77,,
253,0.97,1473.405,1475.74,Councilmember Sawant and then Councilmember Morales.,77,,
254,0.97,1475.74,1497.162,"I intend to vote no on this bill because what actually does is shrink the scale of the proviso passed by the Council to stop the encampment Removals or as homeless activists have said, stop the Sweeps.",78,,
255,0.97,1497.162,1508.74,"One third shrinks the scale by almost a third, to $2 million.",78,,
256,0.97,1508.74,1519.317,"The proviso basically said the Mayor could only use the funds allocated to the so-called navigation team which does the Sweeps of homeless people, that could use those funds to do genuine outreach of homeless services instead.",78,,
257,0.97,1519.317,1523.955,Councilmember Lewis says everyone has been working on good faith.,78,,
258,0.97,1523.955,1531.796,I think that is true of the workers at reach and the employees of the human services Department.,78,,
259,0.97,1531.796,1548.513,But I don't believe that is true of the Mayor's office which is actually been an obstacle to getting any kind of change away from Removals of homeless Encampments and homeless human beings.,78,,
260,0.97,1548.513,1558.089,Everything else has been discussed as part of this bill suggest principles and agreed framework of service providers.,78,,
261,0.97,1558.089,1562.794,All of which of course is moving in a good direction but could've happened anyway and do not require this legislation.,78,,
262,0.97,1562.794,1568.633,This is precisely for shrinking the scale of the proviso.,78,,
263,0.97,1568.633,1591.156,What the Council is really voting on is whether or not to shrink the Sweeps . The only reason it's being discussed is because Mayor Durkan refused to follow the proviso . As of last Friday my office checked with city council staff and it is still not being acted on.,78,,
264,0.97,1591.156,1592.624,The proviso is not being acted on.,78,,
265,0.97,1592.624,1601.833,It is true because the Mayor vetoed the budget it did not legally take effect until last Thursday.,78,,
266,0.97,1601.833,1604.369,But there is nothing stopping the Mayor from voluntarily following the proviso earlier.,78,,
267,0.97,1604.369,1613.144,So I don't actually take these claims about a sense of urgency at face value.,78,,
268,0.97,1613.144,1625.357,The only reason Mayor Durkan chose not to follow the proviso is because she was confident the city council would give her retroactive permission to do so in this bill will do just that.,78,,
269,0.97,1625.357,1639.104,I will say also I am really taken aback that this retroactive permission is being considered before the Mayor takes any material steps to follow the proviso.,78,,
270,0.97,1639.104,1653.551,Perhaps it would be different if it were December and the Mayor had dutifully followed the legal requirements and was then after that asking for retroactive permission for her slow start.,78,,
271,0.97,1653.551,1656.021,This bill gives her permission for being late before she even Beins.,78,,
272,0.97,1656.021,1663.328,What is to prevent her from delaying a couple of months and then bringing another bill trying to get permission for the next delay?,78,,
273,0.97,1663.328,1665.53,Don't know that is not going to happen.,78,,
274,0.97,1665.53,1676.541,"The Sweeps of homeless Encampments are cruel, inhumane and ineffective.",78,,
275,0.97,1676.541,1680.745,People are removed again and again and again sometimes from the same location but there is nowhere for them to go.,78,,
276,0.97,1680.745,1681.613,There are no alternatives.,78,,
277,0.97,1681.613,1696.628,"There have been well over 1000 Sweeps and they are clearly not working and they are wasting millions of dollars, forcing people to move, losing their belongings and becoming more and more desperate . The Mayor should've stopped sweeping people years ago.",78,,
278,0.97,1696.628,1703.668,It is not possible for my office to support a bill to retroactively give the Mayor permission for dealing after the proviso has been passed.,78,,
279,0.97,1703.668,1708.74,Thank you.,78,,
280,0.97,1708.74,1716.147,"Thank you Councilmember Sawant, Councilmember Morales.",79,,
281,0.97,1716.147,1716.748,Thank you.,80,,
282,0.97,1716.748,1721.986,I have a couple questions for the sponsor.,80,,
283,0.97,1721.986,1725.69,Before and want.,80,,
284,0.97,1725.69,1741.506,"Councilmember Lewis, can you talk a little bit about how the team describes your amendment as materially different from the it just be that the executive has proposed in the 2021 budget.",80,,
285,0.97,1741.506,1746.311,"Yes, I can answer that question.",81,,
286,0.97,1746.311,1757.922,This proviso change Oh is not descriptive in terms of division of labor as to what these Ftes can and cannot do.,81,,
287,0.97,1757.922,1767.532,It represents a four employee reduction from the number of Hst employees on the old navigation teams.,81,,
288,0.97,1767.532,1770.135,So it's a smaller team.,81,,
289,0.97,1770.135,1776.441,The team we got a presentation about three weeks ago is also eight Ftes.,81,,
290,0.97,1776.441,1786.818,So they could use those anyway they see fit that is consistent with the conditions of the proviso.,81,,
291,0.97,1786.818,1791.856,Which explicitly says they cannot be doing direct outreach.,81,,
292,0.97,1791.856,1798.363,They essentially can be doing things other than direct outreach.,81,,
293,0.97,1798.363,1804.869,Coordinating the city departments divide assistance.,81,,
294,0.97,1804.869,1820.084,"It's important to note the $245,000 which is the only amount of money released, less than a quarter million dollars is released for the last two months of this year.",81,,
295,0.97,1820.084,1820.952,For the Hsd team.,81,,
296,0.97,1820.952,1822.554,That expires at the end of the year.,81,,
297,0.97,1822.554,1828.459,That does not guarantee that Hsd will have the eight Ftes any longer than December 31.,81,,
298,0.97,1828.459,1837.802,That would depend on what our conversations are.,81,,
299,0.97,1837.802,1842.674,"In terms of what we want the long-term team, whatever it is, to look like beyond that.",81,,
300,0.97,1842.674,1859.123,That is something I would add that the community are doing to go back and forth on this is also heavily discussing what will be the makeup of the team and what will the roles be?,81,,
301,0.97,1859.123,1868.633,"Sorry, I guess what I'm trained to understand, maybe this is a question for Jeff, is Jeff on?",82,,
302,0.97,1868.633,1874.839,Councilmember Morales Jeff is available . that was the time to ask questions.,83,,
303,0.97,1874.839,1888.152,"So, I just want to be clear that I understand the 2021 proposal calls for 18 members.",84,,
304,0.97,1888.152,1899.464,"As I understand it the roles are team manager, outreach manager, communications manager, field coordinator, data analyst, Department coordinator, two assistance navigators.",84,,
305,0.97,1899.464,1902.967,Right?,84,,
306,0.97,1902.967,1911.943,That is my memory from presentation.,85,,
307,0.97,1911.943,1915.78,"Right, so those are roles that existed at the previous team and are continuing.",85,,
308,0.97,1915.78,1929.394,"I guess what I'm trying to understand is aside from the intent to coordinate outreach work, we know how this team would be from the navigation team.",85,,
309,0.97,1929.394,1939.27,"Right, so, on the old navigation team there are a result sideboards in the proviso the limit what they can be doing.",86,,
310,0.97,1939.27,1952.517,That was important to the provider community since they don't want a team that is going to be out there competing with on the ground outreach efforts with a monopoly of resources that other providers don't have access to.,86,,
311,0.97,1952.517,1966.731,"And that is something that under this, if the team were to have that mission, they would not be able to access this money for those Ftes.",86,,
312,0.97,1966.731,1968.299,"I mean, that is a material difference.",86,,
313,0.97,1968.299,1970.768,They will no longer have city employees be agents of outreach.,86,,
314,0.97,1970.768,1983.047,"And certainly won't have police be integrated as part of the team effort, per Visa remains fully tried in the 2020 package.",86,,
315,0.97,1983.047,1990.154,"I'm sorry, one more point I guess and I will wrap up.",87,,
316,0.97,1990.154,2005.57,I just feel like this proposal AMENDS the proviso that we passed this summer by shifting away from the navigation team to service providers.,87,,
317,0.97,2005.57,2008.172,"You didn't support, I understand.",87,,
318,0.97,2008.172,2020.184,"What I don't see is how this amendment itself, does anything more than bring the 2021 proposed navigation team on time Online a few months earlier than proposed.",87,,
319,0.97,2020.184,2035.333,"It's frustrating for me and Disheartening that this legislative body voted to pass a budget, unequivocally stated our intent to shift away from a navigation team model and provide more resources to providers.",87,,
320,0.97,2035.333,2045.877,We voted not once but twice . I want to thank the service providers who I know have been having long and frequent conversations with the executive branch.,87,,
321,0.97,2045.877,2052.116,They have really been at the table to hammer out a deal for these dollars to finally get out the door.,87,,
322,0.97,2052.116,2063.428,I want to thank the providers for working on the spring work which is totally separate from this legislation . I'm excited to see that.,87,,
323,0.97,2063.428,2069.367,And I know those conversations need to continue to make sure the last unresolved issues are met.,87,,
324,0.97,2069.367,2075.84,My understanding is there is a commitment between the executive and providers in the next couple of days.,87,,
325,0.97,2075.84,2081.145,So we can make sure these resources get put to the intended use.,87,,
326,0.97,2081.145,2097.361,"But I have to say, I believe this legislation which in my mind Disregards the incredible ongoing work that has led to this framework . really the only purpose of this is to bring back some version of the navigation team.",87,,
327,0.97,2097.361,2117.281,It's also my understanding that with the executive it would address serious concerns several providers have . But a deal to address those issues is contingent upon passing this amendment.,87,,
328,0.97,2117.281,2125.99,"So I will be voting in favor of it solely to help make sure that those issues are addressed, those concerns are addressed.",87,,
329,0.97,2125.99,2131.696,Thank you Councilmember Morales for those comments.,88,,
330,0.97,2131.696,2132.497,Councilmember Herbold.,88,,
331,0.97,2132.497,2135.766,Thank you so much.,89,,
332,0.97,2135.766,2146.11,I really appreciate the work of the has been done thus far to get us to this point.,89,,
333,0.97,2146.11,2154.685,"So, first off, many thanks the outreach providers who worked tirelessly for the last few weeks on coming to the agreement.",89,,
334,0.97,2154.685,2160.658,About a new framework for outreach an encampment management.,89,,
335,0.97,2160.658,2174.338,I remember at the end of September I think it was the timber 30th when we received a letter from the deputy about the next steps after Council action to override the Mayor's veto on three issues.,89,,
336,0.97,2174.338,2176.607,One of those issues was the end of the navigation team.,89,,
337,0.97,2176.607,2185.55,In that letter was no description on how to activate the funds provided by the Council for outreach.,89,,
338,0.97,2185.55,2193.424,I immediately reached out to representatives from our provider community with a request that they allies to help build something new with the funds provided by the Council.,89,,
339,0.97,2193.424,2211.742,"I want to really thank you for responding with urgency and I appreciate the many, many hours you have been spending working with the executives on the framework, recognize the framework is a beginning place, another then place.",89,,
340,0.97,2211.742,2220.117,I want to thank also Councilmember Lewis for leading the discussion and the deputy Mayor for being a willing partner in the discussions.,89,,
341,0.97,2220.117,2243.608,"And really being open and operating in a way that shows I think a lot of goodwill towards something that the Council, executive and provider community can get behind together.",89,,
342,0.97,2243.608,2244.475,As a unified front.,89,,
343,0.97,2244.475,2254.385,"I understand the framework that was shared with Council members again, it's a new effort to do this work differently.",89,,
344,0.97,2254.385,2257.655,And for us all to work together to build this new approach in alignment.,89,,
345,0.97,2257.655,2264.862,"As I mentioned before the framework isn't at the end of the process, it is just the beginning.",89,,
346,0.97,2264.862,2272.303,There is more work to be done operation wise and framework Oer the next several weeks to ensure the new approach truly serves the needs of people living in the shelter.,89,,
347,0.97,2272.303,2276.707,Groups of people living in Encampments.,89,,
348,0.97,2276.707,2281.879,And the neighboring neighbors and businesses.,89,,
349,0.97,2281.879,2297.461,"This action will reinforce Council efforts from September to make available funds to the executive so outreach can continue in 2020 . again, it's a mark of good faith in which the conversations have receded.",89,,
350,0.97,2297.461,2309.84,I want to uplift one portion shared framework that I think is particularly important to highlight.,89,,
351,0.97,2309.84,2316.747,It says the city concurs that removal will not be the first response and will collaborate with providers to address obstruction and behavior.,89,,
352,0.97,2316.747,2325.456,"Full and respectful dialogue in problem-solving, engaging unsheltered and House residents addressing specific neighborhoods needs and priorities.",89,,
353,0.97,2325.456,2337.668,"You know, neighborhood needs include everybody to be present in the neighborhood.",89,,
354,0.97,2337.668,2342.606,From people living in shelters to housed people and people who work or frequent parks or businesses there.,89,,
355,0.97,2342.606,2352.917,I think this new framework recognizes the value of everyone in this necessary Problem- solving model.,89,,
356,0.97,2352.917,2368.132,"Really, that is what I see, a shift towards a problem-solving model rather than a model that assumes that when outreach is sent out, the purpose of the outreach is to remove the encampment.",89,,
357,0.97,2368.132,2379.944,"The agreement also addresses the need for the city to continue to submit significant resources not only to outreach but shelter, housing, hygiene, health promotion and harm reduction.",89,,
358,0.97,2379.944,2390.254,"Putting Sharps and containers, and outreach in Coronation with public health.",89,,
359,0.97,2390.254,2397.962,I am really glad this agreement has been reached in time for Council to consider what it might mean for the 2021 budget.,89,,
360,0.97,2397.962,2409.974,If we can accomplish this works today from a foundation of principle I think this will help propel us for the ongoing discussions.,89,,
361,0.97,2409.974,2411.142,From this agreed-upon starting point.,89,,
362,0.97,2411.142,2414.678,I have been in ongoing conversations with outreach providers on the front lines of this work every day.,89,,
363,0.97,2414.678,2430.895,"I know they have indicated there is support was the transmission, with the new--I am working my commitment to continue the conversation with the executive providers.",89,,
364,0.97,2430.895,2440.771,"Councilmember Lewis, I do know that you Referenced the receipt of the 201 new framework.",89,,
365,0.97,2440.771,2444.809,Have we done what we need to do to included as a supporting document in the official record?,89,,
366,0.97,2444.809,2447.711,I think that would be a useful thing to do is well.,89,,
367,0.97,2447.711,2456.32,Thank you.,89,,
368,0.97,2456.32,2460.057,"Councilmember Herbold, that might be a question for the clerk on how we Procedurally do that.",89,,
369,0.97,2460.057,2463.627,But I would be totally supportive of that.,89,,
370,0.97,2463.627,2471.735,"Madam clerk, I think there was a question deferred by the bills sponsor to you.",90,,
371,0.97,2471.735,2480.444,I'm going to ask that you have Council President Gonzalez to repeat the questions of the clerk may have Tuesday.,90,,
372,0.97,2480.444,2485.149,You are on mute.,90,,
373,0.97,2485.149,2496.527,We received 2:01 PM and updated framework that the provider crazy has sent to us.,91,,
374,0.97,2496.527,2509.74,And just wondering whether there's a way to included as a supporting document in the official record . It doesn't necessarily need to be an amendment at this point.,91,,
375,0.97,2509.74,2517.448,I think there is another discussion about Memorializing this framework through a resolution.,91,,
376,0.97,2517.448,2528.158,"But if we could at least ensure it is attached to the materials for today's meeting, I think that would be really useful.",91,,
377,0.97,2528.158,2532.897,Thank you for repeating the question.,92,,
378,0.97,2532.897,2548.712,"Yes, if Council would like to add the actual updated version of the framework to the record, we just need confirmation all Council members have received via Email and after the meeting we can add the updated version to the record supporting document.",92,,
379,0.97,2548.712,2555.619,Thank you.,93,,
380,0.97,2555.619,2567.031,Councilmember Lewis can you confirm for the clerk that the updated framework you are Referencing during this meeting has in fact been circulated to all Council members?,93,,
381,0.97,2567.031,2590.354,"Yes yes, I can confirm the document title shared principles and agreed framework for response to people living out of shelter 2020, 2021, was Emailed by Allison to the entire Council at 201 and I can see all of our Emails on it.",94,,
382,0.97,2590.354,2599.73,I can confirm that even Councilmember Juarez whose excuse to date received it as well.,94,,
383,0.97,2599.73,2600.531,Thank you.,95,,
384,0.97,2600.531,2608.772,"Madam clerk, does not suffice for the confirmation you need in order to attach this to the final record?",95,,
385,0.97,2608.772,2615.179,"Yes, this is information needed and supporting documents.",96,,
386,0.97,2615.179,2615.579,Inc.,96,,
387,0.97,2615.579,2616.48,Very much.,96,,
388,0.97,2616.48,2631.595,"Councilmember Lewis if someone in your office would be so kind as to forward the final document that was circulated to all Council members to the clerk, that would be helpful in order to update the record.",97,,
389,0.97,2631.595,2636.667,Thank you so much.,97,,
390,0.97,2636.667,2637.301,Councilmember Pedersen.,97,,

392,0.97,2641.372,2654.485,"Thank you Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Herbold, it sounds like deputy Mayor skill or and others were involved helping to crack this.",98,,
393,0.97,2654.485,2655.786,Thanks to them.,98,,
394,0.97,2655.786,2663.494,I am concerned about the shrinking of the city government team that has been involved with this effort.,98,,
395,0.97,2663.494,2669.733,Essentially it is going from I believe 14 Ftes down to eight Ftes approximately.,98,,
396,0.97,2669.733,2681.145,Many constituents have contacted our office to share their concerns about the rise of visible unauthorized Encampments.,98,,
397,0.97,2681.145,2689.653,We know the centers for disease control guidelines regarding social distancing and spacing requirements Incongruent shelter models presents a problem.,98,,
398,0.97,2689.653,2696.794,The city has acted to stand up shelters and provide hygiene and outreach.,98,,
399,0.97,2696.794,2701.799,"But I believe we need to have that role, that strong role of coordinating from the city government.",98,,
400,0.97,2701.799,2712.643,City government leadership on coordinating the outreach efforts.,98,,
401,0.97,2712.643,2716.08,I know we voted unanimously to remove the police Department as a standard part of the team.,98,,
402,0.97,2716.08,2719.349,I am glad to see this incorporated and incorporated as part of this for my eyes.,98,,
403,0.97,2719.349,2723.187,There are times when Spt will need to be involved.,98,,
404,0.97,2723.187,2725.689,I know firefighters are going to encampment's when they are fire hazards.,98,,
405,0.97,2725.689,2734.998,They want to have the police Department available in Claes something were to arise.,98,,
406,0.97,2734.998,2740.27,My chief concern throughout this discussion is making sure the city government has a strong coordination role.,98,,
407,0.97,2740.27,2751.215,Because ultimately the city and county governments are responsible for addressing the problems of public health and safety.,98,,
408,0.97,2751.215,2760.991,I am very much looking forward to the King County homelessness authority taking shape so we can coordinate our efforts regionally to tackle this problem.,98,,
409,0.97,2760.991,2780.244,"Even though I am concerned about the shrinking role of city government and they wish you were a larger role, we can value our Hsd employees and the role the and what they bring to the table and see about expanding their role in the future . Today I will support the current rise however.",98,,
410,0.97,2780.244,2785.149,Thank you.,98,,
411,0.97,2785.149,2789.62,Any other comments for my colleagues?,98,,

413,0.97,2790.487,2795.926,Thank you.,99,,
414,0.97,2795.926,2804.868,"Thanks to the folks who spoke today, especially those who articulated the urgency for us to get dollars out the door right now.",99,,
415,0.97,2804.868,2806.87,That is the reality of the situation we are in.,99,,
416,0.97,2806.87,2813.243,The outreach dollars we allocated were not given to community partners to help with outreach.,99,,
417,0.97,2813.243,2829.927,Instead of hoping folks in the community message is Council has not stepped in to provide an alternative.,99,,
418,0.97,2833.163,2836.967,"This is what the providers want, right now they are seeing lack of dollars being allocated to the community.",99,,
419,0.97,2836.967,2849.513,"People going without the outreach services they need, connections to housing, and essential support like a trash cleanup and making sure that people get the assistance they need to have food and Ideally referrals to the right place.",99,,
420,0.97,2849.513,2854.818,It's in the spirit that many Council members have brought up of us needing to get the money out the door.,99,,
421,0.97,2854.818,2857.487,And wanting to see the good work those community partners get funded.,99,,
422,0.97,2857.487,2885.716,I will be looking forward to voting for this and recognizing it was the principles from her earlier action and making sure the outreach is not being led or done in conduction with those who are sworn officers and that there is an appropriate role for an excellent city team to be coordinating behind the scenes to make sure they get the referrals they need and into hopefully case management.,99,,
423,0.97,2885.716,2892.823,That is an important role for city to continue to do but making sure community partners with trusted relationships are out there doing the hard work.,99,,
424,0.97,2892.823,2904.234,"Thank you to them for sending the framework and to all of us, I think this is a good indication of how we can continue to make sure the trusted partners are getting the dollars.",99,,
425,0.97,2904.234,2913.61,That is the most important thing is folks deal with Covid and the five year crisis of housing and homelessness afford ability issues.,99,,
426,0.97,2913.61,2914.978,With that I will be voting yes.,99,,
427,0.97,2914.978,2919.449,Thank you.,100,,
428,0.97,2919.449,2923.086,"Councilmember Mosqueda, any other comments?",100,,

431,0.97,2933.864,2936.199,I will be brief.,101,,
432,0.97,2936.199,2965.329,I understand were folks who have some skepticism about this legislation are coming from based on the history of the old navigation team . a lot of the issues we have seen over the last three years around collaboration between the city and provider community which I think we can all agree has not in and of itself been able to solve our homelessness crisis.,101,,
433,0.97,2965.329,2982.612,"And we see every day thousands of our neighbors living without basic necessities, without basic hygiene facilities and as Councilmember Lewis often says, in this bill is not going to solve all of that neatly.",101,,
434,0.97,2982.612,2990.32,But it is a step in the right direction to start this collaborative process of working through this with all of the principal operator in this area.,101,,
435,0.97,2990.32,3009.94,"I would note that while we are revising the pro Visa from the summer, only $245,000 is going back to the human services Department.",101,,
436,0.97,3009.94,3029.292,"$245,000, the last two months of the year and over $2 million is going to be released to service providers also based on revisions of what that many can be going to based on collaboration and conversation providers and what they really need based on what they are experiencing now in the field.",101,,
437,0.97,3029.292,3031.328,That includes more money for behavioral mental health services.,101,,
438,0.97,3031.328,3031.962,Flexible financial assistance.,101,,
439,0.97,3031.962,3034.364,Case management to expand existing case management contracts.,101,,
440,0.97,3034.364,3037.667,Housing navigation.,101,,
441,0.97,3037.667,3060.824,"As well as technology needs for service providers so, what we have a lot of work to do and this one thing is not going to solve all of it, this is an important step forward and a continuing to come together to really bring action and respond to what we are seeing in the city.",101,,
442,0.97,3060.824,3077.841,There were folks in public comments who were staying there in frustration about the city having been bogged down and really important visitors about the future direction of what are homeless's response is going to look like.,101,,
443,0.97,3077.841,3093.657,Is the first step to all of us realizing our common interest in this and moving forward in a way that can hopefully finally bridge the divide and get people the really critical resources they need and that this Council has appropriated money to address.,101,,
444,0.97,3093.657,3106.87,"With that, Madam President, I look forward to the vote and look forward to the next steps in working through this policy area.",101,,
445,0.97,3106.87,3108.004,Through the 2020 budget process.,101,,
