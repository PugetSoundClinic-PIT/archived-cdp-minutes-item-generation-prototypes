150,0.8190901875495911,865.3,867.8,"Okay, so if you'll go to the next slide,",,,
151,0.9128385782241821,869.2,869.9, please.,,,
152,0.9127382636070251,871.0,892.9, So also what we're looking at in addition to what how hot is it going to be and and for how long we're also looking at fire potential which of course then brings in the added concern about smoke and how that impacts those of us that live and work in Seattle and people that have to be in Saco outside.,,,
153,0.9127382636070251,893.4,900.3,"So last season, the smoke affecting Seattle came from fires in Pierce County.",,,
154,0.8137633800506592,900.9,904.9, Arne and Central Oregon and some as far away as Northern California.,,,
155,0.8137633800506592,905.2,912.3,"And as you can see on this map, there are also their significant Wildland fire potential this year as well.",,,
156,0.8137633800506592,912.3,913.7,So July and August.,,,
157,0.8137633800506592,913.7,915.5,Look pretty much the same.,,,
158,0.8137633800506592,915.6,925.4,A little a little more potential for fires in the month of August and these same areas that were had elevated risk.,,,
159,0.8137633800506592,925.4,929.6,"Last year, are again the areas that were looking at again, so smoke.",,,
160,0.8137633800506592,929.6,930.7,In addition to the high.,,,
161,0.8809087872505188,930.8,934.2, Apertures can be a factor.,,,
162,0.8809087872505188,934.2,940.1,"So for this weekend, there has not been a lot of fire related activity that we've heard about.",,,
163,0.8809087872505188,940.1,942.3,So mostly for this coming weekend.,,,
164,0.8809087872505188,942.3,945.3,We're worried about the high temperatures.,,,
165,0.8809087872505188,945.7,946.0,Okay.,,,
166,0.8809087872505188,946.0,947.3,Next side piece.,,,
167,0.8969694375991821,948.0,956.7," So in addition to monitoring the weather report and then in, including assessments on what the heat impacts are going to look like.",,,
168,0.8969694375991821,956.7,959.8,We have these coordination calls.,,,
169,0.8969694375991821,959.8,971.2,We the office of emergency management with a number of different departments in preparation to manage the consequences from the excessive Heat and the high temperatures.,,,
170,0.8969694375991821,971.2,976.6,And the initial coordination takes place using a series of conference calls.,,,
171,0.8969694375991821,976.6,977.8,"We are, in fact,",,,
172,0.8685691356658936,978.1,989.6, One tomorrow and we start with what is the National Weather Service saying that is going to happen and then also looking at what are their advisories?,,,
173,0.8685691356658936,989.6,1002.9,Whether it's a heat advisory and excessive heat watch or a heat warning and those are progressive in terms of how drastic they believe the impacts will be to to everyone who lives and works here.,,,
174,0.8685691356658936,1003.6,1007.9,We also there also could be a spike in heat-related illnesses that would also,,,
175,0.7863880395889282,1008.0,1012.1, So be a trigger for us and needing to have a call.,,,
176,0.7863880395889282,1012.3,1023.0,"And then also, as I mentioned before, like we're expecting this weekend, is hot days and not much cooling in the in the evening hours.",,,
177,0.7863880395889282,1023.0,1027.2,That is a significant concern.,,,
178,0.7863880395889282,1027.4,1037.4,"So, when we get together with all the Departments, we then not only do we look at what are the strategies for the Department's operationalizing their resources.",,,
179,0.7863880395889282,1037.7,1037.9,We,,,
180,0.8689232468605042,1038.1,1042.1, So look at how will we reach and support vulnerable populations.,,,
181,0.8689232468605042,1042.6,1050.6,We also look at do we need to modify any of the outdoor City operations that are currently underway and then a big push.,,,
182,0.8689232468605042,1050.6,1055.8,As you might imagine is for the coordination of public information.,,,
183,0.8689232468605042,1057.1,1065.7,So on the call that we're having tomorrow at 1 p.m. We'll start with the very latest of what the weather service is going to tell us.,,,
184,0.8689232468605042,1066.5,1067.6,And then we'll look.,,,
185,0.8602592349052429,1068.0,1073.4," At cooling center operations, which departments are planning to open.",,,
186,0.8602592349052429,1073.4,1074.6,Will there be any?,,,
187,0.8602592349052429,1075.9,1079.6,"For example, my library locations, be open?",,,
188,0.8602592349052429,1079.9,1082.4,"If so, what are the hours of operation?",,,
189,0.8602592349052429,1082.4,1084.9,Do they have cooling systems there?,,,
190,0.8602592349052429,1085.6,1088.5,And how can we open additional ones if needed?,,,
191,0.8602592349052429,1088.5,1093.5,We'll also look at engaging vulnerable populations.,,,
192,0.8602592349052429,1093.8,1097.9,"So not only people experiencing homelessness, but also are there.",,,
193,0.9008157849311829,1098.0,1106.1, Elderly folks that need to get the messaging about protection things that they might do so that they're not.,,,
194,0.9008157849311829,1106.1,1109.8,So susceptible to the high heat.,,,
195,0.9008157849311829,1110.3,1127.4,So those departments that I mentioned 18 to 19 of them will also look at or they adjusting any of their operational plans doing due to the high temperatures and how does that impact either roadways or closures?,,,
196,0.8494245409965515,1128.4,1135.6, What are their resources that they could commit to managing hot weather services?,,,
197,0.8494245409965515,1135.6,1139.3,So are they going to need overtime extra people to help with that?,,,
198,0.8494245409965515,1139.5,1147.5,And then do they as individual departments to have any any outstanding items that they want us to be aware of?,,,
199,0.8494245409965515,1148.3,1153.2,So in the event that additional resources need to be called in.,,,
200,0.8494245409965515,1153.2,1157.8,We also have relationships with our neighboring Partners both.,,,
201,0.7639253735542297,1158.0,1159.6, County and the state.,,,
202,0.7639253735542297,1160.1,1173.0,"It's unlikely for heat that we would need additional resources, but we will get information from the county in particular about also cooling centers or other places that they may have opened.",,,
203,0.7639253735542297,1173.0,1180.7,That would also help if people need to move during the weekend or during any heat event.,,,
204,0.7639253735542297,1180.7,1184.0,So it wouldn't just be cooling centers that are managed by us.,,,
205,0.7639253735542297,1184.3,1186.7,But also ones that the county has,,,
206,0.8054548501968384,1189.6,1194.4," Okay, so I believe that's the last slide.",,,
207,0.8885368704795837,1196.3,1205.7, So if you have any specific questions about what I said or anything else related to excessive feedom.,,,
208,0.8885368704795837,1205.8,1209.1,Hopefully I can provide some clarification or answers.,,,
209,0.9128383994102478,1212.3,1213.1," Yes, thank you.",,,
210,0.9128383994102478,1213.1,1213.6,I'm director.,,,
211,0.9128383994102478,1213.6,1215.1,Mayor for that overview.,,,
212,0.9128383994102478,1215.3,1219.3,Can I ask my colleagues before I jump into some of my questions?,,,
213,0.9128383994102478,1219.6,1225.0,Does anyone here want to jump in first?,,,
214,0.9128383994102478,1225.0,1227.4,I'm not really seeing anybody on the current panel.,,,
215,0.8371632099151611,1229.0,1231.4," Captain Strauss, did you know?",,,
216,0.8371632099151611,1231.4,1232.4,"Okay, great.",,,
217,0.8371632099151611,1233.2,1236.6,"So direct premiered, it just to maybe talk about us.",,,
218,0.8371632099151611,1236.6,1253.3,"It looks like we're going into potentially several days in a row of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, heat potentially for the first time in the history of the city due to me in again, to Global Climate Change.",,,
219,0.8371632099151611,1253.3,1257.4,Could we potentially get,,,
220,0.8903085589408875,1258.3,1263.0," maybe a little bit of the, real mechanical overview of",,,
221,0.7742053866386414,1265.4,1286.8," House, how the office will make a decision, potentially based on the impact of consecutive days of extreme heat, that will trigger the opening of some of these Emergency Shelters that the human services department has put aside and I will separately site from the memo that test call.",,,
222,0.7742053866386414,1286.8,1294.9,"We provided us to talk about the capacity of those facilities, but, but I do want to just go a little bit more over the function that OEM",,,
223,0.9128382802009583,1295.1,1306.1," Plays, you know similar like on the inverse right to when we have snow days, the decisions that are made by OEM that sort of trigger the, the utilization of that shelter resource.",,,
224,0.9128382802009583,1307.0,1312.4,And then just just talk about that a little bit more because I think that's a big area of public interest.,,,
225,0.9128382205963135,1314.1,1327.1," Of course, so the decision to open cooling centers or other places for people to get some Refuge from the heat is not made by the office of emergency management.",,,
226,0.9128382205963135,1327.1,1334.6,It's collectively by the Departments that are on the call in coordination with the mayor's office.,,,
227,0.9128382205963135,1335.6,1342.5,And obviously this weekend like you mentioned is unprecedented heat and more than we've had.,,,
228,0.7754189372062683,1343.9,1348.8," Year-to-date, but but that's not a decision and also with public health.",,,
229,0.7754189372062683,1348.8,1354.3,"So public health is always also, you know, cancer is one of those departments that will be weighing in.",,,
230,0.7754189372062683,1356.1,1359.1,So it's a collective decision.,,,
231,0.7754189372062683,1359.5,1365.1,And my operations coordinator can is also here on the call.,,,
232,0.7754189372062683,1366.0,1370.6,"So can if you have anything else to add to that, please feel free to jump in.",,,
233,0.8642960786819458,1371.5,1387.1," I'll just say we bring together, the experts who best understand these populations along with public health and then looking at all the information that's how we come to a decision about opening up cooling show centers.",,,
234,0.8642960786819458,1387.1,1390.7,And where those cooling centers need to be established.,,,
235,0.8642960786819458,1390.7,1393.8,So that is actually ongoing even as we speak.,,,
236,0.8642960786819458,1393.9,1401.1,"And yeah, we are in the advanced stages of setting up those capabilities in play and have those",,,
237,0.8640740513801575,1401.3,1403.3," Oh, capabilities in place for this weekend.",,,
238,0.8127875924110413,1405.9,1420.7," Yeah, so maybe if you're involved in those conversations, maybe I'll dovetail sort of reporting out the memo from deputy director, Colby at hsd with maybe some follow-up questions.",,,
239,0.8127875924110413,1420.7,1424.1,If you're aware operationally of how that process is going.,,,
240,0.8127875924110413,1424.8,1428.4,Because the information that has been provided to the committee.,,,
241,0.8488897681236267,1429.8,1435.7," In the attached, memo indicates that there are two shelter locations.",,,
242,0.8488897681236267,1435.7,1442.7,"This is specifically for a smoke event, a wildfire, smoke event, but I imagine and correct me if I'm wrong.",,,
243,0.8488897681236267,1442.7,1445.5,They could also be utilized for a severe heat.,,,
244,0.8488897681236267,1445.5,1448.5,A Spate of severe heat event as well.,,,
245,0.8488897681236267,1449.4,1458.9,"And that would be Fisher to Pavilion and exhibition Hall on the Scandal Center campus, that these locations were picked in collaboration with King County.",,,
246,0.8384521007537842,1459.2,1488.8," Seattle Department of Public Health as well as you know with the office of emergency management and that they have the capacity at those facilities through the air filtration systems that are necessary to comply with smoke and and the conflation of the respiratory challenges, smoke poses with, you know, still being in a covid-19 environment that in total, those shelters have a capacity to serve up to 230.",,,
247,0.8065347671508789,1489.0,1498.5, 30 individuals combined the way that they're currently constituted and that's between Fisher pavillion and exhibition Hall on the Seattle Center campus.,,,
248,0.8065347671508789,1499.2,1518.9,"The human services department did also in the, in the letter indicate that one of the big differences from last summer is the city has added almost 400 additional spaces through the hoteling program with the kings in and the Executive Hotel Pacific.",,,
249,0.8075262308120728,1520.5,1527.2, The city's entire shelter system stands at 2463 shelter spaces.,,,
250,0.8075262308120728,1528.3,1538.5,So there is also a reduced footprint of the number of folks that will need to get inside versus where we were last summer when we did not have this 400 ischl spaces.,,,
251,0.8075262308120728,1539.3,1548.8,"So that is an important piece of context from The Memo from the human services department, but I guess going back to the 230 spaces that that",,,
252,0.9127423167228699,1548.9,1563.0," I'll be opened by a determination by the various executive departments that there is a, you know, either a smoke emergency or an extreme heat, emergency, maybe just some conversation.",,,
253,0.9127423167228699,1563.0,1569.5,"And in what, the office of emergency Management's role has been and recommending where and how those be stood up and placed.",,,
254,0.9127423167228699,1569.5,1578.0,"And, and if there are some potential cooling assets in addition to the 230 spaces that might be outside of the four corners of this memo.",,,
255,0.8062755465507507,1580.7,1586.9," So, the, the role of the office of emergency management is to make.",,,
256,0.8062755465507507,1587.8,1593.9,"So, for set out what, we believe the consequences for various hazards are including heat.",,,
257,0.8062755465507507,1594.0,1596.6,So the consequences are this?,,,
258,0.8062755465507507,1597.0,1602.3,This is how we believe this may impact the population.,,,
259,0.8062755465507507,1602.9,1605.8,And those are set forth in that coordination call.,,,
260,0.8062755465507507,1605.8,1609.0,Then we have a conversation with the experts and all those different areas.,,,
261,0.8576208353042603,1609.2,1612.4, Is so hsd Parks.,,,
262,0.8576208353042603,1612.4,1618.7,Everyone else would then confer and decide on locations and whatnot at that time.,,,
263,0.8576208353042603,1619.1,1624.3,It's that's why we have all those experts on the phone and have that.,,,
264,0.8576208353042603,1624.3,1630.3,So our role is really about identification of Hazards and consequences.,,,
265,0.9035747051239014,1635.7,1640.9," Hey, can do you have anything to add to that or rest on director, mayor's response.",,,
266,0.9035747051239014,1642.0,1643.6,I'll go ahead rest on her response.,,,
267,0.9035747051239014,1644.2,1644.8,Very good.,,,
268,0.9035747051239014,1644.8,1645.7,Excellent.,,,
269,0.9035747051239014,1647.4,1649.8,"Good employee over there, the office of emergency management.",,,
270,0.9035747051239014,1651.0,1660.1,"Well, look, I really appreciate the presentation and the transparency in how these decisions are going to be made.",,,
271,0.9035747051239014,1660.1,1665.3,And that we do have the office of emergency management here to assess the risks associated with these.,,,
272,0.9128382205963135,1665.5,1680.4, Coming stretches of heat and and knowing unfortunately with a fair degree of certainty that there is is going to be a smoke event at some point over the summer based on the charts that you showed earlier.,,,
273,0.9128382205963135,1682.3,1686.9,"You know, I appreciate that.",,,
274,0.9128382205963135,1686.9,1690.3,The human services department sent along this.,,,
275,0.9128382205963135,1690.8,1694.5,This memo that the public and council members can review.,,,
276,0.9128382205963135,1694.6,1695.3,"Certainly, there will be",,,
277,0.8369399309158325,1695.4,1696.4, A follow-up questions.,,,
278,0.8369399309158325,1696.4,1701.4,And this topic by by no means is exhausted by this.,,,
279,0.8369399309158325,1701.4,1704.4,Check in today with this panel.,,,
280,0.8369399309158325,1704.5,1705.4,Certainly.,,,
281,0.8369399309158325,1705.7,1725.3,"There will be follow-up questions for human services department at our July meeting and there might have been at that point b a b a post operation report if there is a stand up this weekend of special resources and cooling resources, given the anticipation of the way.",,,
282,0.7646084427833557,1725.5,1729.5," They're so, you know, I want to open it back up to colleagues.",,,
283,0.7646084427833557,1729.5,1735.3,If anyone has any questions or comments for the office of Emergency Management.,,,
284,0.7634513974189758,1737.5,1738.4," Yes, councilmember straps.",,,
285,0.7634513974189758,1738.9,1746.7,I think each area it is with it is a two-sided coin when the office of emergency management gets involved.,,,
286,0.7634513974189758,1746.7,1751.7,It means that we're in an emergency or in a situation that requires greater attention.,,,
287,0.7634513974189758,1752.0,1754.4,"So with that, it always makes me nervous.",,,
288,0.7634513974189758,1754.4,1764.4,"On the other hand, when I know that the office of emergency management is operating on a topic that we have all of the resources of the city laser focused on the solution.",,,
289,0.7634513974189758,1764.4,1767.1,"I know under the past mayor, we had the opposite.",,,
290,0.8018720746040344,1767.3,1771.6, Urgency Management Open to address the homelessness crisis on a daily basis.,,,
291,0.8018720746040344,1772.0,1774.5,That's I'm not necessarily proposing that here today.,,,
292,0.8018720746040344,1774.5,1775.3,I'm just saying that.,,,
293,0.8018720746040344,1775.3,1778.9,I know when we have all of the decision-makers in the same room.,,,
294,0.8018720746040344,1778.9,1783.9,We are able to operate at a speed that is faster than when we are all working in our silos.,,,
295,0.8018720746040344,1783.9,1788.7,"So with that director mayor, I'm excited that you are all hands on deck.",,,
296,0.8018720746040344,1788.7,1793.1,"I just highlight the fact that in the past, whether it's cold weather or hot weather shelters.",,,
297,0.8018720746040344,1793.4,1797.1,The issue that we run into most often is just getting them Lon.,,,
298,0.8512263894081116,1797.2,1802.8," Launched in a timely manner, it almost seems as if they should be launched already today in anticipation.",,,
299,0.8512263894081116,1803.2,1809.3,And I know that that's not the office of emergency management director decision today.,,,
300,0.8512263894081116,1809.4,1814.3,So just highlighting day and said that it is also the Department's discretion.,,,
301,0.8512263894081116,1815.1,1821.5,"So I guess also calling out, you know, if there's ever anything that you need over this weekend director mayor or your team.",,,
302,0.8512263894081116,1821.6,1825.4,I know that councilmember Lewis will be happy to take the call and I will as well.,,,
303,0.8512263894081116,1825.4,1827.1,Just let us know what we can do to help you out.,,,
304,0.793707013130188,1828.6,1830.4," Yeah, I really appreciate that.",,,
305,0.793707013130188,1830.4,1833.7,"And I know some people are, are I love that.",,,
306,0.793707013130188,1833.7,1838.4,"You said well if the emergence of a sudden emergency Management's involved, there's an emergency.",,,
307,0.793707013130188,1839.0,1841.7,"So, my little caveat to that would be.",,,
308,0.793707013130188,1841.7,1850.3,"Actually, we're paying attention all the time so that there isn't an emergency that that surprises us.",,,
309,0.793707013130188,1850.8,1857.9,So we do a lot of preparation all the time and think of the worst case thing that could possibly happen.,,,
310,0.793707013130188,1858.1,1858.2,"So,",,,
311,0.9088872671127319,1858.4,1860.4, The rest of you don't have to think about that.,,,
312,0.9088872671127319,1860.7,1864.9,So so just just feel better about that.,,,
313,0.9088872671127319,1864.9,1867.9,"And also it really is a, you know, a collective thing.",,,
314,0.9088872671127319,1867.9,1871.0,That's why we have the expertise of all the different departments.,,,
315,0.9088872671127319,1871.0,1875.6,That's also a really good thing that you don't just have one group that's deciding for everybody.,,,
316,0.9088872671127319,1876.5,1888.3,"And, you know, it's really as, you know, we have the representable has a reputation for and I'm here to as a fairly new person here, to say, it's definitely true that the city",,,
317,0.8927251696586609,1888.4,1897.3," He really does care about just like, you know, based on what what you all are talking about care about, making sure that people are cared for.",,,
318,0.8927251696586609,1897.4,1900.9,So part of our job though is to think about that.,,,
319,0.8927251696586609,1900.9,1903.6,Worst case and then hope that's not where we go.,,,
320,0.8927251696586609,1905.7,1906.2,"Well said,",,,
321,0.896922767162323,1908.1,1912.1," Okay, any final comments or questions for the panel here, before?",,,

349,0.8361592888832092,2011.9,2021.3,So this this bill has come up through the initiative that my office has been pursuing that we've dubbed.,,,
350,0.8361592888832092,2021.3,2025.7,It takes a village to try to secure public private.,,,
351,0.8951571583747864,2025.9,2028.9, Two ships to potentially stretch and scale further.,,,
352,0.8951571583747864,2029.3,2042.3,"The public investment in tiny house, Village villages, with matching support for private parties, who approached my office with an interest in investing in those kinds of undertakings.",,,
353,0.8951571583747864,2043.2,2055.7,"This is something that historically has been done in tiny houses, Villages, tiny house Villages typically involve a lot of Sweat Equity and putting them together, you know.",,,
354,0.9053395986557007,2055.9,2067.8," A lot of volunteers coming together to build the houses and also typically involve a lot of matching philanthropy to buy the underlying tiny houses, since tiny houses in, and I'm the in and of themselves are not very expensive.",,,
355,0.9053395986557007,2068.9,2084.5,"What the city has not had is sort of an independent account that can Aggregate and collect some of these contributions so that we can then, and we can then better fold them into the city's competitive.",,,

357,0.7691025733947754,2085.9,2092.3, Other processes to make sure that we are being effective stewards of that money and treating that money the same way.,,,
358,0.7691025733947754,2092.3,2103.9,"We would treat taxpayer money in terms of making sure it goes through an RFQ, making sure it goes and gets out through competitive bidding and it's not necessarily dependent on any one particular provider.",,,
359,0.7691025733947754,2104.5,2112.6,So hence this ordinance that's before us and we have Jeff Sims here to go over and talk a little bit more about it.,,,
360,0.7691025733947754,2112.6,2115.6,But like I said today is just a briefing and not,,,
361,0.8955299854278564,2115.8,2118.5, Not anticipated to have any vote on it today.,,,
362,0.8955299854278564,2119.0,2128.7,I know that there are some potential technical amendments that the city budget office is likely going to seek.,,,
363,0.8955299854278564,2128.7,2137.4,"And, and I look forward to working with the CBO on putting that together to accommodate some of their concerns around administrability.",,,
364,0.8955299854278564,2137.4,2145.8,"But for now, I think I'll hand it over to Jeff so we can start jumping into this and, and then open it up.",,,
365,0.8649946451187134,2145.9,2147.4, For a little bit more of a conversation.,,,

376,0.8649946451187134,2172.9,2175.6,"In fact, many of those sections of it were actually copied from",,,
377,0.886158287525177,2175.8,2177.6, Bill and it has been reviewed by law.,,,
378,0.886158287525177,2177.6,2186.3,So that ordinance 1 1976 three was that was acted on last year Anna and the resulting fund from that model ordinance has been operating for about a year now.,,,
379,0.886158287525177,2186.6,2188.7,Nevertheless is the as the chair noted.,,,

382,0.886158287525177,2198.7,2202.8,I'm just make it easier to operationally carry out the intention of the legislation.,,,
383,0.886158287525177,2203.0,2204.9,Ultimately this this,,,
384,0.8947228789329529,2206.1,2225.8," Legislation would create a fund that as described in the fund would provide homelessness and Human Services and preventative primary mental and Behavioral Health Care that is highly similar to The Domain of services and the type of fund that is discussed in proposed Charter amendment number 29, which has been filed with the city clerk.",,,

388,0.8947228789329529,2229.7,2235.6,Now one thing that I am working with law and CBO to determine is our ability to receive donations.,,,
389,0.7496883273124695,2235.9,2251.1," Dida to that fund or other funds and the level of accounting that would be necessary that would be possible to ensure the use of those funds on the purposes as prescribed in this legislation, which are rather brought on the, there's a long list of them there.",,,
390,0.7496883273124695,2251.2,2255.8,"But as I said, it's generally to cover, homelessness Human Services and a large range of healthcare services.",,,

396,0.8701342344284058,2302.7,2306.4,We're seeing nationally in the United States regarding homelessness.,,,
397,0.8243044018745422,2307.8,2310.3, This is certainly not going to be an effort that's going to lead.,,,

402,0.8703345656394958,2364.4,2366.7,That's going to come from things like the JumpStart.,,,
403,0.9032328128814697,2367.7,2372.8, Tax that we passed under councilmember mosquitoes leadership last year.,,,
404,0.9032328128814697,2373.3,2382.9,"So, you know, with that though, I do think that when people come in aachen and want to help, it is our role as Leaders to facilitate a way to accommodate.",,,

423,0.912838876247406,2453.9,2456.3,The city would have to enter into to accept the funds.,,,
424,0.8789712190628052,2457.3,2471.4," and if the title references donations gifts and grants, I'm wondering if it is intended solely to receive donations or if they're if something like for example, low interest loans is also",,,
