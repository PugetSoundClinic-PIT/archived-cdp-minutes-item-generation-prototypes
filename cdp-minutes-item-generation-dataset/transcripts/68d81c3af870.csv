168,0.97,763.295,771.07,I am concerned about the proposed Rfp process and the unnecessary precedence it sets.,30,,
169,0.97,771.07,781.981,It's designed to be a process that ensures rate payers have a say in who manages the funds to obtain services.,30,,
170,0.97,781.981,798.764,"During the process, over 66% of the rate payers in the District signed a petition that the Asessionments continue for 12 years and the partnership is the manager of the funds.",30,,
171,0.97,798.764,803.402,Please in adding an additional Rfp would deny the will of the rate pay herbs.,30,,
172,0.97,803.402,808.774,Support the will of the rate payers by passing the ordinance as presented.,30,,
173,0.97,808.908,811.51,Thank you.,31,,

179,0.97,833.332,840.139,Provided support to me as the business owner certainly through the Covid-19 crisis.,32,,
180,0.97,840.139,855.554,"Even before that in networking programs, the clean and safe program, and the focus on keeping businesses alive, small businesses alive, which is already difficult, but even exaggerated with the Covid-19.",32,,
181,0.97,855.554,860.059,I totally support the longer term renewal of 12 years plus.,32,,
182,0.97,860.059,866.899,And it takes time to build relationships and to get the good work they're doing going.,32,,
183,0.97,866.899,869.735,So Rfp of less than five years doesn't make any sense.,32,,

438,0.97,2087.885,2094.292,"Most times, I find a win, win when it comes to community concerns that without a B.I.A.",74,,
439,0.97,2094.292,2099.764,Outreach worker in the U district normally amounts to a 911 call.,74,,
440,0.97,2099.764,2107.805,"If I'm addressing anywhere between two and five calls a week, I know my position is freeing up the 911 system.",74,,
441,0.97,2107.805,2116.08,"And most of the times, the social workers are addressing the concerning.",74,,
442,0.97,2116.08,2121.252,And we're helping them learn the ropes of the neighborhood and helps with resources.,74,,

448,0.97,2135.266,2137.335,Hi.,76,,

450,0.97,2148.846,2151.048,I am here to support the amendments.,76,,
451,0.97,2151.048,2156.954,"Despite what you're Maring from other speakers, there are important ways the current B.I.A.",76,,
452,0.97,2156.954,2163.027,Is not successful at restoring us to being an inviting retail shopping district.,76,,
453,0.97,2163.027,2167.665,This is the most critical factor for the businesses.,76,,
454,0.97,2167.665,2184.649,And yet we are still in shabby state and we need to conscious the fact that the UDF board has abolished the term limits and a third of the board is standing for re-election have terms that should have expired.,76,,
455,0.97,2184.649,2195.059,There's a case for the shiny new up zone favored by the core group of the board and will not support the livelihoods of many of the current retailers.,76,,
456,0.97,2195.059,2197.061,I support the new B.I.,76,,
457,0.97,2197.061,2203.467,A. only a successful one can turn things around through the markets and services.,76,,
458,0.97,2203.467,2209.407,We must recognize why the current Bia is partially failing.,76,,
459,0.97,2209.407,2209.674,Thank you.,76,,
460,0.97,2209.807,2210.208,"Thank you, Doug.",77,,
461,0.97,2210.208,2213.277,Okay.,77,,
462,0.97,2213.277,2217.615,I did not see any other speakers signed up.,77,,
463,0.97,2217.615,2221.619,So we will conclude the public comment portion of the hearing.,77,,
464,0.97,2221.619,2230.394,And move on to discussion of the U district B.I.A.,77,,
465,0.97,2230.394,2234.732,And the amendments we've been hearing about.,77,,
466,0.97,2234.732,2240.371,So we've got Yolanda to walk us through the amendments.,78,,
467,0.97,2240.371,2246.611,"And we do have, I believe, Phillip sip from O.A.",78,,
468,0.97,2246.611,2249.18,"D. and Yolanda, please introduce yourself and proceed.",78,,
469,0.97,2249.313,2252.016,Council central staff.,79,,
470,0.97,2252.016,2265.863,"So I will be walking through first, the substitute bill attached to the memo and describe the three amendments.",79,,
471,0.97,2265.863,2277.842,"As for the amendments, I will do a brief description and then give the floor to Council member Pedersen to speak to the amendment if that sounds good to you all.",79,,
472,0.97,2277.842,2278.576,Okay.,79,,
473,0.97,2278.576,2281.846,So the bill is a technical clarifying changes.,79,,
474,0.97,2281.846,2285.383,The intent was to clean up the legislation.,79,,
475,0.97,2285.383,2293.691,I'll NOTE some of the more notable changes were additional Council findings regarding the Covid-19 emergency recommended by the law Department.,79,,
476,0.97,2293.691,2302.867,We wanted to clarify some of the Termology used to calculate the assessment so it's clearer in the legislation.,79,,
477,0.97,2302.867,2318.315,And also change the responsibility for contracting with the program manager from the Department of finance and administrative services to the office of economic development as per our city policies that were adopted in 2016.,79,,
478,0.97,2318.315,2326.324,And consolidated the seats held by business tenants so there's a total of three seats for business tenants.,79,,
479,0.97,2326.324,2330.494,Two of which are tenants subject to a triple net lease.,79,,
480,0.97,2330.494,2335.933,So that's just a quick overview of the substitute bill.,79,,
481,0.97,2335.933,2342.506,"As for amendment one, this would reduce the duration of the U district B.I.A.",79,,
482,0.97,2342.506,2344.942,From 12 years to 10 years.,79,,
483,0.97,2345.242,2345.342,.,79,,
484,0.97,2350.781,2361.325,"Chair Morales, I can address the amounts at the end of Yolanda's presentation, if that's all right, to present them Wholistically.",80,,
485,0.97,2361.325,2361.692,That's fine.,81,,
486,0.97,2361.692,2361.892,Sure.,81,,
487,0.97,2361.892,2362.159,Go ahead.,81,,
488,0.97,2362.159,2362.393,Okay.,82,,
489,0.97,2362.393,2364.161,All right.,82,,
490,0.97,2364.161,2379.343,"So amendment two, there are two options kind of depending on whether amendment one, which Shortens the term of the B.I.A.",82,,
491,0.97,2379.343,2379.744,Is Developmented.,82,,
492,0.97,2379.744,2391.422,"If amount one is Developmented, consider amendment 2A to limit the contract term of the initial program manager which is district partnership to one year.",82,,
493,0.97,2391.422,2400.564,"The Office of economic development will conduct a process for the program manager, which would be for a five-year contract.",82,,
494,0.97,2400.564,2413.577,"Forward the end of the contract, they will run the process again to select the program manager for the four remaining years of the B.I.A.",82,,
495,0.97,2413.577,2423.154,Should it be Reauthorized the person SEB serving as the program manager at the time would be allowed to serve for a year.,82,,
496,0.97,2423.154,2427.324,"So two five-year terms, depending on if the B.I.A.",82,,
497,0.97,2427.324,2427.825,Is Reauthorized.,82,,
498,0.97,2427.825,2430.728,And this is if the B.I.A.,82,,
499,0.97,2430.728,2432.096,Is for ten years.,82,,
500,0.97,2432.096,2440.871,"So if amendment one is not adopted, the committee should then consider amendment 2B, program manager option two.",82,,
501,0.97,2440.871,2445.609,"Similar to option one, this would limit the contract term of the initial program manager to one year.",82,,
502,0.97,2445.609,2454.585,The subsequent program manager contract terms are adjusted to six years followed by five years.,82,,
503,0.97,2454.585,2461.725,"And again, the provision the organization serving as the program manager at the time of reauthorization would be allowed to serve as the interim program manager for one year.",82,,
504,0.97,2461.725,2469.166,"So in this case, we would have two six-year terms.",82,,
505,0.97,2469.166,2475.472,And amendment three would limit the number of seats held by University of Washington on the B.I.,82,,
506,0.97,2475.472,2484.014,"A. advisory board to 35% of the board or a maximum of five seats, whichever number is lower.",82,,
507,0.97,2484.014,2490.454,I will note the version of amendment three attached to the memo was incorrect.,82,,
508,0.97,2490.454,2509.34,"So there is a new version, a version two, that does not--so the amendment that was attached to my memo incorrectly adjusted the percentage of rate payers from 80% that held seats on the board from 80% to 75%.",82,,
509,0.97,2509.34,2510.808,That was incorrect.,82,,
510,0.97,2510.808,2513.21,It should only be the seats for University of Washington.,82,,
511,0.97,2513.21,2521.785,"So just as a note, the University of Washington currently holds five seats on the B.I.A .'s current board.",82,,
512,0.97,2521.785,2538.702,"Without this limit, the University could hold up to seven seats based on the 35% cap I discussed last week during our committee because of the other provisions of the board.",82,,
513,0.97,2538.702,2548.245,"So due to the fact that there would be a minimum of 20 seats on the board, Uw could have seven seats.",82,,
514,0.97,2548.245,2551.815,That is a quick walk through of the amendments.,82,,
515,0.97,2552.116,2553.751,.,82,,
516,0.97,2554.785,2555.185,"Thank you, Yolanda.",83,,
517,0.97,2555.185,2560.524,Okay.,83,,

521,0.97,2561.792,2565.629,And I want to take a step back for the audience.,84,,

523,0.97,2567.331,2636.333,I want to take a step back and provide Highi want to thank Thel businesses who took the time to speak today about the B.I.,84,,
524,0.97,2636.333,2650.08,"A. a study completed by Peter confirmed that 65%, nearly 2/3 of businesses along the main street of the ave owned by women and people of color.",84,,
525,0.97,2650.08,2658.355,I was happy to see the Durkan administration put forward the legislation with the scope that includes preventing displacement.,84,,
526,0.97,2658.355,2665.562,Preventing displacement is part of the economic development mission of this B. I.A.,84,,
527,0.97,2665.562,2669.9,If Reauthorized to go forward.,84,,
528,0.97,2669.9,2672.536,The U district is a very special place.,84,,

530,0.97,2674.805,2677.875,A light rail station is opening up.,84,,
531,0.97,2677.875,2684.715,"We have the most diverse, one of the most diverse best International selections of food in Seattle.",84,,
532,0.97,2684.715,2692.289,There's a lot of naturally occurring low income housing in the District along with rent restricted low income housing.,84,,
533,0.97,2692.289,2695.059,Many youth in the District experiencing homelessness.,84,,
534,0.97,2695.059,2696.927,There's a lot going on in the University district.,84,,
535,0.97,2696.927,2702.266,This is one of the reasons I'm a supporter of the business improvement area being Reauthorized.,84,,
536,0.97,2702.266,2709.773,Business improvement areas with positive tools that keep districts clean and safe throughout our city.,84,,

539,0.97,2716.313,2721.251,They have the reach program asking unsheltered and high barrier individuals.,84,,
540,0.97,2721.251,2722.486,"During the Covid crisis, the B.I.A.",84,,
541,0.97,2722.486,2727.091,Has been linking many of the small businesses to relief programs.,84,,
542,0.97,2727.091,2735.365,"And despite the benefits, there has been over the last five years a perceived imbalance of voices on the B.I.A.",84,,
543,0.97,2735.365,2737.0,Rate payer advisory board.,84,,
544,0.97,2737.0,2741.605,Particularly those small business owners that have triple net leases.,84,,
545,0.97,2741.605,2748.212,"That means they are paying the taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance.",84,,
546,0.97,2748.212,2750.581,It's passed through to the small business owner.,84,,
547,0.97,2750.581,2756.22,Many of the small businesses worked hard to advocate for their community inside and outside the B.I.,84,,
548,0.97,2756.22,2759.089,A. I wanted to make sure that B.I.A.,84,,
549,0.97,2759.089,2767.965,Honors some of these concerns that have been raised over the last five years.,84,,
550,0.97,2767.965,2772.569,We need good Governance and better representative in prevents displacement.,84,,
551,0.97,2772.569,2783.147,I was happy to see the legislation from Mayor Durkan had prevents displacement added to the mission.,84,,
552,0.97,2783.147,2789.319,Reinstituting term limits of the members of the Advisory board.,84,,
553,0.97,2789.319,2792.656,Adding representation of those triple net lease businesses.,84,,
554,0.97,2792.656,2797.661,And a requiring a competitive request for proposal process for the program manager.,84,,
555,0.97,2797.661,2802.9,The existing program manager for the B.I.A.,84,,
556,0.97,2802.9,2804.868,Is currently the University district partnership.,84,,
557,0.97,2804.868,2809.306,They have had this program manager contract for the last five years.,84,,
558,0.97,2809.306,2815.012,So it's essentially been a sole source contract to the U district partnership.,84,,
559,0.97,2815.012,2815.646,Let's talk about the amendments.,84,,
560,0.97,2815.646,2824.922,So the first--I support the substitute bill.,84,,
561,0.97,2824.922,2827.09,"Thank you, Yolanda, for explaining that.",84,,
562,0.97,2827.09,2829.326,It is primarily technical in nature.,84,,
563,0.97,2829.326,2834.631,The first amendment would alter the length of the B.I.A.,84,,
564,0.97,2834.631,2834.865,Term.,84,,
565,0.97,2834.865,2835.799,"Right now, it's five years.",84,,
566,0.97,2835.799,2838.702,So my amendment would take it to 12 years.,84,,
567,0.97,2838.702,2839.136,It would double it.,84,,
568,0.97,2839.136,2844.641,There is a lot of discussion today in the comments about we need long-term B.I.,84,,
569,0.97,2844.641,2847.945,A. so this would be accomplishing that.,84,,
570,0.97,2847.945,2851.215,"It's not the 12 years, but it's ten years.",84,,
571,0.97,2851.215,2854.017,It's doubling the length of the term.,84,,
572,0.97,2854.017,2858.956,We have heard concerns from some of the community that think the B.I.A.,84,,
573,0.97,2858.956,2862.759,Should not be renewed or the terms should be another five years.,84,,
574,0.97,2862.759,2865.596,I think that doubling it is more than reasonable.,84,,
575,0.97,2865.596,2874.972,The second amendment is about the Rfp.,84,,
576,0.97,2874.972,2884.948,So a lot of the talking points I heard from members at the public hearing were saying we need Rfp process every five years.,84,,
577,0.97,2884.948,2887.384,That's what these amendments are doing.,84,,
578,0.97,2887.384,2888.585,Five years and five years.,84,,
579,0.97,2888.585,2897.694,"However, we need to get started on the Rfp to actually have the office of economic development do a request for proposals.",84,,
580,0.97,2897.694,2902.299,"We have an expanded mission, which includes preventing displacement.",84,,
581,0.97,2902.299,2908.772,Preventing displacement is very important to me and I know other Council members as well.,84,,
582,0.97,2908.772,2920.217,So this is essentially Grandfathering in the University district partnership which will have the sole source contract for six years.,84,,
583,0.97,2920.217,2929.393,"The past five, plus another year, so the office of economic development can issue the Rfp.",84,,
584,0.97,2929.393,2931.328,And they can compete for that.,84,,
585,0.97,2931.328,2937.467,And then Whoever wins that will have that contract for the next five years.,84,,
586,0.97,2937.467,2938.068,They are five-year increments.,84,,
587,0.97,2938.068,2951.548,And it builds in the Grandfathering the next time we reauthorize ten to 12 years from now so that there is the continuity.,84,,
588,0.97,2951.548,2960.157,The last amendment is simply the University of Washington makes a voluntary contribution to the B.I.,84,,
589,0.97,2960.157,2968.332,A. and has a representation on the rate payer advisory board.,84,,
590,0.97,2968.332,2973.904,This amendment simply preserves the existing situation where they would continue to have their five seats on the board.,84,,
591,0.97,2973.904,2981.845,Which is significant representation from the University on this business district board.,84,,
592,0.97,2981.845,2985.816,And so they would continue to have that.,84,,
593,0.97,2985.816,2987.584,It just clarifies because the B.I.A.,84,,
594,0.97,2987.584,2996.493,"Board might grow, it clarifies it would be the lower of the 35% of the total for University of Washington or five members.",84,,
595,0.97,2996.493,3001.198,And happy to answer questioning about the amendments.,84,,
596,0.97,3001.198,3001.665,"Thank you, chair Morales.",84,,
597,0.97,3001.965,3002.933,.,84,,
598,0.97,3009.539,3011.408,"Madame chair, if I may.",85,,
599,0.97,3011.408,3011.808,"Yes, please.",86,,
600,0.97,3011.808,3019.082,"I'm hoping that--I don't know how you want me to do this, to tell you I have questions or concerns.",87,,
601,0.97,3019.082,3021.385,I don't want to interrupt you.,87,,
602,0.97,3021.385,3022.919,That's what I'm trying to say.,87,,
603,0.97,3022.919,3026.289,I will call on you now Council member Juarez.,88,,
604,0.97,3026.289,3026.623,Thank you.,89,,
605,0.97,3026.623,3033.33,"In the future, I'll text you like I do with the others and say I have a question so I can get in the Queue.",89,,
606,0.97,3033.463,3035.032,Okay.,90,,
607,0.97,3035.032,3044.307,"First of all, thank you Council member Pedersen in and the community that came out with the concerns.",91,,
608,0.97,3044.307,3054.751,"I took detailed notes at the hearing on May 20th about who is supporting, who wasn't, what the concerns were.",91,,
609,0.97,3054.751,3062.626,Thank you Council member Pedersen for paring down the core issues that weren't there and we've pared them down to the real issues.,91,,
610,0.97,3062.626,3075.872,"What I could gather from today of the over 25 people that spoke, I think we had three people, two of them business owners, that support all three amendments.",91,,
611,0.97,3075.872,3078.809,I understand that isn't reflective of everybody in the district.,91,,
612,0.97,3078.809,3084.981,I guess what my concern is I want to start off with it's clear everybody supports the renewal of the B.I.,91,,
613,0.97,3084.981,3091.321,"A. and where we have the rub, if you will, is the three amendments.",91,,
614,0.97,3091.321,3099.996,"And some of these amendments I can't support, at least at this juncture, until we learn more and we vote.",91,,
615,0.97,3099.996,3104.901,I don't see the purpose of--I'll start with the Rfp.,91,,
616,0.97,3104.901,3108.305,I'm old school.,91,,
617,0.97,3108.305,3109.206,"If it's not broke, don't fix it.",91,,
618,0.97,3109.206,3125.689,"And some people believe, I think they used the word shabby and some felt it didn't good Governance and the system doesn't work.",91,,
619,0.97,3125.689,3129.359,"What I know, I support intense local control.",91,,
620,0.97,3129.359,3137.334,I don't like another layer of Bureau SI.,91,,
621,0.97,3137.334,3148.445,"And please correct me if I'm wrong, I don't know of another one that has an overlay of the intervention of having an Rfp.",91,,
622,0.97,3148.445,3151.214,I don't see the purpose of it.,91,,
623,0.97,3151.214,3163.426,"And I want to thank, I think it was Phil who did the power point on the B.I.A.",91,,
624,0.97,3163.426,3166.229,And the history and what they provide.,91,,
625,0.97,3166.229,3177.541,"I don't see a need for incurring or adding another government, city, if you will, participation, when O.A.",91,,
626,0.97,3177.541,3186.583,D. has a staff person dedicated and they're working with community members on the issues that we heard last week and this week for the purpose of the B.I.,91,,
627,0.97,3186.583,3186.983,A.,91,,
628,0.97,3186.983,3192.756,"I can't support another level of government participation or intervention, if you will, for an Rfp.",91,,
629,0.97,3192.756,3193.49,I don't see the purpose of that.,91,,
630,0.97,3193.49,3201.765,And I don't have a position yet on limiting the board with the University of Washington.,91,,
631,0.97,3201.765,3210.84,I have some idea some of the numbers and the money they contribute whether it's five members or five seats or 35%.,91,,
632,0.97,3210.84,3216.513,I'll probably look to Council member Pedersen off line for more information.,91,,
633,0.97,3216.513,3230.727,"And the first amendment, the 12 to 10, going back to what I know formally as legal counsel as well why the purpose of having the B.I.A .'s, intense local control for people on the ground.",91,,
634,0.97,3230.727,3233.129,And I know the B.I.A.,91,,
635,0.97,3233.129,3235.632,For the University of Washington I believe has been around since 1996.,91,,
636,0.97,3235.632,3243.506,"And I know how much money, where the money goes, what they're doing with it.",91,,
637,0.97,3243.506,3254.784,"I know that at its core, some of the lowest B.I.A .'s started seven years and some to Perpetuity.",91,,
638,0.97,3254.784,3257.153,I don't the magic between 10 or 12.,91,,
639,0.97,3257.153,3264.594,I know you talked about what you've done is taken five and doubled it and you picked ten.,91,,
640,0.97,3264.594,3268.064,So I don't see the need for that.,91,,
641,0.97,3268.064,3271.101,I feel like it should stay where it's at and it's working.,91,,
642,0.97,3271.101,3284.648,I know you have a couple of business owners who stood up today and shared that they weren't happy with and have supported the amendment and feel that this organization isn't accountable.,91,,
643,0.97,3284.648,3288.718,I don't know if that's an audit or something different.,91,,
644,0.97,3288.718,3293.323,I don't want to Politicize the issue for three people or groups or businesses.,91,,
645,0.97,3293.323,3302.198,I know there's a lot of issues about Upzoning from the former Council and what we dealt with.,91,,
646,0.97,3302.198,3311.207,"I'm really skeptical of the tyranny of the minority, particularly if you have an institution standing since 1996 and is working.",91,,
647,0.97,3311.207,3317.58,"We have room for improvement, but I need to know where the flaws are.",91,,
648,0.97,3317.58,3319.049,Not just I'm not happy.,91,,
649,0.97,3319.049,3320.417,That's where I stand now.,91,,
650,0.97,3320.417,3325.922,I don't see myself supporting amendment one.,91,,
651,0.97,3325.922,3330.46,"I don't see myself supporting, let's see, the Rfp.",91,,
652,0.97,3330.46,3337.767,And I'm not sure where I'm at on the University of Washington board seat.,91,,
653,0.97,3337.767,3341.237,"And again, I can talk to Council member Pedersen off line.",91,,
654,0.97,3341.237,3344.407,Thank you for being open and sharing comments with me and your concerns.,91,,
655,0.97,3344.407,3348.344,And I look forward to working with you on this.,91,,
656,0.97,3348.344,3348.545,Thank you.,91,,
657,0.97,3348.845,3351.281,.,91,,
658,0.97,3351.581,3353.349,"Thank you, council member Juarez.",92,,
659,0.97,3353.349,3357.754,Council member Lewis has a question.,92,,
660,0.97,3357.754,3359.522,I would like just a little clarity.,92,,
661,0.97,3359.522,3365.662,I don't know if this is a question for Yolanda or Phillip.,92,,
662,0.97,3365.662,3374.771,But my understanding is that it is typically the Advisory board that manages the process of program manager contracting.,92,,
663,0.97,3374.771,3382.579,And this is the only program manager we have had for this B.I.,92,,
664,0.97,3382.579,3391.087,"A. in other situations if rate Payering are dissatisfied or want a different program manager, what is the process for them.",92,,
665,0.97,3391.087,3394.491,? and what would it mean for O.E.D.,92,,
666,0.97,3394.491,3395.892,To become responsible for the process?,92,,
667,0.97,3395.892,3406.636,And the reason I'm asking is because what I'm wondering subsequently is if sets a precedent for O.E.D.,92,,
668,0.97,3406.636,3410.106,Managing a similar process for other B.I.A.S.,92,,
669,0.97,3410.106,3410.473,Sure thing.,93,,
670,0.97,3410.473,3413.643,Can you guys hear me.,93,,
671,0.97,3413.643,3413.977,Yes.,94,,
672,0.97,3413.977,3414.244,Great.,95,,
673,0.97,3414.244,3417.747,To answer the first part of the question.,95,,
674,0.97,3417.747,3425.855,"I cited in the policies the rate payer advisory board is required to hold an annual rate payers meeting, a public meeting.",95,,
675,0.97,3425.855,3435.632,"They are obligated to vote on the work plan and the budget for the following year, along with the status and recommendation of the program manager.",95,,
676,0.97,3435.632,3445.442,Those three elements are voted upon by the rate payers and that serves as a recommendation to the city to enter into the contract with the program manager identified.,95,,
677,0.97,3445.442,3454.284,So that process happens annually for all the B.I.A .'s in Seattle.,95,,
678,0.97,3454.284,3454.517,Okay.,96,,
679,0.97,3454.517,3462.959,"And so there is already a process, but it is not managed, you know, there's not an Rfp issued by O.E.D.",96,,
680,0.97,3462.959,3467.931,"To manage the process, it's handled by the board?",96,,
681,0.97,3467.931,3468.731,That's correct.,97,,
682,0.97,3468.731,3469.632,And O.E.D.,97,,
683,0.97,3469.632,3469.899,And F.A.,97,,
684,0.97,3469.899,3480.143,S. serves as providing oversight and we attend the public meetings to tally the votes and hear public comments.,97,,
685,0.97,3480.143,3487.851,At that time we come back and agree or disagree to enter into the agreement.,97,,
686,0.97,3487.851,3489.352,.,97,,
687,0.97,3489.352,3489.686,Thank you.,98,,
688,0.97,3489.686,3490.153,Council member Lewis?,98,,
689,0.97,3490.286,3493.756,Thank you so much Madame chair.,99,,
690,0.97,3493.756,3511.474,"So, you know, I wanted to say generally here that the University district while it's not in district seven is the community I am extremely familiar with as a former under grad at the University of Washington.",99,,
691,0.97,3511.474,3515.378,I patronized many of the businesses and continue to.,99,,
692,0.97,3515.378,3541.204,"It's a very unique and dynamic business district that is facing a lot of the challenges that a lot of the business districts around the city are seeing in terms of the displacement of small businesses in terms of challenges around crime, challenges around just the general kind of Cleanliness of the neighborhood, which is a critical service the B.I.A.",99,,
693,0.97,3541.204,3541.471,Provided.,99,,
694,0.97,3541.471,3552.916,I want to really critically engage on these amendments that Council member Pedersen has brought forward.,99,,
695,0.97,3552.916,3556.252,We need a conversation in making sure in constituting a new B.I.A.,99,,
696,0.97,3556.252,3566.095,We are carving out the space for the voices of the Leaseholders and some of the other legacy businesses on the ave.,99,,
697,0.97,3566.095,3569.532,These businesses may not be there in a decade or in even five years.,99,,
698,0.97,3569.532,3575.371,And we need to make sure even though the B.I.A.,99,,
699,0.97,3575.371,3586.182,"Is not a be all, end all, to prevent displacement and preserve the character of the business district, there are mechanisms the B.I.A.",99,,
700,0.97,3586.182,3590.42,Can use and do to enhance the common values all of us hold.,99,,
701,0.97,3590.42,3615.678,"I guess what I'm signalling right now is I don't know exactly where the goal posts are going to be set, but I'll keep an open mind and I want to work with Council member Pedersen now that the amendments are out there over the course of the next week and beyond to really make sure that we're building something together that is going to advance our values and also respect, protect, and expand the services that the B.I.A.",99,,
702,0.97,3615.678,3616.512,Has already been providing.,99,,
703,0.97,3616.512,3620.483,And I think that we can do that by all coming together.,99,,
704,0.97,3620.483,3629.325,"And you know, I respect Council member Pedersen's leadership on this and the issues he has put on the table and forced this Committee and the community to take up and discuss.",99,,
705,0.97,3629.325,3634.063,And I think it's an overdue conversation and a welcome one.,99,,
706,0.97,3634.063,3643.239,I'm signalling my intent to keep an open mind and continue to work with you on this over the next week or so and see what we can come up with as a committee.,99,,
707,0.97,3643.373,3648.144,"Thank you, council member Lewis.",100,,
708,0.97,3648.144,3650.813,"Council member Pedersen, do you want to respond?",100,,
709,0.97,3650.813,3652.815,Thank you.,101,,
710,0.97,3652.815,3653.716,Thank you colleagues for that input.,101,,
711,0.97,3653.716,3672.368,"You know, having--as the representative of district four, when I was an aide, I worked on one of the prior renewals of the B.I.",101,,
712,0.97,3672.368,3674.871,A. and it was very small originally.,101,,
713,0.97,3674.871,3678.775,It was just part of the ave and that is it.,101,,
714,0.97,3678.775,3679.976,Now the B.I.A.,101,,
715,0.97,3679.976,3683.179,Is almost all of the University district.,101,,
716,0.97,3683.179,3684.947,It's a $1 million annual budget.,101,,
717,0.97,3684.947,3710.44,"So I think it deserves to have--and with the expansion of the mission to prevent economic displacement, I think that's it's beneficial for everybody to have a process where the program manager is having to be chosen among rather than just a sole source contract for the Rfp.",101,,
718,0.97,3710.44,3717.313,"In terms of, you know, the Rfp process is already in the Mayor's legislation.",101,,
719,0.97,3717.313,3720.516,So there was support from the executive.,101,,
720,0.97,3720.516,3725.388,"You know, I don't know what the magic is to the 12 years.",101,,
721,0.97,3725.388,3732.795,I don't know where that came from.,101,,
722,0.97,3732.795,3733.429,That's completely unique.,101,,
723,0.97,3733.429,3736.432,Doubling it seems reasonable to ten years.,101,,
724,0.97,3736.432,3743.806,I look forward to hearing more from my colleagues if they have more data on what's going on in district four.,101,,
725,0.97,3743.806,3751.08,I would love to hear that.,101,,
726,0.97,3751.08,3754.15,A lot of the speakers--they are on the Advisory board already.,101,,
727,0.97,3754.15,3761.691,"I want to be clear it's hard for people to call in, you know, at 9:30 in the morning.",101,,
728,0.97,3761.691,3764.76,"They're running their businesses right now, most of them.",101,,
729,0.97,3764.76,3770.166,So I do hope that there's some understanding that I do understand my district.,101,,
730,0.97,3770.166,3779.842,I understand what the needs are there in terms of what the process could be that's reasonable.,101,,
731,0.97,3779.842,3792.588,"And I think again, with the economic development mission being expanded to Predisplacement, that's what we want to focus on and make sure the organizations are poised to do that.",101,,
732,0.97,3792.588,3793.723,I think that's a healthy process.,101,,
733,0.97,3793.723,3797.593,I appreciate the comments and look forward to talking more about it.,101,,
734,0.97,3797.727,3801.33,"Thank you, council member Lewis.",102,,
735,0.97,3801.33,3816.879,"Colleagues, are there any other questions or comments for Council member Pedersen or for the Presenters?",102,,
736,0.97,3816.879,3817.113,Yes.,103,,
737,0.97,3817.113,3817.446,Go ahead.,104,,
738,0.97,3817.446,3821.15,My question is for Council member Pedersen.,105,,
739,0.97,3821.15,3821.651,"And again, thank you.",105,,
740,0.97,3821.651,3826.255,I understand how passionate you are about representing your district.,105,,
741,0.97,3826.255,3828.858,"From district five to District four, I get it.",105,,
742,0.97,3828.858,3831.327,Let me ask you and just be candid.,105,,
743,0.97,3831.327,3839.135,I don't want to go on and on about whether or not I'm a Husky.,105,,
744,0.97,3839.135,3840.369,I'm not.,105,,
745,0.97,3840.369,3843.773,Let me ask you this.,105,,
746,0.97,3843.773,3861.023,"Explain to me why you phrase this or talk about this being if it's even Nefarious to some degree, and correct me if I'm wrong, from my notes and my research, about this being a sole source contract.",105,,
747,0.97,3861.023,3875.204,"Tell me what that concern is Besides obviously there's the obvious connotation, only one person is getting the contract all the time and that's bad Governance and not representing everybody.",105,,
748,0.97,3875.204,3879.275,Can you expand on this particular concern that you have?,105,,
749,0.97,3879.275,3888.184,And I understand that it is a million dollar budget and we are looking at the economic displacement.,105,,
750,0.97,3888.184,3895.358,We know that that's being more Caudified in policy.,105,,
751,0.97,3895.358,3903.199,Can you give me a little bit more information about your concern and what you've been hearing in your district and businesses?,105,,
752,0.97,3903.199,3905.234,"Also, this doesn't just stay in district four.",105,,
753,0.97,3905.234,3911.207,This will be city wide and others looking at this.,105,,
754,0.97,3911.207,3917.38,And I think that Madame chair brought this up too.,105,,
755,0.97,3917.38,3922.618,What would be the effect of the five other B.I.A .'s out there.,105,,
756,0.97,3922.618,3929.592,"Can you focus on that and maybe what the effect is city wide, not just your district?",105,,
757,0.97,3929.592,3929.825,Sure.,106,,
758,0.97,3929.825,3930.092,Happy to.,106,,
759,0.97,3930.092,3936.899,"Yolanda, is Yolanda still there to answer--.",106,,
760,0.97,3936.899,3937.133,Yes.,107,,
761,0.97,3937.133,3937.4,I'm here.,107,,
762,0.97,3937.4,3941.737,And Phillip is here too to help answer questions.,107,,
763,0.97,3941.871,3953.949,So one of the unique things about the area is the involvement of the University of Washington.,108,,
764,0.97,3953.949,3962.625,"Are they Atraditional rate payer, or is there something different about their--how they're defined in this?",108,,
765,0.97,3962.625,3963.559,Yeah.,109,,
766,0.97,3963.559,3969.332,"The University of Washington, and Phillip, correct me if I'm wrong, but it is a voluntary rate payer.",109,,
767,0.97,3969.332,3973.269,They do not have to pay in.,109,,
768,0.97,3973.269,3980.276,"They are specifically cited in the ordinance, in the legislation, as a unique rate payer.",109,,
769,0.97,3980.276,3989.652,"And so they have elected to pay a certain amount, I think around 35% of the total assessment.",109,,
770,0.97,3989.652,3996.692,And they have selected the amount that they are contributing to the B.I.,109,,
771,0.97,3996.692,3996.826,A.,109,,
772,0.97,3996.826,4001.697,Whereas other rate payers are assessed according to a specific formula that is described in the legislation.,109,,
773,0.97,4001.831,4015.578,And then the state law requires that rate payers who want to petition for a B.I.A.,110,,
774,0.97,4015.578,4029.392,"That it's 60% of the rate payers in terms of the assessed value is how much of that 60% or 65% now, how much of that is the University of Washington approximately?",110,,
775,0.97,4029.525,4037.833,"Phillip, do you want to talk about the petitions?",111,,
776,0.97,4037.833,4038.067,Sure.,112,,
777,0.97,4038.067,4040.836,The current process as stated by the C.R.C.W.,112,,
778,0.97,4040.836,4044.707,Is 60% of the impact of the rate payers are higher.,112,,
779,0.97,4044.707,4055.951,"In the case of a single entity represents more than 25% of the petition, the threshold at the local level increases to 65% of support.",112,,
780,0.97,4055.951,4066.128,"In the current authorization, the University of Washington represents 34.89% of the petitions.",112,,
781,0.97,4066.128,4066.862,That's the total.,112,,
782,0.97,4066.862,4075.971,"Keep in mind, also, government entities like the University of Washington, the port of Seattle, for example, are generally exempt from B.I.A.",112,,
783,0.97,4075.971,4078.941,"Assessments, unless they're in a competitive marketplace.",112,,
784,0.97,4078.941,4093.389,"It was determined through the most recent creation of the 2015U district Bia given the size and the magnitude of the benefit and impacts the University creates, they should be a rate payer in the district.",112,,
785,0.97,4093.389,4099.028,That's how they were Crafted into the original ordinance.,112,,
786,0.97,4099.028,4101.864,So there are ten B.I.A .'s in Seattle currently?,113,,
787,0.97,4101.864,4113.509,So the University of Washington makes up half of the 65% of support that's required?,114,,
788,0.97,4113.642,4116.278,Yes.,115,,
789,0.97,4116.278,4116.745,"Based by payment, yes.",115,,
790,0.97,4116.879,4121.317,So the reason I'm asking the questions is clarifying that.,116,,
791,0.97,4121.317,4124.82,That does make the B.I.,116,,
792,0.97,4124.82,4127.823,A. in the University district unique.,116,,
793,0.97,4127.823,4141.437,The generous involvement and contribution voluntarily of the University of Washington that gives them a certain number of board seats on the rate payer advisory board.,116,,
794,0.97,4141.437,4149.111,"So having the program manager, having it compete, it just makes more sense in this context.",116,,
795,0.97,4149.411,4152.481,.,116,,
796,0.97,4153.549,4157.987,So I do want to thank you for that third amendment.,117,,
797,0.97,4157.987,4164.593,"You know, I appreciate--it's important to acknowledge the role that institutions play in the city.",117,,
798,0.97,4164.593,4166.862,They provide jobs and important services to our community.,117,,
799,0.97,4166.862,4177.273,But they shouldn't have a disproportionate influence of what happens and how our decisions about how the neighborhoods change and grow.,117,,
800,0.97,4177.273,4192.521,"Nrz so I'm eager to talk to you about that particular amendment and make sure that, you know, B.I.A .'s are set up with the purpose of giving smaller businesses a collective voice.",117,,
801,0.97,4192.521,4197.092,So I think that's something I'll want to talk to you about.,117,,
802,0.97,4197.092,4200.262,"Council member Juarez, did you get your question answered?",117,,
803,0.97,4200.262,4201.297,No.,118,,
804,0.97,4201.297,4217.146,"What I'm getting at is number one, how this would affect the other B.I.A.S, but for the fact the Uw is unique.",118,,
805,0.97,4217.146,4236.565,"And Council member Pedersen, if you could walk me through what the whole--what I'm guessing at, I'll be candid, is you believe a sole source contract is giving the University of Washington as the chairwoman suggested, a disproportionate amount of representation.",118,,
806,0.97,4236.565,4242.238,"Therefore, if you have an Rfp process, this would negate that.",118,,
807,0.97,4242.238,4252.915,"Can we focus on that sole source contract, Uw's participation and whether or not they have disproportionate representation.",118,,
808,0.97,4252.915,4260.155,"And Secondly, which I think we should think about, and I don't care one way or another.",118,,
809,0.97,4260.155,4266.629,Could this mean that the University of Washington since they're participating voluntarily withdraw from the B.I.A .?,118,,
810,0.97,4266.629,4278.974,"If that's the concern, then if it's $1 million, does that mean that the Uw is contributing anywhere between 3 and $400,000?",118,,
811,0.97,4278.974,4279.875,No.,119,,
812,0.97,4279.875,4281.844,Thank you for the question.,119,,
813,0.97,4281.844,4286.048,I think the concern is setting a precedent.,119,,
814,0.97,4286.048,4294.556,I was trying to address the concern about setting a precedent for the other B.I.A.S.,119,,
815,0.97,4294.556,4301.697,The U district is unique because of the University of Washington's involvement.,119,,
816,0.97,4301.697,4302.631,Which is appreciated.,119,,
817,0.97,4302.631,4307.202,And Phillip can talk about this because I'm focused on what's happening in district four.,119,,
818,0.97,4307.202,4311.607,But I think that University of Washington's involvement makes it unique.,119,,
819,0.97,4311.607,4324.987,"In terms of the competitive process, I do also want to emphasize that I do think that there should be competitive process when awarding these dollars.",119,,
820,0.97,4324.987,4328.824,"At the beginning of your remarks, you mentioned that.",119,,
821,0.97,4328.824,4342.137,That is an important principle I believe and I believe that's why it's put in the legislation to begin with from the executive.,119,,
822,0.97,4342.137,4343.338,But Phillip from O.E.D.,119,,
823,0.97,4343.338,4346.875,Could perhaps address how precedents are set with the legislation.,119,,
824,0.97,4346.875,4351.58,I thought each piece of legislation would be unique in how it's Reauthorized.,119,,
825,0.97,4351.58,4361.59,But we have a strong case to make that the involvement of a large institution is what makes it unique in district four.,119,,
826,0.97,4361.724,4378.474,So we do believe that a creation of a new Rfp process in separation of the annual public meeting could create precedent.,120,,
827,0.97,4378.474,4381.677,Each is designed for the local needs and the local design process.,120,,
828,0.97,4381.677,4388.55,In the case of a future renewal of a creation of a new B.I.A.,120,,
829,0.97,4388.55,4402.498,One can make the case the opposition can cite is U district example where it can be formed and a year later an Rfp process will be enacted.,120,,
830,0.97,4402.498,4407.236,I think that that precedent could occur based on the version of the legislation passed.,120,,
831,0.97,4407.536,4408.904,.,120,,
832,0.97,4412.441,4418.981,"But isn't it up to the city Council, Dunce the city council ultimately approve the legislation?",121,,
833,0.97,4418.981,4419.314,Corrected.,122,,
834,0.97,4419.314,4423.218,In terms of the proposed language as transmitted to O.E.D.,122,,
835,0.97,4423.218,4435.697,"For review for legislation to be drafted, they could design at that initial stage to request the Rfp language to be inserted.",122,,
836,0.97,4435.697,4445.474,Or it could be that a separate group requests the Council to submit the language citing the U district B.I.A.,122,,
837,0.97,4445.474,4445.741,Precedent.,122,,
838,0.97,4445.874,4446.942,Okay.,123,,
839,0.97,4447.075,4448.844,Okay.,124,,
840,0.97,4448.844,4449.244,Thank you Phillip.,124,,
841,0.97,4449.244,4454.983,Other questions or comments about the proposal?,124,,
842,0.97,4455.117,4462.157,"I have one last follow-up, Madame chair.",125,,
843,0.97,4462.157,4462.391,Okay.,126,,
844,0.97,4462.391,4464.092,"Phillip, first of all, thank you.",127,,
845,0.97,4464.092,4465.828,I loved your power point last week.,127,,
846,0.97,4465.828,4476.238,One of the best I've seen in a long time and I'm big on power points with information.,127,,
847,0.97,4476.238,4477.072,"And you too, Bobby Lee.",127,,
848,0.97,4477.072,4481.71,How much does the University of Washington contribute to the B.I.A .?,127,,
849,0.97,4481.844,4491.386,"If I am looking at my notes correctly, I think it's somewhere slightly north of $430,000.",128,,
850,0.97,4491.687,4493.989,.,128,,
851,0.97,4505.534,4505.734,Thank you.,129,,
852,0.97,4506.034,4508.403,.,129,,
853,0.97,4513.542,4514.209,"Any other questions, colleagues?",130,,
854,0.97,4514.51,4516.845,Okay.,130,,
855,0.97,4521.149,4527.589,"Council member Pedersen, any final comments you want to make about this?",130,,
856,0.97,4527.589,4529.524,"Thank you, chair Morales.",131,,
857,0.97,4529.524,4539.701,"I want to thank, again, central staff, office of economic development, all the people who took the time out of their day to testify at the public hearing.",131,,
858,0.97,4539.701,4542.504,We're also getting a lot of E-Mails as well.,131,,

860,0.97,4545.207,4549.578,A. and we'll look forward to the discussion on June 3RD.,131,,
861,0.97,4549.878,4551.546,.,131,,
862,0.97,4555.984,4556.151,Okay.,132,,

869,0.97,4588.383,4594.556,"Yesterday, my staff circulated a proclamation recognizing pride Asia day.",132,,
870,0.97,4594.556,4608.136,"And so as chair of the economic development Committee, I want to ask for your support before we adjourn in signing this proclamation.",132,,
871,0.97,4608.136,4608.637,I will do that now.,132,,
872,0.97,4608.637,4612.24,I want to stand with the city to raise the pride flag.,132,,
873,0.97,4612.24,4613.742,I'll be doing that on Monday.,132,,
874,0.97,4613.742,4617.946,And I would like to bring from the Council a proclamation for pride month.,132,,
875,0.97,4617.946,4640.235,"I'm honored to stand with my neighbors in my community to celebrate and remember the continuing struggle for visibility just like the fight for visibility and against Criminalization at stone wall in 1969 sparked with the resistance from black, Brown, and Trans members of the pride community.",132,,
