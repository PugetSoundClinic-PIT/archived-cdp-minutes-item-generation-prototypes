556,0.97,4506.869,4552.08,"I do want to say before they get started, we have spent the last six months discussing the need for greater equity and how the city we allocate resources, we have talked a lot about these kinds of issues in relation to everything from homeless services that have impacts on our indigenous and black neighbors and we talked about equity in terms of how we invest in public health and equitable access to Covid vaccines, and of course we have talked about it in relation to public safety and how much we should be investing in communities who suffer disproportionately from community safety issues.",161,,
557,0.97,4552.08,4554.283,"And all of these conversations, community is telling us the same thing.",161,,
558,0.97,4554.283,4555.918,That is let communities implement their own strategies.,161,,
559,0.97,4555.918,4577.205,"Recently, we heard from doctor Ben Danielson at a recent meeting that said the city must be clear that what power we are transferring to the community, we must be clear about how we are transferring it, mostly because folks are sick of being at tables for decisions that have already been made.",161,,
560,0.97,4577.205,4586.281,As doctor Danielson said to Somma this is about naming the process itself and the city naming the power they are willing to shift.,161,,
561,0.97,4586.281,4596.458,"So we are here today to listen to what communities are asking for, namely a shift in how they access resources and Decision- making power.",161,,
562,0.97,4596.458,4598.126,So I want to clarify a few things.,161,,
563,0.97,4598.126,4601.229,The city has been doing Participatory budgeting since 2015.,161,,
564,0.97,4601.229,4607.736,This is not a new thing that we are embarking on.,161,,
565,0.97,4607.736,4614.309,We already have Online tools for submitting ideas and foreboding.,161,,
566,0.97,4614.309,4641.036,"City staff already have some experience supporting neighbors through the project development phase and we already have a system for paper ballots and Online voting, so we can certainly learn some things from how we have done this in the past and it is time to scale up all of that work and to increase access for communities that have been left out of our decision-making processes.",161,,
567,0.97,4641.036,4658.553,I am excited to hear from our Presenters . I know we will have questions for them but we want to go ahead and move now to Shaun glaze and Letania severe.,161,,
568,0.97,4658.553,4660.088,"Thank you, everyone who is listening.",162,,
569,0.97,4660.088,4674.703,I also am just incredibly moved to be presenting this research because the community has entrusted us with this process and with sharing stories with us.,162,,
570,0.97,4674.703,4680.876,I also want to give a shout out to the Edi team.,162,,
571,0.97,4680.876,4681.61,They do great work.,162,,
572,0.97,4681.61,4697.726,We have heard from the community how crucial they are and how trusted they are to be able to really get why looking at making sure the folks who should be making the decisions are front and center.,162,,
573,0.97,4697.726,4698.727,I want to say that.,162,,
574,0.97,4698.727,4720.015,I will go ahead and kick it off with--we are on the ancestral and current lands of--I am here.,162,,
575,0.97,4721.116,4725.32,"I am excited to represent this tribe and to bring them into this phase to say thank you, appreciation, and gratitude.",162,,
576,0.97,4725.32,4754.382,"I want to do things--this is important but also because native sovereignty and black liberation are intertwined and as we present on the black brilliance research project, as we talk about what we have heard from communities and indigenous communities and people of color, white folks, everyone, I want to say first and foremost how we have been in this struggle together and now we are able to present what people want to see happen next.",162,,
577,0.97,4754.382,4763.091,"So that said, I know it is raining, I want to walk with you all and talk with you all.",162,,

579,0.97,4770.799,4771.8,These are the findings.,162,,
580,0.97,4771.8,4773.869,We know that this research did not come out of nowhere.,162,,
581,0.97,4773.869,4788.95,"It came out of decades of struggle by black and Brown folks, saying, Hey, will you stop killing us and invest what we know keeps a safer, healthier, and what we need to thrive?",162,,
582,0.97,4788.95,4812.641,"This all came to a head in part due to the police murderers of George Floyd and several other black community members and it is important to note that people continue to face harmed by police, including by police in Seattle and King County.",162,,
583,0.97,4812.641,4842.938,"Happened, protests, tens of thousands in the street, marching every day and without them we would not have this research because enough pressure was put into place that we were able to use a blueprint, to come up with a plan and the plan said let's do research and then ask the community what they want to say and ask what they need in order to be safer and to be healthier and to thrive and to turn that information into a plan.",162,,
584,0.97,4842.938,4867.896,We are not just doing research for researchers say quit doing it really develop a plan and not just any plan but a plan that is rooted on the experience of black and Brown folks who are most harmed by policing violence and by our systemic and current investment in--as we try to build a roadmap for what to do instead.,162,,
585,0.97,4867.896,4870.065,"So, Spoilers, what we are doing instead is Participatory budgeting.",162,,
586,0.97,4870.065,4872.801,"That, as you said come we have done since 2015.",162,,
587,0.97,4872.801,4902.998,It is a democratic way of sharing resources . I thought I was sharing my screen.,162,,
588,0.97,4902.998,4907.535,Awesome.,163,,
589,0.97,4907.535,4908.77,We will go to slide number four.,163,,
590,0.97,4908.77,4921.95,So the community is eager to build a better world.,163,,
591,0.97,4921.95,4924.052,Most are not interested in continuing to invest in policing.,163,,
592,0.97,4924.052,4928.657,"They are interested in learning how to keep each other safe without police, coercion, or the threat of systemic violence or oppression.",163,,
593,0.97,4928.657,4932.127,"Some of the things we have been hearing, a list of them are on the list.",163,,
594,0.97,4932.127,4936.998,Invest in lived experiences.,163,,
595,0.97,4936.998,4950.612,Those closest to the problem are best suited to find a solution and they are the experts in this work.,163,,
596,0.97,4951.446,4957.085,"We want to adjust the root causes of harm and create healing, connection, nourishment, safety and support to prevent harm and to invest in Proactive and Preventative solutions.",163,,
597,0.97,4957.085,4958.119,Stop punishing individuals for system: failures.,163,,
598,0.97,4958.119,4984.913,"We need to transform failing systems like housing and communication and we--we need to embrace a new normal, to listen and follow and normalize leadership from those closest to the issue and foster solidarity across oppression that typically divide communities, such as Antiblack racism, Trans Phobia, Ableism, Ageism, and Sexism.",163,,
599,0.97,4984.913,4986.314,We can go to the next slide.,163,,
600,0.97,4986.314,4994.823,Let's go up one go back one thank you.,163,,
601,0.97,4994.823,4998.526,"So throughout the research, these are the Takeaways that came up repeatedly.",163,,
602,0.97,4998.526,5010.105,And I will start with the quote here.,163,,
603,0.97,5010.105,5012.14,"Black women share, when they get resources, everyone gets Fed.",163,,
604,0.97,5012.14,5013.575,This is something we heard a lot.,163,,
605,0.97,5013.575,5015.61,"She is from aged 35 to 45, living in Seattle.",163,,
606,0.97,5015.61,5035.263,"We heard this a lot and that is why having this research, it means everybody will have an opportunity to see and--some of the things that we heard was stop causing harm.",163,,
607,0.97,5035.263,5036.564,"Favored criminal, legal, and other investments.",163,,
608,0.97,5036.564,5045.44,Eliminate workers and work that causes harm.,163,,
609,0.97,5045.44,5048.476,"Cut court, corrections, police, and probation funding and reinvest that into the community.",163,,
610,0.97,5048.476,5049.377,We are great inclusive policies.,163,,
611,0.97,5049.377,5061.756,This looks like Prioritizing workers with lived experiences and stupefying contracting.,163,,
612,0.97,5061.756,5064.092,Like organizations that can get funding to get the work they do.,163,,
613,0.97,5064.092,5070.198,Follow black leadership.,163,,
614,0.97,5070.198,5082.41,Partner with black life community organizations that specialize in the work and stop putting black leaders against one another and communities.,163,,
615,0.97,5082.41,5083.411,Pay for community expertise.,163,,
616,0.97,5083.411,5084.078,Fund black community expertise.,163,,
617,0.97,5084.078,5092.787,The city invested $3.9 million into this project to set priorities for Participatory budgeting and to create a roadmap for an inclusive equitable process in Seattle.,163,,
618,0.97,5092.787,5106.401,"As you heard, many times, it is extremely important that the city, the Council and the Mayor followed a roadmap that the community has created.",163,,
619,0.97,5106.401,5116.945,We must end the practice of elected officials and local government asking for community input and ignoring it and doing something different.,163,,
620,0.97,5116.945,5123.852,"Lastly, we need to invest in thriving solutions and making it easier to find effective resources and programming and invest in and identification and permanent harvesting.",163,,
621,0.97,5123.852,5124.853,Let's go to the next slide.,163,,
622,0.97,5124.853,5135.363,So what are the priorities that came out of the research to set the buckets for Participatory budgeting?,163,,
623,0.97,5135.363,5148.643,These are the five focus areas that were identified as the priorities that will be guiding the 2021 transfer process.,163,,
624,0.97,5148.643,5150.211,First we have housing and physical space.,163,,
625,0.97,5150.211,5155.149,"It is no surprise to anyone living in Seattle, that housing and physical space is number one number two, mental health was close to housing.",163,,
626,0.97,5155.149,5157.185,"I think prior to the pandemic, it was an issue.",163,,
627,0.97,5157.185,5174.202,I think it is exacerbated over the last year as we have changed the way we live and resources are hard to access especially for those that do not have access to Internet.,163,,
628,0.97,5174.202,5175.036,It is extremely difficult.,163,,
629,0.97,5175.036,5189.417,"We have seen a lot of inequality around getting care and vaccines and housing and mental health are at the top of the list, followed by youth and children, obviously, folks are working from home.",163,,
630,0.97,5189.417,5206.334,"I know that Sean has a kid, trying to do work while in the house and not having access to Childcare and it can be difficult.",163,,
631,0.97,5206.334,5208.937,"For those working, that are social workers, child care is a big issue.",163,,
632,0.97,5208.937,5210.605,"Again, mental health is exacerbated by the pandemic.",163,,
633,0.97,5210.605,5212.774,"Economic development is also not a surprise, especially in Seattle.",163,,
634,0.97,5212.774,5217.445,They need relief to address the triple crises we are in.,163,,
635,0.97,5217.445,5220.148,We are in a recession and there is systemic racism.,163,,
636,0.97,5220.148,5231.125,There is this cooperative solution that can create opportunities--that is what folks are saying.,163,,
637,0.97,5231.125,5236.965,"Lastly, we have a crisis with wellness.",163,,
638,0.97,5236.965,5239.367,We need alternatives to the harmful 911 and crisis response system.,163,,
639,0.97,5239.367,5241.336,This should be staffed by trained and skilled community members.,163,,
640,0.97,5241.336,5249.177,I will pass it to you.,163,,
641,0.97,5249.177,5250.178,"Great, that is wonderful.",164,,
642,0.97,5250.178,5252.847,"Okay, thank you, technology.",164,,
643,0.97,5252.847,5277.405,"Thank you for looking at some of the key findings fish has been presented on a weekly, every Monday, with the teach INS and with Email updates and we have been open to the public with office our.",164,,
644,0.97,5277.405,5279.107,None of that should tell Mike a surprise.,164,,
645,0.97,5279.107,5284.245,"Also, the next slide will not sell make much of a surprise but here we are with the main event, PB, or Participatory budgeting.",164,,
646,0.97,5284.245,5304.165,"We heard someone call it PB and J, and all it is is about creating or having an annual process where we the people get to decide how public money is PENT.",164,,
647,0.97,5304.165,5336.964,"We have been doing it Seattle since 2015 and smaller scale focused on parks and streets and other investments like sidewalks, and that is really important and now instead of relying strictly on parks and streets and those kind of capital investments, we said, Hey, you told us that you know what it takes to create true community safety and health, and you said it is housing and physical spaces, mental health and youth and children and economic development and crises and wellness.",164,,
648,0.97,5336.964,5338.766,Now it is time to design it out.,164,,
649,0.97,5338.766,5356.651,"Here, I have for you all this slide that shows the different steps and we are in the design phase, and that is when that community talks and says this is what we wanted to look like, hence the research.",164,,
650,0.97,5356.651,5358.686,"Is where the outreach starts, which has already kicked off.",164,,
651,0.97,5358.686,5360.488,People are doing teach INS and people are excited.,164,,
652,0.97,5360.488,5369.897,That is also the stage of where the steering committee has been selected.,164,,
653,0.97,5369.897,5384.846,"After the design, after we get together and say here is a roadmap anger 1200, 1300 page remarked that will look at those--it explains some important considerations with barriers and it highlights the importance of investing deeply in Digital equity.",164,,
654,0.97,5411.773,5412.073,Next.,165,,
655,0.97,5412.073,5417.044,"The fun part of coming up with ideas related to those buckets, those investment areas.",165,,
656,0.97,5417.044,5419.947,That's going to happen next.,165,,
657,0.97,5419.947,5423.317,Community is going to Brainstorm like we have been doing for years.,165,,
658,0.97,5423.317,5424.919,What kind of projects we recommend.,165,,
659,0.97,5424.919,5430.758,And then we turn those into things people can vote on.,165,,
660,0.97,5430.758,5431.426,We tall them proposals.,165,,
661,0.97,5431.426,5436.697,And turn them into issues on the ballot that people can say yes.,165,,
662,0.97,5436.697,5437.064,Or Nah to.,165,,
663,0.97,5437.064,5440.234,So the winning projects are the ones that get funded.,165,,
664,0.97,5440.234,5442.27,So the most votes wins.,165,,
665,0.97,5442.27,5455.85,"And what's really exciting is, we've heard from community several times about how sometimes when we say a process is democratic, we don't really consider the fact that we don't have a level playing field.",165,,
666,0.97,5455.85,5458.186,For just about any system that you can think of.,165,,
667,0.97,5458.186,5460.288,The playing field is not level.,165,,
668,0.97,5460.288,5467.995,So being able to ask about the specific ways people have been locked out of the democratic process.,165,,
669,0.97,5467.995,5470.565,"And identify solutions together, not just with community members.",165,,
670,0.97,5470.565,5484.579,"But also, city workers who are able to give us insights in terms of how like institutional racism has functioned, in terms of how they're able to make change or stop that from moving forward.",165,,
671,0.97,5484.579,5488.149,Has been an incredible part of this research process.,165,,
672,0.97,5488.149,5491.586,You all want to talk about the steering committee?,166,,
673,0.97,5491.586,5497.124,"Because I promise you, we have looked at the frequently asked questions.",166,,
674,0.97,5497.124,5501.429,And the Steerin committee and how they're select side number 1. let's go ahead and launch into that.,166,,
675,0.97,5501.429,5504.165,And the design phase is when the steering committee is picked.,166,,
676,0.97,5504.165,5505.299,Who is the steering committee?,166,,
677,0.97,5505.299,5513.107,"Thesteering Committee is a group of people who make the rules for P.D., which is Participatory budgeting.",166,,
678,0.97,5513.107,5527.221,"And what we heard from community is that usually, when there's some type of job that is important like this, the people who are evaluating the jobs don't often have the expertise and the experience to know like who is good for this role or who is not.",166,,
679,0.97,5527.221,5539.7,"So what we came up with, when we talked to community is that people are interested in having a process where the job descriptions for the steering committee are posted widely.",166,,
680,0.97,5539.7,5546.974,"And then from the most of requested group of people, we're going to call it like your candidate pool.",166,,
681,0.97,5546.974,5548.976,Like your top notch candidate pool.,166,,
682,0.97,5548.976,5551.846,Some amount of people will be selected.,166,,
683,0.97,5551.846,5559.186,"10 people, will be selected from those most qualified Torandomly be on a jury.",166,,
684,0.97,5559.186,5561.622,Just like you get jury duty in the mail.,166,,
685,0.97,5561.622,5565.96,You would get jury duty to help serve the steering committee.,166,,
686,0.97,5565.96,5566.494,That's really important.,166,,
687,0.97,5566.494,5581.742,"Because that means that the people who, you know, could steering committee, based on the criteria, are also the ones who are evaluating who makes a good fit for the steering committee.",166,,
688,0.97,5581.742,5582.209,So job descriptions.,166,,
689,0.97,5582.209,5585.146,"Candidate pool, a small number of them become the jury.",166,,
690,0.97,5585.146,5589.45,And they review it to the other high scores.,166,,
691,0.97,5589.45,5590.284,That's really exciting.,166,,
692,0.97,5590.284,5595.222,And then am I supposed to pass this you?,166,,
693,0.97,5595.222,5596.324,My bad.,166,,
694,0.97,5596.324,5596.591,Yes.,167,,
695,0.97,5596.591,5597.458,I'm up.,167,,
696,0.97,5597.458,5598.059,Thank you.,167,,
697,0.97,5598.059,5600.628,What are these criteria Sean is talking about?,167,,
698,0.97,5600.628,5601.095,Here they are.,167,,
699,0.97,5601.095,5603.731,I'm just going to read them out.,167,,
700,0.97,5603.731,5605.232,This is what they're.,167,,
701,0.97,5605.232,5610.905,The steering committee crises Terriaux must include people with the following lived experience.,167,,
702,0.97,5610.905,5613.941,We have been talking about following the importance of lived experiences.,167,,
703,0.97,5613.941,5625.152,"And here are the experiences that people told us time and time again, needed the very integral to the leadership role within Participatory budgeting.",167,,
704,0.97,5625.152,5628.622,"Number 1, we have people who have been incarcerated.",167,,
705,0.97,5628.622,5634.462,"Number 2, people who are well connected to multiple community organizations.",167,,
706,0.97,5634.462,5636.831,Number 3. people with lived experience of homelessness.,167,,
707,0.97,5636.831,5638.332,"Number 4, people with Diabilities.",167,,
708,0.97,5638.332,5647.708,"Number 5, people who are Trans, Nonbinary, or Gender- Nonconforming.",167,,
709,0.97,5647.708,5650.044,"Number 6, black women.",167,,
710,0.97,5650.044,5652.747,"7, older adults.",167,,
711,0.97,5652.747,5653.014,"8, youth.",167,,
712,0.97,5653.014,5655.282,You may ask why two?,167,,
713,0.97,5655.282,5660.187,"When you get young people, a lot of times their voice gets drown out.",167,,
714,0.97,5660.187,5672.6,At least give two young people an opportunity to work together and amplify their voice a little more in a group of other adults.,167,,
715,0.97,5672.6,5674.869,People from the African Diaspora.,167,,
716,0.97,5674.869,5679.774,"10, a person appointed by Duwamish tribal services, at least one person.",167,,
717,0.97,5679.774,5688.015,"And number 11, people from communities Overrepresented in negative health outcomes.",167,,
718,0.97,5688.015,5691.118,"Back to you, Shawn.",167,,
719,0.97,5691.118,5692.62,I had to Chase my kid.,168,,
720,0.97,5692.62,5696.09,There we go.,168,,
721,0.97,5696.09,5696.69,Here we are.,168,,
722,0.97,5696.69,5701.328,So your steering committee is seven people.,168,,
723,0.97,5701.328,5711.639,"And you know, 7 people because that's a number people said was small enough to make decisions, like nimbly enough in order to be successful.",168,,
724,0.97,5711.639,5720.314,"But you know, it's not just seven people you are working along P.B.",168,,
725,0.97,5720.314,5723.35,"In P.B., everyone can be part.",168,,
726,0.97,5723.35,5725.052,Steering Committee is paid.,168,,
727,0.97,5725.052,5726.187,Jury is paid.,168,,
728,0.97,5726.187,5733.694,Thennee have these other community member who are serving almost like a cabinet.,168,,
729,0.97,5733.694,5735.663,So several people serving together to make P.B.,168,,
730,0.97,5735.663,5736.163,Happen.,168,,
731,0.97,5736.163,5745.039,And I'm sure there will be hundreds if not thousands of people to volunteer their time to help move this effort along as well.,168,,
732,0.97,5745.039,5749.143,See so here are your P.B.,168,,
733,0.97,5749.143,5749.443,Work Jupes.,168,,
734,0.97,5749.443,5752.88,Have you your steering committee which we talked about.,168,,
735,0.97,5752.88,5754.348,You also have your accountability Workgroup.,168,,
736,0.97,5754.348,5758.686,They're looking for feedback on how the decision-making process is going.,168,,
737,0.97,5758.686,5768.195,"Helping to develop out the community agreements or Cov Nants, some people use that language.",168,,
738,0.97,5768.195,5768.729,Grounding principals.,168,,
739,0.97,5768.729,5772.6,In part of the research themselves.,168,,
740,0.97,5772.6,5776.904,Which has some information on that and in part based on their expertise.,168,,
741,0.97,5776.904,5778.239,That's why they were hired into this position.,168,,
742,0.97,5778.239,5785.779,"They're also the work group that is going to be bringing appropriate parties together to resolve issues, because we are humans and we have conflict.",168,,
743,0.97,5785.779,5789.15,And we need to make sure that we expect conflict.,168,,
744,0.97,5789.15,5792.153,And make sure that it's going to be handled.,168,,
745,0.97,5792.153,5794.555,Accountability work group is that work group.,168,,
746,0.97,5794.555,5799.393,We also have your outreach work group.,168,,
747,0.97,5799.393,5811.138,If you are an Extroverted person and you love talking to community and you make sure no one is left out.,168,,
748,0.97,5811.138,5814.408,Outreach work group is probably your jam.,168,,
749,0.97,5814.408,5821.248,You are passionate about spreading the word and making sure people are included.,168,,
750,0.97,5821.248,5824.518,Similarly have budget delegates and process Facilitators.,168,,
751,0.97,5824.518,5831.959,So if you are someone who really loved office supplies and organizing things and getting files and filing cabinets.,168,,
752,0.97,5831.959,5836.564,You probably would see yourself here.,168,,
753,0.97,5836.564,5839.7,"Budget delegates and Processfacilitators, take the information and make it easier to understand.",168,,
754,0.97,5839.7,5842.87,"They take all of these things like this is the same idea, seven times.",168,,
755,0.97,5842.87,5845.873,And they make it into like one thing.,168,,
756,0.97,5845.873,5848.209,So we're not all sifting through as much information.,168,,
757,0.97,5848.209,5850.945,And they also help make sure that the process is on track.,168,,
758,0.97,5850.945,5859.253,We'll talk--we can talk more about that work group or any of these work groups in Q & amp; a.,168,,
759,0.97,5859.253,5862.489,The restorative and safety group is also crucial.,169,,
760,0.97,5862.489,5862.957,They make sure P.B.,169,,
761,0.97,5862.957,5868.195,Is on track.,169,,
762,0.97,5868.195,5869.23,We started all of this.,169,,
763,0.97,5869.23,5876.604,Because we knew there needed to be less investments in the things that hurt us and more investment in the things that promote like health and healing.,169,,
764,0.97,5876.604,5883.444,So we want to make sure there is a work group that is hyper focused on what and knows conversation in the community.,169,,
765,0.97,5883.444,5888.549,And the last work group I want to explain here is the Livered experience work group.,169,,
766,0.97,5888.549,5897.524,"There are a variety of different experiences that people said would be helpful to add their voice, expertise to the P.B.",169,,
767,0.97,5897.524,5897.825,Process.,169,,
768,0.97,5897.825,5904.231,So we want to make sure our lived experience work group is where people can see themselves there.,169,,
769,0.97,5904.231,5907.601,"All of these work groups, working together, from community.",169,,
770,0.97,5907.601,5909.937,We have heard that they should be paid.,169,,
771,0.97,5909.937,5916.81,"Well compensated for their roles, similar to the city employees who are able to do work like this as part of the city.",169,,
772,0.97,5916.81,5923.951,There's so many times we heard story after story of people being paid with like Pizza.,169,,
773,0.97,5923.951,5925.753,"Earlier, we heard soup, right?",169,,
774,0.97,5925.753,5930.524,Maybe you get like a $25 gift card or gas card.,169,,
775,0.97,5930.524,5938.432,"Meanwhile, the other people in the room who are still listening to your feedback.",169,,
776,0.97,5938.432,5940.534,"Are making sometimes 40, $50 an hour or more.",169,,
777,0.97,5940.534,5944.438,And we want to see community pays strong equity.,169,,
778,0.97,5944.438,5952.279,"And that community wants to see, community members themselves, being the leaders, the architects, the drivers of this process.",169,,
779,0.97,5952.279,5959.82,"And that city employees can play an important supportive role, do things like writing checks.",169,,
780,0.97,5959.82,5968.395,Doing things like connecting these work group members Withpeople who can advise them on a particular topic.,169,,
781,0.97,5968.395,5972.433,"And also, offering requested answers, related to like a city process.",169,,
782,0.97,5972.433,5985.913,"So in every one of these work groups, you all, we are expecting that those who are most likely to be harmed or killed by systemic racism and violence are centered.",169,,
783,0.97,5985.913,5987.915,This helps ensure they honor equity.,169,,
784,0.97,5987.915,5992.686,"And that the people who are most Parmed are front and center, really leading this work.",169,,
785,0.97,5992.686,5997.057,"With that said, I think I pass it back to wei.",169,,
786,0.97,5997.057,5997.524,You do.,170,,
787,0.97,5997.524,5999.626,Thank you.,170,,
788,0.97,5999.626,5999.927,All right.,170,,
789,0.97,5999.927,6001.095,When are we doing this?,170,,
790,0.97,6001.095,6005.699,We're doing it right now.,170,,
791,0.97,6005.699,6006.7,So Yeah.,170,,
792,0.97,6006.7,6008.335,This process was already started.,170,,
793,0.97,6008.335,6010.104,Obviously we're in the design phase now.,170,,
794,0.97,6010.104,6012.473,We're also in the outreach phase.,170,,
795,0.97,6012.473,6017.011,There have been teachings happening all over the city.,170,,
796,0.97,6017.011,6018.145,Folks have taken P.B.,170,,
797,0.97,6018.145,6020.647,Toolkit that was created out of this research.,170,,
798,0.97,6020.647,6021.148,And they've gone out.,170,,
799,0.97,6021.148,6024.952,"And they are spreading the word to their family, friends and networks.",170,,
800,0.97,6024.952,6027.02,"And you, too, can do that.",170,,
801,0.97,6027.02,6035.829,I will share that information with you so that you can spread the word off Pb2 off any and everyone.,170,,
802,0.97,6035.829,6036.864,So they can be involved.,170,,
803,0.97,6036.864,6042.469,So our goal here is to get started real soon.,170,,
804,0.97,6042.469,6043.837,So today is February 26th.,170,,
805,0.97,6043.837,6046.74,And you see March 7th on their idea collection.,170,,
806,0.97,6046.74,6050.043,We would love to get started on idea collection real soon.,170,,
807,0.97,6050.043,6052.579,And let that go through April.,170,,
808,0.97,6052.579,6052.98,Late April.,170,,
809,0.97,6052.98,6060.954,So folks can have an opportunity to start putting in their ideas about--that fall within those five buckets.,170,,
810,0.97,6060.954,6069.063,And the things they want to see to improve their community and bring safety is health and thriving to their community.,170,,
811,0.97,6069.063,6073.7,"So then after that, it would be project development.",170,,
812,0.97,6073.7,6076.77,Project development is where ideas become actual concrete proposals.,170,,
813,0.97,6076.77,6085.045,That would be with the help of folks who understand Scoping and are budget delegates.,170,,
814,0.97,6085.045,6086.98,And process Facilitators.,170,,
815,0.97,6086.98,6088.982,Will assist with that.,170,,
816,0.97,6088.982,6093.821,That will be April through July 12th.,170,,
817,0.97,6093.821,6095.389,And then into voting.,170,,
818,0.97,6095.389,6097.357,So voting could be Online and off line.,170,,
819,0.97,6097.357,6101.929,We want to make sure we make this process as accessible as possible.,170,,
820,0.97,6101.929,6103.73,We've even put in information into the report.,170,,
821,0.97,6103.73,6114.274,"About how we can work with families of individuals who are currently incarcerated with individuals to give them the idea for a portion of this process, as well as in the voting process.",170,,
822,0.97,6114.274,6120.147,So we have a few ideas of how Offline voting can work in the report.,170,,
823,0.97,6120.147,6125.586,"And then after voting happens, funding, and implementation.",170,,
824,0.97,6125.586,6128.622,Hopefully late 2021.,170,,
825,0.97,6128.622,6129.857,So later this year.,170,,
826,0.97,6129.857,6132.326,And this shouldn't be a one- time process.,170,,
827,0.97,6132.326,6135.562,I know we got one-time funding.,170,,
828,0.97,6135.562,6136.196,But that's just a technicality.,170,,
829,0.97,6136.196,6143.37,I'm looking forward to the city opening up new funding opportunities to make this the way we do business.,170,,
830,0.97,6143.37,6151.745,"I think the community should always have opportunity to decide how community funds, city funds are being spent.",170,,
831,0.97,6151.745,6156.55,"And we've heard from, you know, Shawn mentioned before, we've talked to a lot of people in community.",170,,
832,0.97,6156.55,6160.053,But we've also talked to a lot of people within the city and different city departments.,170,,
833,0.97,6160.053,6162.523,And they have money that they would love to put through PB.,170,,
834,0.97,6162.523,6166.059,I think it just has to become the culture of the city.,170,,
835,0.97,6166.059,6176.136,"That, you know, departments have the opportunity to put should percentage or some amount of their annual budget through a P.B.",170,,
836,0.97,6176.136,6176.603,Process.,170,,
837,0.97,6176.603,6180.374,It promotes a democratic and civic engagement.,170,,
838,0.97,6180.374,6182.676,And democratic way of spending money.,170,,
839,0.97,6182.676,6184.011,And investing in community.,170,,
840,0.97,6184.011,6188.782,"And so, we look for the next process to start late this year.",170,,
841,0.97,6188.782,6192.92,We have kind of--what do you call it?,170,,
842,0.97,6192.92,6199.193,"You call it a session planning, that will allow for the people who are allowing P.B.",170,,
843,0.97,6199.193,6206.733,"To pass that knowledge onto the next folks who are running it during that late 2021, through February '22 process.",170,,
844,0.97,6206.733,6211.939,"So that we can get this whole thing going, again in 2022.",170,,
845,0.97,6211.939,6212.873,"And with that, questions?",170,,
846,0.97,6212.873,6214.541,And we got answers.,170,,
847,0.97,6214.541,6215.509,[Laughter],170,,
848,0.97,6215.509,6219.012,Maybe.,171,,
849,0.97,6219.012,6219.279,I do.,172,,
850,0.97,6219.279,6220.747,Thank you so much.,172,,
851,0.97,6220.747,6226.42,There's obviously just a ton of work that has gone into this.,172,,
852,0.97,6226.42,6231.658,So really appreciate both of you summarizing it so succinctly for us.,172,,
853,0.97,6231.658,6233.193,I'm sure my colleagues will have questions.,172,,
854,0.97,6233.193,6236.396,I have a couple of questions that I would love to just get us started with.,172,,
855,0.97,6236.396,6249.076,"So I know that we have been working with the executive's office and with CBO to try to understand, you know, what the implementation plan might look like.",172,,
856,0.97,6249.076,6253.947,I wonder if you all could just give a little update about how those conversations are going.,172,,
857,0.97,6253.947,6256.65,The departments that we think this is going to land in.,172,,
858,0.97,6256.65,6259.786,Some of those details.,172,,
859,0.97,6259.786,6260.087,Sure.,173,,
860,0.97,6260.087,6261.989,Ican certainly Chime in.,173,,
861,0.97,6261.989,6264.024,I will answer in reverse order.,173,,
862,0.97,6264.024,6265.459,In terms of the departments.,173,,
863,0.97,6265.459,6276.503,"We know that the departments that community says trust lives have not changed, even as we continued to collect data, ask people.",173,,
864,0.97,6276.503,6278.372,That is O.P.D .'s specifically the E.D.I.,173,,
865,0.97,6278.372,6279.006,Team.,173,,
866,0.97,6279.006,6280.674,"Who were presenting earlier, a little information.",173,,
867,0.97,6280.674,6281.742,I'm just like yes.,173,,
868,0.97,6281.742,6286.58,I can see Whyux absolutely.,173,,
869,0.97,6286.58,6290.417,"-- why, absolutely.",173,,
870,0.97,6290.417,6291.385,Thinking about long-term planning.,173,,
871,0.97,6291.385,6291.918,Racial equity.,173,,
872,0.97,6291.918,6292.552,Making long-term commitments.,173,,
873,0.97,6292.552,6300.961,"But also seeing how to visualize, how to understand, how to feel, how to taste, how to touch, equity, when it comes to city investments.",173,,
874,0.97,6300.961,6302.963,"So that's Hands-Down, favorite team.",173,,
875,0.97,6302.963,6310.537,And then we also heard people voice strong support for O.C.R.,173,,
876,0.97,6310.537,6311.872,And office of refugee and immigrant affairs.,173,,
877,0.97,6311.872,6314.374,So I would say that hasn't changed.,173,,
878,0.97,6314.374,6317.11,"My understanding is, you know, some of these decisions are still being made.",173,,
879,0.97,6317.11,6320.814,"Ultimately, it's going to be the Mayor's call, on how this gets implemented.",173,,
880,0.97,6320.814,6334.261,"My hope is that it will look something like what people are saying, which is that there will be a process, where there will be Coleads, who are helping to manage on the city side some of this.",173,,
881,0.97,6334.261,6340.067,That looks a lot like what the city workers might call an inner departmental team.,173,,
882,0.97,6340.067,6341.301,You all have different words for it.,173,,
883,0.97,6341.301,6352.145,"But if there's a group of people who will come together from several departments, and there will be at rest two Coleads who hope community is helping.",173,,
884,0.97,6352.145,6363.09,"From different departments, because we understand that the political reality is that sometimes people feel under pressure to do something that may or may not be consistent with what they want to do.",173,,
885,0.97,6363.09,6365.992,And there's another Department that might not feel the same pressure.,173,,
886,0.97,6365.992,6372.833,"So being able to share the pressure, because it is going to be a very visible process, is really important.",173,,
887,0.97,6372.833,6379.573,We also heard that community wants there to be like three Subcommittees as part of that.,173,,
888,0.97,6379.573,6383.71,One that's just in charge of accountability.,173,,
889,0.97,6383.71,6389.382,"Making sure that the city side peace, when we're expecting to be fairly small.",173,,
890,0.97,6389.382,6394.888,Because most of the things the city has done before are all things the community is excited to run.,173,,
891,0.97,6394.888,6395.188,Out reach.,173,,
892,0.97,6395.188,6397.657,Excited to run dealing with conflicts that come up.,173,,
893,0.97,6397.657,6405.298,"Excited to run, creating the rules and the process, and getting the votes and all of those things are Communityside pieces.",173,,
894,0.97,6405.298,6407.434,So we're really looking forward to seeing that.,173,,
895,0.97,6407.434,6412.773,"And in terms of the budget, the budget more specifically how the city wants to implement it.",173,,
896,0.97,6412.773,6415.742,We did present a spending plan this week.,173,,
897,0.97,6415.742,6420.447,"And we have another meeting a little bit later today, actually, to nail down some details.",173,,
898,0.97,6420.447,6424.584,"I can tell you, through our conversations, again, with city workers.",173,,
899,0.97,6424.584,6430.19,"And with our supervisors, from various departments, even more departments than the ones I'Listing here.",173,,
900,0.97,6430.19,6436.596,"People have told us that generally, they're not expecting more staff to need this work.",173,,
901,0.97,6436.596,6442.869,"Generally, expecting 1 that adding a staff member actually means you have to train them up and it's kind of a wash.",173,,
902,0.97,6442.869,6447.808,"But two, the things we're looking for.",173,,
903,0.97,6447.808,6452.112,"Things like writing checks, who to connect with, those people won't be a heavy lift.",173,,
904,0.97,6452.112,6456.316,"And the report itself, can you see the kinds of roles that we're imagining.",173,,
905,0.97,6456.316,6462.355,But it sounds like community is expecting fewer than five F.T.E.S to be added.,173,,
906,0.97,6462.355,6465.258,Two of them specifically on Digital equity.,173,,
907,0.97,6465.258,6471.965,"Because we really want to make sure that that is expedited, so that people can participate Robustly.",173,,
908,0.97,6471.965,6481.842,"And then other than that, the other three F.T.E.S, I imagine would be a conversation negotiation, we meet with the budget folks later today.",173,,
909,0.97,6481.842,6484.311,"Does that answer your question, Councilmember Morales?",173,,
910,0.97,6484.311,6484.911,Yes.,174,,
911,0.97,6484.911,6487.28,Did you want to add anything to that?,174,,
912,0.97,6487.28,6494.621,I just add that I know like I think this process is a bit different for the city.,175,,
913,0.97,6494.621,6499.426,And there will be Growingpains.,175,,
914,0.97,6499.426,6503.23,And I think the power that the city had in the past.,175,,
915,0.97,6503.23,6507.801,"We recognize, this is very different.",175,,
916,0.97,6507.801,6509.736,It's putting trust in community.,175,,
917,0.97,6509.736,6516.343,"And putting power Intocommunity's hands, and allowing them to--all of us to be able to steer this process along.",175,,
918,0.97,6516.343,6522.349,"And you know, I just challenge the city, city government.",175,,
919,0.97,6522.349,6533.86,"All, those of you who are in council as well as Mayor's office, and even within departments, to just kind of step outside that role and just follow community's lead.",175,,
920,0.97,6533.86,6538.431,Because this is just a great opportunity to do something different.,175,,
921,0.97,6538.431,6545.639,"At least last year, it sounded like folks were very excited about doing something different.",175,,
922,0.97,6545.639,6547.541,At least from the city side.,175,,
923,0.97,6547.541,6551.978,And we'd like to see that give it an opportunity to happen throughout this year.,175,,
924,0.97,6551.978,6559.953,So that we can make this process what community believes it should be.,175,,
925,0.97,6559.953,6561.388,Okay.,176,,
926,0.97,6561.388,6563.957,So I know it's in the report.,176,,
927,0.97,6563.957,6580.307,"But I do--would like to know if you could just sort of summarize the connection between the role of the steering committee and the role of the city, the kind of support or, you know, how you see the relationship working?",176,,
928,0.97,6580.307,6581.908,Absolutely.,177,,
929,0.97,6581.908,6585.078,Let me see about this slide and the Q & amp; a for that.,177,,
930,0.97,6585.078,6587.48,I was thinking the same thing.,178,,
931,0.97,6587.48,6587.881,The yellow one?,178,,
932,0.97,6587.881,6590.417,"I know, the yellow one is like the winner.",179,,
933,0.97,6590.417,6591.318,It's not in here.,180,,
934,0.97,6591.318,6591.585,Yeah.,181,,
935,0.97,6591.585,6592.919,It's in the other one here.,181,,
936,0.97,6592.919,6596.423,I can--do you want to pull it up?,181,,
937,0.97,6596.423,6599.025,"Yeah, I'll pull it up.",182,,
938,0.97,6599.025,6599.492,You talk.,182,,
939,0.97,6599.492,6599.859,Excellent.,183,,
940,0.97,6599.859,6602.796,That's the part I'm a little better at.,183,,
941,0.97,6602.796,6608.601,So we have a particular page that we have been developing and refining over time.,183,,
942,0.97,6608.601,6611.037,"Conversations with community, conversations with people who work in the city.",183,,
943,0.97,6611.037,6620.613,"Conversations with people who work as part of the Participatory budgeting project, which helps to support almost every single P.B.",183,,
944,0.97,6620.613,6623.116,Project in the United States.,183,,
945,0.97,6623.116,6623.516,Works with Pbp.,183,,
946,0.97,6623.516,6623.95,They're fantastic.,183,,
947,0.97,6623.95,6625.452,"They can tell you things like Oh, Yeah.",183,,
948,0.97,6625.452,6626.92,This is what happened in Albuquerque.,183,,
949,0.97,6626.92,6628.622,And this happened in New York.,183,,
950,0.97,6628.622,6633.026,"And Oh, Yeah, you might want to look out for this in this other location.",183,,
951,0.97,6633.026,6642.902,"So what we've come up with is this One-Pager that has on the left side, all the different--the three key roles we're looking for.",183,,
952,0.97,6642.902,6644.371,What those tasks are.,183,,
953,0.97,6644.371,6652.212,"And on the right side, once you're able to share your screen, will have like the specific activities and tasks and all of that.",183,,
954,0.97,6652.212,6662.522,"And then at the bottom, because we wanted to make sure it was super clear, is the sort of organizational structure that the city workers would have, in order to help see this forward.",183,,
955,0.97,6662.522,6664.758,So it's like a very packed slide.,183,,
956,0.97,6664.758,6668.795,It's not as pretty as the other slides.,183,,
957,0.97,6668.795,6669.662,"To address your question, though.",183,,
958,0.97,6669.662,6680.106,The kinds of things that we're looking for are sharing data SETS so that we can build out the Visualizations for racial equity.,183,,
959,0.97,6680.106,6680.54,"Sharing, of course.",183,,
960,0.97,6680.54,6690.583,Writing the checks because there will be about 35 folks who the city will contract with as part of the steering committee or some of these other work groups.,183,,
961,0.97,6690.583,6699.292,"It will be, being available to answer questions when somebody is like, does anyone know who was the city planner in 2019 for this particular site?",183,,
962,0.97,6699.292,6700.226,So things like that.,183,,
963,0.97,6700.226,6704.431,And that most of the heavy lift will be on the--thank you.,183,,
964,0.97,6704.431,6704.831,Community side.,183,,
965,0.97,6704.831,6706.966,So if we can zoom in a little.,183,,
966,0.97,6706.966,6708.635,Because my eyes can't do this.,183,,
967,0.97,6708.635,6711.137,Focusing.,184,,
968,0.97,6711.137,6711.871,Zoom in.,185,,
969,0.97,6711.871,6712.272,That's okay.,186,,
970,0.97,6712.272,6714.874,I can just read off what I can read.,186,,
971,0.97,6714.874,6717.711,So we see at the top.,186,,
972,0.97,6717.711,6720.38,We have on the left side.,186,,
973,0.97,6720.38,6721.815,Three sorts of positions.,186,,
974,0.97,6721.815,6725.618,"Most of these, again, are like existing positions.",186,,
975,0.97,6725.618,6729.722,"So we put that--or existing, people who are already city workers.",186,,
976,0.97,6729.722,6731.758,But like the different levels within.,186,,
977,0.97,6731.758,6743.303,"So your division manager, for example, who might be someone like Uba, from the E.D.I.",186,,
978,0.97,6743.303,6745.738,"Team, would basically help seam her staff members.",186,,
979,0.97,6745.738,6750.376,She might be the one who is talking to other city departments on occasion.,186,,
980,0.97,6750.376,6755.348,And then just making sure that everything is looking good and is transparent.,186,,
981,0.97,6755.348,6763.189,"On the flip side, you might have other member of, say, Uba's team, who would be taking point on supporting the steering committee.",186,,
982,0.97,6763.189,6769.762,So the steering committee has a question about a data set that O.P.C.D.,186,,
983,0.97,6769.762,6769.963,Has.,186,,
984,0.97,6769.963,6771.798,That coordinator person would be.,186,,
985,0.97,6771.798,6775.635,I will find that information or data set and get back to you.,186,,
986,0.97,6775.635,6776.97,It's that level of contact.,186,,
987,0.97,6776.97,6783.176,They might also be doing things like make Suring that there are partnerships with P.B.,186,,
988,0.97,6783.176,6783.409,Groups.,186,,
989,0.97,6783.409,6785.178,So that the other P.B.,186,,
990,0.97,6785.178,6786.513,Groups know who they are.,186,,
991,0.97,6786.513,6787.814,Very light lift.,186,,
992,0.97,6787.814,6791.784,In terms of the key supports that I do want to make sure we highlight.,186,,
993,0.97,6791.784,6799.325,"Again, it is really like an administrative and particularly financial management support compliance kind of role.",186,,
994,0.97,6799.325,6799.759,Technical support.,186,,
995,0.97,6799.759,6813.339,"One good example is the steering committee might say, Hey, I'd love to talk to who served on the steering committee last time and ask thou they preserved this particular conflict.",186,,
996,0.97,6813.339,6820.68,"The city leaders are likely to have a record that says, who served and what their contact is.",186,,
997,0.97,6820.68,6824.25,Versus community having to put identity a mass call or ask around.,186,,
998,0.97,6824.25,6825.852,At the bottom of this page.,187,,
999,0.97,6825.852,6832.358,I want to highlight what I was talking about before about the two city project managers.,187,,
1000,0.97,6832.358,6838.498,What we are imagine suggest they are going to keep things.,187,,
1001,0.97,6838.498,6846.94,"Sometimes when we are used to doing things a particular way, and this is not just government life, it is family life and everything.",187,,
1002,0.97,6846.94,6851.211,"When we're used to doing things a particular way, it's hard to do it differently.",187,,
1003,0.97,6851.211,6861.054,So these two people would make it could be and stay Community- led.,187,,
1004,0.97,6861.054,6863.022,"Ideally, they would be recognized in community.",187,,
1005,0.97,6863.022,6865.725,"But in practice, we'll see what actually happens.",187,,
1006,0.97,6865.725,6872.565,"We do think that these people who are Coleading in this city, really should be recognized.",187,,
1007,0.97,6872.565,6874.4,For like tangible benefits to community.,187,,
1008,0.97,6874.4,6882.475,So these are people who are not just saying they're skilled at addressing institutional racism.,187,,
1009,0.97,6882.475,6883.509,But have had success there.,187,,
1010,0.97,6883.509,6888.915,"And when we've interviewed people to talk about what this looks like, honestly, what it usually looks like.",187,,
1011,0.97,6888.915,6891.784,And you city workers can laugh along with this.,187,,
1012,0.97,6891.784,6893.553,It looks like stopping bad ideas.,187,,
1013,0.97,6893.553,6895.855,Like it looks like someone wanted to do a thing.,187,,
1014,0.97,6895.855,6896.789,"And then you're like, Nope.",187,,
1015,0.97,6896.789,6899.926,This is terrible.,187,,
1016,0.97,6899.926,6905.298,"So you know, it's not always work that you're celebrated for.",187,,
1017,0.97,6905.298,6905.932,It's often uncomfortable work.,187,,
1018,0.97,6905.932,6911.604,And you might have colleagues that are giving you the side eye.,187,,
1019,0.97,6911.604,6913.973,But if it's in the community benefits that is key.,187,,
1020,0.97,6913.973,6917.744,And this is an opportunity to really recognize and celebrate those workers.,187,,
1021,0.97,6917.744,6920.847,"We imagine again, that the I.D.T.",187,,
1022,0.97,6920.847,6926.185,"That they would be working with, the interdepartmental team, would identify a core teammate.",187,,
1023,0.97,6926.185,6929.956,"So it's not just a bunch of people showing up, going, what do I do?",187,,
1024,0.97,6929.956,6934.794,But a core team that would focus on those matters.,187,,
1025,0.97,6934.794,6936.496,"Education, subject matter, expertise.",187,,
1026,0.97,6936.496,6936.896,That makes sense.,187,,
1027,0.97,6936.896,6940.633,They provide questions for the teams.,187,,
1028,0.97,6940.633,6941.901,Implementation team.,187,,
1029,0.97,6941.901,6945.004,They make sure everything things actually happen.,187,,
1030,0.97,6945.004,6946.105,And then accountability team.,187,,
1031,0.97,6946.105,6950.276,Making sure things get resolved and not just left hanging.,187,,
1032,0.97,6950.276,6951.21,So I'm really excited.,187,,
1033,0.97,6951.21,6953.246,"Because again, we've talked to several people.",187,,
1034,0.97,6953.246,6958.985,"People who are outside of the departments that we have listed as well, about what this could look like.",187,,
1035,0.97,6958.985,6967.86,People who worked in District Attorney government for decades and have seen several administrations and several changing city council.,187,,
1036,0.97,6967.86,6972.565,"And really refined like what this could really mean, in order to be successful.",187,,
1037,0.97,6972.565,6982.041,And I think that my sense is that I'm really encouraged by the fact that the city seems to be moving in the direction of actually following the community's lead.,187,,
1038,0.97,6982.041,6982.709,And that's really exciting.,187,,
1039,0.97,6982.709,6985.611,And really welcome.,187,,
1040,0.97,6985.611,6986.746,"Thank you, Shaun.",188,,
1041,0.97,6986.746,6990.083,I am going to see if I have any questions from my colleagues.,188,,
1042,0.97,6990.083,6998.324,I don't see any hands raised in the chat.,188,,
1043,0.97,6998.324,7004.063,We want to have--yes.,188,,
1044,0.97,7004.063,7004.764,Councilmember Pedersen.,188,,
1045,0.97,7004.764,7007.667,"Thank you, chair Morales.",189,,
1046,0.97,7007.667,7009.836,Thanks everybody for being here today.,189,,
1047,0.97,7009.836,7014.107,I really appreciate and support the opening remarks of Shaun glaze and her team.,189,,
1048,0.97,7014.107,7023.416,And government at all levels needs to do a much better job at engaging and empowering those impacted by how we allocate tax dollars and make policy decisions.,189,,
1049,0.97,7023.416,7031.257,And this is especially important for those who have been negatively impacted by those government decisions again and again.,189,,
1050,0.97,7031.257,7033.86,And the historical harms have to be corrected.,189,,
1051,0.97,7033.86,7037.83,And there's wisdom in the communities that lived experience for those solutions.,189,,
1052,0.97,7037.83,7044.904,"So thank you for all the work from your teams and all the research participants, too.",189,,
1053,0.97,7044.904,7049.042,And for laying out the Participatory budgeting process going forward for us.,189,,
1054,0.97,7049.042,7056.749,I'm glad to see that participants are identifying housing and economic development and mental health and children and youth.,189,,
1055,0.97,7056.749,7059.786,"You know, we know government has already has some good programs.",189,,
1056,0.97,7059.786,7068.594,"But they need to be expanded, better targeted, not Tone-Deaf to what the needs are in the community.",189,,
1057,0.97,7068.594,7080.973,"And I hear, you know, you and the participants calling for less reliance on those traditional and harmful, interventions that have become so dominant in the criminal justice system.",189,,
1058,0.97,7080.973,7090.216,"I think my questions are more toward, it might be city council central staff just for process.",189,,
1059,0.97,7090.216,7093.719,"Councilmembers, we were asked to submit questions.",189,,
1060,0.97,7093.719,7098.925,"And there were some questions, a lot of questions submitted and answers provided.",189,,
1061,0.97,7098.925,7103.129,I'm wondering if those are going to be put Online eventually.,189,,
1062,0.97,7103.129,7106.999,I heard that they might be put Online.,189,,
1063,0.97,7106.999,7108.234,For the record.,189,,
1064,0.97,7108.234,7109.702,So that would be good.,189,,
1065,0.97,7109.702,7111.437,The Q & amp; a.,189,,
1066,0.97,7111.437,7115.007,"Pointing us to the document, where to look.",189,,
1067,0.97,7115.007,7119.545,"And I had submitted four questions, three weeks ago.",189,,
1068,0.97,7119.545,7125.084,"And thank you, chair Morales, for acknowledging that Council briefing.",189,,
1069,0.97,7125.084,7125.651,I submitted those on time.,189,,
1070,0.97,7125.651,7128.721,And I didn't see my questions listed in an internal list.,189,,
1071,0.97,7128.721,7135.228,I just wanted to make sure that they get published for the record.,189,,
1072,0.97,7135.228,7137.029,"Happy to summarize them now, if that's helpful?",189,,
1073,0.97,7137.029,7137.83,That would be great.,190,,
1074,0.97,7137.83,7139.832,We want all of your questions.,190,,
1075,0.97,7139.832,7140.7,I know.,191,,
1076,0.97,7140.7,7142.602,We had a table.,191,,
1077,0.97,7142.602,7143.136,There? ren't?,191,,
1078,0.97,7143.136,7145.137,"If they're not in the table, good.",192,,
1079,0.97,7145.137,7146.539,Let's get them there.,192,,
1080,0.97,7146.539,7151.177,Let's add them.,193,,
1081,0.97,7151.177,7157.416,"We use everyone's questions, even the public's questions, to do Teach-Ins.",194,,
1082,0.97,7157.416,7159.285,"So literally, can you ask anything.",194,,
1083,0.97,7159.285,7161.654,What have you got.,194,,
1084,0.97,7161.654,7162.522,Thank you.,195,,
1085,0.97,7162.522,7166.459,These don't all have to be answered in Realtime now.,195,,
1086,0.97,7166.459,7172.198,"It could be something where folks get back to us, or both, whatever is easier.",195,,
1087,0.97,7172.198,7178.804,"One question was, we talked a little bit about interacting with executive departments and city government.",195,,
1088,0.97,7178.804,7196.122,My question is about how can we be helpful as Councilmembers to encourage the collaboration with the Mayor's equitable communities initiative?,195,,
1089,0.97,7196.122,7200.76,Her task force has 25 or so experienced caring Stakeholders in this area.,195,,
1090,0.97,7200.76,7206.933,So it would be great to see that to leverage those experiences as well.,195,,
1091,0.97,7206.933,7211.938,Some people have been working on police reform for decades.,195,,
1092,0.97,7211.938,7218.411,"And you know, frustrated with the progress but also proud of some of the achievements, too.",195,,
1093,0.97,7218.411,7220.046,So that's one question coordinating with that group.,195,,
1094,0.97,7220.046,7225.151,"And I realize, it takes two to tango.",195,,
1095,0.97,7225.151,7230.456,So just want to know how we can be supportive of that.,195,,
1096,0.97,7230.456,7231.157,The participants.,195,,
1097,0.97,7231.157,7233.826,I know I struggled with this.,195,,
1098,0.97,7233.826,7236.963,"So my district, everybody's district has 100,000 or so people in it.",195,,
1099,0.97,7236.963,7245.471,"And so, as we try to represent them, I struggle with, you know, when I speak, what does my district want?",195,,
1100,0.97,7245.471,7250.843,I've got such a diverse array of opinions for my constituents?,195,,
1101,0.97,7250.843,7256.749,"And so it's hard for me sometimes to say, you know, what does my district definitely want?",195,,
1102,0.97,7256.749,7259.752,I have to synthesize these opinions and try to do my best.,195,,
1103,0.97,7259.752,7265.391,"And I hesitate to you know, speak for community and so.",195,,
1104,0.97,7265.391,7270.496,"I'm wondering, you know, your participants who are actively engaged, you can give us an idea.",195,,
1105,0.97,7270.496,7272.131,Doesn't have to be now.,195,,
1106,0.97,7272.131,7289.482,"But sort of the number of people you're talking to so that we see sort of what is the sample size of folks you're talking to, to see how statistically, it might represent a larger community that you're trying to engage with.",195,,
1107,0.97,7289.482,7295.321,So just getting some of the numbers there.,195,,
1108,0.97,7295.321,7295.988,Uh-huh.,196,,
1109,0.97,7295.988,7304.23,"The Participatory budgeting process you outlined, I thought was very creative in how you were trying to--you know, the jury selection.",197,,
1110,0.97,7304.23,7311.037,And that in terms of randomly selecting people to lean into it and give more information.,197,,
1111,0.97,7311.037,7314.84,I'm curious as to what--this all sounds like a good idea to me.,197,,
1112,0.97,7314.84,7322.581,"But I'm curious as to what--how that's--do any of these, other communities have tried this, too, I believe?",197,,
1113,0.97,7322.581,7325.117,Maybe not at this level or as cutting edge.,197,,
1114,0.97,7325.117,7330.456,But just knowing what are those national best practices for Participatory budgeting?,197,,
1115,0.97,7330.456,7332.992,Are you sort ever making use of those as well?,197,,
1116,0.97,7332.992,7333.292,Uh-huh.,198,,
1117,0.97,7333.292,7342.735,"And the last thing is, you know, we talked about the housing mental health.",199,,
1118,0.97,7342.735,7343.636,Children and youth.,199,,
1119,0.97,7343.636,7353.779,"I know worst things we're eager to do is to, as we set up a new--as we enhance the 911 system.",199,,
1120,0.97,7353.779,7354.78,And start dispatching.,199,,
1121,0.97,7354.78,7357.083,Not always dispatching officers with guns.,199,,
1122,0.97,7357.083,7361.487,But dispatching mental health providers and others in mental situations.,199,,
1123,0.97,7361.487,7372.398,"Will there be a deeper dive on those types of sort of crisis interventions, where it's like, people call 911 and somebody else might show up.",199,,
1124,0.97,7372.398,7377.97,"Because some of these are more upstream solutions, which we need, to invest in.",199,,
1125,0.97,7377.97,7385.811,But just wondering if there would be also that crisis intervention Oovments as well in a 911-Type situation.,199,,
1126,0.97,7385.811,7387.279,So those are my four questions.,199,,
1127,0.97,7387.279,7391.584,I appreciate your grace in letting me get those out there.,199,,
1128,0.97,7391.584,7392.752,"Oh, no.",200,,
1129,0.97,7392.752,7394.32,It's not grace.,200,,
1130,0.97,7394.32,7394.887,It's excitement.,200,,
1131,0.97,7394.887,7395.588,Given your questions.,200,,
1132,0.97,7395.588,7396.021,We're researchers.,200,,
1133,0.97,7396.021,7396.655,We love your questions.,200,,
1134,0.97,7396.655,7398.624,I can take a stab at some of it.,201,,
1135,0.97,7398.624,7400.693,I'm going to start with your last question.,201,,
1136,0.97,7400.693,7406.332,So we do have a crisis and wellness section bucket.,201,,
1137,0.97,7406.332,7411.003,And a lot of discussion in the programs that are already existing.,201,,
1138,0.97,7411.003,7414.74,"A lot of them just need some, you know, capacity.",201,,
1139,0.97,7414.74,7435.594,And so one of the interesting things is we also have the--it was $12 million that was going through H SD for capacity around programs that provide safety.,201,,
1140,0.97,7435.594,7446.439,"Alternatives to early community safety programming, as well as Scaling up things that help to address those upstream issues as you mentioned but that's definitely the crisis.",201,,
1141,0.97,7446.439,7469.395,"And that's where you'll find the deeper dive on what it looks like to have different people showing up far as basically making sure that whatever, I don't know if it will be 911 or a different number we're trying to make sure through the research that it is clear.",201,,
1142,0.97,7469.395,7471.897,There are programs that are existing.,201,,
1143,0.97,7471.897,7474.5,And ideas for new programs that are clear.,201,,
1144,0.97,7474.5,7475.901,That just need funding.,201,,
1145,0.97,7475.901,7480.506,And support.,201,,
1146,0.97,7480.506,7482.708,Does that answer that question?,201,,
1147,0.97,7482.708,7484.543,I can actually answer a little more.,202,,
1148,0.97,7484.543,7491.484,"For that one, one of the questions we did see that came through was just like, what about cahoots?",202,,
1149,0.97,7491.484,7493.018,Like what about cahoots?,202,,
1150,0.97,7493.018,7494.22,Tell me about cahoots?,202,,
1151,0.97,7494.22,7495.488,Do people want cahoots?,202,,
1152,0.97,7495.488,7509.802,And what I will say is that what people really want is to put as many of our crisis and wellness investments that we make towards like little projects that aren't necessarily a city worker response to it.,202,,
1153,0.97,7509.802,7511.704,That that community is responding to it.,202,,
1154,0.97,7511.704,7515.407,"People also talked about the idea of, they've call today different things.",202,,
1155,0.97,7515.407,7522.014,But it's this idea of almost like 100 different pilots of how we do community safety.,202,,
1156,0.97,7522.014,7526.619,And like what is my wife doing over there.,202,,
1157,0.97,7526.619,7526.986,Photo bombing.,202,,
1158,0.97,7526.986,7527.82,She was dancing earlier.,203,,
1159,0.97,7527.82,7531.524,Oh.,204,,
1160,0.97,7531.524,7532.324,"She's like, your presentation.",204,,
1161,0.97,7532.324,7533.893,I'll get to see you again.,204,,
1162,0.97,7533.893,7537.83,What that looks like is we have so many people we talk to.,205,,
1163,0.97,7537.83,7540.933,I actually run like a secret Hotline.,205,,
1164,0.97,7540.933,7543.802,Or I actually do relational health classes.,205,,
1165,0.97,7543.802,7545.771,Or I do mental health first aid classes.,205,,
1166,0.97,7545.771,7547.84,And like this is the thing I do.,205,,
1167,0.97,7547.84,7551.143,"No one else, like outside of Maybe that vicinity knows about it.",205,,
1168,0.97,7551.143,7560.886,"But there are many people that are like, I really wish there was an easy way, like an App or phone number for me to find these alternatives because I don't want to call the police.",205,,
1169,0.97,7560.886,7563.289,Because they don't feel safe with the police.,205,,
1170,0.97,7563.289,7566.592,And I feel like I don't know what my alternatives are.,205,,
1171,0.97,7566.592,7579.605,"One of the exciting wins that came out of last year's budget cycle was there to be a creation of this App, which communities are also saying should also be Vfltded or tied to some type of Hotline.",205,,
1172,0.97,7579.605,7586.378,We're still trying to figure out what exactly they mean by that.,205,,
1173,0.97,7586.378,7591.45,"Most common example people have is, you know have you to 211 or 411.",205,,
1174,0.97,7591.45,7596.055,"They are like, we should have 111.",205,,
1175,0.97,7596.055,7599.425,"But Yeah, I hear you.",205,,
1176,0.97,7599.425,7601.994,Easy number tied to this application.,205,,
1177,0.97,7601.994,7603.095,Where you can see.,205,,
1178,0.97,7603.095,7604.997,I hear my neighbor arguing.,205,,
1179,0.97,7604.997,7606.966,I don't know what to do.,205,,
1180,0.97,7606.966,7613.639,My phone is telling me I have an option.,205,,
1181,0.97,7613.639,7619.578,Maybe we have a marriage person.,205,,
1182,0.97,7619.578,7621.447,"A media person, someone kill skilled in heated arguments.",205,,
1183,0.97,7621.447,7623.682,Just knowing where to go for information.,205,,
1184,0.97,7623.682,7629.321,And we also hear a lot about what Latanya said.,205,,
1185,0.97,7629.321,7646.839,"Just the idea for many small investments to scale up the existing programs so we can really see, just have are in people skilled at providing safety and help themselves, so we don't have to, say, pour as many resources into a program that people still might not trust.",205,,
1186,0.97,7646.839,7649.475,Because it will still be like a city response.,205,,
1187,0.97,7649.475,7650.109,You know.,205,,
1188,0.97,7650.109,7654.48,"And people have been like, you have been messing this up for decades.",205,,
1189,0.97,7654.48,7661.954,Why should I trust that somehow you have managed to undo all of institutional racism in a year?,205,,
1190,0.97,7661.954,7664.623,Like that doesn't sound like a Fay thing to expect.,205,,
1191,0.97,7664.623,7665.424,That's the thing.,205,,
1192,0.97,7665.424,7673.432,And we do see strong community support for there being something better than what we currently there V in terms of the city's response.,205,,
1193,0.97,7673.432,7677.102,People are happy to hear that there will be a new 911 system.,205,,
1194,0.97,7677.102,7681.306,They're curious to know how soon we can start to integrate that.,205,,
1195,0.97,7681.306,7683.409,Into all of these little alternatives.,205,,
1196,0.97,7683.409,7686.645,And they're really hoping that that's the direction.,205,,
1197,0.97,7686.645,7692.051,"There were other things you had, that I feel like we did have answered in the report themselves.",205,,
1198,0.97,7692.051,7695.12,I'm going to take two of them.,206,,
1199,0.97,7695.12,7695.521,If that's okay.,206,,
1200,0.97,7695.521,7699.892,You asked about jury selection process.,206,,
1201,0.97,7699.892,7704.129,And how we are engaging with the equitable communities task force.,206,,
1202,0.97,7704.129,7713.038,"I will say that throughout this last several months, we have been meeting fairly regularly with the PB national organization.",206,,
1203,0.97,7713.038,7733.826,"They were just on a call with us this week, with deputy Mayor Washington, director noble, to talk about, you know, what this process is, how it's worked in other communities, the kinds of projects that have been funded in other communities.",206,,
1204,0.97,7733.826,7743.035,"So we are really engaged with--and I say ""We ."" I should say, the researchers have been really engaged as they're looking at how to set this up.",206,,
1205,0.97,7743.035,7747.539,And what has been successful in other communities.,206,,
1206,0.97,7747.539,7752.311,"And then we are also, as they mentioned this afternoon, I won't be there.",206,,
1207,0.97,7752.311,7754.279,My staff will be there.,206,,
1208,0.97,7754.279,7762.755,Meeting with the executive again to talk about what the process is that has been happening with equitable communities task force.,206,,
1209,0.97,7762.755,7775.601,"And how we can align these two processes, you know, I don't know if in the end, we will have one pot of Participatory budget money.",206,,
1210,0.97,7775.601,7777.903,Or how these processes will intersect.,206,,
1211,0.97,7777.903,7785.978,"But we are definitely talking about making sure that we are reaching towards the same goals, so that we're not working at cross-purposes.",206,,
1212,0.97,7785.978,7794.419,And not sort of Duplicating effort or Duplicating work that really doesn't need to be happening.,206,,
1213,0.97,7794.419,7796.655,On parallel tracks.,206,,
1214,0.97,7796.655,7801.894,"Does that not answer your question, Councilmember Pedersen?",206,,
1215,0.97,7801.894,7802.127,Yes.,207,,
1216,0.97,7802.127,7806.932,"Also, I would love to add their pot to the P.B.",208,,
1217,0.97,7806.932,7807.299,Pot.,208,,
1218,0.97,7807.299,7808.433,Make a bigger P.B.,208,,
1219,0.97,7808.433,7808.667,Pot.,208,,
1220,0.97,7808.667,7815.807,"And I think community, too, would also love that and integrate them into the work that we're doing.",208,,
1221,0.97,7815.807,7822.047,"So are there any other questions, colleagues?",209,,
1222,0.97,7822.047,7834.259,"So the last thing I'll say is, you know, there have been a lot of people working hard to make sure that we are getting these processes in motion.",209,,
1223,0.97,7834.259,7839.398,"The next step, Amy, I see you on the line from central staff.",209,,
1224,0.97,7839.398,7841.6,You can confirm if I'm Misspeaking here.,209,,
1225,0.97,7841.6,7848.574,But the next step for us will be to lift the proviso for this funding.,209,,
1226,0.97,7848.574,7849.908,My next committee meeting is March 16th.,209,,
1227,0.97,7849.908,7865.691,"So we are working now to get the implementation plan, the spending plan finalized so that we can finalize and draft that at the next committee meeting.",209,,
1228,0.97,7865.691,7867.926,"Is that accurate, Amy?",209,,
1229,0.97,7867.926,7868.393,So Yeah.,209,,
1230,0.97,7868.393,7874.867,I think this is a really exciting opportunity to increase civic engagement.,209,,
1231,0.97,7874.867,7878.804,To really shift some power for decision-making to our neighbors.,209,,
1232,0.97,7878.804,7887.112,And I believe it's an important step for us as a city to begin to repair the harm done to black and Brown communities.,209,,
1233,0.97,7887.112,7893.585,And I'm just really excited about the opportunity to keep moving this forward.,209,,
1234,0.97,7893.585,7901.226,"Thank you, everyone, for the work that you have been doing, for your engagement with community and sharing all that you've learned.",209,,
1235,0.97,7901.226,7905.731,"If there are no other comments, or questions?",209,,
1236,0.97,7905.731,7907.232,Okay.,209,,
1237,0.97,7907.232,7910.636,This committee is adjourned.,209,,
1238,0.97,7910.636,7912.838,"Thanks so much, everyone.",209,,
1239,0.97,7912.838,7915.14,Have a good afternoon!,209,,
