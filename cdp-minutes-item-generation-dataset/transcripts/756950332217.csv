96,0.97,370.47,381.514,An earth shattering moment that shook politicians awake to make the same commitments to police accountability that were only to be recycled three years later after George Floyd.,37,,

104,0.97,443.476,453.352,You founded a rental housing study and a Stakeholder group last fall and it has been too overwhelmed to even get started yet.,39,,
105,0.97,453.352,465.031,"Numerous grassroots landlords have spoken in opposition, only to be landlocked by the chair of the Renters rights Committee, who described our constructive input as Facetious, making no sense, speculative, and unfounded.",39,,

122,0.97,550.683,557.857,"The local sharing economy, which is a source of crucial learning opportunities for many in Seattle.",43,,
123,0.97,557.857,563.129,"This measure is being considered without, and prior to any effort from the city the study the impacts.",43,,
124,0.97,563.129,571.571,"Including the real possibility that it diminishes the flexible learning opportunities for workers, as well as the number of delivery orders from local stores.",43,,
125,0.97,571.571,583.015,"Flexibility is at the core of our effort based approach, many shoppers use our platform as a way to earn side income while ensuring they have time to pursue the things they value in life.",43,,
126,0.97,583.015,587.42,To this end 75% of our shoppers choose to work less than 10 hours per week per shift.,43,,
127,0.97,587.42,592.925,"Some work more than 40 hours a week and earn on average more than $67,000 a year.",43,,

133,0.97,611.777,620.453,We are here today opposed to the payoff ordinance.,45,,
134,0.97,620.453,621.921,Door dash has supported minimum earning standards before.,45,,
135,0.97,621.921,630.529,"But the PAYOUT proposal calculated that 189% of Seattle's minimum wage, behold for tips, for an average delivery, is just too high.",45,,
136,0.97,630.529,638.571,"It will raise costs on customers by up to five dollars, reduce orders from merchants, and shrink earning opportunities for dashes.",45,,
137,0.97,638.571,641.907,This is a policy in search of a problem.,45,,
138,0.97,641.907,648.247,"Dancers in Seattle already earn, on average, $28 an hour on delivery.",45,,
139,0.97,648.247,658.524,"Finally, door dash has heard from more than 16,000 of your constituents, who have submitted letters, asking you to halt the proposal and study its impacts before passing it.",45,,
140,0.97,658.524,673.072,We ask that the Council--and better understand the impact of this proposal before passing it today.,45,,
141,0.97,673.072,676.242,Thank you.,45,,
142,0.97,676.242,679.245,Richard is the next Speaker.,46,,

144,0.97,691.023,703.702,"I have full control over my rates, which I believe are fair, for the services I provide.",47,,
145,0.97,703.702,709.442,I want to share a common today to express gratitude to the public safety and human services committee for passing amendment two and three on May 24th.,47,,
146,0.97,709.442,714.747,"These amendments protect me and other service providers from burdensome regulations, which does not reflect the type of service we provide and would not have benefited us.",47,,
147,0.97,714.747,721.754,I'm relieved the is meant men's were passed and I encourage you to vote yes to the bill as amended last week.,47,,
148,0.97,721.754,732.631,Thank you for understanding how this bill would have hurt pet sitters in responding to the call to change it.,47,,
149,0.97,732.631,735.668,Next Speaker.,48,,
150,0.97,735.668,741.874,Hello.,49,,
151,0.97,741.874,742.708,I am an Instacart shopper.,49,,
152,0.97,742.708,745.878,I'm Testifying in support of the payable policy and ask that you pass it.,49,,
153,0.97,745.878,753.152,We get in adversarial relationship with the gig companies.,49,,
154,0.97,753.152,756.689,"We appreciate the opportunity they have provided and we share a common goal, serving the people of Seattle.",49,,
155,0.97,756.689,760.326,I would love it if we lived in a world where businesses always did the right thing.,49,,
156,0.97,760.326,766.132,But the reality is that gig companies continue to pay the lowest amount possible unless you pass pay up today.,49,,
157,0.97,766.132,772.204,We workers earn less than a minimum wage and exist off of tips.,49,,
158,0.97,772.204,777.109,Customers pay generous tips and fees and are unaware of how much they are actually contributing.,49,,
159,0.97,777.109,782.281,"Grocery stores and restaurants pay, when using the third-party App.",49,,
160,0.97,782.281,783.716,At the gig companies do not pay.,49,,
161,0.97,783.716,788.254,They do not pay the Seattle minimum wage 1727 before tip.,49,,
162,0.97,788.254,799.098,It's the responsibility of gig companies to pay a fair wage and to do so without raging and retaliating against workers.,49,,
163,0.97,799.098,803.068,I urge you to pass the pay up today.,49,,
164,0.97,803.068,804.503,Thank you.,49,,
165,0.97,804.503,808.174,Our next Speaker is Charlotte Thistle.,50,,
166,0.97,808.174,815.247,I'm a Homeowner who has provided affordable rental housing in my home for 15 years in Seattle and I'm leaving.,51,,
167,0.97,815.247,824.456,"I'm leaving because the city of Seattle has taken a hostile stance to people like me, who provide a naturally affordable housing.",51,,
168,0.97,824.456,830.796,I'm going to sell my house and I'm going to move to Portland Oregon.,51,,
169,0.97,830.796,836.735,"Portland has rental regulations too but their rules are a lot more reasonable and they have exemptions for homeowners, including homeowners with a Dus.",51,,
170,0.97,836.735,846.946,This will a compass with--this approach will not yield quality data.,51,,
171,0.97,846.946,851.15,There's just more red tape.,51,,
172,0.97,851.15,860.593,It is piled onto small housing providers who are already carrying the weight of a stunning 15 new pieces of legislation Impacting us in just the last five years.,51,,
173,0.97,860.593,866.332,This bill will not promote affordable housing.,51,,
174,0.97,866.332,871.036,All it will do is appear to cater to tenants interests without affecting any positive change.,51,,
175,0.97,871.036,873.572,Vote no.,51,,
176,0.97,873.572,875.474,Our next Speaker is Britney.,52,,

181,0.97,897.696,904.436,"Our members have provided you with evidence that their workers earn, on average, a wage of $25- $30 an hour.",53,,
182,0.97,904.436,915.281,"However with the proposed risk regulations, will likely result in a reduced demand for services in Seattle and reduce business earnings.",53,,
183,0.97,915.281,924.957,Without a thorough assessment across the county we cannot support this legislation.,53,,
184,0.97,924.957,931.063,A statewide regulation would avoid creating winners and losers for both drivers and local businesses.,53,,
185,0.97,931.063,938.671,-- demonstrates this goal can be met without disrupting workers and local businesses.,53,,

189,0.97,959.291,963.295,It's not a collaborative approach for small housing providers.,54,,
190,0.97,963.295,965.464,This bill will not accomplish its goals and create worse regulations.,54,,
191,0.97,965.464,970.569,This is a blatant overreach of governmental power.,54,,
192,0.97,970.569,978.977,It pushes mom and pop providers out of the market and it's a direct reflection of policy decisions this capital has made.,54,,
193,0.97,978.977,991.457,This is a preliminary step in in an attempt to pass --,54,,
194,0.97,1039.438,1041.607,"Jennifer, we will come back to you.",55,,
195,0.97,1041.607,1047.613,"There you go, Jennifer.",55,,

201,0.97,1064.363,1070.602,I'm a second generation housing provider.,58,,
202,0.97,1070.602,1081.013,I own and manage 15 housing units . They are made up of single family homes and Duplessis.,58,,

204,0.97,1083.282,1087.119,What you're asking for is--agreement between the residents and myself.,58,,
205,0.97,1087.119,1099.498,"Even if I had access to my utility information, which I do not, they do not want this information or any data on their personal living habits and decisions given to the public or used in a study.",58,,
206,0.97,1099.498,1107.105,"The amount they pay, the space they have chosen to rent, the utility usage, et cetera, this is private information.",58,,
207,0.97,1107.105,1110.342,They have a right to it remaining private.,58,,
208,0.97,1110.342,1116.949,The fact that you say data will be analyzed by an unspecified school group is unsettling.,58,,
209,0.97,1116.949,1120.052,A professional policy organization has more experience keeping private information safe and free of data leaks.,58,,
210,0.97,1120.052,1123.722,Think you for your time.,58,,
211,0.97,1123.722,1128.627,The next Speaker is magnolia.,59,,

215,0.97,1152.818,1156.188,"All workers deserve a living wage, whether it's working in Tech, medicine, or the gig economy.",60,,
216,0.97,1156.188,1161.026,"There are currently no protections in place in Seattle that ensure that gig workers are paid minimum wage, much less the living wage.",60,,
217,0.97,1161.026,1163.328,Many workers providing services are paid far below what we should be.,60,,
218,0.97,1163.328,1168.634,"Even before paying taxes and the cost of services, like car maintenance, is not nearly enough to pay for rent and food in the city.",60,,
219,0.97,1168.634,1170.569,We are working overtime and putting ourselves into dangerous situations.,60,,
220,0.97,1170.569,1172.704,Meanwhile others are reporting huge profits.,60,,
221,0.97,1172.704,1176.842,Profits in spite of the workers not making decent wages.,60,,

228,0.97,1202.568,1211.109,We have been involved in this process since Councilmember Herbold shared her intent to introduce this legislation 11 months ago.,62,,
229,0.97,1211.109,1218.884,Admittedly we have come a long way since the beginning but the proposal remains extremely problematic for everyone on the platforms.,62,,
230,0.97,1218.884,1232.931,"We expect an increase in cost for consumers, which in turn means a decrease in command for services offered on the platform and a decrease in earnings for shoppers.",62,,
231,0.97,1232.931,1235.067,This is a necessity for countless unseen customers in Seattle.,62,,
232,0.97,1235.067,1241.406,"While we appreciate the committees adoption last week, these amendments do not go far enough.",62,,
233,0.97,1241.406,1242.341,Grocery is different.,62,,
234,0.97,1242.341,1248.981,Shoppers on our platform need food and essentials.,62,,
235,0.97,1248.981,1253.919,"Customers are often unable to shop on their own for a variety of reasons, including lack of transportation, illness, disability, and more.",62,,
236,0.97,1253.919,1258.423,This ordinance will have an unintended harmful consequence.,62,,

252,0.97,1415.881,1419.818,Every six months is a tremendous burden for a small landlord like me.,68,,
253,0.97,1419.818,1429.828,I have to complete a report frequently and come up with all kinds of different bits of information about the property.,68,,

255,0.97,1435.967,1439.638,We are losing rental units as a result.,68,,
256,0.97,1439.638,1442.14,This is not what works in the best interest of anyone.,68,,
257,0.97,1442.14,1451.95,You heard one landlord earlier today speaking about how there is a plan to move property in Seattle out-of-state.,68,,

352,0.97,1869.267,1878.776,You have to be super Delusionary to steal more money from us.,90,,
353,0.97,1878.776,1888.92,You stole so much that you're now addicted . What are you going to reap from further delaying the payment policy?,90,,
354,0.97,1888.92,1917.215,"I know, more money for the on needy, greedy folks instead of the immediate needs of drivers who need more as prices are climbing higher and higher . You will push us to the edge into the black hole of debt and despair.",90,,

360,0.97,1949.514,1953.818,This will play an unnecessary burden on every housing provider in the city to provide private information for the city's purposes.,92,,
361,0.97,1953.818,1965.797,According to a memo received by the city council mandatory Data- gathering often result in inaccurate and unreliable data.,92,,
362,0.97,1965.797,1971.035,"Furthermore, involving the city and private contracts between two consenting individuals is the violation of the privacy of the housing provider and tenant.",92,,
363,0.97,1971.035,1979.51,We have continually expressed desire to work with the city to improve the market.,92,,

365,0.97,1983.047,1998.396,"Additionally, Council members, we are concerned that this data will be used to push an Anti- density agenda and there are better ways to go about collecting data that involve Partnering with the industry instead of mandatory participation.",92,,
366,0.97,1998.396,1999.063,Thank you.,92,,
367,0.97,1999.063,2007.038,Our next Speaker.,93,,
368,0.97,2007.038,2008.84,Good afternoon.,94,,
369,0.97,2008.84,2019.517,I am a former delivery driver for Uber.,94,,
370,0.97,2019.517,2021.252,The drawbacks no longer make it worthwhile.,94,,
371,0.97,2021.252,2023.421,The standard fare was already low when I began in 2017.,94,,
372,0.97,2023.421,2025.256,It has effectively been cut with inflation.,94,,
373,0.97,2025.256,2033.631,Uber has recently provided us with an extra $.35 per trip to compensate inflating fuel prices.,94,,
374,0.97,2033.631,2034.565,This gesture is not enough.,94,,
375,0.97,2034.565,2036.234,We need a real mileage cost accounted for.,94,,
376,0.97,2036.234,2037.735,We need mild compensation.,94,,
377,0.97,2037.735,2041.305,Not an arbitrary pay bump by Uber.,94,,
378,0.97,2041.305,2047.945,Many jobs would leave me with only three or four dollars after 30 to 45 minutes.,94,,
379,0.97,2047.945,2059.824,The exact tip amounts on Uber is not visible until after the trip is completed.,94,,
380,0.97,2059.824,2062.96,Requiring the tips to be visible on each trip would save time with no consequences.,94,,
381,0.97,2062.96,2066.764,It would create a pay standard so that we no longer have to guess.,94,,
382,0.97,2066.764,2074.005,-- it is meant to aid us and it is time to make it into law.,94,,
383,0.97,2074.005,2080.178,Our next Speaker is David.,95,,
384,0.97,2080.178,2081.179,My name is David.,96,,
385,0.97,2081.179,2082.713,I'm a small business landlord.,96,,
386,0.97,2082.713,2096.527,I'm also disabled . The new laws that the city are passing are making it very difficult for myself or other small landlords from being able to have businesses here.,96,,
387,0.97,2096.527,2101.599,Please vote no on CB 120325.,96,,
388,0.97,2101.599,2105.436,"Key protections for small business landlord's, such as myself.",96,,
389,0.97,2105.436,2107.071,Thank you.,96,,
390,0.97,2107.071,2111.876,Bye.,96,,
391,0.97,2111.876,2120.518,Our next Speaker has an interpreter.,97,,
392,0.97,2120.518,2127.892,"Were we going to let the interpreter, how are we going to do this?",98,,
393,0.97,2127.892,2129.126,We talked about this.,98,,
394,0.97,2129.126,2143.04,Can we confirm that the interpreter is available?,99,,
395,0.97,2143.04,2153.584,[speaking foreign language],100,,
396,0.97,2189.02,2196.327,No child was left--to help better academic results.,101,,
397,0.97,2196.327,2205.202,Now is the time for the city of Seattle to show essential workers and gig companies that no one is above the law and we deserve to be protected by these laws.,101,,
398,0.97,2205.202,2215.046,This law was assigned to protect everyone and it is not fair that our colleagues are left out from pay up legislation.,101,,
399,0.97,2215.046,2221.886,"City Council members, we ask you to please protect all of us and avoid loopholes for companies to not abuse employees.",101,,
400,0.97,2221.886,2229.961,We have to cover all essential workers.,101,,
401,0.97,2229.961,2230.595,Thank you.,102,,
402,0.97,2230.595,2235.967,Our next Speaker is Kyle Mitchell.,102,,

405,0.97,2243.808,2251.048,The gig workers of Seattle are heroes.,103,,
406,0.97,2251.048,2251.282,Period.,103,,
407,0.97,2251.282,2255.419,"I can attest to the dangers that I take upon myself so that my customers, your citizens, do not have to.",103,,
408,0.97,2255.419,2259.557,"These include traffic dangers, such as unsafe streets due to inclement weather.",103,,
409,0.97,2259.557,2276.941,"Other drivers, who exhibit extreme road rage . drivers who think they own the road and ignore traffic laws, or drivers were not skilled enough to handle driving these streets and make poor choices such as taking a left turn from the right-hand Lane of a three Lane road.",103,,
410,0.97,2276.941,2282.713,Then we get out of our vehicles to make our deliveries and are subject to the dangers of the people of this city.,103,,
411,0.97,2282.713,2284.949,There is a lot of desperation on the streets of Seattle.,103,,
412,0.97,2284.949,2286.617,Desperation causes people to do dangerous things.,103,,
413,0.97,2286.617,2294.025,This is especially true when the sun goes down and we have to constantly be aware of Seattle's Nightlife.,103,,
414,0.97,2294.025,2297.895,Please pass this proposal and back to workers whose labor keeps your citizens safe.,103,,
415,0.97,2297.895,2304.735,Our labor is valuable.,103,,

418,0.97,2314.478,2321.986,Yes.,106,,
419,0.97,2321.986,2325.256,I have worked as a gig driver since 2025.,107,,
420,0.97,2325.256,2327.925,I had no idea what I was facing.,107,,
421,0.97,2327.925,2336.701,I have to put in 70 to 80 hours just to get by and each order only pays me four dollars.,107,,
422,0.97,2336.701,2347.745,That doesn't even cover gas and mileage.,107,,
423,0.97,2347.745,2357.822,Pay up should pass to make sure we can survive . Let this proposal passed . please.,107,,
424,0.97,2357.822,2362.526,Thank you.,107,,

428,0.97,2381.545,2384.081,Hello.,111,,
429,0.97,2384.081,2390.221,"I am a gig worker, primarily with door dash.",111,,
430,0.97,2390.221,2391.956,As well as a member of the PAYOUT campaign.,111,,
431,0.97,2391.956,2395.326,I want to first thank Councilmember Herbold for advocating for gig workers.,111,,
432,0.97,2395.326,2399.93,We appreciate your efforts.,111,,
433,0.97,2399.93,2403.434,"Currently gig workers in Seattle are not making a living wage, relative to the cost of living.",111,,
434,0.97,2403.434,2408.172,It's time for the city Council to rise up and enact a pay floor for us gig workers.,111,,
435,0.97,2408.172,2416.046,"We are in the middle, or the beginning, of a recession.",111,,
436,0.97,2416.046,2418.516,The cost of living has gone up and the pay is not increasing.,111,,
437,0.97,2418.516,2420.384,We are still being paid less than minimum wage.,111,,
438,0.97,2420.384,2434.732,Today I read a news report saying that door dash is removing the fuel subsidies that they enacted in order to help drivers pay for gas during the pandemic.,111,,
439,0.97,2434.732,2439.336,I found out they are removing that extra charge but they are still charging customers money to pay for the fuel subsidy.,111,,
440,0.97,2439.336,2444.942,This amounts to a pay cut in the middle of an economic recession.,111,,
441,0.97,2444.942,2449.313,We need Councilmembers to --,111,,
442,0.97,2449.313,2456.954,Our next Speaker is Carmen.,112,,
443,0.97,2456.954,2458.489,Can you hear me okay?,113,,
444,0.97,2458.489,2466.33,Yes.,114,,
445,0.97,2466.33,2472.937,The PAYOUT policy has been written with the input of thousands of gig workers to be fair and equitable to all parties.,115,,
446,0.97,2472.937,2478.242,The PAYOUT policy takes the first few steps to recognize and respect a gig workers humanity by demanding workers be paid a living wage.,115,,
447,0.97,2478.242,2486.851,Passing the PAP policy will allow me to earn a wage in which I can thrive in society.,115,,
448,0.97,2486.851,2490.921,I'm one of the thousands of people with hidden disabilities that depend on gig work to make a living.,115,,
449,0.97,2490.921,2493.324,They need and deserve to be paid a living wage.,115,,
450,0.97,2493.324,2500.397,Our companies have made millions off of my labor and have no intention of investing in me or any workers.,115,,
451,0.97,2500.397,2505.302,They are actively lobbying for the ability to force workers to work longer and more hours more frequently.,115,,
452,0.97,2505.302,2507.705,While keeping more and more of the profits for themselves.,115,,
453,0.97,2507.705,2518.115,I am trusting the Council to pass this with no loopholes for me and the gig workers in Washington because we are not disposable and should not be exploited.,115,,
454,0.97,2518.115,2522.286,Thank you for your support.,115,,

456,0.97,2526.523,2543.007,"This is Jake . I have driven for these companies, delivery companies, since they first arrived in Seattle in 2015, when the pay was higher and the cost of living was lower.",117,,
457,0.97,2543.007,2553.183,"I'm also a gig worker in other industries that are rapidly being turned into dystopian legal relationships with a workers are not guaranteed a minimum wage, labor rights, benefits, or on-the-job protections.",117,,
458,0.97,2553.183,2562.693,I urge the Council--who have shamefully amended this legislation to let many of these companies off the hook.,117,,
459,0.97,2562.693,2576.874,"These companies, like Rover, that set their own rates and suppress results of our services to customers if we don't follow the company's rising guidance, which is to set our prices under minimum wage.",117,,
460,0.97,2576.874,2586.85,The recent exclusion of thousands of sub minimum wage workers is Stabbing us in the back while we are already being attacked by these companies.,117,,
461,0.97,2586.85,2593.357,We have an opportunity to set labor standards for gig workers and other municipalities can Replicate.,117,,

469,0.97,2628.492,2641.538,"It seems like the city Council, over the last few years, have passed a dozen burden some laws without enough study or research.",119,,
470,0.97,2641.538,2642.706,You've got a lot of data.,119,,
471,0.97,2642.706,2660.991,I like the idea of Partnering with the small housing providers . Maybe there can be an amendment or something to ensure there is proper data.,119,,
472,0.97,2660.991,2664.862,You guys have made a housing crisis into housing chaos.,119,,

487,0.97,2715.112,2719.783,"I drive for a nonprofit organization, representing over 2500 gig workers across Seattle and Washington state.",123,,
488,0.97,2719.783,2731.929,I'm here to ask that the Council actually delay the vote on counsel bill 120294 and continued to work on improving the legislation.,123,,
489,0.97,2731.929,2734.164,It has come a long way but it's not quite ready.,123,,
490,0.97,2734.164,2743.974,We strongly believe that the current method will result in a cap on earnings for gig workers at a minimum wage and nothing more.,123,,
491,0.97,2743.974,2752.583,We proposed an alternative method to calculate the standard that would allow the flexibility and earnings to continue.,123,,
492,0.97,2752.583,2759.857,We urge the Council to slow down on this bill and not pass it yet and consider our proposal.,123,,
493,0.97,2759.857,2772.402,"Additionally, we want to make sure it is understood that we are ready to work on continuing to create a minimum earning standard for all gig workers, including those that have been excluded from this bill.",123,,
494,0.97,2772.402,2776.039,We do believe that needs to be a separate piece of legislation for the marketplace.,123,,
495,0.97,2776.039,2776.94,Thank you.,123,,
496,0.97,2776.94,2779.743,The next Speaker is Aaron.,124,,

499,0.97,2786.316,2791.655,Our coalition includes delivery network companies that provide critical services to the community.,125,,
500,0.97,2791.655,2806.703,"Members have long advocated for minimum earning standards for their industry, like those in California, and a proposed ballot member in Massachusetts that would provide the same benefits for workers.",125,,
501,0.97,2806.703,2809.473,While pay up his Well- intentioned it is poorly drafted.,125,,
502,0.97,2809.473,2817.748,It proposes increased cost without regard for consumers or for the impact on small businesses and ultimately the drivers themselves.,125,,
503,0.97,2817.748,2824.721,If costs for delivery services are arbitrarily driven out of reach through mandatory regulation and then everyone will be hurt.,125,,
504,0.97,2824.721,2831.028,"Including the drivers, who will lose work as consumers choose other options or simply forgo certain services.",125,,
505,0.97,2831.028,2843.173,It is disappointing that the Seattle city Council has rushed to regulations on delivery drivers without understanding what the economic impact is for small businesses and the drivers they claim to help.,125,,

513,0.97,2897.227,2900.03,Some on the Council don't seem to believe that people like me exist.,128,,
514,0.97,2900.03,2902.099,Let me assure you that we do.,128,,
515,0.97,2902.099,2906.003,Even though we are currently and endangered minority.,128,,
516,0.97,2906.003,2914.678,You already know from your own data that Seattle's renting supply is going in the wrong direction.,128,,
517,0.97,2914.678,2916.079,It's dwindling instead of growing.,128,,
518,0.97,2916.079,2917.214,At a growing rate.,128,,
519,0.97,2917.214,2931.828,Instead of spending money that you don't have to find out what you already know how about going to companies like Zillow or red fan and contract with them to provide information that they already have about local rental markets from data that they already have.,128,,
520,0.97,2931.828,2947.044,I'm sure you will get good data from a much larger base . I encourage you to really consider the fact that we are in endangered species and you need us.,128,,
521,0.97,2947.044,2949.313,Thank you.,128,,

533,0.97,2996.827,2999.763,"Often times they are on fixed income with a disability, social security, the retirements.",132,,

535,0.97,3002.766,3006.737,Brent keeps going up and they have no recourse.,132,,
536,0.97,3006.737,3008.538,We need stronger rental protections in this town.,132,,
537,0.97,3008.538,3017.714,"It's heartbreaking to talk to someone who has lived in a unit for five, 10, 15 years, and they can't afford a rent increase.",132,,
538,0.97,3017.714,3019.049,They end up on the street.,132,,
539,0.97,3019.049,3023.253,These are very common sense small steps . I think we should take them.,132,,
540,0.97,3023.253,3028.959,"The people complaining, saying they are small landlords, they can afford to give data.",132,,
541,0.97,3028.959,3032.596,We need this and a lot more.,132,,
542,0.97,3032.596,3037.167,I can't handle this because of unreasonable rent increases.,132,,
543,0.97,3037.167,3040.871,Thank you.,132,,
544,0.97,3040.871,3048.378,Our next Speaker is Ryan Georgie.,133,,
545,0.97,3048.378,3060.657,My name is Ryan and I'm a full-time gig worker for door dash and Uber . I am firmly opposed to this thing.,134,,
546,0.97,3060.657,3061.892,I make very good money.,134,,
547,0.97,3061.892,3070.567,I can make anywhere from $26- $50 an hour sometimes doing this gig work.,134,,
548,0.97,3070.567,3074.671,If this goes through I think it's going to be a disaster for everyone.,134,,
549,0.97,3074.671,3075.939,It's hyper inflationary.,134,,
550,0.97,3075.939,3077.04,It will hurt restaurants.,134,,
551,0.97,3077.04,3087.117,Imagine if you are a restaurant and you are getting charged four dollars more or five dollars more for in order and you have to pass it on to the customer.,134,,
552,0.97,3087.117,3088.285,What will the customers do?,134,,
553,0.97,3088.285,3100.43,They will order food from out of Seattle and that will hurt Seattle businesses . It's bad for everyone.,134,,
554,0.97,3100.43,3107.103,There has been a rumor going around from door dash.,134,,
555,0.97,3107.103,3108.271,We are making plenty of money.,134,,
556,0.97,3108.271,3109.639,They lost $161 million last quarter.,134,,
557,0.97,3109.639,3111.775,They lose every single year.,134,,
558,0.97,3111.775,3113.276,Why do we want to hurt them?,134,,
559,0.97,3113.276,3116.746,We want to help them succeed.,134,,
560,0.97,3116.746,3125.655,Our next Speaker is Kate Rubin.,135,,
561,0.97,3125.655,3126.256,Hello.,136,,
562,0.97,3126.256,3127.123,My name is Kate Rubin.,136,,
563,0.97,3127.123,3135.999,I'm the organizing director of Seattle Renters living in district 2. I'm calling in support of counsel bill 120325.,136,,
564,0.97,3135.999,3139.236,There is already a massive imbalance of power between Renters and landlords.,136,,
565,0.97,3139.236,3154.985,I heard a landlord refer to himself as an endangered minority and it is very Disrespectful . We should know who we are giving thousands of dollars in rent every month.,136,,
566,0.97,3154.985,3164.427,If the data is accurate--we are talking about a few minutes out of their day per year.,136,,
567,0.97,3164.427,3166.596,They are not sharing any identifying information about their tenants.,136,,
568,0.97,3166.596,3172.836,The level of transparency this ordinance creates is a small step toward leveling the playing field and preventing displacement.,136,,
569,0.97,3172.836,3190.287,"Renters can organize so much easier with their neighbors and folks that have properties owned by the same landlord work together to identify whether or not the landlord has a history of rent gouging, not making repairs, retaliation, discrimination, Harassment, or intimidation.",136,,
570,0.97,3190.287,3194.958,Our next caller is BJ.,137,,
571,0.97,3194.958,3200.363,Hello.,138,,
572,0.97,3200.363,3201.164,I'm a Ballard resident.,138,,
573,0.97,3201.164,3205.468,I'm calling in support of the Pip proposal.,138,,
574,0.97,3205.468,3206.57,It should cover all gig workers.,138,,
575,0.97,3206.57,3210.407,All of them have a right to minimum wage.,138,,
576,0.97,3210.407,3223.053,"Council members Pedersen, Nelson, and Lewis--gig companies and excluded a bunch of gig workers from PAYOUT.",138,,

579,0.97,3246.743,3250.48,Hello.,140,,
580,0.97,3250.48,3257.053,I agree with the caller a couple ago that we are going in the wrong direction for rental housing.,140,,
581,0.97,3257.053,3260.39,For a different reason.,140,,
582,0.97,3260.39,3270.3,We have a completely unregulated housing market and the folks that are selling are making a tremendous profit off of rental properties that usually go to tenants.,140,,
583,0.97,3270.3,3281.544,"We need to pass rental history, rental price legislation . We need to not be carving out any workers.",140,,
584,0.97,3281.544,3287.384,It is your job to make sure people are paid what they deserve.,140,,
585,0.97,3287.384,3294.924,You should be more worried about making sure that workers are making a living wage than you are about--rising too much.,140,,
586,0.97,3294.924,3303.4,Let's get in touch with our priorities and get rid of the loopholes in PAYOUT.,140,,
587,0.97,3303.4,3313.71,Our next caller is Doug.,141,,
588,0.97,3313.71,3317.647,Hello.,142,,
589,0.97,3317.647,3325.488,I'm a housing provider in Seattle and I was touched by some earlier phone calls.,142,,
590,0.97,3325.488,3331.828,The cancer survivor reminds me that we are in a state of emergency in this city.,142,,
591,0.97,3331.828,3339.102,"Homelessness is a really tough issue, as are rising housing costs.",142,,
592,0.97,3339.102,3352.649,"Counsel bill 120325 was billed as a displacement ordinance to gather information about displacement . It was heard in the Renters rights committee where it was assured to get one vote, perhaps two.",142,,
593,0.97,3352.649,3358.021,"This is sadly, my opinion, I have read the ordinance, it is an attack on density.",142,,
594,0.97,3358.021,3361.658,I'm a resident of the green Lake committee.,142,,
595,0.97,3361.658,3362.425,I support urban villages.,142,,
596,0.97,3362.425,3363.46,We voted for it.,142,,
597,0.97,3363.46,3365.929,"This is decided on, in my opinion.",142,,
598,0.97,3365.929,3378.408,"I support Councilmember Pedersen's agenda . uptown, Admiral, Ballard, green Lake, we love our density.",142,,
599,0.97,3378.408,3379.976,This is an attack on density.,142,,
600,0.97,3379.976,3384.547,We cannot afford it.,142,,
601,0.97,3384.547,3389.152,Our next Speaker is David Haynes and then we will go back to Kate Martin if she is available.,143,,
602,0.97,3389.152,3390.086,David Haynes?,143,,
603,0.97,3390.086,3393.757,Thank you.,144,,
604,0.97,3393.757,3395.625,District 7. sometimes a small landlords are the worst.,144,,
605,0.97,3395.625,3410.44,"They think they are entitled to pad the cost of their home, forcing Renters to welfare subsidize their mortgage and lifestyle, while never being professional.",144,,
606,0.97,3410.44,3418.448,One of my Girlfriends was forced to carry buckets of water from the kitchen sink to the bathtub after working a full day for Kroger because the shower and bath pipes were fit filled with black and Brown sludge.,144,,
607,0.97,3418.448,3425.555,"The landlord said he would get around to it when he would get around to it, like an abusive husband.",144,,
608,0.97,3425.555,3429.159,Like he has more important things to do than taking care of real Renters he is ripping off.,144,,
609,0.97,3429.159,3433.496,Being abusive and unprofessional while she is forced to be friendly because he lives in a different part of the house.,144,,
610,0.97,3433.496,3447.11,"If the Renters rights committee does not protect us from abusive landlords that Overcharge for rundown rentals, the only thing the Council is attempting is to make it seem like smalltime landlords are a benefit to community.",144,,
611,0.97,3447.11,3448.711,Quite frankly we could do without them.,144,,
612,0.97,3448.711,3458.154,"We simply need better choices in homes and no shady smalltime landlords can pay their own mortgage instead of ripping off Renters, being totally unprofessional and not being held honest with Renter protection.",144,,
613,0.97,3458.154,3463.693,Our last Speaker present is Kate Martin.,145,,
614,0.97,3463.693,3468.998,Thank you for coming back to me.,146,,
615,0.97,3468.998,3472.469,I want to make two quick comments on two different topics.,146,,
616,0.97,3472.469,3486.616,"As a small landlord, small housing provider, there is 1000 cuts of this tsunami of legislation and it's terrible for everybody.",146,,
617,0.97,3486.616,3492.956,I do think that you have to recognize that I'm able to provide affordable rent because I have owned my home since 1986.,146,,
618,0.97,3492.956,3499.762,You can quickly figure out when properties sell rent goes up.,146,,
619,0.97,3499.762,3509.472,"You can't expect to see, when the properties have gone up 22%, you will see rent go up when those properties change owners.",146,,
620,0.97,3509.472,3514.744,You might want to put that into your Databank and you can access that.,146,,
621,0.97,3514.744,3529.392,"As far as the gig workers, a third of Americans have to do no harm, for small.",146,,
622,0.97,3529.392,3531.027,Many of my relatives work for door dash.,146,,
623,0.97,3531.027,3532.896,I think you are hurting everyone with this legislation.,146,,
624,0.97,3532.896,3538.868,Thank you for allowing me to make these comments.,146,,
625,0.97,3538.868,3543.606,That is the end of the public comment list of present speakers.,147,,
626,0.97,3543.606,3544.407,"Thank you, Madam clerk.",148,,
627,0.97,3544.407,3547.41,We have reached the end of our list of callers.,148,,
628,0.97,3547.41,3557.72,Thank you . We heard each and every one of you regarding the two pieces of legislation before us today.,148,,
629,0.97,3557.72,3559.455,The public comment period is now closed.,148,,
630,0.97,3559.455,3564.527,With that we will go down to committee reports.,148,,
631,0.97,3564.527,3566.796,I understand that we have an item.,148,,
632,0.97,3566.796,3574.837,Our first item is from Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Pedersen from the Sustainability and Renters rights committee.,148,,
633,0.97,3574.837,3579.576,"Madam clerk, please read the item into the record.",148,,
634,0.97,3579.576,3607.737,"The Sustainability and Renters rights Committee, counsel bill 120325, relating to housing and displacement mitigation expanding the information required for submission under the rental registration inspection ordinance for rental housing units . requiring submission of rental housing related information and amending chapter 22.214 of the Seattle municipal code.",149,,
635,0.97,3607.737,3612.208,Before we move on I need to recognize that Councilmember Lewis has joined us.,150,,
636,0.97,3612.208,3614.477,"With that, Councilmember Sawant.",150,,
637,0.97,3614.477,3617.547,"Thank you, Council President Juarez.",151,,
638,0.97,3617.547,3625.154,Councilmember Pedersen is the prime sponsor of this legislation . I will turn the floor over to him.,151,,
639,0.97,3625.154,3629.692,I do have some comments but I will wait until he has a chance to introduce his bill.,151,,
640,0.97,3629.692,3632.295,"Councilmember Sawant, do you want to speak after Councilmember Pedersen?",152,,
641,0.97,3632.295,3632.962,Okay.,152,,
642,0.97,3632.962,3634.564,Okay.,152,,
643,0.97,3634.564,3637.5,"Go ahead, Councilmember Pedersen.",152,,
644,0.97,3637.5,3641.204,"Thank you, Council President.",153,,
645,0.97,3641.204,3643.473,"Council President, may move the bill?",153,,
646,0.97,3643.473,3644.107,Yes.,154,,
647,0.97,3644.107,3644.507,Okay.,155,,
648,0.97,3644.507,3650.146,Colleagues I would like to move passage of counsel bill 120325 on our agenda.,155,,
649,0.97,3650.146,3653.116,Second.,156,,
650,0.97,3653.116,3657.687,Thank you.,157,,
651,0.97,3657.687,3661.424,"Council President Juarez, I will go ahead and speak to it now.",157,,
652,0.97,3661.424,3666.062,"Thank you, Council President Juarez and Councilmember Sawant.",157,,
653,0.97,3666.062,3686.649,"Cunsel bill 120325 will effectively fill a long- standing gap in data collection and analysis for Seattle's rental housing inventory, which will generate several benefits including key data needed to measure and prevent economic displacement of existing residents from our dynamic, growing city.",157,,
654,0.97,3686.649,3697.96,"Seattle's rental housing registration inspection ordinance, adopted several years ago, already requires landlords to submit a list of the rental units.",157,,
655,0.97,3697.96,3710.506,"This bill would simply have property owners include that list along with rental rates, occupancy status, square footage of each unit, to a research University to compile and analyze the important data.",157,,
656,0.97,3710.506,3715.845,No personal information of the tenants would be provided.,157,,
657,0.97,3715.845,3726.923,"For the past several years our city government has lacked the level of detail needed to understand many details about Seattle's housing inventory, including the extent of affordable housing that is not subsidized but still has Below- market rent.",157,,
658,0.97,3726.923,3735.431,Usually because the housing stock is older . Some refer to it as naturally occurring affordable housing.,157,,
659,0.97,3735.431,3746.109,This legislation also follows through on our statement of legislative intent . The Council adopted it in November of 2020.,157,,
660,0.97,3746.109,3764.994,I understand that rental housing providers had to absorb many changes and requirements over the past few years . for us time is running out for the simple yet vital data before we attempt to update the city's comprehensive plan that will serve as a foundation for future housing and Land-Use policies.,157,,
661,0.97,3764.994,3785.281,"The July 2019 report, prepared by the city office, by the urban displacement project of the University of California, titled heightened displacement risk indicators for the city of Seattle.",157,,
662,0.97,3785.281,3791.02,It States that in more granular and localized data is needed to best meet the city's racial equity goals.,157,,
663,0.97,3791.02,3798.194,The Seattle market rate housing needs and supply analysis was prepared for the city in 2021.,157,,
664,0.97,3798.194,3802.532,He stated that displacement can result from demolition of rental housing for redevelopment.,157,,
665,0.97,3802.532,3815.478,As I mentioned before we adopted a statement of legislative intent in November of 2020 that asked the executive to come back with a plan to address this data gap.,157,,
666,0.97,3815.478,3828.891,"Unfortunately the plan was not effective, merely suggesting that we hire a different private survey firm . One went out of business in 2018.",157,,
667,0.97,3828.891,3838.301,"Demonstrated that we probably should not be relying on a private sector firm to collect data for a large city like Seattle, that has dynamic changes going on with its policies.",157,,
668,0.97,3838.301,3848.311,"It's time for us to take additional steps, such as requiring the data we need to mitigate and prevent displacement.",157,,
669,0.97,3848.311,3852.849,The Database already exists.,157,,
670,0.97,3852.849,3866.495,Analysis of the rental housing data will require the contracted research to set up Spreadsheets or Database to enter and sort the rental rates and other information.,157,,
671,0.97,3866.495,3867.93,I'm happy to address questions about cost.,157,,
672,0.97,3867.93,3869.599,I can touch on them briefly here.,157,,
673,0.97,3869.599,3879.208,Ibelieve the figures in the fiscal NOTE are very high estimates and they lack the cost-effective rigor and reality of the proposal process that will occur.,157,,
674,0.97,3879.208,3891.02,Also we have seen the budgets increased substantially from 2021 to 2022.,157,,
675,0.97,3891.02,3899.862,As part of the new bill that was introduced a few weeks ago we did insert a sunset clause.,157,,
676,0.97,3899.862,3915.878,"For landlords concerned about the ongoing burden of providing a list of information that they would normally have their own Record-Keeping and tracking of rental revenues, this bill contains a sunset clause to end this process by December of 2025.",157,,
677,0.97,3915.878,3923.886,"In other words, for those concerned about the bill, it has already been modified substantially by limiting the amount of time it is in effect.",157,,
678,0.97,3923.886,3933.329,"While the first rounds of data may not be available for the executive departments to complete their initial draft of comprehensive planning materials the data will be available for us, for city council members, before any final decisions are made on the plan.",157,,
679,0.97,3933.329,3938.701,I'm happy to answer questions or turn it over to others.,157,,
680,0.97,3938.701,3948.077,Before I turn over to Councilmember Sawant does anybody have questions for Councilmember Pedersen before we let Councilmember Sawant address it?,158,,
681,0.97,3948.077,3950.98,Then we will move to Councilmember Morales in a moment.,158,,
682,0.97,3950.98,3951.681,Okay.,158,,
683,0.97,3951.681,3953.816,I'm not seeing any.,158,,
684,0.97,3953.816,3956.052,"Councilmember Sawant, do you want to address this?",158,,
685,0.97,3956.052,3961.624,And that I believe Councilmember Morales has a few items for us.,158,,
686,0.97,3961.624,3962.425,Thank you.,159,,
687,0.97,3962.425,3974.804,I support this bill and Councilmember Pedersen for bringing it forward . It will be good to have more data about the rental landlords charge.,159,,
688,0.97,3974.804,3980.309,"This bill simply requires landlords to disclose the rent that they charge so that policymakers can have accurate, objective data.",159,,
689,0.97,3980.309,3998.961,It is pretty ironic that in public comment landlords have simultaneously claimed that they charge low rent and also objected to actually disclosing the rent they charge.,159,,
690,0.97,3998.961,4008.003,I don't by the stated reasons from these landlords that they are opposed to collecting this data because it will be some sort of burden.,159,,
691,0.97,4008.003,4013.909,It's not clear at all while it would be a burden to report the rent you are already charging.,159,,
692,0.97,4013.909,4014.944,You already have the paperwork.,159,,
693,0.97,4014.944,4025.354,It's really telling that the landlord lobby has turned out in opposition to this very straightforward bill that is about data collection.,159,,
694,0.97,4025.354,4029.025,It is not a commentary on rent in any way.,159,,
695,0.97,4029.025,4030.159,The reason is clear.,159,,
696,0.97,4030.159,4043.839,It is more accurate and complete data that can help confirm what every Renter in Seattle and every advocating housing member in Seattle already knows.,159,,
697,0.97,4043.839,4052.214,Big landlords and the predatory markets are gouging Renters with totally unconscionable rent HIKES.,159,,
698,0.97,4052.214,4062.358,"The cost of housing is being set by the greed of speculative banks, private equity funds, and property management corporations . rather than what it actually costs to house people.",159,,
699,0.97,4062.358,4073.068,"While some make billions, working people and the poor are increasingly priced out just to have a roof over their heads and they are getting pushed into homelessness.",159,,
700,0.97,4073.068,4075.137,We need to strengthen all of the aspects of Renters rights.,159,,
701,0.97,4075.137,4089.452,"We also need strong citywide rent control and a big increase in taxes on the rich, like the Amazon tax, to increase expansion of social housing.",159,,
702,0.97,4089.452,4098.06,This bill stipulates that landlords have to provide information to the city about the rent they are charging.,159,,
703,0.97,4098.06,4103.032,I will vote yes on this legislation and I hope all Councilmembers will also vote yes.,159,,
704,0.97,4103.032,4105.835,Thank you.,159,,
705,0.97,4105.835,4109.238,Does anyone have any questions for Councilmember Sawant before we move on to Councilmember Morales?,160,,
706,0.97,4109.238,4109.438,Okay.,160,,
707,0.97,4109.438,4110.706,I'm not seeing any.,160,,
708,0.97,4110.706,4116.078,Councilmember Morales?,160,,
709,0.97,4116.078,4116.912,"Good afternoon, colleagues.",161,,
710,0.97,4116.912,4118.113,"Thank you very much, Council President.",161,,
711,0.97,4118.113,4119.181,I have a couple of amendments.,161,,
712,0.97,4119.181,4123.552,I would like to first move amendment eight to counsel bill 120325.,161,,
713,0.97,4123.552,4125.988,Both of these were distributed on Friday.,161,,
714,0.97,4125.988,4129.825,Is there a second?,162,,
715,0.97,4129.825,4132.728,"I will grant you a second, Councilmember Morales.",162,,
716,0.97,4132.728,4134.063,Thank you very much.,163,,
717,0.97,4134.063,4143.539,This amendment adds a recital to state the Council intent is that this information would be public.,163,,
718,0.97,4143.539,4154.049,"Anything we do is public . The data itself, as many have said, is already publicly available.",163,,
719,0.97,4154.049,4161.59,"I just want to cover our bases that stating that to this coalition of publicly available information, and its use by the city, will ultimately be public.",163,,
720,0.97,4161.59,4166.662,Either through public disclosure or via a data source like the Seattle services portal.,163,,
721,0.97,4166.662,4170.833,That is what we are trying to do with this.,163,,
722,0.97,4170.833,4171.5,Thank you.,164,,
723,0.97,4171.5,4175.571,Any comments for Councilmember Morales regarding her amendment?,164,,

743,0.97,4212.741,4222.885,No.,181,,
744,0.97,4224.92,4226.121,"Six in favor, three opposed.",182,,
745,0.97,4226.121,4227.856,"That was six in favor, three opposed.",183,,
746,0.97,4227.856,4228.857,The motion carries.,183,,
747,0.97,4228.857,4229.925,The amendment is adopted.,183,,
748,0.97,4229.925,4233.395,Let's move on.,183,,
749,0.97,4233.395,4235.264,"Councilmember Morales, I believe you have another amendment.",183,,
750,0.97,4235.264,4236.031,Yes.,184,,
751,0.97,4236.031,4244.373,I moved to amend counsel bill 120325 on amendment E. which was also distributed on Friday.,184,,
752,0.97,4244.373,4246.008,Second.,185,,
753,0.97,4246.008,4249.311,It has been moved and Seconded.,186,,
754,0.97,4249.311,4250.613,"Go ahead, Councilmember Morales.",186,,
755,0.97,4250.613,4257.72,This reflects technical changes that we did receive a request for Bisd Ci.,187,,
756,0.97,4257.72,4259.154,It would do a couple of things.,187,,
757,0.97,4259.154,4271.3,The first is that it would set the start date for the legislation the contract signing so that SDC I will have time to ramp up.,187,,
758,0.97,4271.3,4275.604,It also provides landlords time to apply with the legislation.,187,,
759,0.97,4275.604,4286.215,It also sets a sunset for all parts of this bill so that there is no ambiguity around enforcement of certain provisions versus others.,187,,
760,0.97,4286.215,4291.153,That is what we have with this amendment.,187,,
761,0.97,4291.153,4292.855,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",188,,
762,0.97,4292.855,4293.422,Any questions or comments?,188,,

764,0.97,4294.023,4295.157,"Thank you, Council President.",189,,
765,0.97,4295.157,4305.567,I want to thank the collaboration with Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Sawant.,189,,
766,0.97,4305.567,4307.469,This amendment does two different things.,189,,
767,0.97,4307.469,4317.88,I definitely support refining it so that the sunset clause is clearly in all of the sections.,189,,
768,0.97,4317.88,4320.049,It will definitely make for a cleaner bill.,189,,
769,0.97,4320.049,4333.629,I am concerned a little bit with giving the Department all of that time because the first date when the rental information is due is October.,189,,
770,0.97,4333.629,4336.065,We really want to get the information as soon as possible.,189,,
771,0.97,4336.065,4341.003,I still support the bill if this amendment passes.,189,,
772,0.97,4341.003,4342.738,I will be voting no on this amendment.,189,,
773,0.97,4342.738,4344.406,I just wanted to explain why.,189,,
774,0.97,4344.406,4355.05,I am not sure it is going to be expeditiously contracted with the research University.,189,,
775,0.97,4355.05,4356.585,Thank you.,189,,
776,0.97,4356.585,4359.621,Anyone else before we move to a vote on the amendment?,190,,
777,0.97,4359.621,4363.592,Councilmember Mosqueda?,190,,
778,0.97,4363.592,4364.593,Thank you very much.,191,,
779,0.97,4364.593,4377.573,I appreciate that this amendment is being brought forward so that we can potentially work with the Department on the concerns they have.,191,,
780,0.97,4377.573,4378.874,I will be supporting this amendment.,191,,
781,0.97,4378.874,4380.642,I still have concerns on the underlying bill.,191,,
782,0.97,4380.642,4382.711,I will make sure to chat about those after this vote.,191,,
783,0.97,4382.711,4384.213,I will be supporting this amendment today.,191,,
784,0.97,4384.213,4384.947,Thank you.,192,,
785,0.97,4384.947,4385.347,Anybody else?,192,,
786,0.97,4385.347,4385.547,Okay.,192,,
787,0.97,4385.547,4386.281,Councilmember Herbold?,192,,
788,0.97,4386.281,4389.852,Thanks.,193,,
789,0.97,4389.852,4392.121,Accounts member Pedersen addressed this in his comments.,193,,
790,0.97,4392.121,4397.493,I just want to uplift a little more detail.,193,,
791,0.97,4397.493,4405.567,In 2015 this was the first major plan that included what was called a displacement risk analysis.,193,,
792,0.97,4405.567,4412.808,"We have come a since that time, used a risk analysis for many of our Land-Use decisions.",193,,
793,0.97,4412.808,4430.692,The risk analysis was instrumental to the Council's deliberations on the mandatory housing Affordability Re-Zones to minimize the likelihood that those results would accelerate displacement.,193,,
794,0.97,4430.692,4439.334,On April 5th we received a memo from the planning Commission on specific topics related to our next major plan update.,193,,
795,0.97,4439.334,4447.042,They wrote to us to say that we should make Anti-Displacement policies a focus of a comprehensive plan.,193,,
796,0.97,4447.042,4458.153,And we should do so to disrupt decades of inequitable growth patterns that led to the disproportionate displacement of low income communities.,193,,
797,0.97,4458.153,4478.273,"The major update to the comprehensive plan expected in 2024 needs to include not only Anti-Displays and policies as a central focus of the plan, but we should supplement knowledge shared by communities affected by displacement with improved data tracking of high displacement risk areas and the outcomes of policy actions.",193,,
798,0.97,4478.273,4498.293,"I just lifting that up to say, if we are making a change to the date when this information is due we might be depriving ourselves of useful data that will help us to make decisions around the major update.",193,,
799,0.97,4498.293,4502.331,For that reason I am not inclined to support this amendment.,193,,
800,0.97,4502.331,4511.24,The key.,194,,
801,0.97,4511.24,4512.574,"Councilmember Herbold, I have a question.",194,,
802,0.97,4512.574,4513.575,I was looking at it.,194,,
803,0.97,4513.575,4516.879,I'm going to address it to you because you brought up the Anti- displacement risk analysis.,194,,
804,0.97,4516.879,4519.214,That was like the heat map that we got.,194,,
805,0.97,4519.214,4521.016,Great.,194,,
806,0.97,4521.016,4523.051,I want to make sure we are on the same page.,194,,
807,0.97,4523.051,4524.953,"It was high opportunity, low access.",194,,
808,0.97,4524.953,4525.621,I've got it.,194,,
809,0.97,4525.621,4531.46,Good.,194,,
810,0.97,4531.46,4534.329,When we did those amendments I remember us having to use those maps.,194,,
811,0.97,4534.329,4534.529,Okay.,194,,
812,0.97,4534.529,4534.73,Good.,194,,
813,0.97,4534.73,4539.701,Anyone else that would like to comment before we go to a vote on amendment B?,194,,
814,0.97,4539.701,4541.136,I want to respond.,195,,
815,0.97,4541.136,4552.814,"I appreciate the comments . I don't think anybody is interested in Anti-Displacement as much as I am, given the District I represent.",195,,
816,0.97,4552.814,4553.882,I certainly appreciate the comments.,195,,
817,0.97,4553.882,4558.52,This is really about trying to make sure that they have the capacity to do the work we are asking them to do.,195,,
818,0.97,4558.52,4572.034,Many of us here know how overtaxed they are and the challenge the Department has with meeting some of the things we are asking them to do.,195,,
819,0.97,4572.034,4579.474,"This isn't, in any way, and attempt to delay us getting access to important information.",195,,
820,0.97,4579.474,4585.547,It's just a chance for us to make sure the Department is prepared to do what we are asking them to do.,195,,
821,0.97,4585.547,4587.149,I urge your support.,195,,
822,0.97,4587.149,4596.725,"Councilmember Morales, I do not think that Councilmember Herbold was suggesting that.",196,,
823,0.97,4596.725,4597.759,But just making the point.,196,,
824,0.97,4597.759,4598.36,Thank you.,196,,
825,0.97,4598.36,4599.194,I want to thank everybody.,196,,

881,0.97,4757.252,4761.756,Councilmember Morales?,225,,
882,0.97,4761.756,4774.336,I'm excited about the conversation about getting ready for the plan.,226,,
883,0.97,4778.94,4780.375,I think there is a shared common ground.,226,,
884,0.97,4780.375,4786.615,"There's a lot of excitement about the opportunity to address the housing needs in our city, both to develop affordable housing units and make sure we are looking at displacement.",226,,
885,0.97,4786.615,4798.593,"It has been well articulated in this meeting and previous meetings that the plan in front of us, both of the community engagement this year, the policy development next year, and the drafting of the policy in 2024 is a huge opportunity to address the growing needs of our community and also make sure we are preventing displacement.",226,,
886,0.97,4798.593,4803.465,I think there are a number of ways that we can currently get the data that is being sought.,226,,
887,0.97,4803.465,4813.341,"I hope that we can turn toward some of the data that the director of the University of Washington, center for real estate and research, has offered to us.",226,,
888,0.97,4813.341,4826.288,They offered to help the framework and community engagement strategies to work on getting some of the information that we might need on rental data collection and I look forward to potentially working with them.,226,,
889,0.97,4826.288,4834.329,I also think there is a huge opportunity for us to dig into the data that is currently being provided by the city and work with these external partners to really pull out from it.,226,,
890,0.97,4834.329,4835.697,Additional information might be needed.,226,,
891,0.97,4835.697,4842.904,My concern is the price tag associated with this.,226,,
892,0.97,4842.904,4847.375,"Thank you, council member Pedersen, for speaking to the potential opportunity to drive down some of those costs.",226,,
893,0.97,4847.375,4848.043,And Councilmember Morales.,226,,
894,0.97,4848.043,4853.982,You are trying to extend out to the Timeframe and I think that may help with some of the cost.,226,,
895,0.97,4853.982,4862.991,"Given that the departments have indicated, via the central staff memo, and the cost system in the fiscal note, an estimated range of $2 Million- $5 million.",226,,
896,0.97,4862.991,4875.737,"We will have competing budget priorities and a budget gap him as we discussed, that we are looking to close.",226,,
897,0.97,4875.737,4877.572,Not just in this year but the out years.,226,,
898,0.97,4877.572,4884.646,"I want to make sure we have a process to address the departments capacity concerns to implement a program with our existing staff including staffing for compliance review and enforcement, customer support, Medications, and I.T.",226,,
899,0.97,4884.646,4887.716,Upgrades to track the information that is being submitted.,226,,
900,0.97,4887.716,4896.224,I'm also interested in working to see what we can do to support the departments because they have stated a large amount of uncertainty for the amount of funding that will be needed.,226,,
901,0.97,4896.224,4912.707,And a hindrance to contract for data collection.,226,,
902,0.97,4918.079,4921.917,Property owners would provide and suggest various amendments that I don't see in the legislation in front of us.,226,,
903,0.97,4921.917,4924.786,"Again, not being on the committee, I appreciate the hard work that went into this.",226,,
904,0.97,4924.786,4936.298,I especially focus on the fiscal NOTE and the other available data and external partners who can help us get some of the data that the legislative intent really speaks to.,226,,
905,0.97,4936.298,4940.802,I'm voting no on this today and I look forward to working with folks on the common ground that I started with.,226,,
906,0.97,4940.802,4941.403,Thank you.,227,,
907,0.97,4941.403,4942.237,Is there anyone else?,227,,

916,0.97,4989.584,5010.405,I really am concerned about the city having a burdensome new possession and production responsibility of Rob rent data pursuant to the public disclosure act.,227,,
917,0.97,5017.612,5019.614,"-- for maintaining the data, for releasing the data.",227,,

951,0.97,5122.45,5124.018,"Thank you so much, Madam chair.",250,,
952,0.97,5124.018,5127.589,I have some initial remarks here.,250,,
953,0.97,5127.589,5128.957,Do we have an amendment?,250,,
954,0.97,5128.957,5132.66,We do.,251,,
955,0.97,5132.66,5136.731,With your permission I will take this off.,252,,
956,0.97,5136.731,5141.536,Thank you.,252,,
957,0.97,5141.536,5161.489,As we all know we live in a very expensive city and we also know that many delivery workers are accounted for.,252,,
958,0.97,5162.924,5163.691,-- not accounting for expenses.,252,,
959,0.97,5163.691,5174.969,It also has one of the highest numbers of employees on food stamps in all of Washington State and one of the highest numbers of employees on Medicaid in all of Washington state.,252,,
960,0.97,5174.969,5190.251,We know that Appa-Based work is one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy with more and more workers turning to this type of work and not receiving labor standards.,252,,
961,0.97,5190.251,5204.299,The passage of this today would help tens of thousands of delivery workers to make ends meet while maintaining the flexibility.,252,,
962,0.97,5204.299,5215.109,We held our first Stakeholder meeting . Since then there was a total of a dozen large Stakeholder meetings followed by many additional One-On-One meetings.,252,,
963,0.97,5215.109,5223.384,I want to thank the many participants in those efforts.,252,,
964,0.97,5223.384,5240.802,"This included door dash, Uber eats, task rabbit, Rover, Instacart, go puff, Seattle restaurants United, workers and worker advocacy groups . such as drive forward, working Washington, and the law project.",252,,
965,0.97,5240.802,5247.175,Last week's committee discussion central staff walked us through 16 separate amendments.,252,,
966,0.97,5247.175,5253.314,The committee then voted . with one abstention and four votes in favor to recommend the bill to the full council today.,252,,
967,0.97,5253.314,5262.156,This is a Testament to the hard work everyone has put into this process.,252,,
968,0.97,5262.156,5266.06,We know there are still businesses that are concerned about the legislation.,252,,
969,0.97,5266.06,5278.606,This is a very expensive city to live and work in and paying employees sub minimum wages is the only way businesses can sustain their model.,252,,
970,0.97,5278.606,5281.709,There should be some consideration of whether or not that business model really works.,252,,
971,0.97,5281.709,5295.49,"We know that these businesses are making record revenues with door dash, who reported nearly 5 billion in revenue in 2021, up 69% over 2020.",252,,
972,0.97,5295.49,5300.361,They also paid their Ceo over $400 million in 2020.,252,,
973,0.97,5300.361,5307.468,"Uber reported revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021, feeding their own estimates.",252,,
974,0.97,5307.468,5316.177,"Instacart's 2021 revenue grew 10%, Year-Over-Year, to $1.65 billion.",252,,
975,0.97,5316.177,5323.951,"The company's evaluation is $24 billion, up from almost $18 billion a few months prior.",252,,
976,0.97,5323.951,5329.157,"Given this, how is it that paying workers a minimum wage could be a threat to their business model?",252,,
977,0.97,5329.157,5335.129,I'm really disappointed the legislation has passed out of the committee protections for many workers.,252,,
978,0.97,5335.129,5360.621,"Let's remember that the legislation the council passed last June, the independent contractors detection ordinance, means that independent contractors that are not covered by today's bill will have access to information so that they can receive Precontract disclosures, timely payment, and payment disclosures for services valued at $600 or more.",252,,
979,0.97,5360.621,5365.56,The Office of labor standards has been conducting.,252,,
980,0.97,5365.56,5371.299,They will process it this year for this bill and all of these protections will go into effect beginning in September this year.,252,,
981,0.97,5371.299,5386.514,"To the small businesses concerned about price increases . We know that a lot of small businesses are strongly in favor of this legislation, like Seattle restaurants United.",252,,
982,0.97,5386.514,5406.534,For those that still have concerns keep in mind that you are currently protected from price increases . in April of 2020 the former Mayor signed an emergency order that prevents At-Based delivery companies from purging more than 50% of the purchase price of an order.,252,,
983,0.97,5406.534,5419.013,I understand that the Council is working on drafting this policy as a Council bill to extend that protection and really look forward to supporting that incredibly important legislation.,252,,
984,0.97,5419.013,5430.124,"Remember, every dollar in a low wage workers pocket ads $1.21 to the economy and investment in our local businesses.",252,,
985,0.97,5430.124,5434.662,It leads to job creation too.,252,,
986,0.97,5434.662,5442.003,I do want to highlight the other alterations made to the bill on their request that I did support.,252,,
987,0.97,5442.003,5454.115,"We reduced each of the associated cost factors, the associated time factor, and the associated mileage factor.",252,,
988,0.97,5454.115,5457.985,These are all inputs that resulted in reducing the minimum payment calculation as originally proposed.,252,,
989,0.97,5457.985,5467.495,"We include a requirement that the office of labor standards produced the notices of rights in translations, removing that burden from the company.",252,,
990,0.97,5467.495,5479.64,We included a requirement that allows network companies to take adverse action against a worker for fraud if that company has a fraud policy.,252,,
991,0.97,5479.64,5486.614,They change the effective date of the ordinance from 12 months to 18 months.,252,,
992,0.97,5486.614,5492.153,"Remember that the transportation network company legislation, the fair share, was passed unanimously back in November, 2019.",252,,
993,0.97,5492.153,5496.224,"The effective date for that legislation was January 1st, 2021.",252,,
994,0.97,5496.224,5502.964,That gave them 13 months for companies to adjust.,252,,
995,0.97,5502.964,5510.171,We now have an effective date under passage that is five months longer than fair share.,252,,
996,0.97,5510.171,5526.721,This gives the platforms more time to adjust but it also means the workers we have been hearing from today will be waiting two years longer for the same kind of guarantees that drivers are already receiving things to our legislation.,252,,
997,0.97,5526.721,5537.198,I have some closing remarks after hearing and will give thanks after hearing the amendment.,252,,
998,0.97,5537.198,5539.8,That is what I wanted to say for my opening remarks.,252,,
999,0.97,5539.8,5540.468,Great.,253,,
1000,0.97,5540.468,5551.112,Remind me to come back to you because I will forget to do closing remarks.,253,,

1002,0.97,5555.216,5556.484,I met on that committee.,254,,
1003,0.97,5556.484,5556.851,Yes.,254,,
1004,0.97,5556.851,5557.618,That is my understanding.,254,,
1005,0.97,5557.618,5566.761,"I would like to move to amend Council bill 120294, as presented on amendment 17, which we distributed before noon today.",254,,
1006,0.97,5566.761,5574.101,Second.,255,,

1010,0.97,5577.204,5577.605,Thank you.,256,,
1011,0.97,5577.605,5588.282,I did watch the committee over the weekend and it was disappointing to see workers get excluded from the policy at the last minute.,256,,
1012,0.97,5588.282,5591.586,I do believe we have to make sure these workers are protected as well.,256,,
1013,0.97,5591.586,5612.673,"This amendment really expresses the counsel intent to consider regulating marketplace companies regarding minimum payment, flexibility, and transparency for separate legislation no later than next summer, August 1ST, 2023.",256,,
1014,0.97,5612.673,5617.812,I think it's important we pass the pay up legislation today and continue moving forward on additional policies for workers in our city.,256,,
1015,0.97,5617.812,5625.152,"Whether you get a job from an apple or an ad, work is work and every worker deserves basic rights like minimum wage.",256,,
1016,0.97,5625.152,5629.857,I am offering this amendment today in hopes that my colleagues will support it.,256,,
1017,0.97,5629.857,5634.462,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",257,,

1044,0.97,5684.178,5689.917,With that I will hand it back over to Councilmember Herbold.,277,,
1045,0.97,5689.917,5695.456,I was hoping to have closing remarks.,278,,
1046,0.97,5695.456,5700.161,"My cosponsor, council member Lewis, might have some remarks as well.",278,,
1047,0.97,5700.161,5700.561,I'm sorry.,279,,
1048,0.97,5700.561,5701.162,I apologize.,279,,
1049,0.97,5701.162,5703.064,Council member Lewis has his hand up too.,279,,
1050,0.97,5703.064,5706.701,I can't see.,279,,
1051,0.97,5706.701,5708.135,Is it just Council member Lewis?,279,,
1052,0.97,5708.135,5708.335,Okay.,279,,
1053,0.97,5708.335,5708.803,Councilmember Lewis?,279,,
1054,0.97,5708.803,5710.971,And then Councilmember Sawant.,279,,
1055,0.97,5710.971,5717.511,"Thank you, Council President Juarez.",280,,
1056,0.97,5717.511,5723.117,I appreciate the opportunity to speak this is legislation and I appreciate the partnership of Councilmember Herbold in moving this forward.,280,,
1057,0.97,5723.117,5746.073,This is the first in a series of measures for Long-Standing inequities in our local economy and our gig work and At-Based work has driven technological changes and shifts in our economy.,280,,
1058,0.97,5746.073,5753.481,"This legislation, by no means, is going to be the final word on this.",280,,
1059,0.97,5753.481,5775.236,"I appreciate the amendment brought up by Councilmember Morales, putting a Timeline for future legislation, which will be looking at ways to create some level of certainty and regulation into how the marketplace has conducted their work.",280,,
1060,0.97,5775.236,5785.312,"Also several other pieces of legislation, including how deactivation's work and transparency.",280,,
1061,0.97,5785.312,5793.721,And a notice of how these pay standards impact folks who are in this gig economy.,280,,
1062,0.97,5793.721,5797.258,"As Councilmember Morales just noted a lot of this work, increasingly, has been driven.",280,,
1063,0.97,5797.258,5806.033,Not because it's new work or new types of jobs that people do but because there are new ways to deliver them across the varying business models.,280,,
1064,0.97,5806.033,5819.613,"This counsel previously moved to regulate the transportation network companies, Uber, in that same vein.",280,,
1065,0.97,5819.613,5827.288,Soon we will be considering other aspects in this economy and I appreciate the work of Councilmember Herbold in bringing this together.,280,,
1066,0.97,5827.288,5839.099,"I very much appreciate the work of Camilla Brown, on my staff, who has worked hand in hand with the office and the Stakeholders and bringing together folks.",280,,
1067,0.97,5839.099,5853.48,"I appreciate the work and stewardship of this area as well as all of the other partners from other organizations who have provided input, including representatives from the platforms and representatives from drive forward.",280,,
1068,0.97,5853.48,5865.359,This is the first step in continuing the mission to expand what the roll and future of work will look like in the city of Seattle.,280,,
1069,0.97,5865.359,5877.504,I look forward to continuing this work throughout this year and into next year and to continue to monitor this legislation as it goes into Rulemaking.,280,,
1070,0.97,5877.504,5880.174,I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this and look forward to voting.,280,,
1071,0.97,5880.174,5880.808,Thank you.,281,,
1072,0.97,5880.808,5882.676,I just want to make sure I got it correct.,281,,
1073,0.97,5882.676,5889.283,I think Councilmember Sawant was next and then Councilmember Mosqueda and then Councilmember Morales and then Councilmember Nelson.,281,,
1074,0.97,5889.283,5890.251,I have to write this down.,281,,
1075,0.97,5890.251,5890.885,I apologize.,281,,
1076,0.97,5890.885,5892.152,I got it mixed up.,281,,
1077,0.97,5892.152,5893.954,Councilmember Sawant?,281,,
1078,0.97,5893.954,5894.588,Thank you.,282,,
1079,0.97,5894.588,5899.593,I voted yes on the amendment and of course I support the legislation as a whole.,282,,
1080,0.97,5899.593,5906.233,I think all the workers who spoke today and previously in public comment in support of legislation.,282,,
1081,0.97,5906.233,5913.674,"As a Socialist I have repeatedly explained in the past that big business, under capitalism, has enormous power.",282,,
1082,0.97,5913.674,5935.195,And every victory of the workers movement has come under attack and has gradually chipped away . The alternative is to fundamentally and the power that big business has to claw back every penny that workers have won and fight for global socialism.,282,,
1083,0.97,5935.195,5938.699,"Big business does not want to pay minimum wage, does not want to respect other worker rights.",282,,
1084,0.97,5938.699,5944.638,When we say big business it is not an inanimate object.,282,,
1085,0.97,5944.638,5947.308,"It is the Billionaires, the Multimillionaires, the very wealthy elite.",282,,
1086,0.97,5947.308,5960.02,"They amend the notion of gig workers, independent contractors, and suddenly you have a whole section of the workforce where workers rights and regulations apparently do not apply.",282,,
1087,0.97,5960.02,5967.094,The gig industries are also linked in other ways to the fundamental nature of capitalism.,282,,
1088,0.97,5967.094,5971.131,It is not--constantly under attack.,282,,
1089,0.97,5971.131,5991.652,"But the industry also illustrates how, as the global capitalist system has gone deeper and deeper into a long- term crisis over the last decade, the Billionaires and Multimillionaires have increasingly created more and more avenues to squeeze every last drop of blood from the global working-class.",282,,
1090,0.97,5991.652,5993.52,That is why you see the evolution of such industries.,282,,
1091,0.97,5993.52,6020.18,Now that the pay up legislation would extend minimum wage protections to gig workers--passed an amendment to create a new legal fiction for the marketplace net worth . workers and big business will redefine--big businesses will redefine themselves into that loophole.,282,,
1092,0.97,6020.18,6027.988,"Te city council should be reversing that loophole, but that was not the amendment before us in the last vote.",282,,
1093,0.97,6027.988,6032.493,I support this legislation to close the loophole for minimum wage protections created by the contractor's legal notion.,282,,
1094,0.97,6032.493,6041.802,I support closing the marketplace too if the Council numbers want to do that.,282,,
1095,0.97,6041.802,6044.271,The workers movement fights for better wages and that is essential.,282,,
1096,0.97,6044.271,6053.113,We also need to fight for socialism so we are not continually forced to fight for the right to survive.,282,,
1097,0.97,6053.113,6055.115,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",283,,
1098,0.97,6055.115,6058.619,Councilmember Mosqueda?,283,,
1099,0.97,6058.619,6059.753,"Thank you, Council President.",284,,
1100,0.97,6059.753,6064.525,And thanks again to Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Lewis.,284,,
1101,0.97,6064.525,6071.965,The other cosponsors of this legislation.,284,,
1102,0.97,6071.965,6076.403,It is my great privilege and pride to be able to support you in this legislation today.,284,,
1103,0.97,6076.403,6083.911,And to continue to underscore for members of the public how long this process has been underway.,284,,
1104,0.97,6083.911,6086.847,To say that it has been coming for a long time is an understatement.,284,,
1105,0.97,6086.847,6096.924,We knew that this type of legislation was needed for basic standards to protect gig workers . The concept of the PAP legislation and the campaign from the community really got a lot of attention in 2019.,284,,
1106,0.97,6096.924,6120.414,"Since then gig workers, Front- line workers, essential workers, workers that we deem to be heroes have only, since then, because of the pandemic, been put more in the spotlight because of the type of work they have done and more at risk to do the work that they do during this pandemic.",284,,
1107,0.97,6120.414,6128.021,"I'm excited to support this legislation today and to recognize the many months, years of hard work that went into this piece of legislation.",284,,
1108,0.97,6128.021,6130.224,"And to really, as well, thank the staff from the cosponsors.",284,,
1109,0.97,6130.224,6135.362,"Alice, Camilo, I want to thank the central staff and name them by name.",284,,
1110,0.97,6135.362,6145.806,"Amy, Jasmine, they have a tremendous amount of work with the office of labor standards and many other departments as well to craft this legislation.",284,,
1111,0.97,6145.806,6147.841,"Councilmember Herbold, you are saving your thank you.",284,,
1112,0.97,6147.841,6150.677,I hope I'm not stepping on toes.,284,,
1113,0.97,6150.677,6153.18,They probably do not hear it enough.,284,,
1114,0.97,6153.18,6181.008,I also want to thank my chief of staff who has worked with the pieces of legislation in front of us through the various Iterations and in close coordination with members of the Mayor's office and office of labor standards and the broad community of worker representatives as well as industry representatives to further understand the implications of the bill in front of us.,284,,
1115,0.97,6181.008,6184.645,Thank you for the hard work.,284,,
1116,0.97,6184.645,6187.748,I will be voting yes.,284,,
1117,0.97,6187.748,6195.122,I do want to underscore the significant reservations due to the amendments that were made in the committee last week.,284,,
1118,0.97,6195.122,6199.326,This legislation will still benefit thousands of workers.,284,,
1119,0.97,6199.326,6201.562,That should be a moment where we all celebrate today.,284,,
1120,0.97,6201.562,6221.515,"But to be honest we also need to, at the same time, recognize the amendment that was passed in committee last week cuts out basic protections for thousands of other workers and sets a precedent that I hope will not Replicate across this country and the amendment that was brought forward today so that we can continue to work on this policy area.",284,,
1121,0.97,6221.515,6222.115,No policy is perfect.,284,,
1122,0.97,6222.115,6237.497,"When faced with the decisions I think it is our belief in my office that we err on the side of listening to those that are on the front line, listening to those that have less power, listening to those who are in a more vulnerable situation.",284,,
1123,0.97,6237.497,6243.704,And with the lived experience of being Prioritized.,284,,
1124,0.97,6243.704,6246.607,Whether it's on platforms or funding and protections or state and Federal law.,284,,
1125,0.97,6246.607,6258.652,We need to continue to listen to those voices that have been on the frontline and not relinquishing our efforts to make sure that more workers are folded into these protections today.,284,,
1126,0.97,6258.652,6265.525,I appreciate everyone who has called in and offered robust testimony and to explain how separate policy for market place workers will impact them.,284,,
1127,0.97,6265.525,6272.699,"I'm looking forward to continuing this conversation throughout this year, as I know Councilmember Herbold has other pieces of legislation in the hopper.",284,,
1128,0.97,6272.699,6276.737,I look forward to the following conversations in 2023 as well.,284,,
1129,0.97,6276.737,6282.743,"Thanks, as well, for your support for the amendment that we put forward.",284,,
1130,0.97,6282.743,6299.126,"Trans two and I have put forward an amendment to make sure we are looking at the inflammation for the budget this year and we began a process of ensuring that there was a additional conversation around revenue, especially for revenue.",284,,
1131,0.97,6299.126,6313.006,I look forward to building on this legislation and to celebrating all that workers accomplished today with out letting the end goal of getting workers included as well.,284,,
1132,0.97,6313.006,6314.174,Congratulations to everyone.,284,,
1133,0.97,6314.174,6316.51,Thank you so much.,284,,
1134,0.97,6316.51,6319.246,We have incorporated so many different voices.,284,,
1135,0.97,6319.246,6323.116,Congratulations.,284,,
1136,0.97,6323.116,6327.587,Councilmember Morales?,285,,
1137,0.97,6327.587,6328.388,Thank you.,286,,
1138,0.97,6328.388,6335.462,I am also excited for this legislation and the pieces that I know will be coming in subsequent weeks and months.,286,,
1139,0.97,6335.462,6365.559,"We know that there is over 40,000 workers in Seattle who depend on this work, particularly people with disabilities, people of color, immigrants, single parents, Lgbtq workers . These Apps, while they do provide an opportunity for folks to find and float--they shipped all of the costs and all of the risk to workers . and it really leaves the earning well below minimum wage after expenses.",286,,
1140,0.97,6365.559,6377.003,We know that a recent report found Seattle gig workers are getting paid just $9.58 an hour and jobs pay less than minimum wage.,286,,
1141,0.97,6377.003,6380.073,There has been an exploitation of a glaring loophole in our labor standards.,286,,
1142,0.97,6380.073,6393.687,"Simply calling workers, independent contractors, these multibillion-dollar Apps have avoided basic worker protections and that is the problem we are trying to solve here.",286,,
1143,0.97,6393.687,6398.859,The payable policy that is up for vote today will close that loophole.,286,,
1144,0.97,6398.859,6403.797,It will ensure basic protection for thousands of workers by ensuring that they are paid at least minimum wage with other basic protections.,286,,
1145,0.97,6403.797,6412.205,Regardles of whether somebody is cleaning in-house or delivering food . that is the goal.,286,,
1146,0.97,6412.205,6426.386,To make sure that regardless of the kind of App they are on they are being protected.,286,,
1147,0.97,6426.386,6428.088,And those who companies choose to call contract workers.,286,,
1148,0.97,6428.088,6429.089,It is an exciting day.,286,,
1149,0.97,6429.089,6432.426,"Seattle is leading the way by listening to gig workers, providing them with what they need.",286,,
1150,0.97,6432.426,6438.265,"These jobs, as I said, have the potential to be good paying jobs.",286,,
1151,0.97,6438.265,6456.283,"They are important options for people who need flexibility and I think it's important that rather than passive fair pay costs onto consumers, the companies, some of which saw the revenues soar by 70%, as Councilmember Herbold said, should themselves pay the true cost of labor out of their own pockets and stop the Exploitive model from becoming the new normal.",286,,
1152,0.97,6456.283,6466.126,"I'm looking forward to supporting this, to supporting future legislation, and to continue this conversation over the next year.",286,,
1153,0.97,6466.126,6468.195,I do want to thank my staff as well.,286,,
1154,0.97,6468.195,6468.562,Alexis Oliver.,286,,
1155,0.97,6468.562,6470.897,They have been working on this with our colleagues.,286,,
1156,0.97,6470.897,6472.332,I look forward to supporting it.,286,,
1157,0.97,6472.332,6475.535,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",287,,
1158,0.97,6475.535,6477.003,Councilmember Nelson?,287,,
1159,0.97,6477.003,6479.906,Thank you very much.,288,,
1160,0.97,6479.906,6503.129,"I support a minimum pay standard for delivery drivers but I've always been concerned that setting the delivery fee too high will lower demand, which could result in the unintended consequences of reducing drivers and the revenue of small businesses, like restaurants.",288,,
1161,0.97,6503.129,6514.474,It can also disproportionately impact the most vulnerable customers who also tend to be low income and might not be able to afford the fee.,288,,
1162,0.97,6514.474,6529.556,"I will be supporting this legislation today because it has vastly improved from the bill that was introduced most significantly by Councilmember Pedersen's amendment, which I supported, to remove marketplace companies from being covered by working Washington's proposal.",288,,
1163,0.97,6529.556,6531.091,I believe their inclusion was an overreach.,288,,
1164,0.97,6531.091,6538.265,It made no sense to me to regulate by service providers who set their own rates and negotiate directly with the customers.,288,,
1165,0.97,6538.265,6543.169,"They provide things like home Healthcare, Childcare, pet care, and help with household tasks.",288,,
1166,0.97,6543.169,6547.607,Just because those professionals use an App to reach some of their customers.,288,,
1167,0.97,6547.607,6557.05,I really hadn't seen convincing evidence that the majority of them make under the minimum wage.,288,,
1168,0.97,6557.05,6565.692,Quite frankly this proposal has a long history and I believe it will pass.,288,,
1169,0.97,6565.692,6584.277,"I submitted voting no would diminish their confidence that I can negotiate in good faith to improve future legislation, whatever it is.",288,,
1170,0.97,6584.277,6587.013,That is what pragmatism is and I will be voting yesterday.,288,,
1171,0.97,6587.013,6591.284,Great.,289,,
1172,0.97,6591.284,6592.619,I'm going to be supporting this.,289,,
1173,0.97,6592.619,6594.587,I will tell you why.,289,,
1174,0.97,6594.587,6598.525,I should tell everyone that I like what they said.,289,,
1175,0.97,6598.525,6600.894,I will share with you I am voting yes.,289,,
1176,0.97,6600.894,6606.499,Councilmember Morales and Council member Nelson hit the nail on the head for me.,289,,
1177,0.97,6606.499,6608.468,We have been dealing with the gig economy.,289,,
1178,0.97,6608.468,6612.272,I like what Councilmember Morales said.,289,,
1179,0.97,6612.272,6613.273,I always felt this way.,289,,
1180,0.97,6613.273,6616.977,To some degree it is an Exploitive model.,289,,
1181,0.97,6616.977,6635.829,"Until we answer the question about whether or not a gig worker is an employee or indeed a contract worker, and we have not addressed that straight on for the labor and this economy and the people that actually take on these jobs, we are going to continually decide how this works when we have a gig economy.",289,,
1182,0.97,6635.829,6637.497,I believe we are going in the right direction.,289,,
1183,0.97,6637.497,6651.611,This is the shape of things to come because it is a labor issue and there is a surge for people who use this as their job.,289,,
1184,0.97,6651.611,6655.081,The bigger business companies have made billions of dollars during our pandemic.,289,,
1185,0.97,6655.081,6659.786,If that's what it took him as you know the pandemic has taught us many lessons.,289,,
1186,0.97,6659.786,6670.764,If that's what it took for us to get here and people to recognize how much money is companies are making on people who they do not have to call employees.,289,,
1187,0.97,6670.764,6688.314,"Wht we have done is taken upon ourselves, as we should do as elected officials, to start Deconstructing this economy and making sure that the people who are on the front lines, who are delivering food and doing all of those things are compensated.",289,,
1188,0.97,6688.314,6690.15,They are taken care of.,289,,
1189,0.97,6690.15,6694.587,"That is our job at the end of the day as government officials, to make people's lives hopefully better.",289,,
1190,0.97,6694.587,6700.427,With that I will head over to Councilmember Herbold for closing remarks and we will call on the clerk to call the roll.,289,,
1191,0.97,6700.427,6701.461,Thank you so much.,290,,
