60,0.97,405.671,407.907,I've been doing gig work since I was nine years old.,11,,
61,0.97,407.907,409.308,Hustling is what we called it.,11,,
62,0.97,409.308,411.711,I would help people get home with their groceries from the supermarket.,11,,
63,0.97,411.711,413.413,"55 years later, this is not news to me.",11,,
64,0.97,413.413,417.283,A lot of newer and recent drivers don't worry about how much we made only two years ago.,11,,
65,0.97,417.283,422.922,It's absurd to be asked to deliver someone's packages for two dollars to customers.,11,,
66,0.97,422.922,429.228,These companies employ need to pay out more for the jobs that we do.,11,,
67,0.97,429.228,441.04,"These companies constantly change the terms of agreement, which always lead to the drivers working more to oblige the company while getting paid less and less to do the trips.",11,,
68,0.97,441.04,444.844,Drivers throw caution to the wind.,11,,
69,0.97,444.844,451.551,"Every time one jumps on a new platform, there's continued risk of transmitting a fatal virus to the members of the home they live in.",11,,
70,0.97,451.551,453.619,"We are essential and at risk, period.",11,,
71,0.97,453.619,465.832,"The delivery industry is growing big time and we need proper working conditions advocated for, like yesterday.",11,,
72,0.97,465.832,473.139,"Therefore, we need someone on our representative Council to advocate for us workers, and get us paid properly.",11,,
73,0.97,473.139,476.175,Thank you for your time.,11,,
74,0.97,476.175,479.579,"Thank you, James for calling in.",12,,
75,0.97,479.579,482.215,Our next Speaker is Jake Miller.,12,,
76,0.97,493.526,493.893,Hello.,13,,
77,0.97,493.893,494.861,My name is Jake Miller.,13,,
78,0.97,494.861,498.097,"I have been doing gig work since August 2018 on Postmates, door dash, and Amazon flex.",13,,
79,0.97,498.097,512.812,I am here to comment in support of CB 119798 in support of good workers.,13,,
80,0.97,512.812,515.615,Workers are being paid below the minimum wage to deliver during this pandemic.,13,,
81,0.97,515.615,520.319,Companies can get away with this because many of these people doing this essential work don't have any other options.,13,,
82,0.97,520.319,524.724,"When I started doing door dash in 2018, the minimum PAYOUT for a delivery was $6.50.",13,,
83,0.97,524.724,535.902,"Over time it has gradually gone down, but since the beginning of this crisis, the massive influx of new drivers has allowed door dash to cut their minimum PAYOUT to as low as three dollars per delivery.",13,,
84,0.97,535.902,538.137,This is simply unacceptable.,13,,
85,0.97,538.137,546.646,"Additionally, companies like door dash and Postmates have not provided personal protective equipment, meaning good workers are required to acquire it for ourselves.",13,,
86,0.97,546.646,555.955,All of this is why we need some sort of essential hazard pay for essential workers for the duration of this crisis.,13,,
87,0.97,555.955,565.565,"This crisis hit, and my regular employer got into the Ppp.",13,,
88,0.97,565.565,578.778,"That means I don't have to depend on get work the way I did in the past, but forget workers who do depend on this income, the current pay structure means they are getting some minimum wage wages while risking their health to provide an essential service.",13,,
89,0.97,578.778,595.194,"If I can get paid my regular wage from my W-2 employer, for doing absolutely nothing, I think it is absolutely absurd that we cannot pay the essential workers in this city a minimum wage to risk their lives and deliver during a crisis.",13,,
90,0.97,595.194,597.863,Thank you for allowing me the time to speak.,13,,
91,0.97,597.863,605.905,"Please, enact this legislation CB 115199.",13,,
92,0.97,605.905,607.239,Thank you.,13,,
93,0.97,612.611,614.313,Thank you so much for calling in today.,14,,
94,0.97,614.313,622.822,Our next Speaker is going to be Zachariah Harataugh.,14,,
95,0.97,622.822,627.293,My name is Zachariah 23.,15,,
96,0.97,627.293,631.998,"I drive for Uber, Postmates, door dash and Grubhub.",15,,
97,0.97,631.998,635.434,I think Mike Council members allowing me to speak.,15,,
98,0.97,635.434,646.412,"As a driver, I am not only exposing myself but my children and I'm incurring additional expenses for Disinfecting products and clean between customers.",15,,
99,0.97,646.412,656.389,"At times, I provide customers with masks and I have been getting with customers who are not covering when they are coughing.",15,,
100,0.97,656.389,663.462,I am not aware of the severity of the pandemic that's happening.,15,,
101,0.97,663.462,669.668,I would urge Council members to consider giving good workers hazard pay.,15,,
102,0.97,669.668,671.971,Thank you.,15,,
103,0.97,671.971,673.773,Thank you so much for calling in today.,16,,
104,0.97,673.773,689.255,Our next Speaker is Ghadani Tekleah.,16,,
105,0.97,689.255,690.756,"Hello, my name is Ghadani Tekleah.",17,,
106,0.97,690.756,694.493,I've been working for Uber since 2015.,17,,
107,0.97,694.493,695.861,"In the beginning, the pay was okay.",17,,
108,0.97,695.861,714.413,"Then all of a sudden, the pay gets cut from six dollars per delivery trip to three dollars a trip, and with the three dollars per delivery on average, it's just not a living wage, or a livable income to live off of.",17,,
109,0.97,714.413,733.933,"I believe that these companies depend on the customers to tip and they use the tip as part of the payment plan, and that, to me, is not right because the tip should be in addition to the payment that we receive for doing the delivery.",17,,
110,0.97,734.867,760.159,"When we are working in times like these, where there is additional risk to our health, and to our well-being, and our family members depend on us to come back to help them and take care of them, I feel like we should get additional pay for this because, no matter how hard we try, we can put gloves on and where our masks.",17,,
111,0.97,760.159,769.668,There is still a potential risk that we can still be sick while we are trying to complete our job.,17,,
112,0.97,769.668,789.788,"So, the companies on their own, will not care about doing anything, but if they are pushed to give us extra pay during extra additional times where we are taking additional risks, I feel it's okay.",17,,
113,0.97,789.788,796.195,"It should be something that they should automatically say, this is what we should do for our drivers, and they are not doing that.",17,,
114,0.97,796.195,799.565,Thank you.,17,,
115,0.97,799.565,806.872,I appreciate you taking the time.,17,,
116,0.97,806.872,808.807,I want to thank all of the Council members.,17,,
117,0.97,808.807,811.744,"I hope this passes, so that the companies know how important we are.",17,,
118,0.97,812.845,813.979,Thank you for calling in.,18,,
119,0.97,813.979,824.924,Our next Speaker is Aaron Ikalucci.,18,,
120,0.97,824.924,826.992,Too easy.,19,,
121,0.97,826.992,833.632,This is Aaron Ikalucci.,19,,
122,0.97,833.632,834.7,I am an Army veteran.,19,,
123,0.97,834.7,836.535,I've embarked down this gig economy work since 2014.,19,,
124,0.97,836.535,874.874,"Due to the lack of money that we continuously have to pay out due to supply Downtimes, and other risks that we take that are subjected to other environmental factors, like for example, clients not covering their faces, not providing adequate masks, or they are being supplied without masks, we greatly increase our likelihood of Subjecting ourselves to this risk.",19,,
125,0.97,874.874,881.213,"I am a family, not just myself, but I have a wife and two other kids.",19,,
126,0.97,881.213,896.662,"You know, I greatly fear that one day, being one of the major providers for the family, that I'm going to come home and infect my wife, and then I'm going to get out, not able to work.",19,,
127,0.97,896.662,924.79,"I fear that this Covid crisis, and the flux of high demand or people really being able to sign up really is not adequately distributed, I feel, to where we have to be placed in these hardest conditions are working harder for longer hours, to get not even enough to become self sustainable.",19,,
128,0.97,924.79,928.527,"Thank you, everybody.",19,,
129,0.97,928.527,930.596,"In closing, God bless you and have a great day.",19,,
130,0.97,930.596,932.231,Thank you for calling in today.,20,,

132,0.97,944.877,946.345,"Hello, my name is Jason Reeves.",21,,
133,0.97,946.345,953.752,I am a door dash and Postmates driver.,21,,
134,0.97,953.752,954.753,I have done 3352 deliveries.,21,,
135,0.97,954.753,956.355,I've been doing door dash for three years.,21,,
136,0.97,956.355,961.66,"Since the Covid crisis started, I've seen a complete lack of support from the company's.",21,,
137,0.97,961.66,965.264,That's why I am asking for hazard pay.,21,,
138,0.97,965.264,972.371,"As essential front-line workers, we should have our own supply line of Ppe that is given to us.",21,,
139,0.97,972.371,995.16,"But since that's not the case, I am saying essential pay or hazard pay should be given to us because we are out there, exposing ourselves to 10, 20, 30, 40 people a night, and then bringing it to our own communities and Whatnot.",21,,
140,0.97,995.16,996.795,"Without proper potential, we are only aiding Covid-19.",21,,
141,0.97,996.795,1003.302,I am asking the Seattle city Council to show us this great leadership that I've seen and heard of.,21,,
142,0.97,1003.302,1003.702,Stand with us.,21,,
143,0.97,1003.702,1009.174,Work with us.,21,,
144,0.97,1009.174,1021.12,"The hardest working people are the heroes out there, out there on the front line, with materials they need to keep themselves, communities, and the people we work for safe.",21,,
145,0.97,1021.12,1023.789,I like what I do.,21,,
146,0.97,1023.789,1027.026,I don't want to give Sicknesses out to people.,21,,
147,0.97,1027.026,1030.095,That's not why I go to work.,21,,
148,0.97,1030.095,1033.165,I go to work to be a part of my community.,21,,
149,0.97,1036.335,1043.509,The stuff that I've seen--thank you for your time.,21,,
150,0.97,1043.509,1046.945,I would like to yield the remainder of my time.,21,,
151,0.97,1046.945,1048.747,Thank you for calling in.,22,,
152,0.97,1048.747,1061.026,Our next Speaker is Paul Veggars.,22,,
153,0.97,1061.026,1067.866,"I've been delivering with caviar, Postmates, and door dash.",23,,
154,0.97,1067.866,1071.036,"Most recently, with Ubereats because they treated me better than any of the other services have.",23,,
155,0.97,1071.036,1077.643,"But that being said, the pay tends to be inconsistent as has been mentioned by a two other speakers already.",23,,
156,0.97,1077.643,1095.094,"There was a massive influx of drivers just about a week after the Coronavirus pandemic started, and there was a huge drop in pay to the point where it almost didn't feel like it was worth going out and delivering.",23,,
157,0.97,1095.094,1098.363,It was truly meager wages.,23,,
158,0.97,1098.363,1115.614,"It is back up to a reasonable amount again, but I feel, as essential workers, putting ourselves at risk, we deserve a reasonable level of hazard pay, above minimum wage.",23,,
159,0.97,1115.614,1122.121,"And on top of that, we should be earning tips depending on how well we interact with customers.",23,,
160,0.97,1122.121,1138.537,"I feel that the wages we are currently making which are often below minimum wage, are far too low to compensate Couriers for the risks they are taking because, frankly, the risks are unavoidable.",23,,
161,0.97,1138.537,1142.007,I deliver in the U-District.,23,,
162,0.97,1142.007,1150.148,A lot of the restaurants on the App are very tight.,23,,
163,0.97,1150.148,1152.251,"I come into a little restaurant, and there's a little hallway.",23,,
164,0.97,1152.251,1154.286,"Sometimes, there is another courier I have to jockey around.",23,,
165,0.97,1154.286,1155.621,Then there's three or four behind that.,23,,
166,0.97,1155.621,1160.926,We are all breathing the same air.,23,,
167,0.97,1160.926,1164.563,We can practically all smell each other in the space.,23,,
168,0.97,1164.563,1165.764,It's unavoidably dangerous in that way.,23,,
169,0.97,1165.764,1173.839,"Because of that, I believe we have Couriers deserve hazard pay, and I hope you can make that happen for us.",23,,

171,0.97,1175.541,1177.409,Thank you for calling in today.,24,,
172,0.97,1177.409,1183.482,Our next Speaker is Kimberly Wolf.,24,,
173,0.97,1189.221,1196.395,Kimberly?,24,,
174,0.97,1196.395,1197.496,"Okay, I got it now.",25,,
175,0.97,1197.496,1200.299,Thank you for moving me.,25,,
176,0.97,1200.299,1200.899,That's okay.,26,,
177,0.97,1200.899,1201.3,Go ahead.,26,,
178,0.97,1201.3,1211.476,"I've been doing gig work, both PNC and delivery, for five years because I require schedule flexibility.",27,,
179,0.97,1211.476,1219.484,"Originally, they were my primary income but due to the race to the bottom, the pay dropped so low that I had to take another job just to get my basic bills covered.",27,,
180,0.97,1219.484,1226.525,I can't count on gig work alone to pay my bills because that's how these openings operate.,27,,
181,0.97,1226.525,1231.797,They cut pay at every opportunity unless they are officially made to pay better.,27,,
182,0.97,1231.797,1238.937,"So, these gig companies play tricks on their workers to force them to take jobs they wouldn't normally choose.",27,,
183,0.97,1238.937,1242.741,Jobs that cannot meet a simple Cost-Benefit analysis.,27,,
184,0.97,1242.741,1248.647,"Are we really independent contractors, so we don't have the option to refuse a job?",27,,
185,0.97,1248.647,1256.355,"When they require an acceptance rate, which has been raised by the way, we don't really have freedom of choice.",27,,
186,0.97,1256.355,1267.165,"We can project to dollar delivery choices, which means we don't have a choice to refuse the hazardous jobs, either.",27,,
187,0.97,1267.165,1272.838,"During the Covid-19 outbreak, I lost my W-2 job that I relied on for basic bills, and now I only have the good work.",27,,
188,0.97,1272.838,1277.476,It's way too much effort and work for the small income it provides.,27,,
189,0.97,1277.476,1281.146,I can't count on gig work alone because I know how these companies operate.,27,,
190,0.97,1281.146,1283.782,They are paying lip service to Covid assistance programs for the PR.,27,,
191,0.97,1283.782,1292.29,"In reality, there is a minuscule amount of money going to the actual gig workers.",27,,
192,0.97,1292.29,1295.26,"They know they are sending workers out to vulnerable customers, potentially spreading the virus.",27,,
193,0.97,1295.26,1299.464,They are not warning people.,27,,
194,0.97,1299.464,1303.101,"I know a good worker who has Covid and when the company found out, they deactivated her.",27,,
195,0.97,1303.101,1312.01,"When she was at a medical facility later, she found out by accident that the company had never warned him.",27,,
196,0.97,1312.01,1315.681,I am wondering if they warned other people.,27,,
197,0.97,1315.681,1318.917,That's a huge hazard.,27,,
198,0.97,1318.917,1321.186,We have to bear all the costs of our expenses.,27,,
199,0.97,1321.186,1323.822,We need more basic income.,27,,
200,0.97,1323.822,1327.426,"Thank you, Kimberly.",28,,
201,0.97,1327.426,1340.839,Our last Speaker is William Locksham.,29,,
202,0.97,1340.839,1344.943,"Sorry, we are down here in the industrial district so you will probably hear some trains behind me.",30,,
203,0.97,1344.943,1345.744,But that's all right.,30,,
204,0.97,1345.744,1347.346,Something's got to be happening.,31,,
205,0.97,1347.346,1370.135,"I am calling on proposed legislation . I just want to remind people that down here in Sodo, we handle food and are required to have food safety verified by food audit, and we've had trouble in the past with people in Encampments, and they pick up after them.",31,,
206,0.97,1370.135,1378.443,"I pick up their litter, and their human waste, as well.",31,,
207,0.97,1378.443,1381.046,We are calling in their 911 calls.,31,,
208,0.97,1381.046,1386.251,One gentleman was drug off the railroad track.,31,,
209,0.97,1386.251,1390.655,I really want you to carefully consider that we need to be here.,31,,
210,0.97,1390.655,1396.495,"We've got to be at I-90 and I- 5, and near the peers.",31,,
211,0.97,1396.495,1407.305,"It's not as if we can move out of the area, and it's not as if we can get a third party audit that has already warned us about sanitation.",31,,
212,0.97,1407.305,1408.306,That's all I've got.,31,,
213,0.97,1408.306,1410.509,Thank you so much for calling in today.,32,,
214,0.97,1410.509,1432.964,"That is the last Speaker we have on today's Sign-Up sheet, so I am going to go ahead and closeout public comment at this point, and go ahead, and move into items of business on our agenda.",32,,
215,0.97,1432.964,1434.432,First up is payment of the bills.,32,,
216,0.97,1434.432,1435.967,"Clerk, will you please read the title?",32,,

232,0.97,1529.394,1530.862,It's been moved and Seconded.,42,,
233,0.97,1530.862,1537.702,"Councilmember Herbold, you are the sponsor of this appointment, so you are recognized to address this item.",42,,
234,0.97,1537.702,1561.393,"As I explained this morning, and Andrea Shiao has served in an interim capacity as executive director of the public safety service Commission and the civil service Commission.",43,,
235,0.97,1561.393,1564.529,She was appointed on January 22.,43,,
236,0.97,1564.529,1570.835,This is a joint position and appointing authority lies with those two commissions.,43,,
237,0.97,1570.835,1577.075,The Commission conducted a recruitment process and unanimously selected Mr.,43,,
238,0.97,1577.075,1596.795,"Scheele, stating that her domination of knowledge and experience prepares her to read the important work of the civil service and public safety full service commissions.",43,,
239,0.97,1596.795,1603.335,"Through her service as the interim director, Andrea has demonstrated a commitment to Embed equity into her work at every level, serve as a collaborative partner, and provide thoughtful, and authoritative Council.",43,,
240,0.97,1603.335,1605.904,Both commissions themselves are impartial.,43,,
241,0.97,1605.904,1606.438,Quasi judicial bodies.,43,,
242,0.97,1606.438,1609.607,The executive director makes recommendations to the commissions themselves.,43,,
243,0.97,1609.607,1616.314,"But it is the commissions that act on those recommendations, and approve or deny them.",43,,
244,0.97,1616.314,1624.422,The director works to manage meetings and have oversight of the public safety civil service exam process.,43,,
245,0.97,1624.422,1646.945,"As interim director, she has managed Covid-19 related issues regarding testing, and last week, the public safety civil service Commission voted to resolve a Long-Standing issue regarding veterans preference points for firefighter promotions.",43,,
246,0.97,1646.945,1651.216,"Her background includes experience as a human resources manager in the Department of finance and administrative services, directing hr investigations.",43,,
247,0.97,1651.216,1668.533,"She has acted as an assistant city attorney providing labor and employment legal representation, and advice to human resources teams, and litigation regarding labor arbitration and other administrative proceedings.",43,,
248,0.97,1668.533,1678.943,"She is also, before coming to the city works, privately represented agencies, and employment related matters, including sex, age, race, religious disability, and other services.",43,,
249,0.97,1678.943,1693.692,"The appointment itself, as of the Commission-Related appointments, meets the standards of the governor's order 2028 and that it is routine and necessary.",43,,
250,0.97,1693.692,1712.644,"The public safety civil service Commission hears appeals of sworn police and fire employees regarding disciplinary action, and the civil service Commission hears similar appeals for Non-City personnel and can make recommendations related to the personnel system.",43,,
251,0.97,1712.644,1720.919,"Both commissions have three members with the Mayor and Council both appointing members, and the employees electing the third.",43,,
252,0.97,1720.919,1723.588,"This appointment is through January 21, 2023.",43,,
253,0.97,1723.588,1753.852,"And as I clarified in briefings this morning, if anybody has questions regarding the appointment process, and whether or not it CONFIRMS with the expectations the Council have indicated for the confirmation processes in resolution 31868, this particular appointment is not covered by that resolution.",43,,
254,0.97,1753.852,1757.055,The reason is a couple of different reasons.,43,,
255,0.97,1757.055,1759.657,This role is not the Department head.,43,,
256,0.97,1759.657,1772.137,This position doesn't make decisions so much as manage meetings and make recommendations to the Decision- making commissions.,43,,
257,0.97,1772.137,1775.64,"And finally, this is not an appointment where the Mayor appoints and the Council CONFIRMS.",43,,
258,0.97,1775.64,1780.645,This is an appointment where the two commissions bring forward their preferred appointment.,43,,
259,0.97,1780.645,1788.486,But the resolution Referenced earlier covers Department heads.,43,,
260,0.97,1788.486,1806.604,"It was enacted by the Council last year, and identifies really important expectations that the Council has for recruitment, and selection of Department heads that are recommended by the Mayor's office.",43,,
261,0.97,1806.604,1810.508,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for those introductory remarks.",44,,
262,0.97,1810.508,1815.98,Are there any other comments on the appointment?,44,,
263,0.97,1815.98,1816.214,Okay.,44,,
264,0.97,1816.214,1818.416,I am not seeing any.,44,,
265,0.97,1818.416,1828.993,I have had the opportunity to work with Miss Scheele in the past as a private practicing attorney.,44,,
266,0.97,1828.993,1831.029,I have always thought very highly of her.,44,,
267,0.97,1831.029,1841.105,And I think that she is perfectly suited for this position and I really appreciate the opportunity to consider her appointment.,44,,
268,0.97,1841.105,1850.715,I want to thank the appointing authorities as described by Councilmember Herbold for advancing her as the permanent Úappointee for this position.,44,,
269,0.97,1850.715,1861.259,"Hearing no additional comments, I will ask the clerk, please call the roll.",44,,

276,0.97,1907.805,1909.407,I moved to pass CB 119794.,48,,

279,0.97,1914.312,1916.114,Moved and Seconded to pass the bill.,50,,
280,0.97,1916.114,1930.929,"I will address at first as a sponsor, and see if colleagues have comments to add.",50,,
281,0.97,1930.929,1948.846,"Cb 119794, as I discussed in this morning' Council briefing, is related to the Seattle parking enforcement officers' Guild collective bargaining agreement and would authorize the execution of a negotiated Union contract for the city of Seattle . This is a three-year contract for January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021.",50,,
282,0.97,1948.846,1956.654,It includes approximately 105 regularly appointed city employees in the Seattle police Department.,50,,
283,0.97,1956.654,1974.639,"The financial terms of this contract are similar to those of the city coalition's Union and include a retroactive work to present an annual wage increase, and a 3.6% annual wage increase for 2020.",50,,
284,0.97,1974.639,1980.411,The financial and nonfinancial terms of this month at the bargaining agreement were considered and approved by the relations policy committee and are within those previously approved parameters.,50,,
285,0.97,1980.411,1989.454,I am happy to entertain any questions or hear any comments from any of my colleagues.,50,,

287,0.97,1994.359,1994.959,Thank you.,51,,
288,0.97,1994.959,2001.399,"I appreciate the hard work of our labor relations policy Committee, and the difficult decisions you have to make.",51,,
289,0.97,2001.399,2011.609,"I do not serve on that particular committee of Educative and executive leaders that represent management and to negotiate the multitude of employment contract Impacting 12,000 city government workers.",51,,
290,0.97,2011.609,2028.226,"I carefully consider each contract on its own terms, and at this moment in time, with the grim physical challenges, our city government faces today, I will be voting no on this particular contract for parking enforcement officers.",51,,
291,0.97,2028.226,2030.094,"Thank You., Councilmember Pedersen, for those remarks.",52,,
292,0.97,2030.094,2038.403,I just really quickly want to be responsive to the extent that I can be.,52,,
293,0.97,2038.403,2096.294,"We don't need to Belabor the point, but this particular contract based on the evaluation given to us by the city budget office, does not have dire or detrimental impacts on the projected deficit of the city of Seattle, and I think that I and the members of the labor relations policy Committee, which includes four other Council members and members of the executive team carefully engaged with the city budget office to make sure this was not only a high road employer contract, but also a contract that was fiscally responsible, and within our existing means as a city, and feel comfortable that the contract before us strikes the right balance, and that in approving this contract, we will not be Subjecting the sitting budget to further pressure or crisis.",52,,
294,0.97,2096.294,2101.999,As a result of the contract.,52,,
295,0.97,2101.999,2108.172,I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting approval of this particular contract.,52,,

298,0.97,2119.317,2125.123,Think you very much for going to signal that I will be voting in favor of ratifying this contract today.,53,,
299,0.97,2125.123,2162.927,"It gets critical that, as we go into what is going to be a very difficult, a lot of very difficult conversations about the budget over the summer and this fall, that we not lose sight of the fact that some of the most essential functions of government that we serve as a city are our first responders, law enforcement, firefighters, and certainly, the employees included under this contract to provide an essential law enforcement based mechanism that is really essential to maintaining the social contract that holds the city of Seattle together.",53,,
300,0.97,2162.927,2177.975,"These are some of the services that we need to fight more than ever to make sure we are maintaining adequately, and that these are workers we are seeking to have measures in place to retain and encourage them to stay in our workforce.",53,,
301,0.97,2177.975,2183.648,There has never been a more appropriate time I think to ratify a contract for this group of workers.,53,,
302,0.97,2183.648,2205.77,"I hope it sets a precedent that we try to make sure to set a budget that not only delivers essential services, but really defines our values as a progressive city, and I think it really starts by making sure that we boldly stand by some of the workers doing really essential and critical work out there, but hasn't abated during this crisis.",53,,
303,0.97,2205.77,2208.639,I will be voting in favor of this.,53,,
304,0.97,2208.639,2210.675,Thank you.,54,,

329,0.97,2434.431,2456.687,"We appreciate the ongoing cooperation of our Union parties and the collaboration of leaders that requires so many of our central workers to be responsible, responsive, and responding to this health crisis.",59,,
330,0.97,2456.687,2501.532,"The memorandum of understanding is one I think we should all support and is certainly reflective of the tremendous amount of commitment that are represented staff and all of our staff have towards the continuing to serve the public, in this moment of crisis, and really want to take an opportunity similar to what Councilmember Herbold did this morning, to thank all of our city of Seattle employees who are essential to the ongoing delivery of services and the people of Seattle, and for their agreement to this memorandum of understanding, which will allow us as a city, to continue to deliver these clinical services while also making sure that we are taking care of the health and safety of our own employees.",59,,
331,0.97,2507.137,2511.075,"I would encourage all of you, colleagues, to join me in supporting the passage of this Council bill.",59,,

333,0.97,2518.315,2521.819,"Hearing and seeing none, will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of this bill?",59,,
334,0.97,2521.819,2526.156,[roll call],60,,
335,0.97,2550.981,2552.95,The bill passes and the chair will sign it.,61,,
336,0.97,2552.95,2556.554,I would ask that the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation.,61,,
337,0.97,2556.554,2560.257,We are at the other business portion of our agenda.,61,,
338,0.97,2560.257,2567.131,Is there any other further business to come before the Council?,61,,
339,0.97,2567.131,2573.037,"Councilmember Lewis, you are recognized.",61,,
340,0.97,2573.037,2574.672,"Thank you so much, Madam President.",62,,
341,0.97,2574.672,2578.509,I do have a quick thing for the consideration of the Council relating to tomorrow's committee meeting.,62,,
342,0.97,2590.688,2596.56,"As many members of this Council are aware, we have been in conversations with a variety of different Presenters for the select Committee on homelessness deliberations.",62,,
343,0.97,2596.56,2602.499,"One of which is our partner at King County health, Seattle King County public health.",62,,
344,0.97,2602.499,2620.651,"I have been working since Thursday of last week, Thursday, may 21, to secure the appearance of Patty Hayes or a Designee of Patty Hayes from public health to participate as a member of the deliberation, as a Panelist for the deliberations of the committee tomorrow.",62,,
345,0.97,2620.651,2628.092,I believe that a representative from King County public health is essential.,62,,
346,0.97,2628.092,2642.206,Based on the nature of the legislation will Councilmember Morales has brought forward.,62,,
347,0.97,2642.206,2645.709,One of the reasons for this discussion is informing city practices to public health best practices.,62,,
348,0.97,2645.709,2655.519,"It is a discussion about the guidance from the CDC and from public health, and how our offerings of shelter are squaring with that.",62,,
349,0.97,2655.519,2676.04,"So, the participation of public health, their ability to answer questions from this Council, their ability to be responsive to this underlying concern, is going to be essential for having a fair hearing for all parties involved.",62,,
350,0.97,2676.04,2687.785,"On Thursday, may 21, my office Emailed director Patty Hayes, and Susie levy at public health to inform them of the committee.",62,,
351,0.97,2687.785,2694.091,"They declined at that time, the invitation, saying they didn't believe they were going to have time to present.",62,,
352,0.97,2694.091,2709.706,"My office sent a follow up Email, indicating that we would take anyone from King County public health.",62,,
353,0.97,2709.706,2711.842,That it did not have to be the director.,62,,
354,0.97,2711.842,2715.212,It could be a doesn't need to talk about the guidelines and answer the questions of Councilmembers.,62,,
355,0.97,2715.212,2719.283,"They still said, it would be difficult for them to respond to that request.",62,,
356,0.97,2719.283,2743.64,"This morning, we again reached out, saying we needed someone from public health, and there was still a hurdle in being able to produce somebody . I did receive, during our council meeting, a response from public health, indicating that if we sent the written questions, they could apply with written responses.",62,,
357,0.97,2743.64,2755.853,"I do not believe that would be adequate for the exchange the trend to expect, and the information the committee would want to have to inform our deliberations and comments on this legislation.",62,,
358,0.97,2755.853,2784.081,"Given those efforts, and given that we have tried to produce by invitation, witnesses from King County public health, I am requesting today that the Council pursuant to our power under article 4, section 4, paragraph six of the Charter, issue a subpoena for director Patty Hayes to appear at the committee select on homelessness tomorrow or provide a doesn't mean.",62,,
359,0.97,2784.081,2795.859,"I know that is an extreme mechanism to request, but I do want to make sure that we have someone from public health to participate in the discussion, and I am requesting it.",62,,
360,0.97,2795.859,2799.963,I have talked to the law Department about this.,62,,
361,0.97,2799.963,2809.473,They have indicated that it is within our power pursuant to the charter to do this.,62,,
362,0.97,2809.473,2815.779,"But that it should be done by a vote of the Council and not pursuant to a single Councilmember, so I wanted to bring it up for discussion.",62,,
363,0.97,2815.779,2822.92,"I thought this was the appropriate place to do it, and I am making that motion.",62,,
364,0.97,2832.963,2834.031,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",63,,
365,0.97,2834.031,2866.163,"It is certainly an extraordinary request, and I will give you the fact that it is also pretty extraordinary circumstances that we are living in, so I appreciate your intent of making sure that this Council bill has a full and effective and transparent process.",63,,
366,0.97,2866.163,2874.471,"What I'm hearing is, from your perspective, it's essential to compel the attendance of somebody from public health.",63,,
367,0.97,2874.471,2891.355,"It sounds like you have exhausted your options to gain compliance, somebody actually attending the meeting.",63,,
368,0.97,2891.355,2900.264,"I am going to really quickly ask the clerk, Amelia, you probably want to Unmute here soon.",63,,
369,0.97,2900.264,2912.809,"I want to ask and make sure that we are appropriately considering this motion, and that we are complying with our procedural requirements, related to the motion.",63,,
370,0.97,2912.809,2924.621,"Amelia, if you can provide us with some guidance on that particular procedural question, I would appreciate it.",63,,
371,0.97,2924.621,2930.127,"Councilmember Gonzalez, if you wouldn't mind being at ease for about a minute, so I can confer.",64,,
372,0.97,2930.127,2936.033,I have someone on the loan to talk with you about that really quickly.,64,,
373,0.97,2936.033,2946.61,"Madam clerk, would it be possible for us to engage in conversation while you have the conversations that you need to have?",65,,
374,0.97,2946.61,2955.519,Or would it be inappropriate for us to discuss the proposed motion before getting clarity?,65,,
375,0.97,2955.519,2970.334,You are welcome to discuss the merits of the question and then I can let you know when I am prepared to advise you with a response.,66,,
376,0.97,2970.334,2971.368,Thank you so much.,67,,
377,0.97,2971.368,2974.137,"If you could send me an Email or Interject, that would be great.",67,,
378,0.97,2974.137,2977.074,"Colleagues, this is a question that has been put on the table by Councilmember Lewis.",67,,
379,0.97,2977.074,2993.89,"I want to go ahead, for the sake of transparency, and an effort to have dialogue, as a Council, I want to make sure that we have the opportunity to consider the question being posed by Councilmember Lewis.",67,,
380,0.97,2993.89,2996.66,I would open it now to any of my colleagues who have questions.,67,,
381,0.97,2996.66,3000.43,"Any questions or comments, colleagues?",67,,
382,0.97,3005.836,3009.973,"Madam President, if I could request a five minute recess?",68,,
383,0.97,3009.973,3020.517,That might be helpful for everyone to wrap their heads around what has been put in front of all of us.,68,,
384,0.97,3020.517,3025.589,And then resume the conversation at that time.,68,,
385,0.97,3025.589,3048.345,"I am not sure that I see--I think if there's going to be conversations that occur, that need to happen about the substance of your request, that should appropriately happen in open public session for us to maintain compliance with the open public meetings act.",69,,
386,0.97,3048.345,3056.62,I want to make sure that we are not signaling to the viewing public that we are somehow going to use the minutes in a way that would be inappropriate.,69,,
387,0.97,3056.62,3067.431,Why don't we go ahead and open up for a quick debate now.,69,,
388,0.97,3067.431,3071.334,"There will be an opportunity, Councilmember Lewis, for you to take advantage of the next few minutes to clarify questions.",69,,
389,0.97,3071.334,3073.837,The first person I saw was Councilmember Herbold.,69,,
390,0.97,3073.837,3083.68,"I just wanted to know whether or not, Procedurally, Madam President, we should seek a second on the motion before discussing it?",70,,
391,0.97,3083.68,3084.581,Good point.,71,,
392,0.97,3084.581,3094.858,I specifically asked the clerk whether we needed to have a second before we discussed the question.,72,,
393,0.97,3094.858,3096.092,She indicated that was not necessary.,72,,
394,0.97,3096.092,3103.099,We can continue to have the conversation with the understanding that there are some open questions around the process that she is working on figuring out.,72,,
395,0.97,3103.099,3105.168,I didn't understand that included a second.,73,,
396,0.97,3105.168,3106.203,Thank you.,73,,
397,0.97,3106.203,3114.978,Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Mosqueda.,74,,
398,0.97,3114.978,3116.112,Thank you.,75,,
399,0.97,3116.112,3129.326,"It's definitely a frustrating situation that we are here to talk about, a public health issue, and we can't get an answer from the public health Department or their participation, so far.",75,,
400,0.97,3129.326,3138.401,"I would be interested to know, as you are contemplating this, what precedent you might have found, and has the Council done this before?",75,,
401,0.97,3138.401,3139.569,Under what kind of circumstances?,75,,
402,0.97,3147.777,3154.751,I am not aware of any example of us previously using this power.,76,,
403,0.97,3154.751,3161.091,"I would defer to folks who've been on the Council longer and have more institutional memory of this, but I don't have any precedent.",76,,
404,0.97,3165.595,3169.633,Councilmember Mosqueda?,77,,
405,0.97,3169.633,3170.834,Thank you so much.,78,,
406,0.97,3170.834,3174.871,"Thank you, Madam President.",78,,
407,0.97,3174.871,3180.577,"I know you and the good chair, everybody is working as hard as we can to sponsor legislation.",78,,
408,0.97,3180.577,3187.484,"To be on the same team, I know that folks at public health are extremely busy.",78,,
409,0.97,3187.484,3209.206,"I would love to just do a huge shout out to the folks at public health, including Patty Hayes and her entire team because we know, from the beginning, we've been trying to make sure all counties had the information they need for example.",78,,
410,0.97,3209.206,3214.911,"In mid or early February, we had asked for time at the Council briefing and we had a lot of things on the calendar that day.",78,,
411,0.97,3214.911,3217.38,"I asked, do you mind if we do it in two weeks?",78,,
412,0.97,3217.38,3229.526,"And two weeks later, there had already been the first death from Covid-19, so public health has really been trying to call everyone's attention to this matter and not only talk about the threat to lives, but how we can prevent illness and death.",78,,
413,0.97,3229.526,3231.828,I think the folks at public health have been working overtime.,78,,
414,0.97,3231.828,3234.431,I just want to say thank you to them.,78,,
415,0.97,3234.431,3243.74,"I can see Councilmember Lewis's head nodding in agreement, for those who can't see all of our faces on zoom.",78,,
416,0.97,3243.74,3248.011,I think that's a sentiment that we all share a huge amount of appreciation for them.,78,,
417,0.97,3248.011,3259.556,"I also think there is a huge interest in making sure that the public health elements of any future legislation, including the one related to the navigation team are well coordinated.",78,,
418,0.97,3259.556,3281.144,"I would Posit, that's the backbone of this conversation, making sure that our city efforts are in coordination with public health and the county, so that each arm of government knows what the other one is doing, and that we are creating smooth transitions, and warm Handoffs for people to get into the housing they need.",78,,
419,0.97,3281.144,3296.159,"Councilmember Lewis, I don't know if I have spoken long enough to filibuster, that I think you are probably getting similar messages that I am getting from folks who've been watching this, and eagerly trying to figure out a solution, but I would suggest that from some of the messages I've received, folks have said, we will be there.",78,,
420,0.97,3296.159,3301.865,Your message has been received.,78,,
421,0.97,3301.865,3317.213,"Probably, a subpoena is not necessary at this point, so I wanted to echo those points of appreciation.",78,,
422,0.97,3317.213,3319.115,"From the Get-Go, public health was there to support us.",78,,
423,0.97,3319.115,3330.293,"I think there are goals from the chair and this Council that we are well coordinated and I believe that was the spirit in which you suggested the subpoena, but I hope in the last few minutes, you probably have received a similar message that they will, in fact, be sending a representative.",78,,
424,0.97,3330.293,3336.833,"I just wanted to echo my appreciation for why you wanted to make sure there was somebody there, which I fully agree with.",78,,
425,0.97,3336.833,3338.835,We do want to ensure that there is coordination.,78,,
426,0.97,3338.835,3341.638,I think the message has been well received and they are looking to get someone.,78,,
427,0.97,3341.638,3346.543,I will turn it over to the Council president and the good chair who have received similar messages.,78,,
428,0.97,3346.543,3348.812,"Councilmember Mosqueda, Council President, if you don't mind?",79,,
429,0.97,3348.812,3350.947,Go ahead.,80,,
430,0.97,3350.947,3357.52,I believe that something can probably be worked out at this point.,81,,
431,0.97,3357.52,3369.666,"I do want to say, for the record, this was absolutely not something I did lightly or wanted to do.",81,,
432,0.97,3369.666,3376.773,It would never be a first resort.,81,,
433,0.97,3376.773,3387.384,"I am happy to withdraw my motion because, based on your representations, Councilmember Mosqueda, I am confident something can be worked out to produce somebody from King County health at the committee hearing tomorrow.",81,,
434,0.97,3387.384,3394.491,"And at this point, I would withdraw my motion, and I don't have any other new items for business.",81,,
435,0.97,3394.491,3397.494,I don't know if anyone else wants to jump in at this point.,81,,
436,0.97,3397.494,3404.4,Councilmember Mosqueda.,82,,
437,0.97,3404.4,3405.502,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",83,,
438,0.97,3405.502,3410.573,"As chair of the committee, I definitely defer to your leadership Stewarding us not just with this conversation but with others.",83,,
439,0.97,3410.573,3430.927,I think the approach you've taken has rightfully gotten a lot of good attention and I know folks are stretched so thin that helping to Reprioritize is something that's definitely needed so we can get answers to these questions and make sure we are coordinated.,83,,
440,0.97,3430.927,3460.256,"I wanted to say thank you because I think this is definitely coming from a place that wants to make sure we have all of the right cooks in the kitchen at all of the right folks there to answer the questions because I understand how frustrating it is as a member of the committee to not be able to have questions answered, but especially the chair, wanting to make sure we set up a full panel for everybody's answers to Bemake shared.",83,,
441,0.97,3460.256,3465.595,I want to make sure that we know the right folks are at the table.,83,,
442,0.97,3465.595,3466.996,And it worked.,83,,
443,0.97,3475.271,3475.738,We hope.,84,,
444,0.97,3475.738,3485.081,"Colleagues, I know this request from Councilmember Lewis is, and seems extraordinary.",84,,
445,0.97,3485.081,3504.2,"I can't think of an opportunity or a moment in the time that I've been on the city Council, which albeit, hasn't been as long as some of my predecessors, but I can't think of a time when we used what we are entitled to use, which is subpoena power through our charter.",84,,
446,0.97,3504.2,3530.326,"I don't think it's a request that is inappropriate, but I do think that it is important for our partners in this space, and make no mistake that Seattle King County public health has accountability not just to King County but the city of Seattle.",84,,
447,0.97,3530.326,3575.271,"It is our expectation that, when we ask for folks to participate in our conversations, we merit the same level of respect that any other legislative body would command in this particular space, and it is frustrating to be in a position, where we are legitimately, and reasonably requesting participation of our public health partners to help inform a proposed policy that is being motivated by public health rationale for us to have the subject matter experts at the table, and available for questions and answers.",84,,
448,0.97,3575.271,3584.948,To simply brush us off as not being a priority is not something that is going to be acceptable.,84,,
449,0.97,3584.948,3590.086,"Certainly, not during a pandemic and certainly not during any other period of time.",84,,
450,0.97,3590.086,3605.101,"They are serious about taking Data-Driven and Evidence-Based approaches to the work that we are doing, and I believe Councilmember Lewis proposed this potential through that intent, and that purpose.",84,,
451,0.97,3605.101,3624.821,"We have to make sure that we have the subject matter experts available to us, and I hope that the representations that have been made to Councilmember Mosqueda are going to come to fruition, and that we will actually be able to have those subject matter experts available to us.",84,,
452,0.97,3624.821,3627.023,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, for proposing that.",84,,
453,0.97,3627.023,3632.929,"I do not, for one moment, believe you did that blithely.",84,,
454,0.97,3632.929,3660.156,"And I know and trust that you looked at that option as the option of last resort, and I hope our partners of rent Seattle King County public health will take it seriously, and will also understand your intent as it relates to wanting to have their meaningful participation at your Committee meeting tomorrow.",84,,
455,0.97,3660.156,3668.464,Any other questions or comments from our colleagues?,84,,
456,0.97,3668.464,3668.698,Okay.,84,,
457,0.97,3668.698,3670.266,It looks like there are none.,84,,
458,0.97,3670.266,3678.341,"Madam clerk, I know that you are talking to the law Department about advice on this particular procedural issue.",84,,
459,0.97,3678.341,3680.476,Emotion has been withdrawn.,84,,
460,0.97,3680.476,3691.688,"Unless you tell me that needs to be other formal steps on a motion that didn't receive a second, I am going to go ahead and move on.",84,,
461,0.97,3691.688,3695.491,"I believe that you took the proper steps, Councilmember Gonzalez.",85,,
462,0.97,3695.491,3697.96,"Thank you so much, Amelia.",86,,
463,0.97,3697.96,3702.398,Is there any further business to come before the Council?,86,,
464,0.97,3702.398,3707.704,"Seeing and hearing none, colleagues, this concludes the items of business on today's agenda.",86,,
465,0.97,3707.704,3712.375,"Our next city council meeting is June 1, 2020 at 2:00 P.M.",86,,
466,0.97,3712.375,3716.412,I hope you all have a wonderful afternoon.,86,,
467,0.97,3716.412,3717.48,We will see you tomorrow.,86,,
468,0.97,3717.48,3718.014,"Goodbye, everybody.",86,,
469,0.97,3718.014,3718.715,We are adjourned.,86,,
