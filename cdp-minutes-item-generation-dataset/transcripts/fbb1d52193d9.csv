20,0.97,96.463,109.509,"Thank you so much to Council member Lewis, who has Co- response Sored the legislation.",9,,
21,0.97,109.509,119.786,"Through efforts from my office in coordination with the people's budget and activists, we have one city level funding for defense attorneys such as through the housing project.",9,,
22,0.97,119.786,137.103,"The right to Council legislation would commit the city of Seattle to contracting for all the legal representation that is needed, such that attorneys from organization like the housing justice project can defend every Renter facing Eviction who needs help.",9,,
23,0.97,137.103,142.308,"Before the pandemic, about 1200 Renters in Seattle faced Eviction every year.",9,,
24,0.97,142.308,155.722,"Even during the pandemic, with the moratoriums in place, landlords have filed more than 300 Eviction cases with the courts, as they are exploiting loopholes in the moratoriums.",9,,
25,0.97,155.722,175.608,"And without this we can expect a tsunami of Evictions, once the city and state moratoriums expire, as Renters will still be struggling under the double blows of the capitalist recession and the Covid-19 health crisis and will be burdened with debt.",9,,
26,0.97,175.608,179.646,"We know that's vision destroy cities, wreck households and even kill.",9,,

28,0.97,190.723,201.634,"In our study Ofee Vicks, the author of the report the Seattle women's Commission ask the King County bar Association found some tenants died shortly after being evicted.",9,,
29,0.97,201.634,212.679,We also know from data the housing justice project staff will be presenting shortly many Evictions occur because tenants don't show up in court.,9,,
30,0.97,212.679,213.813,These are called default Evictions.,9,,
31,0.97,213.813,219.252,It would be preposterous for thin to claim this is because tenants don't care about being evicted.,9,,
32,0.97,219.252,236.035,"Rather not aware of their rights, they are bullied by their corporate landlords and are led to believe that an E vision is inevitable, that they didn't do anything to find against it or they are daunted by a code system.",9,,
33,0.97,236.035,237.07,Sometimes they give you.,9,,
34,0.97,237.07,243.977,Sometimes tenants are preoccupied with Healthcare challenges or busy with multiple jobs and Childcare and have difficulty making a court Tate.,9,,
35,0.97,243.977,260.326,"I would urge Council members who are members of this Renters' rights committee and the full city Council to pass this bill without watering it down with loopholes, which I'm Hur our panelists are going to be talking about, specifically why we don't want the loophole and why it doesn't work.",9,,
36,0.97,260.326,269.836,"After the Council passes this right to Council legislation the city council must, there is two words down and counsel.",9,,
37,0.97,269.836,279.412,"Right to counsel we mean legal counsel, not as in a committee Council.",9,,

39,0.97,294.36,303.836,"This includes imposing notification requirements on landlords and funding outreach and education so tenants know what their rights are, including their right to legal representation.",9,,
40,0.97,303.836,310.743,"I also want to add a note about who we are talking about, when we talk about landlords who are Evicting.",9,,
41,0.97,310.743,320.286,"We hear more from our panel on this, but suffice it to say it is not struggling mom and pop landlords who are the most Evicting land heard.",9,,
42,0.97,320.286,329.395,"Disproportionately the landlords showing up in court time and again seek to Evict tenants in Seattle and King County are the big, corporate landlords.",9,,
43,0.97,329.395,343.71,"Big, regional, national and even global real estate management cups, which make profits for millionaires and Billionaires at the expense of working class Renters and who have unlimited resources to hire attorneys and other legal resources.",9,,
44,0.97,343.71,351.451,"Also of course I'll mention that tenants in publicly owned housing also, unfortunately, are often victims of Evictions.",9,,
45,0.97,351.451,363.696,But in my view that only adds more evidence as to why we need this kind of Council legislation and why we need to address the Evictions.,9,,
46,0.97,363.696,372.038,"The American civil liberties Union found that nationally, 90% of landlords are represented in Eviction court, while only 10% of tenants are.",9,,
47,0.97,372.038,372.705,Can you imagine?,9,,
48,0.97,372.705,383.082,"As a struggling tenant facing Eviction perhaps because you just lost your low wage job, going up against the likes of attorneys from Goodman real estate?",9,,
49,0.97,383.082,391.357,"A global enterprise with $2.5 billion of worth real estate, that is billion with a B, in managed assets.",9,,
50,0.97,391.357,395.261,And the number one Evicting landlord in our city.,9,,
51,0.97,395.261,398.831,Imagine being a lone tenant going up against a multi- billion dollars enterprise.,9,,
52,0.97,398.831,406.839,Our right to confront Tation will give these tenants a fighting chance in court when they have to go up against these greedy corporate landlord.,9,,
53,0.97,406.839,412.745,We also know we need to do more than win the right of every tenant to be represented in court.,9,,
54,0.97,412.745,416.015,We have to stop Evictions from being filed in the first place.,9,,
55,0.97,416.015,428.594,"That is why my office launched a petition demanding Mayor Durkan and Governor Inslee review the moratoriums for Renters, small businesses and Nonprofits through 2021.",9,,
56,0.97,428.594,453.152,"We know this unprecedented economic crisis for working people will extend at least through the end of this year, and as Seattle and state public health experts have recently reported the public health crisis the original basis for the emergency declarations last March also will extend at least to the end of this year, even with the best pro sections from state health officials.",9,,
57,0.97,453.152,462.995,"I think it is obvious to say tenants roots legislation is wildly popular with rent tenants, who as you know, constitute about half of all resident in our city.",9,,
58,0.97,462.995,469.969,Applies to all the District Council members and the city while Council members and Renters will soon be in the clear majority.,9,,
59,0.97,469.969,477.543,But commit fee members should know that small landlords have also be speak up in support of tenants's rights.,9,,
60,0.97,477.543,483.082,One wrote to us saying I am a landlord and rental property owner.,9,,
61,0.97,483.082,486.586,I support these protections for people rent progress me or from anybody else.,9,,
62,0.97,486.586,493.292,"Money should not rank higher in experience than people's health and safety at any time, but especially during a public health crisis.",9,,
63,0.97,493.292,507.039,"And Evan from West Seattle, responding to our call to extend the Eviction moratorium, wrote I am a Seattle Homeowner who rents out a portion of my home and I support extending the rent moratorium.",9,,
64,0.97,507.039,513.946,It is immoral to kick out Renters during a pandemic when so many are losing their job due to no fault of their own.,9,,
65,0.97,513.946,520.419,I am appreciative of the small landlords who have written in support of tenants's rights in our city.,9,,
66,0.97,520.419,528.127,The right to Council will hopefully be the first in a series of legislation that this committee will discuss in the spring and coming summer.,9,,
67,0.97,528.127,536.669,"In today's committee we will start with discussing the community panel, including Renters and experts about the right to Council and also about future legislation that will be needed.",10,,
68,0.97,536.669,544.477,"As I said, one of the key problems is default Evictions, which I will sort of go over a little bit as an introduction.",10,,
69,0.97,544.477,562.828,"When we come to the panel, and after the panel, we will hear from city council staff about the right to Council Lienales slice or a possible vote and finally the committee will vote on four reappointment to the Seattle Renters' Commission.",10,,
70,0.97,562.828,577.009,"Before we begin we have public comment and I will be reading the names of each person who has signed up for public comment, and everybody who signed up should please note that we have a minute for each of you.",10,,

76,0.97,610.042,622.822,I wanted to urge the Council members you know that we really need to pass challenge legislation for right to a public counsel for Renters facing Eviction.,11,,
77,0.97,622.822,635.434,"I live 27th and Cherry a block away from the gas fire the other day and a lot of my neighbors, who you know I have talked to have lost their jobs and have rent building up.",11,,

80,0.97,643.943,659.258,"A lot of landlords already have been exploiting loopholes in the law, and you know, in cities where the right to counsel has been passed, Evictions have gone down significantly.",11,,
81,0.97,659.258,664.563,We need the strongest possible version of this bill.,11,,
82,0.97,664.563,665.331,"Thank you, Dan.",12,,
83,0.97,665.331,669.035,"Next we have Angie Gerald, followed by Brett Waller.",12,,

89,0.97,692.124,708.107,I'm speaking today to confirm our concerns are playing out and city council's actions are greatly intensifying the fleeing of small landlord from the Seattle market.,13,,

107,0.97,818.717,828.494,"I think the suggestion of an expiration date is insidious, given Evictions don't have an expiration date.",17,,
108,0.97,828.494,834.6,And guaranteeing representation where defendants could have lives ruined is a basic feature of December mock Crassry.,17,,
109,0.97,834.6,846.879,A right to counsel with an expiration date is a right at all.,17,,

336,0.97,2182.713,2186.951,"We are a community innocent of refugees of 32,000 people.",67,,
337,0.97,2186.951,2204.368,"We are asking to amend King County's action lab plan to include the aircraft emissions in the greenhouse gas targets, include beacon Hill worth with the Puget sound clean air, Rehab Council to add aircraft transportation.",67,,
338,0.97,2204.368,2205.836,I will send this letter to you.,67,,
339,0.97,2205.836,2210.274,"Thank you, stay safe and please continue to be courageous.",67,,
340,0.97,2210.274,2210.875,Thank you.,68,,
341,0.97,2210.875,2220.451,"Absolutely, we will be talking about the Sustainability issues in the coming committee meetings that were scheduled for March and April.",68,,
342,0.97,2220.451,2229.627,We have Mindy Lee followed by Bruce and then Dustin Ray.,69,,
343,0.97,2229.627,2231.195,"Go ahead, Mindy.",69,,
344,0.97,2231.195,2239.804,"Sorry, Mindy is not present, so we'll go with Bruce and then Dustin Ray.",70,,
345,0.97,2239.804,2256.12,"Bruce, you'll have to hit Star 6 to Unmute yourself.",71,,
346,0.97,2256.12,2256.52,,72,,
347,0.97,2256.52,2258.089,Maybe let's go to Dustin.,73,,
348,0.97,2258.089,2268.432,Dustin Ray and then we'll come back to Bruce.,73,,
349,0.97,2268.432,2268.933,"Go ahead, Dustin.",73,,
350,0.97,2268.933,2275.706,"Good morning, council chair and members of the committee.",74,,
351,0.97,2275.706,2276.24,I'm Dustin Ray.,74,,
352,0.97,2276.24,2278.976,Right now I'm homeless and staying at tent city three.,74,,
353,0.97,2278.976,2282.38,The reason I'm homeless is the rent in Seattle is too high.,74,,
354,0.97,2282.38,2289.987,I have rented several times but it is almost impossible when you have a low income.,74,,
355,0.97,2289.987,2297.194,Extending the rent moratorium and Council legislation because Seattle might throw out another 5000 residents on the street and that would be absurd.,74,,
356,0.97,2297.194,2299.497,Tenants should not be subjected to homelessness.,74,,
357,0.97,2299.497,2300.064,It isn't always safe.,74,,
358,0.97,2300.064,2315.446,"Lots of people get sick and can't work while homeless and what is more important is homeless people find it harder for everyone there will be more competition for resources, there will be a lot more people in tents and public places.",74,,
359,0.97,2315.446,2319.016,That is why a long moratorium on Evictions is good.,74,,
360,0.97,2319.016,2323.087,It will help us find a humane alternative.,74,,
361,0.97,2323.087,2324.889,Thank you for listening.,74,,
362,0.97,2324.889,2325.756,Thank you.,75,,
363,0.97,2325.756,2326.324,To inform everyone.,75,,
364,0.97,2326.324,2333.631,Mindy and Bruce are shown as not present for now.,75,,
365,0.97,2333.631,2334.999,Macarthur and Karen and Benjamin.,75,,

367,0.97,2335.733,2336.567,My name is Emily.,77,,
368,0.97,2336.567,2342.64,I'm a Renter in district 2. and I'm urging all committee members to pass this legislation immediately.,77,,
369,0.97,2342.64,2348.379,We have seen that there is a precedent and that that precedent works.,77,,
370,0.97,2348.379,2349.213,Evictions have dropped dramatically.,77,,
371,0.97,2349.213,2350.681,That is what we need to be aiming for.,77,,
372,0.97,2350.681,2356.921,And the idea there need to be some sort of built in end date is absolutely absurd.,77,,
373,0.97,2356.921,2366.63,The only connotation in which I could think you could even begin to fathom an end date is when we have full availability of social housing and zero homelessness in the city.,77,,
374,0.97,2366.63,2379.543,"And even then the basic right of having the ability to defend yourself in a court of law, when you are being evicted is not something that needs some sort of Countdown clock on it.",77,,
375,0.97,2379.543,2394.792,"And further concerns about small landlord, I would like to add that a couple of us want leading the way not just canceled rent but canceling mortgages for small landlords.",78,,
376,0.97,2394.792,2414.678,"I heard earlier a Speaker from the multi family housing Association, I would like to reiterate he is a member of a notorious lobbying firm for big landlords and as mentioned they are the ones that are Evicting and that is why they are trying to show concerns or doubt this legislation is necessary.",78,,
377,0.97,2414.678,2415.78,Thank you.,79,,
378,0.97,2415.78,2428.659,We have Karen gram Bling and Benjamin is shown as not present so Michael.,79,,
379,0.97,2428.659,2428.893,Karen?,79,,
380,0.97,2428.893,2432.463,"Yes, this is Karen gram Bling.",80,,
381,0.97,2432.463,2433.664,Go ahead.,81,,
382,0.97,2433.664,2441.906,"I'm a resident of pine House village, which has been a Lifesaver for me but not everybody is going to be so fortunate.",82,,
383,0.97,2441.906,2450.681,As a formerly financially well off woman with a masters degree I never expected to be homeless.,82,,
384,0.97,2450.681,2451.148,But I am.,82,,
385,0.97,2451.148,2462.293,And provided legal counsel the city can expect to have far more problems with a tsunami of Unhoused voters and the rippling chain reaction the city already struggles to deal with.,82,,
386,0.97,2462.293,2465.93,An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.,82,,
387,0.97,2465.93,2472.336,Appreciate the efforts Council members want and others are making.,82,,
388,0.97,2472.336,2472.837,Thank you.,83,,
389,0.97,2472.837,2481.812,"So unless other people are showing up as Nonpresent show up, our last two speakers will be Michael and Sonia.",83,,
390,0.97,2481.812,2482.58,"Go ahead, Michael.",83,,
391,0.97,2482.58,2495.826,"My name is Michael, I am a Renter in district 3 and calling in support of the legislation for right to counsel and to extend the moratorium past the end of the year.",84,,
392,0.97,2495.826,2511.876,Once the pandemic subsides these problems will still be here and currently we are favoring corporate landlords over working class Renters and people in our community and city.,84,,
393,0.97,2511.876,2512.176,Thank you.,84,,
394,0.97,2512.176,2517.014,"Thank you, go ahead, Sonia.",85,,
395,0.97,2517.014,2518.215,"Hi, I'm Sonia.",86,,
396,0.97,2518.215,2525.523,"And as a small landlord, I support counsel member's Sawant's legislation and urge the Council to vote yes.",86,,
397,0.97,2525.523,2529.693,"I have worked with tenants to ensure no one has been evicted in this pandemic, really ever.",86,,
398,0.97,2529.693,2533.898,These are homes and two of our tenants are actually there for 30 years.,86,,
399,0.97,2533.898,2551.649,"But not everyone is in my position, so it is crucial that the petition to extend the Evictions moratoriums and from Council member Sawant's office clearly States struggling small businesses should also be protected during Covid-19.",86,,
400,0.97,2551.649,2560.424,When the Cheesecake factory announced they wouldn't pay rent they got a $200 million investment.,86,,
401,0.97,2560.424,2560.758,No Eviction.,86,,
402,0.97,2560.758,2561.725,They worked it out.,86,,
403,0.97,2561.725,2567.831,"Instead of nickel and Diming the rest of us, make big business pay for this.",86,,
404,0.97,2567.831,2575.272,"Instead of guaranteeing the right to counsel, it just means the evicted tenant also gets a lawyer, which the small landlord doesn't pay for.",86,,
405,0.97,2575.272,2579.643,I fail to see how allowing a right will cause small landlords to sell their properties.,86,,
406,0.97,2579.643,2589.853,"If you are struggling, you need to get involved in our movement so we can cancel rent and mortgage.",86,,
407,0.97,2589.853,2590.554,Thank you.,87,,
408,0.97,2590.554,2595.559,"That was the last of our speakers who were present, I'm not seeing any change.",87,,
409,0.97,2595.559,2603.067,So I will close public comment for now and we will move to our first agenda item in the committee.,87,,
410,0.97,2603.067,2611.175,Which is the community panel by first thanking all the people who spoke in public comment.,87,,
411,0.97,2611.175,2611.709,I really appreciate that.,87,,

435,0.97,2737.968,2747.678,"I believe the housing justice project folks will be doing their presentation first if I'm right about that, go ahead.",102,,
436,0.97,2747.678,2759.389,"Molly and Amy, if you want to start.",103,,
437,0.97,2759.389,2767.564,Let me share my screen.,104,,
438,0.97,2767.564,2772.069,"So as we said, my name is Molly Goff.",105,,
439,0.97,2772.069,2779.81,And joining me in this presentation will be Amy a social worker of Hjpreponderance.,105,,
440,0.97,2779.81,2782.379,P. our presentation today is about Seattle Eviction filings in 2019.,105,,
441,0.97,2782.379,2783.514,Thank you for having us.,105,,
442,0.97,2783.514,2789.386,"We are excited to be here and Amy, do you want to start?",105,,
443,0.97,2789.386,2790.687,"Yes, thanks Molly.",106,,
444,0.97,2790.687,2790.888,Okay.,106,,
445,0.97,2790.888,2800.564,"So first we have as an overview of the Evictions filed in Seattle in 2019, there were just under 1200 Evictions filed.",106,,
446,0.97,2800.564,2807.237,And this number includes the formal Evictions that were filed in the court.,106,,
447,0.97,2807.237,2816.78,"First table shows the primarily basis for these Evictions, the vast majority were based on nonpayment of rental at 86%.",106,,
448,0.97,2816.78,2823.053,"After that the next most frequent basis were lease violations, which made up about 8% of Evictions.",106,,
449,0.97,2823.053,2831.428,"The other table shows the breakdown of Eviction filings by race, compared to racial demographics in Seattle overall.",106,,
450,0.97,2831.428,2842.206,The race demographics for the Eviction filings are estimates from the model the same model used in the 2018 losing home report.,106,,
451,0.97,2842.206,2852.749,Black tenants were Overrepresented in Eviction filings at 28% compared to 8.3% in the overall Seattle population.,106,,
452,0.97,2852.749,2855.219,All right.,107,,
453,0.97,2855.219,2860.891,So this next slide is the top 10 plaintiffs we were seeing in the 2018 Eviction filings.,107,,
454,0.97,2860.891,2865.329,For our data analysis the plaintiff with his recorded in the same manner it was listed on the complain.,107,,
455,0.97,2865.329,2877.708,"This means the graph is showing the number of filings for specific buildings for property management companies, but not necessarily all the properties in Seattle.",107,,
456,0.97,2877.708,2884.448,"So for example, you can see that GR Edowntowner is number one Anden Dorff is number six.",107,,
457,0.97,2884.448,2895.259,On the graph both buildings are owned by the Goodman real estate and are listed on the GR Ewebsite but showing as two separate columns on this graph.,107,,
458,0.97,2895.259,2899.73,"So knowing that, we needed a second analysis.",107,,
459,0.97,2899.73,2906.27,"When the building specific information is removed from the plaintiff name, in total the GR Efilings in Seattle rise to 74.",107,,
460,0.97,2906.27,2912.943,So still number one and that is including there's GR Ebuildings.,107,,
461,0.97,2912.943,2919.316,"And thrive communities incorporated, which is another commercial entity comes in at number three, with 29 filings.",107,,
462,0.97,2919.316,2934.865,"However, looking back at the graph as is right now, the most common basis for these top 10 plaintiffs, for the Eviction filings was nonpayment of rent at 83.5%.",107,,
463,0.97,2934.865,2936.9,The second was lease violations at 13.5%.,107,,
464,0.97,2936.9,2944.041,Another notable thing for both of the GR Ebuildings.,107,,
465,0.97,2944.041,2948.145,"Downtowner, their filings combined were 97% about nonpayment of rent.",107,,
466,0.97,2948.145,2967.331,"You know, kind of continuing that same trend, another thing to note is that the second two plaintiffs on this graph, Seattle housing authority and Capitol Hill housing, these both represent multiple properties while GR E, Downtowner, which is number one is just a single building.",107,,
467,0.97,2967.331,2978.342,"And Lastly, another thing to note is that all of the top 10 plaintiffs you can see there are no individual landlords in this list.",107,,
468,0.97,2978.342,2987.25,Next we have data for both the default rate and the housing justice project success rate in keeping tenants housed.,108,,
469,0.97,2987.25,2995.325,This is based on Seattle Evictions filed in September and October of 2019.,108,,
470,0.97,2995.325,3005.068,"In this time period of 6% defaulted either by failing to respond to the Evictions summons, failing to appear at their hearing or by violating a previously entered stipulation.",108,,
471,0.97,3005.068,3017.614,In the same time period the housing justice project had a 53.3% you can assess rate in keeping a tenant housed when involved in an E vision case.,108,,
472,0.97,3017.614,3029.292,"When both Hj.P., and home based financial assistance program were involved the tenancy was saved 84.6% of the time.",108,,
473,0.97,3029.292,3032.963,"Without Hj.P., tenants Rem356 Anda House 97.7% of the time.",108,,
474,0.97,3032.963,3040.871,So based on this data we can estimate how many households could avoid conviction with the right to counsel.,108,,
475,0.97,3040.871,3044.508,Seattle has approximately 1200 filed Evictions cases each year.,108,,
476,0.97,3044.508,3053.283,"Of these, we estimate between 48 to 66% will default, which is between 576 and 792 households.",108,,
477,0.97,3053.283,3067.731,"If these households have been able to access legal services, with Hj.P., success rate of 53%, an additional 307 to 422 could avoid Eviction each year.",108,,
478,0.97,3067.731,3084.081,"With the added benefit of financial assistance, considering Hj.P .'s and hope basis success rate of 84% we estimate an additional 487 to 670 households could avoid Eviction each year.",108,,
479,0.97,3084.081,3093.056,"That means testing could Detrimentally impact these estimates, because it would serve as a barrier to tenants being able to act as these services.",108,,
480,0.97,3099.162,3099.396,.,108,,
481,0.97,3099.396,3100.33,"Oh, sorry.",109,,
482,0.97,3100.33,3103.2,"Those are all the slides you had, right?",109,,
483,0.97,3103.2,3103.433,Yes.,110,,
484,0.97,3103.433,3104.0,Thank you.,110,,
485,0.97,3104.0,3105.335,Thank you so much.,111,,
486,0.97,3105.335,3109.539,I have a couple of questions to ask about this.,111,,
487,0.97,3109.539,3115.512,But I wanted to open it up for other Council members.,111,,
488,0.97,3115.512,3137.3,"Committee members, if you have questions pleas either speak up and I'll call on you or use the raised hand in the zoom feature in zoom, either way.",111,,
489,0.97,3137.3,3138.368,To question these Presenters.,111,,
490,0.97,3138.368,3145.809,I don't see any Council members wanting to speak at this moment.,111,,
491,0.97,3145.809,3148.211,"But anytime, please let me know.",111,,
492,0.97,3148.211,3153.083,"I was wondering one is obviously, again this is no surprise, because we have seen the data before.",111,,
493,0.97,3153.083,3159.089,But I was just wondering what your thoughts were on this.,111,,
494,0.97,3159.089,3165.161,"Why do we see the black community, our African-American community being impacted so much by Eviction?",111,,
495,0.97,3165.161,3171.001,"At four times more than four times the rate, compared to others, for example?",111,,
496,0.97,3171.001,3180.61,"What is your view, from having experience of legally defending you know, clients or facing Evictions, what do you think is going on here?",111,,
497,0.97,3180.61,3184.214,Needless to say it is really stunning.,111,,
498,0.97,3184.214,3186.182,"And clearly, it makes it a racial justice issue as well.",111,,
499,0.97,3186.182,3192.889,I think there is a good question and there is a really lot to talk about there.,112,,
500,0.97,3192.889,3199.329,"Number one, a lot of people are aware that there are those who own homes and those who don't.",112,,
501,0.97,3199.329,3202.232,And oftentimes that line is separated by race.,112,,
502,0.97,3202.232,3228.224,"So in King County, while 70% of black residents rely on rental housing as their primary residents compared to 30% of white residents who rely on housing, I think are from generations and years and years and years of racial disparities and sort of racist policies, we have basically created a system where a lot of black households have to rely on rental housing.",112,,
503,0.97,3228.224,3232.162,Whereas a lot of white households are able to own homes.,112,,
504,0.97,3232.162,3243.807,"So when we talk about Renter policies, we are effectively talking about protecting black and Latin groups.",112,,
505,0.97,3243.807,3249.379,"Frankly when you hear the things about problematic, they think we all have this image in our head.",112,,
506,0.97,3249.379,3255.251,But a lot of big problems the people who reason are frankly black households.,112,,
507,0.97,3255.251,3258.822,That is why rental pro Techs are a racial justice issue.,112,,
508,0.97,3258.822,3266.663,"Just under state law, if you fall behind on your rent, you have days to pay up.",112,,
509,0.97,3266.663,3270.166,On your mortgage you have 190 days.,112,,
510,0.97,3270.166,3272.702,We have Prioritized one type of housing over the other.,112,,
511,0.97,3272.702,3276.172,One is used by black versus one that is used by white.,112,,
512,0.97,3276.172,3289.886,"The short of it is, a lot of Renters have to rely on housing are more likely to be evicted.",112,,
513,0.97,3289.886,3296.359,To be more vulnerable involving the fact that most Evictions happen for a month or less in rent.,112,,
514,0.97,3296.359,3306.302,"It is usually because of one temporary unemployment issue, one medical emergency, one death in the family that brings it to bear.",112,,
515,0.97,3306.302,3311.908,The income inequality instability in our system and the racial division it has definitely shows up in the data we have seen.,112,,
516,0.97,3311.908,3312.275,Thank you.,113,,
517,0.97,3312.275,3316.012,"That was very, very useful to hear.",113,,
518,0.97,3316.012,3320.517,"And Yeah, as you said, it is very much comes down to who ends up renting.",113,,
519,0.97,3320.517,3347.51,"And I think that is not only important, as you said, in terms of looking at it, looking at how it falls along racial lines, but also, given the fact that if you look at it from the younger generation, more and more of a proportion of the younger generation is going to be renting just because they simply, we are not seeing the economy Replicate those middle class standards of living that maybe our parents had.",113,,
520,0.97,3347.51,3348.511,So I think this question.,113,,
521,0.97,3348.511,3363.76,"Renters right in general and the right to Council really comes into play and I appreciate you saying that it is dog whistling when we say, I'm not sure I remember exactly what we said.",113,,
522,0.97,3363.76,3369.132,But Renters are bad actors or something like that.,113,,
523,0.97,3369.132,3376.439,"The other, another question is, what is the average cost of representing a tenant?",113,,
524,0.97,3376.439,3404.167,"And if we could contrast that with the tapes of costs and so that the whole area of costs that the city and county in terms of costs, are paid by taxpayer revenues, that the city and county would encourage people, every time people are evicted, I know Ariana mentioned that.",113,,
525,0.97,3404.167,3411.741,"To talk about that, how that goes into also in terms of fiscal responsibility, kind of argument that Ariana was talking about.",114,,
526,0.97,3411.741,3413.243,I think that is a good question.,115,,
527,0.97,3413.243,3415.912,It is hard to give you a solid number.,115,,
528,0.97,3415.912,3417.58,We have been trying to.,115,,
529,0.97,3417.58,3428.658,But I would say probably on average our services cost $300 to $500 per household we help.,115,,
530,0.97,3428.658,3430.026,Household is multiple individuals.,115,,
531,0.97,3430.026,3435.899,"There is a lot of different estimates out there, different reports, depending on the ones you see.",115,,
532,0.97,3435.899,3447.811,"If somebody becomes homeless, it costs anywhere from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for that individual to be homeless.",115,,
533,0.97,3447.811,3455.885,"But to have the homelessness system compared to $300 to $500 to keep them out of it, I think the math is simple.",115,,
534,0.97,3455.885,3461.191,When we run a rental systems Pogue at United way called home days.,115,,
535,0.97,3461.191,3463.393,Our average aimed tends to be $1500 or $2000 to $3000.,115,,
536,0.97,3463.393,3466.029,That is not a lot of money.,115,,
537,0.97,3466.029,3481.678,"Again, even when you add that factor into the rental assistance fees, the small amount it costs for legal service provider or like Amy who is also a social worker to be able to help somebody stay housed.",115,,
538,0.97,3481.678,3492.555,"The math again on that $10,000 versus $3000 to $4000, to keep the rental aid, and keep the family housed and make sure their rights are enforced and kept, I think the math is simple.",115,,
539,0.97,3492.555,3496.392,We really can't afford to have a lot of people lose their housing.,115,,
540,0.97,3496.392,3509.138,"And I think the other thing, too, about the numbers they projected, on average 1200 filed Evictions every year or 1200 households that face Eviction in Seattle every year and that is a lower number.",115,,
541,0.97,3509.138,3513.076,We don't know how many people are getting notices we don't have records of.,115,,
542,0.97,3513.076,3520.55,But it also doesn't take a lot for that to have a really huge impact on the homeless population.,115,,
543,0.97,3520.55,3527.056,"There is only 11,000 individuals based on the time count homeless in King County.",115,,
544,0.97,3527.056,3541.07,"So if you had just a couple thousand households being evicted, you are going to overwhelm the homelessness response system that is struggling, even as we all know, right now.",115,,
545,0.97,3541.07,3541.337,Right.,116,,
546,0.97,3541.337,3541.638,Absolutely.,116,,
547,0.97,3541.638,3552.348,I think that connection between preventing Evictions and the burden on the homelessness funds which are already too limited is a very important point.,116,,
548,0.97,3552.348,3584.814,"And I think the present nation the housing justice project and the sort of nationwide look that we have been able to take, thanks to you and John, and our last committee also showed the really interesting numbers in Baltimore, which was quoted by one of the people in public comment that in the 2020 study, found that investing $5.7 million in right to counsel legislation would save Baltimore and Maryland $35.6 million in emergency shelter Healthcare and Childcare.",116,,
549,0.97,3584.814,3596.659,"I think that is sort of important and on the other side, you have all the taxpayer money spent on the King County sheriff, carrying out the Eviction, all the money to run the Eviction court.",116,,
550,0.97,3596.659,3599.696,So I really appreciate that.,116,,
551,0.97,3599.696,3603.199,"And then now, we have a question from Councilwoman moralities, please go ahead.",116,,
552,0.97,3603.199,3605.335,Thank you.,117,,
553,0.97,3605.335,3609.372,Thanks to everyone who is presenting today.,117,,
554,0.97,3609.372,3613.042,"And Council member Sawant, you basically covered what I was going to say.",117,,
555,0.97,3613.042,3645.074,"In addition to the cost of having folks enter into the homeless system we have the health outcomes that result from people becoming homeless, their entry into the criminal legal system, kids, school absence and the impact that has on a family so you know, the figure from Boston doesn't surprise me and when you account for all of the ways in which a family might be impacted, it is huge.",117,,
556,0.97,3645.074,3645.875,Yeah.,117,,
557,0.97,3645.875,3646.542,"Yeah, absolutely.",118,,
558,0.97,3646.542,3652.315,"Really appreciate that Council men Morales, bringing in the costs that are not traditionally counted in terms of dollars.",118,,
559,0.97,3652.315,3659.489,"What is the impact on a child whose community of friend and school is uprooted, who misses school days, all of that.",118,,
560,0.97,3659.489,3662.792,I mean those are things you cannot put a price tag on.,118,,
561,0.97,3662.792,3675.872,"And that is very important to take into account as to on by, as a city Council, we need to pass these basic Renters rights laws.",118,,
562,0.97,3675.872,3678.241,I'm not seeing any other Council member?,118,,
563,0.97,3678.241,3679.042,Go ahead.,119,,
564,0.97,3679.042,3679.575,Council member Lewis.,119,,
565,0.97,3679.575,3686.215,"Guys, I wanted to jump in on that point.",120,,
566,0.97,3686.215,3693.523,"I appreciate Edmond's recitation of all the benefits to caseload and other places, when you make these investments.",120,,
567,0.97,3693.523,3695.758,And legal representation.,120,,
568,0.97,3695.758,3700.263,So I think this is more of a question for our central staff.,120,,
569,0.97,3700.263,3712.375,"I wonder, is there a way we could try to quantify, based on what we know in Seattle, what we could expect the impact to be from this legislation here for us?",120,,
570,0.97,3712.375,3715.978,Based on those examples from other cities?,120,,
571,0.97,3715.978,3719.715,"Because we do have some, you know, these illustrative examples from other places.",120,,
572,0.97,3719.715,3732.695,"But it would be nice to be able to, with confidence, stand by some estimates of what we could expect to see, based on those experiences here.",120,,
573,0.97,3732.695,3742.004,"Yeah, so I would be happy to start putting together what those numbers might look like with the help of my colleagues and get back to you all.",121,,
574,0.97,3742.004,3748.01,That would be really helpful.,122,,
575,0.97,3748.01,3751.848,Thank you so much.,122,,
576,0.97,3751.848,3754.484,"Thank you, council member Lewis and Asha.",123,,
577,0.97,3754.484,3758.454,In the interest of time I'll move to the other panelists.,123,,
578,0.97,3758.454,3763.359,Feel free to ask questions or make comments on any part of the presentation.,123,,
579,0.97,3763.359,3764.794,It doesn't matter what the order is.,123,,
580,0.97,3764.794,3784.046,"So I would like to call on Ellen Miller now, to say a few words about what their experience has been in New York, which is one of the cities where right to counsel law has been passed and there is experience there.",123,,
581,0.97,3784.046,3784.78,Thank you.,124,,
582,0.97,3784.78,3785.181,I'm Ellen.,124,,
583,0.97,3785.181,3788.985,I'm Atent Organizer with Full- time tenant Union in New York City.,124,,
584,0.97,3788.985,3800.496,Formed to represent tenants under our corporate management company when a few dozens tenants who were laid off decided to rent strike and knew we would be safest if we were Electtively organized.,124,,
585,0.97,3800.496,3813.743,"One year in, full-time tenant Union is advocating along many on housing organizations for many of the same demands including rent cancellation, housing for the homeless and no Evictions during the pan.",124,,
586,0.97,3813.743,3825.221,"In a Capitalistsive them treated treats housing a commodity, all housing issues and in Particularee victims are about landlords Leveraging power over tenants to maximize their profits.",124,,
587,0.97,3825.221,3848.144,"Every single one of New York city's top 20 worst Evictors owns more than $18 million of property, more than half own more than $100 million and three are multiple billions, joining the ranks of Billionaires nationwide who have collected another trillion dollars over the course of the pandemic alone.",124,,
588,0.97,3848.144,3856.152,"Allowing them to prey on low income black and Brown tenants, Undocumented immigrants and women who Evictions disproportionately affect.",124,,
589,0.97,3856.152,3863.893,So it is really no wonder are that at least half of tenant who are evicted would not be if they had access to legal aid.,125,,
590,0.97,3863.893,3871.634,This power dynamic that allows corporate landlords to unfairly leverage the system is unconscionable.,125,,
591,0.97,3871.634,3877.44,The ability for tenants to access good legal counsel is one critical step in leveling the playing field.,125,,
592,0.97,3877.44,3891.387,New York City won first in the nation right to counsel for tenants facing Eviction in 2017 through committed coalition based mass struggle and Beven within its five year phase in the numbers already speak volumes.,125,,
593,0.97,3891.387,3895.658,Evictions have been on the decline since some public representations for tenants first began in 2013.,125,,
594,0.97,3895.658,3902.365,But with the right to counsel legislation that guaranteed representation the numbers only get more promising.,125,,
595,0.97,3902.365,3910.039,Evictions and right to counsel zip codes have declined by 29% since the law was implemented.,125,,
596,0.97,3910.039,3913.676,A greater decrease than Nonright to counsel zip codes.,125,,
597,0.97,3913.676,3923.586,In 2019 Evictions in New York City dropped 15% and overall 80% of New York City tenants facing Evictions remained this their homes.,125,,
598,0.97,3923.586,3927.29,Right to counsel punches above its weight economically as well.,125,,
599,0.97,3927.29,3933.963,"Out of New York city's $92.5 billion budget for the 2020 fiscal year, one-tenth of a percent went to right to counsel.",125,,
600,0.97,3933.963,3947.41,This is in contrast to the 12% of the budget that went to the New York City police Department which has a consistent track record of harming tenants by siding with landlords during illegal lockouts.,125,,
601,0.97,3947.41,3952.848,New York city's right to counsel was signed into law with a phase in by zip cold code.,125,,
602,0.97,3952.848,3965.261,"During the pandemic, as New York has faced some of the nation's highest unemployment levels and see the contraction of most of the Industries central to the livelihood of New York's working class these restrictions have been rolled back.",125,,
603,0.97,3965.261,3974.87,"Right to counsel attorneys are being assigned to all cases, including emergency and maintenance requests, regardless of income, location or immigration status.",125,,
604,0.97,3974.87,3982.044,And as a tenant Organizer the impact of this universal right to counsel during the pandemic cannot be overstated.,125,,
605,0.97,3982.044,4004.4,"Right to counsel has been invaluable for fighting landlord malpractice of all sorts of the for example Full- time tenant Union has been able to keep consistent contact with a legal aid lawyer whom we continue Sult with issues, informal Evictions involving egregious intimidation Tacks ticks.",125,,
606,0.97,4004.4,4023.319,"Most importantly, universal right to counsel actively encourages the most vulnerable tenants to utilize it by removing confusion around the sluggish and Overcomplicated bureaucracy of means test that go so often causes individuals in highly stressful crisis situations to simply give up, even if they would be eligible.",125,,
607,0.97,4023.319,4037.733,"In contrast strict means testing measures attached to New York's rent relief program meant only $40 million of the allocated $100 million were spent on the program, yet 60% of the applicants were denied access.",125,,
608,0.97,4037.733,4049.945,"New York State rolled back its universal moratorium but the complicated application process has meant that over the three months this plan has been in place, only 9000 tenants statewide have applied for the program.",125,,
609,0.97,4049.945,4058.354,"A number which tenants, landlords and lawmakers alike recognize does not remotely reflect the need.",125,,
610,0.97,4058.354,4065.494,Universal right to counsel addresses tenants's most immediate and urgent need as a crucial opponent in combatting the balance of power.,125,,
611,0.97,4065.494,4067.963,This is also just the first step.,125,,
612,0.97,4067.963,4087.783,"The next step for Seattle, New York City and the rest of the country must be taking on the enormous debt crisis facing tenants, which if left Unaddressed will lead to waves of Evictions in the near future and exacerbate the crease Sis and will further the racial wealth gap for generations to come.",125,,
613,0.97,4087.783,4094.757,The housing crisis did not start with this pandemic so we cannot rely on MSA sons of back to normal Toen it.,125,,
614,0.97,4094.757,4106.569,In addition to right to counsel legislation we need a moratorium guaranteed to last until one year after the pandemic to ensure no one is forced from their home.,125,,
615,0.97,4106.569,4119.582,We need to universally cancel rent for all tenants and provide assistance for struggling small scale landlords while corporates take the hit they can afford.,125,,
616,0.97,4119.582,4128.29,Beyond the pandemic we must continue to fight for instituting rent control and ultimately we must fight to put an end to for profit housing all together.,125,,
617,0.97,4128.29,4140.202,Under a capitalist system any basic human need treated as a commodity will be exploited by the ruling class to drive profits with as little regard for the human expense as we can let them get away.,125,,
618,0.97,4140.202,4146.609,And we cannot let them get away with it any longer.,125,,
619,0.97,4146.609,4146.909,Solidarity.,125,,
620,0.97,4146.909,4147.376,Thank you.,126,,
621,0.97,4147.376,4172.768,"That was very bold, Chock full of really, really useful information about not only the right to counsel law and how it is working in New York but also a very strong case statistically based case against lap holes but I also really appreciate the commitment you clearly bring for the Renters you represent at full-time tenants Union.",126,,
622,0.97,4172.768,4179.008,"Similarly, I would like to welcome Kate Rubin for a few years and after that Violet.",126,,
623,0.97,4179.008,4184.346,"And once we hear from all of them, we'll open it up for questions and comments.",126,,
624,0.97,4184.346,4185.047,"Go ahead, Kate.",126,,

628,0.97,4196.292,4202.064,People who are terrified of what is to DOM upon the end of the Eviction moratorium.,127,,
629,0.97,4202.064,4211.907,Many of them are convinced that is the only thing that is preventing them from becoming homelessness.,127,,
630,0.97,4211.907,4216.946,I received permission from a Rentter in Lake see city to share her story.,127,,
631,0.97,4216.946,4223.852,Claire lost her job as a bartender and server at the beginning of the pandemic.,127,,
632,0.97,4223.852,4231.427,Because she was Immunocompromised she has been unable to take a job that doesn't jeopardize her help.,127,,

697,0.97,4626.254,4643.105,"Basically rents are too high, minimum wages are too low and even if I was working full-time I wouldn't make enough to pay three times owed for rent which I realize you need to be able to pay electricity, water sewer and garbage, insurance, gas, phone bill, et cetera.",133,,

701,0.97,4684.813,4690.852,I believe Paige's zoom has frozen where I feel like I would be less likely to be taken advantage of.,134,,
702,0.97,4690.852,4702.064,Maybe if I had had right to counsel back then I would have also been sent in a better direction than I would have and not ended up.,134,,

724,0.97,4799.528,4812.607,"And your story also shows the often unseen or invisible issue of how Renters are Intimidted into leaving, so it really is a strong case, as you noted.",138,,
725,0.97,4812.607,4824.586,Of how legal advice could help so many Renters in a similar situation.,138,,

733,0.97,4846.641,4848.91,And Edmond brought up a good point.,139,,
734,0.97,4848.91,4851.947,"People always ask me, why is there a homeless problem?",139,,
735,0.97,4851.947,4857.219,Why are there people on the streets?,139,,
736,0.97,4857.219,4874.703,"And it goes back to racist and discriminatory, that has been set up by a system that, if we want to get rid of racism in housing or whatever, is breaking down this system that has been placed to oppress people.",139,,
737,0.97,4874.703,4879.14,"African-American, as you see is the highest rate of number of Evictions.",139,,

739,0.97,4887.582,4892.654,And a lot of the tenants who lose their place really are afraid.,139,,
740,0.97,4892.654,4903.665,Sometimes they don't know about housing justice project and what we try to do is actually send people to housing justice project or called Northwest justice project.,139,,
741,0.97,4903.665,4911.106,At some point the tenants's Union is there as a buffer to help tenants to advocate for this.,139,,
742,0.97,4911.106,4917.612,Sometimes we reach out to the landlords and sometimes we take the means of protesting.,139,,
743,0.97,4917.612,4925.987,"But having this in place right to counsel, will help a lot of people.",139,,
744,0.97,4925.987,4930.058,The majority of people that will help are communities of color.,139,,
745,0.97,4930.058,4933.929,Those are the highest rates of Eviction in our state.,139,,
746,0.97,4933.929,4934.396,That is a fact.,139,,

749,0.97,4938.066,4953.782,"As a woman of color, I see discrimination in everything that we do and I think this is the opportunity for us as people as advocates, as coming together and really asking the Council members to pass this legislation right to counsel.",139,,
750,0.97,4953.782,4960.422,It would help save a lot of people and it will lessen the people who are on the streets.,139,,

753,0.97,4970.398,4973.134,It got worse after 2015.,139,,
754,0.97,4973.134,4975.737,What I'm here to speak about is this right to counsel.,139,,

759,0.97,4996.658,4997.625,Or how can we pass this?,139,,
760,0.97,4997.625,5002.063,"It is a human rights, it is a moral obligation for all of us.",139,,
761,0.97,5002.063,5007.235,To really get the heart of why we need this.,139,,
762,0.97,5007.235,5009.871,"And why, what can we do together?",139,,
763,0.97,5009.871,5011.239,"We are, right now, gearing up.",139,,

765,0.97,5020.148,5026.521,But I'm going to keep asking to extend the moratorium to the end of until June or maybe to the end of the year.,139,,
766,0.97,5026.521,5036.297,"What we want to do is you know, we know that landlords are, you know, it is noted they have sued the governor about the moratorium.",139,,
767,0.97,5036.297,5045.507,"I just think right now, it takes all of us to stop to extend the moratorium, ask the Mayor to extend it until 2021.",139,,
768,0.97,5045.507,5047.375,"And right now, we haven't heard anything statewide.",139,,
769,0.97,5047.375,5053.748,"I have been asking around, people that are close to the governor, and really anxious.",139,,
770,0.97,5053.748,5060.522,Because what is going to happen on March 31 and the moratorium ends?,139,,
771,0.97,5060.522,5066.694,You'll see a lot of people who are in fear right now of losing their place.,139,,
772,0.97,5066.694,5071.966,"If we pass this legislation, it will help many more families.",139,,
773,0.97,5071.966,5080.642,And the families that housing justice project and all are legal advocates for people will help people stay this their homes.,139,,

777,0.97,5100.628,5106.668,"Because racial discrimination has been something that I have seen over and over, even working at the tenants Union.",139,,
778,0.97,5106.668,5109.204,It is something that has been set up.,139,,
779,0.97,5109.204,5112.073,It is something I always talk about.,139,,

784,0.97,5128.556,5143.972,And I think sometimes we have to call it and name it and say it.,139,,

794,0.97,5231.259,5237.565,"Thank you, and thank you to everyone who has spoken so far on the panel.",141,,
795,0.97,5237.565,5245.807,I think it is so important.,141,,
796,0.97,5245.807,5256.618,My name is Bia and I've been a Renter in Seattle for 3 years and now I rent from thrive communities and Capitol Hill and one of the top 10 plaintiffs taking Renters to court in Seattle.,141,,
797,0.97,5256.618,5280.475,During the pandemic I've been an Organizer for much of last year and I had the opportunity to talk to dozens of Renters on any given week at socially distanced tables while doing phone baking and other engagement with Renters and helpful people deal directly with the pandemic.,141,,
798,0.97,5280.475,5283.511,What's clear to talking from people and hearing from everyone who has spoken today is how dire the situation is for Renters in Seattle now.,141,,
799,0.97,5283.511,5284.445,No doubt about the crisis we are facing.,141,,
800,0.97,5284.445,5312.573,"We know from reading the news every day that ordinary people have suffered for over a year, not only a deadly pandemic which has taken the lives of friends and families and community members, but workers and mentors have lost income or lost their jobs completely which has wiped out what little financial security they may have had and put thousands of Renters deep into debt and forced many more onto the streets.",141,,
801,0.97,5312.573,5335.43,"Working previously for campaigns on rent control and affordable housing, as a Renter in Seattle for several years now, we all know the Covid-19 pandemic is by no means where the crisis have begun and Renters have been struggling to pay their bills long before March of last year.",141,,
802,0.97,5335.43,5343.771,The pandemic and economic downturn have exacerbated what was already an untenable situation for many Renters who live and still live a paycheck away from not being able to pay rent or other bills and facing Eviction.,141,,
803,0.97,5343.771,5354.549,You hear that time and time again on the phones and after talking to Renters in the city.,141,,
804,0.97,5354.549,5360.388,It's important to talk about how affections are not only a shattering of a person's financial future but dramatic and violent and something that comes out in conversations with people.,141,,
805,0.97,5360.388,5372.9,"We also know so much of the data and research backs this up, as we have heard from some of the other Presenters.",141,,
806,0.97,5372.9,5385.046,"Evictions ripped families apart, cause profound psychological harm to adults and children alike, and leave what can be lifelong effects.",141,,
807,0.97,5385.046,5396.891,"As Councilmember Sawant and others have spoken to, Evictions and the trauma they cause while disproportionately on women and people of color and the vast majority of King County residents are homeless or some die as a consequence.",141,,
808,0.97,5396.891,5415.643,"The most immediate thing that Councilmembers can do is give peace of mind to families and ordinary people many of whom are generally burdened with the overwhelming fear of losing everything they need to survive and on top of that losing any hope of stability and safety, and for many not just for themselves, but also for their children.",141,,
809,0.97,5415.643,5427.488,"Getting Renters in Seattle the right to Council without means testing produce Evictions, mitigate trauma and is absolutely necessary.",141,,
810,0.97,5427.488,5438.199,"I have heard over recent months from Renters in Seattle speaks to the clear and obvious need to shore up the basic rights of Renters, that folks in the city depend upon.",141,,
811,0.97,5438.199,5462.523,"I'm having conversations with so many Seattle Renters and real support for the interconnected demands to improve their lives, and the demands that Councilmember and her office I have been fighting for during this crisis, I spoke to a Renter recently who lives in the central district and said she lost her job in December and have been living on her Savings and small unemployment benefits since then.",141,,
812,0.97,5462.523,5468.496,She was scared and didn't know what she would do because her rental debt was piling up and will loose her home when the moratorium ends at the end of the month.,141,,
813,0.97,5468.496,5492.019,"Despite this incredible stress but also because of it, this Renter understood how important the issues are and wanted to get involved and donated a few dollars to help the movement to cancel rent and fight to extend the moratorium because she recognized it the only way she will avoid getting evicted.",141,,
814,0.97,5492.019,5497.391,A few months ago I also happen to speak with a small landlord who shared his three tenants have been unable to pay rents for months after losing jobs.,141,,
815,0.97,5497.391,5510.605,His financial situation as their landlord is strained but like many small landlords which we heard from this morning he recognize it's not the fault of his tenants in small landlords and tenants need relief from the city.,141,,
816,0.97,5510.605,5519.647,He supported the demand for enormous corporate landlords to pay for the growing rent and mortgage debt that tenants and small landlords can't possibly afford to pay.,141,,
817,0.97,5519.647,5537.198,"Much like those conversations, I have heard consistent support for extending the Eviction moratorium for the demand to cancel rent and that's for those lost incomes during the pandemic for the right to Council when they as ordinary people have no choice but to go against billion-dollar corporate land Lords in court.",141,,
818,0.97,5537.198,5558.853,"And ultimately, representation for all tenants facing Eviction is one step towards what is needed to make sure Renters and workers through no fault of their own lost their income and jobs to this crisis and ensure they don't have to pay to fix the crisis they did not create.",141,,
819,0.97,5563.291,5566.16,The big banks and corporate landlords are the ones who should be paying using the billions they have amassed since the pandemic began.,141,,
820,0.97,5566.16,5575.269,"I would like to end by joining many, many Renters, struggling homeowners and small businesses and calling on Councilmembers to support canceling rent, mortgage and utility payments for all those affected by the crisis.",141,,
821,0.97,5575.269,5575.569,Thank you.,141,,
822,0.97,5575.569,5613.841,"Thank you, Bia and thank you so much to all of our speakers who spoke with such passion and dedication which reflects the genuine dedication they feel towards the people they represent, either as people directly providing services or such as speakers like Bia who came into contact with Renters facing this crisis, and all the stories that you shared are extremely helpful and informative to the city council Committee on Renters rights to understand how this crisis is affecting various sections of our community.",142,,
823,0.97,5613.841,5637.465,"Obviously I want to open it up to questions and comments from Councilmembers, but what I will do is go ahead and read out the next agenda item because I feel like those two, the community panel discussion that just happened in the next item which is lending together organically so I will read the agenda item to our committee.",142,,
824,0.97,5637.465,5660.521,"This Council built 120007, ordinance relating to residential Evictions, guaranteeing the right to legal Council regardless of the ability to pay for any residential Renter in Seattle responding to an unlawful Detainer suit and adding a new section to the Seattle municipal code.",142,,
825,0.97,5660.521,5676.537,First I want to make a call for Councilmembers that if you have comments or questions for the panelists and after that I will have Asha Venkataraman from the Council legislation.,142,,
826,0.97,5676.537,5678.973,"Madam chair, I have a question for the panel.",143,,
827,0.97,5678.973,5679.273,Thank you.,143,,
828,0.97,5679.273,5720.715,"The question is for Elin and I appreciate your presentation about the experience in New York and how it can be instructed here but I am wondering if you could share a little bit about what the impact--first, tell us what the means testing threshold is in New York, and how that screening process sort of works in terms of how it is administered, because I think getting into the granular details can help shed some light on how some of those things can set up potential barriers.",143,,
829,0.97,5720.715,5726.187,I would like to learn a little bit more about New York's experience.,143,,
830,0.97,5726.187,5731.092,I think it is important context setting for what we are discussing.,143,,
831,0.97,5731.092,5736.397,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",144,,
832,0.97,5736.397,5762.123,"And to be fully honest, my interaction with the right to Council there has largely been during the pandemic after means testing was rolled back but prior to the pandemic means testing in terms of income was based on earned income and specifically the threshold was lower than New York city's minimum wage.",144,,
833,0.97,5762.123,5773.334,There were people making minimum wage who did not have the guaranteed access to legal Council that was publicly funded.,144,,
834,0.97,5773.334,5806.834,"It's clear that given the stagnation of minimum wage in comparison to inflation in New York and nationwide, there are lots of people above that income barrier who would not be able to afford a lawyer on their own, but who would not qualify, so that is one representative restriction of the means testing of right to Council threshold in New York.",144,,
835,0.97,5806.834,5827.888,"The other interesting one is integration status, that throughout various means tests Tenet bills during the pandemic there has been a constant battle we have been facing with means testing is trying to get Undocumented immigrants can access the services that they need on their own.",144,,
836,0.97,5827.888,5840.067,"But often times, tenants are not able to access them on their own and need to go through an agency because of lack of documentation.",144,,
837,0.97,5840.067,5853.847,Undocumented immigrants are some of the most vulnerable people in terms of working in informal economies where their job insecurity is higher than many people especially during the pandemic.,144,,
838,0.97,5853.847,5886.347,"And given the instability of economies during the pandemic, and then Additionally Undocumented tenants face lots of additional issues in the Eviction process that American citizens would not face and therefore the need for representation is even more clear for the right to representation without means testing.",144,,
839,0.97,5886.347,5886.714,Thank you.,145,,
840,0.97,5886.714,5890.451,I quick follow-up on that too.,145,,
841,0.97,5890.451,5895.055,"During the pandemic, there has been an adjustment to to the means testing thresholds.",145,,
842,0.97,5895.055,5897.558,That's correct.,146,,
843,0.97,5897.558,5910.404,"Prior to the pandemic, the means testing--I'm sorry, the Council legislation signed and 2017 was on a 5 year rollup by Z.I.P.",146,,
844,0.97,5910.404,5919.813,Code specifically which was fully rolled out to all Z.I.P.,146,,
845,0.97,5919.813,5920.18,Codes by 2022.,146,,
846,0.97,5920.18,5920.848,During the pandemic the Z.I.P.,146,,
847,0.97,5920.848,5926.153,Code restrictions and other income restrictions and documentation restrictions were rolled back.,146,,
848,0.97,5926.153,5927.821,Are those permanent or just for the Pendency of the pandemic emergency?,147,,
849,0.97,5927.821,5929.356,That's a good question.,148,,
850,0.97,5929.356,5936.497,My understanding is the Z.I.P.,148,,
851,0.97,5936.497,5944.204,Code restrictions would remain because it was planned to be rolled out by 2022 anyway.,148,,
852,0.97,5944.204,5949.843,I am not entirely sure about the income eligibility requirements.,148,,
853,0.97,5949.843,5962.556,"I imagine there will be some imperative to reinstate those after the pandemic, but of course, as Tenet organizers will fight to make sure the legislation remains universal.",148,,
854,0.97,5962.556,5969.33,"Just one more thing because I don't want to monopolize all the question time but it's been really helpful, and I appreciate you being here.",149,,
855,0.97,5969.33,5993.487,"Can you walk through to the extent that you are familiar with it, if I were a tenant in New York facing Eviction I wanted to take advantage of this, what are things I have to go and do and what are the wait times I can expect, what are the administrative processes?",149,,
856,0.97,5993.487,5994.822,Is an Online into I have to physically go somewhere?,149,,
857,0.97,5994.822,6000.561,How long until I know I have Council? How was the Council assigned?,149,,
858,0.97,6000.561,6002.096,Can you walk through some of those real quick just to get a sense?,149,,
859,0.97,6002.096,6013.64,I am just curious how exactly those systems work step-by-step to Deconstruct what some of the barriers are.,149,,
860,0.97,6013.64,6019.613,"Yeah, during the pandemic it is very straightforward.",150,,
861,0.97,6019.613,6040.434,Tenants are able to call our 311 city services line and will be automatically paired with a legal aid provider . basically once they are hooked up with he legal aid provider t conversation this continuing from there.,150,,
862,0.97,6040.434,6059.319,"Prior to the pandemic, with various means testing requirements, there would be an intermediary step in between a tenant calling the 311 number and then being paired with a lawyer which would increase rate times.",150,,
863,0.97,6059.319,6066.794,It would make for the possibility that a tenant would not get the legal representation at all.,150,,
864,0.97,6066.794,6068.395,"All right, thank you so much.",151,,
865,0.97,6068.395,6076.937,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis and thank you, Elin, for illuminating information.",152,,
866,0.97,6076.937,6089.116,I saw that Edmund had his zoom hand raised up and then down.,152,,
867,0.97,6089.116,6089.75,Do you want to respond also?,152,,
868,0.97,6089.75,6110.137,"I helped with the Rollout in New York City prior to coming to Seattle and right to Council in the Bronx and I will say means testing was a logistical hardship . particularly because what we had to do when we started the Rollout as we would have to go into each courtroom and call everyone's name on the calendar that they and asked them, do you want an attorney?",153,,
869,0.97,6110.137,6117.544,Have them fill out paperwork and then at that time.,153,,
870,0.97,6117.544,6122.382,"Ultimately that eats away at the clock because you have landlords and attorney saying, wise the case that moving along?",153,,
871,0.97,6122.382,6147.908,"Meanwhile we have documentation requirements that we set at the time we had to get supported and a lot of times people don't come in with proof of income and any proof they have readily accessible, so we had to do shop calls at that point and said I don't know if we can actually under the funding represent them so we won't be able to bill it, but now we do this work we are funded for so it is stretching us and make us make difficult calls.",153,,
872,0.97,6147.908,6152.212,"To be Frank, we would say we have to figure it out later.",153,,
873,0.97,6152.212,6162.523,I'm not going to take a tenant who is desperate right there and needs help now and say I cannot help you because you didn't happen to know you needed to bring things that validate your income.,153,,
874,0.97,6162.523,6178.906,"That was creating a patchwork of unnecessary regulation, when a lot of people already met the threshold and 200% of the Federal poverty line and since last time when we had the discussion it is rare anyone exceeds that.",153,,
875,0.97,6178.906,6194.054,As soon as you start tacking on documentation or any type of means testing you can get really complicated and it means a lot of time lawyers are focused on someone's income when they are focused on the legal case and not focus on the outcome or anything else.,153,,
876,0.97,6194.054,6203.23,"We start giving this process with a thought, what are we Úsupposed to do with the time?",153,,
877,0.97,6203.23,6207.467,It's a hard thing to do in New York City and I definitely discourage it as much as possible here.,153,,
878,0.97,6207.467,6220.147,But I think it's an unnecessary barrier and people get evicted because of poverty . I don't think we need to add a layer to prove the poverty.,153,,
879,0.97,6220.147,6222.983,"Thank you, Edmund.",154,,
880,0.97,6222.983,6228.088,Extremely helpful.,154,,
881,0.97,6228.088,6238.165,That showed how it is not only unjust but not required because people who face poverty are the ones who are the most overwhelmingly likely to be evicted and helpful to make the connection.,154,,
882,0.97,6238.165,6241.702,"Councilmember Morales, not sure if you want to speak.",154,,
883,0.97,6241.702,6244.504,You lowered your hand.,154,,
884,0.97,6244.504,6250.978,"If other Councilmembers want to speak, let me know.",154,,
885,0.97,6250.978,6256.883,"But failing that, I will invite, Asha Venkataraman --",154,,
886,0.97,6256.883,6260.32,Councilmember Sawant?,155,,
887,0.97,6260.32,6278.905,"I am sorry and I am raising and lowering, but just want to thank Edmund for that perspective and I think it's really important as a lawyer moving this forward that we make sure it is baked into the process that people just have access.",155,,
888,0.97,6278.905,6291.318,That is the whole point is making sure people are getting access to representation and putting up yet another barrier is not going to be helpful in having the outcome we are looking for.,155,,
889,0.97,6291.318,6305.198,"I just want to thank you, Elin and Admin, for that perspective and to signal my support and interest in helping to cosponsor the legislation.",155,,
890,0.97,6305.198,6311.605,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Morales.",156,,
891,0.97,6311.605,6325.585,"We will list you as a cosponsor and I appreciate what you said and especially when you said the point is to give tenants access and what is the point of baking into the legislation barriers to the access because it doesn't make sense, so I appreciate the point of view.",156,,
892,0.97,6325.585,6360.787,"And before I call on Asha, something Councilmember Morales triggered my memory and I wonder if Alec can go over something that you already mentioned in your presentation but maybe it was missed, but I feel like some numbers you used to show when means testing was put into the Eviction moratorium in New York, recently, it had a huge impact, a negative and bad impact so can you go over that again?",156,,
893,0.97,6360.787,6365.826,Definitely.,157,,
894,0.97,6365.826,6386.246,"In January, the universal Eviction moratorium was extended until May 1ST with the caveat that March 1ST the universal aspect of bowl means tested version were provided for tenants to access the means tested version of the Eviction moratorium.",157,,
895,0.97,6386.246,6394.621,"However, in the three months the plan was in place only 9000 tenant statewide have applied for the program.",157,,
896,0.97,6394.621,6409.403,"Do you have an estimate as to how many tenants, are talking about hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands of tenants that would actually be eligible if there wasn't a barrier?",158,,
897,0.97,6409.403,6423.25,"I think you said earlier in the presentation that actually lawmakers, service providers, Renters and even landlords are all in agreement it's a very low number for the service.",158,,
898,0.97,6423.25,6441.067,"Of course it's hard to estimate with a patchwork of Eviction moratorium's exactly how many tenants this really affects, but I think it is illustrative and the numbers certainly well into the tens of thousands if not the hundreds of thousands.",159,,
899,0.97,6441.067,6465.992,"If you look at the rent relief program rolled out last summer, there were almost 100,000 applicants that applied for that and almost 60,000 of those applicants were denied access so that speaks a little bit to the needs of tenants and certainly without any substantial relief the situation isn't getting better as time progresses.",159,,
900,0.97,6465.992,6469.496,Thank you.,160,,
901,0.97,6469.496,6470.13,That definitely make sense.,160,,
902,0.97,6470.13,6478.271,"So without further delay, Asha if you can go over the memos please?",160,,
903,0.97,6478.271,6506.366,"I am Asha Venkataraman and as the Councilmember stated we are talking about 120007 which Codifies the Seattle municipal code and as mentioned, it is intended to be available to any tenants in Seattle that are facing Eviction.",161,,
904,0.97,6506.366,6508.168,Regardless of the tenant's income.,161,,
905,0.97,6508.168,6525.352,The bill itself lays out the details of what the right to Council looks like in the idea is for Council to be available as soon as people receive the complaint.,161,,
906,0.97,6525.352,6537.631,"So when the suit is filed by the landlord, there is a summons and a notice of the landlord that has to go to the tenant and once that is received, the right to Council is intended to kick in at that time.",161,,
907,0.97,6537.631,6551.177,"It is intended to last until the case is over, so until the court dismisses the case, until a judgment is entered or the complaint is withdrawn.",161,,
908,0.97,6551.177,6556.816,So the tenant is getting the full scope of legal representation as needed during the proceeding.,161,,
909,0.97,6556.816,6569.296,The bill also authorizes our Seattle Department of construction and inspections to enter into a contract for an organization to provide those services.,161,,
910,0.97,6569.296,6606.299,"Currently they contract with the housing project as well as the tenant law center, but the requirements in the bill lay out what it is that the Council is looking for in an organization that provides the services, so it is intended for an organization with experience supporting Renters and advocating for legal rights has where the proceedings are to taking place, and in this case the King County courthouse and can provide legal services in languages that are commonly spoken in Seattle or have access to translation services.",161,,
911,0.97,6606.299,6612.472,So those are intended to make the Practicaliies of obtaining Council a little bit easier.,161,,
912,0.97,6612.472,6644.904,There are also some provisions that speak to the obligations of them in terms of educating Renters in terms of their right to Council and the idea is for Sdci to update their notices to make clear that anyone facing Eviction has access to Council . They also speak to a requirement for landlords to update their notices to provide notice of the right to Council to the tenants and gives Sdci the opportunity to do Rulemaking to figure out what the language would look like.,161,,
913,0.97,6644.904,6659.319,"The last piece of that is once that Rulemaking is completed and landlords know what language they are supposed to put on the notice, if the language doesn't appear in the notice it would be a defense to Eviction.",161,,
914,0.97,6659.319,6686.346,"A couple of other things, the tenant is not required to accept Council . It just gives him the option of retaining Council . If they choose not to hire the Council provided by the city or go out to independently hire legal Council, the city is not responsible for paying those costs.",161,,
915,0.97,6686.346,6696.189,And the attorneys that the city is providing are not obligated to represent tenants that they are doing so would violate some Washington state court rules of confessional conduct.,161,,
916,0.97,6696.189,6706.266,"So just to make sure that the bill isn't requiring representation when there would be conflict, ethical conflict.",161,,
917,0.97,6706.266,6731.858,"This includes the provision as well, and Lastly and not in the codified session but asked the city to appropriate sufficient funds so the city can contract with an organization at the funding level that would cover all of the tenants that might need representation during an event and proceeding.",161,,
918,0.97,6731.858,6744.671,"At this point, if there are no questions about the provisions in the bill itself I can move into fiscal considerations but I will pause in case anyone has questions.",161,,
919,0.97,6744.671,6749.809,I have a quick question on the last point if it is appropriate now.,162,,
920,0.97,6749.809,6750.076,Okay.,163,,
921,0.97,6750.076,6768.528,"You mentioned in circumstances where there is a conflict, the core agency that has been contracted with might not be in a position to provide the representation.",164,,
922,0.97,6768.528,6775.335,It happens commonly in the criminal legal system where there might be a conflict with one of the defender agencies so one out side conflict Council is secured.,164,,
923,0.97,6775.335,6786.079,Is this a vision a process to do that or is that implied in the Rulemaking that Sdci would do that and their contracting?,164,,
924,0.97,6786.079,6801.961,"Would they be in a position to secure sufficient contracts for a conflict firm, or is that something we should envision in the core bill?",164,,
925,0.97,6801.961,6806.366,There isn't anything in the bill itself that speaks to what does happen in case there is a conflict of interest.,165,,
926,0.97,6806.366,6818.478,Sdci itself has the authority to contract with a variety of organizations but don't know they specifically thought through what a process might be for Council if there is a conflict.,165,,
927,0.97,6818.478,6829.322,"I would say that in this situation we currently have two Dividers that were contracted for, so the tenant law center and housing justice project.",165,,
928,0.97,6829.322,6849.943,"I would think if someone from housing justice project could not provide representation, if none of the attorneys were allowed to than someone from the tenant law center might be able to but that is something we can discuss further with Sdci to figure out what the more specific process might look like.",165,,
929,0.97,6849.943,6885.111,I think we should look into it because we contract with three of the constituent agencies or representation groups of Dpd who are part of our contract with the municipal court and certainly occasions where people are Conflicted out of all three of those agencies and we have to have coverage Council come in for whatever reason . I can see a scenario where both contracted groups could be contracted out so something to look into.,166,,
930,0.97,6885.111,6902.428,"My understanding is a related question, the right is going to attach to tenants, so we will be in a position where we have to be able to figure out a way to provide the representation consistent with the court rules around potential conflicts.",166,,
931,0.97,6902.428,6903.596,I think it is something to certainly prepare for.,166,,
932,0.97,6903.596,6908.534,"One more question, related to that.",166,,
933,0.97,6908.534,6918.912,At what point under the current legislation does this right go into effect?,166,,
934,0.97,6918.912,6934.394,"As it currently is drafted, it says legal representation shall be made available upon that person's request as soon as practical after a service of summons for unlawful Detainer suit.",167,,
935,0.97,6934.394,6954.681,"The language around that person's request is essentially a way for people to know one way or the other whether a tenant would need Council at all, and so otherwise there may not necessarily be a way for that to happen in the opposite direction.",167,,
936,0.97,6954.681,6967.86,My question was actually more like when are we going to be in a position where we are expected to be providing lawyers to people in Eviction proceedings?,168,,
937,0.97,6967.86,6969.128,Like one with this bill go into effect if we passed it?,168,,
938,0.97,6969.128,6970.229,I'm sorry.,168,,
939,0.97,6970.229,6972.632,Understood.,169,,
940,0.97,6972.632,6981.007,"This bill has the regular 30 day clause, so goes into effect 30 days from the signature of the Mayor.",169,,
941,0.97,6981.007,6990.316,"Ostensibly this would get voted on next Monday or the Monday after, and the Mayor would just sign it and goes into effect mid April.",169,,
942,0.97,6990.316,7007.066,"The reason I asked the question is I had not really thought about it until I read your compare and contrast of the state will and noticed the state Timeline, which would not go into effect for like a year or something like that.",170,,
943,0.97,7007.066,7024.984,"It made me think in terms of whether the Department--I have questions and Sdci and maybe you know the answer so I will last now, whether Sdci would be in a position to honor that right to Council on that turnaround, have they indicated they would?",170,,
944,0.97,7024.984,7051.244,"We have been having conversations about what the Timeline would look like and what my understanding is after the conversation was because we are already contracted with some providers and we are in the position where the moratorium is still in effect, right now we are able to provide Council to anyone facing an Eviction filing.",171,,
945,0.97,7051.244,7080.139,The uncertainty comes in as to what happens when the moratorium and the Sdci role in this would be to take the funding granted and add to an existing contract or create a new contract so they don't have very much to do with the actual--because they don't have much to do with the provision of legal services they are working on the contracting side.,171,,
946,0.97,7080.139,7087.046,There is not going to be very much time that it will take to wrap up because the contractor are already in place.,171,,
947,0.97,7087.046,7129.055,"The other thing that Sdci would be responsible for in terms of updating notices and education and doing the Rulemaking, hopefully my understanding is those are things that can be done in the short term and so those things can get done by the time this bill goes into effect and hopefully assuming there is some sort of extension to the Eviction moratorium, they would have the time built into ramp up already so we wouldn't need additional time to build in as the state bill references.",171,,
948,0.97,7129.055,7141.067,Am I to take that to mean the Department hasn't indicated there is any administer ability issues getting the operation in the Timeline that the legislation envisions?,172,,
949,0.97,7141.067,7141.667,That's my understanding.,173,,
950,0.97,7141.667,7142.401,Okay.,174,,
951,0.97,7142.401,7150.81,"Thank you, Asha, forgiving all the information.",175,,
952,0.97,7150.81,7155.114,I believe Councilmember Pedersen has a question.,175,,
953,0.97,7155.114,7181.541,"Before opening it up for the Councilmember, in terms of what Asha was Referencing, we don't know what will happen with the moratorium and organizing with Renters to ensure the moratoriums are renewed, but we don't want the moratoriums to and without Renters having Council so it is important that we do this.",175,,
954,0.97,7181.541,7188.614,"Having said that, Councilmember, please go ahead.",175,,
955,0.97,7188.614,7193.853,"Thank you, chair Sawant.",176,,
956,0.97,7193.853,7194.42,"Good morning, everybody.",176,,
957,0.97,7194.42,7204.73,I want to thank Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Lewis for bringing this forward.,176,,
958,0.97,7204.73,7209.168,"Also thank you for the panel of tenant advocates today, for your time and your experience sharing it with us.",176,,
959,0.97,7209.168,7212.505,Both here in Seattle and with other cities.,176,,
960,0.97,7212.505,7226.385,"While we don't have any landlords at the table today to get their perspective on how the practical impacts of this from their perspective, I did hear some of them call in and that was helpful.",176,,
961,0.97,7226.385,7237.897,And it sounds like the Seattle Department of construction and inspections has been consulted with their name in the bill to help administer this.,176,,
962,0.97,7237.897,7266.826,"Obviously we have the Seattle housing levity that awards money to Nonprofits to build and operate low-income housing through the city and we partner with the Seattle housing authority and King County housing authority and these questions are all for Asha, and I want to know if you had a chance to run it by the Seattle office of housing or the Seattle housing authority or King County housing authority?",176,,
963,0.97,7266.826,7273.866,We did the office of housing but did not receive any concerns from them about this particular piece of legislation.,177,,
964,0.97,7273.866,7281.741,"I haven't talked to the King County housing authority or to sha, so not sure if Councilmember Sawant, if your office had the conversation?",177,,
965,0.97,7281.741,7287.246,I have not.,177,,
966,0.97,7287.246,7316.042,"We have already talked a lot about the concept of means testing, of whether something like this should be targeted to those who are low income, and I have heard the arguments against that, so I appreciate that being fleshed out and not sure I am totally on board with that but I do appreciate it.",178,,
967,0.97,7316.042,7325.384,"So I understand the Council bill better, in addition to there not being means testing, looks like it's not targeted to nonpayment of rent.",178,,
968,0.97,7325.384,7330.523,But for a legend violation of the lease in addition to potential nonpayment of rent.,178,,
969,0.97,7330.523,7333.893,"Is that true, Asha?",178,,
970,0.97,7333.893,7339.098,That's correct.,179,,
971,0.97,7339.098,7341.767,Okay.,180,,
972,0.97,7341.767,7360.086,"Would be interested, if we are able to get anymore back from the office of housing or housing authority whether there is concern about this not applying to other issues of the lease agreement between the tenant and the landlord and in some cases many Nonprofits operating housing throughout the city.",180,,
973,0.97,7360.086,7369.328,I was doing some research as quickly as I could before today's meeting on some other interventions that we have.,180,,
974,0.97,7369.328,7381.04,"There are different ways we are trying to support tenants in need, and was reminded of the different budget actions we took a few months ago.",180,,
975,0.97,7381.04,7404.764,"Under Councilmember Sawant's leadership to increase the budget, there was an increase of $460,000 for Eviction legal defense and another $145,000 increase from Councilmember Strauss adding $500,000 so it looks like we have more than doubled the financial support.",180,,
976,0.97,7404.764,7415.574,The reason I mention that is I am interested in trying to be helpful through the budget process to provide the funding for those who need it.,180,,
977,0.97,7415.574,7436.695,"Where is this is a regulatory change, so there are different ways to help and I am more interested in the budgetary ads, and I'm glad we added money in the past and hope we can consider that as we see what happens going forward.",180,,
978,0.97,7436.695,7442.935,We also banned Evictions during the coldest winter months thanks to Councilmember Sawant's leadership.,180,,
979,0.97,7442.935,7460.686,"We banned it during the Covid pandemic and adopted the President's program to establish back when following Covid so I'm interested in the state Senate bill 5160, and as I understand it it is moving forward.",180,,
980,0.97,7460.686,7466.625,The legislative session will be over soon and interested to see what the state legislators come up with.,180,,
981,0.97,7466.625,7472.064,I know they are considering several elements that would be useful.,180,,
982,0.97,7472.064,7479.138,I want to signal I do have concerns about the bill before us in its present form.,180,,
983,0.97,7479.138,7490.249,"I am interested in looking at the budget situation, interested in seeing what the state legislature does and want to get those thoughts out there as we consider this.",180,,
984,0.97,7490.249,7495.287,Thank you.,180,,
985,0.97,7495.287,7503.062,"If it would be helpful, I can talk a little more about the budgetary piece of it and what we are looking at as well as some of the elements in the state bill.",181,,
986,0.97,7503.062,7508.133,"Go ahead, Asha.",182,,
987,0.97,7508.133,7533.492,"Currently in terms of what we are looking at with funding, for 2021, the whole budget for tenant services, so not just the budget for legal but the entire budget is close to $1.7 million.",183,,
988,0.97,7533.492,7538.964,What we actually allocate to pieces around legal Eviction defense is about one-third of that and that has been the case for the past two years at least.,183,,
989,0.97,7538.964,7548.574,Those funds are split between the housing justice project and the tenant law center.,183,,
990,0.97,7548.574,7565.891,"The specifics of legal representation are one of the things that gets funded, so at the moment as Referenced in the memo, the housing justice project gets $218,000 of about the $560,000 allocated to just the legal and Eviction events piece.",183,,
991,0.97,7565.891,7587.613,"So working from the estimate that it would take $750,000 to be able to provide legal Council in a typical year and not necessarily in a moratorium or pandemic year, but if we look at 1200 Evictions that are filed a year in Seattle, we look at that $750,000 number.",183,,
992,0.97,7587.613,7605.097,"Currently given the $218,000 and given the uncertainty around when the moratorium will be lifted, it is possible that at some point during this year which as I mentioned we don't know yet, more funding will be needed for allocation to legal and Eviction defense.",183,,
993,0.97,7605.097,7614.34,There are still some funds that Sdci has not yet awarded out of the $1.7 million that could go towards funding legal Eviction defense piece.,183,,
994,0.97,7614.34,7629.455,"In future years to fund it long- term, with the $750,000 number there are couple of ways to deal with funding in that scenario.",183,,
995,0.97,7629.455,7645.137,"Assuming the assumption that no additional funds would be added, for the 2022 budget, there would need to be reallocation of how the current tenant services budget is granted.",183,,
996,0.97,7645.137,7651.21,That would mean Reshuffling some of the current ways in which those funds or how Sdci allocates the funds.,183,,
997,0.97,7651.21,7667.226,"If there are funds added during this year's budget for 2022 an ongoing, the reallocation may not necessarily be needed but depends how much additional funding ends up being added to the budget for 2022.",183,,
998,0.97,7667.226,7701.56,"That could be--there is a gap of about four $40,000 between what would be awarded for the housing justice project assuming additional funds get added this year and the $750,000 number, so ballpark to keep the tenant services budget hole, we need between $300,000 and $500,000 Additionally in this year's budget for the program to move ongoing.",183,,
999,0.97,7701.56,7712.671,The last piece of that which was mentioned earlier during the panel based on the 1200 filings we are currently seeing.,183,,
1000,0.97,7712.671,7733.992,"It's entirely possible that as Mre and more people learn about the right to legal Council, and are educated about the fact that they can access an attorney, that people who have been leaving before the filings actually happened would wait until there was a filing and then want to have access to legal Council.",183,,
1001,0.97,7733.992,7748.841,"It's possible the numbers would increase but until the education and outreach is out there and we know how the program is functioning it's not clear that the $750,000 will be sufficient for the long-term.",183,,
1002,0.97,7748.841,7760.586,Some of this will be waiting to see how the program goes as it is implemented and monitoring to see if there are increases or decreases in Eviction filings that affect that number.,183,,
1003,0.97,7760.586,7766.892,Thank you.,184,,
1004,0.97,7766.892,7771.597,I was going to pause for questions before moving to anything else.,185,,
1005,0.97,7771.597,7774.466,I don't see any.,186,,
1006,0.97,7774.466,7780.606,"I have a quick question, Madam chair.",187,,
1007,0.97,7780.606,7784.71,"I appreciate you going over those costs, Asha.",188,,
1008,0.97,7784.71,7795.02,Good reporting yesterday by S.E.C.,188,,
1009,0.97,7795.02,7815.073,Indicating other costs in other cities and how we might expect to see it but as a too early to tell her would you be prepared to provide an opinion our analysis on this and whether we would expect those costs to be potential cost increases and to be permanent or temporary based on the unique impacts of the pandemic?,188,,
1010,0.97,7815.073,7818.377,It's tough to say.,189,,
1011,0.97,7818.377,7830.355,"I think it's primarily because the landscape changes so quickly, depending on what bills get past out of the state Legislature this year.",189,,
1012,0.97,7830.355,7831.723,Also as well as what legislation comes out of the city.,189,,
1013,0.97,7831.723,7845.637,It is possible that the differences made to the just cause Eviction pieces could have some impact on Eviction filings.,189,,
1014,0.97,7845.637,7858.15,It's possible that knowing that landlords know that tenants have a right to Council and might be more interested in mediation before making an Eviction filing.,189,,
1015,0.97,7858.15,7876.535,"There are a lot of factors that go into figuring out whether filings will increase or decrease, but the pandemic and the associated moratorium I think you get complicated for us to have any real idea in the long-term about what will happen.",189,,
1016,0.97,7876.535,7897.789,"Do we know as one last question in the event that some kind of means testing regime were attached to this, would that carry additional unanticipated cost?",190,,
1017,0.97,7897.789,7910.936,"It hadn't occurred to me until today to administer something like that, there would probably need to be additional contracted service and interested if that can be quantified and if you don't have the answer now, maybe later, just curious about that.",190,,
1018,0.97,7910.936,7912.271,I would be happy to follow up on that piece.,191,,
1019,0.97,7912.271,7922.547,I think some of it depends on whether it is something we want Sdci to be responsible so make cost of having FTE in any I.T.,191,,
1020,0.97,7922.547,7935.56,"Costs that would be required in terms of setting up a new program, or we would want to contract out to someone who could do the Vetting or increase contract amounts to our current contractors to do that work.",191,,
1021,0.97,7935.56,7939.498,So that is definitely something I can check about and see if we can get numbers on.,191,,
1022,0.97,7939.498,7946.772,So you can confirm now there would likely be costs associated with it but unclear what the costs are?,192,,
1023,0.97,7946.772,7955.48,That is my current understanding.,193,,
1024,0.97,7955.48,7956.014,Yes.,193,,
1025,0.97,7956.014,7968.026,"At the very least, Sdci has the capacity to stand up a new program that would cover all of the pieces around what it would take to administer a means test without additional funding or Ftes.",193,,
1026,0.97,7968.026,7990.015,"As a last related question and I'm sorry, Councilmember Sawant but you will probably like this question, we saw in Kevin Schofield's reporting yesterday that San Francisco only had 6% of people that weren't indigent that took advantage of the no means tested system.",194,,
1027,0.97,7990.015,8003.729,"Another thing that would be interesting when you look at Quantifying the cost of what it would be to administer is, with the city end up spending more on means testing that we save in providing legal Council to people who would fall outside of it?",194,,
1028,0.97,8003.729,8012.771,That would be an interesting analysis because it seems like from the San Francisco experience it might almost be the case.,194,,
1029,0.97,8012.771,8020.979,You certainly want to see that before we make assumptions that we would save taxpayer money by imposing a means testing regime.,194,,
1030,0.97,8020.979,8028.286,But I want to confirm that don't want to assume that.,194,,
1031,0.97,8028.286,8030.021,The Statistics seem to indicate that might be the case so I am curious.,194,,
1032,0.97,8030.021,8030.389,Absolutely.,195,,
1033,0.97,8030.389,8032.057,Happy to follow up on that piece when I have the chance to talk to Sdci.,195,,
1034,0.97,8032.057,8060.018,"And I would add from overall economic evidence and I don't have an exact answer to your question, Councilmember Lewis, as far as it is related to right to Council but I can tell you that the overwhelming economic evidence shows a very basic fact that yes, it will always cost public revenues to carry out a means test and no question about it.",196,,
1035,0.97,8060.018,8064.055,Whether on balance it cost more or less in the service is a different question.,196,,
1036,0.97,8064.055,8078.437,But there is no doubt that it actually costs resources in order to carry out a means test and the question is what does it actually give in return and that is what is most important as far as questions.,196,,
1037,0.97,8078.437,8084.076,Does it allow people who need the service to access it or does it create barriers?,196,,
1038,0.97,8084.076,8100.459,I promise you right to Council is not the first kind of public assistance with this question came up.,196,,
1039,0.97,8100.459,8117.943,The conservative economists and politicians have made arguments in favor of means testing for decades and for decades the evidence shows that actually a smaller and sometimes very small proportion of people who are eligible for the service actually end up getting it because it SETS up barriers of various kinds.,196,,
1040,0.97,8117.943,8124.316,And I appreciate Edmund and Elin going over all of those barriers that were put in place.,196,,
1041,0.97,8124.316,8150.408,"I would say the biggest cost of putting in means testing is not even the dollar amount, but actually what happens to people's lives when the lives get ravaged because they are not able to access and as legislators we have to put the biggest value on what happens to people's lives.",196,,
1042,0.97,8150.408,8161.887,"A very thorough discussion and a lot of points, and Asha do you want to go over the state bill and I have some points on that as well and I want to be mindful of the time.",196,,
1043,0.97,8161.887,8179.137,We are already past two hours and I don't want to lose committee members because we want to vote on the legislation so I will have you talk about the state pole and then I will add some points and hopefully we can move to a vote.,196,,
1044,0.97,8179.137,8179.404,Go ahead.,196,,
1045,0.97,8179.404,8185.61,I can speak to it very briefly in terms of the differences between what is in the state bill and what we are discussing currently.,197,,
1046,0.97,8185.61,8203.828,"In terms of eligibility, the state bill does limit access to indigent tenants which they define as receiving a variety of public assistance benefits are being at 200% of the Federal poverty level.",197,,
1047,0.97,8203.828,8222.347,"The other big difference--I'm sorry, I'm looking at my comparison, the other big difference is that as Councilmember Lewis mentioned, it would go into effect until effective date of the bill.",197,,
1048,0.97,8222.347,8240.999,Asks the office of civil legal aid which is the office that would administer the contracts to submit an implementation plan within 90 days of when the bill was passed and has some Prioritization to counties that have the most Evictions.,197,,
1049,0.97,8240.999,8250.775,"And Lastly, it is specific that the court must appoint an attorney to an indigent tenant at any show cause hearing or scheduled trial so more detail about when exactly that attorney would be appointed.",197,,
1050,0.97,8250.775,8264.022,In the last part is legislation itself updating the 14 day pay or vacate notice as well as the summons form to include language around right to Council.,197,,
1051,0.97,8264.022,8266.925,Those are the main points of that bill.,198,,
1052,0.97,8266.925,8269.127,"Thank you, Asha.",199,,
1053,0.97,8269.127,8298.356,"And to add to what you said, I would also say that the state bill, just to clarify, the state tenant bill has not passed either the Chamber at that point and it might get watered down and we don't know but would not be surprising but currently includes stringent means testing capped at 200%.",199,,
1054,0.97,8298.356,8314.539,And as you have noted the property line will take effect for year and maybe longer but the most important point is it's not clear if this will pass the Senate and would need to go to the house on a tight Timeline of many bills with broad support end up dying in a typical year.,199,,
1055,0.97,8314.539,8343.601,"That is what we see, so while of course I very much hope that this will pass, we simply cannot count on it and in fact the state continues to have shockingly Anti-Rental laws on the books like the statewide Ben Benardrick control and even other laws and justice project attorneys have resented in past years how other states are much better.",199,,
1056,0.97,8343.601,8381.773,"What we have seen on the other hand is when we pass progressive legislation in Seattle it helps momentum to also pass it citywide we sought with the $15 minimum wage and also see it from Renters rights and I will also stress and maybe you already said this, but the Senate bill and the city council legislation will not be contradictory or mutually exclusive many Renters rights are asserted at the state and local level and it's quite important because it allows Renters to appeal to the city or state to have the rights of Council and nothing bad that comes out of it are good things coming out of it depending who you represent.",199,,
1057,0.97,8381.773,8403.595,"If you represent the most vulnerable good things can come out of it and I want to add I forgot to mention in terms of Councilmember Lewis and his question, a very good question about does it actually have an impact on the number of Eviction filings itself if tenants have representation guaranteed by law?",199,,
1058,0.97,8403.595,8419.244,I think that is very important to note and I believe John Pollick who presented at the last Midi for the national coalition for right to Council said in New York City Eviction filings have dropped by 30% including a 20% drop in 2019 alone.,199,,
1059,0.97,8419.244,8429.587,So it shows how much Evictions have to do with the power dynamic with corporate landlords and ordinary people who are Renters.,199,,
1060,0.97,8429.587,8445.837,"So when landlords know that what they are going to face in the court is not a really vulnerable tenant who was lost in the process because the courts are not on their side, but instead a trained attorney, then it actually is a deterrent to Eviction filings itself.",199,,
1061,0.97,8445.837,8455.213,"I think all of these factors are going to play a role in what the numbers, to be at the very end.",199,,
1062,0.97,8455.213,8457.282,I don't believe you can actually see that until this law goes into effect.,199,,
1063,0.97,8457.282,8471.729,I think the slot needs to be put in place and see how much of a good impact it's having but no doubt in my mind having seen what's happening in New York City that it will have a very good impact.,199,,
1064,0.97,8471.729,8484.742,"How much of an impact, we can see what happens when it's in place but very clear it will be extremely positive.",199,,
1065,0.97,8484.742,8501.359,"Unless there are burning questions, I don't want to lose Councilmembers and I really appreciate your time, not only Councilmembers but Presenters and Asha, I feel ready to move this to a vote.",199,,
1066,0.97,8501.359,8512.837,Just wait a few seconds before I move just in case there are burning questions.,199,,
1067,0.97,8512.837,8526.084,"Seeing none, I will go ahead and move Council bill 120-0074 a vote.",199,,
1068,0.97,8526.084,8529.487,Do I have a second?,199,,
1069,0.97,8529.487,8531.256,Second.,200,,
1070,0.97,8531.256,8539.297,Thank you.,201,,
1071,0.97,8539.297,8539.998,Were you saying something?,202,,
1072,0.97,8539.998,8540.598,I was trying to second.,203,,
1073,0.97,8540.598,8541.699,Work . Mes my microphone does n't,203,,
1074,0.97,8541.699,8544.235,Thank you.,204,,
1075,0.97,8544.235,8547.438,So the bill is being moved and Seconded.,204,,
1076,0.97,8547.438,8554.012,Are there any additional comments?,204,,
1077,0.97,8554.012,8554.546,Councilmember Sawant?,205,,
1078,0.97,8554.546,8557.515,Go ahead.,206,,
1079,0.97,8557.515,8563.021,Briefly I appreciate the discussion today.,206,,
1080,0.97,8563.021,8581.94,"I particularly requested a lot of information from central staff and additional analysis, so considering I do support the core tenets of the legislation and cosponsored it, I'm willing to voted out of Committee in reliance that we probably know what the answers to a lot of the questions will be.",206,,
1081,0.97,8581.94,8599.257,I want to signal that I feel more comfortable on the final passage of this at full council having got those answers back from central staff but with those reservations I will vote for it today.,206,,
1082,0.97,8599.257,8599.657,Thank you.,207,,
1083,0.97,8599.657,8602.961,Any other comments?,207,,
1084,0.97,8602.961,8608.433,Not seeing any hands on zoom.,207,,
1085,0.97,8608.433,8618.776,"Seeing no other comments, I will ask the clerk to call for the vote.",207,,
1086,0.97,8618.776,8620.611,Councilmember Sawant?,208,,
1087,0.97,8620.611,8623.648,Yes.,209,,
1088,0.97,8623.648,8624.449,Councilmember Morales?,210,,
1089,0.97,8624.449,8625.817,Yes.,211,,
1090,0.97,8625.817,8630.455,Councilmember Lewis?,212,,
1091,0.97,8630.455,8631.189,Yes.,213,,
1092,0.97,8631.189,8635.193,Councilmember Pedersen?,214,,
1093,0.97,8635.193,8636.461,No.,215,,
1094,0.97,8636.461,8638.629,And Councilmember Juarez is not present.,216,,
1095,0.97,8638.629,8639.53,That is three in favor and one Oposed.,216,,
1096,0.97,8639.53,8644.302,"Thank you, Councilmembers and thank you, Ted.",217,,
1097,0.97,8644.302,8668.493,"And in terms of what Councilmember Lewis said before I close this agenda item, my understanding is the questions you asked, Councilmember Lewis, are questions that will have answers once the laws in effect in how we see how much it is deterring landlords from filing Evictions and how much are seeking assistance and so on.",217,,
1098,0.97,8668.493,8686.844,I just want to be clear that some of the questions I think Asha can find answers to and some are just the nature of Statistics and we have to see the change in order to see if it makes sense so I just wanted to clarify that.,217,,
1099,0.97,8686.844,8695.887,I think some of the more immediate ones are around Quantifying some of the fiscal implications for the city which I think we can figure out.,218,,
1100,0.97,8695.887,8707.165,But certainly some of them are what would be effective this legislation would be on the rental market and it is true that we won't really know what Intel it's an effect.,218,,
1101,0.97,8707.165,8714.872,"In terms of the impact on city finances, that stuff we should be able to figure out.",218,,
1102,0.97,8714.872,8720.478,And departmental capacity and whatever else.,218,,
1103,0.97,8720.478,8742.3,But also I want to clarify and to reiterate what Asha said and I know you talked about departmental capacity but it is the attorneys with organizations like housing justice providing the service and not the Department of construction providing the service so the bulk of the time and resources is not focused on the city departments.,219,,
1104,0.97,8742.3,8746.504,I just wanted to clarify that as well.,219,,
1105,0.97,8746.504,8759.217,We will absolutely work with Asha and central staff as a whole to make sure whatever is needed is compiled.,219,,
1106,0.97,8759.217,8779.67,"And I also want to say when we talk about uncertainties, of course it is very clear and honestly stated in the fiscal note that there is an attorney but want to make clear that it is not in all kinds of directions and not we are going to find out it is actually hurting Renters.",219,,
1107,0.97,8779.67,8780.138,That's not the case.,219,,
1108,0.97,8780.138,8802.827,"It's only a question of how much of a magnitude of an effect it has on Renters, and I think the indication from other cities are very strong, like $15 an hour and not the first and winter Evictions we are not the first to do it and a good thing we have data to go by.",219,,
1109,0.97,8802.827,8811.669,So all of that should be extremely helpful for us to make sure that we have responses to the questions that have come up.,219,,
1110,0.97,8811.669,8840.598,"Having said that, and in the interest of time, I think Councilmembers for engaging on that legislation and especially a very big thank you and gratitude to all of our Presenters and panelists including Asha and our community members and our Renters rights advocates and Renter rights services providers.",219,,
1111,0.97,8840.598,8849.073,Thank you for all the information and guidance you have provided not just today but throughout the years of ever since we started researching right to Council.,219,,
1112,0.97,8849.073,8853.844,I appreciate that.,219,,
1113,0.97,8853.844,8880.004,"I will move quickly to the next agenda item and the final items are items 3 to 6 which are Reappointments to the Seattle Renters commissions and because they are Reappointments rather than new appointments, it is not customary to have them appear in committee but I will have them read and record for now.",219,,
1114,0.97,8880.004,8928.552,"The appointment 01814 reappointment of Dinah Braccio and I apologize for my dog who was howling . Reappointing for a firm of February 28, 2023 and appointment 01815 four Calvin Jones a member of Seattle Renters Commission for a term of February 28, 22 and reappointment 01816 reappointment of Max Scotty Ray Mcgregor is a member of Seattle Renters Commission for a term of February 28, 22, appointment 01817 reappointment of Regina Owens as a member of Seattle Renters Commission for a term to February 28, 2023.",219,,
1115,0.97,8928.552,8953.944,So Dinah Braccio is an Organizer for the tenants Union and Jones got involved in the submission is a get engaged in Pointy period is a leader in the Lgbtq committee and Gina Owens is with the Washington action network and all four have played an excellent role on the Renters Commission and Councilmembers may know them as well through their work in the community.,219,,
1116,0.97,8953.944,8964.789,I will quickly open it up for any questions or comments that Councilmembers have.,219,,
1117,0.97,8964.789,8968.292,Seeing none.,220,,
1118,0.97,8968.292,8977.601,I will go ahead and if there is no opposition I will go ahead and move all four appointments as a single vote.,220,,
1119,0.97,8977.601,8985.509,"I move appointment 01814, 15, 16, and 17.",220,,
1120,0.97,8985.509,8987.845,Second.,221,,
1121,0.97,8987.845,8990.648,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",222,,
1122,0.97,8990.648,8992.35,"Ted, can you call the roll?",222,,
1123,0.97,8992.35,8993.551,Councilmember Sawant?,223,,
1124,0.97,8993.551,8996.253,Yes.,224,,

1133,0.97,9012.87,9024.849,The appointments and the Reappointments and the legislation will move forward to full Council and the appointments will move on Monday.,232,,
1134,0.97,9024.849,9043.768,My hope is the legislation will also move this coming Monday and we will be in touch with all committee members and we will be in touch with community members and the panelists to make sure everyone is well informed about when the final vote will be on the right to Council legislation.,232,,
1135,0.97,9043.768,9050.341,I really appreciate Councilmembers staying for longer committee than usual.,232,,
