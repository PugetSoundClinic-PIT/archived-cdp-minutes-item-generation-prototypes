355,0.97,2301.999,2306.971,"Here in Seattle, do you think putting more money into this will fix anything?",74,,
356,0.97,2306.971,2311.509,We need to rethink our justice system and we need to rethink how we can treat mental health.,74,,
357,0.97,2311.509,2315.313,We benefited significantly in eliminating depression and helping.,74,,
358,0.97,2315.313,2325.523,"And right now with the eyes of the city in the state, I'm a criminal for using this therapy and overcoming my weaknesses.",74,,
359,0.97,2325.523,2333.297,Something that has benefited my life so greatly could land me in jail where I would lose my job and probably not be able to financially recover.,74,,
360,0.97,2333.297,2340.271,"Instead of putting more money into a field campaign and drug enforcement, we need to strengthen the community and use the money for mental health Teatment that works.",74,,

370,0.97,2359.356,2366.897,I live in district 7. I'm calling for the Council to pass the original version.,78,,
371,0.97,2366.897,2380.077,The court monitor has told you that a funding cut may impact with the consent decree but SPD is choosing to use this as hostage for a specific chunk of funding.,78,,
372,0.97,2380.077,2388.886,The choice demonstrates why we should cut funding in the first place and that is the police treatment doesn't care about the residents of Seattle.,78,,
373,0.97,2388.886,2401.465,They demonstrated an difference in how they handled the protests and how they handled gassing residential neighborhoods and people in their homes and how it handles wellness checks and how would rather rest protesters for Chock rather than go after someone who put a 2-year-old in the hospital.,78,,
374,0.97,2401.465,2402.6,Still at large by the way.,78,,
375,0.97,2402.6,2405.002,Officers cannot even wear mastering the pandemic because I don't feel like it.,78,,
376,0.97,2405.002,2424.455,"A couple weeks ago, SPD had to Backtrack . and when they were asked for comment, the Department's spokesperson had a lot more to say about the person that leaked details to the Council than the content of the organization.",78,,

378,0.97,2424.889,2431.028,The next Speaker is Julia Buck.,79,,

383,0.97,2440.805,2464.528,I'm a resident of district six and a member of the Seattle CFA and I'm calling to encourage the Council to send the 8.4 million from SPD and send it back to the Participatory budgeting process including the 5 Million-Dollar proviso.,80,,
384,0.97,2464.528,2474.672,The consent decree was designed to bring SPD into compliance.,80,,
385,0.97,2474.672,2477.775,The consent decree has not been complied with for eight years.,80,,
386,0.97,2477.775,2482.48,We have attempted to follow the course of action laid out.,80,,
387,0.97,2482.48,2493.123,But the consent decree does allow us to provide flexibility to find solutions for the community.,80,,
388,0.97,2493.123,2503.0,I would encourage counsel to divest from SPD the crisis intervention training has not worked.,80,,
389,0.97,2503.0,2504.201,Thank you so much.,81,,
390,0.97,2504.201,2509.84,The next Speaker is Lynn judge.,81,,

395,0.97,2527.291,2529.994,I usually speak for 350 Seattle.,82,,
396,0.97,2529.994,2532.029,350 Seattle stands in solidarity with demands to defend Seattle police.,82,,
397,0.97,2532.029,2547.011,I'm here today as an elder in district 5. asking for increased police presence downtown and elsewhere is problematic when so many suffer so much at the hands of SPD.,82,,
398,0.97,2547.011,2550.714,We Elders can trust and our community to keep an eye out for us.,82,,
399,0.97,2550.714,2552.449,"Yesterday, I took a bad fall from my bike.",82,,
400,0.97,2552.449,2559.056,It wasn't the first time and a helpful citizen rushed to see if I was okay.,82,,
401,0.97,2559.056,2571.368,My only thought lying on the ground was that I hope no one would call 911 because he was a black man and the last thing I wanted was for the police to come and him to suffer trauma or even harm.,82,,
402,0.97,2571.368,2583.447,"In my 30 years in Seattle, I have witnessed countless instances of SPD harm caused to people of color, homeless neighbors, neighbors and mental health crises and peaceful protesters.",82,,
403,0.97,2583.447,2589.787,To safety for Elders and others will never come from the hands of SPD.,82,,

409,0.97,2619.016,2623.22,Spd funding has nothing to do with the consent decree.,84,,
410,0.97,2623.22,2627.691,Seattle is still under the decree despite the SPD budget growing over 150 million since Seattle entered it.,84,,
411,0.97,2627.691,2642.306,The decree came from the apartment of justice finding SPD engages in a pattern or practice of using unnecessary or excessive force in violation of the Constitution.,84,,
412,0.97,2642.306,2649.213,The goal of the decree is to ensure SPD's use of force is consistent with requirements of the U.S. Constitution.,84,,
413,0.97,2649.213,2651.148,The consent decree does not require any staffing or funding levels.,84,,
414,0.97,2651.148,2656.687,It just lays out its course of action.,84,,
415,0.97,2656.687,2665.929,Tsunami a goal and leaving with appropriate ability to find solutions suitable for the community.,85,,
416,0.97,2665.929,2674.638,The next Speaker is Aiden Carol followed by KATY Kettering.,86,,

419,0.97,2693.557,2709.106,"In this case, SPD is actively defining what you told them and daring you to follow through on what you said.",87,,
420,0.97,2709.106,2723.954,"It is as if you went to a restaurant with a friend and the friend said, ""I only have $20 in cash"" and you say, ""I'm sorry.",87,,
421,0.97,2723.954,2738.335,"I don't have the (Indiscernible) to pay for anything ."" but they order shaken say, can you please pay for it?",87,,

428,0.97,2777.04,2781.378,We cannot permit SPD to spend more on overtime then allowed in the budget.,89,,
429,0.97,2781.378,2789.92,"If black lives matter to you, you would be Defunding SPD, and increasing the budget and overtime spending has been cited as a public safety issue.",89,,
430,0.97,2789.92,2798.595,"In 12 days, the SP overtime cost totaled $6.3 million and there were 15,000 complains of misconduct and a joint lawsuit.",89,,
431,0.97,2798.595,2800.998,How are you holding SPD accountable for misconduct by the recent proposal?,89,,
432,0.97,2800.998,2806.103,Why are you giving SPD this check as it relates to overtime?,89,,
433,0.97,2806.103,2818.048,It is clear by allowing SPD to it does keep the majority of the overtime spending that you are not holding people accountable to the violence and police accountable to the human rights violation and you are Okaying SPD unleashing hell on protesters.,89,,
434,0.97,2818.048,2825.088,But you really do not care about --,89,,
435,0.97,2825.088,2830.527,Thank you.,90,,

447,0.97,2894.958,2899.162,Thank you so much.,96,,
448,0.97,2899.162,2901.131,So just a little bit of background.,96,,
449,0.97,2901.131,2904.801,I want to thank everyone that called in this morning.,96,,
450,0.97,2904.801,2922.486,Especially the parking enforcement officers that consistently push the Council along with other members of the community that we have heard from advocating on behalf of the parking enforcement officers workforce driven vision for Reimagining public safety.,96,,
451,0.97,2922.486,2933.23,And allowing civilian iced workforce to take a greater role.,96,,
452,0.97,2933.23,2934.531,A workforce that is 60% by Pok.,96,,
453,0.97,2934.531,2936.199,The bill before us will do two things.,96,,
454,0.97,2936.199,2948.912,It would transfer 911 call center positions and the PEO's from the police Department to the community safety and communication center.,96,,
455,0.97,2948.912,2957.421,"In the budget, we unanimously passed ordinance 126233.",96,,
456,0.97,2957.421,2964.528,That was the ordinance that establish the new community safety and medication center and included both 911 dispatch and PEO's.,96,,
457,0.97,2964.528,2983.48,The creation of the community safety communication center is intended to help Reframe how the city provides for community safety in response to the Council interest and explores expanded duties for the PEO's.,96,,
458,0.97,2983.48,2998.495,"With that, I will hand it over to central staff to walk us through other elements of the bill.",96,,
459,0.97,2998.495,3005.502,And I will may be pepper you with some questions or additional background.,96,,
460,0.97,3005.502,3006.503,"Lisa, can you please introduce yourself.",96,,
461,0.97,3006.503,3007.204,Thank you Madam chair.,97,,
462,0.97,3007.204,3008.005,"Lise Kaye, central staff.",97,,
463,0.97,3008.005,3020.55,I will go ahead and share my screen to show the Council bill here in case people have specific questions about the text specifically.,97,,
464,0.97,3020.55,3028.025,"Councilmember, I think you gave a good overview of what the bill would do.",97,,
465,0.97,3028.025,3045.809,"I would emphasize again that this bill is consistent with ordinance 126233 which Council passed last fall and created this new center and with the adopted 2021 budget which anticipated and today's legislation but transfers these positions by June 1ST, 2021.",97,,
466,0.97,3045.809,3058.655,I would note that the executive has appointed an interim director to the center and expects to request additional administrative support in the 2022 budget.,97,,
467,0.97,3058.655,3062.059,I will just advance the bill to show you a couple of the pertinent sections.,97,,
468,0.97,3062.059,3063.627,This is on page 6 of the agenda packet.,97,,
469,0.97,3063.627,3068.532,I would also note that my staff report is on page 50 of your agenda materials.,97,,
470,0.97,3068.532,3084.581,"Looking at the bill itself, section one makes a technical change which adds ""a purpose statement to the budget summary level that authorizes expenditures that align with the 911 and PEO functions click will.",97,,
471,0.97,3084.581,3094.057,It is a book keeping function that needs to be in place to spend the money.,97,,
472,0.97,3094.057,3096.092,Section two is about 39 pages of transferring of the positions.,97,,
473,0.97,3096.092,3108.405,So there are 149 call center positions and 120 positions from the parking enforcement officers unit.,97,,
474,0.97,3108.405,3122.686,Section three is a ratify and confirm clause that would allow the executives to take action consistent with legislation prior to its effective date which will be after the June 1ST 2021 deadline in the budget proviso.,97,,
475,0.97,3122.686,3130.227,"As you will see in section four, the bill is effective 30 days after the Mayor's approval.",97,,
476,0.97,3130.36,3132.329,"That basically COMPLETES my report, Madam chair.",97,,
477,0.97,3132.329,3137.801,Can you talk a little bit about the importance of the June 4TH date?,98,,
478,0.97,3137.801,3152.249,The June 1ST deadline was anticipated because--let me start by with a little bit of history when the Mayor originally proposed creating a new center.,99,,
479,0.97,3152.249,3160.957,She had a June 1ST--or January 1ST start date which was found to not be feasible.,99,,
480,0.97,3160.957,3168.265,"When you are moving the 911 center, you need to have a particular numbered designation that the Federal Government provides.",99,,
481,0.97,3168.265,3171.067,It takes a long time to get the paperwork in place.,99,,
482,0.97,3171.067,3184.748,So ordinance 126233 provided the time and so that the 911 transfer could start 30 days after that number was obtained.,99,,
483,0.97,3184.748,3191.888,But the June 1ST date would be a transfer for the parking enforcement officers just to give time to get everything organized.,99,,
484,0.97,3191.888,3196.893,Thank you.,100,,
485,0.97,3196.893,3212.309,And so what was the change that the Council made when we acted during the budget process and changed it to June 1ST from what the (Indiscernible) proposed with January because it was not determined to be feasible.,100,,
486,0.97,3212.309,3226.723,"We also at that time change the Mayor's proposal from what was being called the Seattle emergency communication center because at that point, it was envisioned only to house 911.",100,,
487,0.97,3226.723,3252.415,And we changed the name from the narrowly focused Seattle emergency communication center to the community safety communication center to incorporate the Council sort of broader version of part of the Reimagining public safety.,100,,
488,0.97,3252.415,3253.25,"And, let's see here.",100,,
489,0.97,3253.25,3259.422,I'm looking to see if there are any important points that we need to make.,100,,
490,0.97,3259.422,3266.162,Points that have not already been made by so many of the Úfolks who have joined us today to speak.,100,,
491,0.97,3266.162,3280.844,And I'm also looking to see if any of my colleagues have any questions . and I'm not seeing any raised hands here.,100,,
492,0.97,3280.844,3281.344,Councilmember Gonzales?,100,,
493,0.97,3281.344,3291.588,Thank you so much chair Herbold.,101,,
494,0.97,3291.588,3294.057,I wanted to flag a couple of concerns I have about this legislation.,101,,
495,0.97,3294.057,3308.571,The legislation is originally transmitted and included the Council's desire and wishes to move the 911 call center employees to the new community safety and communication center.,101,,
496,0.97,3308.571,3319.916,It did not include also moving parking enforcement officers to the community safety and communication center.,101,,
497,0.97,3319.916,3332.228,So there was another bill that proposed moving the parking enforcement officers to the Seattle Department of transportation rather than the community safety and communications center.,101,,
498,0.97,3332.228,3348.478,"And now we have before us, a bill that merges the two bills into one but transfers all of these functions we are discussing including the PEO's to the new community safety and communications center.",101,,
499,0.97,3348.478,3379.075,"So I'm just flagging, based on my conversations with folks at Sdot and other folks within the city coalition, that I continue to think that the original two bills as proposed by the Mayor were headed in the right direction and continue to think that the PEO's should go to S.D.O.T.",101,,
500,0.97,3379.075,3399.062,As individuals whose functions are primarily designed currently to manage the Right- Of-Way and adding it just makes a lot more sense from an administration and operations perspective to have those functions go to S.D.O.T.,101,,
501,0.97,3399.062,3403.633,Rather than to the community safety and communications center.,101,,
502,0.97,3403.633,3445.442,"So Unfortunately, I just can't--while I support the underlined legislation of moving the 911 call center employees to the community safety communication center, I am not currently a supportive of the shift of the PEO's to the Cscc and would be interested in resolving that particular concern before the full Council has an opportunity to consider this Council bill.",101,,
503,0.97,3445.442,3447.01,Thank you.,102,,
504,0.97,3447.01,3449.646,If we can take a quick minute to respond to that.,102,,
505,0.97,3449.646,3465.061,"The reason why we introduced this bill to replace the bills that were referred by the executives is because the bills referred to the executive, the second bill that transferred the PEO's to S.D.O.T.",102,,
506,0.97,3465.061,3468.731,Was simply not in alignment with the vote that we take unanimously during the budget process.,102,,
507,0.97,3468.731,3496.159,We all voted on the ordinance that not only changed the name from of their own neck--very narrowly focused Department that was only going to house 911 and changed the name from only a communication center to community safety and communication center and the ordinance itself included the intent to transfer both 911 dispatch and PEO's as well.,102,,
508,0.97,3496.159,3541.638,"And so I worked to have Lisa develop a replacement bill that reflected the Council's already established (Indiscernible) and it is not just the Council intent but it is a large workforce of over 100 PEO's that are telling us that their preference is to go from SPD to the new division without the PEO's going to the new division, the division would only hold 911 and would be an narrowly focused Department.",102,,
509,0.97,3541.638,3574.671,And it will not be capturing the leadership and the direction we are hearing from a lack workforce . I'm hoping that we can move this forward today and that there is some urgency as it relates to the June 1ST state.,102,,
510,0.97,3574.671,3584.981,I look forward to having ongoing conversations.,102,,
511,0.97,3584.981,3586.683,"Are there other comments, Congress member Louis?",102,,
512,0.97,3586.683,3587.684,"Thank you, Madam chair.",103,,
513,0.97,3587.684,3591.454,And thank you for bringing this forward.,103,,
514,0.97,3591.454,3617.113,The overall project of the future role of our parking enforcement officers and some kind of heightened civil enforcement officer position is something that I remain extremely interested in and I appreciate this next step to move this conversation forward to that next phase.,103,,
515,0.97,3617.113,3641.404,"Two years ago, the city of Philadelphia voted to essentially put the same context into the charter to elevate their equivalent of parking enforcement officers into a position that would take on a bigger civil enforcement role to better serve the people of Philadelphia and take care of some of those issues that are Citable but not criminal in nature.",103,,
516,0.97,3641.404,3667.13,"One of my concerns here is that there continues to be some disagreement in the workforce because it is true that the rank and file parking enforcement field, which I have been talking to and am very supportive of, has a divergent view from the unit that represents the supervisors.",103,,
517,0.97,3667.13,3682.879,"And to me, that indicates that there is still division, despite the rank-and-file position--and as a Rank-And- file Union member, I feel deeply about.",103,,
518,0.97,3682.879,3690.153,It is not a United workplace.,103,,
519,0.97,3690.153,3692.088,So I would appreciate more time to sort that out.,103,,
520,0.97,3692.088,3697.994,I saw the E-mail from Sean Van Eyck this morning.,103,,
521,0.97,3697.994,3707.87,Sean who is unable to make it for public comment but recognizes the project 17 and just indicated some lingering concerns.,103,,
522,0.97,3707.87,3722.652,"And I would like to see before we go forward beef with this move, what we can do to reconcile some of the concerns where there is division in the workplace.",103,,
523,0.97,3722.652,3724.721,Because I do want to see it go to this new Department.,103,,
524,0.97,3724.721,3728.191,I want to see it form a nucleus of the new Department.,103,,
525,0.97,3728.191,3751.047,I want to see a future where a lot of the sayings that are currently being done that are noncriminal in nature by sworn uniformed officers can instead be done by this diverse workforce who has a strong track record and history of community involvement.,103,,
526,0.97,3751.047,3767.163,"But I want to make sure we do it in a way that is not dividing the management and rank-and-file of the unit, both of which are represented and just setting up a difficult transition.",103,,
527,0.97,3767.163,3777.373,"So Maybe that can be worked out with a little bit more time, to figure out more of the protects and concerns in this.",103,,
528,0.97,3777.373,3794.09,"Because I do think it would be a shame if this unit simply went to S.D.O.T., where the future role was more constrained implicitly by placement in the unit.",103,,
529,0.97,3794.09,3811.607,I also don't want to move them forward when there is not a unanimity on long the workforce in question and taking on a trail--blazing a new trail in a department we are creating.,103,,
530,0.97,3811.607,3831.627,And so I think that that is a request similar to counsel member Gonzales to maybe hold this a little bit and have some of those conversations rather than take action today.,103,,
531,0.97,3831.627,3836.399,I believe there are some implications we should consider as it relates to holding the legislation.,104,,
532,0.97,3836.399,3851.314,I mentioned the June 1ST state that the Council moved from the Mayor's proposed January 1ST state and so we are striving to meet that goal.,104,,
533,0.97,3851.314,3869.265,And want to just talk a little bit about if there are unintended consequences of the delay.,104,,
534,0.97,3869.265,3869.465,Lisa.,104,,
535,0.97,3869.465,3874.67,You will see on my staff memo that I did identify some consequences should the Council not take any action.,105,,
536,0.97,3874.67,3889.585,Basically that would mean that either the executive or the Council will need to pass legislation that would provide for an ongoing cash flow so that the executives can pay the salaries of the PEO's if they stay with SPD.,105,,
537,0.97,3889.585,3899.061,Right now the Council's proviso would have that funding stream cut off June 1ST and transferred to the Cscc.,105,,
538,0.97,3899.061,3903.065,"As designed by the Council, right?",106,,
539,0.97,3903.065,3903.332,Yes.,107,,
540,0.97,3903.332,3924.62,We were anticipating this as a next step that we need to take and we wanted to ensure that we could take it by June again instead of by January as previously proposed by the Mayor.,108,,
541,0.97,3924.62,3933.929,I did reach out to CBO to find out if they had up Revisionary plan and they didn't have anything in place yet.,109,,
542,0.97,3933.929,3941.07,But there would need to be some action taken.,109,,
543,0.97,3941.07,3944.507,And I believe the payment issue also affects 911 dispatch and not just parking enforcement officers.,110,,
544,0.97,3944.507,3953.582,If it was not transferred by June 1ST.,111,,
545,0.97,3953.582,3953.983,Thank you.,112,,
546,0.97,3953.983,3972.368,"With that in mind, we have some time between now and June 1ST at a council meeting that we would have a discussion.",113,,
547,0.97,3972.368,3977.573,But I'm inclined to want to move this forward.,113,,
548,0.97,3977.573,3980.309,"Councilmember Lewis and Council President Gonzcez, I see both of your hands at.",113,,
549,0.97,3980.309,3987.083,Let's hear Councilmember Gonzcez first.,113,,
550,0.97,3987.083,3987.983,Thank you so much.,114,,
551,0.97,3987.983,4000.363,I just wanted to address a couple points that I'm hearing right now in this discussion which I appreciate the opportunity to have in this Committee.,114,,
552,0.97,4000.363,4021.517,"The first thing I want to say is, in terms of the argument that the Council unanimously supported a position before to move the PEO's out of the Seattle police Department and into a community safety Department, I don't dispute that that occurred.",114,,
553,0.97,4021.517,4042.638,"I will say however that in sort of the subsequent months, which many have passed by, I have had the opportunity to more deeply engage both on some of the operations and management concerns being expressed by S.D.O.T.",114,,
554,0.97,4042.638,4051.047,But also in terms of having ongoing conversations with representatives from Protech and also getting a better understanding of the position.,114,,
555,0.97,4051.047,4080.676,"I will say that as a reminder, when we were taking this particular issue under consideration, my memory is that even then, there were expressions of concerns by the two bargaining unit representatives within the parking enforcement unit about where the function should be placed.",114,,
556,0.97,4080.676,4104.133,"On so Unfortunately, those concerns have not been reconciled or resolved and in this case, you know, it feels like we are moving this forward in a manner that isn't allowing us a better opportunity to reconcile those differences between those two bargaining units.",114,,
557,0.97,4104.133,4109.872,So I wanted to address that.,114,,
558,0.97,4109.872,4120.216,"Secondly, it was mentioned that if we don't move the Peos into the community safety division, it will be a very narrow scope Department.",114,,
559,0.97,4120.216,4132.561,"And I just wanted to remind us that this is sort of a first step in building the new division and certainly right now, the division would include the 911 communications center.",114,,
560,0.97,4132.561,4151.847,"It also could, in order to fulfill the community safety component of the title of this division, we could also transfer--I think the intent is to transfer other functions into the division but it will just take us a little bit of time to do that.",114,,
561,0.97,4151.847,4162.124,"So things like the community service officers which I believe should be transferred over to this Department, crisis intervention teams, mental health providers.",114,,
562,0.97,4162.124,4181.877,"I think those are other functions that can and will likely find their way to the division . So I don't want to leave the public with the understanding that if the public--I'm sorry, if the parking enforcement officer function isn't transferred into the division, it is effectively just a 911 communications center.",114,,
563,0.97,4181.877,4193.556,I don't think that is the vision or is where we will end up with this division ultimately.,114,,
564,0.97,4193.556,4208.771,"And Lastly, on the June 1ST 2021 deadline, I appreciate, Lisa, you offering a little more information as it relates to that Deadlin.",114,,
565,0.97,4208.771,4215.811,I think that these PEO's would have to be paid regardless of which division they are in.,114,,
566,0.97,4215.811,4223.619,So I don't understand what the problem is.,114,,
567,0.97,4223.619,4224.82,What are you trying to flag?,114,,
568,0.97,4224.82,4229.992,Were we planning on not paying them out of SPD?,114,,
569,0.97,4229.992,4231.26,I don't understand what the concern is.,114,,
570,0.97,4231.26,4237.099,It's not like we're just just not going to pay them after June 1ST.,114,,
571,0.97,4237.099,4241.437,So what is the issue?,114,,
572,0.97,4241.437,4262.958,There was a relatively complicated budget proviso adopted by counsel in the 2021 budget that recognized basically setting up appropriations to pay out of the Cscc and then provided temporary authority for SPD to pay for these positions until June 1ST.,115,,
573,0.97,4262.958,4279.742,The temporary authority expires June 1ST unless counsel passes legislation to some other affect . so that would mean the appropriation authority remains with the Cscc but the positions remain with SPD which present a problem.,115,,
574,0.97,4279.742,4297.559,And so that is where the executive for the Council would need to--the executive could propose a fix and counsel would likely need to pass legislation to make a temporary patch.,115,,
575,0.97,4297.559,4299.762,Effectively it would be to extend the temporary authorization?,116,,
576,0.97,4299.762,4301.03,"That would be one of the ways to do it, yes.",117,,
577,0.97,4301.03,4306.568,.,118,,
578,0.97,4306.568,4306.869,Okay.,119,,
579,0.97,4306.869,4317.313,That is helpful to know.,119,,
580,0.97,4320.282,4331.393,I just continue to be very concerned about the division between the parking enforcement officers in the parking enforcement officers supervisors and I really think that we gain a lot by having a unified effort here.,119,,
581,0.97,4331.393,4333.996,I don't know if we will be able to accomplish that.,119,,
582,0.97,4333.996,4343.372,I know that we have all been collectively come in our on rights reporting on trying to figure out how to reconcile the differences between those two units.,119,,
583,0.97,4343.372,4356.251,"I do see Sean Van Eyck's E-mail to us today talking about how from the protects perspective, S.D.O.T.",119,,
584,0.97,4356.251,4356.752,And says that S.D.O.T.,119,,
585,0.97,4356.752,4363.759,Is a natural fit for the PEO unit and every example provided and a similar move by other metropolitan cities in the U.S.,119,,
586,0.97,4363.759,4368.163,Have have the respective units Transitioned to the city's Department of transportation.,119,,
587,0.97,4368.163,4392.187,"I want to make sure that we are doing something that is consistent with what the models are across the country and again, I am persuaded by the arguments that I have heard from Protech and S.D.O.T.",119,,
588,0.97,4392.187,4396.091,About needing to place the PEO unit in a function within S.D.O.T.,119,,
589,0.97,4396.091,4402.998,And was just sort of hopeful that we would be able to end up in that place.,119,,
590,0.97,4402.998,4419.414,"That I understand, Councilmember Herbold, that you have an interest moving this forward and if you want to move out of committee today, I would plan on voting no on this bill unfortunately at this point.",119,,
591,0.97,4419.414,4425.12,"But would be, as a result of the report, give us a couple more weeks to see if we can sort this out.",119,,
592,0.97,4425.12,4429.958,But it would effectively get it out of your Committee.,119,,
593,0.97,4429.958,4430.526,Councilmember Lewis.,120,,
594,0.97,4430.526,4431.16,Thank you Madam chair.,121,,
595,0.97,4431.16,4437.933,This is just a question for central staff.,121,,
596,0.97,4437.933,4444.006,Could you maybe go over a little bit.,121,,
597,0.97,4444.006,4456.151,"Like are there any practical implications in terms of depending on the Department, you know, what the day-to-day parking enforcement of the officers will be?",121,,
598,0.97,4456.151,4462.624,And where the equipment is stored and how they are dispatched and hr.,121,,
599,0.97,4462.624,4468.864,Just all of this kind of consideration to the workplace.,121,,
600,0.97,4468.864,4472.534,Is there any relevant Úconsideration between the choices we are making?,121,,
601,0.97,4472.534,4484.513,"I do think it would be good to just hear practically speaking, what the bottom line is.",121,,
602,0.97,4484.513,4494.389,I think one of the bigger factors that has come into play in terms of practicality is the question of whether the PEO's boys could be expanded.,122,,
603,0.97,4494.389,4512.908,I think that question is the same regardless of frankly where the unit ends up because a lot of those duties the officers are requesting authority for are subject to bargaining and that bargaining will take a long time very likely.,122,,
604,0.97,4512.908,4525.12,And so I think those changes are not something that are likely to happen quickly.,122,,
605,0.97,4525.12,4526.788,"In terms of an administration, I have heard S.D.O.T.",122,,
606,0.97,4526.788,4535.23,Argue that they have the administrative structure set up and they are a functioning Department with the divisions and backup help support for hr.,122,,
607,0.97,4535.23,4540.135,They are arguing that we need to go right away to absorb a new unit.,122,,
608,0.97,4540.135,4558.654,"At the same time, acting interim director Lombard for the community safety communications center is working on setting up that structure also and has retained some temporary (Indiscernible) to get things going.",122,,
609,0.97,4558.654,4560.455,And so that is as much.,122,,
610,0.97,4560.455,4571.867,I don't know much more in terms of what it takes to set up a whole new Department.,122,,
611,0.97,4571.867,4578.941,The Council's intent has been apparent in setting up this new community safety center ever since December of last year.,122,,
612,0.97,4578.941,4587.983,There have been times when the executives have put the (Indiscernible) into play.,122,,
613,0.97,4587.983,4589.117,"Did that answer your question, Councilmember?",122,,
614,0.97,4589.117,4589.451,Yes.,123,,
615,0.97,4589.451,4594.456,"It sounds like, just to Rephrase.",123,,
616,0.97,4594.456,4597.859,It sounds like there is an argument that S.D.O.T.,123,,
617,0.97,4597.859,4606.268,"Is just better situated because it is an existing Department, to kind of absorb the unit.",123,,
618,0.97,4606.268,4612.407,But it doesn't really sound like the day today of the parking enforcement officers will be all that effective regardless of the choice.,123,,
619,0.97,4612.407,4620.582,It doesn't really sound like there will be any issue or gap of service or anything like that based on the decision made here today.,123,,
620,0.97,4620.582,4632.894,And totally stipulate to the expanded role and duty of the officers.,124,,
621,0.97,4632.894,4638.233,I appreciate that that will take a considerable amount of additional work regardless of where they go.,124,,
622,0.97,4638.233,4646.008,"In terms of the immediate implications, it doesn't really sound like there is that big of a difference.",124,,
623,0.97,4646.008,4661.69,Both entities would have to come up with a new working agreement on how they would interact with the police Department because the parking enforcement functions do overlap with the patrol functions and so there would need to be new agreements regardless of where the Department ends up.,125,,
624,0.97,4661.69,4670.766,"Go ahead, Alex.",126,,
625,0.97,4670.766,4685.013,I don't want to speak for the executives but my conversations with staff have indicated that those day-to-day (Indiscernible) would remain the same regardless if the unit was transferred.,127,,
626,0.97,4685.013,4692.32,"For example, the offices they operate out I would be maintained regardless of the Department.",127,,
627,0.97,4692.32,4692.754,Appreciate it.,128,,
628,0.97,4692.754,4701.296,"Appreciated, Alex.",129,,
629,0.97,4701.296,4703.198,What else?,130,,
630,0.97,4703.198,4712.507,"I also believe, Lisa, we allocated some additional funding beyond what was proposed for hr functions for the new Department.",130,,
631,0.97,4712.507,4713.008,Is that correct?,130,,
632,0.97,4713.008,4721.416,Those have been intended to be part of the appropriation but was not the case.,131,,
633,0.97,4721.416,4728.39,That is part of what the executive will be asking for more support from in the next budget.,131,,
634,0.97,4728.39,4728.89,That is helpful.,132,,
635,0.97,4728.89,4729.324,All right.,133,,
636,0.97,4729.324,4741.236,Looking to see if there is any more hand raising.,133,,
637,0.97,4741.236,4746.374,And this will clearly be a divided report.,133,,
638,0.97,4746.374,4756.818,"That hopefully will give us a little time to have some continued conversations before full counsel on May 4TH, I believe it is.",133,,
639,0.97,4756.818,4771.299,"And so, with that, if there are no further discussions, --",134,,
640,0.97,4771.299,4774.402,"That would be may 19th, 2 weeks from today?",135,,
641,0.97,4774.402,4774.903,Is that a holiday?,136,,
642,0.97,4774.903,4779.541,Yes.,137,,
643,0.97,4779.541,4780.375,It is a holiday.,137,,
644,0.97,4780.375,4786.181,I think it is two Mondays.,137,,
645,0.97,4786.181,4791.953,May 24th.,138,,
646,0.97,4791.953,4793.088,I only heard the fourth part.,139,,
647,0.97,4793.088,4806.301,Council rules provide unless otherwise authorized by the Council and Committee chair that the community report should be reported to the second committee meeting after the date of the recommendation.,140,,
648,0.97,4806.301,4811.706,Okay.,141,,
649,0.97,4811.706,4817.913,So that would be may 24th.,142,,
650,0.97,4817.913,4820.115,So I will move that counsel bill listed on the agenda.,142,,
651,0.97,4820.115,4824.719,Is there a second?,142,,
652,0.97,4824.719,4825.02,Second.,143,,
653,0.97,4825.02,4831.426,Thank you.,144,,
654,0.97,4831.426,4836.464,Is there any further discussion?,144,,
655,0.97,4836.464,4841.603,"Seeing no further discussion, will court please call role?",145,,
656,0.97,4841.603,4850.111,Council President Gonzcez.,146,,
657,0.97,4850.111,4850.345,No.,147,,
658,0.97,4850.345,4850.879,Councilmember Lewis.,148,,
659,0.97,4850.879,4851.146,Yes.,149,,
660,0.97,4851.146,4851.746,Councilmember Morales.,150,,
661,0.97,4851.746,4852.314,I'm going to abstain.,151,,
662,0.97,4852.314,4853.648,Councilmember Sawant.,152,,
663,0.97,4853.648,4854.516,Abstain.,153,,
664,0.97,4854.516,4861.356,Councilmember Herbold.,154,,
665,0.97,4861.356,4861.623,Yes.,155,,
666,0.97,4861.623,4863.758,Two in favor and one opposed and two Abstained.,156,,
667,0.97,4863.758,4870.599,Thank you.,157,,
668,0.97,4870.599,4877.405,Let's move forward.,158,,
669,0.97,4877.405,4886.982,I want to be clear that this does move through with yes as the Abstentions do not count against the vote.,159,,
670,0.97,4886.982,4888.617,It turns out it would move forward even if it failed.,160,,
671,0.97,4888.617,4889.05,There we go.,161,,
672,0.97,4889.05,4898.193,"In that case, it would just move forward.",162,,
673,0.97,4898.193,4899.394,"So in this case, moving forward.",162,,
674,0.97,4899.394,4909.704,And we will 981.,162,,
675,0.97,4915.143,4940.302,An ordinance amending ordinance 126237 which adopted the 2021 budget including the 2021-2026 capital improvement program changing appropriations to various departments and budget control levels and from various funds in the budget and adding or modifying previous shows.,162,,
676,0.97,4940.302,4961.556,A quick introductory comment before I turn it over . We like to start the conversation around this particular bill by recognizing that the Seattle police Department's 2021 hiring budget is and has always been fully funded.,163,,
677,0.97,4961.556,4964.059,This legislation would not impact that.,163,,
678,0.97,4964.059,4975.57,The legislation is scheduled for discussion and possible vote.,163,,
679,0.97,4975.57,4977.072,And there is some background that has brought us to this moment.,163,,
680,0.97,4977.072,4979.374,We have heard this bill in Committee a couple times now.,163,,
681,0.97,4979.374,4981.943,I think this might be the third or fourth time.,163,,
682,0.97,4981.943,4997.692,"In March, the monitor overseeing the consent decree ent specific questions to t police Department and the police Department recently sent answers to those questions to the monitor.",163,,
683,0.97,4997.692,5015.777,"As I noted on a few occasions now, the committee delayed all considerations of the legislation in order to allow the police Department to respond to the monitor because the monitor let us know in no uncertain terms that it was the expectation.",163,,
684,0.97,5015.777,5027.889,The monitor has now responded to the police departments feedback on the bill and that Email was sent to committee members last Friday.,163,,
685,0.97,5027.889,5063.725,"As far as orienting us about the bill we have in front of us now, the legislation before the committee provides a $5.4 million investment to Ameliorate the reduced number of officers including funding for community service officers, crime prevention Coordinators, fulfilling public information staffing request recommended by the city auditor, funding for evidence storage as recommended by the inspector general, and some funding for civilian crisis response in the human services Department.",163,,
686,0.97,5063.725,5072.367,It cut $2 million from the police Department budget and puts those dollars toward Participatory budgeting.,163,,
687,0.97,5072.367,5083.645,It makes available additional funding to the police Department through the release of proviso.,163,,
688,0.97,5083.645,5101.162,Related to the salary savings that SPD is experiencing because of higher than anticipated Patricians.,163,,
689,0.97,5101.162,5122.016,"The fact that the monitors Email States that the court and the monitor are concerned about the reduction of funding to the police Department, it says that SPD is at risk of not being able to deliver key management and operational requirements as personnel has been allocated to fulfill critical patrol duties due to separate tradition of officers.",163,,
690,0.97,5122.016,5126.754,And the monitor goes on to emphasize that the consent decree is a legal agreement.,163,,
691,0.97,5126.754,5155.717,"In recognition of that feedback, we are allowing for additional funding for SPD to use its salary savings to the tune of an additional $5 million in addition to funding the priority items that SPD has themselves identified for us in previous meetings in this bill.",163,,
692,0.97,5155.717,5177.839,"The Legislaion before the committee is worth noting that the $2 million cut, that is still part of this bill even though there is a $2 million cut there is an allowance and release of a proviso that allows SPD to use $5 million in salary savings.",163,,
693,0.97,5177.839,5183.745,This is on the context of $360 million budget.,163,,
694,0.97,5183.745,5185.78,Those are my introductory remarks.,163,,
695,0.97,5185.78,5193.788,I think I will hand it over to Greg to walk us through maybe a little more detail.,163,,
696,0.97,5193.788,5198.259,Thank you Madam chair and good morning members of the committee.,164,,
697,0.97,5198.259,5205.366,You make my job very easy because you know the legislation really well.,164,,
698,0.97,5205.366,5221.816,I am going to share my screen and share a Powerpoint that I think will more or less provide a visual for the changes you were talking about.,164,,
699,0.97,5221.816,5224.619,Can someone tell me verbally that you can see it?,164,,
700,0.97,5224.619,5227.121,We can see it.,165,,
701,0.97,5227.121,5236.397,"To start out with, and overview of what the substitute that is before the committee today does.",166,,
702,0.97,5236.397,5244.472,The original bill as you know was introduced months ago in January.,166,,
703,0.97,5244.472,5262.69,"In the last public safety committee meeting where this bill was heard, there was a substitution where the investments that Councilmember Herbold talked about were Weaved into the amendment, Weaved into the original bill.",166,,
704,0.97,5262.69,5268.763,Now we have a substitute bill that does many things . So I will provide a quick overview of those things.,166,,
705,0.97,5268.763,5274.569,And tell you what today's proposed amendment what do.,166,,
706,0.97,5274.569,5323.017,"By way of background, the investments that Councilmember Herbold talked about are listed here on this table . What you can see on the top line projected salary savings available, $13 million, that is actually an estimate made by central staff on April 27. it is sort of Aden up to estimate and an annual figure . If given the separations that have happened so far this year, if the Department continues to see separations, but it levels out at some rate, then it is possible that SPD could see up to $13 million of savings in salary savings.",166,,
707,0.97,5323.017,5334.729,"If it does not level out and it continues at the trends that have been seen in the last several months, there will be more than $13,000.",166,,
708,0.97,5334.729,5347.108,"Just for the estimate, we are saying up to 13,000 and hoping that trends return to something more normal.",166,,
709,0.97,5347.108,5347.442,I will stop.,166,,
710,0.97,5347.442,5348.109,There may be questions on that.,166,,
711,0.97,5348.109,5354.048,I want to make sure I am saying that in a way that is understandable.,166,,
712,0.97,5354.048,5359.554,I am looking to see if there are any hands raised . and I am not seeing any.,167,,
713,0.97,5359.554,5367.662,"I just want to--Greg, you said $13,000 a couple times.",168,,
714,0.97,5367.662,5370.565,I want everybody to know it is $13 million.,168,,
715,0.97,5370.565,5371.365,Yes.,169,,
716,0.97,5371.365,5387.682,"$13 million . In my conservative estimate there would be up to $13 million in savings . If we continue to see the kinds of separations that we have seen in the last few months, there would be more.",169,,
717,0.97,5387.682,5388.483,That is how I would summarize it.,169,,
718,0.97,5388.483,5392.553,Moving into the investments.,169,,
719,0.97,5392.553,5405.666,"Before we do that, I want to restate something that I think Councilmember Morales made in a previous meeting.",170,,
720,0.97,5405.666,5409.103,"It is not $13 million that is floating around in SPD's budget now, that is your assessment of how much would be available over the course of the year.",170,,
721,0.97,5409.103,5410.905,That is correct.,171,,
722,0.97,5410.905,5418.179,"That takes their current separations, which through the first quarter were 58.",171,,
723,0.97,5418.179,5420.314,And the current hires which through the first quarter were 30.,171,,
724,0.97,5420.314,5435.83,"And sort of projects out that they would have somewhere around nine more separations per month and somewhere around eight more hires per month . If it worked out that way, at the end of the year they would have $13 million in salary savings.",171,,
725,0.97,5435.83,5457.118,"Just very high level, what this bill does, the substitute bill that we voted to have before us in our last meeting, very high level, it uses about $5.4 million to pay for a bunch of things.",172,,
726,0.97,5457.118,5468.663,"Many of which SPD asked us to help them Fund, rather than doing the full $5.4 million cut.",172,,
727,0.97,5468.663,5482.643,It funds $2 million for Participatory budgeting instead of $5.4 billion--$5.4 million.,172,,
728,0.97,5482.643,5490.151,It freeze up $5 million in what is projected to be $13 million in salary savings to give SPD the flexibility they have been requesting.,172,,
729,0.97,5490.151,5491.352,That is a good summary.,173,,
730,0.97,5491.352,5501.963,I will not go too much into detail unless members have questions on these specific investments . I know we have been talking about it for several months.,173,,
731,0.97,5501.963,5506.601,Let me know if you want me to go into detail on any of these specific investments.,173,,
732,0.97,5506.601,5521.816,"So the other major change in the substitute that currently sits before the committee, it revised one of the Provisos it in the adopted budget.",173,,
733,0.97,5521.816,5545.139,That proviso was holding $5 million in authority and requiring that the Department not spend that money until a future preparation had been made . that particular proviso is intended to capture salary savings that SPD accrues throughout the year.,173,,
734,0.97,5545.139,5566.861,"The substitute that is before you, more or less eliminates that proviso and replaces it with a new proviso that would allow SPD access to that funding, as long as they complied with some reporting requirements, specifically around staffing.",173,,
735,0.97,5566.861,5570.064,So the Council could continue to watch the staffing situation at SPD.,173,,
736,0.97,5570.064,5573.668,I will stop and ask if there are any questions on that.,173,,
737,0.97,5573.668,5615.509,"Is there concern that SPD potentially would not comply with those reporting requirements? unless we lifted the proviso or did the Phased- in lifting of it--I guess I am just trying to understand, do we have other ways as a Council to compel that reporting, rather than through as we get those reports, releasing the proviso?",174,,
738,0.97,5615.509,5616.143,"Thank you, Councilmember.",175,,
739,0.97,5616.143,5622.783,The other way you have to compel that reporting is the statement of legislative intent . and you did that.,175,,
740,0.97,5622.783,5632.493,"You adopted a statement of legislative intent that asked them for regular monthly reports, reports that have historically been provided on a monthly basis or periodically.",175,,
741,0.97,5632.493,5633.027,They go back and forth.,175,,
742,0.97,5633.027,5650.444,"The department generally will keep the Council up-to-date with detailed reports . starting in January, the Department stopped providing projections as part of this reports.",175,,
743,0.97,5650.444,5657.418,No longer do those reports contain any information or any data on how many folks they expect to hire or how many folks they expect will leave.,175,,
744,0.97,5657.418,5690.785,"You have already asked them for that, via the statement of legislative intent . and they are saying that they are not going to be sending it . So this proviso is a step in a further direction to try to compel them to provide that information . I would say that in absolute fairness, there is really no way that anyone could have predicted what would have happened in the last six months in terms of separations.",175,,
745,0.97,5690.785,5696.957,And it is understandable that they are hesitant to provide the data going forward.,175,,
746,0.97,5696.957,5717.578,"However, they do have access to information, specifically folks who have submitted their retirement paperwork, or the number of recruits they are planning to hire, as they gather eligible folks out of the testing pool and as they interview them.",175,,
747,0.97,5717.578,5729.724,"So they have some capacity to do some projections . certainly more than the Council does, without that information.",175,,
748,0.97,5729.724,5742.203,This would ask them to continue to do the best job they could and provide that information to the Council . taking a step forward in requiring that information to be sent.,175,,
749,0.97,5742.203,5745.539,"Unrelated question, Greg.",176,,
750,0.97,5745.539,5763.124,"Has SPD indicated what they would use the salary savings for, in the event they were released per these conditions?",176,,
751,0.97,5763.124,5774.969,Spd has said they would use their salary savings for many of the items in this table.,177,,
752,0.97,5774.969,5778.839,Indeed the items in this table largely came from them.,177,,
753,0.97,5778.839,5779.273,Many of them did.,177,,
754,0.97,5779.273,5781.942,The separation pay.,177,,
755,0.97,5781.942,5788.883,"It needs, civilian staffing.",177,,
756,0.97,5788.883,5791.452,"Additional resources for public disclosure, although not necessarily in this configuration.",177,,
757,0.97,5791.452,5806.167,They have requested--they have indicated that they need to have evidence storage enhancements done.,177,,
758,0.97,5806.167,5818.479,"In a lot of ways these are already SPD requests and would be used--they would use their salary savings, at least on the separation pay and it needs and civilian staffing.",177,,
759,0.97,5818.479,5819.013,Okay.,178,,
760,0.97,5819.013,5824.618,Thank you.,178,,
761,0.97,5824.618,5826.921,I will move forward.,179,,
762,0.97,5826.921,5836.096,Now I will move into the amendment that is proposed today that is before you.,179,,
763,0.97,5836.096,5844.438,"Before you move into that, I just want to use dates that I have worked with you to develop this amendments.",180,,
764,0.97,5844.438,5852.646,"We were seeking law Department review, which we got last night.",180,,
765,0.97,5852.646,5855.049,This amendments has not been posted publicly.,180,,
766,0.97,5855.049,5868.863,And so I am inclined--it is virtually the same as the version that my colleagues on this committee received on Friday.,180,,
767,0.97,5868.863,5874.668,But I am inclined to hold the amendment to full council.,180,,
768,0.97,5874.668,5894.188,"Unless I hear otherwise from my colleagues . Just out of an interest to make sure that the public has access to the amendment, which because of the late law Department review, they were unable to get it posted to the agenda.",180,,
769,0.97,5894.188,5894.788,Thank you Madam chair.,181,,
770,0.97,5894.788,5897.157,Would you like me to get over it or have me step back?,181,,
771,0.97,5897.157,5905.899,I still want you to go over it.,182,,
772,0.97,5905.899,5912.873,"This colleagues feel strongly we should act on it now, I want to hear that.",182,,
773,0.97,5912.873,5916.31,And I want to have the benefit of the discussion around the amendment here in the committee.,182,,
774,0.97,5916.31,5918.412,Thank you.,183,,
775,0.97,5918.412,5934.862,"The most significant change but your amendment would make Madam chair, it would eliminate another proviso, another restriction on the Department.",183,,
776,0.97,5934.862,5969.963,"There was $2.5 million of proviso in the adopted 2021 budget that would require future ordinance, future authorization and along with the proviso I request that SPD and labor relations addition the public safety Civil-Service committee to authorize 35 out of order layoffs in accordance with the principles identified in resolution 31962 that was passed last year . You will recall that many of the principles that are in that resolution have to do with Fficer misconduct, specifically around sustained complaints.",183,,
777,0.97,5969.963,6011.538,"So this was a hold on authority to see if there would be a way that layoffs could be focused on officers who had sustained complaints, sustained misconduct complaints . and included in that would be officers that are part of what is called the gray list . The Brady list is a disclosure of law enforcement officers whose involvement in a case as an arresting officer, investigator or witness, is in question because of a history of dishonesty or misconduct.",183,,
778,0.97,6011.538,6022.015,The goal of this particular $2.5 million out of order layoffs proviso was to identify the officers and see if they could be Prioritized for layoff.,183,,
779,0.97,6022.015,6031.625,Over the last few months it has become clear that that is not possible for several reasons.,183,,
780,0.97,6031.625,6051.045,"The two most significant reasons or because the public safety Civil-Service rules would allow any officer laid off, regardless of the reason whether misconduct or other, to be placed on a reinstatement register and Rehired when SPD is hiring new officers . as the chair has indicated, SPD is fully funded for their hiring plan.",183,,
781,0.97,6051.045,6056.683,So any--and they are hiring as quickly and as much as they can.,183,,
782,0.97,6056.683,6064.158,"Placing an officer, laid up officer on a reinstatement register would mean they would be Rehired.",183,,
783,0.97,6064.158,6074.601,"Additionally, the Rcw Precludes any adverse personnel action to be taken against a police officer solely because they are on the Brady list.",183,,
784,0.97,6074.601,6089.683,"For these reasons, it becomes somewhat impractical to seek out of order layoffs, specifically on the misconduct issue.",183,,
785,0.97,6089.683,6100.16,This amendment would eliminate that proviso and free up the $2.5 million for the Department to use and as you can see in the second one it adds some intent language to explain why that proviso is being dropped.,183,,
786,0.97,6100.16,6102.496,And I have just gone over that.,183,,
787,0.97,6102.496,6109.069,I will stop and ask if there are any questions.,183,,
788,0.97,6109.069,6113.907,I am not hearing anything.,183,,
789,0.97,6113.907,6117.611,Any questions?,184,,
790,0.97,6117.611,6117.845,Okay.,184,,
791,0.97,6117.845,6121.482,A couple more things --,185,,
792,0.97,6121.482,6126.019,"Councilmember Herbold, sorry.",186,,
793,0.97,6126.019,6127.087,Go ahead.,187,,
794,0.97,6127.087,6130.524,That was my fault.,188,,
795,0.97,6130.524,6132.96,I was a little delayed.,188,,
796,0.97,6132.96,6177.271,"I think not necessarily wanting to speak to the specific proposal here, I wanted to respond to your inquiry about whether or not the committee should hold on this amendment or take action now . I think several of us on this Committee, in a different context, have had an opportunity to really wrestle with the underlying issue presented by the out of order layoffs proviso that was originally adopted by the city council.",188,,
797,0.97,6177.271,6188.949,"I would be prepared to vote on this particular amendment, if you as the chair decided to call it to a vote during committee today.",188,,
798,0.97,6188.949,6196.557,I just wanted to signal that preparedness for you as you think about how you want to manage this particular issue.,188,,
799,0.97,6196.557,6219.112,It would be--I will say it would be my preference that we resolve this policy debate related to amendment 1 in the context of your Committee as opposed to saving debate on this particular amendment for full council.,188,,
800,0.97,6219.112,6219.513,Thank you.,189,,
801,0.97,6219.513,6223.717,That is exactly the kind of feedback I was looking for.,189,,
802,0.97,6223.717,6230.224,Any other strong feelings about that issue here?,189,,
803,0.97,6230.224,6235.429,From other Councilmembers . all right.,189,,
804,0.97,6235.429,6260.654,I would just say I agree with Councilmember Gonzalez . for the same reasons that Councilmember Gonzalez stated and a thorough study of this particular proposal around lifting the proviso and I would be prepared to vote on it today as well.,190,,
805,0.97,6260.654,6269.529,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,191,,
806,0.97,6269.529,6270.564,"Greg, do you have anything further for us?",192,,
807,0.97,6270.564,6276.37,Just a couple quick things and then I will step back.,193,,
808,0.97,6276.37,6286.546,There were changes made to section K and they acknowledge the release of the $5 million salary savings proviso to $2.5 million out of order proviso.,193,,
809,0.97,6286.546,6295.789,With the intention to allow SPD more flexibility in his budget to plan for emerging fiscal issues as well as staffing due to the shortage of officers.,193,,
810,0.97,6295.789,6300.761,As well as training needs.,193,,
811,0.97,6300.761,6309.469,And there are some technical corrections and changes that are made that I am not going to go into now.,193,,
812,0.97,6309.469,6315.475,"I can if anybody has any questions, but they are relatively insignificant, relative the other changes.",193,,
813,0.97,6315.475,6322.449,Now I will ask if--can stop showing my screen.,193,,
814,0.97,6322.449,6327.587,I seem to have an inability --,193,,
815,0.97,6327.587,6329.189,I have a question.,194,,
816,0.97,6329.189,6340.133,"On 3, Greg, this is discussing not just the proviso about out of parlor layoffs but the $5 million salary savings proviso.",194,,
817,0.97,6340.133,6346.406,Is that with the Council President had added to the budget last year?,194,,
818,0.97,6346.406,6346.64,Yes.,195,,
819,0.97,6346.64,6350.644,We talked about that earlier.,195,,
820,0.97,6350.644,6360.921,"It more or less eliminates the $5 million salary savings proviso, and then creates a new proviso that requires the staffing reports.",195,,
821,0.97,6360.921,6375.936,"Technically in the bill, it is in amendment but it is a rather confusing thing.",195,,
822,0.97,6375.936,6379.873,So I will simplify it by saying that the $5 million salary savings proviso that the Council President had added in the 2021 adopted budget is eliminated effectively.,195,,
823,0.97,6379.873,6382.676,This amendment or the --,196,,
824,0.97,6382.676,6389.282,By the substitute that the committee has already adopted.,197,,
825,0.97,6389.282,6390.05,Okay.,198,,
826,0.97,6390.05,6397.657,Thank you.,198,,
827,0.97,6397.657,6402.496,Thank you so much.,199,,
828,0.97,6402.496,6416.209,"If there is no further discussion about whether or not we should move the amendment, I move amendment 12 Council bill 1199 81. is there a second?",199,,
829,0.97,6416.209,6419.513,Second.,200,,
830,0.97,6419.513,6419.813,Okay.,201,,
831,0.97,6419.813,6424.885,Is there any discussion?,201,,
832,0.97,6424.885,6427.888,Councilmember Sawant.,202,,
833,0.97,6427.888,6437.931,Thank you . I had a point on the amendment and the bill and if you are okay I will make all my points at once.,203,,
834,0.97,6437.931,6439.533,Thank you.,204,,
835,0.97,6439.533,6466.927,As I said I will speak to the amendment and the bill and it will not be any surprise to Ou that I am op substitute amendment to essentially increase the police budget by an additional $2.5 million lifting another proviso.,205,,
836,0.97,6466.927,6483.343,The original proviso effectively said that the police could not access $2.5 million of the budget because the city Council was looking to out of order layoffs . and I will be voting no on the bill as a whole . In fact without the amendment it is a bill that has and that the effect of increasing police funding.,205,,
837,0.97,6483.343,6502.696,During the justice for George Floyd movement ordinary people filled the street to--thousands demanded Seattle defined the police by 50% to reduce the number of officers arresting communities of color and abusing peaceful protesters.,205,,
838,0.97,6502.696,6510.704,Councilmembers who initially claimed to support the man then began to use more and more Orwellian language to justify doing the opposite.,205,,
839,0.97,6510.704,6517.577,Do Councilmembers remember their promises to the justice for the George Floyd movement?,205,,
840,0.97,6517.577,6548.508,Today remember saying they wanted to define the police by 50% last summer [Indiscernible] do they remember saying they cannot reduce the number of offices in 2021 because they need to research out of order layoffs and as a side NOTE I would also note that doing police layoffs out of order was never a demand of the black lives matter movement.,205,,
841,0.97,6548.508,6561.855,Councilmembers are saying that--please forget that Councilmembers ever promised to reduce the size of the police force.,205,,
842,0.97,6561.855,6562.822,Frankly in my view this has become a farce.,205,,
843,0.97,6562.822,6575.669,The first draft of the bill reduced the budget by $5.4 million to compensate for the $5.4 million by which they illegally Overspent their budget last year.,205,,
844,0.97,6575.669,6585.612,Than the majority of the committee amended the original bill to make the police Department reduction to $3 million instead of $5.4 million but at the same time to lift a $5 million proviso.,205,,
845,0.97,6585.612,6605.932,"As I explained last time, I will quote my points, that means the substitute bill as a whole got up to $3 million from the police and gives the police access to $5 million so on balance it increases the available police budget by over $2 million.",205,,
846,0.97,6605.932,6618.678,"As Malcolm X. Famously said, if I stick a knife in my back--today's new substitute would release an additional $2.5 million by lifting another proviso.",205,,
847,0.97,6618.678,6633.693,"If this amendment passes, the net result of the bill will be to increase the police funding but a total of $4.5 million rather than cutting the police budget by $5.4 million.",205,,
848,0.97,6633.693,6642.235,"Essentially the consequence for going over budget last year, the police Department going over the budget last year is for them to get extra money this year.",205,,
849,0.97,6642.235,6647.04,This is what police accountability looks like to the political establishment.,205,,
850,0.97,6647.04,6659.285,I am voting no on this and it is no longer a bill to reduce the police budget and has become a bill to increase the police budget.,205,,
851,0.97,6659.285,6670.463,And the public comment people urged Council to return it to the original form . I would be happy to support and amendment like that.,205,,
852,0.97,6670.463,6691.484,"I am not permitted to make that motion--I want to stress that if another Councilmember made that motion I would vote, yes.",205,,
853,0.97,6691.484,6700.994,I would like to respond to the excuse that is circulated that the city council cannot Defund the police without the agreement of the Federal monitor.,205,,
854,0.97,6700.994,6702.362,"Councilmembers vote on the budget, not the Federal monitor.",205,,
855,0.97,6702.362,6703.463,Councilmembers are responsible for their own votes.,205,,
856,0.97,6703.463,6710.57,"If they agree with the Federal monitor or agree with any other part of the political establishment, it is there decision.",205,,
857,0.97,6710.57,6716.209,I do not agree with the Federal monitor in my that will reflect that.,205,,
858,0.97,6716.209,6726.019,"If Councilmembers were serious, they would pass a budget that actually defines the police what would judge Roberts do?",205,,
859,0.97,6726.019,6727.32,Place an injunction on the city budget in response to that?,205,,
860,0.97,6727.32,6734.728,That is not a possible or realistic scenario.,205,,
861,0.97,6734.728,6744.137,"Instead we get letters from the Federal monitor expressing concerns and Councilmembers are pretending this concerns are legally binding, which they are not.",205,,
862,0.97,6744.137,6756.049,If Councilmembers were serious about Defunding the police they would not be increasing the police budget in the first place.,205,,
863,0.97,6756.049,6781.941,And the less committee discussion I quoted from my comments from the Council meeting on December 14 of last year when I was the only Councilmember to vote no on the bill to give--illegally spent on overtime they were not authorized to spend when they filled the streets with cops to abuse black lives matter protesters.,205,,
864,0.97,6781.941,6792.585,At this point I am quoting myself from past meetings.,205,,
865,0.97,6792.585,6793.219,This happens again and again.,205,,
866,0.97,6793.219,6801.795,At that time I said I am voting no--additional $5.4 million to fund the extra overtime they used abusing and Intimidating the black lives matter movement.,205,,
867,0.97,6801.795,6806.866,[Indiscernible] those are the funds we have available to do with what they want to do.,205,,
868,0.97,6806.866,6842.335,"Here we are in the last council meeting of the year, this is from December, the same year that we had an historic black lives matter movement--we now hear the police have spent 5.4 me dollars more than their budget, money that did not belong to them and are requesting retroactive permission for the Milliamps in taxpayer money they have stolen.",205,,
869,0.97,6842.335,6859.052,-- to fill the streets of Seattle with tear gas and other weapons and may have taken this for personal enrichment with individual officers amassing hundreds of thousands of dollars and over time P pay.,205,,
870,0.97,6859.052,6867.327,-- to the point where the Council even passed a resolution in the summer.,205,,
871,0.97,6867.327,6870.363,Pledging to say no if the police make this request at the end of the year.,205,,
872,0.97,6870.363,6872.465,Now is the test.,205,,
873,0.97,6872.465,6878.338,Will you hold the line?,205,,
874,0.97,6878.338,6892.051,Unfortunately in the Finance and housing committee last week--this is from last year--this year while pledging to take it from extras budget.,205,,
875,0.97,6892.051,6911.304,What did it mean at that time for Councilmembers to say--will the Council hold the line or push it back another year?,205,,
876,0.97,6911.304,6917.577,What if they go over by $20 million in the coming years?,205,,
877,0.97,6917.577,6924.517,We can see this is happening again and again.,205,,
878,0.97,6924.517,6934.394,"[Indiscernible] have demanded that the Council hold the line but at this point, is our points are already made in previous committees but they are needing to be met again.",205,,
879,0.97,6934.394,6942.201,This is not holding the line.,205,,
880,0.97,6942.201,6944.07,The line has been moved back with no guarantee that it will not move again and again.,205,,
881,0.97,6944.07,6954.447,There is everything to indicate that it will actually be moved back in favor of the police again and again.,205,,
882,0.97,6954.447,6962.956,"The reality is this is not about lines or promises or resolutions or goodwill, it is about the power of grassroots social movements on the streets.",205,,
883,0.97,6962.956,6984.043,"It was not a coincidence that at the height of tens of thousands being on the streets, that is when Democratic Consul members made promises . It is not a coincidence when the protest had reduced, the promises were reneged on.",205,,
884,0.97,6984.043,7000.993,"For less and for our movement is we must defend on her own strength . I think it is crucial for working people to get organized and fight for an elected community oversight board with full powers over the police including hiring and firing, subpoena powers and policies and procedures.",205,,
885,0.97,7000.993,7030.023,"My observation from having of talk to hundreds of people in a politically broad spectrum is that even the working people who are not sure about Defunding also strongly support an elected community oversight with full powers over the police . It is a demand that will not only help bring real accountability, but it is a step forward for our police accountability and it will unite working people.",205,,
886,0.97,7030.023,7034.927,Thank you.,205,,
887,0.97,7034.927,7038.197,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,206,,
888,0.97,7038.197,7055.047,Any other comments on the amendment? I have just a few words . There has been a lot of conversation about the role of the consent decree.,206,,
889,0.97,7055.047,7071.464,And reasonable people can disagree . But I think what is clear is that we do have a monitor and that monitors role is to monitor our compliance with the consent decree.,206,,
890,0.97,7071.464,7090.883,"And that monitor, when he wrote to us last week said in order to sustain compliance, the city is responsible for providing necessary support and resources to SPD in order to fulfill its obligations under the settlement agreement.",206,,
891,0.97,7090.883,7101.694,Now is the time to allocate resources to SPD at levels that will enable the city to close out a consent decree effectively and Sustainably.,206,,
892,0.97,7101.694,7139.031,"The Martyrs position seems to be that a $2 million budget cut in the context of this $360 million police Department budget, could somehow put SPD in the position of not being able to deliver key management and operational requirements . Even given that the version of the bill that the monitor reviewed included this lift of the $5 million proviso.",206,,
893,0.97,7139.031,7155.314,It is a lift of a $5 million proviso in a way that is scaled . that is why I am proposing to lift this additional $2.5 million proviso knowing that we cannot fulfill the objectives of the proviso.,206,,
894,0.97,7155.314,7168.528,Even though I am struggling to understand how the monitor can suggest that funding can solve SPD's training and patrol staffing challenges.,206,,
895,0.97,7168.528,7188.214,"These are the items that the monitor says that he is concerned about, relate to staffing and training and specifically that supervisors are being moved from training to fill patrol staffing challenges.",206,,
896,0.97,7188.214,7200.826,"These are all not problems that can be solved with dollars, they are problems that can be solved with additional staffing and the Council has fully funded the 2021 staffing plan.",206,,
897,0.97,7200.826,7219.412,"Nevertheless, I do feel that the monitors role in this instance is a role that must be considered by this Council . The monitor speaks to the court on a weekly, regular basis.",206,,
898,0.97,7219.412,7230.256,And I do not want to have the city be found to not be in compliance with the consent decree.,206,,
899,0.97,7230.256,7237.129,That is why I am reluctantly worrying for this additional proviso.,206,,
900,0.97,7237.129,7241.234,And seeing no further comments.,206,,
901,0.97,7241.234,7243.536,Will Bash,206,,
902,0.97,7243.536,7253.713,Sorry.,207,,
903,0.97,7254.38,7264.557,I wanted to add a little bit about the consent decree comments as well.,208,,
904,0.97,7264.557,7279.538,And I just want to say that the consent decree is a legal reality and it is a legal obligation for the city of Seattle.,208,,
905,0.97,7279.538,7301.694,"It is subject to a settlement agreement, which is a legally binding document on the city of Seattle as it relates to ongoing efforts to reform and make sure that this police Department continues to be and enhances its accountability in the area of police reform and misconduct.",208,,
906,0.97,7301.694,7324.016,That is a reality of the context and the environment in which we are being asked to make ongoing decisions within our charter mandated duties and responsibilities to also consider budget appropriations for each of the departments.,208,,
907,0.97,7324.016,7369.061,"But there is no question in the context of exercising our authority as budget appropriators in the city of Seattle, we have to in this context also exercise that obligation within the context of knowing that we are subject to a legally, binding document that requires us to consult with and be supervised by and ordered under threat of contempt of court orders, we have to make these decisions within that context . I wanted to emphasize that point you made.",208,,
908,0.97,7369.061,7379.972,"I do think it is getting lost in the debate and the discussion, both in the public and perhaps within our virtual chambers.",208,,
909,0.97,7379.972,7396.188,"I am concerned about this particular proviso, specifically because I think I have a slightly different reading of the Federal Court monitors Email to us . that came to us last week.",208,,
910,0.97,7396.188,7425.417,"I think that he continues to be concerned about any kind of budget reductions and while I disagree perhaps with his perspective that we should not be making any budget decisions at all, I still am concerned that lifting this $5 million proviso now, will create a disadvantage to us in the fall budget process.",208,,
911,0.97,7425.417,7447.339,"My preference on the $5 million proviso that I sponsored during the budget process, would be that we consider lifting it in the context of understanding sort of at the end of the year what the salary savings were.",208,,
912,0.97,7447.339,7456.649,And I think that also positions the city Council to identify how we would want to spend these unused dollars outside of the police Department.,208,,
913,0.97,7456.649,7465.758,My Recolletion is that is how we have done it in the past . in terms of the process and the timing.,208,,
914,0.97,7465.758,7477.636,"And for those reasons, I have concerns about the $5 million lifting of the $5 million proviso as part of amendment 1.",208,,
915,0.97,7477.636,7481.273,Thank you.,209,,
916,0.97,7481.273,7485.411,The lifting of the $5 million proviso is not in amendment 1.,209,,
917,0.97,7485.478,7487.079,T is in the base bill.,209,,
918,0.97,7487.079,7488.013,Right.,210,,
919,0.97,7488.013,7493.552,It is just about the proviso on the out of order layoffs.,211,,
920,0.97,7493.552,7496.789,Correct.,212,,
921,0.97,7496.789,7503.896,"On the out of order layoffs, now I am speaking to the underlying bill.",213,,
922,0.97,7503.896,7510.769,Sneak Peek.,213,,
923,0.97,7510.769,7528.587,"It is released to the out of order layoffs, I think it is really important to share with members of the viewing public that at the time that I was supportive of the out of order layoffs proviso, I truly believe we were going to be able to accomplish it.",213,,
924,0.97,7528.587,7546.305,"We had some indication within the public safety civil service rules that indicated that out of order layoffs were possible to achieve, if the chief of police would advocate to that body the desire and the wish to do so.",213,,
925,0.97,7546.305,7567.66,"Unfortunately, I feel like I have exhausted every Avenue possible to evaluate whether or not we could effectuate the intent behind the proviso and accomplish the goal of out of order layoffs.",213,,
926,0.97,7567.66,7633.592,"In that exercise, every single time I thought we found an answer and a way to do it, we would open up yet another Pandora's box, another layer built into our legal framework from decades before any of us were here struggling with these questions, that have effectively shielded and protected even those officers laid off for lying or bias policing or being convicted of a crime . Even if we were able to lay off those specific officers who have been found of significant misconduct in the past, even if we were able to lay those individuals off, the moment there was an opportunity to hire new officers back to the police force, those officers had the right of first refusal.",213,,
927,0.97,7633.592,7656.548,I think that effectively Frustrates our entire policy goal of focusing our efforts on out of order layoffs on those who frankly do not meet the high standards that we expect of those individuals who do serve as officers within the Seattle police Department.,213,,
928,0.97,7656.548,7667.526,"As a result, unfortunately, that means to me that we will not be able to effectuate the goal of out of order layoffs.",213,,
929,0.97,7667.526,7693.085,"That however should not be translated into saying that layoffs would or should never occur . It simply means that the concept of doing out of order layoffs in order to Prioritize identifying individuals cannot fulfill heir full functions as a police officer because of prior misconduct, is not achievable.",213,,
930,0.97,7693.085,7728.62,"I just want to make sure that folks understand that does not mean layoffs cannot occur, the proviso is really about how layoffs might occur . I think we have run the course of the evaluation and realizing that the out of order mechanism for achieving any layoffs is not feasible nor will it fulfill the original policy goals that we are Fueling the support of that proviso.",213,,
931,0.97,7728.62,7728.987,Thank you.,214,,
932,0.97,7728.987,7745.637,In addition to our public safety civil service Commission rules there is actually a prohibition that we discovered earlier this year in state law passed in 2018 for taking any adverse action against an officer that is on the Brady list.,214,,
933,0.97,7745.637,7761.854,"I myself, there is some Brady list related bills in the state Legislature this year and I testified to have that language changed and that is not one of the reforms that moved forward.",214,,
934,0.97,7761.854,7762.321,Councilmember Lewis.,214,,
935,0.97,7762.321,7766.125,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,215,,
936,0.97,7766.125,7791.517,"I similarly wanted to as someone who went on that similar journey with some of the other members of this Committee and looking into the out of order layoffs for people, officers on the Brady list, just to dovetail on your last comment, Councilmember Herbold.",215,,
937,0.97,7791.517,7802.261,This is a prime issue for interim to work with our legislative delegation in the run up to the next session to really put an emphasis on this.,215,,
938,0.97,7802.261,7804.563,We kind of found these revelations of some of the issues in the state law a little later in the session.,215,,
939,0.97,7804.563,7812.805,I think with the run up to the next one this is a really prime area to work together with our partners inside and outside city hall through this really critical reform.,215,,
940,0.97,7812.805,7839.832,I think it is unbelievably counter to the public policy interest that officers on the Brady list are so insulated and protected from this kind of accountability . It was really discouraging to see that and the solution to that sits in some essential changes to state law and I look forward to those conversations to crap those policies and fight for them in the next session.,215,,
941,0.97,7839.832,7841.833,Thank you.,216,,
942,0.97,7841.833,7848.34,Any other comments? all right.,216,,
943,0.97,7848.34,7850.309,Seeing none.,216,,
944,0.97,7850.309,7851.844,"The clerk, please call role.",216,,
945,0.97,7851.844,7857.349,This is for amendment 1.,217,,
946,0.97,7857.349,7860.452,Councilmember Gonzalez.,217,,

952,0.97,7869.862,7871.463,Councilmember Herbold.,217,,
953,0.97,7871.463,7873.232,Yes.,217,,
954,0.97,7873.232,7878.804,Thank you.,218,,
955,0.97,7878.804,7883.709,Next we will move into the underlying bill and move Council bill 1199 81 as amended.,218,,
956,0.97,7883.709,7889.381,Is there a second?,218,,
957,0.97,7889.381,7895.287,Second.,219,,
958,0.97,7895.287,7895.687,Thank you.,220,,
959,0.97,7895.687,7904.696,Any discussion of the amended version of Council bill 1199 81.,220,,
960,0.97,7904.696,7906.598,Councilmember Morales.,220,,
961,0.97,7906.598,7920.579,"This is been a frustrating process, I will say.",221,,
962,0.97,7920.579,7932.691,We are all feeling a little frustrated by the things we are learning along the way as we tried to hold ourselves accountable to the changes that we want to make on behalf of community . the way the police Department works in the way the city funds the Department.,221,,
963,0.97,7932.691,7945.304,"I want to say that I would support this bill, if it was still following the original intent, which was to enforce budget accountability for SPD.",221,,
964,0.97,7945.304,7956.014,But this amendment does not just change--this new bill does not change the bill it reverses the impact of what we attended and I cannot support it.,221,,
965,0.97,7956.014,7963.555,I think we need to reinstate the proviso on the $5 million in future savings.,221,,
966,0.97,7963.555,7978.737,And I am sort of in the same boat with Councilmember Sawant and not being able to move that forward.,221,,
967,0.97,7978.737,7990.148,I think it is important to note that SPD has already acknowledged themselves that they could absorb the $5.4 million reduction through their salary savings . and the recent request is mostly for new items that were not identified in the previous requests.,221,,
968,0.97,7990.148,7998.59,"If they find later in the year or early next year that they have additional needs, they could come back to Council and request those funds . There is no reason to provide this now.",221,,
969,0.97,7998.59,8016.007,"Only item in the list provided, they are legally obligated to pay is the separation pay at $1.8 million . again, salary savings anticipated for this year could cover that amount.",221,,
970,0.97,8016.007,8025.317,There is $2.8 million for new technologies including early intervention system.,221,,
971,0.97,8025.317,8031.523,Which by the way SPD has been funded for already for the last 10 years and that is not done anything to improve use of force violations in the Department.,221,,
972,0.97,8031.523,8041.833,"In fact, the Department requires for an officer to have six different incidents before they are even assessed into the program.",221,,
973,0.97,8041.833,8047.105,It does not do anything to prevent use of force violations.,221,,
974,0.97,8047.105,8056.381,"In 2015, the city audit of SPD public disclosure found serious issues with the Department.",221,,
975,0.97,8056.381,8059.618,They were not keeping track of information.,221,,
976,0.97,8059.618,8074.866,The report made several recommendations to the Department as far as we know the Department has taken no action on those and in fact in the last six years there have not been any real improvements made to that.,221,,
977,0.97,8074.866,8086.144,I think the recent news that the text of the former chief has gone missing is another indication that the Department is not serious about fulfilling this obligation.,221,,
978,0.97,8086.144,8090.315,We also know there is a history of unchecked abuse of every time.,221,,
979,0.97,8090.315,8101.693,2016 auditor's report found they had significant gaps in controls and they were not collecting data about overtime and they did not review the totals of overtime either.,221,,
980,0.97,8101.693,8102.861,Since then the Department is made very few changes.,221,,
981,0.97,8102.861,8114.172,"There is just a pattern of even with the Department is audited and recommendations are made of how to approve accountability, those recommendations are not being followed.",221,,
982,0.97,8114.172,8129.387,Spd is choosing to Prioritize their transfer of 100 officers out of specialty units into the community response group.,221,,
983,0.97,8129.387,8138.33,That is what has resulted in fewer staffing and a specialty units and it is easily remedied by moving the officers back to their unit . The department claims that 911 response time is a priority about these officers don't respond to 911.,221,,
984,0.97,8138.33,8142.534,They respond to protests.,221,,
985,0.97,8142.534,8152.444,"Even when they are counted as 911 responders as was reported in the March 9 presentation to this Committee, the response time is actually no different.",221,,
986,0.97,8152.444,8161.253,"The department has the officers it needs, where they choose to deploy them is up to the Department obviously.",221,,
987,0.97,8161.253,8169.361,But they can't use that as an excuse to say they need additional funding for the staffing issues.,221,,
988,0.97,8169.361,8181.873,"This is a funding crisis of the Department so making . They decided to Overspend on overtime last summer, giving more funding will not prevent crime . It will not address the homelessness issue in our city.",221,,
989,0.97,8181.873,8182.741,It will not reduce substance abuse.,221,,
990,0.97,8182.741,8189.414,It will not improve mental health outcomes for committee members.,221,,
991,0.97,8189.414,8194.886,Only investing in community services and solutions will do that.,221,,
992,0.97,8194.886,8195.987,And that is what community has been asking for.,221,,
993,0.97,8195.987,8210.201,"A shift in the way we allocate our public dollars . Our goal should be investing in a way that changes community conditions, lead to better health and better well-being and rewarding SPD for overspending outside of his budget authority will not encompass that.",221,,
994,0.97,8210.201,8216.675,I will be voting no on this bill.,221,,
995,0.97,8216.675,8229.02,Thank you Councilmember Morales . any other comments or thoughts? I am not seeing any raised hands.,222,,
996,0.97,8229.02,8237.295,Thank you so much Councilmember Herbold.,223,,
997,0.97,8237.295,8241.433,This bill has been really difficult and challenging to deal with.,223,,
998,0.97,8241.433,8254.713,I appreciate the position you are in and I appreciate that you are working towards developing a thoughtful threading of the needle here.,223,,
999,0.97,8254.713,8257.749,To allow us to move forward on this.,223,,
1000,0.97,8257.749,8271.263,"Unfortunately, for different reasons than have already been stated by my colleagues on this Committee, also plan to vote no on this bill.",223,,
1001,0.97,8271.263,8274.933,"Again, for slightly different reasons.",223,,
1002,0.97,8274.933,8314.406,"That will lead to my position to not ultimately support passing this bill . It had been my hope that over the last several months that we would be able to come to some consensus with the Department, with Stakeholders, with the Mayor's office, as it relates to the $5.4 million proposal . I know at the end of the year the position on the executive side was to oppose it and not be supportive of the bill.",223,,
1003,0.97,8314.406,8320.211,I think positions have sadly only further entrenched since we have first introduced this bill at the end of the year.,223,,
1004,0.97,8320.211,8335.794,"At this point, I feel like we have a proposed piece of legislation before us that everyone, for their own reasons, unhappy with.",223,,
1005,0.97,8335.794,8374.065,I think that Unfortunately that leaves me in a position to not be able to support this bill for that reason . but also because I think that the Council would be better served waiting until later in the year to take action related to these proposed cuts and to the proposals related to lifting of my $5 million proviso . We know the executive is going to be back before the Council pretty soon in September with proposed budget changes to the Seattle police Department's budget.,223,,
1006,0.97,8374.065,8390.081,"This could take the form of grant acceptances, special events, cost in staffing and overtime cost, separation pay, paid family medical leave reimbursements, the list probably goes on.",223,,
1007,0.97,8390.081,8413.071,"I think these are issues that need to be addressed, certainly through a Pre-Suplemental ordinance but then we will also have another opportunity to consider SPD's full Holistic budget during the fall budget process.",223,,
1008,0.97,8413.071,8416.741,"And I think right now what is missing for me is that we don't know in which direction, whether an increase or decrease in the budget that these actions will lead to take.",223,,
1009,0.97,8416.741,8444.836,Months from now the Council I think will have much more flexibility and much more accurate information about how to find some real precision around the budget and actions that might be necessary in order to thread the needle in a way that may be more satisfactory to those who we are hearing from.,223,,
1010,0.97,8444.836,8466.324,I am Unfortunately not going to be able to support the bill today . But I understand that we have exhausted our debate process in committee.,223,,
1011,0.97,8466.324,8470.328,"And would support moving forward on this bill with a vote today, even if it is a divided report with the recommendation not to pass.",223,,
1012,0.97,8470.328,8483.475,"I still think Councilmember Herbold, you have run the course and your Committee work sessions on this bill.",223,,
1013,0.97,8483.475,8502.594,"And if that is how the boat and is up, then the full council will have the committee's recommendation one way or the other . and we can be prepared to move forward on this budget issue in full council as needed.",223,,
1014,0.97,8502.594,8503.061,Thank you.,224,,
1015,0.97,8503.061,8518.977,"Before I move to Councilmember Lewis, I do want to ask what I hope is a clarifying question.",224,,
1016,0.97,8518.977,8565.823,"Given your comments about the seriousness of the role of the monitor to basically supervise the city as it relates to obligations under the consent decree, are you not concerned that continuing to tie up $7.5 million in budget authority will not draw the supervision of the monitor . We are not just hearing, don't cut the police Department's budget from the monitor.",224,,
1017,0.97,8565.823,8571.296,We are also hearing from SPD that they are seeking that additional flexibility associated with lifting the Provisos.,224,,
1018,0.97,8571.296,8604.495,"And that is the spirit in which I thought we voted in the last committee meeting for the substitute which included the lifting of the $5 million proviso as well as today's amendment, was out of concerned that the monitor would flag for the judge the fact that we are holding $7.5 million that the police Department cannot access.",224,,
1019,0.97,8604.495,8611.302,I appreciate the question.,225,,
1020,0.97,8611.302,8614.672,I do think functionally there is a difference between a proviso and a budget cut.,225,,
1021,0.97,8614.672,8635.093,Proviso does sort of restrict the spending of the dollars but doesn't categorically reduce the budget further for the Department.,225,,
1022,0.97,8635.994,8644.702,"My reading of the communications I have seen from chief Diaz to the monitor has indicated that this bill, as amended, is too restrictive.",225,,
1023,0.97,8644.702,8648.706,And does not actually fulfill its ability.,225,,
1024,0.97,8648.706,8664.622,I think Unfortunately that the Federal Court police monitor based on my reading of his communications agrees with that perspective is expressed by SPD.,225,,
1025,0.97,8664.622,8690.381,"I am not sure--I think we want to have that flexibility in order to fulfill the intent of the consent decree and the obligations of the consent decree, but I don't think that the court or the Federal police monitor will agree with our perspective that this bill accomplishes that flexibility goal.",225,,
1026,0.97,8690.381,8715.073,"For that reason, I think being in a status quo position of where we ended last year, which did include the proviso, is kind of eight no file, no harm position as it relates to our relationship with the consent decree.",225,,
1027,0.97,8715.073,8718.109,Councilmember Lewis.,226,,
1028,0.97,8718.109,8720.812,This is a question for Greg.,227,,
1029,0.97,8720.812,8725.583,But I think Councilmember Gonzalez just Answere it.,227,,
1030,0.97,8725.583,8758.216,"Effectively, were this bill to be ultimately not passed at full council . Even if it comes out on a divided minority voting in favor of it, and it went to full Council and did not pass . We would essentially be back to where we were with the budget we passed in November, with everything unaltered, is essentially what the outcome would be of not passing anything.",227,,
1031,0.97,8758.216,8766.724,But I see Councilmember Herbold nodding.,227,,
1032,0.97,8766.724,8767.959,I just throw that over to Greg to clarify.,227,,
1033,0.97,8767.959,8768.226,Yes.,228,,
1034,0.97,8768.226,8784.142,That is correct . There would be continued restrictions on the salary savings of $5 million and there would be continued restrictions on the out of order layoffs of 2.5 may dollars.,228,,
1035,0.97,8784.142,8789.28,They would also not be the additional $2 million for Participatory budgeting.,229,,
1036,0.97,8789.28,8793.751,That we indicate in this bill.,229,,
1037,0.97,8793.751,8793.985,Yes.,230,,
1038,0.97,8793.985,8795.686,Just wanted to clarify that.,231,,
1039,0.97,8795.686,8805.263,We could pull out the $2.5 million proviso for the out of order layoffs and run that is a separate bill?,232,,
1040,0.97,8805.263,8814.105,That is absolutely the Council's Purview to do so.,233,,
1041,0.97,8814.105,8819.21,But not today.,234,,
1042,0.97,8819.21,8821.913,All right.,234,,
1043,0.97,8821.913,8827.585,Thank you.,234,,
1044,0.97,8827.585,8832.59,We have exhausted debate on this bill.,234,,
1045,0.97,8832.59,8835.126,That was introduced back in December.,234,,
1046,0.97,8835.126,8846.704,"With that, I am going to ask the clerk to call role.",234,,
1047,0.97,8846.704,8847.738,Councilmember Gonzalez.,235,,
1048,0.97,8847.738,8849.44,No.,235,,
1049,0.97,8849.44,8853.411,Councilmember Lewis.,235,,
1050,0.97,8853.411,8853.611,Yes.,235,,
1051,0.97,8853.611,8854.111,Councilmember Morales.,235,,

1057,0.97,8866.123,8866.624,Thank you so much.,236,,
1058,0.97,8866.624,8871.929,They vote is 2-3 against.,236,,
1059,0.97,8871.929,8881.138,The recommendation will not pass the bill the recommendation with a divided report will be sent to the full city council.,236,,
1060,0.97,8881.138,8885.476,Under the Council roles the legislation will not go to the immediate full council meeting until the following Monday.,236,,
1061,0.97,8885.476,8892.25,And that will be may 24.,236,,
1062,0.97,8892.25,8907.265,"With that, the next public safety and human services committee is scheduled for May 25. before we adjourn are there any other comments? seeing none.",236,,
