46,0.97,285.418,288.288,I'm Michael Ruby.,12,,
47,0.97,288.288,290.49,I'm speaking regarding the carbon note.,12,,
48,0.97,290.49,295.295,I've been doing professional modeling of atmospheric gases for the past 50 years.,12,,
49,0.97,295.295,305.104,"For decades, I've been warning that we will see the very Climatic catastrophes that we are witnessing this week in Washington, Oregon, and California.",12,,
50,0.97,305.104,307.307,I've worked for industries to help reduce pollution.,12,,
51,0.97,307.307,310.31,And I have worked for good carbon emissions legislation.,12,,
52,0.97,310.31,315.314,But we're heading in the wrong direction.,12,,
53,0.97,315.314,317.216,We're increasing not decreasing emissions in Seattle.,12,,
54,0.97,317.216,332.031,"This carbon NOTE will provide you with information to help you calculate whether proposals you vote on will increase, decrease or have no effect on our carbon emissions.",12,,
55,0.97,332.031,336.436,This simple report will have an immediate beneficial effect.,12,,
56,0.97,336.436,350.049,"When a project from utilities parks or fires totaled by parks or staff, I'm going to have to put an adverse carbon NOTE on this, there will be a mad scramble to readjust their proposal.",12,,
57,0.97,350.049,355.521,"This will mean a revised proposal with less carbon emissions, and you will have an easier time voting yes.",12,,
58,0.97,355.521,361.561,My neighbors and your constituents do not want to hear that you have approved a city project based on a wish and a prayer.,12,,
59,0.97,361.561,368.034,They want to know that you had the information and carefully considered the climate consequences of your actions that.,12,,
60,0.97,368.034,371.938,"We are moving in the right direction, finally Reducin our carbon emissions.",12,,
61,0.97,371.938,376.442,I want to suggest one change that I feel will improve your results.,12,,
62,0.97,376.442,388.888,I sent you in an E-mail an edited version of attachment B that includes a phrase that makes it clear that the evaluation should include consideration of embodied carbon.,12,,
63,0.97,388.888,392.592,This is an important consideration.,12,,
64,0.97,392.592,397.497,An example construction projects embodied carbon was found to be equal to 20 years of operational carbon emissions.,12,,
65,0.97,397.497,399.766,I urge you to adopt this with the change I have provided.,12,,
66,0.97,399.766,402.301,Thank you.,12,,
67,0.97,402.301,405.972,"Thank you, Michael for calling in today.",13,,

70,0.97,413.212,418.284,"Next up is Kathy Tuttle, followed by Jim street.",13,,
71,0.97,418.284,420.119,And Megna Shankar.,13,,
72,0.97,423.856,426.993,"Good afternoon, Council members.",14,,
73,0.97,426.993,430.53,I'm Kathy Tuttle.,14,,
74,0.97,430.53,432.331,Also speaking to resolution 31933.,14,,
75,0.97,432.331,439.305,Today's smoke-filled air is a reminder that we're just at the beginning of a climate emergency that's going to last for the rest of our lives.,14,,
76,0.97,439.305,442.041,And the lives of our children's children.,14,,
77,0.97,442.041,451.083,Today you can help transform Seattle into a city that thrives in the future.,14,,
78,0.97,451.083,458.558,"If you take a vote to support the legislation, you do so understanding the economic impacts of your vote.",14,,
79,0.97,458.558,464.664,And you've started to evaluate where your votes increase or decrease Antiracist policies.,14,,
80,0.97,464.664,470.036,Economic impacts and Racive policy impacts before the vote allows you to make better decisions.,14,,
81,0.97,470.036,478.277,"This carbon NOTE will give you more information and confidence that the votes you take will increase carbon, increasing carbon or have no impact.",14,,
82,0.97,478.277,487.954,"Just as every decision you make now should have financial impact, Antiracism impacts, every decision should consider climate impacts.",14,,
83,0.97,487.954,498.197,The carbon notes asks you to direct your attention to whether you're agreeing to finance projects that will increase or decrease carbon gases.,14,,
84,0.97,498.197,501.601,This bill is very small and very imperfect right now.,14,,
85,0.97,501.601,507.807,"Just as with considerations of Antiracism and policy, we're going to need to refine and refine our understanding over time.",14,,
86,0.97,507.807,512.311,This is a small step that focuses the city's attention on carbon impacts of its decisions.,14,,
87,0.97,512.311,518.985,"I encourage you to vote to approval resolution 31933, the carbon note.",14,,
88,0.97,518.985,520.519,Thank you.,14,,
89,0.97,520.519,524.924,"Thank you, Kathy for calling in.",15,,
90,0.97,524.924,533.666,Next up is Jim street.,15,,
91,0.97,533.966,538.771,"Jim if you're with us, hit Star-6 so we can hear you.",15,,
92,0.97,542.675,543.743,Can you hear me now?,16,,
93,0.97,543.743,546.312,"We can hear you, go ahead.",17,,
94,0.97,546.312,548.314,My name is Jim street.,18,,
95,0.97,548.314,551.951,And I'm here to speak on the carbon NOTE resolution as well.,18,,
96,0.97,551.951,562.562,First I'd like to say that the job you have today is much tougher than the job I had when I served on the Council 25 years ago.,18,,
97,0.97,562.562,564.397,Challenges from multiple directions are unprecedented.,18,,
98,0.97,564.397,575.374,"However, right now, with those challenges we phrase, we, our children, and our grand children still face an existential threat from climate change.",18,,
99,0.97,575.374,582.848,"Seattle needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 53% or 100% by 2030, depending on which goal statement you check.",18,,
100,0.97,582.848,585.384,We are not on track on either goal.,18,,
101,0.97,585.384,587.019,We are losing ground.,18,,
102,0.97,587.019,589.055,Not make progress.,18,,
103,0.97,589.055,596.629,Every member of the Council has expressed deep concerns about global warming.,18,,
104,0.97,596.629,610.977,And the Council's 2019 green resolution was an excellent and ambitious decoration of intent.,18,,
105,0.97,610.977,620.286,But the focus has slipped and I wonder if the Council knows when those dates will be reestablished.,18,,
106,0.97,620.286,623.689,You're leadership is essential if we're going to have a chance on climate in Seattle.,18,,
107,0.97,623.689,630.896,Council members need to have the information to make good decisions.,18,,
108,0.97,630.896,632.131,So do we as citizens.,18,,
109,0.97,632.131,633.165,City Council and executive staff.,18,,
110,0.97,633.165,642.108,"The carbon note, in addition to the information that it provides, like the creation of a select committee.",18,,
111,0.97,642.108,652.985,It Recenters or centers the issue of climate Change.14 to show where your priorities are and where the community's priorities should be.,18,,
112,0.97,652.985,654.353,Thank you very much.,18,,
113,0.97,654.353,657.59,Thank you for calling in today.,19,,

115,0.97,666.565,669.969,"Hello, Council members.",20,,
116,0.97,669.969,673.472,I am also addressing resolution 31933.,20,,
117,0.97,673.472,680.479,"I am a Second-Year at Udub, and an Organizer with the Youth-Led organization, fighting for future Seattle.",20,,
118,0.97,680.479,705.805,"And my fellow protestors and me are outside the city hall every Friday, before the pandemic, sacrificing time at school to urge the Mayor and you to take aggressive action against climate change.",20,,
119,0.97,705.805,707.006,I support this resolution.,20,,
120,0.97,707.006,717.716,Requiring climate impact by the agent of the proposed legislation and ensures that all departments Prioritize policy that would decrease Seattle's climate impact in.,20,,
121,0.97,717.716,732.331,"Resolution 31895, or Seattle's Graen new deal, the Mayor and city council acknowledged the U.N. report's conclusion that humans have only until 2030 to reduce our emissions to avoid massive devastation due to climate change.",20,,
122,0.97,732.331,738.504,Seattle's green new deal presents very admirable goals to improve the economy.,20,,
123,0.97,738.504,743.509,Help black and indigenous people of color and combat ca emissions.,20,,
124,0.97,743.509,751.851,"But without further legislation to put these into action, it is just empty words to appease the people.",20,,
125,0.97,751.851,758.557,The resolution is just one step in the many it will take to actually achieve the ambitious goals set in the green new deal.,20,,
126,0.97,758.557,767.833,It requires the city and its people to account for the climate impact of every budget item.,20,,
127,0.97,767.833,772.972,Which will hopefully encourage policies that actively reduce our city's emissions.,20,,
128,0.97,772.972,776.609,This is why I urge all Council members to vote yes on this important resolution.,20,,
129,0.97,776.609,776.909,Thank you.,20,,
130,0.97,776.909,779.945,Thank you for calling in today and for your advocacy.,21,,

139,0.97,802.501,818.083,"The Wildfire smoke that is choking our city and the entire West Coast is a reminder that in a year full of crises, the global climate crisis continues to pose an existential threat to our society and way of life.",22,,
140,0.97,818.083,818.817,We need action.,22,,
141,0.97,818.817,824.99,Cities like Seattle can take the lead in cut emissions.,22,,
142,0.97,824.99,837.036,We support adding a carbon NOTE proposed to the legislation because we think this can help to encourage you as elected officials and the public to make a habit of always thinking about climate impacts in the process.,22,,
143,0.97,837.036,838.604,Designing new programs and policies.,22,,
144,0.97,838.604,844.977,This is important so the work of Decarbonizing our city is not lost.,22,,
145,0.97,844.977,849.381,More attention should be paid to the expected carbon impact of households and their travel patterns.,22,,
146,0.97,849.381,855.921,The same is true when we think of investments in our city's transportation infrastructure.,22,,
147,0.97,855.921,861.961,Thank you to Council member Pedersen for bringing forward this idea and responding to it for feedback.,22,,
148,0.97,861.961,864.33,We support this resolution and hope this committee will too.,22,,

183,0.97,1025.424,1029.928,We must all be sensitive to those affected by loss of life on this day.,30,,
184,0.97,1029.928,1033.799,There are many survivors with trauma focused around this date.,30,,
185,0.97,1033.799,1037.002,I believe government control over people needs to be restricted and not expanded.,30,,
186,0.97,1037.002,1045.577,This is a time some think is the beginning of a revolution or the crescendo of a cold war coupled with climate emergency.,30,,
187,0.97,1045.577,1052.484,I think the Seattle city council must understand the context in which they are making decisions.,30,,
188,0.97,1052.484,1055.988,Expanding laws and government facilities before this number's election is reckless.,30,,
189,0.97,1055.988,1057.456,It puts citizens under more control and surveillance.,30,,
190,0.97,1057.456,1064.663,Thank you.,30,,
191,0.97,1064.663,1068.634,Thank you for calling in today.,31,,
192,0.97,1068.634,1077.009,That appears to be the last Speaker.,31,,

203,0.97,1150.949,1151.55,Good to see you again.,32,,
204,0.97,1151.55,1155.053,And thank you very much for having us.,32,,
205,0.97,1155.053,1164.663,"I'd like to introduce K-12 and Postsecondary director, Dana Harrison, who is here with me today.",32,,
206,0.97,1164.663,1167.866,And our early learning director was not able to join us today.,32,,
207,0.97,1167.866,1172.971,So I will be speaking to our early learning funding processes.,32,,
208,0.97,1172.971,1177.743,"And should you have any specific questions, my team will follow up with our responses.",32,,
209,0.97,1177.743,1187.286,And I know it's been quite sometime since we've presented to Council.,32,,
210,0.97,1187.286,1194.493,So we're happy to updated you on our Fu processes.,32,,
211,0.97,1194.493,1208.574,"Before we dive in and since it's been a while since I've briefed you, I really wanted to just quickly ground you in, or ground us in the Department's work.",32,,
212,0.97,1208.574,1210.509,These focus on four key results.,32,,
213,0.97,1210.509,1224.423,"To ensure that all children and young adults in Seattle, especially those from educational justice, are Kindergarten-Ready, graduating high school on time, college and Career-Ready.",32,,
214,0.97,1224.423,1234.066,And that they access and complete a Postsecondary education.,32,,
215,0.97,1234.066,1235.133,And these results drive investments.,32,,
216,0.97,1235.133,1235.701,And this is our why.,32,,
217,0.97,1235.701,1241.74,"You can go to the next slide, please.",32,,
218,0.97,1241.74,1253.151,We center our actions and approach our investments and service delivery around these four values seen here on the screen.,32,,
219,0.97,1253.151,1263.061,"You can go to the next one, bee.",32,,
220,0.97,1263.061,1269.167,"So Finally, all these deals and investments are aligned with three core strategies.",32,,
221,0.97,1269.167,1279.578,One is ensuring access to equitable education opportunities through investments such subsidies and facility development.,32,,
222,0.97,1279.578,1285.183,Providing student and family support such as our health services.,32,,
223,0.97,1285.183,1296.194,"And delivering services in high-quality learning environments, which we support through robust professional development through our providers and education.",32,,
224,0.97,1296.194,1297.496,Diversity and Encouragemently responsive practices.,32,,
225,0.97,1297.496,1315.747,"Before I move to the next slide, I want to provide some reminders about our staff.",32,,
226,0.97,1318.784,1319.484,Culturally responsive practices.,32,,
227,0.97,1319.484,1321.253,"Before I move to the next slide, I want to provide some reminders about our staff.",32,,
228,0.97,1321.253,1339.705,"The first year of the second investments, this past school year, 2019/20 was a transition year for us.",32,,
229,0.97,1351.216,1353.352,And funding priorities.,32,,
230,0.97,1353.352,1362.961,And 2 so they all had time to facilitate intentional and equitable funding process.,32,,
231,0.97,1362.961,1363.261,Processes.,32,,
232,0.97,1363.261,1371.636,"And under Fep, our diameter has introduced some new approaches to how we competitively bid funds, which I'd like to highlight for you.",32,,
233,0.97,1371.636,1381.78,The first is that we make sure that all of our funding review panels included community representation from parents to young people.,32,,
234,0.97,1381.78,1390.255,And that those community representatives received a paid Stipend for their time spent reading and scoring applications.,32,,
235,0.97,1390.255,1402.2,And second we made sure that all information sessions for deal funding processes were both offered in person and Online.,32,,
236,0.97,1402.2,1409.474,"And whenever possible, we included oral interviews as part of our funding decision process.",32,,
237,0.97,1409.474,1412.01,Such as for our recent K12 funding opportunities.,32,,
238,0.97,1412.01,1427.292,"Because we knew from feedback that we had received from many of our culturally diverse partners, that written applications don't always adequately capture a program's strength.",32,,
239,0.97,1427.359,1431.53,"Ext slide, please.",32,,
240,0.97,1434.533,1442.641,So what you see here is a Snapshot of our completed funding processes.,33,,
241,0.97,1442.641,1449.014,I'll provide a quick overview of these investments and speak briefly about our early learning processes.,33,,
242,0.97,1449.014,1459.991,"Before passing it off to my colleague, Dana, to speak to the K-12 and Postsecondary division, which comprised the majority of the funding opportunities.",33,,
243,0.97,1459.991,1465.864,So we are excited about all of the investments you see here.,33,,
244,0.97,1465.864,1467.265,In the early learning sphere.,33,,
245,0.97,1467.265,1469.568,Our amazing Seattle preschool program just completed five years.,33,,
246,0.97,1469.568,1479.144,Or should I say the fifth years.,33,,
247,0.97,1479.144,1486.251,The 2020/21 school year marks our sixth year as a program.,33,,
248,0.97,1486.251,1490.255,Sdp will grow annually with funding provided for more classrooms.,33,,
249,0.97,1490.255,1495.894,As well as facilities funding that will increase existing Proirsd' capacity.,33,,
250,0.97,1495.894,1507.272,"Under our K-12 and health umbrella, in early twenty 19, we ran a funding process for design implementation of new homeless and housing support investments.",33,,
251,0.97,1507.272,1509.007,This is a three-year award.,33,,
252,0.97,1509.007,1514.913,And we will run the process again in 2022.,33,,
253,0.97,1514.913,1517.315,To finish out the levy term.,33,,
254,0.97,1517.315,1523.421,We've also completed funding processes for new Fep School-Based investments.,33,,
255,0.97,1523.421,1528.426,And those are six-year investments set set to begin this fall.,33,,
256,0.97,1528.426,1533.131,Our new opportunity and access investments were just announced a few weeks ago.,33,,
257,0.97,1533.131,1548.613,"The opportunity and access awards are for three-year terms, and will be Rebid in 2023 for a second Third-Year cycle before the levy term ends.",33,,
258,0.97,1548.613,1554.352,The levy also made possible the expansion of the School-Based health centers to four additional schools.,33,,
259,0.97,1554.352,1558.823,Two middle middle and 22 high schools.,33,,
260,0.97,1558.823,1561.493,This is really exciting.,33,,
261,0.97,1561.493,1567.065,"And it means everything comprehensive, middle and high schools.",33,,
262,0.97,1567.065,1570.835,And Seattle public schools has a health center Onsite.,33,,
263,0.97,1570.835,1585.083,And the Rebid of the funding for elementary school based health clinics just wrapped up in early July and will support School-Based health services in eight of the SPs elementary schools.,33,,
264,0.97,1585.083,1590.388,"Director, Chapelle, this particular--I know we're gonNA get into more granular detail here.",34,,
265,0.97,1590.388,1607.505,"But just as a reminder, when we're talking about some of the funding processes, and awards, it would be helpful to know particularly as it relates to School-Based investments, opportunity and access, School-Based health centers.",34,,
266,0.97,1607.505,1616.581,"How those investments are being impacted, if at all, by the ongoing realities of Covid-19.",34,,
267,0.97,1616.581,1626.358,And the remote learning situation that many of our students find themselves in.,34,,
268,0.97,1626.358,1630.028,"And it's probably true for just about all of these areas, I'd say.",34,,
269,0.97,1630.028,1637.402,"But as we go through the slides, if you can add a comment with that.",34,,
270,0.97,1637.402,1637.902,About that.,34,,
271,0.97,1637.902,1644.142,I think that is probably something that is at the top of the list of most of us in the committee today.,34,,
272,0.97,1644.142,1645.744,Thank you.,34,,
273,0.97,1645.744,1646.011,Okay.,35,,

275,0.97,1653.551,1654.052,"Okay, next line.",35,,
276,0.97,1654.052,1655.854,I just lost my screen.,35,,
277,0.97,1661.66,1665.03,There we go.,36,,
278,0.97,1665.03,1674.873,"So we're excited to welcome new agencies, and nine new classrooms to our family.",36,,

280,0.97,1683.481,1687.485,"Hearing, speech, and Deafness center adds one new classroom.",36,,

285,0.97,1719.284,1725.723,We expect this same rate of growth to remain steady throughout the life of the levy.,36,,
286,0.97,1725.723,1732.397,Adding roughly ten classrooms or 250 kids per year.,36,,
287,0.97,1732.397,1739.437,"For facilities funding, the last round of funding was announced October, 2019.",36,,
288,0.97,1739.437,1748.947,"So voices of tomorrow received an award that will allow them to renovate and expand classrooms, Restrooms, kitchen space.",36,,
289,0.97,1748.947,1752.817,As well as construct an outdoor play area.,36,,

295,0.97,1813.111,1813.878,Council members.,37,,
296,0.97,1813.878,1816.414,I'm gonNA speak just a little bit about the process here.,37,,
297,0.97,1816.414,1826.591,"And then to get to your question, Council President, we'll certainly address the impacts of the Covid situation and the Remoted learning environment this fall.",37,,
298,0.97,1826.591,1835.7,"So first, just to share a little bit about the funding process as Dwayne said it, kicked off in the fall of 2019.",37,,
299,0.97,1835.7,1842.307,These investments provide supplemental funding for expanded learning and academic support.,37,,
300,0.97,1842.307,1845.009,As well as College-Readiness experiences.,37,,
301,0.97,1845.009,1850.448,For the purpose of assuring that students graduate from high school prepared for what comes next in that Pathway.,37,,
302,0.97,1850.448,1867.699,Schools submitted their proposals to provide these services in their context.,37,,
303,0.97,1882.046,1884.883,Of the funding and the desired impact was clear.,37,,
304,0.97,1884.883,1890.288,And also that we were supporting schools and submitting s applications.,37,,
305,0.97,1890.288,1904.769,"All the applications that we received go through technical compliance review and are evaluated by a community review panel, which Dwayne alluded to earlier.",37,,
306,0.97,1904.769,1922.32,"These panels are comprised of city staff and others who have backgrounds in work insurance, education, development, Snush partners that are representative of government, nonprofit as well as higher education and the city of Seattle boards and Commission.",37,,
307,0.97,1922.32,1923.721,Including the oversight committee.,37,,
308,0.97,1923.721,1928.126,About 70% of the panelists we have for this process identified as people of color.,37,,
309,0.97,1928.126,1936.401,And all participated in orientation that included a racial equity and Antibias training.,37,,
310,0.97,1936.401,1954.519,So we're incredibly excited to work with these schools and have been doing so since the spring.,37,,
311,0.97,1957.722,1962.66,Let me show you one more slide and I'll get to the Covid impacts here.,37,,
312,0.97,1962.66,1964.662,Thank you.,37,,
313,0.97,1964.662,1972.136,What you see is a representation of where these schools fall across our city.,37,,
314,0.97,1972.136,1982.814,And it looks like the top of your slide might be cut a little bit on district 5. we have two additional schools that are up there on the North end.,37,,
315,0.97,1982.814,1983.581,"Yeah, Dana.",38,,
316,0.97,1983.581,1985.583,Governor Juarez is a member of the committee.,38,,
317,0.97,1985.583,1989.087,She's gonNA be upset because it got cut off here.,38,,
318,0.97,1989.087,1991.189,It's a weird graphic error on our part.,39,,
319,0.97,1991.189,1991.856,Not sure why.,39,,
320,0.97,1991.856,1995.159,"But yes, two additional schools up there in district 5.",39,,
321,0.97,1995.159,1998.863,And it's Robert Eagle staff and?,40,,
322,0.97,1998.863,2000.865,Northgate elementary and Olympic hills.,41,,
323,0.97,2000.865,2006.07,"Oh, sorry, okay.",42,,
324,0.97,2006.07,2007.038,Got it.,42,,
325,0.97,2007.038,2007.905,Thank you so much.,42,,
326,0.97,2007.905,2009.707,Of course.,43,,
327,0.97,2009.707,2022.52,One point I want to reiterate is that the levy Express direct services supports two historically Underserved communities.,43,,
328,0.97,2022.52,2023.121,For educational justice.,43,,
329,0.97,2023.121,2032.43,"As a result of that, we see that the schools that we're funding have a greater racial and ethnically diverse population than schools as a whole.",43,,
330,0.97,2032.43,2035.733,It's about a third of the District's total at the moment.,43,,
331,0.97,2035.733,2035.933,28%.,43,,
332,0.97,2035.933,2050.515,"And of those students enrolled in the schools, 62% are students of color as compared to just 34% in SPs so far.",43,,
333,0.97,2050.515,2057.655,We are making sure that services are directed to students who need the help most.,43,,
334,0.97,2057.655,2066.864,"Across the district, these students serve about half of all the black male students in the public schools.",43,,
335,0.97,2066.864,2073.571,"We know that's a goal for us, to make sure that students are advancing and reaching their full potential.",43,,
336,0.97,2073.571,2077.208,And the schools also enrolled 24% identified as English language learners.,43,,
337,0.97,2077.208,2082.246,Which is another population that we want to make sure that we're addressing services toward.,43,,
338,0.97,2082.246,2085.583,And we help them progress toward their educational goals.,43,,
339,0.97,2085.583,2090.054,And that's a greater percentage than the District overall as well.,43,,
340,0.97,2090.054,2103.601,"So overall, this supplemental funding is really intended to make sure that students have access to educational opportunities and the opportunity to reach their full potential.",43,,
341,0.97,2103.601,2113.411,"So before we move onto the other funding opportunity, let me make a few quick comments about this fall.",43,,
342,0.97,2113.411,2116.881,Obviously we are entering a fall that is like no other.,43,,
343,0.97,2116.881,2120.218,We've been working with our partners diligently since the spring.,43,,
344,0.97,2120.218,2128.726,And what we have been doing is adapting and modifying the services to make sure that they're accommodating the current circumstances.,43,,
345,0.97,2128.726,2131.729,So that means more direct virtual learning support.,43,,
346,0.97,2131.729,2136.033,More focus on social and emotional well-being.,43,,
347,0.97,2136.033,2149.347,"And more support for basic needs, including Internet Connectivity, and access to services that are critical in this current time.",43,,
348,0.97,2149.347,2157.221,Our partners have been incredibly Adaptive and figuring out creative ways to make sure we reach students and families in this unusual context.,43,,
349,0.97,2157.221,2164.529,We anticipate continuing to work with our partners at the school district as needs evolve.,43,,
350,0.97,2164.529,2167.565,We just wrapped up SPs's strong start period.,43,,
351,0.97,2167.565,2169.767,And we start four full schedules next week.,43,,
352,0.97,2169.767,2177.241,And we'll be closely monitoring how students are doing in that environment and making sure that our services are backed accordingly.,43,,
353,0.97,2177.241,2178.809,"Next slide, please.",43,,
354,0.97,2179.11,2189.887,Two other funding opportunities that we ran recently.,44,,
355,0.97,2189.887,2195.86,"Both of these, again, centered community input, and included technical assistance.",44,,
356,0.97,2195.86,2199.297,The review panels all participated in Antibias training.,44,,
357,0.97,2199.297,2205.102,And we Prioritized equity and application review.,44,,
358,0.97,2205.102,2217.181,"And in addition, we had former SPs high school students participating in the review panel process to make sure we had voices.",44,,
359,0.97,2217.181,2230.027,"For the housing support, the funds were awarded to the Wyca to implement the Codesigned program called student stability program.",44,,
360,0.97,2230.027,2235.032,"This brings together the Ywca, Seattle public schools, the human services Department.",44,,
361,0.97,2235.032,2243.641,As well as deals to Collaboratively provide support and funding assistance to assist those that are Unstably housed or experiencing homelessness.,44,,
362,0.97,2243.641,2250.047,And the expressed intent here is to serve African-American families.,44,,
363,0.97,2250.047,2255.453,Programming provides them with additional resources to obtain and maintain Staibl housing.,44,,
364,0.97,2255.453,2260.658,So it includes a referral process.,44,,
365,0.97,2260.658,2265.363,Or SPs staff make direct connections to the Ywca.,44,,
366,0.97,2265.363,2267.264,Needs assessments are conducted.,44,,
367,0.97,2267.264,2281.779,And it Trngdzs into emergency assistance funding or connection to additional services.,44,,
368,0.97,2281.779,2283.681,Programming here began last spring.,44,,
369,0.97,2283.681,2290.087,"And to address your point, we've already worked diligently to adapt to the Covid context.",44,,
370,0.97,2290.087,2298.462,"An example would be an early revision to the model to ensure that we continued services over the course of the summer, rather than just being restricted to the school year.",44,,
371,0.97,2298.462,2308.773,"In addition, we've expanded access to accept referrals from all Seattle public schools rather than just those few that we had targeted initially.",44,,
372,0.97,2308.773,2318.382,"And Lastly, all partners have really adapted outreach and engagement efforts to make sure that we are accepting as many referrals as possible.",44,,
373,0.97,2318.382,2324.488,And we expect demand to continue to pick up as the fall progresses and everyone is coming back in session and the weather is changing outside.,44,,
374,0.97,2329.96,2334.732,"Dana, on the homelessness and housing support service, I want to thank you all for your hard work in that space.",45,,
375,0.97,2334.732,2349.714,That was a priority area of funding for me in particular.,45,,
376,0.97,2349.714,2365.062,"And one of the questions that we have is in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, we know that the unemployment rates are at an all-time high.",45,,
377,0.97,2365.062,2376.741,"In fact, there was just an article published today about another increase, another bump in the unemployment role.",45,,
378,0.97,2376.741,2388.753,I'm just wondering whether the Department has given any thought between the intersection of this line of business and ongoing Eviction moratoriums.,45,,
379,0.97,2388.753,2396.26,"And rental investment, rental assistance investments that are being done by United way and other partners.",45,,
380,0.97,2396.26,2397.128,Through Hsd dollars.,45,,
381,0.97,2397.128,2400.765,Not through Fep levy dollars.,45,,
382,0.97,2400.765,2403.667,I would be interested in hearing from you how you're approaching that.,45,,
383,0.97,2403.667,2431.896,And whether or not there's been conversations with other partners in the rental assistance area to figure out how to leverage dollars here and make sure that we're really going granular in terms of the kinds of family who would ordinarily qualify for this but may be experiencing disproportionately the impacts of unemployment rates and the realities of Eviction.,45,,
384,0.97,2431.896,2435.099,"Yeah, thank you for that question.",46,,
385,0.97,2435.099,2435.466,Most definitely.,46,,
386,0.97,2435.466,2444.241,It's something that we're watching closely and have been doing a lot of talking about.,46,,
387,0.97,2444.241,2445.142,Since this pandemic began.,46,,
388,0.97,2445.142,2451.148,So it's certainly true that we are working to leverage as many partners in this space as we possibly can.,46,,
389,0.97,2451.148,2456.854,And the model itself includes connection to services beyond housing.,46,,
390,0.97,2456.854,2460.524,That means also the related employment and income.,46,,
391,0.97,2460.524,2471.168,"Any food security needs, health, legal, or other family and community needs are all part of that needs assessment and if we're unable to address them with the directory.",46,,
392,0.97,2471.168,2477.441,Or show up to make connections in other spaces through city partners or through the broader community.,46,,
393,0.97,2477.441,2485.683,"And I think to your point, it's gonNA become even more closely watched over the course of the fall if some of those Eviction moratoriums come to a close.",46,,
394,0.97,2485.683,2487.284,So we'll be really closely monitoring this.,46,,
395,0.97,2487.284,2493.591,As will the partners that are working on it to make sure that we're doing as much as we can to connect to resources that are available.,46,,
396,0.97,2493.591,2494.825,Great.,47,,
397,0.97,2494.825,2498.662,And I wean have limited resources in this particular bucket.,47,,
398,0.97,2498.662,2500.498,I wanted there are to be more resources.,47,,
399,0.97,2500.498,2509.673,But of course we have to turn the dial carefully when we're asking for the levy to be renewed.,47,,
400,0.97,2509.673,2512.276,And this is sort of an initial new line of business for us.,47,,
401,0.97,2512.276,2517.514,So I appreciate that we don't have unlimited resources in this area.,47,,
402,0.97,2517.514,2519.917,Certainly not to meet the scale of the need.,47,,
403,0.97,2519.917,2527.057,And the scale of the need is growing because of the realities of how Covid has impacted our families.,47,,
404,0.97,2527.057,2556.954,And I just want to make sure that we are working Proactively to address the needs of and identifying families who might be at imminent risk of Eviction once the moratoriums are lifted as sort of another layer of targeted focus that could help us meet the greatest need of families in the area of housing stability.,47,,
405,0.97,2556.954,2558.122,"Yeah, great point.",48,,
406,0.97,2558.122,2572.202,And a great benefit of the way that this particular investment was designed around prevention modeling so we have the ability to foresee and prevent falling further into housing insecurity.,48,,
407,0.97,2572.202,2577.041,"Yes, we will certainly monitor it really closely and are happy to follow up as the fall progresses and things continue to take shape.",48,,
408,0.97,2577.041,2580.177,Thank you.,49,,
409,0.97,2580.177,2586.65,The other funding process I want to note here before moving on is around our opportunity access awards.,50,,
410,0.97,2586.65,2589.286,"And as Dwayne shared, we just announced a few weeks ago.",50,,
411,0.97,2589.286,2598.362,And they will take us through the next three years for the ten organizations that you see here.,50,,
412,0.97,2598.362,2605.536,"Funds are providing expanded learning, college readiness programming for the fall.",50,,
413,0.97,2605.536,2615.713,We certainly anticipate and have talked with partners and providers about how to be as creative as we can to make the remote learning context work.,50,,
414,0.97,2615.713,2623.821,It has certainly showed a need for greater emotional support so students feel supported in the remote context.,50,,
415,0.97,2623.821,2636.5,And these investments include a mix of continuing and new partners which is exciting to be able to expand our network of community partners as we work toward improved outcomes for students.,50,,
416,0.97,2636.5,2644.441,"Over the next of just this academic year, I should say, these investments anticipate reaching over 1,400 students.",50,,
417,0.97,2644.441,2665.095,"So Wyre excited for this, again, new opportunity through the Fep levy to continue our support for students.",50,,
418,0.97,2669.5,2671.735,Two middle schools and two high schools.,50,,
419,0.97,2671.735,2684.581,And what this means is that now we have School-Based health centers in all the comprehensive middle and high schools in all of Seattle public schools.,50,,
420,0.97,2684.581,2698.362,"And on the elementary side, funding for School-Based health centers, which were new under the previous levy, was Redid in order to ensure that schools have access.",50,,
421,0.97,2698.362,2706.704,And we could Tweak the model based on some of the lessons we learned from the previous levy.,50,,
422,0.97,2706.704,2707.337,"Oh, Yeah, council member?",50,,
423,0.97,2707.337,2709.406,"Yeah, thank you.",51,,
424,0.97,2709.406,2709.74,Go ahead.,52,,
425,0.97,2709.74,2721.285,"On that last slide regarding health centers, the health center at Nova middle school has always been very important to me.",53,,
426,0.97,2721.285,2727.791,We know that across the street at Garfield is not necessarily serving the students in the best place.,53,,
427,0.97,2727.791,2734.231,And requesting them to go to the world school a while away uphill is also not the best way to serve them.,53,,
428,0.97,2734.231,2741.505,So I'm really grateful to see that we have moved forward with a health center at Nova.,53,,
429,0.97,2741.505,2749.012,I know that in the Fepp levy we were able to provide--or maybe it was during the budget session.,53,,
430,0.97,2749.012,2753.35,We were able to provide seed funding for this.,53,,
431,0.97,2753.35,2754.051,This health center.,53,,
432,0.97,2754.051,2757.621,Has that--have we found that matched funding?,53,,
433,0.97,2757.621,2763.16,This is a fully open health center now?,53,,
434,0.97,2763.16,2766.964,"Sure, yes, absolutely.",54,,
435,0.97,2766.964,2767.965,Y right.,54,,
436,0.97,2767.965,2782.513,"This is a new venture, and it included some capital improvements to be sure they were set up properly to provide the full range of health services.",54,,
437,0.97,2782.513,2784.548,Those have continued through school closures and this environment.,54,,
438,0.97,2784.548,2786.049,It is not fully open yet.,54,,
439,0.97,2786.049,2788.652,But services are expected to begin this fall.,54,,
440,0.97,2788.652,2793.791,At that site just like all the other School-Based health centers will be open.,54,,
441,0.97,2793.791,2800.931,So it's a Úvery exciting new service to be able to offer to make sure that those students feel safe and supported in that environment.,54,,
442,0.97,2800.931,2801.999,"Wonderful, thank you.",55,,
443,0.97,2801.999,2811.475,"So you just hit on my follow-up question, which Ises even though students are remote learning, are they able to access their health centers at the physical locations?",55,,
444,0.97,2811.475,2813.076,And how does that work?,55,,
445,0.97,2813.076,2814.211,Great question.,56,,
446,0.97,2814.211,2818.682,"And if we can maybe advance to the next slide, and I'll speak to that a little bit here too.",56,,
447,0.97,2818.682,2838.936,"One critical point they want to make is while you see on the screen here our full suite of 29 School-Based health centers, and the health providers that help support operations there, any Seattle public school student can access School-Based health services.",56,,
448,0.97,2838.936,2846.343,Regardless of whether or not their enrolled school has a health center Onsite.,56,,
449,0.97,2846.343,2859.256,"And for the fall it's exciting to see that we're gonNA be able to after a combination of services through both Onsite at the school, In-Community at some of the Community-Based clinics, as well as through web or Phone-Based Telehealth services.",56,,
450,0.97,2859.256,2871.768,"So we're really trying to make sure that what continues to be a critical need, need for Healthcare hasn't gone away just because we're in this Remolt context.",56,,
451,0.97,2871.768,2875.672,That students have access in a way that's gonNA meet the family best.,56,,
452,0.97,2875.672,2885.449,"Whether that be Onsite in campus, in the community or virtually.",56,,
453,0.97,2885.449,2889.686,"Yeah, very exciting.",56,,
454,0.97,2889.686,2902.866,"And I have to acknowledge our Publics at King County, as well as our partners at Seattle public schools who have been great making sure we can open those buildings and provide those services for students.",56,,
455,0.97,2902.866,2911.775,"So again, a collectively effort for all partners involve leader to be able to make sure that access is maintained for students throughout the remote learning period.",56,,
456,0.97,2911.775,2913.577,"Next slide, please.",56,,
457,0.97,2913.577,2922.386,Back to you Dwayne.,56,,
458,0.97,2922.386,2922.886,Yes.,57,,
459,0.97,2922.886,2925.322,Thank you.,57,,
460,0.97,2925.322,2940.737,"So in closing--actually before I close, I wanted to circle back and let you know that the Spp providers have the option to choose one of three program models.",57,,
461,0.97,2940.737,2944.107,100% remote learning with program supports.,57,,
462,0.97,2944.107,2946.943,In-Person programming with current H guidelines.,57,,
463,0.97,2946.943,2948.945,Or a hybrid combination of both.,57,,
464,0.97,2948.945,2956.653,"And based on provider choice, about 40% of our children will receive remote services this fall.",57,,
465,0.97,2956.653,2963.16,Which is largely represented by the SPs program.,57,,
466,0.97,2963.16,2973.503,And 30% will be in both person and hybrid program programs.,57,,
467,0.97,2973.503,2978.442,The other one was we know that Spp tuition is reduced for this year.,57,,
468,0.97,2978.442,2990.587,"Sore should I say families receiving In-Person services will receive about 50% off of tuition for the year, and tuition will be waived for families receiving 100% remote Spp.",57,,
469,0.97,2990.587,3003.066,So I wanted to share that with you before I actually close and speak to this slide right here.,57,,
470,0.97,3003.066,3003.7,Hold on.,58,,
471,0.97,3003.7,3007.237,It looks like Council member Strauss has a question.,58,,
472,0.97,3007.237,3019.483,How are students made aware that they're able to access Laker at any school?,59,,
473,0.97,3019.483,3020.817,Good question.,60,,
474,0.97,3020.817,3021.418,Sorry.,61,,
475,0.97,3021.418,3022.219,That's okay.,62,,
476,0.97,3022.219,3024.721,"Again, a combined effort here.",63,,
477,0.97,3024.721,3026.69,Definitely being Messaged through School-Based staff.,63,,
478,0.97,3026.69,3036.032,And especially our nursing partners through Seattle public schools.,63,,
479,0.97,3036.032,3040.337,"Outreach is being conducted through our health agencies as well, through their avenues.",63,,
480,0.97,3040.337,3043.206,And another critical peace here is our family support staff.,63,,
481,0.97,3043.206,3051.481,And those through SPs are often the ones that position to be able to point students and families toward resources.,63,,
482,0.97,3051.481,3054.518,S. so they're also a critical part of the Messaging part.,63,,
483,0.97,3054.518,3058.688,Thank you for that question and supplemental answer.,64,,
484,0.97,3058.688,3063.627,"Back to you, director Chapelle.",64,,
485,0.97,3063.627,3063.86,Okay.,65,,
486,0.97,3063.86,3069.933,"Now in closing, we have two upcoming funding processes this fall.",65,,
487,0.97,3069.933,3072.903,Both in support of the Seattle police school program.,65,,
488,0.97,3072.903,3084.548,We will conduct our annual call for Spp classrooms where existing Spp and Spp Pathway providers can raise their hand and expand--raise their hand to expand.,65,,
489,0.97,3084.548,3090.954,And new providers can express their interest in offering Spp.,65,,
490,0.97,3090.954,3100.697,"And we will again offer the new annual facilities funding, opportunity for Spp and Spp Pathway providers.",65,,
491,0.97,3100.697,3106.77,Through which providers can improve the conditions for quality of their existing Spp classrooms.,65,,
492,0.97,3106.77,3111.208,Or expand their business with new Spp classrooms.,65,,
493,0.97,3111.208,3120.917,"Next slide, please.",65,,
494,0.97,3120.917,3121.618,And there we have.,65,,
495,0.97,3121.618,3123.587,I guess we'll pause for questions.,65,,
496,0.97,3123.587,3127.557,"Yeah, thank you so much, director Chapelle.",66,,
497,0.97,3127.557,3128.425,Really appreciate it.,66,,
498,0.97,3128.425,3134.998,I know there was some information previously provided around promise which is not in this version of the presentation.,66,,
499,0.97,3134.998,3147.711,But I did want to ask a quick question about Seattle promise if I could.,66,,
500,0.97,3148.612,3162.926,"Originally when we looked at the Fepp Lev Ethe model assumed Enfepp levy, the model assumed 1,300 Studentses for this fall.",66,,
501,0.97,3162.926,3206.002,"And looking at the notes that my staff gave to me, based on the number of applications that were actually received, 1,762 applications, if the enrollment rates are similar to the previous two years, 21% increase what the model originally predicted or assumed.",66,,
502,0.97,3206.002,3216.58,So I'm just wondering how deal is planning--whether deal is planning to fund the higher-than-expected enrollment in the Seattle promise program.,66,,
503,0.97,3216.58,3223.019,"And if so, how deal is planning on doing that funding.",66,,
504,0.97,3223.019,3224.221,Yes.,67,,
505,0.97,3224.221,3226.59,"Dana, you should feel confident right now.",67,,
506,0.97,3226.59,3228.692,Should we circle back with the Council President?,67,,
507,0.97,3228.692,3233.33,"Yeah, I'm more than happy to circle back.",68,,
508,0.97,3233.33,3233.897,As needed.,68,,
509,0.97,3233.897,3247.31,"I think we can say this is really exciting to be able to welcome our first class this fall that includes students from across the district, after the expansion to all the students that you alluded to.",68,,
510,0.97,3247.31,3257.454,"And we're closely monitoring how the Covid situation is Impacting enrollment, and we'll have some updated information Mroibl within the next month probably within the next month.",68,,
511,0.97,3257.454,3260.357,The first day of school for them begins on the 29th of the month.,68,,
512,0.97,3260.357,3267.664,"And it's certainly been a discussion to your point, being able to support higher-than-expected enrollment.",68,,
513,0.97,3267.664,3278.475,And we have some contingency plans and can certainly follow up on additional detail as we get a firmer sense of what enrollment is gonNA look like.,68,,
514,0.97,3278.475,3283.913,"That would be super, super helpful.",69,,
515,0.97,3283.913,3310.407,"And I think that, really, what I want to make sure we're having some Fidelity to is around questions about Underspend from either the families education levy or from the Fepp levy as a result of a lot of different variables that we're all dealing with in 2020.",69,,
516,0.97,3310.407,3314.477,So I'd appreciate a follow-up.,69,,
517,0.97,3314.477,3322.485,And the recent announcement by Mayor Durkan that directs $5 million in Mentorship programs for youth.,69,,
518,0.97,3322.485,3327.424,And a specific question about how these programs are being funded.,69,,
519,0.97,3327.424,3341.738,And whether any portion of the $5 million is--is a result of Underspend from either the families Needcasion levy or the current Fepp levy.,69,,
520,0.97,3341.738,3345.141,It we add that one to the follow-up list with you?,70,,
521,0.97,3345.141,3351.481,"Once we connect with you about the Seattle Prom, we'll follow up with you about that one as well?",70,,
522,0.97,3351.481,3351.681,Okay.,70,,
523,0.97,3351.681,3352.115,"Yeah, absolutely.",71,,
524,0.97,3352.115,3362.726,"I just wanted to put that on the record, that it would be good for us to know whether any of the Underspends were being used for that.",71,,
525,0.97,3362.726,3365.562,I apologize for all this coughing.,71,,
526,0.97,3365.562,3366.362,Don't worry.,72,,
527,0.97,3366.362,3368.665,But the smoke is really irritating me.,73,,
528,0.97,3368.665,3375.972,"I'm sure others are feeling the same thing, having the same experience.",73,,
529,0.97,3375.972,3377.674,"Okay, colleagues.",73,,
530,0.97,3377.674,3385.982,Any questions for director Chapelle Ordaina on the presentation?,73,,
531,0.97,3385.982,3391.254,It's almost 3:00 which is about when we were slated to switch to the next topic.,73,,
532,0.97,3391.254,3392.989,"Council member Strauss, please.",73,,
533,0.97,3392.989,3397.761,"Thank you, Council president and chair.",74,,
534,0.97,3397.761,3402.499,"Director Chapelle, Dana.",74,,
535,0.97,3402.499,3403.5,My comments earlier this week.,74,,
536,0.97,3403.5,3405.568,This presentation speaks exactly to your work.,74,,

542,0.97,3419.015,3420.717,Thank you.,75,,

544,0.97,3425.488,3426.022,And they're awesome.,75,,
545,0.97,3426.022,3429.058,"So literally if it wasn't for my team, none of this would be a focus.",75,,
546,0.97,3429.058,3433.229,But thank you.,75,,
547,0.97,3433.229,3435.698,Council members can certainly relate to that sentiment.,76,,
548,0.97,3435.698,3440.637,"If it wasn't for our teams, we wouldn't be able to do the work we're doing.",76,,
549,0.97,3440.637,3443.74,I appreciate the recognition of your team as well.,76,,
550,0.97,3443.74,3454.584,"Colleagues, any other questions or comments?",76,,
551,0.97,3455.985,3457.053,Scanning the virtual room.,76,,
552,0.97,3457.053,3459.255,Looks like there are no other questions and comments.,76,,
553,0.97,3459.255,3464.327,I want to go ahead and close out this portion of the agenda for today.,76,,
554,0.97,3464.327,3472.268,"Dana and director Chapelle, thank you so much for spending time on pulling together this really important presentation.",76,,
555,0.97,3472.268,3475.605,Of course the Fepp levy is a taxpayer funded levy.,76,,
556,0.97,3475.605,3482.378,So I felt it was really important to get a report out on how we are spending those dollars.,76,,
557,0.97,3482.378,3482.779,This year.,76,,
558,0.97,3482.779,3486.282,And I was on maternity leave for the first quarter.,76,,
559,0.97,3486.282,3493.656,And I came back from maternity leave and now we're in a pandemic.,76,,
560,0.97,3493.656,3517.213,"And so I do appreciate your willingness to, amidst everything that is happening, to make time to join us in a special committee hearing today to--for this Committee hearing.",76,,
561,0.97,3517.213,3526.923,"My gratitude to both of you and to the entire deal staff for the hard work that I know you all are doing in the evolving, ever-changing times.",76,,
562,0.97,3526.923,3527.257,All right.,77,,
563,0.97,3527.257,3530.627,We thank you and we appreciate your support.,77,,
564,0.97,3530.627,3531.527,And happy to come again.,77,,
565,0.97,3531.527,3532.362,Let us know.,77,,
566,0.97,3532.362,3533.696,"All right, thank you.",78,,
567,0.97,3533.696,3534.43,Thank you.,79,,
568,0.97,3534.43,3534.898,"Thank you, folks.",80,,
569,0.97,3534.898,3535.498,"Okay, Bye.",81,,
570,0.97,3535.498,3536.966,You're free to go.,82,,
571,0.97,3536.966,3537.267,Take care.,82,,
572,0.97,3537.267,3537.734,Thank you.,83,,
573,0.97,3537.734,3538.134,Bye.,84,,
574,0.97,3538.134,3544.407,We're gonNA go ahead and move into the next agenda item.,84,,
575,0.97,3544.407,3554.35,Will the clerk please read items two and three into the record?,84,,
576,0.97,3554.35,3559.455,"Agenda item 2, 119896.",85,,
577,0.97,3559.455,3562.559,State ordinance.,85,,
578,0.97,3562.559,3562.859,Discretion.,85,,
579,0.97,3562.859,3563.359,Agenda item three.,85,,
580,0.97,3563.359,3565.595,Violations of civil emergency orders.,85,,
581,0.97,3565.595,3571.434,Thank you so much for reading both of those agenda items.,86,,
582,0.97,3571.434,3574.637,That way we can just move smoothly through both of them.,86,,
583,0.97,3574.637,3590.186,Let's go ahead and start with the briefing and discussion of agenda item 2 which is regarding violations of civil Emer orders.,86,,
584,0.97,3590.186,3598.962,"Carina, do you want to kick us off on the examination first?",86,,
585,0.97,3598.962,3600.296,I'll begin it.,87,,
586,0.97,3600.296,3601.597,I am on Council's central staff.,87,,
587,0.97,3601.597,3605.068,And I will provide an overview of these two related bills.,87,,
588,0.97,3605.068,3614.911,And I'll begin by sharing my screen so that Council members and the public can see a memo that was submitted.,87,,
589,0.97,3614.911,3621.017,Can everyone see that?,87,,
590,0.97,3621.017,3624.22,These 24 proposals sponsored by Council member Lewis.,87,,
591,0.97,3624.22,3630.927,And they are both related to action for civil Emer orders.,87,,
592,0.97,3630.927,3631.928,A quick overview of both.,87,,
593,0.97,3631.928,3640.203,And then I'll dive a little deeper into the first one which is the Council bill.,87,,
594,0.97,3640.203,3647.01,So Council bill 119869 would amend Seattle mutual code.,87,,
595,0.97,3647.01,3647.276,10.02.110.,87,,
596,0.97,3647.276,3651.047,To make some general changes in how civil emergency orders are enforced.,87,,
597,0.97,3651.047,3654.917,It would allow some civil remedies and update the criminal penalties.,87,,
598,0.97,3654.917,3666.062,"Then if this proposal passes by Council, then that would provide a legal basis for considering resolution 31966.",87,,
599,0.97,3666.062,3676.172,And that resolution would add these new enforcement options to the Mayor's order relating to capping restaurant delivery and pickup.,87,,
600,0.97,3676.172,3688.084,"For a deeper dive into Council bill 119869, the Mayor is authorized to issue civil emergency orders under the code.",87,,
601,0.97,3688.084,3689.052,It's chapter 10.02.,87,,
602,0.97,3689.052,3693.656,"And under this code, the Mayor can issue simple emergencies.",87,,
603,0.97,3693.656,3694.891,And then related civil emergency orders.,87,,
604,0.97,3694.891,3702.699,So of course one example that we're all very familiar with is the Covid-19 emergency order that was issued on March 3RD.,87,,
605,0.97,3702.699,3703.533,There are other ones.,87,,
606,0.97,3703.533,3707.904,A civil emergency related to homeless know.,87,,
607,0.97,3707.904,3712.175,And there's a civil emergency related to the West Seattle bridge.,87,,
608,0.97,3712.175,3724.287,"Under the code, the sole method for enforcing a violation of any civil emergency order that's related to the civil emergency is just a criminal penalty.",87,,
609,0.97,3724.287,3733.863,"And that criminal penalty requires conviction of a misdemeanor to impose a fine, which right now is $500 or imprisonment or both a fine and imprisonment.",87,,
610,0.97,3733.863,3740.436,"And just to specify, it is up to $500.",87,,
611,0.97,3740.436,3741.804,And up to 180 Kays.,87,,
612,0.97,3741.804,3742.004,Days.,87,,
613,0.97,3742.004,3751.814,"So to give some context, the one that is directly at issue is the Mayor's order relating to capping restaurant Sdmrefr pickup Commission fees.",87,,
614,0.97,3751.814,3754.917,That third party Apps are able to charge Strants.,87,,
615,0.97,3754.917,3758.855,There are some other ones as well.,87,,
616,0.97,3758.855,3798.494,There's currently an emergency order relating to a moratorium on residential Evictions and small business Evictioncurrently an emergency order relating to a moratorium on residential Evictions and small business Evictions.,87,,
617,0.97,3798.494,3805.234,"It would amend the penalty, the fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days or both.",87,,
618,0.97,3805.234,3809.772,So that is a correction that would need to be made.,87,,
619,0.97,3809.772,3817.68,And next it would allow for the option of civil Rem Ghees to enforce remedies to enforce a violation of the emergency orders.,87,,
620,0.97,3817.68,3821.017,Specifically it would allow the city to have a method to enforce these orders.,87,,
621,0.97,3821.017,3825.021,"And also members of the public, a way to enforce these orders.",87,,
622,0.97,3825.021,3832.128,"For the city, it would authorize a class 1 civil frequency.",87,,
623,0.97,3832.128,3832.461,Infraction.,87,,
624,0.97,3832.461,3842.838,And that is a type of enforcement that state law establishes.,87,,
625,0.97,3842.838,3849.145,They could be subject to a penalty up to $250 and statutory assessment.,87,,
626,0.97,3849.145,3856.552,And the other civil remedy would be the ability for members of the public to file a private writ of action.,87,,
627,0.97,3856.552,3870.666,"They would be able to sue someone, take them to court for a violation of an emergency order if a person or class of persons was harmed by the violation.",87,,
628,0.97,3870.666,3875.638,And so any specific emergency order would specify which of these types of enforcement actions would apply.,87,,
629,0.97,3875.638,3876.873,It would be at least one.,87,,
630,0.97,3876.873,3881.344,And it could be up to all three.,87,,
631,0.97,3881.344,3887.783,And the substance of the emergency order would obviously guide what type of enforcement options would be appropriate.,87,,
632,0.97,3887.783,3901.497,"A quick NOTE on the civil Infractions and the city's enforcement of those, there are three departments that can enforce civil actions.",87,,
633,0.97,3901.497,3904.3,"The Department of Sdpnl administrative serves, the police Department and the city attorney's office.",87,,
634,0.97,3904.3,3909.972,The order would specify which of these diameters would enforce the order.,87,,
635,0.97,3909.972,3914.677,And then the process is already established for enforcement of existing C Infractions.,87,,
636,0.97,3914.677,3924.487,"So as you can see in the memo, the city attorney's office would review any find big that specific diameter.",87,,
637,0.97,3924.487,3931.827,And then that Department would issue a notice of infraction.,87,,
638,0.97,3931.827,3939.602,Then the person would either pay that amount of money or appeal it to mutual court where they could enter into a settlement.,87,,
639,0.97,3939.602,3944.907,Or they could go into a hearing in front of a magistrate.,87,,
640,0.97,3944.907,3952.448,If they wanted to further contest it.,87,,
641,0.97,3952.448,3964.06,"So I noted earlier, if Council passes this proposal, that would provide a legal basis for amending the Mayor's order related to restaurant delivery and pickup Commission fees.",87,,
642,0.97,3964.06,3966.862,I will look to the memo regarding that proposal.,87,,
643,0.97,3966.862,3971.967,Here it is.,87,,
644,0.97,3971.967,3981.377,"Profile with some identifications, a couple days later by city council.",87,,
645,0.97,3981.377,3986.282,The basic premise of the order is threefold.,87,,
646,0.97,3986.282,3997.893,"First the order approaches third-party Apps, Postmates, Grubhub, Uber eats, from charging restaurants a Commission fee of more than 15% per order that their drivers deliver.",87,,
647,0.97,3997.893,4005.701,The order also prohibits the third-party Apps from reducing the compensation of drivers as a result of the order going into effect.,87,,
648,0.97,4005.701,4014.11,And it also prohibits the third-party Apps from reducing areas of service to the city as a result of the order.,87,,
649,0.97,4014.11,4022.318,"What this resolution does, it proposes increasing the enforcement options that are Availabl violations.",87,,
650,0.97,4022.318,4024.92,Of this order.,87,,
651,0.97,4024.92,4033.929,And those enforcement options would include the full place of what's available under 10.02.,87,,
652,0.97,4033.929,4039.835,"Number one, it would allow civil Infractions to enforce the order.",87,,
653,0.97,4039.835,4045.875,And the order specifies that the consumer protection division and FAS would enforce the Infractions.,87,,
654,0.97,4045.875,4051.847,And Jessica Shart available today to talk more about that.,87,,
655,0.97,4051.847,4063.759,"If a third-party App is found to have violated more than two times the emergency order, the director of FAS could decide to move forward with the criminal prosecution.",87,,
656,0.97,4063.759,4067.763,And that's where there would be consideration of the misdemeanor penalty.,87,,
657,0.97,4067.763,4077.84,"That would know updated again to reflect the current penalty of up to $1,000 fine or imprisonment of up to 90 days.",87,,
658,0.97,4077.84,4086.449,Also the order would specify that an idea or class of persons could file a private writ of action for violation.,87,,
659,0.97,4086.449,4112.508,So that would allow an opportunity for restaurant business owners and drivers and members of the public to have the ability to file private writ of action if the Commission was too high or if the driver believed that their compensation was reduced as a result of the order or also if people believe that their neighborhood where they live was no longer being serviced by the App as a result of the order.,87,,
660,0.97,4112.508,4116.212,Going into effect.,87,,
661,0.97,4116.212,4119.415,And one important piece to mention about the Council bill.,87,,
662,0.97,4119.415,4125.287,And that is reflected in the resolution.,87,,
663,0.97,4125.287,4135.998,Is that the amendment to the code that would allow the civil enforcement options--defines person.,87,,
664,0.97,4135.998,4154.717,So as you might IMA pursuing a criminal charge against a can be corporation can be difficult.,87,,
665,0.97,4154.717,4156.252,That say brief overview.,87,,
666,0.97,4156.252,4158.787,Are there any questions about either proposal?,87,,
667,0.97,4158.787,4159.655,"Thank you, Carina, for that.",88,,
668,0.97,4159.655,4176.639,"Before we open it up for questions, I did want to give Council member Lewis an opportunity to address the bill since he's the--the bill and the resolution as a prime sponsor of both.",88,,
669,0.97,4176.639,4191.186,And then I think we'll add some additional detail.,88,,
670,0.97,4191.186,4193.189,"Thank you so much, Madame chair.",89,,
671,0.97,4193.189,4198.994,And thank you for the invitation of the committee today to address this.,89,,
672,0.97,4198.994,4201.597,I think I'm purely here now as a person.,89,,
673,0.97,4201.597,4205.334,It looks like all five sitting members of the committee are here.,89,,
674,0.97,4205.334,4207.503,So I appreciate the invitation to discuss this.,89,,
675,0.97,4207.503,4213.809,So the origin of this is pretty simple.,89,,
676,0.97,4213.809,4228.123,"Following the imposition of the fee cap, the restaurant fee cap, the executive order that was pursued with the leadership of Council President Gonzcez and Council had been Herbold in particular.",89,,
677,0.97,4228.123,4230.926,And Mayor Durkan.,89,,
678,0.97,4230.926,4233.696,I received an inquiry from a constituent accident concerned.,89,,
679,0.97,4233.696,4237.099,Because they believed that the cap was still being passed along to them.,89,,
680,0.97,4237.099,4239.201,"And they wanted my assistance on, you know, what do I do?",89,,
681,0.97,4239.201,4244.54,What do I do in the case where the order is being violated?,89,,
682,0.97,4244.54,4246.675,So I responded that's a great question.,89,,
683,0.97,4246.675,4250.412,Let's figure out kind of what some of the things are here in the code.,89,,
684,0.97,4250.412,4258.554,And I was Sorta surprised to see that a lot of the enforcement provisions were fairly outdated or a little ambiguous.,89,,
685,0.97,4258.554,4261.523,Or not clear.,89,,
686,0.97,4261.523,4285.18,"I had not encountered during my previous career as a Prosecutor in the Seattle mutual court any kind of strange criminal sanction that was 180 days in jail or a $500 fine and was not surprised to see that that was a Leftover sort of relic from 1978 when, I guess, that was a more common definition of a misdemeanor in Washington state.",89,,
687,0.97,4285.18,4289.118,So I contacted central staff.,89,,
688,0.97,4289.118,4290.786,It must have been early May.,89,,
689,0.97,4290.786,4292.187,And started working on this project back then.,89,,
690,0.97,4292.187,4299.194,"And we have had a lot of Back-And-Forth with the law Department, the various enforcement agencies.",89,,
691,0.97,4299.194,4301.664,I really want to thank Carina for her work on.,89,,
692,0.97,4301.664,4326.722,"This but especially since we're in a climate now where States of emergency have been very definitive of this year, 2020, and there's been lots of orders to try to address economic fallout from States of emergency that probably fall outside of the scope of--some of these ordinances we were expecting these orders to cover.",89,,
693,0.97,4326.722,4340.035,And it didn't seem to me that this old sort of misdemeanor would be adequate to potentially deter conduct in violation of these orders by corporate actors.,89,,
694,0.97,4340.035,4345.04,"Since we can't really, you know, like jail grub Hub.",89,,
695,0.97,4345.04,4349.244,In the King County jail if they Violet one of these orders.,89,,
696,0.97,4349.244,4354.316,So some kind of civil remedy seemed warranted for investigators to consider in the alternative.,89,,
697,0.97,4354.316,4356.251,And a private right of action.,89,,
698,0.97,4356.251,4368.297,If a group of restaurants wanted to band together and view some of these companies for violation violations.,89,,
699,0.97,4368.297,4372.468,Of the protections that they should be receiving under these emergency orders.,89,,
700,0.97,4372.468,4385.08,And especially as we see this year through the massive economic devastation that Covid has had.,89,,
701,0.97,4385.08,4394.89,And a lot of our orders that have interfered in the marketplace to make sure that equitable policies stay in place.,89,,
702,0.97,4394.89,4398.694,And economic fallout is prohibited and not hitting the most vulnerable in our community.,89,,
703,0.97,4398.694,4403.999,Refooling some of our enforcement mechanisms is warranted.,89,,
704,0.97,4403.999,4407.403,I do want to address the resolution briefly.,89,,
705,0.97,4407.403,4417.713,"The Mayor's office today suggested the possibility that in the ordinance passes, simply Resubmitting the entire order rather than trying to change it through resolution.",89,,
706,0.97,4417.713,4422.918,That is something I'm open to potentially pursuing on Monday as the alternative.,89,,
707,0.97,4422.918,4432.127,I think we could still do everything on Monday in the event the committee wants to pass the ordinance and consider this later this month.,89,,
708,0.97,4432.127,4446.074,But I just wanted to flag that as a potential alternative to the path of updating the fee cap through the resolution.,89,,
709,0.97,4446.074,4449.511,Instead Resubmitting the order in recognition of the new ordinance.,89,,
710,0.97,4449.511,4453.015,As something that the Mayor's office is interested in.,89,,
711,0.97,4453.015,4463.125,And they are supportive of the underlying ordinance that sort of Readdresses and updates some of these enforcement mechanisms.,89,,
712,0.97,4463.125,4465.26,That haven't really been Revisited since 1978.,89,,
713,0.97,4465.26,4468.23,And to adapt them to our current enforcement needs.,89,,
714,0.97,4468.23,4472.968,"I will add, and I know we have folks to present from the executive order.",89,,
715,0.97,4472.968,4485.447,I don't know that there's a considerable amount of data indicating that there have been ton of violations of these particular orders this year.,89,,
716,0.97,4485.447,4491.987,"But I still, frankly, think these pro changes will be warranted even if there's just one O violations.",89,,
717,0.97,4491.987,4508.804,And could be applicable to emergencies that are unanticipated in the future.,89,,
718,0.97,4510.372,4511.974,As they have been put forward.,89,,
719,0.97,4511.974,4514.309,"With that, I don't have anything else to add.",89,,
720,0.97,4514.309,4517.212,And I'll turn it back over to the other panelists.,89,,
721,0.97,4518.547,4522.084,"Thank you so much, council member Lewis.",90,,
722,0.97,4522.084,4525.487,For the sponsorship of this bill and the resolution as well.,90,,
723,0.97,4525.487,4532.661,Úand then I know we have some folks from the executive available to also give presentations.,90,,
724,0.97,4532.661,4533.996,So I'm gonNA go ahead and hand it over.,90,,
725,0.97,4533.996,4535.831,Sorry.,90,,
726,0.97,4535.831,4537.9,"That's okay, council member Gonzcez.",91,,
727,0.97,4537.9,4540.536,"It's a pleasure to see her, I will say.",91,,
728,0.97,4540.536,4542.037,It's a pleasure meeting with her.,91,,
729,0.97,4542.037,4553.649,"For those of you who don't know, my name is Beth Gafrt.",91,,
730,0.97,4553.649,4564.56,I wanted to give a brief overview of what my division does and how we could follow through on this updated ordinance and the changes.,91,,
731,0.97,4564.56,4571.233,We oversee the regulation and licensing of over 20 regulated business Industries within the city of Seattle.,91,,
732,0.97,4571.233,4580.175,From taxing fees to Shoerm rentals to Pawnshops to Towing companies to a Plethora of other industries in there.,91,,
733,0.97,4580.175,4582.511,We employ standard inspectors and supervisors.,91,,
734,0.97,4582.511,4590.285,And those folks have special law enforcement commissioners which allow them to engage in very limited law enforcement action.,91,,
735,0.97,4590.285,4596.091,They're commissioned against the Department director and his agents.,91,,
736,0.97,4596.091,4602.497,These inspectors have the authority to enter and inspect business establishments and to check evidence.,91,,
737,0.97,4602.497,4612.708,"From our perspective, the enforcement of this Fac allows FAS to help preserve the public peace, health, safety, and welfare of the city of Seattle.",91,,
738,0.97,4612.708,4623.618,"And while my division does have the ability to enforce Secs of the code, our focus really is on education and outreach toward businesses that Violet the code.",91,,
739,0.97,4623.618,4629.625,We already have mechanisms in place to respond to complaints about businesses.,91,,
740,0.97,4629.625,4638.634,"We utilize the model CSR system, which is the system folks call 684 city.",91,,
741,0.97,4638.634,4643.005,Is that the records management system we use in order to respond to complaints.,91,,
742,0.97,4643.005,4649.444,"What happens if someone were to file a complaint, call 684 city about this, that complaint would get routed to my team.",91,,
743,0.97,4649.444,4653.148,It would get assigned to a Cpd inspector.,91,,
744,0.97,4653.148,4657.419,And that person would contact the complainant and open an investigation into the complaint.,91,,
745,0.97,4657.419,4663.091,These are processes that we already have set up and are very easily adaptable to new types of complaints.,91,,
746,0.97,4663.091,4666.028,Such as the ones we're discussing today.,91,,
747,0.97,4666.028,4674.469,"As I said, we do have the authority to enforce--to issue civil Infractions to businesses that fail it comply.",91,,
748,0.97,4674.469,4683.945,"We do that already, Toeing company and Pawnshops for example are businesses that we do file Infractions in the mutual court.",91,,
749,0.97,4683.945,4688.383,"For this particular type of complaint, we estimate that conducting an investigation would take a couple of weeks.",91,,
750,0.97,4688.383,4690.719,And then we would file the fraction.,91,,
751,0.97,4690.719,4694.289,We would obviously partner with the law Department.,91,,
752,0.97,4694.289,4697.292,Then we would file the infraction in municipal court.,91,,
753,0.97,4697.292,4700.395,"And at that point, the infraction process takes its natural course.",91,,
754,0.97,4700.395,4702.964,It's just like a parking ticket or speeding ticket.,91,,
755,0.97,4702.964,4706.535,The court issues a summons and lets someone know that the infraction has been issued.,91,,
756,0.97,4706.535,4713.208,"They have the opportunity to pay it, contest it, or mitigate it and it would go through that process.",91,,
757,0.97,4713.208,4718.68,My division has 26 license and standards inspectors with the standard law enforcement commissioners.,91,,
758,0.97,4718.68,4724.72,Five of them are currently assigned to the citywide warehouse to all departments.,91,,
759,0.97,4724.72,4731.359,All of my relating inspectors are currently working remotely and have the experience and capacity to respond to this new type of complaint.,91,,
760,0.97,4731.359,4740.802,"Given what we know about the number of complaint, we do believe that we can incorporate this into our existing practices without additional staff and resources.",91,,
761,0.97,4740.802,4741.636,That's my update.,91,,
762,0.97,4741.636,4743.071,My overall--overview for you all on my division.,91,,
763,0.97,4743.071,4744.439,Thank you.,91,,
764,0.97,4744.439,4749.945,"Thank you, Beth for that report.",92,,
765,0.97,4749.945,4757.953,And for the additional information about the actual enforcement part of what we're trying to accomplish here.,92,,
766,0.97,4757.953,4759.821,Really appreciate it.,92,,
767,0.97,4759.821,4764.76,"Colleagues, any questions for Carina or Beth?",92,,
768,0.97,4764.76,4765.46,Or Council member Lewis.,92,,
769,0.97,4765.46,4768.163,About the resolution here?,92,,
770,0.97,4768.163,4771.867,I'm not seeing any additional questions.,92,,
771,0.97,4771.867,4778.406,"Colleagues, this item is just listed for briefing and discussion.",92,,
772,0.97,4778.406,4784.279,It's already listed to be on the agenda for full council.,92,,
773,0.97,4784.279,4792.487,So I expect that we will consider the bill and the resolution at this Monday's full council meeting.,92,,
774,0.97,4792.487,4795.724,Because it's already on the introduction referral calendar.,92,,
775,0.97,4795.724,4796.024,For Monday.,92,,
776,0.97,4796.024,4804.166,There's no need for Yous to take action.,92,,
777,0.97,4804.166,4808.103,For us to take action on this legislation in committee today.,92,,
778,0.97,4808.103,4823.218,"So Council member Lewis, in terms of your potential shifting around the resolution, we'll just make sure that our offices stay in close contact to get a better understanding of how that's gonNA play out for Monday's full council.",92,,
779,0.97,4823.218,4829.224,So let us--do let us know what you end up deciding.,92,,
780,0.97,4829.224,4837.132,"But for purposes of committee today, there's no need to take any votes today during committee since we've already got it listed and ready to roll for Monday.",92,,
781,0.97,4837.132,4842.237,But we will need that connect before then to make sure that we know Procedurally what you want to do next.,92,,
782,0.97,4842.237,4847.342,"Great, thank you so much.",93,,
783,0.97,4847.342,4848.543,Absolutely.,94,,
784,0.97,4848.543,4850.745,"Okay, colleagues.",94,,
785,0.97,4850.745,4852.514,That concludes these two a items.,94,,
786,0.97,4852.514,4856.117,"Council member Lewis, you're welcome to state throughout the whole meeting.",94,,
787,0.97,4856.117,4860.956,But you are also free to go as the alternate.,94,,
788,0.97,4860.956,4863.225,If you wish to move on with your day.,94,,
789,0.97,4863.225,4867.729,"That is totally, totally fine.",94,,
790,0.97,4867.729,4868.563,Thank you.,95,,
791,0.97,4868.563,4872.1,I think I will leave given that all five members are present.,95,,
792,0.97,4872.1,4872.467,Absolutely.,96,,
793,0.97,4872.467,4872.634,Yep.,96,,
794,0.97,4872.634,4873.235,Totally understandable.,96,,
795,0.97,4873.235,4875.27,"Thank you so much, council member Lewis.",96,,
796,0.97,4875.27,4875.604,Thank you.,97,,
797,0.97,4875.604,4881.142,And thank you to Carina and to Beth.,98,,
798,0.97,4881.142,4885.547,You are also welcome to leave the committee meeting if you need to do so.,98,,
799,0.97,4885.547,4891.486,Thank you so much to both of you for being with us once again.,98,,
800,0.97,4891.486,4892.387,Okay.,98,,
801,0.97,4892.387,4902.063,So the last agenda item is agenda item 4. and I would ask that the clerk please read agenda item 4 into the record.,98,,
802,0.97,4902.063,4905.467,"Agenda item 4, resolution 311933.",99,,
803,0.97,4905.467,4912.507,A resolution exciting the requirement--company legislation.,99,,
804,0.97,4912.507,4920.315,Also considers impact of climate change for the city of Seattle.,99,,
805,0.97,4920.315,4921.116,"For briefing, discussion, and P.",99,,
806,0.97,4921.483,4924.619,Thank you so much.,100,,
807,0.97,4925.954,4939.935,"Colleagues, this is the only agenda item on today's agenda that will require a vote of the committee in order to advance the resolution to full council.",100,,
808,0.97,4939.935,4942.537,I understand that we have the base resolution.,100,,
809,0.97,4942.537,4945.34,And we also have a substitute version of the resolution.,100,,
810,0.97,4945.34,4959.02,"So once we have heard all of the presentations and have discussion, we need to go through some procedural steps to get the substitute before the committee.",100,,
811,0.97,4959.02,4963.925,And ultimately voting on advancing the substitute's version of the resolution.,100,,
812,0.97,5045.673,5078.473,"After conversations with some of your offices, our Council's central staff, environmental advocates, including Dr. Tuttle, and the directors of the city budget office, offices of Sustainability and environment, we've circulated and posted a streamlined substitute resolution that removes all the additional financial reporting recommends so that now the substitute resolution that you'll Ideally move forward on focuses just on the two climate questions added to the summary and fiscal note.",100,,
813,0.97,5078.473,5081.142,"Last month, King County updated its climate plan.",100,,
814,0.97,5081.142,5090.351,"And like the resolution before you today, it Drooptly addresses carbon emissions and adaptation or resiliency to climate change.",100,,
815,0.97,5090.351,5096.791,King County's progress is a powerful reminder that city hall can also do more to address climate change now.,100,,
816,0.97,5096.791,5102.797,And we have this resolution 31933 to do something more.,100,,
817,0.97,5102.797,5110.104,Specifically to update the summary fiscal NOTE template so we view each piece of city legislation through a climate lens.,100,,
818,0.97,5110.104,5114.609,How will it impact climate change?,100,,
819,0.97,5114.609,5115.677,Specifically Emipgzs and resiliency.,100,,
820,0.97,5115.677,5123.451,Just asking these two questions on emissions and adaptation will provide Council members with a more comprehensive piece of information when making legislative decisions.,100,,
821,0.97,5127.555,5129.224,Happy to answer questions.,101,,
822,0.97,5129.224,5133.194,And of course we have Lisa Cay and Van noble here as well.,101,,
823,0.97,5133.194,5133.561,Thank you.,101,,
824,0.97,5133.561,5137.499,"Thank you so much, council member Pedersen, for those introductory remarks.",102,,
825,0.97,5137.499,5157.785,Lisa do you want to go ahead and describe the substitute bill and the changes and all of those things?,102,,
826,0.97,5157.785,5166.928,"As members of the committee know, council's rule require that all majority and resolution.",103,,
827,0.97,5166.928,5174.669,Executive staff prepared these notes for the Mayor's transmitted legislation.,103,,
828,0.97,5174.669,5176.171,And central staff for Council initiative legislation.,103,,
829,0.97,5176.171,5190.351,"So as you heard in the original title for resolution, as introduced, it would have modified the template by adding a new section on environmental climate.",103,,
830,0.97,5190.351,5195.49,A new subsection pertaining to financial documents.,103,,
831,0.97,5195.49,5198.66,Or certain types of capital projects.,103,,
832,0.97,5198.66,5199.194,Bear with me.,103,,
833,0.97,5199.194,5206.601,I'm going to see if I can share my screen.,103,,
834,0.97,5206.601,5214.075,So many things I can share.,103,,
835,0.97,5214.075,5221.015,"Yep, we can see it.",104,,
836,0.97,5221.015,5230.225,"What I'm sharing with you, is a full version of the substitute resolution.",105,,
837,0.97,5230.225,5235.129,The substitute would still add these questions to the template.,105,,
838,0.97,5235.129,5241.302,"And focused questions about what climate emissions impacts, and the resiliency in climate change.",105,,
839,0.97,5247.642,5253.047,The substitute resolution--I'll just Enumerate a couple of the other changes.,106,,
840,0.97,5253.047,5264.659,"It would also require all departments and offices to use the revised NOTE by January 1st, 2021, instead of right away.",106,,
841,0.97,5264.659,5270.632,It shifts the due date for implementation from December 31st 2020 to March 31st 2021.,106,,
842,0.97,5270.632,5288.249,And finally it would not--the substitute would not require central staff to revise the summary fiscal note to request legislation to be adopted from civil staff in having discussions about how to best accomplish it.,106,,
843,0.97,5288.249,5309.771,"In terms of the impact, as with the introduced version of the resolution, implementation would require additional staff funds, training, and assistance to complete the emission and climate change impact questions.",106,,
844,0.97,5309.771,5325.153,"To conclusion of environmental requirement and emission section could directly support the city's reference to the environmental justice pool, such as projecting communities vulnerable to climate change impact.",106,,
845,0.97,5329.757,5331.826,"Great, thank you.",107,,
846,0.97,5331.826,5332.627,So much.,107,,
847,0.97,5332.627,5338.132,"Colleague, any questions for Lisa at this juncture?",107,,
848,0.97,5338.132,5338.933,Not seeing any.,107,,
849,0.97,5338.933,5339.534,"Director noble, welcome.",107,,
850,0.97,5339.534,5342.537,Please.,107,,
851,0.97,5342.537,5344.539,Thank you.,108,,
852,0.97,5344.539,5348.409,Just a brief comment to express executives' full support for this.,108,,
853,0.97,5348.409,5349.51,A welcomed change.,108,,
854,0.97,5349.51,5352.146,"The event in the moment, obviously speaks to importance of it.",108,,
855,0.97,5352.146,5354.949,But we all know more broadly than that.,108,,
856,0.97,5354.949,5364.926,"The events of decades in the past, and looking forward that make it an essential piece of careful policy consideration and analysis.",108,,
857,0.97,5364.926,5369.23,Had an opportunity to work with Council member Pedersen and the central staff on the changes.,108,,
858,0.97,5369.23,5371.499,"Again, looking 4Ed implementing it.",108,,
859,0.97,5380.208,5381.075,Forward to implementing it.,108,,
860,0.97,5381.376,5381.843,Great.,109,,
861,0.97,5382.844,5385.38,"Thank you so much, director noble, for being with us today.",109,,
862,0.97,5385.38,5390.184,And making sure there is support on the executive side to also help out with this of course.,109,,
863,0.97,5390.184,5393.955,That's important because legislation comes not just from the Council but also from the executive side.,109,,
864,0.97,5393.955,5400.194,So we really do appreciate it.,109,,
865,0.97,5400.194,5400.495,Okay.,109,,
866,0.97,5400.495,5406.567,"Colleagues, any other questions for Lisa from the Council central staff or for Council member Pedersen?",109,,
867,0.97,5406.567,5412.707,Or any comments that anybody would like to make about the proposed resolution?,109,,
868,0.97,5412.707,5419.48,"Again, there are several procedural steps we're gonNA have to go through tow get the substitute before us.",109,,
869,0.97,5419.48,5439.901,"Before we go through those more mundane detail, I want to afford folks an opportunity to speak more generally about the concepts articulated by Council member Pedersen, the legislative intent, I should say, S that was articulated by Council member Pedersen and that is reflected in this resolution.",109,,
870,0.97,5439.901,5451.112,"Council member Mosqueda, and any others who would like to speak, let me know.",109,,
871,0.97,5451.112,5461.522,Thank you very much.,110,,
872,0.97,5461.823,5476.838,Section that call out the potential impacts and intersections of carbon emissions and injustices due to racism and so inequities.,110,,
873,0.97,5476.838,5488.683,"We also know that climate change disproportionately impacts black, indigenous and minority groups.",110,,
874,0.97,5488.683,5493.988,So we're considering climate justice and not just climate impact.,110,,
875,0.97,5493.988,5499.493,Skinning that's an important and I think that's an important distinction.,110,,
876,0.97,5499.493,5503.664,We've also added a prompt of climate just of not implementing certain policies and projects.,110,,
877,0.97,5503.664,5509.604,And I think that helps us get a long way toward our end goal which is a more dynamic fiscal note.,110,,
878,0.97,5509.604,5512.974,This was not something that's unique to just the city of Seattle.,110,,
879,0.97,5512.974,5517.511,But fiscal notes in general are generally not Tinammic in looking at only the cost of Comblemation.,110,,
880,0.97,5517.511,5521.849,And it's important to look at the cost and consequences of not implementing policy as well.,110,,
881,0.97,5521.849,5527.622,So I appreciate that.,110,,
882,0.97,5527.622,5556.951,"What I wanted to ask, council member Pedersen, recognizing there are some policies we put forward that have Nonsignificant climate impacts, and attempting such an analysis that we have outline leader in the amendments in front of us would require central staff to rely on speculation or insufficient data in certain circumstances and wanting to avoid any unintended consequences that may arise from sup an analysis on policies that are not necessarily climate justice or climate impact.",110,,
883,0.97,5556.951,5562.556,What is the intent for reporting requirements for the policies or projects?,110,,
884,0.97,5562.556,5566.36,"For example, like a labor policy comes from mind.",110,,
885,0.97,5566.36,5567.628,Minimum wage or secure scheduling.,110,,
886,0.97,5567.628,5579.307,How would staff be required to report on these policies that don't directly have a significant impact on climate justice?,110,,
887,0.97,5579.307,5583.878,I say that and recognize we should probably be thinking with climate justice if every policy we do.,110,,
888,0.97,5583.878,5590.651,"But for the sake of our staff's time, how do they respond when there's not a nexus there?",110,,
889,0.97,5590.651,5594.422,"If that's appropriate, Madame chair, from Council member Pedersen.",110,,
890,0.97,5594.422,5595.69,Of course.,111,,
891,0.97,5595.69,5598.326,"Council member Pedersen, I think that question was directed at you.",111,,
892,0.97,5598.326,5601.495,And you're welcome to provide a response.,111,,
893,0.97,5601.495,5602.697,"Thank you, Council President.",112,,
894,0.97,5602.697,5604.999,"Thank you for the question, council member to Skweda.",112,,
895,0.97,5604.999,5608.769,"As chair of the Finance Committee, I know the fiscal NOTE is very important to you as well.",112,,
896,0.97,5608.769,5610.071,That's a really good question.,112,,
897,0.97,5610.071,5627.521,"If it has nothing to do with climate, just as with other questions in this section of the fiscal note, called the other implications, it is appropriate in a lot of cases to say that it's not applicable.",112,,
898,0.97,5627.521,5642.036,"And simply by addressing the questions, thinking through the questions, the point here is to be more mindful in a consistent way about climate.",112,,
899,0.97,5642.036,5651.846,And viewing things through this lens.,112,,
900,0.97,5651.846,5656.417,"And hooking through it and concluding Thattit not applicable, that is fine for us.",112,,
901,0.97,5656.417,5664.558,Thank you so much for that clarification.,113,,
902,0.97,5664.558,5668.796,Having the option for central staff to just say not applicable in this situation helps.,113,,
903,0.97,5668.796,5691.786,"And I'll just say so I don't have to come off mute again, Council President, I think that it is really important for us to take a look at each of the policies that we are looking at.",113,,
904,0.97,5698.059,5709.637,However the climate benefit of having dense House nearing transit so folks don't have to rely on cars to get around is sometimes sort of juxtaposed with whether or not we should be building anymore.,113,,
905,0.97,5709.637,5742.937,"And I think this is a great example of us being able to look at every policy, for example if housing to, show that if we don't continue to build affordable housing throughout the city, there's not just an impact of not doing that or not spending that money this year Fwushgs has a much longer impact on our globe and local environment when we continue to push people out of the city by not building affordable housing.",113,,
906,0.97,5742.937,5750.778,I'll just put that plug in to say thank you as a good example of how we can apply this in real life.,113,,
907,0.97,5750.778,5752.279,And also folks for Jump-Start.,113,,
908,0.97,5752.279,5754.748,With new housing environments we're making through Jump-Start.,113,,
909,0.97,5754.748,5759.22,"That housing will be built free of fossil fuel use, 100% electrified.",113,,
910,0.97,5759.22,5767.561,And I want to thank the folks who testified today for helping make that possible in addition to our partners in the labor community who worked on that effort in the Jump-Start bill.,113,,
911,0.97,5767.561,5769.563,Looking forward to supporting this.,113,,
912,0.97,5769.563,5773.734,And thanks again for letting me ask that clarifying question.,113,,
913,0.97,5773.734,5774.368,Of course.,114,,
914,0.97,5774.368,5790.851,"Thank you so much, council member Mosqueda for that line of questioning.",114,,
915,0.97,5790.851,5796.891,"There have been remarks indicating that there aren't X, Y, Z impacts in that category.",114,,
916,0.97,5796.891,5803.297,So I certainly appreciate the concern around undue delays and N legislation by either us or the executive.,114,,
917,0.97,5803.297,5812.606,In terms of working with legislation if there is a sense of feeling like they've gotTA come up with something.,114,,
918,0.97,5812.606,5815.476,So I do appreciate the flexibility.,114,,
919,0.97,5815.476,5817.344,"Colleagues, any other questions or comments?",114,,
920,0.97,5817.344,5819.914,"Council member Strauss, please.",114,,
921,0.97,5819.914,5821.615,"Thank you, Council President.",115,,
922,0.97,5821.615,5825.686,Council member Pedersen for bringing this forward.,115,,
923,0.97,5825.686,5833.961,It is inherent that we make all of our policy decisions under the climate crisis and how we are addressing this crisis.,115,,
924,0.97,5833.961,5834.562,This is invaluable.,115,,
925,0.97,5834.562,5843.404,I think there are additional steps that I'd love to work with you on about making this part of not only our fiscal analysis.,115,,
926,0.97,5843.404,5859.42,"Also just our general policy analysis and a plug for needing to put all the needs, a select Committee on the climate crisis, as we know our everyday actions are contributing in ways that may not be reversible.",115,,
927,0.97,5859.42,5862.256,If we do not take immediate action now.,115,,
928,0.97,5862.256,5864.325,Thank you for bringing that to the forefront.,115,,
929,0.97,5864.325,5866.76,And I look forward to voting for it.,115,,
930,0.97,5866.76,5873.133,And thank you for making the substantive changes to really focus this on just the climate crisis.,115,,
931,0.97,5873.133,5877.371,"Thank you so much, council member Strauss for those comments.",116,,
932,0.97,5877.371,5878.572,Really do appreciate it.,116,,
933,0.97,5878.572,5887.648,Are there any other comments or questions before we go through the procedural steps of getting the substitute before us?,116,,
934,0.97,5887.648,5889.55,And I think there's some amendments.,116,,
935,0.97,5889.55,5894.889,There's a lot of procedural steps we're gonNA go through right now.,116,,
936,0.97,5894.889,5896.457,Any other questions or comments?,116,,
937,0.97,5896.457,5896.991,Great.,116,,
938,0.97,5896.991,5898.425,I'm not seeing any.,116,,
939,0.97,5898.425,5904.465,"So Council member Pedersen, I just wanted to say thank you as well.",116,,
940,0.97,5904.465,5910.17,Our office has worked really well on streamlining some of the questions here.,116,,

942,0.97,5913.274,5933.027,"It is Serendipitous, I suppose, that we are about to vote on a resolution related to climate change on the day in which Seattle's world ranking today is to have the second worst air quality in the world.",116,,
943,0.97,5933.027,5943.17,As a result of the Wildfires in Oregon and California and in our own state.,116,,
944,0.97,5943.17,5967.394,I really do appreciate this opportunity to take a small but significant step forward in making sure that we're at Leasting intentional and aware at Leasting intentional and aware of asking ourselves how these policies positively or negatively impacts our efforts in the space of climate justice and climate change.,116,,
945,0.97,5967.394,5969.463,So I'm looking forward to supporting this resolution as well.,116,,
