15,0.97,39.439,40.54,"Thanks for being on time, folks.",12,,
16,0.97,40.54,46.713,We have to go through the process of suspending the rules once again.,12,,
17,0.97,46.713,69.836,"The Councilmembers are silent, allowing electronic Parps at briefing meetings to continue participating remotely, I'll continue to suspend the Council rules through July 1ST, 2020, to allow the meeting to continue through electronic means, if there is no objection, the Council rules will be suspended to allow electronic participation through July 1ST, 2020.",12,,
18,0.97,69.836,87.487,"Hearing no objection, the Council rules are suspended and Council briefing meetings will be held with Councilmembers participating through July 1ST, 2020.",12,,

24,0.97,101.501,105.004,"Hearing no objection, the minutes are adopted.",14,,
25,0.97,105.004,114.948,"President's report, I do not have anything to report this morning so we'll just go ahead and jump into the preview of today's city council actions, Council, and regional committees.",14,,
26,0.97,114.948,128.361,"Also, just want to let the record reflect that we have been joined by Councilmember Strauss and Councilmember Herbold, welcome.",14,,
27,0.97,128.361,128.695,Good morning.,14,,
28,0.97,128.695,133.733,We'll begin the next discussion on Council and regional committees.,14,,
29,0.97,133.733,143.71,I'll call on Council members on roll call for city council meetings designated by last time and with the Council President being called upon last.,14,,
30,0.97,143.71,149.616,This week's roll call rotation begins with Council Sawant.,14,,
31,0.97,149.616,153.453,She is not able to join us this morning.,14,,
32,0.97,153.453,161.995,"She does send her regrets, but we will Miss her this morning during Council briefings.",14,,
33,0.97,161.995,165.732,She does plan to be with us at 2:00 today.,14,,
34,0.97,165.732,176.109,"The roll call will be Council Strauss, Herbold, Juarez, Lewis, Mosqueda, Pedersen and I'll conclude the agenda discussion.",14,,
35,0.97,176.109,189.889,"We don't have any other briefings or executive sessions scheduled for today, so it will just be our reports, so with that being said, let's go ahead and get started.",14,,
36,0.97,189.889,191.524,"Councilmember Strauss, the floor is yours.",14,,
37,0.97,191.524,192.825,"Thank you, Council President.",15,,
38,0.97,192.825,196.996,"I want to thank my colleagues, it is great to see you all today.",15,,
39,0.97,196.996,225.692,Last week we were able to attend the Association of Washington city's legislative priorities committee where we were joined by a Senator with a robust discussion about police accountability and revenue and all of the different items coming before the state Legislature this year and really want to thank Kent heel from the city of University place for his comments last week.,15,,
40,0.97,225.692,236.903,"Also, last week, I was able to celebrate Juneteenth with a rally and March.",15,,
41,0.97,236.903,244.978,We started at a park I grew up playing soccer and baseball in and I was able to meet the King of nor way both times.,15,,
42,0.97,244.978,250.483,"He came to dedicate the mural, once when I was in third grade and once in 2015.",15,,
43,0.97,250.483,257.59,It was nice to see the community show up to celebrate Juneteenth and support black lives in our community.,15,,
44,0.97,257.59,289.222,"One of the things we talked about during the rally was white silence and really wanted to--I'll share my comments with you here and now, which is that here in America, our communication styles and communication patterns demonstrate the silence means agreement and so as compared to other countries and cultures where silence actually means disagreement, so that is the difference between our country and other countries.",15,,
45,0.97,289.222,315.314,"Our country, silence does mean agreement, so when we are seeing violence perpetrated against black lives here in our country, for white people, our silence is complicit in this aggression and so that is where, especially in times like this, and so that is when you see signs that see white silence equals violence, that is where this is coming from.",15,,
46,0.97,315.314,366.999,"In moments like this when white folk are silent, during times of aggression and violence against black people, our silence is complicit and in agreement with this violence, so it really is our duty, having conversations with each other, everyone has a different Lane that they want to--that they feel comfortable participating in and I think it is also really important to remember that a lot of this work is uncomfortable and that part of this work is--and so wanted to share with you some of of the thoughts I shared with crowds of, at minimum, 500, and I think there were more like 1,000 people marching from West woodland down to Ballard.",15,,
47,0.97,366.999,373.072,I wanted to thank Marcus and all of the organizers that made it happen.,15,,
48,0.97,373.072,374.107,It was a professional event.,15,,
49,0.97,374.107,381.814,My office has still been working with small businesses helping them navigate the different levels of resources available.,15,,
50,0.97,381.814,388.02,That is one reason why I am so excited for the jump start Seattle proposal.,15,,
51,0.97,388.02,402.268,"I have signed on as a co-sponsor in part because this stimulus program, what we know is that when we only have budgets that we don't--the whole city doesn't succeed.",15,,
52,0.97,402.268,412.178,We are still trying to get back to funding levels of service from 2008 and so we know that there needs to be a new revenue source.,15,,
53,0.97,412.178,417.15,We know we can't continue to rely on sales tax for obvious reasons.,15,,
54,0.97,417.15,420.052,Property taxes are also not a good option.,15,,
55,0.97,420.052,433.266,"I know some people, my friends parents are paying property tax that are similar to the original mortgage and so we really need to have a new and Progressive revenue source.",15,,
56,0.97,433.266,443.042,"I'm very excited for how this proposal supports small businesses in particular, supports immigrants and refugees and child care.",15,,
57,0.97,443.042,461.093,"It is really, and also provides enough time for businesses to be able to understand if they fall into this category of being taxed or not, and also, doesn't tax necessarily on 2019 revenues which will be different than 2020 revenues.",15,,
58,0.97,461.093,472.638,"I think that the timing of this proposal is very good and I'm excited, you know it is already a fine tuned proposal and I'm looking forward to how we can fine tune it further.",15,,
59,0.97,472.638,478.244,"Want to thank everyone for their time and Council President, that is my report.",15,,
60,0.97,478.244,481.247,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss for that report.",16,,
61,0.97,481.247,489.488,"Any questions or comments on that report, colleagues?",16,,
62,0.97,489.488,490.423,Okay.,16,,
63,0.97,490.423,525.324,"Thank you again and really appreciate your ongoing participation in the national and local conversations related to Anti-Racism work, Councilmember Strauss, I really appreciate you being so forward with the work that you're doing in your district and personally to, as a white male, to look deeper at these issues and really rise to the occasion to accept the call to do Anti-Racist work.",16,,
64,0.97,525.324,528.728,I appreciate your consistent dedication to doing that work.,16,,
65,0.97,528.728,539.138,It is hard work and needs to be sustained by white allies for sure.,16,,
66,0.97,539.138,542.041,"Next up we'll hear from Councilmember Herbold, please.",16,,
67,0.97,542.041,543.809,Thank you.,17,,
68,0.97,543.809,561.727,I want to first just start with a recognition that we have experienced the tragic loss of another young black man's life just days after his high school graduation.,17,,
69,0.97,561.727,582.815,"We know that there was another shooting as well last night and the result of two nights of shootings are two people injured and, again, one very young man's loss of life.",17,,
70,0.97,582.815,593.726,I believe that grieving family members and friends deserve to know whether or not this young man's death could have been prevented.,17,,
71,0.97,593.726,598.13,If Seattle fire Department medics would have been able to respond to calls for help.,17,,
72,0.97,598.13,625.291,"We know a little bit more information about the operations of the fire Department and the police Department from Saturday night from information that both police and fire had released, including body worn camera Video and CAD data information.",17,,
73,0.97,625.291,636.702,And there is also more live Video streaming information out there about the Saturday morning shooting.,17,,
74,0.97,636.702,663.729,"You know, fire Department medics were ready to enter but given there had been a shooting and armed individuals within the perimeter, the policy for the police Department is--or the policy for the fire Department is that the police Department has to secure the area first in advance and this is the fire Department's policy all across the board, not just in this instance.",17,,
75,0.97,663.729,668.334,Medics are focused on giving care to a patient.,17,,
76,0.97,668.334,675.241,They're more vulnerable than people who can focus on the actions of individuals in a crowd.,17,,
77,0.97,675.241,684.784,This goes for whether or not fire medics are giving emergency care in a Dv situation or in a car accident where people are arguing about the fault of an accident.,17,,
78,0.97,684.784,695.361,The fire Department always waits for the police Department in an instance where there is violence or potential for violence.,17,,
79,0.97,695.361,719.919,"Now, we know that the police Department early on said that it was a violent crowd that prevented the officers' safe access to the victims and have sort of walked that back a little bit and instead are now referring to the same language that you can find officers use themselves in the CAD data documents.",17,,
80,0.97,719.919,724.757,The officers themselves did not say that the crowd was violent.,17,,
81,0.97,724.757,750.382,"They used the term extremely hostile, so putting that aside all together, I just want to say that the suggestion that the crowd interfered with the access to victims I believe defies belief because the first victim had already been transferred by the time the police arrived and the second victim hadn't been shot yet.",17,,
82,0.97,750.382,756.455,I really reject the narrative that it was the mood at the crowd that prevented SPD from reaching the victims.,17,,
83,0.97,756.455,773.072,Victims were already gone and it is clear to me that a situation that requires people in need of medical care to be escorted to the perimeter of the chop to get help isn't in anyone's best interest.,17,,
84,0.97,773.072,782.648,"That is the operational plan that the fire Department is using right now, that people inside the C. H. O. P. that need medical care need to be escorted to the perimeter of the C. H. O.",17,,
85,0.97,782.648,782.848,P ..,17,,
86,0.97,782.848,798.864,I really don't think that that is a sustainable ongoing operational approach that we can count on being able to help people.,17,,
87,0.97,798.864,805.538,The CAD data and video suggest that the police Department wasn't on site until about 18 minutes after the shooting.,17,,
88,0.97,805.538,825.925,"The fire Department was in place a block away waiting for the police Department's clearance, and we don't know whether, if SPD had arrived earlier and fire had been cleared to respond, whether or not this young man--this young man's life would have been saved.",17,,
89,0.97,825.925,845.177,Interviews with volunteer medics indicate that the volunteer medics requested a 24/7 Department liaison and that health one offered to be stationed at Harvard and pine to facilitate extraction of people needing emergency care.,17,,
90,0.97,845.177,852.117,"The emergency medics don't have the two things and again, I don't know, sort of, where those requests are.",17,,
91,0.97,852.117,892.958,"I know that C. H. O. P. leaders have been meeting in recognition that this is not a sustainable situation in the light of the tragic loss of life and critical injuries, and in particular, I understand that the discussion is centering around the presence of large numbers of people, including guns at night, and how that remains to be a barrier to fire Department response and, you know, the guns are not present during the day and that has been very helpful, and so I'm hopeful that the decision making body of C. H. O. P.",17,,
92,0.97,892.958,902.501,Leaders are centering their decisions about what comes next as allies in the voices of black C. H. O. P. leaders.,17,,
93,0.97,902.501,913.479,"It is black people who die, whether or not from gun violence like we saw this weekend, police violence, or a myriad of other health emergencies that black people suffer at a disproportionate rate.",17,,
94,0.97,913.479,918.183,It is no different in the six block area that is the C. H. O.,17,,
95,0.97,918.183,925.09,"P. and emergency, life saving services must be able to reach people who live, work, and visit there.",17,,
96,0.97,925.09,946.979,"I have heard just this morning from the Mayor's office, that, and this is consistent with reports that we see in the press today, but that the Mayor's office believes that the nighttime situation is unstable and that something needs to change.",17,,
97,0.97,946.979,950.115,They're meeting with Andre Taylor and several C. H. O. P.,17,,
98,0.97,950.115,959.191,"Organizers to talk about a path forward and then based on the outcome of that meeting, they will have updates to announce.",17,,
99,0.97,959.191,972.504,"They go on to tell--the Mayor's office goes on to give me a heads up that there is a statement from their office that will be going out shortly about the C. H. O. P. meeting, which is happening later this A.M.",17,,
100,0.97,972.504,978.944,And I will certainly share this information with you all when I receive it.,17,,
101,0.97,978.944,985.751,"I have a committee meeting tomorrow morning, a public safety and human services committee.",17,,
102,0.97,985.751,994.393,This was a rescheduled date from a committee meeting that we had tried to have a couple of weeks ago.,17,,
103,0.97,994.393,997.796,"The items on the agenda, there are two items.",17,,
104,0.97,997.796,1021.12,"One is the office of approximately police accountability's 2019 annual report and update on current investigations and the other is the office of the inspector general's 2019 annual report and their update on the sent national event review of recent, mass demonstration response by the police Department.",17,,
105,0.97,1021.12,1039.605,The Office of the inspector General is under taking a sent National review of recent mass demonstration response by the police Department and they are leading this review centered in a community process.,17,,
106,0.97,1039.605,1052.151,Sent national event review is a system's base root cause analysis of incidents with significant negative outcomes that are important and of concern to the community.,17,,
107,0.97,1052.151,1068.734,"The goal of this review is systematic improvement and the office of the inspector General is seeking to ensure that, again, that it is grounded in community priorities and perspective and also inform by law enforcement and relevant subject matter experts.",17,,
108,0.97,1068.734,1075.808,The focus is on system improvement that addresses specifically institutional racism.,17,,
109,0.97,1075.808,1091.256,"The Office of the inspector General will partner with the community police Commission and other community stake holders to perspectives, input and questions from the community concerning response and mass demonstrations.",17,,
110,0.97,1091.256,1112.778,"This information gathering will be informed by many sources, including comments that we have heard from folks at public meetings, news coverage of events, complaints, and comments made directly to Oig and the OPA as well as up coming forums that will be announced in other Oig information gathering activities.",17,,
111,0.97,1112.778,1115.581,We'll hear more about that tomorrow in committee.,17,,
112,0.97,1115.581,1145.377,"Also just want to let folks know that the questions that Council submitted, a few weeks ago now, after the original actions at the police Department, they are almost complete with answering those questions, so folks know there were 110 questions all together.",17,,
113,0.97,1145.377,1174.673,"I had been seeking too have the police Department come and review with the public safety services Committee, the responses to those questions, and I understand that the Mayor's office has asked that the police Department not speak specifically to the answers that have been provided because of concerns about known and possible litigation.",17,,
114,0.97,1174.673,1203.769,"I'm going to check with the law Department on whether or not they share those concerns, but in any event, I will certainly, whether or not we hear them and have a discussion with SPD, presenting the answers to the questions in committee aside, I will ensure that everybody on the Council receives a copy just as soon as I receive them and I expect to receive them within the next 24 hours.",17,,
115,0.97,1203.769,1271.536,"On the human services side of my Department, just, again, they're doing a lot of really important work addressing Covid-19 impacts, specifically related to aging and disability services, their population, as we all know, falls squarely within the high-risk categories of Covid-19, so social isolation is a big problem for older people in the best of times and much worse during Covid-19, so aging and disability services and partners are really focusing a lot of their efforts now on addressing social isolation, including working to print cards for food and meal deliveries that promote what is called community link connections and Aarp's friendly voices service and for anybody out there listening who is either an older adult or a care giver or has somebody they love that is an older adult, you can call community living connections to access their resources.",17,,
116,0.97,1271.536,1281.413,All calls are free and confidential and can be reached at 1-844-348-5464.,17,,
117,0.97,1281.413,1290.689,Friendly voices ARRANGES calls between older adults and trained Aarp volunteers for social connection.,17,,
118,0.97,1290.689,1314.546,"And then ads, specifically through age friendly Seattle, offers a weekly Online program at either a virtual civic coffee hour or a new series called close to home, the live events are fully auto Captioned in English and six other languages.",17,,
119,0.97,1314.546,1337.135,"They have the Caption options and just want to recognize that ads has worked with the Pike market senior center, the Seattle channel and other senior centers and organizations to develop ten, one hour programs for seniors called age wise TV Premiering on Thursday, June 25th at 1:00 P.M ..",17,,
120,0.97,1337.135,1350.048,Really appreciate the big focus that the human services Department is doing on the needs of our Elders in dealing with the challenges associated with social distancing.,17,,
121,0.97,1350.048,1360.459,"And we all know, as it relates to public health, we have moved to phase two of the governor's four step plan to open safely.",17,,
122,0.97,1360.459,1384.816,"Businesses are required to follow special guidance such as limiting the number of people that can be inside at once and we have been able to do that because King County has been able to increase testing, our Healthcare system is not over taxed, and a lot of that is because residents have been doing a good job of voluntary complying with social and physical distancing guidelines.",17,,
123,0.97,1384.816,1401.733,I just want to let folks know that I have been following the fact that a lot of cities and States are beginning to turn their guidance about mask wearing into regulations and law.,17,,
124,0.97,1401.733,1444.776,"We have been talking to Seattle King County public health about whether or not we should expect to see something stronger than guidance from the governor's office or King County public health and have expressed my interest in looking into whether or not we should do, like, many, many other cities have done, like the entire state of California has done and made face mask mandatory in certain types of public places, of course, with exceptions for people who can't wear masks.",17,,
125,0.97,1444.776,1460.225,The vision for that is not a law that is focused on enforcement but it is really focused on public education and so I'm continuing to have conversations with public health about that and we'll definitely keep you abreast.,17,,
126,0.97,1460.225,1466.765,"Wrapping up, I have office hours this weekend between 2:30 and 7:00.",17,,
127,0.97,1466.765,1489.12,"Last week I spoke at the next steps event on Friday, Juneteenth at the park and I want to note that at last week's community police Commission meeting we learned that interim executive director Bessie Scott announced she is resigning her position as well as the position as policy director.",17,,
128,0.97,1489.12,1491.857,Her last day will be early next month.,17,,
129,0.97,1491.857,1511.209,"She has been amazing for the city of Seattle and the community police Commission and has worked diligently with a lot of integrity to fulfill the mission of the organization and they will be very, very big shoes to fill.",17,,
130,0.97,1511.209,1531.963,"Other events coming up this week, I have the West Seattle bridge resources group June meeting and that is a group of large employers that S-Dot is meeting with to talk about bridge impacts, and then also on Wednesday, I have the West Seattle bridge community task force meeting.",17,,
131,0.97,1531.963,1533.198,That is all I have.,17,,
132,0.97,1533.198,1539.037,"Thank you, and I'm sorry, I was kind of a long report today.",17,,
133,0.97,1539.037,1540.605,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",18,,
134,0.97,1540.605,1551.583,Just want to address the issues around your public safety and human services committee meeting that is scheduled for tomorrow.,18,,
135,0.97,1551.583,1587.252,"Just as a reminder about the standards for exceptions for the city during the summer budget session, just wanted to remind folks that the resolution that we passed does suspend the committee calendar and States in a resolution that the special committee meetings can be called if a review of the legislative action can be required for a time if it is a quasi action with review or upon the approval of the Council President after consultation with the central staff director.",18,,
136,0.97,1587.252,1594.526,We want on in the memo to talk about the exceptions to the rule may be considered for critical time sensitive legislation.,18,,
137,0.97,1594.526,1606.571,Gave a little bit of an example as with relates to land use actions or proposed levies such as the Seattle transportation benefit district.,18,,
138,0.97,1606.571,1610.875,I recognize Councilmember Herbold that this is a meeting that was postponed.,18,,
139,0.97,1610.875,1648.313,"It was originally supposed to happen before we entered into the summer budget session, but just want to be mindful of the fact that I don't think that this meeting meets the standards that were set in the memo that I had set out previously, but I know you have already noticed the meeting and just want to sort of acknowledge that I'm sort of considering the reschedule--I'm sorry, I'm considering the scheduling of the public safety meeting as a reschedule of something that was previously scheduled.",18,,
140,0.97,1648.313,1669.134,"I don't think there are any other committee meetings that fall into that category at this point, but just want to remind folks that, you know, we need to be consistent here in terms of the application of that suspension of the committee calendar.",18,,
141,0.97,1669.134,1691.056,"This is one of those that probably does not meet the standard set in terms of exceptions for meetings but recognize that Councilmember Herbold has already scheduled the meeting and that this is in large part from her perspective, a redo of the meeting that was supposed to occur two weeks ago at this point.",18,,
142,0.97,1691.056,1709.607,Just wanted to make sure that I reminded all of us who are on the line of that particular exception as we move forward through the summer budget process.,18,,
143,0.97,1709.607,1716.881,"Colleagues, any other comments or questions for Councilmember Herbold on her report?",18,,
144,0.97,1716.881,1719.951,"I think I saw Councilmember Mosqueda, your hand went up.",18,,
145,0.97,1719.951,1721.519,I want to recognize you first.,18,,
146,0.97,1721.519,1739.671,"If there is anyone else either on the phone or the zoom call, who is interested in asking questions or making comments, let me know via text or through the raise your hand feature on zoom or just by giving me a visual Cue on the call.",18,,
147,0.97,1739.671,1741.873,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",18,,
148,0.97,1741.873,1743.608,"Thank you, Council President.",19,,
149,0.97,1743.608,1760.725,"Thank you, chair of public safety, Councilmember Herbold, for your comments this morning and due diligence to dig into the details and get information to share with the Council on the ongoing conversation about the protests and public safety up in the Capitol Hill neighborhood.",19,,
150,0.97,1760.725,1763.661,I appreciate your comments this morning.,19,,
151,0.97,1763.661,1764.362,They were very powerful.,19,,
152,0.97,1764.362,1790.889,"You mentioned some words about pushing back on the narrative that was used around why officers potentially didn't go in or why they weren't the first ones to respond to to the individual who needed assistance and I want to under score what you said and I agree, we want to make sure that firefighters and Emts have access to do their jobs and promote public safety and help those who need it.",19,,
153,0.97,1790.889,1791.756,That is critical.,19,,
154,0.97,1791.756,1799.464,"You mentioned, though, that the Seattle police Department's comments were that they couldn't enter because the folks were extremely hostile were the words you used.",19,,
155,0.97,1799.464,1803.368,"I heard a similar report this morning, I believe.",19,,
156,0.97,1803.368,1818.483,"The Video I saw showed people who were very upset about the individuals who were coming into the area having their guns drawn and I just heard people in the Video saying put your guns away, put your guns away.",19,,
157,0.97,1818.483,1821.419,I didn't have a chance to see or dig more into it.,19,,
158,0.97,1821.419,1830.962,Can you talk a little bit more about any of the analysis you saw or heard about what folks there were saying.,19,,
159,0.97,1830.962,1847.979,Were they saying put your guns away and pleading with them or can you explain between the disagreement of what the officers were saying and the experience of the folks in the area that were asking folks to put the guns away.,19,,
160,0.97,1847.979,1857.822,My comments focused on the police Department walking back the language that protesters were violent.,20,,
161,0.97,1857.822,1862.594,That was what had been reported earlier.,20,,
162,0.97,1862.594,1888.286,"Like I said, I reviewed the CAD data for how the officers themselves, what words they used, and the words they used were that protesters were extremely hostile and so I have been urging the police Department to not Editorialize on the words used by officers.",20,,
163,0.97,1888.286,1896.027,We can disagree about whether or not the protesters were hostile or not.,20,,
164,0.97,1896.027,1908.339,I think it is inappropriate for somebody in the role of drafting press statements to take words that say extremely hostile and turn them into violent.,20,,
165,0.97,1908.339,1910.008,Those words have completely different meanings.,20,,
166,0.97,1910.008,1914.579,That is really where I have been focusing my analysis.,20,,
167,0.97,1914.579,1936.1,"All of that, again, all of that aside, I think the larger point is the mood of the protesters had nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not the officers that were present were able to reach the victim, because the victim was already gone at that point.",20,,
168,0.97,1936.1,1948.179,"For me, that is the over arching point is by the time they got there, the victim was gone.",20,,
169,0.97,1948.179,1951.416,.,20,,
170,0.97,1951.416,1953.785,"Any follow up, Councilmember Mosqueda?",21,,
171,0.97,1953.785,1955.286,"No, thank you.",22,,
172,0.97,1955.286,1960.825,"I appreciate you digging into the questions, Councilmember Herbold.",22,,
173,0.97,1960.825,1967.965,Any other questions or comments on Councilmember Herbold's report?,23,,
174,0.97,1967.965,1970.234,Okay.,23,,
175,0.97,1970.234,1976.541,"Hearing none, we'll go ahead and move along the roll call here.",23,,

192,0.97,2077.909,2082.613,I know it doesn't sound like much but we get a lot of calls about lawn care.,24,,

194,0.97,2094.725,2108.139,"The department has experienced reduced staffing members as a result of the most vulnerable staff being unable to work in the field, health concerns and staggered shifts to reduce exposure.",24,,

201,0.97,2155.086,2168.966,"I know it has been difficult for them to get out everywhere to collect the garbage, to empty the Porta Potties, to make sure the hand washing stations are there and they're always concerned about the safety of their facilitate as they put them out in the field.",24,,

309,0.97,2954.084,2998.562,"It has been really encouraging to be getting thousands and thousands of E-Mails from my neighbors on uniformly in favor of repealing the ordinances and the fact that from my skim of my extremely crowded Inbox, almost all of these E-Mails appear to be completely unique and not form E-Mails which is something I haven't seen in the last six months to have thousands of completely unique E-Mails on an issue that Resonated so much from people who witnessed, felt, and seen the impact of these ordinances for a long time and I'm proud to stand with them and to be standing with my colleagues on the Council and taking a stand on those laws.",32,,

329,0.97,3207.938,3245.775,"I think it is long overdue to take a look at those laws that just create pathways for Unhelpful and unproductive contact with law enforcement that really does--those Loitering laws are not focused on a harm reduction, trauma informed approach and so we appreciate your willingness to bring the bills forward and look forward to the discussion this afternoon and look forward to being able to take a vote in favor of both of those bills.",33,,

335,0.97,3258.388,3267.23,I want to begin this morning by reminding our neighbors that there is still a deadly infection disease spreading in our community.,34,,
336,0.97,3267.23,3276.006,We are not meeting our targets for shrinking Covid-19--the Covid-19 outbreak in King County.,34,,
337,0.97,3276.006,3286.616,"I want to remind everybody to wash hands, physically distance, now that we're moving into phase two, we all have an eagerness, I know, to get out of the house.",34,,
338,0.97,3286.616,3303.967,It is still really important that we wear face masks to protect ourselves and our neighbors and continue to follow the public health guidelines about keeping ourselves safe and healthy.,34,,
339,0.97,3303.967,3309.506,There are no items on the agenda today from the community economic development committee.,34,,
340,0.97,3309.506,3317.347,I do want to acknowledge the work of King County equity now.,34,,
341,0.97,3317.347,3326.256,"On Juneteenth this past Friday, they organized a really important and meaningful event, focused on the need to reinvest in back communities.",34,,
342,0.97,3326.256,3370.934,"I took my 9-Year-Old daughter to the rally and March they had through the central area and made sure to explain to her, as we were getting an important history lesson from Rita green and others in the neighborhood who stopped along the way to share the history of the central area and share the significance of the development projects at particular intersections and to share, as we walked down the street, pointing out the names of families who still do or used to live on 23rd Avenue, in particular, businesses that used to be there that contributed to the vibrancy of the community, so I just want to give them a shout out.",34,,
343,0.97,3370.934,3383.78,It was a really special day and I appreciated it and I know everyone else who was there was also eager to hear that history if they didn't already know it.,34,,
344,0.97,3383.78,3395.458,"As the chair of the community economic development Committee, I support the effort to return property back to black ownership.",34,,
345,0.97,3395.458,3411.074,"During these Council discussions we're having about progressive revenue, I have been advocating for a permanent source of funding for the equitable development initiative because it is an important tool to increase access to capital for Community-Led development.",34,,
346,0.97,3411.074,3418.548,Bill that Councilmember Sawant and I--the amendment I was going to introduce would have provided $50 million for that initiative.,34,,
347,0.97,3418.548,3435.098,We will continue to discuss that as we move forward with the progressive revenue conversation and I expect that my colleagues will be interested in supporting that effort.,34,,
348,0.97,3435.098,3453.116,"Shifting to the conversation about the police Department, as we talk about how we shift resources from SPD back into the community, I do want to let folks know that we continue, my office continues to talk to Stakeholders about how best to provide support for the homeless neighbors.",34,,
349,0.97,3453.116,3486.95,"We'll be revising the previous bill to remove police from the navigation teams and we want to continue that conversation so we can use the resources to focus on rebuilding a more robust outreach infrastructure for the homeless neighbors and increase supportive housing options and so we, as we begin voting on the bill, on the budget for the city, I just want to give folks a heads up that that is something we'll be bringing forward.",34,,
350,0.97,3486.95,3503.166,"I also want to say that black and Brown communities in Seattle, especially organizations and leaders from my district have been asking for a long time for significant transformation in how we police our communities.",34,,
351,0.97,3503.166,3520.283,"As we begin those discussions around shifting resources away from the police Departent, I want to make sure that we're not taking anything off the table, especially as it relates to staffing and the tactics used by the police Department that mostly harm our black and Brown neighbors.",34,,
352,0.97,3520.283,3528.558,I had asked a few weeks ago what we could do about officers with long histories of complaints against them.,34,,
353,0.97,3528.558,3551.014,"It is troubling to read, as I did over the weekend, that some of those officers are also among the highest paid on the police force, so as we talk about how to shift resources into our communities, we'll be taking a hard look at how to reduce what we spend on salaries and how to advance the need to remove officers with a pattern of complaints.",34,,
354,0.97,3551.014,3559.088,I don't think we should be taking everything off the table at this point.,34,,
355,0.97,3559.088,3574.504,"As it relates to progressive revenue, I am sure Councilmember Mosqueda will make her announcement soon, but we have had a conversation over the last several days, Councilmember Sawant and I, Councilmember Mosqueda and I, about the two proposals.",34,,
356,0.97,3574.504,3582.845,I want to Lelt folks know I asked for two amendments to the jump start proposal.,34,,
357,0.97,3582.845,3591.854,One would allow a sunset clause only if other jurisdictions pass a progressive revenue package and Seattle would get a similar amount as the proposals would raise.,34,,
358,0.97,3591.854,3596.659,We're looking at how to substantially increase the revenue that would be generated by the jump start proposal.,34,,
359,0.97,3596.659,3597.727,We know it is possible.,34,,
360,0.97,3597.727,3621.15,"There is another proposal on the table already that would raise 500 million, so we know also that we have a giant hole in our budget that needs to be filled and so I'll be working with central staff to look at what changes in the tax rates that have been proposed will get us closer to the 500 million that is already on the table.",34,,
361,0.97,3621.15,3637.4,"I also want to let our neighbors know that last week the King County board of health, on which I sit, along with Councilmember Mosqueda and Lewis, voted to approve a resolution identifying racism as a public health crisis.",34,,
362,0.97,3637.4,3675.304,"We had a robust conversation about what that means and after the discussion, the board chair, County Council member Joe McDermott, created a subcommittee on the board of health in order to continue the conversation about what, besides just passing resolutions, the board of health should be doing to actively engage in the work of addressing racism as an Emide Emidemic.",34,,
363,0.97,3675.304,3676.272,The Roundtable will be meeting.,34,,
364,0.97,3676.272,3702.865,"The Columbus city business meeting is exploring how to hold, especially in light of Covid, how to hold meetings and learn about interventions to help keep our neighbors safe and the board of health sexual assault subcommittee will also be meeting later this week.",34,,
365,0.97,3702.865,3706.069,That is all I have.,34,,
366,0.97,3706.069,3706.369,Thank you.,34,,

372,0.97,3756.519,3777.74,"We have this legislation that is in front of us today on the full council agenda, as a reminder, we had a fumble hearing on this bill last Monday thanks to those who called in and also to the Council colleagues who provided comments, especially want to thank Councilmember Morales who spoke to the bill and importance of it and history of it, given it is in her district.",36,,
373,0.97,3777.74,3782.512,Thank you for your comments and our other Council colleagues.,36,,
374,0.97,3782.512,3812.675,"We're excited about the transfer of this piece of property and I want to thank all of the folks who have been working on this, including our legislative partners continuing to make this possible and under scoring the point made last Monday, that as we transfer this property, recognizing that this was previously good Union wage work, we want to make sure that we're investing in working families and creating good job opportunities and ongoing opportunities for the community so it continues to serve that public purpose.",36,,
375,0.97,3812.675,3818.714,"I think that is exactly what you heard when you heard the presentation about what was in the bill, including early learning facilities.",36,,

416,0.97,4109.839,4113.275,"Please, council colleagues, if you have issues you have not yet identified.",36,,
417,0.97,4113.275,4136.966,"This is a relatively new process for some, issue identification allows for all of us on Council and staff to know if you have potential amendments you want to work on, we want them flagged as early as possible so they can identify those in our Wednesday discussion and that allows us as a body to begin working on amendments.",36,,
418,0.97,4136.966,4147.343,We would ask Councilmembers to please submit those on central staff on Friday and that allows us to have an early heads up on any possible amendments we'll be working on.,36,,
419,0.97,4147.343,4157.386,"Thanks so much to central staff for their ongoing work and if you do have possible amendments that you're working on, ideally getting those in by Friday at 10:00 A.M.",36,,

423,0.97,4171.767,4178.14,Our understanding as of this morning is that the Mayor's office will be sending down their revised budget.,36,,
424,0.97,4178.14,4187.917,"Appreciate that we will be able to hear an over view from the city budget's office prior to doing that, we will also have public comment again.",36,,
425,0.97,4187.917,4201.03,We will have a briefing and discussion on follow up discussion after last week's inquest and the follow up on the type of calls that 911 is receiving.,36,,
426,0.97,4201.03,4217.446,A number of you did ask questions during the meeting last week and we received a handful of others from the viewing public about what type of calls our current system is responding to and getting that analysis will be helpful.,36,,
427,0.97,4217.446,4219.748,And then we'll have the over view.,36,,
428,0.97,4219.748,4225.921,"Other updates, as you saw, we had a public hearing that was originally scheduled for tomorrow night, June 23rd at 5:00 P.M ..",36,,
429,0.97,4225.921,4237.199,"This was the opportunity for us to have a block of time allocated to here and back from the Publc on questions, ideas, concerns, amendments they would like to see to the Mayor's proposed budget.",36,,
430,0.97,4237.199,4250.646,"Since we didn't have the budget in hand at the time, we did cancel tomorrow's evening public hearing, but we'll be rescheduling that given that we got word that the budget is potentially coming down, we'll be rescheduling that very soon.",36,,
431,0.97,4250.646,4254.149,Be on the look for us to schedule an evening public hearing.,36,,
432,0.97,4254.149,4277.406,This is an opportunity for us to have a large amount of time allocated to just hearing from the public and not having a presentation from our team or a robust discussion among Councilmember colleagues 30 is for the public's public to VI a large amount of time to allow us to benefit from hearing from them.,36,,
433,0.97,4277.406,4280.409,That will be rescheduled and will be sent out soon.,36,,

435,0.97,4282.411,4331.794,"I think that this has been really inspiring to think about how we create a light at the end of the tunnel for both providing immediate relief to Covid, council colleagues have commented on the increased numbers of Covid that are beginning to pop up again in counties around our region and wanting to be responsive to the ongoing needs for both working families and immigrants, refugees, small businesses, as we think about the immediate need for relief for those individuals and providing the opportunity for us to rebuild our local economy for small businesses, especially women and Minority-Owned businesses, creating opportunity for equitable development as discussed this morning and to really Reimagine what a new economy looks like as we emerge out of this recession in the out year.",36,,

448,0.97,4446.608,4446.909,I apologize.,38,,
449,0.97,4446.909,4457.586,"Councilmember Mosqueda, I wanted to get a little bit of a sense of clarification on the issue identification portion of your report as it relates to jump start Seattle.",38,,
450,0.97,4457.586,4473.569,Are you looking for issue identification on the spending plan and the revenue bills or are you focusing the issue identification in a particular Úway to create space about conversation about the revenue versus issue identification?,38,,
451,0.97,4473.569,4477.406,Can you talk a little bit more about that?,38,,
452,0.97,4477.406,4477.84,"Yes, thank you.",39,,
453,0.97,4477.84,4494.523,"I know that there have been most of the questions that we have received so far have been on Tweaks and potential changes to the spend side, so I think if folks have questions on the spend allocation, again, there is a 2020 spend and an out year spend.",39,,
454,0.97,4494.523,4499.294,"If you have questions about those, get those in as soon as you can.",39,,
455,0.97,4499.294,4503.632,"That allows for us to really, kind of, get all of the questions in one place.",39,,
456,0.97,4503.632,4513.509,"I do believe, if there is questions, and we can do issue identification this Wednesday on the revenue generating side for jump start as well, that will be helpful.",39,,
457,0.97,4513.509,4521.283,I expect most of the conversation for issue identification will really focus on the proposals.,39,,
458,0.97,4521.283,4524.152,"Thank you, Council President, good question.",39,,
459,0.97,4524.152,4524.419,Great.,40,,

478,0.97,4636.999,4647.776,Give subpoena power to the official independent over sight boards and redirect meaningful funding toward effective Community-Based alternates.,41,,

482,0.97,4681.61,4690.285,It will eliminate a source of disproportionate harm of people of color from the policing and Incarceration system.,41,,
483,0.97,4690.285,4700.629,"We hope for support for another positive, legislative step, a small one, that is all I have.",41,,

493,0.97,4725.987,4752.414,"So last week on June 18th, I and Councilmember Lewis attended the second meeting of the King County regional homelessness authority as representatives of the Seattle city council consistent with the Interlocal agreement that the city council approved last year.",42,,
494,0.97,4752.414,4774.736,I heard a couple of do not like us as elected officials.,42,,
495,0.97,4774.736,4786.982,They do not have staff and resources and infrastructure available to them to do some of the work the way you or I might do it or do in fact do it.,42,,
496,0.97,4786.982,4832.093,The experience group is continuing to highlight a structural inequity in how the regional homeless authority governing community is set up in so far as the fact that they don't have the same access to staffing resources and other resources that they need to be able to get up to speed on things like a mending the by laws or issues to the by laws and violating potential issues related to the Ila and any assortment of other issues that will be coming before the governing committee as we look toward implementing the regional homelessness authority model.,42,,
497,0.97,4832.093,4839.534,It is continuing to be highlighted as an issue.,42,,
498,0.97,4839.534,4868.863,"The experience group are all African-Americans and we continue to sort of lift up and I use my role on that, in the conversations to lift up the significant barriers that are being experienced by the folks to meaningfully continue to participate in the process without that infrastructure in place, and so the King County folks have committed themselves to addressing those issues in short order.",42,,
499,0.97,4868.863,4894.689,I do want to acknowledge and appreciate Mayor Durkan's offer to provide city support and resources and in order to make sure they will have the infrastructure they need to be able to meaningful participate and not be at an disadvantage as those who sit on the governing committee.,42,,
500,0.97,4894.689,4904.099,Most of the Cohort of lived experience folks on the committee felt comfortable with moving forward.,42,,

507,0.97,4949.477,4981.743,"They can go to Regionalhomelesssystem.Org and find more information about our past meeting or past two meetings and any presentations that we have received in the context of that word next up I wanted to talk really quickly about phase two here and the issues related to the fact that we're still in the public health crisis related to a highly infectious, potentially deadly disease that is called Covid-19.",42,,
508,0.97,4981.743,4983.878,And I appreciate Councilmember Morales bringing this up.,42,,
509,0.97,4983.878,4992.821,"It is really important for us to remember that even though we're moving as a county into phase two, that it does not mean we throw caution into the wind.",42,,
510,0.97,4992.821,4997.158,We still have to continue to exercise physical distancing.,42,,
511,0.97,4997.158,5026.221,"We have to continue to wear face coverings and masks and we have to continue to practice elevated hygiene standards when we're out in public so, again, folks, I know you all are excited to be out there again and potentially sit inside of a restaurant or a bar to have a beverage or eat food, but we are not beyond the Covid crisis.",42,,
512,0.97,5026.221,5047.642,"It is still very much present and with us and it is continuing to be a threat to our elder groups and I will say that much of the data coming out nationally, including here, is showing that people who are in their 30s and 40s are starting to experience hospitalization at a higher rate.",42,,
513,0.97,5047.642,5054.416,"Please, folks, continue to wear your masks to save other's lives and your own lives.",42,,
514,0.97,5054.416,5055.683,It is important we do this.,42,,
515,0.97,5055.683,5071.199,I also would be Remiss in not mentioning the fact that there is an extremely disproportionate impact on the Latin community as it relates to the spread of Covid-19.,42,,
516,0.97,5071.199,5083.144,"In my home County, Yakima County, it is quite literally the worst proportional infection rate on the West Coast.",42,,
517,0.97,5083.144,5085.447,This is where my elderly mother lives.,42,,
518,0.97,5085.447,5094.656,"It is where I continue to have many cousins, uncles, brothers, nieces and nephews live in Yakima County.",42,,
519,0.97,5094.656,5123.685,"I know that governor Inslee has just recently issued an order requiring face coverings and masks to be used in Yakima County as Councilmember Herbold continues to have her conversations with public health about that kind of a trend, a really want to make sure that we are approaching those kinds of policies here at home and across the state with a very strong racial equity lens.",42,,
520,0.97,5123.685,5157.385,"A lot of times these mandates open up the opportunity for local jurisdictions to engage in enforcement, including civil penalties, which will only create legal, financial obligations and exacerbate inequities throughout the communities, so I think, you know, it is really important for us to remember to wear our masks and it is also important for us to, in places where it is now mandated, to make sure that we are tracking any potential inequities to the broader community.",42,,
521,0.97,5157.385,5168.997,Appreciate Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Herbold bringing this issue up around enforcement and just the need to continue to wear our masks.,42,,
522,0.97,5168.997,5169.197,Okay.,42,,
523,0.97,5169.197,5190.919,"And Lastly, I'll just say that really quickly, want to make sure that folks saw the E-mail related to the Telework policy that I distributed last week.",42,,
524,0.97,5190.919,5232.56,"Want to acknowledge the direction to Telework through the ENOF the year made great needs around office resources, everything from office supplies to technology needs and let folks know here on the call, you colleagues, for your staff and for all of the legislative staff that we are working in the division directors and other folks throughout the city to take stock of what the resources might be as we look at Teleworking for the rest of the year and hope to be able to figure out how we can address some of those needs.",42,,
525,0.97,5232.56,5237.298,"Obviously when we're in our--when we're in city hall, we have resources available to us.",42,,
526,0.97,5237.298,5241.769,"We can work down our hall, go to the office supply room and get what we need.",42,,
527,0.97,5241.769,5243.938,"We have printers available, et cetera.",42,,
528,0.97,5243.938,5252.146,That office infrastructure obviously is not present for many of our workers employees that are working from home.,42,,
529,0.97,5252.146,5262.657,I acknowledge that that is a real need that is going to be addressed and so happy to continue to look into that issue.,42,,
530,0.97,5262.657,5295.857,"If there are any other issues that you all have been hearing from either your staff or other legislative staff, do not hesitate to bring that up to me or Cody writer in my office as we continue to address the realities of the need to continue to Telework, again, because we continue to exist in an environment where Covid-19 and its infectious nature is still very much a reality and present for all of us.",42,,
531,0.97,5295.857,5302.63,"So happy to take any questions or comments on my report, colleagues.",42,,
532,0.97,5302.63,5303.231,Councilmember Mosqueda?,43,,
533,0.97,5303.231,5304.065,"Thank you, Council President.",44,,
534,0.97,5304.065,5318.479,I want to say thank you for the last item on your report for the leadership that you have shown with closing our public facing side of the operations and through the end of the year.,44,,
535,0.97,5318.479,5335.53,"We have made, I think, tremendous leaps and bounds in making sure that the public can continue to engage via public comment and to make sure that people can continue to send us messages and E-Mails and I know that many of the Councilmembers are having office hours still.",44,,
536,0.97,5335.53,5343.738,"The public engagement portion continues, but the risk that people are taking has decreased because of the opportunities that you're allowing for people to stay home.",44,,
537,0.97,5343.738,5347.442,"I think that is so important for the health of the public, first.",44,,
538,0.97,5347.442,5354.048,"The health of our staff, and the health of each of our offices as well.",44,,
539,0.97,5354.048,5382.076,"I think it is similar to what we're hearing from other businesses who have made tough decisions to encourage or to require their employees to stay home, but I think it shows leadership for all of the businesses and other immunities who may be grappling with what to do given the number of individuals who are now contracting Covid and the likelihood it will become much, much worse in September, October, coupled with influenza.",44,,
540,0.97,5382.076,5398.993,I think you're making the right choice and that shows leadership that I hope continues to see Replicated amongst other businesses and municipalities throughout the region.,44,,
541,0.97,5398.993,5403.998,Thank you for putting that in place so our public can continue to engage in the process.,44,,
542,0.97,5403.998,5408.136,It makes so our process is running smoothly and we're protecting people from getting sick and dying.,44,,
543,0.97,5408.436,5438.866,"I will say that we extended our meetings, which is right in line with what we said last week through July 1. we do not know how much longer that proclamation will be extended.",45,,
544,0.97,5438.866,5477.505,"But, I do want to make really clear that it is my exultation that regardless of our need to comply with the open public needs Act and what that might look like, at the expiration of the proclamation 2028, I do think it is important for us to continue to meet remotely, and to continue to work with FAS in and around making our environment safe in the event that there needs to be options for individuals to occasionally pop in to the office.",45,,
