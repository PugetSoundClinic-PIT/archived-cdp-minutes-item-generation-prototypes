260,0.97,2246.077,2250.281,"Issue identification forms are what we call form a's for the general public, and this year we have 158 form a's.",30,,

268,0.97,2301.799,2315.68,"Additionally many of the forms do you have a large dollar amount, we are going to need to continue to remind folks that in the next Iteration each of these items need to be Self- balancing.",30,,
269,0.97,2315.746,2320.351,As we do not have enough revenue for existing programs.,30,,
270,0.97,2320.418,2324.689,One of the challenges that we are going to have in front of us is to continue to identify revenue streams.,30,,

272,0.97,2327.725,2335.199,This means we are $214 million less than the whole family would have been.,30,,
273,0.97,2335.266,2339.503,But we also know there is more we need in our community given the crisis that Covid has presented or exacerbated.,30,,
274,0.97,2339.57,2351.649,So we will encourage you to continue to think through the revenue streams identified with the issue identification forms so the next Iteration we will be able to have a Self- balancing conversation when it comes to more needs.,30,,
275,0.97,2351.716,2364.862,"As a reminder though for the public these show of identifications are really more of a narrative explanation of what you're interested in looking at, and do not have to have a self Alanson dollar amount associated with them.",30,,
276,0.97,2364.929,2366.53,But that will be coming up very shortly.,30,,
277,0.97,2366.597,2380.544,"Just a quick preview of what to expect during issue identification, for central staff will present the issues on the options they have identified to their independent analysis.",30,,

279,0.97,2393.557,2413.31,"With over 150 proposals though, these summaries will need to be very brief, and then I ask folks to keep to a very short Timeline on those and I will follow-up with you on that same.",30,,
280,0.97,2413.377,2416.58,"Third, the proposal submitted via the form will be grouped together by Department or issue area.",30,,
281,0.97,2416.647,2421.919,"If the proposal you submitted this for a department which central staff did not prepare a Standalone summary paper, then it will be presented at the end.",30,,
282,0.97,2421.986,2435.332,This year I will not be asking for folks to provide a show of hands for support for form a's.,30,,
283,0.97,2435.399,2438.602,We are limiting the conversations to discussions only is information on which to base form P's.,30,,

289,0.97,2477.041,2484.515,"This is a really important conversation that we are having, it is not just a historical perspective on the ways in which Redlining and racist comments and Exclusionary zoning and land policies have led to segregation.",30,,
290,0.97,2484.582,2501.632,"But it is a relevant conversation for today's analysis of how we need to change zoning and building practices so that we can create a more inclusive, affordable and sustainable city.",30,,
291,0.97,2502.099,2517.181,"I had the opportunity to be part of a panel this evening, a really incredible privilege to be on a panel with Councilmember Claudia Balducci from King County and Colleen echo hawk, to Seattle Club, and this panel will follow in our presentation from Richard Rothstein.",30,,
292,0.97,2517.248,2518.249,The presentation starts at 7:30 P.M.,30,,
293,0.97,2518.315,2534.465,"Tonight and you can still get tickets at Www.Townhallseattl E.Org, click in the middle there is an icon that Litchi to the history of housing segregation today.",30,,
294,0.97,2534.531,2546.577,"And Madam President just very briefly on the summaries for folks who have not had the chance to hear about this book or hear about Rothstein before, the summary or preview of the discussion this afternoon.",30,,
295,0.97,2546.644,2559.59,"Rothstein writes ""today's residential segregation in the North, South, Midwest and West is not the unintended Onsequences of individual choices, and otherwise Well- meaning log regulation.",30,,
296,0.97,2559.657,2581.378,"But upon hidden public policy that explicitly segregated every metropolitan area in the United States ."" he goes on to write ""by failing to recognize that we now live with a severe and enduring effects of segregation by law public policy we avoid confronting our constitutional obligation to reverse it.",30,,
297,0.97,2581.445,2592.156,"We have an obligation to address this as a constitutional issue, not just a moral obligation.",30,,
298,0.97,2592.222,2610.474,"This is a moral obligation as well as a constitutional obligation that we are required to fill ."" in summary he says, ""We have created a caste system in this country by way of the segregation policies as it relates to housing, by racially exclusive government policies.",30,,
299,0.97,2610.541,2629.526,"And although many cases where these policies are no longer on the books, they have never been redeemed, and their effects indoor ."" so this is a discussion about the ways in which the legacy of explicit racial covenants in our zoning and housing policies continue today.",30,,
300,0.97,2629.593,2655.519,"He talks about Seattle in this book, and this is as recent as 2007 Supreme Court ruling that relayed back to Seattle's racist Covenant policies, and how we as public policymakers have the opportunity and obligation to amend and change these policies.",30,,
301,0.97,2655.586,2659.189,If you have not read it he will do a better job than I did in summarizing it.,30,,
302,0.97,2659.256,2659.59,Come tonight.,30,,
303,0.97,2659.656,2660.391,Thank you Madam President.,30,,
304,0.97,2660.457,2663.227,Thank you so much Councilmember Mosqueda.,31,,
305,0.97,2663.293,2666.697,Any questions or comments on that report?,31,,
306,0.97,2666.764,2687.818,"Okay hearing none, thank you so much Councilmember Morales--Mosqueda walking us through what to expect the rest of the week . I had a couple of questions for you and maybe Allie, who I see is on the line with us this morning.",31,,
307,0.97,2687.885,2695.759,"So first in terms of the health one, why am I forgetting what it is called?",31,,
308,0.97,2695.826,2706.403,"The health one right along, can you talk a little bit more about Covid safety precautions that are taken during that ride along?",31,,
309,0.97,2706.47,2720.317,"Especially since presumably it is done within a contained, enclosed space for a prolonged period of time?",31,,
310,0.97,2720.384,2720.951,"Yes, absolutely.",32,,
311,0.97,2721.018,2722.186,"So first, everybody bring your mask.",32,,
312,0.97,2722.252,2728.792,"I showed up with my mask with double filters and, they also have N95 masks for you upon arrival.",32,,
313,0.97,2728.859,2746.743,"There was a small discussion with the Roundtable of firefighters, case managers from Hst, and I was also joined, I really appreciate the folks from Iaf f 27, Leah joined me from the general firefighters perspective.",32,,
314,0.97,2746.81,2755.119,"We sat socially distanced, but it was inside and we did all have masks on with appropriate ventilation within the room as well.",32,,
315,0.97,2755.185,2770.968,"So if folks would like to do the right along and you prefer to have a Roundtable discussion outdoors or perhaps in the garage they have which is much bigger, I know that is an option as well.",32,,
316,0.97,2771.034,2796.393,"In terms of the ride along we had gloves and the N95 masks as well and because of the need to ensure there is trust built with the firefighters and case managers as they go out with the health one team, we did not go directly to talk to the individuals they were serving we basically observed and respected the distance from afar.",32,,
317,0.97,2796.46,2800.797,See you're not interacting with individuals in the community.,32,,
318,0.97,2800.864,2804.101,But more observing how the team interacts.,32,,
319,0.97,2804.168,2815.078,"Even from a distance I could see that the individuals they were assisting, they were concerned about injuries on his feet.",32,,
320,0.97,2815.145,2824.321,Once they got him socks and pants and got him clothed.,32,,
321,0.97,2824.388,2831.828,"His demeanor changed and you could see the experience even from afar and how that relationship really is important, and you can do that while socially distancing.",32,,
322,0.97,2831.895,2838.202,"So, I felt very safe and I know if other Councilmembers would like to go they are very accommodating to make sure you feel safe in that regard as well.",32,,
323,0.97,2838.268,2841.171,Thank you for that.,33,,
324,0.97,2841.238,2850.714,And I appreciate the offer to want to do the ride along and sort of the challenge for lack of a better term.,33,,
325,0.97,2850.781,2866.63,"I do want to acknowledge that every single Councilmember comes to this pandemic with their own personal lived experiences, and Pre-Existing conditions, and et cetera et cetera related to potential exposure.",33,,
326,0.97,2866.697,2882.813,So I want to make sure that the firefighters who don't hear from certain Councilmembers understand that may be the motivation for not hearing from certain Councilmembers as opposed to a lack of interest or excitement about the health one program.,33,,
327,0.97,2877.808,2884.348,Which I have been very supportive of from the get go.,33,,
328,0.97,2884.414,2904.801,"But I just want to acknowledge that, not everyone may be able to participate in a ride along because of issues related to potential exposure to Covid-19.",33,,
329,0.97,2905.702,2908.872,"Even under maximum safety precautions, so I just wanted to put that out there really quickly.",33,,
330,0.97,2908.939,2936.033,"And then second, in terms of the budget, Allie I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about--just thread the needle a little bit for us on the form'--form a's . I think some folks may be a little Shellshocked by the number of form a's submitted them what the significance is and what the impact is on the budget.",33,,
331,0.97,2936.099,2944.975,I think it is important for us to have an opportunity to explain to the viewing public that just because you submit a form a does not mean it becomes part of the budget.,33,,
332,0.97,2945.042,2956.353,"And I think that a lot of times, particularly members and various student numbers in our media began to crunch the numbers on the total tally of the form a's and run with that.",33,,
333,0.97,2956.42,2985.182,"And the Council intends to make some sort of ads of full-time millions of dollars into the budget, and I just think it is really important to provide clarity around what the precise goal is of the form a's so that there isn't miscellaneous information floating around about the Council's intent as it relates to the form a's process.",33,,
334,0.97,2985.248,3000.23,"Thank you, I think Council's budget process is sort of a narrowing of ideas as we move through the process.",34,,
335,0.97,3000.297,3005.635,"So the proposal submitted through form a are at the beginning stages, expressing Councilmembers interests in pursuing opportunities to make changes to the Mayor's proposed budget.",34,,
336,0.97,3005.702,3020.817,"So these are high level proposals that reflect a range of ideas in terms of restoring projects that are cut in the proposed budget, increasing funding for certain services, expressing where Councilmember priorities are.",34,,
337,0.97,3020.884,3043.94,In the next phase and as we move forward it starts to get narrower as we look at what resources are available and how priorities line with the Mayor's proposed budget and the Council.,34,,
338,0.97,3044.007,3049.179,"In many cases all of this is important work and expressed priorities, however there are many things in the proposed budget that are also Councilmember priorities.",34,,
339,0.97,3049.246,3050.313,There will be hard choices ahead.,34,,
340,0.97,3050.38,3052.883,These form a's are just indicating interest in modifying the Mayor's proposed budget.,34,,
341,0.97,3052.949,3066.43,"We are not necessarily so dialed in that we know the exact dollar amount to fulfill the Councilmembers authorities, or is it necessarily saying that it is a higher priority than the other items that are in sort of the base budget and that Sor of thing.",34,,
342,0.97,3066.496,3074.471,"And we will refine the proposals as we move forward, but this is an opportunity for Councilmembers to put a large number of ideas out there for discussion.",34,,
343,0.97,3074.538,3083.113,And it doesn't necessarily indicate that there is a proposal that will move forward.,34,,
344,0.97,3083.18,3088.151,And also if something is not included in these proposals it can still be brought up in other rounds and other discussions.,34,,
345,0.97,3088.218,3101.765,"Great, thank you and thank you for allowing me the opportunity to pivot over to Allie and provide a little bit more context and texture to that form a process in terms of the global work that we will be undergoing over the next couple of months.",35,,
346,0.97,3101.832,3110.74,Thank you thank you Council President.,36,,
347,0.97,3110.807,3114.778,"I think that is a really important reminder for the public, and also for folks who are covering this issue.",36,,
348,0.97,3114.845,3127.023,"And as a reminder that we restarted in our discussion about the proposed 2021 budget is that we, as a legislative branch, have to do these conversations in public.",36,,
349,0.97,3127.09,3135.131,We are the only branch that touches the budget that actually does these deliberations in public.,36,,
350,0.97,3135.198,3144.04,"So what you see is sort of the Behind-The-Scenes sausage making that may have been done by lawyers offices, they were contemplating budget items.",36,,
351,0.97,3144.107,3146.309,This is our chance as the legislative branch to contemplate items.,36,,
352,0.97,3146.376,3149.946,And some of these items to have large ticket values to them.,36,,
353,0.97,3150.013,3158.688,"We will need to have a discussion as we do in public about where our values and priorities lie, and I know we want to do much, much more if we had more resources.",36,,
354,0.97,3158.755,3173.503,"But we will be engaged in those conversations on how to narrow down, as Allie said the priorities.",36,,
355,0.97,3173.57,3178.375,It is a very good reminder Council president and a reminder for the public as well that this is exactly what we should be doing.,36,,
356,0.97,3178.441,3180.911,Thinking through all various options and having those discussions delivered in public.,36,,
357,0.97,3180.977,3189.319,"And Lastly I would just say a note from the health one team, it was a challenge and a good gesture because they were also very appreciative, I want to pass on their notes of appreciation for past investments as well.",36,,
358,0.97,3189.386,3202.332,"You all, I think, have a tremendous amount of respect from the fact that we all have been trying to invest in this project for many, many years.",36,,
359,0.97,3202.399,3211.508,And the health one team is up and running in just a half a year under their belt to really show incredible progress already.,36,,
360,0.97,3211.575,3233.196,"Serving over 400 people, we have such an incredible team, and they have also expressed appreciation for the support they received so if you cannot make it in person I really understand and thank you Council president for reminding us all.",36,,
361,0.97,3233.263,3236.566,We all come to the Covid situation from very different places and I completely understand that.,36,,
362,0.97,3236.633,3242.772,"So thank you so much to the folks who provided the tour and for those who are able to go, for sharing what you can with the rest of your colleagues.",36,,
363,0.97,3242.839,3243.34,Thank you.,36,,
364,0.97,3243.406,3247.01,Thank you Mosqueda for that and for the notes from the team over at health one.,37,,
365,0.97,3247.077,3256.553,We always feel that and make an investment in creative models that we are prepared to respond to Acuity needs out on the streets was a wise investment.,37,,
366,0.97,3256.62,3264.294,"And I think that that is being proven very well by this team, so I really do appreciate it.",37,,
367,0.97,3264.361,3276.573,We will continue to look forward to more of their creative innovative and compassionate work out in the field.,37,,
368,0.97,3276.64,3283.546,Okay folks if there are no other questions or comments on the report from Councilmember Ãšmosqueda.,37,,
369,0.97,3283.613,3286.016,"We will move down the line, next up is Councilmember Morales, good morning.",37,,
370,0.97,3286.082,3288.051,Good morning.,38,,

376,0.97,3334.23,3346.342,"I want to acknowledge indigenous people stay, and thank those who advocated for this resolution in 2014, including the affiliated tribes of Northwest Indians, the Seattle human rights Commission, and others.",38,,

380,0.97,3372.302,3372.769,Congratulations to them.,38,,
381,0.97,3372.836,3385.181,Last week I had a meeting with the central Puget sound economic development board of which I am a member through the Ksr sea.,38,,
382,0.97,3385.248,3402.165,"I heard from the Washington State Department of Commerce and others about the need to focus on workforce development in the area through just our skills training for displaced workers, for younger workers, as we move into what we hope will be a regional economic recovery.",38,,
383,0.97,3402.232,3406.669,We also did learn about the latest round of cares funding for small businesses.,38,,

394,0.97,3490.854,3496.659,So that we can allow folks to stay and still engage with services in the area rather than completely being removed from the area.,38,,
395,0.97,3496.726,3521.484,"Last week we convened a meeting between folks in the Cid as well as with reach, lead, CRS and other providers where neighbors learned about implementation of the just cares program to help folks like those living in the I-5 encampment to find supportive shelter at hotels.",38,,

398,0.97,3543.64,3554.05,"Those who are living outside, those who are in vehicles or tents, tiny home or other shelter, we really have tried to make sure that we are connecting them to services as well as helping folks in different parts of the District understand what resources and service providers are already doing.",38,,
399,0.97,3554.117,3577.707,"So that they are clearer about the fact that with the resources we have, with the resources that we have already committed to increasing access to services, we are hoping to really be able to move people into more stable situations.",38,,
400,0.97,3577.774,3579.976,My office is working hard at One-On-One engagement with constituents.,38,,

406,0.97,3614.911,3616.379,And I think that is a great question.,38,,
407,0.97,3616.446,3618.748,I don't think as a body we have really had that conversation.,38,,
408,0.97,3618.815,3628.624,So I just want to share with folks the principles that our office will be using as we move through this process.,38,,

413,0.97,3655.785,3688.351,"We want to make sure we are investing in and providing better services for our homeless members and that we are really looking at how we plan for the seventh generation . and by that we mean making sure that our air quality, water quality, access to the infrastructure for better health especially for black and Brown neighborhoods are a part of the conversation and decision-making as we move forward.",38,,
