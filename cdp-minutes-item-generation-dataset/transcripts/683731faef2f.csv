26,0.97,346.079,351.517,I'm going to take a moment--I appreciate the invitation and offered to join this morning.,6,,
27,0.97,351.517,359.292,"I am Onora lien, executive director of the Northwest Healthcare response network.",6,,
28,0.97,359.292,361.728,I will share my slides and confirm that you are able to,6,,
29,0.97,361.728,363.496,Yes.,7,,
30,0.97,363.496,375.108,"Again, I appreciate the opportunity to be with you and let me see if I can make it work on my end.",8,,
31,0.97,375.108,383.049,So I know we--I appreciate the update in terms of when we need to wrap up our remarks.,8,,
32,0.97,383.049,395.027,I want to give some background on who we are.,8,,
33,0.97,395.027,412.078,When we think about planning it is important to think about what we are doing at a regional level and in collaboration with the States.,8,,
34,0.97,412.078,429.595,"We were here about some of the perspective from Uw medicine, but I also asked Dr. Timothy Dellit to join us because of the partnership that we have with Uw medicine to develop regional capabilities which will speak about later in the presentation.",8,,
35,0.97,429.595,441.507,We will share thoughts and considerations we should keep in mind going forward from where we are today to continue to anticipate future potential peaks or other things.,8,,
36,0.97,441.507,469.702,"From a Healthcare delivery perspective and a preparedness surge perspective, it is important that we keep in mind that Healthcare organizations are independent and on a Day-To- day basis they compete and there really is a centralized entity that brings all those independent partners together to collaborate and coordinate on different aspects of Healthcare related disaster preparedness and response.",8,,
37,0.97,469.702,483.749,Pandemics can overwhelm the individual efforts and individual providers and counties and regions and these are very significant efforts requiring an all hands on deck approach.,8,,
38,0.97,483.749,507.573,It is always important to keep in mind that a successful response requires the collaboration on the public health side and vital efforts that they undertake to prevent the spread of disease and respond in those ways . and the efforts of clinical Healthcare partners who are supporting the response to treatment of the disease.,8,,
39,0.97,507.573,534.166,"My organization, as you heard earlier, sits at the intersection as a nonprofit coalition that has been a place for number of years to support the collaboration between individual Healthcare organizations got to bring a framework for Coronation at the local levels, certainly across King County, but more broadly we serve and coordinated across Western Washington.",8,,
40,0.97,534.166,536.402,We are one of three Healthcare coalitions in the state.,8,,
41,0.97,536.402,547.313,There is a similar coalition based out of Spokane that coordinates across Eastern Washington and a collaborative effort in the Vancouver area.,8,,
42,0.97,547.313,563.996,"We work in collaboration with one another and support the coordination with Healthcare organizations, public health partners, and many others so we have a coordinated approach to Healthcare aspects of disaster preparedness day today.",8,,
43,0.97,563.996,572.338,Certainly engagement around Covid-19 and aspects of the response activities.,8,,
44,0.97,572.338,583.749,Were we intersect and what issues we focus on sometimes varies depending on this Norio and the issues that are in front of us.,8,,
45,0.97,583.749,598.864,We are but one of many systems and partners working together to respond to some of the aspects of disaster response.,8,,
46,0.97,598.864,619.485,"Leadership, the governor's office appointed the director of the Covid-19 health system response management and she is working in collaboration with many partners at the state and local level.",8,,
47,0.97,619.485,650.316,"And as we move forward strong coordination engagement with the State Department of health and Washington State Hospital Association and many other medical associations, Healthcare coalitions like myself, individual organizations and providers, local public health and emergency management, all having a stake in different aspects of coordination and support for how the delivery system response in a disaster.",8,,
48,0.97,650.316,669.435,"As Covid-19 has evolved and is the framework within the state continues to evolve, the governor and the State Department of health set forward an Overarching framework that has guided some of the state and local efforts around this.",8,,
49,0.97,669.435,671.303,I am Prioritizing a couple areas.,8,,
50,0.97,671.303,678.344,"When we think about surge planning, there are a couple of key elements to that.",8,,
51,0.97,678.344,685.951,"One, that you have the space, and that you have the staff and also that you have the supplies.",8,,
52,0.97,685.951,690.156,So we think this is in three components.,8,,
53,0.97,690.156,694.026,"Space, staff, and supplies.",8,,
54,0.97,694.026,712.578,"As we think about the scale of what this response needs to include, there has been a wide variety of efforts to think about how do we ensure that Healthcare facilities or the community have enough places to care for patients and that we look at building strategies to create surge for staff and we have enough supplies.",8,,
55,0.97,712.578,723.689,"Within this structure different entities, such as the State Department of health have taken leadership in some of these areas.",8,,
56,0.97,723.689,738.904,"So as we look at things like alternate care field hospital sites, the state has taken leadership in some of those planning areas and Partnering with locals were needed.",8,,
57,0.97,738.904,747.48,From a staffing perspective there is work that individual organizations do to look at how they can increase staff and support the staff that is available to them.,8,,
58,0.97,747.48,761.427,The state has also taken on additional leadership at looking at ways that we can bring in medical workers and volunteers into the state and is taking the lead on coordinating how those resources would be mobilized and were they would be applied were necessary.,8,,
59,0.97,761.427,777.51,And from a supply perspective we look at what individual health systems can do and look at resource requesting processes through local communities up to the state when resources are scarce and need to be requested.,8,,
60,0.97,777.51,786.152,And they've also taken on leadership around identifying additional supplies that could be brought in such as requesting additional Ventilators.,8,,
61,0.97,786.152,796.562,"The coordination in terms of how we can coordinate with Healthcare organizations is a local, regional, state effort.",8,,
62,0.97,796.562,807.339,And the coalitions have focused some of our specific efforts to target this bigger state strategy in a couple of key areas.,8,,
63,0.97,807.339,837.203,One is how do we ensure cross the Healthcare system and across our partners that we have good Situational awareness about what the resource needs are within the Healthcare system and as a coalition we have mechanisms for supporting mutual aid and resource sharing across Healthcare organizations.,8,,
64,0.97,837.203,856.822,"And then third, how do we think about coordination strategies for making sure we are fully utilizing every available bed, both at an institutional level but then outside institutions how we coordinate across hospitals and regions to make sure that if there is a surge of patients that we are utilizing every bed that is available.",8,,
65,0.97,856.822,887.553,Within the state and working in collaboration with state partners we wanted to make sure that there was good guidance being provided to Healthcare partners in terms of strategies and to be thinking about the support surge and continuity of patient care and at the state level making sure that we address the regulatory policies and Healthcare able to maximize the surge capacity.,8,,
66,0.97,887.553,899.031,So we've been supporting Healthcare organizations in convening and coordinating with those partners locally but it is part of a bigger state effort.,8,,
67,0.97,899.031,908.941,So a lot of elements are being touched and tackled by a wide variety of Stakeholders.,8,,
68,0.97,908.941,939.004,"We are focused on a couple of key areas providing Situational awareness about hospital capacity and helping to develop systems that we are collecting good data, convening clinical leaders and advisory committees and subject matter experts to inform and make sure we have good clinical guidance for Healthcare tools to support organizations in implementing their medical surge strategies.",8,,
69,0.97,939.004,946.312,We also identify gaps and coordinate together on different solutions.,8,,
70,0.97,946.312,971.904,"And then one particular initiative I will speak to today, and as I said regarding coordination of how we can work across hospitals to make sure we maximize our bed availability and having good coordinated strategies is we will speak about the regional Covid coordination center.",8,,
71,0.97,971.904,974.64,That is a strategy to support that critical element of surge.,8,,
72,0.97,974.64,992.424,"Regarding Situational awareness, one of the core areas we have focused on is our aim as a coalition is to provide Situational awareness about hospital capacity and where there might be resource needs and what the resource needs are.",8,,
73,0.97,992.424,1018.384,"And as we move forward in the response we have been working hard to develop additional capabilities to look at what kind of data collection would be needed, both are Healthcare partners need and other Stakeholders are looking for to characterize with the impact to Healthcare is and what the needs of been.",8,,
74,0.97,1018.384,1045.811,"Over the last number of weeks we have been Scaling up data collection efforts and trying to develop a more comprehensive approach to how we get information that helps us characterize effectively what the hospital capacity is, including what kind of Icu and other bed ability there is an ventilator availability and what kind of Ppe is available within the system.",8,,
75,0.97,1045.811,1062.494,We have worked very closely to develop a cohesive statewide approach to how we collect information and make sure we have consistent information and we are able to sure that back with hospitals and Healthcare and also with public health officials.,8,,
76,0.97,1062.494,1077.91,The systems we have been developing were partnership with the Washington State Hospital Association and so it has taken us a few weeks to wrap up a consistent data reporting from hospitals.,8,,
77,0.97,1077.91,1090.522,But we have daily reporting coming in from hospitals we're doing that in partnership with the state hospital Association.,8,,
78,0.97,1090.522,1098.697,But as we get regular data we have different rays of sharing the data with the Healthcare system and public health partners.,8,,
79,0.97,1098.697,1111.844,I will highlight some of the data that is being collected includes total number of hospitalized patients with Covid-19.,8,,
80,0.97,1111.844,1124.656,"The State Department of health is posting this information on the Website and we are continuing to look at different ways to provide Dashboards and tools to share additional information about those Metrics like bed availability and ventilator availability, etc.",8,,
81,0.97,1124.656,1130.963,So additional reports will come out from these so we can ensure that information more broadly.,8,,
82,0.97,1130.963,1150.015,"Some of you, I think, I have heard about efforts that we started a few weeks ago . My team has been Partnering with Microsoft to develop some additional capabilities and more efficient Dashboards to share this information.",8,,
83,0.97,1150.015,1156.288,The work we have been doing with the state hospital Association has gotten us to one level of more consistent data collection.,8,,
84,0.97,1156.288,1173.805,I believe on April 2ND there was a requirement of hospitals to report information and that information is being collected through the tools and surveys we are doing in partnership with the state hospital Association.,8,,
85,0.97,1173.805,1201.833,"That is what I would say is phase 1 of data collection efforts and strategies to share this information and through partnership with Microsoft we are building additional Portals to help ease some of the reporting burden but make sure we have all that key information available . The State Department of health is taking on the initiative and will be working with us, the other coalitions and hospital partners, to launch a more robust effort statewide.",8,,
86,0.97,1201.833,1218.083,So more information in a week or two ahead about how that system will evolve statewide in terms of collecting information and more Dashboards and tools to support statewide information sharing.,8,,
87,0.97,1218.083,1234.6,"Another area we have been focused on, one of our organizations roles is we convene teams of clinical experts to advise state and local and public health and Healthcare readiness and medical surge planning.",8,,
88,0.97,1234.6,1272.804,We have been convening the disaster medical advisory committee to review different clinical tools or clinically focused tools and documenting different strategies that Healthcare organizations and providers can use to make sure we are maximizing all of the care and ways in which we can optimize care for patients during these kind of responses and making sure that we have different tools and resources and thinking about conservation strategies.,8,,
89,0.97,1272.804,1279.978,"The goal is to make sure we can maximize and provide safe and effective care, in particular when there are times of resource scarcity.",8,,
90,0.97,1279.978,1302.968,So we want to make sure we put resources in place that can guide Healthcare organizations and providers in providing the most optimal care and thinking through situations where there may be resource scarcity and also help Healthcare organizations think about how they can do that.,8,,
91,0.97,1302.968,1308.273,Would have consistent standardize recommendations that are informed by the best clinical thinking.,8,,
92,0.97,1308.273,1322.888,"So our job has been to convene a bring together clinical leaders to help review, develop, and provide tools and guidelines that can be used statewide to support Healthcare providers in delivering care in times of surge.",8,,
93,0.97,1322.888,1344.609,"And then a bigger area of emphasis for us has been to focus on if we think about a Communitywide surge event and hive volumes of patients, we want to make sure there's a good coordinated approach so that we are able to leverage every available bed in the community.",8,,
94,0.97,1344.609,1356.021,So we have identified as this was escalating that there was a need for us to enhance systems that we already had in place.,8,,
95,0.97,1356.021,1379.711,"For many years, for example, in King County, Harborview medical center has played a role in disaster medical coordination were during a mass casualty incident has an important part in coordinating with other hospitals in terms of identifying where there are available beds and helping to direct EMS to where they can take patients to get appropriate levels of care.",8,,
96,0.97,1379.711,1414.079,We recognized there were additional Scaling up of that capability and think regionally and not just within King County but to think as a region and think across Western Washington how we can coordinate across individual hospitals and systems and organizations to make sure there is good coordinating structure to identify and maximize every available bed in the region and to think about how we can have a coordinated effort to distribute patients when necessary so we don't overburden any single hospital at one time.,8,,
97,0.97,1414.079,1461.86,"We built upon the disaster medical ordination model and added additional capabilities through harbor view and Uw medicine to build a more robust and enhanced model that allows us that--for example, those that may need to be transferred from a long-term care facility or if we were in a more significant surge, if hospitals needed to transfer if there were not enough beds within their own organizations and we needed to Decompress or identify additional beds, we have created with Harborview and Uw medicine this regional model that will do a couple of things.",8,,
98,0.97,1461.86,1486.218,"One, through the data we are collecting around bed availability, have good visibility and provide a coordinating system to work with facilities to identify a bed or transfer a patient into a hospital and can provide that coordinating function to match the patient to where the bed is available.",8,,
99,0.97,1486.218,1526.191,The goal in doing this is to make sure that we have strong search capacity and that we have mechanisms to coordinate when there are many patients that need to be placed in a hospital bed and that we do so in a way that we minimize the overburden in a single facility and we maximize the coordination and ability to coordinate across hospitals and around the region to make sure we are utilizing every available bed.,8,,
100,0.97,1526.191,1583.515,"So great credit to the University of Washington system and we've appreciated the collaboration and coordination with them to build this capability and make a much more enhanced resource available to support this kind of community surge if we were in a surge event and as Rc3 remains active, I-Team will make sure that we are supporting that center through coordination of Situational awareness and working with hospitals and other partners to make sure that that information is known and that we are collecting the best information we can from Healthcare organizations to help make sure we have visibility on beds, available beds, and what resources hospital needs--what resources the hospitals need to provide care for them in the moment and we will support by convening Healthcare organizations, whether that is through conference calls or other needs that might be necessary.",8,,
101,0.97,1583.515,1601.166,"If there are resources that are needed to support Healthcare organizations in helping to support the Facilitation of mutual aid and resource sharing and if we have available beds but additional resources are needed, we can match and support that.",8,,
102,0.97,1601.166,1611.142,And then continuing coordination with local and state and public health and emergency management is part of the broader response efforts.,8,,
103,0.97,1611.142,1636.301,"As we go forward, the good news is is perhaps we have hit the peak or at least the first peak in Washington and I think the hospital systems have done a tremendous amount of work to create capacity.",8,,
104,0.97,1636.301,1648.113,"Canceling elective Surgeries and a number of efforts they've undertaken to make sure there's capacity in the system and those of been significant measures they put into place, but we do have a lot of capacity in the Healthcare system right now.",8,,
105,0.97,1648.113,1651.516,And I think we are in a fairly good position.,8,,
106,0.97,1651.516,1662.527,But we want to keep all of these efforts in mind going forward whether there are additional peaks coming for us in the future and I think Dr.,8,,
107,0.97,1662.527,1664.329,Timothy Dellit will share his thoughts on those.,8,,
108,0.97,1664.329,1700.465,"We want to continue to look at what the best practices are that have been put in place and how do we refine these plans and I think put additional focus on long-term care and how we can continue to support and coordinate with long-term organizations and work with the state with long-term care facilities, associations, and others to make sure there is strong support and good strategies for supporting long- term care and trying to address some of the concerns in those facilities.",8,,
109,0.97,1700.465,1726.691,We continue to refine and incorporate some of these best practices that we have identified and we continue to refine our plans and think about if there is a surge and what additional planning we need to do to support that and I would say from my standpoint do not stop now and look at strategies to work together to support surge down the road.,8,,
110,0.97,1726.691,1732.397,I will stop there and Dr.,8,,
111,0.97,1732.397,1733.998,Dellit will share his thoughts.,8,,
112,0.97,1733.998,1738.303,I don't know if there are questions you want to take now you want to hear from Dr.,8,,
113,0.97,1738.303,1739.504,Dellit and then take questions,8,,
114,0.97,1739.504,1747.612,Let's finish the presentation and then we can take questions.,9,,
115,0.97,1747.612,1754.385,"I only have one Council members so far who has indicated she has questions, but she is agreed to wait until the end of the presentation.",9,,
116,0.97,1754.385,1758.123,So let's go ahead and continue.,9,,
117,0.97,1758.123,1765.43,"We are slated to spend 14 more minutes, including questions and answers on the subject.",9,,
118,0.97,1765.43,1768.333,Thank you.,10,,
119,0.97,1768.333,1794.259,I'm the chief medical officer for Uw medicine with a focus on infection prevention and control and I will try to briefly just give an example of preparation within a hospital system around surge planning in additional to the regional planning.,10,,
120,0.97,1794.259,1832.697,"Some of our responses, it does start with partnerships and although this has been an incredibly challenging time for community it is really wonderful to see everyone coming together as well as the coordination with the Department of health, the Washington State Hospital Association . Within Uw medicine on February 29th we put in place our incident command structure as well as incident command structures within each of our hospitals in order to better coordinate and align all of our activities.",10,,
121,0.97,1832.697,1839.003,A primary focus has been the safety of our workforce.,10,,
122,0.97,1839.003,1865.096,"This includes not only ensuring that they have the appropriate Ppe to safely care for patients with Covid-19, but focusing on the support of the staff and Clinicians because this has been incredibly challenging, stressful, a lot of anxiety for Healthcare workers and try to create a supportive environment for them for their mental Well- being as well as the physical safety caring for these patients.",10,,
123,0.97,1865.096,1879.244,We've been very fortunate that the beginning of January are clinical Virology laboratory developed a test that we could implement on March 2ND with FDA approval.,10,,
124,0.97,1879.244,1895.059,"That has served our local community and region incredibly well because as people recall, there were challenges with the initial CDC test and getting that into state LABS and delays in turnaround.",10,,
125,0.97,1895.059,1927.992,"Right now our lab is performing over 60% of all the tests within our region with an eight hour turnaround period of time and we have capabilities of doing 5000 per day and are working to continue to scale that because as we go in to this recovery phase, one of the key elements will be the rapid expansion of testing to identify those individuals who may be infected and then working with contact tracing as we get further into the pandemic.",10,,
126,0.97,1927.992,1934.499,Will also try to offload our clinics and emergency departments by setting up Drive- thru Testingsites.,10,,
127,0.97,1934.499,1944.609,"We did this initially for Healthcare workers and employees, but also for patients.",10,,
128,0.97,1944.609,1957.622,It is a goal to be able to streamline that process to test people as appropriate and also avoid them having to come into the clinics or through the emergency departments to maintain that capability for other Non-Covert care is needed.,10,,
129,0.97,1957.622,1962.126,Like other Healthcare systems we have dramatically implemented our Telehealth capacity.,10,,
130,0.97,1962.126,1991.522,"We do over 1500 Telehealth visits a day . from a surge planning standpoint, on March 10th we started to partner with the Institute for health Metrics and evaluation which is based within Uw medicine and we did this because we needed to have an understanding of what are those potential patient volumes that we need to target as we did surge planning.",10,,
131,0.97,1991.522,2010.675,"So working in partnership with them has allowed us to identify how many Icu beds we would need and what is the staffing for physicians and nurses that would be required for that, as well as equipment like Ventilators or Ppe.",10,,
132,0.97,2010.675,2031.796,"Back on March 16th we canceled our elective and Nonemergency procedures to build internal capacity as well as to preserve Ppe for the care of Covid-19 patients and then the governor implemented his order on March 18th, which now extends through the 18th of May.",10,,
133,0.97,2031.796,2033.998,We also have developed triage sites.,10,,
134,0.97,2033.998,2043.374,So how can we best separate patients with respiratory systems or Covid-19 from those who may be coming into the emergency Department for other medical care.,10,,
135,0.97,2043.374,2050.281,And we have set up alternative triage sites to evaluate and test those patients.,10,,
136,0.97,2050.281,2067.331,"We look at the alternative sites of care, especially as surge continues and let say if we have reached a point, but we haven't, but let's say we reach a point where the hospital is full, what are the alternative sites that we would need.",10,,
137,0.97,2067.331,2076.908,We've done a lot of focus on vulnerable populations with Harborview as a safety net working with the communities.,10,,
138,0.97,2076.908,2087.852,At 1.75% of the patients at Harborview with Covid-19 had limiting [Indiscernible] proficiency.,10,,
139,0.97,2087.852,2098.83,So how do we engage those communities and care for them because that is what we are starting to see is this continues to evolve.,10,,
140,0.97,2098.83,2131.696,We have partnered with the care of patients in long-term care facilities so skilled nursing facilities we have teams that are gone and to assist with the assessment and evaluation and tested all the residence within facilities as well as the staff and worked with them on policies and procedures to keep their residents safe and allow them to not just get through the pandemic safely but avoid the need of coming into the hospital if we can safely manage them within the skilled nursing facilities.,10,,
141,0.97,2131.696,2157.722,We also mentioned we have focused on the potential transition from conventional care that we delivered today to moving into what might be a contingency stage where we have to start using space or equipment in ways that are not our daily practice but allow us to achieve the same standard of care.,10,,
142,0.97,2157.722,2160.791,And what we want to avoid is going into the crisis standards of care.,10,,
143,0.97,2160.791,2166.898,And at this stage I feel confident we will not go there during this current phase.,10,,
144,0.97,2166.898,2171.202,I want to show a little bit of how we have used the modeling and I will go through this quickly.,10,,
145,0.97,2171.202,2183.748,"When we first engaged, the initial models they showed for us was an anticipated increase number of patients, over 960 four system.",10,,
146,0.97,2183.748,2189.62,A week later the peak was at 700.,10,,
147,0.97,2189.62,2195.126,But that gave us a target to say how can we identify an additional 700 beds within our Healthcare system.,10,,
148,0.97,2195.126,2206.871,And so that initial information from the modeling was important in terms of developing those initial targets.,10,,
149,0.97,2206.871,2214.145,They have developed these Metrics for state as well as other countries.,10,,
150,0.97,2214.145,2226.991,And these models are helpful to get a general sense but they are in perfect and they rely on all those measures around social distancing that we have in place.,10,,
151,0.97,2226.991,2250.381,"This is where the model was on April 2ND with anticipated that we would hit that peak around April 11th and at that point we looked good in terms of our bed capacity and we were a little short on Icu beds, but through these continued measures that been in place within the community we saw that those numbers dramatically decreased.",10,,
152,0.97,2250.381,2254.619,This is prefaced on continuing those social distancing measures we have done.,10,,
153,0.97,2254.619,2264.996,"And what we have seen within the system is we think we could've reached that plateau, but we have not seen the declining cases.",10,,
154,0.97,2264.996,2273.104,Within our system since April 1ST through today we've been between 115 and 120 patients within the four hospitals.,10,,
155,0.97,2273.104,2306.837,"So we are not escalating, which is good, but we are not seeing a decline yet and that suggests we have to maintain the diligence within the community around physical distancing until we start to see these numbers come down because even though the models are reassuring and give us cautious optimism, we still see large volumes of patients in a volume that we can manage, but we still have a long way to go until we get down to previous levels.",10,,
156,0.97,2306.837,2310.675,This is just an example of how we do this internally.,10,,
157,0.97,2310.675,2317.448,We look at conventional contingency and crisis capacity.,10,,
158,0.97,2317.448,2330.094,And although this is small it highlights that we go through Úwith each of our facilities what are the staffing needs for all those different members of the team and what are the different types of Equipments that we need in those phases.,10,,
159,0.97,2330.094,2380.344,"An example of this is we just looked at from a bed capacity for our four hospitals, so Uw medical center Northwest, Harborview, and Valley medical center, looking at the starting counts and not including our mental health force, but the medical surge units, phase 1, that is standard care where we are today, but if we did move into the contingency or crisis, what is the anticipated additional beds we would need and what we could do was match that initial projection of needing 700 beds and we were able to identify those across the system of how we could scale to that level.",10,,
160,0.97,2380.344,2395.359,And this is what all the hospitals are doing to think about what is the target and how do they scale their in case we did see that surge that Fortunately we are not seeing at that earlier predicted level.,10,,
161,0.97,2395.359,2397.628,I think that is my last slide.,10,,
162,0.97,2397.628,2404.735,"I wanted to give you a brief overview of how we have done this internally, but I won't have time for some questions as",10,,
163,0.97,2404.735,2407.371,Thank you so much.,11,,
164,0.97,2407.371,2418.749,"We have a little bit of time to take some questions . again, where slated to go until 10:15.",11,,
165,0.97,2418.749,2431.028,But we do have a little bit of flexibility and I know that Councilmember Morales had questions so I will go ahead and handed over to her to ask questions.,11,,
166,0.97,2431.028,2437.434,"And if we can be aware of the time crunch, that would be great.",11,,
167,0.97,2437.434,2438.869,Thank you.,12,,
168,0.97,2438.869,2451.615,"I think what I will do is just put my questions out there and you can answer what you can and if we don't have time to answer them all, maybe we can be in touch about getting follow-up answers.",12,,
169,0.97,2451.615,2470.534,"My first question is we know that in late March Washington received 500,000 masks and we keep hearing reports about medical personnel who are having to Reuse them several times during a week, for example.",12,,
170,0.97,2470.534,2487.618,"So my first question is how are those 500 map 500,000 masks getting distributed and is there an estimate when they will be able to use--get better access to Ppe that they need.",12,,
171,0.97,2487.618,2507.872,"The second question is that we know that the test has a false negative rate of about 30%, that is my understanding anyway, and I want to hear about the strategy for screening and Retesting frontline Healthcare professionals but also others in the community.",12,,
172,0.97,2507.872,2559.323,"And then, we know that based on hospitalizations or those that we know have had Covid 19, their means there is 1% immunity in the community and what is the strategy for preparing for a possible next wave . and finally, can you tell us about any movement happening at the Federal level toward building that contact tracing infrastructure that we talked about . We know that will be an important piece of helping to start seeing a declining cases, but my understanding is we do not have the infrastructure to do that at the level that we need.",12,,
173,0.97,2559.323,2562.793,"And is there something that counsel can do to advocate for that, I would like to hear",12,,
174,0.97,2562.793,2565.329,Let me start with a couple quick once.,13,,
175,0.97,2565.329,2569.7,The testing . We do not believe that our test has a false negative of 30%.,13,,
176,0.97,2569.7,2574.138,That might be the commercial ones but hours is very sensitive.,13,,
177,0.97,2574.138,2580.044,It was more sensitive than the initial test within the Department of health LABS.,13,,
178,0.97,2580.044,2584.715,Hours is about 2% to 3%.,13,,
179,0.97,2584.715,2598.529,"In that situation it is a matter that you may get someone very early when they have such a small amount of virus that is not detectable, but a few days later it is a higher level where you get the detection.",13,,
180,0.97,2598.529,2603.834,So hours is quite good and so we are not having to do multiple tests of individuals.,13,,
181,0.97,2603.834,2616.18,"It is where you pick them up in the system and as you saw in the skilled nursing facilities, upwards of 50% of the individuals that we identified as positive did not have symptoms.",13,,
182,0.97,2616.18,2617.848,So our test is quite good there.,13,,
183,0.97,2617.848,2638.702,"In terms of the waves, I agree with you that given the relatively low level of infection within the community, estimates are around 3%, I anticipate we likely will see another wave in the fall, particularly with the increases in respiratory viruses.",13,,
184,0.97,2638.702,2641.772,"And until we have a vaccine in place, we are at risk for that.",13,,
185,0.97,2641.772,2655.386,So we are doing a lot of work with Ihme modeling what that will look like in the future and how do we do community surveillance to inform all those decisions.,13,,
186,0.97,2655.386,2662.593,I wanted to answer those and then I will let Onora lien answer the others.,13,,
187,0.97,2662.593,2686.95,I think we should anticipate a second wave and from a surge planning perfect perspective there are some tremendous plans and work with State and Federal partners.,14,,
188,0.97,2686.95,2696.427,We cannot stop the surge planning and we have to look at the models and continue to look at strategies for how we can make sure hospitals will be able to continue to surge as they have planned.,14,,
189,0.97,2696.427,2701.665,And based on what the models tell us what additional resources we might need.,14,,
190,0.97,2701.665,2713.677,For me it is continuing to refine and pursue and look at ways that we can dial in these plans because I think we should assume there could be a second wave.,14,,
191,0.97,2713.677,2734.064,"With regard to the Pp question earlier, I cannot speak for any individual facility is doing but in terms of the numbers of Ppe coming into the state and how it is being allocated or distributed, that is being led by the State Department of health and distribution is happening through local public health and emergency management partners.",14,,
192,0.97,2734.064,2744.174,"I'm not in the best position to speak on how those have been allocated or distributed, but those are partners to follow-up with.",14,,
193,0.97,2744.174,2767.731,"All Healthcare systems have implemented preservation and conservation of Ppe practices that do include extended use, for instance, being able to use a mask for a longer period of time, but we do that with a face shield that protects the mask from being splattered on so that you can use it with multiple patients.",15,,
194,0.97,2767.731,2785.549,"Early on we did not know when we get the next supplies and when we looked at that very large search number, we need to ensure that we could not just manage for the surge capacity but do so through the month of May.",15,,
195,0.97,2785.549,2798.762,"So when we see where we are at with this plateau and the supply lines become more consistent, as we go down the other side of that curve, we will back off on some of those conservation methods.",15,,
196,0.97,2798.762,2809.573,"But those were done because at an early stage of the pandemic we needed to ensure that we had Ppe so Healthcare workers could safely care for these patients throughout the duration of the pandemic, not just that immediate situation.",15,,
197,0.97,2809.573,2814.044,But it is a great point that you raise.,15,,
198,0.97,2814.044,2815.646,Thank you so much.,16,,
199,0.97,2815.646,2821.552,I think Council member Herbold has a question.,16,,
200,0.97,2821.552,2855.085,"When my office started inquiring about hospital planning and setting up this briefing, it was focused on the modeling numbers that showed a great need and those numbers were moving us toward making decisions like inviting field hospitals . in the time we were organizing this, that changed.",17,,
201,0.97,2855.085,2875.138,"And I'm wondering from a planning perspective, we literally went from a period of nine days from starting to build a field hospital to deciding that we are going to stand back.",17,,
202,0.97,2875.138,2886.917,"From a planning perspective, are there lessons to be learned from that or is it just a matter of nothing more than working to make sure that the modeling is as precise as it can be in something like this",17,,
203,0.97,2886.917,2897.761,"Tim, we saying something?",18,,
204,0.97,2897.761,2905.435,It is a fair question and it is a little bit of the nature of how things have evolved.,18,,
205,0.97,2905.435,2931.662,"By the time the field hospital asset was requested by the state and deployed, the good news is we were not in a position where we were seeing a surge . and although we were not the Decision-Makers in terms of returning it, I think we can look nationally and see where there has been a great need in the governor's office and others have made that decision have moved forward.",18,,
206,0.97,2931.662,2946.877,I think the important thing for us to consider his modeling matters a lot and we have to have targets that we plan for in the community and I think as that continues to get refined it helps to identify targets.,18,,
207,0.97,2946.877,2951.682,It does take time to stand up these assets.,18,,
208,0.97,2951.682,2976.74,"One of the benefits is it came with personnel and that is one of the challenges of looking at field hospital planning or alternate care systems at the community level, planning is one thing to identify location and another thing to have all the personnel needed, and so it was a valuable asset and when I hope that if we needed could be made available again.",18,,
209,0.97,2976.74,2999.062,"But as we go forward, it is important to keep in mind that standing up these assets takes time and additional work will be needed to find where the personnel would be to support something like that if it was a Dod asset.",18,,
210,0.97,2999.062,3001.331,Thank you.,19,,
211,0.97,3001.331,3012.075,Any other questions from my colleagues?,20,,
212,0.97,3012.075,3015.946,I am not hearing any or receiving any requests for additional questions.,20,,
213,0.97,3015.946,3026.156,I want to think Council member Herbold for taking on the responsibility of organizing this presentation for us today and for the public.,20,,
214,0.97,3026.156,3027.891,It was important.,20,,
215,0.97,3027.891,3048.011,We hear a lot about the Uw model and it was interesting to hear about how you are utilizing this and appreciate the work that you're doing to make sure that the Healthcare system is ready for a surge.,20,,
216,0.97,3048.011,3065.896,So thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules during this busy time and to provide the public with more information.,20,,
217,0.97,3065.896,3071.401,Just my sincere thanks for joining us during this very busy time.,21,,
218,0.97,3071.401,3081.878,I appreciate your efforts.,21,,
219,0.97,3082.813,3094.157,You are welcome to leave the call if you wish and we will move through the rest of our agenda.,22,,
220,0.97,3094.157,3100.664,We are going to go ahead and move into a preview of today's city council actions and regional committee reports.,22,,
221,0.97,3100.664,3105.735,We will go ahead and go through that.,22,,
222,0.97,3105.735,3128.191,"I have received a request from a Councilmember that we do reports consistent with how we do the roll call but I failed to actually get the list of how we do roll call, so this week we will go in order of district number and next Monday we will take folks in the order that they are listed on the roll call.",22,,
223,0.97,3128.191,3135.999,"So if people want to mix it up a little bit for making it more of a dynamic meeting, I guess.",22,,
224,0.97,3135.999,3141.271,Let's go ahead and dig in to this part of our agenda.,22,,
225,0.97,3141.271,3146.576,Will start with Councilmember Herbold . the floor is yours.,22,,
226,0.97,3146.576,3151.014,Thank you.,23,,
227,0.97,3151.014,3158.588,At this afternoon's council meeting will we be discussing a bill that is cosponsored by Councilmember Morales.,23,,
228,0.97,3158.588,3189.619,"In the context of the moratorium for commercial tenant to operate small businesses and Nonprofits, the emergency order not only recommended an Eviction moratorium but it recommended that property owners be willing to enter into time payment plans with commercial tenants.",23,,
229,0.97,3189.619,3193.657,We know in some cases this is happening and in other cases it is not.,23,,
230,0.97,3193.657,3206.636,So small businesses cannot be evicted during nonpayment during the emergency but this is intended to establish a way for property owners to be paid in for small businesses to minimize rent debt.,23,,
231,0.97,3206.636,3215.145,The bill will also restrict increases in rents for small businesses during the public health emergency.,23,,
232,0.97,3215.145,3222.686,And payment plans will allow tenants to pay the rent over a longer period of time.,23,,
233,0.97,3222.686,3230.46,There's also an amendment we are bringing forward that will put some common sense limitations on the small businesses that are covered.,23,,
234,0.97,3230.46,3240.403,Businesses will need to have experienced an economic hardship and local outpost of large chains would not be eligible.,23,,
235,0.97,3240.403,3244.007,And that is necessary because of how we are defining small businesses.,23,,
236,0.97,3244.007,3273.069,We are defining small businesses as the number of employees in each location so that allows the potential of change and this would eliminate that possibility.,23,,
237,0.97,3273.069,3276.339,A few things I want to mention.,23,,
238,0.97,3276.339,3277.974,Thinks we have coming up this week.,23,,
239,0.97,3277.974,3320.15,Last week I asked the fire chief about the impact of the West Seattle bridge closure and we are expecting to get a response back from him sometime this week . He responded that they are currently conducting a comprehensive analysis of the impact of response time to closure of the bridge and that includes a review and how and when it opens for marine traffic as well as delays caused by rail traffic.,23,,
240,0.97,3320.15,3366.73,And where are expecting to get that analysis by April 17th . I want to also mention that myself and Councilmember Pedersen will be out visiting the West Seattle bridge tomorrow with the director to view the cracks in the bridge and also tomorrow afternoon I am hosting a conference call with district 1 service providers to hear from them about their efforts to serve members of the community as well as what we as a city can do to help enhance those efforts.,23,,
241,0.97,3366.73,3381.01,I have one amendment to the legislation regarding emergency Childcare but I will hope that until Councilmember Gonzalez has a report.,23,,
242,0.97,3381.01,3388.818,Any questions or comments on her report?,24,,
243,0.97,3388.818,3390.32,Okay.,24,,
244,0.97,3390.32,3398.428,"Seeing none, we will go ahead and go to District 2.",24,,
245,0.97,3398.428,3399.062,Good morning.,25,,
246,0.97,3399.062,3399.863,I will be brief.,25,,
247,0.97,3399.863,3416.312,There are no items on the calendar . We will be discussing the bill related to commercial rents restrictions . and I do want to thank Councilmember Herbold to cosponsor this with her.,25,,
248,0.97,3416.312,3428.892,This is an important issue for all of us as small businesses are suffering and we are trying to do what we can to protect our small business neighbors.,25,,
249,0.97,3428.892,3430.727,So I look forward to the conversation this afternoon.,25,,
250,0.97,3430.727,3433.296,That is all I have.,25,,
251,0.97,3433.296,3437.2,Any questions for Councilmember Morales?,26,,
252,0.97,3437.2,3444.107,Moving along to District 3.,26,,
253,0.97,3444.107,3445.375,"Good morning, everybody.",27,,
254,0.97,3445.375,3470.3,"There are no items on the city council agenda . the next regularly scheduled meeting would be Tuesday, April 28th at 2:00 PM, but we would be making sure that we look at the updated calendar and work with that.",27,,
255,0.97,3470.3,3478.041,And the Sustainability Committee is responsible for appointing eight people to the green new deal oversight board.,27,,
256,0.97,3478.041,3484.547,The terms beginning May and we would like to do appointments this month.,27,,
257,0.97,3484.547,3502.432,"If anyone was listening to this meeting would like to apply or Udo other community members would like to apply, where hosting a place on a Webpage and you can call myself or my staff members.",27,,

295,0.97,3799.662,3815.611,And these are basically what they call data snapshots and this is collected by parks that is not only the ambassadors with the other park employees that were out and they've collected data that is still being Fine-Tuned and we will have it soon to you . that is my understanding from the superintendent.,31,,
296,0.97,3815.611,3826.389,The main concern as we heard from the presentation from surge planning is there concerned about social distancing.,31,,
297,0.97,3826.389,3829.892,Is to avoid popular parks that are prone to overcrowding.,31,,
298,0.97,3829.892,3839.001,They're encouraging people to discover more of the 480 parks that we have in our system.,31,,
299,0.97,3839.001,3847.777,What they are doing now with parks is they are tracking use so they can make better decisions on which ones can stay open as the weather gets better.,31,,
300,0.97,3847.777,3860.523,So the social distancing observations will continue and they're putting the data together for us and we will get a more concise version of that soon.,31,,
301,0.97,3860.523,3883.246,"I was happy to hear from the earlier presentation that we thought we were going to hit the peak on April 11th and it was nice to see that we are not seeing a decline, but at least we are seeing that is not as horrific as what we thought we were going to see when they were making these models on April 2ND.",31,,
302,0.97,3883.246,3908.638,"I've been off and on the phone with the superintendent and we hope to put together and get a final version for all of you for the public that is listening and watching, the final plan of the data and how they measured each park and how they can start making some decisions based on data of what parks can remain open.",31,,

369,0.97,4642.17,4648.477,So we will go ahead and skip her report and go to my report.,38,,
370,0.97,4648.477,4654.516,I have two bills and today's full council agenda that are subject to a vote.,38,,
371,0.97,4654.516,4662.424,Both are technical changes and responsive to city operations related to the Covid-19 emergency response and crisis.,38,,
372,0.97,4662.424,4697.225,The first is 119770 and I'm suspending deadlines set in the municipal code for the duties of the Examiner and Supersede if you sections of the municipal code to account for the emergency ability to keep up with the volume of hearings in light of the governor's order to shelter in place.,38,,
373,0.97,4697.225,4730.492,"The second one is 119771, and this legislation will amend the family's education preschool and promise levy plan to include emergency Childcare services for frontline essential workers consistent with the Mayor's emergency order, which was issued on the 27th of March and to utilize dollars in order to pay for those services.",38,,
374,0.97,4730.492,4773.001,"I will have a lot more to say about this bill in detail this afternoon, but I want to make sure that people understand that it is a bill that is technical in nature because what we are doing is we're amending the implementation and evaluation plan to make it clear that these dollars are an allowed use from councils perspective and does subject the expenditures to oversight and accountability standards that are typically applied to these dollars in ordinary circumstances.",38,,
375,0.97,4773.001,4775.203,We will have more to say about this later.,38,,
376,0.97,4775.203,4803.632,"One last thing I will say about this bill is that we have an understanding that future expenditures for these types of early learning services, including the Seattle preschool promise--the Seattle preschool program will not be impacted.",38,,
377,0.97,4803.632,4818.28,So we believe that the level of service that we will be able to provide in our preschool programming and early learning programming moving forward beyond the emergency crisis will remain the same.,38,,
378,0.97,4818.28,4827.789,So we are using existing dollars that are not being used at all under current contracts because of school closures for these emergency services.,38,,
379,0.97,4827.789,4834.496,So it is effectively a cost neutral proposal.,38,,
380,0.97,4834.496,4848.91,"I want to make sure that that in terms of the impact for future Childcare services, we are not thinking there will be one.",38,,
381,0.97,4848.91,4867.829,I do understand that Councilmember Herbold has an amendment and I consider to be a friendly amendment and we had conversations with the executive about reporting requirements and making sure we understood how these dollars were being spent during the initial 30-day period and subsequent 30-day period.,38,,
382,0.97,4867.829,4878.206,So I appreciate Councilmember Herbold's attention to suggesting that we put them into the implementation and evaluation plan.,38,,

395,0.97,5013.074,5060.989,"It is also asking for increased to public health services including free testing treatments and prevention for Covid-19 and also requesting that emergency transit services, especially for the transit users and Lastly a request to protect vulnerable residents including immigrant and refugee populations by making sure that they are able to access qualified health plans for Covid-19 care and to create specific programs to access Healthcare.",39,,
396,0.97,5060.989,5078.306,I have agreed to request that Council members were interested in signing onto this letter do so at our 2:00 meeting.,39,,
397,0.97,5078.306,5083.344,So I think this has been Emailed out to your offices.,39,,
398,0.97,5083.344,5093.321,"So if you have any questions or additions, please get this to us for potential inclusion in the letter.",39,,
399,0.97,5093.321,5101.629,And I hope to get this across the finish line today.,39,,
