61,0.97,660.059,673.172,Colleagues we did hear this morning that we have an amendment coming to us on the referral calendar.,14,,
62,0.97,673.239,690.89,I move to amend the introduction and referral calendar by introducing 32021 entitled a resolution.,15,,
63,0.97,690.956,704.637,And stating the Council's support for full Decriminalization of these activities and by referring it to the city council.,15,,
64,0.97,704.703,705.071,Second.,16,,
65,0.97,705.137,715.748,It's been to amend the referral calendar . and referring it to the city council.,17,,
66,0.97,715.815,734.934,Council member Lewis I'm going to hand it over to you in order to address the amendments before we sent it to vote.,17,,
67,0.97,735.0,749.782,And I am not sure Wasintroduced on the calendar but here we are seeing there was a notice for introduction on Friday.,18,,
68,0.97,749.849,764.63,This resolution comes as a result of several months of process here at the city council.,18,,
69,0.97,764.697,769.435,In engaging with Decriminalize Seattle.,18,,
70,0.97,769.502,771.904,And the cultivation and use of these substances.,18,,
71,0.97,771.971,786.986,Council colleagues may recall that in June we signed a letter putting this matter on to the work program of the over dose invasion task force.,18,,
72,0.97,787.052,809.308,That task force came back in August with a recommendation for the Council to introduce policy into practice a De- emphasize on existing laws in the state of Washington and support for further Decriminalization of these laws.,18,,
73,0.97,809.375,828.928,This resolution is the first step as a Council coming out of that process following a symposium my office held a few weeks ago now to really Cue up this resolution.,18,,
74,0.97,828.994,859.325,This resolution is not by any means the end of a potential Council process but is the start by acknowledging an existing policy from the Seattle police Department released in the decision emphasizing that this is not a current law enforcement priority of the Seattle police Department in keeping the goals of Decriminalized nature and the goals of this Council . The resolution of course allows for the fact that those policy decisions to change in the past.,18,,
75,0.97,859.391,869.201,So commits the Council to continue to monitor this and look for ways to further solidify this policy.,18,,
76,0.97,869.268,878.911,Via through SPD policy or the potential of taking on some future Ordnance at this Council in some time to come.,18,,
77,0.97,878.978,890.489,"But for now this resolution also commits the city to keeping what we ultimately are going to need to really resolve this issue which is a full, full legislation from the state.",18,,
78,0.97,890.556,909.141,In the vain of what the state Ooregon has already passed which Decriminalizing the possession and clinical use of these substances.,18,,
79,0.97,909.208,933.866,Not seeking to pas seeking to pass it today but looking to put it in front of the Council . and there was also a draft Ordnance brought on by Council Membersawant.,18,,
80,0.97,933.932,947.98,This is something that we've been trying to bring forward . So thank you so much for letting me do kind of a long feed up there.,18,,
81,0.97,948.047,956.755,Also thank you to Council member Herbold for giving us time to discuss this in the Council meeting on Friday.,18,,
82,0.97,956.822,957.956,Thanks so much.,19,,
83,0.97,958.023,969.134,Are there any additional comments on the proposed amendment to the introduction of the referral referral calendar.,19,,
84,0.97,969.201,973.272,Council member Sawant please.,19,,
85,0.97,973.339,995.994,"Thank you, as the as noted as the sponsor of the Ordnance to Decriminalize the use of Psychedelic drugs . I refer any such resolution however I don't understand why when there's an Ordnance in place that the Council is talking about a resolution because a resolution is not on Ordnance.",20,,
86,0.97,996.061,1006.405,If the resolution asks the police to quote Unquote codify policy.,20,,
87,0.97,1006.472,1010.576,Resolutions can only make request they do not accomplish the same thing as a law.,20,,
88,0.97,1010.642,1028.26,"I certainly have, my office has brought forward many resolutions in cases where we haven't been able to do that . But in a case where the city Council has full authority to pass an Ordnance I would prefer to pass an Ordnance.",20,,
89,0.97,1028.327,1047.446,"To Decriminalize Psychedelics it would require an Ordnance and it is the city council that has the authority to pass such an Ordnance not the police . and Yeah just to, refresh the memory of the members of the Publicand those at home who did not know about this.",20,,
90,0.97,1047.513,1055.988,"My office sent for introduction a Council bill, an Ordnance that would have done just that June 29th almost three months ago.",20,,
91,0.97,1056.054,1064.997,It was transmitted to Herbold the chair of the committee . Unfortunately that bill has not come forward.,20,,
92,0.97,1065.063,1067.099,I would certainly support the resolution.,20,,
93,0.97,1067.166,1087.352,"I would prefer that Council members actually pass the Ordnance that would Decriminalize the use of Psychedelics we know there's a huge support for this in the community and especially among the scientific community and from medical and clinical professionals, thank you.",20,,
94,0.97,1087.419,1092.057,"Thank you so member Sawant, Herbold and then Council member Lewis.",21,,
95,0.97,1092.124,1093.492,Thanks so much.,22,,
96,0.97,1093.559,1104.002,I just want to make the point that I appreciate Council member Sawant'S recommendation for legislation.,22,,
97,0.97,1104.069,1140.305,"This resolution is coming on the heels of the Oeir task force organization and it's aligned with their recommendations as we stated in our, stated councils intent to consider the recommendation and this resolution is aligned with the recommendation.",22,,
98,0.97,1140.372,1146.445,We can discuss this when this resolution comes up for final vote.,23,,
99,0.97,1146.512,1167.466,I very much appreciate Council member Sawant's comments because I think there's some scope to pursue the conversation and I think this will put together a road map to put together a plan that is notable to do.,23,,
100,0.97,1167.533,1179.244,"It's taking some time, there actually are some things that are in the scope of the current SPD policy that was done in the wake of blade.",23,,
101,0.97,1179.311,1185.217,For example It's fairly silent on the cultivation of some of these substances.,23,,
102,0.97,1185.284,1191.957,By no stretch am I introducing this resolution today to be the Council's final word in this subject area.,23,,
103,0.97,1192.024,1208.206,It's just that when we're waiting into something as delicate as completely Reconstituting the policy of the city and then hopefully everyone Khully eventually the state.,23,,
104,0.97,1208.273,1213.211,Yes this process has been more complex and much more needing parts than we expected it would be.,23,,
105,0.97,1213.278,1215.414,This is just meant to be the first step.,23,,
106,0.97,1215.48,1218.216,Certainly not meant to be the final word on this.,23,,
107,0.97,1218.283,1226.725,I will reserve most of our Commentsfor the bill instead of putting it on the introduction referral calendar.,23,,
108,0.97,1226.792,1230.495,With that I will stop given that we have a crowded agenda today.,23,,
109,0.97,1230.562,1231.129,We do indeed.,24,,
110,0.97,1231.196,1252.584,Thank you Council member Lewis . I did just want to clarify since Council member Lewis you brought this up sort of as a question in terms of wondering why it wasn't on the intermission referral calendar . just as a reminder the deadline to get legislation on our introduction referral calendar in the Ordnance course of business is actually on Tuesday.,24,,
111,0.97,1252.651,1259.257,We exercise a little bit of grace and let folks get things to us on Wednesday and Thursday.,24,,
112,0.97,1259.324,1265.797,But it looks like we actually received the final resolution for introduction at 5:00 p.m. on Friday.,24,,
113,0.97,1265.864,1287.686,So Unfortunately did not have an opportunity to include it in the regularly published . glad we're able to get the amendment before us so we can continue having this important conversation.,24,,
114,0.97,1287.753,1300.298,So with that being said are there any additional comments . hearing none will the clerk please call the role for the amendment to the introduction and referral calendar.,24,,

655,0.97,5670.965,5674.001,I move to pass Council bill 120157 is there a second?,261,,
656,0.97,5674.068,5674.368,Second.,262,,
657,0.97,5674.435,5675.269,Thank you so much.,263,,
658,0.97,5675.336,5677.304,It's been moved and Seconded to pass the bill.,263,,
659,0.97,5677.371,5690.885,I'm going to hand it over to Council member Strauss who is the sponsor of this bill in order to make comments on the bill.,263,,
660,0.97,5690.951,5719.98,Thank you as this has been discussed on Council briefing to pass the accountability requirement . implemented a new state law that allows for larger buildings and zoning would have other wise allowed for affordable housing developments On-Sites owned or controlled by religious institutions.,264,,
661,0.97,5720.047,5731.592,The state law to fund affordable housing that was transmitted to Council and voted out of the land use and neighborhoods committee.,264,,
662,0.97,5731.659,5735.996,We did in committee require 60% AMI but moved forward without that requirement.,264,,
663,0.97,5736.063,5774.602,The full council as we all know ultimately passed a similar amendment lowering the Affordability requirement following these votes my office and others were contacted by churches and community organizations expressing deep concern with the amendment including from the initiative which works with historically black churches in Seattle to save many black churches on the central area into combat displacement these stake holders threaten the viability of housing projects.,264,,
664,0.97,5774.668,5788.883,I heard that churches had planned to use this Ordnance in ways that are more broadened with the city council reflected.,264,,
665,0.97,5788.949,5797.258,Some of these members may not qualify for 60% AMI and still have been displaced.,264,,
666,0.97,5797.324,5804.398,Also understanding that churches can still have a range of Affordability of the units not all units must be placed up to 80% AMI.,264,,
667,0.97,5804.465,5817.178,At this point I don't believe that city needs to Micromanage how this religious organizations best serve their congregations.,264,,
668,0.97,5817.244,5827.821,"Become pretty much down, I want to say this legislation will amend the Council bill to serve the congregation.",264,,
669,0.97,5827.888,5832.927,Build needed affordable housing so they can continue providing services to their community . Thank you Council President.,264,,
670,0.97,5832.993,5847.541,Thank you so much member Strauss for giving us some initial comments on the bill as introduced as Council big 120127.,265,,
671,0.97,5847.608,5853.147,I do know that folks have comments to make on the under lined bill.,265,,
672,0.97,5853.214,5858.552,We have one more amendment to consider we will go through the amendment.,265,,
673,0.97,5858.619,5859.753,Have a deliberation around the amendment.,265,,
674,0.97,5859.82,5866.527,We'll take a vote on the amendment and then once we know whether the bill is amended or not.,265,,
675,0.97,5866.594,5888.382,We will open up the floor to comments on the general bill . without further adieu I will go ahead and hand it over to Council member Herbold to make her motion on amendment one . and then I will ask if there's a second.,265,,
676,0.97,5888.449,5889.516,& GT;,266,,
677,0.97,5889.583,5894.788,I move to amend bill amendment one which was recently distributed.,267,,
678,0.97,5894.855,5895.256,Second.,268,,
679,0.97,5895.322,5907.635,It's been to amend bill 120127 as presented on amendment one . I will hand it over to Council member Herbold to walk us through amendment one.,269,,
680,0.97,5907.701,5909.603,Thanks so much.,270,,
681,0.97,5909.67,5930.557,So I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this Amendmment . This amendment would allow the higher 80% AMI Renter Affordability threshold in those urban centers and villages as having a high displacement risk.,270,,
682,0.97,5930.624,5939.967,"But should the amendment pass, it would maintain a 60% AMI Renter Affordability threshold in other locations around the city.",270,,
683,0.97,5940.034,5945.773,For some context of what that all means.,270,,
684,0.97,5945.839,5987.981,"60% AMI, a qualifying one person household would pay an affordable rent of $1,452 . A qualifying two person household would pay $1,726 a month for a three bedroom . rented units that are developed on property owned in urban areas and villages with high displacement risk that receive this density bonuses which allows them twice available units would have more permissible Affordability threshold.",270,,
685,0.97,5988.048,6006.6,"Their units could be rented at a rate of a studio, being rented at $1,545 a month and a three bedroom apartment renting at $2,295 a month.",270,,
686,0.97,6006.667,6024.051,That's the description of the amendment just as why I think it's so important I know we talk about the fact that state law permit the maximum 80% AMI affordable threshold.,270,,
687,0.97,6024.118,6028.088,We discussed with the other version of the Ordnance.,270,,
688,0.97,6028.155,6051.779,"I really appreciate hearing the council member Strausss office that the sponsor for the legislation in the state Legislature representative Waylan who represents the 46 District of Bellevue Redmond Kirkman, Medina and hunts point that her legislative intent was that it be at the 80% threshold.",270,,
689,0.97,6051.845,6071.899,"But again, we are no way prohibited from considering the needs of Renters in our cities by lowering the affordable requirements just like we do with other local housing programs that are authorized through the state Legislature for instance enough to eat, there's a higher affordable threshold that we could offer but we don't.",270,,
690,0.97,6071.965,6102.429,"We reduced the Affordability threshold because that's what Renters in our city need . by knowledge no one has demonstrated and I know Council members have asked how a 60% AMI threshold Affordability requirement would thwart the goal of developing, of Incentivizing the development of affordable housing by institution partners.",270,,
691,0.97,6102.496,6107.0,Again the density bonus can increase these parcels by up to double.,270,,
692,0.97,6107.067,6113.64,Former the development performers that we have seen when requested.,270,,
693,0.97,6113.707,6115.976,Take into account the value of itself.,270,,
694,0.97,6116.043,6130.057,If you don't account to the value of land that will lead to a return on investment calculation that looks like a loss.,270,,
695,0.97,6130.123,6146.807,"But you know, whether developers are institutions we do not Needincentivized which are market rate which we allow all religiously owned property throughout the city to develop at 80% AMI.",270,,
696,0.97,6146.874,6163.824,We're actually creating a disincentive for religious institutions to partner with nonprofit developers resulting in fewer rentals out at Aff Ordability rates.,270,,
697,0.97,6163.891,6172.366,The 80% AMI threshold within urban centers and villages as having higher disbursement risk.,270,,
698,0.97,6172.432,6186.713,"This includes the central district, Columbia city, beacon Hill, Rainier Valley and other areas where historic properties can continue to be placed thank you.",270,,
699,0.97,6186.78,6196.323,"Colleagues, any questions on that Amendmment . I see Council member Strauss has his hand up.",271,,
700,0.97,6196.39,6200.36,I absolutely spirit this amendment is brought in.,272,,
701,0.97,6200.427,6212.773,Because you are correct in understanding we have to serve for the poorest among us and 80% AMI does not necessarily do that.,272,,
702,0.97,6212.839,6217.077,This is there are many different avenues with fund housing and AMI throughout the city.,272,,
703,0.97,6217.144,6228.722,But at this point we do not believe that s if appropriate to limit higher Affordability levels only to some urban villages and centers.,272,,
704,0.97,6228.789,6236.33,"These are, lines drawn on streets and the problems that our city faces and those are for zoning specifically.",272,,
705,0.97,6236.396,6263.49,So I have heard of projects and other cities that will be prevented from using this flexibility they're expecting because they are not located in urban villages and centers . I also have not similarly heard when I've reached out to do my stake holding.,272,,
706,0.97,6263.557,6265.525,I only heard opposition.,272,,
707,0.97,6265.592,6267.327,Nothing personal.,272,,
708,0.97,6267.394,6272.265,I am appreciating the spirit of bringing this.,272,,
709,0.97,6272.332,6275.969,Any additional proposed amendment one.,273,,
710,0.97,6276.036,6278.772,Council member Pedersen please.,273,,
711,0.97,6278.839,6310.303,"Thank you and just for the viewing public who might not be as familiar with this legislation, this is we had adopted the Council had adopted legislation and then some groups approached the Mayor's office and wanted to see the legislation changed so the Mayor Resubmitted it to us and because we're going to budget city it's going straight to the budget Council for discussion today.",274,,
712,0.97,6310.37,6319.112,"And I think there were some, I appreciate the points made by both Council members who have spoken.",274,,
713,0.97,6319.179,6329.79,It sort of makes sense that there would be these sort of good ideas floated from the various Council members.,274,,
714,0.97,6329.856,6334.294,I believe that Council member Herbold's amendment is a compromise.,274,,
715,0.97,6334.361,6371.598,"It's basically saying that Okay, even though the original legislation allowed additional time under the higher income 80% AMI that perhaps that wasn't enough time for some churches so, what this amendment is doing is geographically It's saying those churches that did approach Themajor's office and were very vocal about it they would be able to stay at 80% AMI and so I think that this compromise that you know we don't want to make a city wide policy when we don't necessarily we don't need to apply it city wide.",274,,
716,0.97,6371.665,6388.949,It makes sense to apply it geographically as Council member Herbold has done . I will be supporting this amendment.,274,,
717,0.97,6389.015,6390.717,I see Council member Mosqueda's hand is up.,275,,
718,0.97,6390.784,6391.818,Please go ahead.,275,,
719,0.97,6391.885,6398.158,Thank you very member President.,276,,
720,0.97,6398.225,6403.196,Thank you colleagues for the opportunity for showing their support.,276,,
721,0.97,6403.263,6405.999,I will be voting no on this amendment.,276,,
722,0.97,6406.066,6407.033,I do appreciate talking about this more.,276,,
723,0.97,6407.1,6418.945,The last time we talked about it it was one of the hottest days on record for Seattle and many of us were huddled around a fan trying to stay cool on a very hot afternoon.,276,,
724,0.97,6419.012,6432.159,Having a chance to look at the legislation that was passed with the legislation last time . I was a no on the amendment the first time around but having RA chance to reach the amendment and recognizing It's slightly different.,276,,
725,0.97,6432.225,6433.627,Appreciate the nuance that is being woven here.,276,,
726,0.97,6433.693,6441.902,I do want to under score why I am voting no on this even though it is a Tweaked amendment out from the original.,276,,
727,0.97,6441.968,6451.077,I think the bill as transmitted contains several large public benefits by containing the continuity of the AMI levels throughout the city.,276,,
728,0.97,6451.144,6471.865,The first is that maintaining the AMI threshold that 80% means that organizations will have the ability to have the housing dollars to be stretched to go forward.,276,,
729,0.97,6471.932,6480.974,I do think it Thwarts the goal to have more public housing if the threshold were to be lowered to 60% AMI.,276,,
730,0.97,6481.041,6487.414,That means there's fewer funding sources that could be braided together to bring more affordable housing.,276,,
731,0.97,6487.48,6491.918,I know it's our goal as well as the state Legislature.,276,,
732,0.97,6491.985,6508.268,By keeping the 80% AMI threshold at the current level of where it's at we are opening up the availability from more of these religious organizations to be able to access complementary funding sources that are not public Sourcing only.,276,,
733,0.97,6508.335,6514.975,And we can help organizations build this housing that is our over all goal.,276,,
734,0.97,6515.041,6551.745,The initiative also E-Mailed us earlier today showing how if the threshold was lowered to 60% AMI that it would actually thwart the existing projects . We don't want to be in a position where we are in any way even unintentionally reducing the ability for us to build more affordable housing units across our city and they showed how the numbers are not penciled in and leave these projects in the risk.,276,,
735,0.97,6551.811,6568.428,"Number two, the availability to build AMI to build at 80% AMI units will function as an anti displacement policy.",276,,
736,0.97,6568.495,6587.847,This bolsters religious institutions to not only provide housing and it helps us reduce future displacement in working with communities especially our Elders and communities of color who are experiencing higher displacement.,276,,
737,0.97,6587.914,6590.483,"Working with them, keeping the 80% AMI I believe is a win, win.",276,,
738,0.97,6590.55,6597.123,So I will be voting no on this amendment and yes on the underlying bill.,276,,
739,0.97,6597.19,6597.49,Thank you.,277,,
740,0.97,6597.557,6613.573,Council member Mosqueda for those comments I see that Council member Morales has her hand raised so I'm going to hand it over to her.,277,,
741,0.97,6613.64,6617.277,Thank you.,278,,
742,0.97,6617.344,6618.478,I appreciate what trying to establish.,279,,
743,0.97,6618.545,6620.981,This is not something I will be able to support.,279,,
744,0.97,6621.047,6621.481,The amendments that.,279,,
745,0.97,6621.548,6637.564,Mostly because we have heard from a lot of folks in our community who specifically requested we were the underlying legislation was Beingconsidered.,279,,
746,0.97,6637.63,6662.756,Who are waiting for the bill because they do have a project they're waiting to concede with and able to understand it will really limiting to urban villages doesn't provide availability to these institutions.,279,,
747,0.97,6662.822,6680.206,I think it's important that we proceed with the underlying legislation and with the frankly with the original intent of the state sponsor who had passed the 80% AMI which is what advocates had been pushing forward at that level.,279,,
748,0.97,6680.273,6693.353,So I'm aware of the underlying vote but will not be supporting the amendment itself.,279,,
749,0.97,6693.42,6698.925,"Any additional before Council member, you'll have the last word.",280,,
750,0.97,6698.992,6731.991,I'm just looking for any other hands raised on amendment one . I am not seeing any other . The bill before us today does include reporting affordable housing.,280,,
751,0.97,6732.058,6743.937,I have had the opportunity to hear from stake holders representing the interest of black churches in Seattle about the need for flexible without losing sight of our goal around housing.,280,,
752,0.97,6744.003,6768.394,My staff have worked through some of the scenarios with the housing and mayoral staff . and I believe will allow for a future collateral collection . Today I'm going to vote yes on the underlying bill but unfortunately cannot support the proposed Amountment.,280,,
753,0.97,6768.461,6781.708,In doing STO this does not allow the need for ongoing need if the city and every single neighborhood.,280,,
754,0.97,6781.774,6863.356,"Indeed we know that the greatest housing housing needs . and would be would be $1 billion and pencils out to be needing an additional . I have also heard loudly and clearly in the weeks after our initial vote on this Council bill that the city council should forgo the temptation to place the burden of meeting this deep need on the few religious institutions who are in a position to realize affordable housing Communitys in our city . So in the letter for example, that we received today from Michael Ramos the church Council greater Seattle he writes quote generations have lost wealth and assets to Red lining and Colonial housing . The majority of black land based access in Seattle are owned Byhistorically Seattle black churches.",280,,
755,0.97,6863.423,6872.932,It's important that we recognize and consider the ways we may support them to leverage their assets toward community development in the face of ongoing white Supremacist violence.,280,,
756,0.97,6872.999,6887.714,"We must also be mindful of the long term impact providing space for the return of displaced black Renters in a sustainable way that does not contribute to further racial and economic segregation, close quote.",280,,
757,0.97,6887.78,6901.127,I think it is important that we not Institute our judgment . The reality is that before statewide advocacy we would not be considering this housing bill at all.,280,,
758,0.97,6901.194,6911.671,So black church leaders have unequivocally also told us since the passage of a similar amendment that this amendment before us now will similarly tie their hands.,280,,
759,0.97,6911.738,6932.058,In this instance the proposed amendment has the effect of reducing the stake hold and now has a player that could in the words of Donald King from initiative which was recently shared with me.,280,,
760,0.97,6932.125,6938.364,"He wrote, quote I agree that the limit of 60% may be more aligned with most black households.",280,,
761,0.97,6938.431,6961.02,But I still believe that 80% AMI provides for more choice and acknowledgement of the reality and aspirations of black Renters to be considered more Phros Pous.,280,,
762,0.97,6964.023,6969.729,I would like to thank the stake holders who reached out on why this bill was needed without proposed bill one.,280,,
763,0.97,6969.796,6974.167,I encourage my colleagues to also vote no on this proposed amendment.,280,,
764,0.97,6974.233,6995.788,Again since my initial vote I have had deeper conversations about Toperational impact . I think this bill is simply the wrong vehicle to the desired outcome.,280,,
765,0.97,6995.855,7031.991,I believe that voting for the bill before us will help black churches in our city combat anti wheel with that being said I'm going to hold it to Council member Herbold for purposes of closing out debate.,280,,
766,0.97,7032.058,7042.602,I think we're Adisincentive for communities city wide.,281,,
767,0.97,7042.668,7103.996,Something that feels really lost in this conversation . Isthere are 692 parcels throughout the city owned by religious institutions of course not all of them are large enough or have enough space to take advantage of this added housing . to more independent and housing production my amendment was intended to address this directly by allowing more expensive rental housing to be built in those areas where black churches are faced with displacement.,281,,
768,0.97,7104.063,7125.485,Council member Mosqueda you Referenced being able to review Theassumptions underlying the conclusion and the analysis that 60% AMI housing would not pencil out I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to review those assumptions when I have done so.,281,,
769,0.97,7125.551,7126.152,As I mentioned earlier.,281,,
770,0.97,7126.219,7152.912,I saw that the value of the land was not included in the Asufrpbgss assumptions making it look like there was a rate of return on investment that would support the argument that they're not Penciling out . Once you include the value of the land that these bonuses would doubles that not the case.,281,,
771,0.97,7152.979,7170.963,I do want to also under score the point I made this morning that if you look at the data of the 2017 American community survey.,281,,
772,0.97,7171.03,7270.129,80% sorry 80% AMI housing . [Captioner transition],281,,
773,0.97,7306.599,7357.116,"-- I support density, so in my view the--this policy is being described as creating affordable housing--I am very concerned that it will not accomplish that because if today's bill passes and the affordable housing--but just to reiterate some of those points and also to add some other Statistics--talked about how if you bring it up to 80% AMI it essentially becomes like market housing.",282,,

We all know that we need this and I think that by passing this legislation today we continue to underscore that building affordable housing is not on the backs of our community church organizations our religious institutions nor can it all be done on religious property so this is one small but important--I also want to say I am appreciative of the conversation we have had around the AMI levels I think that restoring it to 80% is going to be a Win-Win in both achieving affordable housing and working toward our share goal as counsel to--really does religious organizations do not have to build up to the 80% AMI threshold they can choose a different AMI Affordability level if they want to, but by not requiring them to have a lower amount they can potentially partner with additional affordable housing partners which we have turn heard time and time again--that is language coming directly from them in our conversation so I appreciate that we are taking an important step today and that we have also at the same time and in the same breath are recognizing that this is not going to solve our affordable housing needs and that we are going to continue to work on building more deeply--and like we did last year through Jumpstart progressive revenue in Seattle which focused on 30% AMI that we will continue to focus on more affordable housing and--with more progressive revenue sources at our fingertips soon which as a stand alone are not enough to solve our--across this region so a lot more to do but very excited about this legislation.",286,,

821,0.97,8640.798,8682.306,"If this trend were to continue--40% by the end of this year, imagine getting a 40% increase in your wages, that is unheard of, it is an unimaginable situation for Renters--in the meantime we do need legislation to mitigate the harm that is going to be experienced by Renters because of the skyrocketing rents, and that is what most of the bills today are intended to do.",315,,
822,0.97,8682.373,8710.401,"This bill requires the landlord to provide six months notice for rent increases, currently only two months notice is required--given how difficult it is going to be to find another rental home given how affordable most housing has become--this is also a national phenomenon.",315,,
823,0.97,8710.468,8731.122,Also as I mentioned before this bill as originally requested by--increasing the notice landlords are required to give Renters--it does give Renters the time they will need to find new housing and rearrange their lives when a rent increase forces them to move.,315,,

827,0.97,8829.086,8851.375,On this bill during the committee meeting I proposed an amendment to exempt small landlords as defined as owning four or fewer unions units in the city of Seattle and it failed by a narrow vote.,317,,
828,0.97,8851.442,8884.508,"I do appreciate the intent of this bill in support of helping struggling Renters--we have also adopted several Renters rights bills over the last two years including the winter ban on Evictions, I have heard from many small landlords that the influx of multiple changes to--has created confusion and discourages them from continuing to provide rental housing in Seattle.",317,,
829,0.97,8884.575,8892.583,"Currently we provide 60 days notice so that would triple the time period, one approach would have been to perhaps double that to 120 days and then see how well that worked, but we are tripling it.",317,,
830,0.97,8892.65,8916.107,Regardless I support expanding the notice period for--since that committee meetings nothing substantive have changed in the bill and I have heard from--with concerns so I will be voting no on this bill because it does not exempt the small landlords.,317,,
831,0.97,8916.173,8920.978,Thank you.,317,,
832,0.97,8921.045,8935.559,"Thank you, I am this bill as I did in Committee, in my opinion this bill merely asks a landlord to give a few more months notice of rent increases.",318,,
833,0.97,8935.626,8995.953,"It does not, because state law currently bans rent stabilization this does not prevent a landlord from increasing rent nor does it restrict the amount of an increase but this does mean that landlords have to wait a short amount of time before implementing an increase, the more important piece of this bill for me is that it means tenants have adequate time to find a new job, new housing, to deal with Childcare issues that may be present as a result of this change or to make any other number of adjustments that may be necessary so that they can pay for a rent increase or make the plans to move out and to find something that is more affordable, so I think this is a relatively small ask from the landlords but could have a really acute impact and meaningful impact for tenants, so I will be supporting the legislation.",318,,
834,0.97,8996.02,9012.036,"Thank you, are there other comments on the bill? I am not seeing any hands raised, Councilmember Sawant anything else you would like to say in closing?",319,,

844,0.97,9118.542,9224.915,"Thank you, this is second bill from my office in helping to address the crisis Renters face with--it will require a landlord to provide relocation assistance when they--we know that over the past decade there has been massive displacement and Gentrification of our neighborhoods particularly--and we also know that--with every $100 increase in average rents proving to lead to an increase of 15% of homelessness--we have seen the Statistics of the rent increase in Seattle already being 25% and we are seeing the effects, the Seattle times reported--behind on their rent, and it is obviously showing the combined fact of the rents having increased so dramatically over so many years and on top of that having the prices of the pandemic and economic collapse all of that landing on Renters, and it shows that--are behind on their rent, most of whom Oh more than one month back rent, and this is a serious crisis in the making, imagine 60,000 more people facing the prospect of housing instability including homelessness when the Eviction moratorium ends, and in the meantime rents are still going to go up unless rent control is established citywide and statewide.",327,,
845,0.97,9224.982,9276.867,"And also we should note that this kind of out of control rent and housing cost is not some act of God, it is not inevitable, it happens because of the way that For-Profit market functions and it is driven by macro economic factors, it is primarily wing driven by ballooning real estate speculation, the cost of real estate housing goes higher and higher because investors--who believe they will get to sell it for even more in the future and then--to charge the artificially inflated inflated markets--overall it leads leaves fewer and fewer affordable choices in terms of housing.",327,,

848,0.97,9343.634,9357.147,Under this bill if you are a Renter and your landlord RAISES the bill by 10% or anything higher than that and you are forced to move then you are eligible for assistance up to three months of rent.,327,,
849,0.97,9357.214,9376.867,The payment goes to the Seattle Department of construction and inspections who--any Renter who has tried to get back their security deposit from their landlord knows how impossible to deal with that power imbalance can be.,327,,
850,0.97,9376.934,9456.647,"If the landlord does not Gouge their Renter and does not raise the rent astronomically which is true for most small landlords they do not have to pay relocation assistance, so--and is not forced to move then there is no question that--regardless of the size of the rent increase, but when both happen, that is when the landlord increases the rent by 10% or more and though tenant is forced to move as a result that is when the landlord needs to pay relocation assistance--if there is a large rent increase that causes one roommate to move and the other can afford to stay--I really appreciate all the work of--as well as the Seattle Department of construction and inspections as well as the staff of the city attorney's office all of whom did hard work over months to make sure that--to make sure that this program was up and functioning if this ordinance were to pass by the Council.",327,,
