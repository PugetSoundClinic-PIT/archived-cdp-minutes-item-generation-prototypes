334,0.97,3269.299,3272.202,This is something we heard a lot about in the community meeting last week.,90,,
335,0.97,3272.202,3299.229,"It not only adds a commitment by the city and vaccine Dividers to collect this information, but also makes a commitment that we will analyze the data in collaboration with public health and Washington's Department of health and analyze the data in the goal of using that analysis to identify and close gaps in vaccine distribution.",90,,
336,0.97,3299.229,3330.794,"Our offices received a letter from a collective of organization signed by dozens of community organizations and members urging specific actions to address inequity including the state to track race, share the data publicly and use it to monitor and ensure ongoing equitable vaccine access with the disparities in infection rates.",90,,

347,0.97,3432.529,3438.101,It was really informative.,94,,
348,0.97,3438.101,3445.442,I know we meet with this group a lot but it is another thing when we are laser focused on something as urgent as a pandemic.,94,,
349,0.97,3445.442,3458.354,I particularly appreciated the Seattle health board as they show community responsibility.,94,,
350,0.97,3458.354,3468.398,"We heard loud and clear across panelists that as counsel, we must identify ways of who we are, shifting power and resources to the community.",94,,
351,0.97,3468.398,3486.115,"In addition we learned that as organizations adapt and meet community needs, resources need to be flexible for our transient, those who are on sheltered and those who don't often find themselves at the city hall.",94,,
352,0.97,3486.115,3497.06,"And I also think we heard loud and clear, like we do anytime we do immunity outreach, we have to rely on trusted community members.",94,,
353,0.97,3497.06,3508.037,"And I want to thank again, the Ceo of the health board for bringing us closer to that reality of how that works and how well it is done.",94,,
354,0.97,3508.037,3523.253,As I've shared the health board and our office have contributed to this resolution and we appreciate the Councilmember President support in this,94,,

359,0.97,3557.787,3563.993,I think it Complemented many of the calls and letters that many of us have received over the last few months.,96,,
360,0.97,3563.993,3589.018,"I also appreciated hearing directly from the public health officials who were on the line and the committee that also had a chance to comment on the fact that we have Continuingly seen the decline as the public health infrastructure has eroded, leaving us in a very vulnerable situation for crises like this.",96,,
361,0.97,3589.018,3606.703,"And when we are left in a vulnerable situation and the health infrastructure doesn't have the resources it needs, the very inequities we see everyday become exacerbated during the Panda pandemic such as we see in Covid.",96,,
362,0.97,3606.703,3612.842,Most front-line workers are more likely to be women or people of color.,96,,
363,0.97,3612.842,3624.12,There have been precarious situations in compounding health crises and they are also more likely to be people of color.,96,,
364,0.97,3624.12,3642.972,"And those who have been without access to Healthcare and regular routine Preventative treatment, all of these compounding inequities come to bear when in a pandemic like this.",96,,
365,0.97,3642.972,3656.953,It really brings to light that the pandemic is just the sort of tip of the iceberg in all the ways in which our health system must be reformed to truly be a more equitable system.,96,,
366,0.97,3656.953,3689.619,"I really want to applaud the work that the community health clinics have done, community health systems, the community health board coalition, Casa Latina and ARS and many more who have done tremendous work to make sure they are getting the resources out, especially to the elderly community and to individuals that speak English as a second language.",96,,
367,0.97,3689.619,3698.027,To make sure that at the very least we are sharing resources and are able to give the public a sense of direction and hope of when there will be vaccines.,96,,
368,0.97,3698.027,3710.206,"But the underlying lack of vaccines at the Federal level, the outright lies of the Trump administration have left many of us scrambling for a solution.",96,,
369,0.97,3710.206,3719.015,"We can do better, we have light in so many ways as it relates to responding to Covid.",96,,
370,0.97,3719.015,3732.929,I really applaud the resolutions effort to make sure vaccine distribution does not further exacerbate the same inequities we have seen play out in many of the systems that have left far too many behind and far too many left out.,96,,
371,0.97,3732.929,3749.178,Seattle has an opportunity to do better by investing our resources to support equitable resources for vaccines.,96,,
372,0.97,3749.178,3760.757,"At the community briefing they talked about how they are the very fabric of the safety net system that is ready to deploy vaccines, not just in bilingual ways but in cultural ways.",96,,
373,0.97,3760.757,3765.294,So I am really looking forward to our community partnership.,96,,
374,0.97,3765.294,3781.31,I think the resolution and in calling for this partnership with state to ensure that distribution of vaccines will be equitable and will help Seattle again be a leader.,96,,
375,0.97,3781.31,3798.694,In responding to these crises and crises we know are just below the surface in our Healthcare system that is not allowing for individuals to have year-round access to Healthcare.,96,,
376,0.97,3798.694,3812.041,I look forward to continuing to work with you as we continue to focus on health and economic recovery.,96,,
