68,0.97,395.261,403.669,This progress report that we're asking for approval provides Foundational information that is going to guide future resource decisions.,13,,
69,0.97,403.669,420.186,It is important because this is going to set the stage for valuable public and stake holder engagement to keep us and the customers in step with one another as we plan for the future in this new energy frontier that we're entering.,13,,
70,0.97,420.186,441.04,So we look forward to working with you and the public on our 2022 Irp and we appreciate the opportunity to have presented in the last meeting two weeks ago and are available for questions as they come up about how city light is planning for the future.,13,,

74,0.97,453.119,465.131,"You know, we added questions to our summary and fiscal note to ask about climate change, about emissions, but also adaptability, about our resiliency to climate change that we're in the mist of now.",14,,

79,0.97,501.901,502.168,Anybody?,14,,
80,0.97,502.168,506.572,I want to extend my thanks.,15,,
81,0.97,506.572,601.467,"We are currently all witnessing happening in terms of the failure of the grid in Texas is just absolutely--I am so grateful that we have a publicly owned utility that is highly accountable, highly transparent, and has been in my years of service, always very prepared in terms of their planning and really just grateful for our entire city that we are such a strong publicly owned utility that I have a high level of confidence and I think the people of the city of Seattle should have a high level of confidence that we have plans in place to prevent a complete failure of our electrical grid here and I know this is at the top of mind for many folks in our city and I would just sort of invite anyone else from Seattle city light to maybe just share with us a couple of quick sentences with your indulgence, chair Pedersen, about how the utility is positioned well to avoid that kind of a crisis here in our own city as I think it's important for folks in the city to hear directly from the utility about how we are positioned to avoid that kind of complete breakdown in our electrical grid.",15,,
82,0.97,601.467,603.936,"Thank you, council member Gonzalez.",16,,
83,0.97,603.936,612.511,"I will let Aliza take that question, since that's what her group does, resource planning and ensuring we are prepared for today as well as the future.",16,,
84,0.97,612.511,621.02,I would say that it is a Multistep process in terms of city light.,17,,
85,0.97,621.02,649.715,"It's not just integrated resource plan process, there's also a lot of planning that goes on at the utility, at the distribution planning side that gets brought into making sure that we have a solid distribution grid as well as transmission planning to make sure that we have the necessary Interconnections with other utilities and then looking at our generation power supply and how that also is secure.",17,,
86,0.97,649.715,652.151,So it's a multistage process.,17,,
87,0.97,652.151,655.821,The Irp brings a lot of components together.,17,,
88,0.97,655.821,664.897,City light also through its strategic planning process is looking at overall to make sure that the city light is well positioned for the future.,17,,
89,0.97,664.897,677.243,And so I can assure you that this is front and center in the minds of folks at City light as we see these issues coming up.,17,,
90,0.97,677.243,699.465,It is difficult with climate change and changing weather that we have a strong commitment to being ready for climate adaptation and people focused within the utility on that to help us bring that data that we need to help prepare for the future.,17,,
91,0.97,699.465,714.78,"And the decision making, it's very important to make the decisions going forward on how we should be set up with our governing body and our public.",17,,
92,0.97,714.78,715.281,Thank you.,18,,
93,0.97,715.281,724.29,"Thank you for putting that point on there, Councilperson Gonzalez.",18,,

115,0.97,817.449,827.293,Voters Overwelmingly approved funds for our Seattle transportation benefit district and we're now considering the updated transit service agreement with King County Metro for bus service.,30,,
116,0.97,827.293,833.299,"The transit service agreement as we know, spells out terms of enhanced bus service throughout Seattle.",30,,
117,0.97,833.299,865.764,"Our agreement is important as we allocate bus service hours to get more people back on buses as our economy recovers and as our regional transportation network grows with the opening of new sound transit stations, including two in district 4 and of course North gate station in district 5. last Thursday, our city council central staff transportation expert, Calvin, circulated his memo analyzing the agreement, that is Online with the materials today.",30,,
118,0.97,865.764,866.031,His memo.,30,,
119,0.97,866.031,875.841,This same item is on the consent calendar at King County Council because it is considered noncontroversial.,30,,
120,0.97,875.841,887.553,The Since-Year agreement is the boilerplate frame work updating the existing servicing agreement we have used for the past six years with some slight modifications that we'll discuss today.,30,,

127,0.97,928.294,928.927,So you can go forward.,31,,
128,0.97,928.927,941.307,We're going to talk about a couple of things here and this kicks off a couple of Council committee meetings that we'll focus on STBD overall.,31,,
129,0.97,941.307,954.72,"Today we are talking about the implementation of the voter approved initiative from November and we'll talk about the implementation time line, the funding agreement which is in front of you today.",31,,
130,0.97,954.72,959.391,"A little bit about our spend plan, and then some of the next steps.",31,,
131,0.97,959.391,963.929,You can go on to the next slide.,31,,
132,0.97,963.929,972.104,"After today, we have a couple other things that we're going to come back and talk to you about, STBD related.",31,,
133,0.97,972.104,975.941,"As a reminder, the STBD was established in 2010.",31,,
134,0.97,975.941,982.214,Transit service improvements as well as maintenance and a broad range of transportation projects overall.,31,,
135,0.97,982.214,985.951,There are two funding sources that we use.,31,,
136,0.97,985.951,992.324,There's a sales and use tax which was the subject of the voter approved initiative back in November.,31,,
137,0.97,992.324,996.995,There's also the vehicle license fee.,31,,
138,0.97,996.995,1007.573,"The first proposition one transit measure expired at the end of last year, and today's focus is on the 2020 voter approved .15% sales tax.",31,,
139,0.97,1007.573,1013.379,"Or 15 cents on $100 purchase, that is focused on transit Servic improvements.",31,,
140,0.97,1013.379,1027.96,"And so I'll turn it over to bill, and Briana to talk some of the details of this transit service agreement and how we will end up utilizing those voter approved sources going forward.",31,,
141,0.97,1027.96,1029.261,"Bill, take it away.",31,,
142,0.97,1029.261,1032.564,"Thank you, Sam.",32,,
143,0.97,1032.564,1032.998,"Next slide, please.",32,,
144,0.97,1032.998,1040.906,This slide covers a lot of the same ground that is covered in the central staff memo.,32,,
145,0.97,1040.906,1048.547,"The contract goes into effect if approved by you today, on March 20, which is the next service change for Metro.",32,,
146,0.97,1048.547,1053.919,And it would expire at the end of 2027.,32,,
147,0.97,1053.919,1060.392,Allowing extra time for Rampdown and contract closeout at the end of 2027.,32,,
148,0.97,1060.392,1070.035,"Under the agreement, Metro just talking a little bit about how Metro prices the service and how that is Layed out in the agreement.",32,,
149,0.97,1070.035,1080.479,Metro estimates the cost of fixed route bus service for the year based on their adopted budget and number of service hours that the city intends to purchase.,32,,
150,0.97,1080.479,1102.668,"We pay a per hour service hour fully allocated cost that reflects Metro's cost of operating fixed route services, whether that's for Metro's regular service, for sound transit Express, or for service that the city of Seattle is purchasing through the STBD.",32,,
151,0.97,1102.668,1124.289,"The fully allocated cost is, I think of it as it is Metro essentially providing the service for us at their cost and so that operating cost includes operator wages and benefits, fuel, bus maintenance, related to the service we're purchasing.",32,,
152,0.97,1124.289,1133.532,"Some overhead, including planning costs, hr support, and legal support.",32,,
153,0.97,1133.532,1156.388,"Also we get about, historically, a 25% discount off of that fully allocated rate reflecting return, fair box credit, and we also pay capitalized cost for whatever additional buses Metro might need to purchase to cover Peek hour service that the city is purchasing.",32,,
154,0.97,1156.388,1159.825,That was a pretty significant issue with the last agreement.,32,,
155,0.97,1159.825,1166.665,That is less likely to be an issue for the first two to three years of this agreement.,32,,
156,0.97,1166.665,1172.304,Metro invoices us on a quarterly based on the estimates of that allocated cost.,32,,
157,0.97,1172.304,1180.145,"At the end of each year, we reconcile.",32,,
158,0.97,1180.145,1183.882,And these provisions are all detailed in section 5 of the agreement.,32,,
159,0.97,1183.882,1204.269,"A couple other things to note about the basic terms of the agreement is as in prop 1, where we made a commitment to the voters that this service would not--Metro is already providing or would provide without STBD involvement.",32,,
160,0.97,1204.269,1216.748,The contract in section 7 addresses supplementation and Úessentially says we will not B purchasing service that Supplants what Metro would otherwise provide.,32,,
161,0.97,1216.748,1230.996,"We have some new terms in that section primarily addressing supplementation in a service cuts, that dominated much of the past six years.",32,,
162,0.97,1230.996,1249.615,"One other provision I want to note is that there's a ramp Downprovision in the agreement and that prevents the city potentially in an emergency from cutting more than 100,000 hours of service at a time.",32,,
163,0.97,1249.615,1267.332,"So basically, it requires us to ramp down over two service change periods, down to zero at the end of this agreement or if there's a transition to our regional County funded service plan.",32,,
164,0.97,1267.332,1267.766,"Next slide, please.",32,,
165,0.97,1267.766,1277.943,The other thing I want to mention about the agreement is several provisions in section 5.7 that help address the kinds of cross pressures.,32,,
166,0.97,1277.943,1287.252,Some moderate ones that we saw Precovid and then some that were elevated during the Covid response.,32,,
167,0.97,1287.252,1293.425,"So during Covid, service was suddenly reduced.",32,,
168,0.97,1293.425,1299.364,Operators were not all operators were able to make their shifts.,32,,
169,0.97,1299.364,1307.272,"Trips were cut, including trips that the city was purchasing.",32,,
170,0.97,1307.272,1318.05,"And there were immediate cuts in cost, including fuel that wasn't being purchased, buses that didn't need to be maintained as much because they weren't making as many trips.",32,,
171,0.97,1318.05,1331.563,"But at the same time, it took several months for a lot of those cost reductions to reflect the reductions in service.",32,,
172,0.97,1331.563,1344.176,"Metro has cut several operator positions, but there is quite a lag through the end of 2020 and into 2021 and even 2022.",32,,
173,0.97,1344.176,1350.515,We're probably paying more than we would otherwise be paying without the Covid response.,32,,
174,0.97,1350.515,1359.124,And the biggest factor there was the loss of fair box return as Metro was not collecting fares for several months of the year in 2020.,32,,
175,0.97,1359.124,1374.84,"So we try to address those emergency situations by requiring Metro to disclose to the city as quickly as possible when they are seeing impacts on costs that might affect the amount of service, the service quality that the city can provide.",32,,
176,0.97,1374.84,1391.523,We also have a provision in the agreement that addresses the distribution of cares act or other Covid relief funding that the Federal Government may provide.,32,,
177,0.97,1391.523,1395.36,"And finally, there's a commitment by Metro to cut costs.",32,,
178,0.97,1395.36,1398.163,We were seeing costs Precovid going up about 5% a year.,32,,
179,0.97,1398.163,1423.054,"So a little bit higher than CPI and both in the county executive commitment to the Mayor and in the agreement itself, there's a commitment by Metro to help alleviate those increases above inflation that we were seeing in the years before Covid.",32,,
180,0.97,1423.054,1439.304,And I'll hand it over to Briana Lovell who will talk about the service plan and service planning.,32,,
181,0.97,1439.304,1441.807,"Thanks, bill.",33,,
182,0.97,1441.807,1444.276,So this slide shows overall process --,33,,
183,0.97,1444.276,1452.384,"Briana, we are having trouble hearing you.",34,,
184,0.97,1452.384,1453.785,Your Audio.,34,,
185,0.97,1453.785,1454.619,That's not working either.,34,,
186,0.97,1454.619,1458.523,Can you hear me?,35,,
187,0.97,1458.523,1460.358,Not very well.,36,,
188,0.97,1460.358,1466.431,You sound very far away.,36,,
189,0.97,1466.431,1467.432,Worked okay in testing.,37,,
190,0.97,1467.432,1477.943,I'm still not hearing you.,38,,
191,0.97,1479.177,1479.845,Maybe without the Headset?,38,,
192,0.97,1479.845,1483.215,Your neighbors are going to hear you.,38,,
193,0.97,1483.215,1490.255,I might turn off my camera --,39,,
194,0.97,1490.255,1490.622,That works.,40,,
195,0.97,1490.622,1496.261,"All right, sorry about that.",41,,
196,0.97,1496.261,1503.501,So this slide shows the process that we use to coordinate with Metro.,41,,
197,0.97,1503.501,1509.241,"We used this process since 2016, but the new contracts clarifies the timing.",41,,
198,0.97,1509.241,1514.346,So the process really starts six months in advance of the service change.,41,,
199,0.97,1514.346,1516.448,Metro has two annual service changes.,41,,
200,0.97,1516.448,1520.085,One in September and one in March.,41,,
201,0.97,1520.085,1527.692,"So six months in advance of that date, we let Metro know what our initial service proposal is.",41,,
202,0.97,1527.692,1544.075,They review what we've proposed and then they bring that information together with their own service plans to review for operational feasibility and to make sure that everything will be able to work cohesively.,41,,
203,0.97,1544.075,1556.855,"And then by four months in the planning process, we have essentially a finalized service package, which allows Metro to move into scheduling and arranging operational staffing.",41,,
204,0.97,1556.855,1576.308,"But I will note that in reality, there's a huge amount of collaboration that occurs throughout the process, even well in advance of that month one and all throughout the process up until the date of the service change.",41,,
205,0.97,1576.308,1592.324,"And continuing our really great relationships with Metro, we have bee able to solve a lot of problems that come up in this process at the staff level.",41,,
206,0.97,1592.324,1592.657,Next slide.,41,,
207,0.97,1592.657,1601.132,"So, this slide shows the overall transit service investments that are planned for the measure.",41,,
208,0.97,1601.132,1608.54,There's a total of $238.6 million in transit service purchases over the seven years.,41,,
209,0.97,1608.54,1612.31,Noting that the 2021 revenue collection begins in April.,41,,
210,0.97,1612.31,1621.453,So the first quarter of expenditures for this year are covered as part of the prior STBD measure.,41,,
211,0.97,1621.453,1627.459,Regular transit service purchases are shown on dark blue.,41,,
212,0.97,1627.459,1639.838,"Light blue is part of the emerging needs bucket, which is focused on transit service, supporting West Seattle during the bridge closure and also on transit recovery post Covid.",41,,
213,0.97,1639.838,1652.917,"This slide doesn't include the expenditures for our program investments or opportunity, low income access to transit, the essential workers program, and also transit capital.",41,,
214,0.97,1652.917,1664.229,But it does show service Ramping up over the life of the measure with a planned ramp down or transition period in 2027.,41,,
215,0.97,1664.229,1669.0,"And with that, I'll pass it back to Sam.",41,,
216,0.97,1669.0,1669.634,"Great, thanks, Briana.",42,,
217,0.97,1669.634,1674.906,Just to wrap up and then turn it over for happy to answer questions.,42,,
218,0.97,1674.906,1684.582,"But again, this is part of a couple months of very STBD intensive work with the committee.",42,,
219,0.97,1684.582,1699.33,"Today, we're focused on the ordinance authorizing the transit service funding agreement in March we'll be bringing forward a stand alone budget legislation for one time, $6 vehicle license fee.",42,,
220,0.97,1699.33,1718.75,These are some of the reserves and balances that were left over at the end of the previous ballot initiative and held in reserve in case of an unsuccessful balance initiative 976.,42,,
221,0.97,1718.75,1731.963,"In March 20, mid March, the new funding service transit service funding agreement will be in effect as Metro goes into their next service change, assuming successful process here.",42,,
222,0.97,1731.963,1749.314,"And then in April, we'll be proposing a new spending plan for a new $20 vehicle license fee that was approved as part of the budget that will go into effect July 1. so there's a lot of moving pieces.",42,,
223,0.97,1749.314,1752.917,This puzzle piece diagram is getting a workout within S-Dot.,42,,
224,0.97,1752.917,1768.566,But wanted to make sure that we talked about this in the context of some of these larger pieces that are coming forward and remaining focused right now on the limitation of proposition one from November.,42,,
225,0.97,1768.566,1777.408,"So with that, we're all happy to answer any questions you might have.",42,,
226,0.97,1777.408,1778.943,Thank you director Zimbabwe.,43,,
227,0.97,1778.943,1780.245,Today is the easy part.,43,,
228,0.97,1780.245,1786.951,"Today is the transit service agreement, which is over at King County Council and on their consent calendar.",43,,
229,0.97,1786.951,1794.626,"We have open lines of communication with general manager Terri white, who is terrific to work with.",43,,
230,0.97,1794.626,1800.265,"Council member King County Council member, who chairs their mobility committee.",43,,
231,0.97,1800.265,1829.127,"But we have a strong transit team within S-Dot to make sure that these investments are made wisely and to benefit the most people and have great confidence in them to keep their eye on things for us and make sure the transit service agreement is implemented appropriately and this is something that we visit on an annual basis as well, when we look at investments in transit.",43,,
232,0.97,1829.127,1839.17,"So you know, as the light rail stations open up, for example, and there needs to be Tweaks, those can be made later.",43,,
233,0.97,1839.17,1840.305,We have agreement relations with Metro.,43,,
234,0.97,1840.305,1844.108,This agreement is even better than the good agreement we already had in place with them.,43,,
235,0.97,1844.108,1853.284,There was a lot learned during the Covid pandemic when we were trying to get information during an extraordinary event.,43,,
236,0.97,1853.284,1858.823,So this transit service agreement increases transparency and accountability during extraordinary events.,43,,
237,0.97,1858.823,1877.308,"We also look forward to not only working with King County Metro within this framework, but potentially four years from now looking at another regional measure, because this is the regional system we are trying to work within.",43,,
238,0.97,1877.308,1883.381,"Calvin chow, expert on transportation wrote the Two- page memo, which is Online.",43,,
239,0.97,1883.381,1887.352,Which Validates the benefits of this agreement.,43,,
240,0.97,1887.352,1887.719,Calvin is here.,43,,
241,0.97,1887.719,1892.957,"So Calvin, do you want to say a few words before we want to open it up to Council members for questions?",43,,
242,0.97,1892.957,1895.326,I don't think I have too much else to add.,44,,
243,0.97,1895.326,1899.163,Just to remind you that you did pass the budget for 2021 in the last budget.,44,,
244,0.97,1899.163,1906.471,"As you say, the future spending decisions will come to you again with the annual budgeting process.",44,,
245,0.97,1906.471,1918.082,"So this agreement sets the vehicle for making those purchases, but the policy decisions about how much service and the spending plans will come to you again as part of the future budget deliberations.",44,,
246,0.97,1918.082,1919.284,"Thank you, Calvin.",45,,
247,0.97,1919.284,1925.59,"I always appreciate the pun vehicle, which is appropriate here.",45,,
248,0.97,1925.59,1934.832,"So Council member and vice chair is here with us as well, who is already very familiar with this transit service agreement in place already and the new one before us.",45,,
249,0.97,1934.832,1944.909,"But Council members, I want to open it up for any questions or comments on this before we take a vote.",45,,
250,0.97,1944.909,1945.81,Chairman Pedersen.,46,,
251,0.97,1945.81,1946.044,Yes.,47,,
252,0.97,1946.044,1949.347,"Thank you all, my apologies for being late.",48,,
253,0.97,1949.347,1950.581,A 9:00 to 10:00 A.M.,48,,
254,0.97,1950.581,1953.818,Meeting where we discussed some of your programs.,48,,
255,0.97,1953.818,1959.29,"I was just wondering, thank you for the briefing ahead of this meeting.",48,,
256,0.97,1959.29,1968.733,"I don't know if bill or Briana, you can speak.",48,,
257,0.97,1968.733,1976.107,"On slide four, my apologies.",48,,
258,0.97,1976.107,1985.316,"If you have already answered this for the committee, the questions that I will ask, please feel free to just say we already covered this.",48,,
259,0.97,1985.316,1991.556,We probably have not.,49,,
260,0.97,1991.556,1991.856,It's okay.,49,,
261,0.97,1991.856,1999.731,"So, slide 4, ramp down, I had my questions answered about that.",50,,
262,0.97,1999.731,2000.264,No supplementation.,50,,
263,0.97,2000.264,2001.466,"Oh, the intended volume of services.",50,,
264,0.97,2001.466,2030.628,"My question that I talked to bill about was, does this include the routes like the 5X, the 17X, 18X, 15X, how does this as people begin to work downtown again, how will we ensure some of these routes that have fallen off due to Ridership levels, how will we ensure they come back?",50,,
265,0.97,2030.628,2039.904,"I'll let Briana answer that, since she's the one that leads the service purchase decisions.",51,,
266,0.97,2039.904,2041.639,Each service change period.,51,,
267,0.97,2041.639,2043.808,"Sure, Yeah, thanks, bill.",52,,
268,0.97,2043.808,2073.137,So we are working really closely with Metro to understand what their planning in terms of service restoration and right now what we're really focused on is the September 2021 service change and we're still in the process of identifying what investments STBD will make and also understanding Metro's process for bringing it back service that has been suspended during Covid.,52,,
269,0.97,2073.137,2084.749,"There's a little bit of inner play there and Metro really is the, you know, the entity that is running the vast majority of the system.",52,,
270,0.97,2084.749,2111.476,"But we'll be trying to be very strategic with our investments from the STBD standpoint to support Covid recovery, but also making sure to maintain the investments and the frequent service network that have been the bulk of our focus in the previous measure and continue to be our focus going forward.",52,,
271,0.97,2111.476,2124.655,"One thing I'll add to that, I think what Briana described in the service planning process that we go through twice a year, is a process with Metro staff.",53,,
272,0.97,2124.655,2152.65,"We are trying to understand what service they are putting on the road and where we can most effectively fill in gaps or enhance service based on demand, on maintaining our frequent transit network, on equity, as we dig into that question for the September service change through our racial equity tool kit that is already underway.",53,,
273,0.97,2152.65,2163.194,"And you know, we really try to bring our values as well as understanding what Metro is already providing in the service we're purchasing.",53,,
274,0.97,2163.194,2173.538,"If I could add also that we also know that transit use, continued use of transit during the pandemic has been different depending on different routes across the city.",54,,
275,0.97,2173.538,2183.648,"As things come back, we expect that to Fluxuate as well, and that's part of the service planning process, to figure out how best to allocate those resources.",54,,
276,0.97,2183.648,2194.559,This ensures that the funding ensures we have some resources with which to fill the gaps.,54,,
277,0.97,2194.559,2195.96,"Great, thank you.",55,,
278,0.97,2195.96,2196.327,That answers.,55,,
279,0.97,2196.327,2200.264,"Chairman, I have questions on three slides.",55,,
280,0.97,2200.264,2200.665,"Yes, please.",56,,
281,0.97,2200.665,2201.032,Excellent.,57,,
282,0.97,2201.032,2215.913,"So the next questions are on 5, 7, and then 8. great, so on slide 5, I know that when we had conversations ahead of this meeting, there was a discussion about purchasing of new coaches.",57,,
283,0.97,2215.913,2221.485,I just wanted to clarify.,57,,
284,0.97,2221.485,2226.757,"Is the city purchasing coaches, are we leasing coaches from Metro?",57,,
285,0.97,2226.757,2238.002,How are we better able to expand with the coaches themselves?,57,,
286,0.97,2238.002,2244.308,"So, I'll try to start with an answer to that question.",58,,
287,0.97,2244.308,2251.983,The purchase of coaches really becomes an issue with peak hour service.,58,,
288,0.97,2251.983,2254.085,Otherwise Metro's existing fleet is adequate.,58,,
289,0.97,2254.085,2267.531,"And for peak hours, probably for the next couple of years, their existing fleet will adequately cover peak hours as well.",58,,
290,0.97,2267.531,2279.076,"In the previous six years, Precovid, we were--Metro wouldn't have been able to provide additional peak hour service if we hadn't been able to fund the purchase of coaches.",58,,
291,0.97,2279.076,2308.506,"The way that worked is we essentially paid a capitalized rate, or must work like a lease rate, where we were paying for the use of those coaches on a quarterly basis during the time, you know, following their purchase and we would only pay more if we're causing Metro to buy more coaches.",58,,
292,0.97,2308.506,2309.073,"Great, thanks.",59,,
293,0.97,2309.073,2316.347,So what I'm hearing it's really the peak hours that are our level of service issues.,59,,
294,0.97,2316.347,2327.658,"So I guess my question is, understanding that and my question comes from an understanding of Prepandemic where we had the number of cars on the road that caused a lot of traffic.",59,,
295,0.97,2327.658,2338.569,"If we were able to create a connected network of bus only lanes through the city, would that reduce our need to purchase coaches?",59,,
296,0.97,2338.569,2339.17,Would it reduce any costs?,59,,
297,0.97,2339.17,2348.679,And would it increase the level of service that we experience for the same or fewer dollars than we're spending?,59,,
298,0.97,2348.679,2360.291,"Definitely, by and large, improve quality of service and that rider service.",60,,
299,0.97,2360.291,2363.094,It would probably temper costs.,60,,
300,0.97,2363.094,2364.228,Alleviate costs increases.,60,,
301,0.97,2364.228,2380.344,"You know, I couldn't say there would be massive wholesale costs and cuts, but it would certainly push things in a good direction in terms of cost to have a reliable bus only network.",60,,
302,0.97,2380.344,2380.678,Or efforts.,60,,
303,0.97,2380.678,2381.045,Thank you.,61,,
304,0.97,2381.045,2406.17,"I would just add to that, that it really depends on the efficacy of the transit Lane network because you don't start to see a real cost savings until Metro can actually take a whole trip out of the schedule so the time Savings has to really roll up into a meaningful Incriminate.",62,,
305,0.97,2406.17,2415.78,"But if it does, there's potential to be able to basically buy more service with the same resources if we're able to speed up the service.",62,,
306,0.97,2415.78,2435.399,"So when I would see the four or five 40 buses stuck on West Lake, that would be a place that we might not--we could reduce a trip because the trips are all getting jammed together as the system was operating before.",63,,
307,0.97,2435.399,2439.036,Úis that a correct understanding?,63,,
308,0.97,2439.036,2446.811,We could reduce cost as long as we could reduce the number of trips required by increasing frequency.,63,,
309,0.97,2446.811,2453.284,"I think that's fair, it's hard to quantify a little bit as Briana said.",64,,
310,0.97,2453.284,2467.998,"And I think on that front, we have shared interest in making our transit investments efficient, reliable, and speedy.",64,,
311,0.97,2467.998,2476.607,"Really that goes back to the rider experience that attracts people to transit, and also gets the most out of our shared investments in transit service.",64,,
312,0.97,2476.607,2483.948,I think this also brings up that same issue of how is the economy going to recover?,65,,
313,0.97,2483.948,2486.417,What does it look like going forward?,65,,
314,0.97,2486.417,2491.455,Do they back to the same peak dependent traffic patterns and transit patterns?,65,,
315,0.97,2491.455,2495.326,Or is it something different?,65,,
316,0.97,2495.326,2502.433,Metro currently has the capital capacity to handle this lower level that we anticipate for the near future.,65,,
317,0.97,2502.433,2511.675,"It's really an open question of what that looks like five, ten years further down the line.",65,,
318,0.97,2511.675,2515.446,"Councilmember Strauss, we may have other questions about this slide, which is jam packed with information.",66,,
319,0.97,2515.446,2520.451,Are we able to see if we have other questions about this before we go back to your other questions?,66,,
320,0.97,2520.451,2523.254,This is all my questions for slide five.,67,,
321,0.97,2523.254,2530.194,"Okay, Council members, any questions for this slide?",68,,
322,0.97,2530.194,2531.495,Council President Gonzalez.,68,,
323,0.97,2531.495,2533.731,"Thank you, chair Pedersen.",69,,
324,0.97,2533.731,2542.172,"This particular slide, there is a joint--the line talking about joint efforts to reduce cost escalation drivers.",69,,
325,0.97,2542.172,2550.147,And then it talks about how Metro agrees with city support to alleviate drivers of cost escalation in Nonemergency years.,69,,
326,0.97,2550.147,2562.593,Can you talk a little bit more about the intent of this language in the new agreement?,69,,
327,0.97,2562.593,2578.475,"Probably the best way of looking at that is that we're buying heading into this new six-year period, we're going to be buying around 4% of Metro's service.",70,,
328,0.97,2578.475,2585.115,Sound transit is buying about 8% of their service.,70,,
329,0.97,2585.115,2586.75,Metro provides bus service.,70,,
330,0.97,2586.75,2593.357,"Metro provides sound transit Express, and the rest is Metro's own service.",70,,
331,0.97,2593.357,2611.642,"That fully allocated hourly cost is essentially what Metro is paying regardless of who is using the service, whether it's Metro itself or sound transit or the city is purchasing.",70,,
332,0.97,2611.642,2614.345,"The drivers, and I don't mean bus drivers.",70,,
333,0.97,2614.345,2621.452,"The drivers of the costs are, you know, a lot of it is labor costs.",70,,
334,0.97,2621.452,2622.586,Some is fare policy.,70,,
335,0.97,2622.586,2645.309,"Some of it is just the fact that we started off with a solid 25% fare box return early in the last six-year period and that inched down a little bit more, a little lower than 25% as Metro has not increased fares for a few years.",70,,
336,0.97,2645.309,2648.912,"They were scheduled, I think, to increase fares this year.",70,,
337,0.97,2648.912,2656.987,"In fact, either this year or maybe early next year, and they are not going to raise fares because of Covid.",70,,
338,0.97,2656.987,2664.928,"So you know, those are measures that increase cost to the city for the service we buy.",70,,
339,0.97,2664.928,2679.209,Metro is under tremendous pressure in its own right to alleviate costs by their Council and they are feeling that pressure from Seattle and sound transit as well.,70,,
340,0.97,2679.209,2704.034,And so Metro is really trying to sort of scrub all of those factors that go into costs and trying to figure out where they can cut costs through increased efficiencies as we return to recovery and a lot of that is reflected in the new County budget that is now in effect.,70,,
341,0.97,2704.034,2706.336,Got it.,71,,
342,0.97,2706.336,2708.806,I appreciate the clarification.,71,,
343,0.97,2708.806,2713.51,With my labor standards brain was reading that a little differently.,71,,
344,0.97,2713.51,2719.183,I think the structure of the sentence made me think we were talking about drivers.,71,,
345,0.97,2719.183,2732.262,And so I appreciate the clarification that you're talking about sort of effectively just factors that can result in escalated cost.,71,,
346,0.97,2732.262,2733.464,That's helpful.,71,,
347,0.97,2733.464,2749.113,"And in this agreement, are there any provisions in this agreement that address or deal with sort of work force, actual bus driver issues?",71,,
348,0.97,2749.113,2752.282,There really isn't.,72,,
349,0.97,2752.282,2765.529,That is completely within Metro's domain and not something that we asked for Metro to seat any authority to us nor anything that Metro would be or legally see to the city.,72,,
350,0.97,2765.529,2771.435,"Yeah, and I guess I'm not asking--thanks, I appreciate that.",73,,
351,0.97,2771.435,2779.143,I didn't mean to imply that I believe that Metro should see labor authority to us.,73,,
352,0.97,2779.143,2799.53,"I do--we are a large purchaser of services, which relies on people and their ability to fulfill the service levels we're purchasing from them inherently, such as on issues related to their labor and their work force.",73,,
353,0.97,2799.53,2818.949,"And because we are a large purchaser of services, I suppose I was wondering if there was anything in the agreement that talks about the city's expectations around--as a purchaser of those services.",73,,
354,0.97,2818.949,2854.117,"Our expectations around, you know, working conditions or just how the county is addressing concerns from their work force in the spirit of continuing to be a city that is a high road employer and wants t have partnerships and engagement with regional partners who have the same values and are willing to sort of commit to those values publicly.",73,,
355,0.97,2854.117,2866.363,"Yeah, you know, beyond some very general language that honestly isn't that specific toward labor in the recitals, there really isn't.",74,,
356,0.97,2866.363,2891.455,"Partly because the amount of service we're purchasing is such a small share of what Metro provides and I think, too, also just that we know that Metro and county government is very committed to high labor standards and working with a represented work force.",74,,
357,0.97,2891.455,2906.57,I think we felt like it wasn't something that Seattle necessarily needed to provide leverage on or anything that came up in the discussions.,74,,
358,0.97,2906.57,2927.991,"I can also say, I think there's an agreement, which governs and binds us on certain things and then there's the work that we do in partnership with Metro outside of the agreement and I think there are, as you mentioned, Council President, shared values.",75,,
359,0.97,2927.991,2944.107,"Even though those aren't articulated in the binding part of the agreement, there is certainly partnership in how they get that deliver high quality service for all of our riders.",75,,
360,0.97,2944.107,2944.474,Thank you.,76,,
361,0.97,2944.474,2945.008,Thank you.,77,,
362,0.97,2945.008,2948.679,"Councilmember Strauss, I know you have a couple more questions.",77,,
363,0.97,2948.679,2949.079,Please continue.,77,,
364,0.97,2949.079,2951.014,"Thank you, chair.",78,,
365,0.97,2951.014,2966.029,My next questions are on slide 7. and one of my question about merging needs regarding West Seattle is are we able to fund ferry service maybe you already answered this.,78,,
366,0.97,2966.029,2968.532,I will go ahead and jump in there.,79,,
367,0.97,2968.532,2990.52,We are still working to kind of finalize our planned investments for West Seattle and particularly looking at the next September service change in our coordination with Metro and then working with our Reconnecting West Seattle team within S-Dot.,79,,
368,0.97,2990.52,3017.147,"We have looked at the water taxi service that Metro operates and I think at this point, we're really looking to focus STBD investment on the fixed route service network and like I said, kind of in line with the overall principles for the program, trying to bolster the frequent service network as much as possible.",79,,
369,0.97,3017.147,3035.298,It is fairly expensive to add water taxi service and I think hat's an area where we like to continue conversations with Metro about what they might be looking at from their own perspective in terms of supporting mobility in West Seattle.,79,,
370,0.97,3035.298,3043.84,I won't necessarily advocate for more service to West Seattle unless I hear from of the West Seattle elects.,80,,
371,0.97,3043.84,3064.928,But I notice making that connection to the downtown corridor is a direct connection to the transit spine that is sound transit and many of our bus lines that I don't want to advocate for something that I see Council member Herbold.,80,,
372,0.97,3064.928,3068.398,"Councilmember, the funding proposition allows that type of spending.",81,,
373,0.97,3068.398,3074.805,"So, that is something that could be Exploed if the demand and need for it arises.",81,,
374,0.97,3074.805,3085.749,"This funding agreement is very specific to the bus transit service, so there's other work that would need to be done to figure out how and if that made sense.",81,,
375,0.97,3085.749,3088.552,"Great, which leads me to my next question.",82,,
376,0.97,3088.552,3096.493,What percentage--what is the percentage of Metro's overall budget?,82,,
377,0.97,3096.493,3106.77,"So, this level of service purchase amounts to about 3 or 4% of Metro's overall system.",83,,
378,0.97,3106.77,3114.077,"So it is less than the prior measure where in recent years, we have gotten up to as high as 10% of Metro's system.",83,,
379,0.97,3114.077,3128.525,"But I think it is really important to keep in mind that at the end of the day, Metro is still the entity providing the vast majority of transit service.",83,,
380,0.97,3128.525,3132.362,And how does that compare to the last agreement?,84,,
381,0.97,3132.362,3136.299,You said it was up as high as 10% and now it's down to 3%?,84,,
382,0.97,3136.299,3137.534,Did I hear that correctly?,84,,
383,0.97,3137.534,3160.123,It was up to about 8% in the last agreement and part of that was because we had reached sort of a funding peak that was higher than the sustainable year over year funding level in the last couple years of the previous measure.,85,,
384,0.97,3160.123,3166.363,"And so yes, our current investment is closer to 3 or 4 percent.",85,,
385,0.97,3166.363,3166.863,"Great, thank you.",86,,
386,0.97,3166.863,3174.137,"And chair, those are all my questions for slide 7.",86,,
387,0.97,3174.137,3174.804,Thank you.,87,,
388,0.97,3174.804,3177.34,"Councilmember Herbold, did you have any questions?",87,,
389,0.97,3177.34,3177.807,"Thank you, go ahead.",87,,
390,0.97,3177.807,3178.341,I do.,88,,
391,0.97,3178.341,3187.717,I want to go back to slide 7 and specifically as it relates to the emerging need for West Seattle.,88,,
392,0.97,3187.717,3190.287,A bump in the graphic there.,88,,
393,0.97,3190.287,3207.37,Just interested to understand a little bit about some of the assumption that graphic seems to convey as far as the message it is sending.,88,,
394,0.97,3207.37,3224.154,"It looks like we're only looking at, boy, a bump of, maybe a million dollars for 2021, but upwards of $5 million for 2022.",88,,
395,0.97,3224.154,3236.299,Can you talk a little bit about the assumptions underlying the allocation for those two years?,88,,
396,0.97,3236.299,3239.002,Assumptions about Ridership.,88,,
397,0.97,3239.002,3242.706,"Assumptions around social distancing, people returning to work.",88,,
398,0.97,3242.706,3264.661,"People who continue to have concerns about riding transit in a time when hopefully we will be more of us will be Vaccinated, but still some concerns about transit Ridership.",88,,
399,0.97,3264.661,3264.928,Sure.,89,,
400,0.97,3264.928,3268.031,I can speak to that.,89,,
401,0.97,3268.031,3284.214,So part of that is the somewhat lumpy nature of the service change process as we talked about a little bit with only two service changes a year and a six month planning horizon.,89,,
402,0.97,3284.214,3292.255,"You know, takes us a little while to coordinate with Metro and get service out on the roads.",89,,
403,0.97,3292.255,3299.429,"That's why for 2021, our options were really limited to the September service change, which we are working on and looking at.",89,,
404,0.97,3299.429,3306.836,It just doesn't mean that there will be that many months of service purchase in 2021.,89,,
405,0.97,3306.836,3330.093,"So we're currently looking at a bigger purchase in 2022, which is when we expect these things will sort of all align a little bit more with increasing transit Ridership post Covid as well as the bridge repair work and continued bridge closure.",89,,
406,0.97,3330.093,3352.916,"You know, there's a lot of uncertainty, I think, as you highlighted around what transit recovery will look like and exactly when we will start to see higher Ridership as well as from the public health Perfective, when Metro might be considering changes to their capacity restrictions.",89,,
407,0.97,3352.916,3392.255,"So it is difficult to exactly anticipate the amount of service that will be needed, but we're working right now with Metro to understand, you know, what their service plans are and trying to, I think, make sure that we are able to provide enough service to support a robust recovery and to give us the flexibility in case the capacity limits last maybe longer than we might have expected.",89,,
408,0.97,3392.255,3404.434,"So I think there's still a lot that is unknown, but we're doing our best to plan for pretty robust service operations in 2022.",89,,
409,0.97,3404.434,3406.102,A Followup on that.,90,,
410,0.97,3406.102,3435.265,My recollection is that the emerging needs category to address--these are goals we have for additional Metro service capacity to encourage more people to take the bus in light of the West Seattle bridge closure as people are returning to work.,90,,
411,0.97,3435.265,3437.267,And our goals are pretty significant.,90,,
412,0.97,3437.267,3446.509,I seem to remember there were trying to move about 30% more people on to transit.,90,,
413,0.97,3446.509,3451.681,"That is not only buses, it's also water taxi.",90,,
414,0.97,3451.681,3455.652,"But remind me, the allocation.",90,,
415,0.97,3527.59,3543.706,"What will likely be recommended in the upcoming service edition, recommendations, you know, prior to them coming to us in a subsequent conversation, sort of after they are all cooked.",91,,
416,0.97,3543.706,3545.108,How do we learn more?,91,,
417,0.97,3545.108,3550.113,How does the public get involved before those recommendations are being made?,91,,
418,0.97,3550.113,3560.79,"So I think maybe some of those things are things we can come back to the committee with some broader updates on the West Seattle bridge program, likely in March.",92,,
419,0.97,3560.79,3567.263,I think those are some topics we can bring forward at that point.,92,,
420,0.97,3567.263,3580.043,The service investments that we make will be made under the umbrella of this agreement and so we can get into more specifics and details there.,92,,
421,0.97,3580.043,3590.286,"I think your point about people when and how to have people ride transit in greater numbers again is right on, I recently took the bus.",92,,
422,0.97,3590.286,3608.471,"I was really impressed with both my fellow bus riders masking up and all the safety precautions that Metro and really collectively as a whole, all of the transit providers in this region put into place and the diligence with which they have done that.",92,,
423,0.97,3608.471,3612.542,It was the first time in a little while that I have taken the bus.,92,,
424,0.97,3612.542,3620.283,I felt very comfortable and safe in doing so.,92,,
425,0.97,3620.283,3635.498,But recognize there's a capacity constraint in how to achieve the shift that we will need to have from West Seattle to have sustainable transportation back and forth.,92,,
426,0.97,3635.498,3696.893,"One thing I could add about your question about our proposals for September and future service changes is we do have created in the wake of the first prop one, we do have a transit advisory board and we meet with them monthly and do run our service change proposal by them in advance and at the same time, at least through the last STBD measure, I assume this will continue, we met on a monthly basis with Council staff, just to brief them on the same kind of information we're providing to the transit advisory board and so that's certainly one way that that information can come to you in advance of us finalizing the service purchase decisions.",93,,
427,0.97,3696.893,3699.829,I wanted to answer a question if I could.,94,,
428,0.97,3699.829,3700.763,Of course.,95,,
429,0.97,3700.763,3701.23,Thank you.,96,,
430,0.97,3701.23,3704.233,I'm just a little bit confused.,96,,
431,0.97,3704.233,3708.604,I may have missed an explanation here.,96,,
432,0.97,3708.604,3730.993,"When I asked the question about the modest bump for 2021 for emerging needs for West Seattle as compared to 2022, I felt what I heard was the reason because there aren't going to be service additions until September.",96,,
433,0.97,3730.993,3734.931,But I thought that we do service additions in March and September.,96,,
434,0.97,3734.931,3742.071,"So, what did I Miss?",96,,
435,0.97,3742.071,3743.506,I'm sorry.,96,,
436,0.97,3743.506,3744.373,"Go ahead, Briana.",97,,
437,0.97,3744.373,3745.742,That's absolutely correct.,98,,
438,0.97,3745.742,3751.447,There will be a service change this March.,98,,
439,0.97,3751.447,3758.721,I think the issue is really kind of information on the slide after this one.,98,,
440,0.97,3758.721,3781.677,"I think around the service planning process, which requires quite a bit of lead time and because of a couple of different things that we're pretty unique to this year, including the November election to determine whether there would be continued STBD funding as well as uncertainty around I976.",98,,
441,0.97,3781.677,3799.762,We weren't really in a position when we were beginning planning for this March service change to have Metro run full steam ahead with a major service add in West Seattle.,98,,
442,0.97,3799.762,3808.571,So we will still certainly be making some service investments and Tryng to maintain some of the investments that we already have had in West Seattle.,98,,
443,0.97,3808.571,3823.286,It is just mostly that we aren't able to shift a lot of new resources over in time for this March service change.,98,,
444,0.97,3823.286,3848.744,"The bar on that same slide, for transit service that goes from zero to $20 million, represents the new transit service under the transportation benefit district.",99,,
445,0.97,3848.744,3851.214,Is that correct?,99,,
446,0.97,3851.214,3858.821,So you are adding service for the rest of the city under the transportation benefit --,99,,
447,0.97,3858.821,3863.993,"Sorry, much of that is service that was being purchased under the old measure.",100,,
448,0.97,3863.993,3864.26,Okay.,101,,
449,0.97,3864.26,3867.597,A lot of that is continuation of service.,102,,
450,0.97,3867.597,3872.768,"We don't have as much money as we did have, we are seeing reductions in general.",102,,
451,0.97,3872.768,3873.436,So --,103,,
452,0.97,3873.436,3876.906,"Some of that does serve West Seattle, I want to be clear.",104,,
453,0.97,3876.906,3879.742,That is sustaining the level of service.,104,,
454,0.97,3879.742,3897.627,"And part of the reason why the bar is lower than the others is a reminder, the STBD will collect 3/4 of a year of revenue during the first year during 2021, because the sales tax won't go into effect until April 1.",104,,
455,0.97,3897.627,3898.828,Okay.,105,,
456,0.97,3898.828,3899.662,"All right, thank you.",105,,
457,0.97,3899.662,3904.066,"Thank you, colleagues for all the questions about the transit service agreement.",106,,
458,0.97,3904.066,3910.606,I want to take a step back and thank the voters for approving the funding and making this possible.,106,,
