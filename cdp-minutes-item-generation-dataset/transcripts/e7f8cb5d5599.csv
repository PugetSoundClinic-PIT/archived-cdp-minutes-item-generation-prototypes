266,0.97,1993.057,2077.642,"You know, a lot has been said about this over the last couple of weeks as we have discussed this, and the news, as a community, not just as a city government, that we make sure we are aggressively pursuing every possible resource to make an impact on the really, really difficult issue that all of us see on a daily basis of chronic homelessness in our community, knowing that there are lots of things we can be pursuing with this Federal Reimbursable resource to mitigate the impact of this emergency, get people Hygienic place with four walls and a door that locks where they can live with dignity and be protected from the very real and rampant pandemic, we know from some of the conversations this morning, and we know from our brief meeting last week, despite calls for optimism, there is still a rampant virus out there that folks experiencing homelessness are more vulnerable to without having a lots of places that we take for granted to be able to shelter in place and a safe and Hygienic way from the unique challenges of the pandemic.",106,,
267,0.97,2077.642,2095.927,"This resource specifically will help the city to address that, to provide the kind of Non- Congregant shelter that is essential for people who are 65 and older, people with Comorbidities, people with enhanced vulnerability to the disaster and can take advantage of.",106,,
268,0.97,2095.927,2103.801,"I want to note, this is a resource that is on top of other resources this Council has appropriated and putting forward to provide more Non- Congregant shelter.",106,,
269,0.97,2103.801,2137.768,"It is additive to the 300 hotel rooms about the Council provided funding for last fall, it is additive to the 120 additional tiny houses the Council provided, as well as the 125 enhanced shelter spaces, those 545 total aggregate spaces, still in the process of setting up in collaboration with the Council, and we should get a pretty big update on all of those assets in the April meeting of the Council.",106,,
270,0.97,2137.768,2164.729,"But, in the meantime, we can be leaning in with this additional resource to take advantage of the generous offer from FEMA to 100% reimburse for certain expenses that need criteria, that we have spent a lot of time drilling down the specifics of in this legislation.",106,,
271,0.97,2164.729,2186.384,"One last thing I do want to say on this, just to make sure we don't forget, I know Council President had indicated an interest in being added as cosponsor, want to make sure we do that before the passage, I don't know that this is the time to signify his prime sponsor that that is absolutely very warranted, given that key leadership role Council President played in bringing us together.",106,,

279,0.97,2245.409,2342.907,"I am not seeing any more comments on this, I am really excited to be able to vote in favor of this particular counsel bill, and I think it makes a lot of sense based on what the prime sponsor and chairman Mosqueda just mentioned, and glad we were able to find some much-needed clarity on the policy position related to this bill from the Federal level that really allowed us to move this particular legislation forward, of course, there is no 100% guarantee of 100% reimbursement, but I think any opportunity we can to get reimbursement, even if it is partial, is critically important to continue to protect those who cannot shelter in place from the devastating deadly impacts of Covid-19, we know it is going to take us a while to catch up to the demand, and the need, as it relates to vaccination, and we also know when we are talking about hard to reach community members like those who do not currently have housing or are in sheltered, it is going to be even more challenging to deploy Vaccinations into the community, it is going to take us a little bit longer, because of the transit nation of the population, the strategy and other strategies that allow us to focus on Non-Congregant shelter for those individuals who will continue to be at a significant risk to Covid-19 is going to be critically important for the city moving forward.",109,,
280,0.97,2342.907,2347.611,Appreciate the good sense here in advancing this bill.,109,,
