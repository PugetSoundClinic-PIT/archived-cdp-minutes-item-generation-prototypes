36,0.97,222.288,231.898,So I will start with Lachesia farmer who will be followed by Anna Powell.,6,,
37,0.97,231.898,233.366,Good afternoon.,7,,
38,0.97,233.366,235.201,I am Lachesia farmer with working Washington.,7,,
39,0.97,235.201,240.139,I wanted to speak on two amendments we are Agains.,7,,
40,0.97,240.139,247.814,"First, we reject allowing companies to calculate minimum payment on a paid period basis rather than on a per offer basis.",7,,
41,0.97,247.814,252.585,Companies are seeking this because it would result in a significant pay cut.,7,,
42,0.97,252.585,260.76,It would lower the pay and undermine protection and has no basis in how contractors are otherwise paid.,7,,
43,0.97,260.76,266.933,"If implemented, this change would undermine Inintent of the policy.",7,,
44,0.97,266.933,277.877,Seattle's fair share minimum payment for TNC drivers is applied to each offer as is the minimum agreement paid by Uber and Lyft in the House bill 2076.,7,,
45,0.97,277.877,287.654,Every policy not by the company calculates on a per offer basis because a weekly calculation is a pay cut in disguise.,7,,
46,0.97,287.654,290.256,We reject the market place companies.,7,,
47,0.97,290.256,295.361,"Removing network companies would undermine the purpose of this ordinance, leaving thousands of workers without protection.",7,,
48,0.97,295.361,308.074,The market place definition has not been identified to identify a type of company where labor standards are not necessary but to define a type of company that needs specific language to accommodate for how workers and customers interact.,7,,
49,0.97,308.074,319.652,Using this definition as a basis to exclude workers could have disasterous impact and Incentvise bad actors to take advantage of a loop hole.,7,,
50,0.97,319.652,324.791,Rover and tax Rev t have engaged in the PAYOUT policy for almost a year.,7,,
51,0.97,324.791,335.468,Stake holders have worked to identify policy solutions which accommodate changing business Mauldles and also fulfilling the intention of providing basic labor standards.,7,,
52,0.97,335.468,342.442,The pay policy has been described as a broad standard for gig workers.,7,,
53,0.97,342.442,347.28,Whee urge you to reject the amendments and pass the legislation as intended.,7,,
54,0.97,347.28,347.613,Thank you.,7,,
55,0.97,347.613,348.414,Thank you.,8,,
56,0.97,348.414,350.383,The next Speaker is Anna Powell.,8,,
57,0.97,350.383,356.389,Anna will be followed by Shelby Hanson.,8,,
58,0.97,356.389,360.193,"Hi, my name is Anna Powell.",9,,
59,0.97,360.193,366.799,I'm the manager of government relations in the Northwest for door dash.,9,,
60,0.97,366.799,368.668,We are opposed the PAYOUT introduced.,9,,
61,0.97,368.668,375.375,The Council should pause the study and fully understand the impact to the community before it is passed.,9,,
62,0.97,375.375,384.317,"As a sitting Council considering legislation, it may cut $32 million in aggregate earners for Dashers due to declines in volume.",9,,
63,0.97,384.317,386.352,It is important to separate myth from fact.,9,,
64,0.97,386.352,390.156,You may have heard the phrase Subminimum wage.,9,,
65,0.97,390.156,397.597,The fact that it Dashers in Seattle earn on average $28 per hour while on delivery.,9,,
66,0.97,397.597,404.704,The average Dasher works less than 10 hours a week and does not rely on the platform as their only source of income.,9,,
67,0.97,404.704,409.509,But instead to supplement full-time work or to achieve financial goals.,9,,
68,0.97,409.509,424.724,"In fact, we know that 36% of Dashers in Washington have dashed to avoid needing to apply for government benefits and 68% of Dashers have dashed to make up for lost income or reduced hours of work.",9,,
69,0.97,424.724,432.131,"Finally, as you may hear in the public hearing, the PAYOUTS are designed with industry input.",9,,
70,0.97,432.131,441.34,"The fact is while we appreciate the ongoing conversations with stake holders, we feel that our input has not properly been considered or included in the legislation.",9,,
71,0.97,441.34,447.246,We do not support the pay up proposal.,9,,
72,0.97,447.246,449.382,Thank you for your time.,9,,
73,0.97,449.382,451.651,Next Speaker is Shelby Hanson.,10,,
74,0.97,451.651,457.19,Shelby will be followed by Toby Cretten.,10,,
75,0.97,457.19,457.423,Shelby?,10,,
76,0.97,457.423,463.729,"I'm Shelby, a gig worker and a member of the PS campaign.",11,,
77,0.97,463.729,473.439,Rover has also encouraged their workers to maintain a low pay threshold in order to undercut other Rover workers.,11,,
78,0.97,473.439,482.748,The base pay is not to sustain a livable wage let alone to live without some sort of debt.,11,,
79,0.97,482.748,492.391,Rover takes 20% of every job I do.,11,,
80,0.97,492.391,500.032,Rover meets over $1.5 million at any given time.,11,,
81,0.97,500.032,502.568,This isn't a way to live.,11,,
82,0.97,502.568,511.978,Forcing people to accept low wages and forces them into poverty.,11,,
83,0.97,511.978,513.446,Poverty affects us all.,11,,
84,0.97,513.446,516.048,Rover is in our own backyard.,11,,
85,0.97,516.048,522.021,"As a Seattle company, you would have thought they would have treated us better.",11,,
86,0.97,522.021,530.396,We need the city of Seattle Council to pass the pay up campaign now to help us.,11,,
87,0.97,530.396,536.402,"Thank you, very much for listening to me speak.",11,,
88,0.97,536.402,539.839,"Thank you, Shelby.",12,,
89,0.97,539.839,548.314,Our next Speaker is Toby Cretten followed by Tiffany Albees.,12,,
90,0.97,548.314,550.082,Good afternoon Councilmembers.,13,,
91,0.97,550.082,559.225,I'm here on behalf of Seattle restaurants Uninited which represents over 240 small and independent restaurants in Seattle.,13,,
92,0.97,559.225,562.862,We are strongly in support of PAYOUT.,13,,
93,0.97,562.862,564.297,We urge you to advance legislation.,13,,
94,0.97,564.297,571.203,Our members are business owners who want to see our economy reflect the community hospitality.,13,,
95,0.97,571.203,577.41,"We believe when the most marginalized in the community is cared for, it's good for the business, the customers, and the city.",13,,
96,0.97,577.41,585.017,"Over the past few years, I think everyone is aware, delivery Apps have become increasingly large part of the restaurant business.",13,,
97,0.97,585.017,592.191,More and more of our members depend on deliveries to keep us moving during tough times and serve customers where they are.,13,,
98,0.97,592.191,602.168,The Apps present their own challenges with restaurants charging large commissions and sometimes lifting restaurants without permission.,13,,
99,0.97,602.168,605.338,The permission Kap was removed and required to get permission.,13,,
100,0.97,605.338,609.475,That was great to rebound the power differential.,13,,
101,0.97,609.475,613.779,The gig workers need support too.,13,,
102,0.97,613.779,622.221,We believe the worker should be paid enough for their families.,13,,
103,0.97,622.221,624.09,It is good economics.,13,,
104,0.97,624.09,627.693,We can't recover from Covid without thriving restaurants in our city.,13,,
105,0.97,627.693,636.769,"That means making sure everyone working in our industry is paid enough to support themselves, whether they are bringing dinner to your table or front door.",13,,
106,0.97,636.769,642.775,We hope this policy is a priority for action.,13,,
107,0.97,642.775,643.876,Now is the time.,13,,
108,0.97,643.876,645.077,Thank you.,13,,
109,0.97,645.077,647.313,Thank you.,14,,
110,0.97,647.313,650.616,"Our next Speaker, Tiffany Albeads is not showing as present.",14,,
111,0.97,650.616,652.351,We will come back as that changes.,14,,
112,0.97,652.351,659.925,"We will go to Carmen Figgera, followed by Justin higher.",14,,
113,0.97,659.925,660.159,Carmen?,14,,
114,0.97,660.159,666.866,"Hello, I'm Carmen Figgero with the pay up campaign.",15,,
115,0.97,666.866,676.142,The industry executives have paid millions in dollars off of my labor and have no intentions in investing me or any of their workers.,15,,
116,0.97,676.142,684.55,The lobbyist on the calls will make outlandish claims to justify paying workers some minimum wages.,15,,
117,0.97,684.55,691.39,They will derail equity conversations with Ridilous debates and demands to delay equity with useless studies.,15,,
118,0.97,691.39,699.799,"The talking points are created by App lawyers, designed to pit small businesses against gig workers of color.",15,,
119,0.97,699.799,706.105,Expanding pay models for gig workers makes social economic equality a reality and not just a campaign slogan.,15,,
120,0.97,706.105,716.949,"Common sense and not the study is all that is needed to understand that when workers get paid more, they spend more in the community.",15,,
121,0.97,716.949,732.231,"The Council's time would better be--better be studying what hurts small businesses is App executives transferring more and more profits to themselves, siphoning away cash Fromtuants.",15,,
122,0.97,732.231,741.207,"For those who find themselves at the top of the financial pyramid, it costs nothing to provide equity for those holding them up from below.",15,,
123,0.97,741.207,745.911,All the pay out policy will do is elevate the marginalized.,15,,
124,0.97,745.911,749.215,I'm trusting lawmakers to pass this for gig workers.,15,,
125,0.97,749.215,752.418,We are not disposable and should not be exploited.,15,,
126,0.97,752.418,754.12,Thank you for your support.,15,,
127,0.97,754.12,755.454,Thank you.,16,,
128,0.97,755.454,759.692,Our next Speaker is Justin higher.,16,,
129,0.97,759.692,764.029,Justin will be followed by Mandolin Noir.,16,,
130,0.97,764.029,768.901,"Good afternoon, I'm the director of government affairs for the platform shift.",17,,
131,0.97,768.901,777.91,Thank you for providing me with with the opportunity to respectfully offer concerns.,17,,
132,0.97,777.91,787.987,The ordinance before you creates the potential for additional barriers to entry for these earners and they drive down the flexible opportunities available to them.,17,,
133,0.97,787.987,794.36,Our effort based approach allows for shoppers to work as little and as much as they want in a way that works for their needs.,17,,
134,0.97,794.36,798.664,75% of our shoppers choose to work less than 10 hours a week.,17,,
135,0.97,798.664,807.706,"Last year, shift shoppers made on average between 25 to 35 an hour when factoring offer pay, bonuses and tips.",17,,
136,0.97,807.706,813.479,Delivery App based work involves many nuances factors to ensure the system works for our customers and shoppers.,17,,
137,0.97,813.479,822.922,There have been no attempts to study Ineconomic impact of this measure which risks economic uncertainty and risks the flexible work opportunity shoppers in Seattle.,17,,
138,0.97,822.922,828.46,Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to express concerns with the ordinance.,17,,
139,0.97,828.46,832.464,Please reach out with any concern you have.,17,,
140,0.97,832.464,833.465,Thank you.,18,,
141,0.97,833.465,837.236,Our next Speaker Mandolin Noir is showing not present.,18,,
142,0.97,837.236,840.372,We will come back if that changes.,18,,
143,0.97,840.372,845.377,We move to Bryan Rodriguez followed by Joel Shapiro.,18,,
144,0.97,845.377,848.347,"Hi, my main is Brian Rodriguez.",19,,
145,0.97,848.347,849.448,I'm a Dasher based in Seattle.,19,,
146,0.97,849.448,855.487,I'm working to save enough to go back to school without having to depend on my parents and family.,19,,
147,0.97,855.487,860.226,We are all going through a hard time with gas prices and inflation.,19,,
148,0.97,860.226,865.865,Dash has made it possible to remain financially free and make it to class on time.,19,,
149,0.97,865.865,868.634,It has made time easier and I want it to stay that way.,19,,
150,0.97,868.634,872.671,I stand before you today because I worry that the current proposal is problematic.,19,,
151,0.97,872.671,881.747,"If we are trying to help Dashers, I want to know that our legislatures have done everything necessary to make sure it helps us and not hurts us.",19,,
152,0.97,881.747,889.221,I asked the city Council to take more time to study PAYOUT to understand the consequences of the proposal before passing it.,19,,
153,0.97,889.221,890.756,Thank you so much.,19,,
154,0.97,890.756,892.157,Thank you.,20,,
155,0.97,892.157,900.266,"The next Speaker is Joel Shapiro, followed by Alison Ford.",20,,
156,0.97,900.266,900.466,Joel?,20,,
157,0.97,900.466,904.003,"Hi, my name is Joel Shapiro.",21,,
158,0.97,904.003,910.242,I'm one of the Cofounders of Donefly and also the labor standards in Seattle.,21,,
159,0.97,910.242,915.447,It is no secret that the gig economy is broken.,21,,
160,0.97,915.447,919.618,"Low pay, low flexibility and no opportunities for people to take control of the work.",21,,
161,0.97,919.618,926.792,We need new business models to fix it and new policies to ensure protections.,21,,
162,0.97,926.792,931.931,My Cofounders started Doneply and it is why I support the pay out.,21,,
163,0.97,931.931,938.37,Technology has the potential to deliver flexibility along with meaningful transparency and fair pay.,21,,
164,0.97,938.37,943.108,That's not what workers experience on Apps like Instacart and door dash.,21,,
165,0.97,943.108,946.745,Technology and the gig economy is being used for the opposite.,21,,
166,0.97,946.745,957.089,"Instead of transparent and fair pay, pay rates are determined by constantly changing Algorithms designed with what the company can get away with.",21,,
167,0.97,957.089,965.397,"Instead of deciding what jobs are worth taking, workers are pitted to immediately accept or lose offers.",21,,
168,0.97,965.397,970.369,Workers cover their own expenses and hoping for tips to make any money.,21,,
169,0.97,970.369,977.743,I have heard from workers for years as we have been building in Seattle.,21,,
170,0.97,977.743,980.479,We are creating a true model for workers.,21,,
171,0.97,980.479,984.583,Our team is dedicated to making the ownership model succeed but it is not enough.,21,,
172,0.97,984.583,986.819,There will always be other companies in the market.,21,,
173,0.97,986.819,993.993,"If they are not guided by the mission to provide workers with proper pay and tools of transparency, workers will pay the price.",21,,
174,0.97,993.993,998.23,That's what we have seen over the past few years.,21,,
175,0.97,998.23,1007.039,"The gig economy has the ability to provide access that they need but it has a ton of down sides, especially when it is out of bounds like it is now.",21,,
176,0.97,1007.039,1017.583,Businesses like Dumpling are helping to provide meaningful opportunities to workers but we need policies like pay out to move forward when companies fail to step up.,21,,
177,0.97,1017.583,1018.384,Thank you.,21,,
178,0.97,1018.384,1019.184,Thank you.,22,,
179,0.97,1019.184,1028.293,"The next Speaker is Alison Ford, followed by Cideign bane.",22,,

184,0.97,1037.436,1050.983,"As we have testified in the past, Uber is supportive of an earning Standard and WELCOMES the opportunity to partner with the city Council and all stake holders to develop a legislative solution.",23,,
185,0.97,1050.983,1063.395,"However, this current bill needs significant amendments to address what will certainly be widespread unintended consequences Impacting small businesses and the work opportunities of platform drivers.",23,,
186,0.97,1063.395,1077.476,Among our many concerns are the overall high costs of the earning standard formula and lack of research to truly measure what impact this will have on the community and the economy.,23,,
187,0.97,1077.476,1084.316,"This bill is also lacking basic guard rails to protect against potential fraud, the well known problem throughout the industry.",23,,

204,0.97,1154.353,1166.064,"So I'm just here today to testify that in this country, the gap between the rich and the poor is getting wider and wider and the middle class is diminishing.",29,,
205,0.97,1166.064,1179.945,"This is because of the labor force with no regulations especially when it comes to labor jobs, the ones governed by an employer as well as the big companies with independent contractors.",29,,
206,0.97,1179.945,1191.723,The city as well as other governments and organizations should have a strong policy regarding this kind of rule.,29,,
207,0.97,1191.723,1199.431,The big or gig companies they just make millions of dollars while each individual contractors make less than minimum wage.,29,,
208,0.97,1199.431,1215.38,"In order to keep up with the living standard of the day to day, what we see right now, people can't afford to live because minimum wage doesn't make sense.",29,,
209,0.97,1215.38,1216.515,People have to make a living.,29,,
210,0.97,1216.515,1238.003,"So in order to make a living income, governments have to have as well as independent contractors and gig workers have to have access and also the government has to put a cap on the margins of these companies.",29,,
211,0.97,1238.003,1246.478,Because they need to make a living and also to have a stable economy for the country.,29,,
212,0.97,1246.478,1246.878,Thank you.,29,,
213,0.97,1246.878,1248.747,Thank you.,30,,

218,0.97,1271.236,1276.541,"The people working for business, we are the ones doing.",31,,
219,0.97,1276.541,1288.987,"We are the ones shopping, taking food for customers, driving around two or three times because we can't find parking lots.",31,,
220,0.97,1288.987,1291.39,"That time and gas, they are not paying for that.",31,,
221,0.97,1291.39,1298.03,It has to come out of our pocket.,31,,
222,0.97,1298.03,1306.772,We are not earning what they claim we are earning.,31,,
223,0.97,1306.772,1307.272,We need this policy now.,31,,
224,0.97,1307.272,1313.078,Thank you so much.,31,,
225,0.97,1313.078,1314.012,Thank you.,32,,
226,0.97,1314.012,1319.785,"Our next Speaker is Michelle Thomas, followed by way LIN.",32,,
227,0.97,1319.785,1320.052,Michelle?,32,,
228,0.97,1320.052,1332.998,I'm with the Washington low income housing alliance to support pay up to eliminate Subminimum pay for gig workers in Seattle and thank you for your Loadership in the policy.,33,,
229,0.97,1332.998,1339.171,There is a link between wages and our State and city's affordable housing crisis.,33,,
230,0.97,1339.171,1344.409,People cannot afford the sky high rent in Seattle in the greater region.,33,,
231,0.97,1344.409,1351.583,Eviction for nonpayment of rent is the top reason people lose their homes and is the leading cause of homelessness.,33,,
232,0.97,1351.583,1363.729,We are working at the state and regional level to help the crisis but it will not be solved if workers make too little to pay their rent and meet basic needs.,33,,
233,0.97,1363.729,1372.537,I know you feel urgency to end the homeless crisis and this is why we urge you to support pay up.,33,,
234,0.97,1372.537,1378.543,There was an article about a worker fearing the end of the Eviction moratorium.,33,,
235,0.97,1378.543,1382.447,They were trying to get the money to stay housed.,33,,
236,0.97,1382.447,1384.082,They are a gig worker.,33,,
237,0.97,1384.082,1385.817,Their story is not unique.,33,,
238,0.97,1385.817,1392.557,Gig workers were facing the impossible situation of uncertain income and pay that is too low to meet the housing costs.,33,,
239,0.97,1392.557,1397.229,"Everyone needs and deserves a safe, healthy and affordable home.",33,,
240,0.97,1397.229,1402.501,Every worker needs and deserves the security of a minimum wage for the work.,33,,
241,0.97,1402.501,1412.711,I urge you to support pay up and not have loop holes to evade protection.,33,,
242,0.97,1412.711,1415.58,Thank you for your work on the policy.,33,,
243,0.97,1415.58,1416.381,Thank you.,34,,
244,0.97,1416.381,1428.226,Our next Speaker is way Linfollowed by Mike Sutello.,34,,
245,0.97,1428.226,1428.727,Greetings.,35,,
246,0.97,1428.727,1432.831,I work for gig worker since 2020.,35,,
247,0.97,1432.831,1446.311,"I really need to--at the beginning of the year, it has been continually changing the message without reason and had a huge impact on drivers income.",35,,
248,0.97,1446.311,1452.35,They took away guaranteed pay and cut our earnings tremendously without a minimum pay for the drivers.,35,,
249,0.97,1452.35,1457.989,"Also with the new system they are using right now, only sending out one bag at a time.",35,,
250,0.97,1457.989,1467.065,So most the driver has increased their miles and gas costs on the cars but not earned.,35,,
251,0.97,1467.065,1473.839,They have increased the fee for customer.,35,,
252,0.97,1473.839,1481.546,But drivers are still earning less and less on the orders because we mostly run out with one bag and one route trip.,35,,
253,0.97,1481.546,1487.285,"When we are working with the cart, we have to go to the warehouse and wait for our turn.",35,,
254,0.97,1487.285,1489.187,There is a line of drivers waiting.,35,,
255,0.97,1489.187,1492.19,Sometimes it takes more than 90 minutes to wait for one order.,35,,
256,0.97,1492.19,1496.895,"In those time, we are not covered but at our own risk.",35,,
257,0.97,1496.895,1504.436,There are different times of the day that can affect the time.,35,,
258,0.97,1504.436,1513.545,"Each single trip, all round trips, really help the drivers.",35,,
259,0.97,1513.545,1514.479,Drivers are Hard-Working people.,35,,
260,0.97,1514.479,1515.28,We risk our safety.,35,,
261,0.97,1515.28,1522.454,Most of us are doing double overtime during the pandemic.,35,,
262,0.97,1522.454,1533.064,I have not received properly because the big corporations manipulate drivers so easy and control our income to make their business going well.,35,,
263,0.97,1533.064,1546.344,"All we want is fair pay to make sure we can survive in the city to live with inflation and other impacts to us, to have a for our family and Seattle.",35,,
264,0.97,1546.344,1547.913,Thank you for your time.,35,,
265,0.97,1547.913,1549.214,Thank you.,36,,
266,0.97,1549.214,1554.019,Our next Speaker is Mike Sutello.,36,,
267,0.97,1554.019,1564.362,Mike will be followed by Asell Baler.,36,,
268,0.97,1564.362,1564.763,"Mike, hit Star 6?",36,,
269,0.97,1564.763,1570.568,I don't know if you can hear me.,36,,
270,0.97,1570.568,1576.207,We need you to hit Star 6.,36,,
271,0.97,1576.207,1583.248,We almost had you.,36,,
272,0.97,1583.248,1585.283,Try again.,36,,
273,0.97,1585.283,1594.259,"Here we go, I apologize I'm chairman of the chambers of Washington.",37,,
274,0.97,1594.259,1598.797,"On behalf of the chambers, we give unified voice to many communities in the region.",37,,
275,0.97,1598.797,1604.135,We have concerns that are related to the pay up proposal.,37,,
276,0.97,1604.135,1607.872,Just a couple of them are concerned on flexibility.,37,,
277,0.97,1607.872,1610.809,A lot of our members have two jobs.,37,,
278,0.97,1610.809,1613.311,They do driving after running their businesses.,37,,
279,0.97,1613.311,1629.227,They have to have flexibility in order to pick up the kids and do all of the things associated with running a family a minimum pay increase as written would hurt small businesses.,37,,
280,0.97,1629.227,1630.729,There is no doubt about it.,37,,
281,0.97,1630.729,1632.163,It would hurt small businesses.,37,,
282,0.97,1632.163,1634.799,"And right now, we don't need that.",37,,
283,0.97,1634.799,1640.105,The negative impact of something like this at a time when we are dealing with the pandemic ending.,37,,
284,0.97,1640.105,1649.28,We have safety issues to where our customers are not--it is almost impossible to find parking spots as the one person said earlier.,37,,
285,0.97,1649.28,1653.151,They are also afraid of getting Burglarized.,37,,
286,0.97,1653.151,1658.79,Seattle is number one in the country for being Burglarized.,37,,
287,0.97,1658.79,1660.225,And also $25 for parking.,37,,
288,0.97,1660.225,1662.694,This is very untimely for small business.,37,,
289,0.97,1662.694,1664.796,We just don't need this right now.,37,,
290,0.97,1664.796,1670.769,We want to work with the Council on coming up with something that is more plausible.,37,,
291,0.97,1670.769,1677.876,But we were never asked what our 2600 members represented.,37,,
292,0.97,1677.876,1686.885,"So we at this point stand opposed to this type of proposal and would like to work with the Council in the future, thank you.",37,,
293,0.97,1686.885,1696.394,Our next Speaker is Michelle Ballser followed by Jacqueline Morris.,38,,
294,0.97,1696.394,1705.336,"Michelle, can you hit Star 6, Mroez?",38,,
295,0.97,1705.336,1705.603,Hello?,39,,
296,0.97,1705.603,1705.904,Perfect.,40,,
297,0.97,1705.904,1709.507,So I'm Michelle and I'm full-time with Instacart.,40,,
298,0.97,1709.507,1710.542,It is my only gig.,40,,
299,0.97,1710.542,1721.72,I want to say thanks to everyone on the Council for kind of spending the last year with me and my concerns.,40,,
300,0.97,1721.72,1722.454,And supporting us.,40,,
301,0.97,1722.454,1726.424,Gig companies have a long history of exploiting their workers.,40,,
302,0.97,1726.424,1744.742,"They use the independent contractor labor to avoid paying taxes, benefits, wages, while we the drivers are the face of the company who impact their revenue and customer satisfaction.",40,,
303,0.97,1744.742,1748.813,We carry the burden of expenses and we don't have a role in our work.,40,,
304,0.97,1748.813,1752.851,They say flexible but we don't get to determine what work we receive.,40,,
305,0.97,1752.851,1754.953,We are pitted against each other.,40,,
306,0.97,1754.953,1760.291,"And the Algorithms determine where we shop, when we shop, how we shop.",40,,
307,0.97,1760.291,1763.928,We really don't have any control.,40,,
308,0.97,1763.928,1767.132,I know why respective concerns are with the impact of what this could be.,40,,
309,0.97,1767.132,1773.638,We and you need to consider the full impact on everyone and not just the small business sector.,40,,
310,0.97,1773.638,1778.243,"An investment in workers means an investment in the local infrastructure, businesses, families.",40,,
311,0.97,1778.243,1782.08,None of these companies have investment in the city or the people in it.,40,,
312,0.97,1782.08,1785.15,These Apps are third party.,40,,
313,0.97,1785.15,1787.118,They are middle man.,40,,
314,0.97,1787.118,1794.459,They are targeting the businesses they quote support and it impacts the Profitses.,40,,
315,0.97,1794.459,1797.395,It will not harm customers or businesses.,40,,
316,0.97,1797.395,1798.496,They will both continue.,40,,
317,0.97,1798.496,1800.632,Local businesses will go on.,40,,
318,0.97,1800.632,1802.467,Workers will continue to work.,40,,
319,0.97,1802.467,1807.071,It will just be a different umbrella.,40,,
320,0.97,1807.071,1811.576,"And also, the alternate pay method that they are coming up with is not going to work.",40,,
321,0.97,1811.576,1814.646,There has been issues with transparency and changes were made.,40,,
322,0.97,1814.646,1819.584,"Slowly, I watched in the last year or two the Transparencies go away.",40,,
323,0.97,1819.584,1828.793,This allows the workers to track their earnings and know that they are getting paid honestly.,40,,
324,0.97,1828.793,1829.494,That's what we need.,40,,
325,0.97,1829.494,1838.469,"Thank you, our next Speaker is Jacqueline Morris, followed by Jack Sorensen.",41,,
326,0.97,1838.469,1841.673,"Good afternoon, Councilmember and Committee.",42,,
327,0.97,1841.673,1843.308,I'm the engagement Corrector for drive forward.,42,,
328,0.97,1843.308,1850.848,I have been a part of the stake holder meetings from the beginning.,42,,
329,0.97,1850.848,1854.452,I thank Councilmember Herbold and the office for making us a part of this.,42,,
330,0.97,1854.452,1872.904,"This message is for all of the gig workers who are listening, our members I have been speaking to who is being pitted against drive forward and the company and pay up, being pitted against each other.",42,,
331,0.97,1872.904,1877.175,I'm here to say we are pretty much on the same page.,42,,
332,0.97,1877.175,1884.816,"We all agree, and every stake holder that has been a part of the meeting agrees that a standard needs to be created.",42,,
333,0.97,1884.816,1886.851,We are hopeful for a solution.,42,,
334,0.97,1886.851,1894.259,But that is why we need a study I know there is a lot of emotion tied to the issue.,42,,
335,0.97,1894.259,1900.164,I feel it personally and I hear it on a daily basis for my members.,42,,
336,0.97,1900.164,1905.67,"But the fact is, the laws are very serious business.",42,,
337,0.97,1905.67,1915.48,They should be created with emotion but created and implemented with data.,42,,
338,0.97,1915.48,1923.988,Tomake sure we are not unintentionally creating a worse scenario or the gig workers.,42,,
339,0.97,1923.988,1937.835,Every stake holder agrees that delivery workers who need attention and it is also why we call for delivery workers to be focused on in this legislation.,42,,
340,0.97,1937.835,1941.572,Thank you for your time and I look forward to our continued conversation.,42,,
341,0.97,1941.572,1942.874,Thank you so much.,43,,
342,0.97,1942.874,1948.746,I want to recognize that Council member Nelson has joined us.,43,,
343,0.97,1948.746,1959.891,"Moving onto the next Speaker, we have Jack Sorensen, followed by Elaine Zon.",43,,
344,0.97,1959.891,1962.393,Good afternoon.,44,,
345,0.97,1962.393,1968.599,My name is Jack Sorensen on behalf of ventures for pay up legislation.,44,,
346,0.97,1968.599,1974.372,The usual claims about stronger wages hurting business are inaccurate.,44,,
347,0.97,1974.372,1979.177,The last couple of years have been a boom time for gig companies.,44,,
348,0.97,1979.177,1983.114,They are raking in record profits while paying Subminimum wages.,44,,
349,0.97,1983.114,1985.917,We would not allow any other employer in the city to get away with this.,44,,
350,0.97,1985.917,1994.025,But we have a system that allows gig companies to exploit people in the city to maximize the profits.,44,,
351,0.97,1994.025,2005.837,"Not only is this morally reprehensible, it is terrible for the city's economy and terrible for the very small businesses like restaurants that these gig companies and representatives claim to support.",44,,

353,0.97,2017.982,2029.127,"Gig companies like door dash, Instacart, Uber, and others are effectively siphoning money out of Seattle's economy and delivering it to their Ceo's and share holders.",44,,
354,0.97,2029.127,2034.232,It is at the expense of workers and families as well as small businesses in the city.,44,,
355,0.97,2034.232,2038.403,Passing pay up won't just benefit workers.,44,,
356,0.97,2038.403,2041.205,It will benefit Seattle's economy and small businesses.,44,,

359,0.97,2050.214,2051.582,It's a Win-Win.,44,,
360,0.97,2051.582,2062.593,Seattle can choose to be a national leader by passing pay up policies and showing that the right thing to do is also the smart thing to do for our economy.,44,,

369,0.97,2098.629,2101.766,We are in opposition to this pay up proposal.,48,,
370,0.97,2101.766,2118.082,We think it is well intentioned for gig workers to fight the cost of living but it will lead to higher delivery and service costs which means higher costs for Seattle families Ander fewer orders for the gig workers.,48,,
371,0.97,2118.082,2132.396,"Because the proposal SETS such a high hourly wage, services to help grocery delivery, meal delivery and dog walking will see prices increase Inorder to afford the increased rate.",48,,
372,0.97,2132.396,2144.141,We urge the Council to set this aside until a study can be done to look at the impact.,48,,
373,0.97,2144.141,2146.644,Thank you for your consideration.,48,,
374,0.97,2146.644,2148.146,Thank you.,49,,
375,0.97,2148.146,2156.153,"Our next Speaker is Talisha Harrell, followed by rich Morris.",49,,
376,0.97,2156.153,2173.871,"Hi, I'm a Seattle gig worker and I'm Testifying on behalf and in support of the pay up.",50,,
377,0.97,2173.871,2181.345,Gig companies like door dash and Instacart claim that paying gig workers more will result in the price of services increasing for customers.,50,,
378,0.97,2181.345,2190.821,"These companies claim to be especially concerned about the impacts this will have on seniors, people with disabilities and low income customers that rely on the services.",50,,
379,0.97,2190.821,2194.392,This is a false premise for two important reasons.,50,,
380,0.97,2194.392,2197.929,One is that customers are essentially paying gig worker wages.,50,,
381,0.97,2197.929,2203.901,Many of those customers are the same populations that these companies claim to be so concerned for.,50,,
382,0.97,2203.901,2207.471,"Seniors, people with disabilities and low income customers.",50,,
383,0.97,2207.471,2216.213,Gig companies are often paying as low as $2 a job and are allowing the customers to supplement worker pay with their tips.,50,,
384,0.97,2216.213,2223.254,"So when these companies claim workers make $27 an hour, well most of that is a result of customer tip.",50,,
385,0.97,2223.254,2228.359,A worker should not need to depend on tips to earn a fair wage.,50,,
386,0.97,2228.359,2232.997,"Without customer tips, pay for these jobs would certainly be Subminimum.",50,,
387,0.97,2232.997,2239.237,Many gig workers can show you from their pay documents that 50% or more of their pay is from tips.,50,,
388,0.97,2239.237,2250.548,"The second flaw of this premise is that it completely ignores the facts that many seniors, people with disabilities, and low income folks are also gig workers.",50,,
389,0.97,2250.548,2262.493,"So these companies are not even recognizing that the folks from these communities are making up a large portion of the work force, the work force that makes the success of the Apps possible.",50,,
390,0.97,2262.493,2271.836,"If these companies care for seniors, people with disabilities, low income customers, wouldn't they want to acknowledge that they make up a sizable portion of their workforce?",50,,
391,0.97,2271.836,2283.648,"And wouldn't they want to express concern for their financial well being by paying seniors, people with disabilities for their work force a fair and equitable wage?",50,,
392,0.97,2283.648,2288.185,We don't need more data to know they need to pay their fair share.,50,,
393,0.97,2288.185,2289.153,Thank you.,51,,

415,0.97,2388.352,2404.201,We request the Council extend the process to make the time necessary to study the potential impacts as well as consider a number of amendments such as the current minute per mile formula with a minimum earning standard of at least 120% of minimum wage.,56,,
416,0.97,2404.201,2416.747,And in sharing the minimum focus on sharing only independent contractors and not W-2 employees who are already covered by city laws.,56,,

431,0.97,2473.537,2477.174,Also using multiple Apps at once was a standard back then.,58,,
432,0.97,2477.174,2487.485,Then the pandemic hit and businesses closed and people lost their source of income and people turned to gig working as a way to make ends meet.,58,,

460,0.97,2591.322,2596.06,I often wonder if the workers are paid enough.,60,,
461,0.97,2596.06,2598.896,Instacart pays so little up front for the service.,60,,
462,0.97,2598.896,2604.034,"As a customer, I can't tell how much Instacart workers pay.",60,,
463,0.97,2604.034,2608.806,I always try to tip well but I never know if it is enough.,60,,
464,0.97,2608.806,2625.923,"As someone who relies on gig delivery services, it would help my conscious to know the driver is making a living wage with what they are getting from the company and not up to the good will of customers to make sure gig workers have a decent living wage.",60,,
465,0.97,2625.923,2642.239,And I also think that some of the gig workers are touting the take home average pay because that doesn't cover people on the bottom end of the average or on the costs and taxes that are born by the gig workers.,60,,
466,0.97,2642.239,2645.643,Calls for a study are a delay tactic.,60,,
467,0.97,2645.643,2652.483,"During the $15 an hour wage campaign, the Chamber of Commerce cried about how worker wage increase killed business.",60,,

475,0.97,2674.405,2685.049,I am one of many Seattle area gig workers who have experienced the ups and downs of the gig economy.,62,,
476,0.97,2685.049,2689.053,I started with deliveries with door dash and post mates.,62,,
477,0.97,2689.053,2699.83,And then I switched to Instacart and have made a much more respectable income as a gig type of income to supplement my full-time job.,62,,
478,0.97,2699.83,2730.461,"I recently changed jobs and I have found a job that works well with my gig income but I still see and have been witnessing the frustrations of my fellow delivery workers and our exasperation and frustration with the way that Instacart and other delivery Apps are operated, customer interactions, attempting to resolve problems, Alic of transparency is a really big issue.",62,,
479,0.97,2730.461,2738.435,I feel passionate about addressing the Council to consider passing this proposal because we really need protections.,62,,
480,0.97,2738.435,2746.009,"I'm probably unique in the fact that I have no disabilities, I work full-time.",62,,

482,0.97,2750.214,2774.438,"I want to emphasize the fact that I have witnessed my fellow workers get frustrated with issues with timing, specifically like the App freezing or in limited cases, Harassment, or lack of access to public Restrooms, pandemic related issues.",62,,
483,0.97,2774.438,2785.549,"I know for a fact during the pandemic, it was challenging to make a living wage for delivery because there have been a number of challenges associated with the pandemic.",62,,
484,0.97,2785.549,2791.789,I said business is business but we need protections.,62,,
485,0.97,2791.789,2797.027,We need the gig companies to work with us and be fair and transparent.,62,,
486,0.97,2797.027,2800.13,Thank you so much.,63,,

489,0.97,2811.141,2816.113,I just want to thank the city council for taking the time to hear this humble man's words.,64,,
490,0.97,2816.113,2833.13,"I don't know if the Council is aware but in February of 2021, the FTC ordered Amazon to pay out $61.7 million of money of tips that with held from the gig workers.",64,,
491,0.97,2833.13,2838.735,And I received money from this settlement.,64,,
492,0.97,2838.735,2847.811,It was very Astonnishing and disappointing that some money that you work hard for that you contract for would with hold money and pay from you.,64,,
493,0.97,2847.811,2855.419,This creates for me a lack of trust and transparency.,64,,
494,0.97,2855.419,2862.559,So when I hear representatives from door dash say the average worker is making over $20.,64,,
495,0.97,2862.559,2866.597,I have never gotten close to making that much.,64,,
496,0.97,2866.597,2870.334,I discovered gig work when I was let go of a full-time job.,64,,
497,0.97,2870.334,2880.377,It allowed me to make some money to help pay the bills and not put the burden on my wife to meet all of our financial needs.,64,,
498,0.97,2880.377,2888.318,I heard the gentleman from door dash mention the Apps create flexibility which I agree with.,64,,
499,0.97,2888.318,2899.329,"It allows flexibility to spend time with my family, go to functions of my nieces and nephews at a normal 9 to 5 would not allow.",64,,
500,0.97,2899.329,2908.205,They want to label us as independent contractors but we have no say or negotiate our pay.,64,,
501,0.97,2908.205,2913.243,We have to accept what they offer.,64,,
502,0.97,2913.243,2917.281,It can go down from one day to the next or one order to the next.,64,,
503,0.97,2917.281,2921.785,I'm in support for the pay up campaign for transparency.,64,,
504,0.97,2921.785,2926.69,I hear them say that this is not meant to be a full-time job.,64,,
505,0.97,2926.69,2935.198,"It is a supplement income, whether that is true or not for each individual, fair pay should be fair pay.",64,,

523,0.97,3006.57,3008.405,"I'm Kimberley, a gig worker.",70,,
524,0.97,3008.405,3010.173,I support pay up legislation.,70,,
525,0.97,3010.173,3012.976,I'm also very adamant about keeping my flexibility.,70,,
526,0.97,3012.976,3018.582,I'm happy to see that pay up not only protects what flexibility I have but increases it.,70,,
527,0.97,3018.582,3021.351,I sat in stake holder meetings all last year.,70,,
528,0.97,3021.351,3023.587,The gig companies were encouraged to participate.,70,,
529,0.97,3023.587,3031.161,"They had plenty of time to request changes in the policy, study the situation and get ready for the changes on their back end.",70,,
530,0.97,3031.161,3039.236,Many chose instead to wait until the last minute to blast out misleading propaganda to defeat this reasonable policy.,70,,
531,0.97,3039.236,3050.514,"I have heard the scare tactics about gig workers losing work when in they will not have to work overtime anymore just to pay their bills, leaving more jobs on the table for other workers.",70,,
532,0.97,3050.514,3057.287,I have heard them threaten to raise prices when in fact they have made huge increases of profit while lowering our pay.,70,,
533,0.97,3057.287,3061.491,There is plenty of money to go around.,70,,
534,0.97,3061.491,3067.431,The problem is simple distribution.,70,,
535,0.97,3067.431,3070.267,Pay reasonable compensation before raking Enrecord profits.,70,,
536,0.97,3070.267,3074.738,I heard them say it wouldn't be equitable for people of color.,70,,
537,0.97,3074.738,3076.139,This is Laughable.,70,,
538,0.97,3076.139,3084.748,The way to help vulnerable populations is to pay them enough to provide for their families with enough left over to put money back in the local economy.,70,,
539,0.97,3084.748,3092.122,"40,000 people able to buy more would give our local economy a big boost.",70,,
540,0.97,3092.122,3097.627,Not like the current Boondoggle which Siphons off money to out of state.,70,,
541,0.97,3097.627,3105.502,They act as if we are greedy to want the same protections that other workers in the state enjoy.,70,,
542,0.97,3105.502,3107.637,Minimum wage is not a big ask.,70,,
543,0.97,3107.637,3109.573,We know the economic impact.,70,,
544,0.97,3109.573,3110.941,We have studied it for years.,70,,
545,0.97,3110.941,3114.511,Asking for more studies is a stall tactic.,70,,
546,0.97,3114.511,3118.348,Don't let them pull the wool over your eyes.,70,,
547,0.97,3118.348,3120.083,Pass pay up.,70,,
548,0.97,3120.083,3123.92,"Thank you, Kimberley.",71,,
549,0.97,3123.92,3129.726,"The next Speaker is Salah MENA and Elizabeth, both listed as not present.",71,,
550,0.97,3129.726,3138.101,So we will go to Sage Wilson followed by Melissa bees Ws.,71,,
551,0.97,3138.101,3142.105,"Hi, Sage Wilson with working Washington here in support of the pay up policy.",72,,
552,0.97,3142.105,3149.412,I want to just speak to the citation about the idea that workers are somehow making $28 an hour.,72,,
553,0.97,3149.412,3150.78,That sounds like a lot.,72,,
554,0.97,3150.78,3155.886,It would be quite a surprise to the workers you have been hearing from for the past year plus.,72,,
555,0.97,3155.886,3159.456,They are not making that much money.,72,,
556,0.97,3159.456,3170.834,"First of all, door dash's minimum rate is $2 regardless of time, miles, et cetera.",72,,
557,0.97,3170.834,3174.371,So where does that $28 number come from?,72,,
558,0.97,3174.371,3176.873,It is cited as an average.,72,,
559,0.97,3176.873,3188.451,"But even setting that aside, it is important to set aside, that number includes tips and does not account for Kneexpenses.",72,,
560,0.97,3188.451,3193.723,Shifting the expenses to the worker is such a big problem of how the gig economy is working.,72,,
561,0.97,3193.723,3204.568,"Think of pay roll taxes and mileage expenses, you are already talking about, even if $28 was accurate, we are already talking about less than minimum wage.",72,,
562,0.97,3204.568,3208.471,Which is why you have been hearing from workers for more than a year.,72,,
563,0.97,3208.471,3218.882,This is why door dash is number 12 of the list of companies in Washington state with the largest number of workers on food stamps.,72,,
564,0.97,3218.882,3225.922,And door dash is number 18 with the largest number of those on Medicare.,72,,
565,0.97,3225.922,3227.123,And Uber is similar ranking.,72,,
566,0.97,3227.123,3231.494,Our survey shows similar kind of impact of things like low pay.,72,,
567,0.97,3231.494,3238.301,64% reported they have less than $100 in their bank account at some point in the past year.,72,,
568,0.97,3238.301,3242.539,36% reported they have been unable to afford groceries.,72,,
569,0.97,3242.539,3253.717,"You know, finally, just the idea that a minimum pay after Expepss for your time is too high is absurd.",72,,
570,0.97,3253.717,3263.693,"We know when you raise pay, more people have more money and customers can spend at local businesses and it is a Win-Win.",72,,
571,0.97,3263.693,3280.143,Our last Speaker that we have listed that is showing as present is Melissa bees.,73,,
572,0.97,3280.143,3280.377,Melissa?,73,,
573,0.97,3280.377,3287.284,"Hi, I am current Lea gig worker.",74,,
574,0.97,3287.284,3290.086,I'm a full-time driver for Uber and Lyft.,74,,
575,0.97,3290.086,3297.961,I have done this for the last six years.,74,,
576,0.97,3297.961,3303.166,"As some people might not agree, like, I oppose having minimum wage.",74,,
577,0.97,3303.166,3304.034,I don't want a tax.,74,,
578,0.97,3304.034,3312.475,And I signed up to be a driver so I can work full-time and be my own boss.,74,,
579,0.97,3312.475,3315.111,Is why I signed up.,74,,
580,0.97,3315.111,3328.258,"Last year, during the pandemic was the biggest income profit that I have made the whole time I have been with Uber.",74,,
581,0.97,3328.258,3332.295,"So to say we are underpaid, I don't agree with that statement.",74,,
582,0.97,3332.295,3336.399,I do feel like we get a fair amount as our pay.,74,,
583,0.97,3336.399,3341.504,I don't want a cap on my pay.,74,,
584,0.97,3341.504,3346.676,I picked up a lot of regulars for years.,74,,
585,0.97,3346.676,3352.649,I have a very good rapport with my customers.,74,,
586,0.97,3352.649,3354.751,I feel that I'm adequately paid.,74,,
587,0.97,3354.751,3362.492,I do feel that we do deserve to have benefits as far as workers COMP.,74,,
588,0.97,3362.492,3379.943,I don't agree with it being postponed because we are risking driving every single day and making sure that our passengers are getting safely to their destinations.,74,,
589,0.97,3379.943,3381.244,Every single day we are in traffic.,74,,
590,0.97,3381.244,3390.353,I feel that we do a good job for the community out there and that we are fairly paid.,74,,
591,0.97,3390.353,3400.029,So I'm asking the Council to consider not putting a cap on our pay.,74,,
592,0.97,3400.029,3400.93,"Thank you, Melissa.",75,,
593,0.97,3400.93,3403.867,I did hear a reference to passengers.,75,,
594,0.97,3403.867,3405.468,This is not TNC legislation.,75,,
595,0.97,3405.468,3409.372,But we can follow up with you afterwards.,75,,
596,0.97,3409.372,3414.911,The last--we have another Speaker that was showing as not present that is now showing as present.,75,,
597,0.97,3414.911,3421.885,So I would like to go back up to Elizabeth Gilmore.,75,,
598,0.97,3421.885,3422.085,Elizabeth?,75,,
599,0.97,3422.385,3442.705,"Try again and hit Star six, Elizabeth.",76,,
600,0.97,3442.705,3444.808,"Oh, there you go.",76,,
601,0.97,3444.808,3453.716,"Sorry about that, guys.",77,,
602,0.97,3453.716,3459.022,My name is Elizabeth and I have been offering pet services through Rover for two years.,77,,
603,0.97,3459.022,3461.491,I normally do in Housesitting because it works best with my schedule.,77,,
604,0.97,3461.491,3464.694,I work a full-time job on the side.,77,,
605,0.97,3464.694,3467.33,I love the flexibility that Rover has.,77,,
606,0.97,3467.33,3478.741,It allows me to choose customers I have had before and choose my own rates . It helps me with the a supplemental income because we all know that Seattle is very expensive.,77,,
607,0.97,3478.741,3481.578,I am sharing my concerns today because it would impact me.,77,,
608,0.97,3481.578,3490.353,I set my rate to reflect the full range that a pet requires.,77,,
609,0.97,3490.353,3492.155,Obviously every pet is different.,77,,
610,0.97,3492.155,3499.863,"Sometimes I have very high energy dogs, sometimes I have relaxed dogs that want to sit and lie on the floor all day.",77,,
611,0.97,3499.863,3508.371,This flat rate that I set is a comfortable rate for me and my clients.,77,,
612,0.97,3508.371,3518.548,I have clients in Seattle and I feel it is a fair way to protect myself and my clients and I urge the Council to change the bill to protect my choices.,77,,
613,0.97,3518.548,3519.115,That is it.,77,,
614,0.97,3519.115,3520.783,Thank you so much for hearing me.,77,,
615,0.97,3520.783,3522.418,Thank you so much.,78,,
616,0.97,3522.418,3525.388,"With that, I think that is our last Speaker.",78,,
617,0.97,3525.388,3549.779,I do want to just touch on next steps . We had originally scheduled some time on our next committee meeting on the 10th to begin to actually hear from Councilmembers and a central staff on the amendments that they were seeking to put forward.,78,,
618,0.97,3549.779,3555.685,"We did go over not so much amendments, but concepts issue I.D.",78,,
619,0.97,3555.685,3586.182,"In the last committee meeting, but because we wanted to hear more from the public and more ideas to surface and also to get our Analytical staff more time to draft amendments, we are not having this topic on our agenda on May 10th, but we are going to be having it on our next committee meeting on May 24th.",78,,
620,0.97,3586.182,3592.455,"If I am Misspeaking, Alex, speak up.",78,,
621,0.97,3592.455,3593.89,That is correct.,79,,
622,0.97,3593.89,3594.157,Great.,80,,
623,0.97,3594.157,3596.059,Glad to hear it.,80,,
624,0.97,3596.059,3603.232,"And so, again, this topic is not on the agenda on May 10th.",80,,
625,0.97,3603.232,3626.589,"It will be on the agenda on May 24th and at that point, we will be hearing from Councilmembers on the amendments that they are entrusted in bringing forward based on both what we heard in Committee at the end of April and what we are hearing today and the other public input that we are receiving as we go every day.",80,,
626,0.97,3626.589,3643.439,"And with that, if there are no comments or questions from my Council colleagues--not seeing any raised hands.",80,,
627,0.97,3643.439,3645.241,"Thank you so much, everybody, for being with us.",80,,
628,0.97,3645.241,3646.075,It is 3:02 P.M.,80,,
629,0.97,3646.075,3647.443,And we are adjourned.,80,,
630,0.97,3647.443,3651.18,Thank you.,80,,
