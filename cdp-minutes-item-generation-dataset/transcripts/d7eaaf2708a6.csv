40,0.97,150.416,153.553,"Good morning, Councilmember Gonzalez and Councilmembers.",26,,
41,0.97,153.553,161.828,We are before you with your first state legislative briefing of the year and moving into the second week of the 2021 legislative session.,26,,
42,0.97,161.828,179.012,"This year, it's a long 105 day session where the leaders will write their biannual budget, and there were significant modifications that I will touch on briefly given the Coronavirus pandemic and recent security threat provoked by President Trump.",26,,
43,0.97,179.012,188.121,So the Capitol is currently closed to the public.,26,,
44,0.97,188.121,195.995,All advocacy is conducted remotely and the National Guard has been secured given the need for heightened security.,26,,
45,0.97,195.995,204.137,"My understanding is this will in place through Inauguration day, potentially longer, and we'll keep you posted.",26,,
46,0.97,204.137,228.361,"There are Democratic Majoritys in both chambers and legislative leadership in the house and Senate let us know their focus is for Covid Ray leaf and police change and equity, and given that it's a budget writing year, the state and local government are in need of resources for housing and believe services.",26,,
47,0.97,228.361,231.264,Revenue reform is high on the priority list.,26,,
48,0.97,231.264,242.175,We are hearing of growing interest in capital gains and other proposals in an effort to address tax incentives.,26,,
49,0.97,242.175,249.582,Quinn is our expert and will dive into that more in his report.,26,,
50,0.97,249.582,276.876,"We were making final changes from updates that we received late in the evening last night and just as we run through them for today, Quinn will provide an update on budget and revenue and education and general government, and Hannah the priorities and Robin will cover police reform and public housing and safety and mental illness.",26,,
51,0.97,276.876,290.556,I want to thank the gratitude to meet with the key allies in Olympia including Senator Wynn and representative frame to help us advance meaningful police and arrive new reform.,26,,
52,0.97,290.556,320.119,"I would like to thank Councilmember Herbold for participating in last week's sent labor Committee, speaking on their police arbitration reform proposals and on the De- certification bill, and with that, I'll turn to Quinn Majeski, our director.",26,,
53,0.97,320.119,322.055,"Good morning, Lily and Councilmembers.",27,,
54,0.97,322.055,329.228,I will go through the arrive new and education and environment and I will be back at the end for a quick update on transportation.,27,,
55,0.97,329.228,333.132,I'll pause at the end of each section for any questions.,27,,
56,0.97,333.132,343.609,"I'm going to cover the major bills, and if you have questions on any of the other bills listed, please feel free.",27,,
57,0.97,343.609,351.084,"Page one, the Capitol budget and operating budget are governor Inslee's proposed budget.",27,,
58,0.97,351.084,355.955,They received a hearing last week to a wide range of responses.,27,,
59,0.97,355.955,357.924,We've provided an update on those in December.,27,,
60,0.97,357.924,367.1,"Unless there are questions, I will go ahead and jump ahead to the capital gains tax proposal and discuss that briefly.",27,,
61,0.97,367.1,372.138,1596 is the capital gains tax proposal and also received a hearing last Thursday.,27,,
62,0.97,372.138,385.051,"There was, again, sort of a wide range as you might expect from advocates strongly in support of the proposal to those who are significantly against it.",27,,
63,0.97,385.051,390.523,The governor's proposal would Institute a 9 percent capital gains tax.,27,,
64,0.97,390.523,400.433,"There would be an exemption for capital gains under 25,000 for single Filers or 50,000 for joint Filers.",27,,
65,0.97,400.433,413.78,"There is an exemption for the sale of residential property, retirement pensions, and a handful of other categories, most related to Agriculture and other natural resources.",27,,
66,0.97,413.78,422.455,We have heard that the Senate Democrats are likely to introduce their own capital gains tax proposal later in the session.,27,,
67,0.97,422.455,426.926,The House may come out with theirs as well.,27,,
68,0.97,426.926,442.375,"So while this bill did kick off the discussion on capital gains, we do anticipate that there will be further Iteration and future discussion likely coming later in session as we get closer to serious budget negotiations.",27,,
69,0.97,442.375,454.387,"I do also want to touch on one Pre-Bill, a Protobill that is not on the list yet because it hasn't been filed yet.",27,,
70,0.97,454.387,457.089,The state wide payroll tax.,27,,
71,0.97,457.089,477.276,"This is legislation that the representatives are working on, Mackey and Springer, and it would Institute a state wide higher payroll tax on corporations, similar in which ways to the tax that was adopted last summer here at the local level.",27,,
72,0.97,477.276,522.655,"The current Iteration--and I would caution that this is very much a bill still in development and is likely to change, and I want to provide the information at this point but the current Iteration would Institute a tax on a--a statewide payroll tax on employers who employ more than $150,000 a year, and two tiers, a tier for employers whose gross receipts are between 7,0 00,100,000,000, .25 percent and for those over $100 million, point five percent.",27,,
73,0.97,522.655,532.031,"And it's similar in ways to the local measure adopted here but, obviously, has fewer tiers and a lower overall rate.",27,,
74,0.97,532.031,550.049,"The estimates that we've heard for this would be what is fully implemented and up and running at the state level which would be between $160,000,190,000,000 per year.",27,,
75,0.97,550.049,555.688,"So given the lower rates, actually less money than in the city of Seattle's version.",27,,
76,0.97,555.688,573.773,"There is--I know this is a point of concern, so I want to let folks know that there is currently no Preemption in the legislation but a topic of discussion and one we are monitoring closely and it's of interest to all of you.",27,,
77,0.97,573.773,576.342,Know that is very much on our radar.,27,,
78,0.97,576.342,582.782,We don't have an anticipated date for introduction of the payroll tax.,27,,
79,0.97,582.782,591.457,It's likely similar to the further Iterations for the capital gains tax to come later in session in February or potentially March.,27,,
80,0.97,591.457,598.497,I will--we'll cause in the budget and revenue category and see if there are any questions.,27,,
81,0.97,598.497,608.107,"Any questions or comments, and I would encourage you to use the raise your hand feature in zoom if you are able to.",28,,
82,0.97,608.107,628.961,"They made it easier to see on your bar at the bottom, easier to use, and if you can't find it, just let me know that you have questions or comments by just raising your hand if your camera is on or sending a message, and.",28,,
83,0.97,628.961,636.569,"So thank you, Madam President.",29,,
84,0.97,636.569,649.348,"Director Majeski, in the current Iteration proposed with governor Inslee's capital gains tax, when you said residential property, is that broadly all residential properties or primary residence?",29,,
85,0.97,649.348,660.86,I know a lot of previous bills included the primary residence.,29,,
86,0.97,660.86,672.104,My understanding is general property but I know the previous Iterations from the last sessions have included only primary but I can confirm that for you.,30,,
87,0.97,672.104,680.846,"Thank you, and another quick question in what the Senate proposed capital gains might entail.",31,,
88,0.97,680.846,691.09,What are you hearing are the primary areas of contention and how divergent from governor Inslee's proposal?,31,,
89,0.97,691.09,700.566,Because I know past state capital gains proposals had the earning cap much higher than the one that the governor has put forward.,31,,
90,0.97,700.566,703.536,It--let me put it this way.,31,,
91,0.97,703.536,713.712,Is there a potential that the legislator will propose a capital gains tax that will raise less revenue than what the governor's proposed or more?,31,,
92,0.97,713.712,723.122,"Obviously, my preference and I think most of my colleagues would be for a very robust, High-Revenue generating capital gains tax.",31,,
93,0.97,723.122,729.195,So want to see what we might be able to expect later in the session.,31,,
94,0.97,729.195,729.462,Yeah.,32,,
95,0.97,729.462,729.762,Absolutely.,32,,
96,0.97,729.762,754.587,"I hesitate to speculate too much given the nascent point, but based on the public testimony they may look at raising the threshold at which the capital gains tax kicks into effect from 25 to 50 to a potential higher rate.",32,,
97,0.97,754.587,782.181,"So there is certainly a possibility that they may have a proposal that RAISES left arrive new and a higher rate to offset that, and there are dials and levers that are looked at right now, and I don't want to say something that might have proven inaccurate.",32,,
98,0.97,782.181,790.189,"So I will say they are looking at a variety of different elements, and the threshold is one of them",32,,
99,0.97,790.189,790.99,"Great, thank you.",33,,
100,0.97,790.99,800.132,"Thank you for the question, Councilmember Sawant?",34,,
101,0.97,800.132,801.6,Thank you.,35,,
102,0.97,801.6,816.682,"I know the presentation has said that you are not hearing anything immediately from the state Legislature about Preexemption, some action to remove the Amazon tax on big businesses.",35,,
103,0.97,816.682,825.224,But I just wanted to see if you are able to go a little more into it in terms of what you have heard so far.,35,,
104,0.97,825.224,835.968,I understand if you have not heard much recently but I wanted to press the question a little bit further.,35,,
105,0.97,835.968,872.104,"What we saw from the crucial article that was published earlier this year--this was on January fourth--the article was presented in a problematic framing, and the title of the article is how Seattle tax complicates, somehow Inferring because our movement won the action in Seattle, that is preventing state leaders from moving.",35,,
106,0.97,872.104,873.572,And that's untrue.,35,,
107,0.97,873.572,884.817,"They had decades to do something about it and Ray fused to push back against the power of big business, and they kept negotiating with big business.",35,,
108,0.97,884.817,913.312,"In reality, if anything that the movement won the Amazon tax provided more pressure for state lawmakers, obviously, on top of the fact that there is a shortfall, and I know the Biden administration is coming up with positive proposals around the States but at the same time, that doesn't close the question of any way of the chronic under funding of services and housing and education and so on.",35,,
109,0.97,913.312,941.674,"Not to mention just a basic unfairness of big business, the wealthy doing little to nothing, and it's not--the message that they have sent at least on their statements earlier this month is we absolutely will keep the Seattle tax.",35,,
110,0.97,941.674,961.093,"For example, the representative quoted it remains an open question what happens with Seattle, and the state Senator the lead Senate writer said that lawmakers would probably want to create a double back on Seattle companies, Seattle- based companies.",35,,
111,0.97,961.093,969.368,All of this is extremely concerning especially doing what they already tried to do last spring.,35,,
112,0.97,969.368,985.017,They want defeated in their attempts because that was contingent of the March on to Olympia and in the with lawmakers.,35,,
113,0.97,985.017,994.36,But this is extremely concerning when they say that they are worrying about creating a double tax.,35,,
114,0.97,994.36,998.063,Have they seen how many taxes ordinary working people pay.,35,,
115,0.97,998.063,1002.668,I am wondering if you had more to add on that.,35,,
116,0.97,1002.668,1004.603,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,36,,
117,0.97,1004.603,1006.739,It's a point well taken.,36,,
118,0.97,1006.739,1018.851,"I think the framing of that material was concerning, you know, the fact that we used the tax that was available to us at the local level.",36,,
119,0.97,1018.851,1032.765,"To your question, I think, you know the Stakeholders that are concerned are likely business Stakeholders.",36,,
120,0.97,1032.765,1067.466,"I don't know the specifics of who is lobbying but that would be the Contirchlent, and I would add that it's a topic of legislatures and one that we are engaging on, and these are resources that we have in our budget to fund critical services especially in Covid times.",36,,
121,0.97,1067.466,1072.805,We are acutely aware of the contingent and advocate in our discussion.,36,,
122,0.97,1072.805,1078.076,"Thank you for that, Quinn.",37,,
123,0.97,1078.076,1082.981,Any other comments or questions before we move on?,37,,
124,0.97,1082.981,1083.182,Okay.,37,,
125,0.97,1083.182,1083.382,Okay.,37,,
126,0.97,1083.382,1085.25,Thank you so much.,37,,
127,0.97,1085.25,1090.222,And we will that over to get through the next question.,37,,
128,0.97,1090.222,1090.622,All right.,38,,
129,0.97,1090.622,1099.097,I'm going to try to move a little quickly because we have a lot of things to cover but just moving on to education.,38,,
130,0.97,1099.097,1127.659,"I want to highlight a few bills, 1153 regarding language access and direct Ospi to develop a language access program to be implemented by school districts across the state and establish several principles for a culturally responsive language access program and require the districts to report on them.",38,,
131,0.97,1127.659,1150.849,"Senate bill 5044, an equity inclusion and Antiracist training for school district directors, school district staff and individual school staff and encourage the school districts to provide three additional training days to implement the training policy.",38,,
132,0.97,1150.849,1156.455,Senate bill 5161 on teaching tribal history does what it says it does.,38,,
133,0.97,1156.455,1186.885,"It requires the school districts to incorporate Washington state's tribal history into their curricula and direct the superintendent of public instruction or SPI to monitor the implementation and Senate bill 5237 is companion bill, 1213, a child care and early learning omnibus bill.",38,,
134,0.97,1186.885,1190.222,It does a variety of things.,38,,
135,0.97,1190.222,1214.346,"It increases the subsidies for child care providers and increases the eligibility for the working child care protection program and reduces Co-Pays for that program and expands E-Cap enrollment, and adds--increases the subsidies to the providers.",38,,
136,0.97,1214.346,1233.298,"I would add this is definitely a significant expansion and discussion included potential revenue sources, a version that was ultimately dropped doesn't include a dedicated funding source.",38,,
137,0.97,1233.298,1242.808,This would need to be funded through the appropriations process.,38,,
138,0.97,1242.808,1243.241,I'll pause there.,38,,
139,0.97,1243.241,1250.916,Just one quick question on the bill that you are referring to.,39,,
140,0.97,1250.916,1260.592,"You can tell me if this bill is a particular age group and if so, what are the age groups that focused?",39,,
141,0.97,1260.592,1264.262,First to five or three and Four- year-olds?,39,,
142,0.97,1264.262,1265.297,You can give us that?,39,,
143,0.97,1265.297,1272.037,I would have to get back to you on that.,40,,
144,0.97,1272.037,1272.571,Great.,41,,
145,0.97,1272.571,1279.311,I think it would be helpful to get an understanding of those details.,41,,
146,0.97,1279.311,1300.265,"The see of Seattle has been doing a lot of work on increasing the amount of support to the child care providers and those in need of child care in particular, and we have the preschool program for Three-Year-Olds now and Four-Year-Olds.",41,,
147,0.97,1300.265,1310.442,It's a high priority for me to the spectrum of child care Ng needs of the ages birth to five.,41,,
148,0.97,1310.442,1316.381,"So if we could get more information about that, that would be really helpful.",41,,
149,0.97,1316.381,1316.648,Yeah.,42,,
150,0.97,1316.648,1326.091,"Absolutely, and I would add that the staff did meet with the representative over the interim to provide feedback on the legislation.",42,,
151,0.97,1326.091,1331.263,They are reviewing the current Iteration now.,42,,
152,0.97,1331.263,1336.335,It dropped late last week and I will be happy to follow up on that,42,,
153,0.97,1336.335,1339.805,"Great, any other comments on education?",43,,
154,0.97,1339.805,1340.005,Okay.,43,,
155,0.97,1340.005,1340.405,Looks like none.,43,,
156,0.97,1340.405,1341.239,All right.,44,,
157,0.97,1341.239,1343.642,Moving on to environment.,44,,
158,0.97,1343.642,1345.077,A few bills to highlight.,44,,
159,0.97,1345.077,1359.891,"As well, we mentioned this is a priority area for the House Democrats and I think it's reflected by really potent legislation that they have introduced.",44,,
160,0.97,1359.891,1387.152,"House bill 1084, the building Decarbonization and known as governor Inslee's healthy homes building act requires by 2027 significant reductions in the emissions from residential and commercial buildings and largely, not completely but prohibits new buildings from including on site fossil fuels.",44,,
161,0.97,1387.152,1422.954,It also institutes a surcharge on natural gas Flues in buildings and includes legislation that you all may recall from last year ordering beneficial building Electification that extends the authority currently granted to private companies and private utility companies to published utilities to provide incentives for switching to electric power in buildings.,44,,
162,0.97,1422.954,1443.775,Moving on I would just hit briefly 1099 which makes several changes to the growth management act to incorporate addressing climate change at the planning processes.,44,,
163,0.97,1443.775,1450.682,Then moving on to the governor's climate commitment act.,44,,
164,0.97,1450.682,1490.555,"This does a variety of things I am happy to follow up in more detail on afterwards but it implements a state wide cap and trade program and directs Enolgy for the emissions targets and develops an auction system and creates a priority for linking with other markets in Oregon and California, and most notably, and it allows the program for offset projects to be provided over implemented by Emitters.",44,,
165,0.97,1490.555,1520.418,And beyond the cap and invest program it restores another bill from last year that didn't last but restores the regulation of Non- Source.Emissions which was invalidated in 2019 after a Supreme Court case so it restores that authority which is an important regulatory authority for meeting our climate emissions target.,44,,
166,0.97,1520.418,1554.653,"And finally, just to briefly touch on Senate bill 5141, the Iteration of the act that requires a variety of state agencies including health, resources, Commerce and Tional transportation to adopt environmental adjust strategic plans and equitable engagement and community engagement policies and adopt evaluation Metrics for evaluating potential projects for environmental justice impact.",44,,
167,0.97,1554.653,1560.859,And I'll stop on environment and see if there are any questions.,44,,
168,0.97,1560.859,1561.426,Councilmember Herbold?,45,,
169,0.97,1561.426,1562.093,Thank you.,46,,
170,0.97,1562.093,1576.775,I want to just hear a little bit about House bill 1075 the emissions from vehicles with on demand sensors.,46,,
171,0.97,1576.775,1577.142,Absolutely.,47,,
172,0.97,1577.142,1585.951,So this was a bill that was introduced last year and was Unfortunately tied up in the Senate transportation committee.,47,,
173,0.97,1585.951,1603.034,The bill would require the different Ecology to develop emission production targets with companies and require the companies to submit a plan for reducing the emissions associated with their fleet.,47,,
174,0.97,1603.034,1609.541,And I know this is an area of concern last year.,47,,
175,0.97,1609.541,1618.85,It does contain a specific direction to develop program elements and rules that mitigate impacts to low income drivers.,47,,
176,0.97,1618.85,1635.033,There is obviously a nexus there in wanting to make sure that folks who are driving for their livelihood are not impacted at the companies that reduce their emission.,47,,
177,0.97,1635.033,1635.4,Thank you.,48,,
178,0.97,1635.4,1639.738,Thanks for that.,49,,
179,0.97,1639.738,1643.575,Any other questions on environment?,49,,
180,0.97,1643.575,1645.343,"Hearing none, let's keep going.",49,,
181,0.97,1645.343,1647.379,All right.,50,,
182,0.97,1647.379,1659.824,"My last section before transportation, general government, the only one that I want to highlight is House bill 1056.",50,,
183,0.97,1659.824,1668.266,"This makes permanent for future declared emergencies the current open public meetings act, procedures around remote electronic meetings.",50,,
184,0.97,1668.266,1680.011,I would just add also that the bill is specifically future declared emergencies.,50,,
185,0.97,1680.011,1690.889,The legislature adopted the Senate current regulations 8402 which extends the current policy set?,50,,
186,0.97,1690.889,1694.392,Place by the governor's proclamation.,50,,
187,0.97,1694.392,1714.145,"So for the duration of the Covid-19 health crisis, the site of Seattle and other municipalities can conduct their business as they have been but this would establish for future emergencies that the procedures are allowed to continue.",50,,
188,0.97,1714.145,1717.682,Thank you for that.,51,,
189,0.97,1717.682,1719.117,Any questions on governing?,51,,
190,0.97,1719.117,1724.923,"Hearing none, I think we will head over now to Robin.",51,,
191,0.97,1724.923,1726.157,"Councilmember Gonzalez, thank you.",52,,
192,0.97,1726.157,1728.893,I will try and go quickly as well.,52,,
193,0.97,1728.893,1734.365,First I'm going to address housing and homelessness and affordable.,52,,
194,0.97,1734.365,1740.171,A couple of things that the Council will be interested in.,52,,
195,0.97,1740.171,1753.618,House bill 1236 has been reintroduced this year and I know that is of interest to this Council because of some impacts that it would have on the just cause Eviction law we have in Seattle.,52,,
196,0.97,1753.618,1761.059,"Also, the governor's Eviction moratorium as I believe you are well aware expires on March 31 of 2021.",52,,
197,0.97,1761.059,1769.801,The Legislature has a couple of proposals to address what happens once the moratorium is no longer in effect.,52,,
198,0.97,1769.801,1794.926,"The first is Senate bill 5139 which prohibits all rent increases for six months after the expiration, and then the six to 12 months after that would limit it to 6 percent over the consumer price index increase.",52,,
199,0.97,1794.926,1835.9,"Senate bill 5160 also provides some additional protections for tenants after the expiration of the Eviction moratorium and prohibit Evictions for two years after the public health emergency ends, when the Covid- 19 emergency ends and prohibit late fees and establish payment plans based on the tenant's financial situation and establish the right to counsel too, and make funds for assist Toons property owners.",52,,
200,0.97,1835.9,1843.975,Those are the bills I wanted to touch on since we are short on time and I will answer any questions.,52,,
201,0.97,1843.975,1846.077,Any questions for Robin?,53,,
202,0.97,1846.077,1846.711,All right.,53,,
203,0.97,1846.711,1849.08,"And hearing none, let's keep going.",53,,
204,0.97,1849.08,1861.559,I'm going to shift to public safety am not going into a lot of details but Senate bill 6217 would prohibit assault weapons.,54,,
205,0.97,1861.559,1869.1,It was introduced and several bills that would limit open carry of firearms.,54,,
206,0.97,1869.1,1872.003,We expect more in the coming weeks.,54,,
207,0.97,1872.003,1883.948,"Police reform, of course is a big topic this session and there are proposals that are already introduced.",54,,
208,0.97,1883.948,1886.317,I will highlight a couple.,54,,
209,0.97,1886.317,1908.573,"House bill 1054 on police tactics that would ban Chokeholds, unleash police dogs, military equipment, use of tear gas, and no knock warrants, and vehicle pursuits was heard last week in the public safety committee and is scheduled for an executive session.",54,,
210,0.97,1908.573,1911.943,I will say there were concerns raised with aspects of the bill.,54,,
211,0.97,1911.943,1918.883,I would like to see amendments to address the issues raised by law enforcement and cities as well.,54,,
212,0.97,1918.883,1925.79,"And then House bill 1267 on police use of force, that was just drafted yesterday.",54,,
213,0.97,1925.79,1940.872,This would codify the recommendation of the governor's tax force of independent investigation to create a statewide office to address use of deadly force by law enforcement.,54,,
214,0.97,1940.872,1959.09,"So that bill should have a hearing I think probably next week is what I understand, and so if anyone would want to weigh in or testify, I think that would be most welcome.",54,,
215,0.97,1959.09,2006.637,"The De-Certification bills were heard yesterday and on Friday House bill 1082 on Friday and Senate bill 5051 on the oversight and accountability of the police officer, and the Councilmember's testimony, and this would create a license or a system similar to other professions like teachers and other workers, attorneys, accountants who have licensed their system and would prevent officers who have been discharged or resigned and discharged other employ employment and give additional Dutyies and training requirements as well.",54,,
216,0.97,2006.637,2037.935,"And the hearing that was held last Thursday, Senate bill 5055 which would establish the pool of Arbitrators for police disciplinary cases and also list a number of acts that would automatically discharge an officer if they were found to have committed those acts.",54,,
217,0.97,2037.935,2071.102,"You know, I would say that the hearing did go well and we are pursuing a strategy to amend likely Senate Wynn's bill that would not completely eliminate arbitration but create Guardrails around the process and thank Councilmember Herbold for Testifying at that hearing.",54,,
218,0.97,2071.102,2071.669,Councilmember Herbold?,55,,
219,0.97,2071.669,2155.386,"Thank you, and I wonder if addition to pursuing the strategy that focuses on the amendments to the arbitration process as identified by the Mayor's office and Oir as what I agree are important reforms and identify with the Top- related reforms with the city's entering into the next set of bargaining as identified by accountability partners and the public hearing held by Council President Gonzalez at the end of 2019 to codify a resolution through my Committee in early 2020 so there is really a good alignment there as it relates to the cities priorities for their own contracts and why some of the police accountability advocates that represent the city are supporting the Soloman bill is out of recognition that there are impediments in state law to keep us from reforms or perhaps eliminating arbitration.",56,,
220,0.97,2155.386,2182.179,"But I want to speak to politically recognizing this may not be the section where there is a political--I have a hard time imagining a state legislative session where there is more momentum to do police reform, I hope.",56,,
221,0.97,2182.179,2196.727,"But if there isn't a political will to eliminate arbitration, I would hate for the entirety of the bill to be put aside because of that part of the bill.",56,,
222,0.97,2196.727,2234.031,"Just like we were looking to use the window as a vehicle for important reform that the city, of course, and police accountability Stakeholders in the next round of negotiation, I think there are other useful reforms in the Soloman bill and there may not be the resistance to as there is to the element of eliminating arbitration.",56,,
223,0.97,2234.031,2239.503,That's a piece of a very large bill that speaks to a lot of things.,56,,
224,0.97,2239.503,2251.749,I think it would be useful to engage with the Stakeholders to see if there are other elements of the bill to support moving forward.,56,,
225,0.97,2251.749,2256.587,"Certainly, Councilmember Herbold and point well taken.",57,,
226,0.97,2256.587,2279.744,"And we did also Syphon went of the bill and working with the advocates working on the bill and will continue to pursue and see if there is a path forward with the advocates on both sides of the issue bill, certainly.",57,,
227,0.97,2279.744,2288.119,I just think there is a public narrative that the bill is all about arbitration.,58,,
228,0.97,2288.119,2301.632,That is certainly the thing that is creating the interest in the conflict and drama with a lot of other important things with the will.,58,,
229,0.97,2301.632,2315.713,So I want to shift the narrative to focus on what is in the bill other than just the arbitration.,58,,
230,0.97,2315.713,2316.113,Absolutely.,59,,
231,0.97,2316.113,2321.686,It's the big ticket item but there are many other provisions.,59,,
232,0.97,2321.686,2329.093,Any other questions or comments?,60,,
233,0.97,2329.093,2329.293,Okay.,60,,
234,0.97,2329.293,2335.599,"Hearing none, let's go ahead and continue on.",60,,
235,0.97,2335.599,2336.267,Okay.,61,,
236,0.97,2336.267,2336.567,Thank you.,61,,
237,0.97,2336.567,2342.039,I'm going to go back to page four for Healthcare.,61,,
238,0.97,2342.039,2344.008,Just a few bills.,61,,
239,0.97,2344.008,2347.712,"Senate bill 5052, establishes health equity.",61,,
240,0.97,2347.712,2362.193,It requires the Department Department of health to create the data with adult projects and support the projects.,61,,
241,0.97,2362.193,2376.173,Senate bill 5068 is Postpartum Medicaid and passed last session with the end of the emerging Covid and budget cuts.,61,,
242,0.97,2376.173,2388.853,"It was Re-Introduced and would examine the Post-Partum health coverage, 50 days.",61,,
243,0.97,2388.853,2395.693,"Senate bill 5149, health bill 1201 is the Foundational health spending.",61,,
244,0.97,2395.693,2407.571,This is a Governor-Request bill and the funding would go to supporting public health serves.,61,,
245,0.97,2407.571,2424.288,"In the 2019-2021, this would be $12 million for public health services, and that money would include substance abuse prevention and prevention of vapor and tobacco products for minors.",61,,
246,0.97,2424.288,2430.694,I will pause on Healthcare if there is any questions.,61,,
247,0.97,2430.694,2433.164,Questions or comments?,62,,
248,0.97,2433.164,2437.568,Looks like there aren't any.,62,,
249,0.97,2437.568,2438.002,Go ahead.,62,,
250,0.97,2438.002,2438.769,Great.,63,,
251,0.97,2438.769,2467.398,"Jumping down to the middle of page eight, House bill 1072, legal aid Fund, and it removes the prohibition on the use of civic legal aid fund on the office of legal aid to represent individuals here without legal authority.",63,,
252,0.97,2467.398,2483.047,"House bill 1073 expands case family and medical leave program and changes the threshold from 820 to the minimum of $1,000 earned.",63,,
253,0.97,2483.047,2497.127,That expands the definition of family member and removes the employee threshold for more eligibility.,63,,
254,0.97,2497.127,2505.169,House bill 1151 with economic recovery is a priority bill for human service advocates.,63,,
255,0.97,2505.169,2532.73,"It does a variety of things, modernizing the needs for assistance program for current living expenses in our state from 1991, so well overdue there and it extends the eligibility for transitional assistance and the one-time cap benefit to an additional five months for the benefit.",63,,
256,0.97,2532.73,2540.905,And the disaster cap assistance program to households to receive benefits more than once in 12 months when there is a declared emergency.,63,,
257,0.97,2540.905,2547.311,It has a lot of provisions to help people in the midst of this crisis.,63,,
258,0.97,2547.311,2549.513,Those are the highlights in that section.,63,,
259,0.97,2549.513,2553.684,I am happy to take any questions.,63,,
260,0.97,2553.684,2555.786,Any questions or comments?,64,,
261,0.97,2555.786,2555.986,Okay.,64,,
262,0.97,2555.986,2561.292,Looks like there are none.,64,,
263,0.97,2561.292,2562.359,You can keep going.,64,,
264,0.97,2562.359,2564.895,I'll round it out with transportation.,65,,
265,0.97,2564.895,2569.7,The only bill currently on the list is House bill 1091.,65,,
266,0.97,2569.7,2589.586,"This is the clean fuel standard which has been a major environmental and crossing over into transportation priority for several years now especially for the chair of the House environment Committee, and it's very similar to last year.",65,,
267,0.97,2589.586,2598.062,It would require a 10 percent reduction in the carbon intensity and a 20 percent reduction by 2035.,65,,
268,0.97,2598.062,2615.813,"The only other thing I would highlight in the transportation space is we do anticipate that the representative, the chair of the House transportation Committee, be out with his transportation revenue package proposal today.",65,,
269,0.97,2615.813,2644.475,"What we have heard is it's likely to include a pot of money for capital projects in addition to Prioritizing maintenance and preservation, the state legal requirement for the fish passage barriers and Culverts, and it's likely to include money for cap tap investments but it would not identify specific projects at this point.",65,,
270,0.97,2644.475,2662.493,So that process will continue to be discussed and associated between the chair and ranking members and leadership as they continue to advance a potential transportation revenue package.,65,,
271,0.97,2662.493,2667.197,That is something that we'll be on the look out for.,65,,
272,0.97,2667.197,2676.44,The city has significant transportation means that we'll continue to advocate for but we are not likely to get specific feedback or indication this afternoon.,65,,
273,0.97,2676.44,2678.909,"With that, I'll toss it to you.",65,,
274,0.97,2678.909,2686.316,"Thank you, Quinn, and I see Councilmember Strauss has a question.",66,,
275,0.97,2686.316,2691.321,"Talk, Council president and to the entire Oir team.",67,,
276,0.97,2691.321,2701.298,"You do a wonderful job presenting this on black Friday and yesterday, and I appreciate the good work you have put into the legislative priority in Olympia.",67,,

278,0.97,2705.769,2746.71,"I want to again highlight the work and thank Sdot to bring over the numbers that we need for the Ballard Bay Interregional transportation corridor, and for everyone, the regional transportation corridor is the most used North/South corridor after SR 99 or I-5 . So if anything should happen to those corridors this is how people will get North or South for much of our city extending from the Stadiums to the northern city border at 145Th.",67,,
279,0.97,2746.71,2755.619,"So, Quinn, you will see another NOTE from my office today and thank you for all your great work on there.",67,,
280,0.97,2755.619,2760.224,"And colleagues, I will make my final comment so I don't have to pop back.",67,,
281,0.97,2760.224,2779.977,"I want to thank again Robin for all your work, and I know I thanked everyone but the Association of Washington city was able to testify in support of the De-Certification bill 1088, the Goodman version 5051, the Senator Peterson version.",67,,
282,0.97,2779.977,2795.192,It was really wonderful to be able to be there with deputy Mayor block from Tacoma and the Council President Beggs from Spokane and the general advocate who also testified.,67,,
283,0.97,2795.192,2804.301,I know there has been some questions about the value of the Association over the last number of years.,67,,
284,0.97,2804.301,2811.742,I wanted to take this moment to highlight they are indeed signing in support and Testifying in support of priorities.,67,,
285,0.97,2811.742,2814.344,"Thank you, Council President.",67,,
286,0.97,2814.344,2818.148,Those are all of my comments for all of Oir.,67,,
287,0.97,2818.148,2828.792,"Thank you, everyone, for your great work.",67,,
288,0.97,2828.792,2830.16,"Thank you, Councilmember.",68,,
289,0.97,2830.16,2840.17,"Thank you, Council president and thank you forward update and tell us if you have already addressed this.",69,,
290,0.97,2840.17,2844.942,I am sure this is a question that everyone else needs an answer to.,69,,
291,0.97,2844.942,2855.385,Anything in the state Legislature dealing with helping the city of Seattle acquire the necessary funds for bridge systems for especially the West Seattle bridge?,69,,
292,0.97,2855.385,2866.83,And we have been talking about that a lot and so appreciative of our senators and also our good representation.,69,,
293,0.97,2866.83,2877.875,But I am wondering any funds committed to the state Legislature?,69,,
294,0.97,2877.875,2884.047,"Thank you for that question, Councilmember Mosqueda.",70,,
295,0.97,2884.047,2889.419,"Currently, the baseline transportation budget is in the $500 million deficit.",70,,
296,0.97,2889.419,2894.825,They are currently Pausing projects that would be going out for construction and bid.,70,,
297,0.97,2894.825,2901.732,"In the baseline transportation budget, there is no money available for supporting the West Seattle bridge.",70,,
298,0.97,2901.732,2945.275,"However, over the interim and through the first week of session, we have been in conversations with a number of legislators in the Seattle delegation and on the transportation committees about the support for the West Seattle bridge in partnership with Seattle, and I think there is strong support for the West Seattle bridge not just in the city of Seattle but the regional and state wide economic aspect and mobility aspect and in the transportation revenue package, there is support for the West Seattle bridge repair.",70,,
299,0.97,2945.275,2957.587,The reason I said there would be no specific projects in the chair 5 proposal this afternoon is with respect to specific regards to that.,70,,
300,0.97,2957.587,2978.642,And we have received feedback but he will not be naming any specific projects at this juncture so we have to wait to see how it develops.,70,,
301,0.97,2978.642,2998.295,"Great question, Councilmember Mosqueda, and I will have to look into the West Seattle bridge project to the regional Council and I will talk on that in a moment, and Councilmember Herbold I see your hand up, but I will bring Councilmember Lewis and then to you Councilmember Herbold.",71,,
302,0.97,2998.295,2999.496,"Thank you, Madam President.",72,,
303,0.97,2999.496,3017.414,"I don't know who on the team this would be for but I wanted to ask about Senate bill 5138, eliminating the no tax deduction for financial institutions and putting that money into affordable housing.",72,,
304,0.97,3017.414,3055.519,I wonder if folks could indicate where the bill is and what the probability of it passing is and how much additional revenue that would generate in a given year and what the implications might be fish how--how that would be administered with grants or Remitances to governments like ours.,72,,
305,0.97,3055.519,3060.524,We will certainly follow up with you but I will turn it over to Robin.,73,,
306,0.97,3060.524,3063.326,"Oh, no worries.",74,,
307,0.97,3063.326,3068.398,This bill would create a permanent funding for the housing trust fund.,74,,
308,0.97,3068.398,3083.447,"So it would work similarly as it does now, you know, like the projects do now and Thild then apply to the state for the housing trust fund money.",74,,
309,0.97,3083.447,3108.972,"But rather than having to carve out and advocate every Yea, there would be a steady normal force for that and they could adopt additional capital investments but that would create a steady funding source.",74,,
310,0.97,3108.972,3123.553,"I don't know how much Mooney it would generate but I don't know what the likelihood of success on the bill is, but the city is certainly supporting it, and is engaged in conversations around it.",74,,
311,0.97,3123.553,3132.362,So we can keep you posted on the progress as it moves along and can I get back to you as how much revenue it would generate each year.,74,,

313,0.97,3137.701,3137.934,No.,75,,

319,0.97,3158.989,3191.621,"I don't understand how, director Majeski, that there are no funds allocated for the particular project corresponding to Senator Hobbs' intent to identify $75 million to assist Satle in repairing the West Seattle bridge in recognition that it's a regional asset to our regional economy.",77,,

322,0.97,3200.397,3207.837,"Specifically, I was referring to the representative's transportation package proposal coming up today.",78,,
323,0.97,3207.837,3223.053,So I would say potentially to declare that there is--we expect he will identify a pot of money that will be for Capitol improvement projects which could include the West Seattle bridge.,78,,
324,0.97,3223.053,3229.726,But at this time he is not going to be identifying specific projects.,78,,
325,0.97,3229.726,3250.981,"So, you know, as Associates move along, we expect Senator Hobbs will release an update to the proposal that he came out with last year, later in session, and we don't have an exact date but we anticipate that funding for specific Capitol projects will be identified as negotiations continue.",78,,
326,0.97,3250.981,3260.457,We just don't anticipate that the proposal that will be released today will have those identified.,78,,
327,0.97,3260.457,3278.241,You're saying that you still believe that Hobbs's forward Washington proposal will identify use of revenue for specific projects including the West Seattle bridge?,79,,
328,0.97,3278.241,3281.177,At this point.,80,,

336,0.97,3321.851,3327.357,Maybe it has an odd name so it's not popping for me.,83,,

378,0.97,3602.832,3620.75,The factor that must be addressed before anything in the bill can become a reality is the capital funding to move the Washington state National Guard to North bend.,96,,
379,0.97,3620.75,3624.921,I believe it's $35 or $55 million that is needed.,96,,

450,0.97,4528.156,4544.606,"The significant impact of the bridge on thousands of drivers and workers on this economy were understood, and the staff and Committee worked together to renegotiation to get this through, and I am thankful for that.",104,,
451,0.97,4544.606,4546.875,This discussion was going on since July.,104,,
452,0.97,4546.875,4550.045,We had a robust meeting on December 10th.,104,,
453,0.97,4550.045,4569.765,And I want to thank Councilmember Pedersen for stepping in which the Councilmember could not make it and thank the member for being there.,104,,
454,0.97,4569.765,4588.45,"We had a slight $2 million decrease and the Psrt transportation board where the contracts come from and the Federal money, I think it's a high program, that money is designated for bridges.",104,,
455,0.97,4588.45,4597.192,"I think what we tried to stress the most, Council President, this was an emergency situation.",104,,
456,0.97,4597.192,4598.193,It wasn't planned.,104,,
457,0.97,4598.193,4606.735,It's not like we didn't know any other bridges had issues and we were asking for money.,104,,
458,0.97,4606.735,4622.618,This was circumstances that were unforeseen and had to spend the money that was designated for bridges and seemed like a natural fit and a proviso is that the city stays out of the next round.,104,,
459,0.97,4622.618,4631.36,"I think Councilmember Gonzalez can direct me but I think we can only ask for one project in the next round, and that will come up next year.",104,,
460,0.97,4631.36,4635.163,"So with that, that's it reporting from D5 up North.",104,,
461,0.97,4635.163,4636.631,"Back to you, Council President.",104,,
462,0.97,4636.631,4638.266,Like our own TV show.,105,,
463,0.97,4638.266,4638.6,Exactly.,106,,
464,0.97,4638.6,4649.111,That's what I want to do now.,106,,
465,0.97,4652.147,4653.615,"Back to you, Councilmember Juarez.",106,,
466,0.97,4653.615,4662.457,"And anyone who wants to make comments or ask bees, feel free to raise your hand.",106,,
467,0.97,4662.457,4679.975,"Thank you very much, and Councilmember Juarez, does this affect future projects or just those under construction?",107,,
468,0.97,4679.975,4681.276,No.,108,,
469,0.97,4681.276,4686.715,The realignment is for future projects--projects that are under construction or safe.,108,,
470,0.97,4686.715,4692.12,I shouldn't use the word safe.,108,,
471,0.97,4692.12,4694.723,"Project and planning, possibly.",108,,
472,0.97,4694.723,4713.341,"Never before scenarios, like delay, you know, in phases and the four things to look at under--I think it's resolution 2016-17 which says what the board can look at.",108,,
473,0.97,4713.341,4716.745,But projects that are already happening are already happening.,108,,
474,0.97,4716.745,4725.487,And projects that are in the future is what we will be looking at.,108,,
475,0.97,4725.487,4733.195,"The realignment to be Frank, probably the biggest issue in determining how we look at this is the engineering and draft.",108,,
476,0.97,4733.195,4740.135,So I will have more for you and be more specific but that's about all we have right now.,108,,
477,0.97,4740.135,4755.917,And I do have the realignment workshop this Thursday so income Monday I will have more information and be specific.,108,,
478,0.97,4755.917,4767.596,And Mr. Robak gave issues and isn't it more depth because he is the Ceo of sound transit and knows a little more than I do.,108,,
479,0.97,4767.596,4773.401,But this Pandemic-Fueled recession has taken a beating on sound transit.,108,,
480,0.97,4773.401,4821.616,"And one of the options that is left, my understanding is that it will do and Mr. Robak said as well that we go to Olympia and ask to raise the tax on more borrowing and with the new administration and the Biden administration and the new head of D.O.T., Mayor Buttigieg, we do not believe he will be confirmed until May but Washington state gets the most money for transportation and there are reasons for that, but I think what we look at is the administration that is more friendly and more understanding.",108,,
481,0.97,4821.616,4830.258,We have a great congressional delegation including a Congresswoman who is a big advocate for us in the Hospitallation issues.,108,,
482,0.97,4830.258,4845.674,"So we have a lot of weight to go to the state and county and government for more money to make sure that the Ballard West Seattle Lightrail system, one of those options get built.",108,,
483,0.97,4845.674,4847.075,"Which one, I don't know.",108,,
484,0.97,4847.075,4896.458,"Thank you for that question and the information, and I do want to thank the former Councilmember Pacheco for Emailing the detailed information on the challenges faced by transit, and it seems to me that the board--my sense is that you are still very much in the thoughtful stages of trying to figure out what will happen next.",109,,
485,0.97,4896.458,4919.414,My understanding from Email and communication is we can and should participate there will be impact to the sound transit plan and in light of increased cost and recession and the increased task of Covid moving forward.,109,,
486,0.97,4919.414,4941.469,"So that does put pressure on the--the alignment that we have considered as part of the sound transit efforts over the last couple years when we were looking at the varying alignments through West Seattle, Ballard, downtown, et cetera.",109,,
487,0.97,4941.469,4969.698,So my sense from reviewing the materials is they haven't decided what the impact will be but they are wanting to make sure we understand early on there is likely going to be an impact and and a fleet of options to be considered by the transit board with the possibility of having to suspend work altogether.,109,,
488,0.97,4969.698,4991.72,"So I think it's fair to say that the projects will be evaluated are ones that were very early in the project planning stage of which, unfortunately, several of the realignments is that we were envisioning for the Seattle corridor and region are a part of.",109,,
489,0.97,4991.72,4997.258,So I recognize this is a difficult challenge for sound transit and for our region.,109,,
490,0.97,4997.258,5016.678,And I think there will be a lot of work ahead of us to work with your regional partners to figure out how to deliver on the voter intent and desired intent of sound transit under the reality of the physical constraints.,109,,
491,0.97,5016.678,5024.953,I am hopeful that we will see help from the Federal Government to facilitate implement of voter intent.,109,,
492,0.97,5024.953,5032.494,"Right, and Council President, you served on the elected leaders group with Councilmember Herbold.",110,,
493,0.97,5032.494,5035.096,I am not saying everything that happens throws that out now.,110,,
494,0.97,5035.096,5038.566,We had the session and it's like hold up.,110,,
495,0.97,5038.566,5043.571,Let us get our feet under us and see the projects.,110,,
496,0.97,5043.571,5049.377,We have to go through with what we promised the voters.,110,,
497,0.97,5049.377,5054.149,We promised the voters Lightrail for West Seattle.,110,,
498,0.97,5054.149,5056.785,Some projects will be delayed and some in phases.,110,,
499,0.97,5056.785,5061.089,But it will get done.,110,,
500,0.97,5061.089,5072.801,I think what Councilmember month Mosqueda was concerned about is the choices.,110,,
501,0.97,5072.801,5073.968,Which are we leaning toward?,110,,
502,0.97,5073.968,5079.107,I can't tell you that.,110,,
503,0.97,5079.107,5082.31,So thank you.,110,,
504,0.97,5082.31,5085.38,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",111,,
505,0.97,5085.38,5087.816,"I really, really appreciate this conversation.",112,,
506,0.97,5087.816,5096.591,"I want to state back what I think I hear you reporting out, Councilmember Juarez.",112,,
507,0.97,5096.591,5156.651,"What we have learned from sound transit is the board's options for addressing the remaining gaps includes delaying the delivery of projects to allow for longer periods for revenue collection to still be delivering the same projects and building in phases, and I do want to just daylight that January 7 Blog post, sound transit specifically said the board also retains the most extreme option which it has not yet discussed of extending or deleting project if necessary to realize the region's critical transit needs within the parameters in the Voter- approved plan.",112,,
508,0.97,5156.651,5171.499,But what I think I am hearing is the board has the extreme option it is as reported on the seventh of January it hadn't been Discussioned.,112,,
509,0.97,5171.499,5198.726,"That option had not been discuss Ed, and Councilmember Juarez, thank you for your role and Council President Gonzalez's role and Councilmember Lewis, and I want to loop back to the deal that was struck as it relates to the funding.",112,,
510,0.97,5198.726,5199.16,You are correct.,112,,
511,0.97,5199.16,5213.841,The city agreed to be limited to one grant in the middle of 2022 from the annual normal expected grant funding.,112,,
512,0.97,5213.841,5246.574,"Council President, if I may--I want to tighten up something that you brought up and Councilmember Herbold said when we were briefed by sound transit and they explained what the law allows us to do and can't do under the ballot measure, and when you talk about delay of project and deliver project and in phases and reduce the project or suspend and Delete, the fourth one, that's the most extreme.",113,,
513,0.97,5246.574,5253.982,It's not even that we are there yet and I will say it one more time again and then shut up.,113,,
514,0.97,5253.982,5264.259,"The realignment tools that we use, you know, I have to Reremember as well as the Mayor this is a Tricounty board.",113,,
515,0.97,5264.259,5268.096,"You know, it's--it's Snohomish, King, and Pierce.",113,,
516,0.97,5268.096,5268.396,And yes.,113,,
517,0.97,5268.396,5275.136,"We represent the city of Seattle, but ultimately serve on the regional board for all the interests.",113,,
518,0.97,5275.136,5279.707,"You can imagine the discussion, and I want to thank the Mayor.",113,,
519,0.97,5279.707,5293.054,Here and I often have to really kind of be straightforward with other cities about the needs for Seattle because it's a major economic engine for the state.,113,,
520,0.97,5293.054,5295.723,I am not saying it's the best sea.,113,,
521,0.97,5295.723,5305.867,I am saying sometimes it requires us to be candid and you need to step up a bit here because what is happening with the bridge conversation.,113,,
522,0.97,5305.867,5307.368,So don't worry.,113,,
523,0.97,5307.368,5309.337,I got you.,113,,
524,0.97,5309.337,5313.341,That's the best I can say.,113,,
525,0.97,5313.341,5316.978,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Juarez.",114,,
526,0.97,5316.978,5320.481,Any other comments or questions on the report?,114,,
527,0.97,5320.481,5334.796,I don't think Councilmember Juarez thought we would dig in this deeply to her report this morning but I appreciate the added conversation as it impacts the transportation network.,114,,
528,0.97,5334.796,5347.709,That is so significant in this creative time and I agree you with wholeheartedly we will regionally . on this and that is not always easy.,114,,
529,0.97,5347.709,5347.909,Okay.,114,,
530,0.97,5347.909,5350.978,"Hearing no other comments, we'll move down the line.",114,,
531,0.97,5350.978,5360.088,We are going to hear from Councilmember Lewis and then Councilmember Morales.,114,,
532,0.97,5360.088,5360.421,Good morning.,114,,
533,0.97,5360.421,5363.191,"Thank you, Council President.",115,,
534,0.97,5363.191,5385.213,There is nothing for the Committee on the homeless investment but a reminder that the committee has a meeting on the 20th with a hearing on bill 11975 that permits housing legislation.,115,,
535,0.97,5385.213,5396.124,There was no appeal file on the advocacy of Non-Significance for the analysis.,115,,
536,0.97,5396.124,5409.237,So we are able to proceed Procedurally at our own leisure and don't have to go through any appeals process as a prerequisite.,115,,
537,0.97,5409.237,5413.574,I appreciated getting that from the essential staff last week.,115,,
538,0.97,5413.574,5444.138,"I want to thank the recent advocacy and journalism on the proposal and letters of support that I believe were distributed from the housing consortium and favorable coverage from Ryan Packer and just this morning actually on the Urbanist, an article that was published.",115,,
539,0.97,5444.138,5453.047,So thanks to all those in the community following this propose a and I look forward to discussing it more.,115,,
540,0.97,5453.047,5467.295,This week I will be attending the board of health meeting on Thursday with my colleagues Councilmember Mosqueda and Morales.,115,,

542,0.97,5475.67,5519.514,"I want to give a brief shout out and call to action from our friends at Coleague, and I know the information was provided to Council on the efforts, not exclusively in my district but extensively in district seven but I know also in numerous neighborhoods in district two and District three on the initiative and the work that they have been doing which has been a bright shot in the pandemic as a collaboration of business improvement areas, serve providers, and community members.",115,,
543,0.97,5519.514,5535.096,The data shared with the Council today shows they are supporting 124 folks in hotel rooms and other service providers through the just care initiative.,115,,
544,0.97,5535.096,5543.771,"And these are folks who generally have very, very high barriers attached to traditional shelter and traditional housing.",115,,
545,0.97,5543.771,5567.228,"It's a Testament to the work that our partners are doing, working with very high barrier individuals in neighborhoods have about been experiencing large concentrations of people experiencing Meth addiction or behavioral mental health.",115,,
546,0.97,5567.228,5590.751,"And I am so profoundly proud of the work that these folks are doing to make happen, and this are 124 individuals which would otherwise be sleeping under bridges and in tents and in Culverts and this shows we can indeed come together and do something to serve the city.",115,,
547,0.97,5590.751,5596.624,And I raise this as a call to action.,115,,
548,0.97,5596.624,5601.562,"On January 31, just care will have the source of funding expire.",115,,

552,0.97,5651.579,5673.667,"I want to move on and just mention before closing out that I did have the privilege of joining thousands of my neighbors for the Seattle M well, K March that convened at Gar Garfield high school and marched to the city hall.",115,,

590,0.97,6056.15,6098.592,I will start with echoing with wishing the Congresswoman and her husband well and all those who called for accountability for the harmful Act and dangerous behavior especially of the Republicans who refuse to wear a mask let alone the danger and physical danger they were placed in due to the coup and insurrection that occurred on Wednesday the sixth and the dangerous acts within the rooms that they were confined and I appreciate the ongoing call for the accountability.,120,,
591,0.97,6098.592,6105.699,"And from our office, there are a few items.",120,,
592,0.97,6105.699,6113.707,"The referral calendar has 119990, an emergency and hazard pay ordinance for grocery workers.",120,,
593,0.97,6113.707,6126.52,This is the legislation I mentioned last week that I am excited to be working on in partnership with other cities across the West Coast considering similar legislation.,120,,
594,0.97,6126.52,6131.258,This is a really important piece of legislation.,120,,
595,0.97,6131.258,6177.271,"We continue to recognize skyrocketing rates of Covid in the Pacific Northwest and we are extremely pleased and applaud governor Inslee to make sure there are more vaccines available and are optimistic of having the new administration in the process of streamlining the vaccine, and it looks like it will not change in the near term especially for the frontline workers who are more likely took women and people of color and have experienced higher rates to Covid and they are no longer receiving hazard pay and have not been for quite a while.",120,,
596,0.97,6177.271,6189.616,But other cities are stepping in and acting and passing legislation to make sure they have access to hazard pay through the Covid crisis.,120,,
597,0.97,6189.616,6202.863,The legislation we have on the referral calendar declare an emergency for Covid- 19 and have businesses provide hazard pay.,120,,
598,0.97,6202.863,6238.865,"And it would compensate grocery employees for the risk of working on the Frontlines of this global pandemic, improve our financial ability to act with resources and stay safe and healthy and it encourages them to continue their work which we all rely on for access to essentials such as toilet paper and diapers and baby food and making sure that we have access supplies and staying healthy.",120,,
599,0.97,6238.865,6245.172,And the community depends on the grocery store employees for the critical services.,120,,
600,0.97,6245.172,6257.985,"During the development, I heard the opportunity to hear real life experiences from grocery store workers themselves who are doing everything they can to protect themselves.",120,,
601,0.97,6257.985,6276.87,"They are wearing their masks and are doing due diligence to stay clean and safe but the public comes in wearing masks under their nose or feel the heat walking by as they are near them, and we want them to be safe.",120,,
602,0.97,6276.87,6279.906,I heard a tragic story from a grocery worker.,120,,
603,0.97,6279.906,6290.517,She has children and she was making a decision about how to make sure to keep her children safe and continue to access her job.,120,,
604,0.97,6290.517,6299.459,"In order to make ends meet, she made an impossible decision to not lease her apartment and live in her car.",120,,
605,0.97,6299.459,6305.832,She knew she had to keep her job to make sure her kids had access to food.,120,,
606,0.97,6305.832,6335.595,Sheis driving from Seattle to Lakewood for child care and back to Seattle to do her job at a grocery store and driving back down and picking up her kids to live in the car because that's the decision that people are making when they are living paycheck to paycheck and worrying about their Kiddos not having access to child care and keeping their job to provide for their family.,120,,
607,0.97,6335.595,6339.633,This is an impossible decision no one should be making.,120,,
608,0.97,6339.633,6351.511,Allowing for hazard pay helps families not have to make the decision been a roof over their head in an apartment and keep their job.,120,,
609,0.97,6351.511,6355.882,So these are stories of the frontline.,120,,
610,0.97,6355.882,6366.426,We call them heroes or essential workers but we should make sure they are not forced to sacrifice health and well being.,120,,
611,0.97,6366.426,6368.595,They are not sacrificial workers.,120,,
612,0.97,6368.595,6408.335,"And for context, the city of Los Angeles is considering this type of legislation on January 6 with a possible vote on February 9. and Montebello, January 27 are considering, and Oakland and San Jose are considering this the first week of February and they are acting as quickly as they can, and they realize that the crisis of Covid is not done and are looking to pay the essential workers $4 more, and one city, $5.",120,,
613,0.97,6408.335,6420.28,And we look forward to talking with you all and making sure those on the forefront of keeping us healthy can keep themselves and their families healthy.,120,,
614,0.97,6420.28,6422.949,"If you have any questions, let us know.",120,,
615,0.97,6422.949,6429.656,The chief of staff has been working on this and I thank the essential staff as well.,120,,
616,0.97,6429.656,6440.667,It will be on the housing and Finance Committee on this Friday.,120,,
617,0.97,6440.667,6455.015,We have several meetings for the labor advisory board and housing authority and let's see also the community housing public development on the agenda for Friday.,120,,
618,0.97,6455.015,6460.086,We have one item on the full council agenda.,120,,
619,0.97,6460.086,6483.877,"I will be bringing forward resolution 31983 that CONFIRMS our desire for elected officials in the local area and state and national levels to work with those who are in Cuba, other elected officials and work with the international community to exchange information relate the to Covid- 19.",120,,
620,0.97,6483.877,6499.392,"I went into detail with this last week on the full calendar and briefly as you know, the medical system and health information system have a long history of strength.",120,,
621,0.97,6499.392,6507.167,"I hope for your support this afternoon and look forward to sharing your comments, and we will bring an amended version forward.",120,,
622,0.97,6507.167,6528.955,"You should have received that this morning, and thank you for your work on that, and thank you very much to our friends from the office of Intergovernmental relations and Councilmember Herbold for the language included to account for the current state of Cuba and the United States.",120,,
623,0.97,6528.955,6538.965,"And I want to just note that again, our housing and Finance Committee will be meeting this Friday instead of today, obviously.",120,,
624,0.97,6538.965,6542.035,We moved that overdue to the holiday.,120,,
625,0.97,6542.035,6547.173,And the briefing on January 22nd at 2:00 P.M.,120,,
626,0.97,6547.173,6574.501,"We will have the reappointment to the Seattle housing authority and then we also have four appointments to the advisory committee, and so we have the agenda that will be published very soon.",120,,
627,0.97,6574.501,6578.572,I want to thank folks for their continued surface.,120,,
628,0.97,6578.572,6586.546,"A short presentation from the Seattle housing authority, and Lastly, the hazard pay legislation which I described for you.",120,,
629,0.97,6586.546,6591.618,"Council President, that is all for me today.",120,,
630,0.97,6591.618,6593.753,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",121,,
631,0.97,6593.753,6599.693,Any comments or questions on that report?,121,,
632,0.97,6599.693,6609.636,"Hearing none we'll go ahead down the line and next up, Councilmember Pedersen.",121,,
633,0.97,6609.636,6610.036,Good morning.,121,,
634,0.97,6610.036,6612.372,"Good morning, Council President.",122,,
635,0.97,6612.372,6616.576,We have no items on the full agenda.,122,,
636,0.97,6616.576,6619.212,"Our committee meets tomorrow, Wednesday, January 20 at 2:00 P.M.",122,,
637,0.97,6619.212,6627.52,Normally we meet in the morning but we moved it in the afternoon to witness the inauguration of President Biden and vice president Harris earlier that day.,122,,
638,0.97,6627.52,6640.133,As you can see on the public agenda for the committee we have more appointments for various advisory boards and briefings on technology items.,122,,
639,0.97,6640.133,6652.812,I am very thankful for Council President Morales and Councilmember Juarez for restoring funding for the West Seattle bridge.,122,,
640,0.97,6652.812,6663.657,I attend the North police precinct advisory committee and enabled the captain to answer questions about the disturbing increase in burglaries throughout the North precinct.,122,,
641,0.97,6663.657,6671.798,They are up 34 percent which you compare 2020 to 2019 according to SPD's crime dashboard.,122,,
642,0.97,6671.798,6687.414,This helps to gather and provide information and feedback in the largest geographical area covered by the police Department.,122,,
643,0.97,6687.414,6692.986,I participated yesterday in a peaceful March with the Mlk coalition.,122,,
644,0.97,6692.986,6698.158,It started at Garfield high school and ended up at the King County administration building.,122,,
645,0.97,6698.158,6714.34,It was great to hear from Larry Gossett recounting the story of how King County's name was properly changed to represent Mlk junior.,122,,
646,0.97,6714.34,6723.016,"Having participated in marches like this decades ago as a student, it's discouraging to see how far we need to go as a nation.",122,,
647,0.97,6723.016,6735.428,I believe yesterday's March in solidarity in the tumultuous times Seened to strengthen everyone's resolve.,122,,
648,0.97,6735.428,6758.284,"And I look forward to working on the committee for the marginalized Committee, and over zoom this afternoon, it was mentioned there was an increase to participate in state Attorney General Ferguson's forum to protect our national archives.",122,,
649,0.97,6758.284,6774.2,We must not allow the last G Asp of the Trump administration to cause any more harm and we must work to save the archives by preserving the priceless historical documents from the Northwest.,122,,
650,0.97,6774.2,6776.402,That's all for my report.,122,,
651,0.97,6776.402,6780.373,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen, for the report.",123,,
652,0.97,6780.373,6783.777,Any comments or questions.,123,,
653,0.97,6783.777,6790.116,Hearing none we'll going to Councilmember Sawant.,123,,
654,0.97,6790.116,6790.45,Good morning.,123,,
655,0.97,6790.45,6792.118,Good morning.,124,,
656,0.97,6792.118,6806.633,And I also want to convey my best wishes to the Congresswoman and her family as they recover from Covid.,124,,
657,0.97,6806.633,6817.877,It's appalling that they contracted Covid because the Republicans refused to wear masks.,124,,
658,0.97,6817.877,6823.116,As if the dangerous actions from the far right is not horrific enough.,124,,
659,0.97,6823.116,6828.721,"And we heard on Twitter, Tweets from the Seattle E.R.",124,,
660,0.97,6828.721,6835.361,Nurse over the weekend who said that when Seattle police officers came to the E.R.,124,,
661,0.97,6835.361,6853.279,", she obtained a statement from an assault patient and reporting from the Tweet, one officer brazenly refused to put a mask on in the hallway and Tere were Covid-Positive patients in the nearby rooms and multiple nurses happened him masked.",124,,
662,0.97,6853.279,6864.824,"When asked if there was a problem, the office put his demand my face and said, Miss, I am here to my job.",124,,
663,0.97,6864.824,6870.396,"If we need a conversation about a mask, we can have that later.",124,,
664,0.97,6870.396,6872.565,"And I said, there was no conversation needed.",124,,
665,0.97,6872.565,6875.735,I need to you wear a mask.,124,,
666,0.97,6875.735,6886.346,"I escalated to my charge nurse and he acted Condescendingly to her, too.",124,,
667,0.97,6886.346,6891.251,"And it was escalated to the manager, and he did put on the mask.",124,,
668,0.97,6891.251,6898.324,"And there were other officers staying there, none of them saying, Hey, man, you should put a mask on.",124,,
669,0.97,6898.324,6901.327,And that was the end of the Tweet.,124,,
670,0.97,6901.327,6916.209,"The Seattle police Department said they should file a complaint, and obviously, as a lot of others responded on Twitter, there is no hope that OPA will hold the officers to account.",124,,
671,0.97,6916.209,6925.952,But I want to convey publically my appreciation to the E.R.,124,,
672,0.97,6925.952,6931.457,Information publically so the members of the public can be informed.,124,,
673,0.97,6931.457,6939.232,There are no items from the Sustainability and Renters accountability.,124,,
674,0.97,6939.232,6948.975,The next meeting is January 26 when we discuss and possibly vote on extending the moratorium to the end of this year as so many people have demanded.,124,,
675,0.97,6948.975,6953.313,I will be sending that to your offices once the review is complete.,124,,
676,0.97,6953.313,6960.153,We will discuss the legislation for the right to Council for people in Seattle.,124,,
677,0.97,6960.153,6970.163,More than 2000 people signed a petition that was organized by my office in coalition with Renters' rights organization.,124,,
678,0.97,6970.163,6979.472,"Last month, it was called upon to renew the moratorium and extend it to the end of 2021.",124,,
679,0.97,6979.472,6993.319,"And undoubtedly, they succeeded in getting the extension but it was only for three months through the end of March.",124,,
680,0.97,6993.319,7018.845,"We know the Renter crisis will unleash a tidal wave going into the recovery as well, and nearly 12 million Renters will Ow E an average of $5,600 in back rent and utilities by next month.",124,,
681,0.97,7018.845,7027.653,"This was from Moody's ANALYTICS, and last month, nine million Renters said that they were behind on rent.",124,,
682,0.97,7027.653,7034.394,"And Obviously, this will be reflected in major metropolitan areas like Seattle.",124,,
683,0.97,7034.394,7045.772,"In Seattle, people with financial hardship in this emergency are protected by law that create defense for six months after the moratorium ends.",124,,
684,0.97,7045.772,7075.368,"Working with the rank and file Renters themselves who are becoming active, we'll discuss the bill for the Renters to have a six-month duration or at least until the end of the year so the Renters can have certainty at a time that is extremely stressful and traumatic.",124,,
685,0.97,7075.368,7093.219,We will have testimony without exaggeration about why extending it at least until the end of this year will relieve extreme anxiety.,124,,
686,0.97,7093.219,7098.958,We have 73 testimonials and we are soliciting the Renters to give their feedback.,124,,
687,0.97,7098.958,7107.3,I will read just one right now and this is from a homeowner and a small Lander from Evan in beacon Hill.,124,,
688,0.97,7107.3,7110.937,"Quote, I am a homeowner and landlord living in beacon Hill.",124,,
689,0.97,7110.937,7116.742,So many Renters are struggling due to Covid and cannot meet the demands of their rental agreement.,124,,
690,0.97,7116.742,7126.586,These people are struggling through no fault of their own and this only increases anxiety in the city.,124,,
691,0.97,7126.586,7139.465,If someone cannot afford rent how can they afford a new place to rent?,124,,
692,0.97,7139.465,7154.881,"Please extend the moratorium to product our most vulnerable citizens at this time, Unquote, and the billed will remove the requirements to submit an affidavit saying that they suffered financial hardship.",124,,
693,0.97,7154.881,7163.956,"Removing this is, of course, to remove financial hardship.",124,,
694,0.97,7163.956,7164.223,Why else?,124,,
695,0.97,7164.223,7172.098,"It hits low income and working across people and especially African-American women, head of household, the hardest.",124,,
696,0.97,7172.098,7187.346,And know that the paperwork requirements keeps people from Accessing the benefits that are intended for them.,124,,
697,0.97,7187.346,7191.884,This ends up hitting the most destitute the hardest.,124,,
698,0.97,7191.884,7203.629,"This is particularly important in conjunction with the other legislation we will discuss, guaranteeing the right to counsel for anyone facing Eviction.",124,,
699,0.97,7203.629,7214.073,And the people's movement will be Majorly expanded which we started fighting for and funding in previous years' budgets which has been essential.,124,,
700,0.97,7214.073,7219.946,"It's unclear if official funding will be needed and if so, how much will be needed in 2021.",124,,
701,0.97,7219.946,7225.551,We are trying to assess that.,124,,
702,0.97,7225.551,7230.356,It's unknown if the Mayor and governor will extend the moratorium.,124,,
703,0.97,7230.356,7243.936,This would give you an attorney in court regardless of ability to pay just like you have the right to an attorney which you are accused of a crime.,124,,
704,0.97,7243.936,7255.381,This makes should clear that you have attorney to represent the people.,124,,
705,0.97,7255.381,7265.124,The housing project has sent my office data showing the Evictions that occur by default are a massive problem.,124,,
706,0.97,7265.124,7276.602,"Anywhere from 30 percent to a shocking 25 percent of Representers with Eviction notices end up experiencing Eviction by default, depending on the region and the time.",124,,
707,0.97,7276.602,7280.573,We have heard horror stories that is unbelievable.,124,,
708,0.97,7280.573,7325.851,"And literally, people in comas which they got Eviction notices, and people who have not had the ability to pay attention to the mail because they have faced challenges because of their health, and the Renters themselves will be in committee to share this testimony themselves, and we strongly believe with the housing authority that removing this requirement is essential because it will allow the public defense attorneys to come to the defense of people who are not capable for whatever reason to appear in court and defend themselves.",124,,
709,0.97,7325.851,7326.285,Thank you.,124,,
710,0.97,7326.285,7330.556,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant for that report.",125,,
711,0.97,7330.556,7335.161,Are there any comments or questions?,125,,
712,0.97,7335.161,7335.661,All right.,125,,
713,0.97,7335.661,7341.0,"Hearing none, let's go ahead and Councilmember Herbold, please.",125,,
714,0.97,7341.0,7342.034,Sorry for the delay.,126,,
715,0.97,7342.034,7355.381,"I want to highlight as it relates specifically to the mask wearing question, thank you, Councilmember Sawant for raising this and, of course, thank you to the E.R.",126,,
716,0.97,7355.381,7363.689,Nurse over the weekend who Daylighted the concern.,126,,
717,0.97,7363.689,7380.84,"This is not a new concern with examples of individual officers not wearing masks, and as was reported, there was no encouragement from the officers' colleagues to do so.",126,,
718,0.97,7380.84,7419.044,"I want to mention that although the statement coming out of the police Department we can focus on the means to file a complete, and I have asked whether or not there is another approach that does not rely on an OPA complaint and get a resolution to the issue, particularly what is most important is corrected action.",126,,
719,0.97,7419.044,7424.483,"And over the summer, it was written--we were receiving these kind of complaints.",126,,
720,0.97,7424.483,7432.825,It was written that the police Department is actually aware of the science showing the important role masks can play.,126,,
721,0.97,7432.825,7438.33,I have directed all employees to adhere to the public health order.,126,,
722,0.97,7438.33,7452.511,"In each instance when the employee is known not to have a mask on, that employee's supervisor and chain of command will be directed to address the lack of compliance.",126,,
723,0.97,7452.511,7483.709,A subtle but I think substantive difference in what we heard from the chief from what we read in the stage over the weekend in that it sounds to me that the chief was making a commitment to work and try and address the issues through the chain of command absence an OPA investigation and sustained funding.,126,,
724,0.97,7483.709,7492.218,So I reached out to find out from him whether or not there is that method as well.,126,,
725,0.97,7492.218,7512.204,"I--I don't understand think that when dealing with a public health emergency in a pandemic, we should have to wait for the completion of an OPA investigation when the OPA is investigating hundreds of complaints right now.",126,,
726,0.97,7512.204,7531.69,We should have to wait for the completion of such an investigation in order to get corrected action and corrected action means safe workplace and public service and engagement of public health practices as required by the state of Washington.,126,,
727,0.97,7531.69,7537.062,I'll let folks know what I find out in that area.,126,,
728,0.97,7537.062,7540.933,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",127,,
729,0.97,7540.933,7546.872,Any other comments or questions?,127,,
