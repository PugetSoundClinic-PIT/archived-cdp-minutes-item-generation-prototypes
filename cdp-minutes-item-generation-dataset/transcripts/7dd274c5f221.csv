22,0.97,47.113,47.981,"Thank you, Ted.",14,,
23,0.97,47.981,52.652,And thank you to all the members of the committee who are here this morning.,14,,
24,0.97,52.652,58.258,We have three items on today's agenda on Renters' rights.,14,,
25,0.97,58.258,66.533,"On our last committee meeting, we heard from situations where landlords violated.",14,,
26,0.97,66.533,69.869,"In today's committee meeting, we hope to continue that discussion.",14,,
27,0.97,69.869,80.713,"First, the Seattle Department of discussions, commonly referred to will present about how they investigate and enforce members' rights.",14,,
28,0.97,80.713,86.786,And enforce what rights they have when a Renter calls their Hotline.,14,,
29,0.97,86.786,91.024,Hearing about their experiences when their rights were violated.,14,,
30,0.97,91.024,93.393,And their attempts to get Redressal.,14,,
31,0.97,93.393,103.87,"My office is regularly contacted by Renters, who vehicle their rights violated.",14,,
32,0.97,103.87,112.078,Sometimes their landlords are doing things that are illegal and sometimes not illegal but ridiculously high rent increases.,14,,
33,0.97,112.078,126.459,"By working with Renters over the years and discussing the city's enforcement procedures with the experts at the housing justice project, and at the SD Ci, my office is gathering examples where the procedures need to improve.",14,,
34,0.97,126.459,132.999,"We need to develop legislation out of these committee meetings, to overhaul how Renters' rights are enforced.",14,,
35,0.97,132.999,149.115,"I want to be clear when Renters E-mail my office to report abuses, we often give them information about how to do the SD Ci.",14,,
36,0.97,149.115,150.049,Sometimes we directly contact landlords.,14,,
37,0.97,150.049,153.987,"And many times, we are able to help Renters solve their problem.",14,,
38,0.97,153.987,155.054,"However, just the magnitude.",14,,
39,0.97,155.054,162.562,The number of instances where Renters have problems far outweigh what we're able to do in this method.,14,,
40,0.97,162.562,167.233,So the point of discussion is not to say that Renters can never get justice because that is not true.,14,,
41,0.97,167.233,175.241,"The part of the discussion is to find loopholes and to close them, recognizing the fact that the problem is very widespread and prevalent.",14,,
42,0.97,175.241,180.48,It's not just--it's not an unusual thing or a handful of Renters that face these problems.,14,,
43,0.97,180.48,181.748,It's all over the city.,14,,
44,0.97,181.748,189.122,I wanted to give a few examples of the problems we have found in Seattle's enforcement of Renters' rights.,14,,
45,0.97,189.122,201.2,"My office has aren't Renters without heat, mold, Pestses.",14,,
46,0.97,201.2,203.102,Those are not secure.,14,,
47,0.97,203.102,215.281,And so many are unacceptable housing conditions that are also legal violations of Seattle's housing codes.,14,,
48,0.97,215.281,219.252,Seattle's Rentam code ordinance allows to be inspected.,14,,
49,0.97,219.252,226.092,They are sometimes willing to sign on things we've seen.,14,,
50,0.97,226.092,230.196,"If a Residenter calls, often a city Inspector will visit the property.",14,,
51,0.97,230.196,235.335,"The city Inspector is responsible and do a serious inspection, once they come to the property.",14,,
52,0.97,235.335,239.439,"However that, can only come after a Renter calls the complaint line.",14,,
53,0.97,239.439,246.446,"And most do not know, they're not even aware that they have this option of calling the Sdci and lodging a complaint.",14,,
54,0.97,246.446,254.587,"When Renters do call, it is when we are truly, and this is Wawe've observed in most of the instances.",14,,
55,0.97,254.587,258.691,It is when they are truly at their wits' end.,14,,
56,0.97,258.691,263.029,And they have someone like the tenant's Union.,14,,
57,0.97,263.029,266.699,Or the staffing and let them know they have this option.,14,,
58,0.97,266.699,269.068,Renters have many reasons to report fear and violation.,14,,
59,0.97,269.068,272.005,Because there is no rent control in Washington state.,14,,
60,0.97,272.005,279.846,"Renters worry if they ask their landlord for request, that could motivate the landlord to raise the rent.",14,,
61,0.97,279.846,287.02,That is a commonly feared intimidation or retaliation that Renters have reported to us.,14,,
62,0.97,287.02,292.558,"Whether it's true or not, it is something that every Renter I've spoken to thinks about.",14,,
63,0.97,292.558,298.798,"And you know, whether it happens in a given case or not, it is something that Renters fear.",14,,
64,0.97,298.798,306.973,And the reason they fear is it happens often.,14,,
65,0.97,306.973,317.45,"My office saw a woman whose bathroom was so dilapidated, she installed a new shower herself.",14,,
66,0.97,317.45,324.223,"When the landlord saw the improvement, they raised the rent because they thought they could get more.",14,,
67,0.97,324.223,330.863,The landlord is required to make repairs in a reasonable time line or face possible fines.,14,,
68,0.97,330.863,341.341,But that clock to complete repairs does not start when the problem off guard or even when the Renter first called the landlord about the problem.,14,,
69,0.97,341.341,345.311,It only starts as DCI inspectors visit the property.,14,,
70,0.97,345.311,349.315,"Renters who have been, for example, no heat for months, prior to the inspection.",14,,
71,0.97,349.315,350.249,Get no justice for that time.,14,,
72,0.97,350.249,354.353,They still have to pay the full rent for all that time.,14,,
73,0.97,354.353,364.964,"Even when a landlord fails to complete the repairs in the time required by Sdci, they are not necessarily fined.",14,,
74,0.97,364.964,366.432,In order to do it.,14,,
75,0.97,366.432,368.868,They must send it to the city attorney's office.,14,,
76,0.97,368.868,383.816,"And when a judgment for the fines in practice, this means that Sdci and the city attorney's office, give a lot of extra chances for landlords to complete repairs before completing electing fines.",14,,
77,0.97,383.816,386.152,"City wide, Sdci issued five fines.",14,,
78,0.97,386.152,389.989,Only five fines to landlords in all of 2021 combined.,14,,
79,0.97,389.989,398.798,This is yet another example of how the rich and powerful in our society are being held to a completely different standard by the legal system.,14,,
80,0.97,398.798,413.679,"Even when the city does levy a fine, nowhere in Seattle's law, is the Renter compensated for the rent they ended up paying, during the time when those inadequate or dilapidated conditions persisted.",14,,
81,0.97,413.679,418.718,"In my experience, the staff will work at Sdci, dedicated to their work.",14,,
82,0.97,418.718,424.09,But the structure of the system is totally stacked against Renters.,14,,
83,0.97,424.09,433.9,"One example that Sdci brought to my attention is the enforcement of the law, prohibiting landlords from entering a rental apartment.",14,,
84,0.97,433.9,435.435,Unless there is an emergency.,14,,
85,0.97,435.435,446.179,"Under Seattle emergency, if a landlord breaks the law, they are issued a notice of violation that essentially says, they have to correct the problem, which is accomplished, the moment they leave the apartment.",14,,
86,0.97,446.179,446.446,You know.,14,,
87,0.97,446.446,449.081,Because the problem is them entering the problem without notice.,14,,
88,0.97,449.081,452.518,"If they do it again, they get another notice.",14,,
89,0.97,452.518,461.661,"In order to actually get a penalty, the landlord would need to enter the apartment.",14,,
90,0.97,461.661,463.596,They remain there for days longer.,14,,
91,0.97,463.596,471.037,"I mean, this is just an example of how Renters face problems almost at an absurd level.",14,,
92,0.97,471.037,478.11,All of these problems are the result of the terrible power Embalance between Renters and their landlords.,14,,
93,0.97,478.11,485.451,"And we will hear specific examples, when we get to agenda item 2. where we have Renters and Renter advocates speaking to us.",14,,
94,0.97,485.451,497.063,"Our third and final agenda item today is a briefing on a bill, sponsored by Councilmember Pedersen that I support which adds information to the amount of rent charged to the Dataa.",14,,
95,0.97,497.063,502.768,"Landlords are required to disclose, as part of the city's rental registration and ordinance.",14,,
96,0.97,502.768,507.573,I believe this data will be helpful to demonstrate how rents are rising out of control.,14,,
97,0.97,507.573,509.442,And the need for rent control.,14,,
98,0.97,509.442,514.68,It is listed on today's agenda as a briefing or possible vote.,14,,
99,0.97,514.68,516.482,But I need to clarify.,14,,
100,0.97,516.482,517.216,This is an initial briefing.,14,,
101,0.97,517.216,521.52,And it will probably come to a vote at our next meeting.,14,,
102,0.97,521.52,526.959,"But I just want to reiterate, I support this legislation, from Councilmember Pedersen.",14,,
103,0.97,526.959,533.165,"Before we begin the public items, we have public comment.",14,,
104,0.97,533.165,550.383,"We have, we have, 41 people signed up, not all of them are present, showing as present, but we will make sure that we call on every Speaker and make sure that they are turning off their mute button and so on and so forth.",14,,
105,0.97,550.383,552.418,I will read out the names.,14,,
106,0.97,552.418,555.388,"When I call your name, you will be prompted to Unmute yourself.",14,,
107,0.97,555.388,560.893,"And when you hear that, please hit Star 6 on your phone to Unmute yourself and begin.",14,,
108,0.97,560.893,568.668,"And because there are so many speakers signed up, we will have one minute for each person to speak.",14,,
109,0.97,568.668,571.938,So I will call three names in a row.,14,,
110,0.97,571.938,574.34,"And so please, you know, please be ready.",14,,
111,0.97,574.34,579.111,If you know that your name is coming up.,14,,
112,0.97,579.111,584.951,So our first three speakers are Madeleine Yin.,14,,
113,0.97,584.951,585.484,"First Speaker, Madeline.",14,,

116,0.97,587.453,589.155,My name is Marilyn Yirn.,15,,
117,0.97,589.155,591.49,And I'm a housing provider in D6.,15,,
118,0.97,591.49,598.798,I'd like the committee to ask yourself some due diligence questions before proceeding into policymaking.,15,,
119,0.97,598.798,603.336,Which key Stakeholders are not informed or invited to give information in context at this meeting?,15,,
120,0.97,603.336,607.173,What is the other side of the story that is not being told?,15,,
121,0.97,607.173,612.311,How might that additional context change the situation and how we approach it?,15,,
122,0.97,612.311,613.379,Why were they excluded today?,15,,
123,0.97,613.379,617.817,Is the city taking a balanced approach to all housing providers?,15,,
124,0.97,617.817,621.287,What is the portion of code violations in each of these sectors?,15,,
125,0.97,621.287,626.625,Remember that the city has lost 10% of housing registrations in just the last eight months.,15,,
126,0.97,626.625,631.897,This should be a massive Wake- up call to city policy.,15,,
127,0.97,631.897,632.832,Encouraging and adding more.,15,,
128,0.97,632.832,647.413,"What is the collateral damage of a heavy handed, punitive relationship to the city's ability to continue using rental housing, particularly for small mom and pop housing providers.",15,,
129,0.97,647.413,653.686,"I would ask that we move these issues to the housing committee or somewhere else, to get a complete picture and have better resulting policy.",15,,
130,0.97,653.686,657.657,Thank you.,15,,
131,0.97,657.657,661.06,Our next speakers are Angie Gerald and Cory brewer.,16,,
132,0.97,661.06,663.729,"And then after that, Brian Clooney.",16,,

134,0.97,675.408,682.081,"Also just wanted to let the approximately comment speakers Knowux when you hear that Ding, it means have you 10 seconds left.",16,,

143,0.97,696.962,717.95,"At recent meetings, the committee chair and panel speakers have said derogatory misleading things about small housing providers who made authentic public comments, call being the corporate, referring to publicly confirmed issues as false narratives and saying that landlords are unfamiliar with how Eviction works.",17,,
144,0.97,717.95,723.556,Slide commentary should not be allowed to during civic meetings.,17,,
145,0.97,723.556,728.828,"This Shtalk to, not mock or exclude or Storeio type.",17,,

148,0.97,742.608,746.745,"City is hemorrhaging, small locally owned rental properties.",17,,
149,0.97,746.745,752.084,Nonprofits and government agencies do not unfold the same for small-scale rental owners.,17,,
150,0.97,752.084,759.492,"Regarding the fire damaged building damage on today's agenda, I propose the city require Renters insurance.",17,,

155,0.97,776.108,782.181,High priority with my clients and the same goes for most housing providers.,19,,
156,0.97,782.181,784.25,But there's a Disconnect here.,19,,
157,0.97,784.25,785.284,We're talking about maintenance violations.,19,,
158,0.97,785.284,794.693,"But this conversation comes at a time, when we've had a Two- year moratorium on rent payments, in addition to public calls for rent strikes and Rentsd control.",19,,
159,0.97,794.693,799.498,Operating income is necessary in order to invest in upkeep.,19,,
160,0.97,799.498,801.133,It's very simple math.,19,,
161,0.97,801.133,806.272,I just wish that the committee chair would take a more collaborative approach to discussing these issues.,19,,
162,0.97,806.272,813.179,"And on that note, to Councilmember Pedersen, thank you for your willingness to collaborate and listen to various points of view.",19,,
163,0.97,813.179,815.614,I also think that data is important.,19,,
164,0.97,815.614,817.783,But I think your approach needs a lot of work.,19,,
165,0.97,817.783,821.02,And we are more than happy to discuss that with you further.,19,,

372,0.97,1699.998,1707.872,"It's odd to hear them complain about advocates, misrepresenting their position or throwing derogatory terms.",50,,

374,0.97,1713.311,1715.88,Complaints about extra burdens being placed on landlords.,50,,
375,0.97,1715.88,1721.72,What about the burden of exploding rent on Renters who cannot afford to stay in their homes anymore.,50,,
376,0.97,1721.72,1726.791,What about the tsunami of Renters getting kicked out of their homes.,50,,
377,0.97,1726.791,1729.694,The power balance is fundamentally uneven.,50,,
378,0.97,1729.694,1738.403,"Tenants are not as aware of legal options, how to exercise them or afraid to exercise them for fear of retaliation, which will make them lose their home.",50,,
379,0.97,1738.403,1743.108,Not just some income on investments as the case of a landlord.,50,,
380,0.97,1743.108,1748.98,Manifest in the fact that all of last year Wrapid malpractice.,50,,
381,0.97,1748.98,1751.95,Only five landlords got fined last year for violation.,50,,

385,0.97,1769.834,1773.271,I'm a tenant and landlord for about the last 10 years.,52,,
386,0.97,1773.271,1777.242,And I also oversee the rentals for my immediate family members.,52,,
387,0.97,1777.242,1782.413,So I have a bird's eye into the way this policy affects just about everybody in this thing.,52,,
388,0.97,1782.413,1793.691,"And I think that everybody, all of the landlords who are above board and are operating properly, everybody, we all want the same thing, safe, healthy, stable housing stock.",52,,
389,0.97,1793.691,1801.633,And the issue we have here is that we are approaching it with a path that is taking us away from that goal.,52,,
390,0.97,1801.633,1806.704,The city needs to be encouraging the creation of new housing units.,52,,

392,0.97,1809.841,1814.145,The bad landlords and the good ones.,52,,
393,0.97,1814.145,1823.922,Why would anybody develop a new accessory dwelling or Mother-In- law apartment in their moment home if they're going to be faced with an onslaught of restrictions on their property.,52,,
394,0.97,1823.922,1824.255,They won't.,52,,
395,0.97,1824.255,1827.692,That's why we are beginning to sell our Seattle properties.,52,,
396,0.97,1827.692,1830.862,Those will never go back on the rental market.,52,,
397,0.97,1830.862,1832.697,Let's get collaborative.,52,,
398,0.97,1832.697,1834.532,We have the same general objectives.,52,,

567,0.97,2572.736,2574.238,Because they're afraid.,79,,
568,0.97,2574.238,2575.306,And I've called the city.,79,,
569,0.97,2575.306,2581.312,And I'm ready to go to the media because it's ridiculous.,79,,
570,0.97,2581.312,2583.113,And something needs to be done.,79,,
571,0.97,2583.113,2587.217,And some attention needs to be put on them.,79,,

585,0.97,2636.133,2637.801,But repeated Harassment from landlords.,81,,
586,0.97,2637.801,2641.805,Many of my neighbors have waited a year for repairs and are still wait being.,81,,
587,0.97,2641.805,2648.345,"The treatments that I have faced and my neighbors have faced, have been demeaning and unacceptable.",81,,
588,0.97,2648.345,2662.359,"And I strongly believe that landlords need to be held accountable, when they violate a Renter's rights, and we really need stronger enforcement from the city to make sure those landlords are held accountable.",81,,

598,0.97,2702.332,2706.336,So all of this complaining that this is too difficult for them is completely made up.,83,,
599,0.97,2706.336,2708.939,Another thing that concerns me a lot.,83,,
600,0.97,2708.939,2715.045,Is illegal clauses in leases.,83,,
601,0.97,2715.045,2716.38,And Severability Klauss in leases.,83,,
602,0.97,2716.38,2719.049,They think they should be banned.,83,,
603,0.97,2719.049,2726.323,Because they actually force tenants to abide by illegal Klauss.,83,,
604,0.97,2726.323,2734.131,The tenant has their resources to fight that.,83,,
605,0.97,2734.131,2741.739,Went into my bank account quite to get my rent.,83,,

613,0.97,2769.8,2773.504,And then I see somebody that is just a misnamed caller.,85,,
614,0.97,2773.504,2775.305,So I don't know who that would be.,85,,
615,0.97,2775.305,2776.106,I apologize.,85,,

624,0.97,2806.837,2812.209,I've had mold in my bathroom for two years in a brand new building.,87,,
625,0.97,2812.209,2813.944,It took them almost two years to fix it.,87,,
626,0.97,2813.944,2820.017,They didn't fix it until like two weeks ago.,87,,
627,0.97,2820.017,2822.586,And the ceiling was peeling.,87,,
628,0.97,2822.586,2825.756,"And also, they only fixed it a few weeks ago.",87,,
629,0.97,2825.756,2829.193,And my unit was also a new building.,87,,
630,0.97,2829.193,2832.429,My heater went out for eight months.,87,,
631,0.97,2832.429,2836.2,And I had to go buy one.,87,,
632,0.97,2836.2,2839.036,From rose to keep heat in my building.,87,,
633,0.97,2839.036,2841.738,And they just fixed that recently.,87,,
634,0.97,2841.738,2848.178,They just haven't enough to ensure Spacewide environment for us seniors.,87,,
635,0.97,2848.178,2851.381,Because some of the residents that moved in are not doing lawful things.,87,,
636,0.97,2851.381,2856.587,I believe--[inaudible],87,,
637,0.97,2856.587,2856.853,Next.,88,,

645,0.97,2875.572,2879.61,"And for sure, correspondent landlords are going to pass this on to Renters.",89,,
646,0.97,2879.61,2881.979,And I'm afraid some small Bltionzs will have to as well.,89,,
647,0.97,2881.979,2893.19,"I say, if you look at yourself as being in the business of providing homes and there is paperwork and hazard work involved, you also have to be prepared to take a loss.",89,,
648,0.97,2893.19,2898.328,And there's been plenty of money to help with the loss during the pandemic.,89,,
649,0.97,2898.328,2901.031,The Renters have very few resources.,89,,
650,0.97,2901.031,2910.607,"Also, another thing is the interest Oflandlords being diametrically opposed.",89,,

652,0.97,2911.241,2915.579,Hard to swim in the sea of the large landlords who are making the majority of the money.,89,,

655,0.97,2925.656,2933.797,"So I say instead of paperwork, join with us to Collaborately build housing.",89,,
656,0.97,2933.797,2935.532,We have Diane Webster.,90,,

737,0.97,3310.473,3319.149,"I also mentioned briefly, the rental registration and inspection ordinance.",100,,
738,0.97,3319.149,3324.621,So that program requires rental housing providers to register with us.,100,,
739,0.97,3324.621,3327.557,And to be inspected.,100,,
740,0.97,3327.557,3331.227,Not frequently but at least once every 10 years.,100,,
741,0.97,3331.227,3338.535,Some of them are inspected at least once every five years.,100,,
742,0.97,3338.535,3342.272,Trao.,100,,
743,0.97,3342.272,3346.776,"Tenant relocation assistance ordinance, when tenants are displaced by development or change of use.",100,,
744,0.97,3346.776,3352.382,"They can be eligible, if they're very low income for relocation assistance.",100,,
745,0.97,3352.382,3360.857,And then the new ordinance that Council passed last fall on economic displacement and relocation assistance.,100,,
746,0.97,3360.857,3363.86,"So, Jeff, if you move the slide.",100,,
747,0.97,3363.86,3367.33,"As I said, we have these two major programs.",100,,
748,0.97,3367.33,3372.569,And I've described quite a lot of the rental housing side of things.,100,,
749,0.97,3372.569,3386.516,That is the side of our program that administers grants to some of the tenant services organizations that we actually heard from today.,100,,
750,0.97,3386.516,3392.589,"Our Website, renting in Seattle.",100,,
751,0.97,3392.589,3396.459,And our several other tenant assistance programs.,100,,
752,0.97,3396.459,3402.999,"On Michelle's side of the program, housing inspections is a major focus of our group.",100,,
753,0.97,3402.999,3412.108,But her program is also the one that does all the Land-Use code inspections and shoreline code enforcement.,100,,
754,0.97,3412.108,3414.477,We enforce for construction without permits.,100,,
755,0.97,3414.477,3417.38,We run the vacant buildings programs.,100,,
756,0.97,3417.38,3423.019,We work on tree protection and enforcement.,100,,
757,0.97,3423.019,3425.555,And then weeds and vegetation enforcement.,100,,
758,0.97,3425.555,3430.226,So lots going on in Michele's division.,100,,
759,0.97,3430.226,3439.302,"I'm going to turn it over to Jeff, who will talk a little bit about how do tenants access our program.",100,,
760,0.97,3439.302,3440.97,How do they find out about us?,100,,
761,0.97,3440.97,3450.98,And what are we seeing with the a way tenants access our compliance and enforcement programs.,100,,
762,0.97,3450.98,3451.314,All right.,101,,
763,0.97,3451.314,3472.268,"Thank you, faith . Compliances community aware that their rights and responsibilities and services to help.",101,,
764,0.97,3472.268,3476.739,It is an important part of our work that we have built up over the last few years.,101,,
765,0.97,3476.739,3482.412,We have an extensive outreach program that includes our web portal.,101,,
766,0.97,3482.412,3492.856,That contains a lot of information about rights and best practices for Renters and tips for landlords.,101,,
767,0.97,3492.856,3493.99,We have our two phone lines.,101,,
768,0.97,3493.99,3499.028,Renting in Seattle phone line.,101,,
769,0.97,3499.028,3506.636,206-684-5700 and both of those are staffed during business hours.,101,,
770,0.97,3506.636,3517.58,"That is the primary place where we taken questions, concerns, complaints, and then distribute them to the appropriate folks in our organization to follow up on.",101,,
771,0.97,3517.58,3525.688,We have Infographics and videos and those are available in up to 14 languages and then we do Trainings and community events.,101,,
772,0.97,3525.688,3526.489,Quite a bit more.,101,,
773,0.97,3526.489,3544.574,"Before the pandemic it got scaled back to more virtual training over the last couple of years, but we try to be out in the community and meeting with organizations to talk about rights, best practices for Renters, resources that are available.",101,,
774,0.97,3544.574,3546.175,"One of our main messages is, call us.",101,,
775,0.97,3546.175,3553.716,"If you are experiencing a problem, lease violation, potential lease issue, give us a call.",101,,
776,0.97,3553.716,3555.351,That is a good place to start.,101,,
777,0.97,3555.351,3564.193,We also have a grant program and thanks to Council for helping fund that over the years.,101,,
778,0.97,3564.193,3578.641,"Grants focus on education, organizing, and assistance and counseling to tenants, with a real emphasis on working with community partners that reach communities in Seattle that may not actually want to hear from the government.",101,,
779,0.97,3578.641,3586.416,Sdci or may not even know that we exist.,101,,
780,0.97,3586.416,3602.298,"So, we have been doing the outreach and either because of conditions in the city or because of outreach or expanding tenant protections, we are definitely seeing an increase in Landlord/Tenant related calls.",101,,
781,0.97,3602.298,3605.702,We have two buckets there.,101,,
782,0.97,3605.702,3611.407,"Housing complaints, that is the term used for housing conditions, like a broken sink or the heat not working.",101,,
783,0.97,3611.407,3624.587,"Then we have Renter rights complaints that come to the Pota group and those are usually rent increases, lease questions, and such.",101,,
784,0.97,3624.587,3631.494,"You can see from 2017 up to 2021, we have had a steady increase in both of those.",101,,
785,0.97,3631.494,3640.87,Things are quite busy and so far 2020 two seems to be on track to be greater than that.,101,,
786,0.97,3640.87,3642.405,This is just a handful of common complaints.,101,,
787,0.97,3642.405,3645.942,Certainly not an exhaustive list.,101,,
788,0.97,3645.942,3653.249,"On the housing side, kitchens and bathrooms come up a lot, because there are so many things that can go wrong.",101,,
789,0.97,3653.249,3654.984,Leaky Faucets and moisture problems.,101,,
790,0.97,3654.984,3658.521,Ventilation problems.,101,,
791,0.97,3658.521,3662.992,"Pasts, rodents, bugs, Bedbugs keep coming up.",101,,
792,0.97,3662.992,3668.264,Security issues like locks and windows and then fire safety.,101,,
793,0.97,3668.264,3673.736,"Inoperable smoke detectors, Co detectors, are very common.",101,,
794,0.97,3673.736,3679.442,"On the rental housing side, the Landlord/Tenant issues, deposit returns, Eviction notices.",101,,
795,0.97,3679.442,3687.383,"As Councilmember Sawant mentioned, entry without proper notice, common issues that come up.",101,,
796,0.97,3687.383,3688.518,Especially in the last few months.,101,,
797,0.97,3688.518,3697.727,There were rent increases and the Eviction notices have been probably the most prevalent thing we are hearing right now.,101,,
798,0.97,3697.727,3700.763,"Looking at case resolution, this supports some slides that are coming up.",101,,
799,0.97,3700.763,3715.011,"You can see over the years, we have kind of a 50/50, 40/60 split.",101,,
800,0.97,3715.011,3720.883,This is all of the code compliance cases.,101,,
801,0.97,3720.883,3727.79,"We did not break this down just to Landlord/Tenant issues, so this includes other things we deal with like junk storage or vacant buildings.",101,,
802,0.97,3727.79,3733.029,"Overall, this 60/40 split, with a small percentage going to the lot apartment.",101,,
803,0.97,3733.029,3741.838,"As was mentioned before, pursuing findings in the lot apartment is slow and very Time- consuming for our staff to pursue.",101,,
804,0.97,3741.838,3767.196,"We are successful with the voluntary compliance, getting issues solved quickly, or using an forced compliance a little bit more stern approach, to getting issues resolved, before this progresses to working with the city attorney's office on a lawsuit.",101,,
805,0.97,3767.196,3768.831,"So, voluntary compliance is usually our goal.",101,,
806,0.97,3768.831,3773.503,That is how we kind of end.,101,,
807,0.97,3773.503,3774.837,"We look to do problem solving, first.",101,,
808,0.97,3774.837,3777.974,Because we find it resolves the issues faster.,101,,
809,0.97,3777.974,3785.715,It keeps tenants in their home and helps promote a better relationship with the landlords and tenants in the long run.,101,,
810,0.97,3785.715,3787.717,It efficiently uses our resources.,101,,
811,0.97,3787.717,3792.588,It is a lot faster to get an issue resolved quickly.,101,,
812,0.97,3792.588,3794.824,And our inspectors are perceived as having a more neutral role.,101,,
813,0.97,3794.824,3800.696,"It's better when they come in as a problem Solver, than an enforcement role.",101,,
814,0.97,3800.696,3808.437,"Okay, I will stop there and turn it over to Michele, at this point.",101,,
815,0.97,3808.437,3812.275,"Thank you, Geoff.",102,,
816,0.97,3812.275,3825.321,"So, how our process works when we get a housing complaint or a Renters rights complaint is, first of all, they call on one of our two members or reach us by the Website.",102,,
817,0.97,3825.321,3826.122,They make their complaint.,102,,
818,0.97,3826.122,3835.464,"That goes to a team of people who sends them to a supervising manager, who then assigns it to an Inspector or code compliance analyst.",102,,
819,0.97,3835.464,3842.338,"They do that based on how many cases the person has, as well as the area the inspector works in.",102,,
820,0.97,3842.338,3847.743,"Staff work through complaints and questions in the order they are received, except emergency housing conditions and Eviction problems.",102,,
821,0.97,3847.743,3852.515,Those get priority in our office.,102,,
822,0.97,3852.515,3857.486,We use several tools to get compliance.,102,,
823,0.97,3857.486,3864.727,"The most important thing is after the complaint comes in, we talked to the Renter and find out what is going on.",102,,
824,0.97,3864.727,3868.164,Then we talked to the landlord.,102,,
825,0.97,3868.164,3877.106,"They send the notice, issue the deposit return, and make repairs based on our contact with them and telling them about the issue.",102,,
826,0.97,3877.106,3883.379,"Sometimes we notice a violation and sometimes just by phone, depending on the type of complaint.",102,,
827,0.97,3883.379,3887.416,"Emergencies are top priorities of those are things like no heat, no water.",102,,
828,0.97,3887.416,3891.32,Sewer Backups.,102,,
829,0.97,3891.32,3897.627,Those get inspected within one day or the next business day.,102,,
830,0.97,3897.627,3899.095,"In 2021, we issued 22 emergency orders.",102,,
831,0.97,3899.095,3907.67,"All but six were resolved and that those six properties, we issued over $100,000 in emergency relocation assistance.",102,,
832,0.97,3907.67,3913.876,It is important to know we don't actually have an emergency relocation Fund.,102,,
833,0.97,3913.876,3916.112,We recouped that money from the landlord.,102,,
834,0.97,3916.112,3919.548,That money went to 22 tenants this last year.,102,,
835,0.97,3919.548,3922.018,16 of them were from one very severe property.,102,,
836,0.97,3922.018,3932.762,Physical issues with the living space always get a notice of violation and the notice of violation comes with a compliance due date.,102,,
837,0.97,3932.762,3941.103,We have to give at least 10 days for an appeal and usually we give 30 days to comply.,102,,
838,0.97,3941.103,3950.646,"The way the notice of violation works is again, it allows time for compliance and of compliance is not achieved, penalties start to accrue.",102,,
839,0.97,3950.646,3960.79,"Those can be up to $150 per day for the first 10 days and then $500 per day afterwards, plus there are inspection fees.",102,,
840,0.97,3960.79,3972.501,"However, to actually collect those fees, as has already been heard by the Councilmember, we have to go to the city attorney's office and have a case filed and then seek penalties through that civil action.",102,,
841,0.97,3972.501,3979.842,So that process takes a very long time and is only used when we don't get compliance.,102,,
842,0.97,3979.842,3986.282,"Again, since we get compliance most of the time, we only have to do this about 1% of the time.",102,,
843,0.97,3986.282,3991.654,Citations are another tool we have for a very small number of case types.,102,,
844,0.97,3991.654,3999.161,"They are used for security deposits, the right of first refusal, receipts for payments.",102,,
845,0.97,3999.161,4002.631,"All of those fall under one ordinance, which gives us the right to issue a citation.",102,,
846,0.97,4002.631,4010.606,Usually we issue a warning first and then penalties apply automatically at $500 for the first violation and $1000 for the next violation.,102,,
847,0.97,4010.606,4017.646,If we are still not receiving compliance we can issue a notice of violation and take the case to court.,102,,
848,0.97,4017.646,4026.789,"Citations are appealed to the hearing Examiner, so that is the fastest process, then going through the lot apartment, as well.",102,,
849,0.97,4026.789,4035.564,Some of the challenges we face with housing inspections our inspectors have to make appointments with the person to walk through during business hours.,102,,
850,0.97,4035.564,4043.239,"But that is the way we get access to the unit, through the tenant who lives there.",102,,
851,0.97,4043.239,4050.579,Many Renters call as they're moving out and inspectors are not able to get to the property and time to inspect.,102,,
852,0.97,4050.579,4054.85,"Sometimes issues get fixed before we get there, which is a good problem to have.",102,,
853,0.97,4054.85,4060.322,Sometimes we can't reach the tenant or they don't return our calls.,102,,
854,0.97,4060.322,4061.724,We also had process changes during the pandemic.,102,,
855,0.97,4061.724,4079.208,"There was a time period where we were not able to go in the housing, but we started a virtual inspection process to help us reach those tenants and where we were not able to use a virtual inspection, they waited until we were able to go back into housing.",102,,
856,0.97,4079.208,4081.911,But we are back into housing now and working through our backlog.,102,,
857,0.97,4081.911,4094.223,"The backlog is fairly big and that is causing us to have a slower time period to get out on inspections, because the case management or the cases are so backed up.",102,,
858,0.97,4094.223,4105.401,"You can see that in 2021, we really had a hard time getting out to the housing inspection after the call took 42 days.",102,,
859,0.97,4105.401,4115.578,"We have 143 open housing cases, which are in the notice of violation process, and 317 open housing complaints.",102,,
860,0.97,4115.578,4117.813,"The Pota group, as we said they do the Renters rights.",102,,
861,0.97,4117.813,4124.487,"There 46 open notice of violation, but 921 complaints and questions waiting for them.",102,,
862,0.97,4124.487,4135.865,"Sometimes those complaints are already in the investigation process, so it is important to know that complaints can be already being talked to and trying to resolve the problem before a case is opened.",102,,
863,0.97,4135.865,4141.804,"With that, I'm going to turn it back over to finish us off.",102,,
864,0.97,4141.804,4143.172,"Thank you, Michele.",103,,
865,0.97,4143.172,4147.042,"So, we tried to keep our presentation fairly short today.",103,,
866,0.97,4147.042,4154.316,I just wanted to focus the Council's attention on a couple of things.,103,,
867,0.97,4154.316,4161.891,"One, we have had quite an increase in call volume over the last 4 to 5 years.",103,,
868,0.97,4161.891,4167.53,Partly because of better outreach and training on our side.,103,,
869,0.97,4167.53,4177.907,Partly because we have new regulations that are covering a broader range of issues.,103,,
870,0.97,4177.907,4181.61,And we are really pleased with the fact that our business is going up.,103,,
871,0.97,4181.61,4188.484,"Because this is really, really important work.",103,,
872,0.97,4188.484,4203.399,"And I think, Councilmember Sawant, you said in your experience, our inspectors are, in fact, very committed to doing this work and resolving problems that they find in the community.",103,,
873,0.97,4203.399,4213.876,"It has been tough for us, as you heard, with the pandemic keeping us out of the housing inspection realm.",103,,
874,0.97,4213.876,4230.326,"We are now able to move back into that, but like many organizations, we have had staffing shortages and again, had some people who were not able, initially even, to go back out in the field.",103,,
875,0.97,4230.326,4236.031,We are working hard on reducing that response time.,103,,
876,0.97,4236.031,4239.068,I don't know if any of you were here.,103,,
877,0.97,4239.068,4269.531,"Back in the good old days, when we did less, frankly, and had probably a higher ratio of inspectors to complaints, we used to have a goal that was for the inspectors to be able to reach, usually by telephone, sometimes by Email, to get in touch with Complainants within seven days of that complaint getting assigned to them.",103,,
878,0.97,4269.531,4275.27,And then the inspection time would usually be within three weeks or so.,103,,
879,0.97,4275.27,4278.674,Sometimes a month.,103,,
880,0.97,4278.674,4285.981,"So we are far beyond that today, but we are working on reducing that backlog.",103,,
881,0.97,4285.981,4293.088,"And I think with that, we will just close this part of the presentation.",103,,
882,0.97,4293.088,4300.829,We are happy to answer any questions that you have of us.,103,,
883,0.97,4300.829,4311.573,"Thank you so much, everyone, from Sdci, and thank you, faith, especially, for helping lead this work.",104,,
884,0.97,4311.573,4319.915,"I know, faith, you will remember I think we first met personally Whn we were at the shadow apartments, I believe.",104,,
885,0.97,4319.915,4323.919,"Yes, that was a long time ago.",105,,
886,0.97,4323.919,4329.458,Very early in our rental inspections program.,105,,
887,0.97,4329.458,4340.202,I think my group learned a lot from some of those early meetings as did you and our tenant services group as a whole.,105,,
888,0.97,4340.202,4343.472,"Yes, thank you again for the work you all did.",106,,
889,0.97,4343.472,4348.777,"The department did in that issue, the shadow apartments.",106,,
890,0.97,4348.777,4368.864,"That was really an excellent example of where when Renters got organized and were aware of what rights they had and they were able to involve the Sdci, we got a lot of problems fixed and the Renters, as you know, ended up with much more than getting their problems fixed.",106,,
891,0.97,4368.864,4374.536,They also got compensation for it.,106,,
892,0.97,4374.536,4381.944,"I don't want to suggest it is the rule, it is the exception to the rule, but it shows when Renters get organized and fight for their rights, it can actually work, like in that instance.",106,,
893,0.97,4381.944,4389.785,So I have several questions to follow up from your presentation and I see Councilmember Morales's and up as well.,106,,
894,0.97,4389.785,4400.229,"For starters, in terms of the process you all explained how the Sdci works through complaints.",106,,
895,0.97,4400.229,4417.012,"One of the points you mentioned and I have been aware of this for a while, and it was reiterated on your side, I believe, that many Renters call as they're moving out and Sdci is not able to inspect before they leave.",106,,
896,0.97,4417.012,4420.716,"What of course, is consistent with what we have seen through Renters, Anecdotally.",106,,
897,0.97,4420.716,4430.225,It is the last resort and often they don't know that they could've called for a long time.,106,,
898,0.97,4430.225,4440.369,"They eventually find out, but then conditions are so bad or they persisted for so long that they ended up choosing to move, which is the last resort, but they have chosen the last resort by then.",106,,
899,0.97,4440.369,4453.348,"My question in terms of the process for the city is, is there anything in the lot right now where the Sdci is required to inspect, even after the tenant leaves?",106,,
900,0.97,4453.348,4476.171,"Because it is about that Renter unit and if the Renter moves, they are not facing that particular problem, but some other Renter, the next tenant, is going to face that problem and we heard from many Renters to say actually I moved out finally out of desperation, but I really feel for the next tenant to occupies that unit after I leave.",106,,
901,0.97,4476.171,4489.017,And I believe this happens frequently enough and it really illustrates a power imbalance between Renters and landlords.,106,,
902,0.97,4489.017,4508.27,"But what does the law say right now and the reason I am asking is because if it doesn't require that the city should inspect, even the tenant who made the complaint has left, but still the unit needs to be inspected.",106,,
903,0.97,4508.27,4522.718,"Right now we are not able to require a landlord to let us into a unit, if they don't want to.",107,,
904,0.97,4522.718,4529.424,"So, the only exception to that is through the rental inspection program.",107,,
905,0.97,4529.424,4540.002,"We do have those regularly established Rrio, rental registration and inspection ordinance inspections.",107,,
906,0.97,4540.002,4555.817,"If we find through a Rrio inspection that there are units, several units with several problems, through our auditing process we can require additional units or all units to be inspected.",107,,
907,0.97,4555.817,4592.22,"It is, sometimes, in theory it is possible to get a warrant to go into a particular unit that a tenant may have vacated, but getting a warrant requires going to court and proving, showing, that there is--I have forgotten which legal standard we have to meet to get a warrant, but it has to be, not beyond a reasonable doubt, but there is a preponderance or a very clear statement that there are real problems.",107,,
908,0.97,4592.22,4596.658,"So, we would not be able to speak to that.",107,,
909,0.97,4596.658,4601.53,"Very few tenants are willing to come and testify in court, because you know, they're busy.",107,,
910,0.97,4601.53,4602.164,They are working.,107,,
911,0.97,4602.164,4603.365,They just moved.,107,,
912,0.97,4603.365,4611.073,"So getting warrants, we never have.",107,,
913,0.97,4611.073,4612.507,We can call a landlord and ask.,107,,
914,0.97,4612.507,4616.578,We can say we got this complaint.,107,,
915,0.97,4616.578,4623.452,"Right now, because of the backlog, we probably would not have the capacity to start a program like that.",107,,
916,0.97,4623.452,4640.535,"But for us, finding a way to assure a tenant that we can help them, and that we have requirements to prevent retaliation, is what we found is best.",107,,
917,0.97,4640.535,4644.806,"Clearly we are getting more calls, so more tenants are learning.",107,,
918,0.97,4644.806,4646.608,"But as you heard today, people do wait.",107,,
919,0.97,4646.608,4653.315,They will wait months and that is something we wish we could prevent.,107,,
920,0.97,4653.315,4654.116,"Right, thank you.",108,,
921,0.97,4654.116,4665.327,I really appreciate that and that is precisely why my office genuinely wants to make sure that we close all the problems.,108,,
922,0.97,4665.327,4672.834,"I mean Obviously, it's not going to change the system by itself, but at least if we can reduce the problems that are there.",108,,
923,0.97,4672.834,4676.271,The loopholes in the current law.,108,,
924,0.97,4676.271,4692.721,"And just to follow up on that, I wanted to clarify that one of the reasons, you sort of addressed this, but one of the reasons tenants don't follow up and even when they know that they can complain to Sdci, they don't do that.",108,,
925,0.97,4692.721,4707.135,"They do it when they are desperate, as I said before, but also they have a fear of retaliation and they report it as they are about to move out, because they want to make sure the next tenant can have a better living condition.",108,,
926,0.97,4707.135,4711.807,But clearly the law is not addressing that.,108,,
927,0.97,4711.807,4717.913,They are not required to let Sdci into the unit.,108,,
928,0.97,4717.913,4721.783,You can enter as a city Inspector only when the tenant lets you in.,108,,
929,0.97,4721.783,4729.925,I think intimidation and retaliation obviously is a big point.,108,,
930,0.97,4729.925,4736.431,I also wanted to follow-up on one thing you said.,108,,
931,0.97,4736.431,4755.35,"You said, the Rrio allows you to inspect, you know, allows you to look into the conditions, but isn't it true that the landlord is free to choose a private Inspector and if they chose a private Inspector as opposed to the Sdci Inspector themselves, then Sdci does not get access.",108,,
932,0.97,4755.35,4760.355,"They look at the private inspector's report, right?",108,,
933,0.97,4760.355,4763.058,That's true.,109,,
934,0.97,4763.058,4774.436,The law requires that we offer the ability for a landlord to hire a private inspector.,109,,
935,0.97,4774.436,4788.85,"If they do that, if they hire a private Inspector, they need to inspect and don't want to share their data with us.",109,,
936,0.97,4788.85,4792.721,Then they have to inspect all of their units.,109,,
937,0.97,4792.721,4801.663,"We have pretty good inspectors, but I would admit that some inspectors have been a little bit lax.",109,,
938,0.97,4801.663,4806.334,"Geoff, your program, Rrio, runs that.",109,,
939,0.97,4806.334,4807.135,We work pretty hard.,109,,
940,0.97,4807.135,4812.007,We do follow-up surveys with tenants to see what they have had.,109,,
941,0.97,4812.007,4825.02,"We try to encourage people who feel dissatisfied with that private inspection to contact us, but again, it is sometimes really, really hard to get people to trust government.",109,,
942,0.97,4825.02,4830.792,And it is hard sometimes to get the private landlords to trust government.,109,,
943,0.97,4830.792,4843.705,"You know, to feel like we would do a good inspection and not, you know, take them to court over a loose electrical outlet cover.",109,,
944,0.97,4843.705,4850.812,So it is a balance.,109,,
945,0.97,4850.812,4856.718,"Yes, I will just say, though, we are so far from a situation of a landlord being penalized for a Lightbulb.",110,,
946,0.97,4856.718,4864.626,"The reality is the exact opposite, where tenants are facing major problems.",110,,
947,0.97,4864.626,4879.441,"I am not a housing Inspector, but I would imagine a broken furnace or anything like that, the black mold and Roach infestation, these are long- term conditions.",110,,
948,0.97,4879.441,4886.147,"These conditions don't develop in one day, so clearly they have been neglected for months, maybe even years.",110,,
949,0.97,4886.147,4899.961,"I do think that proposed legislation, just a note for myself and with Asha's help and your help, we need to address that.",110,,
950,0.97,4899.961,4906.768,"Who is doing the inspection and what is the quality of the inspection report, because it is not like it happens in one day.",110,,
951,0.97,4906.768,4910.338,Councilmember Morales.,110,,
952,0.97,4910.338,4916.645,"I have other questions but I want to invite Councilmember Morales and then other Councilmembers, indicate if you would like to speak.",110,,
953,0.97,4916.645,4917.212,Thank you.,111,,
954,0.97,4917.212,4919.881,Thanks for this presentation.,111,,
955,0.97,4919.881,4920.682,"Sorry, I lost my notes.",111,,
956,0.97,4920.682,4924.319,"Okay, I have two questions.",111,,
957,0.97,4924.319,4930.425,The first is that last year we were working to provide greater protection through the just cause Eviction ordinance.,111,,
958,0.97,4930.425,4934.696,We learned that ordinance would need to be updated to reflect changes at the state level.,111,,
959,0.97,4934.696,4939.167,So I am interested in a progress report on that.,111,,
960,0.97,4939.167,4952.814,"But regarding this, I guess I want to zoom out a little bit, because you talked about all of the different things your inspectors are responsible for, in addition to the housing issues.",111,,
961,0.97,4952.814,4959.688,"So we don't have to answer this now, but I am interested in how many inspectors you have.",111,,
962,0.97,4959.688,4962.724,What is the backlog on the Non- housing issues?,111,,
963,0.97,4962.724,4964.159,The average number of cases per Inspector?,111,,
964,0.97,4964.159,4966.995,How long does it take to resolve those other cases?,111,,
965,0.97,4966.995,4992.587,"Because as you said, if there are more things your inspectors are responsible for, and as a result, some of these Renters aren't getting the service that they need, that sounds to me like we need to perhaps increase your capacity to be able to do the things we are asking you to do.",111,,
966,0.97,4992.587,4995.023,"If you can answer any of those, that would be great.",111,,
967,0.97,4995.023,4998.193,If not I would like to follow up again to get some of that information.,111,,
968,0.97,4998.193,5004.366,I think what I would like to do on your second question is to defer for a week or 10 days.,112,,
969,0.97,5004.366,5019.814,"We are just wrapping up our year-end report for the code compliance division, which we typically send to the Council, the Mayor's office, and then post on our Website.",112,,
970,0.97,5019.814,5039.501,"That will, I believe, cover most everything that you ask and then we would be happy to answer any more specific questions, once you have had a chance to see our annual report, which does cover the whole spectrum of everything the code compliance division does.",112,,
971,0.97,5039.501,5056.584,"I will turn it over to Geoff for an update on that reconciliation bill, of what happened at state and city in the last couple of years.",112,,
972,0.97,5056.584,5058.019,We have been working on it.,113,,
973,0.97,5058.019,5059.788,We have been talking with the law Department.,113,,
974,0.97,5059.788,5070.331,We sort of know the broad strokes of where recent state changes intersect with the city law and where we need to make adjustments.,113,,
975,0.97,5070.331,5072.634,I think a lot of it will be very technical in nature.,113,,
976,0.97,5072.634,5077.072,"Way down into the code language, correcting terminology and such.",113,,
977,0.97,5077.072,5083.178,We held back a little bit to see where the state legislative session would go this year.,113,,
978,0.97,5083.178,5088.716,"As far as I know, there were no additional changes.",113,,
979,0.97,5088.716,5091.719,I think we are about ready to pick that up.,113,,
980,0.97,5091.719,5094.556,Capacity on our part and on the Council's part to receive it.,113,,
981,0.97,5094.556,5104.099,"I think the discussion we probably need to have, through the Council staff, and decide when the right time is.",113,,
982,0.97,5104.099,5109.604,"Thank you, for those responses.",114,,
983,0.97,5109.604,5127.288,I would also be interested in the responses to the question that was asked because all of that information would be very relevant for us to understand the scope of the problems.,114,,
984,0.97,5127.288,5131.96,So that would help us in drafting this new legislation.,114,,
985,0.97,5131.96,5143.938,"I have questions, but I wanted to wait for other Councilmembers to have an opportunity to ask questions or make comments.",114,,
986,0.97,5143.938,5144.772,I don't see any.,114,,
987,0.97,5144.772,5151.045,Let me quickly go ahead and ask a couple here.,114,,
988,0.97,5151.045,5165.293,"I don't know if you already answered this in the process of answering questions, but do you do an inspection every time a Renter requests one and how often does that happen?",114,,
989,0.97,5165.293,5170.331,What is the nature of how you do it often?,114,,
990,0.97,5170.331,5173.067,Does it often require that or does it always require that?,114,,
991,0.97,5173.067,5184.946,"Also, can you give us a sense of how independent, in the Lockdown era, you all mentioned that you switched to virtual, to some degree.",114,,
992,0.97,5184.946,5191.085,"It does not seem like it would work for everything, but to what extent did you use it?",114,,
993,0.97,5191.085,5203.031,"I am specifically asking because in the panel coming up in the next agenda item, one of the speakers, one of the Renters, they say they did send a complaint to Sdci, I believe during the Lockdown.",114,,
994,0.97,5203.031,5204.265,I am not positive about that.,114,,
995,0.97,5204.265,5206.301,"In any case, they did not receive a response.",114,,
996,0.97,5206.301,5216.044,"I am wondering if you had issues also with getting back to people last year, because of all the backlog, as we were discussing.",114,,
997,0.97,5216.044,5224.586,"Also, to what degree have these virtual inspections worked?",114,,
998,0.97,5224.586,5231.292,"Michele, can you speak to that with how your inspection groups are handling that?",115,,
999,0.97,5231.292,5243.504,"Yeah, so it was a small number of cases where we were able to use virtual inspections to be successful, but they were successful and Re-Inspections were easier to do, because we had already been in the housing and identified the problems.",116,,
1000,0.97,5243.504,5245.74,But we had about 81 virtual inspections last year.,116,,
1001,0.97,5245.74,5258.92,"We will be continuing to work on how we can use those as a tool, when a tenant doesn't want us to come into their unit, for whatever reason.",116,,
1002,0.97,5258.92,5268.663,"It is true, though, that virtual inspections, they don't give us a full view of everything that is in the unit.",117,,
1003,0.97,5268.663,5269.664,It is really hard.,117,,
1004,0.97,5269.664,5271.432,It is hard to smell if there is mildew.,117,,
1005,0.97,5271.432,5280.642,It is hard to touch a surface and see if it is spongy.,117,,
1006,0.97,5280.642,5281.909,They are okay for some things.,117,,
1007,0.97,5281.909,5287.548,"We probably Miss a lot, but maybe we get the one thing the tenant was calling about.",117,,
1008,0.97,5287.548,5305.633,"My impression, Michele, is that most housing inspections, housing complaints, do get a physical inspection now.",117,,
1009,0.97,5305.633,5306.701,When we can reach the tenant.,117,,
1010,0.97,5306.701,5311.973,"We lose some, but if the tenant wants us there, we will get there.",117,,
1011,0.97,5311.973,5326.387,"Now it is taking quite a while, but as I say, it may take three or four weeks or more these days, but we are committed to inspecting any time a tenant will let us in.",117,,
1012,0.97,5326.387,5333.161,"Okay, that is definitely helpful.",118,,
1013,0.97,5333.161,5342.27,"I will go ahead and ask one more question, but I am also realizing in the interest of time, we will have to follow up with you off-line and we will definitely do that.",118,,
1014,0.97,5342.27,5354.215,This discussion has provoked some useful questions I think that will help us draft this bill.,118,,
1015,0.97,5354.215,5361.522,One question I wanted to ask before closing this agenda item is does the city attorney's office ever refused to take a case to court?,118,,
1016,0.97,5361.522,5369.464,"Generally speaking, what are the parameters that are used?",118,,
1017,0.97,5369.464,5394.856,"I would say it is very rare for them to refuse, but they have, on occasion, when our case is not fantastic, they often are reluctant to take a case that is in compliance.",119,,
1018,0.97,5394.856,5409.27,"We have had cases where, in a particularly egregious situation, we wanted penalties.",119,,
1019,0.97,5409.27,5425.92,"And so they have taken a couple part of it is their workload and the other cases that are waiting and part of it is, they don't want to take a case that they think they are definitely going to lose.",119,,
1020,0.97,5425.92,5432.827,Every once in a while we have a disagreement about the law and they get to make that decision.,119,,
1021,0.97,5432.827,5441.369,"Sometimes we issue notices and they tell us, I don't think you guys are right.",119,,
1022,0.97,5441.369,5443.004,That happened once a couple of years ago.,119,,
1023,0.97,5443.004,5445.039,Made me unhappy.,119,,
1024,0.97,5445.039,5447.074,But we wound up settling that case.,119,,
1025,0.97,5447.074,5455.183,We have a really good working relationship with the city attorney's office.,119,,
1026,0.97,5455.183,5466.994,And I think my team does a very good job of interpreting the code and applying it in the field.,119,,
1027,0.97,5466.994,5468.196,So we do build good cases.,119,,
1028,0.97,5468.196,5472.433,Most of the time.,119,,
1029,0.97,5472.433,5474.469,"Right, that was also very useful.",120,,
1030,0.97,5474.469,5477.338,"Thank you, faith.",120,,
1031,0.97,5477.338,5487.715,"Sorry, I said that was the last question, but one last question, I believe I know the answer to this question, but I will ask anyway.",120,,
1032,0.97,5487.715,5497.859,"Are there penalties, legally are there penalties for landlords for retaliation or Harassment related to the process?",120,,
1033,0.97,5497.859,5498.659,There are penalties.,121,,
1034,0.97,5498.659,5507.802,The retaliation provisions--it is actually a fairly strong retaliation provision.,121,,
1035,0.97,5507.802,5520.581,"If a tenant complains to us and the next month after their landlord fixes whatever, he RAISES their rent.",121,,
1036,0.97,5520.581,5524.252,We are able to say that appears to be retaliation.,121,,
1037,0.97,5524.252,5526.454,We need to hold off on that rent increase.,121,,
1038,0.97,5526.454,5536.264,You can't do anything that decreases services or increases costs for 90 days after a tenant complains.,121,,
1039,0.97,5536.264,5552.48,"However, the retaliation provisions are in the regular housing code and under the housing code, we only issue notices of violation.",121,,
1040,0.97,5552.48,5564.258,"If they raise the rent in retaliation for a tenant making the complaint, their compliance is to withdraw that rent increase.",121,,
1041,0.97,5564.258,5568.262,Then they ban compliance and we would not proceed to penalize them.,121,,
1042,0.97,5568.262,5574.602,"So, it is very unusual for us to actually collect a penalty.",121,,
1043,0.97,5574.602,5580.908,We don't have citation authority for retaliation actions.,121,,
1044,0.97,5580.908,5587.014,We can only issue notices of violation and we want people.,121,,
1045,0.97,5587.014,5595.556,"We would rather get them to withdraw the rent increase, then collect $500 from them.",121,,
1046,0.97,5595.556,5600.628,And how often have you penalized landlords in that way?,122,,
1047,0.97,5600.628,5607.535,How often has that happened?,122,,
1048,0.97,5607.535,5614.008,"To actually go to court on a retaliation claim, I don't think we ever have.",123,,
1049,0.97,5614.008,5615.443,"Michele, you may recall, or Geoff.",123,,
1050,0.97,5615.443,5618.512,"No, we haven't.",124,,
1051,0.97,5618.512,5626.821,Landlords typically Resend the notice and that is how we get compliance.,124,,
1052,0.97,5626.821,5629.557,"Right, so we have not really imposed penalties for anything like that.",125,,
1053,0.97,5629.557,5635.563,"It comes up somewhat regularly and we do address it, but again, the landlords --",126,,
1054,0.97,5635.563,5644.905,"Okay, and actually all of this is also highlighting how there is one big hole here in the law, overall.",127,,
1055,0.97,5644.905,5652.213,Where the tenants get--even if fixed.,127,,
1056,0.97,5652.213,5659.086,"You know to do get compliance once a complaint is lodged, most of the time.",127,,
1057,0.97,5659.086,5671.499,"However, if the heating was off in winter for three weeks, the tenant is still paying the full rent for that month.",127,,
1058,0.97,5671.499,5673.968,There is nothing that the tenant can do to get compensated.,127,,
1059,0.97,5673.968,5681.275,"You know, get any monetary compensation for the really bad condition.",127,,
1060,0.97,5681.275,5682.276,It is not a minor thing.,127,,
1061,0.97,5682.276,5689.183,"Not having heat on a cold winter day, that is an egregious thing.",127,,
1062,0.97,5689.183,5723.551,"So it is a problem and also, even in the instances you're talking about, where you say you prefer they comply with the law and the pressure of that maybe forces them to Resend that increase and all of that, but one question that RAISES is if the landlords have the option of just reversing the retaliation, they don't actually face penalties for attempting to retaliate.",127,,
1063,0.97,5723.551,5730.958,How do you or how does your Department feel that would discourage continuation of these predatory practices?,127,,
1064,0.97,5730.958,5734.895,And please go ahead and answer.,127,,
1065,0.97,5734.895,5744.238,"I guess I don't really, I'm not sure I know how to answer that.",128,,
1066,0.97,5744.238,5752.146,"I think in our experience, the more landlords know, the better.",128,,
1067,0.97,5752.146,5761.088,"Most of them really like to avoid us, even though we work to be neutral.",128,,
1068,0.97,5761.088,5762.356,They still really like to avoid us.,128,,
1069,0.97,5762.356,5767.795,"So, for us, we have been most successful when we do outreach and education.",128,,
1070,0.97,5767.795,5781.208,"Regardless of penalties that might or might not get imposed, landlords, they don't want to deal with us.",128,,
1071,0.97,5781.208,5784.845,They want us to be happy and go away.,128,,
1072,0.97,5784.845,5794.622,"So, for us, avoiding things like retaliation is a lot about education, at least right now.",128,,
1073,0.97,5794.622,5796.056,"Okay, thank you.",129,,
1074,0.97,5796.056,5801.095,And you had a question?,129,,
1075,0.97,5801.095,5804.131,My question was along those lines.,130,,
1076,0.97,5804.131,5816.11,"I just wanted to confirm what we heard earlier, that the city attorney's office is reluctant to take a landlord to court, if the landlord is in compliance.",130,,
1077,0.97,5816.11,5840.734,"I think that is if I understand what that means, if there is a landlord who, for example, had a repair that they were supposed to complete and they did not do it within the Timeframe and then they started to accrue those penalties, $150 a day and time goes on and penalties buildup.",130,,
1078,0.97,5840.734,5850.845,And then eventually you at Sdci get to the point where you say something has to be done.,130,,
1079,0.97,5850.845,5853.113,You send it to the city attorney's office.,130,,
1080,0.97,5853.113,5858.385,The city attorney's office is now looking to bring them to court and at that point they say I will fix it.,130,,
1081,0.97,5858.385,5860.154,So now they are in compliance.,130,,
1082,0.97,5860.154,5866.727,"Does that mean the city attorney's office is Okay, forget about those fines that accrue --",130,,
1083,0.97,5866.727,5888.449,"Well, you know, I would say that in the situation you just described, I think at that point if it had gone on for so long and was so bad that we referred it and then they complied, in those cases, we do frequently collect a penalty.",131,,
1084,0.97,5888.449,5895.155,We just don't see it so much with housing code issues.,131,,
1085,0.97,5895.155,5900.027,"So, they do work with us.",131,,
1086,0.97,5900.027,5912.006,If we say this was just a completely egregious case and we want some penalties and we feel like we need to make a point.,131,,
1087,0.97,5912.006,5915.676,They will work with us.,131,,
1088,0.97,5915.676,5921.548,"It is not forever, but it has to be really bad.",131,,
1089,0.97,5921.548,5927.054,I actually do see the exact situation that Ted just described.,131,,
1090,0.97,5927.054,5933.327,We see that frequently with people who have built things without building permits.,131,,
1091,0.97,5933.327,5940.868,It often takes the threat or an actual lawsuit to get them to go through the building permit process.,131,,
1092,0.97,5940.868,5951.211,"When those come into compliance, we do usually collect some number, thousands of dollars, five or 10 or more, depending on the issue.",131,,
1093,0.97,5951.211,5952.98,So it is not unheard of.,131,,
1094,0.97,5952.98,5967.127,"I just think most of our landlords do fix things before it gets to be really, really egregious.",131,,
1095,0.97,5967.127,5970.464,Thank you.,132,,
1096,0.97,5970.464,5975.803,Everyone from the Department.,132,,
1097,0.97,5975.803,5982.676,"We will definitely be following up with you, because we will be working on this legislation.",132,,
1098,0.97,5982.676,5999.993,"And starting the next agenda item, I do want to say that it seems pretty striking to me, just in terms of the law.",132,,
1099,0.97,5999.993,6001.595,This is not a comment on the Sdci.,132,,
1100,0.97,6001.595,6007.134,"As we have said many times, staff is very helpful and knowledgeable and committed to the work.",132,,
1101,0.97,6007.134,6021.749,But in terms of the status quo of both the legal requirements on landlords and also just the social dynamic of the landlords having far more power than Renters.,132,,
1102,0.97,6021.749,6035.329,"It is, I cannot help but be struck by the overwhelming contrast between how if Renters don't pay their rent, the law is applied aggressively.",132,,
1103,0.97,6035.329,6036.53,This is not an aggregate.,132,,
1104,0.97,6036.53,6039.366,Obviously everyone has to comply with the law.,132,,
1105,0.97,6039.366,6046.54,"And in our experience, overwhelmingly, Renters try very hard to pay their rent.",132,,
1106,0.97,6046.54,6053.614,"Overwhelmingly, I can actually remember a single instance when their rent was not paid or was not paid on time.",132,,
1107,0.97,6053.614,6059.286,It was not because of financial desperation.,132,,
1108,0.97,6059.286,6062.456,"When Renters are in financial dire Straits, that is the only time.",132,,
1109,0.97,6062.456,6069.463,"We have held off instances where tenants were taken to court, just for falling short by three dollars.",132,,
1110,0.97,6069.463,6070.831,This is not a made up thing.,132,,
1111,0.97,6070.831,6086.113,"It is an actual thing that happened and the tenant bravely fought and defeated her Eviction notice, but the point is, the law is applied so aggressively against Renters and on the other side it seems that landlords can get a friendly reminder.",132,,
1112,0.97,6086.113,6096.857,"Yes, they can get fined in some cases, but they get so many chances to do the right thing.",132,,
1113,0.97,6096.857,6099.693,I just find that really glaring and we have to do something about it.,132,,
1114,0.97,6099.693,6102.729,I'm not pretending this legislation will fix that.,132,,
1115,0.97,6102.729,6117.778,"It is an important thing, but it highlights the nature of the so-called housing market in our system and how disproportionate the power is between landlords, that landlords have against their tenants.",132,,
1116,0.97,6117.778,6125.919,I also wanted to just mention and this is specifically what we want to follow up with the Sdci about.,132,,
1117,0.97,6125.919,6132.793,"We hear that there is compliance on a timely manner, but that is not what we are hearing from Renters.",132,,
1118,0.97,6132.793,6141.735,"This is not the first time we have heard from them in public comment and I have personally, my staff and I, we have visited that location many times.",132,,
1119,0.97,6141.735,6147.441,We have witnessed those conditions and they are not being fixed.,132,,
1120,0.97,6147.441,6150.544,"Some have been fixed, but overwhelmingly those conditions languish.",132,,
1121,0.97,6150.544,6165.726,We would definitely want to follow-up with the Sdci specifically on that issue and I want Renters watching this to reach out to us if they have not already done so.,132,,
1122,0.97,6165.726,6178.939,"So now I want to switch to item number two where we have a Renter and Renter advocate panel and I realize we're running a little bit late, but that is because we had a good problem, which is many members of the public showing up for public comment.",132,,
1123,0.97,6178.939,6185.212,I want to start with the two Renters on our panel and then we will call on the Renter advocate.,132,,
1124,0.97,6185.212,6189.683,First we have Jesse.,132,,
1125,0.97,6189.683,6199.092,Please introduce yourself for the record and then make your comments and then I will call on the next Speaker.,132,,
1126,0.97,6199.092,6199.86,"Hello, everyone.",133,,
1127,0.97,6199.86,6212.839,"So I was living in the Audrey apartment complex in Fremont and on February 25, in the morning, the front end of the building burned down.",133,,
1128,0.97,6212.839,6216.476,The first four apartments.,133,,
1129,0.97,6216.476,6231.959,"Shortly after, the next day, the whole place was robbed because--sorry.",133,,
1130,0.97,6231.959,6235.429,The landlords did not properly secure the building.,133,,
1131,0.97,6235.429,6237.631,We were all looted.,133,,
1132,0.97,6237.631,6241.101,They just kicked open the doors.,133,,
1133,0.97,6241.101,6241.902,There was nothing.,133,,
1134,0.97,6241.902,6250.844,"There was no security that they were supposed to do in a vacated building, because we were told that we could not even live there.",133,,
1135,0.97,6250.844,6262.656,"After the fact, really had no assistance, besides the Red Cross, to help me transition into a new place.",133,,
1136,0.97,6262.656,6273.2,And since then they have just Karma the landlords have not assisted us at all.,133,,
1137,0.97,6273.2,6284.578,They tried to get us to sign a document to just get our security Department deposits back and then not having anything to do with us after the fact.,133,,
1138,0.97,6284.578,6287.08,Luckily we banded together and made sure we did not sign that.,133,,
1139,0.97,6287.08,6291.485,"But Yeah, completely have felt neglected the entire time.",133,,
1140,0.97,6291.485,6295.322,Having to deal with my stuff.,133,,
1141,0.97,6295.322,6299.993,"Luckily, things are getting better.",133,,
1142,0.97,6299.993,6301.828,Literally the most traumatic experience in my life.,133,,
1143,0.97,6301.828,6314.007,"I should mention also, there were no alarms going off at all and we all made sure that hours all were working and had batteries.",133,,
1144,0.97,6314.007,6318.712,"But I woke up to my fellow neighbor pounding on my door, saying there was a fire and I had to get out.",133,,
1145,0.97,6318.712,6320.914,So I could have died.,133,,
1146,0.97,6320.914,6321.948,So that is my say.,133,,
1147,0.97,6321.948,6326.42,Thank you for listening.,133,,
1148,0.97,6326.42,6330.59,"Thank you so much, Jesse, and if you are able to stay, please stay.",134,,
1149,0.97,6330.59,6342.469,It is just horrendous what you were put through and I definitely think we should talk to you and your fellow tenants.,134,,
1150,0.97,6342.469,6350.177,"Previous fellow tenants, to make sure that at the very least at this point, your rights are being met.",134,,
1151,0.97,6350.177,6352.612,I am glad to hear you did not sign that document.,134,,
1152,0.97,6352.612,6353.647,I read through that document.,134,,
1153,0.97,6353.647,6367.227,"It is egregious that the landlord attempted to do that and as you said, you know, you could have lost your life had your neighbors not warned you.",134,,
1154,0.97,6367.227,6369.096,So thank you so much for sharing that story.,134,,
1155,0.97,6369.096,6373.533,"We have Ellen Anderson next, who is also a Renter in the city.",134,,
1156,0.97,6373.533,6377.204,Go ahead and introduce yourself.,134,,
1157,0.97,6377.204,6378.205,Thank you.,135,,
1158,0.97,6378.205,6379.005,"Hi, I am Ellen.",135,,
1159,0.97,6379.005,6385.946,I am a full-time student studying psychology at Seattle central and I live in district 2 at beacon Hill.,135,,
1160,0.97,6385.946,6390.617,I wanted to say thank you to Councilmember Sawant and her office for inviting me.,135,,
1161,0.97,6390.617,6394.855,The experience I am sharing with the committee today is pretty common.,135,,
1162,0.97,6394.855,6404.431,"So, the rental home that we lived in, until about three months ago.",135,,
1163,0.97,6404.431,6407.467,"So, everyone in our house with four roommates is under 35, has decent jobs.",135,,
1164,0.97,6407.467,6412.139,But finding housing is still super difficult for us.,135,,
1165,0.97,6412.139,6420.147,"I love my Housemates, but like most young people, living Communally is not a lifestyle choice, it is an economic necessity.",135,,
1166,0.97,6420.147,6427.22,"Even with four incomes, we don't have the luxury of Prioritizing quality housing over cheap housing.",135,,
1167,0.97,6427.22,6434.127,"When we moved into our house five years ago, we were super excited because the rent was quote Unquote reasonable Percy Atul standards.",135,,
1168,0.97,6434.127,6439.633,Meeting it was actually an affordable rent with our pooled incomes.,135,,
1169,0.97,6439.633,6449.509,"It had a big backyard, fireplace, and was on a convenient bus line.",135,,
1170,0.97,6449.509,6451.378,We knew the House would have a lot of problems.,135,,
1171,0.97,6451.378,6459.453,"What kept us there despite these problems was the fact that in five years that we lived there, our rent never got raised.",135,,
1172,0.97,6459.453,6464.457,"Anyone who has been a Renter in the city knows that for the last decade, rent increases have been out of control.",135,,
1173,0.97,6464.457,6473.867,"Unfortunately, two of our roommates came to the House trying to escape a rat infestation at their previous home.",135,,
1174,0.97,6473.867,6482.409,Unfortunately we battled an intense rat infestation in this House as well and that lasted for months.,135,,
1175,0.97,6482.409,6484.177,We big our landlord to call an Exterminator.,135,,
1176,0.97,6484.177,6488.715,I personally spent hundreds of dollars on traps.,135,,
1177,0.97,6488.715,6493.386,I slept in the living room for months because the sound of rats fighting in the walls would keep me up at night.,135,,
1178,0.97,6493.386,6498.725,"I paid the full rent, fearing if I didn't, we would all be evicted.",135,,
1179,0.97,6498.725,6499.826,Our landlord faced no consequences.,135,,
1180,0.97,6499.826,6504.564,We ended up having to deal with the situation ourselves.,135,,
1181,0.97,6504.564,6513.707,Not a dollar was cut from the rent to compensate for the time and money that we put in and the months of stress and difficulties we faced.,135,,
1182,0.97,6513.707,6515.709,Over the course of five years we never missed rent.,135,,
1183,0.97,6515.709,6516.543,We never paid late.,135,,
1184,0.97,6516.543,6521.615,"We worked hard to improve the spaces, despite that we did not own it.",135,,
1185,0.97,6521.615,6523.149,"We gardened, painted, Rewired where necessary.",135,,
1186,0.97,6523.149,6531.591,"The final straw was when I woke up one morning, put my feet down and realized I was in seven inches of standing water.",135,,
1187,0.97,6531.591,6534.427,The response from our landlord was Laughably inadequate.,135,,
1188,0.97,6534.427,6537.264,They drilled holes in the foundation.,135,,
1189,0.97,6537.264,6547.841,"They told us so in the future, the Floodwater would have a place to drain and gave me a large fan to put in my basement room.",135,,
1190,0.97,6547.841,6549.442,The room still reeked of persistent damp.,135,,
1191,0.97,6549.442,6552.913,A really Moldy smell.,135,,
1192,0.97,6552.913,6560.82,"Surely the drywall and Baseboards, which were warped and clearly full of water, were compromised and the flooring was never replaced.",135,,
1193,0.97,6560.82,6570.764,"The landlords explanation was that a tree root was going into the foundation and had cracked it, which indicated very serious and dangerous structural issues with the entire house.",135,,
1194,0.97,6570.764,6582.742,"The leak from the other side of the basement, they had no X live nation, explanation other than that it rained heavily.",135,,
1195,0.97,6582.742,6585.412,Which is common in Seattle and is what happens in houses at times.,135,,
1196,0.97,6585.412,6597.39,"I think this really drives home the reality facing Renters where if we skip our rent once, we can be evicted and made homeless, but landlords could and would leave us in unfavorable conditions and faced no consequences.",135,,
1197,0.97,6597.39,6611.404,"One of my Housemates filed an Online complaint on the Sdci Website to request a housing inspection, because we were increasingly concerned that the entire house was unfit for occupation.",135,,
1198,0.97,6611.404,6616.309,Highlighted that my room in particular was completely unlivable.,135,,
1199,0.97,6616.309,6623.583,"Unfortunately we never heard back from Sdci, by phone or Email, and we were forced to move out of the house.",135,,
1200,0.97,6623.583,6630.69,"I fear for the future tenants who move in, because the reality of renting is that it is super easy in the short term tied damage.",135,,
1201,0.97,6630.69,6641.468,"This situation from floods and mold, without addressing the fact that this House needs major structural repairs and likely should not be inhabited until repairs are carried out.",135,,
1202,0.97,6641.468,6655.482,"I have no doubt the Sdci, especially just now hearing from them, like many other resources in Seattle, they are underfunded and incredibly backed up.",135,,
1203,0.97,6655.482,6655.882,We are lucky.,135,,
1204,0.97,6655.882,6686.746,"We were in a position to be able to barely afford to move, but the move basically drained the bank accounts of everyone in our house and the fact that the global Covid pandemic and economic crisis has not ended, really means that our house, that me and my Housemates, are one paycheck away or one injury away from not being able to pay rent.",135,,
1205,0.97,6686.746,6695.889,"This makes it incredibly shameful, I think, that the majority of the city council voted to repeal the Eviction moratorium on top of the pandemic and worsening House prices.",135,,
1206,0.97,6695.889,6703.396,"Now in our new house we are paying almost twice as much rent and we have lived here for 2 1/2, almost three months.",135,,
1207,0.97,6703.396,6705.598,We are already struggling with our new landlord.,135,,
1208,0.97,6705.598,6710.637,Not addressing broken appliances or leaks we find in our house.,135,,
1209,0.97,6710.637,6712.338,That we noticed the day we move in.,135,,
1210,0.97,6712.338,6720.547,I think this is why we need rent control and to support the kind of legislation we are seeing Councilmember Sawant put forward.,135,,
1211,0.97,6720.547,6729.823,"We need to strengthen tenants rights, because I think of this experience has taught me anything, landlords will continue to Prioritize profits and not housing.",135,,
1212,0.97,6729.823,6736.93,Thank you very much for listening.,135,,
1213,0.97,6736.93,6743.436,"Thank you, Ellen, for sharing that story.",136,,
1214,0.97,6743.436,6747.54,"We have follow-up points for Jesse and you both, so if you are able to stay, that would be great.",136,,
1215,0.97,6747.54,6751.544,"Can we have Larson go next, thank you.",136,,
1216,0.97,6751.544,6752.679,"Hi, good morning.",137,,
1217,0.97,6752.679,6758.051,Thanks for having me.,137,,
1218,0.97,6758.051,6761.121,I am the community engagement manager of the housing justice project.,137,,
1219,0.97,6761.121,6769.229,I just want to start this off by saying that we are very appreciative of Sdci.,137,,
1220,0.97,6769.229,6770.697,We have a close relationship with them.,137,,
1221,0.97,6770.697,6780.306,"You know, the tenants that make their way to our clinic because they are getting evicted are generally facing some type of Habitability issues at their apartment.",137,,
1222,0.97,6780.306,6787.514,"So you know, those, we try and connect them with Sdci.",137,,
1223,0.97,6787.514,6796.222,"So I will just say, though, I have a lot of friends personally that are not aware of Sdci.",137,,
1224,0.97,6796.222,6804.464,"So I think this is a larger issue of capacity for them, but also getting the word out there.",137,,
1225,0.97,6804.464,6819.412,"So you know, supporting Councilmember Sawant's proposal, would allow, it would be great if we could have like a tenant advocate.",137,,
1226,0.97,6819.412,6822.782,"Those groups that would be able to enforce discrimination laws, city ordinances.",137,,
1227,0.97,6822.782,6828.955,Just because Sdci is not able to do that.,137,,
1228,0.97,6828.955,6830.79,They have limited power to enforce the laws.,137,,
1229,0.97,6830.79,6837.497,They can't seek injunctions.,137,,
1230,0.97,6837.497,6839.532,A lot of what they do is reacting to complaints.,137,,
1231,0.97,6839.532,6849.275,"You know, issuing notice violations, but like they said, if the landlord stops doing that, then the case is closed.",137,,
1232,0.97,6849.275,6881.374,"But if we could have tenant advocates where the tenants Union--who are generally, probably in contact with a lot more tenants than Sdci is, we would be able to bring those cases forward, right, on behalf of the tenants and get them some type of relief, rather than just kind of waiting and hoping the inspection happens.",137,,
1233,0.97,6881.374,6885.445,"Because the landlord can just stop doing it, once they have been issued a notice, and then they can resume.",137,,
1234,0.97,6885.445,6891.551,"Again, I will just share an example of a tenant that I was working with during the moratorium.",137,,
1235,0.97,6891.551,6900.66,"Who was still paying rent, but they called us because they had not had water for over two years.",137,,
1236,0.97,6900.66,6906.366,"You know, this was not an issue that was raised to Sdci, because they did not speak English.",137,,
1237,0.97,6906.366,6916.109,"So you know, there are so many reasons that tenants aren't able to reach out to Sdci.",137,,
1238,0.97,6916.109,6933.993,"We were able to make contact with the landlord and try to get it resolved, but eventually you know after months and months of going back and forth, it turned out that there was an actual issue with the water pipes.",137,,
1239,0.97,6933.993,6944.737,It had been damaged during construction of Townhomes and the landlord just opted not to fix it.,137,,
1240,0.97,6944.737,6958.785,"They did not technically have to and eventually you know, Sdci issued a notice that the building, you know, that the house was Inhabitable and the tenant did not have anywhere to go.",137,,
1241,0.97,6958.785,6962.622,"During this entire process, the landlord was still collecting rent.",137,,
1242,0.97,6962.622,6974.0,"They actually raised the rent, quite significantly for this tenant, who was on, you know, very limited income, due to their age.",137,,
1243,0.97,6974.0,6980.707,They did not have the ability to work.,137,,
1244,0.97,6980.707,6995.955,"So situations like that where the tenants are in contact with us and it would've been great if we were able to do something on their behalf and get them some type of relief and damages, but we don't have that power, currently.",137,,
1245,0.97,6995.955,6996.556,Neither does Sdci.,137,,
1246,0.97,6996.556,7000.226,"I think if we could establish something like that, that would be wonderful.",137,,
1247,0.97,7000.226,7007.967,"I understand not all landlords are bad, but there are some landlords who are not doing what they should be doing.",137,,
1248,0.97,7007.967,7018.311,Those tenants should not be just left out and left to figure it out themselves and hope for the best.,137,,
1249,0.97,7018.311,7026.853,"I think, as a society, we should be protecting vulnerable folks from being exploited like that.",137,,
1250,0.97,7026.853,7027.854,Thank you so much.,138,,
1251,0.97,7027.854,7031.09,I definitely agree.,138,,
1252,0.97,7031.09,7032.125,I know good landlords.,138,,
1253,0.97,7032.125,7039.032,There was a good landlord who testified today who said she supported this legislation.,138,,
1254,0.97,7039.032,7040.266,"And I know others, as well.",138,,
1255,0.97,7040.266,7053.846,"But at the end of the day, this is also a question of what laws we have and also if landlords are being good to the tenants, they will not be affected by the legislation in any way.",138,,
1256,0.97,7053.846,7058.317,This is the point we are repeatedly making.,138,,
1257,0.97,7058.317,7062.588,"If you are not Mistreating tenants, not exploiting them, it will not affect you.",138,,
1258,0.97,7062.588,7070.263,"Similarly if you are not having skyrocketing rent, then rent control policy will not affect you because you are treating your tenants in a decent manner.",138,,
1259,0.97,7070.263,7081.574,"Before I go to Kate next, I just wanted to clarify, did you say the tenant you talked to did not have water for two years?",138,,
1260,0.97,7081.574,7084.31,Yes.,139,,
1261,0.97,7084.31,7085.878,He did not have water for two years.,139,,
1262,0.97,7085.878,7092.251,Was still paying rent every month and paying for his own water.,139,,
1263,0.97,7092.251,7101.594,"He literally had to go by Jugs of water to be able to, you know, Cook, take showers, use the bathroom.",139,,
1264,0.97,7101.594,7106.666,"Oh my God, this is an egregious case.",140,,
1265,0.97,7106.666,7112.138,If you don't mind can my staff follow up with you off-line to get more details?,140,,
1266,0.97,7112.138,7120.079,"I know it is an issue from the past, but I think it really helps to highlight why improving the law is necessary?",140,,
1267,0.97,7120.079,7120.48,Absolutely.,141,,
1268,0.97,7120.48,7122.915,Thank you so much.,142,,
1269,0.97,7122.915,7130.423,Thanks for having me.,143,,
1270,0.97,7130.423,7139.765,Also works closely with Sdci and Sdci is usually the first thing we tell a tenant who is experiencing problems in their building that their landlord is not fixing.,143,,
1271,0.97,7139.765,7152.044,"We are very quick to tell them, report them to Sdci, and we get Pushback a lot from tenants who don't want to upset or offend their landlord.",143,,
1272,0.97,7152.044,7158.384,Especially if they get the Runaround on getting the inspection.,143,,
1273,0.97,7158.384,7160.453,"Oh Yeah, we will get to it.",143,,
1274,0.97,7160.453,7163.99,"Or the smaller Mom-And-Pop folks have limited time, limited funds.",143,,
1275,0.97,7163.99,7170.263,"They will get to this as soon as they can and tenants, of course, have empathy for landlords, too.",143,,
1276,0.97,7170.263,7176.202,But it is this ongoing problem and it costs a lot of money in the interim.,143,,
1277,0.97,7176.202,7187.747,"If your heat is not working and your landlord is saying we will get to it soon, a lot of people buy a heater.",143,,
1278,0.97,7187.747,7189.982,"If the stove is not working, they buy a toaster oven.",143,,
1279,0.97,7189.982,7197.089,These unexpected costs add up and an additional cost taking time off work to let an Inspector in.,143,,
1280,0.97,7197.089,7204.597,And there is no real restitution for living in poor conditions.,143,,
1281,0.97,7204.597,7211.304,Or even just worse conditions than what your lease States you should be living in.,143,,
1282,0.97,7211.304,7216.576,Renters often don't report code violations until they have kind of reached their breaking point.,143,,
1283,0.97,7216.576,7238.064,"And then with the average of 42.3 days from the date of report to date of inspection, that is a really long time to live without hot water or without heat or with faulty electricity.",143,,
1284,0.97,7238.064,7251.944,"So I know Sdci has a 100% rate of solving these issues, which is fantastic.",143,,
1285,0.97,7251.944,7268.194,But I think it is not really fair for Renters who are dealing with these issues for so long before they have to get Sdci involved and then Sdci does not have a lot of power as far as enforcing fines.,143,,
1286,0.97,7268.194,7274.9,"We saw there were five fines in 2021, but 3000 500 complaints.",143,,
1287,0.97,7274.9,7285.845,"That is a lot of people suffering with really bad conditions and did not receive any kind of restitution, other than what was done.",143,,
1288,0.97,7285.845,7290.716,"They could bring them to small claims court, but again, that is time out of their day.",143,,
1289,0.97,7290.716,7291.35,That is money.,143,,
1290,0.97,7291.35,7291.984,That is complicated.,143,,
1291,0.97,7291.984,7299.091,Most tenants are not going to want to go through that and landlords are not really afraid of code violations.,143,,
1292,0.97,7299.091,7325.051,"I know if I parked in front of a fire Hydrant every day and the person who lived outside the fire Hydrant called and reported me and it took over a month to come out and then they just warned me and I had another month or whatever to move my car, that is just not how it works in other areas with code enforcement.",143,,
1293,0.97,7325.051,7336.862,"That is nothing to say about Sdci's policies, other than they need more funding for inspectors and they need to be able to issue some of these fines.",143,,
1294,0.97,7336.862,7340.933,Without landlords having any fear of them being fined.,143,,
1295,0.97,7340.933,7345.171,There is not a lot of incentive for them to follow the law.,143,,
1296,0.97,7345.171,7354.513,To hurry up and get inspections done in the required time and keep the units nice.,143,,
1297,0.97,7354.513,7356.349,"Inspected every few years anyway, every 5 to 10.",143,,
1298,0.97,7356.349,7357.383,That is a long time.,143,,
1299,0.97,7357.383,7362.488,A lot of stuff can go wrong.,143,,
1300,0.97,7362.488,7368.394,So I think furthering these protections and furthering the enforcement of these is so important.,143,,
1301,0.97,7368.394,7374.266,To balance the power a little bit.,143,,
1302,0.97,7374.266,7381.807,"I know the Sdci tries very hard to be impartial, but there is already this power imbalance between Renters and landlords.",143,,
1303,0.97,7381.807,7388.28,Landlords are the ones responsible for maintaining a property that is up to certain code standards.,143,,
1304,0.97,7388.28,7402.094,"Landlords who seem to be opposed to this and say they're not getting a voice, that not all Stakeholders are being invited to the table, I disagree.",143,,
1305,0.97,7402.094,7405.831,I feel like you knew what you signed up for when you became a landlord.,143,,
1306,0.97,7405.831,7413.072,The city puts out very clear expectations of how the unit needs to be maintained.,143,,
1307,0.97,7413.072,7413.873,So you know.,143,,
1308,0.97,7413.873,7426.485,"You know the laws and if you don't, there are tons of resources and the tenants have to be the ones to initiate the complaint process and still receive nothing in return.",143,,
1309,0.97,7426.485,7428.754,The landlords do not really receive punishment for violating the code violation.,143,,
1310,0.97,7428.754,7432.158,It is very frustrating.,143,,
1311,0.97,7432.158,7432.958,"Thank you, Kate.",144,,
1312,0.97,7432.958,7453.879,"I wanted to highlight one thing that you mentioned that in 2021, as the Sdci shared in the presentation, there were thousands of complaints and as you said, that is a lot of Renters facing dilapidated conditions or a lack of heat or all of those things.",144,,
1313,0.97,7453.879,7470.563,"And then on top of that, in the context of the fact that probably the majority of Renters don't send these complaints and, because they are demoralized or because they don't even know this can be done.",144,,
1314,0.97,7470.563,7480.105,"So, the real number of Renters who faced some sort of problem of this kind last year is probably far more than that number.",144,,
1315,0.97,7480.105,7483.075,So it really highlights the scale of the problem.,144,,
1316,0.97,7483.075,7493.552,So now our Speaker is Violet--go ahead.,144,,
1317,0.97,7500.793,7503.028,"I think, it looks like we lost Violet.",145,,
1318,0.97,7503.028,7504.263,She was gone before.,145,,
1319,0.97,7504.263,7509.969,Let me check.,145,,
1320,0.97,7509.969,7515.274,Violet seems to have become disconnected.,145,,
1321,0.97,7515.274,7521.947,"Okay, so I just wanted to quickly say a few things.",146,,
1322,0.97,7521.947,7524.984,"I know we have one other agenda item, which we need to finish.",146,,
1323,0.97,7524.984,7537.796,"But going back to Jesse, again, unfortunately all of the stories we have heard are egregious to various degrees.",146,,
1324,0.97,7537.796,7544.503,"So, Jesse, you mentioned the settlement agreement that we have also looked at.",146,,
1325,0.97,7544.503,7559.385,"That the landlord tried to get tenants to sign on to and the settlement agreement, I believe we attached to the agenda today.",146,,
1326,0.97,7559.385,7563.022,"It says the Renter gets the security deposit back, which is not some favor the landlord is doing.",146,,
1327,0.97,7563.022,7567.86,It is legally required anyway for the landlord to do.,146,,
1328,0.97,7567.86,7570.496,"It also says, look how egregious the settlement agreement is.",146,,
1329,0.97,7570.496,7573.766,It says the Renter cannot sue for anything.,146,,
1330,0.97,7573.766,7579.438,The Renter AGREES to end the lease the day before the fire.,146,,
1331,0.97,7579.438,7588.18,They are essentially waiving their rights to relocation assistance and any other damages they are otherwise entitled to.,146,,
1332,0.97,7588.18,7592.618,"The Renter cannot talk about what happened or post about it on social media and if they do, the landlord can sue.",146,,
1333,0.97,7592.618,7598.524,The landlord tried to get Renters to sign this essentially by lying to them and saying they needed to sign to get their security deposit back.,146,,
1334,0.97,7598.524,7609.301,"I think as Jesse explained, it is really important that all of the tenants of this building, including Jesse, they got together.",146,,
1335,0.97,7609.301,7614.173,They understood that the landlord has no right to do this.,146,,
1336,0.97,7614.173,7615.441,They refused to sign this document.,146,,
1337,0.97,7615.441,7623.515,"This is an important example of how tenants can come together and push back collectively, that it can work.",146,,
1338,0.97,7623.515,7638.197,I also think that all of this that the landlord attempted to do should be illegal.,146,,
1339,0.97,7638.197,7643.168,"I also don't know if Tram wanted to weigh in on this, but I believe in commercial contracts, deceptive practices are illegal.",146,,
1340,0.97,7643.168,7650.342,"But it is not clear to me whether in residential Landlord/Tenant agreements, what the law is.",146,,
1341,0.97,7650.342,7662.287,"Maybe if you wanted to weigh in on that and also Jesse, if you wanted to say anything more about what happened with you and the other tenants.",146,,
1342,0.97,7662.287,7673.732,"Well, so, it was as you said, crazy, that they had us try and sign these documents.",147,,
1343,0.97,7673.732,7682.474,"Especially in the midst of trying to figure out moving, getting my stuff out.",147,,
1344,0.97,7682.474,7689.181,And cleaning my place in general.,147,,
1345,0.97,7689.181,7695.854,"It was just, like I said, so much neglect.",147,,
1346,0.97,7695.854,7704.997,"The worst part is how there was no security in a vacated building, the next day.",147,,
1347,0.97,7704.997,7708.867,"Like I said, they literally kicked open the doors.",147,,
1348,0.97,7708.867,7714.373,"We have locks, but they are Keypads.",147,,
1349,0.97,7714.373,7716.942,Obviously that did not stop the Looters.,147,,
1350,0.97,7716.942,7725.517,And it was not even then that security was put up.,147,,
1351,0.97,7725.517,7731.023,"The next day, they boarded up the building.",147,,
1352,0.97,7731.023,7737.329,Looters took those off and kicked the doors open again.,147,,
1353,0.97,7737.329,7739.765,"So my place was robbed twice, as far as I am aware.",147,,
1354,0.97,7739.765,7740.566,"Others, more than that.",147,,
1355,0.97,7740.566,7751.543,"In the meantime, trying to figure out--I was one of the few that had Renters insurance, thank goodness.",147,,
1356,0.97,7751.543,7752.778,But to have my insurance calm.,147,,
1357,0.97,7752.778,7756.415,"Get a claim, do the adjustment.",147,,
1358,0.97,7756.415,7759.685,And get a quote.,147,,
1359,0.97,7759.685,7762.921,"In the meantime, still getting robbed.",147,,
1360,0.97,7762.921,7770.662,"Like I literally could not figure out if I should get my stuff out before these people come, because I kept losing things.",147,,
1361,0.97,7770.662,7774.099,Or if I had to wait.,147,,
1362,0.97,7774.099,7774.733,I don't remember specifically.,147,,
1363,0.97,7774.733,7784.042,"I think it was four or five days after they finally had someone on the premises, allegedly 24 hours.",147,,
1364,0.97,7784.042,7794.353,"Though in our group, there have been many of us who have been visiting and discussing whether that person has been there or not.",147,,
1365,0.97,7794.353,7795.454,"Sometimes they are, sometimes they're not.",147,,
1366,0.97,7795.454,7799.958,"They also have fences up, but we have seen those fences down.",147,,
1367,0.97,7799.958,7803.996,We have documented evidence on that.,147,,
1368,0.97,7803.996,7808.7,"Even those Looters, they are Squatters now.",147,,
1369,0.97,7808.7,7814.706,Let's see what else.,147,,
1370,0.97,7814.706,7815.974,There was no alarms the whole time.,147,,
1371,0.97,7815.974,7821.246,I was utterly shocked.,147,,
1372,0.97,7821.246,7823.515,Something I didn't think about in the middle of it all.,147,,
1373,0.97,7823.515,7827.953,"Once I was outside, watching the fire, I could have died.",147,,
1374,0.97,7827.953,7829.121,Literally could have died.,147,,
1375,0.97,7829.121,7832.658,"And still, all of my stuff.",147,,
1376,0.97,7832.658,7837.095,It is hard to sleep.,147,,
1377,0.97,7837.095,7838.53,But it is getting better every day.,147,,
1378,0.97,7838.53,7840.132,"Anyway, it is still pretty traumatic for me.",147,,
1379,0.97,7840.132,7847.072,"So Yeah, thank you.",147,,
1380,0.97,7847.072,7847.873,"Thank you, Jesse.",148,,
1381,0.97,7847.873,7858.784,"Yes, I can imagine how traumatic that is and I think you made one of the important points you made, that there were no alarms for the fire.",148,,
1382,0.97,7858.784,7868.393,This was related to the housing code compliance.,148,,
1383,0.97,7868.393,7875.901,"Obviously this is already happened, but it is something we should look into, that they had that or not.",148,,
1384,0.97,7875.901,7886.878,"It demonstrates why we need, legally, to strengthen Seattle's municipal code to make sure After-the-fact landlords can be held liable.",148,,
1385,0.97,7886.878,7888.28,Did you want to make a point?,148,,
1386,0.97,7888.28,7892.951,I saw your hand up.,148,,
1387,0.97,7892.951,7903.929,"I had the opportunity to speak with some of Jesse's neighbors and he mentioned that he had Renters insurance, which was very helpful.",149,,
1388,0.97,7903.929,7910.836,"From talking to his neighbors, it sounds like four of the people in that building did have Renters insurance.",149,,
1389,0.97,7910.836,7922.014,"For people that didn't when the fire happened, suddenly they needed to find somewhere to stay.",149,,
1390,0.97,7922.014,7926.885,"So, for people had Renters insurance and were able to use that to find somewhere to stay.",149,,
1391,0.97,7926.885,7930.155,The majority of people did not.,149,,
1392,0.97,7930.155,7932.958,"They stayed with friends, family, coworkers.",149,,
1393,0.97,7932.958,7938.063,One person wound up living in their car.,149,,
1394,0.97,7938.063,7943.735,"Meanwhile, the property owner was holding onto their security deposits.",149,,
1395,0.97,7943.735,7951.677,Legally the property owner has 21 days to return the security deposit.,149,,
1396,0.97,7951.677,7964.723,"For the people who were displaced, trying to find a place to live, even if it is legal to hold that security deposit for 21 days, it is totally immoral to do that.",149,,
1397,0.97,7964.723,7972.998,"Especially since of people are trying to find somewhere to live, they need that money.",149,,
1398,0.97,7972.998,7984.176,But that ties back into using that as some sort of bargaining chip to try to get Renters to sign away their rights.,149,,
1399,0.97,7984.176,7990.248,Something that several Renters mentioned.,149,,
1400,0.97,7990.248,7990.749,Right.,150,,
1401,0.97,7990.749,7991.483,"Thanks so much, Ted.",150,,
1402,0.97,7991.483,7997.155,Obviously there is a lot to follow up on.,150,,
1403,0.97,7997.155,7999.391,We won't be able to do all of that today.,150,,
1404,0.97,7999.391,8006.565,"So I wanted to thank both the Sdci, who just presented, and also the Renters and Renters advocates who spoke today.",150,,
1405,0.97,8006.565,8022.18,"Some of you Renters advocates have been here before and my office continues to greatly appreciate your participation in these committee meetings, because your input is extremely important.",150,,
1406,0.97,8022.18,8025.417,"Even if you have been here before, your subsequent input is always extremely important.",150,,
1407,0.97,8025.417,8032.124,I appreciate you coming here.,150,,
1408,0.97,8032.124,8037.195,"And also for all of the work you have been doing, tenants Union, justice project, in advocating for Renters.",150,,
1409,0.97,8037.195,8056.081,Making my office aware of what improvements need to be made for Renters rights and also making us aware of specific situations where tenants want to fight back and get organized and there is somewhere we can provide some political and other assistance.,150,,
1410,0.97,8056.081,8059.551,"So, appreciate all of that.",150,,
1411,0.97,8059.551,8070.128,"I just wanted, in closing, I wanted to say on the case that Ellen Anderson described for roommates and themselves.",150,,
1412,0.97,8070.128,8078.203,"There are instances of landlords increasing rent and still not fixing bad conditions, as with the case described with no water for two years.",150,,
1413,0.97,8078.203,8085.544,"Also, in Ellen and her roommates case, Renters should not have to accept bad conditions just because rents are going up, either.",150,,
1414,0.97,8085.544,8097.322,"Either way we do need to push for increased ability for tenants to fight against bad conditions, whether rents are going up or not.",150,,
1415,0.97,8097.322,8109.301,"I would just close on the note that Kate Rubin made, which is that landlords are not really afraid of code violations.",150,,
1416,0.97,8109.301,8111.97,"What they will be afraid of is if Renters, throughout the city, got organized.",150,,
1417,0.97,8111.97,8116.441,"Demanded progressive change, like represented by this legislation we are discussing and also last year.",150,,
1418,0.97,8116.441,8122.347,Ultimately what we really need is rent control.,150,,
1419,0.97,8122.347,8139.331,"Citywide, strong rent control, and we need a massive expansion of publicly owned social housing, where you want to have private Profit-Making landlords, but it will be something that will belong to everyone and it will be administered by the city council.",150,,
1420,0.97,8139.331,8148.507,"That does not mean problems will automatically go away, but you will be able to hold the city accountable for all of that and that is going to be extremely important, as well.",150,,
1421,0.97,8148.507,8162.954,"For our third item, I wanted to invite Councilmember Pedersen to introduce this point and then of course we will talk about the process.",150,,
1422,0.97,8162.954,8163.755,Thank you so much.,150,,
1423,0.97,8163.755,8169.227,"Councilmember Pedersen, welcome.",150,,
1424,0.97,8169.227,8174.099,Thank you for inviting me to attend today's meeting as a sponsor of this proposal.,151,,
1425,0.97,8174.099,8183.074,"Council bill 120284, and for making time and space to refine this proposal in Committee at a later date.",151,,
1426,0.97,8183.074,8192.083,"Colleagues, this bill is needed to fill a hole in the data our city has had for the past several years with rental housing.",151,,
1427,0.97,8192.083,8203.194,"Finally filling that gap can provide several benefits, which include having the data needed to assess and prevent displacement of existing residence from a rapidly growing city.",151,,
1428,0.97,8203.194,8209.467,"Especially as executive departments continue their comprehensive planning process, as required by state law.",151,,
1429,0.97,8209.467,8224.082,"In addition to the draft bill, which is available today on the Online agenda, there is an informative summary and fiscal NOTE as well as a memo from central staff.",151,,
1430,0.97,8224.082,8230.188,I hope we hear from her as well today.,151,,
1431,0.97,8230.188,8238.096,"This bill is not ready to be voted on, but the information in those documents will be helpful to the general public as we consider amendments.",151,,
1432,0.97,8238.096,8240.131,Thanks to everyone who took time to call in today.,151,,
1433,0.97,8240.131,8243.568,We hear you.,151,,
1434,0.97,8243.568,8249.674,"For smaller landlords, think you for the housing you provide in my district and throughout the city.",151,,
1435,0.97,8249.674,8260.318,"I hope you know I have, in the past, worked hard to amend legislation to recognize your unique burdens, as well as the benefits of the housing you provide.",151,,
1436,0.97,8260.318,8262.487,"Which, based on anecdotal data, is often at or below market rent.",151,,
1437,0.97,8262.487,8268.159,That said I also heard comments today about the importance of detailed data.,151,,
1438,0.97,8268.159,8278.57,"As long as we move quickly, I am open to amendments to improve implementation of getting detailed data, that allow me to start today with the rationale for this data collection bill.",151,,
1439,0.97,8278.57,8292.35,"When I met with the previous director of a city Department that relies on housing data, I mentioned affordable housing in the University district that would be at risk of demolition and replacement with more expensive housing.",151,,
1440,0.97,8292.35,8300.258,If additional Land-Use changes were pursued without first putting into effect this place and prevention laws.,151,,
1441,0.97,8300.258,8305.163,"While recognizing the benefits, the previous director was not aware of those apartment buildings.",151,,
1442,0.97,8305.163,8311.436,"For example, they were not aware of the Pacific apartments, a 34 unit building.",151,,
1443,0.97,8311.436,8312.37,University Avenue.,151,,
1444,0.97,8312.37,8314.005,5200 block.,151,,
1445,0.97,8314.005,8323.248,"Several other affordable, Below- market, rental housing on the Avenue and throughout our city.",151,,
1446,0.97,8323.248,8333.425,"That is simply because our departments had been relying on a firm, Dupree and Scott, which is great.",151,,
1447,0.97,8333.425,8336.227,Did lots of data.,151,,
1448,0.97,8336.227,8343.935,They closed at the end of 2017 and since then departments have been relying mainly on census tract data that is too high- level and infrequent.,151,,
1449,0.97,8343.935,8354.713,We need block by block data on existing contract rents in place so we know what tenants are paying now and which buildings are naturally occurring affordable housing.,151,,
1450,0.97,8354.713,8363.621,"To clarify, this bill would not collect any personally identifiable information.",151,,
1451,0.97,8363.621,8372.397,"Now the Council adopted in November, 2020, a statement of legislative intent.",151,,
1452,0.97,8372.397,8376.968,It asked the executive to prepare a plan to fill the data gap.,151,,
1453,0.97,8376.968,8380.305,Several departments tried to work together.,151,,
1454,0.97,8380.305,8386.611,A year later they came back with a response that did not have an ideal solution to this problem.,151,,
1455,0.97,8386.611,8397.155,"To use the rental housing inspection ordinance, Rrio, that would require it be amended, hence this bill.",151,,
1456,0.97,8397.155,8409.134,"It's unfortunate the rental survey closed, but even that firm had gaps in information and shows you can't rely on a private survey firm.",151,,
1457,0.97,8409.134,8412.17,"For a growing city, we should have our own data.",151,,
1458,0.97,8412.17,8425.583,"While crafting the original rental ordinance was challenging several years ago, it has been in place for several years.",151,,
1459,0.97,8425.583,8427.018,Landlords already submitted a list of units.,151,,
1460,0.97,8427.018,8431.489,"I want to thank the landlords of over 30,000 properties already registered with Rrio.",151,,
1461,0.97,8431.489,8434.759,"Those contain about 150,000 units.",151,,
1462,0.97,8434.759,8448.74,"They are already complying by providing this list of units and they already produce their own list of rental units for their own bookkeeping, which include rents, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms.",151,,
1463,0.97,8448.74,8451.81,"In some cases, square footage and vacancy status.",151,,
1464,0.97,8451.81,8463.388,"In other words, Rrio as a vehicle can be an efficient way to have landlords submit their rental rate and occupancy data.",151,,
1465,0.97,8463.388,8469.26,"We have, however, received a lot of feedback and concerns about this new bill.",151,,
1466,0.97,8469.26,8472.297,"I am open to reasonable amendments, as long as there is not undue delay.",151,,
1467,0.97,8472.297,8478.636,But it was really helpful to have this bill aired today to get that input.,151,,
1468,0.97,8478.636,8488.146,Complete and accurate housing details before the city council makes major decisions during our comprehensive planning process next year.,151,,
1469,0.97,8488.146,8499.591,"While we don't yet know which research University the city Department would choose to receive and assess this data, my office has confirmed with the University of Washington center for real estate research.",151,,
1470,0.97,8499.591,8508.666,They offered to assemble a working group of housing providers to discuss the mechanics of proposed data collection.,151,,
1471,0.97,8508.666,8511.703,I would be open to that.,151,,
1472,0.97,8511.703,8516.174,"I also want to have tenant groups at the table, city Department representatives at the table.",151,,
1473,0.97,8516.174,8522.18,So we will need a few weeks to work out the implementation hurdles and craft any amendments.,151,,
1474,0.97,8522.18,8525.35,Get this approved I the city attorney's office.,151,,
1475,0.97,8525.35,8532.023,"I know we were hoping to do something on April 1. April 15, that might be too soon.",151,,
1476,0.97,8532.023,8538.93,"April 15 is Passover, so may six is when I would ask that the chair make more time available for us to come back.",151,,
1477,0.97,8538.93,8541.766,And I know it would be helpful.,151,,
1478,0.97,8541.766,8547.872,If my colleagues have questions.,151,,
1479,0.97,8547.872,8549.908,Asha is here from central staff to present her memo.,151,,
1480,0.97,8549.908,8552.543,She might end up answering those questions.,151,,
1481,0.97,8552.543,8557.849,"So, chair, I defer to you on what to do next.",151,,
1482,0.97,8561.452,8567.558,"Sorry, I was assuming Asha would come into make comments.",152,,
1483,0.97,8567.558,8572.463,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen, for that excellent description.",152,,
1484,0.97,8572.463,8575.7,"As I mentioned before, I definitely support this.",152,,
1485,0.97,8575.7,8575.9,Asha.,152,,
1486,0.97,8575.9,8582.006,"S, Asha Venkataraman, council central staff.",153,,
1487,0.97,8582.006,8587.278,If it works for you all I can go through and do a summary of the bill itself and then some of the issues to consider.,153,,
1488,0.97,8587.278,8592.15,For the committee to consider.,153,,
1489,0.97,8592.15,8595.787,And some potential amendments that might come up for the next committee discussion.,153,,
1490,0.97,8595.787,8608.833,"So, as Councilmember Pedersen mentioned, council bill 120284 would require property owners to submit specific rent and residential housing information to a research University, twice a year.",153,,
1491,0.97,8608.833,8626.684,"And its relationship to Rrio would be that they would have to submit a certification to the Seattle Department of construction and inspections under the Rrio program, that they had submitted that data to a research University.",153,,
1492,0.97,8626.684,8651.275,"The idea would be for a Department, either the office of community development for the Seattle Department of construction and inspections, maybe even the office of housing, to hold a contract with that research University that would detail all of the scope of information that the city is requesting for analysis, using the data that the property owners would submit.",153,,
1493,0.97,8651.275,8664.022,"As the bill is currently drafted, the intent is for a property owner to submit information about February of each year to the university, by March 31 of that year.",153,,
1494,0.97,8664.022,8671.529,"And again, information about the month of July, to the University by August 31.",153,,
1495,0.97,8671.529,8683.141,"As Councilmember Pedersen indicated, the intent is not for any personally identifiable information to be submitted.",153,,
1496,0.97,8683.141,8684.308,To the University.,153,,
1497,0.97,8684.308,8692.884,"So, specifically, property owners would be asked to submit a list of all the rental housing units on a property.",153,,
1498,0.97,8692.884,8697.355,Whether the unit is vacant or occupied.,153,,
1499,0.97,8697.355,8698.79,Net Rentable square footage for that unit.,153,,
1500,0.97,8698.79,8700.224,For those units.,153,,
1501,0.97,8700.224,8704.462,The number of bedrooms and bathrooms.,153,,
1502,0.97,8704.462,8711.803,"Information that reflects the net monthly residential rent and if utilities are included in rent, what that amount is.",153,,
1503,0.97,8711.803,8717.075,And the length of a rental agreement.,153,,
1504,0.97,8717.075,8730.288,"So, as Councilmember indicated, this information would all be used by the research University to provide information to the city to help inform housing policy, displacement indicators.",153,,
1505,0.97,8730.288,8737.395,Working to help the city make its updates to the comprehensive plan.,153,,
1506,0.97,8737.395,8743.234,"If there are no questions about the mechanics of the bill itself, I can move into some potential issues for the committee to consider.",153,,
1507,0.97,8743.234,8755.346,"So, first, excuse me, as I mentioned, either Opcd or another Department would need to contract with a research University.",153,,
1508,0.97,8755.346,8765.089,We have been in conversation with both Opcd and Sdci about which Department would be appropriate to hold that contract.,153,,
1509,0.97,8765.089,8773.731,"In general, they would coordinate between themselves and the office of housing to scope out what a contract might look like.",153,,
1510,0.97,8773.731,8777.135,And so I think either Opcd or Sdci would be appropriate to hold it.,153,,
1511,0.97,8777.135,8793.251,"Depending on what Councilmember preferences are and if the executive continues to provide information about which would be the appropriate Department, it may be worth amending the legislation to reflect which Department would hold the contract.",153,,
1512,0.97,8793.251,8800.925,"As it is currently drafted, the legislation refers to Opcd or another executive Department, so an amendment could clarify the issue.",153,,
1513,0.97,8800.925,8806.23,The next issue is one surrounding timing.,153,,
1514,0.97,8806.23,8822.914,"At this point, there are a couple of different issues that would need to be worked out, in terms of getting the information to the University and getting an analysis back.",153,,
1515,0.97,8822.914,8828.386,The first is that it takes time to negotiate a contract and to execute it.,153,,
1516,0.97,8828.386,8843.0,"So depending on--excuse me, I am sorry--depending on the amount of the contract, which could be anywhere from $50- $150,000 in the initial analysis.",153,,
1517,0.97,8843.0,8845.67,It sounds like that is how much it would be.,153,,
1518,0.97,8845.67,8864.355,"There is the potential for discussion around whether the Department could directly contract with an entity like the University of Washington or if it would need to go through a competitive bidding office and issue an Rfp, request for proposals, and to that level of work.",153,,
1519,0.97,8864.355,8870.228,It is possible that that contract negotiation and execution could take some time.,153,,
1520,0.97,8870.228,8883.441,It may be worth the committee considering at what point property owner should be required to submit their information to a university.,153,,
1521,0.97,8883.441,8898.889,"Given the way the bill is currently drafted, if property Ownrs would have to submit information about the month of July, by August 31, that would mean the contract with whatever University is going to be analyzing this data, would have to be completed by August 31.",153,,
1522,0.97,8898.889,8902.927,So property owners would know which University they were submitting information to.,153,,
1523,0.97,8902.927,8916.54,"So, pending further conversations with the departments about what a Timeline might look like, and may be worth adjusting some of the Timelines around when that information should be submitted.",153,,
1524,0.97,8916.54,8926.317,"Another issue that comes up is the funding for the contract, as well as potential funding for enforcement.",153,,
1525,0.97,8926.317,8943.067,"Given that this legislation is coming up after budget decisions for 2022 have already been made, there needs to be continuing discussion about whether there are funds available to Reprioritize for this purpose.",153,,
1526,0.97,8943.067,8950.675,Assuming that a contract would be executed in 2022.,153,,
1527,0.97,8950.675,8954.712,It's not clear that either of the departments have funding they would be able to Prioritize for this.,153,,
1528,0.97,8954.712,8966.123,"I don't Believethere is existing extra funding, especially given the current conversations about general fund challenges moving into 2023.",153,,
1529,0.97,8966.123,8976.167,"The other issue, other than the contract cost itself, would be any funding that is necessary for Sdci to monitor compliance.",153,,
1530,0.97,8976.167,8977.501,"Staffing and resource, as well as I.T.",153,,
1531,0.97,8977.501,8986.043,"Issues, could be minimal, if all Sdci is doing is tracking whether a certification has been submitted to them.",153,,
1532,0.97,8986.043,8998.222,"However, the intent of the Council is for a more robust set of enforcement, which would look at if the information submitted to the University itself was accurate.",153,,
1533,0.97,8998.222,9000.624,That could take a lot more time and resources.,153,,
1534,0.97,9000.624,9012.837,"So it may be worth further conversations, both with the Department and in committee about what the scope of enforcement on this piece of legislation might look like.",153,,
1535,0.97,9012.837,9023.214,"The last piece of the funding conversation is that even if--excuse me, I'm sorry.",153,,
1536,0.97,9023.214,9039.263,"Even if funding were found to support the contract and enforcement in 2022, there would need to be conversations during the budget discussions for 2023 that would provide ongoing funds for a contract with a research University.",153,,
1537,0.97,9039.263,9053.911,"So it is both a conversation about how to implement this legislation and then assuming that is not ongoing funding, what that looks like in 2023 and beyond.",153,,
1538,0.97,9053.911,9058.816,I will move into what potential amendments might look like.,153,,
1539,0.97,9058.816,9072.797,"As Councilmember Pedersen mentioned, if this moves forward on May 6, there is time between now and that time for Councilmembers to discuss more amendments.",153,,
1540,0.97,9072.797,9080.938,Councilmember Pedersen is considering amendments already for potential discussion.,153,,
1541,0.97,9080.938,9087.678,"The first would ensure that Nobodies contact information, personally identifiable information, would be submitted to a university.",153,,
1542,0.97,9087.678,9099.557,"Right of the legislation refers to a tenants information not being reported, so the potential amendment would add that the property owner's information also would not be included in the information required for submission to the University.",153,,
1543,0.97,9099.557,9109.767,The second would be to adjust the scope of the work to be done for the University.,153,,
1544,0.97,9109.767,9112.203,Right now the legislation mentions reporting about displacement.,153,,
1545,0.97,9112.203,9123.18,"So a potential amendment, excuse me, would broaden that scope to say information about the rental housing market conditions in general.",153,,
1546,0.97,9123.18,9128.185,Just so that it could account for both displacement as well as market conditions.,153,,
1547,0.97,9128.185,9145.136,"And Lastly, this goes to one of the issues that I mentioned for the committee's consideration, adjusting the dates that a property owner could, would submit, information about their rent and residential units.",153,,
1548,0.97,9145.136,9163.187,"So instead of submitting information about February by March 31, the potential amendment would revise those dates for submission April 15, for March information.",153,,
1549,0.97,9163.187,9172.73,"And then instead of August 31 for July information, move that to be reporting by October 15 for September information.",153,,
1550,0.97,9172.73,9185.543,"As far as implications in 2022, it would allow departments more time to negotiate and execute contracts for a First-Round of information to come in later in the year.",153,,
1551,0.97,9185.543,9198.556,"Instead of having to submit by August 31, they would look at October 15, which provides an additional month and a half, if that does allow sufficient time to be able to negotiate and execute contracts.",153,,
1552,0.97,9198.556,9207.064,I will leave it at that and I am happy to answer any questions that any Councilmembers might have.,153,,
1553,0.97,9207.064,9207.865,"Thank you, Asha.",154,,
1554,0.97,9207.865,9211.135,I don't see any hands up yet.,154,,
1555,0.97,9211.135,9214.805,"Councilmember Pedersen, did you want to come in again?",154,,
1556,0.97,9214.805,9219.043,I can close it out.,155,,
1557,0.97,9219.043,9223.714,"Councilmember Nelson, go ahead.",156,,
1558,0.97,9223.714,9227.084,"Thank you, very much.",157,,
1559,0.97,9227.084,9231.021,Councilmember Pedersen.,157,,
1560,0.97,9231.021,9240.998,I share your desire to get a sense of the displacement in actually affordable housing.,157,,
1561,0.97,9240.998,9244.602,We need to know that for many reasons.,157,,
1562,0.97,9244.602,9262.119,"And because, Sdci rental registration inspection ordinance annual report that Council received on August 5, that was about, it was reporting on 2020.",157,,
1563,0.97,9262.119,9272.463,"Notes that by the end of the year, total registrations decreased, registrations into the program, decreased by 14.4% from 2019.",157,,
1564,0.97,9272.463,9274.298,That is over the course of a year.,157,,
1565,0.97,9274.298,9279.403,But the total number of units stayed relatively stable.,157,,
1566,0.97,9279.403,9293.617,"The difference between units and actual renewals of properties indicates that the apartments or the units that were already built, stayed in the system and were counted.",157,,
1567,0.97,9293.617,9295.452,They did not decrease.,157,,
1568,0.97,9295.452,9313.537,"But the fact that the actual properties we are talking about, the renewals in the program, indicates to me that it is the small Mom-And-Pop landlords that are basically not, they are taking properties off the market.",157,,
1569,0.97,9313.537,9323.447,I looked at the 2018 University of Washington study.,157,,
1570,0.97,9323.447,9324.114,It was the previous.,157,,
1571,0.97,9324.114,9327.151,"It was the Seattle rental housing study final report, published in June, 2018.",157,,
1572,0.97,9327.151,9340.331,"It surveys landlords and one line caught my attention, which is basically--let's see.",157,,
1573,0.97,9340.331,9351.275,"It notes--well, landlords frustration with the first in time and other laws that Council past.",157,,
1574,0.97,9351.275,9365.089,It basically says about 40% of landlords sold or plan to sell property in response to city ordinances governing the market.,157,,
1575,0.97,9365.089,9368.025,Three years have passed since then and there have been more recent regulations.,157,,
1576,0.97,9368.025,9371.595,So I think that we do need to document this.,157,,
1577,0.97,9371.595,9381.371,And my interest is in making sure that we are not driving small landlords out of the market.,157,,
1578,0.97,9381.371,9390.347,"When they take properties or sell property, it is Redeveloped for Market-Based rent, oftentimes.",157,,
1579,0.97,9390.347,9397.054,I understand that your Timeline is based around upcoming zoning decisions that will be made.,157,,
1580,0.97,9397.054,9431.789,"My whole point is, is it possible, and maybe we should talk about this off-line, but get a point in time study, because it seems as though the trend data that you are looking for, over time by the ongoing reporting, might not, that is ongoing, but this information--so I am just wondering if you have considered a point in time study instead of an ongoing reporting.",157,,
1581,0.97,9431.789,9436.527,Function.,157,,
1582,0.97,9436.527,9441.799,And also may be pushing it to 2023.,157,,
1583,0.97,9441.799,9443.6,"And then I happen to know, one last thing.",157,,
1584,0.97,9443.6,9451.542,"When I was reading this report, it mentioned, I know that Dupree and Scott closing their office has been a big detriment to us.",157,,
1585,0.97,9451.542,9455.412,"Getting this information, we are all on the same page about that.",157,,
1586,0.97,9455.412,9459.45,But it mentions the Ronstadt center for real estate.,157,,
1587,0.97,9459.45,9468.992,"Also a potential--you know, maybe, you know, source, of research.",157,,
1588,0.97,9468.992,9470.427,"Information, you know.",157,,
1589,0.97,9470.427,9474.298,"So, that's it.",157,,
1590,0.97,9474.298,9477.935,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",158,,
1591,0.97,9477.935,9484.675,"You know, we don't know which University would do it.",158,,
1592,0.97,9484.675,9493.383,"Even within the same University, it could be a different Department that could do it.",158,,
1593,0.97,9493.383,9507.798,"And in terms of whether to do it one time, point in time, versus ongoing, I definitely see the benefits of having it ongoing, so we know what the trends are and we have to do a plan again.",158,,
1594,0.97,9507.798,9511.268,In the future.,158,,
1595,0.97,9511.268,9513.904,So it would be nice if we were more ready this time.,158,,
1596,0.97,9513.904,9522.646,At least with that piece of rental housing data.,158,,
1597,0.97,9522.646,9535.058,"The other thing is that I think we are so far behind on this in a way, because there are other policy documents that the city has approved, stating that we want to prevent displacement.",158,,
1598,0.97,9535.058,9538.428,That one of the ways of doing that is having better data.,158,,
1599,0.97,9538.428,9541.131,Having granular data.,158,,
1600,0.97,9541.131,9545.402,Nobody has that right now.,158,,
1601,0.97,9545.402,9551.275,"So we have to do something now to get that level of specificity, block by block.",158,,
1602,0.97,9551.275,9566.723,"On where the actually affordable housing is, so we go in with eyes wide open on how we will change Land-Use or anything else around where those properties are located.",158,,
1603,0.97,9566.723,9577.501,"I mean, it could be where we set it up to be ongoing and then maybe we realize we don't need it or make a change later.",158,,
1604,0.97,9577.501,9582.773,But I know my colleagues are also interested in having this ongoing.,158,,
1605,0.97,9582.773,9586.009,So we can talk about that further.,158,,
1606,0.97,9586.009,9591.114,Thanks for putting that on the table as an idea.,158,,
1607,0.97,9591.114,9596.586,"Sure, and not super invested in the outcome of that discussion.",159,,
1608,0.97,9596.586,9603.961,"I just, while I have you, I know, didn't Council advocate money for another rental housing study last budget cycle?",159,,
1609,0.97,9603.961,9605.529,What's up with that?,159,,
1610,0.97,9605.529,9609.8,I could be completely wrong.,159,,
1611,0.97,9609.8,9610.601,I don't know.,160,,
1612,0.97,9610.601,9615.072,I don't know if it was this level of specificity.,160,,
1613,0.97,9615.072,9625.382,"One of the problems is what is readily available is information from the American community survey, but it does not give us the block to block information.",160,,
1614,0.97,9625.382,9631.121,Sometimes rental studies are based also on what they would be charging for a unit today.,160,,
1615,0.97,9631.121,9643.734,"We are interested also in what are they paying right now, that there are tenants there right now paying potentially below market, unregulated, below market rate rent, which is great.",160,,
1616,0.97,9643.734,9645.335,We just don't know where that is.,160,,
1617,0.97,9645.335,9650.841,I completely agree with the value of needing to know that.,161,,
1618,0.97,9650.841,9655.912,"So, thank you.",161,,
1619,0.97,9660.35,9672.362,I just had a few points about this legislation and the proposed legislation and Councilmember Pedersen will close this item out and then we will adjourn.,162,,
1620,0.97,9672.362,9680.904,"Just very quickly, Yeah, I mean, just to be clear, this is just collecting data.",162,,
1621,0.97,9680.904,9694.284,This is not putting any monetary burden on landlords of any kind.,162,,
1622,0.97,9694.284,9708.865,"I just wanted to echo Kate Rubins point, that when you become a landlord, you are signing up for doing the paperwork, just like tenants have to do paperwork in order to be able to rent a particular unit.",162,,
1623,0.97,9708.865,9718.275,"Also, just on the point in time data, as an economist I am all for data.",162,,
1624,0.97,9718.275,9720.343,"If we get point in time data, that's also great.",162,,
1625,0.97,9720.343,9726.55,"But just to clarify, point in time data will not actually give you any information on trends.",162,,
1626,0.97,9726.55,9737.594,"If the goal is to look at trends, and I agree with that goal, which is why I am supporting this legislation, then you have to have it ongoing.",162,,
1627,0.97,9737.594,9739.029,Otherwise it will not give you that information.,162,,
1628,0.97,9739.029,9753.844,"I also wanted to say that Councilmember Nelson is basically reiterating the landlord assertion, which we have heard many times, that supposedly Renters rights being strengthened in the city is driving small landlords out of the market.",162,,
1629,0.97,9753.844,9759.149,That is just total speculation.,162,,
1630,0.97,9759.149,9760.751,There is no documentary evidence to support it.,162,,
1631,0.97,9760.751,9763.587,That is a claim by landlords.,162,,
1632,0.97,9763.587,9764.588,Nobody else is claiming that.,162,,
1633,0.97,9764.588,9770.527,The reality is that property values are skyrocketing.,162,,
1634,0.97,9770.527,9780.871,Our landlord selling because they don't want to comply or because property values have gone through the roof and they can cash in on their property like never before?,162,,
1635,0.97,9780.871,9784.307,"It's totally their right and if they are selling their property, that's their decision.",162,,
1636,0.97,9784.307,9787.01,But connecting it to increased Renters rights is not appropriate.,162,,
1637,0.97,9787.01,9794.518,"I have no doubt many landlords don't like increased Renters rights, but it's not about what they like or don't like.",162,,
1638,0.97,9794.518,9803.827,"It's about having a city that actually has bare minimum standards, let alone anything better, but bare minimum standards for how Renters are treated and we are not there yet.",162,,
1639,0.97,9803.827,9809.933,"I don't think anybody can claim too much, other than landlords.",162,,
1640,0.97,9809.933,9814.004,"Again, I have never heard anybody claiming that.",162,,
1641,0.97,9814.004,9825.982,"I also wanted to add that the data that landlords are Referencing, landlords who don't want even this kind of reporting are Referencing a number of Llcs.",162,,
1642,0.97,9825.982,9838.562,"The property owner of the building that was gutted by fire that we just had testimony on, one of the tenants, owns a dozen Llcs and each building is its own company.",162,,
1643,0.97,9838.562,9840.831,"So you know, we have to keep that in mind as well.",162,,
1644,0.97,9840.831,9845.468,That is a common thing for corporations and big landlords to do.,162,,
1645,0.97,9845.468,9853.443,"Lastly, I want to clarify that this term of naturally occurring affordable housing comes up.",162,,
1646,0.97,9853.443,9862.018,It is economist jargon.,162,,
1647,0.97,9862.018,9879.169,"It basically means that it is housing that is generally at or below 30% of a potential tenants income, because that is the rule of thumb for Affordability but it is not naturally occurring in the sense that it does not just exist by itself in the world.",162,,

1649,0.97,9895.185,9904.494,"How much social housing that is and how much privately owned housing that is, that is entirely a question of the political balance of forces and tenants need to fight for increased social housing.",162,,
