16,0.97,49089.006,49093.911,And then the two positions that are appointed by the board members themselves.,2,,
17,0.97,49093.911,49096.313,During this meeting.,2,,
18,0.97,49096.313,49102.853,We will continue the discussion on several matters that are related to rising rent.,2,,
19,0.97,49102.853,49115.332,"And it's important that we note that because in the last two months, we put forward several bills related to elections and minimizing and Elimin Evictions.",2,,
20,0.97,49115.332,49118.569,But we know there are other problems faced not just the skyrocketing rent.,2,,
21,0.97,49118.569,49124.341,So we will hear from the panel of Renters for insight on rising rents in our community.,2,,
22,0.97,49124.341,49137.688,"And importantly, Council members will have the opportunity to ask questions, discuss or indicate.",2,,
23,0.97,49137.688,49148.966,"The first is Landloerpds to provide relocation assistance when they displace their tenants, with outrageous increases.",2,,
24,0.97,49148.966,49158.476,"Over the past decade there, is massive displacement of our neighborhoods, force thousands from their home, neighborhood, and often even the city.",2,,
25,0.97,49158.476,49170.488,Some become homeless according to national recognized studies that show that every hundred dollar increase in a city results in a 15% increase in homelessness in.,2,,
26,0.97,49170.488,49181.232,"Seattle when those replaced by redevelopment are eligible for relocation assistance, but Renters are forced to move by rent increases.",2,,
27,0.97,49181.232,49188.939,And all the same costs of having to move to a new apartment get nothing.,2,,
28,0.97,49188.939,49191.842,"The bill from our office, economic displacement relocation assistance ordinance.",2,,
29,0.97,49191.842,49202.119,Bit of a mouthful but it's very important for Renters.,2,,
30,0.97,49202.119,49216.967,Will help Renters when they are forced to move by 10% or more.,2,,
31,0.97,49216.967,49223.974,I have Includ today's agenda that legislation.,2,,
32,0.97,49223.974,49231.582,Council members on the public can be confident the bill on today's agenda will be that is being sent for introduction.,2,,
33,0.97,49231.582,49248.399,"And I would greatly appreciate it if Council members and those with the bills, teachers, the technical aspects of the legislation, and felt free to ask questions to our marketing Council staff who is available here to answer any questions.",2,,
34,0.97,49248.399,49252.803,The next thing we'll discuss is the rent control.,2,,
35,0.97,49252.803,49253.27,Legislation.,2,,
36,0.97,49253.27,49254.939,From our office.,2,,
37,0.97,49254.939,49263.013,That bill is being reviewed by the city attorney's office.,2,,
38,0.97,49263.013,49272.356,Wean that Renters cannot simply sit back and accept that Washington state's Democrats and Republicans will continue to ban rent control for the next 40 years.,2,,
39,0.97,49272.356,49287.171,As they have done for the previous 40.,2,,
40,0.97,49296.347,49314.465,The rent control legislation from my office has what is called a conditional effective date.,2,,
41,0.97,49319.937,49323.04,Alongside the Combangz of publicly owned affordable housing.,2,,
42,0.97,49323.04,49328.112,"If the Council passes the rent control legislation from my office, state lawmakers will no longer be able to ignore the issue.",2,,
43,0.97,49328.112,49337.888,We have no doubt in our minds that it will be a tremendous pressure for them.,2,,
44,0.97,49337.888,49348.432,To repeal that unfair ban.,2,,
45,0.97,49361.345,49380.064,"As always the Renter's Commission for being so actively engaged and making very strong recommendation like this one, and like the Renter Evictions ban which they have put forward and the council passed more than a year ago.",2,,
46,0.97,49380.064,49382.833,This spill Unfortunately a little more confusing than it needs to be.,2,,
47,0.97,49382.833,49393.744,Simply because of the way the city of Seattle tracks legislation.,2,,
48,0.97,49393.744,49407.024,"If members of the public read what is listed on the agenda without the changes, it is simply showing you what the bill actually does without filling your screen with the technical amendments.",2,,
49,0.97,49407.024,49414.865,We also bring a six-month notice for rent increases and the assistance Bims for a vote at our next committee meeting which is a regularly scheduled meeting.,2,,
50,0.97,49414.865,49419.67,And I hope we will have a full attendance there on July 27th.,2,,
51,0.97,49419.67,49429.847,"If committee members are ready to vote, feel free to ask any questions or concerns about the bill that you might have.",2,,
52,0.97,49429.847,49435.185,"And as always, before we begin our agenda item, we have public comment.",2,,
53,0.97,49435.185,49441.759,We have 20 people signed up for public comment.,2,,
54,0.97,49441.759,49443.026,I will read each person's name.,2,,
55,0.97,49443.026,49449.066,And each person will have one minute to speak because we have a full agenda.,2,,
56,0.97,49449.066,49451.668,And we have several people signed up for public comment.,2,,
57,0.97,49451.668,49457.274,So the first person signed up is Daniel Cavanaugh.,2,,
58,0.97,49457.274,49459.109,"Followed by Hunter Saboda, and Jessica Sauza.",2,,
59,0.97,49459.109,49461.311,"Go ahead, Daniel.",2,,
60,0.97,49461.311,49463.347,"Hi, my name is Dan.",3,,
61,0.97,49463.347,49466.45,I'm a member of Socialist alternative and a Renter.,3,,
62,0.97,49466.45,49474.258,And I'm urging all the Council members to support the Renters' rights bill from house member Sawant.,3,,
63,0.97,49474.258,49479.43,First is a bill requiring Landloerpds to provide six-month notice for rent increases.,3,,
64,0.97,49479.43,49487.171,And the second bill mandating that landlords provide relocation assistance in the economic effect or raise the rent that people have to move.,3,,
65,0.97,49487.171,49510.127,"And I want to thank the rent style Renters, the advocacy organizations, for Progressive unions like UAW and FDA, organizations like the Washington community action network, the housing justice project, Socialist alternative, and Council member Sawant for making serious progress on getting a full Renters' bill of rights for our city.",3,,
66,0.97,49510.127,49516.567,We know this crisis is only deepening and not letting up.,3,,
67,0.97,49516.567,49524.007,Seattle landlords raise Rentance average of 18.7% since January of this year.,3,,
68,0.97,49524.007,49525.342,Double the average rate of increase nationally.,3,,
69,0.97,49525.342,49526.476,We need to fight.,3,,
70,0.97,49526.476,49535.052,And I urge Renters to join us September 18th at 4:00 PM in Cal Anderson Park for our rent control now rally.,3,,
71,0.97,49535.052,49539.523,"Next we have Anna Saboda, followed by Jessica Scalzo.",4,,
72,0.97,49539.523,49539.89,"Go ahead, Anna.",4,,
73,0.97,49543.994,49548.665,"Hi, my name is Anna Saboda and I'm a Renter in district 3.",5,,
74,0.97,49548.665,49557.074,I'm calling in to urge all Council members to support those two Renters rights bills from committee chair member Sawant.,5,,
75,0.97,49557.074,49563.78,Especially the one where landlords provide assistance when they displace their tenants with outrageous rent increases.,5,,
76,0.97,49563.78,49578.028,"When Renters are displaced because of massive rental increases, that's an economic exchange.",5,,
77,0.97,49578.028,49586.77,"We've also heard from so-called small housing providers, saying that the Renter projection would be disastrous for small landlords.",5,,
78,0.97,49586.77,49592.342,"However, playing the corporate Shell game, ten separate LLC's doesn't make you a small housing provide.",5,,
79,0.97,49592.342,49596.079,It makes you a standard corporate landlord.,5,,
80,0.97,49596.079,49599.616,So it's not small Landloerpds who are raising rent.,5,,
81,0.97,49599.616,49603.921,"It's the corporate landlords, the Slumlords who Price-Gouge the tenants.",5,,
82,0.97,49603.921,49610.827,"If you put 7% rental increases in Seattle, which is totally ridiculous, small Landloerpds would not be affected by these bills.",5,,
83,0.97,49610.827,49617.501,And I appreciate the small landlords who have been coming out to defend Renters' rights.,5,,
84,0.97,49617.501,49622.172,Jessica followed by Corey brewer.,6,,
85,0.97,49622.172,49624.341,And then Desean Byrd go.,6,,
86,0.97,49624.341,49625.275,"Ahead, Jess Kachlt",6,,
87,0.97,49625.275,49628.345,"Hi, my name is Jessica.",7,,
88,0.97,49628.345,49630.247,And I am a Renter in district three.,7,,
89,0.97,49630.247,49634.952,I've been a Renter in district three for 12 years.,7,,
90,0.97,49634.952,49638.855,"And before that, a Renter in district four.",7,,
91,0.97,49638.855,49644.428,And I'm calling in my support for the legislation that Council member Sawanlt has put forward.,7,,
92,0.97,49644.428,49651.768,To make sure that landlords give at least six months notice to raise their rent and also the legislation paid relocation assistance.,7,,
93,0.97,49651.768,49657.908,"I have been pushed out by my rent, which was more than doubled.",7,,
94,0.97,49657.908,49664.381,And we only got relocation assistance because there was--they had to redo all the pipes in the building.,7,,
95,0.97,49664.381,49665.382,And it helped a great amount.,7,,
96,0.97,49665.382,49668.852,So I thank you is important that everyone should have access to.,7,,
97,0.97,49668.852,49679.763,And also that it takes a lot of time to look for an apartment.,7,,
98,0.97,49679.763,49683.734,And it also takes a lot of money because of credit checks and so forth.,7,,
99,0.97,49683.734,49685.602,So I highly support both of these pieces of legislation.,7,,
100,0.97,49685.602,49687.404,And also the rent control bill.,7,,
101,0.97,49687.404,49689.94,And I'm encouraging all committee members to support the bill as well and vote for them.,7,,
102,0.97,49689.94,49694.111,Thank you.,7,,
103,0.97,49694.111,49697.781,"Next we have Corey brewer, followed by Esean burns and Karen Taylor go.",8,,
104,0.97,49697.781,49698.181,"Ahead, Cory.",8,,
105,0.97,49704.654,49707.09,"Hi, thank you.",9,,

107,0.97,49709.292,49713.53,Primarily representing the small mom and pop housing provider community.,9,,
108,0.97,49713.53,49719.503,So I wanted to provide some context about the cost of providing and maintaining rental housing.,9,,
109,0.97,49719.503,49729.179,I heard one of the candidates running for Mayor recently explained that a mortgage is a form of 30-year rent control for a homeowner.,9,,
110,0.97,49729.179,49731.114,I did some research.,9,,
111,0.97,49731.114,49737.354,I looked up a handful of our clients in Seattle at random to track their property tax increases.,9,,
112,0.97,49737.354,49754.137,Here's a list of some of the Year-Over-Year percentage increases that I found.,9,,
113,0.97,49756.306,49756.44,10.4%.,9,,
114,0.97,49756.44,49759.109,11.3%.,9,,

121,0.97,49760.677,49767.818,I have invited everyone on the Council via E-mail to participate in conversation about this with my office.,9,,
122,0.97,49767.818,49768.952,I'd like to invite you again.,9,,
123,0.97,49768.952,49775.892,It doesn't seem like you're interested in hearing from a panel.,9,,
124,0.97,49775.892,49786.369,Housing provider providers.,9,,
125,0.97,49811.528,49821.438,To purchase housing providers who may deny the outrageous increases.,10,,
126,0.97,49821.438,49831.615,"The point mentioned by the earlier Commenter, rents raised by the average Seattle landlord 18.7% since June.",10,,
127,0.97,49831.615,49840.724,"If that process continued over the whole year, that would be a 40% increase, outpacing the 25%.",10,,
128,0.97,49840.724,49848.298,"So this is gonNA increase, people are gonNA get forced out of their homes.",10,,
129,0.97,49848.298,49849.199,Encouraging the process of Gentrification.,10,,
130,0.97,49849.199,49853.17,Which is something I encourage you to help stop by supporting this legislation.,10,,
131,0.97,49853.17,49856.84,Next is Karen Taylor.,11,,
132,0.97,49856.84,49858.074,Followed by Barbara Freem and Dwight Solano.,11,,
133,0.97,49871.555,49882.365,"My name's Karen Taylor, and I'm calling in to giving some Heads-Up about rent increases.",12,,
134,0.97,49882.365,49887.103,I'm very happy that the Six-Term lease recall has been closed.,12,,
135,0.97,49887.103,49890.207,That's an enormous relief in my life.,12,,
136,0.97,49890.207,49894.911,"As this legislation came through, I realized you could still get rid of me with economic Eviction.",12,,
137,0.97,49894.911,49897.547,And it takes me months and months to find a place if I can.,12,,
138,0.97,49897.547,49916.7,"So it seems like Oh, Yeah, that's a common sense for me to be able to prepare for that process.",12,,
139,0.97,49919.336,49921.638,So thanks for proposing this legislation.,12,,
140,0.97,49921.638,49923.874,"Barbara, followed by Dwight Solano, and Matthew Smith.",13,,

142,0.97,49929.246,49937.754,My husband and I are longtime homeowners.,14,,
143,0.97,49937.754,49943.393,Seattle rents rose 9% from January to April.,14,,
144,0.97,49943.393,49948.632,And annualized percent of 40%.,14,,
145,0.97,49948.632,49956.072,And I would say to the man that's Disingenuous to compare it to a rental increase.,14,,
146,0.97,49956.072,49971.855,I stand in solidarity with Renters and urge the Seattle city Council to stand with working class Renters.,14,,
147,0.97,49971.855,49979.029,Require landlords to give six months notice to raise rents and provide assistance when they force tenants to move because of a big rent increase.,14,,

152,0.97,50007.023,50012.729,Seattle law only requires landlords to give tenants two months notice for rent increases.,16,,
153,0.97,50012.729,50020.603,The staggering pace of rent increase means that thousands will be forced to move.,16,,
154,0.97,50020.603,50026.209,And two months notice isn't enough.,16,,
155,0.97,50026.209,50033.316,Especially in light cost Vid debt.,16,,
156,0.97,50033.316,50040.69,Especially given that Seattle landlords raise rent an average of 18.7% between January and June.,16,,
157,0.97,50040.69,50046.796,"Which will cost a typical Seattle Renter an additional $3,300 a year.",16,,
158,0.97,50046.796,50054.904,"It's critical that we pass this legislation now and continue fighting for more Renters' protections, including residential and commercial rent control.",16,,

165,0.97,50076.326,50081.031,My lease is about to come up in two months.,18,,
166,0.97,50081.031,50084.3,And it is not enough for working people to plan to move.,18,,
167,0.97,50084.3,50091.207,I had to move after my last from the central district where my housing was.,18,,
168,0.97,50091.207,50096.179,Luxury housing that I couldn't afford.,18,,
169,0.97,50096.179,50105.321,And a Commenter earlier said that people rent back in 2017 nearly half of Seattle Renters were paying over a third of their income in rent.,18,,
170,0.97,50105.321,50106.823,And income burdens.,18,,
171,0.97,50106.823,50119.836,"And that is a huge, huge struggle for working people when they're told two months before their lease is up they have to come up with that extra money to pay that rent for next month or face the huge costs of moving.",18,,
172,0.97,50119.836,50120.603,I support this legislation.,18,,

180,0.97,50176.392,50191.774,"It really seems rent Eviction comes from those small company, not from individual family owners.",20,,

239,0.97,50501.317,50506.455,And affordable housing is going to become an even greater crisis.,32,,

242,0.97,50513.429,50517.8,The human need for housing can't just be used as the latest cash cow for investors.,32,,
243,0.97,50517.8,50519.836,And that's what I support now.,32,,
244,0.97,50519.836,50535.351,"I also support returning land to displaced communities, with the new hope missionary Baptist church proposal to build 78 unit was affordable housing for black special district communities.",32,,

247,0.97,50540.056,50543.292,And it's now worth millions and millions of dollars.,32,,

254,0.97,50569.252,50571.687,The pandemic's not over.,34,,
255,0.97,50571.687,50578.794,We're seeing corporate Landloerpds already started pushing up land at 2.5 times the national average which is really shocking.,34,,
256,0.97,50578.794,50584.333,And it is looking unlikely that my children will ever move out of the house with the skyrocketing rent.,34,,
257,0.97,50584.333,50587.77,And I think that should be deeply troubling to many people.,34,,
258,0.97,50587.77,50591.707,And nobody else has answers to this Besides Council member Sawant.,34,,
259,0.97,50591.707,50595.544,This is really illustrating why we need rent control.,34,,
260,0.97,50595.544,50603.185,"As a landlord, that doesn't scare me because it's the corporate landlords and Slumlords who keep jacking up rent by more than 10%.",34,,
261,0.97,50603.185,50605.788,So please pass rent control.,34,,
262,0.97,50605.788,50622.972,So we can Preemptively avoid those unintended consequences.,34,,

267,0.97,50661.143,50667.016,Moving belongings over two years isn't viable for elderly neighbors.,35,,
268,0.97,50667.016,50672.788,They're just one of many examples of why we need this six-month notice of rent HIKES.,35,,

275,0.97,50708.924,50709.859,Hello.,37,,
276,0.97,50709.859,50710.96,My name is Marlene Marsh.,37,,
277,0.97,50710.96,50715.865,I am a public high school teacher and have been a public high school teacher for over 20 years.,37,,
278,0.97,50715.865,50721.804,"My partner and I have a modest home with an Adu, which we have rented for Below-Market value for many years.",37,,
279,0.97,50721.804,50723.839,We're concerned about the current proposals.,37,,
280,0.97,50723.839,50727.543,We strongly believe in rent control and having affordable housing.,37,,
281,0.97,50727.543,50739.588,"However, we would like the Council to consider to please identify and distinguish between corporate and Multiunit landowners versus the single-family homeowners when you apply these new rules.",37,,
282,0.97,50739.588,50742.425,You're comparing a David and a Goliath.,37,,
283,0.97,50742.425,50746.462,This is not what the Council is aiming to do.,37,,
284,0.97,50746.462,50747.663,This is my opinion.,37,,
285,0.97,50747.663,50757.206,But I definitely believe this would hurt the rental market as the Davids would not be able to support renting units with such draconian measures.,37,,
286,0.97,50757.206,50763.512,"We would like the proposals to be fair and just for single families, homeowners such as ourselves.",37,,
287,0.97,50763.512,50767.65,"Who support our tenant, and share the property with them.",37,,

293,0.97,50795.945,50799.982,My members oppose the 180-Day notice to increase rent.,39,,
294,0.97,50799.982,50807.289,This bill will directly and significantly impact Railriders that rely on the housing that our members provide in your community.,39,,
295,0.97,50807.289,50823.439,A 180-Day notice for rental increase doesn't allow housing providers to match the increased costs of providing housing.,39,,
296,0.97,50868.317,50874.19,"My name is Gabriel, I'm a Temp worker and resident and Renter in the central district.",40,,

298,0.97,50886.135,50891.04,Our whole apartment building was recently bought by another corporate manager.,40,,
299,0.97,50891.04,50902.585,And all of the resident in the 40-Plus units are totally anxious about how much their rent is gonNA go up or not go up.,40,,
300,0.97,50902.585,50907.356,Because we know that the new management company has aspirations with how much they can get.,40,,
301,0.97,50907.356,50912.895,"For many of us, we're just not clear if we can continue to stay in our units or not.",40,,
302,0.97,50912.895,50915.631,And this 180 days notice is just a No-Brainer.,40,,
303,0.97,50915.631,50922.671,I haven't met a single Renter or person in the community who doesn't share that opinion as well.,40,,
304,0.97,50922.671,50926.909,So please help our communities and to our apartment complex and pass the 180 days notice in rental assistance.,40,,

310,0.97,50952.601,50970.452,And our first agenda item is a community panel of Renters and Renters' rights advocates who will give their viewpoint and also share data on why they believe some of these bills are extremely important.,41,,
311,0.97,50970.452,50976.258,I will read out the names.,41,,
312,0.97,50976.258,50985.134,And I know many of you already know your relational affiliation for the record and go with your point.,41,,

318,0.97,50999.782,51011.226,I'm just here in support of the proposed bill that Council member Sawant's office is introducing.,42,,
319,0.97,51011.226,51013.996,"At Hjp, we strongly support tenant protections.",42,,
320,0.97,51013.996,51016.065,Moving is really Unaffordable for most folks.,42,,
321,0.97,51016.065,51022.938,And especially if you're asking them to move in such a short notice.,42,,
322,0.97,51022.938,51028.31,"And if they can't afford the place, families are Riving thousands of dollars on having to save up.",42,,
323,0.97,51028.31,51034.316,And the majority of Americans don't even have an extra few hundred in the bank lying around.,42,,
324,0.97,51034.316,51083.365,I think it's just really an impossible ask for folk folks.,42,,
325,0.97,51083.365,51086.368,I think we all know without laws to back them up.,42,,
326,0.97,51086.368,51088.37,You can throw all the attorneys in the world at the problem.,42,,
327,0.97,51088.37,51096.578,"But t the end of the day, they can only do what's allowed under state law.",42,,
328,0.97,51096.578,51098.347,Absolutely.,43,,
329,0.97,51098.347,51099.515,Very well noted.,43,,

332,0.97,51106.622,51113.195,"Just to share with the public, the housing has reported this.",43,,
333,0.97,51113.195,51116.198,That Evictions are becoming housing Evictions that affect our communities.,43,,
334,0.97,51116.198,51126.742,And we know that communities of color are so disproportionately affected by Eviction.,43,,
335,0.97,51126.742,51129.278,People now are already saddled Covid-Related debts.,43,,
336,0.97,51129.278,51135.851,And all of this is just coming down the pipeline for them.,43,,
337,0.97,51135.851,51143.091,"I wanted to ask Council members, would you have any questions for jam and comments you would like to make?",43,,
338,0.97,51150.165,51153.635,I'm scanning the room to see if there are any requests.,43,,
339,0.97,51153.635,51156.004,"I don't see any at the moment, Tram.",43,,
340,0.97,51156.004,51157.105,Please stay if you're able to.,43,,
341,0.97,51157.105,51160.075,"But if you need to leave, we totally understand.",43,,
342,0.97,51160.075,51164.346,Really appreciate it.,43,,
343,0.97,51164.346,51172.921,"And we will be in contact with your office, the housing district project, as always.",43,,
344,0.97,51172.921,51174.556,"Let's welcome Violet who--Oh, sorry.",43,,
345,0.97,51174.556,51180.129,I have a note here that she can only comment.,43,,
346,0.97,51180.129,51181.43,We'll wait for that.,43,,
347,0.97,51181.43,51193.642,We do have Gina Owens who is a member of the Seattle Renters' Commission and has been a longtime activist with the Washington community action network.,43,,
348,0.97,51193.642,51196.345,Can you please introduce yourself Sdproerd then go ahead?,43,,
349,0.97,51196.345,51200.849,Thank you.,44,,
350,0.97,51200.849,51206.288,I appreciate your ask meeting to be here today.,44,,
351,0.97,51206.288,51211.093,I also appreciate all of the other Council members who are here today because these issues are important.,44,,
352,0.97,51211.093,51215.397,I do want to talk a little bit about the two bills.,44,,
353,0.97,51215.397,51230.779,"But before I do, I wanted to just give a short brief about why these bills are personally important for me.",44,,
354,0.97,51230.779,51232.18,"In the 2000, I was in a car accident.",44,,
355,0.97,51232.18,51247.829,I think a lot of people know that story.,44,,
356,0.97,51253.035,51258.373,"I am no longer strong enough, stable enough to work.",44,,
357,0.97,51258.373,51263.111,And that took away my income.,44,,
358,0.97,51263.111,51268.016,"In 20001, I was Eviblthed.",44,,
359,0.97,51268.016,51271.954,I was evicted.,44,,
360,0.97,51271.954,51276.625,"I went through the whole homeless in Seattle thing there, homeless shelters and transitional housing.",44,,
361,0.97,51276.625,51289.071,Dealing with the case managers and the social workers.,44,,
362,0.97,51289.071,51291.773,It was really demoralizing for me and a lot of people.,44,,
363,0.97,51291.773,51296.411,That has been the reason I do the advocacy work I do in the community.,44,,
364,0.97,51296.411,51306.321,"That being said, these two issues are personal for me.",44,,
365,0.97,51306.321,51312.194,"One because I lost my income, so I want able to pay my rent which led to the Eviction.",44,,
366,0.97,51312.194,51326.241,"So the six-month notice for rent important for Me., is very because Seattle Renters right now are in an extreme crisis.",44,,
367,0.97,51326.241,51327.676,Partly due to skyrocketing rents.,44,,
368,0.97,51327.676,51334.65,"And partly due to the enormous call for landlords for Evictions, which are happening across the state.",44,,
369,0.97,51334.65,51346.361,But we're focusing on Seattle for this meeting today.,44,,
370,0.97,51346.361,51349.264,I want to talk about B that.,44,,
371,0.97,51349.264,51351.233,Seattle people need six months.,44,,
372,0.97,51351.233,51359.307,"I think it's important so that they have the time, especially arch the pandemic.",44,,
373,0.97,51359.307,51361.076,We're just now coming out of it.,44,,
374,0.97,51361.076,51376.892,They need the time to look for new housing.,44,,
375,0.97,51395.377,51400.549,60 days would have been enough before the city of Seattle Hoising emergency.,44,,
376,0.97,51400.549,51405.654,"Since that declaration, the city of Seattle has increased housing cost, food costs and more.",44,,
377,0.97,51405.654,51410.325,But our wages for workers have been stagnating.,44,,
378,0.97,51410.325,51419.801,I've been working with individuals and their families during my advocacy.,44,,
379,0.97,51419.801,51428.043,They are suppressed to the point stressed to the point of mental depression because of what I call the three hard core issue We'Res now living.,44,,
380,0.97,51428.043,51431.313,"Pandemic, the economic warfare.",44,,
381,0.97,51431.313,51438.019,"And I say warfare because, frankly, the working class versus the wealthy class.",44,,
382,0.97,51438.019,51442.09,"And the third but most important, job loss.",44,,
383,0.97,51442.09,51455.67,So many thousands of people are still in this situation where they have lost their job.,44,,
384,0.97,51455.67,51465.347,"Either because businesses have gone down or because they're not ever going to reopen, but there's still thousands of people out of work.",44,,
385,0.97,51465.347,51477.159,180 days notice before rent increases remain more time for Renters to look for a new place and building enough money for that kind of move.,44,,
386,0.97,51477.159,51489.304,Without the stressors of mental issues and living through all of these things.,44,,
387,0.97,51547.195,51551.933,Will help to slow this process down.,45,,
388,0.97,51551.933,51556.738,And ensure fair practices for all people concerned.,45,,
389,0.97,51556.738,51558.773,Tenants as well as landlords.,45,,
390,0.97,51558.773,51559.574,And that concludes my notes.,45,,
391,0.97,51559.574,51562.544,Thank you for listening to me.,45,,
392,0.97,51567.616,51571.62,"Thank you so much, Gina.",46,,
393,0.97,51571.62,51572.487,I really appreciate your comments.,46,,
394,0.97,51572.487,51579.361,"And I would say to all of our speakers, you're welcome to stay in case they have questions or comments for you.",46,,
395,0.97,51579.361,51580.161,I also wanted to note.,46,,
396,0.97,51580.161,51582.664,I'm sorry if you mentioned it and I missed it.,46,,
397,0.97,51582.664,51613.528,But I just wanted to note that Gena and others from the Washington community action network played just a really incredibly crucial role in 2015 when we won the Renters' legislation to require landlords to limit moving fees.,46,,
398,0.97,51615.363,51616.298,Very important role.,46,,
399,0.97,51616.298,51617.899,"Gina personally, you were there.",46,,
400,0.97,51617.899,51619.935,I really appreciate that.,46,,
401,0.97,51619.935,51631.279,Our next Speaker that I wanted to invite is Sharon Crowley who is a member of the Seattle Renter Commission also.,46,,
402,0.97,51631.279,51634.683,And a member of the UAW 4121.,46,,
403,0.97,51634.683,51635.183,Hi there.,47,,
404,0.97,51635.183,51643.291,I want to thank you for having me here.,47,,
405,0.97,51643.291,51653.735,And I want to thank you for being a stalwart champion for working people and Renters in Seattle.,47,,
406,0.97,51653.735,51659.474,It's inspiring and it's a pleasure.,47,,
407,0.97,51659.474,51666.815,I'm an Organizer and member of Uawa local 4121.,47,,
408,0.97,51666.815,51676.124,I'm also a member of the Seattle Renters' Commission and member of district 6. in the past I rented in district three and District five.,47,,
409,0.97,51676.124,51678.293,"And also district four, actually.",47,,
410,0.97,51678.293,51685.467,"So my Union represents over 6,000 academic workers at the University of Washington.",47,,
411,0.97,51685.467,51691.573,"Tutors, graders, instructors and researchers who are also undergraduate and graduate students at the same time.",47,,
412,0.97,51691.573,51692.04,And also Postdocs.,47,,
413,0.97,51692.04,51697.479,Our members have been hit hard by the housing crisis which started long before Covid-19.,47,,
414,0.97,51697.479,51699.881,Over half of our members are rent burdened.,47,,
415,0.97,51699.881,51703.118,And over a third pay more than half of their income in rent.,47,,
416,0.97,51703.118,51707.288,"So we know this trend isn't just limited to our members too, of course.",47,,
417,0.97,51707.288,51709.891,And it's affecting all Renters and workers in Seattle.,47,,
418,0.97,51709.891,51713.061,It has been all along.,47,,
419,0.97,51713.061,51723.238,And it's having disproportionate impacts on black and Brown people in communities in our city.,47,,
420,0.97,51723.238,51723.705,And everywhere.,47,,
421,0.97,51723.705,51731.746,"So long before Covid, we'd seen these problems Uplifting families in Seattle, it's led to economic displacement.",47,,
422,0.97,51731.746,51736.584,"The destruction of longstanding communities like the central district, which is the example that lots of people are citing.",47,,
423,0.97,51736.584,51748.029,And it's also starting to spread further out from the core of Seattle.,47,,
424,0.97,51748.029,51755.07,"They level the existing structures and replace them with sleek, expensive housing that Railriders of that community cannot afford.",47,,
425,0.97,51755.07,51755.937,We all know this story.,47,,
426,0.97,51755.937,51759.607,And everybody just sort of throws their hands up and doesn't know what to do about it.,47,,
427,0.97,51759.607,51764.446,But we have to do something about it.,47,,
428,0.97,51764.446,51772.12,"Covid led us to sort of push a pause button on rent increases and Evictions, which was a big help to a lot of people.",47,,
429,0.97,51772.12,51773.488,But we knew it was temporary.,47,,
430,0.97,51773.488,51782.564,"Now as the restrictions are beginning to ease, we see that rent in Seattle has gone up by almost 19% just since January.",47,,
431,0.97,51782.564,51785.6,This is way faster than the pace of inflation.,47,,
432,0.97,51785.6,51792.073,And way faster than anywhere else in the country.,47,,
433,0.97,51792.073,51797.479,But workers and Renters have barely had a chance to regain working wages so they can rebuild their lives.,47,,
434,0.97,51797.479,51802.784,Meanwhile we're struggling with all of the health and mental health impacts of the pandemic.,47,,
435,0.97,51802.784,51816.464,And how it's impacted our jobs and our lives and our families.,47,,
436,0.97,51816.464,51824.806,"Taken together, these two trends are squeezing Renters and workers from both directions.",47,,
437,0.97,51824.806,51825.874,Rents are rising.,47,,
438,0.97,51825.874,51829.944,This is true for all Renters and working people in Seattle.,47,,
439,0.97,51829.944,51835.884,"The average in Seattle is almost $2,400 for a One-Bedroom apartment.",47,,
440,0.97,51835.884,51838.219,I personally could not afford that.,47,,
441,0.97,51838.219,51840.889,"And it's almost $3,700 for a two-bedroom apartment.",47,,
442,0.97,51840.889,51844.692,"The average Seattle Renter would have to earn over $84,000 per year.",47,,
443,0.97,51844.692,51862.944,"Just in order to be right at the edge of being Rent-Burdened, which is paying more than a third of their wages in rent.",47,,
444,0.97,51862.944,51875.924,"Most of our members make well below $84,000 per year.",47,,
445,0.97,51875.924,51884.199,In might be surprising because these are folks who are Postdocs at the University of Washington.,47,,
446,0.97,51884.199,51894.542,They're doing world class research and being paid as little as the University can get away with paying them.,47,,
447,0.97,51894.542,51898.546,"Seattle homelessness crisis also Precovid, of course.",47,,
448,0.97,51898.546,51900.415,The pandemic has made things worse.,47,,
449,0.97,51900.415,51904.485,There's also that threat of Evictions from Covid debt.,47,,
450,0.97,51904.485,51914.062,"And for most people, even before Covid, 60 days is not enough time to pull together the amount of money and the resources that it takes to move.",47,,
451,0.97,51914.062,51916.664,There's a cost just associated with moving your stuff from place to place.,47,,
452,0.97,51916.664,51933.514,And also the moving cost that you face.,47,,
453,0.97,51962.61,51965.613,"All of us, we need both of these pieces of legislation.",47,,
454,0.97,51965.613,51974.222,It's a moral imperative to ensure that we do everything we can.,47,,
455,0.97,51974.222,51979.927,That alleviate the Covid-Related burdens that have fallen hardest on us.,47,,
456,0.97,51979.927,51987.902,Increasing the amount of notice that a landlord would have to give from 60 to 180 days would be a huge help for all Renters.,47,,
457,0.97,51987.902,51989.971,I know for a fact it would help our members.,47,,
458,0.97,51989.971,51995.343,I've been there chased from neighborhood to neighborhood in Seattle by increases.,47,,
459,0.97,51995.343,51998.947,And this was before Covid.,47,,
460,0.97,51998.947,52009.223,It's worse now.,47,,
461,0.97,52011.993,52015.063,It would be a huge help for people facing that situation.,47,,
462,0.97,52015.063,52031.446,It's a crucial piece of addressing our housing crisis in Seattle.,47,,
463,0.97,52031.913,52034.682,This assistance could prevent thousands of people from becoming homeless.,47,,
464,0.97,52034.682,52038.853,"And nobody should have to live to that knife edge, in my opinion.",47,,
465,0.97,52038.853,52045.193,So again I want to thank Council member Sawant for proposing these two critical pieces of legislation.,47,,
466,0.97,52045.193,52049.597,I think we have to pass them.,47,,
467,0.97,52049.597,52061.442,"And as I said earlier, I urge all of the members of the Council to also vote in favor of this legislation.",47,,
468,0.97,52061.442,52064.345,Thank you.,47,,
469,0.97,52064.345,52074.856,"Thank you so much, Sharon.",48,,
470,0.97,52089.937,52097.845,"If you compare the salaries of the workers to the salaries of the executive, it tells quite eye for.",48,,
471,0.97,52097.845,52100.581,And I know your Union has put a spotlight on that.,48,,
472,0.97,52100.581,52114.495,Some of your comments reminded me of the rent control concert that we had recently in the central district.,48,,
473,0.97,52114.495,52118.499,"And a member of your Union, I was very struck by what he said.",48,,
474,0.97,52118.499,52123.204,He said when he was preparing his remarks for the conference.,48,,
475,0.97,52123.204,52127.742,It suddenly Dawned on him that he has had to move every year.,48,,
476,0.97,52127.742,52141.956,He has not had one year where he didn't have to move.,48,,
477,0.97,52141.956,52150.631,So I think these bills are needed for people as a whole but also Udub Renters.,48,,
478,0.97,52150.631,52151.933,Just one more question.,48,,
479,0.97,52151.933,52158.206,"As UAW members, what are you noticing in terms of the Covid--obviously we're not out of the pandemic.",48,,
480,0.97,52158.206,52169.083,But the problems that much of our population has been Vaccinated are you observing that students registering who are Maybe in their home city are moving back?,48,,
481,0.97,52169.083,52170.785,Are you showing sort of phenomenon?,48,,
482,0.97,52170.785,52175.223,And is that going to obviously make the question of rent even more prominent?,48,,
483,0.97,52175.223,52183.831,And the second question is where do you believe most of the UAW members live?,48,,
484,0.97,52183.831,52190.137,Are they forced to farther and farther away from the U district just because they have to find somewhere they can afford?,48,,
485,0.97,52192.073,52195.943,I may not fully remember the first question.,49,,
486,0.97,52195.943,52197.111,I'm sorry.,49,,
487,0.97,52197.111,52204.819,I'm a little distracted by all of this stuff.,49,,
488,0.97,52204.819,52211.792,"So you're asking--the first question, could you repeat the first question?",49,,
489,0.97,52211.792,52221.302,"Yeah, just to ask, your Union has noticed any pattern where Maybe some of the student workers were still living at home during the pandemic, and now are moving back?",50,,
490,0.97,52221.302,52226.407,Is that going to be more of a life question for them?,50,,
491,0.97,52226.407,52228.342,"Yes, absolutely.",51,,
492,0.97,52228.342,52235.75,"And even among those who stayed in Seattle, they may have had partners that helped them to stay here.",51,,
493,0.97,52235.75,52240.655,But a lot of folks' partners also experienced the loss of wages because of Covid.,51,,
494,0.97,52240.655,52243.791,So even those who stayed here were struggling.,51,,
495,0.97,52243.791,52247.261,"But Yeah, a lot of folks did move back home.",51,,
496,0.97,52247.261,52251.265,Remember that about 40% of our members are international scholars.,51,,
497,0.97,52251.265,52252.567,So home for them meant overseas.,51,,
498,0.97,52252.567,52259.807,And many of them have not been able to return.,51,,
499,0.97,52259.807,52272.553,"But Udub is trying to impose restrictions on people working remotely, which is going to make it very difficult for existing and new Grad students and Postdocs who are international folks to navigate this.",51,,
500,0.97,52272.553,52280.494,Because many of them are in places where there are still travel restrictions.,51,,
501,0.97,52280.494,52281.562,So Udub is squeezing them still.,51,,
502,0.97,52281.562,52295.209,"And in answer to your question of where most of our Renters live, I think the majority still live in the U district but in much tighter quarters than previously.",51,,
503,0.97,52295.209,52302.85,They're living in situations where there's lots of roommates crammed into a smaller place than is ideal.,51,,
504,0.97,52302.85,52306.454,"But yes, a lot of folks have had to move further out.",51,,
505,0.97,52306.454,52312.059,I myself did when I was still a graduate Stude ended up living in Lake city.,51,,
506,0.97,52312.059,52319.3,And was right at the edge of the border with shoreline and was looking at moving even further away.,51,,
507,0.97,52319.3,52331.178,"But I think a lot of our members do still live closer in but in very Cramped, much more Cramped circumstances than is ideal for somebody who's a graduate student.",51,,
508,0.97,52331.178,52333.614,But really I think it's not ideal for anybody.,51,,
509,0.97,52333.614,52336.384,So I think both of those things are happening.,51,,
510,0.97,52336.384,52342.823,People moving further out and just Cramming more people into a smaller space.,51,,
511,0.97,52342.823,52344.258,Thank you so much.,52,,
512,0.97,52344.258,52351.065,That offers a glimpse into what it's like for a lot of the registrants.,52,,
513,0.97,52351.065,52353.334,"I really appreciate that, Sharon.",52,,
514,0.97,52353.334,52359.674,We have a Seattle Renter and a Starbucks Barista.,52,,
515,0.97,52359.674,52369.817,Welcome.,52,,
516,0.97,52382.63,52397.078,"Urging city council members, Renters, stand with the working class, Lgbtq and Trans community.",53,,
517,0.97,52443.357,52445.226,"Sorry, you keep freezing off and on.",54,,
518,0.97,52445.226,52447.828,So we're missing a lot of what you're saying.,54,,
519,0.97,52447.828,52448.496,"Oh, okay.",55,,
520,0.97,52448.496,52448.996,No problem.,56,,
521,0.97,52448.996,52450.398,Just keep going.,56,,
522,0.97,52450.398,52453.667,Can you hear me now?,57,,
523,0.97,52453.667,52454.068,Yes.,58,,
524,0.97,52454.068,52455.169,Okay.,59,,
525,0.97,52455.169,52461.809,Seattle rent as other people have said have rose 18.7% just from January to June.,59,,
526,0.97,52461.809,52470.451,"Those rent HIKES will cost the typical Seattle Renter an extra $3,300 a year.",59,,
527,0.97,52470.451,52472.186,I certainly can't afford that.,59,,
528,0.97,52472.186,52475.356,"If the landlords raise rent here 10% or more, I definitely couldn't afford it.",59,,
529,0.97,52475.356,52477.458,And I would have to move.,59,,
530,0.97,52477.458,52480.461,I would not be able to afford moving costs if this were to happen.,59,,
531,0.97,52480.461,52484.331,"And if I had six months to plan, that would be a huge help.",59,,
532,0.97,52484.331,52487.668,I urge you to vote yes on the relocation bill being put further today.,59,,
533,0.97,52487.668,52493.941,"I can't afford to move, and if my rents were to increase by 10% or more, I would have to.",59,,
534,0.97,52493.941,52504.451,But without assistance --,59,,
535,0.97,52516.43,52516.997,Decreasing homelessness.,60,,
536,0.97,52516.997,52524.071,"I'm worried about living on the street, and as a Trans person, that being be very dangerous.",60,,
537,0.97,52524.071,52529.81,Trans people are three times more likely to live in poverty and face three times more challenge when they're homeless.,60,,
538,0.97,52529.81,52536.116,Everyone agrees that rent is very high and it's very hard to live here with corporate landlords increasing the rent so often.,60,,
539,0.97,52554.134,52565.946,"Also saying that I fully support the movement that Council member Sawant, and the Renters' rights movement.",61,,
540,0.97,52566.247,52575.923,And beyond June 30th.,62,,
541,0.97,52577.358,52586.867,And closing loopholes to Seattle law that allow Landloerpd Renters at the end of six weeks.,62,,
542,0.97,52586.867,52596.377,"I urge Council members to add the six-month protection for any rent increase, and relocation for Renters facing a significant rent increase.",62,,
543,0.97,52596.377,52600.948,We also need to pass rent control to prevent rents from rising more than the cost of living.,62,,
544,0.97,52600.948,52610.09,"Without this, Renters will continue to be driven up by rent increases that far outpace the rent increases in wages.",62,,
545,0.97,52610.09,52621.602,"Thank you so much for allowing me the opportunity to share my experience as a community member, Barista and member.",62,,

548,0.97,52622.603,52631.946,"As we said speaking as a member of the Lgbt community, and also as a Barista, we Unfortunately missed a lot of your comments because of technical difficulties.",63,,
549,0.97,52631.946,52641.355,I would appreciate it if you could E-mail your full comments to my office and we will add it as the written record of this committee meeting.,63,,

556,0.97,52662.676,52663.444,Introduce yourself for the record.,63,,
557,0.97,52663.444,52667.881,Welcome.,63,,
558,0.97,52667.881,52669.45,"You're on mute, Jacob.",63,,
559,0.97,52669.45,52670.317,Sorry about that.,64,,
560,0.97,52670.317,52670.851,Thank you.,64,,
561,0.97,52670.851,52674.455,"Thank you, council member Sawant for having me.",64,,
562,0.97,52674.455,52689.169,And for putting forward these two really crucial pieces of legislation.,64,,
563,0.97,52689.169,52696.143,I just want to talk a little bit about how the piece of legislation would impact the members who sell our Newspaer.,64,,
564,0.97,52696.143,52702.316,For the low-income and housing vendors who make a living selling our newspaper.,64,,
565,0.97,52702.316,52708.589,Rent increases economic Eviction and displacement are each driver which is can lead back to living unsheltered on our streets.,64,,
566,0.97,52708.589,52717.064,And I want to thank Council member Sawant for eliminating with this legislation all that goes into being forced to find a new place to live.,64,,
567,0.97,52717.064,52719.967,Anxiety and uncertainty that a company is being displaced.,64,,
568,0.97,52719.967,52723.37,"Being forced to move is expensive, time-consuming and really stressful.",64,,
569,0.97,52723.37,52740.654,The expecting of someone being forced from their home can be expected to find a more affordable space in six days in Seattle is completely unrealistic.,64,,
570,0.97,52740.654,52759.139,"Specifically low-income and housing insecure folks like our vendors do not have the luxury to take time off from work to pursue housing needs, following up with landlords, plus work history, credit, and criminal background checks that Stigmatize the poor.",64,,
571,0.97,52759.139,52767.081,"And once housing has been secured, first deposits, fees are a major setback.",64,,
572,0.97,52767.081,52775.255,"Moving locally could be somewhere around $2,300, which is several months rent for a low-income person.",64,,
573,0.97,52775.255,52777.124,In se that is likely much higher.,64,,
574,0.97,52777.124,52784.198,And navigating the Seattle housing market as a poor person has many challenges.,64,,
575,0.97,52784.198,52804.752,And spending the time required to give rent increase notice to 180 days and requiring landlords to provide relocation assistance are really crucial Antidisplacement measures.,64,,
576,0.97,52804.752,52823.504,And these measures will help Incentivize owners to stabilize rent and keep Renters in their home homes.,64,,
577,0.97,52830.31,52832.279,So far we have a statement.,64,,
578,0.97,52832.279,52832.913,Happy to field questions.,64,,
579,0.97,52832.913,52834.882,And thank you so much for the opportunity to speak.,64,,

582,0.97,52840.587,52854.401,You're absolutely making the crucial link which we know is presented tremendously the difference between the struggles of Renters and then finally what happens when you become homeless.,65,,

635,0.97,53153.934,53163.51,Which is another extremely important component.,71,,
636,0.97,53163.51,53171.051,Go ahead with your presentation.,71,,
637,0.97,53171.051,53179.359,If you can share this screen of the presentation.,72,,
638,0.97,53179.359,53184.231,And I have limited bandwidth on my Internet connection right now so apologies if I cause any problems there.,72,,
639,0.97,53184.231,53192.272,So this is just a quick overview of the main policy.,72,,
640,0.97,53192.272,53197.41,Objectives and aspects of the economic displacement relocation assistance bill.,72,,
641,0.97,53197.41,53198.044,Regarding economic protections.,72,,
642,0.97,53198.044,53207.354,"Next slide, please.",72,,
643,0.97,53207.354,53215.195,"So the law right now in Seattle, there is relocation assistance in situations.",72,,
644,0.97,53215.195,53221.968,There's the tenant relocation assistance ordinance that's currently on the books.,72,,
645,0.97,53221.968,53238.018,"Under the tenant relocation assistance ordinance, people have--Renters have the right to get relocation assistance if their landlord Evicts them in order to Demolish the unit or Remodel the unit.",72,,
646,0.97,53238.018,53242.722,"In every other case where a Renter is forced to move, there's no relocation assistance.",72,,
647,0.97,53242.722,53260.307,"And of course from the point of view of the Renter, their cost is the thing regardless of whether their landlord intends to Demolish and they have to leave.",72,,
648,0.97,53260.307,53266.246,If the landlord RAISES the rent and the Renter is forced to move because the Landrecord RAISES the rent.,72,,
649,0.97,53266.246,53270.417,"In Seattle right now, there's currently no relocation assistance.",72,,
650,0.97,53270.417,53277.09,"And that's what this bill, this proposed bill would address.",72,,
651,0.97,53277.09,53279.593,"Next slide, please.",72,,
652,0.97,53279.593,53287.033,"So what this bill does, the eligibility criteria for getting relocation assistance is basically two months that need to happen.",72,,
653,0.97,53287.033,53292.939,First the landlord needs to raise the rent by 10% or more in a single year.,72,,
654,0.97,53292.939,53296.843,"That doesn't mean that they can raise it, you know, 9% each month.",72,,
655,0.97,53296.843,53303.75,It's over the course of that year.,72,,
656,0.97,53303.75,53304.651,10% or more.,72,,
657,0.97,53304.651,53305.318,Increasing rent.,72,,
658,0.97,53305.318,53318.298,And there's other bills in Seattle that have in the past used 10% at that threshold for what the Council deems an extremely large rental increase for the year.,72,,
659,0.97,53318.298,53324.504,The other thing that needs to happen is that needs to be sufficient for the Renter to have to move.,72,,
660,0.97,53324.504,53334.614,"So if the landlord, discussing with landlords in the past, people have raised situations where they have--where they say I talked to my tenants.",72,,
661,0.97,53334.614,53339.286,I needed to raise the rent by 1515%.,72,,
662,0.97,53339.286,53339.452,15%.,72,,
663,0.97,53339.452,53344.19,"I made sure it was something that my tenants could afford, so they didn't move.",72,,
664,0.97,53344.19,53345.025,No problem.,72,,
665,0.97,53345.025,53345.825,They didn't move.,72,,
666,0.97,53345.825,53347.961,That second condition was not met.,72,,
667,0.97,53347.961,53355.568,So there's no relocation assistance because nobody was displaced.,72,,
668,0.97,53355.568,53362.909,Or if a Renter moves because they ot a new job in another place and they just moved to that other location.,72,,
669,0.97,53362.909,53365.345,And it's not because the rents had been raised.,72,,
670,0.97,53365.345,53370.25,The rents were only raised the rate of inflation.,72,,
671,0.97,53370.25,53370.984,"2%, 3%.",72,,
672,0.97,53370.984,53373.42,There's no relocation assistance required.,72,,
673,0.97,53373.42,53376.823,That's something that the Renter tries to do in their own life.,72,,
674,0.97,53376.823,53384.364,It wasn't forced by the landlord raising the rent.,72,,
675,0.97,53384.364,53403.45,"But if the if they have to relocate, that's when the Renter is eligible for relocation assistance.",72,,
676,0.97,53416.763,53424.204,These points were made.,72,,
677,0.97,53424.204,53429.008,Many people have to take time off work to go seek another apartment.,72,,
678,0.97,53429.008,53445.692,There are many costs that are involved in having to move.,72,,
679,0.97,53456.97,53469.182,Relocation assistance ordinances where there's remodeling or the landlord needs to Remode the building.,72,,
680,0.97,53469.182,53478.124,And the city pays half of the costs of the Clooilz.,72,,
681,0.97,53478.124,53488.234,"Relocation assistance . In this legislation, the landlord has raised the rent by 10% or more and not even spending money on remodeling.",72,,
682,0.97,53488.234,53492.438,So there's a certain assumes going forward.,72,,
683,0.97,53492.438,53493.039,Assumption going forward.,72,,
684,0.97,53493.039,53509.122,The landlord has made this decision and has the money coming in to pay for it.,72,,
685,0.97,53509.122,53519.132,And the 2019 one for the first time asks people the reasons why they move.,72,,
686,0.97,53519.132,53520.567,And that's provided some color about those reasons.,72,,
687,0.97,53520.567,53528.374,The color bar on the right side of the scene.,72,,
688,0.97,53528.374,53541.821,The red is those red reasons.,72,,
689,0.97,53551.664,53560.773,The 35% in those red blocks are people who say displacement was the reason they moved.,72,,
690,0.97,53560.773,53568.348,This bill is not specific to 10% rent increases or--it's more gentle than that.,72,,
691,0.97,53568.348,53569.282,And it's not just Seattle.,72,,
692,0.97,53569.282,53571.684,You can look at where Seattle is on the map.,72,,
693,0.97,53571.684,53580.493,And there's a whole lot of rent there.,72,,
694,0.97,53580.493,53586.533,So this is just an idea of how significant a piece of legislation this is.,72,,
695,0.97,53586.533,53594.24,This is going to affect many people.,72,,
696,0.97,53594.24,53596.976,Many people are economically displaced.,72,,
697,0.97,53596.976,53600.079,We got this information from the city.,72,,
698,0.97,53600.079,53605.718,They are currently working on isolating the Seattle data and will come out with Seattle data soon.,72,,
699,0.97,53605.718,53614.26,And we'll be able to look at to give more precise numbers about the impact of this legislation.,72,,
700,0.97,53614.26,53616.696,"Fwlks slide, please.",72,,
701,0.97,53616.696,53621.267,"Next slide, please.",72,,
702,0.97,53621.267,53622.569,There we go.,72,,
703,0.97,53622.569,53628.541,So there are many things that this legislation does.,72,,
704,0.97,53628.541,53633.112,This slide identifies a couple areas of further work.,72,,
705,0.97,53633.112,53642.221,"Either as an amendment within this bill or in some cases, it may have to be subsequent bills.",72,,
706,0.97,53642.221,53648.261,First there is the question of creating a fee to fund the administration of this program.,72,,
707,0.97,53648.261,53652.465,A fee that Landloefrds would pay when they economically Evict people.,72,,
708,0.97,53652.465,53662.642,"The way the legislation is designed, there's no direct payments between the landlord and the Renter for relocation assistance because there's too much an unfair power dynamic there.",72,,
709,0.97,53662.642,53665.311,So instead all the money goes through the city.,72,,
710,0.97,53665.311,53681.894,"The landlords pay the city, then the city pays the tenant.",72,,
711,0.97,53686.399,53690.503,Will but that Arowsllows the powerful city to make sure the money actually gets paid.,72,,
712,0.97,53690.503,53700.413,And that's the same way the relocation assistance ordinance works.,72,,
713,0.97,53700.413,53704.017,That does mean the city of Seattle has a significant role in this administration.,72,,
714,0.97,53704.017,53718.097,And that is something that could be paid by Lan Lord Lords.,72,,
715,0.97,53718.097,53718.431,Landlords.,72,,
716,0.97,53718.431,53722.001,"Although with that one, the city actually pays half of it.",72,,
717,0.97,53722.001,53725.872,So it's not exactly an apples and oranges comparison.,72,,
718,0.97,53725.872,53732.745,Or it is an apples and oranges comparison.,72,,
719,0.97,53732.745,53738.251,It's some kind of fruit fruits.,72,,
720,0.97,53738.251,53751.798,This is focused on economic Evictions when Renters are forced to move by rent increase increases.,72,,
721,0.97,53751.798,53761.974,They were focused on one type of No-Fault Eviction when a landlord Evicts somebody to Remodel or Demolish the building.,72,,
722,0.97,53761.974,53770.149,It's something that a landlord does have that right to do that Eviction under the ordinance.,72,,
723,0.97,53770.149,53772.351,So relocation assistance is required.,72,,
724,0.97,53772.351,53780.827,But there's other types of No-Fault Evictions that are not covered by trail and are also not economic sanctions.,72,,
725,0.97,53780.827,53787.133,Such as if a landlord Evicts somebody in order to sell the property.,72,,
726,0.97,53787.133,53796.342,That is another area of work that needs to be addressed.,72,,
727,0.97,53796.342,53799.545,Thank you.,73,,
728,0.97,53799.545,53801.747,We really appreciate it.,73,,
729,0.97,53801.747,53802.448,Appreciate that overview.,73,,
730,0.97,53802.448,53820.266,"Council members, if you have questions or comments on this presentation . is there something you wanted to add?",73,,
731,0.97,53831.677,53832.545,Sure.,74,,
732,0.97,53832.545,53836.949,I'll make a couple additional comments.,74,,
733,0.97,53836.949,53843.79,There are a few changes that are reflected in the new draft.,74,,
734,0.97,53843.79,53844.09,The agenda.,74,,
735,0.97,53844.09,53846.092,That were not included in the previous draft.,74,,
736,0.97,53846.092,53856.202,"And the major one is the addition of the ability of s, it Pi to pursue Stpi to pursue citations rather than just notices of the violation.",74,,
737,0.97,53856.202,53869.348,"In our discussions with SBCI about how to implement the administration of the new program, they expressed a desire to have flexibility to do one or the other.",74,,
738,0.97,53869.348,53870.483,Depending on the violation itself.,74,,
739,0.97,53870.483,53874.787,And I'll share this for everybody.,75,,
740,0.97,53874.787,53882.428,Can you explain the difference between what's a citation and what is a notice of violation?,75,,
741,0.97,53882.428,53883.796,Sure.,76,,
742,0.97,53883.796,53889.969,So citations are primarily the SBCI finds that there has been a violation of the law.,76,,
743,0.97,53889.969,53893.906,"And just sends a citation that basically Salz here's what the violation is, here's how much you pay.",76,,
744,0.97,53893.906,53899.278,And you have to pay in order to comply.,76,,
745,0.97,53899.278,53903.182,It's almost like a ticket that's sent to the landlord.,76,,
746,0.97,53903.182,53913.392,A notice of violation can be a little bit more involved just because it may involve a little bit more of an investigation.,76,,
747,0.97,53913.392,53921.367,And then the penalties are more discretionary than they are for the citation.,76,,
748,0.97,53921.367,53925.338,The citation itself is included in this legislation.,76,,
749,0.97,53925.338,53929.809,"$1,000 for the first penalty, and $2,000 for a subsequent penalty.",76,,
750,0.97,53929.809,53934.38,And the notice of violation can be a little more flexible about what that is.,76,,
751,0.97,53934.38,53948.361,"At the point at which this legislation gets increased and discussed in Committee, the Memose I'll prepare will layout al of the reasons we do citations versus Noti violations.",76,,
752,0.97,53948.361,53965.044,And what the differences are between those I'll prepare will layout all of the reasons we do citations versus notice of violations.,76,,
753,0.97,53965.044,53966.178,And what the differences are between those things.,76,,
754,0.97,53966.178,53990.67,We do have some more information from the Examiner about what the second resources are going to take to implement this legislation.,76,,
755,0.97,53995.174,54014.06,"So it can do all the work of accepting the complaints, figuring out when the payments come in.",76,,
756,0.97,54014.06,54033.612,Determining whether Somebod is qualified for location assistance and making those determinations.,76,,
757,0.97,54033.612,54042.254,"The hearing Examiner goes, there are the cases that would go to the hearing Examiner are appeals of the determination from SBCI.",76,,
758,0.97,54042.254,54053.366,"And with this new addition of the citations, any bills from that citation process goes to the hearing examiner as well.",76,,
759,0.97,54053.366,54057.069,So both SBCI and the hearing Examiner have the current versions of these bills.,76,,
760,0.97,54057.069,54062.742,"So if there are updates to the case load issues or workload issues, they will be sharing those.",76,,
761,0.97,54062.742,54063.943,And we will update them at that point.,76,,
762,0.97,54074.086,54075.321,Thank you so much.,77,,
763,0.97,54075.321,54078.791,Is it possible--I totally finished it's not.,77,,
764,0.97,54078.791,54103.082,"But at the next Meetingy or Committee in preparation for the next committee meeting, it might be helpful to get sort of a flow chart of what it is tenants should do.",77,,
765,0.97,54105.684,54106.786,And also Council members to follow through at that point.,77,,
766,0.97,54108.187,54109.088,Absolutely.,78,,
767,0.97,54109.088,54115.061,I'd be happy to prepare a flow chart.,78,,
768,0.97,54115.061,54116.362,Fantastic.,79,,
769,0.97,54116.362,54128.34,"Council members, any questions or comments while we have Asha here and also--yes.",79,,
770,0.97,54128.34,54130.376,And obviously it's not last opportunity.,79,,
771,0.97,54130.376,54131.944,Please look over the wording of the bill.,79,,
772,0.97,54131.944,54136.982,Let me know if you have any queries or any Clarifications necessary.,79,,
773,0.97,54136.982,54145.091,Any time between now and July 27th.,79,,
774,0.97,54145.091,54155.501,Not seeing any comments.,79,,
775,0.97,54180.426,54186.532,Rent control policy in different parts of the nation and what economist says what works and what doesn't work.,79,,
776,0.97,54186.532,54190.269,That is available--that obviously was available at the agenda materials for the last meeting.,79,,
777,0.97,54190.269,54206.085,And it's also available on my Council office Website.,79,,
778,0.97,54212.558,54220.099,"Seeing no objections, we'll move t item number four.",79,,
779,0.97,54220.099,54229.675,"Which is the bill to increase the notice required for rent increases for six months from what we have today, which is two months notice.",79,,
780,0.97,54229.675,54237.85,"The legislation is, I believe, fairly straight forward.",79,,
781,0.97,54237.85,54239.184,But again any questions Council members might have at this point?,79,,
782,0.97,54246.926,54249.662,"Thank you, chair Sawant.",80,,
783,0.97,54249.662,54250.963,I did have a question.,80,,
784,0.97,54250.963,54253.566,Sorry I didn't raise my hand fast enough.,80,,
785,0.97,54253.566,54256.835,I did have a question about the previous bill.,80,,
786,0.97,54256.835,54259.972,And I'm glad Asha is the same central staff analyst.,80,,
787,0.97,54259.972,54264.076,May I ask a question about the previous proposal?,80,,
788,0.97,54264.076,54264.41,Absolutely.,81,,
789,0.97,54264.41,54264.643,Okay.,82,,
790,0.97,54264.643,54271.517,And thank you to your staff for their presentation.,82,,
791,0.97,54271.517,54275.854,The question I have is just trying to work through a hypothetical example.,82,,
792,0.97,54275.854,54290.703,"So if a landlord is charging $2,000 a month in rent and they want to raise it by 10%, let's say, and so that's $200.",82,,
793,0.97,54290.703,54305.184,"If the tenant can't afford that and leaves, then the city would pay that tenant $6,000.",82,,
794,0.97,54305.184,54322.568,"And so if the landlord is successful in Rerenting that unit to somebody else for $2,200, it would take a couple of years for them to recoup that $6,000.",82,,
795,0.97,54322.568,54328.874,So I just want to make sure that that's appropriate or that's an accurate hypothetical.,82,,
796,0.97,54328.874,54339.551,"Because I thought I heard in the presentation somebody say the landlord could afford to do something to pay the $6,000.",82,,
797,0.97,54339.551,54340.119,And I wasn't clear.,82,,
798,0.97,54340.119,54340.786,They necessarily can.,82,,
799,0.97,54340.786,54343.789,But I understand the logic of the three months.,82,,
800,0.97,54343.789,54351.03,"You're saying because when they move, they're gonNA have to pay first, last month's rent, security deposit, it's pretty common.",82,,
801,0.97,54351.03,54357.236,I just want to understand the math there.,82,,
802,0.97,54357.236,54359.605,Asha is nodding so I think I'm understanding it.,82,,
803,0.97,54359.605,54360.873,Appreciate that.,82,,
804,0.97,54360.873,54366.612,"The only clarification I'd add is that the tenant that moves out would get that $6,000.",83,,
805,0.97,54366.612,54371.183,"Assuming they were the only one that was paying $2,000.",83,,
806,0.97,54371.183,54377.556,"And so it's just based on how many, the whole amount of rent and how many households are within that unit.",83,,
807,0.97,54377.556,54380.592,So the way you explained it is correct for one household.,83,,
808,0.97,54380.592,54397.71,"If it turns out that it was two households that were paying a total of $2,000, and for example one of the tenants decided to move out, the other didn't, then the landlord would be paying $3,000 to that tenant.",83,,
809,0.97,54397.71,54402.047,"So the whole unit would be moving out, it would be $6,000.",83,,
810,0.97,54402.047,54404.583,"If just one were moving out, it would be $3,000.",83,,
811,0.97,54404.583,54407.453,So the calculation for the unit is gonNA be the same.,83,,
812,0.97,54407.453,54412.391,"How much the tenant gets depends on how many households the rent is being split between, if that makes sense.",83,,
813,0.97,54412.391,54413.358,Okay.,84,,
814,0.97,54413.358,54427.106,"So if it's a two-bedroom unit, and it's $2,000, and the landlord attempts to raise it $2,200, those tenants move out, they would each get $6,000.",84,,
815,0.97,54427.106,54428.507,"They would each get $3,000.",85,,
816,0.97,54428.507,54430.142,"Okay, thank you for clarifying that.",86,,
817,0.97,54430.142,54430.476,Appreciate it.,86,,
818,0.97,54430.476,54432.544,"That was the only question I had right now, chair Sawant.",86,,
819,0.97,54432.544,54435.447,Thank you.,86,,
820,0.97,54435.447,54436.348,Thank you.,87,,
821,0.97,54436.348,54437.282,Council member Pederson.,87,,
822,0.97,54437.282,54438.65,And also Asha for your response.,87,,
823,0.97,54438.65,54455.768,"And on that, just to follow up on that, I know we are looking at information from other states just to see what is being done in other cases like maybe Oregon or some parts of California.",87,,
824,0.97,54455.768,54462.241,I don't have the exact numbers.,88,,
825,0.97,54462.241,54463.609,But they are comparable.,88,,
826,0.97,54463.609,54470.949,"In Oregon, there's relocation assistance for economic Evictions like this.",88,,
827,0.97,54470.949,54473.352,And it is a relatively similar amount.,88,,
828,0.97,54473.352,54481.226,In both Oregon and--I'll have to go back and look at the exact numbers.,88,,
829,0.97,54481.226,54492.337,"In some cases it's a set amount, rather than being a portion relative to the amount of the previous rent.",88,,
830,0.97,54492.337,54500.512,"So for example, it would be $4,000 regardless of how much rent was being charged previously.",88,,
831,0.97,54500.512,54520.966,"When we were looking at the different policy questions in this legislation, we found that the reality is that the big difference between the relocation assistance that is needed for one person moving out of a studio and the relocation assistance of eight people moving out of an Eight-Person house.",88,,
832,0.97,54593.272,54597.075,Because really they were trying to create a form of rent control in that way.,88,,
833,0.97,54597.075,54598.877,To make it impossible to pay.,88,,
834,0.97,54598.877,54602.247,"And the corporate said, well, you can't do that.",88,,
835,0.97,54602.247,54604.116,That would be rent control.,88,,
836,0.97,54604.116,54621.3,"But what the amount that you were, that Cloois was pegged at, Cloois is relocation assistance is pegged at, that would be okay.",88,,
837,0.97,54625.103,54625.671,Thank you.,89,,
838,0.97,54625.671,54635.38,"It will be useful in addition to everything that Asha shared with us, it will be really useful to have that and we can get more precise numbers.",89,,
839,0.97,54635.38,54638.417,You can share it with all the committee members.,89,,
840,0.97,54638.417,54641.553,"Thank you for that question, council member Peterson.",89,,
841,0.97,54641.553,54647.426,Any questions on either of the two bills?,89,,
842,0.97,54647.426,54648.093,Don't see.,89,,
843,0.97,54648.093,54649.461,Madame chair?,90,,
844,0.97,54649.461,54650.128,Yes.,91,,
845,0.97,54650.128,54650.862,"Council member Juarez, go ahead.",91,,
846,0.97,54650.862,54651.63,Thank you.,92,,
847,0.97,54651.63,54654.366,I just have a quick question I was gonNA ask Offline.,92,,
848,0.97,54654.366,54655.2,But it's pretty straight forward.,92,,
849,0.97,54655.2,54662.507,I had a chance to look at the ordinance.,92,,
850,0.97,54662.507,54669.614,This is item number four.,92,,
851,0.97,54669.614,54674.252,So why six months or 180 days rather than--I understand 60 days.,92,,
852,0.97,54674.252,54679.691,Why six months?,92,,
853,0.97,54679.691,54680.959,What is the reasoning behind that?,92,,
854,0.97,54680.959,54684.83,Was there a reason for that number or time period?,92,,
855,0.97,54684.83,54687.733,"Ted, go ahead.",93,,
856,0.97,54687.733,54689.401,I see your hand is up.,93,,
857,0.97,54689.401,54692.571,So again there's a precedent.,94,,
858,0.97,54692.571,54697.576,In this case it's Montreal.,94,,
859,0.97,54697.576,54705.217,But the other--and the way that came to us is the Seattle Renter's Commission was looking at this issue.,94,,
860,0.97,54705.217,54707.252,And this is a couple years ago.,94,,
861,0.97,54707.252,54710.889,But they were looking at this issue.,94,,
862,0.97,54710.889,54715.727,And they looked at best practices around the country and around the world.,94,,
863,0.97,54715.727,54720.599,And they wrote a letter to the Council urging six months based on that.,94,,
864,0.97,54720.599,54723.935,And it was on their recommendation.,94,,
865,0.97,54723.935,54732.144,And we don't have another city to look to that that gives the landlord has to give six months notice that they intend to raise the rent?,95,,
866,0.97,54732.144,54735.28,"It's just the Montreal, city of Montreal?",95,,
867,0.97,54735.28,54736.281,Which is fine.,95,,
868,0.97,54736.281,54738.083,I'm just trying to --,95,,
869,0.97,54738.083,54743.221,Yes.,96,,
870,0.97,54743.221,54743.688,The city of Montreal.,96,,
871,0.97,54743.688,54753.098,"And Unfortunately, Seattle has been graded by other cities first and we follow them, but that's not true in the case of many Renters' rights.",96,,
872,0.97,54753.098,54758.47,"So in that sense, no, we don't those examples.",96,,
873,0.97,54758.47,54763.075,But my office didn't come up with this number.,96,,
874,0.97,54763.075,54775.32,We followed the recommendation of the Renters' Commission who recommended based on--the data they looked at and felt that was a fair time for Renters.,96,,
875,0.97,54775.32,54778.19,I'm not trying to do a Gotcha thing.,97,,
876,0.97,54778.19,54800.545,"What I'm trying to get at is with the way the rental market is and how difficult it is, and particularly with the pandemic, and particularly with people with families and what we've been Keeling with, I'm wondering if we can have some Offline discussions back in committee about maybe not six months but certainly more than 60.",97,,
877,0.97,54800.545,54802.314,I'm more inclined to see that.,97,,
878,0.97,54802.314,54804.683,And talk a little bit more to that.,97,,
879,0.97,54804.683,54810.088,And see if there's a way to escalate that up to six months.,97,,
880,0.97,54810.088,54813.258,That's just me trying to be practical.,97,,
881,0.97,54813.258,54815.927,About addressing an issue and getting it across the finish line.,97,,
882,0.97,54815.927,54820.098,"If that's something you want to entertain later, council member Sawant.",97,,
883,0.97,54820.098,54823.335,I'm just letting you know now what my thinking is.,97,,
884,0.97,54823.335,54827.305,I just wanted to share that to be straight forward and honest.,97,,
885,0.97,54827.305,54831.443,And being a little bit more practical about how we make things move forward.,97,,
886,0.97,54831.443,54834.88,But I appreciate what you've given us to look at.,97,,
887,0.97,54834.88,54839.084,And I appreciate the briefing from Ted and from Asha.,97,,
888,0.97,54839.084,54844.623,"Thank you, council member Juarez.",98,,
889,0.97,54844.623,54854.8,I appreciate you being Upfront about what your thinking is.,98,,
890,0.97,54854.8,54863.708,"Obviously I would--anything significantly more than what we have today, which is two months, would be a significant step forward.",98,,
891,0.97,54863.708,54873.251,Obviously you know I'm also straight forward so I will of course recommend what the Renter's Commission has recommended.,98,,
892,0.97,54873.251,54876.354,But at the same time I really welcome any discussion with your office on this.,98,,
893,0.97,54876.354,54879.124,So please make sure that your staff reaches out to my staff.,98,,
894,0.97,54879.124,54890.202,"Or I'm happy to--if you want to set up a meeting where we all meet alongside our staff, that would be great as well.",98,,
895,0.97,54890.202,54890.702,Thank you.,99,,
896,0.97,54890.702,54894.039,We have about ten days.,100,,
897,0.97,54894.039,54902.48,"I also appreciate that--and as just quickly regarding item number three, in principle, I agree with you about rent control.",101,,
898,0.97,54902.48,54905.25,I think we just have differences in what that means.,101,,
899,0.97,54905.25,54913.258,"And I think this has been an ongoing discussion that you and I have had many times Offline, both professionally, personally, intellectually.",101,,
900,0.97,54913.258,54915.694,And I am supportive of that.,101,,
901,0.97,54915.694,54918.663,I think we just have different ideas about how we would implement that.,101,,
902,0.97,54918.663,54925.87,I still welcome and appreciate that you're very candid with me and straight forward about how that can become a reality in this city.,101,,
903,0.97,54925.87,54926.771,Whatever Seattle rent control looks like.,101,,
904,0.97,54926.771,54928.34,So thank you.,101,,
905,0.97,54928.34,54929.674,Thank you.,102,,
906,0.97,54929.674,54932.844,I appreciate that.,102,,
907,0.97,54932.844,54944.823,"And when we meet, I'm happy to look at the relation more urgently on the six month thing and also on rent control.",102,,
908,0.97,54944.823,54947.626,We have a special committee Sdled in September to go forward with that.,102,,
909,0.97,54947.626,54951.63,And this is what we were saying about practical.,102,,
910,0.97,54951.63,54957.769,Obviously I welcome any discussions that we can have as committee members.,102,,
911,0.97,54957.769,54979.691,"I do feel obligated to point out that for Renters, this is a question, when we arrive at recommendations, based on housing advocacy and who studies issues, I do believe that they come up with these relations not out of wanting to have gratuitous approach Aga landlords.",102,,
912,0.97,54979.691,54981.393,It is really from a practical standpoint.,102,,
913,0.97,54981.393,54989.567,"What is it that Renters need today, given the onslaught of rent increases and everything that they have faced?",102,,
914,0.97,54989.567,54993.638,In the last years.,102,,
915,0.97,54993.638,54995.273,And looking at the actual statistics.,102,,
916,0.97,54995.273,54999.878,"So just to let you know, that's our starting point as well.",102,,
917,0.97,54999.878,55000.812,It is a practical standpoint.,102,,
918,0.97,55000.812,55006.051,It may not be practical for some landlords who want to fight their tenants.,102,,
919,0.97,55006.051,55008.253,"But Unfortunately, that's the reality of what it is.",102,,
920,0.97,55008.253,55009.054,Okay.,103,,
921,0.97,55009.054,55010.588,We'll leave it there.,103,,

940,0.97,55055.0,55063.742,I think that's important to note that we haven't had these statistics.,106,,
941,0.97,55063.742,55065.443,One of the major causes for this.,106,,
942,0.97,55065.443,55078.923,"It's important that we have some statistics in the 2019 study, from the regional Council, which shows that the rent, the cost on housing or even the word rent for Renters, is the primary cause of displacement.",106,,
943,0.97,55078.923,55080.592,That's very useful to look at.,106,,

1027,0.97,55571.182,55572.35,And it's great.,115,,
1028,0.97,55572.35,55599.043,And I also wanted to note how important it is that our nominees are outspoken about the need to the need to focus on the real question about transition and how climate change affects us proportionately by the same communities that are affected by the skyrocketing rent.,115,,
1029,0.97,55599.043,55600.144,These issues are connected.,115,,

1034,0.97,55622.033,55624.335,We have four new stellar candidates here.,116,,

1038,0.97,55632.276,55634.145,And their Science-Based approach.,116,,
1039,0.97,55634.145,55652.163,"One of the things, the nice things about Dr. Emily Myers who I was on the campaign trail with her in 2019, she was a very strong advocate for having the city address climate change issues.",116,,
1040,0.97,55652.163,55658.035,And we had several strong candidates in that area like Kathy Tuttle.,116,,
1041,0.97,55658.035,55663.774,But Emily Myers was very strong bringing her science background to the campaign trail.,116,,
1042,0.97,55663.774,55667.445,And I'm really glad to see that she'll be on this board.,116,,

1046,0.97,55681.993,55690.301,I will note that the work of the advocates like we have on the board now is going to be crucial.,117,,
1047,0.97,55690.301,55696.54,Because we know that despite the pressures on Washington DC to actually do something.,117,,
1048,0.97,55696.54,55697.742,We know they're under pressure.,117,,
1049,0.97,55697.742,55702.98,We know we have seen proposals that are headed in a better direction than before.,117,,
1050,0.97,55702.98,55708.019,But we've already seen now what happened with President Biden's infrastructure bill.,117,,
1051,0.97,55708.019,55714.225,"Some of the most important components have been left behind, getting more compromised with the Republicans.",117,,
1052,0.97,55714.225,55718.462,"So it is going to be crucial, the work that you all are gonNA be doing.",117,,
1053,0.97,55718.462,55721.966,Obviously Seattle alone can't do this.,117,,
1054,0.97,55721.966,55725.002,We need advocates in every estate.,117,,
1055,0.97,55725.002,55725.903,Every city.,117,,
1056,0.97,55725.903,55728.339,But then every city does matter.,117,,
1057,0.97,55728.339,55735.413,I just wanted to appreciate the work that you all are going to be doing in that larger context.,117,,
1058,0.97,55735.413,55738.049,I'll read the four appointments into record.,117,,

1079,0.97,55860.371,55862.673,It is important that we deal with it.,124,,
1080,0.97,55862.673,55868.145,That was the last agenda item in our committee.,124,,
