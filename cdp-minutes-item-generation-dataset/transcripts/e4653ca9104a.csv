23,0.97,67.167,74.441,First I want to thank all of you for joining me and my Council colleague for this special counsel meeting.,18,,
24,0.97,74.441,84.25,The purpose of this meeting is to get an update on the city's efforts to provide hygiene efforts for people experiencing homelessness during this Covid- 19 public health crisis.,18,,
25,0.97,84.25,90.056,The conversation is especially important given the recently reported outbreak of hepatitis a in North Seattle.,18,,
26,0.97,90.056,93.693,The format of the meeting is going to consistent of two panels today.,18,,
27,0.97,93.693,104.604,The first panel is going to consistent of front line homeless service providers who are going to give an update on the hygiene issues that they are facing out in the field.,18,,
28,0.97,104.604,126.926,And following that panel we're going to be joined by the deputy Mayor as well as Ryan Kellogg and the director Patty Hayes from King County Seattle public health Department who are going to give an overview of the efforts being done to stand up with hygiene resources and the response from the city and the county.,18,,
29,0.97,126.926,131.931,Moving on to just a brief comment on public comment.,18,,
30,0.97,131.931,141.307,"Because of the technical challenges that have arisen from the necessity to meet Electronly, we do not have a way to solicit public comment on this remote meeting.",18,,
31,0.97,141.307,158.658,However I want to ensure members of the public who are listening that we welcome their comments and questions stemming from this meeting and to please E-mail Council if you do have public comment that is relevant to this Committee.,18,,

34,0.97,169.769,173.773,So moving on to our items of business.,18,,
35,0.97,173.773,179.312,"I'm going to move on to the first panel, the Presenters.",18,,
36,0.97,179.312,195.528,"I'm sure all of us know them by reputation for their diligent service in the community and in this field that I would first like to start by thanking Colleen, Allison Eisinger.",18,,
37,0.97,195.528,202.969,"Jessica Juan and don Widson from the Evergreen treatment services, and Brittany Meek from the downtown emergency service center.",18,,
38,0.97,202.969,208.074,I want to thank all of you for your service.,18,,
39,0.97,208.074,217.65,Thank you for coming here to join us this morning to provide an update on the great work you are doing out in the community.,18,,
40,0.97,217.65,248.581,"I'm going to ask each of the participants starting with Colleen then Allison then Jessica and don and then Brittany to provide a one or two-minute statement at the beginning, just an overview of the challenges you're seeing and what you guys have been up to out in the field during the Covid-19 outbreak.",18,,
41,0.97,248.581,262.095,After that I'm going to facilitate a discussion between my colleagues and the entire panel just like any other Council presentation to give an opportunity for folks to answer questions and get further Clarifications.,18,,
42,0.97,262.095,273.506,"I'm going to ask Jessica when we move on to the next panel director Hayes needs to leave by 10:50 a.m., so I want to make sure we can get to updates from her.",18,,
43,0.97,273.506,283.316,"So I want to finish our first panel discussion here by 10:30 a.m., so I would ask the people hold their questions till the end.",18,,
44,0.97,283.316,295.895,"Council colleagues, just raise your hand in the zoom boxes or send me an E-mail or a chat or a text if you want to be recognized.",18,,
45,0.97,295.895,297.73,I will keep a list.,18,,
46,0.97,297.73,304.437,So with that I want to turn it over to Colleen.,18,,
47,0.97,304.437,313.646,"Hi everybody, really glad to have this opportunity and I want to say thank you to you all for your continued support of some of the most amazing beautiful and brilliant relatives.",19,,
48,0.97,313.646,318.584,I will give you a quick glimpse of what we've been experiencing here at the chief Seattle club.,19,,
49,0.97,318.584,322.855,"I was here last Thursday, the solidarity of my team working in our day center.",19,,
50,0.97,322.855,331.364,I was at the front door when we had to tell people that we were limiting access to our bathrooms just because of social distancing.,19,,
51,0.97,331.364,333.733,Too many people too close.,19,,
52,0.97,333.733,337.837,"So we're limiting our bathrooms to four people at a time, two men and two women.",19,,
53,0.97,337.837,342.642,At the front door I saw a woman push her way to the front.,19,,
54,0.97,342.642,348.481,"Excuse me, she had tears in her eyes and she was begging me please let me in the bathroom.",19,,
55,0.97,348.481,359.025,What she told me confidentially she was Menstruating and desperate to get into a place where she could get clean.,19,,
56,0.97,359.025,364.397,"Later that day I can tell you many, many stories of just desperate need for bathrooms and showers.",19,,
57,0.97,364.397,372.004,What it was like for us to have to not limit our access to those bathrooms.,19,,
58,0.97,372.004,375.375,Later on in the day I'm heading back to my car at Pioneer square.,19,,
59,0.97,375.375,383.082,I will say being in Pioneer is surreal because we're only seeing the homeless community.,19,,
60,0.97,383.082,387.587,I'm looking outside the window right now and many of our homeless relatives are out there.,19,,
61,0.97,387.587,396.963,I was walking to my car and I had noticed when I came in that day that near my car was a file of human Feces.,19,,
62,0.97,396.963,400.733,"It had been raining, so it had moved down further.",19,,
63,0.97,400.733,402.668,I ended up actually stepping in this.,19,,
64,0.97,402.668,406.973,I want to say in Pioneer square we are seeing it everywhere.,19,,
65,0.97,406.973,411.744,Because we have so many people who are experiencing homelessness in this area.,19,,
66,0.97,411.744,417.216,"There is, if we do not have hepatitis a in this area right now I would be shocked.",19,,
67,0.97,417.216,424.39,So that is a little glimpse I want to leave plenty of time for the other panelists to share.,19,,
68,0.97,424.39,435.501,I will just say I'm really happy the city of Seattle and with the leadership of Jacob Johnson we will be getting a shower trailer and toilets near the chief Seattle club.,19,,
69,0.97,435.501,448.781,"Two extra showers, two toilets, and they will be staffing that and we are grateful for that opportunity, so thank you.",19,,
70,0.97,449.515,451.751,"Great, Colleen, thank you so much for that update.",20,,
71,0.97,451.751,453.753,Let's move on to Allison.,20,,
72,0.97,453.753,458.758,Just a reminder if everyone could hold their comments till the end of the whole panel.,20,,
73,0.97,458.758,460.092,"Allison, are you on the call?",20,,
74,0.97,460.092,460.793,I am.,21,,
75,0.97,460.793,461.828,All right.,22,,
76,0.97,461.828,463.596,"Take it away, Allison, thank you.",22,,
77,0.97,463.596,465.665,Thank you very much Council member Lewis.,23,,
78,0.97,465.665,471.103,I want to thank you and Council member President Gonzalez and your staff members.,23,,
79,0.97,471.103,473.206,Good morning to all of you Council member members.,23,,
80,0.97,473.206,490.022,Thank you for the opportunity to give you a briefing from the front lines of what is actually happening for people in our community as you heard from Colleen and as you will shortly hear from don and Jessica and Brittany.,23,,
81,0.97,490.022,500.833,What we are seeing unfold in our city is truly a shocking experience.,23,,
82,0.97,500.833,506.138,Literally the people left outside are the people left outside.,23,,
83,0.97,506.138,516.148,There are thousands of people who do not have the privilege or the luxury of being able to meet their own bodily needs on a regular dignified basis.,23,,
84,0.97,516.148,527.159,And that is contributing to their serious health Vulnerabilities as well as to presenting threats to the health of everyone.,23,,
85,0.97,527.159,540.706,I think everyone is aware of the fact there is nothing like a pandemic with highly contagious viral disease to remind people that the health of all of us is found in the help of all of us.,23,,
86,0.97,540.706,553.452,I want to share very briefly some of the work the coalition has been doing in support of the people who are experiencing homelessness and our member organizations in partnership with King County community.,23,,
87,0.97,553.452,559.392,We have been carrying out a survey of service changes across the homeless service sector.,23,,
88,0.97,559.392,568.134,And in a little over a week we had surveyed up to date 53 organizations and 116 programs.,23,,
89,0.97,568.134,571.237,And 83 of those are in Seattle.,23,,
90,0.97,571.237,581.013,We started by focusing on the day and hygiene centers because of our awareness of the acute issues related to health sanitation access.,23,,
91,0.97,581.013,591.123,What I can tell you with the exception of a couple of day centers in South King County that received some funding to provide additional hours.,23,,
92,0.97,591.123,601.901,"In all cases the hours and/or services have been reduced in part, of course, to comply with CDC and public health Seattle in King County guidelines.",23,,
93,0.97,601.901,621.22,"And as you heard from Colleen, organizations that have long and steadfast traditions of meeting the needs of vulnerability populations have Heartbreakingly had to limit access including to the services that are vital and life saving.",23,,
94,0.97,621.22,631.864,"I think everybody knows this, but it is worth seeing hepatitis a virus and the Coronavirus do not care about district boundaries.",23,,
95,0.97,631.864,634.4,They are not Jurisdictionally Compliant.,23,,
96,0.97,634.4,640.806,These are highly contagious diseases and there are only two ways to respond.,23,,
97,0.97,640.806,643.676,That is through prevention and mitigation.,23,,
98,0.97,643.676,654.387,And both prevention and mitigation require that people have access on demand to toilets and SINKS.,23,,
99,0.97,654.387,683.015,"I have a number of specific recommendations, which I will hold until later, but what I would like to say is we are interested in Partnering with the city to a greater degree than we have so far been able to, to provide specific recommendations and to do the kind of problem solving that's needed to accomplish the very specific goal, which is to ensure that everyone in this city has access to a working toilet and a way to wash their hands within at least half a mile of where they live.",23,,
100,0.97,683.015,693.592,And that is going to take some doing and it is vitally necessary and it is going to require doing much more than the city has so far been able to do.,23,,
101,0.97,693.592,708.707,"We understand there are real logistical constraints on what's happening, but I think it's quite evident that one of the things that must happen immediately is thoughtfully and strategically to reopen and staff public buildings.",23,,
102,0.97,708.707,725.257,"Because the loss of the community centers, libraries, coffee shops, and other places where people could get themselves clean is posing severe health hazards to our most vulnerable folks and to the population as a whole.",23,,
103,0.97,725.257,727.86,Thank you.,23,,
104,0.97,727.86,731.063,"Allison, thank you so much for those comments.",24,,
105,0.97,731.063,738.471,I want to move on to Jessica and dawn.,24,,
106,0.97,738.471,747.98,"I don't know who wants to go first or if you have a joint presentation, but I will turn it over to you guys.",24,,
107,0.97,747.98,749.849,"Hi, my name is Jessica.",25,,
108,0.97,749.849,752.585,I guess I will go first.,25,,
109,0.97,752.585,756.355,I think dawn was trying to talk.,26,,
110,0.97,756.355,758.39,"All right, go ahead.",27,,
111,0.97,758.39,759.158,Okay.,28,,
112,0.97,759.158,760.793,Thanks.,28,,
113,0.97,760.793,766.765,And so my name is Jessica Kwan for Chinatown International district.,28,,
114,0.97,766.765,771.403,Thank you everybody so much for having me.,28,,
115,0.97,771.403,789.321,"So in the Cid what I do is as of when this pandemic hit my role now is kind of pretty much be on the front lines, assessing if anybody has Covid, Connectng them to the right resources if they do.",28,,
116,0.97,789.321,800.733,"Informing them about Covid symptoms and information, informing them on changes of information with the navigation team, the cleans, the policies of the city, the governor.",28,,
117,0.97,800.733,809.008,What is going on with the businesses and the community because they just have no way of getting that Inforation at all.,28,,
118,0.97,809.008,815.414,I have partnered up with food banks to help deliver food.,28,,
119,0.97,815.414,832.064,All to the people who are unsheltered because a lot of food banks have closed or they don't have capacity to follow the CDC guidelines and social distancing such as putting Útheir health and danger when they do access these services.,28,,
120,0.97,832.064,837.736,And so sorry.,28,,
121,0.97,837.736,838.17,A little nervous.,28,,
122,0.97,838.17,840.139,There are so many people on here.,28,,
123,0.97,840.139,843.976,You're doing great.,29,,
124,0.97,843.976,866.165,"Yeah so with Partnering up with the food banks we're still going on outreach, and giving people the essential things they need like soap, hand Sanitizers, food, water, Wipes, and asking what is it that you're needing right now.",30,,
125,0.97,866.165,871.136,"You know it's the same as it was before, which they want shelter.",30,,
126,0.97,871.136,876.775,I'm sure everyone knows about the situation going on with the shelters or none of that.,30,,
127,0.97,876.775,889.021,"They want access to shower and bathrooms and they want to be warm and they want help in working towards their goal, which is ultimately housing.",30,,
128,0.97,889.021,892.491,But Yeah that's what I do now.,30,,
129,0.97,892.491,918.25,"I feel like this was an issue before the whole pandemic has happened, that there were no bathrooms in the Cid Besides resources where you have to be a client to use their bathroom where there is a public library if you are barred there because of behavioral health issues or substance abuse issues that you're not able to go there for a month's time.",30,,
130,0.97,918.25,921.754,And I--a part of my job is also connecting with the businesses.,30,,
131,0.97,921.754,951.35,"I work with the Via closely, kind of like a community liaison with the residents, the businesses, and the homelessness population to spread information, understanding, and also hear their concerns, and try to solve and help where I can.",30,,
132,0.97,951.35,961.627,With businesses for instance a business shared with me his concerns and showed VIDO of people going behind his Dumpster.,30,,
133,0.97,961.627,965.03,In the morning when he goes to work he's the one that has to clean it up.,30,,
134,0.97,965.03,987.619,"For me it's extremely sad and horrifying that people have to see this person having to survive in this way, but also hearing how frustrated the business owner was with how Itaffects his business and what he has to do and how it is affecting him.",30,,
135,0.97,987.619,990.723,And the people and the customers that come in as well.,30,,
136,0.97,990.723,999.398,"And how he would like to go to city Council and talk to you guys about this, but because he's working he doesn't have the time to.",30,,
137,0.97,999.398,1009.508,And how he talked to me about it was super helpful and I'm here to advocate for the community as well as a whole.,30,,
138,0.97,1009.508,1019.852,"I guess as a social worker and someone who goes out there and meets with people who are experiencing homelessness, and all of them, not one of them.",30,,
139,0.97,1019.852,1032.131,Have experienced so much challenges and pain in their life and struggle that when they ask me where can I go and use the bathroom or can I get shelter and my answer is I don't have that.,30,,
140,0.97,1032.131,1035.901,That resource is something I'm hired to give and I don't have that.,30,,
141,0.97,1035.901,1037.669,Especially right now.,30,,
142,0.97,1037.669,1047.479,There's so many people out there who have other chronic illnesses and other conditions that make them even more vulnerable during this time.,30,,
143,0.97,1047.479,1054.486,It is just really sad.,30,,
144,0.97,1054.486,1080.512,"So Yeah I'm hoping to really hear the needs of the population, how it is affecting our entire community on a greater scale, what social workers are going through, and secondhand trauma we experience and advocating for our entire community, and that I'm here to help and collaborate in any way I can to get these needs met",30,,
145,0.97,1080.813,1083.215,"Jessica, thank you so much.",31,,
146,0.97,1083.215,1085.317,Is there anything you want to add?,31,,
147,0.97,1085.317,1092.291,"Yeah, actually, so I just want to echo the same job description.",32,,
148,0.97,1092.291,1103.102,"I am an outreach case manager in the Georgetown area, which is an area that already had limited access to community resources for hygiene.",32,,
149,0.97,1103.102,1112.945,"And in fact the Georgetown Playfield does have a Restroom there, but at times they are just told it's closed for no apparent reason.",32,,
150,0.97,1112.945,1118.75,And I know I have gone into that bathroom and it is not stocked with toilet paper and it doesn't have soap there.,32,,
151,0.97,1118.75,1123.589,And so I have been recently handing out toilet paper to clients.,32,,
152,0.97,1123.589,1132.764,"But in this area places like McDonald's, Starbucks, the gas stations that serve food are required usually to allow access to their bathrooms.",32,,
153,0.97,1132.764,1135.767,Those are no longer accessible to anyone.,32,,
154,0.97,1135.767,1144.943,I actually have been out in the field and have had to use the Restroom in several different alleys myself.,32,,
155,0.97,1144.943,1158.29,"Because even the places that wouldn't, you know, like some of the other places that wouldn't allow our homeless population to use the bathrooms, but let me use it is not an option anymore.",32,,
156,0.97,1158.29,1181.88,"And what I'm hearing from the people I'm talking to, our clients are expressing to me is tremendous fear that the CDC, the governor, Governor Inslee has directed people to shelter in place, to practice social distancing, Wash their hands regularly, which are the things that are going to save lives, yet these people know they do not have that option.",32,,
157,0.97,1181.88,1190.455,"They have multiple people in very small tents in order to survive, and they have zero access to water of any kind.",32,,
158,0.97,1190.455,1202.234,The police even in the last few months have started arresting people who were Accessing like large sides of the business building.,32,,
159,0.97,1202.234,1205.037,That's not even an option for them.,32,,
160,0.97,1205.037,1219.851,"But to walk up to an encampment and have a female client come out of the tent who had not been willing to leave her tent, she said since the day before because she had blood all the way down her pants.",32,,
161,0.97,1219.851,1225.257,She had no other pants or clothing available to her and no way to clean herself up.,32,,
162,0.97,1225.257,1232.764,"I actually had a personal pair of extra Sweats in my car, which is what I had to give her because I couldn't go to goodwill to get her something else.",32,,
163,0.97,1232.764,1239.871,"But I still didn't have any way, other than some bottles of water to give her to clean up after herself.",32,,
164,0.97,1239.871,1255.687,"And these are clients that we know have compromised immune systems, this population has complicated medical conditions, and they already are very resistant to going and seeking medical attention because they get treated terribly.",32,,
165,0.97,1255.687,1263.762,"And so hearing that anywhere in the country in the world is Triaging patients, and making decisions about who lives and who dies.",32,,
166,0.97,1263.762,1270.802,Like my clients already feel like they do not stand a chance.,32,,
167,0.97,1270.802,1286.018,"I feel like it's Arguable that, it's Arguable that being able to use the Restroom and to be able to wash your hands is just as valid and essential of a human right as getting food.",32,,
168,0.97,1286.018,1300.332,"I know the food Bank down in Georgetown, the manager there just let me know he signed up to have two National Guard members come and help volunteer to replace some of the older volunteer staff that are choosing not to be in that space right now.",32,,
169,0.97,1300.332,1309.341,And I don't see any reason why the National Guard if Logistically being able to staff locations for bathrooms is an issue.,32,,
170,0.97,1309.341,1322.521,"I don't see any reason why the National Guard shouldn't with used in that response either if they are suppose to be, you know, American soldiers on American soil.",32,,
171,0.97,1322.521,1325.524,They could definitely be used in that manner.,32,,
172,0.97,1325.524,1328.46,I me everyone is short staffed right now.,32,,
173,0.97,1328.46,1345.977,But it just doesn't seem like providing a means for people to try to help themselves to empower them to be even remotely autonomous in managing their health during this crisis.,32,,
174,0.97,1345.977,1348.814,I just don't feel like it's that much to ask.,32,,
175,0.97,1348.814,1370.001,"I know the city has a whole lot going on, but you know I also had a woman that was out walking around in Georgetwn with her dog that was complaining she's afraid to walk her dog because there's so much human waste on the streets, that's in the parks that are in that area, even in the play field.",32,,
176,0.97,1370.001,1383.915,And so the community members in that area are also seeing and feeling the threat of this lack of hygiene availability.,32,,
177,0.97,1383.915,1393.759,"And it is just, it just doesn't feel like we have any excuse, like I don't feel like there is an excuse for these human beings to not feel like they have a chance at all.",32,,
178,0.97,1393.759,1395.627,That's really all I've got.,32,,
179,0.97,1395.627,1397.229,"All right, dawn, thank you so much.",33,,
180,0.97,1397.229,1406.238,"And I want to take a moment to recognize that Council member Sawant has joined the committee, so thank you Council member Sawant, welcome.",33,,
181,0.97,1406.238,1407.539,Good to have you here.,33,,
182,0.97,1407.539,1416.248,I want to move on to our last Panelist Brittany Meek just as a remind for you have questions for the Panelist send them my way by text or E-mail.,33,,
183,0.97,1416.248,1419.951,"Brittany, why don't you take it away.",33,,
184,0.97,1419.951,1420.919,All right.,34,,
185,0.97,1420.919,1424.89,My name is Brittany Meek.,34,,
186,0.97,1424.89,1427.759,I'm a senior manager for handful of clinical programs.,34,,
187,0.97,1427.759,1434.866,Four of those programs are outreach programs and one program is a step down from in patient psychiatric care.,34,,
188,0.97,1434.866,1437.102,I'm on the clinical side of things.,34,,
189,0.97,1437.102,1443.408,My perspective on hygiene issue is relatively basic and it's going to be echoing a lot of what my colleagues have said.,34,,
190,0.97,1443.408,1445.777,There are very few public bathrooms.,34,,
191,0.97,1445.777,1451.316,The ones open to public oftentimes don't have adequate supplies for proper hygiene.,34,,
192,0.97,1451.316,1456.488,We are seeing a particular need in the South Seattle end.,34,,
193,0.97,1456.488,1464.83,"We have even had like dawn mentioned, we've had staff not be able to locate bathroom when Outreaching in the community or businesses are turning them away.",34,,
194,0.97,1464.83,1475.574,"We have encountered parks and Rec and they directed us to Porta-Potties, which is fine, but doesn't have the capability to wash hands properly and do proper hand hygiene.",34,,
195,0.97,1475.574,1481.346,"We're asking individuals to maintain hygiene and Self- isolate, but we were not given adequate assets in the means to do so.",34,,
196,0.97,1481.346,1496.728,The need is such that we need to find ways to get folks indoors and Non-Congregate settings or the way to individually instead of having to partner up.,34,,
197,0.97,1496.728,1502.934,This is a special skill set for the best of the situations and safe to say we're not in the best of the situations right now.,34,,
198,0.97,1502.934,1508.54,We have folks who are truly experiencing homelessness for the first time by living on the streets.,34,,
199,0.97,1508.54,1514.546,"And because we see shelters, day centers, other places that are closing or reducing capacity.",34,,
200,0.97,1514.546,1522.287,Places where folks previously found refuge are no longer an option and forced to live quick and hard with little to no resources.,34,,
201,0.97,1522.287,1532.564,Outreach teams are being put in that difficult spot to try to maintain dignity for folks in the community while also trying to support them on how to maintain the Cleanliness when using the Restrooms outside.,34,,
202,0.97,1532.564,1536.468,I am very interested in how we could collaborate and adjust these issues.,34,,
203,0.97,1536.468,1546.244,"I will not take up more time because a lot of my colleagues have covered everything, but I'm very much looking forward to how to resolve some of these issues because I think together we can.",34,,
204,0.97,1546.244,1548.947,"All right, thank you so much.",35,,
205,0.97,1548.947,1553.952,And so I see the director Hayes has joined us.,35,,
206,0.97,1553.952,1557.088,I intended to start four minutes with the director.,35,,
207,0.97,1557.088,1573.338,Why don't we ask a few questions for the panel and maybe if folks want to stick around until after director Hayes presentation we can come back and take a few more from the first panel before moving on to the executive.,35,,
208,0.97,1573.338,1575.34,So I think that's the way I want to do it.,35,,
209,0.97,1575.34,1580.512,If there is more interest after our initial questions for some of the panel members.,35,,
210,0.97,1580.512,1590.422,"Council member Mosqueda indicated she had a question, I will recognize her now.",35,,
211,0.97,1590.422,1598.43,Thank you chair Lewis and thank you all for being on the meeting line here today.,36,,
212,0.97,1598.43,1610.575,I can't begin to explain how appalled I am that you are having to work with so little resources.,36,,
213,0.97,1610.575,1618.783,"And obviously we are all trying to row in the same boat here, I hope, and we want to get you the services and the resources you need.",36,,
214,0.97,1618.783,1634.099,"My big question is if you can underscore the ask around community center as Allison knows I have been trying my best to figure out if we, the city, can purchase hand washing facilities and get those out to organizations ourselves, recognizing our city is working as fast as they can.",36,,
215,0.97,1634.099,1636.668,Obviously there are people being pulled in a number of directions.,36,,
216,0.97,1636.668,1640.739,If we were to purchase those and get those out to the coalition is one question I have.,36,,
217,0.97,1640.739,1642.674,It doesn't sound like we're able to do that.,36,,
218,0.97,1642.674,1667.165,"So the ask I heard from you from various Presenters, open up some of the community resources, staff those with the military personnel that are here, make sure that folks are feeling comfortable using the bathrooms, the showers, the hand washing facilities, and have the folks who have been deployed to this area to help participate in making sure those bathrooms, hand washing facilities, and showers are open.",36,,
219,0.97,1667.165,1672.804,In addition to anything else we could do to get more hand washing and showers deployed across the city.,36,,
220,0.97,1672.804,1677.509,Is there anything you would add to that or correct if that is a part of the ask?,36,,
221,0.97,1677.509,1680.211,"Council member Mosqueda, I would love to add to that.",37,,
222,0.97,1680.211,1685.617,I think we need to have multi- Prong solutions right now.,37,,
223,0.97,1685.617,1687.886,I'm aware of the community centers.,37,,
224,0.97,1687.886,1690.955,And I don't know if there is enough bathrooms there.,37,,
225,0.97,1690.955,1703.835,"There's not enough bathrooms there, so we have to do other things, I think we could do things like the mark Lloyd solution, which is providing temporary toilets out in Encampments.",37,,
226,0.97,1703.835,1706.538,We need more Porta-Potties and more of the trailers.,37,,
227,0.97,1706.538,1709.374,We need to open up other public buildings and staff those.,37,,
228,0.97,1709.374,1716.848,I also want to acknowledge though our homeless relatives have some special needs that need to be thawed out.,37,,
229,0.97,1716.848,1725.323,"Whoever is staffing them are being very trauma aware, focused on the really significant issues of trauma they're experiencing.",37,,
230,0.97,1725.323,1728.827,I want to flag this is a crisis for all of us.,37,,
231,0.97,1728.827,1731.93,"Many people feel anxious and stressed, I certainly do.",37,,
232,0.97,1731.93,1737.235,"But if you're homeless, you're experiencing a severe race of trauma right now.",37,,
233,0.97,1737.235,1742.574,"So it is a very important thing for us to have that lens moving forward, so we can be effective.",37,,
234,0.97,1742.574,1751.049,"I agree with you Council member Mosqueda on the community centers, but I think there has to be a much broader scope as well.",37,,
235,0.97,1751.049,1754.018,"Yes, if I could build on what Colleen said.",38,,
236,0.97,1754.018,1779.911,"I think we have actually a list of suggested sites and buildings as well as we've done some thinking through a couple of areas that could be used to evaluate public buildings and potentially private building should owners, folks who own gyms want to participate.",38,,
237,0.97,1779.911,1783.915,And what I think we need is multiple toilets and multiple SINKS.,38,,
238,0.97,1783.915,1798.83,"What I have been saying to people is in the absence of enough Porta-Potties and hand washing stations, really what's clear is we already have publicly bought and paid for hand washing stations.",38,,
239,0.97,1798.83,1799.831,They're called SINKS.,38,,
240,0.97,1799.831,1805.336,"When you have bathrooms that have multiple stalls and SINKS available, we can do things.",38,,
241,0.97,1805.336,1816.614,"We can think about this creatively like there are libraries that were, of course, essentially the biggest day center collectively of our entire community.",38,,
242,0.97,1816.614,1829.928,But there are libraries as well as community centers and other public buildings with accessible toilets on the main floor that could be access without Accessing the rest of the building.,38,,
243,0.97,1829.928,1834.465,There are places that also have access to showers.,38,,
244,0.97,1834.465,1850.949,I've heard from some members of the disability community that even the Ada accessible Porta- Potties that have been put out in some places are not fully accessible in part because of how they have been installed or because they are foot pedal operated.,38,,
245,0.97,1850.949,1855.987,What we have again are public facilities that are built and designed to be Ada Compliant.,38,,
246,0.97,1855.987,1872.904,"And so I think there is a lot of opportunity that again I want to underscore libraries and community centers, but they are not necessarily the only public buildings in addition because as Colleen said we need a Multi-Pronged approach, and then just to the point of deploying the National guard.",38,,
247,0.97,1872.904,1882.747,I have been trying as Council member Mosqueda knows and some others for weeks to propose this in the spirit of those people being citizen soldiers.,38,,
248,0.97,1882.747,1899.897,We want them not in uniform and we want them to be deployed as a supplement skilled knowledgeable staff in other places because service providers are so stretched thin in terms of their staffing.,38,,
249,0.97,1899.897,1901.766,Colleen is 100%.,38,,
250,0.97,1901.766,1909.04,These are circumstances that are trying for people who can get a good night's sleep and who can use a bathroom whenever we need to.,38,,
251,0.97,1909.04,1918.449,"And so for folks who are experiencing homelessness, we need to make sure we are appropriately providing staffing and support.",38,,
252,0.97,1918.449,1923.655,But the food Bank example is such an important one.,38,,
253,0.97,1923.655,1934.966,"I think Jessica who said, you know, people need access, sort of on both ends of the human spectrum.",38,,
254,0.97,1934.966,1942.941,We can't pretend staffing food banks is appropriate if we're not also providing places for people once the food has passed through their digestive system.,38,,
255,0.97,1942.941,1947.478,So I think it is completely doable.,38,,
256,0.97,1947.478,1954.819,"I think there are probably folks who are currently furloughed, folks from local business improvement associations.",38,,
257,0.97,1954.819,1957.689,People who are not employed in the restaurant business.,38,,
258,0.97,1957.689,1963.428,Who have skills and heart and willingness to provide additional support.,38,,
259,0.97,1963.428,1972.603,"They will need some training and they will need just like homeless service workers need personal protective equipment, which for the most part is not currently available.",38,,
260,0.97,1972.603,1974.639,"Right on Allison, thank you so much.",39,,
261,0.97,1974.639,1993.224,"So we have a few more questions for the provider panel, but since we're getting kind of close to director Hayes being unavailable, I want to Pivot to director Hayes presentation and then come back if our provider panel is happy to stick around, so they can answer a few more questions from Council members.",39,,
262,0.97,1993.224,1998.763,"I'm seeing some head Noddings, that's good.",39,,
263,0.97,1998.763,1999.03,Perfect.,39,,
264,0.97,1999.03,2011.909,"Director Hayes, I want to just move on O and take you out of order here to make sure you can get back to the hard work of leading our public health response here on Covid-19.",39,,
265,0.97,2011.909,2014.445,Thank you for coming to our committee.,39,,
266,0.97,2014.445,2019.417,I would ask folks to hold their questions for director Hayes till the end of her presentation.,39,,
267,0.97,2019.417,2024.389,And then we will go back to the provider of panels.,39,,
268,0.97,2024.389,2029.727,"So director Hayes, with that I'll turn it over to you.",39,,
269,0.97,2029.727,2049.814,"The general areas of interest as my staff made aware in communications, you know, responses to the hepatitis a outbreak, some of the general regional efforts, public health has been making around hygiene, and we appreciate hearing from you and having you before this Committee, so take it away.",39,,
270,0.97,2049.814,2053.684,Thank you so much.,40,,
271,0.97,2053.684,2056.654,I appreciate being invited.,40,,
272,0.97,2056.654,2070.268,"And in the preservation of time, I'll do all the presentation of my staff, Ryan Kellogg is here if there are any Technicalquestions that might come up.",40,,
273,0.97,2070.268,2073.438,We'll make this so it will fit in your time frame.,40,,
274,0.97,2073.438,2078.209,Thank you so much and I'm glad I was able to listen to the community.,40,,
275,0.97,2078.209,2081.646,It is important to hear from the community.,40,,
276,0.97,2081.646,2101.332,"Let me start by saying just a moment about the outreach because this outbreak is causing both all the stress you heard about, all the issues of community mitigation that have the consequences that are emerging for the Council and the city are trying to deal with.",40,,
277,0.97,2101.332,2108.206,We are thanks to all of your work and all of your health beginning to see the curve.,40,,
278,0.97,2108.206,2120.651,But I want the Council to understand even though you'll see a lot of chatter in the media and a lot of debate now about when we can move off community mitigation.,40,,
279,0.97,2120.651,2125.056,We are beginning those conversations with the Department of health nationally.,40,,
280,0.97,2125.056,2130.161,"But when you bend the curb, you extend it out.",40,,
281,0.97,2130.161,2138.669,And I think we need to be thinking about this over a longer time.,40,,
282,0.97,2138.669,2140.505,If I could just start with that.,40,,
283,0.97,2140.505,2144.308,I know many of you are looking at modeling around the outbreak.,40,,
284,0.97,2144.308,2155.953,Just remember some of those models fits more on the best case scenario and some are the worst case.,40,,
285,0.97,2155.953,2165.496,With that let me Pivot and go into the hygiene sanitation overview I want to give for you.,40,,
286,0.97,2165.496,2171.435,I'm pleased our environment health team last fall put together.,40,,
287,0.97,2171.435,2179.977,We launched in January the health and sanitation guidelines that I know that I talked to you all about.,40,,
288,0.97,2179.977,2196.427,I want to remind you and the community because these are the big guidelines that hold whether or not it's hepatitis a or Covid that are so important and reference many things you're talking about.,40,,
289,0.97,2196.427,2203.1,"So I was grateful to launch this in the community, hopes they could respond to that.",40,,
290,0.97,2203.1,2206.837,So this is still our guiding document.,40,,
291,0.97,2206.837,2209.14,They're working with the city.,40,,
292,0.97,2209.14,2214.946,So Council member Mosqueda for the support on that and this guideline is the first of its kind.,40,,
293,0.97,2214.946,2227.024,The Council needs to recognize that there are no national guidelines that will fit for Covid in the base of the personal experiencing homeless.,40,,
294,0.97,2227.024,2243.774,"That we are now working nationally and looking at what our guidance and there are other areas of the country that we were talking with who are looking at and using our guidelines, but Oh looking in the reality of Covid.",40,,
295,0.97,2243.774,2251.882,What do we need to do and how do we need to create the guidance specifically in this area?,40,,
296,0.97,2251.882,2253.384,The document is Online.,40,,
297,0.97,2253.384,2257.188,We can get that back out to Council.,40,,
298,0.97,2257.188,2264.295,But right now as you've heard and you know we don't have one outbreak at a time.,40,,
299,0.97,2264.295,2275.206,So the spread of hepatitis a and the Coronavirus within the homeless population as I Prioritize for public health Seattle building.,40,,
300,0.97,2275.206,2284.115,We have a team approach to this with the high strike teams that are working in the different shelters right now.,40,,
301,0.97,2284.115,2290.021,I'm pleased we haven't had as large of an outbreak as other jurisdictions have had in this area.,40,,
302,0.97,2290.021,2301.432,I think that's a sign of the great work with the Council with the community and with other elected officials and I just want to take a deep note of gratitude about that.,40,,
303,0.97,2301.432,2307.138,And that does not mean turn the corner and it does not mean we can't do better.,40,,
304,0.97,2307.138,2326.157,The CDC guidance to reduce the spread particularly of Covid and other community diseases as you know it is really going to emphasize frequent hand washing with soap and water and we know Covid is spread more through droplets.,40,,
305,0.97,2326.157,2333.264,Hepatitis a is spread through fecal oral transmission.,40,,
306,0.97,2333.264,2351.282,So on the hepatitis a about a year I came to you talking about the beginning of seeing hepatitis A. and thanks to Council member Strauss for the work around the needs of folks around the park.,40,,
307,0.97,2351.282,2362.66,But since that time I first noted it had threat of hepatitis A. we've had 107 confirmed cases of hepatitis a since March of this year.,40,,
308,0.97,2362.66,2367.398,We've identified 30 confirmed hepatitis a cases.,40,,
309,0.97,2367.398,2370.735,14 of those reported living homeless in Ballard areas.,40,,
310,0.97,2370.735,2376.807,But we haven't identified a common link to all of those at this point.,40,,
311,0.97,2376.807,2381.212,But it's a reality that they are up in the Ballard area.,40,,
312,0.97,2381.212,2405.402,"As part of our response, new cases in the Ballard area are environmental Helpings that have been working with parks and Rec to talk about what best practice for this is at the Portland lieu, at the Seattle Commons, and the most important thing for hepatitis a, which we don't have Covid as you all know is vaccination.",40,,
313,0.97,2405.402,2414.912,We've mobilized several clinics in the Ballard area in March and will continue to do that through April and beyond working with Street outreach.,40,,
314,0.97,2414.912,2419.25,This is a part of the broader vaccination push we're doing on this.,40,,
315,0.97,2419.25,2435.065,"We see we need to do two-year Sprints on the vaccination and reevaluate where we are at with hepatitis a, but I will say it really complicates it because with the community mitigation you just heard the fallout from the community mitigation.",40,,
316,0.97,2435.065,2443.874,And so we do need to be creative and how to work together.,40,,
317,0.97,2443.874,2462.693,"So on that sanitation need, both of these outbreaks we've worked with the city and many of you to encourage the increase additive to the facilities where folks could wash their hands, use the toilet, then shower.",40,,
318,0.97,2462.693,2471.702,Priorities should be placed on the access to hand washing followed by the toilets and then shower facilities.,40,,
319,0.97,2471.702,2473.37,I may often get that question.,40,,
320,0.97,2473.37,2492.022,"You know to provide this increase access, we do think that really exams, where there are bathrooms and where we need to focus Portables is all a part of that and I think you have heard from the community.",40,,
321,0.97,2492.022,2514.378,"I think that geographic areas, where we know there are such access E points to existing bathrooms can allow the city to deploy whatever types of Porta- Potties and other nodes of the areas to be efficient.",40,,
322,0.97,2514.378,2519.717,It is important work just as we are all doing to get that idea and best access.,40,,
323,0.97,2519.717,2528.025,And what I will say for the specific recommendations we're doing for the heightened facilities.,40,,
324,0.97,2528.025,2535.466,We're developing cleaning guidance and sanitation standards for both mobile and fixed facilities.,40,,
325,0.97,2535.466,2541.605,We have been in contact with other areas around the country who are trying to grapple with this themselves.,40,,
326,0.97,2541.605,2548.279,We know a need for personal protective equipment for cleaning staff and what kind of specific chemicals to recommend.,40,,
327,0.97,2548.279,2563.394,"In addition our guidance will include what we think for staff facilities and a level to ensure successful operations, which I know could be really challenging.",40,,
328,0.97,2563.394,2569.066,It is a day as to how frequently things need to be cleaned.,40,,
329,0.97,2569.066,2577.708,So our guidance is going with the city to look to do what we believe our best practices in different environments.,40,,
330,0.97,2577.708,2581.245,Not all of these environments are all the same.,40,,
331,0.97,2581.245,2590.821,We will work with them on that and community partners on their idea.,40,,
332,0.97,2590.821,2596.327,We appreciate the Council's happenings.,40,,
333,0.97,2596.327,2607.137,"And I look forward to coming back and presenting more as we move forward with our guidance, testing that guidance, and improving it.",40,,
334,0.97,2607.137,2608.906,I will go back to you chair.,40,,
335,0.97,2608.906,2611.175,Thank you so much director Hayes.,41,,
336,0.97,2611.175,2615.446,We do have a couple of questions.,41,,
337,0.97,2615.446,2618.549,First Council member Morales has a question.,41,,
338,0.97,2618.549,2620.851,So the chair recognizes Council member Morales.,41,,
339,0.97,2620.851,2622.252,Thank you.,42,,
340,0.97,2622.252,2626.39,"Thank you, director Hayes.",42,,
341,0.97,2626.39,2631.362,"You began to answer my question, which is about vaccination.",42,,
342,0.97,2631.362,2641.905,"Of course we know the transmission is easy, to heat food and wash hands.",42,,
343,0.97,2641.905,2651.982,"Particularly in this population if they already have hepatitis C, then liver failure is a death sentence.",42,,
344,0.97,2651.982,2667.898,"And so I appreciate understanding that, you know, you're Ramping up or trying to ramp up vaccination for hepatitis A. can you talk a little bit more about what you mean by a two-year Sprint and where are you?",42,,
345,0.97,2667.898,2670.801,And then your ability to serve the community as it is.,42,,
346,0.97,2670.801,2673.203,"Right, thank you for that question.",43,,
347,0.97,2673.203,2677.708,So we are one year in our Two- year Sprint.,43,,
348,0.97,2677.708,2689.119,"So the Epidemiology hepatitis a with our physician, Epidemiologists have set that time frame for when a concentrated effort needs to be done.",43,,
349,0.97,2689.119,2691.889,So we are one year into that.,43,,
350,0.97,2691.889,2697.494,"We've given over 2,000 and given even more vaccines out there.",43,,
351,0.97,2697.494,2710.607,One of the things that we could use with at all times and through our community partners is when we go out W█E offer the vaccination.,43,,
352,0.97,2710.607,2714.511,Life was noted by our partners.,43,,
353,0.97,2714.511,2716.88,Folks are under a stress ten times.,43,,
354,0.97,2716.88,2720.717,It is not easy to lean in and say yes.,43,,
355,0.97,2720.717,2726.89,So I think that could be a help that we could put those messages on out and the communities that this is important.,43,,
356,0.97,2726.89,2733.363,And the other challenge for folks who are living homeless is that they need to have two vaccines.,43,,
357,0.97,2733.363,2735.165,And that is hard.,43,,
358,0.97,2735.165,2747.978,"So we keep a record of who we have given those vaccines to and we try and make sure we could pull up with them in that time that is away, but it could combat and it is hard when those folks are mobile.",43,,
359,0.97,2747.978,2753.751,And their lives are so chaotic that the last thing they're thinking about is that second vaccine.,43,,
360,0.97,2753.751,2755.819,Any help from partners?,44,,
361,0.97,2755.819,2758.755,Their messages that they could put out about that?,44,,
362,0.97,2758.755,2764.862,So that we could have welcoming environment and safe environments that would be it?,44,,
363,0.97,2764.862,2768.298,"Thank you, council.",44,,
364,0.97,2768.298,2772.436,"Okay, any other questions for director Hayes?",45,,
365,0.97,2772.436,2780.11,Looking at my colleagues pictures here.,45,,
366,0.97,2780.11,2783.614,"It looks like director Hayes, that was very quick.",45,,
367,0.97,2783.614,2784.815,Thank you so much.,46,,
368,0.97,2784.815,2792.489,"I'm sorry I have to run off, but I'm going to be speaking with Arp and delivering key messages to them too.",46,,
369,0.97,2792.489,2800.964,"So I just wanted to take a moment and thank you all again, helping me stay the course of this.",46,,
370,0.97,2800.964,2806.37,We have one of the best responses around the country with the community mitigation.,46,,
371,0.97,2806.37,2807.538,And we need to keep that.,46,,
372,0.97,2807.538,2812.242,"You are such a big part of it, so thank you.",46,,
373,0.97,2812.242,2813.977,"Lewis, may I ask a question?",47,,
374,0.97,2813.977,2815.946,"Yes, council member Mosqueda.",48,,
375,0.97,2815.946,2817.347,"Director Hayes, thank you so much.",49,,
376,0.97,2817.347,2819.85,I know you have two minutes left.,49,,
377,0.97,2819.85,2832.296,"Just very briefly, you mentioned the Timeline for recommendations for getting the locations and additional requests for hand washing facilities out the door and more, showers and toilets out the door.",49,,
378,0.97,2832.296,2837.568,"Can you remind us what the Timeline is for that, so we can take those recommendations and run with them?",49,,
379,0.97,2837.568,2845.542,"Yeah, so we are finishing those up real time this week into next week, so they're coming Imminently.",50,,
380,0.97,2845.542,2847.544,Thank you as well for all you're doing.,51,,
381,0.97,2847.544,2848.278,Thank you.,52,,
382,0.97,2848.278,2850.781,Great.,53,,
383,0.97,2850.781,2854.885,Thank you for that question Council member Mosqueda.,53,,
384,0.97,2854.885,2861.892,Moving back now to the provider panel.,53,,
385,0.97,2861.892,2868.398,Thanks everyone for your indulgence for taking director Hayes out of order to get that update and presentation in.,53,,
386,0.97,2868.398,2871.568,And I wanted to go back to those questions.,53,,
387,0.97,2871.568,2876.039,And finish up before we move on to deputy Mayor.,53,,
388,0.97,2876.039,2878.976,So Council member Morales was next on my list.,53,,
389,0.97,2878.976,2883.981,"Ask a question to the provided panel, so the chair recognizes Council member Morales.",53,,
390,0.97,2883.981,2885.215,Thank you.,54,,
391,0.97,2885.215,2891.188,I want to thank all the service providers for being here this morning.,54,,
392,0.97,2891.188,2893.156,It is really hard to hear.,54,,
393,0.97,2893.156,2915.746,"We know this is happening, but to hear about, you know, folks who are unable to get in to the bathrooms to do something basic as clean up menstruation who are Soiling themselves in the streets, who are, you know, having a hard time meeting the most basic human need is really hard.",54,,
394,0.97,2915.746,2925.756,"And so I know that all of you are also experiencing trauma from having to deal with this, so thank you for that work that you're doing.",54,,
395,0.97,2925.756,2933.263,We want to acknowledge that the need to protect public health by increasing bathrooms is critical.,54,,
396,0.97,2933.263,2940.137,And figure out this question of how we protect workers who are needed to clean these facilities.,54,,
397,0.97,2940.137,2951.181,I'm really interested in following up on the issue of trying to get National Guard folks in to do it in a way that is compassionate and that serves that need.,54,,
398,0.97,2951.181,2954.785,We have to do both.,54,,
399,0.97,2954.785,2966.596,So I'm interested in understanding how the city worked with you to place the hygiene stations that we do have.,54,,
400,0.97,2966.596,2971.768,"And knowing that in L.A., for example, they have 360 portable hand washing stations.",54,,
401,0.97,2971.768,2986.383,If you have any sense of how many we should have for the population that we have here.,54,,
402,0.97,2986.383,2990.253,I'll leave that open for Whoever wants to answer it.,54,,
403,0.97,2990.253,2995.892,So Yeah I sent out an E-mail to the Covid homeless response.,55,,
404,0.97,2995.892,3002.432,I was really appreciative about the response that I got back.,55,,
405,0.97,3002.432,3011.441,"Tom Van Bronsworth or something like that, he responded back and a few other city officials or people from the city also responded back to me.",55,,
406,0.97,3011.441,3015.645,We were able to have all the phone conversations.,55,,
407,0.97,3015.645,3027.924,"And also at reach in particular on our outreach team we have Bie outreach workers, where we will have a partnership with each outreach worker designated to that community.",55,,
408,0.97,3027.924,3042.773,"We have one in Ballard and so people will show you the cap Hill, the water front, Georgetown, and the Seattle outreach team, that will also hit up North down South and Kent and Renneton.",55,,
409,0.97,3042.773,3073.97,"And so with that, with our team we are able to really coordinate with each other and assist specifically get the locations in those communities, where we think it will be best and easily accessible and where the population will stay with that or the hot spots of where people like to camp at and the need specifically to the community.",55,,
410,0.97,3073.97,3077.908,I gave a list to Allison to talk more about that as well.,55,,
411,0.97,3077.908,3079.91,Yeah.,56,,
412,0.97,3079.91,3087.584,"Allison, just before you begin, I ask because dawn and Jessica both mentioned that there is a greater need in South Seattle.",56,,
413,0.97,3087.584,3100.063,And so I'm trying to understand how these decisions were made and what communications you had that were or were not getting what they needed.,56,,
414,0.97,3100.063,3110.34,This is dawn from reach.,57,,
415,0.97,3110.34,3119.85,"And the discussion initially was, well I guess initially we were told that there were going to be a lot.",57,,
416,0.97,3119.85,3123.153,"Porta-Potties, hand washing stations that were going to be deployed around the city.",57,,
417,0.97,3123.153,3134.364,We were asked for lists of areas that we felt like would be the highest traffic areas that would get the most use out of those.,57,,
418,0.97,3134.364,3137.534,And then there was a gap in the communication.,57,,
419,0.97,3137.534,3142.772,Like the conversation just sort of stopped.,57,,
420,0.97,3142.772,3148.178,"Then after repeatedly asking where are we at with this because this conversation started a couple of months ago, right?",57,,
421,0.97,3148.178,3157.42,And to my way of thinking we have managed to build a field hospital in Centurylink field and we haven't been able to deploy some Porta-Potties.,57,,
422,0.97,3157.42,3158.922,I don't understand what the whole hold up is.,57,,
423,0.97,3158.922,3162.025,And we haven't been able to get any answers.,57,,
424,0.97,3162.025,3190.887,"The reason that I am here today is because in those meetings I have asked who do we need to talk to, to try to express, you know, our concern and impress upon them that the need for this to be like now, not a month from now, not in three months, but like these are daily biological needs that every human being has right now.",57,,
425,0.97,3190.887,3193.523,I was pretty much stone walled with that.,57,,
426,0.97,3193.523,3196.293,I was told there was no one that I could speak to.,57,,
427,0.97,3196.293,3201.331,At that . I reached out to my director who forwarded that information to Allison.,57,,
428,0.97,3201.331,3212.142,"And we continue to ask these questions, but again we just continue to be told, you know, I asked this morning, where are we at with deploying Porta- Poties.",57,,
429,0.97,3212.142,3223.92,"And no, we just don't, like there's nothing, and the people that are in the room for the conversations, they say they are not in the room for those conversations.",57,,
430,0.97,3223.92,3232.662,"I think there's just, I don't understand how it could seem conceivable to not Prioritize something like this.",57,,
431,0.97,3232.662,3241.071,There is already a desperate need for these types of services or these sorts of things to be available to people.,57,,
432,0.97,3241.071,3261.558,"But now with things like McDonald's and Starbucks, and even a bare minimum that people were able to use.",57,,
433,0.97,3261.758,3270.367,"I have a gentleman who has a quarter of his skull missing from an accident where he was electrocuted and had one brain surgery, he's waiting for a second brain surgery.",57,,
434,0.97,3270.367,3279.576,I just went to make sure he got on the bus for his Neurosurgeon's appointment this morning.,57,,
435,0.97,3279.576,3286.282,"And he has caked dirt on his head, where his Sutures are from this brain surgery.",57,,
436,0.97,3286.282,3293.223,"And when I say caked, I could cut it off with a butter knife off of his head.",57,,
437,0.97,3293.223,3308.738,And that is how desperate the need is and these are human beings for whatever reason the city in my opinion not making it a priority.,57,,
438,0.97,3308.738,3315.245,I know that there are shortages of things like Porta-Potties and I realize they have to be cleaned.,57,,
439,0.97,3315.245,3326.756,"But we can hold Porta-Potties from places like the Fairgrounds and put those out and deal with getting them cleaned two weeks from now, you know, that would give us two weeks to figure it out.",57,,
440,0.97,3326.756,3333.997,"But in the meantime there are at least Accessing, having this accessible to them.",57,,
441,0.97,3333.997,3339.469,We have a shortage of hand Sanitizers as outreach workers.,57,,
442,0.97,3339.469,3346.943,"To be able to offer this to our clients in lieu of things, so we're not giving them any means to protect themselves in any way at all.",57,,
443,0.97,3346.943,3349.546,"Dawn, thank you so much for that.",58,,
444,0.97,3349.546,3352.549,Before I move on we do have a couple of more questions.,58,,
445,0.97,3352.549,3362.792,"I ask if people try to keep their responses concise, so we can get through as many of the questions as possible before we move on to the next panel.",58,,
446,0.97,3362.792,3373.303,Does anyone else want to jump in on Council member Morales' question from the panel before I move on to Council member Herbold?,58,,
447,0.97,3373.303,3374.003,"Okay, great.",58,,
448,0.97,3374.003,3381.444,"Yes, I would just say I appreciate the question.",59,,
449,0.97,3381.444,3399.529,"I cannot do more than dawn just did to express the profound frustration at the desire to partner, to solve these issues.",59,,
450,0.97,3399.529,3402.499,The lack of ability to move the process forward.,59,,
451,0.97,3402.499,3421.684,"Among the things that I have asked for is a point of contact at Seattle public utilities who could be the person to interact with and problem solve around the placement of the Porta Potties, which were belatedly deployed.",59,,
452,0.97,3421.684,3424.154,"My understanding, I mean, I have the list.",59,,
453,0.97,3424.154,3425.588,I have shared the list.,59,,
454,0.97,3425.588,3437.734,"There are multiple sites that are recommended, but again I want to go back to there aren't enough stand alone units.",59,,
455,0.97,3437.734,3439.736,We have to open them immediately.,59,,
456,0.97,3439.736,3443.54,And they are easier to clean than Porta-Potties are.,59,,
457,0.97,3443.54,3447.277,"Allison, thank you for those last remarks.",60,,
458,0.97,3447.277,3457.387,"I want to move on to Council member Herbold who has a question, then Council member Mosqueda will close it out with a question and we'll move on to the next panel.",60,,
459,0.97,3457.387,3459.889,Council member Herbold?,60,,
460,0.97,3459.889,3462.292,Thank you.,61,,
461,0.97,3462.292,3468.031,I want to share my great frustration with the conditions on the street.,61,,
462,0.97,3468.031,3501.965,"On one hand some are saying that our local response so the Covid 19 crisis is showing results and is considered to be a good response producing results, our failure to address the greatest needs of those, really should indict us all for really putting our entire city at risk.",61,,
463,0.97,3501.965,3508.605,The fact that thousands of people are completely unable to follow O the CDC guidance.,61,,
464,0.97,3508.605,3511.407,And what is our responsibility as a city?,61,,
465,0.97,3511.407,3522.452,"When it not only puts those people at risk, but our entire city at risk.",61,,
466,0.97,3522.452,3529.926,"And in 2018, 2018 the city auditor reported on Seattle's lack of public toilets.",61,,
467,0.97,3529.926,3540.036,And that is before so many of our public Votings were closed and before so many businesses.,61,,
468,0.97,3540.036,3553.449,"And by all means they don't all, but there are businesses in our city that do.",61,,
469,0.97,3553.449,3563.459,But in 2018 the city auditor said that we needed 224 toilets to meet basic needs.,61,,
470,0.97,3563.459,3571.901,"As mentioned earlier, Los Angeles has deployed 360 hygiene stations.",61,,
471,0.97,3571.901,3577.206,San Diego nearly 100.,61,,
472,0.97,3577.206,3591.12,"Berkeley home to 318 unsheltered people has placed more than double what we have here in Seattle with 5,200 people living unsheltered.",61,,
473,0.97,3591.12,3606.369,"You know, we funded a bit stop in the budget in November, trying to implement the recommendations of the 2018 audit because of the executive had not done it.",61,,
474,0.97,3606.369,3612.642,We put that money in the budget at a stake holder meeting held in late February.,61,,
475,0.97,3612.642,3616.145,And attended by the multiple departments.,61,,
476,0.97,3616.145,3621.15,They were still sharing basic information about what a mobile pit stop was and we were not ready to act.,61,,
477,0.97,3621.15,3632.862,But the mobile pit stop is an intervention that was identified again in the 2018 audit.,61,,
478,0.97,3632.862,3642.538,"And in late February this year, city staff still did not foe about that particular intervention.",61,,
479,0.97,3642.538,3647.777,And I really appreciate the work that people are doing.,61,,
480,0.97,3647.777,3668.231,I cannot imagine how frustrating and demoralizing and Traumatizing it is to have as a job the responsibility to deliver services and health and not have those services and help readily available.,61,,
481,0.97,3668.231,3691.854,"I'm going to do everything that I can to help implement the recommendations to open up more public buildings, staff those public buildings, and to implement more Porta-Potties and the shower trailers that we were told is coming.",61,,
482,0.97,3691.854,3704.467,In the interim I have a question about outreach and how we can do a better job of letting people know what is available now.,61,,
483,0.97,3704.467,3711.841,The city has as I believe of yesterday shared a list of O publicly available hygiene Facilites.,61,,
484,0.97,3711.841,3735.031,"They went through an old list that they had been providing that would have a lot of inaccurate information and had locations that were not open and locations that I visited and confirmed were not open, so they have updated that list, to the locations and that are actually open and available.",61,,
485,0.97,3735.031,3739.569,They're saying they're going to put together an interactive map.,61,,
486,0.97,3739.569,3747.777,I just want you to know is that a useful way for you to help people living unsheltered places?,61,,
487,0.97,3747.777,3761.19,"And is there another approach that we should be considering as well to let folks know while we're working to stand up what we currently do have, thank you.",61,,
488,0.97,3761.19,3763.659,Who wants to respond fairly and efficiently to that?,62,,
489,0.97,3763.659,3771.801,We have to move on to the next panel.,62,,
490,0.97,3771.801,3773.503,Who wants to take her question from the panel?,62,,
491,0.97,3773.503,3775.438,I could take that one.,63,,
492,0.97,3775.438,3776.506,"Quickly, please.",64,,
493,0.97,3776.506,3778.441,That would be cool.,65,,
494,0.97,3778.441,3784.28,"That is helpful, of course, all the information we could get is extremely helpful in having that interactive map.",65,,
495,0.97,3784.28,3791.02,"The problem that we are at as you are seeing so far, it is not exactly accurate.",65,,
496,0.97,3791.02,3795.658,And another thing that will contribute to getting that Messaging out is having people message that out.,65,,
497,0.97,3795.658,3805.802,"In general our outreach teams, they have diminished substantially due to either having folks that are in their own At-Risk category for Covid or a number of other reasons.",65,,
498,0.97,3805.802,3814.777,"And so having more people out and about informing, making sure that it is accurate and making sure there are postings would be helpful.",65,,
499,0.97,3814.777,3815.711,And increasing the number.,65,,
500,0.97,3815.711,3821.117,"At the end of the day increasing the number, increasing the number, increasing the number.",65,,
501,0.97,3821.117,3834.363,"It is devastating to hear those Stats for, you know, California and other places and to know our issue is so prominent and yet we have such a low number.",65,,
502,0.97,3834.363,3836.732,I'm sorry real quick.,66,,
503,0.97,3836.732,3838.935,Thank you.,67,,
504,0.97,3838.935,3841.871,"And the navigation team meetings, they are on Wednesdays at 8:00 A.M.",67,,
505,0.97,3841.871,3847.743,And a lot of providers go there because we want information of what's going on with the navigation team.,67,,
506,0.97,3847.743,3856.285,Where they will be held and the policy that will be changing and anything like that will secretly affect the work that we could do with our clients and where we could find our clients.,67,,
507,0.97,3856.285,3861.891,And so we were able to have more information from that meeting and more transparency.,67,,
508,0.97,3861.891,3879.208,"And when the people, the people who are leading the meeting are answering I don't know and then they would talk about that and we don't have that information and all of the providers are extremely Fustrated and it will affect our work and what we could do with our clients and their well being.",67,,
509,0.97,3879.208,3881.911,That will be super helpful in moving forward.,67,,
510,0.97,3881.911,3913.743,"And one last point, one thing that is not in lined with what we do, we want to make sure they are trauma informed and in saying that something is coming and that it never comes is not trauma informed and so we want to make sure that information that is getting out will be accurate because it is not fun right or, you know, it is not justice for us to go out there and say it is coming and it will be there and yet it is never there, so that will be a key component to them for folks who rarely have a lot of hope, okay?",68,,
511,0.97,3913.743,3919.315,And in fact that they will undermine the effectiveness of the public health Messaging overall.,69,,
512,0.97,3919.315,3921.817,And there are a whole bunch of other things to say about that.,69,,
513,0.97,3921.951,3926.756,"All right, well thank you, everybody, for coming in and participating.",70,,
514,0.97,3926.756,3943.773,One other thing that I do want to say going to Council member Herbold's statement and a shout out to our staff and for the great memo and the summary of hygiene stations that have been confirmed and open and that they distributed to the Council.,70,,
515,0.97,3943.773,3958.087,"This morning, my office created an interactive list of those and that they have all the hygiene stations as well as the hours that those stations are open and that could be accessed on my Website if you go to my Council Website.",70,,
516,0.97,3958.087,3962.558,There is a hygiene facility map that is now in the navigation tab.,70,,
517,0.97,3962.558,3971.901,And so I just wanted to flag that resource and in response to Council member Herbold's question.,70,,
518,0.97,3971.901,3975.905,"So with that panel, thank you so much.",70,,
519,0.97,3975.905,3989.185,"Thank you to Allison Brittany, Colleen, dawn, Jessica, stay in touch and thank you for your service out there in the field, we appreciate it.",70,,
520,0.97,3989.185,4002.932,"All right, so now we're going to move on to the next panel and similar to the last one if everyone can hold their questions until the end of the presentation.",70,,
521,0.97,4002.932,4017.546,I'm going to hand it over to get an update on the city's efforts and I would ask that folks continue to text me to get on the list and that system has been working well.,70,,
522,0.97,4017.546,4022.418,And we will go through it once deputy Mayor is done with his presentation.,70,,
523,0.97,4022.418,4026.856,Take it away.,70,,
524,0.97,4029.892,4044.874,"I'm suppose to be in my next set of meetings at 11:15, so I'm going to try my best to get through some of my presentation and bet to a few questions before I need to move on to my next meeting.",71,,
525,0.97,4044.874,4055.785,"First I think as you heard from director Hayes earlier today, you know, our large part of our Covid-19 response is assisting those in need.",71,,
526,0.97,4055.785,4063.426,And the entire structure of the city's response of our emergency operations plan is based on just four categories.,71,,
527,0.97,4063.426,4066.729,"Operations, public safety, community needs, and human services, and homelessness.",71,,
528,0.97,4066.729,4074.403,I would add that I'm personally overseeing the human services and homelessness work as part of our Covid-19 response.,71,,
529,0.97,4074.403,4095.891,I want to also take an opportunity to publicly thank all of our city employees who are literally on the front lines as we speak doing everything they can to provide for those living unsheltered.,71,,
530,0.97,4095.891,4107.303,"Those who have continued to work seven days a week and 24- hour shifts, 24-hour cycles, to make sure we are responding to those who are in need.",71,,
531,0.97,4107.303,4114.543,"They are putting their own lives at risk to help others, just as many others are that we have heard from the previous panel.",71,,
532,0.97,4114.543,4121.35,I want to thank our city employees for their ongoing work.,71,,
533,0.97,4121.35,4124.053,And for continuing to put the needs of others above theirs.,71,,
534,0.97,4124.053,4127.089,I know had is a very important issue for the council as well.,71,,
535,0.97,4127.089,4131.56,I want to thank you for your partnership and your resolution in March.,71,,
536,0.97,4131.56,4137.933,Affirming the state of emergency request that the city will make Investmnts on the hand washing services and that is just what we're doing.,71,,
537,0.97,4137.933,4141.871,So Maybe I could give you a quick overview of that.,71,,
538,0.97,4141.871,4147.076,"First of all, you know, our approach has several components to it.",71,,
539,0.97,4147.076,4148.511,One is getting people inside.,71,,
540,0.97,4148.511,4151.547,And so hygiene could be assessed there.,71,,
541,0.97,4151.547,4164.593,"I think that all of you know we recently announced our partnership with the county creating 1,900 new spaces being set up and many in Seattle to get people inside.",71,,
542,0.97,4164.593,4177.806,We are working very closely with the county and Dshs in Paticular to have a coordinated approach and strategy.,71,,
543,0.97,4177.806,4194.223,"One of our things is the effort, which began in the beginning of March when we would activate the hall and they are operate operating in partnership with the 24/7 basis in serving over 150 individuals.",71,,
544,0.97,4194.223,4205.534,And this is key to help them begin social distancing within their shelter network.,71,,
545,0.97,4205.534,4208.704,And we have serviced 24/7 shelters.,71,,
546,0.97,4208.704,4217.646,"Today they are staffed by parks and the staff in partnership with the community services, YMCA and wheel.",71,,
547,0.97,4217.646,4223.852,Garfield currently serves 50 women and Miller is serving 50 men in partnership with the housing.,71,,
548,0.97,4223.852,4231.86,And in addition as I think you are all aware we expedited delivery.,71,,
549,0.97,4231.86,4234.496,Of the new shelter spaces.,71,,
550,0.97,4234.496,4238.133,At Cherry Hill and Lake Union.,71,,
551,0.97,4238.267,4272.835,"Just to jump in for one secede, I'm sorry to interrupt your presentation because we are short of time, you know, I think just to maybe zero in and focus on the hygiene investments rather than the shelter intensification work, which the community is also following, but just to make sure we get to the hygiene comments and if there is some time left over to enact the update on the intensification.",72,,
552,0.97,4272.835,4286.582,"I do appreciate the city's efforts and I have walked by what's going on at the Seattle center spaces that are being used to do that, but just to make sure we address the hygiene issue.",72,,
553,0.97,4286.582,4292.588,"I just wanted to flag that and Prioritize that, so we could maybe deal with that issue first.",72,,
554,0.97,4292.588,4294.623,I'm happy to make that Pivot now.,73,,
555,0.97,4294.623,4295.691,I was planning on it.,73,,
556,0.97,4295.691,4301.33,But I do think it is important to make sure this is a multi- Prong effort that it is not just focused on hygiene.,73,,
557,0.97,4301.33,4312.875,"And the last thing I would mention, we are currently working, and my next meeting is working with the Army to site a shelter tent here in the city for 180 individuals.",73,,
558,0.97,4312.875,4323.852,We have a lot of things that are going on here and for people to come inside as many of the previous panel Mentiond is a critical component of our work.,73,,
559,0.97,4323.852,4328.924,Moving on to hygiene access for those people who are still on site though as you requested.,73,,
560,0.97,4328.924,4337.366,"I want to emphasize that, you know, as of today, we have at least 127 parks Restrooms that are open.",73,,
561,0.97,4337.366,4341.97,"I want to, you know, acknowledge that there has been some confusion about that number.",73,,
562,0.97,4341.97,4343.639,As it is fluctuating.,73,,
563,0.97,4343.639,4350.079,A part of it has been you have a number of parks bathrooms that typically are not open during the winter.,73,,
564,0.97,4350.079,4354.483,So we have been working to ensuring those are open.,73,,
565,0.97,4354.483,4363.892,The second thing is this number will continue to fluctuate based on our staffing and based on our ability to maintain each of these facilities.,73,,
566,0.97,4363.892,4377.506,"But rest assured we are doing everything we can in our parks maintenance crew, they are working incredibly hard to maintain each of these facilities.",73,,
567,0.97,4377.506,4382.044,"Of those 127 parks Restrooms, you know, we have 26 community centers.",73,,
568,0.97,4382.044,4385.681,11 of them have Restroom access that remains open.,73,,
569,0.97,4385.681,4389.184,And where we have not had access we are looking at augmenting that as well.,73,,
570,0.97,4389.184,4393.722,So we are doing our part to keep those Restrooms open.,73,,
571,0.97,4393.722,4403.365,"In addition we have kept our showers programs going, which continues to operate at Delridge, green Lake, meadow Brook, community center.",73,,
572,0.97,4403.365,4412.207,"We have been providing as our teams do Outreaches, making sure folks understand where those shower programs can remain.",73,,
573,0.97,4412.207,4417.613,And to make sure that folks have access to them.,73,,
574,0.97,4417.613,4433.662,"On the Spu side, we've talked about the previous panel, mentioned we have two weeks ago now announced six new locations for Porta Potties.",73,,
575,0.97,4433.662,4443.071,One of the original locations is now moved to 12th and Weller near the navigation center.,73,,
576,0.97,4443.071,4446.408,That was to decrease redundancy.,73,,
577,0.97,4446.408,4452.448,And just earlier this week the Mayor gave us a direction to add eight more sites.,73,,
578,0.97,4452.448,4457.152,And we will be finalizing those locations tomorrow.,73,,
579,0.97,4457.152,4473.202,"I would say those sites, locations, I think Jessica mentioned from reach have been developed in partnership with not just reach and other Stakeholders.",73,,
580,0.97,4473.202,4475.137,This is important . Riteria.,73,,
581,0.97,4475.137,4476.905,Number one is highest need.,73,,
582,0.97,4476.905,4485.881,"And so that is informed by the NAV team, parks, encampment teams to come to neighborhoods and other outreach teams including health care for the homeless.",73,,
583,0.97,4485.881,4490.819,Two no other access to toilets or SINKS.,73,,
584,0.97,4490.819,4492.588,"Three, adjacent to city property.",73,,
585,0.97,4492.588,4497.426,And four will not pose issues for either the facility use or private property.,73,,
586,0.97,4497.426,4505.801,And make sure the vendors will have the ability to maintain the cleaning protocols that public health has given us.,73,,
587,0.97,4505.801,4513.742,"And so those eight new locations, eight Spu is coordinating that work with the vendor.",73,,
588,0.97,4513.742,4516.178,As I said we are learning as we go here.,73,,
589,0.97,4516.178,4522.417,"The six sites have proved to be both successful in the sense that individuals, they are using them.",73,,
590,0.97,4522.417,4525.687,And that site at City Hall park has been used.,73,,
591,0.97,4525.687,4529.958,We actually added additional toilets last weekend.,73,,
592,0.97,4529.958,4535.864,And it does not come without challenges.,73,,
593,0.97,4535.864,4550.679,Our ability to maintain Cleanliness and theft related to hand Sanitizer.,73,,
594,0.97,4550.679,4555.884,Where she recognized that they continue to be an issue that individuals are experiencing.,73,,
595,0.97,4555.884,4557.786,We are working through that.,73,,
596,0.97,4557.786,4572.601,"And one of the things that I do want to add, this is not a limiting factor for us right now, but each of these sites, they are current projections, costing $35,000 a man to operate.",73,,
597,0.97,4572.601,4581.31,And that will take into account the cleaning and all of the other supplies that are necessary to maintain these sites.,73,,
598,0.97,4581.31,4592.587,"And once we stand up, we will be burning through half a million dollars in months in operating costs and that does not include staffing.",73,,
599,0.97,4592.587,4595.557,"As many members mentioned, these are not sites.",73,,
600,0.97,4595.557,4618.847,"If we do move into a staffing model that will require more on site supervision, that the cost of that will go up dramatically as does the ability for us to show you that program and we are working through it and, you know, obviously acknowledge that more work needs to be done.",73,,
601,0.97,4618.847,4624.953,And it was mentioned earlier that we have represented two shower facilities.,73,,
602,0.97,4624.953,4630.425,One of those facilities or trailers will go towards the Seattle center.,73,,
603,0.97,4630.425,4640.168,We are coordinating with both Seattle center staff to have that on the ground here over the next few days.,73,,
604,0.97,4640.168,4645.64,And that is to support the shelter and the shelter that is at the pavilion right now.,73,,
605,0.97,4645.64,4664.192,"The second as Colleen mentioned earlier, we will be going to Occidental park in partnership with the chief Seattle Club and I really want to thank Colleen for jumping at the opportunity to partner with us there and for staffing that showering trailer.",73,,
606,0.97,4664.192,4687.716,"I would mention that at Occidental park we have been working closely with the mid and Spu to ensure that the park is ready to receive the trailers and also to support the meals program, which is moved outdoors providing meals consistent with social Distancig.",73,,
607,0.97,4687.716,4695.724,"And on the clean city program, Su is considering those efforts.",73,,
608,0.97,4695.724,4717.446,And obviously our community is to double that by the end of April and to increased known to be leaking and the contact primarily in Ballard and to arrange the waste water disposal.,73,,
609,0.97,4717.446,4718.947,Our encampment trash program is continuing.,73,,
610,0.97,4718.947,4728.29,We have identified two additional encampment trash locations at Colorado Avenue South and eighth Avenue and South Othello.,73,,
611,0.97,4728.29,4733.929,Collectioning trash from 16 homeless Encampments.,73,,
612,0.97,4733.929,4751.88,"And Spu is distributing to the Encampments, and they distributed 628 bags, collecting 5,265 pounds of trash and since January, Spu, they are distributing 71,269 beds and collected over a million pounds of trash.",73,,
613,0.97,4751.88,4758.787,"Spu is also providing weekly bags, litter pick up at 14 sites around the city.",73,,
614,0.97,4758.787,4773.602,"In particular SpA has arranged the collection, all of our Porta-Potty sites and in addition in March, Spu collected more than 14,000 Syringes from city public rights away and located around the city.",73,,
615,0.97,4773.602,4784.679,"And since that program began of August of 2016, that's over 327 sharks that have been collected.",73,,
616,0.97,4784.679,4791.787,Lastly the city funds 11 different day centers and the urban rest stops including showers.,73,,
617,0.97,4791.787,4806.935,"Those have remained open throughout this period and it is a $6 million investment that the city makes, distributing hygiene kits to date and close to 1,500 hygiene kits.",73,,
618,0.97,4806.935,4816.111,Kits are being handed out by the system navigators and the officers as they would engage as part of the outreach efforts.,73,,
619,0.97,4816.111,4825.754,"Those kits will contain the hygiene supplies, informational parks and public health as well as the map of the hygiene fire stations that are made available.",73,,
620,0.97,4825.754,4830.759,We also are working with the the supplies that they Nee.,73,,
621,0.97,4830.759,4845.473,"Both the city and the county, they have been engaged with the shelter operations, other providers to supply their needs for the procurement that we have been working through the past few weeks.",73,,
622,0.97,4845.473,4851.88,"As you can imagine, we're not the only municipality looking to fill the supply needs, but we're doing as best as we can.",73,,
623,0.97,4851.88,4862.19,"We are working through that in working with the others, to try to augment those efforts.",73,,
624,0.97,4862.19,4873.969,"And before I move on to Ballard Commons, which is one of the other topics of this council meeting, member Lewis, I would just like to comment.",73,,
625,0.97,4873.969,4889.551,"And also that they commented earlier about the National Guard and I would just say that, you know, the Mayor herself has been engaged with both the governor and the head of the National Guard for well over a month for asking for support and resources, not just in sheltering, but the other services.",73,,
626,0.97,4889.551,4893.321,"And those conversations, they were ongoing.",73,,
627,0.97,4893.321,4906.902,"But the National Guard, they have yet to take on those requests, but I did want to ensure everyone, we are doing everything we can to request additional assistance from both the Feds and the state and the National Guard to assist us.",73,,
628,0.97,4906.902,4917.512,"The other thing I really want to emphasize that was said from the previous panel that all of our shelters, operators, other partners in this work are stretched very thin.",73,,
629,0.97,4917.512,4922.717,And you know that is an operational constraint that we cannot ignore.,73,,
630,0.97,4922.717,4924.352,We are doing our best to do that.,73,,
631,0.97,4924.352,4946.675,"We have stood up this week and a new Reassignment Hub here and that Hub to meet those needs and that I want to be very clear, Normallythese efforts, we do in partnership with the community partners who are not able to support us right now because they are engaged, they are stretched thin as we are.",73,,
632,0.97,4946.675,4953.181,And so that is an operational challenge for us that we are trying to work through.,73,,
633,0.97,4953.181,4970.699,"The last thing I mentioned just on general access is, you know, while a number of sort of places that individuals could normally use Restrooms that are not city facilities.",73,,
634,0.97,4970.699,4974.602,Of course we fully acknowledge that there is a great need and we are working to fill it.,73,,
635,0.97,4974.602,4979.274,There are a number of essential businesses that are allowed to stay open across the city.,73,,
636,0.97,4979.274,4985.513,I would encourage the Council members and your individual districts if you could work with those essential businesses.,73,,
637,0.97,4985.513,4988.95,And to help ensure that there are bathrooms and they are made available.,73,,
638,0.97,4988.95,4994.422,And for us to be able to provide I think Brittany mentioned it.,73,,
639,0.97,4994.422,5000.662,To provide that information to our outreach team and both the cities and the other outreach teams.,73,,
640,0.97,5000.662,5003.531,That would be incredibly helpful.,73,,
641,0.97,5003.531,5006.868,"And with that Council member, we will move on to comments if that is okay.",73,,
642,0.97,5006.868,5015.276,"Yes, thank you, deputy Mayor.",74,,
643,0.97,5015.276,5019.147,That is what the director has influenced.,75,,
644,0.97,5019.147,5022.751,And both with the Covid-19 response and the library is being closed.,75,,
645,0.97,5022.751,5031.126,"And a number of individuals, they are living unsheltered.",75,,
646,0.97,5031.126,5038.099,And they have spent quite a bit of time and trying to get more coordinated in our work there.,75,,
647,0.97,5038.099,5041.97,I want to thank the council member for bringing folks together last week.,75,,
648,0.97,5041.97,5046.941,As well.,75,,
649,0.97,5046.941,5049.878,We will take a few questions.,75,,
650,0.97,5049.878,5053.481,And that they were out there on Monday.,75,,
651,0.97,5053.481,5062.524,"There was still one that was present and the others have dispersed, but they did refuse the pumped out services.",75,,
652,0.97,5062.524,5063.491,And they remain open.,75,,
653,0.97,5063.491,5074.069,"And we have parks that have brought in a couple of additional Porta Potties while the lieu was closed, but we decided to leave those Porta Potties there.",75,,
654,0.97,5074.069,5080.208,In addition to the Portland lieu we have adjusted our cleaning protocols based on guidance from public health.,75,,
655,0.97,5080.208,5090.118,"And the team has been out there for several days this week and engaging with the individuals who are living unsheltered, trying to get an assessment of their needs.",75,,
656,0.97,5090.118,5098.827,And the interest on coming indoors.,75,,
657,0.97,5098.827,5102.564,Offering the voluntary vaccination services.,75,,
658,0.97,5102.564,5115.61,So we are as the family being more coordinated many their efforts there and they will continue to work through that in partnership with the council member Strauss.,75,,
659,0.97,5115.61,5122.55,"Thank you so much, deputy Mayor, there are several questions.",76,,
660,0.97,5122.55,5125.086,I hope we can get through as many of these as possible.,76,,
661,0.97,5125.086,5135.53,I want to recognize first Council member Morales who has two questions.,76,,
662,0.97,5135.53,5136.131,"And Council member Mosqueda,",76,,
663,0.97,5136.131,5138.633,Thank you.,77,,
664,0.97,5138.633,5140.869,I want to ask a couple of questions.,77,,
665,0.97,5140.869,5159.888,The first is how is it possibly that we are seeing a spike in hepatitis a in the Ballard area and considering that Hsd and Spu and they are suppose to have shifted towards outreach and clean up geared towards more of a healthy living environment and that is one question.,77,,
666,0.97,5159.888,5173.968,"And then the other question is reporting recently about King County, how they started purchasing mobile showers, Restrooms, facilities, and end of February.",77,,
667,0.97,5173.968,5186.614,I would like to know why we have not done that yet and when we'll be purchasing the mobile pit stop that Council offered in November.,77,,
668,0.97,5186.614,5208.336,"And in my area of expertise that I'm not going to attempt to be an expert on that and they would suggest that across the city, not just in Ballard and across the city that we currently have more the end of March, that we did in all of 2019.",78,,
669,0.97,5208.336,5221.716,And that I do not know if it is entirely related to our Covid- 19 situation right now.,78,,
670,0.97,5221.716,5259.721,To ensure we are maintaining all of our facilities to stop the spread of cap A. and certainly making sure there is access or continuing factors to make sure there are greater access to collections.,78,,
671,0.97,5280.074,5306.901,"This is a little different model that they have been engaged with us on, but we are in a part of San Francisco and Oakland and learning from them about what and how they are operating the facilities in our Covid-19 state and are trying to mirror their work with the guidance we are getting from the state and public health.",78,,
672,0.97,5306.901,5311.305,And you mentioned that you are renting the facilities.,79,,
673,0.97,5311.305,5315.777,When will we be purchasing the ones that Council authorized?,79,,
674,0.97,5315.777,5319.547,Everyone across the country is trying to purchase Porta Potties and other things.,80,,
675,0.97,5319.547,5328.823,"We are the best that we could do right now, get our hands on two treatments.",80,,
676,0.97,5328.823,5331.359,"All right, thank you Council member Mosqueda.",81,,
677,0.97,5331.359,5332.76,Your question?,81,,
678,0.97,5332.76,5336.164,"Thank you, chair Lewis.",82,,
679,0.97,5336.164,5338.833,Building off of Council member Morales' point.,82,,
680,0.97,5338.833,5341.169,We allocated $1.3 million in the 2020 budget.,82,,
681,0.97,5341.169,5346.074,This is something that I and Council member Bagshaw supported.,82,,
682,0.97,5346.074,5347.141,This is prior to Covid.,82,,
683,0.97,5347.141,5365.493,"The question is what are we doing to redeploy the $1.3 million to get hand washing facilities and Porta Potties in light of the fact that there are concerts that are not happening, Fairgrounds that are not being used, retailers who usually rent these out, what are we doing to deploy these now?",82,,
684,0.97,5365.493,5379.006,"And the second part of my question is if I had come into this presentation and I respect that you are being pulled in a million different directions, but I would have frankly said I have a presentation that I'm happy to E-mail you later, I want to respond directly to the questions that were asked earlier.",82,,
685,0.97,5379.006,5387.682,"And the three questions being, can we open up our public facilities and have these hand washing and shower Facilites open to those who need it.",82,,
686,0.97,5387.682,5391.219,And how are we working to staff those up with trauma informed people?,82,,
687,0.97,5391.219,5401.129,"How are we also working to make sure that the beds that were promised, the 1,900 beds, which I have E-Mailed about are actually being deployed and open?",82,,
688,0.97,5401.129,5418.813,"And as you saw in my E-mail and as was just heard from the panel before, saying something coming Online and then not actually having that exact number be new beds is just as dangerous as making it just as dangerous as not even having the beds that are made available.",82,,
689,0.97,5418.813,5420.114,People might not trust us.,82,,
690,0.97,5420.114,5435.029,"On beds and hand washing facilities, I would love for you to directly respond to not just what has been purchased so far, and because we appreciate that, but what is going to be done in addition to those responses put out there right now.",82,,
691,0.97,5435.029,5449.377,Lastly I want to make sure before a call is put out to any private restaurant owners to open their bathrooms where people aren't suppose to go past the front desk at this point that we have talked to public health about that strategy.,82,,
692,0.97,5449.377,5457.785,My gut reaction that was not a sound public health strategy to ask restaurant owners to allow people to use their restaurants again.,82,,
693,0.97,5457.785,5462.59,It was a bad public health policy before Covid and I don't believe it's the right strategy now.,82,,
694,0.97,5462.59,5469.096,I think we need those hand washing facilities deployed and those public buildings open with trauma informed individuals to help people get in.,82,,
695,0.97,5469.096,5478.806,"And so please respond directly to the questions that were asked in the earlier panel, so we can move beyond what has already been purchased.",82,,
696,0.97,5479.04,5484.779,"Okay, I want to make sure that I have all the questions you just listed off.",83,,
697,0.97,5484.779,5490.651,"I'm sorry, my brain is not going that quickly anymore.",83,,
698,0.97,5490.651,5503.431,"One was the $1.3 million, third was the 1,900 beds and the fourth was public health guidance on essential businesses.",83,,
699,0.97,5503.431,5507.935,"On the $1.34 million, you know, I would say the color of money is not the thing that is driving us right now.",83,,
700,0.97,5507.935,5512.54,We are trying to get our hands on what we can get.,83,,
701,0.97,5512.54,5522.617,"And deploy them expeditiously both Porta Potties, hand washing stations, and as I mentioned the two mobile shower trailer units.",83,,
702,0.97,5522.617,5528.856,"One of our challenges is our ability to procure those things, but we also want to make sure we have a program in place that can maintain them.",83,,
703,0.97,5528.856,5533.027,We do not want our best intentions here to come flying back at us.,83,,
704,0.97,5533.027,5539.967,We are having challenges maintaining what we have already put out.,83,,
705,0.97,5539.967,5550.077,We are not recognizing the need or the opportunity for us to continue to expand that program.,83,,
706,0.97,5550.077,5552.48,But we are experiencing some challenges.,83,,
707,0.97,5552.48,5560.688,"As I mentioned, once we have those 14 sites set up, the current cost of those is half a million dollars a month to operate them.",83,,
708,0.97,5560.688,5570.398,"So with respect to the one point, I'm trying not to get into the color of the money situation because that does not buy us very much in our current environment when we are competing for everybody else.",83,,
709,0.97,5570.398,5572.633,For these high priority resources.,83,,
710,0.97,5572.633,5582.51,Good news is we are working with FEMA and we do have a public health order that is allowing us to try to get as much of this funded or reimbursed by FEMA.,83,,
711,0.97,5582.51,5586.614,So we're trying not to let our cost be the driver here.,83,,
712,0.97,5586.614,5589.317,Because it shouldn't in this great environment.,83,,
713,0.97,5589.317,5591.919,"But it is, that is just our situation.",83,,
714,0.97,5591.919,5593.754,So I'm trying.,83,,
715,0.97,5593.754,5602.43,"That may not be a satisfactory answer, but $1.34 million in our current environment is not going to get us very far.",83,,
716,0.97,5602.43,5609.637,"On the opening of public facilities, you know, closing public facilities is one of the hardest decisions the Mayor had to make.",83,,
717,0.97,5609.637,5614.475,"And you know, there are a number of reasons and factors that went into that decision.",83,,
718,0.97,5614.475,5620.348,We continue to assess whether or not that is something we should maintain.,83,,
719,0.97,5620.348,5636.263,"But I think for libraries in particular and, you know, the acknowledgment that their work force, a lot of them fit the bill for vulnerable, over 60, or have some type of underlying health condition.",83,,
720,0.97,5636.263,5648.676,"Their ability to maintain library facilities while maintaining social distancing and all the other things, and they are not trained for true Ma informed providing trauma informed services.",83,,
721,0.97,5648.676,5657.618,"So you know that is, again, an operational barrier for us that we are trying to problem solve.",83,,
722,0.97,5657.618,5665.793,"On the community center side, you know, we have 26, 11 of the 26 community centers, they will have their bathroom facilities already open.",83,,
723,0.97,5665.793,5674.668,"And as we continue to push out other portable solutions, you know, obviously we are looking at how we augment where they are closing one of the sites.",83,,
724,0.97,5674.668,5679.807,And the Lake city for exactly that reason.,83,,
725,0.97,5679.807,5686.347,"On the 1,900 beds, you know, I don't want to get into the Semantics of announcements.",83,,
726,0.97,5686.347,5690.418,"The reality is there are 1,900 new beds that are coming Online.",83,,
727,0.97,5690.418,5694.722,And so in partnership with the county we are doing that.,83,,
728,0.97,5694.722,5697.825,"Deputy Mayor, that is not correct.",84,,
729,0.97,5697.825,5700.694,Allison?,85,,
730,0.97,5700.694,5704.131,Only Council member members can interact with the Panelist.,86,,
731,0.97,5704.131,5707.234,"Sorry, I just wanted to throw that out there.",86,,
732,0.97,5707.234,5712.339,I'm sure that the council member will raise that question.,86,,
733,0.97,5712.339,5725.352,But I just wanted to say we are at the phase where Council members will interact with the panel and just appreciate your your acknowledgment of that.,86,,
734,0.97,5725.352,5733.561,Sorry.,86,,
735,0.97,5733.561,5740.367,"But I do Council member, I do acknowledge the word new.",87,,
736,0.97,5740.367,5742.77,I will note that.,87,,
737,0.97,5742.77,5747.775,I will make sure going forward we are more careful about that word.,87,,
738,0.97,5747.775,5754.882,That means that individuals were moved from existing beds to existing shelters.,88,,
739,0.97,5754.882,5761.856,"So I think the concern we're hearing and the concern I think we're having is that there weren't 1,900 new beds.",88,,
740,0.97,5761.856,5770.765,They were beds that have been filled by individuals who are in places like our Seattle hall that had to be Dedensitied.,88,,
741,0.97,5770.765,5774.468,And that is where the frustration is coming from when we hear the word new.,88,,
742,0.97,5774.468,5776.07,I appreciate you acknowledging that.,88,,
743,0.97,5776.07,5781.442,But I think we need to be honest with folks about how many new beds are coming Online and when those new facilities open.,88,,
744,0.97,5781.442,5787.014,I think a lot of us think great that has access to hygiene centers and that is the purpose of today's discussion.,88,,
745,0.97,5787.014,5794.421,And then we are having to kind of clarify these are not new beds that are problematic.,88,,
746,0.97,5794.421,5800.494,As an earlier panel member said translates into when we announce new hand washing facilities and we are not meeting the needs.,88,,
747,0.97,5800.494,5803.464,We are losing the public's trust.,88,,
748,0.97,5803.464,5805.366,"Got it, thank you.",89,,
749,0.97,5805.599,5808.602,"Council member Lewis, I probably have time for one or two more questions.",90,,
750,0.97,5808.602,5810.604,All right.,91,,
751,0.97,5810.604,5815.743,"So deputy Mayor, council member Herbold has a question and I will turn it over to her.",91,,
752,0.97,5815.743,5820.314,"I have a closing quick question for you, so Council member Herbold?",91,,
753,0.97,5820.314,5821.949,Council member Strauss has a question too.,91,,
754,0.97,5821.949,5822.583,Council member Herbold?,91,,
755,0.97,5822.583,5826.02,And I too have a part question.,92,,
756,0.97,5826.02,5836.397,"Back on March 27, there was a heads up.",92,,
757,0.97,5845.906,5848.742,And we visited regularly by Spu staff.,92,,
758,0.97,5848.742,5854.381,"And at the time I had asked for more detail about that schedule, and I'm still waiting on that.",92,,
759,0.97,5854.381,5855.683,Okay.,93,,
760,0.97,5855.683,5865.96,And also as it will relate to the maps that have been put out the most recent version of the maps have been put out.,94,,
761,0.97,5865.96,5871.899,And as it relates specifically.,94,,
762,0.97,5871.899,5888.716,"And one says it is open, well two of them say they are open 7:00 A.M.",94,,
763,0.97,5888.716,5892.519,To 7:00 or 9:00 P.M.,94,,
764,0.97,5892.519,5898.826,And then one of those two indicates that it is new.,94,,
765,0.97,5898.826,5904.098,I'm not sure what new means because it might be one of the existing bricks and mortar buildings that have been reopen.,94,,
766,0.97,5904.098,5907.201,There are two bricks and mortar buildings.,94,,
767,0.97,5907.201,5910.104,I have just recently visited.,94,,
768,0.97,5910.104,5912.439,Just in the last 48 hours.,94,,
769,0.97,5912.439,5917.411,And only one of those two bricks and mortar buildings are open.,94,,
770,0.97,5917.411,5920.848,And this map will indicate that it seems to indicate the map list.,94,,
771,0.97,5920.848,5923.217,It seems to indicate that two of them are open.,94,,
772,0.97,5923.217,5939.166,"Then in the section where they will need to talk about Spu comfort stations, and I'm presuming that those Spu comfort stations are the new Porta Potties and the hand washing stations because it seems to be the six that have been recently announced.",94,,
773,0.97,5939.166,5941.168,And it says open 24 hours.,94,,
774,0.97,5941.168,5947.875,When I was out there when those were first deployed and the sign says 7:00 to 8:00 P.M.,94,,
775,0.97,5947.875,5952.146,"And not 24 hours, so I want to flag that.",94,,
776,0.97,5952.146,5963.19,"I would like to know a little more detail on the cost that each one of these locations will cost $30,000 a month and it does not include any staffing cost.",94,,
777,0.97,5963.19,5969.496,I'm really interested to know whether or not we are experiencing price gouging in this time of great need.,94,,
778,0.97,5969.496,5984.778,And as it relates to specifically to be mobile pit stops.,94,,
779,0.97,6015.909,6019.246,And that is what they have talked at.,94,,
780,0.97,6019.246,6022.249,18 hand washing stations throughout the city.,94,,
781,0.97,6022.249,6027.521,I'm trying to figure out whether or not those are new locations.,94,,
782,0.97,6027.521,6038.932,"And that have already been installed, and where they are if that is the case or if this is an error and they are reporting something as having already happened that is yet to happen.",94,,
783,0.97,6038.932,6051.245,And then finally I want to flag the first Prototypes for the mobile PT stop that we would need to talk about called the lava May.,94,,
784,0.97,6051.245,6054.148,And I believe it was in Los Angeles.,94,,
785,0.97,6054.148,6061.021,"When they first started that prototype, they did not go to buy something that was already made.",94,,
786,0.97,6061.021,6067.461,They made it and they would work with their pipe Fitters and the Plum Arers unions to Retro fit the old buses.,94,,
787,0.97,6067.461,6086.146,"If we cannot buy stuff right now, just like we would work with the carpenter's Union to build the tiny houses, we need to make these things as soon as possible.",94,,
788,0.97,6105.899,6117.945,And suffice to say that it will be both and that you pointed out where it will not be something for those Consistencies and we will continue to refine that and to follow up with you and the rest of the Council on that.,94,,
789,0.97,6117.945,6121.648,We are certainly not trying to mislead anyone.,94,,
790,0.97,6121.648,6123.75,And really I want to be clear.,94,,
791,0.97,6123.75,6130.324,I want us to be as accurate and reflective of the evolving situation as we can.,94,,
792,0.97,6130.324,6139.733,And importantly to make sure our outreach team and both the cities and the others will have the information and they have that information that they need and when they are out engaging with the other individuals.,94,,
793,0.97,6139.733,6147.975,"The Porta-Potty and the hand washing stations, they're originally showing you the program.",94,,
794,0.97,6147.975,6152.246,To have set hours every day.,94,,
795,0.97,6152.246,6157.784,Very quickly into our programming that we found it was not possible for us to maintain that.,94,,
796,0.97,6157.784,6160.053,"And so those facilities, they are now 24/7.",94,,
797,0.97,6160.053,6175.102,There is a change in program based on the early experience that we were having.,94,,
798,0.97,6193.787,6197.024,It will be a simple supply and demand.,94,,
799,0.97,6197.024,6204.998,"And my hope is, I don't set the prices, so I'm not going to speak for other people.",94,,
800,0.97,6204.998,6210.938,But I--my hope is overtime these costs will come down.,94,,
801,0.97,6210.938,6226.153,"But with that said with all due respect, I think as we would begin, they could dig more into Úpre-Covid, the program and the model that you and others have been working on.",94,,
802,0.97,6226.153,6228.055,The estimates were low.,94,,
803,0.97,6228.055,6237.331,"And the costs, they were actually greater and I'm happy to chat Offline about that.",94,,
804,0.97,6237.331,6251.678,"But once Spu began to operate that, that plan and that cost operated quite true.",94,,
805,0.97,6264.658,6269.796,That it might be a reflection of taking that number.,94,,
806,0.97,6269.796,6275.202,But I want to get your real effort or not and not speculate.,94,,
807,0.97,6275.202,6275.636,Thank you.,95,,
808,0.97,6275.636,6284.611,"Thank you, deputy Mayor.",95,,
809,0.97,6284.611,6298.392,And Council member Gonzalez has a couple of closing remarks.,95,,
810,0.97,6298.792,6306.366,And that we could get you out of there soon and to appreciate you taking the time.,95,,
811,0.97,6306.366,6307.401,Council member Gonzalez?,95,,
812,0.97,6307.401,6309.67,"Thank you, chair Lewis.",96,,
813,0.97,6309.67,6319.946,"I want to just, first I want to acknowledge this is a very difficult space for us to all navigate and operate in.",96,,
814,0.97,6319.946,6351.511,And what you're hearing from many of my colleagues is what I hope is a shared frustration and being able to really operate and realize what I hope is a mutual goal and intent of standing up appropriate public health trauma informed strategies and tools to help with the hygiene needs of those folks who do not have that ability to shelter in place as many of us are currently enjoying.,96,,
815,0.97,6351.511,6359.986,"I want to, you know, first start off by acknowledging the efforts.",96,,
816,0.97,6359.986,6375.902,I want to recognize that we are still falling short on our absolute moral obligation and duty to meet the hygiene needs of those who are currently experiencing homelessness.,96,,
817,0.97,6375.902,6382.909,"And you know, I want to acknowledge that fact.",96,,
818,0.97,6382.909,6393.42,Our strategy in this space was unsatisfactory.,96,,
819,0.97,6393.42,6416.176,"So before the Covid pandemic hit our community, we would rely on the Graciousness for those people that are made available in our public libraries were accessible to those people experiencing homelessness.",96,,
820,0.97,6416.176,6425.152,That means that thousands of people have nowhere to shelter during the day or at nighttime.,96,,
821,0.97,6425.152,6430.423,And they do not have access to toilets and SINKS.,96,,
822,0.97,6430.423,6438.231,A significant amount of people.,96,,
823,0.97,6438.231,6445.705,And it is sort of going to peel in compare season to what that true scale of the need is.,96,,
824,0.97,6445.705,6464.958,"I really want us to have that conversation in reality that is based on the emergency response, those that are rooted in the public health concepts, Trily going to at least attempt to rise to that occasion to meet the scale of the need.",96,,
825,0.97,6464.958,6473.6,"When I hear that we have 14 Porta Potties somewhere or two toilets over here, I mean I appreciate that.",96,,
826,0.97,6473.6,6483.41,"But when we are talking about potentially 14 or two toilets, we are Upwaters of 6,000 people.",96,,
827,0.97,6483.41,6490.917,I feel like we are having a conversation based on the reality in terms of what the actual need is.,96,,
828,0.97,6490.917,6495.222,I want to be able to have that conversation and to be productive.,96,,
829,0.97,6495.222,6502.929,"This is an opportunity for us to not point fingers, but to come together.",96,,
830,0.97,6502.929,6504.631,And for this community.,96,,
831,0.97,6504.631,6522.716,"I also want to show that we are not showing you the outbreak that will bring us together here today, that's primarily about the lack of access to the toilets and the SINKS, in order to engage in hand washing.",96,,
832,0.97,6522.716,6543.336,"And yes other issues that could be sort of true to that and related to the Covid crisis, but I want to make sure we're staying focused on the current need of the population that is emerging, which is the outbreak on top of the risk exposure to the deadly Covid 19 virus.",96,,
833,0.97,6543.336,6550.477,"And so I want to make sure that we're staying focused on that and I guess what I want to hear from you, deputy Mayor.",96,,
834,0.97,6550.477,6580.807,"And how we are going to be able to effectively engage with the executive in identifying real solutions that are not going to be caught up in bureaucracy, to those who will need it the most and I want to encourage us to really think about the most creative ways that we could do that.",96,,
835,0.97,6580.807,6592.919,"To help us deliver on our obligations to meet the needs of folks, relying on us.",96,,
836,0.97,6592.919,6598.858,I appreciate your comments.,97,,
837,0.97,6598.858,6620.413,"I hope you can see the shared in frustrations, the needs are great and exacerbated, the fact that so many folks are experiencing homelessness and normally that we will turn to and even when they are open, it is not enough.",97,,
838,0.97,6620.413,6635.428,"It is also important for us to be in that agreement that we are never going to be able to end that moment and replace that capacity, that scale that there are too many challenges for us.",97,,
839,0.97,6635.428,6648.241,That does not mean we're not trying and we don't want to work in partnership with the council as we will go about trying to fill the need.,97,,
840,0.97,6648.241,6653.346,We are going to need help.,97,,
841,0.97,6653.346,6656.349,In order to advance this.,97,,
842,0.97,6656.349,6679.739,"Director Hayes and I have spoken about this several times about what and how we have a program that will work and that is, again, meeting their needs, also protecting them to get back to O, you know, just the decisions that we have to make around staffing, cleaning.",97,,
843,0.97,6679.739,6681.107,We are working through that.,97,,
844,0.97,6681.107,6691.518,And as best as we can.,97,,
845,0.97,6691.951,6704.431,All those that are listening in and we are open to having that creative conversation.,97,,
846,0.97,6704.431,6718.411,Earlier and he is in the Q. hat Council member Strauss?,97,,
847,0.97,6718.411,6726.119,"Chair Lewis, thank you for the opportunity to speak.",98,,
848,0.97,6726.119,6729.622,I look forward to following up the meetings.,98,,
849,0.97,6729.622,6739.733,Either card Nateing or requesting as you and your Department know.,98,,
850,0.97,6739.733,6744.404,In the hepatitis a cases for the last number of weeks.,98,,
851,0.97,6744.404,6753.379,I use this to call on the issue.,98,,
852,0.97,6753.379,6770.196,On a typical day just with the Starbucks and the library that will allow for 1 stalls each location and to have those available.,98,,
853,0.97,6770.196,6779.973,I want to signal my appreciation for you to bringing those hand washing stations to the park.,98,,
854,0.97,6779.973,6801.027,"That was not on the original list because we know it is a preventable disease and a virus that we need to have the appropriate hand washing stations, the appropriate things, also thanking you for the increased sanitation and for the increase outreach by the navigation team.",98,,
855,0.97,6801.027,6811.838,And also highlighting the fact that we will need to be opening up the bathroom facilities that will utilize soap and not hand Sanitizers.,98,,
856,0.97,6811.838,6825.351,And we need to--I've heard reports that people are drinking the water that is being provided for hand washing.,98,,
857,0.97,6825.351,6845.438,Much of this you have heard from me many times already.,98,,
858,0.97,6847.14,6850.176,And as well as your comments from the colleagues.,98,,
859,0.97,6850.176,6853.713,We could follow up Offline and with our colleagues as well.,98,,
860,0.97,6853.713,6861.387,A couple of things that I thought were raised in Upsing that I would like to possibly work with the executive on.,98,,
861,0.97,6861.387,6880.473,It was raised that we have a number of gyms that have been closed in the city Cue to the public health crisis.,98,,
862,0.97,6880.74,6887.68,There's a lot of folks that are many that Jim and so there has to be a lot of shower and the hygiene facilities.,98,,
863,0.97,6887.68,6895.288,That could be the potential area where Maybe there are some gyms in that city and they would be interested in contacting the services.,98,,
864,0.97,6895.288,6897.156,And it might be an interesting area to explore.,98,,
865,0.97,6897.156,6903.896,"Now the other thing I want to flag earlier, you know, we got an update from our reach folks.",98,,
866,0.97,6903.896,6929.756,"And about like a real moving story, where she had to provide a pair of her own pants to someone on her case load just because, you know, a lot of those resources that do provide health outreach, folks that are experiencing the homelessness and experiencing their own shutdown or the lack of the ability to get out there and provide those resources.",98,,
867,0.97,6929.756,6936.863,And I know that the resource center at the Seattle municipal court.,98,,
868,0.97,6936.863,6947.874,"They do have a store that are readily available for members of the public, that are in need of having new clothes provided.",98,,
869,0.97,6947.874,6959.886,And in a time with an issue that I had not really considered until this presentation is possibly on out there just having basic access.,98,,
870,0.97,6959.886,6971.698,That may be a steady resource that is underutilized during this crisis due to the municipal court that is being closed to give you another resource to the outreach workers.,98,,
871,0.97,6971.698,6993.119,I want to circle back the comments around those public buildings and like I said earlier on my Council Website that I have created a map of what has been available in that open station and some of which are public buildings that were provided to Jeff on central staff yesterday I believe that are open with the posted hours.,98,,
872,0.97,6993.119,7011.404,If there are ways to work together to expand that list with more public buildings that could be open and I think that is an your where we could work on figuring out the feasibility of opening up at least in a limited way more public buildings for hygiene facilities.,98,,
873,0.97,7011.404,7017.11,And those are just a few of the things that I wanted to flag and no need to answer now if you need to get off.,98,,
874,0.97,7017.11,7019.912,We could follow up Online on this.,98,,
875,0.97,7019.912,7024.751,"And deputy, I will give you the last word for when you need to leave.",98,,
876,0.97,7024.751,7028.221,Then we'll close out the committee meeting.,98,,
877,0.97,7028.221,7029.422,"Thank you, council member.",99,,
878,0.97,7029.422,7035.862,We are happy to follow up with you on that and any other questions that the Council has.,99,,
879,0.97,7035.862,7040.967,"And as Council member Strauss mentioned, I'm happy to speak individually with the Council members.",99,,
880,0.97,7040.967,7049.475,"You know, again, I think today was a very helpful and Insightful conversation, I'm Gad we were able to hear from Colleen and Allison and Jessica.",99,,
881,0.97,7049.475,7053.279,"And Brittany, dawn, and the first panel.",99,,
882,0.97,7053.279,7056.048,Truly happy director Hayes was able to join us as well.,99,,
883,0.97,7056.048,7073.366,"I guess in closing I would just like to say on sort of mapping out the existing facilities again, that's something we're working very closely on and that you have put something on your Website and we will see if there are ways for you to amplify that work as well.",99,,
884,0.97,7073.366,7084.01,"And you know, I just want to really emphasize though to remind folks that we are working to be responsive, but we are in an incredibly dynamic environment.",99,,
885,0.97,7084.01,7089.715,"And where the guidance, we will continue to evolve and the CDC would issue the new guidance last week.",99,,
886,0.97,7089.715,7095.888,"Public health, they continue to refine its guidance.",99,,
887,0.97,7095.888,7106.199,"And our staffing, challenges, not just here at this city, but across all of our providers and our Go-To folks and partners are experiencing the same staffing challenges that we will have as well.",99,,
888,0.97,7106.199,7116.042,"And as I said before, we have requested additional support from the Feds and the state and from the National Guard and that is yet to materialize.",99,,
889,0.97,7116.042,7125.651,"So you know, this is not about acknowledging the Neds or wanting to fulfill those needs and that it is a reality that we will have some checks and barriers and being able to do so.",99,,
890,0.97,7125.651,7142.768,But we are working through those and I want to ensure the Council that we're doing it in coordination with King County as well and especially within our shelter and unsheltered homeless population.,99,,
891,0.97,7142.768,7150.476,"And to make sure that we have coordination on not just hygiene, but testing.",99,,
892,0.97,7150.476,7162.788,"And quarantine and isolation and new housing units, you know, that there are a number of related components to this that are complicating factors.",99,,
893,0.97,7162.788,7171.697,"But we are leaning in, trying to bring as many solutions and bring it forward as we are happy to continue to engage with you and your colleagues as we will go here.",99,,
894,0.97,7171.697,7173.533,So thank you very much for your time.,99,,
895,0.97,7173.533,7174.767,I appreciate the opportunity.,99,,
896,0.97,7174.767,7176.903,"All right, thank you for the updates.",100,,
897,0.97,7176.903,7179.071,We appreciate it.,100,,
898,0.97,7179.071,7187.78,"You know, I know that it is a challenging time for all of us, so we appreciate you being more generous with your time than originally anticipated and to answer all your questions.",100,,
899,0.97,7187.78,7189.015,Thank you.,101,,
900,0.97,7189.015,7191.517,"Thank you, Casey.",102,,
901,0.97,7191.517,7195.421,"Thanks, council member.",103,,
902,0.97,7195.421,7202.395,"Okay, so I don't really have any additional closing remarks, and closing remarks that I made to deputy Mayor.",104,,
903,0.97,7202.395,7230.456,"And I'm sure that we will be working together with city central staff here and all of our Council colleagues to continue to respond to a lot of the issues that were discussed around making sure that those assets are being purchased or being deployed, and that we're doing outreach to make sure that people are made aware of these assets.",104,,
904,0.97,7230.456,7240.566,Likei mentioned a couple of times in the presentation that I have a map and a list that was provided to Jeff earlier in the week.,104,,
905,0.97,7240.566,7245.338,I do think that is a good way to start in being able to look at all the distribution of the assets.,104,,
