504,0.97,3412.108,3417.614,I find this slide to be very informative for me to explain what my limited experience in the space is with the trail regularly.,147,,
505,0.97,3417.614,3438.067,"There is a significant setback from the property to the single family zone as compared to what it could look like on a map, and it's just a line, as well as the grade and elevation change where this site would become at the same height as the properties to the left or to the South of this, and just keeping it at a consistent rate.",147,,
506,0.97,3438.067,3451.281,"I found this slide to be very informative demonstrating while on paper, it may seem like a large change, it's in keeping with the neighborhood and the environment there.",147,,
507,0.97,3451.281,3451.548,Sure.,148,,
508,0.97,3451.548,3519.148,"Moving on, this image shows the proposed building and street Scape, and the publically Plaza I mentioned around the retail, to the left of the building there, and the building kind of is set back further along that area, and so to allow for this more Plaza space on the private property, and as mentioned, although they are a bit ghosted out to allow for the viewer to see the actual building there will be Street trees and treatments including Bioretention designs that are on the private property, and then additional vegetation, and additional plantings along with the trees within the Right-Of-Way, and there will be--so currently there is not much of a sidewalk condition along this block, and it will actually create a more Walkable space with the new development.",149,,

513,0.97,3557.82,3564.227,"I have spent a lot of time on Blakely Avenue, and it's very different.",151,,
514,0.97,3564.227,3564.594,Very different.,151,,

520,0.97,3614.944,3623.786,"Can you remind us of the process for the contract Rezone, and what happens before it gets to this step at Council Committee in the process?",155,,
521,0.97,3623.786,3640.503,"Sure, what happens is that the applicant files with the Seattle Department of construction and inspections, and they go through the regular permit review, and getting the drawings in, and there's also the design review board will weigh in.",156,,
522,0.97,3640.503,3728.691,"That was part of the process as well, and so there's kind--it's a process for the developer, and once it's final--once that process is complete to the satisfaction of Sdci, they will then move on to the next process for the hearing Examiner to--so Sdci will issue its decision and recommendations, and also do the environmental review through CPA, and then once they have completed all of those aspects, that gets packaged up, and everything moves on to the hearing Examiner in who then considers the unit, looks at all information in the file, and considers that and issues a decision, a recommendation to the Council, which is where we are now, so that's--in this case, the Council has delegated to the hearing Examiner in to provide the opportunity for an open hearing on the matter which no one from the public actually spoke at that opportunity, and so, then the Council then considers what is in the record to make its decision on it, and should there be additional appeals or anything at that point, we will deal with that, but we did not receive any for this particular instance.",156,,
523,0.97,3728.691,3732.395,Is there a deadline for Council action?,157,,
524,0.97,3732.395,3743.039,"Given no appeals to hearings, the Council is required to take action within 90 days, and that would get us to March 9th, I think.",158,,

530,0.97,3765.695,3769.599,Question about the mandatory affording housing.,163,,
531,0.97,3769.599,3771.267,Any housing units on site?,163,,
532,0.97,3771.267,3780.81,"They are electing to participate in the multifamily property tax exception program, and it's voluntary.",164,,
533,0.97,3780.81,3789.085,They are electing to provide 20% affordable units at the 65% to 85%.,164,,
534,0.97,3789.085,3794.891,They will not be performing or building units under the affordable housing program.,164,,

536,0.97,3803.432,3806.769,If you have it handy.,165,,
537,0.97,3806.769,3835.064,"Based on, they--Yeah, the information they provided was slightly different from what I am going to provide in that they initially assumed the contract Rezone would be just the M suffix, not M1, they will be paying 1.8 or 1.9 million.",166,,
538,0.97,3835.064,3845.508,That's in exchange for an extra 10 feet essential?,167,,
539,0.97,3845.508,3845.842,Correct.,168,,
540,0.97,3845.842,3859.555,"10 feet in height, and in terms of the community engagement, you talked a little bit about the process in advance, and is there anything you can tell us about what the community engagement was?",169,,
541,0.97,3859.555,3865.494,Did the real estate developer go out to the community?,169,,
542,0.97,3865.494,3865.962,Asking their input?,169,,
543,0.97,3865.962,3911.841,"Based on the record, it looks like they held four meetings within the community Association, beginning in 2017, and so quite awhile now, and also with the Laurel Hurst community Association, and they held a number of coffee meetings with homeowners, and east of the site, the single family area we were discussing before, and you know, they responded to the feedback around some of the concerns of shading of the Burke Gilman, and they adopted the design to reduce the shading and narrowed the Footprint of the building a bit and added parking a concern as well from the community, and in the record, 38 letters of support for the Rezone as well from individual homeowners in the area.",170,,
544,0.97,3911.841,3912.441,Okay.,171,,
545,0.97,3912.441,3927.99,"It looks like you mentioned they added some parking on site, and it also looks like there is plenty of transit nearby, and so on San point way, 35th Avenue, 25th Avenue also.",172,,
546,0.97,3927.99,3953.416,"It's great that the density is being put where there is reliable transit, and it's probably premature to ask this question, but a lot of us are interested in seeing more Childcare facilities available throughout the city, in the ground floor retail space, it usually takes longer to fill up.",172,,
547,0.97,3953.416,3976.639,"We have a shortage of child care facilities, and make a conversation for later, but is it possible to put a Childcare facility in the ground floor there?",172,,
548,0.97,3976.639,3985.381,"So there's 2,000 square feet, approximately planned for a retail space, and based on the plans looking like two.",173,,
549,0.97,3985.381,3986.515,"Two 1,000 square foot spaces.",173,,
550,0.97,3986.515,3987.683,I'm not expert on Childcare.,173,,
551,0.97,3987.683,4016.445,"I have a child in Childcare, but it looks a lot bigger than 1,000 square feet may be needed for such a facility, but I also would need to look into that more, but my suspicion is that they--their intent is for it to be retail, like a cafe or restaurant, and that's with the sidewalk cafe kind of look to it, but that's not precluding the possibility of having child care facilities there, but I would need to have more information about space requirements for Childcare facilities.",173,,
552,0.97,4016.445,4019.248,Two more questions.,174,,
553,0.97,4019.248,4049.545,"Can I just Piggyback on that, within the community we will be taking up a number of initiatives to increase the Affordability and accessibility in spaces like this, ground floor in new buildings, I have found it to be difficult for local businesses, small businesses, and Childcare facilities to be placed, often times due to the renovation costs for child care code.",175,,
554,0.97,4049.545,4061.457,Cafe Turko an example of a great place that made what can be a space a Homey space.,175,,

557,0.97,4079.708,4081.51,"You mentioned support letters, and no appeal.",176,,
558,0.97,4081.51,4085.748,That's sort of a good sign about the community engagement support.,176,,
559,0.97,4085.748,4089.552,Any letters of opposition we know of?,176,,
560,0.97,4089.552,4095.391,"There were some E-Mails, I think, and that's a couple of E- mails.",177,,
561,0.97,4095.391,4098.327,I think those may have been early in the process.,177,,
562,0.97,4098.327,4114.543,"I don't want to say there was anything uniformly against it, but it seemed like the developer had responded to a lot of the community concern throughout the design review process and just meeting with folks and thus no appeals.",177,,
563,0.97,4114.543,4114.81,Okay.,178,,
564,0.97,4114.81,4121.217,Actually that's all I have.,178,,

570,0.97,4160.256,4160.756,Correct.,184,,

628,0.97,4770.999,4819.08,"Each has important expertise, aspects, and resources to the commitment, and we also know that coordination and collaboration is key, and to that effect, the executive created the city's urban forest court, and representatives from all the departments, and we meet often to make sure that we are Proactively communicating and coordinating our work, and one of the things we are doing is updating the urban forest management plan, and I will talk more about that, and we also have been working, and specifically on the tree relations, and we have also tapped the expertise and bounced ideas off of them, and we will continue to do that.",213,,
629,0.97,4819.08,4838.767,"The urban forest management plan setting the policies that guide our programs to accomplish our goals, and this work is being formed by information we gleam from the 2016 canopy cover assessment, and we learn a couple of things, and one is that at the time, we were 28% canopy cover.",213,,
630,0.97,4838.767,4845.407,"The goal that the plan has established is 30% by 2037, and we are at 28%.",213,,
631,0.97,4845.407,4865.627,We also learned that there tends to be fewer trees in areas of the city where there's a majority of people of color or low-income living these areas have 20% canopy coverage compared to 28% citywide.,213,,
632,0.97,4865.627,4867.229,That's something we are keeping in mind.,213,,
633,0.97,4867.229,4886.915,"We learned 72% of the canopy is in residential areas, and it's very important, you know, to realize that the city needs to work with the community on the stewardship of the trees, and the update has been working and focusing on inclusive engagement.",213,,
634,0.97,4886.915,4889.05,It's something we have not done properly in the past.,213,,
635,0.97,4889.05,4912.274,"This time we are making sure we are reaching to historically Underrepresented communities, communities of color, low income population, and basically isolated households, immigrants, Ref you refugees and native Americans.",213,,
636,0.97,4912.274,4919.18,We are working on the climate change objectives for stronger accountability.,213,,
637,0.97,4919.18,4923.051,"I forgot to say, please feel free to ask questions as we go along.",213,,
638,0.97,4923.051,4924.853,We are happy to answer at any time.,213,,
639,0.97,4924.853,4925.186,Thank you.,214,,
640,0.97,4925.186,4930.625,I just want to share where we are in terms of the forest management plan work.,215,,
641,0.97,4930.625,4961.323,"Before we began drafting the plan, we really wanted to make sure we got input, and so we partnered with Spu's commune connections program, part of the Spu's environmental justice and service equity group, and the idea was for them to work with Community-Based organizations and community liaisons to reach out to the Underserved community in culturally adequate and appropriate ways in any language.",215,,
642,0.97,4961.323,4978.707,"We held mission sessions with partners with tree advocates, and tree service providers, government agencies, volunteers and the urban forestry Commission, and we did an initial assessment on the city's programs and policies.",215,,
643,0.97,4978.707,4982.544,"We took all this information, and we produced the first draft.",215,,
644,0.97,4982.544,4999.094,"What we are doing now, we Reengaged the community connections to have them share with the community our draft goals, and the strategies and actions to make sure we are properly representing and reflecting the priorities they share with us.",215,,
645,0.97,4999.094,5001.83,This work is going to be wrapping up this month.,215,,
646,0.97,5001.83,5008.269,We have also been working on incorporating the departmental input into the draft plan.,215,,
647,0.97,5008.269,5029.19,"In the next steps as we undertake engagement we are going to be preparing a draft, sharing with the public for public input in this reporter, and they are going to incorporate the input and share a final draft with Council in late 2020.",215,,
648,0.97,5029.19,5033.695,"With that, somehow Shandra will be sharing protections for tree regulations.",215,,
649,0.97,5033.695,5034.095,Thank you.,216,,
650,0.97,5034.095,5046.474,"I would like to first mention the progress we have made so far, and we have increased education information and improved enforcement and increased resources and staff.",216,,
651,0.97,5046.474,5068.063,"As far as education, we have updated the Sdci Website for new advice on the tip sheets and new information about the value of trees and ways to include plain language in the Website for understanding what the existing regulations say.",216,,
652,0.97,5068.063,5081.776,"As far as enforcement, we have updated or recently adopted a new director's role, and in the new director's role, it clarifies how fees are calculated when trees are cut down illegally.",216,,
653,0.97,5081.776,5117.779,"It's very important, and it also gives us the ability to--it gave us the ability to increase the fees as a greater deterrent for illegal tree cutting, and Sdci has hired two Arborists to help us with plan reviews, and they are also helping with code enforcement cases and as well as conducting Trainings for our staff at Sdci.",216,,
654,0.97,5117.779,5124.586,Councilmember?,217,,
655,0.97,5124.586,5126.054,Thank you so much Mr. chair.,218,,
656,0.97,5126.054,5150.011,"Going back to talk about the new director's role, and I--I don't know if there's a summary of the clarification of the fees somewhere else in the presentation or not, but one of my Takeaways from an extensive meeting with Sdci earlier this month I had, it was that the current schedule and formula for assessing the fees is fairly Disteen and a little convoluted based on a bunch of factors.",218,,
657,0.97,5150.011,5163.057,"One thing I took away from that, the Department would like to see, even more of a kind of clarifying or stream lined piece of the ordinance that this committee will ultimately pass.",218,,
658,0.97,5163.057,5165.527,It provides more clarity on that.,218,,
659,0.97,5165.527,5175.737,I was just,218,,
660,0.97,5284.679,5289.15,"Just this past year we were able to assess a fine of $33,000 for a tree that was removed with this rule.",219,,
661,0.97,5289.15,5290.351,That was just one tree.,219,,
662,0.97,5290.351,5291.352,A job well done.,220,,
663,0.97,5291.352,5291.686,Thanks.,221,,
664,0.97,5291.686,5318.846,"I would just mention, too that in response to Council member Lewis's question, we have made improvements with this role and recognize there are still some--there is still some more work to do with enforcement so we would continue to make this easy to use and to make sure it is the strongest deterrent that it can be.",222,,
665,0.97,5318.846,5319.881,I have a follow-up question.,223,,
666,0.97,5319.881,5320.715,I appreciate the clarification.,223,,
667,0.97,5320.715,5355.783,"Part of my concern is that while we are in a position to let the appropriate finds, given the exact specification of the tree that is being removed and that can better quantify using that tree, part of my concern is that if we have an enforcement method that is sort of based on a formula or based on--like I, I worry that this scale can be minimized because I don't know that the owner of the $33,000 tree necessarily was where that that was potentially what the penalty would have been.",223,,
668,0.97,5355.783,5370.131,"So in order for it to be a deterrence, the impact, we are speaking to someone who is a Prosecutor before I came to the Council, the deterrent has to be a and an effective strategy and the penalty has to be a deterrent to the person who is considering the conduct.",223,,
669,0.97,5370.131,5409.771,"So, I mean, I am all for having higher, you know, statutorily delineated penalties if that is what it comes down to but it is something that I would like the departments guidance on to know what that would be and how it would be set or maybe if there would be like Differet tiers of penalty, kind of based on broad categories of the tree, even if that leads to a regime where people that would be penalized under the current regime might end up paying a little more than they would have under we--what we are now and some wood end up paying a little less so the clarity might be worth it is a Trade- off in terms of the power of the deterrent.",223,,
670,0.97,5409.771,5414.408,We will work on that and put it back into a future committee.,224,,
671,0.97,5414.408,5414.675,Good.,225,,
672,0.97,5414.675,5415.143,Thank you.,226,,
673,0.97,5415.143,5435.83,"And when we do, when you meet with us further, if there is anything we can do to help to provide greater resources for enforcement, we would love to know what those aren't do you know them right this moment?",227,,
674,0.97,5435.83,5438.466,"I would love to follow up with you than actually, thank you.",227,,
675,0.97,5438.466,5439.0,Thank you.,228,,
676,0.97,5439.0,5459.787,"So currently, we are working on a number of issues right now and some of the highlights that I would like to share with you today is that we are expecting to issue a new draft requisite shortly and our hope is to strengthen the tree growth definition, add clarity and strengthen tree protection measures for both significant and exceptional trees and then require mitigation for tree removal including an affidavit for tree service providers that we will need to provide a signature prior to doing business in the city.",228,,
677,0.97,5459.787,5463.624,This would be acknowledging that they are aware of our current tree regulations.,228,,
678,0.97,5463.624,5476.304,"The other thing is that this new directors rule, we are looking to provide greater protections for large and mature trees these which we have heard.",228,,
679,0.97,5476.304,5477.839,Another thing we are working on is tree tracking.,228,,
680,0.97,5477.839,5479.907,We are looking with SDC I as per Seattle's I.T.,228,,
681,0.97,5479.907,5494.155,"To develop new business practices including technology updates to track trees on the site plant . This will include preserved trees, existing trees, planted trees, trees parted in mitigation.",228,,
682,0.97,5494.155,5499.26,This will allow us to make adjustments as needed and then monitor the progress.,228,,
683,0.97,5499.26,5521.482,Another thing that we are doing right now with Scdi and Osc is working towards public outreach and we have heard that public outreach needs to be done in a culturally--go ahead.,228,,
684,0.97,5521.482,5525.152,"Sorry, I wanted to ask something really quick before we left from the work underway slide.",229,,
685,0.97,5525.152,5525.586,Okay.,230,,
686,0.97,5525.586,5532.66,I want to go back and maybe ask a little bit more about the conversation on the updated mitigation for tree removal.,231,,
687,0.97,5532.66,5532.894,Yes.,232,,
688,0.97,5532.894,5535.696,Before we move further.,233,,
689,0.97,5535.696,5554.949,"I am kind of curious--I know, that is going to be for me, at least, one of the main things I am looking for in designing this ordinance and part of the reason being, you know, we are a major city, one of the fastest growing cities in the country.",233,,
690,0.97,5554.949,5566.427,"We are going to have more--more housing, we need to add more housing, we have a housing crisis, inevitably some trees are going to have to be removed to make way for that growth and that the relevant.",233,,
691,0.97,5566.427,5581.042,"So inevitably, we are going to have to explore meaningful mitigation that can compensate for the loss of those trees that do ultimately have to be removed for projects that are essential.",233,,
692,0.97,5581.042,5588.049,"So that is something that, as far as we can shape it early, I would kind of like to know where their conversation is now, if you are comfortable sharing a little bit more.",233,,
693,0.97,5588.049,5602.229,The ordinance as it stands does not allow for trees to be removed when that would not allow the development in the anticipated zones go forward.,234,,
694,0.97,5602.229,5604.231,Most often we see that in single and multifamily zones.,234,,
695,0.97,5604.231,5618.479,Current mitigation is--exceptional trees be removed when there in the multi family and--zones and the code gives the director authority to define the exceptional trees and set forth the mitigation provisions in this rule and so that is what we are looking at the role now.,234,,
696,0.97,5618.479,5625.786,It is a way to enhance the protections of trees with those two as kind of the dilemmas at play in the rule.,234,,
697,0.97,5625.786,5659.42,"We have a list of species of trees and sizes of the trunks that helps to define them as exceptional and we are doing some analysis now to see if we might increase the number of trees, reduce the size of the trunks that would qualify us--as protected that would lead to enhanced mitigation of some of those trees should be allowed to be removed as part of the development process as well as the looking to model such as important from what they require and we do allow protected trees to be removed.",234,,
698,0.97,5659.42,5663.057,That could also be something that would be housed in this rule.,234,,
699,0.97,5663.057,5669.83,"Orbit some of the mitigation strategies be so like In-Kind replacement, of trees, like in lieu fees, I would imagine would be one?",235,,
700,0.97,5669.83,5677.805,I'm just kind of curious like how the conversation is evolving now and what some of those strategies might be.,235,,
701,0.97,5677.805,5698.059,"The code now supports a mitigation program that would incorporate replacement requirements at certain levels in the Portland model, certain winds of trees, there is a one- to-one replacement requirement and species compatibility and for larger trees, it is more of an In-Kind replacement.",236,,
702,0.97,5698.059,5704.565,They do allow for payment in lieu of--in Portland that is something that we have been asked to explore in resolution that we talked about at the beginning of the meeting.,236,,
703,0.97,5704.565,5714.475,That may or may not be something we can accomplish in this role but it is on that table for us to take a look at.,236,,
704,0.97,5714.475,5745.372,"That is an excellent response and I will share that I have right here, volume number 1 of multiple volumes of what the city of Portland did to study and implement their tree ordinance and right now, we will be having quarterly briefings about the tree ordinance and the progress that we are making toward this first briefing--focused on the current schedule and budget of Lamenting and creating the tree ordinance and so we will talk more about Portland.",237,,
705,0.97,5745.372,5748.609,Those questions you just raised are exactly the questions we need to have answered this year.,237,,
706,0.97,5748.609,5755.583,Right and I'm trying to take advantage of the committee to give a little feedback to the departments in terms of flagging things of future interest to myself so I appreciate your indulging that.,238,,
707,0.97,5755.583,5760.821,"I have a little bit of a Follow- up with that, too, in mind.",238,,
708,0.97,5760.821,5788.115,One thing I have been doing a lot of recently is researching potential methods to incorporate the public health and global climate change impacts the trees have with emerging Technologies or urban design practices.,238,,
709,0.97,5788.282,5815.843,"One things I found interesting is the start of developments of these things coal city trees that have been developed in some Western European countries, a German startup company called green city solutions is pushing an article reported to be about $20,000 per tree so an amalgamation of Moss panels that have the effect, when put together of about 275 individual traditional trees in terms of having an effect on the heat Island effect and improved air quality.",238,,
710,0.97,5815.843,5831.926,"If there are ways to create incentives for people to design and review or incentives for developers to incorporate these kinds of things into their structure, really early in the process, as a potential mitigation strategy, it would be something I would be interested in.",238,,
711,0.97,5831.926,5873.734,"Looking at it, I understand that there are additional aesthetic considerations as well as erosion control considerations of trees that would be separate from those but, you know, I am, I want to make sure that in designing this ordinance we are truly designing an ordinance around protecting essential trees rather than something that could be used to prevent unwanted development, purely to prevent unwanted development so that is going to be something that I am interested in looking into and seeing if we can start the project Eastman published even earlier to incorporate--with emerging Technologies as well as well as.",238,,
712,0.97,5873.734,5882.443,Took protecting historically significant essential trees that are irreplaceable.,238,,
713,0.97,5882.443,5889.75,We are happy to work with you on those interests and we will work with your staff so that we can take a look at that evolution and help you out with that.,239,,
714,0.97,5889.75,5891.652,Thank you.,240,,
715,0.97,5891.652,5892.052,Thank you.,241,,
716,0.97,5892.052,5911.739,So Scdi and Osc are dedicated to committing resources to engage in a culturally appropriate way for historically Underrepresented communities especially areas of the city that are low income and have low tree canopy coverage right now.,241,,
717,0.97,5911.739,5922.283,It may be a good fit for us to work with the Department of neighborhoods or Sbu's community connections to do this the right way.,241,,
718,0.97,5922.283,5929.69,"We have heard and we would like the public outreach efforts including many people including homeowners, Renters, developers, builders, realtors, neighborhood groups and environmental organizations and climate and environmental justice organizations 2 name a few.",241,,
719,0.97,5929.69,5969.229,"Reservations I-190 to was issued by city Council and identifies strategies to explore and protect trees in Seattle, including strategies for retaining up Sectional trees exceptional trees including the definition of exceptional trees, adopting a definition of significant trees at a replacement requirements for significant tree removal and simple thing the tree planting and replacement requirements including mitigation and it also directs Scdi to look into establishing a payment or payment in lieu of option for Treeplanting that could potentially be in situations where there is not enough space to plant trees in the city.",241,,
720,0.97,5969.229,5983.243,"Then as I stated previously, tree tracking Removals and replacement and requiring all tree service providers to meet member requirements.",241,,
721,0.97,5983.243,5991.218,One thing I would like to point out here is we do not know what the right threshold is at this point for defining significant trees in that but we are exploring a wide range of options right now.,241,,
722,0.97,5991.218,6008.435,"Many of these tasks described here do require a great deal of complexity and exploration and just the fact that this is a tree, a living thing in an urban environment --",241,,
723,0.97,6008.435,6010.104,Can I ask one question really quick?,242,,
724,0.97,6010.104,6010.871,Absolutely.,243,,
725,0.97,6010.871,6014.141,I want to go back to talking about the exploration of the in lieu fee.,244,,
726,0.97,6014.141,6047.007,"Just a flag that at this early stage while we are still looking into it, just to make sure that equity is a big consideration for the Department in exploring it in the sense of, as we are removing trees, one thing I would be concerned about is if we are removing a whole bunch of trees for like Townhouse development in the South end or Somehing, if developers are in lieu of placing them, so we are sort of D4 sting one part of the city to force another part, that would be something I'm concerned about.",244,,
727,0.97,6047.007,6067.194,I want to make sure those considerations are shaping how we are exploring in ways we could incorporate equity like In-Kind replacement within the same neighborhood or at least making sure that some of the replacement remains in the same neighborhood.,244,,
728,0.97,6067.194,6077.404,"Council member, one thing we are doing right now is working with a University of Washington graduate student on her thesis and she is doing a the in lieu study nationwide including worldwide of other jurisdictions that are using the fee in lieu successfully.",245,,
729,0.97,6077.404,6079.64,Thank you so much.,246,,
730,0.97,6079.64,6086.847,Yes.,247,,
731,0.97,6086.847,6095.789,"So this is the proposed schedule which shows, I believe, substantial progress on tree protection updates that have accomplished various milestones throughout the year.",247,,
732,0.97,6095.789,6097.958,"As you stated previously, the work does include reporting quarterly.",247,,
733,0.97,6097.958,6115.776,"As you can see here in March, Scdi will be completing the work on exceptional tree directors rule and we are going to be continuing to work on the tree tracking efforts . in April and may, we will be developing the outreach materials and in May and June, conducting public outreach.",247,,
734,0.97,6115.776,6137.998,"And September and October, Scdi expects to be at the point where we can summarize and respond back to the public outreach feedback, conduct a technical analysis and be prepared to draft tree protection updates or draft legislation as warranted including the--review.",247,,
735,0.97,6137.998,6145.706,And then in October we will be drafting the recommendations to the Mayor with issuing a--decision in Mayer.,247,,
736,0.97,6145.706,6149.409,The final recommendations to the Mayor and Council would occur in December.,247,,
737,0.97,6149.409,6158.519,"As far as budget,--yes?",247,,
738,0.97,6158.519,6176.637,"I appreciate the schedule and I know in the last attempt to pass a tree ordinance, even before I worked on it so apologies to anyone in the crowd who may have more detailed information about--it is my information that a--appeared appeal did appear and it took that off track . is that correct in my understanding?",248,,
739,0.97,6176.637,6184.945,I want to highlight that your proposed schedule which I find to be appropriately aggressive is dependent upon the fact that there is not a--appeal.,248,,
740,0.97,6184.945,6187.648,Is that a correct understanding?,248,,
741,0.97,6187.648,6203.664,If there were a Sep a appeal it could stretch the Timeline further approximately about 6 months.,249,,
742,0.97,6203.664,6217.277,This would tend to emphasize that we have talked in committee today that there are a number of tree enhancements that can occur that don't necessarily include a trench one evaluation as part of the resources being brought to bear.,250,,
743,0.97,6217.277,6219.68,"This is practice, updates, technology updates and rules are examples of those.",250,,
744,0.97,6219.68,6223.884,We do intend to come to committee with progress reports on various steps like that on the way.,250,,
745,0.97,6223.884,6231.658,Thank you.,250,,
746,0.97,6231.658,6244.071,"So as far as the budget, Scdi expects to complete the tree protection updates using existing staff resources from code development, Land-Use services, engineering services and cold--code compliance workers on the technology work for tree tracking is already in the existing I.T.",251,,
747,0.97,6244.071,6244.404,Budget.,251,,
748,0.97,6244.404,6272.532,"Great and if you could follow up with me after this Committee, whether back of the envelope or detailed analysis of what that real cost is to your Department for using your existing resources and also, what projections you may have beyond this fiscal year as to what fiscal resources you will need to implement this work.",252,,
749,0.97,6272.532,6273.333,Thank you.,253,,
750,0.97,6273.333,6279.873,"Especially considering if there is a Sepa appeal that this schedule would take longer, I want to make sure we have an accurate understanding of the resources that are needed.",254,,
751,0.97,6279.873,6280.24,Thank you.,255,,
752,0.97,6280.24,6280.707,Make sure.,255,,
753,0.97,6280.707,6280.941,Please?,255,,
754,0.97,6280.941,6282.609,Thank you again for being here today.,256,,
755,0.97,6282.609,6292.953,I just wanted to signify some of the things that were important . a lot of this is exactly what we heard today and what we have heard--I have heard the past couple of years on this.,256,,
756,0.97,6292.953,6312.873,"Piggybacking off of what Council member Lewis said, viewing it through the race and social justice lens, the heat map we were shown today shows how important that is . There are health benefits for trees in addition to climate benefits so we want those to be in the neighborhoods that are currently lacking trees.",256,,
757,0.97,6312.873,6335.929,"Also, I want to flag a concern about the in lieu fund as a solution because what I have really heard from Portland is that that is not a working solution for them and certainly it is Arguable, we could argue whether it is working for mandatory housing Affordability program, too.",256,,
758,0.97,6335.929,6396.256,"We need to have the fees high enough so that people are going to try to preserve the trees because preserving the trees is more important, I think, for the health benefits and the climate benefits than planting smaller trees . The idea of the 24 hour Hotline that we heard today, providing more notice, two weeks of notice, having, I think you already Referenced having Arborists who are allowed to cut down a tree that they are registered with the city . Then having--I think we need to talk about at a next meeting perhaps, putting more emphasis on the office of Sustainability environment to oversee the enforcement . There was mention of having an independent Forster whose job and mission it is to protect trees so they have an equal voice at the table when decisions are being made and Plicies being enforced.",256,,
759,0.97,6396.256,6408.869,Because Scdi already has a lot to consider in their scope of work for helping manage growth in the city so I would like to see more emphasis on--environmental emphasis to enforce the ordinance.,256,,
760,0.97,6408.869,6432.626,"Then this Timeline, at first glance, it appears too slow to me . I think maybe I am not understanding--the final recommendations to the Mayor and Council, what I would be hoping to see is an ordinance that is actually delivered with the Council before--will be for the End-Of-The-Year.",256,,
761,0.97,6432.626,6458.585,"It would be nice to get it before the budget but I just want to understand that--I know you are doing administrative work like directors rule which is helpful to do stuff while you can do it but in terms of the legislation, I think in the resolution, that was passed by the previous Council and so forth, saying, please send us an ordinance so I am hoping we are going to get an ordinance by the End-Of-The-Year.",256,,
762,0.97,6458.585,6471.798,"I understand your interest in that and certainly, have listened to the testimony as well so we will report that back to the director and the Mayor's office and talk to you some more about the schedule.",257,,
763,0.97,6471.798,6472.132,Okay.,258,,
764,0.97,6472.132,6477.003,"I appreciate those comments, council member Pedersen because I share a strong interest in having as aggressive of an approach as possible with this.",259,,
765,0.97,6477.003,6513.773,"When I looked into the tree ordinance and we have, I believe, for the public copy as well, this volume 1 of the recommended draft report to their city council in December 2010 SETS out very similar setup of what Lse and Scdi have presented to us as far as project Ramp-Up, outreach manuals, title changes, hires for a lot of these programs seeking funding and so I will kind of walk through what Portland's approach was because their approach took 9 years.",259,,
766,0.97,6513.773,6521.781,And what Scdi and Osc are preventing--presenting to us would take 1 year so I just want to share with everyone that.,259,,
767,0.97,6521.781,6566.426,"It is my strong desire to have as aggressive of a schedule as possible and so for Portland in fall of 2007 and winter of 2008, they hired additional staff as compared to using existing staff to bring together all of their departments, conduct case studies and begin collecting feedback and some of that work has already been done because in Seattle, we have, as we have heard, some folks have been working on this for a decade, some have been working on this for two decades and so there is now a direct alignment of our two processes because we have set doubled his have had so many Council members start and stop and start and stop on this work.",259,,
768,0.97,6566.426,6590.05,"What I want to share with the public is this is this is the first meeting before the land use & amp; neighborhoods so rest assured in fall of 2007, we began this work and in spring, we committed a decision group, members represented from neighborhood groups, environmental organizations, builders, forestry Commission and county drainage district members provided advice but were not expected to generate consensus.",259,,
769,0.97,6590.05,6629.789,"In winter of 2008, to the winter of 2010, the work group summarized key issues and feedback, drafted proposed resolution and program recommendations based on feedback received so again, that is a period of 3 years that you are looking to condense 10 years of fits and starts work to be done in a year so again I'm trying to mirror and compare two different processes for Portland and winter of 2010 to spring of 2011, there were at least proposals to the public hosted at open houses.",259,,
770,0.97,6629.789,6644.07,The urban forestry and planning commissions helped held work sessions and engage with the directors of departments that would be impacted and the legislation was revised to reflect the feedback that had been received.,259,,
771,0.97,6644.07,6691.918,"Then the Council adopted their true regulations in 2011 soap from 2007 two two--from 2007 two 2011 you are looking to accomplish in 1 your and then the implementation was supposed to occur in February 2013 and due to budget constraints was pushed to 2015 and that is why I ask, what are the resources you need to move forward so that I know now so that we are not caught flat footed because it is my understanding--and again a question I would love to know is, looking at this page 6 on the volume 1 that there is, you know, the fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2015 represented in this chart . What other startup costs that would be needed to get this program running?",259,,
772,0.97,6691.918,6710.17,"Because I understand that once the program is running, there will be few recovery that we will have to rely on to operate the program and it is very important for me to know early on how much money will be required to get this program started so that we don't end up in a situation like Portland where there are things that are not working as well.",259,,
773,0.97,6710.17,6761.421,"I think that there is--we had great benefit in seeing Portland now having their tree ordinance and Lamented for 5 years to understand because we know that it takes policy 4 years to really start working the way it was designed to work and so we have that benefit to see how their process did and did not work so for all of these reasons, we are--we have 10 to 20 years depending on how long you have been engaged in this process--4 to 10 Council members I would say who have taken this up, an effort where this is the second Council meeting and we have 4 straight years and--Council member Lewis, can I allow you to the wisdom to with the Council members to get this done?",259,,
774,0.97,6761.421,6763.49,So 3 Council members is a Quorum on the committee.,260,,
775,0.97,6763.49,6768.194,-- Commission so--Commission involved for 10 years since it was created in 2009.,261,,
776,0.97,6768.194,6774.2,"Exactly so I just want to take this moment to share that a process that took a decade in Portland, you are looking to accomplish in 1 year.",262,,
777,0.97,6774.2,6781.407,"So I--that, that is a schedule that I can get behind and I agree with you, council member Pedersen.",262,,
778,0.97,6781.407,6789.949,I would like to see the ordinance as soon as possible.,262,,
779,0.97,6789.949,6792.018,I just want to make sure it is good policy.,262,,
780,0.97,6792.018,6796.689,There was a public comment earlier Referencing policy that was quickly passed just this year and there are many policy implications.,262,,
781,0.97,6796.689,6814.674,There are going to be a lot of unintended consequences with legislation that is rushed and that is why I am very dedicated to see it go as fast as possible and developed as properly as possible.,262,,
782,0.97,6814.674,6829.455,Right and something that we did not mention is actually Scdi has been working with a group of internal experts and also members of the Commission to have conversations to grapple with issues jointly and to hear their position and kind of continue that partnership as well.,263,,
783,0.97,6829.455,6830.056,Great.,264,,
784,0.97,6830.056,6837.564,"Great, thank you.",265,,
785,0.97,6837.564,6838.264,Any further thoughts?,266,,
786,0.97,6838.264,6842.068,"So I just wanted, again, do you have any further thoughts on this presentation?",266,,
787,0.97,6842.068,6848.975,"So I want to thank anyone here, scope, schedule is appropriate.",266,,
788,0.97,6848.975,6867.627,"I am looking forward to the next quarterly report I will be working together throughout--before then, and for the general public and for the record, one of my first meetings that I took as Council member was meeting with Arborists, very skilled Arborists who understand what--where are opportunities aware.",266,,
789,0.97,6867.627,6868.895,Balls Maybe with this legislation.,266,,
790,0.97,6868.895,6892.018,"I understand the parameters for me when the legislation is able vented, it needs to be easily understand for a Layperson, easy to comply with, so that people are complying, the fee needs to be low enough so that people use the fee and it needs to be high enough to cover cost--for the program.",266,,
791,0.97,6892.018,6917.944,We have the ability to say the trees that we have and create the density we meet need that may meet knee mean we provide extra height for an area to ensure there is enough soil and places for trees to properly grow and we absolutely must retreat historically marginalized and low income communities because we see health benefits tied to these trees.,266,,
792,0.97,6917.944,6951.778,"We see industrial areas and industrial and adjacent industrial areas with historically marginalized communities are living as compared to the residential neighborhoods that have historically large amounts of trees that are not near the manufacturing and production that everyone uses so we need to make sure this is an equitable approach . growing up in the city, I remember the efforts such as retrieve ballot and once previous to that so I am looking forward to retrieving our city.",266,,
793,0.97,6951.778,6952.578,Thank you.,267,,
794,0.97,6952.578,6956.482,If there is nothing further--anything I can help you with?,268,,
795,0.97,6956.482,6966.926,"No, thank you so much.",269,,
796,0.97,6970.496,6971.831,Thank you for joining us today.,269,,
797,0.97,6971.831,6974.767,I am looking forward to continuing work with you in strengthening our tree protections.,269,,
798,0.97,6974.767,6980.006,Your project presentation was very well done and I appreciate all the work you did so quickly to get this done for the first committee hearing.,269,,
