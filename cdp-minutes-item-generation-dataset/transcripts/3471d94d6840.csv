68,0.97,384.117,396.195,Those were foremost in find when the 2017 accountability ordinance was drafted which is why there are three appointing bodies and not just one like there was before.,4,,
69,0.97,396.195,411.644,"I want to read from when I made the decision to finally leave, I wrote a message to my Cochairs when I want today address that the CPC is overly confrontational.",4,,

120,0.97,754.353,761.894,But they also have been brought forward by different appointing authorities.,14,,

128,0.97,795.561,802.768,The CPC was set up on the settlement agreement.,15,,
129,0.97,802.768,809.909,Of 2012 when the DOJ came back with a finding of unconstitutional policing in Seattle.,15,,
130,0.97,809.909,825.224,The community police Commission came from that and over time it has become permanent with the legislation in 2017 for police accountability into work for police reform and to engage the community.,15,,

132,0.97,827.826,828.16,Thank you.,16,,
133,0.97,828.16,845.277,I think one of the things that is really unique about the CPC is it is not a staff driven agency.,16,,
134,0.97,845.277,848.214,The work of the CPC is the work of the commissioners.,16,,
135,0.97,848.214,856.388,That's why so many of the responsibilities require such a commitment of time and energy.,16,,
136,0.97,856.388,862.027,The expectation is individual CPC members are representing their communities.,16,,
137,0.97,862.027,865.865,"Not, the work product is not a product of staff.",16,,
138,0.97,865.865,874.373,It is really a product of what you do and who you represent.,16,,
139,0.97,874.373,893.993,"And so, the responsibilities include not only producing annual reports, you also have an official role in being able to do filings as part of the consent decree.",16,,
140,0.97,893.993,903.335,"And, you are also Tasked with providing technical assistance and the office of the inspector general.",16,,
141,0.97,903.335,910.776,Your task with identifying and advocating to reforms to state laws.,16,,

143,0.97,916.382,920.619,"To do that, you have to go out and get community feedback.",16,,
144,0.97,920.619,939.438,Your task with maintaining connections with representatives of disenfranchised communities and all of the cities' seven Council districts as well as with SPD demographic and precinct advisory councils.,16,,
145,0.97,939.438,966.732,"And, another important role is specifically ensuring that we are informed about how from a policy perspective, the police accountability system, police services, SPD policies and practices of significance to the public are really addressing the needs of our diverse communities throughout the city.",16,,
146,0.97,966.732,973.872,So I really appreciate your willingness to serve in this really important role.,16,,
147,0.97,973.872,985.284,And I think a really important time in the work that we all have to do together.,16,,
148,0.97,985.284,990.689,Both to enhance constitutional policing while also insuring that we are addressing the public safety needs of our community.,16,,
149,0.97,990.689,1001.6,"So with that, I will turn it over to each of you to talk about why it is that you are interested in serving in this role.",16,,
150,0.97,1001.6,1008.507,"And, if you could each of you say whether or not you are Repointed.",16,,
151,0.97,1008.507,1012.144,"Are you pointed by the CPC, the Mayor, or the Council.",16,,

268,0.97,1850.215,1870.368,So I think that it is really important that we maintain the leadership she provides and the legitimacy she gives to the CPC because her strong ties to the community and her able to represent the need of the community.,29,,
269,0.97,1870.368,1873.872,I have just a couple of questions.,29,,
270,0.97,1873.872,1884.382,I would love to ask the nominees if that's okay.,29,,
271,0.97,1884.382,1886.451,I know Reverend Walden had a point she wanted to make.,29,,
272,0.97,1886.451,1888.319,I wanted to get these questions on the table.,29,,
273,0.97,1888.319,1896.628,I want to hear from your perspective is on the consent decree with the Department of justice.,29,,
274,0.97,1896.628,1897.895,As well as just real high level.,29,,
275,0.97,1897.895,1904.869,What part of the work of the CPC is most important to you.,29,,
276,0.97,1904.869,1920.418,"Well I think that for me, the highest level of the consent decree that is really important is the accountability piece.",30,,
277,0.97,1920.418,1934.265,I think that holding people accountable to what they are suppose today be doing versus what they think that they can do is a little bit different.,30,,
278,0.97,1934.265,1944.842,And so that is really important to me.,30,,
279,0.97,1944.842,1953.418,And having things be equitable across the board and communities served the same way regardless of your skin color.,30,,
280,0.97,1953.418,1954.385,Thank you.,31,,
281,0.97,1954.385,1960.191,"So, my my perspective is it is probably one of the best thing Tht's Happenedin the city of Seattle.",32,,
282,0.97,1960.191,1964.329,We are not--the consent decree did not change the way things were done.,32,,
283,0.97,1964.329,1975.473,"Those are the things, those are the ways things have always been done and put a spotlight on it.",32,,
284,0.97,1975.473,1982.68,So the fact the consent decree forced us to address those issues is one of the best things that happened to the city.,32,,
285,0.97,1982.68,1991.422,I think it should happen to more cities and it forces us to look at the issues and address them.,32,,
286,0.97,1991.422,2003.201,I think the way we work out of it is really important and it will involve all efforts and I do believe the majority of the city wants to do that.,32,,
287,0.97,2003.201,2018.95,But we have to do it in a way that deeply impacts the way things are going forward.,32,,
288,0.97,2018.95,2022.987,So addressing it with Sustainability will be most important.,32,,
289,0.97,2022.987,2044.809,"I think the Federal consent decree was a critical first step in addressing broken relationships with the community on instituting you know, more community policing and relational policing models.",33,,
290,0.97,2044.809,2049.147,"And, there has been some really great progress that has come out of the consent decree.",33,,
291,0.97,2049.147,2055.052,We have is a ground breaking system of police accountability here in the city of Seattle.,33,,
292,0.97,2055.052,2067.832,"And, an opportunity to continue to move that work forward no matter what happens with the consent decree in the next year or so.",33,,
293,0.97,2067.832,2077.675,"So, what I'm most excited about is continuing the progress that has been made through the CPC and the process of community leadership here in the city of Seattle.",33,,
294,0.97,2077.675,2086.384,"Continuing to advance those upstream prevention tactics including Deescalation training, implicit bias training.",33,,
295,0.97,2086.384,2092.123,"And, tools and tactics that can help prevent conflicts between community and police from happening in the first place.",33,,
296,0.97,2092.123,2092.49,Thank you.,34,,
297,0.97,2092.49,2107.538,"And I think one of the things that is really important to note about this particular consent decree, I believe we are the first in the nation to have a citizen oversight body be an official party of record.",34,,
298,0.97,2107.538,2116.914,That's really a big deal being Replicated in other cities.,34,,
299,0.97,2116.914,2123.287,That means your work throughout the process of oversight is also really important.,34,,
300,0.97,2123.287,2131.195,You have a role to submit filings along with the city.,34,,
301,0.97,2131.195,2136.934,On the different stages of oversight at the consent decree and into the Sustainment period.,34,,
302,0.97,2136.934,2140.805,So that is not just important in itself.,34,,
303,0.97,2140.805,2145.71,It is important in the big picture of national police reform efforts.,34,,
304,0.97,2145.71,2175.773,"Because, if you use your role in a way that we can demonstrate is helpful to addressing police accountability reform, then we can be sure that relationship of the community with consent decree cover sight is enshrined throughout the community.",34,,
305,0.97,2175.773,2179.644,So super important and I appreciate your willingness to serve.,34,,
306,0.97,2179.644,2187.818,If there are no other questions what I will do is I will move items one through six.,34,,

338,0.97,2342.173,2346.377,So Greg will kick us off with a quick overview of why we are here today.,46,,
339,0.97,2346.377,2346.744,Thank you.,47,,
340,0.97,2346.744,2358.322,"So, I'm going to start out to talk about the 2019 year end staffing data that is transmitted to the Council monthly.",47,,
341,0.97,2358.322,2359.256,The data is transmitted monthly.,47,,
342,0.97,2359.256,2362.593,The particular data we are looking at is for the end of 2019.,47,,
343,0.97,2362.593,2367.565,"And then, I will turn it over to the Department to talk about their recruiting activities over the last year.",47,,
344,0.97,2367.565,2371.168,"And, what they have got planned for the upcoming year.",47,,
345,0.97,2371.168,2376.974,"And as part of that presentation, they may be touching on the Mayor's recruitment and retention initiative.",47,,
346,0.97,2376.974,2381.245,I know that was talked about a bit yesterday in the press conference.,47,,
347,0.97,2381.245,2391.722,"So, as background, I'm sure most folks are aware that in 2018, the Department experienced difficulty hiring new officers while also realizing a higher than normal separation rate.",47,,
348,0.97,2391.722,2401.332,These challenges led to a net decrease of 41 of the number of officers decreased.,47,,
349,0.97,2401.332,2403.1,There is that negative 41 right there.,47,,
350,0.97,2403.1,2404.668,"So, I will walk you through this table.",47,,
351,0.97,2404.668,2410.541,So you understand what you are looking at.,47,,
352,0.97,2410.541,2412.91,You have recruits that are hired.,47,,
353,0.97,2412.91,2421.418,Laterals that are brought in and Laterals are folks that are hired from other police agencies or Rehires.,47,,
354,0.97,2421.418,2424.655,"Separations, folks that are Levering the Department.",47,,
355,0.97,2424.655,2430.161,And net new hires is the difference between those three columns.,47,,
356,0.97,2430.161,2436.834,"All sworn officers are all officers, all support personnel that have taken the oath.",47,,
357,0.97,2436.834,2450.181,"The reason I mention that is because, when someone gets hired into the Department, they go through a period of five to six months of the Academy.",47,,
358,0.97,2450.181,2452.049,They don't take the sworn oath immediately.,47,,
359,0.97,2452.049,2464.061,"There is a bit of a delay before they become sworn in officers and there's a further delay once they graduate the Academy, they have to do ride along training before they become a fully trained officer.",47,,
360,0.97,2464.061,2476.774,"I point this out so you understand as you are moving along this table, you can't add these numbers together and you can't say 16 net new hires, plus 1388 will equal 1371.",47,,
361,0.97,2476.774,2481.545,There's the delay in the training.,47,,
362,0.97,2481.545,2485.95,"As you can see here, in 2018, there was the net 41.",47,,
363,0.97,2485.95,2493.991,"In 2019, and, this is good news that the Department will be talking about.",47,,
364,0.97,2493.991,2497.595,A total of 108 hires.,47,,
365,0.97,2497.595,2501.732,16 Laterals and Rehires.,47,,
366,0.97,2501.732,2504.869,The target had been 104.,47,,
367,0.97,2504.869,2505.97,Wait a second.,47,,
368,0.97,2505.97,2509.406,Did I get that right?,47,,
369,0.97,2509.406,2515.779,They do quite a bit better than they thought they were going to do and wound up with a net of 16 hire.,47,,
370,0.97,2515.779,2519.316,"In 2020, the goals are similar.",47,,
371,0.97,2519.316,2524.321,"And if they wind up in the same place, they will end up with 13 net new hires.",47,,
372,0.97,2524.321,2528.893,Though the reports from January are strong so it might be they wind up in a better situation there too.,47,,
373,0.97,2528.893,2534.031,"If there's not any questions like that, I will move along to the next table.",47,,
374,0.97,2534.031,2535.065,Which is fully trained officers.,47,,
375,0.97,2535.065,2538.269,I talked a little bit about fully trained officers.,47,,
376,0.97,2538.269,2538.702,That's important.,47,,
377,0.97,2538.702,2543.807,"Because, these are officers that have completed almost a Yearlong worth of training including ride along.",47,,
378,0.97,2543.807,2551.248,And now can be logged into the 911 cat system and answer 911 calls independently.,47,,
379,0.97,2551.248,2558.289,So it is at that point that you can say that you have a force Multiplier.,47,,
380,0.97,2558.289,2572.536,"I showed this chart last year and it looked basically the same with a huge dip, the department had been projecting this increase here.",47,,
381,0.97,2572.536,2576.74,"The good news is, it's happening.",47,,
382,0.97,2576.74,2582.379,Your last statement is the Department the producing they will return in the middle of 2020.,48,,
383,0.97,2582.379,2585.149,I think you are pointing to the 1316 number.,48,,
384,0.97,2585.149,2592.89,Looks like we are already there if that projection is real.,48,,
385,0.97,2592.89,2593.257,"Because, right?",48,,
386,0.97,2593.257,2596.694,"That line, looks like that's the beginning of 2020.",48,,
387,0.97,2596.694,2597.294,Where you are hitting 13.,48,,
388,0.97,2597.294,2604.201,I think that just might be an Artifact of the table.,49,,
389,0.97,2604.201,2605.135,"Right now, I think.",49,,
390,0.97,2605.135,2609.907,And that last line there.,50,,
391,0.97,2609.907,2610.608,Is that a projected number?,50,,
392,0.97,2610.608,2612.309,Is that where we are right now?,50,,
393,0.97,2612.309,2615.412,Where we are now is the 1331.,51,,
394,0.97,2615.412,2617.781,"This last line, 1378 is the projected number.",51,,
395,0.97,2617.781,2620.718,By the end of the year.,52,,
396,0.97,2620.718,2620.985,Yeah.,53,,
397,0.97,2620.985,2622.519,By the end.,53,,
398,0.97,2622.519,2624.154,Does the four mean the fourth quarter?,53,,
399,0.97,2624.154,2627.157,It just means that column is projected staffing.,54,,
400,0.97,2627.157,2627.424,Okay.,55,,
401,0.97,2627.424,2633.53,"It is a gray color here, but not showing up real well.",56,,
402,0.97,2633.53,2636.5,"So 2020, obviously, we only have one month worth of data.",56,,
403,0.97,2636.5,2642.973,That is projected.,56,,
404,0.97,2642.973,2643.34,All right.,57,,
405,0.97,2643.34,2644.008,"So, that line.",57,,
406,0.97,2644.008,2644.341,Perfect.,58,,
407,0.97,2644.341,2647.845,We will use a bar chart next time.,59,,
408,0.97,2647.845,2648.379,Councilmember Sawant?,60,,
409,0.97,2648.379,2648.746,Thank you.,61,,
410,0.97,2648.746,2654.118,"I don't know if you realize this, but separations you mean apparition.",61,,
411,0.97,2654.118,2655.252,People leaving the force?,61,,
412,0.97,2655.252,2655.886,Yes.,62,,
413,0.97,2655.886,2656.72,That is a combination.,62,,
414,0.97,2656.72,2662.893,Mostly of folks that are leaving due to retirements or resignation.,62,,
415,0.97,2662.893,2668.766,In woman instances it is where Academy cadets or folks in field training fail out.,62,,
416,0.97,2668.766,2672.069,Though those numbers are much lower than the previous two.,62,,
417,0.97,2672.069,2676.74,We don't know how many of them are retirement and how many of them are left?,63,,
418,0.97,2676.74,2679.777,We do.,64,,
419,0.97,2679.777,2681.378,Mike can talk about that.,64,,
420,0.97,2681.378,2684.815,"Sorry, I'm asking questions in advance because I have to run soon.",65,,
421,0.97,2684.815,2692.556,"If you could all while I'm here, give me a sense of what the officers were living but not at retirement.",65,,
422,0.97,2692.556,2694.892,Do we have a sense of what they do afterwards?,65,,
423,0.97,2694.892,2700.264,Like what kind of jobs they do?,65,,
424,0.97,2700.264,2700.831,I'm just curious.,65,,
425,0.97,2700.831,2701.131,Yes.,66,,
426,0.97,2701.131,2709.339,We engage in a separation survey with everyone who leaves the Department to get a sense of what they are doing.,66,,
427,0.97,2709.339,2710.04,"The reasons, et cetera.",66,,
428,0.97,2710.04,2718.148,"Perhaps a month ago, we provided the exit surveys themselves.",66,,
429,0.97,2718.148,2721.318,"And, we would be happy to provide you with anything else you would be interested in.",66,,
430,0.97,2721.318,2728.258,Could you give me some highlights?,67,,
431,0.97,2728.258,2728.525,Sure.,68,,
432,0.97,2728.525,2732.129,I don't have highlights from the survey.,68,,
433,0.97,2732.129,2733.697,We get them every month.,69,,
434,0.97,2733.697,2739.069,We get a monthly staffing report because of a previous request through the budget office.,69,,
435,0.97,2739.069,2744.141,And the monthly surveys are for that period of time.,69,,
436,0.97,2744.141,2746.477,I don't want the overall survey.,70,,
437,0.97,2746.477,2754.151,"I'm just curious about what do the officers who leave mention, what jobs do they go to?",70,,
438,0.97,2754.151,2754.551,Private security?,70,,
439,0.97,2754.551,2759.823,The majority are going to other police agencies.,71,,
440,0.97,2759.823,2762.392,Like King County.,72,,
441,0.97,2762.392,2763.327,Yes.,73,,
442,0.97,2763.327,2764.428,Other regional police agencies.,73,,
443,0.97,2764.428,2769.166,"And, of the 92 separations we had last year, 45 retired for service.",73,,
444,0.97,2769.166,2774.204,"And, really what you are talking about is the 39 resignations going elsewhere.",73,,
445,0.97,2774.204,2776.373,"And so, they are not really clustered.",73,,
446,0.97,2776.373,2779.109,They are sort of all over the Puget sound region.,73,,
447,0.97,2779.109,2786.216,Some further away for various reasons.,73,,
448,0.97,2786.216,2786.416,Yep.,73,,
449,0.97,2786.416,2786.784,Thank you.,74,,
450,0.97,2786.784,2788.952,So the next chart is patrol staffing.,75,,
451,0.97,2788.952,2795.292,"And, this is sort of where the rubber meets the road.",75,,
452,0.97,2795.292,2799.563,"As you can see in this table, there's, it's divided by precinct.",75,,
453,0.97,2799.563,2804.568,It is divided by officer and Sergeant.,75,,
454,0.97,2804.568,2805.869,Divided by job categories.,75,,
455,0.97,2805.869,2806.503,The largest one is 911.,75,,
456,0.97,2806.503,2813.477,These are folks that are logged in to cat.,75,,
457,0.97,2813.477,2813.977,And answer 911 calls.,75,,
458,0.97,2813.977,2821.351,The Anti-Crime team which is a dedicated specialty team working on specific crime problems.,75,,
459,0.97,2821.351,2824.588,Beats are a combination of foot beats and bikes.,75,,
460,0.97,2824.588,2827.658,The officers you see on the street downtown.,75,,
461,0.97,2827.658,2831.795,The community police team officers and some support personnel.,75,,
462,0.97,2831.795,2846.476,The reason I show you this is because this is where you you can see sort of the downstream effects of the 41 officers from 2014.,75,,
463,0.97,2846.476,2848.478,The number of 911 responders is relatively the same.,75,,
464,0.97,2848.478,2852.983,"At the end of last year, it was 538.",75,,
465,0.97,2852.983,2864.862,So what that says is the Department puts a priority on 911 responders and has not allowed any of the attrition to affect its 911 responders and response times.,75,,
466,0.97,2864.862,2874.171,"But your memo does identify what some of the--what we lose, right?",76,,
467,0.97,2874.171,2882.179,It is very important we put a brand on responding to calls for emergency.,76,,
468,0.97,2882.179,2883.447,But I think the memo identifies the fact.,76,,
469,0.97,2883.447,2890.754,"I was going to say, 24 others.",77,,
470,0.97,2890.754,2891.054,17 beats.,77,,
471,0.97,2891.054,2895.626,Can you give me an example?,78,,
472,0.97,2895.626,2900.497,The city is broken up geographically into precinct and there are districts within each precinct as well.,79,,
473,0.97,2900.497,2904.768,Often times an officer will be assign today a very specific geographic boundary.,79,,
474,0.97,2904.768,2909.339,"If a call comes out in that area, they are responsible for handling that first.",79,,
475,0.97,2909.339,2911.608,And then we call additional units into that area.,79,,
476,0.97,2911.608,2917.581,So you are responsible for a geographic space within each of the precincts.,79,,
477,0.97,2917.581,2921.585,You mentioned a foot beat.,80,,
478,0.97,2921.585,2922.185,Or a bike beat.,80,,
479,0.97,2922.185,2923.387,Is that different?,80,,
480,0.97,2923.387,2926.957,The same concept is we cover a certain geographic boundary.,81,,
481,0.97,2926.957,2934.331,"In some cases especially in the West precinct patrol, they may be augmented with foot beats.",81,,
482,0.97,2934.331,2934.731,Bicycle officers.,81,,
483,0.97,2934.731,2941.338,Where we can get to the most access to the 911 response for Proactive work.,81,,
484,0.97,2941.338,2941.872,It is still coverage.,81,,
485,0.97,2941.872,2944.942,So a bike officer will respond differently than a patrol car.,81,,
486,0.97,2944.942,2952.949,"I ask because this chart shows that in South precinct where I live, there prevention plan no beats so I'm looking for clarification.",82,,
487,0.97,2952.949,2958.989,"It is so spaced out, we wouldn't get maximum coverage for officers on foot patrol or a bicycle.",83,,
488,0.97,2958.989,2972.669,"And those areas just because of the distance for each of those districts, so a patrol car would be the best served way to reach people at 911 in those particular geographic areas.",83,,
489,0.97,2972.669,2979.276,That doesn't make sense to me because different precincts are all big.,84,,
490,0.97,2979.276,2984.881,It depends on the call load.,85,,
491,0.97,2984.881,3000.597,"The University district, there may be a volume of calls on University Avenue where a foot officer or bicycle officer could respond quicker than going from Rainier Beach over to parts of Columbia city.",85,,
492,0.97,3000.597,3010.44,The response would be hindered by the fact the officers couldn't get there fast enough on a bike or on a foot beat.,85,,
493,0.97,3010.44,3010.707,Okay.,86,,
494,0.97,3010.707,3030.761,"And so in addition to the impact of having through necessity to focus our officers on 911 staffing in addition to other patrol categories, there is also a potential impact on investigations and specialty units.",87,,
495,0.97,3030.761,3044.341,And I think that is important to highlight because we often hear from folks in the community that there are certain types of property crimes.,87,,
496,0.97,3044.341,3053.617,There doesn't--they don't feel from their interactions with the police Department that the police have the resource to investigate some of those lower level crimes.,87,,
497,0.97,3053.617,3062.592,"And, again, there's a rational for that and really appreciate the fact that the majority of police officer's time is really going literally from call to call.",87,,
498,0.97,3062.592,3073.804,"So, a lot of the things that chief best refer to as Holistic policing, they don't have the staff time to do that work.",87,,
499,0.97,3073.804,3085.916,One of the things I mention as long as we are on the subject of beats is that the Department has bolstered the West precinct patrol.,88,,
500,0.97,3085.916,3094.891,"And, I am looking to see if that's the case that some of the beats are being bolstered as well.",88,,
501,0.97,3094.891,3114.044,That is primarily folks precinct base support that are going to be brought into the West precinct and will augment these folks here either on overtime in the true sense of the Augmentation or redeployed there temporarily.,88,,
502,0.97,3114.044,3121.852,I think Department has said that there are about two dozen folks that are doing that on a daily basis.,88,,
503,0.97,3121.852,3135.799,"So that is the Department's effort, one of their effort to make sure downtown is receiving the kind of attention that it would deserve.",88,,
504,0.97,3135.799,3140.07,"Ccouncilmember Lewis, would it be correct to say shift instead of officers?",89,,
505,0.97,3140.07,3144.141,Those aren't reflected in those beat numbers on this chart.,89,,
506,0.97,3144.141,3145.909,"No, they are not.",90,,
507,0.97,3145.909,3154.451,So some of them come in on overtime and some of them will be deployed from other areas.,90,,
508,0.97,3154.451,3161.825,Would that also have an impact on the beat number INS the other precincts listed up here?,91,,
509,0.97,3161.825,3182.546,"So, when we have an emphasis patrol we are having down at third and pine, that is either redeployed from some patrol resources or as we are doing now, Nondeployed Resourcesfor a detective unit might one day a week go work at third and pine as part of the emphasis.",92,,
510,0.97,3182.546,3191.521,"So if they are coming in on overtime, that wouldn't necessarily result in the decrease of service from other precincts as displayed up on the chart.",93,,
511,0.97,3191.521,3194.357,Correct.,94,,
512,0.97,3194.357,3194.624,Correct.,94,,
513,0.97,3194.624,3195.892,And that's about two dozen?,95,,
514,0.97,3195.892,3200.83,It's a mix of some of the specialty units and some investigations.,96,,
515,0.97,3200.83,3205.402,"And then, some overtime and some regular time.",96,,
516,0.97,3205.402,3221.751,"And for the Southwest Precinct, could we take a minute to talk a little bit about the methodology that goes into making decisions?",97,,
517,0.97,3221.751,3226.723,"The Southwest Precinct, the number of officers is significantly lower than the other precincts.",97,,
518,0.97,3226.723,3252.415,"I know it is not just simply a function of population but there are other criteria that go into making those decisions and for the viewing public and my district, it would be helpful to have a brief explanation for why these numbers look like they do.",97,,
519,0.97,3252.415,3255.619,Half of what you see in the North precinct.,97,,
520,0.97,3255.619,3259.055,And we would be happy to bring you a break down of that.,98,,
521,0.97,3259.055,3265.362,I'm not sure if we have the people at the table to talk about the allocation.,98,,
522,0.97,3265.362,3268.264,Geography plays into response time.,98,,
523,0.97,3268.264,3281.044,Will drive the numbers but a lot of thought goes into patrol staffing and I would be happy to provide more information on that.,98,,
524,0.97,3281.044,3283.146,Thank you.,99,,
525,0.97,3283.146,3301.197,"Finally, to finish up, the chair requested me to research the question on whether police agents under a consent decree experience more difficult hiring.",100,,
526,0.97,3301.197,3315.879,"I came up empty, but found new con set decrees like the ones in New Orleans are asking police departments to track Department activity to see over time, not necessarily if the consent decree is having impact.",100,,
527,0.97,3315.879,3325.455,"I think that will be found, but also to see how recruitment activities are resulting in high quality officers and diversity.",100,,
528,0.97,3325.455,3325.722,Yeah.,101,,
529,0.97,3325.722,3328.892,I asked Greg to look into this issue.,101,,
530,0.97,3328.892,3334.964,"Because, we hear a lot about police morale.",101,,
531,0.97,3334.964,3346.443,"And, the impact of morale on recruitment and retention and was interested to see whether or not there could be Nikau station with the fact that we have been under consent decree since 2012.",101,,
532,0.97,3346.443,3354.017,We may not have been able to identify data that shows a relationship there.,101,,
533,0.97,3354.017,3365.228,But there is apparently a new requirement to track this very issue in future consent decrees means I believe is confirmation that we should look at it.,101,,
534,0.97,3365.228,3367.397,This may be part of my next presentation.,102,,
535,0.97,3367.397,3373.47,So let me know if it is not.,102,,
536,0.97,3373.47,3376.139,We have the number of folks we put into new positions.,102,,
537,0.97,3376.139,3384.414,Do we have a number on how many applicants we have received and how many people were accepting and how many people we are turning away?,102,,
538,0.97,3384.414,3386.95,Yes we do and happy to provide that as well.,103,,
539,0.97,3386.95,3388.385,A lot of someday tactic.,103,,
540,0.97,3388.385,3389.919,A lot of falloff points.,103,,
541,0.97,3389.919,3392.455,A number of applicants versus the people who sit for a test.,103,,
542,0.97,3392.455,3394.624,The number of people that pass the written.,103,,
543,0.97,3394.624,3398.762,Pass the oral and the background.,103,,
544,0.97,3398.762,3399.129,The Polygraph.,103,,
545,0.97,3399.129,3402.165,Would be happy to provide you the fallout rate at each step.,103,,
546,0.97,3402.165,3407.604,But that would be best presented in a table.,103,,
547,0.97,3407.604,3412.008,"And do you know, are we get ago high number of applicants?",104,,
548,0.97,3412.008,3414.411,A low number of applicants?,104,,
549,0.97,3414.411,3422.452,2018 was historically low number which drove the 68 folks we hired.,105,,
550,0.97,3422.452,3423.019,2019 up ticked some.,105,,
551,0.97,3423.019,3426.322,"We are still down from the 2015, 16 applicant rates.",105,,
552,0.97,3426.322,3428.425,"Greg, you have the test numbers for 2018?",106,,
553,0.97,3428.425,3438.168,The number of folks that sat for the test and I got this from Mike several months ago was 837.,107,,
554,0.97,3438.168,3447.31,"If you go back to the higher numbers in 2016, the number was 1,204.",107,,
555,0.97,3447.31,3450.88,Those are new recruits.,107,,
556,0.97,3450.88,3451.714,Thank you.,108,,
557,0.97,3451.714,3452.916,All right.,108,,
558,0.97,3452.916,3455.351,So should we move?,108,,
559,0.97,3455.351,3455.652,Fantastic.,108,,
560,0.97,3455.652,3460.223,Thank you.,108,,
561,0.97,3460.223,3465.762,Just going to move.,109,,
562,0.97,3465.762,3475.138,Thank you so much.,110,,
563,0.97,3475.138,3483.58,Thanks Greg and thank you Councilmembers for the opportunity to present on our hiring last year and how we are going to move into next year.,111,,
564,0.97,3483.58,3485.949,Let's see if I can do this.,111,,
565,0.97,3485.949,3486.249,Here we go.,111,,
566,0.97,3486.249,3495.091,"So, today, we will be Recapping 2019's recruitment efforts and results in describing the plan for 2020.",111,,
567,0.97,3495.091,3505.802,"As we continue to compete for officers, as it is nationwide, the market remains tight.",111,,
568,0.97,3505.802,3514.344,"With historically low unemployment and jurisdictions competing for the applicants, this is a nationwide challenge.",111,,
569,0.97,3514.344,3539.402,"So, what we did in 2019, based on feedback from the community, in 2019, we made adjustments to our recruiting materials including more prominently featuring our officers of color and recruitment materials and expanding our presence in minority owned publications Includeing the samples we see on the side including the Northwest Asian weekly and the African-American business directory among others.",111,,
570,0.97,3539.402,3543.806,"Mike, are you only doing print media or Online media?",112,,
571,0.97,3543.806,3547.343,Thank you for the question.,113,,
572,0.97,3547.343,3553.85,We have multiple Online channels through some of the nationwide stuff.,113,,
573,0.97,3553.85,3556.119,"Linkedin, et cetera.",113,,
574,0.97,3556.119,3562.659,"We push out content across our internal Facebook, Instagram.",113,,
575,0.97,3562.659,3567.463,We do some targeted placements and police specific recruiting sites like police one.,113,,
576,0.97,3567.463,3567.797,Fantastic.,114,,
577,0.97,3567.797,3581.377,I'm focused more on the question as it relates to print versus Online as it relates to the news publications.,114,,
578,0.97,3581.377,3596.392,"Those are all, these are all publications that I know are, have print versions but there are a lot of news Blogs that are geographically focused in neighborhoods with ethnic focuses that are only in Blog format.",114,,
579,0.97,3596.392,3598.761,So I'm wondering whether or not you are advertising on those too.,114,,
580,0.97,3598.761,3601.297,I'm not sure that we are utilizing any of those.,115,,
581,0.97,3601.297,3612.542,So one of the things we did when we first came to the unit was meet with the Mayor's office and find out about all of the minority and ethnic papers and organizations in the city of Seattle.,116,,
582,0.97,3612.542,3619.048,It was very important to us that money went back into our own community and we were advertising through the best community options that we had.,116,,
583,0.97,3619.048,3626.022,"So every year, we have looked for additional opportunities so connect whether it be Online.",116,,
584,0.97,3626.022,3626.389,Print media.,116,,
585,0.97,3626.389,3633.463,"Some have been relationships with 15 or 20 years, the media comes to mind right now.",116,,
586,0.97,3633.463,3635.565,"And, Chris Bennett radio and things like that.",116,,
587,0.97,3635.565,3639.102,We are always seeking additional opportunities.,116,,
588,0.97,3639.102,3648.177,We assess them and make sure we have an ad representative of the organization that is sharing in our information.,116,,
589,0.97,3648.177,3648.644,Thank you.,117,,
590,0.97,3648.644,3650.947,The next one is you.,118,,
591,0.97,3650.947,3652.348,"We were busy, last year.",119,,
592,0.97,3652.348,3654.384,This is actually a fairly typical year.,119,,
593,0.97,3654.384,3658.187,There are two of us assigned to the recruiting function.,119,,
594,0.97,3658.187,3666.896,"However, we have a recruiting support team of around 50 officers who have indicated Úthat they have an interest in assisting with recruiting events.",119,,
595,0.97,3666.896,3667.764,Especially in particular communities.,119,,
596,0.97,3667.764,3677.874,We do our best to try to bring recruiting support members with us to communities and events they have an interest in representing the Department at.,119,,
597,0.97,3677.874,3681.377,"And so, we have also been lucky enough.",119,,
598,0.97,3681.377,3688.718,"We get invitations for high schools, for colleges, essentially, if you call us and you ask, we will be there.",119,,
599,0.97,3688.718,3693.256,We recently did a know your rights day at South Seattle college too.,119,,
600,0.97,3693.256,3708.071,It is not always about recruiting but about community engagement and that is important to us because we definitely find that the community engagement yields much broader candidates that weren't considering a job other than a career fair.,119,,
601,0.97,3708.071,3712.241,"We constantly seek additional opportunities, and the thing we are proud of is the workshops we offer.",119,,
602,0.97,3712.241,3724.787,"Whether a candidate is ready to test or not, we offer free workshops.",119,,
603,0.97,3724.787,3727.323,We have 456 attendees.,119,,
604,0.97,3727.323,3729.892,We tell you everything.,120,,
605,0.97,3729.892,3731.961,There is nothing secret about our process.,120,,
606,0.97,3731.961,3738.701,We want them to feel confident and tested and we give them all the opportunities to do that.,120,,
607,0.97,3738.701,3745.608,"And, we are their lifeline and we are that White glove service to help them through the testing process.",120,,
608,0.97,3745.608,3753.449,Do you have Metrics that track how well people who take your workshops do on the test versus folks who do not?,121,,
609,0.97,3753.449,3754.016,We do.,122,,
610,0.97,3754.016,3761.09,And it is very clear statistically that those who attend workshops do significantly better than those that do not.,122,,
611,0.97,3761.09,3764.927,You don't have to sign up for the test or be ready.,122,,
612,0.97,3764.927,3771.567,We want you to take the workshop and that will help you assess when it is time to take the exam.,122,,
613,0.97,3771.567,3777.673,"Whether it is three months, six months, or a year from now, we will give you all the information to help you.",122,,
614,0.97,3777.673,3790.019,"And just generally speaking, do you have a way of, I mean, last year was a good year.",123,,
615,0.97,3790.019,3791.287,2019.,123,,
616,0.97,3791.287,3804.133,What you were doing works . We track the outcomes associated with these events?,123,,
617,0.97,3804.133,3804.901,There's two of us.,124,,
618,0.97,3804.901,3810.206,We know who it is that we have met.,124,,
619,0.97,3810.206,3812.275,We were at a career fair.,124,,
620,0.97,3812.275,3817.013,We met her four years ago at that career fair and she is graduating now and ready to test.,124,,
621,0.97,3817.013,3822.618,"So, we know that we have the relationships that last for years.",124,,
622,0.97,3822.618,3827.19,Especially if they are youth that can't apply until 21.,124,,
623,0.97,3827.19,3830.293,"We work with those people for many, many years.",124,,
624,0.97,3830.293,3832.895,"Overwhelmingly, again, I go back to the community events.",124,,
625,0.97,3832.895,3834.497,They are very good for us.,124,,
626,0.97,3834.497,3838.301,But often it takes that candidate a little longer to prepare to test.,124,,
627,0.97,3838.301,3840.303,"Because, again, they weren't looking for a job.",124,,
628,0.97,3840.303,3848.077,They had an opportunity to talk to an officer that it sparked something like I didn't know there wasn't an age limit or what the process looked like.,124,,
629,0.97,3848.077,3859.255,So us being able to assist them with that information but I do think it take that's candidate perhaps a little longer than someone at a career fair instantly looking for a job for example.,124,,
630,0.97,3859.255,3861.824,Thank you.,125,,
631,0.97,3861.824,3875.771,"If I could just add, coups, on the front end when folks apply, ask them questions about how did you hear about us.",126,,
632,0.97,3875.771,3876.172,Thank you.,127,,
633,0.97,3876.172,3883.045,I have a couple of questions about recruitment.,127,,
634,0.97,3883.045,3887.55,One is around language preference points.,127,,
635,0.97,3887.55,3890.887,"We have heard Anecdotally, there might be a change in that criteria.",127,,
636,0.97,3890.887,3897.86,What we are getting are people who are speaking languages that are not necessarily reflected in our most diverse communities.,127,,
637,0.97,3897.86,3906.168,Maybe European languages rather than East African for example so I have a question about that.,127,,
638,0.97,3906.168,3926.255,"The other question I have is, given our desire to shift toward restorative justice and you know, more diversion programs, seems that finding candidates that are eager to learn those trauma informed approaches, and restorative justice practices could help change the narrative.",127,,
639,0.97,3926.255,3927.023,Especially in my district.,127,,
640,0.97,3927.023,3931.861,The communities I'm representing in terms of how we interact with folks impacted in the criminal legal system.,127,,
641,0.97,3931.861,3945.007,"And so, I'm wondering if there is any consideration given to a recruit's Almostness or eagerness to learn about those kinds of practices.",127,,
642,0.97,3945.007,3952.882,If there is any criteria included in the scoring of the application processes there.,127,,
643,0.97,3952.882,3956.018,First to the language preference.,128,,
644,0.97,3956.018,3959.956,"In 2019, we had four folks take advantage of the language preference.",128,,
645,0.97,3959.956,3964.293,"They were Russian, German, French, and Spanish were the languages utilized.",128,,
646,0.97,3964.293,3976.839,"And in terms of your second point, we really go pout of our way describing what it means to be a police officer in Seattle.",128,,
647,0.97,3976.839,3983.779,"And, giving a realistic view of what that looks like and the majority of your engagements will be at the center of public health and safety.",128,,
648,0.97,3983.779,3991.053,"And that we do put a big emphasis on crisis informed Anti-Bias, Deescalation.",128,,
649,0.97,3991.053,3996.992,And just so that people know what the Seattle approach is.,128,,
650,0.97,3996.992,4001.097,"And then in our interview, there are questions that draw that out.",128,,
651,0.97,4001.097,4002.498,And it is an important factor.,128,,
652,0.97,4002.498,4004.7,"And, sorry, just going back to the language.",129,,
653,0.97,4004.7,4005.034,Thank you.,129,,
654,0.97,4005.034,4011.741,"Going back to the language issue then, if we, are there particular recruitment efforts happening?",129,,
655,0.97,4011.741,4014.143,I saw the event you did yesterday.,129,,
656,0.97,4014.143,4014.577,And the Cid.,129,,
657,0.97,4014.577,4024.553,"But, none of the languages you mentioned are languages that are highly reflected in our community.",129,,
658,0.97,4024.553,4027.89,"Particularly for communities that have, that are most impacted by the legal system.",129,,
659,0.97,4027.89,4041.971,Is there an effort to target or focus on folks who speak Vietnamese?,129,,
660,0.97,4041.971,4045.408,It goes back to the same thing.,130,,
661,0.97,4045.408,4054.35,We never invite ourselves into a community.,130,,
662,0.97,4054.35,4061.757,"We ask our officers, if you know about a cultural event and a community event coming up, we would be able to come and talk about this job and please do that.",130,,
663,0.97,4061.757,4068.33,They will make the introduction and we have that ongoing relationship.,130,,
664,0.97,4068.33,4070.032,That's what the important piece of that is.,130,,
665,0.97,4070.032,4072.268,The language is offered to every candidate taking the test.,130,,
666,0.97,4072.268,4077.673,When you list in the job application what the process is for getting those language preference points.,130,,
667,0.97,4077.673,4079.875,"So, that is Self-Selected in a lot of cases.",130,,
668,0.97,4079.875,4081.143,"And, Tha is in that job.",130,,
669,0.97,4081.143,4085.815,And so I know we can work on a better way to make sure that is highlighted.,130,,
670,0.97,4085.815,4091.187,It is featured prominently on our Website that there are language preference points.,130,,
671,0.97,4091.187,4093.856,It is offered in depth in the testing process.,130,,
672,0.97,4093.856,4100.196,"Like, when we put out the application, it describes exactly that we offer the preference points.",130,,
673,0.97,4100.196,4107.57,"And so, we could certainly look at doing a better job of Maybing sure the candidate understands that the preference points are available to them.",130,,
674,0.97,4107.57,4113.142,So just to clarify.,131,,
675,0.97,4113.142,4116.479,I do agree with Councilmember Morales that is language is an important part of the hiring.,131,,
676,0.97,4116.479,4120.549,As someone who was a Prosecutor before going here.,131,,
677,0.97,4120.549,4127.89,And there would be the police report and the person started speaking Vietnamese and they were flat footed in the investigation a little bit.,131,,
678,0.97,4127.89,4141.37,"Just to clarify, when, makings when you mentioned the languages earlier that were Russian, German, French, and Spanish, those were the languages the applicants listed.",131,,
679,0.97,4141.37,4142.137,Those are not the only --,131,,
680,0.97,4142.137,4149.645,Those were the four candidates that asked for the language preference points and tested in those languages.,132,,
681,0.97,4149.645,4152.148,But anyone who speaks a language can put that on.,133,,
682,0.97,4152.148,4152.381,Yes.,134,,
683,0.97,4152.381,4161.924,"It was just out of all the times we offered that on the applications, there were only four people that took advantage of those preference points.",134,,
684,0.97,4161.924,4167.93,"And, those were the languages spoken so that is reflective of the four people that took advantage of that preference point.",134,,
685,0.97,4167.93,4171.5,Andly make one more point about that.,135,,
686,0.97,4171.5,4176.539,The point after having this is to draw folks in from communities of color.,135,,
687,0.97,4176.539,4182.378,"So if it doesn't sound like we are getting those folks in, it is great they were able to take advantage of it.",135,,
688,0.97,4182.378,4188.017,But the real point of this is to try to achieve racial equity in the police Department.,135,,
689,0.97,4188.017,4189.451,Sounds like we have some work to do.,135,,
690,0.97,4189.451,4192.821,"Greg, can you speak a little bit?",136,,
691,0.97,4192.821,4207.303,Because Greg was really instrumental to developing the language preference points policy.,136,,
692,0.97,4207.303,4209.371,The 2017 Accountordinance requires.,136,,
693,0.97,4209.371,4237.9,"I remember there being some conversation about whether or not to focus on whether or not the individual has a second language at all versus focusing on the five stop second languages spoken by Seattle residents so that people wouldn't get preference points for any language, but they would get preference points if they represented what the language needs or the community.",136,,
694,0.97,4237.9,4239.034,Do you recall that conversation?,136,,
695,0.97,4239.034,4244.206,It may be that it is tied up in some legal analysis we had done.,137,,
696,0.97,4244.206,4250.646,"So, I would want to get back to you on that.",137,,
697,0.97,4250.646,4272.101,"I think the point Councilmember Morales is making, is even though, we have been told preference points are not making or breaking whether or not we are hiring people that represent the communities, I think there is an important message that preference points presence points sends to the communities we are trying to recruit from.",138,,
698,0.97,4272.101,4293.155,"So, if we are specifically saying to the Smallly community, we will give you extra points if you speak this language, that will affect the number of number who actually show any interest in being police officers so there's another, I think another utility for preference points.",138,,
699,0.97,4293.155,4311.306,"As long as we are talking about the subject of preference points, the accountability legislation not only identified language preference points, but, we also identified preference points related to people's experience working in communities such as experience working with the peace Corp.",138,,
700,0.97,4311.306,4312.808,Other kinds of social work.,138,,
701,0.97,4312.808,4325.921,That part of the policy has not yet been developed but I know folks both with the CPC and the Mayor's office and SPD are hard at work at doing that as well.,138,,
702,0.97,4325.921,4330.392,Intended to be not just ensuring that who we are hiring is reflecting our community.,138,,
703,0.97,4330.392,4349.111,"But also, intending to help you do more recruitment within those communities by us Broadcasting our interest in people who have sort of certain skill sets and Competencies.",138,,
704,0.97,4349.111,4349.378,Okay.,139,,
705,0.97,4349.378,4353.515,I'll cover this a little bit.,140,,
706,0.97,4353.515,4367.262,"As a 3-Year veteran of the Department, a 30 year veteran of the Department, it has been my goal to increase the number of women we have in our Orization and highlight public safety as a career for women.",140,,
707,0.97,4367.262,4368.297,We continue to focus.,140,,
708,0.97,4368.297,4377.039,"A do a lot of collaboration with other entities who also have a lack of female representation, especially in stem organization.",140,,
709,0.97,4377.039,4381.276,"There is not always a lot of public safety, women's events focused specifically.",140,,
710,0.97,4381.276,4388.884,But we find that we want to partner up with organizations with a woman focus on their career opportunities.,140,,
711,0.97,4388.884,4404.199,"In the last Year-And-A-Half, I had an opportunity to be invited and speak at three different recruiting and retention conferences and specifically, I'm asked to come talk about what we are doing around women and persons of color so I'm very proud of what we are doing.",140,,
712,0.97,4404.199,4409.004,It is getting a lot of Kudos across the country.,140,,
713,0.97,4409.004,4411.707,I continue to be invited to speak.,140,,
714,0.97,4411.707,4415.611,I'm speaking at two conferences in April and June.,140,,
715,0.97,4415.611,4425.02,"And, specifically, I'm running a woman in public safety track at one of the conferences and I was invited to start that last year and we are doing that again this year.",140,,
716,0.97,4425.02,4431.26,"So, globally, not only locally, we feel like we have an emphasis on boosting women in public safety and law enforcement.",140,,
717,0.97,4431.26,4445.808,"So, we are always reaching out for additional opportunities to meet with women, especially young women to see themselves in this career down the road.",140,,
718,0.97,4445.808,4446.909,And correct misconceptions as well.,140,,
719,0.97,4446.909,4447.176,Okay.,141,,
720,0.97,4447.176,4451.413,And I will just talk a little bit about hiring results for last year.,141,,
721,0.97,4451.413,4457.386,Last year was the best year in hiring in over a decade in terms of numbers.,141,,
722,0.97,4457.386,4460.022,We hired 108 officers including 92 entry level.,141,,
723,0.97,4460.022,4460.322,14 Lateral.,141,,
724,0.97,4460.322,4463.826,And two officers who left SPD and chose to return.,141,,
725,0.97,4463.826,4473.502,"I would point out, there are six others who have either returned in 2020 or are in the process of returning to SPD.",141,,
726,0.97,4473.502,4484.98,"In terms of separations, the department had 92 total separations Includeing the 45 retirements, resignations and others who left for other reasons.",141,,
727,0.97,4484.98,4488.217,We were plus 16 for the year.,141,,
728,0.97,4488.217,4498.06,"On the Lateral hires, I know last year, the Department made a number of out of state trips focused on Lateral hires.",142,,
729,0.97,4498.06,4504.199,Wondering if that will be occurring again this year.,142,,
730,0.97,4504.199,4506.001,The focus on Lateral hires is an important one.,142,,
731,0.97,4506.001,4511.473,Those are folks who are not going to need the extensive training.,142,,
732,0.97,4511.473,4523.218,"Some ways though their hiring bonus is a little higher than new hires, it is a cost effective quicker way to get more officers into the Department.",142,,
733,0.97,4523.218,4523.585,Absolutely.,143,,
734,0.97,4523.585,4528.69,The Lateral Academy is two weeks as opposed to four months for entry level.,143,,
735,0.97,4528.69,4532.661,Field training is also abbreviated.,143,,
736,0.97,4532.661,4540.402,We found we were having more success with our home grown Lateral efforts so that's not on the agenda for 2020.,143,,
737,0.97,4540.402,4546.575,We had a Lateral test last weekend.,143,,
738,0.97,4546.575,4548.243,"And, the numbers were good.",143,,
739,0.97,4548.243,4550.312,That's a promising sign.,143,,
740,0.97,4550.312,4553.015,"I just, throwing an idea out.",144,,
741,0.97,4553.015,4570.599,"You guys know what works, but, perhaps, doing some of that out of state work focused on women might be the way to go and you might find that produces additional result to the gains you accomplish this year.",144,,
742,0.97,4570.599,4585.547,"I might add the bonus, the 15,000 for Lateral hires and the 7500 for recruits, hopefully, that played a part in the 92 entry level folks and the Laterals they got last year.",145,,
743,0.97,4585.547,4588.417,The Department is doing some work to evaluate that.,145,,
744,0.97,4588.417,4591.019,And that bonus will sunset this year about mid year.,145,,
745,0.97,4591.019,4597.259,"And so, the Department will come back with a report that recommends to the Council whether or not they should extend that.",145,,
746,0.97,4597.259,4598.193,Thank you.,146,,
747,0.97,4598.193,4604.6,We will be trying to ferret out the causal relationship between the bonus and the numbers.,147,,
748,0.97,4604.6,4608.003,It's hard to Untangle the reasons people choose to take a job.,147,,
749,0.97,4608.003,4618.28,I think we have some good surveying out that will help with that and we will be circling back as Greg said with a report on that.,147,,
750,0.97,4618.28,4625.487,"So, this slide gives us a five year Retro Spective on hiring demographics.",148,,
751,0.97,4625.487,4633.462,"The reason the total hires numbers are not the same at both tables is if an applicant didn't indicate race, they weren't included in the racial data counts.",148,,
752,0.97,4633.462,4639.635,"As you can see, the recruitment of women continues to be a challenge.",148,,
753,0.97,4639.635,4640.202,As it is nationally.,148,,
754,0.97,4640.202,4656.251,The hiring of people of color has continued an upward trend where the incoming trends were the most diverse in Department history with 35% identifying as people of color.,148,,
755,0.97,4656.251,4667.896,"It is interesting in 2018, though the total hire numbers were down, the numbers for women hired, the percentage is up.",149,,
756,0.97,4667.896,4670.399,Any reflections on why that might be?,149,,
757,0.97,4670.399,4679.074,"It is hard to, it is hard to draw those causal connections.",150,,
758,0.97,4679.074,4688.55,"Some time with the Smalling numbers, the percentages can Skew.",150,,
759,0.97,4688.55,4688.884,All right.,151,,
760,0.97,4688.884,4697.926,"Okay, so in terms of what we are doing in 2020 on the retention side of the equation, several initiatives are aimed at employee wellness and engagement.",152,,
761,0.97,4697.926,4698.393,This is important.,152,,
762,0.97,4698.393,4704.466,"If you hire 100 officers and 100 leave, obviously, you are at net zero.",152,,
763,0.97,4704.466,4706.201,So the retention piece is important.,152,,
764,0.97,4706.201,4714.71,The example of this is the newly created SPD wellness unit which will be rolling out a variety of offerings aimed at the unique wellness needs of police officers.,152,,
765,0.97,4714.71,4728.724,We will also be working to streamline the hiring process and have a more friendly applicant process and state the highest paid in the state.,152,,
766,0.97,4728.724,4731.693,Having unique opportunities to work in specialty units.,152,,
767,0.97,4731.693,4735.864,"State of the art training and up to a $15,000 hiring incentive.",152,,
768,0.97,4735.864,4738.033,"And then, we mentioned the language preference points.",152,,
769,0.97,4738.033,4741.837,We will continue to be administering those.,152,,
770,0.97,4741.837,4743.905,Fully agree we need to get those right out in front.,152,,
771,0.97,4743.905,4754.85,"Because, they cannot only have an effect on the back end with regard to where you sit on the register, but it is Messaging from the Department that historically Underrepresented groups are welcome.",152,,
772,0.97,4754.85,4756.651,"So, can have a benefit on the front end.",152,,
773,0.97,4756.651,4769.698,"And then, with regard to the community service, preference points, we are Partnering with others to make that happen.",152,,
774,0.97,4769.698,4778.473,We have a meeting March 3 to continue that work.,152,,
775,0.97,4778.473,4783.378,So this slide talks about the community focused advertising we will be rolling out as of yesterday.,153,,
776,0.97,4783.378,4789.684,This effort will involve a series of billboards featuring a different officer each month.,153,,
777,0.97,4789.684,4800.462,Accompanied by a Video vignette featuring that same officer talking about why policing in Seattle and a particular neighborhood is important to them.,153,,
778,0.97,4800.462,4802.697,This will run parallel with their other pieces.,153,,
779,0.97,4802.697,4812.674,The Video itself will be featured on a recruiting Website and pushed out across the other Online channels that we mentioned.,153,,
780,0.97,4812.674,4829.491,"Ingly thought I remember seeing in the media coverage of yesterday's event, that this effort wasn't part of the Council's funding.",153,,
781,0.97,4829.491,4832.727,I see this tied into the recruitment.,153,,
782,0.97,4832.727,4836.565,These folks are recruitment ambassadors.,153,,
783,0.97,4836.565,4838.7,And that is part of the plan we helped Fund.,153,,
784,0.97,4838.7,4841.002,We see it as part and parcel.,154,,
785,0.97,4841.002,4844.773,We may not have a line item for billboards but this is what we intended to support.,155,,
786,0.97,4844.773,4850.412,"As you know, the line items were pretty general.",156,,
787,0.97,4850.412,4857.118,"So yes, this is part of that effort.",156,,
788,0.97,4857.118,4865.327,Thank you.,157,,
789,0.97,4865.327,4868.129,We will continue to focus on the highlight women.,158,,
790,0.97,4868.129,4870.565,We have several events that are coming up.,158,,
791,0.97,4870.565,4873.235,We participate in young women empowered.,158,,
792,0.97,4873.235,4881.81,I work with Transitioning female service members.,158,,
793,0.97,4881.81,4884.412,I see something on linked in.,158,,
794,0.97,4884.412,4888.85,We find great collaboration through those kinds of partnerships.,158,,
795,0.97,4888.85,4897.125,"And, again, these are long ongoing relationships that we have, I'm 100% believer in the pipeline.",158,,
796,0.97,4897.125,4899.694,We think it is difficult for hiring across the country.,158,,
797,0.97,4899.694,4902.13,And in five or ten years it will be considerably worse.,158,,
798,0.97,4902.13,4910.805,"That is a great opportunity I have to work with agencies across the country on best practices and also making sure that we are doing things, maybe no one SELLS doing.",158,,
799,0.97,4910.805,4916.144,So I like leading the way up here in the Northwest.,158,,
800,0.97,4916.144,4916.745,Great.,159,,
801,0.97,4916.745,4925.62,"So, in terms of additional strategies we will be pursuing in 2020, they include implementing an electronic case management solution for our background process.",159,,
802,0.97,4925.62,4928.223,Sort of a back of the House issue.,159,,
803,0.97,4928.223,4929.257,"But, it is important.",159,,
804,0.97,4929.257,4933.561,Because we need to move people from date of testing to date of hire as quickly as possible.,159,,
805,0.97,4933.561,4939.434,So we are not losing folks to other jurisdiction.,159,,
806,0.97,4939.434,4948.877,We will also be running a supplemental Academy class in the end of March through a partnership with King and Snohomish counties.,159,,
807,0.97,4948.877,4950.412,Currently we have five Academy classes.,159,,
808,0.97,4950.412,4952.847,It is the March class allowing us to add to that.,159,,
809,0.97,4952.847,4960.055,And I want to highlight this.,160,,
810,0.97,4960.055,4983.645,This issue of us hearing from the state Academy that they could not take more recruits is something that would come up year after year after year on why Seattle couldn't do more when hiring was good.,160,,
811,0.97,4983.645,4992.42,So I appreciate everyone getting involved with the other jurisdictions on finding a way forward with the class size issue and not taking no for an answer.,160,,
812,0.97,4992.42,4994.289,I think it is really important.,160,,
813,0.97,4994.289,5002.497,And I think there are gains that we are going to be able to realize from that in future years as well.,160,,
814,0.97,5002.497,5007.402,"And Lastly, building clear pathways for our civilian employees.",161,,
815,0.97,5007.402,5009.437,Parking enforcement officers.,161,,
816,0.97,5009.437,5013.375,911 Dispatchers who might want to consider a career.,161,,
817,0.97,5013.375,5022.717,Is there funding in the budget that is sufficient for the supplemental Academy or where there be additional need for funding?,162,,
818,0.97,5022.717,5025.887,There will not be need for additional funding.,163,,
819,0.97,5025.887,5029.024,"And, can you state what the civilian to sworn Pathway is?",164,,
820,0.97,5029.024,5032.994,Is that the general term for what we are talking about or is that something specific?,164,,
821,0.97,5032.994,5046.007,"That is going to be a specific effort as opposed to just posting, actually do some outreach to our employees who already know the city.",165,,
822,0.97,5046.007,5058.987,"Already are well equipped on radio, have already been Backgrounded, et cetera, to actively solicit folks who might want to participate in the sworn Hairing process.",165,,
823,0.97,5058.987,5060.955,Thank you.,166,,
824,0.97,5060.955,5061.222,Okay.,167,,
825,0.97,5061.222,5066.261,"In terms of work in progress, this slide describes some of the other things we will be working on this year.",167,,
826,0.97,5066.261,5071.599,Some of which came out of our collaboration with the innovation team last year.,167,,
827,0.97,5071.599,5083.545,"And distinct from path ways for current employees to sworn, we are also looking at youth pathways to employment.",167,,
828,0.97,5083.545,5096.724,That goes to McNally's reference of building a pipeline where people who never realized being an officer.,167,,
829,0.97,5096.724,5103.465,We have 50 folks who have volunteered to go back to their communities and connect and engage in recruitment activities.,167,,
830,0.97,5103.465,5110.238,"Lastly, as folks are moving through our process, increasing the frequency of communication with applicants to make sure they stay engaged.",167,,
831,0.97,5110.238,5120.281,That last item is the item that I think was referred to in the recruitment and retention plan is the leave no Candidae behind.,168,,
832,0.97,5120.281,5120.515,Right?,168,,
833,0.97,5120.515,5122.917,Just that follow up with folks who apply?,168,,
834,0.97,5122.917,5123.518,That is correct.,169,,
835,0.97,5123.518,5130.358,We have a lot of applicants.,169,,
836,0.97,5130.358,5137.332,"So, we need some automation to ensure we have a high touch approach.",169,,
837,0.97,5137.332,5142.637,Having that high touch approach.,169,,
838,0.97,5142.637,5156.951,"And, then, I often ask about whether or not it would make sense for seat toll have a cadet program and people remind me, we have an explorer program but I don't see the explorer program as a cadet program.",170,,
839,0.97,5156.951,5165.159,"It seems like the age that the explorer program serves, there need to be something in between.",170,,
840,0.97,5165.159,5169.731,"That program ending and an appropriate time to apply to be a police officer, there seem to be a bridge missing there.",170,,
841,0.97,5169.731,5173.601,And is that something that we think about at all?,170,,
842,0.97,5173.601,5182.277,"So, one of the things we have done in the last few months in particular, with work closely with our collaborative policing community.",171,,
843,0.97,5182.277,5183.878,There is so much overlap.,171,,
844,0.97,5183.878,5186.514,Many of the officers assist us with recruiting.,171,,
845,0.97,5186.514,5191.085,We go to events that are community based as well.,171,,
846,0.97,5191.085,5193.855,One of those areas is our explorer.,171,,
847,0.97,5193.855,5197.425,We have the most diverse in the state.,171,,
848,0.97,5197.425,5205.533,Bought we do find that not all of those applicants have an intention of being in law ensuring Forcement or choose to stay with us.,171,,
849,0.97,5205.533,5216.277,"This is something we are putting a lot more effort into, making sure the Explorerring we have seek clearer opportunities to stay with us.",171,,
850,0.97,5216.277,5224.619,"But, we are also looking at how we bring more students in with a focus on becoming a law enforcement officer down the road.",171,,
851,0.97,5224.619,5225.587,We are creating literature.,171,,
852,0.97,5225.587,5235.296,Adding that to our recruiting materials as we go to high schools and different trade schools across the area.,171,,
853,0.97,5235.296,5235.53,Tones.,171,,
854,0.97,5235.53,5240.435,We are looking at how we could potentially offer college credit.,171,,
855,0.97,5240.435,5244.172,If we have explorers involved in a college program.,171,,
856,0.97,5244.172,5246.708,A criminal justice particular.,171,,
857,0.97,5246.708,5257.051,If we could work with those universities to offer the path of explorer as a credit.,171,,
858,0.97,5257.051,5261.889,We are looking at how we can get more Internships.,171,,
859,0.97,5261.889,5273.901,Some of our explorers could be excellent to our community outreach if we can find an opportunity to build an Internship program over and above what the city is offering to the 200 plus with the focus on the Department.,171,,
860,0.97,5273.901,5278.673,"So, these are all areas we are exploring with our project manager.",171,,
861,0.97,5278.673,5281.209,With hr and with the explorer cadre in particular.,171,,
862,0.97,5281.209,5282.61,I'm glad to hear that.,172,,
863,0.97,5282.61,5295.556,I think figuring out a way to formalize the relationship post might bear some fruit.,172,,
864,0.97,5295.556,5295.857,Thank you.,172,,
865,0.97,5295.857,5296.557,Okay.,173,,
866,0.97,5296.557,5308.703,"So, in closing, I thought we would share an example of a Video vignette we will be rolling out in 2020.",173,,
867,0.97,5308.703,5308.97,Oh!,174,,
868,0.97,5308.97,5318.913,Do you want a sticker?,174,,
869,0.97,5355.183,5358.152,"Oh, do you want a sticker?",175,,
870,0.97,5358.152,5360.655,I have been working for about two years now.,176,,
871,0.97,5360.655,5362.323,I am out of the West precinct.,176,,
872,0.97,5362.323,5364.158,I didn't think I would be a police officer from day one.,176,,
873,0.97,5364.158,5367.528,"But since I have been on the job, I felt like I found my place.",176,,
874,0.97,5367.528,5369.964,I like the challenge aspect of I.,176,,
875,0.97,5369.964,5373.768,Kind of being that problem Solver.,176,,
876,0.97,5373.768,5375.57,Assisting someone in their most critical time.,176,,
877,0.97,5375.57,5377.438,There isn't a mold to be a police officer.,176,,
878,0.97,5377.438,5379.874,"You don't have to be a certain size, have a certain mentality.",176,,
879,0.97,5379.874,5388.583,"I think it is a job you want to do and you want to help people, I would say apply.",176,,
880,0.97,5388.583,5395.39,To SPD from career in retail.,177,,
881,0.97,5395.39,5396.057,Yep.,178,,
882,0.97,5396.057,5397.391,Councilmember Pederson?,179,,
883,0.97,5397.391,5399.293,Thank you.,180,,
884,0.97,5399.293,5410.772,"So, congratulations on your hiring progress in 2019.",180,,
885,0.97,5410.772,5413.174,In terms of the recruits.,180,,
886,0.97,5413.174,5417.912,I want to thank Councilmember Herbold in getting additional recruitment efforts off the ground.,180,,
887,0.97,5417.912,5424.852,I am concerned about the retaining of our experienced officers.,180,,
888,0.97,5424.852,5427.321,The net numbers are still low.,180,,
889,0.97,5427.321,5435.563,Just want to Harken back to the 2016 Berkshire study which said we needed to hire 175 more officers.,180,,
890,0.97,5435.563,5437.932,And that was back in 2016.,180,,
891,0.97,5437.932,5443.571,Our city is obviously continuing to grow.,180,,
892,0.97,5443.571,5447.542,"Our police force ended in 2014, 1,330 police officers.",180,,
893,0.97,5447.542,5453.548,"Five years later they were only up to 1,371 officers.",180,,
894,0.97,5453.548,5455.383,Berkshire study called for 175 more.,180,,
895,0.97,5455.383,5464.792,So we had 41 more during that span of time.,180,,
896,0.97,5464.792,5469.897,I'm proud our city takes a Holistic view to safety and crime prevention.,180,,
897,0.97,5469.897,5474.068,We talked other programs in terms of restorative justice.,180,,
898,0.97,5474.068,5474.268,And.,180,,
899,0.97,5474.268,5478.973,The city should be supporting this whole menu of programs.,180,,
900,0.97,5478.973,5487.281,The benefit of having additional officers I think is so that they do have that bandwidth and time to get to know their community.,180,,
901,0.97,5487.281,5499.026,"To do real community policing because as we have seen from the numbers while you are able to maintain the 911 patrol, what we are drawing from the community policing teams.",180,,
902,0.97,5499.026,5512.974,"The bike patrol, the AV and the University district in district 4. I know that certain officers have been pulled from that to go to other parts of the city to do emphasis patrols away from the North precinct.",180,,
903,0.97,5512.974,5518.346,I attended a role call and I was alarmed by the small number of officers there.,180,,
904,0.97,5518.346,5521.682,The North precinct is 40% of the city's geography.,180,,
905,0.97,5521.682,5522.85,That is three Council districts.,180,,
906,0.97,5522.85,5534.095,"So, when you look at the numbers in the North Precinct, I know it is not just by geography.",180,,
907,0.97,5534.095,5542.336,"146 out of the 656 is 22% if you did 40%, North precinct would have 262 officers there.",180,,
908,0.97,5542.336,5558.686,"I know that's not the only metric you use, but I want to flag my concern about the shortage of officers and I want to be helpful and I am glad you mentioned other things you are trying to do.",180,,
909,0.97,5558.686,5560.655,I echo Councilmember Herbold's training academies.,180,,
910,0.97,5560.655,5564.191,Great news you will have an extra training Academy.,180,,
911,0.97,5564.191,5568.029,"Yes, historically, that was a major bottleneck.",180,,
912,0.97,5568.029,5585.88,"The concern about languages, I don't know if you talked about using community based organizations to help you because I know you mentioned the benefit of having two of you involved is you know all the recruits but I guess the downside is your own bandwidth.",180,,
913,0.97,5585.88,5589.85,"If you need additional bandwidth, additional companies are hiring huge numbers of people.",180,,
914,0.97,5589.85,5594.889,They have head hunters and huge teams that help with that.,180,,
915,0.97,5594.889,5615.843,And community based organizations speaking those diverse languages could help so I want to signal that I think we need more police officers to do that community policing and get to know the communities better and I just stand to want to support you in your efforts in 2020 and beyond.,180,,
916,0.97,5615.843,5616.61,Thank you.,181,,
917,0.97,5616.61,5618.212,Thank you.,182,,
918,0.97,5618.212,5620.214,Other comments or thoughts?,182,,
919,0.97,5620.214,5637.231,"Before we close, I want to emphasize that I think we all believe that a police Department that reflects our city's diversity has to be primary pillar of any effort to grow the size of our force.",182,,
920,0.97,5637.231,5657.785,"I think it is also important to recognize that the annual public safety surveys that Seattle University does, the need for more officers, both to respond to calls for service as well as to do Proactive policing is rated as a top priority.",182,,
921,0.97,5657.785,5662.256,The surveys are weighted to be accurate representations of demographics.,182,,
922,0.97,5662.256,5672.633,"And, I think that is an important thing to recognize.",182,,
923,0.97,5672.633,5684.578,Low income community of colors see these communities are often the communities that are most victimized by crime.,182,,
924,0.97,5684.578,5692.62,And I appreciate really the laser focus the police Department and the Mayor's office have put into staffing and recruitment.,182,,
925,0.97,5692.62,5701.128,"As mentioned earlier, we will be getting a report back from SPD, specifically on the 12 recommendations, funding as part of the retention and recruitment plan.",182,,
926,0.97,5701.128,5703.831,I think that is going to be coming to us in late May.,182,,
927,0.97,5703.831,5710.237,"So, we will have that opportunity to have you back some time after that.",182,,
928,0.97,5710.237,5717.411,"And we also, I urge folks to review the monthly reports on staffing.",182,,
929,0.97,5717.411,5728.522,We will not have you in every month to hear about the last month's staffing accomplishments but I encourage folks to read those.,182,,
930,0.97,5728.522,5733.127,"One point that I wanted to, and it is not something I need an answer to now.",182,,
931,0.97,5733.127,5756.717,"But, one of the things that I saw in the last staffing report is that the number of officers on disability is increasing over the last couple of years from high 30s to high 40s as a representation of the numbers of officers on disability.",182,,
932,0.97,5756.717,5765.893,"Just wondering whether or not, as it relates to all of the components that go into ensuring that officers are on the streets, it is not just retention.",182,,
933,0.97,5765.893,5769.597,It is not just hiring new officers.,182,,
934,0.97,5769.597,5778.372,It is also looking at the drivers that may be leading to fully trained officers not being able to work.,182,,
935,0.97,5778.372,5783.344,And just wondering whether or not there is anything that can be done to reverse a trend.,182,,
936,0.97,5783.344,5786.147,Putting officers on light duty when they are showing signs of an injury.,182,,
937,0.97,5786.147,5790.284,That is just something I would like to put in and take a look at later.,182,,
938,0.97,5790.284,5790.651,Thank you.,183,,
939,0.97,5790.651,5798.292,Thanks again for joining us.,184,,
940,0.97,5798.292,5798.759,Really appreciate it.,184,,
941,0.97,5798.759,5812.439,"All right, the last item on the agenda is a review of our draft, public safety and human services committee work plan, again, this is a draft document at this point, just wanting to highlight it.",185,,
942,0.97,5812.439,5819.213,Both for committee members as well as members of the public.,185,,
943,0.97,5819.213,5820.314,At a later date.,185,,
944,0.97,5820.314,5823.717,Maybe Greg as our community coordinator can fill us in on this.,185,,
945,0.97,5823.717,5833.627,"But, the plan is eventually for all committees to adopt the Council work plan by resolution.",185,,
946,0.97,5833.627,5836.931,So I see getting this draft out there is part of that process.,185,,
947,0.97,5836.931,5837.431,"Yes, Councilmember.",186,,
948,0.97,5837.431,5846.04,I believe that all of the Council committee work plans are going to be Adocumented by resolution on Monday.,186,,
949,0.97,5846.04,5861.622,"So, this draft work plan is one that is one of many work plans other committees are putting together and that will be attached to the resolution that you all will see on Monday.",186,,
950,0.97,5861.622,5861.889,Great.,187,,
951,0.97,5861.889,5864.425,"Quick introduction and then Greg, kick us off.",187,,
952,0.97,5864.425,5864.758,"Sure, Hi.",188,,
953,0.97,5864.758,5872.9,Not sure if this is on.,188,,
954,0.97,5872.9,5874.668,"Christina, with Councilmember Herbold's officer.",188,,
955,0.97,5874.668,5876.036,Still Greg Doss.,189,,
956,0.97,5876.036,5879.173,"Lisa Kay, central staff.",190,,
957,0.97,5879.173,5883.777,"Amy Gore, central staff.",191,,
958,0.97,5883.777,5884.778,Alex Clark.,192,,
959,0.97,5884.778,5885.412,Councilmember Herbold's office.,192,,
960,0.97,5885.412,5887.715,I asked my fell row central staffer to join me here.,193,,
961,0.97,5887.715,5892.92,Because it is is a long work plan with a lot of complexity.,193,,
962,0.97,5892.92,5907.668,"While we will be going through it at a very high clip, I don't know many of the issue areas that are not criminal justice related and specifically police related so I am going to look to my colleagues to help describe those.",193,,
963,0.97,5907.668,5920.648,"So with that, actually, I am going to go ahead and turn it over to Asha to at a very high level start capturing some of the criminal justice policy reform items.",193,,
964,0.97,5920.648,5926.82,"As she is talking, I will move through the items.",193,,
965,0.97,5926.82,5939.633,"So, a lot of the items listed under criminal justice policy reform, I want to zoom out a little bit toe the process that my colleague Carlos is currently engaged in around criminal legal system alignment.",194,,
966,0.97,5939.633,5955.949,"And so, a lot of if items you will see in here as far as reform, conferences, there are a couple of other items around.",194,,
967,0.97,5955.949,5956.617,High barrier probation.,194,,
968,0.97,5956.617,5971.865,To figure out moving North precinct ward what it is that Council can use with the intent that the whole city could be aligned around what kind of principles that everyone should use to figure out what policies should move forward.,194,,
969,0.97,5971.865,5974.735,How investments should move forward.,194,,
970,0.97,5974.735,5993.754,"So, as we are talking about the pieces that are in this work plan, a lot of them came up during last budget cycle so a lot of them are about asking the executive or the courts or the city attorney's office to report back how they are developing some of the policies they wanted to move forward during that time.",194,,
971,0.97,5993.754,5998.892,And what it would like like to implement those.,194,,
972,0.97,5998.892,6002.93,"So, Ly start on a high level with bail reform.",194,,
973,0.97,6002.93,6009.536,Councilmember Herbold had put together a statement of legislative intent asking around what kind of pretrial release strategies we were using.,194,,
974,0.97,6009.536,6011.305,If cash became was a thing we would continue to do.,194,,
975,0.97,6011.305,6025.552,"So that effort has been folded into this criminal legal system alignment effort as a more, as a broader question about how to do pretrial reform efforts.",194,,
976,0.97,6025.552,6030.924,"The capturing race data piece, I'm not personally staffing but Greg, if you have thoughts about that?",194,,
977,0.97,6030.924,6051.345,"This one was a particular add to the budget that Councilmember Gonzalez made that is specifically around SPD capturing race data related to Latino but I think it is, Latinex.",195,,
978,0.97,6051.345,6051.578,Sorry.,195,,
979,0.97,6051.578,6056.25,They are classified under the Caucasian category.,196,,
980,0.97,6056.25,6057.518,Yes.,197,,
981,0.97,6057.518,6057.785,Exactly.,197,,
982,0.97,6057.785,6061.622,That is a particular issue the committee will be following.,197,,
983,0.97,6061.622,6070.264,"On the case Conferencing piece, this is one of the items that came out of the high barrier individuals work group.",198,,
984,0.97,6070.264,6082.476,"And, the intent was for the city attorney's office to add a Prosecutor to convene case Conferencing.",198,,
985,0.97,6082.476,6096.156,They are supposed to be coming back with it I believe in April about how they will go forward implementing any kind of case Conferencing what a rush equity analysis looks like.,198,,
986,0.97,6096.156,6108.168,"Charged by officer program, the SPD has the ability to write criminal citations for some Misdemeanors, send folks directly to the court rather than booking them into jail.",199,,
987,0.97,6108.168,6117.711,This is a slide that got passed so the Council could get a little information about how much that program is being used.,199,,
