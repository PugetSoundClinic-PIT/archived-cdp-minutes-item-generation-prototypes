243,0.97,1614.079,1615.38,They were only eight years old.,27,,
244,0.97,1615.38,1619.851,"I decided to take them out of school because I, as a child, always loved going to the Aquarium.",27,,
245,0.97,1619.851,1625.256,It was one of the tracks we made over for school assemblies.,27,,
246,0.97,1625.256,1642.107,"Even when we couldn't go in, because we didn't have very much money to go into the Aquarium, my dad would still walk us on the outside where we could see the salmon and things.",27,,
247,0.97,1642.107,1643.274,We could see those outside pieces.,27,,
248,0.97,1643.274,1648.446,That was one of the important parts that I wanted to bring to this conversation.,27,,
249,0.97,1648.446,1649.948,Making sure there were those outside pieces.,27,,
250,0.97,1649.948,1653.151,It didn't matter if you had the money or not to pay for it.,27,,
251,0.97,1653.151,1655.453,You still got to be immersed in that experience.,27,,
252,0.97,1655.453,1664.095,There was still something to tell right there.,27,,
253,0.97,1664.095,1667.599,The Seattle Aquarium has lots of ways to help people that cannot afford that at this point.,27,,
254,0.97,1667.599,1671.503,We also discussed at the meeting the vibrancy of ocean plants and animals.,27,,
255,0.97,1671.503,1681.513,It is important to share those successes while also educating on the dangers and the new technologies we have to deal with things like ocean Acidification.,27,,
256,0.97,1681.513,1696.861,Looking at the importance of oral histories and the witnessing process that has been with our tribe since time immemorial.,27,,
257,0.97,1696.861,1699.03,I know it's with a lot of other communities too.,27,,
258,0.97,1699.03,1700.098,We witnessed that piece.,27,,
259,0.97,1700.098,1700.932,We hold people accountable.,27,,
260,0.97,1700.932,1708.073,We make sure that land and that C is available for the people that need it.,27,,
261,0.97,1708.073,1714.779,In this spirit I was honored to the Aquarium team offered me an opportunity to go to Bali with them to visit the Coral Triangle center.,27,,
262,0.97,1714.779,1727.525,"There is a part that felt very uncomfortable, trying to make sure we were representing a culture that I did not know very well.",27,,
263,0.97,1727.525,1737.802,I was so blown away by what I experienced in Bali Thomas seeing what was going on and the Commonalities between my tribe and the indigenous people there.,27,,
264,0.97,1737.802,1739.571,And recognizing that one ocean concept.,27,,
265,0.97,1739.571,1745.143,That the same ocean is the same ocean that my dad fishes in.,27,,
266,0.97,1745.143,1750.715,It's the same ocean that we are bringing back basket Cockles with.,27,,
267,0.97,1750.715,1759.124,It's the same one that we use to commute on a journey.,27,,
268,0.97,1759.124,1760.525,That was really powerful for me.,27,,
269,0.97,1760.525,1762.26,I learned a lot from that trip.,27,,
270,0.97,1762.26,1787.051,"I came back feeling even more passionate about making sure that this concept of one ocean, this concept of how we welcome these animals and these plans back here . I think that this was a really amazing opportunity . next slide please.",27,,
271,0.97,1787.051,1801.099,In keeping with that sense of making sure we hear from the community the process for getting the art has been another one that had a lot of Representatives on the committee.,27,,
272,0.97,1801.099,1808.273,This is Dan.,27,,
273,0.97,1808.273,1810.475,"His presentation, all of the presentations were so good.",27,,
274,0.97,1810.475,1815.28,It was really difficult . I shouldn't say it was difficult.,27,,
275,0.97,1815.28,1829.661,"It was a real honor to get to sit and watch these presentations and think about their artistic interpretation of what we were doing and what we described, and the embodiment of that in those pieces.",27,,
276,0.97,1829.661,1833.731,It was definitely clear that Dan was the right person for this job.,27,,
277,0.97,1833.731,1834.766,Here's this great image of him.,27,,
278,0.97,1834.766,1847.512,"Anna gives this really nice movement, which we are hoping will really come through in the installation once it's there with these loan glass salmon.",27,,

280,0.97,1858.556,1870.401,"You will find on the outside, as Susan was talking about, the different ways in which the ocean pavilion, upland to Low- end part, they are working with Valerie . She is incredible at this.",27,,
281,0.97,1870.401,1872.136,I learned a lot anytime she's speaking.,27,,
282,0.97,1872.136,1882.547,"But really looking at what some of those natural plants were, that were right here.",27,,
283,0.97,1882.547,1884.649,They were actually gathered in the spot.,27,,
284,0.97,1884.649,1888.586,Recognizing Dan.,27,,
285,0.97,1888.586,1902.867,Making sure that princess Angeline's place was within a stone's throw on this area.,27,,
286,0.97,1902.867,1904.335,She would have looked down on this place.,27,,
287,0.97,1904.335,1906.371,Finding all of those different connections was really wonderful.,27,,
288,0.97,1906.371,1909.04,There will be a lot of opportunities for interpretation.,27,,

342,0.97,2202.867,2214.545,The only salmon run that runs entirely through the city of Seattle freshwater waterways.,29,,
343,0.97,2214.545,2227.892,"I wonder if anyone on the panel would like to expand on ways in which the Aquarium has been a strong public partner on Fisheries, salmon in particular.",29,,
344,0.97,2227.892,2238.302,But also any additional information if folks want to fill in a little bit more the conservation mission and some of the ongoing initiatives that the Aquarium has.,29,,
345,0.97,2238.302,2243.608,I think that work has been really inspiring to get to know better.,29,,
346,0.97,2243.608,2248.546,Committee members would be interested in asking additional follow-ups as well.,29,,
347,0.97,2248.546,2248.98,Great.,30,,
348,0.97,2248.98,2260.992,I feel like I should start with our Cedar River salmon journey program that we have been operating for a couple of decades now with a variety of partners.,30,,
349,0.97,2260.992,2265.229,That's a program that we run annually where we bring staff and volunteers out along the Cedar River to educate people.,30,,
350,0.97,2265.229,2269.7,Just the public coming by.,30,,
351,0.97,2269.7,2280.911,"To come by and learn about salmon, learn about the challenges they face, and learn what they can do to be part of a solution.",30,,
352,0.97,2280.911,2286.517,Also being down around the waterfront.,30,,
353,0.97,2286.517,2290.121,Among all of the things we've been talking about that has been exciting on the waterfront redevelopment.,30,,
354,0.97,2290.121,2293.457,A part of that 20 to 25 block park.,30,,
355,0.97,2293.457,2301.499,"There's going to be water filtration, storm water pollution filtration happening along our waterfront for the first time since there were wetlands along there.",30,,
356,0.97,2301.499,2303.167,Which was a long time ago.,30,,
357,0.97,2303.167,2312.777,We are hopeful that will help restore water quality to Elliott Bay and other parts along our urban waterfronts.,30,,
358,0.97,2312.777,2331.395,It's a nice dovetail of work that happened to transform the Seawall into something that is creating enabling conditions for life for salmon that migrate along the urban waterways.,30,,
359,0.97,2333.531,2337.735,"In thinking of some of our other projects and programs that help support salmon and Rockfish and daughters, my goodness.",30,,
360,0.97,2337.735,2341.739,We have over one dozen active research and conservation projects here at home throughout the outer coast of Washington.,30,,
361,0.97,2341.739,2344.542,We have active projects in Hawaii and on the other side of the Pacific.,30,,
362,0.97,2344.542,2348.879,Focusing at home for a moment.,30,,
363,0.97,2348.879,2354.618,There is an exciting new project in partnership that we just recently launched with the port of Seattle.,30,,
364,0.97,2354.618,2357.988,We are doing research to understand what's happening with our kelp forests along our urban waterways.,30,,
365,0.97,2357.988,2365.963,Why they are where they are so that we can better support restoration of kelp forests in our urban waterways.,30,,
366,0.97,2365.963,2370.434,Recognizing that kelp is struggling all around Washington's waters.,30,,
367,0.97,2370.434,2391.322,"For many reasons it's important to start right here in our waterfront, where we cannot only help support health Ecosystems but it also is an incredible opportunity to engage our urban communities to help people see and understand what is happening right here at home where you are walking along the waterfront.",30,,
368,0.97,2391.322,2396.66,There's a lot of life right underwater and indeed under your feet when you are walking along the waterfront.,30,,
369,0.97,2396.66,2399.096,"The Aquarium has, as I mentioned, over one dozen projects.",30,,
370,0.97,2399.096,2422.987,"We have had a long-term program on sea Otters on the outer coast, where we monitor their health . We monitor what they are eating and where they are eating so we can understand what is happening with that species that was reintroduced to our waters after it was almost fully extinct.",30,,
371,0.97,2422.987,2426.056,"I imagine we will be continuing that project for a long, long time into the future.",30,,
372,0.97,2426.056,2429.226,We are coupling that with some work now to understand what is happening underwater.,30,,
373,0.97,2429.226,2445.376,Another new project that we launched with funding from the North Pacific Coast MRC--among others to understand what is happening with kelp forests and Ecosystems over there.,30,,
374,0.97,2445.376,2448.112,I could go on and on for hours talking about our projects and programs.,30,,
375,0.97,2448.112,2448.879,I will pause there.,30,,
376,0.97,2448.879,2450.648,Thank you very much.,31,,
377,0.97,2450.648,2462.693,"I definitely encourage counsel colleagues, if they have the time and capacity, to go and take advantage of an in person to her where this information about the conservation initiative is readily available.",31,,
378,0.97,2462.693,2468.032,A big part of that visit.,31,,
379,0.97,2468.032,2473.838,Two colleagues have any questions?,31,,
380,0.97,2473.838,2478.309,I don't see any questions from other committee members at this time.,31,,
381,0.97,2478.309,2487.618,"I would like an update, potentially, if someone is on the panel to prepare to answer a question along these lines.",31,,
382,0.97,2487.618,2510.674,"As we come out of Covid how was the Aquarium adjusting to a return of tourists to the waterfront, a return of activity, the ability to go back to indoor spaces like the Aquarium?",31,,
383,0.97,2510.674,2516.847,How is that recovery coming along?,31,,
384,0.97,2516.847,2518.682,What are some of the hurdles you are facing?,31,,
385,0.97,2518.682,2519.083,Thanks.,32,,
386,0.97,2519.083,2522.186,I will take a crack at that.,32,,
387,0.97,2522.186,2527.224,As you may remember the Aquarium was closed for 222 days during the pandemic.,32,,
388,0.97,2527.224,2529.927,Two different periods.,32,,
389,0.97,2529.927,2542.907,We were very fortunate to have assistance from Federal and city sources and county sources.,32,,
390,0.97,2542.907,2546.677,State sources.,32,,
391,0.97,2546.677,2553.05,To help us to get through and survive that period.,32,,
392,0.97,2553.05,2564.161,"What we have not found, as you see, as you walk along the waterfront, or looked down from the upper hills of the city.",32,,
393,0.97,2564.161,2571.568,The waterfront is bursting with human beings . lots of families.,32,,
394,0.97,2571.568,2577.942,There is definitely a pent-up demand to be out with your family.,32,,
395,0.97,2577.942,2582.079,A definite demand to enjoy the waterfront.,32,,
396,0.97,2582.079,2597.761,"People are getting a bite to eat, going to games . within the Aquarium itself our attendance is now back at the level that it was Pre-Covid.",32,,
397,0.97,2597.761,2604.001,People are there.,32,,
398,0.97,2604.001,2609.606,They are in a variety of protective gear or none.,32,,
399,0.97,2609.606,2630.294,"The one thing that has been slower to come back has been the organized classroom groups, which I think a lot of the school district's have been cautious about . bringing those school groups back on field trips.",32,,
400,0.97,2630.294,2630.894,That's starting to change.,32,,
401,0.97,2630.894,2645.709,"Next year we are looking forward to, depending on how things have developed by then, we are looking forward to a return of school groups then.",32,,
402,0.97,2645.709,2654.551,We have a summer camp program that is back and also sold out.,32,,
403,0.97,2654.551,2655.586,It's operating at 75% capacity.,32,,
404,0.97,2655.586,2657.888,It is one of my favorite times of the year.,32,,
405,0.97,2657.888,2672.102,To go through the Aquarium and see all of these young kids in their summer camp T-shirts loving their experience at the Seattle Aquarium.,32,,
406,0.97,2672.102,2673.971,A couple of things to add to that.,33,,
407,0.97,2673.971,2689.753,"One of the things that we did in response to being able to manage how many people were moving through our spaces, now you can go Online and purchase your ticket in advance and choose a time that works for you.",33,,
408,0.97,2689.753,2691.555,That has worked doubly well.,33,,
409,0.97,2691.555,2699.663,Both from a safety perspective but also it spreads out our visitors so it is a more enjoyable expense in the Aquarium.,33,,
410,0.97,2699.663,2704.201,It's something that is a positive outcome.,33,,
411,0.97,2704.201,2719.45,"Speaking to our region to schools, we didn't close all of our programs.",33,,
412,0.97,2719.45,2720.751,We kept our conservation programs active.,33,,
413,0.97,2720.751,2721.652,That included our school programs.,33,,
414,0.97,2721.652,2722.92,But it meant you Pivoted virtually.,33,,
415,0.97,2722.92,2735.265,Now that we are sort of on the other side we are doing both.,33,,
416,0.97,2738.168,2742.139,"We are doing virtual programming with schools, virtual programming with community partners, and starting to do on-site programming again.",33,,
417,0.97,2742.139,2747.644,From an access perspective that is a way for us to reach into the communities and schools and reach partners we would not otherwise be able to reach.,33,,
418,0.97,2747.644,2750.147,The way forward for us in the program area is likely hybrid.,33,,
419,0.97,2750.147,2756.086,We actually have our first hybrid in person virtual event tomorrow night . A lightning talks event.,33,,
420,0.97,2756.086,2759.156,We used to have all the time before the pandemic.,33,,
421,0.97,2759.156,2769.366,It is our first virtual hybrid in person event for the public.,33,,
422,0.97,2769.366,2773.07,"With the different school groups, you said 200 school districts that the Aquarium has had a relationship with.",34,,
423,0.97,2773.07,2774.905,What is the Furthest school district?,34,,
424,0.97,2774.905,2780.043,How far away?,34,,
425,0.97,2780.043,2783.08,Golden Dale is quite a ways away.,35,,
426,0.97,2783.08,2793.39,I know that we have had school Dstricts in the Spokane area.,35,,
427,0.97,2793.39,2795.526,And from all of the corners of the state.,35,,
428,0.97,2795.526,2798.729,Great.,36,,
429,0.97,2798.729,2800.364,Did you have something to add to that?,36,,
430,0.97,2800.364,2809.006,I'm picturing our map that I have actually stars all the schools we have worked with.,37,,
431,0.97,2809.006,2810.44,There are stars all over the state.,37,,
432,0.97,2810.44,2815.279,"As you can imagine, especially before the pandemic, there is a larger concentration within a couple of our drive for on-site programming.",37,,
433,0.97,2815.279,2822.986,But we also have always had a program where we go to schools and go to the communities to meet people where they are.,37,,
434,0.97,2822.986,2826.857,That is how we have reached communities and schools in other parts of the state as well.,37,,
435,0.97,2826.857,2828.892,Great.,38,,
436,0.97,2828.892,2839.603,"Pivoting back to the ocean pavilion, which is just going to be such an exciting centerpiece of what we are doing on the Seattle waterfront.",38,,
437,0.97,2839.603,2847.578,I know that's ring has been the Timeline.,38,,
438,0.97,2847.578,2854.685,Has that been impacted by the concrete strike or any other kind of delay that we have experienced during the Covid era?,38,,
439,0.97,2854.685,2859.456,Do we anticipate that to be a fairly set target?,38,,
440,0.97,2859.456,2866.396,What are the external factors that could affect it?,38,,
441,0.97,2866.396,2880.544,When the concrete strike was happening we were in a phase of doing work in the ground with stabilizing the soil and getting the foundation in there.,39,,
442,0.97,2880.544,2889.419,We didn't really have an impact when the concrete started flowing at the time we needed it again.,39,,
443,0.97,2889.419,2893.223,It didn't disrupt our schedule.,39,,
444,0.97,2893.223,2902.466,It has delayed some of the schedule with the switching of the road.,39,,
445,0.97,2902.466,2907.571,But we have been able to be very flexible and nimble in keeping the project going.,39,,
446,0.97,2907.571,2928.292,"We are in the process of having a small portion to help, so when we are going vertical in the building, which you saw with all those forms, we have a way to protect cars that are going through that area and workers that are working on the project.",39,,
447,0.97,2928.292,2930.627,All of those things have allowed us to keep going.,39,,
448,0.97,2930.627,2937.234,Certainly funding and fundraising is a portion that keeps the project moving along as well.,39,,
449,0.97,2937.234,2946.343,With all of that in place and planned we feel like we will be able to accomplish that by the 2024 date.,39,,
450,0.97,2946.343,2948.445,We are on schedule at this point.,39,,
451,0.97,2948.445,2948.712,Great.,40,,
452,0.97,2948.712,2955.585,"Counsel colleagues, any questions for our panel?",40,,
453,0.97,2955.585,2955.819,Yes.,41,,

458,0.97,2982.012,2984.915,There have been so many people and hands on this and so much work.,43,,
459,0.97,2984.915,2986.249,"Friends of the waterfront, the lid, everything.",43,,
460,0.97,2986.249,2991.555,I always make fun of the two.,43,,
461,0.97,2991.555,2992.723,Bob Davidson and Bob don again.,43,,
462,0.97,2992.723,2993.557,Friends of the waterfront.,43,,
463,0.97,2993.557,2997.661,"Of course Thatcher, Maggie, Marshall and all of the folks that were on the other side of raising money.",43,,
464,0.97,2997.661,3014.511,A special shout out to the Suquamish nation and Robin and the chairman who have instituted in being open to this whole Comanagement approach with travel governments on the waterfront.,43,,
465,0.97,3014.511,3015.679,Ringing in local tribal leadership.,43,,
466,0.97,3015.679,3025.389,Not only for the structure but also for being honest and authentic about the city of Seattle's history.,43,,
467,0.97,3025.389,3036.266,"When people come here, and tourists come here, they see the real Seattle and the original stewards of the land.",43,,
468,0.97,3036.266,3038.001,We were talking about this 10 years ago.,43,,
469,0.97,3038.001,3039.936,I never thought we would get this far.,43,,
470,0.97,3039.936,3048.879,Being on counsel and having the opportunity to share and working with these great groups that wanted this to happen.,43,,
471,0.97,3048.879,3053.817,"Robin, thank you for bringing up the canoe journeys and all of that stuff.",43,,
472,0.97,3053.817,3057.721,The canoe Jersey stops down at the port every summer.,43,,
473,0.97,3057.721,3062.059,"Not the poor, the waterfront.",43,,
474,0.97,3062.059,3066.196,Bob Davidson has always been such a good Steward and good partner I want to thank him for that.,43,,
475,0.97,3066.196,3077.307,We didn't always agree on everything but we agreed on enough.,43,,
476,0.97,3077.307,3079.376,-- thank you so much.,43,,
477,0.97,3079.376,3084.448,I really appreciate that you posted those pictures of your daughters again.,43,,

481,0.97,3089.886,3108.772,And thank you for lifting up that work from--it is a great honor to have a constituent to Console on these projects that impact the waterfront now that she is back in town from her time at Harvard.,44,,
482,0.97,3108.772,3112.909,Are there any other questions from committee members?,44,,
483,0.97,3112.909,3113.477,Councilmember Mosqueda?,44,,

486,0.97,3128.825,3139.369,I know that my family had a chance to visit during the pandemic on one of the Semi- rainy days.,45,,
487,0.97,3139.369,3162.425,"It was a great escape from the routine of being so isolated, having the chance to be in a place that was really adhering to Covid protocols and making sure that the patrons were masked.",45,,
488,0.97,3162.425,3166.263,It was helpful to know that you are safe and engage in educational opportunities for kids and adults.,45,,
489,0.97,3166.263,3168.498,I want to thank the Aquarium for all they have done.,45,,

496,0.97,3200.63,3200.931,Okay.,46,,
497,0.97,3200.931,3201.464,I'm seeing none.,46,,
498,0.97,3201.464,3203.366,This was a really great discussion.,46,,
499,0.97,3203.366,3223.153,"I do just want to point out that the Council will have some additional legislation before it, related to the Aquarium . We determined it would be better suited in the Finance and housing committee.",46,,
500,0.97,3223.153,3233.463,We did foreshadow that legislation coming in this morning's Finance and housing committee with Mosqueda giving an overview of the committee meeting.,46,,
501,0.97,3233.463,3245.809,"Can you remind me, council member Mosqueda, how the legislation is going to be taken up?",46,,
502,0.97,3245.809,3248.278,Is it in two weeks when we have our first meeting?,46,,
503,0.97,3248.278,3260.423,We are going to have 3 to 5 pieces of legislation in front of us at the August 11th meeting.,47,,
