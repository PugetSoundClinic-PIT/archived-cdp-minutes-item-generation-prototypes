0,0.97,17.517,20.954,Hank you for coming back.,0,,
1,0.97,20.954,23.323,I'm Teresa Mosqueda chair of the budget committee.,0,,
2,0.97,23.323,26.059,"Today is October 1st, 2021 and the time is 2:02 P.M.",0,,
3,0.97,26.059,33.933,We are going to go ahead and start with session two of our agenda today.,0,,
4,0.97,33.933,56.256,"Madam clerk, could you please call the roll for the select budget committee.",0,,
5,0.97,56.256,67.2,[roll called].,0,,
6,0.97,67.2,68.034,Thank you very much Madam clerk.,1,,
7,0.97,68.034,73.173,I want to thank you for the time you have taken in the last Two-And-A-Half days and we are near the finish line.,1,,
8,0.97,73.173,82.215,What we have in front of us is a present taking from a diversity of human services Department.,1,,
9,0.97,82.215,105.138,And office of emergency management and office of housing and the city budget's office as it relates to Covid response and then we will round out the day with a presentation from human services Department on items that are not related to homelessness services.,1,,
10,0.97,105.138,114.981,"I want to thank Tonya Kim, Kareem Mayor and Emily Alvarado and Ben noble along with Julia.",1,,
11,0.97,114.981,130.563,I want to thank you for having a large panel today as we seek to understand more about how the 2022 proposed budget that the Mayor transmitted on Monday has a more equitable recovery.,1,,
12,0.97,130.563,139.806,We are focused on response and recovery and hopeful that we will have a chance for time for questions at the end as well.,1,,
13,0.97,139.806,175.408,"Much like the conversation at the national level, recovery is not just about infrastructure and making sure that buildings and the brick and mortar of our city has what they need and recovery is centered on whether humans have investments in our infrastructure that allows us to go to work like child care and support services like transportation that runs on time and making sure that our Elders have food and our kids have a place to go to, to learn.",1,,
14,0.97,175.408,192.559,"Looking forward to hearing from you from the work that city Council has done with our joint effort with the Mayor around the Seattle rescue plan act for the first funds that we have, just start Seattle that was in the first two years dedicated to Covid response.",1,,
15,0.97,192.559,232.165,And it has been a long two years but I think that the news conference as of late has reflected back on the jump start and to make sure we had early investment in community and small businesses into our most vulnerable and city Department to make sure we weather the storm that is Covid by actively using our jump start projected funds as we spent some of the rainy day investments.,1,,
16,0.97,232.165,239.806,And that helped us to come out stronger than many cities and looking forward to this.,1,,
17,0.97,239.806,240.506,I will go to director noble.,1,,
18,0.97,240.506,242.041,We are almost at the end here.,1,,
19,0.97,242.041,247.447,Two more presentations to go and thank you for being with us the last three days.,1,,
20,0.97,247.447,252.785,Totally my pleasure and moving to the next slide.,2,,
21,0.97,252.785,271.437,"As I promised on Wednesday the presentation on Federal funding and to make it unlike some of the presentations this is not entirely forward looking, some is to provide you an update on the resources that has been allocated this year.",2,,
22,0.97,271.437,280.647,In particular Seattle rescue plan one and two are the somewhat flexible dollars in the first Coronavirus relief.,2,,
23,0.97,280.647,287.72,And then also some of the more targeted dollars that went to specific programs.,2,,
24,0.97,287.72,301.134,We will update you and give you an update on FEMA and the expenditures and the work that we have been doing to get repaid by FEMA and the processes there and the Timeline that we have been seeing.,2,,
25,0.97,301.134,315.481,And the more detail part of the presentation is about the proposal to spend Federal money and the remainder part of the Clipper dollars and potentially $116 million of the trench.,2,,
26,0.97,315.481,322.088,That is incorporated into the 2022 budget and we want to give you a comprehensive look how it fits together.,2,,
27,0.97,322.088,326.959,And we will wrap up giving you a lay of the land of what is to come.,2,,
28,0.97,326.959,336.769,I was just checking CNN and the New York times before I logged in to see what the latest from D.C. where some of the issues are being debated.,2,,
29,0.97,336.769,344.844,I wanted to give you a sense of how we are positioning.,2,,
30,0.97,344.844,363.563,That's the agenda and first up is Seattle rescue plan one so if we advance the next slide.,2,,
31,0.97,363.563,382.448,Good afternoon I am curry Mayer the director of Seattle emergency management and happy to be here and thank you for inviting me and happy to share with you what is happening and the reimbursement we have received from FEMA.,3,,
32,0.97,382.448,395.862,It has been $4.8 million in funding approval from the public assistant's office with 2.1 million in review with our state partners that will be forwarded on to FEMA.,3,,
33,0.97,395.862,410.042,13.2 million in preparation for Submittal by the city Department that comes first through the office of emergency management and I have additional details on the developments for the next slide.,3,,
34,0.97,410.042,451.884,To give you an idea some of the projects from other departments are things like all of the Ppe that FAS purchased at the beginning and quarantine and isolation facilities and then we have a second funding project for our vaccination efforts and important to note that there are those two funding strains for Departmnt projects and then vaccine and separate.,3,,
35,0.97,451.884,466.566,We noted here that eligibility is extended to December because we thought it might end in September and that allows us to apply for additional items to be reimbursed through FEMA.,3,,
36,0.97,466.566,476.642,It is important to note that this is unusual event for FEMA and it is a disaster it is a public health emergency that they do not have a lot of experience with.,3,,
37,0.97,476.642,494.861,They are used to disasters that have a short period of time short area of impact and long term management and this is different as we are still in it and making changes as we go along in terms of what it is to help people.,3,,
38,0.97,494.861,514.947,It means that FEMA is taking time on their guidance and the guidance on what is eligible and ways not and they have added to the safe reopening costs and will be looking at that for possible eligible items.,3,,
39,0.97,514.947,530.062,"And just to underscore that because it is unusual, FEMA is struggling a little bit to catch up with the Covid work and the other disaster work.",3,,
40,0.97,530.062,548.915,"Hurricanes and Wildfires and those things that they have a lot of experience with are still happening and also require reimbursement and it can make our reimbursement Timelines for this draft more dynamic, the reach for Covid is across the nation.",3,,
41,0.97,548.915,556.923,There's no place in the nation that this disaster has not touched.,3,,
42,0.97,556.923,563.863,And so you can imagine it is a body giant of work across the country what are the things to be reimbursed.,3,,
43,0.97,563.863,581.581,We have FEMA Federal funding for additional vaccine work that last bullet through an extension of our contract with public health Seattle King County for the new vaccination work that will be happening.,3,,
44,0.97,581.581,594.093,For the boosters and the other things we do to negotiate that contract and we are extending it.,3,,
45,0.97,594.093,594.594,All right.,3,,
46,0.97,594.594,595.428,"So next slide, please.",3,,
47,0.97,595.428,626.659,"This gives you a Snapshot and more details on what has been occurring and what we are submitting to FEMA for possible reimbursement, you can see on this side on the far left-hand side are the departments NA have submitted projects to the office of emergency management that we then review and we send to our state partners and to FEMA.",3,,
48,0.97,626.659,635.001,We send them to our state partners because they do a more extensive review before sending to FEMA that is good.,3,,
49,0.97,635.001,648.481,It is more likely that reimbursements will be in good shape and not need additional documentation prior to going to FEMA so that saves us time and that's a good thing.,3,,
50,0.97,648.481,668.2,They also expect--we expect the reimbursement to be reflected in the 2022 budget and that comes from potential Eligibilityity to spend the funds.,3,,
51,0.97,668.2,674.54,The projects further in review are for more reimbursement and receipt.,3,,
52,0.97,674.54,693.192,If FEMA APPROVES the possibility of eligibility up front then those items should not take as long as new items that have not been previously reviewed.,3,,
53,0.97,693.192,724.757,"Projections for the general Fund are waited for 2023 for the f SA Fund are spread across for 2021, 22, 23 and there are 20 projects total for the Department, S DOT and traffic management at testing sites and also Ppe and library and personnel for the fire Department.",3,,
54,0.97,724.757,728.027,Can I ask a question to clarify on the slide.,4,,
55,0.97,728.027,741.574,I guess I want to make sure are the columns added if there was a final column Tothe right would you see a total in what has been allocated to each of those two departments?,4,,
56,0.97,741.574,762.094,"This is tracking the work that we will do to seek reimbursement, we have submitted claims for 21.4 and what we hope over time that the far right-hand column adds up 21.",5,,
57,0.97,762.094,769.602,Eventually the Submittals are approved and tracking the timing of the likely repayment to us.,5,,
58,0.97,769.602,776.976,Julie has better clarification than I have offered.,5,,
59,0.97,776.976,788.621,That is right with one slight nuance is an independent total.,6,,
60,0.97,788.621,800.166,I think it would be helpful to have a column to the right for the totals and a grand total on the far right column too.,7,,
61,0.97,800.166,800.432,Right.,8,,
62,0.97,800.432,804.803,That would be helpful to see visually.,8,,
63,0.97,804.803,818.284,The city has fronted this money and we are seeking reimbursement and developing a model and seeing a summary of our expectations of when the payments will come.,9,,
64,0.97,818.284,820.786,"And very telling, thank you.",10,,
65,0.97,820.786,822.488,Okay.,11,,
66,0.97,822.488,834.934,So just the last thing to emphasize is the duration of the pandemic makes it more complicated in terms of when the funding will be returned to us.,11,,
67,0.97,834.934,848.781,They could extend the incident date and change in our favor and just know that there is two channels of work.,11,,
68,0.97,848.781,851.083,The independent departments and the project departments.,11,,
69,0.97,851.083,856.155,That is all I have for the summary unless there is other questions.,11,,
70,0.97,856.155,862.094,"Great, thank you so much, curry.",12,,
71,0.97,862.094,863.429,You bet.,13,,
72,0.97,863.429,886.185,From here we will head into the questions as we go like we did in the first presentation so this is a high level of multiple departments so it is okay for us to do that but I will ask to be short with commentary.,14,,
73,0.97,886.185,886.919,Councilwoman Herbold.,14,,
74,0.97,886.919,887.219,Thanks.,15,,
75,0.97,887.219,893.826,"On-site two it limited female eligibility extend to December 31st, 2021.",15,,
76,0.97,893.826,899.665,And wondering what we know about FEMA eligibility being extended to 2022.,15,,
77,0.97,899.665,922.087,And as it relates to the conversation we just had about the details of Reimbursable expenses and really appreciate this information being provided and still not quite sure because we built a budget based on some sort of assumptions about reimbursement.,15,,
78,0.97,922.087,936.669,I see what we have--what we are applying for but what our assumptions about what we will get for the categories.,15,,
79,0.97,936.669,936.902,Thanks.,15,,
80,0.97,936.902,942.074,I can speak to the incident eligibility about what that date is about.,16,,
81,0.97,942.074,958.09,"So FEMA usually looks at a disaster, say, the North Ridge earthquake and says the eligibility for projects is this amount of time and anything that happens outside that eligibility or incident period.",16,,
82,0.97,958.09,989.188,Would not be considered for reimbursement for this event because it keeps rapidly changing and they have waited until the last minute so first of all it was September and I think we found out maybe a couple of days before the beginning of September it would extend the incident date to December 31st and that could change but most likely they will wait until the last minute and it is important to remember that they are balancing other work.,16,,
83,0.97,989.188,1002.668,The hurricanes and what happens with Wildfires and what not where they actually deploy stuff to help so that is a bigger burden where right now they are not deploying stuff for Covid.,16,,
84,0.97,1002.668,1042.441,"And the other portion and I will happened it to Julie, for the other question, Councilmember Herbold, because it is a reimbursement activity rather than we know we will get this amount, it is a little more vague in terms of the total amounts unless it is what we have spent in terms of emergency protective measures and the largest category of FEMA assistance and what have you done to protect the public.",16,,
85,0.97,1042.441,1043.809,Hopefully that is helpful.,16,,
86,0.97,1043.809,1044.543,Julie.,16,,
87,0.97,1044.543,1044.777,Yes.,17,,
88,0.97,1044.777,1053.986,"Actually, if we could go to the next slide actually Councilmember Herbold the final three bullets may provide clarity for what you are asking.",17,,
89,0.97,1053.986,1067.8,This is our an spending as we are estimating at this point that it is likely eligible and as it moves through the process it gets more refined.,17,,
90,0.97,1067.8,1081.18,"As it goes through, we expect that 21.4 for example, in the left-hand side to get more to the state and FEMA.",17,,
91,0.97,1081.18,1087.019,In the budget we are assuming some revenues coming in and we are balanced to those.,17,,
92,0.97,1087.019,1093.292,"Those revenues, the third bullet is explaining they are heavily weighted towards 2023.",17,,
93,0.97,1093.292,1106.472,They have a significant amount of time associated with it and when FEMA changes their minds on things then that adds to that uncertainty as well.,17,,
94,0.97,1106.472,1116.482,"For example, the general fund we have 1.4 million assumed for 2022 and then closer to 20 million, 17-And-A-Half for 2023.",17,,
95,0.97,1116.482,1123.922,And so we will sort of see those as they roll in the future and be able to refine those estimates over time.,17,,
96,0.97,1123.922,1130.362,"Is there anything you would add to that, Ben?",17,,
97,0.97,1130.362,1151.85,"No a constructive model here and we know what stage we are at with each of these elements and with that, we would make an estimate of how much we expect to receive in our forecast based on that and what we understand has been the timing on FEMA.",18,,
98,0.97,1151.85,1161.793,And it is still this way.,18,,
99,0.97,1161.793,1165.297,Very constructively not as loose.,18,,
100,0.97,1165.297,1185.617,"Of the 21.4 million that we are planning to submit, in some cases have already submitted, how many dollars are proposed to be spent in the 2022 budget?",18,,
101,0.97,1185.617,1188.854,Of the 21.4 million those are costs incurred by the city.,19,,
102,0.97,1188.854,1193.025,So we have already spent those dollars.,19,,
103,0.97,1193.025,1205.837,And in 2022 budget we have no evidence to suggest to your going to extend into 2022 and so we don't have those assumed.,19,,
104,0.97,1205.837,1206.338,Thank you.,20,,
105,0.97,1206.338,1218.55,"That's a good question and I think we should move on but I want to make sure though that I did understand and I will look at you, Julie, sorry.",20,,
106,0.97,1218.55,1234.967,I did understand that these are stand alone point in time but 21 is not the total universe it is actually 21 plus 13 plus two plus four?,20,,
107,0.97,1234.967,1235.667,Yes.,21,,
108,0.97,1235.667,1236.535,And it continues.,21,,
109,0.97,1236.535,1242.908,For our contract for vaccines was extended so it will grow.,21,,
110,0.97,1242.908,1251.85,We will look for an updated chart that includes that total column and you explained it well.,22,,
111,0.97,1251.85,1262.527,"We have over 30 slides, I will--35 and I will ask you to keep moving and if there is points of clarification raise your hand and jump in.",22,,
112,0.97,1262.527,1271.803,If there is comments or broader concerns hold that to the end.,22,,
113,0.97,1271.803,1274.473,But feel please plan to interrupt.,22,,
114,0.97,1274.473,1274.64,,23,,
115,0.97,1274.64,1279.778,This was the most complicated part and I appreciate as we get through this.,24,,
116,0.97,1279.778,1290.288,Next we will turn to the Seattle rescue plan summary and I wanted to provide a little bit of overall contact.,24,,
117,0.97,1290.288,1293.291,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda for the introduction.,24,,
118,0.97,1293.291,1294.926,A great summary.,24,,
119,0.97,1294.926,1300.132,The city is receiving 300 million of the $1.9 trillion from the American rescue plan act.,24,,
120,0.97,1300.132,1302.901,This is just our current estimate.,24,,
121,0.97,1302.901,1310.075,And this includes 232 million in local direct aid that is called the Coronavirus local fiscal recovery Fund.,24,,
122,0.97,1310.075,1315.847,Will you hear us refer to that as Clipper in the presentation.,24,,
123,0.97,1315.847,1318.216,I want Tody code that alphabet.,24,,
124,0.97,1318.216,1328.427,We have received aid grants over the course of the year and anticipate more in the future.,24,,
125,0.97,1328.427,1332.864,Because this has been such a big bill and this funding Coughs so much ground.,24,,
126,0.97,1332.864,1348.613,We wanted to cut through that confusion for the public and nest this under the umbrella of the Seattle rescue plan so that if folks are curious how we are spending Federal funding they can Google one thing and they don't have to work for rentals and other things independently.,24,,
127,0.97,1348.613,1370.569,"In the first Seattle rescue plan that we passed earlier this year, $128 million, Clipper, 116, Clipper funds and 12.2 and Seattle plans with $52 million and rental assistance and shuttle support.",24,,
128,0.97,1370.569,1379.644,What you are seeing today and this conversation largely is Seattle rescue plan three.,24,,
129,0.97,1379.644,1388.053,The second branch of Clipper that is another $160 million allocations that is part of the America's 2022 proposed budget.,24,,
130,0.97,1388.053,1396.128,We have updates for Seattle rescue plan one and two and get to itemized plans of what it is.,24,,
131,0.97,1396.128,1396.461,Thank.,25,,
132,0.97,1396.461,1405.937,I want to check the Leftover hand and not a clarification.,25,,
133,0.97,1405.937,1406.171,Great.,25,,
134,0.97,1406.171,1406.671,Please go ahead.,25,,
135,0.97,1406.671,1407.038,Thank you.,26,,
136,0.97,1407.038,1417.616,We have gotten through wonderful recognition for the work we have done in Seattle rescue plan one and I want to take a quick moment to celebrate the progress of where we are.,26,,
137,0.97,1417.616,1428.326,We have shared that we are leaps and bound in terms of planning ahead of most cities in the country.,26,,
138,0.97,1428.326,1430.061,And as a result getting recognition.,26,,
139,0.97,1430.061,1439.671,We have one of the first out of Gates to bring comprehensive plans with project level details from the Brookings institution.,26,,
140,0.97,1439.671,1443.708,A think tank that is highly respected out of D.C. and they do great work.,26,,
141,0.97,1443.708,1456.087,I just want to take this quick moment to celebrate and thank you for indulging.,26,,
142,0.97,1456.087,1456.688,"Move on, please.",26,,
143,0.97,1456.688,1465.897,A little bit on process with Seattle rescue plan one.,26,,
144,0.97,1465.897,1489.688,With Unprecedenting coming to us the Treasury has a complex set of guidelines for the use of Clipper dollars is this a final room and that means that if a regulation that the Treasury uses to tell everyone how to spend the fund or not spend the funds but to address the complexity of how intense the final rule was.,26,,
145,0.97,1489.688,1494.359,There is a review process that spanned over 51 different programs.,26,,
146,0.97,1494.359,1518.049,So through that we have reviewed eligibility to make sure that the spending that we had agreed to in Seattle rescue plan one was eligible and we could produce significant documentation taking to retain the funds long term and there was Rashal equity impact and we developed a racial question process that we ran departments through for each of the programs.,26,,
147,0.97,1518.049,1524.856,We did go program by program on that.,26,,
148,0.97,1524.856,1534.132,Looking for racial equity outcomes and whether the program was advancing opportunities and minimizing harm.,26,,
149,0.97,1534.132,1540.171,"Lastly, as part of this process, we set up performance evaluation.",26,,
150,0.97,1540.171,1551.216,So we are looking to do a comprehensive evaluation plan and as well as programs to look together to look at individual businesses and neighborhoods.,26,,
151,0.97,1551.216,1554.319,Their unique set of needs.,26,,
152,0.97,1554.319,1567.432,We will include quality and quantitative data and aggregate impacts by race that is a quality of the Council.,26,,
153,0.97,1567.432,1568.166,"Next slide, please.",26,,
154,0.97,1568.166,1576.675,Part of the requirements Treasury has implemented is that they are requiring multiple reporting for us.,26,,
155,0.97,1576.675,1609.441,First we have a quarterly project and ex PEP BA sure report and technical report based on what the Treasury provides and the first of these reports I do have have to amend this slide in Realtime because this is due in a little more time that is nice and we have an annual performance plan and we have submitted the first one.,26,,
156,0.97,1609.441,1617.015,You can get to it on either CPO or Seattle rescue plan site and linked here.,26,,
157,0.97,1617.015,1618.049,The public can access that document.,26,,
158,0.97,1618.049,1625.824,And Lastly want to note that city council will receive updates on Seattle rescue plan is October.,26,,
159,0.97,1625.824,1633.798,You will have a lot of visibility moving forward.,26,,
160,0.97,1633.798,1633.999,Okay.,26,,
161,0.97,1633.999,1634.232,Great.,26,,
162,0.97,1634.232,1634.733,On this next slide --,26,,
163,0.97,1634.733,1645.744,I want to take a quick second NOTE the importance of these evaluations and report back thanks to the Council President.,27,,
164,0.97,1645.744,1648.179,Julie and Ben has done and our office.,27,,
165,0.97,1648.179,1658.857,We do that intentionally so the public had a transparent way to ensure that there was accountable use for the dollars.,27,,
166,0.97,1658.857,1669.3,I think it is an almost almost that we included in this year's work on Covid relief.,27,,
167,0.97,1669.3,1675.14,"Just really quickly, appreciate the willingness to do this transparency work.",28,,
168,0.97,1675.14,1719.15,I know the auditor is looking to craft an audit to make sure we are continuing to be accountable in terms of how these are used and I know that a few of us have had an opportunity to meet with Senator Patty Murray and describe to her the approach we are talking around accountability and transparency of the use of these dollars and she was appreciative of that and requested that if there is an opportunity for us to share with her the outcomes and that is helpful to her in ongoing advocacy to continue to allow for directional locations to cities as opposed to having to rely on other agencies.,28,,
169,0.97,1719.15,1733.331,I think it would be helpful to have synergy there and coordinate with our office of Intergovernmental relations.,28,,
170,0.97,1733.331,1734.332,Thank you.,28,,
171,0.97,1734.332,1739.771,We follow up to make that connection.,29,,
172,0.97,1739.771,1740.071,Thank you.,29,,
173,0.97,1740.071,1741.906,On the next slide select highlights from Seattle rescue plan one.,29,,
174,0.97,1741.906,1753.585,"As the chair noted we don't have enough time to get through what we have Pu especially not all we have done so far, going to Emily Alvarado.",29,,
175,0.97,1753.585,1762.26,Thank you chairman Mosqueda and Councilmembers and Julie and Emily Alvarado with the office of housing.,30,,
176,0.97,1762.26,1791.089,As part of Seattle rescue plan one there was $28.5 million allocation for affordable housing capital and that was $12.2 million in home funds and then the other more broader funds and we used those resources to have affordable opportunities through an acquisition under Nofa.,30,,
177,0.97,1791.089,1809.741,We had awards for three initial applications for three brand new under construction buildings totally is 65 units and those units will be opened by the end of the year to provide homes for people that are experiencing homelessness.,30,,
178,0.97,1809.741,1854.953,We have near finalized word to another organization that will secure a short term use for a shelter facility and long term affordable housing redevelopment and this Nofa will continue to roll and that means we are accepting applications and we expect that there are additional applications that we will receive that can bring Online housing quickly and to make the connection here that you will see later to resource it is dependent in part of the next allocation of capital funds to support this strategy.,30,,
179,0.97,1854.953,1862.36,We have immediate housing that has been brought Online.,30,,
180,0.97,1862.36,1864.262,On the cash assistance front.,30,,
181,0.97,1864.262,1868.9,We have been hard at work getting the dollars out the door.,30,,
182,0.97,1868.9,1874.472,There is two phases and the first is Recertification of applications that were submitted.,30,,
183,0.97,1874.472,1885.683,There are about eight million of the 25 allocated and started on August 30th and they have reached approximately 80% of applicants that have been Recertified.,30,,
184,0.97,1885.683,1898.096,Scholarship junkies is who they have contracted with and making phone calls for the remaining 20%.,30,,
185,0.97,1898.096,1902.834,Awards on average is about 1 to $3000.,30,,
186,0.97,1902.834,1906.537,They have disbursed nearly $5 million so far.,30,,
187,0.97,1906.537,1917.215,And phase two is to launch at seat rescue fund application assistance that will go live for October 25th and $15 million available.,30,,
188,0.97,1917.215,1932.263,And there is several community sessions that will receive this on different priority areas with over 42 an community paced organizations to direct this Inapplication language assistance.,30,,
189,0.97,1932.263,1952.75,"Here looking at a similar award size, there is additional funds that will be geared towards contract outreach and then just to make all of that work the additional dollars will go towards program administration.",30,,
190,0.97,1952.75,1953.618,Emily will talk about Sr2 highlights.,30,,
191,0.97,1953.618,1958.489,I want to say thank you to the departments for their innovative work on the cash assistance.,31,,
192,0.97,1958.489,1970.501,There was a lot of cities as you noted that are looking at Seattle how to do the cash assistance to avoid trickle downplay.,31,,
193,0.97,1970.501,2002.533,We wanted to make sure there is cash at hand and started with immigrants and refugees and we built upon the infrastructure created there to get the cash assistance out to phase two and this is exciting work and then we would be Remiss to not mention the child care providers that will be appreciation allotments for those providers that apply on behalf of their employees so that we can impasse that through them.,31,,
194,0.97,2002.533,2020.218,I think huge amount of pride in the work that we have done here to get the dollars out the door and just notes lots of these continue to call upon us in Seattle to see how that was done and something that we are proud of.,31,,
195,0.97,2020.218,2020.518,Questions.,31,,
196,0.97,2020.518,2025.189,"Yes, thank you.",32,,
197,0.97,2025.189,2044.375,I want to ask about the direct assistance we added culture work and artists and wondering how that is being ensured that artists are being done.,32,,
198,0.97,2044.375,2048.679,They worked a lot with the organizations to work towards that.,33,,
199,0.97,2048.679,2054.252,I don't have specifics but we can get more if you would like that.,33,,
200,0.97,2054.252,2057.688,Thanks.,34,,
201,0.97,2057.688,2059.557,I could offer a quick response.,35,,
202,0.97,2059.557,2091.222,"It included arts and culture and when we had those suggestions we included our colleagues and organizations that they contracted with so just to kind of stream line the process, Hsd has taken on those community outreach and application assistance and so we are actually working with those creative folks too.",36,,
203,0.97,2091.222,2094.025,So we are collaborating with multiple departments.,36,,
204,0.97,2094.025,2097.094,Thank you so much.,37,,
205,0.97,2097.094,2097.528,Let's keep going.,37,,
206,0.97,2097.528,2103.134,So with the emergency rental assistance as you recall we received two allocations so far.,38,,
207,0.97,2103.134,2110.041,The first is era one and the second is era two.,38,,
208,0.97,2110.041,2116.581,"For both of these investments as you recall, we created three strategies to deploying resources.",38,,
209,0.97,2116.581,2148.212,The first through United way of King County that was focused on supporting tenants in properties run by small landlords and the second was to support publicly subsidized houses where tenants have the lowest income in the city and the third to be invested in 16 community base os looking at those with expertise serving folks that have higher rates of Covid and higher rates of housing instability.,38,,
210,0.97,2148.212,2161.425,At this point and I am doing what Julie is read numbers not on the slide because the numbers continue to go up.,38,,
211,0.97,2161.425,2164.328,We have obligated 97% of funds.,38,,
212,0.97,2164.328,2166.764,71% are sent which is $16.1 million.,38,,
213,0.97,2166.764,2178.075,And we have started rolling onto the next round of er Afunding to ensure continuous support to community Mecks that are seeking rental assistance.,38,,
214,0.97,2178.075,2186.083,So for the 28 million in Era2 we have now obligated 38% of the funds.,38,,
215,0.97,2186.083,2188.052,And 13% has been sent out.,38,,
216,0.97,2188.052,2225.923,So we will continue to provide updates but I can say I committed to data integrity as part of my presentation yesterday so I will get into that for one second while we continue to crunch the numbers we can see that at least half of our households that reported racial data in all programs are Bypock and we see 39% of households and roughly 40% of households with United way of King County are families with children.,38,,
217,0.97,2225.923,2233.564,I know those are particular interest areas of both so we will continue to track that.,38,,
218,0.97,2233.564,2242.607,Emily let me see if I can break that down.,39,,
219,0.97,2242.607,2245.676,"When we look at Era2, the recovery act.",39,,
220,0.97,2245.676,2246.978,The emergency rental assistance act.,39,,
221,0.97,2246.978,2284.181,So we did this at the beginning of Covid and earlier this Spring/Getting in to summer and folks remember that we had something that was going to housing and United way Ofki County and what we did in this last round of rental assistance we made sure that community organizations that really have roots in communities with higher risk of displace many and highest risk of economic instability and possibly losing their home without assistant we included funding equitably for those organizations.,39,,
222,0.97,2284.181,2298.829,"13% have been sent by United way and the community organizations, that means people have applied and they have gotten checked out to those landlords directly so people have assurances that their rent is being paid.",39,,
223,0.97,2298.829,2301.932,Is that a way to explain it?,39,,
224,0.97,2301.932,2302.199,Yes.,40,,
225,0.97,2302.199,2306.003,"Let me, I should define some of these terms.",40,,
226,0.97,2306.003,2306.337,I apologize.,40,,
227,0.97,2306.337,2315.479,If we look at er A1 in which we are completing expense BA sure obligated means it is either contract or it is spent.,40,,
228,0.97,2315.479,2325.456,"So we had the three strategies, United way has spent their desire $8 million allocating.",40,,
229,0.97,2325.456,2330.294,Publicly subsidized affordable housing providers have spent $7 million allocation.,40,,
230,0.97,2330.294,2339.236,And then the 6-Point something million allocation that went to Cpos is all under contract with the agencies.,40,,
231,0.97,2339.236,2346.277,They are currently working with tenants in communities and they build up on an ongoing basis.,40,,
232,0.97,2346.277,2362.093,"The difference between the 67% largely and the 93 percent you see up there, is us awaiting invoices from the community organizations that are currently working with community members.",40,,
233,0.97,2362.093,2376.273,Because United way and the publicly subsidized affordable housing providers have sent down their first batch of money they are moving to the second Trunch or are under contract.,40,,
234,0.97,2376.273,2404.201,"The public service announcement, if you are a Renter or if you are a small landlord and you need assistance with payment, rent or receiving the rent that you are owed, there are dollars available and we have that information on the office of housing Website and we have put it out in our new letters too and want to make sure that Renters know that money is available and there's money to be had.",41,,
235,0.97,2404.201,2405.202,Great.,42,,
236,0.97,2405.202,2405.936,Thank you.,42,,
237,0.97,2405.936,2428.325,"I was excited to talk about cash assistance I am Tonya Kim acting director of the human services Department and all reference, the next portion on this same slide for the older Americans Act and so we are budgeting for 2.8 million in the older Americans act funds in 2021 for a total of 7.7 million.",43,,
238,0.97,2428.325,2435.065,We are still waiting from the state for a final plan.,43,,
239,0.97,2435.065,2460.624,The primary goal of the older Americans act fund is to provide relief to our current funded contractors and that is to meet the service demands as well as maintain and scale existing Covid relief efforts that includes alleviating negative health effects of social isolation.,43,,
240,0.97,2460.624,2481.812,We have identified priorities for spending that will include older abuse case management and transit fare subsidy program and care counseling and nutrition as well as ads capacity to support the overall efforts and to have service capacity for our providers as well.,43,,
241,0.97,2481.812,2502.099,The aging disability that serves as our area agency on aging is focusing on the new allowable expenditures aimed Atalleviating negative health effects because of long term recommendations.,43,,
242,0.97,2502.099,2518.215,They are focused on cognitive health and the inter discipline program called capable designed for older adults to age in place.,43,,
243,0.97,2518.215,2521.252,I believe next is Ben.,43,,
244,0.97,2521.252,2524.221,We have a question.,44,,
245,0.97,2524.221,2525.589,Sure.,45,,
246,0.97,2525.589,2532.997,"We, the council passed 120150 that appropriated some of those funds from the older Americans act.",45,,
247,0.97,2532.997,2548.412,"It included a proviso that required 200,000 to be spent on services to address the mental health impacts of senior isolation.",45,,
248,0.97,2548.412,2553.417,I don't recall receiving a spending plan per the request to do so.,45,,
249,0.97,2553.417,2598.495,"I understand there is some information for central staff in the last few days via the budget Q and A. if I'm reading it correctly it shows that there were two investments totaling $94,000 and that was less than half of what was required by the proviso and unless there's some information I don't have, I am disappointed in acting on the Council's direction via legislative intent to support seniors through the mental health impacts of senior isolation that I understand is allowable use of Ooo funds.",45,,
250,0.97,2598.495,2601.165,I am monitoring my colleagues that are typing a response.,46,,
251,0.97,2601.165,2602.933,We will need to get back to you.,46,,
252,0.97,2602.933,2603.233,Thank you.,46,,
253,0.97,2603.233,2641.038,"I just want to point out I reached out many times about the intention how we planned to spend the funds and partner with Hsd on engagement activities with some of the providers to find out what the highest priority needs were and I understand the Department may not have had time to partner but I expected the 200,000 for the purpose would be spent for this purpose.",47,,
254,0.97,2644.108,2644.875,Thank you.,48,,
255,0.97,2644.875,2646.91,And we will get back to you.,48,,
256,0.97,2646.91,2675.672,We appreciate that comments from your office and have had that top of mind much of the spending out of this plant is out of the city's control as it is directed by the state so we have been holding that in the forefront and will get back with you.,48,,
257,0.97,2675.672,2677.841,Thank you.,49,,
258,0.97,2677.841,2687.217,"The second Trunch of the Clipper dollars, I will give a quick overview and turn it over to Julie with more details.",50,,
259,0.97,2687.217,2712.242,As we move to the second Trunch I think you will see it was our perspective that we are striking a slightly different balance between the need for immediate aid and shifting towards recovery and the opportunity to use substantial sum of money of one time money to make long term investments as well.,50,,
260,0.97,2712.242,2721.185,It includes the longer term and the most obvious almost of that was on affordable housing.,50,,
261,0.97,2721.185,2744.775,$50 million of the 116 available in the second Trunch dedicated to affordable housing as I scrubbed where affordable housing is in desperately short fly clearly an opportunity to invest and help address immediate needs and to make change as well.,50,,
262,0.97,2744.775,2756.286,"And also economic stimulus, it will take workers to build the Housers and the context of being one time funding it is not creating a Byway with a new program.",50,,
263,0.97,2756.286,2770.0,That is certainly a new focus for our Federal dollars and you can make sense in that current context.,50,,
264,0.97,2770.0,2792.022,A focus on sustaining some of the work and helping those more vulnerable that are experiencing homelessness and recognizing the current crisis and the Federal funding that offering relief won't be available or will not last indefinitely and the Federal funding won't be available.,50,,
265,0.97,2792.022,2806.036,Beginning to look how to transition away from the Federal funding and to learn some of the lessons and make the changes in the system permanent and also Reverting to some previous approaches as well.,50,,
266,0.97,2806.036,2824.321,And then last on the economic side the focus on inclusion under the targeting of those with most affected and also looking to the longer run where you will see an increased deficit on work force development and cash relief for businesses although there is some of that as well.,50,,
267,0.97,2824.321,2836.833,That was the overall perspective and Julie will have more details and more about the process.,50,,
268,0.97,2836.833,2838.335,"Thanks, Ben.",51,,
269,0.97,2838.335,2843.707,"If we can go to the next slide, please.",51,,
270,0.97,2843.707,2864.628,We have on the screen a summary of the Seattle rescue plan three package and looking at investments nearly 73 million in housing and homelessness and 18.3 in recovery and 18.6 million in supporting city workers and reopening.,51,,
271,0.97,2864.628,2875.806,As Councilmember Herbold noted in Seattle rescue plan one has three items that you outlined your in tent to what you would hope to see.,51,,
272,0.97,2875.806,2882.079,This was affordable housing capital goal of $60 million that we have achieved in this package.,51,,
273,0.97,2882.079,2892.289,"The second was to spend future funding, not necessarily in this space but in any space on trying to keep moving streets permanent.",51,,
274,0.97,2892.289,2899.196,And we have been known on the top and on the Federal infrastructure bill that will have funding dedicated to that once it passes.,51,,
275,0.97,2899.196,2905.469,And then the third item was the one that Councilmember Herbold spoke to on older Americans.,51,,
276,0.97,2905.469,2914.711,And with that talking about racial equity and how that is incorporated in our package.,51,,
277,0.97,2914.711,2945.776,So we wanted to focus on the Seattle rescue plan three follows the path we have laid down with the Council and executive and the external processes in developing Seattle rescue plan one and the analysis that the program did on a program by program evaluation that they submitted to us as part of the process that we set up and also the equitable community initiative Unrely Og that analysis that was community feedback through the process as well.,51,,
278,0.97,2945.776,2961.191,The core tenant of these funds is all of the guidance is helping those most harmed by the pandemic so that is at the Federal level in every document.,51,,
279,0.97,2961.191,2970.901,"Here continuing that, and we are targeting groups that affected by Covid-19 and to groups.",51,,
280,0.97,2970.901,2977.841,And those groups Unfortunately are disproportionately Bypocks because it has exacerbated historical inequities.,51,,
281,0.97,2977.841,2988.418,I won't go through everything here because we will two in more detail coming up.,51,,
282,0.97,2988.418,2994.925,So you have heard about a lot of these programs in the course of the work in the presentations and we will cover them here.,51,,
283,0.97,2994.925,3009.873,We won't go in as much detail that you heard be in the presentations but we will show you so you can see the full package.,51,,
284,0.97,3009.873,3015.612,Housing and homelessness at 72.8 million and Emily you will take it from here.,51,,
285,0.97,3015.612,3016.413,Thank you.,52,,
286,0.97,3016.413,3016.713,Next slide.,52,,
287,0.97,3016.713,3038.168,So $50 million here are allocated to affordable housing capital and as I described yesterday the capital can be imagined as being delivered through existing profits to meet a growing need and demand for affordable housing development and acquisition and preservation.,52,,
288,0.97,3038.168,3046.076,We imagine that funds can be extended either through the annual notice of funds available.,52,,
289,0.97,3046.076,3059.79,We have one hundred million request for our Nova and that serves a range of population and with a range of priority including addressing homelessness and advancing equitable development.,52,,
290,0.97,3059.79,3074.938,We could imagine that some of the resources as I said earlier goes to supplement the Nova to ensure additional opportunities to secure buildings under construction we have the ability to do so.,52,,
291,0.97,3074.938,3102.099,So this will be an general capital source to us that helps to allow us to fund more projects that we know are waiting for resources in the pipeline and new buildings that we know we can bring on to address the homelessness crisis.,52,,
292,0.97,3102.099,3102.365,Okay.,53,,
293,0.97,3102.365,3105.202,So back to the human services Department.,53,,
294,0.97,3105.202,3115.345,Test Colby gave a brilliant presentation with others for the city homelessness wise presentation another day.,53,,
295,0.97,3115.345,3129.226,But as a reminder specific to these funds there is funds for emergency shelters to be implemented by the King County regional homelessness authority that Hs D will be contracting with.,53,,
296,0.97,3129.226,3137.234,This includes one year ramp down funding for Covid mitigation in shelters.,53,,
297,0.97,3137.234,3138.068,At about 3.7 million.,53,,
298,0.97,3138.068,3167.33,So the changes made during the the expansion of beds and enhance Disin infection protocols and allows shelters to keep clients safe and prevent the spread of Covid-19 throughout the year.,53,,
299,0.97,3167.33,3178.275,"The second is maintaining salvation Army Soto enhanced shelter units, 23 units at 12 million.",53,,
300,0.97,3178.275,3190.253,There was City Hall and King County administration building and 4TH and Jackson were combined and converted to a single Noncongregant enhanced shelter in Soto.,53,,
301,0.97,3190.253,3202.299,This will maintain the 241 shelter units and the current format at the new location when the Soto site closes in September of 2022.,53,,
302,0.97,3202.299,3207.07,There are two million for Start- up funding approximately.,53,,
303,0.97,3207.07,3214.11,"And that is operations, maintenance, services, et cetera.",53,,
304,0.97,3214.11,3227.557,So the last is to maintain the Kro end Maned shelter units 125 at 6.6 million and that is an estimate that includes approximately three years of operations.,53,,
305,0.97,3227.557,3262.092,"And you can see the description here of the additional prior Covid, $19 here that was in the first allocation of 18.7 million diversion capacity building and outreach shelter and rapid Rehousing and safe lives and safe storage and tiny homes and villages.",53,,
306,0.97,3262.092,3262.792,Recovery 18.3 million here.,53,,
307,0.97,3262.792,3265.595,And we will go to the details.,53,,
308,0.97,3265.595,3274.571,"The small business ownership fund that will go to the economic development, 7.6 million.",53,,
309,0.97,3274.571,3275.372,This funding would go through 2023.,53,,
310,0.97,3275.372,3289.753,And this is targeted at the ration of a small business ownership fund to finance small businesses to acquire ground floor commercial space and provide a public benefit.,53,,
311,0.97,3289.753,3292.656,In Congress to renting that.,53,,
312,0.97,3292.656,3313.009,We have partnership with the CDI National economic Council for a grant to fund small businesses and planning to Prioritize assistance to villages and high displace many areas.,54,,
313,0.97,3313.009,3358.088,"We have that on our index and Seattle 2035 growth analysis and it is worth noting that we do have to, as we did I in the first package, this is one of those programs that is not directly eligible for clipper so we do have to do a funding site to F0 next a workforce development package and this actually represents investments across a number of city departments.",54,,
314,0.97,3358.088,3359.422,"Oh, it looks like we left off the duration.",54,,
315,0.97,3359.422,3359.656,Sorry.,54,,
316,0.97,3359.656,3362.325,"I will get that you duration, sorry.",54,,
317,0.97,3362.325,3363.893,It's not on the slide.,54,,
318,0.97,3363.893,3382.612,"What we are trying to do on the package is create strong pathways to middle wage jobs and our data will show us will thrive in the future, and these investments and economic inclusion will help us to recover from the pandemic and continue equitable growth.",54,,
319,0.97,3382.612,3388.785,These items will be funded also in the same way with revenue replacement.,54,,
320,0.97,3388.785,3406.636,"Here, the guidance doesn't specifically allow for economic development although we know that is key as Ben noble mentioned, and the recovery economic development phase.",54,,
321,0.97,3406.636,3424.754,"The individual workforce investment items are individual artist relief and workforce development arts for $1.5 million, priority hire FAS for $500,000, and Maritime workforce development for $500,000.",54,,
322,0.97,3424.754,3446.276,"Affordable housing and homeless service providers workforce that you heard director Alvarado speak about for $750,000, and Re-Employment pathways for immigrant families or Rev juice, rather, for $250,000 and clean energy Pre- apprenticeship scholarships for $1 million.",54,,
323,0.97,3446.276,3451.08,"Next item, please.",54,,
324,0.97,3451.08,3453.383,And I think Ben will pick up this one.,54,,
325,0.97,3453.383,3453.683,Sorry.,55,,
326,0.97,3453.683,3456.352,I was on mute.,55,,
327,0.97,3456.352,3458.388,Already touched on this in a couple of forums.,55,,
328,0.97,3458.388,3478.174,"And we will continue with the clean city initiative funding that we had, and you can see the last point there, it was almost six million in the Crf appropriation that will carry us to December for this work.",55,,
329,0.97,3478.174,3488.785,"As has been noted, this is sufficient funding, and the full description here of the items, again, I think the Councilmembers are familiar with and you can read.",55,,
330,0.97,3488.785,3499.863,"And this takes us through August when we are obviously with a number of questions whether that will be sufficient or not, and I think that is a fair question.",55,,
331,0.97,3499.863,3515.712,"Again, as we are putting the budget together we had relative more confidence than we do now about the Timeline for the pandemic itself, perhaps, and the other side of this is that we know the uncertainty has been the name of the game here.",55,,
332,0.97,3515.712,3524.854,So the thought was this is something that we could Re- evaluate mid year next year and determine whether or not additional funding would be needed.,55,,
333,0.97,3524.854,3529.259,I would not be Disputing the conclusion that you can already make that judgment.,55,,
334,0.97,3529.259,3530.226,But that is now in your hands.,55,,
335,0.97,3530.226,3532.462,So that's really the story here again.,55,,
336,0.97,3532.462,3542.272,"We talked about this already so I think without, you know--next slide.",55,,
337,0.97,3542.272,3551.948,"So there are a number O█F investments that we have grouped in the category called community well being, and it's probably more useful to see the individual items.",55,,
338,0.97,3551.948,3552.248,Next slide.,55,,
339,0.97,3552.248,3556.586,So one of those is child care stabilization.,55,,
340,0.97,3556.586,3561.324,This is one I think we need to think about on the economic recovery side as well.,55,,
341,0.97,3561.324,3571.634,"As I said the other day, we are not going to get folks back on work unless the child care system is up and running.",55,,
342,0.97,3571.634,3574.437,And it continues to face challenges.,55,,
343,0.97,3574.437,3586.316,I know firsthand challenges but not sharing teachers across classrooms B shutdowns associated with positive tests and the like.,55,,
344,0.97,3586.316,3595.925,So $2.4 million to provide financial support to licensed child care providers and then to family spending neighborhood providers.,55,,
345,0.97,3595.925,3597.827,So this is consistent with funding.,55,,
346,0.97,3597.827,3602.398,"You can see the last below, consistent with the child funding we provided before.",55,,
347,0.97,3602.398,3626.389,"Given that many child care facilities are now open and running and overall financial constraints but the overall level of funding is lower than in the past, and this is not an area that we can neglect and will require ongoing support.",55,,
348,0.97,3626.389,3626.856,Next slide.,55,,
349,0.97,3626.856,3628.057,A quick question.,56,,
350,0.97,3628.057,3628.358,Yeah.,57,,
351,0.97,3628.358,3652.315,"On the family, friend, and neighbor investments for providers there, as you know, we did this--invest this incentive program we put in after a lot of conversation with child care providers and Adco advocates.",58,,
352,0.97,3652.315,3670.266,"But can you tell me how the specifics to friends and neighborhood investments, how we are getting to the goal of making it so the folks are actually receiving the funds?",58,,
353,0.97,3670.266,3676.472,I am going to turn that implementation and I don't know if anyone on the line has the detail.,59,,
354,0.97,3676.472,3680.71,If not we can get back to you on where we stand.,59,,
355,0.97,3680.71,3682.078,You can get back to me.,60,,
356,0.97,3682.078,3688.618,I think the biggest question is how does the investment for number two tier compare to number one?,60,,
357,0.97,3688.618,3706.269,And basically just to continue the support that we heard for the child care facilities themselves and a similar process with the folks who have been awarded dollars today but again we'll get back to the implementation questions.,61,,
358,0.97,3706.269,3706.536,Okay.,62,,
359,0.97,3706.536,3706.836,Thank you.,62,,
360,0.97,3706.836,3710.106,Okay.,63,,
361,0.97,3710.106,3710.54,Next slide.,63,,
362,0.97,3710.54,3720.75,So this slide is the human services Department's focusing on food.,64,,
363,0.97,3720.75,3746.642,"And so for the did duration is 2022 and ramp down the Covid 19- related food support programs back to the previous level and baseline numbers, and Hsd intends to utilize the funding from grocery bags and meals for housing and emergency shelters and food banks throughout the year.",64,,
364,0.97,3746.642,3756.018,You can see the previous amount was 8.8 would have the base.,64,,
365,0.97,3756.018,3758.087,Thank you so much.,65,,
366,0.97,3758.087,3760.723,The next item is affordable Seattle unified portal.,65,,
367,0.97,3760.723,3765.862,This is something that is not new to the Councilmembers.,65,,
368,0.97,3765.862,3766.462,This was previously included.,65,,
369,0.97,3766.462,3769.132,I am so sorry.,66,,
370,0.97,3769.132,3774.07,"We have gone through that, but I see Councilmember Herbold.",66,,
371,0.97,3774.07,3774.47,Please go ahead.,66,,
372,0.97,3774.47,3778.441,And you were Pausing for me and everything.,67,,
373,0.97,3778.441,3790.086,The slide says transition but I'm interpreting this as potentially Ramping down and ending from pandemic food support.,67,,
374,0.97,3790.086,3791.187,Is that right?,67,,
375,0.97,3791.187,3792.922,It is.,68,,
376,0.97,3792.922,3805.868,So is this choice driven by and observed pie by a drop in need or demand or represent a net decrease in support?,69,,
377,0.97,3805.868,3818.648,I think it's more about other funds versus coming Online and looking at the state and the county and seeing the distribution of that throughout the state.,70,,
378,0.97,3818.648,3848.511,"So it was super helpful for more detail about those assumptions and the numbers of people that we are projecting will be served by those new programs through the state and, you know, for comparing that to the number of people we've been serving through our program.",71,,
379,0.97,3848.511,3848.711,Noted.,72,,
380,0.97,3849.011,3850.112,"Oh, I'm so sorry.",73,,
381,0.97,3851.948,3853.583,I missed a hand.,73,,
382,0.97,3853.583,3864.994,"So on the unified portal, so what we're trying to do here is create a single portal where residents can learn about city programs.",73,,
383,0.97,3864.994,3870.399,This would make the economic impact because it would remove the barrier to focus the access to the programs.,73,,
384,0.97,3870.399,3878.307,"Currently, we have--I couldn't even tell you how many programs that folks have to access through different Venues.",73,,
385,0.97,3878.307,3889.118,"Someone wanted to access funding in parks and in DOM, they would have to contact those departments separately.",73,,
386,0.97,3889.118,3904.767,"What we are trying to do is have one place where folks can go and enter the information one time, and it will tell them what they are eligible for and benefit from the city and share their information with those departments.",73,,
387,0.97,3904.767,3910.239,It would access the education fees and application all in one.,73,,
388,0.97,3910.239,3938.067,"So there are multiple components with this item in IC to be able to have the back end technical assistance put up, and the Qa/Qc is quality insurance and quality control, sorry I did not spell that out and innovation and performance to look across the programs and find a way to stream line.",73,,
389,0.97,3938.067,3938.267,Next.,73,,
390,0.97,3938.267,3940.536,Additional support for Seattle promise.,73,,
391,0.97,3940.536,3957.553,"In the first bill, we included $4 million for Seattle's promise, and 6.7 to additional programs through 2023.",73,,
392,0.97,3957.553,3978.541,"As Councilmembers know and you heard from director Chappell earlier that they are more likely to get separated in education and less likely to come back, and these resources are to help engage in education and we are looking at enhanced programming support for the programs added in 2021 to get to a total of 10.7 over allocation.",73,,
393,0.97,3978.541,3982.278,And the specific efforts would be below.,73,,
394,0.97,3982.278,4026.622,"So addressing the impacts on students during Covid and to support new partnerships for the University of Washington with extended tuition and programs and offering additional college preparation and Persistences support for recent public high school graduates and particularly for students of recall as I mentioned, and bolster promise scholar programs through the University of Washington and addressing educational equities with three out comes, student preparation for College-Level Coursework and retention in college and completion of certificate credential or degree to transfer to a Four- year institution.",73,,
395,0.97,4026.622,4056.786,"It's a Step-Down of the funding, a sustain funding in 2022, at the current levels and less funding in '23 and recognizing that the high school and college students dealing with remote learning, some of the impact would have faded by then, and then the conversation indicated that some discussion could be had in '23 and what elements would be sustained and bear to do so.",74,,
396,0.97,4056.786,4063.859,It's a couple of years of funding but it anticipates a ramp down of some level.,74,,
397,0.97,4063.859,4069.899,"Thank you so much, Ben.",75,,
398,0.97,4069.899,4070.199,Next slide.,75,,
399,0.97,4070.199,4074.336,"So in our last category, and thank you for hanging in with us.",75,,
400,0.97,4074.336,4076.906,I know this is long.,75,,
401,0.97,4076.906,4080.209,The last category is supporting city workers and reopening.,75,,
402,0.97,4080.209,4084.58,As we know to make the programs work we have to have the people in the city to run them.,75,,
403,0.97,4084.58,4088.551,We are looking at the Federal funds evaluation.,75,,
404,0.97,4088.551,4094.023,We spoke about this at the top and it's a continuation program.,75,,
405,0.97,4094.023,4106.635,And we are providing three years of funding to support the measurement and evaluation effort to look at the impacts of the city's recovery investment.,75,,
406,0.97,4106.635,4114.41,We're Prioritizing racial equity in our strategy and we're identifying best practices for the impact of our investment.,75,,
407,0.97,4114.41,4118.481,We are looking to establish citywide best practices for aggregating data.,75,,
408,0.97,4118.481,4132.394,So what you're hearing from me is not just trying to learn about the program s but how do we really extend the lines throughout the city and Embed the body of work throughout?,75,,
409,0.97,4132.394,4144.173,The individuals hired with these plans also are responsible for doing the reporting to the Feds as well.,75,,
410,0.97,4144.173,4144.473,Next slide.,75,,
411,0.97,4144.473,4154.55,Another significant element of overall funding request is for staffing to help track the implementation of the Federal money and reporting back to the Federal Government itself.,76,,
412,0.97,4154.55,4173.002,"I note that the funding is to cover as many as three years' worth of funding in '22, '23, and '24 because that's the period in which the Federal dollars are eligible to be spent and need to be reported throughout.",76,,
413,0.97,4173.002,4177.339,It may seem like a large dollar amount and it covers funding for three years.,76,,
414,0.97,4177.339,4180.576,We're looking for staff in the budget office.,76,,
415,0.97,4180.576,4196.225,"We are to be held accountable for holding the money, to be believable for the money and at FAS, we are producing the reports to provide to the Federal Government and a bit at OEM as well.",76,,
416,0.97,4196.225,4198.294,They have a bit of a role in this.,76,,
417,0.97,4198.294,4206.202,"And again, we have been getting Kudos at the national level for having moved quickly on implementing this.",76,,
418,0.97,4206.202,4213.976,We know in discussions with the Federal Government this is one of the things they expected the money to be used for.,76,,
419,0.97,4213.976,4216.812,They recognized the reporting requirements are significant.,76,,
420,0.97,4216.812,4222.117,It's an important piece and not a bit of a background but more on the ground impact.,76,,
421,0.97,4222.117,4236.365,We can't get the on the ground impact if we are not following through with this reporting that is required and ensuring this implementation is happening.,76,,
422,0.97,4236.365,4236.665,Next slide.,76,,
423,0.97,4236.665,4242.404,Related piece supporting the city staff and our current hybrid environment.,76,,
424,0.97,4242.404,4255.184,So this--the current arrangement puts stress on the key Department and I.T.,76,,
425,0.97,4255.184,4257.252,System and staff to respond to technical issues.,76,,
426,0.97,4257.252,4266.328,"The team slows down and you can't log down with the computers, all those kind of things.",76,,
427,0.97,4266.328,4282.011,And less customer focus but essential work around Cybersecurity and all of us tapping into the city system remotely to inherently Heightens the risks.,76,,
428,0.97,4282.011,4282.578,The next slide is related.,76,,
429,0.97,4282.578,4291.82,The software and the human touched on on I.T.,76,,
430,0.97,4291.82,4297.593,On the hardware side with a fundamental shift on the approach about computers on the particular.,76,,
431,0.97,4297.593,4309.338,"So, in general we had a whole system of desktop computer replacement, recycled five years on those.",76,,
432,0.97,4309.338,4318.647,So what we've realized it probably makes more sense to replace the computers and promote and facilitate hybrid work.,76,,
433,0.97,4318.647,4322.051,They're more costly.,76,,
434,0.97,4322.051,4324.753,The funding systems weren't anticipating this shift.,76,,
435,0.97,4324.753,4333.028,So it's a bit of an increment to help us to pay the additional costs to move towards ever more laptops across the city.,76,,
436,0.97,4333.028,4348.11,"That's another critical piece of keeping this work going and every expectation of the hybrid work environment which will be the future of some share, significant share of the city's workforce.",76,,
437,0.97,4348.11,4348.41,Next slide.,76,,
438,0.97,4348.41,4378.507,"Oh, so with the vaccine mandate now in place, there is some extent to implementing that and ensuring that everyone is, in fact, properly Vaccinated, and there is ongoing work on that as well, and small funding for that and things we need to keep the city operating.",76,,
439,0.97,4378.507,4378.874,The next slide.,76,,
440,0.97,4378.874,4381.677,"I think--Oh, thank you.",76,,
441,0.97,4381.677,4384.213,I'll take this one.,77,,
442,0.97,4384.213,4396.725,"There is a lot of uncertainty moving forward, and we are looking to establish $2 million and if you remember the discussions, we discussed a much larger reserve, a fund.",77,,
443,0.97,4396.725,4414.109,"Now that we know more that we are doing quite well with the reimbursements, we think we can more responsibly lower the total to $2 million for items that are not FEMA eligible.",77,,
444,0.97,4414.109,4431.894,"We have the spending and associated revenue into the forefront but there will be things that aren't eligible, and we have already incurred the costs as a necessary expense for the pandemic but for whatever reason they were not eligible for FEMA.",77,,
445,0.97,4431.894,4434.329,"Believe it or not, we have reached one more slide after this.",77,,
446,0.97,4434.329,4437.166,So just high level.,77,,
447,0.97,4437.166,4440.669,So what you have are all these check marks.,77,,
448,0.97,4440.669,4446.341,So the American rescue plan act we have received the Clipper dollars.,77,,
449,0.97,4446.341,4455.851,"And this is the final--proposed final allocation for those, and the other grants we have allocated elsewhere.",77,,
450,0.97,4455.851,4465.894,We fully anticipate additional resources just coming in through the state or county pass Throughs.,77,,
451,0.97,4465.894,4470.165,The amount and timing for those will be determined.,77,,
452,0.97,4470.165,4477.573,Additional resources will be under determination at the Feds.,77,,
453,0.97,4477.573,4486.181,"The build become BART act, we are looking at huge sums of money covering a wide array of possible investments.",77,,
454,0.97,4486.181,4490.285,And we will have more as we learn more.,77,,
455,0.97,4490.285,4493.689,What questions can we answer for you?,77,,
456,0.97,4493.689,4497.025,Thank you very much for your in-depth presentation today.,78,,
457,0.97,4497.025,4500.963,I will jump in because I don't see any hands up here.,78,,
458,0.97,4500.963,4511.54,The first question I have in looking at the investments in I.T.,78,,
459,0.97,4511.54,4533.395,"And the precious resources for the recovery Act and congressional partners trying to Prioritize the funding for system services, Chicago that you are hopeful in the infrastructure bill that would help with the city infrastructure like hardware, upgrades?",78,,
460,0.97,4533.395,4534.496,I was going to say the same thing.,79,,
461,0.97,4534.496,4540.502,I heard it's a focus on Internet access for the public.,79,,
462,0.97,4540.502,4549.945,"But I think the focus, the assistance for the city's operations we have to assume is in these dollars.",79,,
463,0.97,4549.945,4554.249,"Thank you, and I am trying to find the slide--here we go.",80,,
464,0.97,4554.249,4557.986,Slide number 17 related to emergency services.,80,,
465,0.97,4557.986,4576.505,"So part of our conversation yesterday, one of the questions that I didn't get the chance to ask of the pretty large panel there was related to the type of shelter and I am not sure if this is the most appropriate, director but you are probably the most connected to this question.",80,,
466,0.97,4576.505,4624.486,"Part of the reason that I think we have so much visible trauma in the streets and especially downtown is related to the Nmber of high need, people who lost housing at the beginning of the pandemic, housing, shelter options, providing 500 beds and provide care to high need people with mental health and addition, and some of the people that they serve go to Renton.",80,,
467,0.97,4624.486,4638.433,"A lot of the reason that we continue to see people living outside the Encampments with very high needs with behavioral and mental health issues is because of a number of those, over 400 beds were shut down.",80,,
468,0.97,4638.433,4653.815,"I understand they are on track to potentially open up 350 or so beds in Seattle for the high needs patients from Defc, patients?",80,,
469,0.97,4653.815,4656.852,"Excuse me, people from Defc mans, and that's great.",80,,
470,0.97,4656.852,4670.365,I'm glad to hear we're going from 93 beds to 350 but that's still a net loss of 150 high acute beds and units for the people that Defc served.,80,,
471,0.97,4670.365,4695.991,"You can tell me, a, when we talked yesterday, can you tell me about the number of beds that we are actually talking about opening and why on the first bullet are we talking about Ramping down funding for hotel services and perhaps this bullet and correspond.",80,,
472,0.97,4695.991,4706.435,But we did at some point talk over the last three days about the hotel services shuttering.,80,,
473,0.97,4706.435,4715.811,And I'm really concerned that is not the same strategy that I am hearing from our King County partners who are trying to open more hotel services.,80,,
474,0.97,4715.811,4718.547,I am we are all growing in the same direction here.,80,,
475,0.97,4718.547,4741.169,We are all committed to the regional growth and we have a long way to expand this out but I am concerned about the beds that are open and why we are shut anything hotel services before we have an alternative safe place to go.,80,,
476,0.97,4741.169,4742.137,"It's okay, director, I --",81,,
477,0.97,4742.137,4744.406,I am --,82,,
478,0.97,4744.406,4746.241,Is that you?,83,,
479,0.97,4746.241,4750.078,Do you need Intel from Julie?,83,,
480,0.97,4750.078,4753.381,But that's my biggest concern.,83,,
481,0.97,4753.381,4761.056,These are High-Acute needs people who are not well served in just a roof or a door.,83,,
482,0.97,4761.056,4766.394,So there's people that we know who need mental health services and we haven't opened the doors for.,83,,
483,0.97,4766.394,4778.373,And then there is additional people we shelter in hotels which I am thankful for but I don't want to see us shutter any of the hotels in the moment that we are still trying to recover.,83,,
484,0.97,4778.373,4782.677,There are two distinct populations of those living unsheltered.,83,,
485,0.97,4782.677,4786.281,I am worried about both of those issues.,83,,
486,0.97,4786.281,4787.916,You can follow up as needed.,83,,
487,0.97,4787.916,4792.42,I am not an expert in the subject matter and I won't weigh in.,84,,
488,0.97,4792.42,4798.393,"And Julia, I don't know if she has the answers or she can get you more details.",84,,
489,0.97,4798.393,4806.401,And we will have mark with us in the discussion.,85,,
490,0.97,4806.401,4818.313,"And director, I appreciate this is not an easy answer but part of our follow-up questions as well.",86,,
491,0.97,4818.313,4826.454,Can you tell me about the one- year ramp down funding for Covid mitigation shelters?,86,,
492,0.97,4826.454,4829.558,What does that entail?,86,,
493,0.97,4829.558,4830.225,That is a good question.,87,,
494,0.97,4830.225,4838.066,I don't have the details.,87,,
495,0.97,4838.066,4845.907,"Julie do, you have the information?",87,,
496,0.97,4845.907,4846.174,Yeah.,88,,
497,0.97,4846.174,4864.092,"As a result of the measures, you know, if we spread out a program on multiple sites to Úprovide additional spacing for folks staying there, you have suddenly twice the cost to run the shelter.",88,,
498,0.97,4864.092,4897.359,"You had to have twice the number there to support the people that are staying there, and so these programs, we are trying to extend this another year, and these increments of the housing--I'm sorry, the individual durations of the items is intended to be a step down to transition out of our one-time funding and on to potentially new or different funding in the future without it all hitting the general fund all at once.",88,,
499,0.97,4897.359,4899.861,Computers should be in one year pretty significance.,88,,
500,0.97,4899.861,4914.342,"We are doing a ramp down in one year from the first one and the Salvation Army and Sodo, two years of funding, and for Keiro, that is three years of funding.",88,,
501,0.97,4914.342,4919.781,So we can discuss a smaller implement and say are these still needed in the future?,88,,
502,0.97,4919.781,4924.753,And we can have a discussion at that time.,88,,
503,0.97,4924.753,4929.791,"Real quick, to emphasize the point.",89,,
504,0.97,4929.791,4930.659,These are one-time Federal resources.,89,,
505,0.97,4930.659,4934.462,"As Julie described, the time frame is not the same for all the elements.",89,,
506,0.97,4934.462,4944.172,This is one year and extend the full 3.7 next year.,89,,
507,0.97,4944.172,4962.657,"It will have to be from another source going forward, a 2023 situation, and the Salvation Army, it's a one-time funding but extend it over two years, six million a year but we expect to be maintaining that shelter into 2023.",89,,
508,0.97,4962.657,4969.064,And that will raise the same funding question come 2024.,89,,
509,0.97,4969.064,4990.452,"These are not all with 2023 even though the cliff comes at the end of 2024, and the response to Covid, specifically, we'll know more about the pandemic and epidemic are in the next year and the year following.",89,,
510,0.97,4990.452,5000.929,"The strategy about?, if you will, Meting out the money, and the uncertainty, it remains the name of the game.",89,,
511,0.97,5000.929,5002.263,I'm sorry if I went quickly.,90,,
512,0.97,5002.263,5008.503,Did you have a question about specifically what would be included in the mitigation or shelter?,90,,
513,0.97,5008.503,5021.649,"So it would be things like the ex expansion of the open hours, increase of the daily beds, increased services, Ppe.",90,,
514,0.97,5021.649,5029.991,"That it is what I was imagining in the mitigation strategy but when its Ramped down, is this seven million?",91,,
515,0.97,5029.991,5042.07,"The ramp down is funding for one year and after one year, the Federal money will be gone.",92,,
516,0.97,5042.07,5049.844,"So if there we continue into 2023, there will be an alternative funding source.",92,,
517,0.97,5049.844,5050.779,So essentially it's two years of funding.,92,,
518,0.97,5050.779,5055.784,All right.,93,,
519,0.97,5055.784,5056.117,Thank you.,93,,
520,0.97,5056.117,5061.456,Any other questions?,93,,
521,0.97,5061.456,5061.656,Okay.,93,,
522,0.97,5061.656,5068.396,I think that's the high-level overview.,93,,
523,0.97,5068.396,5068.797,I thank you all.,93,,
524,0.97,5068.797,5074.402,It's good to see some faces we don't often see.,93,,
525,0.97,5074.402,5089.317,"Our thanks to the emergency management team and office of emergency management, of housing, and trustee and let's go into the last presentation.",93,,
526,0.97,5089.317,5090.085,Thank you so much.,93,,
527,0.97,5090.085,5092.387,Madam chair?,93,,
528,0.97,5092.387,5098.56,"Or Madam clerk, please read item number five into the record.",93,,
529,0.97,5098.56,5104.799,"Agenda item five, human services Department for brief and discussion.",94,,
530,0.97,5104.799,5110.238,Thank you again for your willingness to join us at 3:30 on a Friday.,95,,
531,0.97,5110.238,5111.739,We have another hour.,95,,
532,0.97,5111.739,5130.258,"I am sure it won't take that long but we want to make sure we have ample time for the material that you received for our Thursday presentation, item number three on from yesterday's agenda and carrying it to today.",95,,
533,0.97,5130.258,5142.437,"This is Hsd, human services Department items that do not relate to homelessness, and thank you again for your staff for all that you have done and for the most vulnerable.",95,,
534,0.97,5142.437,5146.341,And Councilmember Herbold will go first.,95,,
535,0.97,5146.341,5147.408,Great.,96,,
536,0.97,5147.408,5148.676,Thank you.,96,,
537,0.97,5148.676,5163.758,"We don't need to record our names for the record we will go into the next slide and again, Tanya Kim, acting director of the human services Department, newly minted.",96,,
538,0.97,5163.758,5169.731,And I have been in the role for about a month and with the Department about 11 years.,96,,
539,0.97,5169.731,5173.067,We are here to present the human services Department.,96,,
540,0.97,5173.067,5186.147,But you have already heard of us three times on homelessness Úcitywide and safety city wide and now the Coronavirus response and here is an overview of our Department and focusing on the other areas that we do.,96,,
541,0.97,5186.147,5188.216,Thank you so much.,96,,
542,0.97,5188.216,5210.638,"And so for the Hsd 2022 proposed budget, next year we'll continue to partner with communities and community partners around safety investments, strengthen the foundations of our departments to better serve our community and grow in the key investment areas and strengthen our data.",96,,
543,0.97,5210.638,5226.154,"In today's presentation, we'll look ahead at 2022 and discuss our racial equity impact and our capacity as a department.",96,,
544,0.97,5226.154,5242.437,"We'll also review significant changes by the budget at the budget summary level, and like Hsd has had numerous presentations, it will be high level, and we don't have the experts so we are happy to follow up Offline.",96,,
545,0.97,5242.437,5246.074,"Next slide, please.",96,,
546,0.97,5246.074,5260.888,"In 2022, looking ahead, we, of course, are launching our relationship formerly with the King County regional homelessness authority and change management and community safety and violence reduction assessment.",96,,
547,0.97,5260.888,5289.15,"I know that is very important to Councilmember Herbold and others, and other investments in our black and indigenous and people of color communities, for example, our equitable community task force, and the relief from the Seattle rescue plan and strengthening our overall community engagement and racial equity for investment strategies.",96,,
548,0.97,5289.15,5289.45,Next slide.,96,,
549,0.97,5289.45,5308.469,"Racial equity is and has been at the forefront of the way that Hsd has been doing our business, and it's been pronounced in recent years for a demand, really, for how we are doing our business and need to improve.",96,,
550,0.97,5308.469,5330.558,"Our budget Prioritizes resources where disparities exist, and where to focus our funding, and Hsd is developing the proposed budget with the change team leadership, our official justice team and community input.",96,,
551,0.97,5330.558,5332.627,We have received this input throughout the year.,96,,
552,0.97,5332.627,5369.097,"It's not just tied to a proposal but engaging the community more and more, and a couple of examples how Hsd has partnered for the investments and you will see the changes in the upcoming slide but one is the Mayor's office on sexual violence and assault, and gender violence, and we completed sessions with providers and key Stakeholders to understand the opportunity for investments and partnerships.",96,,
553,0.97,5369.097,5389.317,"These investments are informing the way we are spending our funds, for example, and another example of how we are engaging the community is our colleges in the aging and disabilities services.",96,,
554,0.97,5389.317,5401.529,They have a visiting nurse program to support the African- American and Elders program and essential to providing better care for our aging communities because of the health disparities.,96,,
555,0.97,5401.529,5414.308,We are proud of the other investment areas though they might not share the same amount of air time.,96,,
556,0.97,5414.308,5414.609,Next.,96,,
557,0.97,5414.609,5434.495,"There are significant changes and one which is I believe that we all agree is important, a 2.4 percent inflation adjustment for all contractors which is a 6.4 adjustment for the Department.",96,,
558,0.97,5434.495,5450.077,"And with the launch of our partnership with the King County regional homelessness authority, the billion therefore then reflects the 20 remaining positions that were part of the position.",96,,
559,0.97,5450.077,5458.553,And in efforts of consolidating this year we were working to refine our own capacity and our Finance and leadership division.,96,,
560,0.97,5458.553,5476.838,"This might not be very exciting, but making sure that our own capacity and our infrastructure being strong is important to the work that we're doing in partnership with the community, and Hsd will community to strengthen our policy and procedures around finance.",96,,
561,0.97,5476.838,5490.585,And finally we are returning to a true structure and why that's important is we need the appropriate oversight and capacity.,96,,
562,0.97,5490.585,5497.391,One deputy will oversee the aging and disability services which for context is about half Department.,96,,
563,0.97,5497.391,5517.178,"They have about 200 people as well as overseeing our homeless response which remains in the Department, and the second deputy will oversee the youth and family empowerment position as well as our new face of the driving community division.",96,,
564,0.97,5517.178,5518.045,Next slide.,96,,
565,0.97,5518.045,5526.42,"I did talk about our capacity in the previous slide, and I'll continue to talk more about some measure.",96,,
566,0.97,5526.42,5534.395,"We have a Stipend for staff using languages in their work, and that's from the city light initiative.",96,,
567,0.97,5534.395,5536.264,There are new additions.,96,,
568,0.97,5536.264,5548.509,We are getting more staff to enhance the position because it's a greater need.,96,,
569,0.97,5548.509,5554.615,These are supporting on survivors of domestic violence and sexual assaults.,96,,
570,0.97,5554.615,5574.535,"We are looking at establishing funding for the Finance capacity because the budget has grown significantly and more complex than in the past several years, and next, our Cfo will cover the details of the proposed budget changes.",96,,
571,0.97,5574.535,5584.712,"Thank you, acting director Kim and good afternoon, Madam chair and Councilmembers.",97,,
572,0.97,5584.712,5613.541,"The 2022 proposed budget from a numbers standpoint represents an impact of $22 million, and one area is in the shelter program slated to close in March 2022 and our food program which still remains greater than the Pre-Covid funding level in 2019.",97,,
573,0.97,5613.541,5626.654,I have noted there are specific questions and concerned by Council that we noted earlier and work with the staff to get the answers that were previously asked.,97,,
574,0.97,5626.654,5632.393,The following slide will highlight significant changes by Hsd at the budget summary level.,97,,
575,0.97,5632.393,5638.499,Let's start off with the areas supporting healthy aging.,97,,
576,0.97,5638.499,5662.39,"The fiscal year '22 budget initially proposed $150,000 for funding a visiting nurse program identified by the African-American Elders program as an immediate addition to improve the health and quality of life they serve, and this will provide funding to hire a registered nurse to provide nursing care to approximately 200 African-American Elders in the city.",97,,
577,0.97,5662.39,5673.801,We will be Leveraging a funding opportunity with the Seattle housing authority to increase the number of case managers serving clients within the Seattle housing authority.,97,,
578,0.97,5673.801,5686.814,"This funding will provide exactly 30 additional case management hours to high-risk residents of the Seattle housing community with a focus on behavioral health, medical, and long-term care services.",97,,
579,0.97,5686.814,5710.404,And there will be an additional $4 million from the state from which is already comprised of title 19 as a result of additional clients served in King County and additional funding we'll be receiving to enhance the quality of care to our clients.,97,,
580,0.97,5710.404,5712.506,"Next slide, please.",97,,
581,0.97,5712.506,5746.44,"For promoting public health, the two significant increases will be a $1.5 million increase in direct Healthcare providers that offer culturally responsive care to community member and to complement the service, $1 million in improved access to the Culturall responsive care, so it's get out to the community and provide the response to the community need.",97,,
582,0.97,5746.44,5746.74,Next slide.,97,,
583,0.97,5746.74,5754.815,The next indicates the changes with Affordability and Liveability.,97,,
584,0.97,5754.815,5790.417,"$200,000 to continue funding for local farmers to provide school to preschool and After- school programs and focus on serving the community with a $2.5 million allocation to support food programs as they ramp down the Covid response programming levels which as I mentioned before still remain higher than the 2019 Pre- pandemic level but lower than the current levels that being funded.",97,,
585,0.97,5790.417,5792.453,Next slide.,97,,
586,0.97,5792.453,5805.332,There's an extensive discuss about the significant changes to safe communities by our director.,97,,
587,0.97,5805.332,5826.82,Just to highlight some of the things where we will continue to fund the community services funded through the community safety capacity in fiscal year '21 and funding and providing for positions to support Gender- based violence programs and funding to address Anti-Asian hate crimes.,97,,
588,0.97,5826.82,5829.757,And the last slide.,97,,
589,0.97,5829.757,5847.808,"Judgmentally just want to give you a preview of the current funding levels that we are anticipating to carry forward into fiscal year '21--'22, excuse me, which will be the basis in the way that we continue the current level of services.",97,,
590,0.97,5847.808,5848.442,I won't read through the slide.,97,,
591,0.97,5848.442,5862.69,"Most of the areas have been discussed previously in greater detail, and with that, I will return the Mic over to director--acting director Kim.",97,,
592,0.97,5862.69,5868.863,What questions do you have for us?,98,,
593,0.97,5868.863,5869.997,"Well, that was a record presentation.",99,,
594,0.97,5869.997,5870.464,Thank you very much.,99,,
595,0.97,5870.464,5882.176,"I know you had an extra day with the information and we have as well, and there are questions.",99,,
596,0.97,5882.176,5888.415,I do see Councilmember Herbold the chair will go first and then Councilmember Morales.,99,,
597,0.97,5888.415,5889.884,Thank you so much.,100,,
598,0.97,5889.884,5894.021,I just want to start off with remarks of appreciation.,100,,
599,0.97,5894.021,5898.259,It's true there is a lot to dig in here.,100,,
600,0.97,5898.259,5908.802,But I really do appreciate that this presentation focuses on Hsd's work that doesn't always grab the headlines.,100,,
601,0.97,5908.802,5914.174,A big structural change coming to Hsd in the year ahead.,100,,
602,0.97,5914.174,5920.614,This was not the first year that Hsd has been managing.,100,,
603,0.97,5920.614,5930.524,"Not only has the Department start off a new division, responds to need for communities and approaches to build community safety from the ground up.",100,,
604,0.97,5930.524,5938.432,They did this while managing a whole lot of changes in their leadership structure.,100,,
605,0.97,5938.432,5970.331,"Looking forward, Hsd has this transition of the homelessness strategy, the regional homelessness authority and the long plan expected but it's a significant change, and I mentioned here just to recognize that it created a lot of, I think--I'm trying to use a word that's a positive word because I know Hsd folks are doing so much work and doing it well.",100,,
606,0.97,5970.331,5972.8,But I know it's been difficult.,100,,
607,0.97,5972.8,5974.335,I just really want to recognize that.,100,,
608,0.97,5974.335,5986.413,And I want to recognize the fact that Hsd employees also left their desks to go into the field to distribute food.,100,,
609,0.97,5986.413,5996.69,"Staff worked on the ground to man shelters, and there is all the work, obviously, to help people struggle and survive through the pandemic.",100,,
610,0.97,5996.69,5998.292,And that work has not let up at all.,100,,
611,0.97,5998.292,6016.543,"I want to give my heart felt thanks to you, the leadership of Hsd and every Hsd employee who has Persevered in the past year and a half and is somehow ready to take on the challenges of the future.",100,,
612,0.97,6016.543,6022.249,"So that's really, again--I want to lift that up.",100,,
613,0.97,6022.249,6034.828,And I also want to just mention that I focus a lot on the community safety investments that are helping through the safe and thriving communities division.,100,,
614,0.97,6034.828,6054.381,"I am hoping in the budget process we can think more broadly about what's been called the shadow pandemic, the secondary impact of fear and isolation expressed by so 19 many in our city in the last year and a half.",100,,
615,0.97,6054.381,6110.07,"I think we are starting to see the impact between health and safety with increased domestic violence, gun violence, mental health crises, and low-level crime, and moving past the initial crises we have been struggling when we need to think how to Build-Back better with the human infrastructure, and in the budget I will be looking to help address the secondary impacts by investing in the mental health to secure our mental health and safety and hoping that we can talk about Piloting a mental health initiative for Seattle.",100,,
616,0.97,6110.07,6121.615,I know a lot of cities are grappling with these changes and I want to see how other jurisdictions are doing with that.,100,,
617,0.97,6121.615,6126.42,"Madam chair, may I ask a couple of questions?",100,,
618,0.97,6126.42,6127.554,"Yes, you may.",101,,
619,0.97,6127.554,6127.855,That much.,101,,
620,0.97,6127.855,6133.093,And Councilmember Morales as well.,101,,
621,0.97,6133.093,6138.398,"Thank you, and the slide includes the agency and placement factor of 2.4.",102,,
622,0.97,6138.398,6154.481,I want to be clear that this item increases the contracted agencies to account for increases in their real costs due to inflation or to improve employee wages.,102,,
623,0.97,6154.481,6162.322,This cost increase was passed by Council in 2019 under Madam chair Mosqueda's leadership.,102,,
624,0.97,6162.322,6186.146,"We know there is more needed to meet the real costs of effective robust services that we need, and I want to also appreciate Councilmember Lewis's Roundtable of homelessness providers to lead to higher wages and better benefits so Non-Profits can effectively do all that we need them to do.",102,,
625,0.97,6186.146,6208.502,"I'm really interested in--my interest is in a proposal for the human coalition for this particular sector, and I am wondering if it's something already funded in the budget or I should be looking with my colleagues to find funding for.",102,,
626,0.97,6208.502,6213.64,Hopefully we have funding for such a study in the budget.,103,,
627,0.97,6213.64,6214.141,But I can confirm.,103,,
628,0.97,6214.141,6218.045,I can confirm.,104,,
629,0.97,6218.045,6218.212,No.,104,,
630,0.97,6218.212,6226.553,"Currently, the budget submission does not include or extend funding for that consideration at this time.",104,,
631,0.97,6226.553,6227.955,Thank you very much.,105,,
632,0.97,6227.955,6238.899,"And Councilmember Herbold, to your first question, this is intended to be for reorganization of the city.",106,,
633,0.97,6238.899,6240.667,The 2.4 percent.,107,,
634,0.97,6240.667,6240.934,Yeah.,108,,
635,0.97,6240.934,6252.679,And the other is a budget request for the wage increase.,109,,
636,0.97,6252.679,6279.973,"Down to the--I am skipping over to the page that identifies the under spend and it looks like 52.5 million, and much seems to be planned to carry forward in 2022 as it was appropriated in 2021 but there appears to be 5.6 million in under spend that was not proposed to be carried forward.",109,,
637,0.97,6279.973,6289.216,I wonder if there is a plan for the under spend in the proposed budget.,109,,
638,0.97,6289.216,6290.083,I'm sorry.,110,,
639,0.97,6290.083,6296.156,I am trying to pull up my last slide.,110,,
640,0.97,6296.156,6296.423,Sorry.,111,,
641,0.97,6296.423,6297.09,I'm skipping around.,111,,
642,0.97,6297.09,6322.349,"The purpose of this slide was to show the funding that we received this year, the current authority that we plan on carrying forward through a request to Council into fiscal year '22.",112,,
643,0.97,6322.349,6330.557,5 million--I'm not--I'm not seeing--I don't quite understand the background with the $5 million Delta.,112,,
644,0.97,6330.557,6338.465,I believe that you observed there was $5 million missing.,112,,
645,0.97,6338.465,6344.237,So let's see.,113,,
646,0.97,6344.237,6354.081,"The Hsd budget, the under spend and the funds here do not account for the 2.5 million.",113,,
647,0.97,6354.081,6362.322,I think there is 5.6 million that is not proposed as a carry forward listed on this page.,113,,
648,0.97,6362.322,6364.558,Let's get back with the details on that.,114,,
649,0.97,6364.558,6368.795,I want to make sure I get it right rather than speculate.,114,,
650,0.97,6368.795,6369.129,All right.,115,,
651,0.97,6369.129,6370.864,Thank you.,115,,
652,0.97,6370.864,6386.346,"And on the Gender-Based violence services there is $875,000 for Gender-Based violence services with a note effective with the '22 funding gap.",115,,
653,0.97,6386.346,6399.993,Is the funding gap for a loss of funding?,115,,
654,0.97,6399.993,6400.227,No.,116,,
655,0.97,6400.227,6412.639,That addresses the loss of funding with the funding that was previously through the--I believe defense the industry's victims' fund.,116,,
656,0.97,6412.639,6416.309,I used an Acronym.,117,,
657,0.97,6416.309,6418.044,"Oh, I'm sorry.",118,,
658,0.97,6418.044,6420.28,But that funding stream was reduced.,118,,
659,0.97,6420.28,6424.684,"However, the importance of the program and the need for the program continues.",118,,
660,0.97,6424.684,6430.557,"This is a general funding, a significant one, obviously.",119,,
661,0.97,6430.557,6446.239,"And the previous approach to funding is to find--wasn't Geerating the revenue needed to sustain the program and obviously or maybe not Obviously, the program is truly of value.",119,,
662,0.97,6446.239,6454.347,"Thanks, and then I think we have the answer but I want to confirm it.",120,,
663,0.97,6454.347,6482.309,"The services that the Council provided funding for last year, the funds were high priority, and I want to ensure that those dollars are protected for 2022 and ask if there is any Council action to carry them forward?",120,,
664,0.97,6482.309,6489.816,I believe we have Incumbered them this year.,120,,
665,0.97,6489.816,6496.69,"Councilmember, I will follow up on the specific status of the contract and what is obligated to date.",121,,
666,0.97,6496.69,6499.326,Okay.,122,,
667,0.97,6499.326,6499.826,Thank you.,122,,
668,0.97,6499.826,6502.095,Thank you.,123,,
669,0.97,6502.095,6506.233,"Thank you for the questions, Councilmember Herbold.",123,,
670,0.97,6506.233,6506.733,Councilmember Morales?,123,,
671,0.97,6506.733,6509.603,Thank you and thank you again for being here everyone.,124,,
672,0.97,6509.603,6509.836,Sorry.,124,,
673,0.97,6509.836,6511.838,Let me get to my notes here.,124,,
674,0.97,6511.838,6512.138,All right.,124,,
675,0.97,6512.138,6512.572,Okay.,124,,
676,0.97,6512.572,6518.044,I've got just a few questions.,124,,
677,0.97,6518.044,6524.651,The first is about the leadership and administration.,124,,
678,0.97,6524.651,6542.302,"Given there is a substantial Hsd portfolio moving to the homeless, can you explain the increase that was added?",124,,
679,0.97,6542.302,6549.276,Can you explain what those roles are?,124,,
680,0.97,6549.576,6550.41,.,124,,
681,0.97,6551.711,6558.418,"Do you want to take that Offline, or are you prepared to address that?",125,,
682,0.97,6558.418,6566.293,I'll get the specific titles and positions.,126,,
683,0.97,6566.293,6582.375,"Generally, the indirect budget has increased, and as far as using the grant revenue, 75 or 25 percent, excuse me, of the costs are typically supported by grant revenue, the indirect portion of grant revenue.",126,,
684,0.97,6582.375,6583.677,Okay.,127,,
685,0.97,6583.677,6583.944,"So, Yeah.",127,,
686,0.97,6583.944,6590.083,"If you could clarify what the roles are and the grants associated with them, it would be helpful.",127,,
687,0.97,6590.083,6590.283,Okay.,127,,
688,0.97,6590.283,6594.387,There is a million and a half for Re-Entry program funding.,127,,
689,0.97,6594.387,6602.729,Is that going to be in the process of currently contracted programs?,127,,
690,0.97,6602.729,6608.234,It's an Rfd process.,128,,
691,0.97,6608.234,6626.753,It's an expedited Rfp process this month and Incumbered this year and go through next year and that's through the equitable communities initiative.,128,,
692,0.97,6626.753,6634.194,"Regarding the equitable communities initiative, health characters inclusive access to Healthcare and inclusive direct Healthcare.",129,,
693,0.97,6634.194,6637.197,"We don't typically do direct, I don't think.",129,,
694,0.97,6637.197,6658.652,Can you talk a little bit about the types of programs you are envisioning here and I'm especially interested in which direction the city will move as it relates to public health and there is an opportunity to have leverage fund for mental health support.,129,,
695,0.97,6658.652,6682.242,"Again, Yeah, Eci equitable communities initiative, I think part of Councilmember Herbold's opening remarks touched on that, the need for culturally responsive different care and including by behavioral health, and that's what we will vest vest in.",130,,
696,0.97,6682.242,6710.437,"And we don't do that directly, so we will be moving the dollars, and another initiative I can't have off the top of my head, and we will issue working with providers to stay on the focus outreach and make sure our community members have access and strengthening and Culturallally responsive and it's broad reaching, including behavioral health.",130,,
697,0.97,6710.437,6720.647,So I am really interested in the idea of culturally appropriate mental health services.,131,,
698,0.97,6720.647,6749.776,"Given the District I represent we have a lot of folks especially right now who are struggling with all kinds of things, and so I'm really interested in understanding better how as a city we might be able to provide some support even if we're not doing it directly, supporting public health and other entities and very specifically in culturally appropriate mental health services because that's a whole other follow up.",131,,
699,0.97,6749.776,6753.179,I look forward to following up with you on that.,131,,
700,0.97,6753.179,6758.518,"And the other organization, I apologize, is healthier here.",132,,
701,0.97,6758.518,6762.555,We will work with the public health and healthier here.,132,,
702,0.97,6762.555,6762.822,Okay.,133,,
703,0.97,6762.822,6765.492,Thank you very much.,133,,
704,0.97,6765.492,6767.894,Any additional questions?,134,,
705,0.97,6767.894,6769.429,"Oh, please go ahead Council President.",134,,
706,0.97,6769.429,6770.096,Not a question.,135,,
707,0.97,6770.096,6790.316,Just a--I want to support the last comment from Councilmember Morales and in addition to there being a focus in being sure that there is cultural relevance to the programming.,135,,
708,0.97,6790.316,6793.386,I want to encourage to include language.,135,,
709,0.97,6793.386,6798.358,We obviously have a lot of great health clinics in the area who would be good partners in that.,135,,
710,0.97,6798.358,6810.27,I am sure you already knew about it but I say it out loud just to make sure that we get it on the record.,135,,
711,0.97,6810.27,6810.603,Well said.,136,,
712,0.97,6810.603,6812.472,Appreciate that.,136,,
713,0.97,6812.472,6818.478,So I have a question that does deal with homeless services.,136,,
714,0.97,6818.478,6822.549,So I promise it's not about implementation or programs.,136,,
715,0.97,6822.549,6867.827,"It's about process, and director Kim, I was wondering if you can help me to understand more how we will be transparent with the public and how we can create some sense of the Council in an executive role in identifying how this $104.2 million that is going from Hsd's homelessness services investments and into the King County regional homelessness authority, what is the plan for how the city still has a chance to review some of those strategies and what role is Hsd being asked to play with evaluating how that transition occurs?",136,,
716,0.97,6867.827,6902.362,"I apologize for my colleagues who may be more in the weave on those especially those on the board, but if we are receiving a budget for 91 percent of the funds from homeless services investments are going into King County regional authority, and that is over $9 million, what role do we have in the transition to see how the dollars are being invested and better explain to the public what programs are being carried forward or what is going to be new.",136,,
717,0.97,6902.362,6910.003,"Well, my--my--okay.",137,,
718,0.97,6910.003,6926.452,"So one month, and my Department has been focusing on other areas but my understanding is really, the idea is--well, first, we're working very closely with King County and the regional homelessness authority on the agreement and making sure that we're aligned.",137,,
719,0.97,6926.452,6962.422,"The other is that in 2022 we are not expecting too many changes, and this is about creating stability for providers and allowing the authorities to have the capacity that they need in order to operate any future R FDS, and the regional authority will have ownership over the body of work, and my understanding is that it's a great opportunity to give input and influence as well.",137,,
720,0.97,6962.422,6980.94,But I will need to follow up on additional ways in which the city can help influence that and maybe Ben or others here who do serve on the boards might be more Insightful.,137,,
721,0.97,6980.94,6986.312,But we are setting the stage right now and making sure there is a process for the city input.,137,,
722,0.97,6986.312,7027.186,"But there shouldn't be significant changes right away, and we're communicating with our providers, and I have heard mark say that those contracts that we do have for the most part were maintaining with the exception of all of the a contract if you will to govern the way that the city's money flows.",137,,
723,0.97,7027.186,7036.062,That the Governance side will be determined through the policy level direction.,137,,
724,0.97,7036.062,7037.029,Our dollars going to them.,137,,
725,0.97,7037.029,7067.593,"We will need among other things one of the things that needs to be dealt with, some of the money that will be . that is another place where a opportunity to set out the terms which the city and the agency are interacting.",137,,
726,0.97,7067.593,7070.496,Particularly around the financial side and the contracting side.,137,,
727,0.97,7070.496,7075.768,Do I have the dollar amount correct?,138,,
728,0.97,7075.768,7078.604,$104.2Million going over to the regional homelessness authority?,138,,
729,0.97,7078.604,7083.676,"I would call the number, but I don't have it in front of me.",139,,
730,0.97,7083.676,7085.978,Maybe that was a better question for you.,140,,
731,0.97,7085.978,7087.447,It is very significant.,141,,
732,0.97,7087.447,7093.92,Whatever the sum.,141,,
733,0.97,7093.92,7095.455,It is usually significant.,141,,
734,0.97,7095.455,7104.03,"I think that is, I want to again underscore what I think every Councilmember has said when we talked about homeless services as it relates to the questions about transition.",142,,
735,0.97,7104.03,7123.249,We are all committed to this regional homelessness authority and a more coordinated response so we can weave together not just the shelter and housing type options for emergency housing options.,142,,
736,0.97,7123.249,7125.952,But also the health services largely led by King County.,142,,
737,0.97,7125.952,7134.76,There is a scale and coordination that benefit those living in shelters and helping them to get connected to housing.,142,,
738,0.97,7134.76,7139.198,We will stay laser focused on the housing and in our budgets in the past.,142,,
739,0.97,7139.198,7167.793,"I guess, what I'm trying to ask is, continuing to show members of the public frustrated by what they perceive as a growing crisis that needs immediate action and a lot of us going into the sixth year of a declared state of emergency we are the ones they will call.",142,,
740,0.97,7167.793,7175.902,I doubt there are many constituents calling the regional homelessness authority or Emailing the Ceo of the Rha.,142,,
741,0.97,7175.902,7178.437,They are Emailing us.,142,,
742,0.97,7178.437,7179.472,We are their elected officials.,142,,
743,0.97,7179.472,7183.075,So I do want to have a better sense as we identify policy.,142,,
744,0.97,7183.075,7200.259,I want to have a better sense of how we understand the flow of money and the flow of those contracts and how we are able to then report out to constituents what's happening.,142,,
745,0.97,7200.259,7215.241,"What you are describing are ultimately, the underlying Governance question about the regional entity and its relative authority over the way resources are directed versus the city's.",143,,
746,0.97,7215.241,7222.682,"What is happening in large part, we are taking contracts let and turning them over to the agency first year.",143,,
747,0.97,7222.682,7228.087,"Beyond that, the agency will have a more direct role.",143,,
748,0.97,7228.087,7236.529,"And, those who serve on the board and can provide some of that information.",143,,
749,0.97,7236.529,7249.108,"I think this question is one that will evolve the next year and beyond as the agency stands up and if you will, what had been the theoretical governing structures become real and start making real policy decisions and direction.",143,,
750,0.97,7249.108,7254.013,So I don't mean to Dodge a question.,143,,
751,0.97,7254.013,7260.486,"But, this is a pivoting moment where the city's role will be different than it has in the past.",143,,
752,0.97,7260.486,7268.094,It is in part to be determined.,143,,
753,0.97,7268.094,7272.265,And Lastly because I think this is an Hsd question still.,144,,
754,0.97,7272.265,7276.269,This is part of the conversation that you are not prepared to have today.,144,,
755,0.97,7276.269,7300.292,Can you tell me how the Department has been involved in helping to notify existing staff of opportunity to apply for jobs at the new authority and what that process internally has looked like so we can maintain some continuity for the individual personnel helping provide key contract Withs our community partners.,144,,
756,0.97,7300.292,7305.131,"We have been working on our, keeping our employees whole quite some time.",145,,
757,0.97,7305.131,7307.533,And the time lines have been delayed.,145,,
758,0.97,7307.533,7313.172,"And so, we have been in close communication with Rha.",145,,
759,0.97,7313.172,7318.144,I know they have been hiring through competitive processes.,145,,
760,0.97,7318.144,7323.382,Several of our staff are working there now.,145,,
761,0.97,7323.382,7330.656,"And, so, we are very much looking forward to that ongoing relationship.",145,,
762,0.97,7330.656,7342.201,"The other in terms of keeping our team whole, we have identified positions for our folks to move into after our positions are Aggravaed.",145,,
763,0.97,7342.201,7346.639,"For our permanent staff, we have secured positions elsewhere in the Department.",145,,
764,0.97,7346.639,7356.282,"And, because this has been going on for some time, there are of course other staff who colleagues have already Transitioned.",145,,
765,0.97,7356.282,7356.549,Okay.,146,,
766,0.97,7356.549,7362.354,"Well, we will look forward to learning more.",146,,
767,0.97,7362.354,7366.092,Just Pauseing to see if there are any additional comments or questions.,146,,
768,0.97,7366.092,7373.966,Just really quickly on your point related to that Rha and the ongoing Connectivity.,147,,
769,0.97,7373.966,7395.387,"And I think fundamentally, what your questions are about, how do we, effectively one of two funding agencies of Rha maintain our responsibility and duty to taxpayers to understand that body of work and what our taxpayers are paying for.",147,,
770,0.97,7395.387,7398.891,There is potentially an opportunity to take another look at the Ila.,147,,
771,0.97,7398.891,7404.663,The Interlocal agreement to see what it says about that.,147,,
772,0.97,7404.663,7414.407,And the reality is that we as a city Council and a city will continue to have representatives at the homelessness authority.,147,,
773,0.97,7414.407,7416.575,The governing committee.,147,,
774,0.97,7416.575,7431.791,And that will be an opportunity for there to be a back and forth flow of ongoing information between the city of Seattle and the Rha as a new structure.,147,,
775,0.97,7431.791,7432.625,But it is new.,147,,
776,0.97,7432.625,7440.366,"And, we are all learning and adapting as it continues to get stood up.",147,,
777,0.97,7440.366,7454.747,"So, there will be an opportunity for us to sort of modify our practices and roll with it as it continues to become more solidified and Operationallized.",147,,
778,0.97,7454.747,7464.857,"The other thing I wanted to say, as the city, our biggest accountability metric is through the budget.",147,,
779,0.97,7464.857,7470.429,We retain our complete budget appropriation authority.,147,,
780,0.97,7470.429,7493.118,"And, you know, if we do not believe that the results are being produced by the Rha that we expect or that our constituents respect, we have an opportunity to reflect that perspective via our upcoming budget appropriation positions.",147,,
781,0.97,7493.118,7508.934,"I'll add that of course with the agreement, there will be reporting requirements and we will continue to track the outcomes and be prepare today provide data and information to Council too.",148,,
782,0.97,7508.934,7510.636,"Great, well thank you very much.",149,,
783,0.97,7510.636,7513.072,And thank you Council president for that summary.,149,,
784,0.97,7513.072,7513.339,As well.,149,,
785,0.97,7513.339,7518.21,This is something that I think we get Emailed about hundreds of times a day.,149,,
786,0.97,7518.21,7530.322,It is something I have reached out to business owners and folks who are working with those who are experiencing homelessness and it is one of the most pressing crises in our country right now.,149,,
787,0.97,7530.322,7537.663,It is absolutely being manifested in the streets of Seattle and we have a population that has grown by 20% before Covid.,149,,
788,0.97,7537.663,7542.067,We didn't have enough housing before that.,149,,
789,0.97,7542.067,7545.905,The questions we have to address in the budget and beyond.,149,,
790,0.97,7545.905,7549.775,"In terms of how we create a housed, healthy, and safe Seattle.",149,,
791,0.97,7549.775,7558.617,That is I think the end of my questions and I don't see any additional comments.,149,,
792,0.97,7558.617,7558.984,Or questions.,149,,
793,0.97,7558.984,7566.659,"Diector Kim and Joseph, thank you very much for your patience and being willing to come back and join us today.",149,,
