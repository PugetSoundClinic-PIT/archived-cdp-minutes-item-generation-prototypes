82,0.97,593.059,601.033,There was language added towards the end of the legislative session that restricts this a little bit.,32,,
83,0.97,601.033,617.283,"It can only be applied for customers who have already been using an existing assistance program, whether that is a local rate pay or sponsor utility program, such as the city utility discount program.",32,,
84,0.97,617.283,624.824,That does limit a little bit the number of our customers who can participate.,32,,

97,0.97,795.027,801.6,I will pause there for any questions and then I will hand it over to Elsa to talk about capital.,32,,
98,0.97,801.6,804.203,Are there any questions anyone has for Quinn before we move on?,33,,

101,0.97,808.04,809.842,"Thanks, Quinn.",35,,
102,0.97,809.842,829.962,This was a historic here in 2021 . really large investments this year in the capital budget particularly in the areas of affordable housing and shelter.,35,,
103,0.97,829.962,833.265,We sought 300 million this year for the rapid acquisition of affordable housing and shelter spaces.,35,,
104,0.97,833.265,843.776,This is something the city has for in the past including 210 in grants to purchase housing and shelter space of a variety of types that the city might see on the market's purchase.,35,,

107,0.97,883.182,894.426,"$10 million earmarked for a facility in King County, but the rest of that available for grants are not limited geographically.",35,,
108,0.97,894.426,904.27,This region could benefit from some of those additional investments in behavioral health . Another area of focus was on the Weatherization plus health program.,35,,
109,0.97,904.27,926.025,This program helps low income houses update to better energy efficiency and health efficiency . I think there is a recognition at this late legislator that sometimes those who have both Weatherization problems have air quality or asthma issues.,35,,
110,0.97,926.025,933.365,This program addresses those two features of people's houses in tandem.,35,,
111,0.97,933.365,951.317,"There was also funding for homeless youth facilities and funding to help public utilities connect affordable housing projects with utilities, so that is something our utilities have been able to make use of in the past and apply those grants to get new, affordable housing projects connected.",35,,

118,0.97,983.649,994.893,The package will raise approximately just shy of $17 billion over the next 16 years.,37,,
119,0.97,994.893,1022.121,"The revenue sources and funding allocations haven't changed significantly since the briefing that we did earlier on in the legislative session, except for the expert fuel tax proposal was dropped late in legislative session and sort of replaced by two transfers from the general Fund and the public works trust fund.",37,,
120,0.97,1022.121,1038.17,"The overview document provides a broader summary of the revenues and spending, so I will not go into too much detail there.",37,,
121,0.97,1038.17,1049.314,I invest pretty significantly in a Multimodal transportation and Decarbonization primarily through the latter two several grant programs that as.,37,,
122,0.97,1049.314,1051.984,Has been competitive in and we imagine they would continue to do so.,37,,
123,0.97,1051.984,1059.958,I will focus specifically on the Seattle projects including receiving funding in the transportation revenue package.,37,,
124,0.97,1059.958,1069.034,I do want to note the Legislature did something a little different this year.,37,,
125,0.97,1069.034,1080.579,"Historically when you have done these transportation revenue packages, there has been a detailed schedule of the projects and when each project will receive funding over the 16 years.",37,,
126,0.97,1080.579,1083.215,They didn't do that this time.,37,,
127,0.97,1083.215,1091.59,"They allocated some funding, so basically this year and next year.",37,,
128,0.97,1091.59,1096.295,The remainder of the projects will be determined in the future.,37,,
129,0.97,1096.295,1107.039,This is something that we will be working on in the legislative sessions to make sure that we are securing those funds in the most timely manner that they can be used.,37,,
130,0.97,1107.039,1119.818,"I want to know that for these projects that I am about to speak to, we don't know when exactly the funding will be coming to the city, just that it will be.",37,,
131,0.97,1119.818,1129.061,There is $406 million that will be invested to Backfill project shortfalls related to delay costs and other cost increases on the state route 520 project.,37,,
132,0.97,1129.061,1139.137,"There is $50 million for improvements to the North Aurora corridor, specifically around safety improvements.",37,,
133,0.97,1139.137,1163.061,"There is $25 million for the regional transportation corridor . You know, predominantly focused on the Ballard and magnolia bridges, but also several spot improvements in that corridor.",37,,
134,0.97,1163.061,1179.111,"In addition to the transportation and revenue package, the Legislature approved this year the 2022 spending supplemental transportation budget and there are items pertinent to the city.",37,,
135,0.97,1179.111,1194.56,The first 2022 budget included $9 million for Wsdot to Re- improve the city for costs related to the Covid-19 pandemic on the service Street reconstruction.,37,,
136,0.97,1194.56,1221.386,"There is also $5 million in additional funding for Wsdot cleanup and rights-of-way up to $8 million . and finally, I know Councilmember Herbold as well as others, there is a $600,000 to conduct a community led Visioning process for decommissioning SR 99 in the South Park neighborhood.",37,,
137,0.97,1221.386,1229.261,Can I ask you a quick question?,38,,

139,0.97,1230.762,1235.934,"I was looking at the move ahead Washington transportation package . I know we talked about this before, but help me understand.",38,,
140,0.97,1235.934,1238.604,It is $5 million for the cleanup for Wsdot statewide?,38,,
141,0.97,1238.604,1242.107,Yes.,39,,

143,0.97,1247.179,1247.579,Yes.,41,,
144,0.97,1247.579,1252.651,That is correct.,41,,
145,0.97,1252.651,1255.287,They have created an office that would manage the coordination rights-of-way.,41,,
146,0.97,1255.287,1290.422,"Senate bill 5662 did not pass and so there was no funding for that office . I think what we saw instead was the increased amounts of funding for the cleanup and transportation budget as well as that $45 million for Transitioning individuals from the Rights-Of- way into affordable and permanent sort of housing as well as, you know, significant investments in the capital infrastructure.",41,,
147,0.97,1290.422,1295.794,So we got funded to help people get into housing and we got $5 million statewide to clean up along I-5 or Wsdot?,42,,
148,0.97,1295.794,1298.163,Yes.,43,,

160,0.97,1347.112,1349.948,This will ban the manufacture and distribution of high- capacity magazines.,48,,
161,0.97,1349.948,1361.526,"This was a big priority for gun responsibility advocates and legislators for a long time and was a huge one this year in the area of gun responsibility, but not the only one.",48,,
162,0.97,1361.526,1369.401,We saw built around restricting weapons in civic spaces and closing the ghost gun loophole.,48,,
163,0.97,1369.401,1376.808,The first was a follow-up to a bill passed in 2021 which band open carry on the campus.,48,,
164,0.97,1376.808,1388.553,This extended that prohibition to local governments including school boards and city halls and also election and ballot facilities.,48,,
165,0.97,1388.553,1397.062,"You know, sort of what the legislator did for their own public meetings . They did for local governments and school boards.",48,,
166,0.97,1397.062,1411.109,And 1705 closed the loophole around the manufacture and sale of ghost guns.,48,,
167,0.97,1411.109,1413.345,Basically treating them the same as other firearms within the state.,48,,
168,0.97,1413.345,1415.714,It was a large year for gun responsibility in the Legislature.,48,,
169,0.97,1415.714,1419.851,Those three wins were really important for a lot of folks.,48,,
170,0.97,1419.851,1433.598,"On public safety, something that I think we have briefed you all on several times before during our weekly sessions was around a follow-up to use of force legislation in the Legislature.",48,,
171,0.97,1433.598,1440.605,There were three bills this year that updated that legislation.,48,,
172,0.97,1440.605,1443.208,"1719, 1735, and 2037.",48,,
173,0.97,1443.208,1448.28,"A fourth bill, 5919, did not move forward this year.",48,,
174,0.97,1448.28,1453.351,We have been tracking all four of those and sharing that information with you all.,48,,
175,0.97,1453.351,1467.933,The first was on military equipment . I think the goal of this bill was to provide a clarity that law enforcement would be able to use less lethal methods under this use of force legislation.,48,,
176,0.97,1467.933,1522.854,"The second was regarding behavioral health interventions from representative Johnson and this was a big focus on affordable housing and behavioral health providers this year to clarify that law enforcement would be able to join in helping those providers with folks experiencing behavioral health crises . The final bill I think was the most controversial of the three, or the most significant for many advocates . that defines physical force in law and modified the standard for use of force . Some of you have been following this legislation closely, but in modified the state language around Terry stops or when people are fleeing from stops . As I said, it defines the law.",48,,
177,0.97,1522.854,1527.659,Those three bills were around sort of the police use of force subject area.,48,,
178,0.97,1527.659,1544.376,A fourth bill that I would like to highlight that I believe Councilmember Herbold and others have been following have been on catalytic Converters.,48,,
179,0.97,1544.376,1564.696,1815 updated a number of areas regarding catalytic Converters including regulations for scrap metal processors . There are a number of other steps including the creation of a consumer protect act violation as well as the creation of a work group to study further solutions needed help address the catalytic Converters . that's what I've got for public safety.,48,,
180,0.97,1564.696,1584.783,"The only question I had was the House bill 2307, use of force, and the ones that didn't pass, is this the one that everyone could agree on, on the use of force?",49,,
181,0.97,1584.783,1587.285,I do not think everyone could agree on this one.,50,,
182,0.97,1587.285,1588.653,Okay.,51,,
183,0.97,1588.653,1593.158,There was originally an idea this would be in one piece of legislation and that did not happen.,52,,
184,0.97,1593.158,1615.947,"The other bill, 5919, addressed some of the same subject areas as 2037. it was amended in House committee to focus on the vehicular pursuits, but the house and Senate did not come to an agreement on the bill language, so did not move forward.",52,,
185,0.97,1615.947,1616.481,Thank you.,53,,
186,0.97,1616.481,1620.518,"Are there any questions on some of this stuff, people?",53,,
187,0.97,1620.518,1622.754,I don't see any.,53,,
188,0.97,1622.754,1623.588,"Go ahead, Elsa.",53,,
189,0.97,1623.588,1627.859,Or is it Quinn?,53,,
190,0.97,1627.859,1628.66,Back to me.,54,,
191,0.97,1628.66,1635.767,The legislator adopted changes to transportation policy that I think are worth highlighting.,54,,
192,0.97,1635.767,1658.923,"Several bills that we were following throughout the legislative session and supporting got wrapped up into the move ahead Washington transportation revenue package that passed . from a local transportation revenue perspective, the move ahead Washington package authorized an additional 0.1% sales tax authority for transportation benefit districts.",54,,
193,0.97,1658.923,1667.599,That is an authority that would be in addition to the 0.2% voter approved authority that we already have.,54,,
194,0.97,1667.599,1685.65,The package also fixed a sort of ambiguity in state law that has been a concern to Sdot and others on how many times it can be renewed.,54,,
195,0.97,1685.65,1697.128,There was some interpretation from law and other cities and agreed that it could only be renewed once and then it would expire automatically.,54,,
196,0.97,1697.128,1704.836,"That has been clarified, so they cannot be renewed multiple times.",54,,
197,0.97,1704.836,1712.143,We no longer need to worry about that at the end of our current term.,54,,
198,0.97,1712.143,1719.651,The transportation package also made some changes to automated enforcement authority.,54,,
199,0.97,1719.651,1726.791,It extended our current automated pilot for transit lanes for two years.,54,,
200,0.97,1726.791,1733.264,That program is just getting underway at Sdot.,54,,
201,0.97,1733.264,1739.804,I believe they launched a handful of cameras last month after delays related to the Covid-19 pandemic.,54,,
202,0.97,1739.804,1760.525,This provides an additional two years for us to collect the data and report back on what we saw through the program without needing to feel the crunch of doing that in just a handful of months.,54,,
203,0.97,1760.525,1762.026,It created new authority for automated enforcement.,54,,
204,0.97,1762.026,1773.705,"It authorizes speed cameras in school walk zones and hospital speed zones . It allows cities to use one speed camera per 10,000 population.",54,,
205,0.97,1773.705,1784.449,"The city of Seattle would be authorized to use, you know, approximately 70 speed zone cameras as part of this proposal.",54,,
206,0.97,1784.449,1803.501,In addition to those sort of policies that were adopted through the revenue package were two other pretty big transportation and transportation and labor policy packages adopted.,54,,
207,0.97,1803.501,1808.339,House bill 2076 concerns Ransportation network companies.,54,,
208,0.97,1808.339,1825.49,"It did pass . that bill establishes a statewide regulatory framework including statewide worker classification for drivers, minimum compensation, worker's compensation.",54,,
209,0.97,1825.49,1849.247,"It does Unfortunately preempt the city with regards to labor standards, so while we will be seeing a statewide system set up, we will no longer be able to do the enforcement that was housed . We did secure delays to the $0.15 reduction in our local fees.",54,,
210,0.97,1849.247,1859.057,That will be transferred to Fnd a statewide drivers resource centers.,54,,
211,0.97,1859.057,1861.626,"Instead of taking effect immediately, those will not take effect until 2023.",54,,
212,0.97,1861.626,1873.771,"We were also signaled the ability to adjust our--not our local fee, but our regulatory fees, the ones collected to license the industry.",54,,
213,0.97,1873.771,1890.288,"Finally, Senate bill 5528. this was the revised and updated of 1304 from the last legislative session.",54,,
214,0.97,1890.288,1900.865,The sound transit board and municipality within the sound transit service area to establish what is called an enhanced service zone.,54,,
215,0.97,1900.865,1920.351,"In an enhanced service zone, the governing body of the enhanced service zone and municipality can put a valid matter authorizing an additional parking tax and motor vehicle tax of 1.5%.",54,,
216,0.97,1920.351,1929.694,"Those funds can be used defined enhancements to existing light rail systems, construction of new lines, and or future planning.",54,,
217,0.97,1929.694,1941.873,"That bill was approved, so that is now an authority that the city of Seattle has in partnership with the sound transit board.",54,,
218,0.97,1941.873,1949.18,I will pause there for any questions on the transportation side.,54,,
219,0.97,1949.18,1950.615,I am just happy this past.,55,,
220,0.97,1950.615,1952.984,I want to really thank Senator Pedersen for that.,55,,
221,0.97,1952.984,1954.485,He worked with us on that.,55,,
222,0.97,1954.485,1963.194,This will be a wonderful tool for the city of Seattle in light of sound transit and the realignment in the issues we are dealing with right now.,55,,
223,0.97,1963.194,1972.971,I think this is a wonderful tool for local government and particularly Seattle.,55,,
224,0.97,1972.971,1974.372,I don't see any other questions.,55,,
225,0.97,1974.372,1976.808,All right.,56,,
226,0.97,1976.808,1979.11,That concludes the highlights that we wanted to cover.,56,,
227,0.97,1979.11,1991.255,"Obviously there is a lot more detail in these documents, so I think we will open it up to any questions you have for us and we can work to address those.",56,,
228,0.97,1991.255,1993.291,Does anyone have questions they want to ask?,57,,
229,0.97,1993.291,1995.693,I was going to say Gael and friends.,57,,
230,0.97,1995.693,2002.834,"[Laughter] Councilmember Mosqueda, do have something for us?",57,,

232,0.97,2009.34,2026.858,"I know we have already said that a number of times, but in this final presentation, we thank you for all of the work you have done in the legislative session and the sessions before that that were also Transitioning to, you know, through the pandemic year and the midst of the pandemic and it doing this really heroic work in the beginning months of the new administration.",58,,

234,0.97,2030.728,2043.674,"Especially when you look at the budget, there are so many important funding streams coming into our region that you noted.",58,,
235,0.97,2043.674,2056.254,Some of which I am hoping can offset some of the ways Seattle as stepped in and provided additional support in the midst of the pandemic . We are seeing the state legislator bring back some of the programs and expanding those because of the great efficacy.,58,,
236,0.97,2056.254,2057.755,This will help our region and residents.,58,,
237,0.97,2057.755,2068.633,"Thank you for all of that work and the tough negotiations you did on a number of bills . all of that work is noticed and seen and greatly appreciated, so thank you very much for your team and to you as well.",58,,

They had to make a lot of decisions on dealing with the pandemic and our team here, including our contract lobbyists who are working on the ground virtually in Olympia with us, and for all of you to make sure that priorities of this city were consistently and effectively and very intentionally weighing in on the final decisions that had to be made in a really short period of time.",59,,
241,0.97,2127.325,2140.738,This is the last presentation to the Council regarding the state activities until Quinn and Elsa start gearing up with your staff and with the city Department to starting about 2023.,59,,

244,0.97,2172.236,2186.45,"The only thing I would do a follow-up, which will probably do with you Online, but the Preempts with the city has done.",60,,
245,0.97,2186.45,2189.287,"Sometimes when Seattle passes laws and it goes statewide, it is a good thing.",60,,
246,0.97,2189.287,2195.993,I think a good example is the $15 minimum wage.,60,,
247,0.97,2195.993,2197.595,Sometimes we see it go the other way.,60,,
248,0.97,2197.595,2211.842,I will be looking to you guys to help me walk through the policy of that gap in between of how we settle the estate law with the city law coming up with other things I see coming over the horizon.,60,,

305,0.97,2684.314,2689.586,The only thing I will take issue with is the characterization.,66,,
306,0.97,2689.586,2691.755,These are not new observations from myself or Councilmembers.,66,,
307,0.97,2691.755,2705.035,"I think in Council briefing, I know speaking for myself, these are things I have been saying since at least August of last year, so I don't know how new this is as something we have been discussing.",66,,
308,0.97,2705.035,2736.1,"I would also say that I don't think that the remedy that Paul and Danny reported on, the fact we don't have similar issues related to crime and disorder in tiny House villages and supportive shelters does further improve that our neighbors experiencing homelessness when given a place to live that is dignified and that is humane are good neighbors.",66,,
309,0.97,2736.1,2791.789,"In every neighborhood in my district where we have one of these sheltering options, there has been no presentation of public safety issues as a result of having our neighbors who used to be in Encampments and are now in the same dignified place to live . I did just want to also highlight that I could share an anecdote on all eight of my colleagues on the Council and their commitment to building and expanding those kinds of interventions and, you know, I don't know that enough credit or Association is always given to what those efforts have done . If it weren't for the efforts of this Council, Ballard park would still be an encampment today.",66,,
310,0.97,2791.789,2797.861,The people living there would be not living in a door that locks and four walls.,66,,
311,0.97,2797.861,2799.696,They would be living in a tent.,66,,
312,0.97,2799.696,2803.734,There would still be an encampment on third Avenue.,66,,
313,0.97,2803.734,2809.94,There would be an encampment at Interlake.,66,,
314,0.97,2809.94,2816.113,This Council saw those Encampments as is inhumane places to live.,66,,
315,0.97,2816.113,2831.195,We worked hard to get them staffed and to get people in them . I look forward to continuing this discussion on April 20th . I was very encouraged to read in the news over the weekend detailing the Mayor's first 100 days in office.,66,,

318,0.97,2842.339,2861.625,"We have seen from last fall to the present day that when we have those placements, we are able to offer people experiencing homelessness in these Encampments a desirable Plce to go . that is to the benefit of everyone in the community.",66,,
319,0.97,2861.625,2870.5,To our constituents experiencing homelessness and our constituents who are housed . I look forward to continuing that work.,66,,

325,0.97,2913.443,2917.18,"I hope I'm not stealing your thunder, but it was in our newsletter with regards to the libraries.",67,,
326,0.97,2917.18,2928.425,"The Seattle public library sharing positive results with it a little decision to eliminate fines from his overdue items . If you remember from last year, we made the decision to eliminate fines and some people went crazy over that.",67,,

328,0.97,2929.693,2936.566,This change was made possible by the $219 million passed by the voters in August of 2019.,67,,
329,0.97,2936.566,2941.305,The positive results are long overdue.,67,,
330,0.97,2941.305,2963.56,"Lost items have decreased significantly by 38% . So, what we found out is it was a good thing to do that and we have more people using the library and as I said, having overdue books and items have decreased significantly, over 38%.",67,,
331,0.97,2963.56,2972.536,Overdue items went from 10% to 5%.,67,,
332,0.97,2972.536,2973.537,It was a good thing.,67,,

391,0.97,3499.929,3512.075,I think it'll be a good combination between the presentation on that topic and the overall presentation on American rescue plan act dollars and how we are doing with allocating the funding that the previous administration has approved.,73,,

404,0.97,3656.352,3672.101,This Council is the opportunity for us as a Council along with the executive and members of the public to get in real time joint updates on what the revenue forecast looks like instead of having that information just be digested within the budget office.,73,,
405,0.97,3672.101,3686.549,"This is an opportunity for us to use a revenue forecast Council process similar to King County, similar to the state that has the lead program and independent revenue forecast office as well.",73,,
406,0.97,3686.549,3700.563,We had a great conversation on Friday last week and accepted the forecast at the office presented to the Council.,73,,

410,0.97,3726.956,3738.968,"There has been an increase of $57.3 million in Non-General Fund . of course, that includes things like Jumpstart.",73,,
411,0.97,3738.968,3743.673,The Non-General fund dollars are dollars specifically allocated for specific purposes.,73,,
412,0.97,3743.673,3761.457,"I am distinguishing between the $32.5 million, which is great news and in addition to that $57.3 million for a Non-General Fund . I want to note this picture is not complete because there are revenue sources which remain within the budget office.",73,,
413,0.97,3761.457,3775.304,The CBO will be coming to the committee meeting next week to provide an overall forecast for the rest of the revenue streams . We will get that information on April 20th.,73,,
414,0.97,3775.304,3784.247,"Again, to see a fuller picture on what this means for the forecasting, not just for 2022 and what's available for us in terms of meeting the need for this year and how we prepare for 2023 and 2024.",73,,
415,0.97,3784.247,3794.056,I will also NOTE much of the forecasting is still volatile given the International uncertainty and increased expenses.,73,,
416,0.97,3794.056,3805.568,That includes the ongoing wars across the globe and increased expenses such as interest rates . The city faces a revenue gap.,73,,
417,0.97,3805.568,3822.618,"I won't call it a shortfall, but a revenue gap in long-term needs and short-term revenue sources to fill those needs, many of which we have been able to address not just with Jumpstart but the American rescue plan act dollars.",73,,
418,0.97,3822.618,3845.374,"Investments in our community through it Jumpstart Seattle's progressive revenue tax is helping to not only keep the trains running but provide core services and keep people employed, direct workers and into our smallest businesses, which has helped to generate greater economic activity.",73,,
419,0.97,3845.374,3865.494,"I will also note that the inclusion of Jumpstart Seattle in the revenue forecast this year allowed for us to see that there is a projected increase of close to $44 million for the projections for 2022, bringing the total for Jumpstart revenue to $277 million.",73,,
420,0.97,3865.494,3886.449,"As folks were reporting out, there is a lot to be figured out in terms of how the return to work ends up settling down for some of the Industries seeing the largest increases in economic activity as specifically information technology.",73,,
421,0.97,3886.449,3895.992,There is a lot to sort of see how in a hopefully one day post Covid world how this all settles out.,73,,
422,0.97,3895.992,3901.03,"As was noted in the presentation, even the pessimistic forecast for Jumpstart makes me optimistic.",73,,
423,0.97,3901.03,3903.733,"I want to repeat that because at this point, it is $277 million.",73,,
424,0.97,3903.733,3913.843,We will have more updates for April 20th to look at the fuller revenue picture again.,73,,
