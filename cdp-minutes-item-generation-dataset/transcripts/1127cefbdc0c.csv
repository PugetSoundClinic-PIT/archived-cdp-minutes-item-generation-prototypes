33,0.97,165.398,178.478,"It's almost like nowadays you're paying your rent to be sabotaging and killed and in your unit and I don't appreciate that, okay?",17,,
34,0.97,178.478,188.521,I'm speaking out about it so enough people regulating time down here should know about the situation and sit should have moved in on the situation by now.,17,,
35,0.97,188.521,196.062,So I see we have to treat these situations like what happened with Trump.,17,,
36,0.97,196.062,201.134,"You know, I would feel sorry for anybody that would have to be locked up in prison or jail.",17,,

40,0.97,226.559,226.859,Federal law.,17,,
41,0.97,226.859,241.874,"So I feel like there should be a mandate already set in a system already set up not only for homelessness, because when people go out there they're cleaning up mess.",17,,
42,0.97,241.874,248.514,I'm not talking about people individually because God loves everybody but I'm talking about the stuff going on.,17,,
43,0.97,248.514,258.625,People are out in the streets often times because they live up under slum Lords for so long they didn't have nowhere else to go but the streets.,17,,
44,0.97,258.625,264.497,And so we have to have somebody to change the system that it works for everybody.,17,,
45,0.97,264.497,268.201,Not just telling them people that they can go into a hotel and live.,17,,

54,0.97,320.586,322.255,"Well, it should say credit.",19,,
55,0.97,322.255,325.992,Balance due on statements means you owe that amount.,19,,
56,0.97,325.992,333.666,"And when I inquire of the managers, I'm simply told it's a Glitch in the system and they are correcting it.",19,,
57,0.97,333.666,338.538,It shouldn't have reached me if it's a Glitch in the system.,19,,
58,0.97,338.538,358.091,"This has been going on on for two months and because I protest against Seattle police who are loud and frequent and live on the premises, I am operated against and I things happen to me.",19,,

72,0.97,433.432,437.637,Hundreds of members and thousands of followers on social media share my enthusiasm.,21,,
73,0.97,437.637,444.377,I am well aware the risks of acute and chronic conditions that Blowers cause for the workers who use them.,21,,
74,0.97,444.377,453.553,And this as well as noise should be at the top of list of harms as we consider this resolution.,21,,
75,0.97,453.553,456.756,Then with the many environmental issues these machines present.,21,,
76,0.97,456.756,463.029,Using two stroke engines makes them serious sources of air pollution.,21,,
77,0.97,463.029,470.369,Running one Emits as much smog forming pollution as driving from here to La according to the California resources board.,21,,
78,0.97,470.369,476.809,"Further mother, the green House gas emissions while comparatively minor are measurable.",21,,
79,0.97,476.809,484.817,Another California study shows a typical gas blower emitting 150 metric tons of Co2 a year.,21,,
80,0.97,484.817,489.021,My main grievance is their threat to Wildlivs.,21,,
81,0.97,489.021,495.661,Blowers frighten birds and beneficial insects and disrupt or destroy their habitat.,21,,
82,0.97,495.661,496.429,Leave the leaves.,21,,

87,0.97,510.91,513.145,Not filling their gas tanks.,21,,
88,0.97,513.145,522.088,Your wise and timely resolution encourages the city to eventually phase out both kinds of leave Blowers gas and electric.,21,,
89,0.97,522.088,533.533,All Blowers are power hungry at a time when we much make greater to reserve energy.,21,,
90,0.97,533.533,537.336,This resolution is an essential first step for a quiet and clean Seattle.,21,,

96,0.97,559.525,560.159,Seattle is behind.,23,,
97,0.97,560.159,571.003,"Cities in Colorado, California, Texas and Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey, New York and Vermont have banned or limited their use.",23,,
98,0.97,571.003,578.978,Jay Ensly banned their use at the Capitol in 2014 saying they're too loud and not green enough.,23,,
99,0.97,578.978,588.421,Carlisle before he left office proposed a cash for lawn Clun Kers bill which would provide $200 to purchase cleaner machines.,23,,
100,0.97,588.421,591.057,I just don't see the down side.,23,,
101,0.97,591.057,603.836,Landscapers will still have jobs healthier ones and I have a feeling Oprah's yard in Sanitizer Barbara where they're banned is still lovely.,23,,

106,0.97,618.985,620.252,Gas Blowers ruin communities.,25,,
107,0.97,620.252,623.856,This is in support of resolution 32064.,25,,
108,0.97,623.856,632.865,"Whether you are young, old, poor or rich, there's a gas blower nearby you're negatively impacted by the noise, dust and Fos Sul fuel emissions.",25,,
109,0.97,632.865,647.246,The emissions are especially bad because most gas Blowers are two stroke engines meaning they burn a mixture of motor oil and gasoline all with 0 emission controls look your car.,25,,
110,0.97,647.246,655.454,"Ultra fine particular matter emitted from fossil fuel combustion causes numerous health issues and responsible for 300,000 death ace year in the U.S.",25,,
111,0.97,655.454,663.996,More than Covid in each of the last three years and most are from marginalized communities.,25,,
112,0.97,663.996,667.299,Landscapers Inhale these Pollutants more than anyone else.,25,,
113,0.97,667.299,671.37,No one has ever added the words bring that gas blower over towards me.,25,,
114,0.97,671.37,671.804,Always the opposite.,25,,
115,0.97,671.804,676.075,I hope they go the other way or stop soon.,25,,
116,0.97,676.075,682.948,Through double pain windows on the other side of our home I can hear the wailing chasing leaves off the gas.,25,,
117,0.97,682.948,689.555,This is because they have a far greater low frequent sound and transmit over long distances.,25,,
118,0.97,689.555,699.899,A gas blower can be heard by the nearest 90 homes and that's even more with Multiunit dwellings but won't Landscapers lose jobs?,25,,
119,0.97,699.899,700.266,Absolutely not.,25,,
120,0.97,700.266,703.903,"In fact, it will be the opposite.",25,,
121,0.97,703.903,705.304,They will save money.,25,,
122,0.97,705.304,717.249,Anyone who claims Electrics aren't powerful enough must not be aware the fastest production car in the world at 0-60 miles in 2 seconds is 100% battery powered.,25,,
123,0.97,717.249,729.495,A recent June 2022 study showed only a ten month pay back for an extremely powerful leaf blower and we can agree most Landscapers could cut back on blowing.,25,,
124,0.97,729.495,732.865,Do we really need to blow empty parking lots?,25,,
125,0.97,732.865,744.043,The California board banned all gas Blowers in the entire state and other emissions because they emit more pollution than the 16 million cars.,25,,
126,0.97,744.043,747.179,"Please support Councilmember Alex Pedersen resolution 32064, thank you.",25,,
127,0.97,747.513,770.503,"Our speakers signed up Online are Michael Ruby followed by wood Y Wheeler, Nicole grant and Sheila Bishop who is not present.",26,,
128,0.97,770.503,770.87,So Michael Ruby.,26,,
129,0.97,770.87,773.239,.,26,,
130,0.97,773.239,776.342,"Good morning, Mike Ruby from walling Ford.",27,,
131,0.97,776.342,787.353,Today I'm addressing the proposed resolution on the phased out of gasoline leaf Blowers.,27,,
132,0.97,787.353,793.159,I'm the original author of Seattle's noise control ordinance.,27,,
133,0.97,793.159,806.438,One of our outreach efforts was a request through neighborhood newspapers for folks to submit a coupon with their noise annoy Yanss and remember in the early 1970s every neighborhood in Seattle had a local newspaper.,27,,
134,0.97,806.438,816.816,I remember one of the most frequent comments was the noise from leaf Blowers especially early on a weekend morning.,27,,
135,0.97,816.816,819.185,That has not changed.,27,,
136,0.97,819.185,825.424,"All these years later, two cycle leave Blowers are still one of the most annoying noise sources in the city.",27,,
137,0.97,825.424,833.032,I suspect all of you had the four cycles of an internal combustion engine described to you.,27,,
138,0.97,833.032,842.408,The last cycle is the exhaust of the combustion gases but the two cycle skips the steps to create a much cheaper to build engine.,27,,
139,0.97,842.408,847.479,The exhaust contains for more unburned Hydro carbons and it's just down right dangerous.,27,,
140,0.97,847.479,855.254,Today we are also worried about the green House gas emissions causing these heat waves we are enjoying this summer.,27,,
141,0.97,855.254,866.265,Emission inventory studies have found these small engines are actually a major source of green House gas emissions in large part because of their Two-Cycle design.,27,,
142,0.97,866.265,872.404,The proposed resolution this morning is a timid Seattle process step along this road.,27,,
143,0.97,872.404,881.547,The dates for achieving change are far in the future but at least it does ask the executive to respond this year with a program for achieving the phase out.,27,,
144,0.97,881.547,892.758,I urge you to move this timid but important step forward today by voting this resolution out of committee this morning.,27,,
145,0.97,892.758,893.259,Thank you.,27,,
146,0.97,893.392,907.072,"Our next Speaker is Woody Wheeler followed by Nicole grant, followed by Sheila Bishop who is still not present.",27,,
147,0.97,907.072,911.076,Woody you're showing up as muted.,28,,
148,0.97,911.076,911.61,Hit Star 6 to Unmute yourself.,28,,

152,0.97,920.653,930.963,"Thank you Councilmembers, my name is Woody Wheeler and I support enthusiastically resolution 3206.",31,,
153,0.97,930.963,931.297,Consider this.,31,,
154,0.97,931.297,951.216,"Hydrocarbon emissions from just half an hour of yard work with a two stroke gas powered leaf blower are about the same as a 3,000 mile drive from Texas to Alaska in a 6,000 Ford F-150 Svp Raptor Ick up truck.",31,,
155,0.97,951.216,958.09,"This shocking analysis came from Jason Cavanaugh, engineering editor at Edmund's car company.",31,,
156,0.97,958.09,967.866,"Margaret wrinkle OPP Ed writer if the New York Times wrote, ""the gasoline powered leave blower exists in a category of environmental hell all its own.",31,,
157,0.97,967.866,980.679,"Spewing along with Deafening noise and clouds of dust, other Pollutants, carbon Monoxide smog forming Oxided and Carson Generalic Hydro carbons"".",31,,
158,0.97,980.679,985.551,Gas powered leave Blowers invade the neighborhood weekly filling the air the noise pollution.,31,,
159,0.97,985.551,992.558,My wife and I work at home but cannot make calls or participate in zoom meetings while they roar outside the window.,31,,
160,0.97,992.558,994.326,We often leave home to get way from them.,31,,
161,0.97,994.326,1001.633,We are on the verge of banning this extremely inappropriate Tech Nol in Seattle.,31,,
162,0.97,1001.633,1011.944,Fortunately alternatives exist to gas powered leave Blowers specifically electronic leave Blowers but also old fashion Rakes and brooms which I still use in our yard work.,31,,
163,0.97,1011.944,1018.45,80% of those surveyed in Councilmember Alex Pedersen's district agree that we should ban gas powered leave Blowers.,31,,
164,0.97,1018.45,1030.095,"More than 100 other cities have already done so at a time when climate change is happening here and now, Seattle should ban them too.",31,,
165,0.97,1030.095,1030.662,Vote yes on resolution 3206.,31,,
166,0.97,1030.662,1030.863,Thank you.,31,,

172,0.97,1057.79,1059.458,We're a climate activist organization.,33,,
173,0.97,1059.458,1094.393,"We're about a lot of things--supporting social housing, we're about no Amazon warehouse on Rainier Avenue, we're about a parks levy that builds climate resilience hubs in our parks for climate emergencies like heat waves and Wildfire smoke, and we have a lot of admiration for the activists that were arrested in Senator Patty Murray's office last night standing up against oil Tycoons.",33,,
174,0.97,1094.393,1107.673,So a lot of things and we're also about number 32064 bill ending leaf Blowers.,33,,
175,0.97,1107.673,1117.149,If someone kicked one off in or near Council chambers right now it would be so upsetting.,33,,
176,0.97,1117.149,1118.35,They are Excruciatingly loud.,33,,
177,0.97,1118.35,1126.024,They put out an exhaust that is toxic.,33,,
178,0.97,1126.024,1131.263,And when there are electric alternatives 350 Seattle demands them.,33,,
179,0.97,1131.263,1145.01,I was a worker at King County parks previously in my career and that's the reason that I personally in my heart don't like leave Blowers.,33,,
180,0.97,1145.01,1156.755,"The gas on your hands when you're fuelling and Refuelling, seeping into your skin, the weight on your back, the noise in your ears.",33,,
181,0.97,1156.755,1162.528,And the exhaust in your lungs and we're over that technology.,33,,
182,0.97,1162.528,1165.364,We don't need it anymore.,33,,
183,0.97,1165.364,1167.633,"And that's why we support this effort, thanks.",33,,
184,0.97,1167.966,1185.851,"Our final Speaker, Sheila Bishop is not present so Sheila, if you're listening you can Email Councilmembers Council at Seattle.Gov.",34,,
185,0.97,1185.851,1190.255,If there are no more present speakers signed up for public comment.,34,,
186,0.97,1190.255,1194.993,Okay thank you Ted and thank you to all the community members who spoke in public comment.,35,,
187,0.97,1194.993,1199.831,We will now begin the discussion of the gas powered leaf blower resolution.,35,,
188,0.97,1199.831,1204.469,I will read the resolution into the record now.,35,,
189,0.97,1204.469,1216.081,Resolution 32064 a resolution declaring the city council's Intents to phase out gas powered leaf Blowers establishing goals and identifying actions to meet these goals.,35,,
190,0.97,1216.081,1226.258,"Councilmember Alex Pedersen has sponsored this legislation, would you like to say a few words to begin this discussion and then introduce the Presenters?",35,,
191,0.97,1226.258,1228.093,Thank you chair Kshama Sawant.,36,,
192,0.97,1228.093,1246.578,I really want to thank you for enabling us to discuss and hopefully vote today on this resolution to phase out gasoline powered leaf Blowers.,36,,
193,0.97,1246.578,1255.12,"While increasing community safety, I'm confident City Hall has the band Withto address this too.",36,,
194,0.97,1255.12,1256.154,The science is clear.,36,,
195,0.97,1256.154,1264.129,These fossil fuel machines with their toxic fumes and dirty debris harm the workers who operate them and the communities that endure them.,36,,
196,0.97,1264.129,1278.343,We have an extensive list of information sources attached to today's agenda and I want to thank the University of Washington Evans school graduate students for skillfully supplementing our research.,36,,
197,0.97,1278.343,1279.411,The public opinion is clear.,36,,
198,0.97,1279.411,1290.322,In just the past 48 hours over 100 residents took time from their busy days to send E-Mails and make public comment in favor of the resolution.,36,,
199,0.97,1290.322,1302.267,Informal survey of my constituents last month show 82% of those who responded want to outright ban gas powered leaf Blowers and local environmental justice organizations support the resolution.,36,,
200,0.97,1302.267,1304.97,The trend across the nation is clear.,36,,
201,0.97,1304.97,1320.152,"Over 100 jurisdictions have banned or phasing out gas powered leave Blowers while Seattle prides itself on being a leader on many issues, we are behind on addressing the Harms of leaf Blowers.",36,,
202,0.97,1320.152,1322.988,All of California and Vermont have left us in the dust.,36,,
203,0.97,1322.988,1326.692,We'll be hearing from one jurisdiction today on how they got it done.,36,,
204,0.97,1326.692,1342.841,I'm confident that our Seattle government departments that care about reducing Pollutin and care about protecting workers and have the power to stop using gas powered leaf Blowers will be inspired to act on this joint resolution.,36,,
205,0.97,1342.841,1347.346,To make real progress on this environmental and public health concern.,36,,
206,0.97,1347.346,1354.386,"And as we make the city government lead by example, there will be plenty of time for the private market to follow.",36,,
207,0.97,1354.386,1360.792,Whether that's switching to electric and battery powered leaf Blowers or just using a rake.,36,,
208,0.97,1360.792,1374.74,"To be clear, the resolution calls for ending the Yoos of gas powered leaf Blowers in city government by January 2025 and ending the use of gas powered leaf Blowers elsewhere in the city by January 2027.",36,,
209,0.97,1374.74,1389.988,The resolutions consistent with past policy statements from the city council but a resolution imply Fews them and hopefully louder than the noise of leaf Blowers and the resolution also updates and expands this effort to finally spur action.,36,,
210,0.97,1389.988,1390.422,Fall is coming.,36,,
211,0.97,1390.422,1398.997,"The season of falling leaves is coming and with it, the harmful sound, toxic fumes and filthy debris of these terrible machines.",36,,
212,0.97,1398.997,1402.601,This issue is delayed for far too long by the pandemic.,36,,
213,0.97,1402.601,1413.011,Our resolutions consistent with past policy statements and it's needed to make progress to work out the details to Fanlly rid our cities of these dirty fossil fuel machines.,36,,
214,0.97,1413.011,1414.646,"Please vote today and vote yes, thank you.",36,,
215,0.97,1414.98,1419.084,.,36,,
216,0.97,1419.084,1423.955,Thank you Councilmember Alex Pedersen for that description.,37,,
217,0.97,1423.955,1424.189,Yolanda?,37,,
218,0.97,1424.189,1433.265,Thank you chair Kshama Sawant and I am happy to introduce those who are here at the committee as well.,38,,
219,0.97,1433.265,1434.199,Please do.,39,,
220,0.97,1434.199,1441.973,First of course we'll have Yolanda hull from city council central staff who will be here.,40,,
221,0.97,1441.973,1450.148,We have an official from Washington D.C. that has successfully banned leaf Blowers already.,40,,
222,0.97,1450.148,1456.254,And I think that's who we have today.,40,,
223,0.97,1456.254,1463.361,I know it's important for Councilmembers to hear what other cities have done so we have a person from DC who knows the most.,40,,
224,0.97,1463.361,1469.367,"We can start with central staff and her presentation, if that makes sense.",40,,
225,0.97,1469.367,1473.438,"All right, thank you so much.",41,,
226,0.97,1473.438,1482.747,"Yolanda Council central staff, let me get my presentation on this screen.",41,,
227,0.97,1482.747,1502.267,"All right, so we are here today to talk about resolution 32064 and just to give you an overview of what I will be going through, this will be following the content that was in the memo I provided yesterday to the committee.",41,,
228,0.97,1502.267,1536.234,We are going to talk about the environmental health impacts many of which you heard through public comments and talk about some of the city's efforts related to gas powered leaf Blowers and current regulations and just generally how many are owned by the city and briefly touch on other jurisdictions including just a kick overview of DC's efforts and then Provoud an overview of the resolution and some considerations about implementation of the work requested.,41,,
229,0.97,1536.234,1545.744,So for decades gas powered leaf Blowers have been considered a source of nuisance and noise ever since they were invented I think in the 70s.,41,,
230,0.97,1545.744,1557.222,So it has resulted on restrictions of use in many municipalities.,41,,
231,0.97,1557.222,1563.895,More recently research revealed it can have adverse Impa pacts.,41,,
232,0.97,1563.895,1578.243,Nationally landscape workers are Disportion Natalie identify as Latino or Hispanic and 46% in the landscaping services verses 18% in the total work force.,41,,
233,0.97,1578.243,1607.806,"As noted by one of the Commenters, gas powered leaf Blowers particularly the most common, the Two-Stroke engine produces a low frequency sound that electric leaf Blowers do not that can travel through building walls and is perceived by the human ear as particularly disruptive and can be quite distracting in trying to do your day-to-day work if there's a leaf blower operating nearby.",41,,
234,0.97,1607.806,1619.584,They are also louder than electric leaf Blowers so someone who is operating the equipment without proper hearing protection could end up with permanent hearing damage.,41,,
235,0.97,1619.584,1643.108,"In regard to the emissions of gas powered leaf Blowers, they do contribute green House gas emissions but compared to buildings and transportation, it's pretty negligible but again, not using less gas will Ergo fewer green House gas emissions.",41,,
236,0.97,1643.108,1661.726,But more Impactful on people's health is that they do emit emissions from the burnt and Unburnt gas which can produce ozone and release toxins like carbon Monoxide and Formaldehyde that can cause cancer and respiratory problems.,41,,
237,0.97,1661.726,1683.815,"Additionally, all leaf Blowers whether gas or electric lift particulate matter into the air and exposure to that also known as PM 2.5 has been shown to cause negative cardiovascular health that can lead to premature death and linked to adverse birth outcomes and cancer.",41,,
238,0.97,1683.815,1688.42,So on to some previous policy efforts by the city.,41,,
239,0.97,1688.42,1713.211,Council interest in furthering restriction of the use of gas leaf Blowers was initiated in 2014 with the statement of legislative intent that requested that then the Department of planning and development which is now the Seattle Department of construction and inspections proposed recommendations for reducing emissions and noise from gas powered leaf Blowers.,41,,
240,0.97,1713.211,1733.364,The departments we call the statements of legislative intent slide so the slide response provided nd evaluation of the potential pros and cons of restricting use of gas powered leaf Blowers and ultimately recommended regulatory changes because they were not effective for commercial use.,41,,
241,0.97,1733.364,1742.34,They noted prohibiting the use of gas powered leaf Blowers would create racial equity issues.,41,,
242,0.97,1742.34,1751.583,They suggested they modify procurement practices and improve communication between departments and the general public about best practices for leaf Blowers.,41,,
243,0.97,1751.583,1777.242,"So following up on the sly, four years later the Council added funding for a position in Sdci to support various projects including a recommended action from the 2014 sly response related to communicating these best practices to the general public and in the landscaping industry which resulted in the creation of a best practices guide to encourage more responsible courteous leaf blower use.",41,,
244,0.97,1777.242,1802.267,"More recently as part of the 2022 adopted budget, the Council included a sly by Councilmember Alex Pedersen requesting the office of Sustainability and environment and parks and recreation develop a plan to phase out the use of all gas powered leaf Blowers in Seattle in two years and that response is due late next month.",41,,
245,0.97,1802.267,1809.04,"So currently, the city regulates leaf blower use through its noise code which is administered by SDI.",41,,
246,0.97,1809.04,1818.249,Use of leaf Blowers is limited to certain hours that vary by zoning category.,41,,
247,0.97,1818.249,1820.718,Most restrictive in the residential Zonings.,41,,
248,0.97,1820.718,1831.095,"And normal operation of gas powered leaf Blowers during loud hours is generally in compliance, just as a right.",41,,
249,0.97,1831.095,1837.902,Only someone operating a leaf blower outside of the hours is likely to be in violation.,41,,
250,0.97,1837.902,1844.442,Sdci will only investigate Complaunts against landscaping companies but will not respond to complaints between neighbors.,41,,
251,0.97,1844.442,1866.531,The 2014 response noted that the city received few leaf blower complaints over the year and currently no longer tracks leaf blower complaints but noted a general increase in noise complaints over the past couple years as people have been at home more due to the pandemic.,41,,
252,0.97,1866.531,1874.639,This table shows the city's current inventory of gas and electric leaf Blowers as compared to what was included in the 2014 sly response.,41,,
253,0.97,1874.639,1888.753,You will note that we have generally increased our number of Blowers and you have more electric leaf Blowers as compared to 2014 but also more gas powered.,41,,
254,0.97,1888.753,1893.825,The largest inventory and increase is seen in Seattle parks and Rec.,41,,
255,0.97,1893.825,1915.313,It's used by staff to maintain our various lands and courts and departments continue to rely on gas leaf Blowers because they are more efficient and can be better to use than electric versions which continue to have limited battery life.,41,,
256,0.97,1915.313,1940.171,In 2019 parks conducted a pilot program to test battery powered electric leaf Blowers and found the technology has improved such that they work well in dry conditions on hard surfaces or the heavy wet leaf litter in the fall contained to be slightly beyond the capabilities of this equipment so thus staff are continuing to use the gas versions.,41,,
257,0.97,1940.171,1954.419,But parks has also committed to Transitioning to more electric leaf Blowers with the goal of reaching 50% electric by 2026.,41,,
258,0.97,1954.419,1964.796,"As I mentioned before, gas powered leaf Blowers became popular in the 1970s and not longer after, restrictions followed.",41,,
259,0.97,1964.796,1969.5,Many jurisdictions and dozens of states have taken action to regulate leaf blower noise.,41,,
260,0.97,1969.5,1974.339,Most of them limit the hours or seasons in which leaf Blowers may be used.,41,,
261,0.97,1974.339,1985.717,A smaller number have banned the use of gas powered leaf Blowers and half have banned it entirely.,41,,
262,0.97,1985.717,2001.599,"A few examples are in Washington D.C., the Council of the District of Columbia passed a bill in 2018 to ban the use of gas powered leaf Blowers in January of this year.",41,,
263,0.97,2001.599,2009.707,It was to allow residents to transition to electric leaf blower in advance of the law going into affect.,41,,
264,0.97,2009.707,2014.345,There's a fine of $500 per occurrence.,41,,
265,0.97,2014.345,2037.702,"Closer to Seattle, Multinoma County including the city of Portland adopted a resolution late last year committing to transition to electric by December 2024 and convening a Washg group in partnership with Portland to develop an equitable strategy that will result in a county wide phase out of leaf blower.",41,,
266,0.97,2037.702,2039.27,Sorry to interrupt your flow.,42,,
267,0.97,2039.27,2052.617,Do you have any sense of the time frame that these jurisdictions gave to their own city departments to phase this out?,42,,
268,0.97,2052.617,2064.929,"So for Multiinoma County, they have until December 2024 they had a goal of 2025 so they are accelerating by a year.",43,,
269,0.97,2064.929,2069.867,So they are giving their departments a couple years at this point.,43,,
270,0.97,2069.867,2071.836,But for others I'm not sure about.,43,,
271,0.97,2071.836,2077.942,I think some are around the two or three year mark.,43,,
272,0.97,2077.942,2082.98,Seems to be the standard.,43,,
273,0.97,2082.98,2086.417,"Okay, thank you.",44,,
274,0.97,2086.417,2097.428,And in terms of the strategy for a county wise phase out of gas powered leaf blower no time for that with Portland because that process is underway.,45,,
275,0.97,2097.428,2109.273,And last year the state of California passed a bill to ban the sale of new gas powered lawn and garden equipment in 2024.,45,,
276,0.97,2109.273,2126.524,This does not prohibit the use of existing gas powered equipment but intended to lead to the full Electricfication of equipment.,45,,
277,0.97,2126.524,2132.497,And on to the resolution.,45,,
278,0.97,2132.497,2168.966,So this resolution 32064 is intended to elevate and reinforce the work requested by Councilmember Alex Pedersen in this year's adopted budget and would establish two goals that the city and contractors phase out the use of gas powered leaf blower by January 2025 or later and Seattle businesses operating in and Seattle residents will Fauz out the Yaus of gas powered leaf Blowers by January 2027.,45,,
279,0.97,2168.966,2177.542,Departments that use gas powered leaf Blowers evaluate current practices regarding the use and explore options to reduce reliance on the equipment.,45,,
280,0.97,2177.542,2187.485,This is accomplished by allowing leaves to remain in place rather than clearing them or using Rakes.,45,,
281,0.97,2187.485,2205.069,So also that these departments development and implement plans to insure facility employees are adequately equipped to use them and they can charge batteries and are trained to use the equipment.,45,,
282,0.97,2205.069,2245.676,And other requested actions are for the Department's listed on the slide here to develop and implement a culturally and Lingisticly outreach and Enl occasion strategy and community the Ng Tive impacts of gas powered leaf blower use and encouraging residents to use quieter alternatives and Sdci to develop proposal to phase out and eventually ban the use of all gas leaf Blowers in Seattle and that is requested to provide a proposed work program time line and budget to the Council December 2ND of this year.,45,,
283,0.97,2245.676,2250.748,"And finally, we have some considerations about the requested work.",45,,
284,0.97,2250.748,2274.271,Note Department staff indicated they do not have sufficient resources to conduct the requested actions and that adoption of this resolution could result in departments either shifting staff away from work on other city priorities to concentrate on this proposal or potentially for working on on the gas leaf blower phase out effort.,45,,
285,0.97,2274.271,2281.879,To encourage departments to Prioritize this work Koun Sul may want to consider adding resources for this effort in the forth coming deliberations.,45,,
286,0.97,2282.213,2286.651,"With that, I am done.",45,,
287,0.97,2286.984,2294.158,.,45,,
288,0.97,2294.158,2294.925,"Thank you, Yolanda",46,,
289,0.97,2294.925,2301.132,"Yes, chair Kshama Sawant and Yolanda and chair Kshama Sawant, I don't know if this is a good time.",47,,
290,0.97,2301.132,2312.51,If she's here the whole time in case we have questions but we do have the senior policy analyst from Washington D.C. who can tell us how they got it done there.,47,,
291,0.97,2312.51,2324.955,Michael Porcello is here with us as well as a Panelist if the chair would be okay hearing from him.,47,,
292,0.97,2324.955,2328.693,"Yes, definitely, please go ahead.",48,,
293,0.97,2328.693,2353.084,"Hi everyone, as the Councilmember said, my name is Michael Porcello and I serve as committee director for the Committee on transportation and the environment with the District of Columbia which is a Legislature for the city of Washington D.C. the committee of district including are Department of energy and environment which administers the District's climate, Sustainability and environmental health programs and services.",49,,
294,0.97,2353.084,2358.122,Thank you to the committee for inviting me to speak today on this important resolution.,49,,
295,0.97,2358.122,2365.429,It has been noted in 2018 the District passed a piece of legislation called the leaf blower regulation amendment act.,49,,
296,0.97,2365.429,2369.934,"It was introduced by the member I work directly for, Mary Cheh.",49,,
297,0.97,2369.934,2387.551,"As enacted it prohibited the sale or use of gasoline power leaf Blowers effective January 1, 2022, so it established a $500 fine for violations and stood up a small enforcement team in the local regulatory agency we call Dcra.",49,,
298,0.97,2387.551,2408.639,"A bit of background on the legislation, although the District's noise ordinance already sets a noise level threshold that applies to products like leaf Blowers, our office and others at the District of Columbia Council frequently heard from residents about the nuisance of gas powered leaf Blowers.",49,,
299,0.97,2408.639,2415.346,The current noise ordinance was not successful in addressing violations due to difficulty of enforcement.,49,,
300,0.97,2415.346,2429.46,"I can't speak to how enforcement works in Seattle but in DC, specific noise level limits are notoriously difficult to enforce because they have to be measured by a district official at the time they occur using a decimal meter.",49,,
301,0.97,2429.46,2434.398,If you're talking about a House party that's lasting for hours it's not that difficult.,49,,
302,0.97,2434.398,2444.341,But it's nearly impossible for leaf Blowers given landscape work takes less than an hour and enforcement officers couldn't get to the site on time.,49,,
303,0.97,2444.341,2447.511,There we're talking about the metropolitan police Department.,49,,
304,0.97,2447.511,2459.757,"So rather than rely on complaint based enforcement, the Legislature in DC explored whether outright prohibiting the sale and use of these leaf Blowers could be more effective.",49,,
305,0.97,2459.757,2460.858,It had several benefits.,49,,
306,0.97,2460.858,2465.663,"First, banning the sale helped because it simply reduced access to the products.",49,,
307,0.97,2465.663,2472.203,"Anyone seeking to replace or purchase a new leaf blower as of January now has one option, electric.",49,,
308,0.97,2472.203,2483.347,Of course that has limitations in the District as we're sandwiched between Virginia and Maryland and residents can go out of State to purchase a device that's not legally sold in the district.,49,,
309,0.97,2483.347,2489.153,I'm guessing Seattle faces similar issues with jurisdictions nearby but outside city limits.,49,,
310,0.97,2489.153,2497.228,This is an issue we face when we regulate products in a more restrictive manner in neighboring States and there's no easy answer to that.,49,,
311,0.97,2497.228,2503.801,"With that said, we found somebody has to be intent on getting a banned product to travel outside the district to purchase it.",49,,
312,0.97,2503.801,2508.906,They're more likely to pick up what's available at the first store they go to.,49,,
313,0.97,2508.906,2525.289,Also I noticed this is picking up steam with folks talking about in a number of Maryland counties at least are also considering gas powered leaf blower fans meaning it's harder for residents to purchase a device outside of the city.,49,,
314,0.97,2525.289,2531.061,"Of course, the laws will ban their use even where legally purchased elsewhere.",49,,
315,0.97,2531.061,2542.473,"Second, as we touched on earlier, our law extended to public actors meaning district agencies and contractors so by January of this year, all agencies fully shifting to electric leaf Blowers.",49,,
316,0.97,2542.473,2550.147,This was significant as we own and maintain a significant amount of green space.,49,,
317,0.97,2550.147,2553.217,"This costs $55,000 for the districts to accomplish.",49,,
318,0.97,2553.217,2557.688,I'll note that's not just for the leaf Blowers.,49,,
319,0.97,2557.688,2572.67,"This also includes it upgrades for the 311 system, vehicle costs for enforcement staff and some other what we call ""Nonpersonal"" so Nonsalary related costs so it would be significantly less than that and not a lot in general.",49,,
320,0.97,2572.67,2586.784,"Third, we also retain the ability of residents to report noise violations and strengthened the response by created a dedicated enforcement team in our agency which W two new staff.",49,,
321,0.97,2586.784,2592.256,Obviously still difficult to catch Violators in the act but this new staff really helped.,49,,
322,0.97,2592.256,2598.796,You may ask why the District framed this legislation around a noise disturbance issue rather than emissions.,49,,
323,0.97,2598.796,2608.439,Certainly reducing green House gas emissions is a critical goal of the district.,49,,
324,0.97,2608.439,2614.011,We just Codefi Shgsed carbon neutrality by 2025 and District government by 2040.,49,,
325,0.97,2614.011,2624.021,We established a green ban SHG building energy performance standards and acquired new building to be net Soer row starting in 2026.,49,,
326,0.97,2624.021,2632.496,The use of gasoline powered leaf Blowers has a meaningful effect on the climate.,49,,
327,0.97,2632.496,2640.571,It Emits 23 carbon Monoxide and Nonme that I know carbons as a pick up truck and they pollute the air.,49,,
328,0.97,2640.571,2647.378,Air quality is a big issue for the District where one in six residents suffer from asthma.,49,,
329,0.97,2647.378,2654.418,"These are disparities pronounced in areas of the district, home to persons of color so the environmental health benefits are key.",49,,
330,0.97,2654.418,2664.962,"With that said, we framed our bill around reducing noise disturbances Baz it's our understanding and close to the Federal agencies to get feedback on this.",49,,
331,0.97,2664.962,2681.045,It's our understanding that the Federal EPA has exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of product emissions and that banning these devices based on their emissions would put our law and likely any other jurisdictions at risk of legal challenge and being overturned.,49,,
332,0.97,2681.045,2687.651,I'm flagging this because we would strongly recommend Seattle to consider that fact when framing the resolution.,49,,
333,0.97,2687.651,2693.223,One final critical piece of the legislation adopted in the District was timing of implementation.,49,,
334,0.97,2693.223,2700.597,"As was noted earlier, the law was passed in 2018 but didn't go into effect until January 2022.",49,,
335,0.97,2700.597,2718.782,That sounds like four years it was actually two because nuances on how the District budgets the law isn't effective until it's funded and the law didn't go into effect until October 2019 so a little over two years and that delay provided wus several benefits.,49,,
336,0.97,2718.782,2743.34,A good amount of time to message about the new law to the public and our environmental and consumer affair agencies launched an education campaign and provided guidance on their Websites to residents and we offered up yard signs for free to residents gas is out and electric is in and had a link to learn more about it.,49,,
337,0.97,2743.34,2752.082,"Of course the delay provided a chance for Landscapers and other businesses, residents with time to transition to the electric devices.",49,,
338,0.97,2752.082,2762.426,"I would say though even at the time of passage and especially now, the cost to purchase electric leaf Blowers has fallen significantly.",49,,
339,0.97,2762.426,2773.036,"While the battery technology is improved, they're pretty much on par cost wise with the gas powered leaf Blowers and electric is typically cheaper than gas.",49,,
340,0.97,2773.036,2776.874,Depends on where you are and expensive how your electric is.,49,,
341,0.97,2776.874,2787.117,"Our approach is the change shouldn't price anyone out of a leaf blower and as one of the public witnesses noted, Rakes are always available and certainly much cheaper than either.",49,,
342,0.97,2787.117,2791.155,Still we wanted to give residents ample time to transition.,49,,
343,0.97,2791.155,2804.468,I would also note that the District through our sustainable energy utility offered a $50 rebate during that period for residents to purchase.,49,,
344,0.97,2804.468,2822.519,"Since it's been 8 months since the law went into effect, I don't have a lot of hard data on compliance to date or great data opt number of noise complaints we received but Anecdotely in talking to agencies, the transition seems to be going well in terms of businesses no longer offering products and compliance.",49,,
345,0.97,2822.519,2828.892,We do hear now and then of folks seeing a Landscaper using the devices.,49,,
346,0.97,2828.892,2837.434,Seattle is one of several jurisdictions considering laws like this and I think we're going to see even more in the coming years.,49,,
347,0.97,2837.434,2844.374,I thank you again for inviting me to speak and I'm also happy to talk to how we got the bill over the finish line and answer any questions.,49,,
348,0.97,2844.708,2849.88,Thank you very much.,49,,
349,0.97,2850.214,2855.485,.,49,,
350,0.97,2855.485,2863.36,I didn't know if you wanted to open it up for questions for Mr. Michael Porcello or Yolanda at this point.,50,,
351,0.97,2863.36,2874.204,"Yeah, I was going to that thank you, Mr. Michael Porcello and Councilmember Sara Nelson did I see your hand up?",51,,
352,0.97,2874.338,2881.712,I'll hold my questions for a second.,51,,
353,0.97,2881.712,2881.979,Go ahead.,51,,
354,0.97,2881.979,2882.212,Okay.,52,,
355,0.97,2882.212,2892.623,I don't see Councilmember Morse Morse okay go ahead.,52,,
356,0.97,2892.623,2898.262,You're on mute Councilmember Tammy J. Morales.,53,,
357,0.97,2898.262,2898.829,Sorry.,54,,
358,0.97,2898.829,2915.946,This is probably a question for Yolanda and I'm not sure you know the answer but I wonder if parks has contemplated mulching wet leaves at least the ones on the grass rather than trying to blow or rake them.,54,,
359,0.97,2915.946,2924.922,One of the Commenters mentioned alternatives to getting rid of the leaves at all.,54,,
360,0.97,2924.922,2928.292,I don't know if there's contemplated.,55,,
361,0.97,2928.292,2944.942,The resolution requests that parks and other departments consider other strategies so that's certainly another strategy of allowing the leaves to be able to more quickly decompose in place.,55,,
362,0.97,2944.942,2945.175,So Yeah.,55,,
363,0.97,2945.175,2945.542,Okay.,56,,
364,0.97,2945.542,2952.182,I just want to say first of all thank you Councilmember Alex Pedersen.,56,,
365,0.97,2952.182,2961.291,And Yolanda I appreciate the summary of past actions as the Council has been trying to do this for seven or 8 years now.,56,,
366,0.97,2961.291,2967.03,Move in this direction and I can also appreciate that the technology maybe wasn't there in the past.,56,,
367,0.97,2967.03,2970.667,But it seems like it is now.,56,,
368,0.97,2970.667,2990.053,"So I do think that it's important we support this transition and then if the green House gas impact isn't as large as transportation or buildings, there is still the health disparity to consider.",56,,
369,0.97,2990.053,3008.939,"Especially because whether Woer talking about small businesses or even our own city parks Department employees, it's predominantly black and Brown people using the equipment and we know there are health implications of using these tools so I do think it's important that we keep pushing.",56,,
370,0.97,3008.939,3012.542,And try to resolve this as quickly as possible.,56,,
371,0.97,3012.542,3035.165,And I will say I'm also a little bit concerned about the work that we'll be adding to Sdci without providing additional resources so I think it's important that we understand as Council what the impacts of our decisions will be on the city workers ability to implement.,56,,
372,0.97,3035.165,3049.513,"With that said, I think it's wise for us to move this direction and to just have the conversation and the budget process about what we might need to do to provide at least a little bit of support to Sdci to get this done.",56,,
373,0.97,3049.513,3060.624,So I'm supportive of the resolution even understanding that there's some concerns about it but I think we should move forward and keep the ball rolling so we can get this done sooner.,56,,
374,0.97,3060.957,3062.392,.,56,,
375,0.97,3062.392,3065.762,Thank you Councilmember Tammy J. Morales.,57,,
376,0.97,3065.762,3068.698,Councilmember Sara Nelson?,57,,
377,0.97,3068.698,3069.599,Thank you very much.,58,,
378,0.97,3069.599,3088.452,"So questions and comments basically I have to say that this sounds fairly noncontroversial and I haven't gotten any E-Mails from anybody saying no, we have to keep the gas powered leaf Blowers so thank you for forward and I will support this resolution.",58,,
379,0.97,3088.452,3089.519,A couple questions.,58,,
380,0.97,3089.519,3093.757,"First, I have sort of picking up on what Councilmember Tammy J.",58,,
381,0.97,3093.757,3095.392,Morales says about mulching.,58,,
382,0.97,3095.392,3132.729,"I do have to note that if I were to go out on a limb, leaving leaves on the ground could be an option according to a Uw Professor David Montgomery Leafing leaves on the ground not only contributes to soil health but the Microbes that Digest and further break down the matter Redistributes nitrogen, Fos Forrus and potassium around the soil and also to the plant roots making trees more healthy.",58,,
383,0.97,3132.729,3145.475,My question when I first heard of this was about how this will impact not just the workers on city property but also in the private sector.,58,,
384,0.97,3145.475,3166.663,So I did reach out to Marcos Juan president of the Seattle Metro Latino Chamber of Commerce to ask for his thoughts and I know that Councilmember Alex Pedersen also did as well and basically Mr. Juan is generally okay with this legislation.,58,,
385,0.97,3166.663,3179.075,"However, does believe like I do we have to think about unintended consequences in mitigating impacts so this question has to do with private property but also city costs.",58,,
386,0.97,3179.075,3191.721,"When we switch over from gas powered to electric power leaf Blowers, my question is do we know what that cost differential is?",58,,
387,0.97,3191.721,3206.736,And then I know this is for the next phase of legislation but has that work been done because parks is already thought about phasing out by 50% by 2026 so they must have something in costs.,58,,
388,0.97,3207.07,3215.712,.,58,,
389,0.97,3215.712,3226.423,"I agree, we will have that information ready in time for the budget deliberations this year at least.",59,,
390,0.97,3226.423,3244.741,"I think understanding maybe a Larnler picture verses just the unit costs, there may be other costs just as colleagues from DC mentioned that may be required for implementation but getting a sense of what that all will entail will be helpful.",59,,
391,0.97,3244.741,3254.985,I think another cost could be labor.,60,,
392,0.97,3254.985,3277.007,"The memo says electric leaf Blowers aren't strong enough yet to pick up leaves that cover drains so that will probably require human force to get those up and out of the right of way so that's one thing to consider but yes, still a good idea.",60,,
393,0.97,3277.007,3306.736,"And then for Mr. Michael Porcello, one of the things that I was wondering is did any of the stores that sell gas powered leaf Blowers in DC, what kind of--was there a big opposition that people would be going Ruth outside city limits to purchase these things and was that one of the unintended consequences that came to fruition?",60,,
394,0.97,3306.736,3323.72,"Sure, the only concern we really heard from businesses was giving them enough time to get existing stock off the shelves in the sense if they were selling leaf Blowers, they had gas powered to sell and for example, if the Prohibition was immediate, they weren't going to have a way to get rid of the stock.",61,,
395,0.97,3323.72,3325.789,That's part of the reason for the delay.,61,,
396,0.97,3325.789,3336.966,"Other Woiz, the understanding from them was somebody is coming in to buy a leaf blower, if it's electric or not they're going to purchase it on site.",61,,
397,0.97,3336.966,3368.865,"I'll also be touching on we're often more restrictive in terms of whether it's efficiency standards or products things like that our neighboring jurisdictions so businesses are used to--I don't think is frequent but the random customer who might be looking for a very inefficient for example water heater because it's cheaper, and knowing those folks will travel outside of the city so we didn't get a lot of negative feedback from them.",61,,
398,0.97,3368.865,3369.232,Just the delay.,61,,
399,0.97,3369.232,3369.499,Thank you.,62,,
400,0.97,3369.833,3380.777,"That's all the questions I have, thanks.",62,,
401,0.97,3380.777,3382.045,Thank you.,63,,
402,0.97,3382.045,3385.915,"Councilmember Sara Nelson, any comments from Councilmembers?",63,,
403,0.97,3385.915,3392.789,I support the resolution and I agree we should move it forward.,63,,
404,0.97,3392.789,3408.304,"Since I don't see any other questions, and since Councilmember Alex Pedersen who is the sponsor of this resolution is not a member of the committee, as chair of the committee I'm make the motions on his behalf but Alex Pedersen did you say any closing remarks before I do that?",63,,
405,0.97,3408.304,3433.163,"Just want to thank you again chair for making time today to hear this resolution and to provide ample time so we can hear from a jurisdiction that is ahead of us on this and has practice ACL advice on how it can be done, just like a hundred other jurisdictions across the nation have done this already.",64,,
406,0.97,3433.163,3440.637,So look forward to working with the Bruce Harrell administration to get this done.,64,,
407,0.97,3440.637,3453.65,Others have done it and we are Priding ourselves on being ahead on environmental and public health and worker protection issues so this is in alignment with that and should be done expeditiously.,64,,
408,0.97,3453.65,3467.13,"So following this resolution if it passes out of committee and goes to full Council and passes there, we'll look forward to working with the city departments to get it done because they have the power to do it.",64,,
409,0.97,3467.13,3471.0,Just going to take the will to do it and we can get it done.,64,,
410,0.97,3471.0,3471.201,Thank you.,64,,
411,0.97,3471.534,3478.174,Thank you Councilmember Alex Pedersen.,65,,
412,0.97,3478.174,3486.516,"So with those words, I move resolution 32064 forward.",65,,
413,0.97,3486.516,3486.783,Second.,66,,
414,0.97,3486.783,3487.417,Thank you.,67,,
415,0.97,3487.417,3499.562,"So as committee members know, there's a technical amendment one so I'll go ahead and move amendment one.",68,,
416,0.97,3499.696,3499.896,Second.,68,,
417,0.97,3499.896,3500.296,Thank you.,69,,
418,0.97,3500.296,3502.432,Is Yolanda are you going to speak?,69,,
419,0.97,3502.565,3504.834,I will speak to amendment one.,69,,
420,0.97,3504.834,3536.199,"It would correct a couple errors in the recitals and remove a recital that would be redundant as a result specifically that landscape professionals are Disportion Natalie Hispanic and U.S. labors of occupation and safety administration is responsible for rules related to sound thresholds, not the EPA as currently drafted.",69,,
421,0.97,3536.199,3543.373,Thank you Yolanda I don't imagine any questions or comments on that.,70,,
422,0.97,3543.373,3553.216,So can you call the roll on the amendment?,70,,
423,0.97,3553.216,3554.284,For amendment 1.,71,,

436,0.97,3577.907,3592.488,"Since we had space for comments earlier and Councilmember Alex Pedersen has given us closing remarks, I will go ahead and ask Ted to call the resolution on resolution 32064.",80,,
