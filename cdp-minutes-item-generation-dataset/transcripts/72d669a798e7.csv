59,0.97,355.221,363.629,"The question should not be whether Rittenhouse and any reason to believe his safety was in danger, but rather why was he there in the first place with an assault rifle.",16,,

61,0.97,365.431,369.302,Who Instigated this Vigilante Byron's?,16,,

71,0.97,441.007,451.918,"He has a close relationship with the Kenosha police Department, and a historically safeguarded Kenosha police from accountability for police brutality.",16,,
72,0.97,451.918,465.031,"Not only did they argue police were justified in shooting Jacob Blake seven times in the back, but following the execution of Michael ball in 2004, four Kenosha police officers, the District Attorney's office, refused to take the course.",16,,
73,0.97,465.031,471.504,"After allowing the police Department to change the story 19 times, the case was studied Out-Of-Court.",16,,

75,0.97,479.812,484.45,Instead we need to rapidly develop the authority of the left by building movements of workers and young people.,16,,

78,0.97,514.08,531.063,"And of course the justice for George Floyd movement, street protest movement itself has shown that a mass movement centered on the working-class, on the demands, can be capable of forcing reforms to the broken criminal justice system.",16,,
79,0.97,531.063,542.108,"However, we have to remember that racially just policing as a whole is impossible under a social system, like capitalism, which is based on Exportation and systemic racism.",16,,
80,0.97,542.108,550.917,"That is why ultimately I am a Socialist, because I believe that we need a new system based on human need and genuine justice for the oppressed.",16,,

145,0.97,941.907,957.423,The related CBA also is in the balancing package requested report from the city budget office to the Council on a potential citywide hiring incentive for frontline workers.,21,,
146,0.97,957.423,996.662,"And the resolution itself, the changes it makes to the Mayor's emergency order on hiring incentives limits the duration of the order through the end of 2021 and limits expenditures pursuant to the order to $500,000 which is the amount that the Mayor's office estimates would be needed in 2021 just as a bit of a background note, funding for $2 million for a citywide bonus program that would go into effect in 2022 did not pass at the budget committee.",21,,
147,0.97,996.662,1014.48,"It's of course a given that an incoming Mayor, that this emergency order under this resolution would end with the outgoing Mayor, the incoming Mayor could of course issue an executive order for 2022.",21,,
148,0.97,1014.48,1022.254,"But again, there is the question of the funding in the 2022 budget to support it.",21,,
149,0.97,1022.254,1026.692,"So, that's sort of the background on that.",21,,
