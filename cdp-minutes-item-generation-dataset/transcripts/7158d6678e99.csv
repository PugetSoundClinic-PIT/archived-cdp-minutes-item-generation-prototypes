41,0.97,615.348,637.67,"I am also a member of the National domestic workers alliance, and I have been very interested in what my participation in this industry can look like and how it can be beneficial for the work as a whole.",19,,
42,0.97,645.277,677.143,"I am very passionate about cleaning into people's homes, and I don't know how much you want to know, I guess I will just share why I am here, I think the work is actually really important and beautiful work, and has been historically undervalued because it is work that has been extracted for free or for very little money from women, particularly women of color.",20,,
43,0.97,677.143,716.882,"And as a result, I think the work itself has suffered very much in a race to the bottom in terms of how much work you can get people to do in a short amount of time, the use of toxic cleaning products and cheap equipment in order to save on costs, and increasingly use of gig labor that is almost entirely unregulated and without benefits for workers as a way of Minimizig both risk and overhead for employers that are increasingly looking more like marketing middlemen.",20,,

47,0.97,744.243,752.618,"I know it is possible, but also difficult at this moment in the history of the industry.",20,,
48,0.97,752.618,780.279,"So I am very honored to be here, and I look forward to contributing, both as someone who understands the challenges that employers face in terms of client expectations in this economy, and as someone who very much believes that it is well within our capacity to implement the ordinance and even go beyond that in terms of restoring the dignity of the",20,,

59,0.97,910.943,945.144,"We currently have a small group that is just focused on Galifuna, because it is a unrecognized ethnic group, we are focusing on what we do and are language, and that we also deserve rights.",26,,
60,0.97,952.117,965.064,And that is why it is really important for me to be at this table to learn more and to inform about the work of Garifuna.,26,,
61,0.97,965.064,979.578,"To be part of the workers rights, the people who work at homes.",26,,

69,0.97,1052.484,1081.68,"And I got involved in the ordinance through the fair Workcenter, I am part of a small organization called the Nanny collect live, we gather Nannies from around the area to go to her meetings and meet twice a month, and tell us things that they enjoy about the work, one of the things that fascinates me about the industry is it is so very.",29,,
70,0.97,1081.68,1106.872,"Varied, you have cleaners, Homecare workers, Nannies, etc., but everybody has a different experience, there is no standard, no norms, people who are new in industry or in a position where they can advocate for themselves do not know what's normal, or what to expect.",29,,
71,0.97,1106.872,1112.377,And what Excites me about the ordinance is the possibility of creating those norms.,29,,

75,0.97,1154.119,1161.326,I'm hoping to model behavior of people in power standing up for those groups.,29,,
76,0.97,1161.326,1193.792,"In addition to being a domestic worker, I have been a performers a performer and musician for number of years, I have many years of public speaking experience and confidence, I feel like I kind of live in both worlds, I do the work, so people who don't feel safe engaging in the spaces can tell me their stories, and feel comfortable, and I can bring those stories to the most relevant people who are helping these groups and make them the center of the conversation.",29,,

138,0.97,1904.302,1917.282,"That was an administrative oversight, I think the intent was that it would be part of the 2020 Watchlist from the Mayor's perspective but did make it into the proposal.",57,,
139,0.97,1917.282,1947.679,"That's right, we had opportunity to work with the executive, the Department of parks and recreation, and Councilmember Morris is also interested, Councilmember Morales, the executive has a joint interest in this, doesn't seem controversial at all, and we look forward to having it on the list, and appreciate Councilmember Juarez.",58,,
140,0.97,1947.679,1973.771,"Incredibly important, the Lake City community center serves a different population, it is often used as a reason not to build a community center, the current one was built by the lions Club, essentially a one room multipurpose use that is used by some a different community organizations, a new building is very important, glad to see this added.",59,,

142,0.97,1974.539,1987.685,"See no additional comments, I'm going to go ahead and see if we can move to amend it, the amended resolution include amendment number 1, any additional comments?",61,,

153,0.97,2046.11,2069.667,"For several reasons, one, the price tag is significant, $41 million, it has a potential for a scope Creek, it had a different name, it has been renamed to more accurately reflect efforts beyond simply MCI s replacement.",65,,
154,0.97,2069.667,2073.371,And the project is currently showing yellow on the status report.,65,,
155,0.97,2073.371,2081.045,Interbranch coordination as an additional level of complexity.,65,,
156,0.97,2081.045,2094.859,"And Lastly, criminal justice is a Council priority, looking forward to receiving more oversight on this particular project in my Committee, and I think putting it on the Watchlist helps facilitate that.",65,,
157,0.97,2094.859,2095.76,Anything to add?,66,,
158,0.97,2095.76,2103.801,That is a excellent Encapsulation of where we find ourselves on the project.,67,,
159,0.97,2103.801,2113.11,"I would note that this is a little bit different than some of the other projects, it is not a bricks and mortar kind of project.",67,,
160,0.97,2113.11,2121.285,It doesn't have quite the same phases of implementation.,67,,
161,0.97,2121.285,2146.077,"The main goal for the quarterly reports for the projects that are going to get these enhanced look ahead's is to identify potential risks on schedule, budget and scope, identify mitigation strategies that the executive plans on using, which may include asking the Council for more money, time or different scope I think that absolutely can be made to apply to a project like an I.T.",67,,
162,0.97,2146.077,2146.344,Project.,67,,
163,0.97,2146.344,2160.658,Do I recall correctly from the previous discussion that there may need to be sort of a different form created for projects like this that are not,68,,
164,0.97,2160.658,2183.381,"I think been noble and Kayla Wagner alluded to the possibility that they might Tweak the format, we will work with them to find something that addresses what I understand to be the main concerns of the Council.",69,,
165,0.97,2183.381,2184.248,Glad to hear that.,70,,
166,0.97,2184.248,2188.085,Any other questions?,70,,

172,0.97,2219.817,2232.096,"Is, I spoke last time, about the development, the Smith Cove park development, and a photograph with the Mayor, Councilmember Phillips, the port Commissioner and many others from the community as the park was opened.",74,,
173,0.97,2232.096,2253.918,"Although it is so many years later in the park has not begun development, and phase I and phase II, some schedule slips due to the King County waste water treatment facility pipes, it is very important that we get the part done, and completed, and I think it should remain on the Watchlist.",74,,
174,0.97,2253.918,2254.518,I definitely agree.,75,,
175,0.97,2254.518,2255.62,Any additional comments?,75,,
176,0.97,2255.62,2276.474,"Only to note that like the first project, Lake City committee center, that was on the 2019 Watchlist, and I believe it was an administrative oversight that it wasn't included as part of the proposed 2020 project list.",76,,

183,0.97,2298.529,2320.117,"One of the issues that I have played around with is what are the expectations, our expectations of ourselves, really, when we have identified projects on a Watchlist.",78,,
184,0.97,2320.117,2349.747,"The intent of the original resolution was for the Finance Committee to be the committee to hear the reports overall, but I think a number of us talked about the hope that the committees with oversight of the different CIP projects would sort of take on the responsibility for really focusing on the projects that fall into the portfolio of their committee.",78,,
185,0.97,2349.747,2399.964,"We don't collectively control what our colleagues put on their budget, so I don't know if there is a way to facilitate that happening, but I guess my hope is for central staff to be assertive with Councilmembers about their recommendations for projects on the Watchlist, including if you have recommendations, additional oversight, we have in some cases used a staging process for budgeting, and they place Provisos on projects at different stages.",78,,
186,0.97,2399.964,2434.298,"Again, central staff, I know you're looking at the big picture, not all the individual departments, different central staffers assigned to those different departments, if you could convey the message and the hope that we really rely on central staff to make recommendations, absent a process for making a determination on which projects would be appropriate projects for even additional oversight measures like Provisos.",78,,
187,0.97,2434.298,2438.636,"Noted, thank you.",79,,
188,0.97,2438.636,2457.454,"And maybe we can do Brainstorming afterwards about a message that could come from the committee to our Council colleagues, about the final list, I know they will be aware and it will come before the full Council on Monday, if it is voted on today.",80,,
189,0.97,2457.454,2472.269,"I would like to see if there's a way to formalize it even further, given your interest in having a robust process, maybe identifying ways to ensure communication is clear and transparent, as we get word that maybe they are not on time.",80,,
190,0.97,2472.269,2505.569,"One of the ways we try to do that at the staff level, when we received the quarterly enhanced reports, we distribute them to all nine Councilmembers, and try to provide an executive summary highlighting the one or two projects out of the list cut each quarter generally having some news where there is something that we think is worth paying attention to and may need some follow-up.",81,,
191,0.97,2505.569,2514.345,"Of course every project has tidbits and interesting bits of information, but we try to highlight what we think people will be most interested in.",81,,
192,0.97,2514.345,2530.961,"Another opportunity, again, members to determine what is on the work plan, but if you are making recommendations to include the corresponding projects to those individual committees, it carries great weight . your influence.",82,,
193,0.97,2530.961,2536.233,Thank you.,83,,
194,0.97,2536.233,2546.143,"Thinking of items being in the news, one of the things I was interested in adding was tracking any additional funding or changes that could be coming down the Pike related to 35th street.",84,,
195,0.97,2546.143,2593.39,"And subsequent conversations, made it seem like it wasn't the most appropriate forum, one of the things that will be of interest to me is to see how much of an under spend we have, given that the protected bike lanes did not go into place, and if there are opportunities for us to Revisit that strategy that is being deployed there, that is something that I would be interested in tracking, this CIP Watchlist is potentially not the best place, I'm a strong believer we should have included the protected bike lanes on the road, I'm concerned about the number of injuries and deaths occurring there, and people feeling unsafe and experiencing unsafe situations.",84,,
196,0.97,2593.39,2605.769,"Look forward to working with you all, and through the transportation Committee, ways to further implement a protected bike Lane.",84,,

213,0.97,2785.849,2800.297,"So the item and how you can contact me, because my work is around how work is organized and structured, about that issue.",90,,
214,0.97,2800.297,2814.311,"When we think about work and how work is structured, we really begin with, if I can make this work, there we go.",90,,
215,0.97,2814.311,2817.381,Sort of a North Star of what work should be for workers.,90,,
216,0.97,2817.381,2826.123,It should give us stability and safety and an opportunity to contribute and connect with each other.,90,,
217,0.97,2826.123,2837.301,"And make sure we can join together and ensure that our workplaces get better and better, and our families thrive in communities thrive.",90,,
218,0.97,2837.301,2839.536,We kind of think about it as our North Star.,90,,
219,0.97,2839.536,2857.621,"And one of the problems is this really Decades-Old practice by many companies of not complying with labor laws, by reason of calling workers independent contractors.",90,,
220,0.97,2857.621,2865.128,That is not their employees but an entirely separate business.,90,,
221,0.97,2865.128,2872.636,"In the last several years, the focus has really been on Apple- based work.",90,,
222,0.97,2872.636,2886.583,"So you all have seen and heard and addressed issues around the transportation network companies, and others, but I guess I want to say a couple of things about that.",90,,
223,0.97,2886.583,2897.494,"We really like to say that there is not a gig economy, it is just the economy.",90,,
224,0.97,2897.494,2916.113,"Because Apple-Based work is really the tip of the iceberg, and in all of these other sectors that you see below the surface, that aren't getting as much attention, we see the treatment of workers as running Teir own business.",90,,
225,0.97,2916.113,2926.823,"At-Based work, it's hard to get statistics, it is about 3% right now in Washington state of all work, about 57,000 workers.",90,,

227,0.97,2936.6,2953.65,One reason that this gets so much attention is that these companies have been very clear that they don't believe that they are required to comply with labor standards.,90,,
228,0.97,2953.65,2974.171,"Another reason we are concerned about it is that it isn't just domestic work or delivery or transportation, although those are the biggest sectors, but really starting to creep into other sectors, including retail and hospitality and nursing and teaching and law.",91,,
229,0.97,2974.171,2996.059,"So that technology, the dispatch workers, technology is fine, the problem is that this business model, not being responsible for workers, is gaining more attraction.",91,,

243,0.97,3178.074,3183.446,While maintaining control over workers in the work that they do.,95,,
244,0.97,3183.446,3203.066,"And just a little bit of context I guess, you may have seen us to the survey and analysis, they found that over half of the workers were earning minimum wage, the average pay was $7.66 per hour.",95,,
245,0.97,3203.066,3241.137,"And recently, a researcher in New York today study that really differentiated between high wage independent contractors and low-wage workers, and for people who are maids and Housekeepers, Childcare workers, annual earnings, in a five-year period fell, for independent contractors, while at rose for 25% for those who are employees, it has a real impact, treated as an independent contractor.",95,,
246,0.97,3241.137,3274.938,"The other point is and the same study of the independent contractors New York are people of color, in New York are people of color, there certainly was a study in connection with the domestic workers bill of rights, finding the overwhelming numbers of domestic workers are women of color.",96,,
247,0.97,3274.938,3288.885,"I want to talk a little bit about the policy impacts, or policies that States and cities have undertaken.",97,,
248,0.97,3288.885,3305.969,"The first is this issue of defining who is an employee and who is not, and you probably followed a little bit that California just passed a law with very expansive definitions for all sectors of who is an employee.",97,,
249,0.97,3305.969,3317.514,"And I guess a couple of things about California, it has gotten a lot of attention, California is not the only state to use that test.",97,,
250,0.97,3317.514,3327.29,"About half of the States use some version of it in their unemployment insurance laws, and about eight or 10 use it for certain sectors, three other states use it across the board.",97,,
251,0.97,3327.29,3334.831,"You would think from what you have read, that California is a state, but that's not the case.",97,,
252,0.97,3334.831,3345.942,"It is having an effect, a recent news article about the accountant and construction workers, that are now Reclassifying the workers in California.",97,,
253,0.97,3345.942,3356.353,"And Catalyzed more campaigns in New Jersey, to expand their law, New York, and announcing the campaign.",97,,
254,0.97,3356.353,3383.847,"There are other models around who is included and who is excluded, and one really groundbreaking one was the Seattle domestic worker bill of rights, that essentially said we don't care whether you want to label your workers on the side of the liner that set of aligned, employees or independent contractors, they are entitled to these rights.",97,,
255,0.97,3383.847,3389.652,The first city to do that.,97,,
256,0.97,3389.652,3409.572,"The parallel minimum wage for workers who are not considered employees, and you are familiar with the pay standard, legislation here in Seattle that follows New York, establishing a minimum pay for transportation network drivers.",97,,
257,0.97,3409.572,3424.921,The second piece is really experimentation with ways in which workers voices can be irrigated to negotiate with the business.,98,,
258,0.97,3424.921,3450.046,"And you had just heard about an hour ago about with domestic workers, some are thinking as bargaining at the state level, and certainly at the Federal level, and how you would build a collective bargaining regime on top of minimum labor standards.",98,,
259,0.97,3450.046,3450.947,Strachan finally is enforcement.,98,,
260,0.97,3450.947,3458.955,"You all know, because you have such a great labor standards enforcement, strategic enforcement is important.",98,,
261,0.97,3458.955,3469.065,"One thing that some States have done is making the classification a violation itself, if I Miss classify it, I can bring an action.",98,,

263,0.97,3474.971,3483.079,"You may well get access to social security as well, that we cannot change at the city level.",98,,
264,0.97,3483.079,3489.586,"Enforcement really matters, and public enforcement really matters.",98,,
265,0.97,3489.586,3513.309,"Here are some examples of enforcement by public agencies, most of them are focused on the gig economy, but there have been a fair number of public enforcement actions, in construction, and Carwash, in other industries that frequently treat workers as independent contractors as well.",99,,
266,0.97,3513.309,3527.323,And we found there have been a couple of studies recently that have shown a lessening of independent contractors and an industry when there is good enforcement.,99,,
267,0.97,3527.323,3532.228,So that is another huge issue and an issue that Rachel talk about.,99,,

269,0.97,3545.975,3565.862,"Colleagues, one of the things that I know Rebecca Smith and I faced when we were working on legislation at state level, was this fear that if we did a better job at really protecting those who are being misclassified, that somehow there would no longer be a category of independent workers.",100,,
270,0.97,3565.862,3577.974,"And I want to Debunk that, offering a few examples, I know you are accredited, the question is do people have direction and control over their work.",100,,
271,0.97,3577.974,3590.353,"And you can think of industries where people are BONA fide independent contractors, the plumber who SETS his or her own schedule, may have the clients they know, their tools, they direct and control their own work.",100,,
272,0.97,3590.353,3613.209,"Think of some realtors, they set their own schedule, reach out for the clients, and Becky, if you want to comment on that, to Debunk the myth that if you address Misclassification, you are eliminating the ability to be independent contractors?",100,,
273,0.97,3613.209,3633.229,"Right, it is a question of whether you have the ability to set your own prices and have your own customer base, and whether you can control expenses and thereby make a profit or a loss.",101,,
274,0.97,3633.229,3648.044,"A few months ago there was a lunch and learn session that I spoke at, and there was a worker who was a driver, and he talked about how his windshield had been broken three times in a really short period of time, he can't recoup that.",101,,

296,0.97,3850.346,3865.761,"And Secondly, I don't know if there will be a recommendation regarding legal, political and policy strategy, the most challenging thing for me on this issue is this question of which way do you go.",108,,
297,0.97,3865.761,3898.694,"Do you go the Definitional route, and define more accurately to today's circumstance what a worker is, and you make sure that all those workers have the same access to benefit, or a sector by sector approach, or say, as you said earlier, it doesn't matter how you classify your worker, even if you classify them as a contract worker, they get these benefits.",108,,

306,0.97,3982.178,3984.18,Something to think about while we think about the why.,112,,

313,0.97,4060.289,4060.556,Yes.,115,,
314,0.97,4060.556,4067.863,We have printed copies as well.,116,,
315,0.97,4067.863,4072.334,"And Rebecca, if you want to Chime in, just note that you are muted on our end over here.",116,,
316,0.97,4072.334,4076.639,It appears.,116,,
317,0.97,4076.639,4078.34,"Great, there comes the presentation.",116,,
318,0.97,4078.34,4098.961,"Okay, I will start about the forced arbitration crisis, you may be aware, forced arbitration refers to causes that are included in employment contracts, they sometimes appear in job applications, or employee manuals.",117,,
319,0.97,4098.961,4127.423,"Sometimes workers don't even find anything, it is sort of implicit upon accepting a job or the employment Handbook, they are waiving their right to sue in the event of a violation of their employment rights, their only option is an arbitration system that has been designed by corporations to make it difficult for workers to win.",117,,
320,0.97,4127.423,4141.136,"What happened recently is in 2018, the Supreme Court decided the case that essentially said that not only can employees be forced into arbitration, but they can be forced to waive their right to proceed collectively.",117,,
321,0.97,4141.136,4153.415,One of the most powerful tools of enforcement of workplace standards for many years has been the class action lawsuit.,117,,
322,0.97,4153.415,4175.137,"And just to provide perspective and analysis, at the policy Institute, they found that the top 10 class-action lawsuits in 2015-16 covered almost 4 times as much for workers as all of the state and Federal employment agencies combined.",117,,
323,0.97,4175.137,4191.186,"So the power of the class action lawsuit to help workers, and to establish a environment in which employers invest in compliance, is really significant.",117,,
324,0.97,4191.186,4229.792,"So the last few years, as of 2017, an estimate that more than half of Nonunion private sector workers had lost the right to sue, two thirds of Low- wage workers, and we project because they were collected before the Supreme Court case, which then spawned a whole reaction from corporations and their attorneys, that we project based on the past rate of expansion of worker arbitration following previous decisions, that within the next few years, more than 80% of workers will have lost their rights.",117,,
325,0.97,4229.792,4250.312,"And it's important to recognize about forced arbitration, is portrayed as a more affordable or cost-effective mechanism for people to resolve their rights, it is really designed for one thing, and that is to suppress claims.",117,,
326,0.97,4250.312,4274.87,"What happens is, working people can't bring claims that arbitration, both because the system is inherently Biased, because corporations, the repeat players, Arbitrators are for hire, and they know if they repeatedly find for the worker or the consumer, the corporation is not going to select them again as an Arbitrator.",117,,
327,0.97,4274.87,4279.541,There are a whole number of different ways in which she can be rigged to make it very hard for workers to win.,117,,
328,0.97,4279.541,4282.144,"And when they do win, they recover far less.",117,,
329,0.97,4282.144,4294.189,"In some cases, some of the kinds of remedies that a court could provide is not available to an Arbitrator, even if they wanted to.",117,,
330,0.97,4294.189,4310.205,"For example, if an individual worker comes forward and in the course of their case reveals Endemic gender discrimination, the Arbitrator might be able to award them some back wages, but not have the power to order the company to change its practices moving forward.",118,,
331,0.97,4310.205,4339.201,"As a result of this, 90% of the claims as announced, are expected to be in court, just vanish when arbitration is the only option, one of the best examples very recently, Doordash, you might've seen the recent case, it was in an arbitration clause saying you can't bring the claims collectively, each of you go through individual arbitration to challenge, what is a systemic employment practice.",118,,
332,0.97,4339.201,4344.94,And classification of all of these Doordash workers.,118,,
333,0.97,4344.94,4350.846,Typically that is word ends.,118,,
334,0.97,4350.846,4361.623,"They can't afford to bring individual arbitration, but in this case the workers actually tried to seek individual arbitration and Doordash refused.",118,,
335,0.97,4361.623,4368.664,"Because they are not interested in using it as an alternative way to address the claims, just interested in hiding their noncompliance.",118,,
336,0.97,4368.664,4370.165,Rachel.,119,,
337,0.97,4370.165,4372.401,Can you hear me?,119,,
338,0.97,4372.401,4372.968,Yes.,120,,
339,0.97,4372.968,4376.572,This is Lisa.,121,,
340,0.97,4376.572,4380.242,A? question.,121,,
341,0.97,4380.242,4382.177,Quick question.,121,,
342,0.97,4382.177,4428.824,"I appreciate your focus on why forced arbitration can be harmful not just to individual workers and classes of workers, but the incentive to invest on compliance, but it could be said that forced arbitration and eliminating the ability for class-action suits also has an impact on future potential policy, because sometimes lawmakers set policy based on these prior cases that can become very high-profile cases that demand the attention of legislators.",121,,
343,0.97,4428.824,4466.128,"Yes, that's right, often times, the cases that come forward reveal some of the intractable problems in employment, and to address policy, and also we need them to clarify what the law is, courts play the role of filling in the blanks of legislative Enactments, so if you don't have an opportunity to bring those questions before you judge and create a public record, you're not providing that.",122,,
344,0.97,4466.128,4479.842,"I would say there are a lot of good employers out there, who invest in compliance because they believe in following the law, and they will experience a competitive disadvantage from the employers out there who think I'm going to get away with this.",123,,
345,0.97,4479.842,4505.2,"And I don't know for every corporation is necessarily a malevolent calculation of I will start stealing people's wages now because I can, but the incentive that a company has to invest in compliance versus cutting corners or not paying very much attention to compliance, are dramatically shifting in this moment.",123,,
346,0.97,4505.2,4514.71,And it is a really significant threat to all of the really innovative workplace standards that have been created in Seattle.,123,,
347,0.97,4514.71,4533.228,"I will just say, we have in Seattle really one of the best labor standards agencies, but it is not really equipped to fill the void that is left by the disappearance overnight of class-action lawsuits.",124,,
348,0.97,4533.228,4548.043,"I will mention briefly with the policy solution is that folks should be aware of, and talk a little bit about some of the things that are happening currently.",125,,
349,0.97,4548.043,4566.561,"There is a bill moving currently, in the act that essentially Deputize his workers to bring to court, the idea is, the workers can't do a class action lawsuit.",125,,
350,0.97,4566.561,4577.072,"For back wages or be made whole, the state still has the authority to enforce the law, and the weight does that is by enforcing penalties.",125,,
351,0.97,4577.072,4588.684,"There has been able policy in place in California, it essentially Deputize is working people, they can bring for their complaints.",125,,
352,0.97,4588.684,4608.003,"First if the agency doesn't act because of lack of resources to take on every single case, the worker can file a representative action in court on behalf of the agency, and all inspected employees.",125,,
353,0.97,4608.003,4619.381,"And the class session is a collective way for workers to enforce their rights, this provides a similar type collective.",125,,
354,0.97,4619.381,4641.737,"So the state of California last year received $88 million because most of the money recovered in these kind of lawsuits actually goes back to the labor standards agency to build out there public enforcement capacity, and a amount goes to the workers.",125,,
355,0.97,4641.737,4661.556,"That we have been very inspired by Seattle's model of community enforcement, and the bills moving in many States trying to address this, I encourage some of the revenue that is generated through this process to be earmarked for community outreach and projects.",125,,
356,0.97,4661.556,4687.783,"I will briefly note that this basic model, with enforcement, has been in place for millennia, it was used in the Roman Empire, not a new model, it has been used in the U.S., the primary way, that the Federal Government and state governments recover under the false claims act.",126,,
357,0.97,4687.783,4690.485,And very successful in California.,126,,
358,0.97,4690.485,4711.406,"One of the key things is that courts have ruled even if you're covered by forced arbitration clause, you can still participate in the Whistleblower framework, because the real owner of the lawsuit is the state, and the workers are serving as an agent of the state.",126,,
359,0.97,4711.406,4716.411,The state has not signed a forced arbitration clause or waived any rights to pursue it.,126,,
360,0.97,4716.411,4751.546,"I want to talk a little bit about what's happening in Seattle, and specifically what the risk is for a relatively new law, the secure scheduling ordinance, with the rise of forced arbitration, it applies to workers in food service and retail who work for large employers, over 500 employees, these are the companies that are most likely to have already forced their workers into arbitration clauses.",127,,
361,0.97,4751.546,4772.167,"And you know, as far as I know, there hasn't been a single private lawsuit brought to enforce future scheduling, likely because few of the covered workers have the ability to bring those kinds of lawsuits anymore.",127,,
362,0.97,4772.167,4778.14,And I think with the office of labor standards is done that has been exceptional.,127,,
363,0.97,4778.14,4781.276,Significantly.,127,,
364,0.97,4781.276,4792.053,"For employers and technical assistance to employers, unparalleled, and what I have seen.",127,,
365,0.97,4792.053,4828.823,"And its result a lot of complaints and I will say that one of the most important pieces allowing folks that are part time so that you can them hire more people, thinking about the advanced notice component, many that I've spoken to, the underemployment in the industry is as important if not more so.",127,,
366,0.97,4828.823,4834.729,It is a question of being able to pay your bills.,127,,
367,0.97,4834.729,4847.309,"When people see that the employers are hiring and training people, and they are stuck at Fort at 25 or 15 hours a week, for people struggling economically.",127,,
368,0.97,4847.309,4878.773,"A third of workers covered under the ordinance are struggling with being so when we saw the valuation of secure scheduling, one of the things that jumped out to me is that there are a number of employers that are completely in compliance, I attribute that in part two technical assistance and support that we've provided, to make sure that employers who want to follow the law know how to do it.",127,,
369,0.97,4878.773,4883.078,We saw employers systematic the violating the law.,127,,
370,0.97,4883.078,4901.496,"Managers who reported that I can't comply, because there is a corporate policy that limits me to only 25 hours per week, I can only make two people full time and then after that everybody has to be part-time.",127,,
371,0.97,4901.496,4922.083,"This is the kind of thing where we would benefit a lot from being able to have a high- profile case that gets a lot of attention, that has substantial consequences for employers that are not making a little mistake here or there, but have maintained a business practice that is completely at odds with the policy of the city.",127,,
372,0.97,4922.083,4927.122,And doing it without any real consequence.,127,,
373,0.97,4927.122,4944.939,"So that is the thing, the inability to have a really Hard- hitting enforcement that sends a message to the whole industry, like Wow, this could be a risk for me if I don't get",127,,
374,0.97,4944.939,4974.269,"I will talk about one other policy area, but I will pause, one thing that I did not put in the slide, I have a lot of sympathy that the agency is in, although Resourced comparatively well, has to make decisions about how they invest in this project of creating a culture of compliance.",128,,
375,0.97,4974.269,4991.653,I think that most agencies do not Prioritize these kinds of High-Stakes enforcement actions that are capable of sending a strong Reverberating public message to the entire regulated community.,128,,
376,0.97,4991.653,4998.593,And it's expensive and hard to do.,128,,
377,0.97,4998.593,5037.232,"And looking at all of these other workers who filed complaints, those cases have to wait, the high yield case, that's where I think the private bar has traditionally been helpful in going after the big cases, and there are some places that are trying to experiment with contingency arrangements, where agencies will partner with respect to private lawyers, work up this case and bring it, and we will collect the penalties.",128,,
378,0.97,5037.232,5040.435,Similar to the Whistleblower model but on an informal basis.,128,,
379,0.97,5040.435,5054.249,I just wanted to share some of those reflections on how the worker arbitration crisis might be Impacting shift towards compliance.,128,,
380,0.97,5054.249,5092.387,"And a new policy process popping up, which is around the employment world, in theory, and the employer can fire anybody at any time, like retaliation, or discrimination, it ends up being a very imbalanced power dynamic, where the fear of being fired, shaves everything about a workers experience.",129,,
381,0.97,5092.387,5106.067,"Low-wage, high turnover industries, where employers are not investing, they don't see the workforce as folks to be invested into a part of their profit model.",129,,
382,0.97,5106.067,5109.704,They see labor as a cost to be controlled.,129,,
383,0.97,5109.704,5136.331,"We see all the time that people are fired for any reason, nor reason, not given an explanation, and the fear that workers face of the time, knowing they can be fired in a moment, is a major deterrent we think about building the trust that workers have to be able to come forward and enforce their rights.",129,,
384,0.97,5136.331,5138.733,Largely a complaint driven agency.,129,,
385,0.97,5138.733,5144.639,Prioritizing the complaints that are brought to them.,129,,
386,0.97,5144.639,5153.615,And we can't expect workers to be brave and risk retaliation when they can be fired for any reason.,129,,
387,0.97,5153.615,5163.758,"It is really hard to prove retaliation, prove that somebody has been discriminated against.",129,,
388,0.97,5163.758,5180.842,"The idea of just cause, what is the burden, instead of workers having to prove they were fired for the wrong reason, let's ask employers to show they are firing somebody for a legitimate performance problem or in the case of layoffs, or reductions in hours for a legitimate business reason.",129,,
389,0.97,5180.842,5196.925,"One of the things to note, of how employment is, there are so many arbitrary reasons for firing people that really are, if not by law discrimination, they are certainly racially coded.",130,,
390,0.97,5196.925,5216.511,"People are told you are not filing enough, or your hair, your nails, standards normalized around job performance often carry a lot of racial prejudice.",130,,

394,0.97,5284.846,5295.923,"A lot of excitement about it, it goes to the heart of control, that employers have over workers, and the abuse of that control.",131,,
395,0.97,5295.923,5298.459,In those sectors.,131,,
396,0.97,5298.459,5322.116,We have a few Questions. & GT; & GT; I want to say I think the policy basis for just cause are well enshrined in the city council as it relates specifically to Jus cause in the housing arena.,132,,
397,0.97,5322.116,5359.354,"We have is a matter of policy a long history dating back to the 80s, of prohibiting no cause Evictions, for two reasons, both we don't want arbitrary Evictions, just like we would not want arbitrary Terminations, but also as you mentioned, we know that in standing up for one's rights in the housing arena, the fear of an arbitrary Eviction ways very high in the minds of tenants.",132,,
398,0.97,5359.354,5368.896,So I think this Council would really understand the policy basis for something like this in the employment arena because of the long history with just cause in Evictions.,132,,

400,0.97,5374.102,5414.208,"As a person who went to law school at Berkeley, one of my first experiences as a law student in practicing and giving advice to clients under the supervision of practicing lawyers was at the East Bay workers rights clinic in the Bay area, run by Mike Gately, I wanted to ask the question, from my recollection of that, it was a while ago now, I seem to recall that there was some kind of ordinance or law in San Francisco County related to having a just cause for termination.",134,,
401,0.97,5414.208,5423.584,"I remember that we used to get excited in the clinic when something was there who had been terminated in San Francisco, because we had more tools to provide relief.",134,,
402,0.97,5423.584,5438.533,"If I'm remembering that correctly, and if you could maybe talk about what that ordinance entails, and what lessons there might be in the approach that San Francisco was",134,,
403,0.97,5438.533,5473.534,"I have to look into that, I'm not aware of any ordinance, it's possible, I know that there are some statutes that may have originated in San Francisco, and also some in Seattle if I'm not mistaken, creating a presumption of retaliation if the termination takes place within let's say 90 days of of some kind of protected activity.",135,,
404,0.97,5473.534,5498.292,"That was sort of intended to make it easier for a worker to carry their case, showing look, I spoke up at this point, a month later I was fired, this is not a coincidence, it shifts the burden to the employer having to show some of the reasons for the termination.",135,,
405,0.97,5498.292,5504.599,But I will have to look and make sure I have not missed some kind of landmark law in San Francisco that we should be looking to.,135,,
406,0.97,5504.599,5505.132,Thank you.,136,,
407,0.97,5505.132,5514.809,"I'm going to look into it as well on my end, I did not think about it during the presentation, it rekindled the memory.",137,,
408,0.97,5514.809,5529.357,"I am curious to follow up on that, I remember there being something, I don't know the extent to which it applies, to the extent it could be instructive, looking at what other cities are doing is an important part of the process.",137,,

416,0.97,5590.284,5609.403,"There is a need to assess how many employees were impacted because typically penalties are on a per worker basis, a bigger company will pay more in penalties because you have more employees.",142,,
417,0.97,5609.403,5669.563,"The ideas that one worker could Úcome forward and identify noncompliance, prove the case, prove that it has impacted The., and we often see that there are folks who are afraid of retaliation, particularly with these super aggressive activities, having a person who is a citizen come forward on behalf of all of their coworkers, who might be Undocumented or have a documented family members, and the best way to do this is to allow workers to identify a trusted organization, a Union, or a legal clinic of some sort to bring forward the claim, and in that case the agency would be aware of the identity of the person who is coming forward, they would be protected as far as that.",142,,
418,0.97,5669.563,5684.345,"In the type of worker we would want to try to identify would be a Nonreprsentative worker who has the class collective waiver in their contract, is that correct?",143,,
419,0.97,5684.345,5715.476,"Anyone can come forward, they don't need to have a waiver, what we are seeing in California is that they have one of the highest rates of class-action waivers and enforced arbitration in the country, and workers have been relying on this mechanism is an alternative way to get into court to provide accountability for their employers, but not restricted to those folks, anyone can bring it.",144,,
420,0.97,5715.476,5741.435,"I didn't mean to suggest it is restricted, but given the context of that the strategy was presented to us, and that it was identified as an enforcement strategy that folks who had waivers could use, I'm just supposing that would be a good way to go for those kinds of workers?",145,,
