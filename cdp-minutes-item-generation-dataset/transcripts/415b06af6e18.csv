90,0.97,566.832,577.543,Roughly 20 years ago a Councilmember fought an ordinance in city parks that essentially Criminalized poverty and unfairly targeted lack and Brown people disproportionately.,16,,
91,0.97,577.543,583.449,The law allowed officials to ban anyone from parks for nuisance violation.,16,,
92,0.97,583.449,592.058,"Councilmember Herbold was quoted as saying, this has had a devastating impact on people of little means.",16,,
93,0.97,592.058,612.044,"In 2022 Mayor Harrell wants to create an arm of Seattle please call, parks rangers, and 2022, when the wealth gap is growing and homelessness abounded, I support true public safety for all.",16,,
94,0.97,612.044,633.699,"New parks levy dollars to be invested in transforming our community centers into climate resilience hubs, adding Full- time staff in these hubs would do more to protect vulnerable community members and expanding policing infrastructure that only exacerbates harm.",16,,
95,0.97,633.699,645.578,"Councilmembers, your upcoming vote on the message about who we are as a city, a urge you to vote in line with all of us.",16,,

100,0.97,678.01,684.15,I want to thank you all so much for passing last year's resolution to Decriminalize Psychedelics in Seattle.,18,,
101,0.97,684.15,717.817,"Doing that really showed us that you are listening and that you see the potential for Psychedelic plant medicine to help so many members of the community who are affected by mental health conditions, like depression, Ptsd, and substance abuse disorder although the resolution is a huge step in the right direction we would like to see Decriminalization codified into an ordinance to further establish city council stance and provide more legal protection for community members of Seattle.",18,,
102,0.97,717.817,725.624,Last year the Council mentioned that passing an ordinance would be the next step.,18,,
103,0.97,725.624,731.13,"Some wondering, with my remaining time, is it possible to receive an update on the progress and the ordinance from the Council?",18,,
104,0.97,731.13,737.937,"Elise, feel free to contact my office, as well as Councilmember Lewis as cosponsors of the earlier action.",19,,

117,0.97,769.502,779.912,It was refreshing to see the Seattle city council take such a step in making us the largest city at the time to do this.,22,,
118,0.97,779.912,781.78,Oh like a simple step to codify this.,22,,
119,0.97,781.78,789.388,This would give the city protections in natural Psychedelic medicine more strength as a result of your actions.,22,,
120,0.97,789.388,792.892,"Dozens of people have found relief from depression, addiction, Ptsd, amongst others with natural Psychedelics.",22,,
121,0.97,792.892,797.963,"Passing an ordinance would reaffirm support for Psychedelics, both in Washington State and across the country.",22,,

127,0.97,832.998,841.106,"These new parks cops would further criminalize people experiencing homelessness and poverty, lead to increased trauma and arrest, and cause permanent poor conditions.",24,,
128,0.97,841.106,860.059,Pleased and--there is real danger these positions will be used to create a permanent crew devoted to displacing our house was neighbors and discarding their belongings.,24,,
129,0.97,860.059,870.703,As the city Re-Calibrates the roll of the police Department it is vital that we do not inadvertently create another version of the police specifically focused on targeting poor and park users.,24,,
130,0.97,870.703,872.705,Our next Speaker is Peter Condit.,25,,
131,0.97,872.705,877.509,Followed by Roxanne.,25,,

133,0.97,878.277,893.692,This is Peter Condit in district 6. I'm calling as a survivor of police assault that you use the park levy dollars to make our public spaces more accessible and less threatening to all park users.,26,,
134,0.97,893.692,903.969,I urge you to vote no on any version of the levy that includes the expansion of park rangers.,26,,
135,0.97,903.969,915.047,As currently proposed these new rangers would function as cops with the authority to further criminalize people experiencing homelessness and poverty.,26,,
136,0.97,915.047,917.316,"Funding that would increase trauma, arrests, harm, and violence in our city.",26,,
137,0.97,917.316,922.021,"In addition, I urge you to look closely at the proposal to create permanent positions to clean areas around Encampments and parks.",26,,
138,0.97,922.021,927.726,There's a real danger these positions will be Reused to create a permanent crew that displays our house was neighbors and discard their belongings.,26,,
139,0.97,927.726,949.081,"As our city focuses on strengthening the Footprint of the Seattle police Department and the Aunt accountable violence they bring, including myself in 2020, 2021, and 2022, it is vital that we do not inadvertently create another version of the police in other departments.",26,,
140,0.97,949.081,962.194,If you believe black lives matter do not authorize $3.6 million for park rangers who would specifically target--users.,26,,
141,0.97,962.194,966.098,This means stopping the expansion of policing in our parks.,26,,
142,0.97,966.098,967.7,Do not fund more cops.,26,,

148,0.97,1004.803,1005.838,It is cops by another name.,28,,
149,0.97,1005.838,1008.107,I do not think this will make our parks any safer.,28,,
150,0.97,1008.107,1029.228,"I would urge you to use city funding for real housing, real services that include the people that are expressing homelessness, black lives matter, and black people are disproportionately affected by Sweeps and the discarding of their belongings during these Sweeps.",28,,

190,0.97,1301.767,1311.076,Including the most challenging prices that we have faced in the last 100 years in the form of the Covid-19 pandemic.,34,,
191,0.97,1311.076,1316.014,The list of public health issues to deal with is a long one.,34,,
192,0.97,1316.014,1317.015,I hit the ground running.,34,,
193,0.97,1317.015,1320.752,I look forward to learning more about the specific issues in various parts of this region.,34,,

198,0.97,1341.606,1346.478,Thank you.,35,,
199,0.97,1346.478,1357.923,"As a brought to attention yesterday during Council briefings, normally an appointment like this would be done over two meetings.",35,,
200,0.97,1357.923,1361.86,The first meeting just being a brief introduction.,35,,
201,0.97,1361.86,1379.444,The second meeting would be a more comprehensive delving into the responses received by the appointment to questions the Council put together.,35,,
202,0.97,1379.444,1395.494,"Because of the short amount of time we have before going into the budget process, and in recognition that this is a dual body confirmation, the Seattle city council confirms the appointee as the Mayor's nomination.",35,,
203,0.97,1395.494,1398.597,King County Council does the same.,35,,
204,0.97,1398.597,1407.005,Because I did not want to lose any time in this process we are compressing the two steps into a single meeting.,35,,
205,0.97,1407.005,1416.648,Dr. khan was so good to quickly respond to the questions that the Council pulled together.,35,,
206,0.97,1416.648,1422.621,Those are attached to the agenda.,35,,
207,0.97,1422.621,1449.915,Before we dig into those questions I want to note that there was an oversight when this particular item was entered and updated into our legislative Database . as a result this appointment was not added to the introduction referral calendar to allow for a committee level vote this morning.,35,,
208,0.97,1449.915,1455.72,"When I say it will not allow for a committee vote this morning, that is a technical vote.",35,,
209,0.97,1455.72,1475.273,"I'm hoping that we can Express, should we decide to do so, express our Nonofficial support for the nomination moving on to the full Council on September 20th.",35,,
210,0.97,1475.273,1481.179,"I know the committee members have put a lot of care and time into reviewing materials, proposing questions, and considering this nomination as part of our oversight responsibility.",35,,
211,0.97,1481.179,1485.951,I am intending to call for a voice.,35,,
212,0.97,1485.951,1487.586,Maybe not call it a vote.,35,,
213,0.97,1487.586,1502.667,"A voice of support at the end of this agenda item, which again, unofficial, will be made known publicly and will constitute an informal--from the city.",35,,
214,0.97,1502.667,1504.069,I want to get that out there.,35,,
215,0.97,1504.069,1511.509,This anomaly has been discussed with the Mayor's office and we decided this would be the best course forward.,35,,
216,0.97,1511.509,1512.911,I so enjoyed meeting with Dr.,35,,
217,0.97,1512.911,1521.253,Khan in the Mayor's office to discuss Dr. khan's passions and interests in serving in this capacity.,35,,
218,0.97,1521.253,1526.558,We reviewed this plan and his interest in joining our community.,35,,
219,0.97,1526.558,1532.831,"His professional history, his accomplishments, I'm so glad you could join us here this morning.",35,,
220,0.97,1532.831,1538.57,"Dr. khan, I appreciated your open remarks.",35,,
221,0.97,1538.57,1542.507,What motivates you to work in public health?,35,,
222,0.97,1542.507,1546.177,Why are you interested in joining us here in Seattle?,35,,
223,0.97,1546.177,1548.046,Thank you.,36,,
224,0.97,1548.046,1552.35,"Public health, to me, is a personal and professional mission in life.",36,,
225,0.97,1552.35,1560.058,Public service is a calling.,36,,
226,0.97,1560.058,1579.21,"I recall my days in Med school when my colleagues were choosing exciting careers in clinical medicine and I was the Nerd who wanted to focus on preventing disease and finding out why it is that individuals, communities, and populations end up with decreasing health status indicators to begin with.",36,,
227,0.97,1579.21,1589.988,Over the last 26 years I have built a career in public health that has taken me to many different companies.,36,,
228,0.97,1589.988,1594.392,Sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa.,36,,
229,0.97,1594.392,1601.566,"And then finally to the United States, some 25 years ago.",36,,
230,0.97,1601.566,1607.505,"I have lived and worked in West Virginia, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and lately in Missouri.",36,,
231,0.97,1607.505,1622.087,I'll differ public health systems--in which how public health actually works in the United States and how it deliver services.,36,,
232,0.97,1622.087,1623.521,I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by trading.,36,,
233,0.97,1623.521,1636.534,I could not have imagined the scale of the worst public health crisis to have hit the world in 100 years when it finally hit us in early 2020.,36,,
234,0.97,1636.534,1651.816,"Throughout the last 2 1/2 years, as we have dealt with the pandemic, we have also focused on trying to retain and empower the public health workforce we rely on heavily.",36,,
235,0.97,1651.816,1655.887,That has been an entirely new mission in life.,36,,
236,0.97,1655.887,1663.528,"I place a very high premium on those efforts, looking into the next five or 10 years.",36,,
237,0.97,1663.528,1665.964,I approach my job with humility and openness.,36,,
238,0.97,1665.964,1673.672,Thank you.,36,,
239,0.97,1673.672,1674.439,Is there more?,37,,
240,0.97,1674.439,1675.206,That's it.,38,,
241,0.97,1675.206,1676.041,Thank you.,38,,
242,0.97,1676.041,1679.21,My apologies.,39,,
243,0.97,1679.21,1689.487,I am watching to see if any of my colleagues have questions.,39,,
244,0.97,1689.487,1689.854,If I.T.,39,,
245,0.97,1689.854,1702.067,"Is listening, or perhaps it's the clerk that needs to do this, I need to be added as a Panelist so I can see the Non- present participating.",39,,
246,0.97,1702.067,1702.801,Thank you very much.,39,,
247,0.97,1702.801,1703.635,I really appreciate it.,39,,
248,0.97,1703.635,1708.139,I can see whether or not my colleagues are raising their hand.,39,,

250,0.97,1714.312,1715.38,Thank you very much.,40,,
251,0.97,1715.38,1718.883,I will do one of those delving into questions here since we are on a compressed timescale.,40,,
252,0.97,1718.883,1723.588,"Excuse me, this might be long.",40,,
253,0.97,1723.588,1738.737,"Dr. khan, in a couple of your answers you spoke in favor noting that efforts in King County fizzled out because of public safety, impact, and legal statutory concerns.",40,,
254,0.97,1738.737,1741.806,You also said that in New York City initial reports indicate only minor operational issues.,40,,
255,0.97,1741.806,1750.248,I did a little bit of research on this initiative and found that it has no public funding.,40,,
256,0.97,1750.248,1752.05,That RAISES questions to me.,40,,
257,0.97,1752.05,1766.865,In California governor Gavin Newsom vetoed--once it was estimated to cost $2.6 million.,40,,
258,0.97,1766.865,1769.801,I'm always thinking about funding Trade-Offs.,40,,
259,0.97,1769.801,1776.407,When it comes to drug dependency treatment is my priority.,40,,
260,0.97,1776.407,1784.516,Cost was a big concern when it was debated when safe injection sites were divided in King County.,40,,
261,0.97,1784.516,1786.317,It was only about public safety and legal concerns.,40,,
262,0.97,1786.317,1787.519,Cost was an issue as well.,40,,
263,0.97,1787.519,1801.199,One of my questions asked about treatment . How can we better incorporate treatment into our response for homelessness?,40,,
264,0.97,1801.199,1804.068,You talked about funding as a major barrier to treatment.,40,,
265,0.97,1804.068,1811.242,But entities such as Seattle King County public health ought to look toward investing in treatment.,40,,
266,0.97,1811.242,1818.149,It comes back to limited resources.,40,,
267,0.97,1818.149,1819.584,I'm just wondering how you balance that.,40,,
268,0.97,1819.584,1824.055,"You talk to, just a moment ago, about prevention.",40,,
269,0.97,1824.055,1829.127,Overdose prevention.,40,,
270,0.97,1829.127,1833.898,The reason I'm focused on treatment is because it goes even farther upstream in preventing Overdoses by helping people overcome addiction.,40,,
271,0.97,1833.898,1837.168,How do you balance those two policy issues?,40,,
272,0.97,1837.168,1846.177,Safe injection sites and inpatient or outpatient treatment.,40,,
273,0.97,1846.177,1851.416,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",41,,
274,0.97,1851.416,1855.186,This is not an issue that I think it's going to be resolved in the short term.,41,,
275,0.97,1855.186,1859.357,I say that only because you are actually right.,41,,
276,0.97,1859.357,1866.931,Long-term funding and Sustainability remain key unanswered questions.,41,,
277,0.97,1866.931,1867.465,Resources are limited.,41,,
278,0.97,1867.465,1876.274,The Federal Government's real sources are made available through the substance use and mental health services administration.,41,,
279,0.97,1876.274,1883.982,They are fairly limited and come with strict restrictions on what those funds are usable for.,41,,
280,0.97,1883.982,1885.683,Just switching tracks a little.,41,,
281,0.97,1885.683,1904.836,"The New York City initiative is something Im keeping a close eye on in terms of finding out what their evaluation, reports, and data reveal six months from now and a year from now.",41,,
282,0.97,1904.836,1907.739,Their challenge will be long- term Sustainability and funding.,41,,
283,0.97,1907.739,1924.255,"I'm encouraged to see that there is a fair degree of unofficial, if not official cooperation between law enforcement, attorneys office, it is an experiment that is worth watching and keeping an eye on and learning from.",41,,
284,0.97,1924.255,1928.359,What lessons will come through 6 to 11 months from now?,41,,
285,0.97,1928.359,1929.193,12 months from now?,41,,
286,0.97,1929.193,1932.997,We simply don't know yet.,41,,
287,0.97,1932.997,1941.706,On the treatment front the availability and accessibility of treatment options throughout the community is a major challenge.,41,,
288,0.97,1941.706,1948.546,Unless we get to that point we will struggle to deal with this issue.,41,,
289,0.97,1948.546,1960.091,"There isn't enough funding in the public sector, given the wide variety of competing priorities within public health, to sustain any such effort over time.",41,,
290,0.97,1960.091,1980.545,"Whether it is a combination of public sector, private sector, combined effort, whether it is private or Foundational funds or a combination of public sector funds and Federal funds that are made available specifically for this purpose, that remains to be seen.",41,,
291,0.97,1980.545,1991.456,"I'm encouraged to see what the office of national drug control policy has, and is now beginning to talk about.",41,,
292,0.97,1991.456,1993.791,I don't know what stage of the process they are at.,41,,
293,0.97,1993.791,2003.735,They are beginning to roll out their plans in terms of addressing treatment options and availability in major Metro areas.,41,,
294,0.97,2003.735,2005.97,Has been one of the major discussion items there.,41,,
295,0.97,2005.97,2010.174,I'm excited to see what that looks like.,41,,
296,0.97,2010.174,2020.618,"My fear remains they will take a one solution fits all approach, which may not have the desired results.",41,,
297,0.97,2020.618,2024.255,I look forward to having further conversations about this.,41,,
298,0.97,2024.255,2027.592,Thank you.,42,,
299,0.97,2027.592,2058.389,"As it relates specifically to the issue, two things I want to say, although we have not built a bricks and mortar safe injection Overdose prevention facility here in King County, under the leadership of Rob Johnson, I did provide $1.5 million initially for a bricks and mortar facility.",42,,
300,0.97,2058.389,2061.826,The dollars were sent to King County public health.,42,,
301,0.97,2061.826,2084.115,"Under their guidance and leadership, rather than investing in a bricks and mortar facility, we instead invested in the services in existing facilities that provide treatment and see this population of folks with substance abuse disorder.",42,,
302,0.97,2084.115,2089.22,I just want to clarify the outcome of our investments in these Life-Saving services.,42,,
303,0.97,2089.22,2105.636,"As it relates to funding for treatment, I want to bring to your attention, Dr. khan, the Opioid distributor settlement, and the fact we have 11 days until the Sign-On deadline for that settlement.",42,,
304,0.97,2105.636,2125.556,"I understand, from the state AG, that if we do not have 116 of the 125 eligible local governments return a participation form, neither the state nor local government will receive any of the $518 million settlement.",42,,
305,0.97,2125.556,2128.426,40 eligible jurisdictions are from King County.,42,,
306,0.97,2128.426,2140.571,I do not know if any of those 40 eligible jurisdictions have not sent in their participation form yet.,42,,
307,0.97,2140.571,2147.111,"Given your freshness on the job, if you determine whether or not any King County jurisdictions are doing so or have not done so.",42,,
308,0.97,2147.111,2178.376,"I am requesting, if you haven't already or the King County board of health has a look further into the issue, that we don't lose $518 million in public funding because of lack of participation of a King County board of health or jurisdiction.",42,,
309,0.97,2179.343,2198.095,"One question I did want to ask, it relates to a statement I made earlier about the fact the nomination is put forward by both the Mayor and the county executive and must be confirmed by both the Seattle city Council and the King County city council.",42,,
310,0.97,2198.095,2202.833,The city of Seattle also has oversight of the work.,42,,
311,0.97,2202.833,2211.108,"I'm wondering, as the director, Dr. khan, you will have responsibility of both entities.",42,,
312,0.97,2211.108,2227.224,"I'm hoping you can speak to how you can manage the nuance of having a responsibility both to the city and the county, and how you will handle it in cases where there is conflict or a difference between the two.",42,,
313,0.97,2227.224,2234.999,Diplomacy is a skill that I have practiced and polished over the last 25 years.,43,,
314,0.97,2234.999,2243.107,I would expect to deploy it in generous amounts in negotiating any such points of conflict.,43,,
315,0.97,2243.107,2248.946,"Clarity of communication, and managing expectations, is my job.",43,,
316,0.97,2248.946,2266.364,I would expect to maintain clear channels of communication with both of the city and the county to make sure the public health agenda remains something that we continue to discuss out of greater detail.,43,,
317,0.97,2266.364,2274.605,"Yes, the band with the off of the public health workforce and the resources available to us are finite.",43,,
318,0.97,2274.605,2282.813,It is true that public health cannot take on endless work or Úevery new issue that comes along.,43,,
319,0.97,2282.813,2288.552,We have got to figure out how to distribute the workload and how to manage expectations.,43,,
320,0.97,2288.552,2309.006,"In those instances my hope would be to reach out and to have meaningful conversations and build a rapport with Councilmembers, aides, and staff.",43,,
321,0.97,2309.006,2311.409,"Whether the answer is, yes, we have agreement.",43,,
322,0.97,2311.409,2327.258,Or we will put this on the back Burner . There needs to be clear communication about that and a clear understanding across both parts involved.,43,,
323,0.97,2327.258,2328.492,"Easier said than done, I know.",43,,
324,0.97,2328.492,2330.561,I'm sure there will be points of confusion and tension.,43,,
325,0.97,2330.561,2332.43,But hope to negotiate those individually as they develop.,43,,
326,0.97,2332.43,2333.364,Thank you.,43,,
327,0.97,2333.364,2335.199,Thank you.,44,,
328,0.97,2335.199,2342.64,I need to see if my colleagues have additional questions that they want to include here.,44,,
329,0.97,2342.64,2348.913,Let's see.,45,,
330,0.97,2348.913,2353.184,One other important question I want to put on the table.,45,,
331,0.97,2353.184,2374.939,"As we know, the past two and half years have been incredible for the public health workforce, which was depleted before the pandemic and then asked to step up very quickly to lead response, save lives.",45,,
332,0.97,2374.939,2376.607,We have done this very effective in King County.,45,,
333,0.97,2376.607,2378.442,We really owe them a debt of gratitude.,45,,
334,0.97,2378.442,2386.05,"I'm wondering if you can say a few words about how you would approach leading an organization with an exhausted workforce, for which we are very grateful.",45,,
335,0.97,2386.05,2392.056,That is priority one for me.,46,,
336,0.97,2392.056,2392.79,Personally and professionally.,46,,
337,0.97,2392.79,2400.564,Having experienced the energy sapping exercise during the pandemic over the last two years.,46,,
338,0.97,2400.564,2410.941,"I stated earlier that you are fortunate to have, at your service, one of the best public health agencies in the country.",46,,
339,0.97,2410.941,2415.212,And that means one of the best workforces in the country.,46,,
340,0.97,2415.212,2422.453,"That workforce is averaging good people, qualified staff, experienced staff.",46,,
341,0.97,2422.453,2435.699,We need to stop that to the best of our ability . do whatever we can to take care of those people.,46,,
342,0.97,2435.699,2436.5,Our teams are exhausted.,46,,
343,0.97,2436.5,2444.809,"They are mentally, physically, socially, and emotionally drained as a result of what they have had to do during the pandemic.",46,,
344,0.97,2444.809,2450.347,They are mostly underpaid and Underappreciated of the best of days.,46,,
345,0.97,2450.347,2451.982,That is the lot of public health nationwide.,46,,
346,0.97,2451.982,2467.231,"My personal goal is to make sure we offer them flexible work schedules, make their jobs as enjoyable as possible by Re- engaging them in meaningful developmental work . personally and professionally.",46,,

348,0.97,2476.64,2478.509,That will be a long-term prospect.,46,,
349,0.97,2478.509,2484.915,The pipeline of new talent coming into the public sector workforce is growing.,46,,
350,0.97,2484.915,2503.367,"Opening up that Spigot once again, Nurturing those individuals into Entry-Level jobs so that they are ready to take over the reins of public health 20 or 25 years into the future will be the most insurmountable challenge in front of us.",46,,
351,0.97,2503.367,2513.611,I am committed to making that a possibility into reality in the future.,46,,
352,0.97,2513.611,2523.654,I look forward to engaging all Councilmembers and entertaining all ideas you might have.,46,,

370,0.97,2613.344,2617.581,"It's only one public health systems fail that people start to wonder, why is my water Brown?",48,,
371,0.97,2617.581,2621.919,Why aren't systems working?,48,,

411,0.97,2842.739,2846.009,Hopefully some of you have had an opportunity to take him up on that offer.,58,,
412,0.97,2846.009,2858.155,"For those fortunate enough to have the opportunity to connect with him, I'm hoping you have been as impressed with him as I am in his lived experience, his professional record, and his vision for accountability in our city.",58,,
413,0.97,2858.155,2861.692,I know all of you are not here to hear from me.,58,,
414,0.97,2861.692,2874.071,I think you for allowing our legal counsel to present Gino him as a cook--as I took a rare vacation.,58,,

418,0.97,2881.845,2899.196,"I will note that a trusted accountability system is the only way we are going to achieve full and effective compliance with the Federal consent to create, which is why Mayor Harrell did not make his decision to appoint Gino Betts Jr. lately.",58,,
419,0.97,2899.196,2904.067,With that I would love to present Gino to you.,58,,

427,0.97,2934.298,2936.3,My name is Gino Betts Jr.,60,,
428,0.97,2936.3,2939.836,"Thank you, senior deputy Mayor Harrell for your comments.",60,,
429,0.97,2939.836,2949.746,Thank you for your consideration of me as OPA director.,60,,
430,0.97,2949.746,2953.25,I also want to thank you for the second opportunity to appear before your Committee.,60,,
431,0.97,2953.25,2957.754,"My last appearance, I had a chance to outline my personal and professional experiences.",60,,
432,0.97,2957.754,2966.163,Both have prepared me for this opportunity.,60,,
433,0.97,2966.163,2968.999,As a boy in Chicago's Inner- city I was routinely subjected to unconstitutional police practices.,60,,
434,0.97,2968.999,2990.32,"I grew up to fight against police misconduct as an attorney . I served as a community justice assistant attorney, where they work Side-By-Side with community leaders and local Stakeholders to reduce violence and problem solve concerns on Chicago's South side.",60,,
435,0.97,2990.32,2993.557,Last time I also left you with little commitments.,60,,
436,0.97,2993.557,2998.562,Committed to availing myself for One-On-One conversations with each of you.,60,,
437,0.97,2998.562,3004.334,I want to thank you to all who are available for those meetings.,60,,
438,0.97,3004.334,3006.036,I appreciated your insight and your questions.,60,,
439,0.97,3006.036,3016.58,I look forward to working with any of those that were unavailable for those meetings.,60,,
440,0.97,3016.58,3018.949,I am further committed to bringing OPA closer to the community.,60,,
441,0.97,3018.949,3022.052,Since then I have started reaching out for meaningful and valuable community input.,60,,
442,0.97,3022.052,3035.399,"Specifically, I met with the local Naacp officials, power Washington, the CPC, and others, to understand public expectations for the OPA director.",60,,
443,0.97,3035.399,3042.706,I also committed to working closely with oversight workers to increase public confidence in the police accountability system.,60,,
444,0.97,3042.706,3053.984,To that end I have met with all Stakeholders and left encouraged by their hard work and dedication to making Seattle a national model for police oversight.,60,,
445,0.97,3053.984,3060.857,"I appreciate that these are just the beginning steps of a very long journey toward healing, unity, and reconciliation.",60,,
446,0.97,3060.857,3067.864,If confirmed by further commit to taking this journey with you each step of the way.,60,,
447,0.97,3067.864,3070.333,Thank you and I look forward to any questions you may have.,60,,
448,0.97,3070.333,3073.403,Thank you so much.,61,,
449,0.97,3073.403,3081.711,We appreciate everything you have been doing in this roll since you have taken on the position.,61,,
450,0.97,3081.711,3084.815,As of August 1ST you have fulfilled your commitments to us.,61,,
451,0.97,3084.815,3094.024,And you began the important engagement that will be so successful for you to build trust.,61,,
452,0.97,3094.024,3102.933,"As you say, the most important measure of success in this roll is community trust in the police accountability system.",61,,
453,0.97,3102.933,3108.805,I really enjoyed reading your remarks in the written questionnaire.,61,,
454,0.97,3108.805,3117.214,I have enjoyed meeting with you in both of the hearing committee and the selection process interviews.,61,,
455,0.97,3117.214,3124.054,I really appreciate how clear you are about your positions.,61,,
456,0.97,3124.054,3137.167,Often answers that we received these confirmation questions are answered that are designed to please everyone.,61,,
457,0.97,3137.167,3142.372,I really appreciate two issues in particular that I think Seattle has had different experiences with in our leadership of the OPA.,61,,
458,0.97,3142.372,3164.828,"Your steadfast commitment to rule on OPA cases based on the merits of the case rather than a concern about how they might fare in the outcome of an appeal is very, very important to the integrity of the OPA investigation system.",61,,
459,0.97,3164.828,3171.835,If there are other problems in the discipline system they should be dealt with there.,61,,
460,0.97,3171.835,3193.69,"By ensuring you are making your decisions not based on a fear or concern that a case might be overturned in appeal you are allowing a bright light on the success of the OPA system, and also a bright light on areas of concern.",61,,
461,0.97,3193.69,3219.816,"I also appreciate, knowing of your background, coming from an accountability system that has a civilian iced investigation, and appreciate your strong support for a fully civilian iced OPA investigation system.",61,,
462,0.97,3219.816,3224.287,"That is a really important issue to the community, as you probably heard in public comment today.",61,,
463,0.97,3224.287,3234.464,One thing I do want to make clear for the public is the 2017 accountability ordinance does require 100% Civilianization.,61,,
464,0.97,3234.464,3242.205,"That ordinance was, in 2017, fully supported by the Council, included by myself.",61,,
465,0.97,3242.205,3247.177,This is a move that historically there has been strong support for.,61,,
466,0.97,3247.177,3268.398,We do recognize that those are items that need to be bargained and would think it would be really important and valuable to have your partnership in the roll that we have carved out for our accountability partners in the bargaining process.,61,,
467,0.97,3268.398,3287.05,"I'm really impressed with your experience, your passion for the work, and your strong vision for what accountability means and what success for an accountability system would look like.",61,,
468,0.97,3287.05,3289.653,I do want to ask a question.,61,,
469,0.97,3289.653,3295.058,"You use the word, radical transparency, and one of her questions.",61,,
470,0.97,3295.058,3304.934,"I'm wondering, are there things that you think of as radical transparency that historically have not been doing, that we should be doing?",61,,
471,0.97,3304.934,3307.27,We talk about transparency.,61,,
472,0.97,3307.27,3336.366,"There is a lot of good transparency with OPA, with getting out information about the status of cases with having an advocate who communicates about the status of cases, and also about putting information out . What do you see as radical transparency that might be something new that we should be doing?",61,,
473,0.97,3336.366,3343.273,The next steps in transparency would be to release all police Video.,62,,
474,0.97,3343.273,3355.418,"Body worn Video, in car Video, police reports, anything that we have on hand that the public can scrutinize . How did you assess this?",62,,
475,0.97,3355.418,3356.219,We saw this ourselves.,62,,
476,0.97,3356.219,3363.793,So they can take us to task and we can justify at that point.,62,,
477,0.97,3363.793,3366.73,That is my position.,62,,
478,0.97,3366.73,3370.6,We should be heading in that direction.,62,,
479,0.97,3370.6,3378.675,"Specifically, I would like to see it done expeditiously.",62,,
480,0.97,3378.675,3381.344,I would like to see it within 30 days of the complaint being filed.,62,,
481,0.97,3381.344,3382.445,Thank you.,63,,
482,0.97,3382.445,3386.049,Councilmember Mosqueda?,63,,
483,0.97,3386.049,3386.85,Thank you.,64,,
484,0.97,3386.85,3389.786,I did not want to interrupt the flow if you had other questions as well.,64,,
485,0.97,3389.786,3395.258,I did not get the chance to meet you at the last meeting.,64,,
486,0.97,3395.258,3397.694,"I wanted to say, thank you for your interest in this position.",64,,
487,0.97,3397.694,3400.363,I do like the term radical transparency.,64,,
488,0.97,3400.363,3404.467,I am aggressively Elaborative.,64,,
489,0.97,3404.467,3411.508,I like the merging of those two words.,64,,
490,0.97,3411.508,3413.743,I also have outstanding questions to our community members as well.,64,,
491,0.97,3413.743,3416.246,I wanted to ask you a few questions.,64,,
492,0.97,3416.246,3423.653,"Madam chair, if you need to go to other Councilmembers feel free to cut me off.",64,,
493,0.97,3423.653,3440.336,"In the question and answer, one of the extra steps would you make sure the suggested policy change actually results in harm reduction or bias policing?",64,,
494,0.97,3440.336,3446.075,I do not see an answer that specifically spoke to harm reduction or bias free policing.,64,,
495,0.97,3446.075,3449.846,Could you elaborate more on what you would like to do in this position?,64,,
496,0.97,3449.846,3453.483,Especially Unbiased policing.,64,,
497,0.97,3453.483,3456.553,We do review allegations of bias.,65,,
498,0.97,3456.553,3463.126,"We investigate those matters thoroughly, objectively, completely.",65,,
499,0.97,3463.126,3472.502,The part of the question I kind of focused on was what steps I would take if SPD was resistant to the reforms that we recommended.,65,,
500,0.97,3472.502,3484.047,"Specifically, I do believe in engaging our oversight partners.",65,,
501,0.97,3484.047,3489.853,If that is insufficient to get the job done I also believe in making a case directly to the people.,65,,
502,0.97,3489.853,3502.999,The people in Seattle have not been shy about demanding what they deem to be appropriate in Community-Based policing.,65,,
503,0.97,3502.999,3505.268,I believe in making that case directly to the people.,65,,
504,0.97,3505.268,3512.208,The people that demonstrated that they can take it from there and make their voice heard and their demands clear.,65,,
505,0.97,3512.208,3513.91,I will do a quick follow-up.,66,,
506,0.97,3513.91,3519.716,I think you are touching on some of the restrictions on this position.,66,,
507,0.97,3519.716,3528.157,The fact that the OPA has enforcement authority as the challenge.,66,,
508,0.97,3528.157,3535.832,Just being in a position to make recommendations to SPD for potential disciplinary action or policy changes might not actually be implemented.,66,,
509,0.97,3535.832,3553.316,You have thoughts about how to strengthen your roll? or how to ensure that the OPA's recommendations are consistently responded to if they are disregarded.,66,,
510,0.97,3553.316,3555.151,I'm encouraged by our past relationship with SPD.,67,,
511,0.97,3555.151,3557.754,The gross majority of our recommendations have been fully implemented.,67,,
512,0.97,3557.754,3560.223,Some of them were partially implement it.,67,,
513,0.97,3560.223,3567.03,There are circumstances where none of them have been implemented.,67,,
514,0.97,3567.03,3580.443,"When that happens, again, I believe there are alternative responses that we can make, including engaging our partner Stakeholders.",67,,
515,0.97,3580.443,3586.749,I believe there are five that were not implemented in 2021. probably around 26.,68,,
516,0.97,3586.749,3594.824,Those are all on the dashboard.,68,,
517,0.97,3594.824,3616.713,"One of the points that I'm hearing is there have been efforts to push out the progress, or lack there of, of implementation of SPD management action recommendations from the OPA, and to make that public.",68,,
518,0.97,3616.713,3619.349,I hear Mr. Gino Betts Jr.,68,,
519,0.97,3619.349,3629.959,Saying that simply being transparent about those recommendations and the status of them is insufficient.,68,,
520,0.97,3629.959,3650.98,I think I'm hearing this concept of radical transparency and maybe going out to engage with community in a more Proactive way about the status of implemented management recommendations.,68,,
521,0.97,3650.98,3663.659,"It might be warranted in some cases, depending on whether or not they are minor or very critical recommendations.",68,,
522,0.97,3663.659,3671.034,"Of the five that have not been implemented, they aren't all of the same nature.",68,,
523,0.97,3671.034,3671.868,Right.,69,,
524,0.97,3671.868,3684.881,I do agree the community should have input on any policy recommendations . We want to make sure the policy meets the needs of the community.,69,,
525,0.97,3684.881,3687.383,That is top priority.,69,,
526,0.97,3687.383,3689.052,That is the front end accountability portion.,69,,
527,0.97,3689.052,3705.735,"When it comes to the back and accountability of investigating individual cases, I do believe I need autonomy and space to evaluate each case on a Case-By- case basis without any external influences.",69,,
528,0.97,3705.735,3715.778,Whether it is SPD or the community for that matter.,69,,
529,0.97,3715.778,3723.653,I have a question about your question.,70,,
530,0.97,3723.653,3726.122,"Councilmember Mosqueda, can we switch over to Council member Nelson?",71,,
531,0.97,3726.122,3726.722,That sounds good.,72,,
532,0.97,3726.722,3730.193,I will hold questions for the other colleagues.,72,,
533,0.97,3730.193,3731.027,Council member Nelson?,73,,
534,0.97,3731.027,3743.272,I don't know enough about the division of labor between OPA and the other bodies of our accountability system.,74,,
535,0.97,3743.272,3761.891,"When you said there is more transparency, that they should go out into the community to talk about accepted recommendations, are they supposed to do that?",74,,
536,0.97,3761.891,3764.26,Or does OPA work with CPC to engage community?,74,,
537,0.97,3764.26,3768.164,What are the bodies?,74,,
538,0.97,3768.164,3783.412,I ask because I'm sure the investigatory body of work is going to be taking up most of your time.,74,,
539,0.97,3783.412,3785.047,"Was that question directed to me, council member?",75,,
540,0.97,3785.047,3789.752,It was a question to Council member Herbold.,76,,
541,0.97,3789.752,3793.489,Sure.,77,,
542,0.97,3793.489,3805.735,"It is within OPA's Wheelhouse to make policy recommendations and to work with SPD to implement them, as well as to notify members of the public of what those recommendations are.",77,,
543,0.97,3805.735,3812.842,I think that's what we were talking about.,77,,
544,0.97,3812.842,3831.861,"What my plan is to do is to have a closeout meeting after each investigation is fully investigated and invite the complainant to come to OPA so we can outline everything that we considered how we reached our findings, how we got there.",78,,
545,0.97,3831.861,3834.063,Now I'm not expecting us to agree on each outcome.,78,,
546,0.97,3834.063,3840.503,But I think that level of transparency will add towards community confidence in the overall system.,78,,
547,0.97,3840.503,3845.374,So that's what my ultimate goal is.,78,,
548,0.97,3845.374,3850.513,Thank you.,79,,
549,0.97,3850.513,3854.25,Senior deputy Mayor Harold?,80,,
550,0.97,3854.25,3857.987,Thank you.,81,,
551,0.97,3857.987,3866.729,I will add to a little bit of what Councilmember Nelson was asking.,81,,
552,0.97,3866.729,3873.135,There is a responsibility for each of the accountability partners to play their roll within this process.,81,,
553,0.97,3873.135,3885.448,The community police Commission is a key partner in the community engagement and community outreach.,81,,
554,0.97,3885.448,3899.795,It should be part of the entire process that each of the legs of the stool of the accountability for rabbit are doing the roles they are supposed to do.,81,,
555,0.97,3899.795,3902.898,But also inform each other as to the parts they will play in the process.,81,,
556,0.97,3902.898,3916.712,I think it's really critical for the CPC to be involved and engaged in community and in making a communities voice heard through the process.,81,,
557,0.97,3916.712,3932.662,"But also being able to take the information they learned from OPA, translated out to community, and then get the feedback and translate that back out to the community partners.",81,,
558,0.97,3932.662,3939.568,"I recognize that we have somewhat inherited a process, like in any good House foundation, you want to shore it up.",81,,
559,0.97,3939.568,3945.541,You want to make sure it's in good shape.,81,,
560,0.97,3945.541,3946.575,We've built a house.,81,,
561,0.97,3946.575,3948.411,There were a couple years where the foundation was settled.,81,,
562,0.97,3948.411,3957.453,We need to be Shored up so we can remain sturdy.,81,,
563,0.97,3957.453,3960.89,Having a really strong OPA director allows us to shore up part of the foundation.,81,,
564,0.97,3960.89,3967.396,And also ensure that we are working with our other partners to ensure they have solid foundations too.,81,,
565,0.97,3967.396,3975.404,I want to thank Councilmember Nelson for that question.,81,,
566,0.97,3975.404,3979.241,It is received in terms of all of the work we want to do with our accountability.,81,,
567,0.97,3979.241,3980.71,The entire accountability system.,81,,
568,0.97,3980.71,3983.946,Thank you.,82,,
569,0.97,3983.946,3986.382,I have one more question.,82,,
570,0.97,3986.382,3991.987,"Councilmember Mosqueda, if you want to go ahead I will hold mine.",82,,
571,0.97,3991.987,3995.024,Sure.,83,,
572,0.97,3995.024,4000.162,This question is about process.,83,,
573,0.97,4000.162,4011.674,"Senior deputy Mayor, the process is more on your end.",83,,
574,0.97,4011.674,4014.176,"It is about follow-through, given some concerns around the process for the appointment.",83,,
575,0.97,4014.176,4019.248,We know there has been some discomfort expressed from community members that the process did not have adequate time built-in for engagement via public forms.,83,,
576,0.97,4019.248,4022.284,We know that there was putting public form that was put forward.,83,,
577,0.97,4022.284,4032.128,"We saw some reporting at the end of July, the publication of the new form coincided with a media request.",83,,
578,0.97,4032.128,4037.133,"It RAISES again, the question of building trust with community and making sure people feel like their feedback was included.",83,,
579,0.97,4037.133,4050.746,"How would you, in its position as OPA director, work to bring Seattle residents it's the process, given that some folks may still feel that their voice wasn't being heard?",83,,
580,0.97,4050.746,4054.283,What is the first step will do toward building trust?,83,,
581,0.97,4054.283,4057.787,You reached out to a number of Stakeholders.,83,,
582,0.97,4057.787,4065.194,How did the conversations go with the grassroots branch and so on?,83,,
583,0.97,4065.194,4076.806,"I hope that is more of a question for the incoming appointee about how you really try to build trust, given some of the discomfort that has been discussed by community members.",83,,
584,0.97,4076.806,4090.586,"Gino, before you start, let me first acknowledge that the process fell short of what is ideal.",84,,
585,0.97,4090.586,4094.924,I have also personally reached out to some of the Stakeholders and expressed that.,84,,
586,0.97,4094.924,4099.595,One of the things that I think is a little bit unfair is the process fell short.,84,,
587,0.97,4099.595,4107.67,The executive branch has identified that we commit to doing better.,84,,
588,0.97,4107.67,4117.513,There were some decisions made that the candidate certainly had no input or bearing on.,84,,
589,0.97,4117.513,4126.589,It is important that those decisions that have to follow the candidate through the Intro of their time with the city.,84,,
590,0.97,4126.589,4132.127,We found an excellent candidate.,84,,
591,0.97,4132.127,4133.596,We fell short.,84,,
592,0.97,4133.596,4134.63,The executive branch fell short.,84,,
593,0.97,4134.63,4139.935,We have made internal corrections and adjustments based on that.,84,,
594,0.97,4139.935,4146.909,We have also worked with the candidate to let them know the process that they walked in on.,84,,
595,0.97,4146.909,4154.45,He has made a strong commitment to help us regain that trust and support within community.,84,,
596,0.97,4154.45,4161.056,I will let Gino Betts Jr. speak to this.,84,,
597,0.97,4161.056,4169.732,We have identified where we have had some shortcomings and we have been working to fix it.,84,,
598,0.97,4169.732,4184.079,"I really hope that the public doesn't hold the process, which selected an excellent candidate, against the candidate who is one of the best that we can possibly ask for.",84,,
599,0.97,4184.079,4195.391,"I have been extremely impressed with not only Gino's experience and breadth of knowledge, but also his heart and commitment.",84,,
600,0.97,4195.391,4202.064,You just cannot find those things in every individual.,84,,
601,0.97,4202.064,4206.402,We asked for a Unicorn and quite candidly we got one.,84,,
602,0.97,4206.402,4214.643,There is work that we will do to support earning the public's trust around this.,84,,
603,0.97,4214.643,4223.986,But certainly I don't want to follow an excellent candidate for a position that is extremely hard to deliver on.,84,,
604,0.97,4223.986,4234.229,"But I believe can deliver for the city of Seattle . Gino, I will direct it to you now.",84,,
605,0.97,4234.229,4243.439,I do appreciate that each Stakeholder has a roll when it comes to police accountability.,85,,
606,0.97,4243.439,4248.143,"I do believe, nevertheless, there is a roll for OPA to work directly with the community.",85,,
607,0.97,4248.143,4256.318,Specifically when it comes to the complaint filing process being accessible to the committee.,85,,
608,0.97,4256.318,4259.321,"You can do in person, you can do it Online, you can mailing your complaint.",85,,
609,0.97,4259.321,4266.695,I think we can do a better job of spreading the awareness of OPA.,85,,
610,0.97,4266.695,4270.532,I don't think enough people know about the function of OPA.,85,,
611,0.97,4270.532,4277.706,If you have a bad encounter with the police officer there is an agency Tasked with investigating the situation.,85,,
612,0.97,4277.706,4278.307,That is one part.,85,,
613,0.97,4278.307,4280.109,Just being visible in the community.,85,,
614,0.97,4280.109,4286.682,Another component is meaningfully valuing the input of the community.,85,,
615,0.97,4286.682,4291.053,"The community, historically, they feel like they have not been heard.",85,,
616,0.97,4291.053,4303.832,"So I think having that meaningful integration in the community, that will go a long way toward building the public trust that I'm pursuing.",85,,
617,0.97,4303.832,4316.045,"Madam chair, one last question if you are still seeking questions.",86,,
618,0.97,4316.045,4318.147,I'm going to go ahead and ask it I think.,86,,
619,0.97,4318.147,4319.381,"I cannot hear you, Madam chair.",86,,
620,0.97,4319.381,4320.115,Cut me off.,86,,
621,0.97,4320.115,4321.216,"I said, go for it.",87,,
622,0.97,4321.216,4321.617,Okay.,88,,
623,0.97,4321.617,4322.584,Great.,88,,
624,0.97,4322.584,4329.491,I will go for it.,88,,
625,0.97,4329.491,4334.997,I really love that the chair has been so generous with having you in the committee twice.,88,,
626,0.97,4334.997,4339.301,I apologize as well that I was not able to ask some of these questions on the first go around.,88,,
627,0.97,4339.301,4341.337,This one is related to some of the past work.,88,,
628,0.97,4341.337,4345.207,In terms of building trust with the community.,88,,
629,0.97,4345.207,4351.78,"Not only an engagement process but with the past practices of OPA, one last question on this.",88,,
630,0.97,4351.78,4364.259,There has been recent media coverage in July of the OPA's apparent Misclassification of what appeared to be serious investigation where the allegations as contact law complaints.,88,,
631,0.97,4364.259,4374.169,"As we know, context logs are not subject to investigation and are effectively closed according to the OPA manual.",88,,
632,0.97,4374.169,4384.113,Including complaints in this category that relate to an officer's sexual misconduct.,88,,
633,0.97,4384.113,4388.917,"Retaliation, bias, as well as 40 other complaints.",88,,
634,0.97,4388.917,4392.988,Grouped together as one complaint and classified as a contact log.,88,,
635,0.97,4392.988,4409.371,"My question for you, given your responsibility and the work of the OPA director to oversee classification of the complaints, how do you plan to address these concerns that have been apparently Well- documented?",88,,
636,0.97,4409.371,4414.943,And also future efforts to make sure we are not Miss classifying contacts?,88,,
637,0.97,4414.943,4418.013,I am aware of those concerns and allegations.,89,,
638,0.97,4418.013,4422.351,I will say that there is a mechanism currently in place to deal with it.,89,,
639,0.97,4422.351,4428.457,"Oig, they do audit our contact log and classifications.",89,,
640,0.97,4428.457,4430.192,I am coming in as a new director.,89,,
641,0.97,4430.192,4445.073,So I will be taking a look at our classification process and how we can improve that going forward.,89,,
642,0.97,4445.073,4456.118,Just as more texture to the viewing public . They review investigations.,90,,
643,0.97,4456.118,4466.829,As an audit function I believe they can audit the use of contact logs.,90,,
644,0.97,4466.829,4474.87,"Typically, things that are identified as complaints for an investigation, they review each one of those for thoroughness, timeliness, and objectivity.",90,,
645,0.97,4474.87,4479.007,And the certification memos.,90,,
646,0.97,4479.007,4489.518,"It is not clear to me that they do that with contact logs, which I think is the point Councilmember Mosqueda is raising.",90,,
647,0.97,4489.518,4513.642,"This is still more broadly an area, not only for the incoming director, but it's also an area where the Oig can take a look at it as a systemwide area.",90,,
648,0.97,4513.642,4525.32,"I'm wanting to move on to one more question I have in your written answers, or about your written answers.",90,,
649,0.97,4525.32,4534.363,You talk about the New Orleans office of independent monitor being nationally Lauded for its program.,90,,
650,0.97,4534.363,4546.608,You know to that post mediation surveys will--found the process was Unbiased and appreciated the opportunity to talk about their differences.,90,,
651,0.97,4546.608,4558.253,"Our most recent public survey of Complainants that I recall seeing last year, or perhaps it was early this year.",90,,
652,0.97,4558.253,4566.428,It does show a high level of dissatisfaction with the process.,90,,
653,0.97,4566.428,4571.767,I do not believe the survey was focused on folks that go through mediation alone.,90,,
654,0.97,4571.767,4593.855,"But I would like to know, from you, whether or not there are differences that you are aware of between our mediation system and the New Orleans mediation approach that we should consider adopting?",90,,
655,0.97,4593.855,4601.73,"I do know that it has plummeted in recent years, since about 2020.",91,,
656,0.97,4601.73,4603.765,We stopped doing Mediations almost totally.,91,,
657,0.97,4603.765,4609.371,Then we have done a few recently.,91,,
658,0.97,4609.371,4620.115,I'm not familiar with the surveys you are Referencing but I would love to take a look at that and compare it to the data that is collected by New Orleans and see how we can adapt going forward.,91,,
659,0.97,4620.115,4625.454,Thank you.,92,,
660,0.97,4625.454,4631.193,"Those that I'm Referencing did not focus on mediation, per se, but focused on users of the OPA complaint system.",92,,
661,0.97,4631.193,4639.635,We would love to talk to you more about the strengths that you see in the New Orleans mediation approach.,92,,
662,0.97,4639.635,4640.035,Absolutely.,93,,
663,0.97,4640.035,4657.285,"I will say that I do know that Complainants in the past have complained about the process of dealing with OPA, specifically the Infrequency of communications with OPA and the impersonal mess of those communications.",93,,
664,0.97,4657.285,4664.393,In the past they would just get a letter telling them what happened with their case.,93,,
665,0.97,4664.393,4671.933,In response we hired a complaint navigator to have frequent communication with the Complainants.,93,,
666,0.97,4671.933,4673.368,It is also personal to Munication.,93,,
667,0.97,4673.368,4678.273,"Phone calls, Emails, and so forth.",93,,
668,0.97,4678.273,4686.014,Really just making himself available to the Complainants throughout the process and making sure they understand the process from the beginning all the way through this position.,93,,
669,0.97,4686.014,4687.516,Perfect.,94,,
670,0.97,4687.516,4700.929,I just got a note that I want to go back to the contact log issue.,94,,
671,0.97,4700.929,4723.852,"Although Oig does not do certification memos for contact logs they started reviewing all contact logs about six months ago because of some of the issues you raised, Councilmember Mosqueda.",94,,
672,0.97,4723.852,4727.589,"They did, six months ago, start reviewing all contact logs.",95,,
673,0.97,4727.589,4731.293,They brought on a couple of new staff in their investigations unit.,95,,
674,0.97,4731.293,4733.762,They are reviewing every single one now.,95,,
675,0.97,4733.762,4736.064,Byerly they had been doing spot checks.,95,,
676,0.97,4736.064,4742.771,Now every single one that passes through gets reviewed.,95,,
677,0.97,4742.771,4748.977,Thank you for clarifying that they are not doing spot checks anymore and that they are doing all of them in real time.,96,,
678,0.97,4748.977,4750.846,I really appreciate it.,96,,
679,0.97,4750.846,4752.881,It is an important change.,96,,
680,0.97,4752.881,4762.157,"This just shows how this entire system, whether or not your talk about the OPA, Oig, or CPC.",96,,
681,0.97,4762.157,4785.914,It is an ever evolving system that is designed to be constantly reviewing itself and making improvements based on its past prior practices that are identified for improvement.,96,,
682,0.97,4790.452,4801.696,I'm seeing if any of our colleagues have additional questions for Gino or senior deputy Mayor Harrell.,96,,
683,0.97,4801.696,4808.87,I really appreciate that you have been here with us twice now.,96,,
684,0.97,4808.87,4823.218,"This appointment, again, is being done in line with the process that the Council established at the March 22nd committee meeting.",96,,
685,0.97,4823.218,4832.994,Senior deputy Mayor Harrell acknowledged that we did not give enough public notice for the public forum.,96,,
686,0.97,4832.994,4844.439,"I know that in that panel of discussion the moderator did have a lot of questions from members of the public, regardless of the short Timeframe.",96,,
687,0.97,4844.439,4858.887,"I'm really pleased that the public did participate in the way that it did, in sending questions on for consideration a public forum.",96,,
688,0.97,4858.887,4881.409,"I also really appreciate Gino, making such an effort to meet with the community Stakeholders with concerns about the public forum in his month and a half that he has been here with us on the job.",96,,
689,0.97,4881.409,4885.313,I'm hearing and seeing no further questions.,96,,

701,0.97,4936.831,4940.302,I did speak with members of CPC.,101,,
702,0.97,4940.302,4944.406,I know he's got strong support from that body.,101,,
703,0.97,4944.406,4952.847,When we spoke we focused on trust building.,101,,
704,0.97,4952.847,4960.789,I think that is key to improving and Reimagining the accountability of our police and public safety system.,101,,

716,0.97,5011.406,5024.519,"You said, the unfettered power of bargaining agreements offers arbitration hearings for placement's conduct behind closed doors.",103,,
717,0.97,5024.519,5026.521,It must be addressed but will not impact my decision-making.,103,,
718,0.97,5026.521,5040.535,"I really appreciate that you are calling out the different roles that you still have, even though there are areas that need additional improvement and transparency.",103,,
719,0.97,5040.535,5042.971,Perhaps radical transparency is something I look forward to hearing more about.,103,,

756,0.97,5179.741,5181.843,This is an update.,122,,
757,0.97,5181.843,5185.513,Not on the risk management demand study that SPD is doing.,122,,
758,0.97,5185.513,5194.722,"Although, I understand that study is Near-Complete.",122,,
759,0.97,5194.722,5200.962,We are aiming for a briefing from SPD on the 27th on that study.,122,,
760,0.97,5200.962,5203.064,Our last committee meeting of the year.,122,,
761,0.97,5203.064,5212.54,"But this is a briefing, I think we can consider a precursor to the risk management demand analysis.",122,,
762,0.97,5212.54,5225.32,It is really focused on the work that I keep referring to in committee between the Council and the executive . They EEP promising it's about to start.,122,,
763,0.97,5225.32,5232.627,We have had some agreement on goals and Timeline.,122,,
764,0.97,5232.627,5234.062,"Finally, we are there.",122,,
765,0.97,5234.062,5254.048,We have an agreement . We are referring to Itsarah Smith and Brianna Thomas.,122,,
766,0.97,5254.048,5273.334,"Really, really appreciate folks pushing up their sleeves and identifying a couple of areas that we can move more quickly on, well we are also analyzing the risk managed demand analysis.",122,,
767,0.97,5273.334,5275.57,"So I just want to turn it over to you, Esther.",122,,
768,0.97,5275.57,5284.746,Could you speak to what the term sheet says about the establishment of pilot programs?,122,,
769,0.97,5284.746,5285.513,I can.,123,,
770,0.97,5285.513,5300.528,"For the record, Esther handy, central staff director, here today to provide an update on the partnership we have been building between Council and the Mayor's office to advance alternative 911 response.",123,,
771,0.97,5300.528,5306.0,We have memorialized that in a term sheet.,123,,
772,0.97,5306.0,5307.869,This is a staff to staff document awaiting signature.,123,,
773,0.97,5307.869,5313.541,It is not a piece of legislation the Council will take formal action on.,123,,
774,0.97,5313.541,5322.784,In a moment I will walk through the highlights and expected work products that will come from this that will be in front of your Committee and inform the policymaking.,123,,
775,0.97,5322.784,5328.956,I will note that also from the staff team I have subject matter experts on the line.,123,,
776,0.97,5328.956,5336.064,They are working closely with me and available if specific questions about policy work comes up.,123,,
777,0.97,5336.064,5353.147,"This work is done--and senior deputy Mayor Harrell is also present and a deep appreciation to you, for moving this work along.",123,,
778,0.97,5353.147,5371.566,The work sits in the context of the broad body of work that the Council has been doing for several years to Reimagine and improve parts of our public safety system and improve the infrastructure from a more diverse set of 911 responses that meet all of the needs for folks calling the city's emergency lines.,123,,
779,0.97,5371.566,5381.776,That work is included in standing up the communication center that houses our 911 dispatch system.,123,,
780,0.97,5381.776,5386.814,Our working group is doing a site visit later to talk to Dispatchers to inform the decisions that come in front of the Council.,123,,
781,0.97,5386.814,5396.424,"It is also informed by the existing emergency response options, including health one for medical response.",123,,
782,0.97,5396.424,5398.426,That pairs a firefighter or Emt with the case manager.,123,,
783,0.97,5398.426,5405.133,The crisis response unit that Pares an advisor with a mental health professional.,123,,
784,0.97,5405.133,5410.037,"And secondary behavioral response programs, like the emergency services patrol and King County mobile crisis team.",123,,
785,0.97,5410.037,5416.711,So I will pull up the sheet and show you a few of the highlights.,123,,
786,0.97,5416.711,5423.417,Give me one moment while I put that screen up.,123,,
787,0.97,5423.417,5423.651,Great.,123,,
788,0.97,5423.651,5436.13,"So, this document starts with a conversation around partnership and recognizing that this partnership is really key to advancing new solutions.",123,,
789,0.97,5436.13,5444.705,"Working together means we will strive to avoid surprises, so to the extent possible we share policy work before public announcements.",123,,
790,0.97,5444.705,5449.844,We will cooperate to achieve our shared goals.,123,,
791,0.97,5449.844,5466.494,We recognize this is complex and evolving work and most of our public safety system is executed through Union workers and as such we will continue to partner with the labor relations policy committee to advance these projects.,123,,
792,0.97,5466.494,5469.73,There are two core goals for the work.,123,,
793,0.97,5469.73,5477.939,The first is that we develop a strategy.,123,,
794,0.97,5477.939,5484.345,A comprehensive look at the 911 response system and the goals of that system are to diversify the emergency response options.,123,,
795,0.97,5484.345,5492.119,"Two, to reduce harm and provide an equitable system of emergency response that serves vulnerable, Underserved populations.",123,,
796,0.97,5492.119,5504.498,"That we preserve first Responder capacity, where it is most needed, and we increase the city's response to priority three and four calls.",123,,
797,0.97,5504.498,5513.407,"The second goal is to develop a response in the near term that enables the city to test the solutions and learn from experience in the field, that can be implemented in 2023.",123,,
798,0.97,5513.407,5519.914,"To achieve these goals, we will produce for work products.",123,,
799,0.97,5519.914,5523.784,"Again, most of these will come to this Committee.",123,,
800,0.97,5523.784,5530.424,The first is an executive drafted policy document that outlines the framework for permanent alternative response models.,123,,
801,0.97,5530.424,5532.593,We call this the comprehensive work.,123,,
802,0.97,5532.593,5535.963,It will look at all call types and response models.,123,,
803,0.97,5535.963,5547.975,"This framework is to be completed by the end of the year, so operation and funding work can happen in 2023 and we can have no response options in the field by 2024.",123,,
804,0.97,5547.975,5556.517,The second is a policy proof proposal for the near term that can be designed and stood up in the next year.,123,,
805,0.97,5556.517,5564.125,The third--and for that we are looking for all of the major models around the country for response.,123,,
806,0.97,5564.125,5572.934,Like Denver's Star program and also taking a specific look at our local system.,123,,
807,0.97,5572.934,5581.576,The third is developing a policy proposal on special events staffing for Stadium and community events.,123,,
808,0.97,5581.576,5593.654,"We recognize this is not directly related to alternative 911 response, but we believe there are opportunities to free up scarce staffing resources, by doing so.",123,,
809,0.97,5593.654,5596.924,"So last night, the Seahawks kickoff game.",123,,
810,0.97,5596.924,5606.133,A typical game has 60 sworn police officers directing traffic and doing security alongside 20 parking enforcement officers.,123,,
811,0.97,5606.133,5620.848,"With the opening of climate pledge, Seahawks, Mariners, Sounders, as well as citywide festivals, sworn officers are working around the clock and our goal is to preserve officer hours for the work needed to do.",123,,
812,0.97,5620.848,5637.131,Finally thinking about a communication strategy that informs the public how to engage with the emergency response system as it evolves so people know who to call and what response to expect when they make the call.,123,,
813,0.97,5637.131,5646.474,"I will not walk through all the details of the rest of the document, but I would like to show that there is a Timeline laid out in broad strokes and I want to point out a couple of work products coming your way.",123,,
814,0.97,5646.474,5650.511,So the first is this comprehensive emergency response work.,123,,
815,0.97,5650.511,5655.816,That policy paper is expected at year-end.,123,,
816,0.97,5655.816,5663.157,"The first work product is the risk management demand analysis, being done by SPD.",123,,
817,0.97,5663.157,5664.358,We understand it is freshly done.,123,,
818,0.97,5664.358,5674.101,"Staff will get a briefing next weekend this committee will be briefed on at the morning of September 27, before you all break for budget.",123,,
819,0.97,5674.101,5682.009,External Stakeholder work is expected to happen in November/December.,123,,
820,0.97,5682.009,5688.315,The lead on this office will develop a more detailed Stakeholder engagement plan and will update U.S. that is developed.,123,,
821,0.97,5688.315,5698.292,"The near-term response program, we are working to have a proposal.",123,,
822,0.97,5698.292,5704.165,"Recommendation ready by October 14, so the Council can consider it during your budget process.",123,,
823,0.97,5704.165,5721.682,"I will note that in the supplemental, Councilmember Herbold and Lewis sponsored an amendment to move funding originally designated for the program that is not advancing and placed it in finance general.",123,,
824,0.97,5721.682,5727.721,That is one resource that could be considered to get a program off the ground.,123,,
825,0.97,5727.721,5734.829,"Finally, the special events staffing work group is meeting and hopes to have a proposal for analysis later this year.",123,,
826,0.97,5734.829,5740.101,Those are my high-level updates Úon the partnership.,123,,
827,0.97,5740.101,5743.904,"I will hand it back to you, Madam chair, and I am available to answer questions.",123,,
828,0.97,5743.904,5746.54,"Thank you, Esther.",124,,
829,0.97,5746.54,5768.529,"So, I appreciate as we are entering into the budget process, it appears that we are leaving this collaboration with the executive in such a way that recommendations coming forward can be realized for 2023 in the budget process.",124,,
830,0.97,5768.529,5770.531,Is that more or less the case?,124,,
831,0.97,5770.531,5771.632,That's correct.,125,,
832,0.97,5771.632,5778.839,We are committed to having at least one program ready to assign funding that could be operational in 2023.,125,,
833,0.97,5778.839,5781.375,Thank you.,126,,
834,0.97,5781.375,5787.014,Just looking for questions from my colleagues.,126,,
835,0.97,5787.014,5787.648,Councilmember Mosqueda.,126,,
836,0.97,5787.648,5789.917,"Thank you very much, Madam chair.",127,,
837,0.97,5789.917,5801.428,I want to thank you for your leadership in making sure this issue remains front Burner and front and center of our discussions and deliberations heading into the budget.,127,,
838,0.97,5801.428,5818.913,"Obviously many of the implementation strategies that we all hoped for last year and this year need to occur so we can do the Rightsizing or balancing, as we seek to create more publicly oriented public safety models.",127,,
839,0.97,5818.913,5828.289,"I wanted to also thank the Mayor's office for what appears to be a collaborative effort in this document to move forward with a joint understanding, almost a memorandum of understanding, of what will occur in the future.",127,,
840,0.97,5828.289,5829.29,I am hearing nonce.,127,,
841,0.97,5829.29,5843.504,"I was not quite sure how to read what it meant to have a term sheet, so if we kind of see this as a memorandum of understanding or memorandum of agreement between both branches, that is very helpful.",127,,
842,0.97,5843.504,5857.718,"I just wanted to ask a quick question and I am sorry to surprise central staff or the chair with this question, but have we done something similar in the past or is this really an innovative way to move forward collectively?",127,,
843,0.97,5857.718,5863.524,Recognizing there is joint interest in collaboration from the executive and legislative branch.,127,,
844,0.97,5863.524,5873.601,"Is there something new we are trying to get together to compromise a shared vision, so that we have a Timeline and accountability for the implementation actions?",127,,
845,0.97,5873.601,5884.712,"That is a great prior example that she worked with that I think you'll really like, Councilmember Mosqueda.",128,,
846,0.97,5884.712,5887.147,I think the answer is both.,129,,
847,0.97,5887.147,5891.418,Part of what we modeled this off was a project a couple of years ago.,129,,
848,0.97,5891.418,5896.357,Writing and designing legislation for backyard cottages.,129,,
849,0.97,5896.357,5902.763,"A very different subject matter, in which central staff was going to work Collaboratively with the executive.",129,,
850,0.97,5902.763,5911.138,Central staff was going to do Morel and little coal work then might be typical on an executive proposal.,129,,
851,0.97,5911.138,5922.716,"I don't remember the exact title of the document created that says here are joint goals, shared responsibilities, here is who will do what.",129,,
852,0.97,5922.716,5932.026,We have made several rounds at collaboration on this particular project and Council has been working on it for several years.,129,,
853,0.97,5932.026,5943.103,"Recognizing that this body of work requires very much implementation, operational design by the executive branch.",129,,
854,0.97,5943.103,5945.906,There is deep policy interest by the Council.,129,,
855,0.97,5945.906,5958.485,"We said, why don't we try to form a more formal partnership that has shared agreement about Deliverables and outcomes on the project.",129,,
856,0.97,5958.485,5963.29,"So, giving it a try and so far the Workgroup is making good progress and I am feeling helpful about the approach.",129,,
857,0.97,5963.29,5965.392,Great.,130,,
858,0.97,5965.392,5967.127,It is deep policy interest by the Council.,130,,
859,0.97,5967.127,5975.769,"I think it is important to underscore, it is codified in statute by the interests.",130,,
860,0.97,5975.769,5978.005,So those efforts under the previous administration did not get implemented.,130,,
861,0.97,5978.005,5990.784,Due to the lack of implementation under the previous administration and the joint interest that I think this term sheet or memorandum of understanding underscores is that there is movement now.,130,,
862,0.97,5990.784,5998.726,Again I want to thank senior deputy Mayor Harrell who I see on the line and I know has leadership over this area.,130,,
863,0.97,5998.726,6008.635,"The executive branch for this innovative effort to move forward on shared priorities, so we can all see some action.",130,,
864,0.97,6008.635,6010.437,Looking forward to movement after much delay.,130,,
865,0.97,6010.437,6011.905,Thank you.,130,,
866,0.97,6011.905,6018.178,"Senior deputy Mayor Harrell, I see you coming on screen.",131,,
867,0.97,6018.178,6020.647,Anything you wanted to add.,131,,
868,0.97,6020.647,6029.123,I wanted to add that I recognize we enter a relationship where the executive already had a prior relationship.,132,,
869,0.97,6029.123,6037.631,"Not the current executive, but where the executive and legislative branches had a prior relationship.",132,,
870,0.97,6037.631,6040.968,So you know there are a couple of things we are wanting to do here.,132,,
871,0.97,6040.968,6055.783,One of which is we have a few new folks at the table.,132,,
872,0.97,6055.783,6063.724,Ensuring we have a shared commitment and shared understanding for how we come to the table together.,132,,
873,0.97,6063.724,6068.996,Not understanding how that working relationship might have occurred before.,132,,
874,0.97,6068.996,6070.864,Making sure we have similarity in our language and values.,132,,
875,0.97,6070.864,6084.411,"It does not mean that we don't all retain the right to, you know, potentially disagree and not have 100% alignment, but we are working toward the same goals and vision.",132,,
876,0.97,6084.411,6089.917,Which I think we are doing.,132,,
877,0.97,6089.917,6094.354,"And to set ground rules for whatever shared understandings are, together.",132,,
878,0.97,6094.354,6102.095,"This term sheet, and the reason we are kind of calling it a term sheet versus an Mou.",132,,
879,0.97,6102.095,6109.103,It is because we do retain the autonomy of the positions we hold.,132,,
880,0.97,6109.103,6119.98,"We don't want to say, Council, you can't speak out about this and the executive always, again, retains the ability to say we might see things differently.",132,,
881,0.97,6119.98,6131.592,"But the fact is, we want to be able to have a collaborative environment where we work together to move things forward, because Stalemates don't help the communities I think we are all trying to serve.",132,,
882,0.97,6131.592,6138.031,That is really what we are trying to express with this kind of codification of the relationship.,132,,
883,0.97,6138.031,6151.445,"One, setting better relationship for the executive and legislative branches, regardless of who is in those positions.",132,,
884,0.97,6151.445,6160.154,Also making sure we are doing the right work to move the city forward and not getting stuck.,132,,
885,0.97,6160.154,6170.364,"You know, not getting stuck on small disagreements and holding the rest of the city back.",132,,
886,0.97,6170.364,6177.204,Hopefully it is received with that spirit and that we can continue a really positive working relationship together.,132,,
887,0.97,6177.204,6180.14,"Excellent, thank you.",133,,
888,0.97,6180.14,6180.674,Councilmember Nelson.,133,,
889,0.97,6180.674,6183.343,Thank you.,134,,
890,0.97,6183.343,6189.65,"I have questions about the separate work product numbers, so do you want me to ask them all at once?",134,,
891,0.97,6189.65,6192.119,"Go ahead, ask them all at once.",135,,
892,0.97,6192.119,6202.262,"Okay, so for work product 1, there is a call analysis that we see.",136,,
893,0.97,6202.262,6203.897,I am looking at how it is worded.,136,,
894,0.97,6203.897,6204.731,Let's see.,136,,
895,0.97,6204.731,6210.137,"Anyway, an analysis of 911 calls is going to be conducted.",136,,
896,0.97,6210.137,6215.609,"I just want to make sure, is this a new analysis?",136,,
897,0.97,6215.609,6220.914,Because we already have--is this different or will it be conducted by a body of experts?,136,,
898,0.97,6220.914,6224.017,Or can you just clarify that?,136,,
899,0.97,6224.017,6229.656,"Okay, that is one question.",136,,
900,0.97,6229.656,6249.142,"For work product to, there is going to be, in September, a report on our existing programs that we have to respond to people in crisis and we do have lead to.",136,,
901,0.97,6249.142,6256.617,"We are spending $8.6 million, which seems like a program that does exactly what we are calling for.",136,,
902,0.97,6256.617,6262.389,So hopefully that will be incorporated into this report.,136,,
903,0.97,6262.389,6279.139,"Specifically I am asking and also saying that the consideration of how 911 Dispatchers might work with lead case managers or people on the ground, I think would be good and hopefully that is incorporated.",136,,
904,0.97,6279.139,6279.439,Let's see.,136,,
905,0.97,6279.439,6304.998,"Regarding the 911 operations there, at a meeting in July, the deputy chief give a presentation on 911 operations and described the move of dispatch through SPD as not a smooth transition.",136,,
906,0.97,6304.998,6315.142,And so I am thinking that we need to make sure that we sure up this new service for this new body of work.,136,,
907,0.97,6315.142,6322.282,Since it has been moved out of SPD.,136,,
908,0.97,6322.282,6332.259,"And I hope this, what we are looking at right now, the term sheet, is not going to call for a diversion of resources to making sure that what we've got right now, it runs smoother.",136,,
909,0.97,6332.259,6333.46,"And then, let's see.",136,,
910,0.97,6333.46,6358.051,"Finally in work product for, we don't really want--if we are trying to get officers removed from responding to crisis, people experiencing behavioral health crises, et cetera, why is this item in here?",136,,
911,0.97,6358.051,6366.593,"Looking at how Sfd, I mean SPD, staff special events.",136,,
912,0.97,6366.593,6375.302,"That seems like, is that Justin here because Council is expressing interest in that?",136,,
913,0.97,6375.302,6387.481,Or is it contemplated that police were not responding to working in special events are going to be engaged in this body of work and if so doesn't that undermine the idea that officers will be doing this?,136,,
914,0.97,6387.481,6391.318,That is all of my questions.,136,,
915,0.97,6391.318,6401.495,"I am happy to walk through those and then senior deputy Mayor Harrell, if you have pieces to add, please feel free to Chime in.",137,,
916,0.97,6401.495,6405.132,Your first question was about the call analysis.,137,,
917,0.97,6405.132,6415.709,"The call analysis essentially builds on the risk management, demand analysis that SPD is doing.",137,,
918,0.97,6415.709,6422.215,"So, essentially by call type, with that additional information and the data we have to date.",137,,
919,0.97,6422.215,6430.924,We will have an opportunity to further breakdown a look at all of the various calls and specific responses that we are considering.,137,,
920,0.97,6430.924,6435.629,So it is not an external party.,137,,
921,0.97,6435.629,6456.149,"The call analysis is meant to be the deeper dive once we have the risk management demand work, to start Parsing out categories of calls against potential alternative response solutions and propose that should stay with existing responses.",137,,
922,0.97,6456.149,6470.13,"The second conversation about lead, I think this work is intending to encompass and look at how all of these programs interact with one another.",137,,
923,0.97,6470.13,6474.768,Lead is not currently directly dispatched by 911.,137,,
924,0.97,6474.768,6481.641,It is a community dispatch and referral network.,137,,
925,0.97,6481.641,6488.281,"So, a direct dispatch of L.E.A.D.",137,,
926,0.97,6488.281,6494.754,"Officers is not something we are considering, but we can consider where they fit into the fabric of community case management.",137,,
927,0.97,6494.754,6507.567,Mental behavioral health response fabric that of course shapes who is calling 911 and needing a direct response.,137,,
928,0.97,6507.567,6512.572,"Third, you asked about 911 operations.",137,,
929,0.97,6512.572,6518.712,"As I mentioned, we are visiting a dispatch center today.",137,,
930,0.97,6518.712,6534.327,The success and stability is front and center for our team and I want to say that the Mayor's office certainly has been bringing that as a top priority to the table.,137,,
931,0.97,6534.327,6546.907,"The idea with doing this in two phases, of being able to choose sort of one pilot, one program to stand up in 2023, is not adding a huge amount of complexity next year.",137,,
932,0.97,6546.907,6551.878,But starting one additional form of dispatch that can be deployed.,137,,
933,0.97,6551.878,6564.591,"The more comprehensive work, which we will have a framework for by the end of the year, we have all of next year to do operational work, budget, staffing sort of analysis.",137,,
934,0.97,6564.591,6566.259,So those will be available in 2024.,137,,
935,0.97,6566.259,6572.332,I think that is working on a Timeline that gives us time to Onboard a permanent director.,137,,
936,0.97,6572.332,6581.374,"And do the protocol work that is currently underway, I believe with an external vendor.",137,,
937,0.97,6581.374,6589.783,"So that by the time we are ready to deploy responses, that dispatch center is ready.",137,,
938,0.97,6589.783,6596.89,Then your fourth question was about the special events work.,137,,
939,0.97,6596.89,6599.559,And I think the answer to this is sort of yes and no.,137,,
940,0.97,6599.559,6612.105,"We know that with the reduced police force that we have right now, officers are working overtime on multiple fronts.",137,,
941,0.97,6612.105,6621.081,"That includes overtime on their core work, as well as an incredible number of hours staffing the special events.",137,,
942,0.97,6621.081,6629.389,"One of the goals of the overall project, you know, we are trying to do a response system.",137,,
943,0.97,6629.389,6635.295,We are also trying to increase our response time and ability to those priority three and four calls.,137,,
944,0.97,6635.295,6669.629,"We think there is an opportunity to ensure that the time our sworn officers are spending on special events is limited to only what they can and need to be doing, so that they are able, in today's current system, increase response time to priority three and four calls, as well as, you know, the sworn officer savings that may be, as we deploy alternatives.",137,,
945,0.97,6669.629,6670.23,Happy to take follow-ups.,137,,
946,0.97,6670.23,6678.138,"Senior deputy Mayor Harrell, do you have anything to add?",137,,
947,0.97,6678.138,6679.172,Thank you for covering that.,138,,
948,0.97,6679.172,6680.807,I think it covers a lot of it.,138,,
949,0.97,6680.807,6695.155,"I will say, just to put an underline under it, that the existing programs that we have, they are not eliminated from being served.",138,,
950,0.97,6695.155,6699.292,Programs like L.E.A.D.,138,,
951,0.97,6699.292,6708.635,"And others, there may be a clear utilization are slightly different utilization of those resources we had available.",138,,
952,0.97,6708.635,6711.071,We are not going to invent new things out of whole cloth.,138,,
953,0.97,6711.071,6715.175,There might be an alignment of resources that help us toward some goals.,138,,
954,0.97,6715.175,6733.827,The other thing I will add is that we know that there needs to be more support in and around Cscc and that does begin with ensuring that we have a permanent director in place.,138,,
955,0.97,6733.827,6734.227,Going forward.,138,,
956,0.97,6734.227,6742.569,So you will see us announcing a plan for the search for the permanent Cscc director.,138,,
957,0.97,6742.569,6754.314,The interim director has been extremely gracious in helping us get that Department off the ground.,138,,
958,0.97,6754.314,6765.358,"And we know that there is still a lot of work to do, but that does begin with finding their new leadership in making sure we have the right resources in place.",138,,
959,0.97,6765.358,6770.396,And I just want to add a couple of additions here.,139,,
960,0.97,6770.396,6780.14,As it relates to the analysis.,139,,
961,0.97,6780.14,6790.483,"Councilmember Nelson, I heard you ask about how it relates to the Nick Jr. report.",139,,
962,0.97,6790.483,6793.753,It only looked at how calls were classified as they came in.,139,,
963,0.97,6793.753,6813.439,"The Rmd analysis will look at how they were closed out, so they can determine whether or not there is any risk associated with how we might think a call will present itself and the risk that a person going out to engage in that call.",139,,
964,0.97,6813.439,6822.382,So I think that is an important bit of texture for why this analysis will be helpful.,139,,
965,0.97,6822.382,6843.236,"I also want to sort of make a brighter distinction between the comprehensive work, as director Andy Referenced, which the outcomes for that more comprehensive work might take more time, as opposed to this particular pilot program.",139,,
966,0.97,6843.236,6870.063,"The executive, SPD in particular, has been really helpful in level setting the work product of the Rmd and I just want to take this opportunity to address their concerns that many in the city believe the analysis will result in a list of discrete calls that they will then work to divert.",139,,
967,0.97,6870.063,6875.168,That is not the nature of the product.,139,,
968,0.97,6875.168,6886.946,"Instead, this comprehensive work as opposed to the pilot effort we are talking about now, will receive a staffing model and risk analysis.",139,,
969,0.97,6886.946,6888.348,For all of the different call types.,139,,
970,0.97,6888.348,6903.229,"This will project the risks associated with call types, based on a perfect understanding of the outcome of prior calls, in order to predict the staffing needs to provide a diversified response across different call types.",139,,
971,0.97,6903.229,6909.769,"So what we are doing, what we are talking about now, my result in diverting call types.",139,,
972,0.97,6909.769,6915.408,In the past we have talked about person down and wellness checks.,139,,
973,0.97,6915.408,6928.588,"We will see what this analysis results in, but the analysis is intended to allow for the possibility of a diversified response across a number of call types.",139,,
974,0.97,6928.588,6933.293,Some of those calls might be diverted and some of them might not.,139,,
975,0.97,6933.293,6940.199,"So I just want to clarify that for the viewing public, because it can be confusing.",139,,
976,0.97,6940.199,6943.436,For myself as well.,139,,
977,0.97,6943.436,6944.237,That really helped.,140,,
978,0.97,6944.237,6951.11,"I know a lot of people say, how do we know what kind of calls they will be going into, so thank you very much.",140,,
979,0.97,6951.11,6952.578,Absolutely.,141,,
980,0.97,6952.578,6976.936,"The other point I wanted to make as it relates to the challenges of the Cscc, I just want to acknowledge that many of the challenges we have heard about, as it relates to call response time, the Nonemergency line not always being answered, is at its foundation, a staffing issue.",141,,
981,0.97,6976.936,6986.279,Much like our first responders and police Department and the fire Department.,141,,
982,0.97,6986.279,6992.485,We added funding beyond what was proposed in the budget last year.,141,,
983,0.97,6992.485,7009.669,"They are working on hiring and we are seeing a great improvement in call response time, as well as fewer periods of time where the Nonemergency line is being answered.",141,,
984,0.97,7009.669,7011.27,That is really important.,141,,
985,0.97,7011.27,7034.827,I also want to flag that they are diligently working to develop and implement the protocol system that will allow 911 call takers to do this diversified response that the Council funded in last year's budget.,141,,
986,0.97,7034.827,7046.239,"Even though we are not everywhere that maybe we want O be at this time in the year, there is a lot of Behind-The- scenes work that is necessary.",141,,
987,0.97,7046.239,7053.98,That has been happening on a parallel track to the development of the collaboration with the Mayor.,141,,
988,0.97,7053.98,7060.153,So I just want to acknowledge that really important and necessary Behind-The-Scenes work.,141,,
989,0.97,7060.153,7068.528,Looking to see if there are other questions or comments from Councilmembers.,141,,
990,0.97,7068.528,7074.067,Not seeing any.,141,,
991,0.97,7074.067,7089.415,"Again, I appreciate this important work that Council central staff are working on, as a team, with the executive staff.",141,,

993,0.97,7103.095,7107.967,I am really encouraged by this progress.,141,,

995,0.97,7118.511,7124.217,"That is the date the budget is announced, but since we meet in the morning we are allowed to have our last meeting of the fall.",141,,
996,0.97,7124.217,7134.56,"So if any committee members anticipate being absent from that meeting, I appreciate being notified.",141,,
997,0.97,7134.56,7145.738,I think we did a survey of community members between the state--this date and an alternative date.,141,,
998,0.97,7145.738,7147.206,"If anything changes, please let me know.",141,,
999,0.97,7147.206,7152.445,"Before we adjourn, are there any other comments from my colleagues?",141,,
