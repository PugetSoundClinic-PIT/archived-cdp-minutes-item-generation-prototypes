17,0.97,59.592,63.43,Thank you so much.,12,,
18,0.97,63.43,70.837,"On today's agenda, we will be hearing the office of police accountability's 2020 annual report, hearing from Andrew Myerberg and Anne Bettesworth.",12,,
19,0.97,70.837,86.553,Just want to start with some chair's remarks on the one-year anniversary of the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers.,12,,
20,0.97,86.553,116.382,"Reflecting on this day, I came across a column written by K Cummings on the Seattle times risk of the pendulum of support for the black lives matter movement leaning toward the status quo based on the history of that occurring when past generations have called for justice from lack Americans.",12,,
21,0.97,116.382,122.622,"Cummings said ""like freedom, selfishness is a foundation stone of the American experience.",12,,
22,0.97,122.622,135.134,Our history is one long pattern of certain people satisfying their selfish needs at the expense of a selected few beginning with the indigenous peoples and the exploitation of enslaved Africans.,12,,
23,0.97,135.134,150.416,"We quickly learned racial justice in America arrives and recedes like a pendulum toward justice for a time and then back again towards Selfishnes.""",12,,
24,0.97,150.416,159.659,Last summer we asked the court to maintain a consent decree in the face of police response and mostly peaceful protests.,13,,
25,0.97,159.659,188.955,"Now we are faced with a consent decree that is a barrier to passage of policy, regulating the use of weapons like blast balls and tear gas and a consent decree that is a barrier as well to the Council for billing our commitment to reduce the police Department's budget and to hold them accountable for unauthorized overtime spending beyond the budget granted by the Council and using those funds for other pressing needs.",13,,
26,0.97,188.955,193.76,Just a few words about the blanket bill because we did not hear it in full counsel today.,13,,
27,0.97,193.76,205.972,The budget bill may be one such example of that swing of the pendulum.,13,,
28,0.97,205.972,215.615,And the risk of our efforts to work to increase funding for alternatives to policing and increase the number of things that we asked the police Department to do.,13,,
29,0.97,215.615,227.327,The bill that we have discussed in committee has been intended to be a compromise that sticks to our commitment to hold SPD accountable for excessive overtime spending to police protests.,13,,
30,0.97,227.327,240.607,It includes $3 million in reduction in SPD spending and it is opposed by some on the Council because it is not the full 5.4 million and opposed by others because it is any cut at all.,13,,
31,0.97,240.607,245.545,This despite the fact that SPD will have 13 million in salary savings available in the 2021 budget.,13,,
32,0.97,245.545,257.957,"To me, this is an example of a way to find ways to Reallocate funds from the SPD budget toward other public safety investments.",13,,
33,0.97,257.957,267.8,And I worry that it signals Úthat the pendulum is swinging back to the status quo and away from the unity that the Council has had over the last year on our efforts.,13,,
34,0.97,267.8,284.584,"Another example, yesterday was the temporary, hopefully, unraveling of the Council's unified position from the fall on moving the SPD parking enforcement officers into the new community safety and communication center.",13,,
35,0.97,284.584,297.964,In support of the Peo100 worker workforce vision of community safety and mostly in response to lobbying.,13,,
36,0.97,297.964,312.612,We also were asked last summer to withdrawal the city's lawsuit posing King County's new inquest process and the city was engaged in opposing new process.,13,,
37,0.97,312.612,318.818,And today we are waiting for answers.,13,,
38,0.97,318.818,340.139,We want to recognize our accomplishment over the last year and be allocated $30 million from the budgeting process and inform future policy making and making investments to build community safety.,13,,
39,0.97,340.139,347.013,"We invested $4 million to launch the Seattle community safety initiative with three community safety hubs and Wraparound services in the central district, South East and West Seattle.",13,,
40,0.97,347.013,364.163,We have invested 12 million to build the capacity of Community- based organizations working to build safety from the ground up in our neighborhoods including violence--ending violence and reducing crime.,13,,
41,0.97,364.163,367.433,We move the advocacy team for crisis response to the human services Department.,13,,
42,0.97,367.433,380.88,We have restored a million dollars to the office of civil rights for grants for organizations fulfilling alternatives to or addressing harm created by the criminal legal system.,13,,
43,0.97,380.88,384.984,We have talked to mental health professionals on the SPD response in the Department.,13,,
44,0.97,384.984,391.09,And respond to health crises.,13,,
45,0.97,391.09,408.408,We also invested in million door dollars to expand neighborhood based teams of medical health and substance abuse and professionals to respond to individuals expensing chronic or behavioral issues and people experiencing unsheltered homelessness and we have funded a restorative justice pilot program in the Seattle public schools.,13,,
46,0.97,408.408,425.224,We passed the youth rights ordinance named after a teenager who in 2017 was shot and killed by plain clothing deputies during a misguided sting operation that were only targeted two teenagers.,13,,
47,0.97,425.224,433.332,We added a crisis counselor to the Seattle fire Department and increased interactions with people in crisis.,13,,
48,0.97,433.332,449.615,We were requiring with the new law that Seattle police officers give badges and badge numbers . We have expanded health one to create three new response teams.,13,,
49,0.97,449.615,455.354,"Two of them knew, for firefighters and police officers to respond to more 911 calls.",13,,
50,0.97,455.354,474.273,The Council created community safety and medication center which just yesterday . It was a big step forward in Recalibrating our efforts to not require sworn officers to respond.,13,,
51,0.97,474.273,480.58,We reached an agreement for the first time in the police Commission to have a formal role in police Union contract negotiations.,13,,
52,0.97,480.58,495.761,"And we reduced our reliance on Incarceration by redirecting $8 million from this year and next in the King County jail contract, community based and health program to promote upstream safety and health.",13,,
53,0.97,495.761,507.106,We removed outdated drug laws from the Seattle municipal code recommended by the Reentry Workgroup.,13,,
54,0.97,507.106,514.28,"And in addition, a number of Council members advocated at the state Legislature for changes at the state law in pursuit of greater accountability measures.",13,,
55,0.97,514.28,540.139,The Council took these votes that were made possible by the voices and sustained action of thousands of protesters that made it clear that day after day in the middle of the pandemic no less that community safety cannot be achieved with the restructuring of our response crisis calls and Non- police alternatives to people in crisis.,14,,
56,0.97,540.139,541.541,You flung the city's pendulum toward justice.,14,,
57,0.97,541.541,546.445,"And when I say you, I mean everyone in Healthcare who has been doing this work.",14,,
58,0.97,546.445,550.75,I know these changes are your effort and this work is not done.,14,,
59,0.97,550.75,567.066,"Closing, I just want to say before we move to public comment, that it is appropriate that on this day we hear from our office of police accountability about their work over the past year.",14,,
60,0.97,567.066,570.703,And Andrew Myerberg says changes are needed to keep improving the systems both locally and statewide.,14,,
61,0.97,570.703,584.984,"Hearing his report, together with the recommendations of the office of the inspector general and the community police Commission, it is all part of improving an imperfect system of accountability.",14,,
62,0.97,584.984,598.497,We want to honor the life of George Lloyd this morning and also recognize the depths Derek Hayden and others at the hands of Seattle police officers over the last year.,14,,
63,0.97,598.497,599.332,I want to take a pause.,14,,
64,0.97,599.332,617.917,"I have received (Indiscernible) and receiving some opening remarks, counsel callings if you folks have points that you would like to add.",14,,
65,0.97,617.917,619.418,You are certainly encouraged to do so.,14,,
66,0.97,619.418,621.354,"Otherwise, I will move into approval.",14,,
67,0.97,621.354,621.821,Councilmember Sawant.,14,,
68,0.97,621.821,627.994,Thank you chair Herbold.,15,,
69,0.97,627.994,638.738,I appreciate the chance to make some opening remarks and not interrupt the presentation at different times.,15,,
70,0.97,638.738,649.749,And because my questions are more Overarching on specific slide items.,15,,
71,0.97,649.749,651.884,I would like to quickly Frontload those questions as well.,15,,
72,0.97,651.884,679.745,"As I'm sure everyone who is watching would know, my office is completely convinced that the Seattle police accountability system, as we have it, is fundamentally broken on a structural level and as far as any individual decision made in the office of police accountability, although I have a substantial disagreement with those decisions.",15,,
73,0.97,679.745,714.98,"The point is that the Overarching context, and I want to be crystal clear about the Overarching context because otherwise the points that come from the office, and some of them I lay out right now, but why the police were not held accountable for the mass brutality of the black lives matter movement last summer will be lost in second- degree details Unfortunately, this has happened repeatedly from Presenters where the Overarching context of the failure and police accountability is not kept in context.",15,,
74,0.97,714.98,729.595,We need elected oversight board with full powers over the police de to--to higher--hire and fire police officers and carry out investigations.,15,,
75,0.97,729.595,736.235,Director Andrew Myerberg and others are not sworn officers.,15,,
76,0.97,736.235,745.044,They are not independent of the Mayor and the overall political establishment.,15,,
77,0.97,745.044,748.948,It is not just about the individual police officers.,15,,
78,0.97,748.948,753.486,All of those are crucial components.,15,,
79,0.97,753.486,766.165,But this is not in the vacuum of the overall establishment that has failed in its task on police accountability.,15,,
80,0.97,766.165,781.08,"The Mayor ordered the police to guess the people of Seattle last summer, in addition to using other weaponry, so-called less lethal weapons, on peaceful protesters repeatedly night after night.",15,,
81,0.97,781.08,787.019,So how can they be excited to hold the police accountable after that overwhelming police violence.,15,,
82,0.97,787.019,803.269,"And the police contract that I was Unfortunately the only representative on the Council to vote against, effectively creates a 180 statute of limitations on police being held accountable.",16,,
83,0.97,803.269,810.609,Does that mean all of the investigations into the police violence are effectively over?,16,,
84,0.97,810.609,820.419,You did not sustain the thousands of complaints against the officers--against the officer that pepper sprayed a child in the face.,16,,
85,0.97,820.419,822.221,How can you justify that?,16,,
86,0.97,822.221,826.592,I have asked this question in the committee before and have not had any kind of satisfactory answers.,16,,
87,0.97,826.592,835.234,The response has been that it is regrettable but consistent with these procedures.,16,,
88,0.97,835.234,839.004,This is a response we have had from director Andrew Myerberg and others.,16,,
89,0.97,839.004,846.245,We respond when our office vote for legislation putting a ban on the police from using these chemical weapons against protesters.,16,,
90,0.97,846.245,847.947,You opposed to that.,16,,
91,0.97,847.947,853.419,So you say it is regrettable but it is simply not credible when you oppose every effort to stop it.,16,,
92,0.97,853.419,860.025,You exonerate the police officer saying that the officer acted within the law and then you opposed changing the law.,16,,
93,0.97,860.025,867.166,Why do you think the police are so confident that they can Brutalize black lives matter protesters without consequence?,16,,
94,0.97,867.166,874.173,Do you think the Seattle police were generally held accountable for the violence they unleashed on our community during the black lives matter movement last summer?,16,,
95,0.97,874.173,874.974,These are my questions.,16,,
96,0.97,874.974,885.05,I hope that today will be different and we will have different answers and on this statute of limitations.,16,,
97,0.97,885.05,897.663,"Unfortunately, I'm not very hopeful but I did want to register those questions because I think it is extremely important for us as elected representatives to continue pushing on things, even though we have not had results yet.",16,,
98,0.97,897.663,901.1,Thank you so much.,16,,
99,0.97,901.1,910.075,"Thank you Councilmember Sawant . seeing no other hands, I will move to approval of the agenda.",17,,
100,0.97,910.075,916.482,The agenda will be adopted.,17,,

123,0.97,1029.828,1036.835,"Today, the OPA director Andrew Myerberg will go behind and blind us and harden our hearts with numbers and lies.",18,,
124,0.97,1036.835,1046.645,"This will be done by a man who spent his entire professional career, 13 years, defending police including defending the New York City police against illegal and righteous claims of the central park five.",18,,
125,0.97,1046.645,1050.649,You are the only numbers that matter today.,18,,

128,0.97,1054.053,1065.33,Those are the days that Terry Cavers murder went unnoticed with Andrew Myerberg claiming there were no complaints by OPA despite the fact that I did make a complaint.,18,,
129,0.97,1065.33,1069.868,371 for the days that we are still waiting for the OPA report on the SPD murder of Terry Cavers.,18,,
130,0.97,1069.868,1076.775,27 for the number of people killed by a speedy in the first decade of the century before John Williams.,18,,
131,0.97,1076.775,1083.749,29 for the number of people killed by a speedy in the last decade after John Williams and the start of the police reform process.,18,,
132,0.97,1083.749,1085.284,"By the way, 29 is bigger than 27.",18,,
133,0.97,1085.284,1092.124,All these killings are ruled lawful and proper were never investigated or they are still Waitng for the investigation to be completed.,18,,
134,0.97,1092.124,1103.001,One is a number of SP officers with anything more than a Reprimand for all of the abuse and harm unleashed on hundreds over the last 12 months.,18,,
135,0.97,1103.001,1109.107,Two is a number of days suspension with or without pay.,18,,

137,0.97,1112.111,1116.415,Nine is the number of years we have pretended to have police Acountability.,18,,

164,0.97,1262.928,1268.533,I would like to talk to you about my own expense with Psychedelics and how they relate to broader studies of Psychedelics across the country.,24,,
165,0.97,1268.533,1274.139,My first time taking it was over a decade ago.,24,,
166,0.97,1274.139,1277.743,Experience mostly a sense of peace is with myself and the world.,24,,
167,0.97,1277.743,1283.448,I came out of the trip with a confidence in myself that made me a genuinely happier person.,24,,
168,0.97,1283.448,1290.055,"There have been multiple studies that have shown that over 66% of patients receiving Psychedelic treatment, regard the session is the most spiritual expanse of their lives.",24,,
169,0.97,1290.055,1298.797,You have heard from me and other volunteers that these have healed anxiety.,24,,
170,0.97,1298.797,1304.169,"My question to you, city hall, is why would we want to continue Incarcerating people for continuing to better themselves.",24,,
171,0.97,1304.169,1308.44,Like it looks have shown to have incredible medical benefits.,24,,
172,0.97,1308.44,1310.308,Would any of you say the same about alcohol or tobacco?,24,,
173,0.97,1310.308,1321.687,I'm asking you to take a look at the facts and testimonials we have given before you and ask yourselves how keeping these substances Criminalized benefits anyone.,24,,
174,0.97,1321.687,1329.828,We cannot let Seattle get left behind practicing archaic drug laws that have proven to not work.,24,,
175,0.97,1329.828,1333.932,It is an equitable and safe access just like so many cities have done before us.,24,,
176,0.97,1333.932,1334.933,"We can do better, Seattle.",24,,
177,0.97,1334.933,1335.634,Support our resolution.,24,,
178,0.97,1335.634,1342.541,I yield my time.,24,,

180,0.97,1350.615,1351.049,Hello.,26,,
181,0.97,1351.049,1356.855,Can you hear me?,26,,
182,0.97,1356.855,1366.365,Calling regarding counsel bill one 1981 which gives money to a speedy that should go to Participatory budgeting.,26,,
183,0.97,1366.365,1369.468,After you committed to defending last summer.,26,,
184,0.97,1369.468,1372.337,I urge Council to reject the bill and follow through with Defunding a speedy.,26,,
185,0.97,1372.337,1374.039,Today marks one year since murder of George Floyd.,26,,
186,0.97,1374.039,1382.147,The was police have killed at least 1060 people ever since.,26,,
187,0.97,1382.147,1388.186,414 just in 2021 including Seattle police who killed both Gregory Taylor and Derek Hayden in the span of a single week.,26,,
188,0.97,1388.186,1389.855,Police do not make us safer.,26,,
189,0.97,1389.855,1391.39,Spd does not need more money.,26,,
190,0.97,1391.39,1403.301,The OPA findings can be Overruled by the police chief and the consent decree claims to be an oversight body but it has been used to evade the Teargas ban last summer and delay this bill for months.,26,,
191,0.97,1403.301,1405.504,Black lives matter is directly putting danger into this bill.,26,,
192,0.97,1405.504,1409.407,The conviction of Derek Chauvin s not justice.,26,,
193,0.97,1409.407,1417.249,It is one rare form of police accountability that was achieved through immense pressure.,26,,
194,0.97,1417.249,1425.423,Seattle city Council has power over the SPD budget and must use it to intervene and the continued killing and Brutalization of your constituents.,26,,
195,0.97,1425.423,1429.728,Honor George Floyd and consider the commitments to the black lives you have made or broken in the years since his murder.,26,,
196,0.97,1429.728,1438.003,It has been one year and the demands of the protest have not been met.,26,,
197,0.97,1438.003,1440.272,We want to Defund SP by 50% at least.,26,,
198,0.97,1440.272,1441.54,Reallocate the funds to by committees.,26,,
199,0.97,1441.54,1445.21,Release all protesters without charges.,26,,
200,0.97,1445.21,1446.211,For no new you still.,26,,

202,0.97,1448.346,1458.79,Please reject the counsel bill bill when it goes to full counsel . I yield my time.,26,,
203,0.97,1458.79,1459.891,Valerie Florez.,27,,
204,0.97,1459.891,1464.029,Good morning.,28,,
205,0.97,1464.029,1468.033,I live in beacon Hill.,28,,
206,0.97,1468.033,1477.576,On today's agenda is the presentation of the OPA's annual report.,28,,
207,0.97,1477.576,1479.578,I have read it.,28,,
208,0.97,1479.578,1484.716,It reveals the Pro- police bias baked into the Star current system police accountability.,28,,
209,0.97,1484.716,1499.197,"There are multiple points where the report language Associates protest after the murder of George Floyd with complaints to the OPA, as if protest was the cause of complaint.",28,,
210,0.97,1499.197,1499.898,Let's be clear.,28,,
211,0.97,1499.898,1503.301,Protest is the exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of speech.,28,,
212,0.97,1503.301,1514.479,"It is possible to have protest without the police response of escalation, retaliation and a--an attack on civilians that we saw last summer.",28,,
213,0.97,1514.479,1515.847,Those actions by SPD were clearly unnecessary.,28,,
214,0.97,1515.847,1520.719,That was documented in many videos.,28,,
215,0.97,1520.719,1525.991,Protests are not a reason for people filing complaints to the OPA.,28,,
216,0.97,1525.991,1531.796,The abusive behavior of SPD and response to protest is the reason for the complaint.,28,,
217,0.97,1531.796,1538.036,How SPD handles protests and how it polices it at other times are obviously related.,28,,
218,0.97,1538.036,1540.538,The problems with policing in our city take a high toll year after year.,28,,
219,0.97,1540.538,1551.549,That is an ongoing problem that is obscured in the annual report that the OPA is presenting today.,28,,
220,0.97,1551.549,1554.486,The report gives some Metrics without giving real information about complaints or consequences.,28,,
221,0.97,1554.486,1561.159,"At several points, the OPA says it increases (Indiscernible) this year in response to public interest.",28,,
222,0.97,1561.159,1562.36,My jaw dropped when I read that.,28,,
223,0.97,1562.36,1571.169,What we have gotten from the OPA is not real transparency but a higher profile in response to a season of crisis and criticism.,28,,
224,0.97,1571.169,1574.372,Let's not pretend we have real transparency or real police accountability.,28,,
225,0.97,1574.372,1583.181,We need to start over with a fully civilian police oversight board that is elected by the people and accountable to them.,28,,
226,0.97,1583.181,1589.888,Go to Seattlestop.Org for more information.,28,,

234,0.97,1617.582,1625.991,"During that time, I have served thousands of people, particularly around substance use disorder.",32,,
235,0.97,1625.991,1636.134,"Of the thousands of people I worked with, exactly one of those people had a primary diagnosis of Psychedelic related substance use disorder.",32,,
236,0.97,1636.134,1646.745,I'm speaking in favor of the effort to Decriminalize nature and Decriminalize substances in the city of Seattle.,32,,
237,0.97,1646.745,1653.351,"While look in my anecdotal experience, I have had a minimal amount of problems related to these substances.",32,,
238,0.97,1653.351,1668.466,"And when we look at the literature on the topic, the substances have incredibly low profile for abuse or dependence and, when used responsibly, a really good safety record.",32,,
239,0.97,1668.466,1716.614,"That coupled with the research on the medical efficacy of the substance, Furthermore we look at the facts that many spiritual traditions have a profound effect on their participants or the people in their conversation at reducing addiction and mental health disorders as well as the native American . You can see that clearly the harm done by these substances when balanced against the very likely benefit to individuals in the community as a whole, it makes no sense to keep the substances Criminalized.",32,,
240,0.97,1716.614,1732.397,I'm not just speaking about the medical use of these substances but particularly about their spiritual use in the studies have found the spiritual use and the use of these substances --,32,,

250,0.97,1788.086,1797.295,I'm taking time away from my day to use my voice here at City Council and advocacy of Decriminalize Seattle and what they will calm with your help.,34,,
251,0.97,1797.295,1805.47,We all know the war on drugs is an incompetent or marginalized community.,34,,
252,0.97,1805.47,1811.075,Determination is a gather grow philosophy.,34,,
253,0.97,1811.075,1814.913,We all can agree that the government shouldn't tell anyone what they can or can't grow.,34,,
254,0.97,1814.913,1817.115,Psychedelics have helped me in more ways then I can ever imagine.,34,,
255,0.97,1817.115,1821.219,And I want that for everybody.,34,,
256,0.97,1821.219,1823.821,"As research continues, the therapeutic benefits become more and more obvious.",34,,
257,0.97,1823.821,1832.597,The therapist you will hear from will agree.,34,,
258,0.97,1832.597,1842.307,"Unfortunately, if it was not for this movement, I would have never spoken with or could I afford to speak with these brilliant minds.",34,,
259,0.97,1842.307,1850.348,"Retirement, providing for a family and space travel are all legal but they all seem equally as unobtainable to me and many of my peers.",34,,
260,0.97,1850.348,1853.017,We see how this is working out in Oregon.,34,,
261,0.97,1853.017,1857.956,Keeping this in a strictly medical realm will Snuff regular Hard-Working people like me from all the benefits associated with Psychedelics.,34,,
262,0.97,1857.956,1862.961,Discontinuing a vicious cycle.,34,,
263,0.97,1862.961,1864.529,Bondage of consciousness is not a good look.,34,,
264,0.97,1864.529,1879.077,"As far as Psychedelics go, I agree with (Indiscernible) and I give my time.",34,,
265,0.97,1879.077,1882.68,I see the last Republic Commenters are showing is not present.,35,,
266,0.97,1882.68,1884.716,"With that, we will conclude public comment.",35,,

294,0.97,2024.322,2040.805,"And I think the Councilmember does the points Councilmember Sawant makes, I'm happy to answer any questions that you feel are necessary to answer.",41,,
295,0.97,2040.805,2063.061,"I think what we will talk about today is that we worked incredibly hard and it our best with a very difficult year to try to move our system forward, whether through our investigations, their policy recommendations to try to modify and alter management policies or work with the legislative session through the spring and into the summer.",41,,
296,0.97,2063.061,2073.07,"But today, what we want to do is talk about the whole of our work product and answer whatever questions we can.",41,,

299,0.97,2085.083,2095.526,That would be ideal if you could do that.,43,,
300,0.97,2095.526,2096.094,I'm sorry.,44,,
301,0.97,2096.094,2101.532,I thought Council was showing the presentation?,44,,
302,0.97,2101.532,2108.606,But we can pull it up here if we need to.,44,,
303,0.97,2108.606,2108.806,Alex.,44,,
304,0.97,2108.806,2109.807,That would be great.,45,,
305,0.97,2109.807,2111.476,Usually the folks presenting sort of run the show.,45,,
306,0.97,2111.476,2117.081,Because you know the cadence of the presentation.,45,,
307,0.97,2117.081,2118.382,My Apologiesif we did not make that clear.,45,,
308,0.97,2118.382,2121.452,That was not clear.,46,,
309,0.97,2121.452,2122.253,"Lauren, can you pull that up?",47,,
310,0.97,2122.253,2124.889,Do you mind doing it?,48,,
311,0.97,2124.889,2129.727,I'm looking for it.,49,,
312,0.97,2129.727,2145.51,It is attached to our agenda.,50,,
313,0.97,2154.318,2164.662,"Okay, one moment.",51,,
314,0.97,2167.131,2170.368,Is that showing on the screen?,51,,
315,0.97,2170.368,2173.504,It is not.,52,,
316,0.97,2173.504,2178.643,Okay.,53,,
317,0.97,2178.643,2179.677,One moment.,53,,
318,0.97,2179.677,2188.786,"While we load this up, I will give a quick overview of where we are.",54,,
319,0.97,2188.786,2189.153,Thank you.,55,,
320,0.97,2189.153,2206.804,So we have been giving periodic updates at the CDC and labeling where we are right now.,56,,
321,0.97,2206.804,2208.506,We have interviewed all six of the involved officers.,56,,
322,0.97,2208.506,2222.82,"After the interviews occurred, we went to the supervisors and to Washington D.C. to do further analysis and investigation . We are trying to pull records.",56,,
323,0.97,2222.82,2229.427,"For example, hotel records and video and other evidence that would be relevant to the case.",56,,
324,0.97,2229.427,2238.169,We are now in the process of Re- interviewing at least five of the six or potentially all six officers prior to issuing the findings.,56,,
325,0.97,2238.169,2242.306,Right now the findings are due in early July.,56,,
326,0.97,2242.306,2249.914,And we are on target to getting that done.,56,,
327,0.97,2249.914,2279.644,And I think it might be a good Segue to address the issue that Councilmember Sawant raised about how your office deals with the Timelines when the investigation is butting up against the 180 days and sort of the track record at getting those Timelines extended as needed.,57,,
328,0.97,2279.644,2283.147,I'm not sure I totally understand the initial question.,58,,
329,0.97,2283.147,2294.258,I'm not sure--so a Six- month disciplinary Timeline.,58,,
330,0.97,2294.258,2295.459,Unless there are some unique facts.,58,,
331,0.97,2295.459,2296.994,If we don't know the officer's name.,58,,
332,0.97,2296.994,2308.739,Obviously there are no Timelines and it only starts moving for a member of the bargaining unit and if an officer is an unidentified member of a bargaining unit.,58,,
333,0.97,2308.739,2318.115,"Unless we seek an extension for example, if someone is on leave, or the case is pending investigation, all cases have to be done within six months.",58,,
334,0.97,2318.115,2327.124,"With regard to the protest cases, we will move into the report.",58,,
335,0.97,2327.124,2332.229,"We had about 145 cases roughly that stemmed from 19,000 complaints.",58,,
336,0.97,2332.229,2335.399,These complaints came in.,58,,
337,0.97,2335.399,2345.209,A lot of them came in the very beginning of the protest but they lasted through the fall and into the spring.,58,,
338,0.97,2345.209,2346.444,We periodically still get demonstration cases.,58,,
339,0.97,2346.444,2351.515,"But usually they are one offs as opposed to five, six, seven or eight from one day.",58,,
340,0.97,2351.515,2357.455,Each of the cases is governed by a 180 daytime Lane.,58,,
341,0.97,2357.455,2367.732,"In regards to the ones that are already occurred where the named employee was known, unless there was some Tolling, those cases are completed.",58,,
342,0.97,2367.732,2370.768,So findings have been issued and the Timeline is completed.,58,,
343,0.97,2370.768,2372.236,And so the cases are not outstanding.,58,,
344,0.97,2372.236,2383.28,I'm not exactly sure what the question was.,58,,
345,0.97,2383.28,2391.522,"But anything that is still pending the 180 day Timeline is still an open investigation and we expect with 99% of the other investigations, that all cases will be done within the Timeline.",58,,
346,0.97,2391.522,2392.456,Thank you so much.,59,,
347,0.97,2392.456,2398.195,Let's move into the presentation.,59,,
348,0.97,2398.195,2398.863,All right.,60,,
349,0.97,2398.863,2405.202,If we can go to the first slide please.,60,,
350,0.97,2405.202,2407.204,We will start with the employees that received complaints.,60,,
351,0.97,2407.204,2410.908,40% of sworn officer employees received a complaint last year.,60,,
352,0.97,2410.908,2419.416,This graph here is showing both sworn and civilian employees.,60,,
353,0.97,2419.416,2426.924,"With those two together, it is about 30% of all Seattle police Department employees received at least one complaint, which is pretty standard in 2019.",60,,
354,0.97,2426.924,2432.596,Wheels reported 30% of all SP employees received a complaint.,60,,
355,0.97,2432.596,2434.665,And the majority of them just received one complaint.,60,,
356,0.97,2434.665,2437.968,There were five officers he received seven or more complaints in 2020.,60,,
357,0.97,2437.968,2459.456,I requested that Andrew Myerberg do some analysis on the number or the percentage of officers who have voluntarily left the Department over the last year.,61,,
358,0.97,2459.456,2467.231,A percentage of those officers who also had pending complaints.,61,,
359,0.97,2467.231,2493.49,"And I believe director Myerberg, you found that anything 20% -30% of 200 or so officers, at the point of Urinalysis had momentarily left the department had received a complaint over the last--during the period of sustained protests.",61,,
360,0.97,2493.49,2502.266,"So basically, what I think the purpose of your question was, was to figure out if there is a correlation between Úofficers leaving and having complaints.",62,,
361,0.97,2502.266,2508.138,Were officers trying to leave SPD with pending complaints in order to avoid discipline?,62,,
362,0.97,2508.138,2516.981,"And what we found was that while some officers had complaints, the rate of complaints was overall lower than the remaining officers.",62,,
363,0.97,2516.981,2526.891,So I don't think that proves the .1 way or the other but it doesn't necessarily create an inference.,62,,
364,0.97,2526.891,2527.491,Correct.,63,,
365,0.97,2527.491,2529.927,But can you confirm that it was 20-30% of officers?,63,,
366,0.97,2529.927,2531.929,Yes.,64,,
367,0.97,2531.929,2544.008,And that was officers that left and it was the first 200 or so officers that left?,65,,
368,0.97,2544.008,2548.412,We had run it to the time where you made the request which I think was about a month ago.,66,,
369,0.97,2548.412,2556.353,Thank you so much.,67,,
370,0.97,2556.353,2556.72,Perfect.,68,,
371,0.97,2556.72,2563.06,"So the most common allegations received were professionalism, use of force and bias free policing.",69,,
372,0.97,2563.06,2572.369,These were the same top three we showed in recent years although slightly Reordered.,69,,
373,0.97,2572.369,2573.27,Use of force moved up.,69,,
374,0.97,2573.27,2577.474,And OPA logged at 58% increase in total allegations received.,69,,
375,0.97,2577.474,2584.648,"And if he moved to the next slide, we will get a little deeper into this.",69,,
376,0.97,2584.648,2591.588,So each of these four allegations increased significantly regarding the SPD response to the protest.,69,,
377,0.97,2591.588,2594.959,"As I mentioned, use of force increased significantly.",69,,
378,0.97,2594.959,2596.293,It was up 170% from 2019.,69,,
379,0.97,2596.293,2600.564,Also a pretty significant increase in supervisory responsibility.,69,,
380,0.97,2600.564,2610.908,That is because a lot of the responsibility in crowd management FALLS in the chain of command with supervisors and commanders.,69,,
381,0.97,2610.908,2618.816,Equipment and uniform allegations in a lot of cases related to the morning badges of the black tape covering the officer badge numbers initially.,69,,
382,0.97,2618.816,2624.989,"And then later on, mask wearing complaints also stemming from protests.",69,,
383,0.97,2624.989,2635.466,So of course De-Escalation increased and that is kind related to use of force and often analyzed together.,69,,
384,0.97,2635.466,2637.001,So questions about slides four and five.,70,,
385,0.97,2637.001,2666.43,"Wonering if you can give us some examples of professionalism complaints and then for the top three categories, do you have a sense of how many of the complaints are from the public compared to complaints from within the Department itself?",70,,
386,0.97,2666.43,2675.672,And I ask because another slide notes that 64% of the complaints were from the public during 2020 and 36% were from within SPD.,70,,
387,0.97,2675.672,2685.449,So interested to know what that looks like for the top three categories of complaints.,70,,
388,0.97,2685.449,2690.487,Are there categories that are more likely to report--to be reported by the Department?,70,,
389,0.97,2690.487,2691.188,Or by the public?,70,,
390,0.97,2691.188,2697.795,"And then Finally, supervisory responsibility complaints went up significantly.",70,,
391,0.97,2697.795,2707.971,What kind of allegations does this type of a complaint detail?,70,,
392,0.97,2707.971,2711.909,I can start with the internal versus external complaints coming from the public.,71,,
393,0.97,2711.909,2714.778,We will get to that and a couple of slides.,71,,
394,0.97,2714.778,2718.215,Generally we analyze that on a case level basis where you can have multiple allegations within a case.,71,,
395,0.97,2718.215,2727.624,And so we will talk about community member filed Complaits in a couple of slides.,71,,
396,0.97,2727.624,2728.492,"Andrew, do you have any examples?",71,,
397,0.97,2728.492,2728.892,Sure.,72,,
398,0.97,2728.892,2739.97,"What I would say about allegations--generally, a community member, even an officer is not actually defining one of these categories of allegations that we use.",72,,
399,0.97,2739.97,2746.844,"They will say,--we shouldn't have.",72,,
400,0.97,2746.844,2751.148,"We are analyzing the case and saying, that is excessive use of force and it was De- escalation and it was crowd management.",72,,
401,0.97,2751.148,2762.359,You didn't use your--privilege really . I think this is something confusing at times.,72,,
402,0.97,2762.359,2763.961,Each case includes one or more allegations.,72,,
403,0.97,2763.961,2764.661,"Generally, many more.",72,,
404,0.97,2764.661,2775.973,"Usually case has between 2-6, or 7 allegations.",72,,
405,0.97,2775.973,2790.387,So a good example of force would be either under title eight which is the general use of force policy or title 14 which governs the use of force and will be the use of 40 Millimeters glass balls.,72,,
406,0.97,2790.387,2794.091,That is much of the force we are seeing in the protest context.,72,,
407,0.97,2794.091,2803.867,We are also seeing pushes or other types of force during the course of an arrest that would fall more under the general use of force policy which is 8.200.,72,,
408,0.97,2803.867,2804.701,Thank you.,73,,
409,0.97,2804.701,2815.479,"Regardless of who defines the complaint, I am--and if it is covered later, that is fine.",73,,
410,0.97,2815.479,2842.573,"But for the top three complaints--professionalism, forced use and bias free policing, I'm interested to know what percentage of those complaints, once designated or categorized by the OPA, what percentage came from the public and with what percentage came from within the Department.",73,,
411,0.97,2842.573,2855.018,"And yes, I would love some examples of professionalism, allegations and responsibility allegations.",73,,
412,0.97,2855.018,2860.023,Lauren will cover your first question later on in a couple of slides.,74,,
413,0.97,2860.023,2866.83,"With regards to the second question, professionalism is generally--there are two ways that we look at professionalism.",74,,
414,0.97,2866.83,2873.17,"It could be the use of profanity, derogatory or contentious comments to individual.",74,,
415,0.97,2873.17,2884.448,So cases where people may be made a statement over radio or that were captured when they were assigned to protests that were deemed to be profanity or derogatory and resulted in sustained findings.,74,,
416,0.97,2884.448,2891.188,Professionalism also can be more broad and conduct that undermines public trust in the Department.,74,,
417,0.97,2891.188,2900.564,"For example,--and this is not the protest context but you have a case where you used a department Database to look up information about your neighbor.",74,,
418,0.97,2900.564,2904.368,That would be profanity or something along those lines.,74,,
419,0.97,2904.368,2907.704,But it would be conduct that is improper and it undermines trust and confidence in yourself and in the Department.,74,,
420,0.97,2907.704,2913.877,That is generally professionalism.,74,,
421,0.97,2913.877,2928.492,"Supervisory responsibility is basically supervisors in most cases making the decision to disperse crowds in the decision to authorize officers to use less lethal tools including blast balls, 40 Millimeters.",74,,
422,0.97,2928.492,2941.838,"So in the protest context, it is unlike a normal patrol interaction where an officer is making that unilateral individual decision to use force.",74,,
423,0.97,2941.838,2943.84,"Here, there is supervisory approval and authority provided to officers.",74,,
424,0.97,2943.84,2945.943,So we focus very much on the supervisors.,74,,
425,0.97,2945.943,2956.019,And I think almost everyone in the big picture involved the dispersal and involved a named employee who was a supervisor.,74,,
426,0.97,2956.019,2970.067,"And the tricky thing and this is something we have discussed with Councilmember Herbold, that we are required to interview those individuals and investigate those individuals Ith our supervisors and we only have two of them.",74,,
427,0.97,2970.067,2971.768,Certainly that was a big workload issue for us.,74,,
428,0.97,2971.768,2979.843,That is an example of a supervisory responsibility.,74,,
429,0.97,2979.843,2981.044,Thank you.,75,,
430,0.97,2981.044,2987.017,"If you can go back in two more slides to the allegations, main table.",76,,
431,0.97,2987.017,2994.257,I would say that professionalism and bias free policing often do come from community members.,76,,
432,0.97,2994.257,3007.104,"However, there is the investigation team that forwards a lot of complaints internally to OPA regarding use of force and the same can happen with bias free policing that come to OPA internally from the Department.",76,,
433,0.97,3007.104,3013.477,"While a majority come from the community, they can be forwarded Internaly.",76,,
434,0.97,3013.477,3020.851,"I think also to Piggyback on that, a lot of the internal referrals on behalf of the community member.",77,,
435,0.97,3020.851,3023.253,"So by policy, officers are required to pass on community member complaints.",77,,
436,0.97,3023.253,3027.19,So those may be classified as an SPD referral.,77,,
437,0.97,3027.19,3034.831,But it is SPD referring information provided by a community member.,77,,
438,0.97,3034.831,3037.634,And two more slides.,78,,
439,0.97,3037.634,3037.901,Perfect.,78,,
440,0.97,3037.901,3050.947,More than half of cases in 2020 were classified for investigation with 2020 being the Navy blue on the graph.,79,,
441,0.97,3050.947,3058.054,We had 432 cases that were conducting an investigation or already completed investigation received in 2020.,79,,
442,0.97,3058.054,3060.223,That is an increase from previous years.,79,,
443,0.97,3060.223,3065.962,This is generally the result of an allegation and the nature of the cases.,80,,
444,0.97,3065.962,3075.338,"We, by our manual, we are required to investigate any use of force, bias allegation.",80,,
445,0.97,3075.338,3077.374,We can't process it back to the chain of command.,80,,
446,0.97,3077.374,3088.185,This I think is a function of the increase and use of force allegations that I think we showed in the past slide.,80,,
447,0.97,3088.185,3093.39,More of the OPA investigations in 2020 stemmed from community member or external complaints.,81,,
448,0.97,3093.39,3096.493,This is what I was saying when we measure this on a case level basis.,81,,
449,0.97,3096.493,3105.368,This graph for the 2020 calendar years referring to those 432 investigations I mentioned in the last slide.,81,,
450,0.97,3105.368,3108.772,Nearly two thirds of them were filed by the public to OPA.,81,,
451,0.97,3108.772,3116.913,So that is not even including the bias complaints or other ones forwarded internally from SPD.,81,,
452,0.97,3116.913,3125.755,So the community is--so not only are investigations increasing but more of the investigations are coming from community filed complaints.,81,,
453,0.97,3125.755,3126.323,Opposed to previous years.,81,,
454,0.97,3126.323,3133.83,I want to take a moment so we can adjust this.,82,,
455,0.97,3133.83,3141.037,This chart indicates that 72% of complaints were internal in 2018.,82,,
456,0.97,3141.037,3147.978,52% of complaints were internal in 2019 and only 36 complaints were internal in 2020.,82,,
457,0.97,3147.978,3150.714,It is a little bit different.,83,,
458,0.97,3150.714,3154.317,And an important distinction is that these are just complaints classified for an investigation.,84,,
459,0.97,3154.317,3158.955,So not complaints that were contact logger went back to the supervisors for action.,84,,
460,0.97,3158.955,3159.656,Important clarification.,85,,
461,0.97,3159.656,3161.858,Thank you so much.,85,,
462,0.97,3161.858,3184.915,"So just wondering, I think the report notes that the growing number of complaints classified for investigation are from the community and in part, due to the Unsubstantiated Misconducts screening program that director Myerberg, you have initiated.",85,,
463,0.97,3184.915,3198.195,"The report says in 2020, the supervisors screen 187 allegations of misconduct with the OPA director.",85,,
464,0.97,3198.195,3202.766,Úand requested referral in 90% of cases.,85,,
465,0.97,3202.766,3211.975,The rest are investigated and documented in the field by the chain of command rather than referred to by the aye complaints.,85,,
466,0.97,3211.975,3234.598,"Want to highlight the office of the inspector general in the next quarterly audit of the OPA's determination of these incidents--we want to give you the opportunity, director Myerberg, to speak to your effort to spearhead this program and how you believe it is working.",85,,
467,0.97,3234.598,3247.744,"To your first point, I think you are correct that--backing up for second, this is the number of investigations that come from complaints.",86,,
468,0.97,3247.744,3251.281,So the number--the percentage of complaints classified for investigations.,86,,
469,0.97,3251.281,3271.134,"I will say that you are right and that the number of internal referrals that we receive, the percentage has gone down because normally, let's say it was 150 potentially, they would have come through our office and they would have been investigated.",86,,
470,0.97,3271.134,3300.096,"So the purpose of the program was to take cases--and we saw this a lot early on in 2017 and 2018, to take cases that could be clearly refuted and we had allegations where someone said, you broke my back or my legs and I can't walk and the Video shows them walking and no force was used or allegations of sexual assault that occurred in patrol videos and the in car Video shows it did not occur.",86,,
471,0.97,3300.096,3325.822,"The program purpose was to streamline the reviews of that type of misconduct and to allow supervisors to firmly disprove it, and propose how they want to handle the case with OPA and we would do our own review by looking at the Video and obviously Osu would audit it.",86,,
472,0.97,3325.822,3333.029,The program started as a pilot in 2018 and then expanded and then was approved by the court and the DOJ team and expanded over time.,86,,
473,0.97,3333.029,3356.453,"So generally, what it does is it allows OPA to focus its resources on the cases that are not easily Describable by Video and then ensures that the chain of command is taking more responsibility and then providing that information to OPA.",86,,
474,0.97,3356.453,3366.73,Thank you.,87,,
475,0.97,3369.299,3374.938,18% of cases completed in 2020 resulted in one or more sustained findings.,88,,
476,0.97,3374.938,3377.173,This presentation is about 2020 data.,88,,
477,0.97,3377.173,3382.946,There were no sustained findings returned or reversed by the chief of police last year.,88,,
478,0.97,3382.946,3407.036,"On that slide, I want to highlight that the 18% of completed investigations that were classified by OPA that contained one or more sustained findings, that is very similar to previous years and rates of sustained findings.",89,,
479,0.97,3407.036,3407.437,Is that correct?,89,,
480,0.97,3407.437,3407.771,Yes.,90,,
481,0.97,3407.771,3412.308,It generally hovers around 18- 22%.,90,,
482,0.97,3412.308,3413.409,Help me out with my mouth.,91,,
483,0.97,3413.409,3451.548,"Given that we are taking out cases that fit into the Unsubstantiated Misconducts screening program, didn't we expect--everything being equal, over a number of years, should we expect the sustained findings to--the percentage of sustained findings to go down, if we are taking out a lot of the cases where there is no basis for the complaint?",91,,
484,0.97,3451.548,3478.775,"Actually, a lot of those complaints, the tricky part about those complaints is some of those cases were handled as contact logs previously where they which is clearly so I don't know whether we have assessed that to say whether the rate would go up or down.",92,,
485,0.97,3478.775,3483.746,Certainly we--this rate has been consistent over time.,92,,
486,0.97,3483.746,3484.747,Perhaps a little bit lower.,92,,
487,0.97,3484.747,3485.615,And maybe you are right.,92,,
488,0.97,3485.615,3491.788,Maybe it does correlate with those cases.,92,,
489,0.97,3491.788,3500.463,But I don't know that we have already answered that Councilmember.,92,,
490,0.97,3500.463,3502.966,Thank you.,93,,
491,0.97,3502.966,3510.173,68 employees were disciplined following OPA investigations in 2020.,93,,
492,0.97,3510.173,3513.209,Four employees were disciplined and more than one case each.,93,,
493,0.97,3513.209,3533.363,The most common discipline--and again this is showing the most common discipline reaction is a written Reprimand followed by a suspension and then Reprimand . to the next slide.,93,,
494,0.97,3533.363,3534.931,So disciplinary appeals dropped 70% from 2019.,94,,
495,0.97,3534.931,3547.543,There were eight appeals filed in 2020. two through the public safety civil service Commission and six went through the arbitration route of appeal.,94,,
496,0.97,3547.543,3549.946,Those of the two types of Appeals that officers can do.,94,,
497,0.97,3549.946,3558.054,And OPA now has data on appeals on our Website for the public to view and Download.,94,,
498,0.97,3558.054,3566.296,It is in our case data page on our Website and we updated that of a new appeal being filed or closed.,94,,
499,0.97,3566.296,3567.63,Obviously this is a big drop.,95,,
500,0.97,3567.63,3577.373,We have ideas as to what may have caused this but not a definitive answer.,95,,
501,0.97,3577.373,3582.845,So it will be a ton of different reasons why this drop occurred.,95,,
502,0.97,3582.845,3589.585,"If you look at comparing this year, 2020, to 2019, we had more investigations and a similar sustained rate.",95,,
503,0.97,3589.585,3591.154,So more sustained cases.,95,,
504,0.97,3591.154,3593.69,So there were more sustained cases to be appealed.,95,,
505,0.97,3593.69,3594.891,But they were not appealed.,95,,
506,0.97,3594.891,3601.297,We sustained more use of force allegations in 2020 then we did in 2019.,95,,
507,0.97,3601.297,3604.867,"Generally, those are the types of allegations that are appealed by the Union.",95,,
508,0.97,3604.867,3606.502,But almost all of them are not appealed.,95,,
509,0.97,3606.502,3614.41,So it could be that the Union was more judicious about what they brought to appeal.,95,,
510,0.97,3614.41,3625.488,It could be that they felt they didn't have the grounds to appeal the decisions issued.,95,,
511,0.97,3625.488,3627.323,It is very difficult to say why this drop occurred.,95,,
512,0.97,3627.323,3631.661,But it is a very significant drop.,95,,
513,0.97,3631.661,3656.452,"And moving forward, I'm wondering if you can speak to how the resolution--of course we can't account the findings of this case for 2020 because it is relatively recent.",96,,
514,0.97,3656.452,3671.167,"But for the viewing public, a look at the potential impact of the Adlai Shepard case on appeals moving forward and how that affects the ability of the argument for appeals.",96,,
515,0.97,3671.167,3672.869,I think that would be really useful.,96,,
516,0.97,3672.869,3694.824,"I think is most people know, the Shepard case which involves the punching in the back of a patrol vehicle resulted in Mr. Sheppard's termination and an Arbitrator upheld the sustained finding but reverse the determination and opposed a disciplinary penalty but brought Mr.",97,,
517,0.97,3694.824,3719.482,"Shepherd back in the city appealed and the court agreed and then it went to a higher court and fundamental, to your question, Councilmember Herbold, is the appellate court upheld the Superior Court and said that in recognizing this for the first time, a public policy and ensuring excessive force is not used.",97,,
518,0.97,3719.482,3734.33,And I think that we view this as an incredibly significant--many of the cases pending appeal are use of force cases.,97,,
519,0.97,3734.33,3742.705,"Early on at OPA, I sustained a finding in an officer involved shooting in October of 2017 and both officers were terminated.",97,,
520,0.97,3742.705,3748.111,That case is up for appeal and we expect it will be one of the next appealed.,97,,
521,0.97,3748.111,3766.129,"I think the city is in a stronger position today, given that ruling, insofar as thinking it provides more deference to the determination of the Department that the Terminations and sustained findings were issued in furtherance of the strong public policy towards excessive force.",97,,
522,0.97,3766.129,3776.973,"Obviously, we will see how this is applied by Arbitrators moving forward.",97,,
523,0.97,3776.973,3788.05,"I think we view it as very favorable for the city, particularly in the context of excessive force cases.",97,,
524,0.97,3788.05,3792.488,I'm going to take over Non- talk about the OPA protest data and response.,98,,
525,0.97,3792.488,3807.069,"Starting in late May and throughout the rest of the year, they calculated the number of times we have been contacted about police contact and conduct.",98,,
526,0.97,3807.069,3812.308,"It is over 19,000 and probably closer to 20,000 contacts they received.",98,,
527,0.97,3812.308,3825.087,"And a lot of these were about similar incidents, about 13,000 I believe were about the child pepper spray incident.",98,,
528,0.97,3825.087,3834.096,So what we did was sort through these and determine which ones needed to be investigated and that resulted in about 145 incidents that required investigation.,98,,
529,0.97,3834.096,3837.033,So that is the number of investigations we have right now.,98,,
530,0.97,3837.033,3838.034,That is the 145 number.,98,,
531,0.97,3838.034,3850.746,"And of those, 99%--or 99 total have been completed or shown on the Website.",98,,
532,0.97,3850.746,3854.016,The remainder should be done in the next couple of months.,98,,
533,0.97,3854.016,3855.551,They all have a 180 day Timeline.,98,,
534,0.97,3855.551,3863.492,Those have been extended for a couple different circumstances including based on Covid-19 and other Timeline necessities.,98,,
535,0.97,3863.492,3870.7,"Of the 99 pieces completed, 18 contained sustained findings.",98,,
536,0.97,3870.7,3885.181,"So often there are multiple obligations within a case and so of those, 18 of the cases, there are sustained findings in them.",98,,
537,0.97,3885.181,3892.088,The also--the OPA has the ability to make systemic policy recommendations.,98,,
538,0.97,3892.088,3898.594,This is an option for director Myerberg when he feels like the individual did not commit misconduct.,98,,
539,0.97,3898.594,3902.398,It was more of a deficiency in the policy for the training being the issue.,98,,
540,0.97,3902.398,3908.17,So we made systemic policy recommendations in 12 unique cases.,98,,
541,0.97,3908.17,3918.514,"Those range from policy recommendations about blast balls, to providing medical aid . There is a range of those.",98,,
542,0.97,3918.514,3924.687,Those are all shown on the Website as well.,98,,
543,0.97,3924.687,3925.688,Councilmember Morales has a question.,99,,
544,0.97,3925.688,3928.057,Okay.,100,,
545,0.97,3928.057,3936.932,Thank you so much.,101,,
546,0.97,3936.932,3943.339,"If we can quickly come on the slide, you mentioned that of the 19,000, about 13,000 were related to that one incident with the child.",101,,
547,0.97,3943.339,3955.017,Any talk about what the other 6000 was and how this got to 145 that resulted in investigations?,101,,
548,0.97,3955.017,3957.52,There were tons of different incidents.,102,,
549,0.97,3957.52,3962.758,We sorted through and try to figure out which ones were talking about the same incidents.,102,,
550,0.97,3962.758,3963.793,And initiated investigations into those.,102,,
551,0.97,3963.793,3968.431,We go through and list every individual case on our Website.,102,,
552,0.97,3968.431,3984.38,We created a protest on the dashboard and we talked about summarizing each individual case on there and talk about the progress and where it is in the process.,102,,
553,0.97,3984.38,3998.894,"To add a little more detail, to your point, Councilmember Morales, the one we focused on when we talked about numbers was the child pepper spray case and that was 13,000.",103,,
554,0.97,3998.894,4007.203,"There were several other complaints that occurred early in the protest that did go viral, that we received a number of complaints on.",103,,
555,0.97,4007.203,4012.208,We probably could do--it is a little difficult just because of the massive amount of information.,103,,
556,0.97,4012.208,4021.617,"We could go back to the cases and give you a better idea of which complaints resulted in the most concern, or the most complaints.",103,,
557,0.97,4021.617,4024.453,But we don't necessarily have that readily available right now.,103,,
558,0.97,4024.453,4030.159,We worked really closely with Microsoft early on and they helped us go through some of the complaints.,103,,
559,0.97,4030.159,4043.239,"And so we were able to--some of them for example, contain the language and it was the same exact type of complaint.",103,,
560,0.97,4043.239,4048.744,We were able to De- Dupe and go through the different contacts again one by one by one and come up with 145 unique cases.,103,,
561,0.97,4048.744,4056.285,"Where there was a question, we deferred to creating a unique case and did not just lump things together because they were connected.",103,,
562,0.97,4056.285,4059.789,We were careful to create as many unique cases as we deemed appropriate.,103,,
563,0.97,4059.789,4066.495,Does that answer your question?,103,,
564,0.97,4066.495,4077.339,"It would be helpful to get a sense of the other complaints, or other actions that drew large numbers of complaints.",104,,
565,0.97,4077.339,4081.043,I imagine the pink umbrella case is one such case.,104,,
566,0.97,4081.043,4087.75,I imagine the punching in the face of the Protester on the ground is another such case.,104,,
567,0.97,4087.75,4096.258,I think it would be helpful to get a sense of that big picture and follow-up afterwards.,104,,
568,0.97,4096.258,4099.095,I think is fair to say you are correct.,105,,
569,0.97,4099.095,4101.697,Post the case with the officer that put a knee on somebody's neck.,105,,
570,0.97,4101.697,4108.204,The vast majority of complaints are received just by percentage or basically from the first day of the protest until June 1ST.,105,,
571,0.97,4108.204,4112.641,That was the vast majority of cases and complaints we received.,105,,
572,0.97,4112.641,4113.976,We continue to receive them periodically.,105,,
573,0.97,4113.976,4115.01,That was the massive amount that came in.,105,,
574,0.97,4115.01,4118.414,Thank you.,106,,
575,0.97,4118.414,4128.924,"Straight from the get go, in May, we recognized a need to increase transparency.",107,,
576,0.97,4128.924,4132.294,There was a lot of public interest around the protests and how OPA would respond to them.,107,,
577,0.97,4132.294,4140.636,So we put our heads together and came up with a few different ways that we could give the public more information.,107,,
578,0.97,4140.636,4143.472,We created a public Dashboad that shows progress for the protest cases.,107,,
579,0.97,4143.472,4146.442,It has Doughnuts for each case similar to what you are seeing on the screen.,107,,
580,0.97,4146.442,4154.35,And we created a list showing each of the 10 steps in the investigation process just probably.,107,,
581,0.97,4154.35,4163.626,"And it shows, for each of these cases, what step OPA investigators are on for that case.",107,,
582,0.97,4163.626,4180.676,"Every three weeks--and it used to be more frequently, but now we are at every three weeks, we roll out a new batch of cases that we--so we can roll them out on one day and show the public at once instead of trickling them out.",107,,
583,0.97,4180.676,4186.348,"And we put out a Tweet on social media, often to a press release.",107,,
584,0.97,4186.348,4188.551,And Dr. nay for does media interviews to give additional information.,107,,
585,0.97,4188.551,4206.368,Sometimes we have videos we started doing that seem to be very helpful for the public where we have someone on our staff go through and pull pieces of the videos that help to explain the findings that director Myerberg has come to the conclusion about the case.,107,,
586,0.97,4206.368,4207.77,All the Video clips are put together.,107,,
587,0.97,4207.77,4214.81,It is a mix of body worn Video or third-party Video.,107,,
588,0.97,4214.81,4220.216,And we either do a Voiceover narration or have text on the screen.,107,,
589,0.97,4220.216,4231.794,"It is just a much more simple way for the public to see what the findings are rather than reading, for example, a 10 page document that lays it out in detail.",107,,
590,0.97,4231.794,4244.84,So those were a few ways that we expanded our public presence in trying to give more information on where we were at and why we were doing what we were doing.,107,,
591,0.97,4244.84,4257.119,"And relating to the systematic policy recommendations, I know that each report from OPA includes that information when appropriate.",108,,
592,0.97,4257.119,4272.935,"But am wondering, if it is pulled out as well, I know the CPC has, the community police Commission, created a dashboard of its recommendations and tracking which ones are implement it and which ones are not.",108,,
593,0.97,4272.935,4274.737,Wondering if the OPA has already done something like that.,108,,
594,0.97,4274.737,4280.876,I believe you have but just checking.,108,,
595,0.97,4280.876,4302.798,"We have a page on our Website under the policy tab that lists each management action that we have issued and it has a link to the actual letter that we send to the police Department and summarizes the case and the recommendation and lists the status, whether it has been active or partially implemented or fully implemented.",109,,
596,0.97,4302.798,4312.875,"And we link, on that same status, we link documentation that the police Department sends back to us where they describe what they did to put that recommendation into action.",109,,
597,0.97,4312.875,4320.916,Does your report have a findings around those recommendations?,110,,
598,0.97,4320.916,4330.726,"A number of policy recommendations made, the number that SPD has, either in progress or has already taken?",110,,
599,0.97,4330.726,4337.032,This particular annual report does not give a breakdown of the number implemented versus not.,111,,
600,0.97,4337.032,4341.804,"We do list in an Appendix, every recommendation made.",111,,
601,0.97,4341.804,4356.318,"Because the SPD resources were so slim based on staffing and protests and a lot of attrition, they weren't able to address a lot of the recommendations issued in 2020 because they were so late in the year.",111,,
602,0.97,4356.318,4371.767,So it didn't feel like a fair statistic to put in the report that we had issued all of these in the last month of the year but they hadn't implemented them.,111,,
603,0.97,4371.767,4374.77,It takes quite a bit of time to make the policy change.,111,,
604,0.97,4374.77,4375.204,Understand.,112,,
605,0.97,4375.204,4375.504,Thank you.,112,,
606,0.97,4375.504,4384.346,I think we did know where something was declined and I want to say there was only one declined action which means we received a but we are not going to take further action.,113,,
607,0.97,4384.346,4398.06,Most of them have either been implemented or are active evaluations by a speedy.,113,,
608,0.97,4398.06,4401.063,"So in 2020, OPA conducted a lot of state legislative work.",114,,
609,0.97,4401.063,4403.766,This was the first for our office.,114,,
610,0.97,4403.766,4412.608,We conducted--we got a team of staff when all the Protester happening.,114,,
611,0.97,4412.608,4419.515,"There were so many various recommendations from sources in the community, from city Council, from legislators.",114,,
612,0.97,4419.515,4432.094,"We wanted to, and House, take a look at a lot of these recommendations and evaluate how they could be implemented and what kind of research was behind them and what was done in other areas for example.",114,,
613,0.97,4432.094,4434.93,So we started evaluating these recommendations.,114,,
614,0.97,4434.93,4457.419,"We put them all on a spreadsheet and looked at about 52 recommendations and from there, we drafted papers and did a bunch of research and Crafted papers for ourselves to just educate ourselves so we could talk more and talk about this with legislators and Councilmembers about it on 23 of these topics.",114,,
615,0.97,4457.419,4461.089,"And from there, from those 23, we developed seven proposals to highlight for the state Legislature.",114,,
616,0.97,4461.089,4468.697,The seven proposals were the things that OPA felt would be the most effective to implement at the state level.,114,,
617,0.97,4468.697,4476.572,"So these seven, I will run over them very quickly.",114,,
618,0.97,4476.572,4478.006,The first was reforming collective bargaining.,114,,
619,0.97,4478.006,4480.175,The second was improving the officer decertification process.,114,,
620,0.97,4480.175,4487.583,The third was creating an independent special Prosecutor to make charging decisions.,114,,
621,0.97,4487.583,4493.555,The fourth was creating an office to conduct independent Investiations into deadly force by police.,114,,
622,0.97,4493.555,4495.991,The fifth was reforming objective Reasonableness.,114,,
623,0.97,4495.991,4497.593,The sixth was creating a statewide use of force Database.,114,,
624,0.97,4497.593,4506.902,The seventh was to create statewide De-Escalation policies.,114,,
625,0.97,4506.902,4509.671,We transmitted those one Pagers to state legislators.,114,,
626,0.97,4509.671,4518.08,We participated in committee hearings and gave testimony.,114,,
627,0.97,4518.08,4523.585,We engaged in direct meetings to provide facts and answer questions from legislators.,114,,
628,0.97,4523.585,4528.156,And we had a staff member that participated in the governor task force on independent investigations of police use of force.,114,,
629,0.97,4528.156,4538.5,We definitely had a strategy and engagement that we stepped up with for this session of state legislator.,114,,
630,0.97,4538.5,4542.237,And a question on the seven priorities.,115,,
631,0.97,4542.237,4568.43,"For the seven priorities, which of them--I think the question I would have is really focused on improving Seattle's own police accountability system . and how many are in support of the efforts statewide, which of course are very important.",115,,
632,0.97,4568.43,4578.941,"And is a leader here in Seattle, we want to share the work that we have done in approving the statewide system.",115,,
633,0.97,4578.941,4587.049,"For instance, the statewide De- escalation policies and the statewide use of force Database and mandatory reporting.",115,,
634,0.97,4587.049,4606.168,Just wondering how those items would impact Seattle conducting office to conduct independent investigations into deadly force by police.,115,,
635,0.97,4606.168,4619.781,Just trying to get a sense of how many of these were really focused on needed Seattle improvements versus the necessary improvement of police accountability statewide.,115,,
636,0.97,4619.781,4627.622,I can jump in their.,116,,
637,0.97,4627.622,4629.191,I would say it is both.,116,,
638,0.97,4629.191,4631.86,I think most of them would impact Seattle fairly significantly.,116,,
639,0.97,4631.86,4641.536,"For example, putting in place a reform for the objective Reasonableness standard.",116,,
640,0.97,4641.536,4657.953,"One thing I discussed--I disgusted in front of the committee at the Senate side or the House side, that the OPA decision--and this is something not well understood but the OPA decisions are based on the application of a Reasonableness standard.",116,,
641,0.97,4657.953,4670.065,"So we are required under case law to look at, what would a reasonable officer D█O when the officer is placed with the same training experience and not applying 2020 hindsight.",116,,
642,0.97,4670.065,4673.101,It is an extremely Deferential standard for police officers.,116,,
643,0.97,4673.101,4690.619,"One of the things we talked to the Legislature about was, are there reforms you can make to that standard, to make it less Deferential and more in line with any changing expectations around police force.",116,,
644,0.97,4690.619,4693.655,"Ultimately, they did not make changes at the state level to the Reasonableness standard.",116,,
645,0.97,4693.655,4704.699,"What they did do and we were very supportive of this, is they did create a baseline policy for both De-Escalation and use of force that would be applied statewide, which we thought was great.",116,,
646,0.97,4704.699,4705.901,We were very supportive of it.,116,,
647,0.97,4705.901,4709.471,We worked with those legislators to develop the.,116,,
648,0.97,4709.471,4723.585,"For example, the statewide entity that would look at all deadly force--right now, SPD is under consent decree but absent is the legislation when it comes to the consent degree lifted.",116,,
649,0.97,4723.585,4727.489,Is pretty would have been investigate a by a task force of officers from other jurisdictions.,116,,
650,0.97,4727.489,4728.557,We pushed for years.,116,,
651,0.97,4728.557,4739.835,And this is not just okay but it is Oig and the Seattle deadly force investigation cap task force that was convened a couple years ago pushing for exactly this.,116,,
652,0.97,4739.835,4746.308,"To have an independent civilian blood, civilian staffed entity that investigates deadly use of force statewide.",116,,
653,0.97,4746.308,4747.576,So this is a huge accomplishment.,116,,
654,0.97,4747.576,4754.549,It is something we were very supportive of and very much mirrored what our liquidations were in our proposal.,116,,
655,0.97,4754.549,4761.756,The Database is something we feel very strongly about and feels very important.,116,,
656,0.97,4761.756,4763.258,We did not get the special prosecutor.,116,,
657,0.97,4763.258,4769.164,This is another thing that OPA feels is very important.,116,,
658,0.97,4769.164,4780.041,The charging decision should be with someone totally independent of political pressure and someone that can make a decision without worrying about working with the same officers the next day or the next month.,116,,
659,0.97,4780.041,4793.588,And not that we are doubting the ability of elected prosecutors to do so but it puts another layer of accountability and transparency to have a special prosecutor.,116,,
660,0.97,4793.588,4796.358,So these are all things that will probably be a future.,116,,
661,0.97,4796.358,4797.225,"For example, collective bargaining.",116,,
662,0.97,4797.225,4805.1,One thing we discussed was the possibility of putting in and creating a law that would say that accountability bargaining is affects only.,116,,
663,0.97,4805.1,4812.207,So you wouldn't Bargainable Mentation but just the effects of the bargaining.,116,,
664,0.97,4812.207,4815.31,There are changes that still need to be done for arbitration.,116,,
665,0.97,4815.31,4820.048,There are a lot of things out there that we cannot do at the city level necessarily but that greatly impact city work.,116,,
666,0.97,4820.048,4840.535,"Exactly why I asked the question, you and I both often say that we are hampered by the consent decree and making changes to our current system because any changes we would make would have to be approved by the court.",117,,
667,0.97,4840.535,4874.369,"And we are also limited in our ability to make changes because of our current contract with Spog so I'm interested in the changes that would, in Realtime, make improvements to the Seattle current system that we were successful in making progress at with the state level.",117,,
668,0.97,4874.369,4887.782,"And also really appreciating the advocacy that is really important to do with our partners all over the state, including police accountability advocates for statewide reforms which may not directly impact Seattle.",117,,
669,0.97,4887.782,4890.085,So really appreciate the detail they are.,117,,
670,0.97,4890.085,4900.795,I would also say the decertification bill also is an extremely important bill that has come out and there was a lot of work by Seattle partners on that bill.,118,,
671,0.97,4900.795,4906.668,We worked very closely with Senator Peterson Pedersen's office.,118,,
672,0.97,4906.668,4908.303,There was a lot of work that went into it.,118,,
673,0.97,4908.303,4915.41,And this is very much a change in police accountability too that it can now investigate use of force.,118,,
674,0.97,4915.41,4923.251,Is another check on local jurisdiction that don't have any independent internal affairs.,118,,
675,0.97,4923.251,4931.226,"Because Seattle, for all the criticisms of our system, as far as I'm aware, we are the only internal affairs system across the state that is civilian led and civilian staff.",118,,
676,0.97,4931.226,4945.607,"So again, empowering the Cjtc to take more affirmative action and make sure officers don't get employed again is another big change occurring within the system.",118,,
677,0.97,4945.607,4947.142,So we were very happy with the result.,118,,
678,0.97,4947.142,4954.449,Obviously we did not get everything we supported past and we excited that.,118,,
679,0.97,4954.449,4961.423,But the progress made this last legislative session was immense.,118,,
680,0.97,4961.423,4961.79,Thank you.,119,,
681,0.97,4961.79,4964.659,I will talk briefly about staff being this past year.,120,,
682,0.97,4964.659,4965.76,This is the current organizational chart.,120,,
683,0.97,4965.76,4969.898,This is actually the 2020 organization.,121,,
684,0.97,4969.898,4970.932,It is the 2020 chart.,122,,
685,0.97,4970.932,4985.213,"As you can see, we fully civilian eyes the two open civilian spots . and we are still I believe it eight sworn two civilian investigators.",122,,
686,0.97,4985.213,4991.386,"We expect the--I'm sorry, nine and two.",122,,
687,0.97,4991.386,4993.455,"Again, that is a function of the contract.",122,,
688,0.97,4993.455,5021.416,"And I think people always say that you should civilian eyes half of your staff and we don't have the ability to do that--since the first contract was passed, we civilian eyes all the investigation supervisors, the two lieutenants and captain and have added those civilian investigators.",122,,
689,0.97,5021.416,5026.621,Our expectation and they were agreed upon by all the parties and will move forward accordingly.,122,,
690,0.97,5026.621,5048.143,A couple future and state issues for 2021. one thing mentioned earlier about transparency is one thing we found very effective which was the creation of videos and putting up videos that explain not just what occurred but showing the multiple angles and going to the conclusions and why we reach those conclusions.,122,,
691,0.97,5048.143,5060.688,My hope in 2021 is to bring on a full-time Video analyst that will have that be there Full- time job and they will be responsible for creating a Video Ideally for every single sustained and Nonsustained case that will explain the findings.,122,,
692,0.97,5060.688,5067.228,That can be provided both to the complainant and can be linked to the closed case summary when it goes Online.,122,,
693,0.97,5067.228,5080.074,"It is putting more information out there and having people, even if they disagree, understand how we decide what we decided and how we got to where we got.",122,,
694,0.97,5080.074,5082.777,"We are also, as we talked about, very focused on data and Dashboards.",122,,
695,0.97,5082.777,5092.387,"One thing we are working on for example, we rolled out the appeals dashboard and the physicians of those appeals.",122,,
696,0.97,5092.387,5101.663,W will work on putting together a dashboard given some of the public concern with the chief's reversal of the--case.,122,,
697,0.97,5101.663,5115.577,A dashboard that talks about every case that has been reversed based on the chain of command disagree with OPA and links all the relevant documents so people can see for themselves what the rationale was and what the reversal was and what the result of it was.,122,,
698,0.97,5115.577,5130.625,"For example, with the pink umbrella case, that would include linking like you said Councilmember Herbold about Councilmember Lewis as well as correspondence from the chief and the underlying decision and a letter disagreeing and any discipline eventually imposed.",122,,
699,0.97,5130.625,5135.33,"Having this information all in one place, it seems like a small thing but I think with information comes power.",122,,
700,0.97,5135.33,5139.534,So as much information we can put out there is super important for Moore perspective.,122,,
701,0.97,5139.534,5142.837,Thank you.,123,,
702,0.97,5142.837,5157.418,"For the investigative unit, could you, just for the viewing public,--tell us, what is the limiting language of the contract.",123,,
703,0.97,5157.418,5157.785,Specifically.,123,,
704,0.97,5157.785,5161.956,Is it specifically civilian investigators are allowed?,123,,
705,0.97,5161.956,5171.332,So the specific language that OPA can hire up to two civilian investigators.,124,,
706,0.97,5171.332,5175.537,He gave us a specific number.,124,,
707,0.97,5175.537,5186.514,"If you are accountability ordinance from 2017 did not have a specific number but basically what it said was, it should be in the OPA director discretion to decide what the staffing arrangement will be.",124,,
708,0.97,5186.514,5203.798,Certainly the monitor--before he left was a very strong supporter with a 50/50 split of civilian versus investigators.,124,,
709,0.97,5203.798,5208.603,I'm not sure at this point if there are questions about what we discussed or questions about certain cases.,125,,
710,0.97,5208.603,5216.01,I know Councilmember Sawant had brought up the child pepper spray case.,125,,
711,0.97,5216.01,5217.612,I'm happy to walk to that finding.,125,,
712,0.97,5217.612,5224.319,I think I have already gone through it but I'm happy again to describe why we issued the finding we issued in that case.,125,,
713,0.97,5224.319,5227.121,If that would be helpful.,125,,
714,0.97,5227.121,5243.137,"And I'm happy to talk about some of the recommendations we have made specifically around demonstration management, some of the things we have pushed for and what we have seen as far as changes in tactics and what we expect the tactics to look like like if protests occur again this summer.",125,,
715,0.97,5243.137,5246.441,"It is really up to the Council, as to what we answer, if anything.",125,,
716,0.97,5246.441,5253.982,I see Councilmember Morales' hand is up.,126,,
717,0.97,5253.982,5262.156,Sorry.,127,,
718,0.97,5262.156,5262.89,I will lower it.,127,,
719,0.97,5262.89,5270.131,"I think would be helpful to--address, you are on record around the child pepper spray case.",128,,
720,0.97,5270.131,5281.242,"For the viewing public that may have missed it, going over the investigation and the findings, it would be useful.",128,,
721,0.97,5281.242,5292.954,"I do have a question related to, back on slide three for employees with seven, nine, 11 and 14 complaints.",128,,
722,0.97,5292.954,5339.133,"And I'm just wondering, on that one, when you will know how many, if any, of the complaints will be sustained against officers with a large number of allegations, and whether or not we reported out that way so that the other components of the police accountability system, the Oig and the CPC as well as the general public,--I understand there is a requirement to not be involved with the identity of the officer complaints against them even when sustained.",128,,
723,0.97,5339.133,5346.074,"And we know for those particular officers that have a lot of complaints against them, how many of those complaints were sustained.",128,,
724,0.97,5346.074,5348.342,And absolutely.,128,,
725,0.97,5348.342,5362.023,"Talking to some of the policy changes that were made because of your work, especially in the area of changes that the Department has made around crowd control weapons.",128,,
726,0.97,5362.023,5364.592,"I'm sorry, crowd control, I should say.",128,,
727,0.97,5364.592,5374.969,And how that was in response to feedback received by SPD from the OPA would be useful as well.,128,,
728,0.97,5374.969,5379.607,"And also, opening up to the questions of other Councilmembers here as well.",128,,
729,0.97,5379.607,5385.38,I will start with the first question.,129,,
730,0.97,5385.38,5394.389,The complaint of the child pepper spray case came from the Video taken in the aftermath of the pepper spray occurring where the child was in the middle of the street and was crying.,129,,
731,0.97,5394.389,5396.858,What we did was we went backwards.,129,,
732,0.97,5396.858,5399.26,We worked to isolate where the child was in the crowd.,129,,
733,0.97,5399.26,5405.6,Because that part of the Video was taken after the fact and did not show the use of force itself.,129,,
734,0.97,5405.6,5408.403,We were able to isolate where the pepper spraying occurred.,129,,
735,0.97,5408.403,5415.409,"As you all may recall, initially, an officer was identified by name as being the opposite of that used the pepper spray.",129,,
736,0.97,5415.409,5419.013,And we determined pretty quickly that that was not the officer that had done so.,129,,
737,0.97,5419.013,5420.581,But we were able to identify who did.,129,,
738,0.97,5420.581,5434.028,"Looking at the Video and looking at the body worn Video between 8-10 officers on the line, what we were able to see is that at some point, they made an arrest at the Right- hand side of the line.",129,,
739,0.97,5434.028,5445.74,It was an individual that had thrown pepper spray at an officer earlier and then had drawn the pepper spray bottle at the officer.,129,,
740,0.97,5445.74,5447.809,That was discussed at another complaint.,129,,
741,0.97,5447.809,5454.015,We evaluated and saw that that individual that was identified as doing that was arrested at the right side of the line.,129,,
742,0.97,5454.015,5459.654,"When they did this, the officers moved out to push the line back to allow a buffer to make the arrest.",129,,
743,0.97,5459.654,5467.862,What happened was that people convened into the line and started Pushinginto the officers.,129,,
744,0.97,5467.862,5476.17,"At that moment, a male with the Úchild was viewed quickly walking toward the line and going toward where the conflict was occurring.",129,,
745,0.97,5476.17,5483.578,The officer at that point deployed pepper spray at a woman who was actively grabbing another officer's baton.,129,,
746,0.97,5483.578,5493.955,That woman turned and ducked at the time and the pepper spray went off of her shoulder and struck the father and the kid who were standing directly behind that woman.,129,,
747,0.97,5493.955,5503.764,"So when we evaluated the deployment of pepper spray, what we looked at was first of all, was the pepper spray of the woman pushing to the line and grabbing the baton, was it justified?",129,,
748,0.97,5503.764,5508.202,"From my perspective, the answer is yes.",129,,
749,0.97,5508.202,5512.773,The woman was pushing through the line and was grabbing on to the officer's baton.,129,,
750,0.97,5512.773,5515.51,They had other people pushing through the line and it was a chaotic situation.,129,,
751,0.97,5515.51,5522.016,They are entitled as a matter of law to move the crowd back and prevent her from doing so.,129,,
752,0.97,5522.016,5524.051,The officers asked when they had a couple of options available.,129,,
753,0.97,5524.051,5527.455,The use of a glass ball which would have been an appropriate.,129,,
754,0.97,5527.455,5532.627,They could have gone hands-on and pulled the woman down or pushed her away or used some force or they could have deployed pepper spray.,129,,
755,0.97,5532.627,5541.435,They felt that pepper spray directed toward this person was the best option for the circumstances and I agree.,129,,
756,0.97,5541.435,5554.315,"The question then was, was it a foreseeable result that the pepper stray, that the woman would dock and the pepper spray would bounce off of her back and hit the father and the child who had moved behind them?",129,,
757,0.97,5554.315,5555.65,"From my perspective, the answer was no.",129,,
758,0.97,5555.65,5562.056,It was not a foreseeable result of that use of force that targeted the female.,129,,
759,0.97,5562.056,5564.458,So this was a decision that obviously was a difficult decision to reach.,129,,
760,0.97,5564.458,5568.963,"There was a lot of criticism regarding the decision, which I except.",129,,
761,0.97,5568.963,5574.969,"The reality is, no matter what I say about this, I have described my findings on this multiple times.",129,,
762,0.97,5574.969,5577.972,No matter there will be people that disagree with the findings and that is totally acceptable.,129,,
763,0.97,5577.972,5580.274,You can disagree with me and say I'm wrong and that's fine.,129,,
764,0.97,5580.274,5588.149,"Looking at the policies in place at the time and looking at the conduct and looking at the Video and Accessing the interviews, that is the finding we reached.",129,,
765,0.97,5588.149,5602.196,"What it will say is that, I think is correct to say that that case in and of itself did not result in a change of policy surrounding pepper spray.",129,,
766,0.97,5602.196,5610.705,And I think it is accurate to say that I did not support the Council's initial bill that would have put a ban on all devices.,129,,
767,0.97,5610.705,5612.907,That was the initial Iteration that was changed over time.,129,,
768,0.97,5612.907,5624.819,"I'm significantly more supportive of the bill that exists now that I think is much more targeted and understands that while we never went anything like that to be used in a protest, there may be times it is required.",129,,
769,0.97,5624.819,5626.587,So there is a balance.,129,,
770,0.97,5626.587,5634.595,So Councilmember support with Sawant--I don't support all the tools but I don't think is realistic.,129,,
771,0.97,5634.595,5647.608,"I do support in one of the changes and liquidations made over the last couple of cases is, more and more, I tend to support a blanket ban on blast balls for example.",129,,
772,0.97,5647.608,5658.452,"I'm very concerned with blast balls and the fact that even if you deploy a Bast blast ball perfectly, it can move 10 feet in another direction and shrapnel can come off and affect other people.",129,,
773,0.97,5658.452,5671.632,"I think what we have scene is that using a blast ball to move crowds should not be done and the blast ball, if ever used, should be to target a specific and direct threat.",129,,
774,0.97,5671.632,5673.567,"But again, I don't like blast balls.",129,,
775,0.97,5673.567,5675.436,They are the least targeted of tools that is.,129,,
776,0.97,5675.436,5676.504,Officers have at their disposal.,129,,
777,0.97,5676.504,5684.378,I think that it is inaccurate to say that we haven't pushed for changes to both the law and policy.,129,,
778,0.97,5684.378,5684.745,We have.,129,,
779,0.97,5684.745,5691.786,"And many of the changes as PD has put into place--for example, they will not use blast balls simply to move crowds.",129,,
780,0.97,5691.786,5699.593,They are required to point to specific identifiable threat of harm when you will be using the blast balls on people.,129,,
781,0.97,5699.593,5708.069,And these are the results of the cases we have investigated in liquidations we have made along with the work our partners have done in the CDC and the Oig.,129,,
782,0.97,5708.069,5709.703,So other tactical changes that have gone into place.,129,,
783,0.97,5709.703,5730.424,"One thing we really pushed for and this was a result of the report Councilmember Herbold asked us to issue early on, is we had pushed for, if the protests are about SPD to stop interacting directly with protesters, one of the big tactical mistakes that SPD was engaged in--and this isn't rocket science.",129,,
784,0.97,5730.424,5740.434,"Spd has admitted this and has confirmed this, it is creating artificial lines in trying to move crowds when it was unnecessary.",129,,
785,0.97,5740.434,5746.407,"Again, there is always a balance between preventing property destruction and harm to people.",129,,
786,0.97,5746.407,5751.445,But interfering with protests and not allowing people to walk to the city and make their voices heard.,129,,
787,0.97,5751.445,5757.551,I think what they would do differently this summer is they will not be creating lines like we saw at the East precinct.,129,,
788,0.97,5757.551,5763.858,They will not be trying to dictate where everybody is moving at any given time.,129,,
789,0.97,5763.858,5768.562,I think they will stage and respond to life safety issues and intervene with specific acts of criminality.,129,,
790,0.97,5768.562,5776.07,"Other than that, they will let Úpeople exercise their first amendment rights without causing conflict.",129,,
791,0.97,5776.07,5782.042,I think this goes to De- escalation and reducing harm and increasing public trust and confidence.,129,,
792,0.97,5782.042,5793.988,"And at the end of the day, I applaud SPD for modifying the tactic and doing so in response to what they heard both from the Council and from the accountability entities.",129,,
793,0.97,5793.988,5806.867,"Other things that were put into place as we push for better communication with the Oig, a lot of what we saw early on is that people, for example, if you have 5000 people of the crowd, it is possible people in the back and I hear the dispersal order.",130,,
794,0.97,5806.867,5812.773,"And for people concerned, it cannot be used as an acoustic weapon.",130,,
795,0.97,5812.773,5816.61,It is only an amplifier.,130,,
796,0.97,5816.61,5822.516,So that is used to amplify warnings.,130,,
797,0.97,5822.516,5831.625,And you can hear from all areas of the crowd what was being announced.,130,,
798,0.97,5831.625,5838.632,And you know what dangers may be present.,130,,
799,0.97,5838.632,5844.505,And this can be communicated better with the protesters that should yield better outcomes.,130,,
800,0.97,5844.505,5854.949,We are anticipating and we are excited to see the results of the Oig review which we expect will have even more systemic recommendations with more of a community lens we have a very systematic system lens.,130,,
801,0.97,5854.949,5877.471,And we think that they will be talking more about communication and even having people specifically geared to communicate within crowds and coordinate with people to coordinate goals and tactics and decisions by the police Department and try to build communication and cooperation with them.,130,,
802,0.97,5877.471,5888.048,We expect a very different response to these protests and what we saw last spring and into the summer.,130,,
803,0.97,5888.048,5889.516,And we have been to the training.,130,,
804,0.97,5889.516,5891.852,We have seen Rollouts of the tactics.,130,,
805,0.97,5891.852,5893.387,This isn't just conjecture.,130,,
806,0.97,5893.387,5895.589,This is what I have seen.,130,,
807,0.97,5895.589,5898.492,And we will be holding SPD accountable to the new standards.,130,,
808,0.97,5898.492,5904.865,"And again, we expect to see positive changes.",130,,
809,0.97,5904.865,5907.101,"Lauren, there was another question I skipped over.",130,,
810,0.97,5907.101,5910.17,It was about the number of complaints against certain individuals.,130,,
811,0.97,5910.17,5912.206,I don't know if you want to talk about the.,130,,
812,0.97,5912.206,5921.015,I would Guesstimate that some of those are supervisors who were named in multiple complaints for the ones that had seven or 11 --,130,,
813,0.97,5921.015,5925.386,A lot of them were heavily involved in the protest response last year.,131,,
814,0.97,5925.386,5933.227,"I remember when we presented last year, the annual report, at the end of it, you asked for a similar set of data.",131,,
815,0.97,5933.227,5940.434,I can run that data on those officers who received seven or more complaints and they give you the outcome of that.,131,,
816,0.97,5940.434,5943.137,And we don't identify the officers by name.,131,,
817,0.97,5943.137,5948.342,And we wouldn't report specifically on those cases because it involves the officers not identified.,131,,
818,0.97,5948.342,5959.553,And I would guess that some of those would be supervisors in charge of multiple protest responses.,132,,
819,0.97,5959.553,5962.556,Higher up the chain of command.,133,,
820,0.97,5962.556,5962.823,Correct.,133,,
821,0.97,5962.823,5966.06,Thank you.,134,,
822,0.97,5966.06,5977.971,I'm just wanting to make sure that my colleagues don't have any additional questions.,135,,
823,0.97,5977.971,6004.198,"I have one additional protest complaint related question and then I want to move, shift over to use of force complaints from--related to individuals in behavioral and mental health crises.",135,,
824,0.97,6004.198,6057.851,"So related to recommendations that you see as potentially coming out of your investigation of protests related complaints, I have noted that it might be useful to make changes to Seattle's bill of rights, and recognition both of the courage of observers like Darnell Frazier who used her rights to observe and record the murder of George Floyd, but it occurs to me that we have a law that is our own sort of codification of the rights of people to observe and record.",135,,
825,0.97,6057.851,6071.231,But it might be useful to make some changes to that law coming out of potential recommendations that you have from investigations that you have done.,135,,
826,0.97,6071.231,6080.941,"I believe, director Myerberg, you have Referenced some changes you might like to see specifically related to the rights of the press.",135,,
827,0.97,6080.941,6110.304,I have noted that there were charges that officers obscured observers viewing of certain actions that they were taking in instances where the protesters were not--a distance it was unsafe to observe.,135,,
828,0.97,6110.304,6111.205,They were a safe distance away.,135,,
829,0.97,6111.205,6118.712,But yet it appeared that officers intentionally were blocking the view.,135,,
830,0.97,6118.712,6131.325,Just wondering whether or not you might have some additional recommendations for us to strengthen what I think is a really important law here in Seattle.,135,,
831,0.97,6131.325,6135.329,I have one recommendation that came out of the July 25th protest.,136,,
832,0.97,6135.329,6155.249,"It was surrounding the increase of protections for both media and legal observers and creating designated areas, making sure that, unless absolutely necessary, that you are not dispersing those folks out of an area and they are not being subject to force.",136,,
833,0.97,6155.249,6171.832,"The complicated factor is that there are times when media may be interspersed in demonstrations and may be in front of or in the midst of a demonstration and it would be very difficult, if for example, there was a life safety issue, it would be difficult to not affect the media.",136,,
834,0.97,6171.832,6178.438,"Where the media is in an area off to the side, they need a vantage point.",136,,
835,0.97,6178.438,6183.277,And also they need to be mindful that there may be a law enforcement need to disperse the crowd.,136,,
836,0.97,6183.277,6185.179,It is creating that balance.,136,,
837,0.97,6185.179,6189.349,It is something we have asked the Department to further develop and its tactical plans action plans and policies.,136,,
838,0.97,6189.349,6206.266,"I would say fundamental, mentioning people that have taken the role of recordings--I would also give credit to Lamar Saulsberry who is fundamental to our understanding of some of the things that went wrong in these protests.",136,,
839,0.97,6206.266,6207.734,"For example, the June 1ST pink umbrella case.",136,,
840,0.97,6207.734,6225.219,That Video caught that firsthand and showed the experience of someone in the front of the line and was a huge piece of evidence that we relied upon.,136,,
841,0.97,6225.219,6229.723,"For the ordinance you had championed, Councilmember Herbold, without evidence.",136,,
842,0.97,6229.723,6232.059,We feel like it is very important obviously and we have recommended changes.,136,,
843,0.97,6232.059,6239.933,And I can update the Council at a later point and we will update the Council to let you know what changes were put into place by SPD.,136,,
844,0.97,6239.933,6240.867,Thank you director Myerberg.,137,,
845,0.97,6240.867,6282.676,"On the issue of use of force and Individuls and the behavior or mental health crisis, I just want to get a little bit of information specifically on--because I understand we are--this is a case that is--I don't know if it is bumping up against the deadline, but it it is of the death at the hands of police last year, I think it is the oldest one.",137,,
846,0.97,6282.676,6283.477,The Terry cave or case.,137,,
847,0.97,6283.477,6288.749,Just a little bit of a sense of what the Timeline is for your Dispositional not.,137,,
848,0.97,6288.749,6290.083,Another is a lot of interest in that.,137,,
849,0.97,6290.083,6308.802,"It is a case that there is a lot of concern with, with the officers and the De-Escalation tactics used in that particular, unfortunate case.",137,,
850,0.97,6308.802,6331.992,"And if you could speak a little bit to some of the recommendations that I know that you, the inspector general, judge and myself, have made to SPD around less lethal force tools that can be used in these types of cases.",137,,
851,0.97,6331.992,6341.134,I had the opportunity to participate with the CPC and other members of the community and the office of the inspector general was represented as well.,137,,
852,0.97,6341.134,6349.076,And on a demonstration of a new tool that the Department is considering piloting.,137,,
853,0.97,6349.076,6350.744,Maybe you can talk a little bit about that as well.,137,,
854,0.97,6350.744,6365.926,"I want to be, as far as the shooting of Terry cave or, I want to be cognizant of the fact that while my investigation has been completed, it is still an open case.",138,,
855,0.97,6365.926,6377.17,I don't necessarily feel comfortable right now Commenting on this disposition until that has gone three for the resolution.,138,,
856,0.97,6377.17,6410.47,A big focus for that case and certainly for the shooting of Derek Hayden was looking at the tactics and decision-making of the officer and whether the failure to apply certain topics may have increased the likelihood that the high-level force would be used and that certainly is the fundamental question for those cases and those will likely be relevant to each other and to the determination that we reach.,138,,
857,0.97,6410.47,6418.512,And I think I will probably have an update in the next 30 days about what the final disposition is on that case.,138,,
858,0.97,6418.512,6422.816,That I can say that the OPA work is done and we are waiting for further proceedings.,138,,
859,0.97,6422.816,6432.426,"As far as recommendations, one of the things we have seen from that case and from others--this is not new.",138,,
860,0.97,6432.426,6437.03,It is John tea Williams as well.,138,,
861,0.97,6437.03,6443.336,Please officers of people armed with knives and not all cases with knives are created equal.,138,,
862,0.97,6443.336,6455.382,"Certainly the ones very concerning for us are the ones where you have the ability to put into place time, distance and shielding and you don't.",138,,
863,0.97,6455.382,6460.854,"For example, the John Williams case, the officer was--multiple feet away from Mr.",138,,
864,0.97,6460.854,6466.726,Williams and where there were other steps he could have taken prior to firing his gun.,138,,
865,0.97,6466.726,6474.234,"The consensus was that yes, there were.",138,,
866,0.97,6474.234,6475.268,And same with these other cases.,138,,
867,0.97,6475.268,6493.053,"The problem is right now the only tool--if you get to the point where you need to use force, the only tool that makes a lot of sense in that scenario is a 40-Millimeter launcher which is--it shoots a round that can and give us to a person with a knife.",138,,
868,0.97,6493.053,6498.358,The issue with that is very few people are trained with a 40- millimeter.,138,,
869,0.97,6498.358,6500.06,And maybe a couple of people on the squad.,138,,
870,0.97,6500.06,6503.296,So not every officer is trained with a 40-Millimeter.,138,,
871,0.97,6503.296,6511.605,"In some cases, if there is not a 40-Millimeter trained officer present and you don't have a 40- millimeter at the scene, it greatly limits the amount of standoff distance you can have.",138,,
872,0.97,6511.605,6527.988,"One thing Councilmember Herbold had mentioned and that I actually had issued a reclamation to the Department to consider is, it has different terms but it is called basically a net gun.",138,,
873,0.97,6527.988,6529.923,"What it would do is, it sounds kind of ridiculous.",138,,
874,0.97,6529.923,6535.529,What it would do is literally shoot a net.,138,,
875,0.97,6535.529,6544.638,It sounds--it should saying that that would go around an individual and prevent the individual from moving and because the individual to fall down to the ground.,138,,
876,0.97,6544.638,6548.441,I think we are very open to a lot of different possibilities.,138,,
877,0.97,6548.441,6554.08,I think SPD has gotten the approval to get one and maybe you saw the demonstration of it Councilmember Herbold.,138,,
878,0.97,6554.08,6555.649,We think that everything needs to be out there.,138,,
879,0.97,6555.649,6564.424,The other big gap is just training.,138,,
880,0.97,6564.424,6565.258,And training is everything.,138,,
881,0.97,6565.258,6577.671,"Both from Academy, when you are taught that anyone with a knife represents a mortal threat to you no matter how far away they are.",138,,
882,0.97,6577.671,6581.274,Many police academies across the country teach this.,138,,
883,0.97,6581.274,6582.776,"And also, the training you get internally.",138,,
884,0.97,6582.776,6594.354,Very few officers--SPD doesn't have this sort of a fluid and mobile training where you are outside and you are following someone down the street and all the sudden they turn toward you and run.,138,,
885,0.97,6594.354,6599.092,That is not trained in SPD.,138,,
886,0.97,6599.092,6601.761,We very much feel like it would make sense.,138,,
887,0.97,6601.761,6603.663,And we know the limitations for Covid-19 and for resources.,138,,
888,0.97,6603.663,6616.409,But to have an outdoor fluid training method puts officers into the scenarios they are going to face in real life and not just to rely on classroom training.,138,,
889,0.97,6616.409,6629.089,"If you don't build up muscle memory and ability to contemplate the situations, what you then expect is you will put someone in a classroom and then out in the street and you are going to expect them to make a perfect decision.",138,,
890,0.97,6629.089,6631.725,It will happen in some cases but it won't happen in other cases.,138,,
891,0.97,6631.725,6640.133,"And how you ensure you have good outcomes, I think it comes down to better policies, better tools and better training.",138,,
892,0.97,6640.133,6644.137,And that is really what we are Pusing for SPD.,138,,
893,0.97,6644.137,6646.039,And I think Oig is on the same page.,138,,
894,0.97,6646.039,6649.309,And SPD has been a very willing partner.,138,,
895,0.97,6649.309,6651.011,I think they understand there has been a gap.,138,,
896,0.97,6651.011,6652.112,This has been a nationwide gap.,138,,
897,0.97,6652.112,6658.618,I don't know any other jurisdiction that does this well.,138,,
898,0.97,6658.618,6665.959,It doesn't give a speedy an excuse but it means that SPD has the opportunity to innovate and create a better way.,138,,
899,0.97,6665.959,6676.102,"And I think the vision from the chief, the articulated vision of the chief's we never have another shooting of a person with a knife.",138,,
900,0.97,6676.102,6682.642,"Thank you so much, director Myerberg.",139,,
901,0.97,6682.642,6685.245,Those are all the questions that I have.,139,,
902,0.97,6685.245,6707.1,"I appreciate your ongoing work and your recognition that our system of accountability is evolving and sometimes the criticisms that we receive about our system, that leads to ongoing and enhanced improvements to that system.",139,,
903,0.97,6707.1,6712.205,"Councilmember, if I can add one note to the.",140,,
904,0.97,6712.205,6722.215,"I would caution, all of us who think about those questions, it is to say, it is good to sometimes have perspective as to where we have, and where we are.",140,,
905,0.97,6722.215,6734.828,"I think in 2017, when the systems were created, they were not created to say, this is all--we will never change the systems or get past the systems.",140,,
906,0.97,6734.828,6739.332,The reality is the systems created in 2017 were created based on extensive research.,140,,
907,0.97,6739.332,6747.841,"I was part of the team working as the Council and attorney to work on the research and come up with, what are the models across the country and what Úexisted?",140,,
908,0.97,6747.841,6751.044,I think we were confident across the board that this was the best model that existed.,140,,
909,0.97,6751.044,6762.555,"I think to this point, I don't know the model yet that I think is a better model than what we have with regards to our system of checks and balances and our Pre-Accountability entities.",140,,
910,0.97,6762.555,6764.757,It doesn't mean the system will be perfect.,140,,
911,0.97,6764.757,6770.463,"What I think is that out of all the models that exist, we probably have the best.",140,,
912,0.97,6770.463,6774.734,Does that mean we don't try to change it?,140,,
913,0.97,6774.734,6775.168,No.,140,,
914,0.97,6775.168,6776.97,Of course it doesn't mean that.,140,,
915,0.97,6776.97,6781.274,I want to be careful with the changes we create because they should be based on evidence.,140,,
916,0.97,6781.274,6782.976,They should be based on research.,140,,
917,0.97,6782.976,6792.786,They should be based on changes that would be positive and not just coming up with a system that will have its own flaws and are systems we may be those--reasons why they were not adopted in 2017.,140,,
918,0.97,6792.786,6801.461,And so I caution to recognize that we have and the benefits and work Collaboratively to keep improving them so we will be willing partner.,140,,
919,0.97,6801.461,6805.398,You are muted.,141,,
920,0.97,6805.398,6812.705,Thank you director Myerberg.,142,,
921,0.97,6812.705,6841.634,"On that same note, I want to recognize some of the words of Reverend Harriet Walden in a recent letter specifically focused on the need for ongoing and continued improvement on reduction of the use of force and with a specific focus on individuals and behavioral mental health crisis.",142,,
922,0.97,6841.634,6854.981,"She wrote, in 2012, the city entered into a consent decree with the Department of justice that guaranteed an expansion of the program to reduce the use of force against individuals and Behaviorl or mental health crisis.",142,,
923,0.97,6854.981,6865.758,"At that time, 70% of all use of force encounters between citizens and SPD officers involved people in a behavioral health crisis.",142,,
924,0.97,6865.758,6881.941,"At this point, as of the last analysis, it was received in 2020, based on 2019 numbers.",142,,
925,0.97,6881.941,6885.278,But SPD has reduced the percentage to 23%.,142,,
926,0.97,6885.278,6893.886,Sold for only 3% of all use of force encounters Arnell against individuals and behavioral or mental health crisis.,142,,
