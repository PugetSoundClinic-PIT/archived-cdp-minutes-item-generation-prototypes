110,0.97,534.0,543.276,"Rates would be set by operational needs of the building including maintenance, any kind of loan service and other operational needs.",43,,
111,0.97,543.276,561.36,"Residents have the opportunity to participate in the decision making through being on the board of the PDA through the government's Council of buildings and would also have the opportunity for restorative justice, conflict resolution prior to Eviction proceedings.",43,,
112,0.97,561.36,572.471,"The Charter also stipulates that if possible, buildings should be built to passive House standards and to use Union labor.",43,,
113,0.97,572.471,579.578,The initiative includes the Charter that authorizes the creation of a 13 member board.,43,,
114,0.97,579.578,592.191,"The anything appointments would be made by the Seattle Commission, King County labor Council, Elcentro Delarazza, city Council, Mayor's office and the green new deal Oversoikt board.",43,,

124,0.97,684.784,692.024,"As you recall, the council must enact or reject the measure.",43,,
125,0.97,692.024,704.837,It is based on article 4 of the Seattle city charter and specifically it States that the Council may enact or reject any initiative but shall not amend or modify the same.,43,,
126,0.97,704.837,714.68,It may after rejection impose and pass a different measure dealing with the same subject.,43,,
127,0.97,714.68,717.983,It means they must reenact or object the measure.,43,,
128,0.97,717.983,726.725,To file a certificate of sufficiency and pass an ordinance enacting provisions of I135.,43,,
129,0.97,726.725,728.194,The Council can reject the measure.,43,,
130,0.97,728.194,734.533,That is choosing not to enact it and placing the initiative on the ballot to be decided by Seattle voters.,43,,
131,0.97,734.533,745.411,"If the Council does not want to enact the initiative, it needs to file the initiative of certificate and place the initiative on the ballot.",43,,
132,0.97,745.411,752.852,"In addition to enacting or rejecting, the Council may choose to create an alternative to be placed on the ballot with I-135.",43,,
133,0.97,752.852,762.361,The council could also choose to adopt a resolution in support of or in opposition to I-135.,43,,

138,0.97,800.299,805.838,The King County elections has provided the certification of the initiative signatures.,43,,
139,0.97,805.838,812.711,"Tomorrow with the introduction of the clerk file, reporting on the certification and initiative.",43,,
140,0.97,812.711,816.515,Council has 45 days to act.,43,,
141,0.97,816.515,825.758,Resolution 302-69 which would place initiative 135 on the February 14th pallet will be introduced tomorrow with potential action Council on September 20th.,43,,
142,0.97,825.758,832.665,That is well in advance of the deadline for Council action on this matter which is October 28th.,43,,
143,0.97,832.665,835.267,That is all that I had prepared for today.,43,,
144,0.97,835.267,841.907,But I'm happy to answer any questions about the initiative or the Council process.,43,,
145,0.97,841.907,842.575,"Thank you, Amy.",44,,
146,0.97,842.575,845.544,It looks like Councilmember Lewis has his hand up.,44,,
147,0.97,845.544,847.68,"Amy, thank you for that presentation.",45,,
148,0.97,847.68,854.92,Can we go back to the slide that talks about cost?,45,,
149,0.97,854.92,858.224,Yes.,46,,
150,0.97,858.224,867.633,What is the thinking behind the 18 month support for the leadership of the PDA?,47,,
151,0.97,867.633,884.149,The assumption that after that length of time that PDA will sustain operations on its assets or will reevaluate how much we provide to support those positions?,47,,
152,0.97,884.149,891.79,My recollection is that the initiative is silent on the next steps.,48,,
153,0.97,891.79,909.141,It could be presumably either the organization or the PDA could become self sustaining using other funding or city council could choose to provide ongoing funding either in support of the organization or for projects.,48,,
154,0.97,909.141,919.852,I don't believe that the initiative is explicit about what happens after that 18 month period is over.,48,,
155,0.97,919.852,920.085,Okay.,49,,
156,0.97,920.085,928.227,I don't think I have a follow up at this time to that but appreciate that answer.,49,,

162,0.97,946.578,952.618,"Councilmember Lewis, is that a new hand or an old hand?",50,,

180,0.97,1026.992,1054.72,This land was occupied for several decades by the United States military and eventually Regranted back to a public Nonmilitary local use in 1898 and turned into a park in 1972 after continuing to be a place of the 20th century.,55,,
181,0.97,1054.72,1059.725,It is a unique space that accounts for roughly a quarter of our natural open space.,55,,
