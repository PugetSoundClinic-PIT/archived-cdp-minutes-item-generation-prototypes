61,0.97,370.069,371.27,. I'm sorry for the confusion.,22,,

65,0.97,404.804,414.981,The city needs to take a solid look at the bridges that go over the waterways and audible.,23,,
66,0.97,414.981,422.622,Those are expensive things to fix.,23,,
67,0.97,422.622,443.609,"If they malfunction they create a lot of problems for everyone, the Coast Guard rules the waterways on the West Seattle bridge and if a bridge gets stuck and cannot go up the city would be forced to Decommission it to clear space for the Maritime industry.",23,,
68,0.97,443.609,453.352,I think the estimate is around 271 million and close to 5 billion excuse me 500 million to build a new bridge.,23,,
69,0.97,453.352,464.33,So these things are really expensive and we need a fully based program to do them over the next 10 to 15 years which might require funding and stuff like that.,23,,
70,0.97,464.33,472.471,Is different than building like the railroad bridge where you go over solid plan.,23,,
71,0.97,472.471,500.166,So while it looks like you want to ramp on funding for this I think you could use next year to create a new category for bridges and also we would like to see you start on an EIS for the [inaudible] bridge.,23,,

84,0.97,607.974,610.009,"It is important for social justice, education and economic development.",27,,

118,0.97,883.983,887.019,It is a race and social justice issue and the pandemic has intensified this.,34,,
119,0.97,887.019,903.002,Much of our data is related to the 2018 information but we know with Covid-19 things have intensified.,34,,
120,0.97,903.969,910.876,We work to embrace Digital equity and it has been a part of our culture and will continue to be part of the solution as we look forward to economic recovery.,34,,
121,0.97,910.876,921.72,Before we get started in the mechanics of our report I want to remind us of the areas we are continuing to focus on.,35,,
122,0.97,921.72,931.73,We are looking for avenues to advance Digital equity and many are in play.,35,,
123,0.97,931.73,932.932,We have a Tech matching fund.,35,,
124,0.97,932.932,948.147,We are looking at how to provide public Internet access and we continue to promote Low- cost Internet outreach.,35,,
125,0.97,948.147,954.687,We have Digital bridge which is a new initiative for unemployed workers and we are Partnering with many agencies and highlight for example the library as initiating a Hotspot program.,35,,
126,0.97,954.687,983.282,"Just to add a little more context and remind ourselves that this is been an issue the city has championed for many years, I want us to remind ourselves how far we have come and where we need to go.",36,,
127,0.97,983.282,989.788,"If you looked at this chart, you see that we have made substantial pride just as progress over the years.",36,,
128,0.97,989.788,993.092,2000 was 18% and now we are about 95% this does not mean we are done.,36,,
129,0.97,993.092,994.593,It shows that we have more to do.,36,,
130,0.97,994.593,998.998,We are moving to Internet adoption.,36,,
131,0.97,998.998,1008.907,"So, how do we help? I think it is important to understand our current state.",37,,
132,0.97,1008.907,1021.32,The first pieces that we are well connected city.,37,,
133,0.97,1021.32,1023.122,"If you look, 95% of households have Internet access.",37,,
134,0.97,1023.122,1025.124,"We have moved the needle, especially from 2013 to 2018.",37,,
135,0.97,1025.124,1035.634,We still have adoption gaps.,37,,
136,0.97,1036.402,1040.539,"These are in concentrated geographic areas and we also found that this is explained by Affordability, not necessarily infrastructure.",37,,
137,0.97,1040.539,1047.112,When we look at who is impacted by this 5% of these House come into play.,37,,
138,0.97,1047.112,1049.114,These are the people we are trying to reach.,37,,
139,0.97,1049.114,1072.871,As it relates to the finding--the 5% of households without Internet these are Affordability challenges and not infrastructure.,38,,
140,0.97,1072.871,1091.323,I just want to flag that I have worked with constituents in the past where it definitely was an infrastructure issue and we worked with Comcast and century link and they wanted tens of thousands of dollars to connect certain homes.,38,,
141,0.97,1091.323,1106.071,"So I'm just wondering, does this analysis only cover the gap in access to Internet for people for whom there is at Affordability issue?",38,,
142,0.97,1106.071,1113.912,Does it include those pockets throughout the city where there is an infrastructure issue if there is no access?,38,,
143,0.97,1113.912,1123.622,You will see targeted recommendation asking us to look at specific areas to address an issue.,39,,
144,0.97,1123.622,1124.623,Okay.,40,,
145,0.97,1124.623,1124.957,Thank you.,40,,
146,0.97,1124.957,1150.716,"Now, looking at where the gaps are, I just want to highlight some of the key characteristics of those groups.",41,,
147,0.97,1150.716,1162.961,We find that low income is a very predominant--high indicator of homes without Internet access.,41,,
148,0.97,1162.961,1164.73,Some of these other areas are not mutually exclusive.,41,,
149,0.97,1164.73,1166.665,These are some traits about households without Internet access.,41,,
150,0.97,1166.665,1181.847,"Older adults, those with disabilities or those with English as not there first and language.",41,,
151,0.97,1181.847,1183.582,These households may struggle with having Internet at home.,41,,
152,0.97,1183.582,1188.253,"We found a direct correlation between income, those over 50,000 does not have an Internet access issue.",41,,
153,0.97,1188.253,1198.997,"Those with lower incomes, especially under 25,000 do tend to have adoption issues.",41,,
154,0.97,1198.997,1225.624,"Again, I want to highlight that we're seeing the gap in specific geographic areas.",42,,
155,0.97,1225.624,1227.659,Part of this analysis is helping to inform our strategies.,42,,
156,0.97,1227.659,1237.236,"When we look at the areas that we see in Seattle, these are the areas that are having the highest issues with Internet adoption.",42,,
157,0.97,1237.236,1257.756,"So south-central Seattle, Pioneer square, the International district, new Holly, Rainier Valley, beacon Hill, love Seattle and areas of downtown and Lake city.",42,,
158,0.97,1257.756,1260.559,You will see those areas highlighted in the light blue on the map.,42,,
159,0.97,1260.559,1263.261,"Again, this information can be used as we develop our strategy.",42,,
160,0.97,1263.261,1292.891,I want to take a moment and look at the feedback that we got from households without Internet access.,43,,
161,0.97,1292.891,1297.763,"This informs our strategy that when you look at the struggles that people are having without Internet access, these are the barriers most commonly cited.",43,,
162,0.97,1297.763,1299.364,Many indicate the primary barrier is cost.,43,,
163,0.97,1299.364,1301.199,Some do not have a device to access the Internet.,43,,
164,0.97,1301.199,1302.768,Others site credit or deposit requirements.,43,,
165,0.97,1302.768,1321.319,We have a group that simply doesn't know how to use the technology or they say the Internet is too slow or they don't trust it.,43,,
166,0.97,1321.319,1324.723,One thing that we are finding is that it is not just about a single factor.,43,,
167,0.97,1324.723,1335.534,To solve this problem you need to take a collection of these items and solve for all.,43,,
168,0.97,1335.534,1340.205,It does not matter if you have access and don't know how to use the technology or you may Únot have a device.,43,,
169,0.97,1340.205,1342.107,Some solutions look at things Holistically.,43,,
170,0.97,1342.107,1363.962,"In the report what we do is outline the gaps, then we move toward how do we plan our action items?",44,,
171,0.97,1363.962,1368.233,I want to highlight that this is a collection of many people's input and organizations.,44,,
172,0.97,1368.233,1387.352,"On the top bar, we will hear a little bit from Delia about those partnerships.",44,,
173,0.97,1387.352,1391.189,"We need to reach out to the city of Seattle, many departments, the schools, Community-Based organizations and private sectors.",44,,
174,0.97,1391.189,1393.058,This center of the chart reflects our North Star.,44,,
175,0.97,1393.058,1394.659,The school districts and their work is very important.,44,,
176,0.97,1394.659,1399.297,We can do this to support them.,44,,
177,0.97,1399.297,1406.638,We look forward to the universal Internet adoption.,44,,
178,0.97,1406.638,1421.62,We know we need to focus on increasing the adoption rate specifically for those with annual incomes under 25.,44,,
179,0.97,1421.62,1423.288,Who represents the bar on the bottom.,44,,
180,0.97,1423.288,1435.066,"Students, Jobseekers, low income, those are the people that need our help.",44,,
181,0.97,1436.168,1437.536,"Delia, can you share about our partnerships?",44,,
182,0.97,1437.536,1437.803,Sure.,45,,
183,0.97,1437.803,1438.103,Thank you.,45,,
184,0.97,1438.103,1439.938,Partnerships have been essential over the years.,46,,
185,0.97,1439.938,1442.941,We look forward to deepening these relationships.,46,,
186,0.97,1442.941,1451.016,The private sector has been a great partner funding and in donating equipment and lending technical expertise to project.,46,,
187,0.97,1451.016,1462.26,Philanthropy plays a role and we want to align with new initiatives coming forward.,46,,
188,0.97,1462.26,1477.275,"Anchor institution like the public schools and public library may have been key partners in helping us reach those residents, students and families who are the most organization.",46,,
189,0.97,1477.275,1493.358,There are trusted ambassadors to deliver services to our most vulnerable . We have dealt with 360 groups through this program.,47,,
190,0.97,1493.358,1496.795,We work with King County and the state of Washington.,47,,
191,0.97,1496.795,1505.971,We have the community technology advisory board and the Digital equity learning network.,47,,
192,0.97,1505.971,1508.406,"Now, I will pass this over to Mary Kay.",47,,
193,0.97,1508.406,1517.582,This slide points to lessons learned.,48,,
194,0.97,1517.582,1539.137,It asks us to's study cities [inaudible] we looked at recent news . Broadband and fiber systems Seattle and national studies.,48,,
195,0.97,1539.137,1547.546,"In the Digital equity plans of several major cities, the lessons learned align with our actions between what you see on the slide.",48,,
196,0.97,1547.546,1558.957,"Prioritized residence with lower incomes, provide programs and skills training and reduce sign up errors and ensure residents connect with available resources.",48,,
197,0.97,1558.957,1564.362,On the screen you will see the symbol for the National Trailblazers.,48,,
198,0.97,1564.362,1571.369,This is one of 15 cities to receive this for advancing Broadband access.,48,,
199,0.97,1571.369,1586.217,High Internet adoption rate and sustained Digital history work it is recommended to use a Micro approach and [inaudible] Tracy will present how we developed the action plan.,48,,
200,0.97,1586.217,1587.986,Thank you.,49,,
201,0.97,1587.986,1589.087,Thank you.,50,,
202,0.97,1589.087,1597.762,So we heard from Delia and Dan.,51,,
203,0.97,1597.762,1609.107,As we put up our action plan we wanted to leverage lessons learned and cultivate partnerships with internal and external Stakeholders and use this information to formulate our action plan.,51,,
204,0.97,1609.107,1622.153,"We are focused, when we look at the gaps we focus on geographic areas.",51,,
205,0.97,1622.153,1624.189,We take advantage of infrastructure and look at the root cause.,51,,
206,0.97,1624.189,1627.492,"Again, we are looking for Holistic look when we put together our action plans.",51,,
207,0.97,1627.492,1637.736,I'm sorry.,52,,
208,0.97,1645.577,1656.154,What we are going to do now is we have eight action plan strategies.,52,,
209,0.97,1656.154,1661.96,What we will do is look at these individually with a couple of examples so you get a flavor of how we plan to proceed with addressing Internet for all.,52,,
210,0.97,1661.96,1676.775,I want to then hear from Alice on a couple of preferred strategies.,52,,
211,0.97,1676.775,1677.175,Good morning.,53,,
212,0.97,1677.175,1700.298,I am going to speak to our first two strategies which is areas where the city has been doing a lot of work over the years and has made a big contribution as to why we are up to 95% adoption rate.,53,,
213,0.97,1700.298,1703.401,These areas will help us close the Digital divide and we will continue to emphasize them.,53,,
214,0.97,1703.401,1706.771,First we want to raise awareness of programs for Low- cost access to Internet service and devices.,53,,
215,0.97,1706.771,1711.509,As you can see from our 2018 Tech access ready when we had 53% awareness response rates for these programs.,53,,
216,0.97,1711.509,1739.17,This is something where gove it has really helped us since gove and there has been Ramped up efforts with the Community- based partners who have always been our partners as well as the office of Cable communications to make sure that clients who have intensified needs for Connectivity are getting support to sign up for low-cost programs.,53,,
217,0.97,1739.17,1754.085,This includes collaboration we have done with public schools and helping them set up [inaudible] so they can sponsor some low cost programs for the household so the household doesn't have to pay six months initially.,53,,
218,0.97,1754.085,1761.459,A lot of good work has been done.,53,,
219,0.97,1761.459,1764.229,We have people know about and adopt these programs to have services and devices.,53,,
220,0.97,1764.229,1771.836,We know the low-cost service programs are not a perfect solution for people who don't have stable housing.,53,,
221,0.97,1771.836,1773.872,That is because the programs require a Wireline connection.,53,,
222,0.97,1773.872,1790.889,The Digital equity study told us that we have a lot of people that require connections they need a mobile option for Connectivity.,53,,
223,0.97,1790.889,1798.263,That pushes us toward our second strategy which is a focus on expanding public Wi-Fi available.,53,,
224,0.97,1798.263,1801.833,Particularly we will focus on the Digital equity areas that were mentioned earlier in the presentation.,53,,
225,0.97,1801.833,1811.109,You have identified research and we think these are areas where we can expand public Wi- Fi and it will have the greatest community impact.,53,,
226,0.97,1811.109,1825.623,"We are going to, as a more immediate activity, have the public libraries deploy [inaudible] outside their branches.",53,,
227,0.97,1825.623,1836.434,"We're going to look strategically throughout the city and the community centers where we already have internal Connectivity, how we might make that external.",53,,
228,0.97,1836.434,1838.836,Through partnerships there could be infrastructure in the area.,53,,
229,0.97,1838.836,1857.522,Thank you.,54,,
230,0.97,1857.522,1882.413,"Looking ahead to strategy number 3, we have partnered with organizations . This strategy really reflects how we are continuing to partner with organizations to include and provide Digital inclusion programs.",54,,
231,0.97,1882.413,1886.985,"Some examples that we have here are to continue our programs, for example the Digital bridge.",54,,
232,0.97,1886.985,1908.906,"That also recognizes that we have in a Holistic model, that we need to have with train the Trainer model so we provide not only the access, the additional skills needed as well to provide a complete picture for residents the need Internet access.",54,,
233,0.97,1908.906,1913.611,There is a Digital navigator suggestion as part of the action plan.,54,,
234,0.97,1913.611,1934.999,Strategy number 4 regards private sector . We have seen a great out reach with business and technology communities about Wating to help.,54,,
235,0.97,1934.999,1938.469,We need to partner with these organization to secure the support we need for Internet for all.,54,,
236,0.97,1938.469,1940.438,There has been tremendous positive engagement from the private sector.,54,,
237,0.97,1940.438,1941.506,We thank them.,54,,
238,0.97,1941.506,1965.43,"Next, I want to highlight strategy number five.",55,,
239,0.97,1965.43,1967.265,That has to do with Championing legislation and policies.,55,,
240,0.97,1967.265,1971.336,There is much going on at the state and Federal level and we want to continue to champion those causes.,55,,
241,0.97,1971.336,1978.343,The Digital equity act is only one example and we can take a look inward as well exploring what policies we have two enable Internet access for all new affording House meant investments.,55,,
242,0.97,1978.343,1983.881,Those are just a couple of components to look at for the action plan.,55,,
243,0.97,1983.881,1985.883,Strategy number 6 looks at the regional collaboration.,55,,
244,0.97,1985.883,1993.091,We know that there has been a tremendous amount of work that has been happening all within the same geographic area.,55,,
245,0.97,1993.091,2008.606,We have much [inaudible] with community organizations.,55,,
246,0.97,2008.606,2009.507,We have city and county action.,55,,
247,0.97,2009.507,2012.51,Having a regional collaboration for these many different avenues is a recommendation in the report.,55,,
248,0.97,2012.51,2013.811,"Alice, back to you.",55,,
249,0.97,2013.811,2016.614,Okay.,56,,
250,0.97,2016.614,2026.791,Strategy number seven is working to align with the covert mitigation efforts going on to provide Connectivity.,56,,
251,0.97,2026.791,2045.576,During this time Isps are Internet service providers and telecommunication providers have stepped up and they have been great partners to help Low- cost residence for Connectivity.,56,,
252,0.97,2045.576,2055.052,One thing we do to measure our success is the Tech access study.,56,,
253,0.97,2055.052,2056.821,We don't do that except every four years.,56,,
254,0.97,2056.821,2069.634,Getting more data in the interim years about the success at these low cost adoptions will be key for us to try our process.,56,,
255,0.97,2069.634,2075.94,We will work with those carriers who have that data to try to get access to it so we can see how much success we have been getting in the Short- term.,56,,
256,0.97,2075.94,2099.964,That will help us keep our focus and strategy on where there could be gaps . Another focus area is that during covert we have had some successful outcomes.,56,,
257,0.97,2099.964,2102.5,One is a low-cost Internet program provided by the city prior to March.,56,,
258,0.97,2102.5,2109.14,They offered 10 to 18 megabit service which was substandard even by Federal Login definition.,56,,
259,0.97,2109.14,2113.911,As of March it was increased to 25 megabit and they have committed to keep that as the ongoing service levels for these programs.,56,,
260,0.97,2113.911,2114.912,That is a successful outcome.,56,,
261,0.97,2114.912,2143.341,We also know that having so many people in households trying to connect at the same time has caused some service and speed can strengths and we get complaints of that.,56,,
262,0.97,2143.341,2145.61,We believe that the 25 megabit service as a baseline.,56,,
263,0.97,2145.61,2151.649,We want to have a strategy focusing on how to increase the service levels for our low-cost programs especially those with families where there are multiple users in the household.,56,,
264,0.97,2151.649,2174.272,"And our next strategy, this is what you were saying about the pockets we have in the city where there have not been Wireline connections or it has not been upgraded to give someone wired Connectivity.",56,,
265,0.97,2174.272,2178.476,We need to constantly track new technologies or merging to offer Internet service specifically and increase the capacity of existing services.,56,,
266,0.97,2178.476,2179.944,There is a lot going on here.,56,,
267,0.97,2179.944,2184.982,Here are some on the slide.,56,,
268,0.97,2184.982,2201.265,We talk about it in the report but these are opportunities we think are important to consider to help us with the Micro targeting when we find specific need areas.,56,,
269,0.97,2204.569,2207.004,One solution would work in one area but not necessarily another.,56,,
270,0.97,2207.004,2211.208,"For example if there is not Wireline Connectivity, maybe a block that was not built out and is now expensive to do.",56,,
271,0.97,2211.208,2221.052,The solution is a fixed Wireless or increased satellite Internet as those options are improving.,56,,
272,0.97,2221.052,2230.695,We will continue to track those and it is an important part of the Ecosystem of the Internet to always be aware of innovation going on and closely monitor that and align it as the needs become greater and we become aware of those situations.,56,,
273,0.97,2230.695,2231.729,"Tracy, back to you.",57,,
274,0.97,2231.729,2232.129,Thank you.,58,,
275,0.97,2232.129,2269.767,"For quick wrap up, I want to highlight some of the Timeline and milestones . So our work has been in 2020 really, we have put energy and effort into the report with an emphasis to gap analysis.",59,,
276,0.97,2269.767,2270.768,We continue to support the schools.,59,,
277,0.97,2270.768,2274.338,"We are continuing our private partnership and community engagement with different organizations and again, fostering those conditions.",59,,
278,0.97,2274.338,2275.74,That is work underway and will continue.,59,,
279,0.97,2275.74,2284.382,"In 2021 we will provide an update and a little more explanation on evaluation outcomes, for example.",59,,
280,0.97,2284.382,2289.787,"And then, again, continuing to provide updates and partner on how we develop Internet for all.",59,,
281,0.97,2289.787,2300.398,"Looking ahead to 2022 and 2023, our Northstar, the data points to universal Internet adoption in those years.",59,,
282,0.97,2300.398,2316.814,We will focus on the areas of need . We want to remind households with annual incomes under 25 is a key group for us to help move the needle on.,59,,
283,0.97,2316.814,2319.083,So those are an overview of the Timeline and key milestones.,59,,
284,0.97,2319.083,2330.227,We want to have a few words from our Cto but quickly we will discuss the next steps.,59,,
285,0.97,2330.227,2335.333,"Tracy, if I may ask a question about the milestones, if you could go back to that slide, just to clarify a couple of items.",60,,
286,0.97,2335.333,2355.82,"This is important so we are measuring our success and I know the resolution also called for an evaluation of how we are doing and so, looking at our progress to goals will be important.",60,,
287,0.97,2355.82,2357.755,"I wanted to clarify the 20,000 Internet connections and divisive.",60,,
288,0.97,2357.755,2368.065,"That is 20,000 connections plus 20,000 devices?",60,,
289,0.97,2368.065,2384.548,What this will really represent is the need . I--we may have Internet connections and don't need divisive.,61,,
290,0.97,2384.548,2386.283,You may need devices but already have the connection.,61,,
291,0.97,2386.283,2393.791,Our goal will be to report back on what is required to meet the need.,61,,
292,0.97,2393.791,2394.992,That makes sense overall.,62,,
293,0.97,2394.992,2403.167,"I know you came up with the 20,000 number based partly on the 17,000+ households with the gap.",62,,
294,0.97,2403.167,2414.712,"I wanted to confirm or not that, saying 20,000 is both combining Internet connections and devices.",62,,
295,0.97,2414.712,2415.913,You are correct.,63,,
296,0.97,2415.913,2416.247,Absolutely.,63,,
297,0.97,2416.247,2423.921,There may be some overlap in there could be more in some places.,64,,
298,0.97,2423.921,2424.722,Thank you.,65,,
299,0.97,2424.722,2427.658,Thank you for the question.,66,,
300,0.97,2427.658,2434.331,Did you want me to go ahead?,67,,
301,0.97,2434.331,2435.299,Sure.,68,,
302,0.97,2435.299,2445.476,Okay.,69,,
303,0.97,2448.512,2450.247,I won't take too much of your time.,69,,
304,0.97,2450.247,2451.916,Thank you for the opportunity for us to present.,69,,
305,0.97,2451.916,2473.27,I was speaking with a counterpart in another city in the United States and speaking about this report coming up and they heard the 95% mark they seemed to suggest the mission was accomplished because in their region 95 would be an aggressive target.,69,,
306,0.97,2473.27,2477.274,"I said to that person and I am sharing it with you, for the us this remains a work in process.",69,,
307,0.97,2477.274,2486.65,We are challenging ourselves that we won't stop on what we need to do to bring that number down to zero.,69,,
308,0.97,2486.65,2493.757,"The more you can put us on the spot and expect that we come back to you with regular updates on some of the work we have put in front of you, the better.",69,,
309,0.97,2493.757,2503.0,Now we need to do some Microlevel targeted strategies because we are talking about a very small chunk of Seattle that have specific needs.,69,,
310,0.97,2503.0,2514.278,Our strategies and tactics will need to align with those.,69,,
311,0.97,2514.278,2516.714,"With that, any questions that you have I will be happy to take.",69,,
312,0.97,2516.714,2517.014,Thank you.,69,,
313,0.97,2517.014,2517.715,Thank you.,70,,
314,0.97,2517.715,2526.824,"Councilmembers, any questions for Seattle information technology or their service?",71,,
315,0.97,2526.824,2531.729,"I know you may have questions, feel free to ask them at any time but if you have any questions now, they are welcome.",72,,
316,0.97,2531.729,2534.798,Councilmember morale ask?,73,,
317,0.97,2534.798,2535.399,Thank you.,74,,
318,0.97,2535.399,2536.634,I do want to thank this team.,74,,
319,0.97,2536.634,2548.946,I know this is layered and complex and a huge undertaking.,74,,
320,0.97,2550.514,2555.719,I appreciate the work that has gone into this report and the work that you are doing to try to reach out to the community.,74,,
321,0.97,2555.719,2572.169,"Have to say that I feel a little frustrated because what I hear you say is that there is a small percentage of our community that has, for many different reasons has trouble Accessing the Internet.",74,,
322,0.97,2572.169,2607.705,"I am sure a lot of that is language, Portability and lacking infrastructure, lacking in understanding of how the Internet works set of at all and it seems Counterintuitive to me that the answer to that problem is to suggest research on assorted technologies, different needs, different programs and initiatives and I'm not sure how that solves the problem of speaking from my district and particular, community that has layers of challenges.",74,,
323,0.97,2607.705,2622.92,It seems to me that a more Holistic and more uniform approach would make it easier.,74,,
324,0.97,2622.92,2626.023,There would be one thing to explain and one way to access and pay for things.,74,,
325,0.97,2626.023,2629.393,That is to move toward making this a public utility.,74,,
326,0.97,2629.393,2633.664,I know that is a different conversation.,74,,
327,0.97,2633.664,2652.116,"I just want to say that speaking for district 2 who have many of the challenges you are talking about, offering a menu of different things to different people does not seem like the right approach to solving the problem.",74,,
328,0.97,2652.116,2656.186,Umass P2: quickly?,75,,
329,0.97,2656.186,2674.738,So this presentation did definitely emphasize the service access portion of it.,76,,
330,0.97,2674.738,2686.884,Our work definitely has been Holistic in looking at Digital equity as being access to the Internet and how to use a device and the applications on that device.,76,,
331,0.97,2686.884,2698.996,A lot of that type of work is with Community-Based organizations so that is part of it and you will see more of that in the report . It is a key focus for us.,76,,
332,0.97,2698.996,2703.4,One program we stood up in the last few months was also economic development and the jobs development.,76,,
333,0.97,2703.4,2704.201,It's called Digital bridge.,76,,
334,0.97,2704.201,2722.486,"It is giving them a device, one on one skills training . We have work . We know where the profound need is.",76,,
335,0.97,2722.486,2724.054,Giving them a Hotspot is just the beginning.,76,,
336,0.97,2724.054,2741.338,It is a lot of hard One-On-One work often to help with other solutions . that is why this city has to align community organizations who work with those residents and know their specific needs and languages so some strategies support organizations at that level.,76,,
337,0.97,2741.338,2743.04,I can also build on that.,77,,
338,0.97,2743.04,2749.913,There was a slide there that showed six different reasons why there are those gaps that exist.,77,,
339,0.97,2749.913,2759.757,One of them was about the device and others said they don't know how to get Internet access.,77,,
340,0.97,2759.757,2770.134,"The point to make is that when we talk about strategies, we are talking about a Holistic strategy for each one of those areas.",77,,
341,0.97,2770.134,2781.345,The last thing we want to do is confuse the person on the other end that is looking for help by telling them there are 10 different types of options that they don't know how to choose from.,77,,
342,0.97,2781.345,2789.353,Is simple solution . do it Holistically for each one of those.,77,,
343,0.97,2789.353,2797.594,Thank you for that question.,78,,
344,0.97,2797.594,2809.206,I know when the Mayor submits her budget we will look carefully at how the dollars are allocated so we can close the Digital divide.,78,,
345,0.97,2809.206,2814.144,You mentioned in your slide that strategy of training the Trainers and getting people more comfortable with the devices.,78,,
346,0.97,2814.144,2823.62,It has to be competent and there will be language barriers that need to be overcome.,78,,
347,0.97,2823.62,2872.769,"If that means that we need to fund more community groups that already have those connections and speak those languages to get to expand this access and adoption, that is something we could also handle during the budget process even though we are facing massive budget deficits . If we spend our money wisely I am hoping we can move the needle forward and meet these milestones and you will be back to our Committee in a few months as well so we will have the full budget process and then you will come back so we can see how the progress is going and decide whether we need to focus on other paths as well.",78,,
348,0.97,2872.769,2873.337,Okay.,79,,
349,0.97,2873.337,2875.672,Any final questions while they are here?,79,,
350,0.97,2875.672,2881.078,Okay.,80,,
351,0.97,2881.078,2883.747,I would like to thank everybody from the Mayor's office for your hard work.,80,,
352,0.97,2883.747,2901.999,Now that hard work will continue to actually implement this but we appreciate the cooperation and collaboration on this effort and we will continue to ask the tough questions and try to move the needle forward on this.,80,,
353,0.97,2901.999,2902.866,"Thank you, very much.",80,,
354,0.97,2902.866,2903.9,Thank you.,81,,
355,0.97,2903.9,2907.304,Okay.,82,,
356,0.97,2907.304,2915.212,We are on to item 2. with the clerk please read item 2,82,,
357,0.97,2915.212,2926.823,"Presentation by Seattle office of the city auditor, strategic approach to vehicle bridge mains is warranted.",83,,
358,0.97,2926.823,2927.224,Thank you.,84,,
359,0.97,2927.224,2929.76,So we have with us the city auditor.,85,,
360,0.97,2929.76,2941.838,"For the people viewing, the city auditor is part of the legislative branch of governor meant.",85,,
361,0.97,2941.838,2979.109,They have something similar with the General Accounting office and it is very useful and important to help the city Council and the legislative branch look into things going on in the executive branch and with a $6.5 billion budget there's lots to look at and we--this report was after the questions came up about how are the other bridges doing and what are the physical conditions?,85,,
362,0.97,2979.109,2980.577,Is there something we should do differently?,85,,
363,0.97,2980.577,2985.082,I want to thank the Council president for enabling this as well.,85,,
364,0.97,2985.082,2986.983,Lisa has been very involved with the Seattle bridge.,85,,
365,0.97,2986.983,3004.001,"In this report, there have been radio reports about this already.",85,,
366,0.97,3004.001,3006.003,We are eager to hear directly from the city auditor today.,85,,
367,0.97,3006.003,3010.107,The Department of transportation cooperated very much on this report and concurs with these recommendations in this audit report.,85,,
368,0.97,3010.107,3013.51,We will hear a little bit from them as well.,85,,
369,0.97,3013.51,3015.779,I will turn it over to our city auditor David G Jones.,85,,
370,0.97,3015.779,3029.893,Thank you Councilmember Pederson.,86,,
371,0.97,3029.893,3032.429,I want to thank you for making a request for this audit.,86,,
372,0.97,3032.429,3033.63,I think it is a timely topic.,86,,
373,0.97,3033.63,3035.599,So thank you for bringing it to our office.,86,,
374,0.97,3035.599,3048.045,"I want to tell the viewing public, if you want to see a copy of the report you can see it through the agenda . It is also available in our office at the Website which is WWW ..",86,,
375,0.97,3048.045,3048.612,Seattle.Gov/City auditor.,86,,
376,0.97,3048.612,3053.95,Now I will turn it over to the people who really did the work on the audit.,86,,
377,0.97,3053.95,3062.259,I would be Remiss if I did not think Melissa Alderson for her work on this and also Luisa Mota's Auntie who helped on this audit.,86,,
378,0.97,3062.259,3064.061,Many thanks for getting this done.,86,,
379,0.97,3064.061,3074.738,As you said in a really quick and timely manner.,86,,
380,0.97,3074.738,3078.141,You needed the Council for budget so I will turn it over now to Sean and Jane.,86,,
381,0.97,3078.141,3079.743,"Thank you, David.",87,,
382,0.97,3079.743,3100.297,Good morning for the record my name is Shawn the bleak I am with the office of city auditor.,87,,
383,0.97,3100.297,3102.699,"My colleague, Jane and I will provide highlights from the audit of bridges.",87,,
384,0.97,3102.699,3106.736,This was prompted over concerns about the bridge portfolio following the emergency closure of the West Seattle high bridge.,87,,
385,0.97,3106.736,3120.417,"Let me make it clear that our audit was not an investigation into the specifics of that bridge, instead the investments we have a city have made in the maintenance and recommendations for the D.O.T.",87,,
386,0.97,3120.417,3122.986,To take and preserve and protect our transportation system.,87,,
387,0.97,3122.986,3136.633,The three key Takeaways of our audit are listed here.,88,,
388,0.97,3136.633,3140.036,"First, based on condition, the bridge portfolio is similar to other cities in the United States.",88,,
389,0.97,3140.036,3143.54,"Since most of the nations bridges are aging, this is not a great place to be.",88,,
390,0.97,3143.54,3163.793,We found we are spending the amount set on bridge maintenance.,88,,
391,0.97,3163.793,3167.931,The amount needed for the upkeep of bridges is far greater than what the city has set aside for these purposes.,88,,
392,0.97,3167.931,3175.739,"Third, we have several recommendations to address to help us shift to a more Reactive approach and establish what experts call a strategic bridge preservation program.",88,,
393,0.97,3175.739,3182.979,"Before giving this to change, we are taking steps in that direction has concurred with our recommendations.",88,,
394,0.97,3182.979,3189.853,Jane?,89,,
395,0.97,3189.853,3190.086,Yes.,90,,
396,0.97,3190.086,3190.687,Good morning.,90,,
397,0.97,3190.687,3192.489,So this next slide shows what we have looked at.,90,,
398,0.97,3192.489,3195.058,There were 77 vehicle bridge that we own and maintain.,90,,
399,0.97,3195.058,3211.274,"S.Speaks about having 124 bridges but that includes bridges with pedestrian bridges, tunnels, shorter than 20 feet and those joined with other jurisdictions.",90,,
400,0.97,3211.274,3214.21,That is a difference there.,90,,
401,0.97,3214.21,3219.049,Another technical notice that we used Federal highway administration.,90,,
402,0.97,3219.049,3229.526,National bridge inventory.,90,,
403,0.97,3232.796,3237.334,Sometimes they count bridges based on engineering components so they might count what we would consider one bridge as 2.,90,,
404,0.97,3237.334,3244.174,In this they counted the University bridge as to bridges.,90,,
405,0.97,3244.174,3250.347,"We found 22 in good condition and five in poor, those are essentially four.",90,,
406,0.97,3250.347,3255.819,"Fairview Avenue North which is being replaced, magnolia and the University bridge.",90,,
407,0.97,3255.819,3269.666,And as we saw in the last slide most vehicular bridges--excuse me.,91,,
408,0.97,3269.666,3270.467,We have a question.,91,,
409,0.97,3270.467,3270.967,Thank you.,92,,
410,0.97,3270.967,3291.221,"Jane, my question is on slide 3. this is very helpful for us to understand which bridges within the city are in good fare in poor condition and we are already intervening in some of the poor conditioned areas.",93,,
411,0.97,3291.221,3309.105,When we chatted yesterday we discussed how the Minneapolis bridge was in fair condition and the bridge on Interstate 5 was also in fair condition and they collapse.,93,,
412,0.97,3309.105,3310.44,That was due to an external variables.,93,,
413,0.97,3310.44,3319.616,There was construction load and occurring and of Rush-Hour traffic and an oversized truck struck one of the structural beams and the other.,93,,
414,0.97,3319.616,3334.664,"When we are looking at these bridges, is it your sense that without an external variable these bridges that are in fair condition, as long as they receive inspection, should be fine?",93,,
415,0.97,3334.664,3338.335,"Sean, do you want to take that question?",94,,
416,0.97,3338.335,3338.668,Shortly.,95,,
417,0.97,3338.668,3339.335,Thank you.,96,,
418,0.97,3339.335,3351.147,I would--the data are not granule enough to make that determination that you are suggestion.,96,,
419,0.97,3351.147,3352.949,We would need to have ongoing you can inspections.,96,,
420,0.97,3352.949,3359.422,They are required to be inspected at least every two years and summer inspected more frequently.,96,,
421,0.97,3359.422,3367.664,Using the data to determine what needs to be replaced or fixed would not be a good idea.,96,,
422,0.97,3367.664,3377.841,Great.,97,,
423,0.97,3378.241,3378.775,Thank you so much.,97,,
424,0.97,3378.775,3387.15,"I guess my question was also highlighting the fact that even if we have a bridge that is in fair condition if an external variable comes into play, we could see the bridge having some Stencil problems like what happened.",97,,
425,0.97,3387.15,3400.697,"Looking at the fourth Avenue South bridge, how do we determine the length of use that bridge has?",97,,
426,0.97,3400.697,3403.767,You do that by a very Fine- grained analysis of the bridge is useful lights.,98,,
427,0.97,3403.767,3409.606,"The original design, the age of the bridge has an impact.",98,,
428,0.97,3409.606,3421.384,There is not a direct correlation.,98,,
429,0.97,3423.486,3427.123,We need to update the useful life of bridges based on current condition data down to the component level.,98,,
430,0.97,3427.123,3428.324,That is how you do it.,98,,
431,0.97,3428.324,3430.527,You inspect them by component and look at it that way.,98,,
432,0.97,3430.527,3431.394,Is that helpful?,99,,
433,0.97,3431.394,3433.429,"Sean, do you want to add anything to that?",100,,
434,0.97,3433.429,3433.83,No.,101,,
435,0.97,3433.83,3434.798,Okay.,102,,
436,0.97,3434.798,3436.199,I'm sorry.,102,,
437,0.97,3436.199,3440.503,Go ahead.,102,,
438,0.97,3440.503,3441.137,Thank you.,103,,
439,0.97,3441.137,3452.649,"Not another question, very response to the earlier observation from the fair rated bridges.",103,,
440,0.97,3452.649,3462.859,The West Seattle bridge was rated fair.,103,,
441,0.97,3462.859,3464.661,Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure.,103,,
442,0.97,3464.661,3465.328,You are correct.,104,,
443,0.97,3465.328,3486.983,"So when we recommend looking at the bridges in a more granule or component I think what we will find, one hypothesis is that the 50 bridges in fair condition, some of those show a more immediate need to address a concern.",104,,
444,0.97,3486.983,3497.794,Absent an external involvement as customer Strauss was pointing out.,105,,
445,0.97,3497.794,3498.995,Yes.,106,,
446,0.97,3498.995,3513.243,"Jane and Sean, is that your understanding when you do a component by component analysis, some of the bridges in broader, fair condition may need more immediate repair?",107,,
447,0.97,3513.243,3514.978,That is certainly possible.,108,,
448,0.97,3514.978,3515.512,Yes.,109,,
449,0.97,3515.512,3523.319,"Councilmember Pederson, may I speak for a quick moment?",110,,
450,0.97,3523.319,3527.724,Yes.,111,,
451,0.97,3527.724,3531.928,Ahead.,111,,
452,0.97,3531.928,3539.002,I just wanted to add to what was said.,111,,
453,0.97,3539.002,3543.006,We have an inspection frequency for all of the bridges and that is where we get these ratings and results.,111,,
454,0.97,3543.006,3562.258,When we see things that give us concern or create an inability for the bridges to not carry the traffic or load they are carrying.,111,,
455,0.97,3562.258,3562.759,We take action.,111,,
456,0.97,3562.759,3566.863,I just wanted to point out that if we saw anything in the inspection we would take action on them.,111,,
457,0.97,3566.863,3589.986,"And I think for this discussion we will have the auditor run through their entire report and then if there are any comments at the end, just know things during the presentation and we can hear from S.D.O.T.",112,,
458,0.97,3589.986,3592.255,And we can wrap it all up at the very end.,112,,
459,0.97,3592.255,3593.189,"Please continue, Shawna Jane.",113,,
460,0.97,3593.189,3593.89,Thank you.,114,,
461,0.97,3593.89,3594.29,Okay.,115,,
462,0.97,3594.29,3620.083,"So as we noted, the regular bridges are in fair condition but this is not necessarily good news as many are old.",115,,
463,0.97,3620.083,3623.219,"In fact, the median age of the 77 vehicular bridges we analyzed is 70 years.",115,,
464,0.97,3623.219,3625.788,Summer reaching the end of their expected life and will need more costly repairs.,115,,
465,0.97,3625.788,3627.824,Also things of gotten worse in the last nine years.,115,,
466,0.97,3627.824,3629.425,15 bridges worsened in condition only six improve.,115,,
467,0.97,3629.425,3647.81,"This slide, for context we compared Seattle with others that have similar populations, bridge issues or geographic challenges.",116,,
468,0.97,3647.81,3651.347,The take away is that we are not an Outlier in terms of the bridge portfolio.,116,,
469,0.97,3651.347,3662.525,This is not necessarily good news.,116,,
470,0.97,3665.428,3667.096,Many jurisdictions nationwide have unfunded bridge maintenance needs.,116,,
471,0.97,3667.096,3674.203,"In fact, the highway administration estimates that of the 614,000 public bridges in the United States an annual investment of 24.6 billion is needed to eliminate the backlog of bridge maintenance by the year 2032.",116,,
472,0.97,3674.203,3675.138,This is a national issue.,116,,
473,0.97,3675.138,3689.952,"For this slide, we go back to S.D.O.T.",117,,
474,0.97,3689.952,3690.586,And their maintenance.,117,,
475,0.97,3690.586,3693.523,We examined and compared the budget given for bridge maintenance and what they spend.,117,,
476,0.97,3693.523,3697.06,The Orange line in the graph is the actual expenditures in the blue line is the budget.,117,,
477,0.97,3697.06,3710.139,The purpose of this is to show that for the most part they spend what is allocated.,117,,
478,0.97,3722.085,3722.819,There are two exceptions.,117,,
479,0.97,3722.819,3724.987,One example is under spending in 2008 but overspending in 2009.,117,,
480,0.97,3724.987,3729.859,This was a planned cycle as a save of funds from one year to use on the next year on a large project.,117,,
481,0.97,3729.859,3730.827,That is just a big suspected.,117,,
482,0.97,3730.827,3733.563,The other exception is 2016 to 2018 where they under spent their budget.,117,,
483,0.97,3733.563,3737.266,They told us that was because they did not have enough staff hours needed to complete the work.,117,,
484,0.97,3737.266,3753.95,"For context, the division responsible for bridge maintenance has 51 employees including the director, supervisors, managers and administrative staff as well as engineers and maintenance crews.",117,,
485,0.97,3753.95,3756.219,They also have bridge operators that do not do maintenance work.,117,,
486,0.97,3756.219,3770.166,"These employees are responsible for stairways, fairways, review of construction permits and assisting with transportation related emergency response.",117,,
487,0.97,3770.166,3776.038,We will talk more about the impact of this work and other work done for external parties later in this presentation.,117,,
488,0.97,3776.038,3781.711,Go ahead Councilmember Herbold,118,,
489,0.97,3781.711,3801.497,It is my recollection that the spending plan puts limits on allocations of funding according to different categories in a way that might make it more difficult to spend more money on bridge maintenance.,119,,
490,0.97,3801.497,3811.407,Did you take a look at the transportation spending plan to see about those limitations?,119,,
491,0.97,3811.407,3819.382,We did not specifically.,120,,
492,0.97,3819.382,3821.417,We looked at what was in the levy for bridges.,120,,
493,0.97,3821.417,3823.219,I don't have that figure in front of me.,120,,
494,0.97,3823.219,3824.22,We did look at that.,120,,
495,0.97,3824.22,3827.89,And at the end we can ask if she wants to address that.,121,,
496,0.97,3827.89,3833.362,That is a good question about the levy allocation.,121,,
497,0.97,3833.362,3833.996,Thank you.,122,,
498,0.97,3833.996,3834.897,Okay.,123,,
499,0.97,3834.897,3847.043,"So Finally, more funding is needing.",123,,
500,0.97,3847.043,3848.444,I don't think this is a surprise.,123,,
501,0.97,3848.444,3851.047,We just wanted to give background on how they come up with their estimates.,123,,
502,0.97,3851.047,3856.118,They use the industry rule of thumb to maintain a bridge in a state of good repair.,123,,
503,0.97,3856.118,3858.354,That is one where the bridge can operate at full level.,123,,
504,0.97,3858.354,3872.568,The industry standard is one to 3% of total replacement cost on bridge maintenance every year.,123,,
505,0.97,3872.568,3886.582,So we used the 3.4 billion replacement value for all bridges over 60 years old at 1% which is 34 million per year that we should be spending.,123,,
506,0.97,3886.582,3889.218,The average spending for the past 14 years old was 6.6 million.,123,,
507,0.97,3889.218,3896.659,So even with the most conservative estimate they need 27 million per year to keep up with bridge maintenance.,123,,
508,0.97,3896.659,3904.467,So now Sean will talk about some of the things that Gonzalez should do to make the best of the resources they may obtain.,123,,
509,0.97,3904.467,3908.304,I want to emphasize that previous slide if you don't mind going back to it.,124,,
510,0.97,3908.304,3925.988,That is the one percent figure quoted in the media so spending 6.6 million yet should be spending 34 million.,124,,
511,0.97,3925.988,3933.696,That is based on 1% but it is really one to 3% that would be the best practice and so you could be over $100 million if you did 3%.,124,,
512,0.97,3933.696,3938.801,I think that is an important point to notice that the gap is large.,124,,
513,0.97,3938.801,3939.602,Thank you.,125,,
514,0.97,3939.602,3940.903,Very good point.,126,,
515,0.97,3940.903,3944.24,Okay.,127,,
516,0.97,3944.24,3948.945,So thank you.,127,,
517,0.97,3948.945,3962.091,For the second half of the presentation I'm going to focus on key areas for S.D.O.T.,127,,
518,0.97,3963.426,3963.759,To address.,127,,
519,0.97,3963.759,3966.829,First off is laying the groundwork for using any maintenance funds efficiently and effectively.,127,,
520,0.97,3966.829,3976.972,This slide shows a deterioration curve and illustrates where investments and bridge maintenance make the most sent.,127,,
521,0.97,3976.972,3978.374,That is up in the green zone.,127,,
522,0.97,3978.374,3991.587,That makes sense because by investing in that area you can expend the useful life of the bridge.,127,,
523,0.97,3991.587,3996.292,As Jane mentioned there is a large gap between what is needed for bridge maintenance and what the city SETS aside for that.,128,,
524,0.97,3996.292,4005.601,To close that gap there needs to be knowledge of how long each major component of each bridge will last.,128,,
525,0.97,4005.601,4011.974,We lack the information in the X access.,128,,
526,0.97,4011.974,4016.846,"Without that, the city cannot program money to bridges that need the money the most.",128,,
527,0.97,4016.846,4024.954,Let me emphasize this point again.,129,,
528,0.97,4024.954,4041.337,"We note that the importance of having that information is, you need to know where to put the money you have to get the most out of it.",129,,
529,0.97,4041.337,4044.006,Our recommendation is to update useful life estimates and plan the maintenance work.,129,,
530,0.97,4044.006,4047.143,"With those items in place, develop strategies to close the funding gap.",129,,
531,0.97,4047.143,4053.649,The second item is compliance.,130,,
532,0.97,4053.649,4056.018,The inspection and maintenance practices are audited by the Federal Government.,130,,
533,0.97,4056.018,4075.07,In preparation for the next formal audit in 2023 is not Proactively invited officials to do an informal review of the bridge program this past fall.,130,,
534,0.97,4075.07,4078.007,"According to the officials that conducted that review, they found some items.",130,,
535,0.97,4078.007,4091.487,They noticed that could put us out of the running for Federal dollars and lead to administrative oversight.,130,,
536,0.97,4091.487,4094.457,So our recommendation is to address the issues identified in that informal review.,130,,
537,0.97,4094.457,4103.099,The third area where we recommend changes to be made is in regard to Reimbursable work.,131,,
538,0.97,4103.099,4111.006,This picture shows a bridge crew inspecting a bridge.,131,,
539,0.97,4111.006,4122.218,These employees have critical skills that are beneficial to other city departments and are also doing the work for the state and County.,131,,
540,0.97,4122.218,4126.689,"We found the amount of Reimbursable work is significant, 20% of the work done by the bridge maintenance is not on S.D.O.T.",131,,
541,0.97,4126.689,4127.423,Bridges.,131,,
542,0.97,4127.423,4142.938,That means less is being done and it changes the type of work being done on the bridges.,132,,
543,0.97,4142.938,4153.649,The first point is pretty Self- evident.,132,,
544,0.97,4153.649,4155.15,I'll talk more about the second.,132,,
545,0.97,4155.15,4161.023,According to officials that we spoke with maintenance crews may choose to do smaller bridge jobs in order to accommodate the time they need to do the Reimbursable work.,132,,
546,0.97,4161.023,4166.061,It's like putting the cart behind the horse.,132,,
547,0.97,4166.061,4169.565,The impact is that the work may not be done because of a timing issue with Reimbursable work.,132,,
548,0.97,4169.565,4180.843,We recommend reducing that amount of work . next slide.,132,,
549,0.97,4181.143,4184.18,The last area has to do with oversight of private bridges Úlike the one shown here.,132,,
550,0.97,4184.18,4193.222,This structure is a pedestrian bridge.,132,,
551,0.97,4193.222,4198.36,It it is not owned by the city but inspectors are required to do a safety inspection on this and other private bridges every year.,132,,
552,0.97,4198.36,4211.006,The safety of these bridges is very important but the frequency and type of inspection work is probably unnecessary given current standards and the inspections and oversight that the auto owners also provide.,132,,
553,0.97,4211.006,4236.332,"We discovered the reason this is being done annually for the bridges is not necessarily because it increases the safety of the bridges rather an old requirement from an ordinance of about 50 years ago . It is worth noting that back then, in 1968, there was very little oversight of bridges anywhere the country.",133,,
554,0.97,4236.332,4237.9,Having an ordinance like that made sense.,133,,
555,0.97,4237.9,4241.303,Our recommendation is for S.D.O.T.,133,,
556,0.97,4241.303,4244.506,To use its expertise to propose a new ordinance that makes sense for this day and age.,133,,
557,0.97,4244.506,4246.709,Okay.,134,,
558,0.97,4246.709,4246.942,--,134,,
559,0.97,4246.942,4254.516,"Pardon me, Councilmember Strauss.",135,,
560,0.97,4254.516,4258.253,I was hoping to speak to you about the private bridges slide . Yes.,136,,
561,0.97,4258.253,4258.621,This perfect.,136,,
562,0.97,4258.621,4278.841,"So I understand the newer bridges are built with a higher structural integrity but we have a number of older bridges privately owned throughout the city, I am thinking of the one on West Lake.",136,,
563,0.97,4278.841,4286.148,The property owner was not maintaining the bridge because they were deciding whether to take down the bridge or retain it.,136,,
564,0.97,4286.148,4295.791,"It was important that the inspection be remained because without proper maintenance, it was beginning to deteriorate.",136,,
565,0.97,4295.791,4308.07,Can you dashed you have recommendations as far as if there is a year the bridge was built that fewer inspections should take place?,136,,
566,0.97,4308.07,4317.813,Is there further guidance or is that simply that we need to reassess this and update this ordinance?,136,,
567,0.97,4317.813,4326.221,Our recommendation leaves that operational ordinate again as a nation up to the experts at S.D.O.T ..,137,,
568,0.97,4326.221,4347.71,From our work on this issue we found that using something broad like the age of the bridge or what kind of entity owns it is not specific enough to address safety risk.,137,,
569,0.97,4347.71,4350.579,You could Avenue bridge that is unsafe and an old bridge that is safe.,137,,
570,0.97,4350.579,4357.453,So we are asking them to use her expertise to develop something that fits with the variety of bridges that we have in that area.,137,,
571,0.97,4357.453,4358.053,Okay.,138,,
572,0.97,4358.053,4358.821,Thank you.,138,,
573,0.97,4358.821,4366.362,Okay.,139,,
574,0.97,4366.362,4366.562,Yes.,139,,
575,0.97,4366.562,4366.962,Slide 15.,139,,
576,0.97,4366.962,4372.267,"Finally, I want to return to the overall message of our audit.",140,,
577,0.97,4372.267,4379.742,"Bridge conditions might look like other places in the country, that is not a good place for us as far as that is concerned.",140,,
578,0.97,4379.742,4382.277,The city needs to invest more in bridge maintenance and S.D.O.T.,141,,
579,0.97,4382.277,4391.954,Has spent the money allocated for that purpose and adding more money is not the only thing that needs to be done.,141,,
580,0.97,4391.954,4409.571,"As I described, updating the useful life of the bridges need to happen and other areas should be addressed including addressing the informal review findings, reducing the amount of Reimbursable work the maintenance crews do and updating the oversight of private bridges.",141,,
581,0.97,4409.571,4419.748,Okay.,142,,
582,0.97,4420.282,4422.484,In conclusion I want to emphasize our gratitude to S.D.O.T.,142,,
583,0.97,4422.484,4426.989,For their cooperation and to note that they are taking steps now to implement many of our recommendation.,142,,
584,0.97,4426.989,4430.726,Excuse me.,143,,
585,0.97,4430.726,4437.366,"If I may add for the public, Councilmembers are aware of this.",143,,
586,0.97,4437.366,4448.444,Any recommendation in our report should be followed up on it until it has been implemented or closed so just a note on that.,143,,
587,0.97,4448.444,4457.553,"The recommendations we have made, we don't just walk them and walk away.",143,,
588,0.97,4457.553,4458.854,We will touch base with S.D.O.T.,143,,
589,0.97,4458.854,4460.923,To see what progress they have made on these recommendations.,143,,
590,0.97,4460.923,4461.623,Thank you.,144,,
591,0.97,4461.623,4462.958,We will hear from S.D.O.T.,144,,
592,0.97,4462.958,4472.367,Briefly and then the city officer.,144,,
593,0.97,4472.367,4473.068,"Councilman Herbold, please.",144,,
594,0.97,4473.068,4475.671,I want to put on the table one question for S.D.O.T.,145,,
595,0.97,4475.671,4482.878,And then a question for the auditor.,145,,
596,0.97,4482.878,4485.547,The question for S.D.O.T.,145,,
597,0.97,4485.547,4494.089,Is--it relates to the bridge load level reading.,145,,
598,0.97,4494.089,4499.595,I was under the impression that because of load level rating regulations from the Federal Government that S.D.O.T.,145,,
599,0.97,4499.595,4513.075,Needed to Re-Rate the load levels for the bridges and that was going to be part of this audit.,145,,
600,0.97,4513.075,4525.02,I understand that it is possible that it could not be part of the audit if that was work that S.D.O.T.,145,,
601,0.97,4525.02,4525.42,Needed to do.,145,,
602,0.97,4525.42,4555.384,Then my other question relates more to the fact that this focus on maintenance around bridges RAISES a broader question for asset maintenance of other S.D.O.T.,145,,
603,0.97,4557.119,4560.956,Capital structures which I understand there has not been an asset management study since 2015.,145,,
604,0.97,4560.956,4576.772,"You can see that from taking a look at that an asset management study and taking a look at the value of infrastructure, it does you can see the information contained is dated.",145,,
605,0.97,4576.772,4596.291,So given that we have taken this deep dive on bridges and learned what we have learned on bridges does it make sense to do it with things like arterial pavement and other hard assets that S.D.O.T.,145,,
606,0.97,4596.291,4598.293,Is responsible for doing maintenance on?,145,,
607,0.97,4598.293,4606.468,We can hear--Laura lie can probably address that.,146,,
608,0.97,4606.468,4619.514,I know one point is that when we decided to do the bridge audit was to remind us of all the other assets they have to manage.,146,,
609,0.97,4619.514,4621.483,I think they have a shared interest in this.,146,,
610,0.97,4621.483,4626.955,If we can turn it over to S.D.O.T.,146,,
611,0.97,4626.955,4629.024,For brief remarks and see if the auditor has anything dad.,146,,
612,0.97,4629.024,4632.427,Thank you.,147,,
613,0.97,4632.427,4649.511,"So I wanted to share a few thoughts in summary and then I will roll into answering the questions I heard during the course of the presentation so good morning, everyone.",147,,
614,0.97,4649.511,4654.416,Thank you for having S.D.O.T.,147,,
615,0.97,4654.416,4655.417,At the table today.,147,,
616,0.97,4655.417,4657.252,I am the deputy director for capital project delivery.,147,,
617,0.97,4657.252,4677.973,We want to thank Councilmember Pederson for initiating this audit and thank the office of the city auditor for their excellent work and the professional way that they handled putting this report together.,147,,
618,0.97,4677.973,4680.575,I would be Remiss if I did not mention and thank our S.D.O.T.,147,,
619,0.97,4680.575,4694.99,Team led by matt Donahue and our Finance team for putting in the time and work to work with the city auditor's office.,147,,
620,0.97,4694.99,4696.858,There was a lot of information together and put forward.,147,,
621,0.97,4696.858,4701.296,It was a collaborative experience for all of us.,147,,
622,0.97,4701.296,4701.897,From S.D.O.T.,147,,
623,0.97,4701.897,4709.471,To the city to the city of Seattle we could benefit from the process and the report itself.,147,,
624,0.97,4709.471,4727.722,It cause attention to our maintenance challenges and we are looking forward to where we go from here.,147,,
625,0.97,4727.722,4729.524,A quick few points that I want to make.,147,,
626,0.97,4729.524,4731.226,First public safety is our number one priority.,147,,
627,0.97,4731.226,4735.997,We are committed to developing a comprehensive and protective bridge program in alignment with what the auditor's office has presented.,147,,
628,0.97,4735.997,4744.606,"As you know and has been said, we have begun that effort.",147,,
629,0.97,4744.606,4747.042,"When it comes to maintaining public safety, we always strive to improve.",147,,
630,0.97,4747.042,4757.552,"The second, this is important, the closure of the high will rise bridge this year is what Instigated this audit, it is actually not the result.",148,,
631,0.97,4757.552,4765.327,The closure is not the fault of any deficiency in the bridge maintenance program.,148,,
632,0.97,4765.327,4785.247,These were identified and addressed as a result of our thorough bridge inspection program which had us inspected that at twice the rate of Federal guidelines.,148,,
633,0.97,4785.247,4800.595,Next the most critical challenge we feel we face as we work toward this is Scaling up funding.,148,,
634,0.97,4800.595,4810.005,The audit includes some helpful process improvements that we will definitely implement to be able to game a better understanding of where we need to go from here but the greatest challenge we have faced and will continue to face is sustainable Scalable sources of revenue.,148,,
635,0.97,4810.005,4812.207,That will develop a more comprehensive asset management program.,148,,
636,0.97,4812.207,4818.713,That is a nod to other assets that S.D.O.T.,148,,
637,0.97,4818.713,4829.424,And roadway structures has to maintain.,148,,
638,0.97,4829.424,4840.702,Consistent the audit does have funding for bridge maintenance.,148,,
639,0.97,4840.702,4845.907,"As was noted in the presentation with $123 billion backlog nationwide, Seattle is not alone in this trend.",148,,
640,0.97,4845.907,4853.849,We are aligned with every other major city in America.,148,,
641,0.97,4853.849,4874.97,While that is a city state and Federal Government wide change we have important work to do in order to better understand what a fully Resourced breach maintenance plan looks like in terms of total dollars and scope.,148,,
642,0.97,4874.97,4875.971,Staffing resources as well.,148,,
643,0.97,4875.971,4879.04,We need to figure out what it would take for us to build up to capacity.,148,,
644,0.97,4879.04,4894.289,You have probably heard the directors say that if we had the money today takes us time to ramp up staffing resources to be able to return to it so money is not the only piece of the puzzle.,148,,
645,0.97,4894.289,4896.491,The Workplan we are planning to develop will reflect that.,148,,
646,0.97,4896.491,4906.868,"As was noted, we partially Concerne with recommendation number two digit for Reimbursable work.",148,,
647,0.97,4906.868,4925.42,"With safety as our Northstar for all that we do, we are grateful for this report and the suggestions around keeping the traveling public safe and managing the money responsibly but we disagree that there work in itself is a problem.",148,,
648,0.97,4925.42,4946.508,"The challenges that we are able to maintain more staff with that Reimbursable work then we would be able to with the existing maintenance budget so gives us flexibility and more ability to respond to emergencies, training, development and that kind of thing.",148,,
649,0.97,4946.508,4957.052,"So the reallocation of resources to Reimbursable is definitely a challenge, for now with funding levels that allows us to keep more staff on board.",148,,
650,0.97,4957.052,4975.77,So that brings us all to our goal to fully fund inspection and maintenance staffing needs in the way we could outline better with this work plan and how we can deliver on our program.,148,,
651,0.97,4975.77,4977.639,I can stop there for a moment for questions.,148,,
652,0.97,4977.639,4978.94,"Yes, please.",149,,
653,0.97,4978.94,4985.68,Vice chair Strauss?,149,,
654,0.97,4985.68,4986.481,Thank you.,150,,
655,0.97,4986.481,4987.482,It's good to see you.,150,,
656,0.97,4987.482,4988.85,Thank you for all your great work.,150,,
657,0.97,4988.85,5004.599,My question yesterday to the auditor's team was actually a recommendation to Reimbursable work because we know that having a work crew with a high level of expertise for any Department is important.,150,,
658,0.97,5004.599,5034.429,"My question there was, you partially answered this, is it an issue that we just need a larger crew or should we start having these other departments create their own inspection crews.",150,,
659,0.97,5034.429,5035.43,I don't have a preference.,150,,
660,0.97,5035.43,5040.402,It just seems to me that it seems like we have a higher level staff and then a Follow- up question to that is regarding budgeting.,150,,
661,0.97,5040.402,5045.407,Is it--do we currently have a single line item for bridge maintenance and operations and repair orders as scattered throughout the budget?,150,,
662,0.97,5045.407,5046.274,Thank you.,151,,
663,0.97,5046.274,5057.619,Let me answer the second question first.,152,,
664,0.97,5057.619,5059.02,It is in a variety of places.,152,,
665,0.97,5059.02,5060.655,"Summer levy find it, some are not.",152,,
666,0.97,5060.655,5065.326,The auditor team had to go in and work with our Finance team and make sure they understood what pieces they were looking at.,152,,
667,0.97,5065.326,5081.209,The--you have to look at the full details of our maintenance Úand Rehab and replacement budget to understand the reasons sources we have to maintain our assets and Sean and Jamie may have something more to say.,152,,
668,0.97,5081.209,5102.63,"And Councilmember Strauss, your first question around Reimbursables, what would actually be ideal would be to increase our funding and staffing resources in the long run, which is what we need to be able to plan out and better explain and present in the future.",152,,
669,0.97,5102.63,5130.725,"I would recommend that even as we make those changes, we would still Ideally have enough staff that we could handle Reimbursable work so we could have the flexibility that comes with that and by having that Reimbursable work part of what we do, then we can have a larger staff than we might otherwise have depending on just the bridge maintenance budget.",152,,
670,0.97,5130.725,5134.996,Thank you.,153,,
671,0.97,5134.996,5138.066,We have Calvin from the central staff here.,154,,
672,0.97,5138.066,5151.446,"I know when the Mayor's budget is transmitted, he and we all will be looking carefully at the bridge maintenance line items to see, was there an Icrease or are we maintaining that level?",154,,
673,0.97,5151.446,5167.262,Thank you . I think I wanted to just underscore something in this presentation that the bridges are very old and the medium age is 70.,155,,
674,0.97,5167.262,5175.837,"When we talk about maintenance, it becomes replacement . a much larger project.",155,,
675,0.97,5175.837,5184.779,That happened at Fairview and has been the conversation around magnolia and other Bidges.,155,,
676,0.97,5184.779,5187.515,There was a new Seattle levy that expires at the end of 2024.,155,,
677,0.97,5187.515,5192.487,It had three categories for this.,155,,
678,0.97,5192.487,5195.089,There was $420 million for maintenance and repair.,155,,
679,0.97,5195.089,5200.895,It moved slightly with the future Council action.,155,,
680,0.97,5200.895,5228.022,"As a whole, there is a series of commitments that have been made the next real opportunity to consider what we do on a amounts of money will be when new Seattle comes up for renewal .: conversation will give officials information in 2023.",155,,
681,0.97,5228.022,5238.6,So what do we do to have that better information and look at our assets and put something before voters to address some of these needs.,155,,
682,0.97,5238.6,5244.238,There are near-term issues that would be appropriate for our budget cycle and how we deal with the regular maintenance.,155,,
683,0.97,5244.238,5252.814,"But, this is big dollar items as well so we need to think about it in two different scales.",155,,
684,0.97,5252.814,5253.815,Thank you.,156,,
685,0.97,5253.815,5258.453,Can we hear a final word?,157,,
686,0.97,5258.453,5263.758,"Laura lie, are you finished from S.D.O.T.",157,,
687,0.97,5263.758,5269.163,? there were a few other questions that were asked but if you want to rush I can cab grab them.,157,,
688,0.97,5269.163,5272.934,Calvin got the Seattle one.,157,,
689,0.97,5272.934,5283.678,Just a note in terms of the private infrastructure we inspect.,157,,
690,0.97,5283.678,5289.55,One thing we have noted is we could hire outside resources to do them other than drawing for Martin.,157,,
691,0.97,5289.55,5303.431,"Also, make sure that you all were aware that we last year created roadway structures as its own division so we could understand the growing maintenance needs.",157,,
692,0.97,5303.431,5318.212,Then there was a question about the bridge load rating program and what that looks like going forward with the changes from the Federal Government.,157,,
693,0.97,5318.212,5320.882,I was going to call on matt Donahue Quigley to respond to that.,157,,
694,0.97,5320.882,5321.482,Thank you.,158,,
695,0.97,5321.482,5321.883,Good morning.,158,,
696,0.97,5321.883,5324.218,My name is matt Donahue.,158,,
697,0.97,5324.218,5335.83,I think what was being referred to is the mandate from the highway administration.,158,,
698,0.97,5335.83,5349.944,That dictated that all owners of certain types of bridges on the national highway system have to load their bridges for two new kinds of vehicles.,158,,
699,0.97,5349.944,5353.347,They are special hall vehicles an emergency vehicles.,158,,
700,0.97,5353.347,5365.026,"So, that resulted in us starting a program due in 2022 that we load rate 69 bridges for those specific trucks.",158,,
701,0.97,5365.026,5375.436,"Councilmember Pederson, I think that is everything I had notes about.",159,,
702,0.97,5375.436,5375.87,Thank you.,160,,
703,0.97,5375.87,5383.845,Councilmember Herbold.,161,,
704,0.97,5383.845,5394.789,"For the bridges that you have done these new load level ratings for, I understand they are not all due until 2022.",162,,
705,0.97,5394.789,5478.239,"But, my recollection is that the regulatory change was back in 2014 or 2015 and the cities were given a long time to complete all the load level ratings of all of the eligible bridges,--there is an expectation that we don't just wait until 2022 and do them all and that we phase the work in and I guess my question is, for those bridges that the work has already been completed, has the city auditor looked at those new load level readings as part of the city audit on bridges and come to any conclusions about something that we should be doing differently with those bridges that have--already had this work done, these new ratings? as we know, this is what triggered in some ways greater scrutiny on the West Seattle bridge.",162,,
706,0.97,5478.239,5495.69,"I'm just wondering, if we went through that same exercise with other bridges for which we have done the new load level ratings on, would we come to conclusions about bridges that are rated fare that need some extra attention?",162,,
707,0.97,5495.69,5498.392,A couple of things.,163,,
708,0.97,5498.392,5507.702,"In the audit, load rating was considered in respect to the budget.",163,,
709,0.97,5507.702,5515.643,If you look up bridge maintenance it is comprised of four components.,163,,
710,0.97,5515.643,5522.316,Two out of the general fund into out of capital.,163,,
711,0.97,5522.316,5538.799,"I think when I hear what you're saying, load rating takes a look at bridge components for truck type.",163,,
712,0.97,5538.799,5540.835,It says will the bridge handle the load from that vehicle.,163,,
713,0.97,5540.835,5567.495,It is not an assessment of the bridge.,163,,
714,0.97,5567.495,5572.934,The audit recommendation about getting down to the bridge preservation program component by component rather than just using an efficiency rating which is what we do now.,163,,
715,0.97,5572.934,5574.969,It that speaks more to what you are asking for.,163,,
716,0.97,5574.969,5579.64,"If the overall rating is fair, we can identify specific components that need to be addressed even though overall the bridges considered fair.",163,,
717,0.97,5579.64,5580.441,That is helpful.,164,,
718,0.97,5580.441,5583.377,I have more refinement of my not very well stated questions as a follow-up.,164,,
719,0.97,5583.377,5583.878,Thank you.,165,,
720,0.97,5583.878,5585.446,Thank you.,166,,
721,0.97,5585.446,5589.984,"Matt, if you could stay on the line.",167,,
722,0.97,5589.984,5596.524,Your last comment was something that was brought up by Eugene Wasserman today regarding a bridge.,167,,
723,0.97,5596.524,5611.105,As I was traveling to city hall today it was just after 9 am and I noticed the bridge was up which is outside of our typical--usually the bridge does not open like that.,167,,
724,0.97,5611.105,5612.306,I guess it is after nine.,167,,
725,0.97,5612.306,5613.507,"Nevermind, let me retract that.",167,,
726,0.97,5613.507,5632.159,I was worried the bridge was stuck up and I took the Fremont component level issued . F that I appreciate you calling that out and ask us to look at this component by component.,167,,
727,0.97,5632.159,5635.029,I also wanted to follow up with you regarding the private bridge inspection.,167,,
728,0.97,5635.029,5644.538,It's my understanding that we as the city charge the owners of these private bridges for the inspections.,167,,
729,0.97,5644.538,5651.746,Is that correct?,167,,
730,0.97,5651.746,5652.346,That is correct.,168,,
731,0.97,5652.346,5656.283,I think the second paragraph of that ordinance on the screen talks about how we charge them for that.,168,,
732,0.97,5656.283,5663.524,That is why it could be easy to get consultants to fill that void.,168,,
733,0.97,5663.524,5671.499,"And one more thing because it came up, we are working on the transportation asset management plan and the update for that.",168,,
734,0.97,5671.499,5672.867,Okay.,169,,
735,0.97,5672.867,5698.259,"To your point from earlier, with the Reimbursable work and the work that can be either--with private bridges where the funding is not an issue it is that we as a city need to take a stronger look at the work crews we are able to provide.",169,,
736,0.97,5698.259,5700.094,I'm just putting that in there for the record.,169,,
737,0.97,5700.094,5700.494,Thank you.,169,,
738,0.97,5700.494,5701.095,Thank you.,170,,
739,0.97,5701.095,5710.204,And thank you people from the city auditor and S.D.O.T ..,170,,
740,0.97,5710.204,5718.379,We are going to give the city auditor--they mentioned they will be back in follow-up on these recommendation.,170,,
741,0.97,5718.379,5734.428,"If you have additional questions for them that you want to address, we will have them back at our committee and they were actually able to do so much more work in this period of time than we expected.",170,,
742,0.97,5734.428,5751.512,We were hoping to get this preliminary report to the Mayor transmitting her budget so we could--it might be helpful to the executive branch and inform us as we decide how to amend the budget.,170,,
743,0.97,5751.512,5758.252,They got a lot more work done in advance and thanks a lot to S.D.O.T ..,170,,
744,0.97,5758.252,5759.62,We will still hear from them again.,170,,
745,0.97,5759.62,5765.459,So any questions that you have of them? any final words before we move on?,170,,
746,0.97,5765.459,5769.363,I will defer to the team.,171,,
747,0.97,5769.363,5772.199,I don't know if Sean or Jane had anything they wanted to add?,171,,
748,0.97,5772.199,5779.24,This is a very expensive and complicated problem and the consequences of doing nothing are severe.,172,,
749,0.97,5779.24,5785.98,I think the good news story is that you have S.D.O.T.,172,,
750,0.97,5785.98,5791.685,Interested in doing this work.,172,,
751,0.97,5791.685,5793.687,We are hoping this will put us in a better place.,172,,
752,0.97,5793.687,5797.992,Thank you.,173,,
753,0.97,5797.992,5805.533,"Once again, it is a collaboration between the executive branch and legislative branches greatly appreciated.",173,,
754,0.97,5805.533,5806.1,Okay.,174,,
755,0.97,5806.1,5812.406,This move to item number 3.,174,,
756,0.97,5812.406,5813.407,There is a Council bill.,174,,
757,0.97,5813.407,5819.013,Will the clerk read item 3 into the record?,174,,
758,0.97,5819.013,5870.064,"While people are getting themselves ready, council bill 119870 and ordinance relating to the city light Department authorizing the general manager and Ceo to execute a 10 year agreement with Pend Oreille County for loss of revenues and additional financial burdens for the city light Department's operation of the boundary hydroelectric project on the Pend Oreille River pursuant to Rcw 35 21 for 20 3521 for 25, 3521 426, and 3541 427.",175,,
759,0.97,5870.064,5870.531,Thank you.,176,,
760,0.97,5870.531,5873.5,We do have with us this Ceo and general manager of Seattle city light.,176,,
761,0.97,5873.5,5878.973,We also have our central staff.,176,,
762,0.97,5878.973,5891.585,"Eric, did you want to say anything to introduce this or handed over to Deborah Smith.",176,,
763,0.97,5892.92,5893.887,We can jump right in.,177,,
764,0.97,5893.887,5896.49,I'm here if you have any questions you would like to ask.,177,,
765,0.97,5896.49,5897.091,Thank you.,178,,
766,0.97,5897.091,5897.391,Okay.,179,,
767,0.97,5897.391,5907.668,So we need to come up with an abbreviated title for you.,179,,
768,0.97,5907.668,5909.503,We can just go with the general manager.,180,,
769,0.97,5909.503,5910.304,That works for me.,180,,
770,0.97,5910.304,5912.373,Thank you for the opportunity to be here.,181,,
771,0.97,5912.373,5914.341,It feels really good to be back.,181,,
772,0.97,5914.341,5919.213,Even though it is a slightly different way.,181,,
773,0.97,5919.213,5921.315,It feels good to be picking up pork and moving forward.,181,,
774,0.97,5921.315,5931.825,We will bring items to you today that I think--next week as well.,181,,
775,0.97,5931.825,5934.295,It's great that he be here and great to see you.,181,,
776,0.97,5934.295,5935.296,Let me introduce the team.,182,,
777,0.97,5935.296,5938.999,We have items and they will be introduced.,182,,
778,0.97,5938.999,5945.873,I am the first two items that will be reviewing.,182,,
779,0.97,5945.873,5964.358,We also have Mike Haynes are chief operating officer and then we will switch directions and we will talk about green up and the metering.,182,,
780,0.97,5964.358,5993.287,"Again, these are all fairly--maybe not routine, but they are tactical kinds of issues when we come before you next we will talk about far-reaching transportation plans and that is a more Forward-Looking piece of Úwork.",182,,
781,0.97,5993.287,5993.988,These are important pieces.,182,,
782,0.97,5993.988,5996.056,With that I will turn it over to Mike Haynes.,182,,
783,0.97,5996.056,5996.657,Thank you.,183,,
784,0.97,5996.657,5998.492,Good morning to the committee and Council chair.,183,,
785,0.97,5998.492,6006.7,I am the cheap chief operating officer.,183,,
786,0.97,6006.7,6021.615,This constitutes a renewal of an existing 10 year agreement that expired at the end of 2019.,183,,
787,0.97,6021.615,6025.119,"As long as I have been here, we have been negotiating these on about a 10 year cycle.",183,,
788,0.97,6025.119,6026.92,We have a similar agreement with other counties.,183,,
789,0.97,6026.92,6035.229,That will come due in a couple of years time.,183,,
790,0.97,6035.229,6037.197,Context is what it is in this first slide.,183,,
791,0.97,6037.197,6051.011,A gives you the authority from the state to require us to pay impact fees to counties outside our jurisdiction where we operate our hydroelectric plant.,183,,
792,0.97,6051.011,6075.669,"Within the context of this particular agreement that we have negotiated with the county the city is obligated to, because of our publication and because we built a hydroelectric plant . This written agreement requires continued payments by state law even though the current contract is expired.",184,,
793,0.97,6075.669,6082.176,We continue to pay based on the expired agreement from last year.,184,,
794,0.97,6082.176,6086.98,That was built into the Rcw.,184,,
795,0.97,6086.98,6095.689,The next--the reason why we do this and the reason it is in the Rcw is in front of you.,184,,
796,0.97,6095.689,6103.73,"These elements affect the safety, welfare and public health.",184,,
797,0.97,6103.73,6114.108,They are impacts highlighted in the context of constructing a major Hydro project on a river system.,184,,
798,0.97,6114.108,6118.312,One thing I wanted to highlight is road maintenance.,184,,
799,0.97,6118.312,6120.047,We do take that part very seriously.,184,,
800,0.97,6120.047,6131.725,That was a major component contributing to the current renewal and negotiations that took place late last year and earlier this year.,184,,
801,0.97,6131.725,6134.995,So this is the basis for the dollars.,184,,
802,0.97,6134.995,6149.977,"Going forward, the county will take those dollars and distribute them according to the construct in the agreement.",184,,
803,0.97,6155.015,6157.317,"Little bit more context, arbitration is a clause within the Rcw.",185,,
804,0.97,6157.317,6159.853,We did not have to go that route because negotiations were successful.,185,,
805,0.97,6159.853,6168.262,"The County, myself and Debra came to an agreement and everyone is in agreement with the terms we came up with.",185,,
806,0.97,6168.262,6171.064,"As I mentioned earlier, this replaces an agreement that expired last year.",185,,
807,0.97,6171.064,6177.938,We anticipated being back here in about nine years time to present the next 10 year agreement.,185,,
808,0.97,6177.938,6178.272,Next slide.,185,,
809,0.97,6178.272,6184.545,This slide the highlights the order and magnitude of the dollars that are in play for the county.,186,,
810,0.97,6184.545,6196.49,The county gets these disbursements in quarterly payments and then the county Disperses payments according to provisions in the agreement.,186,,
811,0.97,6196.49,6207.701,The agreement identifies the county is the keeper of the funds and disbursement of the authority.,187,,
812,0.97,6207.701,6209.503,There are three towns in the context.,187,,
813,0.97,6209.503,6215.008,Close proximity to our boundary project.,187,,
814,0.97,6215.008,6234.494,Day get a portion of these funds by formulas distributed to them for the general funds and associated with that our three school districts that get appropriations based on County formula . The three school districts are listed here.,187,,
815,0.97,6234.494,6251.511,"As a point of information the Selkirk school district, if we have School-Aged kids or children of city employees that work at boundary they are more than likely attending that school district.",187,,
816,0.97,6251.511,6259.853,"And then, that last bullet confirms the county does fund disbursements.",187,,
817,0.97,6259.853,6263.156,So that was pretty quick.,187,,
818,0.97,6263.156,6266.927,I am happy to take any questions.,187,,
819,0.97,6266.927,6272.633,Any questions on this Council bill?,188,,
820,0.97,6272.633,6275.469,Okay.,189,,
821,0.97,6275.469,6282.876,We will go ahead.,190,,
822,0.97,6282.876,6286.079,I don't see any questions from colleagues so dashed,190,,
823,0.97,6286.079,6287.014,Go ahead.,191,,
824,0.97,6287.014,6298.492,"I just wanted to say that the meeting with Seattle city Bank, your team is excellent.",192,,
825,0.97,6298.492,6300.227,They were able to answer all my questions.,192,,
826,0.97,6300.227,6309.269,This is very routine and a standard piece of legislation so thank you to everyone for making this happen.,192,,
827,0.97,6309.269,6311.004,Thank you.,193,,
828,0.97,6311.004,6313.507,Thank you.,194,,

830,0.97,6325.852,6326.52,Is there a second?,195,,
831,0.97,6326.52,6326.987,Second.,196,,
832,0.97,6326.987,6329.589,It has been moved and Seconded to recommend passage of the bill.,197,,

842,0.97,6350.11,6350.51,Yes.,204,,
843,0.97,6350.51,6352.913,Five yes,205,,
844,0.97,6352.913,6361.455,Zero no.,206,,
845,0.97,6361.455,6365.926,This will be sent to the September 21 city Councilmember meeting.,206,,
846,0.97,6365.926,6372.866,Now item number 4. please read the item for the agenda.,206,,
847,0.97,6372.866,6409.603,Council bill 119857 . and ordinance relating to the city light Department clarifying that residents living in the city light Department owned housing in the Diablo community are subject to the city light Department's rates under Chapter 2149 and 2156 of the Seattle municipal code amending section 2156 030 of this code and Verifying and confirming certain prior acts.,207,,
848,0.97,6409.603,6410.47,Thank you.,208,,
849,0.97,6410.47,6413.473,Thank you.,209,,
850,0.97,6413.473,6420.147,Not going to do additional introductions.,210,,
851,0.97,6420.147,6429.322,This is a fairly housekeeping type of item so I will turn it back over to Mike Haynes again.,210,,
852,0.97,6429.322,6430.524,Thank you very much.,211,,
853,0.97,6430.524,6431.324,Thank you Council chair.,211,,
854,0.97,6431.324,6445.739,The next slide please? the history of this goes way back in time before my time . We own 44 houses in the Diablo in the North cascades.,211,,
855,0.97,6445.739,6468.328,We have a few employees that receive utilities as part of a collective bargaining agreement or through offers because of their essential capacity with the city and their desire to live in our company town.,211,,
856,0.97,6468.328,6475.035,Other employees who work and live in the area sign rental agreements requiring them to pay rent and utilities.,211,,
857,0.97,6475.035,6495.488,So the language we are updating at the recommendation of the law Department is in front of you now this is not been changed in a very long time I believe the language dates back into the 70s.,212,,
858,0.97,6495.488,6507.701,This is an opportunity to clear up some ambiguities and clear up any confusion for new Renters and existing Renters under current lease agreements.,212,,
859,0.97,6507.701,6524.784,Then we look at the proposed amended language and the revised language for the SMC which makes it explicit that employees living in company housing will pay utilities.,212,,
860,0.97,6524.784,6526.219,That is the gist of this update.,212,,
861,0.97,6526.219,6527.12,"Next slide, please.",212,,
862,0.97,6527.12,6537.13,"So, this is summarizing what the code application does.",213,,
863,0.97,6537.13,6559.319,It requires people living in the towns and working for the city to pay electric rates similar to All-City residences and I mentioned earlier that some rental agreement 6+ lovely require this.,213,,
864,0.97,6559.319,6571.064,"There has been some confusion or misinterpretation of this over the years that we have had to clear up on a case-by-case basis and again, the Department has been recommending this for sometime and I'm glad we are finally bringing it to the table today.",213,,
865,0.97,6571.064,6580.24,The impact is that it clarifies that employees will be paying utilities with the rental contract.,214,,
866,0.97,6580.24,6589.182,This is not impact existing arrangements by labor agreement or hiring letters . Those agreements stand.,214,,
867,0.97,6589.182,6613.106,This language is clearing up what has been the practice for very long time and then also makes it very clean for new Renters coming in and new employees who want to rent housing with the terms and conditions that are embedded into the rental agreement.,214,,
868,0.97,6613.106,6613.907,That was very fast.,214,,
869,0.97,6613.907,6617.01,I'm happy to take questions.,214,,
870,0.97,6617.01,6617.811,Thank you.,215,,
871,0.97,6617.811,6622.983,Any questions on this bill or the presentation?,215,,
872,0.97,6622.983,6627.52,Council member Strauss.,216,,
873,0.97,6627.52,6648.241,This is just an update to clarify and make consistent what could be confusing language and it is well received.,217,,
874,0.97,6648.241,6649.809,Thank you for making this available.,217,,
875,0.97,6649.809,6650.176,Thank you.,218,,
876,0.97,6650.176,6653.947,With no further questions I would like to move that the committee recommend Passageof Council bill 119857.,219,,
877,0.97,6653.947,6655.348,Is there a second?,219,,
878,0.97,6655.348,6659.853,Second.,220,,
879,0.97,6659.853,6660.854,Okay moved and Seconded.,221,,
880,0.97,6660.854,6662.389,Any final comments or questions?,221,,
881,0.97,6662.389,6664.524,Great.,222,,
882,0.97,6664.524,6673.7,So we will have the clerk read the role and the recommendation that this bill passed.,223,,
883,0.97,6673.7,6673.967,Gonzalez?,223,,
884,0.97,6673.967,6674.467,All right.,224,,

890,0.97,6686.88,6687.647,Yes.,230,,

892,0.97,6689.482,6700.727,The committee recommendation that this pass will be sent to the city council meeting on September 21.,232,,
893,0.97,6700.727,6707.0,Now the item number 5. that's 119871.,232,,
894,0.97,6707.0,6709.636,Please read item 5 and of record.,232,,
895,0.97,6709.636,6734.928,Council bill 119871. and ordinance relating to the city light Department establishing updated eligibility requirements for net metering and customer requested net metering aggregation billing arrangements and amending section 2129 082 of the Seattle municipal code.,233,,
896,0.97,6734.928,6738.631,Thank you.,234,,
897,0.97,6738.631,6745.138,We have another short presentation by city light.,234,,
898,0.97,6745.138,6746.272,"General manager Smith, take it away.",234,,
899,0.97,6746.272,6747.006,Thank you.,235,,
900,0.97,6747.006,6757.35,The next two items are both provisions and offerings from the solutions group.,235,,
901,0.97,6757.35,6767.227,Up first is the Netmeeting ordering a technical fix and I will turn it over to LORI for presentation.,235,,
902,0.97,6767.227,6767.627,"Thank you, Lord.",235,,
903,0.97,6767.627,6768.528,Thank you.,236,,
904,0.97,6768.528,6778.972,Good morning and thank you for having us this morning.,236,,
905,0.97,6778.972,6788.448,So we have been involved in renewable energy for a long time and we have a whole suite of renewable energy programs.,236,,
906,0.97,6788.448,6795.488,This request today is to align our current ordinance to with the city ordinance.,236,,
907,0.97,6795.488,6807.901,That gives me an opportunity to tell you of this.,236,,
908,0.97,6807.901,6812.205,In the 1990s net metering was adopted.,236,,
909,0.97,6812.205,6819.179,Over the years the requirements for net metering have change.,236,,
910,0.97,6819.179,6828.421,Initially utilities were asked to have a cap of .1% of their 1996 demand.,236,,
911,0.97,6828.421,6838.431,For city light that meant 10 Megawatts and we hit 10 Megawatts and kept going.,236,,
912,0.97,6838.431,6840.233,They only required us to meet their cap.,236,,
913,0.97,6840.233,6852.845,As a municipal utility we allowed additional customers to continue to get net metering under our own umbrella.,236,,
914,0.97,6852.845,6859.552,"Today, the cap for net metering is 4% of the 1990 6p demand.",236,,
915,0.97,6859.552,6861.554,For city light that represents 78 Megawatts of solar.,236,,
916,0.97,6861.554,6862.989,Our current total is 41% of that.,236,,
917,0.97,6862.989,6891.651,We have currently 32 Megawatts of solar connected . that is 26 in the home sector and six in the business sector.,236,,
918,0.97,6891.651,6894.887,So we do support solar and other renewable energy products across all of our portfolio.,236,,
919,0.97,6894.887,6900.059,In addition to net metering we have recently added the option to aggregate and I will talk a little bit about that in the next slide.,236,,
920,0.97,6900.059,6908.268,In addition to an aggregation option we are looking to pilot a virtual net metering option in affordable housing.,236,,
921,0.97,6908.268,6920.179,What that allows us for one system to create it multiple customer bills which would be the great case to enable solar on a multi family building.,236,,
922,0.97,6920.179,6934.227,We last year adopted a large solar program which created a clear progress and purchase for customers who wanted to exceed up to two Megawatts.,236,,
923,0.97,6934.227,6949.509,We also work with the Department of construction and inspections very closely on this energy code.,236,,
924,0.97,6949.509,6953.146,The code has a current solar ready requirement for multi family buildings over three stories and commercial.,236,,
925,0.97,6953.146,6957.05,The new code will go into effect and is currently going to go into effect in February.,236,,
926,0.97,6957.05,6960.653,It is under review currently.,236,,
927,0.97,6960.653,6981.975,It requires solar installed at the time of construction.,236,,
928,0.97,6981.975,6988.548,For residential there is no firm requirement right now for solar Boatbuilders have to choose certain Energy-Efficient options and solar is one of those options they can choose from to meet code requirements.,236,,
929,0.97,6988.548,6991.951,I will talk about our voluntary programs with the second item I will present on.,237,,
930,0.97,6991.951,6999.759,That again is a 20 year effort by Seattle city light to promote renewable energy in our community.,237,,
931,0.97,6999.759,7027.186,"The Greenup program is supporting actual project development in local schools, community centers, Nonprofits and focuses on affordable housing.",238,,
932,0.97,7027.186,7035.828,So across the programs we have supported net metering and solar for quite some time.,238,,
933,0.97,7035.828,7048.641,So the purpose of this request is basically to align the Seattle code with the steak code.,239,,
934,0.97,7048.641,7049.642,There are two simple changes.,239,,
935,0.97,7049.642,7061.454,The first changes relative to how we account for solar energy in Netmeeting customers generate power with their solar cells and if they consume it internal to the House they get retail rate.,239,,
936,0.97,7061.454,7063.356,If they generate more than the home consumes: it's exported.,239,,
937,0.97,7063.356,7067.927,It is put in a bank.,239,,
938,0.97,7067.927,7078.971,They Bank all summer long and then in the winter they will pull from the Bank and then the bank is cleared out at a point in time.,239,,
939,0.97,7078.971,7080.139,Previously that had been April 30.,239,,
940,0.97,7080.139,7113.105,The Rcw has change that to March 31 which gives customers another month to acquire solar assuming we will get some solar generation in April that they can pull from in the winter.,239,,
941,0.97,7113.105,7114.474,"So a great benefit, small change.",239,,
942,0.97,7114.474,7117.944,The second piece the Rcw allows for is utilities can recover administrative cost of allowing net meter aggregation.,239,,
943,0.97,7117.944,7121.481,Aggregation is when you have a customer who owns more than one solar array on adjacent properties.,239,,
944,0.97,7121.481,7130.089,So if you have a large garage on a parcel and your home Next- door on a parcel and there are two meters and two solar rays you can now combine those two are your home can benefit from the generation on the garage.,239,,
945,0.97,7130.089,7136.596,That is required is to make some changes in the billing system so utilities can now recover those costs.,239,,
946,0.97,7136.596,7140.233,What we would like to do is provide a one-time settlement fee to do that aggregation in our system.,239,,
947,0.97,7140.233,7147.34,We have a question from Councilmember Strauss.,240,,
948,0.97,7147.34,7147.94,Thank you.,241,,
949,0.97,7147.94,7154.447,You answered one of my question which is is a so one time fee and nominal to cover basic administrative costs incurred.,241,,
950,0.97,7154.447,7168.461,I know it is--we have the ability to make it an annual fee and I appreciate that it is a one-time fee.,241,,
951,0.97,7168.461,7198.758,The other question I wanted to tease out as it sounded like the most important benefit is as it currently stands if you have solar on your garage and another on your benefit the benefit could only be used on your garage.,241,,
952,0.97,7198.758,7202.194,This change will allow that energy generation from your garage to also be used on your home.,241,,
953,0.97,7202.194,7202.795,Is that correct?,241,,
954,0.97,7202.795,7203.062,Yes.,242,,
955,0.97,7203.062,7213.372,With rooftop solar generation is limited to the rooftop size so that allows for people to have a system that is more in line with their home energy consumption.,242,,
956,0.97,7213.372,7232.024,"And for a fact, we have two people who have taken up this option so it's not a high demand, no black Friday rush to take advantage of it but I expect over time we will get more customers.",243,,
957,0.97,7232.024,7236.929,"Excuse me, Councilmember Herbold.",244,,
958,0.97,7236.929,7265.424,Maybe I should've waited but I had a constituent contact me about the fact that they were producing more energy than they needed both--including where you would Bank the access energy.,244,,
959,0.97,7265.424,7269.028,They did not use all that in the winter months.,244,,
960,0.97,7269.028,7290.583,My recollection was they got a response to the issue that the practices that they don't pay customers for overproducing energy . am assuming that is still the case even with this proposal before us today.,244,,
961,0.97,7290.583,7312.104,If that particular individual had another structure perhaps I Culd contact that constituent and find out if there is another structure and if they want to apply what is in their bank toward the cost associated with energy in the other structure.,244,,
962,0.97,7312.104,7327.319,Mostly I want to confirm that the policy is going to remain that we are not going to pay customers for overproducing energy beyond their ability to use it when they bank that?,244,,
963,0.97,7327.319,7328.12,That is correct.,245,,
964,0.97,7328.12,7346.005,We feel that the change to the solar year will actually benefit those individuals who end the year with out anything left in their bank.,245,,
965,0.97,7346.005,7358.017,We have very few customers who have a bank at the end of the year and that gets dissolved back to the utility.,245,,
966,0.97,7358.017,7361.053,"There is no cash out at the end of the year, that is correct.",245,,
967,0.97,7361.053,7361.454,Thank you.,246,,
968,0.97,7361.454,7362.655,Please continue.,247,,
969,0.97,7362.655,7373.432,So it will edit the municipal code and as a result of that edit we don't expect any budgetary impacts from either item and so very minor impacts.,248,,
970,0.97,7373.432,7381.674,Thank you I thank you for your presentation.,249,,
971,0.97,7381.674,7386.979,Any final questions before we vote on item 5?,249,,
972,0.97,7386.979,7388.881,Okay.,250,,
973,0.97,7388.881,7401.06,Councilmembers I move for passage of Council bill 119871.,250,,

987,0.97,7452.645,7454.246,Council bill 119885.,259,,
988,0.97,7454.246,7474.099,In order and Vince amending section 2149 084 the Seattle municipal code to enable of broader sweep of voluntary renewable energy options to city light customers.,259,,
989,0.97,7474.099,7474.767,Thank you.,260,,
990,0.97,7474.767,7478.971,General manager Smith?,260,,
991,0.97,7478.971,7483.542,You are on matt mute.,261,,
992,0.97,7483.542,7484.743,I appreciate that.,262,,
993,0.97,7484.743,7499.792,"Again, this is another small piece of legislation but it will give us increased flexibility and allow us to be more responsive to customers.",262,,
994,0.97,7499.792,7500.392,Lori will present.,262,,
995,0.97,7500.392,7501.594,Before turn it over to her.,262,,
996,0.97,7501.594,7511.604,I wanted to check in and see if Craig Smith wanted to have anything to say since he is on the call.,262,,
997,0.97,7511.604,7516.008,And he is silent.,263,,
998,0.97,7516.008,7522.481,I will take silence as permission to move forward and turn this over to LORI again.,263,,
999,0.97,7522.481,7529.622,"By the way, I really appreciate you all hanging in there with us.",263,,
1000,0.97,7529.622,7531.09,I know we are running a bit late.,263,,
1001,0.97,7531.09,7535.594,We are very thankful that you all carved out the time . Thank you.,263,,
1002,0.97,7535.594,7535.928,Lori?,264,,
1003,0.97,7535.928,7538.13,Okay.,265,,
1004,0.97,7538.13,7550.743,So voluntary green power it purchases a renewable energy program.,265,,
1005,0.97,7550.743,7551.343,This one is fun.,265,,
1006,0.97,7551.343,7553.212,As you know Seattle city light is green power.,265,,
1007,0.97,7553.212,7564.757,We have had our long history of Hydroelectricity and since 2005 we have been carbon neutral.,265,,
1008,0.97,7564.757,7581.64,These programs allow our customers to go beyond what we already provide them with and support the growth of renewable energy in their local communities and in some cases a result and some beautiful our work which I think you are familiar with the sonic bloom.,265,,
1009,0.97,7581.64,7587.146,So go ahead and present the next slide.,265,,
1010,0.97,7587.146,7590.382,"Again, this is a two decade long journey that we have that for renewable energy.",265,,
1011,0.97,7590.382,7610.903,It started off with requirements by the state of Washington to require utilities to offer a voluntary program to purchase energy resources.,265,,
1012,0.97,7610.903,7615.24,The first program we initiated actually took the qualified alternative energy resources component and added another element which was demonstration projects.,265,,
1013,0.97,7615.24,7636.729,While customers would subscribe to purchase qualified resources which was additive above and beyond what they would get from their electric bill and kilowatt hours supplied by city light.,265,,
1014,0.97,7636.729,7639.498,Dollars would go to by alternative energy resources and invest in demonstration projects.,265,,
1015,0.97,7639.498,7641.734,You have probably seen one of these projects somewhere throughout the city.,265,,
1016,0.97,7641.734,7650.309,Like I showed in the first slide this famous what is sonic bloom.,265,,
1017,0.97,7650.309,7660.653,Another reputable one is the solar installation on the soup.,265,,
1018,0.97,7660.653,7672.131,"That program, because it had the demonstration project and it actually closed in 2011 because a secondary program had been adopted to clearly allocate and give customers the opportunity to buy renewable energy credits.",265,,
1019,0.97,7672.131,7675.534,So let's go to the second slide.,265,,
1020,0.97,7675.534,7689.081,Green up was established in 2005.,265,,
1021,0.97,7689.081,7704.897,That was intended to be a very Traightforward and simple W for customers to purchase qualified renewable energy credits more aligned with the market rate and again additional things to provide feedback on what portfolio of renewable energy they would like to purchase.,265,,
1022,0.97,7704.897,7705.964,We have a very simple formula.,265,,
1023,0.97,7705.964,7718.877,It is a 369 dollar contribution for commercial customers it can be a little bit more creative and flexible.,265,,
1024,0.97,7718.877,7720.379,We have operated this program since 2005.,265,,
1025,0.97,7720.379,7726.985,During the time when we have authority to do creative things we continued the demonstration projects.,265,,
1026,0.97,7726.985,7747.005,"When the green power purchase program ended and green up was are so Paul Graham we had to line all of our programs to purchasing renewable energy credits which, in order to be qualified you have to go through a few hoops and there is a certification body.",265,,
1027,0.97,7747.005,7752.244,Usually it is not closely aligned to smaller project.,265,,
1028,0.97,7752.244,7763.856,"Despite that this program has really supported, as I said in my original presentation a number of local renewable projects in schools.",265,,
1029,0.97,7763.856,7766.992,We have done seven schools with Seattle public school districts.,265,,
1030,0.97,7766.992,7784.543,We are working--we have funded Harborview and the specific Pacific science center and currently the program is working with affordable housing as our focus.,265,,
1031,0.97,7784.543,7797.756,We have for projects identified in New constructions on a demonstration pilot and an additional eight projects in the affordable housing sector.,265,,
1032,0.97,7797.756,7807.399,All of these projects will be--the purchase of the credits which actually occur once a projects are up and running.,265,,
1033,0.97,7807.399,7851.81,"So, as we have talked to two customers and looked at their interest in funding renewable energy in our community, there is an interest to go back to a place where it is not just renewable energy credits they are purchasing but more of a direct funding of some of these local projects and in particularly on affordable housing.",265,,
1034,0.97,7851.81,7854.479,So the proposed changes that we have are really to allow some flexibility.,265,,
1035,0.97,7854.479,7859.484,The first thing is that the municipal code uses green up as a product and we feel that is branded to the renewable energy credits.,265,,
1036,0.97,7859.484,7880.105,"We would like to remove that from the ordinance and the second pieces that we would like to add a section to the ordinance, not taking away from anything that currently exist but allows us to offer a product that does not ally with the resources.",265,,
1037,0.97,7880.105,7882.407,These would still be permitted under our rules and regulations.,265,,
1038,0.97,7882.407,7885.077,They would comply with all of our net metering and aggregation program requirements.,265,,
1039,0.97,7885.077,7894.486,They would allow for customers to opt into funding things that are little bit more creative and flexible and in particular we perceive of focus here on providing solar and low income communities and affordable housing.,265,,
1040,0.97,7894.486,7926.918,"So once again, these programs are fully funded by voluntary contributions, customers select their level of participation.",266,,
1041,0.97,7926.918,7928.787,"That participation rate is around 14,000 customers per year.",266,,
1042,0.97,7928.787,7929.588,It has been very steady.,266,,
1043,0.97,7929.588,7933.525,We have a lot of customers who are outspoken in this area and very interested in supporting the community.,266,,
1044,0.97,7933.525,7934.893,"Again, no financial impacts to these changes.",266,,
1045,0.97,7934.893,7935.694,Councilmember Strauss?,267,,
1046,0.97,7935.694,7936.628,Thank you.,268,,
1047,0.97,7936.628,7940.932,Thank you.,268,,
1048,0.97,7940.932,7944.636,"If you could switch back to slide 3 and 4, I wanted to hear little bit more.",268,,
1049,0.97,7944.636,8005.997,"I understand that we are ensuring the correct voltages on our network to be able to provide electricity to all of--to have the correct load for neck work and we have to make blind purchases of electricity on the market which in turn means that we are purchasing dirty electricity from carbon Polluting sources and that city light does such an excellent job of offsetting these purchases by purchasing carbon credits to offset these purchases, can you share with us how that ability for us to keep city light carbon neutral is different and separate from this green effort program?",268,,
1050,0.97,8005.997,8006.565,Yes.,269,,
1051,0.97,8006.565,8008.834,We actually have an individual who oversees our carbon neutrality program.,269,,
1052,0.97,8008.834,8010.669,I believe that is part of the integrated resource plan.,269,,
1053,0.97,8010.669,8014.106,Those are wholesale market purchases at park bulk levels.,269,,
1054,0.97,8014.106,8017.709,The purchases we make through the green up programmer 26 million can make it out watts per year.,269,,
1055,0.97,8017.709,8021.48,Nowhere near what we purchase for city light system requirements.,269,,
1056,0.97,8021.48,8024.349,They have two separate programs.,269,,
1057,0.97,8024.349,8041.099,"They may buy renewable energy from the same projects, but they are--what we purchase for the renewable energy program is customer driven.",269,,
1058,0.97,8041.099,8042.134,It is not Ratepayer based.,269,,
1059,0.97,8042.134,8042.534,Thank you.,270,,
1060,0.97,8042.534,8068.727,"So what you're saying is that this is--I might be just calling it out, this is an additional fee or charge that a customer is voluntarily paying so that we are able to create a more green electrical network?",270,,
1061,0.97,8068.727,8069.161,Is that correct?,270,,
1062,0.97,8069.161,8074.966,So the customer is opting into an additional fees for the green network?,270,,
1063,0.97,8074.966,8081.139,They are opting into an additional fee to support renewable energy in our region and also in our local community.,271,,
1064,0.97,8081.139,8082.974,They don't expect this to come to their home.,271,,
1065,0.97,8082.974,8083.308,Excellent.,272,,
1066,0.97,8083.308,8088.647,And Craig or Mike can Chime in here if they would like to add perspective.,273,,
1067,0.97,8088.647,8088.947,Okay.,273,,
1068,0.97,8088.947,8102.127,So the programs are distinct programs.,273,,
1069,0.97,8102.127,8116.875,This program today we are talking about is funded by customers and the additional flexibility is consistent with what a lot of utilities use too.,273,,
1070,0.97,8116.875,8117.909,I worked for a long time.,273,,
1071,0.97,8117.909,8121.513,Those customers have the ability to sign up and then they vote on projects they want to fun.,273,,
1072,0.97,8121.513,8134.726,Everyone who participates in the program gets to vote on community projects that allow generally Nonprofits or schools to install infrastructure they perhaps otherwise would not be able to do.,273,,
1073,0.97,8134.726,8160.952,"The greenhouse natural gas is purchased projects . It is not a [inaudible]. It is more, in order to get credit for greening they have to have investments in green resources or projects that would otherwise not be done . It is the same concept.",273,,
1074,0.97,8160.952,8178.57,It is greening and offsetting carbon impacts for the resources you are Procuring to serve load and you are doing that with specific projects that bring value to the larger region.,273,,
1075,0.97,8178.57,8189.481,"And, those are funds that are budgeted each year and they are embedded in and they are part of the revenue requirement we use.",273,,
1076,0.97,8189.481,8199.724,Thank you.,274,,
1077,0.97,8200.025,8200.859,That is helpful clarification.,274,,
1078,0.97,8200.859,8206.698,"I would like the record to reflect that for the second time in the past 30 days we are taking public policy direction from the city of Eugene, Oregon.",274,,
1079,0.97,8206.698,8207.532,Thank you.,274,,
1080,0.97,8207.532,8212.17,My apologies.,275,,
1081,0.97,8212.17,8221.913,I did have one second question one slide 4. there we go.,275,,
1082,0.97,8221.913,8240.999,"Can you share with us if we are not using the Rcw determined qualifications for new programs, can you share--you mentioned a little bit about where some of the Metrics are that you are using to identify what qualifies in this project.",275,,
1083,0.97,8240.999,8247.205,Can you clearly share with us what qualifications are we using to determine which programs are eligible?,275,,
1084,0.97,8247.205,8263.755,There is a definition in the Rcw defining a qualified project and everything we do fits under that definition.,276,,
1085,0.97,8263.755,8272.297,What is different is that we are not engaging as certified body to certify that the projects qualify.,276,,
1086,0.97,8272.297,8293.318,That is an administrative burden when you are doing something like a small 10 Kw project to go through the project requirements to become certified by Regis.,276,,
1087,0.97,8294.653,8295.787,That is where the burden is.,276,,
1088,0.97,8295.787,8311.336,These projects will be fully qualified as renewable energy projects through all of our codes and inspections and Validations and the kilowatt hours will be tracked in our system and accounted for . The only difference is that we are not engaging in third parties to Walk-Through procedures to qualify them.,276,,
1089,0.97,8311.336,8312.604,Thank you.,277,,
1090,0.97,8312.604,8315.006,Very helpful.,277,,
1091,0.97,8315.006,8317.175,Okay.,278,,
1092,0.97,8317.175,8326.985,Let's wrap this one up.,278,,
1093,0.97,8326.985,8329.721,Okay.,278,,
1094,0.97,8329.721,8331.289,Thank you and thank you for the questions.,278,,
1095,0.97,8331.289,8333.825,Any final questions before we take this to a vote?,278,,
1096,0.97,8333.825,8334.225,Okay.,279,,

1126,0.97,8476.434,8498.356,We are here to talk about the Madison rapid G line and we are here today in final preparations for receiving a small grant from the Federal Government and from there I will get into the details.,291,,
1127,0.97,8498.356,8511.736,So we will go through project background to set the stage and review the schedule and then get right to the proposal which is why we are here today and then we will follow up with question.,291,,
1128,0.97,8511.736,8512.003,Okay.,292,,
1129,0.97,8512.003,8525.617,"As we usually do, our mission and core values, this project addresses equities, safety, Sustainability and we are hitting on all accounts with this project.",292,,
1130,0.97,8525.617,8551.943,"So the purpose and need, so this project including quite a bit of capital improvement along the line that you see highlighted in blue, it will provide fast, frequent and reliable service from downtown through the Madison valley.",293,,
1131,0.97,8551.943,8558.95,"It will serve neighborhoods experiencing rapid growth and historically Underserved and will connect riders to dozens of other bus routes, the light rail and ferry services.",293,,

1134,0.97,8571.462,8578.97,So this is one of the Premier projects coming out of move Seattle.,295,,
1135,0.97,8578.97,8583.241,They will be operating it as rapid ride G and it has the key features of the rapid ride program.,295,,
1136,0.97,8583.241,8594.252,Buses will be frequent throughout the day operating and arriving every six minutes during the day and that's Monday through Saturday and 15 minutes in the evening and on Sunday.,295,,
1137,0.97,8594.252,8603.161,There will be raised platforms and pavement to make loading faster and easier.,295,,
1138,0.97,8603.161,8619.41,Between five and 12 Avenue the platforms will run on the inside lanes so they have more or less interaction with other traffic including travel time.,295,,
1139,0.97,8619.41,8632.623,The travel time is expected to improve by about 35% going down to 7.5 minutes on the Westbound direction.,295,,
1140,0.97,8632.623,8644.402,"Finally, the project includes improvements to access for pedestrians and cyclists.",295,,
1141,0.97,8644.402,8664.956,The image on the lower right of the slide shows the intersection of Union and 12 Avenue where we are making improvements to pedestrians so they can access the station there as well as carrying bicycles through a protected section through that intersection connecting to the Union Tbl that is under construction this year.,295,,
1142,0.97,8664.956,8675.066,The project includes enhancements for utilities.,296,,
1143,0.97,8675.066,8687.512,There will be a new water main installed east of Broadway . The new sewer main as well east of Broadway and the city of light is constructing this project in the first Hill area.,296,,
1144,0.97,8687.512,8700.324,"So little bit of background, the city council approved this alternative in 2016.",297,,
1145,0.97,8700.324,8712.87,This project was approved into the FDA's small starts program as well later in 2016.,297,,
1146,0.97,8712.87,8724.015,We completed our environmental assessment and documented Exclusions and it was approved by the end of 2017.,297,,
1147,0.97,8724.015,8728.286,Last year the FDA assigned a project management oversight consultant to this project.,297,,
1148,0.97,8728.286,8743.201,That is part of their standard approach for their capital investments grants program projects including small starts to go through this oversight process.,297,,
1149,0.97,8743.201,8766.057,"Their consultant looks at the overall risk, capacity and capability to deliver the project to ensure the funds they are giving us are going to be used wisely at tune and to complete the project.",297,,
1150,0.97,8766.057,8767.492,We received input after risk assessment.,297,,
1151,0.97,8767.492,8777.235,The initial assessment had some recommendations including a recommendation to increase the overall risk I'm sorry contingency consistent with FDA requirements.,297,,
1152,0.97,8777.235,8786.377,We also updated the project management plan in response to their recommendations including adding a full staffing plan for construction and sub plans that needed to be documented.,297,,
1153,0.97,8786.377,8814.872,"So at the end of June, the Pmo see issued their final report and that concluded that we have the resources and capacity to plan, develop and complete the project as well, they confirmed we had addressed all the other findings.",297,,
1154,0.97,8814.872,8821.712,The Pmo see did identify a few things we need to complete before we go into the grant and those are going to be gone over by Loralee in the next slide.,298,,
1155,0.97,8821.712,8837.528,Next steps are the amendment to the CIP which is what we are here to talk about the day and that amendment incorporates the contingency that came out of the process with the Pmo see.,299,,
1156,0.97,8837.528,8852.81,The St3 package approved by voters in 2016 includes funding which is the second item you see here.,299,,
1157,0.97,8852.81,8854.245,They are ready and waiting for action.,299,,
1158,0.97,8854.245,8861.852,It is now included in their larger assessment of cash flow funding decisions affected by Covid-19.,299,,
1159,0.97,8861.852,8883.674,The Mayor has contacted son transit and urge them to move this agreement forward as soon as possible . After anticipated station of this the funding agreement will be the only thing that remains.,299,,
1160,0.97,8883.674,8898.456,"So, once those steps are complete then FDA will prepare their grant agreement and we are targeting and have been targeting the end of the year for executing this agreement.",299,,
1161,0.97,8898.456,8913.504,We are getting a read from the FDA that it is going to be very difficult to achieve considering everything going on and the election etc.,299,,
1162,0.97,8913.504,8923.08,We are still maintaining that is our target until and if we are unable to meet it and we will move forward from there.,299,,
1163,0.97,8923.08,8925.716,Then following the execution we would advertise for construction.,299,,
1164,0.97,8925.716,8933.824,We are not recommending advertising for construction in advance of receiving the grant agreement.,299,,
1165,0.97,8933.824,8947.004,Sometimes we have those and it can get a letter allowing you to proceed and that would require us to have a plan to fulfill the 60 million.,299,,
1166,0.97,8947.004,8963.12,Right now the focus is getting the grant agreement and then advertise for construction.,299,,
1167,0.97,8963.12,8968.726,This would go into 2021 and then incorporate the improved schedule for the project and revenue service would start in the third quarter of 2024.,299,,
1168,0.97,8968.726,8985.042,"Our amendment to the CIP on this slide, you can see the 2020 CIP and the funds and amended proposal.",300,,
1169,0.97,8985.042,8991.949,This includes additional move Seattle funds and we would discuss the details of that on the next slide.,300,,
1170,0.97,8991.949,9004.362,"I also wanted to Callout the city transportation funds noted here including historical funds, some vehicle license fees and other funds such as that.",300,,
1171,0.97,9004.362,9009.0,They already are allocated and have been spent.,300,,
1172,0.97,9009.0,9011.002,Those are not the funds we expect to use going forward.,300,,
1173,0.97,9011.002,9021.379,We are working with our counterparts at City light to incorporate streetlight improvements into the projects you see.,300,,
1174,0.97,9021.379,9047.405,You can see the King County commitment connecting Washington grant and those all remain the same and then we have the sound transit 3 agreement that we were just discussing and that increase has been discussed and agreed to at South transit and that needs to go to the approval board.,300,,
1175,0.97,9047.405,9064.455,Then we have the small Star stands agreement and are see matt grant.,300,,
1176,0.97,9064.455,9068.926,"So then specifically noting that changes in the CIP, an increase to the sub transit amount of about 7.2 million.",301,,
1177,0.97,9068.926,9071.629,"As far as move Seattle, both changes are to address contingencies through the review.",301,,
1178,0.97,9071.629,9082.139,We had Savings and Abridge separation project.,301,,
1179,0.97,9082.139,9091.482,"That will be moved over to this project to fill that crap and 916,000 in money that won't be spent on [inaudible] due to the positive nature of that work?",301,,
1180,0.97,9091.482,9097.988,Thank you for these--showing the sources of funds.,302,,
1181,0.97,9097.988,9106.464,Úthat is important for the viewing audience to see the vast majority of these funds are Non-City funds.,302,,
1182,0.97,9106.464,9126.217,"However, a couple of issues of concern for me, filling the gap based on what you are hearing from the Federal Government on what they want to see more of in this budget, filling the gap did come from city funds.",302,,
1183,0.97,9126.217,9160.251,"Seeing the move Seattle money, the 20 $20 amount and 15 million going up to 19 million, Im--one benefit of this project is that most of the money comes from other sources other than city government but that makes this transit money imperative to fund this and at sound transit we are struggling through the pandemic and with Ridership down and their own budget deficit.",302,,
1184,0.97,9160.251,9198.489,"If the sound transit money is unavailable I want to signal my concern that while this allocation of city dollars makes sense to satisfy the Federal Government and have a more realistic budget, I want to have my personal concerns about not having additional city dollars into this project until we have another discussion about this and broader transportation issues and what our priorities are in all levels of government.",302,,
1185,0.97,9198.489,9200.758,I know you would have to come back to Council for that.,302,,
1186,0.97,9200.758,9214.905,I just wanted to flag that while I support this reallocation if there has to be another reallocation that might be a concern especially when we just heard about the bridge audit and showing the needs we have regarding bridge.,302,,
1187,0.97,9214.905,9220.678,Council member Herbold had to go to another appointment.,302,,
1188,0.97,9220.678,9236.126,She has concerns about the money nearly 1 million coming out of the project from West Seattle to supplement this.,302,,
1189,0.97,9236.126,9240.531,So I just wanted to flag that for you and I am sure she will talk to you off-line about that.,302,,
1190,0.97,9240.531,9240.864,Thank you.,302,,
1191,0.97,9240.864,9241.865,Councilmember straps?,303,,
1192,0.97,9241.865,9248.706,Thank you.,304,,
1193,0.97,9248.706,9250.107,I'm looking for that Unmute button.,304,,
1194,0.97,9250.107,9250.407,Thank you.,304,,
1195,0.97,9250.407,9257.448,I just wanted to center or focus in on your last comment about needing another discussion if city dollars were to be used.,304,,
1196,0.97,9257.448,9258.983,I think that is fair and appropriate.,304,,
1197,0.97,9258.983,9271.962,"I do want to signal my strong support for this project in particular, this one has a high level priority for me even though it's not in my district.",304,,
1198,0.97,9271.962,9278.969,This project really is one of those key connections of moving [inaudible] of people.,304,,
1199,0.97,9278.969,9286.076,Once we are past covert.,304,,
1200,0.97,9286.076,9287.678,I am more and more convinced that will happen.,304,,
1201,0.97,9287.678,9308.365,"When we do return to a more standard style livelihood where we are using transit more readily, this bus route is very important for us to have operational as soon as possible.",304,,
1202,0.97,9308.365,9318.175,I'm just signaling my support for using what we understand as transportation restricted dollars to support this project because bus rapid transit is different from rapid ride.,304,,
1203,0.97,9318.175,9329.62,There are additional elements utilized and this project on Madison gets us so much closer to that.,304,,
1204,0.97,9329.62,9365.522,"I will signal that Eugene has a true bus rapid transit system and their system has its own dedicated lanes, level platforms, on door boarding and all of these elements use a single line and that allows for transfer frequency plus or minus about three minutes as composed . We need to be able to Rollout the people without using cars.",304,,
1205,0.97,9365.522,9370.761,Rapid ride is absolutely necessary for us.,304,,
1206,0.97,9370.761,9387.845,Signaling that I support this and additional discussion to save dollars and signaling that I support this project with a high level of priority.,304,,
1207,0.97,9387.845,9388.145,Thank you.,304,,
1208,0.97,9388.145,9389.113,Thank you.,305,,
1209,0.97,9389.113,9409.967,"If I may, one request I do have, as this goes to the full council is for the city budget office to put this additional information we see on the slides into the fiscal note.",306,,
1210,0.97,9409.967,9412.803,The fiscal NOTE is not showing the sources and uses of funds in their totality.,306,,
1211,0.97,9412.803,9414.805,Here we have a nice snap shot of the sources.,306,,
1212,0.97,9414.805,9431.054,This is not in the fiscal NOTE and I would like to see it in the fiscal NOTE and the uses of funds.,306,,
1213,0.97,9431.054,9434.625,"We should see a breakout of design construction cost of the buses, how much was Street refer fencing.",306,,
1214,0.97,9434.625,9439.83,We need to see that for the benefit of the public.,306,,
1215,0.97,9439.83,9440.431,I would appreciate that.,306,,
1216,0.97,9440.431,9441.432,Okay.,307,,
1217,0.97,9441.432,9460.35,"And responding to your comment, we are expecting at this point that some transit will move dashed take action next week to move things forward with a full review by the board in October.",307,,
1218,0.97,9460.35,9461.985,Things are moving in a positive direction.,307,,
1219,0.97,9461.985,9462.82,Thank you.,308,,
1220,0.97,9462.82,9469.126,May I make a quick little remark?,309,,
1221,0.97,9469.126,9469.86,"Yes, please.",310,,
1222,0.97,9469.86,9477.534,I don't want to Belabor the point but I also want to signal my support for moving in this direction.,310,,
1223,0.97,9477.534,9507.097,"I acknowledge that there has been intensive work done to see this project come to fruition and where we are all sitting and sheltering in place right now for not just covert reason, the massive climate crisis since those that we are experiencing currently through the air quality impacts as a result of the Wildfires.",310,,
1224,0.97,9507.097,9533.49,I just think it is so important for us to address the due process issues that Congress member Pederson has to remain to investing and these public transit projects are key strategies.,310,,
1225,0.97,9533.49,9550.14,Im looking forward to continuing to support these efforts and to working with colleagues on making sure that underlying concerns about how to make the investment sustainable are brought to fruition.,310,,
1226,0.97,9550.14,9558.882,Thank you to the chair and S.And others . I really appreciate it.,310,,
1227,0.97,9558.882,9564.922,I appreciate this.,311,,

1232,0.97,9578.168,9579.036,Anything else?,313,,
1233,0.97,9579.036,9585.275,I think we covered our questions and comments.,314,,
1234,0.97,9585.275,9595.786,"If there is nothing else further, we will look forward to that heaved up fiscal NOTE when it advances forward, which I think it will.",314,,
1235,0.97,9595.786,9598.989,Any final comments before we vote on this?,314,,
