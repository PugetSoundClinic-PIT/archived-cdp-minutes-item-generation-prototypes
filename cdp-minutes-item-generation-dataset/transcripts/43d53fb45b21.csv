298,0.97,1779.511,1784.048,That's why this week I had a different number than last week.,43,,
299,0.97,1784.048,1793.057,We put people first and our outreach make Untran workers out there trying to get folks inside rather than filling out paperwork.,43,,

303,0.97,1810.141,1814.412,"To your point you're making, absolutely.",43,,
304,0.97,1814.412,1824.422,"People choose single occupancy offers at a much higher rate than our 24/7 enhanced shelter, better than basics but still a living situation.",43,,
305,0.97,1824.422,1849.681,"To be clear, the point I was trying to make is that when ever we have one of these significant outreach operations for large encampment, as you illustrated last week, the asset in our enhanced shelter system that isn't in high demand and people wants to utilize and in term allows them to move out of a park.",44,,
306,0.97,1849.681,1853.985,Time after time is the tiny House village.,44,,
307,0.97,1853.985,1857.488,It's the same we saw with Ballard comments.,44,,
308,0.97,1857.488,1862.393,"We've seen it with dinner Lake, woodland park and others throughout the city.",44,,
309,0.97,1862.393,1874.305,"When we have available capacity and tiny houses, we're able to have communities where people have an alternative to living in an encampment.",44,,
310,0.97,1874.305,1893.791,I wanted to El brought overwhelming majority of people that moved on from woodland park did so because there were available tiny houses and continue as a city to support that model and support having that capacity in the system aloes us to help people live somewhere that duct know the encampment.,44,,
311,0.97,1893.791,1896.728,I wasn't trying to blind side you knowing how many there were.,44,,
312,0.97,1896.728,1900.331,I know it was the over Weaponing number.,44,,
313,0.97,1900.331,1905.703,It was in the mid to high 60s.,44,,
314,0.97,1905.703,1911.242,It ill operating our about to do those operations con Ting Gent on tiny House capacity.,44,,

318,0.97,1918.249,1929.761,"Having gone down to build a tiny home with foundations Northwest placed at tiny home village, it was an honor to get to help put those walls together.",45,,
319,0.97,1929.761,1941.039,It's also clear in my mind and knowledge that it is the fact that it is a single occupancy dwelling that is most important to folks.,45,,
320,0.97,1941.039,1941.539,Council member Herbolt.,45,,
321,0.97,1941.539,1942.607,Thank you very much.,46,,
322,0.97,1942.607,1945.51,I don't want to turn this into a committee meeting.,46,,

326,0.97,1954.852,1965.763,I know that this is an area that there are things to try and there's again things to learn from.,47,,
327,0.97,1965.763,1976.207,I'm wondering whether or not in this particular engagement folks were given an opportunity to visit a tiny House village before making that decision.,47,,
328,0.97,1976.207,1980.078,"If you have anything to share about that, if that's the case.",47,,
329,0.97,1980.078,1990.121,Is the reputation of a tiny House village one that people were able to commit to sight unseen.,47,,
330,0.97,1990.121,1996.26,We're preparing for a similar engagement but different population of folks in my district.,47,,
331,0.97,1996.26,2001.833,These are largely folks who are living in Rvs.,47,,
332,0.97,2001.833,2008.539,"As I will report in remarks later, we did a site visit today.",47,,
333,0.97,2008.539,2020.151,"From my individual conversations with people, it seems people might be more open to the idea if they were able to like we do when we rent an as Apartmentment or visit a house.",47,,
334,0.97,2020.151,2029.027,Did the city make accommodations to help people visit a tiny House village as part of this long process you've been engaged in?,47,,
335,0.97,2029.027,2031.162,Not to my knowledge.,48,,
336,0.97,2031.162,2031.896,Could have happened there.,48,,
337,0.97,2031.896,2038.469,What I can tell you is there were a couple of folks that went to a tiny home village.,48,,
338,0.97,2038.469,2040.772,It wasn't the right fit for them.,48,,
339,0.97,2040.772,2045.41,They came back and we were able to figure out for them.,48,,
340,0.97,2045.41,2046.911,This is Council member Lewis' point as well.,48,,
341,0.97,2046.911,2054.318,This is the shelter and what I have the King County regional authority said at the shelter last week.,48,,
342,0.97,2054.318,2059.257,This was the resource available to us at the time of the ending of phase 3.,48,,
