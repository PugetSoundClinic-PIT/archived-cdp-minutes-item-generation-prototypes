8,0.97,46.045,49.449,Councilmember Lewis?,7,,
9,0.97,49.449,50.049,Present.,8,,
10,0.97,50.049,56.222,Councilmember Juarez? four present.,9,,
11,0.97,56.222,68.234,Thank you and welcome all members of the committee and to Councilmembers Mosqueda and Pedersen who will be joining us as sponsors of either legislation or amendments to legislation.,10,,
12,0.97,68.234,86.052,"We have three items on the agenda, the committee will discuss and vote on a bill sponsored by Councilmember Pedersen to add information about rent charged to the information that landlords are required to report under the rental registration and inspection ordinance.",10,,
13,0.97,86.052,123.456,"Council member Pedersen hasn't been met to clarify how it will be enforced and the committee will discuss a bill sponsored by my office in response to a court of Appeals decision that objected to one small part of the Seattle Six- month Eviction defense which requires landlords--sorry, Renters to assess they have suffered financial hardship to be eligible to use the defense against Eviction and the court of Appeals objected to the mechanics of that station, specifically that there is not language giving landlords the ability to rebut the claim that Renters face financial hardship.",10,,
14,0.97,123.456,163.196,"I want to be clear that the Eviction defense is in effect because the city has appealed the court of Appeals decision, however, out of an abundance of caution, particularly to avoid confusion, my office is sponsoring the bill to respond to the court of Appeals concerts and there are two ways to address the decision by the court of Appeals, the city council could add a light explaining how landlords can rebut the claims by Renters of financial hardship, or the Council could remove the requirement that Renters have faced financial hardship, that the requirement Renters have to claim that so that there is no claim to rebut.",10,,
15,0.97,163.196,185.718,"As I have argued repeatedly in the past, I strongly prefer that we have no elements of means testing, however minor in the Renters rights legislation and I strongly prefer the second option, it should be given that if a Renter is an Eviction court, they have suffered financial hardship because nobody in their right mind would be in Eviction court out of choice.",10,,
16,0.97,185.718,192.425,Why else would they be there other than if they had financial hardship?,10,,
17,0.97,192.425,226.96,"Requiring that they declare financial hardship, particularly if the landlord challenges the claim, drags Renters regulating process that, in reality, has a chilling effect rent--preventing people, this defense was intended to help in the first place, from using it and there is documentary evidence to show how the process overwhelmingly is in balance towards protecting landlords because they feel--because landlords are much more experienced in dealing with legal processes.",10,,
18,0.97,226.96,253.586,"My office has discussed with the housing justice project to defend Renters in Eviction court on this Eviction defense is rarely needed right now because both Renters and landlords usually prefer a different Eviction defense connected to rental assistance money to pay off back rent but those programs are only funded to the end of June and hopefully be extended, in the meantime, this bill will clarify the next line of defense for Renters.",10,,
19,0.97,253.586,272.271,"Because legislation requires 20 days after signature by the Mayor to go into effect, if the bill is passed, I intend to move to suspend the rules to have it appear on Tuesday of next week and the city council agenda, rather than the following week as would typically happen for legislation.",10,,
20,0.97,272.271,284.517,"There are two ways this bill could have responded to the court of Appeals concerning, the bill I have proposed response by eliminating the needs for any means test by the Renter.",10,,
21,0.97,284.517,300.199,"Councilmember Mosqueda has an amendment to instead use the other approach, adding a line about how landlords can rebut Renters . Our final agenda item is a report from the office of Sustainability and environment on their work in the recent social justice report.",10,,
22,0.97,300.199,306.205,"Before we begin, we have public comment.",10,,
23,0.97,306.205,315.114,"We have 11 people, 12 people now signed up--11 people now signed up for public comment.",10,,
24,0.97,315.114,332.398,"Because some members of the committee, city council members have scheduling restrictions, I am going to have speakers have one minute each, not two minutes, I apologize but we need Councilmembers here for as much of the committee as possible.",10,,
25,0.97,332.398,334.834,Public comments will have one minute each.,10,,
26,0.97,334.834,337.47,I will read out the names.,10,,
27,0.97,337.47,352.151,"You will be prompted when I call a grenade to Unmute, hit Star 6 on your phone to Unmute and begin speaking.",10,,
28,0.97,352.151,362.462,"Our first the Speaker shown is present are Jennifer, Candace, and Bruce Becker.",10,,
29,0.97,362.462,368.601,"Anthony is shown up as not present, if you can hear this, you are showed up as not present.",10,,
30,0.97,368.601,375.041,"Go ahead, Jennifer.",10,,
31,0.97,375.041,392.658,"Jennifer you are muted, hit Star 6 to Unmute yourself.",11,,
32,0.97,392.992,406.539,"Jennifer, you are still showing up as muted, hit Star 6 on your phone.",11,,
33,0.97,406.539,414.046,"Jennifer, I will move on and come back to you and see if that works then.",12,,
34,0.97,414.046,419.919,Anthony Jacob is still not present.,12,,
35,0.97,419.919,422.355,"Next is Candace, Bruce.",12,,
36,0.97,422.355,430.496,We have been joined by Councilmember Juarez who was also a member of the committee.,12,,
37,0.97,430.496,430.763,Go ahead.,12,,
38,0.97,430.763,435.568,"Thank you, Madam chair.",13,,
39,0.97,435.568,445.978,This is Candace and I would like to urge you to know on Council bill 120330 and 120325.,13,,
40,0.97,445.978,460.76,I wanted to mention that I represent a lot of apartment owners in the sale of their building and I can see how these regulations really affect their decision to sell versus continue to own the property.,13,,
41,0.97,460.76,471.337,This reporting would be really onerous on a smaller landlords which have the naturally occurring affordable housing that we so value in our city.,13,,
42,0.97,471.337,480.68,I also wanted to add that there is some talk about using a local research University for some of the research.,13,,
43,0.97,480.68,484.383,That is not be conducted and gathered.,13,,
44,0.97,484.383,493.86,"I started a company called commercial Analytics, which was intended to replace the void left by Dupree and Scott.",13,,
45,0.97,493.86,504.036,I wanted to make sure that the Council is aware there is an existing system that could be used in order to collect this data.,13,,
46,0.97,504.036,507.74,Feel free to contact me if you want more information.,13,,
47,0.97,507.74,510.509,I sent a written Email as well.,13,,
48,0.97,510.509,518.217,Next is Bruce Becker.,14,,
49,0.97,518.217,525.958,"Then Marilyn, then Rachel who is showing up is not present, then Tran Larson.",14,,
50,0.97,525.958,530.029,Thank you for having me.,15,,
51,0.97,530.029,552.184,"I am encouraging you to vote against most of these Council bills, first of all, the first one that eliminates the need for a--to show need, a financial need to avoid paying rent does not make sense.",15,,
52,0.97,552.184,562.128,"It is much better--if the tenant cannot pay, they should claim I cannot pay and this is why.",15,,
53,0.97,562.128,569.035,"If a landlord can rebut that successfully, that is good, that is what a judges for.",15,,
54,0.97,569.035,579.178,The problem is--it means that people do not need to pay rent to avoid Eviction.,15,,
55,0.97,579.178,583.649,The other bill presents a problem with the reporting.,15,,
56,0.97,583.649,593.592,These are the kinds of things driving small landlords like me out of Seattle and this is a problem because we provide local --,15,,
57,0.97,593.592,600.7,Maryland followed by Tran and Kate Martin.,16,,
58,0.97,600.7,638.504,"I am speaking in opposition to the two Council bills before you, January 2020, the housing choices report found that two thirds of Renters prefer renting one to four unit properties at three quarters of respondents want to be policy to encourage more options but the city has lost 11% of its rental housing, 94% of which is the very same properties the majority of Renters prefer, that same report cautioned against the data gathering it proposes and shows a Disconnect between the policy of the cities and actual outcomes for Renters and small Mom-And-Pop providers.",17,,
59,0.97,638.504,662.461,"City Council actions such as those considered they are driving out the very properties that most city residents want more of and you are not collecting data to figure out why this is happening you want to suspend rental payments indefinitely with no additional rental assistance when there are housing providers with $50,000- $100,000 right now, that is my mom and Pops right now are leaving, with harsh legislation but you are alienating us with today being a loose example.",17,,
60,0.97,662.461,667.9,Speak with Stakeholders and stop passing laws that make the housing crisis worse.,17,,
61,0.97,667.9,669.335,Thank you.,17,,
62,0.97,669.335,674.64,"Rachel, go ahead.",18,,
63,0.97,674.64,675.041,"After that, Tran.",18,,
64,0.97,675.041,689.722,I just wanted to call in and express the fact that I am considered a small landlord here and I do have two properties that recently became vacant.,19,,
65,0.97,689.722,711.61,Just the idea of expanding this moratorium puts me in a position where I will probably be choosing to sell my property as opposed to renting them out again because I cannot afford to not receive rental from my tenants.,19,,
66,0.97,711.61,721.187,I hope that you do consider how this affects small landlords and small property owners.,19,,
67,0.97,721.187,733.966,"Next is Tran Larson, then Kate Martin.",20,,
68,0.97,733.966,754.687,I am the community engagement manager of the housing jumped our project and on behalf of us we support the proposed ordinance to amend the language in the defense to an action to address the issue of the court of Appeals which is a relatively minor fix.,21,,
69,0.97,754.687,769.268,"Tenants are still struggling to pay rent as hours and wages are fluctuating with the rising Covid cases, the largest rental assistance program has close to--tenants have few resources, they are not just refusing to pay rent.",21,,
70,0.97,769.268,780.179,We support the ordinance from Council Pedersen that supports the collection of information on landlords claims that they are selling the properties when we don't have any evidence that supports these claims aside from misinterpretation of the little information that is there.,21,,
71,0.97,780.179,790.156,It is beneficial to know what the housing inventory looks like and what action the city needs to take to preserve the affordable housing and address the debt that exists.,21,,
72,0.97,790.156,790.456,Thank you.,21,,
73,0.97,790.456,800.799,"Next is Kate Martin and then Gordon, the Speaker after that is Daniel, but you are showing is not present.",22,,
74,0.97,800.799,803.836,"Go ahead, Kate Martin.",22,,
75,0.97,803.836,811.877,I would like to make a few comments to my opposition to extending the moratorium on Evictions.,23,,
76,0.97,811.877,826.225,"I am a small landlord running a shared house that I own, I have very affordable rent and it has put me in a terrible position to not be able to rent rooms because of the idea of a rent strike.",23,,
77,0.97,826.225,832.898,"As you know, in New York City, they ended the Eviction moratorium a long time ago.",23,,
78,0.97,832.898,851.584,"Is separated the wheat from the Chaff, separated the rent strikers from the people who legitimately needed help, and it has not caused a tsunami of anything to happen in the United States's largest city and I want you to consider ending that right now.",23,,
79,0.97,851.584,862.962,We have lost over 5000 small landlord housing options because of the risk that we face to have strikers in our homes and in our apartments.,23,,
80,0.97,862.962,867.633,It is unsustainable and I'm asking you to end it now.,23,,
81,0.97,867.633,869.235,Thank you.,23,,
82,0.97,869.235,878.377,"Gordon Haggerty, go ahead.",24,,
83,0.97,878.377,885.951,"Hello, this is Gordon Haggerty and I have been a small housing provider for over 50 years.",25,,
84,0.97,885.951,892.992,I have had great success with tenant relations and have not had to do Evictions.,25,,
85,0.97,892.992,894.426,We have been able to work this out.,25,,
86,0.97,894.426,911.377,"But what you are doing, I am in opposition of both of these Council bills, and I will send written comments in more detail, but I just have to say I am strongly opposed and concerned to both of these as adding extra burdens on housing providers.",25,,
87,0.97,911.377,916.548,It is affecting our Affordability to be able to continue to provide housing here.,25,,
88,0.97,916.548,923.889,I want to say that you have lost housing units.,25,,
89,0.97,923.889,930.629,Your records show that you are going in the wrong direction with this and will be going further.,25,,
90,0.97,930.629,940.005,"If you want to destroy private rental housing in Seattle, continue to do what you are doing because you are doing a great job of it.",25,,
91,0.97,940.005,948.047,You will regret it and you're not helping the people --,25,,
92,0.97,948.047,958.19,"Kay and then Angie, then Jennifer if she is available.",26,,
93,0.97,958.19,963.762,"Go ahead, Kate.",26,,
94,0.97,963.762,964.396,"Kate, you are still muted.",27,,
95,0.97,964.396,966.532,There you go.,27,,
96,0.97,966.532,970.202,Can you hear me?,28,,
97,0.97,970.202,970.803,Yes.,29,,
98,0.97,970.803,971.87,Thank you.,30,,
99,0.97,971.87,980.179,"My name is Kay, and I have been a small landlord for 15 years and city Council, thank you for hearing my comment.",30,,
100,0.97,980.179,1005.738,Speaking out against the bills relating to just cause of action and Eviction defenses and amending 22.205.090 of the Seattle municipal code.,30,,
101,0.97,1005.738,1011.643,The city was once found negligent of providing due process to landlords because it did not allow them to test the veracity of a tenant and their celebration of hardship.,30,,
102,0.97,1011.643,1020.619,The city appealed the decision and is now challenging the decision by Fax checking this legislation through a vote.,30,,
103,0.97,1020.619,1037.836,"I acknowledge that the Eviction process is hard on both tenants and landlords and this is the key, acknowledging both parties, both parties have responsibilities to maintain housing and the landlord must provide a safe unit that is in good working order and the tenant --",30,,
104,0.97,1037.836,1048.18,"Angie, go ahead.",31,,
105,0.97,1049.081,1050.816,My husband and I are small landlords in Ballard.,32,,
106,0.97,1050.816,1062.461,"I am calling to ask that city council vote no on both items today, Seattle is experiencing a great loss of small rental properties.",32,,
107,0.97,1062.461,1067.733,Which is directly related to the synonymy of legislation that Council has turned out in the last five years.,32,,
108,0.97,1067.733,1077.876,"Without any collaboration or input from small rental property owners to provide a large proportion of affordable rental housing in Seattle, especially a family sized house.",32,,
109,0.97,1077.876,1082.915,Council funded a small landlord Stakeholder group which they have not been able to implement yet.,32,,
110,0.97,1082.915,1091.89,Council also funded a new rental housing study which has not begun to happen.,32,,
111,0.97,1091.89,1098.797,"You developing policies and an echo Chamber, include Stakeholders before developing a new rental regulation.",32,,
112,0.97,1098.797,1099.398,Thank you.,32,,
113,0.97,1099.398,1104.236,Two more speakers who are showing as present and have not spoken.,33,,
114,0.97,1104.236,1108.173,"Let's see if they can speak, Jennifer and Daniel.",33,,
115,0.97,1108.173,1118.517,"Go ahead, Jennifer.",33,,
116,0.97,1119.151,1124.156,Jennifer is still muted.,34,,
117,0.97,1124.156,1134.333,"It just prompted me to Unmute, this is Daniel.",34,,
118,0.97,1134.333,1150.582,"I am calling on behalf of the rental housing Association of Washington represents over 5000 small housing provider across the state, many in Seattle and I want you to know on both bills.",34,,
119,0.97,1150.582,1174.473,"The first puts an unnecessary burden on every housing provider in the city to provide private information to the city, mandatory participation has already been shown to result in inaccurate and unreliable data, mandating housing providers to provide a private information to a third party with certification and management procedures only adding unnecessary cost to housing providers while the city claims to care about affordable housing.",34,,
120,0.97,1174.473,1186.952,"The city should focus on Partnering with the industry and funding research projects rather than passing impossible to enforce mandates that will, according to research, produce meaningless data.",34,,
121,0.97,1186.952,1192.291,Please stop passing legislation that Harms housing providers when we have the desire to work together to solve our issues.,34,,
122,0.97,1192.291,1195.861,Moving on to the second --,34,,
123,0.97,1195.861,1197.696,Last try for Jennifer.,35,,
124,0.97,1197.696,1211.543,Are you able to Unmute by pressing Star 6?,35,,
125,0.97,1213.211,1218.016,She is still muted.,36,,
126,0.97,1218.016,1223.488,"Okay, unfortunately it is not working so all of the other speakers have spoken.",37,,
127,0.97,1223.488,1231.964,Anthony Jacob is still showing not present and I will close public comment and begin our agenda items.,37,,
128,0.97,1231.964,1245.744,"Our first agenda item is the bill from Council member Pedersen to include information about rent, information landlords need to report under the rendered rental registration inspection ordinance.",37,,
129,0.97,1245.744,1276.041,"I will read the title and turn it over to Councilmember Pedersen . We are joined by Asha Venkataraman from Council center staff . The bill relating to housing and displacement litigation, expanding the information required for submission under the rental registration inspection ordinance for Mac rental housing units requiring submission of rental housing related information and amending chapter--Councilmember Pedersen, welcome.",37,,
130,0.97,1276.041,1284.416,Thank you for having me as a guest to discuss this bill.,38,,
131,0.97,1284.416,1297.829,"I was back at your Committee in March discussing a substantially similar bill, central staff will discuss, today, a couple of changes that have been made since then.",38,,
132,0.97,1297.829,1305.237,Hopefully this has given people a lot of time to think about this bill and the need for additional information.,38,,
133,0.97,1305.237,1318.216,I believe it would efficiently fill the Long-Standing gap in data for the Seattle rental housing inventory so that we finally get the detailed information we need for Well- informed policymaking about affordable housing.,38,,
134,0.97,1318.216,1344.776,"The rental housing registration in Seattle and inspection ordinance adopted several years ago already requires landlords to submit a list of the rental units and this bill would simply have property owners include that list, along with rental rates, square footage, vacancy information, to a research University to compile and analyze this important data, no personal information would be provided.",38,,
135,0.97,1344.776,1376.241,"Over the past several years, city government has lacked a level of detail needed to understand much information about the Seattle housing inventory, including Non- subsidized housing that happens to have below market rents were more affordable rent, we do not know exactly where the housing is and we need to know that as we make decisions such as updating our comprehensive plan which we will be doing very shortly.",38,,
136,0.97,1376.241,1386.017,We have tried to get this information in other ways as we have a statement of legislative intent in November of 2020 and got a response from the executive which was--which indicated that there is still a gap in the data.,38,,
137,0.97,1386.017,1388.453,We propose this as a solution.,38,,
138,0.97,1388.453,1400.632,I know that small landlords are upset about this because they have been subjected to a lot of regulatory changes over the past few years but I believe they have a compelling need for this data.,38,,
139,0.97,1400.632,1409.541,So we know and understand our cities housing inventory as we approach these big decisions such as the comprehensive plan.,38,,
140,0.97,1409.541,1418.083,"We want to do more to prevent displacement, economic displacement of existing residents and we need to understand where this below market housing exists.",38,,
141,0.97,1418.083,1430.061,"I think that central staff has done a great job working with my team, I want to thank Councilmember Sawant and her committee clerk for accommodating us today.",38,,
142,0.97,1430.061,1438.17,But maybe turning it over to central staff to talk through the details of the bill would be helpful.,38,,
143,0.97,1438.17,1444.476,"Good morning, Council members.",39,,
144,0.97,1444.476,1455.453,"I am with Council central staff, Asha Venkataraman, thank you Councilmember Pedersen, we are talking about bill 120325.",39,,
145,0.97,1455.453,1470.302,"I will just go through a short description of the differences in the bills and talk through the issues for the Council members to consider, and then talk about potential amendments and next steps.",39,,
146,0.97,1470.302,1501.633,"Council bill 120284, conceptually, the intent of that bill and 120325, they would require landlords to submit an rental housing information to a research University to certify to the Seattle Department of construction and inspections that it has done so through a certification, through the rental registration and inspection ordinance existing process.",39,,
147,0.97,1501.633,1526.191,"It contemplates that an executive Department, either the office of planning and community development or the office of housing, as the most likely candidates, would contract the research University to have this information analyzed and get analysis back to the city about displacement risks and the rental market.",39,,
148,0.97,1526.191,1535.467,"Between the time we discussed these bills, a couple of changes to be built were incorporated.",39,,
149,0.97,1535.467,1545.043,"Some of which required a change, which is why there is a new Council built in front of you.",39,,
150,0.97,1545.043,1583.415,"There are a couple of changes, one is the date for submission of this information by landlords, was originally slated for information about rental information about February was due on March 31st, and instead the due date sifted to rental information about the month of March being pushed out to--excuse me, for submission through April 14th, and originally information about rent and rental housing units was due by August.",39,,
151,0.97,1583.415,1591.69,That shifted to information about September is now due October 15th.,39,,
152,0.97,1591.69,1601.766,"Additionally, we have added the name of the property owner and the address of the property to the list of information to be submitted, that was inadvertently left off of the original draft.",39,,
153,0.97,1601.766,1615.58,And it added the need for analysis of the rental market housing additions to the analysis of displacement risks to make sure both issues were covered.,39,,
154,0.97,1615.58,1635.033,"In addition, the bill adds a sunset provision that requires the information to be submitted up until the next time the comprehensive plan is updated and adopted, or at the end of 2025, whichever one is later.",39,,
155,0.97,1635.033,1639.504,Those are the majority of the changes in this new bill.,39,,
156,0.97,1639.504,1656.755,I will go through and talk about some of the issues that we did discuss during the last committee meeting but continue to apply to this new Council bill . one of those is that they will require some time to update the I.T.,39,,
157,0.97,1656.755,1662.027,System to track compliance effectively.,39,,
158,0.97,1662.027,1677.675,"In addition, whatever Department decides to contract with the research University will require some time to negotiate project scope, select the research University through a German process, and finalize it so the property owners know to whom they are submitting the information requested.",39,,
159,0.97,1677.675,1687.619,One of the issues we discussed at the last committee meeting also concerned the funding that would be needed to support this program.,39,,
160,0.97,1687.619,1696.761,"So both funding for the contract itself, as well as additional staff for them to monitor compliance.",39,,
161,0.97,1696.761,1715.88,"In conversations with the executive, it does not appear that there are existing funds they would be used to absorb the costs and the Council may want to consider either adding funds in a supplemental budget and during the 2023 budget process this fall.",39,,
162,0.97,1715.88,1730.962,"That could be complicated just because of the general funds expenditures out of funding the revenues, or projected general fund revenues because the departments are being asked to identify reductions.",39,,
163,0.97,1730.962,1736.968,The Council may want to consider how that may impact when this program is going to affect.,39,,
164,0.97,1736.968,1742.507,"Additionally, those are the issues that we spoke through at the last committee meeting.",39,,
165,0.97,1742.507,1747.979,"With this new bill, there are other issues I wanted to flag for the committee.",39,,
166,0.97,1747.979,1752.25,One of those issues is about timing.,39,,
167,0.97,1752.25,1782.881,"Right now, the bill is slated to go into effect 30 days after signature by the Mayor, the regular timing for any Council bill . The challenge is that a research University would need to have the infrastructure in place to collect the information, or, if it does not have the infrastructure in place, have another way for property owners to submit this information to them at the time the bill is effective and the first due date goes into place.",39,,
168,0.97,1782.881,1804.636,"The complication is that, without knowing who the contract will be awarded to, it is not clear at this time whether the University would be able to submit that--excuse me, to that received that information right away and committee members may want to consider whether to push the effectiveness of some provisions until after a contract is executed.",39,,
169,0.97,1804.636,1820.718,One minor issue in the list of information that is to be submitted is that it requires information sufficient to ascertain the current housing costs.,39,,
170,0.97,1820.718,1838.97,"Given that that formulation is just a little bit vague, it may be more useful and straightforward to property owners to know what they need to submit by saying that they need to submit just the current housing costs, rather than information sufficient to ascertain it.",39,,
171,0.97,1838.97,1847.478,The sunset provisions currently in the legislation apply to the major new sections that require submission of the information to the University.,39,,
172,0.97,1847.478,1876.975,"Got sunset provision only applies to that new section and Councilmembers may want to consider adding the sunset provision to the other changes in the bill that require certification submission to Suci on a particular schedule so that these provisions expire at the same time, and there are not inadvertently code sections left referring to requirements that no longer exist.",39,,
173,0.97,1876.975,1885.283,Attached to my memo is also additional feedback for the consideration of the committee that came from the executive.,39,,
174,0.97,1885.283,1907.905,"I will not go through those in detail but some of the issues that I argued describe--including the pieces about the need to update infrastructure regarding I.T., and the funding issue I previously identified.",39,,
175,0.97,1907.905,1915.747,I will pause before I move into potential amendments to see if there are any questions about what I have raised thus far.,39,,
176,0.97,1915.747,1920.218,Councilmember Nelson?,40,,
177,0.97,1920.218,1926.157,"You are still on mute, Councilmember.",41,,
178,0.97,1926.157,1930.561,What do you mean by housing cost?,42,,
179,0.97,1930.561,1942.974,"Is that the rent being charged for the cost of the landlord to provide it, which would include the mortgage, or whatever?",42,,
180,0.97,1942.974,1954.952,"Yes, it is basically the rent being charged, the term housing caused is defined in the code and it reflects the state definition of housing caused, the intent is to be more or less globally charged.",43,,
181,0.97,1954.952,1961.659,Thank you.,44,,
182,0.97,1961.659,1965.897,I do not see anyone else with questions.,45,,
183,0.97,1965.897,1966.197,Okay.,46,,
184,0.97,1966.197,1971.469,In that case I will move into potential amendments.,46,,
185,0.97,1971.469,1985.016,Councilmember Pedersen has authored and Councilmember Morales has drafted an amendment that would adjust the enforcement provision in the bill for these new requirements.,46,,
186,0.97,1985.016,2002.8,"Currently, any violations of Rio are subject to--any violations or failure to comply are subject to civil penalties of $150 per day for the first 10 days of the violation and $500 per day for each day thereafter.",46,,
187,0.97,2002.8,2014.312,The proposed amendment would exempt violations of these new provisions from that and instead subject them to lower levels of violations.,46,,
188,0.97,2014.312,2025.223,We are looking at $500 for the first violation and up to $1000 for each subsequent violation within a three-year period.,46,,
189,0.97,2025.223,2041.105,These penalties were modeled after the rental agreement regulations that are in Chapter 7.24 that seemed more appropriate for violations of reporting.,46,,
190,0.97,2041.105,2071.536,"The Rio scheme, my understanding is that it is intended to deal with housing code violations, things that are continuing for a long time when it comes to people housing quality and making that change would put these reporting requirements in line with the rental agreement requirements in Chapter 7. that is the only proposed amendment at this time.",46,,
191,0.97,2071.536,2077.041,I will turn it back over to Councilmember Pedersen.,46,,
192,0.97,2077.041,2083.915,"Thank you, that was excellent, as always, Asha.",47,,
193,0.97,2083.915,2098.196,"Councilmember Sawant, I am happy to answer questions from colleagues, as is Asha, and I appreciate Councilmember Morales putting the amendment forward because I am not on the committee.",47,,
194,0.97,2098.196,2109.74,"Thank you, Asha, thank you Councilmember Pedersen . do any Councilmembers have further questions or comments in general or about the amendment?",48,,
195,0.97,2109.74,2111.142,The bill has not been moved yet.,48,,
196,0.97,2111.142,2117.448,I will do that if Councilmembers are prepared to vote.,48,,
197,0.97,2117.448,2122.72,I wanted to open it up for further discussion first.,48,,
198,0.97,2122.72,2123.921,Chair?,49,,
199,0.97,2123.921,2126.39,Go ahead.,50,,
200,0.97,2126.39,2136.734,"I realize the amendment has not been moved but I wanted to speak to why I am agreeing to cosponsor this, if this is the right time?",51,,
201,0.97,2136.734,2140.004,Yes.,52,,
202,0.97,2140.004,2141.839,Thank you.,53,,
203,0.97,2141.839,2147.712,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen, for asking me to partner with you on this.",53,,
204,0.97,2147.712,2154.652,I have agreed to sponsor this because we do not have a real method for data collection.,53,,
205,0.97,2154.652,2160.091,No real way to determine the rate at which meant is increasing in the city.,53,,
206,0.97,2160.091,2166.33,"It is increasing and, in the last six months, rent has skyrocketed.",53,,
207,0.97,2166.33,2170.201,We do not have an accurate way to collect the data.,53,,
208,0.97,2170.201,2173.237,That puts us at an extreme disadvantage.,53,,
209,0.97,2173.237,2192.79,"My hope is that, with this data collection provided to the city, as policymakers, it will allow us to get a better sense of how massive the need is for more homes that are more affordable to people of all incomes in the city.",53,,
210,0.97,2192.79,2201.032,This would really illustrate the need for policies and programs that would help keep currently affordable rent affordable.,53,,
211,0.97,2201.032,2233.831,But can also help center the need for more publicly owned homes and more production that we are trying to get out the door so that our neighbors do not get pushed out--it is a simple tool in making decisions about policies and our counterparts in the executive branch and it would help Renters stay in Seattle.,53,,
212,0.97,2233.831,2246.611,Thank you for the opportunity and I am probably going to have to switch to my phone but I look forward to working with you all.,53,,
213,0.97,2246.611,2252.45,"Again, I will invite any Councilmembers to speak.",54,,
214,0.97,2252.45,2265.329,"To clarify, whether you want to speak to the bill as a whole or the amendment being discussed, that is fine, just let me know.",54,,
215,0.97,2265.329,2267.898,"Go ahead, Councilmember Nelson.",54,,
216,0.97,2267.898,2294.158,"I share Councilmember Pedersen's desire for more information about the housing information provided by small housing providers, and I am concerned because the 2020--the annual report did say that ours stock was down about 14% from the previous year.",55,,
217,0.97,2294.158,2308.239,I want to know--that is important for us to know as we go forward with decisions around landlord and tenant issues.,55,,
218,0.97,2308.239,2317.715,"Also, if we want to figure out what is really happening with the appearance of those units, or those properties from the list.",55,,
219,0.97,2317.715,2340.271,"I am concerned that this legislation places an additional burden on small landlords because the stated Úpurpose, or the goal, from th sponsor, Councilmember Pedersen, is to help us make Land-Use decisions during the amendment process in 2024.",55,,
220,0.97,2340.271,2351.849,"And so I think that, Burdening small landlords in order to get to the goal, is unnecessary.",55,,
221,0.97,2351.849,2391.655,"In Cape--case people were not following the previous Iterations, people should know that this Council bill would require landlords to produce information about the net Rentable square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, information to ascertain the total net monthly residential rent charged, including but not limited to total monthly residential rent being charged or to be charged if vacant, as well as the amount and identity of utilities paid by the owner, including the rent charge and is subject to a rental agreement, the current length of the term of the rental agreement.",55,,
222,0.97,2391.655,2406.704,"Well, there is a background memo basically saying that landlords typically produce roles on a monthly basis for their own internal bookkeeping to monitor and fill vacancies and determine rental revenue.",55,,
223,0.97,2406.704,2408.239,For management and tax purposes.,55,,
224,0.97,2408.239,2413.21,But most small landlords actually do not do this.,55,,
225,0.97,2413.21,2422.82,They do not have to put down that much information and usually they recorded the revenue on their tax forms once per year.,55,,
226,0.97,2422.82,2428.225,I do believe that this would be a big job to do twice a year.,55,,
227,0.97,2428.225,2434.331,It is the wrong tool for the information we are trying to get.,55,,
228,0.97,2434.331,2453.017,"So, we are trying to use this information to further the goal of Anti-Displacement, although I just heard Councilmember Morales say this information could be used to monitor rent increases, that is a different purpose, that is a different use of the data.",55,,
229,0.97,2453.017,2456.053,But we don't do that.,55,,
230,0.97,2456.053,2463.16,We don't ask other small business owners for this kind of detailed information.,55,,
231,0.97,2463.16,2473.938,"For example, we do not ask all produce vendors to submit the kinds of vegetables they sell and the prices they charge to identify food deserts across our city and prevent the spread.",55,,
232,0.97,2473.938,2493.624,"The information we are asking for is proprietary, and, although it is an anonymous analysis, we are asking for the names, those names are of the property owners and that is this Closable.",55,,
233,0.97,2493.624,2522.486,"Anyway, I think that, for these reasons, per the amendment, I would support this amendment if the legislation would go forward because it is a little bit better than what was think those assets are too much for landlords struggling to deal with the impacts of the pandemic on their businesses.",55,,
234,0.97,2522.486,2530.194,"In any case, those are my reasons for not favoring this bill.",55,,
235,0.97,2530.194,2531.195,Thank you.,55,,
236,0.97,2531.195,2556.587,"Did any other Councilmembers, committee members, want to--I do have some points but I will wait to see if the Councilmember Lewis or Council President Juarez want to speak . Councilmember Pedersen, do you want to respond to anything that has come up?",56,,
237,0.97,2556.587,2560.291,"Thank you, chair Sawant . I appreciate the critique.",57,,
238,0.97,2560.291,2574.505,I do not know if the grocery store analysis works because the current prices of those products are publicly available or as we do not know what the current contract rents are in apartment projects.,57,,
239,0.97,2574.505,2580.344,That is my only comment.,57,,
240,0.97,2580.344,2580.778,Thank you.,57,,
241,0.97,2580.778,2586.45,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen . that is what I was thinking.",58,,
242,0.97,2586.45,2602.9,"Comparing housing, which is the biggest ticket item in terms of what people how to spend on, given limited income, comparing it to vegetables is ridiculous but does not work because the prices of vegetables are Pblicly known.",58,,
243,0.97,2602.9,2610.074,The problem is the pricing in housing is not known.,58,,
244,0.97,2610.074,2620.217,"I just wanted to say, overall, I support this bill, it would be good to have more data about the rent that landlords charge.",58,,
245,0.97,2620.217,2643.54,"It is ironic that, in public comment, the supposedly small landlords simultaneously claim a charge low rent an object to disclosing the rent they charge, which makes no sense, if you are charging low rent, why would you object to having to disclose that?",58,,
246,0.97,2643.54,2652.516,This claim seems to be from landlords that they provide Low- rent housing and that is why they refuse to disclose the rent that we should trust them because it is low.,58,,
247,0.97,2652.516,2655.919,That is not acceptable.,58,,
248,0.97,2655.919,2660.591,Landlords and Councilmember Nelson call this a burden.,58,,
249,0.97,2660.591,2662.059,This happened last time we discussed this bill.,58,,
250,0.97,2662.059,2669.133,I don't understand how it is a burden to disclose the amount of rent charged.,58,,
251,0.97,2669.133,2674.838,That is the most basic form of information that landlords should be required to share.,58,,
252,0.97,2674.838,2679.81,It is strange when we found out that is not already a requirement.,58,,
253,0.97,2679.81,2689.853,"If you are a small landlords who supposedly owns one or two rental properties, it should be easier, just reporting a couple of numbers.",58,,
254,0.97,2689.853,2693.457,It is not a good argument that somehow that is a burden.,58,,
255,0.97,2693.457,2695.325,How can that be a burden?,58,,
256,0.97,2695.325,2701.031,There should be some other reason why you should oppose this.,58,,
257,0.97,2701.031,2727.658,"Also, I want to say, week after week, we hear completely unfounded claims from landlords who say they are charging low rent but they are leaving the market, they will sell the property, we hear this in every public comment because they say--they claim onerous burden, regulatory burdens from the city and that is why they are leaving the market.",58,,
258,0.97,2727.658,2731.962,That is just not supported by the data.,58,,
259,0.97,2731.962,2755.919,"It is completely speculative, this claim that Renters rights are more--or more increased, protection for Renters is driving small landlords out of the market, that is speculation, property values are skyrocketing, that has something which has been Well- documented.",58,,
260,0.97,2755.919,2766.029,"If the landlords are selling, are they selling because they don't want to comply with basic laws of war because property values have gone through the roof and they can cash in on their property like never before?",58,,
261,0.97,2766.029,2776.006,It is a specious claim to say that regulatory burden is making that or reporting requirements is making you do that.,58,,
262,0.97,2776.006,2800.764,"Make sure to mention that corporate entities are divided up into small Llcs and each claims to be representing a small landlord interest, that is a factor when people are speaking, are they actual small landlord speaking?",58,,
263,0.97,2800.764,2809.473,We have seen people from corporations speak as representatives of small landlords.,58,,
264,0.97,2809.473,2811.942,I think those points have to be noted.,58,,
265,0.97,2811.942,2818.649,"Councilmember Nelson, your zoom hand is up.",58,,
266,0.97,2818.649,2820.851,Go ahead.,58,,
267,0.97,2820.851,2829.626,"I get that my visible analogy may not have been apt, but the rents being charged are also available when you are looking for units.",59,,
268,0.97,2829.626,2848.879,"The point is, this--the purpose of this is to prevent displacement, when we go to Land-Use decisions, and increasing heights in certain areas, that is the reason--that is the stated reason for this piece of legislation.",59,,
269,0.97,2848.879,2850.914,I think there is a better way of getting around that.,59,,
270,0.97,2850.914,2866.23,"We could simply ask somebody to perform the kind of analysis that the company was doing, generate a scope of work for that contract, and have that information to inform our Land- use decisions.",59,,
271,0.97,2866.23,2878.008,"Instead, what I'm hearing, it is clear, this information is going to be used like other political purposes such as rent control.",59,,
272,0.97,2878.008,2898.262,"Let's just be frank about the fact that this information is going to be, I think burdens and to collect, we are not just talking about what are you charging for the units, it is the list of other things mentioned.",59,,
273,0.97,2898.262,2900.297,Thank you.,59,,
274,0.97,2900.297,2916.513,"I will just go ahead--go ahead to Council President Juarez, Councilmember Pedersen, I will give you the last word because it is your bill . I will make a comment and move the bill.",60,,
275,0.97,2916.513,2927.891,"If Councilmembers, if you are ready to vote, I will move it, but if, Councilmember Pedersen, you prefer to hold it, just let me know.",60,,
276,0.97,2927.891,2930.694,"Go ahead, Councilmember Juarez.",60,,
277,0.97,2930.694,2935.232,"Sorry about not using the hand, I could not find it.",61,,
278,0.97,2935.232,2938.869,I will not be supporting this it is format and I will tell you why.,61,,
279,0.97,2938.869,2952.516,"I am split down the middle but one of the things I took refuge and making sure I understood was the information we got from the University of Washington from James young, the director of the Washington center for real estate research.",61,,
280,0.97,2952.516,2961.625,"For me, besides the great work by Asha and they carried a lot of weight, you definitely need this program but I do not think you should mandate participation.",61,,
281,0.97,2961.625,2965.062,That is the concern I have.,61,,
282,0.97,2965.062,2967.364,I will come to the defense of Councilmember Nelson.,61,,
283,0.97,2967.364,2973.07,I think that you have regulatory burdens and you have regulatory burdens.,61,,
284,0.97,2973.07,2979.343,It has to be a direct--it has to have a direct nexus to the intent.,61,,
285,0.97,2979.343,2997.427,"Right now, the regulatory burden, when I looked up the definition of housing costs under 22.204.090, that is a lot of information to be writing two times per year that you require because the marketplace changes.",61,,
286,0.97,2997.427,3018.415,"In this current form, I like the recommendations that the Washington center for the real estate research put forward, also, a lot of information is proprietary because, whether we like it or not, we are in a capitalist society, which is competitive in the marketplace and I can understand why landlords do not want to share that.",61,,
287,0.97,3018.415,3019.116,I get that.,61,,
288,0.97,3019.116,3057.554,"Everything else that I see in the bill by Council Pedersen about the information--let me find a real quick, and I Councilmember Nelson talked about, the list under the 22.214.040, the list of all rental housing units, whether it is vacant or occupied, the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, a lot of the information, I don't find that intrusive, but I would definitely support what the center put forward and maybe workshop this more I am not prepared today to vote yes on this.",61,,
289,0.97,3057.554,3063.627,"I would hate for this to go forward, just go down on a no vote or people abstain.",61,,
290,0.97,3063.627,3075.172,"This is a little side NOTE in regards to everything, it is not helpful when I get seven Emails before 9:00 to try to figure out how we will vote on these two items.",61,,
291,0.97,3075.172,3086.983,"It is not the fault of everyone but that is not helpful, trying to get through all of the new amendments, I counted them up, six amendments before 9:00 today and still trying to work out the other amendments.",61,,
292,0.97,3086.983,3095.892,"I cannot support, in its current form, what I am looking at regarding the proposed Council bill 120325.",61,,
293,0.97,3095.892,3100.764,Thank you.,61,,
294,0.97,3100.764,3107.671,"Smacked thank you, Council President Juarez for weighing in.",61,,
295,0.97,3107.671,3119.683,"On the question of electing a landlord of a corporation collect the data into the city, I completely disagree.",61,,
296,0.97,3119.683,3148.945,"That amounts to letting the landlord choose what data we ca the data collected by a public entity--the data would be objectively collected because it would be collected not from the corporation, but a lot of the data exist in the public realm.",61,,
297,0.97,3148.945,3174.905,"The way Councilmember Nelson is talking about it, she is making it sound like it is unusual but it is not unusual to have data in the public realm and corporations use the data, working people also use the data, that--the data collectors do not make the decisions, the data collection process will be objective, so I am not exactly clear what the concern is, there was nothing unusual about that.",61,,
298,0.97,3174.905,3190.954,"I am prepared to vote today but Council President Juarez says she would prefer to vote, imply that, and if it were moved today, she would vote no.",61,,
299,0.97,3190.954,3204.768,"It is not time sensitive legislation, so Councilmember Pedersen, I will let you speak on this . smacked thank you, chair Sawant.",61,,
300,0.97,3204.768,3215.345,"This bill has been with the committee for the last two months and the two changes that have been made have reduced its scope, we put a sunset clause in and we reduced the enforcement.",61,,
301,0.97,3215.345,3218.982,That is what is before you.,61,,
302,0.97,3218.982,3233.196,"Councilmember Morales has a scheduling conflict, so, to the extent she is here to move my amendment to reduce the enforcement, I am fine having a vote today.",61,,

304,0.97,3237.867,3249.446,"I will go ahead, because Councilmember Pedersen is not a member of this Committee, I will move Council bill 120325 on his behalf do I have a second?",62,,
305,0.97,3249.446,3249.746,Second.,63,,

336,0.97,3365.228,3372.969,That passes as amended.,89,,
337,0.97,3372.969,3374.371,Great.,90,,
338,0.97,3374.371,3379.242,It does to the city council on?,90,,
339,0.97,3379.242,3383.113,May 31st.,91,,
340,0.97,3383.113,3422.952,"Okay, thank you, Ted, and thank you, Councilmembers for that discussion, Councilmember Pedersen, thank you for being here, thank you, Councilmember Morales . Thank you, Asha, as well . Now the amendment of the six month Eviction defensive response decision by the court of Appeals as I read the bill into the record now--Council bill relating to just cause Evictions, changing the terms of Eviction defenses and amending sections for 22.205.090 and 22.205.100 of the Seattle municipal code.",92,,
341,0.97,3422.952,3429.225,Asha Venkataraman is still here from city council staff and will present the legislation.,92,,
342,0.97,3429.225,3430.026,"Go ahead, Asha.",92,,
343,0.97,3430.026,3447.977,"Thank you . Council central staff, Asha Venkataraman, the bill, it AMENDS Seattle municipal code sections 22.205.090 and 22.205.100.",93,,
344,0.97,3447.977,3462.325,"22.205.090 is the defense put into place several years ago that would allow a tenant to assert the defense, during the Eviction moratorium and six months after the Eviction moratorium expires.",93,,
345,0.97,3462.325,3472.302,"That is because the moratorium--the city moratorium expired at the end of February, the defense would be in effect through the end of August.",93,,
346,0.97,3472.302,3491.888,"As has been discussed, excuse me, this defense was challenged and was in litigation, the court of Appeals issued its decision on the procedural due process part of this legislation.",93,,
347,0.97,3491.888,3507.003,And ruled that it needed to be more clear that a landlord has the opportunity to rebut the assertion of financial hardship that a tenant was self certifying at the time.,93,,
348,0.97,3507.003,3518.581,"In response, this piece of legislation removed the requirement of proof of financial hardship from both 22.205.090 and 22.205.100.",93,,
349,0.97,3518.581,3535.031,"So, rather than, as Councilmember Sawant discussed in the committee meeting, rather than add the ability for a landlord to rebut the assertion of financial hardship, it removes the requirement to prove financial hardship altogether.",93,,
350,0.97,3535.031,3543.907,That is the crux of the changes that this bill would make.,93,,
351,0.97,3543.907,3567.363,"Because of the--let me back up, at the moment, the housing justice project provide advocacy for tenants in court against Eviction, that has been using the rental assistance that is under contract through the county that is available to use for tenants.",93,,
352,0.97,3567.363,3573.436,That contract is set to end June 30th and not clear if there will be an extension or if there are any actual rental assistance left.,93,,
353,0.97,3573.436,3583.713,The housing justice project does not administer the rental assistance funds for the city but it can advocate for tenants in general.,93,,
354,0.97,3583.713,3605.935,"Because of the expiration of the contract on June 30th, the ability of the attorneys to use rental assistance in trying to decrease the likelihood of Eviction for tenants stops, leaving this defense in effect for July and August.",93,,
355,0.97,3605.935,3628.124,"Because of the practicality of using the defense without making this change that is contemplated, either in this bill, or the amendment to this bill, the Eviction defense attorneys are less likely to be able to assert the defense, which is the reason for this bill moving forward.",93,,
356,0.97,3628.124,3654.55,"If it passes out of committee today, the suspension of the rules, it can go in front of the full Council for consideration this coming Tuesday, which will allow the Mayor the efficient amount of time to sign if he chooses to be in effect by",93,,
357,0.97,3654.784,3655.251,Thank you.,94,,
358,0.97,3655.251,3657.153,I have nothing to add at this moment.,94,,
359,0.97,3657.153,3661.29,I already made my comment and I do not want to repeat them.,94,,
360,0.97,3661.29,3667.897,I will see what comes up you.,94,,
361,0.97,3667.897,3668.164,Go ahead.,94,,
362,0.97,3668.164,3674.871,I have a procedural question.,95,,
363,0.97,3674.871,3681.444,We filed a motion to reconsider on April 8th.,95,,
364,0.97,3681.444,3684.213,Is that the last stop on the litigation train?,95,,
365,0.97,3684.213,3688.317,To be considered in the court of Appeals.,95,,
366,0.97,3688.317,3692.789,As far as I know that is the last thing that has happened.,96,,
367,0.97,3692.789,3695.024,So that has been pending since April 8th.,97,,
368,0.97,3695.024,3701.764,Thank you.,97,,
369,0.97,3701.764,3704.133,Any other committee members?,98,,
370,0.97,3704.133,3709.138,Councilmember Nelson?,98,,
371,0.97,3709.138,3719.082,I believe the Council was unnecessarily rushed to consider this legislation.,99,,
372,0.97,3719.082,3724.187,"To do so makes no sense before our executive session on Monday, which I understand some Councilmembers are waiting for before they put forward amendments.",99,,
373,0.97,3724.187,3737.433,I say unnecessarily because it's supposedly being driven by the termination of the contract.,99,,
374,0.97,3737.7,3740.303,That contract will end anyway because that's when the assistance funding will end.,99,,
375,0.97,3740.303,3743.372,"The end of that contract is, to me, immaterial to this defense.",99,,
376,0.97,3743.372,3749.178,Moreover SDC I also has an ongoing contract I believe.,99,,
377,0.97,3749.178,3757.62,Advocates for themselves can still use this defense regardless of the June 30th contract expiration.,99,,
378,0.97,3757.62,3767.897,This defense is still on the books during the city's appeal of the ruling in Rha's favor.,99,,
379,0.97,3767.897,3778.741,Which found the defense unconstitutional for allowing landlords to challenge the tenants self inability to pay rent.,99,,
380,0.97,3778.741,3779.976,That's why I walked this on.,99,,
381,0.97,3779.976,3787.316,I understood that the June 30th date was irrelevant to the continued use of this defense while our motion for reconsidering is still pending.,99,,
382,0.97,3787.316,3810.806,It is my understanding that taking legislative action to amend the six month defense to fix the deficit identified by the court of Appeals would likely be moved in efforts by the court of Appeals in hopes of it gaining a more favorable statement of due process of law.,99,,
383,0.97,3810.806,3821.25,The stakes are pretty high here because the courts decision on that claim could impact future legislative act efforts in this realm.,99,,
384,0.97,3821.25,3831.194,I believe it could impact our current motion of reconsideration in a negative way.,99,,
385,0.97,3831.194,3838.634,"Nevertheless we were presented with two options for fixing the six month defense, should we decide to go that route anyway.",99,,
386,0.97,3838.634,3851.914,"We were strongly advised in favor of the option that retains the requirement for tenants self certification of financial hardship, but makes clear the landlord has an opportunity to rebut the showing.",99,,
387,0.97,3851.914,3863.893,It resolves the defect identified by the court of Appeals without inviting the argument that not requiring the tenant to demonstrate hardship is a defect.,99,,
388,0.97,3863.893,3886.849,"Removing the requirement for showing of hardship, which this legislation does, increases a legal risk that the six month defense will be successfully challenged . why not extend protections to all tenants regardless of the ability to pay?",99,,
389,0.97,3886.849,3896.626,It basically God's the rationale of the six month defense.,99,,
390,0.97,3896.626,3901.664,There is already a paper trail showing why we put the hardship requirement in there anyway.,99,,
391,0.97,3901.664,3904.533,Because of contract laws.,99,,
392,0.97,3904.533,3922.285,Instead of protecting ourselves against claims for a landlords due process we are taking a far riskier path of exposing the city to potential contract clause violation suits.,99,,
393,0.97,3922.285,3928.724,I don't see why we would do that.,99,,
394,0.97,3928.724,3931.827,Go ahead.,100,,
395,0.97,3931.827,3933.562,Just a couple points of clarity.,101,,
396,0.97,3933.562,3939.802,I won't speak to the legal risk piece.,101,,
397,0.97,3939.802,3948.344,"The contract the city has with the housing justice project, as you mentioned, is to provide Eviction defense services.",101,,
398,0.97,3948.344,3952.815,I want to make clear that it is not the same as the contract that we have with the county.,101,,
399,0.97,3952.815,3956.519,That is specifically about distributing rental assistance.,101,,
400,0.97,3956.519,3961.958,This contract does not distribute any rental assistance.,101,,
401,0.97,3961.958,3970.633,The contract ending on June 30th is the end of the rental assistance piece being available.,101,,
402,0.97,3970.633,4003.532,"The only other thing I wanted to clarify is that some of the reason for making these changes is the understanding that we have from the Eviction defense attorneys . without the use of rental assistance the ability to use this defense without making a legislative fix could be compromised, since judges may be likely to look at the court of Appeals decision.",101,,
403,0.97,4003.532,4005.334,Even though it is not final and binding.,101,,
404,0.97,4005.334,4008.771,Judges could make their own decisions about how the existing law violates due process.,101,,
405,0.97,4008.771,4011.474,I just wanted to make that clear.,101,,
406,0.97,4011.474,4015.745,Thank you so much.,102,,
407,0.97,4015.745,4016.746,That was extremely helpful.,102,,
408,0.97,4016.746,4025.621,I was just going to add to what you said.,102,,
409,0.97,4025.621,4030.893,The way Councilmember Nelson was describing it is the exact opposite.,102,,
410,0.97,4030.893,4035.164,Right now Renters are using contracting.,102,,
411,0.97,4035.164,4041.937,This is a secondary line of defense.,102,,
412,0.97,4041.937,4046.709,It constitutes the area this bill is in.,102,,
413,0.97,4046.709,4052.882,That contract ends in June.,102,,
414,0.97,4052.882,4063.659,Starting in July this line of defense becomes more important.,102,,
415,0.97,4063.659,4072.968,It is important that this bill is passed soon.,102,,
416,0.97,4072.968,4082.845,As far as the claim from Councilmember Nelson that somehow the motion for reconsideration will be affected adversely . I understand that you do not speak to this.,102,,
417,0.97,4082.845,4085.915,I have not heard that claim at all.,102,,
418,0.97,4085.915,4087.95,I can't really speak to that.,102,,
419,0.97,4087.95,4112.942,"As far as why this bill removes any requirements for reporting for Renters is because the statistical evidence, overwhelmingly, shows that not only Hard-Working people and the poorest and lowest income people--it doesn't work.",102,,
420,0.97,4112.942,4115.811,It doesn't work in the way it is supposedly intended because it creates complications.,102,,
421,0.97,4115.811,4127.523,In the spirit of position that the office has had all along we are advocating that we remove the testing requirement entirely.,102,,
422,0.97,4127.523,4154.35,"I can tell you, after having succeeded our office and the Renters rights, after winning bill after bill for Renters rights despite the opposition of many Councilmembers, every time a bill has passed we have heard from Councilmembers that it will create legal risk.",102,,
423,0.97,4154.35,4163.826,The overwhelming majority of Renters rights stands.,102,,
424,0.97,4163.826,4171.367,Basically the sky was going to fall down if you passed anything Progressive.,102,,
425,0.97,4171.367,4173.836,That is the general thing that we hear all the time.,102,,
426,0.97,4173.836,4180.809,I think it is important to do it very thoughtfully and carefully and strategically.,102,,
427,0.97,4180.809,4184.747,I believe this bill fulfills all of those requirements.,102,,
428,0.97,4184.747,4191.554,Central staff have had time to really think about this and work on this.,102,,
429,0.97,4191.554,4199.895,I don't see any specific concerns that are justified . of course I understand the political differences.,102,,
430,0.97,4199.895,4205.935,I appreciate everyone speaking about them openly.,102,,
431,0.97,4205.935,4208.437,Are there any other comments in terms of the discussion portion?,102,,
432,0.97,4208.437,4217.279,We will move to the amendment after the bill is moved.,102,,
433,0.97,4217.279,4217.88,Any general comments?,102,,
434,0.97,4217.88,4219.215,I do not see anything.,102,,
435,0.97,4219.215,4225.854,I will go ahead and move counsel bill 120330.,102,,
436,0.97,4225.854,4236.165,We have a second?,102,,
437,0.97,4243.272,4244.84,The bill has been moved and Seconded.,102,,
438,0.97,4244.84,4249.078,I will be supporting this bill with or without the amendment.,102,,
439,0.97,4249.078,4259.255,Preventing any confusion about Renters having access to Eviction defense is the priority.,102,,
440,0.97,4259.255,4279.908,Just based on statistical evidence it is deeply humiliating . I will make this space available for our Councilmembers for moving any amendments.,102,,
441,0.97,4279.908,4284.713,Councilmember Lewis?,102,,
442,0.97,4284.713,4286.115,Not at this time.,103,,
443,0.97,4286.115,4293.956,Okay.,104,,
444,0.97,4293.956,4295.891,I don't think there are any amendments.,104,,
445,0.97,4295.891,4299.495,Councilmember Nelson?,104,,
446,0.97,4299.495,4300.562,Please Unmute yourself.,104,,
447,0.97,4300.562,4303.198,Thank you.,104,,
448,0.97,4303.198,4337.9,"I move the amendment distributed this morning to the Councilmembers and submitted to central staff on Wednesday for preparation for this committee meeting, which essentially retains the requirement for a statement of hardship . It includes language saying, landlords have the ability to provide that showing.",105,,
449,0.97,4337.9,4345.674,Lee's walk us through that.,105,,
450,0.97,4345.674,4346.675,Two we have a second?,105,,
451,0.97,4346.675,4347.276,Second.,106,,
452,0.97,4347.276,4348.143,I shared my screen.,107,,
453,0.97,4348.143,4358.587,Hopefully you can see it.,107,,
454,0.97,4361.423,4372.501,"The way the bill is Crafted it restores much of the text, as you can see in the underlined read.",107,,
455,0.97,4372.501,4384.146,"It restores that text and adds the requirement here, sorry, not the requirement.",107,,
456,0.97,4384.146,4385.314,The presumption.,107,,
457,0.97,4385.314,4390.986,The tenant certification of financial hardship.,107,,
458,0.97,4390.986,4396.658,It explicitly States that the landlord may look at it.,107,,
459,0.97,4396.658,4402.164,That is for section 2205-100.,107,,
460,0.97,4402.164,4411.874,The last piece of that is the notice language to reflect how that bill would have changed the defense.,107,,
461,0.97,4411.874,4423.952,This amendment would just restore that to how it has originally been stated.,107,,
462,0.97,4423.952,4426.789,The bill has been moved and Seconded and explained.,108,,
463,0.97,4426.789,4434.029,Are there any other comments?,108,,
464,0.97,4434.029,4438.033,Councilmember Lewis?,108,,
465,0.97,4438.033,4443.038,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,109,,
466,0.97,4443.038,4461.423,I had originally intended to bring this amendment forward in partnership with Councilmember Mosqueda today.,109,,
467,0.97,4461.423,4475.337,We considered this amendment after having a consecutive meeting on the legislation . I appreciate Councilmember Nelson bringing it forward for discussion today.,109,,
468,0.97,4475.337,4479.975,I think it's good to air these issues and have them discussed.,109,,
469,0.97,4479.975,4496.225,"Given my conversation on the preferred sequencing of Councilmember Mosqueda, who is the author, I will be abstaining on this amendment and likely the underlying legislation today.",109,,
470,0.97,4496.225,4505.834,I do think the public and the committee will benefit from talking about the issues raised.,109,,
471,0.97,4505.834,4516.345,In any event to those are my comments on the amendment.,109,,
472,0.97,4516.345,4517.212,Thank you.,110,,
473,0.97,4517.212,4523.519,"Councilmember Nelson, is that your hand up?",110,,
474,0.97,4523.519,4523.752,Yes.,111,,
475,0.97,4523.752,4525.42,I appreciate the difficulty in the sequencing.,111,,
476,0.97,4525.42,4528.223,That is precisely why I'm concerned that we did rush this on.,111,,
477,0.97,4528.223,4530.058,Let me be clear.,111,,
478,0.97,4530.058,4542.17,Passing this quickly so that it is done by June 30th would be a convenience for the advocates that are using this defense.,111,,
479,0.97,4542.17,4549.878,It's not necessary . But it would be a convenience because it's more clear.,111,,
480,0.97,4549.878,4552.281,I'm talking about protecting our city here.,111,,
481,0.97,4552.281,4554.349,We should not vote on it.,111,,
482,0.97,4554.349,4570.832,"The point is, one more week to simply discuss this in an executive session for what the pros and Cons are is a good idea.",111,,
483,0.97,4570.832,4582.11,I just wanted to be clear that we have to think about -Nevermind.,111,,
484,0.97,4582.11,4583.845,"Anyway, thank you very much.",111,,
485,0.97,4583.845,4588.283,I'm retaining the amendment on the table.,111,,
486,0.97,4588.283,4606.001,"I wanted to clarify, as described, this is not that complicated.",112,,
487,0.97,4606.001,4610.505,I don't see a reason to not vote on this day.,112,,
488,0.97,4610.505,4614.509,It's been moved and Seconded.,112,,
489,0.97,4614.509,4615.577,We will be having a vote.,112,,
490,0.97,4615.577,4619.915,The city council vote will be after the executive sessions.,112,,
491,0.97,4619.915,4627.889,At the city council meeting there is space for amendments and Councilmembers can bring amendments there.,112,,
492,0.97,4627.889,4630.392,That discussion can happen.,112,,
493,0.97,4630.392,4637.232,There was nothing that was stopping that discussion from happening.,112,,
494,0.97,4637.232,4652.314,"I don't agree with Councilmember Nelson presenting this issue as if, if this is voted on in a committee today somehow that would be a hindrance for that discussion to happen.",112,,
495,0.97,4652.314,4652.748,It won't.,112,,
496,0.97,4652.748,4658.92,The executive session will still happen and city Councilmembers can still weigh in on different sides of it and bring amendments and vote on the amendments as they see fit.,112,,
497,0.97,4658.92,4663.558,After all the insights have been gleaned from the executive session.,112,,
498,0.97,4663.558,4665.394,None of that will be endured.,112,,
499,0.97,4665.394,4670.732,In my view the bill itself is not that complicated.,112,,
500,0.97,4670.732,4685.28,Rather than prolong the discussion here I think it makes sense to go ahead and take a vote on this and move forward based on what happens at the city council meeting.,112,,
501,0.97,4685.28,4694.756,Will the clerk please call the role on the amendment first?,112,,
502,0.97,4694.756,4702.297,The amendment that was presented and Seconded.,112,,
503,0.97,4702.297,4703.532,Councilmember Sawant?,113,,

527,0.97,4780.041,4782.244,I wish to change my vote if that's possible.,133,,
528,0.97,4782.244,4784.012,I don't know if that is possible.,133,,
529,0.97,4784.012,4794.389,Is that possible?,134,,
530,0.97,4796.725,4799.761,We have someone from the clerk's office that may be able to answer that.,135,,
531,0.97,4799.761,4805.133,Just to explain the process.,136,,
532,0.97,4805.133,4807.369,Is what is going before the Council the amended bill?,136,,
533,0.97,4807.369,4810.272,Yes.,137,,
534,0.97,4810.272,4811.973,That was going to happen regardless of the vote.,137,,
535,0.97,4811.973,4813.008,That's just the process.,137,,
536,0.97,4813.008,4814.843,That's why I was clarifying.,137,,
537,0.97,4814.843,4818.346,Regardless of the committee recommendation the bill goes to the city council.,137,,
538,0.97,4818.346,4819.181,Right.,138,,
539,0.97,4819.181,4826.221,I'm going to keep mine.,138,,

541,0.97,4826.655,4834.996,Based on the vote there is a recommendation from the committee to pass.,140,,
542,0.97,4834.996,4856.284,"The bill, as amended, in simple terms, simply adds that landlords can take the Advocation from Renters for financial hardship.",140,,
543,0.97,4856.284,4860.689,What the bill does is simply add that opportunity for landlords to rebut.,140,,
544,0.97,4860.689,4867.529,The bill has a recommendation from the committee and will go to the city council.,140,,
545,0.97,4867.529,4894.289,"Now Councilmember Sawant has the opportunity to make the motion to stem the rules for to be on the May 24th committee instead of May 30th, as discussed.",140,,

558,0.97,4976.237,4984.946,Before I dive into the presentation I just want to acknowledge that I'm going to be doing a lot of the speaking today.,142,,
559,0.97,4984.946,4987.782,The ose staff has done so much great work over the last year.,142,,
560,0.97,4987.782,4990.919,I just really want to acknowledge them because they are doing great work.,142,,
561,0.97,4990.919,4997.525,We are going to jump in . This is my first presentation in front of the Council.,142,,
562,0.97,4997.525,5011.606,I don't know if I should share my screen or if that happens through another mechanism.,142,,
563,0.97,5014.743,5016.378,I think you should share your screen.,143,,
564,0.97,5016.378,5017.078,It should work.,143,,
565,0.97,5017.078,5017.712,Usually that works.,143,,
566,0.97,5017.712,5018.513,Okay.,144,,
567,0.97,5018.513,5019.981,Let's do that then.,144,,
568,0.97,5019.981,5022.884,Okay.,144,,
569,0.97,5022.884,5023.952,Great.,144,,
570,0.97,5023.952,5027.756,Okay.,144,,
571,0.97,5027.756,5031.559,The agenda for this presentation is a very short overview of ose.,144,,
572,0.97,5031.559,5038.366,We will then jump into the Rsji accomplishments in 2021.,144,,
573,0.97,5038.366,5045.573,We will do a deep dive on two things we did this year.,144,,
574,0.97,5045.573,5051.179,"And then we will talk about what we will be doing over the next year, what we are looking forward to.",144,,
575,0.97,5051.179,5054.783,A very brief overview of ose.,144,,
576,0.97,5054.783,5055.85,I lost it.,144,,
577,0.97,5055.85,5064.559,Sorry about that.,144,,
578,0.97,5064.559,5066.895,Our work is centered around advancing environmental justice and Sustainability.,144,,
579,0.97,5066.895,5071.866,That really falls into three broad streams of work.,144,,
580,0.97,5071.866,5083.611,The first one is implementing a green new deal for Seattle by working with the city departments and community to invest in and support overburdened communities.,144,,
581,0.97,5083.611,5099.894,"The second work that we do is focusing on reducing carbon pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in buildings and transportation, while supporting a just transition to a clean energy future.",144,,
582,0.97,5099.894,5110.138,"We also build healthy and resilient communities that can adapt to the impacts of climate change and have equitable access to green spaces and healthy, culturally relevant food.",144,,
583,0.97,5110.138,5121.015,"All of our work is grounded in the equity and environment agenda, which was a community developed agenda to ensure everyone benefits from environmental progress in our city.",144,,
584,0.97,5121.015,5126.554,The purposes of this presentation were going to organize it into five sections.,144,,
585,0.97,5126.554,5137.365,"Community investments, service equity, policy and planning, and racial equity learning.",144,,
586,0.97,5137.365,5144.372,The first area that I'm going to focus on is environmental justice leadership.,144,,
587,0.97,5144.372,5152.413,That is really bringing in and centering environmental justice communities to shape city policy and play a meaningful roll in decision-making.,144,,
588,0.97,5152.413,5161.055,This really Manifests itself in the three boards and committees that we support.,144,,
589,0.97,5161.055,5166.094,"The green new deal oversight board, the environmental justice Committee, and the sweetened beverage tax committee advisory board.",144,,
590,0.97,5166.094,5175.77,One of the real accomplishments this year was launching the green new deal oversight.,144,,
591,0.97,5175.77,5177.805,Thank you to the Council for your leadership on this.,144,,
592,0.97,5177.805,5195.69,"Of course this board is about connecting front-line communities in the city and shaping policy programs that reduce climate pollution, increase jobs, and advanced equitable transition from fossil feels by Prioritizing communities most harmed by environmental injustices.",144,,
593,0.97,5195.69,5207.902,"This year the board established a vision, values, and goals . It is in the midst of creating budget recommendations for 2022 and 2023.",144,,
594,0.97,5207.902,5213.942,Once that work is concluded we will dive into creating a work plan for 2023 and 2024.,144,,
595,0.97,5213.942,5218.479,Next I will talk a little bit about the environmental justice committee.,144,,
596,0.97,5218.479,5224.285,This has been providing Front- line community leadership since 2017.,144,,
597,0.97,5224.285,5229.991,There are number of ways they engage in ose's work.,144,,
598,0.97,5229.991,5234.128,I will highlight two of them.,144,,
599,0.97,5234.128,5241.769,Ose is in concert with community members and other departments . They are updating the food action plan.,144,,
600,0.97,5241.769,5254.315,"The environmental justice committee created food justice principles at the outset of the process, hoping to out shape the engagement and the product of the food action plan.",144,,
601,0.97,5254.315,5259.954,"Secondly, it engages in equitable Roadmaps for policies.",144,,
602,0.97,5259.954,5268.062,We talked about this in later meetings . both of these efforts.,144,,
603,0.97,5268.062,5278.473,Our sweetened beverage tax committee advisory board really impacts a variety of ways we engage on food justice.,144,,
604,0.97,5278.473,5290.818,In particular the food action plan and early learning programs.,144,,
605,0.97,5290.818,5293.287,Those are some of the ways environmental justice leadership shapes city policy.,144,,
606,0.97,5293.287,5297.792,These next three are going to be about direct community investments.,144,,
607,0.97,5297.792,5309.07,The first one is the environmental justice Fund.,144,,
608,0.97,5309.07,5323.785,"Our approach throughout all of the investments we make in Seattle are made with deep partnership to black, indigenous, and other colored communities.",144,,
609,0.97,5323.785,5327.655,That is the case with the environmental justice Fund.,144,,
610,0.97,5327.655,5335.697,"We have received 146 proposals this year, totaling $2.5 million.",144,,
611,0.97,5335.697,5338.966,"We are able to award $750,000 to Community-Based organizations.",144,,
612,0.97,5338.966,5346.24,You can see a whole list here of fund Grantees.,144,,
613,0.97,5346.24,5364.459,The second way we invest in communities is through some of our programs that benefit individuals and community partners.,144,,
614,0.97,5364.459,5366.561,There are a bunch of different things that happened this year.,144,,
615,0.97,5366.561,5367.995,You can see a number of bullets.,144,,
616,0.97,5367.995,5369.797,I'm going to hit a couple of those.,144,,
617,0.97,5369.797,5371.966,Then we will talk more about them later in the presentation.,144,,
618,0.97,5371.966,5383.01,"We wrapped up Covid emergency grocery voucher programs, distributing $25 million in benefits to 14,000 people.",144,,
619,0.97,5383.01,5386.18,"Between March 2020 and April, 2021.",144,,
620,0.97,5386.18,5393.221,"We enrolled 12,000 Seattle households to receive $5.2 million in vouchers.",144,,
621,0.97,5393.221,5397.625,75% of those enrollees are from Rsji communities.,144,,
622,0.97,5397.625,5410.738,That is a direct outcome of our partnership with 12 community led organizations and rooted in Bipoc communities and refugee communities.,144,,
623,0.97,5410.738,5415.176,This is also the case with climate programming.,144,,
624,0.97,5415.176,5423.317,We provided 100% paid oil for low income households in partnership with the office of housing.,144,,
625,0.97,5423.317,5430.858,We provided Internships and learning opportunities via Benchmarking and Tuneups with South Seattle college.,144,,
626,0.97,5430.858,5441.102,"We advanced the Duwamish priorities through cross departmental efforts and investments in affordable housing, access to open space, and community health.",144,,
627,0.97,5441.102,5454.982,This next slide is an overview of how all of our grants contracts and purchasing reflects this priority of centering racial equity.,144,,
628,0.97,5454.982,5461.122,I'm going to draw your attention to the pie chart and talk through some of the different colors.,144,,
629,0.97,5461.122,5463.057,You can see the purple.,144,,
630,0.97,5463.057,5474.902,11% of our 4.3 million in expenditures goes to Wmbi businesses.,144,,
631,0.97,5474.902,5479.941,The blue is our EJ Fund.,144,,
632,0.97,5479.941,5488.516,That is another significant chunk of money that goes to Bipoc led organizations.,144,,
633,0.97,5488.516,5489.517,The school food program.,144,,
634,0.97,5489.517,5496.224,"That is our partnership with Seattle public schools to create culturally relevant, fresh foods in schools.",144,,
635,0.97,5496.224,5501.095,The team within SPs is a Bipoc led team.,144,,
636,0.97,5501.095,5505.333,I talked a little bit about that already.,144,,
637,0.97,5505.333,5506.501,Community support and outreach.,144,,
638,0.97,5506.501,5516.744,That's also those organizations that are helping connect community numbers to our program.,144,,
639,0.97,5516.744,5520.882,The next area I'm going to talk about is service equity.,144,,
640,0.97,5520.882,5534.695,"These are some of our programs that are intended to support access, particularly around Decarbonization programs.",144,,
641,0.97,5534.695,5543.738,"We are ensuring that our programs reached Bipoc businesses and individuals, mitigating all unintended consequences.",144,,
642,0.97,5543.738,5545.773,Here are a couple of ways we do that.,144,,
643,0.97,5545.773,5547.875,"Number one, through the efficient energy program.",144,,
644,0.97,5547.875,5561.389,We are Prioritizig those community owned buildings or buildings that have Community- based organizations as tenants.,144,,
645,0.97,5561.389,5563.858,An example of that is the South Park neighborhood center.,144,,
646,0.97,5563.858,5564.926,For priority energy Imrovements.,144,,
647,0.97,5564.926,5587.114,"We also are Prioritizing energy outreach, providing technical assistance in those priority neighborhoods . I also highlight some of the ways our program service impacts food quality.",144,,
648,0.97,5587.114,5597.625,"We are transferring vouchers to E benefits and we went through a process for that, so that we could design that program.",144,,
649,0.97,5597.625,5613.808,And also a recruitment of new retailers so that we are spending--these next two slides are about policy and planning.,144,,
650,0.97,5613.808,5623.351,The overall point I would make is that racial equity Infuses all of our policy and planning work.,144,,
651,0.97,5623.351,5627.221,Whether we are doing a formal Toolkit analysis or not.,144,,
652,0.97,5627.221,5638.933,"The first slide is actually about how we are using racial equity to inform policy and planning, even when we are not doing it with that particular program.",144,,
653,0.97,5638.933,5645.74,Our food action plan.,144,,
654,0.97,5645.74,5647.208,We are leading with racial equity on that.,144,,
655,0.97,5647.208,5653.814,Part of that includes deep engagement with the environmental justice committee and also other Bipoc food and justice leaders.,144,,
656,0.97,5653.814,5671.999,As we are looking at how to continue to the Carbonized buildings we are working in tandem with affordable housing advocates and communities serving buildings to make sure we are creating technical assistance and resources that meet their needs and keep housing affordable.,144,,
657,0.97,5671.999,5675.77,It also Prioritizes those buildings for transition.,144,,
658,0.97,5675.77,5687.248,We are deploying the first in the nation incentive program to convert diesel trucks to Electrification.,144,,
659,0.97,5687.248,5690.951,We are engaging with the East African committee to make sure equity is leading that work.,144,,
660,0.97,5690.951,5701.929,"Those are a few examples of how, even when we are not doing--this is part of what we're doing.",144,,
661,0.97,5701.929,5703.564,We do have racial equity Toolkits this year.,144,,
662,0.97,5703.564,5707.902,We did one on the E benefit transition.,144,,
663,0.97,5707.902,5712.006,We did one on road pricing for equitable mobility.,144,,
664,0.97,5712.006,5714.909,We did one on Carbon-Based building performance standards.,144,,
665,0.97,5714.909,5720.614,We did one on Seattle clean buildings accelerators.,144,,
666,0.97,5720.614,5727.221,We are now going to do a deep dive on the Carbon-Based holding performance standard.,144,,
667,0.97,5727.221,5739.433,"I'm going to turn it over to Robin, who is going to talk us through the transition.",144,,
668,0.97,5739.433,5740.868,Hello.,145,,
669,0.97,5740.868,5745.906,I am the fresh bucks program manager.,145,,
670,0.97,5745.906,5754.982,I will talk about what we did around the fresh bucks benefits last year.,145,,
671,0.97,5754.982,5756.984,We made the transition from paper vouchers to electronic benefits.,145,,
672,0.97,5756.984,5759.92,We did it late last year.,145,,
673,0.97,5759.92,5779.907,"The Toolkit we conducted, in advance of launching the electronic benefit platform, was really focused on how to make the transition in a way that would best serve the needs of fresh bucks customers, who might have the most difficult time with the transition to electronic benefits.",145,,
674,0.97,5779.907,5794.655,In particular those our customers with limited English proficiency and also folks with limited access to Tech Nowledge he resources.,145,,
675,0.97,5794.655,5813.507,"The racial equity Toolkit included robust engagement of community partners, retailers, and program participants to user test of the system before we launched.",145,,
676,0.97,5813.507,5813.974,Next slide.,145,,
677,0.97,5813.974,5821.715,Throughout this process we heard feedback from our customers and community partners that really emphasized some of the benefits of the transition to electronic benefits.,145,,
678,0.97,5821.715,5840.701,"That included the flexibility of the purchase amount of electronic benefits . After some difficulties customers faced after shopping with paper vouchers, which were issued in $10 increments, and needed to be spent in $10 increments.",145,,
679,0.97,5840.701,5860.321,Electronic benefits were also easier for customers and Cashiers to use . It offered a more discreet purchasing experience . The test process also revealed several steps where customers faced some confusion.,145,,
680,0.97,5860.321,5867.127,Like the need to activate the electronic benefits for the first time before they started using them.,145,,
681,0.97,5867.127,5869.597,And also navigating Point-Of- sale challenges with the new system.,145,,
682,0.97,5869.597,5881.242,This new issue is particularly amplified when the customer and the Cashier don't speak the same language.,145,,
683,0.97,5881.242,5894.054,As a result of these Toolkit Learnings our team has made several changes to support a more equitable implementation.,145,,
684,0.97,5894.054,5905.332,We created a Call-In activation line so folks with limited access to technology would be able to just call a phone number to activate their benefits before they started using them.,145,,
685,0.97,5905.332,5913.474,We also worked with our community enrollment partners to offer trusted language assistance for customers to activate their benefits.,145,,
686,0.97,5913.474,5933.861,"We also revised a testing and training protocol across the network to ensure there would be a robust understanding of the E benefits processing protocol, prior to implementation.",145,,
687,0.97,5933.861,5935.829,We also revised our customer communications.,145,,
688,0.97,5935.829,5947.341,We provided visually based communications . one of which was a How-To Video that was available in five languages most commonly spoken by our customers.,145,,
689,0.97,5947.341,5949.643,That's the fresh bucks segment.,145,,
690,0.97,5949.643,5954.782,Now we will hear from Sandra.,145,,
691,0.97,5954.782,5956.817,"Thank you, Robin.",146,,
692,0.97,5956.817,5959.453,This is Sandra.,146,,
693,0.97,5959.453,5967.194,I'm the program manager at the office of Sustainability.,146,,
694,0.97,5967.194,5970.998,I'm here to talk about a policy that we are in the process of developing.,146,,
695,0.97,5970.998,5978.972,Seattle would implement admission standards for Seattle's existing larger commercial and multifamily buildings.,146,,
696,0.97,5978.972,5991.552,"It's a policy that would build on the existing Washington state standard, which allows larger commercial buildings to meet energy targets starting in 2026.",146,,
697,0.97,5991.552,5998.325,Seattle's policy would establish corresponding emissions targets.,146,,
698,0.97,5998.325,6014.675,The targets would initially start higher and then they would Ratchet down over two decades until we have achieved net to zero carbon buildings by 2050.,146,,
699,0.97,6014.675,6018.846,We have predictability over long-term expectations but also flexibility on how a particular building would achieve the target.,146,,
700,0.97,6018.846,6023.183,We worked on a racial equity Toolkit from 2020 to 2021.,146,,
701,0.97,6023.183,6030.224,We are continuing to use and revise it in an ongoing tool for us.,146,,
702,0.97,6030.224,6034.928,We identified a number of key draft outcomes that the policy should achieve.,146,,
703,0.97,6034.928,6046.407,"The first of them, making sure we are providing support services for lower Resourced building owners to help alleviate impacts of the policy.",146,,
704,0.97,6046.407,6057.985,"Minimizing displacement risk and ensuring that, and implement in the policy, Bipoc communities benefit from the spaces.",146,,
705,0.97,6057.985,6070.364,It would create jobs . These clean energy careers can go to Bipoc and women.,146,,
706,0.97,6070.364,6080.04,"Due to Covid, impacts on external Stakeholder engagement was put on hold until 2021.",146,,
707,0.97,6080.04,6087.214,To develop these proposed outcomes we relied on previous community input.,146,,
708,0.97,6087.214,6096.49,"For example, the report Powering the transition and learning more about the impact.",146,,
709,0.97,6096.49,6099.993,And a series of cross departmental conversations.,146,,
710,0.97,6099.993,6102.229,One more.,146,,
711,0.97,6102.229,6109.837,"One of the clear needs that was identified, if you could back up . sorry.",146,,
712,0.97,6109.837,6116.043,In order to develop this policy we really needed that external Stakeholder engagement.,146,,
713,0.97,6116.043,6121.882,We are in the process of conducting a very robust and inclusive engagement process.,146,,
714,0.97,6121.882,6123.917,We actually had 350 folks at the first open house.,146,,
715,0.97,6123.917,6132.025,There is an affordable task force that is being led by the housing development consortium.,146,,
716,0.97,6132.025,6135.496,We have been doing focus groups with nonprofit owners.,146,,
717,0.97,6135.496,6140.534,We have had ongoing conversations with labor representatives.,146,,
718,0.97,6140.534,6142.269,This is an ongoing policy development process.,146,,
719,0.97,6142.269,6147.241,I do want to go ahead and go to the next slide.,146,,
720,0.97,6147.241,6148.475,Thank you.,146,,
721,0.97,6148.475,6155.983,I want to highlight some of the work that is underway to achieve our equity outcomes.,146,,
722,0.97,6155.983,6162.823,First of all is the jobs.,146,,
723,0.97,6162.823,6165.158,There should be 150 to 270 annual jobs anticipated from this policy.,146,,
724,0.97,6165.158,6177.137,"We have coordinated with FAS on a $1.8 million Rfp for clean energy jobs and construction training, Pre-Apprenticeship training.",146,,
725,0.97,6177.137,6179.74,We are doing technical assistance.,146,,
726,0.97,6179.74,6192.119,"Before we even put in place a regulation we have launched a preliminary support program, Prioritized again to under Resourced building owners.",146,,
727,0.97,6192.119,6196.39,We help them to comply both with the state Standard and to prepare for emissions targets.,146,,
728,0.97,6196.39,6215.275,"In the policy itself in our draft framework we are facing compliance, such that the larger commercial buildings, the buildings with the greatest impact and owners with the greatest resources can take action first.",146,,
729,0.97,6215.275,6217.778,Then smaller buildings and multifamily buildings will have a much longer Ramp-Up period.,146,,
730,0.97,6217.778,6237.798,"We are also proposing greater flexibility and more support for buildings where we know there will be cost constraints and upgrades will be more difficult for owners . again, Nonprofits, owners with financial hardship, Unreinforced masonry, affordable housing.",146,,
731,0.97,6237.798,6243.804,We are also actively working to secure funding for capital upgrades.,146,,
732,0.97,6243.804,6251.845,Not just technical assistance but also helping owners comply with the money in the bank to go toward capital upgrades.,146,,
733,0.97,6251.845,6264.024,We have reallocated some previous funds toward capital grants to Pilate two or three priority housing projects to D Carbonized.,146,,
734,0.97,6264.024,6269.563,We have another grant proposal from the Department of energy for affordable housing.,146,,
735,0.97,6269.563,6277.17,We are very closely tracking the infrastructure opportunities that should be coming out this fall.,146,,
736,0.97,6277.17,6277.471,Thank you.,146,,
737,0.97,6277.471,6288.415,I will turn it over to Stephanie.,146,,

777,0.97,6504.064,6512.005,Obviously ose.,149,,
778,0.97,6512.005,6521.548,-- the times we are living in call for those . for that emphasis.,149,,
779,0.97,6521.548,6524.05,I appreciated that.,149,,
780,0.97,6524.05,6530.824,"The open house that you mentioned about building admission standards, I also want to congratulate you for that.",149,,
781,0.97,6530.824,6531.825,I did that from my office.,149,,
782,0.97,6531.825,6536.93,I was the policy analyst for that office.,149,,
783,0.97,6536.93,6538.365,Also the clerk attended that open house.,149,,
784,0.97,6538.365,6544.404,If you wanted to add anything from your experience there you are welcome to.,149,,
785,0.97,6544.404,6554.915,"I just wanted to underscore, based on the most recent data that we have, it is reported that greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025.",149,,
786,0.97,6554.915,6563.323,"Just imagine what a tall order that is, given where we are.",149,,
787,0.97,6563.323,6565.358,It's obviously not just about the city of Seattle.,149,,
788,0.97,6565.358,6567.06,This is a global challenge that we are facing.,149,,
789,0.97,6567.06,6585.512,The greenhouse gas emissions have to peak in 2025 and then be halved in the next 10 years to give the world a chance of limiting future heating . If that doesn't happen the world faces a catastrophic increase of three degrees Celsius.,149,,
790,0.97,6585.512,6596.69,"In spite of all of these warnings, and this is just the latest warning, big business and governments continue to make investments to produce new fossil fuels, adding to the disaster.",149,,
791,0.97,6596.69,6599.159,We mentioned it before in this Committee.,149,,
792,0.97,6599.159,6611.671,It was reported that the world's biggest 60 banks provided nearly $4 trillion of financing for fossil fuel companies since the climate deal in 2015.,149,,
793,0.97,6611.671,6633.526,"Despite the dramatic reduction in energy use at that time, because of the Lockdown and stay at home work from the pandemic, the overall fossil fuel funding Astoundingly remained on an upward trend.",149,,
794,0.97,6637.864,6639.666,Fossil fuels in 2020 was higher than in 2016.,149,,
795,0.97,6639.666,6642.802,Which is a shocking but clarifying indictment of capitalism's inability to solve the climate crisis.,149,,
796,0.97,6642.802,6647.974,"In that context especially the work of any group of individuals that is working against it, that is to be appreciated.",149,,
797,0.97,6647.974,6659.619,"I also wanted to mention that under the policy and planning slide, and as you mentioned just now, the Electrification is an exciting program.",149,,
798,0.97,6659.619,6670.363,"The trucks that take shipping containers back and forth from the port to the train station, they are quote Unquote independent contractors.",149,,
799,0.97,6670.363,6678.972,They often drive their own trucks and they are paid poverty wages.,149,,
800,0.97,6678.972,6682.142,The crisis that they have been in is a Long-Standing one.,149,,
801,0.97,6682.142,6694.654,We have wanted to organize them but it is full of obstacles because of the independent contractor designation.,149,,
802,0.97,6694.654,6708.468,Ose has funds to Electrify trucks because those drivers sit there all day with idling diesel fuel engines.,149,,
803,0.97,6708.468,6710.37,It's a terrible source of greenhouse gases.,149,,
804,0.97,6710.37,6718.044,It's an important pilot.,149,,
805,0.97,6718.044,6718.878,It is starting modestly.,149,,
806,0.97,6718.878,6721.214,Hopefully we will be successful and it can be implemented more broadly.,149,,
807,0.97,6721.214,6723.983,If you wanted to add any points on that you are welcome to.,149,,

811,0.97,6735.295,6748.041,"I will only add that I think this is an exciting opportunity to learn how to do this, and then build out the plan to scale.",150,,
812,0.97,6748.041,6754.981,There are 1000 trucks that idle on city streets and 4000 across the region.,150,,
813,0.97,6754.981,6760.72,"Really doing good, deep policy work that is focused on how to build out is really part of what we are doing.",150,,
814,0.97,6760.72,6772.398,We are looking forward to reporting more on that as we implement the program.,150,,
815,0.97,6772.398,6772.899,Definitely.,151,,
