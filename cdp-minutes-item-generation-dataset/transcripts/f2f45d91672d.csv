72,0.97,361.527,371.738,The use of Psychedelics allowed me to investigate the root causes of my depression and fix it.,21,,
73,0.97,371.738,378.211,"You heard from the symposium how it has helped addiction, depression, and end of life trauma.",21,,

80,0.97,425.291,429.395,They are not just free standing families for nuclear families.,23,,
81,0.97,429.395,433.065,They are for families of all shapes and sizes.,23,,
82,0.97,433.065,442.308,This is a great step that acknowledges that historically our single-family zones contain a multitude of residential and family types.,23,,
83,0.97,442.308,451.918,I would like to show my appreciation for Councilmembers Mosqueda and Strauss.,23,,
84,0.97,451.918,457.523,I have been forced to create households with many people in similar situations.,23,,
85,0.97,457.523,464.831,This name would accurately reflect people like me struggling to find a place in Seattle but are still building and contributing to the neighborhood.,23,,

93,0.97,499.532,505.504,And every time I hear single family it feels like you are saying not people like you.,25,,
94,0.97,505.504,513.946,"Yeah, the people I was with now are legally considered kin but that wasn't the case when we chose this kind of housing.",25,,
95,0.97,513.946,519.986,This is a reminder that it's about belonging as much as building for.,25,,
96,0.97,519.986,529.896,Changing the name doesn't go far enough to change that but goes to show ongoing land use for socially acceptable neighbors.,25,,
97,0.97,529.896,534.233,"Thank you to Melissa hall for sharing her thoughts and thank you, Council, for passing this through.",25,,

103,0.97,570.369,583.282,As others noted single family zoning has become inaccurate considering the diverse uses and household structures.,27,,
104,0.97,583.282,595.661,And it has a past that doesn't reflect our value of the city and a path that has done harm and bountiful research linking single family zoning to these impacts around the country.,27,,

112,0.97,654.453,673.572,Perhaps we need an investigation of city Council and how much alcohol they drink in between Council meetings where they come up with policy that Emdanger the innocent community and permeate the whole of the neighborhood that endangers he was and makes living in Seattle the oppressive will hell.,29,,
113,0.97,673.572,682.114,The city council is the most racist and corrupt in all of the nation.,29,,

442,0.97,2920.05,2935.766,This bill is a legislation from the city of Seattle Department of construction to try and find the tenant's relocation ordinance that applies to buildings that exist for the affordable housing program.,111,,
443,0.97,2935.766,2953.55,The ordinance known--requires building owners to pay relocation assistance when they displace Renters through No- fault Eviction to Demolish or Remodel the building or similar use.,111,,
444,0.97,2953.55,2964.561,"And this bill is pretty straightforward making it clear, that the multi-family program counts as that part of change of use.",111,,
445,0.97,2964.561,2970.2,There are a couple of buildings in Seattle expected to exempt the program.,111,,
446,0.97,2970.2,2989.486,The department walked through one such building and estimated approximately 10 percent of the tenants would be eligible for relocation assistance because of the restriction that you can't use your roommate against you.,111,,
447,0.97,2989.486,3010.607,"Residents of some affordable homes will be eligible this year, and I appreciate the willingness to Sthend bill directly to Council, to the city council today and I urge the Councilmembers to consider it.",111,,

477,0.97,3129.192,3131.761,"Thank you, Madam President.",134,,
478,0.97,3131.761,3150.38,"To flag everybody, there is not really any substitute changes but reflects back in terms of the wording around the office of government relations interaction with the policy based on feedback from the Department at the time of initial introduction.",134,,
479,0.97,3150.38,3165.762,"It did not reflect the nuance of how Oir would prefer their advocacy at the state level to be framed, specifically, the original resolution that instructed them to write legislation.",134,,
480,0.97,3165.762,3181.444,"We have other partners that will write the legislation and be more in a position of supporting the detail, and that is the only significant change.",134,,
481,0.97,3181.444,3187.851,"And otherwise, it's generally reflects the substance of version one.",134,,
482,0.97,3187.851,3198.495,"And Madam President, I don't know if you--are we going to vote on the adoption now and then I'll speak to the resolution more broadly after that?",134,,

503,0.97,3259.289,3261.958,"Nine in favor, and none opposed.",149,,
504,0.97,3261.958,3272.235,Motion carried and now adopted and I will hand it back over to Councilmember Lewis to address the resolution.,150,,
505,0.97,3272.235,3289.185,"Thank you, Madam president and appreciate the opportunity to take the first legislative step in what was a fairly long Ngagement process and certainly something we can't be accused of rushing much to the consternation of our Stakeholders on this.",151,,
506,0.97,3289.185,3306.169,I do think that the resolve has been a really good deep dive into the nuances of the policy around the substances and current policy of our local prosecuting attorneys as well as the Seattle police Department.,151,,
507,0.97,3306.169,3342.472,I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for her leadership as chair of the underlying committee throughout this process which began in earnest in the spring with our decisions with folks at Decrim nature Seattle and became more formalized with a letter written by the Council in June to urge the Overdose and recovery task force to study this issue throughout the summer and Pomelgate back to us the recommendations.,151,,
508,0.97,3342.472,3394.257,"We received the recommendations in August to adopt a resolution or an ordinance or some other representation of city policy to emphasize to the extent of our powers and municipality that law enforcement around Entheogen is the lowest priority to enforce the law in regards to those substances, and this resolution before us today is a way to get on the record in support of these policy goals before our budget process really gets rolling and before the state Legislature convenes in January to Holistically consider drug policy as the ongoing policy posts the Supreme Court's decision.",151,,
509,0.97,3394.257,3417.947,"The policy in front of us is limited to natural substances, most Famously throughout this process the Thoaft cited, and not included the synthetic Psychedelics.",151,,
510,0.97,3417.947,3418.481,An example would be LSD.,151,,
511,0.97,3418.481,3453.883,"This has been an interesting process to really learn more about the substances and things that I did not know, and meeting with Decrim nature Seattle, this is part of a broader policy conversation nationally and following on the heels of similar resolutions that have been passed in cities like Denver, Colorado; Washington, D.C.; Oakland, California among other jurisdictions.",151,,
512,0.97,3453.883,3463.693,"And, of course, whole sale law changes to Oregon that passed with a convincing margin in recent elections.",151,,
513,0.97,3463.693,3510.34,"I want to note a bit to the viewing public some of the things that have really driven me to take a keen interest in that and how I think this resolution really sets the stage as the first significant action in the state of Washington to move the policy forward affirmed by any government, local or state or County and that's really to state that these Non-Addictive natural substances have real potential in clinical and therapeutic ways to change people's lives.",151,,
514,0.97,3510.34,3535.498,"And for me, meeting with constituents and people that have had experiences with the substances have helped them to materially overcome addiction, helped them overcome severe depression or other behavioral conditions that made a point in their lives that they don't know where they would have been without the access to treatments with therapy connected to some of these substances.",151,,
515,0.97,3535.498,3584.047,"Given that Seattle is host to one of the world premiere medical research universities at the University of Washington and given the strong support throughout this process from many of the clinical faculty at the University of Washington psychiatry and behavioral mental health and medical research, it's just made it evident that Seattle would be a place where in the long-term we really are a Hub or innovation around what possibility the substances could produce in terms in our ongoing struggle as a civilization of people against these debilitating conditions.",151,,
516,0.97,3584.047,3605.501,"I do want to briefly address at the end of my remarks here, and we heard a little bit in the public comment, the discussion around Peyote, and I want to address it briefly that this resolution is not as currently worded inclusive of Peyote.",151,,
517,0.97,3605.501,3618.281,"Our local chapter of Decriminalize nature did not want to include it because there is, as we heard, disagreement of the inclusion of the substance.",151,,
518,0.97,3618.281,3631.527,"You know, I want to thank the National chapter of Decriminalize nature for their letter that was distributed to this Council last week advocating for the inclusion of Peyote.",151,,
519,0.97,3631.527,3673.503,"There is no doubt or disagreement that it's a is Kraed resource to the indigenous people in the Southwestern United States who live with Peyote for thousands of years but because there is disagreement to reverse the century along decline of Peyote and appropriate use of it and increased access or isolates are approached for now in this resolution, myself and the Stakeholders, the local chapters of Decrim nature have kept Peyote out of it.",151,,
520,0.97,3673.503,3705.435,"However, any potential forthcoming Council actions, for example, if some of this were manifested into a more formal ordinance with Permanency, it's a discussion I'm willing to have with the leading issues of the Council because it has to be Crafted with careful consideration for the impact and be sensitive with the policy related to Peyote.",151,,
521,0.97,3705.435,3721.517,"So I did just want to make the comments that we are certainly sensitive and look forward to continuing to to look into it, but this current resolution does not touch on it.",151,,
522,0.97,3721.517,3737.467,"So with that, I don't have any additional comments, Madam President, and certainly, I'm excited to get this over the line and do it before the budget takes up more of my life.",151,,
523,0.97,3737.467,3737.967,"So, thank you.",151,,
524,0.97,3737.967,3741.471,Thank you so much.,152,,
525,0.97,3741.471,3742.038,Appreciate those remarks.,152,,
526,0.97,3742.038,3752.415,Are there any additional comments on the resolution?,152,,
527,0.97,3752.415,3753.015,"Councilmember Sawant, please.",152,,
528,0.97,3753.015,3753.983,Thank you.,153,,
529,0.97,3753.983,3759.989,"I am, of course, voting yes on this initiation.",153,,
530,0.97,3759.989,3775.905,"My office has been from the very first moment we heard from the activists from Decriminalize nature, and many of the clinical and medical experts, some of the most dominant ones incidentally reside in district three.",153,,
531,0.97,3775.905,3793.723,"Since that very moment in my office, we have been in strong support of Decriminalizing Psychedelics with the research has been absolutely overwhelming as well as the public comment has testified to.",153,,
532,0.97,3793.723,3798.327,I appreciate specifically the individual who testified from personal experience.,153,,
533,0.97,3798.327,3801.03,I really appreciate that.,153,,
534,0.97,3801.03,3809.338,"However, as I mentioned last week, I am a little confused by this resolution because it's a resolution and not an argument.",153,,
535,0.97,3809.338,3817.68,And why this resolution is passed when there is an ordinance from my office and it has been available for months.,153,,
536,0.97,3817.68,3829.692,The resolution asks the police to codify policies to effectively De-Criminalize Psychedelic drugs.,153,,
537,0.97,3829.692,3831.961,My office strongly supports the resolution.,153,,
538,0.97,3831.961,3841.604,We have in fact advocated for and won the resolution in the past but we have not passed the resolution.,153,,
539,0.97,3841.604,3862.258,I think it's political from a standpoint for the Council to add an ordinance to Decriminalize Psychedelics in rhetoric would require an ordinance and it's the city Council and not the period that has the authority to pass the ordinance.,153,,
540,0.97,3862.258,3882.311,"Councilmembers will remember June 29th, a few months ago, my office had a Council bill that would have done just that, and just in response to some of the public comment today on an issue that has not been resolved.",153,,
541,0.97,3882.311,3897.994,"If you are looking at the whole spectrum of Peyote to discuss with my office so that we can understand if there are any amendments to be made to the ordinance that we have put forward, I would really like to learn more about that issue.",153,,
542,0.97,3897.994,3902.231,I certainly appreciate those who spoke in public comment about it.,153,,
543,0.97,3902.231,3922.318,"The bill from my office was signed by Councilmember Herbold, the chair of the committee, and Unfortunately, though, has languished on the desk for the last few months, and the Council has not--I mean, today in the comments so far, the ordinance has not been acknowledged.",153,,
544,0.97,3922.318,3925.388,The Existences has not been acknowledged.,153,,
545,0.97,3925.388,3929.959,"I think the only change at heart from Councilmembers is well, it was not resolved.",153,,
546,0.97,3929.959,3935.998,"Let's resolve those things, and why do a resolution?",153,,
547,0.97,3935.998,3937.333,Let's do an ordinance.,153,,
548,0.97,3937.333,3953.983,"I fail to see the ordinance sit in the city's computers, and the resolution which only has a power to make a request.",153,,
549,0.97,3953.983,3981.877,"I said I will be voting yes on this resolution and I'm grateful to the activists and urge you to keep mobilizing, and please understand that we need an ordinance to be passed for real Paction and actual changes to be seen in the city of Seattle on the issue of Psychedelics and Decriminalizing Psychedelics.",153,,
550,0.97,3981.877,3996.826,I urge all Councilmembers to correspond with me and discuss any amendments that need to be made based on local and national activists.,153,,
551,0.97,3996.826,3997.126,Thank you.,153,,
552,0.97,3997.259,4000.329,Thank you so much.,154,,
553,0.97,4000.329,4000.863,Councilmember Herbold?,154,,
554,0.97,4000.996,4003.299,Thank you.,155,,
555,0.97,4003.299,4010.206,I appreciate that Councilmember Sawant has--I don't think it's been referred yet.,155,,
556,0.97,4010.206,4013.943,I think we held it and did not refer it yet.,155,,
557,0.97,4013.943,4021.517,I don't think it's true that it was languishing on my desk.,155,,
558,0.97,4021.517,4057.253,"But Nevertheless, after discussion about whether or not the bill should be referred to my Committee, we agreed as a Council that we were going to old taking action until we received recommendation from the Overdose emergency innovative recovery task force especially because we are aware that there are going to be efforts in the wake of the decision and in the wake of legislation that was passed last session to respond to the Blake decision.",155,,
559,0.97,4057.253,4074.303,"It's going to be I think, a really robust discussion at the state level about enforcement of not just Entheogen but enforcement of possession of other drugs that are posed for personal use.",155,,
560,0.97,4074.303,4094.457,"So I think we are trying to be really sensitive to those discussions that are about to occur on a state wide level, and that's why we asked the task force to give up the recommendations because this task force is not just working on the issue of Psychedelics.",155,,
561,0.97,4094.457,4114.41,"They will be working on a broader issue of drugs that are Impacting with district impacts across the spectrum of drug law enforcement and have, you know, for decades, for generations.",155,,
562,0.97,4114.41,4146.108,So the recommendation that we receive from the task force was specifically that municipalities in the state of Washington and elsewhere that had independent ordinance Criminalizing Psychedelics and those that don't should direct their law enforcement and prosecutors to De-Criminalize enforcement and publically communicate this as policy.,155,,
563,0.97,4146.108,4190.052,When I reached out to the police Department to make a determine phase we need to communicate this lowest law enforcement priority to the police Department based on my understanding of the police Department communication is not only the lowest law enforcement policy but that officers had been instructed to no longer detain nor arrest individuals under Rcw 6950413 and no longer Confiscate a drug from an individual based on the violation.,155,,
564,0.97,4190.052,4193.622,And we know that policies might change.,155,,
565,0.97,4193.622,4195.958,This is the existing policy of the Seattle police Department.,155,,
566,0.97,4195.958,4201.797,"We, as the city Council, are expressing our support for this complete policy.",155,,
567,0.97,4201.797,4230.526,"I recognize that at a later date, depending on what happens at the state Legislature, and what happens under the leadership of a new Mayor or police chief or city attorney we may need more action but I am appreciative of Councilmember Lewis of bringing this resolution forward.",155,,
568,0.97,4230.526,4234.229,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,156,,
569,0.97,4234.229,4236.565,Kenner with Sawant?,156,,
570,0.97,4236.699,4237.266,Thank you.,157,,
571,0.97,4237.266,4241.003,I wanted to clarify for the record.,157,,
572,0.97,4241.003,4249.144,I am surprised by Councilmember Herbold's response on the question of the process or the ordinance in my office.,157,,
573,0.97,4249.144,4274.27,"It has indeed been on Councilmember Herbold's desk as chair for the safety Committee for two months, and Councilmember Herbold and other Councilmembers might remember the discussion two months ago that I pointed out that someone from my office had called her office 22 times about it asking her office to click the one button to allow the bill to be introduced, the ordinance to be introduced.",157,,
574,0.97,4274.27,4278.24,None of those calls were returned.,157,,
575,0.97,4278.24,4294.289,"All of this discussion happened in public but it seems from Councilmember Herbold who said at the beginning of her comments just now, it was implied that somehow an agreement among the Council that the bill should not be introduced.",157,,
576,0.97,4294.289,4296.425,But that's not true.,157,,
577,0.97,4296.425,4297.326,There was no vote.,157,,
578,0.97,4297.326,4302.331,I wanted the bill to be introduced.,157,,
579,0.97,4302.331,4306.268,They did discuss and voted on as soon as possible.,157,,
580,0.97,4306.268,4313.942,I have not complained about all of this at any great length because I was hoping that Councilmember Lewis would bring in the ordinance.,157,,
581,0.97,4313.942,4338.2,"And many times when the Democrats will bring their own audience for us, and she was more important in the--you know, the legislation but it is a tangible failure at this point to bring forward an ordinance, and that is why I feel I need to raise this issue.",157,,
582,0.97,4338.2,4342.137,This is not how it happened.,157,,
583,0.97,4342.137,4357.286,"My staff and I followed up continuously wanting the ordinance to move forward but often these kind of bureaucratic channels are used to block it, and that's fine.",157,,
584,0.97,4357.286,4357.986,That's your decision.,157,,
585,0.97,4357.986,4375.304,"And again, that's an ordinance moving forward, and I appreciate the Councilmembers to discuss whatever outstanding issues there are and act on it.",157,,
586,0.97,4375.304,4381.41,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",158,,
587,0.97,4381.41,4385.18,Your objection is noted for the record.,158,,
588,0.97,4385.18,4392.821,I would like to refocus and debate the resolution before us as opposed to an ordinance that is not before us at the time.,158,,
589,0.97,4392.821,4402.331,"So if we could Recommit to just focusing our comments on the amended resolution before us, I appreciate it.",158,,
590,0.97,4402.331,4411.707,"Again, I appreciate that Councilmember Sawant has concerned expressed over the ordinance and is noted.",158,,
591,0.97,4411.707,4417.646,Let's go ahead and finish up our debate on the resolution.,158,,
592,0.97,4417.646,4435.397,"I am going to give Councilmember Lewis the last word and before the last word, I see Councilmember Mosqueda has her hand raised.",158,,
593,0.97,4435.397,4438.534,"Thank you, Council President, and that's the kind of comments I wanted to make.",159,,
594,0.97,4438.534,4453.549,I wanted to Centre-Back on the recommendation that comes from the community and task force and the folks who have been researching the issues and exploring the benefits of the substances and wanting to make sure we have an understanding of why.,159,,
595,0.97,4453.549,4466.195,To me this comes down to a public health approach to those who may see some benefits of having some substances to be available to them to treat things near and dear to my heart.,159,,
596,0.97,4466.195,4489.618,"As many people know, my sisters suffers with multiple sclerosis and trying to train her brain for what her body goes through I am excited about any opportunity to have her have a healthy and safe life and experience joy for her mind and her body as well.",159,,
597,0.97,4489.618,4507.536,"I can see there is a lot of possibilities for folks who have traumatic brain injuries and dealing with Immunocompromised systems, and folks suffering from Ptsd and have depression and anxiety.",159,,
598,0.97,4507.536,4561.823,"Any opportunity we can especially in the wake of Covid, to find solutions for folks in a safe way and a way that helps people to access safe substances is something that I will support from a public health perfect respective and appreciate the research that has gone into this with people that have been supporting this research and advocacy for years and a way to relieve the stress and anxiety and the complications within our mind and body, and I look forward to future work with all of you to see how we can convince the--advance the commitment and thank you for making this public and Accessing through the public main and I am excited with the opportunities in the future.",159,,

788,0.97,5394.355,5412.907,As the supply of Tdr credit slows this allows us to purchase credits from Pierce and Snohomish County and encouraging preservation in more of our region and allowing for the continued growth we need it Seattle.,286,,

817,0.97,5532.326,5568.362,"The legislation AMENDS the comprehensive plan to change to residential areas, a term that reflects the reality on the ground today as the so-called single family areas that include houses with multiple families or unrelated roommates and attached and Deattached dwelling units, legacy Duplexes and legacy apartment buildings built before the current rules took effect and multifamily units that are built in areas that no longer allow them to be built.",308,,
818,0.97,5568.362,5582.476,Thus neighborhood residential reflects the reality on the ground that there are many types of buildings that make our residential areas vibrant and many building types that are already in what we know now as single family dwelling.,308,,

822,0.97,5619.647,5626.02,I have heard--I have heard concerns from community members this leads to so many different things.,308,,
823,0.97,5626.02,5633.461,What I think we need to be grounded in today is what we have before us is a bill that changes the name of these zones.,308,,
824,0.97,5633.461,5634.362,It does not change the zoning.,308,,
825,0.97,5634.362,5637.598,It does not change the uses.,308,,

827,0.97,5641.902,5646.173,It simply changes the name and what we call areas of our city.,308,,

841,0.97,5734.128,5762.456,"As you noted, there were multiple public hearings and Committee conversations that we had, and with Councilmember Morales's office had a conversation that rooted with the conversation today with the racial equity tool kit and many discussions in the community including making sure that the 17 neighborhood plans who have currently Referenced single family homes were reached out to and knew about the potential change.",310,,
842,0.97,5762.456,5803.797,"We received 400 individuals and organizations who wrote into us with comments about the 17 neighborhoods and appreciated making sure that I am clarifying for the record how much public engagement was done on this with the 17 directly affected neighborhoods, and again as Councilmember Strauss has accurately summarized once again for the record the importance of the name change but also centering us on the fact that this is just a name change to address a DIS Nomer in statue misrepresenting the city we are and the fabric that we are in now.",310,,
843,0.97,5803.797,5808.502,I will include the three comments in letters of support from community members.,310,,
844,0.97,5808.502,5827.655,"The first from the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, the letter States it's true that the legislation is a simple name change but Seattle must take the first step of passing Council bill 120155 as well as address the historic and ongoing impact of Exclusionary zoning through changes in existing politics.",310,,
845,0.97,5827.655,5839.934,The other letter from the housing consortium saying with this amendment you are laying ground work to create more opportunities for housing and neighborhoods in Seattle in the upcoming comprehensive plan update.,310,,
846,0.97,5839.934,5862.089,"This is a down payment on a purpose for opportunity and more opportunity for people in the city and families and children to have access to wonderful neighborhoods across our city, and finally from habitat for humanity from Seattle, saying one example of the kind of change we can see even more Bypassing this proposal is the work.",310,,
847,0.97,5862.089,5880.474,"On Saturday, we were blessed to have the opportunity to celebrate the completion of our most recent development on this site where we turned one single family home into 13 permanent affordable moments and today there are 13 families living in South Park in part because of the zoning flexible that is required.",310,,
848,0.97,5880.474,5889.783,"By authorizing this legislation you are taking one step, an important step in continuing to move Seattle to a place where everyone has a place to call home.",310,,
849,0.97,5889.783,5900.761,I raised these three letters of the example of the diverse types of comments that we received and the diverse type of entities that have written in to support this important but simple piece of legislation in front of us.,310,,
850,0.97,5900.761,5909.97,"As we propose neighborhood residential, we are in all aspects recognizing that language matters.",310,,
851,0.97,5909.97,5933.961,"We are recognizing that neighborhoods are diverse homes to housing and Commerce and diverse homes to parks and services, diverse homes to neighborhood Amenitys that make the neighborhoods more Walkable so everyone can access all things they need without ever having to get in a car.",310,,
852,0.97,5933.961,5950.444,"The reality is, quote, single family only doesn't reflect the current use and makeup of our neighborhoods that really have Duplexes and Triplexes, row houses, connected homes and courtyards and apartments like the one I lived in in Queen Anne that was zoned out and banned from being in Existences.",310,,
853,0.97,5950.444,5971.098,"So I want to thank, finally, the members of the housing--excuse me of the Seattle planning Commission who, as we talked about before have recommended year over year every single time that the planning Commission has sent recommendations to Council and to the Mayor since 2018 they have reflected for this proposal to be included.",310,,
854,0.97,5971.098,6024.018,"I spoke with members of the planning Commission before 2018 and they said we knew that before 2018 as well but they are very happy to see it finally move into action and in addition to the 400 individuals and organizations who we are working with on getting the feedback from the 17 neighborhoods, letters and communications are sent to all communities affected and deep conversations especially here in district one, the Morgan junction community Association and in July we meet or members of my office met with the West Seattle neighborhoods and I bring them up to show how important they are with just a name change because we will call on the same individuals and organizations and folks with differing opinions to set the stage for the 2023 comprehensive plan.",310,,
855,0.97,6024.018,6033.961,"Throughout 2022, we will build on the discussions this year and make informed policy discussions and rooted in what community is informing us of.",310,,

880,0.97,6218.111,6252.679,And I also believe this will better reflect and include residents of the neighborhood and hope that the zoning will move forward to reflect our city's rapid growth in the last decade and look forward to continuing to support the Council's work and allow more neighbors to invite those additional families into all of our neighborhoods.,321,,

919,0.97,6425.786,6426.586,Thank you to Councilmember Juarez.,344,,
920,0.97,6426.586,6447.974,This legislation as transmitted includes amendments to manufacturing areas and the amendments had to be removed in committee because Fepa was not concluded on those changes.,344,,

929,0.97,6489.983,6493.62,Sorry.,346,,
930,0.97,6493.62,6497.424,Taking me a while.,346,,
931,0.97,6497.424,6504.931,"I want to make sure that is item number nine, AMENDS to the comprehensive plan?",346,,
932,0.97,6505.065,6505.699,This is item 13.,347,,
933,0.97,6505.699,6506.032,Thank you.,348,,
934,0.97,6506.032,6522.649,"I will be voting yes on the comprehensive amendment this year because I do not object to any of the amendments as contained but the fact that yet again, Councilmembers have left out developers is just stunning and completely unacceptable.",348,,
935,0.97,6522.649,6540.967,"The developer fees are the fees that the city could charge for profit developers to raise tens of millions of dollars in Progressive revenue to fund growth and public transit, and in fact, other cities in Washington state charge developer fees.",348,,
936,0.97,6540.967,6546.473,"As an illustration, developer impact fees in Seattle could have funded $40 million worth of public transit expansion.",348,,
937,0.97,6546.473,6557.317,"I want to quote what I said on September 29th of last year, one year and five days ago, quote, I want to be clear that I object to being left out of the bill.",348,,
938,0.97,6557.317,6562.522,"In particular, there is no mention of developer impact fees.",348,,
939,0.97,6562.522,6586.479,"Developer impact fees can only be passed into law after the comprehensive plan, and the comprehensive plan is amended only once each year so the fact that the developer impact fees are not included in this bill means we have to wait another year for the opportunity to make the developers, the corporate developers pay for the impact they have on our city's infrastructure.",348,,
940,0.97,6586.479,6591.818,Unfortunately there is a long and bureaucratic process for establishing the impact fees.,348,,
941,0.97,6591.818,6601.394,Before they can be passed they need to be in the comprehensive plan and before they are put in the comprehensive plan they need to be under the state's environmental protect act.,348,,
942,0.97,6601.394,6619.646,"And the developer impact fees were included in the resolution that the council passed last year, listing the issues that should be studied for this year's comprehensive plan f we had developer impact fees available this year we could raise the funds.",348,,
943,0.97,6619.779,6620.847,[end end quote.,348,,
944,0.97,6620.847,6654.214,"So keep in mind these are were my comments from last year, so this year means last year and then two years back, and once again, the Environmental protection agency said that the study has not been done to allow us to be included in the comprehensive plan despite the fact that it was in the list of things to be done for this year's comprehensive plan and despite many, many falls from Councilmembers, and from past Councilmembers and the current ones.",348,,
945,0.97,6654.214,6708.401,"In July of last year, the council voted yes to include an amendment from my officers to a transportation funding bill that added the follows clauses, I quote, whereas developer impact fees can be established by as early as 2021 to establish Metrobus, the developer impact fees are progressive funding paid for by large corporate developers and that the Seattle Council plans to complete in 2020 the developer impact fees for 2021 and whereas the Council is committed to developing the impact fees in 2021 to raise not less than $40 million to increase funding for Metrobus, end quote.",348,,
946,0.97,6708.401,6713.339,This was accepted by the Council to a transportation funding bill.,348,,
947,0.97,6713.339,6738.231,"Unfortunately, that requires the chair of the Council committees for single land use to Prioritize impact fees for their committee and it's clear that neither Councilmember Pedersen or Strauss who chaired the commits have agreed to do that this year but the council as a whole, the council as a whole has not Prioritized impact fees in any way.",348,,
948,0.97,6738.231,6757.35,"This is a clear demonstration of the inordinate power that they have, and how the politicians go along with that despite the rhetoric I hear here.",348,,
949,0.97,6757.35,6760.854,"In 2021, it was Prioritized by Councilmembers.",348,,
950,0.97,6760.854,6762.422,All of this happened behind Clsed doors.,348,,
951,0.97,6762.422,6773.633,Society public don't know whom to blame and why fees are not moving forward and why is it a completely sensible idea like developer impact fees are not going forward?,348,,
952,0.97,6773.633,6775.602,The reality is it's all political.,348,,
953,0.97,6775.602,6796.89,"They are hated by corporate developers, not surprisingly, and that is why you see the inaction on the city council in the absence of a real campaign, a really momentum on the ground to push for it like the Amazon and like $15 an hour, and like the Renters that have won this year.",348,,
954,0.97,6796.89,6799.959,It's because we built independent campaigns to win them.,348,,
955,0.97,6799.959,6812.338,So the overall result is years have gone by and corporate developers continue to make double-digit rates without paying anything resembling their fair share in taxes.,348,,
956,0.97,6812.338,6837.297,"And you can see developers, contracts with banks, big corporations all of whom are making big bucks from construction and development, they are also the entity responsible for denying basic contracts to construction workers and we are seeing courageous Union carpenters on strike.",348,,
957,0.97,6837.297,6840.133,And so all of this is in the mixture.,348,,
958,0.97,6840.133,6847.907,I voted yes on the previous agenda item changing the name of single family zones to neighborhood residential but let's make it clear.,348,,
959,0.97,6847.907,6851.978,It's nothing more than a name change having absolutely no material impact.,348,,
960,0.97,6851.978,6862.222,This is where the--that is where the political establishment chose to put their impact.,348,,
961,0.97,6862.222,6879.472,"And they want to focus everyone on symbolic issues, and as I said before I will be voting yes on the comprehensive plan amendment because I do not object to those amendments in particular but I urge members of the public.",348,,
962,0.97,6879.472,6894.454,"If we want the developer impact fees, if you want the developers to pay anything to their fair share and expand the transit hours in Seattle, we need to --",348,,
963,0.97,6894.454,6895.388,"Councilmember, point of order.",349,,
964,0.97,6895.388,6895.722,Thank you.,350,,

968,0.97,6905.498,6925.618,"Again, colleagues, our city council rules require us to keep your comments focused on the Legislaturive matter that is being debated as opposed to generalized comments about unrelated legislative matters.",351,,
969,0.97,6925.618,6940.466,So I would appreciate your help in staying true to the requirements of the city council rule to make sure that we are staying efficient and --,351,,
970,0.97,6940.466,6955.848,"But Council President Gonzalez, all of my comments were 100 percent related to the plan.",352,,
971,0.97,6955.848,6973.599,"Councilmember Sawant, I am for the record agreeing that all of your comments were 100 percent related to the Council bill before us which in my understanding are routine amendments to the comprehensive plan in the works for a year.",353,,
972,0.97,6973.599,6984.21,"I agree that you would like to see them be more robust, and you have an interest in advancing the legislation that you just described but that's not the matter before us.",353,,
973,0.97,6984.21,6986.679,The matter before us is contained in the Council bill.,353,,
974,0.97,6986.679,7004.897,"Your objections are duly noted, and again, want to make sure that we are being efficient and effective in the time that we have together, and I am just asking for you all to work with me in being able to to achieve that.",353,,
975,0.97,7004.897,7006.199,Any additional comments on this bill?,353,,
976,0.97,7006.199,7009.702,I am not seeing any other hands raised.,353,,
977,0.97,7009.702,7014.107,"Councilmember Strauss, would you like to close it out?",353,,
978,0.97,7014.24,7021.948,"Thank you Council President, and just to respond to things that were said on the record a moment ago.",354,,
979,0.97,7021.948,7024.884,Understand impact fees were docketed and docketed for a number of years.,354,,
980,0.97,7024.884,7045.805,"Being docketed is a request to have the executive and executive Department study the issue at hand and not only that but Council put forward the resources and when I say study, that means to have Cepa conducted to the policy proposal.",354,,
981,0.97,7045.805,7059.352,"Furthermore, the city Council has put forward to have impact fees studied so there is no--we have made the request of the executive to have the fees conducted and put forward the resources to do so.",354,,
982,0.97,7059.352,7069.595,"This at time, we are waiting for it to be conclude before we amend the comprehensive plan to--to include impact fees.",354,,
