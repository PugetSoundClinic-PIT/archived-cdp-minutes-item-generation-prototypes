106,0.97,719.185,728.394,The center for American progress found that 28.6% of calls handled by SPD should be handled by them.,25,,
107,0.97,728.394,746.112,"Instead of working to transfer the calls, they insist on a third party analysis that has not materialized in demanding the 2022 budget including a $19 million Slush fund for positions it has no plans to hire this year.",25,,

118,0.97,791.19,795.06,The standard fare was low in 2016 and effectively cut with inflation.,30,,
119,0.97,795.06,805.671,Granted Uber has been providing us with an extra 35 cents for a trip to compensate for the inflating fuel prices but this is not enough.,30,,
120,0.97,805.671,821.587,"We need a real mileage cost, and that is basing the mileage on IRS rates and not the rates by Uber.",30,,

189,0.97,1346.812,1355.22,"Sometimes, I feel guilty with relying on the Apps, and I am concerned about how the companies treat the delivery workers.",43,,
190,0.97,1355.22,1360.892,I am angry that they are using me to make an argument for their financial benefit.,43,,

196,0.97,1380.579,1395.127,I am Ariana from district four and I'm calling on behalf on objecting to the hiring of SPD.,45,,
197,0.97,1395.127,1406.805,The analysis of the hiring program found that SPD did not experience an increase in hiring and it has a limited impact.,45,,
198,0.97,1406.805,1411.176,The city ran a bonus hiring program that was never analyzed.,45,,
199,0.97,1411.176,1429.461,"Spd was supposed to provide the Council a final report of the program, and it's fiscally irresponsible to do another before analyzing the program.",45,,

208,0.97,1485.116,1494.759,A large share of pet work is in the Apps making it harder for the workers to get work elsewhere.,47,,
209,0.97,1494.759,1501.099,The gig Apps have market dominant positions and the effects need to be regulated to reasonable fees.,47,,

235,0.97,1634.466,1638.77,Bonuses reward and further increase police violence and nothing to increase public safety.,53,,
236,0.97,1638.77,1641.973,"In fact, they make us all left save.",53,,

239,0.97,1662.861,1663.194,It's simple.,53,,
240,0.97,1663.194,1670.769,We don't need hiring bonuses because the absolute last thing this city needs is more cops.,53,,

292,0.97,1981.346,1999.197,I worked all the Apps and found that the division in the marketplace would serve a disservice.,63,,
293,0.97,1999.197,2010.708,"One, it would undermine the service, one service overly populated and another would be almost neglected but what is my concern is we are talking about this in 2022.",63,,

302,0.97,2072.67,2088.052,This is a well-intentioned effort to help the delivery drivers to have a rise in cost of living but it will lead to higher costs for Seattle families and fewer orders for drivers and gig workers.,65,,
303,0.97,2088.052,2117.148,"We all want to see livable wages for Seattle, but the grocery delivery and dog walking will see higher increases, and this will have an impact on our most vulnerable population.",65,,

321,0.97,2234.999,2247.545,Is passing pay up would Vance racial equity and put money in community businesses and give the gig workers the basic rights every worker needs.,69,,

508,0.97,3636.899,3638.735,He can't afford to do both.,108,,
509,0.97,3638.735,3650.713,And another shop owner on Capitol Hill was the victim of three thefts this month.,108,,
510,0.97,3650.713,3655.184,And this criminal activity can't be ignored.,108,,
511,0.97,3655.184,3661.624,"When I took office, we have 5000 cases that we are calling the backlog.",108,,
512,0.97,3661.624,3664.127,I want to stress this is unusual.,108,,
513,0.97,3664.127,3673.269,"It's unlikely that a city like Seattle would not have a backlog, 5000 is unusual.",108,,
514,0.97,3673.269,3683.079,The average time is 334 days and the longest one has been waiting for a decision for two years.,108,,
515,0.97,3683.079,3691.421,It's unacceptable to wait two years to determine if a person will be charged with a crime.,108,,
516,0.97,3691.421,3696.459,We have a plan to clear the backlog and move forward.,108,,
517,0.97,3696.459,3709.138,"We are using the resources on the current Rereferral and because of that, my recovers will be declining nearly 2000.",108,,
518,0.97,3709.138,3723.553,I want to reinforce we are making this decision because this is the only way that you can begin to returned Realtime accountability to the misdemeanor criminal justice system.,108,,
519,0.97,3723.553,3725.288,Justice delayed is justice denied.,108,,
520,0.97,3725.288,3727.59,"The long tear goes, the harder to Prosecutor.",108,,
521,0.97,3727.59,3743.172,"And we will move forward and remove a majority of cases that will likely take to the end of the years to complete, and I will be asking for temporary resources and a supplement budget to help us to finish this work.",108,,
522,0.97,3743.172,3763.593,"I would like to that over to my criminal chief Natalie Walton- Anderson, an experienced Prosecutor and is a welcomed leader in the city attorney's office.",108,,
523,0.97,3763.593,3766.496,"Natalie, I'll hand it to you.",108,,
524,0.97,3766.496,3775.371,"Good morning and thank you, Ann.",109,,
525,0.97,3775.371,3778.708,"Good morning, Councilmembers and professional staff partners that helped to host us.",109,,
526,0.97,3778.708,3790.052,"My name is Natalie Walton- Anderson and I was asked by an Davison, the criminal natural chief, and I was born here in Seattle.",109,,
527,0.97,3790.052,3806.736,"To start, I would like to give a general overview of the city's plans to address the backlog as the city attorney has indicated, the new administration given a backlog of nearly 5000 referrals.",109,,
528,0.97,3806.736,3813.509,The criminal attorneys will review 300 referrals a month.,109,,
529,0.97,3813.509,3824.72,"Due to the staffing, our officers will have to decline 1921 referrals with the average referral having sat in the backlog for 334 days.",109,,
530,0.97,3824.72,3831.227,"Through the administration's policy changes, we have already reduced the backlog by almost 550 cases.",109,,
531,0.97,3831.227,3838.301,May I see the top of the first slide.,109,,
532,0.97,3838.301,3845.808,So this first slide is important to show the historical back ground of the numbers for the Seattle police Department.,109,,
533,0.97,3845.808,3854.717,"As you can see, the be number of referrals dropped off significantly in 2020 and began rising again in 2021.",109,,
534,0.97,3854.717,3866.729,"The referrals numbers increased after quarter one, and I would anticipate that quarter one and quarter three be higher than based on the historical data than presented.",109,,
535,0.97,3866.729,3872.735,"If I may have the slides, please.",109,,
536,0.97,3872.735,3882.111,This chart shows the steady growth of the Seattle police Department referrals that make up the backlog from 2019 through today.,109,,
537,0.97,3882.111,3884.847,It may be hard to see.,109,,
538,0.97,3884.847,3891.621,This chart is wanting to shot depth in terms of years and months.,109,,
539,0.97,3891.621,3900.763,But we have already begun to reduce the rest thanks to the close and review policy.,109,,
540,0.97,3900.763,3902.732,Next slide.,109,,
541,0.97,3902.732,3911.307,"As city attorney Davison mentioned in her opening remarks, Misdemeanors often serious.",109,,
542,0.97,3911.307,3923.819,We have 971 domestic violence referrals sitting in the backlog waiting to review and 900 assault referrals waiting and these charges are not insignificant.,109,,
543,0.97,3923.819,3934.196,You can see the close in time review policy that started in February of this year that have had on this time with the following referrals from the Seattle police.,109,,
544,0.97,3934.196,3939.402,It's important to note that there are still referrals in the backlog from 2020 and 2021.,109,,
545,0.97,3939.402,3947.41,So those calling for 2020 and 2021 full transparency will continue to rise.,109,,
546,0.97,3947.41,3959.622,Box--146 and 122 will continue to rise until we complete the backlog.,109,,
547,0.97,3959.622,3983.179,"But in 2022, the green column, from January 21 to this week t has taken 90 days to close those cases and we will continue to average 19.",109,,
548,0.97,3983.179,3984.413,Next slide.,109,,
549,0.97,3984.413,3986.215,Here is the backlog priority area.,109,,
550,0.97,3986.215,3995.624,"As you can see, we are addressing the backlog by Prioritizing.",109,,
551,0.97,3995.624,4003.466,We must decline the criminal Tres mass and Non- Dui traffic offenses.,109,,
552,0.97,4003.466,4015.578,The cases have to be declined because we cannot take action on the cases that have passed the statute of limitations.,109,,
553,0.97,4015.578,4035.03,"All crimes against persons, firearms or Duis are priority, and at this point we wanted to make sure we had time for questions.",109,,
554,0.97,4035.03,4038.868,Thank you so much.,110,,
555,0.97,4038.868,4040.269,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for hosting us.",111,,
556,0.97,4040.269,4040.603,Thank you.,112,,
557,0.97,4040.603,4053.716,Can you take the presentation down so I can see everybody and see if we have any questions?,112,,
558,0.97,4053.716,4054.85,Councilmember Pedersen?,113,,
559,0.97,4054.984,4074.003,I wanted to thank the city attorney and the chief for being here today and going through this data and coming up with a plan on how to reduce the backlog going forward.,114,,
560,0.97,4074.003,4074.97,Thank you.,114,,
561,0.97,4074.97,4075.337,Absolutely.,115,,
562,0.97,4075.337,4080.91,Any other questions from Councilmembers or comments?,116,,
563,0.97,4080.91,4081.377,Councilmember Lewis?,116,,
564,0.97,4081.51,4083.279,"Thank you, Madam chair.",117,,
565,0.97,4083.279,4110.739,"Similarly, I want to extend my gratitude that Councilmember Pedersen had for not only tackling the backlog but a backlog that sort of asserted itself in the last five to six years on a consistent bases and appreciate the Proactiveness in coming up with a plan.",117,,
566,0.97,4110.739,4115.144,I want to go back to the fourth slide if possible if that can be put up.,117,,
567,0.97,4115.144,4129.358,I don't know if this would be a question that would be better for city attorney Davison or Miss Walton-Anderson.,117,,
568,0.97,4129.358,4163.392,"But in terms of the outstanding cases in the backlog that are indicated on slide four, there is a fairly significant number of trespass referrals that could be 180 eligible, my question would be to what extent might be the referral be a component of resolving the backlog.",117,,
569,0.97,4163.392,4179.508,"It would not resolve the entire backlog but a number of cases resolved, and I wonder if we could get an update on the extent to that strategy to move through these cases.",117,,
570,0.97,4179.508,4182.945,"Ann, would you like to take that question?",118,,
571,0.97,4183.078,4184.28,That would be great.,119,,
572,0.97,4184.28,4187.182,Thank you.,119,,
573,0.97,4187.182,4190.719,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",119,,
574,0.97,4190.719,4203.532,With regard that is a fantastic partner for the Seattle city attorney's office and the idea is to utilize the Prefiling program for the current cases coming in.,119,,
575,0.97,4203.532,4208.704,"Unfortunately to review those Cses to see if they are eligible, we have to comb through them.",119,,
576,0.97,4208.704,4231.594,"We have two prosecutors and are hoping to fill Obviously, the Pre-Filing positions that Council has granted us, but it takes time to have comb through the referrals and make sure that they can be eligible for the program and we are choosing to utilize the cases that are coming in, the property and theft cases to engage with 180.",119,,
577,0.97,4231.594,4251.447,So none of the cases in the backlog are eligible or that will be sort of a Triaging process going forward to determine if--like if a filing deputy finds something eligible to go into that category.,120,,
578,0.97,4251.447,4258.954,Like it could go in there or the policy is these cases can't be diverted?,120,,
579,0.97,4259.088,4263.525,It's being made a policy decision to decline these 2000 cases.,121,,
580,0.97,4263.525,4267.963,It doesn't mean that we aren't referring cases to 180.,121,,
581,0.97,4267.963,4272.101,We are choosing to do that Realtime with the cases that Arecoming in.,121,,
582,0.97,4272.101,4294.79,"In order to go back and divert the cases that were declined based on the time that has gone by and the amount of resources we don't have, we are moving forward to the cases in time so the effort would be more--more appropriately used for the cases currently coming in.",121,,
583,0.97,4294.923,4295.157,Okay.,122,,
584,0.97,4295.157,4298.994,I will follow up Offline on that.,122,,
585,0.97,4298.994,4309.471,"I think I understand the plan going forward, but I appreciate the clarification.",122,,
586,0.97,4309.471,4310.706,I think it was slide six.,122,,
587,0.97,4310.706,4314.576,Can we just stay on this slide real quickly?,123,,
588,0.97,4314.71,4315.244,Sure.,124,,
589,0.97,4315.244,4338.2,"Can we just clarify on the slide, the cases in the categories of property destruction, Harassment, trespass are among the cases that are declining to prosecute in addition to about another 400 cases that you can't prosecute because of the statute of limitations?",125,,
590,0.97,4338.2,4339.268,Is that correct?,125,,
591,0.97,4339.401,4341.003,"Councilmember Herbold, thank you.",126,,
592,0.97,4341.003,4351.246,"Just for clarification, we would count domestic violence, assault, Dui and Harassment and weapons charges as cases that are most serious that we are reviewing.",126,,
593,0.97,4351.246,4363.759,"The cases that we are declining are theft, property destruction and trespass and Non-Dui traffic.",126,,
594,0.97,4363.759,4364.56,Very helpful.,127,,
595,0.97,4364.56,4365.027,Thank you very much.,127,,
596,0.97,4365.027,4390.686,And while we're on that point to just categorically decline the theft and Trespassing or was there any triage of those cases for other factors that might make them more serious and put them into the 3000 or so cases considered?,128,,
597,0.97,4390.686,4394.089,I would be good to clarify that as well.,128,,
598,0.97,4394.089,4394.923,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",129,,
599,0.97,4394.923,4395.124,Yes.,129,,
600,0.97,4395.124,4411.24,What we did with the cases that we typically from the policy standard decline we looked at the individuals that would be meet the high Utilizer criteria or have three or more in the backlog.,129,,
601,0.97,4411.24,4429.091,"If that's the case, we would pull those out because there is consistent contact with law enforcement, and they have several in the backlog Cue and we pulled them out to be added to the Prioritization to be reviewed.",129,,
602,0.97,4429.091,4433.429,Some of the property destruction cases are also getting declined.,130,,
603,0.97,4433.429,4448.11,Was there any Triaging to those in terms of it is nature of the property destruction?,130,,
604,0.97,4448.11,4471.767,I am asking these at the same time and the crime against property destruction--some of the property destruction fact patterns can be obviously pretty concerning particular Ly in the case where is it's the person's personal property.,130,,
605,0.97,4471.767,4491.553,"And under any circumstances, it's concerning but I wonder any triage for certain property destruction fact patterns where there was a Provable case, particularly against personal property.",130,,
606,0.97,4491.553,4495.224,And just wondering if some of those are getting declined.,130,,
607,0.97,4495.224,4501.33,"Councilmember Lewis, thank you again for the question, and these are incredibly tough cases.",131,,
608,0.97,4501.33,4519.915,"A lot of us have spent a lot of time, especially the one sole victim advocate handling hundreds if not thousands of requests from victims who are property owners and small business victims.",131,,
609,0.97,4519.915,4526.788,And it's very difficult to decline the cases in terms of the criteria of breaking those out.,131,,
610,0.97,4526.788,4535.23,We have identified the high Utilizer criteria and those individuals with three or more in the backlog.,131,,
611,0.97,4535.23,4543.205,"And with the property damage or the ability to review, we would love to have the resources to not decline.",131,,
612,0.97,4543.205,4562.024,"Unfortunately, we have been incredibly short staffed and we have a limited number of filing deputies, and we are asking for an all hand on deck approach, asking everyone, including myself, to review cases to minimize the amount of cases that we are trying to decline.",131,,
613,0.97,4562.024,4567.629,I would like to add to what Natalie has said.,132,,
614,0.97,4567.629,4568.063,Excuse me.,132,,
615,0.97,4568.063,4574.77,"Again, pardon my voice.",132,,
616,0.97,4574.77,4591.954,"It's--it's an extremely difficult decision we have had to make but to restore Realtime accountability for today's property destruction and for those sets of cases, and we have to do this for that backlog.",132,,
617,0.97,4591.954,4594.089,This is a historic look back.,132,,
618,0.97,4594.089,4599.027,"This is not going forward, and we want to make sure that people understand the distinction.",132,,
619,0.97,4599.027,4604.9,This is a case for an average of 334 days.,132,,
620,0.97,4604.9,4610.906,We will--we are not helping today's issues as well.,132,,
621,0.97,4610.906,4615.243,So we have had to create that Prioritization level.,132,,
622,0.97,4615.243,4617.779,Natalie and her team have done excellent in this hard task.,132,,
623,0.97,4617.779,4623.352,So I just want to say thank you probably to her and her team.,132,,
624,0.97,4623.352,4624.419,Thanks so much.,133,,
625,0.97,4624.419,4639.368,Just want to again flag that both myself and Councilmember Lewis spent several questions probably a week ago.,133,,
626,0.97,4639.368,4716.078,"I sent mine left night, about four, five questions about the backlog and focused on the impacts of the contract and Mou commitment to maintain the average, and the backlog of cases and prosecution and the officers and public defender's case assignment, so most of my questions about the backlog was about that, and I have four questions about the initiative and one question that I intended to send and I cannot and I will flag here now is related to--I did include a question about how you intend to work with the high Utilizers but a question I failed to include is how you will handle the class members that--treating them as high utilize cases, not conflicting with the cases.",133,,
627,0.97,4716.078,4718.78,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",134,,
628,0.97,4718.78,4723.051,We look forward to answering those questions outside of the setting.,134,,
629,0.97,4723.051,4724.886,Thank you for sending those over.,134,,
630,0.97,4724.886,4733.829,And I am not seeing any other hand raised.,135,,
631,0.97,4733.829,4735.297,Thank you again for being with us.,135,,
632,0.97,4735.297,4735.564,Sorry.,136,,
633,0.97,4735.564,4736.064,"Oh, sorry.",137,,
634,0.97,4736.064,4736.798,Sorry.,138,,
635,0.97,4736.798,4737.399,I had one.,138,,
636,0.97,4737.399,4741.503,It's a clarifying question.,138,,
637,0.97,4741.636,4742.904,Councilmember Lewis.,139,,
638,0.97,4742.904,4747.676,"Earlier, there were comments about the office not being fully staffed.",140,,
639,0.97,4747.676,4755.751,I thought we had seen in the earlier announcements that the open criminal victim positions had been filled.,140,,
640,0.97,4755.751,4763.825,Was that just a comment on the new hires still being Onboarded because it was fairly recent?,140,,
641,0.97,4763.825,4771.199,Where is the office in terms of being fully staffed within the resources currently appropriated?,140,,
642,0.97,4771.333,4772.267,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",141,,
643,0.97,4772.267,4772.434,Ys.,141,,
644,0.97,4772.434,4781.977,We are still having people on board and we have somebody starting this week and we have one more position at least left to fill.,141,,
645,0.97,4781.977,4784.946,We have had at least six people start.,141,,
646,0.97,4784.946,4795.991,"My start date was March 1 and they are due this month, and the process of Onboarding the individuals to be fully up to speed takes some time.",141,,
647,0.97,4795.991,4798.326,How many outstanding vacancies are there?,142,,
648,0.97,4798.46,4815.577,We have one more outstanding vacancy for the criminal decision and again I believe we have several positions open for the Prefiling that the Council has granted as well that we have not filled yet.,143,,
649,0.97,4815.577,4816.711,Thank you.,144,,
650,0.97,4816.711,4817.345,All right.,145,,
651,0.97,4817.345,4817.679,Thanks again.,145,,
652,0.97,4817.679,4821.85,"No further question or comments, we will close out this topic.",145,,
653,0.97,4821.85,4823.285,"I'm sorry, Councilmember.",146,,
654,0.97,4823.285,4826.788,There is one more hand up.,146,,
655,0.97,4826.922,4829.09,I am so sorry.,147,,
656,0.97,4829.09,4829.658,Councilmember Nelson.,147,,
657,0.97,4829.658,4831.293,It's okay.,148,,
658,0.97,4831.293,4835.463,Thank you very much for this information and also for the Proactive work that you are doing.,148,,
659,0.97,4835.463,4846.975,"I have questions that I will ask Offline, but to me, this is one part of the chain of our public safety processes.",148,,

672,0.97,4906.835,4907.235,Let's move on.,153,,
673,0.97,4907.235,4915.844,Will the clerk please read in agenda item number three.,153,,
674,0.97,4915.844,4927.422,"Spd staffing update, discussion of resolution 32050 and citywide hiring incentives for hard to fill positions.",154,,
675,0.97,4927.422,4928.79,All right.,155,,
676,0.97,4928.79,4943.338,We are joined by Greg Doss the central staff and chief Diaz and Brian Maxey Yeah and Mike fields from SPD.,155,,
677,0.97,4943.338,4955.483,"We will not be voting, but we will start with Greg Doss on the first quarter sworn staffing report as requested by the council as part of the 2022 budget.",155,,
678,0.97,4955.483,4964.025,"After that, we will move to Councilmember Nelson's proposed resolution and to the draft Council bill that I've sponsored.",155,,
679,0.97,4964.025,4964.793,Please proceed.,155,,
680,0.97,4964.793,4967.228,"Thank you, Madam chair.",156,,
681,0.97,4967.228,4985.947,"Members of the tie, city, Councilmembers, I am Greg Doss to talk about the staffing resolution, 32050, Councilmember Nelson's resolution on staffing and I will start with the sworn staffing report.",156,,
682,0.97,4985.947,5006.167,"Before I dive into it, I have to thank SPD for all the help that they have provided over the last week and a half, providing the data information and staffing report for the central staff memo that is posted on line that I'll be talking about this morning.",156,,
683,0.97,5006.167,5010.205,They always provide so much data and are so helpful.,156,,
684,0.97,5010.205,5018.213,"They make central staff look good but the information coming from them, and I have to acknowledge that and thank the staff.",156,,
685,0.97,5018.213,5020.915,"So with that, I will dive right in.",156,,
686,0.97,5020.915,5024.953,So we last talked in January about the year-end sworn staffing.,156,,
687,0.97,5024.953,5036.664,"This is going to be the Q1, so this is going to cover the updates between January and March and show how staffing has progressed.",156,,
688,0.97,5036.664,5038.099,"Allie, thank you.",156,,
689,0.97,5038.099,5052.981,"And that's--this is the same chart that you have seen before, and as you can see, the Actuals between January and March are not looking very good.",156,,
690,0.97,5052.981,5058.219,The actual separations are 43 and the actual hires were 13.,156,,
691,0.97,5058.219,5064.059,And that is quite a bit off from what SPD was originally expecting.,156,,
692,0.97,5064.059,5071.166,Spd was originally expecting to get about--they were--they got about 27 fewer hires.,156,,
693,0.97,5071.166,5073.101,They were expecting to get 40.,156,,
694,0.97,5073.101,5079.407,"And they got 13, and they got about 19 more separations.",156,,
695,0.97,5079.407,5083.411,They were expecting 24 and got 43.,156,,
696,0.97,5083.411,5087.849,So the hires and separations went very much the other way from what the Department was hoping.,156,,
697,0.97,5087.849,5109.204,"In terms of how that works out annually, when you project out the end of the year, council central staff and myself working within the budget are predicting there will be 125 separations.",156,,
698,0.97,5109.204,5119.714,"However, the SPD Reviseds it own projections and is projecting at least 113 projections or 113 separations.",156,,
699,0.97,5119.714,5123.585,So SPD is predicting more separations as well.,156,,
700,0.97,5123.585,5129.057,And SPD has revised the hiring projections down to 98.,156,,
701,0.97,5129.057,5131.259,They had been hoping to get 125 hires.,156,,
702,0.97,5131.259,5142.403,"As it turns out, they are going to be getting only 98, they think so far based on the information that they got in this first quarter.",156,,
703,0.97,5142.403,5144.372,So how does that pan out throughout the year?,156,,
704,0.97,5144.372,5155.416,"If you look at the rest of the year, what we see is that at the end of the year, there will be--Allie, go ahead and flip it.",156,,
705,0.97,5155.416,5155.75,That's fine.,156,,
706,0.97,5155.75,5156.718,Thanks.,156,,
707,0.97,5156.718,5177.906,"At the end of the year, we will see that the number of fully trained officers we had expected when the 2022 budget was written there would be 1145 trained officers and there would be approximately 147 deployable officers.",156,,
708,0.97,5177.906,5192.453,What we are going to find is there are going to be 1103 fully trained officers and 1011 deployable officers.,156,,
709,0.97,5192.453,5203.231,"You can see the difference between what we expected in the original budget assumptions for the 2022 budget and what we are projecting now, based on the latest forecast.",156,,
710,0.97,5203.231,5210.772,We are down in fully trained officers by 42 and down officers in service by 36.,156,,
711,0.97,5210.772,5235.363,"The reason the officers in service number is a little bit lower, some of the officers in service that have been out, again, this is a column that reflects folks that are out on long-term leave, folks that are out on family leave or disability or other kinds of leave or not deployable, some of those folks are coming back.",156,,
712,0.97,5235.363,5254.782,"So that's good news, and so that means that the officers in service number is not taking quite as big a hit as the fully trained officers number.",156,,
713,0.97,5254.782,5267.161,But this number is the number that the Department calculates the sworn officer savings will be off by 32.,156,,
714,0.97,5267.462,5287.649,I put in between $4.1 million and $4.5 million.,157,,
715,0.97,5287.649,5301.663,You heard me say earlier that SPD is projecting 113 separations and 98 Hiers and that the Council had projected its budget of 125 separations.,157,,
716,0.97,5301.663,5316.711,"It sort of depends on which assumption you take . If you take the Council assumption of 125 separations, you get the hire number of 4.5 million.",157,,
717,0.97,5316.711,5324.619,"If you take SPD's assumption of 113 separations, you get the lower number of 4.1 million.",157,,
718,0.97,5324.619,5329.09,"Either way, obviously the trend is not particularly good.",157,,
719,0.97,5329.09,5355.45,"Both of the--on the hiring side, SPD and central staff are both using the same numbers that we are assuming that they are going to have 98 hires made up of 80 recruit hires, 17 letters and one Rehire . with that, I will stop and ask if there is any questions on the big picture.",157,,
720,0.97,5355.45,5356.517,Okay.,157,,
721,0.97,5356.517,5359.787,Go ahead and flip again.,157,,
722,0.97,5359.787,5362.957,I think we have flipped one too far.,157,,
723,0.97,5362.957,5365.259,There we go.,157,,
724,0.97,5365.259,5368.296,Going to how this rolls out into the precinct staffing.,157,,
725,0.97,5368.296,5371.232,There is a bit of a change around in the precinct staffing.,157,,
726,0.97,5371.232,5411.405,The citywide category to the far left is the community response unit . This is the unit that the chief stood up a little over a year ago that consists of more experience for officers that have transferred into 911 to be able to assist with keeping response times low . What has happened here is that this unit has been basically cut in half . We saw 54 officers and I believe nine sergeants last time around.,157,,
727,0.97,5411.405,5421.749,"Now, that unit is not nearly as big but the precincts themselves have more officers growing in them.",157,,
728,0.97,5421.749,5433.528,I want to make clear that that does not necessarily mean that there is more strength in the precincts.,157,,
729,0.97,5433.528,5440.234,"Overall, the precinct staffing for all of the precincts including the citywide, has gone down by four officers.",157,,
730,0.97,5440.234,5448.81,"Really, this is a Reshuffling of the deck . The citywide response unit had been responding from the precincts.",157,,
731,0.97,5448.81,5470.832,"The fact that they have now been decentralized amongst the precincts, or are amongst the precincts along the way, it does not make a lot of difference from an overall ability for SPD to respond to 911 calls.",157,,
732,0.97,5470.832,5500.228,"The chief can talk a little bit more about that when he speaks but I wanted to make sure everyone understood that if we are looking just particularly at North and you see that North has nine fewer officers than it did the last time around, you should also know that some of the citywide response officers had been working in the North precinct and that that number is now down.",157,,
733,0.97,5500.228,5508.202,The officers had been moved around and it is difficult to draw conclusions from this report.,157,,
734,0.97,5508.202,5513.708,I may now ask the chief if he wants to comment on that.,157,,
735,0.97,5513.708,5515.543,I think my comments are more confusing than anything.,157,,
736,0.97,5515.543,5517.578,Thank you.,158,,
737,0.97,5517.578,5518.579,That would be great.,159,,
738,0.97,5518.579,5527.788,"If you could maybe speak a little bit generally to how deployment decisions are made to the precinct, that would be helpful.",159,,
739,0.97,5527.788,5531.993,Thank you chair Herbold and the public safety & amp; human services Commission.,160,,
740,0.97,5531.993,5538.266,One of the things that is noted is that some see Argie went back to patrol.,160,,
741,0.97,5538.266,5548.276,The reason why we sent them back to patrol his there were several precincts that were Understaffed.,160,,
742,0.97,5548.276,5557.785,It moves up the staffing level 99.7% of all of our ships augmented . Our whole level of patrol is pretty much working some level of overtime.,160,,
743,0.97,5557.785,5564.025,I needed to make sure that we are trying to levy some of that up.,160,,
744,0.97,5564.025,5577.738,Our CRG is smaller . the community response group is allowing us to have some level of productivity.,160,,
745,0.97,5577.738,5584.445,"They are addressing gun violence, shots fired, evening events that we know could potentially result in some level of violence.",160,,
746,0.97,5584.445,5587.949,Having a smaller group be able to do that does not make it easier.,160,,
747,0.97,5587.949,5592.987,We are covering more and more guns.,160,,
748,0.97,5592.987,5605.433,It is a little bit of shuffling the deck but I am getting less officers to be able to be a little more Proactive in some of the Long-Standing work that needs to be done as well on the streets.,160,,
749,0.97,5605.433,5610.705,Thank you for that clarification.,161,,
750,0.97,5610.705,5614.976,"Last slide, please.",161,,
751,0.97,5614.976,5618.245,This is just a comparison of how patrol and 911 response looks overtime.,162,,
752,0.97,5618.245,5641.836,"As you can see here, when compared with highest point in recent history, September 2020, patrol is still down quite a ways . The 911 responders are down by 130 since December 2020.",162,,
753,0.97,5641.836,5649.977,It looks like the patrol itself was that the strength of 694 and now it is down to 545.,162,,
754,0.97,5649.977,5674.168,A considerable loss there . a lot of it is dealing with--a lot of that reflect's the fact that the beats are now significantly reduced and the specialty units such as the community police teams and the prime response teams are now gone.,162,,
755,0.97,5674.168,5682.043,It is really back to basics with patrol with the focus on 911 response.,162,,
756,0.97,5682.043,5686.547,That is the staffing report.,162,,
757,0.97,5686.547,5695.656,"I am now ready to jump into the staff report memo on the resolution . before that, Councilmember Nelson--I'm sorry.",162,,
758,0.97,5695.656,5700.127,Questions for the chair?,162,,
759,0.97,5700.127,5700.795,Councilmember Nelson?,163,,
760,0.97,5700.795,5702.563,Thank you.,164,,
761,0.97,5702.563,5727.588,"Could you go back to the slide where the two lines show the trends in staffing . I am not a math wizard but I am looking at the bottom line . for me, what is most important is how many officers are available to prevent, fight, and investigate crime.",164,,
762,0.97,5727.588,5739.567,"From 1290 down to 968, does that represent about a 33% reduction in force? I could very well be wrong.",164,,
763,0.97,5739.567,5771.632,"I just want to make--preview the discussion about the resolution because it is that number that is important because we are talking about available officers to be out there, responding to 911 but also investigating the crimes that we are most concerned about like guns, guns, et cetera that is leading to those 911 calls when we are talking about lower level crimes.",164,,
764,0.97,5771.632,5786.48,"That is my point and my question . I recognize the difference between those two numbers, the number above, 1114 and below it says 968.",164,,
765,0.97,5786.48,5799.693,We talk about leave . I think about 114 people are on leave and it is great news that they are coming back but a lot of the people on leave are planning on leaving the Department for various reasons.,164,,
766,0.97,5799.693,5811.071,They are using up sick and vacation time before they separate . Thank you.,164,,
767,0.97,5811.071,5814.308,"Thank you, Councilmember.",165,,
768,0.97,5814.308,5815.242,That is absolutely true.,165,,
769,0.97,5815.242,5831.559,"There is, in the staff report, a breakout--a category go breakout of the people who are out on leave . As you know, that is the difference between at 1114 number and the 968 number.",165,,
770,0.97,5831.559,5869.43,"As you noted, there are folks that are using sick accrued leave, 75 of them are on sick accrued leave . There are about 19 that are on family medical leave, seven that are on parental leave and 16 that are on administrative leave . about 26 on workers COMP . You are right that about half of them or so are on the kind of leave that they might take before they separate from the Department and that is often a good indicator of a future separation.",165,,
771,0.97,5869.43,5871.999,Those folks are not deployable now.,165,,
772,0.97,5871.999,5886.213,It is an indicator of Street strength and ultimately it could be that those folks never return where half of them may not.,165,,
773,0.97,5886.213,5911.071,I thought I heard you say that there was a positive trend on the issue of officers on extended leave . I have a note here that the number of officers on disability or extended leave increased 108 to 176 from September to October of last year after the announcement of the vaccine mandate.,166,,
774,0.97,5911.071,5921.949,"I am wondering, where can I see that trend of some of those officers coming back to work?",166,,
775,0.97,5921.949,5947.241,"The positive trend is the difference between the year end number that I gave you in the January report . There were 170 officers that were out on leave at that time . in quarter one, the report I'm giving you now, there are 146 that are out on leave . I am trying to think of the math.",167,,
776,0.97,5947.241,5965.659,"There is 24 that is primarily due to--it looks like a reduction of 10 in accrued leave benefits, 10 in family medical leave and then a few others here in worker's COMP .'s and parental leave.",167,,
777,0.97,5965.659,5970.931,Thank you.,168,,
778,0.97,5970.931,5971.598,Councilmember Mosqueda?,169,,
779,0.97,5971.598,5973.167,"Thank you very much, Madam chair.",170,,
780,0.97,5973.167,5976.203,Thank you very much for that initial numbers.,170,,
781,0.97,5976.203,5979.84,I do have a question about the data set that was just on the slide.,170,,
782,0.97,5979.84,5981.642,If we can pop that presentation backup.,170,,
783,0.97,5981.642,5992.853,The data in today's presentation goes back to August of 2020 when SPD had the larger number of 911 responders due to Reassignment of 100 officers to 911.,170,,
784,0.97,5992.853,6026.587,"Therefore, making it that the data point as an Outlier compared to what we would have normally seen . As I look back at some of the presentations that have been provided before, in the March 9, 2021 presentation to Council, SPD STATA showed us if we look at the data going back to 2018 and we compare that to 2019 and we compare it even further to 2014, we see that traditionally, we have always had just over 500 officers in 911 response.",170,,
785,0.97,6026.587,6031.225,I will show you some numbers and I'm hoping that you can tell me if these are accurate or not this presentation.,170,,
786,0.97,6031.225,6042.202,"If I am looking at 2014, there was 545 officers.",170,,
787,0.97,6042.202,6043.237,"2016, 574 officers.",170,,
788,0.97,6043.237,6047.107,"2017, 572 officers.",170,,
789,0.97,6047.107,6048.075,"2018, 544 officers.",170,,
790,0.97,6048.075,6054.815,"2019, 542.",170,,
791,0.97,6054.815,6065.392,This does factor in to whether or not we are seeing an Outlier from the 2020 data versus the five years previous to that.,170,,
792,0.97,6065.392,6066.794,I would love your thoughts about that.,170,,
793,0.97,6066.794,6089.75,"I also want to note for our committee and members of the public as a reminder, the National Institute for criminal justice reform 2021 study found--somebody spoke about this at the University of Washington, the 2021 study found that 21% of all of our 911 calls which constitute 80% of the call volume could be responded to by an alternative Responder, not a sworn officer.",170,,
794,0.97,6089.75,6099.693,These findings echo what we saw from the center for American progress and the law enforcement action partnership which found that only 28.6% of colleges should actually be handled by a sworn officer.,170,,
795,0.97,6099.693,6110.671,"Spd has acknowledged this and has acknowledged that in this exact moment, 12% of the calls we are currently handling could be immediately transferred out of the Department.",170,,
796,0.97,6110.671,6122.249,"The conversation we are having today about whether or not we have the right size number of 911 officers is relevant, I just want to make sure we are looking back to the 2014 data that has been provided.",170,,
797,0.97,6122.249,6124.685,I saw consistency there.,170,,
798,0.97,6124.685,6142.97,"I am questioning whether or not we are being asked to do right now, in terms of evaluating the right number of officers for the call is being meshed up with a number of calls that we see from our own data analysis indicating that we don't need 911 officers.",170,,
799,0.97,6142.97,6146.006,"If we went with a conservative estimate, 12% would not need a 911 call.",170,,
800,0.97,6146.006,6165.926,"I would love to hear of whether or not those numbers are what you recall as well from 2014 and I want to make sure that as I say this, it is clear that I am Prioritizing that someone who needs an SPD officer is being freed up to respond that they are not getting deployed to these calls.",170,,
801,0.97,6165.926,6169.763,The data has shown they don't need a sworn officer with a gun.,170,,
802,0.97,6169.763,6172.833,"Can you flip to the next slide, please?",171,,
803,0.97,6172.833,6181.175,I want to make a point here that the 911 response is one part of the picture.,172,,
804,0.97,6181.175,6214.675,"The chief has moved many specialty unit officers from their specialty assignments into 911 so that we can have a consistent number of 911 responders because the chief has rightfully come with the staffing shortages, realized that Prioritizing 911 response, particularly the priority one calls is incredibly important to our community.",172,,
805,0.97,6214.675,6237.564,"What we are not seeing is the number of officers that have been moved off of their assignments, whether or not you are talking about elder abuse detectives, Cpt officers--there was a lot of officers--I don't have the current number.",172,,
806,0.97,6237.564,6246.139,There are a lot of officers that have been moved off of these specialty assignments in order to keep these numbers of 911 patrol up.,172,,
807,0.97,6246.139,6247.24,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,173,,
808,0.97,6247.24,6260.187,"While our patrol staffing has stayed relatively at the same level, we also had community Olicing teams, Anticrime teams that were Backfilling and supporting our 911 operation.",173,,
809,0.97,6260.187,6261.188,We no longer have that.,173,,
810,0.97,6261.188,6278.038,"We have had to have several of the detectives out of their unit and put them back into patrol . If we don't have an officer to respond to sexual assault, we will never have the follow-up to be able to investigate it.",173,,
811,0.97,6278.038,6291.752,"I have tried to make sure that we have maintained our patrol staffing levels but even as we look at some of the patrol staffing levels a year ago, over half of your force would be in patrol . We were under that.",173,,
812,0.97,6291.752,6299.159,"What we are also finding is that 99.7% of the time, we are augmenting the shift.",173,,
813,0.97,6299.159,6310.604,"That means that no matter what officers are having to work overtime just to handle the bare minimum, we are going to create wear and tear on our officers.",173,,
814,0.97,6310.604,6316.009,It creates a whole host of not being able to deal with our own internal trauma because we are constantly going from call to call to call.,173,,
815,0.97,6316.009,6332.893,"If I look at the three shifts, first, second and third watch, first and second watch are exceeding their amount of time answering 911 calls and not having what we call downtime to be able to do community work.",173,,
816,0.97,6332.893,6336.129,That right there creates huge levels of stress on us being able to respond properly.,173,,
817,0.97,6336.129,6344.871,Our priority one response time has gone up as well is our priority two call which has exceeded over 30 minutes.,173,,
818,0.97,6344.871,6348.108,Our priority three calls is almost over one hour.,173,,
819,0.97,6348.108,6357.884,"Even when people do need 911 services, we are not able to respond in the adequate amount of time.",173,,
820,0.97,6357.884,6361.354,"Councilmember Pedersen, I see you have your hand up there.",174,,
821,0.97,6361.354,6365.959,Can we move into the discussion of Council member Nelson's resolution?,174,,
822,0.97,6365.959,6373.3,I am sure your questions will lead into that.,174,,
823,0.97,6373.3,6374.735,I think that will be helpful.,175,,
824,0.97,6374.735,6378.672,"Some of the stuff that is coming up in discussion, I am about to go over in the resolution.",175,,
825,0.97,6378.672,6382.008,Would you mind putting up the first table in the staff memo?,175,,
826,0.97,6382.008,6389.783,Thank you.,175,,
827,0.97,6389.783,6395.455,I am going to go ahead and speak to the exact issue that the chair brought up and that the chief was talking about.,175,,
828,0.97,6395.455,6419.012,"When we talk about SPD staffing and we talk about maintaining response times and maintaining patrol numbers, the cost is that it is coming out of transfers that are being made from investigative units, specialty units and other units around the Department.",175,,
829,0.97,6419.012,6440.767,"This is just one Snapshot of how that looks since 2020, since the hiring or since the separation started . You can see here the account of the sworn in 2020 and the percent of the sworn in 2020 and the count of the percentage in 2022.",175,,
830,0.97,6440.767,6461.454,"If you take just a look at the investigative units here, which you can see is, there were 214 officers in investigative units in 2020. that is probably spread out amongst all kinds of investigative units, Homicide, investigative units, et cetera.",175,,
831,0.97,6461.454,6465.525,Now those numbers are down to 161 in investigative units.,175,,
832,0.97,6465.525,6472.833,"As a percentage of all sworn investigations, used to be 16% and now it is 14%.",175,,
833,0.97,6472.833,6482.609,One of the other areas that took a lather large reduction was in specialty units.,175,,
834,0.97,6482.609,6484.478,They used to be 119 officers and specialty units.,175,,
835,0.97,6484.478,6487.981,Here you have everything from harbor to K-9 to S.W.A.T ..,175,,
836,0.97,6487.981,6504.164,"Now, those officers are down to 33 or 3% of sworn . a lot of the officers that were in specialty units have been transferred into patrol to keep 911 response times as full as possible.",175,,
837,0.97,6504.164,6515.509,"This is the kind of impact that the chair was talking about, to keep 911 response times as best they can.",175,,
838,0.97,6515.509,6550.243,"The department has been willing officers into patrol and as the chief said, they are at a state now where it used to be that 51% of trained sworn officers were in Non-Patrol positions and now it is 48. that has been a rather sizable effect on the Department . Also, as the chief said, all of its community police teams have been disbanded . The Anticrime teams have been disbanded.",175,,
839,0.97,6550.243,6555.916,"The number of officers that are on foot and bike units, if you look back to 2020, there were about 55 and now there is four.",175,,
840,0.97,6555.916,6564.224,It is a pretty significant reduction everywhere else except for 911.,175,,
841,0.97,6564.224,6575.635,I am not going to go into--I had planned to go into 911 response times and into use of overtime to augment patrol staffing but the chief already did that.,175,,
842,0.97,6575.635,6581.675,Does this chart capture both transfers and separations?,176,,
843,0.97,6581.675,6593.286,"This is a Snapshot of what the Department looked like, how many people were in these units in 2020 and how many people are in these units now.",177,,
844,0.97,6593.286,6595.121,So the answer would be yes?,178,,
845,0.97,6595.121,6602.195,It includes both units of individuals being transferred to 911 as well as reduction from separation?,178,,
846,0.97,6602.195,6602.662,Yeah.,179,,
847,0.97,6602.662,6605.098,Thank you.,180,,
848,0.97,6605.098,6609.336,Councilmember Lewis?,181,,
849,0.97,6609.336,6609.936,Thank you.,182,,
850,0.97,6609.936,6641.034,"I have a question that I think goes a little bit to something Greg said he was going to address in more detail but to a certain extent, as we are looking at some of the immediate assignment of officers, if there is a chart somewhere reflecting the number of overtime shifts to augment in certain areas, I don't see it reflected in the charts.",182,,
851,0.97,6641.034,6651.177,"I am thinking specifically of things like the Hotspot focuses on third Avenue or in little Saigon, for example.",182,,
852,0.97,6651.177,6652.879,I understand a lot of that is overtime.,182,,
853,0.97,6652.879,6663.189,"I wonder where that is reflected in terms of total service hours, which might be distinct from the number of personnel, given how overtime is deployed.",182,,
854,0.97,6663.189,6667.06,The department does keep that data.,183,,
855,0.97,6667.06,6669.662,Thank you.,184,,
856,0.97,6669.662,6675.335,Going back to Councilmember Pedersen.,185,,
857,0.97,6675.335,6675.769,My apologies.,185,,
858,0.97,6675.769,6679.305,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",186,,
859,0.97,6679.305,6715.975,"I really appreciate this additional context behind the numbers because I am very alarmed at reduction of the number of officers as well as the difficulty in hiring new ones to simply replace some of the 375 that have left . I appreciate the additional context of the fact that even if we are keeping the number of 911 patrol officers relatively steady, as was mentioned--they are working overtime so it costs more.",186,,
860,0.97,6715.975,6725.251,Concerned about officer wellness and just how they are staying healthy and responding appropriately under that exhaustion.,186,,
861,0.97,6725.251,6737.297,"Then, detectives, community policing officers and other vital specialty units in the 911 patrol so that there is a reduction in investigation.",186,,
862,0.97,6737.297,6739.132,The community policing is not happening.,186,,
863,0.97,6739.132,6745.638,Another point is that Seattle's population has grown substantially since 2015.,186,,
864,0.97,6745.638,6753.146,I am very much looking forward to this discussion on hiring incentives.,186,,
865,0.97,6753.146,6756.416,I did want to ask about alternatives.,186,,
866,0.97,6756.416,6776.469,"I believe we are still awaiting some additional information from SPD on what type of calls could be handled by alternative responses but I guess the question for Greg is, do we have any of these alternative emergency responses ready to go today?",186,,
867,0.97,6776.469,6791.551,"The answer to that is no, the city does not have alternative responses for policing available today.",187,,
868,0.97,6791.551,6806.366,"The city has some kinds of behavioral and mental health response is available on the fireside with its help one program but on the policing side, those responses are not available yet.",187,,
869,0.97,6806.366,6848.007,"The executive is working on developing those responses and more specifically, as he is doing an analysis right now of the calls and trying to determine which calls could be answered by civilians per a request from this Committee, there is a response that is due in about four or five days, an update that the Department will be providing on its analysis for what type of calls might be responded to by civilians, a first step in that process . I believe that they are going to give--the chair is interested in scheduling a presentation.",187,,
870,0.97,6848.007,6850.41,Thank you.,188,,
871,0.97,6850.41,6873.166,"I am wondering--I see your hand up, council member Mosqueda, but I am wondering if we could allow Councilmember Nelson to describe her resolution or if she would prefer that central staff did so . We do not have a lot of discussion or debate but let's air them out.",188,,
872,0.97,6873.166,6878.271,Councilmember Nelson?,188,,
873,0.97,6878.271,6886.613,Let me first say that I welcome conversation and debate because this is the issue that has been dominating my time.,189,,
874,0.97,6886.613,6894.754,I hope that we can air questions and concerns with this resolution.,189,,
875,0.97,6894.754,6898.591,"First of all, let me thank you very much, chair, for hearing my resolution in your Committee.",189,,
876,0.97,6898.591,6914.04,"Fittingly, we are discussing it on the day that representative Walden joined us.",189,,
877,0.97,6914.04,6926.419,"She wrote a letter to Council in January, early February, basically calling on Council to hire more officers to address the increasing number of people in the black community that are dying from gun violence.",189,,
878,0.97,6926.419,6934.127,Just wanted to note that convergence because it was that letter that sent me down this path.,189,,
879,0.97,6934.127,6962.155,"Three months ago, I took an oath to uphold the Charter and protect the health and Well- being of my constituents . As economic of element chair, I set out with a whole bunch of policies for helping small businesses by responding to victims of violence and property crime has dominated my time.",189,,
880,0.97,6962.155,6972.532,That is why I invited a panel of small business owners to my committee to discuss the impacts on the businesses and workers and staff.,189,,
881,0.97,6972.532,6988.548,"That is a separate conversation but really, what drew me to put this forward, this resolution, 32050, was the fact that we are clearly dealing with a public safety emergency.",189,,
882,0.97,6988.548,7005.031,We don't have enough officers on the street to deal with it and we need to use every tool in our Toolbox to accelerate the hiring of our officers to bring up adequate staffing levels to SPD.,189,,
883,0.97,7005.031,7006.666,That is why I put this forward now.,189,,
884,0.97,7006.666,7010.336,This resolution does create--it begins that policy discussion.,189,,
885,0.97,7010.336,7019.212,It does three things . It States Council support for some sort of staffing incentive program.,189,,
886,0.97,7019.212,7061.12,"Then, it States the intent to provide those with influence last year on salary and unfit savings in SPD . Then, finally it States our intention to approve by separate ordinance whatever staffing changes comes forth from the executive to actually start this whole process of sweetening the deal so that we can begin this six month long process that it takes from application to actually getting hired by the police Department.",189,,
887,0.97,7061.12,7082.642,We have heard about the memo that perhaps these incentives do not work . We have made the point of looking at how many officers were hired after he two month long incentive program that was approved by executive order by Mayor Durkan.,189,,
888,0.97,7082.642,7101.36,"It is not a good metric for deciding whether or not the staffing incentives work . After all, every city in our region--every city except for Spokane--has some sort of staffing incentive program.",189,,
889,0.97,7101.36,7110.67,I have to assume that those jurisdictions are spending that money because they see a value of those incentives.,189,,
890,0.97,7110.67,7128.721,"I am calling for, in this resolution, not for new money but to use money already in SPD's 2022 budget will for some sort of staffing incentive program . We talk about it being relocation or hiring, whatever.",189,,
891,0.97,7128.721,7141.134,I trust the SPD and hr to develop a plan that will be most competitive to meet these needs.,189,,
892,0.97,7141.134,7143.97,We are not doing anything else.,189,,
893,0.97,7143.97,7153.145,"This is low hanging fruit to file need to put more officers on the street, to fight, prevent, and investigate crime.",189,,
894,0.97,7153.145,7166.459,We heard a lot of numbers today but the bigger picture is that people are dying . We have said we want to get guns off the street . Overdoses are skyrocketing.,189,,
895,0.97,7166.459,7183.242,"We need to target high-level drug dealing to investigate that, to keep more people from falling victim to addiction and Overdose . I am not even talking about all the cross city crimes I mentioned yesterday in briefing.",189,,
896,0.97,7183.242,7196.656,"Basically, this resolution will require additional Council bills to lift the bill and approve a staffing incentive program.",189,,
897,0.97,7196.656,7198.824,"Again, I come back to my point.",189,,
898,0.97,7198.824,7204.063,Are we happy with the status quo? are we fine not doing anything?,189,,
899,0.97,7204.063,7206.933,I am not.,189,,
900,0.97,7206.933,7222.982,"I am responding to the overwhelming support that the public and the people that: write to my office--the stories we hear on increasing crimes in all forms, that we are not able to address.",189,,
901,0.97,7222.982,7242.335,That is the basic crux of this piece of legislation . We start a policy conversation with the direction that I have just discussed.,189,,
902,0.97,7242.335,7244.737,"If we don't do this, what else are we going to do?",189,,
903,0.97,7244.737,7248.174,$4.1 million is a lot of money.,189,,
904,0.97,7248.174,7264.023,I don't know how else we would spend that and how good would that service to meet what I think is local government's first responsibility to ensure public safety.,189,,
905,0.97,7264.023,7268.995,"For me, everything else revolves around that, the ability to recover from our pandemic and a lot of our other policy goals.",189,,
906,0.97,7268.995,7280.273,"Year-to-date, per the most recent shots fired, Homicide events are up . We have only talked about the numbers officers.",189,,
907,0.97,7280.273,7281.54,We have not talked about crime rates.,189,,
908,0.97,7281.54,7289.615,Homicide events are up 17% this quarter with 17 incidents compared to 10 last year in the first quarter.,189,,
909,0.97,7289.615,7298.824,"Shootings are up 138%, or 62 events, compared to 26 of the previous year.",189,,
910,0.97,7298.824,7314.006,"These are real, live's behind those numbers and we've got to do something urgently to stop the killings and make our space safer for everyone.",189,,
911,0.97,7314.006,7323.749,The rationale for bringing this forward.,189,,
912,0.97,7323.749,7335.928,It is an emergency that I have not seen since I took the oath constituents and abide by the section of the Charter that says that it shall be maintained adequately in every city that is not happening now.,189,,
913,0.97,7335.928,7349.141,That is the big picture that I want to focus on as we discuss the particulars of my resolution and of what other pieces of legislation we will be considering today.,189,,
914,0.97,7349.141,7350.209,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",190,,
915,0.97,7350.209,7358.918,"Council member Lewis, I hear my --",190,,
916,0.97,7358.918,7361.32,"Councilmember Herbold, I am happy to defer to Councilmember Lewis.",191,,
917,0.97,7361.32,7363.989,Councilmember Lewis?,192,,
918,0.97,7363.989,7369.061,"Thank you so much, Madam chair.",193,,
919,0.97,7369.061,7386.312,I appreciate Councilmember Nelson raising this discussion because I think all of us can agree that we do have a hiring crisis for the Seattle police Department.,193,,
920,0.97,7386.312,7389.014,This Council has fully funded police hiring classes for the last several years.,193,,
921,0.97,7389.014,7394.82,There is clearly a strong commitment to make sure there is robust hiring classes available for SPD . We have seen the hiring classes fall short.,193,,
922,0.97,7394.82,7412.204,Councilmember Nelson noted in her statement right now that a lot of our Pier departments and a lot of departments in the region have hiring bonuses and have not been seeing the same level of recruitment challenges.,193,,
923,0.97,7412.204,7423.883,It is also notable that Spokane--according to a February 22 article--I believe the memo was incorrect.,193,,
924,0.97,7423.883,7425.718,I believe they do have a fairly modest hiring bonus.,193,,
925,0.97,7425.718,7427.553,"It is $10,000 for lateral, $5000 for new recruits.",193,,
926,0.97,7427.553,7431.19,Spokane has something like 700 openings.,193,,
927,0.97,7431.19,7449.208,"It is not clear to me that the hiring bonuses are having an effect . My question here is more, since we have the chief and we have some folks from the Department, to ask--I'm sorry.",193,,
928,0.97,7449.208,7453.345,"Did they leave, Councilmember Herbold?",193,,
929,0.97,7453.345,7454.68,I'm here.,194,,
930,0.97,7454.68,7460.853,"Sorry, chief . I did not see you here.",195,,
931,0.97,7460.853,7467.359,"When we were having this discussion a few weeks ago, one of the things I said and that statement was that I would appreciate hearing from the Department at the meeting.",196,,
932,0.97,7467.359,7475.901,Just take the 5000--what major cities in the United States are able to achieve that hiring right now?,196,,
933,0.97,7475.901,7484.61,"As we look across the country, we are not alone in having challenges attracting and retraining police.",196,,
934,0.97,7484.61,7489.548,It is happening in Progressive cities.,196,,
935,0.97,7489.548,7500.86,It is happening in conservative cities . urban police departments are having a challenge attracting and retaining officers in major cities.,196,,
936,0.97,7500.86,7531.957,"I wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to H█Ear if th Department particular national models in mind that were looking attractive in terms of what they are doing to attract new recruits and what some of the things that are working that we could potentially emulate, just to take a little bit of a step back, rather than focusing exclusively on one specific thing.",196,,
937,0.97,7531.957,7550.442,My suspicion is financial incentives will be necessary but not sufficient . I wanted to turn it over to the chief Adrian Diaz to hear more about that.,196,,
938,0.97,7550.442,7551.443,Thank you for that.,197,,
939,0.97,7551.443,7560.185,"We want to make sure we have a competitive, economic package that allows our officers and recruits thinking about coming back to the Department.",197,,
940,0.97,7560.185,7572.564,We look at top pay . There are agencies that are less costly have a hire pay than Seattle.,197,,
941,0.97,7572.564,7576.635,"In some cases, it takes time to get there.",197,,
942,0.97,7576.635,7578.637,They have an education center.,198,,
943,0.97,7578.637,7580.339,Nine of 13 have a hiring center.,198,,
944,0.97,7580.339,7584.977,Six of 13 have a Chase owned car.,198,,
945,0.97,7584.977,7596.055,"When it comes to major cities, a lot of major cities have experienced the same thing where most of their officers are not necessarily in the profession.",198,,
946,0.97,7596.055,7602.828,They are going to agencies around that area because they are offering some level of incentive.,198,,
947,0.97,7602.828,7619.244,"That is something that we have to make sure we are put into action, a very good economic package . We also have to be quick and agile.",198,,
948,0.97,7619.244,7622.548,"Many of the agencies are making changes, adjusting things within a very short period of time.",198,,
949,0.97,7622.548,7625.784,We are trying to navigate our process.,198,,
950,0.97,7625.784,7629.054,This is something that we have to be mindful of.,198,,
951,0.97,7629.054,7647.906,"One of the other things in talking with some of the major cities that people are--as people leave through the other agency locally, they are having less violence . They are having less things going on.",198,,
952,0.97,7647.906,7649.975,There are several things we are talking to people about.,198,,
953,0.97,7649.975,7651.61,Officers want to feel value.,198,,
954,0.97,7651.61,7653.412,They want to feel appreciated.,198,,
955,0.97,7653.412,7658.817,They are also thinking about their own health and well-being.,198,,
956,0.97,7658.817,7670.662,"When crime is going up and they are having to respond to call to call to call and they are not getting downtime, that does put a huge level of stress on them.",198,,
957,0.97,7670.662,7688.38,"If they can have less call response, that helps them with their own methods . We have to be mindful of that . As we talk about the crime, we have had a 17% increase in crime.",198,,
958,0.97,7688.38,7689.882,A 22% increase in violent crime.,198,,
959,0.97,7689.882,7699.558,One of the Statistics that is striking to me is that 56 out of the 127 guns that we recovered have been used in two or more incidents.,198,,
960,0.97,7699.558,7708.634,"What we are finding is that guns are being used routinely, regularly in several cases.",198,,
961,0.97,7708.634,7717.009,We had 41 guns that have been used in four shootings were more . What we are seeing is very similar to what Portland has seen.,198,,
962,0.97,7717.009,7725.551,And has almost doubled the amount of Homicides.,198,,
963,0.97,7725.551,7740.165,That is when I start to think about how do we ensure that our officers have the time off to be able to recoup? a healthy officer will have a healthy outcome in the street . that is what we all want.,198,,
964,0.97,7740.165,7746.872,We don't want ourselves in some sort of a violent situation where it is not safe for anybody.,198,,
965,0.97,7746.872,7758.584,We really start to think about how we take care of our officers and how do we staff enough officers so we are able to meet the community needs? we are able to investigate the sexual assault.,198,,
966,0.97,7758.584,7772.231,"These are all very, very trying things for a major city because some of the local agencies are Gobbling up that talent that we accumulated and built.",198,,
967,0.97,7772.231,7776.702,Are there particularly cities that are outperforming the trend in the Department?,199,,
968,0.97,7776.702,7791.783,This is not a Gotcha . I am not personally aware of any . I was just curious if the department had a specific suite of programs that is working effectively.,199,,
969,0.97,7791.783,7794.686,That does not mean we can't be the first but I am just wondering.,199,,
970,0.97,7794.686,7796.021,I have talked to San Diego.,200,,
971,0.97,7796.021,7800.292,I have talked to Baltimore.,200,,
972,0.97,7800.292,7807.633,"Have talked to other agencies across the country and they are all feeling the same effect, even in cities that have that level of support.",200,,
973,0.97,7807.633,7812.271,There is a lot more scrutiny in this job in a major city.,200,,
974,0.97,7812.271,7831.557,"We are just trying to figure out--it comes down to making sure we appreciate our officers, acknowledge the hard work they're having to do in the most challenging time and then making sure that we have a competitive economic package that allows us to support them.",200,,
975,0.97,7831.557,7839.298,One of the biggest things for them is we have the funds to be able to do it and it is being able to utilize those funds.,200,,
976,0.97,7839.298,7841.733,Councilmember Mosqueda?,201,,
977,0.97,7841.733,7846.572,Thank you very much for that.,202,,
978,0.97,7846.572,7849.274,"Again, I appreciate the conversation here today.",202,,
979,0.97,7849.274,7860.219,"There is a few points that I would like to make, both wearing the budget hat and also as a member of the committee here today.",202,,
980,0.97,7860.219,7880.906,One of the most important things that we are dealing with as a city right now is the ability to respond to the urgent crises that are affecting our community across Seattle and trying to make sure that we have both the resources to respond to the wake of the pandemic and to make sure that we are investing in member services.,202,,
981,0.97,7880.906,7884.743,One of the things we talked about the most is the need to protect general fund resources.,202,,
982,0.97,7884.743,7888.347,Spd's budget is primarily general fund resources.,202,,
983,0.97,7888.347,7894.119,"As it has been discussed, the housing committee has done a lot of time talking about this.",202,,
984,0.97,7894.119,7903.729,The city is currently facing a long-term structural budget issue where the general fund expenditures are outpacing the general fund revenue.,202,,
985,0.97,7903.729,7914.439,"This is not a shortfall in revenue, it is a gap in how fast revenue are keeping up with the inflating cost of service and the growing population across our city.",202,,
986,0.97,7914.439,7926.018,One of the most important things we need to be looking at right now is how we address this gap in ensuring we have the funding necessary for a robust budget for 2023 and 2024.,202,,
987,0.97,7926.018,7942.267,This is an issue that we will spend a lot of time talking about but we have to be looking at preserving funding and any 2022 under spend such as savings achieved through delayed Hirings or any under spend in 2022 for future investments in our budget.,202,,
988,0.97,7942.267,7965.223,"If the privies of remains in place and no other actions are taking to list or modified it, the general fund resources will continue to be restricted meaning that the money cannot be spent . at the end of 2022, this money will revert back to the general Fund and those funds would be assumed as part of our starting balance for 2023.",202,,
989,0.97,7965.223,7976.735,"My concern here is that the resolution and the expenditure we are talking about is suspending, meaning they would be taken from other programs, other investments from 2023 to 2024 if taxed.",202,,
990,0.97,7976.735,7993.652,I am raising questions here today about using critical public resources for a possible investment in a policy that has not been proven.,202,,
991,0.97,7993.652,7997.923,It has been said by some that there is no evidence to the contrary that shows that hiring does not work.,202,,
992,0.97,7997.923,7999.958,Let me point some of our colleagues to that evidence.,202,,
993,0.97,7999.958,8018.043,"In the recruitment and retention work group, final report, the work group did not identify pay as a barrier to either hiring or retention SPD employees and they also did not identify a hiring bonus or a lack of a hiring bonus as a problem, nor the recommendation.",202,,
994,0.97,8018.043,8037.329,"Four recommendations that they made from the work group include a focus on Leveraging technological solutions and provides business practices to engage candidates during the hiring process, advanced talent quickly through the process and extend the offer through a more competitive Timeframe.",202,,
995,0.97,8037.329,8051.977,I want to talk a little bit about competitive time frames and some of the offer concepts in a later part of this discussion but there has not been competitive conclusions that the hiring incentives level increases the number of people entering SPD.,202,,
996,0.97,8051.977,8075.901,Spd has noted--I appreciate the chief for highlighting this--that the bonus was an important factor for applicants in deciding whether or not to apply . The overall number of people who enter into the Seattle police Department through the program that we saw from late 2020 did not increase as a result of the hiring incentives.,202,,
997,0.97,8075.901,8100.926,"I think hiring bonuses are not part of the recommendation that we saw from the recruitment and retention work group, nor were they part of the report out that we heard in your Committee last time from the innovation and performance team, made up of SPD, Seattle Department of human resources, the city budget office, and other members of our city family.",202,,
998,0.97,8100.926,8106.598,"If we say we trust human resources, then let's trust them in what they said to us at the last committee meeting.",202,,
999,0.97,8106.598,8116.108,They report shows that we have a way early retirement coming and we have a commitment to social justice initiatives.,202,,
1000,0.97,8116.108,8122.647,Let's focus on diversity in our hiring program.,202,,
1001,0.97,8122.647,8136.027,We can focus on investments for city services and create opportunities . Let's focus on expanding the conversation about recruiting and retaining diverse talent and what it takes to be soft-spoken within the city.,202,,
1002,0.97,8136.027,8147.038,"The Department of human resources said, offering hiring incentives--I'm quoting here--is a short term strategy meant to induce a prospective job officer.",202,,
1003,0.97,8147.038,8194.352,"King County has been offering people incentives while some departments in Seattle have observed a clear and positive benefit . This must be weighed against other solutions that have potentially inherent drawbacks . equity issues for both the employer and employee, they go on to talk about how these one-time solutions may not compensate for uncompetitive waiters . relevant skills, experiences, they talk about how signing notices can negatively impact employee morale and employees who are promoted internally and already working the job are still undervalued and Underappreciated.",202,,
1004,0.97,8194.352,8205.497,"That is the opposite of what I think we should be doing for our city families right now who have been working throughout this pandemic into our like everyone across this country, dealing with the ongoing stress that is created by it.",202,,
1005,0.97,8205.497,8216.441,Let's look at what hr has picked up.,202,,
1006,0.97,8216.441,8221.947,We want to build on the regulations from some of the resources.,202,,
1007,0.97,8221.947,8251.243,"That is where I would like to look, with limited resources that we have . given the long- term structural budget issues, we need to look across departments, address staffing shortages and opportunities for us to create a more stable city core services that may include SPD but needs to be broadly looked at across our entire city family and not focused solely on the incentive program that does not have the data to back up whether or not the outcome is schedule.",202,,
1008,0.97,8251.243,8256.314,"Madam chair, those are my comments both from the budget wearing hat and also from the concern around data.",202,,
1009,0.97,8256.314,8257.716,Thank you.,203,,
1010,0.97,8257.716,8262.787,I really need us to wrap it up.,203,,
1011,0.97,8262.787,8264.623,We devoted 30 minutes on the agenda for this item.,203,,
1012,0.97,8264.623,8268.693,This was intended to daylight the two proposals.,203,,
1013,0.97,8268.693,8280.705,"Councilmember Nelson, you had asked to come back to Committee for a vote . We will have more debate then . We have been discussing this item for 55 minutes now.",203,,
1014,0.97,8280.705,8287.178,I would like Allie to very briefly daylight the alternate proposal.,203,,
1015,0.97,8287.178,8290.949,Thank you.,203,,
1016,0.97,8290.949,8294.085,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",204,,
1017,0.97,8294.085,8296.121,Good morning.,204,,
1018,0.97,8296.121,8312.37,"I am from Council central staff . I am going to ask Greg to share his screen, to put up the proposal that is a Council bill related to Councilmember Nelson's resolution.",204,,
1019,0.97,8312.37,8322.714,Councilmember Herbold has a draft Council bill that would modify the proviso that is currently imposed on SPD's salary table in 2022.,204,,
1020,0.97,8322.714,8337.328,"The modifications would allow up to $650,000 for SPD salary savings to be used to offer to pay for moving expenses for new recruits as well as a new recruiter.",204,,
1021,0.97,8337.328,8356.981,"In addition, it asks the Seattle Department of human resources to amend city personnel rule to expand eligibility to a broader range of positions that would currently allow us to be able to offer the expenses forwarded to them if the hiring authority determines that they are unable to recruit in the local area.",204,,
1022,0.97,8356.981,8385.877,"That request would ask for a broad expansion of the moving expense allowances currently in place . It also asks the human resources Department to Prioritize, implementing those changes for the Seattle police Department police hires if it would make it more efficient to do that change first and then take up the broader expansion on a separate track.",204,,
1023,0.97,8385.877,8391.583,"That is a brief overview, council member Herbold.",204,,
1024,0.97,8391.583,8393.952,Did you want me to go into more detail?,204,,
1025,0.97,8393.952,8395.42,No . that is good.,205,,
1026,0.97,8395.42,8408.433,I want to say a couple very short words about my thinking on this bill . The executive does not recommend the bonus program.,205,,
1027,0.97,8408.433,8423.281,We provided that opportunity to make that recommendation with our statement of legislative intent in November . Council was concerned about the hiring trend for SPD and that is why we requested the statement of legislative intent.,205,,
1028,0.97,8423.281,8445.804,"The executive does not recommend a bonus program, a traditional bonus program but they are supportive of looking towards supporting SPD and other departments who are trying to hire important to city business positions, pay for their relocation costs.",205,,
1029,0.97,8445.804,8458.383,"I really hope that in the spirit of one Seattle, we can harness the agreement that any departments, including SPD, are having with these challenges.",205,,
1030,0.97,8458.383,8463.488,We can support the bill . This is a Council bill.,205,,
1031,0.97,8463.488,8466.324,It would be implemented in contrast to a resolution that States intent.,205,,
1032,0.97,8466.324,8531.122,"Why not boat to act rather than voting on intent? I just want to also flag that when this bill does release the Council proviso on police officer hiring but only for the number of dollars that are anticipated to be needed whereas the--as I understand, there was little bit of conflict between the resolution stated intent and the description of it . My concern would be if we were to fully lift the proviso, we would be releasing all of those funds to the Seattle police Department . Maybe some of them should stay there, as I am proposing to do but we need to have conversations between the departments and the Council and also considering as our budget chair has mentioned, considering the other demands on the budget.",205,,
1033,0.97,8531.122,8532.924,I am really excited to bring this forward.,205,,
1034,0.97,8532.924,8541.666,This is something we can do now . I am looking forward to having more conversation about Úit at our next meeting.,205,,
1035,0.97,8541.666,8546.137,Councilmember Pedersen?,206,,
1036,0.97,8546.137,8547.005,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",207,,
1037,0.97,8547.005,8555.914,"I really appreciate Councilmember Nelson bringing forward a resolution . As I mentioned previously, I support her resolution.",207,,
1038,0.97,8555.914,8564.856,I'm also intrigued I the chair's proposed Council bill regarding relocation expenses.,207,,
1039,0.97,8564.856,8583.141,I would be interested in seeing a larger number and getting some analysis from SPD if they need additional dollars and what is in the Council bill since there is potentially up to $4 million that could be available.,207,,
1040,0.97,8583.141,8584.342,I would like to optimize that.,207,,
1041,0.97,8584.342,8585.743,To appreciate the comments for our budget chair.,207,,
1042,0.97,8585.743,8599.157,"We are very fortunate to have her on the committee, to keep an eye on the budget for us . I appreciate the concerns about the budget shortfall or gap that we will be facing.",207,,
1043,0.97,8599.157,8629.187,"The way I am understanding these incentives is if they end up not working--giving SPD is additional tool at other jurisdictions have and then if they don't work, the money is not spent . Maybe there is a way to give them nine months, up to $4 million to make it work and if it doesn't work, they can revert back to something else to help with the budget but I really appreciate the robust debate today and I look forward to the next meeting.",207,,
1044,0.97,8629.187,8631.422,Thank you.,208,,
1045,0.97,8631.422,8635.927,Councilmember Nelson?,208,,
1046,0.97,8635.927,8640.198,Thank you very much.,209,,
1047,0.97,8640.198,8646.304,I would like to comment on a couple of notes.,209,,
1048,0.97,8646.304,8655.179,I do not see that this staff--the development of a staffing program will take away from other needs.,209,,
1049,0.97,8655.179,8659.884,This money is in public safety.,209,,
1050,0.97,8659.884,8672.697,"What will it be spent on otherwise, given the absolute critical nature of our deteriorating public health and public safety situation and a historic staffing shortage?",209,,
1051,0.97,8672.697,8675.8,We've got a perfect storm here that needs to be dealt with.,209,,
1052,0.97,8675.8,8680.838,This money does not take away from other things.,209,,
1053,0.97,8680.838,8688.146,What I am hearing is that people--they got their hands on this money to use for other things.,209,,
1054,0.97,8688.146,8692.35,That is one thing I will note.,209,,
1055,0.97,8692.35,8703.061,"I read--anyway--it was a great question by Councilmember Lewis to ask, what are the cities doing for staffing solutions.",209,,
1056,0.97,8703.061,8714.739,"What was not looked at, are those other cities dealing with the level of separations that we are?",209,,
1057,0.97,8714.739,8715.573,Due to low morale?,209,,
1058,0.97,8715.573,8716.574,Due to better opportunities elsewhere?,209,,
1059,0.97,8716.574,8731.889,Last week I spoke to an officer out of the North precinct who said she signed three letters of recommendation for officers to leave our Department and go elsewhere . I will note that we keep going back to this two page document.,209,,
1060,0.97,8731.889,8736.694,It does not provide numbers fulfilling all non-police Department positions.,209,,
1061,0.97,8736.694,8747.038,We don't really know what it will take to meet that policy goal in this ordinance.,209,,
1062,0.97,8747.038,8762.019,"One thing that I will say is that I have read this ordinance and when I launched on my resolution in a spirit of collaboration, I offered the chair the opportunity of Cosponsoring.",209,,
1063,0.97,8762.019,8765.89,You declined . We have not been really working in tandem since then.,209,,
1064,0.97,8765.89,8788.679,"Now, we have an ordinance that, from my perspective, is overly limiting of the ability of SPD to actually create a program that will be competitive . I don't see how we are going to get to 98 new hires this year if we have only had 13 so far.",209,,
1065,0.97,8788.679,8794.318,"Clearly, we need something else to get us there.",209,,
1066,0.97,8794.318,8814.472,"Again, your ordinance to lift the proviso provides $650,000 for Relocations, expenses, and for the hiring of a new police recruiter which is a great thing and very much needed.",209,,

1216,0.97,10110.066,10127.951,"This amendment would change the definition for engaged time for On-Demand companies and On- demand offers . As you recall, On-Demand offer must be initiated with two hours of acceptance . As drafted, engaged time for On-Demand offers begins when the offer is accepted by the worker.",250,,
1217,0.97,10127.951,10135.458,It is intended to reflect that a worker may need to drive immediately to the destination or may be unable to accept other offers before initiating the performance.,250,,
1218,0.97,10135.458,10143.166,This could create a situation in which a worker is paid for time between sessions and when they initiate the form.,250,,
1219,0.97,10143.166,10163.253,"However, we believe it is unlikely that they would be a two are gap between acceptance and initiation because companies will likely not present the offer until us close to initiation as possible and because workers are Incentivized to initiate the offers as quickly as possible.",250,,
1220,0.97,10163.253,10173.63,"Again, this requested amendment would change the definition of engaged time for when the offer is accepted to when the offer is initiated.",250,,
1221,0.97,10173.63,10184.841,This would likely reduce the amount of engaged time to some degree but the impact will be determined by the definition of initiate performance.,250,,
1222,0.97,10184.841,10186.643,"Currently, that is not refined and legislation.",250,,
1223,0.97,10186.643,10198.154,"It was anticipated that it would be clarified by Stakeholder engagement and Rulemaking, therefore exactly how this amendment would impact would depend on the definition.",250,,
1224,0.97,10198.154,10226.849,"As the Council is considering the legislation, they might want to amend the legislation as described . could provide additional clarity by defining what initiation of the legislation means or they could request the office and labor standards to define initiation of performance or they could make a change to the legislation at this point.",250,,
1225,0.97,10226.849,10231.921,Are there any questions about that one?,250,,
1226,0.97,10231.921,10239.462,I am hoping you can highlight a number that is drawn . that would be helpful on the screen.,251,,
1227,0.97,10239.462,10240.697,Thank you so much.,251,,
1228,0.97,10240.697,10245.735,Perfect.,251,,
1229,0.97,10245.735,10248.771,"If there aren't any questions about that, I will move to the next one.",252,,
1230,0.97,10248.771,10260.35,I was going to hop to a table for this one.,252,,
1231,0.97,10260.35,10267.056,The second potential amendment for discussion is number seven in a town on page 6 of the memo.,252,,
1232,0.97,10267.056,10273.763,"For this item, I want to show you this table.",252,,
1233,0.97,10273.763,10280.303,They are intended to ensure that the minimum payment covers expenses incurred by workers.,252,,
1234,0.97,10280.303,10291.014,They are not necessarily a one- For-One reimbursement but should generally ensure that the independent workers can import similar benefits that workers classify as employees enjoy.,252,,
1235,0.97,10291.014,10296.719,"As noted in the memo, there has been interest in reducing the input to the minimum payment calculation.",252,,
1236,0.97,10296.719,10320.476,"This includes reducing the associated cost factor from 1.132 1.1, reducing the associated time proctor from 1.21 21.5, reducing the standard mileage rate from .5 2.3 and reducing the associated mileage factor from 1.25 21.05.",252,,
1237,0.97,10320.476,10332.055,On page 8 of the memo is a table that show the total impact on payment for several different types of offers.,252,,
1238,0.97,10332.055,10337.126,These changes would reduce the minimum payment received by workers.,252,,
1239,0.97,10337.126,10343.433,I do want to highlight that changing the standard mileage rate is different than the other changes that are requested.,252,,
1240,0.97,10343.433,10358.481,"First, it would have the largest impact on minimum payment . It would propose the standard mileage rate that is set by the Internal Revenue Department annually.",252,,
1241,0.97,10358.481,10399.288,"Therefore, the legislation does not contemplate any way to change the mileage rate . of the committee chooses to set a different mileage rate, they might want to consider how the rate should be adjusted in the future to reflect any changes and also they may want to use a different room to avoid confusion with a generally misunderstood definition . The options for the Council to consider are to amend the legislation to reduce the standard mileage to $0.30 with no provision for adjustment guidance on factors for adjustments.",252,,
1242,0.97,10399.288,10414.537,They can amend the legislation to reduce the standard mileage to $0.30 but also add some sort of provision for discretionary adjustments from the director with some guidance on factors to consider for adjustments.,252,,
1243,0.97,10414.537,10424.447,The committee would consider amending the legislation to reduce the standard mileage rate to $0.30 for periodic Nondiscretionary adjustments.,252,,
1244,0.97,10424.447,10435.391,The committee could also amend the legislation to reduce the associated factor and associated mileage factor as requested.,252,,
1245,0.97,10435.391,10444.801,War they can make no change to the legislation.,252,,
1246,0.97,10444.801,10450.239,Are there any questions about that particular request?,252,,
1247,0.97,10450.239,10468.357,"As you probably have made this perfectly clear, I did not catch it . It is not an all or nothing on the turning of the dial?",253,,
1248,0.97,10468.357,10470.393,It could be a Mix-And-Match approach?,253,,
1249,0.97,10470.393,10470.827,Absolutely.,254,,
1250,0.97,10470.827,10474.997,It does not have to be that particular reduction.,254,,
1251,0.97,10474.997,10480.136,This is--it is not a specific calculation.,254,,
1252,0.97,10480.136,10490.112,"Therefore, the range could be anywhere between what is proposed and what is requested on any one of those particular factors.",254,,
1253,0.97,10490.112,10492.748,Okay.,255,,
1254,0.97,10492.748,10502.692,The next one that I wanted to discuss is number 11. let me make sure you can see that.,255,,
1255,0.97,10502.692,10510.6,I will highlight it . The third potential amendment for discussion is number 11 which is found on page 10 of the memo.,255,,
1256,0.97,10510.6,10519.742,The Council bill is introduced would require the company to Captivate the minimum payment for each completed offer.,255,,
1257,0.97,10519.742,10530.453,"This requested change would allow companies to calculate the minimum payment per paid period and there would be a maximum pay period of seven days, basically a week.",255,,
1258,0.97,10530.453,10546.569,"The weekly pay standard is how pay is calculated in California and therefore, summoned network companies already calculate payments in this way.",255,,
1259,0.97,10546.569,10553.609,"If Seattle used this standard, it would not require any technological or policy changes to meet the Seattle requirements.",255,,
1260,0.97,10553.609,10563.252,"However, it could result in the minimum network payment paying maximum rather than a minimum.",255,,
1261,0.97,10563.252,10578.067,"That is what folks are seeing in California . In addition, App based workers believe this change could reduce the opportunity to earn incentives which are currently made primarily on the offer based.",255,,
1262,0.97,10578.067,10586.175,The committee could consider amending the legislation as requested for no change to the legislation.,255,,
1263,0.97,10586.175,10590.646,Are there any questions or comments about that?,255,,
1264,0.97,10590.646,10594.083,Councilmember Mosqueda?,256,,
1265,0.97,10594.083,10614.203,"On amendment 11 here, we are hearing some interest that there is weekly PAYOUT but now I am understanding this to be more along the lines of averaging wages or compensation by an entire week versus the hours worked.",257,,
1266,0.97,10614.203,10625.114,"While I understand there is reference to California, there is no other worker pool.",257,,
1267,0.97,10625.114,10635.925,I am not aware of any other App based standard that is calculated on a weekly standard other than California but I can look into that.,258,,
1268,0.97,10635.925,10644.667,"You are right that they do think that when you talk about a weekly pay standard, there are two ways of looking at it.",258,,
1269,0.97,10644.667,10647.937,One is how is it actually calculated?,258,,
1270,0.97,10647.937,10654.61,"Then, the request is for the calculation to be by a week.",258,,
1271,0.97,10654.61,10673.729,"It is not just that they PAYOUT weekly . The PAYOUT weekly could be based on a calculation that is per offer . just to clarify, this is about the calculation, not when it is paid out.",258,,
1272,0.97,10673.729,10682.872,I can look for some other examples of weekly PAYOUT standards for App based workers but I'm not aware of any.,258,,
1273,0.97,10682.872,10686.842,Councilmember Nelson?,259,,
1274,0.97,10686.842,10690.179,This amendment does get at one of my concerns.,260,,
1275,0.97,10690.179,10705.227,A potential demand--reduction in demand with Driest impact over Driest income . I do think that this gets to looking at Income-Based on previous weeks.,260,,
1276,0.97,10705.227,10720.443,This is put forward--they have provided as many details for that alternate way of figuring pay.,260,,
1277,0.97,10720.443,10724.914,It is very interesting.,261,,
1278,0.97,10724.914,10735.257,Drive forward and working Washington are trying to address the vaccine issue . They want to solve for the same issue.,261,,
1279,0.97,10735.257,10738.561,They have different ideas about how to do so.,261,,
1280,0.97,10738.561,10756.812,They are both concerned about creating a floor--drive forward is concerned what the daily standards will create.,261,,
1281,0.97,10756.812,10763.719,They are averaging over the course of the week.,261,,
1282,0.97,10763.719,10779.969,We are going to have to put our thinking hats on for that because it is compelling to me that both groups have the same concern but have a different concern about how to address it.,261,,
1283,0.97,10779.969,10783.272,Are you ready to move on?,262,,
1284,0.97,10783.272,10792.148,The next item that they wanted to highlight is discussion number 14.,263,,
1285,0.97,10792.148,10802.758,It is found on page 11 of the memo . This amendment would remove the tip amount from the list of information that must be provided to workers from part of the office presentation.,263,,
1286,0.97,10802.758,10812.735,"Just to clarify, it is only required if the company collects that information from the customer prior to the offer being presented to the worker.",263,,
1287,0.97,10812.735,10830.553,"This change, with response to a concern that provided information would enable some workers to only accept offers with the largest tips which would make it more difficult for other workers to compete for the highest tip offers.",263,,
1288,0.97,10830.553,10859.281,"However, given the tips can be a large portion of a workers compensation, knowing a tip amount prior to acceptance would give the worker more control over the pay and help them make more informed choices about what offers to accept so that Councilmembers might want to consider amending the legislation as requested or making no change.",263,,
1289,0.97,10859.281,10861.016,Are there any questions about that?,264,,
1290,0.97,10861.016,10864.253,Councilmember Mosqueda?,265,,
1291,0.97,10864.253,10867.923,"Thank you very much, Madam chair.",266,,
1292,0.97,10867.923,10869.358,Just a quick question.,266,,
1293,0.97,10869.358,10874.93,I don't believe New York City included this type of policy in their proposal.,266,,
1294,0.97,10874.93,10876.432,Is that correct?,266,,
1295,0.97,10876.432,10878.267,"New York City, I don't believe so.",267,,
1296,0.97,10878.267,10884.173,"Just to be clear, New York City has not yet implemented their changes.",267,,
1297,0.97,10884.173,10887.81,What they have done is requested that their version of Ols develop policy.,267,,
1298,0.97,10887.81,10890.045,It has not yet been passed.,267,,
1299,0.97,10890.045,10895.718,Some of these details have not yet been finalized.,267,,
1300,0.97,10895.718,10915.271,I will double check but I don't think that is included in the policy direction given to the Department as part of the foundation for the policy they would be developing.,267,,
1301,0.97,10915.271,10927.249,Moving on . The fifth potential amendment I wanted to discuss was number 16 and it is found on page 12 of the memo.,268,,
1302,0.97,10927.249,10951.807,"The legislation as proposed would require that companies provide a written receipt to the worker within 24 hours and with itemized things including compensation, tip, engage time, miles, and other information about the offer and how it led to the actual wage paid.",268,,
1303,0.97,10951.807,10954.343,The requested change would give Councilmembers 48 hours to provide the receipt.,268,,
1304,0.97,10954.343,10959.949,Obviously that would help them by giving them a little bit more time to develop that.,268,,
1305,0.97,10959.949,10981.303,"However, on the other hand, it might make it more difficult for workers to remember what happened and to correct any receipts or payback that is incorrect.",268,,
1306,0.97,10986.008,11012.534,"The next two that I wanted to discuss our number 17, which is on page 12 of the memo and page 18 which is right after it, both items 17 and 18 address marketplace network companies but with a mutually exclusive as currently completed.",269,,
1307,0.97,11012.534,11016.205,"As we discussed previously in Committee, marketplace network companies are different than other network companies.",269,,
1308,0.97,11016.205,11028.584,They do not intermediate the information on the scope and details of any type of offer prior to the placement and acceptance of the offer.,269,,
1309,0.97,11028.584,11034.289,They also did not monitor the location or mileage and time.,269,,
1310,0.97,11034.289,11047.669,"In response, the legislation defines marketplace network companies and has a different type of regulation for the companies which we discussed in Committee on April 12.",269,,
1311,0.97,11047.669,11053.175,There is interest in exempting marketplace network companies from legislation.,269,,
1312,0.97,11053.175,11062.117,This exemption would mean that marketplace network companies would not have to make changes to their operation in order to comply with the legislation's requirement.,269,,
1313,0.97,11062.117,11098.053,"I will note that both the companies and the workers are--they both would rather avoid creating more tracking of workers . that is a common goal but it would mean that workers performing offers would not be covered by any of the legislation protection including the minimum payment standard, transparency requirements like information about the offer prior to acceptance, nor would they be testing the positive ability standards.",269,,
1314,0.97,11098.053,11115.737,Creating another thing--creating this exemption identify companies that currently don't meet the definition to change the bill.,270,,
1315,0.97,11115.737,11135.224,The committee may want to consider excluding marketplace network companies from the minimum payment standard or other of the regulations that are most challenging but maintain some of the transparency and flexibility requirements.,270,,
1316,0.97,11135.224,11150.873,"Again, the options are to amend the legislation as requested, amend the legislation to exclude some of the regulations but not all, or to make no change to the legislation.",270,,
1317,0.97,11150.873,11158.38,Are there any comments or questions about that?,270,,
1318,0.97,11158.38,11163.051,The seventh potential amendment for discussion is number 18 and it is found on page 13 of the memo.,271,,
1319,0.97,11163.051,11174.363,This is a second option which would further revive the regulations.,271,,
1320,0.97,11174.363,11176.265,These are three specific changes that have been requested.,271,,
1321,0.97,11176.265,11194.716,The first change is to amend the marketplace definition to include companies that are primarily engaged in the scheduled offers rather than exclude the wages and that are primarily facilitated without monitoring rather than exclusively.,271,,
1322,0.97,11194.716,11209.164,This change would expand the definition of marketplace network companies and may result in more companies meeting the definition . It would also require more Rulemaking by Ols to determine what primarily would mean in this instance.,271,,
1323,0.97,11209.164,11217.906,The second request is to change engaged time is estimated for marketplace network companies.,271,,
1324,0.97,11217.906,11232.521,"For marketplace network companies that don't track the time the worker spends performing the offer, the engaged time can be based on an estimate that is agreed to by the customer and the worker to offer acceptance.",271,,
1325,0.97,11232.521,11239.828,"Therefore, pay would be based on this estimate rather than the actual time spent working.",271,,
1326,0.97,11239.828,11252.441,This requested change would go a step further and state that the required reasonable estimate of engaged time could be met by listing the range of time and compensation equivalent to at least one hour of engaged time in a 24-hour period.,271,,
1327,0.97,11252.441,11262.217,This is intended to address situations like pet sitting where there may be time spent either away from the task were when a worker is not completely relieved of duties.,271,,
1328,0.97,11262.217,11272.527,"However, it could further diminish the amount of engaged time for workers, making it less reflective of the actual time work and decrease the actual time for workers.",271,,
1329,0.97,11272.527,11288.91,The third request that I am putting under this bucket of marketplace revisions is to exclude marketplace network companies from the requirements to provide a weekly summary of offers including pay and other information for workers.,271,,
1330,0.97,11288.91,11306.828,"As I mentioned previously, there is a requirement that there is a per offer receipt that is sent to the worker within 24 hours as well as this Úweekly summary of these receipts.",271,,
1331,0.97,11306.828,11319.274,The request is that the marketplace network companies be excluded from that particular requirement.,271,,
1332,0.97,11319.274,11325.38,"The options related to this will be to amend the legislation with all or some of the amendments as described, or to not make any changes to the legislation.",271,,
1333,0.97,11325.38,11334.489,"Or, as I mentioned before, to exclude them completely.",271,,
1334,0.97,11334.489,11340.796,If there is not--are there any questions or comments about either 17 or 18?,271,,
1335,0.97,11340.796,11341.63,Okay.,271,,
1336,0.97,11341.63,11348.904,"If not, I will now turn it over to the Jasmine Marwaha for the next item for discussion.",271,,
1337,0.97,11348.904,11352.107,Thank you.,272,,
1338,0.97,11352.107,11366.388,Number 19 is a potential amendment that would have them develop and present proposed rules to Council before passage of the legislation.,272,,
1339,0.97,11366.388,11373.095,"Under the Seattle municipal code, the director has the authority to issue rules as deemed necessary to carry out the functions of the Department.",272,,
1340,0.97,11373.095,11384.673,"In addition to the general authority, the proposed ordinance specifically mandates or allows for the Ols director to clarify certain aspects of the bill.",272,,
1341,0.97,11384.673,11420.408,"My understanding is that Councilmembers may have concerns with invoking this authority . options listed in the memo can postpone the vote on the bill until proposals are provided by the Ols director, to not postpone the vote but request that the director of elephant rules, provide them to the committee before the effective date and to not postpone a request for official rules.",272,,
1342,0.97,11420.408,11425.08,"If there is interest in postponing a vote on the bill until Ols provides proposed rules, there are couple of things to note.",272,,
1343,0.97,11425.08,11441.53,"One, whatever process Ols may undertake before a bill is passed, I am not sure if it would officially be able to be fully processed . There may not be a law where the problem issued rules will be necessary to administer at that time.",272,,
1344,0.97,11441.53,11454.943,"I have to check with the city attorney's office and Ols but my understanding is that once the bill has passed, we go through the official process of publishing a draft and having a comment filed with the clerk.",272,,
1345,0.97,11454.943,11462.617,"Essentially, this amendment might create a preview process and an official process after the bill.",272,,
1346,0.97,11462.617,11471.259,"Again, I have to clarify what that list is.",272,,
1347,0.97,11471.259,11498.353,"Then, there is potentially another option to consider, which is to identify the areas that Council does not want to delegate and then to clarify the language for those specific aspects of the ordinance . I do believe some of the other potential amendments have been drafted with those issues.",272,,
1348,0.97,11498.353,11501.656,Councilmember Nelson?,273,,
1349,0.97,11501.656,11513.235,The amendment that was suggested to me by central staff and that I forwarded as my preference was different than the one provided here.,274,,
1350,0.97,11513.235,11516.905,It was basically--Council past the legislation.,274,,
1351,0.97,11516.905,11557.512,Ols says it is Rulemaking but the legislation does not go into it or would be implemented until Council then APPROVES the rule that was developed by Ols . might be different way of going about Rulemaking but a lot of companies out there who don't know yet if they will be covered because--we will have a chance to perhaps make Tweaks per their input.,274,,
1352,0.97,11557.512,11561.383,Okay.,275,,
1353,0.97,11561.383,11570.458,"That is something I will have to check in with, to see if it would be something to include in the ordinance itself.",275,,
1354,0.97,11570.458,11580.669,Thank you.,275,,
1355,0.97,11581.336,11591.846,Are there any other questions or comments? we have the next set of amendments will be discussed by Karina Bull.,275,,
1356,0.97,11591.846,11592.681,"Thank you, Jasmine.",276,,
1357,0.97,11592.681,11596.952,The next amendment is number 20 and it is on page 15.,276,,
1358,0.97,11596.952,11615.203,"This amendment W█Ould Appropriae funding for an independent study of potential impacts of the minimum payment regulation on drivers, network companies, partner businesses, and/or customers.",276,,
1359,0.97,11615.203,11622.377,"The idea of funding a study, whether it would happen before or after legislation is not new in consideration of labor standards.",276,,
1360,0.97,11622.377,11628.617,It has happened in the past when it was originally passed.,276,,
1361,0.97,11628.617,11630.418,There was an implementation study.,276,,
1362,0.97,11630.418,11642.931,"It also happened before and after the minimum wage for employees, before the minimum compensation standards for drivers and before and after for the secure scheduling coordinates.",276,,
1363,0.97,11642.931,11655.01,Will some labor standards are considered by policy organizations and businesses as well.,276,,
1364,0.97,11655.01,11664.953,"As far as considering items to inform a decision on whether or not to have a study, there is timing aspect's as we just went over before.",276,,
1365,0.97,11664.953,11695.45,"The participation of Stakeholders and whether the study would just be an academic study or whether the city would engage whole range of Stakeholders as drivers and companies and workers and organizations, the administration of the study, what Department would do it and the path, it was contemplated in the Tmc minimum compensation ordinance that Ols actually conduct the study.",276,,
1366,0.97,11695.45,11696.951,That would need to be considered.,276,,
1367,0.97,11696.951,11710.065,"Of course, the cost, which varies on the breadth of the study itself.",276,,
1368,0.97,11710.065,11713.535,"There is the academic study, $53,000, additional money spent on the outreach and engagement.",276,,
1369,0.97,11713.535,11726.514,"There was a total cost of about $765,000 for a three-part study that included baseline and then two separate years of impacts after the legislation was passed.",276,,
1370,0.97,11726.514,11736.658,Options for considering this amendment would include postponing the boat on this bill to examine and model the potential impact to inform the regulation prior to voting.,276,,
1371,0.97,11736.658,11758.213,"Another option would be not postponing the vote and funding a study to monitor the impacts of the legislation after it goes into effect and then use those findings to potentially modify the regulations of the future . last, to not postpone the vote or fund the study of the impacts.",276,,
1372,0.97,11758.213,11764.085,Are there any questions on that potential amendment?,276,,
1373,0.97,11764.085,11764.285,Okay.,276,,
1374,0.97,11764.285,11770.592,We will going to the next one which is amendment number 24 on the memo on page 18.,276,,
1375,0.97,11770.592,11780.335,Determine the funding needed for office of labor standards to administer and enforce this bill.,276,,
1376,0.97,11780.335,11803.258,"Currently, office of labor standards is estimating that it would cost $1.2 million in the first year and ongoing to implement this bill that would consist of $566,000 for imitation costs, which includes outreach, contract with organizations, et cetera and about 670,000 for staffing.",276,,
1377,0.97,11803.258,11808.396,That would be for five positions.,276,,
1378,0.97,11808.396,11813.268,The budget that Ols is proposing is outlined in the memos.,276,,
1379,0.97,11813.268,11816.504,You can see all of the different components of it.,276,,
1380,0.97,11816.504,11822.911,This would mean that Ols would likely need to start work immediately on this legislation.,276,,
1381,0.97,11822.911,11853.875,"It is unknown right now what portion, if any of these resources, would be needed immediately or would be considered as part of the 2023 budget . Currently, central staff is working with Ols to determine . are there any questions about this particular amendment?",276,,
1382,0.97,11853.875,11865.42,"Related to that, a potential amendment number 25 which would be identifying and appropriating resources for office of labor standards to administer legislation.",277,,
1383,0.97,11865.42,11887.208,"Currently, Ols reports that they do not have the resources to administer legislation, hence the cost estimate of $1.2 million . Central staff is not aware of current general fund resources available to support this expense after offsetting a reduction of appropriations.",277,,
1384,0.97,11887.208,11895.917,There would be a need to identify resources for implementation of this bill.,277,,
1385,0.97,11895.917,11899.32,"Some items to consider would be office of labor standards, civil penalties.",277,,
1386,0.97,11899.32,11910.865,There are civil penalties already included in this legislation that could be used to support office of labor standards.,277,,
1387,0.97,11910.865,11927.615,"However, the practice is to Prioritize civil penalties to the worker rather than to the office.",277,,
1388,0.97,11927.615,11931.886,The office is trying to collect a penalty to further benefits.,277,,
1389,0.97,11931.886,11937.158,"However, that could be changed.",277,,
1390,0.97,11937.158,11949.604,There could be mandatory penalties that go to support the office or some jurisdictions that have provisions that require the company to pay for the cost of the investigation.,277,,
1391,0.97,11949.604,11952.206,That would be something that the office of labor standards would calculate.,277,,
1392,0.97,11952.206,11956.01,There are a variety of options.,277,,
1393,0.97,11956.01,11961.115,Another option is the Ols sub Fund.,277,,
1394,0.97,11961.115,11974.495,There is an existing law that establishes a special sub Fund.,277,,
1395,0.97,11974.495,11986.708,"Since then, council would have a minimum annual contribution where the director says what is needed to support the offices important outreach.",277,,
1396,0.97,11986.708,12002.357,"If the director were to increase that annual contribution, the appropriations would have more items in the city budget would be reduced.",277,,
1397,0.97,12002.357,12033.254,"Another possible idea is a fee on network companies . There are other administrative activities, the most relevant example would be the taxes paid per ride and that covers estimated enforcement costs of the Tmc licensing vehicle Endorsements and Ols enforcement of the minimum compensation ordinance.",277,,
1398,0.97,12033.254,12059.447,"As far as options to consider, it could be expecting to voluntarily use some of their civil penalties to cover a patient costs, mandate some portion, uses some of the business and occupation tasks to fund the implantation or establishes the tax to uncover these costs.",277,,
1399,0.97,12059.447,12066.754,The final option could be to delay action until sufficient resources are identified.,277,,
1400,0.97,12066.754,12071.025,Are there any questions in that possible amendment?,277,,
1401,0.97,12071.025,12077.532,I want to thank you for identifying what we should consider on the funding page.,278,,
1402,0.97,12077.532,12080.168,You are very welcome.,279,,
1403,0.97,12080.168,12099.253,I'm not sure if I mentioned in my discussion of the budget that there is a state bill 200 736 that impacted office of labor standards from continuing to enforce the driver minimum compensation.,279,,
1404,0.97,12099.253,12109.397,We will find out how to fund those in the future.,279,,
1405,0.97,12109.397,12111.666,I believe that brings us to a close of the amendments.,280,,
1406,0.97,12111.666,12116.304,"Amy, anything you would like to add?",280,,
1407,0.97,12116.304,12121.209,We can't hear you.,281,,

1410,0.97,12131.552,12148.836,"Given the number of potential amendments, we request that you let us know what amendments you would like to sponsor by the end of the day tomorrow so that we can get to work making sure those amendments are ready for a vote during the committee meeting.",282,,
1411,0.97,12148.836,12150.238,"Thank you, Amy.",283,,
1412,0.97,12150.238,12171.993,"One thing that has not been discussed yet, as far as the next step, considering along with my Co-Chair on this legislation, a request of the committee to join us in a public hearing on this legislation.",283,,
1413,0.97,12171.993,12185.573,More to be heard from folks and I think that would be a good step . more to come on that.,283,,

1418,0.97,12221.742,12240.428,"With something like this, when we are trying to help and lift up and empower workers to make sure there is transparency and accountability, having the opportunity to sit at those Rulemaking tables is something I know that has been valued from diverse Stakeholders in the past.",286,,
