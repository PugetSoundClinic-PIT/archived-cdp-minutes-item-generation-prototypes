53,0.97,327.427,335.234,"But we are seeing in both the house and the Senate is actually a pretty stark reversal of fortunes compared to what we saw over the summer, which is a pretty significant and sizable increase in investments and funding.",19,,

77,0.97,968.567,972.871,They still vary in implementation Timelines . The Senate bill has a more expedited approach to all of this with the updates.,22,,

110,0.97,1315.213,1322.187,I wanted to talk briefly about the legislative response to the Blake decision.,25,,
111,0.97,1322.254,1326.925,Conversations between lawmakers are currently ongoing.,25,,
112,0.97,1326.992,1350.949,Two bills have been introduced last week another bill has a public hearing scheduled as of this morning one Senate bill would Decriminalize possession of drugs.,25,,
113,0.97,1351.016,1367.432,It would establish a legislative Workgroup that would hold public meetings to study the impact of the decision.,25,,
114,0.97,1367.499,1404.636,"Another Senate bill has been introduced, which establishes personal use amounts for controlled substances and removes criminal penalties for possession of controlled substances that don't exceed that personal use amount as established in the state law . It also authorizes law enforcement to refer individuals possessing personal use amount to a forensic navigator for the purpose of evaluation and treatment . This is an approach more focused on referring people to services versus Re- Criminalizing.",25,,
115,0.97,1404.703,1414.146,I think that is all that I have for my report this week.,25,,
116,0.97,1414.212,1434.266,"In safety net and rights, it has a public hearing tomorrow in ways and means . House bill 1078 that restores voter eligibility passed the Senate, 27-22.",26,,

119,0.97,1459.591,1472.137,"The big news is on transportation budgets . I do want to distinguish, these are our current law budgets, which don't assume any new revenue.",27,,
120,0.97,1472.204,1500.298,"They are distinct from what we more commonly referred to as a transportation revenue package, which would be where we would be looking at some substantial new funding for projects . in that context, as Lily mentioned at the beginning, while overall operating revenues have continued to increase since the low point in the summer, transportation revenues have not.",27,,
121,0.97,1500.365,1511.743,"They continue to be down almost, actually more than $1 billion over the current biennium and the next.",27,,
122,0.97,1511.81,1525.523,That was addressed . I guess some progress was made with the decision by the Supreme Court on restoring about $300 million . There was still a substantial shortfall in the budget.,27,,
123,0.97,1525.59,1541.339,Both the house and Senate addressed that by appropriating approximately $1 billion in American rescue plan act funding to Backfill that.,27,,
124,0.97,1541.406,1562.727,"That by and large prevented any significant cuts or delays in projects in both the house and Senate budgets, which is good . We have projects that are funded largely through the 2015 package connecting Washington that we do not want to see delayed.",27,,
125,0.97,1562.794,1567.799,"It does not mean that the budget does not include many significant investments, but I think it is worth noting just a handful.",27,,
126,0.97,1567.866,1628.326,"The Senate budget largely directs the small increases in funding that are available to starting a handful of projects around the States, none of which are included in Seattle . It also includes approximately $4.1 million to continue the study of road usage charged by the state as a potential replacement for the gas tax . The House budget includes some increases to funding for Multimodal grants, as well as green transportation grants, approximately $10 million and $15 million for those projects . There are some small differences, but overall, dominantly, a maintenance budget that also meets the obligation of the state to fund fish passage barrier Removals statewide.",27,,
127,0.97,1628.393,1651.516,"The only other update in the Transportations base is House bill 1301, which would allow sound transit to provide alternative fair enforcement, including warnings without citations.",27,,
128,0.97,1651.583,1657.422,That legislation is scheduled for executives possession tomorrow at 1:30.,27,,
129,0.97,1657.489,1658.456,That concludes our presentation.,27,,

140,0.97,1705.136,1718.783,Is there any indication that the Council or our partners need additional assistance in this last leg? or you pretty positive in its passage?,29,,
141,0.97,1718.85,1720.885,There are still some negotiations happening on House bill 1220.,30,,
142,0.97,1720.952,1728.126,"We will certainly let you know . I think right now, we are in an okay position.",30,,

145,0.97,1743.408,1770.969,"I think it is important for the other associations that we are part of, including the Association of Washington state, to help us and others who are supportive of the bill . I think the Councilmembers for their engagement in how we can help . and then, Council President, I do have one more bill I wanted to ask about . Quinn, thank you so much for your correspondence on Senate bill 5354.",31,,
146,0.97,1771.035,1788.186,I am wondering if you might be able to let us know if there is any additional assistance or how the city is weighing in on the Flagger bill to make sure that peace officers are no longer traffic Coordinators.,31,,
147,0.97,1788.253,1794.926,That Senate I believe with a rather robust margin.,32,,
148,0.97,1794.993,1815.013,"We have been supportive of the legislation and, as it has proceeded to the house and questions have come up about how it would be implemented, we have been working to answer those questions for legislators and committee staff and to assuage any concerns that they have.",32,,
149,0.97,1815.079,1820.952,What about X scenario or Y scenario?,32,,
150,0.97,1821.019,1823.922,The bill is scheduled for a committee vote today.,32,,

The only reason that we are not having sufficient funding is that elected officials intentionally wanted to Underfund this program.",43,,
314,0.97,3334.197,3336.366,We are talking about less than $1 million per year.,43,,
315,0.97,3336.433,3346.509,"We have also seen, for example, with New York City, which has the right of counsel, they saw Eviction filings go down by 30% because they know they will have to face a lawyer.",43,,

321,0.97,3397.594,3399.162,This is just an amendment to a clause.,43,,
322,0.97,3399.229,3404.801,It does not appear to change anything substantively.,43,,

333,0.97,3525.321,3544.54,"Moreover, the effective means testing, even the least Invasive ones, is that it writes that service into future events . means testing has been used politically",43,,
334,0.97,3551.514,3586.683,"One reason why and the Democrats were able to destroy welfare in 1996 was because the programs, when they were set up some decades before, were set up with this testing in the first place . throughout the instance of this program, there were wildly false rumors about people abusing it, and these complete Fabrications were used for clients throughout the program . Social Security has endured for almost a century, 86 years, precisely because it is available to everyone, and it is much harder for politicians to divide and conquer because it is universally applicable . that makes it more difficult to dismantle it.",44,,
335,0.97,3586.749,3594.924,This program has stated repeated brazen attempts by Republicans and Democrats to dismantle it.,44,,
336,0.97,3594.991,3608.204,"There are two other amendments, Councilmember Herbert send out clarifying language two weeks ago.",44,,

356,0.97,3850.179,3852.114,It gives them plenty of time to put that together.,46,,
357,0.97,3852.181,3873.869,"So other organizations have the opportunity to participate in providing these legal services after a couple of years, but single organization, I think, doesn't do service to other organizations that might be willing to participate in the services.",46,,

376,0.97,4026.122,4033.796,"Though this bill, itself, is not the funding mechanism, it's important, I thought, that Council include intention in the bill that future funding for this policy be made only to those willing to represent tenants in a courtroom.",52,,
377,0.97,4033.863,4063.025,"Second amendment would require that the organization with whom the city contracts to provide reporting numbers on cases for representation that occurs outside of the initial show cause hearing--just, again, just working to try--in this case, to get data about the types of cases that are taken under the right to Council ordinance.",52,,
378,0.97,4063.092,4085.548,"We know that the most recent year we have data--only 11 cases of nearly 9000 Eviction cases went to trial in King County., but this was before statewide Eviction reform that such a small number of cases went to trial.",52,,

396,0.97,4234.597,4246.909,They had ideas about how to do the study that we were interested in receiving--sort of with a different approach to get us the information.,55,,

402,0.97,4278.874,4283.345,"It looks like, I think, amendment one, two, and four, I will address amendment three, which is my amendment.",57,,
403,0.97,4283.412,4294.723,"So, last Friday, central staff shared amendment with all of you, and it was also published on the revised agenda for today's full city council meeting.",57,,

406,0.97,4318.047,4338.067,"My review also included a review of prior legal opinions on the legislation participating in a two hour executive session on Monday, March 22nd, and conversations with central members to hear your concerns--my office also spoke to various Stakeholders, including leaders within the housing Justice Department and La center which are the two major legal service providers for tenants facing Evictions here in Seattle and across the region.",57,,

408,0.97,4360.923,4378.64,"I thought it would be important to share some of what we learned through the outreach about how these services work in practice, that might benefit both the public conversation and our ongoing debate around this important bill.",57,,
409,0.97,4378.707,4390.686,"Due to the nature of Addictions, most tenants are lower income and cannot afford legal representation.",57,,

411,0.97,4402.03,4416.712,"In other words, for most tenants, access to legal representation and unlawful Detainer actions is largely limited to Accessing services from legal aid organizations like the housing justice project, and the tenant La center.",57,,
412,0.97,4416.779,4438.367,"Organizations like the housing justice project, for example, primarily serve individuals who make 200% of the Federal poverty level, which is $25,760 for a household of one in 2021, or $43,920 for a family of three in 2021.",57,,

416,0.97,4481.41,4493.222,"I was the prime sponsor for 2 of those new ordinances, which included establishing a payment plan for overdue rent and Eviction defense if the nonpayment of rent was due to reduced income because of the pandemic.",57,,

418,0.97,4506.969,4516.411,"So for this reason, I have an amendment for this afternoon's consideration that will make the rights to Council bill workable, while still creating an opportunity for Renters to access legal aid.",57,,

421,0.97,4538.734,4552.514,"This standard is modeled on the same exact standard utilized in the immigrant legal defense Fund, which was unanimously adopted by the city council in 2016.",57,,

In other words, today, progressive Democrats have a chance to pass a strong law without any means testing to help set a precedent that we can pass laws, and we should be passing laws, that are unambiguously in favor of people who are the most marginalized, and that we make these laws the most immune to dismantling in the future by making them available universally so we can prevent a divide and conquer.",58,,
