31,0.97,100.133,117.45,"Thank you for having us this morning, I know you're usually with our state team, so humor is a little bit without Federal updates, we are trying to come in and meet with you all quarterly, but thought that this was a great opportunity to start off the new year in this new Congress, talking about some of the changes that have been made.",21,,
32,0.97,117.45,119.385,"Leslie, our Federal lobbyists will introduce herself as well.",21,,
33,0.97,119.385,120.887,Most of you have met her.,21,,

35,0.97,136.402,136.803,Terrific.,22,,

37,0.97,144.177,146.312,"Hopefully you can all see them, are they up?",22,,
38,0.97,146.312,147.08,Perfect.,22,,
39,0.97,147.08,148.581,Thank you.,22,,
40,0.97,148.581,151.718,Next slide.,22,,
41,0.97,151.718,159.392,"So, very happy to be with you in truly a new day in Washington DC.",22,,
42,0.97,159.392,160.026,"Very, very exciting.",22,,
43,0.97,160.026,190.957,"Just to Recap, where we were in December, and December, Congress passed hr 133, which was fy 2021 package, that was a $2.4 trillion of package, 6000 page bill, that included fy 21 appropriations, so all the Federal funding for this fiscal year, along with a $900 billion Coronavirus relief bill.",22,,
44,0.97,190.957,206.439,"The water resources development act authorization, a package extending a number of tax breaks, called the tax Extenders package, and the energy act of 2020.",22,,
45,0.97,206.439,214.08,"And I'm going to focus just for a quick moment, really, on the Coronavirus relief package, as I mentioned, it was quite a large bill, 6000 pages.",22,,
46,0.97,214.08,217.517,It would be a lot to Delve into if we were to do the whole thing.,22,,
47,0.97,217.517,222.889,"But, next slide.",22,,
48,0.97,222.889,256.956,"So just some of the highlights from $900 billion Coronavirus relief package, that came through really touching on a number of areas, you know, I think if you've all seen in the media, you know, $600 checks for individuals an additional round of Ppp, including some targeted funds for arts Venues, that I know are going to be really important to the city of Seattle . 8.75 billion for vaccine development and distribution, 22.4 million for contract excuse me, contact tracing.",22,,
49,0.97,256.956,262.629,"And I think one of the pieces to note about this package, is that, unlike the C.A.R.E.S.",22,,
50,0.97,262.629,277.51,"Act, which really included quite a bit of direct funding for our cities, and in particular, the city of Seattle, this package is less helpful to the city specifically, more helpful to the individuals within it.",22,,
51,0.97,277.51,283.516,"That is what they were able to achieve bipartisan resolution on, and bipartisan compromise on.",22,,
52,0.97,283.516,292.558,"And so, you know, I think sometimes some folks have been surprised to not see quite as much funding coming out to the city.",22,,
53,0.97,292.558,293.192,"Next slide, please.",22,,
54,0.97,293.192,318.885,"One area where there is direct funding is around emergency rental assistance, and housing, and then of course there is a new program, a $638 million program that Seattle public utilities was really involved in helping to advocate and push for, that is providing emergency assistance for Low- income households, for drinking water and wastewater assistance.",22,,
55,0.97,318.885,322.188,Next slide.,22,,
56,0.97,322.188,363.763,"So of course, now with President Biden and vice president Harris Inauguration, we are, we have another opportunity, as you heard, by President Biden's say when he was President elect Biden, that he viewed that December plan as really a down payment on additional assistance, and shortly before he was sworn in, he releases $1.9 trillion American rescue plan, which really has kind of three major categories of proposals . One around Healthcare until the 19 response, one around providing additional response for American workers and families, and then support for small businesses and governments.",22,,
57,0.97,363.763,368.367,"And while his plan includes some executive actions, a lot of this is going to depend on congressional legislation.",22,,
58,0.97,368.367,391.958,"And so there is been an early debate happening, about whether or not they should attempt to try to move this on a bipartisan basis, as President Biden said he would like, or if they should use a somewhat arcane procedure, called budget reconciliation, which for our purposes, I think the important thing to note is, it would allow Congress to move legislation with a simple majority.",22,,
59,0.97,391.958,397.23,You get a limited number of Bytes at the apple with budget reconciliation.,22,,
60,0.97,397.23,406.272,"And so, you know, the President and his team need to be really selective about when they want Congress to use this.",22,,
61,0.97,406.272,426.092,"I think at this point, based on conversations that have been on the hill over the weekend, it really looks like I think Democrats are going to forgo trying to do something on a bipartisan basis . They haven't quite said that publicly yet, but looks like they are probably going to skip that step.",22,,
62,0.97,426.092,427.527,And they will move straight to reconciliation.,22,,
63,0.97,427.527,436.803,"Reconciliation is normally a process that actually takes a while and can be very cumbersome in the Senate, and in Congress.",22,,
64,0.97,436.803,452.285,"Now, majority leader Schumer is saying that he is going to try to move a reconciliation package within the next week excuse me, next month to six weeks, which is lightning speed for Congress, and lightning speed for budget reconciliation.",22,,
65,0.97,452.285,457.924,"But again, they are really committed to try to get a very, very comprehensive package through.",22,,
66,0.97,457.924,461.694,"Next slide, please.",22,,
67,0.97,461.694,479.779,"So all the, while the package is likely to shift somewhat from what President Biden proposed, it is likely to include significant funding for state and local governments, direct funding.",22,,
68,0.97,479.779,486.719,"Impact on his plan, he is proposed to do $350 billion in direct funding to stay and locals.",22,,
69,0.97,486.719,508.474,"Maybe that amount changes somewhat, but by using reconciliation, they will avoid having to deal with trying to get bipartisan compromise on state and local funding, which as you can recall, has been a major hang up and trying to get bipartisan legislation for the last time.",22,,
70,0.97,508.474,508.875,Next slide.,22,,
71,0.97,508.875,512.778,Just a couple of the highlights from the plan.,22,,
72,0.97,512.778,535.701,"You know, 50 billion to expand testing, 30 billion for Federal disaster relief, including hundred percent Federal reimbursement for state and local governments, I should note, actually President Biden did an executive order with Federal cost share around FEMA last week, proposing that future FEMA assistance does not have a local cost share, so the Feds would pay for all.",22,,
73,0.97,535.701,539.205,20 billion for national vaccination program.,22,,
74,0.97,539.205,551.918,"As I mentioned already, 350 billion in direct state and local funding, 20 billion for transit, additional funding for education, additional funding for small businesses . next slide, please.",22,,
75,0.97,551.918,566.699,"And you should see the note with the small business funding, really focused on minority owned and small businesses that have been overlooked in the last Ppp round.",22,,
76,0.97,566.699,579.979,"Then, you know, a number of things establishing a $15 per hour Federal minimum wage, extending and expanding emergency paid leave, including ensuring that local governments can receive the payroll tax credit that was provided to provide David sector employees in the C.A.R.E.S.",22,,
77,0.97,579.979,594.927,"Act, additional assistant for individuals, additional pandemic on a Plum entrance, increasing 300 per week benefit that was approved in December, and making that a $400 per week benefit.",22,,
78,0.97,594.927,598.664,"So, really, a huge package.",22,,
79,0.97,598.664,604.07,"There are, as I mentioned, something that may need to fall out, because of the way budget reconciliation works.",22,,
80,0.97,604.07,613.546,"If they are going to use with simple majority procedure, but again, the Trade-Off is, we actually get a major package past.",22,,
81,0.97,613.546,616.983,That includes direct funding for state and local governments.,22,,
82,0.97,616.983,622.588,"Next slide, please.",22,,
83,0.97,622.588,654.32,"Just going through the plan, additional money for rental assistance, additional money for costs for low-income households, extending not only the Cbcs Eviction moratorium, which by the way, president Biden did as part of his executive orders, but then also doing a foreclosure, a foreclosure moratorium, extending snap, extending Childcare support, so really the full Panoply of issues and needs being covered.",22,,
84,0.97,654.32,660.826,Next slide?,22,,
85,0.97,660.826,692.525,"So we are seeing President Biden and vice president Harris move very aggressively on their 100 day agenda they have said that, you know, their mission number one is curbing the spread of Covid-19, and you saw the President and vice president release their Covid-19 plan last week, along with a series of executive orders, aiming to stem the spread of Covid-19, delivering economic assistance to Americans in need, helping to mitigate climate change, and reversing Trump policies on immigration.",22,,
86,0.97,692.525,702.168,"And again, we saw executive orders last week, reinstating --",22,,
87,0.97,702.168,710.943,We may have lost Leslie.,23,,
88,0.97,710.943,714.88,"I'm assuming everyone else is experiencing some difficulty here, Okay, great, not just me.",23,,
89,0.97,714.88,724.256,"If she doesn't come back soon, Council President, we can shift over to the state report, but maybe we will give her a little more time.",24,,
90,0.97,724.256,725.291,Okay.,25,,
91,0.97,725.291,727.159,"Yes, she just dropped off the call here.",26,,
92,0.97,727.159,727.993,Okay.,27,,
93,0.97,727.993,737.203,I can also take a minute to discuss our Federal goals and priorities.,28,,
94,0.97,737.203,737.87,"Thank you, Sierra.",29,,
95,0.97,737.87,739.739,While we wait for her to get back.,30,,
96,0.97,739.739,747.947,"You should've all received in your Emails as well, our final draft of our Federal goals and priorities for 2021 in this new Congress.",30,,
97,0.97,747.947,773.439,"It is pretty representative of, should be representative of the mayors party, and the city at large, so it's very high level, didn't have a lot of room for detail or nuance in it work but I wanted you all to have the opportunity to take a look at it, and if you see any glaring omissions or things that you would like added or have comments on, please do let me know by the end of this week.",30,,
98,0.97,773.439,781.046,It is an external document that we use to just inform our partners on where the city's priorities are.,30,,
99,0.97,781.046,798.33,"And as you can see, I see we have Leslie back, but even what Leslie has presented already, a lot of our goals and priorities have been acknowledged and are represented by the Biden/Harris Ministration in this new package as well.",30,,
100,0.97,798.33,806.739,Is on the right track toward that . But I wanted to give you all the opportunity to review that and see if you had any comments on it.,30,,
101,0.97,806.739,826.325,"Again, it is an Iterative working document, so always have opportunities to make adjustments to it as, you know, this world changes at the Federal level, hopefully we have a little more stability in these next few years, but I will shift back to Leslie now, I think she is back and continue the presentation.",30,,
102,0.97,826.325,827.092,"Rate, that's okay.",31,,
103,0.97,827.092,828.294,"Sorry we lost you, Leslie.",31,,
104,0.97,828.294,828.761,"No, apologies.",32,,
105,0.97,828.761,830.796,Good old technology.,32,,
106,0.97,830.796,836.135,"I think where I was was, I'm not sure when you lost me.",32,,
107,0.97,836.135,843.409,But it was right here.,32,,
108,0.97,843.409,862.728,"Okay, so using lots of executive orders come I think the Biden team has experienced enough to know that, you know, it's the same players that we have dealt with before on the Republican side, and so I think they are going to be very bold and using executive orders next slide.",32,,
109,0.97,862.728,869.435,"So just to give you a number of they want executive orders coming through, really across the board, dealing with the pandemic, dealing with immigration, climate change, rejoining Paris.",32,,
110,0.97,869.435,872.438,Next slide.,32,,
111,0.97,872.438,875.14,"And then of course, the priority has been getting the cabinet through.",32,,
112,0.97,875.14,890.689,"So a number of, he has made his full nominations now for top level for his secretaries, so now we are starting to see some of the deputy secretaries and political appointees coming through.",32,,
113,0.97,890.689,894.36,Next slide?,32,,
114,0.97,894.36,897.029,"Really diverse cabinet, it has been a huge priority for President Biden.",32,,
115,0.97,897.029,909.775,"Next flight York and so last week, we saw director of national intelligence and defense Secretary Lloyd Austin get approved by the Senate.",32,,
116,0.97,909.775,918.083,"You know, today, we will see a vote on Danielle and for can Secretary.",32,,
117,0.97,918.083,927.293,"We will also have additional nominations for HUD, Department of energy, and ambassador to be one, taken up by committees.",32,,
118,0.97,927.293,932.464,"They are moving through these though very, very quickly.",32,,
119,0.97,932.464,954.186,"We know, of course, as you have seen, that the House will transmit the articles of impeachment today, and so the Senate is now saying February 8th is when the impeachment process will begin in the Senate . candidly, I think the Biden team is good with this Timeline, because this gives them time to get there cabinet nominee is through the process as quickly as possible.",32,,
120,0.97,954.186,970.436,"I think leader Schumer is really committed to not having impeachment take up the entire agenda, so they are trying to figure out ways where Maybe the Senate will do some work in the morning and then take up impeachment in the afternoon or vice versa.",32,,
121,0.97,970.436,971.704,"But again, really, really ambitious agenda.",32,,
122,0.97,971.704,979.445,"They're moving really, really aggressively, and I'm more than thrilled to be giving this report now, today, that I would've been three months ago.",32,,
123,0.97,979.445,986.952,So it really does feel like a new day . So I'm happy to take any questions.,32,,
124,0.97,986.952,991.256,"Sorry, again, for technology problems.",32,,
125,0.97,995.694,998.23,Council President?,33,,
126,0.97,998.23,1017.383,"Already, folks, I see several people in the Queue, I heard Councilmember Juarez first, then Councilmember Herbold, and anyone else that might have questions, you can use the raise your hand feature in zoom to help me keep track, that would be super.",34,,
127,0.97,1017.383,1018.384,"All right, thank you.",35,,
128,0.97,1018.384,1020.753,Sorry I didn't use the raise your hand feature.,35,,
129,0.97,1020.753,1023.489,"That's all right, I hadn't said it.",36,,
130,0.97,1023.489,1024.289,I hadn't set it.,36,,
131,0.97,1024.289,1025.557,"Leslie, good to see you.",37,,
132,0.97,1025.557,1027.726,"Nice to see you, happy new year.",38,,
133,0.97,1027.726,1037.97,"So our big concern, not just me, but all of Indian country, is the hold on representative Holland from the representative Congressman out of Minnesota.",39,,
134,0.97,1037.97,1049.715,"So, I've been on all these calls, so is there any update more that you know of, what's going to happen with that for her to be confirmed as Secretary of interior?",39,,
135,0.97,1049.715,1053.619,The first native American.,39,,
136,0.97,1053.619,1055.721,"Yes, I don't have, let me check on that.",40,,
137,0.97,1055.721,1070.002,"When I had last heard, I still think she is going to be confirmed, you know, obstacles notwithstanding, but I'm happy to find an exact Timeline for you when she is going and what they think the process will be.",40,,
138,0.97,1070.002,1073.505,"That would be great, thank you.",41,,
139,0.97,1073.505,1076.141,"Thank you Council member Juarez, Councilmember Herbold, please?",42,,
140,0.97,1076.141,1082.347,"Think you, just two quick questions, first relates to the testing and vaccine plan.",43,,
141,0.97,1082.347,1143.008,"You mentioned that the plan itself includes about $30 billion for this purpose, I believe this plan was passed back in December, and I'm just wondering whether or not there is a recognition on the part of the Biden administration, that this number might need to be Revisited, in light of the administration's goal of 100 million vaccines administered in 100 days, whether or not that $30 billion needs to be adjusted . and Secondly, as it relates to the $14 billion for transit and $10 billion for highways, do we have any information about how that will be allocated, and given that this is considered part of the Coronavirus relief package, I don't believe it is part of a, and infrastructure package, it's focus on relief.",43,,
142,0.97,1143.008,1154.887,"I'm just wondering how those funds will be allocated, and whether or not there is any eligibility to address our Seattle bridge or sound transit light rail third-party class?",43,,
143,0.97,1154.887,1157.422,Thank you.,43,,
144,0.97,1157.422,1170.736,"Yeah, so on the vaccine, the administration is hearing loud and clear from everyone about the massive need for additional funding for a vaccine.",44,,
145,0.97,1170.736,1182.648,And the funding that was approved in December is being really administered through these public health cooperative agreements that they have in place.,44,,
146,0.97,1182.648,1190.055,"Their goal was really, because they are trying to get the money out fast, they've been trying to avoid having just to Re-Create new structures and using existing formulas.",44,,
147,0.97,1190.055,1202.367,"The challenge, of course, means that most of that money, for the December package, went through the States, and basically four very, very large counties.",44,,
148,0.97,1202.367,1204.336,"La County, Washington DC, Chicago, New York.",44,,
149,0.97,1204.336,1208.874,"And so, I will give the Biden team credit.",44,,
150,0.97,1208.874,1231.196,"They've been doing a number of calls with cities directly to hear from them about, what could they do to partner more effectively to get vaccines out, and I think as part of that, they are hearing the message that there may need to be more funding, as well as the need to not only work through the States, and the counties, but to work directly with cities as well.",44,,
151,0.97,1231.196,1232.664,I think that's definitely part of it.,44,,
152,0.97,1232.664,1242.708,"On transportation, it is, those funds were distributed on transit sides, either urbanized area formula, essentially the same formula they have used for Carers.",44,,
153,0.97,1242.708,1256.421,"It primarily for operation and as you said, not really in and for structure package, really just on the loss and stem the bleeding that some of our transit these are facing right now.",44,,
154,0.97,1256.421,1284.082,"That said, I do want to mention, on West Seattle bridge, and some of our transit projects, the Trump administration, on their very last day in office, released the build for a grant no photos, those have been clawed back, because they obviously do not reflect this admission rations priorities, but the Ministration, the Biden team said they want to get those, that money out as quickly as possible.",44,,
155,0.97,1284.082,1291.857,"So they are really committed to Reformulating those to ensure that they, you know, neither priorities? around climate, around equity, etc.",44,,
156,0.97,1291.857,1295.594,But those beating the ground and with the other bridge may be a very good candidate for those.,44,,
157,0.97,1295.594,1305.37,"The other piece too, the Biden administration has said, as you noted, they really want to get an infrastructure plan in place.",44,,
158,0.97,1305.37,1311.877,"And that is communal, as soon as they get the Coronavirus package through, they will turn their attention to that infrastructure package.",44,,

164,0.97,1342.207,1353.785,"So if we are able to get direct and local state funding, I believe some of that was being used with a virus relief funds that have an approved in the C.A.R.E.S.",48,,
165,0.97,1353.785,1353.985,Act.,48,,
166,0.97,1353.985,1362.627,"So I believe that an additional allocation of direct funding would help ensure that we could continue that program, but we can double check on that.",48,,
167,0.97,1362.627,1364.329,I believe that that is the case though.,48,,
168,0.97,1364.329,1366.565,"Thank you, I would appreciate the follow up by Email.",49,,

172,0.97,1385.217,1386.384,Sardis have one remaining question.,51,,
173,0.97,1386.384,1397.596,"It's about the foreclosure moratorium, and this is something you can get back to us on, is that just for mortgages insured by the Federal housing and Ministration?",51,,
174,0.97,1397.596,1412.744,"Or is that also Impacting mortgages backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and then also a moratorium on foreclosures for those not backed by FHA, Fannie or Freddie?",51,,
175,0.97,1412.744,1420.619,Let get back to you on exactly to make sure we are saying and giving you exactly the right information.,52,,

179,0.97,1428.093,1451.216,"Sorry, my question was also about how mortgages would be affected here, I want to make sure, as we got Evictions looming, that we are, you know, doing everything we can to protect our Renters, and also knowing that our small landlords are struggling, because they are not collecting rent.",56,,
180,0.97,1451.216,1457.823,So it would be helpful to get that information.,56,,
181,0.97,1457.823,1465.63,"Thanks, to both of you, for thinking of that question, really appreciate it.",57,,
182,0.97,1465.63,1471.636,Any other questions or comments for Leslie or Sierra?,57,,

185,0.97,1476.675,1485.684,"I just wanted to put it back, first off, I'm looking much more forward to these Federal briefings now in this admission rations.",60,,
186,0.97,1485.684,1533.164,"But I'm looking forward, because I know that when we met, you know, in person last year that is how we know how long ago it was, and talked a little bit about conversations and Congress around and infrastructure plan, which you alluded to a little, in answering Council number Herbold's question, is there an Indicatin yet in what the Timeline for that might be, and what the focus of that might be, that we can glean this early in the process, knowing that that will, you know, probably GEL down the road, but things we can do to me the influence that process and get Seattle priorities kind of baked into the shape of what that infrastructure bill looks like, that's something I would be very interested in.",60,,
187,0.97,1533.164,1540.305,"So just Maybe if you have a few more thoughts to expand on that, conceding that it is still early.",60,,
188,0.97,1540.305,1540.772,"No, absolutely.",61,,
189,0.97,1540.772,1542.974,I think it's a great question.,61,,
190,0.97,1542.974,1553.485,"So, part of it, of course, the Timeline is going to depend on how long it takes the Coronavirus relief package to actually get through them recognizing that they are trying to do a really ambitious Timeframe.",61,,
191,0.97,1553.485,1560.792,"They will also, the Biden administration is likely to release something.",61,,
192,0.97,1560.792,1566.097,"They've that in the coming weeks, so they are very committed to try to move something quickly as well.",61,,
193,0.97,1566.097,1576.741,"Recognizing that it's going to be a core part of how we bring about economic recovery . and that is going to be very, very climate driven.",61,,
194,0.97,1576.741,1584.349,"And so we expect to see Camino, sort of a real climate lens and also an equity lens, applied to their priorities.",61,,
195,0.97,1584.349,1597.262,"One starting place, and the House leadership has alluded to this, is the moving America forward act, with the House packs passed last summer.",61,,
196,0.97,1597.262,1598.73,That's a very comprehensive piece of legislation.,61,,
197,0.97,1598.73,1603.335,It starts with surface transportation reauthorization but then a number of energy and climate related issues.,61,,
198,0.97,1603.335,1606.538,Includes Broadband investment.,61,,
199,0.97,1606.538,1617.349,"And that is an area that we, you know, we've been looking at with city departments, to identify, you know, what do we like in there, and what's missing?",61,,
200,0.97,1617.349,1618.249,What we need to amplify?,61,,
201,0.97,1618.249,1619.684,What Apps do we need to fill?,61,,
202,0.97,1619.684,1626.191,"So we've been looking really closely at that, but that is a place, that is where I think the House will probably start their efforts as well.",61,,
203,0.97,1626.191,1633.598,And they will try to these that with the Biden plan.,61,,
204,0.97,1633.598,1634.399,"Great, thank you.",62,,

298,0.97,2415.379,2417.114,A couple of updates in the environmental space.,92,,
299,0.97,2417.114,2419.483,"Last week, there were hearings on the governor's climate commitment act 5126.",92,,
300,0.97,2419.483,2433.597,"As well as the governor's healthy homes clean buildings 1084, both of those attracted sort of, as you would expect for high-profile legislation, a wide range of thoughts and opinions and public comments were monitoring them closely.",92,,
301,0.97,2433.597,2452.316,"And believe we expect that the sponsors of the legislative sponsors of both bills are working on proposed substitutes to incorporate some of the feedback that they have heard, so looking forward to those, potentially later this week, or the following week.",92,,
302,0.97,2452.316,2465.863,"There will be a committee vote this week on 1075, which is the Tmc emission reduction legislation . I think we might see some small changes there, but nothing significant.",92,,
303,0.97,2465.863,2474.271,"And then Finally, the clean build standard House bill 1091 was voted out of committee.",92,,
304,0.97,2474.271,2508.272,"There was a proposed substitute that makes sort of an array of, I was a technical, but complex changes around the impacts to electric utilities, and we are working with our wonderful electric utility to understand those specific impacts for us, but, you know, largely, Seattle city light would be a beneficiary of the standard and given the sponsor of the legislation, I don't expect any of these changes would be of significant concern to us.",92,,
305,0.97,2508.272,2509.74,But happy to report back on that.,92,,
306,0.97,2509.74,2513.344,And I will pause therefore questions.,92,,
307,0.97,2513.344,2522.686,"Colleagues, any questions on this section?",93,,
308,0.97,2522.686,2523.954,Looks like we can keep going.,93,,
309,0.97,2523.954,2526.39,"All right, moving on to general government, a few updates here.",94,,
310,0.97,2526.39,2545.209,"House bill 1016, you may recall, this bill was introduced last year and ultimately didn't make it, but establishing Juneteenth as a legal holiday, this was voted out of committee last Wednesday, so it will move to the House floor, obviously monitoring closely and looking for opportunities to support.",94,,
311,0.97,2545.209,2567.431,"House bill 1056 is the legislation that essentially makes permanent the changes that were or the temporary changes that were made to the open public meetings requirements and Online meetings through the governor's proclamation, so for any future declared emergencies, we would have a set of regulations in place.",94,,
312,0.97,2567.431,2578.609,"The current regulations have already been standardized for the duration of the emergency, but for any future emergencies, we would have this framework.",94,,
313,0.97,2578.609,2584.748,"The House passed that with a 98- 0 vote, so it's got a strong path over toward the Senate.",94,,
314,0.97,2584.748,2592.256,"Hopefully we can see that adopted, so we have some certainty moving forward.",94,,
315,0.97,2592.256,2616.88,"One built a flag, that was just introduced in the time between our last briefing is House bill 1258, which is the Micro enterprise home kitchen .

316,0.97,2616.88,2641.972,"Then Finally, a flag, Senate bill 5061, which modifies the women insurance program to ensure that individuals who are high risk, or who live with someone who is high risk, who voluntarily quit their job during a public health emergency, if they can't work from home, qualify for women insurance.",94,,

319,0.97,2646.71,2652.483,"There were a few Republicans in support, but continuing to track that as it moves to the Senate floor.",94,,
320,0.97,2652.483,2657.021,I will pause there around general government for any questions.,94,,
321,0.97,2657.021,2661.925,"Any questions or comments, colleagues?",95,,
322,0.97,2661.925,2683.647,"I appreciate the Legislature's response to the open public meetings act issues, we've been having regular contact with the governor's office around a lot of those issues and I think it helps us continue to do our business and the safest way possible, consistent with the governor's orders.",95,,
323,0.97,2683.647,2686.65,So hopefully we can Continu to be supportive of those efforts.,95,,
324,0.97,2686.65,2690.921,Absolutely.,96,,

347,0.97,2939.803,2964.328,"And in many ways, the compounding stressors of Covid just causing people to look for additional ways to relieve stress . We will continue to fight to make sure we get the funding that we need and our state legislators, and as we heard as well, from the Federal partners, mental health and substance abuse funding has dramatically decreased over the last few decades, and I'm optimistic that we can get additional support.",99,,
348,0.97,2964.328,2977.941,"Just calling out the public health crisis that is driving some of the legislation, so people know we are paying attention, and that we, I think we will be good partners in deploying these resources Asap.",99,,

352,0.97,3011.541,3041.705,"In King County, in Seattle, math continues to be a leading driver for deaths as well, and just wondering if there is any conversations at the state Legislature around addressing that particular, you know, particular interventions for that particular substance use and illness.",101,,

354,0.97,3048.378,3052.015,Is an important piece of this is well.,102,,
355,0.97,3052.015,3070.2,"Yeah, I think it's really important to make sure our state let a slate of partners, in addition to advancing the work are also giving us local jurisdictions, the flex ability to address other prevalent types of substances that are resulting in increased levels of death within our communities.",103,,
356,0.97,3070.2,3082.345,So I think Meth is right up there and I think I seem to recall the information that the public health board sent to us highlighted that as an issue.,103,,
357,0.97,3082.345,3104.568,"Another was an article over the weekend in the Seattle times that talked about that nuance, in terms of some of the Federal funding and priorities we are seeing from the Biden/Harris Ministration, and how there may be some gaps as it relates to how substance abuse plays out in our local community here in King County.",103,,
358,0.97,3104.568,3110.941,"So would love to continue to have conversations about that and make sure we are lifting up that need as well with the Legislature, to ensure those needs will be met.",103,,
359,0.97,3110.941,3111.875,Definitely.,104,,

363,0.97,3119.783,3122.786,I have a question about the bill 5209.,106,,
364,0.97,3122.786,3178.408,"Do you know, or is there any conversation happening around expanding these crisis Hotlines, suicide prevention services, or really just mental health services that are culturally Approprite? and I ask, because there are a lot of folks in South Seattle, South King County, particularly right now anyway, in the East African community, who are looking for mental health services that are culturally relevant . and I, they are really struggling to find ways to provide access to services that are responsive to people who don't speak English as a first language, or who just come from, you know, different communities, different cultures, and who still need appropriate mental health services.",106,,
365,0.97,3178.408,3187.417,So I'm interested to know if this bill or if there are other bills that might be addressing that need in our communities.,106,,
366,0.97,3187.417,3194.024,I'm happy to follow up with you on the specifics of that.,107,,
367,0.97,3194.024,3200.63,"I know they are looking to make them Community-Based, but the point very well take on the language, and the needs specifically of some of the community members in Seattle.",107,,
368,0.97,3200.63,3202.432,So I'm happy to follow-up and advocate for that.,107,,
369,0.97,3202.432,3206.77,Thank you.,108,,
370,0.97,3206.77,3207.671,Great.,109,,

372,0.97,3208.171,3209.973,Let's keep going.,109,,
373,0.97,3209.973,3214.978,We have about 10 minutes left here.,109,,
374,0.97,3214.978,3219.683,I believe housing is the next item.,110,,
375,0.97,3219.683,3221.785,I'm going to be real brief on this section today.,110,,
376,0.97,3221.785,3241.204,"I know many of you are interested in how we provide tenant protections as the Eviction moratorium, both at the state and local levels may come to an end and just letting you know, I monitoring those, but nothing substantial happened with those bills this week.",110,,
377,0.97,3241.204,3261.224,"Did want to highlight, House bill 1277 and Senate bill 5279, which is on the top of page 7, that would make a $100 increase in the document recording fees and raise at least $100 million, and probably a little bit more on the given the number of housing transactions that are happening right now.",110,,
378,0.97,3261.224,3265.295,"That will be mostly focused on rent assistance, at least in the first biennium.",110,,
379,0.97,3265.295,3272.636,It had a hearing last Friday in the house and is scheduled for executive session this week.,110,,
380,0.97,3272.636,3277.14,"If there are no questions on housing, I can immediately just shift to police reform.",110,,
381,0.97,3277.14,3280.143,"Any questions, colleagues?",111,,
382,0.97,3280.143,3283.146,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please?",111,,
383,0.97,3283.146,3296.96,"Thank you so much, Robin, this, just barely very briefly, can you point us to any of the legislation we should be tracking that includes additional assistance or push towards strategic acquisition opportunities?",112,,
384,0.97,3296.96,3311.775,"Yes, actually, that bill, council member, Mosqueda, thank you for asking is 1070. that would Gibson County the ability through the health through housing sales tax to acquire buildings.",113,,
385,0.97,3311.775,3317.147,"We are following that, that actually has a hearing today.",113,,
386,0.97,3317.147,3324.354,"We signed and in favor of it, had a very nice sweep of supporters from all around King County, and many suburban cities.",113,,
387,0.97,3324.354,3330.894,And I apologize that it didn't get into the bulletin.,113,,
388,0.97,3330.894,3334.164,"We will make sure it is in there next week, so you can track its progress.",113,,
389,0.97,3334.164,3334.798,No problem.,114,,
390,0.97,3334.798,3365.028,"Thanks so much, colleagues, the Seattle housing authority provided a quick addition in my committee last week, just wanted to flag this is an excellent opportunity for us to engage in strategic acquisition, especially as we look at two, three, four bedroom opportunities that are coming onto the market and for local jurisdiction to be able to purchase those, it's really great way for us to preserve affordable housing, but also to make more housing available and is a win win for those small building owners who might have a situation, given the economic crisis.",114,,
391,0.97,3365.028,3378.541,"Huge opportunity, glad they are helping to support, and thanks to the chair of our regional housing effort for helping to make sure this is on folks radar and looking forward to supporting in any way, Robin.",114,,
392,0.97,3378.541,3378.875,Thanks.,114,,
393,0.97,3378.875,3380.61,Thank you.,115,,
394,0.97,3380.61,3386.349,Now I just will switch on to police reform.,115,,
395,0.97,3386.349,3388.818,There's over 20 bills at the Legislature right now on police reform.,115,,
396,0.97,3388.818,3391.254,So it's a bit staggering to track all of them.,115,,
397,0.97,3391.254,3395.925,I just wanted to point to a couple of things are happening this week.,115,,
398,0.97,3395.925,3398.595,There is a new use of force bill that was dropped last week.,115,,
399,0.97,3398.595,3404.634,"House bill 1310 by representative Johnson, that creates a reasonable care standard for when officers may use force.",115,,
400,0.97,3404.634,3407.67,That bill is being heard on Friday.,115,,
401,0.97,3407.67,3428.958,"The independent investigations bill, which is the governor's task force recommendations on creating a state centralized agency to do investigation, when force is used, that have a hearing tomorrow, and how's public safety . so that is a very important bill.",115,,
402,0.97,3428.958,3430.794,Of course we are keeping an eye on that.,115,,
403,0.97,3430.794,3439.602,"And also, this week, there will be house built 1203, sorry, I'm skipping around a little bit, has a hearing tomorrow also.",115,,
404,0.97,3439.602,3448.678,"We are just monitoring that bill, because we want to make sure that our accountability ordinance is aligned with whatever that bill may recommend when it comes out of committee.",115,,
405,0.97,3448.678,3450.88,So does keeping a close eye on that one.,115,,
406,0.97,3450.88,3456.853,"That is my presentation on police reform, if anyone has questions?",115,,
407,0.97,3456.853,3462.325,"Colleagues, any comments or questions, Councilmember Pedersen, please?",116,,
408,0.97,3462.325,3468.932,"Thank you, Council President.",117,,
409,0.97,3468.932,3474.037,"Question is about a couple of different bills, trying to figure out which one is stronger on police reform.",117,,
410,0.97,3474.037,3493.723,"So it would seem that Senator Solomon's bill SB 5134 is stronger on police accountability than SB 5055, because SB 5134 gets rid of the arbitration of the appeal process that has historically allowed bad cops to reinstate into their jobs.",117,,
411,0.97,3493.723,3499.262,Are you Foreseeing some sort of reconciliation between those two bills?,117,,
412,0.97,3499.262,3506.169,Or one succeeding over the other?,117,,
413,0.97,3506.169,3533.897,"We are certainly advocating for some, at the very least, if a bill does not move forward, that eliminates arbitration for a bill that would put some Guardrails around arbitration, so we are actively advocating for that, and, you know, we are hopeful that either a new vehicle could be introduced, or that there would be an amendment to one of those bills in the committee.",118,,
414,0.97,3533.897,3537.567,Thank you.,119,,
415,0.97,3537.567,3541.304,"Colleagues, any other questions?",120,,
416,0.97,3541.304,3542.672,"Council member Herbold, please.",120,,
417,0.97,3542.672,3641.871,"A little bit more information as relates to Council member Pedersen's question, just to be 100% clear, myself and Mayor Durkin find in favor of both bills when we give testimony, the week before last, and I concur with Robin's statements, the bill that should move forward is one that I think allows Seattle the flexibility to pursue significant reforms in arbitration, if not get rid of arbitration altogether, and there are additional things that, for the bill to move forward, we should continue to advocate for the short list of items that the Mayor's office and myself have been promoting, together with Oir, and discussing directly with our state legislators . and then as it relates to be John's bill, sometimes known as the ACLU bill, if that vehicle doesn't move forward, because it eliminates arbitration, there's a lot in that bill that should move forward, and I really hope that the sponsors and the Stakeholders, you know, really go through that ACLU bill, because I think there are some things that Stakeholders you don't agree about getting rid of arbitration, can agree about in that bill.",121,,
418,0.97,3641.871,3664.227,"And again, I've got sort of a Shortlist of things that I would be happy to share with you, Councilmember Pedersen, as it relates to, let's not just throw the baby out with the Bathwater, let's figure out how to, as you say, some reconciliation with the bill.",121,,
419,0.97,3664.227,3677.54,"I do have a question about one of the bills coming up this week, specifically the bill related to police oversight.",122,,
420,0.97,3677.54,3707.07,"There is the 1203, I understand in a large part, it combines the functions of the OPA and Oig, and just, there is language that says any community oversight board must comply by January 1st, 2020, with the requirements of the bill, but there's language that says, except when full compliance would violate a Federal consent decree.",122,,
421,0.97,3707.07,3726.689,"Is not intended to sort of give Seattle the flexibility to maintain our own current Oversights structure that has, you know, the three legs with civilians leaving each of the three legs?",122,,
422,0.97,3726.689,3748.611,"It does, exactly, I think that's what it's intended to do although we do have some concern, because in the event that the consent decree is no longer in effect, then we want to make sure that we have some additional language that would, you know, make sure that we are not needing to overhaul our accountability system, once the consent decree is left in.",123,,
423,0.97,3748.611,3751.748,So we are looking into that and make sure there is alignment there.,123,,
424,0.97,3751.748,3756.419,Thank you.,124,,
425,0.97,3756.419,3757.22,"Great, thank you.",125,,
426,0.97,3757.22,3759.922,Any other questions or comments?,125,,

428,0.97,3764.827,3777.507,"Just wanted to quickly highlight, there is quite a big hearing today, on the public safety field, Senate bill 5078, which is at the bottom of page 10.",126,,
429,0.97,3777.507,3784.881,"That would ban High-Capacity magazines of more than 10 rounds, and that is being heard this morning in the Senate justice committee.",126,,

431,0.97,3795.057,3803.065,There is a hearing on Tuesday in the House civil rights and it is very committee and chief Diaz is going to be Testifying in support of that bill.,126,,
432,0.97,3803.065,3809.806,"Finally, there is a civil protection order bill, which is House bill 1320 and Senate bill 5297.",126,,
433,0.97,3809.806,3821.417,This Aligns and simplifies the six different types of protection orders that we have in Washington state . a lot of work over the summer went into some very technical legislation to create this alignment.,126,,
434,0.97,3821.417,3825.922,Then they have a hearing this Wednesday on civil rights and Judiciary Committee.,126,,
435,0.97,3825.922,3827.39,That was all they had.,126,,

438,0.97,3835.998,3836.299,All right.,127,,
439,0.97,3836.299,3838.0,Does that take us through the full presentation?,127,,
440,0.97,3838.0,3840.102,Or do we have a couple more?,127,,
441,0.97,3840.102,3842.905,Do we have a couple more we have to wrap up?,127,,
442,0.97,3842.905,3849.011,"Really quickly, I will go to safety net and civil rights, just a couple here.",128,,
443,0.97,3849.011,3851.914,"One is Senate bill 5023, that is child care eligibility and unemployment benefits.",128,,
444,0.97,3851.914,3866.929,"And not just Brevets the Department of children youth and family strong County and any Covid related on appointment benefits, when determining eligibility for the Copayment, for working connections Childcare.",128,,
445,0.97,3866.929,3878.241,"And one more to flag, way down at the bottom, a new bill by Senator when.",128,,
446,0.97,3878.241,3886.949,"Senate bill 5214, and what that does is really expands back before the Prerecession, a lot of the old requirements were changed.",128,,
447,0.97,3886.949,3911.774,"This is working to expand, extend beyond 60 months, for those who need it, and increase the earned income set aside, allowing families to save a lot more of their income, rather than be excluded, based on that, and establishes telephone orientations, reducing that barrier for folks needing to attend in person.",128,,
448,0.97,3911.774,3920.983,"So that is it on safety net, and then I think Quinn has one quick transportation, knowing that we are right at that time.",128,,
449,0.97,3920.983,3948.311,"Yes, understanding that we are basically at our time here, I would just note that, representative, and her chair of the House of Representatives, release a framework for his package last week, as you alluded to, there were not specific projects to benefit at this point however, anticipate that it was built out as negotiations unfold, in the house on the Senate.",129,,
450,0.97,3948.311,3956.952,"We expect Senator Chavez will be releasing an update of his proposal, in the next week, most likely.",129,,
451,0.97,3956.952,3959.922,"That too, we have heard, is unlikely to include a project list.",129,,
452,0.97,3959.922,3975.538,"Legislatures are holding their cards close to their chest and keeping points of negotiation open . We look forward to seeing what that entails, but Similarly, have heard that there will not likely be a project list.",129,,
453,0.97,3975.538,3994.523,"In the interest of time, I'm not going to go through all of the details of representative package, but I will send out an Email summary to all the Councilmembers, and I'm happy to follow-up with anyone who is interested.",129,,
454,0.97,3994.523,3995.858,"Great, thank you so much, Quinn.",130,,

465,0.97,4045.007,4065.127,"We do have Karina with us this morning, she will be here to make just a quick presentation on Council member Mosqueda's hazard pay legislation, and then we will go ahead and hear from Councilmember Mosqueda on her legislation in that order.",132,,
466,0.97,4065.127,4075.204,"So we will go ahead and wait for Karina to take you up until we get to Council member Mosqueda's report, which is the third report this morning.",132,,
467,0.97,4075.204,4080.309,"For now, we will go ahead and start Council member Lewis, then hear from Councilmember Morales.",132,,
468,0.97,4080.309,4081.877,"Thank you, Madam President.",133,,
469,0.97,4081.877,4095.558,"Appreciate, first, the opportunity to hear from the Federal delegation this morning, or Federal lobbying delegation, it is just so encouraging to really be in a new world of partnership.",133,,
470,0.97,4095.558,4097.76,With the other Washington.,133,,
471,0.97,4097.76,4108.237,There are no items on this afternoon's agenda from the select Committee on homelessness strategies and investments.,133,,
472,0.97,4108.237,4116.278,"I do look forward to voting this afternoon on the hazard pay, for grocery workers.",133,,
473,0.97,4116.278,4135.998,"I was in my local grocery store the other day, and have a great pleasure of seeing a checker wearing a sticker advocating for the campaign, so good job you have Cw, really appreciate the solidarity and all the hard work that our mothers and sisters in labor have put into ringing this proposal forward.",133,,
474,0.97,4135.998,4147.71,"And I was proud to cosponsor this legislation last week in the Finance Committee, and look forward to voting for it on final passage today.",133,,
475,0.97,4147.71,4160.322,"As is foreshadowed, and yesterday's column, my office will be kicking off an effort this afternoon, to ambitiously scaled tiny House villages in 2021.",133,,
476,0.97,4160.322,4174.57,"This collaborative effort, between business, nonprofit, providers, and neighborhood Stakeholders, will lead to a surge of tiny houses, to finally give a Scalable offer of sheltered to our neighbors expensing homelessness.",133,,
477,0.97,4174.57,4181.443,And this has been no more urgent than a week where we anticipate potential snowfall.,133,,
478,0.97,4181.443,4196.859,"2021 can be the year that we come together as a city government, to solve the crisis of our homelessness emergency with four walls and a door that locks, as my colleague counsel mentor Strauss often says.",133,,
479,0.97,4196.859,4216.145,"It's the year that we recognize common interest in providing people, living in tents, a safe, Hygienic, and warm place to live, what we do the hard work at the same time, of Scaling permanent supportive housing, and other housing based initiatives to respond to the crisis of homelessness.",133,,
480,0.97,4216.145,4223.886,Only that permanent supportive housing or permanent housing can truly solve homelessness.,133,,
481,0.97,4223.886,4226.655,"Shelter options, like tiny houses, and hotels, are only a temporary living situation.",133,,
482,0.97,4226.655,4238.901,"This crisis cannot wait until we have realized the five year or longer goal, of Scaling Herman in support of housing regionally.",133,,
483,0.97,4238.901,4240.502,People don't need shelter in the long run.,133,,
484,0.97,4240.502,4245.007,People need shelter right now.,133,,
485,0.97,4245.007,4270.833,"I will be sharing more details on this initiative at noon, where I will be joined by representatives from the housing Institute, the downtown Seattle Association, the South Lake Union Chamber of Commerce, and other Stakeholders who have pledged private resources to get this effort support, and working with everyone on the counsel over this year, to join in our shared goal of Scaling all sorts of shelter options, including tiny houses.",133,,
486,0.97,4270.833,4292.755,"So with that, I think I will leave the rest of it until after briefing, and my press event at noon, but I appreciate the ability to share that, appreciate Danny Wesley sort of getting the ball rolling on it with favorable coverage yesterday in this column.",133,,
487,0.97,4292.755,4305.367,And really look forward to 2021 being a year where we boldly respond to our homelessness crisis in Seattle.,133,,
488,0.97,4305.367,4307.369,"With that, I have no further updates, Madam President.",133,,
489,0.97,4307.369,4308.47,Thank you Council member Lewis.,134,,
490,0.97,4308.47,4310.673,Any comments or questions on that report?,134,,
491,0.97,4310.673,4311.34,"Okay, hearing none.",134,,
492,0.97,4311.34,4313.175,We will go ahead and go down the line.,134,,
493,0.97,4313.175,4318.28,"Next up is Council member Morales, then we will hear from Council member Mosqueda, good morning.",134,,
494,0.97,4318.28,4320.949,"Good morning, colleagues.",135,,
495,0.97,4320.949,4325.888,There are no items from the community economic development on today's agenda.,135,,
496,0.97,4325.888,4340.002,"We did meet last Friday, and approved 17 appointments for various commissions, so those will be coming before full counsel next Monday on the first.",135,,
497,0.97,4340.002,4358.287,"Last week, I attended the board of health meeting as Council member Mosqueda mentioned, and want to say, we know that our neighbors are really frustrated with the Rollout of the vaccines, so I want to acknowledge that there were some computer glitches.",135,,
498,0.97,4358.287,4376.905,"There is sort of a confusing array of tiers of eligibility, and we want to be clear that right now, we are focused on Vaccinations for Elders in the community, and for folks who are front-line Healthcare workers, home Healthcare workers, to make sure that they get access.",135,,
499,0.97,4376.905,4395.357,"So we also do know that we need to get information out that is for non-English speakers, and we need to be creating the infrastructure for more easily accessible sites, particularly in South Seattle and South King County.",135,,
500,0.97,4395.357,4414.977,"So certainly, there's several things we need to be doing, but I want to make sure that our community understands that the real challenge right now is, we just don't have enough supply of the vaccines . What we learned in that meeting is that, the counties receiving anywhere from 12,000 to 73,000 doses per week.",135,,
501,0.97,4414.977,4429.892,"It's really fluctuating, and that range makes it really hard for our public health workers to anticipate how many Vaccinations they will be able to do in any given week, in any given day.",135,,
502,0.97,4429.892,4463.025,"It also makes it really hard to schedule staff, to schedule appointments, so this is kind of what happens when we don't have an actual plan for how to Rollout a vaccine, but Thankfully now we will be Ramping up production, president Biden has indicated that he, while he has invoked the defense production act, so we may be getting more supply, more vaccines, all of that should become more Predicable over time.",135,,
503,0.97,4463.025,4467.83,"So I will add to that, I have scheduled a follow-up meeting with director Hayes in South Seattle.",135,,
504,0.97,4467.83,4474.102,"We know that we have lots of folks who still don't have the Internet and right now, that's how people are checking common to see if they are eligible.",135,,
505,0.97,4474.102,4477.306,We have a lot of folks who don't speak English as a first language.,135,,
506,0.97,4477.306,4502.13,"So while we wait to wrap up the pretty debility, sufficient quantities of the vaccine, I'm hoping to meet with her and understand better what we are doing to establish the infrastructure that we need, to get more information out, to get more easily accessible sites set up, so that, eventually those folks will have access in a language they understand in a way that they can get the information.",135,,
507,0.97,4502.13,4509.271,"So I'm happy to update, once I have a chance to have that conversation with director Hayes.",135,,
508,0.97,4509.271,4520.682,"Later this week, I will be speaking at the big bold Jewish climate Fest, in anticipation of sort of the Jewish birthday.",135,,
509,0.97,4520.682,4536.098,"I've been asked to join a panel, and I'm excited that I will be speaking with members from across the country, from Boston and La and New York City, we will be seeking together on a panel about the role that cities will play in addressing climate change.",135,,
510,0.97,4536.098,4540.402,So I'm looking forward to that.,135,,
511,0.97,4540.402,4552.514,"And finally, I want to acknowledge the very disturbing revelation that we had last week about Councilmember Sawant receiving death threats.",135,,
512,0.97,4552.514,4597.192,"As elected officials, we have all experienced eight male and lots of other things, but this year there has been a dangerous escalation, and expression that goes way beyond free speech, and I know the women on this counsel have the special experience of receiving crude and Misogynistic voice messages that very often include threats of sexual violence . I will say that over Recess, my husband received a letter in the mail of pornographic images with my face pasted over them . So we understand those of us who were called the public service will be targets in all matters of Divisiveness and hate.",135,,
513,0.97,4601.196,4612.674,"But when Councilmembers have their windows broken, their parents Costed, and when actual violence is threatened, that crosses a line.",135,,
514,0.97,4612.674,4618.48,And repeated threats are caused not just for harm but for action.,135,,
515,0.97,4618.48,4638.1,"So I'm glad to know that the fire Department and the police Department is investigating the threats, but what counts member Sawant received last week.",135,,
516,0.97,4638.1,4653.382,"They will be brief not just on those investigations, but the investigations of the five SPD officers who were present at the insurrection on January sixth @ . We cannot let this go unchecked and we won't let these attempts to silence us keep us, keep this counsel from doing the people's work.",135,,
517,0.97,4653.382,4678.14,"I want to close by quoting our future President, Amanda Gorman, who so eloquently spoke at President Biden's Inauguration, when she said, we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation, because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation.",135,,
518,0.97,4678.14,4683.645,"With that, Council President, I will Delete my report.",135,,
519,0.97,4683.645,4693.321,"Thank you, council member Morales, for those closing remarks, and for your report, really appreciate that.",136,,
520,0.97,4693.321,4701.963,"Colleagues, any comments or questions related to that report?",136,,
521,0.97,4701.963,4705.033,"Okay, hearing none.",136,,
522,0.97,4705.033,4707.869,We are going to go ahead and continue down the line here.,136,,
523,0.97,4707.869,4718.613,"Colleagues, as I mentioned at the top of this agenda section, we did invite Karina from our counsel central staff to join us in Council briefing this morning.",136,,
524,0.97,4718.613,4737.799,"So the Councilmembers who were, are not members of Councilmember Mosqueda's Finance and housing committee have the benefit of just getting a general overview from counsel central staff about the hazard pay legislation that we will be voting on this afternoon at full counsel.",136,,
525,0.97,4737.799,4758.42,"It did received unanimous support from all members of the Finance and housing Committee, and I'm sure Council member Mosqueda is going to have lots to add and say about the policy and the legislative intent behind the policy.",136,,
526,0.97,4758.42,4785.647,"I did want to give Karina just a quick opportunity to give us that briefing with Councilmember Mosqueda's permission, would be happy to have or do that now, or immediately before or sort of take a pause in your presentation on other matters, council member Mosqueda, to hear from Karina, how would you like to proceed?",136,,
527,0.97,4785.647,4788.717,"Karina, if you're interested in providing an overview, I think that would be fine.",137,,
528,0.97,4788.717,4795.857,"I have some more of the comments about the intent and the discussions we had, and what's going on in other jurisdictions, and some feedback about the why in certain circumstances.",137,,
529,0.97,4795.857,4804.9,"Council President, I will be happy to provide those after Karina provides an overview of the legislation, if that sounds good.",137,,
530,0.97,4804.9,4808.57,"Yeah, and it doesn't have to be as lengthy as it was in committee.",138,,
531,0.97,4808.57,4822.684,"Just a quick sort of overview of the, how the legislation functions, and I'm sure Councilmember Mosqueda will do a fine job of filling in the context and adding more texture there.",138,,
532,0.97,4822.684,4848.91,"So with that being said, Karina, go ahead and give us that quick presentation, then we will shift over to Councilmember Mosqueda, and then, Karina, if you could just hang tight, during Council briefing in the event that there are any questions that come up after people have the benefit of hearing your presentation, and Council member Mosqueda's presentation, then I think, I think we will be set . take it away, Karina, good morning.",138,,
533,0.97,4848.91,4850.912,"In mourning, Council members.",139,,
534,0.97,4850.912,4875.136,"In the description of the hazard pay for grocery employees legislation, at the heart of this law, is a requirement for grocery businesses to provide their employees with the hazard pay of $4 for each hour worked in Seattle during the Covid-19 emergency, and since it is emergency legislation, it would have an immediately effective date.",139,,
535,0.97,4875.136,4895.423,"Coverage would be on employees, who are covered by Seattle's minimum wage ordinance, and who worked in Seattle at a retail location in the grocery business, and grocery businesses are defined as those that have 500 or more employees worldwide, and that includes count of employes in any franchise network.",139,,
536,0.97,4895.423,4912.207,"And then a grocery business, it would be either a store with 10,000 square feet or more, primarily engaged in retail and groceries, or also a store with over 85,000 square feet with 30% or more of its sales floor area selling groceries.",139,,
537,0.97,4912.207,4919.881,So that would include a store that is selling general merchandise and groceries are one of its many items that it is selling.,139,,
538,0.97,4919.881,4927.789,The legislation supposedly does not cover convenience stores or food Marts or farmers markets.,139,,
539,0.97,4927.789,4939.601,"The hazard pay requirement, as I mentioned earlier, would be $4 for each hour worked in Seattle practice pay would be on top of the other compensation, such as wages or bonuses for things that are not Covid related.",139,,
540,0.97,4939.601,4956.618,"There is an explicit prohibition on reducing an employees compensation to provide the hazard pay, and employers would need to keep a record to establish the reason for any reduction in compensation that might happen, while this ordinance is in effect.",139,,
541,0.97,4956.618,4975.637,"There is recognition that some employers are paying their employees the equivalent of a hazard pay and might go by a different name, but it is above their regular wages, so the legislation does allow employers to count the amount of appreciation pay towards their hazard pay requirements.",139,,
542,0.97,4975.637,4989.984,"At the end, they would still need to pay the sum total of $4 an hour, it would need to comply with basic Recordkeeping requirements to show that they are fulfilling their obligation.",139,,
543,0.97,4989.984,5000.228,Hazard pay would not be included in an employees paid sick and save time pay.,139,,
544,0.97,5000.228,5003.665,"And as was common with other labor standards, employers would be displaying a notice of rights.",139,,
545,0.97,5003.665,5012.574,"They would have three years of Record-Keeping, and the office of labor standards would be enforcing this law, and employees would also have a private right of action.",139,,
546,0.97,5012.574,5017.078,"This law would be in effect, as currently written, through the end of the Covid-19 emergency.",139,,

637,0.97,5718.379,5742.77,"I just want to make sure that I understand, in terms of how the pay will be recorded for workers, that the Paystub will reflect the hours that they worked at their normal pay rate, and then a separate line item will be included to demonstrate the hazard pay that's been added to that, based on their race, is that right?",152,,
638,0.97,5742.77,5744.772,"Just so it's very clear for workers, what's going on?",152,,
639,0.97,5744.772,5745.773,"Yes, that is correct.",153,,
640,0.97,5745.773,5766.694,"Those requirements already exist under cities wage, and this makes absolutely clear that there is requirements do apply to this hazard pay legislation, so all paychecks must be itemized, and employees must receive what is called a revised notice of implement information, showing that their pay is going to increase.",153,,

642,0.97,5775.436,5778.906,Can ask one more question?,154,,
643,0.97,5778.906,5786.447,"So we talked a little bit about this last week, but the penalty is $50 per person per day.",154,,
644,0.97,5786.447,5806.133,"Can you talk a little bit about, I just want to make sure that the smaller grocers, who may have trouble with Record- keeping, or whatever, aren't sort of disproportionately affected by penalties, if there is a challenge here?",154,,
645,0.97,5806.133,5810.971,Can you talk a little bit about how Ols sort of monitors that?,154,,
646,0.97,5810.971,5821.582,"Yeah, so to clarify, the penalties for violating the law, first of all, to make sure that employees get the money that's owed to them.",155,,
647,0.97,5821.582,5828.556,"Than the director at the office of labor standards have the ability to award three times the amount is owed to them, depending on the severity of the situation.",155,,
648,0.97,5828.556,5840.768,"Employers can have civil penalties imposed on them that would go to the city, or the director to decide that those penalties go to the worker.",155,,
649,0.97,5840.768,5844.972,Those penalties can be up to $500 per worker.,155,,
650,0.97,5844.972,5885.446,"Now if, in the situation that office of labor standards is conducting an investigation, and the business is not providing them with adequate records, at all, or perhaps they are giving them several boxes of Unorganized records, which kind of is the equivalent of not getting sufficient records, then instead of waiting through all of those records and having intake six months to a year to year and a half to figure out exactly how much an employee is owed, Ols director can instead designate a $50 penalty for a worker for each day that there was deemed to have been a violation.",155,,
651,0.97,5885.446,5889.149,So it's not automatically a $50 penalty that goes to the worker.,155,,
652,0.97,5889.149,5892.453,"Typically would only be the amount that is due to them, perhaps times three.",155,,
653,0.97,5892.453,5901.228,"But if there are insufficient records, that can be a $50 director decides in the interest of efficiency.",155,,
654,0.97,5901.228,5902.263,Rather than the precise amount.,155,,
655,0.97,5902.263,5922.082,"Now, in any investigation, the director also has the ability to look at the totality of the circumstances that led to the employer violating the law, which could be that perhaps there wasn't knowledge of this legislation, perhaps there was legal counsel that didn't adequately advise them, perhaps there was a Bookkeeper that made a mistake.",155,,
656,0.97,5922.082,5924.551,Any of those situations can arise.,155,,
657,0.97,5924.551,5934.028,"Director takes those considerations that can take them into account, when determining the penalty that is imposed on the employer.",155,,
658,0.97,5934.028,5938.198,"However, the amount that is owed to the employee always stays the same.",155,,
659,0.97,5938.198,5949.109,"It's just the penalty that can be lowered, less than 500, depending on the circumstances that led to the violation.",155,,
660,0.97,5949.109,5951.178,"Okay, thank you.",156,,
661,0.97,5951.178,5952.579,Thanks for clarifying that.,156,,
