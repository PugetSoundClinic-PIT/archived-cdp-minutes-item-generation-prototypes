We treated heather with high respect . recent articles state lacks excellent Cannabis was present for the historical Finance social equity and Cannabis by Mayor Harrell . Thi was completely false . Black excellence in Cannabis was not present . We were simply an Afterthought . Jamal Crawford I a pioneer of Raynor Beach boys basketball . It would make sense for him to be part of the groundbreaking for new Raynor Beach high school along with Mayor Harrell . You would think Peter Manning, and medical Cannabis Pioneer, along with myself, would be respected and receive an invite to the siding this question was asked by a journalist . where are the black pioneers? But instead, there was the illusion, with hand-picked blacks who were Onl there to be servants . having a seat at the table for future city of Seattle social equity I Cannabis dialogue was fine, but the question is, what will be city do to undo the harm from the unjust closures by the city in 2015, 2016? seeing city of Seattle employees who were directly connected to the Unjus closures of Black-Owned Dispensaries present at a Socia equity Cannabis signing was a slap in the face, bringing the past trauma back to the forefront . City of Seattle seem to be completely out of the touch with the community and black pioneers . We will not stand for illusion of inclusion Councilmember Sawant, you have been very outspoken regarding social injustice to blacks . We have reached out to you several months ago and have not heard back.",28,,

42,0.97,453.052,539.438,"Really don't like to use titles but one thing I will use in my war chest is the fact that social equity was brought to th forefront I myself in 2014. I noticed there was an and discrepancy, or there was, ther was a lack of inclusion of Blac and Brown in the Cannabis industry in the state of Washington . I, I pitched this argument to the Lcd . I kept up the fight and got the notion, or was tried--I was given the notion that I was, I was under some type of delusion . clear as day, there is no black or brow representation in the Cannabis industry . to have a city Counci person, to have someone from the Mayor's office go before th media and say that we were at some advantage, which we weren', for some social equity signing, which was an insult to us as an organization, it's an insult to his black and Brown people . I cannot wait for the media to get a hold of this, to dig into it, to sink their Teet in it . Because recently, I just read an article where it talked about Marginalization . It was a Commissioner . It was a group of them, and the same thing that they spoke of that I spoke of here before . The problem is, when people talk about us and don't include us in the conversation, as if we're incompetent to stand or to recognize social inequality in our, in our communities.",31,,
43,0.97,539.438,567.967,"Councilmember Mosqueda, Breann Taylor . We recognize the, the, the inequality in our community we don't need you to put a Blac face or brown face on a white agenda . We need you to understand there's a real agenda about a lack of Inclusio in this Cannabis industry in Washington, and we're going to stand here and we're going to scream it from the highest point . Thank you.",31,,
44,0.97,567.967,574.74,Our next Speaker is Marguerite Bechard.,32,,

County that chose to step forward as a result of what LORI Martinez said . Now, back to this . I'm holding exhibit a because of the fact that our free speech I still being chopped up, okay? s we have Alex Tsimerman . I'm not defending him . I'm defending th Constitution in which judge Brown stated, you don't have t like me, and I don't have to like you, but I do have to enforce the Constitution of the United States . so as long as I' not threatening, and I'm not yelling ""fire"" in a building that's not on fire, then you can say whatever you need to say, and that's kind of like what the outskirts have done with me ever since I've been Testifying . So I come here, and I, you know, I don't know if I created a problem . I don't thin so . I think that it's Off-Balance, just like how they talk about the chickens coming home to roost because of what happened in L.A. County . It was down in the pits somewhere, an they had to come forward so we could see the reality of what goes on behind the scenes all the time, and then you put a sign on the first floor, black lives matter, and honorable Michael B. fuller and myself sitting there, and then a foreign guard comes up there an causes Posttraumatic stress because it happened in June, and he was dead in August . You say, Oh, I didn't do it! yes, you did . because I had never seen him so, so upset in my LIF come out of all the years that have been knowing him . Yeah, 21 so that's what I'm saying . I don't agree with you just Trespassing somebody because you didn't like what they said and they were threatening! The were obeying the Constitution when they were speaking!",33,,

48,0.97,714.246,838.204,"Good afternoon . Howard gale district 7 with Seattle Stop.Org . two years ago, two years after George Floyd, the budget, the Council is now considering proposes more money for the police and wastes over $11 million on police accountability system that still has police investigating police . This is $11 million spent denying victims of police violence, and he appeals or an semblance of justice for accountability . This budget provides monies for victims of violence unless that violence is perpetrated by a Seattle police officer . This budget provides monies to stem gun violence, unless that violence is perpetrated by a Seattle police officer . This bias is embedded throughout our public safety system . Seattle police D not even count police killings as Homicides in our Homicide data, though King County and every other state agency reporting these Stats, of course, does . Why defend and support those that Perpetrate the violence when they are police, and denied the victims and their families any form of support? our current accountability systems are not assisting victims with navigating a flawed system, more designed to protect police officers as opposed to holding them accountable . victim landscape complaints are low lost in bureaucracy and dismissed the vast majority of the time, without any process O right of appeal, despite city law mandating such a process over five years ago . I want to repeat that . In 2017, this council passed a law requiring a right of appeal when cases G to OPA . There has been no progress on that . Nothing has been done . We need a budget that serves people, especially those injured by how you spend our tax money . We need monies to support victims of police violence and their families, an we need a police accountability system that actually holds police accountable . please go t Seattle Stop.Org to find out Ho Seattle Stop.Org .

56,0.97,863.929,903.969,"Couple of items . First, let me check the agenda . item K, I think you know personally, but for those Councilmembers who don't know, I'm not a big fan O anyone with hate at a public meeting, and I find that disruptive, and it's been an ongoing issue with this individual, and I'm very disappointed as well that the documents related to his appeal and the exclusion are not Online .

It I my understanding, for many social media reports, including a coalition of open government award winner, whose name carries a lot of weight, that Councilmember Dan Strauss held a private meeting yesterday and kicked the media out, and I Jus find that beneath him .

This parcel will also be included in Roosevelt station overlay, and this reasoning will allow for the development of 91 units, 91 unit apartment buildings, including seven affordable housing units .

The details matter, you know? in my view, it's not sufficient to automatically assume that Uploading is Alway beneficial to the public, because each situation is different . In this case, after much consideration, I believe this project will be beneficial . I believe it's a NE positive for the community.",76,,
93,0.97,1283.782,1375.707,"While the project will Demolis an empty small business structure and a single-family home and several trees, including a large Conifer will be removed, in exchange, the project would build 91 residential units . not only 84 marker units, it also seven low income units on site . This is rare example of For-Profit REA estate building those low income housing units right away, on-site, performing, instead of writing a check for those to be built later . This increase in density is not just anywhere it's directly on our city's frequent transit bus network, just a three minute walk from a new light rail station and while this product is asking fo a Rezone that was not part of the original up zone of the Roosevelt neighborhood, that urban village up zone is more than 10 years old, so it's, it was worth Revisiting this on this site . In addition, the product whether a public Proces that collected and considered community input . So overall, with all the Trade-Offs, I believe this product makes a Lo of sense . Well it's not as beneficial as the 254 new low income housing units, just a block away at Cedar crossing, believe this result will be a net positive for the neighborhood, so consistent wit my vote in Committee, I'll be voting yesterday on this proposed project .
