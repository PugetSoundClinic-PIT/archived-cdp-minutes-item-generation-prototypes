122,0.97,876.108,893.559,We know all of this because of two--not one--two staff members who became Whistleblowers here at one of whom had an honorable military career who tries to do the right thing at great personal risk.,38,,

171,0.97,1316.481,1328.66,The Cadillac hotel serves as a Urm poster child . The good shepherd center is a critical Sructure in the city but vulnerable in a seismic event.,46,,
172,0.97,1328.66,1333.098,It is a costly endeavor.,46,,
173,0.97,1333.098,1337.669,Historic Seattle has been extensively involved in working with the city on Urm policies.,46,,
174,0.97,1337.669,1356.888,"I served on a Urm policy committee and our executive director Ty Kelly was on the earlier technical Committee, both managed by STC I. we support the goals outlined in the program particularly the goal to preserve Seattle's culturally significant landmarks to contribute to neighborhood character.",46,,

182,0.97,1412.344,1412.778,Thank you.,48,,
183,0.97,1412.778,1417.849,I think we need to have a 21St- century redevelopment and tear down a lot of unsafe buildings.,48,,
184,0.97,1417.849,1473.705,"I called here today because I think it is evident we need to investigate an FBI investigation on the human services Department . They have been causing unnecessary suffering adding to the homeless crisis since recorded violations in 2018 that have been repeatedly ignored by the Council's oversight who uses homeless money to redirect to other policies, protesters, and activists to ensure election support while incompetent Subhuman Mistreating director Parlaying politically connected favors took off to politically connect Nonprofits after overseeing $386 million with no legitimate increase in homeless shelter for the third winter of Covid amiss Malfeasance, no accounting for expenditures, while minimum investment that numbers of homeless shelters.",48,,

186,0.97,1482.214,1531.162,"The city council would rather passively aggressive refused to make a legitimate offer to solve the homeless crisis then next year after we pay someone else to do the job . I think we need an investigation of the entire homeless industrial complexes political connections to the Council's apparatus who doesn't care about the homeless, who is bringing a racist agenda to decide who is going to be held with high priority for all of the criminals down at the encampment at Pioneer square, who were brutally raping and ruining people's lives . They are in a hotel right now while people are still in the street for another winter while all of these millions of dollars have been squandered by politically connected operatives!",48,,
187,0.97,1531.162,1533.398,"Thank you, David.",49,,
188,0.97,1533.398,1536.001,That concludes our public comment.,49,,

194,0.97,1563.028,1573.838,"I just want to open it up first with a couple opening remarks, if that's okay.",51,,
195,0.97,1573.838,1575.373,We will do a round of introduction.,51,,
196,0.97,1575.373,1589.421,"I am really happy to have a focus from the human services Department, the city budget office, and FA ask who will share what work they have been undertaken to strengthen its financial management controls and practices.",51,,
197,0.97,1589.421,1603.068,Director noble alerted several of us in August via a memo to difficulties they have been experiencing in managing its finances connected with the Department's rapid growth over several years.,51,,
198,0.97,1603.068,1611.576,"As a Councilmember with oversight through this Committee, I asked for a briefing at that time.",51,,
199,0.97,1611.576,1618.483,"The human services Department has shared and they retain a consultant, Alvarez and Marcil.",51,,
200,0.97,1618.483,1644.876,"They had completed a preliminary assessment and they were in the process of identifying immediate tasks for the Department to take on . In addition, I think most people re aware of the incident with the Hsd contractor at Mary's place who experienced significant fraud earlier this year where payments from the human services Department were Misdirected to a fraudulent account.",51,,
201,0.97,1644.876,1677.409,"Director noble followed up with the memo in October providing an update and identifying the need for additional employees at the human services Department per the recommendation of Alvarez and Marcel . The Council added eight positions to Hsd for the purpose and appropriated $100,000 for those positions that director noble had set aside to partially pay for these positions.",51,,
202,0.97,1677.409,1680.512,We added the positions on an emergency basis with the support of director noble.,51,,
203,0.97,1680.512,1723.088,"I'm sorry, I should correct director noble added those and the Council's action made them permanent . They will need additional funds to fully fund the positions through the end of 2022 and they are looking at finding those funds in concert with Council central staff . In addition, late in the budget process the human services Department identified an additional need based on funds that the Council was adding to the budget and the Council created and funded three additional positions to support the additional service investments in the 2022 budget added by the Council.",51,,
204,0.97,1723.088,1731.496,These positions or contracts and grant specialists and a strategic advisor.,51,,

206,0.97,1736.901,1742.774,"If we could do a quick round of introductions, who you are with, which Department you are with, and we will get started on your presentation.",51,,
207,0.97,1742.774,1745.61,Thank you.,51,,
208,0.97,1745.61,1747.112,Hello.,52,,

213,0.97,1766.598,1768.233,Thank you.,56,,
214,0.97,1768.233,1787.852,"Next slide, please . We have the opportunity here--and thank you so much, council chair Herbold, to present the human services Department or Hsd financial operational improvement plan at committee today.",56,,
215,0.97,1787.852,1813.077,"Hsd is joined by our partners primarily because they are excellent partners with subject matter expertise and their support is invaluable, and also because this has been a multi- Department effort spanning several years . We will highlight critical points so you understand how we got here, what the issues are, and what the path forward is.",56,,
216,0.97,1813.077,1833.665,"We have for you--and I apologize, we actually removed the next steps and changed some of the order, so what we are going to just drive is our financial management background, the prior actions, our operational and financial improvement plan . We are going to highlight the improvement areas.",56,,
217,0.97,1833.665,1837.068,Joe will be speaking a lot.,56,,
218,0.97,1837.068,1843.374,We will give you a project status update because we have been all hands on deck working on this for some time now.,56,,
219,0.97,1843.374,1845.009,We will end with restaurants.,56,,
220,0.97,1845.009,1850.481,"Of course, time permitting.",56,,
221,0.97,1850.481,1855.186,"With that, I will hand it over to director noble to provide a little bit of background on the next slide, please.",56,,
222,0.97,1855.186,1878.543,"Thank you, director Kim . My goal is to give you contacts of how we get here . The most fundamental reason, the scale of the operation that the human services Department has grown tremendously in the last few years focused in part and particularly on the areas of homelessness, but certainly not exclusively.",57,,
223,0.97,1878.543,1892.357,"As the capacity has grown, we as a city did not do a good job of Ramping up their financial operations both in terms of their scales and the number of folks involved in that work but also in its structure.",57,,
224,0.97,1892.357,1902.734,As you will see moving towards a more centralized structure for lack of a better word disciplined structure.,57,,
225,0.97,1902.734,1910.675,That wasn't the only issue appear they are often compounding factors.,57,,
226,0.97,1910.675,1927.258,"Another one is in that same window between 2016 and 2021, particularly 2018 in 2019, and again, director Lee can talk more about this, but we track both the revenue center costs and alike.",57,,
227,0.97,1927.258,1952.016,This is a particularly powerful system that did require that all parts go through their existing structures and reestablish them . the way that was done at Hsd was more aligned than the one they have been growing into and we ended up with a system that was overly complex and not really serving their needs . an opportunity now to Revisit some of that as well.,57,,
228,0.97,1952.016,1959.924,We will talk more about the structure as well moving toward a more centralized view.,57,,
229,0.97,1959.924,1979.344,"Interestingly one of the ways this Manifests, and this bullet is talking about cash balance and anticipated . One might normally think that was a result of expenditure issues and overspending, but actually more likely in this case the opposite.",57,,
230,0.97,1979.344,1996.761,"One of the things that is not necessarily well appreciated, when we grant budget authority and the authority to spend money, that is backed up by revenue forecast . Some of those our forecast of tax revenues in the city continues.",57,,
231,0.97,1996.761,2008.072,Others are grant or payments that we bill third parties to and we pass to service providers.,57,,
232,0.97,2008.072,2019.283,One of the issues we have had is the ability to build the Federal Government for the monies they are counting on and having as well.,57,,
233,0.97,2019.283,2032.697,They move forward with expenditures to make sure they are provided with every reimbursement but we weren't getting it in a timely way because of some of the issues you are going to hear about.,57,,
234,0.97,2032.697,2039.804,That was obviously a big red flag for us on where things were.,57,,
235,0.97,2039.804,2053.818,One of the other realities about this is the Covid pandemic interrupted an effort and slowed us down some . We have been working hard on this in 2018 and 2019.,57,,
236,0.97,2053.818,2066.13,"As 2020 hit and we were moving forward, the city as a whole we focused a lot of our efforts to pandemic response.",57,,
237,0.97,2066.13,2072.703,"Entirely appropriate, but as we have reached a more stable level there, obviously that work is ongoing.",57,,
238,0.97,2072.703,2076.14,We have time to refocus and we need to.,57,,
239,0.97,2076.14,2082.046,You will hear more today on what that refocus looks like at Hsd.,57,,
240,0.97,2082.046,2088.152,"With that, I will turn it over to Glen for more history.",57,,
241,0.97,2088.152,2093.424,"Thank you very much, then.",58,,
242,0.97,2093.424,2132.396,"By the mid part of 2018 and the late part of 2018, Hsd staff as well as our financial auditors could tell that we were struggling with some of the processes and practices and so we dedicated staff to a specific assessment and helped with Transactional accounting in some of the monthly assessment and so forth needed to operate a program as big and complicated as Hsd.",58,,
243,0.97,2132.396,2152.049,"One of the outcomes of that assessment, it was clear to us that Hsd needed a lead financial person that was, you know, at the level of or had the background and stature of far more complicated departments.",58,,
244,0.97,2152.049,2155.987,Hsd is not necessarily the largest dollar Department.,58,,
245,0.97,2155.987,2161.225,It is sophisticated because of all of the different funding sources.,58,,
246,0.97,2161.225,2192.557,"A recommendation was to hire a chief financial officer . that occurred in February of 2020 and that was one of the results in addition, we wanted a firm to come in and help us assess at a very granular level Hsd processes for handling expenses and so forth.",58,,
247,0.97,2192.557,2207.772,We hired a firm in April of 2020 and they did complete a very detailed assessment of Hsd situations . This was the Francis and company report.,58,,
248,0.97,2207.772,2223.588,"They did not complete their assessment, unfortunately . that had to do with staff and Covid challenges and everything.",58,,
249,0.97,2223.588,2285.95,"So, with that information and report, Hsd did take actions to correct some of their processes or improve their processes with some preliminary analysis but by July and August of 2021, we realized we needed a firm to come in and help us design at a detailed level some of the improvement and implement them, so we hired another firm, Alverez and Marsal . that along with our staff here and commitments from Hsd staff is currently a process . a general plan was created in 2021 and now it is the detailed work time that is difficult and complicated, but I am confident there is commitment from our staff as well as Hsd to see improvements into 2022.",58,,
250,0.97,2285.95,2288.753,Thank you.,59,,
251,0.97,2288.753,2301.232,Can you just talk a little bit about 2019 and the actions that Hsd began implementing in 2019?,60,,
252,0.97,2301.232,2315.446,"There is a handful of frankly detailed accounting changes that were implemented, but they were not as robust as we were hoping for.",61,,
253,0.97,2315.446,2332.496,We also were banking on a new Cfo to come in and do the detailed assessment and engineering . The changes were some and improved a little bit.,61,,
254,0.97,2332.496,2348.112,"Our summary information and closing the books for 2019 relative to 2019, but it wasn't nearly enough and we were waiting on a new Cfo to provide leadership to resolve some of the more serious concerns that we have.",61,,
255,0.97,2348.112,2359.123,We are now in that position of having all of our resources on board thanks to the actions you have taken.,61,,
256,0.97,2359.123,2361.525,Thank you.,62,,
257,0.97,2361.525,2362.326,"Yeah, it really shows.",62,,
258,0.97,2362.326,2392.456,"Of course we understand the pace of work in 2020, slowing in response to Covid . But in 2019, you know, given that we first started seeing warning signs in 2018 with CBO's assessment, it shows the importance of having people in the positions --",62,,
259,0.97,2392.456,2396.06,Yes.,63,,
260,0.97,2396.06,2399.73,"And making that a priority to keep everything moving, so thank you for that.",64,,
261,0.97,2399.73,2401.732,"Next slide, please?",65,,
262,0.97,2401.732,2407.471,So here we are . We have an operational and financial improvement plan.,65,,
263,0.97,2407.471,2424.188,"I will refer to Alverez and Marsal as a & amp; M . In my tenure as acting director, I am excited to have a concrete plan that we are all working toward.",65,,
264,0.97,2424.188,2434.899,"To summarize, we are looking toward a more simplified financial structure with straightforward processes.",65,,
265,0.97,2434.899,2443.007,Clear segregation of work and it duties and appropriately sized and skilled Finance team.,65,,
266,0.97,2443.007,2453.918,"All of the policies and procedures that go with it, et cetera . Here is a list of things we are focusing on and my colleague will highlight some key areas.",65,,
267,0.97,2453.918,2466.13,"As director noble had mentioned, as well as director Lee, we are improving the timeliness and accuracy of our billing with Federal and state funds.",65,,
268,0.97,2466.13,2468.032,That is a starting to happen now.,65,,
269,0.97,2468.032,2487.918,We are working toward SIMPLIFYING Peoplesoft 9.2 financial structure beginning in the 2022 budget.,65,,
270,0.97,2487.918,2503.534,"We are streamlining our financial processes, implementing dashboard Metrics to provide accurate financial information, revise and improve--revise the approach for our CMS to Ccms transition in 2022.",65,,
271,0.97,2506.637,2509.473,This sounds a lot of jargon and we will explain in the further slides.,65,,
272,0.97,2509.473,2510.641,We have data that we use.,65,,
273,0.97,2510.641,2518.549,"And then increase staffing capacity, we have talked a lot about this to increase business needs and provide a more centralized management.",65,,
274,0.97,2518.549,2530.761,Of course with this Comms training staff on the new processes and really supporting people to be successful in this future state.,65,,
275,0.97,2530.761,2531.762,"Next slide, please?",65,,
276,0.97,2531.762,2543.307,"So, the next set of slides will be reviewed by my colleague, Joe, who is our Cfo that was hired.",65,,
277,0.97,2543.307,2551.282,Joseph Kasperski will highlight key areas so you can get a flavor of the actual work.,65,,
278,0.97,2551.282,2553.317,"It will get detailed, but Joe, please take it away.",65,,
279,0.97,2553.317,2561.292,"Thank you and good morning, everyone.",66,,
280,0.97,2561.292,2569.867,"I will walk you through the major focus areas of this initiative, starting with accounts receivable, which was previously discussed.",66,,
281,0.97,2569.867,2578.976,This is the process of how we collect cash from our Federal and state funding sources maintained in the human services Department.,66,,
282,0.97,2578.976,2593.123,"These funds account for approximately 38% of expenses, however our processes for generating the reimbursement are fragmented across the Department, which ended up resulted in a very high error rate and of course, high rejection rate by the state.",66,,
283,0.97,2593.123,2600.064,We were not able to replenish our cash payments but we are being made from agencies which results in a negative cash position.,66,,
284,0.97,2600.064,2616.48,This process is one of our current top focus areas and will result in consolidating billing Federal sources from accounting or within accounting using information directly from our Finance system.,66,,
285,0.97,2616.48,2629.693,This will greatly improve our accuracy and timeliness for receiving cash from our State and Federal sources.,66,,
286,0.97,2629.693,2630.294,"Next slide, please?",66,,
287,0.97,2630.294,2665.796,"Before we move on from that slide, I want to underscore what I thought I understood, but there is language on this slide that just gives me pause that I want to confirm . I was under the impression of the difficulties experienced in accounts receivable resulted in payments to the city being delayed, but not any significant lost revenue or reimbursement as it relates specifically to the accounts receivable difficulties . is that correct?",67,,
288,0.97,2665.796,2676.607,Yes . It did not result in a loss of revenue . What resulted in is the significant delay.,68,,
289,0.97,2676.607,2682.646,"For example, when billing the States, we bill monthly for title 19 for the state.",68,,
290,0.97,2682.646,2687.551,Each bill has to be done Incrementally and improved by the state.,68,,
291,0.97,2687.551,2703.367,What we were previously doing was submitting four or five months worth of billing and they would find an error with the first month and that would reject all subsequent Billings that were dependent on one another.,68,,
292,0.97,2703.367,2727.591,"That is one of the processes we have stopped . We will submit one bill at one time, but we are still in the process of the backlog of billing, but generally we are probably within one month of being current with all of our back bills.",68,,
293,0.97,2727.591,2728.792,We are getting back on track.,68,,
294,0.97,2728.792,2729.86,Thank you.,69,,
295,0.97,2729.86,2731.695,Rejection does not mean a lack of reimbursement.,69,,
296,0.97,2731.695,2735.599,It means a delay of reimbursement.,69,,
297,0.97,2735.599,2741.405,"That specific word, Yeah.",70,,
298,0.97,2741.405,2743.841,"You have the opportunity to take the test again, if you will.",70,,
299,0.97,2743.841,2753.984,Sorry for that confusion.,71,,
300,0.97,2753.984,2755.085,"Next, the accounts payable section.",71,,
301,0.97,2755.085,2766.23,"The next area is of course the accounts payable, a process of paying our agencies in another critical area to ensure payment was received and processed in a timely manner.",71,,
302,0.97,2766.23,2773.303,Our accounts payable assessment identified an inability to track invoices received by agencies to ensure timely payments were being made.,71,,
303,0.97,2773.303,2777.941,Another particularly challenging area is receiving monthly invoices from agencies.,71,,
304,0.97,2777.941,2789.52,"Historically, and what we are witnessing this year is up to 70% of annual invoices being submitted in the November, December, January Timeframe.",71,,
305,0.97,2789.52,2803.767,"Thus we have two issues, weight invoices being received by agencies which our division leaders are working with agencies to resolve, and there is not a central entry point for the Department to receive invoices.",71,,
306,0.97,2803.767,2815.946,"So, I have from a department perspective, I do not have an ability to track when the invoices came into the Department to ensure the payments are routed and processed in a timely manner.",71,,
307,0.97,2815.946,2837.201,"This also makes focusing financial status difficult as well as managing our cash balances challenging and creates delays in closing the financial system at the end of the year, which is where we are at today.",71,,
308,0.97,2837.201,2841.705,Next slide.,71,,
309,0.97,2841.705,2842.84,Procurement of goods and services.,71,,
310,0.97,2842.84,2850.881,Procurement is another area we will be centralizing purchasing similar to other departments in the city.,71,,
311,0.97,2850.881,2858.255,This will ensure consistent approaches adopted as well as providing safeguards.,71,,
312,0.97,2858.255,2865.095,This will result in a new branch being created as well as shifting responsibilities currently being performed in the county to this new branch.,71,,
313,0.97,2865.095,2878.508,This will ensure we have a separation of duties between those entering obligations . I address the decentralized and purchasing approach.,71,,
314,0.97,2878.508,2889.453,Hsd will be able to create consistent procurement process and provide a clear separation of duties before the recording contract and payments.,71,,
315,0.97,2889.453,2894.358,"Next slide, please?",71,,
316,0.97,2894.358,2904.067,Accounting and payroll.,71,,
317,0.97,2904.067,2913.644,This area is the backbone and will address the financial system structure which is currently overly complex and dependent on manual injustice.,71,,
318,0.97,2913.644,2926.189,We are SIMPLIFYING the financial world set and eliminating 4000 individual activities used to track cost and ensuring we have fully utilized the capability of our financial system versus relying on manual adjustments.,71,,
319,0.97,2926.189,2944.207,"This will result in three significant gains, financial transactions that will be recorded accurately and timely, and subsequent reports will be generated showing current financial information . There will be a significant reduction in errors and greater financial transfers . next slide, please?",71,,
320,0.97,2944.207,2955.285,"Just real quickly, the reference to the findings and concerns audit, which audit are you referring to?",72,,
321,0.97,2955.285,2957.187,There are a number of financial reports.,72,,
322,0.97,2957.187,2964.728,I just want to know which one that reference is concerning.,72,,
323,0.97,2964.728,2976.34,"Well, we have several audit observations over the past several years that I have noted regarding accounting and payroll.",73,,
324,0.97,2976.34,2982.312,The housing and urban development has noted we have been delinquent in payments.,73,,
325,0.97,2982.312,3003.667,"The state auditors have also noted that we have been, I guess, rather cumbersome and we have a rather cumbersome process and they are encouraging a more streamlined approach.",73,,
326,0.97,3003.667,3004.434,There are actually several.,73,,
327,0.97,3004.434,3009.873,I can't point to a single audit . There have been several observations over the past.,73,,
328,0.97,3009.873,3024.755,"Part of this initiative, we review the past audit findings and insured corrective actions were appropriate . In some cases they weren't.",73,,
329,0.97,3024.755,3034.464,"In other cases, I think this initiative will actually correct the underlying causes that are essentially financial reporting for our financial structures.",73,,
330,0.97,3034.464,3037.367,Thanks.,74,,
331,0.97,3037.367,3049.479,"Sea for our budget and financial planning, this effort will focus on consolidating our budget sponsor abilities and planning in budget under the direction of the budget.",74,,
332,0.97,3049.479,3092.022,"Here again this area was decentralized across the Department . This will improve our strategic planning and ensure the funding that is entrusted in the Department will fully utilize in the community and areas that we support . remember, we have to ensure that funding entrusted to Hsd is spent in the communities and the areas where it was dedicated . for our organizational structure, I want to thank you for authorizing the creation of the new positions.",74,,
333,0.97,3092.022,3100.33,This was a critical item on the structure to increase capacity.,74,,
334,0.97,3100.33,3103.967,We increased the staff by eight new positions in the 2022.,74,,
335,0.97,3103.967,3107.237,Positions in finance will increase from 26 to 34.,74,,
336,0.97,3107.237,3114.711,Positions will be focused on accounting and will largely be senior principal accountants.,74,,
337,0.97,3114.711,3125.121,Three will be from the new procurement branch and--sorry.,74,,
338,0.97,3125.121,3125.522,I apologize.,74,,
339,0.97,3125.522,3152.549,We are hiring one additional position in budget . currently right now the position in budget has been filled and we are in the final phase of hiring and Onboarding the four accounting positions . These positions along with the improvements being made in our financial structures and processes will provide the Much- needed capacity to ensure Judiciary responsibilities to cities are being met.,74,,
340,0.97,3152.549,3162.893,"Just a finer point here, I understand you are in the process of hiring these positions.",75,,
341,0.97,3162.893,3179.943,"I know that we have labor shortage issues in the city, across private sector and public sector, and all different types of jobs . I am just wondering what you are finding here in your efforts to fill these positions.",75,,
342,0.97,3179.943,3187.851,Fortunately the candidates we have been putting in are very experienced and seasoned.,76,,
343,0.97,3187.851,3201.464,"We are not having time, you know, a challenge filling any accounting roles and I attribute that to the pay and benefits that the city offers.",76,,
344,0.97,3201.464,3204.267,"On the budget candidate pool, it is not as deep.",76,,
345,0.97,3204.267,3207.938,We did find a strong candidate with prior city experience.,76,,
346,0.97,3207.938,3216.78,Right now I am seeing no challenges for recruiting qualified candidates.,76,,
347,0.97,3216.78,3219.349,Good to hear.,77,,
348,0.97,3219.349,3227.657,I would like to concur on that . I have several vacancies as well but the quality of folks applying is really high.,78,,
349,0.97,3227.657,3239.402,"The overall labor market is tough . public sector accounting and financial affairs, we are doing Okay, so I am very pleased with that.",78,,
350,0.97,3239.402,3240.87,Okay.,79,,
351,0.97,3240.87,3244.708,The private status current project.,79,,
352,0.97,3244.708,3261.691,Each week a progress assessment occurs with our consultant team and along with the Department in each of the areas we previously discussed.,79,,
353,0.97,3261.691,3269.299,Milestones are shown on the slide.,79,,
354,0.97,3269.299,3270.734,The number of underlying tasks not completed.,79,,
355,0.97,3270.734,3275.705,We have an excess of 250 tasks being tracked for this initiative.,79,,
356,0.97,3275.705,3280.31,Overall work is progressing fairly well through most areas.,79,,
357,0.97,3280.31,3290.92,"Right now our top three priorities are closing the fiscal year, hiring, and ensuring the fiscal year 2022 financial structure is complete.",79,,
358,0.97,3290.92,3320.684,"For the specific areas, the accounts receivable area we are focusing on hiring positions, which is lagging slightly because of the holidays and since we are hiring accountants, they are closing their fiscal years at their previous and current . We will have to make a two week jump in January to start reporting . This is placing the effort a little behind schedule.",79,,
359,0.97,3320.684,3329.759,Also the investigation and review of records is taking a little more time than anticipated.,79,,
360,0.97,3329.759,3337.767,One of the important initiatives of focus areas is ensuring that our existing records are valid and accurate.,79,,
361,0.97,3337.767,3351.181,We found a handful of records that we are investigating that most likely will need to be resolved or written off.,79,,
362,0.97,3351.181,3357.42,That took a little bit of time because these are records that date back to the 2020 Timeframe.,79,,
363,0.97,3357.42,3367.63,Accounts payable is largely on task . largely on track.,79,,
364,0.97,3367.63,3376.139,We are taking a very detailed approach to make sure our life processes work and are shared throughout the divisions.,79,,
365,0.97,3376.139,3387.951,A Standup from the procurement branch will not occur until late January which impacts the segregation of duties milestones.,79,,
366,0.97,3387.951,3394.958,"Moving on to payroll and General accounting, this is the backbone and structure that we discussed.",80,,
367,0.97,3394.958,3399.729,The year end close process is not on track and is the focus here.,80,,
368,0.97,3399.729,3415.211,One of the challenges we are facing is the number of invoices we are currently receiving must be recorded and recorded to close the fiscal year appropriately.,80,,
369,0.97,3415.211,3423.887,Procurement is not on the critical path here it is not on the to do list immediately but is at risk depending on the recruiting and hiring process.,80,,
370,0.97,3423.887,3427.957,I am not anticipating any problems with the candidates.,80,,
371,0.97,3427.957,3434.063,We delay the account or hiring.,80,,
372,0.97,3434.063,3446.443,Budget and planning is important but once again is not on the path and focused on in January or we start making preparations for the 2023 budget submission.,80,,
373,0.97,3446.443,3451.915,"At risk means at risk of delay, correct?",81,,
374,0.97,3451.915,3454.217,Not at risk of not being done at all?,81,,
375,0.97,3454.217,3459.656,"Yes, absolutely.",82,,
376,0.97,3459.656,3464.627,It is basically an algebra account of the underlying tasks being completed.,82,,
377,0.97,3464.627,3480.31,"Tasks aren't weighted in this schedule as Criticality . It is pretty much just algebra if we are missing, you know, 21 tasks, it will be considered red.",82,,
378,0.97,3480.31,3504.334,"And on the at risk category also, just--when something is at risk, it is not delayed, it is just at risk of being delayed.",83,,
379,0.97,3504.334,3504.734,Correct.,84,,
380,0.97,3504.734,3510.24,At what point do you determine we are moving us out of the at risk category and into the delayed category?,85,,
381,0.97,3510.24,3516.079,Once the time you have scheduled for that task has come and gone?,85,,
382,0.97,3516.079,3521.985,"Yes, that is generally how it's done.",86,,
383,0.97,3521.985,3527.29,"The original private schedule date we are holding firm to, which was very aggressive.",86,,
384,0.97,3527.29,3553.983,"As the underlying tasks do that, they will be shown as delayed and given the number of tasks that are evaluated at risk, that is what trips it to read . We also put a little bit more, you know, Procurements at risk, but it is not what I would consider red and would not be considered red until sometime in January.",86,,
385,0.97,3553.983,3565.628,"Since we did in higher according to our original plan, this was one of the areas pushed into the January Timeframe.",86,,
386,0.97,3565.628,3574.604,So it is more about scheduling and we are holding ourselves accountable for us to keep moving things forward?,87,,
387,0.97,3574.604,3602.432,"There are a lot of Dependencies . As Joe was saying, we are strategically Prioritizing some areas over others . Even if there are some things that are at risk of being delayed, that may be a strategic choice because we really need to focus on other areas that must be addressed to make sure, you know, we have our grant funding back in and so forth.",87,,
388,0.97,3602.432,3605.268,This is about scheduling and making strategic decisions as we move forward.,87,,
389,0.97,3605.268,3608.338,I wanted to be transparent about where we are at.,87,,
390,0.97,3608.338,3620.283,"I'm sorry . You might have said this and I just missed it, but for the item that is delayed, I am assuming the target was year end for that item?",88,,
391,0.97,3620.283,3626.99,Based on the description of it.,88,,
392,0.97,3626.99,3636.566,Implement General accounting controls and at year end's close . I am assuming the target was year end?,88,,
393,0.97,3636.566,3639.002,That is correct and that was our top priority area.,89,,
394,0.97,3639.002,3647.51,"I am assuming that once something is delayed, you create a new target date?",90,,
395,0.97,3647.51,3648.111,To complete it?,90,,
396,0.97,3648.111,3650.78,"No, we hold the original target date.",91,,
397,0.97,3650.78,3651.648,Okay.,92,,
398,0.97,3651.648,3660.023,"Oh, what you are saying--I'm sorry.",93,,
399,0.97,3660.023,3660.723,I misunderstood the question.,93,,
400,0.97,3660.723,3666.996,"If something is already missed its target date and it is delayed, do you set a new target date?",94,,
401,0.97,3666.996,3690.42,"If I could Interject, when and if we Miss a date, we evaluate that Workflow relative to the status of everything else.",95,,
402,0.97,3690.42,3696.259,"I am most concerned about year end because in the end, I can't sell city bonds until it's complete and accurate and we have passed our audit.",95,,
403,0.97,3696.259,3707.87,"If we find we are having trouble, we have to reorganize and add more resources probably from my staff but certainly we organize our priorities to make sure the top things get done.",95,,
404,0.97,3707.87,3727.757,"I think what we want to portray is frequently certainly know, you know, less than every couple of weeks, we evaluate and how are we hitting the targets and how do we need to adjust in terms of allocating resources or efforts.",95,,
405,0.97,3727.757,3739.569,I think Joe's initial point about the top three items we are worried about are our priorities.,95,,
406,0.97,3739.569,3753.683,"As we run into complexities on a particular issue, we will figure out how difficult it is to resolve that and how much of a delay is a problem, especially in the top priority areas, and Reallocate resources as we need to to get back on track on the top priority items.",95,,
407,0.97,3753.683,3760.223,This is complicated and fluid.,95,,
408,0.97,3760.223,3773.736,We are actively engaged as a three agency group to rearrange our priorities and staff commitments depending on where we are with each of these projects.,95,,
409,0.97,3773.736,3775.438,Each individual item here.,95,,
410,0.97,3775.438,3790.953,"So, again, the item I am asking about is the item that is marked red, marked delayed.",96,,
411,0.97,3790.953,3799.262,Implement General accounting controls and executing year end has come and gone.,96,,
412,0.97,3799.262,3805.568,What is the new target date for that particular item?,96,,
413,0.97,3805.568,3820.583,"In this concept of, you know, holding ourselves accountable, if something is already been identified as delayed, I am assuming you are creating a new Timeline for that item.",96,,
414,0.97,3820.583,3824.287,Well in this case we have a fixed end date that the books have to be closed.,97,,
415,0.97,3824.287,3832.995,"In this particular milestone, there is a listing--I don't have the exact number, but the achievements we wanted to start.",97,,
416,0.97,3832.995,3848.01,One important area that we wanted to achieve where the monthly closes.,97,,
417,0.97,3848.01,3852.315,We should be closing our books monthly.,97,,
418,0.97,3852.315,3855.718,"We wanted that done in October, November, and December.",97,,
419,0.97,3855.718,3861.624,That way it makes your end very simple because you are only dealing with one month of Transactional information.,97,,
420,0.97,3861.624,3878.507,However we have not successfully delayed or implemented those monthly closes for such as invoice being received in a timely manner and a few other factors . that is what is prompting this as a read or delayed area.,97,,
421,0.97,3878.507,3887.25,The end date of getting everything closed by Mid- January is really not optional.,97,,
422,0.97,3887.25,3889.852,In this particular area.,97,,
423,0.97,3889.852,3894.557,"Okay, thank you.",98,,
424,0.97,3894.557,3895.358,That helps a lot.,98,,
425,0.97,3895.358,3895.758,Thank you.,98,,
426,0.97,3895.758,3905.301,"Thanks, Joe . It is complicated and again, I need to thank chair Herbold for allowing us to come to speak to this.",99,,
427,0.97,3905.301,3907.069,We are all hands on deck.,99,,
428,0.97,3907.069,3907.603,Even myself.,99,,
429,0.97,3907.603,3916.512,"This is important to Hsd, of course.",99,,
430,0.97,3916.512,3922.018,"If there is time, I am happy to take additional questions.",99,,
431,0.97,3929.825,3932.361,Looking for raised hands from my colleagues here.,100,,
432,0.97,3932.361,3935.398,Councilmember Pedersen?,100,,
433,0.97,3935.398,3937.133,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",101,,
434,0.97,3937.133,3964.827,"Thanks to everybody from the Department at Hsd, CBO, FAS . I really appreciate Glen mentioning the importance of those year end--that your end information.",101,,
435,0.97,3964.827,3967.196,That is going to be a priority.,101,,
436,0.97,3967.196,4017.88,"Within that list of projects, maybe that falls outside the list of projects, but with an increase in various kinds of Cyber attacks and Phishing scams where people Impersonate vendors, it is not so much the technology to block the Phishing scam . It is what the personnel are doing when they are seeing these Emails and what sort of protocols they have in place to double check when bank accounts are being changed or banks are being changed, the protocol of picking up the phone and calling somebody who is already on a Preapproved list of vendors or banks.",101,,
437,0.97,4017.88,4025.788,Tell us a little bit about that training happening on an individual basis and how frequently and how we make sure that each person knows those protocols.,101,,
438,0.97,4025.788,4029.458,Thank you for that.,102,,
439,0.97,4029.458,4061.157,"I just want to also highlight that it is not the corrective action that is only centered on training Hsd staff . It is the establishment of new protocols in light of the very, very unfortunate financial loss to Hsd that I understand is largely being made whole, but Nevertheless, those are taxpayer dollars.",102,,
440,0.97,4061.157,4061.524,Thank you.,102,,
441,0.97,4061.524,4069.832,That's right . I think Joe can speak to Hsd and Len can speak to additional safeguards.,103,,
442,0.97,4069.832,4070.099,Thanks.,103,,
443,0.97,4070.099,4075.137,"Yes, that was a most unfortunate thing.",104,,
444,0.97,4075.137,4097.059,"We were a victim of a Federal crime and since that time frame, not only did we subsequent to the initial or discover other attempts that were basically not acted upon.",104,,
445,0.97,4097.059,4126.989,"Once Mary's place came to our attention, we worked with Glen's team and we have adopted a citywide approach on how we process or accept payments, which provides a much greater control and oversight and becomes independent of the Department and with that, I can let Glen speak a little more to the controls in place by his staff for the city.",104,,
446,0.97,4126.989,4163.025,"To your point, Councilmember Herbold, we did adjust before Trainings and education processes for frontline Department staff that when they received Emails for this kind of change from a vendor or a provider to follow a particular procedure, we have decided because of the risk and the amount of these kinds that have occurred, it was far better for us to Internalize the analysis to my Treasury staff.",105,,
447,0.97,4163.025,4183.245,"Moving forward, any vendor or provider to the city that sends any kind of communication of the city saying please change our bank comes to a highly trained staff of about three of us here to evaluate at arms length.",105,,
448,0.97,4183.245,4196.825,"We have two people look at the request, validate it, and at least this version of this particular problem we think we can handle.",105,,
449,0.97,4196.825,4205.768,Cyber fraud is ever growing and ever changing and I want to emphasize no system of the city was ever touched by what happened with Mary's place.,105,,
450,0.97,4205.768,4212.675,"This was a breach of their system, not ours.",105,,
451,0.97,4212.675,4224.653,We have put very strict measures in place to try to pick up this kind of potential fraud in the future and for vendors.,105,,
452,0.97,4224.653,4228.29,Thank you.,106,,
453,0.97,4228.29,4233.796,Any other questions?,106,,

458,0.97,4286.215,4294.123,It often occurs to me that you and I share somewhat of a similar tenure in the city.,107,,
459,0.97,4294.123,4301.83,"You are among the most experienced colleagues, if I can use that term.",107,,
460,0.97,4301.83,4311.373,"I want you to know that my goal is to continue in service to the city, so I am hoping to be back in some other role.",107,,

462,0.97,4319.348,4347.71,"Even just if I could, I wanted to express my appreciation for the Council's support in a position of authority . It is not the most exciting policy work, but it is a back behind the scenes kind of work that needs to be done to implement human services that I know are a priority to all of us . again, it is the dirty laundry of the city, if you will.",107,,
463,0.97,4347.71,4354.216,Credit to Hsd and to Glen for stepping up to this.,107,,

468,0.97,4366.628,4387.049,Noble for serving in an incredibly difficult period in our city's history and going through an unprecedented series of budget related to the ups and downs of the Covid crisis and accessibility to my office and me personally throughout that period in navigating that.,109,,
469,0.97,4387.049,4407.002,"I just want to say, Dr. noble, if you are continuing to look for things in city service, I will send unsolicited vacancies on Council central staff as they arise for your consideration.",109,,

479,0.97,4453.182,4471.033,I had an opportunity to work with you in 2014 during a different mayoral administration and I have appreciated your honesty and integrity and how you execute your functions in a highly polarized environment.,112,,

488,0.97,4538.066,4541.703,Will the clerk please red item number two?,114,,
489,0.97,4541.703,4561.223,Council bill 120247 an ordinance relating to the organization of city government; adding data reporting responsibilities to the city attorney's office; and adding a new chapter 3.46 to the Seattle municipal code.,115,,
490,0.97,4561.223,4565.894,Thank you so much.,116,,
491,0.97,4565.894,4585.914,"We will get to introductions in just a second . Since this bill is sponsored by Councilmember Lewis and Council President Gonzalez, I would like to invite you to make introductory comments about the legislation before we turn it over to Council central staff.",116,,
492,0.97,4585.914,4600.662,"Thank you so much, Madam chair . do you need the procedure or do you want me to give an overview?",117,,
493,0.97,4600.662,4601.897,We will give a presentation.,118,,
494,0.97,4601.897,4602.264,Excellent.,119,,
495,0.97,4602.264,4602.664,Thank you.,119,,
496,0.97,4602.664,4608.17,I will make a couple of introductory remarks and turn it over to Asha for the details on her presentation.,119,,
497,0.97,4608.17,4617.679,"Everyone at the city council realized, and we hear this daily from our constituents, the city is facing a crisis of public safety.",119,,
498,0.97,4617.679,4671.333,That is one of the core responsibilities and charter obligations of the city to respond to and the Seattle city attorney's office plays a key role that has been extensively scrutinized over the course of the last several years and rightfully so in terms of the role that office plays is a critical part of our public safety infrastructure . This Council has been incredibly supportive to the work and the city attorney's office to make sure they have the tools to protect the people of the city of Seattle from ongoing criminal activity through a variety of different methods including the conventional prosecution and litigation in the Seattle city court as well as programs and alternatives to the traditional criminal legal system.,119,,
499,0.97,4671.333,4695.924,This year in the budget that we just debated over the course of the fall Council put forward the largest increase or the largest budget the city attorney's office has ever seen to give our full faith and confidence to the incoming city attorney in the transition to make sure they have the tools adequate to respond to the crisis at hand.,119,,
500,0.97,4695.924,4706.868,That budget has increased to $38 million from the previous cycle.,119,,
501,0.97,4706.868,4726.588,With that investment comes in obligation from the Council to exercise transparency and oversight of how that unprecedented increase that is warranted in spending in the city attorney's office is affected and delivering on a variety of Metrics.,119,,
502,0.97,4726.588,4735.73,This bill is something I have been working on with Council central staff off and on since August when it became clear there would be a transition.,119,,
503,0.97,4735.73,4737.966,It is not aimed in any way toward any individual.,119,,
504,0.97,4737.966,4749.077,We are experiencing leadership transition at a time of extreme public safety challenge as well as increased investment in the office.,119,,
505,0.97,4749.077,4769.865,This bill gets at the core commitment we have as city institutions to make sure there is effective transparency and with that great resource comes that transparency and how those programs are being implemented for both the benefit of our oversight as well as the public.,119,,
506,0.97,4769.865,4776.938,It mirrors similar data sharing practices that King County has exercised for a long time.,119,,
507,0.97,4776.938,4782.477,The processing attorney has a dashboard similar data to the public.,119,,
508,0.97,4782.477,4799.06,This is a great area of potential collaboration going forward between the Council and the incoming city attorney to make sure we are effectively deploying our resources to the greatest effect to respond to the safety crisis.,119,,
509,0.97,4799.06,4805.167,"With that, chair, I don't have additional comments.",119,,
510,0.97,4805.167,4813.275,I would like to concede to Council President Gonzalez and I'm looking forward to hearing the presentation from Asha.,119,,
511,0.97,4813.275,4835.297,"Thank you . It is a great opportunity to be able to advance this Council bill . as a reminder during the process, Councilmember Lewis mentioned we did increase the amount of dollars available--overall dollars available to the city attorney's office.",120,,
512,0.97,4835.297,4848.009,"We included language that articulated during the budget process . again, I believe this was early November or October.",120,,
513,0.97,4848.009,4894.155,Our intend to engage in the legislative process would include the Stakeholders of the city attorney's office to evaluate additional duties of the city attorney's office that would allow an opportunity for there to be increased transparency in terms of public reporting on data related to an important program to the city of Seattle as a whole and a program that is funded through the 2022 budget . I really do think it is important for the Council to pass policy that will allow for that reporting to take place as early on is possible in January.,120,,
514,0.97,4894.155,4928.49,"As a reminder, many dollars related to these programs are progressive and are waiting for this ordinance to pass that would create that path of data reporting that would allow for that increased transparency and ensure that our dollars are being used on diversion programs in a manner that is most effective to the public safety issues facing our city.",120,,
515,0.97,4928.49,4932.56,I am excited to hear from Asha on the presentation and I am looking forward to this morning's conversation.,120,,
516,0.97,4932.56,4952.213,"Before we handed over to Asha as part of introductions, I just want to confirm Alex, were you able to send the city attorney a lack elect the link?",121,,
517,0.97,4952.213,4961.589,Can you just make sure she's not in the waiting room?,122,,
518,0.97,4961.589,4962.39,She is not.,123,,
519,0.97,4962.39,4963.224,I appreciate that.,124,,
520,0.97,4963.224,4965.226,"Okay, I will hand it over to you, Asha.",124,,
521,0.97,4965.226,4966.461,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",125,,
522,0.97,4966.461,4977.539,I am Asha Venkataraman from Council central staff . please just give me one moment.,125,,
523,0.97,4977.539,4992.854,"Okay . so as Councilmembers mentioned, we are disgusting Council bill 120247, which describes the duties of the city attorney's office.",125,,
524,0.97,4992.854,5022.884,"Currently there aren't any sections in the Seattle municipal code about the attorney's office except for the Charter provisions in article 13 a section 3 of the Charter, which talks about the responsibility of the city attorney to have full supervisory control over litigation in the city and any other duties as prescribed by ordinance.",125,,
525,0.97,5022.884,5034.496,This ordinance has a new section to the code and adds in data reporting responsibilities governing the criminal division and Pre-Booking diversion programs.,125,,
526,0.97,5034.496,5070.198,"The legislation adds in the requirement for the city attorney's office to provide quarterly report primarily in the criminal division, so looking at the percentage of number of cases that end up being charged versus those that end up being diverted, looking at which cases are going to trial and for which offenses and which of those cases result in conviction, looking at dispositions on all charge cases and getting the Council information about race, Ethnicity, and gender for those individuals involved in the police report.",125,,
527,0.97,5070.198,5094.222,"One saying because the city attorney's office is going through a technological change to their case management system which will hopefully be completed by the end of next year, the Council should be able to receive more detailed reports once that technological change takes place.",125,,
528,0.97,5094.222,5097.659,It also includes reporting requirements.,125,,
529,0.97,5097.659,5123.284,"Right now the city attorney's office does give the Council annual reports about its mainstream diversion programs up until this point, that program has served individuals between 18 and 24 and all of the information you see listed in the ordinance and on the slide is information that the city attorney's office currently provides in their annual report.",125,,
530,0.97,5123.284,5136.698,The legislation adds this in as a requirement rather than an elected report that the city attorney's office decides to provide.,125,,
531,0.97,5136.698,5152.48,"Sorry, the Pre-Booking diversion program which currently is in the form of the lead program . The city attorney's office provides staff support to the program.",125,,
532,0.97,5152.48,5161.823,"They help with weed, Co-Lead.",125,,
533,0.97,5161.823,5183.811,"This reporting requirement does not go toward the clients involved in the program but looks to give the Council how the Attorney supporting that program are able to do their work, so looking at providing the Council with information and transparency about how this will work for that staff.",125,,
534,0.97,5183.811,5189.851,"So, those are the items in the ordinance itself.",125,,
535,0.97,5189.851,5193.454,The amendments currently listed on the agenda would do two things.,125,,
536,0.97,5193.454,5216.744,"Amendment one, technical changes, so changes to some of the language that is currently referred to as cases that could better be described as police reports, such as making more accurate the information and data asked and Affixing one Typo that made it through.",125,,
537,0.97,5216.744,5231.893,Amendment two would add in notice requirements you will see the language there on the slide on your screen and in the amendment circulated on the agenda.,125,,
538,0.97,5231.893,5246.374,The intent is to provide notice to the Council 90 days before implementing material changes to its diversion program that information isn't identified.,125,,
539,0.97,5246.374,5250.812,"If anyone has questions, I am happy to help answer those.",125,,
540,0.97,5250.812,5253.081,"Thank you, Asha.",126,,
541,0.97,5253.081,5255.016,I appreciate that.,126,,
542,0.97,5255.016,5259.921,Any questions?,126,,
543,0.97,5259.921,5264.626,Councilmember Lewis?,126,,
544,0.97,5264.626,5265.627,"Thank you, Madam chair.",127,,
545,0.97,5265.627,5298.326,"Asha, thank you for that overview . I want to ask as a matter of resources and putting recording requirements forward if any of the ads that the Council made in the last budget cycle are directly responsive to facilitating reports like this because I seem to recall some of the new positions we had to comply with reporting requests as part of the job description and they wondered if you could provide us with anything on that.",127,,
546,0.97,5298.326,5301.829,Sure.,128,,
547,0.97,5301.829,5302.63,That is no problem.,128,,
548,0.97,5302.63,5320.481,"This year the Council added additional positions to expand the program, but one of the changes to the budget in 2022 GOS to increase what would have been a halftime Paralegal position to a full-time Paralegal position.",128,,
549,0.97,5320.481,5345.907,"The increase in that position's workload as well as adding in four additional positions in the budget would allow the office not only to provide the one annual report they currently have been providing, but in addition allow them to provide additional information regarding the other elements of the program.",128,,
550,0.97,5345.907,5373.935,"Up until now, the office has been providing that annual report on the mainstream program but haven't had the staff were capacity to have consistent reporting on the drivers license suspended in the third degree program or the diversion program we started in 2021 related to a Non-Intimate partner domestic violence.",128,,
551,0.97,5373.935,5389.016,"If the Council does not decide to add in recording requirements in this legislation, they would have the capacity to provide those reports so this increase in staffing should allow that report to come through using that additional staff.",128,,
552,0.97,5389.016,5390.218,Thank you.,129,,
553,0.97,5390.218,5400.561,I just want to say a few words.,130,,
554,0.97,5400.561,5405.166,"The impact of this bill and what this bill does not do, if I could.",130,,
555,0.97,5405.166,5415.943,This bill does not in any way impact the lawful discretion vested in the city attorney about how cases are prosecuted.,130,,
556,0.97,5415.943,5434.395,This is really a piece of legislation as I understand it that is very focused on our oversight and accountability and transparency related to our budget authority.,130,,
557,0.97,5434.395,5457.819,"Councilmembers Lewis and president Gonzalez mentioned as we continue to make investments in these programs, we have increased the obligation that we have for transparency and accountability for these programs.",130,,
558,0.97,5457.819,5476.504,This is sort of an evolution of work that the Council has done dating all the way back to 2015 with the creation of the Seattle Reentry work group that the council voted to help establish.,130,,
559,0.97,5476.504,5493.754,That led to the Reentry work group report in 2018. they recommended expanding Prefiling diversion to folks that are 25 and older.,130,,
560,0.97,5493.754,5507.168,"As mentioned before, we have provided additional funding to expand the diversion program and, again, the Attorney has discretion over prosecution.",130,,
561,0.97,5507.168,5533.995,"We have heard from the city attorney elect that she has been briefed on the number of Unfiled cases . as they come in, they will consider how they will rightfully use their discretionary authority to decide how to act on these cases.",130,,
562,0.97,5533.995,5553.814,It is really important to note in the context of these Unfiled cases that 25% of the assistant city Prosecutor positions have become vacant since August and the office is under a lot of strain.,130,,
563,0.97,5553.814,5574.435,"Every new departure brings on very, very difficult decision making, whether it is to reassign someone away from to address these issues.",130,,
564,0.97,5574.435,5587.214,The city attorney elect has been invited to participate in interview panels so she can have a say in who next will work for the office.,130,,
565,0.97,5587.214,5594.722,They are not delaying that work until the new District Attorney takes office.,130,,
566,0.97,5594.722,5605.066,They have been working to fill those positions and understand the state attorney elect has adjoined for many of those.,130,,
567,0.97,5605.066,5613.441,They are continuing to extend the job posting window to select more applicants.,130,,
568,0.97,5613.441,5636.597,I think that is important context because the question of the case filing backlog is one that is likely to come up and this legislation as I understand it is not intended to influence or limit the discretion of the city attorney.,130,,
569,0.97,5636.597,5648.309,It is to really focus on the outcome of the investments the city has made in a program it has supported for many years now.,130,,
570,0.97,5648.309,5652.013,Council President Gonzalez?,130,,
571,0.97,5652.013,5663.424,"Thank you, chair Herbold . I wanted to make additional remarks now having sat through the presentation.",131,,
572,0.97,5663.424,5675.336,"Thank you, Asha, for your hard work on the ordinance . I wanted to spend some time emphasizing a point you heard chair Herbold make on discretion.",131,,
573,0.97,5675.336,5693.254,We as elected officials on the city council understand and appreciate the importance of Charter mandated duties . one of the Charter mandated duties is the attorney's office and does prosecutorial discretion in the attorney's office.,131,,
574,0.97,5693.254,5701.028,That office is going to exercise that prosecutorial discretion for the next city attorney.,131,,
575,0.97,5701.028,5719.914,"Nothing in this ordinance Impedes, Impinges upon, or modifies any portion of the Charter of prosecutorial discretion elected to that position.",131,,
576,0.97,5719.914,5729.123,I think it is important for members of the public to understand this ordinance does not modify any prosecutorial discretion.,131,,
577,0.97,5729.123,5749.977,Rather this ordinance simply acknowledges the city Council has funded the existing diversion programs as they are currently structured.,131,,
578,0.97,5749.977,5766.127,"Should there be changes that the next city attorney would like to consider, propose, or consistent with her charter responsibilities and duties, I believe that Council should be notified of those potential changes.",131,,
579,0.97,5766.127,5780.608,"Again, nothing in this ordinance prevents any city attorney current, past, former from making changes or proposing changes to the program.",131,,
580,0.97,5780.608,5793.954,It simply requires notice to the city council if those changes are about to be implemented . I think that a 90 day notice is completely reasonable.,131,,
581,0.97,5793.954,5842.503,"I think requiring a notice is completely reasonable and I think it is more than reasonable, it's appropriate to ask one of our city agencies to make sure that they are providing transparent data driven reports for us as a city council so we can be well informed of the effectiveness of said programs and so we have a clear understanding of whether the limited Fonda dollars are being utilized for the purpose intended and consistent with what we voted to approve in this last budget cycle and many budget cycles in the past.",131,,
582,0.97,5842.503,5880.341,"I just want to make clear that that is the motivation behind this ordinance and I hope folks will see this as a good governing tool to allow for us to have greater transparency and allow the Council to exercise oversight of programs we have funded without imposing any sort of restrictions or hindering discretion . Thank you, Madam chair.",131,,
583,0.97,5880.341,5883.744,Councilmember Pedersen?,132,,
584,0.97,5883.744,5887.047,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",133,,
585,0.97,5887.047,5898.158,"I am just an alternate today at this meeting, so I am Catchin up a little bit, just filling in for a Councilmember who is not able to attend.",133,,
586,0.97,5898.158,5938.899,"With this bill, I know we all recognize the benefits of effective programs that divert people from the traditional criminal justice system paths and what I am struggling with and of course I want the Department and other agencies who we provide funding to to implement our programs as we ask them to and there are all sorts of great programs that I would love to see the recording.",133,,
587,0.97,5938.899,5960.921,"I am struggling with why we would amend the Seattle municipal code to require basic reporting on one program when I have seen us ask for this and receive it in other ways, such as passing a state of legislative intent, sending a letter, picking up the phone, bringing it to the committee.",133,,
588,0.97,5960.921,5972.733,"I am struggling with the means by which we try to get this information, which is baking it into our core municipal code.",133,,
589,0.97,5972.733,5976.603,I am struggling with that.,133,,
590,0.97,5976.603,5978.439,I understand there are amendments.,133,,
591,0.97,5978.439,5984.745,I will engage with those . Thank you.,133,,
592,0.97,5984.745,5994.822,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen . is there interest in addressing the Western that Councilmember Pedersen asked?",134,,
593,0.97,5994.822,6004.231,I am happy to describe my intent if it is helpful to Councilmember Pedersen.,135,,
594,0.97,6004.231,6044.872,"Just sort of as a threshold question, as elected officials and policymakers, we have lots of different schools . We have resolutions, statements of legislative intent, council budget actions, and we also have the ability to pass legislation that then becomes an ordinance . We get to choose as legislators which tool would like to utilize to Memorialize and advance policy goals and intent of the city council.",135,,
595,0.97,6044.872,6053.781,"In this instance, I think it's important for us to create a new section in the Seattle municipal code because of the significant importance of diversion programs to the city.",135,,
596,0.97,6053.781,6057.017,We have been engaging in these diversion program since 2015.,135,,
597,0.97,6057.017,6081.408,All of the literature and studies say these are the most effective way to tackle Recidivism or in other words to make sure people aren't Re- engaging and becoming repeat offenders and engaging in the criminal justice system . I think it is an important step to Memorialize it as part of our legislative body.,135,,
598,0.97,6081.408,6092.753,I will just sort of note that the reason I feel an ordinance is important is because it has the effect of law and Emailed is not.,135,,
599,0.97,6092.753,6119.58,"Nor does a resolution . I do think it is important to make sure in an area in which we are investing millions and millions of dollars, we request minimal reporting to make sure this thing we are funding is actually occurring and occurring consistent with what we intended.",135,,
600,0.97,6119.58,6128.055,"We can certainly do this through the budget process, but I was told the quicker route would be to do it post budget.",135,,
601,0.97,6128.055,6151.311,"In full transparency, I was advocating for us to do this together with budget legislation and was told there wasn't an opportunity to do that, which is why we are dealing with it in the post budget legislative session context . I hope that is helpful.",135,,
602,0.97,6151.311,6154.681,I'm not sure it Persuades you but I'm happy to provide you with more clarity.,135,,
603,0.97,6154.681,6158.218,Councilmember Lewis?,136,,
604,0.97,6158.218,6162.089,Thank you.,137,,
605,0.97,6162.089,6174.434,The questions that Councilmember Pedersen RAISES are good . honestly I think we should report our Metrics more broadly across the city.,137,,
606,0.97,6174.434,6190.651,"I don't think reporting Metrics should be contingent on a particular chair or budget cycle or a particular, you know, era in our city's politics.",137,,
607,0.97,6190.651,6205.766,I think by putting recording Metrics into the code it creates consistency over time and helps us with baseline data over time.,137,,
608,0.97,6205.766,6218.946,I would add we had considered doing this budget legislation and that might be a good question for Asha . I don't recall what the issue was with that but that was my preferred course of action as well.,137,,
609,0.97,6218.946,6223.383,There were reasons this vehicle was more attractive.,137,,
610,0.97,6223.383,6239.299,"I would say there are other weird duties that the city attorney's office has that are manifested in different places, be a charter or municipal code.",137,,
611,0.97,6239.299,6255.916,"For example we get notice and executive session when several offers are about to be made, which is a strange requirement that the city attorney's office has.",137,,
612,0.97,6255.916,6260.787,It is a reporting and notice requirement that is similar to a lot of what we are requesting here.,137,,
613,0.97,6260.787,6270.931,"To a certain extent, what we are doing really is and that novel relative to other duties in the past.",137,,
614,0.97,6270.931,6280.34,I think I will leave it at that unless Asha has anything to add.,137,,
615,0.97,6280.34,6280.841,Sure.,138,,
616,0.97,6280.841,6285.145,I have two things.,138,,
617,0.97,6285.145,6288.548,"One, it was mainly a staffing capacity issue to be able to do that.",138,,
618,0.97,6288.548,6298.825,"The second thing I would add, there are a number of requirements throughout the Department and commissions and for a whole variety of purposes.",138,,
619,0.97,6298.825,6312.973,I did a quick search and we are looking at anything from transportation and Electrification to recycling to paid parental leave.,138,,
620,0.97,6312.973,6317.678,There are a lot of requirements embedded into the Seattle municipal code.,138,,
621,0.97,6317.678,6327.788,This as a reporting requirement isn't necessarily unusual or something to add to the code.,138,,
622,0.97,6327.788,6336.596,Lastly I will say the mechanisms we often use for budget tend to be annual asks.,138,,
623,0.97,6336.596,6364.991,"Rather than having your annual reporting this Council knows is coming in year after year, for budget purposes it comes down to legislative intent and Provisos . those are things that are snapshots in time of what is happening in the year we have asked for it rather than an annual set of information coming in from the Council to keep updated on.",138,,
624,0.97,6364.991,6370.197,I just have those as additional considerations.,138,,
625,0.97,6370.197,6380.607,"Thank you so much, Asha . I was going to add examples but I think you have covered it well.",139,,
626,0.97,6380.607,6387.714,That is not an unusual task to legislate.,139,,
627,0.97,6387.714,6409.369,"I know that we have a couple of amendments that I want to consider, so if it is okay with Councilmembers, I would like to get the bill before the committee if we have completed that initial discussion overview.",139,,
628,0.97,6409.369,6421.047,Sounds good . I am going to move Council bill 120247. is there a second?,139,,
629,0.97,6421.047,6421.448,Second.,140,,
630,0.97,6421.448,6423.083,Thank you.,141,,
631,0.97,6423.083,6447.874,"We now have Council bill 120247 before us . So now we have two amendments . Just checking Councilmember Lewis, will you address both of those amendments?",141,,
632,0.97,6447.874,6451.211,I believe one is sponsored by Council President Gonzalez.,142,,
633,0.97,6451.211,6454.548,My apologies.,143,,
634,0.97,6454.548,6454.748,Okay.,143,,
635,0.97,6454.748,6459.019,Amendment one is yours . I believe it is a technical amendment?,143,,
636,0.97,6459.019,6464.925,Yes and I would move amendment one here,144,,
637,0.97,6464.925,6466.426,Is there a second?,145,,
638,0.97,6466.426,6467.527,Second.,146,,
639,0.97,6467.527,6468.728,Thank you.,147,,
640,0.97,6468.728,6471.832,Any discussion?,147,,
641,0.97,6471.832,6476.903,I would like to address it.,147,,
642,0.97,6476.903,6477.337,County Lewis?,147,,
643,0.97,6477.337,6488.982,This is not a substitute amendment.,148,,
644,0.97,6488.982,6489.85,It is just a few changes.,148,,
645,0.97,6489.85,6493.954,I am happy to give Asha a moment to speak but it is my understanding there is no change.,148,,
646,0.97,6493.954,6494.554,Thank you.,149,,
647,0.97,6494.554,6495.622,Anything to add?,149,,
648,0.97,6495.622,6499.426,No? okay.,149,,
649,0.97,6499.426,6505.966,Will the clerk please call the roll on passage of amendment one?,149,,

651,0.97,6506.766,6507.367,Aye.,151,,

656,0.97,6513.373,6515.242,Sustained.,156,,
657,0.97,6515.242,6518.945,And chair Herbold?,157,,
658,0.97,6518.945,6519.346,Yes.,158,,
659,0.97,6519.346,6521.548,We have four Yeses.,159,,
660,0.97,6521.548,6529.756,The amendment is adopted.,160,,
661,0.97,6529.756,6536.596,"Moving on to amendment two, Council President Gonzalez, as sponsored would you like to move amendment two?",160,,
662,0.97,6536.596,6540.767,"Yes, I adopt to move two.",161,,
663,0.97,6540.767,6544.404,It has been moved and Seconded.,162,,
664,0.97,6544.404,6550.61,"Council President Gonzalez, you are recognized to address the court.",162,,
665,0.97,6550.61,6604.264,"I think Asha did a great job . This is a very simple addition to the 3.4 6.020 duties of the Seattle municipal code requiring the city's attorney's office will provide the city council with at least 90 days notification before it implements any material changes to the Prefiling diversion program including but not limited to changes in the eligibility parameters for individuals to qualify, changes in the type of offenses that are eligible for diversion and the changes in the Prefiling diversion model or how it is being administered . such information is not protected by the Attorney client work product.",163,,
666,0.97,6604.264,6644.471,"Really at its core, it is a simple amendment that would require some level of notice to the Council before any material changes are made to the Prefiling diversion programs so the Council, as I mentioned before, has the appropriation authority to evaluate whether or not supplemental budget actions will be necessary to ensure the dollars appropriated for the program via the city attorney's office are being used in a manner consistent with the Council's legislative intent.",163,,
667,0.97,6644.471,6645.505,Thank you so much.,164,,
668,0.97,6645.505,6647.907,Are there any additional comments on amendment number two?,164,,
669,0.97,6647.907,6649.109,County Lewis?,164,,
670,0.97,6649.109,6651.077,"Thank you, Madam chair.",165,,
671,0.97,6651.077,6673.633,"Just to speak to this amendment briefly, I think it is keeping with some of the notice requirements that are part of the duties of the city attorney's office and I spoke earlier about the notice we received prior to settlement offers in the civil cases during executive session.",165,,
672,0.97,6673.633,6693.153,"I would also add that maybe the sponsor could clarify on this, but this would involve material changes whether a program would become more permissive or more restrictive . either way, both would be important for the Council to know.",165,,
673,0.97,6693.153,6746.406,"For example, if the scope of crimes eligible for pretrial diversion is being inappropriately extended as a matter of policy, the public might be concerned about and in cases of extreme physical violence for example, it's not just envisioning a potential scenario of eligibility being more restricted but being more permissive . As we go into addressing the significant backlog, I think will be interesting policy discussions between members of the public, the Council, the city's attorney's office in some kind of notice and deliberation.",165,,
674,0.97,6746.406,6786.212,"I do appreciate the legislation or this amendment plays a limited role in what can be accomplished here around facilitating notice but reserving the city attorney's office has the full right has a supervisor of litigation to develop eligibility any way they see fit, which is a charter obligation for the city attorney that couldn't be infringed even if the Council wanted to infringe upon it and something we should be keen to remember as a potentially legislate in this area.",165,,
675,0.97,6786.212,6803.53,It preserves entirely that bedrock discretion and limits at to areas this Council has pursued in this office in the past.,165,,
676,0.97,6803.53,6805.365,"With that, I don't have anything else to add.",165,,
677,0.97,6805.365,6807.367,I will be voting in favor of this amendment today.,165,,
678,0.97,6807.367,6813.74,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",166,,
679,0.97,6813.74,6817.677,An important principle to underscore.,166,,
680,0.97,6817.677,6826.786,"Preserving eligibility for its own diversion programs, so really important to underscore that basic principle.",166,,
681,0.97,6826.786,6832.592,"Councilmember Pedersen, I saw your hand up?",166,,
682,0.97,6832.592,6832.792,No?,166,,
683,0.97,6832.792,6846.372,"Thank you, chair Herbold . I actually Abstained on the last one and I will be abstaining on this because I'm still trying to get comfortable with the concept.",167,,
684,0.97,6846.372,6848.007,I just wanted to provide a heads up.,167,,
685,0.97,6848.007,6849.008,Thank you so much.,168,,
686,0.97,6849.008,6850.677,There is no further discussion on the amendment.,168,,
687,0.97,6850.677,6853.746,Will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of amendment two?,168,,
688,0.97,6853.746,6856.983,"Amendment two, Council President Gonzalez?",169,,
689,0.97,6856.983,6858.318,Aye.,170,,
690,0.97,6858.318,6862.222,Chair Herbold?,171,,
691,0.97,6862.222,6865.692,Yes.,172,,

693,0.97,6867.727,6870.129,Thank you.,174,,
694,0.97,6870.129,6875.401,The amendment is adopted.,174,,
695,0.97,6875.401,6893.119,"Before we moved to discussion of the final motion before us and entertain a roll call vote on that, are there any additional comments on the bill?",175,,
696,0.97,6893.119,6893.62,Councilmember Pedersen?,175,,
697,0.97,6893.62,6895.255,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",176,,
698,0.97,6895.255,6920.546,"Colleagues, I am still trying and is struggling with the means by which we are trying to get this information and we have an unusual situation where we have an incoming city attorney who will be the one responsible for providing this information and it's not clear to me what sort of collaboration or information exchange has occurred with her on this.",176,,
699,0.97,6920.546,6930.49,"I am thinking that because we would be amending the Seattle municipal code to do this, it would benefit from additional time.",176,,
700,0.97,6930.49,6939.232,Just a few more weeks to perhaps talk with the incoming city attorney and her team about this and how it will be implemented.,176,,
701,0.97,6939.232,6949.776,It sets a good Precedet for a newly elected official.,176,,
702,0.97,6949.776,6955.081,"Pursuant to our Council rules, I wanted to make a motion to postpone or withhold to a certain time in the future.",176,,
703,0.97,6955.081,6966.626,Specifically I would move to hold Council bill 120240 until next year in the public safety committee.,176,,
704,0.97,6966.626,6971.531,Thank you.,177,,
705,0.97,6971.531,6975.935,I will second that motion for further discussion.,177,,
706,0.97,6975.935,6987.547,"Councilmember Pedersen, any further remarks to your interest in holding this item?",177,,
707,0.97,6987.547,6993.086,I thank you for letting me have a long introduction to the motion.,178,,
708,0.97,6993.086,6994.687,I feel I got my point out there.,178,,
709,0.97,6994.687,6995.521,Thank you.,178,,
710,0.97,6995.521,6997.523,County Lewis?,179,,
711,0.97,6997.523,6999.025,"Thank you, Madam chair.",180,,
712,0.97,6999.025,7006.966,Opportunity to talk about this request.,180,,
713,0.97,7006.966,7023.249,"To withhold to colleagues is reasonable to give more time to deliberate a certain issue, especially if there has been an issue spotted in areas for additional work.",180,,
714,0.97,7023.249,7033.693,I frankly don't think this is an area where I think that holds for me.,180,,
715,0.97,7033.693,7052.512,I have not been presented with or pitched on any substantive changes to the legislation either from the city attorney elect Consul colleagues or other Stakeholders that have approached me where I don't know the bill will change all that much if it is delayed.,180,,
716,0.97,7052.512,7063.589,"Given that, I don't think I'll support a motion to hold, although I do respect the spirit in which it is being brought.",180,,
717,0.97,7063.589,7099.826,"I would add that this bill was shared with the city attorney elect on Thursday, December 2ND, the day before it was put on introduction referral and a several days before it was published . Monday of this week we discussed the bill extensively . It is not something we have been trying to keep secret frankly since discussions began in August.",180,,
718,0.97,7099.826,7108.367,"I did have a great meeting in person with the city attorney elect on Tuesday, December 7th.",180,,
719,0.97,7108.367,7115.374,It was a great way to get acquainted and talk about relations between the Council and the city attorney's office.,180,,
720,0.97,7115.374,7124.05,It was a very cordial meeting and it was good to be able to build that rapport with someone who will be our attorney.,180,,
721,0.97,7124.05,7137.263,We will be the clients for the next four years and it was good to have that in person meeting.,180,,
722,0.97,7137.263,7179.705,"We did discuss the bill in the meeting and while it was expressed there was a desire to hold the bill, there were no substantive changes recommended in that meeting from the city attorney elect . On Wednesday, December 8th, yesterday chair Herbold and I invited the city attorney elect to be involved in this process as much as she wants to express changes she wants to see . I continue today regardless of what we do whether this is held or voted out, there will be several days before we consider it at the December 13th meeting or consider it sometime next year if we decide to hold it at all Council.",180,,
723,0.97,7179.705,7188.047,I do continued to have the substantive recommendations to change the reporting requirements.,180,,
724,0.97,7188.047,7211.938,"And would Dually consider them, but because I have not heard any substantive areas for change, I don't know how productive holding the bill will be so for those reasons, I will not be voting for those today.",180,,
725,0.97,7211.938,7285.945,"I ordinarily also respect when individual Councilmembers request a hold on a particular bill again in this particular instance, I think what I am hearing as a primary objection from Councilmember Pedersen and he doesn't think there should be an ordinance and that effectively means killing the bill and I just don't think that sort of the issues related to the vehicles are going to be resolved if as a threshold matter Councilmember Pedersen agrees it should be in an ordinance, which is what I heard him say or Insinuate or infer a couple of times . I am Inferring that he does not believe that this policy goal should be advanced through an ordinance and I feel really strongly it should be for the reasons that I stated previously.",181,,
726,0.97,7285.945,7347.306,"I also will say that this piece of legislation is not representative of a substantive policy change . It is quite literally a simple ordinance that imposes recording requirements of specific kinds of information from the city as it is not changed which would be very substantive and inconsistent with what we can do under the law, nor does it encumber the duties of the city attorney's office, so I like County Lewis cannot support the purpose to hold . We should get this out of committee and over the finish line for full Council to consider on Monday.",181,,
727,0.97,7347.306,7350.109,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez.",182,,
728,0.97,7350.109,7374.633,"Because I am supportive of the use of motions to hold when there are substantial policy issues in getting that extra time, I'm not hearing that being the issue here and again I want to underscore what has been said.",182,,

767,0.97,7609.868,7633.892,Yolanda's memo does a great job covering the background including the Council's request back in 2012 for draft recommendations . that led to the creation of the Urm policy committee who released their final in 2017.,204,,
768,0.97,7633.892,7672.297,"Before getting into introductions and handing it over to Yolanda to lead us through the presentation, I want to note that in February of 2018, members of what was then the planning and zoning committee sent a letter to Mayor Durkan underscoring the urgency and need to Prioritize a Urm policy in order to prevent catastrophic loss of life when, not if, the next major earthquake strikes.",204,,
769,0.97,7672.297,7679.405,Specifically the committee requested to focus on the 77 buildings with critical vulnerability first including hospitals and fire stations.,204,,

776,0.97,7739.498,7744.403,Thank you.,207,,
777,0.97,7744.403,7746.405,"All right, Yolanda, do you want to kick us off?",207,,
778,0.97,7746.405,7760.018,I will commence sharing my screen here and I will be walking you through this presentation and invite director Nathan Torgelson and curry Mayer to Chime in.,208,,
779,0.97,7760.018,7763.922,Okay.,208,,
780,0.97,7763.922,7764.756,Let's get everything situated here.,208,,
781,0.97,7764.756,7768.193,"All right, the screen looks okay?",208,,
782,0.97,7768.193,7777.736,It does.,209,,
783,0.97,7777.736,7797.656,"All right, so in this presentation we will cover the background, provide an overview of the city's policy, development related to Unreinforced masonry buildings, commonly referred to as Urms and I will be referring to them as such during this presentation . I will describe what is in resolution 32033.",210,,
784,0.97,7797.656,7819.945,So Urms are buildings that were constructed prior to the 1950s using brick or clay tile where the walls are not secured to the floors and roofs . This image on the slide shows what could happen during an earthquake to a Urm that has not been Retrofitted compared to one that has.,210,,
785,0.97,7819.945,7827.419,On Retrofitted Urms are particularly damaged during earthquakes.,210,,
786,0.97,7827.419,7836.628,They can be dangerous to people within the building and endanger people outside the building on the adjacent sidewalk or Street if it breaks away and falls into the public Right-Of-Way.,210,,
787,0.97,7836.628,7841.667,This could result in blocking the ways Impeding emergency response.,210,,
788,0.97,7841.667,7857.583,"Seattle has over 1100 Urms in more than 50 neighborhoods with the highest concentrations in Capitol Hill, Pioneer square, and the Chinese district.",210,,
789,0.97,7857.583,7860.185,Earthquakes are Seattle's most serious hazard based on likelihood and potential Destructiveness.,210,,
790,0.97,7860.185,7880.939,"In the most recent earthquake that impact Seattle, the Nisqually earthquake was in 2001 and injured 400 people and caused around $2 million in property damage which included $8 million in repair costs to Urms in Seattle.",210,,
791,0.97,7880.939,7886.211,"In the event's aftermath, 31 buildings were too dangerous to enter.",210,,
792,0.97,7886.211,7906.732,"In 2017, the Seattle Department of instruction and office of emergency management reported to Council that Seattle has an 86% risk of being hit by another 6.8 magnitude earthquake and a 33% chance of 8.0 magnitude earthquake in the next 50 years.",210,,
793,0.97,7906.732,7924.983,"On this slide, I am just putting that we maintain a list of confirmed Urms and each building is classified on height, occupancy type, or soil conditions.",210,,
794,0.97,7924.983,7927.152,This table shows a number in each classification.,210,,
795,0.97,7927.152,7933.892,Over three-quarters fall into the medium risk category.,210,,
796,0.97,7933.892,7940.999,"A small percentage are in the critical risk, which as chair Herbold noted, hospitals, fire stations, schools.",210,,
797,0.97,7940.999,7949.574,Arrest or categorized as high risk.,210,,
798,0.97,7949.574,7962.12,"So the next couple of slides, I will just provide some highlights to address potential hazards posed by Urms.",210,,
799,0.97,7962.12,7988.947,"This has issued back to the 1970s when the Council adopted structural standards for all Urms, which were later repealed it due to financial barriers which continue to be a threat throughout the policy development up to today . In 2008, the city convened at two committees, a technical committee and policy committee to propose a cost effective Urm retrofit Standard and accompanying implementation program.",210,,
800,0.97,7988.947,8000.759,"Three years later, adoption of a standard known as bolts plus.",210,,
801,0.97,8000.759,8015.407,The policy committee was unable to provide a recommendation for an implementation program merrily due to the cost associated with implementing the standard and implemented by the technical committee.,210,,
802,0.97,8015.407,8024.483,"Following this initial unsuccessful attempt to create a framework for a mandatory Urm program, the Council requested they reconvene a new policy Committee in 2012.",210,,
803,0.97,8024.483,8029.755,This policy committee issued a draft recommendations in January of 2013.,210,,
804,0.97,8029.755,8051.51,"Departments began to do more work on this topic to help inform the committee's final recommendations by conducting an analysis, developing Urms, engagement strategies in the Columbia city neighborhood.",210,,
805,0.97,8051.51,8069.661,"So the policy committee issued its final recommendation in 2017 proposing a Timeline of 7, 10, or 13 years based on building vulnerability and they also proposed a process for prior requirements.",210,,
806,0.97,8069.661,8089.114,"Recognizing this is a barrier for cost of seismic upgrades, the city produced a funding Urm retrofit report released in May of 2019 which identified potential funding and financing mechanisms.",210,,
807,0.97,8089.114,8104.663,Report estimated fewer than 1000 privately owned Urms would require seismic upgrades to make them standard for a total cost of about $1.28 billion.,210,,
808,0.97,8105.73,8124.883,"More recently, last year the Washington state Legislature passed and the government signed into law House bill 24005 which established a monetary commercial property for clean energy, also known as C-Pacer.",210,,
809,0.97,8130.021,8133.024,This creates multifamily buildings and helps cover the cost of energy efficiency and seismic Retrofits.,210,,
810,0.97,8133.024,8154.713,"This was enclosed in the 2019 report . As authorized by the state, King County Council recently adopted a framework for the program and anticipates opening the program for applications in 2022.",210,,
811,0.97,8154.713,8198.623,"Finally, the 2022 adopted budget includes a new position in the Seattle Department of construction and inspections to lead development for mandatory Urm program . any questions or anything? all right, so moving onto resolution 32033, this represents a shared commitment by the Council and the Mayor to take the steps necessary to establish a phased program for Urms . This is intended to provide guidance to city departments as they develop the program and the legislation was drafted in collaboration with staff and the Mayor's office and office of emergency management.",210,,
812,0.97,8198.623,8267.425,"It would establish the following goals as noted on this slide . First and foremost, protecting life safety by risking reducing the risk of injury from collapse of Urms in the event of an earthquake and improving Seattle's resiliency to earthquake events so you recover more quickly, and finally minimizing the impact of a Urm retrofit on vulnerable populations to the extent that is financially feasible . for the program itself, it would include these aspects but not limited to that . providing a definition, identifying which retrofit standard applies to each Urm, recognizing that will vary on the type of building . also providing categorizing building types and Prioritize key buildings and services, setting up a Timeline for compliance based on building type and other factors, enforcement, and also funding opportunities and financial incentives to help make things happen.",210,,
813,0.97,8267.425,8293.251,And the next slide is just specific questions to create the program that are listed on the slide here I will describe in more detail on the legislation itself here I will not red through all of those but it will include coordination across multiple departments and private building owners as well as community engagement and building owners and tenants throughout the entire process.,210,,
814,0.97,8293.251,8312.17,"Some city departments would include the Department of neighborhoods who would submit Retrofits of Urms, the office of housing to work with affordable House Kate located in Urms.",210,,
815,0.97,8312.17,8354.212,But also the Department who have city owned Urms . We know that some of the Urms are owned by public schools and private schools need to be collaborated with those entities . an important strategy cited during public comment was mitigating the impact of the retrofit program and specifically in regards to causing displacement as building owners increase their commercial and residential rent to pay for the retrofit.,210,,
816,0.97,8354.212,8359.718,One of my final stepson process would be submitting legislation to the counts that would establish the program.,210,,
817,0.97,8359.718,8375.533,"The resolution requests that the Seattle Department of construction and inspections office of emergency management and other departments as needed provide a quarterly report to the Council beginning on August 1ST, 2022.",210,,
818,0.97,8375.533,8379.604,"Thank you, Yolanda.",211,,
819,0.97,8379.604,8385.243,Director Torgelson and Mayer?,211,,
820,0.97,8385.243,8397.655,I just really want to thank the Mayor and the Council for your support for additional staffing we can get going with the program.,212,,
821,0.97,8397.655,8414.272,"While I'm not excited about a future earthquake, I am very excited to get this program going . for the viewing public, I just want to emphasize that we are not going to put mandatory standards in place next year.",212,,
822,0.97,8414.272,8442.367,"I know the policy committee and other groups that have been very engaged, and I wanted to call out Peter and Lisa who have talked about graduated phasing process depending on the categories critical, high risk, or medium . One protocol that was suggested was a 7, 10, 13 compliance period.",212,,
823,0.97,8442.367,8451.309,Thank you for that level of detail . that was really important for the public to hear.,213,,
824,0.97,8451.309,8461.486,"This is really beginning the process of development of program that would be mandatory . at some point in the future, so thank you for that.",213,,
825,0.97,8461.486,8463.888,Director Mayer?,213,,
826,0.97,8463.888,8468.326,Thank you.,214,,
827,0.97,8468.326,8508.166,"I would like to thank you, chair Herbold, for your leadership in this and pushing us forward and getting the support not only from the city but from all of our private sector partners and, you know, my job is usually the one person who calls out all of the scary things people don't want to talk about, so I am really thankful the committee is looking at this and setting out a phased approach on how we can best help people in the city of Seattle and I really see this program as a model for the rest of the West Coast.",214,,
828,0.97,8508.166,8513.771,This is an issue up and down the West Coast all the way down the coast of California.,214,,
829,0.97,8513.771,8533.157,"San Francisco and Portland have been struggling with Urms, just like we have for quite some time and nobody has been able to put in a program at this level of detail with this level of private partnership and with this phased approach.",214,,
830,0.97,8533.157,8541.299,I am really thankful we are doing that in Seattle.,214,,
831,0.97,8541.299,8543.301,I am not surprised because we always do things better.,214,,
832,0.97,8543.301,8545.803,I am thankful for the private sector partners who were on today.,214,,
833,0.97,8545.803,8572.13,"I look forward to working with you with all of the details on how we make this work for everyone and how we also protect vulnerable populations who are most affected by Urms not only by doing the seismic retrofitting, but the process because there are a lot of things that need to happen along the way so I look forward to working with you on that.",214,,
834,0.97,8572.13,8580.438,It is really a great example of the work the government can do in partnership with the private sector.,214,,
835,0.97,8580.438,8587.345,I'm also looking forward to working with Nathan and his team on the city's portion on how we make this work.,214,,
836,0.97,8587.345,8587.745,Thank you.,214,,
837,0.97,8587.745,8592.45,"Thank you, director Mayor.",215,,

841,0.97,8612.737,8655.213,"And thank you, Mayer, for including it . I am excited to get this conversation going in preparation for, you know, what most people see as an inevitable need and really appreciate the enthusiasm of everybody involved and recognizing that Seattle is often groundbreaking in historic policy development and this will be no different, I'm confident.",215,,
842,0.97,8655.213,8668.993,"I know we have an amendment we want to get in front of us . If there are no objections to that, I want to get that going, if that's okay.",215,,
843,0.97,8668.993,8680.405,"All right, I move resolution 32033.",215,,
844,0.97,8680.405,8704.562,I move amendment one as described via the Email yesterday which provides clarity that PDAS will be able to provide resources and coaching to owners of Urms because some of the PDAS have really good experience already.,215,,
845,0.97,8704.562,8706.564,Is there a second?,215,,
846,0.97,8706.564,8714.972,Second.,216,,

880,0.97,8828.085,8845.97,"Council bill 120248, an ordinance relating to city employment; creating a compensation program for the position of fire chief; specifying provisions for the administration of said compensation program; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",239,,
881,0.97,8845.97,8847.038,Thank you.,240,,
882,0.97,8847.038,8855.68,Let's turn it right over to our Presenters for a quick round of introductions.,240,,
883,0.97,8855.68,8863.821,Your name and affiliation and we will move into the presentation.,240,,
884,0.97,8863.821,8864.655,"Good morning, everybody.",241,,
885,0.97,8864.655,8867.291,"This is Kimberly loving, the owner of hr director city.",241,,
886,0.97,8867.291,8870.695,"Good morning, Council members . or good afternoon.",242,,
887,0.97,8870.695,8878.87,I am senior deputy Mayor Shefali Ranganathan.,242,,
888,0.97,8878.87,8883.908,I am Alaina Goodman.,243,,
889,0.97,8883.908,8894.218,Karina Bull.,244,,
890,0.97,8901.959,8904.862,All right.,245,,
891,0.97,8904.862,8906.264,Who would like to start?,245,,
892,0.97,8906.264,8919.477,I can kick it off and my colleagues cannot walk through the presentation if we can just pull that up.,246,,
893,0.97,8919.477,8927.385,"I will just, you know, first thank you all for the opportunity to be here.",246,,
894,0.97,8927.385,8934.692,"Councilmember Herbold, I want to thank you for your partnership in helping us get this on the calendar.",246,,
895,0.97,8934.692,8965.323,"We are here to discuss the proposed fire chief compensation program . First I would be Remiss if I did not acknowledge the outstanding work of the Seattle fire Department during the past few years . They have been at the front edge of the pandemic response and also as we have dealt with multiple crises in the city including closures of the West Seattle bridge and other challenges, they have really been there every step of the way.",246,,
896,0.97,8965.323,8984.709,The goal is to hire and retain the most talent and the best talent we can find to serve our city and nowhere is that more exemplified at Seattle's fire.,246,,
897,0.97,8984.709,9015.706,"We have seen their responsibilities grow and expand as they have kept up with testing, vaccination, and an increasing role in the crisis response . However their compensation structure hasn't quite kept up with the reality that the role of fire has expanded in . We are no longer competitive with our comparable cities along the West Coast in terms of wage and salary and it has also created oppression in the fire Department.",246,,
898,0.97,9015.706,9029.387,This ordinance seeks to establish a new fire chief compensation program which we believe will address issues that are highlighted.,246,,
899,0.97,9029.387,9036.494,We launched a review earlier this year to prepare analysis to really think about how we could structure the program.,246,,
900,0.97,9036.494,9038.896,Alaina Goodman will walk us through that analysis.,246,,
901,0.97,9038.896,9053.577,Kimberly or I or Alaina are happy to answer any questions you may have.,246,,
902,0.97,9053.577,9061.485,"All right, well I am here to present the data we found during the salary survey for the fire chief compensation program.",247,,
903,0.97,9061.485,9062.52,This is a short agenda.,247,,
904,0.97,9062.52,9069.66,"We will go to the summary of the request, current state of the plan, overview of the salary survey we did, and the proposed compensation plan.",247,,
905,0.97,9069.66,9078.102,"So, as mentioned earlier, there was an issue with the current pay band as it is.",247,,
906,0.97,9078.102,9090.748,"The salary of the fire chief is part of the core band along with the deputy fire chief, so they are currently in the same hand.",247,,
907,0.97,9090.748,9096.821,"Sorry, I jumped ahead.",247,,
908,0.97,9096.821,9104.128,Here is the executive band.,247,,
909,0.97,9104.128,9111.268,There is less than a 4% difference between the deputy fire chief's salary in the fire chief's salary because they are in the same pay band.,247,,
910,0.97,9111.268,9126.283,"The fire chief's salary is lagging midpoint of market . The fire chief's salary is at the Max of the executive band, so there is no room for movement.",247,,
911,0.97,9126.283,9140.698,So we went through our usual process to review the West Coast cities that we prepare executives to.,247,,
912,0.97,9140.698,9149.206,The current pay for fire Chiefs is very low compared to comparable cities across the West Coast.,247,,
913,0.97,9149.206,9163.02,We did survey these cities into a geographic adjustment on that data so it is geographically adjusted based on how that salary would be in Seattle.,247,,
914,0.97,9163.02,9186.81,Our proposal is to put the salary for fire chiefs and their own compensation band . We are proposing this band to eliminate issues with the fire chief and the current band . We will no longer be lagging the market with the West Coast cities we compare it to.,247,,
915,0.97,9186.81,9195.853,This is a range spread of 60% so it provides flexibility over time.,247,,
916,0.97,9195.853,9203.06,And that is the end.,247,,
917,0.97,9203.06,9207.531,Thank you so much.,248,,
918,0.97,9207.531,9210.768,Just a couple quick questions.,248,,
919,0.97,9210.768,9218.242,Can you just give us a little more detail on what makes the seven cities comparable to Seattle?,248,,
920,0.97,9218.242,9236.16,"When you are doing salary surveys, it is important to stick with a standard, a standard a city has used for years to compare executives' salaries to.",249,,
921,0.97,9236.16,9241.665,"San Francisco, San Diego, Oakland, long Beach, Sacramento, San Jose, and Portland.",249,,
922,0.97,9241.665,9247.271,These are cities that are Comparale in size and services we provide.,249,,
923,0.97,9247.271,9256.614,"And so the general size of the Department, the fire Department in those cities are also comparable?",250,,
924,0.97,9256.614,9265.222,"Like I said, we use a standard when looking at any executive salaries.",251,,
925,0.97,9265.222,9270.894,We assume so because it is a comparable size.,251,,
926,0.97,9270.894,9272.93,We didn't get into detail about the fire Department size.,251,,
927,0.97,9272.93,9279.436,"San Francisco is Countywide, so their Department is actually much larger.",252,,
928,0.97,9279.436,9284.308,"It is about 1400 or so compared to fire, which is closer to 1000.",252,,
929,0.97,9284.308,9293.55,Their service area is larger than the city of Seattle.,252,,
930,0.97,9293.55,9310.534,"And one thing I want to flag, the legislation itself is retroactive to 2021. can you explain the purpose of that?",253,,
931,0.97,9310.534,9310.934,Sure.,254,,
932,0.97,9310.934,9325.449,"I think part of this, and you know I talked a little bit at the beginning about a goal around town for retention just recognizing that in 2020 and 2021, Seattle fire has been called to take an extraordinary role in the pandemic response.",254,,
933,0.97,9325.449,9330.788,Particularly around both testing and vaccination.,254,,
934,0.97,9330.788,9336.694,That role is quick to fire.,254,,
935,0.97,9336.694,9362.92,"What we wanted to acknowledge is that, you know, while we are addressing this now and it is somewhat lagging, our intention was to always try to do this and be responsible to expand the scope and recognize these salaries, the band itself has been stagnant for quite some time.",254,,
936,0.97,9362.92,9373.497,"We are seeking to do some of that retroactively because the pandemic dropped some of the work we wanted to do prior to where we are now, which is December of 2021.",254,,
937,0.97,9373.497,9385.442,All right . are there any other questions from my colleagues?,255,,
938,0.97,9385.442,9391.148,I am not seeing any questions.,255,,
939,0.97,9391.148,9392.182,Given that --,255,,
940,0.97,9392.182,9422.88,"Councilmember, this is Kimberly loving . I don't have any questions but I want to certainly echo the deputy Mayor and reiterate and underscore our degree of confidence as a classification compensation team within the city and just that we feel very strongly that this is the right thing to do.",256,,
941,0.97,9422.88,9426.083,"Thank you, Kimberly loving.",257,,
942,0.97,9426.083,9429.486,I appreciate that.,257,,
943,0.97,9429.486,9470.928,"I appreciate the chief's service throughout the years and certainly through these challenging times . I appreciate that as we go through a transition in Mayors, the question of longevity becomes one of concern and I certainly want to make sure we are within the Constructs of what is comparable pay that we are providing that recognizes that work and commitment.",257,,
944,0.97,9470.928,9497.354,"That makes Seattle a competitive environment to continue to do this work . So, not seeing any questions or comments from my colleagues, so I am going to move Council bill 120248. is there a second?",257,,
945,0.97,9497.354,9497.754,Second.,258,,
946,0.97,9497.754,9503.861,Thank you.,259,,
947,0.97,9503.861,9513.437,"I am just asking if there are any further comments on the bill? seeing no further comments, will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill?",259,,
948,0.97,9513.437,9514.671,Council President Gonzalez?,260,,
949,0.97,9514.671,9515.272,Aye.,261,,

958,0.97,9542.299,9545.102,It was great to see many of you I haven't seen for a while.,267,,
