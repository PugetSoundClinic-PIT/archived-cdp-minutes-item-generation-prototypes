76,0.97,460.159,473.673,I consider myself an expert . I am here to say that every time we add cost to the building of a house in Seattle it absolutely increases the sales price.,4,,

84,0.97,540.206,549.048,We are running into a brick wall on being able to strive to build affordable housing.,4,,
85,0.97,549.048,554.287,"A lot of us in the Townhouse industry, that is what we like to do, we like to get people into homes as Affordably as possible.",4,,

93,0.97,574.907,580.98,Thank you . I want to comment on the commercial energy code.,8,,
94,0.97,580.98,588.921,When future historians look back at our time they're going to be seeing two issues that they're going to comment on how well did we respond.,8,,
95,0.97,588.921,595.394,The pandemic will have been forgotten as the Spanish flu.,8,,
96,0.97,595.394,597.129,So will many of the other things we worry about today.,8,,
97,0.97,597.129,603.936,There will be two things they will look back on and say how well did we do?,8,,
98,0.97,603.936,606.105,"The first, ""of course, is how well did we respond to Ben Franklin's challenge.",8,,
99,0.97,606.105,608.808,You have a Republic if you can keep it.,8,,
100,0.97,608.808,615.815,That is now a challenging effort for us and we need to respond to it.,8,,
101,0.97,615.815,622.388,The other that we really need to respond to is how aggressively did we respond to the challenge of global warming?,8,,
102,0.97,622.388,628.661,Did we have the courage to do the very difficult things that need to be done to actually make a difference?,8,,
103,0.97,628.661,633.566,We need at this point to adopt the Seattle commercial energy code.,8,,
104,0.97,633.566,644.276,There are many updates in it that will help us use our energy more efficiently and ultimately reduce our release of greenhouse gases.,8,,
105,0.97,644.276,645.878,We need to make two amendments to the code.,8,,
106,0.97,645.878,652.385,One is to remove the delay for buildings to use efficient electricity for space heating.,8,,
107,0.97,652.385,656.722,You have received detailed written comments on this from various people.,8,,
108,0.97,656.722,669.735,The second is that we need to amend the code to require efficient electricity for water heating for all buildings.,8,,
109,0.97,669.735,670.77,And not just hotels and multifamily buildings.,8,,
110,0.97,670.77,672.805,"Again, you have received detailed written comments from a variety of folks detailing this.",8,,
111,0.97,672.805,681.914,Thank you very much for your attention and your courage to do what needs to be done.,8,,
112,0.97,681.914,682.481,"Thank you, Michael.",9,,

131,0.97,758.791,772.271,"We understand the urgency to implement current proposal, we have serious concerns regarding job loss to our members and believe that natural gas is a reliable and affordable part of a balanced clean energy future.",12,,
132,0.97,772.271,780.112,By limiting natural gas as a safe resource to all commercial buildings in Seattle may be creating consequences.,12,,
133,0.97,780.112,788.22,"Currently, the state legislator is considering several bills related to heat pumps and Hydrofluorocarbons related to those.",12,,
134,0.97,788.22,798.631,By implementing legislation of the propose legislation it will create a great burden on the construction industry.,12,,

151,0.97,886.952,888.153,To that end we would like to share the following.,15,,
152,0.97,888.153,893.325,"First, many of the improvements to code bring energy and financial savings to residents nd building owners and pay for themselves over time.",15,,
153,0.97,893.325,910.643,"Second, the code writers worked with the affordable housing community to adapt the codes to affordable housing's unique needs and requirements, allowing less than the electric resistance space heating to heat the smaller efficient units that are typical in our affordable housing.",15,,

185,0.97,1053.952,1063.295,I would like to recommend to you a fascinating and powerful article published last week in the New York intelligence magazine entitled life after warnings.,19,,
186,0.97,1063.295,1067.366,It's really worth reading.,19,,
187,0.97,1067.366,1073.705,The most thing I learned from that article is that delay matters.,19,,
188,0.97,1073.705,1081.847,Today we are 1.2 degrees centigrade above Preindustrial levels.,19,,
189,0.97,1081.847,1089.822,1.2 degrees we are already experiencing global warming that has had an impact on Seattle and far greater impact than other parts of the world.,19,,
190,0.97,1089.822,1102.434,Our plan and has a carbon budget which equals the maximum amount of carbon we can add to the atmosphere if we hope to avoid a temperature increase of more than 1.5 degrees centigrade.,19,,
191,0.97,1102.434,1108.24,Every year every day of delay Expends more of the carbon budget.,19,,
192,0.97,1108.24,1116.682,Every delay in the application of a new carbon saving improvement in energy code Expends more of the carbon budget.,19,,
193,0.97,1116.682,1122.621,At the current level of admissions we will exhaust our carbon budget in this world in seven years.,19,,
194,0.97,1122.621,1123.555,I didn't know that.,19,,
195,0.97,1123.555,1127.059,Seven years.,19,,
196,0.97,1127.059,1133.765,Scientists estimate in order to hold to 1.5 degrees we would need to reach zero emissions by 2035.,19,,
197,0.97,1133.765,1137.97,"Currently, Seattle's goal is to reach zero emissions by 2050.",19,,
198,0.97,1137.97,1144.843,We cannot afford any delay in effective policies that will reduce emissions now.,19,,
199,0.97,1144.843,1161.293,That is why the 43rd Democratic environmental caucus and many others are urging you to Delete the revision in the proposed building code amendments that would delay implementing the use of efficient electricity for space heating.,19,,
200,0.97,1161.293,1162.394,Delay matters.,19,,
201,0.97,1162.394,1164.096,Thank you very much.,19,,

212,0.97,1221.153,1223.455,Has failed to pop quiz.,21,,
213,0.97,1223.455,1229.962,Climate change brings death and economic devastation.,21,,
214,0.97,1229.962,1230.596,If it is not addressed now.,21,,
215,0.97,1230.596,1242.474,I'm encouraged by statements from the new Biden administration that it would treat the climate crisis as an emergency that it is and that every agency is now a part of our climate.,21,,
216,0.97,1242.474,1253.852,I'm asking you to make every agency in the city of Seattle government become a part of your climate team.,21,,
217,0.97,1253.852,1254.987,This brings us to the matter before your Committee.,21,,
218,0.97,1254.987,1264.396,I urge you to pass the Seattle energy code update to increase energy efficiency and reduce climate pollution from commercial and large multifamily buildings.,21,,
219,0.97,1264.396,1272.104,And also urge you to pass amendments being introduced to increase its impact and make sure it makes a difference sooner.,21,,
220,0.97,1272.104,1281.079,"No delay in efficient electric space heating requiring efficient electric water, heating for all commercial buildings . or at lease those with high water usage.",21,,
221,0.97,1281.079,1295.494,In Seattle buildings contribute all about one third of the city's pollution . due to the urgency of this crisis and the fact that Seattle is falling behind on its goals we need concrete action now.,21,,
222,0.97,1295.494,1312.044,"Therefore, I urge you to coordinate this policy with existing and new city workforce moment programs focusing on increasing equitable access and opportunity and align city and technical supports to this code toward affordable housing.",21,,
223,0.97,1312.044,1317.516,Passing the Seattle commercial energy code is a concrete step that we can do now.,21,,
224,0.97,1317.516,1321.119,"Thank you, rich.",22,,
225,0.97,1321.119,1324.756,"Cynthia, your next followed by Eric.",23,,

249,0.97,1436.535,1447.946,"I have also served as the master builders Association President, Seattle builders Council and have been a guest Speaker at the Uw school of real estate.",29,,
250,0.97,1447.946,1450.949,I found it Ashworth homes over 20 years ago with the purpose of building Townhomes in the city of Seattle where I was born and raised.,29,,
251,0.97,1450.949,1454.219,Since then we have constructed over 400 homes.,29,,
252,0.97,1454.219,1463.295,We have purposely focused on what has recently become called the missing middle housing market.,29,,
253,0.97,1463.295,1481.079,"I know you be voting on the technical code updates today, which are necessary and often mundane process of keeping a city's respective codes with state, Federal, and international coast.",29,,
254,0.97,1481.079,1483.348,Most of these updates have been in the process for long time and their approval is all but guaranteed.,29,,
255,0.97,1483.348,1485.65,I have no misconception that these codes will be approved as they are presented today.,29,,
256,0.97,1485.65,1506.137,"Rather, my purpose in speaking to you today is to raise the alarms to keep would've costs layered on Townhomes specifically by things like Mha, utility main extensions, curb ramp replacement, street improvements, exclusive bike parking, trash facilities, and so on.",29,,

258,0.97,1512.177,1520.552,We have gone from having approximately 50 per year in our development pipeline down to zero.,29,,
259,0.97,1520.552,1526.958,"We aren't even looking to acquire land that could be developed into Townhomes, because it's ugly doesn't work any longer.",29,,
260,0.97,1526.958,1530.562,I would like to draw your attention to 2 specific impacts in the codes you will be approving today.,29,,
261,0.97,1530.562,1534.933,One is the energy code and the second is fire Sprinklers.,29,,
262,0.97,1534.933,1549.08,"While we are supportive of the more Energy-Efficient buildings the cost associated with the energy code is someone between $5000 and $25,000.",29,,

287,0.97,1644.175,1644.743,This is Holly town.,35,,
288,0.97,1644.743,1656.588,"I am a mechanical engineer . I urge you to support the Seattle energy code, plus the in the mid to not delay the restrictions on using fossil fuel for space heating.",35,,
289,0.97,1656.588,1663.161,I also urge you to extend fossil fuel restrictions for water heating to all commercial buildings.,35,,
290,0.97,1663.161,1689.287,"To not delay this code instead of an amendment you should pass a resolution today that commenced the committee to have some legislation in the next month to restrict possible fuel, water heating, in all commercial buildings at the same time.",35,,
291,0.97,1689.287,1692.424,We must as a committee act on the concrete proven measures to fight climate change now today.,35,,
292,0.97,1692.424,1704.135,I am reminded of when the chair of the committee Councilperson Dan Strauss came to our group and he was it committed to fighting climate change as a priority.,35,,
293,0.97,1704.135,1708.707,He thought the people did not realize will have to do business differently.,35,,
294,0.97,1708.707,1708.907,Yes.,35,,
295,0.97,1708.907,1709.407,We will.,35,,
296,0.97,1709.407,1713.111,We all have an opportunity to do this now.,35,,
297,0.97,1713.111,1714.212,Thank you.,35,,
298,0.97,1714.212,1716.948,"Thank you, Cynthia.",36,,
299,0.97,1716.948,1722.253,We have limited time to address this climate crisis . I still believe that today.,37,,
300,0.97,1722.253,1724.756,"Cynthia, I see you still.",37,,
301,0.97,1724.756,1734.866,Are you able to press Star six?,37,,
302,0.97,1734.866,1747.479,Can she make sure that the phone is not in sleep mode also?,38,,
303,0.97,1747.479,1748.313,"Cynthia, we will leave you up.",39,,

306,0.97,1761.659,1761.96,Good morning.,39,,
307,0.97,1761.96,1762.327,Thank you.,40,,
308,0.97,1762.327,1763.361,"To clarify, do have one minute or 30 seconds?",40,,
309,0.97,1763.361,1763.928,We are at one minute.,41,,
310,0.97,1763.928,1766.998,Thank you.,42,,
311,0.97,1766.998,1769.0,My name is deeper.,42,,
312,0.97,1769.0,1770.201,On the Washington policy manager at climate solutions.,42,,
313,0.97,1770.201,1782.881,We support the updates to the commercial energy code with a crucial amendment which would remove the unnecessary delay of the implementation of space heating provisions until next year.,42,,
314,0.97,1782.881,1791.156,These code updates are an important step forward in curbing Seattle's greenhouse gas emissions as well as protecting the health and safety of our residents and workers.,42,,
315,0.97,1791.156,1796.494,"As Dr. Dooley mentioned earlier, buildings in Washington emit balloons that can harm respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological health.",42,,
316,0.97,1796.494,1800.064,Air pollution happens both indoors and outdoors in buildings.,42,,
317,0.97,1800.064,1812.443,Air pollution just proportionally impacts low income community since the historical impacts of segregation and Redlining have led these committees to be pushed to limit greater exposure to air pollution.,42,,
318,0.97,1812.443,1814.746,And the current Covid-19 pandemic to further heighten these risks.,42,,
319,0.97,1814.746,1823.121,As small increases in the response is currently with a large increase in Covid-19 death rate.,42,,
320,0.97,1823.121,1841.739,For these reasons doing parts of the code would create greater risk to the health of Seattle workers and we also encourage counsel to look ahead pass this update to another ordinance that Electrifies all new buildings in Seattle while this code update is a great first step --,42,,
321,0.97,1841.739,1842.106,Thank you.,43,,
322,0.97,1842.106,1843.308,Please do feel free to send in your written comments.,43,,
323,0.97,1843.308,1851.883,Up next we have Chris Holmstrom followed by just Wallace and on deck is Benjamin Mart.,43,,
324,0.97,1851.883,1852.35,"Good morning, Chris.",43,,

328,0.97,1854.185,1863.561,I'm here on the Seattle chapter in support of adopting the 2018 energy code and both proposed a minutes from Council members.,44,,
329,0.97,1863.561,1864.596,I will keep it simple with two main points.,44,,
330,0.97,1864.596,1881.446,"First, we need energy code and continued improvement so Seattle can meet its climate target in an equitable way to address some of the city's largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions.",44,,
331,0.97,1881.446,1886.251,"Two, architects in the building industry the discontinued environmental leadership from the city to help bring up the baseline or building owners will voluntarily meet the energy and Decarbonization target that they should.",44,,
332,0.97,1886.251,1887.385,Raising for help solve us to live healthier lives.,44,,
333,0.97,1887.385,1890.822,There's two main topics I want to touch on briefly.,44,,
334,0.97,1890.822,1894.525,"First, the cost of inaction or delay in action is to great.",44,,
335,0.97,1894.525,1900.431,"If we keep pushing off building responsibly will cost us all more in the future, because building Retrofits are really more expensive.",44,,
336,0.97,1900.431,1905.403,The doctrine the first test 20 talked about health impacts as well.,44,,
337,0.97,1905.403,1909.24,"Secondly, clear legislative policy direction is key to reducing market cost.",44,,
338,0.97,1909.24,1912.043,Thanks for supporting me.,44,,
339,0.97,1912.043,1912.61,"Thank you, Chris.",45,,
340,0.97,1912.61,1919.05,"Next we have just Wallace followed by Benjamin Merritt and Britney Busch delay, you are on deck.",45,,
341,0.97,1919.05,1928.393,"Cynthia, if you are able to press Star six and once we see you are off mute we will bring you back into the Queue.",45,,
342,0.97,1928.393,1929.36,"Good morning, just.",45,,
343,0.97,1929.36,1930.461,Good morning.,46,,
344,0.97,1930.461,1934.365,My name is just Wallace.,46,,
345,0.97,1934.365,1938.636,I'm one of the campaign Codirectors with 350 Seattle.,46,,
346,0.97,1938.636,1942.24,For more than half my life Seattle's mayors have been promising bold action on climate.,46,,

576,0.97,3060.857,3061.458,I will reiterate a few here.,88,,
577,0.97,3061.458,3065.195,There are some standards that codify constructions with cross laminated timber.,88,,
578,0.97,3065.195,3074.171,There is codification standards for Gender-Neutral toilets there is new standards.,88,,

580,0.97,3091.521,3092.823,And then there are some new standards for tiny houses.,88,,
581,0.97,3092.823,3099.529,"My read on this, Michael and O'Dell can correct me if I'm wrong, this pertains what we would call [Indiscernible] not necessarily tiny health villages in a Land-Use context.",88,,
582,0.97,3099.529,3108.105,"Finally, new requirements for fire Sprinklers for Townhouse Department below a certain size threshold.",88,,
583,0.97,3108.105,3118.949,I guess I will ask Ardell and Micah to Chine in here with the discussion of that standard.,88,,
584,0.97,3118.949,3126.022,Thank you.,89,,
585,0.97,3126.022,3127.958,"So, the change for Townhouse Sprinklers was also discussed at the state level.",89,,
586,0.97,3127.958,3136.433,Seattle further amended to require Townhouse Sprinklers in all Townhome construction.,89,,
587,0.97,3136.433,3139.903,"Again, a reminder that Townhomes are three units or more that are connected.",89,,
588,0.97,3139.903,3146.476,"So, the difference between Seattle and the state is three and four unit Townhomes.",89,,
589,0.97,3146.476,3157.654,"Seattle will be sprinkle . I can, sprinkler--really the discussion was we all except that Sprinklers protect for hazards between buildings.",89,,
590,0.97,3157.654,3163.293,"And the question is, what is acceptable risk for fire spreading to adjacent units?",89,,
591,0.97,3163.293,3170.767,The builders are correct.,89,,
592,0.97,3170.767,3171.168,Absolutely right.,89,,
593,0.97,3171.168,3178.975,There is added cost in adding Sprinklers to Townhome units and that does get transferred to the residence and the cost of housing in the city.,89,,
594,0.97,3178.975,3184.514,"There is the cost of the Sprinklers, cost of connection to the water main.",89,,
595,0.97,3184.514,3185.081,Those are the big ones.,89,,
596,0.97,3185.081,3186.182,My question is how do you cover that cost?,89,,
597,0.97,3186.182,3197.994,"We did have discussion about reductions in rate of construction, reducing, helping to counter that cost as well as reduced insurance costs.",89,,
598,0.97,3197.994,3202.933,"Michael, do you want to add anything?",89,,
599,0.97,3202.933,3203.366,Certainly.,90,,
600,0.97,3203.366,3204.201,I think you covered most of that.,90,,
601,0.97,3204.201,3229.826,"We did have multiple meetings on this topic . We had both for and against . When it came up for vote at the construction code advisory board it was a unanimous vote to move forward with, with their language, which would be to require them in all Townhomes one of the other things that we had a question, previously was how is this shown in the code?",90,,
602,0.97,3229.826,3244.174,"We wanted to just make sure that is identified by the language . We did not, technically, adopt the exception from the state.",90,,
603,0.97,3244.174,3252.015,"That would be the only change that you would see in the code, is that there is not an additional exception that we are adopting.",90,,
604,0.97,3252.015,3257.721,"I can, the state is adopting Sprinklers and units that have five or more townhouses.",90,,
605,0.97,3257.721,3262.993,If you have any other questions please let me know.,90,,

621,0.97,3346.676,3364.527,Especially as we think about using the Airspace that is unused in many parts of our city . We have some good test pilots that are happening right now related to housing and affordable housing and using that type of frame.,92,,

631,0.97,3399.863,3408.204,That is a template for all new legislation . It asks whether the legislation is going to increase or decrease carbon emissions.,94,,
632,0.97,3408.204,3421.351,It asks whether legislation is going to help the city become more resilient in the face of climate change we are already in the midst of.,94,,

688,0.97,3789.919,3802.899,"To achieve these goals, these two goals the proposed goal would restrict the use of fossil fuels and electric resistance systems for space eating for all commercial and multifamily buildings.",111,,
689,0.97,3802.899,3806.936,Also restrict the use of fossil fuels for water heating and multifamily and hotel uses.,111,,
690,0.97,3806.936,3815.511,The water heating restrictions would only apply to these types of uses based on the rationale that they have more predictable water demand and commercial uses.,111,,
691,0.97,3815.511,3820.616,Which vary widely depending on the business.,111,,
692,0.97,3820.616,3831.06,These are new restrictions these two provisions are propose to have an effective date of January 1ST 2022 rather than March 15th 2021.,111,,
693,0.97,3831.06,3837.266,When the rest of the code would go into effect.,111,,
694,0.97,3837.266,3855.651,"Sdci staff noted that the effective date delay for space eating was proposed in order to allow for additional outreach, but that product necessary to achieve a Compliant is already available . in the case of water heating your time is necessary for both outreach and to allow for the necessary technology to reach the market.",111,,
695,0.97,3855.651,3877.94,"I would also note that the environmental analysis conducted as per Sepa, the state environment policy act, states that these measures will reduce carbon emissions by 4.4% by 2050. and that this new code update, carbon emissions, would be evaluated as part of the building energy model.",111,,
696,0.97,3877.94,3880.276,Not just energy use.,111,,
697,0.97,3880.276,3895.591,"Other measures in the proposed 2018 Seattle energy code would improve insulation, enhance the building envelope, and increase production of renewable energy.",111,,

699,0.97,3896.125,3897.727,"Duane, Micah, Adele, anything to add?",112,,

701,0.97,3898.794,3903.499,I think we are good.,113,,
702,0.97,3903.499,3906.369,Wonderful.,114,,
703,0.97,3906.369,3908.704,Not seeing further comments.,114,,
704,0.97,3908.704,3913.042,"Yolanda, I believe we have a number of amendments.",114,,
705,0.97,3913.042,3913.409,Yes.,115,,
706,0.97,3913.409,3913.809,That is correct.,115,,
707,0.97,3913.809,3916.445,There are two amendments.,115,,
708,0.97,3916.445,3930.159,I will give an overview . This would change the effective date delay for the restrictions on the use of fossil fuels and electric resistance for space heating.,115,,
709,0.97,3930.159,3946.709,"This amendment would make--sorry, I should also note that the version 1 of the amendment, which was attached to the memo has now been superseded by version 2 of the amendment, which I sent out right as the committee commenced this morning.",115,,
710,0.97,3946.709,3968.397,"Version 2--version 1 proposed to remove the January 1ST 2022 effective date delay entirely, which would make the restrictions for space heating go into effect on March 15th of 2021 with the rest of the energy code.",115,,
711,0.97,3968.397,3976.806,Version 2 instead proposes that these restrictions should go into effect on June 1ST 2021.,115,,
712,0.97,3976.806,3983.646,So that the version 2 is what I believe the sponsored would like considered by the committee.,115,,
713,0.97,3983.646,3984.013,Thank you.,116,,
714,0.97,3984.013,3990.186,Do you have a screen that you can share for us to visually see the amendments?,116,,
715,0.97,3990.186,3999.128,"And vice chair Mosqueda, do you have any thoughts you'd like to share on this?",116,,
716,0.97,3999.128,3999.695,Thank you very much.,117,,
717,0.97,3999.695,4005.634,"Thank you Mr. chair, again for your work to have these robust discussions and build in enough time for us to consider possible changes.",117,,
718,0.97,4005.634,4011.874,I think as well to the executive for the robust and clear engagement they have done on this issue.,117,,
719,0.97,4011.874,4019.415,"Mr. chair, if it pleases you we will describe the amendment again and then move it, if that sounds reasonable.",117,,
720,0.97,4019.415,4022.451,Or would you like me to move it first?,117,,
721,0.97,4022.451,4023.486,A brief discussion would be great.,118,,
722,0.97,4023.486,4026.055,And then we will get into moving the item after that.,118,,
723,0.97,4026.055,4027.957,Thanks very much.,119,,
724,0.97,4027.957,4049.245,"The amendment in front of you, version 2 of amendment one, helps to move the effective dates of the imitation of heat pumps to June 1ST, 2021 instead of January 21st 2022.",119,,
725,0.97,4049.245,4054.183,This was an implementation date specifically for the restrictions related to the use of electric resistance or fossil fuels for space heating.,119,,
726,0.97,4054.183,4065.227,"This amendment would make the restrictions going to affect on the effective date of June 1ST, which would give us the opportunity to have more robust engagement.",119,,
727,0.97,4065.227,4098.194,"Having conversations over the last few days, especially with some of our folks from building construction trades, also you a 32 laborers and a handful of our folks that you heard from this morning as well, from the environmental justice world and housing world, including AIA, Northwest energy, 350 Seattle, Emerald city, and a few others we wanted to make sure that there was the ability to make the change to using space heating available earlier than originally proposed in the legislation in front of us.",119,,
728,0.97,4098.194,4106.202,"Also, to make sure there is a robust engagement for Rulemaking.",119,,
729,0.97,4106.202,4124.019,Also understand there are some pieces of legislation moving their way through the halls of Olympia . out of respect for that process recognizing that there is conversation specifically dealing with Refrigerant pipes and how those Refrigerant pipes could be used in heat pumps for space heating.,119,,
730,0.97,4124.019,4127.456,We want to make sure that we have all the available information in front of us as we finalize rules.,119,,
731,0.97,4127.456,4142.037,"The desire here is to make sure that the imitation date is June 1ST 2021, so we can move forward with urgency, but also in a way that makes sure the Rulemaking is reflective of any changes that may occur in the state legislative session and also gives us time to have engagement with stake holders here.",119,,
732,0.97,4142.037,4160.656,"Colleagues, we know from our own city Footprints that we currently see everyday that these are: marks we see across our city specifically as well as in Pioneer square those buildings we create and that we don't have the ability to last for decades, if not generations.",119,,
733,0.97,4160.656,4165.494,I'm really excited that we are working on passing the energy foot today.,119,,
734,0.97,4165.494,4169.365,"We also aim to improve the construction of both businesses and homes to make sure that we are moving towards a greener, healthier future.",119,,
735,0.97,4169.365,4171.767,Greener and healthier future for the next generation.,119,,
736,0.97,4171.767,4208.203,"I think the codes in front of us make some critical changes . In addition to this in the mid today with this change date to June we also are working collectively with various Stakeholders to help make sure that the buildings are moving towards more energy efficiency, that we move towards a just transition as we think about new technologies at hand and that we are Gritting sustainable policies as well as working in partnership with trade unions and other architect, engineer, and architect organizations we heard from over the last few meetings.",119,,
737,0.97,4208.203,4213.976,I really appreciate your consideration of this amendment before us.,119,,
738,0.97,4213.976,4229.425,"I to get echoes much of what we heard this morning during public testimony, looking for that right balance as we shift away and move towards clean renewable energy and making sure we are doing it through just transition strategies and when the technology is available, like it is here, that we do it with a sense of urgency.",119,,
739,0.97,4229.425,4230.259,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",119,,
740,0.97,4230.259,4244.273,Thank you . Thank you for both bringing the amendment forward and then incorporating Stakeholder feedback to be able to make this fit as quickly as possible but I really appreciate that.,120,,
741,0.97,4244.273,4246.675,"Colleagues, do we have any comments?",120,,
742,0.97,4246.675,4247.209,Councilmember Peterson.,120,,
743,0.97,4247.209,4250.179,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",121,,
744,0.97,4250.179,4255.751,Thank you Councilmember for explaining the cement so thoroughly and the thought process behind it.,121,,
745,0.97,4255.751,4268.631,"We have some questions for staff . As I understand, the construction advisory board recommended the January one 2022 date.",121,,
746,0.97,4268.631,4286.715,"There was an official process that various Stakeholders already went through to come up with that date, January 1 2022, which then the executive were accepted in submitted to us for our consideration.",121,,
747,0.97,4286.715,4305.567,"Is there--the fiscal NOTE in dealing with the climate change question, it says that emissions will go down, resiliency will go up if this is enacted with January 120 20 to date.",121,,
748,0.97,4305.567,4312.541,"We obviously heard a lot of passionate comments from groups who would like to have this happen sooner, which makes sense as well.",121,,
749,0.97,4312.541,4325.421,"Then we also heard from certain labor organizations, those who build the housing who would prefer the January 120 20 to date.",121,,
750,0.97,4325.421,4342.171,"I am sort of struggling with this a bit in terms of the implementation date either way counsel is going to pass something that improves the code and makes it, you know, addresses climate change.",121,,
751,0.97,4342.171,4343.672,The effective date is the key issue here.,121,,
752,0.97,4343.672,4359.655,For staff is there anything preventing those building new buildings from using these changes voluntarily?,121,,
753,0.97,4359.655,4371.266,I guess we could start with Yolanda or Micah.,121,,
754,0.97,4372.267,4373.902,Great question on asking if they are allowed to use those currently.,122,,
755,0.97,4373.902,4374.103,Yes.,122,,
756,0.97,4374.103,4380.976,If an applicant chooses to implement this themselves with their application under the 2018 codes we would accept that as part of the package.,122,,
757,0.97,4380.976,4394.857,"There would be an additional step where they would need to provide much a cold alternate request, which is just another minor step to allow that.",122,,
758,0.97,4394.857,4397.226,"My understanding is, yes, we would allow that to occur if they wanted to implement this on their own.",122,,
759,0.97,4397.226,4399.928,An earlier date than what is stated here.,122,,
760,0.97,4399.928,4400.529,Okay.,123,,
761,0.97,4400.529,4406.301,I would just add that everyone is always free to go better than code.,123,,
762,0.97,4406.301,4411.306,Right.,124,,
763,0.97,4411.306,4411.607,Okay.,125,,
764,0.97,4411.607,4411.907,Okay.,126,,

766,0.97,4412.341,4412.641,Thank you.,126,,
767,0.97,4412.641,4422.05,"That is my only question now, chair Strauss maybe other Councilmembers might generate more questions.",126,,
768,0.97,4422.05,4423.852,Thank you Council member Peterson.,127,,
769,0.97,4423.852,4429.258,Are there comments?,127,,
770,0.97,4429.258,4429.825,Thank you Mr. chair.,128,,
771,0.97,4429.825,4434.73,I just wanted to take a moment here to speak up in favor of the amendment.,128,,
772,0.97,4434.73,4440.936,I had also been considering not moving a variation of this amendment and conversations with Stakeholders.,128,,
773,0.97,4440.936,4470.199,"I'm happy to stand aside for the process that Councilmember Mosqueda convened I appreciate that the deadline that Councilmember Mosqueda ultimately agreed on is one that is cognizant of other moving pieces in Olympia . and feedback from Stakeholders in labor and in industry . You know, I appreciate the exchange Council member Peterson just had with central staff.",128,,
774,0.97,4470.199,4492.554,"I think our response in our building permit to the climate emergency has to go beyond expectations of people doing more than what is expected . and voluntary, essentially, use of some of these different materials, some of these standards and observing some of these energy policies.",128,,
775,0.97,4492.554,4518.413,"I know we have a great many builders, especially in district 7 who have gone above and beyond . and there has been a lot of innovation, for example, of people taking advantage of the green building pilot, which has been the case of Incentivized use of a lot of these energy standards that we are discussing and Codifying now.",128,,
776,0.97,4518.413,4519.281,Do we need a more extreme degree?,128,,
777,0.97,4519.281,4520.549,We need to take this next step.,128,,
778,0.97,4520.549,4525.32,We need to do it with urgency and on an accelerated Timeline.,128,,
779,0.97,4525.32,4539.601,I think this amendment Councilmember Mosqueda has put together is a good balance of talking to all the Stakeholders to have a reasonable Timeline that Bounces those interests.,128,,
780,0.97,4539.601,4540.802,I will be voting in favor of this amendment today.,128,,
781,0.97,4540.802,4543.171,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,129,,
782,0.97,4543.171,4549.378,Councilmember wars any comments at this time?,129,,
783,0.97,4549.378,4550.979,I actually do.,130,,
784,0.97,4550.979,4562.524,"I'm just a little, I know that you want to change it from January 2022 to June 2021.",130,,
785,0.97,4562.524,4566.261,Correct?,130,,
786,0.97,4566.261,4586.982,I know that you're talking about this accelerated Timeline . I understand the concerns . I also understand from looking at what the construction advisory board said . I apologize I have not read the whole 12 page memo from Yolanda.,130,,
787,0.97,4586.982,4591.687,Thank you.,130,,
788,0.97,4591.687,4604.9,"I guess from listening to public comment and some of the Pipefitters and some folks and some of the calls we got that asked us to reject this amendment what is the actual, if I'm wrong I'm wrong and that's fine, the expediency of right now?",130,,
789,0.97,4604.9,4612.074,Why now right now in light of what we are dealing with and what we are looking at on the Stateside?,130,,
790,0.97,4612.074,4629.825,"Is there any kind of common sense approach to the reason why we want to move it up is because this will happen or is it just because, you know, climate change and we need to do everything now?",130,,
791,0.97,4629.825,4630.726,I'm just asking the practical question.,130,,
792,0.97,4630.726,4636.365,"Vice chairman Skater and then doing, I see you are also off of mute.",131,,
793,0.97,4636.365,4645.04,I'm happy to wait until after central staff or the Department staff respond.,132,,
794,0.97,4645.04,4645.574,Not a problem.,133,,
795,0.97,4645.574,4645.807,Doing?,133,,
796,0.97,4645.807,4664.092,"It's quite unusual that we put a delay of limitation date on anything . We did originally with the water heating, because that's an unusual type of construction for most contractors and engineers.",134,,
797,0.97,4664.092,4666.895,There was some learning curve.,134,,
798,0.97,4666.895,4685.08,"The original build did not have a delay for the space heating, because that is conventional construction that is widely used all over . This did come up as kind of a Compromie with several other issues in the midst of the discussions.",134,,
799,0.97,4685.08,4691.42,It is what the Mayor put forward.,134,,
800,0.97,4691.42,4692.02,It was the one year delay.,134,,
801,0.97,4692.02,4700.929,There wasn't a specific technical need for that.,134,,
802,0.97,4700.929,4701.229,Okay.,135,,
803,0.97,4701.229,4702.864,"It wasn't actually a date set and then we said Okay, let's have a delay.",135,,
804,0.97,4702.864,4711.74,And then we picked January 2022.,135,,
805,0.97,4711.74,4712.774,If it's political and policy that's fine.,135,,
806,0.97,4712.774,4714.876,"I don't have a problem with people having an agenda, I just need to know what it is.",135,,
807,0.97,4714.876,4722.451,"Not dressing up in some practical, like, you know, climate change is going to hit us in a week and we got to do it now.",135,,
808,0.97,4722.451,4723.018,That's just all I'm asking.,135,,
809,0.97,4723.018,4723.719,I'm not trying to be cute here.,135,,
810,0.97,4723.719,4736.765,"I'm just trying to figure out why we are spending so much time on moving something up when it is basically, if it's a policy piece and there is an emergent issue of climate change and we need to do this now I get that.",135,,
811,0.97,4736.765,4741.069,I would rather hear that.,135,,
812,0.97,4741.069,4741.636,I will leave it at that.,135,,
813,0.97,4741.636,4741.937,Thank you.,135,,
814,0.97,4741.937,4750.979,"Council member warriors, I will say in the last Committee hearing there was conversation of bringing both the heat pump and the water heating forward.",136,,
815,0.97,4750.979,4768.43,"We requested to, because the technology is not right today, that water heating would be delayed . There is a policy reason there.",136,,
816,0.97,4768.43,4769.664,Because we just don't have that technology there today.,136,,
817,0.97,4769.664,4771.566,"As far as heat pumps, it's my understanding that we do have the technology here today.",136,,
818,0.97,4771.566,4785.313,That technology is ready to implement . and that's--so we decided when to bring this into implementation as we heard earlier today.,136,,
819,0.97,4785.313,4786.882,Councilmember Mosqueda brought the amendment up for March.,136,,
820,0.97,4786.882,4791.119,That would be next month.,136,,
821,0.97,4791.119,4795.59,"And then to provide some more buffer zone for people to have this, have time to ramp up.",136,,
822,0.97,4795.59,4800.829,That's why that date has been chosen.,136,,
823,0.97,4800.829,4801.83,It's my understanding at this time.,136,,
824,0.97,4801.83,4802.13,Okay.,137,,

829,0.97,4815.177,4819.147,Is that more Inspector gadget?,138,,
830,0.97,4819.147,4819.581,Close enough.,139,,

839,0.97,4832.36,4847.108,I think it's a combination of we have the technology and I think that it's also reasonable for us to ask for a June 1ST implementation date to make sure we are also reflecting any of the possible changes that might be underway related to Refrigerant pipes that are used in the heat pump technology.,141,,
840,0.97,4847.108,4855.817,"Appreciate you a 32, the feedback I have received from them specifically.",141,,
841,0.97,4855.817,4866.561,The ongoing Conversaions they're having with legislators in Olympia about how to mitigate the impact of greenhouse gases that are used in Refrigerants . and the Hydrofluorocarbons that they still are trying to address.,141,,
842,0.97,4866.561,4871.199,If there's any possible changes coming from the state legislator discussions we also want to be reflective of that.,141,,
843,0.97,4871.199,4875.704,"It's really about a practical date for implementation, recognizing technology is in front of us.",141,,
844,0.97,4875.704,4883.979,Also building in enough time to incorporate any potential changes from the state Legislature.,141,,
845,0.97,4883.979,4892.32,"Frankly, to also give us the time for sufficient Stakeholder engagement on Rulemaking.",141,,
846,0.97,4892.32,4893.388,I was originally supportive of the March date.,141,,
847,0.97,4893.388,4929.858,"I think as we think about Rulemaking and wanted to make sure there is the opportunity for us to also build into Rulemaking the need to be working with licensed Tradespeople, especially in the area of plumbers and Pipefitters and making sure there's appropriate folks, Asher, from President Geyer, who have the responsibility of making sure this technology is being applied directly to technology available today, but we are having the right skill Tradespeople and Lamenting it but we also have a chance to work on Rulemaking to make sure does licenses are being displayed any time we are and Lamenting these new technologies.",141,,
848,0.97,4929.858,4940.235,With the broader traits making sure that jurisdictional rules and responsibility are currently laid out . moving from March to June made a lot of sense to me.,141,,
849,0.97,4940.235,4946.508,Most for the limitation and feedback from any State legislation bills that pass.,141,,
850,0.97,4946.508,4950.178,The technology is here.,141,,
851,0.97,4950.178,4959.888,I think it is with urgency to move forward and also in a way to take in that Stakeholder engagement.,141,,
852,0.97,4959.888,4962.257,"Also members of the building trades, specifically you a 32 for feedback within the last 24 hours.",141,,
853,0.97,4962.257,4966.995,And also all the work that folks have been doing to make sure that we don't have another years worth of delay here.,141,,
854,0.97,4966.995,4969.531,I think that strikes a great balance.,141,,
855,0.97,4969.531,4979.708,With that I would like to move amendment one version 2 to counsel bill 11 9993.,141,,
856,0.97,4979.708,4980.208,Thank you.,142,,

863,0.97,5018.646,5025.653,The motion carries.,146,,
864,0.97,5025.653,5033.561,"The second amendment, my understanding is that the Lewis amendment would require us to delay and limitation of the legislation for an additional environment to review.",146,,
865,0.97,5033.561,5042.37,Councilmember Lewis has agreed Úto pull this amendment and consider separate legislation.,146,,
866,0.97,5042.37,5042.804,Is that correct?,146,,
867,0.97,5042.804,5043.037,Yes.,147,,
868,0.97,5043.037,5043.538,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",147,,
869,0.97,5043.538,5044.839,I want to address that for a moment.,147,,
870,0.97,5044.839,5054.282,Sort of related to our previous discussion about accelerating the limitation in a lot of these critical code updates.,147,,
871,0.97,5054.282,5084.312,"In consultation with central staff and the executive level offices we learned that it will perhaps require, I want to turn it over to you want in a second to talk about some of this from the central staff point of view as well, that there would be additional Cipro work required to extend some of these requirements to all commercial buildings that would necessitate delay of the underlying legislation for at least an additional month and possibly longer.",147,,
872,0.97,5084.312,5121.015,In the interest of allowing us to pass these critical changes on the expected Timeline my plan is to withdraw my amendment and to seek additional legislation on its own Timeline to pursue putting these the same code changes toward broader applicability of commercial buildings . and in so doing make sure that process is not like an anchor pulling everything down in terms of the time.,147,,
873,0.97,5121.015,5137.098,"I guess what I would say is I'm not interested, necessarily, in exploring I'm committing right here that I will be introducing additional legislation, since I know there is a lot of Stakeholders and folks who are watching and really supportive of this amendment.",147,,
874,0.97,5137.098,5144.739,"I just want to reassure everybody that the goal here is to pass, pass this as a separate bill.",147,,
875,0.97,5144.739,5164.092,"So that we don't delay the implementation of these other critical changes . and that I intend to do that through Council member Strauss's committee here, not over the next couple of months as we go through and additive from Ciba process.",147,,
876,0.97,5164.092,5173.601,"I will let Elana jump into explain some of the technical, more technical side of that.",147,,
877,0.97,5173.601,5174.135,That is my thinking.,147,,
878,0.97,5174.135,5174.702,Thank you.,148,,

882,0.97,5177.906,5178.139,Yes.,149,,
883,0.97,5178.139,5219.347,"Because the extension of the restriction of these fossil fuels for water heating to commercial buildings was not a part of the initial environmental review, which accompanied this legislation, it will require an Addendum, which will have to include this additional provision . As discussed previously, building code changes are highly technical, very, you know, really, you know, they get really into the weeds on building design and technology and electricity and lots of really complicated factors.",149,,
884,0.97,5219.347,5241.869,Having Sdci staff engage in this process and due to the extensive amount of outreach they conducted on these amendments that is also a factor to consider as the Council considers potential future amendments to the energy code there.,149,,
885,0.97,5241.869,5252.38,"It's a complicated, intensive process for staff are just making sure that everyone understands the applications moving forward.",149,,
886,0.97,5252.38,5252.88,They will be important.,149,,
887,0.97,5252.88,5253.147,Yes.,149,,
888,0.97,5253.147,5279.607,"In terms of the additional analysis, you know, as many of you are familiar with, along with Ciba, there is following the threshold determination by the analysis of significant, there'll be a comment period, an appeal period, and then the Council will then be free to act on the legislation.",149,,
889,0.97,5279.607,5282.977,That is kind of the standard process.,149,,
890,0.97,5282.977,5291.319,That is where the minimum of a month is just to do that aspect of the work that is coming into play.,149,,
891,0.97,5291.319,5292.22,Thank you.,150,,
892,0.97,5292.22,5307.035,"This was what I had Referenced during public comment, that to ensure that we are engaging the correct Stakeholders, because this is, again, a change . We don't have the technology ready to implement today.",150,,
893,0.97,5307.035,5324.152,That we need to have a further discussion about . are there any discussions from colleagues about this process or about Council member Louis's comments?,150,,

910,0.97,5390.985,5406.234,And then I see vice chairman mosquito have a comment afterwards.,155,,
911,0.97,5406.234,5406.834,I will defer to in L.A.,156,,
912,0.97,5406.834,5408.236,I believe with the divided report there is a One-Week delay.,156,,
913,0.97,5408.236,5409.904,I don't know if it abstention counts as a divided report.,156,,
914,0.97,5409.904,5414.542,It does not.,157,,
915,0.97,5414.542,5415.143,That is correct.,158,,
916,0.97,5415.143,5422.049,And Ascension does not effect the legislation being immediately forwarded to the next city council meeting.,158,,

918,0.97,5427.855,5431.692,I did not get a chance to say this during discussion.,160,,
919,0.97,5431.692,5443.538,I have a question while we have some of our friends from the team who worked on drafting the legislation is on the line still.,160,,
920,0.97,5443.538,5474.969,"I know there has been a lot of conversations, Mr. chair, that you have been involved in and this is a big priority for you as well as we think about just transition . As we think about the advance in new heights around our city that are causing potential harm to our residents . for example, what happened in Greenwood a few years ago . can you talk a little bit more about any strategies from the Timeline for addressing those abandoned pipes and how we can help make sure that the licensed trade folks who should be doing that type of work to Decommission those are being put to work?",160,,
921,0.97,5474.969,5482.743,"Anyway we can help ensure that both is being done safely, that would be helpful to know.",160,,

923,0.97,5483.11,5495.089,This was a conversation that during--as his bill came before our committee I was looking at other issues regarding natural gas lines.,161,,
924,0.97,5495.089,5513.641,"We know that 50% of fires during seismic events are due to natural gas lines . As you mentioned, council member Mosqueda, the Greenwood explosion was from a Decommissioned line that we thought was not active.",161,,
925,0.97,5513.641,5538.733,It was in fact active . I have asked the questions on how we can ensure that licensed trades are able to ensure that natural gas lines that we believe are Decommissioned are truly Decommissioned . When I did the research into this it became clearly apparent that this is not an energy code.,161,,
926,0.97,5538.733,5539.734,It is in fact a fire code.,161,,
927,0.97,5539.734,5563.19,"I will be following up with our public safety chair to ensure that we are able to bring the appropriate amendments, so that Decommissioned the lines are truly Decommissioned and that work is completed by the correct licensed practitioners.",161,,
