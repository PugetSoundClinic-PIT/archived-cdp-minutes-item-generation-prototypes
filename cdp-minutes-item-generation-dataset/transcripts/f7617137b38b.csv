24,0.97,99.699,102.669,We're going to start with the presentation.,3,,

26,0.97,107.006,111.611,"Colleagues, I will be making a motion to hold this item, in conversation with the office of housing.",3,,
27,0.97,111.611,113.012,Just a few additional Tweaks are needed.,3,,

35,0.97,141.274,148.081,"I want to thank the departments as well, who have been providing monthly report to the city budget's office.",3,,
36,0.97,148.081,150.517,And we as a city council have been receiving those.,3,,
37,0.97,150.517,158.224,"However, we like to have quarterly updates on the implementation of how those American plan rescue dollars are going.",3,,
38,0.97,158.224,163.296,All of was this our Seattle rescue plan passed in July of 2021.,3,,
39,0.97,163.296,167.167,And then embedded into our 2022 budget that we passed in November of 2021.,3,,
40,0.97,167.167,174.073,So getting an update on a regular basis on those implementation efforts is going to be critical.,3,,
41,0.97,174.073,178.344,And we appreciate that they had delayed their presentation to today at our request as well.,3,,
42,0.97,178.344,184.584,"And finally, we will wrap up with the grand finale, which is part 2 of our conversation.",3,,
43,0.97,184.584,185.818,Looking at the budget forecast this.,3,,

50,0.97,213.68,221.988,"But this is somewhat historic and hopefully groundbreaking, a new pattern of transparency and accessibility for our budgeting.",3,,
51,0.97,221.988,230.964,"For members of the public and for city Councilmembers, as we now have the opportunity to look at the six-year forecast well in advance of any budget deliberations.",3,,
52,0.97,230.964,239.005,"This is something that I have been looking forward to having for the last two years, after learning that it was not readily available in advance of our budget making.",3,,
53,0.97,239.005,241.174,So looking forward to that.,3,,
54,0.97,241.174,241.608,"Again, colleagues.",3,,

56,0.97,244.344,252.518,"However, I do want to go ahead and get the agenda in front of us, so I can make the motion to remove agenda item number 1, if that's okay.",3,,
57,0.97,252.518,254.988,"Colleagues, I move to adopt the agenda.",3,,
58,0.97,254.988,255.421,Is there a second?,3,,

61,0.97,257.323,258.625,It's been moved and Seconded.,5,,
62,0.97,258.625,261.427,I do have the one amendment I mentioned.,5,,

70,0.97,291.591,292.291,Let's go into public comment.,5,,
71,0.97,292.291,300.833,We do make an effort to make sure that there is public comment available at the beginning of each of our committee meetings.,5,,
72,0.97,300.833,306.706,We've done this through these select budget committee and also through the Finance and housing committee meeting.,5,,
73,0.97,306.706,314.48,"Every committee meeting, you can sign up before our committee meeting and you can also sign up during and when the presentation is happening.",5,,
74,0.97,314.48,320.453,"I just want to explain to folks if you didn't get to dial in today, you can always E-mail us.",5,,
75,0.97,320.453,323.99,"At this time, I am not seeing anybody signed up for public comment.",5,,
76,0.97,323.99,327.093,And we appreciate all the folks who called in on a regular basis.,5,,
77,0.97,327.093,341.374,"But again, if you're watching and wanted to provide public comment, you are welcome to do so at Council @ Seattlecouncil.Gov.",5,,

84,0.97,373.005,377.51,I'm excited we have Julie Dingley.,9,,
85,0.97,377.51,378.511,Along with your team.,9,,
86,0.97,378.511,381.18,"From your team, we have William Chen.",9,,

88,0.97,396.262,399.832,"And again, interim director Allie Panuchi.",9,,
89,0.97,399.832,404.904,Thanks for your flexibility and being able to join us today instead of at our last committee meeting.,9,,
90,0.97,404.904,413.413,I am very excited that we have the opportunity to walk through the Seattle rescue plan act funds with you today.,9,,
91,0.97,413.413,433.432,"And Julie in your previous role as a deputy before being director at the budget office, it was a pleasure to work with you on the Seattle rescue presentation and to have worked with you as well, as we develop the 2022 budget, which includes Seattle rescue plan.",9,,
92,0.97,433.432,437.47,Very thankful for the monthly updates that we receive.,9,,
93,0.97,437.47,443.676,"And in those updates, we have been able to track progress, not only what funds have been allocated by the Council and the Mayor.",9,,
94,0.97,443.676,446.012,But then how the spending is going.,9,,
95,0.97,446.012,450.616,Probably more important area for folks who are impacted by the effects of Covid.,9,,
96,0.97,450.616,458.424,"And we have been able to see in those monthly reports, funding that has gone out the door and money that is also encumbered.",9,,
97,0.97,458.424,470.636,"I will note that since you have been the director and under the new administration, with the Mayor Harrell, we've seen more of those dollars go out the door.",9,,
98,0.97,470.636,471.971,"And more become encumbered, which is exciting.",9,,
99,0.97,471.971,477.41,"And I think we will take the rest of today to hear an update for you, for first quarter 2022.",9,,
100,0.97,477.41,484.483,"And also get a chance to ask some questions about where things may stand, if they're currently encumbered and not yet spent.",9,,
101,0.97,484.483,488.321,Or if all the funds are not yet encumbered yet.,9,,
102,0.97,488.321,491.157,Because we know the need is incredibly great out there.,9,,
103,0.97,491.157,497.396,"Just as a reminder, these investments are critical to our community Memberswho have tremendous need.",9,,
104,0.97,497.396,502.802,"Not just because of the pandemic, but because of needs that have been compounded.",9,,
105,0.97,502.802,526.225,"Especially thinking about folks of color, members of the Lgbtq community, small businesses, workers who were in many ways, suffering due to the economic inequalities that we saw in our community, and disparate access.",9,,
106,0.97,526.225,527.627,And has disproportionately affected those of color.,9,,
107,0.97,527.627,529.161,I'll let you dig into the details.,9,,
108,0.97,529.161,534.834,And I want to thank you for being here to help us walk through how it's going with getting these dollars out.,9,,
109,0.97,534.834,540.206,"And again, a huge note of appreciation for our Conressional partners who made the American rescue plan act possible.",9,,
110,0.97,540.206,544.243,And we will continue to call for more through build back better.,9,,
111,0.97,544.243,549.048,"With more, I'll turn it over.",9,,
112,0.97,549.048,559.191,Thank you for the warm introduction and for the gratitude for all that we've had in the Seattle rescue plan investments.,10,,
113,0.97,559.191,562.094,This show is now being run by William chin.,10,,
114,0.97,562.094,564.497,So I am here just to introduce him.,10,,
115,0.97,564.497,577.91,"And I appreciate his incredible hard work in leading the Federal funds teen within the budget office that is really coordinating city wide to make sure we're staying on top of these investments, doing our performance reporting.",10,,
116,0.97,577.91,584.55,Really just incredible work to William and team and excited to be here as he presents the latest work to you.,10,,
117,0.97,584.55,585.318,Wonderful.,11,,
118,0.97,585.318,586.218,Thanks so much.,11,,
119,0.97,586.218,586.719,"And welcome, William.",11,,
120,0.97,586.719,594.927,Thanks again to you for all the work you're doing.,11,,
121,0.97,594.927,597.763,We can do that.,11,,
122,0.97,597.763,598.798,Yes.,12,,
123,0.97,598.798,600.199,Wonderful.,13,,
124,0.97,600.199,603.703,Thanks so much.,13,,
125,0.97,603.703,608.307,Is that showing up for you?,14,,
126,0.97,608.307,608.874,That looks great.,15,,
127,0.97,608.874,612.645,Thank you.,15,,
128,0.97,612.645,626.726,"Good morning, chairman Mosqueda, Councilmembers, and thanks for an opportunity to give an update on these Government-Related funds and in particular the Arbit funds which we approved in the Seattle rescue plan.",15,,
129,0.97,626.726,634.066,"Ask also, giving an update on where FEMA reimbursements are in the pipeline.",15,,
130,0.97,634.066,640.006,"So briefly, with this presentation, we are continuing to make progress on building necessary capacity.",15,,
131,0.97,640.006,642.908,Contracting providers and spending the funds.,15,,
132,0.97,642.908,650.75,"But also want to share at the same time, we've also kicked off a new phase of Seattle rescue and presentation.",15,,
133,0.97,650.75,651.851,That is performance evaluation.,15,,
134,0.97,651.851,660.593,"With this, not only are we fulfilling the U.S. Treasury expectation.",15,,
135,0.97,660.593,663.996,But also advancing our own interest in understanding what we do to do better.,15,,
136,0.97,663.996,669.502,And we can share that with the city and the possible.,15,,
137,0.97,669.502,672.872,"Now, look at the various Federal funds that we have in play.",15,,
138,0.97,672.872,681.347,Mostly the funding we're talking about today is the 300 million of funding that Seattle has received from the Arpa bill.,15,,
139,0.97,681.347,687.42,The state and county have also received millions of Arpa dollars.,15,,
140,0.97,687.42,689.121,And that may pass through city.,15,,
141,0.97,689.121,690.089,One is to come.,15,,
142,0.97,690.089,697.863,And just needs a response to slide.,15,,
143,0.97,697.863,698.264,It's just easier.,15,,
144,0.97,698.264,706.338,We're also continuing to work through the FEMA reimbursement pipeline on Theeligible expenses.,15,,
145,0.97,706.338,710.443,"And on the infrastructure bill, they will be announcing deadlines throughout the year.",15,,
146,0.97,710.443,722.121,"And city departments are under way, analyzing the bill for opportunities and preparing to apply.",15,,
147,0.97,722.121,722.588,On FEMA update.,15,,
148,0.97,722.588,732.198,Of the $27 million of potentially emergency costs in the pipeline for FEMA reimbursement.,15,,
149,0.97,732.198,736.302,They have statuses ranging from Presubmission to office of emergency management.,15,,
150,0.97,736.302,739.939,"To under review, to state review, and FEMA review.",15,,
151,0.97,739.939,744.61,We've had over $12 million worth approved by FEMA.,15,,
152,0.97,744.61,750.516,And half million of that has been received so far.,15,,
153,0.97,750.516,755.654,"Separately, another 13 million of invoices also submitted to public health Seattle, King County.",15,,
154,0.97,755.654,763.329,"And of that 13 million, we've received over $12 million in reimbursements.",15,,
155,0.97,763.329,772.671,All are factored into the revenue productions.,15,,
156,0.97,772.671,777.376,Protections.,15,,
157,0.97,777.376,778.01,They are complicated.,15,,
158,0.97,778.01,780.513,That's thanks to rules and requirements that continue to expand.,15,,
159,0.97,780.513,791.724,"But at the same time, as we're continuing to implement these programs and track spending and gather newly required information to report to Treasury.",15,,
160,0.97,791.724,797.463,We've also launched required evaluation work for the programs.,15,,
161,0.97,797.463,797.863,So on board.,15,,
162,0.97,797.863,798.264,They're excited.,15,,
163,0.97,798.264,802.601,"And work is under way with them, collaborating with departments.",15,,
164,0.97,802.601,812.511,And that will enable us to understand and share the impacts that our investments have had and will have.,15,,
165,0.97,812.511,818.35,So this slide describes the various reports that we're producing.,15,,
166,0.97,818.35,832.131,"And last week, end of April, the city successfully submitted its second quarterly project and expense report to Treasury.",15,,
167,0.97,832.131,838.27,"Cliffer departments and Seattle rescue plan team for their teamwork and hard work, pulling that together, starting over a month ago.",15,,
168,0.97,838.27,862.394,"And in fact, one of our colleagues at City wide accounting and Payroll/Fas, Doug HOR Mel Crane, has been sharing with other jurisdictions with managing the challenging Lodgistics at this year's national conference of the government Finance operative Association.",15,,
169,0.97,862.394,865.431,These funds are difficult to administer.,15,,
170,0.97,865.431,870.035,And Seattle is seen as a leading city in our implementation.,15,,
171,0.97,870.035,870.87,So that's great.,15,,
172,0.97,870.87,872.104,That's really exciting.,16,,
173,0.97,872.104,875.808,Please pass on our congratulations and appreciation as well.,16,,
174,0.97,875.808,876.976,And look forward to highlighting that.,16,,
175,0.97,876.976,880.379,"And if there is the possibility of tuning in, I'd love to do that.",16,,
176,0.97,880.379,885.618,We have been invited to a number of national forums to talk about the appropriations.,16,,
177,0.97,885.618,886.151,And where they're going.,16,,
178,0.97,886.151,891.79,And the importance of those and how those dollars get out the door is probably the most important part.,16,,
179,0.97,891.79,897.529,So thanks so much for the work that you've done and please pass on our congratulations to them as well.,16,,
180,0.97,897.529,897.796,Great.,17,,
181,0.97,897.796,898.097,Thank you.,17,,
182,0.97,898.097,903.002,And we will do that.,17,,
183,0.97,903.002,909.875,"The other of the two required regular reports of Treasury, is the annual recovery plan performance report want.",17,,
184,0.97,909.875,915.414,That provides a high-level look at our entire plan for Cliffer and spending.,17,,
185,0.97,915.414,918.15,But really focuses on Metrics and results of our performance.,17,,
186,0.97,918.15,923.822,And the next report will be due at the end of July.,17,,
187,0.97,923.822,931.964,And we're looking forward to having more to share.,17,,
188,0.97,931.964,942.408,We are also looking at public spending portal . tell be on Seattle plan rescue performance spending results.,17,,
189,0.97,942.408,944.143,And we'll launch in phases.,17,,
190,0.97,944.143,946.578,The first phase is spending progress.,17,,
191,0.97,946.578,949.448,And we've got a launch target at the beginning of June.,17,,
192,0.97,949.448,955.688,"And in the second phase, we'll add performance to the portal, with launch projected at the beginning of August.",17,,
193,0.97,955.688,962.961,Lining up with when we get that July report out.,17,,
194,0.97,962.961,969.335,These next two slides are a reminder of Councilmember Herbold has a question.,17,,
195,0.97,969.335,970.269,Thanks so much.,18,,
196,0.97,970.269,972.237,Thank you so much.,19,,
197,0.97,972.237,975.207,I missed the instructions at the beginning.,19,,
198,0.97,975.207,980.579,I do have a couple of questions on slide 3 and 4.,19,,
199,0.97,980.579,1006.972,"First, just as it relates to the food assistance, I appreciate the reference to Council's slide, trying to find out what we know about how much Arpa funds may still pass through to Seattle and just wondering if you have a preview of what you might know about that.",19,,
200,0.97,1006.972,1017.282,"And then Secondly, just interested to know what we've learned about FEMA reimbursement, dressed on slide 4.",19,,
201,0.97,1017.282,1028.06,Have we experienced a change as it relates to timeliness of receiving approval of reimbursements from Femafrom our early experiences.,19,,
202,0.97,1028.06,1029.028,Those are great questions.,20,,
203,0.97,1029.028,1031.497,I can give a little bit on both.,20,,
204,0.97,1031.497,1034.933,Certainly more detail as they come into the actual response.,20,,
205,0.97,1034.933,1048.047,"But in their budget this year, the state appropriated an additional $58 million for a program to send support to local food assistance organizations around the state.",20,,
206,0.97,1048.047,1051.583,So there's a lot of money that they're putting out to organizations around the state.,20,,
207,0.97,1051.583,1062.06,And previous rounds of it have reached organizations serving the Seattle area.,20,,
208,0.97,1062.06,1074.039,"As for the FEMA question, what we're starting to see now are these big programs, big reimbursement requests that we had put in for 2020 projects coming through now.",20,,
209,0.97,1074.039,1077.209,It's a pretty long time line still.,20,,
210,0.97,1077.209,1080.345,But they're starting to show results.,20,,
211,0.97,1080.345,1084.55,Thank you.,21,,
212,0.97,1084.55,1084.917,Okay.,22,,
213,0.97,1084.917,1085.517,William.,23,,
214,0.97,1085.517,1088.487,I just want to take a quick second to thank you for that.,23,,
215,0.97,1088.487,1094.893,"And if folks do have burning questions through the presentation, please go ahead and raise your hand.",23,,
216,0.97,1094.893,1098.697,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for the reminder.",23,,
217,0.97,1098.697,1099.531,The presentation is 24 slides.,23,,
218,0.97,1099.531,1102.534,So we want to make sure to get through all of them.,23,,
219,0.97,1102.534,1105.204,We do have an hour for this now.,23,,
220,0.97,1105.204,1116.215,"So we will make sure to walk through each slide, but if you do have a burning question, it's probably best to ask during so it doesn't get lost towards the end.",23,,
221,0.97,1116.215,1119.985,And I also want to thank the Department directors who are with us here today.,23,,
222,0.97,1119.985,1124.79,I know I had a few questions.,23,,
223,0.97,1124.79,1132.364,"And if there's questions that need to be taken back to various departments, we'll make sure there is a running list as well.",23,,
224,0.97,1132.364,1132.564,Okay.,23,,
225,0.97,1132.564,1132.965,Let's go ahead.,23,,
226,0.97,1132.965,1143.408,These next two slides are a reminder of the various Seattle rescue plan packages that accepted these Federal grant monies.,24,,
227,0.97,1143.408,1146.011,You've seen these before.,24,,
228,0.97,1146.011,1155.187,"And then this slide, the chart shows the change in status of spending since our January 1 update to this Committee.",24,,
229,0.97,1155.187,1165.264,"And since January, on Sr51 program, it says additional $2.5 million in spending and encumbrances.",24,,
230,0.97,1165.264,1169.434,And others that aren't in the system yet.,24,,
231,0.97,1169.434,1172.004,$8.3 million of this changes in more spending recorded.,24,,
232,0.97,1172.004,1180.379,"And you can see in this change from that yellow slice in the January column, reducing and turning into more blue and green.",24,,
233,0.97,1180.379,1187.085,That's a change moving from In- process contracts to now being spent.,24,,
234,0.97,1187.085,1194.56,This table is just numbers behind that column chart.,24,,
235,0.97,1194.56,1196.461,And this is a table showing.,24,,
236,0.97,1196.461,1199.064,Can you go back one VIDE for me?,25,,
237,0.97,1199.064,1199.298,Yep.,26,,
238,0.97,1199.298,1201.867,So I'm looking at slide 10 here.,27,,
239,0.97,1201.867,1202.301,Just to confirm.,27,,
240,0.97,1202.301,1211.743,This means we have about 40 million of appropriated Seattle rescue plan dollars that are still not in progress.,27,,
241,0.97,1211.743,1212.144,Is that correct?,27,,
242,0.97,1212.144,1213.278,That's right.,28,,
243,0.97,1213.278,1213.946,Okay.,29,,
244,0.97,1213.946,1224.323,And can you confirm that that dollar amount is updated as of this presentation and what it might mean to not be in progress?,29,,
245,0.97,1224.323,1224.489,So.,29,,
246,0.97,1224.489,1224.79,Uh-huh.,30,,
247,0.97,1224.79,1232.197,What's the range of work that needs to get done in order for it to be in progress and on its way out the door?,31,,
248,0.97,1232.197,1232.564,Yeah.,32,,
249,0.97,1232.564,1246.979,"So this is updated as of shortly after two weeks ago, back when we were preparing for the last committee.",32,,
250,0.97,1246.979,1247.312,It varies.,32,,
251,0.97,1247.312,1248.413,It includes a large chunk.,32,,
252,0.97,1248.413,1253.251,"You'll see it on the latest slide, which is for affordable housing.",32,,
253,0.97,1253.251,1257.522,And that's pending housing and urban development.,32,,
254,0.97,1257.522,1258.957,Federal agency's approval of Seattle's plan.,32,,
255,0.97,1258.957,1260.525,That's a large chunk of it.,32,,
256,0.97,1260.525,1268.367,Some of these things are programs that are in progress or planning with departments.,32,,
257,0.97,1268.367,1272.07,We may not see that in our system yet.,32,,
258,0.97,1272.07,1276.441,And the other departments may not have communicated to us.,32,,
259,0.97,1276.441,1280.212,"Or actually, we've already gotten agreement with the other organizations in place.",32,,
260,0.97,1280.212,1287.786,Some of that isn't really super quickly communicated in our system or in our regular monthly updates.,32,,
261,0.97,1287.786,1292.124,So they try to step share with us as much as they can.,32,,
262,0.97,1292.124,1295.093,"About, Okay, the system shows the spending.",32,,
263,0.97,1295.093,1298.23,The system shows contracts that have been put into that system.,32,,
264,0.97,1298.23,1309.007,"We've also got these verbal or otherwise negotiated agreements with departments, but they may not share every last bit.",32,,
265,0.97,1309.007,1309.541,That's happened there.,32,,
266,0.97,1309.541,1313.945,And I'll share a few of these in the economic recovery section.,32,,
267,0.97,1313.945,1316.715,Very helpful.,33,,
268,0.97,1316.715,1317.716,Thank you so much.,33,,
269,0.97,1317.716,1318.317,Councilmember Nelson?,33,,
270,0.97,1318.317,1319.685,And this can wait.,34,,
271,0.97,1319.685,1320.385,Thank you very much.,34,,
272,0.97,1320.385,1327.159,You just said you were going to talk about economic recovery section later.,34,,
273,0.97,1327.159,1334.232,"I am zeroing in on the 45%, which is better than the 38% in the slide last time.",34,,
274,0.97,1334.232,1337.402,So I know that progress is being made.,34,,
275,0.97,1337.402,1342.808,And it's a challenge to get money out and encumbered.,34,,
276,0.97,1342.808,1352.25,"So I wanted later in the presentation to talk about that number, 45% and what we can expect in the next quarter or so.",34,,
277,0.97,1352.25,1355.253,Thanks.,34,,
278,0.97,1355.253,1355.62,Thank you.,35,,
279,0.97,1355.62,1360.959,I'll keep moving then.,35,,
280,0.97,1360.959,1369.301,"Seattle rescue plan 3. so as chair Mosqueda noted, it's part of the 2022 budget.",35,,
281,0.97,1369.301,1373.105,And second is funding.,35,,
282,0.97,1373.105,1374.873,This is similar to Srp1.,35,,
283,0.97,1374.873,1376.742,Couple of things to note.,35,,
284,0.97,1376.742,1387.219,"Much is allocated to pay for city staff over the next several years, carrying out things like the queen city initiative, administering the Clfr funds, doing evaluation.",35,,
285,0.97,1387.219,1390.589,"So we've marked that in progress, because that's city staffing.",35,,
286,0.97,1390.589,1392.424,We have that where that's going.,35,,
287,0.97,1392.424,1402.2,The other big thing here is that 66 million of Clfr was used for one-time bolster for government services.,35,,
288,0.97,1402.2,1404.369,So that's a large chunk that is accounted for.,35,,
289,0.97,1404.369,1412.277,And you can see that in the lower number also in our grand total.,35,,
290,0.97,1412.277,1412.644,The allocation.,35,,
291,0.97,1412.644,1414.579,And just to note there.,36,,
292,0.97,1414.579,1419.518,"It Harkens back to the conversation we had at the beginning of this, when we invited national partners in.",36,,
293,0.97,1419.518,1424.823,So talk about what they saw from the last session.,36,,
294,0.97,1424.823,1427.359,And what they invested in core.,36,,
295,0.97,1427.359,1440.939,Saw fast recovery for both the private sector and continued implement and prosperity for the entire jurisdiction was more possible when those government services didn't see dramatic cuts.,36,,
296,0.97,1440.939,1446.778,"You know, I wanted to bring that up, because it was two years ago now that we had some of those national presentations.",36,,
297,0.97,1446.778,1451.283,And the data was really clear from that recession that we saw about 10 years ago.,36,,
298,0.97,1451.283,1458.056,"So I just wanted to tie in the next as to the private market as well, and our overall health of the local economy.",36,,
299,0.97,1458.056,1462.961,That's a great point.,37,,
300,0.97,1462.961,1468.6,"And it is also for our work, reaching out to the community to recover.",37,,
301,0.97,1468.6,1470.001,Absolutely.,37,,
302,0.97,1470.001,1475.273,"The remainder of this presentation, I'll be doing updates on some spending areas.",37,,
303,0.97,1475.273,1484.216,"On this slide is the catch assistance program, which previously you knew already, completed.",37,,
304,0.97,1484.216,1491.423,"What's showing up here the Ngo and Wira, to implement the program.",37,,
305,0.97,1491.423,1494.359,Previous now Rebranded as Scaler Fund.,37,,
306,0.97,1494.359,1498.53,Has provided final results on this program.,37,,
307,0.97,1498.53,1501.166,Including information received about assistance.,37,,
308,0.97,1501.166,1506.071,"And these pie charts show this, raising up the city and environment application.",37,,
309,0.97,1506.071,1511.676,Phase 1 was about reaching out to recipients of the 2020 cash assistance program.,37,,
310,0.97,1511.676,1516.915,Focused on people who weren't eligible to benefit from Federal cash assistance programs.,37,,
311,0.97,1516.915,1527.359,"So as such, makes sense that this space reached overwhelmingly Latin American and immigration populations.",37,,
312,0.97,1527.359,1539.971,"On the other hand, phase 2 was an application, open application and you can see a much wider distribution of recipients.",37,,
313,0.97,1539.971,1547.979,The pie chart on the right shows the percentage of recipients who were experiencing various challenges.,37,,
314,0.97,1547.979,1551.449,"And most notably, you can see unstable houses.",37,,
315,0.97,1551.449,1552.651,"Lost jobs, lost income.",37,,
316,0.97,1552.651,1561.259,We're going to have more to come like this on other SRP programs in the August update.,37,,
317,0.97,1561.259,1567.799,And we'll have more to share about what our programs have accomplished by then.,37,,
318,0.97,1567.799,1569.701,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",38,,
319,0.97,1569.701,1570.068,Thank you.,39,,
320,0.97,1570.068,1575.84,I know I often return to this theme when we talk about this program.,39,,
321,0.97,1575.84,1581.813,I appreciate knowing that there's going to be a deeper dive on the program.,39,,
322,0.97,1581.813,1599.13,"I want to just flag that my office has been working with central staff to see if it's possible to dig into, deeper into the data, to determine how well the fund reached all of the priority populations.",39,,
323,0.97,1599.13,1615.814,"I've expressed a concern in the past that one of the priority populations intended to receive this direct cash assistance was arts and cultural workers, who, as we all know, have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic.",39,,
324,0.97,1615.814,1623.321,And sort of the initial review of the data thus far.,39,,
325,0.97,1623.321,1648.613,"Does not demonstrate that the model used to get these dollars out the door was a model that ensured that, you know, beyond telling, working with arts organizations to do outreach, to tell people that you could go to scholarship junkies to apply for this.",39,,
326,0.97,1648.613,1659.758,It doesn't appear from our first look at the data that many arts and cultural workers were actually recipients of this funding.,39,,
327,0.97,1659.758,1666.398,"There's a couple of different cuts of analysis, I think, that needs to be done.",39,,
328,0.97,1666.398,1669.2,But I'm just wanting to flag.,39,,
329,0.97,1669.2,1678.209,"I hope that we can work with two the executive in doing this deeper dive, that it sounds like you're already working on.",39,,
330,0.97,1678.209,1679.844,"Thanks, Councilmember Herbold.",40,,
331,0.97,1679.844,1684.015,We would hope to.,40,,
332,0.97,1684.015,1691.423,"I understand that scholar Fund, the application process that they took didn't necessarily ask about the industry.",40,,
333,0.97,1691.423,1700.465,So it's hard to know how many or how few of the bulk of the recipients weren't arts and cultural.,40,,
334,0.97,1700.465,1703.268,But for the few working in Seattle and living outside.,40,,
335,0.97,1703.268,1703.802,Then they did ask.,40,,
336,0.97,1703.802,1709.607,"And you could see it, but it was a relatively small group.",40,,
337,0.97,1709.607,1712.777,"Dr. Ken, I see you on the screen as well.",41,,
338,0.97,1712.777,1717.415,Did you have anything else you would like to add as well?,41,,
339,0.97,1717.415,1723.254,"And thank you, vice chair Herbold for adding.",41,,
340,0.97,1723.254,1743.408,"The only thing I'd like to add, the office of AG affairs has the Organization for scholarship junkies is that we did partner with arts and culture and had community engagement contracts with arts Sorks.",42,,
341,0.97,1743.408,1751.249,"So I'm seeing from some of my folks that there is data available, that we can help provide.",42,,
342,0.97,1751.249,1754.319,And it's around the creative space or sector.,42,,
343,0.97,1754.319,1757.589,So we'll be sure to follow up and make sure we provide that information.,42,,
344,0.97,1757.589,1760.925,In partnership with office of arts and culture.,42,,
345,0.97,1760.925,1761.226,Great.,43,,
346,0.97,1761.226,1761.526,Thank you.,43,,
347,0.97,1761.526,1768.333,I know there's a lot of interest in making sure the folks in the creative economy get these dollars as directed.,43,,
348,0.97,1768.333,1770.368,We look forward to that update.,43,,
349,0.97,1770.368,1773.505,"And thanks for flagging that again, vice chair.",43,,
350,0.97,1773.505,1773.872,Let's continue.,43,,
351,0.97,1773.872,1777.742,Okay.,44,,
352,0.97,1777.742,1780.311,And the next slide shows some programs.,44,,
353,0.97,1780.311,1785.416,The first item is from Seattle rescue plan 1.,44,,
354,0.97,1785.416,1791.422,It is entirely obligated and about a third of it is budget consent.,44,,
355,0.97,1791.422,1792.023,And that's ongoing.,44,,
356,0.97,1792.023,1803.301,The next few are from Seattle rescue plan 3. and Seattle rescue plan 3 allocated funding earlier in Covid programs in 2022.,44,,
357,0.97,1803.301,1808.473,And 10 million has been encumbered so far for the continuation of this program since spending is under way.,44,,
358,0.97,1808.473,1820.585,And the last program on the slide is for support to Low- income American Indian and Alaskan native people.,44,,
359,0.97,1820.585,1828.86,Expected to begin in the late summer.,44,,
360,0.97,1828.86,1833.498,On housing Affordability.,44,,
361,0.97,1833.498,1837.001,Affordable housing rapid acquisitions have a couple of different grants here.,44,,
362,0.97,1837.001,1848.112,The Clfr funds are all completely allocated and spent for small pieces on its way to Phoenix to purchase new multifamily buildings.,44,,
363,0.97,1848.112,1851.382,And total of 198 units.,44,,
364,0.97,1851.382,1855.086,"Among them with occupancy, open for occupancy this year.",44,,
365,0.97,1855.086,1858.189,I mentioned earlier in the presentation.,44,,
366,0.97,1858.189,1863.661,Currently awaiting HUD approval for the plan.,44,,
367,0.97,1863.661,1866.631,Emergency rental assistance.,44,,
368,0.97,1866.631,1870.401,When funds have been completely nearly spent.,44,,
369,0.97,1870.401,1872.403,And year a two funds.,44,,
370,0.97,1872.403,1876.407,With United way having completed their spending.,44,,
371,0.97,1876.407,1884.782,"And Lastly, all three million of Clfr funds for affordable housing provided capacity building are now under contract.",44,,
372,0.97,1884.782,1888.886,So just a few questions on this slide.,45,,
373,0.97,1888.886,1895.827,"And thanks for flagging the home and grant being in H.U.D., HUD's approval.",45,,
374,0.97,1895.827,1899.631,We know that they've changed their application process sort of Midway.,45,,
375,0.97,1899.631,1904.202,So look forward to getting final approval it from them for the good work that office of housing is doing.,45,,
376,0.97,1904.202,1912.01,And this is an area that has caught a lot of attention across the nation as we talked to locals across the cities.,45,,
377,0.97,1912.01,1917.649,"People are very impressed by the rapid acquisition program that, is embedded in the use of these dollars.",45,,
378,0.97,1917.649,1938.202,"And I just wanted to flag for folks, within the last year alone, in combination between Federal dollars and state dollars, we have been able to take seven properties off the private market and convert those seven properties into 400 units of housing by using rapid acquisition dollars.",45,,
379,0.97,1938.202,1941.572,"It's a great effort, partnership with these Federal dollars.",45,,
380,0.97,1941.572,1945.243,"And more to come, hopefully, once we get the home dollars approved.",45,,
381,0.97,1945.243,1948.346,Is there anything that you need from us on the HUD approval?,45,,
382,0.97,1948.346,1951.416,Or are we just in wait mode right now?,45,,
383,0.97,1951.416,1955.653,"As I understand it, we're in wait mode.",46,,
384,0.97,1955.653,1959.09,"And you know, just opened up they need to approve our plan.",46,,
385,0.97,1959.09,1959.991,"Okay, great.",47,,
386,0.97,1959.991,1967.999,I do have a question for the emergency rental assistance for E.R.A.2.,47,,
387,0.97,1967.999,1970.868,What percentage of applicants will the funds serve?,47,,
388,0.97,1970.868,1975.54,And when will we know that the entire funds have been spent?,47,,
389,0.97,1975.54,1979.877,I don't have that information off the top of my head.,48,,
390,0.97,1979.877,2018.95,So I'll need to this is for Mul buildings with 198 units.,48,,
391,0.97,2018.95,2035.333,And [inaudible] how many of those units will be for shelter and how many for permanent housing.,48,,
392,0.97,2035.333,2048.78,And what do we know more specifically around their open dates?,48,,
393,0.97,2049.614,2052.917,Operates the shelter for now.,49,,
394,0.97,2052.917,2063.294,"But then eventually after they figure this out, it will transition to affordable housing.",49,,
395,0.97,2063.294,2065.997,We had other problems but can get back to you on that.,50,,
396,0.97,2065.997,2070.701,Thank you.,51,,
397,0.97,2070.701,2074.405,And Spooking of shelters.,52,,
398,0.97,2074.405,2087.885,This slide is about homelessness and the city's investments in Kcrha.,52,,
399,0.97,2087.885,2093.524,It has started operating and has the oversight of the city's homelessness contracts.,52,,
400,0.97,2093.524,2099.53,And this table shows the Clfr- funded pieces.,52,,
401,0.97,2099.53,2109.907,This has been signed.,52,,
402,0.97,2112.577,2113.344,Eight contracts executed.,52,,
403,0.97,2113.344,2116.18,And three more under review.,52,,
404,0.97,2116.18,2123.087,And then rapid Rehousing has about a million contracts with remainder for Nofa in May.,52,,
405,0.97,2123.087,2127.425,No expected releases in May.,52,,
406,0.97,2127.425,2127.959,Nofa in April.,52,,
407,0.97,2127.959,2132.396,Expected to sign the contract in May.,52,,
408,0.97,2132.396,2141.005,And the villages was expected to be at the end of April.,52,,
409,0.97,2141.005,2145.376,"All right, folks.",53,,
410,0.97,2145.376,2145.576,Yeah.,53,,
411,0.97,2145.576,2148.246,Let's stay on slide 16 for a second.,53,,
412,0.97,2148.246,2155.219,Any questions from our representatives on the Rha board?,53,,
413,0.97,2155.219,2156.621,Councilmembers Herbold or Lewis?,53,,
414,0.97,2156.621,2159.157,I have a quick question here.,53,,
415,0.97,2159.157,2167.798,So there's roughly $9 million in unspent Rg dollars.,53,,
416,0.97,2167.798,2171.903,We also allocated for tiny House villages that have not been spent.,53,,
417,0.97,2171.903,2178.843,I believe that was $2.4 million for both the Capitol and operating for this share over at Rha as well.,53,,
418,0.97,2178.843,2186.384,"We all are very interested, as has been noted by my colleagues in making sure that we're able to sustain just care through the end of the year.",53,,
419,0.97,2186.384,2192.523,"I see Joseph, who has joined us on scene.",53,,
420,0.97,2192.523,2199.096,Looking forward to hearing an update on how the King County homelessness authority is planning to use the Esg dollars.,53,,
421,0.97,2199.096,2201.866,I know I've had a few conversations with folks over there.,53,,
422,0.97,2201.866,2206.003,I know folks here on the phone probably have as well.,53,,
423,0.97,2206.003,2223.154,"Some interest in using part of the Underspent to do some Covid- related enhancements to contracts, which is clearly needed to make sure as more folks come into shelter, that we continue to maintain Noncongregate shelter and make sure they're a healthy environment.",53,,
424,0.97,2223.154,2227.124,So that people do not continue to courteous contract Covid.,53,,
425,0.97,2227.124,2230.795,But we appreciate that the Covid mitigation efforts are being put into place.,53,,
426,0.97,2230.795,2242.84,"I think that there is real interest in making sure that the, any remaining funds for this year are directed towards just care.",53,,
427,0.97,2242.84,2247.545,"And I believe that's a shared priority as well, with Rha.",53,,
428,0.97,2247.545,2267.665,"So I'm wondering if there is any update on what the shortfall is in the Ncfrp, thanks to the changes being made to Commerce funds and what the changes are, I know you can't speak on behalf of Rha.",53,,
429,0.97,2267.665,2271.335,But what the plan might be.,53,,
430,0.97,2271.335,2271.736,Thanks.,54,,
431,0.97,2271.736,2277.608,The funds I'll need to defer to Joe first.,54,,
432,0.97,2277.608,2280.311,"Good morning, Madam chair.",55,,
433,0.97,2280.311,2285.65,"This is a top priority between H SD and of course, regional housing authority.",55,,
434,0.97,2285.65,2287.218,But I don't have specific Detailsa the this time.,55,,
435,0.97,2287.218,2295.76,"And I will have to provide that detailed information back to you at a subsequent, you know, later, at a later time.",55,,
436,0.97,2295.76,2296.093,Wonderful.,56,,
437,0.97,2296.093,2296.327,Okay.,56,,
438,0.97,2296.327,2298.462,Thank you very much.,56,,
439,0.97,2298.462,2305.503,"And the regional homelessness authority, I know is continuing to identify what to do with those dollars.",56,,
440,0.97,2305.503,2311.542,I think they've expressed interest in just cares.,56,,
441,0.97,2311.542,2316.414,So seems like there should be a path to make sure they receive funding.,56,,
442,0.97,2316.414,2319.917,With additional funds that come later this year.,56,,
443,0.97,2319.917,2324.355,But we all have the same funds available.,56,,
444,0.97,2324.355,2328.192,Looking forward to getting that addressed.,56,,
445,0.97,2328.192,2330.327,"Dr. Fiduchi, do you have anything to add?",56,,
446,0.97,2330.327,2340.538,"I wanted to note that I believe that Marc Donees will be presenting today, later at the public assets and homelessness committee.",57,,
447,0.97,2340.538,2343.841,Also there may be a chance to check in with them at that time.,57,,
448,0.97,2343.841,2346.143,And we have the chair of that committee with us.,58,,
449,0.97,2346.143,2350.047,So I look forward to having those items discussed in greater detail there.,58,,
450,0.97,2350.047,2356.42,I know folks are not able to speak on behalf of a third entity of the regional homeless authority.,58,,
451,0.97,2356.42,2362.827,"But since there's so much shared interest and the opportunity to use these Federal dollars, that seems prudent of us to have asked the question today.",58,,
452,0.97,2362.827,2366.33,And look forward to hearing more about that this afternoon.,58,,
453,0.97,2366.33,2369.2,Any additional questions for slide 16 here?,58,,
454,0.97,2369.2,2377.641,"Seeing none, let's go ahead and move on.",58,,
455,0.97,2377.641,2380.878,Child care.,59,,
456,0.97,2380.878,2384.415,"Particular, child care facilities.",59,,
457,0.97,2384.415,2389.854,Coordinating outreach and recruitment on child care and their facilities.,59,,
458,0.97,2389.854,2391.922,Posted two positions for project facilities coordinator.,59,,
459,0.97,2391.922,2395.192,"And those postings have closed now, to increase capacity for this program.",59,,
460,0.97,2395.192,2400.564,"And on this slide, it's also a time line of what is to come for child care facilities.",59,,
461,0.97,2400.564,2404.935,A survey of child care providers completed its period on April 22nd.,59,,
462,0.97,2404.935,2413.511,"And that survey is going to be used to form deals, which will be released in May.",59,,
463,0.97,2413.511,2422.186,"And released Rfp, which has a target of May 16th.",59,,
464,0.97,2422.186,2427.091,And Rfq for architectural support for their capital improvement plans.,59,,
465,0.97,2427.091,2435.566,And can contact us directly to learn more at the E-mail that is on this slide.,59,,
466,0.97,2435.566,2435.9,Thank you.,60,,
467,0.97,2435.9,2439.703,"And director Chen, thank you for being here with us with your team.",60,,
468,0.97,2439.703,2444.942,Is there anything that you would like to add to that summary or time line?,60,,
469,0.97,2444.942,2454.285,I think the only thing I'd like to add is that we are on target for the May 16th.,61,,
470,0.97,2454.285,2459.089,"And we have you know, I wish we could have expedited this faster.",61,,
471,0.97,2459.089,2459.924,But here we are.,61,,
472,0.97,2459.924,2463.627,And we're really excited to have this opportunity available.,61,,
473,0.97,2463.627,2468.632,Then we're gearing up to have full staffing capacity to support the various providers.,61,,
474,0.97,2468.632,2473.904,Some who are new to this arena to have access to the funds to expand.,61,,
475,0.97,2473.904,2476.14,"And as you say, seats for Kiddos.",61,,
476,0.97,2476.14,2479.009,So we're really happy to partner with you on this.,61,,
477,0.97,2479.009,2479.61,Great.,62,,
478,0.97,2479.61,2482.713,Let's get more of those belly buttons into child care.,62,,
479,0.97,2482.713,2491.722,"You know, what I am excited about is also this Mid-May release of the Rfp, for broader child care providers.",62,,
480,0.97,2491.722,2500.03,"Will your team be able to send a Council the Rfp information, so we can push that out widely?",62,,
481,0.97,2500.03,2500.831,So people know.,62,,
482,0.97,2500.831,2505.936,We've gotten a lot of inquiry about how to access these capital dollars.,62,,
483,0.97,2505.936,2513.344,"I'll have people know, it was $5 million and we'll add another million to that.",62,,
484,0.97,2513.344,2520.084,So $6 million in total for those Kiddos to have high quality child care.,62,,
485,0.97,2520.084,2521.485,That's going out in Mid-May.,62,,
486,0.97,2521.485,2530.628,Then when will the providers know that they've received funds for building out additional spaces or Retrofits to house more Kiddos and classrooms?,62,,
487,0.97,2530.628,2534.265,And this is where I hand it over to Joe.,63,,
488,0.97,2534.265,2534.532,Okay.,64,,
489,0.97,2534.532,2536.1,Thanks again for being with us.,64,,
490,0.97,2536.1,2547.778,The current time line for the Rfp as director Chen stated.,65,,
491,0.97,2547.778,2547.978,Rfp.,65,,
492,0.97,2547.978,2550.614,And may 24th will be the session.,65,,
493,0.97,2550.614,2552.483,June 28th is the plan closure date.,65,,
494,0.97,2552.483,2556.387,July will look for the awarding.,65,,
495,0.97,2556.387,2559.59,Or the awarding of the recipients.,65,,
496,0.97,2559.59,2562.159,And award notification should be sent on August 4TH.,65,,
497,0.97,2562.159,2564.428,And the contract should be signed by August 19th.,65,,
498,0.97,2564.428,2566.33,Okay.,66,,
499,0.97,2566.33,2570.467,Thank you for that.,66,,
500,0.97,2570.467,2574.505,And that is the set time frame that is as fast as they can get out the door.,66,,
501,0.97,2574.505,2577.107,Okay.,66,,
502,0.97,2577.107,2588.852,Could you send a summary of those dates that we can send out to the folks who have been inquiring so they can keep track of those potential dates and any potential links you have.,66,,
503,0.97,2588.852,2592.423,I might have the R Fp when it goes live.,66,,
504,0.97,2592.423,2592.69,Yes.,67,,
505,0.97,2592.69,2595.159,Thank you so much.,68,,
506,0.97,2595.159,2603.4,"I do wish I could get out the door sooner, but I appreciate the progress you've made.",68,,
507,0.97,2603.4,2605.002,I know you've asked about this.,68,,
508,0.97,2605.002,2608.205,And I see that there has been progress made on this and appreciate that.,68,,
509,0.97,2608.205,2618.882,"And also that we're looking at expanding the capital facilities in terms of Brick- And-Mortar, to try to get more child care into Seattle across Seattle.",68,,
510,0.97,2618.882,2620.217,Appreciate it.,68,,
511,0.97,2620.217,2623.153,Let's continue.,68,,
512,0.97,2623.153,2623.754,Right.,69,,
513,0.97,2623.754,2630.26,And on this slide are updates on the community programs that are funded with Clfr.,69,,
514,0.97,2630.26,2635.332,The state has appropriated matching funds for the older Americans acts grant.,69,,
515,0.97,2635.332,2639.203,And we're expecting funds in July.,69,,
516,0.97,2639.203,2649.947,"And for the mental health services Iled in SRP Fund, funding is 100% obligated and spending is under way.",69,,
517,0.97,2649.947,2655.786,"Also, an area where I'm sure vice chair Herbold is happy to see progress being made.",70,,
518,0.97,2655.786,2657.755,That was an area of concern for us.,70,,
519,0.97,2657.755,2658.155,I appreciate it.,70,,
520,0.97,2658.155,2662.76,Thanks.,70,,
521,0.97,2662.76,2674.004,"And now on economic recovery, as noted, departments continue to move forward with planning and Contrcting and spending some of the progress that has been made just isn't in the accounting system yet.",71,,
522,0.97,2674.004,2676.106,And isn't showing up in our monthly report.,71,,
523,0.97,2676.106,2681.745,And one example of that is the neighborhood economic reports program.,71,,
524,0.97,2681.745,2687.684,Our system shows it's maybe Two- thirds encumbered.,71,,
525,0.97,2687.684,2690.02,But it's actually entirely accounted for.,71,,
526,0.97,2690.02,2692.423,With these agreements or providers.,71,,
527,0.97,2692.423,2693.223,So that's committed.,71,,
528,0.97,2693.223,2698.429,But we didn't get the verbal update from them in the report to explain that.,71,,
529,0.97,2698.429,2700.964,We've already made disagreements.,71,,
530,0.97,2700.964,2707.237,And arts is another example here with their cultural organization.,71,,
531,0.97,2707.237,2707.971,The opening grants.,71,,
532,0.97,2707.971,2710.741,It's closed its Rfp.,71,,
533,0.97,2710.741,2714.244,And is now screening applicants before coordinates are Anounced.,71,,
534,0.97,2714.244,2721.018,We expected to show more progress on these things by the August update.,71,,
535,0.97,2721.018,2729.426,And another more technical reason why things may not be showing up is they can take time between when a program is encumbered.,71,,
536,0.97,2729.426,2730.928,And that provider invoices the city.,71,,
537,0.97,2730.928,2736.5,And the city makes a payment and that hits our books.,71,,
538,0.97,2736.5,2739.903,"So more to come, as always.",71,,
539,0.97,2739.903,2742.306,A few follow-up questions.,72,,
540,0.97,2742.306,2745.542,"Councilmember Nelson, please go ahead.",72,,
541,0.97,2745.542,2765.996,"So I think what I heard you just say is that the 45% on the previous slide is not really up to date, that the money for economic recovery and community well being is getting out the door, and there's not the Disconnect that I had maybe perceived earlier, basically.",73,,
542,0.97,2765.996,2772.069,"Because I was wondering if that was a staffing issue in O.E.D., why that wasn't getting out the door.",73,,
543,0.97,2772.069,2774.471,Is that what you were basically saying?,73,,
544,0.97,2774.471,2776.94,I'm saying that's definitely a part of it.,74,,
545,0.97,2776.94,2777.207,Okay.,75,,
546,0.97,2777.207,2784.148,"But I don't want to cross over any real issues here, too.",76,,
547,0.97,2784.148,2785.082,But O.E.D.,76,,
548,0.97,2785.082,2786.016,Has had turnover.,76,,
549,0.97,2786.016,2789.52,They got a new director and things are Ramping back up.,76,,
550,0.97,2789.52,2797.361,But it is also true that there is more progress that has been made than Soshowing up in our monthly reports.,76,,
551,0.97,2797.361,2797.628,Okay.,77,,
552,0.97,2797.628,2797.828,Yeah.,77,,
553,0.97,2797.828,2799.329,Because they basically turned into a grant processing body.,77,,
554,0.97,2799.329,2800.998,And it was really hard to keep up.,77,,
555,0.97,2800.998,2804.134,I just wanted to make sure that money was getting out the door.,77,,
556,0.97,2804.134,2807.471,"And then the--on this slide, let's see.",77,,
557,0.97,2807.471,2815.512,It says--I just want to make sure I have the number right for downtown recovery.,77,,
558,0.97,2815.512,2815.712,1.4.,77,,
559,0.97,2815.712,2819.917,But I thought that there was 2 million for downtown.,77,,
560,0.97,2819.917,2829.66,So is there--am I referring to--2 million was allocated per Council bill 120093.,77,,
561,0.97,2829.66,2832.93,"So I'm just wondering, is the number 2 million?",77,,
562,0.97,2832.93,2833.163,Or 1.4?,77,,
563,0.97,2833.163,2840.27,I may have to get back to you about which items are being included and which total.,78,,
564,0.97,2840.27,2840.537,Okay.,79,,
565,0.97,2840.537,2840.838,All right.,79,,
566,0.97,2840.838,2845.509,Thank you.,79,,
567,0.97,2845.509,2852.583,"I'm wondering--and thank you very much, Councilmember.",80,,
568,0.97,2852.583,2858.789,"I'm wondering, interim director Penuchi, if you have anything you'd like to add on the downtown efforts.",80,,
569,0.97,2858.789,2880.844,My memory was there was more like 4.75 million 22 million with 2 million allocated specifically for downtown neighborhoods.,80,,
570,0.97,2880.844,2882.045,Technical assistance.,80,,
571,0.97,2882.045,2883.914,And didn't have a specific breakdown.,80,,
572,0.97,2883.914,2897.461,Is it possible that there was overlap between specific downtown dollars and other dollars that were also allocated as part of Seattle rescue plan.,80,,
573,0.97,2897.461,2903.3,You can see the five million grant here.,81,,
574,0.97,2903.3,2909.673,"There was also the 500,000 that was not included in that.",81,,
575,0.97,2909.673,2915.412,But similar use total of six million for that particular use.,81,,
576,0.97,2915.412,2917.047,"And of Coure, development and technical assistance pieces.",81,,
577,0.97,2917.047,2923.487,That could be part of what Councilmember is referring to in downtown funding.,81,,
578,0.97,2923.487,2930.093,May not be in that 1.4 million total.,81,,
579,0.97,2930.093,2934.965,"Chair Mosqueda, I think I'll maybe Resummarize what you said.",82,,
580,0.97,2934.965,2950.414,"So the original proposal was 22 million in the economic and recovery space that included both funding for small businesses, arts and cultural organizations and workers.",82,,
581,0.97,2950.414,2960.123,The final bill included $19 million to the office of economic development and $3 million to arts and cultural organizations.,82,,
582,0.97,2960.123,2973.837,"Of the $19 million allocate tode the office of economic development, $7.5 million was specific to those recovery grants, of which 2 million was dedicated specifically to downtown.",82,,
583,0.97,2973.837,2978.442,And $5.5 million was allocated specifically for other business districts.,82,,
584,0.97,2978.442,2984.781,The other funds were not designated for specific Geographies.,82,,
585,0.97,2984.781,2990.253,"They weren't, in some cases for specific type programs, technical assistance.",82,,
586,0.97,2990.253,2993.123,Capital investments and arts and cultural.,82,,
587,0.97,2993.123,2994.124,That sort of thing.,82,,
588,0.97,2994.124,2996.36,But the geography was not specified.,82,,
589,0.97,2996.36,3006.47,"But in the Council's deliberations, it was determined to ensure that there were some amount of funds that were available to support businesses throughout the city.",82,,
590,0.97,3006.47,3016.213,And that was the allocation of the 7.5 million between downtown and business districts.,82,,
591,0.97,3016.213,3016.48,Great.,83,,
592,0.97,3016.48,3016.713,Thanks.,83,,
593,0.97,3016.713,3017.214,And my last question.,83,,
594,0.97,3017.214,3021.084,Specific to the concept about how do we get these dollars out faster.,83,,
595,0.97,3021.084,3024.321,I'm also interested in that.,83,,
596,0.97,3024.321,3029.393,"And Mr. Chen, if it's not for you, if we need to take it back to the Department.",83,,
597,0.97,3029.393,3036.967,But I think we're all interested in how we can help maybe get these dollars out the door faster?,83,,
598,0.97,3036.967,3044.041,And to the degree that the percentage is still not out the door in terms of delay in voices coming in.,83,,
599,0.97,3044.041,3044.975,That's good news.,83,,
600,0.97,3044.975,3049.546,But also still interested very much in helping to get those dollars out.,83,,
601,0.97,3049.546,3050.881,I see director Dingley coming on screen.,83,,
602,0.97,3050.881,3057.187,"And if you have any information about that, I'm sure we'd all be interested in helping out.",83,,
603,0.97,3057.187,3057.554,Absolutely.,84,,
604,0.97,3057.554,3067.431,I also wanted to add that part of this is the groups we're investing in may not be ready to receive those funds.,84,,
605,0.97,3067.431,3073.503,Sometimes that process can take longer.,84,,
606,0.97,3073.503,3075.939,Many of these funds are spoken for.,84,,
607,0.97,3075.939,3078.542,But we don't have a contract that is signed.,84,,
608,0.97,3078.542,3082.946,So they're still working throughout that process.,84,,
609,0.97,3082.946,3085.515,That's just another element that is at play here.,84,,
610,0.97,3085.515,3092.222,Any additional comments or questions on this slide?,85,,
611,0.97,3092.222,3092.422,Okay.,85,,
612,0.97,3092.422,3093.857,"Well, we'll look forward to hearing more.",85,,
613,0.97,3093.857,3098.295,"And if there is anything we can do from your subsequent conversations, please let us know.",85,,
614,0.97,3098.295,3101.798,Thank you.,86,,
615,0.97,3101.798,3105.035,Just briefly on outdoor recollection region.,87,,
616,0.97,3105.035,3107.404,Several of these programs have been completed.,87,,
617,0.97,3107.404,3107.938,On those that haven't.,87,,
618,0.97,3107.938,3114.978,Parks is developing a program for the parks activation program that will be implemented this summer.,87,,
619,0.97,3114.978,3116.313,And the program activities ongoing.,87,,
620,0.97,3116.313,3128.325,This is a matter of the Department working on the accounting side applying for those costs.,87,,
621,0.97,3128.325,3132.362,"And finally, this continues to grow.",88,,
622,0.97,3132.362,3138.668,"This has received over 5,000 applicants and over 600 have applied to two or more programs.",88,,
623,0.97,3138.668,3149.412,As a reminder this is a program that is meant to simplify and streamline applications for aid.,88,,
624,0.97,3149.412,3152.382,They recently added a new program to its roster.,88,,
625,0.97,3152.382,3155.685,Emergency assistance program from city light.,88,,
626,0.97,3155.685,3160.891,And it tracks valuable Dat that we can use in the system.,88,,
627,0.97,3160.891,3171.301,Things like zip codes or the average time it takes to complete different applications which helps us see where we might need to change.,88,,
628,0.97,3171.301,3178.041,So we're looking forward to learning more and after we publish that report.,88,,
629,0.97,3178.041,3181.177,Is this--I'm sorry.,89,,
630,0.97,3181.177,3181.511,That's it.,90,,
631,0.97,3181.511,3183.013,Thank you.,91,,
632,0.97,3183.013,3185.749,That is great.,91,,
633,0.97,3185.749,3202.899,"Can you also tell me, though, is this the same portal that we had been waiting for that was creating a single point of application for people who might be celebrate for a host of various --",91,,
634,0.97,3202.899,3203.166,Yeah.,92,,
635,0.97,3203.166,3207.504,It's been highlighted in the latter part of last year.,92,,
636,0.97,3207.504,3213.61,And started taking out applications.,92,,
637,0.97,3213.61,3216.813,So now it has five city Rosters in his program.,92,,
638,0.97,3216.813,3220.617,And in expansion to one of those.,92,,
639,0.97,3220.617,3222.719,I think it's the scholarship program.,92,,
640,0.97,3222.719,3228.892,And they're working to expand it to Interparks scholarship program.,92,,
641,0.97,3228.892,3241.938,"So it is a portal that is active, but also in progress, growing, adding more programs to it.",92,,
642,0.97,3241.938,3242.172,Great.,92,,
643,0.97,3242.172,3245.141,"Director Panucci, did you want to add anything to that?",93,,
644,0.97,3245.141,3245.375,Yes.,94,,
645,0.97,3245.375,3247.677,"I wanted to add, that for several years.",94,,
646,0.97,3247.677,3253.45,You and your colleagues have been discussing and requesting the development of a single point of access.,94,,
647,0.97,3253.45,3256.219,And the executive has been interested and supportive of that day as well.,94,,
648,0.97,3256.219,3268.765,"But I think the Federal funds have allowed the city to really launch this program and as William described, it is growing, with each update, we see more programs being added to it.",94,,
649,0.97,3268.765,3282.412,"So I think this is the implementation of that idea that has been discussed for several years,.",94,,
650,0.97,3282.412,3286.249,And the dark blue is services that have access to higher rates?,95,,
651,0.97,3286.249,3286.516,Right.,96,,
652,0.97,3286.516,3287.717,Great.,97,,
653,0.97,3287.717,3287.917,Okay.,97,,
654,0.97,3287.917,3292.455,We have about five more minutes for this presentation.,97,,
655,0.97,3292.455,3294.724,"Councilmember Nelson, please go ahead.",97,,
656,0.97,3294.724,3302.032,So back to slide 4. you don't know.,98,,
657,0.97,3302.032,3303.6,It's on slide 11.,98,,
658,0.97,3303.6,3309.406,"It's, the Asterisk says SRP also included 66.3 million.",98,,
659,0.97,3309.406,3317.147,"So Offline, can you just tell me where that went or what that is back filling?",98,,
660,0.97,3317.147,3321.518,That can be just Offline.,98,,
661,0.97,3321.518,3324.287,But this Civiform raised a question.,98,,
662,0.97,3324.287,3325.822,I really applaud this effort.,98,,
663,0.97,3325.822,3339.235,So is there any--are there Funs that communities can access through this site that are not accounted for in the programs that we just went over?,98,,
664,0.97,3339.235,3343.907,So there's still some--or is that--is this in addition to?,98,,
665,0.97,3343.907,3360.09,"Or are those buckets of money that we just discussed in this presentation, separate from other funds that could be accessed through this portal.",98,,
666,0.97,3360.09,3365.562,"So it is separate, as far as the programs that are Onboarded.",99,,
667,0.97,3365.562,3366.262,This helps residents access.,99,,
668,0.97,3366.262,3371.201,"Ultimately, it will be as many as we can get onto the system.",99,,
669,0.97,3371.201,3373.002,Okay.,100,,
670,0.97,3373.002,3375.538,Not specific to just these emergency funds.,101,,
671,0.97,3375.538,3378.174,Got it.,102,,
672,0.97,3378.174,3379.809,Thank you very much.,102,,
673,0.97,3379.809,3385.982,I have a question about hygiene stations and the rest rooms that we included.,103,,
674,0.97,3385.982,3395.258,"We did include funding and I'm not remembering off the top of my head, funding for portable bathrooms and hygiene stations.",103,,
675,0.97,3395.258,3405.635,"And I know that as part of the budget exercise to potentially hold back some funding this year, as we wait for the revenue forecast to sort of pencil out a little bit more.",103,,
676,0.97,3405.635,3409.506,That is part of the area that is being held back.,103,,
677,0.97,3409.506,3410.039,I'm sorry.,103,,
678,0.97,3410.039,3419.249,"I didn't bring this up in the context of the presentation earlier, because it may have fit in with the clean city initiative comments that were made.",103,,
679,0.97,3419.249,3426.456,But I did see Online that there are portable rest rooms being purchased for parks.,103,,
680,0.97,3426.456,3430.794,I think parks personnel who are involved in Sweeps.,103,,
681,0.97,3430.794,3440.203,And I'm wondering if you can comment a little bit about whether or not any of the new American rescue act funds have been used to purchase portable rest rooms.,103,,
682,0.97,3440.203,3443.339,Those are only for city workers.,103,,
683,0.97,3443.339,3450.013,And are we able to identify hygiene facilities that have been purchased for folks in the community that generally need them.,103,,
684,0.97,3450.013,3453.316,We've talked a lot about this over the last few years.,103,,
685,0.97,3453.316,3455.785,But as folks are out for a run or walk.,103,,
686,0.97,3455.785,3458.855,And that could be housed or Unhoused folks.,103,,
687,0.97,3458.855,3466.93,Any of the funds go to purchasing the hygiene facilities as originally envisioned?,103,,
688,0.97,3466.93,3471.334,Not actually familiar with this for the use of Clfr dollars.,104,,
689,0.97,3471.334,3474.103,But would need to look into that.,104,,
690,0.97,3474.103,3478.975,I think maybe mentioned it being considered for a whole term.,104,,
691,0.97,3478.975,3482.478,Might be among the government replacement.,104,,
692,0.97,3482.478,3492.288,"I know among the hundred of programs that we are excited about, this was one that got a lot of attention on Council.",105,,
693,0.97,3492.288,3495.291,And I know it's deeply needed over Covid.,105,,
694,0.97,3495.291,3504.234,But highlighted the need for hygiene facilities.,105,,
695,0.97,3504.234,3507.537,Director Penn Ucucci.,105,,
696,0.97,3507.537,3512.509,It is probably why William isn't specifically tracking that program.,106,,
697,0.97,3512.509,3519.749,And we can follow up off line with director Dingley on those investments.,106,,
698,0.97,3519.749,3520.016,Great.,107,,
699,0.97,3520.016,3523.553,"And vice chair her bold, please go ahead.",107,,
700,0.97,3523.553,3528.825,The report that the camp second chance trailer was purchased and the plumbing is being put in.,108,,
701,0.97,3528.825,3533.363,"And the trailer, I think, opened up for use.",108,,
702,0.97,3533.363,3533.83,Weekend before last.,108,,
703,0.97,3533.83,3535.331,So that's good news.,108,,
704,0.97,3535.331,3535.665,[Laughter],108,,
705,0.97,3535.665,3540.236,That's a great positive point to end on.,109,,
706,0.97,3540.236,3543.706,"And overall, very much appreciates the direction that has been taken.",109,,
707,0.97,3543.706,3553.516,Especially the urgency to get the dollars out in this first quarter of 2022.,109,,
708,0.97,3553.516,3555.618,Thanks again for the transparency.,109,,
709,0.97,3555.618,3562.492,"For me, I know I've been Honing in specifically on the Rv safe lot.",109,,
710,0.97,3562.492,3563.092,"Storage, tiny House village.",109,,
711,0.97,3563.092,3568.398,The funding that we wanted to see for things like direct cash assistance and child care support.,109,,
712,0.97,3568.398,3570.967,So I'm really excited about some of the progress that has been made.,109,,
713,0.97,3570.967,3585.515,And we'll look forward to following up this afternoon and Councilmember Lewis's Committee on homelessness and public assets this afternoon on additional spending from Rha.,109,,
714,0.97,3585.515,3590.586,"Before we close out, are there any additional questions from our colleagues?",109,,
715,0.97,3590.586,3590.787,Okay.,109,,
716,0.97,3590.787,3600.163,"Seeing none, I think that the next time we're hopefully going to be able to hear you is maybe late August, after the revenue forecast is presented.",109,,
717,0.97,3600.163,3607.603,I think our hope was to do an implementation Uptate after we get the revenue forecast.,109,,
718,0.97,3607.603,3609.339,So we can look at strategies.,109,,
719,0.97,3609.339,3614.143,As well as looking forward to the current city revenues.,109,,
720,0.97,3614.143,3616.112,And seeing director Dingley nod.,109,,
721,0.97,3616.112,3619.449,Thanks for all your work.,109,,
722,0.97,3619.449,3620.316,Pass on our consideration.,109,,
723,0.97,3620.316,3629.058,And congratulations again on the National recognition that you've received for tracking and holding our city accountable for spending those dollars.,109,,
724,0.97,3629.058,3636.733,"I know our congressional partners will be excited about that, too.",109,,
725,0.97,3636.733,3638.401,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",110,,
726,0.97,3638.401,3638.935,Thanks so much.,111,,
727,0.97,3638.935,3641.704,We look forward to seeing you next time.,111,,
728,0.97,3641.704,3646.142,"And Julie, I believe you're sticking around with us, director Dingley.",111,,
729,0.97,3646.142,3648.511,Look forward to continuing the conversation.,111,,
730,0.97,3648.511,3652.448,"Colleagues, without further adieu, we are right on track.",111,,
731,0.97,3652.448,3656.719,"Madam clerk, would you please read into the record item number 3.",111,,
732,0.97,3656.719,3659.222,Financial planning for briefing and discussion.,112,,
733,0.97,3659.222,3659.555,Wonderful.,113,,
734,0.97,3659.555,3664.26,"And with us today, we have director Dingley from the city budget's office.",113,,
735,0.97,3664.26,3678.474,We also have with us interim director Aly Pennucci.,113,,
736,0.97,3678.474,3680.51,I'm excited about this presentation.,113,,
737,0.97,3680.51,3681.044,As we Teed up.,113,,
738,0.97,3681.044,3687.15,This is really part two of the conversation that rounds out the fuller picture.,113,,
739,0.97,3687.15,3689.852,"Not only revenue for 2022, 23 and 24.",113,,
740,0.97,3689.852,3697.76,"But really looking ahead, six years ahead is what I really am excited about.",113,,
741,0.97,3697.76,3710.74,"If folks haven't had a chance to read the budget memo, it is 15 pages of various information provided from Tom Mikesell.",113,,
742,0.97,3710.74,3713.876,And it provides what to expect throughout 2022.,113,,
743,0.97,3713.876,3715.478,As we look at the budget situation.,113,,
744,0.97,3715.478,3719.649,Most have heard us talk about what the current budget situation is.,113,,
745,0.97,3719.649,3726.889,And the gap between long-term needs and investments that we have Prioritized and the amount of revenue that we have to meet those needs.,113,,
746,0.97,3726.889,3735.832,"So today, as we walk through this presentation, I think you'll hear a little bit more to round out what that gap currently means.",113,,
747,0.97,3735.832,3737.3,How it came to be.,113,,
748,0.97,3737.3,3745.641,"And some possible ways that we, as a collective, the city family, I should say, since we have the executive on the phone, on the line here as well.",113,,
749,0.97,3745.641,3752.148,As we as a city family look to address some of these needs.,113,,
750,0.97,3752.148,3759.055,I really want to applaud central staff for the work they've done on this memo and thank for the city budget office.,113,,
751,0.97,3759.055,3767.864,"Julie Dingley and your team, especially in the last four months, have been really working in deep Clakdz and partnership with our central staff team.",113,,
752,0.97,3767.864,3768.931,I know that's been appreciated.,113,,
753,0.97,3768.931,3769.999,I appreciate it.,113,,
754,0.97,3769.999,3772.702,And I want you to hear from us directly as well.,113,,
755,0.97,3772.702,3781.811,"On page 2 and 3 of the memo, there are key points that I want to highlight to note the importance of this presentation today.",113,,
756,0.97,3781.811,3800.63,"On page 2, the second paragraph, it really talks about the importance of having a conversation about a six-year financial plan in a transparent accountable way, early, prior to a budget being being transmitted to the legislative branch for consideration and finalization.",113,,
757,0.97,3800.63,3813.309,"In the memo, it notes that rather than a One-Off ad hoc process, periodically reviewing the financial plan, It'Sont Mal optimal when it can be embedded in the process.",113,,
758,0.97,3813.309,3816.579,And that's exactly what I asked central staff to do.,113,,
759,0.97,3816.579,3825.788,"And realizing that this Six- year financial plans or the Six- year outlook, were really embedded into our budget as Apend Ices.",113,,
760,0.97,3825.788,3839.969,You'll NOTE here in the central staff memo that on paragraph 3 it said rather than using this as a guide which is what we have been dog.,113,,
761,0.97,3839.969,3846.776,"In the past, these were included Asaappendices.",113,,
762,0.97,3846.776,3850.947,And they were not disclosed or Duss discussed in a public way like they will be today.,113,,
763,0.97,3850.947,3855.418,This is a really fundamental conversation to make sure there is good budgeting practice.,113,,
764,0.97,3855.418,3859.555,That we have accountable and transparent conversation between branches of government.,113,,
765,0.97,3859.555,3864.694,"And that we're having a discussion with the public as well, about how we look forward to good budgeting with you all in the future.",113,,
766,0.97,3864.694,3878.407,"Want to take a minute to, again, thank the transparency that has come from the city budget's office again under the leadership of director Dingley.",113,,
767,0.97,3878.407,3882.912,Also want to applaud Mayor Harold for the transmission as well.,113,,
768,0.97,3882.912,3885.281,"And colleagues, this is just the beginning of the conversation.",113,,
769,0.97,3885.281,3887.45,This is not for action or a vote here today.,113,,
770,0.97,3887.45,3897.426,"In fact, I think many of us are used to having options presented to us.",113,,
771,0.97,3897.426,3900.997,We will talk about options and scenarios.,113,,
772,0.97,3900.997,3905.368,But that's not option in terms of the proposal we're used to.,113,,
773,0.97,3905.368,3917.38,"This is really to TF a discussion about how we can get to solid budgeting in the future that doesn't look at carryover dollars to sustain budgeting, doesn't look at salary Savingsa a way to plug budget gaps.",113,,
774,0.97,3917.38,3927.356,"And looks at how we can create really strong budget outlook for our city, as we seek to again, thank you very much, for the work that has been done.",113,,
775,0.97,3927.356,3939.902,"No longer are you seeing a financial plan being sent down to us on page 665 quite literally, of last year's budget or page 760 of the previous budget.",113,,
776,0.97,3939.902,3964.86,"This is really an opportunity for us to pull out that Six- year plan, have a detailed discussion, and to then allow for that to really feed into creating a stable budget proposal that the Mayor is working on in collaboration with the city budget's office, that will then serve as the base for the Legislativebranch's deliberations.",113,,
777,0.97,3964.86,3965.361,I'm excited about this.,113,,
778,0.97,3965.361,3967.63,Writing out just over a Six- year financial plan.,113,,
779,0.97,3967.63,3969.432,And I think you'll see why.,113,,
780,0.97,3969.432,3984.914,And I think the central staff has really articulated the importance of the ask that we made of central staff and the hard work that has gone in over the last two years to Dissect this information and have a complete analysis here.,113,,
781,0.97,3984.914,3991.387,"So again, thank you, director Dingley for your partnership and collaboration.",113,,
782,0.97,3991.387,3993.089,"And thank you, Tom and Aly.",113,,
783,0.97,3993.089,3996.992,"And as a reminder, as noted on the last page of the memo.",113,,
784,0.97,3996.992,4001.564,"This six-year financial plan will be updated, every time we receive a revenue forecast.",113,,
785,0.97,4001.564,4006.936,So the next one you will receive as an updated six-year financial plan analysis will be in August.,113,,
786,0.97,4006.936,4008.804,And then after that again in November.,113,,
787,0.97,4008.804,4012.875,But we'll be in the heart of budget deliberations at that time.,113,,
788,0.97,4012.875,4015.611,"So with that, and there should be a drum roll here.",113,,
789,0.97,4015.611,4022.451,I will turn it over to director Dingley.,113,,
790,0.97,4022.451,4023.753,And director Pennucci.,113,,
791,0.97,4023.753,4027.556,And I think Tom will really be leading us through this presentation today.,113,,
792,0.97,4027.556,4029.525,And look forward to hearing your questions.,113,,
793,0.97,4029.525,4031.36,"But really, great amount of work has gone into this.",113,,
794,0.97,4031.36,4041.003,And this again is just the beginning of a longer conversation to come.,113,,
795,0.97,4041.003,4049.512,"We, too, are excited to be here this morning.",113,,
796,0.97,4049.512,4057.253,To begin what we hope to be an ongoing exercise on engaging in the discussion with all of you on the city's general fund.,113,,
797,0.97,4057.253,4063.692,"To say it fills this budget manager's heart with joy, when I hear people talking with such enthusiasm about a financial plan.",113,,
798,0.97,4063.692,4066.262,So thank you for that.,113,,
799,0.97,4066.262,4074.17,I'm just going to provide some Intro remarks and turn it over to Tom.,113,,
800,0.97,4074.17,4081.877,And director Dingley and myself will be here along the way to add additional Contextand to answer additional questions.,113,,
801,0.97,4081.877,4089.418,"So at least since 2019, the general plan has projected that general fund expenditures are outpacing general fund revenues.",113,,
802,0.97,4089.418,4099.095,"You've heard us talking about this in various staff memos this year, in presentation with the budget staff office.",113,,
803,0.97,4099.095,4099.528,And projected gap.,113,,
804,0.97,4099.528,4116.145,"For clarity, because this is a term more commonly used in fiscal policy discussions, our memo and presentation use the term ""deficit,"" but you'll hear us use ""gap can the ""or ""deficit"" Interchangeably.",113,,
805,0.97,4116.145,4130.025,This has become more pronounced in recent years as impacts from the pandemic have met with one- time funding solutions as well as that structural problem that existed Prepandemic.,113,,
806,0.97,4130.025,4141.203,Providing an existent and ongoing review will help us place your current budget discussions in context of how those decisions impact the long- term Sustainability of the general fund.,113,,
807,0.97,4141.203,4153.182,"With this in mind, as chair Mosqueda noted.",113,,
808,0.97,4153.182,4163.759,"3954 that among other things, requested that it provides the six-year budget annually, including disclosure of all the embedded discussions and agreements to share that data.",113,,
809,0.97,4163.759,4166.362,This is another step in implementing that request.,113,,
810,0.97,4166.362,4174.803,We are continuing to work closely with CBO to enhance how and when we receive this data.,113,,
811,0.97,4174.803,4178.307,This presentation would not have been possible without the partnership from that office.,113,,
812,0.97,4178.307,4188.284,"So I want to also personally thank director Dingley, and Caitlin Berger from Ceo.",113,,
813,0.97,4188.284,4190.252,From working Collaboratively with us.,113,,
814,0.97,4190.252,4192.521,Providing information and offering critical feedback on the analysis.,113,,
815,0.97,4192.521,4198.227,I also want to take a moment to highlight the incredible work of Tom Mikesell.,113,,
816,0.97,4198.227,4201.497,His experience in policy and budgeting.,113,,
817,0.97,4201.497,4207.703,His commitment to public service.,113,,
818,0.97,4207.703,4209.138,And his impressive intellectual curiosity.,113,,
819,0.97,4209.138,4215.744,Enhance and expand the analysis we area Toibl bring to our budget and help support the Council's decision making.,113,,
820,0.97,4215.744,4225.254,"And ultimately, the budget that provides critical services and programs to the people who live and work in Seattle.",113,,
821,0.97,4225.254,4227.756,So today.,113,,
822,0.97,4227.756,4231.16,Let's see if I can manage my screens here.,113,,
823,0.97,4231.16,4241.203,"We are going to provide background information on financial planning, review prior and current version of the general fund six-year financial plan.",113,,
824,0.97,4241.203,4246.742,We will look at how Prepandemic plans projected this gap in the budget Fund.,113,,
825,0.97,4246.742,4253.716,"We'll show how based on the adopted budget plan, the impacts made that gap worse.",113,,
826,0.97,4253.716,4257.72,And how recent financial and economic updates have partially reduced that gap.,113,,
827,0.97,4257.72,4271.3,"And looking ahead to the Council's budget process coming this fall, we offer a few scenarios to illustrate how certain optional measures or changes in the economic situation could impact the Sustainability of the general fund.",113,,
828,0.97,4271.3,4277.94,"As chair Mosqueda noted, this is really the first time the Council will look comprehensively at this financial plan.",113,,
829,0.97,4277.94,4288.183,"It is intended to provide information on the balancing situation, as the economy emerges from the pandemic.",113,,
830,0.97,4288.183,4292.021,And provide context on this and engage with the executive on these policy issues.,113,,
831,0.97,4292.021,4298.861,"Again, we will do this again in August and in November as the Council engages in the budget discussions.",113,,
832,0.97,4298.861,4306.635,So we hope to have this be a continual update and discussion that we engage in with all of you and with the executive.,113,,
833,0.97,4306.635,4322.618,"And with that, I will turn it over to Tom to lead the presentation today.",113,,
834,0.97,4325.354,4328.457,"Thank you, Councilmember Pennucci.",114,,
835,0.97,4328.457,4333.562,I wanted to share and echo all voiced in this committee about appreciation.,115,,
836,0.97,4333.562,4337.7,Because none of this could have happened without that collection collaboration.,115,,
837,0.97,4337.7,4342.404,O I'm not going to Belabor the point.,115,,
838,0.97,4342.404,4344.239,But just to echo it and lift that up.,115,,
839,0.97,4344.239,4359.154,"So if we can look at the next VIDE, we'll dive into the analysis of the general fund financial plan.",115,,
840,0.97,4359.154,4368.097,In the upcoming slides we'll be talking about the more complex topics that deal with General Fund and financial planning in general.,115,,
841,0.97,4368.097,4372.534,Some of these will be based on prior budgets.,115,,
842,0.97,4372.534,4377.873,It's important to review them before we look into more detailed information that we'll talk about more this morning.,115,,
843,0.97,4377.873,4383.145,"And by way of terms, one thing that will be discussed frequently is ongoing.",115,,
844,0.97,4383.145,4392.454,"And so in the term--in the context of the budget and financial plan, that essentially is something that shows up in the budget each and every year.",115,,
845,0.97,4392.454,4403.232,"So a good example of that is the salary cost for a regular, so Nontemporary position that provides services in the budget.",115,,
846,0.97,4403.232,4412.808,Each year in the financial plan will account for paying for the salary of that individual in the future.,115,,
847,0.97,4412.808,4417.913,"In contrast, there is the content of a one-time item.",115,,
848,0.97,4417.913,4422.351,So these are more discreet and limited in and nature.,115,,
849,0.97,4422.351,4424.086,Best is a capital project.,115,,
850,0.97,4424.086,4425.487,"You begin, you build the project.",115,,
851,0.97,4425.487,4427.422,And when the project is complete.,115,,
852,0.97,4427.422,4427.756,You are done.,115,,
853,0.97,4427.756,4433.495,And no longer is in the budget as significant item.,115,,
854,0.97,4433.495,4446.508,"Another example, more on the operating budget is, say, a one- time program, focused on providing the service in a specific year.",115,,
855,0.97,4446.508,4448.377,Sometimes I'm given resource constraints.,115,,
856,0.97,4448.377,4450.279,But other times with resources in mind.,115,,
857,0.97,4450.279,4454.149,That not in congratulations to your budgets.,115,,
858,0.97,4454.149,4455.083,Until this matters.,115,,
859,0.97,4455.083,4457.252,Because another term is growth assumptions.,115,,
860,0.97,4457.252,4466.662,So these are the ways that the amounts that are in the current year budget are growing or grown in the future years.,115,,
861,0.97,4466.662,4469.965,So the one that comes to mind first is inflation.,115,,
862,0.97,4469.965,4480.275,"So as prices go up, the cost of what government is purchasing increase because of inflation.",115,,
863,0.97,4480.275,4496.391,"And so in order to accurately measure the revenues that we're expecting to receive against the expenditures, we need to build in some level of growth to account for that expectation in the future.",115,,
864,0.97,4496.391,4500.729,Next term and interim director Pennucci discussed this.,115,,
865,0.97,4500.729,4505.534,It's kind of the purifying financial concept of opposite deficit.,115,,
866,0.97,4505.534,4519.882,"This is really in simple terms, the difference between the resources that we expect to get and the year and annual revenues and the expenditures on government that we plan to make.",115,,
867,0.97,4519.882,4526.922,"Sometimes that gap can be negative, where the expenditures are higher than the revenues we plan to receive.",115,,
868,0.97,4526.922,4530.192,"And other times, the gap can be positive, the other direction.",115,,
869,0.97,4530.192,4537.633,Meaning revenues are higher than the expenditures we're going to make.,115,,
870,0.97,4537.633,4541.57,Another concept is the concept of reserve.,115,,
871,0.97,4541.57,4545.307,In the context of General fund financial plan.,115,,
872,0.97,4545.307,4554.683,These are amount are items that the executive had generally expect to be included in the budget or future budgets.,115,,
873,0.97,4554.683,4558.387,"But yet, it's not exactly a specific legal obligation to do that.",115,,
874,0.97,4558.387,4569.698,"And if they did not account for this in some way, when the time comes to incur that obligation, the money would not be there to make a payment.",115,,
875,0.97,4569.698,4576.872,"So these, oftentimes, will include legal and contractual items that are under negotiation.",115,,
876,0.97,4576.872,4579.341,So their final amounts are not quite known at this time.,115,,
877,0.97,4579.341,4582.277,But there is an estimate that is available.,115,,
878,0.97,4582.277,4587.482,And that estimate is used to account for that future obligation.,115,,
879,0.97,4587.482,4590.152,And then the final term is fund balance.,115,,
880,0.97,4590.152,4598.594,"So the fund balance, the best way to think of this is this is the book end of the city's finances for the year.",115,,
881,0.97,4598.594,4601.229,So we start a fiscal year.,115,,
882,0.97,4601.229,4608.27,"We start a year with an amount in the Fund, in the general fund.",115,,
883,0.97,4608.27,4614.576,"And we receive revenue, which adds resources that are available.",115,,
884,0.97,4614.576,4621.95,"That Council makes appropriations and the departments make money against those appropriations, which reduce the level of resources.",115,,
885,0.97,4621.95,4625.12,We account for the reserves.,115,,
886,0.97,4625.12,4626.388,Those future potential obligations.,115,,
887,0.97,4626.388,4629.324,"And then at the end, it's what is left.",115,,
888,0.97,4629.324,4633.462,"So there's a beginning fund balance, the operations of government take place.",115,,
889,0.97,4633.462,4636.131,And then there's an ending fund balance.,115,,
890,0.97,4636.131,4638.2,And that ending fund balance carries into the next year.,115,,
891,0.97,4638.2,4640.235,And then we go through the cycle again.,115,,
892,0.97,4640.235,4648.01,And you'll see this pattern and the tables that we'll look at in a few slides.,115,,
893,0.97,4648.01,4652.648,"Might be helpful, colleagues, to have our colleagues keep page 3 open.",116,,
894,0.97,4652.648,4657.419,"Just in case you want that glossary of terms with you, the whole time.",116,,
895,0.97,4657.419,4661.289,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",117,,
896,0.97,4661.289,4669.131,And then the--some Acronyms that I will possibly refer to throughout are Gf.,117,,
897,0.97,4669.131,4669.831,So that's general fund.,117,,
898,0.97,4669.831,4671.867,Cbo is the city budget office.,117,,
899,0.97,4671.867,4675.671,"I'll just use financial plan, instead of saying six-year financial plan.",117,,
900,0.97,4675.671,4680.842,That is technically how many years are included.,117,,
901,0.97,4680.842,4685.147,And then office of economic and revenue forecast.,117,,
902,0.97,4685.147,4685.347,Okay.,117,,
903,0.97,4685.347,4688.216,Now we can go to the next slide.,117,,
904,0.97,4688.216,4688.517,Thank you.,117,,
905,0.97,4688.517,4695.824,Some of this has already been covered in prior commentary.,117,,
906,0.97,4695.824,4697.092,What is a financial plan.,117,,
907,0.97,4697.092,4707.102,It is a table or set of numbers that applies that make that we project what Futue revenues and expenditures will look like.,117,,
908,0.97,4707.102,4719.081,"And in making decisions about what numbers to use, we also can reveal what the economic trends that are projected, what the impact those trends have on both budgets and revenues in the plan.",117,,
909,0.97,4719.081,4742.137,"And when you look into longer term, you can identify challenges or potential opportunities that give you more insight and decisions that you're making in the current year.",117,,
910,0.97,4742.137,4745.674,It's to recognize the future implications of decisions being made in the now.,117,,
911,0.97,4745.674,4762.19,And how to recognize that those challenges or opportunities exist and Strategize and a better way to Strategize the current year decisions with site sight on the longer term.,117,,
912,0.97,4762.19,4766.228,Also this is equal importance.,118,,
913,0.97,4766.228,4772.768,"The regular review, and this is the first step on what is going to be a regular process of reviewing the plan, seeing how things change.",118,,
914,0.97,4772.768,4776.671,Seeing how the decisions impact the results.,118,,
915,0.97,4776.671,4784.98,And just kind of informing for the public and for the Council.,118,,
916,0.97,4784.98,4785.914,How those decisions impact.,118,,
917,0.97,4785.914,4790.852,There is factors that impact the plan.,118,,
918,0.97,4790.852,4792.12,Affect the decisions being made.,118,,
919,0.97,4792.12,4794.089,It's kind of a feedback loop.,118,,
920,0.97,4794.089,4801.63,"But it's also not just the document, but the process putting the documents together.",118,,
921,0.97,4801.63,4807.502,"Colleagues, also flag this as one of many efforts that central staff has been working on in partnership with our office.",119,,
922,0.97,4807.502,4823.318,"And some of the conversations I've had with director Dingley as well, about overall, the desire to move from a 12-month adoptive budget and subsequent 12-month indoors budget.",119,,
923,0.97,4823.318,4826.855,We'd love to move something that looks more like biannual budgeting.,119,,
924,0.97,4826.855,4830.058,I'd also love to make sure that our fiscal notes.,119,,
925,0.97,4830.058,4832.761,I know there have been updates.,119,,
926,0.97,4832.761,4840.001,Thank you Councilmember for your work on that.,119,,
927,0.97,4840.001,4841.236,I'm interested in fiscal notes that have a six-year outlook.,119,,
928,0.97,4841.236,4853.481,"[inaudible] and we know that that is going to take sometime and work to see how we can work in partnership with the departments and CPO, as we develop legislation to really have that six-year outlook as part of legislation as well.",119,,
929,0.97,4853.481,4861.523,But this is one component of a broader conservation we've had over the last two years as I've been budget year about how to get the six-year look.,119,,
930,0.97,4861.523,4863.992,Not just for budgeting discussions in the fall.,119,,
931,0.97,4863.992,4868.129,But how we can do that on a routine basis as well.,119,,
932,0.97,4868.129,4869.965,Those are some things that are still in the work.,119,,
933,0.97,4869.965,4887.182,But that type of work on individual legislation in combination with the regular review of a six-year outlook will help provide a more complete analysis as we continue doing the work for city of Seattle.,119,,
934,0.97,4887.182,4888.383,"Director Dingley, please go ahead.",119,,
935,0.97,4888.383,4888.884,"Thank you, chair.",120,,
936,0.97,4888.884,4891.353,I want to highlight something that Tom said.,120,,
937,0.97,4891.353,4894.189,That financial plans are a point in time.,120,,
938,0.97,4894.189,4897.893,So these numbers will naturally shift over time.,120,,
939,0.97,4897.893,4900.462,They're built on the best information at the time they were created.,120,,
940,0.97,4900.462,4903.431,"So in some ways, that can be unsatisfactory.",120,,
941,0.97,4903.431,4907.702,Because not all the answers are available when it it's being being provided.,120,,
942,0.97,4907.702,4911.473,Just something to keep in mind as you're working through this.,120,,
943,0.97,4911.473,4920.382,"Real quick if I may, I want to go back to the comments at the top, about where this shows up in the budget.",120,,
944,0.97,4920.382,4923.051,Cbo looks at how we work with budgets.,120,,
945,0.97,4923.051,4931.626,And as many years as I've been here and long before my time.,120,,
946,0.97,4931.626,4933.561,This is something for the public.,120,,
947,0.97,4933.561,4937.265,For the Council to understand what it is we want you to do for the project.,120,,
948,0.97,4937.265,4941.936,We would be happy to continue to work with you on how that is created.,120,,
949,0.97,4941.936,4946.174,We want to make sure those are represented in way a that is useful.,120,,
950,0.97,4946.174,4954.382,So thank you for that.,120,,
951,0.97,4954.382,4957.018,Thank you.,121,,
952,0.97,4957.018,4965.026,"So now we'll start looking at the actual, some of the financial plans, both historical and revised.",121,,
953,0.97,4965.026,4972.267,There will be three of these tables.,121,,
954,0.97,4972.267,4987.682,This first one is the financial plan that was included with the so this is essentially work that was completed in late 2019.,121,,
955,0.97,4987.682,4992.354,Prior to the pandemic.,121,,
956,0.97,4992.354,5002.33,"I just, kind of to provide context or how to read the table, I'll just walk through a couple of columns to show how it works.",121,,
957,0.97,5002.33,5008.269,"Because again, this will be the first of three of this type of table.",121,,
958,0.97,5008.269,5025.086,"Though, we will highlight during the presentation, the most important rows from our perspective, to look at, from the purposes of a balanced budget and also longer-term fiscal Sustainability.",121,,
959,0.97,5025.086,5030.892,"So beyond, in future slides or, in fact, probably in this slide, we'll Hone in on the key details.",121,,
960,0.97,5030.892,5035.063,But I just wanted to go real quick on how this works.,121,,
961,0.97,5035.063,5046.508,"So again, going back to some of the terms I defined earlier, we start with a fund balance in 2020 in this case.",121,,
962,0.97,5046.508,5051.346,Add in $1.4 billion of revenues.,121,,
963,0.97,5051.346,5068.329,"There was $1.5 billion of adopted expenditures, which was a gap of negative $19 million, bringing that original starting fund balance down to 59.6 million dollars.",121,,
964,0.97,5068.329,5080.308,"There were $59.6 or so million worth of reserves, but yet not specifically budgeted.",121,,
965,0.97,5080.308,5085.78,Bringing the unreserved balance or final fund balance to $13.,121,,
966,0.97,5085.78,5090.085,So represents the balanced budget for 2020.,121,,
967,0.97,5090.085,5091.286,Then moving into 2021.,121,,
968,0.97,5091.286,5099.427,The starting fund balance is the ending budgetary fund balance.,121,,
969,0.97,5099.427,5104.132,Not including the reserves.,121,,
970,0.97,5104.132,5108.136,And Nen adds $1.46 billion of revenue.,121,,
971,0.97,5108.136,5109.871,Against $1.5 billion of expenditures.,121,,
972,0.97,5109.871,5121.216,"So this is kind of the initial key Takeaway of this slide, is that based on the projections at that time.",121,,
973,0.97,5121.216,5121.583,So winter 2019.,121,,
974,0.97,5121.583,5127.755,The 2021 projection was showing a gap of negative $41 million.,121,,
975,0.97,5127.755,5133.127,And based on the various assumptions that were being applied at that time.,121,,
976,0.97,5133.127,5141.569,"That gap was shown to persist in future years, showing about a $36 million gap in 2023.",121,,
977,0.97,5141.569,5143.505,"And then, you know.",121,,
978,0.97,5143.505,5145.974,So that's the sort of Longer- term Sustainability.,121,,
979,0.97,5145.974,5153.448,"And each one of those gaps, then, brings the projected ending fund balance down in the plan.",121,,
980,0.97,5153.448,5164.926,"So the, given those negative operating gaps per year, the ending balance would have been negative 41 and then grow into negative 79.",121,,
981,0.97,5164.926,5175.069,"And then Finally, at the end of 2023, so at the end of this plan, it would have been showing that negative, or did show a negative $116 million in the general fund.",121,,
982,0.97,5175.069,5182.21,"So this is just to show that again, based on a lot of that.",121,,
983,0.97,5182.21,5187.916,A lot of imperfect but best availability information at the time.,121,,
984,0.97,5187.916,5199.227,"When 2020 budget was adopted, it was projecting an operating gap of around $39 million.",121,,
985,0.97,5199.227,5203.064,And final ending balance of $116 million.,121,,
986,0.97,5203.064,5213.575,"So that's important context to start off, because as we know, we will see what happens after, not after but based on changes from the pandemic.",121,,
987,0.97,5213.575,5231.192,"So whether or not these projections came true or not, it's uncertain because a lot of the assumptions change and what we have to plan",121,,
988,0.97,5232.727,5236.197,Known at least in 2019.,122,,
989,0.97,5236.197,5249.344,"And so, your side talks about here the 2020 adoptive budget, any reminder also as well, it is Deliberated in the fall prior.",122,,
990,0.97,5249.344,5256.251,So this is the 2019 actions that were taken before I was budget chair as well.,122,,
991,0.97,5256.251,5261.289,"But I think it has the next six months would then show us, after the budget was then adopted the pandemic it.",122,,
992,0.97,5261.289,5283.811,"So having this as a baseline understanding for the situation we were headed into, prior to the upheaval in the market and population health and health of local economy, it is important to show this is the starting point Pre-Covid and then we have factors to account for in the upcoming years.",122,,
993,0.97,5283.811,5288.349,So when you see the adult of budget liberated and discussed in 20 night teen.,122,,
994,0.97,5288.349,5291.452,Okay.,122,,
995,0.97,5291.452,5292.287,-- 2019.,122,,
996,0.97,5292.287,5293.821,Okay.,122,,
997,0.97,5293.821,5294.989,Thank you.,122,,
998,0.97,5294.989,5303.297,"And just to go back, that was Referencing page 4, with the memo.",123,,
999,0.97,5303.297,5309.37,"I will do better in Referencing back to a lot of the underlying detail, because I have notes to do that.",123,,
1000,0.97,5309.37,5323.251,"So moving to the next slide, if we could, we will show, and this is kind of, you know, followed on by what I just said, page 5 of the detailed memo.",123,,
1001,0.97,5323.251,5334.062,This financial plan shows the most recent financial plan included in the 2022 adoptive budget book.,123,,
1002,0.97,5334.062,5345.64,"This is, these are the numbers that you will see looking at the independent records from the chair.",123,,
1003,0.97,5345.64,5352.68,It shows how things have changed and we will go into those Takeaways and some further comments.,123,,
1004,0.97,5352.68,5359.787,But I just want to point out a point of consideration when looking at some of these numbers.,123,,
1005,0.97,5359.787,5367.228,"I will reference point in this table, and there is a reason why I am Referencing those.",123,,
1006,0.97,5367.228,5373.134,"First is, I believe the chair mentioned our budget process.",123,,
1007,0.97,5373.134,5389.25,"Rc W 32, 30 5A, adopt a budget for the next fiscal year, balancing resources with adopting appropriated expenditures.",123,,
1008,0.97,5389.25,5402.396,"So that is the state law, so that requires that at the end of the projection of the budget adopted for 2023 will balance to the bottom number in the table.",123,,
1009,0.97,5402.396,5408.903,Basically make the bottom number in 2023 essentially zero.,123,,
1010,0.97,5408.903,5412.273,That is the state legal requirement.,123,,
1011,0.97,5412.273,5428.556,"Resolution 28, 2885, the 1994 puts in place a modified biannual budget process that the city of Seattle has traditionally budgeted according to.",123,,
1012,0.97,5428.556,5455.216,"There was a temporary stay or hold on the process during the pandemic given the uncertainty go current process for the current fall would not only adopt under the legal state requirement and the adopted budget for 2023, but also endorse a financial plan or budget for 2024.",123,,
1013,0.97,5455.216,5456.851,That would provide the same level of balance.,123,,
1014,0.97,5456.851,5465.993,"I want to point that out because the numbers that I will reference will be largely the 2023 and 2024 numbers, with regards to the ending balance.",123,,
1015,0.97,5465.993,5478.272,Is those are the ones that the executive and city council will be considering as balanced for the upcoming budget.,123,,
1016,0.97,5478.272,5490.351,"So I just want to focus now, again, as I mentioned we will focus and key in on the most important numbers on the tables.",123,,
1017,0.97,5490.351,5502.396,"And this is a key one, which is the projected operating gap based on the adopted budget and assumption that are applied in the plan at this time.",123,,
1018,0.97,5502.396,5505.266,And this will be a familiar number.,123,,
1019,0.97,5505.266,5518.246,"Right now there is approximately 100, well, at the time of the budget adoption there was approximately $146 million projected gap in 2023.",123,,
1020,0.97,5518.246,5522.316,And a similar number projected for 2024.,123,,
1021,0.97,5522.316,5535.263,"Once again, meaning that the projected revenues were $146 million less than the projected expenditures in each of those years.",123,,
1022,0.97,5535.263,5555.85,"And then drawing from the starting balance, the county for the gap in each one of those years means that the ending fund balance would be projected to be $144 million negative in 2023, growing to -290 million in 2024.",123,,
1023,0.97,5555.85,5572.066,"Again those are the numbers that the budget would be expected to balance to and that should be probably a familiar number, at the earlier stage in the year, in terms of the financial situation with the general fund of.",123,,
1024,0.97,5572.066,5578.005,Looking at the next budget cycle.,123,,
1025,0.97,5578.005,5600.161,"And largely the reason why this gap exists is accommodation of three factors, one, the 2020 budget, adoptive budget financial plan shown, we had a Pre-Existing condition of a 39 or so million dollar operating gap.",123,,
1026,0.97,5600.161,5621.315,"The Covid pandemic, it hit the world and the city and the struggles and challenges, some of which have recovered but not all recovered to Pre-Pandemic level, we do not have the same production that we were seeing in 2020.",123,,
1027,0.97,5621.315,5631.792,"And in recent budgets those gaps have been solved, the most recent budget, the gaps have been solved by use of one time revenues.",123,,
1028,0.97,5631.792,5637.064,And the future of those one time revenues are not available for use.,123,,
1029,0.97,5637.064,5643.304,And so now I will go to the third table.,123,,
1030,0.97,5643.304,5646.841,"So the third financial plan, actually I will talk some changes.",123,,
1031,0.97,5646.841,5648.275,It is important.,123,,
1032,0.97,5648.275,5655.549,Because the numbers as you will see have shifted in a good direction and there is a number of reasons for that.,123,,
1033,0.97,5655.549,5666.994,"So really I am focusing on what happened in the 2021, so originally there was a production of what 2021 would look like.",123,,
1034,0.97,5666.994,5676.337,"Department of finance and administrative service of staff, having done the work to assess how much is left over from 2021.",123,,
1035,0.97,5676.337,5695.99,"So how expenditures appear compared to estimates, and how much money is carried forward in the future years, and we assess what resources kind of increase the fund balance starting for 2022.",123,,
1036,0.97,5695.99,5712.707,"So has heard by the housing Committee, that is April 20th presentation, the general fund came in at 33 1/2 million dollars above revised estimates.",123,,
1037,0.97,5712.707,5716.777,"So that is a good thing and adds money, one-time resources available for 2022.",123,,
1038,0.97,5716.777,5725.186,"An even larger number, $231 million, of the difference between the budget is expenditures and Actuals.",123,,
1039,0.97,5725.186,5732.827,This means the city spent $231 million less than what was projected in 2021.,123,,
1040,0.97,5732.827,5750.311,"That there are a number of reasons for that, part of it is that prior obligations, commitments, that are either legal or contractual in nature, or Council priorities were not fully completed in 2021.",123,,
1041,0.97,5750.311,5752.413,Though the intent is to complete those.,123,,
1042,0.97,5752.413,5761.555,So these will be covered in an upcoming Council bill.,123,,
1043,0.97,5761.555,5767.461,"Council bill 1020306, which will be with the next meeting on May 17th.",123,,
1044,0.97,5767.461,5772.6,It will detail this information for you.,123,,
1045,0.97,5772.6,5781.942,"But for the purposes of the plan, what we have done is send a portion of the money that is available at the end of 2021 is going to be carried over into 2022.",123,,
1046,0.97,5781.942,5804.899,"And there is a few different types of carryforwards, automatic ones that have specifically prior approval by Council to carry into two years, and then legislative ones that are part of the bill that I Referenced, that will be submitted at it request to carry forward.",123,,
1047,0.97,5804.899,5809.77,Then there is additional grant revenue that is anticipated that offsets a portion of that money.,123,,
1048,0.97,5809.77,5828.389,"But at the end of the day $134 million of that money nets out, the money, the resources that would transfer from 2021 to 2022.",123,,
1049,0.97,5828.389,5834.795,The good news is there is still a positive to gain in starting the fund balance of $120 million based on 2021 financial results.,123,,
1050,0.97,5834.795,5852.146,"And in the next slide I believe I will cover some portion of that, how it will be used or is proposed to be used to replenish the city's revenue stabilization fund.",123,,
1051,0.97,5856.55,5864.291,So just a quick Recap on the stabilization fund.,124,,
1052,0.97,5864.291,5865.359,Sorry.,124,,
1053,0.97,5865.359,5876.203,I need to turn my lights back on.,124,,
1054,0.97,5876.203,5882.343,"So at the end of 2021, again this is pages 6 through 7 of the memo with more detailed discussion of this.",124,,
1055,0.97,5882.343,5893.621,"At the end of 2021, two uses of the emergency Fund and the stabilization Fund, there was a combined balance of about 39 million dollars.",124,,
1056,0.97,5893.621,5900.294,"And this was, uses of those fiscal reserves to address challenges from Covid pandemic.",124,,
1057,0.97,5900.294,5912.606,"Prior to the start, prior to the 2020 process, there was about $127 million that funded those reserves.",124,,
1058,0.97,5912.606,5920.014,"However, given the uses, the adopted budget included some Paybacks.",124,,
1059,0.97,5920.014,5932.192,"So it was the recognition of that, the need for use in the reserves no longer existed and now the city could be begin to process those levels.",124,,
1060,0.97,5932.192,5945.706,"The adoptive plan, adoptive financial plan for 2022 included basically the assumptions that are included in the 2022 adopted budget.",124,,
1061,0.97,5945.706,5957.518,"So the resolution 32024, temporarily or permanently changed the emergency fund replenishment.",124,,
1062,0.97,5957.518,5964.958,"Prior to that change it would have been anticipated that the city would have fully replenish the emergency Fund, which was on the order of $60 million to the original levels after use.",124,,
1063,0.97,5964.958,5974.568,"The change through the resolution 32024, instead put in place a five-year replenishment Timeline.",124,,
1064,0.97,5974.568,5982.476,It did not specifically imply white the timing or the amounts or for each particular year.,124,,
1065,0.97,5982.476,5992.286,However the financial plan and adoptive budget reasonably included $10 million per year.,124,,
1066,0.97,5992.286,5997.825,Which continues the amount in the 2022 adoptive budget in the future years.,124,,
1067,0.97,5997.825,6001.662,So there would be a total of $40 million added back to the emergency Fund.,124,,
1068,0.97,6001.662,6006.667,Revenue stabilization has a different policy.,124,,
1069,0.97,6006.667,6010.204,It is based on annual projected revenue collections.,124,,
1070,0.97,6010.204,6020.981,"However the adopted budget included the amount of $15.4 million, higher than what was strictly required by the policy.",124,,
1071,0.97,6020.981,6028.288,"However, it was the Council's decision to put more in the revenue stabilization fund than was required.",124,,
1072,0.97,6028.288,6041.435,"The adoptive budget financial plan continued the assumption, $15.4 million per year, which would put $61.2 million into the revenue stabilization fund through 2025.",124,,
1073,0.97,6041.435,6060.854,The memo on page 6 talks about how these planned contributions would have replenished each of the fiscal Brassieres back to policy levels as stated in the fiscal policy.,124,,
1074,0.97,6060.854,6067.795,The emergency fund would have been on the order of 93% of what the policy level would have been at 2025.,124,,
1075,0.97,6067.795,6074.768,And the stabilization fund would be at 97Th percent based on this plan of replenishment.,124,,
1076,0.97,6074.768,6100.194,"Okay, with that things have changed and the key and notable change is that given the level of resources available at the end of 2021, there is the existing fiscal policy for the revenue stabilization Fund, a requirement that 50% of unreserved balances at year-end be deposited to the revenue stabilization fund.",124,,
1077,0.97,6100.194,6109.837,"Based on calculations for CP Oh, would be about $30 million.",124,,
1078,0.97,6109.837,6124.151,"There are different layers of good news in the presentation but by way of really good news, this deposit would fully deposit the revenue stabilization fund in 2022, essentially many years ahead of the plan.",124,,
1079,0.97,6124.151,6145.572,"Then at that time future contributions to the revenue stabilization Fund, which would be deposited to the revenue stabilization fund to keep up with growth and revenue.",124,,
1080,0.97,6145.572,6153.78,That actual change in the fiscal policy requires appropriation from city council.,124,,
1081,0.97,6153.78,6170.297,"We made the assumption in these planning, the revised plan that we will share with you shortly, at the decision that we will anticipate will be part of the supplemental, which we have yet to receive but will receive in coming years.",124,,
1082,0.97,6170.297,6183.443,"It will include a transfer of that amount of money to the revenue stabilization Fund, fully replenishment to the policy.",124,,
1083,0.97,6183.443,6194.421,"Next, another, more in the vein of projection changes, changes in assumptions for the future.",124,,
1084,0.97,6194.421,6195.889,This specifically is inflation.,124,,
1085,0.97,6195.889,6216.376,"So if you Harken back to the presentation from CBO and Oerf about revenue update on April 20th, there was also significant impacts with cost increases through inflation have had an projected had on city expenditure lines.",124,,
1086,0.97,6216.376,6227.988,So the information that draws and is more detailed on pages 10 and 11 of the memo shows how the inflation expectations have changed in the financial plan.,124,,
1087,0.97,6227.988,6255.382,"So this is coming from the forecast office, and after they updated what their numbers are, these show that in 2023 and 2024 there are .8% higher inflation in each year, then was anticipated when the adopted budget financial plan was generated.",124,,
1088,0.97,6255.382,6259.853,So that is fairly moderate but still an increase in the assumption of those years.,124,,
1089,0.97,6259.853,6271.398,What is more acute is that as you read in the press and see in the numbers is that inflation is really much higher in the current year.,124,,
1090,0.97,6271.398,6279.706,"So right now, than it was originally anticipated to be.",124,,
1091,0.97,6279.706,6301.595,"The table at the lower paid part of the slide shows that the inflation expectation at the time of the budget was on the order of 3.2%, the April forecast number suggested that inflation has been in fact closer to 7%, which is a 3.8% increase.",124,,
1092,0.97,6301.595,6310.437,"So for the verses of building that into the plan, to allow for the fact that costs are higher, that 3.8% has been added to the 23 projection.",124,,
1093,0.97,6310.437,6319.78,The 2022 number is the current adopted budget number with some specific legislative revisions included.,124,,
1094,0.97,6319.78,6330.39,"So I did not feel comfortable adding it to the 2022, to inflate with that 2022 expectation in this plan would be.",124,,
1095,0.97,6330.39,6337.597,"Though, you know, that number, if the cost increases are higher, there could certainly be a supplemental change that is requested.",124,,
1096,0.97,6337.597,6338.332,It is entirely possible.,124,,
1097,0.97,6338.332,6346.139,"For purposes of the planning that we are discussing today, the higher planning has been built into 2023.",124,,
1098,0.97,6346.139,6353.28,"And then to go into the weeds about inflation, it largely affects labor costs, I.T.",124,,
1099,0.97,6353.28,6370.931,"Costs, facilities and in the model, in the economy in general, those are the areas where we are buying services from external providers and we are still at the whims of how the cost increases are funneling through the economy.",124,,
1100,0.97,6370.931,6381.108,And also to point out that inflation is not an equivalent adjustment to both the revenues and expenditures in the model.,124,,
1101,0.97,6381.108,6399.092,"It is something that underlies and permeates through projections of both but it is not just as easy as saying, we add 1.3, for example, in 2024 to both lines, to both revenues and expenditures.",124,,
1102,0.97,6399.092,6399.793,It is more complicated.,124,,
1103,0.97,6399.793,6408.935,"If you think about revenues, looking at something like sales tax, there are some goods and services in the economy that are not subject to sales tax like gas, gasoline.",124,,
1104,0.97,6408.935,6411.404,And food.,124,,
1105,0.97,6411.404,6423.45,"And the cost are going up in those items, that leaves less discretionary for people to buy the items that would be subject to the tax.",124,,
1106,0.97,6423.45,6429.589,"So just even, there are certainly many more examples of how inflation differs in affects the economy in different ways.",124,,
1107,0.97,6429.589,6440.4,"Though in general it is not viewed as a positive, given the high levels in 2022.",124,,
1108,0.97,6440.4,6445.505,Dr. Aly Pennucci?,125,,
1109,0.97,6445.505,6461.555,"I would add in that what Tom is going over, informing the financial plan, I also want to point back to comments I think both director Dingley, chair Mosqueda and Tom had made about the dynamic nature of these numbers.",126,,
1110,0.97,6461.555,6473.266,And that CBO is right now in the process of looking at the baseline expenditures and what the projected increases may be due to inflation and other operational needs.,126,,
1111,0.97,6473.266,6490.65,"So I just want to say again as we are about to show the revised financial plan, this is a point of time where we may be Underestimating the growth and baseline expenditures in the financial plan.",126,,
1112,0.97,6490.65,6494.387,Tom did include some adjustments to try to account for some of the anticipated growth.,126,,
1113,0.97,6494.387,6514.841,"But because CBO is in the middle of the process, we do not know what the actual numbers will be in the numbers will continue to evolve and we may come back in August and show greater increases and expected Pretenders projected expenditures for 23 and 24.",126,,
1114,0.97,6514.841,6518.278,A good reminder.,127,,
1115,0.97,6518.278,6518.879,Thank you so much.,127,,
1116,0.97,6518.879,6520.981,"Dr. Dingley, please.",127,,
1117,0.97,6520.981,6526.72,Thank you so much interim director Aly Pennucci.,128,,
1118,0.97,6526.72,6559.819,"I recognize the question or comment, in addition to the inflation cost, there are a number of pressures and we can get into this in the next slide too, but there are a number of pressures on expenditures, inflation and disruption to Supply-Chain, impact of the war in Ukraine, and delays due to the concrete strike, a tight labor market, all put pressure on the costs that the city bears and the timing of--et cetera.",128,,
1119,0.97,6559.819,6564.124,We will get more into that but I wanted to put it out there as well.,128,,
1120,0.97,6564.124,6565.125,Thank you so much.,129,,
1121,0.97,6565.125,6571.731,"I will read from page 10 here, I think it underscores all this points.",129,,
1122,0.97,6571.731,6577.871,"Other considerations outside of inflation, Midway on page 10, second paragraph.",129,,
1123,0.97,6577.871,6589.316,"Include but not limited to employment and population trends, wage growth, business the other composition and consumer preferences that will impact growth and each will be differently impacted by inflation or forces.",129,,
1124,0.97,6589.316,6595.488,That is true on the city expenditure side.,129,,
1125,0.97,6595.488,6605.031,And then that is also true for like our spending and what we are trying to deliver to the city as well.,129,,
1126,0.97,6605.031,6624.284,"I am trying to emphasize your point director Dingley, that this is going to have maybe a compounding effect once we have seen what inflation is as a Standalone and how the other factors come on board.",129,,
1127,0.97,6624.284,6629.489,Any additional comments or questions on that before we move to the big sort of Forward- looking slides?,129,,
1128,0.97,6629.489,6630.523,All right.,129,,
1129,0.97,6633.793,6650.877,"Thank you offer added comments, because if the Kia point is that this is the projection, and it is the best available data and it will certainly change.",130,,
1130,0.97,6650.877,6652.979,We will certainly look at these numbers in the future.,130,,
1131,0.97,6652.979,6657.05,"So let's look at how this at least based on assumptions, how the numbers have changed.",130,,
1132,0.97,6657.05,6674.267,"So this is the most recent work that has been done, in collaboration with CBO and how projections of changed given a number of factors even that I discussed in the previous slide.",130,,
1133,0.97,6674.267,6681.074,"Both the added benefit of higher fund balance, and the 2022 revised projection.",130,,
1134,0.97,6681.074,6699.325,"If you look in the revised column you will see the thought would be $8 million of balance, and now given the positive financial results, there is $273 million in starting balances.",130,,
1135,0.97,6699.325,6706.466,"And then also the revenue forecast update has added, received in April, added about $35 million of resources per year.",130,,
1136,0.97,6706.466,6709.335,To the projection.,130,,
1137,0.97,6709.335,6724.284,"Also the planned or potential change in how the reserves are replenished given the amount of available to replenish the revenue stabilization Fund, reverses the planned amount in a few years.",130,,
1138,0.97,6724.284,6728.822,"But really, to just focus if we could on the bottom line.",130,,
1139,0.97,6728.822,6730.824,"The numbers, the key numbers of this table.",130,,
1140,0.97,6730.824,6756.316,"It is to focus on the operating gap amount and so the 22 number, I will say it right off the bat, it is including the decisions that I discussed previously which are the potential decisions, essentially the legislative carryforwards and the replenishment of the fiscal reserves.",130,,
1141,0.97,6756.316,6760.82,And that uses the large portion overall.,130,,
1142,0.97,6760.82,6768.161,It is all funded from the starting balance.,130,,
1143,0.97,6768.161,6776.169,So which is kind of shows about the deficit at the table but I assure you it is not a deficit in the 2022 budget plan.,130,,
1144,0.97,6776.169,6786.88,"However, 2023 and beyond, these are projections based on the kind of not one time but more ongoing items.",130,,
1145,0.97,6786.88,6801.027,"And then a Sliver of good news is that the operating gap has, based on the projections, declined to 117 million in 2023 and $107 million in 2024.",130,,
1146,0.97,6801.027,6813.84,"And then further the ending fund balance, at the end of 2023, the legally adopted budget year, the ending fund balance projection is now declining to $35 million.",130,,
1147,0.97,6813.84,6822.482,"And at the end of 2024, which would be the endorsed year, it has declined and basically gone down by more than half.",130,,
1148,0.97,6822.482,6833.059,"It went from $290 million negative, in the adopted financial plan, to $142 million in this revised plan.",130,,
1149,0.97,6833.059,6847.307,And again this is based on a whole layered set of assumptions that we are making and are certain to change both with the revenue forecast information and updates through the baseline profit that the director discussed.,130,,
1150,0.97,6847.307,6857.483,Let's take an additional clarifying comment from director Aly Pennucci and then questions from Council members.,131,,
1151,0.97,6857.483,6858.284,Go ahead.,131,,
1152,0.97,6858.284,6859.018,Thank you.,132,,
1153,0.97,6859.018,6884.577,"I want to point out that it is modestly good news to see the projected number in 2023, sort of the ending fund balance of -35 million, and I just want to highlight this is relying on one-time funds to support Bay city services' ongoing expenditures.",132,,
1154,0.97,6884.577,6888.281,It is also assuming that in 2023 and beyond that there is no news new spending.,132,,
1155,0.97,6888.281,6910.67,"So any of the one-time expenditures that are regularly included in the proposed and adopted budgets, as well as any new or expanded programs or services could not be accommodated or not assumed to be accommodated in the expenditures in 2023 and beyond.",132,,
1156,0.97,6910.67,6927.02,"I just wanted to highlight that point as it restricts sort of options available to the city, in terms of resources available to address, you know, issues in the community.",132,,
1157,0.97,6927.02,6931.124,Additional clarifying comment and then we will go to Councilmember Nelson.,133,,
1158,0.97,6931.124,6931.724,Thank you.,134,,
1159,0.97,6931.724,6945.471,"To add to director Aly Pennucci's point, this does not assume room for new growing or unexpected needs.",134,,
1160,0.97,6945.471,6946.005,I think the I.T.,134,,
1161,0.97,6946.005,6958.518,"Project, that for whatever reason is running overtime, not pick on I.T., or just some judgment in claims item, that comes out of the blue, those are not accounted for here either.",134,,
1162,0.97,6958.518,6968.461,"So there is no buffer here to absorb those unexpected, in addition to new items.",134,,
1163,0.97,6968.461,6969.128,Thank you.,135,,
1164,0.97,6969.128,6979.105,And I will just add that it assumes the same level of spending on certain items that we perceive to be ongoing.,135,,
1165,0.97,6979.105,6981.174,So there is a conversation to be had there.,135,,
1166,0.97,6981.174,6986.079,And also as you can tell does not yet assumed additional revenue streams.,135,,
1167,0.97,6986.079,6986.879,That is for conversation.,135,,
1168,0.97,6986.879,6994.654,But I want to make sure that folks understand the base being shown there is the existing expenditures without additional new revenue.,135,,
1169,0.97,6994.654,7004.197,Both of which I think we will have more conversations about.,135,,
1170,0.97,7004.197,7006.899,"Director Pennucci, before I go to Councilmember Nelson, anything carrying over with a hand?",135,,
1171,0.97,7006.899,7007.166,Okay.,135,,
1172,0.97,7007.166,7007.433,Great.,135,,
1173,0.97,7007.433,7009.769,"Councilmember Nelson, thank you for your patience, go ahead please.",135,,
1174,0.97,7009.769,7010.169,Thank you.,136,,
1175,0.97,7010.169,7013.873,"And you highlight the revenues line, please?",136,,
1176,0.97,7013.873,7014.44,That is fine.,136,,
1177,0.97,7014.44,7014.841,Sorry.,137,,
1178,0.97,7014.841,7017.543,I do not have a highlight --,137,,
1179,0.97,7017.543,7019.145,That is fine just like it is.,138,,
1180,0.97,7019.145,7037.83,"On April 20th the revised 2022 revenues were 1 billion 671 million and now here it is 1,708,000,000.",138,,
1181,0.97,7037.83,7043.336,Which is the revised 2022 revenue.,138,,
1182,0.97,7043.336,7047.874,"Which is not a lot compared with all those Zeroes, it looks like about 30 million.",138,,
1183,0.97,7047.874,7049.509,Did something happen in the past couple weeks?,138,,
1184,0.97,7049.509,7061.754,"And first let me preface, not Prefacing but I really should, I really do appreciate the planning approach.",138,,
1185,0.97,7061.754,7071.197,But as we continue can we just expect that the projected revenues for 2022 will keep changing as we go forward?,138,,
1186,0.97,7071.197,7076.135,I will make a quick comment and then ask for Tom to provide clarification on the number.,139,,
1187,0.97,7076.135,7090.683,Throughout 2020 and 2021 my effort has been to move to making sure that both the executive and the legislative branch got real time information on any revenue projections at the same moment.,139,,
1188,0.97,7090.683,7094.353,So we collectively worsening the information together.,139,,
1189,0.97,7094.353,7103.129,Just like they do in the state Legislature with the forecasts and projections there.,139,,
1190,0.97,7103.129,7104.063,That is still my commitment.,139,,
1191,0.97,7104.063,7109.435,The first time I saw revenue projections in April was the same times they were transmitted and posted on the economic revenue forecast.,139,,
1192,0.97,7109.435,7111.737,The Website.,139,,
1193,0.97,7111.737,7117.076,And the latter information came to us Electively from the CBO office.,139,,
1194,0.97,7117.076,7131.991,"In terms of what Council can expect from us, you can expect quarterly updates that will be resented in the same month of the forecast, presented by a forecast of the committee around the revenue projections.",139,,
1195,0.97,7131.991,7134.861,I just want to make sure we are still on the same page and plan.,139,,
1196,0.97,7134.861,7138.965,For having that shared information.,139,,
1197,0.97,7138.965,7146.939,Then I will turn to Tom to address the question of whether or not there has been any new information provided as we know there was a slight update from some sites presented in the last committee meeting.,139,,
1198,0.97,7146.939,7150.343,That might be accounting for some of them.,139,,
1199,0.97,7150.343,7153.646,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,140,,
1200,0.97,7153.646,7157.917,Thank you for the question Councilmember Nelson.,140,,
1201,0.97,7157.917,7161.02,That was actually noted on the table.,140,,
1202,0.97,7161.02,7166.792,And this is the additional $37 million of grants.,140,,
1203,0.97,7166.792,7169.428,These grants are associated with the decisions made in prior years.,140,,
1204,0.97,7169.428,7182.508,So basically they are carrying forward an expenditure assumption and in some cases there is additional revenue that we have not yet received but we expect to receive.,140,,
1205,0.97,7182.508,7191.784,So the April 20th forecast update did not include that $37 million grant.,140,,
1206,0.97,7191.784,7210.77,"But it is money we expect to receive, so for the purposes of this financial grant we have added it and we are actually working with the budget office and the forecast office to enhance how the budget monitor of revenues is done so this type of thing is built in the forecast so there is a One-On- one comparison of the two.",140,,
1207,0.97,7210.77,7219.345,By keep an eye on the number and discrepancy.,140,,
1208,0.97,7219.345,7221.047,Any additional comments or questions on this?,141,,
1209,0.97,7221.047,7221.314,Okay.,141,,
1210,0.97,7221.314,7221.814,Let's continue.,141,,
1211,0.97,7221.814,7222.248,Great.,142,,
1212,0.97,7222.248,7227.286,"And I believe we can now move to, so these are just some options.",142,,
1213,0.97,7227.286,7253.746,"So looking at these projected gaps and changes in the ending fund balance in the future, there are just kind of a few thought experiments that we had gone through to how a council could think about these strategies to address these deficits or gaps.",142,,
1214,0.97,7253.746,7269.862,There are probably more that we have not thought of that the ones that we have included for today are reducing the right size general fund budget to match expenditures.,142,,
1215,0.97,7269.862,7291.117,"And also on this one, this is more of the sensitivity analysis, the forecast Council endorsed the recommendation for the baseline for the current projections but there are other scenarios that are available based on the National data that we use for modeling.",142,,
1216,0.97,7291.117,7301.093,They are both optimistic and pessimistic . So we have shown how using those two looks at what the future could hold and how that impacts these numbers.,142,,
1217,0.97,7301.093,7307.466,"And then, you know, also there is ways restrictive fund policies could be changed.",142,,
1218,0.97,7307.466,7318.077,So to change how much the general fund is sending to the other funds or looking the other way and how the funds could be sent to the general funds.,142,,
1219,0.97,7318.077,7340.199,"We modeled the immense both longer-term and shorter-term approaches, given that if we could actually look back, it interim director Pennucci, a key point of this, again if we look at the operating gap row.",142,,
1220,0.97,7340.199,7343.669,"This is kind of, I mentioned not only the challenges but the opportunities.",142,,
1221,0.97,7343.669,7349.775,If you look at the gap it is $117 million in 2023.,142,,
1222,0.97,7349.775,7357.516,But it actually decreases to $69 million in 2025 and $37 million in 2026.,142,,
1223,0.97,7357.516,7374.166,"And one thought I have had about that is there are some revenues that have recovered to the pretest Pre-Pandemic, however other categories are lagging behind still.",142,,
1224,0.97,7374.166,7393.219,"I think that this trend shows that as the other categories recover more slowly, they start to impact the general fund financial plan and the gap in the future is smaller than the gap we are experiencing in the near-term.",142,,
1225,0.97,7393.219,7403.462,"This underlies the concept that there might be some Shorter- term strategies that can bridge the gap with a more, smaller structural change and some targeted one-time approaches.",142,,
1226,0.97,7403.462,7403.829,Great.,143,,
1227,0.97,7403.829,7404.33,Clarification edition.,143,,
1228,0.97,7404.33,7406.232,Please go ahead director Dingley.,143,,
1229,0.97,7406.232,7410.903,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,144,,
1230,0.97,7410.903,7426.786,"I also want to add in that what we do not see, Councilmember Herbold, at the April 20th meeting raised a good question about how we see inflation showing up in these expenditures? where are the expenditures flowing in?",144,,
1231,0.97,7426.786,7434.894,One area as well we have not talked about is our Labeler labor costs.,144,,
1232,0.97,7434.894,7441.434,"As you know we have multiple contracts open this year for negotiation and those are, the outcome is uncertain.",144,,
1233,0.97,7441.434,7448.541,And so as it is sort of a Zero- sum game at the end of the day.,144,,
1234,0.97,7448.541,7453.913,So that added and with inflation another things coming in.,144,,
1235,0.97,7453.913,7465.357,"I also wanted to highlight that what Tom has shown you so far is, this is what I came to all of you early this year to start this conversation.",144,,
1236,0.97,7465.357,7470.462,And so again I just want to say thank you for being engaged and excited for having the Scomber.,144,,
1237,0.97,7470.462,7473.699,For having this conversation.,144,,
1238,0.97,7473.699,7475.167,This is warming my heart.,144,,
1239,0.97,7475.167,7483.142,"Because this is the problem to solve, it is highlighted as Tom just highlighted.",144,,
1240,0.97,7483.142,7496.288,"We are Bowie, as far as the hiring freeze in the Department Ramping back up but this is the real problem to solve before us.",144,,
1241,0.97,7496.288,7499.892,"Vice chair Herbold, please go ahead.",145,,
1242,0.97,7499.892,7500.96,Thank you so much.,146,,
1243,0.97,7500.96,7536.328,"As it relates to the slide that identifies long-term and near-term Sustainability strategies, the concept of temporary changes to restrictive fund policies and restrictive fund balance, do we have a catalog of all the existing restrict div fund policies that we could take a look at and see whether or not there are some we want to consider temporary change, and others that we don't?",146,,
1244,0.97,7536.328,7537.563,"I will take that, Tom.",147,,
1245,0.97,7537.563,7543.769,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,147,,
1246,0.97,7543.769,7556.248,"I do not have readily a catalog but if we could look at all of the funds that we often refer to as general fund adjacent, which is policies that the Council has the authority to modify and provide that to the committee.",147,,
1247,0.97,7556.248,7566.659,But it includes things like the point Tom brought up in the terms that there is a policy around transferring funds to the revenue stabilization fund.,147,,
1248,0.97,7566.659,7568.661,That is one example.,147,,
1249,0.97,7568.661,7575.301,I encourage you all to replenish that.,147,,
1250,0.97,7575.301,7587.947,"Challenges that the city may face down the road, that is the tape type of policy that we would look at including as well as those types of policies.",147,,
1251,0.97,7587.947,7592.251,We are happy to put that together for your review.,147,,
1252,0.97,7592.251,7593.319,"Great, that is appreciated.",148,,
1253,0.97,7593.319,7597.189,Please go ahead Councilmember Pedersen.,148,,
1254,0.97,7597.189,7599.558,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,149,,
1255,0.97,7599.558,7612.271,"And really happy that chair Mosqueda, you have asked for this level of detail to be presented so early in the budgeting process.",149,,
1256,0.97,7612.271,7621.113,"And you know, anytime we can lift up in Appendix and daylight it like this, I love it, I have got my Spreadsheets, I love them.",149,,
1257,0.97,7621.113,7623.115,Ready to go here.,149,,
1258,0.97,7623.115,7630.756,"I just wanted to, and I appreciate budget director Dingley mentioning the labor cost issue.",149,,
1259,0.97,7630.756,7647.973,"A lot of us are on the labor policy, so having these numbers now is real vital information for us to have, as far as where the gaps are.",149,,
1260,0.97,7647.973,7653.045,"I just wanted to say, you know, we worked really hard on the 2022 budget that we are in right now.",149,,
1261,0.97,7653.045,7663.655,And so I do not favor cutting things that we already promised to our constituents for this calendar year.,149,,
1262,0.97,7663.655,7670.329,I do support Replenishing our emergency Fund and revenue stabilization fund as based on our current policy.,149,,
1263,0.97,7670.329,7674.266,And it looks like that will be possible to do.,149,,
1264,0.97,7674.266,7686.345,"I recognize there is still a gap of that 35 million dollars for 2023, and then gaps in 2024 and 2025.",149,,
1265,0.97,7686.345,7696.555,So I would really appreciate the strategies being put forward to consider options.,149,,
1266,0.97,7696.555,7702.094,And I will mention an option that may not be popular with everybody but I wanted to get more information about that.,149,,
1267,0.97,7702.094,7731.69,"When I look at the adopted 2022 budget document that was put Online recently, there is in the Appendix, on page 783, it does talk about the payroll tax, Jumpstart tax that Councilmember Mosqueda and others were champions of that tax and Thankfully that is helping us, helped us to deal with a gap last year.",149,,
1268,0.97,7731.69,7733.926,It is coming in higher than expected numbers.,149,,
1269,0.97,7733.926,7737.362,"And in that Appendix, page 73.",149,,
1270,0.97,7737.362,7751.443,"It says to start tax projected at 250 million, now projected about 296 million.",149,,
1271,0.97,7751.443,7754.313,So I just wanted to see what it might look like with different strategies.,149,,
1272,0.97,7754.313,7761.52,"We obviously all approved the investment plan for Jumpstart as things that we really need, things that we support.",149,,
1273,0.97,7761.52,7772.598,And I am just wondering however if that could be on the table as an option.,149,,
1274,0.97,7772.598,7788.647,"So asking central staff if they could sort of look into what would different Snares look like so you are still investing the vast majority of the Jumpstart funds, on what was the percentages that were agreed to.",149,,
1275,0.97,7788.647,7803.862,"But also, investing some of the greater than anticipated revenue from that source to help deal with the general fund gap.",149,,
1276,0.97,7803.862,7818.544,"Of course that is all subject to whether we are able to manage our costs elsewhere or whether that is labor contracts, which I believe makes up between 60% and 70% of General funds, personal costs, I believe.",149,,
1277,0.97,7818.544,7832.758,"But anyway just asking, they have already given us so much information and it would be helpful to look at what options might be available looking at the Jumpstart revenue.",149,,
1278,0.97,7832.758,7834.493,Again just portions of it on a temporary basis.,149,,
1279,0.97,7834.493,7842.034,"I know that there may not be consensus for that, but just getting that information going would be helpful to me, at least.",149,,
1280,0.97,7842.034,7855.48,"Councilmember Pedersen, you are right, that is not an easy topic to broach, one that I feel a lot of excitement that we had unanimous support for the spend plan.",150,,
1281,0.97,7855.48,7859.418,Umana Ms. passage.,150,,
1282,0.97,7859.418,7871.063,"I am glad you asked the question to central staff and Councilmember's, Councilmember Herbold's, the general adjacent fund too.",150,,
1283,0.97,7871.063,7873.165,I am sure it is part of the analysis.,150,,
1284,0.97,7873.165,7883.675,And also appreciate that there is a broad coalition who had worked really hard with all of us on those details of this amendment.,150,,
1285,0.97,7883.675,7885.043,So more conversation to come about that.,150,,
1286,0.97,7885.043,7886.044,I appreciate you raising that.,150,,
1287,0.97,7886.044,7896.021,And I do have one question Councilmember Herbold that maybe I will throw out and we can come to add your comment as well.,150,,
1288,0.97,7896.021,7901.36,"Tom, I am wondering if you could spend a little bit more time as well talking about the right size and concept here.",150,,
1289,0.97,7901.36,7916.808,"Obviously the word choice is important, we want to make sure that we are avoiding unnecessary budgeting, given the data and expense at the beginning of this meeting.",150,,
1290,0.97,7916.808,7930.255,Which showed that jurisdiction to invested in core government services show faster rebound in economies that benefited both driving and public sector.,150,,
1291,0.97,7930.255,7939.598,Wondering if you talk about how you saw a 3.6% Underuse of spends.,150,,
1292,0.97,7939.598,7945.404,And how the Rightsizing could potentially be calculated.,150,,
1293,0.97,7945.404,7949.841,Happy to do so chair Mosqueda.,151,,
1294,0.97,7949.841,7964.289,First I will confirm Councilmember Pedersen had the estimate of the personal costs of the plan and I confirm it is 59% projection for personnel related costs.,151,,
1295,0.97,7964.289,7978.47,"And then to chair Mosqueda's question, probably useful to look at the next slide because we will actually see the numbers.",151,,
1296,0.97,7978.47,7983.208,And on page 8 of the memo there is the calculation that the chair Referenced.,151,,
1297,0.97,7983.208,7999.157,"And this looks at 2021 actual results, which I discussed in the earlier slide, which resulted in revenues above budget and significant amount of expenditures below budget.",151,,
1298,0.97,7999.157,8015.507,"You can see the calculation on page 8. but the punchline is even after the county puts forward the general fund expenditure, the Actuals in 2021 were 3.5% lower than what was budgeted, about $50 million in the year.",151,,
1299,0.97,8015.507,8037.796,"And so just by way of a thought experiment, again this is kind of taking a broad metric and applying it to the plan, the underlying process by which these numbers would result, would require a targeted approach looking at vacancies in the various ways that they were generated.",151,,
1300,0.97,8037.796,8067.059,"If we resolved--in the plan, that would cut out--million a year and revise the gap to $67 million in 2023 and $56 million in 2024, which would then balance the unreserved balance for 2023, so there would be a net $14 million remaining.",151,,
1301,0.97,8067.059,8071.797,"However, the 2024 projection would still be $42 million negative.",151,,
1302,0.97,8071.797,8076.001,For the ending balance.,151,,
1303,0.97,8076.001,8081.339,"Again this is just a thought experiment, just one approach, one piece of an approach that can be taken.",151,,
1304,0.97,8081.339,8083.442,And showing how a 3% reduction can look.,151,,
1305,0.97,8083.442,8088.68,Additional clarification director Dingley.,152,,
1306,0.97,8088.68,8089.848,"Yes, thank you.",153,,
1307,0.97,8089.848,8105.464,"One thing I want to point out is that Tom has done a Herculean job of taking information from our office and largely re-creating things that we have systems that feed into this, many link's, Spreadsheets, he had to do this based on several incoming points.",153,,
1308,0.97,8105.464,8106.798,"Job well done, Tom.",153,,
1309,0.97,8106.798,8119.044,"As Tom noted the base financial plan he is sharing Inflates I.T., fleets, and facilities costs, not necessarily all costs.",153,,
1310,0.97,8119.044,8130.255,So the number here on the expenditures is likely based on what I have been seeing over the last month and reviewing Department preliminary for the budget.,153,,
1311,0.97,8130.255,8135.56,Is likely Undercounting by about half on the expenditure side.,153,,
1312,0.97,8135.56,8149.274,"So instead of a 3%, what we have been seeing is believing to close the gap of around 6%, to account for increases in costs overall.",153,,
1313,0.97,8149.274,8152.244,"Like that is the unexpected hits, like the increase in the supply chain impact.",153,,
1314,0.97,8152.244,8160.118,"You know, sorry again director loader if you are listening.",153,,
1315,0.97,8160.118,8161.153,But in time the I.T.,153,,
1316,0.97,8161.153,8165.09,"Project, those things that were unexpected and coming in at much higher than anticipated.",153,,
1317,0.97,8165.09,8168.026,So that is one thing I want to mention here.,153,,
1318,0.97,8168.026,8195.854,"The other thing I want to mention is in thinking about if we think about under spent in the budget, holding vacancies as a way of generating savings is an excellent one time to all where departments can make agreements to hold or defer certain work for a year or maybe two years or maybe they shift the work onto other staff.",153,,
1319,0.97,8195.854,8216.007,"But it is not an ongoing balancing pool and I think what is really hard for all of us is that at one point every physician in the city was vital, so vital that likely the executive proposed it and Council approved it, otherwise it would not exist.",153,,
1320,0.97,8216.007,8220.879,"And so what we have not been able to do, a much harder conversation is talking about not doing that body of work long-term.",153,,
1321,0.97,8220.879,8224.583,And that is what is going to get you on that operating mind to ongoing savings.,153,,
1322,0.97,8224.583,8232.157,That is where I just want to caution Overreliance on those one-time tools.,153,,
1323,0.97,8232.157,8236.528,"So, Yeah, if that did not make sense then feel free to ask me a clarifying question.",153,,
1324,0.97,8236.528,8251.543,"But I want to try to convey that it is a good one-time tool but not necessarily a great ongoing tool without accompanying changes in expectations of Department performance, projects, and services.",153,,
1325,0.97,8251.543,8252.277,Thank you.,154,,
1326,0.97,8252.277,8257.015,I will turn to Councilmember Herbold in just a second.,154,,
1327,0.97,8257.015,8264.389,I want to make sure I understood as well an important point of I think the analysis Mmo in front of us.,154,,
1328,0.97,8264.389,8269.794,"Which is, under spend for 2022 may help us for 2023 budget.",154,,
1329,0.97,8269.794,8272.03,But it does not help us for the outgoing years.,154,,
1330,0.97,8272.03,8290.382,"And I think to that point, what we are looking at when we talk about Rightsizing is not having a budget that every year Overinvest into positions where you seat 100+ million dollars carrying over every year.",154,,
1331,0.97,8290.382,8309.801,"I do not think that is solid budgeting as well to have budgeted constantly at a elevated rate, where you see the amount being transferred into the second or transferred back to the general fund because of chronic under spending.",154,,
1332,0.97,8309.801,8322.28,"If there is a right SIZING of that initial investment in a budget, hopefully by annual budget, not just 12 year calendar budget.",154,,
1333,0.97,8322.28,8327.752,But when there is the Rightsizing of a budget then we know what the actual universal dollars is for the programs and services.,154,,
1334,0.97,8327.752,8336.728,And I saw Tom come off of Butte as well and I see your hand director Dingley but want to make sure that both are true.,154,,
1335,0.97,8336.728,8336.961,Right?,154,,
1336,0.97,8336.961,8342.867,We do not want to have chronic under span under spend.,154,,
1337,0.97,8342.867,8343.068,Tom?,154,,
1338,0.97,8343.068,8345.37,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,155,,
1339,0.97,8345.37,8350.275,This is the technical perspective of having the plans be useful.,155,,
1340,0.97,8350.275,8354.813,And I appreciate director Dingley's comment about the work.,155,,
1341,0.97,8354.813,8358.016,And I echo at back to your staff and all that help.,155,,
1342,0.97,8358.016,8363.488,We try to use or have used the same modeling approach that CBO uses.,155,,
1343,0.97,8363.488,8372.397,We have played the same things that CBO's plan is in play.,155,,
1344,0.97,8372.397,8378.87,We need to regroup and perhaps have a critical conversation about using the feedback process.,155,,
1345,0.97,8378.87,8398.923,"How to improve the future projections and perhaps other categories, the current models used by the executive and now that we have discussed today, including the more thorough inflationary projections, again if the plan is useful.",155,,
1346,0.97,8398.923,8400.291,That make sense.,156,,
1347,0.97,8400.291,8403.628,Director Dingley?,156,,
1348,0.97,8403.628,8404.229,Thank you.,157,,
1349,0.97,8404.229,8411.302,"I appreciate that Tom, as well.",157,,
1350,0.97,8411.302,8417.575,We are still in our Deliberative process of figuring out how this is all going to look.,157,,
1351,0.97,8417.575,8422.313,So it is in no way would I expect what Tom puts in front of you today to capture every single nuance.,157,,
1352,0.97,8422.313,8427.619,"I think what you are hearing me signaled to you is that I am already seeing pressures, increased pressures on those costs.",157,,
1353,0.97,8427.619,8438.196,"I want you to have that in the back of your minds, it is not finding $30 million and we are done, walk away kind of situation.",157,,
1354,0.97,8438.196,8442.734,I do not want you to be caught surprised when I come back and actually it is a bit more.,157,,
1355,0.97,8442.734,8445.937,"One other point I want to make, chair, you raised a great point.",157,,
1356,0.97,8445.937,8460.952,"I meant to bring it up earlier, but in working with Glenn Lee's office, director Lee's office, we are doing really exciting work about starting up enhanced monitoring throughout the city.",157,,
1357,0.97,8460.952,8469.16,So I share the frustration of having empty budget sitting around and not going out there to be used for the highest and best priority.,157,,
1358,0.97,8469.16,8479.671,"And best laid plans, there is a lot of circumstance I can happen in a Department, change in administration has a big impact and changing leadership.",157,,
1359,0.97,8479.671,8483.041,There is a lot of personnel changes that can come with that as well.,157,,
1360,0.97,8483.041,8499.691,"But nonetheless we are enhancing funding city wide, so we will be having accounting meetings with analysts, directors, Department Finance directors, to have critical conversations about, Hey, we are seeing this trend.",157,,
1361,0.97,8499.691,8501.459,What is going on here?,157,,
1362,0.97,8501.459,8515.406,And we have had those conversations in the past but have not had the tools to back them up and now we have the technical capability with our new financial management system and the great partnership with director Lee's office.,157,,
1363,0.97,8515.406,8523.748,"That is something I am excited about and it will not be a one year fix, it will be something that will take us a while to get right.",157,,
1364,0.97,8523.748,8528.019,But I wanted you all to know that I am hot on the trail of getting that right sized.,157,,
1365,0.97,8528.019,8535.693,"Thank you and thank you for your patience, and Councilmember Herbold go ahead.",158,,
1366,0.97,8535.693,8537.495,My question was originally around payroll tax.,159,,
1367,0.97,8537.495,8541.599,"The surplus above projected, but I will not go back to that.",159,,
1368,0.97,8541.599,8547.539,[Laughter] since the time has come and gone for that topic and I can ask my questions Off- line.,159,,
1369,0.97,8547.539,8568.259,"I do want to flag just that I am struggling with Madam chair, your distinction of a cut budget and not wanting to do a, to do austerity budgeting from this exercise.",159,,
1370,0.97,8568.259,8572.997,Which it has the expenditure reduction.,159,,
1371,0.97,8572.997,8583.141,It sounds like we are trying to make some sort of a distinction here that an expenditure reduction is somehow different than a cut.,159,,
1372,0.97,8583.141,8603.962,"And I think what I hear you saying is that you are trying, the expenditure reduction is attempting to maybe not model but sort of spit all what the under spend is for the departments.",159,,
1373,0.97,8603.962,8627.485,"And I hear director Dingley saying, that may not be a solution that carries forward sort of the Sustainability that we are seeking for future budgets in this ongoing planning exercise that hopefully will become routine.",159,,
1374,0.97,8627.485,8648.973,"But I guess in the spirit of spit balling, I guess maybe this is the same thing you are striving to do, Madam chair, I remember as it relates to, and Councilmember Pedersen will remember this because I have talked about it a lot.",159,,
1375,0.97,8648.973,8660.652,"As it relates to our efforts to reduce all public utilities rate increases, we went through an exercise of their capital projects.",159,,
1376,0.97,8660.652,8670.962,"And we identified an annual likely completion date, likely completion rate for the projects.",159,,
1377,0.97,8670.962,8689.447,"Again the large balances for capital projects were transferring over year after year after year, and that was then becoming the rationale for a much larger rate increase.",159,,
1378,0.97,8689.447,8702.226,And when you looked at really what they were spending on those projects you could have a smaller rate increase to sustain what was actually being spent on those capital projects.,159,,
1379,0.97,8702.226,8726.317,"So on the operating side it sounds to me like a what we should be looking at is whether or not we can assume some sort of--you know--under spend rate, for the departments based on past practices or past real, real time or past analysis of prior years.",159,,
1380,0.97,8726.317,8728.753,That is basically how they set the SP.,159,,
1381,0.97,8728.753,8738.463,"They look at the prior years and say, how many of the dollars are we actually delivering year after year after year?",159,,
1382,0.97,8738.463,8744.469,And they sat the completion rate based on the actual best practices.,159,,
1383,0.97,8744.469,8761.319,"I am wondering if we move at past years operating budgets, under spends in transferring over the future years, whether or not we could come to similar conclusions upon which to base future budgeting.",159,,
1384,0.97,8761.319,8767.825,"Thank you very much vice chair, yes, I think that is exactly my desire as well.",160,,
1385,0.97,8767.825,8801.125,"I think, and I will turn to director Pennucci and Dingley in just a second, but as we are seeing a certain percentage across departments being carried over into the next year, is there a routine under spend analysis or a routine under spend and analysis we can extrapolate to say, perhaps there is a way to look at higher than needed in each year after year.",160,,
1386,0.97,8801.125,8820.578,"I see the caution where it may solve a near-term issue for the next budgeting cycle but maybe if we look at doing that Year- Over-Year, the dollar amounts from past analyses may not help us as much given the unknowns that were described.",160,,
1387,0.97,8820.578,8822.146,But that is what I like to do.,160,,
1388,0.97,8822.146,8829.554,And try to apply some sort of forecast to what we can potentially participate.,160,,
1389,0.97,8829.554,8851.876,"So I will add to my list of Takeaways here, in addition to the catalog of General fund adjacent revenue that we can look at, looking at a year over year analysis, I think under spend for the past practices to try to extrapolate some way to apply that if we were to go to a Rightsizing option as well in the future.",160,,
1390,0.97,8851.876,8854.445,Still recognizing the caveat of the additional increase of cost overall.,160,,
1391,0.97,8854.445,8863.12,"Director Pennucci, director Dingley, then we will see if there are additional questions.",160,,
1392,0.97,8863.12,8863.921,Thank you.,161,,
1393,0.97,8863.921,8878.436,You more or less made my point which was going to be that we are interested in talking with CBO and forecast office about doing a longer look back at the historic Variants in the projections.,161,,
1394,0.97,8878.436,8894.518,"But also we will just note, as what director Dingley highlighted, that it will help us one time, the more efficient that we are close at Actuals, the budget adopted, the less sort of opportunity there is.",161,,
1395,0.97,8894.518,8906.697,Especially when central staff is looking for ways for one-time strategy to support Council proposals during the budget proposal.,161,,
1396,0.97,8906.697,8917.341,"It squeezes it out so the better that we get a projecting annual expenditures, the than that will just be a one-time option.",161,,
1397,0.97,8917.341,8923.381,Which is a worthy exercise and I am looking forward to Partnering more with Julie as they move into their deeper work into enhancing their oversight of the Actuals.,161,,
1398,0.97,8939.63,8942.4,Dr. Dingley.,162,,
1399,0.97,8942.4,8944.302,Thank you so much.,163,,
1400,0.97,8944.302,8949.607,"I want you to know that we do every year, but not in every Department.",163,,
1401,0.97,8949.607,8953.711,Sometimes it is as much as 3%.,163,,
1402,0.97,8953.711,8960.785,"Sometimes it is as high as 5%, depending on what the Department happens to know about operations in any given year.",163,,
1403,0.97,8960.785,8963.421,A lot of times we are already taking that in.,163,,
1404,0.97,8963.421,8972.063,"Officially we have general over fund targets, looking at past practice.",163,,
1405,0.97,8972.063,8976.4,I do not believe that we have one in the 2022 adoptive budget but no we have done it in the past.,163,,
1406,0.97,8976.4,8978.502,Actually it is a tool in our disposal.,163,,
1407,0.97,8978.502,8991.882,"I wanted to highlight that the slide Tom previously had up of all the different options, apologies Tom, if we are still on option one here, of things to explore.",163,,
1408,0.97,8991.882,8993.951,But the answer lies in a combination of these.,163,,
1409,0.97,8993.951,8996.287,Of these things.,163,,
1410,0.97,8996.287,8997.388,Right?,163,,
1411,0.97,8997.388,9000.024,No one of these items is sort of the salvation.,163,,
1412,0.97,9000.024,9000.658,Overall.,163,,
1413,0.97,9000.658,9013.337,"And there is no path, there are too many double negatives, in order to avoid the austerity budget we have to employ all the tools.",163,,
1414,0.97,9013.337,9017.441,And there is no path to balancing that relies on only one tool.,163,,
1415,0.97,9017.441,9024.949,And so I just want to--that for you is all.,163,,
1416,0.97,9024.949,9026.65,That may be a good Segue.,164,,
1417,0.97,9026.65,9030.855,"Tom, I do not see a fourth bullet on the slide and I think another one is revenue.",164,,
1418,0.97,9030.855,9049.573,"We talked a lot about looking at existing revenue streams, but I think that there is still the situation, even with the passage of Jumpstart, that we are a very Regressive tax date and looking at the progressive options is a longer turn solution will be important.",164,,
1419,0.97,9049.573,9063.32,"I really appreciate that Councilmember Pedersen, in asking for the catalog of options also noted any use of revenue in general fund adjacent revenue, would need to be short-term.",164,,
1420,0.97,9063.32,9064.288,In nature.,164,,
1421,0.97,9064.288,9068.125,And potential temporary solutions.,164,,
1422,0.97,9068.125,9073.097,I look forward to filling out our presentation here a little bit more.,164,,
1423,0.97,9073.097,9075.099,I know we are already over time.,164,,
1424,0.97,9075.099,9078.769,And I see two hands.,164,,
1425,0.97,9078.769,9083.107,"So, I want to make sure that we get a chance to go through the last slides here.",164,,
1426,0.97,9083.107,9085.376,Director Pennucci did you have additional --,164,,
1427,0.97,9085.376,9086.343,Yes.,165,,
1428,0.97,9086.343,9095.152,"It very quickly, I just wanted to note that not explicitly stated is new forms of revenue.",165,,
1429,0.97,9095.152,9113.771,"You could look at any of the options and assume that if there was a new source of revenue that in the amount shown, like instead of 3% expenditure reduction, if it was 3%, you know, that amount of money was increasing the revenue, it would also help balance.",165,,
1430,0.97,9113.771,9132.79,"So I think you should be thinking of these options as, you know, improvement, like the optimistic forecast would show if there was the improvement in the economic condition or if we had a new line of source funds to support the general fund to increase revenues accordingly.",165,,
1431,0.97,9132.79,9143.968,"To your point Councilmember Mosqueda, you can also look at any of these points of being what would be assumed if there was additional revenues, except for the pessimistic forecast.",165,,
1432,0.97,9143.968,9144.568,Thank you.,166,,
1433,0.97,9144.568,9154.411,"And I want to thank you--trend six, the--Herbold, and the revenue task force.",166,,
1434,0.97,9154.411,9169.527,"And the revenue task force of course can look at the ways that we offset some of the revenue streams that might be harder, Impacting communities of color, or smaller businesses harder.",166,,
1435,0.97,9169.527,9173.964,Maybe there is a way to offset some of those revenue streams if we look at more progressive options as well.,166,,
1436,0.97,9173.964,9175.866,Heart of the task force is looking at various strategies.,166,,
1437,0.97,9175.866,9187.011,"Thank you to Dr. Dingley, senior deputy Mayor Harold for bringing their work into the operation.",166,,
1438,0.97,9187.011,9189.947,Councilmember Nelson?,166,,
1439,0.97,9189.947,9190.748,Thank you.,167,,
1440,0.97,9190.748,9195.619,"If we are looking for policy direction here, I do not know.",167,,
1441,0.97,9195.619,9204.261,I was not here when the panel of experts talked about the benefits of Progressive spending over austerity spending.,167,,
1442,0.97,9204.261,9204.695,And the difference.,167,,
1443,0.97,9204.695,9221.979,"I mean the semantic difference between Rightsizing and austerity, some of the nuances are lost on me but basically Rightsizing per the memo here is Rightsizing general fund budgets to better align actual expenditures with appropriations and/or reductions in services.",167,,
1444,0.97,9221.979,9222.98,That sounds reasonable to me.,167,,
1445,0.97,9222.98,9232.289,"What I think we should be doing, I appreciate the option of using alternative revenue forecasts assumptions.",167,,
1446,0.97,9232.289,9236.06,Which director Pennucci touched him.,167,,
1447,0.97,9236.06,9244.268,"Yes, we should always be considering alternatives to the knowledge that we have in a point of time.",167,,
1448,0.97,9244.268,9262.186,"But I will note in the central staff memo, when comparing optimistic forecast assumptions, versus pessimistic assumptions, the probability of being optimistic is 15%.",167,,
1449,0.97,9262.186,9264.822,The probability of coming true.,167,,
1450,0.97,9264.822,9270.561,Compared to the pessimistic scenario probability is 35%.,167,,
1451,0.97,9270.561,9293.484,"I think back it's to that Brown line that was physically indicating what was going on with the war and anyway the point is, it seems as though we have a duty every year to make sure that our assumptions on what will have to be spent the following year are as correct as possible.",167,,
1452,0.97,9293.484,9294.251,And then proceed forward.,167,,
1453,0.97,9294.251,9303.46,"I am not really, I do not understand, I always thought that the operating directive from CBO was assume 6% potential reduction.",167,,
1454,0.97,9303.46,9310.834,Now this is 3. may be off-line I can get a better sense of those differences in numbers.,167,,
1455,0.97,9310.834,9315.105,But I just wanted to lay this all out before we continue.,167,,
1456,0.97,9315.105,9325.883,Since it seems that that will definitely impact whether or not we do consider additional revenue sources going forward.,167,,
1457,0.97,9325.883,9328.318,Thanks.,167,,
1458,0.97,9328.318,9329.52,"Directlyor Dingley, very quickly.",168,,
1459,0.97,9329.52,9332.323,And then let's try to round out the discussion here.,168,,
1460,0.97,9332.323,9332.723,Of course.,169,,
1461,0.97,9332.723,9333.157,Thank you.,169,,
1462,0.97,9333.157,9334.391,And thank you for the question.,169,,
1463,0.97,9334.391,9342.8,Re-We develop the target reductions before the April revenue forecast came out.,169,,
1464,0.97,9342.8,9343.834,We did really good guessing.,169,,
1465,0.97,9343.834,9344.635,And good modeling.,169,,
1466,0.97,9344.635,9354.645,"Because as I mentioned, what we are seeing in terms of the additional costs that are mandatory that we have to find the funding to cover, it is more in the 6% realm.",169,,
1467,0.97,9354.645,9359.55,So we have sort of 3% that you see as ongoing.,169,,
1468,0.97,9359.55,9366.323,As modeling here as shown as known.,169,,
1469,0.97,9366.323,9368.759,And then the additional 3% is unknown and has come into view.,169,,
1470,0.97,9368.759,9374.331,In the Deliberative phase.,169,,
1471,0.97,9374.331,9375.299,That I am in right now.,169,,
1472,0.97,9375.299,9378.235,And said that additional reduction is needed in order to bring us to balance.,169,,
1473,0.97,9378.235,9379.036,If that helps.,169,,
1474,0.97,9379.036,9379.403,Great.,170,,
1475,0.97,9379.403,9380.304,Thank you.,170,,
1476,0.97,9380.304,9381.605,All right.,170,,
1477,0.97,9381.605,9382.773,"Tom, let's finish the presentation.",170,,
1478,0.97,9382.773,9384.475,If there is anything else you would like to share.,170,,
1479,0.97,9384.475,9388.178,And then we can talk about the next steps that are listed on page 15.,170,,
1480,0.97,9388.178,9390.581,Thank you Madam chair.,171,,
1481,0.97,9390.581,9419.543,"Again, continuing the analysis of the different possibilities and building off of Councilmember Nelson's comments about the different forecasts, indeed these projections are seen in the baseline forecast, although there are lower probability scenarios that could come to pass based on the imperfect information.",171,,
1482,0.97,9419.543,9423.18,"We just went ahead by way of sensitivity of the projections, Includingscenarios that include the different options.",171,,
1483,0.97,9423.18,9431.155,"The first we are looking at here on this slide is, what if we are using the optimistic forecast?",171,,
1484,0.97,9431.155,9435.692,Which is the 15% probability compared to 50% with the baseline.,171,,
1485,0.97,9435.692,9436.693,What would happen?,171,,
1486,0.97,9436.693,9449.039,"So that would bring the projected operating gap down to $82 million, in 2023, and $71 million in 2024.",171,,
1487,0.97,9449.039,9452.276,"It would actually, by 2026, it would be nearly zero.",171,,
1488,0.97,9452.276,9461.418,"The 2023 ending balance would be a positive $14 million, that would be balanced by state law.",171,,
1489,0.97,9461.418,9468.158,And then 2024 projected for the endorsed budget would be still $-57 million.,171,,
1490,0.97,9468.158,9473.063,And again this is not a recommendation or endorsement.,171,,
1491,0.97,9473.063,9481.939,"The forecast Council has endorsed and spoken with regards to the baseline forecast, so that is what we are sticking with for purposes of projection.",171,,
1492,0.97,9481.939,9485.042,"But that is kind of the bright, the Brightside scenario.",171,,
1493,0.97,9485.042,9508.899,"The other, you know, given due consideration of alternatives, the less, the more dour and pessimistic scenario, 35% probability, and that is sort of in line with if you read the financial and economic literature and news as much as I do, generally consistent with what economists are predicting for chances of her session.",171,,
1494,0.97,9508.899,9521.011,"That would greatly impact the operating gap and bring projection down to, in fact a higher gap in the current year.",171,,
1495,0.97,9521.011,9525.549,By $31 million more of less revenue.,171,,
1496,0.97,9525.549,9530.087,Though it is not again a gap per se.,171,,
1497,0.97,9530.087,9531.488,But just wanted to point that out.,171,,
1498,0.97,9531.488,9539.463,Because that would be the current year impacts.,171,,
1499,0.97,9539.463,9544.201,"But Moreover we are looking at future budget, $173 million gap in 2023 and $192 million gap in 2024.",171,,
1500,0.97,9544.201,9550.007,Again this is a scenario and not the most likely one.,171,,
1501,0.97,9550.007,9561.518,"Again looking at these numbers and building off of, you know, this is still a work in progress commentary from director Dingley, the revenue is also a similar work in progress.",171,,
1502,0.97,9561.518,9568.992,"The April numbers that were presented to the Committee on the 20th of last month, were the first of six looks at revenue.",171,,
1503,0.97,9568.992,9579.403,And reasonably expected to have large Variances of certain projections.,171,,
1504,0.97,9579.403,9588.478,"So just pointing that out, there will be two additional looks this year that will form the reality about how much revenue there is to spend, in the next few years.",171,,
1505,0.97,9588.478,9591.148,And that will be used for purposes of balancing the budget.,171,,
1506,0.97,9591.148,9592.816,So you know we could trend either way.,171,,
1507,0.97,9592.816,9605.228,"But I wanted to point that out, we are still in early innings with regards to forecasting next year's budget.",171,,
1508,0.97,9605.228,9609.099,"And if we can move to, if there are no questions about that, moving to the next slide.",171,,
1509,0.97,9609.099,9621.411,"And this is building from an earlier comment I made about how the projected deficit, you can see in the top line of the table is smaller in the future than it is in the more Near- term.",171,,
1510,0.97,9621.411,9631.388,"Given, you know, projection of more rapidly recovering revenues later in the year, not next year per se but in the future.",171,,
1511,0.97,9631.388,9650.707,"So again just by way of modeling the different ways, kind of building off of the myriad of approaches, the comment from director Dingley, this is a way of saying, doing a $79 million long-term measure, whatever that may be revenue or expenditure.",171,,
1512,0.97,9650.707,9662.486,And then balancing the higher gap in the near term with temporary measures.,171,,
1513,0.97,9662.486,9668.492,"And just for the purposes of this analysis, looked at the 2025 projection, because that is when the deficit starts to decrease.",171,,
1514,0.97,9668.492,9678.468,And then basically imputed how much short-term support would be necessary to balance things out.,171,,
1515,0.97,9678.468,9689.112,So as you can see the revised balance is actually a positive $82 million at the end of 2023 and then Grossed at $22 million at the end of 2024.,171,,
1516,0.97,9689.112,9692.416,So that is significant extra one-time resource.,171,,
1517,0.97,9692.416,9696.119,Using this type of approach.,171,,
1518,0.97,9696.119,9709.633,"So it kind of triggered the thought of, well, what if, instead we model and approach that relied on this balance's going into 2023, and mitigated, and the need for longer-term measure.",171,,
1519,0.97,9709.633,9717.107,So that is how this works.,171,,
1520,0.97,9717.107,9718.175,We added a long-term measure.,171,,
1521,0.97,9718.175,9728.385,"So, again, this is the concept of a revenue option, perhaps, that take some time to ramp up, that doesn't start until 2024, $65 million, just for purposes of making the numbers work.",171,,
1522,0.97,9728.385,9737.561,"Then Legging in the same temporary measures, $48 million a year, bringing the ending balance to a positive number.",171,,
1523,0.97,9737.561,9748.472,"So if this approach uses a combination of fund balance, ongoing structural measures, which are revenue or expenditure in nature, in the second year, and temporary measures.",171,,
1524,0.97,9748.472,9755.612,"In 2023-24, to then make the numbers balance out based on the projections.",171,,
1525,0.97,9755.612,9759.483,Which of course are in development and will change in the next look.,171,,
1526,0.97,9759.483,9766.223,But I hope that that is helpful in forming thoughts of different approaches and decisions that can be made.,171,,
1527,0.97,9766.223,9773.396,"Great, we will also just emphasize that this is a thought exercise.",172,,
1528,0.97,9773.396,9776.099,And it has been noted by CBO and central staff.,172,,
1529,0.97,9776.099,9790.647,"So I do not want folks to necessarily think that these are too two options, they are various scenarios that can be mixed and matched in certain ways, and various levers can be pulled.",172,,
1530,0.97,9790.647,9804.895,"And as director Dingley noted, all options on the option list if deployed together could be mixed and matched and try to get us into the the black.",172,,
1531,0.97,9804.895,9807.164,So the ending on the next steps is Realy important here.,172,,
1532,0.97,9807.164,9813.703,"And then also summarizing on page 15 of the memo, this is really for context, as committee members we are very interested in what is the bottom line.",172,,
1533,0.97,9813.703,9815.372,What is this mean for us in 2022?,172,,
1534,0.97,9815.372,9816.473,"Yes, in terms of adopted budget.",172,,
1535,0.97,9816.473,9819.042,But also how do we prepare for 2023 and beyond?,172,,
1536,0.97,9819.042,9828.952,In looking at the financial health of the city's budget for the next six years is something that after today we are all committed to.,172,,
1537,0.97,9828.952,9831.755,Additional comments and I saw director Pennucci come off of mute.,172,,
1538,0.97,9831.755,9840.363,Anything else you want to add to that?,172,,
1539,0.97,9840.363,9841.198,"Nope, thank you.",173,,
1540,0.97,9841.198,9842.232,I think you covered it.,173,,
1541,0.97,9842.232,9843.066,Thank you.,174,,
1542,0.97,9843.066,9844.067,"Director Dingley, anything to add?",174,,
1543,0.97,9844.067,9846.403,"No, just to say, thank you for having me today.",175,,
1544,0.97,9846.403,9847.17,Of course.,176,,
1545,0.97,9847.17,9847.571,Thank you.,176,,
1546,0.97,9847.571,9858.615,"And please pass on your, and please pass on our appreciation to your team as well.",176,,
1547,0.97,9858.615,9862.752,Again we will have this six year financial plan presented for the Finance and housing committee meeting in August.,176,,
1548,0.97,9862.752,9868.558,After we receive the additional information from the revenue forecast office and the city budget's office.,176,,
1549,0.97,9868.558,9875.232,And the August presentations.,176,,
1550,0.97,9875.232,9879.669,"We anticipate at the end of September, as per usual, the Mayor's post budget will be coming down.",176,,
1551,0.97,9879.669,9882.706,We are coming back to the biannual budget of sorts.,176,,
1552,0.97,9882.706,9901.291,"So a 2023 adopted and, excuse me, 2023 adopted, 2024 endorsed, and this will hopefully be one of the last times we do a Semi-Biannual budget.",176,,
1553,0.97,9901.291,9905.562,Because we are all looking forward to the biannual budgeting.,176,,
1554,0.97,9905.562,9921.344,"And again colleagues, I think that there will be many more conversations that follow that all of us will be having, about ways to address these issues, leading into August.",176,,
1555,0.97,9921.344,9922.112,If not before.,176,,
1556,0.97,9922.112,9929.119,"Again, thanks to the executive team for pulling together the revenue task force, thanks to the city budget office for continuing to work in such tight coordination and collaboration with the city central staff here.",176,,
1557,0.97,9929.119,9932.155,Looking forward to the Follow- up on the catalog concept.,176,,
1558,0.97,9932.155,9936.393,The longer look back at the historic unspent trends.,176,,
1559,0.97,9936.393,9944.034,And also keeping in mind Short- term strategies versus long- term ways to address the budget needs.,176,,
1560,0.97,9944.034,9952.309,"Really good news on monitoring, and the real-time tracking of budget expenditures by the departments.",176,,
1561,0.97,9952.309,9955.845,Thank you director Dingley for the update there.,176,,
1562,0.97,9955.845,9962.952,And colleagues I know we will also be closely tracking what is going on in Congress as well about any additional relief that may be coming.,176,,
1563,0.97,9962.952,9973.63,"But absent additional Federal relief, we know what the budget is from the state, which will provide tremendous relief in food assistance and rental assistance and things like this.",176,,
1564,0.97,9973.63,9976.7,But we have a long-term need that we will continue to look at.,176,,
1565,0.97,9976.7,9989.179,"This has been very illuminating, I want to thank everyone for the hard work it has taken to get to this place, providing this detailed analysis of the six-year outlook.",176,,
1566,0.97,9989.179,9996.119,"And there will be more conversations to come, colleagues, as we get the information that you requested from central staff.",176,,
1567,0.97,9996.119,10002.425,And obviously having more conversations with the executive members of community as well.,176,,
1568,0.97,10002.425,10012.302,"So with that, not sing additional hands, thank you both, both teams, central staff team and executives city legislation office for your help with the hesitation.",176,,
1569,0.97,10012.302,10019.175,Thank you for the memo and walking through the materials today.,176,,
1570,0.97,10019.175,10024.147,We have reached our agenda and the final meeting will be may 18th at 9:30 A.M.,176,,
1571,0.97,10024.147,10039.162,"We are finalizing the agenda and you can expect to see the 2021 asked fund budget expended ordinance, and hoping to make a budgeting tool exceptional and more to come on that conversation.",176,,
1572,0.97,10039.162,10045.702,"We will also have the annual housing levee report and the item that we carried forward from today, the office of housing staffing plan.",176,,
1573,0.97,10045.702,10052.342,"And with that, thanks for your engagement and participation colleagues.",176,,
1574,0.97,10052.342,10053.176,Our committee meeting is adjourned.,176,,
1575,0.97,10053.176,10054.944,Have a great rest of,176,,
