38,0.97,120.954,122.956,Thank you.,23,,
39,0.97,122.956,134.934,I move that the proposed agenda be amended to add CBA 504 the 002 2022.,23,,

41,0.97,137.57,140.073,Thank you very much.,24,,
42,0.97,140.073,142.575,Councilmember Sawant has moved the item.,24,,
43,0.97,142.575,144.377,Is there a second?,24,,
44,0.97,144.377,145.979,Second.,25,,
45,0.97,145.979,156.089,It has been moved and Seconded to amend today's agenda by adding CBA Sdot 002.,26,,
46,0.97,156.089,156.456,2022.,26,,
47,0.97,156.456,163.062,Councilmember Sawant you are recognized to address this amendment to the agenda very briefly.,26,,
48,0.97,163.062,171.704,"Thank you, this budget agenda is essentially the same as what was agenda item 159 on last Thursday's meeting agenda.",27,,
49,0.97,171.704,178.511,Which I was unable to move or speak to when I was out sick.,27,,
50,0.97,178.511,188.321,This amendment on behalf of the people's budget and the solidarity budget would increase the funding for affordable housing to $635 million in 2022.,27,,
51,0.97,188.321,192.625,And the funding for the green new deal building Decarbonization by $85 million per year.,27,,
52,0.97,192.625,203.002,This budget amendment would fully fund the recommendations for housing in the green new deal and the people's budget and the Solider budget.,27,,
53,0.97,203.002,208.541,And will fund the housing and green new deal's of working people towards the scale of the crisis.,27,,
54,0.97,208.541,216.549,"This budget amendment is self balancing, raising the funds by increasing the rate of the payroll expense tax on large corporations.",27,,
55,0.97,216.549,228.328,The budget amendment also includes bond authorization to find affordable housing and funds the yearly green new deal work and debt service payments with the increase in the payroll expense tax.,27,,
56,0.97,228.328,236.135,"Because it increases the size of this year's bond, it is technically an amendment to the Council budget action that passed this year's bond registration.",27,,
57,0.97,236.135,250.783,"However because that increase is fully funded with the increase in the tax rate, the real substance of this amendment is that it increases the tax to fund the housing.",27,,
58,0.97,250.783,256.489,Last but not least I will say that all Councilmembers have talked about the need for new progressive revenues.,27,,
59,0.97,256.489,259.592,"But, I think ultimately it's a question of actually doing it.",27,,
60,0.97,259.592,269.902,We know we have this new--big business tax at our disposal.,27,,
61,0.97,269.902,278.111,I think it is our moral and political responsibility to expand it as much as possible in order to bring affordable housing and green new deal funding to the scale of the crisis that is is called for.,27,,
62,0.97,278.111,289.088,Also keeping in mind that some of those salmon corporations have profited more during the pandemic when ordinary people have actually lost out.,27,,
63,0.97,289.088,295.028,I think this also is relevant to the extensive discussion that we are seeing on crime and community safety.,27,,
64,0.97,295.028,305.405,We know statistics show that public safety is best served by making sure that we have adequate funding for affordable housing and other social services.,27,,
65,0.97,305.405,306.739,Thank you.,27,,
66,0.97,306.739,310.243,I hope you will support this.,27,,
67,0.97,310.243,312.312,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",28,,
68,0.97,312.312,318.518,Councilmember Sawant has moved to amend the agenda.,28,,
69,0.97,318.518,320.92,"Are there any additional comments, or are there any questions?",28,,
70,0.97,320.92,321.12,Okay.,28,,
71,0.97,321.12,323.156,I'm not hearing any additional comments and questions.,28,,

73,0.97,328.528,331.497,On Thursday last week I did have a chance to move item 159 for you.,28,,
74,0.97,331.497,341.174,We did not have the opportunity to hear any other Councilmembers Express interest in hearing 159.,28,,
75,0.97,341.174,354.687,"At this point colleagues, given where we are at in the agenda for today, and the upcoming deliberations that will take place to finalize this suggested budget, I am hoping that we can continue with our budget as it is in tact.",28,,
76,0.97,354.687,364.597,There is also as requested by the solidarity budget coalition the request to have a task force to come up with the additional progressive revenue.,28,,
77,0.97,364.597,372.505,"Very supportive of working to add additional progressive revenue, but at this juncture in the budget I would encourage us to keep the agenda intact for today.",28,,
78,0.97,372.505,377.176,"Okay, Madam clerk, could you please call the roll on the amendment to the agenda?",28,,

199,0.97,756.255,764.964,It's obvious that the priorities of the city council budget have refused to truly deal with public safety and the homeless crisis.,78,,
200,0.97,764.964,772.071,Both of which are Co-Related to the suffering and unnecessary Victimization of the community at large.,78,,
201,0.97,772.071,785.584,"With all the forsaken discriminated against homeless people subjected to the predatory customs by letting criminals, conducting crimes against humanity, and being listed nonviolent Misdemeanors.",78,,
202,0.97,785.584,789.788,Exempted from jail by the city council.,78,,
203,0.97,789.788,807.339,"Shame on the city council for using this budget to redirect millions of needed dollars to solve a crisis of society Implosion, while Squandering billions more dollars throwing away environmental structures every time criminals use taxpayer produced infrastructure to sell drugs.",78,,
204,0.97,807.339,820.953,"Instead of throwing criminals in jail, city council instructs government to throw away park benches and potted plants and break up one bus stop into three as it is making it safer from criminals conducting on Civil war on innocent community with immunity.",78,,
205,0.97,820.953,837.57,"To this day, city Council and Mayor proved to be the biggest threat to civilized society by sabotaging police, redirecting money away from the public safety, and the homeless crisis, to simply buy off protesters Intimidating Council and the Mayor.",78,,
206,0.97,837.57,841.273,Capitulating to the devil's advocates at our expense.,78,,
207,0.97,841.273,848.314,Yeah you are using our budget to finance a reelection apparatus while never solving the public safety and homeless crisis.,78,,
208,0.97,848.314,862.294,And the need to invest your core--your corrupt political donors who own all the homeless contracts filled with skin color discrimination Agendas and Low-Quality Subhuman Mistreatment.,78,,
209,0.97,862.294,877.009,"There is enough money to shelter every homeless person this winter, yet city council only Prioritized criminal repeat offenders to be moved into a hotel while upstanding citizens are being forsaken.",78,,
210,0.97,877.009,880.512,That are not committing the crimes against humanity.,78,,
211,0.97,880.512,882.715,That are purposely not being helped with unqualified --,78,,
212,0.97,882.715,884.817,"Thank you very much, David.",79,,

216,0.97,891.323,892.391,Good morning.,80,,
217,0.97,892.391,898.13,"Howard Gail, speaking on the continuing funding of the field police accountability system.",80,,
218,0.97,898.13,929.161,"Over the last three months we have learned from five investigations published in the South Seattle, and an investigation, that the director of the office of police accountability, whose entire career has been spent defending the police and who has engaged in professional misconduct as a city attorney, has committed gross Malfeasance in investigating police abuse and violated state laws in Accessing information of a Protester who was nearly killed in 2020.",80,,
219,0.97,929.161,941.941,"The OPA director has judged nearly 90% of last year's police abuse cases against demonstrators to be without merit and has found every single SPD killing that he investigated to be quote, lawful and proper,"".",80,,
220,0.97,941.941,956.288,"We have learned that the director of the office of Inspector general, the subject, has allowed the routine certification of these flawed routine investigations by a person with a 23 year career as a police officer.",80,,
221,0.97,956.288,959.358,Without looking at evidence and sometimes without even interviewing the investigations.,80,,
222,0.97,959.358,966.699,"We just recently found out that that Indvidual, who has been reviewing investigations, is still doing it.",80,,
223,0.97,966.699,979.712,"We have learned that the director of the Oig has encouraged its investigators to ignore OPA failures, and has worked diligently to undercut the public records act by mandating that employees not put complaints or concerns in writing.",80,,
224,0.97,979.712,989.288,"In fact, into the system you now want to put more money for public disclosure, even though Oig is fighting against public disclosure.",80,,
225,0.97,989.288,991.79,Into this failed system you now plan to put $10.8 million.,80,,
226,0.97,991.79,993.392,This is an epic failure of oversight.,80,,
227,0.97,993.392,1000.799,We must invest these monies in a system that provides full civilian community control over police.,80,,
228,0.97,1000.799,1003.435,"Over there misconduct investigations, and over discipline.",80,,
229,0.97,1003.435,1006.338,As so many seers have done post George Floyd.,80,,

257,0.97,1116.048,1119.618,That does conclude our last select budget committee meeting public comment.,85,,
258,0.97,1119.618,1124.523,That will move us into items on today's agenda.,86,,
259,0.97,1124.523,1127.626,"Madam clerk, could you please read item 1 into the record?",86,,
260,0.97,1127.626,1139.171,"Agenda item 1, a review of amendments, staff overview to select budget committee amendments November 22nd 2021 for briefing and discussion.",87,,

262,0.97,1142.474,1153.886,"Colleagues, after eight weeks of deliberation, and really tough work, on behalf of all of your offices, members of the community, and engagement with central staff, we are ready to vote on the final 2022 balancing package.",88,,
263,0.97,1153.886,1158.59,"This, as we all know, was a particularly grueling budget cycle.",88,,
264,0.97,1158.59,1173.906,"In the middle of divisive medical climate, in the middle of contention on how we can make sure that we are investing in working families and our infrastructure and our Kiddos and our seniors.",88,,
265,0.97,1173.906,1177.709,Conversations that have been Replicated at the national level as well as the local level.,88,,
266,0.97,1177.709,1183.282,We are all looking for ways to make sure that our community knows that we are investing in solutions for a more equitable Seattle.,88,,
267,0.97,1183.282,1187.92,"A more just society, and a healthy economy.",88,,
268,0.97,1187.92,1197.996,"I really appreciate how every office has continued to bring forward amendments that really focus on common ground, and items that we know our community needs.",88,,
269,0.97,1197.996,1210.309,"First, affordable housing and homeless services to make sure that we are investing in all of those who live here and ensure everyone has access to healthy housing and public safety.",88,,
270,0.97,1210.309,1220.118,"Number two, we've invested in connecting communities and thriving economies to recover more equitably and investing in our city so that it is a place that continues to attract people to want to come here to work.",88,,
271,0.97,1220.118,1221.153,To start their businesses.,88,,
272,0.97,1221.153,1225.023,To come visit our city and to make sure that families can stay and live in Seattle.,88,,
273,0.97,1225.023,1227.426,In an affordable way.,88,,
274,0.97,1227.426,1231.93,"Finally, we've invested in health and safety.",88,,
275,0.97,1231.93,1237.069,Early on in this conversation we talked about how important it was to have a budget that reflected health and hygiene services.,88,,
276,0.97,1237.069,1247.079,I believe that we have continued to do that through this budget with the support that you have put forward to making sure that we are investing in public safety and community investments.,88,,
277,0.97,1247.079,1256.288,"As well as clean cities, we have really addressed multiple public health crises that are compounding at this moment in Seattle.",88,,
278,0.97,1256.288,1265.097,I know that there is a need to continue to do much more for the conversation that we just had at the beginning of this meeting.,88,,
279,0.97,1265.097,1270.969,"I'm dedicated to continuing to do the hard work with you to make sure that there is progressive revenue that we have a dedication to good, sound financial policies.",88,,
280,0.97,1270.969,1282.914,"That is why as well am proud of the work that we've not only done for affordable housing and homelessness in our economic development and economic resilience investments, and in our clean and healthy and safe communities.",88,,
281,0.97,1282.914,1286.885,But the work that you have all done to stabilize the reserves.,88,,
282,0.97,1286.885,1291.39,We have a healthy Reserve balance coming out of this conversation over the last eight weeks.,88,,
283,0.97,1291.39,1293.925,We've actually added funding to the reserve.,88,,
284,0.97,1293.925,1308.473,"I think that's a prudent thing to do as we seek to try to recover from Covid and the impacts of the pandemic, the prepare for the potential of its ongoing impact on communities on our economy and our most Rollable.",88,,
285,0.97,1308.473,1317.249,So today colleagues we will consider 10 technical amendments and we will complete the necessary legislative changes to ensure that we can vote on the 2022 budget.,88,,
286,0.97,1317.249,1322.988,My hope is that we can move this out of committee and take final action today at our 2:00 P.M.,88,,
287,0.97,1322.988,1323.422,Meeting.,88,,
288,0.97,1323.422,1327.125,Please note that several of the changes are necessary to adopt the balancing package.,88,,
289,0.97,1327.125,1336.702,"If there is any concern or delay in final action on the budget today, there would not be the ability to make those adjustments before the end of the day.",88,,
290,0.97,1336.702,1339.571,"Thus, we would have to look at a different Timeline.",88,,
291,0.97,1339.571,1350.782,"There are 10 technical amendments that unless an item is pulled from the group, will be voted on in a consent package.",88,,
292,0.97,1350.782,1354.052,The committee voted to approve previous versions of these amendments at the committee meeting on November 18th.,88,,
293,0.97,1354.052,1368.433,So these technical amendments would help to adjust for some of the items that central staff has identified by rescinding certain actions and past revised versions described in Table 1 from the memo that was circulated from central staff yesterday.,88,,
294,0.97,1368.433,1371.503,And Recirculated this morning.,88,,
295,0.97,1371.503,1374.673,The committee voted to approve these amendments at the committee meeting on November 18th again.,88,,
296,0.97,1374.673,1384.983,So these are technical in nature in that they would be adjusting for concerns and technicalities that central staff have identified.,88,,
297,0.97,1384.983,1389.354,"So, the process today is going to be to put the consent package in front of us that includes these 10 amendments.",88,,
298,0.97,1389.354,1397.329,We will have central staff here.,88,,
299,0.97,1397.329,1401.433,They will describe each of the technical amendments included Inthe consent package.,88,,
300,0.97,1401.433,1408.24,"If at the end of that description any Council member which is to remove an item, just as we've done before, Councilmembers are welcome to note that.",88,,
301,0.97,1408.24,1413.145,It does not require a second or a vote to remove an item.,88,,
302,0.97,1413.145,1418.35,We will then consider any item that is removed from the consent package as a Standalone item after we consider adoption of the consent package.,88,,
303,0.97,1418.35,1430.862,"So, with that, to get the consent package in front of us so that we can then hear from central staff and go through each one of those, I'm going to go ahead and move it so it is in front of us and we can have a discussion.",88,,
304,0.97,1430.862,1433.532,"Colleagues, I moved to approve the consent package as listed in today's material.",88,,
305,0.97,1433.532,1435.634,Is there a second?,88,,
306,0.97,1435.634,1436.434,Second.,89,,

311,0.97,1453.251,1462.761,"Allie, I think you have done such great work with us over the past eight weeks, and Year- round.",90,,
312,0.97,1462.761,1465.197,"Very thankful all your work, and I will turn it over to.",90,,
313,0.97,1465.197,1469.701,"I was suggestive Councilmembers do have questions about any one item, we can take those as you walk through the items.",90,,
314,0.97,1469.701,1470.302,Does that sound okay?,90,,
315,0.97,1470.302,1473.004,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda, yes, that works for me.",91,,
316,0.97,1473.004,1474.673,"Okay, well good morning, chair Mosqueda.",91,,

319,0.97,1479.411,1488.42,"As chair Mosqueda just described, there are 10 technical amendments included in the consent group today that I will briefly describe.",91,,
320,0.97,1488.42,1497.929,"I'm mostly going to focus on what change that these items have been discussed at least once, if not two or three times in committee already this budget season.",91,,
321,0.97,1497.929,1503.835,"Then, if there are more detailed questions, my colleagues are also on the line who can help fill in.",91,,
322,0.97,1503.835,1509.641,I just take a moment to thank all of their work over the weekend and over the last eight weeks.,91,,
323,0.97,1509.641,1516.448,I'm happy that this is the last step in the committee process.,91,,

328,0.97,1545.944,1553.985,"In consultation with our colleagues in city budget office, it was determined that this isn't a great fit for direct use of the Clipper funds.",92,,
329,0.97,1553.985,1560.392,"So, this amendment swaps that--uses general funds instead of Clipper funds.",92,,
330,0.97,1560.392,1568.4,"Then, there's a complementary change to FG 001, number three on this list that increases the amount of Clifford funds that are used for revenue replacement.",92,,
331,0.97,1568.4,1574.372,"Again, Clifford is Coronavirus local fiscal recovery funds.",92,,
332,0.97,1574.372,1581.112,I will continue to use the Acronym just so I don't stumble over that--those words going forward.,92,,

346,0.97,1667.499,1673.204,That is for the Record-Keeping and I just want to thank my colleagues again in the city budget office for helping me get that list put together.,93,,
347,0.97,1673.204,1688.62,Fg 06 B2 . This was--this item is the--excuse me is the Council budget action that would increase the transfer to the revenue stabilization fund.,93,,
348,0.97,1688.62,1700.732,"We determined in committee last week that the description had not been updated to reflect that $400,000 increase, so this version just accurately describes the transactions that are happening in this budget amendment.",93,,
