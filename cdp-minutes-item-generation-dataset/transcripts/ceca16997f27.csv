112,0.97,776.175,781.58,We know it will go from Single- family to creating Multi-Type homes in single-family zoned areas currently.,12,,
113,0.97,781.58,790.256,This will have potential tremendous impact to the canopy as the majority of the canopy in Seattle is single-family zoning.,12,,
114,0.97,790.256,794.193,That will be large zoning change in this capacity.,12,,
115,0.97,794.193,796.395,Needs to be serious environmental impact statement.,12,,

151,0.97,997.396,1002.368,Seattle likes to think of itself as a progressive green forward thinking city but we are resting on our laurels.,18,,
152,0.97,1002.368,1017.549,"Other cities are far more progressive than Seattle in terms of tree production, those cities understand the importance of tree canopy to the health of all of the residence, especially the Bipoc and lower income communities that live in urban heat Islands.",18,,
153,0.97,1017.549,1029.528,They cannot turn off air conditioning . We are trying to reach 30% tree canopy in Seattle and are likely backsliding as David mentioned earlier.,18,,

190,0.97,1235.334,1242.24,"I know we had this briefing in committee the other day, could you provide us a brief reminder of what the legislation does?",29,,
191,0.97,1242.24,1271.069,"I will be very brief, once I went through some of the legislative history I won't do that again, I will remind committee this Iteration of the city regional Tdr program dates back to 2013, multiple ordinances to implement collectively all of those ordinances established Tdr program with Kane County . The city was utilizing authority that came from the state through advocacy of for Tara in 2007.",30,,
192,0.97,1271.069,1309.775,"What does Council bill 12108 do, allows land adopt by reference chapter of the Washington administrative code 365 198, adoption by reference Obviates the need for the city to enter into local agreements with Pierce source Gnomish County for Tdr program . I think I mentioned this on Wednesday, the city regulatory framework for Tdr, we have exchange rate for development rights that could be transferred to Snohomish County's.",30,,
193,0.97,1309.775,1331.83,"365 198 establishes requirements for cities and towns, and minimum requirements for counties where the sending sites are and joint requirements for cities and counties when it comes to reporting to each other about transferable development rights.",30,,
194,0.97,1331.83,1337.035,"One thing that I mentioned on Wednesday it is not clear to me this is self executing, there may need to be regulatory changes made.",30,,
195,0.97,1337.035,1343.141,"In addition to Snohomish County, speak to that.",30,,
196,0.97,1343.141,1348.413,That in a nutshell is what Council bill 120181 does.,30,,
197,0.97,1348.413,1349.748,"Thank you, Mr. Freeman.",31,,
198,0.97,1349.748,1354.186,"Michael, it was great to hear from you during the public hearing on Wednesday.",31,,
199,0.97,1354.186,1359.958,Could you share a bit of the King County perspective on this legislation and the Tdr program?,31,,
200,0.97,1359.958,1360.525,Absolutely.,32,,
201,0.97,1360.525,1363.962,Thanks for having me.,32,,
202,0.97,1363.962,1380.779,"Yes, King County has been the beneficiary of the agreement with Seattle since 2013 and it is a major demand for the transferable development rights from King County is a major driver for conservation in Ying County.",32,,
203,0.97,1380.779,1382.414,We have used this tool to great effect.,32,,
204,0.97,1382.414,1388.754,I believe personally and we as a county believe conservation is original endeavor.,32,,
205,0.97,1388.754,1398.897,"Chair Strauss spoke about it on Wednesday driving to Mount Rainier, driving through Pierce county or going up looking at the foothills and looking up North.",32,,
206,0.97,1398.897,1413.412,"Really, the conservation regionally benefits all of the residents in the region and with Seattle's growth, we have an opportunity for the transfer of development rights mechanism to spread the benefit to the region.",32,,
207,0.97,1413.412,1421.386,There is one other element I would like to highlight and that is for farming in particular.,32,,
208,0.97,1421.386,1439.538,"The agreement King County and Seattle have had since 2013 has done a lot to protect farms in King County, since 2013, 2000 acres at 36 different farms have been permanently detected from future development.",32,,
209,0.97,1439.538,1442.207,Farming works best when there are other farmers who confirmed their land too.,32,,
210,0.97,1442.207,1451.349,"If we have agricultural economy that spans three counties, that is better for the farmers then just protected farms in King County.",32,,
211,0.97,1451.349,1483.248,"There really are benefits to permanently conserving forest land, farmland, River corridors, other natural lands brought the region on a regional scale, not just one County alone and this legislation would open the door to Pierce and Snohomish County to share in some of the conservation benefits King County has enjoyed for this partnership to Mr. questions, that was the point I wanted to make in addition to what I said at the meeting on Wednesday.",32,,
212,0.97,1483.248,1485.483,I urge your support for this legislation of King County.,32,,
213,0.97,1485.483,1486.484,"Thank you, Michael.",33,,
214,0.97,1486.484,1490.589,"Bfore we hear from Steve, I understand you may have a map to visually describe what you said.",33,,
215,0.97,1490.589,1506.872,Sure . I will show a property map that is on the Kane County Website that you can get there by going to Kane County.Gov/Tdr looking for the property map.,34,,
216,0.97,1506.872,1511.109,"What is showing on my screen right now, are you saying?",34,,
217,0.97,1511.109,1511.776,Yes.,35,,
218,0.97,1511.776,1514.379,Very good.,36,,
219,0.97,1514.379,1521.353,The green dots are the sights throughout King County permanently protected.,36,,
220,0.97,1521.353,1527.292,"Each represents a property, some of which are many parcels and some are single parcel.",36,,
221,0.97,1527.292,1535.7,This shade of green are the Polygons representing the land permanently protected so you can see major forest blocks.,36,,
222,0.97,1535.7,1543.842,"Is of the Snoqualmie forest, if I had my shades drawn up right now I could see out my window and look at this.",36,,
223,0.97,1543.842,1545.71,These are the headwaters of the green River down here.,36,,
224,0.97,1545.71,1564.329,"When you Scroll in to the family in the Snoqualmie Valley, you can see individual farms we have permanently protected many of the deals of the conservation acquisitions shown on the map are driven by demand for transferable development rights from Seattle developers.",36,,
225,0.97,1564.329,1574.139,"The Orange dots on the map are where the transferable development rights have landed, where they have been used.",36,,
226,0.97,1574.139,1582.881,You can see a cluster in downtown at South Lake Union which is the areas of Seattle where King County transferable development rights can be used.,36,,
227,0.97,1582.881,1591.356,And a Smattering of sites in other jurisdictions and Unincorporated urban King County areas.,36,,
228,0.97,1591.356,1597.562,"This map is available for any to see it is interactive, click on any DOT and learn more attributes.",36,,
229,0.97,1597.562,1604.302,"The point is, this is a very powerful tool for conservation in the region.",36,,
230,0.97,1604.302,1606.304,And we urge your support for this.,36,,
231,0.97,1606.304,1611.409,It can accrue to Pierce and Snohomish County as well.,36,,
232,0.97,1611.409,1612.21,Thank you.,37,,
233,0.97,1612.21,1621.619,This map really does demonstrate how different Eastern King County's and tracks with Snohomish County as opposed to Western County.,37,,
234,0.97,1621.619,1638.703,"As I said on Wednesday, when we looked out at the mountains from Seattle or drive up to index or mt . Rainier, if we want to continue driving through forest and farmland rather than looking at continued expansion of development that is not dense, we need to use this program.",37,,
235,0.97,1638.703,1641.806,Thank you.,37,,
236,0.97,1641.806,1644.409,I will stop sharing now if that sounds good.,38,,
237,0.97,1644.409,1646.244,Very good.,38,,
238,0.97,1646.244,1658.957,"Steve, please, we are quite excited to have you and thank you for being here . earlier this year, I met with County executive Dave summers to discuss the need for regional Tdr program.",39,,
239,0.97,1658.957,1664.129,Can you share a little bit about how Snohomish County could benefit from the change?,39,,
240,0.97,1664.129,1667.165,Thank you.,40,,
241,0.97,1667.165,1673.838,I've been involved with the program since its inception back in 2013.,40,,
242,0.97,1673.838,1695.593,"We had worked over the years in terms trying to draft legislation, both policy and implementing code so we had this program that is sorted in its infancy compared to King County, King County had successful Tdr program for many decades.",40,,
243,0.97,1695.593,1711.609,We hope to catch up somewhat to what Kane County success has been . We have only currently couple hundred acres or so of land set aside through conservation and Tdr program.,40,,
244,0.97,1711.609,1723.922,"What we have in Snohomish County, we don't have Tdr receiving area engine light like there is down here with the city of Seattle and King County.",40,,
245,0.97,1723.922,1747.912,A few cities in Snohomish County have adopted the type of Tdr legislation and we work with them but there has not been real demand I developers to purchase any of the TR credits from our land areas in Coasta Thomas County.,40,,
246,0.97,1747.912,1756.054,"The county does have, receiving areas and urban Unincorporated Snohomish County.",40,,
247,0.97,1756.054,1761.159,Those areas are limited and we had a little success there.,40,,
248,0.97,1761.159,1772.67,The county is really supportive of the passing of this legislation here so we can enter into transferring those credits to the city of Seattle.,40,,
249,0.97,1772.67,1793.925,"I should mention as part of the authorized legislation back in 2013, the county did adopt by reference that section of Washington administrative code to allow for, transfer those development rights with how having to enter heavy local agreements.",40,,
250,0.97,1793.925,1801.866,We are set up on our end for sending those Tdr credits once demand becomes available and is Seattle.,40,,
251,0.97,1801.866,1826.724,"I should mention our Tdr sending areas, designated farms and forest lands on our comprehensive plan maps, we have several thousand, hundreds of thousands of acres of forest land but very finite amount of designated farmland, about 56,000 acres currently.",40,,
252,0.97,1826.724,1836.034,"That agricultural land generates, this was a couple years ago, $139 million toward the county economy.",40,,
253,0.97,1836.034,1859.224,Not only will this legislation help serve and Renters the conversion of farmland in our County for obviously there is open space attributes but it really is a key part of our economy from the county there.,40,,
254,0.97,1859.224,1878.376,We certainly would like to see that agricultural economy enhanced and grow and hopefully participation by the city of Seattle and regional Tdr program will help us with that.,40,,
255,0.97,1878.376,1879.444,"Very well said, Steve.",41,,
256,0.97,1879.444,1901.499,"I think that also demonstrates that network that Michael was talking about about across the Tri-County area, as I was just saying, Eastern County versus Western County has two distinct environments to it and making sure there is good North/South Connectivity from Snohomish down to King County is critical for that economy to thrive.",41,,
257,0.97,1901.499,1917.081,"Yeah, in fact we have fiscal connections, the Samish valley as you drive up I-5, portion of that Valley, the Snoqualmie river valley, we have a portion of that in our County.",42,,
258,0.97,1917.081,1921.119,That certainly extends out to King County.,42,,
259,0.97,1921.119,1939.337,"You can easily see what preservation of farmland can do to our environment and overall, providing preservation of open space which is critical in our region.",42,,
260,0.97,1939.337,1940.438,"Very well said, Stephen.",43,,
261,0.97,1940.438,1958.556,"Pierce County unable to send it representative due to scheduling constraints, my stuff opened their Tdr staff and it is my understanding Pierce County is supportive of this change and working to implement regional Tdr themselves.",43,,
262,0.97,1958.556,1962.66,"Colleagues, at this time, I want to double check if there are questions for Steve, Michael, or Ketil Freeman.",43,,
263,0.97,1962.66,1973.271,"I know we just have this before us, 48 hours, two days ago so I'm seeing no questions.",43,,

284,0.97,2074.072,2076.774,It appeared on the Council comprehensive plan amendment docket every year since 2019.,49,,
285,0.97,2076.774,2094.759,"As I have shared seriously, proposing residential name change for the simple fact most accurately reflects the reality of today, the neighborhoods we call single-family include much more than single-family homes.",49,,

294,0.97,2156.02,2163.361,I know I asked the question every time it comes up because the chief concern I've heard is a concern that does more than a simple name change.,51,,
295,0.97,2163.361,2175.273,"I know, I have asked this before, can you confirm this amendment only changes the name of single-family areas and does not change what is allowed to be do in these areas?",51,,

523,0.97,3779.375,3785.348,This plan starts with Articulating what our goals are for community engagement.,120,,
524,0.97,3785.348,3806.669,We are very cognizant of the high expectations community has for meaningful and deep and broad and equitable engagement related to this plant and we know we both have a citywide scope as well as neighborhood level to reach people in meaningful and interactive ways.,120,,
525,0.97,3806.669,3820.216,"We are centering our effort around race and equity, or Tasing marginalized communities both in terms of hearing from them, engaging with them on this bill and having capacity for engagement over the long- term.",120,,

528,0.97,3852.648,3873.569,"This meaningful engagement is not only about providing information to communities and the public but really it is about interaction, dialogue and a plan that meets our goals and guys going for and to be truly transparent and responsive to the outside.",120,,

530,0.97,3883.045,3914.076,"First and foremost centering race and equity in the effort, we are Prioritizing limited resources to engage with marginalized communities, communities that have not had access and the ability and influence over citywide policymaking in the past resulting in historical and ongoing Harms, specifically Bipoc communities, limited English communities, refugees, immigrant communities, Lgbtq communities, and people with disabilities.",120,,

532,0.97,3926.689,3936.832,This effort will endeavor to do both well keep at the North Star making this equitable and inclusive engagement process.,120,,
533,0.97,3936.832,4029.225,"Specifically with respect to using our resources, and I know is a budget proviso, I'm sure you're interested hearing from us how we intend to use the monies in this year's budget and going into next year, we have a total expected at this point budget of $150,000 for the community engagement specifically over the three years, supplemented by the Opcd staffing we have with long- range planning and communications team . What we intend to do is use $150,000 nearly exclusively to enable equitable engagement and resource organizations and individuals to be part of this planning effort, specifically agreements with Community-Based organizations, to inform the planning effort, and to reach the communities that they serve those are organizations that serve or work with are embedded in particular the marginalized communities, Bipoc and others that we just highlighted working with Department of neighborhoods to bring on a Cohort if you will, a small group of community liaisons who would be working with them directly to Orient them, train them, represent the plan process but also reach the communities they represent and connect with.",120,,
534,0.97,4029.225,4045.141,"Between the Community-Based organization and community liaisons, we endeavor to fill in the gaps to be cognizant of reaching full range of marginalized communities across the city and we are hopeful we will have the resources to be able to do that.",120,,
535,0.97,4045.141,4071.801,"Doing it in a thoughtful way and listening to communities not meeting that objective translation and interpretation is another area we would be putting resources from our budget, not only written form but new and emerging format for reaching Copperheads of plan update.",120,,

539,0.97,4102.398,4107.57,"Before you move on to the next slide, quick question.",121,,
540,0.97,4107.57,4114.944,"I would like to flag $150,000 for three year engagement process for something this important seems like a small budget.",121,,
541,0.97,4114.944,4119.782,I'm interested to know how that plans to pass budgets.,121,,
542,0.97,4119.782,4122.418,Do you have that offhand?,121,,
543,0.97,4122.418,4124.887,"No, at least I have a rough estimate.",122,,
544,0.97,4124.887,4139.001,"It is a bit challenging looking backward to get a precise number from the last conference of plan update, it was Ttenuated process over several years.",122,,
545,0.97,4139.001,4145.341,"This is a smaller budget than the overall expenditures for community engagement during the last update which was in the neighborhood of $225,000- $250,000.",122,,
546,0.97,4145.341,4179.608,"I would also add to that, we understand the expectations of community for the kind of engagement we would be doing, kind of capacity building for marginalized communities, setting a higher bar going into this update that Arguably experienced the last time when Seattle was being developed, less resources and the needs are greater so this will be a challenge.",122,,
547,0.97,4179.608,4179.942,Okay.,123,,
548,0.97,4179.942,4186.582,"I will keep my eyes on this which leads me to general question, maybe I can save it for the end, thinking about it now, how can we as Councilmembers help you?",123,,
549,0.97,4186.582,4200.696,"I think one of the things we will be doing throughout the process is being in communication with you about how it is going and how effective we are, the opportunities for briefing at key junctures and the process.",124,,
550,0.97,4200.696,4209.905,I'm about to go onto a Timeline slide which will give you some ideas to win those major milestones are.,124,,
551,0.97,4209.905,4223.619,"As you just highlighted, the resource question will be important and we may need additional resources to rise to both immunity expectations and what the city wants to achieve making this effort.",124,,
552,0.97,4223.619,4230.526,"I will save my other questions, I see we have been joined by director.",125,,

558,0.97,4255.017,4256.252,"But I know it well, obviously.",126,,
559,0.97,4256.252,4286.882,"I would like to add to the answer to your question though, and I guess I would say what we know is that when this budget was put together, 150,000, it did not contemplate amongst other things compensation of community involvement and the amount of community engagement we now know that we need in this season of change and reconciliation I believe we are in now.",126,,
560,0.97,4286.882,4298.394,It is something I think bears further conversation as we dive into the work in 2022.,126,,
561,0.97,4298.394,4299.662,Important flag and alert.,127,,
562,0.97,4299.662,4304.4,I will save my other questions and maybe Michael will answer them.,127,,

565,0.97,4315.611,4323.118,"Briefly here, I want to focus on the important partnerships and ordination pieces we are taking on.",129,,
566,0.97,4323.118,4343.605,"I mentioned working externally with Community-Based organizations, that is key, one of the key recommendations of the racial equity analysis we presented over the summer from policy, that role of external organizations reaching Bipoc and other marginalized communities.",129,,
567,0.97,4343.605,4358.053,"Internally coordination and partnership with other departments, there are a number of other opportunities . We are blessed, if you will, of their being other similar efforts in other departments.",129,,
568,0.97,4358.053,4368.831,"Most prominently, Department of transportation taking on, what expect broad citywide transportation effort.",129,,
569,0.97,4368.831,4391.72,"Much the same Timeline as a comprehensive and seeking opportunities for joining engagement, joint partnerships with Community-Based organizations, Messaging, bringing people together around unified conversation around the future of the city that covers transportation and variety of issues with the conference of plan.",129,,
570,0.97,4391.72,4400.863,"There are others as well, they share our water project, utilities and others.",129,,
571,0.97,4400.863,4410.072,"As well as Leveraging work Opcd already doing around stationary planning, Edi program, industrial Maritime strategy.",129,,
572,0.97,4410.072,4430.526,We are doing engagement in these other areas and they all plan and we try to leverage that . This approach will be flexible and responsive to the constraints and opportunities for Covid-19 pandemic and engagement hybrid weight in person and Online and try to be nimble through that as we go forward.,129,,
573,0.97,4430.526,4438.2,As well as continuous learning and improvement through the various phases of outreach.,129,,
574,0.97,4438.2,4468.664,"This slide shows very simplified Timeline for the project including major milestones launched this fall, Scoping for Ciba analysis around the middle of next year, draft EIS and draft plan early 2023 and what is anticipated to be final plant transmitted Tech Council and final EIS at the end of 2023 in adoption of June 2024.",129,,
575,0.97,4468.664,4475.571,Roughly coincides with four phases of engagement.,129,,
576,0.97,4475.571,4491.453,"There is a lot of information on the slide, I want to highlight a few important elements of this intended to summarize objectives and activities in each of these four phases.",129,,
577,0.97,4491.453,4494.289,You are most interested in what will happen over the next year.,129,,
578,0.97,4494.289,4528.323,"The first phase, what we call learn and listen roughly between now and the beginning of spring next year, we will raise awareness beginning with citywide discussion establishing internal and external bishops, refining the community engagement plan the information we are giving today will be further refined working with community liaisons, Ceos, commissions, for more public phasing, public participation plan available around the end of the year and initiating racial equity Toolkit.",129,,
579,0.97,4528.323,4564.459,"Specifically, launching our Website with branding and public materials, endeavoring to go truly live with that effort around the end of this year and doing the work with our partners in coordination with Sdot and others to make this more robust effort going into 2022 with commissions, getting the community liaison and CBO contracts in place early this fall so we are hitting the ground running going into the new year.",129,,
580,0.97,4564.459,4622.684,"During the shaping the plan phase in the next year, this is when we engage with general public as well as emphasizing marginalized communities around the growth strategy, that is where and how we plan for housing and jobs over the next 20 to 25 years as well as the gaps and needs in our planned elements, where the policies reside within the plan, banding up interactive web platform for getting the information out and hearing from community about various elements of the plan, communicating what the plan alternatives we will study in EIS look like and what they mean in a way Relatable on a neighborhood scale to different communities using tools such as focus groups, workshops, community meetings that are more interactive conversations around these topics and continuing partnerships around the racial equity Toolkit which I will cover in the next slide to give you a bigger better picture of that.",129,,
581,0.97,4622.684,4639.034,"Briefly, into 2023, that is when we have the Ies draft plan, it really about getting the information out there and hearing people sustain marginalized communities through the latter stages of the work.",129,,
582,0.97,4639.034,4642.27,Always easier to get people excited and engaged at the beginning of a lengthy planning process.,129,,
583,0.97,4642.27,4656.918,Our challenge here will be keeping those communities engaged for when some of the big decisions are made as we move forward of preferred alternative for future growth and the final plan that comes back to you in 2024.,129,,
584,0.97,4656.918,4665.961,"Before we move on to the next slide, I want to check in about these key, are we able to move back one or stuck forward?",130,,
585,0.97,4665.961,4667.262,There we are.,130,,
586,0.97,4667.262,4677.039,Will you be able to come back to Committee at these key milestones you laid out so you can report out to let us know what your already hearing?,130,,
587,0.97,4677.039,4677.439,Yes.,131,,
588,0.97,4677.439,4678.874,I think that is an excellent idea.,131,,
589,0.97,4678.874,4691.753,"One of the things we are already contemplating with regard to community engagement is toward the end of each of these phases, to intentionally ask the question of community and ourselves, how are we doing?",131,,
590,0.97,4691.753,4697.959,"Are we effectively reaching people, what are we hearing?",131,,
591,0.97,4697.959,4701.396,Those would be excellent junctures to come back to Council and also share that information.,131,,
592,0.97,4701.396,4701.997,Thank you.,132,,
593,0.97,4701.997,4714.776,What is the best way for Councilmembers to communicate with you their goals and what they were hearing from community?,132,,
594,0.97,4714.776,4717.079,"Need to circle back with me, I'm happy to follow up Off- line.",132,,
595,0.97,4717.079,4749.044,"I think that is a lengthy, clearly these kinds of opportunities to come to Council certainly going into, there may be opportunity for the Council to consider what your goals are for the process through resolution or other formats going as we are launching this effort in the next year, certainly other ways and I would be happy to meet with Councilmembers to share those conversations as we going along, especially looking at these phases and where you are.",133,,
596,0.97,4749.044,4749.945,Great.,134,,
597,0.97,4749.945,4759.254,Let's definitely create clear parameters and channels because the last thing I want to do is start sending resolutions every week or doing kind of piecemeal.,134,,
598,0.97,4759.254,4768.864,I would like to give my colleagues a very clear channel of engagement so we can focus that.,134,,
599,0.97,4768.864,4771.933,We are certainly available to engage with Council in a variety of modes.,135,,
600,0.97,4771.933,4774.169,We will talk off-line about that for sure.,135,,
601,0.97,4774.169,4777.672,Director Strauss.,135,,
602,0.97,4777.672,4782.077,"Yes, Councilmember Strauss, I think that is a great idea.",136,,
603,0.97,4782.077,4815.61,"I think as we lay out in 2022 what our engagement plan is for reaching out to Stakeholders and Ceos, identifying the milestones we are coming back to the Council to report out and also hear what you are hearing, I think that is really important, I also think you have a really good idea of people and organizations you know we need to be talking with so we really want that feedback as well.",136,,
604,0.97,4815.61,4823.118,", to inform the plan.",136,,
605,0.97,4823.118,4823.785,Exactly.,137,,

609,0.97,4829.791,4838.233,"It summarizes what we anticipate in terms of the process, maps under this planning effort.",138,,
610,0.97,4838.233,4863.859,"It is based on the steps developed by the office of civil rights a number of years ago for racial equity Toolkits but it is tailored to the kind of questions and activities and framework you would be using to develop really robust process, essentially starting now, meaningfully started with racial equity analysis we developed and brought to this Committee this past summer.",138,,
611,0.97,4863.859,4871.666,It is grounded in involvement with Stakeholders which really threads throughout the other steps.,138,,
612,0.97,4871.666,4884.679,We are working with the Edi advisory board for oversight and as a working group for key junctures in the process and providing for the continuity throughout the process.,138,,
613,0.97,4884.679,4913.508,"The focus on marginalized communities through General outreach, what we are doing with Edi advisory board and staff and working closely with Department neighborhoods and office of civil rights is to develop a set of questions and topics, the kind of dialogue with community that relate to each of the steps that you see here.",138,,
614,0.97,4913.508,4933.929,"The process becomes harder with community engagement, it is informed by data . We have a wealth of data summarized in the racial equity analysis report and equitable monitoring report which is ongoing body of work, we have a set of Dashboards and other data on the Website.",138,,
615,0.97,4933.929,4965.126,"It is a great starting point for considering some of the core questions, we will be updating the risk and opportunity mapping which were instrumental in the last planning, planning update effort as well as background report which establishes a story weaving in data and Messaging around what is an issue in the plan, very much grounded in race and equity and dialogue going forward.",138,,
616,0.97,4965.126,4973.768,"We hope it is an excellent resource for this effort, we expect the background report to be available around the end of this year as well.",138,,
617,0.97,4973.768,4982.711,This process will define outcomes for the update that address racial disparities that are evident in the data we are hearing from community.,138,,
618,0.97,4982.711,4999.961,"The outcomes will be documented early in the process so when we get to the end of the process with the final plan going to Council, we can answer the question as to whether we have addressed those outcomes and are moving in the right direction.",138,,
619,0.97,4999.961,5031.626,The outcomes will endeavor to maximize the benefits for Bipoc and other marginalized communities and advance opportunities and minimize harm . We see this as being very essential conversation around how we are advancing growth strategy not only housing but jobs as well as identifying gaps in our policy elements.,138,,
620,0.97,5031.626,5045.54,We will work with the Edi advisory board very closely to highlight that material going forward and producing a report that will be part of what goes to Council later in the process as well as integrating equity analysis into our environmental policy.,138,,
621,0.97,5045.54,5048.61,That is a very high level summary of the Red process.,138,,
622,0.97,5048.61,5055.95,Happy to come back to Council and talk in more details as we go through each phase of work.,138,,
623,0.97,5055.95,5064.526,It is unlike the last update we are starting very intentionally at the beginning of the process and carrying it through until the end.,138,,
624,0.97,5064.526,5067.128,"Thank you, Michael.",139,,
625,0.97,5067.128,5085.847,"With that, any further questions? We hope you agree this has given you a good picture of what we plan to do, how we plan to use the budget resources that can satisfy the proviso and we can get to work.",140,,
626,0.97,5085.847,5086.247,Great.,141,,
627,0.97,5086.247,5086.881,"Thank you, Michael.",141,,
628,0.97,5086.881,5094.923,"On the question that has come up since it during the presentation, at this time, many members of the public now think about geography of the city in terms of city council districts.",141,,
629,0.97,5094.923,5107.101,Have you already anticipated that relationship between citywide level outreach and the Council districts which are I guess in some ways intermediate level of geography?,141,,
630,0.97,5107.101,5117.912,We had not worked the Council district geography explicit we planning for community engagement.,142,,
631,0.97,5117.912,5120.782,Suffice it to say we know we need to reach all areas of the city.,142,,
632,0.97,5120.782,5137.031,"Essentially all of the districts in very meaningful way and something to be cognizant of going forward and feedback from, certainly a piece of feedback from Councilmembers, we want to make sure we are reaching the people that reside in your districts.",142,,
633,0.97,5137.031,5144.539,"If we are not doing that well, we want to hear about it.",142,,
634,0.97,5144.539,5148.877,"Maybe that is, when you provide the parameters of how we best funnel feedback to you, that intermediate geography level.",143,,
635,0.97,5148.877,5157.152,I can see director Rico Quirindongo.,143,,
636,0.97,5157.152,5162.957,"The last question of the day, desire to hear a little bit more about what the neighborhood level outreach looks like.",143,,
637,0.97,5162.957,5172.367,I think that neighborhood level outreach is a plan we still need to put in place.,144,,
638,0.97,5172.367,5185.58,"When I say that, having come from a community base background myself, we need to put together a plan which outlines, what is our vision, mission, and goals for the outreach process?",144,,
639,0.97,5185.58,5223.051,"A very literal about who it is we are trying to engage, what organizations, which Stakeholders, what groups, what is the process we are going to engage to do that and what are the intended outcomes in the sense as we got to the community, people have a clear understanding of given your input, how does that translate into what you will see in the plant and how was that implemented by the city and by community after a plan has been completed?",144,,
640,0.97,5223.051,5238.733,That is actually a lot of work which is what we will jump into to begin to start to outline that once we have proviso left and started down that road with consultant and work internal to the office.,144,,
641,0.97,5238.733,5261.556,"I think to your earlier point about districts, I think the very intentional work we want to do with Councilmembers his identification of both issues in each of your districts and individuals and organizations you know need to be tied into the conversation as a process.",144,,
642,0.97,5261.556,5297.158,"I think different from matt, the lines drawn in the plan are lines like the area plans we also know we need to do, planning effort before, that is a different effort not explicitly outlined in the initial Scoping of the process that was adopted by the regional Council in 2018 so that his work we need to jump into in 22 need to as well.",144,,
643,0.97,5297.158,5322.216,There are different things I think we need to make sure in the process we are both looking at outcomes related to each of your districts and outcomes related to any of a number of neighborhoods and also outcomes related to the area plans we need to start to process for as well.,144,,
644,0.97,5322.216,5323.618,I hope that helps.,144,,
645,0.97,5323.618,5324.319,Well said.,145,,

650,0.97,5337.999,5339.333,I'm seeing none.,147,,
651,0.97,5339.333,5349.01,I went to thank you both for being with us today and we look forward to continuing to work closely as we get ready to shape the major update in 2024.,147,,

670,0.97,5452.914,5472.466,"And Rico Quirindongo six will provide updates . for the management plan, today we are proud to share this work that is culmination of several years of effort, the city urban forest is increasingly important asset.",156,,
671,0.97,5472.466,5487.181,"We've seen particularly this year the devastating effects of extreme heat on our communities and how critical the information is, especially environmental of disparaged communities.",156,,
672,0.97,5487.181,5492.987,Environment helps with heat Evans as they face reduced temperatures in and around homes.,156,,
673,0.97,5492.987,5503.731,This is one example of how critical the urban forest is for our community and why it is important we have effective plan ensuring it is cared for adequately.,156,,
674,0.97,5503.731,5524.719,"To help provide that care and protect this important resource, we have planning document that provides the framework for policy and action that guides city government decision-making to help Seattle maintain, preserve, enhance, and restore its urban forest.",156,,
675,0.97,5524.719,5536.697,Seattle urban forestry functions are organized in integrated approach where the responsibilities for the work are housed in nine departments that conduct the work and the departments work together to develop to ensure effective management of the citywide resource across this.,156,,
676,0.97,5536.697,5542.036,The plan was originally created in 2007 and we strive to update every five years.,156,,
677,0.97,5542.036,5548.643,Differs update took place in 2013 and this is the second update beginning in 2018.,156,,
678,0.97,5548.643,5551.712,Complete in 2020.,156,,
679,0.97,5551.712,5561.522,"We worked this year to finalize the documents, the plant itself and executive summary . As of September 14, there live and Online.",156,,
680,0.97,5561.522,5585.379,"The process to develop the plan was led by the team made up of representatives from seven of the nine departments within urban forestry sponsor abilities which are shown here in this graphic in the top right, administrative services are the two departments involved in more ad hoc manner.",156,,
681,0.97,5585.379,5591.752,Any other departments are the active members and work together developing the plan.,156,,
682,0.97,5591.752,5606.4,"Began by establishing the purpose of the plan, updates for the updated plan to provide that framework for policy and action to guide city government maintain further and enhance and restore the forest.",156,,
683,0.97,5606.4,5617.612,Set of goals and strategies and actions and indicators but died Department staff supporting healthy and sustainable urban forest across Seattle publicly and privately owned lands.,156,,
684,0.97,5617.612,5632.96,"14 members worked with different leadership and teams throughout the plan development process and important to hear from community preparing this update, created engagement plan to reach out to Underrepresented communities.",156,,
685,0.97,5632.96,5651.946,We carried out public engagement in two phases with initial outreach focusing on Bipoc immunities as well as other key Stakeholders in 2018 and 2019 prior to putting pen to paper and with the initial input received created first draft of the plan.,156,,
686,0.97,5651.946,5663.624,The second phase included engagement with and feedback from the urban forestry Commission as well as sharing the draft plan with the community and other key Stakeholders.,156,,
687,0.97,5663.624,5677.371,"We also reached out to session participants in Community-Based organizations that supported Bipoc engagement in phase one to make sure we incorporated input into the goals, strategies, and actions.",156,,
688,0.97,5677.371,5692.086,"Once all of this input was summarized and considered and changes incorporated into the plan, the team introduced a simple checklist as is customary with plans such as this management plan.",156,,
689,0.97,5692.086,5702.496,Sdci issue determination which was out for public comment in March and April 2020 and there is no appeal to that finding.,156,,
690,0.97,5702.496,5712.673,Once the secret process was finalized we gain mayoral approval to have the election and release it and today it is our pleasure to return the plan.,156,,
691,0.97,5712.673,5718.612,The plan is posted Online on the trees for Seattle Website.,156,,
692,0.97,5718.612,5720.715,We will cover some of the highlights of it here.,156,,
693,0.97,5720.715,5731.659,The plan overall covers the current status of the urban forest and details on the existing management approach and it includes details that frame and guide our forest management.,156,,
694,0.97,5731.659,5744.138,"To start with, the plan covers Seattle urban resource . It describes management units as organizing Rentable of the plan canopy cover goals.",156,,
695,0.97,5744.138,5754.181,"It acknowledges the different type of trees based on land ownership, private, public, Right-Of-Way which has the trees.",156,,
696,0.97,5754.181,5758.419,Public land has full responsibility renting and maintaining trees.,156,,
697,0.97,5758.419,5765.76,"On private land, our role is limited and is focused, instead of supporting Treeplanting and enforcing relations governing trees.",156,,
698,0.97,5765.76,5782.943,The plan also covers how the 2016 canopy cover assessment informs what we know of the urban forest status as well as other assessments and inventory efforts such as efforts to complete inventory of all Street trees in the city.,156,,
699,0.97,5782.943,5807.902,"But also list the challenges to the urban trees that impact how we can best manage them including establishment and maintenance cost, uses, urban design, soils . I mentioned the management units are the organizing principle of the plant canopy cover goals.",156,,
700,0.97,5807.902,5812.406,"I want to spend a minute on those, this is a similar framework to the 2013 plan update.",156,,
701,0.97,5812.406,5822.116,It acknowledges properties are very different across the city and the urban forest cannot be viewed as a single unit for management purposes.,156,,
702,0.97,5822.116,5834.929,The plan defines these nine units corresponding with the types and layers to be coordinated . These unit types include eight areas based on physical characteristics and the Right-Of-Way runs throughout the other eight.,156,,
703,0.97,5834.929,5846.207,The plan is on the mat that illustrates the graphic throughout the city.,156,,
704,0.97,5846.207,5851.946,I will give a couple examples of how we manage trees differently in different Manaement units to illustrate how these units contribute to organizing urban forestry work.,156,,
705,0.97,5851.946,5861.355,"In natural areas, we focus on basic plans and installation of plants to ensure Understory.",156,,
706,0.97,5861.355,5882.476,"These are management areas where water and carbon reduction are the greatest given the size of these forest patches whereas in Right-Of-Way, we focus on replanting trees that increase shade and focus on environments that receive Pollutants and has limited soil and space.",156,,
707,0.97,5882.476,5903.697,"These areas, tree management is partnership between Sdot and adjacent property owners were Sdot you with all Street trees, provides information for landowners regarding appropriate tree types and tree care and maintains 16% of trees well property owners are responsible for maintaining trees.",156,,
708,0.97,5903.697,5913.908,"The plan also covers our city government currently manages this resources, it summarizes the roles in departments that support and maintain urban forest.",156,,
709,0.97,5913.908,5936.397,"It describes existing plans, policies and programs that have intersections with and help inform the city urban forestry network like the recent social justice initiative what helps guide the framework for more equitable outcomes, the action plan that helps outline urban forestry fits into the main of communities.",156,,
710,0.97,5936.397,5944.138,"Pedestrian master plan, housing Affordability, trees first reality for Seattle and the Seattle partnership program.",156,,
711,0.97,5944.138,5976.07,"Describes the city management of Street and public trees and list regulations governing trees on public property fight Seattle municipal code 2511 that relates tree removal outside the limits and during development process as well as listing incentives for planting in preservation of trees such as development standards, departures, or applicants may apply for for purchase from development standards to preserve existing tree during development.",156,,
712,0.97,5976.07,5984.979,The plan dives into the outcomes and strategies to be used guiding city urban forestry work in the next five years.,156,,
713,0.97,5984.979,5991.552,The team developed a set of diverse comprehensive goals or outcomes to guide our urban forestry work.,156,,
714,0.97,5991.552,5994.588,Those are seen on the left.,156,,
715,0.97,5994.588,6006.4,These are what we aim to accomplish managing this asset and reflect update to urban forest management . including increased emphasis on racial and social equity.,156,,
716,0.97,6006.4,6017.911,"And then in order to achieve the outcomes, the team confirmed seven different strategies that represent competence of approach to mobilizing effective action.",156,,
717,0.97,6017.911,6036.33,Some of these strategies are consistent and carried over from the 2013 plan update and two new strategies added to focus on the needs of the environmental justice 40 communities and address the need for impact like climate change.,156,,
718,0.97,6036.33,6045.205,These strategies were used to develop specific actions that formed the action agenda through which the plan will be implemented in urban forest managed.,156,,
719,0.97,6045.205,6054.982,This action agenda outlines the steps the city and community partners will take to implement the plan and through which we aim to ensure urban forest is effectively managed.,156,,
720,0.97,6054.982,6066.96,This is a more concise action agenda than previous plans in order to be targeted and effective in planning . The plan does not include details for implementing actions.,156,,
721,0.97,6066.96,6071.265,Those details are contained in Department work plans.,156,,
722,0.97,6071.265,6084.745,"Does not include work performed ongoing by city departments such as planting trees and complying with the cheaper ones, tree replacement policy and management of properties.",156,,
723,0.97,6084.745,6092.686,That work is already ongoing and the action agenda aims to focus on actions that advance work beyond those ongoing actions.,156,,
724,0.97,6092.686,6112.673,"There are 19 actions and they are organized within the strategies and within the list, the team identified actions that are priorities due to their importance managing the urban forest and supporting and responding to community concerns.",156,,
725,0.97,6112.673,6115.576,The actions that are Bolded are those priority actions.,156,,
726,0.97,6115.576,6148.242,"This Prioritization reflects input provided by Bipoc immunities, key Stakeholders, and public, process with the public at large, this slide shows action to the first four strategies, this plan update includes focus on the needs of Bipoc communities with the order of the strategies and concentration of priority actions in the strategies focused on Bipoc communities.",156,,
727,0.97,6148.242,6150.11,Here are the remaining three strategies and associated actions.,156,,
728,0.97,6150.11,6156.25,Noticed that updating the tree protection regulations is another priority action.,156,,
729,0.97,6156.25,6163.157,Chanda Emery will provide updates on what is ongoing with that action.,156,,
730,0.97,6163.157,6176.57,"Before I handed over to Chanda to go into the updates on tree protection regulations, I will pause Fr any questions on the plant and its process and content before we go to tree protection updates.",156,,
731,0.97,6176.57,6178.672,"Thank you, Patty.",157,,
732,0.97,6178.672,6179.339,Great presentation.,157,,
733,0.97,6179.339,6188.282,"I appreciate all of your work I have one question, colleagues, if you have questions, this would be the time.",157,,
734,0.97,6188.282,6201.495,"My question for this slide and previous slide, or these strategies, for instance, citywide canopy cover assessment and urban forestry jobs program, are these programs already funded or do they need to be identified in the city budget for funding at this time?",157,,
735,0.97,6201.495,6211.438,These were items that have existing funding within program departments.,158,,
736,0.97,6211.438,6213.373,"Okay, thank you.",159,,
737,0.97,6213.373,6220.213,"Colleagues, for the urban forestry management plan, are there questions at this time?",160,,
738,0.97,6220.213,6222.115,I'm seeing no questions.,160,,
739,0.97,6222.115,6227.421,"Is a member Pederson, there you are.",160,,
740,0.97,6227.421,6228.088,Taken away.,160,,
741,0.97,6228.088,6231.725,"Thank you, chair Strauss and director for this presentation.",161,,
742,0.97,6231.725,6258.852,"Is there anything in here about, you mentioned the many departments that oversee the tree regulations, is there any mention of forest management plan about consolidating that under one agency? I can see coordinating communication but --",161,,
743,0.97,6258.852,6262.256,That was not covered in this management plan.,162,,
744,0.97,6262.256,6263.256,Okay.,163,,
745,0.97,6263.256,6266.36,Yeah.,164,,
746,0.97,6266.36,6281.441,"Because the action agenda includes items that are Near- term, work that is agreed upon the urban forestry teams, needs to move forward.",164,,
747,0.97,6281.441,6299.793,There is a strategy here for coordinating communication and we always aim to continue to improve the coordination of the forestry work across the departments because we do have integrated approach where the functions live within those nine different departments.,164,,
748,0.97,6299.793,6313.707,"And as we continue that work to increase that coordination, the structure and function of those of how that is distributed could evolve.",164,,
749,0.97,6313.707,6316.376,Thank you.,165,,
750,0.97,6316.376,6342.135,There was a statement of legislative intent adopted by the Council last fall that asked for looking at different models for how to manage tree protections and we did receive a response to that but it was a little bit lacking because it said we might need to hire a consultant into looking into what to do.,165,,
751,0.97,6342.135,6357.217,"But I think looking, there are other cities that have it under one Department or have it chief Arborist that helps to make the tougher decisions on whether to take down exceptional trees.",165,,
752,0.97,6357.217,6366.76,"Something I'm interested in doing more research on, big body.",165,,
753,0.97,6366.76,6374.167,"It is a big body of work, focus our efforts to evaluate that.",166,,
754,0.97,6374.167,6381.308,"Colleagues, any other questions at this time? Patty, amazing job.",167,,
755,0.97,6381.308,6384.678,Thank you.,168,,
756,0.97,6384.678,6385.278,Thank you.,169,,
757,0.97,6385.278,6392.786,"Yeah, I will be here if questions, on the management plan.",169,,
758,0.97,6392.786,6395.288,Chanda will go into details on the tree protection.,169,,
759,0.97,6395.288,6399.593,"Welcome, Chanda take it away.",170,,
760,0.97,6399.593,6402.896,Spent on happy to provide update on tree protections.,170,,
761,0.97,6402.896,6410.904,"For a talk about the slide, I want to give a quick overview at this time right now, actions this quarter are on track and under way.",170,,
762,0.97,6410.904,6417.01,Our team is concluding the outreach and is on target to issue the decision by the end of the year.,170,,
763,0.97,6417.01,6429.689,I would like to cover the Timeline in more detail at the end of the presentation so I'm going to start here with our next slide which is outreach.,170,,
764,0.97,6429.689,6442.936,"As you recall from the last briefing, July 14, public average included two parallel outreach processes to hear from community on tree protection updates.",170,,
765,0.97,6442.936,6467.861,"One of those processes was to hear from the focus groups so our team facilitated a number of listening sessions through the months of July and August and participants included homeowners, builders, environmental groups, community organizations, tree service providers, and that would be like landscape companies and real estate agents.",170,,
766,0.97,6467.861,6477.37,Participation was thoughtful and constructive with approximately 2 to 9 participants in each group.,170,,
767,0.97,6477.37,6480.674,These structured conversations allowed for focused feedback and group conversation.,170,,
768,0.97,6480.674,6492.686,This approach a for participants to share individual experiences as well as engage in conversation with each other and feedback loop.,170,,
769,0.97,6492.686,6510.737,"Now our team currently in the process of reviewing that feedback to identify key themes, key topics we heard across all groups and after that, we will prepare a summary report to be posted on the Sdci Website to be posted in the next couple weeks.",170,,
770,0.97,6510.737,6512.606,Next slide please.,170,,
771,0.97,6512.606,6520.347,The other outreach process is hearing from Bipoc communities and other Underrepresented communities.,170,,
772,0.97,6520.347,6523.083,Outing working with the Department neighborhoods to do this.,170,,
773,0.97,6523.083,6539.633,"Since we last reported, Sdci and ose thanked the Department of community liaisons to do the work and we conducted and completed orientations which was necessary to prepare for them for the next steps.",170,,
774,0.97,6539.633,6545.939,"Part of it included preparing and translating outreach materials in multiple languages like Somalis, Chinese, Spanish.",170,,
775,0.97,6545.939,6566.259,We are very careful to make sure every step throughout the way of the outreach process we are centering Bipoc voices and really being fully aware of all things necessary to tailor engagement to communities we are serving because it is of the utmost importance that we hear from everyone.,170,,
776,0.97,6566.259,6574.568,"Right now, our team of community liaisons are active and out in the communities collecting information in language and using culturally improvement Methodologies tailored for the populations they are serving.",170,,
777,0.97,6574.568,6583.777,We expect to receive a lot of really valuable feedback we will tie together with the feedback we already received from the Online listening sessions.,170,,
778,0.97,6583.777,6611.204,One NOTE to the work with the community liaisons is that we are working with the same cl's we reached out to for that community urban enforcement plan update which helps increase efficiency and not only starting from scratch but also orienting these folks but also contributes to the request from these communities over the years to continue to be engaged in the city tree work.,170,,
779,0.97,6611.204,6629.222,"We are on track to receive the summary reports from the community liaisons as early as October and once we receive those reports, our team will post all of that information Online as soon as we get it October or the first week of November at the latest.",170,,
780,0.97,6629.222,6631.625,Next slide.,170,,
781,0.97,6631.625,6639.632,This slide summarizes the four topic areas we are covering in the outreach process.,170,,
782,0.97,6639.632,6661.554,"We will receive feedback on protecting exceptional trees, expanding the definition of exceptional trees, creating a new definition for significant trees, establishing a tree removal permit system, developing and implementing voluntary payment in lieu alternatives, and exploring tree service provider registration program.",170,,
783,0.97,6661.554,6684.477,"Before we move on, the Arborist qualifications and registrations, this is a bill very similar to what proposal Councilmember Pederson, a piece of legislation I am supportive of, quite frankly I think it is a good idea, I will be very curious to see the outcome of this public engagement.",171,,
784,0.97,6684.477,6707.0,"And hopefully, that can help us inform the bill, you know, kind of speak plainly, if we are able to receive the tree ordinance as you mentioned in the slide just a minute ago, to have that Sepa beginning by the end of the year, I will save my commentary about that for just a minute.",171,,
785,0.97,6707.0,6717.811,"If you are able to transmit the spell, I think hopefully will be able to wrap up Councilmember Pederson's process and about.",171,,
786,0.97,6717.811,6720.747,"I guess I'm speaking a lot for you, do you want to say anything?",171,,
787,0.97,6720.747,6722.916,I want to say I'm supporting your concept.,171,,
788,0.97,6722.916,6724.684,Maybe I will put it that way.,171,,
789,0.97,6724.684,6728.221,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",172,,
790,0.97,6728.221,6729.022,Yes.,172,,
791,0.97,6729.022,6747.207,"You know, we are looking forward to the comprehensive tree protection ordinance which we will talk about later here, I'm glad to know there is common ground on the need to qualify Arborists and register them to increase transparency and accountability.",172,,
792,0.97,6747.207,6759.152,"Of course, that is a modest but necessary step forward and with so many other things here like on this slide about protecting exceptional trees.",172,,
793,0.97,6759.152,6764.557,"Thank you for indicating your support for the concept, I appreciate it.",172,,
794,0.97,6764.557,6768.661,Next slide please.,173,,
795,0.97,6768.661,6783.943,This slide kind of covers the additional staff Sdci hired earlier this year that allowed our analysts to make entering tree related data into the system.,173,,
796,0.97,6783.943,6799.259,"This work supporting staff to monitor canopy coverage and also support Data-Driven decisions . For code complaint, we continue to levy penalties ranging from 10,000 to 99,000 under triple penalty for illegal tree removal.",173,,
797,0.97,6799.259,6809.135,It is language that Sdci added with the director role to clarify willful and malicious cutting warrants malicious cutting.,173,,
798,0.97,6809.135,6816.609,I want to call out this slide is a little out of date.,173,,
799,0.97,6816.609,6818.278,We submitted slides for approval by the Mayor's office.,173,,
800,0.97,6818.278,6825.118,"Over the weekend, we received a large penalty in the amount of 20,572 for damage to exceptional each tree.",173,,
801,0.97,6825.118,6833.526,"The correction on the site should be 66,696 or approximately 70,000 rather than 38,124 to date for that provision.",173,,
802,0.97,6833.526,6835.929,That is really excellent.,174,,
803,0.97,6835.929,6837.43,Thanks.,174,,
804,0.97,6837.43,6843.937,Next slide please.,175,,
805,0.97,6843.937,6868.661,"As far as timing, Sdci and ose are concluding outreach and completing racial equity Toolkit analysis and related analysis and in the process of developing initial recommendations . concurrently, taking steps identify and document potential implementation and enforcement needs as we further develop proposal.",175,,
806,0.97,6868.661,6877.47,"We are on target to issue, like I said the Sepa decision before the end of the year.",175,,
807,0.97,6877.47,6893.086,"I guess this is the time for my commentary, I know the outreach and everything you were engaged in is a product of the resolution resolution 31902 which I help author a number of years ago.",176,,
808,0.97,6893.086,6950.243,"Our last committee meeting, you presented, I was very clear and with Mike Podowski, I'm need to see the Sepa work completed by September, I understand in language that it takes a little more time and is incredibly important to do that, nevertheless, when we created that resolution to years ago, we did not foresee the pandemic coming . So my desire would have been we could be at this place sooner, understanding all of those constraints that we will have a new Mayor and a number of months, it is critical to me, the target to issue Sepa decision before the end of the year, what I want to know for the listening public, when that occurs it means there's a draft bill out for public consumption.",176,,
809,0.97,6950.243,6955.815,"My preference is for the Mayor's office to transmit something to us by the end of the year, that is why I wanted Sepa beginning in September.",176,,
810,0.97,6955.815,6964.457,"It does not seem they will be able to transmit us the bill, understanding Sepa may not be completed by the end of the year.",176,,
811,0.97,6964.457,6980.34,"For the listening public, I want to highlight when that Sepa process begins, that means there will be draft bill for public consumption and even if the Mayor's office cannot transmit it, we will be able to take a copy from the public record to continue doing this work going forward.",176,,
812,0.97,6980.34,6998.725,"With that, I request to Sdci and the Mayor's office is to complete Sepa by November, by Thanksgiving so we are able to work together in the last month that",176,,
813,0.97,6998.958,7001.194,Noted,177,,
814,0.97,7001.194,7002.428,", thank you Councilmember.",178,,
815,0.97,7007.233,7007.9,Thank you.,179,,
816,0.97,7007.9,7009.736,"Colleagues, Councilmember Peterson, take it away.",180,,
817,0.97,7015.007,7032.925,"Thank you for setting the table with those expectations and of course, your leadership on 31902 adopted in I think September 2019, so to share the concerns that we do not have a true projected ordinance draft at this time.",181,,
818,0.97,7032.925,7047.54,We were hoping to get it in 2020 and the quarterly reports we get I'm glad they required these reports like the one we are getting here today.,181,,
819,0.97,7047.54,7056.482,When I compare the March to the July to the September quarterly reports the Goalpost seems to be moving further away each time.,181,,
820,0.97,7056.482,7063.99,"There are subtle differences to each one, but the net result is that we still do not have the Ordnance from the Durkin administration.",181,,
821,0.97,7063.99,7113.739,"So, I wanted to Piggyback on the comments I heard during the public comment period, which is I guess to do the analysis, the state of environmental policy analysis would help to have a draft ordinance before us, so even though you are not delivering the Ordnance, delivering it to the Council to act upon, but there is a draft Documentthat is available to inform and even to inform this outreach that you are doing would seem I guess the question for the executive is will you, could you clarify when a draft, a draft ordinance would be available either for the--to help you with outreach or to help with the analysis?",181,,
822,0.97,7117.343,7123.616,I would be happy to answer that.,182,,
823,0.97,7123.616,7128.421,"So, the Ordnance goes together and we are going to work on getting that as soon as possible.",182,,
824,0.97,7132.358,7145.671,"So, you are saying to have a decision before the end of the year but when, I guess what a draft bill be available to review?",183,,
825,0.97,7145.972,7176.669,"The draft bill will go with it so we are working on forming the initial concepts so like I pointed out earlier, the tree service divider registration is one of the strategies that was called out in 31902 and it is also one of the things that we looked at when we were doing the draft directors rule to the tree directors role so a lot of this has already been done.",184,,
826,0.97,7176.669,7182.141,It is a matter of assembling it into a Sepa checklist and ordinance.,184,,
827,0.97,7184.41,7186.045,Thank you for mentioning the directors role.,185,,
828,0.97,7186.045,7193.386,I believe you had issued a directors role last year to protect exceptional trees.,185,,
829,0.97,7193.386,7194.387,Tank you for that draft.,185,,
830,0.97,7194.387,7195.621,When will that be finalized?,185,,
831,0.97,7202.929,7203.696,The draft directors role?,186,,
832,0.97,7203.696,7204.564,I am sorry.,186,,
833,0.97,7204.564,7207.199,Yes.,187,,
834,0.97,7207.199,7218.744,"Right now we have not received direction from the Mayor's office, but the direct Ordnance will come out at the same time that Sepa does, so I think that is the most efficient, fastest manner we can do this.",188,,
835,0.97,7223.749,7266.058,"Maybe I can put this in a different way, which is the directors role that Sdci transferred to the Mayor's office to increase protections needs to have a Sepa checklist or if, and if it is determined that is not significant then, you know, that--that is a decision, or than it would have an environmental impact statement, so to actuate the work that Sdci completed a year ago that has been with the Mayor's office, they need to do Sepa on that work and that is what the Sepa decision will Ntail as well as the ordinance itself.",189,,
836,0.97,7266.058,7300.593,"When that termination of Non- significance or if it is determined to be significant, they have to start the Iis process, that information will then be publicly available to us, so we can then review and refer to the draft ordinance that has been determined to be not significant or that is then determined to be significant, so if we were--and, now Maybe I am back on a limb, so anybody out there that wants to real me back in for what I think is going on here.",189,,
837,0.97,7300.593,7309.568,"Hypothetically, if we were to receive a determination of Non- significance, that bill would be published.",189,,
838,0.97,7309.568,7313.606,At that time there could be appeals and that could extend the Sepa process.,189,,
839,0.97,7313.606,7320.313,If there is not an appeal we could theoretically take this bill up by the end of December.,189,,
840,0.97,7320.313,7333.125,If we were to receive that Sepa checklist in the determination of Non-Significance by Thanksgiving.,189,,
841,0.97,7333.125,7333.926,That is correct.,190,,
842,0.97,7333.926,7337.396,The role would be reviewed with the Ordnance and it would need Sepa review to clarify that.,190,,
843,0.97,7337.396,7338.864,"Yes, that is correct, Councilmember.",190,,
844,0.97,7338.864,7358.117,Once that determination of significance is reached that directors role will be publicly available for us so we can have a copy of it if the bill is unable to be transmitted by this Mayor.,191,,
845,0.97,7358.117,7362.755,"I would like to add that you know, everyone would see this at the same time for fairness.",192,,
846,0.97,7362.755,7370.062,When we issue it we want to make sure everyone SEES what is issued.,192,,
847,0.97,7370.062,7371.964,"So, that is your standard --",192,,
848,0.97,7376.702,7387.58,"Which is why I am so critically serious about receiving that starting Sepa process as soon as possible, hopefully to be completed before Thanksgiving.",193,,
849,0.97,7387.58,7389.815,We would be my strongest desire.,193,,
850,0.97,7391.784,7394.086,"Councilmember Pederson, you have more? no?",193,,
851,0.97,7398.023,7399.558,"Councilmember war is, I see you there.",193,,
852,0.97,7399.558,7402.194,All good?,193,,
853,0.97,7402.194,7402.595,No questions?,193,,
854,0.97,7402.595,7406.499,"Councilmember Lewis, any thoughts, questions?",193,,
855,0.97,7406.732,7412.471,"No, thank you, Mr. chair.",194,,
856,0.97,7412.471,7419.178,"Chanda Emery, Patty I appreciate you coming before us.",195,,
857,0.97,7419.178,7440.366,"I understand the accountability of that resolution to make sure we are progressing are these reports and while I also had made the request to have that Sepa begun or at least begun hopefully completed by now, I understand that you are still on track to have that completed as soon as possible and you will hear me say that I would like to have that completed by Thanksgiving.",195,,
858,0.97,7440.633,7441.434,Thank you.,196,,
859,0.97,7441.667,7441.934,-- holiday.,197,,

863,0.97,7452.545,7467.626,"[Laughter] anyhow, colleagues, if I am seeing no further questions on this report, I think you for your work, Patty, I think you for your work.",199,,
