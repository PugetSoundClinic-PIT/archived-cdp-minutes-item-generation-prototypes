72,0.97,423.623,438.738,This would also create a new budget summary level line to allow city departments to spend from the new fund for the purpose of assisting in the recovery of the Covid-19 pandemic.,29,,
73,0.97,438.738,446.145,"It also gives the executive authority to accept gifts, donations and grants consistent with the purchases of the bond without additional approval by the city council so as to move it forward in a timely manner.",29,,

85,0.97,547.947,568.067,I put forward this amendment because I support the goal of being able to act quickly to deploy resources from private donations or grants as it is possible to provide relief to those in our community who are experiencing the impacts of Covid-19 but at the same time I think it's important to have transparency and oversight in how we are allocating the starters.,33,,
86,0.97,568.067,577.643,"As a counselor it is important that we understand the full picture of dollars going to support various needs such as small business support copied assistant, homeless support and housing so we are able to make informed decisions about other expenditures.",33,,
87,0.97,577.643,593.492,The amendment that is included here in amendment one would require weekly reporting on how these funds are being spent so we are able to maintain proper oversight and enabling expedient direction of these funds to where they need to go in the community as fast as possible.,33,,

98,0.97,658.658,668.768,In the category of emergency housing and homelessness supports added by Councilmember Mosqueda.,38,,

100,0.97,686.585,700.966,This amendment simply ensures that the reporting includes the categories we have identified as allowed categories so we have a clear sense of which needs are being addressed and funded.,38,,

135,0.97,923.322,929.228,They are in dire need of additional support.,61,,

155,0.97,1053.585,1071.37,We need to be clear that in general when a big business gives with a call for atrophy they often get back far more in profits and through favorable political legislation or absence of legislation much more than they donate.,73,,
156,0.97,1071.37,1074.073,They use donations to buy clinical power.,73,,
157,0.97,1074.073,1076.675,Have advocated for a big business tax.,73,,
158,0.97,1076.675,1091.089,Of NOTE doubt that big business will attempt to use her donations to argue they should continue to avoid paying anything in terms of significant taxation.,73,,
159,0.97,1091.089,1093.959,Furthermore Weenie changes statewide and federally.,73,,
160,0.97,1093.959,1111.21,"I think the logistics that have been compiled through economic studies in the past decades, have shown that the Philanthropy does very little to nothing to address quality that has grown ashen white.",73,,

165,0.97,1139.338,1152.284,That is what I am strongly supporting Bernie Sanders to trillion dollar proposal for a bailout of working families and income for working families in this crisis.,73,,
166,0.97,1152.284,1161.527,It is also been noticed statistically that on average workers give a higher percentage of their income to charity and the middle class.,73,,
167,0.97,1161.527,1168.934,Nobody argues over the taxes on workers being lowered because there are to giving charity.,73,,
168,0.97,1168.934,1176.241,I would argue that we need to build a movement that's vigilant about not accepting the argument from big business.,73,,
169,0.97,1176.241,1181.079,Thank you.,74,,
170,0.97,1181.079,1205.404,"I agree with your marks . It seems like every time we talk about progressive taxation were taxation in general, we often times get the philanthropic effort of the business thrown at us as an argument to prevent or minimize taxation or revenue creation tools.",74,,

512,0.97,3723.119,3735.965,"We had to add that letter because we are hearing many people are saying their corporate landlords, they're extending them notices for rent increases starting in the spring.",224,,

528,0.97,3882.178,3899.195,I just wanted to say in the interest of our movement watching facing any idea that the expectation that big banks and mortgage holders and corporate landlords will do the right thing is a recipe for massive Impoverishment of millions of working families.,226,,

542,0.97,3982.878,4003.899,[Indiscernible] a support this resolution of course but most importantly I am committed to building this movement because this is a resolution and it makes a statement but does not by itself enact the suspension of rent and mortgage payments.,226,,
543,0.97,4003.899,4021.117,Is an important step forward but I want movers of the public to understand how we need to keep fighting and we cannot rest on what will be passed today which will be not enough.,226,,

548,0.97,4040.403,4042.638,I am proud to support this resolution today.,228,,
549,0.97,4042.638,4054.617,"I want to first think Councilmember Morales for bringing this forward and Councilmember Strauss, I want to thank you for your amendment to strengthen this.",228,,
550,0.97,4054.617,4064.56,"I think now more than ever in these times, it is critical that people get some assurance around their insurance payments as well.",228,,
551,0.97,4064.56,4073.936,Just to echo the comments that Councilmember Morales made in response to some of the things Councilmember Pedersen said.,228,,
552,0.97,4073.936,4078.007,I think this goes a long way to Assuaging some of the concerns raised by Pedersen.,228,,
553,0.97,4078.007,4094.39,"We just saw on Friday Congress passed a massive bailout for Airlines, lots of industries that are impacted and affected by the uncertainty of the Covid- 19 crisis.",228,,
554,0.97,4094.39,4103.566,The basis an argument for the bailouts are these are companies that have been adversely effective and there's no way they could of planned for a pandemic and what it would've done to them.,228,,
555,0.97,4103.566,4131.961,The exact same argument can be made in support of the Renters and people who have recently entered into mortgages as homeowners who never could've anticipated or planned that when they signed their mortgage or their lease that they would be in a position where they could lose their livelihoods and homes and be in a position where they could not make the rent or mortgage and face the threat of Eviction or foreclosure.,228,,
556,0.97,4131.961,4137.099,"I think it is, they want the same consideration.",228,,
557,0.97,4137.099,4146.442,Even more so the consideration of the government then these big companies that got a massive bailout last Friday.,228,,
558,0.97,4146.442,4196.592,"To speak to Councilmember Pedersen's concerns, they are warranted, in my understanding, correct me on this, there is nothing in this resolution that suggests should the governor or Congress he'd our request that there be support to back up those policies and actions, I think it is very foreseeable that when inevitably there is another relief bill that comes from Congress and we know ultimately be in the summer spring there will be another big relief bill and a big part of it based on the resolution and other resolutions from other cities and governments, Úit could include support for helping cover folks mortgages and people's rent.",228,,
559,0.97,4196.592,4240.636,"Even though it's not specifically enumerated on what the exact policy prescriptions be, that Congress and the governor taken pursue, the point is we are still asking them to put Renters and people with mortgages in a position where they are not going to be expected to come up with the Aggregated debt from this period that they will basically be in line to receive the same kind of consideration that we lend to banks and Airlines at the national level.",228,,
560,0.97,4240.636,4242.504,That we are not lending to working families.,228,,
561,0.97,4242.504,4249.211,"I think it is fully appropriate given the posture of this, let me put it this way.",228,,
562,0.97,4249.211,4262.424,I find it highly unlikely that Congress would or that the state government would put something like this forward without putting some resources behind it to make sure people are whole.,228,,
563,0.97,4262.424,4267.663,I don't have a concern in voting for on that basis.,228,,
564,0.97,4267.663,4290.352,"The only other thing I want to do similar to the exultation's made earlier,, the urgings made by my colleagues earlier, I want to briefly address the general public based on a lot of communications received on this resolution.",228,,
565,0.97,4290.352,4310.105,"I think there is fairly widespread misunderstanding that this resolution will be in of itself freezing payments to mortgages and rent . I want to join my colleagues who have mentioned this already, if you were not in a position to continue to make payments on your rent or mortgage, please do so.",228,,
566,0.97,4310.105,4330.426,"This resolution is not going to immediately provide that relief, relying solely on this resolution is not going to put you in a position where you can get some relief if you fail to pay your rent or mortgage.",228,,
567,0.97,4330.426,4340.002,I just wanted to remind folks if you are in a position continue to do so.,228,,
568,0.97,4340.002,4347.543,. with that I am proud to vote for this resolution and I am urging my colleagues to do the,228,,

573,0.97,4365.961,4366.662,Thank you.,230,,
574,0.97,4366.662,4371.467,I want to follow up with what Councilmember Pedersen said.,230,,
575,0.97,4371.467,4377.172,I also want to share that we all agree and understand the crisis we are in.,230,,
576,0.97,4377.172,4382.444,I really don't want to go into the us and them thing.,230,,
577,0.97,4382.444,4388.15,Can we all be in the end zone at the same time?,230,,
578,0.97,4388.15,4398.894,"The clarification that I have, when I look at the resolution which is four pages long, it talks about the immediate moratorium on residential and commercial mortgage payments and rent.",230,,
579,0.97,4398.894,4400.729,I'm glad count the number Pedersen pointed this out.,230,,
580,0.97,4400.729,4431.226,"When I looked at this resolution and the letter that Councilmember Mosqueda put together, I was inclined to vote yes because there was not a date in there but when you actually read it more thoroughly, I finally printed it, it goes on and one of the lessons is add that no Renter in the nation should be required to pay rent during this emergency or accumulate debt for unpaid rent.",230,,
581,0.97,4431.226,4443.005,"Want to be clear that what we are voting on as a resolution and you are correct it is not a law or ordinance, it means that the Seattle city council is speaking in one voice and that we are resolute to do this.",230,,
582,0.97,4443.005,4463.058,"We are voting, if we vote yes on this, it extends to residential and commercial mortgage payments that not only do we have a moratorium but we also have a forgiveness of all of the debt, is that correct?",230,,
583,0.97,4463.058,4472.367,"That means we have a moratorium during this crisis and whenever this crisis ends, whatever was accumulated, residential and commercial mortgage",230,,
584,0.97,4472.367,4478.74,Reporter: folks will be forgiven of all debt.,231,,
585,0.97,4478.74,4484.847,That is what is happening here.,231,,
586,0.97,4484.847,4492.354,I want to make that clear.,231,,
587,0.97,4492.354,4505.367,"Everyone is not in agreement that we do not want to see a Renter, Homeowner not be burdened with this kind of debt in light of the package that was passed by Congress, we have all been watching the news, we'll get it.",231,,
588,0.97,4505.367,4512.674,Just we have clarification from Councilmember Morales.,231,,
589,0.97,4512.674,4525.821,Is this what we are actually voting on including what Councilmember Strauss amended on the other items that are a moratorium on him forgiven as well?,231,,
590,0.97,4525.821,4531.527,Councilmember Morales would like to answer that question?,232,,
591,0.97,4531.527,4532.728,Sure.,233,,
592,0.97,4532.728,4551.847,"I'm sure we have all heard from tenants, business owners, of talk to several property owners who say I understand that my small business tenets cannot pay rent.",233,,
593,0.97,4551.847,4553.115,They are not bringing in any money.,233,,
594,0.97,4553.115,4555.551,It makes sense to me that they should not be paying rent.,233,,
595,0.97,4555.551,4559.154,I still have a mortgage to pay for what am I supposed to do?,233,,
596,0.97,4559.154,4562.958,That is what this is addressing.,233,,
597,0.97,4562.958,4591.486,"Yes we have not just tenants and residents, we also have commercial property owners and Renters who are in the same boat and this is a way to address the property owners issue, the tenets issue and understanding that deferring payment for three or four months is not going to solve the problem for some of these folks.",233,,
598,0.97,4591.486,4607.703,"The short answer is yes that is what we are calling for this is part of a national organizing movement because this is not just happening in Seattle but across the country, Renters and property owners are trying to figure out how they will pay their bills.",233,,

600,0.97,4619.715,4622.384,The short answer is yes.,233,,
601,0.97,4622.384,4625.187,That is what this resolution is,233,,
602,0.97,4625.187,4628.023,May follow-up?,234,,
603,0.97,4628.023,4634.329,Please Councilmember Juarez.,235,,
604,0.97,4634.329,4666.261,"You're saying a commercial, somebody that owns 20+ units or apartments who also has a mortgage to pay, they do not collect from Renters, we say they own 30 units of rental, is always also going to from a resolution understand that we are Lagering for them as well under this administration to our governor that they to do not have to pay their mortgage to the bank.",236,,
605,0.97,4666.261,4673.168,That is right.,237,,

639,0.97,4809.471,4811.907,I moved to adopt 31942.,263,,
640,0.97,4811.907,4814.042,Is there a second?,263,,
641,0.97,4814.042,4817.779,There is a second.,264,,
642,0.97,4817.779,4823.718,I will hand it over to Councilmember Herbold as lead sponsor of this resolution to address the resolution.,265,,
643,0.97,4823.718,4825.52,The floor is yours.,265,,
644,0.97,4825.52,4827.489,Think it's much.,266,,
645,0.97,4827.489,4840.735,"This resolution would place the West Seattle bridge onto the capital improvement program Watchlist, just some general points.",266,,
646,0.97,4840.735,4868.93,As you know the Council has a Watchlist that we approve every year and we create a yearly Watchlist by resolution . Just last month they approved resolution 31931 sponsored by Councilmember Mosqueda to adopt the 2020 capital projects Watchlist for projects requiring quarterly enhanced reporting.,266,,
647,0.97,4868.93,4883.979,In 2018 the Council adopted legislation to establish this enhanced reporting which includes his quarterly updates on all individual projects that Úare on the Watchlist itself as well as ongoing programs.,266,,

649,0.97,4888.016,4900.295,It does so in light of the fact they announced the closure of the West Seattle bridge due to the public safety threat due to cracks that were expanding rapidly.,266,,
650,0.97,4900.295,4908.803,Then out to the closure of the West Seattle bridge to Council members about three hours before actually closing the bridge.,266,,

784,0.97,5596.023,5623.985,This is in line with much of the conversation we have already had today so I will just say that while there has been action taken at the city in the state to protect--from Eviction all of our offices are carrying the concerns that we already talked about today that banks will Foreclose on thousands of property owners and that those property owners are facing a loss of income for households and small businesses due to the downward spiral in the market.,342,,
