77,0.97,324.557,327.06,Thank you.,56,,
78,0.97,327.126,331.964,"I move to hold item 17 resolution 31998 until June 7th, 2021.",56,,
79,0.97,332.031,348.848,Item 17 on the agenda was a resolution from my office urging the Mayor and the governor to extend the moratoriums to Evictions to the end of 2021.,56,,
80,0.97,348.915,358.558,Mayor Durkan agreed to three months to the end of June . This is not everything that the Renters movement is fighting for but a clear victory for those that have been fighting for it.,56,,
81,0.97,358.624,371.237,Obviously we would have preferred more than 43 minutes notice before this resolution came up for a vote that Mayor was responding to our commands and the timing is improbable coincidence.,56,,
82,0.97,371.304,392.725,"Giving this breaking news I am open to holding the vote which is why I am proposing that it be held for three months until June 7th hopefully before then the Mayor and the governor will agree to extend the moratorium until the end of this year as this resolution request and if they do not, we will have the resolution ready for a vote at that time.",56,,
83,0.97,392.792,403.803,I think it is important that obvious grow Renter right movement as a sign of growing power.,56,,
84,0.97,403.87,416.883,They did not extent it for the full year but conceding to a three month extension and protection she did something that big business and the landlord lobby.,56,,
85,0.97,416.949,419.185,Carpet landlord lobby has fought against.,56,,
86,0.97,419.252,438.704,"It is the 3683 community members that hold victory, ordinary people that signed our petitions calling for a moratorium extension that are 210 community members that wrote personal moving stories to the city council about how they were struggling and why the moratorium must be extended.",56,,
87,0.97,438.771,444.243,The hundreds of people that have written other letters and spoke up demanding an extension.,56,,
88,0.97,444.31,484.417,The 17 community activists that signed along with me are important that appeared on the January 22nd stranger including Gabe Truebin executive director of Seattle and the Washington State and Luka Cachecka of 1488 and Carol Riley president of the Wacp and Sierra Parsons at war block and Dr. Brandon Pableesky president of the resident and fellow Union . Northwest and the U-Dub and hospitals Bernard struck from the same Union as executive director.,56,,
89,0.97,484.483,526.158,"Carla es TA vast that the owner of a small business in district two and Shirley Henderson Co- owner of a shop in the central district and District three . matt Bremley who is a Renter's rights activist and black rights activist of the Chateau garden and Samantha Thompson, Sierra Loreinno and that Vino Moreno art and garden and Oliver Mitch Socialist of America and Renter right activist in district two and Kate Wilson from the agenda writers Union.",56,,
90,0.97,526.225,562.762,This victory belongs to those people I mentioned and also to the relationships and the 47 organizations that wrote a joint letter to Mayor Durkan calling for a full year extension of the moratorium that is something we will continue to push forward but for now this is extremely relief for Renters to have three months extension and I wanted to include some of those 47 organizations including the 43rd district and the Ballard community task force on homelessness and hunger and body heart and mind Academy . creative justice.,56,,
91,0.97,562.828,580.012,L center and faith active network and one America and Mlk labor counsel and nickels vote and protest 17 and greenhouse help line and real change . Seattle entrance help vote and Seattle Council on coalition a homelessness.,56,,

94,0.97,585.584,585.851,Sierra Club.,56,,
95,0.97,585.918,590.056,The Urbanist and 21 and local aid.,56,,
96,0.97,590.122,642.174,There is many other organizations that have done this and I won't be able to mention all of them but the grassroots organizations stuck together and made a bold demand and we are a portion victory and important to claim that as a victory for the moment to use that as energy to keep ensure that in the rest of this year also we convey the message to Renters and we are not done and will keep fighting for the full year extension because that is what working people need and that is what the statistics show that pandemic is not going to end anytime soon as far as economic impact and that those protections will continue to be needed in addition to can canceling rents and utility payments for affected homeowners and Renters and small businesses and small landlords.,56,,
97,0.97,642.241,642.475,Thank you.,56,,
98,0.97,642.541,645.011,Thank you Sawant.,57,,

105,0.97,725.991,744.276,I thank the for Seconding this motion and I have made I think a really compelling argument for why we should take the three month extension and continue to monitor the situation and make sure to come back to this when the resolution will be needed . I will just stop there.,60,,

142,0.97,858.857,859.692,Okay.,81,,
143,0.97,859.758,875.874,It has been moved and Seconded to hold agenda item 16 Council bill 12007 until March 29th . couple member Pederson you are remembering Niced in order to address the motion to hold item number 16.,81,,
144,0.97,875.941,880.512,"Thank you, Council President.",82,,
145,0.97,880.579,881.08,Colleagues.,82,,
146,0.97,881.146,883.148,Item 16 on the agenda Council bill 1007.,82,,
147,0.97,883.215,893.125,It is the proposal to provide attorneys at no cost regardless of a Tenant'S circumstances in an Eviction proceeding known as right to counsel.,82,,
148,0.97,893.192,905.537,The bill that comes after several positive actions as city Council has taken to assist residential tenants to achieve confinement.,82,,
149,0.97,905.604,909.408,I believe the city council simply needs more time.,82,,
150,0.97,909.475,931.43,Just moments ago our Mayor announced another extension of the moratorium on Evictions . It can provide the Council with time to refine the details of the new and permanent change being proposed by Council bill 120007.,82,,
151,0.97,931.497,932.965,Thank you for your consideration.,82,,
152,0.97,933.032,953.886,Thank you Pederson for those comments . are there any additional comments on the motion to hold item 16 until March 29th.,83,,
153,0.97,953.952,954.653,"Councilmember Sawant, please.",84,,
154,0.97,954.72,955.287,You're on moot.,85,,
155,0.97,955.354,967.366,This is the guaranteed right to counsel to all Renters who are facing Eviction.,86,,
156,0.97,967.433,984.249,"I'm unclear why Councilmember Pederson wants to delay it . He voted no and we know where he stands I am not clear in any honesty Councilmember Pederson proposes to learn more about the bill between now and the 29th, I believe that is what was suggested.",86,,
157,0.97,984.316,1023.021,The fact is that we have been discussing right to counsel all year that is over two months actually this point about having legal aid for Renters facing Eviction is a point discussed by the Council over three budget seasons because it was three years ago that the people's budget movement in my office were able to win the first ever city of Seattle funding for Eviction attorneys . Every budget season we extended that budget funding.,86,,
158,0.97,1023.088,1058.056,"We have evidence, physical evidence that is actually helping Renters and more than that, we have evidence from multiple cities about how not only have they already passed the right to counsel guaranteed rights and you have a trained attorney along your side when you face an Eviction and you go to court but these cities, many of these cities like New York City and San Francisco have by no means limited to those cities have rights to counsel several years ago well before the pandemic.",86,,
159,0.97,1058.123,1072.638,We have the advantage of seeing overwhelming and very strong statistical evidence if Councilmembers want to be data driven about how much it helps every Renter.,86,,
160,0.97,1072.704,1077.409,Having a lawyer to prevent an Eviction could mean life and death difference.,86,,
161,0.97,1077.476,1110.876,You have seen the numbers and the losing home report from the women's Commission and the King County bar Association that shows that nearly 90% of people that face and end up evicted also end up becoming homeless . So this is a devastating experience and sort of a lifeline to homelessness unless Evictions are prevented and I am not sure what two week delay is going to accomplish beyond what we have discussed.,86,,
162,0.97,1110.943,1168.967,"We have had extensive discussions in two committees and as I said all of this year and in the past three years we had presentation after presentation from the attorneys themselves, not just from tenant's rights activists in general but attorneys themselves that have shown us powerful evidence about how in cities that have right to counsel especially in cities that have strong right to counsel is actually had a positive impact not only on how it prevents Evictions but how Eviction filings have gone down because landlords now know that they face not just a tenant by themselves but a trained attorney that is going to know exactly what to do to prevent that Eviction and present the tenant to other sources of help like rental assistance.",86,,
163,0.97,1169.034,1182.481,Rental assistance does not work by itself but they are compliments to each other and preventing the Eviction in court legally.,86,,
164,0.97,1182.548,1185.884,Is a necessary component of protecting Renters.,86,,
165,0.97,1185.951,1199.898,We know it is women and specifically black women that are deeply affected by Evictions and we have seen from New York that 86% of tenants represented by counsel remain in their homes.,86,,
166,0.97,1199.965,1221.92,"This is just staggering evidence of what good we can do Biling amounts of funding . I can promise you regardless of which sort of spectrum of estimates you look at, the Eviction defense from the city will cost less than one percent of the Seattle police Department's budget.",86,,
167,0.97,1221.987,1228.527,So it shows that it Safes life literally Safes lives and not a hyperbole and we have discussed this a lot.,86,,
168,0.97,1228.594,1242.674,Seen a lot of overwhelming data driven evidence and not sure what can be gleaned if we wait actually it affects Renters more because they wouldn't have this protection.,86,,
169,0.97,1242.741,1258.79,"It will be delayed having that protection and I would also add my staff have done extensive outreach to Councilmembers especially who are in the committee, Councilmember Pederson in the committee asking them about questions that we can answer from my office.",86,,
170,0.97,1258.857,1288.286,Asking them to submit questions to central staff and from the central staff have done an excellent job taking every question that came her way by providing numbers based data . In closing I'm not sure what would be gained by delayed other than an attempt to derail the movement that is clearly ready to fight and win today this right to counsel without loopholes.,86,,
171,0.97,1288.353,1289.087,Councilmember please.,87,,
172,0.97,1289.154,1289.388,Thanks.,88,,
173,0.97,1289.454,1294.226,I want to say that I am excited about voting in favor of this legislation.,88,,
174,0.97,1294.292,1299.331,I think that this is really important bill.,88,,
175,0.97,1299.398,1303.935,And I am supporting the request for a delay.,88,,
176,0.97,1304.002,1329.761,Based on you know what for me in my time on the Council is a standard practice of when your colleague asks for a delay . It is not a declaration of war against the policy but it is really about working to try--I'm hoping in good faith to make a better bill.,88,,
177,0.97,1329.828,1349.281,"I have been Privy to some of the even though I'm not a committee member, I have been Privy to some of the questions being asked about the bill and received summary of questions and answers from central staff . and I believe that we can make this a better stronger more defensible bill in the next two week.",88,,
178,0.97,1349.347,1354.519,I did have a couple of amendments that I was proposing today.,88,,
179,0.97,1354.586,1370.969,To try to take a step towards doing so but I agree that the additional two weeks will help us all have an opportunity to strengthen the bill.,88,,
180,0.97,1371.036,1374.106,Thank you.,88,,
181,0.97,1374.172,1375.841,Councilmember,89,,
182,0.97,1375.907,1403.835,I am too excited right to Council is fundamental in a lot of things we do in sorts and historically in the United States and lawyers are well aware we are not extended a right to counsel including Eviction proceedings and that has had inequitable and unfair consequences.,90,,
183,0.97,1403.902,1417.549,I am appreciative to Councilmember Sawant's efforts on the information she has made available through central staff and through her staff throughout the Pendency of this process especially for people that are on the committee like myself.,90,,
184,0.97,1417.616,1426.892,And you know with this motion coming forward I can't say that I disagree it may make a difference to wait until the 29th.,90,,
185,0.97,1426.958,1433.899,Because of some of the Follow- up information I've received from the law Department in drilling down into some of their concerns.,90,,
186,0.97,1433.965,1470.735,I think it is important to note that part of the reason this Council has been so profoundly successful in producing pro tenant legislation that survives rigorous and well funded legal challenges there is a reason we don't have to do a landlord right to counsel . They are going to sue and come after this the way they have come after everything else and the law Department has been able to turn them back and win and defend those rights in court because we have worked carefully to construct legislation that will survive those attacks.,90,,
187,0.97,1470.802,1525.056,"There are a couple of salient issues that I still think need to be tightened up in places to make sure that this will survive those challenges . and you know I would be interested in having a full on executive session for the benefit of the entire counsel on the legislation during the time that we have between now and when Councilmember Pederson is requesting we take this up again to see if we can figure out ways to, you know, even if it doesn't lead to material changes in the bill strengthen up through recitals or statements or comments on legislative intent or whatever else to show how we are structuring this to fit within the constraints of some legal issues we need to be mindful of.",90,,
188,0.97,1525.123,1531.296,"So for that reason, I don't see any disadvantage to waiting until the 29th.",90,,
189,0.97,1531.363,1536.101,And we will be supporting this motion.,90,,
190,0.97,1536.167,1540.372,Thank you Lewis.,91,,
191,0.97,1540.438,1542.44,Councilmember Sawant I see your hand up.,91,,
192,0.97,1542.507,1565.964,Since you are the prime sponsor of the actual bill I thought perhaps it would be better to allow other Councilmembers to make comments to allow to you respond to all of them as opposed because under the rules each Councilmember only has two bites at the apple I want to make sure that you are take that second bite when it make most sense.,91,,
193,0.97,1566.031,1566.765,Would that be okay?,91,,
194,0.97,1566.831,1573.138,I am happy to wait other Councilmembers have spoken.,92,,
195,0.97,1573.204,1573.538,Great.,93,,
196,0.97,1573.605,1580.011,Any other colleagues any other Councilmembers that would like to make a comment?,93,,
197,0.97,1580.078,1580.612,Yes.,94,,
198,0.97,1580.679,1581.146,Councilmember Juarez.,95,,
199,0.97,1581.212,1581.513,I'm sorry.,96,,
200,0.97,1581.579,1593.425,I am away from the site to I am trying to do it from the phone . I would like to support a request for delay and I want to really thank Councilmember Herbold for her words.,96,,
201,0.97,1593.491,1595.26,This has struck me as important bill.,96,,
202,0.97,1595.327,1599.03,I do want to make it a better bill and I do want to make it a better law.,96,,
203,0.97,1599.097,1601.8,We have talked about as you know there are lawyers on this Council.,96,,
204,0.97,1601.866,1610.909,We all know that we have a 6th amend right to counsel based on the United States Constitution and criminality.,96,,
205,0.97,1610.976,1620.685,And we should point out there is six other areas in which we provide free legal representation based on eligibility.,96,,
206,0.97,1620.752,1623.221,Not a means testing.,96,,
207,0.97,1623.288,1623.555,Eligibility.,96,,
208,0.97,1623.621,1630.095,Through the office of public defense.,96,,
209,0.97,1630.161,1637.936,That is dependency action and mental health and civil proceedings and people that face contempt for child support and civil commitment.,96,,
210,0.97,1638.003,1654.419,A whole array of where the government steps in and pays for legal counsel outside of the sixth amendment right to counsel when you are charged and you are deemed eligible to have legal counsel.,96,,
211,0.97,1654.486,1654.753,Or indigent.,96,,
212,0.97,1654.819,1655.053,I'm sorry.,96,,
213,0.97,1655.12,1665.563,I had an opportunity to pull up and look at the Department of policies and procedures under Opd and I believe I talked to Councilmember Lewis about this off line.,96,,
214,0.97,1665.63,1671.936,I think that all of the energy and the Intentionity of this is right on.,96,,
215,0.97,1672.003,1674.239,I think this is something that we should be doing.,96,,
216,0.97,1674.305,1685.55,I'm concerned about the cost and I'm concerned about eligibility.,96,,
217,0.97,1685.617,1717.816,"I believe there should be determining eligibility like in other areas and probably if we sit down and look at how we would restructure the eligibility requirements . I think we could have a lower standard for people to have free legal counsel in the event that they are being evicted unfairly and it can look something like Opd, office of opposed defense does and I thing I did share this with Councilmember Lewis.",96,,
218,0.97,1717.882,1724.189,"It is not that I'm against the movement, I'm not against homeless people.",96,,
219,0.97,1724.255,1726.558,I'm not against all of the thing that come up.,96,,
220,0.97,1726.624,1734.265,What I really want is a piece of legislation that I can vote yes on that can guarantee legal counsel to people that are eligible.,96,,
221,0.97,1734.332,1736.301,Those are obviously going to be low-income people.,96,,
222,0.97,1736.367,1743.274,They are not going to be the same people that we would look at for eligibility requirements for criminals.,96,,
223,0.97,1743.341,1744.442,And I think that the standard should be higher.,96,,
224,0.97,1744.509,1765.897,I think if we were to try to pass it today under its logical conclusion and common sense and not trying to start a movement does this mean if I make one hundred thousand dollars a year and I quit paying my rent that I get a free lawyer and the city picks up the tab?,96,,
225,0.97,1765.964,1768.933,I don't think that is right . I want to make it right.,96,,
226,0.97,1769.0,1800.198,I want to make it better . I want it to be able to withstand legal scrutiny and I think what Councilmember Lewis said and I appreciate that we have seen the memos and thank you for the great memos that came out of the law Department . I think if we had executive session we can carve out some and have the eligibility requirement and make it so that we protect the people under the difficult circumstances that they have legal counsel during Eviction hearings and that is something I want to do.,96,,
227,0.97,1800.265,1808.873,I am going to be supporting a request for the delay.,96,,
228,0.97,1808.94,1811.042,Thank you.,96,,
229,0.97,1811.109,1811.91,Thank you Juarez.,97,,
230,0.97,1811.976,1821.219,I can't tell if another hand is up or new?,97,,
231,0.97,1821.286,1821.519,Hold on.,97,,
232,0.97,1821.586,1822.654,"Councilmember Morales, you are next in the Queue.",97,,
233,0.97,1822.72,1851.683,I am proud to be Cosponsoring this legislation . I do think it's important that we bring all tenants representation in Eviction cases and I think it is also important to know that this support shouldn't be contingent on public health emergency and numbers of properties owned by landlords or any other kinds of means testing is poor people that get evicted and that's clear.,98,,
234,0.97,1851.749,1871.97,"Prior to the pandemic tenants already face tough odds in Eviction courts if they didn't have legal representation and Eviction more are moratorium are lifted in the country and here in Washington and emergency in the Rear-View mirror, we know that many of our neighbors will be in tougher situations.",98,,
235,0.97,1872.036,1876.908,Straight forward legislation . I don't think there is a lot we can do to strengthen it.,98,,
236,0.97,1876.975,1890.888,I think any delay would really only be you know risk diminishing the impact that this could have and so I will not be supporting motion to delay.,98,,
237,0.97,1890.955,1892.69,Thank you Morales.,99,,
238,0.97,1892.757,1902.267,"Any other Councilmembers that would like to make a comment? Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",99,,
239,0.97,1902.333,1907.038,Thank you Madam Unfortunately whatever legal memos that folks are referring to.,100,,
240,0.97,1907.105,1916.447,My office has not seen those . If there are questions and concerns that have coming up since this has been in the hopper for the last week I would have appreciated having those sent my way.,100,,
241,0.97,1916.514,1938.202,"I, too, underscore the importance of making sure that folks have access to legal protection but I think this Council has done a tremendous job in listening to not just Renters but small landlords as we are making sure that people have protections and making sure the smallest landlords have access to dollars via Restal assistance and other support.",100,,
242,0.97,1938.269,1963.361,Moving forward on this today but also want to make sure that we are on solid legal ground . I have had conversations with folk in the office of housing and asked about concerns based on the review of the committee meeting I saw last week where questions were asked about public housing and the book on public housing and assured there was no concern.,100,,
243,0.97,1963.428,1985.616,So I do not think that there are significant concerns to delay today and in fact I think that if there are ongoing conversations I will be happy to support the bill when it does move forward but I do hope it does move forward today and will be supporting an effort to vote today.,100,,
244,0.97,1985.683,1990.154,Any other comments amendment to hold?,101,,
245,0.97,1990.221,2000.131,And I still know you are in the Queue Councilmember Sawant . Okay.,101,,
246,0.97,2000.198,2003.434,I'll just quickly Chime in here.,101,,
247,0.97,2003.501,2013.211,I am going to support a motion to hold the bill based on the debate unfolding today.,101,,
248,0.97,2013.277,2022.754,I do like Councilmember her her and many others support the underlying goal and purpose of the legislation.,101,,
249,0.97,2022.82,2029.761,My support to hold is a procedural vote and not one about the substance of the underlying policy.,101,,
250,0.97,2029.827,2074.338,"I have in fact in the past supported and in some instances agreed to, if memory serves me cosponsor Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Herbold's efforts to increase funding for legal aid and legal defense in the space of tenant protections and continue to believe that having a systemic fix to the issues facing tenants that are a significant disadvantage in legal proceeding is the right policy for the city to pursue . Second, a long time supporter of legal aid for those that need it most.",101,,
251,0.97,2074.405,2096.794,For those on the Council in 2016 you recall I was a sponsor for the legal defense fund to provide free attorneys to those facing deportation proceedings based on clear eligibility criteria.,101,,
252,0.97,2096.861,2132.196,I so I am a long time supporter making sure that we have supports and legal counsel in these really difficult legal proceedings where there is clear Positional power and excited for opportunity for the city of Seattle to finally pursue a right to counsel opportunity and I'm appreciative for the efforts that are allowing us to do so . So I am going to support this motion to hold simply on the procedural aspects.,101,,
253,0.97,2132.263,2139.136,I will commit to holding an executive session on Monday March 22nd.,101,,
254,0.97,2139.203,2154.151,"And that will, I think, allow us plenty of opportunity to resolve some of the issues that have been flagged in this conversation today by Monday, March 29th.",101,,
255,0.97,2154.218,2199.497,I do want to say that I have had an opportunity to look at legal memorandums that raise significant concerns about the bill and the form that it currently exists in and I do think there is an opportunity to address those concerns while still fulfilling the underlying intent of this bill which is to provide those that need it the most free legal counsel in these Eviction proceedings . The bill and the individuals seeking this would be best served by an additional two weeks to,101,,
256,0.97,2386.117,2410.007,But as far as other than Pederson voted no . If you delay it as a procedural vote let's take your word for a second.,102,,
257,0.97,2410.074,2419.617,I don't agree with postponing this for delaying Eviction . they don't get a delay and have Councilmembers saying Hey landlord please delay the Eviction.,102,,
258,0.97,2419.683,2442.973,The truth is they get evicted . I don't agree with the postponing and the supposed sort of delay just to be careful and to have legislation or a procedure vote in my view is a signal to tenants that the establishment cares about landlords than tenants getting evicted every day.,102,,
259,0.97,2443.04,2447.678,Right now Renters are being evicted.,102,,
260,0.97,2447.745,2456.821,It is not hyperbole to delay the protections and it is actually a bad thing even by a few things because Renters are being evicted at the rate of one Adair.,102,,
261,0.97,2456.887,2489.72,"There is one family being devastated every day in order to satisfy a system that supports carpet landlord . It is genuinely a desire to have clarification, fine . Then let's vote on this and make sure that in two weeks and make sure it is a strong bill and to say make it strongly I don't understand.",102,,
262,0.97,2489.787,2490.988,This is a strong bill.,102,,
263,0.97,2491.055,2511.876,How will you make it stronger? you can act on Resitals as Councilmember Lewis was saying . What would the law actually do? its already very strong.,102,,
264,0.97,2511.942,2524.221,My suspicion is you want to make it weaker and somehow we consulted with the attorney's office.,102,,
265,0.97,2524.288,2540.905,We have done a thorough assessment with the attorney's Úoffice and they have gift of public funds and I don't blame the members of the public if you don't understand because it is technical language but I wanted to use that because that is one of the things that Councilmembers are referring to without referring to it.,102,,
266,0.97,2540.971,2560.858,"I wanted to quoted Whitner from the housing project that found it ridiculous and to quote him from an article published this morning in the stranger and said ""in the city funds a food Bank and doesn't ask how much the shoppers make is that a violation of the gift of public funds?",102,,
267,0.97,2560.925,2561.025,".""",102,,
268,0.97,2561.091,2577.841,Councilmembers do and this is to people in the movement is insert eligibility requirements because they will claim that somehow the city attorney's office are legally they are not able to do it . that is not true.,103,,
269,0.97,2577.908,2587.017,An administrator that is an attorney with long experience of defending tenants have found the idea ridiculous because why should that happen?,103,,
270,0.97,2587.084,2598.128,And more and more Renter's rights have won and stood the test of the court because people are fighting back and most of those laws have been from our movement and from my office.,103,,
271,0.97,2598.195,2606.236,The reason that the Council is profoundly successful in passing Renter'S rights because socialists are getting organized.,103,,
272,0.97,2606.303,2638.469,"Last but not least I want to warn members of the public and union members and Nonunion workers and socialists that are fighting for Renters rights and for the right of Council bills without loop holes I warn you, we can't stop building this movement because we have to prevent this delay from being used as a means to push in means testing loop holes . In other cities similar things happen when the bills got weakened with loop holes it is when Democratic politicians brought that forward.",103,,
273,0.97,2638.535,2646.377,If today progressive Democrats on the city council are saying they don't intend to put in bad loop holes but they want clarification fine.,103,,
274,0.97,2646.443,2655.486,Let's hold them to it and important that movement activists understand from what is happening today that we need to fight harder.,103,,
275,0.97,2655.552,2666.964,We cannot trust the regular politicians and have to fight for what we need.,103,,
276,0.97,2667.031,2667.264,Thank you.,103,,
277,0.97,2667.331,2667.831,Councilmember,104,,
278,0.97,2667.898,2669.9,Thank you.,105,,
279,0.97,2669.967,2670.167,Apology.,105,,
280,0.97,2670.234,2679.943,I could not figure out how to raise my virtual hand so I just raised my hand.,105,,
281,0.97,2680.01,2701.532,"I, too are interested in executive sessions to make sure we have as sound a bill to Councilmember Sawant's point I don't think everybody is afraid of Corporated landlords what we are afraid of or assisting them what we are afraid of is creating a bill that is not legally sound.",105,,
282,0.97,2701.598,2721.485,This is such important work that we have to do it right and I'm excited to have those meeting and come up to speed that I myself have not read the legal memorandums and its important to understand what we are he voting on.,105,,
283,0.97,2721.552,2728.559,Just to note we have disagreements all the time but don't need to call in such vicious members.,105,,
284,0.97,2728.625,2740.804,I have not said anything to the folks that have voted against my bills and still support them and talk to them regularly . that's an aside.,105,,
285,0.97,2740.871,2743.207,Thank you Council President.,105,,
286,0.97,2743.273,2750.581,Thank you so much Councilmember Strauss.,106,,
287,0.97,2750.647,2750.981,Appreciate that.,106,,
288,0.97,2751.048,2816.813,"I do want to note that the--it's important for us not to be dismissed of the realities around the prohibition on the gift of public funds and I know that is a hyper technical term and I want to acknowledge that local government and elected officials we are constitutionally required from avoiding a situation in which we are doing effectively a gift of public funds and in short that means doing a gift or lending money, property or the credit to a private party that not ordinarily tied with exceptions in the Constitution . whether we agree with that constitutional provision or not it is in place and we are required as elected officials to comply with those constitutional requirements and there are at least two people in this full council meet that have you indicated that they have not had the full benefit of seeing or knowing that there are legal memorandum Donees related to this particular underlying bill.",106,,
289,0.97,2816.88,2822.352,I do think we would benefit from executive session to ensure that all of us are on the same page.,106,,
290,0.97,2822.419,2831.895,Not all of us on this Committee and not all of us given that Council rules are allowed to attend without invitation from the chair.,106,,
291,0.97,2831.962,2847.778,"I think that this is an important opportunity for us to all get on the same page . do so with the benefit of our attorneys, hear the same information and figure out how to move forward as appropriate in open session after our executive session.",106,,
292,0.97,2847.844,2850.814,Look forward to the opportunity to do that.,106,,
293,0.97,2850.881,2860.424,Councilmember Pederson you have the last word and we will close that debate after this and get to other items of business on our agenda.,106,,
294,0.97,2860.49,2866.597,Thank you I appreciate the discussion that we had to go through these items.,107,,
295,0.97,2866.663,2878.442,I just conclude by saying that this city Council has enacted numerous budgetary and regular policies to benefit tenants and will continue to do so.,107,,
296,0.97,2878.508,2903.533,In light of an extension moratorium that occurred an hour ago for another three months I think another two weeks to make this bill more sustainable is a prudent and will benefit the legislation despite my concerns with it I think that's--I appreciate the comments of everyone here taking seriously the concerns that have been raised.,107,,
297,0.97,2903.6,2905.002,Thank you.,107,,
298,0.97,2905.068,2907.204,"Thank you, Pederson.",108,,
299,0.97,2907.271,2924.755,I will close that debate and ask that clerk call the roll on motion to hold agenda item 16 to March 20th.,108,,
300,0.97,2924.821,2925.355,Lewis.,109,,
301,0.97,2925.422,2926.323,Yes.,110,,

345,0.97,3027.691,3044.408,It remains the intent to have public on meeting Agendas but as a reminder the city council reserves the right to end these comments periods at any point if we deem that system is abused or no longer suitable for the meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively.,147,,

348,0.97,3053.784,3056.853,With each Speaker being given two minutes to speak.,147,,
349,0.97,3056.92,3061.324,We do have quite a volume of speakers signed up for public comment today.,147,,

365,0.97,3202.966,3263.293,My name is Dan in the CD and this morning I found out that my downstairs neighbor Dolly has been [Indiscernible] for months . Our landlord has refused to allow them to fill empty rooms in their unit turning down every applicant but expected to pay for the extra rooms and he has tried everything he can to harass them to leaving despite the Eviction moratorium and lied trying to say safety hazards and lied about the water bill and turned it off illegally but not happening to only Dolly but thousands of Renters and it has gotten to the point that she is exhausted and given up and moving out to live in a Van and be homeless and how dare the Councilmembers sitting on six figure salary with people facing daily Harassment from the landlord in jumping through bureaucratic hoops.,148,,
366,0.97,3263.36,3280.276,"I don't care if it hurts your feelings, no loop holes and no delay.",148,,

368,0.97,3280.91,3285.348,I am calling in the right to Council legislation.,150,,
369,0.97,3285.415,3308.204,I am disgusted that the city Council has postponed the vote . This delay is the same sort of dishonest attempt that we have seen time and time again . Councilmember Juarez said that she is not talking about adding testing but requiring tenants to prove their income level is means testing.,150,,
370,0.97,3308.271,3311.508,The assertion that people abuse the right to counsel is not reality.,150,,
371,0.97,3311.574,3318.148,It is a serious obstacle to people that are eligible for receiving aid.,150,,
372,0.97,3318.214,3334.264,We need the legislation as written with no loop holes . This delay to supposedly make the bill more defensible sounds like nothing more than an opportunity to drive through massive loop holes and what city council just did--we can't afford to wait.,150,,
373,0.97,3334.33,3345.809,We are in the middle of a global House crisis and it is critical we pass this now . other cities --,150,,

377,0.97,3356.119,3358.555,Hello I'm Kate hello.,152,,
378,0.97,3358.621,3369.132,My name is Kate Reuben a Renter in district 2 and the executive director and I am calling on Councilmember Sawant without means testing.,152,,
379,0.97,3369.199,3397.927,Being forced to prove economic hardship will make it harder Foretenants overwhelmed and struggling for overlapping crisis to access the service . Many tenants self Evict because they feel like it is the only option and they don't know rights and when they do there is a huge power in balance . They are caught with lawyers and struggling to put on the table.,152,,
380,0.97,3397.994,3413.376,Without representation how will they represent themselves . These communities with affected before the pandemic begin . giving them fair representation and support will help them stay housed and save lives.,152,,
381,0.97,3413.443,3414.744,Thank you.,152,,
382,0.97,3414.811,3418.348,Next is Grayson vans Artsdale and via Lacon.,153,,
383,0.97,3418.414,3423.753,"Hey, I'm Grayson and Renter in D3.",154,,
384,0.97,3423.82,3428.191,I politely the first time but I am angry.,154,,
385,0.97,3428.258,3456.519,With every place I lived that withheld information that misrepresented the lease . with every place that lived because I am Transgender and I am a working class person and never been behind on rent . The average American family was behind $6000 on rent and life has not gotten better and right now they are not guaranteed to stop being evicted.,154,,
386,0.97,3456.586,3461.958,Councilmembers this is not hyperbole.,154,,
387,0.97,3462.025,3483.446,In postponing this and trying to pave this over as legally necessary when it is not . Lastly Councilmember Juarez--you are a disappointment.,154,,
388,0.97,3483.513,3486.182,Next is Bea Gainser.,155,,
389,0.97,3486.249,3494.958,I a Renner in we need Councilmember Sawant right to legislation without loop holes.,156,,
390,0.97,3495.024,3497.861,I'm disgusted of the delay of the vote.,156,,
391,0.97,3497.927,3501.464,Renters are being evicted about one a day.,156,,
392,0.97,3501.531,3516.579,So each day that passes without the legislation is another day that Seattle residents and can even die.,156,,
393,0.97,3516.646,3548.144,I am disgusted at Councilmember Juarez's comments facing criminal Evictions to criminals and I would like those repulsive to a young black member that was threatened with Eviction by a landlord because they claimed she owed them two . hiding behind legal terms to poke holes in the legislation is shameful and not surprising from the corporate politicians with their six figure salaries . We have to fight harder if we are going to win.,156,,
394,0.97,3548.211,3549.145,Thank you.,157,,
395,0.97,3549.212,3566.496,"Just as a reminder to the public Commenters, please keep your comments focused on legislation as to Impugning motives and character of the Councilmembers.",157,,
396,0.97,3566.562,3573.77,Next up is Sarah Gownser . Sarah.,157,,
397,0.97,3573.836,3574.037,Welcome.,157,,
398,0.97,3574.103,3574.27,Hi.,158,,
399,0.97,3574.337,3582.578,My name is Sarah and a Renter and cap Hill and in support of the Eviction moratorium and the right to counsel.,158,,
400,0.97,3582.645,3585.281,As we know working people have suffered the brunt of the pandemic.,158,,
401,0.97,3585.348,3590.286,Millions are jobless and forced to go to further debt to pay basic bills.,158,,
402,0.97,3590.353,3599.395,As the Eviction moratorium is about to expire at the end of the month that today we found out that is expanded for three more months.,158,,
403,0.97,3599.462,3602.966,Obviously we should celebrate that but that's definitely not enough.,158,,
404,0.97,3603.032,3613.943,And thousands of Renters would be at risk of Eviction after those three months are up . We need to extend the Eviction moratorium through the end of the year without any corporate loop holes.,158,,
405,0.97,3614.01,3639.435,"On top of this, we need to support those that are currently facing Eviction by giving tenants a fighting chance in court through a right to counsel and someone facing Eviction can rarely show the cost to providing --",158,,
406,0.97,3639.502,3666.963,Next is real followed by Margo Stewart . I am a real change vendor . landlord management companies have all of the advantages in this process.,159,,
407,0.97,3667.03,3680.276,I believe in these hard times Seattle should not do this because Seattle has a homeless population and many not because of their fault.,159,,
408,0.97,3680.343,3691.421,So in Seattle'S best interests I believe that legal counsel can go a long ways in relieving this downward spiral.,159,,
409,0.97,3691.487,3701.731,As we speak our leaders are promoting this just passed stimulus package.,159,,
410,0.97,3701.798,3713.576,We know who these people that are facing Eviction who they are and what they need.,159,,
411,0.97,3713.643,3717.48,Let's not add to homelessness.,159,,
412,0.97,3717.547,3718.314,Next is Margo,160,,
413,0.97,3718.381,3741.771,My name is Renter in district three and glad to hear about the expense and Eviction moratorium that Renters want but disappointed to delay the vote on Councilmember Sawant's bill for legal right to counsel.,161,,
414,0.97,3741.838,3792.989,Councilmembers have talked about making this better but I have not heard about suggestions how to be better so I think it is loop holes and means testing and limitation for the acceptability of low income tenants and people of color although on the other hand I do know for a fact that there are people living near me that have been harassed and felt Evicting themselves because they don't know what legal Recourses are available and if they had these measures already they would have been able to keep housing so I am currently splitting costs with a roommate facing medical bills for a chronic condition that complicates her ability to find work.,161,,
415,0.97,3793.055,3799.929,These people Eviction.,161,,
416,0.97,3799.996,3800.93,Next up is Matthew,162,,
417,0.97,3800.997,3815.378,My name is matt I'm a Renter in district 2. I think it is a huge victory for the moment it is extended . We need to extend it to the end of 2021.,163,,
418,0.97,3815.444,3820.082,We have been this since 2016 and it has been going on longer.,163,,
419,0.97,3820.149,3857.119,Renters are facing a waiver of Eviction after the moratorium end and they need the security of knowing that at least they will have recourse to a right to counsel if landlords try to Evict them and every single delay means that Renters are left in Limbos and give landlords an opportunity to mobilize against the critical protection and Councilmember Gonzalez I think it is outrageous that you intimidate against ordinary people that are delaying a vote at the last minute that dozens of people came to speak in favor of and critical project for Renters that have been facing unjust Evictions for year.,163,,
420,0.97,3857.186,3866.262,We need to change the balance of power between Renters and big landlords.,163,,
421,0.97,3866.329,3866.996,Sussex management and other --,163,,
422,0.97,3867.063,3870.7,"Again, folks to intimidate anybody.",164,,
423,0.97,3870.766,3887.216,My job is to make sure we are enforcing the Council rules and that means we need to keep focused on the introduction referral Council.,164,,
424,0.97,3887.283,3892.355,If you could be mindful of that I would appreciate it.,164,,
425,0.97,3892.421,3898.828,Tara Mel Ler is next up.,164,,

429,0.97,3912.808,3924.186,As a Renter my complex was bought out by a new corporation during Covid-19 and looking at $300 increase in Ren when my lease comes up even though I am paying 50% of my income on remember.,165,,
430,0.97,3924.253,3954.583,There is no safety security if we fall behind on payments and need as much protection when facing the money hungry giants . The people getting evicted face poverty and disproportionate from poverty communities . This is a barrier to keep people from getting justice . Renters with no questions asked when faced with Evictions . please vote yes on this bill.,165,,

433,0.97,3966.495,3970.933,You know in your hearts that right to counsel is the right thing.,167,,
434,0.97,3971.0,3978.808,Delaying this bill to do means testing or eligibility Metrics just says you want to make it harder.,167,,
435,0.97,3978.874,3985.815,It is awful and Disheartening to hear about bad actors that make 100K a year.,167,,
436,0.97,3985.881,4006.902,Have we heard about this being real or political conjecture . 90% of landlords are represented by attorneys and such as my previous employer they don't have an attorney . I can tell you my small landlord has an attorney and he often starts with I spoke to my attorney.,167,,
437,0.97,4006.969,4011.207,I don't understand landlords that are against right to counsel.,167,,
438,0.97,4011.273,4024.72,"The landlords are not paying for the right to attorney and will still win, if they don't have length cases why are they against it?",167,,

445,0.97,4046.008,4057.186,An Eviction record reduces the opportunity for employment . At real change this is not an issue but so many of my real change community has trouble finding other income sources after being evicted.,169,,
446,0.97,4057.253,4065.027,I have been Unhoused and times that I was not capable of paying my rent on time.,169,,
447,0.97,4065.094,4072.902,To receive services you had to have Eviction on your record with no guarantee that they would get the money.,169,,
448,0.97,4072.968,4082.211,I was fortunate to have legal counsel within my family that were able to guide me in the correct direction.,169,,
449,0.97,4082.278,4091.654,Evictions are one of the first steps to people being Unhoused and Eviction moratorium are a great starting point to make real change.,169,,

494,0.97,4319.915,4323.786,Maybe that is too simple of an understanding.,188,,

521,0.97,4514.71,4525.32,Evictions don't only put people on the street but destroy their records and to find housing in the future and someone said if you are caught up in court they are in purgatory and can't get the aid they need.,197,,
522,0.97,4525.387,4549.811,I know some housing members are concerned about costs and protecting Renters could save the city millions and that sake them $35.6 million by investing now instead of later and to save on transportation costs and trying to house folks . I have heard about a Lim on who is eligible for the legal representation.,197,,
523,0.97,4549.878,4554.95,Means testing and we hear about it all the time and it hurts the position in need.,197,,

530,0.97,4848.476,4849.277,They got $200 million investment.,198,,
531,0.97,4849.344,4850.545,No means testing there.,198,,
532,0.97,4850.612,4882.21,It is important to understand the right to counsel does not force small landlords to Evict tenants but it means the convicted tenant gets a landlord that the small landlord does not pay for . Councilmember Gonzales you should not threaten Councilmember Sawant.,198,,
533,0.97,4882.277,4886.147,I support the right legislation with no means testing.,199,,

543,0.97,4961.356,4963.058,Emily I need you to your comments.,201,,
544,0.97,4963.124,4993.288,Without doing it is fair that the successful has a foot dragging approach . I know that Seattle process . broad band says municipal broad band would lift up communities of color and homeless people but here we are one year in the pandemic where children and workers are completely dependent on corporate owned Wi- Fi that is prone to outages and we don't have municipal broad band.,202,,
545,0.97,4993.355,5014.309,The reason that Council has passed this because having a Councilmember Sawant in office to fight for this legislation . Thank you for fighting for constituents that are paid by our tax dollars.,202,,

549,0.97,5032.861,5038.333,The idea of means testing or eligibility requirements that is the same thing is absolutely ridiculous.,204,,
550,0.97,5038.4,5045.84,People that are facing Eviction are a means tested group . If you have money you are not going to find yourself facing Eviction.,204,,
551,0.97,5045.907,5052.046,"The argument that people making $100,000 a year would abuse the system is absurd.",204,,
552,0.97,5052.113,5060.455,Means testing would serve black Renters and women Renters and parent and children.,204,,
553,0.97,5060.522,5076.004,I find it hypothetical that counsel is concerned about the cost but have no problem in approving 300 Million-Dollars budget and we need counsel with no loop holes.,204,,

799,0.97,6754.18,6758.618,Too many businesses have been forced to shut their doors for good.,345,,
800,0.97,6758.685,6769.963,And this past year has also showed us how creative and nimble business owners can be when they're faced with challenges.,345,,
801,0.97,6770.029,6797.157,We know that the code was not written for life during a pandemic and has not kept up . We all introduce brings people home to bring small business owners.,345,,
802,0.97,6797.223,6819.779,"And time limited year, by easing some of the owners . home based businesses are still regulated by other.",345,,
803,0.97,6819.846,6833.56,"City Seattle, Department of Afs in business and food and health care.",345,,
804,0.97,6833.626,6835.962,This does not change any of those regulatory.,345,,
805,0.97,6836.029,6849.108,They must be operated by a resident of the home that the business will be clearly accessory so secondary to the main use of the home as resident.,345,,
806,0.97,6849.175,6858.618,That the commercial deliveries are limited to one a day . I can tell you some of my neighbors get more in Amazon than that.,345,,
807,0.97,6858.685,6874.634,"But again, that's an aside . Lastly it's also very important to understand that home occupancy businesses still must abide by the noise, odor, light or smoke impacts that are currently written in the code . that they cannot be noticeable beyond the property.",345,,
808,0.97,6874.701,6883.61,By now also you've heard the story of Greenwood which were forced t close after they were found in violation of current code.,345,,
809,0.97,6883.676,6901.561,When yonder brought their situation to my attention with colleagues as well I'm sure . well to open our eyes that we have home occupancy businesses operating in our community that are not operating to the letter of the code and could be shut down if they were cited.,345,,
810,0.97,6901.628,6908.534,"Again once a citation is in the Cue, it cannot be undone even by the person that submit had the citation.",345,,
811,0.97,6908.601,6921.648,And that again is why we need to create this level playing field and why we need to provide this time limited flexible as an exception to the norm.,345,,
812,0.97,6921.714,6930.089,This bill is more than just about yonder it's about the opportunity to start and build a business.,345,,
813,0.97,6930.156,6938.931,By giving a struggling young business a time to move home for the moment to weather the storm and then come back in full bloom in our business districts.,345,,
814,0.97,6938.998,6943.236,Some of the most successful businesses in the world were founded in garages.,345,,
815,0.97,6943.303,6946.339,I heard about one at committee last week that sounds very delicious.,345,,
816,0.97,6946.406,6954.747,Now it is time for the city to make life easier for these entrepreneurs rather than shutting down the small businesses that make up the fabric of our community.,345,,
817,0.97,6954.814,6971.064,"We must make our neighborhoods, our land use code should not be a barrier to making our neighborhoods more vibrant and having a strong economy.",345,,

824,0.97,6996.289,7008.434,I have some remarks and I'm sure that Council member Mosqueda has some remarks also . My suggestion is we address the amendment first.,346,,
825,0.97,7008.501,7024.784,And then we can open it up to comments on the bill as amended from those who would like to speak on the bills amendment . If that sounds agreeable to folks I propose that's how we should move forward.,346,,
826,0.97,7024.851,7038.197,"Okay I'm not hearing any objection to that Let's go ahead and send it to Council member Herbold to allow her to move her, yes I can hear you now.",346,,
827,0.97,7038.264,7045.405,It's Council I'm in a different location on a different phone trying to do three different things.,347,,
828,0.97,7045.471,7056.349,I just wanted you to know that on the last items that we voted on regarding the Pike place market preservation that I voted yes but I didn't do the Star six.,347,,

834,0.97,7077.17,7081.274,"No, no need to go I just want you to know I'm here.",349,,

851,0.97,7192.985,7205.331,Just to know I did contact with staff having that conversation at briefing was very helpful . This is a very narrow amendment much like the bill being a very narrow bill.,356,,
852,0.97,7205.398,7217.543,I also had a time and opportunity to get a closer look at this amendment and had a conversation with my staff as well.,357,,
853,0.97,7217.61,7226.519,See it is very technical and Tphar narrow to this type of business.,357,,

875,0.97,7297.657,7303.396,The benefits and concerns the bill have been recorded in the media as well so I don't want to go through them here.,373,,
876,0.97,7303.462,7313.706,"But I do want to thank the committee chair and original Council, council member Strauss for taking time to raise and discuss the concerns in his committee.",373,,
877,0.97,7313.773,7317.41,I think that was very helpful for everybody.,373,,
878,0.97,7317.476,7318.31,Thank you.,373,,
879,0.97,7318.377,7319.945,Thank you.,374,,

881,0.97,7323.449,7328.054,"Thank you, Council President.",375,,
882,0.97,7328.12,7333.426,"I really appreciate the Council, the councils consideration of this bill today as amended.",375,,
883,0.97,7333.492,7339.865,Happy to be a cosponsor thank you very much Council member Strauss and Council President . I know you've been working on this for a while.,375,,
884,0.97,7339.932,7344.336,I'm very excited to be part of the team as we get this over the finish line.,375,,
885,0.97,7344.403,7348.174,To me this is really about what's good for economic resiliency of Seattle.,375,,
886,0.97,7348.24,7367.593,"And as you think about how many people have lost their job, their employment prior to the pandemic and folks who are being innovative and creative . I spoke about how some of our small businesses are fairing during this time.",375,,
887,0.97,7367.66,7377.169,Many entrepreneurs are doing everything they can to try to be innovative and change their business strategies so that they can survive.,375,,
888,0.97,7377.236,7390.816,And allowing for this type of code is really critical right now as people think about opening a business for the first time or modifying type of businesses that they had originally engaged in and doing it in a way that actually reaches people where they're at right now.,375,,
889,0.97,7390.883,7392.118,People are staying home.,375,,
890,0.97,7392.184,7393.953,They're staying in their neighborhoods.,375,,
891,0.97,7394.019,7397.89,They're staying in their local communities and they're walking more.,375,,
892,0.97,7397.957,7402.561,And making it more Assessable for people to purchase goods and services in their neighborhood.,375,,
893,0.97,7402.628,7423.382,"Allow for those entrepreneurs to be able to open the front of their shops or their garages and be able to sell to the pedestrians and bikers and potentially the folks who are going through the neighborhood as they, get out and start to enjoy spring and hopefully are Vaccinated and actually get a chance to walk around our neighborhoods more.",375,,
894,0.97,7423.449,7425.05,This is an economic stimulus bill.,375,,
895,0.97,7425.117,7428.12,I think it's important to reiterate what we talked about last week as well.,375,,
896,0.97,7428.187,7445.471,This is not just about helping those entrepreneurs who need additional system or helping to cut through the red tape this is also about how we create more dollars in the pockets of residents across the city who are then able to spend that money in existing local businesses.,375,,
897,0.97,7445.538,7467.092,This is not going to be a businesses . existing the more we allow for financial stability it pays forward . people spend that money in local shops and local restaurants and vendors.,375,,
898,0.97,7467.159,7476.235,"So this is truly one small way, a very important way for us to help our smallest employers and future entrepreneurs in the city.",375,,
899,0.97,7476.302,7502.828,"Whether that's the next Microsoft or the next tasty Tacos or what have you, and still want that fried bread, and not having Signage on the street that's not a good way to start this year.",375,,
900,0.97,7502.895,7508.2,We're making it easier for us to do that and we're addressing the concerns as well in this bill.,375,,
901,0.97,7508.267,7516.041,I want to thank the Council President's staff and my staff . Andre Houston did a lot of work on this bill.,375,,
902,0.97,7516.108,7520.346,Thank you very much for the work.,375,,
903,0.97,7520.412,7537.096,"Part of that research of how we clear curb sides to make more opportunities for folks to be able to see small businesses was to think about how this isn't just about access to parking in front of businesses, this is about how we make it a more Walkable thriving neighborhood.",375,,
904,0.97,7537.162,7554.613,Looking forward to what we can do to change to improve the experience in the future . look forward to working with all of you and looking forward to passing this.,375,,
905,0.97,7554.68,7560.619,Thank you thank you so much Council member Mosqueda.,375,,
906,0.97,7560.686,7563.155,Next up is Council member Morales.,375,,
907,0.97,7563.222,7570.462,"Thank you Council President, I'm really excited about this bill so I want to thanks Council member Strauss for the work you've been doing to bring this forward.",375,,
908,0.97,7570.529,7579.939,I think it really speaks to the fact that we need to fundamentally change the way we offer opportunity to our neighbors.,375,,
909,0.97,7580.005,7586.211,We know that Microbusinesses play an important role in generating income for some families.,375,,
910,0.97,7586.278,7598.958,"In my previous life, I provided technical assistance to food based businesses who were trying to get started, trying to expand and very often these are shops that are owned by just family members.",375,,
911,0.97,7599.024,7599.992,There aren't a lot of employees.,375,,
912,0.97,7600.059,7608.867,It is you know mom and pop maybe one or two of the kids and it is very important revenue that they are bringing in for their families.,375,,
913,0.97,7608.934,7617.576,Through that process I learned how hard it is for these family businesses to expand into brick and mortar.,375,,
914,0.97,7617.643,7652.711,You know commercial space is often too big for some of these very small start UPS or too expensive or the tenant improvements that would be required are cost prohibitive . We have a lot of work to do to make it easier for those who don't have easy access to capital to get their foot in the door for Entrepreneurship to expand the goods and services that we're able to offer in our communities I think this is a very important first step to make sure that happens.,375,,
915,0.97,7652.778,7661.72,I look forward to what we can learn through this process . I want to thank the sponsor and cosponsor for starting this conversation for us.,375,,
916,0.97,7661.787,7662.321,Thank you.,375,,
917,0.97,7662.388,7665.324,Thank you Council Morales.,376,,
918,0.97,7665.391,7670.095,Are there any additional comments on the bill?,376,,
919,0.97,7670.162,7690.482,"Okay, I would like to make some comments on the bill as well . I am really enthusiastic about being able to support this legislative effort in partnership with Council member Strauss and also with the support of Council member Mosqueda.",376,,
920,0.97,7690.549,7702.995,I do want to thank Noah from your office Council member Strauss for the work they've done.,376,,
921,0.97,7703.062,7711.303,"The good policy work they've done on behalf of our offices, and big thanks to Keto Freeman as well for all of his work in this space as well.",376,,
922,0.97,7711.37,7720.012,I believe that this bill is going to be just one of many strategies that will help us with our economic recovery from Covid-19.,376,,
923,0.97,7720.079,7745.904,We know that we need flexibility and invasion . This is local government meeting invasion by entrepreneurs who want to try out ideas and provide needed income for their households . This bill will help lower barriers like capital or Affordability that will keep many women and others from starting a business.,376,,
924,0.97,7745.971,7752.478,The bill will strengthen neighborhoods and get us closer to complete neighborhoods with amenities for Seattle residents and families.,376,,
925,0.97,7752.544,7766.024,At a time when it's not just important to support our local small business to ensure they'll still be with us on the other side of the pandemic . It's also important to create flexibility and options.,376,,
926,0.97,7766.091,7771.897,This bill will help lower barriers like access to capital and women from starting a business.,376,,
927,0.97,7771.964,7788.514,With many out of work during a pandemic this change can help Seattle residents start a small business to add much needed income to their households . This will only help us to get that much closer to economic recovery and add amenities to our neighborhood.,376,,
928,0.97,7788.58,7798.223,This bill helps us get to better connected neighborhoods which means we don't need to go far when services and amenities are within a 10 to 15 minute walk or bike ride.,376,,
929,0.97,7798.29,7818.243,"This bill means it will be easier for people to start their dream of being a small business owner and help us get back to a city of vibrant small businesses all across the city . It will support invasion and provide a path way for people to build their business, clientele and grow Capitol in hand for their business.",376,,
930,0.97,7818.31,7821.547,We want every single business to grow out of their garage and store front.,376,,
931,0.97,7821.613,7831.957,You need a lot of money to do that and this bill allows businesses to build at home first before they can take the next big step.,376,,
932,0.97,7832.024,7838.63,"And Lastly, the reality is that our neighborhoods are the center of our universe as this pandemic continues.",376,,
933,0.97,7838.697,7852.144,And while we recover this bill will allow us to continue to limit our travel outside of our homes to stay safer under pandemic protocols by increasing amenities right in our backyard.,376,,
934,0.97,7852.211,7865.157,"So, I am really excited about this bill and I know there's been some conversation about the need to ensure that this is not too broad of a legislative fix.",376,,
935,0.97,7865.224,7871.23,I don't think it's too broad of a legislative fix as Council member Strauss likes to correctly remind us.,376,,
936,0.97,7871.296,7877.669,This is a narrow bill to address a narrow issue within the structure of the land use bill.,376,,
937,0.97,7877.736,7888.714,I did want to take the opportunity to read two testimonials into the record from impacted small business owners.,376,,
938,0.97,7888.78,7890.582,The first is from Kaitlin Brown.,376,,
939,0.97,7890.649,7900.092,She is the owner of yonder cider and she's a supporter of Council bill the bringing business home bill.,376,,
940,0.97,7900.158,7908.1,"And she wrote to us just this afternoon, quote in August 2020 I launched yonder bar.",376,,
941,0.97,7908.166,7911.069,Our retail to go only space in my garage.,376,,
942,0.97,7911.136,7919.044,We launched in the time of Covid and when launching a tasting room with a 7 year commercial least was not possible for us.,376,,
943,0.97,7919.111,7926.718,Launching in my garage helped us to determine its viability and eventually to the signing of a commercial lease just last month.,376,,
