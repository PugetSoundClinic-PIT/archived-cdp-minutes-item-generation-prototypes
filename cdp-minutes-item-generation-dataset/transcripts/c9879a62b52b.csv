69,0.97,395.495,397.663,"Hi, good evening.",15,,
70,0.97,397.663,411.077,"My District Council member Alex Pedersen said the only capacity in which he's willing to Defund Seattle police is through Fissioning what he calls the unjust, inflexible, and expensive policing contract.",15,,
71,0.97,411.077,413.045,I agree it's problematic.,15,,
72,0.97,413.045,416.182,I urge you to think logically.,15,,
73,0.97,416.182,422.221,"Broadly speaking, a contract is one that would pay officers less and hold them to higher standards of accountability.",15,,
74,0.97,422.221,424.19,Officers want the opposite.,15,,
75,0.97,424.19,427.76,So working for the SPD will become less desirable.,15,,
76,0.97,427.76,430.296,Attrition will increase further from its current rate.,15,,
77,0.97,430.296,433.733,Losing officers is only problematic if we keep their scope of work the same.,15,,
78,0.97,433.733,449.081,"On the other hand, if we follow the lead of De-Criminalize Seattle now and Defund the Department as a whole by transferring public safety responsibilities out of the SPD, the number of officers needed would decrease to keep pace with the attrition.",15,,
79,0.97,449.081,453.986,"And in that case, no one loses.",15,,
80,0.97,453.986,459.525,"Council member Pedersen, it is illogical to think it can be reformed without decreasing their scope of work.",15,,
81,0.97,459.525,460.56,Black lives matter.,15,,
82,0.97,460.56,465.364,We need to De-Fund the SPD by 50% at least.,15,,

96,0.97,518.618,546.546,"Other projects and areas in South' sat L, I'd like to talk about are not in my district but the Longhouse, it's very unsafe for pedestrians and visitors unless you park at the parking lot there and the parking lot people are often asked to leave that parking lot for volunteers, Facilitators, and people with accessibility needs.",17,,
97,0.97,546.546,551.25,"There's other parking lots nearby, but they're very dangerous for pedestrians.",17,,
98,0.97,551.25,559.558,And another similar area is Rainier Avenue like the area where Emerald city fish and chips are.,17,,
99,0.97,559.558,562.161,It's a very dangerous for pedestrians.,17,,

116,0.97,633.966,639.372,10 of the 12 investigators are sworn officers and create a huge conflict of interest.,19,,

499,0.97,2538.636,2549.947,"It brings direct cash assistance to the pockets of Seattle's residents and limits the need for city funded services, and we urge your support on each of those three things.",72,,

567,0.97,2776.173,2776.907,My name is Joe Scott.,82,,
568,0.97,2776.907,2780.944,I am a Renter in district 4 of Seattle.,82,,
569,0.97,2780.944,2784.948,I'm on this call today to speak in favor of the solidarity budget.,82,,
570,0.97,2784.948,2792.256,Specifically in favor of amending the Mayor's budget to Defund the police and invest in black communities.,82,,
571,0.97,2792.256,2794.324,What brings me here is a personal story.,82,,
572,0.97,2794.324,2798.028,My bike was recently stolen from my house.,82,,
573,0.97,2798.028,2800.531,I called the police to see what could be done.,82,,
574,0.97,2800.531,2804.701,They told me to set up my own sting.,82,,
575,0.97,2804.701,2806.904,"Best case, we show up and get the guy.",82,,
576,0.97,2806.904,2808.672,"Worst case, he attacks you.",82,,
577,0.97,2808.672,2816.613,"I realized no matter what, involving the police would mean violence, potential harm to an officer and myself, and definite harm to the thief.",82,,
578,0.97,2816.613,2820.517,All over a couple hundred dollars.,82,,
579,0.97,2820.517,2828.525,"I want to affirm the truth that more people are realizing, the police are a violent and ineffective force for providing public safety.",82,,
580,0.97,2828.525,2834.932,We must make Seattle economically just and the solidarity budget would help steer us toward that horizon.,82,,
581,0.97,2834.932,2846.643,I want to give a shout out to the very first Speaker on this call who called out Alex Pedersen specifically for his illogical nonsense statements on this issue.,82,,
582,0.97,2846.643,2850.781,I support his statement.,82,,

590,0.97,2874.838,2888.285,"I want to say that the unity the solidarity budget has brought to the budget process is so inspiring and energizing, and it's good to have votes in these difficult and dark times.",84,,
591,0.97,2888.285,2922.219,"I'm just Wowed by the work of the folks that have led the protest for 150 days and are leading on this budget process and really unifying all of us Seattle for a green new deal, and really happy to see things like the hope program from Council member Morales and really creative solutions that are coming from the community and being brought forth from elects.",84,,

643,0.97,3121.918,3125.222,I'm here today in support of the solidarity budget.,93,,
644,0.97,3125.222,3136.5,One of our demands is you Defund SPD by 50% at least and reinvest those funds in black communities through a budgeting process.,93,,
645,0.97,3136.5,3145.008,Mayor Durkan shouldn't be able to hide behind a self-appointed task force or promises of support.,93,,
646,0.97,3145.008,3147.31,"She promised $100 million to black communities, which is a start.",93,,
647,0.97,3147.31,3157.687,"But that money should come from police, prosecutors, and court budgets and not from the jump start tax that thousands of us worked to make a reality.",93,,
648,0.97,3157.687,3165.295,"The funds were already dedicated to Covid-19 relief and affordable housing, all of which are vital.",93,,
649,0.97,3165.295,3170.367,What isn't vital is punishment of people trying to survive through these over lapping crisis.,93,,
650,0.97,3170.367,3180.61,"With that money, you can work to meet people's basic needs and build other ways of responding to harm in our communities, which will result in the public safety the police claim to provide but do not.",93,,
651,0.97,3180.61,3186.816,Vote for a budget that keeps us all safe and healthy and not just some of us.,93,,
652,0.97,3186.816,3187.717,Thank you.,93,,
653,0.97,3187.717,3188.752,Thank you very much.,94,,

658,0.97,3205.635,3207.103,I live on capital Hill.,95,,
659,0.97,3207.103,3216.279,I urge the Council to Prioritize budget items addressing the climate emergency.,95,,
660,0.97,3216.279,3219.916,I ask you to restore the funding to the Osc.,95,,
661,0.97,3219.916,3227.123,These planning positions are critical to being able to making forward progress on climate change.,95,,
662,0.97,3227.123,3232.929,We'll lose three years of progress because we won't be prepared when we do have more resources.,95,,
663,0.97,3232.929,3241.605,The jump start revenue should be directed to Weatherization and affordable housing.,95,,
664,0.97,3241.605,3245.242,I support the mask proposal.,95,,
665,0.97,3245.242,3252.148,"With Covid-19, the need for Biking and walking has increased tremendously.",95,,
666,0.97,3252.148,3258.188,We should Prioritize those projects in the South sound where the need is greatest.,95,,
667,0.97,3258.188,3258.755,Thanks very much.,95,,
668,0.97,3258.755,3264.06,Thank you for your time tonight.,96,,

673,0.97,3273.87,3277.24,"And as others have already said, a budget is a moral document.",97,,
674,0.97,3277.24,3289.719,And so Mayor Durkan's budget is clearly immoral because it unnecessarily cuts too many of our essential public services right in the midst of multiple crisis we're facing.,97,,
675,0.97,3289.719,3291.988,It will only worsen these crisis.,97,,
676,0.97,3291.988,3304.868,We have to reject Osterity and pay for the vital investments we need to address these crisis by increasing and extending taxes on big businesses and the rich because they are the ones who have to pay for this crisis.,97,,
677,0.97,3304.868,3314.044,Their exploitation of our Regressive tax structure in Seattle and Washington has created this crisis.,97,,
678,0.97,3314.044,3324.187,By concentrating absurd amounts of wealth in the hands of the ultra rich where the wealth is least likely to be spent on the public interest.,97,,
679,0.97,3324.187,3331.728,"Increase money for affording housing, emergency group programs, and a green new deal.",97,,
680,0.97,3331.728,3331.961,Thanks.,97,,
681,0.97,3331.961,3335.565,Thank you for your time.,98,,

686,0.97,3347.444,3359.522,I'm calling to urge you to lead with courage in this historical moment and divest from SPD by at least 50% and support distribution of funds divested through a budgeting process.,99,,
687,0.97,3359.522,3370.4,I and others in my congregation are asking you to invest in black communities and Community- led health and safety led with divestment from SPD.,99,,
688,0.97,3370.4,3379.943,"As a faithful leader, I urge you not to let community needs be pitted against each other but see systemic racism and climate justice are all the same fight.",99,,
689,0.97,3379.943,3392.155,Another world is possible if you make the brave choices today to be leaders who take seriously the needs of those among us who live closest to the margins of society.,99,,
690,0.97,3392.155,3393.923,We endorse the solidarity budget.,99,,

707,0.97,3485.648,3490.62,Diversity and shelter options are necessary for moving forward.,101,,
708,0.97,3490.62,3493.957,Cookie cutter shelters and villages do not fit all people.,101,,
709,0.97,3493.957,3497.126,We must build a variety.,101,,

1080,0.97,5319.947,5328.956,But I do want to note it appears that you need to push Star 6 after you hear the prompt that you have been Unmuted.,156,,
1081,0.97,5328.956,5333.161,That might be where things are getting a little cross ways.,156,,

1144,0.97,5603.564,5607.935,I want to talk about the Seattle Street SINKS.,164,,
1145,0.97,5607.935,5610.171,I've been volunteering for them for the last three months.,164,,
1146,0.97,5610.171,5613.007,I want to tell you a little bit about that project.,164,,
1147,0.97,5613.007,5626.621,It is just a really concrete suggestion for how we can spend money in just a small amount of budget and do real tangible good in our communities and reaching the people who need it.,164,,
1148,0.97,5626.621,5633.294,The street sink project is asking money to install 63 SINKS or nine in every district.,164,,

1150,0.97,5637.665,5639.266,It brings dignity and community spirit.,164,,
1151,0.97,5639.266,5643.738,There are these really cool planter boxes you get that recycles the water.,164,,
1152,0.97,5643.738,5649.143,"It goes a long way toward promoting public health, which we know impacts everyone.",164,,
1153,0.97,5649.143,5656.417,"For example, just one Street sink in the U-District provides hundreds of hand washes every week.",164,,
1154,0.97,5656.417,5659.854,And so 63 of those would do an incredible impact on the city.,164,,
1155,0.97,5659.854,5661.355,The project is already working.,164,,
1156,0.97,5661.355,5668.963,"All we need is for you to get behind it, support it, and it's just going to be a really cool thing for our city.",164,,

1165,0.97,5685.079,5690.317,Some have argued that redirecting police funding to community programs can't be done in one step.,166,,
1166,0.97,5690.317,5694.021,We have to wait to see if they work before taking cops off the street.,166,,
1167,0.97,5694.021,5701.595,The results from other cities have shown this works.,166,,
1168,0.97,5701.595,5710.771,"In Eugene, 191 calls are handled by trained callers than police.",166,,
1169,0.97,5710.771,5715.409,Now this is being Replicated in at least four other cities.,166,,
1170,0.97,5715.409,5719.513,Another argument against it is that civilian responders could be placed in danger.,166,,
1171,0.97,5719.513,5722.149,But the facts don't bear this out.,166,,
1172,0.97,5722.149,5730.458,"With less than 1% needing police backup, the data showed people experiencing mental crisis are overwhelmingly not dangerous.",166,,
1173,0.97,5730.458,5733.728,An armed response escalates into a conflict that could have been avoided.,166,,
1174,0.97,5733.728,5739.934,"Taking these calls out of the police Department doesn't get us all the way to 50%, but it can get us a lot of the way there.",166,,
1175,0.97,5739.934,5751.145,"Since a quarter of police shootings involve someone experiencing mental distress, reducing the number of these interactions is in everyone's interest.",166,,

1177,0.97,5751.479,5752.079,Thank you.,167,,

1207,0.97,5874.435,5880.741,To get that money promptly to black and Brown restorative justice programs and other community programs.,170,,
1208,0.97,5880.741,5890.15,I am still very concerned about the Mayor using the jump start Seattle money to cover the cost of budget cuts.,170,,
1209,0.97,5890.15,5898.359,We fought really hard for that money and specifically for it to go to affordable housing.,170,,
1210,0.97,5898.359,5905.499,"And also specifically, the first $18 million of it to go to affordable housing in the central district.",170,,

1212,0.97,5911.538,5912.539,That's very important.,170,,
1213,0.97,5912.539,5917.211,And working people and poor people do not need to pay for this crisis they did not create.,170,,
1214,0.97,5917.211,5918.979,Let's go where the money is.,170,,
1215,0.97,5918.979,5920.814,The corporations have it.,170,,
