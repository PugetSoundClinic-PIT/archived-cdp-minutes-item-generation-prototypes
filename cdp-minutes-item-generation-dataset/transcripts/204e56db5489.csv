72,0.97,689.388,692.024,Ask yourself why the code change even surfaced now?,13,,
73,0.97,692.024,697.263,Did the parks Department ask to put in an indoor sports facility?,13,,

75,0.97,697.63,701.0,Did anyone decide to ask for this?,13,,
76,0.97,701.0,702.201,No.,14,,
77,0.97,702.201,717.783,Why would you allow this in a industrial area when both the planning Commission and Mayor's industrial and Maritime strategy Council recently said close the loopholes that have allowed too many Non-Industrial uses to be served in limited IG zone land.,14,,
78,0.97,717.783,724.89,Instead the Mayor wants to reopen a new loophole.,14,,

82,0.97,741.107,747.746,The Seattle storm can have a practice facility in a commercial zone elsewhere where in the city.,14,,
83,0.97,747.746,758.157,"And given the stated public benefits to opening the facility to B Ipo C kids, placing it between Queen Anne and magnolia is a striking contradiction.",14,,
84,0.97,758.157,767.867,"If the goal is disparate between men and women in professional sport, then the storm practice field belongs in the Stadium district.",14,,
85,0.97,767.867,773.305,Same as basketball fans Chris Hansen has a lot of spare property there.,14,,
86,0.97,773.305,784.083,"If you are going to Dedowngrade an industrial area for sport, this is obviously place to do it.",14,,

96,0.97,827.393,835.367,It seems very different than what we have called on.,17,,
97,0.97,835.367,855.421,"For example, magnolia, the housing above the grocery store for years . They have gotten a fast pass.",17,,
98,0.97,855.421,859.191,"Absolutely love the storm, Championing our great women's basketball team.",17,,
99,0.97,859.191,861.594,Proud to have you in the city.,17,,
100,0.97,861.594,896.996,"They absolutely deserve a practice facility, but the land committee looks to how we make our industrial Maritime Standard and residential zoning changes over the next comprehensive plan update, just think about how this process is in contrast to the housing that we need and the housing crisis and how slow that is and how quickly and evenly without a lot of public knowledge to understand what was going on as we move forward.",17,,
101,0.97,896.996,905.104,"I will look into that moon Jae- in sight, articles and wasn't mentioned in the article.",17,,

111,0.97,960.459,969.835,We have two young active children and I hope the committee gives significant weight directly impacted by this proposal.,21,,
112,0.97,969.835,974.406,I strongly advocate in favor of changes that would make facilities Leek this possible.,21,,
113,0.97,974.406,991.423,I would love to say I am raising range resilient children but the Northwest brings inclement weather that makes physical activity and recreational play a real challenge in the winter months.,21,,
114,0.97,991.423,996.595,I think you only need to look at the early success of an exempt rare committee.,21,,
115,0.97,996.595,1006.038,I signed my son up for the hockey program and astonished with the use just last night.,21,,

118,0.97,1014.947,1041.573,The main draw back my family is required to make the trek from magnolia to the edge of the city to avail this incredible facility so I would like to say we move forward as proposed so people can enjoy the facility for health and wellness.,21,,

135,0.97,1137.369,1141.273,I can go and kick us off.,25,,
136,0.97,1141.273,1143.542,"Adrian Thompson, the policy director for Mayor Durkan.",25,,
137,0.97,1143.542,1158.957,"I want to thank you, chair Strauss and members of the Committeetors present this morning to you an exciting opportunity on behalf of Mayor Durkan we are excited to present Council bill 120-149 to the city council this morning.",25,,
138,0.97,1158.957,1170.102,"While director and the Opcd team will be going into more of the detail, I wanted to provide you all a high level overview of why the Mayor transcended this legislation.",25,,
139,0.97,1170.102,1190.923,"We as a city have looked for ways to support sports and recreational facilities in the same way we Prioritized the Stadium district, home to men's sports teams such as the mariner, Sounders and Seahawks and we have celebrated the soon to be open climate pledge arena and the new practice facilities for the latest men's sports team the Kraken.",25,,
140,0.97,1190.923,1202.234,"Over the past several mayoral administrations there has been a healthy tension within the Maritime and industrial community, residents, housing and others to determine the future of our industrial lands.",25,,
141,0.97,1202.234,1215.681,The Mayor convened over the past two years through Covid-19 a Stakeholder engagement process that produced a set of recommendations that strengthened to protect our industrial lands.,25,,
142,0.97,1215.681,1226.892,"Working directly with Stakeholders and city Council, Opcd has moved forward on Cepa, will conduct a comprehensive study and legislation to be taken up by Kim later this year.",25,,
143,0.97,1226.892,1235.601,We heard from some Stakeholders that we as a city need to find more ways to support sports and recreational facilities.,25,,
144,0.97,1235.601,1249.248,This legislation before you today that you are considering is compatible with both the goal to protect our industrial lands and support an indoor recreational facility to enable sports facilities in very limited industrial uses.,25,,
145,0.97,1249.248,1262.594,"Compared to other uses such as large offices and retail development, indoor sports and reaction does not create as much of a demand for trips and visits by Non-Industrial users.",25,,
146,0.97,1262.594,1267.299,This legislation does not apply to spectator sports facilities.,25,,
147,0.97,1267.299,1274.373,Indoor sports and reaction structures are similar and physical characteristics to industrial structures.,25,,
148,0.97,1274.373,1284.783,"Further, the limiting criteria contained in the legislation prevents location of an indoor sports and reaction facility anywhere in the bulk of industrial or Maritime zone land.",25,,
149,0.97,1284.783,1293.892,"Úby passing this legislation, sports teams such as the Seattle storm, which has not historically had an advocate in city hall, will have more options available to build local facilities.",25,,
150,0.97,1293.892,1304.136,I am going to now turn the presentation over to director Andando.,25,,

152,0.97,1304.67,1329.027,My comments will be brief as I want to turn it over to our expert . I appreciate the audience today and the presentation.,26,,
153,0.97,1329.027,1332.264,I look forward to a discussion there after.,26,,
154,0.97,1332.264,1347.546,I have been very proud to be involved in our industrial Maritime strategy work with our Stakeholders and what we have lifted up in terms of the 11 strategies that we are now seeing forward.,26,,
155,0.97,1347.546,1350.082,Legislation this year and our EIS process.,26,,
156,0.97,1350.082,1354.386,A lot of great work ahead.,26,,
157,0.97,1354.386,1373.138,And I think that the legislation that we are speaking about today is not consistent with the larger body of work so now to Jeff who will pull up the slide with additional information for you to consider.,26,,
158,0.97,1377.809,1381.012,"Thank you, Rico.",27,,

161,0.97,1384.916,1385.217,Great.,29,,
162,0.97,1385.217,1391.99,I will be providing you with a very brief overview of the proposed legislation.,29,,
163,0.97,1391.99,1397.329,"So, here is a summary of what is contained in the legislation.",29,,
164,0.97,1397.329,1413.211,"The proposal would increase is maximum size of use limit for indoor sports and recreational uses in industrial general zones from a current 10,000 square feet maximum to a 50,000 square foot maximum.",29,,
165,0.97,1413.211,1423.755,Legislation includes several limiting criteria that are intended to minimize any potential adverse impact on our manufacturing and industrial centers.,29,,
166,0.97,1423.755,1424.856,So those criteria are as follows.,29,,
167,0.97,1424.856,1432.23,It would have to be located in the Ballard inner Bay North end manufactured industrial center.,29,,
168,0.97,1432.23,1462.494,"The facility would have to be within 300 feet of an existing neighborhood commercial or Seattle mix zone so that targets, potential locations to the EMS of industrial areas near mixed use neighborhoods the facility could have to be within a quarter mile of a Seattle park with active reaction use, so this is intended to create functional clusters of recreational facilities.",29,,
169,0.97,1462.494,1471.837,The facility could not be within 500 feet of a shoreline and that is to preserve shoreline areas for Maritime uses which are Prioritized.,29,,
170,0.97,1471.837,1489.621,And a new facility could not be within one mile of another indoor sports and recreation facility larger than 25 feet so this would prevent proliferation of too many facilities in one area.,29,,
171,0.97,1489.621,1499.931,"The legislation would also decrease the amount of required parking from one space per 500 square feet to one space per 2,000 square feet.",29,,
172,0.97,1499.931,1508.84,This is intended to minimize the amount of expansive surface parking that would be associated with the facility.,29,,
173,0.97,1508.84,1519.551,The benefits of the proposal as it has been discussed creates potential new recreational and training opportunities for Athletics and camps.,29,,
174,0.97,1519.551,1537.836,"The limiting criteria minimize impacts on nearby industrial activities and as was mentioned, indoor sports and reaction can be compatible with a industrial context compared to many other potential uses.",29,,
175,0.97,1537.836,1542.507,This is the map that shows how limited the potential areas are.,29,,
176,0.97,1542.507,1561.092,"The gray shade on this map, please note that North is to the right of your screen, are the industrial general zones and the hatched areas are the shoreline Buffers where a facility could not be located.",29,,
177,0.97,1561.092,1574.472,"The green indicates parks that have active recreational uses, and the last, the blue with the yellow outline shows the remaining eligible areas according to our analysis.",29,,
178,0.97,1574.472,1578.576,And with that I will conclude the presentation.,29,,
179,0.97,1595.827,1608.773,"Am I correct that this proposal does not change or add new using to the industrial general 2, is that correct?",30,,
180,0.97,1608.773,1609.908,That is correct.,31,,
181,0.97,1609.908,1610.141,Okay,32,,
182,0.97,1610.141,1615.747,"In this legislation, legislation, since you just mentioned, is not changing uses.",33,,
183,0.97,1615.747,1623.922,"It is my understanding this legislation is simply changing the size of a use that is already allowed, is that correct?",33,,
184,0.97,1623.922,1628.927,"That is also correct R. it increases from 10,000 to 50,000.",34,,
185,0.97,1628.927,1629.361,Okay.,35,,
186,0.97,1629.361,1641.172,"And when I was reading the director's report, was I correct in read that there are up to 4 Pa parcels that could be affected by this change?",35,,
187,0.97,1641.172,1641.439,Yes.,36,,
188,0.97,1641.439,1654.152,Those are my questions for now.,37,,
189,0.97,1654.152,1655.62,"Colleague, do you have questions?",37,,
190,0.97,1655.62,1660.158,Mr. chair?,38,,

193,0.97,1667.665,1672.704,Do you want us to speak to this now or--because that is what I am wondering.,39,,
194,0.97,1672.704,1682.514,"I do want the speak to this but I am wondering if the presentation is over, if this is the time you want us to do it, or if this is just questions about the Powerpoint?",39,,
195,0.97,1682.514,1683.615,I would say both.,40,,
196,0.97,1683.615,1685.917,"If up something you would like to say, take it away.",40,,
197,0.97,1685.917,1694.826,"It is a lot, but I want to make sure everybody has their say be ever I say anything more, before we go to a vote.",41,,
198,0.97,1694.826,1695.126,Mr. chair?,41,,
199,0.97,1695.126,1696.928,Copy.,42,,

201,0.97,1699.831,1714.846,"Not today, as per usual I like to have items in my Committee at least twice before voting, so I thought Councilmember Pedersen, he may have questions and then we will come back to you, Councilmember Juarez.",42,,
202,0.97,1714.846,1715.113,Okay.,43,,
203,0.97,1715.113,1716.848,"Kim member Pedersen, take it away.",44,,
204,0.97,1716.848,1728.159,"Thank you and thank you for giving us chances to consider the legislation today with the public hearing, discussion and giving us time between that to actually vote on it.",45,,
205,0.97,1728.159,1732.564,And I very much--I want to support the Seattle storm.,45,,
206,0.97,1732.564,1748.346,"I agree with sue bird's comments about the need to lift up women's supports in our city from an urban planning perspective the land use legislation seems to be structured well with the limitations, setbacks and other restrictions.",45,,
207,0.97,1748.346,1754.152,"I am concerned, though, about the issues raised by Kevin on the city council Blog insight.",45,,
208,0.97,1754.152,1766.498,"I want to make sure when we get to Friday, at least for myself, I want to make sure we are doing what is appropriate and not creating any risks to the city, undue risks to the city.",45,,
209,0.97,1766.498,1769.3,I will be Culting with the city attorney's office between now and then.,45,,

211,0.97,1780.044,1785.817,"So, that is--I guess the question for central staff, thank you for the memo.",45,,
212,0.97,1785.817,1802.033,It was very helpful it doesn't mention the Seattle storm so I am trying to reconcile is this about the Seattle storm or is it just providing a general change to the code?,45,,
213,0.97,1802.033,1819.918,"So, as you heard in testimony, the idea was raised by the Seattle storm by the provisions of the bill would apply to multiple sites including many properties not owned by the storm.",46,,
214,0.97,1819.918,1821.219,Thank you.,47,,
215,0.97,1821.219,1824.355,Thank you Councilmember.,48,,

224,0.97,1849.047,1852.55,We have been working on this legislation and discussing different places.,51,,
225,0.97,1852.55,1855.286,I want to do different background and history.,51,,
226,0.97,1855.286,1857.622,This conversation didn't just pop up.,51,,
227,0.97,1857.622,1869.1,"I don't get my information and my analysis and research from writers, whether it is Kevin at the times, I don't do that.",51,,
228,0.97,1869.1,1870.668,I do my own work.,51,,
229,0.97,1870.668,1882.413,So let me roll back something quickly and I will have more to say Friday when we vote.,51,,
230,0.97,1882.413,1884.249,I will say this again.,51,,
231,0.97,1884.249,1885.95,Miss guilder does own the property.,51,,
232,0.97,1885.95,1886.684,This is private property.,51,,
233,0.97,1886.684,1887.285,We know that.,51,,
234,0.97,1887.285,1890.021,What is wrong if it is about the Seattle storm?,51,,
235,0.97,1890.021,1896.427,"When we deal with and dealt with any of our major sports team, nobody ever questions it.",51,,
236,0.97,1896.427,1897.729,"That question never comes up, ever.",51,,
237,0.97,1897.729,1904.903,But I want to take us back in a time machine for a moment for you all to think about this when we vote on Friday.,51,,
238,0.97,1904.903,1943.975,"Those of us that were here in May of 2016, those of us that voted against a street vacation, Councilmember is a want, Herbold, Kim member--and myself, we believed tax should not be taken away from them for the use of private benefit and we didn't think the public benefit was that great.",51,,
239,0.97,1943.975,1945.376,It with out Street vacation.,51,,
240,0.97,1945.376,1947.078,It would require tax payer money.,51,,
241,0.97,1947.078,1948.546,I could go on and on.,51,,
242,0.97,1948.546,1955.086,"So, when people keep bringing up that situation that happened in 2016, that is not what we are dealing with today.",51,,
243,0.97,1955.086,1965.196,We are dealing with a group of people that already tone property to expand a Footprint for a use that is already consistent.,51,,
244,0.97,1965.196,1970.268,With are not talking about thousands of people coming in to watch a spectator sport.,51,,
245,0.97,1970.268,1980.378,It is a training facility for a team which we didn't have in 2016 that has won four initial championships.,51,,
246,0.97,1980.378,1984.482,"You all know that, I will go into that.",51,,
247,0.97,1984.482,1987.518,"There is a difference between shovel ready, which was said?",51,,
248,0.97,1987.518,1995.827,"2016, which is not true, and shovel hungry, and what we have here is shovel ready.",51,,
249,0.97,1995.827,2002.333,"I don't want to spend too much time belaboring yes, it is important we support women's sports and all those issue, of course.",51,,
250,0.97,2002.333,2006.437,We will hear from probably more people on Friday.,51,,
251,0.97,2006.437,2008.773,This wasn't some Nefarious deal behind Closed-Doors.,51,,
252,0.97,2008.773,2018.049,"I would Leek the know where these back door rooms are, where there are cigars being smoked, because I haven't been there.",51,,
253,0.97,2018.049,2019.951,It has been pretty straightforward.,51,,
254,0.97,2019.951,2031.896,"We have worked really well with our labor brothers and sisters, with our friends at the port, with our Maritime friend, with Stakeholders.",51,,
255,0.97,2031.896,2042.173,"I also sit on sound transit so I understand what some of their concerns were about potential issues with Lightrail, which would be 16 years from now.",51,,
256,0.97,2042.173,2054.685,"We know that there are thousands of parcels that sound transit has to look at to make anything happen with eminent domain, so we just don't know.",51,,
257,0.97,2054.685,2056.788,We are at 10% design there.,51,,
258,0.97,2056.788,2059.49,I don't want go down that rabbit hole.,51,,
259,0.97,2059.49,2068.599,"There is more information, it is all on the record, if people ask for it, I am one of those people that if you ask for it, I will give it to you.",51,,
260,0.97,2068.599,2070.201,You don't need to Pdr me to death.,51,,
261,0.97,2070.201,2071.702,I have nothing to hide.,51,,
262,0.97,2071.702,2073.304,I want to say one last thing.,51,,
263,0.97,2073.304,2089.687,"I really like--I don't know who this gentlemen was, but what he said about--when we look at our different districts and look at what economic vitality is and particular buildings, it isn't just brick and mortar.",51,,
264,0.97,2089.687,2094.092,"It is a sense of place, it is about what it brings.",51,,
265,0.97,2094.092,2108.039,"Having Lightrail, having our John Lewis bridge, all that many coming together does more than just, you know, provide transportation a place to watch the Kraken practice or Pus on ice skates.",51,,
266,0.97,2108.039,2109.14,It bring as sense of place.,51,,
267,0.97,2109.14,2112.477,"It activates a community, it had us that lifting that we need.",51,,
268,0.97,2112.477,2146.544,"I don't think anyone here today or anyone watching cannot say that the storm has not lifted us, that they have not represented us, that they had not been there for us, so I don't have a problem saying or questioning why can't it be for the Seattle storm, because we sure as hell tried to do it in 2016 when we didn't even have a team and we weren't even in the franchise or the running and this city went crazy for a team that left them 14 years ago, when we have a team here now that has won four national championships.",51,,
269,0.97,2146.544,2150.281,"Now, I know I will probably get a lot of hate mail like I got last time.",51,,
270,0.97,2150.281,2151.516,Bring the death threats.,51,,
271,0.97,2151.516,2160.391,"That being said, being a lawyer myself, and I will say this boldly and bluntly, it is not a spot zone, so have fun with that.",51,,
272,0.97,2160.391,2169.267,"And I will just leave it at that and hopefully we can go to a vote today and get this over with, but if we need to go to Friday, that is fine, too.",51,,
273,0.97,2169.267,2182.413,"I will encourage those of you that want to step up and support not just the Seattle storm, but really women's sports and doing that.",51,,
274,0.97,2182.413,2187.385,Because we don't do that and should do that and shame on us for not doing that.,51,,
275,0.97,2187.385,2192.59,And I will leave it at that.,51,,
276,0.97,2192.59,2192.89,Thank you.,51,,
277,0.97,2192.89,2194.125,Thank you Councilmember Juarez.,52,,
278,0.97,2194.125,2204.602,"The parcels that Jeff shared on the man, potential 45 parcels in looked like three different zone, those zones are in district 6 and in district 7.",52,,
279,0.97,2204.602,2212.61,"Councilmember Lewis, the District Councilmember from district 7 is a member of this Committee.",52,,
280,0.97,2212.61,2214.145,"Councilmember Lewis, take it boy.",52,,
281,0.97,2214.145,2215.58,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,53,,
282,0.97,2215.58,2223.387,"Unfortunately I am on my phone today, but definitely happy to be heard out on this.",53,,
283,0.97,2223.387,2242.773,"You know, I--I first wanted to say at the top, I am a very big supporter of this change and I don't want to get into responding to, and Litigating any of the armchair Lawyering that may have been out in the world on this.",53,,
284,0.97,2242.773,2252.383,"You know, I actually concur with Councilmember Juarez's assessment that this is not a spot zone and I would stand by that, as well, and totally agree.",53,,
285,0.97,2252.383,2269.133,"But I would rather pivot this and talk, since I do represent district 7, more about the unique Ecosystem of the business community that is north of Dravis, east of the railway grade, and West of 15th Avenue.",53,,
286,0.97,2269.133,2305.836,"The little slice of inner Bay that we are discussing about, because, you know, to agree with Councilmember Juarez, again, you know, this isn't just about the storm, but if folks are going to make it about the storm, let's put that front an center and talk not just about the big civic contributions the storm makes to our city, but the contributions that the storm's plans for a parcel in this anybody, this nearby will do for the neighborhood.",53,,
287,0.97,2305.836,2350.014,"I think it is important when we talk about industrial land, Councilmember, like you who grew up in Ballard, in a Ballard very much dominated by the Maritime industrial community and know that the community builds strong families, that that community provide goods job, that it provides upward mobility, that it provides opportunity, that it produces one of the biggest fishing fleet, that we do want to hang on to that critical industrial core because once we lose it it isn't coming back.",53,,
288,0.97,2350.014,2359.557,"So when we look at doing things in places that are historically designated Maritime industrial use, that it be heightened to a level of scrutiny.",53,,
289,0.97,2359.557,2371.369,"Let's talk a little about the elephant in the room, and talk about what it will do to change the activation to that site in this neighborhood.",53,,
290,0.97,2371.369,2372.77,We are not displacing any current industrial use.,53,,
291,0.97,2372.77,2377.208,This is not a site that is a shipyard.,53,,
292,0.97,2377.208,2379.91,This is not a site employees Maritime jobs.,53,,
293,0.97,2379.91,2385.149,No Maritime jobs will be lost with the Seattle storm putting a practice facility on the site.,53,,
294,0.97,2385.149,2408.639,"This site is a single storage yard with a bunch of old Rvs and boats, pleasure boats for the most Mart, not boats of industry, that for decades has either been that or a completely vacant lot, Unactivated, no interest in the tenant taking on the site.",53,,
295,0.97,2408.639,2434.064,"If we are talking about creating the dynamic naked and communities that Councilmember Juarez just alluded to, we need to be creative in looking at ways for our code to take advantage of and be Adaptive to bring in legacy tenants that will undeniable make a big contribution to neighborhoods like this storm practice facility.",53,,
296,0.97,2434.064,2437.735,This neighborhood that is seeing an incredibly large amount of change.,53,,
297,0.97,2437.735,2448.345,"I don't know if anybody has been by the intersection of 15th and Dravis, but there is a significant amount of clusters of new apartment buildings.",53,,
298,0.97,2448.345,2463.194,"The district has survived for many decades with a number of businesses that cater the surrounding neighborhood, not just for Maritime industrial purpose, but for basic retail, grocery and restaurants.",53,,
299,0.97,2463.194,2498.329,"It is frankly not the best use for this business district to have a static storage yard sitting there not contributing in a broad sense to the activation of the neighborhood, not contributing to the density of job opportunity, not contributing to this entity of pedestrian traffic in a business district, frankly not contributing to Theceps of public safety by having another activation with eyes on the street for potential Criminalized activity in the neighborhood.",53,,
300,0.97,2498.329,2505.269,We know people that live or work in the neighborhood are informal Guardian os place and provide an activation.,53,,
301,0.97,2505.269,2517.448,"So I think we are looking at what this is going to do for the Ecosystem that is, again, North of Dravis, West of 15th, east of the railway grade.",53,,
302,0.97,2517.448,2530.361,"This is undeniably going to form a Hub right at the center of it that will have an extremely positive impact on supporting, catering to, and reinforcing the existing businesses and existing Ecosystem.",53,,
303,0.97,2530.361,2548.479,"I would also say in terms of going back to the legislation more broadly and not focus ongoing the specific site that has been a matter of public contention, that there are safe guards that protect the most critical of our industrial lands, which are the shoring line with industrial spaces.",53,,
304,0.97,2548.479,2573.904,"I do agree, like that has to be a bright red line in the sand on Makingsure that we never give up as a city anymore of our shoreline industrial space, any of our shipyards, any of our places, the fisherman's terminal.",53,,
305,0.97,2573.904,2584.682,"Once those property on the water are gone and go to a commercial or R. use we never get it back, but that is not what we are talking about here.",53,,
306,0.97,2584.682,2596.627,To reinforce that value there is a rule in the legislation that we just heard in the briefing.,53,,
307,0.97,2596.627,2599.229,500 feet away from a shoreline in or to maintain and reinforce that value.,53,,
308,0.97,2599.229,2619.55,"I think the legislation will have a positive impact on my district, a positive impact on inner Bay, and it is going to enhance these Maritime business district, not undermine there.",53,,
309,0.97,2619.55,2625.055,"I am totally happy to defer, vote on this, discuss it again on Friday.",53,,
310,0.97,2625.055,2637.001,"Totally happy to M█Ake space fo other committee members to receive professional legal advice from the city attorney's office, but on Friday I do intend to vote for this legislation.",53,,
311,0.97,2637.001,2649.947,"I certainly appreciate the community member who is have come forward and spoken up for this unique activation in the inner Bay neighborhood and look forward to supporting this, so thank you.",53,,

317,0.97,2706.437,2711.942,That is a very important thing that we need to make sure.,54,,
318,0.97,2711.942,2719.149,"As Councilmember Juarez stated, we were about to bend over backward for a team that left us and was not present.",54,,

341,0.97,3002.132,3006.136,It represents early implementation action of a broader stationary and planning process under way.,64,,
342,0.97,3006.136,3011.208,It is informed by the community's vision for the future of the area.,64,,
343,0.97,3011.208,3017.08,This as captured in the draft plan we released in March.,64,,
344,0.97,3017.08,3035.198,"It demonstrates an early commitment by the city to transit Orient development of the 2025 opening of the station and as I said, there is additional planning under way for potentially broader changes.",64,,
345,0.97,3035.198,3042.372,"The gray area is the station area we have been focusing on, but the planning effort actually covers this broader yellow area.",64,,
346,0.97,3042.372,3054.751,"That process should be complete in the next year to two years, and additional recommendations will come at that time.",64,,
347,0.97,3054.751,3061.258,We had planned to introduce some amendments related to the Maritime strategy but we will wait until next year.,64,,

349,0.97,3094.791,3124.454,"It would be a recommendation for a policy that limits future amendments that change the boundaries to include major updates on the comprehensive plan or following the study of industrial lands and, finally, we anticipate recommending a policy that establishes the city's intent to partner with the state of Washington in a master planning process for any future redevelopment of the Interbay Armory or the Waska site.",64,,
350,0.97,3124.454,3154.384,"Jim, can you confirm that since we are unable to move this section forward at this time due to secret processing issues, can you confirm we will be bringing in an amendment forward on Friday to remove this section of this ordinance?",65,,
351,0.97,3154.384,3156.853,That is my understanding.,66,,

354,0.97,3165.262,3183.179,"We have a proposal to look at earlier proposed amendments relating to tree protection canopy, as well as perhaps casting a broader look at the forestry Commission and ose around looking at potential policies for treatment of the canopy preservation.",68,,
355,0.97,3183.179,3189.92,That is being deferred to the mainly update.,68,,

359,0.97,3211.641,3217.814,And amendments to support transportation impact fees is also an item that Council is pursuing.,68,,

382,0.97,3304.534,3318.214,The other would be to align it with the comprehensive plan major update and the action would be completed by 2024.,80,,

384,0.97,3319.749,3348.978,If anyone is looking at the map it is interesting to see that Roosevelt way begins at the city border at 145Th and Aurora and there is a diagonal to that intersection of 130Th . It is interesting to see how the freeway disconnected the neighborhood in that real physical way that we can no longer use Roosevelt way as it was once connected.,82,,
385,0.97,3348.978,3358.154,One example of many of why we need to Reconnect our neighborhoods by--our freeways.,82,,

392,0.97,3392.088,3396.326,This area is just 25% of the whole block.,83,,

478,0.97,3983.946,3994.19,"This name change was recommended to us by the Seattle planning Commission, and it reflects the reality on the ground today.",99,,

481,0.97,4019.081,4025.021,"Lish, would you like to take us away?",99,,
482,0.97,4025.021,4025.388,Thank you.,100,,
483,0.97,4025.388,4041.237,"So this set of amendments is very simple, but it touches a large number of policies and goals, and discussion sections in the comprehensive plan.",100,,
484,0.97,4041.237,4055.451,"It AMENDS the land use element, parks and open space element, the future land use map to change the name of single family areas to residential family areas.",100,,
485,0.97,4055.451,4070.833,The intent is to better reflect the mix of character and activities that are currently found in what are called single family areas by including a more inclusive name.,100,,
486,0.97,4070.833,4079.508,You had a public hearing on this to get initial feedback from the community at the end of July.,100,,
487,0.97,4079.508,4085.281,Today is the official public hearing on the bill.,100,,
488,0.97,4085.281,4106.435,"After the original public hearing, we did hear from one neighborhood, the Morgan community Association that has requested an amendment that's attached to the agenda, and that would affect the Morgan junction neighborhood plan and the Northgate neighborhood plan.",100,,
489,0.97,4106.435,4112.508,"And with that, I will be available for any questions.",100,,
490,0.97,4112.508,4113.275,Thanks.,101,,
491,0.97,4113.275,4114.21,I have a few.,101,,
492,0.97,4114.21,4116.445,"Then colleagues, if you have questions, we'll take that.",101,,
493,0.97,4116.445,4117.68,I know you said this.,101,,
494,0.97,4117.68,4122.418,I'm going to ask these questions to lift up what you've already said.,101,,
495,0.97,4122.418,4131.427,"Can you confirm this amendment does not change city policy on what is allowed within these zones, and that it only changes the name, is that correct?",101,,
496,0.97,4131.427,4131.76,Correct.,102,,
497,0.97,4131.76,4142.104,"Can you confirm that the amendment listed on the agenda improves the Readability of some plans and again, does not make any substantive changes, is that correct?",103,,
498,0.97,4142.104,4142.938,Correct.,104,,
499,0.97,4142.938,4149.612,"I understand if this passes, the Council may want to take up future legislation to reflect the name change there as well.",105,,
500,0.97,4149.612,4161.423,"Can you also confirm that understanding, that the changes would only be to the name, and again not to zoning policy.",105,,
501,0.97,4161.423,4161.957,Correct.,106,,
502,0.97,4161.957,4175.304,"So if this bill passes, then Council would consider a bill to amend the line use code, making the same changes through the land use code, but not making changes to policy.",106,,
503,0.97,4175.304,4190.719,"This is changing the name to reflect the reality that we are Duplexes and apartment buildings that are built in what is now single family zones, that were not necessarily previous when they were built.",107,,
504,0.97,4190.719,4197.059,"So we are endeavoring so change the name only, to reflect the neighborhoods that we live in.",107,,
505,0.97,4197.059,4205.234,"Colleagues, are there any questions on this bill?",107,,
506,0.97,4205.234,4207.736,"I see Councilmember Peterson, please take it away.",107,,
507,0.97,4207.736,4209.438,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",108,,
508,0.97,4209.438,4224.386,"I do not have any questions, but I do have comments because I received some letters and Emails from community leaders in the District who had concerns about this, and I wanted to explain why I'm likely to support this.",108,,
509,0.97,4224.386,4226.922,So I don't have the questions.,108,,
510,0.97,4226.922,4232.861,Should I save those until Friday?,108,,
511,0.97,4232.861,4235.864,"No, please, either or.",109,,
512,0.97,4235.864,4236.365,Your preference.,109,,
513,0.97,4236.365,4237.199,"Okay, thank you.",110,,
514,0.97,4237.199,4243.038,So you know I really appreciate what our central staff analyst said and the Chairlifted up.,110,,
515,0.97,4243.038,4250.679,This is a name change for what is already the reality on the ground in these geographic areas.,110,,
516,0.97,4250.679,4260.689,"I think the real discussion would be happening, the substantive discussion would be happening at a later time.",110,,
517,0.97,4260.689,4281.176,"There won't be a robust discussion in the future for zoning, but I think what matters to me most in that discussion at least now would be in the future would be that I generally do not support blanket up zones, unless there's a clear and immediate public pen fit, such as on site, very low income housing that's built.",110,,
518,0.97,4281.176,4296.292,"When there's additional density, it's Ideally near frequent transit, and where there's sufficient infrastructure, such as school capacity, and that we put Mitigations in place before the actual substantive Upzones occur.",110,,
519,0.97,4296.292,4307.202,"Such as making sure that we don't Demolish existing nationally, occurring affordable housing.",110,,
520,0.97,4307.202,4309.338,We're mindful of the tree canopy and grow that.,110,,
521,0.97,4309.338,4322.051,"I'm hoping we learned from the mandatory housing and Affordability program, which had a good intention, some benefits, but in my opinion some shortcomings.",110,,
522,0.97,4322.051,4341.97,"I just want to let folks know who did write to my office with concerns, that I'm mindful of those concerns, and that discussion will be happening at a later time, and this name change, it's not substantive at this time.",110,,
523,0.97,4341.97,4342.438,"So thank you, chair.",110,,
524,0.97,4342.438,4347.076,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,111,,
525,0.97,4347.076,4354.883,Any other questions?,111,,
526,0.97,4354.883,4355.617,Councilmember Lewis here.,112,,
527,0.97,4355.617,4358.62,I just want to briefly address this legislation too.,112,,
528,0.97,4358.62,4362.624,I will be voting in favor of it today.,112,,
529,0.97,4362.624,4370.599,"Similar to Councilmember Pedersen, I have heard a number of potential concerns about the impact of this name change.",112,,
530,0.97,4370.599,4387.416,"And you know, I guess I just want to speak generally as someone who represents the district that includes some of our most residentially dense districts in the city in Belltown, South Lake Union, Pioneer square, downtown.",112,,
531,0.97,4387.416,4397.96,"But then also represents some of the least housing dense neighborhoods, magnolia and Queen Anne.",112,,
532,0.97,4397.96,4411.039,"That there are, when you take a walk even around magnolia, and Queen Anne, a significant amount of really attractive multi-family residences.",112,,
533,0.97,4411.039,4418.714,"Be they condos, be they apartments, that exist in part of the neighborhood that do not feel reflected.",112,,
534,0.97,4418.714,4444.907,"And I've talked to people who live in some of those housing placements about how that fits into the definition of single family neighborhood, and that it's confusing to have Fourplexes, Triplexes in some cases in residential neighborhoods.",112,,
535,0.97,4444.907,4461.39,"The ghost of old corner stores, with two stories on top of them, that are now all housing, because those corner stores can no longer really exist, or small houses can no longer exist in areas where they used to flourish and used to serve that surrounding neighborhood.",112,,
536,0.97,4461.39,4470.299,"And I really do think that at the bare minimum, this really is just a conversation of recognizing what already exists.",112,,
537,0.97,4470.299,4490.085,"On Monday, we got the initial ATU report from Sdci indicating in really attractive map form, the density and distribution of the proliferation of new dwelling units, in a lot of these neighborhoods, currently zoned to single family.",112,,
538,0.97,4490.085,4501.597,"And I really do think that moving forward, we should just accept what is true here in the identity of these neighborhoods, and embrace it.",112,,
539,0.97,4501.597,4512.307,"That there is an increasing amount of urban and residential density, and that everybody feel included in in a definition of these neighborhoods.",112,,
540,0.97,4512.307,4534.93,"Certainly, as we move forward, you know, I'm certainly looking forward to the discussions where they can be an increased amount of Dineamism and that I believe is a different conversation than this name change.",112,,
541,0.97,4534.93,4545.774,"I don't say that to devalue the name change, but I say that to indicate that our work isn't done.",112,,
542,0.97,4545.774,4550.712,"To make all the areas of the city, dynamic, diverse, and interesting places to live.",112,,
543,0.97,4550.712,4559.588,"With that, Mr. chair, I appreciate your leadership on moving this forward, and I'm certainly prepared to vote at the chair's pleasure on this.",112,,
544,0.97,4559.588,4562.524,So thank you.,112,,
545,0.97,4562.524,4564.259,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,113,,
546,0.97,4564.259,4566.295,"Councilmember Juarez, anything on this bill?",113,,

551,0.97,4569.932,4577.973,"I won't make any further comments, because you can see that I support it by being a cosponsor.",115,,
552,0.97,4577.973,4587.082,"So we're going to, so again, we previously held a public hearing on this proposal on July 28th to get feedback prior to introducing legislation.",115,,
553,0.97,4587.082,4601.263,"Today, we're holding the additional public hearing on the legislation itself, and then we will vote on this on Friday with the amendment regarding clarifying language of means.",115,,
554,0.97,4601.263,4601.73,That's the process.,115,,
555,0.97,4601.73,4617.145,"We're going to now move into the public hearing, before we open the public hearing, I would ask that everyone be patient as we continue to operate this new system in Realtime, and navigate through the inevitable growing pains.",115,,

587,0.97,4782.711,4805.333,"We currently have a code that lives in the past, that views new housing or diverse housing types, cornerstones, mixed uses as an assault on neighborhood character, rather than part of the great backbone of what makes our neighborhood special.",118,,
588,0.97,4805.333,4806.701,We're endorsing really terrible outcomes.,118,,
589,0.97,4806.701,4817.212,"So if we can't switch up these two words, how are we going to do the much harder work of preparing for all the people that are coming to live here?",118,,

598,0.97,4849.845,4859.421,So my name is Brady Northstromb I'm here today on behalf of the Seattle coalition.,120,,
599,0.97,4859.421,4867.362,Seattle for everyone strongly supports 125155 that AMENDS the comprehensive plan.,120,,

602,0.97,4876.605,4883.278,"And what brings us together is the belief that everyone in our city should have access to a safe, stable, and affordable home.",120,,
603,0.97,4883.278,4886.781,And land use is the foundation to accomplishing this goal.,120,,
604,0.97,4886.781,4905.8,"We believe it is important to Decouple this designation from the past, so that we can better address our future needs.",120,,
605,0.97,4905.8,4907.535,"First of all, it's inaccurate as used.",120,,
606,0.97,4907.535,4920.682,"I'm not going to go into depth on that, but I think we shouldn't erase these aspects of our city that in the past were important, and continue to be important.",120,,
607,0.97,4920.682,4925.887,This is a path that's been based on harm.,120,,
608,0.97,4925.887,4932.694,By men in struggles of communities of color and affordable living crisis.,120,,
609,0.97,4932.694,4936.131,"There's linking single family zoning around the country, and not just in Seattle.",120,,

614,0.97,4966.928,4969.698,Great to hear you again.,121,,
615,0.97,4969.698,4970.065,There you are.,121,,
616,0.97,4970.065,4970.332,Hello.,122,,
617,0.97,4970.332,4974.703,There you are.,123,,
618,0.97,4974.703,4977.939,"Hi, this is David.",124,,
619,0.97,4977.939,4986.715,I'm calling from the perspective of a multifamily Homeowner in the Interbay magnolia neighborhood of our caring city.,124,,
620,0.97,4986.715,5000.795,"I agree the word family within zone use is considered by some as Exclusivary, as roommates can live together without being a family.",124,,
621,0.97,5000.795,5005.4,There are three distinct loopholes that need dropped.,124,,
622,0.97,5005.4,5013.608,"Either of a multifamily zone and a Townhouse, and I consider my area as a neighborhood.",124,,
623,0.97,5013.608,5019.414,So why does this Council bill exclude multifamily as being part of the neighborhood?,124,,
624,0.97,5019.414,5025.12,"Two, why is the term multifamily not also considered Exclusionary, as single family is.",124,,
625,0.97,5025.12,5031.993,"If there are exclusions to zoning terms, we must be efficient not to offend all.",124,,
626,0.97,5031.993,5042.637,"This oversight may be by learning from Tacoma, who is looking to rename to low Tensity, and middle density.",124,,
627,0.97,5042.637,5043.972,"Lastly, and probably more importantly.",124,,
628,0.97,5043.972,5059.687,"Why are there at least two rural statements regarding expanding housing types and broader range of abuses within this Council bill, which is just a single name change.",124,,
629,0.97,5059.687,5067.429,You're confusing a lot of people with this.,124,,
630,0.97,5067.429,5086.381,We are asking each city council member declare your individual plans for the city in lieu of Seattle residents for whatever they might desire for Seattle residential choices.,124,,
631,0.97,5086.381,5090.752,Ask the residence if low density zones should be eliminated.,124,,
632,0.97,5090.752,5092.72,Thank you very much.,124,,

639,0.97,5118.413,5125.42,This is Suzanne grant talking about Cb120155.,126,,
640,0.97,5125.42,5130.725,Everyone is talk being the extreme importance of trees except Seattle city council.,126,,
641,0.97,5130.725,5135.23,"In this bill, there's a lot of language about allowing develop.",126,,
642,0.97,5135.23,5136.297,In neighborhood residential areas.,126,,
643,0.97,5136.297,5145.14,What is missing is any language that will protect the trees that currently exist in the single family neighborhoods and yards.,126,,
644,0.97,5145.14,5151.746,You all know that 70% of Seattle's canopy is currently in single family neighborhoods.,126,,
645,0.97,5151.746,5165.493,"As Seattle city council enables Spci to allow more structures Toking built without a mandate, the trees will be removed if it makes building easier.",126,,
646,0.97,5165.493,5169.33,More density is possible and desirable.,126,,
647,0.97,5169.33,5180.575,But development needs to be creative be and the responsibility is on city Council to retain what is left of our urban forest.,126,,
648,0.97,5180.575,5185.88,"I disagree that quote, there is no effect from a name change?",126,,
649,0.97,5185.88,5193.054,"A name change can mean a great deal, if it doesn't, why do it?",126,,
650,0.97,5193.054,5198.793,I don't fell we should just accept it.,126,,
651,0.97,5198.793,5205.099,"Please, please, insert appropriate language to save trees, and amend this legislation before passing it, as it is currently written.",126,,
652,0.97,5205.099,5209.737,"If I still have time at the beginning of the meeting, you also promise to steward our land.",126,,

663,0.97,5268.896,5279.474,I'm here today to strongly urge you to vote in favor of amending the comprehensive plan.,128,,
664,0.97,5279.474,5294.155,"While this name change in and of itself won't undo past Harms or Directlily create a more welcoming and inclusive future for housing in Seattle, this creates a key step in what our land use needs.",128,,
665,0.97,5294.155,5302.997,"Civil family zoning, which was implemented in 1923 as a history of racial and economic exclusion through racially restrictive covenants.",128,,
666,0.97,5302.997,5306.034,The effects of those are still felt today.,128,,
667,0.97,5306.034,5313.675,This name change can help facilitate a more balanced and substantial question.,128,,
668,0.97,5313.675,5328.99,"As we consider updating our zoning to better address the challenges we're actively confronting, like racial injustice, economic exclusion and community displacement.",128,,
669,0.97,5328.99,5334.762,"Of the 273 homes we have in our pipeline, more than 65% of them fall within the city of Seattle.",128,,
670,0.97,5334.762,5342.537,That is due in large part to the efforts of the Seattle office of housing.,128,,
671,0.97,5342.537,5351.913,And Thests that you all have made on counsel like this.,128,,
672,0.97,5351.913,5355.383,To allow things like more density.,128,,
673,0.97,5355.383,5358.553,Actually our work in the South Park neighborhood.,128,,

680,0.97,5393.254,5400.228,"Good morning, chair Strauss and members of the land use committee.",130,,
681,0.97,5400.228,5401.629,My name is Vanessa Murdock.,130,,
682,0.97,5401.629,5404.899,I'm offering comment this morning on their behalf.,130,,
683,0.97,5404.899,5417.278,The Commission appreciates the opportunity to support Council bill 120155 to rename the term single family neighborhoods to neighborhood residential neighborhoods.,130,,
684,0.97,5417.278,5429.223,This change will provide the areas with the more accurate title that better reflects the diversity of Householdings living in them.,130,,
685,0.97,5429.223,5433.161,The planning Commission's 2018 neighborhoods for all report advised making this change.,130,,
686,0.97,5433.161,5443.037,"This correction to the zoning term will address what is currently a Mischaracterization of both the housing available in these areas, as well as the people living there.",130,,
687,0.97,5443.037,5454.315,"Indeed the terms single family areas has been a misnomer for many areas, but especially since 1984.",130,,
688,0.97,5454.315,5474.769,"The Commission is supports the term neighborhood residential, as a more accurate description of the housing types currently available in these areas, and hope this name change will help pave the way for encouraging more equitable access, along with parks, schools and services for all.",130,,
689,0.97,5474.769,5489.684,"This name change is a modest, but important step that accurately frames neighborhood residential areas as having a variety of building types with a broad range of household configurations.",130,,
690,0.97,5489.684,5494.021,"The Commission supports this amendment, and thanks Councilmembers for this work.",130,,
691,0.97,5494.021,5494.589,"Thank you, Vanessa.",131,,
692,0.97,5494.589,5502.997,And thank you for your work on the Commission.,131,,
693,0.97,5502.997,5511.939,"Next we have Jay, followed by Bonney Williams.",131,,
694,0.97,5511.939,5513.14,"Hi, I'm Jay Catsenberger.",132,,
695,0.97,5513.14,5518.913,"Regarding the name change, I really.",132,,
696,0.97,5518.913,5522.45,[Applause] really applaud the more inclusive term.,132,,
697,0.97,5522.45,5534.262,"But I want to see that if changes were to happen, it would have to happen in documentation.",132,,
698,0.97,5534.262,5541.469,"The way the document reads now, it is not intented to have a substantive effect.",132,,
699,0.97,5541.469,5549.51,"I think the ordinance should clearly state that it doesn't, like others on the council said just a few moments ago.",132,,
700,0.97,5549.51,5560.521,"I'll point to that next to the last statement, it clearly States that this is a step toward provisions proposed in the comprehensive plan, and that's a substantive change.",132,,
701,0.97,5560.521,5571.966,So I'd like to see that next to the last statement struck.,132,,
702,0.97,5571.966,5581.075,"These AMENDS imply that zoning was put in place for class boundaries, rather than instructor height, scale, and open space.",132,,
703,0.97,5581.075,5599.46,"I would like to Rescale a vote for this name change, if you have to, in order to revise this proposal to include a very clear statement that zoning requirements and provisions does not change.",132,,
704,0.97,5599.46,5607.101,"Because the way it's currently worded, it is not simply a name change, and I think that's wrong.",132,,
705,0.97,5607.101,5616.544,"Also, regardless on what happens on the sports training bill, go stolen.",132,,
706,0.97,5616.544,5620.648,"Thank you, Jay.",133,,
707,0.97,5620.648,5625.219,"Good discussion, up next, we have Judy Benditch.",133,,
708,0.97,5625.219,5628.255,"Good morning, can you hear me.",134,,
709,0.97,5628.255,5628.889,We can.,135,,
710,0.97,5628.889,5631.025,Great to hear your voice.,135,,
711,0.97,5631.025,5640.134,"Thank you Chairperson Strauss and thank you for asking Mr. Lish with him, those questions.",136,,
712,0.97,5640.134,5651.912,"That this is not simply echoing the previous Speaker, that this is simply not intended to, but actually is no change.",136,,
713,0.97,5651.912,5655.049,And I actually appreciated the previous Speaker saying that.,136,,
714,0.97,5655.049,5674.435,"But that's not until, I don't have any qualms about this language, if it indeed is no change, because my neighborhood has always had, one house, on one lot.",136,,
715,0.97,5674.435,5679.707,Has always had mixed use with Multigenerational families.,136,,
716,0.97,5679.707,5681.776,With subdivisions in a part of a house.,136,,
717,0.97,5681.776,5696.724,"We've had, at least 20% of my neighborhood, which incidentally was never a red lined neighborhood has that kind of configuration already.",136,,
718,0.97,5696.724,5707.101,"What bothers me so much, and this is where I really part ways.",136,,
719,0.97,5707.101,5711.205,"That the Council maybe, and I've quoted that in my letters to you.",136,,
720,0.97,5711.205,5727.822,She said I Loo be working on legislation to start the process to appeal the apartment bans by converting the Fsz to residential zone.,136,,
721,0.97,5727.822,5735.463,"She has made her attempt absolutely clear, and that's not the way to do it.",136,,
722,0.97,5735.463,5747.274,"Unless she Repudiates what she said, saying this has no change adopting this language, then I think the whole thing should be shot.",136,,
723,0.97,5747.274,5747.575,Thank you.,136,,
724,0.97,5747.575,5761.555,"I have in my letter what really needs to take place, and that is concrete planning to make sure that E E.Every neighborhood has affordable housing, and I completely agree with Suzanne grant.",136,,
725,0.97,5761.555,5762.857,"Thank you, Judy.",137,,
726,0.97,5762.857,5768.996,"Please, thank you for sending in your letters, and feel free to send in any further comments.",137,,
727,0.97,5768.996,5776.804,"Up next, we have Bonney Williams, followed by Irene wall.",137,,
728,0.97,5776.804,5778.005,And Laura Lowe.,137,,
729,0.97,5778.005,5779.306,"Laura, you're not present.",137,,
730,0.97,5779.306,5780.608,"David wart, also not present.",137,,
731,0.97,5780.608,5797.291,"So I'm going to run through the remainder of the speakers, just so we know where we are.",137,,
732,0.97,5797.291,5801.462,"Ruby, David, Laura, are not present at this time.",137,,
733,0.97,5801.462,5803.264,Please refer to the Email you've received.,137,,
734,0.97,5803.264,5805.299,That is not the call in line.,137,,
735,0.97,5805.299,5808.335,That is not the listen line on the agenda.,137,,
736,0.97,5808.335,5809.136,"Bonney, good morning, you're up.",137,,
737,0.97,5809.136,5813.941,I hope you're having a great day.,137,,
738,0.97,5813.941,5819.046,I see you there.,138,,
739,0.97,5819.046,5822.583,Press Star 6. not pound 6.,138,,
740,0.97,5822.583,5822.883,Hello?,139,,
741,0.97,5822.883,5826.153,"Good morning, we can hear you.",140,,
742,0.97,5826.153,5827.755,Good morning.,141,,
743,0.97,5827.755,5828.589,"Okay, good morning.",141,,
744,0.97,5828.589,5838.132,With all the discussion so far I'm not convinced this is just a technical change.,141,,
745,0.97,5838.132,5852.079,Part of the contradictions that I've been sealing and dealing with is Muss Musqueda's comments.,141,,
746,0.97,5852.079,5853.647,I'm against the passage of Cbo120155.,141,,
747,0.97,5853.647,5859.72,"The name change and the amendments that are included, especially in the land use section.",141,,
748,0.97,5859.72,5869.797,"I think that this should be let emergency the update for the 2024 plan, with a more thorough process.",141,,
749,0.97,5869.797,5890.251,"The people in support of this are primarily developers, the planning Commission, so do mention that in the bill to introduce future Rezones, and new housing types, I think this has not had enough circulation to neighborhoods.",141,,
750,0.97,5890.251,5892.519,I think they've been skipped over.,141,,
751,0.97,5892.519,5904.732,"I would request that residential and commercial zones need clear distinctions in this bill, so therefore remove land use 7.11.",141,,
752,0.97,5904.732,5918.712,Which talks about introducing large scale apartments and giving the Council authority to pass that kind of zoning change.,141,,
753,0.97,5918.712,5920.948,So that language is ambiguous.,141,,
754,0.97,5920.948,5923.083,It's open for interpretation.,141,,
755,0.97,5923.083,5927.454,"It's not clear, it's not transparent.",141,,
756,0.97,5927.454,5935.763,I feel there are top down divisions without extensive outreach.,141,,
757,0.97,5935.763,5944.371,"Also, I want to clarify that in 2019, single family, Uh-Oh, thank you.",141,,
758,0.97,5944.371,5945.272,"Thank you, Bonney.",142,,
759,0.97,5945.272,5948.776,"Appreciate it, and feel free --",142,,
760,0.97,5948.776,5949.443,Thank you.,143,,
761,0.97,5949.443,5952.179,Thank you.,144,,
762,0.97,5952.179,5953.747,Can I make one quick comment?,144,,
763,0.97,5953.747,5956.55,"Yeah, you stopped at ten seconds.",145,,
764,0.97,5956.55,5957.818,"Actually, I have to remain consistent.",145,,
765,0.97,5957.818,5964.358,"If you could Email in, or if you need a chat, we can talk Offline.",145,,
766,0.97,5964.358,5967.761,"All right, thank you, Bye Bye.",146,,
767,0.97,5967.761,5975.836,Up next is Irene wall followed by Laura.,147,,
768,0.97,5975.836,5979.273,You are not present.,147,,
769,0.97,5979.273,5980.708,"We have Irene, Laura, Alicia, Colleen.",147,,
770,0.97,5980.708,5981.241,"Good morning, Irene.",147,,
771,0.97,5981.241,5986.347,Good morning.,148,,
772,0.97,5986.347,5987.414,Can you hear me?,148,,
773,0.97,5987.414,5991.952,We can.,149,,
774,0.97,5991.952,5995.022,My name is Irene wall.,150,,
775,0.97,5995.022,6000.761,If you want to change simply be honest about it.,150,,
776,0.97,6000.761,6003.564,Labeling does nothing but simply create further confusion.,150,,
777,0.97,6003.564,6007.334,Since there is no quote definition of a neighborhood residential zone.,150,,
778,0.97,6007.334,6016.276,And it is not typical to name a zone after historical Nonconforming uses.,150,,
779,0.97,6016.276,6027.855,Why not act on your own budget and evaluate the benefits and impact of allowing more density in single family zones in the Onupdate.,150,,
780,0.97,6027.855,6035.029,"Also the tree plans considered are intimately connected to single family zoning, since most trees are in single family zones.",150,,
781,0.97,6035.029,6044.004,"Changing the land use patterns affecting thousands of property owners requires a transparent process, and solid analysis.",150,,
782,0.97,6044.004,6044.338,Details.,150,,
783,0.97,6044.338,6055.115,"So wait until the update and the accompanying EIS is available, to decide what should be allowed in single family zones and then rename it accordingly.",150,,
784,0.97,6055.115,6066.894,The proposed neighborhood residential label does not distinguish the single family zone uses from our primarily residential zones in the same neighborhoods.,150,,
785,0.97,6066.894,6067.828,This further adds to confusion.,150,,
786,0.97,6067.828,6075.936,Merely Renaming the zone does nothing to reduce the cost of housing in Seattle or reduce the homeless crisis.,150,,
787,0.97,6075.936,6085.779,"The Council should allow the COMP plan process to proceed, and then take the actions to make any zoning changes to accomplish the stated goals.",150,,
788,0.97,6085.779,6094.288,"The zone name will be justified at that point, not now.",150,,
789,0.97,6094.288,6095.122,"Thank you, Irene.",151,,
790,0.97,6095.122,6098.258,"Laura Lowe is next, but not present.",151,,
791,0.97,6098.258,6102.729,"So Laura, if you are listening please do call back in.",151,,
792,0.97,6102.729,6103.864,"Next, we have Alicia Ruiz.",151,,
793,0.97,6103.864,6108.168,"David ward, you are not present, and you would be after Colleen.",151,,
794,0.97,6108.168,6115.943,"If you don't call in, Logan Bauers will follow.",151,,
795,0.97,6115.943,6117.077,"Good morning, Alicia.",151,,
796,0.97,6117.077,6120.38,Good morning.,152,,
797,0.97,6120.38,6138.398,"My name is Alicia Ruiz, I'm here today to express that master builders Association of King County fully support the proposed amendment that just changes the name of the single family zone to a more inclusive name of neighborhood residential zone.",152,,
798,0.97,6138.398,6151.478,It is an important move forward to support more diverse and Exwit table neighborhoods.,152,,
799,0.97,6151.478,6152.446,It also adds to opportunity.,152,,
800,0.97,6152.446,6158.552,"I'm sorry, I'll end it there, but yes, we definitely support this amendment.",152,,
801,0.97,6158.552,6158.852,Thank you.,152,,
802,0.97,6158.852,6161.121,"Thank you, Alicia.",153,,
803,0.97,6161.121,6169.563,"Up next is Colleen Mcclear followed by Logan Bauers, Evan Shaw.",153,,
804,0.97,6169.563,6178.205,Please call in if you would like to testify.,153,,
805,0.97,6178.205,6183.61,"Good morning, Colleen.",153,,
806,0.97,6183.61,6183.877,Colleen?,153,,
807,0.97,6183.877,6190.584,"I see you're there, press Star 6, not pound 6. Star 6.",153,,
808,0.97,6190.584,6192.119,There you are.,153,,
809,0.97,6192.119,6192.719,Off mute.,153,,
810,0.97,6192.719,6194.922,I can hear your voice.,153,,
811,0.97,6194.922,6196.924,Thank you chair Strauss.,154,,
812,0.97,6196.924,6197.658,This is Colleen.,154,,
813,0.97,6197.658,6202.329,I'm representing law office community club.,154,,
814,0.97,6202.329,6203.83,We're talking today about 120155.,154,,
815,0.97,6203.83,6208.035,The name change for a residential is not offensive at all.,154,,
816,0.97,6208.035,6216.21,It's actually very inclusive to reflect as Council has noted in central staff the types of housing diversity that we already have even in our neighborhood.,154,,
817,0.97,6216.21,6222.816,"I know people would be surprised about that, but there's plenty of Duplexes, Adu's, apartments on the edges.",154,,
818,0.97,6222.816,6223.383,It's all fine.,154,,
819,0.97,6223.383,6225.419,It's all part of the neighborhood.,154,,
820,0.97,6225.419,6226.053,So that's a great thing.,154,,
821,0.97,6226.053,6235.762,"Other speakers have mentioned we have to be careful that this legislation does not Embed some unrelated statements, and I think you made it very clear that it was just a clean bill.",154,,
822,0.97,6235.762,6246.907,"Just changing the name, but I think the bill really needs to be scoped through, to be sure that we take out anything that's not related to the name change.",154,,
823,0.97,6246.907,6250.978,"A couple of other things, the goal is to promote more home ownership.",154,,
824,0.97,6250.978,6257.284,That's a great goal for this change of name.,154,,
825,0.97,6257.284,6262.823,"Secondly, the legislation emphasizes the name character neighborhood, especially Lu7.10.",154,,
826,0.97,6262.823,6271.732,"It says reflect the character of the low density development through the scale, and structure and set backs.",154,,
827,0.97,6271.732,6272.566,But who polices that?,154,,
828,0.97,6272.566,6284.911,I think the bigger problem is all those that see it Seattle Department of construction and inspections continually gives the inspections the design view has pretty much made it professionals.,154,,
829,0.97,6284.911,6289.249,"Even if they're granted, there's no way to police that character.",154,,
830,0.97,6289.249,6299.86,"I think in legislation comes to be with this change, we do really need to put mechanisms there for protecting that character and how it's going to be done.",154,,
831,0.97,6299.86,6308.335,"Then Lastly, the tree canopy is, as we all know in this community, mostly embedded into the single family, which is the residential areas.",154,,
832,0.97,6308.335,6319.246,"For the last 20 years, the single family has lost about 10% of their canopy.",154,,
833,0.97,6319.246,6326.82,"Multifamily housing went from 18% to 5%, and that's something we need to Embed with the tree protection.",154,,
834,0.97,6326.82,6330.39,Great to hear from you.,155,,
835,0.97,6330.39,6334.661,"Up next, we have Logan Bauers.",155,,
836,0.97,6334.661,6340.701,"That will complete our list unless David ward, or Ruby Holland does call in.",155,,
837,0.97,6340.701,6341.201,"Logan, good morning.",155,,
838,0.97,6341.201,6342.769,Good morning.,156,,
839,0.97,6342.769,6346.54,Thank you Councilmembers for your time.,156,,
840,0.97,6346.54,6349.543,My name's Logan Bauers.,156,,
841,0.97,6349.543,6352.646,I'm a small business owner.,156,,
842,0.97,6352.646,6367.094,"In district 7. you will hear, you've heard a lot of other public comments supporting this legislation on visibility and equity grounds.",156,,
843,0.97,6367.094,6369.696,I Cosign all of that.,156,,
844,0.97,6369.696,6370.097,Completely agree.,156,,
845,0.97,6370.097,6374.101,We need this legislation and we need more.,156,,
846,0.97,6374.101,6374.835,We need customers.,156,,
847,0.97,6374.835,6375.802,We need more customers.,156,,
848,0.97,6375.802,6379.673,We need customers who can walk to our businesses.,156,,
849,0.97,6379.673,6382.342,We need customers who can bike to our businesses.,156,,
850,0.97,6382.342,6393.553,We also need employees to be able to afford to live Fleer work and not commute an hour from outside of the city.,156,,
851,0.97,6393.553,6401.795,"This ordinance is a smart first step toward supporting us, and placing employees near our business.",156,,
852,0.97,6401.795,6410.07,"If you care about businesses, you will support this ordinance, and housing stock at all income levels.",156,,
853,0.97,6410.07,6414.207,Thank you chair Strauss for all of your hard work on this.,156,,
854,0.97,6414.207,6415.108,"Thank you, Logan.",157,,
855,0.97,6415.108,6417.744,Always nice to hear your voice.,157,,
856,0.97,6417.744,6421.548,Up next is Evan Shaw.,157,,
857,0.97,6421.548,6424.684,"Follow the by Steve, David ward, Robey Holland, you are still not present.",157,,
858,0.97,6424.684,6430.19,So please call in if you'd like to speak.,157,,
859,0.97,6430.19,6431.525,"Good morning, Evan.",157,,
860,0.97,6431.525,6431.825,Hello.,158,,
861,0.97,6431.825,6432.292,This is Evan Shaw.,158,,
862,0.97,6432.292,6435.295,First time I've commented on a meeting like this.,158,,
863,0.97,6435.295,6440.634,"I will say I had to wait a while to get on here, but I appreciate the chance to be able to talk.",158,,
864,0.97,6440.634,6455.315,"I agree with people who have talked about making more human focused neighborhoods in Seattle, getting away from the zoning code that locks us into kind of a suburban style development pattern.",158,,
865,0.97,6455.315,6473.934,"I agree with people who have highlighted the racial history of this specific type of zoning designation, and how changing that name is, you know, a step towards perhaps getting back to a better place there.",158,,
866,0.97,6473.934,6479.072,"Then on climate change, obviously sprawl, commuting, all of that is very bad for that.",158,,
867,0.97,6479.072,6480.74,I appreciate the folks talking about trees.,158,,
868,0.97,6480.74,6494.02,"But for he every tree here that we're protecting, that doesn't help out in the net on the climate change situation, if we're Bulldozing acres to build new suburbs.",158,,
869,0.97,6494.02,6501.127,"I'd love to see the trees protected here, but got to think globally.",158,,
870,0.97,6501.127,6508.068,"All of those reasons, I support the name change.",158,,
871,0.97,6508.068,6510.27,"Thank you, Evan.",159,,
872,0.97,6510.27,6514.407,"Last, and definitely not least, Steve Zemke.",159,,
873,0.97,6514.407,6516.376,"Last call for David, and Ruby.",159,,
874,0.97,6516.376,6525.652,"For those that are not present, please make sure you have received, and are calling in via the Email calling line, not the listen line on the agenda.",159,,
875,0.97,6525.652,6528.255,Take it away Mr. Zemke.,159,,
876,0.97,6528.255,6530.257,Good morning to you.,159,,
877,0.97,6530.257,6535.128,Steve Zemke with tree pack.,160,,
878,0.97,6535.128,6546.339,"A couple of comments, noticing that it doesn't appear in this that you specifically mention the tree protection ordinance which has language of single family in it.",160,,
879,0.97,6546.339,6566.226,"If you're going to not change that, but change other things, I think you really need to look and see if there are other places that you're missing where a single family language is, because that would create great confusion, and it means that Sdci is going to have to change a lot of their memos and other things that relate to single family.",160,,
880,0.97,6566.226,6566.826,Just by changing the name.,160,,
881,0.97,6566.826,6572.065,Because you're going to create a lot of confusion.,160,,
882,0.97,6572.065,6580.173,The other point coming up here is that we're not fooling anybody.,160,,
883,0.97,6580.173,6584.544,What you are doing is looking at more density?,160,,
884,0.97,6584.544,6585.245,In the city.,160,,
885,0.97,6585.245,6586.613,Tree pack is not against that.,160,,
886,0.97,6586.613,6594.154,We support the need for maintaining trees and increasing our tree canopy up to the level that we proposed.,160,,
887,0.97,6594.154,6609.603,"Certainly, a lot of that, but we need a thorough discussion on how do we do that, and part of the problem is, we've gone 12 years now without updating the tree ordinance, looking at things that could be done to protect trees.",160,,
888,0.97,6609.603,6614.507,"In opposition to what the last person said, trees create healthy communities.",160,,
889,0.97,6614.507,6619.846,We live in Seattle.,160,,
890,0.97,6619.846,6621.047,We want to keep Seattle healthy.,160,,
891,0.97,6621.047,6626.786,The urban heat is what happens when you don't have a lot of trees.,160,,
892,0.97,6626.786,6630.49,"And we see that in the South, and we need to protect that.",160,,
893,0.97,6630.49,6644.604,"A poll that came out, you've probably seen that, 70, 80% of the people that were polled, voters that were polled, support stronger tree protection, including things like maximizing the Retension of existing trees throughout the whole development process.",160,,
894,0.97,6644.604,6654.18,"So please keep that in mind in terms of moving forward, we need a thorough discussion of all of our options of housing in the city and how we can maximize trees at the same time.",160,,
895,0.97,6654.18,6655.982,Thank you.,160,,
896,0.97,6655.982,6665.792,Thank you.,161,,
897,0.97,6665.792,6669.396,Always great to hear from you Steve.,161,,
898,0.97,6669.396,6671.731,"I.T., you can confirm they're not present?",161,,
899,0.97,6671.731,6678.204,There are no more public hearing registrants.,162,,
900,0.97,6678.204,6678.571,Excellent.,163,,
901,0.97,6678.571,6678.872,Thank you.,163,,
902,0.97,6678.872,6683.943,That was our last Speaker remotely present to speak at this public hearing.,163,,
903,0.97,6683.943,6686.68,The public hearing on counsel bill 120155 is now closed.,163,,
904,0.97,6686.68,6688.648,Thank you to everyone who provided comment today.,163,,
905,0.97,6688.648,6694.087,This legislation will be back before the Committee on Friday afternoon for a possible vote.,163,,
906,0.97,6694.087,6706.199,Wanting to alert everyone that was the third of five items.,163,,
907,0.97,6706.199,6707.567,We're moving into item four.,163,,
908,0.97,6707.567,6708.668,The Belltown small lot.,163,,
909,0.97,6708.668,6722.749,"If my colleagues are comfortable, after the public hearing, I would like to suspend the rules to have a vote on the same day as the legislation received a public hearing, because we've had this legislation in our committee before us before.",163,,
910,0.97,6722.749,6736.996,"So our next item of business is a briefing on counsel bill 120153, Mr. OM, would you please read the abbreviated title into record.",163,,
911,0.97,6736.996,6743.436,An ordinance relating to land use in zoning.,164,,
912,0.97,6743.436,6754.18,Addinga new section to provide alternative development standards for small lots located in downtown mixed residential zones.,164,,
913,0.97,6754.18,6755.014,Thank you.,165,,
914,0.97,6755.014,6758.752,We received a briefing on our August 11th Deeding.,165,,
915,0.97,6758.752,6764.09,We're joined today by the amazing Brennon Staley.,165,,
916,0.97,6764.09,6767.193,"Once again, Lish Whitson of our Council central is staff.",165,,
917,0.97,6767.193,6781.641,"Before you begin, just a reminder, I'm going to be asking for a vote after the public hearing just as a remainder.",165,,
918,0.97,6781.641,6785.145,"Brennon, Lish, can you provide us a brief overview.",165,,
919,0.97,6785.145,6790.049,"Yes, I'm going to have a Powerpoint.",166,,
920,0.97,6790.049,6795.421,Should be coming up now.,166,,
921,0.97,6795.421,6806.199,"This legislation called small lot development in Belltown, sorry, it's not going to full screen for some reason.",166,,
922,0.97,6806.199,6809.569,Sorry . There we go.,166,,
923,0.97,6809.569,6812.438,There we are.,167,,
924,0.97,6812.438,6837.063,So the purpose of this legislation is for more appropriate development standards for small lots in limited areas of Belltown in order to create more additional housing and also to support innovative types of construction that can help to bring down costs and meet environmental goals.,168,,
925,0.97,6837.063,6846.239,The challenge right now is it is difficult to build on small towns on the North side.,168,,
926,0.97,6846.239,6846.773,That's for two reasons.,168,,
927,0.97,6846.773,6852.478,The height limit of 145 feet already requires steel construction.,168,,
928,0.97,6852.478,6857.45,"Anytime you go over 85 feet, that's already the case.",168,,
929,0.97,6857.45,6858.785,So it's already difficult.,168,,
930,0.97,6858.785,6863.923,We have development that requires building shapes that make that even more impractical.,168,,
931,0.97,6863.923,6880.74,"At the same time, there's a new opportunity that has presented itself allowing it to become more easier to build on these kind of difficult sites that go up to 145 feet.",168,,
932,0.97,6880.74,6893.92,"But at the same time, they require a stacking of units and so that development standard in particular makes them very challenging to use on these sites.",168,,
933,0.97,6893.92,6899.359,"So the proposal is, would allow to the Dmr zones in Belltown that have a highlight limit of 145 feet.",168,,
934,0.97,6899.359,6907.467,"You can see on the map on the right, it's those areas shaded in gray.",168,,
935,0.97,6907.467,6908.167,It is 33 blocks.,168,,
936,0.97,6908.167,6917.744,"Additionally, those sites would have to be less than 14,500 square feet and the building on them would have to be at least 75% residential.",168,,
937,0.97,6917.744,6933.593,"So also on that map we've shown in yellow and blue the sites that where this, that meet that size threshold, and could potentially have this applied to it.",168,,
938,0.97,6933.593,6939.265,"The others are single lots, and the blue ones are double that size.",168,,
939,0.97,6939.265,6944.47,"In terms of what exists on this, there is no housing on any of these sites today.",168,,
940,0.97,6944.47,6950.043,So we don't expect there would be any displacement risk.,168,,
941,0.97,6950.043,6956.349,"Of these 24 sites that are highlighted, there is one that's under development right now.",168,,
942,0.97,6956.349,6958.017,That's the 303 battery site.,168,,
943,0.97,6958.017,6968.728,"Six of them are parking lots, and the remainder are hotel uses, almost all are one story, but some are two stories.",168,,
944,0.97,6968.728,6978.304,The actual change for proposing on those sites is simply allowing housing development to have a slightly different shape.,168,,
945,0.97,6978.304,6981.174,That would be accomplished by two things.,168,,
946,0.97,6981.174,6998.725,"One, there are two different points at which set backs kick in, which cause kind of a stair step.",168,,
947,0.97,6998.725,7001.294,We're SIMPLIFYING that down to one.,168,,
948,0.97,7001.294,7004.864,Then we're requiring them to be lower.,168,,
949,0.97,7004.864,7007.7,That would simply be set back closer to the street.,168,,
950,0.97,7007.7,7010.436,I would highlight this would not increase the size of these buildings.,168,,
951,0.97,7010.436,7026.786,"It does not change the amount of total floor area, or the maximum height of these Buildingsment the idea again is really to have a different shape that would make it much easier for any type of construction, but especially for innovative construction.",168,,
952,0.97,7026.786,7037.797,"Again, this is a shape that is much more consistent, the existing regulations really are unique to Belltown.",168,,
953,0.97,7037.797,7039.632,We don't see that anywhere else.,168,,
954,0.97,7039.632,7045.571,"So again, this change would apply to any kind of construction.",168,,
955,0.97,7045.571,7054.881,"We think it would be helpful to basically any kind of construction, but especially innovative approaches that need that more simpler shape to allow stacking of units.",168,,
956,0.97,7054.881,7059.986,"Again, property owners could continue to develop under the existing code that they have today.",168,,
957,0.97,7059.986,7063.99,So it would not affect anybody who already is planning to take advantage of what we see today.,168,,
958,0.97,7063.99,7068.361,So on the right we just have an example of what this looks like.,168,,
959,0.97,7068.361,7069.796,The left are the existing rules.,168,,
960,0.97,7069.796,7072.532,And the right is the proposed rules.,168,,
961,0.97,7072.532,7079.205,"This is probably the most extreme example of a change you might see, it's on sites that are on the North side of the green streets.",168,,
962,0.97,7079.205,7081.407,We had a green Street set back.,168,,
963,0.97,7081.407,7086.679,And you can see how it simply takes two stair steps and turns into one.,168,,
964,0.97,7086.679,7094.854,"Then reduces the height of that set back so it has, you see it's more impact when you see from the street.",168,,
965,0.97,7094.854,7097.723,But the shape is a lot simpler.,168,,
966,0.97,7097.723,7107.633,I also have one example which is a most more common one for the lots that are not on a green Street or are on the South side of green street.,168,,
967,0.97,7107.633,7113.039,You can see today projects are already allowed to build kind of as a wall on the street.,168,,
968,0.97,7113.039,7113.539,That wouldn't change.,168,,
969,0.97,7113.539,7117.877,And so for these lots you probably would not notice very much from the street.,168,,
970,0.97,7117.877,7122.482,The big change would be that the kind of the interior light well.,168,,
971,0.97,7122.482,7132.358,"So under this proposal, the light well would be a little smaller, but it would go down farther to the bottom units as well.",168,,
972,0.97,7132.358,7139.765,"So for most sites, again this is entertained to encourage housing.",168,,
973,0.97,7139.765,7143.369,We might get housing we wouldn't get otherwise.,168,,
974,0.97,7143.369,7148.14,"The proposed rules on most sites, it wouldn't make much difference from the street.",168,,
975,0.97,7148.14,7155.515,"But rather, you know, kind of impact that light well.",168,,
976,0.97,7155.515,7160.453,So that's my presentation.,168,,
977,0.97,7160.453,7161.02,Wonderful last slide.,169,,
978,0.97,7161.02,7162.054,Thank you.,169,,
979,0.97,7162.054,7163.89,I love it.,169,,
980,0.97,7163.89,7164.757,I do have two questions.,169,,
981,0.97,7164.757,7174.167,"Just generally, and I know you mentioned this, I'm just trying to raise the type, does this increase the development capacity of these sites in Belltown?",169,,
982,0.97,7174.167,7174.634,It does not.,170,,
983,0.97,7174.634,7181.507,It does not change the floor area or the maximum height.,170,,
984,0.97,7181.507,7181.874,Great.,171,,
985,0.97,7181.874,7183.843,And so development capacity remains the same.,171,,
986,0.97,7183.843,7193.419,My office has also heard from some property owners in Belltown interested to apply for more properties.,171,,
987,0.97,7193.419,7196.889,Can you share why this is just limited to the small lots?,171,,
988,0.97,7196.889,7206.632,"This is really focused on the small lots, because there's where housing production is the most difficult on the single lots.",172,,
989,0.97,7206.632,7215.975,We haven't seen any projects able to develop up to that 145 feet on a single lot.,172,,
990,0.97,7215.975,7220.046,"We've seen only one in recent history, a double lot.",172,,
991,0.97,7220.046,7226.786,These are where our development standards are making it really difficult for projects to develop.,172,,
992,0.97,7226.786,7235.127,"On larger lots, we're seeing it's easier for them to happen with the underground parking.",172,,
993,0.97,7235.127,7241.267,We're focusing where the development standards are really preventing housing development.,172,,
994,0.97,7241.267,7242.101,"Wonderful, thank you, Brennon.",173,,
995,0.97,7242.101,7244.604,"Colleagues, do you have any questions before we move into public hearing?",173,,
996,0.97,7244.604,7256.415,I know this is the second time we've had this bill before us.,173,,
997,0.97,7256.415,7257.016,Councilmember Lewis.,173,,
998,0.97,7257.016,7258.718,"Yes, thank you Councilmember Strauss.",174,,
999,0.97,7258.718,7272.698,So am I counting correctly on the map on slide 5 that this would only impact about 24 lots at it's presently constituted in the area where it would be in effect?,174,,
1000,0.97,7272.698,7274.0,That's right.,175,,
1001,0.97,7274.0,7288.714,"Obviously lots could in the future be Subdivided, but as they exist today, we found 24 lots that meet the size criteria.",175,,
1002,0.97,7288.714,7288.981,Right.,176,,
1003,0.97,7288.981,7299.692,I have a couple additional questions based on some neighborhood concerns that I've heard from residents.,176,,
1004,0.97,7299.692,7325.251,Regarding the potential impact that the difference in shape permitted under this ordinance would allow to make this small lot development feasible in terms of concerns about the difference between modular and paneled buildings and traditional concrete and steel buildings.,176,,
1005,0.97,7325.251,7335.261,"To maintain view corridors or access to light, potentially if the buildings are sort of Bulkier.",176,,
1006,0.97,7335.261,7338.23,How would you address the potential concerns?,176,,
1007,0.97,7338.23,7344.036,We've just had a good conversation about how floor area ratio and height is going to remain consistent.,176,,
1008,0.97,7344.036,7352.311,So I think these are really potential concerns coming from residents regarding the potential change in shape.,176,,
1009,0.97,7352.311,7369.061,I'm just curious if there's analysis on whether there could be sort of concerns about building lighting or the corridor where the shape makes a meaningful difference in that being an issue?,176,,
1010,0.97,7369.061,7369.328,Yeah.,177,,
1011,0.97,7369.328,7385.978,"So I guess, first, just to clarify in terms of the type of construction, we don't expect that there would be a difference between, you know steel and concrete construction versus Panellized or Modularized construction in terms of how they would like.",177,,
1012,0.97,7385.978,7390.616,They would tend to have the same form.,177,,
1013,0.97,7390.616,7397.256,"And you know, in terms of the, obviously one of the Intents here is to make it easier to build housing.",177,,
1014,0.97,7397.256,7403.596,It is possible we might see housing on live lots where we might not otherwise see it.,177,,
1015,0.97,7403.596,7413.205,"But in terms of the shape itself, on most lots, you're already allowed to build kind of to the street lot line.",177,,
1016,0.97,7413.205,7416.008,"So on most lots, probably the shape wouldn't change that much.",177,,
1017,0.97,7416.008,7427.453,"This is again, an example, if there's no green street, it is possible there could be small changes in terms of how close they get to the alley.",177,,
1018,0.97,7427.453,7437.463,But in general developers tend to want to have windows and Reserve things for the light well.,177,,
1019,0.97,7437.463,7441.767,So on most lots you probably won't see a lot of shape differences from the street.,177,,
1020,0.97,7441.767,7451.844,"But then obviously on green streets we are proposing to change the green Street set back, so that it is, you know, it starts lower to the street, but it's more consistent.",177,,
1021,0.97,7451.844,7457.817,"Again, but we are only allowing that on the North side of the green streets.",177,,
1022,0.97,7457.817,7462.087,There definitely would be a visual impact for sure.,177,,
1023,0.97,7462.087,7471.964,But it shouldn't have an impact on the amount of light that gets down to those green streets.,177,,
1024,0.97,7471.964,7475.0,"So I think, so overall, there definitely would be small changes.",177,,
1025,0.97,7475.0,7498.357,"I think as we talk to people about these changes, they would be a little bit wider at the top, which might make them a little Bulkier, but it would feel like the building is pushed back from the street, if you're walking on a sidewalk, for example.",177,,
1026,0.97,7498.357,7499.992,So there are small differences.,177,,
1027,0.97,7499.992,7508.501,But overall they don't seem to be very large visual districts distinctions.,177,,
1028,0.97,7508.501,7517.276,"And really were designed to not have much impact on light in the street, because that's something very important to these neighborhoods.",177,,
1029,0.97,7517.276,7530.856,"On the view corridor issue, the legislation does not neat the set back requirements.",178,,
1030,0.97,7530.856,7536.362,Thank you for confirming that.,179,,
1031,0.97,7536.362,7542.935,"So pivoting to, to the conversation on the impact.",179,,
1032,0.97,7542.935,7569.528,"You anticipate that this change and the possibility that these 24 lots will be able to benefit from modular construction, which could in turn create more demand for materials like timber or building practices that we know are more environmentally conscious and less Co2 intensive.",179,,
1033,0.97,7569.528,7577.636,"Do we see Incentivizing the development on the lots situated here, and how we might be making that more viable.",179,,
1034,0.97,7577.636,7580.873,Do you care to comment on that at all?,179,,
1035,0.97,7580.873,7591.483,"Yeah, so obviously one of the Intents of this legislation is to try and make it easier for innovative construction approaches to be used.",180,,
1036,0.97,7591.483,7596.388,"Obviously, we're not trying to kind of prefer them over other types.",180,,
1037,0.97,7596.388,7606.565,"This would help basically anyone who wants to develop through any kind of approach, but we do want to make it feasible, so people with start piloting, and testing those.",180,,
1038,0.97,7606.565,7630.322,"We do know that from past camps and current building practices that it does Panellize, it does tent to use less materials, because it's done in a factory where they can, they don't have the same kind of waste when they build on site.",180,,
1039,0.97,7630.322,7642.968,"A lot of these sustainable living innovations, Tiley has water Reuse systems, and integrated solar into it, so it can create possibilities for new types of construction there as well.",180,,
1040,0.97,7642.968,7650.409,"Cross laminated timber is something we're not yet seeing much, but we've recently amended the building code to make it much easier.",180,,
1041,0.97,7650.409,7656.882,We're hopeful over the coming years that it could be a practice that would be really useful.,180,,
1042,0.97,7656.882,7660.486,We're hoping it would encourage that as well.,180,,
1043,0.97,7660.486,7665.224,"In terms of my environmental analysis, we didn't try to quantify that.",180,,
1044,0.97,7665.224,7669.294,"There's a lot of what IFS, and different types of companies doing this work.",180,,
1045,0.97,7669.294,7686.011,"But one of the purposes of this is to kind of make that type of construction possible, because it does have a number of environmental benefits as well as potentially holding the possibility of helping to reduce the cost of the construction in the long term.",180,,
1046,0.97,7686.011,7690.816,Thank you.,181,,
1047,0.97,7690.816,7696.422,I don't have any additional questions.,181,,
1048,0.97,7696.422,7698.424,"Excellent, those are good questions.",182,,
1049,0.97,7698.424,7699.425,Other Councilmembers seeing no questions.,182,,
1050,0.97,7699.425,7706.598,"We'll open the remote public hearing, and then we'll take some votes on suspending the rules if you're comfortable.",182,,
1051,0.97,7706.598,7712.704,"Then a vote on the legislation, if you're comfortable.",182,,
1052,0.97,7712.704,7725.717,"So before we open the remote public hearing, I would ask that everyone please be patient as we continue to learn how to operate this system and navigate through the inevitable growing pains.",182,,
1053,0.97,7725.717,7730.823,We're adding new features that allow for additional public participation.,182,,
1054,0.97,7730.823,7732.558,Each Speaker will be given two minutes to speak.,182,,
1055,0.97,7732.558,7739.765,"I will call on one Speaker at a time, and in the order in which you registered on the Council's Website.",182,,
1056,0.97,7739.765,7752.077,"If you've not yet registered nd would like to speak, you can go to the Seattle Website at Seattle.Gov/Council.",182,,

1059,0.97,7772.965,7777.736,"This is just on 120153, the small lot, Belltown small lots.",182,,
1060,0.97,7777.736,7780.873,Speakers will hear a Chime when ten seconds are left of your allotted time.,182,,
1061,0.97,7780.873,7785.711,I will thank you as your time concludes.,182,,
1062,0.97,7785.711,7792.117,"Once you hear the claim, those ten seconds are left, please wrap up your comments.",182,,
1063,0.97,7792.117,7797.656,The Speaker's microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next Speaker.,182,,
1064,0.97,7797.656,7809.067,"We ask you please Disconnect from the line, and if you plan on following this meeting, please join us on the agenda.",182,,
1065,0.97,7809.067,7821.78,We will begin with the first Speaker on the list.,182,,
1066,0.97,7821.78,7823.182,We have seven speakers listed.,182,,
1067,0.97,7823.182,7829.788,"Tom Eens, Ken Phillips, and Allen Klein, you are not present, so please refer to the Email you received, and call in now.",182,,
1068,0.97,7829.788,7837.362,"If you are on the listen line, you are in the wrong place.",182,,
1069,0.97,7837.362,7844.837,"So I'll run down the list, so everyone knows where we are.",182,,
1070,0.97,7844.837,7846.171,"Howard Anderson, Tom Eens.",182,,
1071,0.97,7846.171,7846.939,Jimmy blaze.,182,,

1074,0.97,7850.742,7851.743,How are you today?,182,,
1075,0.97,7851.743,7853.579,Hi.,183,,

1080,0.97,7859.785,7864.456,"Yes, I want to talk about Cb120153.",185,,
1081,0.97,7864.456,7871.763,This bill will increase the width of Belltown small lot buildings and reduce the requirements for their upper level set backs.,185,,
1082,0.97,7871.763,7885.777,Building with set backs are elements put in the code specifically to protect adjacent buildings and the street.,185,,
1083,0.97,7885.777,7890.649,As written this Expedites modular property.,185,,
1084,0.97,7890.649,7894.953,It's a Tradeoff we don't need to make.,185,,
1085,0.97,7894.953,7898.09,We need to consider the buildings for generations.,185,,
1086,0.97,7898.09,7901.927,They should be constructed to leave a lasting impact.,185,,
1087,0.97,7901.927,7904.429,People need lights and air.,185,,
1088,0.97,7904.429,7908.4,They make urban villages and neighborhoods livable and equitable.,185,,
1089,0.97,7908.4,7915.44,It's a mistake to think we can't preserve both public health and the environment.,185,,
1090,0.97,7915.44,7930.088,"There's a sustainable architect in Belltown named Tom Eens, I hope he speaks today to provide for modular construction while maintaining adequate nights in neighborhood buildings and streets.",185,,
1091,0.97,7930.088,7937.262,We really can and should do both.,185,,
1092,0.97,7937.262,7942.401,Please don't vote on this bill today and break protocol.,185,,
1093,0.97,7942.401,7950.242,"Please take time, discuss his amendments, and hopefully adopt them.",185,,
1094,0.97,7950.242,7950.776,Thank you.,185,,

1127,0.97,8102.627,8109.801,I'm the chairman of the Denny Triangle neighborhood Association.,189,,
1128,0.97,8109.801,8111.002,Very involved.,189,,
1129,0.97,8111.002,8114.105,Belltown is a special residential gym.,189,,
1130,0.97,8114.105,8125.75,"However, it has been the 145 zone heights have been very restrictive because the current zoning that's in place.",189,,
1131,0.97,8125.75,8136.895,Brendan's outline overview is a clear picture of what this new zoning opens up.,189,,
1132,0.97,8136.895,8145.77,"And with the eight owners and Brian's Architectial firm the last few years, we have been communicating.",189,,
1133,0.97,8145.77,8162.154,"We find that the solutions are based on real effectiveness, getting us a good housing base cost wise and for layout.",189,,
1134,0.97,8162.154,8165.824,Better Layouts and without Impacting the environment.,189,,
1135,0.97,8165.824,8172.597,"The zoning that we're working with is applying now to small lots that's 14,500 or less.",189,,
1136,0.97,8172.597,8172.998,That's two lots.,189,,
1137,0.97,8172.998,8176.735,There can be some traditional work in a two lot.,189,,
1138,0.97,8176.735,8181.64,"The one problem that our group has, there's eight of our owners.",189,,
1139,0.97,8181.64,8190.215,"They're seeing a couple, three of them have the opportunity to end up with three lots, or four lots.",189,,
1140,0.97,8190.215,8192.851,And that current zoning will not benefit them.,189,,
1141,0.97,8192.851,8204.429,"However, if they broke up those properties and do two separate developments, they could then have use this new zoning.",189,,
1142,0.97,8204.429,8206.798,We think that there needs to be further study.,189,,
1143,0.97,8206.798,8209.734,We want to endorse this as it is.,189,,
1144,0.97,8209.734,8212.571,Brennon's group has done a terrific job.,189,,

1155,0.97,8232.49,8233.558,Good morning.,191,,
1156,0.97,8233.558,8236.127,My name is Tom Eens.,191,,
1157,0.97,8236.127,8237.162,I'm addressing Council bill 120153.,191,,
1158,0.97,8237.162,8243.235,I want to make it clear I'm not opposed to this bill.,191,,
1159,0.97,8243.235,8254.746,The alternate lot coverages that are allowed here are not a huge change and allow rational design whether the building is modular or conventional.,191,,
1160,0.97,8254.746,8260.885,I've sent you seven pages in comments about this legislation.,191,,
1161,0.97,8260.885,8270.095,The goals are to make this legislation succeed better in its goals and maintain the openness of our green streets.,191,,
1162,0.97,8270.095,8274.265,The green streets are critical to the character and Liveability of our neighborhood.,191,,
1163,0.97,8274.265,8283.608,"The change that's proposed here goes in the right direction, but it does not go far enough.",191,,
1164,0.97,8283.608,8288.78,The green Street set back is widely misunderstand in this state.,191,,
1165,0.97,8288.78,8296.421,"But basically, not about the the shadows that are cast by tall buildings.",191,,
1166,0.97,8296.421,8301.192,It's about the openness of the street space and the open sky.,191,,
1167,0.97,8301.192,8306.031,The 10-foot uniform set back proposed here will actually impair light to the street.,191,,
1168,0.97,8306.031,8314.205,I have demonstrated that conclusively in the graphic analysis that I submitted on Monday.,191,,
1169,0.97,8314.205,8320.345,This can be fixed by changing that uniform set back to 14 feet.,191,,
1170,0.97,8320.345,8326.418,That will preserve the openness of the street space to the sky.,191,,
1171,0.97,8326.418,8327.318,It will not impair lights.,191,,
1172,0.97,8327.318,8335.193,"More importantly, it will work on both sides of the street, which the proposed 10 feet set back will not.",191,,
1173,0.97,8335.193,8339.531,So I have additional comments in writing.,191,,
1174,0.97,8339.531,8347.539,I can't go into them today about the role of the design and regular Lating the standards of this legislation.,191,,
1175,0.97,8347.539,8349.808,So please do not vote on this proposal today.,191,,
1176,0.97,8349.808,8360.985,"I urge committee and staff to take the time to address the issues raised in my written comments and improve this legislation, and I thank you for your time.",191,,
1177,0.97,8360.985,8362.821,"Thank you, Tom.",192,,
1178,0.97,8362.821,8364.289,Up next we have Jimmy.,192,,
1179,0.97,8364.289,8366.958,And then Ken and Allen are still not present.,192,,
1180,0.97,8366.958,8370.328,"So gentlemen, if you'd like to speak please do now.",192,,
1181,0.97,8370.328,8371.096,"Jimmy, take it away.",192,,
1182,0.97,8371.096,8373.631,"Good morning, and thank you.",193,,
1183,0.97,8373.631,8375.734,My name is Jimmy blaze.,193,,
1184,0.97,8375.734,8379.404,We own a number of lots in the Belltown neighborhood.,193,,
1185,0.97,8379.404,8383.174,I'd like to express my support for the proposed ordinance.,193,,
1186,0.97,8383.174,8388.58,The current code makes building on small lots incredibly challenging.,193,,
1187,0.97,8388.58,8405.797,"The code calls for a layered cake type design, where building must continuously be set back the higher it goes.",193,,
1188,0.97,8405.797,8408.333,This creates architect Tech Ially Unappealing buildings.,193,,
1189,0.97,8408.333,8410.368,I'd like to request one amendment.,193,,
1190,0.97,8410.368,8421.212,"The last sentence within section B States if the Struckture is located on the Southern side of the green street, the sub standards still apply.",193,,
1191,0.97,8421.212,8431.623,This sentence would require parcel to budding the Southern side of a green street to still apply with the overly complex requirements that this ordinance is proposing to change.,193,,
1192,0.97,8431.623,8440.265,Building design and construction challenges do not vary based on the side of the street that the parcel is located on.,193,,
1193,0.97,8440.265,8453.211,The changes in light transmittal that the code amendment here is trying to give back to are minimal between the different building designs allowed between the old code and the proposed ordinance.,193,,
1194,0.97,8453.211,8459.284,"Meanwhile, the changes are incredibly impact on the economic viability of future projects.",193,,
1195,0.97,8459.284,8463.855,I respectfully request that this sentence be removed from the ordinance.,193,,
1196,0.97,8463.855,8468.56,All parcels within the Belltown neighborhood be built within the same standards.,193,,
1197,0.97,8468.56,8474.766,I look forward to this ordinance moving forward today with the requested amendment.,193,,
1198,0.97,8474.766,8475.233,Thank you.,194,,
1199,0.97,8475.233,8475.9,"Thank you, Jimmy.",195,,
1200,0.97,8475.9,8489.814,"I.T., I'm confirming with you at this time that there are no further registrants for this public hearing present for us as Ken and Allen are not present, is that correct?",195,,
1201,0.97,8489.814,8498.623,There are no more public hearing registrants for Cb120153.,196,,
1202,0.97,8498.623,8502.694,"Thank you, that our our last Speaker present to speak on this hearing.",197,,

1205,0.97,8511.202,8522.413,"Colleagues because this is the second meeting we have been briefed on, I would like to consider suspending the rules to vote on the legislation today as seeing as this is again the second meeting.",197,,
1206,0.97,8522.413,8527.285,"With more than a month, about six months in between those two meetings.",197,,
1207,0.97,8527.285,8543.368,"We've had a long agenda planned for Friday afternoon which is why I would prefer to vote it out today, rather than on Friday, like the rest of the bills, because the rest of the bills, this is their first time in committee.",197,,
1208,0.97,8543.368,8551.576,"Colleagues, any feedback on your comfort levels suspending the rules and moving forward.",197,,

1229,0.97,8598.756,8604.329,I know we have had a quite expensive briefing of information on it.,211,,
1230,0.97,8604.329,8605.063,I'm not seeing any.,211,,

1246,0.97,8658.983,8667.992,"Mr. OM, will you please read the abbreviated bill into record.",222,,
1247,0.97,8667.992,8672.363,Facilitate the transfer of developmental rights from Pierce to Snohomish counties to Seattle.,223,,
1248,0.97,8672.363,8679.871,Mr. Freeman will you walk us through this legislation?,224,,
1249,0.97,8679.871,8681.305,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",225,,
1250,0.97,8681.305,8685.61,I briefly remind about the legislative history here.,225,,
1251,0.97,8685.61,8690.815,"Talking about what 120181 would do, and briefly describe the next steps.",225,,
1252,0.97,8690.815,8708.833,"So a little bit on the legislative history, back in 2007, the state authorized a regional Tdr program for central Puget sound that authorizing statute in 343362.",225,,
1253,0.97,8708.833,8716.34,"In 2013, the city and King County took advantage of that authorization.",225,,
1254,0.97,8716.34,8717.475,Passed three ordinances.,225,,
1255,0.97,8717.475,8740.598,"An ordinance that established a local infrastructure project area, and authorized the Mayor at the time to execute a local agreement with King County, and that also includes something sort of a Tif like tax like component for South Lake Union in downtown.",225,,
1256,0.97,8740.598,8760.284,An ordinance that accepted an allegation of transfer and development rights from King County adopted an infrastructure plan primarily for transportation infrastructure in South Lake Union and an ordinance that amended the land use program.,225,,
1257,0.97,8760.284,8773.798,"I bring those up both to remind you of the legislative history, but also to get to the purpose of the bill, which would avoid some of these complicating implementation steps.",225,,
1258,0.97,8773.798,8789.38,"Collectively, those ordinance established a Tdr program with King County, and that program allows development and receiving areas in South Lake Union, downtown, to achieve a bonus floor area to the purpose of developmental rights.",225,,
1259,0.97,8789.38,8802.76,"The King County program has been pretty successful today, and is preserved approximately on 1,500 acres of farmland, and about 90,000 acres of forest land.",225,,
1260,0.97,8802.76,8815.64,"The tax increment financing program of the city which participates in, which goes to the city the county's property tax, will generate about $4 million this year for transportation improvements.",225,,
1261,0.97,8815.64,8819.177,So that's the legislative history and background.,225,,
1262,0.97,8819.177,8821.112,What would Council bill 120181 do?,225,,
1263,0.97,8821.112,8855.646,"It's very simple, it would amendment the land use code to adopt by reference, adoption by reference obvious Obciates from rural, Pierce, and Snohomish counties without adoption of the WAC, would we need local agreements with both Pierce and Snohomish counties.",225,,
1264,0.97,8855.646,8859.15,So what does the WAC require?,225,,
1265,0.97,8859.15,8863.988,Cities and towns participating in the regional program.,225,,
1266,0.97,8863.988,8874.332,"Minimal requirements from the counties, and join requirements.",225,,
1267,0.97,8874.332,8880.638,Those are largely for determining how developmental rights participate in jurisdictions.,225,,
1268,0.97,8880.638,8893.15,My understanding is this legislation is not self executing.,225,,
1269,0.97,8893.15,8897.989,Maybe some corresponding changes to regulations that are to happen in both of those counties as well.,225,,
1270,0.97,8897.989,8906.931,Today there's a public hearing on the bill and a possible vote is scheduled for this coming Friday.,225,,
1271,0.97,8906.931,8907.398,"Thank you, Ketil.",226,,
1272,0.97,8907.398,8910.101,Very helpful.,226,,
1273,0.97,8910.101,8917.074,Just to kind of summarize and lift up some of the things that have been said.,226,,
1274,0.97,8917.074,8927.051,"This is a program that already consists in King County, this would expand it to Snohomish and Pierce counties.",226,,
1275,0.97,8927.051,8930.154,Those development put in downtown Seattle.,226,,
1276,0.97,8930.154,8933.09,So that means we get more density?,226,,
1277,0.97,8933.09,8940.965,"In the city and protect farm and woodland in the suburbs, or in the rural areas.",226,,
1278,0.97,8940.965,8954.011,"For those of you who remember before Issaquah was developed and you would like East from Seattle, there would be an unabated view straight to the trees and into the mountains with no development.",226,,
1279,0.97,8954.011,8957.181,Today we look East and see the suburbs before the mountains.,226,,
1280,0.97,8957.181,8969.927,"The same thing when we are either on our way up highway 2, or on our way to Mount Rainier through Pierce and Snohomish counties.",226,,
1281,0.97,8969.927,8982.74,"If we'd like to retain our unabated views of Mount Rainier and the North cascades as trees as we see today, this is a bill that would do that.",226,,
1282,0.97,8982.74,8986.143,"With no further Ado, colleagues any questions?",226,,
1283,0.97,8986.143,8998.089,"Seeing no questions, we're going to move on, I guess I do have one, two questions questions Ketil.",226,,
1284,0.97,8998.089,9000.391,Can you remind us of the neighborhoods?,226,,
