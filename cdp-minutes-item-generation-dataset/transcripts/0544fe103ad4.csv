23,0.97,159.959,160.126,,4,,
24,0.97,160.126,164.864,"Agenda item number one, council bill 120120 an ordinance for records.",5,,
25,0.97,164.864,173.773,Returning position to the civil service system and then section 4.1300 of the Seattle municipal code for briefing discussion and possible vote.,5,,
26,0.97,173.773,174.073,Great.,6,,
27,0.97,174.073,186.653,"So before I hand to it central staff to give us a substantive presentation on this particular bill, I do want to make some Contextual comments regarding the legislative in tent.",6,,
28,0.97,186.653,198.498,This Council bill would give civil service status to five public officers that currently process the public records request of all elected officials within the city of Seattle.,6,,
29,0.97,198.498,201.401,Including the Mayor's office.,6,,
30,0.97,201.401,206.072,The legislative Department and the city attorney's office.,6,,
31,0.97,206.072,218.551,This legislation was on Monday's Council briefing developed in partnership with the city with the elections Commission and technology Department and with public disclosure officers themselves.,6,,
32,0.97,218.551,226.326,It is intended to insure city of Seattle employees are shielded while carrying out to their Dutys on public records request.,6,,
33,0.97,226.326,239.839,I continue to believe this legislation is an important step for protecting the effectiveness of our public disclosure request when it its directed at an elected official.,6,,
34,0.97,239.839,253.052,We will be taking following steps to improve the record process and this legislation is a single first step of that broader effort.,6,,
35,0.97,253.052,265.231,So with that big said I will hand to it our Council central staff to walk us through the legislation.,6,,
36,0.97,265.231,265.698,Good afternoon.,7,,
37,0.97,265.698,270.303,An Council bill 120120 would return five public records office to civil service.,7,,
38,0.97,270.303,286.619,Most employees of the city of Seattle are part of the civil service system under the city charter unless they are either explicitly leaded in the Charter or exempted by ordinance.,7,,
39,0.97,286.619,302.535,These public records officers respond to requests for elective officials records under the Washington state public records act to respond to records request for the office of the Mayor for the legislative Department and one for the law Department.,7,,
40,0.97,302.535,318.751,Civil service protection provides employees with the right to aggressive discipline and just cause termination and opportunities to appeal decisions for laws and posts.,7,,
41,0.97,318.751,326.559,Hiring of new employees would be guided by civil service rules intended to limit interference and personnel decisions.,7,,
42,0.97,326.559,328.761,And that is all I have.,7,,
43,0.97,328.761,337.236,It is a pretty simple bill.,7,,
44,0.97,337.236,339.105,But I'm ready to answer questions.,7,,
45,0.97,339.105,339.539,"Thanks, Lish.",8,,
46,0.97,339.539,354.887,Straight forward bill to again take a first step towards making sure that we are protecting the integrity of those that we ask to be responsible for shepherding through the public service request for elected officials.,8,,
47,0.97,354.887,362.261,Are there any questions for Lish about the legislation?,8,,
48,0.97,362.261,364.664,I'm not seeing any hands raised.,9,,
49,0.97,364.664,376.409,"Is there any questions or comments on the legislation before I ask the clerk, before I move the bill?",9,,
50,0.97,376.409,376.609,Okay.,9,,

67,0.97,427.56,441.908,Four favored and none opposed the committee recommends passage of 120120 and forwarded to the July 19th meeting.,20,,
68,0.97,441.908,454.987,Thanks for your work and Breanna Thomas that spent time that last month on developing the legislation together with Lish and folks from the city attorney's office and Seattle I.T.,20,,
69,0.97,454.987,455.521,And PDO.,20,,
70,0.97,455.521,459.459,So really excited to get full Council to consider that bill.,20,,
71,0.97,459.459,466.098,Next up is agenda item 2. will the clerk please read item 2 into the record?,20,,
72,0.97,466.098,492.058,Agenda item number 2 Council bill 120124 ordinance relating to the ordinance of city government creating office economic and revenue forecast adding a new chapter 442 amending section 3.39.010 and 3.39.05 and appealing section 3.40 and 40 and chapter 82 of the Seattle municipal code for briefing discussion and possible vote.,21,,
73,0.97,492.058,493.359,Thank you so much.,22,,
74,0.97,493.359,498.698,Colleagues I'm excited to discuss this legislation that has been nearly nine months in the making at this point.,22,,
75,0.97,498.698,516.682,I believe that establishing an independent office of economic and revenue forecast will create a more open and robust process that will enhance the Council and public's access to understanding of the city's budgetary forecast.,22,,
76,0.97,516.682,535.501,The implementation of this office should also improve the dynamic between future Council and future mayors by building a stronger foundation of Truss and balance and access to critical information between the branches and concept of developing the city's budget priorities.,22,,
77,0.97,535.501,547.813,There were two prominent episodes last year that highlighted for me and many others how important it is to level the playing field between the couple and the Mayor's office with regard to our access to information stemming from the city's forecasting process.,22,,
78,0.97,547.813,563.195,This prompted my and my staff and central staff to work together to look at alternative models and indeed both Washington State and King County utilized independent forecasting offices that are outside of the legislative and executive branches.,22,,
79,0.97,563.195,581.981,I also wanted to thank and acknowledge the work of Councilmember Mosqueda and our budget chair that was cosponsor of that budget proposal in last year's budget and included it in her final proposed revised balanced budget for the Council to consider and I'm very appreciative of that support.,22,,
80,0.97,581.981,611.21,King County of course went so far as to pursue a voter approved charter amendment in 2008 to create the office of economic and financial analysis and I will get to the point of why they had to go to that extraordinary effort and why we do not have to pursue that extraordinary effort to Affectuate the Implennation of financial analysis.,22,,
81,0.97,611.21,613.245,Based on my review.,22,,
82,0.97,613.245,621.387,Again we are able to establish our own independent office consistent with the city charter and applicable state law under the budget authority act.,22,,
83,0.97,621.387,631.297,And the legislation we are considering is reflective of the back and review by our city attorneys' office.,22,,
84,0.97,631.297,644.41,And specifically I just wanted to spend a little bit of time talking more about that particular analysis.,22,,
85,0.97,644.41,675.808,We now the budget aspect tells us how to engage in the city process and upon reviewing the legal advice from our city attorney's office it is very clear to me that this ordinance as proposed does not run afoul of the budget act or any of the provisions within the budget act that would water down or otherwise encumber the authority of the council as the budget appropriation authority or the Mayor in her ability to propose a budget.,22,,
86,0.97,675.808,687.453,This ordinance falls squarely within the bounds of the laws of the budget act at the state level.,22,,
87,0.97,687.453,704.67,For the city charter King County created a budget forecasting office that required amendment to charter 310 because the King County charter unlike Seattle's chart places it in the executive branch.,22,,
88,0.97,704.67,706.038,There is no similar provision.,22,,
89,0.97,706.038,711.844,There is no executive branch as the King County charter uses that term in our charter.,22,,
90,0.97,711.844,741.173,"And in our case the Mayor and city council share legislative power under Seattle's charter and that is found in city charter article 4 section 1. in addition, within the Charter we see that our charter allows the legislative authority in the city which again includes city Council and the Mayor by defamation and our charter to create departments unless the Charter says we cannot do so in particular areas.",22,,
91,0.97,741.173,783.883,"So again, just wanted to make sure that Councilmembers you and members of the public understand the authority of the Council to pursue this particular ordinance as we have and to make sure that members of the public understand why we are doing this by ordinance as opposed to a Charteramendment and the bottom line is that our city charter does allow us the authority by ordinance to create a forecast Council, to create this new office and to have it be a shared responsibility between the executives and the Council.",22,,
92,0.97,783.883,791.891,So with that being said I'm going to hand it to counsel staff.,22,,
93,0.97,791.891,795.294,We have Tom and Alli of the budget manager with the Council central staff.,22,,
94,0.97,795.294,804.537,I will hand it to you folks to introduce yourself and walk us through this presentation.,22,,
95,0.97,804.537,806.672,Thank you Council Presiden Gonzelez.,23,,
96,0.97,806.672,813.979,I am from Council central staff and will turn it to Tom to introduce himself.,23,,
97,0.97,813.979,817.817,Good morning.,24,,
98,0.97,817.817,818.284,Or good afternoon.,24,,
99,0.97,818.284,818.584,Thank you.,24,,
100,0.97,818.584,821.854,Tom Mitzel central staff.,24,,
101,0.97,821.854,822.188,Thank you.,25,,
102,0.97,822.188,826.625,I will briefly describe the proposal.,25,,
103,0.97,826.625,848.013,I will walk through the city's current process for the economic forecast and highlight key proposals and the process we wept through to develop it and highlight some of the policy considerations that are discussed in more detail in the staff memo for the city's consideration and Tom and I are both available to answer questions should you have them.,25,,
104,0.97,848.013,862.261,So as Council President described Council bill 120124 would establish a new office of economic revenue forecast that is independent of the executive and legislative branches of government.,25,,
105,0.97,862.261,870.369,Before the bill I will describe the current process for the revenue forecast.,25,,
106,0.97,870.369,877.243,The city's revenue forecast it is made bit Mayor and city council for the city's many funds.,25,,
107,0.97,877.243,887.553,The forecast provides projections of revenues for the coming budget year and trends population and other economic variables that drive the revenue estimate.,25,,
108,0.97,887.553,896.795,Currently the director of finance and the Department of finance and administrative services is authorized by code to provide economic and revenue forecast in coordination with the city budget office.,25,,
109,0.97,896.795,913.412,"But in practice, the revenue forecast is currently produced by analysts and economists in the city budget office with some support from FAS and presented to the Mayor and city council by the CB Odirector and their staff.",25,,
110,0.97,913.412,929.995,The 2021 adopted budget included two measures to serve as the starting point for an independent forecast like the Washington state economic and revenue forecast Council and the King Council analysis.,25,,
111,0.97,929.995,948.047,They have independent offices that are providing this independent analysis to both branches of their government for their adoption processes and as well as supplemental budget decisions through the year.,25,,
112,0.97,948.047,958.757,Currently the city budget office for Seattle provides a forecast update about three times per year.,25,,
113,0.97,958.757,986.051,"The budget actions in the 2021 adopted budget reserved $150,000 in finance general to fund this new office for 2021 and placed a proviso on $330,000 in the city budget office's adoptive process for 2021.",25,,
114,0.97,986.051,1000.833,"If the proposal before you today is passed by the Council, supplemental actions will be necessary to create the positions for the new office and transfer those funds that were reserved for the start-up costs.",25,,
115,0.97,1000.833,1029.294,"So in terms of developing this proposal, since January, our central staff and some of the staff and Councilmember's offices have been meeting to discuss the parameters of the new office and the makeup and responsibility of the proposed forecast Council and all of those discussions inform the proposed legislation and working closely with the city attorney's office as the Council President described.",25,,
116,0.97,1029.294,1039.705,It would create a new Council and establish the process for approval of the official's forecast and establish the duties and functions of the new forecast office.,25,,
117,0.97,1039.705,1047.613,And also update certain financial reporting requirements that are included in the municipal code already.,25,,
118,0.97,1047.613,1063.529,Transferring responsibility for providing financial condition reports from the city auditor to FAS and clarifying some of the reporting requirements that are already included in the municipal code for FAS and as well as accomplishing regular reporting by this new office.,25,,
119,0.97,1063.529,1066.465,So the bill first would create a forecast Council.,25,,
120,0.97,1066.465,1071.203,The forecast Council will be comprised of the city Council President.,25,,
121,0.97,1071.203,1081.447,The Councilmember that serves as the chair of the Council's Finance Committee.,25,,
122,0.97,1081.447,1088.42,And the elected officials on the forecast Council may designate someone to attend on their behalf.,25,,
123,0.97,1088.42,1096.328,The Council would be responsible for selecting and recommending approval and removal or hiring Aen firing of the director of this new office.,25,,
124,0.97,1096.328,1104.069,And then the director would be responsible for hiring personnel to staff the forecast Council.,25,,
125,0.97,1104.069,1113.812,The forecast Council would approve the plan for the new office and provide oversight and approval of the forecast produced by the forecast office.,25,,
126,0.97,1113.812,1126.358,The new office led by director as I noted selected by the forecast Council will present scenarios to the forecast Council.,25,,
127,0.97,1126.358,1127.259,Pessimistic and baseline and optimistic.,25,,
128,0.97,1127.259,1135.968,The director will make a recommendation to the forecast Council on which scenario should serve as the basis for the official forecast for that period.,25,,
129,0.97,1135.968,1161.16,"And just as a reminder for the committee, typically the city has followed sort of a baseline model in their forecasting in 2020 the city budget office in April and perhaps in August but it may have just been once did present the alternative scenarios and we have since then been using the pessimistic assumptions.",25,,
130,0.97,1161.16,1171.069,The state has another example does present three scenarios to their oversight board and then selects the official forecast from that.,25,,
131,0.97,1171.069,1180.179,So the director will make a recommendation to the forecast couple on which of the scenario should serve as the basis for the official forecast for that period.,25,,
132,0.97,1180.179,1186.151,And that recommendation will stand as the official forecast unless any member of the forecast Council disagrees with that recommendation.,25,,
133,0.97,1186.151,1191.823,"If they do, they can call for a vote to approve an alternative scenario.",25,,
134,0.97,1191.823,1199.097,But again if no vote is called for the recommendation of the director stands.,25,,
135,0.97,1199.097,1203.235,The forecast coming out of that process would be considered the official forecast.,25,,
136,0.97,1203.235,1229.394,As the chair describes state law provides for the Mayor and the city Council to propose reasonable alternatives so the proposed legislation does account for that only adding a requirement that if either branch chooses to rely on an alternative forecast for any budget decision that Deviates from the official forecast authorized by the forecast Council the change must be described in writing and transmit to the other branch.,25,,
137,0.97,1229.394,1233.699,So both party the are fully informed of the assumptions and why a different path was chosen.,25,,
138,0.97,1233.699,1246.712,Meeting of the forecast couple would be held in public and then at minimum would take place con current with forecast updates but the number of meetings during the year ultimately would be determined by the forecast Council.,25,,
139,0.97,1246.712,1251.883,So the forecast Council would provide oversight to this new office.,25,,
140,0.97,1251.883,1262.794,The new office would be responsible for staffing the forecast Council performing economic and revenue forecast and conducting special studies at the request of the forecast Council.,25,,
141,0.97,1262.794,1271.403,And providing ad hoc Analytical support on economic and revenue estimates for legislative and executive staff consistent with the work program.,25,,
142,0.97,1271.403,1287.452,The office would consist of a Three-And-A-Half full time equivalent employees including a new director position and a new data analyst position and a lead economist position that would be transferred from the city budget office.,25,,
143,0.97,1287.452,1307.072,And .5Ftes of economic position that is currently a position that is shared between FAS and the budget office and would now be shared between FAS and this new economic and revenue forecast office.,25,,
144,0.97,1307.072,1321.82,The proposed legislation LOCATES the office within the city Finance division in FAS and provides that the office would receive administrative support from FAS to reduce some of the administrative costs of establishing this new office.,25,,
145,0.97,1321.82,1335.567,"And generally the new office will require $660,000 ongoing everywhere fund support as currently proposed 170,000 of that is existing resources that would be transferred from the city budget office.",25,,
146,0.97,1335.567,1338.704,"The remaining 490,000 will require ongoing general funds support.",25,,
147,0.97,1338.704,1350.382,So as presented in a staff memo the question before the committee is why consider modifies the city structure related to economic revenue forecast.,25,,
148,0.97,1350.382,1367.032,Creating a new office to provide independent forecast and economic analysis is intended to increase transparency and create a level playing field between both branches and enhance the city's Work-Related forecast and other economic analysis and creates Consistentsy with other government agencies.,25,,
149,0.97,1367.032,1379.678,As noted doing so does come with trade offs moving this function to a new office with increased costs compared to the status quo.,25,,
150,0.97,1379.678,1385.15,The policy choice is do the changes justify the additional costs?,25,,
151,0.97,1385.15,1399.131,To achieve the policy goals described in the staff memo and those described by the Council President additional resources would be necessary even if it remains in the executive branch and existing Department.,25,,
152,0.97,1399.131,1414.146,Giving the competing demands on the budget office staff that currently do that forecasting work or both doing forecasting and other physical policy work it is unlikely that more detailed and regular reporting and some of the other enhancements can be achieved without additional resources.,25,,
153,0.97,1414.146,1436.701,In addition some of the goals may not be achievable if the forecasting function remains within one gram as leveling the playing field between the branches when and how information is transmitted and whether or not there's a strategic information in how it is delivered.,25,,
154,0.97,1436.701,1443.942,That concludes this and I am happy to go to questions or go in to details about next steps.,25,,
155,0.97,1443.942,1459.057,Any questions about details of the bill before we go to next steps?,26,,
156,0.97,1459.057,1459.591,Looks like no questions.,26,,
157,0.97,1459.591,1467.098,"Ally, that was super thorough and your memo detail and I appreciate the attention into the memo that we have had for quite some time.",26,,
158,0.97,1467.098,1467.632,I appreciate that.,26,,
159,0.97,1467.632,1482.514,Do you want to talk about next steps really quickly and we will see if there are any general comments on the bill after I make a motion for our discussion.,26,,
160,0.97,1482.514,1483.915,Sure.,27,,
161,0.97,1483.915,1484.182,Happy to.,27,,
162,0.97,1484.182,1490.355,If the committee votes to recommend passage of the bill it COB considered July 19th.,27,,
163,0.97,1490.355,1500.065,If it is passed the amendments to the supplemental budget ordinance scheduled for first discussion in the Finance and House Committee on July 20th will be required.,27,,
164,0.97,1500.065,1530.662,If those things occur I will work with the Council president and the budget chair to--and with Tom to develop an amendment to implement the changes necessary to the adoptive process and it would be resources reserved for 2021 to start up this new office that we will be transferring as well as creating the at least the director position so that hiring process can start.,27,,
165,0.97,1530.662,1549.714,"While this would go into effect 30 days after the Mayor signs assuming it is passed by the Council and signed by the Mayor, lit take some time to staff the office to identify a director as well as staff the rest of the positions.",27,,
166,0.97,1549.714,1569.768,"So in the interim, the intent is to consider to work and rely on the work of the budget office and FAS on developing the forecast and starting to convene the forecast Council where they would present first the forecast Council to that body until the new office is operating.",27,,
167,0.97,1569.768,1580.812,Which ally at this point we would anticipate that the forecast Council would be fully implemented for the 2022 budget cycle?,28,,
168,0.97,1580.812,1581.279,That's correct.,29,,
169,0.97,1581.279,1595.56,Given hiring Timelines and that kind of thing and may just do some ad hoc meetings in the interim.,29,,
170,0.97,1595.56,1602.167,Any questions for ally or Tom on the legislation?,30,,
171,0.97,1602.167,1613.812,I will move the bill for consideration and I am happy to open it up for any additional comments about this particular Council bill.,31,,
172,0.97,1613.812,1617.048,So if Councilmembers I move passage of 120124.,31,,
173,0.97,1617.048,1617.482,Is there a second?,31,,
174,0.97,1617.482,1617.782,Second.,32,,
175,0.97,1617.782,1619.484,Thank you so much.,33,,
176,0.97,1619.484,1629.461,It has been moved and Seconded and recommend passage of 120124.,33,,
177,0.97,1629.461,1631.696,Are there any additional comments?,33,,
178,0.97,1631.696,1632.497,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",34,,
179,0.97,1632.497,1634.633,Thank you very much.,35,,
180,0.97,1634.633,1635.033,Madam President.,35,,
181,0.97,1635.033,1641.106,I just want to emphasize my extreme excitement and support for this legislation.,35,,
182,0.97,1641.106,1647.012,Thank you Madam president for driving towards this budgetary change and the policy in front of us today.,35,,
183,0.97,1647.012,1682.28,I want to thank ally and Tom who have over the course of the last Year-And-A-Half really identified for me a number of different ways in which comparable jurisdictions and have engaged with their revenue forecast offices and I think setting this up has been a dream come true in some ways to be able to have access to more information and to help our central staff and our Councilmembers and our legislative staff as well as members of the public have a better understanding of the information that goes to creating the forecast and thus our budget.,35,,
184,0.97,1682.28,1691.923,Did want to say thanks to ally and Tom and members of the city budget office and director Ben Nobel and the team at FAS.,35,,
185,0.97,1691.923,1706.504,Especially Glen Lee and want to thank Cody writer and your office Council president and my office for their work on just ongoing conversations related to this topic over the last year or so.,35,,
186,0.97,1706.504,1711.776,I think the questions posed by the central staff memo is good do the additional costs justify the gain?,35,,
187,0.97,1711.776,1722.387,And that is what we should be looking at an for me the question is a good one and the answer is an easy one and the answer is yes.,35,,
188,0.97,1722.387,1725.69,"First, the independent forecasting office is similar type of work.",35,,
189,0.97,1725.69,1727.826,Already conducted by King County.,35,,
190,0.97,1727.826,1762.494,"By Washington State and I know through Tom's research, a body that many other jurisdictions across the country have the benefit of relying upon to have greater alignment across executive and legislative branches and I thing specifically here for us in Seattle being able to have this tool helps us to make sure that there is greater alignment and transparency in our forecasting and budgetary processes in the county and with the state Legislature in terms of creating similar assumptions as we craft our budget priorities and strategies for funding bills.",35,,
191,0.97,1762.494,1777.041,"Second, I think this is a matter of transparency and accountability for the public making sure we are fiscally responsible and using the best information at the time to make forecasts and thus fund the priorities in the budget.",35,,
192,0.97,1777.041,1789.988,This helps to remove some of the politics of the budgetary process and excited about being able to have concrete legislation for years to come so that we have a really transparent process for the community.,35,,
193,0.97,1789.988,1808.439,You can find sort of the details about why that is so important on page 7 of the memo when you see the way in which the transparency and accountability across the branches will benefit from the legislation in front of us.,35,,
194,0.97,1808.439,1820.151,Both in terms of enhancements and the Enhancement section making sure that city has reliable information for the in coming revenue and how we can use that to project certain years and the level and the playing field concept.,35,,
195,0.97,1820.151,1843.842,"I think it is important for us as we receive the revenue forecast to not at the same time receive how those dollars should be spent by one branch of government, executive that had the chance to see the information the emphasis is to help level that playing field to coming up with priorities and whether or not they are shared but priorities on a similar time line.",35,,
196,0.97,1843.842,1857.255,And finally I think that this helps to create greater confidence in our forecasting processes among both members of the Council and among our community that hold us accountable as well.,35,,
197,0.97,1857.255,1863.461,And so that we can come up with our financial positions and our forecasts that then informs our budget.,35,,
198,0.97,1863.461,1891.256,"Just to put it simply, I think that this further shares our goals of greater transparency acting information by elected officials and members of the public and is good, policy making so it is to the questions and sort of the Tradeoffs and the discussion and the memo outlined I think this bill helps to accomplish many of our shared goals across branches and jurisdictions to ensure greater transparency accountability and to help serve the public.",35,,
199,0.97,1891.256,1898.83,Thanks everybody that worked on the legislation and Council President thanks to you for your current sponsorship and looking forward to supporting it today.,35,,
200,0.97,1898.83,1906.371,Thank you so much.,36,,
201,0.97,1906.371,1907.305,Really well stated Councilmember Mosqueda.,36,,
202,0.97,1907.305,1910.074,I also want to share with you all and members of the public.,36,,
203,0.97,1910.074,1923.187,I know that you have seen some information about this in terms of Councilmembers but the transparency piece captain be understated in the past.,36,,
204,0.97,1923.187,1944.309,All of the work done by the city budget office is done behind closed doors and the ability to create this particular office and have a forecast Council does sort of raise the question about being able to have these meetings done in open session.,36,,
205,0.97,1944.309,1965.963,Consistent with the open public meetings act that I personally would be interested in making sure it comes to fruition and in the spirit of transparency for members of the public so they can see exactly how the city's elected officials or their designees are looking at the revenue forecast.,36,,
206,0.97,1965.963,2002.233,This is an instance in which the forecast Council is likely subject to the open public meetings act in bringing the meetings to a public Venue to allow members of the public to get an inside view of how the revenue projections are important and making sure we are protecting the confidential tax information consistent with state law but I think there is a lot to be gained here in terms of the cost benefit analysis question posed in ally and Tom's memo.,36,,
207,0.97,2002.233,2009.741,Any other comments or questions before we call the roll?,36,,
208,0.97,2009.741,2009.941,Okay.,36,,
209,0.97,2009.941,2019.417,I was going to thank the same people that Councilmember Mosqueda thanked.,36,,
210,0.97,2019.417,2036.734,Ditto and thanks because we are now considering this and a solid piece of legislation that represents a consensus agreement between us and the executive barge and we are ready to move forward as we do government at the city.,36,,
211,0.97,2036.734,2048.212,So that being said will the clerk please call the roll on the committee recommendation that bill pass?,36,,
212,0.97,2048.212,2049.814,Mosqueda?,37,,
213,0.97,2049.814,2050.047,Aye.,38,,

221,0.97,2057.855,2070.101,Motion carries and the committee recommends passage of 120124 and forwarded to July 19th city meeting.,46,,

233,0.97,2114.745,2148.079,"This is really important area of investment those of us that serve on the levy oversight committee we get pretty detailed information on a pretty regular basis on these investments and I like to at least once a year bring community partners and deals to the table here, the virtual table to help you know to make sure that the Councilmembers of this Committee and also members of the public understand how these dollars are being invested.",48,,

286,0.97,2533.731,2533.998,Okay.,54,,
287,0.97,2533.998,2534.198,Good.,54,,
288,0.97,2534.198,2539.136,I want to say I'm Aaron Jeffers and coach with the city of Seattle.,54,,
289,0.97,2539.136,2544.174,And thank you for the opportunity to come and talk about coaching.,54,,
290,0.97,2544.174,2559.59,I'm really Passionated about coaching and I think although this year it has been very different as everything has been for all of us I feel like our teamwork was able to do our best to support the programs that we work with.,54,,
291,0.97,2559.59,2564.895,So one of the things that our team did was a group of us.,54,,
292,0.97,2564.895,2579.843,A group of coaches regularly works on a Social-Emotional news letter that comes out regularly and it focuses on self care.,54,,
293,0.97,2579.843,2593.724,Strategies and some examples can be cooking or exercise or reading some of the coach's personal stories.,54,,
294,0.97,2593.724,2605.803,We included resources on videos and Podcasts in the education setting and personally working on that with our own growth.,54,,
295,0.97,2605.803,2618.782,Still working on the news letters coming out and hopefully programs will be helpful and so that is one thing that we have done as a team.,54,,
296,0.97,2618.782,2628.058,I think personally as my own coaching I only work with the Seattle preschool programs classrooms from the Seattle public schools.,54,,
297,0.97,2628.058,2647.711,From September to March think were all remote and that involved obviously I could not support them personally but figuring out their schedule how they would do large or small groups with children.,54,,
298,0.97,2647.711,2654.652,And I also met with the children that weren't on the calls on a regular basis.,54,,
299,0.97,2654.652,2670.501,Sometimes weekly and sometimes Bi-Weekly and just listened and support with what they needed and what was important and valuable to them at different times throughout the year.,54,,
300,0.97,2670.501,2672.503,Because kind of learning together.,54,,
301,0.97,2672.503,2700.531,Because remote learning in preschool and we probably never Tought that would happen before Covid and specifically around high school curriculum with some of the programs that created the curriculum so we worked on specific aspects and still working to implement what was remotely with the children.,54,,
302,0.97,2700.531,2709.673,I would also--let me--and in March the District shifted to hybrid.,54,,
303,0.97,2709.673,2738.969,That was 2/3 of the way in the year and that was conversations around classrooms and how that would work and is it safe and how they would go about doing it and some classrooms had very little children in person and some had a lot and some remote and it shifted to support the children as best we could throughout the beginning part of the year.,54,,
304,0.97,2738.969,2744.441,And when they were in person only two hours and 20 minutes.,54,,
305,0.97,2744.441,2747.211,There was lots of conversations around that.,54,,
306,0.97,2747.211,2787.951,"And Lastly I would say in general and I have heard this from other coaches how impressed I am of the programs and the classrooms I worked with, with what the teachers were able to do and engage the children for most of the year remotely and balancing the remote and the in person and I have been so impressed with what the teachers have been able to do and look forward to continue to support and build and grow with them as we see what happens again thank you for the opportunity for coaching.",54,,
307,0.97,2787.951,2793.023,"Thank you, thank you, Aaron.",55,,
308,0.97,2793.023,2799.963,"I appreciate you sharing those thoughts and Miguel, I am going to kick it over to you.",55,,
309,0.97,2799.963,2809.373,Just share some thoughts as principal and instructional leader and community leader and one that is providing the service second to none.,55,,
310,0.97,2809.373,2809.873,Share your thinking.,55,,
311,0.97,2809.873,2819.316,"Thank you director Shappel and good to see you share person Gonzelez, it has been two years and so much has happened in the interim.",56,,
312,0.97,2819.316,2819.983,Please excuse my voice.,56,,
313,0.97,2819.983,2848.478,I am feeling a little nervous to be in your presence and to have the opportunity mostly to advocate for the neighborhood and with great responsibility that I feel that I am here today and as director Shappel said I'm Miguel and from the International school a proud partner and Awardee for the Paris two levy cycles actually.,56,,
314,0.97,2848.478,2868.799,"Concord is located in the river valley and is in the South Park neighborhood and to give context before I kind of talk about the school year, South Park is a place that is beautiful and diverse and it is a place that where 85% of the students are students of color.",56,,
315,0.97,2868.799,2906.036,"We have the highest percentage of Certificated staff of color in the Southwest Seattle public schools and because of that and what we know about the impact of the pandemic, we felt the pants in our zip code and in the river valley particularly intensely when you think about broader Seattle and King County, and my goal today is not to tell you something new necessarily but just to say that these issues that we face as a community and neighborhood is present and been intensified by the pandemic which we all have experienced.",56,,
316,0.97,2906.036,2948.078,"We have an eight-year short of live expectancy in the neighborhood than the rest of Seattle and 25% higher rate of Asma and Prepandemic and Prerespiratory pandemic and the highest rate of school, of students visiting the heal Rom in the 2018-2019 school year and despite having only 40% returned of the 18 elementary schools that I am aligned with the most visits to the protective health care room.",56,,
317,0.97,2948.078,2951.748,That means symptoms of Covid-19 of students present in the school.,56,,
318,0.97,2951.748,2952.749,Why do I say that?,56,,
319,0.97,2952.749,2956.62,Why do I pitch all of these things?,56,,
320,0.97,2956.62,2966.363,I pitch it because we happen to be in a moment with what director Shappel is responsible for and what I am responsible for and we are all responsible for.,56,,
321,0.97,2966.363,2990.654,"We have the power to continue to do the great things that we are doing and Partnering with the city for example, and working with a dual language program that has the 9th graders achieve college credit in ap classes because of our robust 50/50 model of English and Spanish Byliteracy.",56,,
322,0.97,2990.654,3007.337,"The city funds .25 principal for the school that is a vital piece of our work and it also funds family support worker that has helped families connect to over $300,000 worth of rent monies over the past one year alone.",56,,
323,0.97,3007.337,3018.148,They are critical to the basic needs of our families in order to be in a place to think about academic achievement.,56,,
324,0.97,3018.148,3028.225,Our students have done a year's worth of learning for school but how do we measure what that learning is?,56,,
325,0.97,3028.225,3032.896,I think my school has an ability to redefine what academic success means.,56,,
326,0.97,3032.896,3047.144,I want to ask the city Council and Dwayne and Deel to use our power to leverage more advancements away from standardized testing.,56,,
327,0.97,3047.144,3092.055,We have seen the Standized testing been taken away for two years and it has not mattered to our students at Concord in exchange for restorative practices and partners at Ospi or Seattle partner schools an need Deel to be prescriptive and the city should be and leverage our power to say here is what we need to do to change the outcomes for our students of color that have been negatively impacted I the pandemic and need to you understand why it has impacted the community more intensely.,56,,
328,0.97,3092.055,3092.789,What is environmental racism?,56,,
329,0.97,3092.789,3097.094,Why is the Snohomish Valley the only site and why is the community impacted in South Park in this way?,56,,
330,0.97,3097.094,3113.81,The last thing that I want to say is the reason we moved back into hybrid models in March because the governor said that we had a mental health crisis and the state of Washington for black and Brown children.,56,,
331,0.97,3113.81,3119.316,Deel does work with mental health funding and support and that work needs to continue.,56,,
332,0.97,3119.316,3135.031,My wondering is how do we take action to hold the state accountable to these realities to put students pack into the building during the pandemic.,56,,
333,0.97,3135.031,3144.407,"Our staff, we have a .5 nurse full time and that is Unaccept and and moral bankruptcy, not just in our city but in our State and country.",56,,
334,0.97,3144.407,3173.036,"I think that we can advocate and we can have a different kind of conversation because right now from my perspective with Dr. Pettunio says we are managing oppression and trying to do our best and never going to get out of that, if we don't hold the system accountable and leverage our prospective items.",56,,
335,0.97,3173.036,3173.336,Thank you.,56,,
336,0.97,3173.336,3174.304,Thank you principal Miguel.,57,,
337,0.97,3174.304,3182.379,Appreciate you for sharing your Brilliances and what I will do now is kick it over to Willie.,57,,
338,0.97,3182.379,3182.679,Mr. seals.,57,,
339,0.97,3182.679,3183.847,There he is.,57,,
340,0.97,3183.847,3186.182,All right.,58,,
341,0.97,3186.182,3187.35,Hello and good afternoon everyone.,58,,
342,0.97,3187.35,3191.721,"Hello, good to see everybody.",58,,
343,0.97,3191.721,3197.694,"Hello, my name is Willie seals the Ceo/Cofounder of the Academy for creating excellence.",58,,
344,0.97,3197.694,3203.733,You may hear ace Academy in some circles and that is what we go by for short.,58,,
345,0.97,3203.733,3215.378,"Created in 2012 as a space and opportunity to provide safe spaces for black men, young black men in particular with that are in middle school and also high school within the Seattle area.",58,,
346,0.97,3215.378,3255.251,How the relationship that we have between the city of Seattle and also South King County is that we provide a number of signature programs for ace for middle and high schoolers and we have currently going on right now is our summer learning experience and providing space for rising 8th Raders and 9th graders and four week summer program to where they are learning stem and humanity such as black culture and society and health and wellness and leadership and character development.,58,,
347,0.97,3255.251,3261.424,Te other spaces that have been supportive by the city Deel is what is call our parent cafe.,58,,
348,0.97,3261.424,3271.034,And the parent cafe is a series of network opportunities for our parents that have students that are engaged.,58,,
349,0.97,3271.034,3277.04,What we have understood and learned over time that students as a whole are connected through the schools and or their families.,58,,
350,0.97,3277.04,3286.483,And so this has given us an opportunity to connect with parents on a intentional and authentic level and to learn from them what do they need?,58,,
351,0.97,3286.483,3294.057,Not necessarily what the students need because we have them in the school program and our summer programs but what do parents need?,58,,
352,0.97,3294.057,3295.692,Because for myself I'm a parent as well.,58,,
353,0.97,3295.692,3308.338,I do not have all of the answers for raising my young children but also an opportunity for us to build resources and connect with other parents as well as far as what they need.,58,,
354,0.97,3308.338,3312.809,The last thing that we have provided was a space for educators.,58,,
355,0.97,3312.809,3321.518,That's black educators network and that network we have posted a series of four part series to connect with our local Caterings within the school community.,58,,
356,0.97,3321.518,3326.823,That is within Seattle public schools and guests from outside of Seattle schools within those spaces.,58,,
357,0.97,3326.823,3332.128,And all of this to work over the past year has been done virtual.,58,,
358,0.97,3332.128,3347.777,And now we are currently in a space now to where we are connecting with our students and our students in particular and the last piece that I missed was our famed Saturday program.,58,,
359,0.97,3347.777,3354.517,It started last year of September of 2020 and ran into may of the next year.,58,,
360,0.97,3354.517,3359.556,"We have 50 men in Seattle participate in a virtual learning on their Saturday as a matter of fact, right?",58,,
361,0.97,3359.556,3360.256,During this time.,58,,
362,0.97,3360.256,3368.631,It is from 9:00 A.M.,58,,
363,0.97,3368.631,3371.568,To 12:00 P.M.,58,,
364,0.97,3371.568,3373.536,They are learning everything from stem to sports and music.,58,,
365,0.97,3373.536,3398.661,How did they show up as well and the organization and our program is led by black male instructors that is in the spaces and it gives our students an opportunity to learn more and see themselves in these positions and faces so what has led up to a quick Nugget is we have our summer learning program going on for the next four weeks.,58,,
366,0.97,3398.661,3410.373,From that Saturday program we have hired four interns from our Saturday program to help us out with our summer learning experience.,58,,
367,0.97,3410.373,3426.556,This gives them an opportunity for youth career development and teaching profession career opportunities and then also how to just be able to give some near peer experiences so that way they are not only learning but being able to be mentors to our 9th and 8th graders.,58,,
368,0.97,3426.556,3441.438,This was a great opportunity that we are able to share and definitely provide more information to have you now that we are in a little bit more safer space to possibly come visit our programs and see what the programs are about.,58,,
369,0.97,3441.438,3454.317,And I believe that is Miguel stated it perfectly getting out to see what the programs are about and what we are doing in these community because it is a huge need especially after the biggest year of what is So- called loss.,58,,
370,0.97,3454.317,3455.785,Loss as far as relationship.,59,,
371,0.97,3455.785,3478.608,Intentional relationship in building and connecting with our young people that has been a huge mix and going to after the summer and my last point going after the summer and going back to the school year it is going to be imperative that these authentic relationships continue to happen with our adults and our young people so that why we have a bigger understanding of what is happening and what's going on in our community.,59,,
372,0.97,3478.608,3481.344,Thank you thank you brother Willie.,60,,
373,0.97,3481.344,3483.279,That was great.,60,,
374,0.97,3483.279,3485.915,We are going to keep this going.,60,,
375,0.97,3485.915,3496.259,And I appreciate you Willie for what you and your organization have been doing for these young men throughout Seattle.,60,,
376,0.97,3496.259,3500.597,And I have known you for quite some time and I appreciate it.,60,,
377,0.97,3500.597,3505.401,I will now kick it over to Francisco.,60,,
378,0.97,3505.401,3512.175,If you can come on and share some of your expertise and engage us.,60,,
379,0.97,3512.175,3512.509,Awesome.,61,,
380,0.97,3512.509,3519.516,Thank you for having me.,61,,
381,0.97,3519.516,3523.586,My name is Francisco Ramos and outreach Seattle promise program.,61,,
382,0.97,3523.586,3547.11,I help high school seniors for promise programs and Seattle colleges and everything that goes into enrollment and Onboarding so everything that would be required for them to show up on the first day so specifically before Covid my role would be to be Vetted at high schools to serve as resource for students in classroom presentations and counseling centers.,61,,
383,0.97,3547.11,3571.134,And with Covid entire role has shifted in the way that we at Seattle promise outreach has supported our students and I think the number one think I have learned from this is that our high school seniors and are very resilient and education stopped for them and turned upside down and began again at the same time.,61,,
384,0.97,3571.134,3574.804,"And so connecting, new ways to connect with our students.",61,,
385,0.97,3574.804,3578.675,We were not there physically to support them.,61,,
386,0.97,3578.675,3582.011,"Some of the challenges, I guess we face being on zoom to do financing aid.",61,,
387,0.97,3582.011,3604.434,I don't know how many of you are familiar with the Fasfa or the Wafsa they are hard and challenging especially if you are a first generating college Studentor don't have the capital at home and English is not your first language and a lot to walk through on zoom versus being there in person with a student to help them and their family with that.,61,,
388,0.97,3604.434,3612.875,"Also, we saw a lot of students I work with picked up working either part-time or full time and sometimes becoming the sole or main breadwinner for their family.",61,,
389,0.97,3612.875,3622.819,And so it was harder to connect with them on a time like we operate on business hours.,61,,
390,0.97,3622.819,3637.033,"And, of course, we saw students from educational justice disproportionately impacted by the transition but we did learn some thing to adapt and meet students and to still help them through this process.",61,,
391,0.97,3637.033,3646.275,And I think a big one was being consistent and where information was located and how students could accessory sources with us.,61,,
392,0.97,3646.275,3669.465,We--part of this information accessibility was instead of how we would offer these workshops at the high schools all of the time and it was there and at that specific time we started to offer them and recording them and in making those power points and those presentations available on our Website and communicating to students and access them and in the pandemic I will get two A.M.,61,,
393,0.97,3669.465,3676.105,Emails like I watched this Video and onto the next step can what do I do even though I won't respond until 8:00 A.M.,61,,
394,0.97,3676.105,3676.572,The next day.,61,,
395,0.97,3676.572,3687.817,It gives students an ability to work on things at their own pace especially with just how different life has been.,61,,
396,0.97,3687.817,3694.69,Also just our sessions changing them from the morning to the afternoon and later part of the evening.,61,,
397,0.97,3694.69,3718.514,And making sure we had--we were able to do this year we had interpretative workshops for financial aid and Seattle schools second languages and available to schools as well and avoiding long Emails that is not exactly the most helpful when you are trying to walk through complicated things.,61,,
398,0.97,3718.514,3739.802,"We learn line Graphics were better, short and sweet and to the point and so in connecting students that needed the most support and to make sure we are not just Emailing utilizing the text messages and funny if you put a hand wave Emoji you get more responses from students like see that and respond a lot quicker and calling.",61,,
399,0.97,3739.802,3740.369,Doing multiple follow-ups.,61,,
400,0.97,3740.369,3753.916,Students had a lot--tend to have a lot going on and many of them working and watching and taking care of Siblings and grandparents and parents and making sure that you have those multiple touch points and what is really helpful.,61,,
401,0.97,3753.916,3763.659,"And then also another cool thing that we developed this year was a solid, a more solid parent engagement piece.",61,,
402,0.97,3763.659,3796.058,We were able to get parents Emails and phone numbers so we could give them text and phone call and Email reminders on what their students working on promise process and how we could best support them and at our readiness Academy a small orientation we had a family engagement component so parent and guardians could join and learn how they can best support their student through this application process.,61,,
403,0.97,3796.058,3864.427,"And I think that was cool because in addition to Partnering with high school staff and like Cbos, the high schools, and bringing in families because really does take a community in getting students through these like I'd say challenging forms of financial aid and things like that and really Looping that all together and just Lastly what makes this successful both in person and this last year is I was first generation college student that went to a university and I felt just the number of being pushed through I didn't have any touch points like in the enrollment process but Seattle promise students are supported from application to graduation and someone touching base with them and we see them as people and we know we can support them and so it is really nice I think that students, that we are there for students and they have someone to go to whenever they are picking classes and comes next . on to whatever",61,,
404,0.97,3864.427,3864.961,Thank you Francisco.,62,,
405,0.97,3864.961,3870.499,Appreciate you for what you do and I like the support that you are provided.,62,,
406,0.97,3870.499,3880.109,You just mentioned providing support from students from a to G. application to graduation.,62,,
407,0.97,3880.109,3885.281,That is extremely important.,62,,
408,0.97,3885.281,3892.421,"Next, I will pass this over to Ruth Brown.",62,,
409,0.97,3892.421,3892.855,Hello everyone.,63,,
410,0.97,3892.855,3896.392,Good afternoon Dr. Shappel and distinguished Councilmembers.,63,,
411,0.97,3896.392,3911.641,"I am Ruth Causeey Brown director of the Causeey learning there in Seattle, a preschool provider since inception.",63,,
412,0.97,3911.641,3916.412,We were concerned about preschool students' needs when the pandemic struck in March of 220.,63,,
413,0.97,3916.412,3924.92,Preschoolers as we all know by nature are explorers and scientists and artists and experimental learners.,63,,
414,0.97,3924.92,3928.057,They are learning how to engaged with the world.,63,,
415,0.97,3928.057,3947.943,"So when the pandemic hit and learning shifted on line, I and my team recognized that Preschoolers were at risk missing the opportunity to develop those important socially emotional and Preacademic skill.",63,,
416,0.97,3947.943,3960.423,Causey offered daily Online zoom classes but I wanted to share with you today is that in addition to the Online instruction our team transformed our school bus that we have.,63,,
417,0.97,3960.423,3969.699,It was purchased for school trips but we turned it to a mobile classroom Compliant with all of the Covid safety precautions.,63,,
418,0.97,3969.699,3978.708,The students brought their tools and activity boxes that we had supplied to them earlier at the beginning of the year.,63,,
419,0.97,3978.708,3984.981,The teachers brought their tools and experience and enthusiasm.,63,,
420,0.97,3984.981,3987.249,There is where the magic began.,63,,
421,0.97,3987.249,3989.518,Our home visits were a success.,63,,
422,0.97,3989.518,3992.621,By September all families enrolled and wanted to be on the visit list.,63,,
423,0.97,3992.621,3998.027,It took a lot of creative Scheduleing to make this happen.,63,,
424,0.97,3998.027,4001.197,Because we didn't think everybody was going to sign up.,63,,
425,0.97,4001.197,4020.916,"In addition to constant zoom classes our newly created mobile program provided In- person comprehensive early learning lessons which included math, science physical education and emotional support.",63,,
426,0.97,4020.916,4023.652,We administered student assessment for possible learning indicators.,63,,
427,0.97,4023.652,4044.807,Some families did not have Internet access and we were able be unable to attend the zoom classes so we delivered educational activity packets during the home visits that enhanced the student development skills and matched a weekly theme.,63,,
428,0.97,4044.807,4052.481,These packets included at home activities parents could return the pack its during the next home visit.,63,,
429,0.97,4052.481,4068.664,"And in December, teachers delivered holiday supplies and gifts to spread hope and bring holiday cheer to many that were experiencing unprecedented financial hardship anxiety and grief.",63,,
430,0.97,4068.664,4075.704,Providing these additional services enhanced a sense of school community.,63,,
431,0.97,4075.704,4076.038,Like family.,63,,
432,0.97,4076.038,4085.047,And insured that all students felt able to learn and participating through the academic problems that we were having.,63,,
433,0.97,4085.047,4099.995,Causey learning there is one of many SP providers that adapted the classroom and our programs to provide remote and small groups.,63,,
434,0.97,4099.995,4101.13,Hybrid in person instruction throughout the pandemic.,63,,
435,0.97,4101.13,4104.1,We educators take the new normal one day at a time.,63,,
436,0.97,4104.1,4108.237,And hoping to shed light where there may be darkness.,63,,
437,0.97,4108.237,4128.19,I am building up on my mother's legacy by providing a support system to Causey's educators and ensuring that the center continues to provide children with high quality and earning early education.,63,,
438,0.97,4128.19,4129.391,Thank you.,63,,
439,0.97,4129.391,4131.127,"Thank you, Ruth.",64,,
440,0.97,4131.127,4132.161,I appreciate those words.,64,,
441,0.97,4132.161,4137.233,"Now, what I will do, Teri, you can close us out.",64,,
442,0.97,4137.233,4140.102,Thank you very much and thank you for inviting me.,65,,
443,0.97,4140.102,4144.94,Shared experience with a lot of the other community members.,65,,
444,0.97,4144.94,4160.756,"I'm a nurse practitioner at Ingram high school school base clinic and as I'm sure you know the school based clinics provide a variety of services to adolescents in the high school and the beauty of it is ease of access, no barriers.",65,,
445,0.97,4160.756,4161.857,No costs to families.,65,,
446,0.97,4161.857,4170.432,Students can come in for a regular service or they can seek confidential services and it is a safe place for them.,65,,
447,0.97,4170.432,4201.73,In March of '20 had the pandemic hit there was cheering and hugging in the hall that they were being sent home to social distance and we had to shove them off the door but it settled in it was pretty isolating to be away from the support they needed to reach their goals for next level and for college and their opportunities and graduation.,65,,
448,0.97,4201.73,4206.735,There was a lot of loss and mental health needs were a priority.,65,,
449,0.97,4206.735,4215.244,I am a nurse practitioner and each of the children cans have a mental health provider also and they have been quite busy through the pandemic.,65,,
450,0.97,4215.244,4222.785,What we did was the schools were virtually closed or literally closed to everyone from March until September.,65,,
451,0.97,4222.785,4229.525,So we packed up boxes and put them in the trunks of our car and then got on the phone and connected with our community partners.,65,,
452,0.97,4229.525,4231.727,And in my case it was North public health.,65,,
453,0.97,4231.727,4234.396,I went to the wick office there.,65,,
454,0.97,4234.396,4236.532,And was able to store my boxes.,65,,
455,0.97,4236.532,4241.203,And do visits virtually with students when we could and sometimes we had to see them.,65,,
456,0.97,4241.203,4251.981,There were new students and we needed to get some exams before we could provide Medications for them.,65,,
457,0.97,4251.981,4262.591,And so those clinics were kind enough to offer space to see students.,65,,
458,0.97,4262.591,4283.612,Volumes were low and we took every opportunity to screen for mental health issues and not by is family affected by how is the pandemic affecting family and connecting them with services whether grocery support or how to get tested or how to understand the social distancing that they needed to do.,65,,
459,0.97,4283.612,4299.862,We decided because we didn't have a normal spring that we wrap up and tell students how to get services during the summer we would remain available throughout the summer and we were on call seven days a week throughout the summer of 2020.,65,,
460,0.97,4299.862,4311.073,And sometimes met students in parking lots of libraries or grocery stores or other things to provide them Medications when they needed it or other in person things.,65,,
461,0.97,4311.073,4324.286,And then when the schools opened up in the fall the principals as you likely know in Seattle schools invited the school based health staff back Nto the schools.,65,,
462,0.97,4324.286,4334.363,We entered the janitor's door and had to attest we didn't have symptoms Oric portions and they allowed us to bring students in that same way.,65,,
463,0.97,4334.363,4361.557,When it became apparent that was pretty Stigmatizing for the student they let us bring them through another door and we did that one by one and did not see ill students and that made it a more safe place for students to come and when sports started in the winter some families would not let their students to go to the regular doctor for a checkup because they were afraid they would be exposed to Covid and not Vaccinated.,65,,
464,0.97,4361.557,4367.463,We saw more students in the winter and when school opened appointed spring.,65,,
465,0.97,4367.463,4384.079,You may know that probably only 60% of the students chose to come back and for those students I think it was really helpful for their mental health and the students that didn't come back Interestingly would look for opportunities to peak in the school.,65,,
466,0.97,4384.079,4404.633,Next year what we have to realize in the fall is that we will not only have 9th graders that don't know about high school but a bunch of 10th graders that don't know the building or the staff or know about the high school experience and so we are going to be facing 50% of our students not really knowing high school.,65,,
467,0.97,4404.633,4414.977,And so we are working with the school already to try and plant some things that will make them feel more comfortable to be integrated.,65,,
468,0.97,4414.977,4431.326,Some of them showed up at the vaccine clinics at the fire Department and Seattle cancer care alliance provided in May for Covid and they were peeking around and dying to know how big the gym was and where the office was.,65,,
469,0.97,4431.326,4436.665,So there is a lot of needs there that they will be faced with in the fall.,65,,
470,0.97,4436.665,4448.377,Thank you and I just want to close out by saying that we really admire all of you for your services that you provide.,66,,
471,0.97,4448.377,4464.326,We know that our Seattle scholars benefit from the love that you just exhibit 4 them and I just want to personally thank you for being present with our students and family and making a positive impact on the Ecosystem that they are operating in.,66,,
472,0.97,4464.326,4467.93,"So with that said, Council President, I know we are short on time.",66,,
473,0.97,4467.93,4478.841,I will pass it over to you because--and let you know and you can let me know how you would like us to proceed because we still have a presentation for you.,66,,
474,0.97,4478.841,4479.107,Yeah.,67,,
475,0.97,4479.107,4479.508,Really quickly.,67,,
476,0.97,4479.508,4486.048,I do want to respect the time of our community partners here that have really important work to continue doing.,67,,
477,0.97,4486.048,4531.66,Important work that we just all heard about but I do want to offer my colleagues on the committee an opportunity to ask any questions or make any comments to our community partners who have been really critical to our ability to deliver the services and educational outcomes that we have committed to deliver on our families in Seattle and proud of the work that we heard about and for each one of you there are many others and in our community that are doing equally important work in shared spaces in the community.,67,,
478,0.97,4531.66,4532.928,Grateful for that.,67,,
479,0.97,4532.928,4533.462,Any comments.,67,,
480,0.97,4533.462,4533.962,Councilmember Strauss.,67,,

484,0.97,4547.809,4569.164,You are doing the work from hard times to turning school buses to mobile classrooms and ensuring that our students who are having--Teri the way you explained it on the first day of the pandemic the excitement of going home and how that impacted people and their mental health over the last year during such a critical development time.,68,,
485,0.97,4569.164,4570.766,I just can't thank you enough.,68,,
486,0.97,4570.766,4574.536,Thank you for being on call seven days a week during the summer.,68,,
487,0.97,4574.536,4582.044,Just wanted to take a moment to thank you for this work.,68,,

492,0.97,4586.982,4594.156,Any other comments or questions colleagues for our community partners?,69,,
493,0.97,4594.156,4595.891,I am not seeing any other hand raised.,69,,
494,0.97,4595.891,4599.661,Thanks for taking the time to be with us.,69,,
495,0.97,4599.661,4608.904,And for sharing a little bit more with us about the important work you are doing in partnership with the city and Deel in particular.,69,,
496,0.97,4608.904,4634.096,I a couple of years ago had an opportunity to actually tour many of the Feef levy investment sites and was so inspired by the work in sort of in the buildings on the ground that is being done every single day.,69,,
497,0.97,4634.096,4635.063,Really impressive work actually.,69,,
498,0.97,4635.063,4670.866,Had an opportunity to tour Concord as well and impressive space and learning model and very excited to have an continue to get back into these public spaces to continue to learn together on how to continue to best serve our youngest learners and our Footprint Presidents of the United States of America and entrepreneurs all of whom you are already Nuturing and teaching in your own programs so our gratitude for the work you do every day.,69,,
499,0.97,4670.866,4678.073,It has been a challenging challenging year and you all have been on the front lines.,69,,
500,0.97,4678.073,4687.649,Lifting up and doing your best to make sure that our families are surviving and able to continue to thriving.,69,,
501,0.97,4687.649,4695.323,A lot more hard work to be done BT this crew makes me confident and hopeful that we can deliver.,69,,
502,0.97,4695.323,4695.791,Thank you everybody.,69,,
503,0.97,4695.791,4696.158,Thank you.,70,,
504,0.97,4696.158,4703.632,Directors Shappel you want to take it away with that presentation?,71,,
505,0.97,4703.632,4703.899,Yes.,72,,
506,0.97,4703.899,4704.166,Will do.,72,,
507,0.97,4704.166,4726.588,So if Whoever is driving the power point drive if you could pull it back up that would be helpful.,72,,
508,0.97,4726.588,4729.324,I will take it to our director Monica.,72,,
509,0.97,4729.324,4729.958,"Thank you, Dwayne.",73,,
510,0.97,4729.958,4755.484,So glad to be here and have listened to that inspiring panel and what I was just thinking about is how we as a collective have worked to just bring up some really great innovation during this year.,73,,
511,0.97,4755.484,4767.129,"Flexibility was the big thing and as challenging as it was brilliant minds working together to coming up with great innovations that don't all need to go away, right?",73,,
512,0.97,4767.129,4772.367,So I hope that Ruth continues her mobile bus somehow.,73,,
513,0.97,4772.367,4773.802,Preschool class.,73,,
514,0.97,4773.802,4781.743,Just a brilliant innovation that came out of this and I am confident that we have learned a lot that we can carry forward.,73,,
515,0.97,4781.743,4784.846,If you can go to the next slide.,73,,
516,0.97,4784.846,4801.63,I want to sort of highlight some of these--the Pivots and flexibility and Ed behind the preschool programming.,73,,
517,0.97,4801.63,4804.032,It was a year that no one imagined.,73,,
518,0.97,4804.032,4811.973,If you got me two years ago preschool children could have learned virtually I would have laughed and said that is absurd.,73,,
519,0.97,4811.973,4833.595,We actually encouraged people not to be on the screen but we had children quite successfully with the under the guidance of really skilled teachers with excellent coaching have productive sessions Online and with significant impact or support from their family.,73,,
520,0.97,4833.595,4834.029,It worked.,73,,
521,0.97,4834.029,4842.938,Not necessarily the preferred model but we came out and learned how to support families.,73,,
522,0.97,4842.938,4851.079,"So any way the 20--the school year 2020-2021, we offered three different preschool models.",73,,
523,0.97,4851.079,4851.88,We had 100% in person.,73,,
524,0.97,4851.88,4855.684,A third of the programs offered for the majority of the year.,73,,
525,0.97,4855.684,4862.29,We had another third of our classrooms that were 100% remote.,73,,
526,0.97,4862.29,4867.362,That was mostly the Seattle public schools sites through March.,73,,
527,0.97,4867.362,4869.231,And then another third were in hybrid session.,73,,
528,0.97,4869.231,4875.537,We offered a lot of flexibility and not one size fit all for all providers.,73,,
529,0.97,4875.537,4894.589,And they all made it work for their communities and we also had to know that our priority was helping families and our providers and we had to balance them and make sure we could help everybody get through the situation.,73,,
530,0.97,4894.589,4903.431,"For families, one of the things that we focus on was the tuition.",73,,
531,0.97,4903.431,4905.734,Knowing that economically families were in a hard situation.,73,,
532,0.97,4905.734,4919.547,We waved tuition completely for families that were getting remote services and just across the board reduced tuition by 50% for any other family attending hybrid or in person.,73,,
533,0.97,4919.547,4933.862,We wanted to make sure we were in line with state Co-Pays for six months we did that and we had 50% for the months ending in July.,73,,
534,0.97,4933.862,4949.577,We took to heart the idea that families are the children's first teachers and we wanted to support them and provide quarterly earning packets for families delivered through the programs to support their family's learning at home.,73,,
535,0.97,4949.577,4988.283,"For our providers we wanted to make sure that we had the means to navigate these additional expenses so we gave our providers Coughs Stipends for the classroom for the sanitizing equipment and the Ppe and we made sure that some family support dollars that were new last year we gave a lot of flexibility on that because the providers know best how to support their families and wanted to make sure there were no strings attached and able to do what they needed to, to support their family.",73,,
536,0.97,4988.283,4992.754,You heard Aaron talking about virtual coaching.,73,,
537,0.97,4992.754,4995.223,Thats with incredible innovation and success.,73,,
538,0.97,4995.223,5030.525,Going to 100% virtual coaching actually had some benefits because once we worked out the technological pieces they spent less time in cars driving site to site and to support teachers more quickly and they piloted a very innovative Robotic camera system with some of the providers so that they could do observations and live observations give feedback and that is something that we will carry on next year as well.,73,,
539,0.97,5030.525,5032.994,All of our professional development was 100%.,73,,
540,0.97,5032.994,5046.174,Which again one hundred percent virtual and had the draw backs but in terms of accessibility once we get the technology done the teachers could attend so much easier than to go across town to get there to a workshop.,73,,
541,0.97,5046.174,5055.016,These are areas where we learned things and we will keep some of the practices in place because we actually found out some of the benefits.,73,,
542,0.97,5055.016,5080.041,And then I think you know we are also decided that we will extend the contracts by a couple of months and voluntary basis for the providers could say because we know the year was less than ideal we want to extend for a couple of months and SPD is ending through the year instead of June to give additional time for children.,73,,
543,0.97,5080.041,5086.548,We focused our process evaluation this year on how to deal and respond.,73,,
544,0.97,5086.548,5106.968,We want candid feedback from teachers to see how did we as an organize and as a city agency respond to this so we can learn and improve the processes in the future should we ever need to manage such a situation again.,73,,
545,0.97,5106.968,5112.64,So those are some of the adaptations that we put into place.,73,,
546,0.97,5112.64,5113.575,"Next slide, please.",73,,
547,0.97,5113.575,5142.937,"Some of the highlights for this year, I think the SEC Mentorship program and in addition to the se P it is Ano per tune opportune year to launch it.",73,,
548,0.97,5142.937,5153.982,They could Pivot to that and we could provide a more in-depth update on that in the future.,73,,
549,0.97,5153.982,5172.2,And then very proud of our children Institute that is a year professional development Institute for early learning Department puts on and this year it was just--because it was one hundred percent virtual it just had the highest attendance ever across from attendees from across the country.,73,,
550,0.97,5172.2,5218.112,We had nationally renown speakers as well as local experts that provided three days of professional development and inspirational content for our--for all of our teachers beyond early learning and accessible to all of our K through 12 and the focus was Uplifting the brilliance and how do we elevate that and that was such a theme that Resonated with all of us and all of our--all of our educators and very successful and one of those silver Linings in this because probable if we had it in person it would not have as far of a reach as it did this year.,73,,
551,0.97,5218.112,5219.18,Next slide please.,73,,
552,0.97,5219.18,5224.752,To sort of show you actually the number of children that we served.,73,,
553,0.97,5224.752,5231.492,As you can imagine our enroll many was lower this year than expected.,73,,
554,0.97,5231.492,5242.47,We did have to reduce our available feet because of social distancing requirements.,73,,
555,0.97,5242.47,5257.452,We served 1500 children and you can see across the three years it has held consistent in the percentage of children.,73,,
556,0.97,5257.452,5258.052,And that was encouraging.,73,,
557,0.97,5258.052,5263.358,And we also continued to grow during this time.,73,,
558,0.97,5263.358,5269.697,And we are really looking forward to next school year.,73,,
559,0.97,5269.697,5276.404,Where we are planning for a one hundred percent person program for next year.,73,,
560,0.97,5276.404,5308.002,Still allowing flexibility for providers if they know the community and if there's some particular community need allowing flexibility as we transition back to 100% in person but you know we hear the enrollment is approaching Prepandemic rates so families are feeling more confident about sending children back to preschool so that is exciting and we plan to serving about 3000 children next year.,73,,
561,0.97,5308.002,5309.837,All thing are a go for next year.,73,,
562,0.97,5309.837,5334.362,"And then finally if you go to the next slide, this is just we know that Council is interested in understanding better who we are serving specifically and so this is a breakdown of the different race Ethnicities of our children in the Seattle preschool program.",73,,
563,0.97,5334.362,5340.868,So you can see that the 28% of our children your black African- American and 22% are white and it goes down from there.,73,,
564,0.97,5340.868,5356.684,And if you go to the next slide it breaks down the different subgroups into further detail because that is the direction that we are going with our data.,73,,
565,0.97,5356.684,5367.261,We want to make sure to de segregate it so we are understand who it is that we are serving.,73,,
566,0.97,5367.261,5371.632,So that concludes the early learning update.,73,,
567,0.97,5371.632,5379.207,"I will let my colleague, Dana, talk about K12 and then we can do questions if that's the plan.",73,,
568,0.97,5379.207,5380.908,I think that's the plan.,74,,
569,0.97,5380.908,5381.109,Yes.,74,,
570,0.97,5381.109,5393.621,We will go through the presentation and Councilmembers will have an opportunity to ask questions on make comments.,74,,
571,0.97,5393.621,5394.122,That sounds good.,75,,
572,0.97,5394.122,5403.765,"Good afternoon thank you so much for the opportunity to be in front of you today and you are still having us, thank you so much.",75,,
573,0.97,5403.765,5408.069,You can go onto the next one.,75,,
574,0.97,5408.069,5414.242,I will speak a little bit as Monica did about the adaptations from our staff and partners this year.,75,,
575,0.97,5414.242,5430.324,As you have heard through the panel and through what has been shared so far this was just incredible year of resilience and endless amounts of creativity and dedication to serve the families and students.,75,,
576,0.97,5430.324,5446.541,It was a year of modification not just once and we figured out what it would look like but multiple times as public health circumstances continued to evolve and the school year progressed and we had to evaluate and reevaluate constantly as the circumstances on the ground were changing.,75,,
577,0.97,5446.541,5458.753,As you heard others say I want to give my credence to the many partners that we had that did this incredible work this year and that kept to it.,75,,
578,0.97,5458.753,5460.755,It was no easy feat and we are grateful.,75,,
579,0.97,5460.755,5469.964,I will speak to a few of the adaptations that took shape in the K12 space.,75,,
580,0.97,5469.964,5508.069,It was the change in the way we delivered health services and so not only when we were thrown into virtual environments not only did we Pivot for TELE health services we also were able to get back to school buildings through partnerships with public health and the school partners to make sure the in person option continued as well as extended to community and our community clinics continued to be a space where students and families could go and access mental health care and required constant adaptations as circumstances on the ground changed.,75,,
581,0.97,5508.069,5513.674,So a real Testament to those that continued that work this year.,75,,
582,0.97,5513.674,5535.763,And another example of highlights of adaptations was around all of those across our many investment streams that made it possible for families to continue to accessory sources by setting up Pickups and Drop-Offs and compiling resources whether food assistance or technology resources or learning materials and making them available.,75,,
583,0.97,5535.763,5546.641,Sometimes at a coordinated school drop off or at a park or sometimes directly to students and families homes.,75,,
584,0.97,5546.641,5555.082,And it just again is a Testament and and elsewhere too.,75,,
585,0.97,5555.082,5564.759,I want to call out specifically some of the Adaptive services to continue academic support for students.,75,,
586,0.97,5564.759,5572.5,Here again endless amounts of activity from our educators partners in school.,75,,
587,0.97,5572.5,5594.388,We saw examples of this take shape as to you materials for individual plans and doing Check-Ins with Online texts and Email with a phone call just to let students know they were cared about and missed and supported.,75,,
588,0.97,5594.388,5622.35,And in very specific tools we saw tirelessly teachers meeting their students that were experiencing homelessness and basic needs and making sure that students had safe places for in person support and nutritious meals and community Parters sites for transportation to and from and so that students can be supportive in their remote learning.,75,,
589,0.97,5622.35,5632.593,Incredible effort by a lot of partners around a dedicated goal to make sure that services to students continued and that their academic progress continued.,75,,
590,0.97,5632.593,5655.416,And one more thing there to our colleagues at a middle school where we saw partners implement powerful practices around restorative justice and the coordinator partner September Clark that grappled with staff racial equity issues and really worked to build in facilitate community circles with students.,75,,
591,0.97,5655.416,5661.922,Build their leadership capacity to such a point that they are going to be poised to take on themselves and as we enter a new school year.,75,,
592,0.97,5661.922,5670.131,"Those are just of the few many, many examples of the adaptations that were made across our partners and our partners site throughout this past year.",75,,
593,0.97,5670.131,5677.438,I could go on all afternoon but I know that our time is limited.,75,,
594,0.97,5677.438,5680.441,So we will move onto the next slide.,75,,
595,0.97,5680.441,5694.755,Here again this tugged at my Heartstrings to be able to narrow the number of highlights to be honest but I do want to call out a couple of remote learning highlights and a couple of those in our programming space.,75,,
596,0.97,5694.755,5725.019,"So around remote learning as you heard Monica speak to just a moment ago, we really learned a lot and were pushed in a lot of ways to make sure that we were engaging families not only more frequently but in new and different ways and we know that we will continue a lot of this work heading to the new school year ahead whether that be through home visits or more frequent types of support and we saw really interesting and intriguing models of how parents were being worked with.",75,,
597,0.97,5725.019,5737.331,We had creation of academic support and academic parent teacher teams that had intentional connection to do the work and do the work in both home and school context that will absolutely continue.,75,,
598,0.97,5737.331,5745.372,We saw our school and CBO partnerships come together to provide One-On-One in small group support and very specialized ways.,75,,
599,0.97,5745.372,5756.283,Around individual learning and some of that will also help us to continue great services to students and new ways as we head back to in person environments more frequently.,75,,
600,0.97,5756.283,5774.535,We saw to the credit of many of our colleagues in elementary and high school spaces the creation of opportunities for kids not just for their academic help but for their creative outlets and for their social and emotional Well- being.,75,,
601,0.97,5774.535,5813.307,And new enrichment programming clubs took shape after school and opportunities were created and we saw very cool drama clubs pop up in the space for students to really still express themselves and have a chance to have a release and what was an intense year and then Lastly as I mentioned before we saw numerous partners make sure that resources were in the hands of students and families through very intentional creation of not just materials themselves and project kits but also have some very necessary needs such as food and clothing and other basic needs.,75,,
602,0.97,5813.307,5849.043,Responsive programming side it is exciting to say that we not only figured out how to adapt but we figured out how to expand and so in the Seattle program we saw them adapt to virtual context and not OM continue to provide that relevant identity affirming experience for our traditional for school partners with team makers but also to create the key makers of Seattle extended program so that Kings across the stick could access and connect with team makers and mentors and Facilitators.,75,,
603,0.97,5849.043,5862.423,With we saw multiple mental providers create in person near peer One-On-One and small group opportunities for students to connect with one another and with caring adults and caring friends.,75,,
604,0.97,5862.423,5873.701,That was so critical to their health throughout the year.,75,,
605,0.97,5873.701,5892.553,And then Lastly in our educator diversity we were able to expand and exciting not to expand the Academy for rising pathways and to see the first graduating class for the Academy for rising educators that just happened this last June.,75,,
606,0.97,5892.553,5905.199,Here we saw over 30 rising educators from black indigenous and people of color communities and their a Aand honored at this event and they will go to certification programming this fall.,75,,
607,0.97,5905.199,5916.01,Just a few and so many more that we can speak to from K12 to secondary.,75,,
608,0.97,5916.01,5924.451,Similar to what Monica shared I want to give you a sense of who we serve specifically.,75,,
609,0.97,5924.451,5932.893,"I want to call us as Dwayne shared this is a progress report, not a culminating report.",75,,
610,0.97,5932.893,5935.529,I can't to acknowledge this is preliminary data.,75,,
611,0.97,5935.529,5949.276,We expect more to come and to give you sense here will you see themes what I shared that speak to the persistence and resilience and growth that has been a challenging 18 months.,75,,
612,0.97,5949.276,5977.037,In our school base investment that top row you see over the past three years as we transition to Feff from the previous family and indicating levy we were able to increase not only our numbers but the percentage of Bipoc youth that we served that was exciting and our health investments we continue to expand and now in 29 school base centers.,75,,
613,0.97,5977.037,6005.966,And elementary and middle high schools in the District and you see what I spoke to the expansion of our educator diversity foot print and more participants taking advantage of multiple pathways to earn the certification and to become educators representative of our student population in our schools.,75,,
614,0.97,6005.966,6007.968,Go ahead.,75,,
615,0.97,6007.968,6013.107,We have the racial perspective in mind.,76,,
616,0.97,6013.107,6032.926,You see we were able to support thousands of students in 30 partner schools and you see that right down by race and Ethnicity with our African- American students.,76,,
617,0.97,6032.926,6033.694,Go ahead.,76,,
618,0.97,6033.694,6035.896,You can move this along.,76,,
619,0.97,6035.896,6055.716,And similarly again here you know that we are very hard at work to make sure that we continue to desegregate in ways to give us information as to how well we are serving students and families and how we need to adapt and change them better to reach our goals.,76,,
620,0.97,6055.716,6060.654,Here is the de segregation by some of the race and Ethnicities and some groups.,76,,
621,0.97,6060.654,6074.368,I will let you take a look at them before we move on.,76,,
622,0.97,6074.368,6075.302,Thank you.,76,,
623,0.97,6075.302,6076.103,We can move along.,76,,
624,0.97,6076.103,6091.485,Still on the K12 investments you heard me speak a moment ago to King makers of Seattle that is exciting example of culture responsive programming specific to black and African-American youth.,76,,
625,0.97,6091.485,6106.567,Here we see that we were able to extend the number of Kings served through the program and excited to say this past spring we ran a funding opportunity to Expad this and we will be beginning services in two additional high schools.,76,,
626,0.97,6106.567,6119.947,We also speaking of growth and expansion we were able to still start in a remote context and brand new investment strategy that was our opportunity and access investment strategy that began during the pandemic year.,76,,
627,0.97,6119.947,6131.058,School year and we have 14 partner organizations here serving over a thousand students.,76,,
628,0.97,6131.058,6138.665,And from academic enrichment base and expanding learning opportunity to college career readiness experiences and also work for youth and adults.,76,,
629,0.97,6138.665,6145.372,More to come in our final report there but exciting to be able to launch that during the pandemic.,76,,
630,0.97,6145.372,6180.507,"And Lastly, speaking to some of the family support services that we were able to provide through the Feff levy, you see expansion in terms of the number of students that we were able to serve here the incredible people during this work on the ground and worked Tiredlessly for 20 schools and through the native American education program at SPs to make sure that students had that care coordination and had access to the things that were Nonacademic and make sure that they were successful in their academic pursuits.",76,,
631,0.97,6180.507,6189.049,This is absolutely necessary work and grateful to our partners in that space.,76,,
632,0.97,6189.049,6189.449,Go ahead.,76,,
633,0.97,6189.449,6200.561,"And then into the post secondary environment where through Seattle promise we see the same themes of persistent, resilience and growth.",76,,
634,0.97,6200.561,6216.276,We saw the largest beginning of year end roll many to date this past fall and we welcomed promise scholars this first and second year and shortly follow by the highest number of applications received to date in the spring of 2021.,76,,
635,0.97,6216.276,6223.717,Many of whom will go on to become scholars this fall.,76,,
636,0.97,6223.717,6237.364,Exciting to see and come fruition that college culture to work to cultivate in partnership with the Seattle college partners and Seattle public schools partners and community members across the city.,76,,
637,0.97,6237.364,6249.676,One thing to note here again speaking to that growth and expansion from previous school year to this one we saw expansion in the number of high schools that were welcomed to the program.,76,,
638,0.97,6249.676,6267.894,We were now able to accept graduates from 17 high schools that was exciting and speaks to the Testament of the city to that culture across every part of our city geographically.,76,,
639,0.97,6267.894,6272.132,Again here we see who was taking advantage of those services.,76,,
640,0.97,6272.132,6278.405,So this is Seattle promise enroll many represented by race and Ethnicity.,76,,
641,0.97,6278.405,6293.453,Our largest Subgroup was the White students were represented 26% of the total students enrolled followed by our Asian students at 21% and black and African-American students at 18%.,76,,
642,0.97,6293.453,6315.742,And if you move us to the next side similarly is what you saw before you will see this further desegregated by racial Subgroup that is data that we continue to track and make sure that it continues to inform the implementation of services going forward.,76,,
643,0.97,6315.742,6333.393,"And with that, I hope that I have left us at least a little bit of time to not only thank all of the Councilmembers that are present today but to reiterate thanks to the panelists that were able to join us and I think were able to take questions if that's all right, Dwayne.",76,,
644,0.97,6333.393,6333.627,Yes.,77,,
645,0.97,6333.627,6334.027,That is right.,77,,
646,0.97,6334.027,6342.202,I'm kicking it back over to Council President to see if there are questions or comments.,77,,
647,0.97,6342.202,6342.469,Great.,78,,
648,0.97,6342.469,6344.638,Thank you so much.,78,,
649,0.97,6344.638,6347.074,Colleague any comments or questions?,78,,
650,0.97,6347.074,6349.376,"It is a very thorough representation, presentation.",78,,
651,0.97,6349.376,6373.7,Really appreciate an opportunity to do a deeper dive and also just want to say I know Councilmember Mosqueda has brought this up several times around the de segregation of the ethnic and racial data and appreciate to have an opportunity to see that and implemented on the presentation to know you have been hard at work to accomplish that.,78,,
652,0.97,6373.7,6386.246,It is really useful to see that desegregation and thank for having that reflected and I would be Remiss in acknowledging this is Dana's last time in our committee.,78,,
653,0.97,6386.246,6415.976,She is leaving the city family for other adventures and Dana we have had a wonderful time getting to know you as the division director and long time staffer at D. O. and appreciate the work you have been doing through the K through 12 space and we wish you lots and lots of luck in your next adventure and hope that you won't be a strange tore us and our community partners.,78,,
654,0.97,6415.976,6418.912,Thank you for your public service to the children and family of our city.,78,,
655,0.97,6418.912,6420.147,Thank you so much.,79,,
656,0.97,6420.147,6422.349,That is so kind of you to say.,79,,
657,0.97,6422.349,6424.518,It is a mixed emotion.,79,,
658,0.97,6424.518,6433.96,I love the Deel family and good hands going forward but thank you for acknowledging that.,79,,
659,0.97,6433.96,6434.294,Of course.,80,,
660,0.97,6434.294,6435.529,Of course.,80,,
661,0.97,6435.529,6437.764,"Any questions or comments, colleagues?",80,,
662,0.97,6437.764,6440.267,I know this was a very long presentation.,80,,
663,0.97,6440.267,6440.7,Really well done.,80,,
664,0.97,6440.7,6455.715,I wanted to just ask one quick question here and I know that Councilmember Mosqueda will have to leak us early to get to another commitment but thank you for being with us through the entire presentation.,80,,
665,0.97,6455.715,6481.508,One of the things that is interesting about the implementation and plan for the levy is that it does require that under spent dollars be spent for early learning and I think that what we experienced in this unprecedented year last year was Underspend and we had in the Feff levy came from the area of early learning.,80,,
666,0.97,6481.508,6514.674,And just wanted to give you Monica and Dr. Shappel an opportunity to sort of talk about the Department's thinking around how to address that moving forward or if you anticipate that Underspent complexities that we experienced last year in early learning will effectively self resolve given that we anticipate that we will be at 100%?,80,,
667,0.97,6514.674,6516.276,In person starting next school year?,80,,
668,0.97,6516.276,6516.543,Yeah.,81,,
669,0.97,6516.543,6520.48,I will start us off and then Monica you can take it away.,81,,
670,0.97,6520.48,6540.1,I can tell you that we are trying to be intentional with what we are doing and moving forward and taking some deeper thought for our team to look and say this is what we want to do and I think it is going to be ongoing and Monica if you wanted to Shareling thoughts or words at all for us.,81,,
671,0.97,6540.1,6540.367,Yeah.,82,,
672,0.97,6540.367,6549.009,"I mean I think one thing that we have learned is it is really hard to predict exactly how you will spend your dollars, right?",82,,
673,0.97,6549.009,6557.551,And we are grateful that we had to spend to be direct and unexpected demands this past year.,82,,
674,0.97,6557.551,6561.855,I think--I do believe that our spending will go up this year.,82,,
675,0.97,6561.855,6569.563,I fully expect that just because a lot of the special programming didn't come to full fruition.,82,,
676,0.97,6569.563,6581.241,But we are thinking about all of the different ways and all of the different learning that we have had in the past year and how we might you know--it is not back to normal.,82,,
677,0.97,6581.241,6586.713,Everything is not back to normal this year.,82,,
678,0.97,6586.713,6591.351,Our providers are still going to be recovering financially for a while.,82,,
679,0.97,6591.351,6619.913,And we want to make sure that we are supporting them properly and thinking about the--and waiting to see what the long- term impacts are on our families and our providers and on student learning and so it is definitely as Dwayne says it is a process that we are looking at carefully this upcoming year.,82,,
680,0.97,6619.913,6620.447,Council President.,83,,
681,0.97,6620.447,6625.352,I'm sitting in a house all by myself on mute.,84,,
682,0.97,6625.352,6626.286,That make no sense.,84,,
683,0.97,6626.286,6659.185,I also wanted to just ask a quick question about the investments around homelessness in particular so one of the things that we Prioritized was investments in housing Instabilityity for children in the K through 12 system and you also create additional support and opportunities for investment in access to child care services specifically for families that might be experiencing homelessness.,84,,
684,0.97,6659.185,6671.197,I want to get a sense of any trends that you all are seeing in those investment areas?,84,,
685,0.97,6671.197,6671.464,Dana.,85,,
686,0.97,6671.464,6673.6,I will let you take it.,85,,
687,0.97,6673.6,6673.833,Yes.,86,,
688,0.97,6673.833,6675.368,I can speak to that.,86,,
689,0.97,6675.368,6675.568,Yeah.,86,,
690,0.97,6675.568,6679.706,It has been a really interesting year just as you said.,86,,
691,0.97,6679.706,6697.19,This is a new investment area for us and one that was Codesigned with multiple partners including colleagues at the YMCA and Seattle public schools and over at human services Department at the city.,86,,
692,0.97,6697.19,6702.996,And it continues to be a collaborative adventure to access the students that we want to serve.,86,,
693,0.97,6702.996,6714.407,Through this investment stream% we had a narrow audience and looking for students and families that were in housing and secured circumstances.,86,,
694,0.97,6714.407,6717.61,And to your question about trends.,86,,
695,0.97,6717.61,6734.694,One thing that we have experienced throughout the year has been some hesitancy and some real fear about changing circumstances and to leave what feels like a stable environment for Ustable future.,86,,
696,0.97,6734.694,6749.976,So we have worked really hard to take that feedback to adapt and to adjust the types of financial supports that we have made possible to families and I thing we will continue that absolutely for the rest of this calendar year.,86,,
697,0.97,6749.976,6773.399,"In addition, I think some of the trends that we have seen is the type of resource that families are seeking has largely fallen in food assistance and not always in housing that is interesting and again this is specifically for some of our school based partners through the Mckinny office.",86,,
698,0.97,6773.399,6792.619,So I certainly think that we have a lot of learning to continue in this space and look forward to continue with our oversight committee and others to get resources to the families that need it most.,86,,
699,0.97,6792.619,6803.997,"I think from the child care perspective, pretty much we just saw that families need higher subsidies and longer.",87,,
700,0.97,6803.997,6818.878,I think current policies are being evaluated because recovery is just going to be much--take much longer and then the other thing that we are trying to do with all of our child care subsidies is Aligning with the state.,87,,
701,0.97,6818.878,6830.423,The state is changing its policies very rapidly and we need to respond Accordingly so there is not a gap or not a complete misalignment.,87,,
702,0.97,6830.423,6842.168,We have been working all year long to stay aligned with the state and our programming as well as the homeless.,87,,
703,0.97,6842.168,6843.036,But more support.,87,,
704,0.97,6843.036,6851.344,I think that's going to be the key as we continue in the next few years.,87,,
705,0.97,6851.344,6852.412,Longer subsidies as well.,87,,
706,0.97,6852.412,6853.346,Yeah.,88,,
707,0.97,6853.346,6854.781,That makes sense.,88,,
708,0.97,6854.781,6854.981,Okay.,88,,
709,0.97,6854.981,6863.957,You are not seeing the same sort of trend in terms of hesitancy or--some of the trends that Dana described?,88,,
710,0.97,6863.957,6871.097,I haven't heard that but I can verify.,89,,
711,0.97,6871.097,6871.364,Okay.,90,,
712,0.97,6871.364,6871.598,Great.,90,,
713,0.97,6871.598,6873.733,All right.,90,,
714,0.97,6873.733,6876.269,Colleagues any other questions or comments for Deel?,90,,
715,0.97,6876.269,6876.569,All right.,90,,
716,0.97,6876.569,6879.272,I am not seeing any hands raised.,90,,
717,0.97,6879.272,6888.281,I want to say thank you so much for the presentation and for incorporating community partners into the presentation today.,90,,
