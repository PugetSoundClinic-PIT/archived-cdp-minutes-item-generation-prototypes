0,0.97,654.086,662.228,"Hi, my name is David Johnson and I live with four other people.",0,,
1,0.97,662.228,664.13,I don't know how we will ever pay rent.,0,,
2,0.97,664.13,689.121,Three of the people during the pandemic were unemployed and some of them still are and we have rent that will be due and I have my savings for other things and they have their savings for other things and I have no idea how we will make that work so I have to find some other place to live.,0,,
3,0.97,689.121,690.389,I get along well with my landlord.,0,,
4,0.97,690.389,699.598,The frustrating thing is I have lived there five years and I have probably paid the most for that mortgage.,0,,
5,0.97,699.598,706.472,I am out $1000 and have nothing to show for it.,0,,
6,0.97,706.472,723.589,"I know a lot of people are in worse shape than I am because of had a job this whole time but will make it to the end of this moratorium, I will be looking at a bed I can't pay and we need help.",0,,
7,0.97,723.589,726.492,We need you to help us.,0,,
8,0.97,726.492,730.563,We have done all the right stuff we can do.,0,,
9,0.97,730.563,733.732,That is all I have.,0,,
10,0.97,744.844,745.911,That is our final Speaker.,1,,
11,0.97,745.911,758.924,"Okay, thank you to all the speakers offered their testimony today and it has been extremely important in reminding everyone that is watching this of how real of a crisis this is.",2,,
12,0.97,758.924,773.839,"For her first agenda item, we will hear about another crisis that is right in front of us which is the climate catastrophe and we will hear from activists and organizers.",2,,
13,0.97,773.839,794.46,The skies in Seattle were a vivid reminder of the devastating impacts of climate change on our lives and the smoke is not a one-time thing but a new normal.,2,,
14,0.97,794.46,797.429,That is just one way that climate change is reshaping the world we live and.,2,,
15,0.97,797.429,805.237,The drying out season is stretching on both ends according to the research published just in August during the Wildfires.,2,,
16,0.97,805.237,819.685,There are temperatures and less precipitation and the all sent of winter rain so we have probably not even seen the end of it this year.,2,,
17,0.97,819.685,828.06,The rest of fire season has extended by at least 84 days since the 1970s.,2,,
18,0.97,828.06,856.822,"California's fire protection service has said publicly that they no longer consider there to be a Wildfire season because it is now practically the entire year and unless globally and in America we have massive resistance to change, we will see a more extended fire season and that is just one of the crises we are facing.",2,,
19,0.97,856.822,924.29,"A lot of climate scientists that are setting the fire episodes on the West Coast this year are pointing out that the increase in the temperatures will lead to mass migration Úfrom the South and you will se that within the United States as well and what they are pointing out is as difficult as that crisis will be because we will see tens of millions of people and many of them are already stricken with poverty and many of them to our community of color that have been marginalized and we will see that crisis because their whole lives will be uprooted and on top of that, they are pointing out that the West Coast fires are just one type or one manifestation and they will see other types of crisis and during the same height of the Wildfires in the West Coast, the coast of Louisiana saw some of the worst hurricanes ever.",2,,
20,0.97,924.29,931.597,What they are pointing out is this crisis is so huge that simply migrating will not be the answer as difficult as that will be because the places people migrate to will have other types of crises.,2,,
21,0.97,931.597,960.359,"We are seeing the climate catastrophe in many different ways so it is a serious reminder for us of how urgent this crisis is and we know stopping climate change will require reshaping the entire infrastructure of our society and too often, people are told that there are sacrifices and totally insufficient.",2,,
22,0.97,960.359,966.432,"When you look at the mathematics, that is simply not the answer.",2,,
23,0.97,966.432,983.716,"If we address the crisis, it misses the point with the financial industries that are responsible for the overall majority of greenhouse gas emissions and leaves working people filling defenses and powerless.",2,,
24,0.97,983.716,990.522,It makes it even worse.,2,,
25,0.97,990.522,1025.457,We know they are not empowered under capitalism to decide how electricity is generated or how the resources of our society are invested and we just saw a breakthrough investigative reporting in the last weeks which showed since the 1970s that the oil and plastic industry is engaged where there was a complete misinformation and that is yet another example of how the entire system works.,2,,
26,0.97,1025.457,1028.494,It is not based on conspiracy theories but this is the reality of the system.,2,,
27,0.97,1028.494,1051.683,"That is why it is so important for activists to be organizing and those that are fortunate to be on the panel, they have been organizing for years and some of the demands to stop investing the vast wealth of our society into the infrastructure and are fighting for a green new deal.",2,,
28,0.97,1051.683,1111.577,"I want to remind everyone and I want to put this article up to Úshow and remind people that Ou activists have been misled with indigenous fighters and so many of our communities of color and leaders have been on the front lines and one of the things we have succeeded in passing is the Wells Fargo ordinates and many the panelists that are here today and the reason we were able to win that, I'm proud of my office being involved in that and having the good fortune to sponsor the ordinance and we knew when we passed that it was only the first step of what we need to achieve and we needed to get to the actual farming and that is something they would also be talking about today.",2,,
29,0.97,1111.577,1115.481,This discussion is scheduled to go for maybe 20 or 25 minutes so I will go to the panel now.,2,,
30,0.97,1115.481,1120.052,Please introduce yourselves before you begin speaking and I'm looking forward to sharing your comments.,2,,
31,0.97,1128.227,1129.294,Do we have our speakers?,3,,
32,0.97,1129.294,1131.263,Sorry about that.,4,,
33,0.97,1131.263,1165.13,"Hi everybody, my name is Rachel Heaton and I am Edison of the Duwamish people of the lands that we all call Seattle now and one of the Cofounders that was part of the work in regards to Wells Fargo and I want to say thank you for the opportunity to speak to you all today.",4,,
34,0.97,1165.13,1186.151,I think we all come in a number of capacities whether it is the parents or community members and I know I am speaking as a native woman in those waters that the offices stand on.,4,,
35,0.97,1186.151,1228.56,"People still live and practice cultural ways out of those waterways and so, I think it is important to recognize that in the past that we typically have not had places at the table and had these conversations to talk about things like the investment and in the ways of decisions that are made by the city, also what is going on with our current climate situation and crisis that literally affects our everyday lives.",4,,
36,0.97,1228.56,1241.773,We hear fishermen come in every day I can't feed their families because they are not able to assist in the water has heated up so fish are not returning and plants are dying.,4,,
37,0.97,1241.773,1248.18,Part of what we are seeing now unfold with the whole situation is we see that Disconnect between community and leadership.,4,,
38,0.97,1248.18,1279.111,"I think a big part of that is a lot of us that are affected by these situations are not at the table and I think we are seeing that with committees and things that are made I know in the city and I live out here by our barn, we see leadership making committees and those decisions not being made with community members.",4,,
39,0.97,1279.111,1313.178,"A lot of times, native people are not at those tables and one example I wanted to talk about was our journey out on the Puget sound for the last two years at this time and we have had those waters that have kept us from being able to practice our cultural ways and as the treaty tribe of these particular areas, I think part of the work that I am doing is making sure that we have a seat at the stables and are creating these relationships.",4,,
40,0.97,1313.178,1331.063,"So, one thing we ran into last year in July 2019 was the raw sewage going into the water and us not being allowed to put our canoes in order some of us having to take precautions because we could not touch the water.",4,,
41,0.97,1331.063,1340.505,"Little by little and even with the fires that took place in our canoes being in water, we are seeing our cultural practices being taken from us.",4,,
42,0.97,1340.505,1356.521,Part of the work that I am doing and that you will hear from many of the panels is making sure we are creating the relationships and having these voices at the table versus us hearing about it after decisions are made.,4,,
43,0.97,1356.521,1388.82,"I know what I want to see is the cultural practices continue to be understood and realizing that the climate crisis affects native people first and by having us at the table, it's allowing us to come to you and tell you the ways that we need this help and these relationships and I think we will hear more about that.",4,,
44,0.97,1388.82,1390.255,That's it.,4,,
45,0.97,1390.255,1391.056,"Great, thank you, Rachel.",5,,
46,0.97,1391.056,1398.163,I think I am up next.,5,,
47,0.97,1398.163,1406.905,"Hi everyone, my name is Sulakshana.",5,,
48,0.97,1406.905,1414.88,Thank you for having me and I want to thank all the people that made public comment.,5,,
49,0.97,1414.88,1426.591,Climate crisis and structural equities are sharing with how Seattle can push one sector to stop climate change.,5,,
50,0.97,1426.591,1438.603,"As many of you know, cities are tied up through their dollars and one financial service that is often overlooked that has an impact is the insurance industry.",5,,
51,0.97,1438.603,1455.52,The insurance industry is the fossil fuel economy with major investors and we provide insurance for reconstruction of projects.,5,,
52,0.97,1455.52,1464.129,"Without it, pipelines can't get financed or built.",5,,
53,0.97,1464.129,1476.274,Purchases of insurance are well placed to push the insurance industry to have their voice to a growing call across the Finance sector.,5,,
54,0.97,1476.274,1499.164,"So, cities screening for insurance companies that have policies on fossil fuels on human rights is one logical step in allowing the financial services with its values and Sustainability goals to date, they are restricting insurance.",5,,
55,0.97,1499.164,1521.753,"Six insurers Seattle has contracted with as of fall of 2019, none of them have such policies and two of Seattle's insurers, Elijah and WR Berkley are ensuring the pipeline which would care heavenly bills of oil every day down to Vancouver.",5,,
56,0.97,1521.753,1531.429,A makes the Resorts and violating rights of indigenous people.,5,,
57,0.97,1531.429,1534.065,Tribes across Washington have publicly opposed the project.,5,,
58,0.97,1534.065,1577.442,There is precedent for the cities and counties pressuring companies to adopt these policies and San Francisco adopted a policy to screen their insurers and Porter County became the first County to do so and just yesterday I heard a talk from the Commissioner that shared that as they have been implement the Úpolicy and talking to Insuranc companies that they have gotten a lot of surprise from them which underscores the importance of educating the industry and demonstrating public pressure that is needed to push these companies to stop business as usual.,5,,
59,0.97,1577.442,1587.919,"In April 2020, New York City sent a letter to three key companies calling on them to adopt policies.",5,,
60,0.97,1587.919,1613.445,"So, I just wanted to share this and I have been in talks with some of you about what this will look like and we will follow up and there is a lot of leverage that the city has to really push the sector and follow-up on the amazing work around Wells Fargo.",5,,
61,0.97,1613.445,1622.787,Thank you.,5,,
62,0.97,1622.787,1623.688,"Okay, I'm next.",6,,
63,0.97,1623.688,1625.69,Thank you so much for the opportunity to be here.,6,,
64,0.97,1625.69,1626.758,My name is Jonathan Fikru.,6,,
65,0.97,1626.758,1645.01,I grew up in Seattle and Seattle has been my home and I also recognize that I am also a visitor and that this is the place of the Amish folks and I want to recognize that.,6,,
66,0.97,1645.01,1654.285,"So, I wanted to talk about the time of this conversation.",6,,
67,0.97,1654.285,1665.697,"Last weekend, we got our air quality back and I know the Wildfires are still burning right now in places like Washington and California and Oregon.",6,,
68,0.97,1665.697,1705.804,"I also want to highlight that tomorrow will be one year since the global climate strike in which millions of young people marched and strike for the climate and here in Seattle, there were 10,000 people that marched from Anderson to city hall for justice and it was a really cool moment to see the youth led movement and the workers that showed solidarity and I just wanted to highlight that tomorrow will be one year since the climate strike happened.",6,,
69,0.97,1705.804,1717.482,It is not a coincidence that the Wildfires have intensified on the West and also that the hurricanes hit in the Gulf with hurricane Sally and Laura.,6,,
70,0.97,1717.482,1722.053,It is not a coincidence.,6,,
71,0.97,1722.053,1749.748,"When I was younger, my schools were teaching me that these were called natural disasters and I'm happy to hear that is a term that is outdated because I think everyone knows that there is nothing natural about these disasters and I also wanted to add that there is a story that came out a week ago about one of the fires in California that started because of agenda reveal party and that is unfortunate.",6,,
72,0.97,1749.748,1762.694,I think we all know here that these extreme weather patterns are the results of the methods and how this country Procures its energy.,6,,
73,0.97,1762.694,1773.338,"You know, it is no coincidence with the digging and the burning and the dumping and using things to gain energy.",6,,
74,0.97,1773.338,1783.748,That is contributing to the lower temperatures and Conjuring to the longer seasons of Wildfires.,6,,
75,0.97,1783.748,1796.461,The extraction of how energy is procured has been absolutely contributing to what is happening out here.,6,,
76,0.97,1796.461,1840.805,"So, today I'm speaking as an Organizer for the climate justice for black lives and just a brief background, a collective of black and indigenous people of color, some of us have a lot of experience and some of us are just new to the movement but we all carry brilliance and strength from our trust with each other and relationships and especially because we are a block indigenous collective and we wanted to put out an event because we wanted to center the conversation between box finds matter and criminal justice and we also understand that we can't fix the crisis without black liberation.",6,,
77,0.97,1840.805,1887.285,"For me with my personal experience, my mom has asthma and I'm sure everyone on this panel and in counsel, there are people in our lives that have a respiratory condition so when Covid hit, there was the vulnerable population and this pattern of multiple crises, that is something that may affect black folks and people of color that they have to face the climate justice for black lines, this crisis is now and there are folks that have been experiencing this for years.",6,,
78,0.97,1887.285,1918.683,There are areas outside of America where things are vanishing and the reality of the situation is we need to invest in the community and it is a really serious thing and I appreciate being on this panel.,6,,
79,0.97,1918.683,1958.189,I am committed to fighting for climate justice because I know a better world is possible shoulders of giants like justice is nothing new and there are folks on this panel and folks nationally and locally and there is such a rich history of black and indigenous people of color even in Seattle and I just want to recognize the legacy of people that I have not met yet and I just wanted to name that and say thank you for all of the work that everyone is doing and I hope you are taking care of yourselves.,6,,
80,0.97,1958.189,1962.327,"Thank you, Jonathan.",7,,
81,0.97,1962.327,1968.333,"If we go to slide two, please.",7,,
82,0.97,1968.333,2001.032,"[speaking foreign language] first of all, thank you Councilmember Sawant for opening up the space to talk about this serious issue of the climate crisis as well as all of the support you have given us for several years now on quite a few issues including the Wells Fargo investment.",7,,
83,0.97,2001.032,2003.267,Before I jump into words with what we are involved with.,7,,
84,0.97,2003.267,2012.276,I just want to echo the public comments and show support for the Renters and call for stopping the rent.,7,,
85,0.97,2012.276,2025.79,I live in district 2 in beacon Hill and we absolutely support what those folks are calling for.,7,,
86,0.97,2025.79,2036.067,Mazaska talks was an outgrowth of the work we were involved with on trying to stop the Dakota access pipeline.,7,,
87,0.97,2036.067,2092.457,"We zeroed in on the financial companies and looking at who had energy transfer partners to have that pipeline and zeroed in on Wells Fargo in particular is one of the major Funders of that pipeline and thanks to the support of Councilmembers Sawant and Mosqueda for supporting the ordinance to hold the city and of its relationship with Wells Fargo, it really sparked not only a regional and national but International movement of individuals looking at how the financial sector is divesting the role it can play in addressing these pipelines and other companies.",7,,
88,0.97,2092.457,2115.446,Rachel did not mention this but she was part of a delegation that went to Europe with other indigenous peoples to call out European-Based insurance Companis and banks and stuff like that to respect indigenous rights and to stop financing and funding the fossil fuel industry.,7,,
89,0.97,2115.446,2138.569,That is where Mazaska talks had its growth from there and we got involved with the treaty alliance against the expansion and the treaty alliance is a coalition of around 150 first nation governments in several tribal governments on the U. S.,7,,
90,0.97,2138.569,2151.682,Side who have come together to oppose any of the proposed pipelines that the administration has been pushing for.,7,,
91,0.97,2151.682,2161.459,We were asked to bring in the investment angle and language which we did and started a campaign after several those pipelines.,7,,
92,0.97,2161.459,2216.047,A couple have been stopped although we are still facing the keystone XL pipeline as well as the one selection that was Referencing the amount pipeline and that is not only into Vancouver but one of the Offshoots of that pipeline that is down just north of us so we can see a massive increase coming down and around and into those different ports so we absolutely support any and all means going after financial companies and the banks and insurance companies to try to stop these different pipelines.,7,,
93,0.97,2216.047,2218.983,"Let's jump to number four, slide four please.",7,,
94,0.97,2218.983,2244.075,We are big believers that you can engage locally to try to have an impact on addressing the climate crisis and it will require more than what the city of Seattle does but we can certainly become a model of what other jurisdictions can engage in.,7,,
95,0.97,2244.075,2271.268,We have seen this in the past and Councilmember Sawant worked with us on the indigenous people resolution to abolish the in Seattle and that movement sparked across the country and now we are up to 100+ cities and towns and States that have passed similar abolish resolutions.,7,,
96,0.97,2271.268,2279.944,We saw this with that investment of Wells Fargo take off to other cities around the country and really around the world as well.,7,,
97,0.97,2279.944,2304.735,We had the honor to work with Councilmember O'Brien last year on the screening deal and were successful in passing a resolution and ordinance to hopefully get Seattle to be fossil fuel three by 23 which is an aggressive goal.,7,,
98,0.97,2304.735,2320.184,"With that said, now is the time for those in leadership to move beyond statements and really begin to put money into addressing the climate crisis.",7,,
99,0.97,2320.184,2336.267,What you see are some of the budget funding areas that we would like to see Seattle moving to for the next year.,7,,
100,0.97,2336.267,2352.65,The first one being funding assistance and support for homes and buildings and one of the biggest areas of fossil fuel omissions for the city is the burning of oil and gas in homes and buildings.,7,,
101,0.97,2352.65,2363.661,We like to see assistance especially for homes to convert off of oil and gas to 100% Renewables.,7,,
102,0.97,2363.661,2380.845,Another strategy in reducing the carbon Footprint is finding assistance to support the weather stations of homes and buildings which is another area that would like to see city support and.,7,,
103,0.97,2380.845,2410.808,"Again, in the ordinance, we call for the establishment of a renewed deal which would be made up of 19 members with the labor and impacted communities and environmental justice groups and tribes to oversee some of the work going into the deal and see that the city is living up to its commitments.",7,,
104,0.97,2410.808,2422.219,We see fossil fuel omissions and so far the executive branch continues to refuse the funding for staffing for the oversight board.,7,,
105,0.97,2422.219,2442.006,We would like to call on the city and folks to push hard for that funding to go for the staffing position as well as the Stipends for low income and youth participation in that board.,7,,
106,0.97,2442.006,2465.629,Number five is a worker program to be established for those workers that are currently in oil or gas charms and some sort of training program to help them transition into green economy jobs.,7,,
107,0.97,2465.629,2478.843,We would not see that as equitable to start eliminating some of these jobs and not give our working brothers and sisters an opportunity to transition into good paying jobs within the green economy.,7,,
108,0.97,2478.843,2480.444,"If we can jump to number five, please.",7,,
109,0.97,2480.444,2482.146,"Actually, jump down to number six.",7,,
110,0.97,2482.146,2517.448,"Right towards the end of Councilmember O'Brien's tenure on the board, we are working on the healthy homes healthy building ordinance and would encourage the city to take this ordinance and pick it back up and what it was calling for was a ban on oil and gas and any new homes or buildings in the city as just says, one of the first steps is to stop making it worse.",7,,
111,0.97,2517.448,2551.782,"We encourage the city to pass this ordinance and one thing on natural gas, the city of Seattle through Puget sound energy gets the bulk of the natural gas out of British Columbia and Alberta where the majority of these sites are on or next to the first nations communities so native relatives to the North are suffering with what is taking place on their lands for us to heed our homes and buildings here in Seattle.",7,,
112,0.97,2551.782,2568.432,We know the issue of indigenous women is directly tied to these sites and related with what we are seeing in British Columbia around the sites.,7,,
113,0.97,2568.432,2584.214,Addressing or passing this band with the climate crisis and it addresses the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women.,7,,
114,0.97,2584.214,2594.158,One of the main byproducts is methane which is actually a far worse greenhouse gas than carbon.,7,,
115,0.97,2594.158,2596.427,"Next slide, please.",7,,
116,0.97,2596.427,2607.371,We know we need to ultimately get away from putting the city's money with any of these Wall Street banks.,7,,
117,0.97,2607.371,2617.982,We encourage the city Council to work with the Senator who has been working on a plan for a number of years now.,7,,
118,0.97,2617.982,2647.011,"We got a budget plan passed last year but it was vetoed by the governor due to Covid so we encourage the city to work again on a budget plan so that if and when a state bank is established, the city of Seattle can engage in the depository services with a state bank.",7,,
119,0.97,2647.011,2649.413,"If we can jump to the last line, I will wrap up.",7,,
120,0.97,2649.413,2664.028,I just want to encourage folks to come out on October 2 two a global day of action against the pipelines and those that are funding it or giving insurance to it.,7,,
121,0.97,2664.028,2683.347,There will be actions throughout many cities as well as Online support so you can go to stop the money pipeline to get connected with that and thank you for your time.,7,,
122,0.97,2683.347,2684.148,"Thank you, matt.",8,,
123,0.97,2684.148,2699.963,I know just will speak next but I want to note that we are at 11:49 and I apologize for the shortness of the discussion.,8,,
124,0.97,2699.963,2710.074,This is not the last discussion by any means but I did want us to fit this and before the Council goes to the budget and I know Councilmembers will have comments and questions which I wanted to make a few minutes for before we go to the next item.,8,,
125,0.97,2710.074,2714.445,Are you aiming for one minute or three minutes?,9,,
126,0.97,2714.445,2715.646,Just a few minutes.,10,,
127,0.97,2715.646,2724.855,I appreciate this and I don't need a ton time because so much has put here.,11,,
128,0.97,2724.855,2725.255,I have him.,11,,
129,0.97,2725.255,2740.871,When it was 11 and I am an Organizer with the 50 Seattle and we are a nonprofit that is making systems change and we work in three areas of resisting fossil fuels and building towards the just resigned community centered future that we need.,11,,
130,0.97,2740.871,2768.132,Just a lot of gratitude for the folks that shared before me and with the priorities I heard from folks in the comic period hearing about the need for rent cancellation and the powerful national solidarity happening and I think that is where the work is and it makes me particularly excited to talk to you about some of the new deal priorities.,11,,
131,0.97,2768.132,2776.039,I just want to share a personal thing.,11,,
132,0.97,2776.039,2794.658,"When I mentioned the ideal future, we can talk about policy and funding but for me, it starts with thinking about what the future looks like and feels like.",11,,
133,0.97,2794.658,2796.126,"In some ways, it is quite simple.",11,,
134,0.97,2796.126,2804.368,"No matter who you are or what is in your wallet or what you look like, you have a chance to be healthy and play and grow and learn and work and dreamed of a future that feels stable and healthy.",11,,
135,0.97,2804.368,2826.757,That feeling is what we are working towards and that means addressing systemic injustices that are keeping so many of us unstable and that means being real about the crisis that we face with economic injustice and the climate crisis and transforming from the Extractive economy.,11,,
136,0.97,2826.757,2844.274,To an economy that recess in place with care and an economy that will take care of us and future generations.,11,,
137,0.97,2844.274,2850.347,I just have a little bit of time here today but I want to lift up one community solution that is important and exciting and accessible in the coming years.,11,,
138,0.97,2850.347,2868.599,The city council committed to the goals of the campaign last year which is to eliminate the climate pollution by investing in solutions that will create good and green jobs and I just injustices and make our communities healthier.,11,,
139,0.97,2868.599,2874.538,There are a lot of ways we can do that and one the most powerful is to think about how we can build affordable housing that is coupled with transmit.,11,,
140,0.97,2874.538,2898.228,"Straight up, the most effective thing we can do per dollar spent when it comes to reducing the climate pollution is to build affordable housing and couple it giving people in place and making sure they can be with families and jobs and don't have to move as we face a crisis.",11,,
141,0.97,2898.228,2912.142,It is also one of the most important things we can do to take care of our people and that need has never been more clear than this pandemic and you heard about that at the beginning of this call.,11,,
142,0.97,2912.142,2922.486,Even people in place and making sure their communities are stronger and more resilient which we need when you were climate impacts.,11,,
143,0.97,2922.486,2926.89,It is also a critical strategy for public safety and another moment to lift up intersections.,11,,
144,0.97,2926.89,2951.515,"Our work is deeply connected with racial justice and what you think about what it means to me just so need so they can take care of one another and be strong and healthy and they don't have to depend on the Extractive economy, we begin to withdraw with the systems that are destroying our planet and ripping our communities apart.",11,,
145,0.97,2951.515,2957.02,"Affordable housing is a much bigger conversation and something that is talked about and as we go into budget, it will be an important priority for us.",11,,
146,0.97,2957.02,2963.627,I look forward to talking with the community and learning more about it.,11,,
147,0.97,2963.627,2964.127,Thank you.,11,,
148,0.97,2964.127,2972.336,Thank you to all the panelists for this engaging an important presentation.,12,,
149,0.97,2972.336,2993.724,"I wanted to invite Councilmembers if you would like to speak, please indicate to me by raising your hand or sending me a message or any of those means.",12,,
150,0.97,2993.724,3007.07,"I don't see any Councilmembers speaking right now and in the meantime,--actually, Councilmember Pederson, did you want to ask a question?",12,,
151,0.97,3007.07,3009.039,"Okay, I just saw you come off mute.",12,,
152,0.97,3009.039,3049.813,One question I have for the panelists and any of you can take this is matt mentioned one of the slides that was a key slide in the presentation was the city government needs to take on in order to make specific and concrete and not just talking but taking action to reduce the carbon Footprint and the point was well made of a limiting sandals carbon is a tall order given how things have gone so far.,12,,
153,0.97,3049.813,3051.214,What will it take to accomplish that?,12,,
154,0.97,3051.214,3097.427,"It will take concrete changes and one of those, you matt talked about which is the conversion of buildings to Renewables and I think one thing that I would like you to bring out this discussion is the jobs that could be created and not just jobs but unionized living wage jobs with training programs and apprenticeship programs that can be created with programs like Weatherization and conversion of buildings to clean energy and so if you can talk about that in general and tie it to what the city council should be doing in the 20 Sawant budget to address that.",12,,
155,0.97,3097.427,3102.365,Absolutely.,13,,
156,0.97,3102.365,3137.701,"Just, I will kick it over to you on the jobs part but I wanted to point out that when we were meeting and developing the green new deal, it was an essential part of that and we recognized that we were talking about Electrification and that it will be workers that will be removing the gas and oil movements and electrifying them so it is essential that we have the units on the table alongside us.",13,,
157,0.97,3137.701,3147.377,I don't know how to do that stuff and I'm sure a lot of other folks don't know how to do that either so it is important to have their voice and experience at the table.,13,,
158,0.97,3147.377,3234.798,"In terms of programs, I have seen some around the country that Seattle could potentially model when it comes to green jobs and one of them actually being from where I am from and one of the things that the Council engaged in was to bring solar energy to a number of our districts and communities and what they did was partner with local tribal colleges to provide apprenticeships and Trainings for any tribal member or folks that wanted to learn how to build solar panels and install solar panels and engage in the maintenance of solar panels and after the apprenticeship program, they were put to work and in that area and that pipeline, it was constructed and the District now has several solar panels that bring energy to that particular district so I can imagine Seattle has numerous colleges and trade schools that could be creative in figuring out these apprenticeship trade programs and what they look like and how to engage with them.",13,,
159,0.97,3234.798,3239.469,"Just, do you want to say anything more on that or anyone else?",13,,
160,0.97,3239.469,3239.97,"Thanks, matt.",14,,
161,0.97,3239.97,3260.49,"I think the importance of clarity with our partners on developing green jobs as well as the folks that have been advocating for green jobs like John, you have been a part of that work for many years and I think there is a lot of capacity to build these programs and that's another reason to work closely with Osc to get the oversight up and running.",14,,
162,0.97,3260.49,3272.235,There is a specific rule for labor and the community partners to do that policy Visioning and making.,14,,
163,0.97,3272.235,3295.759,"With the expansion and talking about green jobs, solar energy and affordable housing and particularly with strong Union laborers and project agreements are really important parts of the conversation.",14,,
164,0.97,3295.759,3301.731,"There are also green jobs that don't look like construction jobs or utility jobs and you talk about green jobs, we mean the climate and taking care the community.",14,,
165,0.97,3301.731,3323.453,"Healthcare workers and educators and folks that are taking care of kids and bus drivers can all have green jobs and if you are thinking Holistically of what it means to take care of the community and build a better world, let's be thinking about how all of those folks are a part of this story and part of the work to help the future.",14,,
166,0.97,3323.453,3325.388,Thank you so much for listing that out.,15,,
167,0.97,3325.388,3355.719,"I didn't want to give credit as there has been a lot of work in terms of green jobs and to Jesses point, the young leaders committee developed their own term of a green job and that his a lot of things that just mentioned with a job that is good for the community and pays a living wage and it can look like so many different things.",15,,
168,0.97,3355.719,3387.817,"It is so vast and then the other thing I want to mention is that there are local models happening so there is a green Pathway program and it is about placing people of color in organizations and providing a living wage and Ideally, we need more green pathways.",15,,
169,0.97,3387.817,3407.67,I think the city should look into modeling that fellowship program because we know there are folks in the city Department but are also in retirement and that there will be a need for a transition of workers.,15,,
170,0.97,3407.67,3431.394,"So, remembering that there is already a legacy and already a blueprint and it is just a matter of the city Prioritizing and making the investments and looking from the people that are already making it happen.",15,,
171,0.97,3431.394,3434.164,I just want to Piggyback real quick on what everyone else was saying.,16,,
172,0.97,3434.164,3446.91,Part of that relationship when we talk about native communities is also the city being a model that other communities such as surrounding tribal communities have the ability to take the same model and put it into the community.,16,,
173,0.97,3446.91,3454.017,We have the ability to do a lot of this work faster than some of us see in these processes.,16,,
174,0.97,3454.017,3484.314,I think it is also that opportunity of the city being a model for our communities and moving those jobs further out from Seattle and when we think of the fact that there are two federally recognized tribes and that is part of creating those partnerships and the seats at the table to have those conversations so that the work is not just happening here but creating a model.,16,,
175,0.97,3484.314,3484.914,Right.,17,,
176,0.97,3484.914,3500.63,Thank you so much for your comments and I will just make a few closing remarks but only in the spirit that we will be coming back to many of these important discussions.,17,,
177,0.97,3500.63,3503.566,Some of them next year but some of them right away for the budget discussion.,17,,
178,0.97,3503.566,3548.311,"Because we have the Renters rights panel waiting to get on and we have to end the meeting soon because the city councils meeting scheduling restrictions, I just wanted to quickly really reiterate the points that were made in relation to jobs and the need for the environmental movement and climate justice movement and the labor movement to really recognize that this is actually a need to build one movement that is United and organized and all of us face climate change.",17,,
179,0.97,3548.311,3549.412,It doesn't matter who you are.,17,,
180,0.97,3549.412,3594.657,You will be impacted and it is in the interest of the whole movement to be recognized and there are concrete obstacle because often we will see leaders being a part of this process and we need to break that and bring the leadership alongside the movement and the rank-and-file have a big role to play and I think a very important point that was made is that Healthcare workers and educator unions and many of the other unions that may not represent workers in the fossil fuel sector have a big role to draw out the unions into the struggle.,17,,
181,0.97,3594.657,3598.861,I think this is a very concrete thing that we need to do and I'm glad you all mentioned that.,17,,
182,0.97,3598.861,3621.217,I will definitely make sure that our office highlights to our social media and other actions to stop the pipeline which is very important.,17,,
183,0.97,3621.217,3630.994,It is very crucial that the movement is pointing out and not only are we up against a fossil fuel lobby but up against Wall Street because they are financing the climate destruction as you all have said and that is why we need action in the street.,17,,
184,0.97,3630.994,3645.008,Thank you Johnny for reminding us that we are the one year anniversary of the important strike actions and we need the hat by workers themselves shutting down work whether it is the Healthcare Union or fossil fuel workers Union.,17,,
185,0.97,3645.008,3665.228,They will be a key component of shutting down the fossil fuel machine and I just want to highlight that the transit workers unions have a key model to play and the transit workers meaning there is a definite link to the fossil fuel sector as well.,17,,
186,0.97,3665.228,3750.213,"I think all of this is something that we need to keep thinking about and we will be highlighting the protest and we look forward to supporting the budget demands for next week so please keep in touch with our office and we will make sure that the budget movement will push for some concrete gains to the budget and last but not least, we want to follow up on the thing that matt mentioned which is the need to carry out a citywide band on gas and we have some new and commercial buildings and I will say that as you all have said, affordable housing is a big component of reducing climate affects and that is why it is so crucial that the black lives matter movement and the climate justice movement and the affordable housing justice movement will get a victory and while not as big as we are pushing for, it is a huge step forward and the actual affordable homes that will be built are going to be a part of the climate justice victories.",17,,
187,0.97,3750.213,3761.524,They need to keep pushing forward and we will keep following up on these issues.,17,,
188,0.97,3761.524,3784.447,The next is the need to cancel rat rent and for the million statewide letter facing a massive crisis.,17,,
189,0.97,3784.447,3798.494,We have the crises in the pandemic and the massive job and income losses and all that is happening before the Wildfires began.,17,,
190,0.97,3798.494,3823.085,"At the same time, working people and young people have shown the impact we can have by getting organized even in the middle of this pandemic and the Multiracial justice for George Floyd movement already brought millions onto the streets and here, we have affordable Hosing with the justice for George Floyd movement.",17,,
191,0.97,3823.085,3856.219,"That is a victory that belongs to all of the movements and locally and statewide, Renters have Evictions including in Seattle and the panels that will speak our part in organizing what we have done through the Renters rights movement and my office has quoted over 9000 signatures early on.",17,,
192,0.97,3856.219,3902.298,"It was just a few months ago in early March when the pandemic began"" over 9000 signatures to cancel rent and because of that organizing that was not limited to just that but it was statewide and nationwide and not just in Washington state but other States and we also know this is not enough because it nearly delays will be an explosive crisis for a majority of Renters and working people and that includes working and middle-class homeowners and small businesses that are facing this crisis and we know there will be a tsunami of Evictions unless we continue to get organized.",17,,
193,0.97,3902.298,3927.69,I have asked my staff to prepare a presentation that documents the scale and scope of this crisis that we will see in a moment and then we will hear from the panel of Renters and activists about why there is a growing demand and what is really important about this is it is not just a Seattle demand but nationwide.,17,,
194,0.97,3927.69,3933.195,We need this and are in crisis as many people said.,17,,
195,0.97,3933.195,3947.977,"Jonathan, can you go ahead and run the Slideshow for us as we have important Statistics to ground us into why this is a crisis and then we will have our panelists.",17,,
196,0.97,3947.977,3954.583,"Good afternoon, everybody.",18,,
197,0.97,3954.583,3967.096,I am just getting the screen up here if you will bear with me.,18,,
198,0.97,3967.096,3968.03,I am Jonathan.,18,,
199,0.97,3968.03,3968.831,Can everyone hear me?,18,,
200,0.97,3968.831,3977.44,Can you just confirm?,18,,
201,0.97,3977.44,3978.908,"Yes, we can hear you.",19,,
202,0.97,3978.908,3979.208,Great.,20,,
203,0.97,3979.208,4011.24,"We will go through the slides as Councilmember Sawant mentioned reviewing where we are at and we will start by talking about even before Covid in our capital system, nationally, 70% of workers were living paycheck to paycheck in 2017 before the Covid crisis even hit and one half of minimum wage workers had to work more than one job in this country just to make ends meet.",20,,
204,0.97,4011.24,4021.751,These are National Statistics and three out of four said they were in debt and more than half thought they would always be in debt for their entire lives.,20,,
205,0.97,4021.751,4026.655,"Before Covid, three and five Renters cannot talk with $400 in emergency.",20,,
206,0.97,4026.655,4038.801,"In Seattle before Covid, nearly half of Renters were rent burdened in other words, paying more than 30% of their income in rent.",20,,
207,0.97,4038.801,4047.71,"Rent has gone up in the last decade, 69% and more than two times the national average.",20,,
208,0.97,4047.71,4049.078,Before the Covid crisis even started.,20,,
209,0.97,4049.078,4061.223,"The average rent was over $2000 a month meeting that a household would have to have $81,000 a year or more to avoid being rent burdened.",20,,
210,0.97,4061.223,4068.431,More than half of Seattle Renters hit Eviction notices before Covid with month one month's rent or less.,20,,
211,0.97,4068.431,4074.336,This is according to a study done in the Seattle women's Commission.,20,,
212,0.97,4074.336,4086.916,That study also found that nearly nine out of every 10 tenants that were evicted wound up on the streets and is personally women and people of color were those evicted.,20,,
213,0.97,4086.916,4108.137,"Today, we are seeing record unemployment which has peaked but is leveling off at a staggering 1 million new claims of unemployment per week and that is steady at this point with the staggering level to be at.",20,,
214,0.97,4108.137,4109.872,"Today, one third of U. S.",20,,
215,0.97,4109.872,4111.774,Working-class Renters are unable to pay rent on time.,20,,
216,0.97,4111.774,4119.782,That figure has stayed stable since May.,20,,
217,0.97,4119.782,4132.061,Halcyon security is high even when Eviction moratoriums are in place.,20,,
218,0.97,4132.061,4137.433,We know the Seattle city council passed a resolution back in March calling on the state to enact a moratorium and that is in effect until Mid- October.,20,,
219,0.97,4137.433,4146.575,There is a city moratorium until the end of the year but we know that itself does not provide housing stability and I will discuss that more in just a minute.,20,,
220,0.97,4146.575,4147.676,"Today, nearly half of U. S.",20,,
221,0.97,4147.676,4161.624,Renters and one third of Washington state Renters say it is either very likely or somewhat likely that they will be evicted in the next two months according to surveys by the U. S. Census Bureau.,20,,
222,0.97,4161.624,4185.781,"A study was conducted by landlord Association and what they found is that to pay landlord, Renters are spending their savings taking on new debt and burrowing money.",20,,
223,0.97,4187.182,4204.066,"This will be posted on the committee's Website following this meeting if it is not up already but the way you look at this chart, you can see that more than 40% of those that have fallen behind on rent have withdrawn money from personal savings and 40% have borrowed money from family and friends just to pay the bills they needed to.",20,,
224,0.97,4204.066,4230.292,30% have sold assets and 30% of Chelating credit card debt and you will notice at the bottom of the chart and a relatively small number of people have withdrawn money from their retirement accounts and that is because we believe very few working-class people still have substantial retirement accounts to begin with.,20,,
225,0.97,4230.292,4232.394,People are going into greater debt to try to pay rent.,20,,
226,0.97,4232.394,4253.916,"As we have heard, the director of the Kinsey tenants Union in Missouri on the national leader in the Holmes guarantee campaign says every Eviction is an act of violence.",20,,
227,0.97,4253.916,4264.093,Every time we are allowing an Eviction to occur she says we are putting the landlords profits about people's lives.,20,,
228,0.97,4264.093,4282.745,The Covid unemployed crisis is harming communities of color disproportionately and this is data from a couple months ago from the U. S. Department of labor that shows black unemployment is 50% higher than white unemployment and on employment is also higher in Hispanic and Asian communities as well.,20,,
229,0.97,4282.745,4300.262,That crisis is Disproportionally harming communities of color and we can see that Greenies of color are former likely to have unpaid rent as compared to white Renters.,20,,
230,0.97,4300.262,4302.531,Working-class households are so many keep up with even basic expenses.,20,,
231,0.97,4302.531,4320.349,"We can see overall in the United States, over 30% of households reported in the last census survey a couple weeks ago reported difficulty paying for their usual household expenses in the last seven days.",20,,
232,0.97,4320.349,4341.303,"That figure is slightly lower in Washington state with one in every four and will we break it down and look at households that are under $50,000 a year in Washington state, half of those households right now even with the moratoriums in place are having difficulty paying the usual household expenses.",20,,
233,0.97,4341.303,4342.104,Here is the math.,20,,
234,0.97,4342.104,4375.137,"We know there is a major economic crisis that preceded the Covid crisis for working people and on top of that, we have the Covid crisis itself and now we have the moratoriums which are deferred but not forgiven expenses and in the first three factors adding up to a tsunami of Evictions or closures and bankruptcies once the emergency declarations and moratoriums expire.",20,,
235,0.97,4375.137,4392.02,The Aspen Institute which is no friend of working people has just issued a report last month that predicts that different policies locally and around the country estimate that people could be at risk for Eviction in the next several months.,20,,
236,0.97,4392.02,4398.56,Especially as the moratoriums expire.,20,,
237,0.97,4398.56,4420.482,What they found in the state was that a synonymy will be about three quarters of 1 million households at risk of Eviction once an emergency measure expires and that is about one in every three Renter households in the state.,20,,
238,0.97,4420.482,4441.57,Activists and members of the community know that there are stock up measures but they won't solve the mounting debt crisis that workers and Working- class and homeowners face.,20,,
239,0.97,4441.57,4452.614,And Councilmember Sawant mentioned that thousands of people signed this in a short order this past spring.,20,,
240,0.97,4452.614,4460.289,People know that allowing the rent debt to accrue with a moratorium will only ensure that the residence will be economically Destabilized once the moratoriums expire.,20,,
241,0.97,4460.289,4475.137,That is why we are so pleased to be working alongside state and national movements to cancel all rent and mortgages and utilities and late fees and housing debt.,20,,
242,0.97,4475.137,4498.727,We stand in solidarity with the movement that demands that governments pass laws covering all residential Renters that have suffered economically and suspend mortgage payments for homeowners and small landlords and people and affordable housing for those that have suffered economically during the Covid crisis.,20,,
243,0.97,4498.727,4527.489,We know through our experience that people have fought back in recent years and have an important legislation that the Council has passed on limiting winter Evictions and have also blocked Renters for raising rents on Renters where there are safety violations.,20,,
244,0.97,4527.489,4541.904,"In addition, tenants have organized and won housing security at the apartments and we know there are other struggles going on among six tenants and so on.",20,,

257,0.97,4675.404,4683.945,Fundamentally bailing out the landlords.,23,,
258,0.97,4683.945,4700.028,We think they support the bailout which supports essential workers and Renters and small homeowners by not putting the burden on them to qualify and apply for rental assistance as well as continuing to face the threat of Eviction and displacement and foreclosure.,23,,
259,0.97,4700.028,4712.374,We need to support Undocumented Renters that are not eligible for unemployment and are already at a high risk of being threatened by the landlords with I.C.E.,23,,
260,0.97,4712.374,4715.877,"Instead of funneling the tax dollars into violent police forces, we need to invest in social housing.",23,,

265,0.97,4754.082,4765.227,Canceling Brett during this economic and health crisis is a major part but not the end of the fight.,23,,
266,0.97,4765.227,4776.138,The organizing of this campaign has involved folks from across the state and the majority of Washingtonians have fewer rental protections than those of us in Seattle.,23,,

279,0.97,4944.572,4986.948,"As it has been stated, this housing crisis in Seattle and King County as well as across the state has been going on for decades and the Federal Government has invested in public housing and real estate investors like myself growing up in Seattle and the central District have Gentrify that area that you city predominately a black community with lot next communities and Asian communities this pandemic has surely made this crisis in housing more visible and everyone used to argue about what Renters rights were and how we did not need them.",25,,
280,0.97,4986.948,5002.864,"Last year, the fight for just cause, landlords sued the city because they passed in just cause and other protection in that city.",25,,
281,0.97,5002.864,5034.896,"We see the basic need for housing and Renters and low income homeowners are really feeling the burn behind all of what is going on and because of the policies that have excluded black and let next and other communities from homeownership's, they are disproportionately injuring the crisis.",25,,
282,0.97,5034.896,5067.896,We talked about the demands with mortgages and the tenets across the country are working together to bring and uplift the voices and experiences of tenants across the city and the state and the country who are suffering as low income people in this global pandemic.,25,,
283,0.97,5067.896,5099.427,"We have the Union of Washington State and Seattle and we talked to tenants every day who are afraid, literally afraid and some people were alleviated to know that the moratorium was extended to October 15 and August when they were Panicking because they thought they were going to get evicted because they had not paid the rent.",25,,
284,0.97,5099.828,5103.031,Now they are alleviated until October 15 which is a few weeks away and now what?,25,,
285,0.97,5103.031,5107.702,They are holding their breath again to thinking while I get evicted or will I be on the streets?,25,,
286,0.97,5107.702,5121.683,"34% of Renters have not been able to pay rent and that is 243,000 people across the state.",25,,
287,0.97,5121.683,5146.274,"As someone that works in the Travertine community and as we know, many Undocumented workers work in the service entry level which is hotels and restaurants I have not even fully open and some are even only working two or four days a week and some are not getting a check large enough to pay for rent and food and utilities and so what do they have to do?",25,,
288,0.97,5146.274,5164.325,They have jet Compartmentalize and be themselves and then their children and that is when I encourage them to do and document everything in writing with their landlord as to what the situation is because there isn't anything else to do.,25,,
289,0.97,5164.325,5176.137,We don't have any other policies or protections that will protect them from Eviction once the moratorium ends.,25,,
290,0.97,5176.137,5211.039,"I know they have good intentions behind the repayment plan and it makes a tenant feel a little more safe but they will have to borrow money have before this pandemic happened, a rent increase from $50- $100 when the families in dire economic situations and now the repayment plan of $300- $500 a month on top of already high rent of 1500, where will that leave communities?",25,,
291,0.97,5211.039,5215.877,Where will that leave people?,25,,
292,0.97,5215.877,5216.477,In the streets?,25,,
293,0.97,5216.477,5220.148,When we are in the middle of a global pandemic?,25,,
294,0.97,5220.148,5233.595,When we already have a large dire problem of homelessness that we need to address appropriately.,25,,
295,0.97,5233.595,5277.438,"The change in the moratorium in the state allowing landlords to have a 90 day notice was intent to sell or occupy a unit, we have seen these given out like candy in retaliation which is hard to prove but the tenants know it is retaliation and prejudice of them owing the money of back rent and not be able to pay or not being able to find a repayment plan that will fit in people's budget and income.",25,,
296,0.97,5277.438,5285.413,We have seen landlords threaten to call I.C.E.,25,,
297,0.97,5285.413,5295.757,People have to borrow money and they have to make things work.,25,,
298,0.97,5295.757,5305.733,It is interesting what landlords try to do when they think tenants don't know their rights.,25,,
299,0.97,5305.733,5331.492,I think it is important that the city of Seattle lets the landlords now that tenants have the right and to have a campaign to support the Union and those that are out there every day and we are helping people in knowing their rights.,25,,
300,0.97,5331.492,5351.612,So that the landlords can no they are Messing with people who are informed of their rights because their demeanor completely changes once the tenant feels empowered and stands up for themselves.,25,,
301,0.97,5351.612,5362.623,This loophole with the 90 day loophole needs to be addressed because people are still getting evicted because of it.,25,,
302,0.97,5362.623,5380.808,We need to really get together and center what the human rights and tenant rights are to be into a safe hold because that will protect us from so many other things in the future.,25,,
303,0.97,5380.808,5396.29,So many other social problems and we need to look at the budget for the city and invest in community and black indigenous Travertine people of color communities.,25,,
304,0.97,5396.29,5396.924,Thank you very much.,25,,
305,0.97,5396.924,5419.08,I think the city of Seattle has been a model and a leader in policies and protections for tenants that other parts of the state Hae looked up to with the city of Seattle and implementing just cause.,25,,
306,0.97,5419.08,5426.254,"So, thank you very much and I do hope that you stand with us in our fight for the debt canceled Evictions.",25,,

310,0.97,5434.662,5439.767,We know the rent crisis also affects small businesses that too often are at the mercy of big corporate landlords.,26,,
311,0.97,5439.767,5461.489,We need to cancel rent for struggling small businesses and we know many businesses have already faced a struggle and that really highlights the move to band together and stand with one another.,26,,
312,0.97,5461.489,5466.794,Jenny Henderson will share some of her thoughts with us.,26,,
313,0.97,5466.794,5467.061,Welcome.,26,,

315,0.97,5473.534,5477.438,This is an important fight to cancel rent.,27,,
316,0.97,5477.438,5486.747,My name is Shirley Henderson.,27,,
317,0.97,5486.747,5494.255,I have a coffee shop and hair salon in the central district and it is an epicenter of jet vacation in Seattle.,27,,
318,0.97,5494.255,5502.763,I'm here to speak to the struggle of the city during this pandemic.,27,,
319,0.97,5502.763,5519.747,Jonathan and other panelists have laid out already that Covid-19 has given a devastating blow to the dishes and people across the country.,27,,
320,0.97,5519.747,5532.593,"Local gatherings and Mom-And- pop shops have really suffered and as others have pointed out, like most cities, Seattle was already suffering with income Inequalty before the pandemic.",27,,
321,0.97,5532.593,5541.002,We were already facing a historic housing crisis with skyrocketing rents.,27,,
322,0.97,5541.002,5554.715,"Now, with Covid-19, we see thousands of workers and so many businesses having to close their doors and especially during the beginning of the pandemic.",27,,
323,0.97,5554.715,5585.446,"This includes the fitness center which was forced to close and for us, we had to lay off all staff as well but were able to continue to operate the coffee shop during the Lockdown and this means that the owners have to work Doubletime while ensuring that there are safety measures in place.",27,,
324,0.97,5585.446,5594.956,"With unemployment not readily available, we also had to scramble to pay for staff to get information from customers.",27,,
325,0.97,5594.956,5610.371,So many small businesses are facing things right now and we do not have the vast resources of big businesses nor have we received all the kickbacks and bailouts.,27,,
326,0.97,5610.371,5616.644,There is a prediction of two thirds to 80% of small businesses nationwide not surviving.,27,,
327,0.97,5616.644,5626.587,We know the businesses that are most honorable and will be most impacted are people of color and female owned people.,27,,
328,0.97,5626.587,5667.228,"Many of us are also Renters and we are struggling with two rents while trying to juggle keeping staff and customer safe during a pandemic and I have heard from a lot of other small businesses that landlords have been unwilling to forgive rent or in some cases, the landlord is willing to do an abatement which is a way to kick the can down the road so that when the economy gets worse, small businesses will be left to pay more rent to catch up which is not feasible when if you have little to no income.",27,,
329,0.97,5667.228,5686.647,"This is very tied to the interest of our employees and as mentioned, many of the employees that are already struggling are hit even harder and being furloughed or laid off with the uncertainty of even being able to return to work.",27,,
330,0.97,5686.647,5695.956,When the moratorium ends which will leave many in fear of losing their housing.,27,,
331,0.97,5695.956,5720.081,"Meanwhile, we see banks getting bailed out and many like Amazon . Let's be clear, there is a dynamic wealth accumulation that is stripping away the public sector including Healthcare and social housing which is created and exacerbated with this crisis.",27,,
332,0.97,5720.081,5730.658,"Now, working people just like 2007 and 2008 are being asked to bear the brunt.",27,,
333,0.97,5730.658,5743.904,Those I have profited over this should afford to pay for it.,27,,
334,0.97,5745.372,5750.377,The city council is looking at the fabric of the city and they must help the working people and small owners and small businesses.,27,,
335,0.97,5750.377,5758.119,We cannot give a bailout to corporate landlords.,27,,
336,0.97,5758.119,5770.097,We need to cancel this because they can Embed the cost.,27,,
337,0.97,5770.097,5776.07,We stand in solidarity with those that are here on the panel and the workers across the city that are struggling to make rent.,27,,
338,0.97,5776.07,5795.156,"Again, a huge thank you to Councilmember Sawant and her office for pushing this forward and for always fighting tirelessly for the interests of working people and small businesses and thank you for making City Hall truly a public space.",27,,

340,0.97,5795.956,5797.424,"Thank you very much, Shirley.",28,,
341,0.97,5797.424,5804.732,Next we have Jason Redmond who is one of the growing number of activists in Seattle.,28,,
342,0.97,5804.732,5813.14,He is a part of one of the biggest volunteering corporate landlords in Seattle.,28,,
343,0.97,5813.14,5824.351,"They have gained reliability so welcome, Jason.",28,,
344,0.97,5824.351,5848.609,Thank you for having me . I am a self-employed employee and in district 6 and I would like to speak with assisted Renters and small business owners and independent landlords.,29,,
345,0.97,5848.609,5863.023,"Late last year, the private landlords retired after 40 years and sold our building.",29,,
346,0.97,5863.39,5868.128,The new owners never introduced themselves and remain complete anonymous and probably because what they were about to do to me and my neighbors.,29,,
347,0.97,5868.128,5898.125,"The new owners hired a company that managed 5500 units in Seattle to handle all aspects of our building and after some research, our building had been purchased by local business owners and the article mentioned that the owners sell their billing for nearly $30 million and were investing properties like my apartment building.",29,,
348,0.97,5898.125,5945.939,"Not long after, we received notices that rent was increasing and some like myself are receiving almost a 40% increase that took effect on Fairbury first and as you all know, the case of Coronavirus in our country it was here when was meant to the hospital in January 1. when I go to Cornell and Associates about the excess rent, I could not get a quick response and when I was able to speak to the person, they assured me that they had done research on rents in my area and they suggested that they could increase even higher than they did to almost a 60% increase.",29,,
349,0.97,5945.939,5955.716,This is the same company that according to a recent article is trying to Vixen tenants with black lives matter signs in the window.,29,,
350,0.97,5955.716,5981.909,"As the pandemic grew, I reach out again to Cornell and Associates to inquire about the original amount to help save the crisis and we asked our parents for money or put rent on a credit card and they have kept himself busy.",29,,
351,0.97,5981.909,5988.248,And they are sitting to other parts of the country.,29,,
352,0.97,5988.248,5999.159,And this comes from local initial conferences and I'm extremely worried about my future and the ability to pay my inflated rent.,29,,
353,0.97,5999.159,6013.574,"And we have protections in place and unless we start acting now, there might be massive Evictions.",29,,
354,0.97,6013.574,6028.255,I'm worried about the working class families and Renters and homeowners and the people of color and self-employed people like myself and others whose jobs have been affected by the pandemic.,29,,
355,0.97,6028.255,6032.092,We need to keep putting pressure on our State and local leaders and help those that need it most.,29,,
356,0.97,6032.092,6046.507,We need to ask for statewide rent control and continued assistance like cancer rent and mortgage for those of us that have lost jobs or significant income due to the pandemic.,29,,

358,0.97,6050.778,6054.815,"Thanks so much, Jason.",30,,
359,0.97,6054.815,6066.226,Now we have a tenant activist leader.,30,,
360,0.97,6066.226,6072.699,"Last year, the neighbors are mostly senior citizens organized and ran a rent freeze at a nonprofit organization.",30,,
361,0.97,6072.699,6091.151,This was important not just for the tenants but it inspiration for all of us fighting the displacement especially from black and Brown communities.,30,,
362,0.97,6126.22,6140.1,"I want to thank everyone that has helped us to maintain a rent freeze and since that time, we have accomplished a lot here and we have a new imprisonment of the board.",31,,
363,0.97,6140.1,6150.744,There have been changes made and we have problems with gun violence through the parking lot and different things and Johnson has been wonderful.,31,,

372,0.97,6256.316,6269.696,Nobody is really talking and they're making changes was a one-time fee for the parking space.,34,,
373,0.97,6269.696,6290.117,"And we have the car insurance and things we've never had to do before but we will keep in touch and like I said, so far, everything has been wonderful and they have worked with us if you couldn't pay rent and everything is going good so far.",34,,

377,0.97,6301.461,6311.938,"So far, everything is good.",36,,
378,0.97,6314.841,6319.146,We are looking for a big change but we just don't know what it is because they are not telling us.,36,,
379,0.97,6319.146,6319.646,"Right, absolutely.",37,,
380,0.97,6319.646,6321.782,I think that is an important point that you may.,37,,
381,0.97,6321.782,6329.523,Working people and Renters in our communities fight for something and it is never a guarantee that it will stay the same.,37,,
382,0.97,6329.523,6335.562,You and your fellow Renters have the right to be vigilant about that and we will follow up as well.,37,,
383,0.97,6335.562,6339.466,Thank you so much.,38,,
384,0.97,6339.466,6342.803,Stay on the line just in case we have a few minutes.,39,,
385,0.97,6342.803,6346.106,"Okay, I sure well.",40,,
386,0.97,6346.106,6360.721,Now we have Sharon Crowley who is an Organizer with the Union of academic employees and the University of Washington.,41,,
387,0.97,6360.721,6385.645,Many members struggle in the heart of the city and being dominated by landlords and the students have been organizing and fighting back and the Union has played a leading role in the fight to stop Evictions in the union's members also play a leading role with the Amazon tax as well.,41,,
388,0.97,6385.645,6386.079,"Welcome, Sharon.",41,,
389,0.97,6386.079,6387.147,"Hi, thank you so much.",42,,
390,0.97,6387.147,6399.359,My name is Sharon Crowley and I Organizer and member of the local 4121.,42,,
391,0.97,6399.359,6401.161,Thank you so much for inviting me to speak today.,42,,
392,0.97,6401.161,6404.498,Our Union includes over 6000 undergraduates and Postop academic workers.,42,,
393,0.97,6404.498,6409.236,The work we do is central to the research mission.,42,,
394,0.97,6409.236,6419.446,"As we have heard today, this Pndemic is having wide consequences with record unemployment and widespread budgeting.",42,,
395,0.97,6419.446,6438.398,"Our members have seen like any other large employer, they will pass this on to the most honorable workers and that includes our members and most of whom are on six term appointments and some are even having to find positions quarter by quarter.",42,,
396,0.97,6438.398,6445.672,"Right now, this means increased uncertainty about whether appointments will be renewed for another year or another quarter.",42,,
397,0.97,6445.672,6452.112,Many members are ineligible to receive the financial aid that is available.,42,,
398,0.97,6452.112,6455.882,Like unemployment and other things.,42,,
399,0.97,6455.882,6463.089,It is it even harder for the 40% that are International and their Visas don't allow them to work anywhere else.,42,,
400,0.97,6463.089,6469.896,"If they lose an appointment, they are stuck between a rock and a hard place.",42,,
401,0.97,6469.896,6484.244,All of our members upon graduation or complete of a term faced the job market was unprecedented levels of unemployment and increased scarcity of the research and teaching jobs that are central to the career.,42,,
402,0.97,6484.244,6499.259,"Meanwhile, they are doing research with Covid-19 practices and possible treatments and the housing crisis that we all face.",42,,
403,0.97,6499.259,6510.971,"While also facing the housing crisis themselves and even before Covid-19, the crisis has been hitting our members hard for years.",42,,
404,0.97,6510.971,6530.957,"Like Shawna indicated, at the same time, housing in the District which is where the majority of our members tried to live, it is been taken over by predatory corporations that are looking to profit on the backs of students by charging rent for my compartments and not safe conditions.",42,,
405,0.97,6530.957,6544.004,This is a huge problem and over 80% of our members are rent burdened with many paying over 50% of their income in rent.,42,,
406,0.97,6544.004,6564.291,"Long before the pandemic struck, we already needed affordable housing options and many members have to either stretch their income to cover 12 months of expenses or try to find another job during the summer which is a very challenging prospect during the pandemic.",42,,
407,0.97,6564.291,6573.199,Covid-19 has increased the severity of our need for affordable housing while also increasing vulnerability we face on multiple fronts.,42,,
408,0.97,6573.199,6582.809,Our Workgroup has been focusing our efforts on campaigns to increase housing Affordability and accessibility in Seattle.,42,,
409,0.97,6582.809,6600.794,These are improvements that our members greatly need and the city Council to take a huge step towards achieving these goals I passing a business tax in July and the moratorium on elections in Washington has also been helpful to a lot of people.,42,,
410,0.97,6600.794,6609.569,"However, it has done nothing to alleviate the huge burden of months work of back rent that people that are out of work are facing as soon as the moratorium is lifted.",42,,
411,0.97,6609.569,6613.373,This is an economic and human rights disaster in the making.,42,,
412,0.97,6613.373,6628.688,Working people have a bearing the burden for way too long and Covid has only intensified that issue.,42,,
413,0.97,6628.688,6651.144,Many were on the verge of the Eviction even before the pandemic hit and I had a friend that had to break her lease and move in with a friend because her landlord would not reduce her rent and it was not honoring the moratorium and she also knew she would face this huge debt on the other end as things were and she did not want to have to keenly any more debt.,42,,
414,0.97,6651.144,6668.328,We all know these burdens fall heaviest on the most Foldable and that includes people that have already been doing with the displacement in Seattle because of Gentrification throughout our city.,42,,
415,0.97,6668.328,6682.142,We have long been committed to fighting for economic housing and climate justice and ensure a green new deal with the most active working groups dedicated to these issues.,42,,
416,0.97,6682.142,6695.355,"Right now, canceling rent and mortgages is a critical part of achieving this justice.",42,,
417,0.97,6695.722,6703.363,The people of Seattle need this relief along with other direct financial assistance in order to survive the pandemic without facing Evictions or Impoverishment.,42,,
418,0.97,6703.363,6716.776,We cannot keep showing the cost of capitalism lobby businesses receive bailouts and record profits and further enrich the board of directors.,42,,
419,0.97,6716.776,6719.312,"Meanwhile, I have paid nothing with the court costs associated.",42,,
420,0.97,6719.312,6736.096,"From urging the city Council and the state of Washington, we need to take meaningful action by acting the progressive policy and revenue stream we need and now is not the time for prosperity budgeting but where we have to be bold and take progressive action.",42,,
421,0.97,6736.096,6736.396,Thank you.,42,,
422,0.97,6736.396,6750.51,Thank you so much and I want to thank both panels for allowing us to have such a rich discussion and keeping your comments so brief because we are so short on time.,43,,
423,0.97,6750.51,6768.828,"I quickly want to invite my fellow Councilmembers, Pederson or Lewis, if you have any questions and even though we don't have much time for discussion, I wanted to know if you have any questions or comments to make.",43,,
424,0.97,6768.828,6771.931,You are on mute.,43,,
425,0.97,6771.931,6775.735,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,44,,
426,0.97,6775.735,6776.736,I do not have any questions.,44,,
427,0.97,6776.736,6782.208,Thank you.,44,,
428,0.97,6782.208,6785.111,"Madam chair, I was on it as well apparently.",45,,
429,0.97,6785.111,6786.246,This is counsel number Lewis.,45,,
430,0.97,6786.246,6788.748,That expands a lot.,45,,
431,0.97,6788.748,6791.351,"In any event, I don't have any questions for the panel.",45,,
432,0.97,6791.351,6870.73,"I just want to reiterate that as one of the two Renters on the Council, this is something I care very deeply about and not just the need to make sure that the economic pressures are not meaning the folks getting kicked out of their homes but we have a cool way to make sure people are staying housed and that we make sure that the pressure from landlords as alluded to earlier with people being able to use their first amendment rights and having that preemptive with the black Limes matter signs, I think this counsel should take that up and I know my lease on reviewing it again recently has the prohibition on that that is so strict that I would not even be able to put a campaign sign for myself and my window, technically although I don't know if my landlord would strictly enforce that but there is so much work we need you to make sure tenants are treated fairly and with dignity and I look forward to the next steps so thank you.",45,,
433,0.97,6870.73,6873.099,Thank you for those comments.,46,,
434,0.97,6873.099,6876.903,I totally agree.,46,,
435,0.97,6876.903,6939.299,"That is just a gross violation of Renter rights to have even that kind of political Signage and I know when I was a Renter, I knew the landlord would not allow to have anything political and that is a violation seeing how both Renters in the residential apartments and workers and workplaces are now being cracked down on for displaying by finds matter Signage and we just had one more worker fired and I don't think in Seattle but nationwide, dozens of workers are getting fired because they are wearing cough masks that say by finds matter so this is an opportunity for Renters and workers in many of whom are the same people to fight this against landlords and employing corporations that create the situation where they can't even express themselves to that degree.",46,,
436,0.97,6939.299,6949.409,The city council should be following up on this and the Renters rights committee and we will be following up on that.,46,,
437,0.97,6949.409,7029.789,"I want to honor the city clerk's requirement that we end no later than 1:00 but just in closing I want to say that we talked about the need to organize Renters and the important point was made that the demeanor completely changes when they see a Renter that is familiar with their own rights and that is why I want to announce on October 13th which is Tuesday at 7 PM, we will have an Online tenets right boot camp that my office is Cohosting so please make sure you join us on Tuesday at 7 PM for the camp and we will share that link on social media and we also will be in touch with the community and the community members leaders on the next steps for how we can have different points to bring up and with the city council can pass in the next few weeks and following up with 10 associations for the Renters as Jason was sharing so that would make sure the city council supports the struggles as well.",46,,
438,0.97,7029.789,7038.364,I want to thank you all once again and I really appreciate the rich discussion and we will keep in touch.,46,,
439,0.97,7038.364,7040.166,I will end the meeting.,46,,
440,0.97,7040.166,7040.733,Thank you.,46,,
