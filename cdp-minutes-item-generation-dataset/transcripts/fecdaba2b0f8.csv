34,0.97,150.216,197.13,"In addition, the standing committees will not hold the regular meetings according to the Council rules approved last year, so I am sending this memo out because I think it is important for us to confirm that the Council summer Recess is still in effect and consistent with the Council rules and I know that we are all working remotely and so things seem a little in flux and out of the ordinary and we want to make sure that folks know that the Recess is still in place and that we will work our operations and our legislative efforts around that previously approved and on the books summer Recess.",18,,

59,0.97,410.209,431.13,"You recall we worked on this--we have been working on this for the last couple of years the Monorail, owned by the city and operated by a Concessioner has the capacity, and we're hoping to achieve maximum capacity to transport 6,000 riders in each direction of travel.",19,,
60,0.97,431.13,432.565,"Conceptionally, that is the goal there.",19,,

85,0.97,589.989,591.791,I would appreciate that.,22,,
86,0.97,591.791,591.991,Okay.,22,,
87,0.97,591.991,594.026,"Next up is Councilmember Lewis, please.",22,,
88,0.97,594.026,594.794,"Thank you, Madam President.",23,,
89,0.97,594.794,602.568,I will try to move quickly through a number of updates this morning.,23,,
90,0.97,602.568,612.411,"First, I want to thank you, Council president and your office for working with my office to get the personal guarantee suspension legislation on introduction and referral on for today.",23,,
91,0.97,612.411,615.715,I had Inextended to walk that bill on last week.,23,,
92,0.97,615.715,624.857,"I think that the way we did finally resolve that worked out fine, so it is on introduction referral today.",23,,
93,0.97,624.857,663.396,"Just as a bit of background to just get us all up to speed on that bill again, this was a proposal that was brought from consultation with a number of small business owners in my district who have experienced essentially being shaken down by commercial landlords for their rent, despite the moratoriums and other regulations on that and then essentially threatened with invoking a personal guarantee clause in the lease meaning the landlords could go after the home, personal savings or personal assets of the small business owner as collateral for the rent.",23,,
94,0.97,663.396,707.673,"A number of other jurisdictions, New York, and some cities in California, and I think even the state of California, is discussing similar legislation around suspending these personal guarantee clauses until the end of the Covid outbreak and state I think that it is only fair to do so given that the small business owner may sign up knowing that many small businesses fail to lose everything in the business enterprise they're putting together, but no one anticipated that there would be this massive pandemic and accompanying massive economic collapse that puts at risk not only losing the business but losing all of your personal assets as well.",23,,
95,0.97,707.673,722.855,I don't think anyone signed up for that and I think it is only fair that the enforcement of the clauses be suspended so that small business owners and Non-Profits are not facing the prospect of losing everything in addition to their business.,23,,
96,0.97,722.855,730.129,I like forward to discussing that over the course of the next week.,23,,
97,0.97,730.129,745.978,"Second, I just want to address that last week I had a really good opportunity with community members demonstrating for the goals of Decriminalize Seattle outside the queen Ann farmer's market.",23,,
98,0.97,745.978,756.989,I stayed a little bit after the demonstration to talk to some folks and we had really great conversations about how to move forward and meet those goals.,23,,
99,0.97,756.989,763.295,I do proudly support those goals including a reduction in the budget.,23,,
100,0.97,763.295,767.166,I did also say that I want to work with --,23,,
101,0.97,767.166,770.136,"Councilmember Lewis, I'm sorry to interrupt you.",24,,
102,0.97,770.136,782.815,"If you are not speaking and you are not on mute, I would ask for you to please mute yourself because we're hearing some Ambient noise in the background during Councilmember Lewis' report.",24,,
103,0.97,782.815,800.733,"If you're not actively speaking or presenting, I would ask that you please mute yourself or I ask that the Tech Department please mute those users so that we can minimize the interruption and distraction from the reports.",24,,
104,0.97,800.733,803.135,"I apologize for that, Councilmember Lewis, please.",24,,
105,0.97,803.135,810.442,"Thank you you, Madam President.",25,,
106,0.97,810.442,817.85,"I appreciate your maintaining the decorum of the Online meeting, so thank you.",25,,
107,0.97,817.85,833.799,"As I was saying about the 50% cut, I do think that we, and I know this is the intention of everyone on this Council to work together throughout this summer session and the fall session to craft a plan to meet the goals, including the goal of the 50% cut.",25,,
108,0.97,833.799,844.076,I want to share at a high level three strategies that could be Instructionive to work with the community and work as a Council to realize a plan to realize the goals.,25,,
109,0.97,844.076,875.407,"I think the first strategy, as we heard from our panel last Wednesday is reallocation of certain civilian services to other departments or even independent agencies outside of Department . of the police indeed, I was pleased to see a letter this morning that was circulated to all of us that the executive is apparently intending to transfer $76 million worth of functions outside of the sworn chain of command and into civilian control.",25,,
110,0.97,875.407,885.284,"That includes the 911 dispatch, which is a specifically delineated, independent recommendation of Decriminalize Seattle.",25,,
111,0.97,885.284,891.89,"It includes parking enforcement, the office of emergency management, and the office of professional accountability.",25,,
112,0.97,891.89,929.528,"All civilian agencies that should not be under the sworn chain of command and should be completely independent or in more appropriate departments, I do think that is an essential core, one of the three strategies that I have sort of identified as wanting to focus on because I do think it makes a difference in terms of the culture and in terms of the mission of some of the services that they be separated out from a sworn chain of command and be put into more appropriate departments and offices or even made independent with the change focus and a changed leadership.",25,,
113,0.97,929.528,945.077,I think that is a key component and I applaud the executive for taking the initiative this morning in signalling that they are willing to make those reductions and to make the transfers.,25,,
114,0.97,945.077,957.856,I think the second strategy is the right SIZING of first response and I think we have done a lot of work already as a Council on this in terms of identifying that over half of 911 calls are noncriminal in nature.,25,,
115,0.97,957.856,964.496,Those 911 calls could be better served by a different class of first Responder.,25,,
116,0.97,964.496,976.742,I talked last during briefing last week about the possibility of a Cahootst style response.,25,,
117,0.97,976.742,992.825,"I think a transition from current functions served by cornucopia of first Responset alternates, transferred by an independent 911 dispatch is a core part of the strategy.",25,,
118,0.97,992.825,1012.811,"I would call that a right SIZING of first response and I think that that is a core part of how we realize a 50% cut goal in reallocation from sworn officers to new alternate, public health and harm reduction first Responder services.",25,,
119,0.97,1012.811,1042.307,The third strategy is long overdue investment and Scaling up of investment and so we're doing critical Anti-Violence and community building work in the city that mitigate the existing case load of what we have SPD responding to and build strong communities and long-term resilience that cuts down on the need for the type of service that has been provided by sworn SPD officers.,25,,
120,0.97,1042.307,1048.947,"I think that, you know, all of us on this Council have worked with organizations doing this critical work.",25,,
121,0.97,1048.947,1062.995,We have seen proof of concept in how effective the work they have been doing has been and I think that there is a strong opportunity in the Scaling up and expansion of those services to make real long-term progress on public safety.,25,,
122,0.97,1062.995,1085.684,"So I was just sharing the broad--I know our time is limited today but I think the broad three strategies are places we can really look to start making progress and putting together during the summer session a plan, I look forward to working with everyone on this Council to make that a reality and truly honor our Charter obligation to provide public safety to the city in a way that it is evident.",25,,
123,0.97,1085.684,1097.696,"We Prankly have not been doing, based on the mismatch of 911 requests for assistance and the services we have been providing which have not been tailored to that response.",25,,
124,0.97,1097.696,1104.403,So I look forward to continuing to formulate that plan with everyone here and with members of the community.,25,,
125,0.97,1104.403,1127.459,"My last update, I'll be brief on this, on the King County regional homelessness Committee, I have been Deputyized by the Council President, providing an update on who the nominees as a Council will be for the implementation board of the King County regional homelessness authority.",25,,
126,0.97,1127.459,1133.799,Board advises the governing committee which Council President Gonzalez and I serve on.,25,,
127,0.97,1133.799,1143.375,Every sort of caucus on the regional homelessness authority gets to nominate a few members to the implementation board.,25,,
128,0.97,1143.375,1151.183,So I just want to briefly share the Bios of the two members and then I'll close out my report.,25,,
129,0.97,1151.183,1159.825,I want to thank the Council President's office for--we're working effectively with my staff in coming to an agreement on the two members.,25,,
130,0.97,1159.825,1174.473,I think we have two great nominees and they will serve the work of the regional authority really well.,25,,
131,0.97,1174.473,1178.544,So first is Paula Carvalho.,25,,
132,0.97,1178.544,1192.257,"A graduate of MIT and works at the foundation as a program officer on the youth homelessness strategy there, which is a critical strategy in Seattle.",25,,
133,0.97,1192.257,1196.895,"Prior to joining the foundation, she was the director at the Mockingbird society.",25,,
134,0.97,1196.895,1205.337,"In the role, over saw State-Wide programming with the duel focus on youth development and systems perform.",25,,
135,0.97,1205.337,1221.019,"She initiated and shared the racial equity committee until her departure from that previous board before joining or rather before working at Mockingbird, she was an independent case manager for the YMCA greater Seattle.",25,,
136,0.97,1221.019,1239.071,"She has a great wealth of experience, has a master's degree in teaching from Seattle University, will make an excellent partner in making regional progress on chronic homelessness.",25,,
137,0.97,1239.071,1260.158,Our second point is Dr. Reddy who worked in the field of homeless health since completing an internal medicine Resideny and brings a unique perspective from a lot of the other folks from a primary care physician.,25,,
138,0.97,1260.158,1266.265,Primary health is a massive scope of work for the regional authority.,25,,
139,0.97,1266.265,1288.253,"Really looking forward to having Dr. Reddy serve on the regional body, the implementation body as well, and really looking forward to advocating later this month for both of these nominees and then hearing from the other members of the regional Committee on who they are putting forward to serve on it as well.",25,,
140,0.97,1288.253,1294.059,"With that, I can take any questions on the report today.",25,,
141,0.97,1294.059,1300.032,"Otherwise, I am happy to yield it back over to Council President.",25,,
142,0.97,1300.032,1325.49,"Councilmember Lewis, before we conclude this section of the report, and thank you for taking the lead on providing the full council with updates on the King County regional homeless authority, implementation board appointment process, I wanted to provide an opportunity to Jeff Sims from the Council central staff who is back from parental leave.",26,,
143,0.97,1325.49,1333.865,"Welcome back, Jeff, from parental leave, and welcome back to being able to provide us a little bit more detail on this particular appointment process.",26,,
144,0.97,1333.865,1365.764,"I did want to give Jeff an opportunity, since we asked him to be on the call this morning, an opportunity to just quickly brief Councilmembers and the public on what the implementation board appointment process was that led to the identification of Paula Carvalho and Dr. Reddy as the Council's Seattle city council's recommended appointments to the implementation board.",26,,
145,0.97,1365.764,1376.875,"So, Jeff, I see that you are off mute and want to hand it over to you to walk us through quickly what that implementation board process was and we'll take questions and comments from colleagues.",26,,

182,0.97,1723.755,1741.039,This is due to some Federal action that was taken several years ago so the resolution calls for state assist in identifying policy solutions that can really provide better support to these organizations and I can share a little bit more about that this afternoon.,29,,

192,0.97,1824.656,1848.58,"I'm reminded that about a year ago or so, they actually had to vacate the office because of somebody showing up with a gun and so you know, these are employees who have dedicated their careers to advancing the civil rights of people in the city of Seattle.",30,,
193,0.97,1848.58,1874.539,"They do so at great sacrifice and under a tremendous amount of pressure to deliver results on behalf of the residents of Seattle, but also are held to the duty of holding us all accountable to the obligations to comply with and implement the principles around the race and social justice initiative that includes in House training.",30,,
194,0.97,1874.539,1945.777,"It includes making sure that we are leading with race in terms of how we process policies and how we look at the work that we do as government in the space and so, you know, the fact that they're being so openly attacked for following through of on their mandate around the race and social justice initiative is absolutely unacceptable and really appreciate that you, as chair of the committee that oversees OCR is making time to address the particular concerns publicly because they do think it is important and I hope they hear your remarks and any other remarks Councilmembers make in support of the ongoing commitment, not just to do enforcement and investigation of our civil rights law as it relates to Seattle residents at large but also the work that they do tirelessly and often times with not enough resources and not enough support to advance the principles of the race and social justice initiative which is part of their mandate as a executive Department.",30,,
195,0.97,1945.777,1953.084,Really appreciate you taking the time to acknowledge them this morning.,30,,

284,0.97,2603.968,2604.835,Okay.,35,,
285,0.97,2604.835,2610.007,"And I'll just up with this, Coucil President, there are three things I would like to flag for folks.",35,,
286,0.97,2610.007,2617.147,"Number one, there will be a substitute bill that will send around that reflects a number of the changes you all have identified here.",35,,
287,0.97,2617.147,2620.417,Public discussion and some key amendments that you flag for central staff.,35,,
288,0.97,2620.417,2639.403,"We tried as much as possible, if it was really stream lining the conversations and noncontroversial to try to reflect as many so there was an easier process for us to deliberate a few of the changes made.",35,,
289,0.97,2639.403,2643.974,We have also included a few really important issues we have planned for folks early.,35,,
290,0.97,2643.974,2649.58,I flagged for you early we were interested in clarifying language around child care entities.,35,,
291,0.97,2649.58,2659.289,One of the amendments we see reflected in the substitute bill going around so that entities don't currently have to be contracting with the city to apply for or receive benefits from the spending plan.,35,,
292,0.97,2659.289,2669.166,I'm happy to address any questions and I know alley and Tracy will as well in any of the substitute language you see coming toward you.,35,,
293,0.97,2669.166,2672.236,It will also be accompanied by a memo.,35,,
294,0.97,2672.236,2694.191,"Also want to flag for folks having ongoing conversations right now for folks, both on Council and in community about adding language related to green new deal priorities and affordable housing and historically Disinvested communities, communities that have faced high rates of displacement and Gentrification including in black and Brown communities.",35,,
295,0.97,2694.191,2697.294,A lot of the work is on right now.,35,,
296,0.97,2697.294,2709.273,We're excited about the recommendations that have come forward for both members and community partners and we are looking at strengthening some of the language with your support.,35,,
297,0.97,2709.273,2737.668,"I believe we'll have a really great balance of, including language to shore up or invest in communities, emphasizing amendment language on climate resilience and transitions from fossil fuels, assistance with energy, low income home owners in Seattle, particularly those who are already experiencing pressure such as communities of color and those in, throughout Seattle.",35,,
298,0.97,2737.668,2758.689,"We're also working with our partners in labor to make sure that we continue to emphasize that jobs created through the investments are good jobs, Union jobs and creating pathways forward for local communities of color to access the jobs and that includes also strengthening some of the language that we have been working on related to affordable housing investments.",35,,
299,0.97,2758.689,2771.135,"Just wanted to flag those three efforts, substitute additional language on green new deal and housing, necessarily in areas impacted by institutionalized racism and past discriminatory practices.",35,,
300,0.97,2771.135,2779.309,So we'll send out more information very soon on that.,35,,
301,0.97,2779.309,2780.911,"Awesome, thank you so much.",36,,
302,0.97,2780.911,2786.283,Any questions or comments on that report?,36,,

312,0.97,2845.943,2851.782,There is an amendment clarifying that Dr. Granderson is a new appointment.,37,,
313,0.97,2851.782,2866.029,Dr. Dranderson is so dedicated to the technology field he has been attending the Meetdings to observe he is practically already a member but the memo will clarify it is officially a new appointment.,37,,
314,0.97,2866.029,2869.8,"Resolution 30950 mentioned by Councilmember Juarez, thrilled to support that today.",37,,
315,0.97,2869.8,2884.314,"In addition to the three parks and other parts of Seattle, this resolution includes two important parks in distribute four at the Southern end of distribute four at Terry Pettis park in East Lake and northeastern end of distribute 4 at the play area.",37,,
316,0.97,2884.314,2891.221,"There are over 1,000 low income families who call the park home and renovating this area is very important.",37,,
317,0.97,2891.221,2896.326,This resolution enables us to seek matching funds for all of the parks.,37,,
318,0.97,2896.326,2902.099,"On the introduction and referral calendar today, we have Council bill 119833.",37,,

324,0.97,2930.427,2944.074,"Based on public comment at that meeting last week, I am interested in an amendment to the Mayor's proposal to allow a shift of some of the Roadwork dollars to create more transit hours.",37,,

328,0.97,2965.362,2969.399,Any questions or comments on that report?,38,,
329,0.97,2969.399,2970.167,Seeing none.,38,,
330,0.97,2970.167,2975.272,We'll move onto the next Councilmember.,38,,
331,0.97,2975.272,2976.573,That is Councilmember Sawant.,38,,
332,0.97,2976.573,2976.807,Please.,38,,
333,0.97,2976.807,2985.282,"Thank you, good morning, everyone, there are no items on the city council agenda for the Sustainability and Renter's rights committee.",39,,
334,0.97,2985.282,2992.422,The committee meeting is scheduled for July 28th will be cancelled due to the city budget deliberations.,39,,
335,0.97,2992.422,3000.464,I have been extremely proud to have worked in the last few weeks with senior clergy from the black community as they have advanced the central area housing plan.,39,,
336,0.97,3000.464,3016.98,The centerpiece of which is a demand for the city to commit to housing new affordable homes in the central district to begin to reverse racist Gentrification funded by part of the Amazon tax and our movement was able to win last week.,39,,
337,0.97,3016.98,3048.278,"They sent a letter June 2ND to the Mayor and all city council members that outlines the set of demands and I just wanted to share with members the public who are watching that I will be putting forward an amendment this Wednesday in our discussions on the Amazon tax, what we call a spending plan, to dedicate $50 million per year toward this vitally necessary work and I would really welcome any Council members to join with me and the community in putting real dollars behind the slogan of black lives matter.",39,,
338,0.97,3048.278,3066.196,The amendment will make clear that we need to designate dollars to this work of focusing affordable housing construction for working class communities of color such as the black community that have been decimated by Gentrification over the last years and decades.,39,,
339,0.97,3066.196,3089.286,"We need to be very specific about that and the city council must affirmatively commit to the center district and Gentrified neighborhoods to build the homes and youth affirmative marketing and community preference, housing policies to ensure the homes are available to families who have been displaced from the neighborhood or who are at risk of displacement.",39,,
340,0.97,3089.286,3113.243,"As many of you know, following the call, more than 220 faith leaders and activists from many different faith traditions have written an open letter to the city last week calling on the city to support the build 1,000 homes demand in full and I'll make sure my staff forward to all Councilmembers to make sure everybody has a look at it.",39,,
341,0.97,3113.243,3130.694,"This letter was signed in three days' time by a wide range of people including Michael Ramos of the church Council of greater Seattle, Reverend Bianca Davis of the poor people's campaign.",39,,
342,0.97,3130.694,3140.537,"Elise, Co-Chairs of faith action network, sister of Raymond.",39,,
343,0.97,3140.537,3152.649,"Jason Levine and James moral, among other Rabbis and of course the Reverend Robert Jeffreys.",39,,
344,0.97,3152.649,3155.085,Senior pastor of the central district.,39,,
345,0.97,3155.085,3165.028,"Reverend Lawrence Willis, true vine of Holiness mission Baptist church.",39,,
346,0.97,3165.028,3165.562,Reverend Dr. Kerry church.,39,,
347,0.97,3165.562,3181.044,"Reverend Willy seals, the Christ spirit church, and Bishop Gary Tyson, good will missionary Baptist church and Angela Yang who has played an important role in organizing this community.",39,,
348,0.97,3181.044,3194.124,The faith letter shows the breath of support behind this demand and I hope all Councilmembers will join us in supporting this spending plan amendment and I'm happy to share a draft with the amendment with other Council offices.,39,,
349,0.97,3194.124,3201.398,"If you're interested, contact my staff member Jonathan Rosenbloom and we're happy to share that.",39,,
350,0.97,3201.398,3215.011,"I will also report that the tax Amazon movement met for the fourth action conference to discuss debate and ultimately vote on what to do with the 30,000 ballot initiative signatures gathered by our volunteers.",39,,
351,0.97,3215.011,3244.274,"The resolution was passed almost unanimously to hold the signatures in reserve in case big business intends to file the referendum like in 2018 but otherwise to hold on to them and in many ways, those 30,000 initiative signatures violent been the bed rock of winning this Amazon victory because clearly big business would not have made the concession if it were not for a concrete threat, a credible threat of a ballot initiative.",39,,
352,0.97,3244.274,3257.287,The activist should make note of the impact that we can have and the game changing consequences of having a genuine grassroots movement.,39,,
353,0.97,3257.287,3275.472,"Amazon was a grass roots movement, has won hundreds of millions of dollars through the only pro Depressive tax options, paid entirely by big business and one week later, we're seeing the legislation from the Mayor's office for Seattle transportation district which does not yet have a movement around it.",39,,
354,0.97,3275.472,3293.256,"As a result, the same elected officials who are proposing yes on the Amazon tax are very likely getting ready to vote for an extremely aggressive sales tax increase paid for by working class people.",39,,
355,0.97,3293.256,3299.596,"The Mayor has put forward, cutting the city's share of funding for King County Metro by three fourths.",39,,
356,0.97,3299.596,3300.864,This is a big cut.,39,,
357,0.97,3300.864,3309.406,It clearly shows that working people cannot trust the political establishment and needs to rely on the strength of our own movement.,39,,
358,0.97,3309.406,3319.582,"If members of committee wants to not have it paid by aggressive tax mechanisms, we'll have to fight for it like we fought for and won the Amazon tax.",39,,
359,0.97,3319.582,3359.956,"I was pleased to see that seven of the nine Council members have publicly stated support for the justice for George Floyd movement to cut police budget by at least 50% and I was happy to be at the press conference with some of the other Council members last week and then, as I said before, and as I said at the press conference, in the budget committee, my office will be bringing, in coordination with the budget campaign, an amendment legislation to cut $85 million from the 2020 Seattle police Department budget, which is the remaining budget for this year or 50% of the remaining budget for this year.",39,,
360,0.97,3359.956,3361.291,That is an estimate.,39,,
361,0.97,3361.291,3368.398,I'll be happy to look into cutting more and funding social programs instead and vital human needs.,39,,
362,0.97,3368.398,3369.999,Also wanted to share with the public.,39,,
363,0.97,3369.999,3381.244,"We're watching that as the city council is doing, the Mayor Durkan is holding her own press conference and my staff are monitoring that press conference.",39,,
364,0.97,3381.244,3392.622,Mayor Durkan has said that she will Voto any cut from the city council for the police if it zeros out the budget or if it des not meet the need for service.,39,,
365,0.97,3392.622,3413.543,"I wanted to share some highlights that my staff has shared with me from the press conference which shows the kind of, you know, political gas lighting and the loss services that are being raised by Mayor Durkan's office very dishonestly and the police chief.",39,,
366,0.97,3413.543,3435.098,"They claim that Mayor Durkan has claimed in the press conference or at least raised the question, again, without any basis in reality, that the decision, if the city Council decides to Defund SPD by 50% this year and 50% next year, she asked the question, would that take us out of compliance with the Federal consent decree?",39,,
367,0.97,3435.098,3435.999,This is dishonest.,39,,
368,0.97,3435.999,3437.634,It is not talking about just Defunding police.,39,,
369,0.97,3437.634,3462.392,"It is about changing the way the police Department operates, meaning we have to actually address the violence, the racism and excessive use of force, all of the extremely problematic situation with the police Department and then holding them accountable in all of this, in addition, Defunding is going to need an elective community over sight board with powers over the police, including hiring and firing and policies and procedures.",39,,
370,0.97,3462.392,3470.166,And so it is important that we push back against this dishonesty from Mayor Durkan and from chief best.,39,,
371,0.97,3470.166,3477.474,Chief best also at the press conference said something to the effect of I will not sacrifice officers of color for political points.,39,,
372,0.97,3477.474,3505.001,"As a matter of fact, what is going on is Mayor Durkan and the police leadership using, again, more gas lighting tactics in order to push back against, they're threatening people of color who are demanding the Defunding of police by saying that, well, if you want to Defund, what is going to happen is officers of color or other minority community officers will lose their jobs first.",39,,
373,0.97,3505.001,3506.803,We do not accept that.,39,,
374,0.97,3506.803,3523.953,"There is nothing, absolutely nothing preventing the city from negotiating an agreement with the police officer's Guild that protects officers of color as UFCW Treasury Secretary noted on Friday in a Tweet and I will quote that Tweet.",39,,
375,0.97,3523.953,3530.76,"As a union leader I call BS on the quote, Unquote, seniority argument.",39,,
376,0.97,3530.76,3538.234,"They could bargain over solutions but instead they will hide behind labor principles to protect the White supremacy in SPD, Unquote.",39,,
377,0.97,3538.234,3547.176,"I think this is an important point that we're absolutely, you know, we will fight tooth and nail for labor rights but this is not about labor rights.",39,,
378,0.97,3547.176,3559.188,"This is about the rights of working people everywhere, supported by the labor Union as a whole to have a society free of racism and police violence and let's not confuse the two in any way.",39,,
379,0.97,3559.188,3566.796,Durkan is also outrageously repeatedly said and repeated this in the press conference that SPD training is literally the model for the nation.,39,,
380,0.97,3566.796,3567.196,Model for what?,39,,
381,0.97,3567.196,3576.272,"Model for not a single police officer being prosecuted for killings of ordinary people, especially black and Brown people?",39,,
382,0.97,3576.272,3578.274,Model for harassing homeless people and what for?,39,,
383,0.97,3578.274,3580.777,I'm not clear what she means by that.,39,,
384,0.97,3580.777,3588.685,"I would urge her office to clarify what they mean, what they think the Seattle police is a model for.",39,,
385,0.97,3588.685,3602.498,"We also have to note, you know, one other thing that she brought up in the press conference today in response to a media question is, and this is Paraphrasing or a close quote from a staff.",39,,
386,0.97,3602.498,3606.836,It is unclear to me what the Council means by cutting 50%.,39,,
387,0.97,3606.836,3607.971,They have said it different ways.,39,,
388,0.97,3607.971,3612.075,You should tell the public what your plan is to replace the services.,39,,
389,0.97,3612.075,3616.879,Do you want to reduce response time so they show up 15 or 20 minutes after you call?,39,,
390,0.97,3616.879,3617.313,Let's be clear.,39,,
391,0.97,3617.313,3621.718,Is this not what we're talking about.,39,,
392,0.97,3621.718,3623.519,"Again, this is completely misleading.",39,,
393,0.97,3623.519,3649.379,"I want to share, you know, Kiro 7 reported on June 22nd, 2020, young people, teens, call Seattle police repeatedly to tell them that there was--that they made a discovery of a Sutcase that had washed up on the rocks in West Seattle where they suspected that there were body parts, because they smelled an odor.",39,,
394,0.97,3649.379,3667.697,"Seattle police confirmed that they had a response time of an hour and a half and the teens tell us, and this is from a Tik TOK Video that went viral, they tell us that they called the police twice, but it took nearly three hours for the authorities to arrive.",39,,
395,0.97,3667.697,3673.903,To reject the idea of cutting the police budget or Defunding them of 50% is going to impact services negatively.,39,,
396,0.97,3673.903,3681.644,We have to talk about how the police only spend a small minority of their time investigating the actual egregious claims.,39,,
397,0.97,3681.644,3701.164,"The majority of the police time and this is where mathematics is important, the majority of time is used in harassing for communities, communities of color, homeless neighbors, abusing protesters and in the case of our sister, shooting the people that have called them for assistance.",39,,
398,0.97,3701.164,3707.27,These are the things that our movement is proposing that the police no longer spend time doing.,39,,
399,0.97,3707.27,3713.509,Not responding to emergency phone calls where there is a criminal element.,39,,
400,0.97,3713.509,3734.897,"I would appreciate the Mayor's office to not--and engage in the debate honestly and then the last point in relation to the cuts, of course, support the comments made by Councilmembers in this morning's briefing about standing in solidarity with the staff that are facing death threats and other threats and are showing a lot of courage.",39,,
401,0.97,3734.897,3752.381,We have to make sure we stand against the Mayor's--because the office of civil rights is one Department which does important work who are working really on short staff and the complaints don't get heard for months even though the staff are dedicated.,39,,
402,0.97,3752.381,3755.284,The Mayor has frozen open positions in the office of civil rights.,39,,
403,0.97,3755.284,3757.553,That applies to the office of labor standards as well.,39,,
404,0.97,3757.553,3776.472,The best way that the city council can show the support with staff is in addition to our messages of solidarity that we stop mandatory Furloughs or layoffs and end hiring freezes in crucial departments like civil rights and labor standards.,39,,
405,0.97,3776.472,3776.739,Thank you.,39,,
406,0.97,3776.739,3779.308,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant, for those remarks.",40,,
407,0.97,3779.308,3785.548,Are there any questions or comments on that report?,40,,
408,0.97,3785.548,3786.282,Okay.,40,,
409,0.97,3786.282,3793.623,"Hearing and seeing none, we will move down the line to Councilmember Straus.",40,,
410,0.97,3793.623,3799.495,"Thank you, Council President, good morning, colleagues.",41,,
411,0.97,3799.495,3804.8,The land use and neighborhoods committee have two items on the introduction and referral calendar today.,41,,
412,0.97,3804.8,3817.847,"Council bill 119832, FEMA required legislation to update Seattle's flood insurance rate maps and due to a Federal deadline, my intention is to bring the legislation directly to full council next week.",41,,
413,0.97,3817.847,3820.283,Also on the IRC is CB 119831.,41,,
414,0.97,3820.283,3837.833,"The child care near you package, which the land use committee will be taking up over the next several weeks making technical changes to how our child care facilities are permitted throughout the city, reducing costs, and allowing for child care to be near you throughout the city.",41,,
415,0.97,3837.833,3843.639,"The next meeting of the land use and neighborhoods Committee is next Wednesday, July 22nd.",41,,
416,0.97,3843.639,3846.976,The best day the year for some our colleagues.,41,,
417,0.97,3846.976,3852.682,We'll hold public hearings on the child care near you package and the land use bill.,41,,
418,0.97,3852.682,3867.597,We will also hear a report from Sdci and Osc on their tree protection work that has been occurring throughout this Covid pandemic despite not being able to present in our land use and neighborhoods committee.,41,,
419,0.97,3867.597,3868.297,Regarding jump start Seattle.,41,,
420,0.97,3868.297,3872.568,"On Wednesday, I'll be proposing two amendments to the jump start Seattle spending bills.",41,,
421,0.97,3872.568,3882.078,One amendment would add an additional $9 million to the small business stabilization fund to be taken from the revenue stabilization Fund and emergency funds.,41,,
422,0.97,3882.078,3890.887,Another amendment would express the city council's intent to provide additional small business support by providing relief through BNO taxes.,41,,
423,0.97,3890.887,3903.266,I'm thankful to the opportunity to have worked with Councilmember Mosqueda and Council President Gonzalez to have a few amendments included in the substitute to the 2020 relief bill so that we can stream line the process on Wednesday.,41,,
424,0.97,3903.266,3923.419,One of those changes that we work together on is increasing the eligible for small business support to businesses with up to ten FTE's from the decrease if they have part time workers and extending the range a little bit.,41,,
425,0.97,3923.419,3935.965,"Thank you to the great work from staff, Noah, and others in other offices for taking a look at how many businesses have what levels of employees.",41,,
426,0.97,3935.965,3939.735,That helped us craft this amendment in a great way.,41,,
427,0.97,3939.735,3952.949,I will also be making an amendment that allows--that is included in the substitute that allows Non-Profits that provide community services eligible for the support as well.,41,,
428,0.97,3952.949,3956.686,I would like to take a moment to discuss the Defunding of the police.,41,,
429,0.97,3956.686,3964.794,I want to make sure that everyone in our community knows that Defunding the police does not mean decreasing public safety.,41,,
430,0.97,3964.794,3968.864,"In fact, it means increasing public safety for so many members of our community.",41,,
431,0.97,3968.864,3973.736,The city has not been providing public safety in a way that our communities want.,41,,
432,0.97,3973.736,3981.01,I have heard this in Ballard and I know public safety works different in Ballard than on beacon Hill.,41,,
433,0.97,3981.01,3987.55,It works differently in Rainier Beach that in riven.,41,,
434,0.97,3987.55,3991.02,We are defining how the cuts to the police Department will occur.,41,,
435,0.97,3991.02,3997.593,"In this transition, you will always be able to call 911 and have someone respond to your call as is the case today.",41,,
436,0.97,3997.593,4010.673,"Our metric of success at the conclusion of the transition will be that when you call 911, you get a fast response 24/7 with the appropriate first Responder who has the resources that they need to resolve the call.",41,,
437,0.97,4010.673,4016.245,Transitions take time to be successful and we need to be strategic with the changes.,41,,
438,0.97,4016.245,4022.385,We need to set up programs for success so that they and the people working within the programs are successful.,41,,
439,0.97,4022.385,4027.356,The worst thing that we can do is transfer responsibility before programs are ready.,41,,
440,0.97,4027.356,4036.866,Watch them fail and then say this new way of providing public safety doesn't work.,41,,
441,0.97,4036.866,4041.637,We owe it to everyone to have a time for transition and are set up for success.,41,,
442,0.97,4041.637,4046.642,"Do we need a police officer with a gun responding to traffic stops, mental health calls, noncriminal calls.",41,,
443,0.97,4046.642,4047.743,The answer is no.,41,,
444,0.97,4047.743,4056.585,Do we need a fast 911 response with the appropriate first Responder with the resources that they need to be successful?,41,,
445,0.97,4056.585,4056.952,Absolutely yes.,41,,
446,0.97,4056.952,4060.856,We have talked about expanding programs we have in place.,41,,
447,0.97,4060.856,4067.296,"Health one, crisis response team, and others as we continue to speak about cahoots in Eugene.",41,,
448,0.97,4067.296,4078.174,It is a good program and the largest difference between their program and our program is that cahoots is hard wired into 911 and doesn't require an officer to make the referral.,41,,
449,0.97,4078.174,4087.817,We have the programs we have here in Seattle in place and we need to hard wire them into 911 so that they don't need a referral from a police officer.,41,,
450,0.97,4087.817,4095.791,We have had daily protests in our city for over a month with the message to listen to the black community.,41,,
451,0.97,4095.791,4099.929,The black community is not monolithic are have a similar voice.,41,,
452,0.97,4099.929,4102.364,We have a consistent message of Defunding the police.,41,,
453,0.97,4102.364,4111.273,What we heard last week in committee was an organized members of our black community making very specific requests for our city government to act on.,41,,
454,0.97,4111.273,4116.245,We heard the proposal to scale down SPD funding and scale up community based programs.,41,,
455,0.97,4116.245,4122.852,It is a false narrative to say the approaches will not work and cannot work because they're not ready to step in today.,41,,
456,0.97,4122.852,4130.326,"Again, the worse thing we can do is give organizations the responsibility of responding without the time they need to scale up and be successful.",41,,
457,0.97,4130.326,4137.199,We need to set up the programs and organizations to succeed in this transition.,41,,
458,0.97,4137.199,4142.204,We also received 911 calling analysis and information which leads us to understand that the changes are possible.,41,,
459,0.97,4142.204,4150.279,"We have, for too long, required the police officers to be the social workers, mental health providers, homelessness response and protecting public safety.",41,,
460,0.97,4150.279,4158.32,It was clear to me from SPD's presentation in committee that we have the ability to place these responsibilities with the appropriate first responders.,41,,
461,0.97,4158.32,4167.963,We are clearly defining where the cuts are coming from so that we're not taking a percentage off the top of the budget.,41,,
462,0.97,4167.963,4180.809,"We're using a Scalpel, not an ax to change how we providing public safety and we need to act with urgency and strategy.",41,,
463,0.97,4180.809,4189.518,"Our future is bright, the solutions are clear and in front of us, and we have the opportunity to make important changes and to create the world we know is possible.",41,,
464,0.97,4189.518,4204.433,We will ensure public safety is maintained throughout this Tansition and that public safety is increased to all communities at the conclusion of the transition.,41,,
465,0.97,4204.433,4214.276,"As for distribute 6, wonderful distribute 6, I had the privilege of attending a rally for black lives matter and Defunding the police just yesterday.",41,,
466,0.97,4214.276,4219.548,I'm also seeing residents across distribute 6 representing for black lives matter.,41,,
467,0.97,4219.548,4227.256,"At corners throughout the district, getting cars to Honk and waving signs as well as having conversations with each other.",41,,
468,0.97,4227.256,4229.825,I have seen sustainable Ballard sunrise project.,41,,
469,0.97,4229.825,4235.864,Folks in Greenwood at 85th and Greenwood and Barbara and Jordan on 56th and 15th one night.,41,,
470,0.97,4235.864,4243.038,These are meaningful demonstrations of the values that folks in district 6 have.,41,,
471,0.97,4243.038,4247.343,I attended the Ballard Council to discuss land use in Ballard and on market street.,41,,
472,0.97,4247.343,4258.287,It was a great conversation and I really appreciated having the opportunity to attend much I also attended the rate payer committee to discuss issues important to the neighborhood.,41,,
473,0.97,4258.287,4260.689,"Homelessness, public safety and jump start Seattle.",41,,
474,0.97,4260.689,4272.468,"I also spoke to residents during our D6 residents conversations that I have every week about, again, homelessness, Defunding the police, curb cuts, trees and land use.",41,,
475,0.97,4272.468,4278.507,I have one constituent speak to me.,41,,
476,0.97,4278.507,4292.588,She talked to me about licenses and how she needs a license to perform her duties and that follows her from any place of employment in any state.,41,,
477,0.97,4292.588,4301.33,Her desire to have also police officers or peace officers have a similar license.,41,,
478,0.97,4301.33,4302.297,It requires continuing education.,41,,
479,0.97,4302.297,4306.702,It requires certain amount of up front training.,41,,
480,0.97,4306.702,4310.639,Her license actually takes longer to complete an the police Academy.,41,,
481,0.97,4310.639,4312.508,That was something she noted to me.,41,,
482,0.97,4312.508,4328.857,"One of the most important points that she mentioned is that if a massage therapist has a violation of their duties and responsibility, that goes on their record and that follows them wherever they are employed and whatever state they work.",41,,
483,0.97,4328.857,4341.47,She thinks that that would be a good thing to also have our police and peace officers have as part of their hiring requirements.,41,,
484,0.97,4341.47,4341.87,I have to agree.,41,,
485,0.97,4341.87,4354.249,We also worked in distribute 6 on getting the Golden gardens lock back open and having changes made to the stay healthy Street up and down Golden gardens way.,41,,
486,0.97,4354.249,4356.785,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez for your leadership in parks as always.",41,,
487,0.97,4356.785,4370.132,"We have spoken to a group working to expand sunset park into the street, so that is an emerging topic that I continue to track and work with them on, and again, we continue to hold resident meetings by phone every week.",41,,
488,0.97,4370.132,4377.005,I really missed the opportunity to get to work with the people and person in our district office.,41,,
489,0.97,4377.005,4378.941,Phone will have to do for now.,41,,
490,0.97,4378.941,4387.483,"As far as regional committees, last week I attended the Association of Washington committees which is very meeting.",41,,
491,0.97,4387.483,4399.528,It is great to see our other cities and this week I will also be attending a regional transit and mobility Committee in addition to the budget and special committee on transportation.,41,,
492,0.97,4399.528,4404.6,"Thank you, Council President, that is my report.",41,,
493,0.97,4404.6,4407.803,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",42,,
494,0.97,4407.803,4410.472,Any comments or questions for Councilmember Strauss?,42,,
495,0.97,4410.472,4411.106,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",42,,
496,0.97,4411.106,4419.648,"Councilmember Strauss, I just want to thank you, especially for your comments on clarifying what Defunding really means.",43,,
497,0.97,4419.648,4445.274,"I think your words speak volume to the impact that we're talking about in communities, really investing in community is a more important word to use and I couldn't say it better so just want to thank you for your eloquent words and we'll be looking to highlight the comments you just shared with the community over and over as we seek to clarify what it truly means to reinvest and Reenvision what public safety and community safety means.",43,,
498,0.97,4445.274,4456.251,I would love to share those out via our Blog if you have those in writing and have you featured as a guest.,43,,
499,0.97,4456.251,4457.419,I would love that.,44,,
500,0.97,4457.419,4486.682,"I want to echo my thanks for speaking so eloquently about the work that the city council is actually trying to do as opposed to the spin that we're hearing about the work that we are under taking, especially appreciate your comments about how the Council is not looking alternative blunt cuts, as described by the executive.",45,,
501,0.97,4486.682,4505.367,We're looking at Scalpel-Like approaches to scale down what we use law enforcement to respond to and what we can scale up in terms of Community-Based investments that we know are a public health approach that will actually be more effective at addressing some of those issues that we are currently asking law enforcement to respond to.,45,,
502,0.97,4505.367,4538.133,And so I think it is really important to continue to talk about this plan of transition to scale down law enforcement investments and scale up Community-Based investments in a way that positions us to truly put forward a public safety model that is going to be responsive to the calls from black lives matter movement and still comply with their obligation to deliver on public safety.,45,,
503,0.97,4538.133,4557.986,"Community service officers, it is something we already do, for example, and those are unarmed folks who respond to issues within the communities that are non-violent, that are, you know, needed--need a sort of type of response and we're already investing in it.",45,,
504,0.97,4557.986,4606.201,"There is no reason why we couldn't look at stronger investments in the community service officer program, for example, as one of those potential models, so, again, really excited about the opportunity to continue to have these Nuanced conversations about what approaches we can take over the coming months and years to make sure that we are actually rebuilding our public safety model and not just tooling around the edges and am heartened by the fact that so many Council members are spending so much time on the issue and are really rolling up their sleeves to not just speak their values but to put those values into action.",45,,
505,0.97,4606.201,4607.369,Thanks again for those comments.,45,,
506,0.97,4607.369,4610.238,"Thank you, all.",46,,
507,0.97,4610.238,4614.776,"Next up is Councilmember Herbold, please.",47,,
508,0.97,4614.776,4621.149,.,47,,
509,0.97,4621.149,4622.217,Got it.,48,,
510,0.97,4622.217,4622.551,Good morning.,48,,
511,0.97,4622.551,4623.018,"Greetings, everybody.",48,,
512,0.97,4623.018,4634.229,"Just to start off, consistent with the Council's resolution regarding committee meetings, the public safety and human services committee meeting for July 14th has been cancelled.",48,,
513,0.97,4634.229,4657.085,"Just want to give a little shout out to the work that the Seattle fire Department is doing under its Covid-19 test sites that are administered at both two sites, one in Soto and one in Aurora.",48,,
514,0.97,4657.085,4658.587,Or up on Aurora.,48,,
515,0.97,4658.587,4665.16,"They have done more than 48,000 tests for folks.",48,,
516,0.97,4665.16,4679.408,"It is a walk up service, drive up service, and it is some work that the fire Department is doing that hasn't gotten, I think, enough attention.",48,,
517,0.97,4679.408,4690.185,I think folks read last week about the Greek row outbreak at the Udub.,48,,
518,0.97,4690.185,4704.8,Those folks got tested as a fire Department testing site and the fire Department was actually the ones who alerted Seattle King County public health that we had another outbreak.,48,,
519,0.97,4704.8,4720.048,"Again, the work that they're doing is incredibly important and their turn around time for test results is also a real key to their success.",48,,
520,0.97,4720.048,4738.066,"Want to thank folks for that work, and also, I'm happy to share sort of more granular details about the demographics of who they're testing and the results for those tests if anybody is interested.",48,,
521,0.97,4738.066,4763.792,"On Friday evening I sent a letter to the Mayor and police chief regarding the threat to local journalists, Salisbury of converged media and the actual arrest of Andrew Buncomb E, the U.S. correspondent.",48,,
522,0.97,4763.792,4768.73,Both as the chop was cleared on July 1ST.,48,,
523,0.97,4768.73,4787.749,"British Ambassador launched an official complaint with the State Department and White House over the arrest of Mr. Buncombe, and my letter notes that while Mr. Salisbury was not arrested, I'm concerned that such actions can have a chilling effect oppress coverage.",48,,
524,0.97,4787.749,4802.03,"First amendment protections for the press of the United States Constitution are a Lynchpin of American democracy and less respected by the government, the quality of our democracy is diminished and eroded.",48,,
525,0.97,4802.03,4821.716,"Further, our own laws, in this case, Seattle municipal code 12a .12020 that addresses the failure to Disburse explicitly Exempts news reporters in the event of a public safety order.",48,,
526,0.97,4821.716,4828.523,"Further, this Council adopted an observer's bill of rights in 2017 which clearly States the right to observe the ACS of officers.",48,,
527,0.97,4828.523,4839.835,I believe it is our job as elected officials to ensure the press remains free and is able to carry out its work in Accordions with the Constitution and city law.,48,,
528,0.97,4839.835,4865.193,Constitution and city law protections for the press and observers do not exist for the convenience of government to be cast aside when it is inconvenient for government and the letter requests the Mayor and city attorney to remedy this unacceptable a Bridgement of the first amendment and improper use of city law.,48,,
529,0.97,4865.193,4897.525,I also want to thank all of my colleagues on the Council who have spoke very eloquently to our efforts to Defund the Seattle police Department budget and reinvest in Community-Based public safety programs that are Evidence-Based and we know can deliver positive public safety outcomes for our community.,48,,
530,0.97,4897.525,4910.038,"I don't have much to add because I think everybody spoke very, very well on what we're doing and what we're not doing.",48,,
531,0.97,4910.038,4927.355,"I'll put aside, in the instance--in the seeking of brevity, I'll put aside my broader remarks, but want to zero in on a couple of things we have heard from the chief over the weekend.",48,,
532,0.97,4927.355,4951.646,"As it relates to the statement that the Council intends to zero out the entire fourth quarter budget for SPD and reduce 50% of the total work force, I just want to say that I and other Council members are continuing to work through the Seattle police departments budget and in beginning stages of developing proposals.",48,,
533,0.97,4951.646,4967.595,"I recognize this will be a short process for the rebalancing of the budget, but Nevertheless, I'm not sure how it is that the chief can be PROG on the budget that haven't been developed yet.",48,,
534,0.97,4967.595,4980.208,"In the case that some layoffs are necessary of the many very worst case scenario that's the chief poses, one is the firing of officers.",48,,
535,0.97,4980.208,4993.388,"I want to state very, very clearly that the chief is empowered under the public safety civil service Commission, rule 15, to implement layoffs in a way that is called out of order.",48,,
536,0.97,4993.388,4999.928,This means she does not have to fire the newest officers hired first.,48,,
537,0.97,4999.928,5013.908,"She can request the public safety civil service Commission, executive director, for permission to layoff out of order, when doing so is in the interest of efficient operations of his or her Department.",48,,
538,0.97,5013.908,5022.384,She is making the argument to the public now that firing members of the police Department would be harmful.,48,,
539,0.97,5022.384,5044.773,"I agree wholeheartedly and I know that the chief can argue just as convincingly that maintaining the employment of officers is in the interest of SPD in requesting the permission to do layoffs out of order, to the public safety civil service Commission executive director.",48,,
540,0.97,5044.773,5053.681,I'm confident that she can make this argument and get this permission.,48,,
541,0.97,5053.681,5068.496,"So I think the worst case scenario picture is really in the chief's hands when she decides the priorities that she wants to set, should layoffs be necessary.",48,,
542,0.97,5068.496,5076.771,"As it relates to the Southwest Precinct, I want to raise the fact that although, under the chart ye, the chief decides how to deploy officers.",48,,
543,0.97,5076.771,5088.116,The Charter also States that there shall be maintained adequate police protection in each District of the city.,48,,
544,0.97,5088.116,5099.327,"The Charter doesn't protect SPD officers doing social work or addressing mental health issues, addressing noise complaints or traffic stops for example.",48,,
545,0.97,5099.327,5115.009,This is the effort that we're making to narrow the number of things that SPD does to take out of their hands the responsibility to address things that are not related to law enforcement.,48,,
546,0.97,5115.009,5129.958,"Finally, the Seattle budget has a budget control level for each Precinct, including the Southwest Precinct, and it is the Council that has budget authority for the funding for each budget control level or the spending for each precinct.",48,,
547,0.97,5129.958,5153.882,"In closing, on this topic, I just want to say I appreciate the update provided by deputy Mayor about the Mayor and chief's announcement for estimates that they estimate to be between 76 to $86 million in reductions to the s approximately Fd's 2021 budget and look forward to reviewing those more carefully.",48,,
548,0.97,5153.882,5187.215,"Just highlighting, this is something that we'll be talking about more in the budget process starting on Wednesday but just want to let folks know in case of other members have been contacted about this issue, that along with Councilmember Morales, I'm proposing a proviso to remove the Seattle police Department to the Gatekeeping function it currently plays in the law enforcement assisted diversion program lead and Co-Lead, Co-Lead being the evolution of lead during the public health emergency.",48,,
549,0.97,5187.215,5203.798,"This is at the request of the public defender's Association which operates lead and Co-Lead as most of you know, both are Prearrest diversion programs for people involved in low level criminal activity.",48,,
550,0.97,5203.798,5207.769,Currently all referrals must be reviewed and approved by SPD.,48,,
551,0.97,5207.769,5258.286,"The problem stems from SPD's current lack of capacity to provide this function and the result for Co-Lead is that they're essentially unable to act on any new referrals now that they are receiving from community members, from social contact referrals and we have provided them resource to assist these people and they are unable to do so because they have not been able to get SPD to, basically, approve those referrals because of their current lack of capacity to do so.",48,,
552,0.97,5258.286,5265.693,"So, they have unique and scarce resources including specialized case management and they are going on used.",48,,
553,0.97,5265.693,5316.611,"They are providing the referrals to be accepted from Community sources and public agencies without requiring SPD to approve those referrals and it will not change the positive and collaborative relationship the lead has built with SPD officers and removes them from the administrative hurdle at the start of a referral and as relates to work happening in the human service Department, I want folks to know a bit of an update about the legislation that we voted on last week to appropriate 13 million dollars in one-time funding from the State Department of Commerce to support Covid response.",48,,
554,0.97,5316.611,5340.668,These are sorely needed and anxiously awaited funds to reimburse frontline homeless providers for extraordinary efforts and unanticipated costs to serve people during this pandemic and I pushed hard to appropriate these funds as soon as we receive the legislation and I appreciate the chairs support and Council approval on that expedited Timeline.,48,,
555,0.97,5340.668,5371.399,"Lesson 24 hours after the vote, the human services Department released their Rfp for 4.9 million dollars of these funds and I want to appreciate the extraordinary speed with which Hsd acted after receiving the green light from Council and the intent of the Rfp is to help Nonprofits to stay in guidelines of protection from the CDC without reducing the capacity of the Seattle homeless response system.",48,,
556,0.97,5371.399,5383.878,"Proposals are due July 17 and awards will be made by July 27 with funding awards covering the period of March 1 2020 through December December 31, 2020.",48,,
557,0.97,5383.878,5396.224,"Again, thanks to Hsd for their quick reaction to get these dollars out the door and I will let you know more about the Timeline on the balance of those dollars and the balance of the 13 million dollars, as soon as I learn more.",48,,
558,0.97,5396.224,5412.874,"Finally, as far as the departments in my reporting area, I just want to highlight what we've all heard from public health.",48,,
559,0.97,5412.874,5423.818,We know that the Coronavirus has been increasing in King County since mid-June and there has been the largest increase in New cases in young adults and Seattle residents.,48,,
560,0.97,5423.818,5435.93,Public health Seattle and King County is warning that the risk for infection has increased and our community has been better than most and it's important to follow the guidelines that have kept us safe so far.,48,,
561,0.97,5435.93,5450.978,Stay 6 feet apart from others and minimize contact with others outside your home and frequent Handwashing and hand Sanitizer with the use of cloth face coverings and avoid group gatherings in poorly ventilated spaces.,48,,
562,0.97,5450.978,5454.282,I want to highlight that Coronavirus testing is free.,48,,
563,0.97,5454.282,5467.128,"Consider being tested if you've recently been in close contact with anyone with Covid or if you've experienced symptoms like fever, cough, difficulty breathing, cough, muscle aches or loss of taste or smell.",48,,
564,0.97,5467.128,5483.611,"If you have a health care provider, contact them about being tested and if you don't, the public health of Seattle King County has a Website where you can find a list of free testing locations regardless of immigration status and with free language interpretation.",48,,
565,0.97,5483.611,5486.28,Google King County Covid testing locations.,48,,
566,0.97,5486.28,5521.649,"Lastly, I want to flag for everybody on the Council a couple of amendments coming up for select budget committee and we will be circulating an amendment cosponsored by Councilmember Mosqueda to set aside a portion of Jumpstart revenue starting in 2022 for permanently affordable housing projects in the housing and services bucket of spending and it would be 5% of the revenue for affordable housing homeownership.",48,,
567,0.97,5521.649,5536.631,"The projects would, of course, only serve households up to 80% AMI and specifically targeted those at risk of displacement from communities or those who face barriers to Accessing homeownership due to past discriminatory policies and practices.",48,,
568,0.97,5536.631,5556.183,"As relates to the 2020 Covid relief navigation amendment, to Council bill 119812, working on an amendment specifically for direct financial assistance to Seattle's low income, immigrant and refugee workers and households.",48,,
569,0.97,5556.183,5573.801,"And, ensuring that some of those funds are used to advise or provide navigation support to the recipients of direct aid to ensure that they can avoid inadvertently losing other income tested benefits.",48,,
570,0.97,5573.801,5574.402,That's al I have for today.,48,,
571,0.97,5574.402,5580.508,Thank you.,48,,
572,0.97,5580.508,5581.342,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",49,,
573,0.97,5581.342,5588.482,Any questions or comments for Councilmember Herbold?,49,,
574,0.97,5588.482,5594.755,"It looks like they are Arnon and Councilmember Herbold, I thank you for your ongoing work in the space as chair of the public safety committee.",49,,
575,0.97,5594.755,5606.133,"I know that you are staying fairly busy at the moment with both the responsibilities of chairing public safety and also, the human services Department, in general.",49,,
576,0.97,5606.133,5677.705,"We appreciate your ongoing work and I want to make a quick comment on the issues related to diversity hiring and recruitment at the Seattle police Department and I wanted to make a note that while it is true that the city Council and the Seattle police Commission have advocated strongly in the past for strategies and resources being dedicated to making sure that the racial makeup of the Seattle residents is reflected in the police Department . I also want to make sure that folks understand that there is no wants Tothat position and the new ones, basically, and I'm quoting from a report done, two reports by the police Commission, one in 2016 and the other in 2017 where it says, quote, racial Congruity, loan, is not enough to build rapport with communities, many of which have long felt oppressed by governmental institutions.",49,,
577,0.97,5677.705,5728.389,"So, I think it's really important for us to understand that the argument that Bipoc officers lead to less oppression and less excessive force and increased amount of trust from communities of color, that it is not necessarily true . What is important, it's not only diverse hires, but making sure that the police Department is taking a step further with regard to those hires and including making sure that those individuals of color that are being hired have a true understanding of the different needs of those communities.",49,,
578,0.97,5728.389,5752.48,"For example, the community police Commission report from January 2016 said, quote, research says experts report that when a police Department's officers reflect the racial demographics of the communities, they serve the Department and it fulfills important purposes.",49,,
579,0.97,5752.48,5764.458,"If the police Department reasonably reflects the ethnic and racial makeup, it conveys a sense of equity to the public and if not, it can invite suspicion as to why members of various racial and ethnic groups are not representative.",49,,
580,0.97,5764.458,5780.608,"It increases the probability that the Department can understand that they can communicate more effectively and in point, police officers who understand and empathize with various cultures may contribute to more effective policing.",49,,
581,0.97,5780.608,5793.954,"Third, it increases the likelihood that officers will come to better understand and respect the various ethnic perspectives through their daily interactions and lack of exposure to other cultures can increase the likelihood that citizens' motives will be misunderstood.",49,,
582,0.97,5793.954,5807.334,I think it's really important for us to appreciate or understand the comments from chief best in that contest.,49,,
583,0.97,5807.334,5837.264,"That is not diversity for the sake of diversity, but it is increasing the racial and ethnic diversity within the sworn officer personnel that has to be cultivated in a way that is allowing those officers to function within a system that appreciates and values and supports the cultural and linguistic and ethnic understanding of communities that have been historically over policed and are currently over policed.",49,,
584,0.97,5837.264,5849.677,Only then will we see positive results of the increase in diversity and our law enforcement agencies.,49,,
585,0.97,5849.677,5890.818,"And, the National research bears that out and I appreciate the Seattle police Commission's efforts in doing research specific to the Seattle police Department and that was reported in January 2016 and there was a follow-up in 2017, as well, that I think will be important context for the public and certainly, for us, as policymakers, to continue to keep an I on as we continue to identify ways to right size this police Department to respond to the issues that they need to respond to and not respond to the issues they don't need to respond to.",49,,
586,0.97,5890.818,5920.614,"I want to highlight the community police Commission and thank them for doing a lot of work, historical work, in the space of recruitment and retention, particularly relating to diversity and the outcomes we can see if diverse hires are made . again, that's only as good as the environment in which we are asking them to work in and the system we ask those individuals to work within.",49,,
587,0.97,5920.614,5951.545,"Your points are well made and will taken, Councilmember Herbold, around the power that the chief holds in making those decisions and the persuasive nature of her ability to be able to advocate for changes she needs that would not set the police Department back on the diversity, hiring and recruitment they've been unsuccessful on over the last 2- 3 years.",49,,
588,0.97,5951.545,5955.983,Any other questions or comments for Councilmember Herbold?,49,,
589,0.97,5955.983,5970.798,"Hearing none, I don't have anything to report other than to say that I don't have anything on this afternoon's full council agenda.",49,,
590,0.97,5970.798,5976.937,I've reported on other things we've been working on and did my duties at the top of the hour with the President's report.,49,,
591,0.97,5976.937,5998.125,"So, we will go ahead and close out the public portion of this morning's Council briefing, unless there is anything else for the good of the order before I transition us to executive session.",49,,

594,0.97,5999.426,6032.593,I was slow on the draw and want to say thank you to Councilmember Herbold for summarizing the effect of arresting the journalists and how abhorrent it is and how important it was for the report or to describe the experience of being arrested and what happened to him and what happened in the jail when he was there.,50,,
595,0.97,6032.593,6055.449,"Thank you for flagging that and I will note that I'm interested in working with you as the chair of public safety to follow up on that incident, recognizing that we've now had a reporter jailed and another reporter that was hit with a flash bang . We want to make sure, as we've talked to other reporters about in the last few weeks, we want to make sure that reporters feel safe in our community and I look forward to following up with you on that and the conversations I've had with a number of journalists in the area about the need to do that on many levels.",50,,
596,0.97,6055.449,6059.086,I look forward to following up with you on that conversation.,50,,
597,0.97,6059.086,6067.961,"If you get updates on the status of that individual, we would love to hear those as the summer continues.",50,,
598,0.97,6067.961,6075.969,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Mosqueda, for those last words and we will move into executive session.",51,,
599,0.97,6075.969,6091.351,"I'm announcing the Seattle city council will now convene an executive session with two executive sessions scheduled for this morning and into the afternoon and the purpose is to discuss pending, potential or actual litigation and labor negotiations.",51,,
600,0.97,6091.351,6101.829,"The executive sessions are an opportunity for the Council to discuss confidential legal matters with city attorneys, as authorized by law and illegal monitor from the city attorney office is always present to make sure there are questions of policy for open sessions.",51,,
601,0.97,6101.829,6113.34,"I expect that the session, the executive sessions, that they will end in approximately 120 minutes, that's two hours.",51,,
602,0.97,6113.34,6125.352,"So, I'm expecting that we will end by no later than 1:15 P.M.",51,,
