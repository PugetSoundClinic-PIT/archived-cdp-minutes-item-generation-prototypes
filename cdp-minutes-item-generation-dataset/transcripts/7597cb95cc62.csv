34,0.97,169.769,177.31,"Next slide, please.",9,,
35,0.97,177.31,190.523,And what we are going to do also is start with a who we are and what we do to give you a sense of how Oed is changing under Mayor Harold's new administration as well as the changing economic conditions.,9,,
36,0.97,190.523,193.393,"So, what are we trying to do and who are we trying to become?",9,,
37,0.97,193.393,209.175,"Then we will talk about how racial equity and how our Rsji principles relate to economic development, a little and how we are putting this into action and talk about our commitments for the future.",9,,
38,0.97,209.175,220.987,I will start off by giving you the preamble and I will introduce our team members to talk about our accomplishments over the last year.,9,,
39,0.97,220.987,230.964,"I will note that while we are talking about the racial equity Toolkits, we will talk more broadly about our Covid response and how racial equity was a key part in how we drove some of those programs.",9,,
40,0.97,230.964,240.84,"It is a little more broad than what we were Tasked to do, but you will hear a good story and set us up for future conversations.",9,,
41,0.97,240.84,245.345,"I am sorry to interrupt, but we have been joined by Councilmember Herbold.",10,,
42,0.97,245.345,247.981,"Welcome, Councilmember Herbold.",11,,
43,0.97,247.981,251.818,"All right, next slide please, Philip.",11,,
44,0.97,251.818,267.533,"So, we have this opportunity in front of us emerging from the pandemic and having had our economy and certain industries and classes of work desecrated.",11,,
45,0.97,267.533,273.172,"As we think about what is next, it is not a recovery back to something.",11,,
46,0.97,273.172,309.475,"It is trying to build something new . We are trying to think about what is the Oed identity and role not just in the Seattle economic development system but how do we make sure that we are actually playing a particular part in Leveraging a lot of our partners through partnership, rather than Perating in a silo, which has sometimes been the risk of what Seattle has done in the past.",11,,
47,0.97,310.209,323.723,"Our mission and would like to see is building an inclusive economy where everyone in Seattle can fully participate and our role is driving economic growth through strategies and investments that open doors and remove barriers to individual, business, and community wealth building opportunities, particularly communities that have been systematically excluded from economic prosperity.",11,,
48,0.97,323.723,332.899,This is just our mission and how we are operating to make sure we are healing immunities that have been excluded from wealth building opportunities.,11,,
49,0.97,332.899,337.77,"Next slide, please.",11,,
50,0.97,337.77,342.642,And this is just to show that we do a lot of work with a lot of different folks.,11,,
51,0.97,342.642,348.948,We have a broad span of influence.,11,,
52,0.97,348.948,350.55,We are not just working with businesses.,11,,
53,0.97,350.55,352.852,We are not just working with workers.,11,,
54,0.97,352.852,366.999,"Business districts, a lot of people and a lot of organizations that we work with.",11,,
55,0.97,366.999,373.106,"As we go to the next slide, it's more important to think of how we are working with those folks, which is where the real difference is.",11,,
56,0.97,373.106,376.275,"Next slide, Phillip . really what we need to be is an Orchestrator.",11,,
57,0.97,376.275,394.527,"We need to be a catalyst within the regional economic development system . We are not going to be the biggest funding city at any table, nor will we be any biggest player at any given table.",11,,
58,0.97,394.527,403.369,What we really need to do is think about how we drive alignment and how we Hunt for multiple opportunities.,11,,
59,0.97,403.369,441.774,"If we are making a play, we want to make sure we are Leveraging that against other public, private, or philanthropic dollars were efforts . We don't necessarily--again, we are not bringing the big dollars in, but we could be the team that brings it together and Catalyze a new idea or bring new voices to the table in a unique or innovative way . As you can see here, what we really want to do is have a set of strategies for businesses that come to us needing help, so we are responding to them and helping connect our resources.",11,,
60,0.97,441.774,462.495,"We need to have enough capacity and space to initiate new things, to really be Proactive and think around the corner and Hunt for those opportunities and put together deals and projects that might not otherwise happen in a Reactive mode, so we need to have the Proactive and Reactive strategies built out.",11,,
61,0.97,462.495,463.696,I will give a quick example.,11,,
62,0.97,463.696,471.637,"Hopefully you thought recently the work our team did in cooperation with the state, the port.",11,,
63,0.97,471.637,480.379,"Many others have helped save the Seattle Maritime Academy, a huge workforce training tool for our industry.",11,,
64,0.97,480.379,494.193,"Again, we weren't necessarily the big money, but we could connect the deaths and pull the pieces together to make sure that got off the ground and stayed as a key piece of our industry.",11,,
65,0.97,494.193,496.629,"Next slide, please.",11,,
66,0.97,496.629,503.736,A lot of this leads to how racial equity is to this work.,11,,
67,0.97,503.736,515.314,"This Quot is something that Dr. Bostic said in the wake of George Floyd's murder, which today is the unfortunate anniversary of.",11,,
68,0.97,515.314,524.69,"He said, ""systemic racism is a yoke that drags on the American economy.",11,,
69,0.97,524.69,537.537,"This country has both a moral and economic imperative to end these unjust and destructive practices ."" we have this moral and economic imperative.",11,,
70,0.97,537.537,540.273,"As we think of economic development, that should be one of our North stars.",11,,
71,0.97,540.273,570.436,"It is driving our work and if we are doing it right, we are creating more opportunity and more wealth creation throughout our local and regional economy than if we were just going back, recovering back to something that was . again, trying to really think of what an inclusive economy is and bringing together individual wealth, business wealth, and community wealth in a unified way is really, really important.",11,,
72,0.97,570.436,581.914,This is our North Star as we think about where we are going next for Oed and the partnerships we will build and hopefully the wins we get for the city and the region.,11,,
73,0.97,581.914,582.548,"Next slide, please.",11,,
74,0.97,582.548,585.217,"So, as we are thinking about doing that, there are challenges and opportunities.",11,,
75,0.97,585.217,592.892,We are limited in what we can do as economic developers.,11,,
76,0.97,592.892,603.269,"There are other States and cities and regions that have much more direct tools . We have limits in our state, so we have got to be creative on how we navigate around those.",11,,
77,0.97,603.269,613.412,"We've also got--and I will be Frank, but we have had five directors in five years at Oed.",11,,
78,0.97,613.412,615.314,We have had a huge amount of staff turnover.,11,,
79,0.97,615.314,616.682,We are trying to fill vacancies.,11,,
80,0.97,616.682,628.027,We have internal capacity issues which we really need to address so we can get out of that Reactive cycle and into that Proactive thinking on how to build toward a future.,11,,
81,0.97,628.027,646.979,"We've got issues with how we are communicating what we do, this language access issue that is really important for us to get right because we can build the best programs in the world, but if they are not reaching populations that we really want to try to work with, we are doing it wrong.",11,,
82,0.97,646.979,654.653,That is a huge challenge as we look ahead and think of building toward the future.,11,,
83,0.97,654.653,661.06,"As I mentioned, some of the opportunities--there is a lack of regional alignment . We can be a leader in that regional construct.",11,,
84,0.97,661.06,676.208,"We can generate good ideas and good projects that leverage Federal dollars, that work with the state and other public, private, and philanthropic partners to fill unique and interesting models.",11,,
85,0.97,676.208,685.284,"One of the interesting ones we built back at the Chamber was the housing Connector group, which has spun off into its own self-sustaining nonprofit.",11,,
86,0.97,685.284,701.133,They've done really good work getting people housed and that exist as a Public-Private partnership and that is so keen . There are so many things we can do for economic development.,11,,
87,0.97,701.133,702.601,The final opportunity I will highlight is Storytelling.,11,,
88,0.97,702.601,704.603,We have incredible businesses and workers here in the city.,11,,
89,0.97,704.603,715.781,Oed wants to be the chief storyteller to lift up those stories and make sure we are highlighting the challenges but also celebrating those successes.,11,,
90,0.97,715.781,747.012,"One I will mention, we recently launched our Seattle restored Úprogram which is helping Bipoc business owners and vacant spaces downtown and the task down close to the Stadiums in the Pioneer square area, going down there and visiting with the business owner and learning how she is doing and how excited she is to have this space, and her ability to import goods from Africa and support entrepreneurs back there while also supporting herself as an entrepreneur is a great story.",11,,
91,0.97,747.012,754.186,How do we tell more of those and left those up which can inspire future generations?,11,,
92,0.97,754.186,756.622,That is something that is keen on our mind as well.,11,,
93,0.97,756.622,759.058,"Next slide please, Phillip.",11,,
94,0.97,759.058,774.173,Here we are talking again . We are trying to reorganize ourselves and rebuild our team culture.,11,,
95,0.97,774.173,776.108,"We have a skeleton crew right now, as I mentioned.",11,,
96,0.97,776.108,777.343,They have been through a lot.,11,,
97,0.97,777.343,786.285,"There is sensitivity around making sure people feel included, making sure people feel that there is transparency and they belong in the group.",11,,
98,0.97,786.285,790.122,"We've got real work to do, especially as we talk about race and racial issues on our team.",11,,
99,0.97,790.122,796.228,"For instance, we have both of our team leads out on extended leave right now.",11,,
100,0.97,796.228,808.207,One of the near-term opportunities for us is to rebuild our change team and invite some of our new staff in and make sure people feel included and like they belong.,11,,
101,0.97,808.207,811.477,We need to be clear and direct about these issues and not shy away from them.,11,,
102,0.97,811.477,822.655,"This will be a huge culture building moment for us as we add new team members in and as we talk about race and social justice issues, this shouldn't be a sideline thing but court our identity.",11,,
103,0.97,822.655,827.092,"Next slide, please.",11,,
104,0.97,827.092,832.164,That really leads us to looking backward at our racial equity work last year.,11,,
105,0.97,832.164,848.08,"We will start off talking about some of our racial equity Toolkit highlights and I am very pleased to introduce Scott Plusquellec from our team who will talk about the shop to the beat program, it's origin, and where it is going next.",11,,
106,0.97,848.08,851.283,"Scott, I will turn it over to you.",11,,
107,0.97,851.283,857.189,"Thank you very much, director Markham McIntyre and good morning, chair Nelson and committee members.",12,,
108,0.97,857.189,861.46,I appreciate the opportunity to present to you today.,12,,
109,0.97,861.46,868.133,My name is Scott Plusquellec and I am the Nightlight business advocate and program manager for the shop to the beat program.,12,,
110,0.97,868.133,876.275,I will be highlighting the racial equity Toolkit that informed and continues to be in progress on the shop to the beat program.,12,,
111,0.97,876.275,881.146,"Next slide, Phillip . Thank you.",12,,
112,0.97,881.146,884.316,"So, I wanted to give a little background on this.",12,,
113,0.97,884.316,902.101,A Webinar that I and my colleague attended back in August of 2020 on racism and the nighttime economy sponsored by a group called 24 hour Dallas.,12,,
114,0.97,902.101,911.81,It included address codes or a guest list designed to keep people of color out of certain establishments and Venues.,12,,
115,0.97,911.81,924.189,"Income disparity between musicians and artists, Bipoc artists and white artists and cultural exploitation.",12,,
116,0.97,924.189,943.275,"This is by white owned Venues, which included sort of using Bipoc musicians and artists in a certain way to promote their Venues . So, this RAISES the obvious question to us.",12,,
117,0.97,943.275,947.346,"If this is happening in Dallas, this clearly must be happening in Seattle and what does that look like?",12,,
118,0.97,947.346,970.102,"For a little background information on the context of what's happening, the current closures that have happened with all of the Venues shutting down the entire industry had basically started spurring conversations on what is building back music Ecosystem more equitably look like?",12,,
119,0.97,970.102,976.809,The industry was not equitable prior to the closures.,12,,
120,0.97,976.809,984.917,Taking this time--how do we take this time to actually look at that and work toward a more equitable industry?,12,,
121,0.97,984.917,1015.381,"And this included both locally and nationally, the Wanma and Niva to generate his conversations as well, so it was clear to us we needed to gather information and start talking and engaging with Stakeholders and figuring out how to use the information that we had received to inform city policymaking and how we design programs . next slide.",12,,
122,0.97,1015.381,1023.722,"We decided to start having these conversations and we wanted to start small . I'm sorry, I can see chair Nelson, you have a question?",12,,
123,0.97,1023.722,1028.327,"I'm sorry, you are on mute.",12,,
124,0.97,1028.327,1039.004,"Yeah, I had a specific question about this industry sector, so before we proceed past this.",13,,
125,0.97,1039.004,1041.907,I will let you finish and then I will ask that question.,13,,
126,0.97,1041.907,1044.243,Thanks.,13,,
127,0.97,1044.243,1044.643,Okay.,14,,
128,0.97,1044.643,1045.044,Thank you.,14,,
129,0.97,1045.044,1046.879,"Again, we decided to start fairly small.",14,,
130,0.97,1046.879,1062.728,We reached out to Bipoc industry professionals in Seattle to have one on one conversations with them and to lay the groundwork and get a sense on a personal level of what their experiences were.,14,,
131,0.97,1062.728,1088.353,"These folks ranged from professionals including promoters, producers, artists, musicians themselves, managers, and technicians . We asked them some of these questions, not limited to these questions but this was the basis for our conversation around sensibility and what it was like for them working in the industry.",14,,
132,0.97,1088.353,1090.756,Any Micro aggressions or instances of racism?,14,,
133,0.97,1090.756,1097.863,"And income disparities for them, or the ability to Monetize their work.",14,,
134,0.97,1097.863,1100.098,We asked how the Seattle industry compared to other cities.,14,,
135,0.97,1100.098,1110.876,"Then we started looking at, Okay, we knew we wanted to have larger conversations beyond these, so who else should be at the table?",14,,
136,0.97,1110.876,1112.077,What does the change look like?,14,,
137,0.97,1112.077,1117.549,How can or should the city lead or support this work?,14,,
138,0.97,1117.549,1120.152,"Like, are we the people to be able to complete this?",14,,
139,0.97,1120.152,1126.325,Next slide.,14,,
140,0.97,1126.325,1138.27,"While we heard many of the similar things we heard during the Dallas Webinar, we also heard things that were very specific to Seattle itself and the industry here.",14,,
141,0.97,1138.27,1149.448,"One of the top things was the significant changes that Seattle Nightlife and entertainment landscape had been going under, which preceded Covid.",14,,
142,0.97,1149.448,1163.228,"This wasn't just because of the loss of the Venues due to the pandemic, but there it already been a systemic loss of Venue closures, community spaces, and culture.",14,,
143,0.97,1163.228,1183.982,"We heard how in Seattle, things like day parties or House parties were a chance for community lead and community built folks could come together in performances and share experiences.",14,,
144,0.97,1183.982,1200.232,"Those had diminished and it disappeared and a lot of that had to do with Gentrification, loss of space, with people being crossed out of the city, lack of opportunities which was driving folks to other cities to pursue their careers.",14,,
145,0.97,1200.232,1209.775,We also learned that Nightlife and entertainment relationships are really reference based.,14,,
146,0.97,1209.775,1223.322,"It is about who you know . If you don't have the ability to get in on the ground floor, if you don't have the ability to network, if you don't have access to networking systems, then you are kept out.",14,,
147,0.97,1223.322,1244.076,"And then another highlight of it was due to that, there was a big opportunity and need for further industry and mentor ships to build up that networking muscle . next slide, please.",14,,
148,0.97,1244.076,1260.759,"So, we had a plan that we were going to obviously have larger conversations on this, but that raised questions for us . again, is the city right for this?",14,,
149,0.97,1260.759,1269.701,"Should we be the lead on this, or should we just be a support system that helps facilitate a conversation that comes organically?",14,,
150,0.97,1269.701,1271.336,Who should be at the table?,14,,
151,0.97,1271.336,1272.537,How do we reach them?,14,,
152,0.97,1272.537,1275.807,How do we bring them in?,14,,
153,0.97,1275.807,1284.349,"Another barrier to moving forward was we felt very, very strongly that we needed to compensate people for their time.",14,,
154,0.97,1284.349,1300.132,"If we were to be the lead, we would need to get a Facilitator from the community to lead that and we wanted to be able to pay them . There were constraints we need to identify where that money would come from and how we would identify that.",14,,
155,0.97,1300.132,1313.812,"And finally, of course because of Covid, how would we convene large groups of people during the pandemic in a way that was meaningful and allowed for a meaningful conversation?",14,,
156,0.97,1313.812,1334.299,"While we were coming to an agreement on where and how this would all happen, the Arbor fund started happening and we were being asked to submit ideas for how to use those funds and how to get them out into the community.",14,,
157,0.97,1334.299,1351.149,"Our former colleague had this idea that eventually became the shop to the beat program, which was we have these two sectors, retail businesses and musicians that have been extremely Hard- hit by the pandemic.",14,,
158,0.97,1351.149,1354.152,How do we match them together and support both at the same time?,14,,
159,0.97,1354.152,1377.743,"So, when that came out and we started exploring that, we realized this was a great opportunity to utilize some of those conversations we had originally had and some of the information that we had heard and how do we use that to inform and create this program to be as equitable as possible and to really address some of those issues?",14,,
160,0.97,1377.743,1406.004,"So, giving you a little overview on shop to the beat itself, what is it? it is a program we pay our musicians to perform live music in Nontraditional Venues, such as retail stores, gyms, coffee shops, jewelry shops, furniture stores . So, places you wouldn't be expecting a musician to be playing.",14,,
161,0.97,1406.004,1409.407,You walk in and there is somebody there in the background.,14,,
162,0.97,1409.407,1420.419,The idea here was how do we address some of these issues that we heard?,14,,
163,0.97,1420.419,1422.053,"So, addressing lack of Venues by creating new Venues.",14,,
164,0.97,1422.053,1427.359,Address a lack of access to Venues by removing that middleman and being producers ourselves and placing them in the Venues.,14,,
165,0.97,1427.359,1446.244,Provide an opportunity to the community that was lost by those parties that we had heard about by placing musicians really directly into the community and addressing issues of the ability to perform and the ability to make money.,14,,
166,0.97,1446.244,1461.66,What we did was we partnered with an organization that runs the music at the airport program that I think you might all be familiar with.,14,,
167,0.97,1461.66,1463.395,They are in a position to place musicians.,14,,
168,0.97,1463.395,1474.873,"We, the city, are paying the musicians to provide free performances for the Venues with the hope that that would drive foot traffic and drive retail sales for those businesses.",14,,
169,0.97,1474.873,1477.108,Those are the overall goals we were looking to set here.,14,,
170,0.97,1477.108,1481.98,We broke this into two programs because we wanted to be able to prove the concept.,14,,
171,0.97,1481.98,1517.115,"We did a pilot program in the holiday season, during the holiday shopping season . We had 27 participating businesses including queen care in the central district, black poppy Northwest in Ballard . We had a pretty good geographic range across the city in terms of where our businesses were and of the 27 businesses, we did have 10 located in what Oed identifies as High-Priority neighborhoods.",14,,
172,0.97,1517.115,1537.235,"We set a target of promoting and targeting Bipoc businesses and I think in looking at the program, we realized we didn't quite hit that goal and that is an area we need to improve on.",14,,
173,0.97,1537.235,1542.707,We are coming back this summer with a larger program that will continue this.,14,,
174,0.97,1542.707,1552.25,"We will use the area in between for musicians and businesses to understand what worked, what didn't work, and what we need to improve.",14,,
175,0.97,1552.25,1561.026,We did start a priority of targeting a majority of the by park Bipoc participants.,14,,
176,0.97,1561.026,1567.432,We had 60% who identified as Bipoc participating in the program.,14,,
177,0.97,1567.432,1572.971,"So, we certainly look forward to continuing this.",14,,
178,0.97,1572.971,1577.442,"As I said, this R.E.T.",14,,
179,0.97,1577.442,1589.821,"Is in progress because we look at the program and Tweak it and we look forward to coming back in the summer, Partnering.",14,,
180,0.97,1589.821,1597.629,"There was a great opportunity that was missed Partnering with other offices in the city, with the office of art and culture, or the Department of neighborhoods.",14,,
181,0.97,1597.629,1606.838,That will help us with our outreach and bring in a greater Rray of small businesses.,14,,
182,0.97,1606.838,1608.74,Next slide?,14,,
183,0.97,1608.74,1615.58,I just wanted to leave you here from a couple of quotes from our participants.,14,,
184,0.97,1615.58,1638.169,"Michaud spoke to this and also Wendy, who was super enthusiastic about the program not only for herself but in her ability to promote artists.",14,,
185,0.97,1638.169,1641.439,"She never had something like this for her business herself, so she really appreciated it.",14,,
186,0.97,1641.439,1644.209,Thank you very much for the opportunity to present on this R.E.T.,14,,
187,0.97,1644.209,1644.676,.,14,,
188,0.97,1644.676,1645.91,"Thank you, Scott.",15,,
189,0.97,1645.91,1653.818,Scott also hosted a meet and greet with the music Commission just last night.,15,,
190,0.97,1653.818,1676.574,"We heard a lot of these same themes from the folks that showed up, on how deeply impacted they have been through Covid, especially with Venues shutting down and being slow to reopen, so a program like this where we can really open doors for musicians, create that vibrancy and get those musicians paid Gigs and increasing retail sales.",15,,
191,0.97,1676.574,1685.917,"It's really smart and a good example of it generating economic activity across the city, so thanks a lot, Scott.",15,,
192,0.97,1685.917,1689.788,"Next slide, please.",15,,
193,0.97,1689.788,1706.438,"We will transition and talk a little about our Covid-19 response because this obviously was a large bulk of the work we did at Oed and there was a specific focus on racial equity for a lot of the work that we did . You can see some of the things, the activities that we did.",15,,
194,0.97,1706.438,1715.747,Then I will turn it over to Heidi hall who will talk about really innovative ways that we are getting money out on the ground to support our neighborhoods.,15,,
195,0.97,1715.747,1718.216,"Heidi, I will turn it over to you.",15,,
196,0.97,1718.216,1719.384,Great.,16,,
197,0.97,1719.384,1748.079,"Thank you . again, my name is Heidi hall from the neighborhood business district team at Oed, also known as only in Seattle . As we all know, the pandemic has been extremely disruptive with disproportionate impacts experienced in our black and indigenous communities as well as small businesses . It is well documented it nationally and was true in Seattle as well.",16,,
198,0.97,1748.079,1753.918,We have been working really closely with our partners to understand what they are experiencing in our neighborhoods.,16,,
199,0.97,1753.918,1756.688,"To me, District partners and small businesses where they are.",16,,
200,0.97,1756.688,1785.85,"This includes getting access to Ppe, being a Conduit for timely information, helping them navigate Federal and state relief resources and getting those to businesses in need . We have had deep engagement with our partners throughout the pandemic and the needs they receive in their districts and in hearing from their small business has really informed the economic neighborhood recovery fund that I want to share with you today.",16,,
201,0.97,1785.85,1796.194,This was designed to support strategies for economic recovery and was designed in a way to intentionally focus on racial equity.,16,,
202,0.97,1796.194,1803.735,"So, we invested nearly $6 million of the Federal relief funding to the neighborhood economic recovery as outlined in the Seattle rescue plan.",16,,
203,0.97,1803.735,1814.045,Investments were allocated through direct grants to neighborhood business district organizations as well as a public request for proposals to fund community driven ideas for economic recovery.,16,,
204,0.97,1814.045,1816.714,I will focus more on this.,16,,
205,0.97,1816.714,1826.024,119 proposals were received from the Rfp requesting $9 million in funding.,16,,
206,0.97,1826.024,1834.399,"We Prioritized communities most impacted by the pandemic, as I have highlighted here.",16,,
207,0.97,1834.399,1841.172,We worked with our colleagues to work on an interdepartmental data analysis which informed our equity criteria.,16,,
208,0.97,1841.172,1855.52,This overlaid things like Covid case rates and job losses with the city's recent equity index and displacement risk index as one way to identify those areas most impacted.,16,,
209,0.97,1855.52,1905.47,"We have leveraged those partnerships . a lot of the language access work we had done for pandemic response, communications to target outreach to communities most affected and we also instituted a review process that included a community review panel to bring in a broader perspective as we were evaluating the proposals . So, 25 organizations were funded through the Rfp, which represents $1.35 million . just as a quick highlight on some of the outcomes of that process, 85% of the funding was invested in our equity districts, which we use to define our high displacement risk neighborhoods, those that have been historically Redlined or that have experienced institutional racism.",16,,
210,0.97,1905.47,1937.735,"So, 52% of our Grantees are black or indigenous organizations . 28% of organizations are led by persons from other communities of color . The other investment strategy, our direct grants were another 28 grants and those Prioritized communities most impacted by the pandemic with higher direct grants awarded to our equity districts and our other districts Prioritizing outreach and support for Bipoc businesses.",16,,
211,0.97,1937.735,1955.42,"About 60% of the direct grant funds were awarded to equity districts, which was another 11 grants . Community Grantees implement a variety of activities and projects that help small businesses, communities, and local economies recover from the pandemic.",16,,
212,0.97,1955.42,1968.866,"Many of the proposed projects focus on activation and bringing foot traffic and customers into the district to support neighborhood businesses as well as public ground improvements, culturally relevant as Ms. outreach and support.",16,,
213,0.97,1968.866,1987.785,"Just as a couple of examples, we can't go through all of them now but just a couple of examples I wanted to share, the city launched a business Incubator in the arts and cultural space including a Pop- up market for Bipoc farmers.",16,,
214,0.97,1987.785,1993.591,"They are expanding the market street for eight weeks during the summer, providing outdoor seating and increased revenue for adjacent businesses.",16,,
215,0.97,1993.591,2015.179,We did find a lot of our small Bipoc businesses were not able to take advantage of some of those Street use permits . This is one example of our business districts taking elite organize these outdoor seating areas so that businesses can see some of the benefits of that and do some promotion as well.,16,,
216,0.97,2015.179,2020.618,They have a training program in partnership with the refugee program . that is one example.,16,,
217,0.97,2020.618,2036.768,"We have multiple vendor markets being supported, including retail projects focused on Showcasing and promoting the work of black artists and Bipoc business owners in the central district.",16,,
218,0.97,2036.768,2038.536,They are also pulling from Southeast Seattle as well.,16,,
219,0.97,2038.536,2052.784,"There will be multiple Activations celebrating, you know, the culture and history of the District as well as supporting ground improvements and Partnering to bring customers into the District and support local businesses.",16,,
220,0.97,2052.784,2065.763,"The way those Activations are structured and supported and promoted, really thinking about bringing in customers to the neighborhoods, supporting local businesses and helping them be more sustainable.",16,,
221,0.97,2065.763,2071.436,"And in closing, for 2022, we will partner with our Grantees to support businesses.",16,,
222,0.97,2071.436,2095.426,"There are a number of opportunities to leverage the community initiative investments including things like technical assistance, which will be rolling out now including things like commercial space assistance, financial health . also an expansion of restore . We are going through that right now, so we will present that next year.",16,,
223,0.97,2095.426,2101.799,"Yeah, a lot of good things and hopefully we can come back with our community partners to talk more about the projects and activities.",16,,
224,0.97,2101.799,2111.108,I will hand it back to director McIntyre.,16,,
225,0.97,2111.108,2111.676,"Thanks, Heidi.",17,,
226,0.97,2111.676,2124.789,"As we think about getting smarter through economic development, certainly we want to look outside of ourselves and other cities, maybe even internationally and try to steal the best ideas possible that we need to have a balance of lifting up the ideas and the thinking in our communities.",17,,
227,0.97,2124.789,2131.963,I think this Rfp is such a good example of that.,17,,
228,0.97,2131.963,2142.74,"From a city perspective, as we think about helping businesses and communities building wealth, it starts with listening and building trust.",17,,
229,0.97,2142.74,2152.35,"This Rfp, we are investing in Community-Based ideas, helping activate and generate the vibrancy.",17,,
230,0.97,2152.35,2153.317,We need more than that.,17,,
231,0.97,2153.317,2157.488,Don't be surprised if you see in the budget proposal more funding for this type of activity.,17,,
232,0.97,2157.488,2162.426,It's crucial for our neighborhoods and turning the corner from emergency relief to future prosperity to our neighborhoods.,17,,
233,0.97,2162.426,2162.894,"Thanks again, Heidi.",17,,
234,0.97,2162.894,2167.398,"Next slide, Phillip . Now we will turn to a really cool program.",17,,
235,0.97,2167.398,2174.839,This one is a perfect example of generating a Win-Win . It is our youth web design program.,17,,
236,0.97,2174.839,2180.678,We just reopened the next round for this program.,17,,
237,0.97,2180.678,2193.524,It is helping youth get new technical skills for web design and helping generate Websites for particularly for Bipoc business owners.,17,,
238,0.97,2193.524,2202.033,Anisa Khoshbakhtian from our key industries and workforce development team will talk to you about it.,17,,
239,0.97,2202.033,2205.536,I am really excited about this because it is a great example of getting a Win-Win.,17,,
240,0.97,2205.536,2207.138,"Anisa Khoshbakhtian, take it away.",17,,
241,0.97,2207.138,2208.206,Thank you.,18,,
242,0.97,2208.206,2224.388,"As director McIntyre mentioned, I am Anisa Khoshbakhtian, the creative workforce advocate on the key industries and workforce development team at Oed.",18,,
243,0.97,2224.388,2254.185,"I will start off by saying it is really no secret that this region has been greatly influenced by the global Tech industry, which is why it has been of utmost importance to invest in technology programs and efforts that are truly rooted in the local community, such as the youth web design program . This program not only teaches young people technical skills that will significantly support their career growth, but it allows them to earn money and learn at an early age that their work is really greatly valued and truly makes a difference.",18,,
244,0.97,2254.185,2268.266,"So, in late 2020, the program was piloted in partnership with the metropolitan Seattle as a reaction to two specific needs that we thought were greatly exacerbated by the pandemic.",18,,
245,0.97,2268.266,2289.82,"One, youth empowerment . youth employment opportunities for sustainable career development were greatly impacted due to the Stay-At-Home order . and second, the need for small businesses to have a web presence, especially minority owned businesses, mainly Bipoc and immigrant owned.",18,,
246,0.97,2289.82,2302.6,We know that the most marginalized Bipoc individuals and communities in the realm of workforce and small business experience a lack of opportunities.,18,,
247,0.97,2302.6,2308.272,What this program is at a high level I high school students.,18,,
248,0.97,2308.272,2317.848,"So far we have been working with high school students who most, if not all identify as African or African American.",18,,
249,0.97,2317.848,2331.862,They have been creating a professional Website for a local small business and the young people receive a Stipend for their work.,18,,
250,0.97,2331.862,2356.22,"I want to note that we also cover the expenses for the Website and the domain for a year . and this year, we are now expanding this program to professional creative's as well to support our creative Industries goals and help local creative gain gig work and this really connects to the creative's that Scott got to work with through shop to the beat.",18,,
251,0.97,2356.22,2381.212,"The goals for the youth workforce, to equip young people with Industry-Standard skills, mainly coding, Html, Java . they can earn their technical certification and they also are provided paid learning opportunity and portfolio development.",18,,
252,0.97,2381.212,2383.848,They receive skills that help them establish themselves.,18,,
253,0.97,2383.848,2390.154,A potential career in Tech or in a creative field or Entrepreneurship.,18,,
254,0.97,2390.154,2409.84,"It allows them to be empowered in their career trajectory and as I mentioned before, it also gives them leadership skills and confidence in knowing they can create something professional at a really young age.",18,,
255,0.97,2409.84,2466.497,"As I mentioned earlier, a majority of the participating students identify as black, African, and or African American and it's important for us to empower them to be competitive in career fields that Bipoc immunities are highly Underrepresented in . for the small business goals, it really is to get small businesses Online who have little to no web presence . We have been Prioritizing outreach to Bipoc small businesses, particularly those in equity districts and the goal is to support businesses with the highest Digital access barriers . for the creative professional, which I mentioned is a new addition to this program starting this upcoming Cohort, we really want to ensure we are supporting those who have no Websites or have limited web presence and we want to help them procure work.",18,,
256,0.97,2466.497,2482.58,"And some lessons learned--some challenges and lessons learned in the last two years of this program, one of the biggest ones has been outreach and case management for small businesses.",18,,
257,0.97,2482.58,2499.096,"And to address that, we recently hired a Canvasser who has been visiting Bipoc businesses, Prioritizing equity districts, and going door to door to spread word about this program and supporting business owners that have signed up and require more One-On-One support.",18,,
258,0.97,2499.096,2529.693,"We are continuing to look at ways to meet these businesses where they are at and Lastly, it's important to share that the youth web design program has received an investment, which is allowing us to scale this and add additional elements to the program such as covering the Website and domain costs for two to three years, possibly adding a social media and marketing element to it.",18,,
259,0.97,2529.693,2533.063,"We are looking at expanding this to other high schools, such as Ranier Beach high school.",18,,
260,0.97,2533.063,2552.049,"We are working with Seattle public schools to see how we can help the young people earn credits and what you can expect this year, which director McIntyre mentioned, we have a Cohort coming up in the summer and in the fall and I think that's it.",18,,
261,0.97,2552.049,2559.957,I really thank you for this opportunity to share about the web design program.,18,,
262,0.97,2559.957,2561.659,I will hand it back to director McIntyre.,18,,
263,0.97,2561.659,2571.402,"Thanks, Anisa . again, just a shining example of a win for the youth workforce development, individual access, and building trust in partnership with the urban League.",19,,
264,0.97,2571.402,2600.998,"Again, really trying to figure out how we scale these things to create more opportunities in all of those buckets . next slide please, Phillip . So, wrapping this up, our final presenter is the man who has been driving this presentation, Phillip sit, who will talk with us a little bit about some of the activation work that we did in 2021.",19,,
265,0.97,2600.998,2601.799,"Phillip, take it away.",19,,
266,0.97,2601.799,2604.435,"Thank you, director McIntyre pure good morning chair and committee members.",20,,
267,0.97,2604.435,2609.206,My slides are a reflection of the partnerships we did in 2021.,20,,
268,0.97,2609.206,2627.591,"Starting off, in collaboration with the office of culture, Department of neighborhoods, parks and others, around May and June, we started thinking about reaching the milestone of being one of the first major cities to obtain 70% vaccination rates.",20,,
269,0.97,2627.591,2639.269,Downtown was hit with a double Whammy of workforce not being present and how do we elevate people to come back to downtown and to support small businesses?,20,,
270,0.97,2639.269,2647.511,"Working with our community partners as listed here, we did a series of Activations across the downtown area.",20,,
271,0.97,2647.511,2654.785,Oed wants to elevate downtown because of the Anti-Asian bias occurring across the region and the country.,20,,
272,0.97,2654.785,2659.256,We wanted to focus on the downtown core and center city.,20,,
273,0.97,2659.256,2680.21,"Oed was Tasked to support Pioneer square . We partnered with an organization that highlights and spotlights our Bipoc small businesses across the city and as the activation was taking place, we ran promotions to highlight businesses that I would say are the hidden gems of our city.",20,,
274,0.97,2680.21,2703.233,"We were working around the clock during the pandemic and we didn't have necessarily a visible presence on Digital media, similar to what Anisa was saying . in terms of our full report on the downtown recovery activation, we had about 500 businesses that were supported directly or indirectly from campaign dollars.",20,,
275,0.97,2703.233,2709.473,80% of businesses were identified as women or minority owned.,20,,
276,0.97,2709.473,2717.181,"We regularly employed 200 Creatives in June, July, and the fall.",20,,
277,0.97,2717.181,2729.993,"90% of those creative types, going back to Scott's presentation, 90% of those that were hired were self identified as Bipoc.",20,,
278,0.97,2729.993,2744.007,"So, great set of events occurred in 2021 and as Heidi was mentioning, our neighborhood investments have started from the welcome back events in 2021.",20,,
279,0.97,2744.007,2758.622,"For our partners in South Seattle and West Seattle, they were providing neighborhood grants . It was an activation in the business corridor.",20,,
280,0.97,2758.622,2761.258,"Secondly, how were we able to do an outdoor gathering of that size?",20,,
281,0.97,2761.258,2765.462,"It's because as I mentioned, we were one of the first cities to hit the 70% vaccination rate.",20,,
282,0.97,2765.462,2790.721,"In collaboration with King County public health and the state, we recognized there were a lot of folks working two jobs that may be did not have direct access to schedule an appointment for the vaccines that were available in our region, so we were Tasked by the Mayor's office to set up 15 different vaccination Pop-Ups in neighborhoods and at events we could reach community members where they were.",20,,
283,0.97,2790.721,2804.935,"We had great Collaborations and partnerships with small businesses . in West Seattle, we gave an ice cream giveaway and we had 125 people get their Vaccinations in April and may during that Timeframe.",20,,
284,0.97,2804.935,2817.714,"You can see the image of the discount and we were able to provide ice cream for the first 50 people in the district, supporting a Bipoc ice cream shop.",20,,
285,0.97,2817.714,2835.799,"All in all, those were great events . We were able to reach community members where they were and maybe it is a farmers market, community event, or just showing up where employees were working around the clock in phase one and phase two.",20,,
286,0.97,2835.799,2845.142,"Pivoting a little bit, this was a Multi-Department initiative to Spruce up the city as we are reopening into phase four.",20,,
287,0.97,2845.142,2853.817,Oed received a portion of the funding in collaboration with Seattle public utilities and parks and S ..,20,,
288,0.97,2853.817,2861.225,"Looking through an equity lens, Oed has had a lot of capacity and they were doing a lot of big work during the pandemic.",20,,
289,0.97,2861.225,2882.946,"Most of them have some service to do pressure washing or removal . We made a decision, a strategic one to allocate some of the funding to the equity districts just so they could get some of that on their public realm . We partnered with a nonprofit called uplift Northwest.",20,,
290,0.97,2882.946,2885.182,Some of you may be familiar with that organization.,20,,
291,0.97,2885.182,2889.853,They employ folks returning back to the workforce.,20,,
292,0.97,2889.853,2903.433,We were pleased to provide allocations to uplift Northwest so they can provide clean services for this reopening period of three to four months.,20,,
293,0.97,2903.433,2908.105,This was for 18 neighborhoods outside of the Ecosystem.,20,,
294,0.97,2908.105,2918.282,"All in all, 50 individuals were paid market rate in terms of this program in order to do some of the public work.",20,,
295,0.97,2918.282,2971.702,"This is a Holistic Recap that INTERSECTS a little bit of the neighborhood investments that Heidi mentioned, the creative industry that definitely took a turn during the pandemic and in Scott's presentation and Anisa said there were small businesses that were able to Pivot because they had the capacity, but we saw a lot of small businesses where they were able to not get situated in a village where there were a lot of employees and high wage earners working from home . We have fascinating data from 2021 where some neighborhoods actually sought foot traffic increase from 2019 as were we reopening the city in Ballard as well.",20,,
296,0.97,2971.702,2979.576,"So, in closing, I will turn it back over to director McIntyre, but hopefully that gives you more layering of the recovery in 2021.",20,,
297,0.97,2979.576,2982.012,"Thanks very much, Phillip.",21,,
298,0.97,2982.012,2989.386,Next slide . We are reaching the end and then we will be happy to take some questions.,21,,
299,0.97,2989.386,2996.493,"Just to wrap it up, as I said at the top, we are trying to rethink the identity role of Oed.",21,,
300,0.97,2996.493,3013.744,We want to be seen as an Orchestrator and make sure we are trying to find ways to break down barriers and open doors to wealth building opportunities and for communities that have been excluded from such opportunities.,21,,
301,0.97,3013.744,3020.851,We will find an inclusive economy where everyone can fully participate and we are generating individual business and community wealth Holistically.,21,,
302,0.97,3020.851,3049.713,"Hopefully you have seen a clear thread through some of our work last year, centering racial equity, doing a lot of outreach to different communities and really trying to focus on where there was the deepest impact from Covid, the different industries, different Geographies, different demographics . going forward, we will make sure we set racial equity in our work as we think about economic revitalization.",21,,
303,0.97,3049.713,3055.585,"That will be a core part of our planning, not an add on, but a key part of it.",21,,
304,0.97,3055.585,3063.727,We have got to figure out how to communicate with the Storytelling but also where those opportunities are and what those programs might be.,21,,
305,0.97,3063.727,3070.4,"And finally, as I said, we are still a bit of a skeleton crew over here.",21,,
306,0.97,3070.4,3084.414,"This team did really great work last year and they are doing great work now, but as they look at the future and what we want to do, we are going to invest in our people . We have got to invest in our infrastructure and technology and in our team culture.",21,,
307,0.97,3084.414,3096.026,"We have a positive, forward thinking group of people on these issues.",21,,
308,0.97,3096.026,3100.497,"Those are a couple of things to wrap up what we did last year, and a look ahead into the future.",21,,
309,0.97,3100.497,3108.004,We will be excited to come back to the committee later on this summer and give a better explanation of our work plan and priorities and what we are trying to set up now and going forward.,21,,
310,0.97,3108.004,3111.041,Hopefully that gives you a glimpse of some of the great work this team has done.,21,,
311,0.97,3111.041,3121.384,"I want to thank Phillip, Heidi, Anisa, and Scott . There are a lot of others on the team to put in great effort as well.",21,,
312,0.97,3121.384,3124.654,"With that, we will wrap it up and see if you guys have questions or comments.",21,,
313,0.97,3124.654,3128.291,Thank you so much.,21,,
314,0.97,3128.291,3135.832,"Thank you so much, team, for outlining this.",22,,
315,0.97,3135.832,3138.268,I do look forward to future presentations.,22,,
316,0.97,3138.268,3166.496,"I just want to say that when you talk about the identity of Oed, to me, I have always believed that he, too, race and social justice is providing more opportunities for wealth generation and that could be homeownership or, you know, access to capital for business owners in Bipoc communities and any number of things.",22,,
317,0.97,3166.496,3184.147,"But basically Oed, to me, your identity is helping people to start and grow businesses in Seattle and that in and of itself is facilitating wealth generation.",22,,
318,0.97,3184.147,3204.467,"It seems what we are talking about today is in the core DNA of your Department uniquely in the city, so thank you very much for this presentation and for the work you have done in the past with everybody there at Oed and going forward.",22,,
319,0.97,3204.467,3220.317,"In my Inauguration speech, I laid out the top two priorities for my community and they were revitalizing downtown and neighborhood small business districts and preventing the displacement of minority owned businesses in communities Undergong rapid Gentrification.",22,,
320,0.97,3220.317,3230.894,"I have met with leaders of equitable community develop organizations, those that are partners in the collaborative.",22,,
321,0.97,3230.894,3282.112,"I have met with Cdf I directors and the regional director of the small business administration to figure out how we get more capital into the hands of people that have been excluded because of the fact that they don't have the equity or the property that traditional banks require for commercial loans . I am interested in Land-Use and building code changes that will make it easier for businesses that could be displaced from neighborhoods that are undergoing change, like for example when a big development comes in, perhaps it is an affordable housing project that comes in and displaces four or five storefronts or whatever.",22,,
322,0.97,3282.112,3287.951,How can we make it easier for those businesses that have been displaced to move back into those spaces and start small?,22,,
323,0.97,3287.951,3293.256,"You know, be able to grow as their business grows.",22,,
324,0.97,3293.256,3307.07,"Code changes, maybe even a program that is modeled on multi family tax exemption program . that would Incentivize building owners to cover the costs of improvements so we can keep businesses and jobs here.",22,,
325,0.97,3307.07,3320.383,"It is the core priority of mine and your Department has the know-how and historic knowledge on what needs to be done, so I look forward to working very closely with you going forward.",22,,
326,0.97,3320.383,3354.384,"And when I raised my hand earlier when you were talking about Nightlife, I just wanted to--getting back to the DOT connecting, I believe it was March or February, my office met Scott and we were talking with Dana, the owner, about how important Nightlife is not just as it supports our artists, but as job creators.",22,,
327,0.97,3354.384,3367.797,"There are so many people that enter into their professions working at music Venues, doing the lighting and sound engineering and all of that and they were talking about ways.",22,,
328,0.97,3367.797,3398.228,"I don't know, they put forward that it would be really helpful if the city could figure out how to lament a pipeline between people that are looking for well-paid jobs in our creative industries and in the owners of Venues and whatever ways that we, as a city, could serve as a Conduit for those opportunities.",22,,
329,0.97,3398.228,3399.662,I'm hoping we could talk more about that.,22,,
330,0.97,3399.662,3405.001,"Stott, Phillip, and I and Councilmember Lewis were there last night.",22,,
331,0.97,3405.001,3407.27,Thank you very much for convening that.,22,,

334,0.97,3419.582,3428.425,I expect that Oed will be involved and will look to help facilitate their priorities too.,22,,
335,0.97,3428.425,3433.296,"And finally, one last thing and then I will open it up for questions.",22,,
336,0.97,3433.296,3449.045,"When you were talking about the work you are doing with youth and Digital equity, I never knew about that program and I'm really glad to know because I was thinking, you know, what do small businesses need in this town?",22,,
337,0.97,3449.045,3450.847,What do they need that they don't have already?,22,,
338,0.97,3450.847,3451.281,A Website.,22,,
339,0.97,3451.281,3464.26,"I am really glad to hear about that work and when it comes to, you know, helping our young Creatives figure out how to make a paycheck from their art and unified outreach does just that.",22,,
340,0.97,3464.26,3482.011,They work with youth in high schools and in summer programs that basically help people think about young people and they frame their work partly as violence prevention.,22,,
341,0.97,3482.011,3491.321,"They help young people think about how they can actually break into the industries . If they are interested in Video, well, what do they need to do?",22,,
342,0.97,3491.321,3497.994,What are the steps they need to take to actually get into Professionalizing their art?,22,,

345,0.97,3513.409,3517.08,The work that you do is incredible.,23,,
346,0.97,3517.08,3530.293,It is the underpinning of so many people's success and I think you intervene and failure more often than people realize to be that safety net for businesses.,23,,
347,0.97,3530.293,3533.73,I really can't thank you enough for all of the work you have done for the pandemic.,23,,
348,0.97,3533.73,3541.905,You were crucial in making the farmers market to reopen.,23,,
349,0.97,3541.905,3553.249,"Even though people were still getting their groceries from the farmers market, that is one of countless, countless, countless numbers of ways that you have helped me, the community, and the entire city.",23,,
350,0.97,3553.249,3563.826,I haven't even started talking about my life for all that is to come as we rebuild a better Seattle because we don't need to return to the way we were.,23,,
351,0.97,3563.826,3575.071,We get to return to a place that is better than it has been before and I trust in your leadership because I see you as trusted partners.,23,,

358,0.97,3617.647,3646.209,"We know before the pandemic, the creative sector really drove a significant portion of Seattle's economy and we also know that the creative sector was among the very hardest hit by Covid and it is predicted not just specifically here in Seattle, but generally the creative sector is anticipating to recover the slowest.",25,,
359,0.97,3646.209,3659.522,"Really, again, I appreciate that focus and love that you have shared with us the North Seattle junction was among the locations that benefited from shop to the beat.",25,,
360,0.97,3659.522,3663.326,That is super exciting.,25,,
361,0.97,3663.326,3678.574,I just have questions about the data collection that you Referenced on slide 12. you wrote that the data--let's see.,25,,
362,0.97,3678.574,3708.471,"It identifies specifically a need for further awareness in Mentorships . The data shows artists interacting with Venues and Gatekeepers and sectors, business practices, and a standards . I'm wondering whether or not there is a follow-up you will be working on to address some of those issues that were identified through that data collection?",25,,
363,0.97,3708.471,3708.838,Thank you.,25,,
364,0.97,3708.838,3710.073,Thank you for the question.,26,,
365,0.97,3710.073,3722.585,"Yes, the greater conversation around the systemic issues needs to continue and that is an area we continue to want to explore.",26,,
366,0.97,3722.585,3725.621,That conversation does not end with shop to the beat by any means.,26,,
367,0.97,3725.621,3737.9,This was just being able to quickly take the information that we had received and Pivot to a program and making sure that program was developed according to what we had heard.,26,,

369,0.97,3754.25,3765.261,"Yeah, one thing I have heard from people is there are very few actual Venues for entertainment.",27,,
370,0.97,3765.261,3768.764,Caesar Robinson mentioned that to me.,27,,
371,0.97,3768.764,3776.272,Just having physical space is one key to access and breaking down the barriers.,27,,
372,0.97,3776.272,3782.712,Are there any other questions here?,27,,
373,0.97,3782.712,3797.793,"Well, that was a Teaser of a future presentation that will be coming in the committees ahead.",27,,
374,0.97,3797.793,3809.372,"I am especially looking forward to hearing how it Oed continues to Hone its identity and present your work plan, talk about industry sectors and especially continuing our conversation about how we can strengthen our film economy in Seattle.",27,,

384,0.97,3888.618,3921.317,I really do appreciate providing that Venue to talk about next steps and how those recommendations are going and conversations with the Mayor's office about new initiatives . I especially was interested in I believe Erin Goodman or don Lakeman presented the idea of Coordinators in the business districts.,31,,
385,0.97,3921.317,3939.635,I mentioned this because there is a nexus with Oed and around in general because Oed is the body of the city that supports the creation of the business improvement areas.,31,,
386,0.97,3939.635,3945.474,Make sure they're getting the support they need from the city.,31,,
