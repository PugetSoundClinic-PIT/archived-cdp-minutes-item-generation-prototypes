48,0.97,283.65,288.888,First thing we want to talk about is the individual artist grant called city artist.,22,,

50,0.97,291.457,298.431,Because we are doing the work ahead of time to make sure artists get paid right when 2023 starts.,22,,
51,0.97,298.431,304.537,So this funding cycle is for this next couple of years.,22,,

55,0.97,308.841,320.953,"What is interesting about this program and part of the innovations toward equity we have provided is it is an artist focused grant, no the a project based grant as you'll find in many individual artist spaces.",22,,
56,0.97,320.953,327.493,It is focusing on the artist and their trajectory and career.,22,,
57,0.97,327.493,330.129,"Are they an early, mid career, established?",22,,
58,0.97,330.129,348.548,"Typically the panel looks at all three and gives awards across-the-board and we, of course, try and get our awards to folks who are representing the diverse cultural landscape of Seattle and its communities.",22,,
59,0.97,348.548,350.383,Typically 200 plus applications come in.,22,,
60,0.97,350.383,358.591,24 or so awards are awarded based on that spread and we do alternating years of funding.,22,,
61,0.97,358.591,369.535,"So this year we are doing dance choreography, as well as music composition and theater and Playwrighting, in the other years we have Filmmaking and media and a few others as well.",22,,

66,0.97,382.615,388.654,"Yeah, go ahead and finish the presentation and then we'll open it up if there is questions afterwards.",24,,
67,0.97,388.654,389.889,"Beautiful, thank you.",25,,
68,0.97,389.889,390.456,All right.,26,,
69,0.97,390.456,397.196,So the next one is another opportunity for individual artists called artists up.,26,,

71,0.97,409.976,428.261,"And it is a focus on artists statewide, based on community feed each of those constituencies we move forward with this program around mentoring artists of color, mentoring other artists of color, that peer to peer mentoring is what these asked for.",26,,

74,0.97,439.038,443.576,We are excited to be able to scale up this program and have artists show up for each other.,26,,
75,0.97,443.576,445.845,We are going to be opening this twice this year.,26,,
76,0.97,445.845,449.816,The first is March 1 and the second will be in the fall.,26,,

81,0.97,472.872,475.875,This supports out of school arts time programs.,27,,
82,0.97,475.875,479.212,"You'll hear this next, we also have in school programs.",27,,

86,0.97,497.196,503.87,And then we will make decisions by the time the fall arrives.,28,,
87,0.97,503.87,509.509,"And finally, the advantage roster is open now.",29,,

96,0.97,576.142,580.346,This program is really connecting under and unemployed creative workers into the creative industries.,30,,

99,0.97,595.227,605.471,"The impact is 100 plus creative workers will be employed for up to six months and earning up to 12 Kfor that, that does not cloud for example supplies and materials.",30,,
100,0.97,605.471,611.31,That is really just the wage for the creative worker for that six months.,30,,

115,0.97,694.76,702.668,They identified a $30 million budget for recommendations to investing in the Seattle.,34,,
116,0.97,702.668,710.576,Arts of culture was awarded 2 hundred dollars in these funds so we put together a process to aware organizations that were doing the work of cultural education in our communities.,34,,
117,0.97,710.576,713.846,The first thing we do was coordinate with internal art staff.,34,,
118,0.97,713.846,723.255,"We reached out to the Seattle arts Commission, the Seattle music Commission, we circled back to EC I task force members.",34,,
119,0.97,723.255,729.095,We also engaged community members who had doesn't work with our office and we reached out to fellow city Department.,34,,
120,0.97,729.095,744.009,"And through all of this communication, we were able to identify 100 organizations that were currently providing cultural education experiences for youth in the city of Seattle.",34,,
121,0.97,744.009,767.8,"Using the criteria identified by the EC I task force, which was organizations that serve 75 of youth and organizations that had deep community connections, we were able to cut that list of 100 organizations down to 66 organizations that directly met the EC I, t Frecommendations.",34,,
122,0.97,767.8,770.703,After that we convened members from the arts community.,34,,
123,0.97,770.703,796.862,"We had a couple of community members who, for a long time, have worked in arts, both as artists and as Funders, as well as a couple EC I task force members themselves and we put them together for a selection panel and these folks came together, they did the deliberation, and they identified the organizations that would receive funding.",34,,
124,0.97,796.862,801.467,"So, in the end, our selection panel selected 29 organizations for funding.",34,,
125,0.97,801.467,819.685,"Of that $2 million we were able to award, $1.85 million, we had 12 organizations were awarded $100,000, nine organizations awarded $50,000 and eight organizations were awarded $25,000.",34,,
126,0.97,819.685,832.831,"And as you can see, this list, it is a very diverse list of organizations, and they all perform the work of cultural education in different ways.",34,,
127,0.97,832.831,843.075,"For example we have learn TV, they create Digital programming for Preschoolers, so it is basically like our own local version of sesame street.",34,,
128,0.97,843.075,846.178,We also have the Buffalo soldiers of Seattle.,34,,
129,0.97,846.178,862.027,"They take youth from urban neighborhoods in Seattle, they take them out and give them outdoor experiences, as well as experiences in cultural education and learning about the histories of the Buffalo soldiers.",34,,
130,0.97,862.027,862.695,It is a cool organization.,34,,
131,0.97,862.695,862.861,,35,,
132,0.97,862.861,868.667,And Geeking out kids of color was a new one.,36,,
133,0.97,868.667,880.913,They are an organization that teaches youth how to cope in hopes that they will be able to get jobs that would that Lou them to live in their neighborhoods when they grow up.,36,,
134,0.97,880.913,882.881,So that is what we did for 2021.,36,,
135,0.97,882.881,887.052,"Right now, you know, we did the contracts at the end of the year.",36,,
136,0.97,887.052,893.092,The organizations are doing the work right now.,36,,
137,0.97,893.092,895.694,"And we also have $500,000 to award for 2022.",36,,
138,0.97,895.694,915.581,"So we are working internally to kind of build out what that process will look like, we are engaging a lot of these organizations that you see in front of you right now, and we are going to work with community to build out another process for this $500,000 and at the end of the year, we are hoping to do another funding process.",36,,
139,0.97,915.581,930.596,"So if anyone has questions, feel free to let me know.",36,,
140,0.97,930.596,931.73,Thank you.,36,,

143,0.97,937.77,940.873,I have a few questions.,37,,
144,0.97,940.873,944.41,"Oh, I just saw director Ali Barnes.",37,,
145,0.97,944.41,948.681,"Good morning, how are you?",37,,
146,0.97,948.681,949.081,You are muted.,37,,
147,0.97,949.081,949.348,Still muted.,37,,
148,0.97,955.554,956.622,.,37,,
149,0.97,956.622,959.391,Welcome to the technology difficulties.,38,,
150,0.97,959.391,962.027,"My apologies, council member and colleagues.",38,,
151,0.97,962.027,965.464,"One of the things I wanted, Ali Barnes, acting director of the office of arts and culture.",38,,
152,0.97,965.464,984.183,One of the things I really want to emphasize in each the last piece we saw from this amazing partnerships education grants group is the cultural education grants that went out through the EC I. the staff actually did this in three weeks.,38,,
153,0.97,984.183,1002.067,"Getting that money assigned in September of 2021, it was important to get it out to the arts sector so that we knew that these 30 organizations would be able to open their doors beginning January 2022 and continue doing the work that they had been doing previously.",38,,
154,0.97,1002.067,1009.375,So the efficacy of time and people and purpose and place is really driving this group that presented this morning.,38,,
155,0.97,1009.375,1010.943,And I wanted to publicly acknowledge that.,38,,
156,0.97,1010.943,1011.844,I appreciate that.,39,,
157,0.97,1011.844,1020.586,It is good to know that when we have the right leadership we can get money out the door quickly.,39,,
158,0.97,1020.586,1021.987,That is very important.,39,,
159,0.97,1021.987,1029.194,So I have a couple of questions.,40,,
160,0.97,1029.194,1048.08,"Just for my own clarification, my understanding was that part of the selection criteria would be organizations that had, that could demonstrate some loss due to Covid?",40,,
161,0.97,1048.08,1048.714,Am I understanding that right?,40,,
162,0.97,1048.714,1053.752,"With all the Aarp pool funds the Federal guidelines will be applied, you are correct I don't okay.",41,,
163,0.97,1053.752,1055.754,I wanted to make sure I understood that.,41,,
164,0.97,1055.754,1060.459,Then my other list here of okay.,41,,
165,0.97,1060.459,1066.298,"So this is really helpful, just to show kind of the breadth of ways that we as a city are funding artists.",41,,
166,0.97,1066.298,1077.676,"I think it is important to demonstrate the different funding opportunities, you know, to show support for cultural workers, who are really contributing to the vitality of the city.",41,,
167,0.97,1077.676,1086.518,"I want to congratulate you all on getting, I have already forgotten his name, but the artist who did the Mlk mural.",41,,
168,0.97,1086.518,1088.62,Goating him up from Mexico to do those repairs.,41,,
169,0.97,1088.62,1100.332,I think that was really important and so happy to see that that is going to be repaired and that he was willing to come up and do it.,41,,
170,0.97,1100.332,1113.112,"And then I also want to acknowledge the mentoring program you are supporting, particularly now, when we are talking about people who have you know, been so acutely impacted by Covid.",42,,
171,0.97,1113.112,1127.192,"Providing support, particularly for black and Brown artists, for people artists experiencing disabilities or other kind of Underrepresented folks.",42,,
172,0.97,1127.192,1133.599,"Having that four hour mentoring opportunity to tap into and providing support for that, I think is really important.",42,,
173,0.97,1133.599,1137.87,So I just want to thank you all for the work you are doing there.,42,,
174,0.97,1137.87,1158.156,"And realizing the cultural education work, as we are talking about ethnic studies in school and really trying to address the cultural Erasure that has happened in our education system programs like this are important to make sure we are supporting young people and making sure they feel seen and are seen in our community.",42,,
175,0.97,1158.156,1164.796,So I want to thank you all for the work that you are doing.,42,,
176,0.97,1164.796,1165.464,And really appreciate that.,42,,
177,0.97,1165.464,1176.542,I did want to touch base on a couple of things we spoke about in our monthly meeting but that aren't addressed here.,42,,
178,0.97,1176.542,1197.262,"If you could provide an update on the cultural space agency PDA, and we had talked about I know you were looking for a recovery manager to coordinate with the neighborhoods and provide that sort of interdepartmental coordination.",42,,
179,0.97,1197.262,1199.097,Can you give us an update?,42,,
180,0.97,1199.097,1204.97,I can give you a very brief update.,43,,
181,0.97,1204.97,1226.291,"The cultural space agency is just again flourishing, and we were just so proud to be able to send out a contract to the agency for the base program, which really impacts so many organizations and young people and people of color who want to learn about what it takes to be Moralized and keep cultural space.",43,,
182,0.97,1226.291,1231.563,So we actually moved the base program for the PDA's contract to the PDA.,43,,
183,0.97,1231.563,1247.813,"And arts is funding that program in 2022 with $60,000 as well as a $10,000 support for a base network new Website, if you will.",43,,
184,0.97,1247.813,1259.725,"Initially we got out $500,000 to the FDA in 2021 to support the start up again, and there will be an additional $250,000 worth coming in 2022.",43,,
185,0.97,1259.725,1270.035,So it is great to put joint signatures on a letter to joint constituency about a program like base that is really important to them in that regard.,43,,
186,0.97,1270.035,1282.648,"The good news on the recovery manager is that we are now in deliberations and looking at references that we actually went through the process and Seattle human resources was so, I mean they are amazing.",44,,
187,0.97,1282.648,1286.852,How they do all of this is just kind of amazing to watch.,44,,
188,0.97,1286.852,1289.488,And we are really grateful that we have their support.,44,,
189,0.97,1289.488,1300.165,So we are well on our way into that process and will be making some other determinations shortly and will bring those to your office as well.,44,,
190,0.97,1300.165,1300.899,All right.,45,,
191,0.97,1300.899,1301.199,Thank you.,45,,
192,0.97,1301.199,1301.667,Okay.,46,,
193,0.97,1301.667,1306.838,"Colleagues, are there any questions for our friends at the arts Department?",46,,
194,0.97,1306.838,1308.807,Council member Strauss I think I saw your hand.,46,,
195,0.97,1308.807,1309.975,"Thank you, chair.",47,,

201,0.97,1337.536,1341.807,"Your work, many museums and institutions were able to receive Covid and AR P.A.",47,,
202,0.97,1341.807,1343.709,Funding and some were left out.,47,,
203,0.97,1343.709,1357.155,And I want to highlight the work director Barnes is doing right now to help me and all of us identify who those organizations were that were left out and how we can continue to support them.,47,,
204,0.97,1357.155,1357.589,So no questions.,47,,
205,0.97,1357.589,1366.098,"Just a big thank you, Kudos and keep up the great work.",47,,
206,0.97,1366.098,1366.732,Perfect.,48,,

208,0.97,1367.733,1370.969,I don't see any other questions.,49,,

210,0.97,1374.306,1384.583,And we will move onto the next agenda item.,49,,
211,0.97,1384.583,1385.45,Okay.,50,,
212,0.97,1385.45,1388.186,"Devon, could you please read item 2?",50,,

215,0.97,1399.03,1400.966,Thank you very much.,52,,
216,0.97,1400.966,1417.649,"So I want to welcome director Ali Barnes and Marissa and I want to just again state, before you get started, that we are here to shine a light on some of the mistakes that were made and to learn from them, not to point fingers.",52,,
217,0.97,1417.649,1426.625,My hope is we can look into the processes more deeply to see what changes we need to consider.,52,,
218,0.97,1426.625,1439.704,"And to just get some clarity on what happened and what we can do to talk to make sure that we are serving con stiff weather center, and especially that we are serving young people well.",52,,
219,0.97,1439.704,1449.481,"So I'm going to ask you to, I know you have a presentation.",52,,
220,0.97,1449.481,1452.25,So please go ahead.,52,,
221,0.97,1452.25,1454.019,Thank you.,53,,
222,0.97,1454.019,1459.357,"God morning, council member Morales and other distinguished Council members present today.",53,,
223,0.97,1459.357,1463.094,As you know I'm Dwayne Chapelle director here at the Department of education and early learning.,53,,
224,0.97,1463.094,1472.838,I want to thank you for this opportunity to update you on deals youth social justice led many grants.,53,,
225,0.97,1472.838,1490.755,"We are going to share as you mentioned Council member Morales, crust the challenges we face implementing this grant and how we have been able to work through them to fund all 89 youth projects, and then inform you of our next step.",53,,
226,0.97,1490.755,1503.535,So what I would like to do here is give a little background and quick background and time lines on the youth led social justice mini grant.,54,,
227,0.97,1503.535,1516.181,So this opportunity originated as a joint effort by Council and the executive office in response to hate crimes and bias incidents that was occurring in early 2021.,54,,
228,0.97,1516.181,1528.693,And to give our youth opportunities for civic engagement and leadership on topics that they are deeply passionate about.,54,,
229,0.97,1528.693,1539.037,"Our youth had the autonomy to develop their own projects, and we set award amounts ranging from 500 to $8000 per applicant.",54,,
230,0.97,1539.037,1549.314,"What you'll see here is this Slideshow shows the initial considerations that went into the design of the grant, and really guided deals, internal processes.",54,,
231,0.97,1549.314,1566.698,You can also know this a lot of intention in the and youth engagement actually went into this design and how we can make this the best possible experience for our young scholars.,54,,
232,0.97,1566.698,1579.411,"And through a series of virtual meetings, we had internal work groups that engaged the Seattle youth Commission and youth interns to really Co-Design this opportunity.",54,,
233,0.97,1579.411,1593.058,There was a public survey that was conducted for you to find out more about their interests and accessibility needs.,54,,
234,0.97,1593.058,1617.082,"About Maria feedback we designed the application process to Conassist of a short three page application accepting both written and video submissions, and the application included questions asking youth to basically just describe the intended impacts of their projects and how their proposals would be Covid safe.",54,,
235,0.97,1617.082,1633.131,"Our intent really ultimately was for it to be youth friendly, low barrier and noncompetitive.",54,,
236,0.97,1633.131,1637.268,"So now what this slide provides, ultimately, is just an Overvow of the grant Timeline.",55,,
237,0.97,1637.268,1641.94,So I mentioned this a moment ago.,55,,
238,0.97,1641.94,1649.681,So the summer of 2021 was all about youth engagement.,55,,
239,0.97,1649.681,1657.956,"The grant was released in September, followed by the Covid stay virtual information and technical assistance sessions.",55,,
240,0.97,1657.956,1672.303,"The applications were due on October 25, and the application review period required an extension of the Timeline and was completed in January.",55,,
241,0.97,1672.303,1681.179,On February 1 we issued a miscommunication to an Cants about awards which we will cover in detail in just a moment.,56,,
242,0.97,1681.179,1694.325,"Our message, it caused confusion amongst applicants, and we knew we had to act quickly to address this error.",56,,
243,0.97,1694.325,1708.907,So we promptly consulted with the Mayor who directed to issue a new statement with the commitment to fully funding the applicants or fully funding all applicants after learning about them.,56,,
244,0.97,1708.907,1732.23,"So on February 7, all applicants were notified that they would receive full funding for their proposals, and what I'm going to do now is, I would like to invite Marissa, she is our interim director of policy and communications, to discuss our process for notifying applicants.",56,,
245,0.97,1732.23,1732.597,Thank you.,57,,
246,0.97,1732.597,1736.868,I'll share a few slides just about the internal process of the application.,57,,
247,0.97,1736.868,1745.777,What you see on this slide is the Timeline of applicant notification that occurred starting last week.,57,,
248,0.97,1745.777,1755.72,"For this process, and as a standard per deal we issued a standard E-mail notification informing applicants of their fund ago wards.",57,,
249,0.97,1755.72,1763.061,Last Tuesday was when this miscommunication occurred where all applicants were informed that they would be funded.,57,,
250,0.97,1763.061,1765.73,Can then we retracted that E- mail and issued directed information.,57,,
251,0.97,1765.73,1786.384,"What we heard from community as well, of course, with his the confusion this caused, the burden it policed on adult allies and fiscal sponsors to help these understand what they were reading from a city led process and therefore we need some Pivots in how we are approaching communication moving forward.",57,,
252,0.97,1786.384,1796.227,"So on Monday director Chapelle issued a Video statement we sent to an can't by E-mail, trying to take a more relation al and personal approach to our communication with them.",57,,
253,0.97,1796.227,1814.712,And our staff have started making individual phone calls to all of the applicants to first make sure that they received director Chapelle's Video and that they understand that it means that funding has been made available to support their projects.,57,,
254,0.97,1814.712,1836.668,And we are also confirming the information in their applications with regard to the amount of funds requested and clarifying if they have a fiscal sponsor or if they still need to have a fiscal sponsor identified.,57,,
255,0.97,1836.668,1847.579,"As part of the original grant release, we had a selection process identified in that application and that is reflected on your slide in this purple table.",58,,
256,0.97,1847.579,1853.484,"When we sent the E-mail to an can't last week, we informed them that this table was not used.",58,,
257,0.97,1853.484,1857.589,And that the department had moved to a random selection process.,58,,
258,0.97,1857.589,1872.637,"So I just want to briefly touch on why we made that change, as well as remind Council identifying of these processes is currently used and still has made the commitment to support All-Pro Gentex.",58,,
259,0.97,1872.637,1897.629,"So our initial intent with this was to Prioritize our limited $100,000 in funding to communities most impacted biracial hate and bias, as well as to direct resources to address root causes of those acts.",58,,
260,0.97,1897.629,1907.905,"And what we found, when we applied this rubric, we did have more than 50 applications who received the maximum points.",58,,
261,0.97,1907.905,1912.41,So our rubric did not work as designed.,58,,
262,0.97,1912.41,1929.994,Therefore we Pivoted to randomization which we internally discussed and found to be the most equitable approach given there was not variation in the points award and that we wanted to maintain our commitment to a youth friendly inclusive and noncompetitive process.,59,,
263,0.97,1929.994,1934.699,So again this random selection was what was in that February 1 communication.,59,,
264,0.97,1934.699,1946.911,"Which we have now creaked with the Video commitment to all applicants, indicating that they will receive funding.",59,,
265,0.97,1946.911,1950.581,A little bit about our applicants.,60,,
266,0.97,1950.581,1953.117,The majority were ages 14 to 17.,60,,
267,0.97,1953.117,1959.991,And we were also really excited to see 15% of applicants were ages 1 to 13.,60,,
268,0.97,1959.991,1969.033,"The majority did identify a fiscal sponsor in their application, and at that time around 20% also said they did not have a fiscal sponsor.",60,,
269,0.97,1969.033,1976.074,So later in the presentation we'll talk about the support the Department will be providing in the space.,60,,
270,0.97,1976.074,1992.023,And then as director Chapelle mentioned we did allow Video submission and it was great to see 20% of applicants chose to apply in that format.,60,,
271,0.97,1992.023,1992.457,Director Chapelle?,60,,
272,0.97,1992.457,1993.591,"Yes, thank you.",61,,
273,0.97,1993.591,1994.125,"Thank you, Marissa.",61,,
274,0.97,1994.125,2008.206,"So as I mentioned earlier, I just want to make sure I say that you know, I deeply regret the mistake that our team made with the initial notification.",61,,
275,0.97,2008.206,2024.589,"As a father of four amazing children and a former teacher who has taught hundreds and thousands of children, I know that we must teacher and principal, we must do better by our young scholars.",61,,
276,0.97,2024.589,2025.089,They are our leaders.,61,,
277,0.97,2025.089,2034.365,"Working with the Mayor, we have collaborated to identify a path forward that is in the best interest of our dedicated young leaders.",62,,
278,0.97,2034.365,2044.108,"And I am like so excited that we will now be funding All-Pro Gentex with over $525,000.",62,,
279,0.97,2044.108,2066.898,"And I'm just proud of our city's excitement to continue, just our commitment to investing in our youth, to advance racial justice and inclusion and this grant truly celebrates them and shines a positive light on all of our communities.",62,,
280,0.97,2066.898,2074.972,"The initial $100,000 comes from the 25, 2021, and the additional funds comes from the projected 2021 savings in K-12.",62,,
281,0.97,2074.972,2082.98,You will get a chance to see this reflected in a carry forward request as part of the regular process.,62,,
282,0.97,2082.98,2089.454,There is no anticipated impacts to other programs at all.,62,,
283,0.97,2089.454,2106.471,"And are you, they really propose the diverse range of brilliant ideas, just advocating for social justice and up resisting their communities through art, as we heard arts present, right?",62,,
284,0.97,2106.471,2110.041,"Music, student conferences, community conversations and meaning more.",62,,
285,0.97,2110.041,2113.945,Their leadership is invaluable in speaking out against hate and biases.,62,,
286,0.97,2113.945,2126.29,And it is just important early this supported and included in our city strategy to address these urgent issues.,62,,
287,0.97,2126.29,2136.234,"So what I'm going to do now is, is talk about next steps between like February and March.",63,,
288,0.97,2136.234,2141.973,So this was and Conges to be a learning process for us.,63,,
289,0.97,2141.973,2148.546,"Although this has been challenging, we are improving our processes, and he will be better for it.",63,,
290,0.97,2148.546,2159.123,"Right now, we are working on creating opportunities for the young people to share how they want to be supported in this grant going forward.",63,,
291,0.97,2159.123,2162.293,And provide honest input about their experience.,63,,
292,0.97,2162.293,2168.966,"And then from there, we'll be learning from our youth, and we'll be, should I say learning from our youth.",63,,
293,0.97,2168.966,2174.138,It will be central to how we move forward.,63,,
294,0.97,2174.138,2177.642,Just build stronger relationships within the community.,63,,
295,0.97,2177.642,2185.149,We will be also working with the fiscal sponsors of each project to complete all paperwork required to issue the Abar.,63,,
296,0.97,2185.149,2194.892,"If we learn the youths do not have fiscal sponsors, we are working with them to help find one.",63,,
297,0.97,2194.892,2212.51,"We also just remain committed to supporting our young scholars on this very important project, just to ensure that they have a positive experience and that they are successful in what they have set out to do.",64,,
298,0.97,2212.51,2222.62,"So, as we move forward, it is possible that new challenges may arise.",65,,
299,0.97,2222.62,2227.158,"Or, they may need additional support in ways not wet identified.",65,,
300,0.97,2227.158,2231.896,But we are committed to supporting our scholars the best that we can.,65,,
301,0.97,2231.896,2244.976,"Today my team, we will begin making individual phone calls to an Cants, just to confirm details of their projects, their project proposals and inquire about the support needed.",65,,
302,0.97,2244.976,2255.219,And we ultimately intend to develop just support of resources they may need based on their feedback.,65,,
303,0.97,2255.219,2266.297,"And I also, before we close this, you can go, what I wanted to do is just really just provide some, just?",66,,
304,0.97,2266.297,2268.966,Some primary initial reflections.,66,,
305,0.97,2268.966,2275.339,We are implementing protocols now to prevent the risk of another error like this in the future.,66,,
306,0.97,2275.339,2285.683,We are putting some additional internal systems in place just to check for accuracy when it comes to communicating with our grant applicants.,66,,
307,0.97,2285.683,2300.564,And another reflection that we have learned is that we learned just that the adults in our community organizations and schools who support our scholars are key allies in this work.,66,,
308,0.97,2300.564,2308.339,"And they should have the opportunity to inform if are you facing opportunities in addition to you know, the youth themselves.",66,,
309,0.97,2308.339,2329.126,"And I would say the last thing that I would like to share is that we also learned the fiscal sponsor should be secured early on, to guarantee all youth applicants will meet the grant requirements in a timely manner.",66,,
310,0.97,2329.126,2334.532,I wanted to shear that with the committee.,66,,
311,0.97,2334.532,2352.049,"And so, as we stated earlier, we are exited that this process is ultimately resulting in being able to serve and positively impact those individuals who we have all committed our lives to serving.",67,,
312,0.97,2352.049,2362.76,"And we look forward to sharing more with you about the funded projects in the coming months, as we continue to celebrate these young scholars for their social justice work that they are doing.",67,,
313,0.97,2362.76,2366.063,So want to just again thank you for your time.,67,,
314,0.97,2366.063,2371.168,"We are excited, I'm excited for what is to come.",67,,
315,0.97,2371.168,2377.842,And if questions are needed we'll take questions if you have them.,67,,
316,0.97,2377.842,2383.481,And then I will pass it over to chief Emory.,67,,
317,0.97,2383.481,2384.048,Thank you.,68,,
318,0.97,2384.048,2390.554,I just want to take a moment Council member Morales to thank you for having me in this space.,68,,
319,0.97,2390.554,2399.897,"And I'm just here to echo the messages from both Dr. Chapelle and Marissa, that we will make it right if those kids.",68,,
320,0.97,2399.897,2403.267,Kids' voices are what centers us and we are going to celebrate it.,68,,
321,0.97,2403.267,2420.284,"And from our space, we are going to make sure that deal is supported in rolling this process out and will continue to monitor and make this be a success story for our kids.",68,,
322,0.97,2420.284,2422.386,So thank you.,68,,
323,0.97,2422.386,2422.753,Thank you.,69,,
324,0.97,2422.753,2428.058,"Thank you, also Marissa and Dr.",69,,
325,0.97,2428.058,2428.325,Chapelle.,69,,
326,0.97,2428.325,2433.23,I do have several questions.,69,,
327,0.97,2433.23,2442.206,"So Maybe I will start so you talked a little bit about the Co-Creationof the R P, itself.",69,,
328,0.97,2442.206,2456.554,"Ening what I heard you say at the very end was that maybe the youth advocates or the adults organizations weren't as involved, and that might have helped create some of the challenge?",69,,
329,0.97,2456.554,2456.821,Is that?,69,,
330,0.97,2456.821,2458.989,Did I hear that right?,69,,
331,0.97,2458.989,2480.377,"What I was saying was more so, so as we were developing this, we know that like adult youth yes, they, so there was like a component of like we learned for example as I mentioned about fiscal sponsors should be secured early on to make sure that our youth you know, applicants, can have access to those.",70,,
332,0.97,2480.377,2491.655,"So just using that for an example, that is just an example of something as we are continuously improving.",70,,
333,0.97,2491.655,2493.457,We just learned about that.,70,,
334,0.97,2493.457,2495.092,Something we learned from it.,70,,
335,0.97,2495.092,2499.396,Marissa please feel free to add more if I loaf anything out.,70,,
336,0.97,2499.396,2502.933,So I want to go to slide 5.,71,,
337,0.97,2502.933,2507.404,And talk a little bit about the selection process.,71,,
338,0.97,2507.404,2511.108,So you explained why you switched to the lottery system.,71,,
339,0.97,2511.108,2521.218,"It sounds like the rubric you had designed, the intent of which was to help you Prioritize, didn't actually work.",71,,
340,0.97,2521.218,2524.421,And so that explains why you made that shift.,71,,
341,0.97,2524.421,2531.228,But can you talk a little bit about how that was explained to the recipients?,71,,
342,0.97,2531.228,2541.105,Because that was another issue that I heard is people were frustrated that it seemed to them things sort of shifted midstream and they weren't aware of that.,71,,
343,0.97,2541.105,2542.84,"Yes, thank you.",72,,
344,0.97,2542.84,2545.576,We heard that feedback as well.,72,,
345,0.97,2545.576,2551.548,"So, last week, the change was included in the E-mail notification to an Cants.",72,,
346,0.97,2551.548,2556.82,So that was how they were informed of the change in design.,72,,
347,0.97,2556.82,2564.695,"So that cadence and format communicating a change in process is something we'll be looking at further and Brainstorming alternative approaches to, moving forward.",72,,
348,0.97,2564.695,2579.61,"I don't and in terms of the design itself, I looked at that rubric and I had questions.",72,,
349,0.97,2579.61,2581.812,"So for example, how points were allocated by district.",72,,
350,0.97,2581.812,2596.894,"When I think about sort of the areas that with for example low, that had been identified as areas high risk for displacement, low economic opportunity, it is usually kind of North and South Seattle.",72,,
351,0.97,2596.894,2598.696,"You know, D5 and D2.",72,,
352,0.97,2598.696,2606.704,"So I was surprised to see D5 ranked lower, if you will.",72,,
353,0.97,2606.704,2625.289,"Another question I had about the rating is how you could rate based on inner section all Thety, rather than Prioritizing race over for example, Lgbtq status, if there was a way to blend those two.",72,,
354,0.97,2625.289,2629.56,Because we know many people struggle navigating multiple identities.,72,,
355,0.97,2629.56,2634.765,"So you know, clearly the way it was designed, you are understanding now wasn't quite right.",72,,
356,0.97,2634.765,2645.075,And I don't know how you go about fixing that or if you'll just choose a different kind of selection criteria or ranking criteria.,72,,
357,0.97,2645.075,2653.517,"But I wonder if you have any thoughts about, what about that design process didn't work?",72,,
358,0.97,2653.517,2653.884,Thank you.,73,,
359,0.97,2653.884,2654.051,Ia.,73,,
360,0.97,2654.051,2663.961,Your reflections are similar to what we have learned internally certainly.,73,,
361,0.97,2663.961,2666.83,The issue of intersection in Thety was very present.,73,,
362,0.97,2666.83,2670.134,Their understanding of the issues our city faces.,73,,
363,0.97,2670.134,2678.675,"So no surprise from them there, but we did not anticipate that in this rubric and that is part of why it did not work.",73,,
364,0.97,2678.675,2694.058,"Moving forward, if deal were to do this again, another piece of feedback we received is that our intention to have a noncompetitive process actually doesn't Resonate with many of the young people we have heard from.",74,,
365,0.97,2694.058,2703.267,So they felt like that undermines the value and the intention in the they put into their proposals.,74,,
366,0.97,2703.267,2706.236,Perhaps it does need to be competitive.,74,,
367,0.97,2706.236,2713.343,Perhaps it would need a panel of reviewers looking at the applications.,74,,
368,0.97,2713.343,2719.717,Our intention was to not be Ageist in having adult staff reviewing the applications for quality.,74,,
369,0.97,2719.717,2733.197,"But again, we are just learning a lot about how our intention Mismatched with the needs of youth and we are sincerely eager to look at that more and find out how we could better meet their needs moving forward.",74,,
370,0.97,2733.197,2733.464,Okay.,75,,
371,0.97,2733.464,2733.764,Thank you.,75,,
372,0.97,2733.764,2754.718,"So that, I was going to go to slide 6, but that point last point you made takes me to slide 7. which is that one of the categories of applicants you identify as 12 to 13-Year- olds, which is really cool to know that our 12 and 13-Year- olds are applying for grants.",76,,
373,0.97,2754.718,2763.36,"But it does make me wonder about how they were sort of educated about things like fiscal sponsorship, you know.",76,,
374,0.97,2763.36,2769.032,My guess is not many 12-Year- olds have a fiscal sponsor.,76,,
375,0.97,2769.032,2775.038,"So, when you talk about being technically Compliant with the grant, is that, it seems that was part of the issue?",76,,
376,0.97,2775.038,2777.841,That they didn't have a sponsor identified.,76,,
377,0.97,2777.841,2784.081,And I'm wondering if it was mostly the younger set who didn't have that?,76,,
378,0.97,2784.081,2788.118,Or do we know why they didn't have a sponsor identified?,76,,
379,0.97,2788.118,2794.491,I don't have the data in front of me at this time.,77,,
380,0.97,2794.491,2795.526,I could get it.,77,,
381,0.97,2795.526,2801.465,My reflection is that we did see applicants without a fiscal sponsor in all age ranges.,77,,
382,0.97,2801.465,2805.335,"For the younger applicants, many did apply as part of a school.",77,,
383,0.97,2805.335,2810.841,And so there had been teachers reaching out to deal to help those younger applicants understand our communications.,77,,
384,0.97,2810.841,2831.962,"So that is part of the intent of this next round of phone calls is to get clear about if someone had a fiscal sponsor or not, if they have a fiscal sponsor, who that is, and so that deal can identify the adult allies helping the applicants, so that moving forward, we can communicate with both the adults and the fiscal sponsor together.",77,,
385,0.97,2831.962,2838.202,I'm sorry both the youth and the fiscal sponsor together.,77,,
386,0.97,2838.202,2840.137,Okay.,78,,
387,0.97,2840.137,2851.915,"So, going back to slide 6, the funding decision effective February 8. so 525 clouds.",78,,
388,0.97,2851.915,2857.788,"You said $100,000 was?",78,,
389,0.97,2857.788,2862.359,"Yes, $100,000 was initially from the yes K-12.",79,,
390,0.97,2862.359,2862.96,K-12 funding?,80,,
391,0.97,2862.96,2863.26,Uh-huh.,81,,
392,0.97,2863.26,2868.765,So all of it is actually coming from K-12 funding?,82,,
393,0.97,2868.765,2870.133,"Yes, it is.",83,,
394,0.97,2870.133,2874.037,"But $425,000 is carry over from last year.",84,,
395,0.97,2874.037,2881.211,So I'm glad to know that we can actually fund all of these students who worked really hard to get this done.,84,,
396,0.97,2881.211,2888.785,It does raise another question for me about why we had so much unspent funding last year in this program.,84,,
397,0.97,2888.785,2892.389,But Maybe we can talk about that later.,84,,
398,0.97,2892.389,2909.606,"So just wanted to make sure I understood where the money was coming from, to be able to do this.",84,,
399,0.97,2909.606,2924.855,"It seems like communication challenges between sponsors and the Department are being worked out and I'm glad to know that you know, our adult allies are willing to make sure that young people are understanding better what processes are needed in order to them to participate in these kind of grants.",84,,
400,0.97,2924.855,2934.598,"I do think I want to add to the last, well slide 10, the kind of process check.",85,,
401,0.97,2934.598,2955.052,"Some parameters maybe on when it is okay to change a selection criteria, you know, I would say not after putting in writing that things are going to be graded judged one way.",85,,
402,0.97,2955.052,2964.528,"And Yeah, and I think maybe, I haven't read all of the materials that were shared with young people about how these processes work.",85,,
403,0.97,2964.528,2972.936,"But you know, how we explain in Nontechnical language about all of the requirements is obviously something I'm sure you are already considering.",85,,
404,0.97,2972.936,2973.203,Okay.,86,,
405,0.97,2973.203,2977.14,I want to thank you all.,86,,
406,0.97,2977.14,2988.385,"And see if my colleagues have any questions for our folks from deal and Oh, council member Strauss, please.",86,,
407,0.97,2988.385,2990.32,"Thank you, chair.",87,,
408,0.97,2990.32,2993.09,And thank you Dr. Chapelle and Marissa.,87,,
409,0.97,2993.09,2994.391,"Look, we are all human.",87,,
410,0.97,2994.391,2996.727,"We make mistakes, things happen.",87,,
411,0.97,2996.727,3008.972,"I think that what you demonstrated today what you showed on the how you reacted to making a human mistake demonstrates leadership, it demonstrates your leadership and why people continue and I still have trust in you.",87,,
412,0.97,3008.972,3017.08,"Because so many people when they make a mistake try to hide it, put it under the rug, fix it, make sure nobody notes tis and moves on.",87,,
413,0.97,3017.08,3023.186,"It takes real leadership to confront it head on, speak directly to people, make the change and move forward.",87,,
414,0.97,3023.186,3030.46,"So doing so in the light rather than trying to hide in the dark, it just continues to demonstrate why so many people on our city trust you.",87,,
415,0.97,3030.46,3035.298,"So thank you to your team, thank you to you.",87,,
416,0.97,3035.298,3037.0,Let's keep doing good work.,87,,
417,0.97,3037.0,3037.667,Thank you.,88,,
418,0.97,3037.667,3043.006,Thanks Council member Strauss.,89,,
419,0.97,3043.006,3043.306,Sorry.,90,,
420,0.97,3043.306,3044.775,I do have one more question.,90,,
421,0.97,3044.775,3048.779,I don't think this is necessarily one time funding.,90,,
422,0.97,3048.779,3057.821,But can you talk about how and whether there may be other opportunities for this kind of youth led grant?,90,,
423,0.97,3057.821,3060.557,"So, I didn't mean to cut you off.",91,,
424,0.97,3060.557,3062.893,What were you saying the last part?,91,,
425,0.97,3062.893,3067.13,I'm just curious about if this is kind of a pilot?,92,,
426,0.97,3067.13,3071.768,"A one time opportunity, or if this is something that you anticipate being able to do again and.",92,,
427,0.97,3071.768,3073.503,"Yes, it was a one time opportunity.",93,,
428,0.97,3073.503,3078.175,First time that we have done something like this.,93,,
429,0.97,3078.175,3081.812,And we didn't and don't have any plans in the future to do anything like this.,93,,
430,0.97,3081.812,3086.883,This is why it is so important that we get it right.,93,,
431,0.97,3086.883,3093.356,Because we are committed to just operational excellence and excellence for our scholars.,93,,
432,0.97,3093.356,3098.595,So yes this was a one time opportunity.,93,,
433,0.97,3098.595,3098.862,Okay.,94,,
434,0.97,3098.862,3099.062,Okay.,94,,
435,0.97,3099.062,3100.43,Well thank you very much.,94,,
436,0.97,3100.43,3117.047,"I'm glad we have found a way to support the students, the young people and I really do appreciate that you are here to help answer questions and clarify for our community what happened and how we are going to resolve it.",94,,
437,0.97,3117.047,3121.284,So thank you all.,94,,
438,0.97,3121.284,3125.589,Thank you for being here.,94,,

471,0.97,3273.603,3281.478,So the first person I would like it talk about today for her reappointment is Julia.,105,,
472,0.97,3281.478,3295.091,"Julia started off on the Commission as the only chair voted into office last year, and led the Commission into this year until two were voted at the retreat that we had a couple of weeks ago.",105,,
