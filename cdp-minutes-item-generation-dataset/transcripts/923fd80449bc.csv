182,0.97,1243.141,1249.681,"Steve works with many different departments, especially city light, to bring good jobs.",33,,
183,0.97,1249.681,1256.488,"And he's been a true asset on the board, and we forward to his continued participation.",33,,
184,0.97,1256.488,1264.796,And I think that is it for our appointments and Reappointments.,33,,
185,0.97,1264.796,1265.864,"Thank you, Sara.",34,,
186,0.97,1265.864,1281.613,Thank you to all the potential appointees who have been present here and who are adding their thoughts ..,34,,
187,0.97,1281.613,1302.734,"We'll first thank you that have been serving already, and those who have been willing to get on this Union deal oversight board.",34,,
188,0.97,1302.734,1321.019,I also wanted to thank you for advocating and making sure we have indigenous representation.,34,,
189,0.97,1321.019,1339.471,"That you think, Nina: that's why the green new deal oversight board is so important, because any of you bring a lot of specific expertise, not only community voices in general, which is absolutely important, but specific expertise.",34,,
190,0.97,1339.471,1352.351,"For example, Nina agreed to be on the board because emissions are an important component.",34,,
191,0.97,1352.351,1385.751,"From may 12th of last year, I've mentioned this many times here: Seattle residents are responsible for more than a third of the greenhouse gas emissions and rising according to the most greenhouse gas investor, missions in buildings increased 8% between 2016 and 2018, driven by burning fossil fuels like gas and oil for heat, hot water and cooking.",34,,
192,0.97,1385.751,1386.518,That's from the office's Blog.,34,,
193,0.97,1386.518,1399.364,"The reason I bring this up, because I wanted to try a general question on the appointees if you want to respond to it.",34,,
194,0.97,1399.364,1409.808,"But the question I'm asking is, it's really an observation, that the urgency is just enormous.",34,,
195,0.97,1409.808,1415.113,"I mean, you can't possibly overstate the threat that the planet is facing.",34,,
196,0.97,1415.113,1425.524,"The most recent report on the Ipcc, environmental panel on climate change, once again gives new dire statistics.",34,,
197,0.97,1425.524,1434.432,These have become more and more dire with every new study that we get.,34,,
198,0.97,1434.432,1437.302,And things are not going in the correct direction.,34,,
199,0.97,1437.302,1440.539,Seattle is a Microsoft for what's happening globally.,34,,
200,0.97,1440.539,1449.681,"Things are going in the opposite direction and it's concerning, just really dangerous.",34,,
201,0.97,1449.681,1454.553,And the Statistic on building emissions is just one example.,34,,
202,0.97,1454.553,1457.756,It should be decreasing but they have increased in the last few years.,34,,
203,0.97,1457.756,1461.793,So how do you see your role in shaking things up?,34,,
204,0.97,1461.793,1473.138,"It's no longer a question of, are you giving these statistics to elected representatives and saying, do something about it?",34,,
205,0.97,1473.138,1474.105,It's a political question.,34,,
206,0.97,1474.105,1482.981,"How do you shake things up to make governments like Seattle, globally, nationally actually act on this?",34,,
207,0.97,1482.981,1504.469,Really it's a question of putting political pressure and how do you see the green new deal oversight board playing a role in that direction?,34,,
208,0.97,1506.438,1506.972,"Go ahead, Ken.",35,,
209,0.97,1506.972,1510.475,That's a very good question.,36,,
210,0.97,1510.475,1511.576,From a lay.,36,,
211,0.97,1511.576,1515.947,", I talk about trees a lot.",36,,
212,0.97,1515.947,1528.593,"We know that through science, that the DNA of those living things, the biological material, it ends up in the ground and in the soil then eventually in trees.",36,,
213,0.97,1528.593,1533.298,So we also no that large trees have large amounts of carbon.,36,,
214,0.97,1533.298,1546.678,"This is not the cure for reducing carbon, but this is a way carbon can be sequestered and we recognize our ancient ones are in the trees at a molecular level.",36,,
215,0.97,1546.678,1566.731,"So really if we can just remind people that the part of the planet, not separate from it, that might be enough to say where people will take care of the planet earth a little bit better.",36,,
216,0.97,1566.731,1567.065,So thank you.,36,,
217,0.97,1567.065,1567.332,Nina?,37,,
218,0.97,1567.332,1571.937,"Thank you so much, Councilmember for your question.",38,,
219,0.97,1571.937,1578.777,I would like to thank Ken for your Inas well as your information.,38,,
220,0.97,1578.777,1596.027,And I want to mention that currently the Washington state technical advisor group are meeting to approve amendments to help inform what new construction and buildings will be built.,38,,
221,0.97,1596.027,1604.636,"You have an extremely important point, that most of our buildings are accountable for 30% to 40% of greenhouse gas emissions.",38,,
222,0.97,1604.636,1640.638,"I'm hoping the green new deal board with expertise from local community members, team up with green building experts and expand programs like the priority green incentives that are already in place in the city of Seattle . and you pose the question, how do you see your role in shaking things up?",38,,
223,0.97,1640.638,1646.711,I'm hoping to bridge the gap between those two entities.,38,,
224,0.97,1646.711,1670.869,"Folks struggling to gain access to affordable housing and also this labyrinth of fantastic green builders we have locally here in Washington state, in fact the Department of energy housing awards, out of all those awards that were provided, 30% were won by local builders here in Seattle.",38,,
225,0.97,1670.869,1701.9,We have all the Resourcers and builders that I look forward to bridging together with the expertise of our communities most impacted by climate change and the expertise of the green builders and Remodelers.,38,,
226,0.97,1701.9,1705.97,Anyoning buildings in the city are taxing the greenhouse gas emissions.,38,,
227,0.97,1705.97,1714.746,"Thank you so much, I look forward to discussing this more with our team and our awesome green new deal oversight board.",38,,
228,0.97,1714.813,1717.248,Hanks.,38,,
229,0.97,1717.248,1719.05,Thank you so much.,39,,
230,0.97,1719.05,1720.385,We appreciate your responses.,39,,
231,0.97,1720.385,1738.336,"Just to note a couple things quickly before I turn it over to other Councilmembers, Nina, I appreciate you noting that affordable housing is very much a key component of the against climate change and the fight for climate justice as well.",39,,
232,0.97,1738.336,1750.849,"At the same time we are fighting to save the planet, so many of our fellow community members are struggling just to have a roof over their head, let alone in an affordable manner.",39,,
233,0.97,1750.849,1757.889,"And a point Kim made earlier, the question of the jobs, jobs, jobs.",39,,
234,0.97,1757.889,1774.639,"That's crucial if we are to have any success in building the city wide, nationwide and global movement, successful movement in saving the planet.",39,,
235,0.97,1774.639,1777.442,There are no jobs on a dead planet.,39,,
236,0.97,1777.442,1804.102,"On the other hand, there's no hope of building a unified movement unless we clarify that this will mean ease to Prioritize Union living wage jobs, especially for those already in the fossil fuel sector and make developing a clean energy sector would imply Union living wage jobs.",39,,
237,0.97,1804.102,1816.514,"That's something we have to fight for specifically, and we are going to bring many working people in.",39,,
238,0.97,1816.514,1818.716,Actually jobs and the planet go together.,39,,
239,0.97,1818.716,1820.785,We have both or neither.,39,,
240,0.97,1820.785,1823.888,It's a question of which direction society head.,39,,
241,0.97,1823.888,1843.608,"That's why it's crucial the green new deal oversight board has representation from environmental rights, immigrant rights and the labor Union.",39,,
242,0.97,1843.608,1849.714,Do any other Councilmembers have any other questions?,39,,
243,0.97,1849.714,1852.217,I don't see any hands raised.,39,,
244,0.97,1852.217,1870.735,"I ask one last question before we go to the vote, which is, to fund a new deal large scale public investment in green infrastructure, we will need revenues.",39,,
245,0.97,1870.735,1874.672,"That's where the rubber meets the road, so to say.",39,,
246,0.97,1874.672,1887.885,You don't need to be willing to have more policies and taxes.,39,,
247,0.97,1887.885,1906.437,Do any of the appointees have anything to say about what this could play to fight for taxing big business in order to raise revenues for green infrastructure?,39,,
248,0.97,1906.437,1906.804,"Okay, go ahead.",39,,
249,0.97,1906.804,1909.874,Thank you so much for the question.,40,,
250,0.97,1909.874,1941.472,"I think the way to address that issue would be to actually involve the voters and the communities on the issue in hand, because a lot of people are usually opposed to raising taxes on Congresses . We have to inform the community why we are doing this and get this so we can provide our communities what they need.",40,,
251,0.97,1941.472,1958.69,And that involves a lot of of work from communities and just informing our communities why it's important we need this money and why we are voting on more taxes on these corporations.,40,,
252,0.97,1958.69,1962.493,"In terms of taxation, local people pay more taxes than corporations.",40,,
253,0.97,1962.493,1963.995,I don't think that's fair.,40,,
254,0.97,1963.995,1969.5,A lot of people are--Amazon is going to take their business to a different state.,40,,
255,0.97,1969.5,1986.417,They need to pay their fair share of tax so we can provide a livable wage for our communities as well as budget on everything we need for our communities to thrive overall.,40,,
256,0.97,1986.417,1986.718,Thank you.,40,,
257,0.97,1986.718,1987.852,Thank you so much.,41,,
258,0.97,1987.852,1994.392,"I appreciate all the points you made, all completely accurate.",41,,
259,0.97,1994.392,2013.177,"One, you said it's unfair because Washington state has the most Regressive tax system, which means working people pay more of their incomes as taxes and the largest corporations and wealthiest play the least.",41,,
260,0.97,2013.177,2029.994,"Small businesses are also Overpenalized, so there's potential to build solidarity across working people across the state and many of the small businesses who pay taxes while the corporations are paying nothing close to their fair share.",41,,
261,0.97,2029.994,2050.982,And I agree with the point that the way to win such taxes on big business and the wealthy is mobilize the community and explain why we need this taxation.,41,,
262,0.97,2050.982,2064.228,"That's why the March succeeded, they agreed we need to tax big businesses like Amazon in order to raise revenues for affordable housing.",41,,
263,0.97,2064.228,2072.403,We talked about how affordable housing goes hand in hand with the fight against climate change.,41,,
264,0.97,2072.403,2089.387,"I look forward to all the members here reaching out to my office any time, and especially the green new deal oversight board members in your role as climate change advocates.",41,,
265,0.97,2089.387,2102.967,"Look forward to staying in touch with you and having you here for updated discussion, especially related to policy recommendations.",41,,
266,0.97,2102.967,2106.804,Your recommendations will be very much welcomed.,41,,
267,0.97,2106.804,2129.961,"If there are no comments from committee members, I will move the appointments recommended here today.",41,,
268,0.97,2129.961,2130.261,Second.,42,,
269,0.97,2130.261,2131.596,Thank you.,43,,
270,0.97,2131.596,2132.663,Call the roll.,43,,

277,0.97,2138.603,2139.937,Three in favor.,50,,
278,0.97,2139.937,2142.907,"Thank you, committee members.",51,,
279,0.97,2142.907,2150.715,The committee recommends that the city council confirm all those appointments and Reappointments and it will now go to the July 5th full city council meeting.,51,,
280,0.97,2150.715,2157.255,Thank you so much to all the appointees and staff.,51,,
281,0.97,2157.255,2159.824,"Again, apologies for the delays.",51,,
282,0.97,2159.824,2161.092,Thank you for waiting.,51,,
283,0.97,2161.092,2167.598,You're not expected to attend the full city council meeting but you're welcome to if you would like to.,51,,
284,0.97,2167.598,2173.738,"It will be on zoom, not in person.",51,,
285,0.97,2173.738,2174.172,Any other comments?,51,,
286,0.97,2174.172,2174.739,I will adjourn the meeting.,51,,
