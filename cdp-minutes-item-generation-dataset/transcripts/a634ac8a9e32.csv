71,0.97,436.769,439.872,Drivers have families like all of us.,14,,
72,0.97,439.872,448.915,They are struggling with what everybody else is whether it's distance learning for their kids or putting food on their table.,14,,
73,0.97,448.915,451.884,They should not be treated like an underclass in their pay it.,14,,

80,0.97,472.605,473.406,Hello?,16,,
81,0.97,473.406,473.639,Hi.,17,,
82,0.97,473.639,473.973,Please go ahead.,17,,
83,0.97,477.61,478.544,Yes.,18,,
84,0.97,478.544,484.483,My name is don cleary with the drivers Union calling in support for the fair pay legislation.,18,,
85,0.97,484.483,485.384,Why do drivers need more pay?,18,,
86,0.97,485.384,488.888,I'll give you a real quick personal reason from my life.,18,,
87,0.97,488.888,495.328,"Two weeks ago I took my car in to have a catalytic converter replaced, expensive enough as it is.",18,,
88,0.97,495.328,503.469,"By the time I got out of the shop there was a brake job and front Struts required as well, $2,700.",18,,
89,0.97,503.469,513.713,Now the TNC Uber and Lyft mileage and minute rates don't come anywhere near covering those kind of costs which are common when you start driving your car every day commercially.,18,,
90,0.97,513.713,518.417,So the Mayor's proposal is a big step towards Remedying this.,18,,
91,0.97,518.417,523.656,"However, the modest proposal that the drivers Union have made to increase that pay a little bit more would be very helpful.",18,,
92,0.97,524.657,531.297,I would like to add you folks have the power in doing this to pull thousands of Seattle workers into the middle class.,18,,
93,0.97,531.297,538.204,"I mean this is a fine moment, a moment of boldness and power.",18,,
94,0.97,538.204,538.971,Please seize it.,18,,
95,0.97,538.971,539.338,Thanks a lot.,18,,
96,0.97,539.338,546.846,Thank you for your comments.,19,,
97,0.97,546.846,547.88,"Jake Lindsay, good afternoon.",19,,
98,0.97,547.88,548.681,Hello.,20,,
99,0.97,548.681,548.915,Hi.,21,,
100,0.97,548.915,549.482,Please go ahead.,21,,
101,0.97,549.482,549.916,Hi.,22,,
102,0.97,549.916,550.85,My name is Jake.,22,,
103,0.97,550.85,559.959,I've been an Uber and Lyft driver since 2016 and volunteering with drivers Union since 2019 and wanted to Parrot what my brother don said.,22,,
104,0.97,559.959,567.5,Since I began driving the companies only V only ever cut our pay as they take more and more for themselves.,22,,
105,0.97,567.5,570.903,It's unconscionable these companies have gotten away with cutting our pay for so long.,22,,
106,0.97,570.903,576.876,This is especially unacceptable during the pandemic where we work a front line essential service moving people and goods.,22,,
107,0.97,576.876,579.712,The cost of cleaning our vehicles was high before the pandemic.,22,,
108,0.97,579.712,581.013,Now it is even higher.,22,,
109,0.97,581.013,588.721,We should be compensated for this public health service that we provided so long for free at huge risks to ourselves and our loved ones.,22,,
110,0.97,588.721,596.095,Uber and Lyft driving is also a job worked disproportionately by immigrants and people of color and this community is especially vulnerable right now.,22,,
111,0.97,596.095,604.937,So I urge you to raise our pay even further than the Mayor suggested in her proposal to make up for the years of pay cuts that our community has suffered.,22,,
112,0.97,604.937,605.237,Thank you.,22,,
113,0.97,605.237,605.504,Thank you.,23,,
114,0.97,606.138,609.375,"Michael Wolff, welcome.",23,,
115,0.97,611.077,613.813,Hi.,24,,
116,0.97,613.813,616.048,"This is Michael Wolff, executive director of drive forward.",24,,
117,0.97,616.048,629.662,"I want to be clear we're Testifying today against this legislation not because we don't support increased pay through a minimum earnings standard for drivers, but we understand that this legislation which is a Copycat of New York's legislation does not actually work.",24,,
118,0.97,633.265,641.974,Having the ongoing calculation of utilization rate forces companies to restrict access and freedom of drivers to access their paths.,24,,
119,0.97,641.974,643.209,This is not good for drivers.,24,,
120,0.97,643.209,649.515,We would urge the Council to remove the ongoing calculations of the utilization rate in the earnings standard.,24,,
121,0.97,649.515,650.316,Otherwise keep everything the same.,24,,
122,0.97,650.316,655.087,"We don't have a problem with anything else, but the utilization rate calculation.",24,,
123,0.97,655.087,656.989,Thank you.,24,,
124,0.97,658.724,661.894,"Thank you, Michael.",25,,
125,0.97,661.894,680.513,"The next three people are Zacaria Jarto Richo Umra and Albia . Z Acaria, please go ahead.",25,,
126,0.97,686.218,687.253,Do we have Zacaria with us?,25,,
127,0.97,691.457,692.124,Okay.,25,,
128,0.97,692.124,703.069,"The next person is RIC I'll come back to you, Zacaria, if you're still on the line.",25,,
129,0.97,703.069,704.203,"Hi, city council.",26,,
130,0.97,704.203,707.807,Today I'm presenting my driver Union for support.,26,,
131,0.97,707.807,717.249,"I just want to say that before this Covid-19 me and my husband were working for Uber and Lyft, but now as this pandemic starts I'm not able to work anymore.",26,,
132,0.97,717.249,725.057,"My kids are not going school and even my younger daughter is very vulnerable, but still we don't have any options.",26,,
133,0.97,725.057,727.56,So now only my husband works for us.,26,,
134,0.97,727.56,737.87,"He has to work almost 12 hours in driving because after every call he has to spend time to sanitize, to clean his car for the safety of customers and for his own family.",26,,
135,0.97,737.87,748.18,"My kids really Miss him because my husband has to spend all day out because when he comes home, he's so tired and at that time my kids already sleep.",26,,
136,0.97,748.18,756.755,"So my humble request, please raise our pay so we can earn enough money for our cost of living and also spend time with our kids, too, and our family.",26,,
137,0.97,756.755,757.223,Thank you.,26,,
138,0.97,757.223,760.326,Thank you very much.,27,,
139,0.97,760.326,765.231,Just checking to see if Zacaria is with us again.,27,,
140,0.97,765.231,766.799,Hi.,27,,
141,0.97,766.799,768.968,"Just push Star 6 to Unmute, please.",27,,
142,0.97,769.401,770.136,Welcome.,27,,
143,0.97,771.003,774.94,Can you hear me now?,28,,
144,0.97,774.94,775.407,Yes.,29,,
145,0.97,775.407,775.741,Thank you.,29,,
146,0.97,775.741,776.041,Hello.,30,,
147,0.97,776.041,782.915,We can hear you.,31,,
148,0.97,782.915,784.049,My name is Zachariah.,32,,
149,0.97,784.049,786.752,I have been Uber and Lyft driver the past five years.,32,,
150,0.97,786.752,805.137,"For all those years I've worked for Uber and Lyft a third of my earnings have gone to Uber and Lyft in the forms of Commission and booking fees while I'm paying all the expenses in the forms of the insurance, maintenance, car payments and gas, not to mention the wear and tear of my vehicle.",32,,
151,0.97,805.137,813.012,With the current pay I'm earning well below minimum wage.,32,,
152,0.97,813.012,820.219,"2019 I have driven over 70 miles, worked at least 80 hours a week.",32,,
153,0.97,820.219,821.554,I'm still below standard wage.,32,,
154,0.97,821.554,834.066,"For most of the drivers we are on the road, not able to spend with our family and still earning below minimum wage.",32,,
155,0.97,834.066,841.874,"I would like the Council members to consider fair pay and raising the standard wage for gig drivers, please.",32,,
156,0.97,841.874,850.282,Thank you for your time.,32,,
157,0.97,850.282,850.649,Thank you.,33,,
158,0.97,850.649,852.251,Fauna Abriel?,33,,
159,0.97,852.251,854.153,Can you hear me?,34,,
160,0.97,854.153,855.354,"Yes, thank you.",35,,
161,0.97,855.354,856.655,Please go ahead.,35,,
162,0.97,856.655,856.922,Sure.,36,,
163,0.97,856.922,861.994,"Thank you, Council members.",36,,
164,0.97,861.994,862.561,My name is fauna Abriel.,36,,
165,0.97,862.561,866.165,I'm a driver and part of the Union.,36,,
166,0.97,866.165,868.567,My agenda today is about the fair pay.,36,,
167,0.97,868.567,875.875,One of the reasons I'm asking for fair pay today is to give my kids family time with their dad.,36,,
168,0.97,875.875,879.111,As a driver he drives seven days a week more than 12 hours.,36,,
169,0.97,879.111,882.815,Lately he even drives more to welcome our new child.,36,,
170,0.97,882.815,889.955,The other reason that I am asking other than the cost of living in Seattle is to give my kids a Christmas present.,36,,
171,0.97,889.955,903.435,"They always write what they want for Christmases presents, but they never get what they ask, not because they are asking expensive stuff, but our budget is very tight.",36,,
172,0.97,903.435,907.873,"As a parent, that's very tough to see when you don't fulfill your kids' needs.",36,,
173,0.97,909.441,913.545,At least for Christmas since they never had family time or vacation time.,36,,
174,0.97,913.545,919.184,"Even though we are a driver, I believe our kids deserve a better life.",36,,
175,0.97,919.184,926.992,So please be our kids' happiness by fighting for fair pay.,36,,
176,0.97,926.992,928.127,Thank you so much.,36,,
177,0.97,928.127,928.527,Thank you.,37,,

182,0.97,949.682,963.095,Council members and staff received an Email from me this morning very passionately saying that I am against the ordinance in the fact that I demanded you guys to take out the $1.17 per mile ordinance.,38,,
183,0.97,963.095,971.337,"My second was as Michael Wolff is saying, is something that is going to be quite toxic in the long run for the viability for which we are to stay.",38,,
184,0.97,971.337,973.272,I'm for fair pay.,38,,
185,0.97,973.272,990.189,"I am for the 16.39 to go through, but I do not stand for something that will literally shift the very business models that Lyft and Uber provide currently for people to drive.",38,,
186,0.97,990.189,1003.035,This $1.17 will make it where we have to sign up in blocks and takes away our freedom to drive when we want to and I think what you're trying to solve can be simply solved in a different solution and I do not want this to pass because of that.,38,,
187,0.97,1003.035,1003.769,Please take it out.,38,,
188,0.97,1003.769,1010.309,Thank you very much for your time today.,39,,

194,0.97,1048.614,1055.821,The income I was making where I drive I was able to support my family of five and myself.,40,,
195,0.97,1055.821,1066.899,Today it's increased rent and expenses and with the same income today I'm finding it increasingly difficult to make it month to month.,40,,
196,0.97,1066.899,1069.034,I was forced out with Covid-19.,40,,
197,0.97,1069.034,1076.008,I do not have any savings that I could have used to cover my expenses.,40,,
198,0.97,1076.008,1082.214,"Therefore, I had to default all my monthly payments.",40,,

360,0.97,1874.639,1884.616,I have a family and with the current rate I cannot support my family and pay the bills.,67,,
361,0.97,1884.616,1889.52,This is why I'm in support of fair wage stabilization.,67,,
362,0.97,1889.52,1895.393,"When I started driving Uber, the Commission Uber was taking from the drivers was 5%.",67,,
363,0.97,1895.393,1906.804,Now the Commission of Uber and Lyft from drivers is higher and the cost of living has gone up.,67,,
364,0.97,1906.804,1907.672,Drivers never get a raise.,67,,
365,0.97,1911.876,1914.078,Please support this legislation and thank you for your time.,67,,
366,0.97,1916.147,1917.482,Excellent.,68,,

373,0.97,1954.552,1956.187,My name is France Gumo.,69,,
374,0.97,1956.187,1961.392,I would like to highlight the huge expense Uber drivers occur.,69,,
375,0.97,1963.928,1972.804,We get 100 rides every week and out of each ride Uber and Lyft take $2 booking fee which they say goes to us insurance.,69,,
376,0.97,1972.804,1978.509,That means in a month we have paid in about $800 on insurance only.,69,,
377,0.97,1978.509,1991.322,On top of that we have to get insurance for vehicles which add to another 300 to 400.,69,,
378,0.97,1991.322,1992.623,That makes insurance expensive per month.,69,,
379,0.97,1992.623,2004.135,"So if you can help us with this insurance issue, it can help us and more without increasing what Uber and Lyft try to take from us.",69,,
380,0.97,2004.135,2004.369,Thank you.,69,,
381,0.97,2004.969,2007.939,Thank you for your time.,70,,

392,0.97,2039.303,2052.083,"The reason why, I start driving Uber and Lyft since 2014 and they used to put down the fare price, you know.",72,,
393,0.97,2052.083,2055.486,They kept going down while the cost of living was going up.,72,,
394,0.97,2058.923,2070.368,"So we are asking legislation to be passed and the rate we'll receive enough money because it's not safe job, you know.",72,,
395,0.97,2070.368,2071.169,Every time going down.,72,,
396,0.97,2071.169,2072.036,So thank you so much.,72,,
397,0.97,2073.504,2075.239,Thank you very much.,73,,

403,0.97,2096.327,2099.664,Thank you to let me speak.,74,,
404,0.97,2100.865,2110.341,We have what we can say like 90% of our Uber and Lyft drivers don't have insurance because it cost an awful lot in Seattle.,74,,
405,0.97,2113.978,2130.128,"I support the Union for the fair share ride because if you don't have it, if something happens to anyone or your family, you don't have nothing, nothing to support them.",74,,
406,0.97,2132.563,2133.297,That's my worry.,74,,
407,0.97,2133.898,2134.065,Thank you.,74,,
408,0.97,2134.899,2138.202,Thank you very much.,75,,

413,0.97,2166.898,2169.4,We strongly support the fair share plan to raise driver pay.,76,,
414,0.97,2169.4,2174.805,This is critical labor protection and something we can do now to improve people's lives.,76,,
415,0.97,2174.805,2186.45,"Raising pay would address racial inequality and low wages in our community and it would be yet another way for Seattle to lead the nation on progressive labor protection as we have done with paid sick leave, the minimum wage and more.",76,,
416,0.97,2186.45,2198.496,So please stand with the broad coalition of advocates and support this legislation and let's finish this job and insure that Uber and Lyft drivers in our city can earn a living wage.,76,,
417,0.97,2198.496,2199.297,Thank you so much.,76,,

455,0.97,2325.489,2325.79,Perfect.,85,,
456,0.97,2325.79,2337.301,"I'm not more to talk about the payment, but I like to share my testimony as a part-time driver.",85,,
457,0.97,2337.301,2341.038,Now I'm a part-time Caregiver and also a part-time Uber driver.,85,,
458,0.97,2341.038,2354.385,"It allows me to have family time to help my grandson between time, you know, right now Online courses and maybe other family members, my nieces and my nephews.",85,,
459,0.97,2354.385,2359.89,"I like the in sync pay, but I'm more threatened with the possible being paid on payroll.",85,,
460,0.97,2359.89,2363.627,So I'm afraid of losing the flexibility of payment and drive as I please.,85,,
461,0.97,2366.43,2375.406,So I was hoping maybe you can reconsider or maybe find other options for part-time drivers and full-time drivers.,85,,
462,0.97,2377.641,2380.511,Excellent.,86,,
463,0.97,2380.511,2382.113,Please continue if you have another sentence.,86,,
464,0.97,2382.113,2383.447,I lost my thought.,87,,
465,0.97,2383.447,2384.548,I'm so sorry.,87,,
466,0.97,2384.548,2384.915,That's okay.,88,,

470,0.97,2395.693,2395.926,Yeah.,89,,
471,0.97,2395.926,2404.101,"Just the flexibility and being able to make family time to help family around, you know, just help family.",89,,
472,0.97,2404.101,2404.402,Thank you.,89,,
473,0.97,2404.402,2404.769,Absolutely.,90,,

477,0.97,2418.149,2419.917,Can you --,91,,
478,0.97,2419.917,2420.284,Yeah.,92,,

482,0.97,2424.989,2425.256,Yeah.,95,,
483,0.97,2425.256,2436.634,I've been driving for over four years just for Lyft and I don't support this change because the model has failed before that you want to use.,95,,
484,0.97,2436.634,2469.6,"The other thing I'd really like to kind of point out is the system has a rating system and some of the people who aren't making really good money are the ones who have got their ratings below 3 from their passengers which means they never get matched again and we do have recurring people in areas that use the service and if that driver either has a bad car or a bad whatever and the passenger doesn't like them, they rate them and then they never get matched again.",95,,
485,0.97,2469.6,2473.037,So I think that would be a component that should be looked at.,95,,
486,0.97,2476.54,2479.543,"Also if you know what times to drive, it's better.",95,,
487,0.97,2479.543,2482.88,So I support it the way it is.,95,,
488,0.97,2482.88,2483.481,I'm a senior.,95,,
489,0.97,2483.481,2488.786,Without this I can't afford my supplemental insurance and I would really hate to see that go away.,95,,
490,0.97,2489.019,2489.987,Thank you.,95,,

497,0.97,2523.787,2532.763,I am retired and a widow living on Social Security and driving for Lyft which gives me flexibility to maintain my lifestyle.,97,,
498,0.97,2532.763,2538.903,The beauty of Rideshare is the ability to turn on and off the App and decide to drive when and where I want to.,97,,

500,0.97,2557.421,2566.864,This problematic legislation will force Rideshare companies and I want to say finally that I am a mother.,97,,

535,0.97,2725.656,2747.945,I'm Anthony gay and I'm a city of Seattle resident and I've been driving as an independent contractor for various technology delivery Apps since 2017 and I've never been so blessed with an ability to create financial income for myself in such abundance as I have in the three years including during these recent troubling times.,103,,
536,0.97,2747.945,2764.795,I urge you to consider that many other independent contractors and drivers through such technology Apps have a similar experience of increased freedom and financial empowerment derived from unencumbered access by unnecessary government interference to these Apps.,103,,
537,0.97,2764.795,2778.942,"I've never felt a need or desire or want for anyone to interfere or protect me from the App companies that I've contracted with and if I had a choice, I would either present my case to those contracted or pursue other more favorable work.",103,,
538,0.97,2778.942,2789.987,"Unfortunately I believe the problem is that some contractors do not understand that they are, in fact, working for themselves and thus responsibility for improving their income ability is on them.",103,,
539,0.97,2789.987,2812.543,"I think that any contractors pushing toward demand for a guaranteed compensation are, in fact, the poorest performers and would rather depend on government guarantee and oversight rather than improve their own performance or even simply choose to quit by choosing a different career and a field requiring less responsibility and less risk than is necessary for being an independent contractor.",103,,
540,0.97,2812.543,2812.843,Thank you.,103,,
541,0.97,2812.843,2813.577,"Thank you, Anthony.",104,,
542,0.97,2813.577,2816.88,"Walt, you are up next.",104,,
543,0.97,2821.585,2822.92,"Hi, thank you.",105,,
544,0.97,2822.92,2824.588,Can you hear me?,105,,
545,0.97,2824.588,2824.822,Yes.,106,,
546,0.97,2824.822,2826.857,Sorry about that.,106,,
547,0.97,2826.857,2827.891,Please go ahead.,106,,
548,0.97,2827.891,2828.125,Yes.,107,,
549,0.97,2828.125,2828.425,Thank you.,107,,
550,0.97,2828.425,2828.792,Walter Ellis.,107,,
551,0.97,2828.792,2833.497,I've been driving on the Uber and Lyft platform about five years now.,107,,
552,0.97,2833.497,2843.073,Over these years Uber and Lyft have consistently increased their market power by squeezing out other options and creating fewer options for drivers like me.,107,,
553,0.97,2843.073,2850.013,"So then they abuse this market power by effectively telling us well, here, take less.",107,,
554,0.97,2850.013,2859.823,"If you don't like it, have a so effectively we have a choice of taking nothing or taking less.",107,,
555,0.97,2859.823,2864.895,They bully us repeatedly year after year reducing what it is we get paid and also they try to scare us.,107,,
556,0.97,2864.895,2872.97,"They try to tell us Oh, my gosh, if you stand up and demand rights and demand respect, we might take our ball and leave.",107,,
557,0.97,2872.97,2879.109,"Not only are they trying to bully us, but they're trying to bully the city and tell the city they're too big to fail.",107,,
558,0.97,2879.109,2902.165,"Then really the people who are too big to fail are the people of Seattle, the drivers like me, the people who depend on this to feed our families and we are the ones who are suffering based on Uber and Lyft's threats to basically cut everything so that they can enhance their shareholder values at the expenses of regular people like me.",107,,
559,0.97,2903.967,2905.235,Thank you.,107,,
560,0.97,2905.235,2907.638,Thank you for your testimony.,108,,
561,0.97,2907.638,2908.105,Thank you very much.,108,,
562,0.97,2908.105,2910.941,"Noah, please go ahead.",108,,
563,0.97,2921.685,2926.857,"Noah, are you with us?",108,,
564,0.97,2926.857,2936.366,And after Noah will be Dragmar.,108,,
565,0.97,2936.366,2939.369,"Hi, Noah, please go ahead.",108,,
566,0.97,2939.369,2939.536,Hi.,108,,
567,0.97,2939.536,2940.203,Can you hear me now?,108,,
568,0.97,2941.505,2947.411,I can see you on there if you can test your Audio.,108,,
569,0.97,2948.812,2949.746,Just happened again.,108,,
570,0.97,2951.081,2952.916,Can you hear me?,109,,
571,0.97,2952.916,2955.285,There we go.,110,,
572,0.97,2955.285,2958.922,Please go ahead.,110,,
573,0.97,2958.922,2959.189,Okay.,111,,
574,0.97,2959.189,2959.589,I'm Noah Miller.,111,,
575,0.97,2959.589,2965.662,I do not support the fair share.,111,,
576,0.97,2965.662,2974.404,"I understand some people--I support making more income, but it's all about work ethic, driving when it's busy and driving in areas where it's busy.",111,,
577,0.97,2974.404,3013.477,"I've been driving Uber and Lyft since April 2018 and I make a lot of money and I believe putting this policy into law will destroy thousands of opportunities for thousands of people and it will limit the amount of drivers that can go Online and also the flexibility of choosing when you want to drive and I do not support it at all because I look at all the different arguments and everything and I believe if you go out there and you drive in the busy times, the areas instead of sitting out, you will make the money you need to support your family.",111,,
578,0.97,3015.445,3018.448,Thank you very much.,112,,
579,0.97,3018.448,3020.917,"And Dragmar, are you there?",112,,
580,0.97,3020.917,3023.653,"Yes, I am.",113,,
581,0.97,3023.653,3023.987,Wonderful.,114,,
582,0.97,3023.987,3025.956,Please go ahead.,114,,
583,0.97,3025.956,3027.557,Hi.,115,,
584,0.97,3027.557,3028.925,My name is Dragmar Maros.,115,,
585,0.97,3028.925,3031.094,I've been driving for Uber and Lyft five years now.,115,,
586,0.97,3031.094,3038.101,"Prior to this I used to live in California and I used to own my own taxi company with many cars, many drivers.",115,,
587,0.97,3038.101,3042.072,"When Uber showed up, I sold my company because I knew I cannot compete with them.",115,,
588,0.97,3042.072,3049.913,"So with this issue you guys implement now, if this is like the New York, this is not going to work 100% trust me.",115,,
589,0.97,3049.913,3051.681,I have 21 years experience in the Transportation Department.,115,,
590,0.97,3054.718,3059.856,You cannot tell a driver what to work or not.,115,,
591,0.97,3059.856,3060.757,"That's impossible, right?",115,,
592,0.97,3060.757,3063.26,Because that means you'll have to have that driver quit.,115,,
593,0.97,3063.26,3067.931,That's for sure and then I'm not saying that Uber and Lyft are perfect.,115,,
594,0.97,3067.931,3068.598,I'll give an example.,115,,
595,0.97,3068.598,3082.012,"I bought a $60,000 car and all of a sudden Uber cut off the select which I'm not making mine no more.",115,,
596,0.97,3082.012,3084.347,Lyft cut off the looks black from my App.,115,,
597,0.97,3084.347,3087.25,"So I'm not saying things cannot be done, right?",115,,
598,0.97,3087.25,3097.594,"But a money issue, you want to work, you get out there, sit in the car and work and by implementing these kind of rules and changes, they're not going to bring more customers.",115,,
599,0.97,3097.594,3124.754,"If you're innocent not in a car and if you sit at home, you're not going to make money even if your App is open, one, and two, after you guys block to us go pick up at the airport unless you have hybrid car, I have hybrid engine car, you put $100 in gas, the day's gone.",115,,
600,0.97,3124.754,3130.026,"I cannot pick up at the airport with Uber, which is ridiculous, all right?",115,,
601,0.97,3130.026,3133.763,"Wrap up for us real quick, if you can.",116,,
602,0.97,3133.763,3134.164,"Wrap up, please.",116,,
603,0.97,3134.164,3134.431,Yeah.,117,,
604,0.97,3134.431,3137.134,Overall I don't agree with this at all.,117,,
605,0.97,3137.134,3138.869,"Trust me, I have 21 years experience.",117,,
606,0.97,3138.869,3139.736,It's not going to work.,117,,
607,0.97,3139.736,3141.805,You're going to hurt thousands of people.,117,,
608,0.97,3141.805,3143.373,You're going to hurt them.,117,,
609,0.97,3143.373,3144.207,Thank you very much.,118,,
610,0.97,3144.207,3145.175,Thank you for your time.,118,,
611,0.97,3145.175,3152.449,"The last three people that I see are Robert, Ahmed and Jared.",118,,
612,0.97,3152.449,3155.986,"Robert, I want to double check that you are with us.",118,,
613,0.97,3155.986,3156.62,I see not present.,118,,
614,0.97,3156.62,3163.293,Can I double check that we can Unmute Robert and the same is true of Ahmed.,118,,
615,0.97,3163.293,3167.164,"I see you listed as not present, but I just want to double check.",118,,
616,0.97,3167.164,3170.534,Can we double check the lines?,118,,
617,0.97,3171.935,3174.804,None of those are present.,119,,
618,0.97,3174.804,3176.072,Okay.,120,,
619,0.97,3176.072,3183.113,And then Jared Porter and Ahman Hussain?,120,,
620,0.97,3183.113,3183.713,"Jared Porter, Ahman Hussain?",120,,
621,0.97,3183.713,3187.117,Those are all not present.,121,,
622,0.97,3187.117,3187.384,Okay.,122,,
623,0.97,3187.384,3192.856,"Folks, that gets us through everybody who is currently present and signed up to testimony.",122,,
624,0.97,3192.856,3193.49,I appreciate the flexibility.,122,,
625,0.97,3193.49,3197.627,We did go about ten minutes extra.,122,,
626,0.97,3197.627,3206.803,"Madam clerk, I apologize for that and want to emphasize our sincere interest in hearing from everybody who was present to also accommodate for anybody who didn't get the chance to speak last time.",122,,
627,0.97,3206.803,3214.01,We did get through everybody this time and as well as everybody present on my list last time.,122,,
628,0.97,3214.01,3216.947,Thank you all for calling in.,122,,
629,0.97,3216.947,3219.249,That does wrap up the public comment portion.,122,,
630,0.97,3219.249,3237.701,Public comment is now closed and we'll move on to the first item of business which is actually listed as item number three.,122,,
631,0.97,3237.701,3241.071,Council bill 119876.,123,,
632,0.97,3241.805,3286.249,"An ordinance relating to transportation network company driver labor standards; establishing minimum labor and compensation standards for transportation network company drivers; establishing provision of or reimbursement for personal protective equipment to transportation network company drivers during the civil emergency declared on March 3, 2020.",123,,
633,0.97,3288.318,3314.844,"Dr. Marissa Baker is from the University of Washington, here to talk about the health and safety standards many of us have heard about the last few months and I know is especially a concern and worry as we think about not only the protection and safety for drivers, but also for riders in the car.",124,,
634,0.97,3314.844,3324.621,"You've received the letters from last week and Karina, with Yourindulgence, we'll do your presentation after we hear from Dr. Baker.",124,,
635,0.97,3324.621,3330.26,"Colleagues, I thought this was an important way to begin the presentation today as we think about some of the possible changes in front of us.",124,,
636,0.97,3330.26,3334.264,Over the lunch break I had the opportunity to see my sister.,124,,
637,0.97,3334.264,3334.564,She's 34.,124,,
638,0.97,3334.564,3337.534,She was diagnosed with MS at 19 years old.,124,,
639,0.97,3337.534,3349.212,She comes up to Seattle every six months to get her Infusions and you know that with a compromised immune system due to multiple sclerosis we are always worried about her health and safety.,124,,
640,0.97,3349.212,3375.472,"She took a Lyft over from Cherry Street and took a Lyft back and this is a really key way for many in our community to get around our city and we want to make sure they're safe always, but especially with people who have compromised immune systems or who may be elderly and use Uber, it's really timely for us to hear from you.",124,,
641,0.97,3375.472,3406.336,"I was thinking about you as I saw her on her Lyft going to the doctor's office and how important it is to protect the health and safety of riders and drivers and wanted to share that example why I think the presentation you're about to share with us is so critical in the moment of Covid, but also for ongoing public health and safety for all riders and drivers going forward.",124,,
642,0.97,3406.336,3406.703,Thank you.,125,,
643,0.97,3406.703,3408.638,I just have words to share.,125,,
644,0.97,3408.638,3410.073,I don't have a screen.,125,,
645,0.97,3410.073,3411.975,My name is Marissa Baker.,125,,
646,0.97,3411.975,3422.051,I'm an assistant professor in the Department of environmental and occupational health sciences in the University of Washington school of public health.,125,,
647,0.97,3422.051,3443.84,"I also direct the industrial hygiene training program through our Northwest center for occupational health and safety funded by the National Institute for occupational safety and health . I study how exposures encountered at work can influence health, not only for workers, but also the community at large.",125,,
648,0.97,3443.84,3459.289,"These exposures might be chemical, physical or Psychosocial and recently my work has really focused on biological exposures due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the urgent occupational health needs it has presented us.",125,,
649,0.97,3459.289,3481.678,"Through my training and research I've observed time and time again the important role the workplace plays in infectious disease transformation and now due to the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic we've seen this and all realize this such always the case of meat processing plants for agricultural workers, but workers are also our community members.",125,,
650,0.97,3481.678,3496.092,So the infections that they may encounter at work are transported back into the community.,125,,
651,0.97,3496.092,3498.328,Community members can also infect workers.,125,,
652,0.97,3498.328,3515.545,"This serves as a vector of disease transmission and therefore is an important place for interventions to be focused because these interventions not only protect the workers, but also the community members that the workers encounters both inside and outside their workplace.",125,,
653,0.97,3515.545,3517.947,For Tmc drivers their workplace is their vehicle.,125,,
654,0.97,3517.947,3530.46,"These drivers as we know transport multiple people over the course of the day and each interaction is a chance to spread a disease, a disease which could then be spread to subsequent passengers and anyone else the driver or passenger may encounter.",125,,
655,0.97,3532.195,3545.909,"Knowing the workplaces or in the case of Tmc drivers, their vehicles are important for infectious disease transmission.",125,,
656,0.97,3545.909,3555.285,"As a health, I know it's important to come up with Evidence-Based policies, practices and controls to protect these workers and the community members they encounter at work.",125,,
657,0.97,3555.285,3560.49,"Just to reiterate, controlling exposures in TNC vehicles will help reduce infections in the community.",125,,
658,0.97,3560.49,3563.927,It will reduce the burden of infections.,125,,
659,0.97,3563.927,3567.13,So Ppe is one control that has got to be used.,125,,
660,0.97,3567.13,3570.8,Drivers are in an enclosed space with multiple people.,125,,
661,0.97,3570.8,3572.802,They're frequently less than six feet apart.,125,,
662,0.97,3572.802,3581.611,They're often together for periods of time that are long enough to discussion an exposure event which is around 10 to 15 minutes.,125,,
663,0.97,3581.611,3591.187,"Given the airborne route of transmission for Covid-19 and other infectious disease, small particles can be released by passengers even if all they are doing is breathing.",125,,
664,0.97,3591.187,3594.824,It can linger in the air even after the passenger has left.,125,,
665,0.97,3594.824,3603.366,"So this makes it important for respiratory protection to be worn at all times by drivers and preferably their passengers, too.",125,,
666,0.97,3603.366,3614.544,"In fact, Washington State Department of labor and industries would characterize drivers as being in the medium to high exposure risk group and I would as well.",125,,
667,0.97,3614.544,3617.246,For this risk group cloth masks are not advised.,125,,
668,0.97,3617.246,3636.933,"Drivers would need to be in disposable medical masks at a minimum and there could be instances where an N95 mask would be warranted, especially if their passenger was not masked or if their passenger had symptoms consistent with an infectious disease or they were transporting that passenger to a testing or hospital site which occurs frequently.",125,,
669,0.97,3638.901,3646.843,So the recommended masks are disposable and need to be replaced when they are worn out or damaged or get wet.,125,,
670,0.97,3646.843,3651.28,"Ideally at least once a day, but often more frequently.",125,,
671,0.97,3651.28,3658.855,Drivers will need multiple masks over the course of a week or day and this can come at considerable cost.,125,,
672,0.97,3658.855,3671.0,"In Washington employers are required to provide Ppe to workers at no cost to the worker and TNC drivers should be no different, especially since their need for Ppe is great.",125,,
673,0.97,3671.0,3680.777,The potential to decrease the spread of infection and the potential to decrease the spread of are infection with drivers and passengers wearing Ppe is notable.,125,,
674,0.97,3680.777,3686.983,Another important control to be used in vehicles is cleaning and Disinfecting.,125,,
675,0.97,3686.983,3691.087,"Briefly, these are two separate processes, but they're often used together.",125,,
676,0.97,3691.087,3691.788,That's important to remember.,125,,
677,0.97,3691.788,3697.293,"Cleaning is the removal of germs, dirt or impurities from a surface.",125,,
678,0.97,3697.293,3699.762,"It doesn't kill germs, but it removes them.",125,,
679,0.97,3699.762,3706.836,It LOWERS their number and the risk of spreading infection.,125,,
680,0.97,3706.836,3713.042,Disinfecting refers to using an Epa-Registered Disinfectant to kill germs on surfaces.,125,,
681,0.97,3713.042,3724.187,"This process doesn't clean the dirty surface or remove the germ, but by killing the germs on a surface after cleaning it, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection.",125,,
682,0.97,3724.187,3744.006,"So for TNC drivers they may not need to clean after each passenger, but they know might and however, they certainly would need to Disinfect after each passenger and that is consistent with guidance from the Washington State Department of labor and industrials and also consistent with the best scientific knowledge around how infectious agents spread.",125,,
683,0.97,3747.71,3779.408,"So again recognizing this airborne transmission of the virus and the enclosed space the drivers and riders are in together, Disinfecting would be necessary on many surfaces in the vehicle including but not limited to the Seatbelt latch, the windows where condensation from breath could form, the handle both inside and outside the car and any other porous or hard surfaces in the car where the passenger could have breathed on them and left those droplets that we're concerned about.",125,,
684,0.97,3779.408,3793.389,"When I mentioned Disinfecting, I don't want the drivers to feel they have to rush in and spray a Disinfectant all over the back of their car and that's fine because this could Unfortunately introduce other chemical exposures for them that are in the spray that they're using.",125,,
685,0.97,3795.958,3807.37,"So they really need time to put on gloves, spray the Disinfectant into a cloth and use the cloth to rub over areas of concern and let it sit for the required contact time.",125,,
686,0.97,3807.37,3810.473,All of this takes time and I recognize that.,125,,
687,0.97,3810.473,3820.65,"However, this is the method that is most protective of their health and would be the appropriate way to clean their vehicles even though the time to do so could take longer.",125,,
688,0.97,3822.084,3829.826,I also want to remind the Council vehicle cleaning should not be limited to the Covid-19 pandemic.,125,,
689,0.97,3829.826,3842.772,"Covid-19 has certainly brought to the forefront the importance of Hygiene and as a public health professor and occupational health researcher, I am heartened to see increased consciousness around how infectious agents Spry.",125,,
690,0.97,3842.772,3854.65,"However, many other diseases we encounter every year such as flu, cold, other infectious diseases also spread through droplets and transmission.",125,,
691,0.97,3854.65,3858.187,So it makes it important to clean vehicles.,125,,
692,0.97,3858.187,3862.858,We've already begun to see a permanent change in public perception.,125,,
693,0.97,3862.858,3871.601,Hygiene is expected and will continue to be expected by the riding public long past the Covid-19 pandemic.,125,,
694,0.97,3871.601,3888.885,"Lastly, there are other Biohazard events that would require more in depth cleaning and Disinfecting procedures for TNC drivers such as if you have a rider that might bleed or Vomit in their vehicle.",125,,
695,0.97,3888.885,3900.83,These events call swift and timely cleaning and doing an inadequate job could pose a substantial health risk to subsequent passengers in the vehicle.,125,,
696,0.97,3900.83,3909.338,I want to reiterate the importance of enacting policies and practices to limit exposure in workplaces such as TNC drivers vehicles.,125,,
697,0.97,3909.338,3917.079,Controlling exposure in work settings leads to decrease in infections in the general community ultimately decreasing the burden of disease in a community.,125,,
698,0.97,3917.079,3946.542,For TNC drivers a ready supply of appropriate Ppe is important to protecting themselves at work and protecting their passengers and time to appropriately clean and Disinfect their vehicles between riders is important during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond as infectious diseases are not limited to this pandemic and there are other Biohazardous events such as vomiting or bleeding that are coming in TNC vehicles and warrant timely cleaning and Disinfecting efforts.,125,,
699,0.97,3946.542,3955.518,So I really appreciate the opportunity to share my expertise and the best available science on these topics with the Council today and I certainly welcome questions now or via Email that may come up.,125,,
700,0.97,3957.92,3966.262,"Dr. Baker, thank you very much for all of your research, your work and willingness to share this with us on today's committee discussion.",126,,
701,0.97,3966.262,3980.976,"I want to note for my Council colleagues much of your research in these findings have been noted in the legislation that's in front of us today beginning on the bottom of page four, section H in our findings.",126,,
702,0.97,3980.976,3991.42,It was important for I think the viewing public and the history of the background behind some of the changes that we're suggesting to have this codified in statute and for the purposes for our discussion today.,126,,
703,0.97,3991.42,4005.835,I want to thank you and note that we have folded in this research that you just outlined into the conversations on page four and five of the draft legislation in front of us.,126,,
704,0.97,4005.835,4010.005,"Colleagues, we do have five to ten more minutes with Dr.",126,,
705,0.97,4010.005,4010.239,Baker.,126,,
706,0.97,4010.239,4012.641,Is there any additional questions or anything you'd like to share?,126,,
707,0.97,4014.477,4015.878,I will add one note.,126,,
708,0.97,4015.878,4035.264,"Dr. Baker, when I was reading you research over the last week or so, it was also during our board of health meeting time and there's a number of members here who have been past board of health members and also current board members with me and what we heard from Dr.",126,,
709,0.97,4035.264,4040.136,Duchin who is our local Seattle King County public health director is exactly what you said.,126,,
710,0.97,4040.136,4051.313,"This is the type of cleaning and public health safety precautions that we need to see go into place now, but he also cautioned as you did this is going to be the new normal.",126,,
711,0.97,4051.313,4080.309,"People ave a new expectation and hopefully a new set of behaviors coming out of Covid and it might not be Coronavirus 19, but it will be some new form of virus, a new Coronavirus, and it will be, you know, up to us to continue good hygiene practices, good public health practices to protect against the next Iteration of a Covid-19Like virus.",126,,
712,0.97,4080.309,4092.721,"So I think it's really important to emphasize what you said, that this is not a static point in time, it will all go back to normal.",126,,
713,0.97,4092.721,4097.426,That Dr. Duchin says we will not have an opportunity to go back to normal.,126,,
714,0.97,4097.426,4100.763,Hopefully this is our new normal going forward to prevent diseases in the future.,126,,
715,0.97,4102.465,4104.867,"Council member Strauss, did you have anything?",126,,
716,0.97,4104.867,4107.57,I saw you come off mute?,126,,
717,0.97,4107.57,4107.77,Okay.,126,,
718,0.97,4107.77,4112.341,"Dr. Baker, I don't see additional questions.",126,,
719,0.97,4112.341,4119.949,"Karina, any additional comments or questions on this piece before we let the doctor go?",126,,
720,0.97,4119.949,4120.382,No questions.,127,,
721,0.97,4120.382,4135.664,"Dr. Baker, thanks for your research and sending us your materials and we look forward to lifting up the letters you Schrader shared with us and very excited you were able to join us today.",128,,
722,0.97,4135.664,4139.802,"Karina, thank you for all your work and time and being with us.",128,,
723,0.97,4139.802,4157.753,"We know we have begun this conversation quite a while ago, just want to reiterate for the public we're hoping to finalize a conversation we began prior to the recess this year, but it's a conversation we began last year and years before.",128,,
724,0.97,4157.753,4163.459,I'm hoping this is our last major piece of legislation from our committee this year.,128,,
725,0.97,4163.459,4176.205,"Last fall during the budget this council passed a series of pieces of legislation surrounding TNC industry including the resolution requesting a study on wages, benefits and more.",128,,
726,0.97,4176.205,4177.239,The study was completed.,128,,
727,0.97,4177.239,4183.913,We circulated a copy on July 8th along with a study commissioned by TNC companies Uber and Lyft.,128,,
728,0.97,4183.913,4209.371,"The week of August 10th my office coordinated with the Mayor's office and office of labor standards to provide staff briefings on the study and legislation and almost all the offices were in attendance, so a huge, huge note of appreciation for Kerem Levitas from the office of labor standards, Karina, you and Amy Gore from central staff for your work the last few years.",128,,
729,0.97,4209.371,4233.796,"We've spent a lot of time looking over the particular study embedded in this legislation and I think what's in front of us is very well thought out, appreciate that the Council present hosted a TNC presentation in committee August 17th and last week on September 15th we held another hearing on this legislation to highlight concerns, questions and talk about possible amendments coming forward.",128,,
730,0.97,4233.796,4243.672,With all of your work and all the help from various Council members who submitted ideas we really appreciate the opportunity to walk through the substitute with Karina.,128,,
731,0.97,4243.672,4247.91,There's Afew pieces in here that Resonate with the conversation we had last week.,128,,
732,0.97,4247.91,4256.085,Let's go ahead and dive into the substitute unless there's additional comments from our colleagues.,128,,
733,0.97,4256.085,4256.752,"Hello, council member Herbold.",128,,
734,0.97,4256.752,4257.453,Thank you for joining us.,128,,
735,0.97,4257.453,4262.491,"I know you've been on the line, haven't had the chance to say hello yet.",128,,
736,0.97,4262.491,4263.158,Thanks for being here.,128,,
737,0.97,4263.158,4265.861,"Karina, why don't you take it away.",128,,
738,0.97,4265.861,4266.595,"Hi, everyone.",129,,
739,0.97,4266.595,4270.799,I'm Karina bull on city council central staff.,129,,
740,0.97,4270.799,4285.881,I have a power point presentation for today which I will Cue up.,129,,
741,0.97,4285.881,4314.41,"The goal from my presentation today is to briefly review the legislation which is Council bill 119876 very briefly because there have already been a number of presentations on this bill, but I think it might be helpful to go over some of the key components, especially as they relate to the substitute bill and amendments to some of those components as well.",129,,
742,0.97,4314.41,4331.193,This ordinance establishes at its core minimum compensation standards and other labor protections for transportation network company drivers and it would go into effect January 1ST of 2021 and would be implemented by the city's office of labor standards.,129,,
743,0.97,4331.193,4349.411,The key components are the minimum pay standards for drivers and protections which is a guarantee drivers can keep customer paid tips separate from compensation owed them by the transportation network companies.,129,,
744,0.97,4349.411,4364.026,"The provision of personal protective equipment and Disinfecting supplies, that is the provision of those supplies or reimbursement for the cost of those supplies and that does not include time for the drivers to actually use those supplies.",129,,
745,0.97,4365.627,4374.336,And the time it would take to clean their vehicles separate from the Covid-19 emergency.,129,,
746,0.97,4374.336,4382.411,So I'll go into the cleaning time added to the minimum compensation standard later that's in the substitute bill.,129,,
747,0.97,4382.411,4386.982,Next are transparency requirements for TNC drivers and passengers.,129,,
748,0.97,4386.982,4406.435,That means the Tncs are required to provide directly after the passenger trip with a variety of different information and last a TNC study that is Tasked to Ols and also the city auditor's office.,129,,
749,0.97,4407.77,4424.753,"Just to ground us in an understanding of how this legislation is approaching the minimum compensation standard, I am using several slides office of labor standards has generously allowed central staff to borrow.",129,,
750,0.97,4424.753,4433.128,This is a reminder that the compensation standard covers all of the time that the drivers are logged into the App.,129,,
751,0.97,4433.128,4441.97,"The P1, P2 and P3 time, that's the shorthand reference to available platform time and dispatch platform time and passenger platform time.",129,,
752,0.97,4441.97,4449.878,The P1 and P2 represent the time that the drivers are driving around waiting to be assigned a ride.,129,,
753,0.97,4449.878,4463.091,The P2 time is the time it takes the driver to get to the passenger and the 3 represents when the passenger is in the vehicle moving to their final destination.,129,,
754,0.97,4463.091,4464.226,The minimum compensation standard has two components.,129,,
755,0.97,4464.226,4475.07,"One is payment for the driver's time that they spend working waiting for a ride, driving to a passenger and then transporting that passenger.",129,,
756,0.97,4475.07,4493.355,"The next piece is compensation for mileage expenses, operating costs and also compensation for things these drivers aren't getting.",129,,
757,0.97,4493.355,4508.604,"They aren't getting the benefit of being covered by Seattle's minimum wage, hence this legislation, and also they aren't getting the benefit of other protections like Employer- provided health insurance and the fact that employers would pay payroll taxes and other items as well.",129,,
758,0.97,4508.604,4529.791,"Just to put a finer point on that, as folks can see in the legislation in front of us, also in the findings, when we hear that drivers are making around $21.53 per hour, the reality is that the drivers are often taking home about $9.73 per hour.",130,,
759,0.97,4529.791,4544.873,"Put that in contrast with what our city's minimum wage is, somewhere between $13.50 to $16.39 and I think it puts in stark contrast the wage disparity that many of these drivers currently have.",130,,
760,0.97,4544.873,4546.475,$9.73 is nowhere near our minimum wage.,130,,
761,0.97,4546.475,4553.315,So that's really the crux of what we're trying to address here.,130,,
762,0.97,4553.315,4558.453,Yes.,131,,
763,0.97,4558.453,4601.53,"As a follow-up to that concept, when we hear that drivers are making $23 an hour, we should assume there are obviously exceptions, but for the most part they're not removing the costs associated with the work that has to be done to do this job, whether or not it's maintaining the vehicle or some of the other costs that are part of this formula, that those costs have not been reduced from what the drivers see as earnings.",132,,
764,0.97,4601.53,4601.83,Correct.,133,,
765,0.97,4601.83,4606.301,So the reasonable intentions make up the bulk of what they're made and they're not reimbursed for those.,133,,
766,0.97,4606.301,4628.59,"That is what this legislation is seeking to account for, to make sure that the drivers are being paid no less than the Seattle minimum wage for large employers for the time that they spent working which means driving in the vehicle for all stages of the ride process and then also that they're paid for the reasonable expenses that they incur during the driving as well.",133,,
767,0.97,4628.59,4654.149,"I just wanted to raise that because I hear a lot of the drivers who are--of the Subset of drivers not supportive of this bill, I hear a lot of folks saying Oh, well, they're making X number of dollars per hour and the people supporting this bill just aren't doing it right.",134,,
768,0.97,4654.149,4678.073,"They aren't doing the job right or else they could be making more money, but the retort to that is you may consider yourself making X number of dollars an hour, but have you considered in order to really understand what your profits are as a worker, you need to take out all these other costs.",134,,
769,0.97,4678.073,4678.373,Exactly.,135,,
770,0.97,4678.373,4688.884,It's unclear when everyone is assessing it whether they're accounting for the reasonable expenses and also the time spent driving and waiting for a ride and the time spent driving to the ride.,135,,
771,0.97,4688.884,4695.724,There are a number of different things to consider when determining how much should be owed to a driver.,135,,
772,0.97,4695.724,4698.527,Thank you.,136,,
773,0.97,4698.527,4701.93,"Council member Herbold, Vice- chair, thank you for lifting that up.",137,,
774,0.97,4701.93,4720.615,"I think that's a really important point and also just to reiterate it's not only an important point we hear from drivers, it is exactly what played out in the Wright and Parrot study which we are continuing to reference in the legislation in front of us.",137,,
775,0.97,4720.615,4733.528,It's data driven solutions we are looking for base not only on anecdotes we hear from drivers repeatedly but also what the study bore out.,137,,
776,0.97,4733.528,4733.829,Good point.,137,,
777,0.97,4733.829,4734.129,Thank you.,137,,
778,0.97,4734.129,4748.143,This next line shows payment formula for the minimum compensation Standard and you'll see that the time will be paid out at no less than Seattle's minimum wage for reference.,138,,
779,0.97,4748.143,4752.047,This is the 2020 minimum wage for large employers.,138,,
780,0.97,4752.047,4752.547,It is $16.39.,138,,
781,0.97,4752.547,4760.655,I anticipate in the next few weeks or so we will hear from the office of labor standards what the 2021 standard will be.,138,,
782,0.97,4760.655,4761.89,It always goes up.,138,,
783,0.97,4761.89,4762.591,It never goes down.,138,,
784,0.97,4762.591,4776.805,That's something to keep in mind and then the permanent rate is multiplied by the number of minutes that the driver spend in the time period.,138,,
785,0.97,4776.805,4792.754,Then it's added to the number of miles that the driver is driving in the P3 period and multiplied times the per mile rate which you can see is a little bit less than that because of the utilization standard.,138,,
786,0.97,4792.754,4794.322,It is 0.830 per mile rate.,138,,
787,0.97,4794.322,4802.631,The important piece to communicate about this formula is the Ep3 time only represents one-third of the equation for how to pay drivers.,138,,
788,0.97,4802.631,4817.846,"So in order to figure out how to compensate drivers for that P1 and P2 time, the authors of the academic report developed a utilization rate.",138,,
789,0.97,4817.846,4830.859,We've been hearing a lot about that in the public comments and it is a key part of this minimum compensation standard to get drivers to the appropriate payment for all the time that they spend working.,138,,
790,0.97,4830.859,4861.59,"So the utilization rate measures how much time the drivers spend in their car driving in the P3 period and how many miles they are driving during the P3 period and it comes out that drivers are spending about a half hour of every hour with the passenger in the car and they're driving a little bit--since they're driving faster when they have a passenger in the car, their mileage rate is actually a little bit higher than just half of what it would be typically.",138,,
791,0.97,4861.59,4873.902,So what this means is that the utilization rate a in a percentage basis is about 49.2% of their time and then the mileage is 62.2% of their time.,138,,
792,0.97,4873.902,4890.485,"When figuring out the minimum compensation formula, it's the amount of minutes that the driver has driven times the per minute rate of the Seattle minimum wage divided by this utilization rate and then the same thing for the miles and that will get them to what they are supposed to earn.",138,,
793,0.97,4890.485,4902.197,The key part of this utilization rate is that it likely will not stay stagnant across time as the industry changes.,138,,
794,0.97,4902.197,4910.839,It is a dynamic calculation and so the legislation provides the office of labor standards an opportunity to change the utilization rate in the future.,138,,
795,0.97,4910.839,4917.912,So in the introduced legislation the office of labor standards can change it one year after the law goes into effect.,138,,
796,0.97,4919.681,4955.884,Any adjustment will take into account an assessment period that can last up to 12 months and the office of labor standards is required to provide advanced notice to the transportation network companies and the drivers and other interested Stakeholders of when this assessment period will happen before it happens which means that the public and the Tncs will always know when an assessment period is happening and that is the period of time that the office of labor standards will use to develop their basis for adjusting the utilization rate.,138,,
797,0.97,4960.188,4961.456,Any questions on that?,138,,
798,0.97,4961.456,4962.891,"Yes, council member Herbold.",138,,
799,0.97,4962.891,4977.305,"So just conceptually, that formula that you have where you have two numbers on the top and they're both--both numbers are divided by the utilization rate.",139,,
800,0.97,4977.305,4985.98,"In doing that, that makes it possible for drivers to be paid for P1 and P2 time.",139,,
801,0.97,4985.98,4999.494,"That is the formula because math isn't my strong suit, but the function of dividing the top number by the bottom number makes it possible to pay for that P1 and P2 time.",139,,
802,0.97,4999.494,5000.762,That is correct.,140,,
803,0.97,5000.762,5003.431,That is correct.,140,,
804,0.97,5003.431,5011.639,"I don't have the formula in my--I'm going to Scroll over to the memo that I wrote, if I can find it.",140,,
805,0.97,5011.639,5017.512,That's why I've got it Engrained in my brain from your memo.,141,,
806,0.97,5017.512,5072.3,"My question is the advance notice of the adjustments to the Tncs, does that create an opportunity, not that anybody would, to manipulate the utilization rates in a way, you know, by taking, for instance, either by putting a whole bunch of cars on the road or taking a whole bunch of cars off the road, tinkering with the amount of time I guess it would be taking cars off the road, if you in advance knew there was going to be an adjustment, could you take a whole bunch of cars off the road in advance of that adjustment so that there is a utilization rate that assumes less waiting time and less dispatch time?",141,,
807,0.97,5075.737,5076.771,That's an interesting question.,142,,
808,0.97,5076.771,5082.243,"I bet you wished I would have asked it about a week ago, right?",143,,
809,0.97,5082.243,5082.477,Sorry.,143,,
810,0.97,5082.477,5107.735,"The assessment period will reflect what is happening in Realtime and so since there is advance notice of when it's going to happen and since the Tncs are in control of how they operate their business model, it stands to reason that they are a control of whether or not to change what drivers are on the road to the extent they have the ability to do so.",144,,
811,0.97,5107.735,5130.125,"I would say that since the assessment period can be up to 12 months at least in the introduced legislation, the longer it is, I think perhaps if anyone is trying to reach a predetermined goal for the utilization rate, a year is a really long time in order to be enacting those kind of measures.",144,,
812,0.97,5130.125,5144.472,So a year would allow four seasons of driving to happen in order to measure what's happening on the road and what's happening with drivers and what passengers want.,144,,
813,0.97,5144.472,5158.186,"So I think that the longer that the assessment period is provides a better period of time to assess what's happening on the ground, so to speak.",144,,
814,0.97,5158.186,5159.621,That's helpful.,145,,
815,0.97,5159.621,5161.656,"So the assessment period, I did understand that.",145,,
816,0.97,5161.656,5170.498,"I knew we weren't going to do another assessment for three years, but the period of time under which the assessment is done is over the full period of time.",145,,
817,0.97,5170.498,5175.103,It's not like a spot check in three years or in a year.,145,,
818,0.97,5175.103,5175.403,Correct.,146,,
819,0.97,5175.403,5177.305,It is not a spot check.,146,,
820,0.97,5177.305,5190.418,"Just to jump ahead with a preview on the substitute bill, I think now is a really opportune time to talk about some of the changes that are in the substitute bill.",146,,
821,0.97,5190.418,5192.053,So I will Scroll ahead into that.,146,,
822,0.97,5195.356,5199.794,Right here you see I've lifted up the most salient changes in the substitute bill.,146,,
823,0.97,5199.794,5203.164,There are about five of them or so.,146,,
824,0.97,5203.164,5213.041,I'm going to jump ahead into the one that addresses utilization rates since it just Segways naturally into this conversation.,146,,
825,0.97,5213.041,5232.727,"As I mentioned in the introduced bill, the director would have the ability to adjust the utilization rate one year after the ordinance went into effect and the assessment period would be up to 12 months once again providing the advance notice to the public.",146,,
826,0.97,5232.727,5239.167,The substitute bill would change that delay into three years.,146,,
827,0.97,5239.167,5251.646,So the director would have to wait three years until after the ordinance was in effect in order to adjust both the utilization rate for time and mileage and the assessment period must be 12 months long.,146,,
828,0.97,5251.646,5254.115,That's not up to 12 months or less than 12 months.,146,,
829,0.97,5254.115,5265.693,"It must be 12 months again to account for the full Seasonality of what happens across the year, different driving happening in December than might happen in July that might happen in January.",146,,
830,0.97,5265.693,5272.5,So those are the two main components affecting the utilization rate in the substitute bill.,146,,
831,0.97,5274.135,5281.676,"Thank you for asking that, council member Herbold, and Karina, thank you as well for jumping ahead.",147,,
832,0.97,5281.676,5302.83,"I just want to note the importance and correct me if I'm saying this wrong, Karina, but I think the importance of us having this delay is also to try to get to whatever the new normal is for our local economy post Covid and also give that 12 month time frame to really do an apples to apples comparison for the different seasons within our local economy.",147,,
833,0.97,5302.83,5304.632,"Is that fair to say, Karina?",147,,
834,0.97,5304.632,5304.999,Absolutely.,148,,
835,0.97,5304.999,5322.216,I think everyone knows that the Covid emergency has had a dramatic--that it is an understatement--and very profound effect on the TNC industry and the rides that the drivers are getting and that are actually happening in Seattle.,148,,
836,0.97,5322.216,5334.862,So that could take a very long time to stabilize again and I don't think anyone knows what stabilization means in the industry after the Covid emergency is well.,148,,
837,0.97,5334.862,5339.6,So three years allows time for that to happen.,148,,
838,0.97,5343.971,5351.145,This gives us a little bit more time some people Referenced.,149,,
839,0.97,5351.145,5351.679,Council member Herbold.,149,,
840,0.97,5351.679,5361.589,I just want to again understand the concerns of both the platforms and some Subset of drivers.,150,,
841,0.97,5362.724,5372.934,"When they point to the New York model, they are pointing to a model that has a utilization rate.",150,,
842,0.97,5372.934,5380.508,Their basic opposition is an opposition to being paid for time while--for P1 and P2 time.,150,,
843,0.97,5380.508,5391.419,Does that kind of distill that issue in a way that's accurate?,150,,
844,0.97,5391.419,5437.165,"Is that--the concern is that by paying people for time while they're waiting, that that will essentially impact the number of drivers and if there are fewer drivers, that that somehow will from a driver's perspective the platform will take.",150,,
845,0.97,5437.165,5447.341,"Certainly some have expressed concern about the New York model that does have utilization rate it uses to pay drivers for P1, P2 and P3 time it.",151,,
846,0.97,5447.341,5447.842,Is currently 58%.,151,,
847,0.97,5447.842,5462.023,My understanding is it has not been changed since the law went into effect a while back and the transportation network companies have the discretion in order to change how many drivers on the road.,151,,
848,0.97,5462.023,5464.192,It's not regulated by the city to my knowledge.,151,,
849,0.97,5464.192,5468.529,I believe that is at the Tncs discretion.,151,,
850,0.97,5468.529,5510.238,"It certainly would be at the Tn this' discretion in Seattle as far as I know and the researchers for the study that the city commissioned, James Parrot and Michael Wright, forecasted that one way that the industry could respond to this payment standard could be to limit drivers on the road and the authors, I believe, saw that as a benefit because it could limit the number of cars on the road and it could maximize earnings of the if a utilization rate was changed to reflect that there were fewer drivers on the road, then that could result in drivers earning less per trip.",151,,
851,0.97,5511.839,5540.568,"However, they would be making more trips which would give them more money and so it would maximize earnings over time and if I think one would Posit--I'm no economist--that there is a flood of drivers on the road because this minimum compensation standard is this appealing, then right now the utilization rate is based on a half hour of driving around and getting to the passenger.",151,,
852,0.97,5540.568,5554.382,"If there are too many drivers on the road, one might imagine that that P1 and P2 time might be an hour long instead of a half hour long and the drivers wouldn't be compensated for that in this current formula.",151,,
853,0.97,5554.382,5564.392,So the formula wouldn't really represent their practice of what's actually happening and it actually might not get them to Seattle's minimum wage.,151,,
854,0.97,5564.392,5572.033,That's why it's important at least in my assessment for the utilization rate to change over time because it will reflect what is actually happening on the road.,151,,
855,0.97,5574.101,5574.535,Super helpful.,152,,
856,0.97,5574.535,5577.538,Thank you so much.,152,,
857,0.97,5579.206,5583.277,"This is, of course, not the only amendment in the substitute bill.",153,,
858,0.97,5583.277,5603.497,"We'll go back to the content, so to speak, for the other amendments and the first one is a minimum per trip amount and this amendment would establish payment for a minimum for trip amount that would require the Tncs to pay drivers $5 for each TNC dispatched trip.",153,,
859,0.97,5603.497,5617.912,"The way this would play out is that drivers would get either the minimum compensation formula, which is time plus mileage divided by that utilization rate, or they would get this minimum trip amount, whichever is greater.",153,,
860,0.97,5619.48,5634.462,"So for a driver who maybe is taking a passenger just a couple blocks down the road and might earn $2.80 using the minimum compensation formula, in this instance they would get at least $5 for their time.",153,,
861,0.97,5637.565,5638.699,"Sorry, Karina.",154,,
862,0.97,5638.699,5638.966,Go ahead.,154,,
863,0.97,5638.966,5639.333,Yeah.,155,,
864,0.97,5639.333,5643.371,This $5 would be increased each year to reflect the rate of inflation.,155,,
865,0.97,5643.371,5661.522,"So it's not a static amount over time and it doesn't cover every single trip that's dispatched to a driver, but I think an easy way to think about it is that it covers any time a passenger is in the car.",155,,
866,0.97,5661.522,5665.926,It covers No-Shows and it covers passenger and TNC cancellations.,155,,
867,0.97,5665.926,5669.363,It does not cover a trip canceled by the driver.,155,,
868,0.97,5669.363,5675.636,It does not cover cancellations that happen when the fee is actually refunded back to the passenger due to driver conduct.,155,,
869,0.97,5675.636,5683.31,So drivers know that they will get at least $5 each time they take a passenger from point to point B.,155,,
870,0.97,5683.31,5683.844,"Thank you, Karina.",156,,
871,0.97,5683.844,5687.415,"Colleagues, I think that this is an important addition to the legislation.",156,,
872,0.97,5687.415,5691.385,Many of us are used to the $5 cancellation fee already.,156,,
873,0.97,5691.385,5693.554,That's already part of the platform.,156,,
874,0.97,5693.554,5698.292,I think many users or riders are accustomed to that.,156,,
875,0.97,5698.292,5714.475,"This is also recognizing that if a driver passed on another fare to take someone just a few blocks down the street and it's maybe $3, they have passed on another opportunity.",156,,
876,0.97,5714.475,5716.61,So a minimum fee seems reasonable.,156,,
877,0.97,5716.61,5720.014,We're used to minimum fees in places of business across the city or country.,156,,
878,0.97,5720.014,5725.82,"If you go to a store, sometimes there's a $5 minimum, things like that to purchase.",156,,
879,0.97,5725.82,5732.126,"I think it makes sense for the drivers, especially if there's just a short trip involved.",156,,
880,0.97,5732.126,5752.079,One note that is in the introduced legislation there is a provision that would require the Tncs to pass on any cancellation fee charged to a passenger to the driver which is kind of like a minimum per trip amount but doesn't cover to the situations when there actually is P3 time.,157,,
881,0.97,5752.079,5761.322,So that provision is removed in the substitute bill and is essentially replaced and augmented by what is now the minimum per trip amount.,157,,
882,0.97,5763.124,5768.195,"Thank you, Karina.",158,,
883,0.97,5768.195,5768.462,Yeah.,159,,
884,0.97,5768.462,5776.871,"Next is a change to the reasonable intentions, mileage and Nonmilage expenses paid to drivers.",159,,
885,0.97,5776.871,5783.11,In the introduced legislation cleaning time and rest breaks are not included in the per mile rate.,159,,
886,0.97,5783.11,5790.818,So the substitute bill would compensate drivers for 30 minutes per day for vehicle cleaning.,159,,
887,0.97,5790.818,5811.338,"That would represent the two to three minutes between passengers that drivers could use the clean the vehicle during the Covid emergency, after the Covid emergency to prevent the spread of infectious disease and address other situations where maybe a larger event is happening like vomiting or bleeding in the car.",159,,
888,0.97,5811.338,5815.376,We heard from Dr. Baker about academic support and research on that issue.,159,,
889,0.97,5817.945,5830.791,The amendment also would increase the reasonable expenses per mile rate to account Forrest breaks which is a state mandated requirement for employees of ten minutes of paid rest period for four hours worked.,159,,
890,0.97,5830.791,5835.863,That would now apply to the TNC drivers in the form of additional compensation.,159,,
891,0.97,5835.863,5845.573,This is something similar that the city passed for domestic workers a number of years ago as well.,159,,
892,0.97,5845.573,5848.676,So there is precedent for the city taking this kind of action.,159,,
893,0.97,5848.676,5862.79,The combined per mile rate for both these additions to reasonable expenses would amount in a new per mile rate of 83 cents per mile.,159,,
894,0.97,5862.79,5874.501,"The per mile rate happens when you divide by the utilization rate, comes to a new per mile rate of $1.33.",159,,
895,0.97,5874.501,5883.577,So applying that to the full compensation standard for 2020 results in about 29.90 per hour.,159,,
896,0.97,5883.577,5895.689,I want to note for folks following along with the memo that was posted for this presentation that there was some Transposing of numbers in the memo regarding vehicle cleaning time and rest breaks.,159,,
897,0.97,5895.689,5902.83,So those have been corrected and you'll see a corrected version of the memo posted after the agenda.,159,,
898,0.97,5904.531,5906.533,"That you, Karina.",159,,
899,0.97,5906.533,5912.339,"Colleagues, this is the slide I'm most excited about because you all know I'm a total Nerd about health and public health.",159,,
900,0.97,5912.339,5915.809,So this combination here I think is really in the public health realm.,159,,
901,0.97,5915.809,5926.153,"Number one, I know all of you have been strong advocates for rest breaks for workers in the past.",159,,
902,0.97,5926.153,5935.095,"This is a public health issue as well as we see people driving across our city who need a moment to best, go to the bathroom perhaps, grab a snack, some water.",159,,
903,0.97,5935.095,5944.738,"It is really important that people have a chance to take a break so that they aren't driving with any kind of distraction, if they're tired, having a chance to recoup.",159,,
904,0.97,5944.738,5948.876,"This is a public health issue, especially as these drivers are across our city.",159,,
905,0.97,5948.876,5953.28,We want other drivers and pedestrians to be safe.,159,,
906,0.97,5955.716,5979.606,"The other important element here as it relates to the presentation from Dr. Baker is while there's a lot of attention now to making sure places of work, as Dr. Baker said, these cars are places of work, are safe and clean right now, there is going to be an ongoing need in the future to make sure all places of work are safe and clean for customers.",159,,
907,0.97,5979.606,5984.511,"That is important for to us Bake into the formula, the opportunity to have cleaning time paid for.",159,,
908,0.97,5984.511,6008.002,"Not only is it important for public health, but as our findings also say and was noted in the public testimony that the drivers are rewarded by of the ratings for their riders and if their car is not clean, that is also potentially harmful for the driver's ability to make wages they need to.",159,,
909,0.97,6008.002,6012.606,I think it's important to compensate for that time.,159,,
910,0.97,6012.606,6019.113,I'm kind of considering this list of items here for cleaning and rest breaks as a health combination.,159,,
911,0.97,6019.113,6081.208,"I feel these reasonable expenses include some of the same types of expenses that the Council required payment for in its premium pay legislation for food delivery drivers, I just want to thank Karina for drawing to our attention right before the meeting started a recent settlement from the office of labor standards of upwards of $361,000 for premium pay and so I think that really underscores for us here today the importance of recognizing these reasonable expenses and just want to also thank the Council and thank drivers for working with us to advocate for that premium pay legislation.",160,,
912,0.97,6082.943,6086.847,Excellent point.,161,,
913,0.97,6086.847,6088.715,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",161,,
914,0.97,6088.715,6089.716,"Additional comments, questions?",161,,
915,0.97,6089.716,6089.85,Okay.,161,,
916,0.97,6090.083,6094.021,So we talked about utilization rates.,162,,
917,0.97,6094.021,6106.8,The next amendment regards the transparency requirements that are in the legislation which require a variety of information to be shared with the drivers and with the passengers via an electronic receipt.,162,,
918,0.97,6106.8,6121.281,The drivers receive this information after each unique trip and they also receive a weekly notice of information that summarizes things for them.,162,,
919,0.97,6121.281,6150.677,So this transparency requirement would mandate drivers receive notice of what passengers pay for each trip and then the total of passenger fares for the prior week which means that the driver can look at how much they earned from each trip and look at how much the passenger paid for each trip and know what's happening as far as how their Tncs are charging for the trips as it compares to their earnings.,162,,
920,0.97,6150.677,6165.259,For passengers as well the Tncs would be providing notice for compensation paid to the driver with tips separately itemized and that's so passengers can also have a full awareness of what is happening with how much they pay and how much is going to the driver.,162,,
921,0.97,6166.026,6177.704,"I think this one is pretty self-explanatory, reminds me of the conversations we have about patrons potentially not tipping because they see a fee is included on a receipt.",163,,
922,0.97,6177.704,6179.806,So they know think it goes to the worker.,163,,
923,0.97,6179.806,6187.381,In this case we don't want the drivers to not receive a tip if the passenger believes it's getting passed on.,163,,
924,0.97,6187.381,6197.624,"I know that's probably no fault of the passenger, but having transparency is just critical for both the driver and for the passenger so that people can know how much the driver is making.",163,,
925,0.97,6201.562,6203.263,"Colleagues, questions?",163,,
926,0.97,6203.263,6203.463,Okay.,163,,
927,0.97,6203.463,6204.231,"Thank you, Karina.",163,,
928,0.97,6204.231,6216.61,"Next is a requirement in the legislation for study of this minimum compensation Standard and the other labor protections on the industry, on the drivers, on passengers, et cetera.",164,,
929,0.97,6216.61,6236.53,So the way it is Teed up in the introduced legislation is that Council would require the city auditor to perform this test and it would happen within two years after implementation and then Ols would have discretion whether or not to decide to do their own study after the first year of implementation.,164,,
930,0.97,6236.53,6250.944,With the amendment in the substitute bill all the responsibility for coordinating the studies would be assigned to office of labor standards since they've already begun this work and they would have the ability to do the study in the first year.,164,,
931,0.97,6250.944,6255.248,Council's study would turn from mandatory to permissive.,164,,
932,0.97,6255.248,6264.858,Council would have discretion on whether or not to ask for a study and it would be specified that the study would cover the first two years of implementation.,164,,
933,0.97,6264.858,6269.162,That's similar to the study that the Council commissioned for the secure scheduling.,164,,
934,0.97,6269.162,6276.97,It covers the first two years and the Council's request for study would be due within three years of implementation.,164,,
935,0.97,6276.97,6287.714,So what this amendment recognizes is that office of labor standards has done a baseline report and that they have the connections.,164,,
936,0.97,6287.714,6301.762,"They've already started this process and they estimate upwards to about 278,000 on per year of conducting a study when the city auditor does a study.",164,,
937,0.97,6301.762,6319.546,"Both would contract with academic researchers, but the studies are quite vast and cents Steph and could and compressive and there are several things going into this amendment and assigning the study to Ols.",164,,
938,0.97,6319.546,6322.182,"Thank you, Karina, for reaching out to auditor Jones.",165,,
939,0.97,6322.182,6324.618,"Folks, we worked with the city auditor's office.",165,,
940,0.97,6324.618,6344.237,In talking with them I think it's clear office of labor standards being the entity that has already worked with the authors of the report or the study are greatly positioned or in a good position to follow up on that assessment that's done and continue to track this in Realtime.,165,,
941,0.97,6344.237,6352.546,So I appreciate the conversations we've had with the auditor and they're also I think have a lot on their plate.,165,,
942,0.97,6352.546,6357.784,"So does Ols, but I think this is a better fit.",165,,
943,0.97,6357.784,6358.251,"Comments, questions?",165,,
944,0.97,6358.251,6358.452,Okay.,165,,
945,0.97,6358.452,6358.885,"Thank you, Karina.",165,,
946,0.97,6358.885,6361.588,And that brings us to the end of the amendments.,166,,
947,0.97,6361.588,6371.164,"There are several other items in the memo, add additions to findings which are already Referenced.",166,,
948,0.97,6371.164,6375.402,They talk about the justification for adding cleaning time and rest breaks.,166,,
949,0.97,6375.402,6376.269,There are some technical changes.,166,,
950,0.97,6376.269,6385.612,There were some revisions to penalties and fines to reflect the fact now office of labor standards knows what the rate of inflation will be for 2021.,166,,
951,0.97,6385.612,6404.931,"So those penalties and fines could be updated immediately in the legislation rather than it always being a year behind and the next steps for this legislation are a vote, a consideration of the substitute bill and then there's an opportunity for a full council vote on Tuesday, September 29th, the next full council meeting.",166,,
952,0.97,6406.633,6410.137,"Karina, this was a very helpful presentation.",167,,

1057,0.97,6833.56,6842.101,"Thanks for being here today to talk with us about homelessness prevention, rental assistance and homeowner support the city is making in response to the Covid emergency.",203,,
1058,0.97,6842.101,6848.608,We know many of us continue to say stay home to stay healthy and you have to have a home to stay healthy in these times.,203,,
1059,0.97,6848.608,6887.68,Much of what you're doing in front of us today is making it possible for people to stay healthy especially during this economic recession for people to keep a home or prevent them from falling into homelessness and we know this has a racial equity lens to it recognizing that people of color or black indigenous or people of color population is more likely to face housing insecurity and homelessness and especially right now the compounding health crises with those living outside having not just higher risk exposure to Covid but also having to breathe the poor air we've had the last ten days.,203,,
1060,0.97,6887.68,6897.523,"I appreciate all the work you've done, looking forward to hearing more about the ways in which we can help people stay home, get shelter and stay healthy.",203,,

1065,0.97,6911.137,6914.14,She had to go to a board meeting.,204,,
1066,0.97,6914.14,6926.886,She said she would follow up with comments to Council just to talk more from her perspective as a black led organization in the urban League.,204,,

1069,0.97,6930.49,6933.026,I did not know she had a hard stop.,205,,
1070,0.97,6933.026,6935.528,I will reach out to her as well.,205,,
1071,0.97,6935.528,6946.839,We really appreciate the work that they do and thank you for flagging that.,205,,
1072,0.97,6946.839,6947.607,I'll jump in.,206,,
1073,0.97,6947.607,6959.285,"This is breaking down and looking at what approach we are looking into on the Covid-19 rental assistance, homelessness prevention and homeowner support.",206,,
1074,0.97,6959.285,7001.594,"I want to start out by thank city Council and the Mayor for committing this significant amount of resource to help stablize Renters and homeowners and just to give a little background and I know Council member Mosqueda, you already set us up pretty well, but the Census Bureau has been releasing these weekly pulse surveys during Covid and for the Seattle area from the September 7th to September 14th weekly survey we learned that 14% of all Renters are not currently caught up on rent payments and we saw so strikingly the racial disparities in those who are not caught up on rent.",206,,
1075,0.97,7001.594,7005.932,58% of black Renter households are currently not caught up on rent.,206,,
1076,0.97,7005.932,7015.842,22% of Latino households are not currently caught up on rent as compared to 5% of white households.,206,,
1077,0.97,7015.842,7020.78,"Looking ahead, 17% of Renters have no or only slight confidence about making next month's rent payment.",206,,
1078,0.97,7021.848,7038.598,"So really the work that we're doing to insure that there's both access to rent assistance, that there's targeted strategies for homelessness prevention is critical racial equity work during Covid.",206,,
1079,0.97,7038.598,7042.935,So in today's briefing I wanted to cover a few things.,206,,
1080,0.97,7042.935,7059.619,"I know we've had a series of fun sources come together and a series of strategies for how we can spend those resources, want to talk about homelessness prevention and turn it over to my team member Erika Malone to talk about homeowner supports.",206,,
1081,0.97,7063.523,7075.968,"So first of all, the most significant of funds is really focused on rental Assistanc and our strategy for rent assistance when we came to Council many months ago and talked about rent assistance was really threefold.",206,,
1082,0.97,7075.968,7091.717,First it was looking at how do we get broad awareness out with an easy one stop place to access rent assistance while also making sure that's delivered in a way that's focusing on racial equity?,206,,
1083,0.97,7091.717,7097.023,We did so that way by creating the United way rent assistance program and we'll talk more about that.,206,,
1084,0.97,7097.023,7104.63,The second part of our broader strategy was really about addressing nonpayment of rent and city funded affordable housing.,206,,
1085,0.97,7104.63,7135.261,"So these are units the city has invested in where there are low income households who live in those units and because of an inability to go to work, job loss or other insecurity people can't pay rent and we're working to stabilize folks in the Lh portfolio and the third part of this three-part strategy was really looking at how do we make sure we're doing targeted homeless prevention building off the expertise of the programs we have in place and we'll talk more about that.",206,,
1086,0.97,7135.261,7139.532,"Breaking down money here, $12 million we are contracting to the United way of King County's home base program.",206,,
1087,0.97,7139.532,7142.702,You'll hear from Lauren about some of the detail there.,206,,
1088,0.97,7142.702,7146.772,Of that 4 million is from the C.A.R.E.S.,206,,
1089,0.97,7146.772,7158.417,Act Crf with the Timeline of which those funds must be expended by 2020 and 8 million of the contracted of United way will be for 2021 money from the city's emergency funds.,206,,
1090,0.97,7158.417,7171.831,We have $4 million from the Crf fund as well expended through the end of this year that will be administered through the office of housing for city funded affordable housing residents.,206,,
1091,0.97,7175.601,7200.326,"You're about to hear from Lauren, but to talk more about the fact we have two years now to do a strategy to really support Renters and support Renters with a focus on racial equity, our strategic framework for the contract with United way really has two parts.",206,,
1092,0.97,7200.326,7204.63,"One,2020, we have three months to get dollars out the door and serve as many people as we can.",206,,
1093,0.97,7204.63,7219.145,United way will talk about how they are intending to leverage some existing systems in place including partnership with King County who just launched a rent assistance program and they're going to incorporate additional strategies to improve racial equity outcomes.,206,,
1094,0.97,7219.145,7248.107,"In 2021 United way will do a little bit of a pivot and Leveraging their older Home- based model that focuses more on Eviction prevention in partnership with folks like the housing justice project to really think about how once the Eviction moratorium LIFTS from Seattle, from other parts, from the state, from the Feds, how do we make sure that those most at risk of Eviction are those that we're targeting our resources towards?",206,,
1095,0.97,7248.107,7254.847,I'm going to turn it over to Lauren to talk more about home base.,206,,
1096,0.97,7254.847,7255.114,Great.,207,,
1097,0.97,7255.114,7255.915,"Thanks, Emily.",207,,
1098,0.97,7258.017,7262.054,"Thanks, Council members, for having us here today and for all of your support.",207,,
1099,0.97,7262.054,7282.508,It's incredible to live in a community that both understands that it's unacceptable that so many people in our region experience homelessness and housing insecurity and that we are investing so much in rental assistance and Eviction prevention.,207,,
1100,0.97,7282.508,7299.125,"We all know that we had a homelessness crisis before the pandemic, that far too many people were falling into homelessness particularly because of Evictions and that's why we launched the home basis project.",207,,
1101,0.97,7299.125,7302.628,"That program helped over 1,000 households stay in their homes.",207,,
1102,0.97,7302.628,7316.942,Over 70% of them were Ipoc families and we really were able to both provide flexible financial assistance and legal services to keep those folk this their homes.,207,,
1103,0.97,7316.942,7347.94,"Unfortunately when Covid hit, so many more people became unstable and we all know as Emily just pointed out how many people are behind in rent, are taking out enormous debt in order to be able to pay rent and who are falling behind simply because they're not able to work, they're taking care of their kids and not able to meet their rent during this challenging time.",207,,
1104,0.97,7347.94,7359.418,We are so grateful that you and the county and local Philanthropy stepped up to help us pivot the home base program from a Court-Based Eviction strategy into a rental assistance program this spring.,207,,
1105,0.97,7362.188,7368.327,"And because of that, over 8,400 individuals across King County were served between April and July.",207,,
1106,0.97,7369.695,7389.115,More than 70% of those households that received rental assistance were families of color and we were able to form really important partnerships with many of the landlords and property management companies to negotiate payments less than we initially expected.,207,,
1107,0.97,7389.115,7393.419,"When we started this partnership, we thought we'd help about 2,000 households.",207,,
1108,0.97,7393.419,7402.995,"We were able to help over 3,000 and in many cases for multiple months because we were able to stretch those dollars further because of the negotiated rates.",207,,
1109,0.97,7402.995,7403.362,Thank you.,208,,
1110,0.97,7403.362,7415.141,"Just one second before we go on, I know Council member Herbold had a quick question related to I think the previous slide, but I wanted to make sure we got that in before we got too far if that's okay, Lauren.",208,,
1111,0.97,7415.141,7416.842,Thank you.,209,,
1112,0.97,7416.842,7426.752,The question that I was hoping to get to relates to the number of individuals served between April and July.,209,,
1113,0.97,7426.752,7434.827,"The slide says that there are 8,400 individuals served, but it doesn't give a sense of how many people applied.",209,,
1114,0.97,7436.195,7439.698,I'm assuming that we weren't able to help everybody who applied.,209,,
1115,0.97,7439.698,7450.876,So it would be helpful to understand how many people applied requested the assistance and also for the viewing public it would be useful to know whether or not you're still accepting new applications.,209,,
1116,0.97,7454.58,7454.847,Yeah.,210,,
1117,0.97,7454.847,7458.451,"Great questions, council member.",210,,
1118,0.97,7458.451,7461.62,"We received over 7,000 applications in a 48 hour period.",210,,
1119,0.97,7461.62,7462.488,Those are households.,210,,
1120,0.97,7462.488,7470.396,"So we ended up serving just over 3,000 of those households.",210,,
1121,0.97,7470.396,7478.103,About 50% of those that were not served were not served because they were not eligible for some reason.,210,,
1122,0.97,7478.103,7493.519,They didn't fit the income criteria . They were able to pay their rents in different ways or their landlord or property management company wouldn't take the negotiated payment rate.,210,,
1123,0.97,7493.519,7515.808,"There are still families we are helping from that initial process, but we are now out of funds for that process and we were never able to reopen it to serve the thousands and thousands of folks that were calling our offices, the urban League, well spring and many other agencies all across the region, but now that there are C.A.R.E.S.",210,,
1124,0.97,7515.808,7516.141,Act funds --,210,,
1125,0.97,7516.141,7524.65,"Lauren, am I right to say, also, of the 3,000 households that you're citing 1,238 approximately were in Seattle?",211,,
1126,0.97,7524.65,7525.851,That is exactly correct.,212,,
1127,0.97,7525.851,7531.156,A reference of Seattle relative to the rest of the county.,213,,
1128,0.97,7531.156,7532.625,Thank you.,214,,
1129,0.97,7532.625,7535.828,"Yes, Emily, you are correct.",215,,
1130,0.97,7535.828,7539.298,What we know now is King County government has used their C.A.R.E.S.,215,,
1131,0.97,7539.298,7542.101,Act funds to launch a rental assistance process.,215,,
1132,0.97,7543.402,7553.712,They have a lottery that individuals across our community can be applying for right now.,215,,
1133,0.97,7553.712,7562.221,"There are over 3,000 households from the city of Seattle that have applied for that lottery and many more that are probably eligible but don't know about it yet.",215,,
1134,0.97,7562.221,7586.812,"So our plan with these dollars is to raise awareness about that lottery Ticketly for Seattle residents, particularly for those Fipa families and families who may not be hearing about that lottery in different ways and then work with the county to insure that those Seattle residents are served.",215,,
1135,0.97,7586.812,7591.75,So we will accept--individuals can go Online.,215,,
1136,0.97,7591.75,7595.454,They can go to our Website and click through to enter that lottery.,215,,
1137,0.97,7595.454,7603.862,Seattle residents will be forwarded to the United way Home-Based partnership and one of our agency partners will serve those residents.,215,,
1138,0.97,7606.966,7610.135,We think this strategy will help make sure these C.A.R.E.S.,215,,
1139,0.97,7610.135,7625.884,"Act dollars get spent by the end of the calendar year, which is really critical, and it provides a one-stop place for everyone whether they're in Seattle or another part of the county to go to access these funds.",215,,
1140,0.97,7625.884,7629.421,We also know the need is bigger than these dollars will allow us to do.,215,,
1141,0.97,7629.421,7641.133,That's why we along with our partners are continuing to advocate for additional rent relief from the Federal Government and why United way is committed to continuing to raise money from local Philanthropy.,215,,
1142,0.97,7641.133,7650.409,"It's got to be a mix of both, but we are still going to need significant Federal dollars as we head into 2021.",215,,
1143,0.97,7655.314,7661.387,"As we look at the next slide, there's sort of two phases to this work.",215,,
1144,0.97,7661.387,7662.921,It's the rental assistance piece.,215,,
1145,0.97,7662.921,7667.593,"That includes urban League, solid ground, well spring family services, neighborhood house.",215,,
1146,0.97,7667.593,7679.571,Well also partner very closely with the housing Connector and I can't say enough about how important these partnerships with landlords and property management companies are.,215,,
1147,0.97,7679.571,7699.925,Really working with them to take these discounts rates and stretch dollars as far as we can and have a clause that families can't be evicted for economic reasons during this time I think will help at least relieve some stress from the families that we're all trying to serve.,215,,
1148,0.97,7704.463,7730.022,"As we move into 2021, the additional funds of $8 million are really going to help us focus back in who is most likely to be evicted in Seattle and provide a combination of legal services and debt repayment through flexible financial assistance to keep people from being evicted and that is going to be a lot of work, folks.",215,,
1149,0.97,7730.022,7737.362,We know the number of people that are going to face Evictions is really at a crisis point.,215,,
1150,0.97,7737.362,7742.868,And so we're excited to have these funds.,215,,
1151,0.97,7742.868,7755.914,"I think this will help spur some creative thinking, some good partnerships and develop a very Equity-Focused strategy for keeping people in their homes.",215,,
1152,0.97,7760.819,7781.607,"So right now if folks in our community are looking for rental assistance, they can visit our Website that will take them to the King County lottery and we will continue to work in the weeks to come to increase awareness of that process.",215,,
1153,0.97,7781.607,7783.108,Folks can apply at any time.,215,,
1154,0.97,7783.108,7785.878,The lottery is pulled once a week.,215,,
1155,0.97,7785.878,7814.273,"So whether you apply today or next week, there's still time for our Seattle families to do that and United way is very committed to working with our community partners to increase awareness of those services and then insure we do everything we can to get families that are pulled from that lottery, get them qualified as quickly as possible, get funding out the door so we can continue to serve more families.",215,,
1156,0.97,7815.44,7834.66,"One thing I want to mention if I could jump in, Lauren, is part of why we're Leveraging the county's system is that they have a couple things in place already that we think are really critical, one, the application and process has been translated into all of the--is it 11 languages?",216,,
1157,0.97,7834.66,7835.327,It's over 20.,217,,
1158,0.97,7835.327,7836.962,Over 20 languages.,218,,
1159,0.97,7836.962,7839.431,So that language access piece is already built in.,218,,
1160,0.97,7839.431,7842.901,That was going to be something we would otherwise spend money on.,218,,
1161,0.97,7842.901,7862.221,So how we can then help support this work is by our targeted outreach and engagement with other kinds of Seattle Community-Based organizations who can work with their clients and partners and community members to insure that there are applications that are headed into this system.,218,,
1162,0.97,7863.322,7864.623,Council member Herbold.,218,,
1163,0.97,7865.924,7866.792,Thanks.,219,,
1164,0.97,7866.792,7893.352,"I just want to note, too, I believe that the Council in our last allocation or plan to allocate funds for this purpose also expressed an interest in a fund that was targeted towards small landlords and as I understand it, the county rent assistance program already has that.",219,,
1165,0.97,7893.352,7900.459,So that's another I think good reason to leverage the county's new program because they have built in a component that was a high priority to this Council.,219,,
1166,0.97,7904.429,7910.669,Absolutely.,220,,
1167,0.97,7910.669,7911.069,Other questions?,220,,
1168,0.97,7911.069,7913.338,Otherwise I'll keep going.,220,,
1169,0.97,7913.338,7914.506,Please keep going.,221,,
1170,0.97,7914.506,7918.877,I have a few questions I'll told till the end.,221,,
1171,0.97,7918.877,7920.345,Okay.,222,,
1172,0.97,7920.345,7930.522,Our next key approach around rental assistance will be the $4 million I discussed earlier that will be allocated to the office of housing.,222,,
1173,0.97,7930.522,7933.525,We'll administer it to our city funded housing portfolio.,222,,
1174,0.97,7933.525,7941.066,"Just to give a reminder, we already, Council and the Mayor, allocated 1.4 million previously to support this work.",222,,
1175,0.97,7941.066,7951.81,"We made awards to 17 agencies that applied for that assistance and there were 1,238 original households who needed assistance.",222,,
1176,0.97,7954.98,7968.493,"For transparency, it is CDBG, so we're working slowly to make sure we're cutting checks to those households.",222,,
1177,0.97,7968.493,7978.603,We are seeing in our office of housing subsidized portfolio in June and July a precipitous increase in the amount of nonpayment of rent.,222,,
1178,0.97,7978.603,7990.515,So we're really hopeful that this $4 million will have a meaningful impact in stabilizing some of those significantly At-Risk low income tenants who are already in subsidized housing.,222,,
1179,0.97,7998.357,8004.73,We also allocated $2.8 million of CDBG into homelessness prevention programs.,222,,
1180,0.97,8004.73,8018.443,"As you well know, the Seattle housing levy and other funds have been used many years by the city to support homelessness prevention with contracts through many Community-Based organizations.",222,,
1181,0.97,8018.443,8026.852,You see some of those community partners listed there and we intend to continue and grow the contracts with those agencies in order to deliver this $2.8 million.,222,,
1182,0.97,8026.852,8031.189,I'll say that I think that these strategies really work together.,222,,
1183,0.97,8031.189,8047.873,"You see a range of agencies that are meeting that have different kinds of cultural Competencies, community connections, language access and they'll be very well positioned to serve diverse populations across the city.",222,,
1184,0.97,8052.11,8062.854,So that is sum of rent strategies and I can turn it over to Erika to talk about what we are doing to stabilize homeowners unless there are questions.,222,,
1185,0.97,8062.854,8066.525,Could we go back one slide here real quick.,223,,
1186,0.97,8068.293,8080.005,"On the community partners piece and also in partnership with the slide where you showed the community partners, there's a question from one of our colleagues about the administrative support.",223,,
1187,0.97,8080.005,8088.68,How much administrative support are we able to get to the people of color led organizations for their own Admin and rental assistance for folks?,223,,
1188,0.97,8088.68,8095.921,I know we're asking a lot of our community partners here and wanting to make sure we're giving them that support.,223,,
1189,0.97,8095.921,8107.866,"And the other question is about how much total money is going to our community partners, people of color led organizations versus the overall costs for Admin?",223,,
1190,0.97,8115.073,8116.041,Good questions.,224,,
1191,0.97,8116.041,8123.949,I echo your colleague's interest and commitment to providing capacity and support for the agencies doing this important work and I often think we overlook that.,224,,
1192,0.97,8123.949,8125.45,So thanks for that question.,224,,
1193,0.97,8125.45,8130.822,I will need to confirm the rate of the homelessness prevention contracts to date.,224,,
1194,0.97,8130.822,8141.433,"I believe that they were running at about 10% Admin for those contracts and, Lauren, do you have information on United way?",224,,
1195,0.97,8141.433,8141.766,Yeah.,225,,
1196,0.97,8141.766,8158.283,"For this particular grant there is I believe a cap of 10%, but what United way is doing is Leveraging some philanthropic dollars to increase capacity because in general the C.A.R.E.S.",225,,
1197,0.97,8158.283,8162.354,Act money has been really challenging with Admin caps.,225,,
1198,0.97,8162.354,8166.858,Thank you.,226,,
1199,0.97,8166.858,8192.984,"Just on this rental assistance, Traci, I'm hoping before we wrap up if there's a possibility for us to do a quick comparison at the end on how much money went into these assistance programs from the jump start Covid relief assistance bucket and it might take a minute to dig that up, but sort of our original projections and then what ended up going over would be helpful.",226,,
1200,0.97,8192.984,8199.257,"So if I could ping you on that, we can come back later, too, that's helpful.",226,,
1201,0.97,8199.257,8199.724,"Thank you, Traci.",226,,
1202,0.97,8201.026,8201.326,All right.,226,,
1203,0.97,8201.326,8204.262,Let's keep going.,226,,
1204,0.97,8210.635,8211.136,Thank you.,227,,
1205,0.97,8211.136,8214.573,"Erika, do you want to talk about our homeowner supports?",227,,
1206,0.97,8214.573,8214.739,Is.,227,,
1207,0.97,8214.739,8215.974,Glad to.,228,,
1208,0.97,8215.974,8227.953,First I want to echo gratitude to the Council and Mayor for coming up with these really vital resources to keep people housed in this important time.,228,,
1209,0.97,8227.953,8246.137,"$700,000 are going to counseling agencies to advocate for homeowners with their Servicers and half of that is going directly to those counseling services and is half will go to direct foreclosure prevention loans.",228,,
1210,0.97,8246.137,8288.98,"We are currently using levy funds to provide silent second deferred until resale or refinanced loans to homeowners, income eligible homeowners at or below 80% of very median income in order to become current on their mortgage, pay back taxes and/or homeownership Association dues and that's actually a really great use of those funds that not a lot of foreclosure prevention funding is able to be used for, those other sort of ancillary housing costs.",228,,
1211,0.97,8288.98,8333.425,"So we have a great partnership with home site who is doing direct lending of those foreclosure protection loans and with the Washington resource center we're undertaking the community outreach strategy in partnership with them to insure that our most vulnerable home owning neighbors are aware of this opportunity for both advocacy and counseling, but also the direct financial support that is available, both through housing levy funds and these new resources as well.",228,,
1212,0.97,8333.425,8346.838,We're working with several specific community media organizations hopefully placing a future article of someone who has been helped through these resources along with some strategic ad placement.,228,,
1213,0.97,8346.838,8360.485,We've also translated just a brief Blurb if you're having trouble making your house payment.,228,,
1214,0.97,8360.485,8367.759,"We're working on getting the word out as far and wide as possible so folks can access these really, really important resources.",228,,
1215,0.97,8367.759,8396.388,"It's also worth pointing out, Erika, the Washington homeowners resource center is a statewide nonprofit designed to support homeowners and as we drive homeowners to them to get support, they have complete live language translation and access to really be supporting a range of folks.",229,,
1216,0.97,8396.388,8413.338,"Home site is a Cdfi in Southeast Seattle and has a long history of working with diverse populations in Bipoc households already is, we're building off our levy partnerships to expand this new resource of $700,000.",229,,
1217,0.97,8413.338,8414.005,Council member Herbold.,229,,
1218,0.97,8414.005,8414.272,Thank you.,230,,
1219,0.97,8417.776,8449.974,"Does anybody know whether or not the King County sheriff's order to not be--aside from the Eviction moratorium, the King County sheriff issued a policy that not only would she not be exercising Evictions that were, of course, covered by the Eviction moratorium, but that she was not going to be doing the foreclosures, does anybody know if that's still in place?",230,,
1220,0.97,8452.377,8452.811,I do not know.,231,,
1221,0.97,8455.613,8460.285,There are various moratoriums for Federally-Backed mortgages that are in place.,231,,
1222,0.97,8460.285,8462.12,Many folks are in forbearance now.,231,,
1223,0.97,8462.12,8470.495,There are some privately held mortgages that certainly could go forward in the foreclosure process.,231,,
1224,0.97,8470.495,8474.466,I'm not sure where the sheriff stands on actually removing people.,231,,
1225,0.97,8474.466,8486.544,We don't know whether or not people are being kicked out of their homes because of--it just seems like we have this program to help people from being kicked out of their homes because of their inability to pay their mortgage.,232,,
1226,0.97,8486.544,8492.116,We would have some sort of an idea what the current practices are.,232,,
1227,0.97,8492.116,8525.183,"I understand we want to help people pay their debts regardless whether or not not paying their debts results in their being kicked out of their homes, but it would be helpful to know whether or not that practice is not being carried out by the sheriff any longer consistent with the decision that she made, whatever it was, back in April or whether or not the sheriff has now resumed enforcing foreclosures.",232,,
1228,0.97,8526.684,8533.458,I'd be happy to look more into the sheriff's actions and how that's playing out locally and I'll get back to you.,233,,
1229,0.97,8533.458,8547.972,I think Erika did present this morning at our levy oversight Commission some more information about what's happening generally in the homeownership market.,233,,
1230,0.97,8547.972,8556.614,"Erika, you're probably better off describing, but how we're planning for intervention is we're Notseeing the need of immediate intervention at the foreclosure mode now.",233,,
1231,0.97,8556.614,8563.154,We anticipate that that will happen for particularly at risk households this 2021.,233,,
1232,0.97,8563.154,8569.093,So a worry really taking an approach to supporting folks first with awareness knowing that that wave will be coming later.,233,,
1233,0.97,8569.093,8572.196,"Erika, did I say that wrong?",233,,
1234,0.97,8572.196,8572.73,"No, that's right.",234,,
1235,0.97,8572.73,8582.206,Most--90% of mortgage holders in Washington right now are covered by the various Federal foreclosure moratoriums.,234,,
1236,0.97,8582.206,8591.983,"Many are in forbearance and the first wave of folks coming out of loan forbearance is likely to be in early spring, late winter, February.",234,,
1237,0.97,8591.983,8595.453,So we're hoping to get the information out.,234,,
1238,0.97,8595.453,8606.297,"So if we'll are anticipating having trouble making their housing payments once their forbearance is expired, that they would know where to find resources, advocacy and financial support.",234,,
1239,0.97,8608.967,8609.534,Thank you.,235,,
1240,0.97,8609.534,8609.801,So Yeah.,235,,
1241,0.97,8609.801,8625.917,"My question is of the mortgages that are not covered by the moratorium, do we know whether or not there are Court-Ordered foreclosures that are being enforced by the King County sheriff?",235,,
1242,0.97,8625.917,8633.024,And I just think it's important for us to know that in our assessment of how to help people.,235,,
1243,0.97,8633.024,8637.629,That just I think is information that is useful in allowing us to do that.,235,,
1244,0.97,8637.629,8638.262,Agreed.,236,,
1245,0.97,8638.262,8639.163,To make that assessment.,237,,
1246,0.97,8642.1,8642.467,Absolutely.,238,,
1247,0.97,8642.467,8642.934,Thanks for that.,238,,
1248,0.97,8642.934,8644.969,We have about five more minutes.,239,,
1249,0.97,8644.969,8647.205,It looks like we're at the end of that presentation.,239,,
1250,0.97,8647.205,8652.977,Are there any other questions on this first topic from our friends from housing?,239,,
1251,0.97,8656.714,8659.283,Please pass on our appreciation to urban League.,239,,
1252,0.97,8659.283,8664.656,We will make sure to reach out as well.,239,,
1253,0.97,8664.656,8668.159,"Not seeing additional questions, thank you so much.",239,,
1254,0.97,8668.159,8677.001,"Traci, I'm not sure if we want to follow up on that question later, just wanted to highlight some of the money that came from the Covid jump start relief package.",239,,
1255,0.97,8677.001,8685.643,I know it was a combination of funding announced earlier with the 19 million that went out this year.,239,,
1256,0.97,8685.643,8699.957,"A portion of that came from jump start, but given the hard work that went into the packet from this Council, is there any amount you might want to highlight for this council as well?",239,,
1257,0.97,8699.957,8703.628,I don't know if you guys can see me.,240,,
1258,0.97,8703.628,8704.095,We can.,241,,
1259,0.97,8704.095,8704.762,"Oh, good.",242,,
1260,0.97,8704.762,8707.865,I lost you on my screen trying find some other documents.,242,,
1261,0.97,8707.865,8732.59,"What I can tell you for sure is in the agreement we reached with the executive on the $45 million amount utilizing emergency funds, $8 million will actually be allocated in 2021 for rental Assistances and I believe the intent is that $8 million would go to the United way, King County as they discussed to address the post Eviction moratorium likely activity that will happen.",242,,
1262,0.97,8733.658,8746.671,"I can't access the document about what we had looked at in terms of the proposed $96 million originally, but I can find that and get it to you after the meeting.",242,,
1263,0.97,8746.671,8752.043,"Thank you very much, really appreciate all of that work.",243,,
1264,0.97,8752.043,8763.855,It sounds like our original bill included 19.5 million for existing homelessness prevention programs and rental assistance programs for individuals and the United way home based program and others.,243,,
1265,0.97,8763.855,8789.313,"I want to highlight this because I think it's really important to show we don't get to see tangible Widgets that the Council and Mayor produce and it's nice to see this report to show how that effort is really translating into assistance, but I think one of the things that you mentioned, Lauren, and I believe has been reiterated by other Brenters is a portion of the folks that have applied are getting through the door.",243,,
1266,0.97,8789.313,8802.56,"So we'll continue to look to you all and Council member Herbold, Vice-Chair of the committee, really lifting up the need and unmet need out there will be helpful for us to know when considering the upcoming budget.",243,,
1267,0.97,8802.56,8804.562,Thank you all so much.,244,,
1268,0.97,8804.562,8806.097,Thank you very much.,245,,
1269,0.97,8806.097,8812.136,"I'm really appreciative of your time, Erika, Lauren.",246,,
1270,0.97,8812.136,8814.238,I might be keeping you on the line.,246,,
1271,0.97,8814.238,8817.708,You're keeping Erika on the line.,247,,
1272,0.97,8817.708,8818.643,Thank you very much.,248,,
1273,0.97,8818.643,8828.419,"With that why don't we move on to item number on our agenda today, which is our last item for consideration with our revised agenda.",248,,
1274,0.97,8828.419,8831.756,Do you mind reading item number two into the record.,248,,
1275,0.97,8831.756,8861.219,"Agenda item number two, council bill 119 had 890, an ordinance relating to the transfer of city real property for housing development; transferring the jurisdiction of a 1-Foot strip of the property from the office of housing to the Department of Transportation for Right-Of-Way purposes.",249,,
1276,0.97,8863.02,8895.786,"This is a small but really exciting piece of legislation to enable the city to utilize city-owned property to be used for public services, public benefits such as affordable housing and to make sure that that property gets a chance to be transferred to the city, I'm sorry, to enable the city and Utility-Owned properties to be transferred at no cost beginning with community and housing advocates pushing for this policy change.",250,,
1277,0.97,8895.786,8899.023,Today we are here taking our next step.,250,,
1278,0.97,8899.023,8911.602,"As we know, the price of land is continuing to increase in Seattle and has over the last decade and there's greater competition for living in this area regardless of this recession as we've seen from the National Statistics.",250,,
1279,0.97,8911.602,8924.115,Folks in this area largely continue to see income gap widen and people at the highest incomes continuing to make salaries and purchase homes.,250,,
1280,0.97,8924.115,8931.122,The cost of housing continues to go up and there's very competitive market out there.,250,,
1281,0.97,8931.122,8940.965,With greater competition it's important for us to continue looking at building afford panel housing and I'm really excited about this piece of legislation.,250,,
1282,0.97,8940.965,8946.037,I'll turn it over to Traci or Erika.,250,,
1283,0.97,8946.037,8948.739,I'll let Traci kick this off perhaps.,250,,
1284,0.97,8948.739,8967.491,We're here in some respects to complete the process we actually started I think a year ago when we authorized transfer of this surplus city property for the purposes of disposing of it to an eligible housing developer for affordable homeownership.,251,,
1285,0.97,8967.491,8975.299,"They have done the Rp, identified the developer and are ready to formally transfer that property to the nonprofit developer.",251,,
1286,0.97,8975.299,8977.568,So that's what this legislation would do.,251,,
1287,0.97,8977.568,8984.909,I'll let Erika talk about what it is they're going to develop on that piece of property.,251,,
1288,0.97,8984.909,8985.376,"Thanks, J.C.",252,,
1289,0.97,8985.376,8988.179,It was a year ago to the day when I was building the slides.,252,,
1290,0.97,8988.179,8993.584,All I had to do was change the here.,252,,
1291,0.97,8993.584,8994.785,That's amazing.,253,,
1292,0.97,8994.785,9002.927,Just a quick refresher.,254,,
1293,0.97,9002.927,9019.243,"This is a piece of property in loyal heights, close to transit, close to services, Whittier elementary, loyal heights community center, corner of 28th and 80th essentially.",254,,
1294,0.97,9021.879,9033.858,"So roughly 8,000 square foot piece of property zoned Lr2 right on the 18 Express line and the number 40.",254,,
1295,0.97,9033.858,9035.326,So it's just a fabulous location.,254,,
1296,0.97,9038.896,9051.809,We did come to you last year and you approved the transfer of the property from city light to Oh.,254,,
1297,0.97,9051.809,9060.951,Through the competitive Rfp project process we selected habitat for humanity as our preferred developer and they now--they're ready to start construction.,254,,
1298,0.97,9063.287,9082.907,"So I should say at that time a year ago you approved the transfer of two pieces of property, one at Finny ridge as well and we're still working with our preferred developer on that site, Homestead community land trust, to get their plans approved and be ready to move forward in construction with that project.",254,,
1299,0.97,9082.907,9091.115,"It's a slightly more complex transaction, but we're ready for this property to be transferred.",254,,
1300,0.97,9095.352,9102.693,"The legislation, as Traci mentioned, authorizes the bulk of the property to be transferred from Oh to habitat.",254,,
1301,0.97,9104.662,9117.808,There is a small one foot piece on the back that is for an alley dedication that just needs a jurisdictional transfer to Sdot.,254,,
1302,0.97,9117.808,9130.621,"In exchange for this No-Cost transfer, habitat for humanity will be building seven Three- bedroom Townhomes that will be sold to households with incomes at or below 80% for affordable prices.",254,,
1303,0.97,9131.555,9136.127,"And that affordable price is going to be around $175,000.",254,,
1304,0.97,9136.127,9146.904,"So anyone who has been shopping these days knows that that is very, very affordable relative to market, but most importantly, affordable to our target income market.",254,,
1305,0.97,9150.608,9174.899,They originally had proposed eight Townhomes and they are really exceptional in their sort of good neighbor work and because of the trees to the South side of that property they determined they could build seven without disrupting the root zones of those trees and I remember then Council member Bagshaw asking a question a year ago at this same conversation about the trees.,254,,
1306,0.97,9174.899,9178.435,"So if she's out there listening, we're saving the trees.",254,,
1307,0.97,9178.435,9180.704,All right.,254,,
1308,0.97,9182.806,9215.105,"So because of the 50-year affordable Covenant that Oh will record, we know that these homes being built at all subsequent RESALES within that 50-year period will also be sold to income eligible buyers for affordable prices, but because of habitat's mission, they utilize a 99 year renewable Inheritable ground lease much like Homestead community land trust.",254,,
1309,0.97,9215.105,9227.251,"The homes will be permanently Fourable, affordable forever in Northwest Seattle to families and I think that's the end of my presentation.",254,,
1310,0.97,9227.251,9227.551,Any questions?,254,,
1311,0.97,9228.485,9229.453,Thank you very much.,255,,
1312,0.97,9229.453,9234.959,Before we move on I want to say thank you as well to Daniel Murillo.,255,,
1313,0.97,9234.959,9239.163,"I see you on here as well from our office of housing, excited to have you.",255,,
1314,0.97,9239.163,9245.769,I know that you are the policy and equitable development manager which is a very cool title.,255,,
1315,0.97,9245.769,9247.671,Anything else to add before we take Council member comments?,255,,
1316,0.97,9249.206,9251.775,"No, I do not.",256,,
1317,0.97,9251.775,9252.243,"Thank you, Erika.",256,,
1318,0.97,9252.243,9259.883,This is a really good exciting opportunity to provide some permanent Affordability in the high opportunity area.,256,,
1319,0.97,9259.883,9260.884,So thank you.,256,,
1320,0.97,9260.884,9261.218,Excellent.,257,,
1321,0.97,9261.218,9261.518,Wonderful.,257,,
1322,0.97,9261.518,9268.592,"Speaking of loving trees and being a strong advocate for trees, Dan Strauss, council member Strauss.",257,,
1323,0.97,9268.592,9269.994,Would you liking to ahead?,257,,
1324,0.97,9269.994,9271.562,I saw your hand up.,257,,
1325,0.97,9271.562,9271.996,Yeah.,258,,
1326,0.97,9271.996,9275.432,"Ãšthank you very much, chairman Mosqueda.",258,,
1327,0.97,9275.432,9278.002,"Erika, I heard you say, but it went very quickly.",258,,
1328,0.97,9278.002,9288.245,What is the price point of these units and you mentioned that there's a 50-year Covenant for Affordability.,258,,
1329,0.97,9288.245,9296.82,"Can you share with me again those details how do we keep these affordable, what will those rates be and who is going to benefit?",258,,
1330,0.97,9296.82,9298.789,"Absolutely, yes.",259,,
1331,0.97,9298.789,9310.367,"The target price point is $175,000 and that is made affordable by the office of housing's investment with some of habitat for humanity's direct investment.",259,,
1332,0.97,9310.367,9316.607,So the cost of each of the homes is about 220.,259,,
1333,0.97,9316.607,9324.581,"Cost to build is about 280, excuse me, but they'll be sold for $175,000.",259,,
1334,0.97,9324.581,9331.522,"Of course, they're able to come in at that low cost due to a lot of donated materials and donated labor.",259,,
1335,0.97,9331.522,9334.058,That's the beauty of habitat for humanity's model.,259,,
1336,0.97,9335.893,9342.166,The Covenant--I'll speak to actually the ground laying.,259,,
1337,0.97,9342.166,9343.967,They both actually align.,259,,
1338,0.97,9343.967,9345.869,Oh's Covenant is 50 years.,259,,
1339,0.97,9345.869,9354.344,The ground lease from habitat for humanity is 99 years renewable and Inheritable.,259,,
1340,0.97,9354.344,9356.213,So it is essentially in Perpetuity.,259,,
1341,0.97,9356.213,9375.232,"Habitat for humanity will continue to own the land and lease the land to the homeowners on which their homes sit and so in exchange essentially for this good deal, for the first homebuyers, they agree to when or if they sell their home to do so at an affordable price to the next buyer.",259,,
1342,0.97,9375.232,9385.242,They have a resale formula which balances the equity that a home seller would get upon leaving with the Affordability for the next household.,259,,
1343,0.97,9386.844,9389.88,That's really excellent to hear.,260,,
1344,0.97,9389.88,9394.385,It allows for that generational wealth to be built and for Affordability to continue to exist.,260,,
1345,0.97,9394.385,9399.223,Can you share with me is there an area median income requirement to purchase these?,260,,
1346,0.97,9399.223,9404.495,How do we determine who is eligible to purchase these homes?,260,,
1347,0.97,9404.495,9404.762,Yeah.,261,,
1348,0.97,9404.762,9405.129,Great question.,261,,
1349,0.97,9405.129,9405.329,Yes.,261,,
1350,0.97,9405.329,9410.834,To be eligible you have to have an income at or below 80% of area median income.,261,,
1351,0.97,9410.834,9419.81,Has habitat for humanity has been successful at serving much lower.,261,,
1352,0.97,9419.81,9434.024,I think their average income served is about 65% of area median income and that will be case for all subsequent homebuyers over that 99 plus 99 plus 99 year period.,261,,
1353,0.97,9434.024,9434.591,Wonderful.,262,,
1354,0.97,9434.591,9434.892,Thank you.,262,,
1355,0.97,9434.892,9438.629,"Chair, if I may just make some general comments to this.",262,,
1356,0.97,9438.629,9439.062,"Great, thank you.",262,,
1357,0.97,9439.062,9441.031,I see you nodding your head.,262,,
1358,0.97,9441.031,9450.374,This location is a place I walked past on my way home from Whitman middle school so many years ago.,262,,
1359,0.97,9450.374,9455.913,"When my parents, two social workers, purchased their home in Ballard, homes were usually about $100,000 in that area.",262,,
1360,0.97,9455.913,9458.849,Ballard was not a desirable place to live necessarily.,262,,
1361,0.97,9458.849,9468.358,"It was for us that lived there, maybe not for other parts of the city if you might remember some of the almost live skits kind of poking fun at Ballard.",262,,
1362,0.97,9468.358,9472.095,"If you're lucky enough to be from Ballard, you're lucky enough.",262,,
1363,0.97,9472.095,9473.764,That was the saying back then.,262,,
1364,0.97,9473.764,9489.913,"Nearby there's some really great open spaces and you'd be surprised that as recently as the 1970s some of the houses along sunset Hill park that's not too far away were going for $30,000.",262,,
1365,0.97,9489.913,9496.32,So I paint that picture because the Economics of Ballard have changed so much.,262,,
1366,0.97,9496.32,9503.527,"Not only has it become a more desirable place to live that, has also increased the cost of a house.",262,,
1367,0.97,9503.527,9530.32,"The reason I'm still a Renter today is because House prices are out of reach for me and so, you know, I go back to the price of a house was $100,000, you know, not so long ago just in the 1980s and with that you could have many different lines of work and be able to achieve the American dream of owning your own home.",262,,
1368,0.97,9530.32,9549.172,"Today home costs, there's a home that's not too far away on 75th and 28th that is I think 600 square feet and it's going for $425,000 and it needs to be--it will need a lot of love to be fixed up.",262,,
1369,0.97,9549.172,9557.381,So I just want to flag that this is such a great opportunity to create a Pathway to homeownership.,262,,
1370,0.97,9557.381,9561.818,I know there have been past proposals to create green space and a park there.,262,,
1371,0.97,9561.818,9598.422,"I flagged there is a lot of green space nearby not only with golden gardens park which is about a half mile, quarter mile away, sunset Hill Park, a quarter mile away, Royal heights elementary school a couple blocks away and when I walked past there all those years ago from Whitman middle school, there were some really amazing Cherry trees there on that property and it is sad to see that those Cherry trees were removed a number of years ago.",262,,
1372,0.97,9598.422,9604.094,"Also in that same breath, thank you for preserving the adjacent trees that really do provide an economic value.",262,,
1373,0.97,9604.094,9616.506,I think that this proposal alone demonstrates the challenge at times regarding the preservation of trees.,262,,
1374,0.97,9616.506,9619.142,We lost one unit here.,262,,
1375,0.97,9619.142,9619.71,You proposed eight units.,262,,
1376,0.97,9619.71,9626.35,We now have seven and it also demonstrates that the trees have an economic value.,262,,
1377,0.97,9626.35,9627.517,So overall huge thanks.,262,,
1378,0.97,9627.517,9628.852,This is great.,262,,
1379,0.97,9628.852,9637.594,It creates a Pathway to homeownership and generational wealth for families that moved into this neighborhood so many years ago that might be priced out today.,262,,
1380,0.97,9637.594,9640.764,So just lots of thanks.,262,,
1381,0.97,9642.499,9645.202,"Thank you, council member Strauss.",263,,
1382,0.97,9645.202,9649.973,"I just want to add or maybe remind, thank you all because these are levy funds.",263,,
1383,0.97,9649.973,9657.314,So all of you and all of us voters are what's making this possible.,263,,
1384,0.97,9659.216,9659.75,Good point.,264,,
1385,0.97,9659.75,9666.857,"Council member Lewis, you have another appointment soon, if you have anything else to add, happy to get you in.",264,,
1386,0.97,9666.857,9671.628,"Thank you so much, Madam chair.",265,,
1387,0.97,9671.628,9701.691,"First I want to begin my remarks by expressing it's another Ballard native, my fondness for those almost live sketches about Ballard, I was also a very reluctant Accordian lesson student, not really, but if anyone wants to go and get a good idea of what the Ballard is like, go watch those almost live sketches with the young bill Nye, but talking about the matter at hand, I have a couple of questions.",265,,
1388,0.97,9701.691,9704.561,I think I'll ask them all now in the interest of efficiency.,265,,
1389,0.97,9707.964,9716.139,The first one is I appreciate the art that's been part of the presentation on seeing how these units are going to come together.,265,,
1390,0.97,9716.139,9746.269,I wonder if you might be able to explain a little bit about the materials and the mode of construction and whether that has been a significant cost saving and how something like that could be Replicated or maybe Incentivized in a Market- based way to extend the Affordability into other sort of Townhouse development throughout the city.,265,,
1391,0.97,9746.269,9750.774,That would be the first question.,265,,
1392,0.97,9750.774,9832.789,"The second question would be based on the lease and sort of Covenant method of transferring the properties to allow folks to build Intergenerational wealth, but also preserve long term Affordability, what some tactics might be on are a strategy to extend and Incentivize those kind of arrangements again in a marketplace why particularly in an area were the city to expand housing options in more of the city for development that allows multiple families to live in plots like this in ways we can focus on not only doing it in these sort of unique coalition building projects where we bring a lot of Stakeholders together to build seven units on city-owned property with a nonprofit developer, but ways we can provide incentives so that can be Replicated by folks that build this kind of missing middle housing if there were city regulations permitting more of it, but doing it in a way where it was expressing this kind or stressing this kind of equitable arrangement of transfer and ongoing support for low income families.",265,,
1393,0.97,9842.899,9843.233,Yeah.,266,,
1394,0.97,9843.233,9848.305,Thank now you for those questions.,266,,
1395,0.97,9848.305,9862.919,"Firstly the cost savings that habitat employs, they are stick built.",266,,
1396,0.97,9862.919,9868.325,In terms of replication habitat is sort of a powerhouse both in Philanthropy and in mobilizing volunteers.,266,,
1397,0.97,9868.325,9880.704,I'm not sure I can really speak to potentially how Replicatable those cost savings might be for other types of developers.,266,,
1398,0.97,9880.704,9894.818,"To your second question, the office of housing has a tremendous history of investing in permanently affordable homeownership, Firstly through Homestead community land trust.",266,,
1399,0.97,9894.818,9934.157,"They have hundreds of units throughout the city, maybe 300 in the county, I'm sorry, not in addition to, 300 total including units in King County, and this type of arrangement, this sort of equity sharing arrangement, if you will, that homeowners get Affordability in exchange for passing on Affordability is a national approach usually utilized by organizations called community land trusts, but for Additionally habitat for humanity affiliates across the country are looking at this as well.",266,,
1400,0.97,9934.157,9949.039,I personally think it's a really great way for the city to invest in homeownership because it is a growing stock of permanently affordable homes for people in our community who will always need them.,266,,
1401,0.97,9950.707,9952.876,So I hope that answered your questions.,266,,
1402,0.97,9952.876,9956.079,I might have lost track of the second part of the second question.,266,,
1403,0.97,9956.079,9957.414,I tried to scribble them down.,266,,
1404,0.97,9957.414,9961.084,Let me know if I missed the mark.,266,,
1405,0.97,9961.084,9961.318,No.,267,,
1406,0.97,9961.318,9961.985,That was perfect.,267,,
1407,0.97,9961.985,9964.721,Thank you so much.,267,,
1408,0.97,9967.791,9998.855,"I think the bottom line when it comes to the private market being interested in this kind of model, the private market when it comes to homeownership, they're into building it, selling it and leaving and the benefit of habitat and Homestead is that they're in it to build and to stay and be involved helping to insure the housing stayed affordable over the long haul and they, in fact, have a legal responsibility through the covenants, et cetera, to make sure that happens.",268,,
1409,0.97,9998.855,10005.862,They're a mission driven organization that's in it for that long haul outcome and the private market really is not oriented that way generally speaking.,268,,
1410,0.97,10005.862,10008.798,"They're in to build, sell and be gone.",268,,
1411,0.97,10008.798,10024.013,"So that's the benefit of having these Nonprofits who care about Affordability for people, not just for the first homeowner, but all the others that will come after because it's inevitable you'll have a turnover in those homeownership Nits.",268,,
1412,0.97,10024.013,10035.024,"That tends to be the nature of the homeownership, just add that on to why the market may not be quite Incentivized or interested in this kind of model.",268,,
1413,0.97,10035.024,10035.725,Excellent.,269,,
1414,0.97,10035.725,10037.16,Any additional questions?,269,,
1415,0.97,10037.16,10037.961,Not seeing any hands.,269,,
1416,0.97,10037.961,10049.205,"I will just make one more note of appreciation for the length in which it has taken us to get here, the time frame.",269,,
1417,0.97,10049.205,10063.753,"It's hard not being able to see how votes that you take immediately translate into action, but it is important for us to remember all of the work it took to get to this point.",269,,
1418,0.97,10063.753,10090.013,"Again, the conversation started with a recognition that in 2018 in partnership with our friends at the state Legislature we passed legislation to update the state's disposition policies to put into place newly granted state authorization to make sure we were Prioritizing affordable housing for surplus lands and to Embed an equitable development lands into that process.",269,,
1419,0.97,10090.013,10108.398,"We know as well a small piece of legislation we passed previously years ago enabled the city and city Utility-Owned property to be transferred at no cost for the creation of affordable housing and as we know, the price of land continues to go up.",269,,
1420,0.97,10108.398,10128.118,So what's really important here is that in the last year we authorized the first No-Cost transfer to the office of housing for affordable homeownership in loyal heights following that legislation and this piece of legislation that follows on top of that is enabling our Department to transfer the site to actually create a permanent affordable housing on site.,269,,
1421,0.97,10128.118,10130.52,"This is a really, really exciting opportunity.",269,,
1422,0.97,10130.52,10143.199,I wanted to highlight that because it's years of work and also partnership with the state Legislature.,269,,
1423,0.97,10145.301,10159.749,Three years ago I was riding around with Tony who many of you know and he was pointing out various places where we in the city invested prior in first time homeownership opportunities.,269,,
1424,0.97,10159.749,10160.783,I was like this is so exciting.,269,,
1425,0.97,10160.783,10165.488,"Show me the first one and he said frankly, it's so slow to pull them Online.",269,,
1426,0.97,10165.488,10167.223,We need so much more of this.,269,,
1427,0.97,10167.223,10186.376,Just yesterday I was talking to him about this legislation and he was emphasizing the need for us to create homeownership opportunities for people up to 80% AMI so that there's a pipeline to get people out of the lowest income housing requires them to be able to move on to first time homeownership opportunities like this.,269,,
1428,0.97,10186.376,10198.388,"This, frankly, is a key tool in addressing generational poverty as well to end cycles so that people actually have equity that they can fall back on, equity in many uses of that term.",269,,
1429,0.97,10198.388,10205.128,"With that in mind I don't see any other comments, let's go ahead and move passage of the bill.",269,,
1430,0.97,10205.128,10209.365,I move the committee recommends passage of Council bill 119890.,269,,
1431,0.97,10209.365,10210.633,Is there a second?,269,,

1434,0.97,10216.005,10217.54,Are there additional further comments?,271,,
