121,0.97,651.183,657.89,A capital gains tax proposal has passed the floor of the Washington State Senate.,28,,

124,0.97,669.301,673.105,"So, just to provide an overview of those.",28,,

127,0.97,703.002,706.639,"So, that change was made.",28,,
128,0.97,706.639,710.943,I think there is anticipation that it may wind up coming up for a public vote.,28,,
129,0.97,710.943,714.547,At some point later this year.,28,,
130,0.97,714.547,723.255,"In addition to that change, there were some smaller changes made in terms of the direction of the proceeds.",28,,
131,0.97,723.255,737.269,The first $350 million in revenue from the capital gains tax is still directed to the education legacy trust fund with the intention of that funding going towards early learning and Childcare.,28,,
132,0.97,737.269,748.28,"After that, the bill was amended to direct the next $100 million after that first $350 million to the general fund.",28,,
133,0.97,748.28,755.788,"Then, the remainder of the balance of any revenues from the capital gains tax would still go to a new taxpayer relief account.",28,,
134,0.97,755.788,770.202,"With the attention of providing some relief on more Regressive revenue sources, or funding programs that provide relief for lower income households, such as the working families tax credit.",28,,
135,0.97,770.202,784.016,"Finally, there were some Tweaks made to the small business exemption that broadened the eligibility from the threshold from $6 million for small business entities.",28,,
136,0.97,784.016,785.885,That goes to $10 million.,28,,
137,0.97,785.885,791.991,"Removing the number of employees, the cap on the number of employees or a small business.",28,,
138,0.97,791.991,793.626,That was previously set at 50.,28,,
139,0.97,793.626,813.512,"Now, small businesses can qualify as long as they are under $10 million in gross income and they have been owned and controlled by a member of the family for at least five of the last eight years.",28,,
140,0.97,813.512,821.821,"So, that exemption was broadened a little bit more.",28,,
141,0.97,821.821,824.056,"Otherwise, the bill remains similar to what was passed out of committee.",28,,
142,0.97,824.056,830.963,"7% tax over 250,000 per year in capital games with exemptions for retirements, real estate, and a handful of agricultural properties.",28,,
143,0.97,830.963,840.539,"So, this again, extremely, extremely exciting and positive news coming out of the state Senate.",28,,
144,0.97,840.539,848.847,I think all of our members of our Seattle delegation deserve a lot of credit and Plaudits for their work to help get us to this point.,28,,
145,0.97,848.847,852.484,Along with Senator Robinson from Everett.,28,,
146,0.97,852.484,855.955,He really shepherded this prayer--proposal.,28,,

150,0.97,867.8,870.803,"With that, I will pause for any questions.",28,,
151,0.97,870.803,878.11,"Colleagues, any questions or comments for O'Quinn?",29,,
152,0.97,878.11,879.311,I'm scanning here.,29,,
153,0.97,879.311,884.016,Just to make sure nobody has raised their hands.,29,,
154,0.97,884.016,886.252,I don't see any hands up so let's keep going.,29,,

205,0.97,1182.614,1186.618,The debate began on Saturday evening and went well into the evening.,40,,
206,0.97,1186.618,1190.322,"Then, continued on to Sunday.",40,,
207,0.97,1190.322,1199.231,"So, it was quite a grueling floor debate.",40,,
208,0.97,1199.231,1206.338,There were some bad amendments that would have eliminated the part of the bill that closes the Seattle loophole that applies to term leases.,40,,
209,0.97,1206.338,1213.645,Those were managed to be defeated so the bill will in fact close our loophole as it is right now.,40,,
210,0.97,1213.645,1219.952,"So, it's really quite a momentous passage in the House yesterday.",40,,

219,0.97,1269.901,1286.685,"I just want to underscore how exciting it is that the law that we have had to protect tenants here in Seattle, the just cause law that has been in place since the late 1980s, is now a tenant right afforded to tenants throughout the state of Washington.",42,,
220,0.97,1286.685,1287.619,"It is very, very important.",42,,
221,0.97,1287.619,1294.092,I really am so proud that representative Macri is the champion for this bill.,42,,
222,0.97,1294.092,1301.633,"Also, that she fought so hard for Seattle, where as we've had just cause Eviction for a very, very long time.",42,,
223,0.97,1301.633,1308.14,There is actually loophole as Robin mentioned for tenants at the end of their lease agreement.,42,,
224,0.97,1308.14,1318.65,"Tenants at the end of the lease agreement could have performed all of the obligations under their lease agreement perfectly, and they can still be given a No-Cost notice at the end of the term.",42,,
225,0.97,1318.65,1337.369,"Representative Macri not only saw the need to fight for the just cause right, broadly for residents of Washington state, but she didn't forget her constituents here in Seattle who really need this loophole closed.",42,,
226,0.97,1337.369,1342.441,Because of the large number of tenants who are displaced at the end of their lease term.,42,,
227,0.97,1342.441,1350.982,"So, really, really proud of that work and want to also think Oir in particular, Robin, for keeping me up to speed on it.",42,,
228,0.97,1350.982,1354.453,Keeping the need for the closure of the loophole front and center.,42,,
229,0.97,1354.453,1362.16,Just really appreciate her updating me over the weekend and giving the little things I could do to help along the way.,42,,
230,0.97,1362.16,1364.796,Just along the edges a little bit.,42,,
231,0.97,1364.796,1376.575,"One question, Robin, thank you for letting us all know that the loophole closure language survived despite the amendments to try to remove it.",42,,
232,0.97,1376.575,1382.414,I did lose track of when the Preemption amendment came up.,42,,
233,0.97,1382.414,1384.983,I trust that also failed?,42,,
234,0.97,1384.983,1389.721,"Yes, I believe it did.",43,,
235,0.97,1389.721,1393.225,There were a couple of amendments to the bill that I haven't had a chance to analyze yet.,43,,
236,0.97,1393.225,1403.135,"I will certainly take a look at those, representative Macri said they did have to take a couple of amendments that they would have preferred not to, but it was what they needed to do to move the bill.",43,,
237,0.97,1403.135,1404.903,So.,43,,
238,0.97,1404.903,1411.51,"Councilmember Herbold, I should also say thank you to you.",44,,
239,0.97,1411.51,1419.351,"I apologize for not saying so, but it was wonderful to have you help out with doing some outreach to legislators over the weekend, so thank you for that.",44,,
240,0.97,1419.351,1425.724,Are there any more questions on housing?,45,,

242,0.97,1428.76,1430.429,"Go ahead, Councilmember Juarez.",47,,
243,0.97,1430.429,1431.63,Thank you.,48,,

248,0.97,1449.281,1452.751,That has proved to be quite a controversy bill.,49,,
249,0.97,1452.751,1461.893,We have been basically supporting it in Seattle.,49,,
250,0.97,1461.893,1463.094,I'm certainly keeping my eye on it.,49,,
251,0.97,1463.094,1466.364,It did move out of the house.,49,,
252,0.97,1466.364,1470.402,"So, it is moving along.",49,,
253,0.97,1470.402,1473.672,"But, I do understand that negotiations are ongoing on that bill.",49,,
254,0.97,1473.672,1478.71,I'll make sure to keep the Council updated on what is happening there.,49,,
255,0.97,1478.71,1479.978,Thank you for that.,50,,
256,0.97,1479.978,1485.217,Any other questions in the area of housing?,50,,
257,0.97,1485.217,1487.285,I'm not seeing any other hands raised.,50,,

503,0.97,2853.884,2873.203,"Now, I raise this just to highlight that we are seeing examples in other jurisdictions, and continue to, of a reliance on the new information from the Biden administration regarding FEMA reimbursement that this Council and the city continues to explore as something we should be doing.",89,,
504,0.97,2873.203,2892.089,"I personally believe we should be expanding the scope of the FEMA reimbursements we are already seeking, not to suggest we aren't seeking it, we know that for her tiny House villages and a lot of other things, the city has been aggressively seeking FEMA reimbursement.",89,,
505,0.97,2892.089,2905.636,It is possible that we could expand the scope of what we are seeking . I want to just lift up some of the comments director noble made last week and Councilmember Mosqueda's committee.,89,,

507,0.97,2915.545,2936.867,"That essentially the cracks of director noble's testimony is that is certainly possible if we follow the guidelines expressed and itemized in director noble's February 23rd Email to this Council, which has been extensively discussed in public.",89,,

513,0.97,2965.796,2973.303,"And making sure that the programming is targeted to people that are at high risk of exposure to Covid, acknowledging that there may be some sheltering programs that will be FEMA Reimbursable.",89,,
514,0.97,2973.303,2987.317,"But that there certainly can be some, if designed correctly, to target specifically folks at high risk of Covid exposure and at high risk of severe complications due to Covid.",89,,
515,0.97,2987.317,3021.451,"Among other conditions that were highlighted in that Email, given that it was confirmed by director noble that a policy so designed could be pursued, at least technically, by the administration to benefit from the Biden administration's 100% FEMA reimbursement . above and beyond what we are already pursuing and applying for, I'll be working this week with colleagues and Stakeholders to bring such proposals forward for the consideration of the Council, and then ultimately for the consideration of the executive.",89,,

801,0.97,4981.876,4997.425,"Then, with the resolution, if there is interest by the Council president and the council as a whole, I would love to see that pass on May 15th as a resolution.",117,,

805,0.97,5015.944,5022.851,With the anticipated passage of the actual ordinance at our first meeting in April.,117,,
806,0.97,5022.851,5027.122,That's I believe the Timeline.,117,,
807,0.97,5027.122,5037.265,I will double check with central staff and I will refer back to the memo as well to update my notes that that is my anticipated Timeframe.,117,,
808,0.97,5037.265,5040.869,To have two meetings to discuss the actual ordinance before it comes to full council.,117,,
809,0.97,5040.869,5041.736,Okay.,118,,
810,0.97,5041.736,5059.187,"On the resolution, I would like to ask that that be introduced and placed on the introduction and referral calendar for the 15th, but I would like us to hold action until after the 15th.",118,,

815,0.97,5107.735,5127.021,"So, I think there may be information in that particular memo that may, again, be informative to individual Councilmembers as they are evaluating both language they might have, might want included in the resolution, but may not have enough time to get into it in order for you to comply with the introduction and referral calendar.",118,,
816,0.97,5127.021,5127.422,Referral process.,118,,
817,0.97,5127.422,5145.54,"Or, help to inform Councilmembers in identifying priorities that they might want to fly for Council central staff for purposes of including in the ordinance, the legislation, that you are going to shepherd through your Committee.",118,,

819,0.97,5152.28,5161.189,"So, I just want to slow us down a little bit to allow us an opportunity to get that information.",118,,
820,0.97,5161.189,5166.895,"Not all of us are the chair of the budget committee, so that means we have a little bit more of a steeper learning curve than you do.",118,,
821,0.97,5166.895,5169.397,In terms of getting up to speed on some of these issues.,118,,
822,0.97,5169.397,5176.004,"So, if we could have just a little bit more space to do some of that due diligence, I think that would be helpful.",118,,
823,0.97,5176.004,5183.711,"Both to the full counselor, but also to me personally as I'm looking to catch up on these issues as well.",118,,

832,0.97,5227.221,5235.33,"We will have sort of both going at the same time, but we will have a much longer Timeframe for the actual ordinance.",119,,
833,0.97,5235.33,5249.744,"But, we would still appreciate your sense of urgency as it sounds like we want to be quick in getting those dollars out, and the Council President, your suggestion still allows us that sense of urgency.",119,,

939,0.97,5807.001,5817.645,"We are seeing in some cities like Columbus, Ohio, courts essentially authorizing mass Evictions.",130,,
940,0.97,5817.645,5821.549,It is essential that Mayor Durkan and Governor Inslee immediately extend the Eviction moratorium through the end of 2021.,130,,
941,0.97,5821.549,5825.619,The Covid health emergency is far from over.,130,,
942,0.97,5825.619,5831.859,"Now, there are predictions that there could be future surges and many people are still out of work.",130,,
943,0.97,5831.859,5836.03,We are now a terrifying 23 days away from the end of the moratorium if it is not extended.,130,,
944,0.97,5836.03,5847.341,Last week I shared with Councilmembers something demanding that Mayor Durkan and Governor Inslee extend the moratorium to the end of 2021.,130,,

950,0.97,5875.169,5883.711,"In Seattle, there are legal differences against Eviction, but that is simply not enough because most Renters need legal support to be able to use the legal defenses to protect themselves and their families.",130,,
951,0.97,5883.711,5899.326,Renters need the right to legal representation . The housing justice project which as you know is a project of the King County bar Association has determined that even during the pandemic landlords have sought more than 300 Evictions in Seattle.,130,,
952,0.97,5899.326,5905.432,"To allow people to face Eviction, a potential death sentence in this pandemic, without legal Council is simply appalling.",130,,
953,0.97,5905.432,5911.739,"The housing justice project reported to the committee that prior to the pandemic, landlords in Seattle filed about 1200 Eviction claims per year.",130,,
954,0.97,5911.739,5915.442,This is an Undercount according to the housing justice project staff.,130,,
955,0.97,5915.442,5922.049,They say many landlords get the tenant to move out before any court is filed.,130,,
956,0.97,5922.049,5926.62,That doesn't get captured in the data.,130,,
957,0.97,5926.62,5930.224,"Overwhelmingly, the landlords filing for Eviction of the big corporate landlords.",130,,
958,0.97,5930.224,5941.168,The housing justice project found that seven of the 10 Evicting--top 10 Evicting landlords in 2019 were major regional and national corporate landlords with the number one Evicting landlords being Goodman real estate.,130,,

960,0.97,5948.075,5953.614,Imagine being a tenant facing Eviction be Haps because you lost your job or had a medical emergency.,130,,
961,0.97,5953.614,5959.486,Having to go to court alone and facing a high-priced lawyer paid by a corporate landlord.,130,,
962,0.97,5959.486,5964.358,It is no wonder that so many of the tenants give up long before that.,130,,
963,0.97,5964.358,5971.865,"According to the ACLU, 90% of landlords going to Eviction court with an attorney, while only 10% of tenants have an attorney.",130,,
964,0.97,5971.865,5975.703,Those right to Council legislation will give tenants a fighting chance against landlords.,130,,
965,0.97,5975.703,5983.21,"The vast majority of Eviction filing Pre-Pandemic were for nonpayment of rent, and as you may recall from the 2018 report, losing homes.",130,,
966,0.97,5983.21,5987.081,The majority of these Eviction claims filed by landlords were for one month rent or less.,130,,
967,0.97,5987.081,5994.922,"The losing home report reveals that the Renters who are women and people of color, especially African-American, are more likely to face Eviction.",130,,
968,0.97,5994.922,6002.129,"In fact, the staff presented new data on the racist nature of our Eviction system.",130,,
969,0.97,6002.129,6015.943,"In 2019, they found while black people constituted a .3% of Siena's population, they accounted for fully 28% of all tenants served with Eviction papers.",130,,

972,0.97,6025.252,6031.358,That's why I urge all Councilmember to publicly support and vote for our right to Council legislation without loopholes when it comes before us next Monday.,130,,
973,0.97,6031.358,6035.429,Some suggest that tenant access to counsel should be subject to means testing.,130,,
974,0.97,6035.429,6045.439,That is often put forward as something to supposedly make those--make sure those that are financially well off don't skim off public services and public assistance.,130,,
975,0.97,6045.439,6047.074,We've been hearing this for decades.,130,,
976,0.97,6047.074,6054.081,"Means testing is actually done, if you look at the data, is presenting those who need the services and are eligible for them from Accessing it.",130,,
977,0.97,6054.081,6056.583,Means testing is what the corporate landlords want.,130,,
978,0.97,6056.583,6062.456,Not what Renter or tenant advocate want and right to counsel.,130,,
979,0.97,6062.456,6066.894,It means testing would completely undermine the point of having guaranteed right to counsel.,130,,
980,0.97,6066.894,6082.376,"We heard last Thursday from the managing attorney for housing justice project who described how in circumstances where there was means testing, attorneys would end up having to spend a considerable amount of time just to ascertain whether their client was eligible for services or not.",130,,
981,0.97,6082.376,6087.014,Instead of actually representing them.,130,,
982,0.97,6087.014,6089.75,How clients often did not have the paperwork to prove their financial situation.,130,,

984,0.97,6095.722,6098.826,Imagine being an immigrant with language barriers.,130,,
985,0.97,6098.826,6101.628,You wouldn't be able to prove your financial availability.,130,,
986,0.97,6101.628,6107.935,The means testing would revoke your eligibility for Eviction.,130,,
987,0.97,6107.935,6121.148,"He also noted that in San Francisco where the right to counsel applies to all, with no means testing all kinds, they found that 94% of tenants getting legal aid were of low to moderate income, not rich people.",130,,
988,0.97,6121.148,6126.019,"Most importantly, no one subjects themselves to the risk of Eviction if they can pay.",130,,
989,0.97,6126.019,6133.56,They will move heaven and earth Topay their rent and avoid Eviction for when they are in Eviction overwhelmingly having come out of options.,130,,
990,0.97,6133.56,6136.53,Like being out of options entirely.,130,,
991,0.97,6136.53,6142.469,"Being faced with possible Eviction, therefore there should be no barrier to Accessing the right to counsel.",130,,
992,0.97,6142.469,6157.484,"Finally, we hold on Thursday, about a study in Baltimore that shows that every dollar invested in providing tenants with legal aid saved the city and state about seven dollars in cost of Eviction.",130,,

994,0.97,6161.788,6172.366,"Similar to even Los Angeles, Boston, and elsewhere have shown demonstrably that giving tenants legal assistance without any kind of values reduces the number of Evictions and saves governments money.",130,,

999,0.97,6207.1,6209.803,Some are saying that we should exclude tenants or rent from small landlords.,130,,
1000,0.97,6209.803,6217.844,I would personally think that is an absurd argument but I also think it's a dangerous move that will only lead to more litigation and evasion by the corporate landlords.,130,,
1001,0.97,6217.844,6222.316,As they try to sneak into the loophole.,130,,
1002,0.97,6222.316,6225.953,"First of all, just as looking at the data, small landlords are not the major problem here.",130,,
1003,0.97,6225.953,6247.074,"Even if a small landlord was involved in Eviction, I believe the tenant deserves the same right of representation . In fact, my office has received supportive messages from a number of small landlords who recognize we do need stronger tenants rights and they support these tenants rights.",130,,
1004,0.97,6247.074,6251.778,Also it is discriminatory to argue that some tenants deserve legal representation while others don't simply because of happenstance of who they landlord is.,130,,
1005,0.97,6251.778,6261.989,I'll also note that corporate landlords often incorporate individual buildings separately for tax purposes and creating a report for small landlords would only encourage more evasive Maneuverings by corporate landlords.,130,,
1006,0.97,6261.989,6274.701,To escape accountability and tie up the whole Eviction process in litigation or whether a tenant has or did not have the right to legal counsel.,130,,
