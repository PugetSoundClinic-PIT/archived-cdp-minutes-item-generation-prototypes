188,0.97,1022.755,1033.866,It is important to know the justice system and our society that leads to youth of color having less access to these Diagnoses and Evidence-Based intervention and to more interactions with law enforcement.,58,,
189,0.97,1033.866,1040.839,There are developmental changes to adolescent brains that affect their ability to understand what it means to waive their rights.,58,,

199,0.97,1089.888,1101.066,I'm a little bias in my support of this ordinance because of the loss of my son by the hands of law enforcement and also by the desire to prevent another family from suffering the pain that I feel.,60,,
200,0.97,1101.066,1103.035,When it absolutely could have been avoided.,60,,
201,0.97,1103.035,1105.204,There are laws in place to protect our children.,60,,
202,0.97,1105.204,1116.915,"One problem with the law is knowledge and the protections for the lack of said rights or knowledge of, our youth need to have the ordinance adopted and promoted.",60,,
203,0.97,1116.915,1123.755,It would be ineffective if the youth have rights if they're unaware of.,60,,
204,0.97,1123.755,1126.725,I'm honored to have this ordinance named in remembrance of my son.,60,,
205,0.97,1126.725,1132.664,He was a beautiful soul who always want to help the less fortunate protect the weak and defend the innocent.,60,,

208,0.97,1144.042,1145.544,Thank you.,60,,
209,0.97,1145.544,1149.615,Thank you for calling in today.,61,,

216,0.97,1186.118,1198.53,It is vital that our youth have the right to legal Council before waiving any rights to speak to a public defender before police officers can pressure our youth into giving up their constitutional rights.,62,,
217,0.97,1198.53,1212.377,"I know for myself, I would not have known the meaning and risk associated with waiving my constitutional rights as a youth and would feel intimidated and scared while speaking with a police officer.",62,,
218,0.97,1212.377,1217.182,This step would insure our youth of color can make informed decisions while interacting with police and law enforcement.,62,,
219,0.97,1217.182,1225.857,"We know that the school to prison pipeline is disproportionately Impacting black, indigenous, and Brown youth.",62,,
220,0.97,1225.857,1232.831,"It's a step to ensure less youth enter the criminal injustice system, or worse, die at the hands of police.",62,,
221,0.97,1232.831,1243.875,"I call upon you, Councilmembers, to vote to pass the Michance Dunlap Gittens youth right ordinance.",62,,

229,0.97,1273.739,1284.75,Young people being Interrogated by police officers are uniquely vulnerable and must be given sound legal advice when deciding to waive their rights.,64,,
230,0.97,1284.75,1290.088,Juveniles often don't understand their constitutional rights or the consequences of waiving those rights.,64,,
231,0.97,1290.088,1298.063,1/3 to 1/2 of juveniles Interrogated by the police do not understand they have the right to remain silent and to consult an attorney.,64,,
232,0.97,1298.063,1304.036,"Because juveniles often do not understand their rights, they often waive them.",64,,
233,0.97,1304.036,1311.043,90% of juveniles Interrogated by police waive their constitutional right to remain silent.,64,,
234,0.97,1311.043,1316.014,"It can have devastating consequences for young people, especially young people of color.",64,,
235,0.97,1316.014,1327.025,One study over a 15-year period found juveniles falsely confessed to crimes three times as often than as adults.,64,,
236,0.97,1327.025,1330.262,The city of Seattle must do more to protect young people.,64,,
237,0.97,1330.262,1339.204,We must approve this ordinance and require law enforcement to provide youth with an attorney before forcing them to decide whether to waive their constitutional rights.,64,,
238,0.97,1339.204,1339.471,Thank you.,64,,
239,0.97,1339.471,1343.342,Thank you for calling in today.,65,,

243,0.97,1359.591,1363.328,I wanted to Chime in and follow what all the other speakers are saying.,66,,
244,0.97,1363.328,1384.383,"I basically imagine myself, or you can imagine yourself being a 16-year-old teenager being detained by a group of grown men that have been trained in law enforcement tactics and being asked question after question after question and being almost coerced or talked in to admitting something of a crime they're trying to solve.",66,,
245,0.97,1384.383,1390.889,This has happened so many times in our black and Brown communities to our black and Brown children.,66,,
246,0.97,1390.889,1399.664,The criminal justice system has decimated our communities and young people's in our communities freedom.,66,,
247,0.97,1399.664,1405.804,I'm here to support the Michance deal and I want you to understand that this shouldn't even be a question.,66,,
248,0.97,1405.804,1410.041,This is a constitutional right to have legal representation at any stage.,66,,
249,0.97,1410.041,1418.75,This is nothing short of child abuse if our kids aren't getting no legal representation before they have to interact with law enforcement.,66,,
250,0.97,1418.75,1419.017,Thank you.,66,,
251,0.97,1419.017,1421.553,Thank you for calling in today.,67,,

256,0.97,1433.665,1434.533,Go ahead.,69,,
257,0.97,1434.533,1435.867,How you guys doing?,70,,
258,0.97,1435.867,1439.271,My name is Desean neighbors.,70,,
259,0.97,1439.271,1451.183,I'm an Ambassador and I'm here in support of the Michance youth rights ordinance because I recognize the importance of youths having attorneys present when they're having any type of interaction with police.,70,,
260,0.97,1451.183,1455.12,They're unaware of so many things.,70,,
261,0.97,1455.12,1460.892,They're uneducated of so many things and it's not fair to them to make decisions they're unsure of.,70,,
262,0.97,1460.892,1468.9,Those decisions can impact their lives and records forever and we can't eliminate future opportunities for these guys because they said something or did something.,70,,
263,0.97,1468.9,1471.47,"Like DOM said, it really shouldn't even be a question.",70,,
264,0.97,1471.47,1472.737,I don't think anybody loses here.,70,,
265,0.97,1472.737,1477.175,We lost a lot of trust with the police in the community over the last years and all this.,70,,
266,0.97,1477.175,1482.347,"So in order to try to gain that trust back, this is something that I feel needs to happen.",70,,
267,0.97,1482.347,1483.815,That's all I got to say.,70,,
268,0.97,1483.815,1484.416,Thank you for your time.,70,,
269,0.97,1484.416,1488.019,Thank you for calling in today.,71,,

274,0.97,1500.665,1506.037,I'm here to testify on the proposed youth right to counsel ordinance.,72,,
275,0.97,1506.037,1519.317,There's been over 200 years of policing in this country and it's risen from a sort of rag tag band of slave catchers to a modern Militarized policing force.,72,,
276,0.97,1519.317,1530.762,"While it's incomprehensible such a force would be turned on the citizenry of the city, it's even more reprehensible that this force would be let loose on the children of the city today.",72,,
277,0.97,1530.762,1540.238,"When police Interrogate children, there are virtually no differences between the Interrogations of them and adults.",72,,
278,0.97,1540.238,1545.076,False promise that the only person on their side is the very officer who has them backed into a corner.,72,,
279,0.97,1545.076,1552.651,This could be done without the presence of an attorney should shock the conscience of each of us.,72,,
280,0.97,1552.651,1559.791,The Prosecutor's office cites the erosion of trust as one of the many Fallacies they listed in opposition to this bill.,72,,
281,0.97,1559.791,1564.062,But you cannot erode what is not there.,72,,
282,0.97,1564.062,1566.464,You build trust through honesty.,72,,
283,0.97,1566.464,1567.832,You build trust through transparency.,72,,
284,0.97,1567.832,1573.905,You build trust by ensuring that every child is afforded every single right that is available to them.,72,,
285,0.97,1573.905,1576.908,I hope this committee will consider passing this ordinance.,72,,
286,0.97,1576.908,1577.342,Thank you very much.,72,,

299,0.97,1635.233,1636.067,It's very important.,79,,
300,0.97,1636.067,1652.05,It will give us peace to be able to pay the rent and also support our family.,79,,
301,0.97,1652.05,1674.673,Our city of Seattle Mayor Durkin because never done anything and she's working on that.,79,,

311,0.97,1704.269,1705.603,And they are children.,81,,
312,0.97,1705.603,1725.256,"It's unjustifiable to me that we'd put our youth in Intimidating high PRESSUE in situations where they may unknowingly waive their rights especially when the majority of youth in these interactions are black, indigenous, or other youth of color.",81,,
313,0.97,1725.256,1737.769,"In 2019, approximately 86% of youth jailed and in 2018, 73% of those charged were black, indigenous, or other youth of color.",81,,
314,0.97,1737.769,1746.211,It is important we pass the ordinance to protect our children so they may make informed decisions with the support of a public defender before they waive constitutional rights.,81,,
315,0.97,1746.211,1764.195,"Lastly, I urge the Council to Defund SPD by 50% at least in the upcoming 2021 budget process and use Participatory budgeting so our youth have power to protect our youth and listen to our youth.",81,,

330,0.97,1844.943,1845.677,Talk to drivers.,83,,
331,0.97,1845.677,1846.611,We are the drivers.,83,,
332,0.97,1846.611,1853.651,"Uber did a study, they did not talk to a single driver.",83,,
333,0.97,1853.651,1859.457,"They might have record on the App and where we drop, how much they pay us, how much they charge.",83,,
334,0.97,1859.457,1868.9,But they don't have any idea what we go through in our life.,83,,
335,0.97,1868.9,1876.674,"What we go through with our families, medically, everything.",83,,
336,0.97,1876.674,1878.576,Drivers just to make ends meet.,83,,

344,0.97,1896.461,1900.031,Hi.,85,,
345,0.97,1900.031,1909.474,This is Howard from lower Queen Anne district 7 speaking in support of the ordinance in honor of Michance Dunlap Gittens.,85,,
346,0.97,1909.474,1915.513,And also the resolution supporting the Federal George Floyd justice policing act.,85,,
347,0.97,1915.513,1925.923,"However, I'm very confused as to why the Council is calling for the Federal Government to take action all of which would be taken locally by yourself.",85,,
348,0.97,1925.923,1936.267,Especially given the reality that this Federal bill will never pass the U.S. Senate.,85,,
349,0.97,1936.267,1958.823,"Similarly you call on limiting qualified immunity on the Federal level when we can make qualified immunity irrelevant by helping to create a state, a Washington state legal action so that families traumatized by police abuse and violence could see justice in court.",85,,
350,0.97,1958.823,1962.961,Please do not ask the Feds to do what you will not.,85,,

352,0.97,1970.034,1977.408,His murder ignored by our supposed police accountability partners and also ignored by you folks on the Council.,85,,
353,0.97,1977.408,1986.417,Do we only protest those killed by police not under our authority and who are 1600 miles away?,85,,
354,0.97,1986.417,2002.333,"Please, I beg the Council re-evaluate what our police are doing, not just speeding up demonstrators but consistently killing dozens of people in the last few years and please be Proactive.",85,,

358,0.97,2007.839,2009.474,My name is Catherine Dawson.,87,,
359,0.97,2009.474,2011.642,I'm a district Renter and a former teacher.,87,,
360,0.97,2011.642,2014.779,I'm calling to voice my support for the ordinance in honor of Michance Dunlap Gittens.,87,,
361,0.97,2014.779,2023.921,"Thank you to all the community organizers, legal advocates, and the family who testified to the importance of this ordinance.",87,,
362,0.97,2023.921,2031.362,We need this ordinance to protect our youth.,87,,
363,0.97,2031.362,2038.97,"A quick example, for my personal experience, I was a juror on a felony case a few years ago for a 16-year-old who's being tried as an adult.",87,,
364,0.97,2038.97,2045.676,The entire case hinged on the Video of police Interrogations which happened after he waived his right to counsel.,87,,
365,0.97,2045.676,2049.414,The 16-year-old was for hours without allowed to call his mother or a lawyer.,87,,
366,0.97,2049.414,2051.516,He sat alone in the police station.,87,,
367,0.97,2051.516,2053.484,He didn't know what would happen.,87,,
368,0.97,2053.484,2054.952,He didn't have any adult.,87,,
369,0.97,2054.952,2065.496,At the anything he's asked to sign to waive his rights and we have Video that he's barely looking at the paper.,87,,
370,0.97,2065.496,2067.098,He Verifies all the information is correct.,87,,
371,0.97,2067.098,2071.569,"When we as the jury see this paper, we see his birthday is wrong.",87,,
372,0.97,2071.569,2074.806,And conveniently this incorrect birthday makes him 18 not 16.,87,,
373,0.97,2074.806,2089.887,"So after hours at the station, faced with the police officers without any adult, this kid is agreeing to a mistake in his own birthday and the law allows him to waive his legal right.",87,,
374,0.97,2089.887,2096.36,"After waiving those rights, he's subjected to a 20-Minute interrogation that is increasingly aggressive.",87,,
375,0.97,2096.36,2103.034,At one point the officer who committed the crime and points directly at the defendant to suggest who the answer is.,87,,
376,0.97,2103.034,2109.073,Those 20 minutes determine the rest of his life and we know young people are more vulnerable to police coercion.,87,,
377,0.97,2109.073,2112.91,That's one example of many that I know you've heard about.,87,,
378,0.97,2112.91,2129.794,"We hold children to this absurd and harmful standard, expecting them to have an in-depth understanding of their legal rights and the implication of signing this piece of paper.",87,,
379,0.97,2129.794,2131.229,Our youth deserve better.,87,,
380,0.97,2131.229,2138.102,Please vote yes on the youth rights ordinance and introduce legislation to close these now.,87,,
381,0.97,2138.102,2146.477,Thank you for calling in today.,88,,
382,0.97,2146.477,2152.15,Next up is Lata.,88,,
383,0.97,2152.15,2159.49,Is Lata on the line?,89,,
384,0.97,2159.49,2160.758,Lata is on the line.,90,,
385,0.97,2160.758,2171.168,"Lata, remember to hit Star 6 so we can hear you.",91,,
386,0.97,2171.168,2174.672,"Can you hear me, Councilmember?",92,,
387,0.97,2174.672,2176.007,We can hear you now.,93,,
388,0.97,2176.007,2176.874,Go ahead.,93,,

392,0.97,2185.216,2196.928,"For many years, drivers have been fighting together with the Union on top of our other driver Union.",94,,
393,0.97,2196.928,2215.913,The need for fair pay and address equity is more important now more than ever from immigrant drivers on the front lines of pandemic.,94,,
394,0.97,2215.913,2231.362,"And the majority of these drivers are specially from African immigrant, from place like Ethiopian, Somali, many more.",94,,
395,0.97,2231.362,2253.184,This fair pay is our main issue of no one less than minimum or living wage after expenses or a voice of joint.,94,,
396,0.97,2253.184,2263.761,"We look forward to work with you, Councilmember, after you get back from holiday to make drivers a living wage.",94,,
397,0.97,2263.761,2266.497,Thank you for your time.,94,,
398,0.97,2266.497,2267.064,"Thank you, Councilmember.",94,,

400,0.97,2275.906,2280.077,"Good afternoon, Councilmembers.",96,,
401,0.97,2280.077,2284.282,I first want to lift up the Michance Dunlap Gittens family.,96,,
402,0.97,2284.282,2289.153,I know you're taking on more emotional labor than any of us can imagine by being here.,96,,
403,0.97,2289.153,2292.256,So I wanted to lift that up first.,96,,
404,0.97,2292.256,2296.827,My name is Elena and I serve as a Commissioner for the community police Commission.,96,,
405,0.97,2296.827,2307.738,And I'm here today on behalf of the CPC to support the Michance Dunlap Gittens youth rights ordinance.,96,,
406,0.97,2307.738,2311.042,"Michance Dunlap Gittens was a poet, a student, and a son.",96,,
407,0.97,2311.042,2318.516,He was just 17 years old when he was killed during the investigation of a crime he did not commit.,96,,
408,0.97,2318.516,2327.658,"Seattle confronts the impacts of policing and Reimagines justice, among our first task is ensuring constitutional rights of our young people are protected.",96,,
409,0.97,2327.658,2338.769,The CPC stands in solidarity with the many community organizations along with the youth they uplift who have led this movement and expressed their support for this legislation.,96,,
410,0.97,2338.769,2349.747,"They're uniquely qualified to know how best to protect our young people, especially black, indigenous, and other youth of color who have faith in outside impact of our criminal justice system.",96,,
411,0.97,2349.747,2355.486,"The King County Council is working to pass this ordinance with strong support from community leaders, young people, and youth advocates.",96,,
412,0.97,2355.486,2362.993,"I urge you, we urge you, to act alongside to ensure all our young people in Seattle are protected.",96,,
413,0.97,2362.993,2371.202,"Our youth do not live, play, or learn with a single municipal boundary.",96,,
414,0.97,2371.202,2384.248,"The CPC wants to uplift and thank choose 180, community passage ways, community justice, and many other community organizations who have progressed this work.",96,,
415,0.97,2384.248,2387.618,"Council President, I'd like to yield the rest of my time.",96,,
416,0.97,2387.618,2392.323,Thank you and the Commission for taking a strong position on this bill.,97,,
417,0.97,2392.323,2392.79,Really appreciate it.,97,,
418,0.97,2392.79,2396.293,"Colleagues, we're close to the end of public comment period.",97,,
419,0.97,2396.293,2402.099,We only have a few more folks who signed up to give public comment today.,97,,
420,0.97,2402.099,2408.038,"If there's no objection, I'd like to extend the public comment period by an additional 20 minutes.",97,,
421,0.97,2408.038,2416.38,"Hearing no objection, we'll extend the public comment period for another 20 minutes.",97,,
422,0.97,2416.38,2431.862,"Thank thank you very much, Councilmember for the opportunity giving me again and again.",98,,
423,0.97,2431.862,2432.163,Thank you.,98,,
424,0.97,2432.163,2464.261,"We know since the pandemic has started--on your desk right now and we know you are going to support black lives matter, the many people and we appreciate what you are doing for everybody.",98,,
425,0.97,2464.261,2472.269,"You are really doing a great job, working very hard 24/7.",98,,
426,0.97,2472.269,2479.643,We are feeding our families.,98,,
427,0.97,2479.643,2481.712,This is not our part-time job.,98,,
428,0.97,2481.712,2486.684,This is our full-time job.,98,,
429,0.97,2486.684,2490.187,We want to pay rent and put food on the table and everything.,98,,
430,0.97,2490.187,2508.138,And we see that nowadays Uber and pay insurance and everything and all that.,98,,

433,0.97,2535.099,2535.633,Thank you very much.,98,,
434,0.97,2535.633,2537.434,Thank you for calling in.,99,,
435,0.97,2537.434,2543.541,Next up is Katie followed by Jennifer.,99,,
436,0.97,2543.541,2547.344,Hello.,100,,
437,0.97,2547.344,2558.789,I'm the assistant special counsel for issues related to young people at the King County Department of public defense.,100,,
438,0.97,2558.789,2564.895,Providing public comment and strong support of the Michance Dunlap Gittens youth rights ordinance.,100,,
439,0.97,2564.895,2575.072,"One day last spring, as I finished another youth rights presentation, a 15-year-old who was living in a group home looked at me in disbelief as I explained his constitutional rights.",100,,
440,0.97,2575.072,2579.61,"At the end, all he said to me was, that's not how it works.",100,,
441,0.97,2579.61,2584.048,"I tried to protest and explain the law and the constitutional, but he was right.",100,,
442,0.97,2584.048,2592.423,I have watched too many videos where I've seen an armed police officer Interrogating a scared kid in the backs of a patrol car.,100,,
443,0.97,2592.423,2609.34,"Rights are read like it's the Indy 500 and a child, usually a black child, indigenous child is Interrogated by a police officer.",100,,
444,0.97,2609.34,2616.18,Studies show youths are more vulnerable to police coercion and have a harder time understanding their own rights.,100,,
445,0.97,2616.18,2623.354,"To ensure they do not waive their rights because they're too scared to assert them, they need to consult with a lawyer.",100,,
446,0.97,2623.354,2638.435,"In an extraordinary open letter to the legal community urging lawyers to take steps to confront racial injustice, the Supreme Court justices have said the injustices faced are not relics of the past.",100,,
447,0.97,2638.435,2647.945,We continue to see Racialized policing and the Overrepresentation of black Americans in every stage of our criminal and juvenile justice systems.,100,,
448,0.97,2647.945,2653.35,"Last year 86% of the youth jailed in King County were black youth, indigenous youth, and youth of color.",100,,
449,0.97,2653.35,2658.188,Reporter:% of the youth prosecuted.,101,,
450,0.97,2658.188,2658.789,It's shocking and appalling.,101,,
451,0.97,2658.789,2663.527,Our system is built on racism and our youth are unfairly accepted in our communities.,101,,
452,0.97,2663.527,2670.668,I urge each of you to pass the Michance Dunlap Gittens youth rights ordinance to enable a more racially just future.,101,,
453,0.97,2670.668,2670.934,Thank you.,101,,
454,0.97,2670.934,2672.603,Thank you for calling in.,102,,
455,0.97,2672.603,2680.31,"Next up is Jennifer, followed by Alisa.",102,,
456,0.97,2680.31,2681.412,Good afternoon.,103,,
457,0.97,2681.412,2683.781,I'm a resident of district 6.,103,,
458,0.97,2683.781,2700.831,"Every time I find a way to be present and sign up for public comment, I find it belittling to have 45 seconds to speak on legislation that specifically impacts our lives.",103,,
459,0.97,2700.831,2704.902,The Michance Dunlap Gittens ordinance before you is critical and I join in support that it be passed.,103,,
460,0.97,2704.902,2710.741,Thank you to his family and others involved for caring enough for other young people in the community to help us treat them better.,103,,
461,0.97,2710.741,2716.08,It is not just important to declare our support for the representative Jayapal's legislation.,103,,
462,0.97,2716.08,2718.749,It is more important to act and enact some of our own.,103,,
463,0.97,2718.749,2724.021,I can't help but view this with skepticism as an agenda item and vote.,103,,
464,0.97,2724.021,2737.0,"Once again it shows talk that superficial character and inaction, taking action will not be comfortable, especially if it meets the long overdue needs of our neighbors and community members.",103,,
465,0.97,2737.0,2737.267,Thank you.,103,,
466,0.97,2737.267,2743.774,Thank you for calling in today.,104,,
467,0.97,2743.774,2746.643,Next up is Alisa.,104,,
468,0.97,2746.643,2748.045,Hi.,105,,
469,0.97,2748.045,2751.348,I'm a staff attorney with team child.,105,,
470,0.97,2751.348,2755.986,Team child provides several legal representation to youths ages 12 to 24 in King County.,105,,
471,0.97,2755.986,2764.161,"These youths are often involved and impacted in the court system, including the juvenile justice system.",105,,
472,0.97,2764.161,2767.931,"Team child wholeheartedly supports the ordinance, the Michance Dunlap Gittens youth ordinance.",105,,
473,0.97,2767.931,2788.018,"We support the ordinance for reasons already highlighted, including the need to ensure that youths are being able to fully understand the consequences of their decisions before they speak to the police because as we know, the adolescent brain is not capable of functioning in the same way that an adult is.",105,,
474,0.97,2788.018,2794.858,We also know there's greater harm caused to black and Brown youth that are deemed disproportionately Interrogated by the police.,105,,
475,0.97,2794.858,2802.132,Team child wants to highlight further counsel the additional harm interrogation causes on the youth's access to education.,105,,
476,0.97,2802.132,2806.003,Police contact in the schools is something that happens regularly.,105,,
477,0.97,2806.003,2814.444,Often with the support of school administrators and leads to additional coercion and pressure on youth to cooperate and make statements to the police.,105,,
478,0.97,2814.444,2821.251,Some of these youth have learning disabilities that further prevent their ability to understand their rights in these situations.,105,,
479,0.97,2821.251,2827.558,Many youth after talking to the police are removed from their schools and then lose access to educational services.,105,,
480,0.97,2827.558,2836.833,The contact with the police at school causes further trauma that can be humiliating and destroy the youth's trust and relationships at their schools.,105,,
481,0.97,2836.833,2843.473,"After the police Interrogations, youth often feel unsafe and unsupported at school and some do not return to school at all.",105,,
482,0.97,2843.473,2851.949,"In closing, we ask you to please pass the ordinance and decrease the harm caused by interactions on our youth with police at schools and other places.",105,,
483,0.97,2851.949,2855.619,Thank you for your time.,105,,
484,0.97,2855.619,2862.125,Thank you for calling in.,106,,
485,0.97,2862.125,2869.9,I'm a Seattle resident.,107,,
486,0.97,2869.9,2875.038,I'm calling to strongly advocate for passage of the youth rights ordinance.,107,,
487,0.97,2875.038,2884.047,"This is such an important move to provide basic rights to youth, especially black and Brown youth who have the most traumatic encounters with police.",107,,
488,0.97,2884.047,2892.756,We talk about being an Anti-Racist city and this ordinance is a necessary step and long overdue to move toward that.,107,,
489,0.97,2892.756,2896.994,Please pass this and pass it with complete majority so there's no doubt.,107,,
490,0.97,2896.994,2909.373,"I actually had a couple quotes I had read from youth, from black and Brown communities, who were impacted by this and I can't even fathom the impact it had on them.",107,,
491,0.97,2909.373,2922.219,I wanted to highlight the courageous testimony from Michance's parents and the greatest fight they've carried out with community leaders and organizations and supporters.,107,,
492,0.97,2922.219,2922.953,They're all inspirations.,107,,
493,0.97,2922.953,2924.955,Look forward to you taking action on this.,107,,
494,0.97,2924.955,2925.956,And thank you for your time.,107,,
495,0.97,2925.956,2927.925,Thank you for calling in.,108,,
496,0.97,2927.925,2940.07,Next up is Anna followed by Maria.,108,,
497,0.97,2940.07,2947.01,Do we have Anna on the line with us?,109,,
498,0.97,2947.01,2951.148,You need to hit Star 6 so we can hear you.,109,,
499,0.97,2951.148,2951.348,Hi.,110,,
500,0.97,2951.348,2952.983,I got it now.,110,,
501,0.97,2952.983,2955.952,We can hear you.,111,,
502,0.97,2955.952,2956.386,Go ahead.,111,,
503,0.97,2956.386,2957.854,Good afternoon.,112,,
504,0.97,2957.854,2963.593,My name is Anna Bonilla and I'm with enterprise community partners.,112,,
505,0.97,2963.593,2969.9,I'm here in support of Childcare ordinance which passed by the land use committee last week and is before you today.,112,,
506,0.97,2969.9,2977.541,I want to thank Councilmember Strauss as chair of the land use committee and sponsor of the bill for bringing this important bill forward.,112,,
507,0.97,2977.541,2983.313,I want to thank the other members of the Council that have worked tirelessly on issues related to Childcare for today.,112,,
508,0.97,2983.313,2994.624,We're in a moment of time where we realize who takes care of our children matters to all of us.,112,,
509,0.97,2994.624,2995.292,Cochbd has changed everything.,112,,
510,0.97,2995.292,3000.13,It's changing the way we work and the way we think about our neighborhood.,112,,
511,0.97,3000.13,3014.244,The changes will allow for Childcare options that are closer to home as we navigate work from home for the foreseeable future.,112,,
512,0.97,3014.244,3028.091,"Almostly, providers may have an opportunity to be increasingly innovative in creating centers across the city.",112,,
513,0.97,3028.091,3040.036,We hope more of this innovation in helping Childcare and early learning throughout the city.,112,,
514,0.97,3040.036,3042.672,We are certainly thankful.,112,,
515,0.97,3042.672,3042.939,Thank you.,112,,
516,0.97,3042.939,3045.275,Thank you so much for calling in today.,113,,
517,0.97,3045.275,3047.344,"Colleagues, we have about four people left.",113,,
518,0.97,3047.344,3050.68,So we're getting close to the end of our list.,113,,
519,0.97,3050.68,3060.056,Next up is Maria followed by Stephanie Lowry.,113,,
520,0.97,3060.056,3072.269,"Maria, if you're on the line with us, make sure you hit Star 6 so we can hear you.",113,,
521,0.97,3072.269,3080.11,"Maria, you there?",113,,
522,0.97,3080.11,3095.392,"Just as a reminder, you have to hit Star and the number 6 so we can hear you.",113,,
523,0.97,3095.392,3107.804,We're still not hearing Maria so we're going to go ahead and move to the next Speaker and I'll circle back to Maria in the event we can get her on the line.,113,,
524,0.97,3107.804,3115.946,Next up is Stephanie followed by Maddy.,113,,
525,0.97,3115.946,3118.148,"Good afternoon, Councilmembers.",114,,
526,0.97,3118.148,3129.092,"My name is Stephanie Lowry and I'm calling to join community members to urge you to give your support for Council bill 119840, the Michance Dunlap Gittens youth right to counsel ordinance.",114,,
527,0.97,3129.092,3134.397,I've had the privilege to work with youth currently incarcerated here in Washington over the last three years.,114,,
528,0.97,3134.397,3145.242,"I've personally seen the damaging impacts on the lives of youth who are incarcerated, many of whom were not aware of the consequence they would face by waiving their constitutional rights prior to speaking with a public defender.",114,,
529,0.97,3145.242,3150.413,It is not a coincidence that these youth are primarily black youth and youth of color.,114,,
530,0.97,3150.413,3155.752,"As a community, we must understand we'll never have Újustice until our youth are provided equal justice under all.",114,,
531,0.97,3155.752,3159.389,I thank you for your action on this matter.,114,,
532,0.97,3159.389,3160.79,And I'll yield the rest of my time.,114,,
533,0.97,3160.79,3163.56,Thank you so much for calling in.,115,,
534,0.97,3163.56,3169.9,Next up is Maddy.,115,,
535,0.97,3169.9,3170.267,Followed by Joe.,115,,
536,0.97,3170.267,3173.403,Hello.,116,,
537,0.97,3173.403,3177.974,I'm calling in in regards to the Michance Dunlap Gittens youth rights ordinance.,116,,
538,0.97,3177.974,3184.681,"Unfortunately, we have a system which arrests and Incarcerates our youth instead of providing Preventative services and action for them.",116,,
539,0.97,3184.681,3191.321,"We all know right now, your frontal lobe, which controls impulse control and other things, is not developed until you're 25 years old.",116,,
540,0.97,3191.321,3200.53,How in the world do we expect a terrified child into waving their Miranda rights.,116,,
541,0.97,3200.53,3203.967,This is not acceptable to society that we're allowing this to happen.,116,,
542,0.97,3203.967,3205.569,We're not protecting our children.,116,,
543,0.97,3205.569,3210.507,"Lastly, I really want to thank Michance Dunlap Gittens' parents for your comments today.",116,,
544,0.97,3210.507,3214.711,Your strength after tragedy is evident and I'm so sorry you have to be here today.,116,,
545,0.97,3214.711,3218.882,Michance should still be with us.,116,,
546,0.97,3218.882,3220.05,Next up is Joe.,117,,
547,0.97,3220.05,3228.191,We'll circle back to Maria.,117,,
548,0.97,3228.191,3231.761,"Thank you, Council President.",118,,
549,0.97,3231.761,3233.863,I'm going to make this incredibly easy.,118,,
550,0.97,3233.863,3244.874,Last night I learned fireworks were fired at police.,118,,
551,0.97,3244.874,3249.746,It's important to protect journalists from that awful subpoena.,118,,
552,0.97,3249.746,3255.719,Obviously there's nothing wrong with supporting that and nothing wrong with passing ordinance 119840.,118,,
553,0.97,3255.719,3268.064,I would hope when you discuss resolution 31963 that you and the Council condemn the use of fireworks under weapons against the police.,118,,
554,0.97,3268.064,3269.899,We don't need violent outbursts here.,118,,
555,0.97,3269.899,3278.108,We need to reform law enforcement and stand with the cops.,118,,
556,0.97,3278.108,3291.388,"When this kind of rioting goes on around my sound transit, I take it a little personally, and I'd appreciate if efforts were extended to protect the sound transit headquarters.",118,,
557,0.97,3291.388,3303.9,"Sound transit is going to lose the people around to jobs and opportunity and as we fight racism globally, I'm sure we could all agree that we need to protect sound transit from rioting.",118,,
558,0.97,3303.9,3318.448,"We also need to, again, condemn the horrible use of fireworks and Pyrotechnic weapons against the police as we seek to work with law enforcement to find means to De-Escalate situations.",118,,
559,0.97,3318.448,3324.02,I'm concerned how far this could go without that condemnation.,118,,
560,0.97,3324.02,3326.322,I really hope everyone in Seattle stays safe.,118,,
561,0.97,3326.322,3332.762,"I hope my comments were civil, respectful, and if they're not, I do apologize.",118,,
562,0.97,3332.762,3340.303,"I'll always appreciate you, Council President Gonzalez when it comes to standing up for our comments.",118,,
563,0.97,3340.303,3342.372,You've done an exemplary job.,118,,
564,0.97,3342.372,3343.073,Thank you.,119,,
565,0.97,3343.073,3352.048,"Next up is and hopefully we'll be able to hear her now, is Maria.",119,,
566,0.97,3352.048,3360.09,"Maria, are you there?",120,,
567,0.97,3360.09,3367.897,Looks like we're having challenges with that particular connection.,120,,
568,0.97,3367.897,3372.769,Unfortunately we're going to have to go ahead and move along since we do have a busy agenda before us today.,120,,
569,0.97,3372.769,3377.674,Sorry that we weren't able to hear from you.,120,,
570,0.97,3377.674,3390.587,We're going to go ahead and conclude public comment for today and go ahead and move into items of business on our agenda.,120,,
571,0.97,3390.587,3396.259,Next up is payment of the bills.,120,,
572,0.97,3396.259,3402.198,Will the clerk please read the title.,120,,
573,0.97,3402.198,3412.675,Council bill 11986 Four4.,121,,
574,0.97,3414.411,3415.912,Thank you Madam clerk.,122,,
575,0.97,3415.912,3419.816,I move to pass Council bill 119864.,122,,
576,0.97,3419.816,3420.65,Is there a second?,122,,
577,0.97,3420.65,3420.917,Second.,123,,
578,0.97,3420.917,3424.053,It's been moved and Seconded that the bill pass.,124,,
579,0.97,3424.053,3424.854,Are there any comments?,124,,
580,0.97,3424.854,3431.861,"Hearing none, will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill.",124,,
581,0.97,3431.861,3449.946,[roll call] seven in favor.,125,,
582,0.97,3449.946,3450.48,None opposed.,125,,
583,0.97,3450.48,3452.115,"Thank you, Madam clerk.",126,,
584,0.97,3452.115,3454.551,The bill passes.,126,,
585,0.97,3454.551,3459.789,Will the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation.,126,,
586,0.97,3459.789,3460.023,Item 1.,126,,
587,0.97,3460.023,3468.164,Will the clerk read the short title of item 1 into the record.,126,,
588,0.97,3468.164,3479.642,"Relating to land use and zoning, modifying use, and development standards to remove regulatory impediments and to allow the citing of Childcare centers throughout the city.",126,,
589,0.97,3479.642,3481.01,The committee recommends the bill pass.,126,,
590,0.97,3481.01,3483.279,"Thank you, Madam clerk.",127,,
591,0.97,3483.279,3490.887,"Councilmember Strauss, as the chair of the committee, you are recognized in order to provide the committee report on this item.",127,,
592,0.97,3490.887,3494.724,"Thank you, Council President.",128,,
593,0.97,3494.724,3498.828,I'm happy and excited to bring my first bill today.,128,,
594,0.97,3498.828,3502.699,Addressing Childcare was and remains one of my top priorities and first priorities.,128,,
595,0.97,3502.699,3519.482,"Childcare touches on so many different issues, from Affordability of our city to how equitable our neighborhoods are to how we support working parents and particularly working Moms who are disproportionately impacted by the Childcare shortage.",128,,
596,0.97,3519.482,3537.8,"I hear from so many people, from neighbors and friends alike about the Childcare shortage and how it impacts daily life from how we commute to where we choose to live to how we travel to and from when people need to go outside of the city to receive the Childcare they need.",128,,
597,0.97,3537.8,3542.238,I've heard of Waitlists spanning many years.,128,,
598,0.97,3542.238,3546.009,This bill is not a single solution to the Affordability and accessibility challenges we face.,128,,
599,0.97,3546.009,3553.049,And we have much more work to do to make Childcare affordable and accessible throughout Seattle.,128,,
600,0.97,3553.049,3563.76,"As land use chair, I propose the Childcare near you ordinance because with so many challenges related to Childcare, the land use code should not be an additional barrier.",128,,
601,0.97,3563.76,3577.907,"This bill fixes that by removing this legislation will make Childcare a permitted use in all zones, removing the conditional use permit that adds an average of five months to Childcare permitting.",128,,
602,0.97,3577.907,3586.583,It allows for greater flexibility in Siting and Incentivize developers to build more Childcare space.,128,,
603,0.97,3586.583,3592.622,And it makes several other technical adjustments to ease the development of Childcare across the city.,128,,
604,0.97,3592.622,3603.199,"New Childcare facilities will still be subject to city permitting and are still regulated for health and safety by Washington State Department of children, youth, and families.",128,,
605,0.97,3603.199,3614.844,I started working on this legislation in January and land use legislation takes a long time due to environmental Scoping regulations and requirements for noticing of public input.,128,,
606,0.97,3614.844,3620.984,"Since I began working on this, Covid-19 pandemic has made addressing Childcare even more urgent.",128,,
607,0.97,3620.984,3636.065,I'm excited for us to take this step today and allow for more Childcare near working parents and in neighborhoods throughout the city.,128,,
608,0.97,3636.065,3641.371,I couldn't have done this work without your help.,128,,
609,0.97,3641.371,3651.781,"This legislation, Childcare near you, will encourage more Childcare in neighborhoods across the city and more Childcare near you.",128,,
610,0.97,3651.781,3653.082,"Thank you, Council President that's the report.",128,,
611,0.97,3653.082,3656.519,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",129,,
612,0.97,3656.519,3658.087,Are there any comments on the bill?,129,,
613,0.97,3658.087,3661.391,Looks like no other Councilmembers have any comments on the bill.,129,,
614,0.97,3661.391,3675.371,"Councilmember Strauss, I want to thank you for this important piece of legislation to address some of the land use and Siting realities of Childcare facilities throughout the city.",129,,
615,0.97,3675.371,3705.468,I also want to thank our labor partners over at Sciu925 who I know are following this bill very closely and I want to acknowledge a lot of the work that our congressional delegation have done at the Federal level in this period of Covid to address some of the funding issues associated with being able to access Childcare as a working parent.,129,,
616,0.97,3705.468,3711.307,So I truly appreciate that this is one piece of a greater puzzle.,129,,
617,0.97,3711.307,3736.866,I have been working diligently for many years on the Council advocating for additional funding and access to affordable Childcare and Pre-K and do see this as another building block and another opportunity for us to address the realities of the Childcare desert that exists here in Washington State and in Seattle/King County.,129,,
618,0.97,3736.866,3746.409,I will be proudly voting in favor of this Council bill and appreciate all the work you've done to get us to this point.,129,,
619,0.97,3746.409,3747.443,"Thank you, Council President.",130,,
620,0.97,3747.443,3755.985,It's great to get to take up some of the work that you and Councilmember Mosqueda and Councilmember Bagshaw were working on last year and there's Úa lot more work to do.,130,,
621,0.97,3755.985,3764.16,Happy to be a partner and thanks to all the colleagues who wanted to Cosign on this bill.,130,,
622,0.97,3764.16,3765.261,"Thank you, everyone.",130,,
623,0.97,3765.261,3767.263,Of course.,131,,
624,0.97,3767.263,3767.797,"Okay, colleagues.",131,,
625,0.97,3767.797,3769.232,There are no other comments on the bill.,131,,
626,0.97,3769.232,3771.534,I'm going to go ahead and close out debate.,131,,
627,0.97,3771.534,3778.841,I'd ask the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill.,131,,
628,0.97,3778.841,3792.255,[roll call] seven in favor.,132,,
629,0.97,3792.255,3793.923,None opposed.,132,,
630,0.97,3793.923,3797.226,"Thank you, Madam clerk.",133,,
631,0.97,3797.226,3800.229,The bill passes and the chair will sign it.,133,,
632,0.97,3800.229,3803.866,Can the clerk affix my signature to the legislation on my behalf.,133,,
633,0.97,3803.866,3805.635,Item number 2.,133,,
634,0.97,3805.635,3808.938,Will the clerk read agenda item 2 into the record.,133,,
635,0.97,3808.938,3811.641,Agenda item 2.,134,,
636,0.97,3811.641,3812.241,Council bill 119840.,134,,
637,0.97,3812.241,3850.78,"An ordinance named in honor of Michance Dunlap Gittens and relating to the Seattle police Department, prohibiting law enforcement officers from questioning, except in limited circumstances, persons 18 years of age or younger where a Miranda warning is administered unless legal counsel is provided; prohibiting law enforcement officers from requesting permission from a person under 18 years of age to conduct a search of the person or property, dwellings, or vehicles under that person's control unless legal counsel is provided for that person; and adding a new section 3.28.147 to the Seattle municipal code.",134,,
638,0.97,3850.78,3855.885,"Thank you, Madam clerk, for reading that in to the record.",135,,
639,0.97,3855.885,3860.056,I'll move to pass Council bill 119840.,135,,
640,0.97,3860.056,3860.69,Is there a second?,135,,
641,0.97,3860.69,3860.957,Second.,136,,
642,0.97,3860.957,3865.962,It's been moved and Seconded to pass the bill.,137,,
643,0.97,3865.962,3874.971,"Councilmember Morales, you are the prime sponsor of the bill and I know several of us are proud co-sponsors of this legislative effort.",137,,
644,0.97,3874.971,3881.611,So I'm going to go ahead and recognize you in order to address this item.,137,,
645,0.97,3881.611,3881.844,Please.,137,,
646,0.97,3881.844,3883.913,"Thank you, Council President.",138,,
647,0.97,3883.913,3884.347,"Thanks, everybody.",138,,
648,0.97,3884.347,3901.697,I do want to begin by thanking the parents of Michance for calling to testify in support of this bill in honor of their son.,138,,
649,0.97,3901.697,3921.851,"It would certainly be an easier path for them to keep a lower Profile and to grieve in isolation, but instead they've made the intentional choice to do what they can to empower other youth to understand that they have rights and really to keep the honor and legacy of Michance alive.",138,,
650,0.97,3921.851,3923.185,"Frank and Alexis, we mourn with you.",138,,
651,0.97,3923.185,3934.997,"And while we can't know your grief, we are grateful to know that the access we're taking today as a Council can change the path of youth here in Seattle and can inspire change in other places across the nation.",138,,
652,0.97,3934.997,3946.776,"As we've heard already, Michance was a 17-Year-Old high school senior from des Moines who had dreams of going to law school and had dreams of being a champion for the rights of young people.",138,,
653,0.97,3946.776,3953.916,He was tragically shot in King county by the King County law enforcement in 2017 before he had a chance to realize those dreams.,138,,
654,0.97,3953.916,3963.159,"And I'm certain that if Michance was here today, he'd be with us defending the rights of young people with regard to this ordinance.",138,,
655,0.97,3963.159,3970.166,This bill established safeguards for young people who are asked to waive their Miranda rights when detained by a police officer.,138,,
656,0.97,3970.166,3982.111,The bill would protect children under 18 by ensuring that they consult with Council prior to waiving their constitutional rights to interrogation or requests for searches.,138,,
657,0.97,3982.111,3996.025,The bill does include an exception that allows officers to Interrogate children without counsel if they reasonably believe the information sought is necessary to protect life from imminent threat.,138,,
658,0.97,3996.025,4014.643,"Colleagues, we've heard before when the community advocates and the public defenders were here at the beginning of August, we know that studies find that due to their continuing brain development, children may not have the mental capacity to make decisions that have serious long-term impacts on their lives.",138,,
659,0.97,4014.643,4028.09,"And means that when youth are in a situation where they may be approached or questioned by a police officer, they may have a harder time asserting their constitutional right to silence and their right to refuse to be searched.",138,,
660,0.97,4028.09,4034.864,We know children of color are disproportionately stopped by law enforcement and incarcerated.,138,,
661,0.97,4034.864,4041.771,"In King County, 73.2% of children charged in 2018 were children of color.",138,,
662,0.97,4041.771,4050.746,"Between January and September of 2019, 86.5% of youth incarcerated were children of color.",138,,
663,0.97,4050.746,4053.082,I'm going to say that again.,138,,
664,0.97,4053.082,4060.89,"In King County, between January and September of 2019, 86.5% of youth incarcerated were children of color.",138,,
665,0.97,4060.89,4067.596,I want to say for all of us that this is so much more than just a piece of legislation.,138,,
666,0.97,4067.596,4080.342,This is legal protection for young people and particularly for young people in my district whose life experienced dictates law enforcement does not necessarily have their best interest in mind.,138,,
667,0.97,4080.342,4084.814,Many people have spoken about the lack of trust between young people in particular and law enforcement.,138,,
668,0.97,4084.814,4093.856,"This is a recognition of the way that communities of color have been policed, particularly young black and Brown men.",138,,
669,0.97,4093.856,4100.362,Many people have spoken already about the need for protecting young people.,138,,
670,0.97,4100.362,4104.033,I want to thank the folks who called in.,138,,
671,0.97,4104.033,4119.448,We did receive a memo in July from the King County Prosecutor and from the sheriff's office where they state that this proposal would further erode trust between juveniles and law enforcement and lead to increased danger in the community.,138,,
672,0.97,4119.448,4125.254,"As John Goode has said and what other callers have said, you can't erode what's not there.",138,,
673,0.97,4125.254,4138.734,This ordinance is intended to help rebuild trust by ensuring young people have their rights protected and requiring that law enforcement assist them in seeking counsel before they are questioned.,138,,
674,0.97,4138.734,4146.242,I do want to say that young people can choose to assert their autonomy after they've been provided legal counsel.,138,,
675,0.97,4146.242,4149.578,They can still choose to speak to law Enforcemen if they want to.,138,,
676,0.97,4149.578,4153.883,The difference is we're demanding they have their right to counsel and that not be waived.,138,,
677,0.97,4153.883,4160.489,That we recognize interactions with law enforcement are inherently coercive because of the power Dynamics at play.,138,,
678,0.97,4160.489,4169.565,So we want young people to have the information they need to make informed decisions that would inevitably impact their lives.,138,,
679,0.97,4169.565,4185.781,The steps this counsel is taking would insure we protect our young people and this would be the first of many pieces that we need to do to dismantle the racism that's embedded in our criminal legal system and stop Te school to prison pipeline.,138,,
680,0.97,4185.781,4197.326,"As Councilmember Herbold mentioned this morning, this bill did pass in King County Council in their law and justice committee by a 4-1 vote.",138,,
681,0.97,4197.326,4200.095,I want to thank the Councilmember for his work.,138,,
682,0.97,4200.095,4215.978,This bill will be heard tomorrow in the full King County Council and I will also say that the county Council's law Department had no issues with the ordinance and were actually helpful in drafting it so that it could pass in the county level.,138,,
683,0.97,4215.978,4223.786,I'll have a closing remark but I will stop there and happy to take questions from our colleagues.,138,,
684,0.97,4223.786,4229.291,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales for those remarks.",139,,
685,0.97,4229.291,4229.992,Really appreciate it.,139,,
686,0.97,4229.992,4236.031,Are there any other comments on the bill?,139,,
687,0.97,4236.031,4240.469,Councilmember Herbold.,139,,
688,0.97,4240.469,4240.703,Please.,139,,
689,0.97,4240.703,4242.671,Thank you.,140,,
690,0.97,4242.671,4245.774,I've spoken numerous times about this bill.,140,,
691,0.97,4245.774,4251.313,I really appreciate the partnership of Councilmember Morales in developing it.,140,,
692,0.97,4251.313,4270.366,"And the main thing I wanted to really make a point to add is to thank you, Council President Gonzalez, for allowing us to hear this on our full council agenda during a period of time where we're not having regular committee meetings.",140,,
693,0.97,4270.366,4293.622,"It really is appreciated that the urgency for acting on this piece of legislation is shared by all of us on the Council and that there's such strong support for moving this forward in addition to Councilmember Morales, I want to also thank her staff.",140,,
694,0.97,4293.622,4293.922,My staff.,140,,
695,0.97,4293.922,4311.707,"And of course our friends at the public defense, Department of public defense, and all of the members of the public for their hard work on this legislation including the family members of Michance.",140,,
696,0.97,4311.707,4347.209,"It's just so important that we are able to honor his life with this critical reform that expresses our commitment to zero youth detention by recognizing that sometimes at the first interactions with law enforcement, those are the actions that often begin the types of interactions that can result in detention and dramatically changing people's lives.",140,,
697,0.97,4347.209,4358.487,"I also want to finally, in closing, just recognize, I think this is common sense of an approach.",140,,
698,0.97,4358.487,4373.001,"It is common sense to want to do everything that we can in our city to ensure that young people not only know what their rights are, they understand them and they know how to act upon them.",140,,
699,0.97,4373.001,4391.019,This is just really I think an important step that we as a Council can take to show that we not only understand that there is a power item balance between young people and law enforcement.,140,,
700,0.97,4391.019,4398.56,"We understand that there's reason for young people to not always trust those in power, particularly those in law enforcement.",140,,
701,0.97,4398.56,4407.136,And that we want to take this action because we care about our young people.,140,,
702,0.97,4407.136,4407.97,So thank you.,140,,
703,0.97,4407.97,4414.81,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",141,,
704,0.97,4414.81,4415.611,Councilmember Strauss.,141,,
705,0.97,4415.611,4420.249,I want to thank you for turning your grief into an important bill that we're taking up today.,142,,
706,0.97,4420.249,4425.687,I want to thank Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Herbold.,142,,
707,0.97,4425.687,4426.655,This is important legislation.,142,,
708,0.97,4426.655,4431.126,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",143,,
709,0.97,4431.126,4433.929,"Colleagues, are there any other comments on the bill?",143,,
710,0.97,4433.929,4463.992,"I want to say really quickly thank you also to Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Herbold for your work on this as one of several mothers on this city Council, I would be just completely horrified if I found out that my own child was detained and questioned without legal counsel available.",143,,
711,0.97,4463.992,4495.724,"So I think it's so important for us to make sure that we acknowledge how, as Councilmember Herbold said, how common this approach is and how overdue this legislation is in terms of providing this obvious legal protection to young folks who don't yet appreciate █The significance of their right to remain silent in the event that they are detained.",143,,
712,0.97,4495.724,4524.286,And this is a step forward in making sure the power dynamic that exists between law enforcement access to legal services that could quite literally make the difference between life in jail or liberty at home.,143,,
713,0.97,4524.286,4542.971,I think the action is so significant and I was proud to join up as a cosponsor and we'll be proudly supporting the passage of this Council bill here today.,143,,
714,0.97,4542.971,4551.88,"So colleagues, just want to go ahead and close out debate by handing it back over to Councilmember Morales who's going to bring it home for us before we call the roll.",143,,
715,0.97,4551.88,4552.581,"Thanks, everybody.",144,,
716,0.97,4552.581,4558.754,So I do just want to thank again the community members who brought this forward.,144,,
717,0.97,4558.754,4566.695,"Organizations like choose 180, creative justice, community Passageways, the King County Department of public defense.",144,,
718,0.97,4566.695,4577.439,I want to thank Greg who has been guiding us along the way and taking lots of questions and providing lots of information for us as we process how to incorporate the feedback that we've been hearing.,144,,
719,0.97,4577.439,4593.722,"And I do want to also thank my own staff who has spent hours working with public defenders, with community, to make sure that we are keeping our young people safe.",144,,
720,0.97,4593.722,4593.989,Thank you.,144,,
721,0.97,4593.989,4595.29,Ready to vote.,144,,

725,0.97,4606.535,4610.072,"Council President Gonzalez, I apologize.",146,,
726,0.97,4610.072,4612.941,"Councilmember Morales, did you want to add one more before voting on it?",146,,
727,0.97,4612.941,4613.642,I'm sorry.,147,,
728,0.97,4613.642,4615.043,I did not hear your question.,147,,
729,0.97,4615.043,4620.048,Did you want to add one more sponsor to this bill before we vote on it?,148,,
730,0.97,4620.048,4621.917,"Oh, sorry.",149,,
731,0.97,4621.917,4622.751,Yes.,149,,
732,0.97,4622.751,4627.756,I understood Councilmember Sawant wants to also co-sponsor this bill so she's not here today.,149,,
733,0.97,4627.756,4632.761,"So if that's possible, I'd like to add her, please.",149,,
734,0.97,4632.761,4633.028,Thank you.,149,,
735,0.97,4633.028,4635.697,Is there an opportunity to join you?,150,,
736,0.97,4635.697,4637.032,Sorry if that's out of order.,150,,
737,0.97,4637.032,4645.207,It is not out of order because we're addressing the issues related to additional co-sponsors for the record.,151,,
738,0.97,4645.207,4658.487,"Councilmember Strauss, Councilmember Sawant will both be added as co-sponsors for purposes of the legislative record.",151,,
739,0.97,4658.487,4662.891,"Madam clerk, is there anything else you need on that front?",151,,
740,0.97,4662.891,4663.892,No.,152,,
741,0.97,4663.892,4664.159,Thank you.,152,,

762,0.97,4696.825,4698.093,"Thank you, Madam clerk.",169,,
763,0.97,4698.093,4700.429,The bill passes and the chair will sign it.,169,,

765,0.97,4704.199,4705.133,Agenda item 3.,169,,
766,0.97,4705.133,4710.038,Will the clerk please read agenda item 3 into the record.,169,,
767,0.97,4710.038,4714.509,Agenda item 3.,170,,
768,0.97,4714.509,4715.01,Resolution 31963.,170,,
769,0.97,4715.01,4719.381,Supporting the George Floyd justice in policing act of 2020.,170,,
770,0.97,4719.381,4720.716,"Thank you, Madam clerk.",171,,
771,0.97,4720.716,4724.653,I move to adopt resolution 31963.,171,,
772,0.97,4724.653,4726.254,Is there a second?,171,,
773,0.97,4726.254,4726.621,Second.,172,,
774,0.97,4726.621,4731.86,It's been moved and Seconded to adopt the resolution.,173,,
775,0.97,4731.86,4736.098,"Councilmember Pedersen, you are the sponsor of the resolution and are recognized in order to address this item.",173,,
776,0.97,4736.098,4739.434,"Thank you, Council President.",174,,
777,0.97,4739.434,4749.845,So resolution 31963 simply voices our support for the important national effort to pass the George Floyd justice in policing act.,174,,
778,0.97,4749.845,4760.856,"That's Federal bill Hr7120, introduced by Congressman Karen Bass, Democrat from California, and supported by Seattle's congressional delegation Jayapal and Adam Smith.",174,,
779,0.97,4760.856,4766.561,If it passed that U.S. House of Representatives but has yet to advance in the U.S. Senate.,174,,
780,0.97,4766.561,4779.241,This Federal bill addresses many concerns raised by protesters that are authorized by Federal law such as the need to restrict qualified immunity for police officers across the nation.,174,,
781,0.97,4779.241,4788.016,"Resolution 31963, which URGES immediate passage of Hr7120 by the U.S. Senate, was reviewed by our office of Intergovernmental relations.",174,,
782,0.97,4788.016,4794.389,I'd like to thank Malik Davis on my staff and Dan on central staff for working on this resolution for us.,174,,
783,0.97,4794.389,4794.689,Thank you.,174,,
784,0.97,4794.689,4797.192,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",175,,
785,0.97,4797.192,4801.963,Both for those remarks and bringing this resolution forward for our consideration.,175,,
786,0.97,4801.963,4807.903,Are there any comments on the resolution?,175,,
787,0.97,4807.903,4818.947,"Hearing no comments on the resolution, I once again want to thank you, Councilmember Pedersen, and your office, for bringing forward this important resolution.",175,,
788,0.97,4818.947,4828.59,Of course there was a caller who mentioned that perhaps it wouldn't be wise to vote on this resolution since it's calling for Federal action.,175,,
789,0.97,4828.59,4864.492,"But I definitely do support that we need to have action at all levels of government to address the significance of the policing issues being highlighted in this moment of racial reckoning across the nation and while there are certain things that we can certainly act on here locally, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be requesting and coordinating with our Federal delegation to take legislative action at the Federal level to also improve the system of policing for all Americans, including those that are here in Seattle.",175,,
790,0.97,4864.492,4869.898,So appreciate your effort on this resolution and look forward to voting in support of it.,175,,
791,0.97,4869.898,4870.298,"Okay, colleagues.",175,,
792,0.97,4870.298,4877.205,Looks like no one else has any questions or comments so we'll go ahead and ask the clerk to call the roll on the adoption of the resolution.,175,,
793,0.97,4877.205,4894.356,[roll call] seven in favor.,176,,
794,0.97,4896.625,4898.526,None opposed.,176,,
795,0.97,4898.526,4899.728,Thank you so much.,177,,
796,0.97,4899.728,4901.83,The resolution is adopted and the chair will sign it.,177,,
797,0.97,4901.83,4907.636,Will the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation on my behalf.,177,,
798,0.97,4907.636,4908.603,Agenda item 4.,177,,
799,0.97,4908.603,4912.073,Will the clerk please read item 4 into the record.,177,,
800,0.97,4912.073,4915.911,Agenda item 4.,178,,
801,0.97,4915.911,4916.945,Council bill 119742.,178,,
802,0.97,4916.945,4929.357,"Vacating portions of the alleys in block 3, Norris addition to West Seattle, in the West Eattle junction and Acceptia property use and development agreement on the petition of the Whitaker, a condominium Association, a Washington nonprofit corporation.",178,,
803,0.97,4929.357,4931.359,"Thank you, Madam clerk.",179,,
804,0.97,4931.359,4934.329,I move to pass Council bill 119742.,179,,
805,0.97,4934.329,4935.33,Is there a second?,179,,
806,0.97,4935.33,4935.764,Second.,180,,
807,0.97,4935.764,4939.901,It's been moved and Seconded to pass the bill.,181,,
808,0.97,4939.901,4944.172,"Councilmember Pedersen, you're the sponsor of the bill and are recognized in order to address this item.",181,,
809,0.97,4944.172,4949.577,"Thank you, Council President.",182,,
810,0.97,4949.577,4957.452,Council bill 119742 would finalize the location of an alley already approved for a mixed use project in West Seattle.,182,,
811,0.97,4957.452,4960.889,It's been built on Southwest Alaska Street and Fauntleroy way.,182,,
812,0.97,4960.889,4976.171,The item was heard on the transportation utilities Committee in March and Sdot and central staff confirmed all conditions included in the state vacation approval have been met.,182,,
813,0.97,4976.171,4977.205,That's all.,182,,
814,0.97,4977.205,4983.211,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Pedersen.",183,,
815,0.97,4983.211,4987.449,Are there any questions or comments on this bill?,183,,
816,0.97,4987.449,4988.416,Councilmember Herbold.,183,,
817,0.97,4988.416,4992.02,"Boy, March 4TH, so long ago we heard this.",184,,
818,0.97,4992.02,5018.68,"I, for the public record, want to clarify that we did have some question during the committee about whether or not the project met guidelines and best practices when it came to a right hand turn only out of the alley on to Fauntleroy and these conditions were related to the agreement for the street vacation.",184,,
819,0.97,5018.68,5037.532,"The concern was that there was no sign stating that the right hand turn only, said there was an arrow on the roadway in double yellow lines which are of course illegal to cross on Fauntleroy.",184,,
820,0.97,5037.532,5051.046,"After Committee, staff reviewed this and followed up and found that the street improvement permit for the Whitaker and the project as built does comply with the city's permits as was mentioned.",184,,
821,0.97,5051.046,5066.194,"A double yellow line is a standard engineering approach to addressing left hand turns on to two-way streets from driveways and alleys, understand there was some expectation there'd be a sign.",184,,
822,0.97,5066.194,5076.337,But the Council's approval of the vacation did not dictate an approach to this and left it up to the engineers and Sdot determined the best way to address the issue.,184,,
823,0.97,5076.337,5104.099,"There was another issue that was raised during the committee discussion and that relates specifically to the Signage on the building itself on the northeast corner and that the final recommendations from the design review boards stated that the Signage plan did not allow the use of a Backlit plastic barrier--I'm sorry, plastic Banner shaped signs.",184,,
824,0.97,5104.099,5108.636,"In fact, that is the type of Signage that's on the building right now.",184,,
825,0.97,5108.636,5118.513,Sdci as a result of this has an open case to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.,184,,
826,0.97,5118.513,5136.364,"This is not a requirement of the street vacation permit and although I appreciate it being brought up within the context of those deliberations, since it was not specifically part of the street improvement permit, it was a design review board recommendation.",184,,
827,0.97,5136.364,5147.075,The fact that there may be a violation does not impact my vote on approving the street vacation.,184,,
828,0.97,5147.075,5150.278,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for those comments.",185,,
829,0.97,5150.278,5150.745,Really appreciate it.,185,,
830,0.97,5150.745,5155.049,Are there any other comments on the bill?,185,,
831,0.97,5155.049,5157.752,"Hearing none, Councilmember Pedersen, anything else to add before we vote?",185,,
832,0.97,5157.752,5158.853,"No, thank you.",186,,
