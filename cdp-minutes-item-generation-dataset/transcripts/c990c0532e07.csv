41,0.97,257.49,281.347,"The county inquest process continuing this next week, which had been opposed by the city of Seattle is a small measure of accountability that our city leaders continue to ignore, because the police accountability system has deemed them lawful.",12,,

59,0.97,389.756,394.46,"And so, I'm saying, what are you going to do now?",14,,
60,0.97,394.46,404.57,"You can be on your own time clock, and some wave will come through here and you say, what just hit?",14,,

63,0.97,413.613,435.168,"But in all essence, I'm saying what is not working is what you're doing illegally, because if you were doing something legal, things would change and that stuff where those people, you pay them off, the family off, and then you turn around, they've got to figure out whether or not the police did right or wrong.",14,,
64,0.97,435.168,436.035,That's too much drama.,14,,
65,0.97,436.035,436.669,That's too much trauma.,14,,

67,0.97,441.007,449.782,"And I'm almost certain that tempers are flaring, because you know, how are you going to be calm in something like that?",14,,

101,0.97,696.328,721.887,"I think as our city moves forwards to the point of a new chief, the voice of the CPC and the community voice it supports will be essential in shaping the future of the Department and trying to create a city that safe for all, regardless of housing which does not seem to be at all times.",22,,
102,0.97,721.887,735.735,"I would take a moment to acknowledge the family of Lyles, as they go through a difficult experience of the inquest, and once more, thank you to all who have recommended my appointment.",22,,

141,0.97,907.673,910.309,"So start with introductions, please.",41,,
142,0.97,910.309,917.75,"Dan Nolte, Mayor's office.",42,,
143,0.97,917.75,958.691,"I really appreciate your willingness to appear before committee to present on the process that the Mayor's office is engaging in, together with an interdepartmental team of Stakeholders, including the Council, potentially in the hopefully near future, if it hasn't already started, including some external Stakeholders if I remember correctly, and how that process is going to be informed by the 911 call Noel Sis that was completed last year, that I know we're doing a risk assessment on those findings.",43,,
144,0.97,958.691,962.861,"So there's a lot of interest in the community, in this issue.",43,,
145,0.97,962.861,967.8,There's a lot of interest on this Council in this issue.,43,,
146,0.97,967.8,1004.703,"And I think the urgency around this is driven not just by wanting to make sure that the likelihood of harm is reduced by insuring that the appropriate Responder is responding to calls for help, but we also want to ensure that with a reduced number of officers in our police force, that we're maximizing their staff time and not sending them to calls that they don't need to respond to, so they can respond to calls that only they need to respond to.",43,,
147,0.97,1004.703,1011.176,"I think there's a lot of urgency around this work, and I really appreciate this administration's willingness to push forward.",43,,
148,0.97,1011.176,1014.046,"With that, we'll pass it on, back over to you.",43,,
149,0.97,1014.046,1014.413,Absolutely.,44,,
150,0.97,1014.413,1014.847,Thank you so much.,44,,
151,0.97,1014.847,1017.95,I think we share a lot of the same goals and visions.,44,,
152,0.97,1017.95,1021.72,"So first, I just want to thank you all, Councilmembers.",44,,
153,0.97,1021.72,1028.327,I really appreciate you allowing us to join you today.,44,,
154,0.97,1028.327,1037.202,I think that Councilmember Herbold has spoken a little to why we are interested in a diversity of call responses that come into the 911 call center.,44,,
155,0.97,1037.202,1048.714,"We do recognize that we do not currently have the resources, particularly up for a city of our size, to be able to respond to all of those calls with the same blanket response.",44,,
156,0.97,1048.714,1055.554,"And also, even if we did have those resources, it's not the smartest way for us to go about all of those calls.",44,,
157,0.97,1055.554,1061.193,We know that some of those calls don't need as high of touch.,44,,
158,0.97,1061.193,1065.998,And I'll talk a little briefly about the difference between priority calls.,44,,
159,0.97,1065.998,1087.686,"I know that you all know this, but I know there are people who are newly watching us, who don't all know these things, so forgive me if I repeat of knowledge, for our viewing audience, there might be some things we can help them better understand when we use language as well.",44,,
160,0.97,1087.686,1098.697,"But we also know that despite our resource constraints, there are different situations in which we could just better utilize our resources by having other options available to us.",44,,
161,0.97,1098.697,1111.376,"Right now, we have law enforcement that is able to, and Prioritize responding to what they consider priority one, and priority two calls.",44,,
162,0.97,1111.376,1117.649,Priority three and four calls are responded to on an as available basis.,44,,
163,0.97,1117.649,1131.13,"So let me just jump quickly into defining those four types of calls so that, you know, when I say priority one or priority two calls, everyone has an understanding for that.",44,,
164,0.97,1131.13,1133.966,So priority one calls are Life- threatening events.,44,,
165,0.97,1133.966,1135.3,Major crimes in progress.,44,,
166,0.97,1135.3,1138.737,Immediate help for firefighters or police officers.,44,,
167,0.97,1138.737,1141.406,Those are classified as priority one calls.,44,,
168,0.97,1141.406,1145.144,Priority two calls are where there are threats of violence.,44,,
169,0.97,1145.144,1158.023,"It might not be something that is currently in progress, but there's the threat, and there's a strong threat of violence, escalation, major property damage.",44,,

171,0.97,1164.596,1174.973,"So really, if you think of, it's not the threat happening, but there is somewhat of an imminent threat in the cases of priority two calls.",44,,
172,0.97,1174.973,1187.553,"Priority three calls are those where there's investigations, or minor incidents that are occurring, but where the response time isn't necessarily critical.",44,,
173,0.97,1187.553,1192.991,"So that might be a call where a burglary has occurred, but the threat is no longer currently there.",44,,
174,0.97,1192.991,1213.011,"They need to get to the calls, take the reports, but they wouldn't be preventing a crime, you know, so there might be a little more time in being able to respond to that particular call.",44,,
175,0.97,1213.011,1217.249,"A priority four call is described as a nuisance, or mischief event.",44,,
176,0.97,1217.249,1228.293,"Those are also not time sensitive, but it may be graffiti, or something that is not immediately time sensitive.",44,,
177,0.97,1228.293,1235.5,"The reports still need to be taken, but the response can be delayed, and still be just as effective.",44,,
178,0.97,1235.5,1246.111,"So when we talk about priority one, two, three, four calls, that's really what we're referring to around those priority calls.",44,,
179,0.97,1246.111,1255.02,"So with our limited resources, our officers have been Prioritizing responding to priority one and priority two calls.",44,,
180,0.97,1255.02,1261.293,"Those are the calls that there is an immediate, there is an immediate need for a response.",44,,
181,0.97,1261.293,1270.569,"The priority three, and priority four calls get taken, but they may be responded to on as an available basis.",44,,
182,0.97,1270.569,1279.144,"Sometime those as available basis calls, some people complain that there's a longer period of time in responding to those calls.",44,,
183,0.97,1279.144,1285.751,"Particularly, if someone thinks about something that might be new graffiti on a private property.",44,,
184,0.97,1285.751,1298.764,"That would be considered a priority four call, and that call might not be responded to, for maybe even a day or two, where our officers go, they take a picture, they document the report.",44,,
185,0.97,1298.764,1303.702,"But they know that those aren't as time sensitive, or urgent.",44,,
186,0.97,1303.702,1314.846,"So as we're talking about the 911 responses, and justifiably so, it is what calls actually do officers need to take.",44,,
187,0.97,1314.846,1325.223,"So something like a graffiti call might be one in which you don't need an officer response to take the picture document, and do that work.",44,,
188,0.97,1325.223,1347.145,"You will still need some certification on the report, but you don't necessarily need an officer to respond to that particular call, so when you talk about Prioritization of calls, we're really talking about which of those calls that come in need an officer or a firefighter response.",44,,
189,0.97,1347.145,1354.486,And so that takes us right into the risk managed demand analysis.,44,,
190,0.97,1354.486,1354.753,Go ahead.,44,,
191,0.97,1354.753,1355.954,Thank you.,45,,
192,0.97,1355.954,1358.123,I just want to make two points.,45,,
193,0.97,1358.123,1393.225,"One, I want to underscore that one of the things that we learned in a recent presentation on response times that the city has shifted from a policy of going into priority call status handling, where, when they're in priority call status handling mode, almost no three and four priority calls get answered, that's a decision that's made at the dispatch level.",45,,
194,0.97,1393.225,1404.569,"The new approach as I understand it allows for a Z classification, or disposition, but those decisions are made by the sergeants.",45,,
195,0.97,1404.569,1413.745,"So in my mind, that's a better approach, because at least you're having somebody on the ground with law enforcement expertise making that decision.",45,,
196,0.97,1413.745,1427.793,"It also responds, as I understand it, to an OPA recommendation for more oversight on the practice of allowing priority three calls to seven resolve.",45,,
197,0.97,1427.793,1441.773,"So I do think that's a better approach and just want to clarify for the public, because we've received a lot of Emails about this.",45,,
198,0.97,1441.773,1442.507,That's the one point.,45,,
199,0.97,1442.507,1470.101,"The other point is the fact that we're in priority call handling status for something like 230 days last year, and around the same number of days in 2020, and that we have this position process, that's part of why, I think we're frustrated by the demand management approach that we're using, because those decisions are already being made.",45,,
200,0.97,1470.101,1473.638,To not send police to respond to those lower priority calls.,45,,
201,0.97,1473.638,1479.211,"I just want to kind of create some context, again for our desire for urgency.",45,,
202,0.97,1479.211,1482.514,We want to make these decisions in the right way.,45,,
203,0.97,1482.514,1482.814,Absolutely.,45,,
204,0.97,1482.814,1489.521,But we have already been making them the last two years to a certain extent.,45,,
205,0.97,1489.521,1491.723,"Yeah, thank you for clarifying some of that.",46,,
206,0.97,1491.723,1493.959,We agree.,46,,
207,0.97,1493.959,1495.894,There have been adjustments that have been made.,46,,
208,0.97,1495.894,1512.31,"So some of this is a little bit rear facing, because those adjustments around the priority calls have already been, have already been made in order to ensure that we're responding to priority one, and priority two calls.",46,,
209,0.97,1512.31,1526.892,"And we have already begun looking at, and thinking about how we respond to priority three and priority four calls, because you don't necessarily need, you needed ability to be able to document the incidents, write good reports.",46,,
210,0.97,1526.892,1531.129,"Those reports again, may still need to be certified by law enforcement.",46,,
211,0.97,1531.129,1544.042,"But those reports can be written, and then reviewed by a law enforcement officer at the precinct, and signed and certified in that way, without having them to go out and physically look at each scene.",46,,
212,0.97,1544.042,1547.479,I appreciate that.,47,,
213,0.97,1547.479,1553.318,"Councilmember Nelson, and Councilmember Lewis.",47,,
214,0.97,1553.318,1553.451,,48,,
215,0.97,1553.451,1554.953,Thank you very much.,49,,
216,0.97,1554.953,1568.567,"I think we're getting off track here, but I don't know that I would diagnose the way the 911 system is an improvement.",49,,
217,0.97,1568.567,1590.889,"In the old system, my understanding is that when calls that came in that were lower priority, or designated priority three and four, the dispatcher told callers a response was likely to take a while, and they were given options to file Online, or call back, or call the Nonemergency line.",49,,
218,0.97,1590.889,1600.198,"But now, because the community safety and communications center is not designating calls at all, they're all being put through to the Queue.",49,,
219,0.97,1600.198,1610.942,"And a supervisor Sergeant is doing the triage at a later point, and dispatching to those high priority calls.",49,,
220,0.97,1610.942,1627.892,"But not getting back to the people who, to all callers, so they're left with no communication and you know, they're not given options, then those calls hang around in the Queue for a long time.",49,,
221,0.97,1627.892,1633.298,"I do agree that we need to talk about this much more, and thank you very much for having this item today.",49,,
222,0.97,1633.298,1645.677,"But I just wanted to express that there is a customer service issue going on with the system right now, with no communication.",49,,
223,0.97,1645.677,1646.878,That's why people are getting upset.,49,,
224,0.97,1646.878,1664.396,"So I'll support that, and just say that you are correct that they used to get more of a Timeframe from the dispatcher as to when they would be responded to, and that is something that you're right, from a customer service perspective, they should be given that information.",50,,
225,0.97,1664.396,1676.975,"There's a little bit of, you know, we're working out the transition period from having the call center located in SPD to being its own Department.",50,,
226,0.97,1676.975,1687.185,"So where that communication takes place, and how quickly that communication takes place is definitely a system I improvement, and well received.",50,,
227,0.97,1687.185,1688.887,Councilmember Lewis.,51,,
228,0.97,1688.887,1690.121,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",52,,
229,0.97,1690.121,1696.628,"This might be better for later in the presentation, but you know, I want to focus more on welfare responses.",52,,
230,0.97,1696.628,1710.942,"So I think I'll maybe get some of my questions like Admin and law enforcement discussions out of the way now, which is kind of what we're discussing.",52,,
231,0.97,1710.942,1729.227,"In terms of tier three and four calls, I think there's a lot of potential, given some of our practices and given some of the expertise of some of the other folks currently in the city family to take on more of those responsibilities.",52,,
232,0.97,1729.227,1759.791,"I can think particularly of parking enforcement officers being appropriate responders to document and write reports on car Prowls after the fact, where it's really an element of doing a report, taking pictures of the damage of the vehicle, talking to witnesses, to get statements of what was missing, and then forward that report on for consideration of the city attorney given that there's no danger in that situation.",52,,
233,0.97,1759.791,1776.508,"I also think that things like other similarly situated Misdemeanors like package thefts could be investigated by CSO's, were sort of Similarly, it's about surveillance footage, writing a report.",52,,
234,0.97,1776.508,1789.187,One step I would encourage the executive to consider is looking at our retail theft program as a possibility for an additional level of supports.,52,,
235,0.97,1789.187,1805.236,"We currently have a system where one detective aggravates all the loss prevention reports, and I see Dan Nolte nodding.",52,,
236,0.97,1805.236,1807.205,I know he's well aware of this.,52,,
237,0.97,1807.205,1818.183,"They're employees of private retailers, write the reports for the police that then go through a police detective who in turn sign it is, putting their certification on it, after reviewing the sufficiency.",52,,
238,0.97,1818.183,1848.279,"You could have a system where the sworn personnel who oversee the CSO's are the officer who would affix the certification through a similar arrangement for doing that body of report, so you're Bogging down one sworn personnel member, but empowering, you know, 40 CSO's to be able to do the work and respond.",52,,
239,0.97,1848.279,1852.183,This is just a request for central staff I don't need an answer for now.,52,,
240,0.97,1852.183,1891.189,"But I would like a report back on how we're looking on community service officer recruitment, because I think the potential of expanding that workforce, if they can take on more of the administrative priority three and priority four calls, particularly ones that are after the fact, and if we are having a successful time recruiting for this year, given the money that the Council has provided for the recruitment of CSO's, that that would just, I haven't had a report back on that in a while, so I'm just flagging an interest in that, but I don't need a response ton that now.",52,,
241,0.97,1891.189,1917.882,"But otherwise, I would encourage looking at CSO's, and PEO's for some of those tier three and tier four calls, and looking at a potential model to do that without any current restrictions and in keeping with best practices of making sure a sworn officer can put their stamp of approval on a report.",52,,
242,0.97,1917.882,1918.783,Appreciate that.,53,,
243,0.97,1918.783,1929.327,"We are working to see which, which functions and features within SPD can be moved to civilian activities.",53,,
244,0.97,1929.327,1937.669,And so we will definitely take that into account.,53,,
245,0.97,1937.669,1938.569,All right.,53,,
246,0.97,1938.569,1942.674,"I know that we are, keeping honest on time.",53,,
247,0.97,1942.674,1961.192,But let's--we'll go into just a little bit about the risk manage demand analysis and I don't know if this is a good opportunity to show the screen.,53,,
248,0.97,1961.192,1975.073,So as we've been talking about identifying some of the options for 911 dispatch other than just going directly to law enforcement and fire.,53,,
249,0.97,1975.073,1989.22,"So specifically speaking towards the, I am going to be kind of deliberately not talking about the fire enforcement part of this right now, so we're just going to be talking about the law enforcement response.",53,,
250,0.97,1989.22,2004.235,"But as you all know, SPD is working on a, we can go to the next slide, it's working on a risk manage demand analysis.",53,,
251,0.97,2004.235,2018.316,"And just for those kind of watching, this will help us to determine which calls can be responded to with resources other than a sworn officer response.",53,,
252,0.97,2018.316,2030.328,"So looking at the 911 calls that come in, what is the consequence of not having an armed response, a sworn response?",53,,
253,0.97,2030.328,2037.835,And what is the likelihood that there would be a bad outcome without a sworn response?,53,,
254,0.97,2037.835,2041.305,Each of the response is categorized based on this matrix.,53,,
255,0.97,2041.305,2049.08,Those items that are in red would clearly go to an SPD officer for a response.,53,,
256,0.97,2049.08,2058.389,"Those items that may be in green, they would then go to an alternative response, potentially CSO's, or some other form of response.",53,,
257,0.97,2058.389,2071.569,"Then of course we begin to work out between the Orange and yellow areas, what is the most appropriate triage of responses in those areas.",53,,
258,0.97,2071.569,2074.839,They may not always be just a sworn response.,53,,
259,0.97,2074.839,2087.151,"This is where we'll get into what are some of those areas in the Orange and yellow that require an immediate response, but maybe a sworn response isn't the most ideal response.",53,,
260,0.97,2087.151,2089.187,We'll talk about it a little later.,53,,
261,0.97,2089.187,2117.715,"But this is one of the concepts that the Mayor's office has been working on, called the third Department, where there might be another critical response that's not necessarily a sworn response, which is our best option, and that would be another option that we're hoping to have available to 911 with resources available, white paper about how that Department would be described and put together by the end of this year.",53,,
262,0.97,2117.715,2118.583,Any kind of questions?,53,,
263,0.97,2118.583,2126.324,"I know we are also waiting for the Rmd report, so as soon as it is available, we will take a look at it.",53,,
264,0.97,2126.324,2135.733,"We will make sure that the data looks, you know, all of our questions are answered through that, and by that.",53,,
265,0.97,2135.733,2141.873,"And as soon as we've kind of verified that aspect of it, we won't hold onto it too much longer.",53,,
266,0.97,2141.873,2152.85,"But as soon as we've verified the aspects of it, we won't have it yet, but when we get it, and verify it, we will send it to Council pretty quickly.",53,,
267,0.97,2152.85,2153.651,Thank you.,54,,
268,0.97,2153.651,2163.961,"I just wanted to flag, because you did mention the third public safety Department.",54,,
269,0.97,2163.961,2165.096,I want to flag that.,54,,
270,0.97,2165.096,2189.32,"Code 3.15.060 defines the community safety and communications center as community safety and communications center to provide timely, accurate vital information to the city's first responders, and to the public, and to provide civilian and community based services and solutions to community safety challenges.",54,,
271,0.97,2189.32,2197.695,So just again I want to flag that when the Council created this Department it was with that vision.,54,,
272,0.97,2197.695,2203.467,It was originally proposed as just a communications center.,54,,
273,0.97,2203.467,2213.477,"And we broadened Deliberatively broadened the focus, so that it could House these functions.",54,,
274,0.97,2213.477,2219.383,"Also, just, is this all we're doing on the risk manage analysis?",54,,
275,0.97,2219.383,2219.817,Or demand analysis?,54,,
276,0.97,2219.817,2224.388,"Yeah, this is just what we're talking about right now.",55,,
277,0.97,2224.388,2233.864,"So, can you just give us some sense of the Timeline for that work product?",56,,
278,0.97,2233.864,2240.671,I know we have a Q2 report.,56,,
279,0.97,2240.671,2246.11,But there's been some changes in the subject matter of the reports moving forward.,56,,
280,0.97,2246.11,2252.516,Our first quarterly report did not contain what we expected it to contain so I think we're a little bit behind.,56,,
281,0.97,2252.516,2261.859,"So I want to get a sense of when we're going to get the report, and what we can expect it to contain.",56,,
282,0.97,2261.859,2267.198,We are anticipating the Rmd report any day now.,57,,
283,0.97,2267.198,2274.672,"We have on our Timeline, we are basing on getting this in July, which of course is next week.",57,,
284,0.97,2274.672,2275.606,Beginning next week.,57,,
285,0.97,2275.606,2282.146,"And being able to evaluate that data, look it over, and then hopefully have that to Council by August.",57,,
286,0.97,2282.146,2288.352,Can you just talk a little about the interdepartmental team?,58,,
287,0.97,2288.352,2294.525,"What its structure is, what the opportunities are for Council collaboration?",58,,
288,0.97,2294.525,2295.426,What its role in?,58,,
289,0.97,2295.426,2299.463,Then we also talked about an external review of the analysis as well.,58,,
290,0.97,2299.463,2302.333,I'll talk about the Idt.,59,,
291,0.97,2302.333,2310.775,"The internal Idt first, and I try not to use too many Acronyms because I know people are watching us.",59,,
292,0.97,2310.775,2312.81,Interdepartmental teams.,59,,
293,0.97,2312.81,2318.816,Then talk a little about the public response in the next slide.,59,,
294,0.97,2318.816,2330.695,"So we have been working with central staff really closely, and we'll be working with Council to make sure that the things that we're looking at in the data, and knowledge is also shared with you.",59,,
295,0.97,2330.695,2337.101,"I think that Asha, and Greg, I know that they're somewhere on the screen behind there.",59,,
296,0.97,2337.101,2340.905,We're been working very closely with the central staff team.,59,,
297,0.97,2340.905,2346.21,The Mayor's office team has been working very closely.,59,,
298,0.97,2346.21,2363.928,"And if we'll go to the next slide we will take this information and data that we have to also work with our folks from community, our Stakeholders and community in behavioral health crisis response.",59,,
299,0.97,2363.928,2371.001,And other community groups with expertise to help us look at the data.,59,,
300,0.97,2371.001,2380.911,Also to help to gauge their input around what we're seeing and around what they may be seeing.,59,,
301,0.97,2380.911,2394.692,We have currently started interviewing a number of different community Stakeholder groups doing some One-On-One interviews with community Stakeholder groups to gauge and gather their input around public safety in general.,59,,
302,0.97,2394.692,2413.244,"And we will be in the reports that we produce, you will see the Interviewses that we have conducted with dates and times of those that we have conducted interviews with, to inform some of the direction that we'll be taking.",59,,
303,0.97,2413.244,2429.927,"All of that data will be made available to Council, and we'll be working with Council staff closely if there's information that we can supplement in data.",59,,
304,0.97,2429.927,2432.763,"Thank you, Madam chair.",60,,
305,0.97,2432.763,2456.287,"Just as a Foundational question on this slide talking about the process, I've asked this question before in private, and in open sessions about the extent to which our process is informed by the process other cities have used to set up alternative responses.",60,,
306,0.97,2456.287,2476.874,"Part of the reason, you know, why like Ideally, the executive to look to some of these other cities is it just seems from reviewing them that other cities have been able to move much more swiftly and efficiently to stand up some of these alternatives.",60,,
307,0.97,2476.874,2489.887,"When I look at how comprehensive this process is, I think this could be great for us to be in the position to do something revolutionary that goes above and beyond what some other jurisdictions have done.",60,,
308,0.97,2489.887,2503.968,"I also worry that it puts us in the position of deferring low hanging fruit, that those can be taken on by other services.",60,,
309,0.97,2503.968,2514.712,"I speak in particular about welfare calls, which a number of jurisdictions have unloaded to other responders with no issue, or consequence.",60,,
310,0.97,2514.712,2522.653,But at massive benefit to the utility of their police services to focus on things that are criminal in nature.,60,,
311,0.97,2522.653,2540.404,"And I just want to make sure that we don't get so bogged down in the process that we defer for a year or two years or three years on getting something out into the street, given that we're sort of building an airplane as we fly it, right?",60,,
312,0.97,2540.404,2546.143,"Crime, disorder, public health issues don't wait for us to finish our process and develop a response.",60,,
313,0.97,2546.143,2549.647,"In a major city, it's ongoing, and it's happening.",60,,
314,0.97,2549.647,2564.428,"And if we can triage to a certain extent to roll out certain responses as we build towards some of those bigger ones, I think that would be something I would be more favorably disposed to.",60,,
315,0.97,2564.428,2571.068,"So I just want to make sure that we don't kind of wait to go from 0 to 40,000 calls.",60,,
316,0.97,2571.068,2580.311,"But if we can carve off 5,000 call as year for a service we all agree on, that we can take advantage of that, instead of waiting.",60,,
317,0.97,2580.311,2597.962,"Just, if I could make an underscore, not make a final point, he made a very fine point, but underscore, we've all had conversations about how we can consider alternatives on a shorter Timeline than the full call analysis.",61,,
318,0.97,2597.962,2627.157,"We've had conversations about which calls might be considered of the 100 or so call types that are being analyzed under this system, and I'm just hoping that you can share with us the executives thoughts around which call types could be expedited as a, you know, a pilot, or a carve out of a larger body of work that would wait on that larger call analysis.",61,,
319,0.97,2627.157,2632.563,"What we can do sooner, rather than later.",61,,
320,0.97,2632.563,2634.932,Chair Herbold --,62,,
321,0.97,2634.932,2638.168,If you can wait just--thank you.,63,,
322,0.97,2638.168,2648.879,I'll speak to Councilmember Lewis's question then I'll defer to this Uw Mayor.,64,,
323,0.97,2648.879,2662.092,"Councilmember Lewis we've talked about this significantly, we do believe there's significant merit in evaluating what's going on in other districts, between Eugene, Albuquerque, and Minneapolis, there's a lot of Innovating things happening.",64,,
324,0.97,2662.092,2670.801,As part of our ongoing work we have done a significant amount of research into those jurisdictions.,64,,
325,0.97,2670.801,2672.169,What do they do?,64,,
326,0.97,2672.169,2680.31,"Is it Scalable, and would it work in Seattle, and the answer to some of them is yes.",64,,
327,0.97,2680.31,2690.621,"I think we're committed to combining our notes with central Straff and working Collaboratively with them, to understand these programs, to make sure, yes it is something that we could Pivot.",64,,
328,0.97,2690.621,2702.699,"But I want to be clear, that work is ongoing, we're very much looking into these programs, and we hear you loud and clear of the need to consider Pivots sooner rather than later.",64,,
329,0.97,2702.699,2713.744,"So I'll talk a little about, obviously health one is referring, is answering some of these calls right now.",65,,
330,0.97,2713.744,2721.552,"There are options to expand health one as we move forward, and just trying to be really deliberate about how we're doing some of these responses.",65,,
331,0.97,2721.552,2726.89,"Some of these responses are coming, because we don't have the resources right now, and we're having to innovate in the moment.",65,,
332,0.97,2726.89,2738.302,"I think a lot of what we're doing in terms of alternate responses are in practice, and it's just how do we solidify those?",65,,
333,0.97,2738.302,2743.24,"Not just for a band aid patch at the moment, but how do we set them up for long term success?",65,,
334,0.97,2743.24,2751.148,So we do have a pretty unique situation with some of Seattle in that we have more limited staff.,65,,
335,0.97,2751.148,2753.083,We have 84 square miles.,65,,
336,0.97,2753.083,2762.493,"We have a pretty interesting geography in people's ability to respond, when we have smaller staff teams, I will give CSO's, as an example.",65,,
337,0.97,2762.493,2779.81,"If we have them covering seven days a week, you know, 24 hours a day, and 84 square miles, there isn't a lot that we can dispatch formerly from 911, that all people across the city could expect the same service and delivery.",65,,
338,0.97,2779.81,2786.817,"So some of the things that could be shifted immediately, we just don't have the human resource to shift immediately.",65,,
339,0.97,2786.817,2799.062,"As we think about what that structure is, we can build for both our geography as well as the personnel that would be needed for these things.",65,,
340,0.97,2799.062,2800.03,Councilmember Nelson.,65,,
341,0.97,2800.03,2807.137,What was the number of that Council bill you mentioned that established the Cscc?,66,,
342,0.97,2807.137,2808.338,I didn't catch it.,66,,
343,0.97,2808.338,2820.217,"I didn't mention the Council bill, I mentioned the location of the municipal code.",67,,
344,0.97,2820.217,2820.584,3.5.06 South.,67,,
345,0.97,2820.584,2822.019,Councilmember Lewis.,68,,
346,0.97,2822.019,2827.157,Deputy Player I appreciate that response on particularly health one.,69,,
347,0.97,2827.157,2841.238,"Just to take a step backwards though on health one, and I think this is important, because as we reconcile our current responses and current bureaucracies, I think it's important to point out what any new service, what niche it would fill.",69,,
348,0.97,2841.238,2847.044,"I think a helpful way to think about it, and I'd like T.O.",69,,
349,0.97,2847.044,2849.746,Talk to the executive about this.,69,,
350,0.97,2849.746,2860.958,"I've talked a lot, and I know the Mayor talked a lot as the candidate about the Eugene program, and there's a lot of derivative programs like cahoots in other cities.",69,,
351,0.97,2860.958,2868.932,"Health one is to fire ladder companies what cahoots is to the police, is the best framework to think about it.",69,,
352,0.97,2868.932,2889.253,"Health one, from my understanding was conceived as a way to not have to dispatch a full ladder company for something that could easily be dealt with by a more nimble and smaller team to save money, and to save the efficiency, and effectiveness of when we dispatch firefighters.",69,,
353,0.97,2889.253,2895.926,It does not necessarily correlate in the same way to police time and service.,69,,
354,0.97,2895.926,2922.552,"I think in terms of the body of work that is missing from our current system, it is having a health one for the police service, which in my estimation, would be something like a Star program, a cahoots, or Albuquerque community safety program.",69,,
355,0.97,2922.552,2925.756,"All of which are program Atticly, pretty much the same.",69,,
356,0.97,2925.756,2931.161,I would encourage us to do a pilot for a service like that as soon as possible.,69,,
357,0.97,2931.161,2940.871,And I look forward to having that ongoing discussion.,69,,
358,0.97,2940.871,2945.208,"Just to underscore, again, Councilmember Lewis's point.",70,,
359,0.97,2945.208,2958.789,"Around this time last year in the previous administration, there was an announcement that they were ready to create a triage one person to analyze check calls.",70,,
360,0.97,2958.789,2961.625,"There was none of this, we need to analysis the risk.",70,,
361,0.97,2961.625,2976.006,"They were doing the risk analysis, but they heard us when we said we wanted to deal with some of the lower hanging fruit right now, while we're still dealing with the analysis piece.",70,,
362,0.97,2976.006,2984.715,"There was risk about alternative response, they hung up because of labor discussions.",70,,
363,0.97,2984.715,3001.064,"I recognize that we're not fully staffed up for CSO's, and there's a lot of interest to support the growth of that unit.",70,,
364,0.97,3001.064,3006.57,I believe we added six positions above and beyond to what was proposed last year.,70,,
365,0.97,3006.57,3009.773,There's 26 positions for the CSO's that are funded.,70,,
366,0.97,3009.773,3019.683,"If the capacity issue is the issue, let's work together to get the rest of those positions filled.",70,,
367,0.97,3019.683,3027.791,"But as I've discussed with you, deputy Mayor Harrell, I would like us, even while we have capacity issues, I want us to be building the system.",70,,
368,0.97,3027.791,3049.346,"So really, it's, to me it's about making sure that the dispatch system that the community safety and communications, community safety center is hiring a dispatch system, that is going to help with us.",70,,
369,0.97,3049.346,3056.153,Deputy Lombard has told me that their current system can dispatch directly to CSO's now.,70,,
370,0.97,3056.153,3072.736,"So again, we'd really like to get some movement on those two call types without waiting for this analysis while still supporting this larger body of work.",70,,
371,0.97,3072.736,3073.003,Yeah.,71,,
372,0.97,3073.003,3094.991,"I will add again that we only have 13Ish CSO's, so for the 911 center to dispatch to 13 people, seven days a week, over 84 square miles, we would not be able to--the CSO's in the way they're currently Configured, they're not waiting around for emergency calls.",71,,
373,0.97,3094.991,3105.168,"So to be Alto dispatch them from the 911 call center isn't feasible at the moment, but we are working on recruiting and response, and how that might work.",71,,
374,0.97,3105.168,3112.409,"We know that the, you know the 911 call center is able to dispatch to a number of different groups.",71,,
375,0.97,3112.409,3114.478,That system's not seeing us yet.,71,,
376,0.97,3114.478,3121.284,They're still a relatively new Department.,71,,
377,0.97,3121.284,3123.453,We're working on still finding their permanent leadership.,71,,
378,0.97,3123.453,3133.23,"So until we get to a point where with we know we can do it consistently and with good outcomes, we are being a little more cautious.",71,,
379,0.97,3133.23,3145.175,"I don't want to speak for the prior administration, but what we saw with the triage one was not nearly as far along as you might think it was.",71,,
380,0.97,3145.175,3153.517,"And so, we are looking at the system from what we have and where we were.",71,,
381,0.97,3153.517,3156.152,And I think we are making pretty good progress.,71,,
382,0.97,3156.152,3174.638,"I know it's probably frustrating for you all, going through a transition, but I think that, you know, we are working with what we have and trying to build those Sustainably as we move forward.",71,,
383,0.97,3174.638,3181.811,"I would just also add some of what we've gotten from the 911 line, so health one is a huge help, huge support from the fire Department.",71,,
384,0.97,3181.811,3189.92,So some of those are being able to be dispatched from the 911 call center.,71,,
385,0.97,3189.92,3216.546,"I would also add the addition of the nursing Hotline has actually been a tremendous calls into the 911 Hotline, and is a great service that has been set up, and helps to, for people who might not know whether they should call 911 or not, the nursing line helps to alleviate some of the pressure on that particular system.",71,,
386,0.97,3216.546,3229.292,"And as we're looking at the additional Department, we've also been doing roll call visits with our different law enforcement precincts.",71,,
387,0.97,3229.292,3249.713,"One of the things that we've heard overwhelmingly, they would like additional supports for calls that I think we know could best be handled by those with additional training and skills, our services around mental health supports for calls that would have a mental health component.",71,,
388,0.97,3249.713,3259.255,We have heard even directly from officers that supports in and around mental health would be something.,71,,
389,0.97,3259.255,3279.976,"So when we talk about the third Department per se, we are going to be looking at those calls that can be Resourced through additional mental health supports and services to complement some new investments that the state and Federal government might be willing to help us make in those areas.",71,,
390,0.97,3279.976,3281.945,Just one last point on this.,72,,
391,0.97,3281.945,3291.354,"I'm going to start just by recognizing, that I appreciate your diplomatic remarks, deputy Mayor about the previous administration.",72,,
392,0.97,3291.354,3300.897,"I just want to state that I am incredibly pleased with the responsiveness, collaboration, determination of this administration on this issue.",72,,
393,0.97,3300.897,3308.138,So I just want to make that abundantly clear.,72,,
394,0.97,3308.138,3323.253,"Us being tough on you is mostly our frustration over lack of progress in these issues that predates you, so I just want to reaffirm that, but I do want to do one more plug and we can follow up after the meeting on this.",72,,
395,0.97,3323.253,3347.911,"I think a lot of the questions, deputy Mayor that you raised regarding some of the capacity Issueses related to the communications center, and the nation of how we would integrate some new service into this, I think that those are issues that would benefit from the Scoping and development of a pilot to help to Troubleshoot through those issues.",72,,
396,0.97,3347.911,3357.454,I think a big part of this really is just starting to do the work and making a commitment.,72,,
397,0.97,3357.454,3369.232,"Central staff put together for me, because I was curious what it would cost to put together a pilot with just one Van and one team.",72,,
398,0.97,3369.232,3376.706,"It would cost somewhere between 700,000, and $1 million a year to run a pilot like that.",72,,
399,0.97,3376.706,3386.649,"That would pay for two, basically Emt, outreach worker Pier support navigator type folks, and then one supervisor.",72,,
400,0.97,3386.649,3394.257,Also a ongoing research data% ANALYTICS support to track the Metrics of the pilot to aim towards the Scalability.,72,,
401,0.97,3394.257,3404.467,"You know, I think we've seen with a lot of these programs nationally, they all start with a pilot like that, but then over the course of 12 to 16 months, they're able to scale.",72,,
402,0.97,3404.467,3409.405,I think one of the things we have not done over the last two years is just make that plunge into the pilot.,72,,
403,0.97,3409.405,3417.18,"Because the cities that did do that in 2020 have mature, well developed programs.",72,,
404,0.97,3417.18,3436.933,"I would just encourage us to look into the possibility of that 700 million, to $100 million investment for the pilot in order to start getting that in the field work that can inform the Scalability, and adaptability of a service like this.",72,,
405,0.97,3436.933,3438.301,I'm happy to follow up on that.,72,,
406,0.97,3438.301,3447.177,"I think that we're at the point in that process, where that would be an incredibly helpful next step forward.",72,,
407,0.97,3447.177,3449.145,Thank you for that.,73,,
408,0.97,3449.145,3461.758,"I assume central staff, if they haven't shared with our collaborative team, if they would share that, if they haven't already, we'll definitely take a look at that.",73,,
409,0.97,3461.758,3468.731,"This is Uncollaboratetive, right?",74,,
410,0.97,3468.731,3474.17,"Councilmember Nelson, I know you're in the Queue.",74,,
411,0.97,3474.17,3483.713,We have a discussion about--and if you can talk about counsel's participation.,74,,
412,0.97,3483.713,3486.549,Thanks Councilmember Herbold.,75,,
413,0.97,3486.549,3491.688,I will confirm that the estimate that Councilmember Lewis was talking about was shared with the executive.,75,,
414,0.97,3491.688,3497.126,"On the dispatch, I just had a quick Verifying question.",75,,
415,0.97,3497.126,3503.6,"Are health one and the nursing Hotline, are they dispatched, or are they secondary responders?",75,,
416,0.97,3503.6,3505.368,I just want to make sure.,75,,
417,0.97,3505.368,3513.643,Directly from 911. E dispatched and the nurse Hotline is a separate number.,75,,
418,0.97,3513.643,3533.897,"So if somebody calls 911, they don't get referred back to the nurse line, but we promote the nurse line as an alternative to 911, if somebody has a question pertaining to physical health that isn't considered Life- threatening, but they don't know what the next step should be.",75,,
419,0.97,3533.897,3548.811,"So if somebody calls into 911, they're not referred back to the nurse line, but we're promoting the nurse line as a means to be able to stave off some of the calls that might come in through 911.",75,,
420,0.97,3548.811,3556.92,"I don't mean to Trivialize it, but I will give you an example that more people are probably familiar with.",75,,
421,0.97,3556.92,3564.46,"Every year around Thanksgiving, 911 gets a lot of calls about how you cook a Turkey.",75,,
422,0.97,3564.46,3575.238,"So many years, so they've developed a Turkey Hotline so people can ask those questions directly to the Turkey Hotline.",75,,
423,0.97,3575.238,3584.547,"But people have questions that they may need an answer to, but it's not like somebody is in the process, like they might die at that moment.",75,,
424,0.97,3584.547,3594.991,"So the nurse Hotline, where people are in that phase, where they don't know where to go with an answer and get a response, they can go to the nurse Hotline.",75,,
425,0.97,3594.991,3612.942,"The nurse Hotline may triage with them, and say, no, you need to call 911, and connect them to an Emt, or other such service, but it gives them an ability to be able to not wait until an emergency to ask what could end up being a health emergency question.",75,,
426,0.97,3612.942,3616.512,I saw we can go to the next slide.,75,,
427,0.97,3616.512,3649.278,"So we've been talking around this a little bit, so we're a little bit ahead of this slide, but again, identifying the calls what some of the responses might be, how we might be able to use CSO officers for some of the calls, particularly priority two and three calls and other calls to save resources.",75,,
428,0.97,3649.278,3652.048,But that's that topic there.,75,,
429,0.97,3652.048,3667.997,Then we just wanted to give you all an update on some of the statements and legislative intent that were from earlier years.,75,,
430,0.97,3667.997,3675.972,And so I'm going to pass over to Myerberg to talk about some of these.,75,,
431,0.97,3675.972,3681.577,We have upcoming responses for all of these slides.,76,,
432,0.97,3681.577,3687.817,"I believe it's Council Pedersen, and Lewis, and Herbold with outstanding slide services.",76,,
433,0.97,3687.817,3703.9,"With regards to the CSO program, and to really put a finer point on what we've been discussing today, we have had conversations within our ongoing work, with the CSO's about what would a pivot look like, how would you do it.",76,,
434,0.97,3703.9,3706.335,What calls would you go to?,76,,
435,0.97,3706.335,3712.442,I think the senior Mayor deputy touched on it.,76,,
436,0.97,3712.442,3713.676,To what part of the work.,76,,
437,0.97,3713.676,3718.448,"Obviously, you know, we are very much looking at paper calls.",76,,
438,0.97,3718.448,3724.32,We're looking at crisis and I'll use welfare checks and persons they'll call.,76,,
439,0.97,3724.32,3727.657,But we're also looking at broader Spectrums as well.,76,,
440,0.97,3727.657,3729.792,"For example, found property.",76,,
441,0.97,3729.792,3734.764,"That's not a weapon, or not drugs.",76,,
442,0.97,3734.764,3735.331,Requests for transport.,76,,
443,0.97,3735.331,3736.299,Requests for food or shelter.,76,,
444,0.97,3736.299,3745.241,Those are types of calls that could also be shifted to CSO's and they would likely be able to take those up with minimum training.,76,,
445,0.97,3745.241,3752.148,"We will be addressing that in the slide response to you, and to reaffirm if we can move for quickly, we will.",76,,
446,0.97,3752.148,3761.924,"We are trying to be Deliberative, but we're also trying to be responsive to you all and what we hear from the community.",76,,
447,0.97,3761.924,3765.361,So the next was Councilmember Pedersen's slide that talked about calls that have --,76,,
448,0.97,3765.361,3768.598,Can I ask a question on the previous slide?,77,,
449,0.97,3768.598,3769.332,On the previous slide?,78,,
450,0.97,3769.332,3769.532,Yep.,78,,
451,0.97,3769.532,3782.278,"I wanted to go back to a question I asked of Asha at some point, I know Councilmember Asha is in the Queue.",78,,
452,0.97,3782.278,3783.746,Just one more remark.,79,,
453,0.97,3783.746,3794.323,"Councilmember Herbold and I in particular spent a lot of time with the CSO's, discussing the possibility of the scope.",79,,
454,0.97,3794.323,3807.103,"I walked away from that experience with the understanding that the culture of that unit, unless it's evolved sort of wanted to fill a role of almost like a police auxiliary sort of unit.",79,,
455,0.97,3807.103,3816.879,"They were interested in staying in SPD, some of them aspired to Úbe SP D officers.",79,,
456,0.97,3816.879,3832.395,"So I want to be really careful with all of these different units we really look at what the culture, and the role is, because I think there's a lot of utility that can come from having a police auxiliary responding to level three and level four calls.",79,,
457,0.97,3832.395,3847.777,"In our haste, because I know we've been talking about wanting to do things quickly, I would still have us be cautious in terms of what obligations we put into certain units, if it doesn't necessarily fit with the exact role they want to fill.",79,,
458,0.97,3847.777,3868.598,"So in terms of, you know, taking on kind of welfare check responses and things like that, I really want to make sure that fits with what that unit has envisioned to its culture.",79,,
459,0.97,3868.598,3874.203,I would just make sure that we're careful about how we structure it.,79,,
460,0.97,3874.203,3882.144,"But I think within that role, there's lots of things we could help them do, with the response we're facing.",79,,
461,0.97,3882.144,3886.082,I think their role is correct.,80,,
462,0.97,3886.082,3889.518,"That we need to have our vision, also incorporate the vision of that workforce.",80,,
463,0.97,3889.518,3894.09,But I will say that things have changed since last year.,80,,
464,0.97,3894.09,3905.034,"I think as it relates to some of those cultural issues that you're raising, I think there's a little bit more diversity of opinion.",80,,
465,0.97,3905.034,3905.501,Councilmember Nelson.,80,,
466,0.97,3905.501,3911.407,I said I'll wait until the end of the presentation.,81,,
467,0.97,3911.407,3911.707,Got it.,82,,
468,0.97,3911.707,3921.884,"And then after we're done going over the slides, which I know you're not done yet, do I want to return to the question I've asked of Asha.",82,,
469,0.97,3921.884,3923.719,Do you want to do that now?,83,,
470,0.97,3923.719,3928.09,We can return to the Asha question now.,83,,
471,0.97,3928.09,3935.197,"That would be get, since I think it's still much more focused on the earlier conversation.",84,,
472,0.97,3935.197,3936.732,Thanks Councilmember.,85,,
473,0.97,3936.732,3945.975,We have been talking to the Mayor's office and the deputy Mayor and to Dan about participation in the interdepartmental team looks like.,85,,
474,0.97,3945.975,3952.081,Ann and Greg were able to go to a meeting earlier this year with the working group.,85,,
475,0.97,3952.081,3980.576,"And so, the idea is for us to be able to partnership in looking at the Rnd data analysis and be a part of those conversations once the executive is ready for us to be involved so we've been sort of keeping closely in the Loop about what timing looks like, and to some extent, what the working group will actually be looking at, and how membership is currently structured, and is changing.",85,,
476,0.97,3980.576,3997.493,"Solve I defer to the deputy Mayor for any specific details about the Ibt itself, but we have been having the conversation about what it might look like for Council to be involved in those conversations, and to be able to look at the data sort of in Realtime.",85,,
477,0.97,3997.493,4012.174,"So just to make sure I understand what you're saying, Asha, you're saying you're still working on defining the role of Council to engage in this body of work?",86,,
478,0.97,4012.174,4021.984,"Yes, we are still in conversation about what that's going to look like, and what the timing looks like.",87,,
479,0.97,4021.984,4028.09,My recollection is that was part of the report last time the executive came to present.,88,,
480,0.97,4028.09,4054.216,"So again, I hope we can solidify those agreements, because they are, again, they're Foundational to, I know with have a tendency maybe sometimes to do things Sequentially, and given that perhaps you don't plan to pull together the work group until the analysis is done, maybe the thinking is we don't need to have all that worked out until the analysis is done.",88,,
481,0.97,4054.216,4061.39,"But I think some things could be done in parallel so that when it's time to go, we're ready to go.",88,,
482,0.97,4061.39,4072.601,"We know how busy schedules get, so we can set those meetings on the calendar early, even before we have the Rnd in place, we'll work on that.",89,,
483,0.97,4072.601,4093.122,"So the next slide was from Councilmember Pedersen, to look at the current response options to those calls and gaps in services, and how the city could scale up services to address those unmet needs and associated costs.",90,,
484,0.97,4093.122,4095.191,We very much agree with the intent of the slide.,90,,
485,0.97,4095.191,4101.163,"And it has been our work, and it's very Apropo to what we're going to be doing today.",90,,
486,0.97,4101.163,4107.503,"To understand more fully what they do, and I think there's a lot of opportunity to partner with them.",90,,
487,0.97,4107.503,4114.376,"And to work with systems that are already up and running, that might be able to be scaled up.",90,,
488,0.97,4114.376,4126.889,But we are continuing to evaluate this and get Councilmember Pedersen a more detailed response to the slide.,90,,
489,0.97,4126.889,4127.456,Councilmember Pedersen.,91,,
490,0.97,4127.456,4130.359,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",92,,
491,0.97,4130.359,4136.165,Our request for this Sponse to information.,92,,
492,0.97,4136.165,4138.868,I want to echo the comments of my colleagues.,92,,
493,0.97,4138.868,4153.649,"Just that I know you want to get it right the first time, and you're being methodical, and I appreciate that, and we also have a sense of urgency, since we've been trying to do something in this realm for many months.",92,,
494,0.97,4153.649,4175.037,"One of the reasons that I was interested in having the Council approve this request, which we did in November of last year, was because just to realize that there was going to be a cost, when we're trying to do two things at once, we're trying to have an appropriate police response.",92,,
495,0.97,4175.037,4193.756,"We're also trying to stand up other emergency responses for those experiencing behavioral health crises, and so costing it out is really important to just have the realization that this may require additional investments, at least initially.",92,,
496,0.97,4193.756,4230.426,"So I just want to make sure, and I appreciate your wanting to see, and to not duplicate what King County may be doing, I do want to ensure we have some level of control on the city side, that we are getting the services that it's easy for people to call 911 or 988, and get the response and they don't have to navigate a King County system much phone numbers that's only Monday through Friday 9 through 5, but that they're getting a 24/7 response.",92,,
497,0.97,4230.426,4233.929,"And if we have to contribute to that cost, then so be it.",92,,
498,0.97,4233.929,4254.817,"I know we did that with the nurse family partnership program, where it's a King County nursing program, home Visitation program, evidence based, and we wanted to provide additional services in the city, so we just supplemented that cost.",92,,
499,0.97,4254.817,4266.996,"I just want to make sure that we do get the cost estimates as well, just so we have a reality check on what we need to start investing in.",92,,
500,0.97,4266.996,4267.296,Thank you.,92,,
501,0.97,4267.296,4273.636,"We hear you loud and clear as well on the times, and the dispatch times particularly.",93,,
502,0.97,4273.636,4282.077,"You know, obviously, if we have these services, we need them to be dispatched the same, as if it's under 30 minutes, or what the Timeframe is.",93,,
503,0.97,4282.077,4292.021,"We would have to work on staffing up, buying up, and again, it's just one piece of the puzzle that we're looking at, but we appreciate the slide.",93,,
504,0.97,4292.021,4293.188,Thank you.,94,,
505,0.97,4293.188,4298.26,"The last slide that we have, do you have anything to add?",95,,
506,0.97,4298.26,4305.567,The last slide that we had was concerning triage one.,95,,
507,0.97,4305.567,4308.203,I think we've communicated this out to the group.,95,,
508,0.97,4308.203,4318.714,"At this point, the Mayor's office is not proceeding with triage one for a host of reasons, and we'll lay them out more specifically in the slide.",95,,
509,0.97,4318.714,4344.907,"And again, we, that doesn't mean that in concept, we didn't agree with some of the concepts behind it, we would again, like to be more Deliberative, and think through what a more cost effective, more practical, and a better option might be, the response that same Subset, or a variation of the sub set of costs.",95,,
510,0.97,4344.907,4354.85,I'll just add that this one wasn't as far along as I think might have been publicly communicated.,96,,
511,0.97,4354.85,4374.203,"And so, since we were kind of at the beginning phases of both this, and the work we're doing around the third Department, combining what we wanted to do with this, with a third Department at the same time, and trying to figure out how we can roll these out is the approach we have taken.",96,,
512,0.97,4374.203,4381.377,"What I will say is, if we come up with something that we can roll out sooner, we will pilot it.",96,,
513,0.97,4381.377,4383.178,We're not cautious to the point of inaction.,96,,
514,0.97,4383.178,4413.542,"But I think we are trying to be really deliberate with all of the resources that we have available to us right now, which is the combination of wanting to make sure that we're setting up systems for Sustainability, and Permanency, doesn't mean we won't try something new, but also working within the resource parameters that we have as a city right now, both in terms of person power, as well as financial and other.",96,,
515,0.97,4413.542,4419.047,So we're balancing all of those things to figure out how we step forward with each particular one.,96,,
516,0.97,4419.047,4433.996,"And in particular, when we dug into this one, there just wasn't a lot of structure there to even begin to move that forward, which is why we've combined this Pathway in with the other pathways we're taking.",96,,
517,0.97,4433.996,4447.876,"I just want to say I hope that report includes, it doesn't need to be called triage one, but the part of the earlier proposal, however far along it was, or wasn't, that I think there was a lot of support for.",97,,
518,0.97,4447.876,4453.949,"The Hangups were, as I understand it, about what workforce was going to do it.",97,,
519,0.97,4453.949,4467.796,I hope that report that slide report that you send us gives a commitment to address in something that we can pilot soon.,97,,
520,0.97,4467.796,4469.465,"The person down, and wellness calls.",97,,
521,0.97,4469.465,4471.867,"I think the plan was about 8,000 call as year.",97,,
522,0.97,4471.867,4473.368,That's a place to start.,97,,
523,0.97,4473.368,4493.388,"And that is, I think the Foundational point that every chance I have an opportunity to talk to you either, senior deputy Mayor Harrell, or you director Myerberg, have been pleading with you, that we move forward on that small Subset of calls.",97,,
524,0.97,4493.388,4497.493,"Madam chair, can I ask you a question?",98,,
525,0.97,4497.493,4520.983,"I similarly would like to echo that that sub set of calls that I was identified a year ago, I believe is in an appropriate place, where a Scoping discussion on a pilot would be a fruitful exercise between the executive and the Council, and how we might move forward in that.",98,,
526,0.97,4520.983,4527.289,"I just Rant recently read, there's a may 29th article about the process of which that plan came about.",98,,
527,0.97,4527.289,4536.965,"And it was striking to read through this article, I'm looking at it right now on the Dias for reference.",98,,
528,0.97,4536.965,4548.443,It was born out of necessity from Albuquerque's police office.,98,,
529,0.97,4548.443,4558.82,It was scoped to respond to calls that are very much along the same line of what we identified in the analysis.,98,,
530,0.97,4558.82,4562.524,Councilmember Herbold is referring to as a response for a scope alternative.,98,,
531,0.97,4562.524,4570.365,That is speaking to the Website of the Albuquerque community safety program.,98,,
532,0.97,4570.365,4590.652,"Calls that are dispatched via 911 with behavioral health nexus, community Street order, homelessness, mobile crisis team Clinicians, looking at the Denver Star's Website, and the scope that they identify, which is very similar.",98,,
533,0.97,4590.652,4603.765,"Calls that pair mental health Clinicians and Emt's, to respond to low risk and community calls to provide triage, Deescalation resource prevention.",98,,
534,0.97,4603.765,4616.778,So a lot of these programs across these different cities are responding to calls of the nature and scope that chair Herbold has identified and that we've discussed earlier in committee.,98,,
535,0.97,4616.778,4621.783,It seems all of those programs start the with the one Van pilot.,98,,
536,0.97,4621.783,4625.621,"It's a program I made several times today, to this hearing.",98,,
537,0.97,4625.621,4633.628,"I think to a certain extend, that's kind of what triage one was envisioned as, S from the previous administration.",98,,
538,0.97,4633.628,4656.084,"I agree, it's not completely clear, but in terms of Reconfiguring a pilot along the lines of what some of those other programs are, I think there's a lot of runway for us to look into that, in terms of how it relates to a third Department, I would encourage us to not wait for a third party to be created before a service like that.",98,,
539,0.97,4656.084,4668.363,"We could park it into the call center Department as we wait on how that service can be set up for that pilot, and then move it to that new Department.",98,,
540,0.97,4668.363,4671.6,But I just think it will give us a lot more clarity.,98,,
541,0.97,4671.6,4688.15,"We'll get a lot more data, and a much clearer understanding of what that response could be by going after that already identified sub set of calls.",98,,
542,0.97,4688.15,4695.557,I think this might be the end.,99,,
543,0.97,4695.557,4697.259,"Councilmember Nelson, are you ready?",99,,
544,0.97,4697.259,4699.161,Yeah.,100,,
545,0.97,4699.161,4708.503,"So I just want to clarify first, my talk about the 911 calls was not a criticism of the Harrell administration.",100,,
546,0.97,4708.503,4716.411,I realize that you've run a Department that is not evenly a year old now.,100,,
547,0.97,4716.411,4726.288,"So just I hear my colleagues impatience for an alternative response, and to fulfill the mission for that.",100,,
548,0.97,4726.288,4733.829,"And I also am looking forward myself to the third Department, and its unveiling.",100,,
549,0.97,4733.829,4736.431,My priority is getting this right.,100,,
550,0.97,4736.431,4747.809,"Because we're talking about lives here and how they're responding to and emergencies, and we need to avoid unintended consequences.",100,,
551,0.97,4747.809,4752.38,That means really paying attention to the details.,100,,
552,0.97,4752.38,4761.223,"Costing things out, understanding, you know whether or not the models in other cities would really work here in as big of a city.",100,,
553,0.97,4761.223,4763.492,"Cahoots has been around for years, and has been great.",100,,
554,0.97,4763.492,4767.429,"And handles, I think 8% of the calls in Eugene.",100,,
555,0.97,4767.429,4777.506,"We also had a similar model, which is health one here, very expensive to expand, but should be.",100,,
556,0.97,4777.506,4779.007,So I don't know.,100,,
557,0.97,4779.007,4784.479,I'm just saying that I hope that we're all on the same page here.,100,,
558,0.97,4784.479,4784.746,And some.,100,,
559,0.97,4784.746,4795.023,"Challenges that I see going forward is the very availability of social service providers, whoever they are, 24/7.",100,,
560,0.97,4795.023,4803.832,"Because we're talking about Nonprofits, and we need to figure out whether or not we can actually contract with these people to do this work 24/7.",100,,
561,0.97,4803.832,4814.142,"Another is, who is going to decide what kind of call this is coming in?",100,,
562,0.97,4814.142,4823.251,Cscc doesn't diagnose the calls immediately.,100,,
563,0.97,4823.251,4835.997,"So Anyways, very complicated and I just believe that we should proceed with Elscroby and careful deliberation.",100,,
564,0.97,4835.997,4841.036,Thank you for that.,101,,
565,0.97,4841.036,4851.413,"And trust me no criticisms were taken, you know, by wherever we have customer service improvements, particularly for community members, we're always going to try to do better.",101,,
566,0.97,4851.413,4856.151,"So it was heard, and received very well.",101,,
567,0.97,4856.151,4867.229,"What I will add is that we do, we know that there's a balance between getting it as right as possible.",101,,
568,0.97,4867.229,4869.731,Taking appropriate risks and still moving things forward.,101,,
569,0.97,4869.731,4883.178,"So while we are still, you know, about six months in, we are trying to do all of those things as well as we possibly can as well.",101,,
570,0.97,4883.178,4906.601,"We know we are rolling the plane as we fly, but we are trying to be responsible with the resources, a Al-Sadr resources as well as the needs of the community, and trying to not be successful in the projects and programs that we would put them out for, so we do take all of those resources into account.",101,,
571,0.97,4906.601,4914.743,"We will continue to keep you all as Council, and central staff, engaged, I think.",101,,
572,0.97,4914.743,4922.15,"Within the Mayor's team, we have regular Check-In meetings with almost every Councilmember.",101,,
573,0.97,4922.15,4933.862,"So Besides just our Conduit through Council staff, we also have regular calls with each of you, and we will continue to do that as we go forward.",101,,
574,0.97,4933.862,4939.0,"If there are ever any questions, we always maintain an open working relationship.",101,,
575,0.97,4939.0,4940.735,We want to maintain an open working relationship.,101,,
576,0.97,4940.735,4952.647,"We also want to be really clear and transparent as much as possible with our Seattle public around what we're doing, and what we're trying.",101,,
577,0.97,4952.647,4978.707,"They won't all be home runs, but we will put forth the effort to make sure that we are as responsive as we possibly can, but also as, you know, wherever we can preview where there might be holes, we'll try our best to mitigate that risk, to make sure we're not putting people's livelihood, or lives in danger.",101,,
578,0.97,4978.707,4984.412,"Just one closing remark on this, because I think Councilmember Nelson hit on a good point.",102,,
579,0.97,4984.412,4987.782,If we can provide the appropriate response.,102,,
580,0.97,4987.782,5010.538,"Just to share a brief anecdote that the other day in Queen Anne, there's a fairly, there's an individual with some public health issues that has had several outbursts in neighborhoods around the Queen Anne neighborhood.",102,,
581,0.97,5010.538,5012.207,Police responded to attempt an intervention.,102,,
582,0.97,5012.207,5019.981,"After about two hours of working with the person, they weren't able to do anything, because they couldn't establish probable cause for a crime.",102,,
583,0.97,5019.981,5022.684,They didn't have access to a resource the person could take advantage of.,102,,
584,0.97,5022.684,5029.124,It's not the fault of those police officers that it wasn't an efficacious response.,102,,
585,0.97,5029.124,5030.125,It's not what they're trained to do.,102,,
586,0.97,5030.125,5043.505,"That is one of the holes in our current system, this experience by my constituents on a daily basis, and it's a hole that these other cities and systems are able to fill.",102,,
587,0.97,5043.505,5046.341,"It means no disrespect to the police, they did their best.",102,,
588,0.97,5046.341,5057.118,"They showed up, but the two hours they spent with that individual could have been spent with a number of other obligations that are on their plate.",102,,
589,0.97,5057.118,5071.933,"I think it really shows, you know, if we look at the whole economy of our responses, and what we need to respond to, to honor our true charter response for safety, we need to fill that gap with something.",102,,
590,0.97,5071.933,5080.508,It's also not the case that every response with a police officer under the current regime is an efficacious response.,102,,
591,0.97,5080.508,5093.254,"In many cases, it's not due all at to the professionalism of the police, due to the limited number of tools at their disposal, and do to the limits of what they're able to resolve.",102,,
592,0.97,5093.254,5093.922,I appreciate that.,103,,
593,0.97,5093.922,5101.329,"And one of the things that we have long Under-Funded mental health, and mental health supports.",103,,
594,0.97,5101.329,5116.644,"I will say the one resource we have, and it's not going to come soon enough, but will be in a few years, there's going to be an emergency mental health hospital, where people, that is going to be in North Seattle, it's going to be in the Northwest hospital.",103,,
595,0.97,5116.644,5119.013,It will have 130 beds.,103,,
596,0.97,5119.013,5123.051,I think we're all anxiously awaiting for that particular resource to come Online.,103,,
597,0.97,5123.051,5138.399,"We are hearing from our law enforcement officers that they need a place to be able to take people in mental health crisis, that is not an arrest.",103,,
598,0.97,5138.399,5156.15,"Not imprisonment, so when that resource comes Online, we're looking forward to how we can potentially add to that particular resource, and other resources in other areas around the city of Seattle, so that we will have places to take people in their mental health crisis that isn't Criminalizing them.",103,,
599,0.97,5156.15,5163.758,"So that is a part of our overall blueprint going forward, and we know that it is in desperate need for the city.",103,,
600,0.97,5163.758,5177.305,"Don't forget the low Acuity filter that the Councilmember contributed to last year, that I think is on a little bit of a faster--Online.",104,,
601,0.97,5177.305,5181.576,So the mental health reference is a great Segway into our next agenda item.,104,,
602,0.97,5181.576,5184.279,I really appreciate you being with us today.,104,,
603,0.97,5184.279,5185.747,Thank you for your time today.,105,,
604,0.97,5185.747,5191.486,"Yeah, we'd really love if we could aim for the second meeting in July to come back.",106,,
605,0.97,5191.486,5214.876,"You Referenced the fact that the call analysis is going to be due any day now, so I'm hoping that the first three weeks of July could be used with the Interworking, interdepartmental working group going over that work, and coming back and presenting to us in our second meeting in July.",106,,
606,0.97,5214.876,5216.844,That would be very welcome.,106,,
607,0.97,5216.844,5223.117,"I also just want to flag, I'd love the opportunity to talk to you more about the CSO hiring.",106,,
608,0.97,5223.117,5265.026,"Whether or not the executive is intending to use the tools with the ability to pay for relocation costs to recruit folks from other locations, and also, whether or not we, the Council had put some money in to speed up background checks for police Officersism I want to make sure that third party, the funding that we provided for third party screening of police officers is also being used for CSO's, I'm hearing that the Timeline for background checks in the hiring process for CSO's, is creating a little bit of a backup, so we'd love to talk to you more about how to address those things.",106,,
609,0.97,5265.026,5265.56,"Wonderful, thank you.",107,,
610,0.97,5265.56,5266.094,All right.,108,,
611,0.97,5266.094,5271.432,"Clerk, can you read the next item into the agenda please?",108,,
612,0.97,5271.432,5279.44,Agenda item three is overview of 988 and behavioral health crisis system.,109,,
613,0.97,5279.44,5281.342,Thank you so much.,110,,
614,0.97,5281.342,5299.56,"We have folks, this morning representing King County's behavioral health, and recovery division, and crisis connections to talk about the new 988 number, and the behavioral crisis system.",110,,
615,0.97,5299.56,5306.401,Will folks please introduce themselves?,110,,
616,0.97,5306.401,5306.801,Good morning.,111,,
617,0.97,5306.801,5307.435,I am Kelli Nomura.,111,,
618,0.97,5307.435,5309.203,Thank you for having us today.,111,,
619,0.97,5309.203,5327.422,"There is definitely a nice nexus here and a perfect Segway for what we are going to be sharing with you today after Michelle and Michael introduce themselves, maybe I can make a few comments, and then I'll turn it over to them for their presentation.",111,,
620,0.97,5327.422,5329.39,Thanks Kelli.,112,,
621,0.97,5329.39,5338.9,I'm Michael reading for the committee of King County.,112,,
622,0.97,5338.9,5342.503,We have been operating the crisis line for King County since 1964.,113,,
623,0.97,5342.503,5347.875,"So again, thank you for having us this morning.",114,,
624,0.97,5347.875,5353.981,It was really helpful to listen to 911 conversation.,114,,
625,0.97,5353.981,5364.325,"I really do think there is some wonderful opportunity here for partnership for King County crisis connections and the city, so just really appreciate being a part of this conversation.",114,,
626,0.97,5364.325,5386.347,"One of the things you'll hear a lot about the 988 call line that is going into effect soon here, but as part of preparing for this, as well as recognizing the need for our communities, we have done significant work in Coronaviruses about expanding or crisis response and supporting our communities, including Partnering with law enforcement.",114,,
627,0.97,5386.347,5393.321,"And so, you know, a few things were mentioned clearly.",114,,
628,0.97,5393.321,5402.597,"Our behavioral health system has been Under-Funded for a long time, and we are very appreciative of the recognition of that, and what we're seeing in many ways, additional funding coming our way.",114,,
629,0.97,5402.597,5413.374,"So we very much appreciate that, and want to partner with everyone to make sure those resources are most efficiently implemented.",114,,
630,0.97,5413.374,5426.954,"The example of somebody who was needing intervention and the law enforcement officers attempted to intervene, a understand really could not do much and also did not have a place for them to take someone.",114,,
631,0.97,5426.954,5447.575,"You heard earlier the emergency mental health hospital that is coming Online, which we're looking forward to, but we want to also make sure you're aware that King County was recently awarded through the last legislative session, capital dollars to begin Dolling out what we're calling crisis centers.",114,,
632,0.97,5447.575,5463.09,"That is a place for law enforcement to bring someone who is in a behavioral health crisis, so they can take someone to a safe place, and move onto their next call.",114,,
633,0.97,5463.09,5465.593,We're actually meeting with members.,114,,
634,0.97,5465.593,5469.497,"City of Seattle Council and others, the Mayor's office, as we're building these concepts.",114,,
635,0.97,5469.497,5473.067,So we're very happy to be a part of these conversations with all of you.,114,,
636,0.97,5473.067,5480.875,We just want to make sure you know that in addition to the resources that you heard about just now about 911.,114,,
637,0.97,5480.875,5501.195,"King County is definitely having the same conversations and our goal is just to make sure that we are communicating and Partnering, so that we are building together responses to these needs, and making sure that we're working on a plan together, and not inadvertently working against each other, as we build out these resources.",114,,
638,0.97,5501.195,5508.202,"So I'm going to stop there, and turn this over to Michelle and Michael.",114,,
639,0.97,5508.202,5511.672,"But again, thank you for having us.",114,,
640,0.97,5511.672,5513.774,Just a couple of remarks on moving forward.,115,,
641,0.97,5513.774,5516.811,I really appreciate you joining us this morning to share this work.,115,,
642,0.97,5516.811,5523.985,I believe this is actually our second conversation on the new 988 system.,115,,
643,0.97,5523.985,5525.152,We had an early conversation last year.,115,,
644,0.97,5525.152,5532.36,"We have a lot of material to cover here, so I promised that I'd help manage the time.",115,,
645,0.97,5532.36,5533.694,So you all can get through it.,115,,
646,0.97,5533.694,5535.73,So we're asking that we hold questions until the end.,115,,
647,0.97,5535.73,5547.408,"And if we don't have time to get to answers of questions, we have Ann Gorman from Council central staff monitoring the conversation.",115,,
648,0.97,5547.408,5556.584,She can help get questions answered Offline after the meeting in the interest of time.,115,,
649,0.97,5556.584,5556.884,Thank you.,115,,
650,0.97,5556.884,5557.251,Thank you.,116,,
651,0.97,5557.251,5561.355,"So I'm going to start us off, if we can go to the next slide, thank you.",116,,
652,0.97,5561.355,5576.17,"So briefly, I just want to review that I will touch on what is the Bhaso, that's the administrative service organization of what is our role and responsibility as an ASO, and within the ASO, what the crisis continues to look like for King County.",116,,
653,0.97,5576.17,5591.552,"And Michelle is going to touch on the National 988 process, and how that's being implemented through the House bill 1477 through much of state legislation, and then Michelle and I will talk about alternatives to law enforcement response.",116,,
654,0.97,5591.552,5598.326,"So this is a picture, just a very brief background of the ASO.",116,,
655,0.97,5598.326,5599.093,These are the regions.,116,,
656,0.97,5599.093,5610.237,"There's ten regions in Washington state that are considered ASO administrative associations, that were stood up with the health committee.",116,,
657,0.97,5610.237,5626.053,The purpose is to fully participate in fully integrated manage care when we were required to step into integrated manage care and the managed care organizations MCO's step in to Washington State to manage Medicate purchasing behavioral health.,116,,
658,0.97,5626.053,5630.591,And that's fully integrated with behavioral health and physical Healthcare.,116,,
659,0.97,5630.591,5647.508,"But in order to continue the Nonmedicaid services and crisis centers, ASO's were stood up, required to, replaced in January 2020.",116,,
660,0.97,5647.508,5652.446,King County became an ASO in 2019 and have been operating ever since.,116,,
661,0.97,5652.446,5658.019,"You can see King and Pierce, because of our population are single County regions.",116,,
662,0.97,5658.019,5663.324,"Other areas are Multicounty regions, as you can see by the map.",116,,
663,0.97,5663.324,5687.915,"And within that, the ASO, I'll talk about crisis services a little more in a second, but we also have a function to administer state funded Nonmedical services, such as block funds, and we continue working with state hospital for a hospital liaison functions, and other functions, such as assisted outpatient treatment.",116,,
664,0.97,5687.915,5690.051,"Jail transition services, just to name a few.",116,,
665,0.97,5690.051,5698.059,Kind much like an ongoing list on our funding table of our Non- Medicaid services that we operate in the ASO.,116,,
666,0.97,5698.059,5699.827,"Next slide, thank you.",116,,
667,0.97,5699.827,5721.282,"So specifically, for crisis services, these are the areas of which we are required to have by our contract with the Healthcare authority starting with a 24/7 regional crisis line, mobile crisis response, I'll talk more about that in a second.",116,,
668,0.97,5721.282,5730.758,"As well as to designate crisis responders, who are designated by the county who do I.T.",116,,
669,0.97,5730.758,5745.306,"Investigations for those reviewed for involuntary hold, according to Rsvw, and then we also oversee management, and stabilize facilities, and involuntary treatment.",116,,
670,0.97,5745.306,5747.074,Next slide.,116,,
671,0.97,5747.074,5755.382,"So to put that into a continuum picture, just to show you the dark Clarks are the ones required with the Healthcare Autority.",116,,
672,0.97,5755.382,5764.425,But the lighter colored services are also crisis services that we establish in King County that I believe are important for our community.,116,,
673,0.97,5764.425,5772.833,"They're not funded by the state, but are funded locally, so we can continue to build that response for crisis systems on a 24/7 basis.",116,,
674,0.97,5772.833,5783.277,"So we have other programs like emergency appointments, so we could help be seen by a provider within 24 hours by skid You'Lling an appointment.",116,,
675,0.97,5783.277,5786.614,"I'll talk more about mobile crisis, and emergency service patrol.",116,,
676,0.97,5786.614,5798.726,"But we have other programs like the crisis diversion facility, hospital diversion bed, so we have what we think is a richer crisis continuum.",116,,
677,0.97,5798.726,5806.267,"To Kelli's point, we also understand as we've done analysis and assessment that we do have some gaps.",116,,
678,0.97,5806.267,5812.973,"For example, we don't have triage facilities for Fluidly throughout the county for law enforcement to bring people to.",116,,
679,0.97,5812.973,5824.385,"And that's one of the values of the implementation is to talk about the safe place to go, rather than relying on the hospital setting.",116,,
680,0.97,5824.385,5834.461,That's one of our future visions in the next number of years to see more facilities stood up throughout the county.,116,,
681,0.97,5834.461,5838.065,Next slide.,116,,
682,0.97,5838.065,5838.332,Michelle.,116,,
683,0.97,5838.332,5838.966,"Thank you, Michael.",117,,
684,0.97,5838.966,5855.95,"So as I mentioned at the top, crisis connections has been providing the crisis Lane services for King County through that contract since 1964, but crisis connections is also for a little over a decade, also a contact center for the national suicide prevention lifeline.",117,,
685,0.97,5855.95,5865.659,"So at the very highest level, really what 988, is migrating from a 10 digit number to the 988 number.",117,,
686,0.97,5865.659,5870.798,So the national suicide prevention lifeline has been in operation since 2005.,117,,
687,0.97,5870.798,5876.537,Without funding to the call centers like ours to provide the service.,117,,
688,0.97,5876.537,5883.344,So we have been Embedding this service within the crisis line that we're answering for King County.,117,,
689,0.97,5883.344,5891.051,"So again, our focus for the national suicide prevention lifeline is responding to calls from King County area codes.",117,,
690,0.97,5891.051,5896.924,So we are one of about 200 contact centers around the country that are answering lifeline calls.,117,,
691,0.97,5896.924,5900.628,"So back in 2020, the U.S.",117,,
692,0.97,5900.628,5907.668,"Congress had actually passed the national suicide Hotline designation act, which designated 988.",117,,
693,0.97,5907.668,5911.772,So it will be going into effect nationally on July 16th.,117,,
694,0.97,5911.772,5913.607,So very soon.,117,,
695,0.97,5913.607,5932.326,"So we have actively, as crisis connections, been building a separate 9918, since now there is funding through the Washington State Department of health through a fee on phone lines to be able to actually have the funding to build this out.",117,,
696,0.97,5932.326,5948.075,"We are estimating through vibrant, which is the National administrator for the national suicide prevention lifeline potential of doubling the calls with this version from a ten digit to a three digit.",117,,
697,0.97,5948.075,5950.978,"The services, however, to callers will not change.",117,,
698,0.97,5950.978,5957.284,Our commitment is that this will be seamless for people who are calling.,117,,
699,0.97,5957.284,5966.76,"So right now, as Miked has mentioned, we had a continuum of crisis services, many of which at the call center level we are able to dispatch as needed.",117,,
700,0.97,5966.76,5970.464,Our commitment is that that should continue to be seamless.,117,,
701,0.97,5970.464,5973.1,There are improvements to be made for sure.,117,,
702,0.97,5973.1,5974.868,There are gaps to be filled for sure.,117,,
703,0.97,5974.868,5987.715,"But we really want to take a community member focused approach to this, and make sure that we do not have any interruption service, or any situations where callers are being bounced around.",117,,
704,0.97,5987.715,5991.418,We want to make sure this is as seamless as possible.,117,,
705,0.97,5991.418,6012.239,"That is the promise of 988 is to be able to do a number of things, but one is obviously to make it easier to access behavioral health support, but also to be able to reduce the stigma of asking for support, and asking for help.",117,,
706,0.97,6012.239,6020.147,"A five year vision for implementing 988, so I'll speak about the first one, that is specific to call centers.",117,,
707,0.97,6020.147,6028.222,"That it that there will be someone to talk to, that 90% or more calls will be answered in state by 2023.",117,,
708,0.97,6028.222,6044.972,"What is meant by that, there are three contact centers within the station of Washington that are designated national suicide prevention lifeline contact centers, and of course, starting July 16th, 988.",117,,
709,0.97,6044.972,6049.743,"So those are crisis connections, frontier behavior all health, and volunteers of America, which is housed north of us.",117,,
710,0.97,6049.743,6056.717,"So the idea is that, at least 90% of calls will be answered by contact centers within the state.",117,,
711,0.97,6056.717,6070.864,"What happens with the system is it gets routed, so if a contact center is not able to answer a call within a specified period of time, that call will be bounced to a national contact center backup that's often in New York.",117,,
712,0.97,6070.864,6085.179,"So the idea is we want to make sure that as much as possible, when someone is calling 988 within the state of Washington that they are able to talk to a contact person within the state of Washington.",117,,
713,0.97,6085.179,6091.018,"So Michael, do you want to discuss horizon two and three?",117,,
714,0.97,6091.018,6094.321,Sure.,118,,
715,0.97,6094.321,6101.795,"So we left this vision of Samhsa's painting, because it really says it's not about a place to call.",118,,
716,0.97,6101.795,6111.004,"I think for many people, the phone call is incredibly helpful and valuable, and I would say most calls resolved by that conversation.",118,,
717,0.97,6111.004,6115.843,But there are those that call it that need more of a response.,118,,
718,0.97,6115.843,6137.231,"So with 988 becoming implemented nationwide, Washington state has implemented House bill 1477 to talk about how we in Washington state will implement 9888 by enhancing our call center hubs, connections, and the other two that Michelle mentioned, but also to talk about the other crisis services within a continuum.",118,,
719,0.97,6137.231,6146.74,So some way to respond is about enhancing our mobile response teams.,118,,
720,0.97,6146.74,6148.475,So all received funding for enhancing teams.,118,,
721,0.97,6148.475,6153.413,In King County we've had a children's crisis response family for years.,118,,
722,0.97,6153.413,6157.384,We were one of only two regions in the state that had that.,118,,
723,0.97,6157.384,6160.621,Other regions were funded for additional youth crisis teams.,118,,
724,0.97,6160.621,6167.761,We in King County received additional funding because of 988-Dollars to almost double our mobile crisis response team.,118,,
725,0.97,6167.761,6172.199,"I have some numbers later, I can show you what that looks like.",118,,
726,0.97,6172.199,6185.679,"They've done that earlier this year by awarding a contract with a provider to grow our mobile crisis response team, and then Finally, I mentioned that the safe place to go.",118,,
727,0.97,6185.679,6193.654,"So thinking about those crisis facilities, strategically placed around the county, especially in the city of Seattle, where we have a very dense population.",118,,
728,0.97,6193.654,6203.297,"So we're creating a vision as to what that looks like, with additional funding that's coming our way in order to provide that safe place for help.",118,,
729,0.97,6203.297,6216.276,"And that's a great resource for law enforcement so that they do have a place to go drop somebody off for a possible evaluation or stabilization, and be on their way to their next call.",118,,
730,0.97,6216.276,6216.777,"Back to you, Michelle.",118,,
731,0.97,6216.777,6221.381,We'll throw down a little bit more into Washington state house bill 1477.,119,,
732,0.97,6221.381,6234.328,"As I mentioned before, at the very highest level this conversion is basically a ten digit number to a three digit number, moving to 988.",119,,
733,0.97,6234.328,6253.413,Really what has happened with our legislators is they really made an opportunity to focus on doing some reform to find additional funding and to really prevent this from having a very Antiquatedsome around behavioral health.,119,,
734,0.97,6253.413,6269.329,"So it provides dedicated funding to local national suicide prevention call centers for the first time as well as Michael mentioned, funding to improve crisis centers across the country, or across the state, I should say.",119,,
735,0.97,6269.329,6276.603,"So I did want to highlight here where other states are, related to legislation for 988.",119,,
736,0.97,6276.603,6286.98,"Again, there is no dedicated funding attached to this there is some implementation funding that's coming through with grants from Samsa, however, not dedicated funding.",119,,
737,0.97,6286.98,6305.098,"You can see here that Washington state is just of four States so far to have 988 implementation, and attach a fee.",119,,
738,0.97,6305.098,6307.934,"We have Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Virginia.",119,,
739,0.97,6307.934,6309.77,Other States have legislation without funding.,119,,
740,0.97,6309.77,6317.444,"We will see over time, other states develop.",119,,
741,0.97,6317.444,6317.644,This.,119,,
742,0.97,6317.644,6321.114,A little bit more about what was passed back last summer.,119,,
743,0.97,6321.114,6327.32,"Again, one of power States to do this very Progressive.",119,,
744,0.97,6327.32,6338.965,"So the funding is really focused again on supporting product Centerses like ours, as well as building out a more robust behavioral health crisis.",119,,
745,0.97,6338.965,6351.978,"Beginning in October of 2021, if you look at your phone bill, would you see there was a 24- cent per month fee attached, and that will go up, beginning January of 2023 to 44 cents.",119,,
746,0.97,6351.978,6361.955,Those funds have been outlined in House bill 1477 to be used for operations of call center hubs.,119,,
747,0.97,6361.955,6374.034,"So again, the three I outlined, including crisis connections, as well as a tribal forced Hub.",119,,
748,0.97,6374.034,6376.103,Technology solutions and crisis service expansion.,119,,
749,0.97,6376.103,6383.91,The legislation also outlined what is called the Chris committee.,119,,
750,0.97,6383.91,6385.412,This responds for crisis improvement committee.,119,,
751,0.97,6385.412,6388.148,There is a steering committee that overseeing this work.,119,,
752,0.97,6388.148,6388.915,And many Subcommittees.,119,,
753,0.97,6388.915,6409.403,"But the idea is that this is the group that develops the recommendations to support the implementation of the National 988 suicide prevention Hotline, and the statewide improvement of behavioral crisis response, and suicide Preventions in the state.",119,,
754,0.97,6409.403,6413.34,So the committee appointees are appointed by the governor.,119,,
755,0.97,6413.34,6424.284,I did want to touch on a couple of those to give you a little more sense.,119,,
756,0.97,6424.284,6431.158,"[no Audio] is getting us ready for the July 16th launch, which is right around the corner.",119,,
757,0.97,6431.158,6440.5,"Some other improvements in investments, we will start seeing those in 2023, and 2024, and potentially further out.",119,,
758,0.97,6440.5,6458.051,"I mentioned before, this is the Washington tribal 988 group that's examining and making recommendations with respect to the needs of the tribes related to the 988 system, related to the American health Association.",119,,
759,0.97,6458.051,6460.554,There is also a collaborative response.,119,,
760,0.97,6460.554,6479.372,"This defines the complementary roles in response to rapid response crisis teams, designated crisis responders, law enforcement, first responders, of course 911 and 988 operators, public health plans and so on and so forth.",119,,
761,0.97,6479.372,6486.479,"So again, we're making sure we are not developing these plans in isolation, and they are Siloed.",119,,
762,0.97,6486.479,6488.615,Last I will call out the group in experience.,119,,
763,0.97,6488.615,6501.995,"This is a perspective that is very valuable in this work as well, which is to engage the perspective of individuals, and family members with lived experience, related to recommendations outlined by House bill 1477.",119,,
764,0.97,6501.995,6509.269,We want today spend some time talking specifically about what are some of the alternatives to armed response.,119,,
765,0.97,6509.269,6513.073,Because I think that's a great priority for all of us.,119,,
766,0.97,6513.073,6520.78,We want to make sure that law enforcement is focusing on being there and present in the areas they're trained.,119,,
767,0.97,6520.78,6523.183,"And again, that's supporting around law enforcement.",119,,
768,0.97,6523.183,6526.019,They are not expected to be behavior health experts.,119,,
769,0.97,6526.019,6532.459,So one of the questions we received in advance is how is 988 different than 911?,119,,
770,0.97,6532.459,6541.401,"Of course 988 was established to give access to crisis services in a way that meets our country's brewing suicide, and mental health crisis.",119,,
771,0.97,6541.401,6548.275,"988 will provide easier access to of course the lifeline network, those 200 contact centers around the country.",119,,
772,0.97,6548.275,6552.379,And which are distinct from public safety purposes of 911.,119,,
773,0.97,6552.379,6558.585,"And 911 is focused, of course, on dispatching emergency medical service, fire needs.",119,,
774,0.97,6558.585,6563.189,Let's make sure we are servicing that appropriately.,119,,
775,0.97,6563.189,6569.629,We have been coordinating since our founding in 1964 with 911.,119,,
776,0.97,6569.629,6572.265,That is not something new.,119,,
777,0.97,6572.265,6584.144,"We are in constant conversation with 911 center within our region, to make sure, if there is a life safety situation, that our call takers are dealing with, that we bring in the right resources.",119,,
778,0.97,6584.144,6608.168,"So this is a situation which our staff are volunteers here are supporting someone who is actively considering suicide, and is not Partnershipping in trying to find alternatives and to get support we may be bringing in 911 as appropriate, and bringing in them again, not necessarily transferring the call to 911.",119,,
779,0.97,6608.168,6612.973,"We would keep custody so to speak of that call, but bringing in the right resource.",119,,
780,0.97,6612.973,6635.195,"We are, as you heard, actively working on improvements, actively making sure that we are El Vatting our training, so making sure that we have heard from 911 operators they would like more training and Gedding what the resources are, they're very interested in that.",119,,
781,0.97,6635.195,6643.003,We're actively working with 911S in the 988 call center to standardize the protocols.,119,,
782,0.97,6643.003,6655.382,"We need to standardize and make sure we're using best practices, so we're in the process of doing that, and literally sitting down for hours in process mapping and working that out.",119,,
783,0.97,6655.382,6661.287,"That is including the Bhaso's in that process, of course.",119,,
784,0.97,6661.287,6669.195,We are Partnershipping in training 911 operators.,119,,
785,0.97,6669.195,6671.631,"Again, something they're very interested in.",119,,
786,0.97,6671.631,6678.738,"Also, currently betting one of our Clinicians at 911.",119,,
787,0.97,6678.738,6695.488,"So we're Piloting Embedding a Commission to sit on the Frontlineses in the moment to educate, and support the 911 operators and make sure the calls get connected to an appropriate place, so make sure we're focusing on eliminating people's emotional distress.",119,,
788,0.97,6695.488,6704.564,I did want to speak briefly about the one call program that we launched as a pilot in 2019.,119,,
789,0.97,6704.564,6710.67,"With the support of Councilmember Herbold, we're able to secure funding through this calendar year.",119,,
790,0.97,6710.67,6734.761,"So this is a special line that we have just for first responders in King County to be able to talk to a crisis Clinician's Commission, and get someone en route to a call that appears that may have a behavioral health component to it, or if it's discovered at that moment there may be a behavioral health component.",119,,
791,0.97,6734.761,6754.514,"You can find they can call this line 24/7, and speak to a behavioral health provider, to be able to get Realtime information including, if there is any engagement with this individual, we would be able to provide that.",119,,
792,0.97,6754.514,6759.752,Very helpful whether on scene or before they get on scene.,119,,
793,0.97,6759.752,6760.353,Deescalating the situation.,119,,
794,0.97,6760.353,6770.93,"All the things you can see here on the slide, including access to other components of the behavioral health system, that are available, like a next day appointment.",119,,
795,0.97,6770.93,6779.172,We also provide follow up with individuals that the first responders have engaged with.,119,,
796,0.97,6779.172,6783.076,So this is a very unique program that crisis sections is providing in this area.,119,,
797,0.97,6783.076,6790.683,"I do want to point out that we launched it in 2019, in October.",119,,
798,0.97,6790.683,6802.562,"You can see here the first month, we got one call from first responders, certainly through 2020, and we've been trying to roll out the program kind of stable going up quite a bit in some areas.",119,,
799,0.97,6802.562,6817.21,"But as you can see here now that we have more dedicated funding, and the ability to do more outreach and engagement and really engage with the first responders to improving the system.",119,,
800,0.97,6817.21,6821.881,You can see that the volume of calls continues to ramp up.,119,,
801,0.97,6821.881,6825.552,So we're very excited to see that program really starting to take off.,119,,
802,0.97,6825.552,6830.823,I'm going to turn you over now to Michael for our final slides.,119,,
803,0.97,6830.823,6844.137,"When you think about alternative responses to law enforcement, I would say the mobile crisis team is a key service to really talk about.",120,,
804,0.97,6844.137,6846.472,I've worked in a King County behavioral system for years.,120,,
805,0.97,6846.472,6859.352,"And I remember when it started out for the mobile crisis team typically in many regions, the designated crisis responders are also the crisis response teams.",120,,
806,0.97,6859.352,6875.468,"That doesn't really work for us in King County because our Dcr's is so consumed with their time with the high cases, that they don't get time to do crisis outreach.",120,,
807,0.97,6875.468,6893.253,So we have dedicated mobile crisis response team that is for adult responses and we also contract with the YMCA for the children's youth crisis outreach.,120,,
808,0.97,6893.253,6894.42,We call them cores.,120,,
809,0.97,6894.42,6895.255,Childrens outreach response system.,120,,
810,0.97,6895.255,6904.564,"We found it was stood up largely for the purpose of access by being accessed by law enforcement, and it slowly started that way.",120,,
811,0.97,6904.564,6913.139,We now have the crisis line Accessing mobile crisis and dispatching the team to the crisis line as well as a direct call from law enforcement officer.,120,,
812,0.97,6913.139,6919.779,So any officer in King county can call the mobile crisis team directly.,120,,
813,0.97,6919.779,6924.784,The mobile crisis team operates 24 hours a day.,120,,
814,0.97,6924.784,6933.559,"And it's truest form, according to the Washington Department health requirements there has to be two mental health providers that respond.",120,,
815,0.97,6933.559,6944.203,"That's actually changing, and we're looking at the Doh rules and guidelines to see how peers are also involved in mobile crisis response, by a mental health professional.",120,,
816,0.97,6944.203,6955.048,And I think that's a key strategy in terms of looking at the workforce that's been a challenge in terms ever hiring qualified staff workforce to do the work.,120,,
817,0.97,6955.048,6965.091,"So peers are very Affective in doing outreach work, and we're starting to see them more involved in mobile crisis response.",120,,
818,0.97,6965.091,6969.262,"Those responses are for primarily mental health, or calls.",120,,
819,0.97,6969.262,6974.634,And local law enforcement can ask them directly.,120,,
820,0.97,6974.634,6975.735,They also provide transportation.,120,,
821,0.97,6975.735,6986.479,"The mobile crisis team will do a bit of a follow-up, and if somebody needs a next day appointment, they can actually connect them with the next day appointment, and even drive them to that appointment.",120,,
822,0.97,6986.479,6995.188,Because the goal of the mobile crisis team is to resolve the crisis and help people to connect to ongoing services and supports.,120,,
823,0.97,6995.188,7009.669,"The intention of 988 is to, I've heard this talked about nationally, and even within the Chris community is to look at 988 like 911, so there could be a response dispatched just like 911 through 988.",120,,
824,0.97,7009.669,7023.416,"That said I think we have a lot of work to do to get there, because, you know one of my staff looked at law enforcement in King County, there's about 3500 officers throughout King County.",120,,
825,0.97,7023.416,7026.886,That could be maybe dispatched through 911 at any moment.,120,,
826,0.97,7026.886,7030.79,"In the mobile crisis team, we have 39 staff.",120,,
827,0.97,7030.79,7032.525,That's a very big difference from 3500.,120,,
828,0.97,7032.525,7043.536,"I was happy to say that we got funding to almost double the team, but we're doubling 39, so we actually were able to have another 22 ft's, to the mobile crisis team.",120,,
829,0.97,7043.536,7047.006,So still a long way to go.,120,,
830,0.97,7047.006,7059.652,"That said, I think Dse works incredibly hard at the work they do, because they're held to a standard to emerge, in needs within two hours, and urgent needs within 24 hours.",120,,
831,0.97,7059.652,7069.962,"Before we move onto the next slide, not a question, but just a clarification for the viewing public and a reminder for my Council colleagues in case a refresher is helpful.",121,,
832,0.97,7069.962,7080.206,Just want to note that the Council has significantly increased funding for the mobile crisis team.,121,,
833,0.97,7080.206,7104.597,"Over two budget cycles in the 2021 budget Council, council funded a million to fill a short fall in the county's mental illness and drug dependency tax, that funding supported existing positions and allowed to add to create two behavioral health teams.",121,,
834,0.97,7104.597,7116.509,"Then in 2022, council provided $2.5 million in expansion funds for the mobile crisis teams in the behavioral response teams, and I want to recognize the leadership of Councilmember Strauss in this area.",121,,
835,0.97,7116.509,7124.016,And we're working with Council central staff to get a better understanding of the status of that expansion.,121,,
836,0.97,7124.016,7124.817,Thanks for that clarification.,122,,
837,0.97,7124.817,7128.02,"That's super helpful, in order to recognize that.",122,,
838,0.97,7128.02,7129.689,We do a lot of funding.,122,,
839,0.97,7129.689,7140.166,"The needs that we have in King County, and in the Seattle community, we just don't have enough funding from the state to meet that need.",122,,
840,0.97,7140.166,7143.136,"So we do [inaudible] Mid- funding, and city council funding as well.",122,,
841,0.97,7143.136,7144.237,So thank you for that.,122,,
842,0.97,7144.237,7150.476,"The last thing I will reflect on is emergency service patrol, and I bring this up, this is not an ASO service.",122,,
843,0.97,7150.476,7166.826,"You can see right in the first line here, it's pretty amazing that we've been doing emergency service patrol since 1976.",122,,
844,0.97,7166.826,7174.5,"We have a specific area dedicated to Seattle for you can see in the picture of these vans, we have three vans that are available 24/7.",122,,
845,0.97,7174.5,7198.391,"We have a team of drivers that are trained to do outreach and engagement in the downtown area of Seattle for those on the street that are homeless, that may have signs of Intoxication or substantial substance abuse.",122,,
846,0.97,7198.391,7207.266,"If 911 SEES that the call could be diverted to an ESP response, that happens.",122,,
847,0.97,7207.266,7213.806,"Sometimes they want to divert that call to ESP, they will also then call ESP directly as well.",122,,
848,0.97,7213.806,7222.481,"So you know, we are an alternate response, as well as a Co-Response at times, which helps alleviate law enforcement response.",122,,
849,0.97,7222.481,7225.618,And the city of Seattle also does fund part of the ESP service as well.,122,,
850,0.97,7225.618,7232.858,I just want to also flag on that one.,123,,
851,0.97,7232.858,7258.05,"Because of the questions about the suitability of the prior administration's model for triage one, the Council requested the executive report back on whether or not the appropriate workforce was in fact the Seattle fire Department I was originally proposed for triage one.",123,,
852,0.97,7258.05,7288.18,"The report back to that request from council as it relates to triage one, again that is for persons down in wellness checks identified not only CSO's, as an appropriate Responder, but also these particular ESP responders, because as Michael explained, not only are they dealing with that particular demographic, but they're also currently dispatched from 911.",123,,
853,0.97,7288.18,7305.131,"So that might be another alternative to, if we're continuing to have capacity issues with CSO's being on to take on that body of work, perhaps the ESP response might be an appropriate thing to take a look at.",123,,
854,0.97,7305.131,7316.509,"And I'm happy to share that report with my colleagues, so they can see that the executive themselves identified ESP as an appropriate Responder for those two types of calls.",123,,
855,0.97,7316.509,7317.91,Thank you.,123,,
856,0.97,7317.91,7321.314,That is the end of our presentation.,124,,
857,0.97,7321.314,7325.084,"So I'll pass it back to you, Councilmember.",124,,
858,0.97,7325.084,7325.418,Fantastic.,125,,
859,0.97,7325.418,7329.288,Thank you so much.,125,,
860,0.97,7329.288,7347.34,"Folks, I know I suggested we may not have time for questions, but if folks have questions that they want to get out, and we can see if some of them can be answered, that would be great, otherwise we can try to take some questions and collect them Offline.",125,,
861,0.97,7347.34,7356.515,"Not seeing any raised hands, I do want to ask a question that I had.",125,,
862,0.97,7356.515,7380.74,"There's some of this three part, or scaled vision sort of Sequentially over time and one of them includes funding sort of the Secondstage of not just having somebody to talk to, but having more consistency of somebody to respond.",125,,
863,0.97,7380.74,7395.221,And the five year vision on slide seven identifies sort of what the schedule is.,125,,
864,0.97,7395.221,7402.294,I'm just wondering how much of this three part vision is actually funded?,125,,
865,0.97,7402.294,7403.062,Do we have a Pathway?,125,,
866,0.97,7403.062,7410.302,Really appreciate that we had the vision to fund the startup with the fee as opposed to other cities that are still faltering there.,125,,
867,0.97,7410.302,7418.978,But I'm just wondering a little bit more about the next stage.,125,,
868,0.97,7418.978,7428.721,"So for this second horizon to respond, we did get some additional funding from the House authority.",126,,
869,0.97,7428.721,7429.722,It was did 2.5 million.,126,,
870,0.97,7429.722,7436.028,"When you leverage Medicate, we did an award for another $2.3 million to expand the mobile crisis team.",126,,
871,0.97,7436.028,7443.135,"That said, I think my point is, we're expanding 39 FTE's, to add another 22.",126,,
872,0.97,7443.135,7446.672,That's as far as the funding goes.,126,,
873,0.97,7446.672,7447.106,Is that sufficient?,126,,
874,0.97,7447.106,7452.978,"I think time will tell, given the ability of calls we get in King County and the city of Seattle.",126,,
875,0.97,7452.978,7464.924,"I'm kind of fascinated to see what is 988 going to do to our behavioral health system in terms of crisis need, which is going to teach us how we need to continue to increase our ability to respond.",126,,
876,0.97,7464.924,7469.728,The third horizon is the safe place to go.,126,,
877,0.97,7469.728,7479.738,"There was through this past legislative action, there has been significant funding applied for crisis facilities around the state of Washington.",126,,
878,0.97,7479.738,7484.176,"Prior to that, we had specific Fnding to two facilities in King County.",126,,
879,0.97,7484.176,7494.954,"There was one down in South King County Lightth right now, and another ward that's still open right now for another facility in King County.",126,,
880,0.97,7494.954,7505.764,The stay at wide dollars are coming out to be 5.8Ish million dollars for six adult facilities and two youth facilities around the state.,126,,
881,0.97,7505.764,7516.308,"That said, I would encourage our King County providers to apply, so that we can see more crisis facilities be up.",126,,
882,0.97,7516.308,7520.312,Kelli and I are thinking about where those places need to be in King County.,126,,
883,0.97,7520.312,7526.886,"The city of Seattle being a very, very primary because of our density and crisis need.",126,,
884,0.97,7526.886,7531.924,"So Kelli, I don't know if you want to say any more about that.",126,,
885,0.97,7531.924,7533.192,"Thanks, Michael.",127,,
886,0.97,7533.192,7539.098,"I will just add those are the initial conversations, and advocacy work that we're all doing.",127,,
887,0.97,7539.098,7562.154,"We do know that we have, again, because of the increased recognition of everybody needing behavioral health, mental wellness support, particularly following Covid, we appreciate both locally, and at the state level the recognition for focusing on funding going forward.",127,,
888,0.97,7562.154,7570.129,"So there's continued advocacy with many legislators in Olympia who have joined us that we need to build the funding for this going forward, these phases going forward.",127,,
889,0.97,7570.129,7591.016,"So although we don't have full commitment for everything that we're envisioning, we do have significant hope that there will be ongoing recognition for the funding, to put at least some of the plans that we have and the city has and others in place to continue to strengthen our crisis response system.",127,,
890,0.97,7591.016,7595.688,"Thank you so much, Kelli, and Michael, and Michelle.",128,,
891,0.97,7595.688,7615.774,"Please do count on me as an advocacy partner as you continue your conversations around fully supporting this desperately needed system at this really important time when I think a lot of people are recognizing the mental, and behavioral health crisis that we're faced with right now.",128,,
892,0.97,7615.774,7628.921,"We've been faced with it for a long time, but I think there's a broader recognition that we need to seize on the momentum for that.",128,,
893,0.97,7628.921,7629.955,Not seeing any other questions.,128,,
894,0.97,7629.955,7632.224,I really appreciate your being with us.,128,,
895,0.97,7632.224,7634.76,"If we have follow up questions, I will send them your way.",128,,
896,0.97,7634.76,7639.898,Thank you for having us.,129,,
897,0.97,7639.898,7641.7,Appreciate it.,130,,
898,0.97,7641.7,7644.103,"Clerk, please read in agenda item four.",130,,
899,0.97,7644.103,7648.841,Community and oversight of the police.,131,,
900,0.97,7648.841,7678.337,"Establishing a process for investigating complaints, naming the chief of police, adding a new Subchapter 5 to 3.29 of the September municipal code Anded ordinance of 1.25, to Renumber the existing Subchapter 5, and sections 3.29, 5.00, and 3.29510 of the Seattle municipal code.",131,,
901,0.97,7678.337,7681.607,This is the third meeting for the bill.,132,,
902,0.97,7681.607,7688.614,The offense of police accountability and the office of the inspector general.,132,,
903,0.97,7688.614,7695.154,I'd like to ask central staff to describe the changes to the base bill in the substitute version.,132,,
904,0.97,7695.154,7704.73,"Just so folks understand the plan moving forward, I'd like to make sure that we get this bill before the committee at our next committee meeting.",132,,
905,0.97,7704.73,7725.417,"And we're just giving this additional time to make sure that the bill is ready to be codified, and that we fix any final technical errors, but my hope today is that we vote on the substitute, and bring it back to my next committee meeting on July 12th.",132,,
906,0.97,7725.417,7733.358,"With that, Greg and Asha we proceed, I think Asha is taking the lead here, on the overview of the changes of the bill.",132,,
907,0.97,7733.358,7735.694,Thank you.,132,,
908,0.97,7735.694,7742.334,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",133,,
909,0.97,7742.334,7743.368,Asha Venkataraman.,133,,
910,0.97,7743.368,7747.639,I'm Presentng this bill on behalf of my colleague Ann Gorman.,133,,
911,0.97,7747.639,7750.175,I appreciate your patience as I cover this.,133,,
912,0.97,7750.175,7756.815,"So as Councilmember mentioned, the committee has discussed this draft, or this legislation in committee before.",133,,
913,0.97,7756.815,7765.257,"The draft was discussed on May 24th with the current version of the Council bill that's in front of you, introduced on June 7th.",133,,
914,0.97,7765.257,7773.632,"Then in Committee on June 14th, you have a short discussion about changes in the substitute bill.",133,,
915,0.97,7773.632,7793.585,"As you've discussed, the intent is store the bill to create a different process through complaints that name the chief of police, given that the order unanimous ordinance from 2017, does not cover that.",133,,
916,0.97,7793.585,7799.124,"As mentioned, we're dropping with office of the inspector general.",133,,
917,0.97,7799.124,7807.566,"So the CPC also weighed in on the bill, and provided feedback, so the substitute impacts from all of those agencies.",133,,
918,0.97,7807.566,7817.442,"I'm going to go into a little detail about what the process is, and how it differs from the original bill as introduced.",133,,
919,0.97,7817.442,7827.152,"So the two major changes here are that the bill removes any collective bargaining language, since the chief of police is not Helicoptered.",133,,
920,0.97,7827.152,7840.832,"But in terms of the process, the biggest substantive change is moving away from how OPA usually handles complains in terms of Classificaton.",133,,
921,0.97,7840.832,7851.41,"So usually, when a complaint comes into OPA, it has to be classified within 30 days.",133,,
922,0.97,7851.41,7865.257,"We're looking at removing the 30 day time limit, so there wouldn't an limit in looking at which classification the complaint went into.",133,,
923,0.97,7865.257,7874.933,"So usually, with the OPA complaint, it could be a contact log, an investigation, and expedited investigation, or supervisor action.",133,,
924,0.97,7874.933,7891.95,"For the purposes of just informing the public, a contact log is basically when a complaint doesn't involve a violation.",133,,
925,0.97,7891.95,7899.258,"The complaint has already been Adjudicated, or back that are completely implausible and there's no other [inaudible] of misconduct.",133,,
926,0.97,7899.258,7908.734,"So you as I mentioned, the only two that would apply in this scenario are either the contact log or conduct the investigation.",133,,
927,0.97,7908.734,7915.874,"So neither the counted investigation, or the supervisor piece would be equitable.",133,,
928,0.97,7915.874,7924.416,"Both of those terms are stricken not only from the bill, but from the section 239- 900.",133,,
929,0.97,7924.416,7937.529,The section also removes a requirement that the chief be notified of the complaint.,133,,
930,0.97,7937.529,7944.136,"Instead, they must notify the inspector general.",133,,
931,0.97,7944.136,7971.763,"There's a new notification requirement to the President of the city Council, the chair of the public safety committee and the Complaintent, if the office of the inspector general determines the evaluation of the climb is taking an unnecessary amount of time, and I'll go into detail about what OPA is looking a the in the process in a moment.",133,,
932,0.97,7971.763,7978.603,"Upon the completion ever intake, a civilian supervisor investigator determines whether an investigation is warranted.",133,,
933,0.97,7978.603,7991.817,"In one of the things that the substitute adds is to having an interview before the process, if they desire that.",133,,
934,0.97,7991.817,8004.062,The next piece establishes sort of an overall consultative overall role for the office of the inspector general as the OPA is evaluating the complaint.,133,,
935,0.97,8004.062,8019.344,"So they're looking at both OPA's process, but also as to whether any laws or SPD policies would have been violated if the allegations are later proven to be true, or whether criminal charges could result if the alleged actions are later proven to be true.",133,,
936,0.97,8019.344,8032.257,"Those will come into play in a little bit here when we're talking about whether an investigation is warranted, and to whom that investigation goes to.",133,,
937,0.97,8032.257,8042.334,"If OPA does determine that an investigation is Insided, they'll evaluate whether they think it should be in the Department of human resources, or it should be an outside entity.",133,,
938,0.97,8042.334,8049.141,"And one of the things that OPA needed to consider, and document is whether there are any conflicts of interest.",133,,
939,0.97,8049.141,8060.619,"Whether there are real conflicts of interest, or even perceived that could potentially undermine the public trust if the investigation is conducted by OPA or hr.",133,,
940,0.97,8060.619,8071.496,"The next substantive session, I should is mentioned, all of these changes are reflected in Ann's memo on page 23.",133,,
941,0.97,8071.496,8074.399,That has a summary of what the changes are here.,133,,
942,0.97,8074.399,8090.082,"So in looking at the next section, which is .29520, this covers the office of Inspector general's role in reviewing OPA's process.",133,,
943,0.97,8090.082,8096.087,"In general here, if Oig disagrees with any of the decisions that OPA as made, the Oig decision controls.",133,,
944,0.97,8096.087,8111.603,"So as I go through the circumstances that arise here and in any of those circumstances, if there's any agreement, Oig is the determinant moving forward for that decision.",133,,
945,0.97,8111.603,8123.849,"Oig reviews the OPA intake to make sure both the intake and examination was timely and neutral, and if it concurs with that.",133,,
946,0.97,8123.849,8129.254,As I mentioned whether it should be in the contact Blog or investigation.,133,,
947,0.97,8129.254,8149.207,"If it turns out, Oga cannot determine whether the classification was timely thorough and neutral, or it disagrees with the classification, Oig must notify a group of public safety Stakeholders, which includes the Mayor, the chair of the public safety Committee, the exec fix director and Cochairs.",133,,
948,0.97,8149.207,8158.049,"The city attorney, the city director of human resources, and the Complaintent.",133,,
949,0.97,8158.049,8167.759,"I'll refer to that notification comes up in a couple of places here, I'll just refer to that in the future the Subset of public Stakeholders.",133,,
950,0.97,8167.759,8179.704,"If OPA has represented an investigation, Oig reviews the decision about who to give the investigation to, and this again, has to account for any potential or perceived conflict of interest.",133,,
951,0.97,8179.704,8186.678,"If Oig does agree that investigation is warranted, they will notify the chief that an investigation is needed.",133,,
952,0.97,8186.678,8192.651,So the notification into the chief doesn't happen until that investigation decision is made.,133,,
953,0.97,8192.651,8209.501,"If OPA determines that the investigation itself could result in a finding of violation of laws or policies that prohibit Harassment, or discrimination, Oig will review whether full investigation is warranted, and whether it concurs with OPA.",133,,
954,0.97,8209.501,8213.705,"Also, we'll look for a real or perceived conflict of interest.",133,,
955,0.97,8213.705,8226.251,"We'll consult with OPA, excuse me, to determine which Non-City entity should be in an investigation.",133,,
956,0.97,8226.251,8232.824,"After that consultation, only it will determine, and which Noncity entity should investigate.",133,,
957,0.97,8232.824,8246.304,"Lastly there if Oig thinks the investigation is to be connected by a Non-City entity, it will consult with OPA.",133,,
958,0.97,8246.304,8255.714,"After consultation, it's Oig's decision about how the investigation should be Manged, and which Non-City [inaudible] should investigate.",133,,
959,0.97,8255.714,8263.054,The next major section is about Notifications.,133,,
960,0.97,8263.054,8263.788,This is 3.295930.,133,,
961,0.97,8263.788,8279.537,"Oig is to notify, again, that Subset of public stake holders, who is going to conduct the investigation, or if it's a Non- city entity that's going to do it.",133,,
962,0.97,8279.537,8286.044,"In makes that decision, identified in subsection 540, there are a couple of requirements that are in the substitute.",133,,
963,0.97,8286.044,8291.383,"If ops a investigating, it must be by civilian personnel.",133,,
964,0.97,8291.383,8295.053,"If that can't happen, the complaint will go to a Non-City entity.",133,,
965,0.97,8295.053,8306.765,"As I mentioned before, if the investigation could result in finding a violation of our policies Shr can be assign today investigation.",133,,
966,0.97,8306.765,8309.701,Schr also has the and to decline that investigation.,133,,
967,0.97,8309.701,8324.949,"If that happens, then Oig Consults with OPA, as I mentioned before, to decide who should manage the contract and which Non-City entity, then it's OI G's sole decision about how those questions are answered after the investigation.",133,,
968,0.97,8324.949,8332.791,"If the investigation is of suspected violation of law, it will be referred to a Nonseattle law enforcement agency.",133,,
969,0.97,8332.791,8365.19,"Number general, with a Non-City entity that's conducting an investigation of any Non- criminal violations that name the chief that Non-City entity will not be a law enforcement agency, but if criminal charges could come, Oig will find both an appropriate and qualified law enforcement agency to investigate and the bill specifically mentioned this should be one with specific expertise for trust and transparency.",133,,
970,0.97,8365.19,8377.602,"With the powers, they are able to issue a subpoena either on behalf of OPA or a Non-City entity, but either way, Oig can subpoena the chief.",133,,
971,0.97,8377.602,8394.719,"And then the other piece of that is one of the nuances of this bill, if the complaint names the chief and the officer, the other officer, or other employee that is represented, two different processes go forward.",133,,
972,0.97,8394.719,8401.893,Regular OPA complaint process for the represented employee and this process in the bill for the chief.,133,,
973,0.97,8401.893,8412.237,"Far, a difference in terms of the chief's investigation is that there won't be any range of recommended discipline and the file itself will not go to the chief.",133,,
974,0.97,8412.237,8417.842,"I just want to note, I think that's an important change.",134,,
975,0.97,8417.842,8425.884,There's been some attention to three complaints against the former chief that have not been investigated.,134,,
976,0.97,8425.884,8433.892,There was a complaint about the decision to leave the East precinct in 2020.,134,,
977,0.97,8433.892,8440.732,That included both the chief and other SPD officers.,134,,
978,0.97,8440.732,8456.614,"And the result was that OPA did the investigation for the full complaint, and I think it's important when the chief of police is part of a complaint, that we have this process, so thank you for Uplifting that.",134,,
979,0.97,8456.614,8460.585,Absolutely.,135,,
980,0.97,8460.585,8475.333,"So once the investigation is completed, and I'm not at 3.2960 of the review, the inspector General will review if that complete investigation is timely and thorough.",135,,
981,0.97,8475.333,8486.444,"If they can't make the Democratic enacts, or the determination is that it wasn't timely, or thorough, they must notify the Subset of public safety Stakeholders mentioned previously.",135,,
982,0.97,8486.444,8499.457,"If Oig does find that the completed investigation was timely, thorough, and neutral, the OPA would submit the findings to the Mayor.",135,,
983,0.97,8499.457,8508.766,"If it is Sdhr, or a Non-City that is investigate, the Oig that will transmit the Investigational findings to the Mayor.",135,,
984,0.97,8508.766,8527.652,"Within 30 days of getting those results, the Mayor will communicate to that Subset of public safety Stakeholders a statement on the investigation in the findings and that would include whether the chief's actions were consistent with Department policy, the city values and SPD's values to protect and serve.",135,,
985,0.97,8527.652,8540.765,"It will notify outside of Stakeholders whether the Mayor intends to discharge the chief, or take Anier Explainary action against the chief, regardless Úof when that action would be final.",135,,
986,0.97,8540.765,8548.54,"It will provide detail that mirrors the detail that would be available to the public by OPA in a disclosed summary, disclosed action or other related report.",135,,
987,0.97,8548.54,8552.31,Those are the bulk of the changes in the substitute bill.,135,,
988,0.97,8552.31,8558.249,I can pause right now before getting into next steps if anybody has any questions.,135,,
989,0.97,8558.249,8563.988,"Not seeing any virtual raised hands, or in person.",136,,
990,0.97,8563.988,8564.355,"Go ahead, Asha.",136,,
991,0.97,8564.355,8565.623,"Okay, great.",137,,
992,0.97,8565.623,8576.334,"In that case as you mentioned chair Herbold, you can vote to replace the bill as introduced with the substitute portion and this would come back to committee July 12th.",137,,
993,0.97,8576.334,8584.575,"Between now and then, a you mentioned, we'll be reviewing to make sure all the technical Edits are connect, we didn't Miss any consequences.",137,,
994,0.97,8584.575,8597.989,There aren't any unresolved issues to the extend that Councilmembers want to propose any amendments we can work with you on those.,137,,
995,0.97,8597.989,8598.723,That would come on July 12th.,137,,
996,0.97,8598.723,8611.369,"You covered a lot of the changes without identifying who was the proponent of the change, and I didn't ask you to do that, so that's completely fine.",138,,
997,0.97,8611.369,8638.062,"I just wanted to lift up some of the things that the CPC was recommending as alterations, and we receive add letter from them, and I just wanted to sort of memorize the changes that included that we are stating explicitly that both intake and investigations conducted by OPA shall be conducted exclusively.",138,,
998,0.97,8638.062,8650.808,"That any Noncity entity investigating a discussion will not be a law enforcement agency, and that an investigation of the suspected violation of law will be investigated by a Non-City law enforcement agency.",138,,
999,0.97,8650.808,8660.418,"There are a couple of other changes as it relates to recitals, but those are the main substantive changes coming from the CPC that we worked to incorporate.",138,,
