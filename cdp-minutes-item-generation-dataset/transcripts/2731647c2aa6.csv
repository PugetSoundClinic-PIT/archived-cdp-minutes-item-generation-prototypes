21,0.97,143.51,166.933,I don't believe this bill has been introduced yet but we will have a briefing on it and the grants that the bills except will be related to the security missions and we will receive a second briefing at our next public safety committee meeting on March 22nd.,10,,

36,0.97,282.081,283.316,First we have Howard Gail.,10,,
37,0.97,283.316,296.796,Howard will be followed by Castil Hightower.,10,,
38,0.97,296.796,297.463,Good morning.,11,,
39,0.97,297.463,308.274,"The first agenda item is a discussion on the search process for the new OPA director . Yet, it is the Mayor that has complete control over the hiring, evaluation, and firing of the director.",11,,
40,0.97,308.274,326.159,"The last director, despite the long history of corruption--there is a brand-new publication revealing further evidence of corruption and and abuse of office.",11,,
41,0.97,326.159,335.635,"In the 20 years of the OPA existence, we have never had a fair and impartial director.",11,,
42,0.97,335.635,338.371,The Oig director actually does their job and is held accountable.,11,,
43,0.97,338.371,345.244,"The committee has complete control over the hiring, evaluation and firing of the Oig director.",11,,
44,0.97,345.244,360.46,"If the public safety committee will today discuss things that has no control over while continuing to ignore for an astounding seven month, the failures of the director that they have complete control over.",11,,
45,0.97,360.46,386.152,"Given the Whistleblowers, there are at least two Whistleblowers and it is critical for the public safety to protect us from another bad OPA director by immediately initiating an investigation of the current Oig director with public hearings and remove the current director if the allegations are found to have merit.",11,,
46,0.97,386.152,388.287,"Third, initiate the review of the entire police accountability systems.",11,,
47,0.97,388.287,395.828,This was outlined in the report of close to five years ago now and the report was never acted on.,11,,
48,0.97,395.828,400.833,That is better than trying to fix a system that is designed to fail.,11,,
49,0.97,400.833,405.505,We need to have police accountability that provides full community control over police.,11,,
50,0.97,405.505,409.776,Go to Seattle.Org to find out more.,11,,
51,0.97,409.776,420.219,"In the meantime, please do your duty and don't try to control things that you can't control but control the things that you can.",11,,
52,0.97,420.219,421.32,Thank you.,12,,
53,0.97,421.32,429.562,Our next Speaker is Castil Hightower and will be followed by Valerie Sheret.,12,,
54,0.97,429.562,435.735,"Hi, my name is Castil Hightower.",13,,
55,0.97,435.735,444.811,"In 2004, SPD shot and killed my brother . There is no justice and no accountability for his murder.",13,,
56,0.97,444.811,451.35,"In fact, the officer that killed him was rewarded instead of punished.",13,,
57,0.97,451.35,465.531,This is just a part of the long history of not holding people accountable.,13,,
58,0.97,466.666,468.034,There was another shooting just this morning.,13,,
59,0.97,468.034,483.316,"In the 20 years of OPA's existence, they have allowed complaints with flawed investigations.",13,,
60,0.97,485.351,491.123,The community at large continues to be put in harm's way.,13,,
61,0.97,491.123,502.435,The focus should not be on the new director but holding SPD accountable with several complaints.,13,,
62,0.97,502.435,507.24,They have failed to provide oversight.,13,,
63,0.97,515.581,527.26,There is one reference by Howard earlier in the first order of business should be caring about the safety of constituents rather than this.,13,,
64,0.97,527.26,528.928,Shame on you.,13,,
65,0.97,528.928,538.771,"While you continue to play politics, we continue to deal with the brutality that has harmed so many.",13,,
66,0.97,538.771,543.709,So few have been held accountable.,13,,
67,0.97,545.711,549.081,Thank you for your testimony.,14,,
68,0.97,549.081,561.394,Our next Speaker is Valerie Sheret and will be followed by David Hane.,14,,
69,0.97,561.394,568.401,"Good morning, my name is Valerie Sheret.",15,,
70,0.97,568.401,581.28,"The city council will have their presentation but according to the municipal code, we do not have the power for a new director.",15,,
71,0.97,581.28,594.36,The city council can hire or fire and to ensure that the investigation is conducted properly.,15,,
72,0.97,594.36,603.869,We all know there is widespread deception in the investigation.,15,,
73,0.97,603.869,622.722,We also know there are more complaints and they have not follow proper procedure.,15,,
74,0.97,642.942,646.512,This investigation is long overdue.,15,,
75,0.97,646.512,652.518,I hope it will have honest and accurate results.,15,,
76,0.97,652.518,661.193,We need a bureaucracy with accountability.,15,,
77,0.97,665.631,666.098,Thank you.,15,,
78,0.97,666.098,667.266,Thank you.,16,,
79,0.97,667.266,680.546,Next Speaker is David Hane and David will be followed by William Shane.,16,,
80,0.97,680.546,681.147,Thank you.,17,,
81,0.97,681.147,683.816,It is obvious that the police chief needs to be fired right away.,17,,
82,0.97,683.816,692.792,He still refuses to arrest drug pushers and criminal repeat offenders that destroy lives.,17,,
83,0.97,692.792,709.575,"Creating nonstop open job markets, selling stolen goods, selling strung out women traffic on the street, while the same cops I have known about third Avenue for 25 years allow it to get worse than ever before.",17,,
84,0.97,709.575,729.628,"Since the unwilling cops decided to sweep everyone out of one specific area, again after media reports, the same criminals took over Westlake Park, Pioneer square and Belltown again while cops refused to do anything.",17,,
85,0.97,729.628,743.175,We need to find out how many shootings have happened.,17,,
86,0.97,743.175,773.272,The cops are refusing to fight crime and are getting rich working overtime while only sweeping crime into parts of the city allowing a repeat of crimes to continue while the police chief keeps repeating himself since January and most with the help of Federal agencies because the cops are not qualified or trustworthy to fight crime but only respond in document and blame the homeless.,17,,
87,0.97,773.272,791.29,"Secondly, the human services Department should be moved to the homeless committee because it has become taken over by the most evil hypocrites, Prioritizing black and Brown criminals for something other than jail while innocent Law- abiding citizens don't get help.",17,,
88,0.97,791.29,796.729,Seattle human services Department is the epitome of racists.,17,,
89,0.97,796.729,801.4,Never judging character.,17,,
90,0.97,801.4,802.668,Thank you so much.,18,,
91,0.97,802.668,806.572,Our next Speaker is William Sim.,18,,
92,0.97,806.572,811.61,He is not showing present.,18,,
93,0.97,811.61,830.196,"So, with that, that was our last Speaker signed up for today and he is not showing present so we will give him one last call out.",18,,
94,0.97,830.196,831.597,He is not joining us.,18,,
95,0.97,831.597,833.899,"With that, we will close our public comment ..",18,,
96,0.97,833.899,836.869,Councilmember Lewis has joined the meeting.,18,,
97,0.97,836.869,839.471,Welcome.,18,,
98,0.97,846.912,853.786,"Oh, there you are, excellent.",18,,
99,0.97,853.786,859.925,"Do you mind reading this item into the agenda, please?",18,,
100,0.97,859.925,866.732,"Yes, committee agenda item number one, office of police accountability, director search process for briefing and discussion.",19,,
101,0.97,866.732,868.133,Thank you so much.,20,,
102,0.97,868.133,881.347,The 2017 accountability ordinance says the OPA director appointment at the end of a term or incumbents resignation.,20,,
103,0.97,881.347,897.663,"If the Mayor does not make an appointment or reappointment with 90 days of the first expiration of the term of a vacancy or reduction by the city Council, the committee shall appoint the director.",20,,
104,0.97,897.663,935.734,"The ordinance also says for appointments, the Mayor cell select from three qualified Finalists identified by the search committee through a process using the criteria in the community police Commission shall constitute at least 25% of the search committee and one of whom shall serve as one of the Cochairs and that the Mayor shall appoint from among the Finalists or initiate a new search and there should be input from the NBC and instructor general prior to appointments.",20,,
105,0.97,935.734,949.615,"So, this item that we have before us today is on the process for appointing a new director for the office of police accountability under the accountability ordinance.",20,,
106,0.97,949.615,951.884,The OPA director is appointed by the Mayor.,20,,
107,0.97,951.884,961.327,With the exception of if the appointment isn't within 90 days of the vacancy.,20,,
108,0.97,961.327,979.745,"It is truly important that the Mayor's office has a thorough search to provide flexibility with the Timeline and we are inviting the senior deputy, Monisha Harrell to this meeting and with that, I will turn things over to Monisha Harrell.",20,,
109,0.97,979.745,986.518,"Thank you so much, chair Herbold.",21,,
110,0.97,986.518,994.293,I am really thankful to be here again today.,21,,
111,0.97,994.293,1006.372,"So, by ordinance as you stipulated, we have 90 days to undergo a national process and bring a recommendation forward to Council.",21,,
112,0.97,1006.372,1018.217,"I think we all know that the office of police accountability is a tremendously important role, particularly the director leading that Department in this moment.",21,,
113,0.97,1018.217,1041.273,We wanted to be really thoughtful in how we did this search and wanted to be able to pull together an appropriate review committee and also to be able to handle all of the demands of a thorough process.,21,,
114,0.97,1041.273,1049.448,We have submitted an assessment of what we think is a workable Timeline for us.,21,,
115,0.97,1049.448,1055.287,There is always flexibility there if there is some feedback from Council.,21,,
116,0.97,1055.287,1066.865,"Around this Timeline, this is the plan that we would intend to adopt but certainly, we are open to feedback.",21,,
117,0.97,1066.865,1082.414,I will start with highlights which is that we would retain a search that does police accountability and policing searches deliberately.,21,,
118,0.97,1082.414,1087.052,Engaging those within the committee and have that committee be able to review and ratify a job description.,21,,
119,0.97,1087.052,1096.428,We know the job description used when we did this search last time might need a little bit of an adjustment with all of the things we know now.,21,,
120,0.97,1096.428,1106.371,We would then post the position and have about five weeks to be able to solicit people who would be interested in that role.,21,,
121,0.97,1106.371,1138.77,"It is almost a special Unicorn that we are looking for in this particular role because we do have a new landscape of accountability issues, both as a city and state and nationally that we are looking for and making sure that Whoever is selected to be the director of this rule really can uphold the trust and transparency that we want and demand from this particular position.",21,,
122,0.97,1138.77,1146.345,We would then interview four to six candidates from those that have applied.,21,,
123,0.97,1146.345,1160.659,They were be written assessment questions which we would make public to all that would want to see them as well as to the search committee.,21,,
124,0.97,1160.659,1171.703,"Then, after those interviews, one of the things that is a new element that we are modeling after some of the state advances is also doing social media searches.",21,,
125,0.97,1171.703,1190.889,"We are now asking our law enforcement officers to be free of bias and doing some of the social media searches, to ensure that we are getting the right character with this position and in the same way that we do the same scrutiny with our new recruits and officers.",21,,
126,0.97,1190.889,1195.661,This director would be under the same process.,21,,
127,0.97,1195.661,1198.964,"Of course, reference checks will be critical.",21,,
128,0.97,1198.964,1217.182,Both the ones that the candidate submits to us as well as those that we may reach out to to verify and this is a very important role so we want to make sure that there is a Holistic view of the accountability system.,21,,
129,0.97,1217.182,1226.625,Our goal would be to come back with a recommendation made by the Mayor by June 30th.,21,,
130,0.97,1226.625,1232.331,That is about three months from today.,21,,
131,0.97,1232.331,1237.469,"With that, I will open it up to any questions.",21,,
132,0.97,1237.469,1240.339,Thank you so much.,22,,
133,0.97,1240.339,1241.773,"Jake, over to you.",22,,
134,0.97,1241.773,1256.555,I just want to mention folks that I had spoken to the Mayor's office about the process and we jointly assessed that the committee briefing would be helpful before moving forward.,22,,
135,0.97,1256.555,1267.199,I am working to figure out how to Memorialize the intent to allow some time and to ensure that we are not raising any issues with accountability.,22,,
136,0.97,1271.303,1288.12,We have consulted the city attorney's office and I think the plan is at the next meeting that I will be proposing that we vote on a clerk file to show agreement with this Timeline.,22,,
137,0.97,1288.12,1307.306,I really appreciate the Mayor for flagging this early and recognizing the importance of this role and the need to be collaborative and involved.,22,,
138,0.97,1307.306,1336.134,"Also, we appreciate that within the process itself, you are including reviewing the job description should there be intention from the search committee or other individuals who augment the job Descripton . that is very helpful.",22,,
139,0.97,1336.134,1424.923,I have a few more questions but I will just pause and see if my colleagues have that will be W the candidates are bringing forward to interview.,22,,
140,0.97,1424.923,1438.236,We will bring forward to interview the four to six in the selections that we will recommend to the Mayor.,22,,
141,0.97,1438.236,1442.474,We will keep this committee updated.,22,,
142,0.97,1448.313,1456.454,After the interviews of those four to six candidates.,22,,
143,0.97,1456.454,1478.443,"One last point that I want to flag, I want to identify that the community police Commission shall be 25% and I see that flag in your description provided for the committee.",23,,
144,0.97,1478.443,1493.592,It also requires one extra requirement so I just want to flag that as well.,23,,
145,0.97,1504.469,1516.448,We always look forward to working with Council to make sure that we have a process that includes the entire body and legislative executive and accountability partners.,24,,
146,0.97,1516.448,1523.421,Thank you.,25,,
147,0.97,1523.421,1534.366,I will wait to be invited but I think you know,25,,
148,0.97,1731.162,1736.768,We have come to build 220117 and it would appropriate 1.3 million for two grants that would go to SPD.,26,,
149,0.97,1736.768,1747.479,"These grants were received late in 2021, in December after the Council had already appropriated and adopted the 2022 budget.",26,,
150,0.97,1747.479,1772.971,"The city would normally have handled these grants in the fourth quarter Subliminal budget but during the process of moving to the midyear process, there was a gap created and these two particular grants fall into that gap and need to be appropriated now as Stand-Alone legislation.",26,,
151,0.97,1772.971,1785.083,Cbo and central staff are in discussions about how to handle the gradients that fall into this gap on a citywide basis.,26,,
152,0.97,1785.083,1791.055,"Hopefully, this is something that is a one time event here with these particular grants.",26,,
153,0.97,1791.055,1799.998,"At a high level, one of them is for 575,000 and comes from the office of criminal justice in the Quincy program.",26,,
154,0.97,1799.998,1809.674,The purpose is for continuing the work of the Northwest regional Internet crimes against children task force.,26,,
155,0.97,1809.674,1813.945,It is a Federal grant that runs from October of last year to September of this year.,26,,
156,0.97,1813.945,1822.453,"The other one is for 750,000 and it comes from the office of victims of crimes from DOJ.",26,,
157,0.97,1822.453,1835.834,It is to continue the work of the human trafficking task force and that is on the Federal fiscal year of October of last year and to September of this year.,26,,
158,0.97,1835.834,1839.103,It is because they are on the Federal fiscal years that it falls into that gap.,26,,
159,0.97,1839.103,1848.079,That does not really work for the supplemental but hopefully that is something that Ceo and central staff can address.,26,,
160,0.97,1848.079,1855.854,"With that, I will turn over to Brian Maxey and Todd Kibbee.",26,,
161,0.97,1855.854,1858.389,"Thank you so much, Greg.",27,,
162,0.97,1858.389,1871.069,"I am sorry, my agenda shows that you are up for the next item and not for this item so my apologies.",27,,
163,0.97,1871.069,1873.137,"No problem, thanks for having me here.",28,,
164,0.97,1873.137,1882.18,"Too so, I will briefly address these.",28,,
165,0.97,1882.18,1884.883,I think the introduction was pretty comprehensive about what these things are.,28,,
166,0.97,1884.883,1895.593,"These are two grants that have regional impacts and in particular, the crimes against children grant is managed by the police Department as a regional resource.",28,,
167,0.97,1895.593,1905.503,It actually provides funding to support activities of many departments across the state.,28,,
168,0.97,1905.503,1922.52,"In particular, it is the Northwest regional Internet crimes against children task force which really focuses on technology facilitated child expectation and this is a major issue.",28,,
169,0.97,1922.52,1926.391,"It has been a growing concern, the number of cases that have been climbing rapidly over the last few years.",28,,
170,0.97,1926.391,1938.069,The purpose of this money is that it funds one full-time program manager to coordinate these efforts and supports the purchase of equipment and ongoing training of police detectives in the areas of technology and Forensics.,28,,
171,0.97,1938.069,1948.246,This is an extremely complicated area of investigations because it is so Technology-Based and those Technologies are rapidly developing.,28,,
172,0.97,1948.246,1964.329,The coordination of these efforts in staying on top of technologies and strategies for exploiting these children is critical to combating those horrors.,28,,
173,0.97,1964.329,1990.755,"As noted, the funding for this has been handled in the fourth quarter Subliminal of last year and that means we have a lot of work with a lot of agencies across the state that are continuing to combat child exploitation that we need to hopefully get the money as quickly as possible so we can distribute it out and support their efforts.",28,,
174,0.97,1990.755,2003.301,I know everyone is continuing to work and no one has stopped but there is a funding gap that we want to resolve as quickly as possible.,28,,
175,0.97,2003.301,2026.09,"On human trafficking grants, this provides funding for the continuation of the task force and this also funds one Fpe labor trafficking detectives and overtime for detectives, and Ministry of services, evaluation purchase of equipment training, and supplies to combat human trafficking.",28,,
176,0.97,2026.09,2040.671,"Again, similar to the grant, this would normally have been resolved in the fourth quarter Subliminal but we find ourselves trying to fill the gap here and really ask for this bodies support in moving forward.",28,,
177,0.97,2040.671,2040.972,Thank you.,28,,
178,0.97,2040.972,2043.908,Thank you.,29,,
179,0.97,2043.908,2048.413,These are jurisdictional Taskforces.,29,,
180,0.97,2048.413,2057.855,"If you have the information, can you just say which jurisdictions are a part of each task force?",29,,
181,0.97,2057.855,2062.76,I don't have that information for human trafficking grants.,30,,
182,0.97,2062.76,2065.797,I can get it . standby.,30,,
183,0.97,2065.797,2076.074,"Internet crimes against children, the way the funding is distributed is you have the Washington State patrol and it has its own body and funding.",30,,
184,0.97,2076.074,2084.048,"This is the entirety of the rest of the state so many, many jurisdictions happened in this funding.",30,,
185,0.97,2084.048,2097.128,"And, are there outcomes support associated with these bodies of work?",31,,
186,0.97,2097.128,2100.264,I am just assuming since these are grant sources and there is some sort of --,31,,
187,0.97,2100.264,2113.778,"Yes, that is what the immunization goes to, to coordinate the resources and track how it is being distributed and to account for those distributions.",32,,
188,0.97,2113.778,2125.523,"Yeah, I think it would be helpful before Monday, if possible if there is a short summary.",33,,
189,0.97,2125.523,2133.331,For the outcomes associated with the prior years grant funding.,33,,
190,0.97,2133.331,2148.146,To give you a better sense of not just how these dollars are used but to what result.,33,,
191,0.97,2155.052,2156.521,"Understood, we can get that to you.",34,,
192,0.97,2156.521,2156.921,Super.,35,,
193,0.97,2156.921,2164.061,I have no additional questions.,35,,
194,0.97,2164.061,2168.599,Any questions from any of my colleagues?,35,,
195,0.97,2168.599,2169.0,Great.,35,,
196,0.97,2169.0,2195.126,"Just one more thing for Greg, you had mentioned that something was going to be changed in the budget process this year that we won't have a situation where we are voting on grants that started back in October and can you just describe that again?",35,,
197,0.97,2195.126,2196.227,What is the change?,35,,
198,0.97,2196.227,2204.535,"I should be clear, the central staff are talking about how to handle this.",36,,
199,0.97,2204.535,2211.943,There is no specific process change that has been proposed yet.,36,,
200,0.97,2211.943,2227.658,"If it is just these two grants, maybe it will be the case where these grants will come forward again but I suspect that there are other city grants that fall into the Federal funding cycle that might need a similar approach.",36,,
201,0.97,2227.658,2239.537,That is something that the Finance director and our budget director here on central staff needs to figure out and needs to determine how to fix.,36,,
202,0.97,2239.537,2245.643,That is something that they will come back to you in the Finance chair later with a specific proposal.,36,,
203,0.97,2245.643,2249.714,Thank you so much.,37,,
204,0.97,2249.714,2264.662,"All right, not seeing any additional questions or comments, with that, I will move on to bill 1202 77.",37,,
205,0.97,2264.662,2265.262,Is there a second?,37,,
206,0.97,2265.262,2266.364,Second.,38,,
207,0.97,2266.364,2271.202,Any other comments on the bill?,39,,
208,0.97,2271.202,2289.52,"Hearing no further comments, again, thank you for being with us here today and sharing with us the contents of this bill and the need for our support moving forward.",39,,
209,0.97,2289.52,2292.39,While the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill?,39,,
210,0.97,2292.39,2292.957,Councilmember Mosqueda.,40,,

219,0.97,2311.242,2311.842,Yes.,49,,
220,0.97,2311.842,2313.077,That is five in favor.,50,,
221,0.97,2313.077,2314.111,Thank you so much.,51,,
222,0.97,2314.111,2320.017,The motion carries in the can you recommend that the bill passes and the bill will be forwarded to the March 15th council meeting.,51,,
223,0.97,2320.017,2322.353,While the clerk please read and agenda item number three?,51,,
224,0.97,2322.353,2329.26,"Agenda item number three, council bill 120280.",52,,
225,0.97,2329.26,2338.002,"An ordinance relating to the 2020 budget, amending ordinance 126490 which adopted the 2022 budget.",52,,
226,0.97,2338.002,2347.111,"Changing appropriations to various departments and budget control levels, and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",52,,
227,0.97,2347.111,2348.145,Thank you very much.,53,,
228,0.97,2348.145,2353.25,This will be a first briefing about the security initiative and the grant.,53,,
229,0.97,2353.25,2363.327,"We are joined again by the officer, Brian Maxey and Todd Kibbee, again.",53,,
230,0.97,2363.327,2373.337,Thank you for joining us and for the additional intent for the next committee.,53,,
231,0.97,2373.337,2380.945,"Greg, would you mind introducing this item and that we will hand it over to Brian.",53,,
232,0.97,2380.945,2389.72,"Yes, council bill 120280 would have to $.3 million in funding from the U.S.",54,,
233,0.97,2389.72,2403.901,"Department of homeland security for the urban area security initiative grant program and that is by way of background, the city received approximately $3 million in funds last fall.",54,,
234,0.97,2403.901,2415.312,The Council accepted all of those funds in ordinance 126469 which passed with the 2022 adopted budget on November 22nd.,54,,
235,0.97,2415.312,2437.301,"The adopted budget included a $750,000 appropriation for the Seattle fire Department's share of the board but it did not include the SPD share which is the $2.3 million that is in the bill before you today.",54,,
236,0.97,2437.301,2454.685,"At the time, it was a decision of the Finance chair to hold off on appropriating the balance of the award to SPD until the members of this committee could conduct a more analysis of how SPD would intend to spend the funds.",54,,
237,0.97,2454.685,2456.353,That brings us to the bill before you today.,54,,
238,0.97,2456.353,2466.831,Spd has provided information on the specific equipment and purchases that it would use the $2.2 million for.,54,,
239,0.97,2466.831,2499.163,There was a list of equipment projects in the distributions of the funds or any other questions that you might have about the program.,54,,
240,0.97,2501.232,2506.971,Thank you so much.,55,,
241,0.97,2506.971,2514.945,Let's now hear from Brian Maxey and Todd Kibbee.,55,,
242,0.97,2514.945,2515.813,"Thank you, Councilmember.",56,,
243,0.97,2515.813,2530.127,I will just start with a high level description of the grant and how it is being used by the regional partners in combating terrorism in emergency situations.,56,,
244,0.97,2530.127,2543.607,This is part of a coordinated effort to provide resources both for emergency management and law enforcement throughout the region.,56,,
245,0.97,2543.607,2570.968,"Although SPD is the managing agency and we are the ones that administer this grant, we are not the recipients that are discussed in the ordinance and it is part of the materials as attachment A. we have a listing of the projects in the intended beneficiaries of each of the items on that list.",56,,
246,0.97,2570.968,2585.349,"The concept here behind the grant is that it is to assist a high threat, high density urban area to build and sustain and deliver capabilities necessary to prevent and protect against mitigated responses for terrorism.",56,,
247,0.97,2585.349,2611.275,"While a lot of the items are focused on terrorism being the instigating event that requires emergency management services in the use of the items here, they are applicable to a wide range of actual ask whether those are Human-Caused or naturally occurring.",56,,
248,0.97,2611.275,2628.325,"The grant funds program management and Sustainment citizen preparedness and outreach contract, equipment training to respond, mass care shelter planning, this is really a mechanism by which the region comes together.",56,,
249,0.97,2628.325,2645.576,"They Prioritize by means of the board, those resources that are necessary to stabilize the region for the potential of mass casualty events.",56,,
250,0.97,2645.576,2647.511,This is why this funding is so important.,56,,
251,0.97,2647.511,2650.948,It has been brought before city council for quite some time.,56,,
252,0.97,2650.948,2664.828,"We strongly request--I realize there will not be a vote today but as you move forward with this, this body needs to support getting resources to our region.",56,,
253,0.97,2664.828,2674.204,I will pass it off to Todd Kibbee for any statements he has or specific questions about any of the items.,56,,
254,0.97,2674.204,2679.543,"Thank you, Brian.",57,,
255,0.97,2679.543,2684.548,I think I will just reiterate the fact that this is a collaborative effort amongst agencies from the county.,57,,
256,0.97,2684.548,2693.657,The law enforcement have members from all agencies throughout the region.,57,,
257,0.97,2693.657,2702.699,We intend to identify gaps in our response capabilities and invest those through the funding of this grant.,57,,
258,0.97,2702.699,2722.352,"The Interoperability of all of these resources is a key aspect of our choosing of what makes the cut for this grant and the collaboration and cooperation amongst all law enforcement agencies along with the fire service and fire Department in emergency management, that is what makes this grant really special.",57,,
259,0.97,2722.352,2729.66,We are all thinking in terms of what will help the region.,57,,
260,0.97,2729.66,2738.669,We try to not get bogged down but it is more of a cooperation amongst all of the agencies to further our efforts in response to terrorism events in our region.,57,,
261,0.97,2738.669,2743.373,"With that, we will pause for any questions.",57,,
262,0.97,2746.944,2751.648,Thank you so much . Greg?,58,,
263,0.97,2751.648,2752.716,"Thank you, Madam chair.",59,,
264,0.97,2752.716,2771.969,"I just wanted to clarify that in any discussion or comments that I might present next week on this bill, I will not have knowledge of the specific projects that I will be able to impart to Councilmembers.",59,,
265,0.97,2771.969,2783.881,"If there are questions now about what options the Council might take regarding the bill or legal or legislative options, I will have those.",59,,
266,0.97,2783.881,2810.374,"If there are follow-up questions that need to be answered, I can certainly do that but I want to encourage committee members to ask any questions that they have about the technical aspects of these projects and the security aspects of the assistant chief and Mr. Maxey as they are the knowledge experts and specifically in the homeland security area.",59,,
267,0.97,2810.374,2814.444,Thank you.,60,,
268,0.97,2814.444,2820.584,There is a project list of approximately 14 projects here.,60,,
269,0.97,2820.584,2829.193,"What I hear you saying, Greg, is that this is the time to ask questions about those projects.",60,,
270,0.97,2829.193,2829.56,Absolutely.,61,,
271,0.97,2829.56,2857.754,"My speaking point, I have set a couple of times that you are going to be giving a presentation of your memo at my next meeting on the 22nd but I think your memo is dated today and there are some things in that memo that maybe we want to highlight now in preparation for the 22nd.",62,,
272,0.97,2857.754,2870.3,"Yeah, I think what I would highlight is mostly around legislative process.",63,,
273,0.97,2870.3,2884.648,"That the legislation itself includes in the title, the word that would allow some flexibility of the committee to condition projects or finding.",63,,
274,0.97,2884.648,2887.351,"However, that can be tricky.",63,,
275,0.97,2887.351,2920.45,"Mr. Maxey can talk about how if the Council chose to condition projects or funding that could affect the grant or could affect the partnered jurisdictions, that is something that potentially we might not need to get to unless the Council chose to go that route and",63,,
276,0.97,3186.283,3188.718,Thank you so much.,64,,
277,0.97,3188.718,3197.327,I wanted to get clear direction to go ahead and ask a handful of questions.,64,,
278,0.97,3197.327,3211.808,"I do have a handful so I am wondering if you want me to go through them and as you see other hands come up, feel free to interrupt me but I do have a full list compared to the grid here.",64,,
279,0.97,3211.808,3214.344,This shows the investment in the title and the total.,64,,
280,0.97,3231.361,3234.297,"As you are doing that, most of these questions are for future consideration.",65,,
281,0.97,3234.297,3242.639,I am not necessarily making a suggestion.,65,,
282,0.97,3242.639,3248.979,"I will just walk through the questions if that sounds good, Madam chair.",65,,
283,0.97,3248.979,3253.717,We have to do a dual screen here because it is hard for me to see.,65,,
284,0.97,3253.717,3255.085,Wonderful.,65,,
285,0.97,3255.085,3278.108,"On Seattle USA I, for $245,000, can you share details on what kind of projects this would coordinate and what is the Seattle Usai and SPR?",65,,
286,0.97,3280.243,3286.383,I can take that.,66,,
287,0.97,3286.383,3305.835,"So, there is an identification and risk assessment that is done through the region and is basically there to identify hazards and gaps in our response.",66,,
288,0.97,3305.835,3317.18,That report is generated . There is thoughts of collaboration and meetings that go along with that report.,66,,
289,0.97,3317.18,3320.05,That is generated through our partners at FEMA for our region.,66,,
290,0.97,3320.05,3332.629,A lot of the grants and requests for the exhibitors are based on that risk assessment.,66,,
291,0.97,3332.629,3338.735,"The 240,000 that you are looking at is part of that development.",66,,
292,0.97,3349.612,3360.457,"Okay, let's move on to the Seattle Usai security needs for 124,000.",67,,
293,0.97,3360.457,3365.328,Can you talk a little bit more about where this position would be housed?,67,,
294,0.97,3365.328,3371.701,It is right after the first one.,68,,
295,0.97,3371.701,3375.772,The first one is planning and the next one is staff.,68,,
296,0.97,3375.772,3380.643,Thank you.,69,,
297,0.97,3380.643,3388.852,"Law enforcement program manager, where this position would be held.",69,,
298,0.97,3388.852,3392.555,"I'm sorry, okay.",70,,
299,0.97,3392.555,3395.592,"So, SPD has this regional Law- enforcement program manager.",70,,
300,0.97,3395.592,3428.491,"They are an employee and we have a new employee that just started in January . They took over this program and they are a SPD employee and their job is to reach out among all that jurisdictions and deliver equipment as we discussed earlier, SPD, we get all of the equipment in through our Department and this person basically distributes it out to Auburn and ever and everything else.",70,,
301,0.97,3428.491,3435.498,They are also involved in the planning and all of the different Subcommittees.,70,,
302,0.97,3435.498,3442.305,They are housed as a city employee.,70,,
303,0.97,3442.305,3442.939,Thank you.,71,,
304,0.97,3442.939,3451.714,"Just for orientation, the first six lines of this chart are the same program, just different elements of the program.",71,,
305,0.97,3451.714,3457.72,"If we can walk through that, that is great.",72,,
306,0.97,3457.72,3463.026,Are they coordinating with other jurisdictions that do interact with I.C.E.,72,,
307,0.97,3463.026,3465.562,For example?,72,,
308,0.97,3465.562,3477.64,I don't know what jurisdictions just what the level of cooperation with Federal partners are or Federal agencies so I cannot answer that specifically.,73,,
309,0.97,3477.64,3491.487,These are grant proposals that have gone through the subcommittee . I don't know how to answer that question.,73,,
310,0.97,3491.487,3497.06,Each jurisdiction has their own policies.,73,,
311,0.97,3497.06,3498.928,"So, I cannot answer that right now.",73,,
312,0.97,3498.928,3532.528,You can speak to the fact that Seattle resources are being used in a way that is consistent with Seattle's don't ask ordinance and that the resources are not being used to inquire people's immigration status except for in circumstances--the narrow circumstance that the ordinance allows.,74,,
313,0.97,3532.528,3533.796,"I can speak for Seattle, yes.",75,,
314,0.97,3533.796,3548.478,"As far as other agencies, I don't have control over the policies.",75,,
315,0.97,3549.078,3549.646,Thank you.,76,,
316,0.97,3549.646,3551.915,Let me just jump in on that one point.,77,,
317,0.97,3551.915,3565.528,You are absolutely correct that one of the ordinances that was passed a few years ago and SPD policy prohibits any SPD engagement on Taskforces that are doing any kind of immigration enforcement with the rare exception of some aspects of human trafficking that were carved out on that.,77,,
318,0.97,3565.528,3574.804,"Yes, no participation by Seattle employees . any kind of enforcement is occurring.",77,,
319,0.97,3574.804,3578.107,Thank you.,78,,
320,0.97,3578.107,3583.112,I just want to invite other questions from additional Councilmembers.,78,,
321,0.97,3583.112,3590.086,I want to make sure before--I know Councilmember Mosqueda you have other questions.,78,,
322,0.97,3590.086,3595.491,Do you have others related to the first six items which are all the same program?,78,,
323,0.97,3595.491,3598.361,I do.,79,,
324,0.97,3598.361,3600.229,I can hold those --,79,,
325,0.97,3600.229,3621.05,"Why don't you finish your questions about the first six items which are all the same program and then, Councilmember Lewis, if you have questions as well, I will turn to you.",80,,
326,0.97,3621.05,3622.118,"Thank you, Madam chair.",81,,
327,0.97,3622.118,3640.169,"Skipping to item number four with regional enhancement for 175,000, can you confirm that these are essentially just shields where an officer would use in an active shooter situation?",81,,
328,0.97,3643.906,3648.911,"That is the intent, yes.",82,,
329,0.97,3651.914,3662.358,There is a shield used in many situations for officer safety and rescue situations and to protect firefighters in certain situations.,82,,
330,0.97,3662.358,3671.1,The intent is to use those upper active responses.,82,,
331,0.97,3671.1,3674.837,"If it is there, you can use it.",82,,
332,0.97,3674.837,3690.186,We definitely have experienced shield being used against protesters so I just wanted to confirm what type of purchase this was for.,83,,
333,0.97,3690.186,3702.932,The active shooter scenario is the primary use for these shields.,84,,
334,0.97,3702.932,3732.528,"If I may also respond very quickly, these shields, the two that are being retained by the police Department, these are not ones that are typically used in any sort of demonstration but these are different rated and I believe one is handgun rated and one is ballistic rated.",85,,
335,0.97,3732.528,3752.715,"While we would use this in active shooter situations, we would also train the use of these shields for edge weapon engagement and other times where officers need to be protected in order to advance on a person in crisis if they are armed.",85,,
336,0.97,3752.715,3762.191,It is not solely for active shooter but also other tactical engagements where the officers need engagement.,85,,
337,0.97,3762.191,3770.5,These are solely defensive items and way too heavy to be used in an offensive manner.,85,,
338,0.97,3770.5,3776.906,"Okay, thank you.",86,,
339,0.97,3776.906,3782.678,"On the regional screening search, the detection for 100,000.",86,,
340,0.97,3782.678,3790.219,What are the specialized tactical tools and in what situations are they used?,86,,
341,0.97,3796.125,3822.852,"So, the tools are essentially a way for us to keep our human officers and give them distance and shielding in tactical situations instead of having an officer having to approach to open a door to get a view into a room or something like that.",87,,
342,0.97,3822.852,3838.968,We can use these robots in the technology to do that for us so that we don't have to expose an officer to anything inside the building.,87,,
343,0.97,3838.968,3855.585,It addresses a gap in our response and allows us to go up to a door inside a building and not have a human officer they are in a potential for confrontation is not there as well.,87,,
344,0.97,3855.585,3867.964,It addresses a gap to give us a way to see what is in the building without actually having to risk an officer doing that themselves.,87,,
345,0.97,3867.964,3869.966,I will just jump in as well.,88,,
346,0.97,3869.966,3880.576,I believe they were speaking to item 14 which is the tactical preaching robot.,88,,
347,0.97,3880.576,3881.41,"Oh, I'm sorry.",89,,
348,0.97,3881.41,3885.982,This particular item is the breaching kits that are used anytime there is a Barricaded door.,90,,
349,0.97,3885.982,3888.251,To force entry into that.,90,,
350,0.97,3888.251,3900.162,That would only be used when there is a warrant and a need to enter a building for some purpose.,90,,
351,0.97,3900.162,3909.305,This is subject to both legal and policy considerations that the deployment can use.,90,,
352,0.97,3909.305,3916.879,"As you can see, SPD will retain 10 of these kids in the other 40 are distributed among regional partners.",90,,
353,0.97,3916.879,3920.816,"Great, thank you, Madam chair.",91,,
354,0.97,3920.816,3923.085,These are all of my questions for the section.,91,,
355,0.97,3923.085,3929.959,"Great, Councilmember Lewis, do you have questions for the section?",92,,
356,0.97,3929.959,3942.505,"Yes, the question about the employee which was the first one, there was a comment about year after year so that me wonder and this is an ongoing program.",93,,
357,0.97,3942.505,3952.982,Every year we get a grant--can you give me more background about this actual program?,93,,
358,0.97,3952.982,3954.417,That is all I wanted to know.,93,,
359,0.97,3954.417,3966.362,I just wanted to know if this is the first time we are considering the projects with this grant?,93,,
360,0.97,3966.362,3973.002,I don't have the start date of this but it has been around for many many years.,94,,
361,0.97,3973.002,3982.445,"Every year, we come before Council with the appropriations and the receipt of the money, initially.",94,,
362,0.97,3982.445,4000.396,"The project list from Year-To- year, differs depending on the needs and that is decided by emergency operations and this is a FEMA grants.",94,,
363,0.97,4000.396,4012.508,"The position of the law enforcement management, we have ongoing authority from the Council for that vision itself and the Sicily the funding for that position.",94,,
364,0.97,4012.508,4021.25,Thank you.,95,,
365,0.97,4021.25,4029.625,I had one question that relates to this item for security needs . as well as several of the others.,95,,
366,0.97,4029.625,4038.734,I am just going to ask now and get out of the way and I think it will be the same regardless of what program it relates to.,95,,
367,0.97,4038.734,4063.059,"Several of the items state that Technologies themselves meet criteria for being subject to review by Council under the surveillance ordinance and for SPD policy, that was a different--that refers to a search warrant.",95,,
368,0.97,4063.059,4090.386,"Per city policy, certain Technologies have to go through surveillance review and that has to be approved by Council before the purchase is made and there are several items and how are we handling that?",95,,
369,0.97,4090.386,4114.343,I know there is a backlog of SPD technology that have not yet received a review . are we approving this appropriation with the understanding that we are not going to spend the money until after the review occurs.,95,,
370,0.97,4114.343,4121.317,"So, for each piece of technology, we have have a policy report.",96,,
371,0.97,4121.317,4130.993,There is nothing about this grant or preparation back gets us past the requirements of the surveillance ordinance so we will be in full compliance with that.,96,,
372,0.97,4130.993,4134.196,We write the privacy impact as reported and when Seattle I.T.,96,,
373,0.97,4134.196,4151.38,"Has the ordinance, that is by Seattle but will they have additional privacy concerns or questions and submit full surveillance impact reports and go through the full council review process?",96,,
374,0.97,4151.38,4155.851,That will need to be done depending on what the I.T.,96,,
375,0.97,4155.851,4198.16,"Assessment is in for the ordinance, we are not able to spend that purchase until we go to the privacy review in this grant go through December of 23 and getting access and approval for the funds for those processes in getting the appropriation done sooner rather than later and that will be in that.",96,,
376,0.97,4198.16,4201.664,Thank you.,97,,
377,0.97,4201.664,4218.847,I just wanted to make sure that was not going to happen before so thank you.,97,,
378,0.97,4218.847,4223.953,The only thing I would put out that I don't know the answer to is purchasing for other jurisdictions where it is a Pass-Through.,98,,
379,0.97,4223.953,4232.695,They are not subject to the processes and I would think that would go for a follow-up.,98,,
380,0.97,4232.695,4236.565,I would expect that as well.,99,,
381,0.97,4236.565,4239.234,They don't have as stringent of a process.,99,,
382,0.97,4239.234,4253.215,I don't think we would want to interfere or limit the use of funds that they are entitled to receive based on that.,99,,
383,0.97,4253.215,4269.064,The next category of items is how many of these are related to the category of the National authority projects.,99,,
384,0.97,4269.064,4281.877,"We have several of these and if you have questions, let me know.",99,,
385,0.97,4281.877,4282.945,"I do, Madam chair.",100,,
386,0.97,4282.945,4285.347,Thank you for encouraging us to ask these questions.,100,,
387,0.97,4285.347,4293.489,We can have the content experts on the line with us.,100,,
388,0.97,4293.489,4304.433,"Scrolling back up to the National priority projects, I will go through line 2 for the fusion center Sustainment.",100,,
389,0.97,4304.433,4316.979,Language says it prohibits agents from contacting order regarding the nationals.,100,,
390,0.97,4316.979,4318.414,I appreciate that being called out.,100,,
391,0.97,4318.414,4330.326,The questions I do have are what are the four focus areas that are mentioned for the analyst and does the entity communicate directly?,100,,
392,0.97,4338.067,4339.802,I will have to look up the four.,101,,
393,0.97,4339.802,4342.004,"If you give me a second, I can do that.",101,,
394,0.97,4342.004,4343.605,They don't have any direct contact with I.C.E.,101,,
395,0.97,4343.605,4354.65,Their job is to bring in information and distribute it as opposed to the other way around.,101,,
396,0.97,4354.65,4357.686,I can find out those four things for you.,101,,
397,0.97,4357.686,4364.893,Just one minute.,101,,
398,0.97,4364.893,4375.304,"Let me fill the air, let's say.",102,,
399,0.97,4375.304,4377.506,I can go to the next one if you prefer.,103,,
400,0.97,4377.506,4378.507,That works.,104,,
401,0.97,4378.507,4390.185,"Great, we have extremism regional tactic awareness kit for 75,000.",105,,
402,0.97,4390.185,4400.062,"Do you mind giving us a few examples of the type of Open- source background information, this would give users access to and what situations would this be needed in?",105,,
403,0.97,4416.278,4416.712,I apologize.,106,,
404,0.97,4416.712,4417.78,Which line are we on?,106,,
405,0.97,4417.78,4420.115,"Sorry, just right below the domestic violence extremism.",107,,
406,0.97,4420.115,4425.721,It is the attack software.,108,,
407,0.97,4435.364,4436.231,"I'm sorry, your question?",109,,
408,0.97,4436.231,4436.665,I apologize.,109,,
409,0.97,4436.665,4438.901,"No worries, I did have a few of them.",110,,
410,0.97,4438.901,4445.174,I am also wondering if I should submit these but it is really nice to be able to walk through.,110,,
411,0.97,4445.174,4446.341,Thank you for your time.,110,,
412,0.97,4446.341,4464.259,"I'm wondering if you give examples of the background information to give users access and what situations this would be needed for . Also, if you have any Intel on how this type of technology is directed by any SPD policies.",110,,
413,0.97,4464.259,4472.701,"Obviously, in regards to the policies, we would have to adhere to the current ones with the surveillance ordinance.",111,,
414,0.97,4472.701,4485.047,"Basically, the open source--my understanding is it has more to do with the Regionwide so that we can monitor other jurisdictions.",111,,
415,0.97,4485.047,4493.722,Seattle would have that with Everett and things of that nature.,111,,
416,0.97,4493.722,4495.557,That is my understanding.,111,,
417,0.97,4495.557,4499.795,I would have to research further.,111,,
418,0.97,4499.795,4507.803,It might be helpful if you gave an overview of what this system is.,112,,
419,0.97,4507.803,4526.021,"Basically, all of the jurisdictions in the area tend to have different radio frequencies and different software that they use for dispatch and everything else.",113,,
420,0.97,4526.021,4532.928,This is an attempt to give us all--to be on the same page operationally communication wise.,113,,
421,0.97,4532.928,4534.496,That is essentially what it boils down to.,113,,
422,0.97,4534.496,4541.236,We have the same training and we train with the fire Department and bring emergency management folks.,113,,
423,0.97,4541.236,4548.644,Everyone has a common operating picture for any attack or natural disaster.,113,,
424,0.97,4548.644,4552.547,That is essentially what this is.,113,,
425,0.97,4552.547,4559.354,It is to bring all of the platforms together so that we can talk to each other and function as a coherent team.,113,,
426,0.97,4559.354,4567.696,Is this used to monitor other private or public organizations or strictly for Interoperability communications for first responders?,114,,
427,0.97,4567.696,4574.136,This is first responders.,115,,
428,0.97,4574.136,4580.075,I don't have any knowledge of its ability or desire to monitor any private source.,115,,
429,0.97,4580.075,4590.452,It is basically to enable us in the event of a natural disaster to function as a coherent team throughout our region.,115,,
430,0.97,4590.452,4601.863,"Thank you . sorry, Madam chair.",116,,
431,0.97,4601.863,4602.864,I was just trying to clarify.,116,,
432,0.97,4602.864,4603.665,That is helpful.,117,,
433,0.97,4603.665,4613.108,"If I may, to that excellent question, the critical language that is triggering the question is this Open-Source background information.",118,,
434,0.97,4613.108,4618.046,I do not believe that information has anything to do with suspects or civilians.,118,,
435,0.97,4618.046,4627.422,"It is simply that information that through this system, first responders are able to share about themselves in order to coordinate the response.",118,,
436,0.97,4627.422,4638.967,I will also note that this was previously approved under the prior grant so this is an update.,118,,
437,0.97,4638.967,4641.87,It is to the system that has already been funded and approved and is operational.,118,,
438,0.97,4641.87,4642.671,Thank you.,119,,
439,0.97,4642.671,4696.158,"For this particular category, of items with national projects, violent extremism of which there are three expenditures in that category about 370 and can you just talk a little bit about how we enter that use of these systems and Technologies is only triggered in those instances of domestic violence extremism as opposed to other types of emergency management like crowd control?",119,,
440,0.97,4701.263,4732.427,"My impression is that--for swell, crowd control tends to be a section only level event and does not generally require operation of King County, et cetera so I think this differs and is more for those that are communicating needs and resources from one end of the region to the other.",120,,
441,0.97,4732.427,4735.33,If that helps to answer your question.,120,,
442,0.97,4738.8,4744.339,It does a little bit.,121,,
443,0.97,4744.339,4806.801,"In our recent history, crowd control situations--we sought the assistance of other jurisdictions and I just want to know that we aren't just saying that any particular large crowd control event is an example of domestic terrorism and I just want to understand a little bit again before the next meeting if you prefer, I want to understand about the protocols in place and how this is defined and restricted to domestic terrorism threat.",121,,
444,0.97,4806.801,4836.565,"In some kind of crowd control situation, that is at a lower level throughout special operations in coordinated with other agencies and for assistance and the only thing I can give you is that these are meant for natural disaster and in my opinion, something like crowd control, it will not rise to the level where this is needed.",122,,
445,0.97,4836.565,4843.505,Thank you.,123,,
446,0.97,4843.505,4849.044,Any other questions before he moved to the National priority projects and emerging threat section?,123,,
447,0.97,4849.044,4854.449,"Madam chair, I will try to formulate a question on the fly here.",124,,
448,0.97,4854.449,4887.549,"So, if a national--excuse me, if a domestic violence Extremist situation or the use of being deployed in the ruse, let's say, how do you protect against this type of technology being deployed if it is under the title of what we do but it is used for a ruse?",124,,
449,0.97,4887.549,4902.03,"So, this technology is about the cooperation of agencies . It is not meant to target private groups.",125,,
450,0.97,4902.03,4906.301,We are looking to have a operating picture.,125,,
451,0.97,4906.301,4936.364,"Specific to the crowd control, there is an activity that would have any policy or legislation that comes up I don't see this being used for any crowd control situation going forward.",125,,
452,0.97,4936.364,4943.638,"Councilmembers, I feel like I am having a hard time tracking the threat of this discussion.",126,,
453,0.97,4943.638,4945.807,Are we still talking about the tactical awareness kit?,126,,
454,0.97,4945.807,4948.51,With the application?,126,,
455,0.97,4948.51,4969.264,"We are talking about on the grid for one, two, three, three items that are all defined as technologies and tools to deal with domestic violence.",127,,
456,0.97,4969.264,4979.741,We have the awareness kit.,127,,
457,0.97,4993.755,4996.658,Show we move on?,127,,
458,0.97,4996.658,4999.861,"Yes, thank you.",128,,
459,0.97,4999.861,5005.734,The next questions are in the emerging threat question.,129,,
460,0.97,5005.734,5012.941,I will pause to see if I am jumping ahead to far.,129,,
461,0.97,5012.941,5013.975,I think we are good.,130,,
462,0.97,5013.975,5029.424,"Great, so, the first line on the emerging threats Digital Radiograph x-ray system for 150,000, my questions are does SPD currently have this and if so, how is it being used?",131,,
463,0.97,5029.424,5040.935,With something like this be used at a stop?,131,,
464,0.97,5040.935,5043.571,This technology would enhance what we already have.,132,,
465,0.97,5043.571,5065.126,This area of technology is rapidly moving in getting more clarity and so this is something that would give our technicians a much more or better idea of what is in that backpack or suitcase.,132,,
466,0.97,5065.126,5073.334,This is a specialized piece of gear.,132,,
467,0.97,5073.334,5087.949,"Just by that, I would not expect it to be available for any kind of contact in a Non- environment.",132,,
468,0.97,5087.949,5096.791,"If it is being deployed, does the person being scanned know they are being scanned or what is the policy?",133,,
469,0.97,5096.791,5101.529,On use and notification.,133,,
470,0.97,5101.529,5112.307,If you are talking about--I don't think this is really--I cannot think of an instance where a person themselves would be scanned.,134,,
471,0.97,5112.307,5125.053,There may be property associated and we would be following all the policies in regards to the contact or arrest or whatever the situation might be.,134,,
472,0.97,5125.053,5128.756,There is lots of scenarios that I can think of and I am sure you can as well.,134,,
473,0.97,5128.756,5131.659,This is for more high-level things.,134,,
474,0.97,5131.659,5151.346,There is a suspicious package or something like that where we can utilize this to see what it is and not really in an arrest situation but more just a potential high threat situation.,134,,
475,0.97,5151.346,5160.622,Is there a policy on using it on someone that has a backpack or something like that?,135,,
476,0.97,5160.622,5163.725,If the person is attached to the parcel?,135,,
477,0.97,5163.725,5166.127,Do you have a policy on how to proceed?,135,,
478,0.97,5166.127,5173.301,Thank you.,136,,
479,0.97,5173.301,5179.04,"Well, in any stop, any detention is governed by our policies.",136,,
480,0.97,5179.04,5195.557,We could probably give the policy number but it would have to be where officers would have to have a suspicion and probable cause for the backpack to be searched and a lot of it would depend on the subject themselves.,136,,
481,0.97,5195.557,5196.891,Their demeanor as well.,136,,
482,0.97,5196.891,5199.46,This is not meant for a dynamic situation.,136,,
483,0.97,5199.46,5216.277,"This is meant for the situation has been stabilized and we need to find out what the level of threat is from package A. plus, it will take at least up to an hour to deploy the scene.",136,,
484,0.97,5216.277,5230.091,"Just based on the fact that it is housed in one unit, I don't foresee a situation where it would be used with a person that is actively carrying some type of clothing or backpack.",136,,
485,0.97,5230.091,5243.004,Especially considering that it was the situation with an individual that is wearing a backpack and you are applying the procedures that would allow you to search that backpack.,137,,
486,0.97,5243.004,5251.613,You would do that physically as opposed to hauling out a piece of equipment to x-ray it.,137,,
487,0.97,5251.613,5267.128,"Yeah, this would basically happen after the person has been contacted and again, we would determine what type of threat is inside the item.",138,,
488,0.97,5267.128,5268.196,Thank you.,139,,
489,0.97,5268.196,5288.683,"Just very briefly, under a Terry stop, you do not have the authority under the law or the fourth minute to conduct a search using technology like this.",140,,
490,0.97,5288.683,5296.924,We separated that out in the policies and such that searches are very distinct from the policy on investigative detentions in order to not complete the issue.,140,,
491,0.97,5296.924,5311.739,Our search policy is very clear that you do this in favor of a search warrant unless there is a search incident to arrest which is a different circumstance where you have probable cause.,140,,
492,0.97,5311.739,5338.299,"There are times when there can be community care taking searches but that is the abandoned property and concern that it might be an explosive device where this technology might be employed, it is not designed to be used on a person but it is supposed to be used on containers, backpack, unidentified items.",140,,
493,0.97,5338.299,5343.071,Thank you.,141,,
494,0.97,5343.071,5348.209,We appreciate your questions and this is helpful for the viewing public who might also have questions.,141,,
495,0.97,5348.209,5349.477,Are there any others?,141,,
496,0.97,5349.477,5354.482,Just the last of the questions I have here.,142,,
497,0.97,5354.482,5375.069,"Our national priority projects and emerging threats, regional tactical robots for 120,000, could you give us an example of when SPD has used this or would like to use us and if it has been used in the past, what has the outcome been?",142,,
498,0.97,5375.069,5389.784,We started to mention some of the policies that I think already dictate the use of robots but if you could just remind me what those are as well.,142,,
499,0.97,5389.784,5392.487,"So, I will give an example of when this robot would be used.",143,,
500,0.97,5392.487,5417.879,"I think I mentioned it before but for a hostage and Barricaded situation where we have an idea that the subject is in a certain room or certain part of a building around a corner where there is not a lot of cover for a human officer that we would have to deploy resources, officers to look in, the robot could take their place.",143,,
501,0.97,5417.879,5444.105,"The robot would be able to give us active intelligence about the locations, the threat level inside or whatever building or area that we want and to provide feedback through Video to the operator which can inform the commander about the situation and also help dictate tactics and to bring things to a safe conclusion.",143,,
502,0.97,5444.105,5449.076,It takes the place of a human officer.,143,,
503,0.97,5449.076,5452.647,Think of a hostage Barricaded and you have gone through a progression of tactics.,143,,
504,0.97,5452.647,5479.207,"We tried negotiations but at some point, the decision is made where we either need to deny access to a certain area or we want to introduce either some chemical admissions to deny a certain area or we just maybe want to knock on the door and open the door to get a view inside a certain area.",143,,
505,0.97,5479.207,5485.346,"Right now, the only fallback is to use human officers for that that are armed and have to protect themselves.",143,,
506,0.97,5485.346,5495.99,This gives us that standoff distance with the ability use time and distance to accomplish what we set out to do.,143,,
507,0.97,5495.99,5502.129,We need intelligence on what is happening but it does not force us to send an officer to do the work.,143,,
508,0.97,5502.129,5514.242,"It lessens the potential for a confrontation between the officers and that subject, wherever they may be.",143,,
509,0.97,5514.242,5522.016,"Often times in my experience, opening that first door is a flashpoint and potential for conflicts.",143,,
510,0.97,5522.016,5526.554,"If you have an officer in that door, that is the potential that could be higher than a robot.",143,,
511,0.97,5526.554,5543.905,It addresses the gap and allows us to get insight intelligence into an area that we need without exposing officers and without exasperating that conflicts.,143,,
512,0.97,5543.905,5547.575,Thank you.,144,,
513,0.97,5547.575,5549.41,Any other questions?,144,,
514,0.97,5549.41,5553.347,Thank you so much.,145,,
515,0.97,5553.347,5590.217,"I just want to flag that my interest on this bill, as a preview, there are five items that are flagged as subject to the surveillance ordinance and I would like to know--they are fined as subject to the surveillance ordinance but I am feeling that some of the five might be replacements of similar Technologies that the city might already have.",146,,
516,0.97,5590.217,5620.247,"If this is a replacement for a technology that the city already has that is already on the Grandfathered list of SPD technology projects that have been Grandfathered in and we are doing the approvals after the fact, I want to know which of those five items fit that bill because what we have said about those items is we aren't going to hold up the purchase of the items until after the review.",146,,
517,0.97,5620.247,5628.189,We will do them after the fact and that is a finite number of items like that.,146,,
518,0.97,5628.189,5647.108,"I want to know if any of these five are like that and for the others, if we would be interested to come from the expectation as you stated, Brian, that the purchase will not happen until after the surveillance review.",146,,
519,0.97,5647.108,5654.682,"We can get you that information, obviously, and we will do so.",147,,
520,0.97,5654.682,5659.553,The one thing I would like is the upgrades to current systems also trigger a review under the surveillance ordinance.,147,,
521,0.97,5659.553,5673.901,"Even if they are Pre-Existing as they have different capabilities, that might bring them back to the forefront of the review.",147,,
522,0.97,5673.901,5677.405,They are not considered among the items that we are doing reviews after the fact.,148,,
523,0.97,5677.405,5684.745,I will need to go through and I will let you know the status of each.,149,,
524,0.97,5684.745,5700.694,My interest is not in Burdening you in the Department beyond our expectations under the surveillance ordinance.,150,,
525,0.97,5700.694,5713.941,"If these are replacements of existing Technologies that we have already identified as Grandfathered in and that we do the reviews after the purchase, that is an allowance that I am interested in taking.",150,,
526,0.97,5713.941,5719.013,Do you have a question?,151,,
527,0.97,5719.013,5719.447,I do.,152,,
528,0.97,5719.447,5746.107,"I think this last one might have come up last year in our discussion and the passage of the final Grandfathered technologies and specifically, I am wondering if this item falls into Situational awareness cameras with capabilities which is something that was included in the last batch of Technologies.",152,,
529,0.97,5746.107,5756.016,That is an excellent question and I will have to validate that and get back to you.,153,,
530,0.97,5756.016,5756.817,"Fantastic, thank you.",154,,
531,0.97,5756.817,5761.322,I appreciate the time that you have spent on this item.,154,,
532,0.97,5761.322,5772.533,"Councilmembers, if you have additional questions, or amendments for Greg, I ask that you get that information to him.",154,,
533,0.97,5772.533,5778.906,Councilmember Nelson and then chief Todd Kibbee.,154,,
534,0.97,5778.906,5783.711,Thank you very much.,155,,
535,0.97,5783.711,5793.387,This is about the technology itself but the central staff memo indicates that one possible concern is that it creates ongoing funding issues.,155,,
536,0.97,5793.387,5806.333,"So, I am wondering if that is a concern that is newly raised because of what we are hearing from executives about the budget situation this year.",155,,
537,0.97,5806.333,5826.453,Because it seems as though it is an ongoing program and do we already consider what other training is necessary for the receiving of these grants with part of regular operations?,155,,
538,0.97,5826.453,5835.229,I guess the better way of asking it is I just wanted to know a little bit more about that concerned with ongoing expenses.,155,,
539,0.97,5835.229,5838.465,Thanks.,155,,
540,0.97,5838.465,5877.338,"Councilmember, I am trying to remember what I might have said at the central staff report but I think that typically the equipment that is purchased like the bottom robot that adds additional capability to Stds and operations, there is not necessarily a replacement plan for that robot, per se.",156,,
541,0.97,5877.338,5881.108,There is no funds being built into the budget to replace that robot.,156,,
542,0.97,5881.108,5896.724,"So, if the grant is discontinued for some reason in the future and there is a need to replace that robot, the city general fund will not have any capability to pick up a new robot.",156,,
543,0.97,5896.724,5920.281,"To the extent that the program itself has maintenance or ongoing funding for equipment Sustainment, that is helpful but for the larger equipment purchases, the city itself is not in any way planning any kind of sinking fund to replace those in the future.",156,,
544,0.97,5923.484,5925.786,Thank you.,157,,
545,0.97,5925.786,5928.989,Is there another question?,157,,
546,0.97,5928.989,5932.893,"No, great.",157,,
547,0.97,5932.893,5935.396,Chief?,157,,

549,0.97,5936.43,5940.734,I was able to gather the information about the projects.,158,,
550,0.97,5940.734,5948.742,Number one is Cybersecurity and starved target crowded and intelligence sharing.,158,,
551,0.97,5948.742,5956.083,The third and fourth is domestic violence extremism and the fit is emerging threats.,158,,
552,0.97,5956.083,5966.126,Those are the projects that are developed and sent down through FEMA to us to address.,158,,
553,0.97,5966.126,5966.527,Fantastic.,159,,
554,0.97,5966.527,5981.308,That of course--each of those projects are named as Subtitles under the categories on the grid.,159,,
555,0.97,5981.308,5990.317,Thank you for helping us track that back.,159,,
556,0.97,5990.317,5991.585,I was not following that either.,159,,
557,0.97,5991.585,5991.985,Appreciate that.,159,,
