53,0.97,168.334,177.043,"Colleagues, appreciate the second and the support here today to potentially hold grocery worker hazard pay.",25,,
54,0.97,177.043,184.651,This would have eliminated the hazard pay requirement as part of the legislation while keeping other items intact.,25,,
55,0.97,184.651,191.257,"Colleagues, I have made a motion to hold this item until September 13th as it is important for us to continually read.",25,,
56,0.97,191.257,198.665,This is a conversation about West best public health practices are.,25,,
57,0.97,198.665,206.172,"Our commitment was to make sure that this hazard pay ordinance was not in Perpetuity, but that we Revisited it within a four month period.",25,,
58,0.97,206.172,213.68,We had intended to address this by bringing it back to Council to eliminate this component.,25,,
59,0.97,213.68,226.926,"Given the city's effort to try to reopen our city, and the President projections at the time we were seeing in June about increased vaccination rates and a decrease in transmission.",25,,
60,0.97,226.926,244.844,"Unfortunately, based on the city's best public health practices, are County public health practices, and national information from the centers for disease control, which have been shared in the last week, including as early as today at our own city and state levels.",25,,
61,0.97,244.844,251.851,We know that fully Vaccinated individuals can very much transmit Covid-19 if they are not properly wearing a mask.,25,,
62,0.97,251.851,260.927,"If individuals, even are Vaccinated, are not properly wearing a mask and don't have access to the vaccine, they are highly contagious.",25,,
63,0.97,260.927,268.134,The Delta variant now makes up over 90% of cases of new Covid cases in our country.,25,,
64,0.97,268.134,287.253,"We have this public health guidance to look at as we continue to try to protect the health and safety of front-line workers, especially Gawker workers who have been on the Frontlines making sure our community has access to food and critical services to make sure that families are healthy and safe.",25,,
65,0.97,287.253,304.47,"Following this best practice, and the recommendations from public health, I am requesting today that we hold this item until the 13th where we will continue to evaluate our public health guidance to make sure it is reasonably safe to engage in any future conversations.",25,,
66,0.97,304.47,307.507,That would involve this piece of legislation.,25,,
67,0.97,307.507,315.915,"We will continue to look at the latest guidance from the CDC as we approach the 13th, but appreciate your consideration of holding this item for September 13th.",25,,

71,0.97,326.793,330.797,"Thank you, president pro Tem Pedersen.",27,,
72,0.97,330.797,335.134,I will be voting yes on the motion to postpone the vote.,27,,
73,0.97,335.134,365.331,"But, I wanted to clarify as I did last time, the Council dealt with this a few weeks ago, to the members of the public, that I will not be supporting . It required big grocery store to pay workers an additional four dollars per hour and hazard pay for the dangers of doing essential work during the pandemic and in contact with so many people.",27,,
74,0.97,365.331,373.84,"The ordinance lasted two years after the public health emergency, in Perpetuity, but for three years.",27,,
75,0.97,373.84,384.083,I believe and I know that working people feel this way that frankly the lease that should be done is to support the essential workers is to keep it for that time duration.,27,,
76,0.97,384.083,396.763,I don't find it acceptable that the Council will be talking about this before the public health emergency is even over.,27,,
77,0.97,396.763,405.371,"We know that there are many uncertainties in the next coming months related to the Covid variance, especially the Delta variant.",27,,
78,0.97,405.371,426.392,"When this ordinance--if this ordinance comes up for a vote in September to strip the grocery workers of their hazard pay, I just wanted to let the members of the public you are watching know that I will be voting no on that, but today this is a motion to delay the boat for a future meeting, and I will be voting yes on that.",27,,
79,0.97,426.392,426.826,Thank you.,27,,
80,0.97,426.826,428.427,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",28,,

83,0.97,431.764,432.799,President.,29,,
84,0.97,432.799,437.503,"Colleagues, that's not an accurate statement.",29,,
85,0.97,437.503,440.807,Councilmember Sawant it is not accurate to say that this legislation extended for 3 years.,29,,
86,0.97,440.807,445.912,There is various pieces of hazard pay legislation that this Council has enacted during Covid.,29,,
87,0.97,445.912,452.518,"The one that we are talking about specific to hazard pay, four dollars for to grocery store workers was intended for the.",29,,
88,0.97,452.518,455.454,Of the emergency that we are currently in.,29,,
89,0.97,455.454,457.723,We committed to Revisit it in four months.,29,,
90,0.97,457.723,460.827,There is not a walking back of a policy.,29,,
91,0.97,460.827,464.53,There was never a three month period included.,29,,
92,0.97,464.53,470.536,There is various components that we have layered as a Council to protect the self and safety of the individuals truly on the front lines.,29,,
93,0.97,470.536,474.34,All of those commitments remain intact.,29,,
94,0.97,474.34,484.951,"This legislation is specific to hazard pay for grocery workers, and following the public health guidance is exactly why we have continued to extend it.",29,,
95,0.97,484.951,495.595,"Just want to make sure that folks are clear about the Timeline that was included, specifically in this legislation versus the other critically important legislation that I also fully supported.",29,,
96,0.97,495.595,499.098,I see Councilmember Herbold as well on the screen.,29,,
97,0.97,499.098,503.569,I know that she and others have been working very hard on that type of support for other Front- line workers.,29,,
98,0.97,503.569,508.608,This was a narrow piece specific to those grocery workers.,29,,
99,0.97,508.608,511.511,We are going to continue to look at the best public health practices.,29,,
100,0.97,511.511,513.045,I don't want there to be any confusion.,29,,
101,0.97,513.045,537.236,"As someone who comes from labor, who has worked with 21 members who have specifically worked with the groceries as well to make sure that we can address transmission, it was important for me not only to pass the legislation, to be the first in Washington State to put forward the hazard pay legislation and to then be a model for other cities and regions around Washington State to follow.",29,,
102,0.97,537.236,548.681,"I want it to be very clear I continue to stand in solidarity with grocery workers, and will continue to work with those who are helping to provide food and essential services in our community.",29,,
103,0.97,548.681,554.12,There is no question about my loyalty to making sure that the working families have the protections they need.,29,,
104,0.97,554.12,559.825,"It is important to clarify that this legislation is different from the other pieces, and the Timeline is not a three year look back.",29,,
105,0.97,559.825,562.828,We will continue to look at the public health effects practices.,29,,
106,0.97,562.828,566.566,"Councilmembers, I'd like to go ahead and vote on this.",30,,
107,0.97,566.566,568.034,The motion is to hold it.,30,,
108,0.97,568.034,572.038,I think there's going to be agreement to hold it.,30,,

169,0.97,884.416,902.501,"Today, thanks to the reporting at the South Seattle Emerald, we get a closer look at the inner workings of the system and learn just how Self-Serving, self reinforcing bureaucratic and paternalistic this 9+ million dollars system is protecting both itself and the SPD from the community.",55,,

651,0.97,4040.503,4042.405,It was a question that came up in committee.,157,,
652,0.97,4042.405,4052.248,The administrative costs are estimated to average out as about 6.5% out of the $30 million.,157,,
653,0.97,4052.248,4057.42,The intent is really just to Memorialize that expectation.,157,,
654,0.97,4057.42,4062.825,"So, no one is taken by surprise when the costs are taken from the $30 million.",157,,
655,0.97,4062.825,4068.03,"Again, central staff confirmed with the city budget office and executive that that was indeed the intent.",157,,
656,0.97,4068.03,4090.286,"I also just want to flag that that--those administrative costs might differ depending on whether or not it is Hsd quickly funding an existing investment, or having to create a new program, which new programs will have to take more time.",157,,
657,0.97,4090.286,4101.664,"Those are not likely to be investments that can be made immediately, and they also will have slightly higher administrative costs, but it could still hopefully even out.",157,,

680,0.97,4258.921,4268.364,"We also knew when we passed the Jumpstart Seattle progressive revenue tax, that the 2021 proceeds from that tax would not begin coming into the city coffers until 2022.",166,,

1078,0.97,6953.446,6963.856,It explains a lot about,246,,
1079,0.97,6971.831,6985.211,And how important it is to use public policy tools to change the Exclusionary policies that may have had name changes over the years but are just as harmful.,247,,
1080,0.97,6985.211,7027.587,"The council passed legislation making sure that we were expressly directing the executive Department to every time we had the opportunity to use public dollars, to make sure they were going into community focused acquisition and development for communities that were formally red lined, communities still dealing with the legacy of the Redlining and folks who have been shut out of previous homeownership opportunities and thus had limited ability to acquire generational wealth because of those racist policies of the past.",247,,
1081,0.97,7027.587,7053.179,"Some of the ways we are hoping to continue to couple efforts like today's resolution with public policy and funding policy, to make sure the funds are going to those who have been disproportionately affected by discriminatory lending practices of the past . One example is in the 2000--2018 housing administration Finance plan on page 59.",247,,
1082,0.97,7053.179,7063.122,"It says the objectives of the Department, the Department of office of housing, should be to Prioritize partnerships and Prioritize development proposal submitted by organizations led by and accountable to communities most impacted by displacement, whatever available sites are located in the neighborhoods with high risk of displacement.",247,,

1084,0.97,7086.746,7114.507,Section 8 said the city will Prioritize opportunities with local communities and organizations that are culturally relevant and founded by communities that have been Disproportionally impacted by Covid and have organizational leadership and staff that reflect the communities they serve for the purposes of allocations of grants.,247,,
1085,0.97,7117.443,7118.544,We put about $50 million in the Seattle rescue plan.,247,,
1086,0.97,7118.544,7122.482,We are trying to tell the departments in the executive to target those investments so we can have more black led communities really have the opportunity to access those funds first.,247,,
1087,0.97,7122.482,7127.587,I greatly appreciate the organizing that is happened with new hope and the community at large.,247,,
1088,0.97,7127.587,7145.204,We have heard from a number of folks over the last few meetings about how this project is ready to go and I look forward as the budget process Tarts to make sure that we funding these efforts in the fall process.,247,,
1089,0.97,7145.204,7173.166,We know the project is somewhere between Predevelopment and shovel ready and they are likely to apply for fall funds and additional funds available to Jumpstart we will be able to really your ties the community driven projects like this . to make sure we are supporting and expanding our commitment office of housing investments to make sure these projects get the funding they need.,247,,
1090,0.97,7173.166,7176.235,We need to make sure we are reducing and removing partnership requirement barriers.,247,,
1091,0.97,7176.235,7192.952,I have heard this directly from communities that have met with me from black clergy who also echo many of the things I heard from communities like groups have been trying to create more affordable housing.,247,,
1092,0.97,7192.952,7202.428,And they have been faced with this requirement for a partnership that really removes the ability for them to have ownership and control and direction over the land of the housing they are trying to create.,247,,
1093,0.97,7202.428,7233.893,"In addition to supporting efforts like this in the funding that is required, we would be working through this year's budget to remove those Covenant requirements . removed the partnership requirements that have been a major barrier to communities of color that have been trying to create Self- directed housing . I am looking forward to continuing conversations about expanding opportunities for Progressive revenue.",247,,
1094,0.97,7233.893,7246.272,I am long in support of making sure we have all progressive revenue options we can advance that has been plagued by a Regressive tax system.,247,,
1095,0.97,7246.272,7279.438,"I see this effort as a broad statement to say we will continue to advance progressive revenue strategies so we can layer current progressive sources to make sure we actually create the scale of funding needed to invest in affordable housing and so many other crises affecting our communities, especially are black community that has been disproportionately affected by Redlining . Thank you for bringing this forward and for your work to include some language regarding this.",247,,

1099,0.97,7296.489,7321.814,Thank you . I wanted to reiterate the gratitude to everyone who have been part of this and will continue to be part of the people's budget campaign in the autumn.,249,,
1100,0.97,7321.814,7341.834,"A lot of black community members to were around in the 60s including Reverend Jeffrey and many others have told us that at that time when they were sold this program as urban renewal, they recognized it was black removal.",249,,
1101,0.97,7341.834,7350.109,James Baldwin Famously dubbed this urban renewal program as black removal in the 1960s.,249,,
1102,0.97,7350.109,7362.722,"I just want to point out this is not an Artifact of history as Arendt is as it was, it is happening again today . not in the same legalized racism kind of way.",249,,
1103,0.97,7362.722,7384.343,"But because of skyrocketing rent, we know that the rent is Decimating the lives of working people as a whole in every metropolitan area in the United States and this is being felt by black committee members and some of the other communities of color.",249,,
1104,0.97,7384.343,7389.415,We know that in Seattle rent has gone up 21% since January.,249,,
1105,0.97,7389.415,7392.752,Which is an annualized rent increase.,249,,
1106,0.97,7392.752,7407.299,It is Eye-Popping a rate of 42% and that is double the national average.,249,,
1107,0.97,7407.299,7423.315,"That is how scary life will be for people in Seattle once the Eviction moratorium is lifted and that is absolutely why I would urge all members of the public listening right now to join us and if you joined us already, keep fighting with us to do rent control in Seattle.",249,,
1108,0.97,7423.315,7429.822,It would affect as soon as the state lifted its absolutely unjust ban on rent control.,249,,
1109,0.97,7429.822,7443.669,We know we need to promote that battle at the state Legislature and it will not happen if we allow Democratic politicians in the city and Democratic politicians in the state to teach each other cover.,249,,

1114,0.97,7469.528,7479.572,This would positively affect black community members a Six- month notice for a rent increase.,249,,
