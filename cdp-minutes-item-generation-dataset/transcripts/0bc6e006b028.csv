6,0.97,308.141,326.192,Why put into law rules that they can ignore because there are no consequences?,2,,

8,0.97,330.129,335.301,I've not seen a model that's better than ours.,2,,
9,0.97,335.301,369.168,"This is a claim from the most important person in our supposed accountability system, the very same person that chose to ignore the murder of Terry Haber last year and failed to do any investigation.",2,,
10,0.97,369.168,374.006,They deem these killings lawful and proper or failed to release findings.,2,,
11,0.97,374.006,391.29,This is the same person that's worked his whole life defending police including defending New York City from the claims of the central park five.,2,,
12,0.97,391.29,404.637,This is ranked 20% out of a 100 score and the SPD has killed more people after the start of our efforts to increase accountability than the decade before that.,2,,
13,0.97,404.637,419.786,We must create a system of accountability led by the community and not police.,2,,

19,0.97,482.548,494.06,"There are many examples of events that happened over the last 13 months that you could not follow up for accountability against the SPD, for example the pink umbrella incident.",4,,
20,0.97,494.06,524.724,"That was declared a riot by SPD and therefore if this bill isn't amended, basically the use of tear gas against civilians would be justified, including also people who experience it just sitting in their homes, just bystanders and collateral damage.",4,,
21,0.97,524.724,532.498,That would all be justified.,4,,

32,0.97,623.856,652.585,"We would ask the Council to signal their support by taking the modest step of making the enforcement of low level substances the lowest priority possible, signaling that people are ready for comprehensive changes in drug laws.",6,,

47,0.97,772.505,786.719,"For SPD, right now the limitation to the gathering, that you have to be in a gathering that's not a part of a public disturbance, and it's really restricting in determining who's eligible.",10,,
48,0.97,786.719,816.081,I can't think of who would be able to use this right of action.,10,,
49,0.97,816.081,829.995,The child who was pepper sprayed by SPD was supported and said that could make it violent.,10,,
50,0.97,829.995,835.467,Unfortunately this is not very just and needs to be amended.,10,,
51,0.97,835.467,842.808,I would like to ask Council to remove the restrictions on who can seek damages.,10,,

56,0.97,876.976,886.485,Thises the mechanism for when SPD violates the bill.,13,,
57,0.97,886.485,898.564,Spd themselves can determine if a situation meets this definition and will interpret it in the narrowest way or outright lie about the situation.,13,,
58,0.97,898.564,906.138,"They have deployed weapons against hundreds of people in the last 13 months, causing serious injuries.",13,,
59,0.97,906.138,913.479,Is there an example that would qualify under the current right of action?,13,,
60,0.97,913.479,929.194,Everyone SPD hit with tear and pepper gas during the pink umbrella incident would be barred because it was declared a riot.,13,,
61,0.97,929.194,939.605,The woman who went into cardiac arrest would be barred because SPD deemed the crowd to be violent.,13,,
62,0.97,939.605,949.048,The journalist who lost her hearing would be barred because she was separated from protesters.,13,,
63,0.97,949.048,960.626,The child pepper sprayed by SPD would be barred based on the assertion that protesters were pushing SPD and therefore the gathering was violent.,13,,
64,0.97,960.626,971.737,We can't leave these determinations to the subjective opinion of SPD or its Sympathizers.,13,,
65,0.97,971.737,984.249,I ask Council members to amend this action.,13,,

70,0.97,1021.587,1035.401,Two weeks ago I sat in the same place listening to Quote- Unquote experts talking about how Seattle lacks resources to address mental health issues in the community.,16,,
71,0.97,1035.401,1046.812,Not a single person is offering Community-Based solutions.,16,,
72,0.97,1046.812,1048.814,Calling 911 guarantees police intervention.,16,,
73,0.97,1048.814,1060.893,In what world do you think that someone experiencing a mental health crisis wants an armed force to provide aid?,16,,
74,0.97,1060.893,1077.843,"This is not a solution, when more than half your constituents are terrified of the police and rightly so.",16,,
75,0.97,1077.843,1098.33,"After a Long-Standing history of mental health problems, we have had lives taken by SPD because the officers are untrained and Unexperienced, and shouldn't be dealing with mental health concerns.",16,,
76,0.97,1098.33,1109.675,"Another thing people are needing, I encourage you to think about the racism and the accessibility problems of posting a meeting at 9:30 A.M.",16,,
77,0.97,1109.675,1112.945,On a weekday.,16,,
78,0.97,1112.945,1115.881,These meetings are inherently racist and inaccessible.,16,,
79,0.97,1115.881,1126.425,You want people to be away from work for an extended period of time during the workday.,16,,

95,0.97,1276.408,1292.958,Spd deployed weapons against hundreds in the last 13 months causing serious injuries.,21,,
96,0.97,1292.958,1318.15,What does less than lethal mean?,21,,
97,0.97,1318.15,1321.687,Some have lost hearing from SPD.,21,,
98,0.97,1321.687,1334.9,"These things are going to continue to get worse and worse unless Council does something about it and stands up, and changes the language even from less than lethal.",21,,
99,0.97,1334.9,1340.972,Just because they're not bullets doesn't mean they can't kill somebody.,21,,

102,0.97,1350.415,1367.699,"It was like watching the 60s, but the modern day version, where people were protesting and just being bombarded with tear gas and pepper spray, because a judge granted them to go do that.",21,,

154,0.97,2017.849,2040.204,"So in terms of serving the public, I learned the number one way I'll do that is by Partnering with the community and trying to understand how people walk through our services and where people get stuck or where they are Underserved in the process.",31,,
155,0.97,2040.204,2067.131,"With the Department of licensing, I did that with a team.",31,,
156,0.97,2067.131,2086.284,One of my favorite examples is getting the third gender option of gender in licenses.,31,,
157,0.97,2086.284,2095.66,We had created this because we'd made it incredibly hard for people to change their gender on license or Id cards.,31,,
158,0.97,2095.66,2116.247,Now I'm understanding people's experience with the systems and we developed as Barrier-Free of a process as we could to allow them to change their gender and not charging a fee.,31,,

168,0.97,2204.835,2247.478,I want a sense of sort of what kind of experience you have with unionized work forces and what your vision is for sort of the model of how we--how the court provides those services related to probation in a way that's focused on harm reduction as opposed to Transactional supervision.,33,,
169,0.97,2249.58,2257.054,The Department of licensing has members in four different unions.,34,,

172,0.97,2264.929,2293.124,"As the Department of licensing, I joined the agency after a heartbreaking scandal three and a half years ago, where the front page of the Seattle times exposed that the agency had been sharing information with ice.",34,,
173,0.97,2293.124,2303.167,"Prior to my role, they saw themselves as being a gate keeper for saying no to people.",34,,
174,0.97,2303.167,2319.35,We worked really hard as a regulatory agency to partner with licensees.,34,,
175,0.97,2319.35,2328.392,We believe people will comply if you give them the tools they need to be successful.,34,,
176,0.97,2328.392,2333.097,So we went to a culture of partnership.,34,,
177,0.97,2333.097,2356.954,I would expect that should happen with probation services and help people get to a better place.,34,,
178,0.97,2356.954,2363.627,"The mindset should be, I'm here to support you and energy you to succeed.",34,,
179,0.97,2363.627,2367.832,There will be a lot of work.,34,,
180,0.97,2367.832,2369.433,Er directions there's a lot of work.,34,,

182,0.97,2380.444,2392.59,I think having clear conversations with partners and laborers will be fundamental in making that transformation happen.,34,,

184,0.97,2394.325,2397.428,I don't have any other questions.,35,,

187,0.97,2424.021,2451.816,I think the report has an accompanying city auditor report as well and really focused on transforming services and working in tandem with the municipal court.,36,,

193,0.97,2516.08,2521.185,I like to think about the vision we have for the destination.,37,,
194,0.97,2521.185,2522.419,Our destination is Hawaii.,37,,
195,0.97,2522.419,2527.858,I imagine we're flying a plane there.,37,,
196,0.97,2527.858,2533.597,"We Node too know, are we on track to reach our destination?",37,,
197,0.97,2627.124,2641.005,"It was a grassroots movement of users of the court, advocacy for the budget of the justice that first pointed us in this direction.",38,,
198,0.97,2641.005,2666.764,"Creating systems that allow for that continuous improvement by hearing from folks who are using your services is, I think, really important for realizing that vision.",38,,

203,0.97,2769.266,2783.313,We talk about just transition and the context of a climate change and moving from a pretty good economy to a great economy.,39,,
204,0.97,2783.313,2802.533,I don't know how can transition for folks within the court who rely on these jobs to support themselves and their families.,39,,
205,0.97,2802.533,2807.871,I know they are nervous about being left out and being left without a career.,39,,
206,0.97,2807.871,2832.462,I'm interested in continuing to have conversations with you all about how we can come up with a plan to transition for the work force as we continue to implement your recommendations and as we continue to serve how to transform the municipal court system as a whole.,39,,

240,0.97,3246.076,3254.951,So we're going to toss it over to Andrea.,59,,
241,0.97,3254.951,3255.952,Good morning.,60,,
242,0.97,3255.952,3258.722,I'm the contract budget manager for our division.,60,,
243,0.97,3258.722,3267.831,This morning I'll be providing the overview of the programs within Hsd.,60,,
244,0.97,3267.831,3276.439,"Starting off with health one, the 2021 budget added funds to expand the units from one to three units.",60,,
245,0.97,3276.439,3285.148,"Our second unit launched this year during the spring, and we anticipate the third to launch in the fall.",60,,
246,0.97,3285.148,3304.501,Health one is a partnership between the Seattle fire Department and human services Department aging and disability services case managers.,60,,
247,0.97,3304.501,3310.106,The team brings unique skills and approaches to all the scenes they respond to.,60,,
248,0.97,3310.106,3327.057,"The units are designed to respond to individuals immediately in their moment of need and help them navigate through that difficult situation, whether it be medical care, mental health care, shelter or other social services.",60,,
249,0.97,3327.057,3348.812,The Overarching goal is to reduce the impact of Nonemergent calls on the division and to help those calls.,60,,
250,0.97,3348.812,3355.552,This is an example of a case study and impact of health one's work.,60,,
251,0.97,3355.552,3396.159,"It's really important to highlight that this is one example and that overall our data shows in the last eight months, health one units have responded to nearly 540 alarms and enrolled almost 800 clients in referral help.",60,,
252,0.97,3396.159,3402.265,We are excited about this partnership and excited to expand to other units.,60,,
253,0.97,3402.265,3450.113,I want to be sure that folks don't have questions.,61,,
254,0.97,3450.113,3451.714,Let's just check in.,61,,
255,0.97,3451.714,3472.936,"Based on the health two expansion that occurred in April, and since we have you from Hsd here, are you anticipating sufficient staffing for the health three expansion coming in the fall?",61,,
256,0.97,3472.936,3475.839,"Yes, I can answer this.",62,,
257,0.97,3475.839,3483.179,"Yes, we are conducting the hiring process currently for the expanded positions.",62,,
258,0.97,3483.179,3491.254,"So we anticipate within the next month having that all finalized then starting the training for the new staff, so they will be ready by the fall.",62,,
259,0.97,3491.254,3493.69,Thank you so much.,63,,
260,0.97,3493.69,3520.583,Any other questions from Councilmembers before we move on?,63,,
261,0.97,3520.583,3520.884,All right.,63,,
262,0.97,3520.884,3521.251,No questions.,63,,
263,0.97,3521.251,3521.551,Thank you.,63,,
264,0.97,3521.551,3533.897,I'll move on to the mobile crisis team and response team.,64,,
265,0.97,3533.897,3547.41,"The meeting at June 8th, the Seattle police Department and our partners from Desc were here and presented on the program aspect of their work.",64,,
266,0.97,3547.41,3551.447,Today I'll present on the Hsd funded portion.,64,,
267,0.97,3551.447,3584.447,"The crisis response team is a model that partners mental health professionals, Mhps with specially trained police officers for those experiencing behavioral health issues or crises.",64,,
268,0.97,3584.447,3610.873,"In the 2021 budget, the city moved the budget of Hsd.",64,,
269,0.97,3610.873,3618.481,They focus on the top ten list of individuals and locations within a precinct.,64,,
270,0.97,3618.481,3628.992,So each precinct generates a list of top ten calls or locations that may be related to specifically behavioral health.,64,,
271,0.97,3628.992,3647.377,Mental health individuals are creating a tailored plan that police can use if a mental health official cannot be on the scene.,64,,
272,0.97,3647.377,3659.222,This includes coordination with external providers and allows police officers to have a detailed plan on how to respond to somebody in a mental health crisis.,64,,
273,0.97,3659.222,3673.436,The team also provides phone and virtual follow-ups to Individualed and could be dispatched to situations specific of high Utilizers of the 911 system.,64,,
274,0.97,3673.436,3688.951,"If it's and individual that law enforcement and the crisis response team is familiar with, they may just dispatch a team of mental health professionals to respond to those types of calls.",64,,
275,0.97,3688.951,3708.805,And can you speak to whether or not you perceive any problematic changes or shifts resulting from the contract moving from SPD to Hsd?,65,,
276,0.97,3708.805,3710.706,That's a very good question.,66,,
277,0.97,3710.706,3714.577,At this time we have not discussed any shifts.,66,,
278,0.97,3714.577,3723.953,"But I think that we have the work going on, as you know, with the city's Sprint initiative.",66,,
279,0.97,3723.953,3736.032,There is discussion in the city planning on how to best use the crisis response programs that we currently have.,66,,
280,0.97,3736.032,3754.884,"My understanding from talking to SPD is the officers at the crisis response team, and many of them have been moved into patrol or left the Department.",67,,
281,0.97,3754.884,3756.686,I think there was five of them.,67,,
282,0.97,3756.686,3765.728,I think there's only one or two left in the Crt right now.,67,,
283,0.97,3765.728,3780.076,So that reduces the potential for Pairing the Desc experts with an officer.,67,,
284,0.97,3780.076,3823.052,"If in fact the SPD Pairing part of this program is becoming less used because of staffing issues at SPD, whether or not that creates an opportunity for Hsd to look at other ways to expand this important function.",67,,
285,0.97,3823.052,3830.693,I just see Hsd not just in a funding role but in a program development role.,67,,
286,0.97,3830.693,3848.611,"If the program is not functioning in the way it was designed because of staffing issues at SPD, I think that creates opportunities and challenges.",67,,
287,0.97,3849.979,3851.814,Not seeing any other questions.,67,,
288,0.97,3851.814,3853.583,We can move on?,67,,
289,0.97,3853.583,3856.252,Thank you.,68,,
290,0.97,3856.252,3867.73,"I'll provide an update on the mobile crisis team work, including a $1 million expansion of the mobile crisis team.",68,,
291,0.97,3867.73,3901.864,"Hsd is Partnering with King County Department of human services to provide the funding to their contract, which is with Desc, downtown emergency services center, which already supports County wide services for the mobile crisis team.",68,,
292,0.97,3901.864,3933.896,"As a side note, the our crisis response system really started to develop on the King County side in early 2008 to 2011-12 as part of the mental health and drug dependency sales tax the county collects for mental health substance abuse and court services.",68,,
293,0.97,3933.896,3944.907,"The crisis solutions center provides resources for police, fire, medics, mental health professionals and other first Responderses to respond to individuals in crisis.",68,,
294,0.97,3944.907,3955.885,It is designed to be an alternative to jail or hospitalization.,68,,
295,0.97,3955.885,3970.232,"There is the crisis diversion facility, which is a facility that ACCEPTS individuals who are in crisis that are referred by first responders in King County.",68,,
296,0.97,3970.232,3976.172,"The clients receive various types of stabilization, monitoring and referrals to other resources.",68,,
297,0.97,3976.172,3994.423,"The crisis solution center also includes what's called the crisis diversion interim services, designed to be a Step- down program which admits clients directly referred from the crisis diversion facility.",68,,
298,0.97,3994.423,4019.248,"After they are stabilized from a crisis standpoint, if that individual have a safe place to return to, maybe homeless or not have a living situation that would further advance their recovery, they can go to the interim services and may stay up to 14 days.",68,,
299,0.97,4019.248,4039.301,They are connected with an ongoing mental health or substance abuse therapy to help their overall health and develop the skills to prevent crises in the future.,68,,
300,0.97,4039.301,4052.748,"Also both of our diversion crisis facility and services are located within the city of Seattle, which is a great resource for Seattle, because it's close.",68,,
301,0.97,4052.748,4056.385,But the program is county-wide.,68,,
302,0.97,4056.385,4069.165,"As I mentioned, the primary fund source for the crisis solutions center is the mental illness and dependency sales tax Fund.",68,,
303,0.97,4069.165,4077.273,The third component is a mobile crisis team.,68,,
304,0.97,4077.273,4092.955,"This team is comprised of professionals who accept referrals from medical, police, fire, Emt, medics, to provide services to those experiencing a crisis.",68,,
305,0.97,4092.955,4097.726,This is a 43-Member team.,68,,
306,0.97,4097.726,4109.438,Each team has two mental health professionals who also have training in Deescalation and crisis response and substance abuse disorders.,68,,
307,0.97,4109.438,4142.304,"The team ACCEPTS referrals from first responders and from crisis connections, which operates what we know as 211, not only for Seattle and King County but statewide.",68,,
308,0.97,4142.304,4147.476,Then our last is the designated crisis responders.,68,,
309,0.97,4147.476,4162.124,"They were previously known as the county designated mental health professionals, so that may be more familiar with the committee.",68,,
310,0.97,4162.124,4184.647,"They have the authority to detain somebody involuntarily for a mental health issue if they are at danger to themselves or others or property, and they can detain somebody if they are disabled and a harm to themselves.",68,,
311,0.97,4184.647,4192.021,The goal is to stabilize the individual in the crisis in the community.,68,,
312,0.97,4192.021,4198.661,"The team has the ability to intervene within their own community, meeting the person where they're at.",68,,
313,0.97,4198.661,4211.74,They identify of resources on the scene and help provide that connection.,68,,
314,0.97,4211.74,4214.343,They could even transport somebody if needed.,68,,
315,0.97,4214.343,4240.97,"Their goal is to prevent and stabilize, and provide resources so there's no further need from intervention.",68,,
316,0.97,4240.97,4250.679,"The program overall is funded by--during 2020, the sales tax collection overall was down and that resulted in a shortage for the program overall.",68,,
317,0.97,4250.679,4258.821,It was amazing that the city stepped in and was able to fill that gap.,68,,
318,0.97,4258.821,4276.405,"In addition to filling that gap, there was a little excess revenue and we worked with Deoc and the county to propose a pilot for the behavioral health response team.",68,,
319,0.97,4276.405,4286.515,This team will work in collaboration with the existing mobile response team and crisis response team.,68,,
320,0.97,4286.515,4304.466,"In addition to including a mental health professional, this also includes two peer navigators.",68,,
321,0.97,4304.466,4310.939,They are designed to be role models and they are somebody with lived experience.,68,,
322,0.97,4310.939,4324.653,"That means somebody with either and existing mental illness, substance abuse disorder, or have had a crisis or issue within our system.",68,,
323,0.97,4324.653,4332.895,So they actually know what it's like to be on the receiving end of the crisis response.,68,,
324,0.97,4332.895,4341.97,The peer navigators are trained and provide information that really helped the client in their greatest moment of need.,68,,
325,0.97,4341.97,4358.52,They can speed speak to what it feels like and help Deescalate any situation.,68,,
326,0.97,4358.52,4361.657,The ultimate goal is preventing another crisis and getting treatment.,68,,
327,0.97,4361.657,4368.497,This start instead April and it will run through the end of December.,68,,
328,0.97,4368.497,4369.798,We are really excited.,68,,
329,0.97,4369.798,4371.567,It's up and running right now.,68,,
330,0.97,4371.567,4401.029,"I don't have any data yet because it's so new, but it's already providing that intensive follow-up with those individuals that they are encountering that are in some sort of mental health crisis.",68,,
331,0.97,4401.029,4410.139,We want to meet the individual where they're at and prevent the Overutilization of 911.,68,,
332,0.97,4410.139,4427.689,So does this address the issues that led to the crisis or the behavior that contributed to their high utilization of 911?,68,,
333,0.97,4427.689,4442.104,"How long does this pilot, which is focused on doing follow-up, or another crisis intervention helped previously?",69,,
334,0.97,4442.104,4450.445,I understood you to say there's a list created for the behavioral health response team to do ongoing visits.,69,,
335,0.97,4450.445,4463.692,How does that differ from the follow-up work that to ads case managers do for health one?,69,,
336,0.97,4463.692,4468.997,That's a really good question.,70,,
337,0.97,4468.997,4470.699,They're very similar.,70,,
338,0.97,4470.699,4477.639,The primary difference is the Avenue that the call comes in.,70,,
339,0.97,4477.639,4488.951,"The Avenue for this team, for the mental health professionals, it's primarily through law enforcement and our crisis response system.",70,,
340,0.97,4488.951,4518.547,"The ads case managers that work with our health one team, they are receiving all their calls through a call that comes into fire 911.",70,,
341,0.97,4582.611,4587.983,The division did end up being a little different.,70,,
342,0.97,4587.983,4595.757,Right now we don't know.,70,,
343,0.97,4595.757,4607.336,The County has informed us that they are committed to fund the crisis solution center.,70,,
344,0.97,4607.336,4611.106,But we'll have to wait and see how the revenue comes in.,70,,
345,0.97,4611.106,4613.609,Thank you.,71,,
346,0.97,4613.609,4639.468,"On the issue of a designated crisis Responder, I understand the local Christ team takes referrals from those responders, but has there been thought of putting a Responder on the team itself?",71,,
347,0.97,4639.468,4641.236,That's an interesting question.,72,,
348,0.97,4641.236,4656.718,I don't know if they have ever considered that.,72,,
349,0.97,4656.718,4674.036,We can ask the county if they have ever considered that.,72,,
350,0.97,4674.036,4723.852,"And the reason I ask, I think there's only four for the county and it's difficult I think throughout the county to get these responders to address the issues folks have when they are likely to have shown evidence that they have or will harm themselves or others.",73,,
351,0.97,4723.852,4736.231,Just looking to see if there are questions from Councilmembers here?,73,,
352,0.97,4736.231,4736.398,No.,73,,
353,0.97,4736.398,4737.332,"All right, thank you.",74,,
354,0.97,4737.332,4749.311,This is just providing an example of the work of our partnership with Seattle police Department and Desc for the crisis response team.,74,,
355,0.97,4749.311,4761.523,"Overall, all these investments are designed to meet people where they're at and respond to the crises in that moment.",74,,
356,0.97,4761.523,4768.23,We hope to prevent further entry into our criminal justice system.,74,,
357,0.97,4768.23,4772.601,I think next we have questions and answers.,74,,
358,0.97,4772.601,4777.172,That the really concludes our presentation.,75,,
359,0.97,4777.172,4778.94,We need to thank Andrea.,75,,
360,0.97,4778.94,4788.416,"Most of that was Scripted and she went off script, so I want to thank you for allowing us to come back.",75,,
361,0.97,4788.416,4790.952,We're happy to take any questions.,75,,
362,0.97,4790.952,4798.026,I have a question on the organization of the work within Hsd.,76,,
363,0.97,4798.026,4811.139,We have had the presentation to be safe and thriving communities division and heard about what functions are funded out of that division.,76,,
364,0.97,4811.139,4823.752,Is there any exploration within Hsd of moving the other functions we heard about today on into the safe and thriving communities division?,76,,
365,0.97,4823.752,4832.727,The good news is that soon we'll have the leadership and capacity to do a deep dive and look at our investments.,77,,
366,0.97,4832.727,4837.766,Of course we want to focus on the community at the center.,77,,
367,0.97,4837.766,4845.24,"If that makes sense, we can always have dotted lines too.",77,,
368,0.97,4845.24,4856.284,"We have some even within the safe and thriving Commission, so we'll explore all options, whatever makes sense without disruption.",77,,
369,0.97,4856.284,4856.585,Absolutely.,77,,
370,0.97,4856.585,4869.998,"I'm looking for a raised hand, not seeing any.",78,,
371,0.97,4869.998,4876.605,"So with that, I want to thank you for joining us.",78,,
372,0.97,4876.605,4897.659,"It was good to hear from you on all the work you're doing to help the crisis response on the street, and look forward to your ongoing work.",78,,
373,0.97,4897.659,4898.76,I remembered one other question.,78,,
374,0.97,4898.76,4916.878,I think it was supposed to be a study associated with the mobile crisis response team action?,78,,
375,0.97,4916.878,4939.034,"The agency that receives the funds should submit a report on how it was dispersed, so I want to be sure that doesn't get lost in the shuffle there.",78,,
376,0.97,4939.034,4945.106,"Yes, we'll be working with Desc and King County to provide a report.",79,,
377,0.97,4945.106,4949.01,We are aware.,79,,
378,0.97,4949.01,4952.714,All right.,80,,
379,0.97,4952.714,4963.091,I'd almost forgotten.,80,,
380,0.97,4979.374,4979.741,Great.,80,,
381,0.97,4979.741,4980.075,Thanks again.,80,,
382,0.97,4980.075,4981.009,Thank you for your work.,80,,
383,0.97,4981.009,4985.647,Thank you.,81,,
384,0.97,4985.647,4997.258,Please read in the next item.,82,,
385,0.97,4997.258,5009.738,"Item number 120105, ordinance relating Seattle police Department banning the ownership, purchase, rent, storage or use of less lethal weapons.",83,,
386,0.97,5009.738,5027.155,I think I'm just going to get to Lisa's presentation.,84,,
387,0.97,5027.155,5032.694,"Let me just real quickly, the legislation itself that's before us today has been introduced.",84,,
388,0.97,5032.694,5048.61,"This is the first version of the new bill that has actually been introduced on the introduction referral calendar as of this week, following the engagement with the U.S.",84,,
389,0.97,5048.61,5081.743,Disaster and consent decree monitor for use of force policies.,84,,
390,0.97,5081.743,5093.254,"We last voted on an Unintroduced bill, a motion to send the draft legislation to the monitor and the DOJ for their review.",84,,
391,0.97,5093.254,5098.293,We did that on February 9th.,84,,
392,0.97,5098.293,5136.698,Changes since then are designed to address the issues raised by the Department of justice and various court decisions.,84,,
393,0.97,5136.698,5146.574,We have received the recommendation before the budgets start in December.,84,,
394,0.97,5146.574,5152.38,There was a Roundtable discussion with SPD at the table.,84,,
395,0.97,5152.38,5166.628,The committee discussed a draft bill based on--we first amended the bill to make changes that reflect the things that the three accountability bodies Growed on.,84,,
396,0.97,5166.628,5173.635,"Since then, there have been meetings with the DOJ and monitor with feedback.",84,,
397,0.97,5173.635,5206.134,"During discussions of the bill, the Department also expressed concern about the potential that restricting the use of certain less lethal tools--and for the listening crowd, the terminology is not less than lethal, because we agree that in some instances, these tools have been lethal.",84,,
398,0.97,5206.134,5210.305,"The term is less lethal, meaning they are less likely to be all the Timal.",84,,
399,0.97,5210.305,5224.886,So I think that's the terminology we use to reflect that impact.,84,,
400,0.97,5224.886,5257.085,"The concern was that restricting the use of less than lethal tools couple lead to officers using higher levels of force, putting protesters at higher risk of harm.",84,,
401,0.97,5257.085,5293.354,The DOJ inquired whether this bill would provide time for changes in policy.,84,,
402,0.97,5293.354,5312.774,"This could have the Department of justice to challenge whatever legislation we pass, as they did in some aspects in 2017.",84,,
403,0.97,5312.774,5322.65,So there's a history of that occurring.,84,,
404,0.97,5322.65,5332.393,"That's different, for example, than the state Legislature, that's not under decree.",84,,
405,0.97,5332.393,5346.207,"That is sort of my goal for this bill and the context which we're operating in, and the history of this legislation going back to last year.",84,,
406,0.97,5346.207,5349.344,"With that, I will hand it over to Lisa for the presentation.",84,,
407,0.97,5453.247,5470.198,This bill restricts the use for other lethal weapons and they can only be used when the risk of serious bodily injury from actions is likely for bystanders.,85,,
408,0.97,5470.198,5479.44,This applies to all the weapons and all uses.,85,,
409,0.97,5479.44,5490.985,I'll walk through the four less lethal restricted weapons now.,85,,
410,0.97,5738.399,5762.022,So this allows the use of pepper spray outside a demonstration rally for purposes other than crowd control or for crowd control but only during a violent demonstration.,85,,
411,0.97,5762.022,5774.735,And police should have less lethal weapons available to respond to large groups within a crowd.,85,,
412,0.97,5774.735,5777.905,Section 1F regulates the use of Útear gas.,85,,
413,0.97,5777.905,5811.472,"S.W.A.T.Officers would be allowed to use tear gas outside a demonstration or rally only if it's necessary to prevent the loss of life or injury, and the risk of bodily injury must outweigh the risk to bystanders.",85,,
414,0.97,5811.472,5823.551,The bill also authorizes the use of tear gas at a demonstration or rally if five conditions were met.,85,,
415,0.97,5823.551,5838.966,Four were already in the draft and the fifth includes the risk to bodily injury must outweigh the risk to bystanders.,85,,
416,0.97,5838.966,5863.624,There are provisions that are the same as the February bill but have an added clause for clarity.,85,,
417,0.97,5863.624,5869.23,Section 10 has the same action as was in the February bill.,85,,
418,0.97,5869.23,5879.506,Sections two and three provide notice and implementation provisions similar to what was in the February bill.,85,,
419,0.97,5879.506,5919.68,Section four is new and directs the police Department to comply with this bill within 60 days after it takes effect and to publish effects on their Website.,85,,
420,0.97,5919.68,5931.892,This was responding to the Department of justice concern.,85,,
421,0.97,5932.259,5934.094,That COMPLETES my presentation.,85,,
422,0.97,5934.094,5935.663,Thank you.,86,,
423,0.97,5935.663,5944.438,"Before I accept questions, I'm wondering if you had a chance to listen in to public comment.",86,,
424,0.97,5944.438,5960.788,"There were a number of commentators who had concerns about changes in the bill, and I don't believe we have made any changes as it relates to the right of action for great parties.",86,,
425,0.97,5960.788,5978.172,I think what they are speaking to is that in February it was changed from what was proposed in the June 2020 bill.,87,,
426,0.97,5980.607,5983.277,Those were added too.,87,,
427,0.97,5983.277,6010.871,"The language in the 2020 bill was that injuries needed to have been--without a right of action, if you sustain injuries during a violent public disturbance, it would exclude the person from criminal offense.",87,,
428,0.97,6010.871,6029.79,"I mostly heard about the concerns that if the use of less lethal weapons occurred in something that was determined to be a violent public disturbance, that that individual would not have a right of action.",88,,
429,0.97,6029.79,6036.43,But a violent public disturbance is not something that somebody just arbitrarily decides.,88,,
430,0.97,6036.43,6040.267,"It has a legal definition in the law, correct?",88,,
431,0.97,6040.267,6040.968,That's correct.,89,,
432,0.97,6040.968,6068.829,It's defined in the bill as any gathering where 20 more appearance use or threaten to use unlawful violence against a person or group of people.,89,,
433,0.97,6068.829,6076.737,So there needs to have been use or threatening use of violence against other people.,89,,
434,0.97,6076.737,6086.88,Does this define who determines that there is a violent public disturbance?,90,,
435,0.97,6086.88,6101.095,"No, that's likely addressed in the police policies.",91,,
436,0.97,6101.095,6128.822,"I want to clarify, all the public speakers where are addressing the difference between what's being discussed today by this Committee and the actual real weapons ban that was voted for unanimously by the city council.",92,,
437,0.97,6128.822,6138.499,"So when we're talking about the actions, we're comparing this bill to the bill that was passed in the summer.",92,,
438,0.97,6138.499,6151.111,I don't think the committee should keep misleading the members of public by comparing this to the February draft.,92,,
439,0.97,6151.111,6161.221,"That was not an argument passed into law, so that means nothing.",92,,
440,0.97,6161.221,6165.993,People are comparing this action bill passed last summer by the counsel.,92,,
441,0.97,6165.993,6187.548,"We should also keep in mind that in terms of the violent public disturbance we were talking about, there are 12 or more people that could be violent and aggressive.",92,,
442,0.97,6187.548,6203.13,"It's public comment that we're talking about, the real life instances where people would not get addressed if this is passed into law.",92,,
443,0.97,6203.13,6207.968,I think that should be taken into consideration.,92,,
444,0.97,6207.968,6215.876,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",93,,
445,0.97,6215.876,6222.382,Any other thoughts?,93,,
446,0.97,6222.382,6248.742,"I would just call the committee's attention, as you're anticipating this, there's a chart on page 52 that provides a summary of how the weapons regulated in these various circumstances.",94,,
447,0.97,6248.742,6249.376,Thank you.,95,,
448,0.97,6249.376,6255.482,Really appreciate the time taken to put it together.,95,,
449,0.97,6255.482,6285.212,"And just to respond to why we are having a conversation that, um, focuses on the changes from a bill that a majority voted to send to the DOJ for their review to see what recommendation the DOJ made for changes.",95,,
450,0.97,6285.212,6300.961,This is our opportunity to do that.,95,,
451,0.97,6300.961,6304.965,"If there are no further questions, thank you so much for the presentation.",95,,
452,0.97,6304.965,6313.64,Thank you to my colleagues for being here to hear it.,95,,
453,0.97,6313.64,6320.981,"If there are no other questions or thoughts, we'll move into adjournment.",95,,
454,0.97,6320.981,6327.688,The next public safety Committee is scheduled for July 13th.,95,,
455,0.97,6327.688,6336.53,If there are no further comments from my colleagues?,95,,
456,0.97,6336.53,6339.566,The time is 11:16 A.M.,95,,
457,0.97,6339.566,6340.3,And we are adjourned.,95,,
458,0.97,6340.3,6341.435,Thank you so much.,95,,
