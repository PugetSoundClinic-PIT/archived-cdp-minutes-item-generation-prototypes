53,0.97,374.073,377.744,10 people killed by SPD since Seattle police account the system was put in place in 2017.,11,,
54,0.97,377.744,388.321,Zero is the number of officers held accountable it was also the number of policy changes and recommendations produced by Seattle so-called accountability partners and response.,11,,
55,0.97,388.321,408.207,79 is tiny number out of hundreds of cases of police abuse and demonstrators over the last year.,11,,
56,0.97,408.207,411.444,16 is the number of disciplinary actions taken so far by the SPD for these cases.,11,,
57,0.97,411.444,415.948,Is the number of disciplinary action so far that go beyond the written or oral Reprimand the egregious cases of police abuse.,11,,
58,0.97,415.948,418.751,10 months post George Floyd it's clear that the abuse cases avoid any accountability.,11,,
59,0.97,418.751,426.058,This lack of accountability is exacerbated by the community police Commission.,11,,
60,0.97,426.058,430.696,In February they held a poorly advertised meeting where for the first time in over six years they got on severed community feedback.,11,,
61,0.97,430.696,431.397,The feedback was overwhelming.,11,,
62,0.97,431.397,447.58,We need 100% civilian oversight of police yet one week later the CPC ignored the test me voting instead to recommend a in OPA investigations thereby keeping cops investigating cops.,11,,
63,0.97,447.58,469.969,Welcome to the ninth year of Seattle's so-called police accountability system where virtual Cigna thing is where community is if not outright ignored easily forgotten.,11,,
64,0.97,469.969,474.44,As we approach the one-year mark post George Floyd this complete lack of accountability will guarantee more abuse in the coming months.,11,,
65,0.97,474.44,479.579,Will need to focus our energy in creating full civilian control of police oversight moving beyond virtual signaling.,11,,

74,0.97,520.953,523.356,The Council committed to holding SPD accountable for spending twice in 2020.,13,,
75,0.97,523.356,536.335,"The Council unanimously approved 31962, Section 7 of which said the city council will not support any budget amendments to increase the SPD budget to offset overtime expenditures above the funds budgeted in 2020 or 2021.",13,,

77,0.97,557.29,566.666,To some degree they did not raise any objections or ask any questions about either of these budgets for accountability.,13,,
78,0.97,566.666,578.544,Councilmembers were proposing only cutting the 2021 budget I 2.8 million.,13,,
79,0.97,578.544,580.88,Roughly 1/2 of the 5.4 million SPD Overspent by in 2020.,13,,

81,0.97,592.224,596.495,That leaves 2.3 million for salary savings to spend on items for current priorities.,13,,
82,0.97,596.495,598.931,We don't have budget accountability and we don't have any accountability.,13,,
83,0.97,598.931,609.208,It needs to be amended to the full 5.4 million they Overspent by and give those funds to Participatory budgeting.,13,,

95,0.97,658.691,669.235,If the city of Seattle ask now and passes a resolution protecting medical practitioners who prescribed them it can demonstrate there's public appetite for change in the status quo.,17,,

147,0.97,936.635,952.351,My name is Danny and I'm a resident of district 3. I'm advocating in favor of a resolution that would Decriminalize Psychedelic plant medicine in Seattle.,25,,

153,0.97,983.282,1011.91,Seattle is a global leader in the Decriminalization and Legalization of Cannabis.,25,,
154,0.97,1011.91,1013.445,However it is falling behind on Psychedelics.,25,,
155,0.97,1013.445,1021.487,"Please allow Seattle to join a growing number of jurisdictions across the nation including Oakland, Washington, D.C., Oregon, Santa Cruz and Denver and others who Decriminalize Psychedelics and no longer Persecute Seattle residents who seek access to these healing plant medicines.",25,,
156,0.97,1021.487,1025.157,I urge the Council to adopt the resolution that would lower it to the lowest law enforcement priority.,25,,
