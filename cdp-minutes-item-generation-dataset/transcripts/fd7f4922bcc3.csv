97,0.97,777.81,780.88,"Sure, thank you.",24,,
98,0.97,780.88,787.186,"Good to see you director banks, I do have some opening remarks then I have several questions.",24,,
99,0.97,787.186,796.662,I think it's important to start by acknowledging the incredible work that Oed staff has done in the last year.,24,,
100,0.97,796.662,811.911,"You know, last year's especially the entire staff Pivoted toward writing technical assistance to small businesses for grants and loans.",24,,
101,0.97,811.911,823.122,Administers thousands of dollars in administration funds and I know the staff really absorbed a lot of the trauma that we're hearing from small business as they were having to lay off workers and having to figure out how they were going to survive.,24,,
102,0.97,823.122,835.401,So I think it's important to acknowledge that and to thank the entire staff for doing that very important work.,24,,
103,0.97,835.401,893.792,"I think the reason that it's important is because as a city and I can speak for myself, the Star is really around reducing the racial wealth gap in the city Six- . I think each Department needs to be strategic about advancing those goals and about how we're going to measure our progress toward those outcomes.",24,,
104,0.97,893.792,905.271,"So I do think it's important to acknowledge the Department Oed has experienced a lot of transition, interim director banks has been with us over the last year.",24,,
105,0.97,905.271,907.806,We did lose several work force development staff.,24,,
106,0.97,907.806,918.984,But I think even before that transition it hasn't been clear to me that there is kind of an over all city strategy for what Oeds should be doing.,24,,
107,0.97,918.984,924.123,There's not like an over all vision for how to be moving forward in that work.,24,,
108,0.97,924.123,960.225,"And so I just want to signal before I get to my questions, but for all these conversations that we're having with departments during this cycle, I'm going to be asking about what our city departments specifically are doing to achieve the outcomes that we're talking about wanting in terms of reducing racial Im disparities.",24,,
109,0.97,960.225,966.932,"So in terms of my questions, for the Department.",24,,
110,0.97,966.932,977.476,It appears that the office is going to be absorbed entirely into Oed.,24,,
111,0.97,977.476,978.477,It's not going to exist separately.,24,,
112,0.97,978.477,995.861,I'm sure this is going to cause some dismay amongst stake holders who are already frustrated that there hasn't been support to establish film Commission.,24,,
113,0.97,995.861,1003.068,"You sort of Referenced this director banks, another change I looks like Sdot will not absorb the cost.",24,,
114,0.97,1003.068,1010.075,So the city is likely going to have to raise permit fees.,24,,
115,0.97,1010.075,1024.49,Right now the only real incentive that the city offers to folks who want to film commercial or videos is we charge $25 a day for film permits for folks who need access to the right of way.,24,,
116,0.97,1024.49,1036.502,And so if Oed proposed to cover those costs in 2022 may have bought us some time.,24,,
117,0.97,1036.502,1037.669,This proposal does not include.,24,,
118,0.97,1037.669,1060.559,So if you can share with us what the implications will be with the new fees and what the impact will be on the industry that is trying to trying to find some support in the city.,24,,
119,0.97,1060.559,1071.103,Doctor banks if you're speaking you are muted.,25,,
120,0.97,1071.103,1071.37,I was.,26,,
121,0.97,1071.37,1075.474,And I want to thank the staff for the work they've done.,26,,
122,0.97,1075.474,1079.611,"To be clear, the office of music and film is not a separate office.",26,,
123,0.97,1079.611,1093.425,"That led to a lot of confusion in the community that is a lot of reasons why we're really, truly integrating it in saying that it is Oed is part of Oed.",26,,
124,0.97,1093.425,1097.229,Adding creative Industries into that is another thing we've been working on.,26,,
125,0.97,1097.229,1104.603,That's another work in progress for us.,26,,
126,0.97,1104.603,1107.806,It was never a separate office.,26,,
127,0.97,1107.806,1123.255,"It came off as that, we've been working on a Rebranding effort or integration of that on the film and permit side you are correct.",26,,
128,0.97,1123.255,1156.021,We in the city have been I will say eating the cost for the right of way film permits and they are very costly because of the Covid they were forced to look at ways to recover some of those costs.,26,,
129,0.97,1156.021,1161.059,We are definitely working on a permit review process using that money to do it in an equitable way.,26,,
130,0.97,1161.059,1176.575,There's been some suggestions that we have a fund for say Nonprofits or community based permits where they can get reduced costs but really charging the film industry the true cost of what it takes to close down city right of way.,26,,
131,0.97,1176.575,1189.955,One thing that I did learn in that process and that came from speaking to the producer of the last major film that was here.,26,,
132,0.97,1189.955,1216.181,It's going to be tough for the city to be considered a film because we don't have the tax bill that at Hrapb TA provides the film industry and that's Atlanta has on the film industry.,26,,
133,0.97,1216.181,1217.583,But tax breaks that brings film projects here.,26,,
134,0.97,1217.583,1230.295,I am going to work to make sure that the permit costs are covered and that we're not be inequitable to Nonprofits or local film producers that need access to the city right of way in that respect.,26,,
135,0.97,1230.295,1241.139,Director banks if I can just add a little bit to help add.,27,,
136,0.97,1241.139,1251.216,"A point of clarification, Sdot will be continuing to bare the cost of handling the reviews in 222.",27,,
137,0.97,1251.216,1266.331,It will be during 2022 that we review with them and with the community how to come up with a more equitable permit review solution so it won't be an immediate change.,27,,
138,0.97,1266.331,1279.544,This is something we're going to be looking at next year and will be coming back to the Council with a permit reform.,27,,
139,0.97,1279.544,1294.026,I look forward to working with you to see not just about this particular incentive as it's the only one we have right now but how we can actively support the film industry we do have here.,28,,
140,0.97,1294.026,1333.932,"So that we can make sure those creative, that creative sector, those practitioner and technically . It would be very helpful if you could help us understand what the vision is for that group and how they'll Workinterdepartmentally given that we have several departments that do developmental work already.",28,,
141,0.97,1333.932,1338.036,Can you speak to us what this group is intended to do.,28,,
142,0.97,1338.036,1344.076,If it can take down the slide so that we don't have the slide projector.,29,,
143,0.97,1344.076,1351.216,If a council member does have a question related to the slide we can definitely put that back up.,29,,
144,0.97,1351.216,1355.354,But for the discussion purposes we can take that down.,29,,
145,0.97,1355.354,1358.657,Council member Herbold I see you with your hand up.,29,,
146,0.97,1358.657,1361.927,I see you in the Cue.,29,,
147,0.97,1361.927,1364.296,Thank you very much Council member Morales.,29,,
148,0.97,1364.296,1365.43,Sorry to interrupt you Council member banks.,29,,
149,0.97,1365.43,1367.432,"No, thank you, thank you for that.",30,,
150,0.97,1367.432,1379.044,I can't tell you how excited we are about this commercial excitability.,30,,
151,0.97,1379.044,1388.453,As a way to create another way for Generatinal wealth.,30,,
152,0.97,1388.453,1401.867,"This Affordability program is one that major Murray put out, a report in 2016 that I happen to find in this office that I was like Whoa this is what we're really trying to do.",30,,
153,0.97,1401.867,1426.158,"Working with the office of planning community development we're really looking at taking this community, the commercial Affordability team and they will be looking at ensuring that when a business is getting ready to open or that they're in a space really trying to draw that they were able to draw by the actual building or the land under it so that it'll be generational.",30,,
154,0.97,1426.158,1449.181,So we're doing a deep dive and we have connected with the Cdfi that will have additional funding so while we can grant or do loans we can you our money to buy down the cost of a loan for a property or a business owner to actually buy their property.,30,,
155,0.97,1449.181,1457.522,"And this is really, really exciting.",30,,
156,0.97,1457.522,1480.212,I really want to give a shout out to Kim Yanakashi because we were able to open some black owned businesses during the pandemic because of this program.,30,,
157,0.97,1480.212,1485.917,So if you drive down you will see small African-American owned businesses.,30,,
158,0.97,1485.917,1491.256,You saw a couple of them in the slide presentation.,30,,
159,0.97,1491.256,1498.463,It's about where our other technical assistance programs is focusing just on tenant improvements.,30,,
160,0.97,1498.463,1502.634,Are they focusing on being able to do facade improvements things like this.,30,,
161,0.97,1502.634,1513.478,This commercial Affordability is really focused on the Businessowner being able to focus the business and property for a long term creation of generational wealth for their families.,30,,
162,0.97,1513.478,1513.979,It's really exciting.,30,,
163,0.97,1513.979,1525.991,So okay so that's helpful to know and I think there's several things that seem new.,31,,
164,0.97,1525.991,1541.106,So let me go through a couple of these because I'm trying to see how these are interconnected and what the city is doing through other departments.,31,,
165,0.97,1541.106,1549.681,The small ownership fund is a new thing here as well.,31,,
166,0.97,1549.681,1577.642,"One of the things we regularly hear from our small business district associations is the need for a reduction and the burden placed by them by city departments or fee processes, or multiple fee processes especially when it's from a small pot that they have to apply for over and over again.",31,,
167,0.97,1577.642,1584.249,I'm worried that this is creating a burden a new process for one.,31,,
168,0.97,1584.249,1592.958,I'm trying to understand what exactly is the target here.,31,,
169,0.97,1592.958,1598.83,Can you just talk to me a little bit about what the goal is here?,31,,
170,0.97,1598.83,1611.476,I think what makes this unique is we're Partnering with Cdefis that are already in the neighborhoods that understand that business area correct.,32,,
171,0.97,1611.476,1612.777,That's the difference.,32,,
172,0.97,1612.777,1619.884,So we're not creating anything new.,32,,
173,0.97,1619.884,1631.863,What we're doing is creating access to capital that before our black and Brown communities did not have access to.,32,,
174,0.97,1631.863,1635.6,Having property where by they can take down if cost of the loan.,32,,
175,0.97,1635.6,1646.011,It can be in a new development or in an existing structure right.,32,,
176,0.97,1646.011,1651.716,That's the real big difference.,32,,
177,0.97,1651.716,1656.187,There's nobody in the neighborhood doing this.,32,,
178,0.97,1656.187,1660.625,Focusing on the black and indigenous people of color area.,32,,
179,0.97,1660.625,1671.269,"This recommendation came from the equitable task force that did a lot of meetings and resource and again was really a way for them to say Hey, this is not just a home.",32,,
180,0.97,1671.269,1673.705,Ownership is definitely a path for generational wealth.,32,,
181,0.97,1673.705,1679.511,Business ownership is that as well.,32,,
182,0.97,1679.511,1684.949,How is this different from the strategies with Edi and shift for example.,33,,
183,0.97,1684.949,1692.424,That's when I say I feel that we're creating one or two or three things doing the same thing so I'm just trying to understand.,33,,
184,0.97,1692.424,1695.56,"After this, Ma'am I just have one more question then I will wrap up.",33,,
185,0.97,1695.56,1699.964,Amanda will you take that question please.,34,,
186,0.97,1699.964,1709.074,"Sure, council member Morales you're referring to sift Seattle investment fund.",35,,
187,0.97,1709.074,1709.841,Okay.,35,,
188,0.97,1709.841,1723.922,"How it's different than Edi is that focus is really working on community based organizations where our focus is going to be working on, working with small businesses.",35,,
189,0.97,1723.922,1732.197,And specifically focusing in on black and Brown small businesses.,35,,
190,0.97,1732.197,1736.234,The Seattle investment fund Unfortunately is winding down its Existance.,35,,
191,0.97,1736.234,1745.91,They have a little bit of money left yet to spend but not that much.,35,,
192,0.97,1745.91,1758.59,"In fact, our budget includes $90,000 reduction in the contribution fund because those projects are wrapping up and anticipating to be wrapping up at the end of next year.",35,,
193,0.97,1758.59,1769.033,Unfortunately that's not a source that we'll be able to turn to in a the successful way.,35,,
194,0.97,1769.033,1772.203,"Okay, one last question.",36,,
195,0.97,1772.203,1777.742,I'm trying to wrap my head around our work force development as a city.,36,,
196,0.97,1777.742,1786.785,"I think five or six other departments, we have work force development funding and seven different departments.",36,,
197,0.97,1786.785,1789.788,It doesn't seem we have a coherent strategy given all those different pieces.,36,,
198,0.97,1789.788,1805.27,"Can you tell us if there is an Overarching strategy as it relates to work force development and how, what you're doing at Oed connects to what we're doing in all the other departments.",36,,
199,0.97,1805.27,1811.743,So this is a cluster tragedy approach in that we would call for work force development.,37,,
200,0.97,1811.743,1816.714,We're working with the other Department looking tat key industries piece of it.,37,,
201,0.97,1816.714,1837.268,So what key industries are providing jobs and where we fit in . I am really knowing that the city as a whole I would love and want to work with you toward this on having Oed leads really work force development.,37,,
202,0.97,1837.268,1842.173,Because what some of the other departments are doing is a true meaning and sense of work force.,37,,
203,0.97,1842.173,1849.48,So what I'm looking for in 2022 is definitely establishing a clear relationship with our Seattle King County work force development Council.,37,,
204,0.97,1849.48,1858.957,Because some of these strategies and some of what I've learned is coming out of a downtown working group from Covid recovery.,37,,
205,0.97,1858.957,1880.745,So I want to let you know I had a planning session yesterday with some key stake holders that work in work force development and I'm very excited about the potential of us really blowing up work force and really everybody understanding the true meaning of what work force is and what it looks like.,37,,
206,0.97,1880.745,1892.657,But inside the city of Seattle with the cluster strategy and key industry I do believe the city should take the lead in that.,37,,
207,0.97,1892.657,1911.876,We're trying to ensure that we have a work force in planning training opportunity to get in those key industries to key in on those developments.,37,,
208,0.97,1911.876,1915.179,So we're Keying in on work force developments.,37,,
209,0.97,1915.179,1921.653,I have one more question.,38,,
210,0.97,1921.653,1927.925,The strategic advisor position is gone and I'm sure that's tied to some of the other conversations of Oed.,38,,
211,0.97,1927.925,1936.501,But can you tell me how that will affect the work that has been done in collaboration with the arts Department.,38,,
212,0.97,1936.501,1941.306,It's not gone it's been Reclassed.,39,,
213,0.97,1941.306,1950.081,So we are still going to hire a creative Art/Core manager and that's going to happen.,39,,
214,0.97,1950.081,1960.191,"Again that person, we have a consultant we're working for Ryan Donahugh right now.",39,,
215,0.97,1960.191,1970.401,"We're waiting to make sure that when that position is Reposted, we have what skills that person really needs.",39,,
216,0.97,1970.401,1977.875,We hope to have that position posted at the end of the year to lead that work.,39,,
217,0.97,1977.875,1981.212,Thank you.,40,,
218,0.97,1981.212,1983.348,Thank you Council member Morales.,41,,
219,0.97,1983.348,1991.99,That was an excellent example of what we're hoping to do during this presentation.,41,,
220,0.97,1991.99,1996.361,This is a great opportunity for those chairs to lead off with some questions.,41,,
221,0.97,1996.361,2001.332,Definitely have a chance to ask more questions at the end but thank you for initiating the line of questioning today.,41,,
222,0.97,2001.332,2003.401,And Council member Herbold I see you up next.,41,,
223,0.97,2003.401,2010.274,Others on the Cue I will make sure to give you a call just raise your hand on the hand function.,41,,
224,0.97,2010.274,2019.784,I'm glad we can be the Guinea pigs that this is working.,42,,
225,0.97,2019.784,2020.051,Thanks.,42,,
226,0.97,2020.051,2020.318,Great.,43,,
227,0.97,2020.318,2021.119,Thank you so much.,43,,
228,0.97,2021.119,2026.691,You may have answered one of my questions there at the end.,43,,
229,0.97,2026.691,2046.31,As a little bit of background I think it's really important to recognize that the creative economy study found that here in Seattle the creative sector drives a full 18% of our city's Dp.,43,,
230,0.97,2046.31,2048.212,That's four times the national average.,43,,
231,0.97,2048.212,2054.652,You know we do have a film incentive program.,43,,
232,0.97,2054.652,2059.357,It is not as big as that in other States but we do have an incentive program.,43,,
233,0.97,2059.357,2073.07,So I'm really so happy to see the proposed budget document from Oed recognizes the creative industries that among the industry that Oed leads.,43,,
234,0.97,2073.07,2076.908,I want to highlight the Oed web page.,43,,
235,0.97,2076.908,2082.38,It does not seem to have creative Industries listed.,43,,
236,0.97,2082.38,2098.463,"And that was, that's new in the past under the previous administration creative Industries was called out as a prime economic sector on the Oeds web page.",43,,
237,0.97,2098.463,2117.849,So plan to flag that because I think it sends an inconsistent message that we want to make sure that we're Uplifting this particular factor.,43,,
238,0.97,2117.849,2124.455,"What I think I heard, the creative Industries director is included in the proposed budget, is that accurate?",43,,
239,0.97,2124.455,2124.722,Yes.,44,,
240,0.97,2124.722,2160.324,"And Council member Herbold I want to say this, that the creative energy strategy work it builds off our Postresearch that was done with the community and the community Website is under construction I'm going to, tell you a little personal, our Comps director had major surgery so we're a little behind but but she promises to be caught up by the end of the year.",44,,
241,0.97,2160.324,2160.658,Excellent.,45,,
242,0.97,2160.658,2169.033,Understanding that and as Council member Morales said it on her opening remark.,45,,
243,0.97,2169.033,2189.954,"I know folks at Oed have been doing a lot of Covid related relief work and really, really appreciate everything that everybody is doing in the midst of having as you say their own cry cease to deal with as well.",45,,
244,0.97,2189.954,2208.172,"So totally understand, appreciate the acknowledge that, that that Website as it is now does not really reflect the totality of the business sectors that we want to lift up.",45,,
245,0.97,2208.172,2216.814,"Two real quick questions, one related specifically to Oed small business relief.",45,,
246,0.97,2216.814,2249.313,Prior to Covid was a small business stabilization fund but it was very focused on making it possible for small businesses to apply for funding to address unanticipated situations whether or not it was negative impacts of a transportation project that was making it hard for people to impact their business.,45,,
247,0.97,2249.313,2260.091,The stabilization fund would support those businesses with grants to help them stay open during the period of construction.,45,,
248,0.97,2260.091,2265.196,"Similarly, small businesses that were eligible they were the victim of a crime.",45,,
249,0.97,2265.196,2270.334,Somebody threw a rock through their store front window.,45,,
250,0.97,2270.334,2282.346,Could if they're eligible they could apply for funding to address those unanticipated expenses.,45,,
251,0.97,2282.346,2300.331,I'm wondering do we expect to be able to have the business Stabilityization funds to pivot back to those needs.,45,,
252,0.97,2300.331,2302.066,Not in the next year.,46,,
253,0.97,2302.066,2308.873,We're going to be focused on recovery.,46,,
254,0.97,2308.873,2311.909,What I can say through the direct allocations.,46,,
255,0.97,2311.909,2316.113,That they can use the money to do those sort of things.,46,,
256,0.97,2316.113,2317.481,The graffiti and lighting.,46,,
257,0.97,2317.481,2324.722,I can get back to you on some further details to answer some questions.,46,,
258,0.97,2324.722,2354.418,"The focus is on the economic recovery and using the money that we have done direct allocations to though business districts to have funding around if there's a, you know a major graffiti or do it through what they call clean cities and things like that to ensure the business district and the businesses held in those districts have access to that kind of funding for repair and clean up, so.",46,,
259,0.97,2354.418,2354.719,Amanda.,47,,
260,0.97,2354.719,2358.622,I'm so sorry.,48,,
261,0.97,2358.622,2361.425,Amanda can add to that.,49,,
262,0.97,2361.425,2369.333,"In the, in the 2021 budget we do have an allocation for small business stabilization fund.",50,,
263,0.97,2369.333,2376.107,"And that, and that fund will, would be used.",50,,
264,0.97,2376.107,2389.653,"We're opening an application period I think early in October, mid-October, and that funding can be used for capital.",50,,
265,0.97,2389.653,2395.493,It's not what you're Referencing as broken windows and that sort of stuff.,50,,
266,0.97,2395.493,2398.529,As the stabilization fund had been developed for.,50,,
267,0.97,2398.529,2424.355,We definitely because of Covid and because of the needs we're seeing in the community have opened it up a bit wider and allowing people to use it obviously if they're dealing with those extreme circumstances and unfortunate circumstances like you're mentioning they can use their grant award for that.,50,,
268,0.97,2424.355,2427.091,And it's really intended for operating capital.,50,,
269,0.97,2427.091,2429.96,And hopefully I was able to respond to you.,50,,
270,0.97,2429.96,2449.313,You may recall that this fund was originally established back when they're sort of phased projects and one-half of the street was closed for a really long period of time.,51,,
271,0.97,2449.313,2460.024,The other part of street was closed for another period of time and people there were suffering because people weren't able to access their businesses.,51,,
272,0.97,2460.024,2474.505,That's sort of how it all started and it expanded to unplanned events like defensive crime and those sorts of things and now Covid happened.,51,,
273,0.97,2474.505,2475.539,And appreciate having that additional detail.,51,,
274,0.97,2475.539,2480.911,I wanted to show a question if I may.,51,,
275,0.97,2480.911,2484.248,To touch on that previous point.,52,,
276,0.97,2484.248,2489.186,On the example of the 23rd.,52,,
277,0.97,2489.186,2492.69,One of the things that we focused is Federal money.,52,,
278,0.97,2492.69,2498.729,One of the things we've been able to do is target the Federal dollars.,52,,
279,0.97,2498.729,2507.771,Not acknowledges this isn't an area of interest and one that I believe can be frustrating.,52,,
280,0.97,2507.771,2511.509,"I just wanted to highlight that point, thank you.",52,,
281,0.97,2511.509,2525.089,"I think it's, is it, it was a good use of those Cbdg dollars it did create some frustrations though because it created a need for businesses to be income eligible to access them.",53,,
282,0.97,2525.089,2529.96,So that meant a lot of businesses who had impacts weren't eligible to.,53,,
283,0.97,2529.96,2531.595,But it was still better than nothing.,53,,
284,0.97,2531.595,2539.87,One of the reasons that it worked in the 23rd example is that was an area that it was eligible geographical.,54,,
285,0.97,2539.87,2551.849,"So again, it was a bit of a one off recognizing, it was there to recognize that the present would be one that would be hard to manage but one that was also necessary.",54,,
286,0.97,2551.849,2558.422,"And then, Ma'am chairman may I ask a question.",55,,
287,0.97,2558.422,2558.656,Thanks.,55,,
288,0.97,2558.656,2587.017,Shifting over to the fits and starts efforts around legacy businesses we were on the verge of launching a legacy program when Covid hit.,55,,
289,0.97,2587.017,2592.289,Really appreciate your predecessor Lee.,55,,
290,0.97,2592.289,2598.963,"I understand there's $60,000 on the proposed budget is set aside.",55,,
291,0.97,2598.963,2618.315,But there's also a note that funding can be put among the alternatives to see when this decision will be and will be placed under can consideration.,55,,
292,0.97,2618.315,2619.55,Amanda will take that.,56,,
293,0.97,2619.55,2621.285,She's there before me.,56,,
294,0.97,2621.285,2622.987,It's a great question Council member.,57,,
295,0.97,2622.987,2635.466,And I think the main thing that we're looking at as we're looking at all of these new investments is really looking at what the greatest needs are in the community.,57,,
296,0.97,2635.466,2650.114,"And responding to those who are most impacted by the pandemic and so, I think at this moment the intention is given all the other investments to be able to move forward with the legacy business program.",57,,
297,0.97,2650.114,2670.334,And we didn't want to falsely promise anything to the Council wanting to be able to spend some time to really look at the investments that we have and how we can get that out the door and serve though most impacted.,57,,
298,0.97,2670.334,2679.276,"So, there's not a formal past to be administers to say that if we meet this threshold we'll definitely move forward with legacy business.",57,,
299,0.97,2679.276,2690.754,We just need a little more time to see how we can best serve those most impacted.,57,,
300,0.97,2690.754,2696.427,Thank you very much.,58,,
301,0.97,2696.427,2698.662,Small question from Council member Herbold.,58,,
302,0.97,2698.662,2700.664,Something I've been trying Toplug along.,59,,
303,0.97,2700.664,2710.441,"I think folks know since day one of my first term, in legacy this isn't just businesses for our purpose.",59,,
304,0.97,2710.441,2713.377,Businesses have been around for a long time.,59,,
305,0.97,2713.377,2723.087,The program that we've been working and developing are specifically legacy businesses that are considered cultural anchors.,59,,
306,0.97,2723.087,2736.2,"They are small businesses, and businesses that we want to value because of their cultural contributions to the business, they've been here for a long time.",59,,
307,0.97,2736.2,2748.445,I think there's been a lot of alignment even in Covid recovery around wanting to have some focus on these types of businesses and honestly we're there now.,59,,
308,0.97,2748.445,2758.455,Two Council members asked questions about the creative industry positions and I just want to be clear that we're all on the same page.,60,,
309,0.97,2758.455,2769.867,So Oed in 2021 had a creative industry director and Astrategic advisor three and a creative advisor two.,60,,
310,0.97,2769.867,2788.519,What we're proposing with the 2022 work term is we will take that creative industry two advisor position and Reallocate it with that goal.,60,,
311,0.97,2788.519,2792.523,We're Reallocating the creative industry director as our new division director.,60,,
312,0.97,2792.523,2814.945,And that division director position is one that we really feel strongly we're going to need particularly given the level of investment that Oed is seeing currently and will continue to see into next year where we have 100% increase from this year to next year.,60,,
313,0.97,2814.945,2824.521,200% for next year and seeing over sight over that work that we're delivering on.,60,,
314,0.97,2824.521,2828.225,Hope that's helpful.,60,,

379,0.97,3328.658,3342.105,As you already talked about Council member Mosqueda just kicking off in in Ernest a green new green deal.,77,,
380,0.97,3342.105,3355.885,We can go do the next slide which is an overview of Oses the changes between the 2021 adopted budget and our 2022 proposed budget.,77,,
381,0.97,3355.885,3363.96,There's over all a net addition of $3.3 million from the 2021 adopted budget.,77,,
382,0.97,3363.96,3373.103,Our budget includes appropriations from the sweet and beverage tax and new adds from the payroll tax which we'll walk through in a bit.,77,,
383,0.97,3373.103,3385.882,I just want to know we've all been adjusting and adapting and doing different things during this Covid Crisissome of the things that you've seen that have been adopted and revised.,77,,
384,0.97,3385.882,3410.106,Some of the Red is some backing out of Covid related energy feeding with emergency vouching programs in Seattle schools with healthy fruits and vegetables for Seattle families in schools.,77,,
385,0.97,3410.106,3419.482,And we have ose with new investments to deliver to climate investments.,77,,
386,0.97,3419.482,3421.785,We can move to the next slide.,77,,
387,0.97,3421.785,3425.755,This is some of the highlights of some of the investments.,77,,
388,0.97,3425.755,3450.413,"As our city continues to really grapple with Covid-19 in responding to a lot of complex community challenges, council member Mosqueda pointed out we are seeing the harmful impacts of climate change.",77,,
389,0.97,3450.413,3463.56,And we are excited that the governor is introducing new measures to spur clean energy opportunities for those harm first and worse by the pandemic as well as the climate crisis.,77,,
390,0.97,3463.56,3480.51,"So in particular, key -L additions are focused in two climate justice areas.",77,,
391,0.97,3480.51,3484.747,The first is the swami project.,77,,
392,0.97,3484.747,3495.525,Just over $8 million to really deliver on the promise of the Dwamish the project.,77,,
393,0.97,3495.525,3501.731,And this is to get the work off the ground and up and running after a long time.,77,,
394,0.97,3501.731,3518.681,"This is a community call for action, immediate action to transition Seattle away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy and to do so by investing in impacted communities and clean energy jobs.",77,,
395,0.97,3518.681,3526.022,And so Oses budget includes an addition of $3.6 million as part of a 14 plus million dollars plus green investment.,77,,
396,0.97,3526.022,3551.08,I also wanted to note this is not in ose's budget but part of the Mayor's budget over sight board which is a 19 board and that board is up and running so that money will be ready for recommendation when they're ready for that.,77,,
397,0.97,3551.08,3554.517,I want to note here at the end briefly.,77,,
398,0.97,3554.517,3558.288,The ose budget continues to support some of the core programs we run.,77,,
399,0.97,3558.288,3559.956,Some of those are highlighted here below.,77,,
400,0.97,3559.956,3576.739,We wanted to call out some exciting news that we're about to launch of new fresh bucks incentive program.,77,,
401,0.97,3576.739,3625.188,"That'Sthat's going to allow people to go to retailers and use their fresh bucks . a little framing here, the first five items we're going to walk through are part of the development.",77,,
402,0.97,3634.764,3647.076,To really expand youth development in the valley with a focus on the career.,77,,
403,0.97,3647.076,3650.947,They're the youth core and the Skwrorpbl youth Council.,77,,
404,0.97,3650.947,3670.066,"This program is changing lives I've been out on the field with some of them and just been totally inspired they're on the ground training and work to grow food, and to advance environmental justice and the resilience is really inspiring.",77,,
405,0.97,3670.066,3681.244,The second investment I just within the to highlight we saw it with the last organization.,77,,
406,0.97,3681.244,3685.715,Ose has been providing Covid relief and direct assistance in Georgetown to businesses there.,77,,
407,0.97,3685.715,3693.322,And that's really built on a lot of the partnerships we've established.,77,,
408,0.97,3693.322,3701.931,"The second investment of $275,000 will really build on these partnership and help businesses overcome some of the current challenges they're still facing in this new normal.",77,,
409,0.97,3701.931,3710.773,Trying to operate in a kind of Crazy world that seems to always be changing and definitely how businesses are interacting with customers changing at well.,77,,
410,0.97,3710.773,3716.145,We will definitely be looking to coordinate this work with the office of development as well.,77,,
411,0.97,3716.145,3724.454,I wanted to note this investment is part of a strategy to facilitate some local procurement and local contracting opportunities.,77,,
412,0.97,3724.454,3755.751,"We've been in contact with our Finance and administrative services Department that does procurement and to really look at ways that as new investments are coming into the valley, there are millions of dollars of capital projects that are coming into this community like how do we connect those local businesses to those opportunities and spur greater local economic development.",77,,
413,0.97,3755.751,3758.588,The third item will target nature.,77,,
414,0.97,3758.588,3775.705,We know that trees and nature bring a lot of benefits storm water management and we also know these areas in our city tend to have lower tree canopy cover and hotter temperatures during extreme heat waves as we've seen in the last two summers.,77,,
415,0.97,3775.705,3795.291,So this investment really builds on ongoing community action to green communities and response to key recommendations in the industrial Ameritime strategy as well as urban forest management program.,77,,
416,0.97,3795.291,3800.396,We can turn to the next slide.,77,,
417,0.97,3800.396,3804.4,So getting on the worse force conversation.,77,,
418,0.97,3804.4,3816.946,"I want to the next proposed investment of $275,000 is really looking to action things that we have heard as key recommendations in recent work force reports.",77,,
419,0.97,3816.946,3827.824,So I wanted to highlight the fossil fuel transitions study and there's two Seattle jobs initiatives that have come out really focused on clean energy work force.,77,,
420,0.97,3827.824,3860.022,So ose is working to work Inpartnership with the office of economic development with Finance and development services that do a lot of apprenticeship work with Seattle city light who is looking to bring on new staff as part of Electrify Kaeugs Electrification how we can move forward around priority hire with an initial focus.,77,,
421,0.97,3860.022,3873.369,There's a lot of powerful partnerships that we have already created through this work and we think there's opportunity to create on those partnerships and get this money moving quickly.,77,,
422,0.97,3873.369,3886.983,The last investment related to the green new deal is a proposed investment of a million dollars to pilot investments to study diesel emissions and pollution.,77,,
423,0.97,3886.983,3901.097,This is really a focus on engaging small and independent operators that may Needadditional assistance to convert to green energy.,77,,
424,0.97,3901.097,3912.642,This is part of work we're doing right now and conversations that Seattle has had with Seattle public schools.,77,,
425,0.97,3912.642,3923.252,It's really a key goal of Seattle's Electrify Electrification and try to reduce those health impacts.,77,,
426,0.97,3923.252,3930.793,And I really want to give a shout out to our friends at Seattle light for their leadership.,77,,
427,0.97,3930.793,3944.206,They really stepped in on how we connect E Electrification and they're key partners for us in this as well.,77,,
428,0.97,3944.206,3949.045,I want to thank them for some staff capacity.,77,,
429,0.97,3949.045,3957.42,It's a budget neutral item but we're sharing the position to help bring some of this work together.,77,,
430,0.97,3957.42,3957.653,Okay.,77,,
431,0.97,3957.653,3979.275,So moving on I'm turning away from the investments and turning toward the green new deal investments this financial budget I'm going to talk about are part of the mayors $3.3 million investment package to advance the green new deal.,77,,
432,0.97,3979.275,3988.384,It includes 6.2 million that is not in budget.,77,,
433,0.97,3988.384,3996.659,And really leverage opportunities to put these investments to work immediately as part of this equitable transition.,77,,
434,0.97,3996.659,3999.128,"So the first investment is proposed addition of $320,000.",77,,
435,0.97,3999.128,4018.447,And that will help under Resourced businesses and building owners take advantage of some special incentives that are just available through the clean buildings act to establish building standards for large commercial buildings across the state.,77,,
436,0.97,4018.447,4022.985,Ose through the Benchmarking work and tune UPS work we've been doing.,77,,
437,0.97,4022.985,4031.36,There's about a thousand buildings in our city that will need to make energy improvements in order to comply with this law in the coming years.,77,,
438,0.97,4031.36,4039.135,Keen on working in partnership with Seattle city light and with community partners to engage some of these under Resourced businesses.,77,,
439,0.97,4039.135,4042.805,Some of these community based organizations.,77,,
440,0.97,4042.805,4060.189,Some of them providing critical community services in disadvantages Communitys to really leverage these early incentives available before the regulation kicks in and help them one comply early and two even go beyond compliance toward Electrification.,77,,
441,0.97,4060.189,4063.626,We can move on to the next slide.,77,,
442,0.97,4063.626,4092.354,"So investment number seven, this is a proposed investment of $200,000 and this will fund heat oil converse rebates and Provideinvestment in black indigenous people of color communities and under served communities.",77,,
443,0.97,4092.354,4097.293,1.5 going to the office of housing for this convergence.,77,,
444,0.97,4097.293,4128.19,This one time funding is really designed to really keep us the city and our program on all of us on track with providing funding essential funding to help residents convert from dirty oil to electric heat pumps therefor reducing carbon pollution and providing comfort and cooling and it's really designed to provide gap funding as we have delayed the oil heating tax during the pandemic.,77,,
445,0.97,4128.19,4132.828,"Investment number eight, this is the environmental justice Fund.",77,,
446,0.97,4132.828,4137.833,Some of our climate justice work is Impacting Communitys to lead on solutions.,77,,
447,0.97,4137.833,4139.168,This has been a really successful program.,77,,
448,0.97,4139.168,4144.54,Grant program that we've had in place for several years.,77,,
449,0.97,4144.54,4149.378,"This proposed add of $550,000 will sustain a 2021 this year tripling of the environmental justice Fund.",77,,
450,0.97,4149.378,4155.851,This was a really exciting opportunity for us and that was a recommendation of the equitable community investment task force.,77,,
451,0.97,4155.851,4162.491,I just want to say the demand for funds like this is very high.,77,,
452,0.97,4162.491,4181.677,"Ose just closed the office of Sustainability environment just closed the 2021 grant round and received 45 proposals requesting well over $2 million for the $750,000 that's available to Disburse.",77,,
453,0.97,4181.677,4189.451,And the last really leveraged $1 million of Covid relief fund for clean energy training scholarships.,77,,
454,0.97,4189.451,4209.672,We know that black indigenous and people of color communities are impacted by the Covid crisis and green energy.,77,,
455,0.97,4209.672,4215.811,That brought the need to train workers in green projects and in electricity production.,77,,
456,0.97,4215.811,4220.316,And so this funding will provide scholarships for training and career prep.,77,,
457,0.97,4220.316,4227.189,"And ose will definitely work closely with our partners, Seattle city light, Finance and administrative services as I mentioned.",77,,
458,0.97,4227.189,4237.967,The Office of economic development and a number of work force partners to put these resources in the hands of people who need it most immediately.,77,,
459,0.97,4237.967,4238.834,Turning to our final slide.,77,,
460,0.97,4238.834,4250.079,Just wanted to close by under scoring that Oses ongoing commitment to racial equity you know our work is guided like every Department in this city by the city's race and social justice initiative.,77,,

462,0.97,4261.79,4286.715,Approximately 90% of the budget adds that I just walked you through will impact community in reducing fossil fuels and Accessing clean energy jobs as well as making strategic investments in the valley.,77,,
463,0.97,4286.715,4298.093,That's an area that's been disproportionately harmed from climate change in the climate crisis.,77,,
464,0.97,4298.093,4303.332,We're really deepening our commercial work.,77,,
465,0.97,4303.332,4312.007,"Lived experience, connection to impacted Communitys to really bringing those voices into our office in our hiring practices and on our leadership team.",77,,
466,0.97,4312.007,4315.611,Osc has a race and social justice change team as many departments do in this city.,77,,
467,0.97,4315.611,4321.95,And that is a group of staff committed to internal racial equity work.,77,,
468,0.97,4321.95,4328.791,And they've been engaged in our hiring practices in all of our hiring in the past year.,77,,
469,0.97,4328.791,4343.205,As well as in our 2021 or 2022 budgeting as and facilitating a learning culture within our office.,77,,
470,0.97,4343.205,4345.541,A racial equity working.,77,,
471,0.97,4345.541,4355.384,I want to note our proposed budget has some cuts to our budget to add training.,77,,
472,0.97,4355.384,4359.788,We will continue team building.,77,,
473,0.97,4359.788,4363.125,That is the end of the formal presentation.,77,,
474,0.97,4363.125,4363.926,I look forward to a conversation.,77,,
475,0.97,4363.926,4364.727,Thank you so much.,77,,
476,0.97,4364.727,4368.197,Thank you so much for walking us through this presentation.,78,,
477,0.97,4368.197,4385.481,"I know there's a few questions, I'm going to start with Council member Sawant as chair of the economy that deals with environmental justice I will turn it over to you first and then we will take questions from other Council members.",78,,
478,0.97,4385.481,4386.048,Thank you.,79,,
479,0.97,4386.048,4392.688,Thank you Michelle and all the staff at the office of Sustainability and environment.,79,,
480,0.97,4392.688,4416.412,"I first just want to acknowledge all the work that is being done by community members, by the environmental organization to accomplish if new green deal oversight board.",79,,
481,0.97,4416.412,4424.686,That was one of the most important tasks that the Renters committee took up this year.,79,,
482,0.97,4424.686,4440.202,"I think that the individuals who have been appointed as a group, as a board together I think they are very serious in their commitment to help address climate change.",79,,
483,0.97,4440.202,4456.218,"And so I think, I'm hoping the role they will play will be akin if not everyone more important to akin to the role of the city of Seattle Renters Commission who played a tremendous role in helping to push forward Renters rights.",79,,
484,0.97,4456.218,4466.695,So I'm really looking forward to the work from the green new deal oversight board.,79,,
485,0.97,4466.695,4494.089,"And most importantly, I'm hoping the over sight board will bring more and more important ideas on how we can really emphasize that climate change will not be addressed unless the labor movement is helping to lead on it and bringing in the question of transition front and center and not just talk about it but actually you know bring in ideas for how Seattle can do that for example as a starting point.",79,,
486,0.97,4494.089,4515.244,"And I want to thank everyone in the city council staff and also my own staff members who did a tremendous amount of work in order to help establish that board, we're really glad it is finally staffed now after some obstacles.",79,,
487,0.97,4515.244,4526.388,"But having said that, my questions are all, and also to give an example of what in fact, the green new deal oversight board can have.",79,,
488,0.97,4526.388,4547.209,"As Council members have heard from my comments, at Monday morning briefings one of the pieces of legislation that my office has on the board alongside the environmental justice community and also some of the members of the green new deal office board itself are divesting from insurance corporations involved Inprojects.",79,,
489,0.97,4547.209,4553.382,That alone is not going to go far enough but it's important and an example of what more needs to be done.,79,,
490,0.97,4553.382,4563.926,I really appreciate the information on the funding of various programs in your presentation in each and every one of the programs is extremely important.,79,,
491,0.97,4563.926,4571.3,And my office will have more questions on the specific programs and funding of specific programs as the days go by.,79,,
492,0.97,4571.3,4591.653,As we look more into it but right now my question is more about how well Seattle is doing in terms of addressing the existing threat to life on our planet.,79,,
493,0.97,4591.653,4608.17,It wouldn't be correct to say we're increasing the budget compared to last year that's important but the crucial question crisis we're facing is what is the funding going to look like.,79,,
494,0.97,4608.17,4611.74,I think it's really crucial we frame it that way.,79,,
495,0.97,4611.74,4621.383,"And then one, I think that all of the work of the office of Sustainability and environment in my view should be framed from that standpoint.",79,,
496,0.97,4621.383,4626.989,What is the scale that's necessary and where we are.,79,,
497,0.97,4626.989,4658.153,"And I'm really putting a fine point on it really because obviously as green internationally we're nowhere on track right now in fact, things are getting worse on some measures but also with specific reference to Seattle the office of Sustainability staff remember in the 2018 greenhouse gas inventory report which is I believe the most recent report we have.",79,,
498,0.97,4658.153,4664.693,And of course if we have an updated report we should be looking at that.,79,,
499,0.97,4664.693,4671.833,We looked at that report from in your presentation you all did.,79,,
500,0.97,4671.833,4677.739,I know we talked about this in committee and this will be a Recap of that.,79,,
501,0.97,4677.739,4695.29,We had a little discussion on this but especially poignant to me and I will never forget is the graph we looked at where the city started with gas reductions.,79,,
502,0.97,4695.29,4700.495,We looked at the target for greenhouse reductions and what is happening with our region.,79,,
503,0.97,4700.495,4709.905,I think you had already taken charge then so you were called to the foundation and it looked like a cliff.,79,,
504,0.97,4709.905,4712.541,The line of what has happened is basically flat.,79,,
505,0.97,4712.541,4719.481,If we are to meet the targets of 2030 then what we need to achieve goes deeper and deeper.,79,,
506,0.97,4719.481,4736.131,"In fact, in order to catch up from where we haven't gone actually we will need to do much much better and in fact, on some of the Metrics actually things slid back which is extremely worrisome.",79,,
507,0.97,4736.131,4739.568,So you know that's my reference point for all of this.,79,,
508,0.97,4739.568,4749.311,"And then, so most of the questions that my office will have for the rest of the budget process as far as the assistance is concerned.",79,,
509,0.97,4749.311,4766.328,"Sort of from that standpoint and specifically on the Buildingweatherization funds I know you mentioned that most of the, the building funds from the big business staff that was approved last year.",79,,
510,0.97,4766.328,4780.208,"But I was wondering if you could, if now or later given all of you an overview of the green deal program.",79,,
511,0.97,4780.208,4796.925,And how the scale of the existing programs and funding how all of that compares with where Seattle needs to be to be on track to have the Weatherization component to make the city carbon neutral.,79,,
512,0.97,4796.925,4797.526,Thank you.,79,,
513,0.97,4797.526,4799.528,Thank you so much for that.,80,,
514,0.97,4799.528,4811.306,We will be happy to come back and meet with the green deal over sight board and bring a package.,80,,
515,0.97,4811.306,4820.415,When the Mayor's 2022 project was announced we sent a table to the green oversight board to let them know all of the investments that were part of the payroll jump start funds.,80,,
516,0.97,4820.415,4825.086,So they had it all in one place.,80,,
517,0.97,4825.086,4837.065,And I will say that yes the office of housing has the oil heat conversions if that's what you're talking about or Weatherization as a whole.,80,,
518,0.97,4837.065,4856.017,But the funding that OEH will be getting is the funding until the oil heat tax comes into play and when the tax comes into play there's essentially projected budget to try to cover the conversions of the thousand or so homes that we believe fall within the low income range that may have all the heat.,80,,
519,0.97,4856.017,4867.028,Although we don't have all of the specific data that's from the utility discount program data.,80,,
520,0.97,4867.028,4870.065,I want to thank you for all your comments.,80,,
521,0.97,4870.065,4873.835,That was my first week on the job when I came to present on the committee.,80,,
522,0.97,4873.835,4874.703,I remember the tables as well.,80,,
523,0.97,4874.703,4881.576,It was 17 times faster than the current rate of reduction or 23 times faster than the current speed of reduction.,80,,
524,0.97,4881.576,4882.544,So that's where we are.,80,,
525,0.97,4882.544,4887.148,I just want to say that's why I think this is a really exciting time.,80,,
526,0.97,4887.148,4906.468,And you are right to thank all of the community that has been working long and hard for this and for Council and for our team at ose and for our Mayor to be Prioritizing this I think we're really ready to take some bold action to address the climate crisis.,80,,
527,0.97,4906.468,4909.237,Did you have something else you would like to add at this point.,81,,
528,0.97,4909.237,4910.939,"Not at this point, thank you.",82,,
529,0.97,4910.939,4911.239,Thank you.,82,,
530,0.97,4911.239,4912.974,Thank you for getting us started.,83,,
531,0.97,4912.974,4918.246,I'll be happy to answer questions later as well.,84,,
532,0.97,4918.246,4919.648,Wonderful.,85,,
533,0.97,4919.648,4923.351,Council member Morales please go ahead.,85,,
534,0.97,4923.351,4924.286,Thank you.,86,,
535,0.97,4924.286,4938.199,"So, maybe asking the same thing Council member Sawant asked, first I just want to say that I am also very excited about having the green new deal oversight board coming Online.",86,,
536,0.97,4938.199,4953.748,And I think it's going to be a really important opportunity for our community members to start to weigh in and help some of the decision making about what strategies we need to be investing in.,86,,
537,0.97,4953.748,4955.116,So excited to be supporting that work.,86,,
538,0.97,4955.116,4963.291,"I do have, I have a lot of questions about the home heating oil program and maybe some of this we should just talk about Offline.",86,,
539,0.97,4963.291,4976.204,And I do just want to signal a little bit of confusion about the intent maybe.,86,,
540,0.97,4976.204,4988.45,"So, I know that we have you know about 1,000 low income folks who would be eligible for the assistance in making the conversion, if they qualify for the EDP.",86,,
541,0.97,4988.45,5001.93,But my understanding is that the greatest burden is likely to be on people who have a fixed income.,86,,
542,0.97,5001.93,5002.997,I.E.,86,,
543,0.97,5002.997,5004.666,Seniors who may not be low income.,86,,
544,0.97,5004.666,5016.911,I certainly appreciate the goal of trying to assist folks who are on a fixed income or who are low income in making that conversion.,86,,
545,0.97,5016.911,5027.689,"It's the tax itself that's burdensome and Regressive and so, so then I start to ask, okay why are we doing this tax.",86,,
546,0.97,5027.689,5050.311,"If it's to Incentivize people to make the conversion or they will have to pay a tax, the data as I understand it indicate that last year even with the pandemic we had almost 1,300 homes who Decommissioned their rate.",86,,
547,0.97,5050.311,5055.683,The rate of conversion has been consistent.,86,,
548,0.97,5055.683,5066.394,I'm just trying to understand how this is working and what the goal is here.,86,,
549,0.97,5066.394,5071.199,Assuming that the taxes are burdensome for low income folks.,86,,
550,0.97,5071.199,5075.603,And given the fact that folks are converting at a pretty decent rate.,86,,
551,0.97,5075.603,5092.62,I'm wondering if there's a different way for us to provide the support to low income families to make the conversion without having to have a Regressive goal to make though fronts.,86,,
552,0.97,5092.62,5107.936,I'm asking if the rate of conversion has been highly steady will that Procollude us from Proclude us from making a system.,86,,
553,0.97,5107.936,5129.29,"I do want to sort of dive into kind of the nuts and bolts of whether this is achieving the goals we think we could achieve even given the fact we've extended a delay at the state level, you know what had been hoped to be a grant program to provide some assistance has now in fact, become a loan project and creates yet another barrier.",86,,
554,0.97,5129.29,5131.626,"So, if you have some short answers to that, that would be great.",86,,
555,0.97,5131.626,5136.898,But I just want to signal that I would be really interested in learning a little bit more about this.,86,,
556,0.97,5136.898,5148.443,And we're happy to have some conversations with you after this presentation and I Canengage Christine.,87,,
557,0.97,5148.443,5152.213,The tax amounts to about $120 a year.,87,,
558,0.97,5152.213,5171.933,"And I believe as part of the legislation, that Council passed there's a rebate for low income homeowners.",87,,
559,0.97,5171.933,5179.14,There's a rebate that comes for low income homeowners to do the conversion for low income homes.,87,,
560,0.97,5179.14,5193.855,"What we're trying to do is Retrofits in our city that is dirty, that is emitting emissions, that is harming people and finding creative ways to do that and to raise the revenue.",87,,
561,0.97,5193.855,5202.43,Part of this tax is paying for that and signaling Thats that something this city is hoping to eliminate by 2030.,87,,
562,0.97,5202.43,5220.215,"I would also say that, you know we're actively pursuing other funding as well to try to do, we know as you mentioned as you start as you rely on the thing itself to provide the revenue at some point you will not have the revenue.",87,,
563,0.97,5220.215,5227.655,"As part of our incentive approach with rebate as well, making sure when people aren't switching off oil and heat making sure they're not going to natural gas.",87,,
564,0.97,5227.655,5235.597,And we really want to Prioritize them going to clean electric heat pumps which provide a lot of energy.,87,,
565,0.97,5235.597,5247.709,Our incentives that we're offering to middle and higher income families is also helping to make sure that we're actually achieving the climate goals we have.,87,,
566,0.97,5247.709,5250.445,I think there's a lot to talk about.,87,,
567,0.97,5250.445,5262.056,"I think it's been a really, I think we should not in this hearing right now talk about like the tax itself and moving forward with the tax and answer some of your questions there.",87,,
568,0.97,5262.056,5278.673,It has been designed to Incentivize electric heat pumps to pay for low income families that may not be able to afford to pay the full conversion even to natural gas.,87,,
569,0.97,5278.673,5283.544,Thank you for the question.,87,,
570,0.97,5283.544,5285.046,Thank you very much.,88,,
571,0.97,5285.046,5286.948,Council member Herbold go ahead.,88,,
572,0.97,5286.948,5300.295,"I'm going to return to, a line of questioning that I had this morning that director noble may have mentioned.",89,,
573,0.97,5300.295,5305.767,"One of his slides made the impression that the group was getting the full $500,000.",89,,
574,0.97,5305.767,5308.169,And I don't think that's the case.,89,,
575,0.97,5308.169,5309.437,It would be great.,89,,
576,0.97,5309.437,5312.507,But that's not the case.,89,,
577,0.97,5312.507,5315.476,"I know they were recruiting $112,000 from the human services Department.",89,,
578,0.97,5315.476,5322.55,They were directed to apply for some funding in your Department.,89,,
579,0.97,5322.55,5338.766,I'm just trying to get bottom line now that they asked me to apply for that grant because it's going to be direct funding from ose to the youth core.,89,,
580,0.97,5338.766,5341.736,However we're looking at for them in 2022.,89,,
581,0.97,5341.736,5348.943,Seeping to give that information in that slide in Dr. noble's presentation.,89,,
582,0.97,5348.943,5352.58,"I don't want there to be hopes, confusion right.",89,,
583,0.97,5352.58,5355.149,We don't want to be confused.,89,,
584,0.97,5355.149,5355.917,That's the word.,90,,
585,0.97,5355.917,5363.224,"And I will, I'll answer, I don't want to, are you finished with that line of your questions.",91,,
586,0.97,5363.224,5372.834,"So I want to and I'm sure Alberto will have more specifics that he can share but what I want to say is you're correct that this funding this $500,000 is amazing.",91,,
587,0.97,5372.834,5386.347,It's a substantial amount of funding is designed to support youth leadership development collectively in the Dawamish valley.,91,,
588,0.97,5386.347,5391.219,Alberto just let me know there's a new coalition that we want to look at the too.,91,,
589,0.97,5391.219,5396.958,I can't speak to the Hs human services division funding that you Referenced to before.,91,,
590,0.97,5396.958,5404.665,But I can say that ose is also part of our standard operating budget.,91,,
591,0.97,5404.665,5406.834,We have always funded the youth core.,91,,
592,0.97,5406.834,5408.77,We've done really exciting projects with them.,91,,
593,0.97,5408.77,5412.106,We've had them correct with our urban forestry Commission.,91,,
594,0.97,5412.106,5424.719,We've had them learn from our urban forest or from Sdot or Dilly from our Seattle trees program.,91,,
595,0.97,5424.719,5425.987,To identify locations where trees can go.,91,,
596,0.97,5425.987,5434.896,To care for trees so they've been very engaged in lots of environmental and climate work we've been doing.,91,,
597,0.97,5434.896,5437.832,And so we've always funded them.,91,,
598,0.97,5437.832,5440.368,As long as I can remember.,91,,
599,0.97,5440.368,5446.04,I can't say specifically about they were directed to apply for funding to ose.,91,,
600,0.97,5446.04,5449.177,I think Alberto can talk to that.,91,,
601,0.97,5449.177,5452.947,But at some point there was a situation and they are talking about funding.,91,,
602,0.97,5452.947,5460.655,"And our staff identified, here are the resources available that you could apply to that can kind of support the work you do.",91,,
603,0.97,5460.655,5461.589,I will say right now.,91,,
604,0.97,5461.589,5467.261,I don't on my mind have a specific amount that goes to each organization.,91,,
605,0.97,5467.261,5473.367,This is something we want to work on look at the organizations and what's their current capacity and plan.,91,,
606,0.97,5473.367,5480.107,How to we look at supporting youth leadership environment in a comprehensive way.,91,,
607,0.97,5480.107,5480.508,In the valley.,91,,
608,0.97,5480.508,5485.78,"What we're trying to solve is they lost $112,000 in funding.",92,,
609,0.97,5485.78,5486.414,Got it.,93,,
610,0.97,5486.414,5501.462,And if that were turning away from Hsd to ose I just want to get a sense of how much they can expect to be funded in 2022 to make up for that huge loss from the Hsd funding.,94,,
611,0.97,5501.462,5502.43,"Okay, thank you understand.",95,,
612,0.97,5502.43,5507.034,Alberto is there anything more you would like to add to my response?,95,,
613,0.97,5507.034,5514.408,There's just a couple of fine point and thank you for that question Council member Herbold.,96,,
614,0.97,5514.408,5516.01,The way Michelle mentioned I'm just going to echo that.,96,,
615,0.97,5516.01,5520.014,I don't think I have a specific number.,96,,
616,0.97,5520.014,5530.892,There's a very new news and the budget has not been approved by Council yet so I will add the final number to that report.,96,,
617,0.97,5530.892,5540.167,But our mission is to meet the needs that in that funding gap they've had since they're not going to be funded by Hsp.,96,,
618,0.97,5540.167,5545.139,If they're still in need of that amount they can certainly meet it.,96,,
619,0.97,5545.139,5554.682,The Mayor's budget is committed to fill that gap completely and actually the vision is to expand if there's an interest and if there's capacity in terms of number of youth.,96,,
620,0.97,5554.682,5561.155,"You know this, that even though they have maybe like 40 spots for Cohert.",96,,
621,0.97,5561.155,5562.156,"Sixty, 70 kids show up.",96,,
622,0.97,5562.156,5567.428,They want us to engage because everyone if they don't get paid.,96,,
623,0.97,5567.428,5573.334,"You know the vision that we have, hopefully you know Council will approve the budget is to meet the need.",96,,
624,0.97,5573.334,5584.312,To expand the program not only in terms of the number but some indications that they had in terms of not being able to provide Stipends for second year youth.,96,,
625,0.97,5584.312,5589.65,That's one of the considerations that we have.,96,,
626,0.97,5589.65,5598.326,"And also, if they can expand and if they have the capacity to expand by number what is the need they have to expand their staff capacity.",96,,
627,0.97,5598.326,5608.903,"So these are conversations that we will be, this is the proposal and the details that we will be Codeveloping with our community partner such as the development youth core.",96,,
628,0.97,5608.903,5612.64,If and when the budget is approved by Council.,96,,
629,0.97,5612.64,5636.697,And just like Michelle mentioned there are other groups efforts in the George Georgetown side of things.,96,,
630,0.97,5636.697,5650.111,Andthe other thing we're trying to expand is that tied to what's next after these kids cannot participate in some of these youth programs.,96,,
631,0.97,5650.111,5652.213,That type of youth force to career.,96,,
632,0.97,5652.213,5656.217,Can we help them connect them to career support.,96,,
633,0.97,5656.217,5661.889,"For higher education, for other kinds of jobs.",96,,
634,0.97,5661.889,5662.623,Blue collar jobs.,96,,
635,0.97,5662.623,5668.396,We're very flexible and our short answer is we're hoping to meet the need.,96,,
636,0.97,5668.396,5679.907,"Grow that pot of funding and support other efforts that will actually make this more, a comprehensive sweep of benefits to our youth.",96,,
637,0.97,5679.907,5683.044,Another really quick question.,97,,
638,0.97,5683.044,5692.987,"In the table I'm just curious as to why, things like item two, this relief.",97,,
639,0.97,5692.987,5699.66,Item four the work force development and item nine which another work force development item.,97,,
640,0.97,5699.66,5708.803,"Why we're seeing these in ose and not in, office city development.",97,,
641,0.97,5708.803,5711.639,These seem to be economic development investment related.,97,,
642,0.97,5711.639,5719.013,"Another question I had asked earlier this morning, would just love to know a little bit.",97,,
643,0.97,5719.013,5724.151,It's not developed yesterday because it's a concept without implementation yet.,97,,
644,0.97,5724.151,5732.693,Know a little bit more about how the rebates for electric vehicles work.,97,,
645,0.97,5732.693,5746.073,"How we're going to make sure that they're going to vehicles traveling through neighborhoods, gas diesel vehicles are having huge impacts on residential neighborhoods.",97,,
646,0.97,5746.073,5748.242,Those are great great questions.,98,,
647,0.97,5748.242,5749.61,Thank you for asking them.,98,,
648,0.97,5749.61,5751.078,"Yeah, I was listening to the conversation.",98,,
649,0.97,5751.078,5757.551,It was nice to follow up the economic development.,98,,
650,0.97,5757.551,5765.726,We're so excited to have the green new deal oversight board up and running with the kind of work force and labor expertise that's on this board.,98,,
651,0.97,5765.726,5773.734,We know the green new deal itself is kind of a work force and labor transition initiative.,98,,
652,0.97,5773.734,5789.183,And so where we see ose connecting with Oed and other city departments is how are we making those connections to have focused work force and job training and career opportunities in the clean energy sector.,98,,
653,0.97,5789.183,5794.755,So it's a very specific sector focused on the kinds of jobs that we want to see in the future.,98,,
654,0.97,5794.755,5802.763,And I think some of why you're seeing this in the ose budget right now is that we have very strong partnerships that we have been doing.,98,,
655,0.97,5802.763,5816.377,One through the green new oversight board and all of the stake holders two through the work that Alberto and other colleagues have been doing in the valley which are connected to the industrial and manufacturing industry.,98,,
656,0.97,5816.377,5829.456,And so we're really looking to jump start some of this work to get this going on what some of these green careers.,98,,
657,0.97,5829.456,5834.094,"I don't think ose is going to become the work force, the green work force Organization for Seattle.",98,,
658,0.97,5834.094,5843.404,We want a partner and we really want to think about as we look ahead to the over all strategy that we heard Congress Membermorales had.,98,,
659,0.97,5843.404,5847.474,How does the green new deal fit into the broader tragedy of work force.,98,,
660,0.97,5847.474,5863.29,"We see Ourselfs in that piece and I will also say that, with the green new deal city team that we have up and running now, there will be a work force sub committee that brings together all the key departments who are thinking about clean energy work force development.",98,,
661,0.97,5863.29,5877.538,"Sos that going to be like the first place where we're going to go, so that is going to be the first place where we go for the initiative.",98,,
662,0.97,5877.538,5881.275,And look at the long term structure for how we really move this work.,98,,
663,0.97,5881.275,5898.158,"I will also mention that we have through our work, through like the buildings work that we've been doing and through the municipal energy initiative work that we work with capital apartments on.",98,,
664,0.97,5898.158,5903.397,We've been working with Seattle college and they have a building technology program.,98,,
665,0.97,5903.397,5920.914,We have for the last three years students that are part of that program who are actually going out and doing assessments in buildings who are actually learning how do our mandates work and how do we actually work with these businesses in achieving the board.,98,,
666,0.97,5920.914,5930.891,This is all about job training and preparing for these jobs we're seeing are only going to grow when we see more and more standards.,98,,
667,0.97,5930.891,5946.473,"More and more mandates for retrofitting fossil fuels, natural gas and official buildings green buildings.",98,,
668,0.97,5946.473,5947.841,That is the connection that ose has.,98,,
669,0.97,5947.841,5957.451,I don't have the answers of where we'll be three years from that but we're really excited to get going on these efforts.,98,,
670,0.97,5957.451,5961.789,"The other question, what was if other question, the incentive program.",98,,
671,0.97,5961.789,5964.658,I will say it's not figured out yet at all.,98,,
672,0.97,5964.658,5974.001,And I just attended this morning I'm down in the office like for the third time in two years.,98,,
673,0.97,5974.001,5981.809,"I just attended a meeting with clean transportation and who, Alberto was on this meeting as well.",98,,
674,0.97,5981.809,6022.282,They're attending some work we're doing and I talked to you about a zero emission zone in the valley and looking at these heavy duty vehicles to be a Lighthouse in this area and be kind of like an inspiration to other cities and other places to really look at with the new technologies coming with these heavy duty vehicles making sure that not just the biggest fleets like the amazons and you know the big fleets are taking advantage of new technology and buying it up because they have the resources.,98,,
675,0.97,6022.282,6028.222,Our goal is to make sure those small and independent operators that need the assistance.,98,,
676,0.97,6028.222,6034.228,It's akin to people in their homes who don't have the money to change out their Oil-Heating system.,98,,
677,0.97,6034.228,6037.498,How are we helping people struggling to be part of the transition to clean energy.,98,,
678,0.97,6037.498,6047.841,I want to say that as part of the work we're doing with the International Council on clean transportation we're actually doing surveys of truck operators and understanding where do you live.,98,,
679,0.97,6047.841,6049.91,Where do you come from.,98,,
680,0.97,6049.91,6051.612,Where do you park.,98,,
681,0.97,6051.612,6060.387,"Are you, so we're actually going to have very good information about those operators and be able to target those operators that one might be parking.",98,,
682,0.97,6060.387,6065.359,We've heard a lot about the parking issues right.,98,,
683,0.97,6065.359,6072.266,And our driving in and through that community.,98,,
684,0.97,6072.266,6080.974,So we're really connecting it to the diesel related.,98,,
685,0.97,6080.974,6086.68,Thank you.,99,,
686,0.97,6086.68,6092.853,We're really looking at the green project in the valley zone.,99,,
687,0.97,6092.853,6098.826,"I walked out of that meeting, it was the first time I had been in a meeting with five people in one room.",100,,
688,0.97,6098.826,6101.495,We had masks on but it was really exciting.,100,,
689,0.97,6101.495,6104.998,The work is exciting but being with people is exciting too.,100,,
690,0.97,6104.998,6105.466,"So, thank you.",100,,
691,0.97,6105.466,6108.068,Thank you so much.,101,,
692,0.97,6108.068,6115.609,I am not seeing any additional hands so I'm going to ask a few quick questions to round this out unless there's another hand thank you.,101,,
693,0.97,6115.609,6120.113,I'm going to wait Council member Pederson I see your hand please go ahead.,101,,
694,0.97,6120.113,6141.535,Thank you chairman Mosqueda and thank you director Caulfield to you and your team especially for the work you've done during the pandemic to expanding the green bucks program and all the things we all had to do.,102,,
695,0.97,6141.535,6153.38,"One of the things, want to Piggy back on what Council member Sawant had.",102,,
696,0.97,6153.38,6164.791,"Just wanted to know, this is something we can talk about later and I know city budget office is sort of a lead on that but at the same time I didn't know if you, we're getting questions from departments.",102,,
697,0.97,6164.791,6173.033,How is that going over all with departments answering those two questions emissions and adaptation.,102,,
698,0.97,6173.033,6179.64,"Regarding adaptation, I know we've had a lot of good questions about controlling emissions.",102,,
699,0.97,6179.64,6187.214,"I know there was a 2017 report on climate adaptation, preparing for climate change that we're doing.",102,,
700,0.97,6187.214,6193.921,I'm wondering if that's something that has to be adapted.,102,,
701,0.97,6193.921,6199.826,I am looking at it with a lens of what does the Department of transportation has to do because we're already in it.,102,,
702,0.97,6199.826,6223.483,"Just wanted to put out there that there are some groups who are really interested in phasing out gas powered leaf Blowers and I know that, that's it's not clear which Department would work on something like that but that's something that I might ask the executive to look at is how can we do that in an equitable way to phase things out over time.",102,,
703,0.97,6223.483,6231.258,Both with the city government and everyone externally in the private market.,102,,
704,0.97,6231.258,6258.018,"The other thing we're dealing with is Council member Strauss leadership is trying to work to get a tree protection Ordnance so their different, there was a slide or statement of legislative intend approved by the Council last year to see if there are different ways to manage tree, tree canopy in the city because there were ten departments that were involved.",102,,
705,0.97,6258.018,6268.829,I know there are a lot of people advocating for trees are interested in increasing the role of your office because of your focus on the environment.,102,,
706,0.97,6268.829,6271.064,So just signaling that there will be something.,102,,
707,0.97,6271.064,6273.4,We did get a response about that.,102,,
708,0.97,6273.4,6278.005,It was really just saying we the executive need more information before we can answer a question.,102,,
709,0.97,6278.005,6282.843,"So it wasn't, I was not, I was not excited about that response.",102,,
710,0.97,6282.843,6301.928,So I think might want to look in this budget about doing something more Proactive about trees Maybe I heard of an idea of a position of chief Arborist or somebody who has to sign off on removal of exceptional trees for example.,102,,
711,0.97,6301.928,6314.908,"But circling back to adaptation and the, the departments having to speak to whether legislation is reducing emissions or enact to climate change.",102,,
712,0.97,6314.908,6322.215,"Is there anything, or this is something we should be waiting for the green climate deal economy to propose.",102,,
713,0.97,6322.215,6327.721,Thank you for your questions.,103,,
714,0.97,6327.721,6329.022,I hope I can answer.,103,,
715,0.97,6329.022,6332.025,I think I heard three of four of them.,103,,
716,0.97,6332.025,6332.726,I had a climate note.,103,,
717,0.97,6332.726,6348.208,Yes I did check in when I first started my position as the interim just for this year.,103,,
718,0.97,6348.208,6352.179,I checked in with Cdo.,103,,
719,0.97,6352.179,6370.931,We're at a point where a lot of different departments and staff across departments see climate change and climate adaptation as part of their normal business.,103,,
720,0.97,6370.931,6396.156,Like what they need to do and how does that impact our service delivery.,103,,
721,0.97,6396.156,6398.759,There's a lot of good information on capital investments.,103,,
722,0.97,6398.759,6403.864,I think I will say we've been working on the adaptation more generally.,103,,
723,0.97,6403.864,6406.433,For example the heat Island research we did in 2020.,103,,
724,0.97,6406.433,6412.706,We really wanted to understand across the city what are the areas across the city that's experiencing more extreme heat.,103,,
725,0.97,6412.706,6420.247,And how do we want to help communities before more Adaptive and resilient to that.,103,,
726,0.97,6420.247,6427.554,It isn't a body of work that the city is working on adaptation but it's something we've been talking to other departments about.,103,,
727,0.97,6427.554,6449.476,"And I guess I will just give you a little bit of, just let you know that there's an active group that meets Phoápbtsly called the adaptation group and it's eight different departments that come together that collectively going after funding to help us be more resilient and to adapt to climate changes.",103,,
728,0.97,6449.476,6467.828,I think maybe we can follow up with Council members that are interested in understanding a little bit more about how we are preparing and I want to shine a spotlight on Alberto for a moment too because he's been doing some really exciting work in the Dwamish valley.,103,,
729,0.97,6467.828,6475.068,And some of our properties and areas are the most vulnerable to flooding and heat.,103,,
730,0.97,6475.068,6481.708,"And so, we got a grant from the Robert wood Johnson foundation last year.",103,,
731,0.97,6481.708,6486.313,"It's a $650,000 grant to creating a district for the valley.",103,,
732,0.97,6486.313,6497.424,That's a resilient focus to some of those physical changes that we know are happening and also how can community be more resilient and adapt and as we make improvements so that places aren't flooded out.,103,,
733,0.97,6497.424,6502.262,How do we also keep people in place.,103,,
734,0.97,6502.262,6512.172,So it's a very comprehensive resilient study that I can be a model to other neighborhoods in our city as well.,103,,
735,0.97,6512.172,6513.173,And for our trees.,103,,
736,0.97,6513.173,6523.25,I know our team works we have a forestry advisor Sandra pinto has retired but we have an out of class in that position right now continuing that important coordination work.,103,,
737,0.97,6523.25,6528.088,I know they looked at what they could do with the information they had in the expertise they had.,103,,
738,0.97,6528.088,6529.589,And that as far as they could with that.,103,,
739,0.97,6529.589,6537.163,So we will be on the watch for anything more that comes from you on that.,103,,
740,0.97,6537.163,6545.538,I agree ose holds the office of Sustainability environment holds a very important climate and environmental value for our city over all.,103,,
741,0.97,6545.538,6560.387,"I do want to say, some of the ideas around us becoming tree regulators and taking on a whole regulatory land use body is something that is a channel for an office like ours a 30 person office.",103,,
742,0.97,6560.387,6564.357,So I think it's not an easy yes you should just do that.,103,,
743,0.97,6564.357,6587.147,I think we've been a really great partner and have worked very closely with Sbi with some of the inclusive outreach on some of the meetings that are happening internally to look at some of the true protection opportunities to expand tree protection.,103,,
744,0.97,6587.147,6591.451,We've definitely been definitely been there as a partner.,103,,
745,0.97,6591.451,6599.326,I appreciate your confidence in us our the communities confidence in that and our incentive to make sure that we protect our trees as we grow.,103,,
746,0.97,6599.326,6601.261,Did I hit everything you asked.,103,,
747,0.97,6601.261,6602.729,I may have missed one thing.,103,,
748,0.97,6602.729,6604.23,Yes you did.,104,,
749,0.97,6604.23,6607.367,I talked about gas powered leaf Blowers but that's something.,104,,
750,0.97,6607.367,6609.002,Seattle parks Department.,105,,
751,0.97,6609.002,6610.136,That's something for later.,106,,
752,0.97,6610.136,6611.938,That we can sort out later.,106,,
753,0.97,6611.938,6612.238,Thank you.,106,,
754,0.97,6612.238,6616.643,Thank you for the questions.,107,,
755,0.97,6616.643,6620.113,Thank you very much Council member Pedersen.,108,,
756,0.97,6620.113,6628.588,Colleagues we have a few more minutes on this topic and I'm going to ask a few questions then we will transition to our last hour and our last item.,108,,
757,0.97,6628.588,6630.991,If we can have slide number one placed up there.,108,,
758,0.97,6630.991,6635.862,I'm going to ask a few questions on slide number one and number two.,108,,
759,0.97,6635.862,6640.967,And if it's helpful for you I'm happy to drop those in the chat.,108,,
760,0.97,6640.967,6646.006,So to read them out loud as well for our viewing audience.,108,,
761,0.97,6646.006,6648.074,So on slide number one.,108,,
762,0.97,6648.074,6662.489,Can you summarize for us what the total jump start funding amount is that is going in to the that is going into ose for 2022.,108,,
763,0.97,6662.489,6668.461,How does that correspond with the reduction in general fund dollars going into the Department.,108,,
764,0.97,6668.461,6669.162,And then if you Toggle.,108,,
765,0.97,6669.162,6670.597,I can hold if you would like.,108,,
766,0.97,6670.597,6685.412,I think I can but we Jeanie will help us do that.,109,,
767,0.97,6685.412,6687.747,Welcome Jeanie.,109,,
768,0.97,6687.747,6689.049,Hello.,110,,
769,0.97,6689.049,6701.528,I think Yeah down there there's a note that the other procreation category is where you're seeing the jump start payroll tax added.,110,,
770,0.97,6701.528,6702.195,That's 2.75 million.,110,,
771,0.97,6702.195,6715.041,Being added to what we already had in our baseline of 5.9 million for the sugar and beverage tax.,110,,
772,0.97,6715.041,6727.587,That's the appropriation where the other category comes Fromment and those were the items if you look at the tables that a specific data table that give you the detail that were all marked as payroll tax.,110,,
773,0.97,6727.587,6729.355,They should add up to the 2.75.,110,,
774,0.97,6729.355,6732.792,Then what was your other part of your question on that?,110,,
775,0.97,6732.792,6739.499,I think you answered how does that correspond with the reduction in the general fund dollars going to ose.,111,,
776,0.97,6739.499,6751.077,The general fund reduction is sort of a combination of a ton of things but in our adopted budget we had some money added for the emergency grocery vouchers.,112,,
777,0.97,6751.077,6754.981,So that was backed out of our budget.,112,,
778,0.97,6754.981,6773.6,Because that program ended so and then we had then in the detailed tables anything that was marked as general fund new adds total 1.75 million so those together kind of end up with the 1.4 reduction.,112,,
779,0.97,6773.6,6774.601,Just to clarify.,113,,
780,0.97,6774.601,6786.88,"When we did this, the general fund reductions and the allocation of the payroll tax, we weren't adding the payroll tax to make up for the reduction.",113,,
781,0.97,6786.88,6795.088,They were sub different reasons on why the general fund resources describe some of the more intended to be that one time.,113,,
782,0.97,6795.088,6799.125,Just it's intended as an addition related to green new deal.,113,,
783,0.97,6799.125,6803.296,The separate consideration of some of the other previous fund reports.,113,,
784,0.97,6803.296,6805.532,Just to under score what you're saying Ben.,114,,
785,0.97,6805.532,6816.843,The payroll tax of 2.75 and other appropriation as opposed to general fund which is above.,114,,
786,0.97,6816.843,6822.916,I just want to so it is separate right?,114,,
787,0.97,6822.916,6825.318,Yeah that's correct.,115,,
788,0.97,6825.318,6826.119,"Okay, great.",116,,
789,0.97,6826.119,6841.801,And I'm going to read these next three questions that I have for you Outloud for the viewing public just to make sure everybody foes the questions that I'm interested in.,117,,
790,0.97,6841.801,6852.946,"On slide number two, the proposed budget includes 14.3 million in dedicated green new deal funding consistent with with the city council's jump start priority including Opcd, and office of housing.",117,,
791,0.97,6852.946,6863.122,What are the green new Dealitems proposed in Opcd and Oh.,117,,
792,0.97,6863.122,6876.736,Six P-Pbtd 5 billion also budgeted in finance general as a set aside for priorities that will be identified by the green new deal oversight board and the city wide green new deal interdepartmental team.,117,,
793,0.97,6876.736,6885.578,What is the proposed process and time line for identifying and funding priorities and why the involvement.,117,,
794,0.97,6885.578,6898.658,"And finally, of the total green new deal investments to what portion of those Torbgs what portion of those are existing programs and what are the added to programs, thank you.",117,,
795,0.97,6898.658,6900.96,Great.,118,,
796,0.97,6900.96,6902.095,Thank you so much for those questions.,118,,
797,0.97,6902.095,6912.505,I will take a stab at it and Ben you can correct me or add if you would like to.,118,,
798,0.97,6912.505,6921.047,"I'm, I'll start with the table so the 14.3 the Finance general that's totally new and not additive.",118,,
799,0.97,6921.047,6931.257,The funding that's in the office of funding and community development I believe that's $2.3 million and that is not an ongoing program.,118,,
800,0.97,6931.257,6951.844,But designed to be investments in community facilities to Electrify current fossil natural gas systems or other systems and providing cooling and you know clean air during Mayor heat events so really looking to the concept of community resilience hubs.,118,,
801,0.97,6951.844,6955.114,The Oil-Heat conversion money that's the 1.7 it is an existing program.,118,,
802,0.97,6955.114,6968.928,It is filling a gap of money that doesn't exist so I'm not sure in terms of like it's an existing program but we're trying to make sure we hit our targets with that program.,118,,
803,0.97,6968.928,6973.633,The clean energy Preapprenticeship funds of $1 million completely new and different.,118,,
804,0.97,6973.633,6985.645,This didn't exist before and was actually informed by some research and some conversations we've been having with key partners.,118,,
805,0.97,6985.645,6992.151,The environmental justice funds increase it's an existing fund that we have to give grants to community.,118,,
806,0.97,6992.151,6998.358,Ben you may have to answer the question about.,118,,
807,0.97,6998.358,7010.636,I think none of the 14.3 million is a Subplanting of any existing funding.,119,,
808,0.97,7010.636,7015.308,Some are old program and some are to fund new programs.,119,,
809,0.97,7015.308,7020.146,It's all new investments of one form or another.,119,,
810,0.97,7020.146,7021.247,"Some ongoing, many one time.",119,,
811,0.97,7021.247,7026.185,So that's why Ben noble is the budget director and I'm not.,120,,
812,0.97,7026.185,7031.224,Because he can just answer the question like that.,120,,
813,0.97,7031.224,7032.392,"Thank you, Ben.",120,,
814,0.97,7032.392,7043.136,I think the other question is what is the process or program designed for making those recommendations of the $6.5 million an why is the green new deal Idt part of that.,120,,
815,0.97,7043.136,7045.805,I think that one we want these funds.,120,,
816,0.97,7045.805,7048.641,It was really important.,120,,
817,0.97,7048.641,7055.548,It is super important and actually Ben I met with the green new deal board to do the budget 101.,120,,
818,0.97,7055.548,7060.019,To walk them and help them understand the budget.,120,,
819,0.97,7060.019,7064.157,And the budget of making these recommendations on the money.,120,,
820,0.97,7064.157,7084.01,In terms of the green new deal and the future 2023 budget that's really going to be up to them in terms of their time line and preparations about how quickly they want to move to make recommendations to get money out the door to how much they want to engage with broader community and take their time and be intentional.,120,,
821,0.97,7084.01,7086.612,We want both of those things to happen.,120,,
822,0.97,7086.612,7093.82,We think there will be a balance they'll think about as a board as they're getting up and running and map out their own time line.,120,,
823,0.97,7093.82,7097.29,Their first public meeting is tomorrow at 5:00 P.M.,120,,
824,0.97,7097.29,7106.065,I know they'll be adopting a time line of action at that meeting.,120,,
825,0.97,7106.065,7111.204,They will be making those decisions around that.,120,,
826,0.97,7111.204,7119.011,An important group of leaders to partner with the green new deal [Captioner transition],120,,
827,0.97,7133.426,7160.419,"There is a budget and I did not add in the highlighted, somebody to help facilitate relationship building between city staff and the green new deal oversight board so I cannot answer your question now to map out what with the process exactly look like.",121,,

841,0.97,7348.007,7350.91,Next slide please.,126,,
842,0.97,7350.91,7358.217,This table is a summary of deals proposed budget for 2022.,126,,
843,0.97,7358.217,7368.627,Our proposed budget is 123 million which is 19 million more than the 2021 adopted budget.,126,,
844,0.97,7368.627,7378.137,Of the proposed amount 16 million is funded by the general Fund and the balance is funded mostly by the levy.,126,,
845,0.97,7378.137,7383.709,Next slide please.,126,,
846,0.97,7383.709,7410.169,So now I'm going to highlight the key changes in our budget and as you know we literally just announced enrollment in the program is more than 1000 Seattle students and so the 2022 budget or proposed budget includes 6.7 million in Federal funds for the Seattle promise through 2023.,126,,
847,0.97,7410.169,7423.149,The funding will support programming to alleviate impacts on students during Covid and really make program improvements as recommended by the Seattle promise race and equity Toolkit.,126,,
848,0.97,7423.149,7447.606,"Our new funding and partnerships will address educational equity toward three program outcomes and they are student preparation for College-Level Coursework, retention in college and then the completion of a certificate, credential, a degree or transferring to a four-year institution.",126,,
849,0.97,7447.606,7467.626,Now I will take a quick moment to highlight a few enhancements funded by the resources which are really versus will support the increase of equity scholarship for more or should I say from $500 a quarter to $1000 a quarter.,126,,
850,0.97,7467.626,7489.648,"The eligibility will expand, currently only the students with zero or excuse me expected family competition are eligible so this would allow students with up to $1000 expected family contribution to be eligible for the equity scholarship.",126,,
851,0.97,7489.648,7503.629,They will also cover the cost of mandatory and general enrollment fees for certain eligible students and provide students up to three additional quarters to complete their program or degree.,126,,
852,0.97,7503.629,7516.575,"It will also allow students in the 2019 and 2020 cohorts who lost eligibility, it will allow them to have up to three additional quarters of promise support.",126,,
853,0.97,7516.575,7557.483,"Super excited about that, the budget also includes what you were mentioning the 2.4 million for Childcare Stabilization and as you know Deel implemented the first round of Childcare stabilization grants in the first quarter of 2021, we awarded 436 grants to licensed Childcare providers and we Prioritized those that serve children on subsidies and those located in our geographic, the priority geographic areas and the grant amounts range from five to $10,000 with the average 6500.",126,,
854,0.97,7557.483,7566.592,I'm sure you know we are super excited to distribute more of the funds in 2022 to the industry hit hard by the pandemic.,126,,
855,0.97,7566.592,7573.132,"We know how critical it is, the recovery of our city's economy.",126,,
856,0.97,7573.132,7612.171,"Super excited about that, as I mentioned the economic hardship that the Childcare providers and employees experience due to the loss of either income, layoffs and really reduced work hours because of Covid that we are experiencing . The two populations eligible for this assistance, the first will be the licensed Childcare providers both centers and the family child care homes in the second would be the family friend and neighborhood providers.",126,,
857,0.97,7612.171,7629.588,So from there what I want to share now is the equitable communities initiative and this investment will allow us to expand and enhance on the work that we already do particularly with these communities.,126,,
858,0.97,7629.588,7651.176,"The fund is designed to benefit youth who are impacted by systemic inequities and education, some of the activities supported by this fund will be youth leadership and cultural expectation, family support and engagement and education diversity in professional development.",126,,
859,0.97,7651.176,7670.596,Or should I say professional and organizational development so those activities will be supported by these funds and the focus is that we work directly with our CBO's rather than just the SPs and schools.,126,,
860,0.97,7670.596,7710.169,I'm sure you know one part of the work that I am excited about is really a new set of Ctivities focusing family support and engagement that will help bridge communities of color in schools and help them navigate educational system that is super complicated and not designed for students and people of color but the work will be conducted in collaboration with our Seattle office of arts and culture and we will establish an equity and cultural education Fund.,126,,
861,0.97,7710.169,7729.888,"So again that funding is a continuation of the support that was added in 2021 and we are looking at a Rfi to come out in late quarter two, excuse me quarter one in 2022.",126,,
862,0.97,7729.888,7736.595,The next is just some support or staff to support all of this amazing work in the expansion of these programs.,126,,
863,0.97,7736.595,7750.309,"My budget will include two new positions, senior Finance analyst to provide fiscal management and a data analyst to support our data and evaluation needs.",126,,
864,0.97,7750.309,7754.213,Next slide please.,126,,
865,0.97,7754.213,7757.116,Thank you.,126,,
866,0.97,7757.116,7785.944,"Okay so now what you see here is, this is a community led recommendation that gives 1.5 million in funding to support the prenatal to three grant program and is recommended by the sweetened beverage tax community advisory board and this program provides funding to Community-Based organizations that specialize in high-quality prenatal to three and kindergarten readiness services.",126,,
867,0.97,7785.944,7813.038,These priorities will be given or is given to organizations that offer the culturally and linguistically relevant services and outreach as well as those that are led by people of color and serving communities of color or low income communities and Rfi for 2021 now is currently open for these funds.,126,,
868,0.97,7813.038,7847.973,"Guidance, you know the guidance or should I say the guiding outcome of this investment is just a support kindergarten readiness and to reduce the disparities and outcomes for young children and families based on race, gender or other social economic factors . The program is really intended to accomplish by doing this by supporting communities and really inform proposals addressing obstacles that contribute to the disparities.",126,,
869,0.97,7847.973,7866.725,"Again it will include just providing families access to critical resources and services but also support healthy and equitable births, increase parental and health and Well- being . It will strengthen the Nurturing and responsive Caregiving on child relationships.",126,,
870,0.97,7866.725,7876.201,"We know how important those are and finally it will support the finest child health, child and health development.",126,,
871,0.97,7876.201,7898.924,"So, what you see right here is birth to 12 labor and Parent- child plus a shift, this change just continues the general fund swap for one more year using the family and education levy fund balance.",126,,
872,0.97,7898.924,7903.662,Next slide please.,126,,
873,0.97,7903.662,7917.276,Okay so as you know our Day-To- day or the Deel day-to-day work and mission is grounded in racial equity by closing opportunity gaps and students.,126,,
874,0.97,7917.276,7928.086,I think you will know this but the first priority of the 2022 budget is to continue to deliver on the great work consistent with investments and evaluation plans.,126,,
875,0.97,7928.086,7946.471,"While I already highlighted the budget priorities, what you see right here listed on the screen and I wanted to reiterate they further educational equity for Seattle kids and families.",126,,
876,0.97,7946.471,7956.181,Also I want to highlight how to propose budget focuses on racial equity internally within Deel.,126,,
877,0.97,7956.181,7965.39,"I am super proud, I know you know this of our Department as we strive to make Deel a place inclusive for all team members.",126,,

879,0.97,7967.926,7997.956,Our focus 2022 and beyond is and I think I mentioned before is attracting and retaining highly engaged and diverse staff and I know we are doing that right now through intentional outreach and promotional hiring opportunities and cultivating a positive culture that we have and we are also doing it through professional development and training commitment.,126,,
880,0.97,7997.956,8024.683,"For 2022 I wanted to share with you the change team helped support the development of a Deel set of policies and processes that will help us create a consistent, equitable and robust system of staff learning opportunities across Deel and all divisions and program levels really to support the mission vision.",126,,
881,0.97,8024.683,8035.093,"So what we have done is I located about $100,000 of the 2022 budget to support professional development and training opportunities, Department wide.",126,,
882,0.97,8035.093,8079.304,Super excited about that and wanted to share in closing at the end of the 2022 budget and just Recapping what I just mentioned that budget and priorities continue to elevate the great work that has been happening over the past few years and looking to enhance those efforts to improve educational equity for those students and families and folks for justice and I want to take a moment to thank all of the Deel team and staff for furthering this great work and I want to thank you all Council not just for your support but for being a champion of this work as well.,126,,

887,0.97,8098.523,8109.668,I am really excited to see the ongoing investment in a lot of the different areas here particularly the Childcare stabilization in early childhood years.,128,,
888,0.97,8109.668,8116.241,That's where we have the greatest potential impact in terms of educational investments.,128,,
889,0.97,8116.241,8137.162,"We know if we start kids off on the right foot through prenatal services, through birth services and through those early learning years we will see much of the results for the rest of the spectrum of education for children all the way through the Seattle promise program.",128,,
890,0.97,8137.162,8166.625,And so I want to appreciate the work of Deel certainly director Dwane Chappelle and the entire team who has been really committed to making sure that there is racial equity at the center of all of our policies and investments and also in making sure they are deeply reaching in the community to make sure that the Deel budget and priorities represent the greatest needs of those who are Furthest away from educational justice.,128,,
891,0.97,8166.625,8181.239,As we have been reading and hearing the last 19 months the impact of the pandemic particularly on young people Includig families dating Childcare and service providers has been huge.,128,,
892,0.97,8181.239,8211.57,I am grateful to the many public servants over at Deel working hard to pivot and provide flexibility and resources to actually be responsive to the public health measures that we have all had to take to be safe and to continue to find different and innovative ways to support providers or educators and students and their families to make sure that their education is able to continue and really appreciate all of the hard work.,128,,
893,0.97,8211.57,8253.111,I think the proposed budget before us today is a reflection of Deel and the interest in seeing young people Holistically rather than just focusing on the Widget that can be academic outcomes and that requires us to make investments in our young people to show them that we value them as individuals and a family member and that they are indeed an important part of the community so I think this is a really good start to the Deel investment in our youngest learners and in future leaders in the city.,128,,
894,0.97,8253.111,8255.313,Appreciate all the work that went into this budget.,128,,
895,0.97,8255.313,8263.088,I do have a couple of questions that I will go ahead and put out with the permission of the chair.,128,,
896,0.97,8263.088,8265.924,Go ahead.,129,,
897,0.97,8265.924,8284.542,"The first question that I have director for you or anyone from your team is really related about, is really related to Prioritization of dollars particularly from under spend.",130,,
898,0.97,8284.542,8304.629,"In spite of the levy ordinance that talks about the implementation and evaluation plan and how a levee will be Prioritized, we do see a significant investment in Seattle promise over the early learning programs.",130,,
899,0.97,8304.629,8322.781,That are designated to receive a bulk of levee investment and just wanted to give a sense about the Deel analysis for that Prioritization decision in this proposed budget.,130,,
900,0.97,8322.781,8328.153,"Yes, brad would you like to speak to that?",131,,
901,0.97,8328.153,8331.489,Yeah.,132,,
902,0.97,8331.489,8333.892,Thank you so much for the question.,132,,
903,0.97,8333.892,8348.106,I think with the under spend right now there is a communication coming to Council soon from the levy oversight committee regarding some of those previous year under spend.,132,,
904,0.97,8348.106,8365.89,"But yes promise is a good portion of that where there is pressure on the Seattle promise program and there is some early learning pressures as well and some of those, I don't know if you want to speak to those at all.",132,,
905,0.97,8365.89,8378.436,"Sure, the 2022 proposed budget does not include any use of under spend and the reason is we are looking ahead and seeing the cost pressure and other concerns.",133,,
906,0.97,8378.436,8382.173,So we are working with the LOC to present some information about that.,133,,
907,0.97,8382.173,8388.446,The short answer is it is not included in the 2022 budget.,133,,
908,0.97,8388.446,8397.055,Spot no understand from Fep levy baked into the 2022 proposed budget?,133,,
909,0.97,8397.055,8398.656,So where is that?,133,,
910,0.97,8398.656,8402.16,There is under spend?,133,,
911,0.97,8402.16,8411.569,There is under spend currently parked in reserve and I think the intent is to use the funds in a specific way.,134,,
912,0.97,8411.569,8418.476,One is to deal with the cost pressures that we forecast that will be beyond levee resources.,134,,
913,0.97,8418.476,8433.792,"So at the LOC, working with us on that I believe there is communication coming out soon and we have support about what to do with those reserves so the short answer is we are reserving them for a specific purpose.",134,,
914,0.97,8433.792,8437.562,We remind me that amount?,135,,
915,0.97,8437.562,8441.666,$10 million.,136,,
916,0.97,8441.666,8484.042,"We are looking ahead to the period from now until we reach the point of levee renewal, seeing commitments and the desired funding for the range of programs that are supported by the levy and other resources and seeing if we get through 2022 with the resources we have but they will be having potential funding shortfalls in 23 or 24 so holding the funding and anticipating those needs, it is the longer perspective and allocating resources and obviously we will provide that detail, it comes from the Forward-Looking Timeline and the gap between the numbers here and the potential levee renewal.",137,,
917,0.97,8484.042,8499.224,"Okay so I would appreciate having details related to the analysis, related to that Prioritization decision.",138,,
918,0.97,8499.224,8513.972,I know that the levy oversight committee has responsibility for at least in the advisory nature taking a look at some modifications to the implementation and evaluation plan.,138,,
919,0.97,8513.972,8544.602,But I am really looking for the Nitty-Gritty details about what information was presented to the levy oversight committee and sort of what deals rationale for contravening the implementation and evaluation plan ordinance and the actual levy ordinance that talks about how we are going to Prioritize under spend.,138,,
920,0.97,8544.602,8573.531,"I want a clear understanding and I think taxpayers in the city who voted in favor of the levy deserve a clear transparent understanding of why we are, why we are likely going to see that under spend dollars for which the ordinance related to the levy says 100% of that should go to early learning programming it's likely not going to go.",138,,
921,0.97,8573.531,8576.801,Exclusively to early learning planning.,138,,
922,0.97,8576.801,8582.54,Okay yes I am more than happy to follow up with you on that.,139,,
923,0.97,8582.54,8610.802,"I know has already been having communications with you all because I have put a bug in his ear about it based on communications that I get on the levy oversight committee side so I know you all are going to work hard to make sure we have clarity but I am interested in making sure we understand the importance of Seattle promise, I support Seattle promise, I have been a longtime supporter and I want to continue supporting the program.",140,,
924,0.97,8610.802,8634.158,I think what I am flagging like I always do every time we talk about budget related to Fep I am flagging a revenue source question not a commitment to continuing to grow and invest in Seattle promise which I know is really important as part of the education spectrum.,140,,
925,0.97,8634.158,8667.125,"Just want to make clear in my line of questioning I'm not Equivocating my support of Seattle promise I just have a question about the source of the revenue and if it is appropriate for us considering the levy ordinance to utilize under spend dedicated to early learning, to the outward years of Seattle promise when presumably we will not be dealing with the same pandemic pressures that necessitated us to be more careful in how we use the under spend.",140,,
926,0.97,8667.125,8676.0,"That is one line of questioning, appreciate the opportunity to get additional information about that.",140,,
927,0.97,8676.0,8684.942,"The second piece, I had another question about investments being proposed here.",140,,
928,0.97,8684.942,8707.932,Can you talk me through a little bit about how the Eci investments proposed in the 2022 budget are either Duplicative or not investments in a Fep levy particularly in diversity and family support and youth programming.,140,,
929,0.97,8707.932,8751.175,"I would say as you know about Eci investments when we are looking at as I mentioned I think it is designated to benefit the youth that are impacted by systemic inequities happening in education and some of those areas were identified as I mentioned family support and engagement, youth leadership and cultural education and education diversity identified by the task force and what we are doing is making sure we are intentional, we are working directly with the CBO other than SPs to focus on these specific areas.",141,,
930,0.97,8751.175,8754.178,I'm hoping I'm answering the question.,141,,
931,0.97,8754.178,8756.714,Kind of.,142,,
932,0.97,8756.714,8767.125,It sounds like if it's going to CBO's it sounds like it's more in the opportunity fund sort of space.,142,,
933,0.97,8767.125,8794.819,In other words I'm trying to get an understanding of how this complements the Fep levy investments if it does or if it is fair to characterize these Eci proposed investments as Standalone programming that are not necessarily in conflict but are not part and parcel of things we are investing in the opportunity fund or otherwise.,142,,
934,0.97,8794.819,8832.29,"That is understandable because I know for example and if I get to rambling just cut me off, for example the education diversity piece, we have investment through the Fep levy directly through SPs where the Eci task force wanted to make sure that these funds were directly with invested in communities and know that we are still developing this and our intention is really to make sure that it's going to complement the Fep.",143,,
935,0.97,8832.29,8841.065,As I get more information if we develop it even more I'm happy to share updates with you from there.,143,,
936,0.97,8841.065,8842.3,Okay.,144,,
937,0.97,8842.3,8852.777,All right so Brian from Council central stuff can help me keep tracking this one it would be helpful.,144,,
938,0.97,8852.777,8868.926,"I want to make sure, you know we have limited resources and I want to make sure we are you know again this is more of a color of money question than whether or not it is the right investment.",144,,
939,0.97,8868.926,8872.43,So that is why I am asking these questions.,144,,
940,0.97,8872.43,8898.656,"We have limited resources and I want to make sure we can free up the general fund where we can hear the last question and then I will hand it back over to chair, during the 2021 budget we had I think about $4 million of undesignated fund balance to sustain early learning.",144,,
941,0.97,8898.656,8935.893,I think I saw sort of a nod of that fund balance for early learning somewhere in a list of Prioritization's by Deel and I am just wondering if that $4 million is represented anywhere in your proposed 2022 budget or if those were 2021 dollars and if they are if we can get a quick status update on where you're at as it relates to the $4 million undesignated fund balance.,144,,
942,0.97,8935.893,8940.197,Monica?,145,,
943,0.97,8940.197,8952.91,This is from your June second memo from Deel to the city budget office.,146,,
944,0.97,8952.91,8962.82,"Yeah, so again the short answer is there is no use of undesignated fund balance in the 2022 proposed budget.",147,,
945,0.97,8962.82,8976.233,I think I'll need to research this a little bit more but my first thought is 4 million is included in the total 10 million that I mentioned just Consolidated together but I want to be sure about that.,147,,
946,0.97,8976.233,8988.846,If you can allow me to research that and be clear but I'm pretty sure it was rolled in and the 10 so we have not used that fund balance and.,147,,
947,0.97,8988.846,9003.861,That leads me to believe the $10 million in reserves might be a mixture of the previous levy plus the new levy and if that is true it would be helpful to get line item separation of those dollars.,148,,
948,0.97,9003.861,9010.868,"I'm sorry I misunderstood, you're talking about previous levy Spp undesignated.",149,,
949,0.97,9010.868,9012.47,"Potentially, yes.",150,,
950,0.97,9012.47,9022.546,I am looking at your memo to the CBO so it was a little confusing to me which is why I am asking the question.,150,,
951,0.97,9022.546,9034.992,"I cannot tell if the $4 million was identified as something that could come from the fel levy or if it was coming from the Fep, the new levy.",150,,
952,0.97,9034.992,9039.497,Let me do some research so I can give you a better answer.,151,,
953,0.97,9039.497,9044.402,I would prefer to look into that and give you a more accurate answer.,151,,
954,0.97,9044.402,9047.705,"Perfect, thank you.",152,,
955,0.97,9047.705,9050.574,Thank you very much.,153,,
956,0.97,9050.574,9054.278,I see hand from Councilmember Úmoraels.,153,,
957,0.97,9054.278,9059.316,Please go ahead.,153,,
958,0.97,9059.316,9061.685,"Thank you, good afternoon everybody and thank you for being here.",154,,
959,0.97,9061.685,9068.192,I have a couple questions following up on Council budget actions from last year.,154,,
960,0.97,9068.192,9086.844,"Spouse specifically one of the, 099 removes the 550,000 that we had put in last year for funding black girls and young women and trends youth.",154,,
961,0.97,9086.844,9120.578,"So I understand that was one time funding but my question is, there should be, I think about $395,000 left after the study was done so if you can tell us what the status of the funding is and then also in our formal request last year we asked for the Deel 18 plan to commit ongoing funding so if you can tell us the plan for that, that would be great.",154,,
962,0.97,9120.578,9125.983,Brad are you able to speak to that?,155,,
963,0.97,9125.983,9131.889,From a programmatic perspective I am probably not the person to ask for that one.,156,,
964,0.97,9131.889,9135.359,Regarding the fund balance?,157,,
965,0.97,9135.359,9143.0,For the fund balance I have not checked on that lately to see where we are with fund balance so I'm not sure.,158,,
966,0.97,9143.0,9173.797,"What we will do is follow up with you, I can tell you as you mentioned, we have completed the study and there will be a Rfi at some point coming out soon for the black girls and Lgbt youth and I know we are in application development now and I'm happy to give you, happy to give you a more detailed update at a later time.",159,,
967,0.97,9173.797,9186.243,"Okay Yeah, if we can get an estimate of when to expect that, that would be very helpful especially since we were hoping the funding would be out this year.",160,,
968,0.97,9186.243,9196.053,"And the other thing we did last year, was to add 550,000 from the general fund for the restorative justice pilot program.",160,,
969,0.97,9196.053,9222.146,My understanding is the school district is searching for restorative justice coordinator at the District level which is exciting but I am not sure about the status of that funding and given the District is moving in this direction how Deel is planning to work in partnership with the district to invest in restorative justice practice in schools.,160,,
970,0.97,9222.146,9238.963,As you know Rainier Beach high school is really the forefront of trying to incorporate these principles into not just a curriculum but into the actual culture of the school and how staff and administrators work.,160,,
971,0.97,9238.963,9248.205,So I'm really interested in understanding the plan for admitting ongoing funding for restorative justice and education.,160,,
972,0.97,9248.205,9252.91,Folks have been asking for this for a while.,160,,
973,0.97,9252.91,9264.021,Absolutely again that is another one I would like to follow back up with you to share what thinking is and as you mentioned we do know how important practices are not only for youth but for adults as well.,161,,
974,0.97,9264.021,9270.828,I'm happy to focus some information and follow up with you on this with my team.,161,,
975,0.97,9270.828,9291.949,"Okay and I think the Council President asked about this, can you talk a little bit for the equity and cultural education fund what kind of organizations will apply and some examples of the programming you are expecting to be able to support with that $5 million.",162,,
976,0.97,9291.949,9296.654,Monica were you getting ready to say something?,163,,
977,0.97,9296.654,9312.636,"What I will do is, as I mentioned earlier with funding those areas we are still in the development and when I follow up with you I will add this to the list of things I can give you examples on.",163,,
978,0.97,9312.636,9321.779,"Because again as I mentioned, we are looking at the Rfi early quarter one of 2022.",163,,
979,0.97,9321.779,9324.481,"Okay, thank you.",164,,
980,0.97,9324.481,9330.888,If we could get an estimate of when to expect the plans for the first two questions that would be helpful.,164,,
981,0.97,9330.888,9333.457,Will do.,165,,
982,0.97,9333.457,9339.897,Thank you very much.,166,,
983,0.97,9339.897,9346.77,I'm going to take another attempt at a question that the Council President asked to make sure I fully understand as well.,166,,
984,0.97,9346.77,9354.545,Because I Teed that up I'm going to get this question and then call on you if that's okay.,166,,
985,0.97,9354.545,9372.529,When we look at slide two for Seattle promise noting the Seattle f are his one-time funding I want to make sure we're not setting ourselves up for a cliff in the future I want to make sure we are setting ourselves up for a well balanced budget in the future.,166,,
986,0.97,9372.529,9384.842,"So the increased enrollment, that is a short-term thing is that a short-term thing or is there expectation we will need ongoing additional resources?",166,,
987,0.97,9384.842,9388.345,I can answer that one.,167,,
988,0.97,9388.345,9415.005,"For increased enrollment as mentioned we are probably going to serve over 1000 students this year for promise, the Fep levy when it was designed we would Max out around 870 students so it's hard to predict the future beyond next year but the trend we are seeing is promise is popular and successful and people are coming into that.",167,,
989,0.97,9415.005,9423.981,So Fep was designed to serve 870 students so that's the cost structure in terms of sustained funding.,167,,
990,0.97,9423.981,9520.177,"If I can add this is not a surprise and I want to be really transparent when we were Deliberating the construction of the Fep levy we had a very intentional conversation that the estimates of enrollment were conservative at best and we anticipated that there would be a study increase in enrollment that was not already baked into the budget and at the time, the intention is Prioritizing the dollars generated from levy and when we asked voters to consider approving the Fep levy we gave them a commitment that a significant portion of the dollars would be spent in early learning program and in the Seattle preschool program including any and all under spend dollars so we have a real tension we have to figure out how to address through fiscal policies because of the popularity of Seattle promise and we have a little bit of you know relief and room to work on how we would answer the question but I do want to highlight and flag that we do need to resolve for the reality of ongoing increased demand to a very popular program.",168,,
991,0.97,9520.177,9538.862,That is I believe at this point in juncture not sustainable if we are looking at solely the Fep levy dollars to continue to increase you know the opportunity for students in public schools to continue to enroll.,168,,
992,0.97,9538.862,9560.217,You know if Allie or Brian want to Chime in on any of those perspectives I have offered or correct me in anyway I would sort of be happy to hear from them as well.,168,,
993,0.97,9560.217,9588.845,"I went out and then asked Brian to fill in additional details, we talked a great deal about the projections when the levee plan was being put together and I believe there is direction because we anticipated this may be where we land to consider income restrictions or at least Prioritization when and if we are reaching the point where demand is exceeding the Fep levy resources.",169,,
994,0.97,9588.845,9590.714,That I get that right?,169,,
995,0.97,9590.714,9602.926,"Yes thank you, I don't have the reference in front of me but that is true, there's contingency if the aroma is too high and cost is too high we could have income restriction considered.",170,,
996,0.97,9602.926,9605.862,So that's correct.,170,,
997,0.97,9605.862,9673.196,"Also emphasizing the issue with the proposed Allocaton 6.7 million of the Seattle dollars the presumption is not that they are all spent in 2022 they Ramped down into 2023 anticipating exactly this issue about what is a sustainable approach and potential reliance on other resources in Deel so just to emphasize we bring the full plan around and work with Brian and central staff to show you the overall plan for the next few years for both promise programs with increased enrollment and additional offerings with additional programs where targeting particularly to the cohorts most affected by covert, ideally we return the stain person education and we won't have those issues continuing but we certainly see the additional, the need for additional support for students who are in high school remote and are entering community college under the same terms.",171,,
998,0.97,9673.196,9682.139,In any case it is a multiyear plan and should be seen in that light and we will provide those details to you and to Brian.,171,,
999,0.97,9682.139,9729.653,"I also want to say, I think you as everyone is in support of Seattle promise it is part of my vision to make sure our way should say the program is going to be sustained meaning long-term to make sure there is the necessary support moving forward and the, the Clifford funds are really intended to pilot equitable approaches that are currently not being funded on Fep levy . So I wanted to make sure I said that because you know we want to make sure our scholars in those cohorts are supported and to see them through so I wanted to share that.",172,,
1000,0.97,9729.653,9731.888,Thank you all for calling this out I appreciate it.,172,,
1001,0.97,9731.888,9751.708,"Yeah, I think all of what the directors are saying is accurate and I think where the tension exists is sort of are we robbing Peter to pay Paul and I feel like we're getting very close to that.",173,,
1002,0.97,9751.708,9823.18,"And I worry about that because we make commitments to the voters in the city about how these dollars are going to be Prioritized and utilized and again, I agree these dollars give us a little bit of breathing room to solve for the issue but I would like to encourage us if at all possible during this particular budget process to identify a framework with mechanisms by which we can come to an agreement of how we're going to analyze Sustainability of the Seattle promise program in a way that allows us to stay true and committed to the other side of the education spectrum which you know that part of the pipeline is also critically important to allowing a universal no income restriction Seattle promise program to deliver on the promise of educational justice for those students and scholars who may not otherwise even make it through middle school much less high school.",173,,
1003,0.97,9823.18,9851.341,I really think we can do both and I really want to identify how we can Collaboratively identify that process by which we can reconcile these important priorities so we are not in a situation of compromising the pipeline up front in a way that will have impacts on who will be able to participate in the Seattle promise program in the future.,173,,
1004,0.97,9851.341,9859.282,"Thank you Council President, well said.",174,,
1005,0.97,9859.282,9862.118,Councilmember Pedersen thank you for waiting I will turn it over to you.,174,,
1006,0.97,9862.118,9869.125,Thank you chair Mosqueda and director and I have my Seattle preschool program sign behind me.,175,,
1007,0.97,9869.125,9880.637,Thank you for your hard work and your team implementing that program and thank you Council President Gonzalez for leading the efforts on the Council side of things.,175,,
1008,0.97,9880.637,9911.668,"In looking at the budget document because we break it into these budget control levels sometimes we don't see all the programmatic detail and two programs I am interested in, early learning realm that Council President was talking about earlier, the nurse family partnership program and the parent-child home program . As you know they're both Evidence- based home Visitation programs.",175,,
1009,0.97,9911.668,9917.574,Want to make sure will the funding be maintained from 2021 to 2022?,175,,
1010,0.97,9917.574,9944.1,Happy to come the nurse program continues as is so the funding does not change and then the parent child program as we mentioned in slide two or three rather the funding continues to be used so the will continue funding one more year.,176,,
1011,0.97,9944.1,9946.803,Does that answer your question?,176,,
1012,0.97,9946.803,9957.113,"Thank you, is that the program the United way okay thank you very much.",177,,
1013,0.97,9957.113,9960.116,Anything else colleagues?,178,,
1014,0.97,9960.116,9961.384,Please go ahead.,178,,
1015,0.97,9961.384,9979.336,"Sorry on the program the parent childhood home program, plus the, regardless of the revenue source, the funding is the same as last year.",179,,
1016,0.97,9979.336,9982.605,Correct.,180,,
1017,0.97,9982.605,9986.509,"Actually a little bit higher, we added some inflation.",180,,
1018,0.97,9986.509,9993.717,"Okay that was my read as well it seems a little higher but I'm not sure it was not, it is nominal.",181,,
1019,0.97,9993.717,10002.926,"Okay so here is another, this is sort of another Sustainability question.",181,,
1020,0.97,10002.926,10009.265,"The families and education levee, the previous levee you know that under spend will not last forever.",181,,
1021,0.97,10009.265,10048.872,"I am a little surprised we still have it but again, this is another Sustainability question, there is strong interest on the Council to continue to support that programming and we do not currently have a dedicated revenue fund for it but we did in crafting the Fep levy create language that would qualify Pchp and similar programming to now be Prioritized through our Fep levy dollars.",181,,
1022,0.97,10048.872,10086.843,"Again we are seeing this, last year we had a lot of under spend in the Fep levy that came from the Childcare investment area but I see Pchp as part of the early learning spectrum and this is the policy question around what do we want to Prioritize the under spend dollars in a way that allows these critically important and valuable programs to be sustainable into the future so that you know the Community- based organizations are not dealing with uncertainty of whether or not they will see the same level of investment or increasing levels of investment to serve more children and their homes.",181,,
1023,0.97,10086.843,10098.755,"So, again putting this on the table as something that I think we should do because I feel we are getting close to the precipice.",181,,
1024,0.97,10098.755,10111.768,I think it would be prudent for us to set up a process and conversation about how to address out your Sustainability for that particular program as well.,181,,
1025,0.97,10111.768,10117.941,"Okay, thank you for that.",182,,
1026,0.97,10117.941,10119.576,Excellent.,183,,
1027,0.97,10119.576,10128.084,"I am not seeing any additional hands, I want to thank members of Deel for being here with us today.",183,,
1028,0.97,10128.084,10150.707,"As restated and heard from you remember we are appreciative of the work you have done and look forward to not only making sure families have the support services that Deel provides but that the workforce has the support they need as well, as we talk about the entire age range that Deel serves.",183,,
1029,0.97,10150.707,10182.238,"We know all the investments are needed as we seek to be more equitable and as Councilmembers have been saying we want to make sure it is sustainable and that we are Pairing these investments with other committed funds and that is what we will be looking at over the next few weeks as we make sure our values, council priorities and investments, voter priorities are well reflected in the budget so thank you for walking us through this today and with that we have reached the end of our presentations.",183,,
1030,0.97,10182.238,10184.741,The next agenda will start tomorrow.,183,,

1033,0.97,10204.027,10215.271,Starting with office of housing than human services and we will have the citywide homelessness response representatives as well to talk about the transition and how that will run.,183,,
