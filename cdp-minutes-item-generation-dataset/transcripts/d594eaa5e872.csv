31,0.97,161.594,199.766,"Regardless of whether it is official business or electoral work, that kind of behavior in Subjecting people in our city to those--that type of hatred is absolutely beyond the pale, and I know that all of you join me in admonishing and rejecting that kind of harmful, Hurtful racism being subjected to any member of our community, and when it hits home like it has for us here on my team, it is particularly painful.",19,,
32,0.97,199.766,217.05,"So, I hope you all will join me in calling out that behavior and in helping my team support my chief of staff, Breanna Thomas in that moment she continues to process the events of last week.",19,,

41,0.97,272.505,285.685,"As you mentioned, we can't Pat ourselves on the back for having a Federal holiday declared when that type of racist language is used in an overt and explicit way against any member of our team or any member of our community.",21,,

46,0.97,321.688,327.16,We are all I think in a position to recognize the importance of Juneteenth.,21,,
47,0.97,327.16,331.531,I did hear so many people over the weekend talk about how this is not a celebration necessarily.,21,,
48,0.97,331.531,338.504,This is a day of acknowledgment of decades of delayed action.,21,,
49,0.97,338.504,350.116,"Here in 2021, when the Federal Government has finally recognized Juneteenth, we still see States like Texas pushing Anti-Boating disenfranchisement laws.",21,,
50,0.97,350.116,351.718,Been in critical race theory.,21,,
51,0.97,351.718,361.027,Also here in our own backyard we must fight against any effort to Co-Opt June seen.,21,,
52,0.97,361.027,374.44,While we simultaneously create policies that [Indiscernible] previously status quo that cause more harm especially to the black and Brown communities of Seattle.,21,,
53,0.97,374.44,378.044,"So, while we acknowledge the importance of Juneteenth, we will continue to fight.",21,,
54,0.97,378.044,396.362,"We will continued to fight tort action, to fight against racism and recognizing the tremendous demands to undo decades if not centuries of Regressive policies that actually are at the root of an equitable housing, inequitable education and security.",21,,
55,0.97,396.362,404.537,And health disparities as we continue to see health disparities continue in this moment of Covid.,21,,

62,0.97,453.92,460.593,We do have three items from the Finance and housing Committee on today's full council agenda.,21,,
63,0.97,460.593,462.728,The first two relate to the Seattle rescue plan act.,21,,

65,0.97,473.339,500.833,"I want to thank all of you Council colleagues, as this is a very exciting opportunity for us to pass the Seattle rescue plan act two weeks ago I, along with Council President Gonzalez, introduced this legislation package with the mayors' office with keeping in mind with the resolution that you passed to create the appropriation to reflect the diversity of opinion amongst our elected officials and the diversity of things we heard from community constituency called in over the multiple opportunities that we had for public testimony.",21,,
66,0.97,500.833,506.072,"As you'll recall, this is the first tranche of the American rescue plan act dollars.",21,,
67,0.97,506.072,514.18,Seattle's portion of the Federal dollars totals $232 million.,21,,
68,0.97,514.18,526.592,"Today's bill in front of us is an opportunity to pass the first half of that, $160 million, along with $12.2 million that come from the home investment partnership fund dollars.",21,,
69,0.97,526.592,537.169,"These bills are the result of Council bill--excuse me Council resolution 13999 passed in March and the five Vestment community meetings that we had to hear what was happening in other cities, and directly within the city of Seattle.",21,,
70,0.97,537.169,544.677,Directly hearing from folks who have been disproportionately impacted due to the consequences of Covid.,21,,

74,0.97,573.472,585.117,We have an opportunity here to make a significant investment in helping to address the Harms caused by Covid both in terms of lost lives and lost livelihoods.,21,,
75,0.97,585.117,590.356,When you think both the physical health consequences of the economic health consequences imposed on our community.,21,,
76,0.97,590.356,598.064,"I want to recognize again that $160 million, even adding the extra $12 million from the home investment plan is not enough.",21,,
77,0.97,598.064,610.676,Today's package of $120 million is really important first step in this infusion provides an incredible one-time opportunity to commit resources to our communities most affected.,21,,
78,0.97,610.676,616.182,Is definitely not enough to create the equity Oh economy that we are all accountable to.,21,,
79,0.97,616.182,629.996,"This the first step in the first tranche to the building blocks that we will continue to put together throughout August, September, and October as we work on the budget in front of us and into the ongoing years.",21,,

88,0.97,706.672,721.02,This update in 2021 offers the opportunity to couple those important changes by making sure that we are increasing the office of housing's homeownership subsidy to make sure we are adequately and equitably funding the construction of affordable homes.,21,,
89,0.97,721.02,736.202,We are moving--removing the cap on the acquisition authority when there are new revenue sources available so that the city can move quickly to seize opportunities to acquire properties for the creation of affordable housing given changes in the market.,21,,

109,0.97,899.732,913.145,"Especially to communities in low income areas and among communities of color, but the hardship and the public health crises that is being created by having disproportionate policing related to the helmet law is something that the board of health will begin taking up.",21,,
110,0.97,913.145,935.701,"It seemed unanimous in terms of our discussion that we will continue to look at how we can reform that antiquated approach as we look towards more Holistic public health solutions to making sure folks can wear a helmet, have access to it, but not are enforcing it through punitive and--harmful measures that rely on law enforcement only.",21,,

213,0.97,1710.375,1732.764,"He says specifically as it relates to the expansion of choose 180, that as the Council considers expanding diversion options for this group, it should explore restorative Justice-Based programming because intervention should be matched to an individual's risk to Reoffend.",25,,
214,0.97,1732.764,1740.672,"Individuals with a lower risk level would require a lighter touch, which restorative justice Conferencing could provide.",25,,
215,0.97,1740.672,1744.509,"So, we don't have much in the way of restorative justice for ages above 25.",25,,
216,0.97,1744.509,1752.016,We don't have much in the way of a diversion program for Nonspecialized groups of people.,25,,

504,0.97,4142.605,4162.925,"One of the things we discovered when we received all the applications in 2019 is that they're just simply weren't enough applicants who were seeking to find the needs of people living in del ridge, Georgetown, and Southpark.",37,,
505,0.97,4162.925,4180.809,"So, in order to address that, Hsd I think very wisely decided to issue a second Rfp to really focus on needs of folks in del ridge, Georgetown, and Southpark.",37,,
506,0.97,4180.809,4189.952,"They put aside about $223,000 for the needs of those communities.",37,,

598,0.97,4813.542,4816.978,I think what's left behind is a resiliency and the fact that we are still here.,46,,
599,0.97,4816.978,4822.083,Indian country today did a great article back last week.,46,,

605,0.97,4871.032,4881.61,"This also goes back to some of the legislation we looked at regarding missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, and the Indian child welfare act of 1978.",46,,
606,0.97,4881.61,4885.447,In which this government had a policy of removing children from their families.,46,,
607,0.97,4885.447,4914.075,"So, this is going to be a very emotional, but important piece of legislation to, not only to acknowledge the trauma, and the horrific history, of trying to wipe away our culture, our children, our history, our language, but for me, as always, moving forward is the healing and the comfort and the discussion to address this.",46,,
608,0.97,4914.075,4923.451,"That we can still celebrate, that is made of people, that is tribal governments as sovereign governments, that we are still here and we will continue to be here.",46,,

629,0.97,5041.069,5043.104,There has been some concern and discussion about maybe Mr.,46,,
630,0.97,5043.104,5046.307,Lewis did not have a connection with the city of Seattle.,46,,
631,0.97,5046.307,5051.613,"He did visit the University of Washington in 2017, but neither did George Washington or Mr.",46,,

633,0.97,5053.415,5067.028,"With that, I think we have to look at how we decide what is history, how it is commemorated, who our heroes are, who made history, and who is in a position to acknowledge and honor those folks so people do ask those questions.",46,,
634,0.97,5067.028,5073.334,"I will be looking forward to this Council's support in the naming of this bridge, which is phenomenal.",46,,

655,0.97,5174.702,5186.514,Can you give me a sense of how much buffer time you need between the adjournment of full Council and the time before we can get going on the District's meeting?,47,,
656,0.97,5186.514,5191.953,I'm assuming you've had conversations with technology in the clerk's office.,47,,
657,0.97,5191.953,5199.26,I don't anticipate--I mean if you need 10 or 15 minutes that would be fine.,48,,

660,0.97,5205.366,5207.168,It's pretty straightforward.,48,,
661,0.97,5207.168,5214.475,"I don't anticipate--so, if you want to do a 10 or 15 minute break that's fine.",48,,
662,0.97,5214.475,5222.25,"I will confer with the clerk's office, and technology, just to make sure that we can make the switch that Seattle channel can make the switch.",49,,
663,0.97,5222.25,5226.087,Which I think is going to be the biggest delay.,49,,
664,0.97,5226.087,5228.489,"Normally, in real life, we could do it pretty quickly.",49,,
665,0.97,5228.489,5246.207,"But, the technology--we will make sure to let folks know how we are going to move forward before we enter and adjourn full council so that we can all get back in our seats wearing a different hat.",49,,

677,0.97,5319.547,5327.255,"Obviously private contributions are no replacement for steady, consistent, and reliable investments in housing and homelessness services through progressive revenue.",51,,
678,0.97,5327.255,5351.212,"But, when people in the community are standing up with an interest in giving the city funds to lean into successful strategies, and have been getting our experiencing homelessness inside, I believe it is our responsibility to provide an outlet for people to Ngage in that level of servant leadership if that is how they want to be a part of the solution.",51,,

692,0.97,5505.967,5528.155,"It was an opportunity to bring together the unique coalition that helped remove a very problematic encampment that was on third Avenue, but guarantee shelter and services and assistance to everyone living in that encampment and to do it in the just care model where there is no displacement of people who are living outside.",51,,
693,0.97,5528.155,5550.311,"This model, as we have discussed several times here at Council, centers the interests of people who are living unsheltered, as well as the interest of housed community members and business owners to lead to the resolution that all parties want to see, which is people getting inside getting the services and assistance they need.",51,,
694,0.97,5550.311,5563.09,While Additionally making sure the public spaces are there for everybody to enjoy and not to be used as an Unsanctioned shelter when people should be living in places with four walls and a door that locks.,51,,

707,0.97,5668.696,5673.134,This truly is the approach that we should be leaning into more.,51,,
708,0.97,5673.134,5680.041,Especially as we go into budget season to talk about what the future system of homelessness outreach in the city of Seattle will be.,51,,
709,0.97,5680.041,5693.054,"It's a way we can work together as a County, as a city, and really move the ball forward and really center the politics of collaboration instead of the politics of conflict.",51,,

731,0.97,5850.778,5870.197,"On regional committees, the board of health last week, we had a meeting where we discussed at length, among other items, the helmet law as I foreshadowed in my remarks last week that we would hear the presentation.",51,,
732,0.97,5870.197,5881.342,"My quick summary of the findings, I'm not sure if my colleagues, Councilmember Mosqueda and Morales touched on this in their presentations or not, as I was not present.",51,,
