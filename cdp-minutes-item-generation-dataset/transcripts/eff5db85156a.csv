168,0.97,1279.444,1287.686,"That standard needs to not be a reasonable police officer, because reasonable police officers in the city have gone to Washington, D.C. to participate in the insurrection against the Federal Government . It needs to be an average citizen of Seattle.",40,,
169,0.97,1287.753,1291.056,This is a problem with a lot of laws around the police in general.,40,,
170,0.97,1291.123,1293.759,They use this reasonable officer Standard and police are not reasonable.,40,,
171,0.97,1293.825,1309.274,"The second issue that we need to address is the use of bikes by the police Department . There are a number of cases, 2019 0880 being one of them, where a police officer rides his bike into somebody, which would be an assault if I did it.",40,,
172,0.97,1309.341,1322.354,Then they use that contact and that persons laugh of immediate deference and submission to justify arresting and deploying additional force against that individual.,40,,
173,0.97,1322.421,1324.156,Police have done this to protesters.,40,,
174,0.97,1324.222,1337.436,Police have done this to somebody who is not even involved in the demonstration . They also slammed another woman up against a building in the process of doing that.,40,,
175,0.97,1337.502,1341.54,They did not arrest her because she said I am sorry to the officer who hit her with a bike.,40,,
176,0.97,1341.606,1352.651,"We saw a police officer who has not been fired right his bike over the head of a Protester . I think that we do have, and I know there have been some recommendations around those kinds of uses of force, but they need to be more heavily codified.",40,,
177,0.97,1352.718,1356.354,"Lastly, well I think I'm out of time, so I may just Email you the last part.",40,,
178,0.97,1356.421,1362.427,I just think we really need to keep these bans up and keep pushing on the police.,40,,
179,0.97,1362.494,1362.828,Thank you.,40,,
180,0.97,1362.894,1363.829,"Thank you, Eric.",41,,

184,0.97,1385.917,1391.056,"A lot of the violence, myself and--we had in an assault on July 25.",42,,
185,0.97,1391.123,1399.998,I still have physical therapy . I still have nightmares.,42,,
186,0.97,1400.065,1426.057,"[no Audio] we need a ban on crawl control weapons, military weapons, and the people calling in against it, those of the same people who probably would storm the capital.",42,,
187,0.97,1429.795,1431.363,I want Counsell to start taking this seriously.,42,,
188,0.97,1431.429,1432.13,Our trauma is real.,42,,
189,0.97,1432.197,1433.131,There is real suffering.,42,,
190,0.97,1433.198,1434.933,We need a full ban on crawl control weapons.,42,,
191,0.97,1435.0,1436.568,Police should not be throwing Flashbangs at our heads.,42,,
192,0.97,1436.635,1441.039,They should not be gassing us . They should not be pepper spray and people like me so they go to the hospital.,42,,
193,0.97,1441.106,1442.541,None of this should be happening.,42,,
194,0.97,1442.607,1448.346,I also have a strong critique of why counsel is acting surprised and why Mike Solan's behavior now is Inadmissible when he has been acting like this the whole time.,42,,
195,0.97,1448.413,1459.891,"Mike Solan and Carmen best have been lying about Blm activists since May, putting us in danger of car Supremacists--white Supremacists.",42,,
196,0.97,1459.958,1472.103,"Remember when they called an Unlit candle an Ied and that was blasted all over, that we were having explosives?",42,,
197,0.97,1472.17,1496.394,"It was a Memorial candle . You remember when Mike Solan blasted stable holes cowboy while they blessed us with joy? remember when they said we Extorted businesses that gun point, which is also proven false?",42,,
198,0.97,1496.461,1497.329,These lies are not due.,42,,
199,0.97,1497.395,1501.233,"This behavior is not new . Mike Solan has been trying to do this all along, telling all these lies.",42,,
200,0.97,1501.299,1502.4,We have been attacked all along.,42,,
201,0.97,1502.467,1505.303,It only seems that counsel cares now that White Supremacists are attacking politicians.,42,,

210,0.97,1556.521,1587.485,"Dear Council members, please remember we hold you accountable for the violence SPD inflicts on our community . You can make the police friends instead of the racist and violent enemies they have become and you have enabled . They ride bikes over our schools, beat us while we are handcuffed, dress and act like a for military, and attack us with crawl control weapons . only you can stop this.",43,,
211,0.97,1587.552,1606.604,"It would be Criminally negligent for you to weaken the chemical weapons ban Fascist leaning, right wing leaning SPD only Terrorize the public when using these weapons against protesters.",43,,
212,0.97,1606.671,1618.75,"You must make the SPD accountable to civilian rule . no more independence, no more above the law nonsense, the were licensed to harming kill citizens, no more corrupt Opae investigations.",43,,
213,0.97,1618.817,1621.853,You must create a citizen led OPA without any police collaborators corrupting the process of justice.,43,,
214,0.97,1621.92,1624.356,Opa is loaded with Stonewalling advocates who prevent justice at every opportunity.,43,,
215,0.97,1624.422,1625.991,Opa is a farce as it currently exists.,43,,
216,0.97,1626.057,1626.891,Get rid of Mike Solan.,43,,
217,0.97,1626.958,1627.892,He is a toxic Fascist.,43,,

225,0.97,1649.914,1678.076,"I am a member of district 7. I am calling because I am very concerned about us repealing a ban on weapons of warfare . These agents not only affect the peaceful protesters who are exercising their constitutional rights, but it also affects the neighborhood in which these weapons are deployed.",47,,
226,0.97,1678.143,1682.881,"There are children living here . There are pets living in these apartments that are affected by this tear gas, by these glass bombs.",47,,
227,0.97,1682.947,1710.775,"It is Traumatizing to these people in these neighborhoods . It is also strange to me that in order to get a Federal consent decree lifted, which addressed the use of excessive force by the SPD, we are trying to repeal a ban which allows the use of excessive force . sorry, it is very frustrating to have to explain all this . These are lethal weapons and less than lethal weapons, so I'm very frustrated.",47,,
228,0.97,1710.842,1716.214,I feel we need to Reimagine how we handle concerns that the community is trying to give their elected officials.,47,,
229,0.97,1716.281,1717.682,Protests are concerns.,47,,
230,0.97,1717.749,1732.597,"The working class people, everyday people are trying to explain to you that this is how we feel about things.",47,,

240,0.97,1755.52,1791.623,"This past summer, with all the Blm protests and the systemic racism, I was at home watching news of kids younger than me being Maced in the eye, protesters blinded with rubber bullets, and it looks like hunger games, honestly.",51,,
241,0.97,1791.689,1792.457,It was crazy.,51,,
242,0.97,1792.524,1793.057,It was really crazy.,51,,
243,0.97,1793.124,1841.372,"I was scared to go to protests because a lot of them were peaceful and still the chemical weapons would get broken out . I do not think this is okay . a lot of these weapons that are used definitely do need to be reserved for--seem to be reserved for left wing and black lives matter Plaza's . As we saw last week when white nationalists staged an Atempted coup on the whole of Congress and were for the most part escorted out peacefully while tear gas, which is a substance actually banned by the Geneva convention, it is banned from warfare.",51,,
244,0.97,1841.439,1845.176,It should not be used on peaceful protests.,51,,

253,0.97,1897.929,1941.873,"We are waiting for additional data regarding separations from the police Department, separations of officers who have left the police Department . that impacts both the remaining 2020 budget, as well as it impacts the number of dollars that can be spent in 2021 by the Seattle police Department and ultimately would impact our deliberations around this bill . So each central staff, the city budget office, and the Mayor's office have requested additional time to get that important financial information that we need for continued deliberations.",52,,
254,0.97,1941.939,1963.061,"I agreed, because I too want to have the ability to make budget decisions based on real information about the financial situation of the Department . hopefully we will be bringing that bill forward in our next meeting on the 26th.",52,,

338,0.97,2739.87,2743.474,I appreciate you bringing these items forward today.,69,,
339,0.97,2743.54,2762.459,I welcome all the comments by Reverend Walden and other speakers . I just wanted to welcome the new appointees and the Re-Appointees.,69,,
340,0.97,2762.526,2764.228,I wanted to make a few general comments.,69,,
341,0.97,2764.294,2785.182,"The community police Commission, in my view, has been the only one of what I would call the accountability partners consistently defend the rights of people who have been brutalized by police officers.",69,,
342,0.97,2785.249,2793.824,"We heard a lot of public comment about it, as well . leader on in the agenda, we will discuss the ban on crowd control weapons.",69,,
343,0.97,2793.891,2821.552,"I remember that when this was discussed over the summer, to my recollection, only the CPC among the so-called accountability partners talked about the harm done to many people in the black lives matter Plaza movement by the Seattle police Department and specifically in the agenda later on today, we will see the recommendations about the So- called crowd control weapons proposed by the CPC, which I believe are good and strong recommendations.",69,,
344,0.97,2821.618,2830.894,"They stand in stark contrast to the recommendations from the other accountability partners, the office of Inspector general and the office of professional accountability.",69,,
345,0.97,2830.961,2838.735,I think the CPC stands out in comparison with them in supporting the rights of peaceful protest movements do not have to face constant police brutality.,69,,
346,0.97,2838.802,2859.856,"I will just say, I have said this before, I have joined any others in the movement in believing that we need a fully fledged electric community oversight board with full powers of the police, including hiring and firing.",69,,
347,0.97,2859.923,2864.328,I want to clarify that we are calling for that because we feel that is actually what will make a huge difference.,69,,
348,0.97,2864.394,2871.034,We will keep fighting for . This is not in any way attended as a commentary on the work of the members of the CPC and the overall work of the CPC.,69,,
349,0.97,2871.101,2875.906,It has been very much appreciated and I would encourage them to keep going . Thank you.,69,,
350,0.97,2875.973,2882.412,"Thank you, Sawant.",70,,
351,0.97,2882.479,2915.112,I also wanted to mention my thanks to the CPC for inclusion of NEWELL Aldrich from my office and their efforts to recruit additional members to serve on the CPC and inclusion of new NEWELL in the interviews to ensure that CBC has full membership.,70,,
352,0.97,2915.178,2944.775,"The standard that members of this particular Commission have to meet in many ways are higher than many of, any examples of Volunteerism and civic duty . We need candidates to find the time that the CPC does to fulfill its mission.",70,,
353,0.97,2944.841,2972.536,"I think CPC members again who are fulfilling this mission and spending that time . again, thank you to the CPC for your work not just on the policy side, but also in recruiting future leaders in this effort . with that, I move items one through six for a vote.",70,,
354,0.97,2972.602,2982.346,"That's 1753, 1754, 1755, 1756, 1758, and 1759.",70,,

369,0.97,3049.98,3053.417,And curry?,83,,
370,0.97,3053.483,3063.894,"Hello, curry Mayor.",84,,
371,0.97,3068.398,3084.181,"We will have the Mayor introduce and sing the praises of director Mayer . We are not voting in today's meeting, but we hope to do so at our next meeting on January 26.",85,,
372,0.97,3084.247,3097.494,"As far as our process goes, the Council will be collecting some questions to send for the director's response later on this week.",85,,
373,0.97,3097.561,3109.673,We want to have this opportunity to hear from deputy Mayor Fong about why they are recommending that we confirm director Mayer.,85,,
374,0.97,3109.739,3118.682,We would love to have this opportunity to hear from director Mayer as well to hear why she is interested in fulfilling this role.,85,,

376,0.97,3123.587,3137.534,"This is agenda item number seven, appointment 01757, appointment of curry Mayer, director of the office of emergency management.",86,,
377,0.97,3137.601,3148.311,"It is my of the Mayor to present to you the executives nominee for the next director for the office of emergency management, curry Mayer.",87,,
378,0.97,3148.378,3160.257,"She has over 20 years of experience in emergency management, both in the state of California, Washington, D.C., as well as here in our own state of Washington.",87,,
379,0.97,3160.323,3169.766,She has an extensive amount of experience around planning and emergency operations center response efforts.,87,,
380,0.97,3169.833,3202.399,"Her most recent role was as the emergency management, manager for the city of Bellevue . just as a side note, the city of Seattle has had a criminal track record with regard to recruiting emergency managers from our friends from across the Lake, as we had multiple people from the city of Bellevue.",87,,
381,0.97,3202.465,3208.004,We are really excited to have curry join our team.,87,,
382,0.97,3208.071,3244.574,"She really understands all functions and responsibilities related to emergency management . Following up on her extensive national search during a very challenging year in 2020, we are very fortunate to have actually found what we believe is the most qualified and experienced emergency manager in our own backyard to become the next director of OEM . Curry is the Star of the day, if you will.",87,,
383,0.97,3244.641,3252.882,I will end my comments here . I will give director Mayer the opportunity to really introduce yourself to you.,87,,
384,0.97,3252.949,3279.109,"We look forward to facilitating the process of the Council with regards to questions from you, the team, and any members of the public as we hopefully get director Mayer confirmed in short order . with that, chair Herbold, I will turn it over to you.",87,,
385,0.97,3279.175,3280.11,"Thank you, deputy Fong.",88,,
386,0.97,3280.176,3282.078,We appreciate you joining us this morning.,88,,
387,0.97,3282.145,3305.935,"We just want to hear informally from director Mayer and just here a little bit about why you want this job, which you hope to accomplish, and how your experience in Bellevue prepared you for this job and anything else you think we need to know.",88,,
388,0.97,3306.002,3306.569,"Okay, great.",89,,
389,0.97,3306.636,3306.936,Thank you.,89,,
390,0.97,3307.003,3316.88,"Thank you Council members for spending time with me today . I would also like to thank Mayor Durkan for the opportunity to serve Seattle . I am really honored to be here, one of the great cities of the world.",89,,
391,0.97,3316.946,3338.835,"Thank you, deputy Mayor Fong . I would like to thank deputy director Laurel Nelson and the talented OEM team that has already provided me with a great deal of support.",89,,
392,0.97,3338.902,3341.871,"As deputy Mayor Fong mentioned, I have been in this field for quite some time.",89,,
393,0.97,3341.938,3349.612,"I am very passionate not only about emergency management, but having a positive impact on the community and for helping people.",89,,
394,0.97,3349.679,3354.651,There are many components necessary for emergency management to be successful . I really believe that Seattle has those.,89,,
395,0.97,3354.718,3385.348,"So a commitment to racial and social justice, values of inclusion, learning, accountability and stewardship, a talented and committed Oam staff, and also the belief that government works best when it works Collaboratively with the community that it serves . So this means also not only that you are a good listener, that you have both diversity of thought that is valued and encouraged, and diversity of voices.",89,,
396,0.97,3385.415,3400.964,Seattle is one of the great cities of the world and it is known for being innovative . It is really exciting to have the opportunity to serve in that way.,89,,
397,0.97,3401.03,3418.014,"I also believe that my skills and experience working with many different organizations outside of government and public safety has allowed me to really learn how to listen to what a group values and needs and then connect that to emergency management principles, which is really about building community resilience.",89,,
398,0.97,3418.081,3423.987,So I really believe that emergency management is connected to everything.,89,,
399,0.97,3424.053,3448.311,"It is our job in the emergency management profession to explain to people what that means and how not only can we help them during times of disaster or some other kind of impact to their daily lives, but what that means and how they can be involved in that . that also means meeting people where they are.",89,,
400,0.97,3448.378,3467.23,"So understanding how social justice issues, poverty, limited English skills, or anything else that causes people to have access and functional needs, what is it they require in order to even be aware of what the hazards may be in their community?",89,,
401,0.97,3467.297,3475.705,"And then from that awareness, how do they get resources? How do they build resilience? and why should they trust those of us in government to be able to help them?",89,,
402,0.97,3475.772,3483.646,"I believe that community preparedness is really the way to go, rather than individual preparedness.",89,,
403,0.97,3483.713,3505.869,"I also am a fan of using what we call culture brokers to bridge the communication for those who don't trust government and looking to community leaders to have strong partnerships with us, strong regional partnerships being also important.",89,,
404,0.97,3505.935,3530.593,"I spend a lot of time in Bellevue being a part of a number of regional committees . I work with Washington 2-On-1 board,--211 board, which ties people to resources and does Full-Circle engagement with people who call and need resources.",89,,
405,0.97,3530.66,3542.038,I am also with the center of excellence for community management.,89,,
406,0.97,3542.105,3569.565,"It works with all the technical colleges in the state of Washington not only to get people Nterested in the emergency management profession, but to really help and support a strong employment for all of Washington Tony Evans--all Washingtonians . So through that community college network, we work with the public sector, the private sector, and students to really help them be engaged and be employed in a number of different ways.",89,,
407,0.97,3569.632,3604.3,"I have worked a lot with King County on the emergency management advisory Council, which is a body that advises the King County counsel on issues that face our County . I also am chair of the critical infrastructure Workgroup, a Public-Private partnership relationship that works on all those things that might impact critical infrastructure across county lines, so not just in the county, but with our neighbors as well.",89,,
408,0.97,3604.367,3619.782,"Also in Bellevue, I worked really closely with the Transportation Department doing training and exercises for debris management plan and engagement with other city departments on how we would make that a reality.",89,,
409,0.97,3619.849,3621.784,That was the first time that had ever been done.,89,,
410,0.97,3621.851,3629.625,"I led the effort of the city on Covid response, which like in Seattle, was a citywide engagement.",89,,
411,0.97,3629.692,3633.096,We spend a lot of time on our continuity of operations Annexes and making those a reality.,89,,
412,0.97,3633.162,3670.7,"This was our test on how we did when we put those together and how we continue to work together across departments . So I believe that that experience, my experience in California, and the work that I have done with the academic world has really prepared me to be a strong leader in Seattle, not just in Emergenc management, but as a coordinator and kind of the glue between departments for how we continue to build community resilience.",89,,
413,0.97,3670.767,3672.802,"So again, I would like to thank you for your time.",89,,
414,0.97,3672.869,3680.209,I think you for the nomination and for the engagement with you.,89,,
415,0.97,3680.276,3681.711,I am happy to answer questions.,89,,
416,0.97,3681.778,3686.349,Thank you so Mayer.,90,,
417,0.97,3686.416,3708.504,I just want to take a moment to comment that it takes a special type of person in the middle of a public emergency to move to one medium-sized city to a larger city while we are still in the middle of a public emergency.,90,,
418,0.97,3708.571,3722.518,"I really appreciate your willingness to serve us here in Seattle, taking over from the amazing work that the interim director has been doing over the last several months.",90,,
419,0.97,3722.585,3750.947,"There will be an opportunity for more of, I say with humor, Grilling at our next meeting . I just want to give my colleagues an opportunity to weigh in or welcome you . If anybody has something they would like to contribute at this point, they can say it now.",90,,
420,0.97,3751.013,3752.381,"Otherwise, we will see you on the 26th.",90,,
421,0.97,3752.448,3753.85,Thank you so much.,91,,
422,0.97,3753.916,3756.886,Just one comment.,92,,
423,0.97,3756.953,3768.798,"I did want to take the opportunity to also join you in thinking Laurel Nelson, our interim director.",92,,
424,0.97,3768.865,3778.374,We had a well-deserved retirement timed right when the pandemic hit our region aggressively.,92,,
425,0.97,3778.441,3783.146,But Laurel Nelson has done an incredible job holding things down for the better part of 2020.,92,,
426,0.97,3783.212,3789.919,I want to make sure on the record the executive takes the opportunity.,92,,
427,0.97,3789.986,3792.355,"Thank you, deputy",93,,
428,0.97,3792.421,3793.756,Much agreed.,94,,
429,0.97,3793.823,3796.692,All right.,94,,
430,0.97,3796.759,3800.563,Thank you again.,94,,
431,0.97,3800.63,3808.871,We will see you on the 26th.,94,,
432,0.97,3808.938,3810.907,Thank you for your time.,95,,
433,0.97,3810.973,3811.507,I so appreciated.,95,,
434,0.97,3811.574,3813.543,I am truly honored to be here . Thank you.,95,,
435,0.97,3813.609,3813.943,Thank you.,96,,
436,0.97,3814.01,3816.779,I see that Councilmember Gonzalez has joined us.,96,,
437,0.97,3816.846,3820.583,Thank you for being here with us today.,96,,
438,0.97,3820.65,3831.594,Will Clark the agenda item number eight?,97,,
439,0.97,3831.661,3841.971,"It is the decision unless the full recommendations of the community police Commission, office of Inspector general, and office of police accountability.",98,,
440,0.97,3842.038,3842.972,"Thank you, Alex.",99,,
441,0.97,3843.039,3861.791,This is the third in a series of meetings that this committee has held sense counsel adopted ordinance 126102 in response to the murder of George Floyd and a heavy use of crowd control weapons by the Seattle police Department.,99,,
442,0.97,3861.857,3867.129,Ordinance 126102 prohibits the use of numerous less lethal weapons.,99,,
443,0.97,3867.196,3931.527,"I want to state at the outset that I agree that our goal is to have the strongest possible ordinance . that I believe is the framework that we on this committee are operating under . We share the goal to regulate the use of less lethal weapons, particularly less lethal weapons that are being used in crowd control situations . But there are some important contexts to understand as it relates to achieving that goal . after the city submitted the ordinance to the court as provided by the ordinance itself and required by the consent decree, we had to submit the ordinance to the court for the review of the court as well as the review of the monitor . in July, U.S. District Court Judge Robillard issued a temporary restraining order on the ordinance.",99,,
444,0.97,3931.594,3938.467,"It prohibited--I am sorry, the order prohibited the ordinance itself from going into effect.",99,,
445,0.97,3938.534,3943.639,"In August, the three accountability bodies completed recommendations relating to the ban in the ordinance.",99,,
446,0.97,3943.706,3955.384,"Again, both the Council and the court requested the recommendations of the three accountability bodies.",99,,
447,0.97,3955.451,3988.451,"The Council requested it within the ordinance itself and the court requested it as part of the consent decree review that we are required in the city of Seattle to go through for all ordinances of these types . on September 11, at the public safety and human services committee meeting, the police Commission and the office of police accountability each presented their recommendations, the same recommendations we received back in August.",99,,
448,0.97,3988.517,4011.374,"On December 17, we had a second round table discussion with the accountability bodies and the Seattle police Department about the content of the recommendations . today, we are considering new draft legislation that reflects first the consensus items from the accountability bodies, and a decision agenda for all other items where there is no consensus from the accountability bodies.",99,,
449,0.97,4011.44,4032.695,"So again, there is a bill that we are using as sort of our base bill that reflects the items where everybody agrees . that is the CPC, the OPA, and the Oig.",99,,
450,0.97,4032.762,4040.803,Then we will have a discussion and give indication about our preference on the items for regulation there is not full agreement on.,99,,
451,0.97,4040.87,4043.272,The committee may vote on legislation at our next meeting on the 26th.,99,,
452,0.97,4043.339,4059.955,"And then after the committee vote, but before full council action, the legislation will have to be sent to the monitor, the Department of justice, and judge Robart in line with the requirements under the consent decree process.",99,,
453,0.97,4060.022,4069.865,This has to happen before any consideration at full council if we want to be ultimately voting on a bill that withstands scrutiny of the court.,99,,
454,0.97,4069.932,4078.24,"Again, there is no city law currently in effect limiting use of less lethal or crowd control weapons.",99,,
455,0.97,4078.307,4090.786,There will not be one without the successful completion of the consent decree review process related to this legislation.,99,,
456,0.97,4090.853,4094.49,"There are current partial limitations as a result of the black lives matter, ACLU lawsuit.",99,,
457,0.97,4094.557,4109.705,"Again, those partial limitations are the result of a lawsuit and a court order . They are not meeting our goals and counsel to have policy that is reflected in the Seattle municipal code.",99,,
458,0.97,4109.772,4131.193,"Under the consent decree, Judge Robart has the final say . It is worth us looking at the clues he has provided as a regards the ordinance.",99,,
459,0.97,4131.26,4144.707,So the judge in the June temporary restraining order said that he was critical of the ordinance adopted by the Council.,99,,
460,0.97,4144.773,4156.018,He was concerned that it did not increase public safety as it was written.,99,,
461,0.97,4156.085,4160.456,"He has also expressed interest in hearing from the three accountability bodies, as the Council did as well in its ordinance.",99,,
462,0.97,4160.523,4172.635,"That is the key reason that the committee has met twice since that time to hear, discuss, and ask questions about the accountability recommendations and why the discussion is structured wholly around their recommendations.",99,,
463,0.97,4172.701,4181.577,"The judge is a person who must authorize any bill, and unlike a mayoral veto, the Council cannot override the judge's rulings.",99,,
464,0.97,4181.644,4211.407,"The normal powers of the Council to enact legislation under the city charter do not apply as they normally do because of the did consent decree but if the court does not authorize the ordinance that the Council passes to go into effect, we will be in the same position that we are in now, without any lawn effect . I just want Councilmembers to know that we do have representatives of the CPC, the Oig, and the OPA present in case Councilmembers have questions.",99,,
465,0.97,4211.473,4242.471,"We have the OPA director, the deputy Inspector General from the Oig, and someone from the community police Commission . But we are going to do is were going to turn it over to central staff to start the presentation.",99,,
466,0.97,4245.174,4248.477,We will go through an overview of the oversight agencies and briefly talk about the base bill.,99,,
467,0.97,4248.544,4268.564,Then we will walk through some policy items to further amend the base bill . My hope is that Councilmembers with us today can express their policy preferences for options that will be contained.,99,,
468,0.97,4268.631,4284.813,"The options are drafted around different, less lethal weapons . There are slightly different options for each of the types of less lethal weapons.",99,,
469,0.97,4284.88,4314.309,"My hope is that, again, that Councilmembers express their policy preference and that central staff can use that information to develop another base bill that we will then again come back on the 26th to discuss and hopefully move out of committee as our committee recommendation that will again go to the judge.",99,,
470,0.97,4324.753,4326.422,Are now handed over to lise Kaye.,99,,
471,0.97,4326.488,4367.496,"I am lise Kaye and partner, Greg Doss, has agreed to move the Slideshow for me . I will wait until she can pulls up and share the screen . So we can move to slide two, Greg, at your convenience . committee members saw this chart at your December 17 meeting.",100,,
472,0.97,4367.563,4375.204,It shows how each accountability agency would change the ban enacted in ordinance 12610243 categories of use.,100,,
473,0.97,4375.27,4407.703,-- 126102 23 categories of use . will were calling the base bill for discussion would ban the use of tear gas by patrol officers.,100,,
474,0.97,4407.77,4412.174,"So that is the starting point . It's go to slide three, please, Greg.",100,,
475,0.97,4412.241,4430.058,"For this draft base bill, which as chair Herbold said, is just the starting point for this discussion, building on those four areas of consensus.",100,,
476,0.97,4430.125,4441.036,"If this bill were adopted as drafted, it would differ from the crawl control bill in four ways.",100,,
477,0.97,4441.103,4443.806,Use the term less lethal weapons instead of crowd control weapons.,100,,
478,0.97,4443.872,4459.521,"As with the original ban, the legislation would still apply only to those Advices designed to be used on multiple individuals to crowd control . This is important, because not all less lethal weapons would fit this definition.",100,,
479,0.97,4459.588,4462.457,"For example, a Taser is not designed to be used on multiple individuals.",100,,
480,0.97,4462.524,4469.631,So it would not be legislated or regulated by this legislation.,100,,
481,0.97,4469.698,4483.278,The second area would include updated recitals to include court rulings and would include the four areas of consensus in the accountability partners report.,100,,
482,0.97,4483.345,4495.457,The new bill would maintain a ban on the use of 40 millimeter launchers and flash diversion devices for crowd dispersal purposes.,100,,
483,0.97,4495.524,4496.725,But it would allow patrol and S.W.A.T.,100,,
484,0.97,4496.792,4498.861,Officers to use them for Non- crime control purposes.,100,,
485,0.97,4498.927,4521.35,-- Non-Crowd control purposes . The third is that it would allow pepper spray to be used for Non-Crowd control purposes . The original bill had a exception that allowed officers to use pepper spray as long as a did not Lanae more than one individual.,100,,
486,0.97,4521.416,4530.626,"The revised bill is just broader than that, allowing less specific than that, but still allows patrol officers to use pepper spray.",100,,
487,0.97,4530.692,4537.499,I would note with some emphasis that law is still reviewing this base bill.,100,,
488,0.97,4537.566,4570.532,"This should definitely be considered a preliminary draft . Let's go on to slide four . As chair Herbold mentioned, we would like the feedback of the Committee on the policy discussions regarding each of the five less lethal weapons Addresse in the draft bill . for each of these, you will see at least three primary options and in some cases a fourth option.",100,,
489,0.97,4570.599,4591.853,"These would be to affirm the ban on the use of the device, exempt the device from the ban, or exempt the device from the ban with specific policy conditions, which would be either written into the legislation or drafted by the police Department with the approval of the court.",100,,
490,0.97,4596.525,4601.496,"Again, for any exemptions with conditions, so if you chose this third option, the committee does not need to finalize any desired conditions today.",100,,
491,0.97,4601.563,4608.57,The chair is hoping the committee can determine whether the policy condition should be included in the ordinance or left for Seattle police Department to develop in conjunction with the accountability agencies and the court.,100,,
492,0.97,4608.637,4610.272,"Thank you, that particular point.",101,,
493,0.97,4610.339,4628.523,I just want to underscore it . I don't think we are going to have the time to get into the universe of conditions that we might want to apply.,101,,
494,0.97,4628.59,4636.031,Were not going to be able to talk about all the different kinds of conditions that we might want to apply.,101,,
495,0.97,4636.098,4637.032,I welcome conversation about it.,101,,
496,0.97,4637.099,4646.141,But I just don't want Councilmembers to feel pressured to identify what all of those might be in this meeting.,101,,
497,0.97,4646.208,4648.477,We will have that discussion more in depth at our next meeting.,101,,
498,0.97,4648.543,4672.567,"As Lisa stated, would be great to hear from folks whether or not they think conditions should be included in the ordinance or whether or not we should direct the police Department to develop policies for those conditions and of course those policies of the the police Department will have to go through the consent decree process.",101,,
499,0.97,4672.634,4677.906,"Madam chair, should ahead and move on to the specific policy options at this point?",102,,
500,0.97,4677.973,4680.275,Councilmember Sawant?,103,,
501,0.97,4680.342,4681.91,"Thank you, Herbold.",104,,
502,0.97,4681.977,4710.672,"I just wanted to make a few general points before we go into the specifics, but I just wanted to say, as the people watching this will recall, the ban on crowd control weapons was won by the movement last June during the height of the street protests.",104,,
503,0.97,4710.739,4721.55,It was put forward by the office alongside the movement . I wanted to make some remarks related to that and when I think about the overall framework here . This was a crucial victory for the black lives matter movement.,104,,
504,0.97,4721.616,4752.28,"As many have said before me, the events of last Wednesday, which I know most of the Councilmembers have already spoken to this and we are in agreement about this, it was really ominous what we are seeing from the far right . What is also ominous alongside that is that the far right mob was greeted with kid gloves, whereas consistently, almost overwhelmingly, unanimously we have seen his weapons being deployed against left wing protests.",104,,
505,0.97,4752.347,4758.32,That is why it is really crucial to not have any weakening of the ban.,104,,
506,0.97,4758.386,4775.837,"I appreciate Councilmember Herbold pointing out that obviously, because the city is under the consent agreement, we need to go through that process.",104,,
507,0.97,4775.904,4780.442,I want to clarify that we are not trying to pretend that we exist in the universe that does not have that process.,104,,
508,0.97,4780.509,4808.303,"As I said yesterday, I feel quite concerned that in reality the apparatus of the city, Mayor Durkan, the police chief, former police chief best, at that time writer--right after we had passed this unanimously, they used the procedural step of notifying the Federal Court overseeing the consent degree--consent decree.",104,,
509,0.97,4808.37,4812.374,They were trying to use it as an opportunity to derail the ban and stop it from being implemented.,104,,
510,0.97,4812.44,4831.626,"That was acknowledged by Judge Robart at that time, who refused to grant what they were asking between the lines, which is temporary restraining order on this ordinance . and then of course, he later on, as you mentioned, he did grant that . But that was in response to a request from Trump'S Department of justice.",104,,
511,0.97,4831.693,4835.697,That was joined by the city attorney.,104,,
512,0.97,4835.764,4846.708,"That is what concerns me . I cannot think of another time when the city has gone to court to block the implementation of legislation that was passed, much less unanimously, by the highest legislative body of the city.",104,,
513,0.97,4846.775,4868.597,"Wild Donald Trump's Department of justice and Jenny Durkan's police Department are superficially the two sites of this, they are in total agreement on this point and on the repression of protests . There was nobody in the court representing the protesters and ordinary people who don't want these weapons deployed.",104,,
514,0.97,4868.663,4885.981,"By contrast, when a different federal judge placed a different injunction on the police Department temporarily banning their use of tear gas, and this was mentioned before, the police violated that injunction and the city unsuccessfully went to court to fight to have that injunction lifted.",104,,
515,0.97,4886.047,4901.329,And so I think it is important that we pass legislation that does not have any loopholes . I will happily support any legislation around any amendment to support ending that injunction so the bill can go into effect.,104,,
516,0.97,4901.396,4934.929,"I don't want to see is loopholes, and we will have that discussion, so we will see where the Councilmembers stand, but it is important that we don't create giant loopholes . I will acknowledge that the memo that chair Herbold circulated and also last night, her office circulated, the baseline legislation with I appreciate, but there are also options that Lisa will go through now that will create that opportunity.",104,,
517,0.97,4934.996,4954.082,"I would urge Councilmembers that given the clear track record of police departments targeting progressive and Left- wing movements with violence and using kid gloves in response to far right Mobbs, that we hold the line and really support the principal and past the strongest possible legislation.",104,,
518,0.97,4954.149,4961.923,Thank you.,104,,
519,0.97,4961.99,4973.935,"You reminded me important piece of context that I want to remind everybody and make sure that the public understands, as well.",105,,
520,0.97,4974.002,4991.82,"Under the consent decree, the Seattle police Department is required to regularly review its internal policies and procedures.",105,,
521,0.97,4995.256,5046.741,"They are reviewing them in regards to crowd control management as well as regards to less lethal weapons options . As part of their review of those policies, their recommendations for changes to those policies will also go through the consent decree process, just like our legislation has to go through the consent decree process . subject to the review of the monitor and judge Robart . I think one of my goals is not consent decree review process strong legislation, but to make sure that we have a bill that the consent decree process can review alongside the recommendations, the recommendations that the SPD is making for review of its policies.",105,,
522,0.97,5046.808,5092.02,I am very concerned that we could get into a situation where the court and the monitor are only reviewing the recommendations of the police Department . that is one reason why it is so important that we work with the city attorney on ensuring that the Timeframe for the police Department review and submission of their policies happens in a way that allows the Council to act so that the judge understands both what the policy preferences of the Council are as well as the preferences of the police Department.,105,,
523,0.97,5092.086,5113.374,I don't want a situation where we have the consent decree review process or the police Department recommended changes to be happening in a vacuum without the recommendations of the Council changes to the legislation.,105,,
524,0.97,5113.441,5125.553,There are no questions for my colleagues . Let's move on to the policy options for each of the less lethal weapons.,105,,
525,0.97,5125.62,5134.729,"Thank you, Madam so we are starting with blast balls.",106,,
526,0.97,5134.796,5138.166,I will give a brief reminder prior to each of these about what these devices do.,106,,
527,0.97,5138.233,5141.803,"You are all intimately familiar with this, I am sure.",106,,
528,0.97,5141.87,5159.854,"Glass balls are round, rubber devices designed to create diversionary light and sound . They only use these balls that produce light and sound in powder or a small amount of pepper spray.",106,,
529,0.97,5159.921,5167.529,The draft ordinance that is the base bill does not make any changes to this span or to the ban that was in the ordinance 126102.,106,,
530,0.97,5167.595,5202.53,"There was not consensus among the accountability agencies on whether or not to use these . given that, the committee's options are to retain the total two--the total ban; option two, which would specify exceptions to the ban; and option three, which would specify exceptions to the ban subject to at a conditions that would then be specified either in legislation or drafted by the Seattle police Department with court approval.",106,,
531,0.97,5202.597,5216.144,"I will turn that back to you, Madam chair, for a discussion on blast balls.",106,,
532,0.97,5216.21,5222.684,I am looking to or not folks have any comments on this.,107,,
533,0.97,5222.75,5253.014,"Want to see if folks have any comments in this particular less lethal force weapon . just a few background comments as it relates to the history of the use of blast balls . I want to remind folks that in 2016, the community police Commission bald--called for the police",107,,
534,0.97,5253.081,5261.255,Ommission balls after injuries were reported to protesters and reporters.,108,,
535,0.97,5261.322,5268.763,The CPC continues to recommend a complete ban.,108,,
536,0.97,5268.83,5289.283,"The other two agencies are not recommending a complete ban . back in 2016, the CPC set until such time as blast balls propensity for causing injury, including specific evidence from the past two years in Seattle and their appropriate use giving that risk have been publicly weighed, we ask that the Seattle police Department suspended their use.",108,,
537,0.97,5289.35,5303.064,"This is what they said in 2016. in June of last year, a Protester was nearly killed after use of a blast all . Despite training, indiscriminate use and consistent with training continues.",108,,
538,0.97,5303.131,5307.135,-- inconsistent with training continues.,108,,
539,0.97,5307.201,5374.836,"The CPC recommends that the ban allows for use of appropriate less lethal options, that the ban should allow for use of appropriate less lethal options with strong policies and accountability mechanisms outside of crowd control . The CPC still believes that we should allow for the full ban of blast balls and tear gas . There is also an old report from, I want to say it was around 2017, Councilmember Gonzalez might remember better than I, one of the action steps relates to the use of blast balls . absent clearly articulated circumstances, they should not be deployed.",108,,
540,0.97,5374.902,5381.309,"Historically, there have been dramatic deviations from the norm.",108,,
541,0.97,5381.375,5407.502,"Again, there have been long- standing expectations that the Seattle police Department make changes to their application and use of blast balls that, from my perspective, they are not fulfilling set expectations.",108,,
542,0.97,5407.568,5424.085,"I am inclined to support the policy option that is identified as option one, retaining the total ban for ordinance 126102.",108,,
543,0.97,5424.152,5434.295,Chair?,109,,
544,0.97,5434.362,5434.729,"Yes, please.",110,,
545,0.97,5434.796,5435.296,Thank you.,110,,
546,0.97,5435.363,5436.13,Are you calling on me?,110,,
547,0.97,5436.197,5437.365,I am calling on you.,111,,
548,0.97,5437.431,5437.765,Okay.,112,,
549,0.97,5437.832,5441.435,I had to look at to actually see what is going on on my screen.,113,,
550,0.97,5441.502,5443.004,Feel free to speak up.,113,,
551,0.97,5443.07,5444.872,Okay.,114,,
552,0.97,5444.939,5450.745,So I am inclined to agree with you.,114,,
553,0.97,5450.812,5484.478,"Particularly after all of the Video footage that we saw over the summer where these devices that are supposed to be rolled into a crowd are actually being thrown overhead and being used in a way that apparently seems to be targeting individual members and causing injury, I do think there has been repeated attempts and requests for better training and review on how these devices are being used and also repeated disregard for that.",114,,
554,0.97,5484.545,5492.186,"At this point, I am inclined to agree with you that we should just continue the ban on these that is included in the ordinance.",114,,
555,0.97,5492.253,5499.093,Thank you.,115,,
556,0.97,5499.16,5504.999,I appreciate you speaking up here.,115,,
557,0.97,5505.066,5505.6,Anybody else?,115,,
558,0.97,5505.666,5506.367,Councilmember Sawant?,115,,
559,0.97,5506.434,5511.072,I was using the hand feature.,116,,
560,0.97,5511.138,5515.743,I think Councilmember Gonzalez was before me.,117,,
561,0.97,5515.81,5517.912,I will let her go first.,117,,
562,0.97,5517.979,5520.915,"Okay, go ahead.",118,,
563,0.97,5520.982,5527.922,"Does not make to me whether I go before or after you, Councilmember Sawant.",119,,
564,0.97,5527.989,5554.148,"I am also inclined to support option one, which is retaining the total ban on the use of blast balls per the ordinance that we previously considered for all of the reasons that you have stated, chair Herbold, but also for the reasons that Councilmember Morales just stated, as well.",119,,
565,0.97,5554.215,5580.942,"I will just note that in addition to that, in early December, the issue of the use of blast balls was considered by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Jones, who issued a 27 page order in response to a motion by black lives matter King county in which there was a request to find the police in content of an injunction that was issued earlier.",119,,
566,0.97,5581.008,5615.676,"I take to heart and very seriously that the court in that particular case, and again this is as early as just about a month ago, that the court mentioned in the order that, of all of the less lethal weapons used, the court was most concerned with the use of blast balls, which the court order described as being the most indiscriminate of the four crowd control weapons that he was asked to examine.",119,,
567,0.97,5615.743,5662.223,"I do think that there is unfortunately a pretty consistent track record of misuse of blast balls in spite of a significant amount of training in this space and in spite of the independent consultant that was hired to evaluate the use of blast balls by SPD after, I believe it was in 2015 or 2016 when there was significant concerns of blast balls injuring journalists as well as protesters because of their indiscriminate nature once deployed.",119,,
568,0.97,5662.289,5701.228,"It is important for us to take in consideration, as long as we are looking at losing cues--clues and cues that were getting, it is important to keep in mind the court order that was issued in December by Judge Jones, who did not mince words about how blast balls are very indiscriminate and create a significant amount of harm to protesters.",119,,
569,0.97,5701.295,5711.005,"So I think given that order and the other reasons that have been stated on the record, I would very much be in favor of option one.",119,,
570,0.97,5711.072,5712.273,"Thank you, chair.",119,,
571,0.97,5712.339,5717.645,Thank you.,120,,
572,0.97,5717.711,5723.35,Just checking to see if anybody else has a raised hand.,120,,
573,0.97,5723.417,5726.754,Can I go?,121,,
574,0.97,5726.821,5728.422,Sorry.,122,,
575,0.97,5728.489,5729.623,"Councilmember Sawant, go ahead.",122,,
576,0.97,5729.69,5731.625,Thank you.,123,,
577,0.97,5731.692,5750.978,"Of course, the ban on, a total ban on glad blast balls was part of the legislation that my office had Re-Sponsored in June, which was unanimously adopted.",123,,
578,0.97,5751.045,5754.148,"Needless to say, I maintain support of a total ban on blast balls.",123,,
579,0.97,5754.215,5761.288,I also commend the statements on the three Councilmembers who have maintained their support on the total ban.,123,,
580,0.97,5761.355,5765.86,I would welcome other Councilmembers to adopt that position.,123,,
581,0.97,5765.926,5778.606,"We heard from many people in public comment, in letters, but there are also Statistics that show how people are injured, sometimes previously, by blast balls during protests.",123,,
582,0.97,5778.672,5795.456,"It also points towards why, when we formed the original legislation, we did not use the term less lethal weapons . Yes, it is technically true that these are less lethal than bullets that could take in life.",123,,
583,0.97,5795.523,5804.865,"But it is not less lethal than, for example, not having a blast ball or projectile thrown at you.",123,,
584,0.97,5804.932,5845.839,"They can be quite injurious . I think the community police Commission for not only supporting the total ban now, but as Councilmember Herbold mentioned, the CPC has spoken about this publicly and sent letters to the police Department sensed 2015, 2016. I would also mention that the fact that it has now been four or five years where it has not only been the position of the CPC, but the data collected over that time shows how harmful these weapons are, that the police Department continues to use it.",123,,
585,0.97,5845.906,5869.93,"This also points towards how, in addition to upholding a very strong ban on these weapons coming out of this Committee, we also need to have an elected civilian oversight board . There is really no enforcement, not no enforcement, but little enforcement happening over the use of these weapons by the police Department.",123,,
586,0.97,5869.997,5873.934,"Thank you, Sawant.",124,,
587,0.97,5874.001,5880.507,"Madam chair, I have comments as well if this would be the appropriate time.",125,,
588,0.97,5880.574,5882.576,Certainly.,126,,
589,0.97,5882.643,5889.049,"Most of my points already been covered, particularly by Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Gonzalez.",127,,
590,0.97,5889.116,5907.001,I will say that I would actually have a very hard time voting for an alternate ordinance unless there was a complete ban on blast balls . I agree with the consensus that has emerged here.,127,,
591,0.97,5907.067,5934.962,"I do just want to say that following Councilmember Gonzalez'S comments regarding the finding from judge Jones, which I think is particularly instructive here, I cannot imagine more notice for the police Department to be under regarding the appropriate and proper deployment per policy of these weapons.",127,,
592,0.97,5935.029,5951.045,We still had officers throwing these things overhand when it had at been eminently and stated that this is a departure from stated policy.,127,,
593,0.97,5951.111,5970.297,"As late as late August, there were still instances recorded and are a matter of a contempt finding against the city of officers throwing these weapons overhand in a way that most generously could be described as indiscriminate and most ominously could be described as a specific targeting of individuals.",127,,
594,0.97,5970.364,5999.426,"Given that, I just don't see how supplemental efforts to enforce, to train, to guide policy are going to be more efficacious than the efforts by the Federal courts and the city to rein in this use over the summer that has still resulted in misuse of these weapons . for that reason, I do support retaining the total ban on the blast balls.",127,,
595,0.97,5999.493,6007.334,"Thank you, Lewis.",128,,
596,0.97,6007.401,6009.937,"All right, let's move to the next slide.",128,,
597,0.97,6010.003,6019.012,I believe that is 48 millimeter launchers.,128,,
598,0.97,6019.079,6030.491,"I want to clarify that for the purposes of this discussion, we are talking about not the launcher itself, but how it is used and what is in it.",128,,
599,0.97,6030.557,6036.764,And we are talking about its use to launch OC spray.,128,,
600,0.97,6036.83,6038.232,There are two types of launchers.,128,,
601,0.97,6038.298,6043.47,One is a single use launcher and the other multi use launcher.,128,,
602,0.97,6043.537,6067.661,"I would like it if we could focus our discussion today on not the equipment itself, but how it is used to deploy dangerous chemical irritants in a way that is indiscriminate.",128,,
603,0.97,6068.162,6070.731,"Thank you, Madam you have slide six in front of you there.",129,,
604,0.97,6070.798,6074.067,"This is 40 millimeter launchers, as chair Herbold mentioned.",129,,
605,0.97,6074.134,6081.041,These can be used to fire sponge rounds and other projectiles.,129,,
606,0.97,6081.108,6083.61,The sponge rounds may or may not be infused with pepper spray.,129,,
607,0.97,6083.677,6094.488,"As the council member mentioned, there are single and Multiuse applications with different distances that can be achieved by the different types of launcher.",129,,
608,0.97,6094.555,6107.234,"The draft ordinance reflects the consensus that these launchers should be banned for use for crowd dispersal, but available for S.W.A.T.",129,,
609,0.97,6107.301,6128.422,"And patrol officers to use in Non-Crowd control situations . your policy options, you will hear these all the way through these presentations, but option one is to retain the total ban, option two would reflect the consensus position in the base bill, which is to accrue exemptions to the ban for patrol and S.W.A.T.",129,,
610,0.97,6128.489,6137.397,"Option three would approve exemptions the bill for patrol and S.W.A.T., but also specify exemptions for crowd control situations.",129,,
611,0.97,6137.464,6153.146,"Option four would be, if there were those additional exceptions added, you would make those subject to conditions either in legislation or as drafted by the Seattle police Department with the approval of the court.",129,,
612,0.97,6153.213,6169.596,"On this, too, I slide, and I may have hurt you differently, but the consensus position is to ban for patrol and S.W.A.T.",130,,
613,0.97,6169.663,6171.865,", and that is what is reflected in the bill, correct?",130,,
614,0.97,6171.932,6183.277,The consensus position does not include banning in crowd control situations.,130,,
615,0.97,6183.343,6183.644,Correct.,131,,
616,0.97,6183.71,6184.244,All right.,132,,
617,0.97,6184.311,6186.48,Council to add one other thing.,133,,
618,0.97,6186.547,6219.179,"While for discussion purposes, there is a differentiation being made between patrol and S.W.A.T., the bill itself, the existing ordinance cannot make any existing differentiations . If we want to make any differentiations, that would need to be reported in the bill.",133,,
619,0.97,6219.246,6223.417,"Thank you, Greg.",134,,
620,0.97,6223.483,6254.348,"Think about putting a pin in that and returning to those definitions at a future meeting . again, the options are retaining the total ban as the ordinance requires, approving the base bill which only includes the consensus position of the ban for patrol in S.W.A.T.",134,,
621,0.97,6254.414,6277.304,"-- patrol and S.W.A.T., option three being approving the exemptions to the ban for patrol in S.W.A.T.",134,,
622,0.97,6281.041,6343.904,"And adding additional exemptions for crowd control . again, with this item, I am inclined to maintain the ban as proposed in ordinance 126102. again, the CPC recommends banning for crowd control . The OPA and Oig have not recommended banning this tool in crowd control situations . The bill as it is currently drafted represents a consensus to allow in Non-Crowd control situations--and again, as I mentioned, I want to focus on regulating how the launcher is used and what goes in it, what--not what type of launcher it is.",134,,
623,0.97,6343.97,6390.617,"In recognition that there is a consensus position that there be no ban for pepper spray in crowd control situations where it is traditionally employed, so that is not only the consensus position, but the position contained in ordinance 126102, what that means is if we look at maintaining the ban for crowd control situations of launching OC, the ordinance as drafted allows pepper spray to be deployed in crowd control situations with some defined conditions.",134,,
624,0.97,6390.684,6423.517,"And I think we can have another conversation about what those defined conditions might be . again, my inclination is to maintain the ban on deploying pepper spray by launcher . again, I think this is a harmful chemical irritant that, when deployed by launcher, is fairly indiscriminate.",134,,
625,0.97,6423.583,6462.289,"The deployment method makes it very hard to use in the method in which pepper spray was designed to be used, which is a fairly targeted fashion to not impact large numbers of people, but to focus on individuals who are engaged in illegal activity . So with that, I will get back my screen here.",134,,
626,0.97,6462.355,6473.867,I will see if my Council colleagues have any thoughts about that recommendation.,134,,
627,0.97,6473.934,6485.078,Councilmember happy to weigh in.,135,,
628,0.97,6485.145,6486.179,"Thank you, Gonzalez.",136,,
629,0.97,6486.246,6487.38,I appreciate your description here.,137,,
630,0.97,6487.447,6550.677,"I was looking at some of the court orders related to the launchers and saw that, in some instances, launchers were being used to--the thing they were launching was something other than a chemical irritant I am inclined to again support what is in the current base bill, option two, for the reasons that you described . But I am open to continuing to have conversations about how this Munition is used in crowd control settings . that could be a world in which we want to Revisit the base bill to be more restrictive, not just limiting its ban on appointment of chemical irritants, but also projectiles that could be very harmful.",137,,
631,0.97,6550.744,6565.292,And so I don't want to exclude the option to at least have a conversation about that.,137,,
632,0.97,6565.358,6567.127,I am not saying that is where I am it.,137,,
633,0.97,6567.193,6572.198,I am just lagging that I would be interested in learning more about this particular device and how it is deployed in these settings.,137,,
634,0.97,6572.265,6589.816,"But for now, based on the information I have, I am comfortable with moving forward with option two as sort of the baseline of where we will start the conversation, with the understanding that we may want to Revisit this as we get more information about how this Munition is deployed.",137,,
635,0.97,6589.883,6596.156,"Thank you, Gonzalez.",138,,
636,0.97,6596.222,6597.791,"Councilmember Morales, I think you had a question?",138,,
637,0.97,6597.857,6598.625,I do.,139,,
638,0.97,6598.692,6612.038,This is actually for the community police Commission . I will say that I have been thinking about this whole issue much differently in the last week.,139,,
639,0.97,6612.105,6625.752,"And so I am curious, I am looking at the table that we had up before.",139,,
640,0.97,6626.653,6632.359,"You know, my inclination is to agree that none these weapons should be used for crowd control dispersal, especially in the way that they have been in our city.",139,,
641,0.97,6632.425,6656.449,"And I am also wondering, if there is a crowd control dispersal method, I am thinking particularly about Fascist mobs, that the CPC is thinking, or if there is an existing alternative method of the escalation in these sorts of situations, that we should be Revisiting with SPD.",139,,
642,0.97,6656.516,6658.118,Definitely.,140,,
643,0.97,6658.184,6667.26,"As far as police tactics around crowd control, I think that is definitely a conversation that were willing to have.",140,,
644,0.97,6667.327,6678.038,The Seattle police Department is no longer the only ones weighing these bans on crowd control weapons and such . This is a conversation happening.,140,,
645,0.97,6678.104,6681.841,"In Philadelphia, they're looking to find better ways to not infringe on people.",140,,
646,0.97,6681.908,6706.466,"But also, we acknowledge that there are other situations such as terrorist attacks like we saw in the capital, our recommendations deal with crowd control and the types of first amendment demonstrations that we saw over the summer.",140,,
647,0.97,6706.533,6712.372,That is definitely a continuing conversation that we are having in the CPC.,140,,
648,0.97,6712.439,6715.975,"If it is helpful for reading our recommendations, I am considering the ban on 40 millimeter launchers.",140,,
649,0.97,6716.042,6730.323,"When we were conceiving these, we were continuing to support the elimination of chemical weapons used against protesters in any form . When we were talking about the 40 millimeter launcher, we were more describing the use of phone bullets that SPD is using.",140,,
650,0.97,6730.39,6740.633,Thank you.,141,,
651,0.97,6741.534,6742.435,I have a question.,142,,
652,0.97,6742.502,6744.637,And if you could the Queue.,143,,
653,0.97,6744.704,6784.878,I think the Councilmember Morales and the Commissioner was sort of along the lines of what I am thinking with a lot of these decisions that we are making today . I think the key concern or the key problem is determining the specific definitions and ways to govern the process by which something goes from a first amendment crowd to a mob that is attacking something.,144,,
654,0.97,6784.944,6790.15,And this has been the issue throughout 2020 that I think was very challenging.,144,,
655,0.97,6790.216,6868.995,"It was challenging in our communications with the police Department, disagreement over what constitutes a crowd of people that reflects a threat to person or property versus a crowd of people who are wanting to be heard and to demonstrate . I think that those attended definitions, I know I am Straying from exactly the policy that we are talking about here, but I think it does have implications to have a firmer grip on making sure that if there are policies that are created that envision something like a terrorist attack on a seat of government or a mob with violent intent seeking to disrupt official government proceedings with ill intent, that that is not a definition that can be easily Massaged to justify use of these tools on first amendment demonstrations with implausible arguments that the demonstration was an incipient insurrection.",144,,
656,0.97,6869.062,6901.728,"As we continue to talk about these things, and this is just a brief Digression, despite the horrible initial response by Federal authorities last week to the attack on the capital, the reason members of Congress were not murdered or kidnapped and that those ceremonies were able to continue is there was ultimately a deployment of some lesser lethal munitions that cleared the capital and allowed the authorities to get the capital under control.",144,,
657,0.97,6901.794,6929.255,"It is clear there are contexts where it is essential to have access to some of these tools . personally, I think a lot of this comes down to tightening up the definitions of riot, of mob, of some of the things that have been used over the summer to ground down peaceful assemblies and justify massive uses of force when there are just a few people Digressing the crowd.",144,,
658,0.97,6929.322,6930.323,"Anyway, sorry.",144,,
659,0.97,6930.39,6940.033,That is just a large brain dump of some of my thoughts based on the conversation between Councilmember Morales and the Commissioner.,144,,
660,0.97,6940.099,6944.504,I am sort of in that same place of trying to figure out where we draw some of those boundaries.,144,,
661,0.97,6944.57,6950.843,"Thank you, Lewis.",145,,
662,0.97,6950.91,6972.799,"Just to give a preview of my recommended policy preferences as it relates to these weapons, right now, for this particular weapon, I am recommending that we maintain the ban for crowd control situations.",145,,
663,0.97,6972.865,6983.943,I am not taking the position that the police should not have access to any less lethal weapons in crowd control conditions.,145,,
664,0.97,6984.01,6990.783,So I agree with you that we do need to have a conversation about those conditions.,145,,
665,0.97,6990.85,7019.746,"When using in a crowd control situation and we have flags that we will spend some time in our next committee meeting talking about the conditions, those conditions will be applied in so far as we create exemptions to the ban for the use of these weapons in crowd control situations.",145,,
666,0.97,7019.812,7061.754,"Whether or not you are in concurrence that this particular item should not be used in crowd control situations because of, I should say this particular item as it relates to its use to deploy chemical irritants, if you are in agreement that that should not be a tool that officers have in crowd control situations, then I think we cannot Delve further into the conversation about how to define a riot or what those conditions might be.",145,,
667,0.97,7061.821,7092.084,"But if you are taking a position that we want to retain the use of 40 millimeter launchers to deploy pepper spray, I think that is, the conversation about conditions under which we would allow that exemption for their use in crowd control situations is valid for this slide.",145,,
668,0.97,7092.151,7092.618,Sorry.,146,,
669,0.97,7092.685,7100.126,"To be clear, Madam chair, I concur with Madam chair's position on this policy.",146,,
670,0.97,7100.193,7104.363,I was just making a general Digression that foreshadows things we will talk about later.,146,,
671,0.97,7104.43,7107.433,"So sorry, I should have included that in my remarks.",146,,
672,0.97,7107.5,7109.936,Not a problem.,147,,
673,0.97,7110.002,7111.704,Thank you.,147,,
674,0.97,7111.771,7112.472,Councilmember Sawant?,147,,
675,0.97,7112.538,7113.539,Thank you.,148,,
676,0.97,7113.606,7167.36,"So I just wanted to, just to make sure my comments are about what is being discussed here, this being a little bit changed from the original Powerpoint, since you are asking, Councilmember Herbold, for any comments about launchers launching chemical weapons, I Reserve I comments about other uses of launchers like rubber bullets until the question comes up unless you want me to make those points now, which I don't think you are saying . Actually, before my point on that, I want to clarify the original bill from my office, which was passed in June, asked to ban all launchers.",148,,
677,0.97,7167.426,7168.194,That is the baseline.,148,,
678,0.97,7168.261,7200.593,"Right now, we are talking about using launchers to deploy chemical weapons like pepper spray . absolutely, I oppose the use of launchers for chemical weapons . and I think launchers should be totally banned when shooting chemical weapons . Perhaps the way to do that is to explicitly prohibit those pepper spray munitions.",148,,
679,0.97,7200.66,7202.295,That is a question that needs to be discussed.,148,,
680,0.97,7202.361,7206.832,I cannot imagine a time when something like OC is launched from a 40 millimeter launcher outside of crowd control settings.,148,,
681,0.97,7206.899,7213.272,"Really, it is set up to kind of Terrorize and Brutalize a peaceful protest.",148,,
682,0.97,7213.339,7228.521,"I just don't buy these arguments that are being made that if the police have them, they can prevent a far right mob from causing damage.",148,,
683,0.97,7228.588,7229.121,"Well, they didn't.",148,,
684,0.97,7229.188,7232.558,"They did it later, but they had already caused a lot of terror and damage by then.",148,,
685,0.97,7232.625,7243.336,"If they had controlled the crowd from the beginning, that would not happen.",148,,
686,0.97,7243.402,7247.239,But that is what shows that it is not politically mutual . what the police do is not politically mutual.,148,,
687,0.97,7247.306,7249.275,"They specifically target left wing protests, labor movement protests.",148,,
688,0.97,7249.342,7250.743,There is a lot of history of that.,148,,
689,0.97,7250.81,7261.22,"The civil rights protests, the actions were policed in a way that the never faced . They never faced any retaliation from the police.",148,,
690,0.97,7261.287,7272.365,I am saying that there is a long history behind this . We have to be careful and make sure we understand that the police in many ways were part of enabling the far right terror in the capital.,148,,
691,0.97,7272.431,7277.036,I don't believe a lot of ordinary people believe that giving them more weapons will help them.,148,,
692,0.97,7277.103,7284.944,"As far as our ordinance is concerned, I think we should avoid doing that.",148,,
693,0.97,7285.011,7288.147,"Thank you, Sawant.",149,,
694,0.97,7288.214,7294.654,"All right, let's move on to the next item.",149,,
695,0.97,7294.72,7297.757,Okay.,150,,
696,0.97,7297.823,7299.425,Let me make sure I am not muted.,150,,
697,0.97,7299.492,7305.931,The third item is noise flashed the visionary devices.,150,,
698,0.97,7305.998,7311.07,These create a loud flash . They are sometimes called Flashbangs.,150,,
699,0.97,7311.137,7327.053,"The draft ordinance reflects the consensus that these devices should be banned for use in crowd dispersal's, but available for S.W.A.T.",150,,
700,0.97,7327.119,7340.232,"And patrol officers to use in Non-Crowd control situations . So the policy options shown on this slide option one, to maintain the total ban; option two would be the consensus position in the base bill that would approve exemptions to the ban to allow patrol and S.W.A.T.",150,,
701,0.97,7340.299,7341.067,To use these.,150,,
702,0.97,7341.133,7360.753,"Option three would go, would include option two, but at exceptions to the ban for crowd control situations . option four would make any exceptions subject to added conditions, whether those would be in legislation or drafted with the court in mind.",150,,
703,0.97,7360.82,7367.793,Thank you very much.,151,,
704,0.97,7367.86,7382.641,Lise is outlining some background on the use of flash diversionary devices.,151,,
705,0.97,7382.708,7384.343,"These are cylindrical metal devices, sometimes called Flashbangs.",151,,
706,0.97,7384.41,7391.65,They create a bright flash and a very loud sound.,151,,
707,0.97,7391.717,7394.82,"According to Oig, only S.W.A.T . teams are authorized to use these.",151,,
708,0.97,7394.887,7410.903,"In September, with a central staff memo, there was little information around the noise flash diversionary devices being used in protests . I don't know if we have learned more about their use.",151,,
709,0.97,7410.97,7428.12,"Perhaps the Oig or another organization can speak to that . As background, the CPC has recommended banning for crowd control the device.",151,,
710,0.97,7428.187,7457.817,The op is not Concurring on that particular item . My thought on this is similar to the 40 millimeter launchers being used for chemical irritants.,151,,
711,0.97,7457.883,7485.244,"Even within crowd control situations, there does not appear to be a way to avoid indiscriminate use . There can be harm because, again, this is a device that, as I understand it, can create some harm . It has created harm.",151,,
712,0.97,7485.311,7502.695,"With that, I will check to see whether or not we have our friends at either OPA or Oig to speak to whether they have learned more from complaints about use.",151,,
713,0.97,7502.761,7507.166,I am having a hard time switching over to my camera . feel free to just speak.,151,,
714,0.97,7507.233,7509.235,"Council member, I the Oig.",152,,
715,0.97,7509.301,7517.543,We will refer to the director for specific case usage.,152,,
716,0.97,7517.61,7520.579,I don't have anything to add on the details of their use for specific instances.,152,,
717,0.97,7520.646,7520.98,Appreciate it.,153,,
718,0.97,7521.046,7521.981,Thank you.,153,,
719,0.97,7522.047,7528.254,We don't have this far that any of these were used in the cases we have investigated.,154,,
720,0.97,7528.32,7538.764,"Thank you, director.",155,,
721,0.97,7540.165,7552.711,"So, other comments about this policy option, the issue and the options identified?",155,,
722,0.97,7552.778,7562.221,"Again, option two would be to approve the ban outside of patrol and S.W.A.T.",155,,
723,0.97,7562.288,7569.361,And maintain a ban in place for crowd control situations . that is what I am putting on the table.,155,,
724,0.97,7569.428,7578.437,I am happy to hear other preferences from other members.,155,,
725,0.97,7578.504,7580.906,This is Councilmember Sawant.,156,,
726,0.97,7580.973,7583.709,Councilmember,157,,
727,0.97,7583.776,7587.579,Thank you.,158,,
728,0.97,7587.646,7640.399,"My comments to some degree will be about the pepper spray, rubber bullets, and Flashbangs or noise diversionary devices . They all have the same recommendations from the community police Commission and are described the same in the draft bill that was sent out from your office, Councilmember Herbold, and forwarded to other members last night . that is in addition to the other memo on possible options as we have seen in the presentations, which could include loopholes . As Councilmember Herbold mentioned, there is a change in the baseline compared to the original ordinance.",158,,
729,0.97,7640.466,7650.175,I wanted to address that . I do not object to the idea of having an exception outside protest settings.,158,,
730,0.97,7650.242,7652.644,"However, I do have concerns about the specific language in the baseline bill.",158,,
731,0.97,7652.711,7661.353,There was one line in the baseline bill that concerns what was discussed when my original crowd control weapons ban was discussed over the summer.,158,,
732,0.97,7661.42,7690.783,The change in the bill or rather the statement in what is now the new baseline bill says these various devices are not less lethal weapons for purchase of owning or storing . But then there is an addition there.,158,,
733,0.97,7690.849,7730.856,"Unless such weapons are used for crowd control purposes . My concern is that this language, the language that says unless they are used for crowd dispersal purposes, my concern is that this language, what happens if police spray crowd with Mace or set off a flash bang and say it was not intended for crowd control or crowd dispersal purposes, but intended to stop one person from throwing a bottle.",158,,
734,0.97,7730.923,7732.758,I know I am not stating a hypothetical case.,158,,
735,0.97,7732.825,7734.493,This is happened time after time.,158,,
736,0.97,7734.56,7741.166,"Again, as I said, I had stated this concern at that time, as well, in the summer.",158,,
737,0.97,7741.233,7750.509,"This complaint was dismissed against the child was Maced in the face, saying the child was not the intended target.",158,,
738,0.97,7750.576,7755.414,"At that time, it was a brutal example.",158,,
739,0.97,7755.481,7761.687,"Over the summer, when we were voting on that ordinance, I suggested a different language in an attempt to address this issue.",158,,
740,0.97,7761.753,7783.175,"I wanted to reiterate my desire to work with the chair and the committee members on the language to focus on banning those weapons, but not to make the purpose, or the stated purpose of the police as a test on whether or not they are complying with the ordinance.",158,,
741,0.97,7783.242,7784.91,"Thank you, Sawant.",159,,
742,0.97,7784.977,7842.134,"If I hear you correctly, you are talking about conditions that would limit the use of certain crowd control weapons, less lethal weapons in situations that might involve a crowd, but to ensure that they are not using, they are not being used to control the crowd, the being used to control the activity of the individuals within the crowd . unless you are interested in an option other than simply approving exemptions to the ban for patrol and S.W.A.T.",159,,
743,0.97,7842.201,7863.255,"For noise flash diversionary devices, unless you want to create an exemption to the ban to also include crowd control situations, I request that we hold that discussion similarly to what I have requested of Councilmember Lewis to the next two items, which are pepper spray and tear gas.",159,,
744,0.97,7863.322,7873.165,"I am happy to hold discussion . But just to clarify, maybe I didn't speak correctly to express my concerns.",160,,
745,0.97,7873.232,7885.911,What I am saying is they should not be used in a crowd at all . I don't want them to be used on peaceful protesters.,160,,
746,0.97,7885.978,7899.858,"I also don't want to to be used on one peaceful protest or if we make it about what the police claim was the purpose, then that is the problem.",160,,
747,0.97,7899.925,7900.325,Understood.,161,,
748,0.97,7900.392,7914.039,"At this point, we are talking about the noise flash diversionary devices, which are by their nature Impacting of the whole crowd and cannot be used in a targeted way.",161,,
749,0.97,7914.106,7930.088,"I am suggesting that option two, we approve only the exemptions for patrol and S.W.A.T., maintaining the ban for crowd control situations.",161,,
750,0.97,7930.155,7930.489,Okay.,162,,
751,0.97,7930.555,7931.29,Thank you for that.,162,,
752,0.97,7931.356,7933.025,No problem.,163,,
753,0.97,7933.091,7943.302,Thank you.,163,,
754,0.97,7944.236,7947.572,Do other Councilmembers want to weigh in now?,163,,
755,0.97,7947.639,7952.778,"If not, we can move onto the last few items.",163,,
756,0.97,7952.844,7953.445,All right.,163,,
757,0.97,7953.512,7955.647,Last two items.,163,,
758,0.97,7955.714,7959.951,Okay.,164,,
759,0.97,7960.018,7973.932,"This fourth item here is pepper spray, which distributes a substance that causes an intense burning sensation with skin, eyes, Mucous Membranes on contact.",164,,
760,0.97,7973.999,8008.6,"Pepper spray should be banned for use for crowd dispersal, but available for S.W.A.T . and patrol officers to use in Non-Crowd control situations . The options here, option one would retain the partial ban in ordinance 126102 that originally disallowed the use of pepper spray in a menstruation or other first amendment protected events, but would allow it if it did not land on more than one individual in patrol situations.",164,,
761,0.97,8008.667,8011.069,Option two would approve the ban for both patrol and S.W.A.T.,164,,
762,0.97,8011.136,8043.635,"Option three would approve the ban for patrol and S.W.A.T . and also make exceptions for crowd control situations . option four would specify exemptions to the ban subject to at a conditions, either in the legislation or drafted subject to court approval.",164,,
763,0.97,8046.805,8049.641,In the memo I I unnecessarily complicated things.,165,,
764,0.97,8049.708,8053.912,The ordinance already includes some conditions.,165,,
765,0.97,8053.979,8114.773,"I am supportive of the need for conversation around the language that is in the existing ordinance with the understanding that we may need to have a discussion about additional conditions that are required to be met before pepper spray can be used in an event with multiple individuals . This is one of the items that I would like to, like ordinance 126102 does, work to specify some of those conditions within the bill itself.",165,,
766,0.97,8118.043,8133.024,And I am looking to see if anybody is coming off mute here . I am not seeing anybody come off mute.,165,,
767,0.97,8133.091,8141.299,I am not seeing anybody's hand raised in the hand raising function.,165,,
768,0.97,8141.366,8143.368,So let's move on to the last item.,165,,
769,0.97,8143.435,8153.545,"So the last item is gas, which is a chemical agent designed to cause coughing and physical distress.",166,,
770,0.97,8153.612,8170.395,"The draft ordinance would sustain the ban on tear gas . We do note that the, Billy--the accountability agencies agreed that officers should not be able to use tear gas, which is option two.",166,,
771,0.97,8170.462,8189.481,"But the agencies differ as to whether or not it should be available to the S.W.A.T . unit . The options here are option one, maintaining the total ban for the adopted ordinance; option two, maintaining the ban on total control.",166,,
772,0.97,8189.548,8193.118,Option Hree would approve the ban on control and specify additional exceptions to the ban for S.W.A.T.,166,,
773,0.97,8193.184,8194.519,And or crowd control situations.,166,,
774,0.97,8194.586,8208.833,"Option four would then add exceptions subject to additional conditions, either written into the legislation or drafted by SPD with court approval.",166,,
775,0.97,8208.9,8214.205,"Thank you, lise.",167,,
776,0.97,8214.272,8228.019,"Again, as far as the background as stated, the CPC is continuing to advocate for a total ban.",167,,
777,0.97,8228.086,8339.397,"The Oig and the OPA are not taking that position . We all witnessed and some of us experienced the use of tear gas night after night, specifically on Capitol Hill . I think we are unified in our belief that how tear gas has been used has not been acceptable . It is not acceptable that tear gas has been used in contravention of the restraining order . We all, I think, remember the heart wrenching story of a family that fled their home when their baby started coughing and the fear that the family had for their young child's life . Within this context, we do have to consider the concerns that we have heard both from judge Robart about a total ban; the Oig list the concerns about their use specifically as it related to small particles of cs that, they disperse widely . As demonstrated by complaints from residents about cs seeping into their homes during the demonstrations on Capitol Hill, yes.",167,,
778,0.97,8339.464,8350.041,The Department and the Council may want to consider limiting use of this weapon to full-scale riot situations involving violence.,167,,
779,0.97,8350.108,8366.991,"Clearly, as we have discussed before, the state definition of riot is completely unsatisfactory based on the minimum number of people necessary to declare a riot being three people.",167,,
780,0.97,8367.058,8391.816,"The recognition that tear gas has the potential utility in crowd control situations is present in my mind, but I really feel strongly that any exception has to be very narrowly tailored.",167,,
781,0.97,8391.883,8398.022,We cannot have a repeat of the experience of the last six months.,167,,
782,0.97,8398.089,8432.457,"The SPD and the Council, I think, should have a conversation as recommended by the Oig about an outright ban even in crowd control situations . When the use of tear gas is solely in the defense of property, that is a condition I would like to consider for purposes of this legislation.",167,,
783,0.97,8432.524,8491.783,"I am interested to know, and perhaps we can do a little bit of research, because I think the conversation--if there is a recognition by my colleagues on the Council that tear gas, we might consider Reauthorizing tear gas in crowd control situations dependent on conditions . I think it would be useful to know whether or not there are other cities that explicitly say that tear gas should not be used in defense of property, but only in defense of life . I want to just reference also, again, my interest in trying to codify some of these conditions in our ordinance itself.",167,,
784,0.97,8491.85,8510.635,"I want to ensure that, again, isolated, unlawful activity by individuals or small groups within a crowd will never automatically form the basis for declaring an assembly unlawful or justify the use of less lethal tools, weapons that harm multiple people.",167,,
785,0.97,8510.702,8524.048,"We also talked about conditions such as the requirement to develop tactical, detailed tactical plans prior to deployment.",167,,
786,0.97,8524.115,8534.792,That is in addition to the previously stated criteria . I am very interested in Codifying that.,167,,
787,0.97,8534.859,8560.051,"And then another piece that I am interested in considering is delaying the authorization date for the use of tear gas in a situation as defined by conditions should not be once this ordinance approved by the court, I believe.",167,,
788,0.97,8560.118,8569.861,I think we need to take a careful look at the gaps in training and only authorize the redeployment after such training is completed.,167,,
789,0.97,8569.928,8590.248,I believe that Judge Robart spoke to this particular element of the need for training and the need for authorization of these weapons in a way that occurs only once sufficient training has occurred.,167,,
790,0.97,8590.315,8617.909,"That is another element I am interested in considering as it relates to creating exceptions to the ban with conditions . with that, I will pause I will see what colleagues comments are available.",167,,
791,0.97,8617.976,8632.724,I am looking for people to come off of mute or to see whether or not any Councilmembers had their hand raised.,167,,
792,0.97,8632.79,8634.759,"In the meantime, I see Amy has her hand raised.",167,,
793,0.97,8634.826,8646.17,"Just very briefly speaking of conditions, in addition to the possibility of situations applying to property, white she would also be supportive of not having it used in dense residential areas.",168,,
794,0.97,8646.237,8647.939,That would be another potential condition for consideration.,168,,
795,0.97,8648.006,8650.208,Thank you.,169,,
796,0.97,8650.274,8650.742,Councilmember Sawant?,169,,
797,0.97,8650.808,8656.28,I see your hand is raised.,169,,
798,0.97,8656.347,8664.122,I think that to continue to be totally banned in all situations.,170,,
799,0.97,8664.188,8670.495,I believe the community police Commission agrees.,170,,
800,0.97,8670.561,8680.538,"It would be frankly shocking if the city council considered Reauthorizing tear gas in any use, given that the codes created an injunction.",170,,
801,0.97,8680.605,8687.845,I am also extremely concerned about the direction of the discussion.,170,,
802,0.97,8687.912,8709.367,"I think this is influenced by the position that has been developed of creating an exception for using tear gas when there is danger to people . This is the word of the police, that there is danger to people . I don't think that passes muster based on overwhelming evidence.",170,,
803,0.97,8709.434,8710.735,The police say they always feel threatened.,170,,
804,0.97,8710.802,8712.57,I was at the Capitol Hill protests.,170,,
805,0.97,8712.637,8722.68,"Obviously, hundreds of young people, especially courageous protesters, got tear gassed night after night.",170,,
806,0.97,8722.747,8729.42,"My staff member, Adam, and I were also there.",170,,
807,0.97,8729.487,8733.291,"One of those nights, we were also targeted.",170,,
808,0.97,8733.357,8743.434,"Four hours before then, the public announcement system, it was a disembodied voice.",170,,
809,0.97,8743.501,8745.336,I could not see the face of the commander.,170,,
810,0.97,8745.403,8765.79,"I don't know where he was . But he kept saying, and I am Paraphrasing Obviously, but something along the lines of we feel that this is threatening . If you keep moving forward, that is threatening.",170,,
811,0.97,8765.857,8778.769,"That will leave us no choice but to deploy weapons that we don't really want to use . and the stark contrast between the protesters with whom I was standing who had nothing with them except their umbrellas and cell phones, and a fully armed to the teeth police force with riot gear and all kinds of shields.",170,,
812,0.97,8778.836,8787.879,They also had body shields on every part of their body . They had helmets.,170,,
813,0.97,8787.945,8790.348,There was a sniper on one of the roofs.,170,,
814,0.97,8790.414,8795.253,"In that situation, they claimed that they were feeling threatened.",170,,
815,0.97,8795.319,8798.456,I feel that is just a slippery slope.,170,,
816,0.97,8798.523,8808.032,"If you create that Oh opening, they will always use it as an excuse.",170,,
817,0.97,8808.099,8809.367,They will say they feel threatened.,170,,
818,0.97,8809.433,8818.776,"With your permission, Councilmember Herbold, I wanted to talk about something that is confusing to me.",170,,
819,0.97,8818.843,8823.381,I am not totally clear about how you are wanting to structure the questions and also the presentation.,170,,
820,0.97,8823.447,8830.788,I am concerned about how the options are divided into asking about approving for patrol or S.W.A.T.,170,,
821,0.97,8830.855,8832.19,Versus crowd control.,170,,
822,0.97,8832.256,8837.061,That confuses me be because patrol and S.W.A.T.,170,,
823,0.97,8837.128,8860.618,"Are exactly the officers deployed against protests . that is one of the reasons why in the original ordinance from my office and the grassroots movement, we phrased the things in terms of protests and other first amendment protected events.",170,,
824,0.97,8860.685,8870.094,"That is one of the reasons why when I last spoke, I quoted the language of the proposed legislation.",170,,
825,0.97,8870.161,8872.43,I am sure you will agree the devil is in the details.,170,,
826,0.97,8872.496,8882.74,"The language from my original bill stated the test for which we would say that the police could or could not use, it is used in a demonstration rally or other first amendment protected event.",170,,
827,0.97,8882.807,8886.41,That is how it was stated in the original bill.,170,,
828,0.97,8886.477,8897.521,"In my view, that is much more clarifying and is a much better test that the police's actions can be healthy.",170,,
829,0.97,8897.588,8905.93,I agree that the conversation around definitions is important.,171,,
830,0.97,8905.997,8918.943,Greg Doss agreed about needing the conversation for those definitions.,171,,
831,0.97,8919.01,8921.912,Looking at options for definitions will tell us more about which is the better approach.,171,,
832,0.97,8921.979,8931.522,The policy options in this decision agenda are structured around the recommendations that we received from accountability partners.,171,,
833,0.97,8931.589,8945.703,"So that is why were kind of using these terms, crowd control, patrol, or S.W.A.T . They are intended to talk about circumstances, not types of officers.",171,,
834,0.97,8945.77,8949.407,"Again, I totally agree that this is a conversation that we need to have.",171,,
835,0.97,8949.473,8955.479,And we need to have additional clarity in the ordinance about that.,171,,
836,0.97,8955.546,8957.315,Councilmember Morales?,171,,
837,0.97,8957.381,8958.949,I see your hand.,171,,
838,0.97,8959.016,8960.584,Thank you.,172,,
839,0.97,8960.651,8969.293,I will be brief.,172,,
840,0.97,8969.36,8981.072,We had a discussion about all of these things yesterday and I indicated then that this is the one issue or one weapon that I really think we need to ban entirely.,172,,
841,0.97,8981.138,8984.542,Tear gas is indiscriminate . It is toxic.,172,,
842,0.97,8984.608,8997.121,It has been ban by international law in warfare . I don't understand why we would use something like this in our cities.,172,,
843,0.97,8997.188,9031.322,"It has been ban across the globe . So especially when we see how it has been used in our city and the impact it has on our neighbors, if we are saying, if the recommendation is not to allow or to put parameters outside of dense populations, to me that means it is not used in our city . I would advocate for an entire ban on this particular weapon.",172,,
844,0.97,9031.389,9057.581,"I just want to that, if that ends up being the position of this Committee, then that is pretty much as it Rlates to, after having gone through all these items, as it relates to crowd control situations, that is pretty much the status quo of the bill that we have already heard from the court.",173,,
845,0.97,9057.648,9063.687,The court feels that it is Overbroad.,173,,
846,0.97,9063.754,9080.171,"Again, the ordinance as already reviewed by the court did allow for some narrow uses of pepper spray . We have continued to take that position.",173,,
847,0.97,9080.237,9094.018,"We want to maintain the ban in crowd control situations for the launchers, for Flashbangs, and for blast balls.",173,,
848,0.97,9094.084,9100.491,And this may be an issue that we don't have a consensus position on.,173,,
849,0.97,9100.558,9106.23,But we would like to hear from my other colleagues on the committee.,173,,
850,0.97,9106.297,9112.903,That is if they have thoughts.,173,,
851,0.97,9112.97,9114.738,"That Unshare, I have couple of thoughts.",174,,
852,0.97,9114.805,9142.967,"Here is my concern, because I agree with what Councilmember Morales shared regarding this particular weapon in regards to the completely indiscriminate nature of it relative to the other things we have discussed today, the public health impacts that it has particularly in regards to deployment in dense residential neighborhoods that we saw throughout last year.",174,,
853,0.97,9143.033,9163.888,"My concern is that as we get into crafting and developing certain exceptions, that is inherently going to involve certain discretionary decision points that people in the police Department will get to make decisions on.",174,,
854,0.97,9163.954,9185.609,"We had one particular evening, during the week of the most indiscriminate tear gas use in the demonstrations last year in June, a week that culminated in a very broad pronouncement from the Mayor and the police Department about putting sideboards on the discretion to use tear gas.",174,,
855,0.97,9185.676,9197.388,That evening culminated in the deployment of tear gas or in the deployment of some agent akin to tear gas.,174,,
856,0.97,9197.454,9213.938,My concern is balancing that with the reality that I can definitely envision circumstances where the deployment of a weapon like tear gas could be warranted in a very rare event.,174,,
857,0.97,9214.004,9228.485,"I think it is worth noting that the city had not really used or employed tear gas extensively, with the exception of demonstrations last year, for a long history.",174,,
858,0.97,9228.552,9232.723,So there are clearly ways to limit the use.,174,,
859,0.97,9232.79,9247.571,"But I have concern . If we are to go and try to specify exemptions, where there are discretionary decision points, and what kind of sideboards there are.",174,,
860,0.97,9247.638,9278.669,"Again, I think that kind of comes back to the tightening of definitions, the tightening of circumstances under which certain States can be declared to be in an existence of riot or a mob or whatever else . as it currently stands, it is my observation that those definitions were considerably stretched over the course of last year to justify the use of weapons like this.",174,,
861,0.97,9278.736,9282.506,I can totally envision circumstances where it would be warranted.,174,,
862,0.97,9282.573,9302.96,"As I mentioned earlier, it is possible, the electoral votes last week could have been stolen and members of Congress could have been murdered except for the deployment of some of these weapons to Retake the capital.",174,,
863,0.97,9303.027,9319.476,In figuring out those discretion points and putting on sideboards to prevent considerable damage to the community and to people Úexercising their first amendment rights is something we really need to carefully look into in specifying those exemptions to possible ban conditions.,174,,
864,0.97,9319.543,9332.122,I am just putting that out there.,174,,
865,0.97,9336.06,9337.061,"Thank you, Lewis.",175,,
866,0.97,9337.127,9358.749,I am looking to see whether there are any additional thoughts from Councilmembers . I am not seeing anyone coming off me.,175,,
867,0.97,9358.816,9367.424,Councilmember would just say that I am inclined to support the option that you have put forward for us as a starting point.,176,,
868,0.97,9367.491,9386.343,I do think it is important for us to work on this policy issue in a manner that will truly be responsive to the concerns that we heard from the Federal court.,176,,
869,0.97,9386.41,9394.051,So I understand that we still need to have additional policy conversations about this . But I think the option that you have set forward in your base bill is a reasonable place for us to start the conversation.,176,,
870,0.97,9394.118,9394.818,Thank you.,177,,
871,0.97,9394.885,9444.334,"What I would like to propose, because I am not hearing consensus as it relates to this policy option, is that we work with central staff between now and the next committee meeting . Then we can bring back two options, one to retain the total ban for tear gas and another, those of us who want to allow some narrow exemptions that don't have a lot of discretion and include conditions for use in crowd control situations, we work to develop that between now and the next committee meeting . Then we will have an up or down vote on both options for the next committee meeting.",177,,
872,0.97,9444.401,9460.15,"I want to be fair to the deference of opinion around this particular item . I want to see, is that acceptable to folks?",177,,
873,0.97,9460.217,9462.953,"I am sorry, Herbold.",178,,
874,0.97,9463.02,9465.923,Can you summarize that again?,178,,
875,0.97,9465.989,9469.96,I think we a lot of areas where there is consensus.,179,,
876,0.97,9470.027,9483.707,So my expectation for central staff is to bring us back a new base bill for the 26th that reflects those areas of consensus.,179,,
877,0.97,9483.774,9485.909,This is an area where there is not consensus.,179,,
878,0.97,9485.976,9497.187,"I am suggesting that for the next committee meeting that we have two options, as painful as that may be.",179,,
879,0.97,9497.254,9518.775,"One is to continue the total ban and the others to identify for those of us who are interested in creating a narrow exception to the ban without a lot of exception, with conditions and potentially an effective date that allows for authorization only after certain things occur.",179,,
880,0.97,9518.842,9534.391,We can bring that option back and we can consider both options in the next Iteration at the next committee meeting . all right.,179,,
881,0.97,9534.458,9546.77,Not hearing any strong feeling--Councilmember Gonzalez?,179,,
882,0.97,9546.837,9547.604,I would support that.,180,,
883,0.97,9547.671,9572.829,"As we think about the fact that we don't have consensus here, I am reminded about the 2017 accountability ordinance process, in which there were several areas in which there were disagreements amongst the parties regarding the options to set forth in the accountability ordinance . in that instance, we did submit to judge Robart a set of options that were being considered as a policy position.",180,,
884,0.97,9572.896,9592.215,"I just wonder if we are unable to achieve consensus here as a committee, if this area lends itself to that kind of a structure moving forward to allow the Federal Court monitor and the judge to consider.",180,,
885,0.97,9592.282,9593.283,Thank you.,181,,
886,0.97,9593.35,9603.46,"I think that is definitely a strategy worth looking into . Councilmember Sawant, did I see you raise your hand?",181,,
887,0.97,9603.527,9604.428,Yes.,182,,
888,0.97,9604.494,9618.809,"Sorry, I had a couple of questions based on what you were proposing as to the process moving forward.",182,,
889,0.97,9618.875,9627.05,I don't have an Overarching objection to what you just said.,182,,
890,0.97,9627.117,9636.76,"I am also a little confused . that I had another question . isn't the current bill, doesn't it reflect consensus on most of the points?",182,,
891,0.97,9636.827,9654.444,"I am not sure what the new draft that you're talking about, it will be the same except it won't have language on tear gas where there is an consensus? is that what you are saying?",182,,
892,0.97,9654.511,9655.679,"Yes, that is my",183,,
893,0.97,9655.746,9656.646,Okay.,184,,
894,0.97,9656.713,9665.222,"For other new bill reflects, will be updated to reflect our discussion today.",185,,
895,0.97,9665.288,9665.589,Okay.,186,,
896,0.97,9665.655,9673.296,The other question I had goes back to my concern about how we are defining things.,186,,
897,0.97,9673.363,9676.166,"Thank you for your response, Amy.",186,,
898,0.97,9676.233,9677.968,You talked about how you restructured things.,186,,
899,0.97,9678.035,9683.106,This structure followed the structure of the recommendations of the different agencies.,186,,
900,0.97,9683.173,9692.416,But I am still worried that if we structure things as a Troll versus S.W.A.T.,186,,
901,0.97,9692.482,9702.592,"Versus crowd control, that we may not get to what we really want to get to I am going to ask, is the structure open to discussion or not?",186,,
902,0.97,9702.659,9716.54,"As mentioned, Greg flagged the need to have some definitions around patrol and S.W.A.T.",187,,
903,0.97,9716.606,9727.384,"To clarify that we are not talking about who, because patrol officers and S.W.A.T . officers staff crowd control events.",187,,
904,0.97,9727.451,9729.019,We are talking about the type of events.,187,,
905,0.97,9729.086,9748.805,"We will have those definitions, we will have a discussion around those definitions . and if we find that they are not sufficient for regulating the circumstances under which these weapons are being used, then we can talk about a different approach.",187,,
906,0.97,9748.872,9751.708,Okay.,188,,
907,0.97,9751.775,9752.342,Thank you.,188,,
908,0.97,9752.409,9763.653,"This is a very long conversation, necessary and thoughtful . I really appreciate everybody's participation.",188,,
909,0.97,9763.72,9775.232,"Again, on the slide, next steps . potentially a referral of a new bill because we have a new title.",188,,
910,0.97,9775.298,9782.172,Committee recommendation on January 26 on our next committee.,188,,
911,0.97,9782.239,9784.441,In the request to the monitor to review a draft bill.,188,,
912,0.97,9784.508,9795.585,"If there is nothing more for the good of the order, it is 12:14 P.M.",188,,
913,0.97,9795.652,9796.82,And we are adjourned.,188,,
914,0.97,9796.887,9806.029,"Thank you, everybody.",188,,
