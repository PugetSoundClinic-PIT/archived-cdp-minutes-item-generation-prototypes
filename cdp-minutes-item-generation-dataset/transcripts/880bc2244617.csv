88,0.97,378.411,383.516,And I'm here to speak about the tree ordinance.,24,,
89,0.97,383.516,389.255,First I appreciate Y'all being there today in July and what has been done so far with the ordinance.,24,,
90,0.97,389.255,393.059,I appreciate all of the participants.,24,,
91,0.97,393.059,395.228,Happy birthday Council member Juarez.,24,,
92,0.97,395.228,411.11,"Required mitigation for allowed tree removal where it says all Evergreens must be replaced by eye Evergreen, on-site it says the property owner shall ensure that the trees planted remain healthy.",24,,
93,0.97,411.11,412.345,I have definitely seen otherwise.,24,,
94,0.97,412.345,417.817,Will it be written into the sales agreement for the property owner to agree to take care of the trees?,24,,
95,0.97,417.817,419.886,Who will ensure this happens?,24,,
96,0.97,419.886,427.627,"If the replacement is on public property, where?",24,,
97,0.97,427.627,428.027,The Right-Of-Way?,24,,
98,0.97,428.027,428.261,S-Dot?,24,,
99,0.97,428.261,431.864,S-Dot has specific trees for Sprite trees and they do not include large Evergreens.,24,,
100,0.97,431.864,438.704,"On parks property, is this part of the parks budget, maintenance.",24,,
101,0.97,438.704,442.909,They barely maintain what is already there.,24,,
102,0.97,442.909,448.014,Two huge significant Poplars are proposed to be removed and several exceptional trees.,24,,
103,0.97,448.014,450.616,Where would this size of tree be replaced.,24,,
104,0.97,450.616,456.456,It takes too long for the tree that is plant today replace the canopy.,24,,
105,0.97,456.456,460.092,Climate is changing and the benefits to our air cannot wait.,24,,
106,0.97,460.092,469.468,The tree ordinance needs to require that the equivalent replacement canopy area and volume be reached in 25 years.,24,,
107,0.97,469.468,469.836,Very important.,24,,
108,0.97,469.836,470.236,Area and volume.,24,,
109,0.97,470.236,475.641,There need to be strong protections for existing mature trees.,24,,
110,0.97,475.641,483.316,Our problem with retaining a 09- year-old exceptional tulip tree is the developer could not achieve its potential.,24,,
111,0.97,483.316,484.817,So he was allowed to cut it down.,24,,
112,0.97,484.817,497.33,I don't see any change to the code that allows tree removal when the developer can't get what he wants.,24,,
113,0.97,497.33,503.069,Real tree production needs to be written in actual code and enforced.,24,,
114,0.97,503.069,503.369,Thank you.,24,,
115,0.97,503.369,504.103,"Thank you, Suzanne.",25,,
116,0.97,504.103,510.343,Up next is Steve followed by Juanita and Woody Wheeler.,25,,
117,0.97,510.343,512.311,"Steve, please go ahead.",25,,
118,0.97,512.311,514.58,Okay.,26,,
119,0.97,514.58,517.216,My name is Steve Zemke.,26,,
120,0.97,517.216,524.423,I'm speaking today as chair of tree pact.,26,,
121,0.97,524.423,529.262,We want to thank you for your efforts going forward.,26,,
122,0.97,529.262,532.131,The updates of the resolution that you passed.,26,,
123,0.97,532.131,542.375,"I want to note that the resolution States that at the end of the process that legislation be submitted to the Council, I want to speak to that particularly.",26,,
124,0.97,542.375,567.099,"Because of the regulations that are being updated today, the problem is that the question of having a diverse--diversity of old tree species and ages, the Seattle municipal code 23 in terms of land use States during plotting that all trees that are six inches and larger need to be shown on the site.",26,,
125,0.97,567.099,572.772,And there needs to be an effort made to maximize their attention to existing trees.,26,,
126,0.97,572.772,582.248,"We think this process needs to continue through the whole development process, not just deal with exceptional trees at the end of the process that is occurring now.",26,,
127,0.97,582.248,590.156,Second issue I want to reference to the Council is the urban forestry letter.,26,,
128,0.97,590.156,608.441,"Already raised the question it appears that the administration enforcement of the tree ordinance and other provisions in SBCI, that there is no clear Department section or division that is responsible for the overall tree protection.",26,,
129,0.97,608.441,619.952,"And we believe that we need--the SBCI needs to establish a separate division to have a clear path for urban forestry decision making, resolution and increase in accountability.",26,,
130,0.97,619.952,635.134,And Lastly we want to urge that you use the draft tree protection ordinance by the urban forestry Commission as your starting point in terms of moving towards final ordinance passage by the Council.,26,,
131,0.97,642.141,644.61,"Thank you, Steve.",27,,
132,0.97,644.61,651.45,Up next we have Juanita Salinas followed by Woody Wheeler and Andrew Kitty.,27,,
133,0.97,651.45,654.487,Apologies.,27,,

137,0.97,662.428,662.928,"Good morning, everyone.",28,,
138,0.97,662.928,663.562,I'm Juanita Salinas.,28,,
139,0.97,663.562,667.233,I'm here today in support of the child care near you proposal.,28,,
140,0.97,667.233,675.775,We believe the changes outlined in the proposal will reap many benefits for our early learning community.,28,,
141,0.97,675.775,684.116,Proven and Pourful nonprofit that improves communities and people's lives by creating well designed affordable homes.,28,,
142,0.97,684.116,699.031,We recognize the critical importance to access quality safe and affordable early child care and how it impacts growth Exponentially for the child and family when we have a safe and affordable and quality home.,28,,
143,0.97,699.031,703.936,Our initiative is centered on the promise of opportunity.,28,,
144,0.97,703.936,712.578,"So long before Covid-19 pandemic, Washington state ranked 6th in the nation for people living in child care deserts.",28,,
145,0.97,712.578,716.415,Today the state is reporting 20% or more of child care centers have closed.,28,,
146,0.97,716.415,729.428,"For some time now, the city of Seattle has already been facing we continue to deal with these implications and the impacts of Covid-19 and assess our recovery.",28,,
147,0.97,729.428,736.035,We need to make sure that we have ample adequate and accessible child care.,28,,
148,0.97,736.035,740.306,It is Eaccepttial for bringing back our workforce.,28,,
149,0.97,740.306,749.482,"So we support the proposal because we believe it will, one, allow child care centers to open at a time when many are struggling to stay open.",28,,
150,0.97,749.482,757.49,And will help support those who have closed their doors permanently to have a possibility to reopen.,28,,
151,0.97,757.49,768.701,We also support this proposal because it can renew potentially cumbersome barriers for taxed providers.,28,,
152,0.97,768.701,776.442,We believe it will create opportunities for children and families to receive care especially now when families are working from home long- term.,28,,
153,0.97,776.442,782.047,And we believe it will allow provider toes more innovative in creating centers across the city.,28,,
154,0.97,782.047,794.426,We ask that the land use and neighborhoods committee today vote yes to advance this proposal for approval.,28,,
155,0.97,794.426,798.697,This is a Tenu tenuous time for our workforce.,28,,
156,0.97,798.697,799.298,Thank you.,29,,
157,0.97,799.298,805.771,"If you want to make a short comment during the public hearing on child care near you, we have heard all of your words.",29,,
158,0.97,805.771,811.877,"If you want to let the record reflect on the next section, we would love to have your voice recorded there.",29,,

161,0.97,830.095,833.399,Woody.,29,,
162,0.97,833.399,838.404,Are you ready?,29,,

167,0.97,844.543,848.414,So I'm speaking on the tree ordinance.,32,,
168,0.97,848.414,849.014,Thank you for listening.,32,,
169,0.97,849.014,855.921,It is high time for Seattle to pass a new and improved tree ordinance that addresses comments made here today.,32,,
170,0.97,855.921,866.732,Every day we delay as passage more trees fall and tree canopy decreases while heat Islands increase and the city becomes less livable for everyone.,32,,
171,0.97,866.732,874.94,In particular the city needs to close loopholes to adequately protect exceptional trees and tree groves.,32,,
172,0.97,874.94,890.789,"I am referring especially to the loophole that says on city Website and I quote, if you are developing your property, you may remove trees if retaining them prevents you from achieving the allowed lot coverage, end of quote.",32,,
173,0.97,890.789,899.265,"On December 27th, 2019, I witnessed with horror the taking of an exceptional Western Hemlock by a neighbor due to this loophole.",32,,
174,0.97,899.265,906.572,"It was one of Seattle's last 6,000 and now part of the increasing heat Island.",32,,
175,0.97,906.572,910.309,This incremental destruction of our most important trees is happening all over town.,32,,
176,0.97,910.309,923.389,"I would also like to point out that there is a nexus between tree removal, climate change and social justice that this ordinance addresses.",32,,
177,0.97,923.389,928.694,"First quote by Dr. Robert Bollard, professor at Southern Texas University.",32,,
178,0.97,928.694,934.199,"If it is going to be too hot outside, we know who going to be affected.",32,,
179,0.97,934.199,945.11,"If we're talking about urban heat Islands, we know who cannot afford to run their air conditioners 24/7, end quote.",32,,
180,0.97,945.11,951.15,Second quote author of the best selling how to be an Anti- racist book.,32,,
181,0.97,951.15,957.222,"His quote reads as follows, do nothing climate policy is racist.",32,,
182,0.97,957.222,957.756,End of quote.,32,,
183,0.97,957.756,966.398,"In conclusion, I recommend that we pass the revised tree ordinance in 2020 for social and environmental justice.",32,,
184,0.97,966.398,967.933,Thank you for listening.,32,,
185,0.97,967.933,971.27,"Thank you, Woody.",33,,
186,0.97,971.27,972.738,Up next is Andrew Kitty.,33,,
187,0.97,972.738,975.941,I apologize if I'm saying that incorrectly.,33,,
188,0.97,975.941,977.843,Followed by Michael and David.,33,,
189,0.97,977.843,995.861,"At the end of Andrew's public comment, we will have reached the--reach Thed end of our public comment and I will need to extend public comment for my colleagues' awareness.",33,,
190,0.97,995.861,996.095,Andrew.,33,,
191,0.97,996.095,996.462,I'm Andrew.,34,,
192,0.97,996.462,1003.902,And I'm here to talk about the child care near you ordinance.,34,,
193,0.97,1003.902,1007.74,I'm curious before I get started if I should be Testifying at a different time.,34,,
194,0.97,1007.74,1013.345,Please remind me the item that you are referring?,35,,
195,0.97,1013.345,1014.346,There was background noise.,35,,
196,0.97,1014.346,1017.683,The child care near you ordinance.,36,,
197,0.97,1017.683,1018.083,Yes.,37,,
198,0.97,1018.083,1019.718,There is a separate public hearing for that.,37,,
199,0.97,1019.718,1022.254,Let's have you move over there.,37,,
200,0.97,1022.254,1022.521,Okay.,38,,
201,0.97,1022.521,1024.857,I want to check with it.,39,,
202,0.97,1024.857,1038.404,Can we make that change internally?,39,,
203,0.97,1038.404,1039.071,Yes.,40,,
204,0.97,1039.071,1043.075,We will move that.,40,,
205,0.97,1043.075,1045.377,"Thank you, Andrew.",41,,
206,0.97,1045.377,1047.112,"And Michael Oxman, you are up.",41,,
207,0.97,1047.112,1053.585,Hi friends on the land use and neighborhoods committee of the Seattle city council.,42,,
208,0.97,1053.585,1059.091,I'm talking today about the exceptional tree directors rule 13-2020.,42,,
209,0.97,1059.091,1066.598,And I just wanted to point out that the urban forest management plan is two years Overdate.,42,,
210,0.97,1066.598,1074.139,There is an item in the COMP plan that says that management plan for trees will be taken and updated every five years.,42,,
211,0.97,1074.139,1075.541,And it has been seven years.,42,,
212,0.97,1075.541,1078.41,So you're kind of in violation of the COMP plan.,42,,
213,0.97,1078.41,1085.15,And that has nothing to do with the Covid that was a Supple years ago when it got stalled.,42,,
214,0.97,1085.15,1107.439,And so the--I think the real issue is that the original urban forest management plan back in 2007 said that we need to have a tree inventory so we know what parts we have before we start throwing parts away.,42,,
215,0.97,1107.439,1117.95,We are currently using this system of aerial photos taken from satellites using radar and other various technologies to find out where trees are located.,42,,
216,0.97,1117.95,1120.786,But it doesn't tell us what kind of shape the tree is in.,42,,
217,0.97,1120.786,1125.257,Therefore we have no idea about how much money to budget for maintenance.,42,,
218,0.97,1125.257,1135.0,And our city staff of course say that it doesn't do any good to know what maintenance is needed since we only have 24 Arborists.,42,,
219,0.97,1135.0,1139.137,12 on the park crew and 12 Arborists on the street tree crew.,42,,
220,0.97,1139.137,1148.647,"So, you know, we have about a million and a half trees in this city.",42,,
221,0.97,1148.647,1151.183,And really those 24 staff can't get through the job.,42,,
222,0.97,1151.183,1163.395,And it might be a good idea if we somehow changed over to a contacting system which is far more important and efficient.,42,,
223,0.97,1163.395,1167.199,The staff people are constrained by their Union that they can't actually keep records.,42,,
224,0.97,1167.199,1171.436,It is up to their crew chief to keep records of what trees they prune.,42,,
225,0.97,1171.436,1174.706,And so therefore we have no record of which trees are pruned.,42,,
226,0.97,1174.706,1180.712,In fact we have a public disclosure request right now asking parks which trees are cut down.,42,,
227,0.97,1180.712,1184.85,Parks doesn't know and can't tell us which trees they have cut down in 2019.,42,,
228,0.97,1184.85,1189.521,So I will get back to you when I get --,42,,
229,0.97,1189.521,1190.122,"Thank you, Michael.",43,,
230,0.97,1190.122,1193.125,Always appreciate hearing from you.,43,,
231,0.97,1193.125,1198.797,We do have 11 more public--people signed up for public comment.,43,,
232,0.97,1198.797,1206.805,"And if there's no objection, the public comment will be extended for 12 minutes providing each Speaker has one minute to speak.",43,,
233,0.97,1206.805,1211.677,"And clerk, if you could make that change to the Timer.",43,,
234,0.97,1211.677,1218.984,"Hearing no objection, the public comment is extended for 12 minutes.",43,,

241,0.97,1237.269,1245.944,I'm here to talk about the omnibus and the second one is for the tree protection.,44,,
242,0.97,1245.944,1271.169,"On the omnibus, I want to point out to the people on the Committee on page 4, line 18 it looks like we're not going to be able to sell our back door to private developers.",44,,
243,0.97,1271.169,1274.106,Single-family zoning with this particular cause.,44,,
244,0.97,1274.106,1281.346,"Secondly for tree protection, again, thank you for this revision to the director's rules.",44,,
245,0.97,1281.346,1282.514,I think they're great.,44,,
246,0.97,1282.514,1291.657,"However, the problem the tree removal code of Smc23--or 2511, I'm sorry.",44,,
247,0.97,1291.657,1303.535,"And in there it basically allows as Suzanne grant mentioned before, regardless of the exceptional tree rules they're allowed to take the exceptional trees out.",44,,
248,0.97,1303.535,1309.508,And had reported less than 3% of all exceptional trees were saved during development.,44,,
249,0.97,1309.508,1311.877,This is back in 2017.,44,,
250,0.97,1311.877,1314.046,"And we can do both, development with --",44,,
251,0.97,1314.046,1315.614,"Thank you, David.",45,,
252,0.97,1318.383,1323.422,And please feel free to send us any further comments in writing for the record to reflect.,45,,

254,0.97,1331.63,1331.93,Apologies.,45,,
255,0.97,1331.93,1334.266,I know we know each other.,45,,

265,0.97,1391.056,1401.266,We need more oversight and accountability for tree protection at SBCI and we need an updated tree protection ordinance.,46,,
266,0.97,1401.266,1405.67,Asks legislation for tree protection be submitted for consideration by the Council in 2020.,46,,
267,0.97,1405.67,1412.244,Please don't let this ball drop.,46,,

276,0.97,1434.332,1434.666,Good morning.,48,,
277,0.97,1434.666,1434.9,Hi.,49,,
278,0.97,1434.9,1440.172,I think I need to be in the public hearing for the child care near you initiative.,49,,
279,0.97,1440.172,1440.772,Thank you.,50,,
280,0.97,1440.772,1442.174,We'll make that change.,50,,
281,0.97,1442.174,1442.507,Thank you.,51,,
282,0.97,1442.507,1451.216,"Up next we have Colleen, John Barber still not present, followed by Patrick Taylor and Richard Ellison.",52,,

285,0.97,1454.653,1461.526,If I could Reserve one minute for the child care near you and one for the tree.,53,,
286,0.97,1461.526,1466.164,It is confusing to sign in.,53,,
287,0.97,1466.164,1466.431,Okay.,54,,

290,0.97,1466.932,1472.404,"On trees, thank you for this hearing and the tree ordinance sounds like a great work in progress.",55,,
291,0.97,1472.404,1475.74,I like the idea of the tree permitting software.,55,,
292,0.97,1475.74,1478.477,That could be a great tool for Accessing the trees.,55,,
293,0.97,1478.477,1484.549,It should be made available to the public so if they have questions about tree Removals they can check with the Website.,55,,
294,0.97,1484.549,1489.521,They are the eyes on the trees for us as far as removal.,55,,
295,0.97,1489.521,1492.724,Seattle does need a Hotline for tree removal violations.,55,,
296,0.97,1492.724,1503.869,"Right now no one knows who to call, what can happen and oftentimes exceptional trees are removed on the weekend when no one is home to interview.",55,,
297,0.97,1503.869,1505.837,After the fact is not enough.,55,,
298,0.97,1505.837,1516.848,And Lastly our Portland expert that came to the meeting that you were at in November indicated that the fee in lieu really does not preserve the tree canopy.,55,,
299,0.97,1516.848,1522.554,If used as a last resort the trees should be replaced as much as possible on-site.,55,,
300,0.97,1522.554,1523.688,"Thank you, Colleen.",56,,
301,0.97,1523.688,1530.295,And we look forward to hearing from you again in just a minute.,57,,

313,0.97,1568.733,1572.604,"Richard Ellison, good morning.",60,,
314,0.97,1572.604,1572.871,Hello.,61,,
315,0.97,1572.871,1573.204,Good morning.,61,,
316,0.97,1573.204,1575.106,Thank you.,61,,
317,0.97,1575.106,1578.243,Happy birthday Council member Juarez.,61,,
318,0.97,1578.243,1592.524,I'm here to support Council for 39102 but there needs to be improvements made in the bill and we need to go forward on a new updated tree protection ordinance.,61,,
319,0.97,1592.524,1598.463,City has created the urban forestry committee of experts and professionals to support the city in this process.,61,,
320,0.97,1598.463,1601.967,So the city must utilize them and use their draft tree ordinance.,61,,
321,0.97,1601.967,1608.74,It shouldn't be going to DCI and saying--ignoring this expertise that the city Council has created.,61,,
322,0.97,1608.74,1614.546,I was a member of the urban forest work group from 1997 to the year 2000.,61,,
323,0.97,1614.546,1623.088,"This can has been kicked down the road for a long time, the issue of using incentives and volunteer protection of trees and hoping that the developer will do the right thing.",61,,
324,0.97,1623.088,1628.56,We have heard today that only 3% of the trees of these exceptional trees are being preserved.,61,,
325,0.97,1628.56,1632.597,The way to do it is you have to stop the building of bad design.,61,,
326,0.97,1632.597,1637.502,If it's going to remove a heritage tree an exceptional tree it should not be allowed.,61,,
327,0.97,1637.502,1640.605,The change that needs to be built up not out.,61,,
328,0.97,1640.605,1650.281,Please feel free to E-mail any additional comments and we appreciate hearing from you.,62,,
329,0.97,1650.281,1658.423,"We have matt, Aruna, I don't see you're present.",63,,
330,0.97,1658.423,1658.923,"Matt, good morning.",63,,
331,0.97,1658.923,1659.457,Hi.,64,,
332,0.97,1659.457,1664.162,I attempted to sign up for the tree ordinance and the child care near you.,64,,
333,0.97,1664.162,1667.298,"With regard to the child care near you, I fully support that.",64,,
334,0.97,1667.298,1673.705,"Matt, this is just for tree ordinance right now and then we will come back.",65,,
335,0.97,1673.705,1675.173,Okay.,66,,
336,0.97,1675.173,1675.473,All right.,66,,
337,0.97,1675.473,1675.84,Great.,66,,
338,0.97,1675.84,1681.746,The place for expanding and off setting our tree canopy is in the Right-Of-Way.,66,,
339,0.97,1681.746,1687.819,"Rather than making this about trees versus development, we absolutely need more housing.",66,,
340,0.97,1687.819,1697.796,And so I would encourage the Council to entertain how to make Street trees mandatory as part of a restorative project throughout our city.,66,,
341,0.97,1697.796,1706.871,"It is great for equality, it is great for the environment and it doesn't pit housing against trees.",66,,
342,0.97,1706.871,1709.374,That's it for me.,66,,
343,0.97,1709.374,1711.142,"Thank you, matt.",67,,
344,0.97,1711.142,1713.578,"Aruna, if you are present.",67,,
345,0.97,1713.578,1720.685,"Not seeing you present, we have Martin Westernman and Lastly Phillip.",67,,
346,0.97,1720.685,1722.087,"Martin, good morning.",67,,
347,0.97,1722.087,1723.421,"Thank you, council member Strauss.",68,,

351,0.97,1742.407,1755.019,We also urge the city Council and Mayor to craft an updated tree protection ordinance based on guidelines provided by the urban forestry Commission.,68,,
352,0.97,1755.019,1762.026,"Finally, provide more than $3 billion a year in benefits of savings for our city every year.",68,,
353,0.97,1762.026,1774.672,"City Council appropriated money in the budget to fund a consultant that would work with city departments to integrate capital value into the cost benefit analysis, policy making and operations.",68,,
354,0.97,1774.672,1776.608,Important way to protect trees.,68,,
355,0.97,1776.608,1793.525,"We urge the Council to make sure that $35,000 is spent this Yar for its intended purpose to care for the huge value of the urban forest green and water spaces.",68,,
356,0.97,1793.525,1793.825,Thank you.,68,,
357,0.97,1793.825,1798.863,The love of not hitting Unmute.,69,,

359,0.97,1800.298,1804.369,"And Phillip, take it away.",69,,
360,0.97,1804.369,1806.204,I'm with friends of discovery park.,70,,

367,0.97,1831.095,1832.096,Thank you.,70,,
368,0.97,1832.096,1834.199,"Thank you, Phillip.",71,,
369,0.97,1834.199,1845.21,"And that concludes our public comment for today, July 22nd, 2020 land use and neighborhoods committee.",71,,
370,0.97,1845.21,1852.283,Our first item of business today is a briefing and public hearing for the child care near you legislation.,71,,
371,0.97,1852.283,1859.724,"Noah, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record.",71,,
372,0.97,1859.724,1868.7,An ordinance relating to land use and zoning.,72,,
373,0.97,1868.7,1868.9,Oops.,72,,
374,0.97,1868.9,1871.769,Give me one moment here.,72,,
375,0.97,1871.769,1881.546,This just went away.,72,,
376,0.97,1881.546,1882.547,Sorry about this.,72,,
377,0.97,1882.547,1895.059,Modifying use and development standards to remove regulatory impediments and allow the sighting of child care centers throughout the city and amending sections of the Seattle municipal code.,72,,
378,0.97,1895.059,1895.526,"Thank you, Noah.",73,,
379,0.97,1895.526,1904.535,"Child care is one of the issues that I have heard the most about, whether it was--it is in the community or talking to friends who are new parents.",73,,
380,0.97,1904.535,1917.815,Anyone who has had to go through the process of finding child care in Seattle recently knows how difficult it can be to find child care that is affordable and is near their home.,73,,
381,0.97,1917.815,1925.023,I have heard many stories of people having to go out of town or sign up on wait lists years in advance.,73,,
382,0.97,1925.023,1933.698,"When I took office in January, addressing child care is was--is one of my top priorities.",73,,
383,0.97,1933.698,1940.038,"And in this new Post-Covid world, child care has become an even more important issue in a whole new way.",73,,
384,0.97,1940.038,1943.408,This bill we began working on in January.,73,,
385,0.97,1943.408,1947.912,"And as land use bills take quite some time, we are here today.",73,,
386,0.97,1947.912,1951.683,This bill is not intended to be a single solution.,73,,
387,0.97,1951.683,1961.793,It is one part of a spectrum of things that we need to address to make child care affordable and accessible.,73,,
388,0.97,1961.793,1968.7,As land use chair I'm proposing this legislation as a way to use our land use code to ease and Incentivize child care.,73,,
389,0.97,1968.7,1977.241,"With all of the challenges relate today child care, the land use code should not be an additional barrier.",73,,
390,0.97,1977.241,1984.082,This would not have been possible without Lish Whitson.,73,,
391,0.97,1984.082,1984.615,He is here today.,73,,
392,0.97,1984.615,1988.019,"Lish, will you kick it off.",73,,
393,0.97,1988.019,1988.286,Great.,74,,
394,0.97,1988.286,1992.156,"Thank you, council member.",74,,
395,0.97,1992.156,1992.857,And good morning.,74,,
396,0.97,1992.857,1995.493,Good morning.,75,,
397,0.97,1995.493,1998.162,Let me--sorry.,76,,
398,0.97,1998.162,2003.034,Share my screen.,76,,
399,0.97,2003.034,2003.267,Great.,76,,
400,0.97,2003.267,2020.151,So this is a conference of a piece of legislation that looks at the entire land use code to identify where there are barriers to sighting child care facilities in the city and to address those barriers and remove them where appropriate.,76,,
401,0.97,2020.151,2031.062,I'm going to talk about the current child care regulations both at the state and city levels.,76,,
402,0.97,2031.062,2034.699,Current conditions of child care in Seattle and the proposal.,76,,
403,0.97,2034.699,2038.87,There are two main regulators in Seattle of child care facilities.,76,,
404,0.97,2038.87,2044.642,The bulk of regulations is from Washington State Department of children and families.,76,,
405,0.97,2044.642,2047.478,They deal with issues having to do with health and safe tree.,76,,
406,0.97,2047.478,2055.353,They also deal with issues related to the actual configuration of child care facilities both indoor and outdoor.,76,,
407,0.97,2055.353,2066.964,"Seattle on the other hand regulates business licenses, whether a child care facility is a principal use.",76,,
408,0.97,2066.964,2071.736,And our zoning considers impacts to surrounding neighbors.,76,,
409,0.97,2071.736,2073.805,From child care facilities.,76,,
410,0.97,2073.805,2081.913,It also provides incentives to incorporate child care into new development.,76,,
411,0.97,2081.913,2094.826,It the state has different categories of child care facilities that amass it on to the city regulations.,76,,
412,0.97,2094.826,2103.367,Family home programs are accessory family home based child care facilities.,76,,
413,0.97,2103.367,2108.84,Child care centers are more important self contained child care facilities.,76,,
414,0.97,2108.84,2124.188,And then state law recognizes but doesn't regulate a number of other categories of child care like facilities that are considered child care under Seattle's zoning.,76,,
415,0.97,2124.188,2141.305,"Seattle's child care regulations run the gamut between discouraging child care facility in single-family areas by limiting their size, requiring conditional use approval and allowing appeals of child care facility approvals to the hearing Examiner.",76,,
416,0.97,2141.305,2170.434,"At the other end of the spectrum is downtown Seattle where child care facilities are actively Incentivized through allowing bonuses, allowing and requiring contributions for projects that want to meet maximum height and density and exempting child care facilities from requirements.",76,,
417,0.97,2170.434,2175.84,I'm going to walk briefly through the regulations in a little more detail.,76,,
418,0.97,2175.84,2186.884,"For home occupations which are child care facilities cited within a person's home, there are Fivelimits on number of children.",76,,
419,0.97,2186.884,2194.992,It can only be within the primary dwelling unit.,76,,
420,0.97,2194.992,2207.872,"And except for Ada access, there can be no outdoor evidence of",76,,
421,0.97,2381.212,2409.94,One of the key ones is providing extra Floria for project downtown that either incorporate child care facilities in their project or provide contribution that's are then used to subsidize child care spaces and facilities in other areas of the city.,77,,
422,0.97,2409.94,2414.678,So some of those have been used in downtown projects.,77,,
423,0.97,2414.678,2432.229,"But others have been used to subsidize child care facilities in areas like sand point, Park, Lake city and will be used at the Pacific hospital building North end of",77,,
424,0.97,2450.114,2461.926,People can build a large of a building as they desire without the child care space.,78,,
425,0.97,2466.864,2486.05,That is important as we try to create Denser living opportunities with the record number of individuals having children in Seattle now.,79,,
426,0.97,2486.05,2490.12,I think it is important to Embed that in the core.,79,,
427,0.97,2490.12,2499.83,It is important to Juxtapose that with what you just said where people don't have any evidence of child care.,79,,
428,0.97,2499.83,2500.865,They have to be out of sight.,79,,
429,0.97,2500.865,2516.146,And I think that this is the beginning of a conversation as Council member Strauss as the chair mentioned to all of the changes that are needed so we can truly have downtown play areas and then child care facilities that are accessible.,79,,
430,0.97,2516.146,2526.29,To jobs that really calls for us to act with urgency.,79,,
431,0.97,2526.29,2530.094,I appreciate this conversation.,79,,
432,0.97,2530.094,2552.416,"Looking at the demand for child care and this sort of bears up with chair Strauss mentioned at the beginning, we have about 32,000 households with children under six years of age.",80,,
433,0.97,2552.416,2557.121,All parents or guardians work outside of the home.,80,,
434,0.97,2557.121,2564.662,"So there's about 33,000 children under six who may need child care.",80,,
435,0.97,2564.662,2574.004,"According to the best estimate that I could find, there are 16,400 spaces and 910 child care centers throughout Seattle.",80,,
436,0.97,2574.004,2581.145,So space for about half of those child care children whose parents work outside of the home.,80,,
437,0.97,2581.145,2611.075,This is data from the center for American progress who developed a definition of child care desert which is a census track where more than 50 children under the age of 6 live that doesn't have child care providers or there are so few options that there are three times as many children as licensed child care slots.,80,,
438,0.97,2611.075,2618.782,Half of the Census track meets that.,80,,
439,0.97,2618.782,2620.217,According to their data.,80,,
440,0.97,2620.217,2626.256,We reviewed recently permitted child care centers in the last five years.,80,,
441,0.97,2626.256,2628.325,51 centers received building permits.,80,,
442,0.97,2628.325,2635.866,I'm not going to go over the rest of the slide but I can come back to it if you have questions.,80,,
443,0.97,2635.866,2643.173,But the--what we saw was there was a real impact from the conditional use requirements for single-family zones.,80,,
444,0.97,2643.173,2654.351,It more than doubled the length of review time for a child care facility in the zones.,80,,
445,0.97,2654.351,2659.657,"Lish, just focusing on that last slide, I think this--thank you for this presentation.",81,,
446,0.97,2659.657,2686.65,"I think this slide really highlights a lot of the need for this legislation because we have so many children in our city right now that we need to make sure that child care facilities which also have slim margins, are able to be permitted with a Timeline that is predictable and that they can count on and is consistent.",81,,
447,0.97,2686.65,2692.69,"Just looking across all zones, highlighting it takes about an average of five months for permitting.",81,,
448,0.97,2692.69,2695.325,"In single-family zones, it is 8 months.",81,,
449,0.97,2695.325,2699.363,"And then with where it is permitted outright, it is three months.",81,,
450,0.97,2699.363,2729.059,"When we're also talking about the needs of Sdci and their staff time and the constraints on their staff time for all other issues, whether it is putting forward building permits or protecting trees, we need to understand that their time is limited and that these months--the eight months versus three months in particular is something that very important because it adds cost, time and uncertainty when providing--creating child care facilities.",81,,
451,0.97,2729.059,2741.772,"And if we want to ensure that we have child care facilities near where people live and work, we need to ensure that there is a certainty in their ability to have these child care facilities approved.",81,,
452,0.97,2741.772,2746.443,"Thank you, Lish, for allowing me to speak to that slide.",81,,
453,0.97,2746.443,2747.01,Sure.,82,,
454,0.97,2747.01,2757.921,And I should clarify that child care facilities are allowed outright in single family zones if they're located within another institution.,82,,
455,0.97,2757.921,2775.539,So most of those child care facilities that were permitted outright were located within the city of Seattle recreation center.,82,,
456,0.97,2775.539,2785.849,This is a map using data about where child care centers are located across the city.,82,,
457,0.97,2785.849,2786.817,And compared to density.,82,,
458,0.97,2786.817,2801.465,So there are large packs of low density parts of the city and medium densities parts of the city where they are not accessible to neighboring residents.,82,,
459,0.97,2801.465,2812.643,So this proposal does a number of things to remove barriers to creating new child care centers in the city.,82,,
460,0.97,2812.643,2829.426,"It removes the limit on the number of children in the home occupation, family care center, allowing the state regulations about what the appropriate size of a child care center is to regulate the size of the centers.",82,,
461,0.97,2829.426,2832.062,And allows child care to be an accessory building.,82,,
462,0.97,2832.062,2867.531,"For example, if there without t conditional use requirement one can be located near other institutions or other child care centers.",82,,
463,0.97,2867.531,2873.337,This could result in a number of different child care centers locating on the same block.,82,,
464,0.97,2873.337,2881.211,And that's why the potential impacts of this proposal.,82,,
465,0.97,2881.211,2887.751,"For multi-family zones, it again has a Disbursal requirement.",82,,
466,0.97,2887.751,2901.231,The higher density zones it removes child care from limit areas.,82,,
467,0.97,2901.231,2906.67,Without it Impacting the number of residential units that they could sell.,82,,
468,0.97,2906.67,2914.544,"In commercial zones, it limits the--it removes limits on the maximize size of child care facilities.",82,,
469,0.97,2914.544,2923.086,"I should mention that in the last five years we didn't see any child care facilities that were as large as 25,000 square feet.",82,,
470,0.97,2923.086,2927.991,"The largest was 17,000 square feet.",82,,
471,0.97,2927.991,2933.463,"For Seattle mixed zones, it allows child care at street level along key pedestrian streets.",82,,
472,0.97,2933.463,2951.048,This is something that happens that we provide in some of our Seattle mix zones and our neighborhood commercial zones along pedestrian corridors.,82,,
473,0.97,2951.048,2956.52,And it expands that we apply to Preschools to all child care centers.,82,,
474,0.97,2956.52,2962.125,Just for those who aren't aware of the distinction that I wasn't a couple years ago.,82,,
475,0.97,2962.125,2968.398,Basically it is primarily for four and Five-Year-Olds and it is an early learning program.,82,,
476,0.97,2968.398,2975.772,"It includes early learning programs, child care centers often address younger children.",82,,
477,0.97,2977.674,2980.978,There is still more work to be done.,82,,
478,0.97,2980.978,2992.522,And the office of planning and community development has been working on revisions to the city's incentive programs to make sure that they are modern enough today.,82,,
479,0.97,2992.522,3004.267,The work is still ongoing and it is likely that we will touch the infinite programs that I mentioned in the mixed zone and downtown.,82,,
480,0.97,3004.267,3007.037,Any questions?,82,,
481,0.97,3007.037,3008.538,Vice chair Mosqueda.,83,,
482,0.97,3008.538,3009.94,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",84,,
483,0.97,3009.94,3011.742,Really excited about this proposal not.,84,,
484,0.97,3011.742,3015.979,Thanks again for bringing it forward.,84,,
485,0.97,3015.979,3032.829,"Can you speak or maybe the sponsor can speak to how this strategy would reduce the time that it is taking for child care facilities and Single- family zoning to get permitted, to reduce that 8-Month average processing time?",84,,
486,0.97,3032.829,3033.096,Yeah.,85,,
487,0.97,3033.096,3047.544,"I'll take a first crack and then, Lish, if you want to back me up with the expert subject matter update, just to say it is an additional permit that a child care facility would need to be issued.",86,,
488,0.97,3047.544,3058.121,"This does not remove permitting for the child care facility, rather it is a second step that is not applied to all uses or all zones.",86,,
489,0.97,3058.121,3066.463,"So this is--it is my understanding that a conditional permit adds a fee of about over $3,000.",86,,
490,0.97,3066.463,3072.068,Which covers the first 20 hours of a review.,86,,
491,0.97,3072.068,3075.739,Any additional hours would require $394 per hour.,86,,
492,0.97,3075.739,3081.411,Although I'm not sure about the Quantifiable business costs is what Lish reported to me earlier.,86,,
493,0.97,3081.411,3083.747,"Lish, you are our subject matter expert.",86,,
494,0.97,3083.747,3085.782,Is there other information.,86,,
495,0.97,3085.782,3087.484,Yeah.,87,,
496,0.97,3087.484,3094.391,Most child care centers that have been opened in Seattle open into existing buildings.,87,,
497,0.97,3094.391,3104.734,"So there is actually not a lot of permit review that occurs, other than the conditional use permit.",87,,
498,0.97,3104.734,3123.653,And so that requires both additional work on the child care center operator or property owner to develop additional material about the potential impacts of the child care center.,87,,
499,0.97,3123.653,3136.433,And then--and requires a different level of review of the permits by a whole new team of permit reviewers that Sdci.,87,,
500,0.97,3136.433,3145.942,There's a published notice that includes a Timeline for people to comment on the permit review.,87,,
501,0.97,3145.942,3159.356,"And then if neighbors object, they can appeal it, a decision to the hearing Examiner, which can add probably three to six months to the amount of time that their permit review requires.",87,,
502,0.97,3165.161,3167.297,"Just a follow-up question, Mr. chair.",88,,
503,0.97,3167.297,3167.764,"Yes, please.",89,,
504,0.97,3167.764,3168.665,I'm looking at slide 11.,90,,
505,0.97,3168.665,3174.738,If you could go back to that.,90,,
506,0.97,3174.738,3182.679,"I guess could you reiterate, is there a follow-up legislation that would be needed to address the average 8-Month time to reduce this?",90,,
507,0.97,3182.679,3188.418,Or is that conditional permitting that the chair and you are talking about going to reduce this?,90,,
508,0.97,3188.418,3199.496,"Because I'm concerned about the urgency in which folks need access to child care, given that a lot of people are being asked to continue to work from home in the fall and early 2021.",90,,
509,0.97,3199.496,3204.134,"And more people will probably be looking for child care in their neighborhoods, like I am.",90,,
510,0.97,3204.134,3215.245,"You know, I had planned to bring our Kiddo downtown and have a child care facility right next to the city hall which was ideal and we have been celebrating that we got through the long wait list.",90,,
511,0.97,3215.245,3216.046,And really great facility.,90,,
512,0.97,3216.046,3220.951,"And now that we're working from home, it makes more sense to have child care in our neighborhood.",90,,
513,0.97,3220.951,3226.656,I'm sure a lot of families are in that same situation.,90,,
514,0.97,3226.656,3233.663,"As long as we can protect the essential workers, it would be great to have access to child care.",90,,
515,0.97,3233.663,3237.334,Do you know what that 8 months would be reduced to?,90,,
516,0.97,3237.334,3238.134,No promises.,91,,
517,0.97,3238.134,3269.366,"But I think by removing the conditional use requirements and limits in single-family zones we could probably bring it down to three months for most projects, which will be someone opening a child care center in existing Single- family home which will probably require some life safety improvement like fire Sprinklers that wouldn't require a significant lengthy review.",91,,
518,0.97,3269.366,3271.301,"Thank you, Lish.",92,,
519,0.97,3271.301,3273.136,Council member Pedersen.,93,,
520,0.97,3273.136,3273.97,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",94,,
521,0.97,3273.97,3275.705,And thank you Council member Mosqueda.,94,,
522,0.97,3275.705,3282.812,"I know you've been talking about this issue, you know, and advocating for it for a long time.",94,,
523,0.97,3282.812,3306.97,"So appreciate Council member Strauss carrying the torch on this and helping get this through I want to ask about the intersection with the quality of the child care that is provided and, you know, with children at that young age, that's when their brains are developing rapidly.",94,,
524,0.97,3306.97,3318.048,"So there is Evidence-Based programs show that is really the time that you can make a lifetime impact, positive impact on the child's life.",94,,
525,0.97,3318.048,3330.727,"And so have--are these regulations going to impact quality of the programming and has the Department of education and early learning been consulted on this, since they're the experts on the quality programs.",94,,
526,0.97,3332.729,3333.029,Yeah.,95,,
527,0.97,3333.029,3338.468,That's not something that is regulated through the city zoning.,95,,
528,0.97,3338.468,3352.749,So it is not--this legislation probably won't impact that.,95,,
529,0.97,3359.789,3364.594,So the kind of child care would be more of the child care model.,96,,
530,0.97,3364.594,3378.308,Tell me about the state regulations for that since the state would be then--what I hear you saying is the state would be handling the regulations.,96,,
531,0.97,3378.308,3380.643,Don't they require no more than 12 children in the facility.,96,,
532,0.97,3380.643,3382.946,Correct.,97,,
533,0.97,3382.946,3391.988,"And because they have that limit, there's no reason for the city's zoning regulations to repeat that.",97,,
534,0.97,3391.988,3392.188,Yeah.,97,,
535,0.97,3392.188,3399.529,"For whatever reason they feel that number should be higher or lower, they are best situated to set the number at the right place.",97,,
536,0.97,3399.529,3406.069,And so I don't want to have conflicting zoning regulations to state limits.,97,,
537,0.97,3417.714,3426.589,That limit on is child care providers that provide child care if their home.,98,,
538,0.97,3426.589,3433.63,And they have to more than one teacher in their home in order to get up to that level.,98,,
539,0.97,3433.63,3436.332,And also there are age restrictions.,98,,
540,0.97,3436.332,3449.746,"So you can't have 12 infants in one facility, but you could have 12 Five-Year-Olds.",98,,
541,0.97,3449.746,3450.914,With multiple teachers.,98,,
542,0.97,3450.914,3451.214,Okay.,99,,
543,0.97,3451.214,3472.936,There are limits on child care centers in terms of the size of the rooms and the number of teachers per child and that's how restricts how big or small a child care center must be.,100,,
544,0.97,3472.936,3478.241,And that's written into the permits at the state level for each child care center.,100,,
545,0.97,3478.241,3478.508,Okay.,101,,
546,0.97,3478.508,3494.591,"As I understand it, you know, as we hear about class size Impacting quality of education, we hear about that in the K-12 system because that producing a better learning environment for the children.",101,,
547,0.97,3494.591,3499.562,It is my understanding from the evidence the same is true for preschool and child care.,101,,
548,0.97,3499.562,3501.831,That's why I was sensitive asking this question.,101,,
549,0.97,3501.831,3511.14,And I'll probably check with the Department of education early learning just to see if they have looked at this and are there any red flags from that standpoint.,101,,
550,0.97,3511.14,3515.645,But I appreciate you answering the questions on the spot today at committee.,101,,
551,0.97,3515.645,3518.448,"And as I understand, we're not voting on this today.",101,,
552,0.97,3518.448,3521.718,So there is some time.,101,,
553,0.97,3521.718,3522.118,Yeah.,102,,
554,0.97,3522.118,3522.952,Okay.,103,,
555,0.97,3522.952,3529.392,And the Department of education and early learning were consulted an this.,104,,
556,0.97,3529.392,3531.327,"Oh, they were consulted on it.",105,,
557,0.97,3531.327,3532.562,Yes.,106,,
558,0.97,3532.562,3533.83,I didn't say that.,106,,
559,0.97,3533.83,3534.163,Okay.,107,,
560,0.97,3534.163,3534.397,Great.,107,,
561,0.97,3534.397,3542.338,Was there any information for us that you care to share about that input?,107,,
562,0.97,3542.338,3544.541,That would be helpful.,107,,
563,0.97,3544.541,3547.31,Actually Council member Strauss' office led that.,108,,
564,0.97,3547.31,3567.13,"And because I did not bring that information ahead of me today because we were doing--we are here for a public hearing foremost, unless Noah you have that information in front of you right now, we will circle back with you, council member Pedersen, and we can address it at the next committee meeting, if that's all right.",109,,
565,0.97,3567.13,3568.698,Thank you.,110,,
566,0.97,3568.698,3575.972,"And I see--unless Council member Pedersen if you have another question, I see Council member Mosqueda.",111,,
567,0.97,3575.972,3576.306,I'm good.,112,,
568,0.97,3576.306,3576.606,Thank you.,112,,
569,0.97,3576.606,3577.607,Thank you so much.,113,,
570,0.97,3577.607,3582.912,The way that I understand this legislation is this is really related to permits.,113,,
571,0.97,3582.912,3592.555,"If there was child care facilities that were going to expand, they would still need to comport with the provider child ratio that is in existing statutes.",113,,
572,0.97,3592.555,3599.796,So I don't believe any of those changes would go directly related to do the ratio for the Kiddos to the providers.,113,,
573,0.97,3599.796,3604.367,Is that correct?,113,,
574,0.97,3604.367,3605.068,Correct.,114,,
575,0.97,3605.068,3605.335,Okay.,115,,
576,0.97,3605.335,3613.009,"Because, council member Pedersen, I think your question is if they're going to expand, will they have the teachers necessary for the number of Kiddos.",115,,
577,0.97,3613.009,3620.283,I don't think any of those ratio requirements change under this proposal.,115,,
578,0.97,3620.283,3620.683,"Yes, please.",116,,
579,0.97,3620.683,3622.151,This is a discussion.,116,,
580,0.97,3622.151,3625.388,And that's a good point.,117,,
581,0.97,3625.388,3625.955,The Teacher-Child ratio.,117,,
582,0.97,3625.955,3630.193,There is also the space requirements.,117,,
583,0.97,3630.193,3637.8,Just having the room to have stations set up where kids can be learning and working with each other in groups.,117,,
584,0.97,3637.8,3659.622,"And so if you have a limited square footage and then you're Cramming kids in there and you have extra teachers for the Teacher-Student ratio, that is great but there is the limiting factor of the square footage of the structure and the kids being crammed in there.",117,,
585,0.97,3659.622,3663.159,So that is something that I'm interested in as well.,117,,
586,0.97,3663.159,3665.695,So I'll do research on that.,117,,
587,0.97,3665.695,3665.962,Yes.,118,,
588,0.97,3665.962,3672.535,"And Council member Pedersen, I think that your questions really highlight the need for this bill in particular.",118,,
589,0.97,3672.535,3679.976,Because it is highlighting the fact that we have permitting processes to identify exactly what you're talking about.,118,,
590,0.97,3679.976,3687.016,And then we also have state level rules and laws that are addressing exactly what you're talking about.,118,,
591,0.97,3687.016,3704.3,"And then in the city of Seattle, we have an additional step beyond the typical permitting to address--that creates that additional barrier beyond making sure that we're complying with our city permitting and our state guidelines.",118,,
592,0.97,3704.3,3704.901,There's this extra barrier.,118,,
593,0.97,3704.901,3707.704,And that's what this bill is all about.,118,,
594,0.97,3714.777,3716.579,Any other questions from my colleagues?,119,,
595,0.97,3716.579,3723.052,"I look forward to the future discussion and also, you know, any clarification we can offer on this issue.",120,,
596,0.97,3723.052,3731.027,We know that the ratios are set by Dcyf and they're also square footage requirements by the state.,120,,
597,0.97,3731.027,3737.733,"So even if the expansion were to take place, there's still the square footage requirements that the state has imposed.",120,,
598,0.97,3737.733,3742.338,We know this will continue to involve the Licenser that visit the child care facilities.,120,,
599,0.97,3742.338,3747.376,I don't want folks to get the impression that kids are being crammed into small spaces.,120,,
600,0.97,3747.376,3767.263,"This would allow for more Kiddos to have access to the quality space and providers that are needed across our city, especially as we see fewer people being able to access the excellent facilities that have been encouraged or Incentivized downtown, in my particular, Mr. chair, correct me if I'm wrong.",120,,
601,0.97,3767.263,3783.112,"This would allow us to create similar type incentives for additional child care facilities, especially around the city as we're looking for more options to access high quality child care with the appropriate ratios and square footage requirements in the other part of the city.",120,,
602,0.97,3783.112,3789.585,Looking forward to the discussion and want to applaud you for bringing this forward during this critical time.,120,,
603,0.97,3789.585,3793.289,Thank you vice chair and Council member Pedersen.,121,,
604,0.97,3793.289,3798.06,"This hall Harkens back to how I started the discussion, this is not a single solution.",121,,
605,0.97,3798.06,3816.345,This is just one solution along the spectrum of needed changes to make child Kara Fordable and accessible throughout our city.,121,,
606,0.97,3817.313,3821.117,Any more questions or comments before we open the approximate you can lick comment?,122,,
607,0.97,3821.117,3826.789,"Thank you, Lish, for that overview.",122,,
608,0.97,3826.789,3830.059,And if you could share your screen.,122,,
609,0.97,3830.059,3841.003,"Before we open the remote public hearing, I would ask anyone to be patient as we try to learn the system.",122,,
610,0.97,3841.003,3844.941,We are continuously looking ways to Fine-Tune the process.,122,,
611,0.97,3851.347,3854.817,I will moderate the public hearing as follows.,122,,
612,0.97,3854.817,3856.652,Each Speaker has two minutes to speak.,122,,
613,0.97,3856.652,3858.554,I will call them in order.,122,,
614,0.97,3858.554,3866.162,"If you have not registered to speak but if you would like to, you can sign up before the end of the public hearing by signing up on the Website.",122,,
615,0.97,3866.162,3869.966,This link is included in today's agenda.,122,,
616,0.97,3869.966,3874.971,"Once I call a Speaker's name, staff will Unmute the appropriate microphone.",122,,
617,0.97,3874.971,3878.774,That will be the Cue that it is your turn to speak.,122,,
618,0.97,3878.774,3882.945,Please begin speaking by saying your name and the item that you're addressing.,122,,
619,0.97,3882.945,3886.882,Public comments should be related to the child care near you.,122,,
620,0.97,3886.882,3896.592,"If you have comments not on this agenda which would be the land use omnibus bill, wait for the following public hearing.",122,,
621,0.97,3896.592,3898.594,You can also E-mail my office.,122,,
622,0.97,3898.594,3901.13,Speakers will hear a Chime when 10 seconds is left.,122,,
623,0.97,3901.13,3906.669,Then we ask that you wrap up public comments.,122,,
624,0.97,3906.669,3922.785,"Speakers that do not end by the end of the allotted time, the line will be muted.",122,,
625,0.97,3922.785,3924.453,The public hearing is now open.,122,,
626,0.97,3924.453,3928.557,We will begin with the first Speaker on the list.,122,,
627,0.97,3928.557,3934.73,"And we have one, two, three, four, five speakers present.",122,,
628,0.97,3934.73,3943.105,And a fifth currently not present.,122,,
629,0.97,3943.105,3944.373,Juanita.,122,,
630,0.97,3944.373,3949.445,"I see that you are not present, matt.",122,,
631,0.97,3949.445,3951.28,And welcome your comments.,122,,
632,0.97,3951.28,3954.917,So beginning with Juanita.,122,,
633,0.97,3954.917,3957.553,Please take it away.,122,,
634,0.97,3957.553,3958.521,Yes.,123,,
635,0.97,3958.521,3958.888,Good morning.,123,,
636,0.97,3958.888,3959.188,Thank you.,123,,
637,0.97,3959.188,3959.822,Good morning.,123,,
638,0.97,3959.822,3962.558,I'm went prize community partners.,123,,
639,0.97,3962.558,3968.03,I'm really happy to be here and speak in support of the child care near you proposal.,123,,
640,0.97,3968.03,3975.738,We believe that the changes outlined in the proposal will reap benefits for our early learning community.,123,,
641,0.97,3975.738,3986.649,"Long before Covid pandemic, Seattle was facing child care shortages and families and providers were facing barriers in Accessing quality child care and providing care.",123,,
642,0.97,3986.649,3995.424,We support this proposal because we believe that it will allow more child care centers to open at a time that we are already struggling to stay in business.,123,,
643,0.97,3995.424,4003.466,We believe it will remove potential--potentially cumbersome barriers that are already on tax providers.,123,,
644,0.97,4003.466,4011.374,And we believe that it will create opportunities for children and families to receive care in their home communities.,123,,
645,0.97,4011.374,4018.614,As well as provide the ability for providers to be more innovative in creating centers across the city.,123,,
646,0.97,4018.614,4021.751,We ask that the land use support this proposal moving forward.,123,,
647,0.97,4021.751,4028.758,Thank you for your time today.,123,,
648,0.97,4028.758,4031.027,Thank you.,124,,
649,0.97,4031.027,4041.07,"Next we have Andrew, followed by Mckennedy McKenzie and Colleen.",124,,
650,0.97,4041.07,4044.807,"Andrew, take it away.",124,,
651,0.97,4044.807,4045.041,Hi.,125,,
652,0.97,4045.041,4048.577,My name is--my name is Andrew.,125,,
653,0.97,4048.577,4050.613,I'm with 350 Seattle and green way.,125,,
654,0.97,4050.613,4054.583,And I'm here to support the child care near you ordinance.,125,,
655,0.97,4054.583,4058.754,There are many reasons to support this bill.,125,,
656,0.97,4058.754,4062.491,"First, it helps--when small children can be cared for near home.",125,,
657,0.97,4062.491,4067.063,"For working parents who can't afford a car, it may be essential.",125,,
658,0.97,4067.063,4072.902,Also walking or Biking to the local day care benefits family's health.,125,,
659,0.97,4072.902,4081.11,"Second, it protects existing businesses and provides business opportunities in our communities at a time that we need jobs badly.",125,,
660,0.97,4081.11,4095.024,"Finally, it reduces the amount of vehicle miles traveled, vehicle miles driven in our communities, thereby reducing the pollution and threatens climate devastations.",125,,
661,0.97,4095.024,4098.394,Our society faces many crisis right now.,125,,
662,0.97,4098.394,4107.236,"This helps knit our communities together with local connections, local economies.",125,,
663,0.97,4107.236,4112.641,And thereby brings resilience and strength to our communities.,125,,
664,0.97,4112.641,4120.382,I hope this is followed by changes to foster what is called 15 minute communities.,125,,
665,0.97,4120.382,4123.285,"Thank you, Andrew.",126,,
666,0.97,4123.285,4130.493,"Up next is McKenzie, followed by Colleen and Michelle Hill.",126,,
667,0.97,4130.493,4130.726,Hi.,127,,
668,0.97,4130.726,4133.696,I'm the director at University Temple of children's school.,127,,
669,0.97,4133.696,4139.401,And I'm here in support of the child care near you package.,127,,
670,0.97,4139.401,4143.105,Our child care has been here since 1970.,127,,
671,0.97,4143.105,4146.609,We serve 70 families annually and we have over 500 children on our wait list.,127,,
672,0.97,4146.609,4148.577,I've been here for ten years.,127,,
673,0.97,4148.577,4155.684,In the last six we've been engaged in a relocation project.,127,,
674,0.97,4155.684,4159.889,The Seattle city zoning has been one of the biggest challenges for us.,127,,
675,0.97,4159.889,4166.028,We started our search in commercial real estate because we didn't want to go through the conditional use permitting process.,127,,
676,0.97,4166.028,4174.803,"We were quickly priced out of that market, especially with respect to how much green space is required for child cares.",127,,
677,0.97,4174.803,4175.171,Rightfully so.,127,,
678,0.97,4175.171,4176.372,Kids need to be outside.,127,,
679,0.97,4176.372,4183.612,Much more suitable option for child care than our urban centers.,127,,
680,0.97,4183.612,4188.918,"Providers can find spaces with lots of outdoor space, access to local parks.",127,,
681,0.97,4188.918,4198.894,We can own property instead of making major tenant improvements on spaces that are unwilling to provide long-term leases.,127,,
682,0.97,4198.894,4213.709,We can strengthen our local communities and establish near public elementary school that's would allow more programs to take on some of the need for before and after school care that those institutions are struggling with.,127,,
683,0.97,4213.709,4225.421,Also eliminates school Drop- offs for families with children at different ages.,127,,
684,0.97,4225.421,4237.866,There's no incentive right now for a seller in Seattle to allow a child care to go through a conditional use process because they have 40 other offers on the table.,127,,
685,0.97,4237.866,4242.738,"Even if they were less money, that can close in the 30 days allotted.",127,,
686,0.97,4242.738,4251.58,Honestly three months is too long for this process to really provide success for centers looking to buy.,127,,
687,0.97,4251.58,4262.691,Regardless it is a step in the right direction and we need to be able to permit these institutions outright in all zones across the city.,127,,
688,0.97,4262.691,4263.959,Thank you.,128,,
689,0.97,4263.959,4271.166,Up next is Colleen Mcclear followed by Michelle Hill and matt Hutchins who I'm not seeing present.,128,,
690,0.97,4271.166,4273.602,"Colleen, please take it away.",128,,
691,0.97,4273.602,4273.836,Yes.,129,,
692,0.97,4273.836,4275.838,"Good morning again, Council members.",129,,
693,0.97,4275.838,4281.61,And child care near you has some great elements and it should be expanded to all Disowns of Seattle.,129,,
694,0.97,4281.61,4283.646,And I support it.,129,,
695,0.97,4283.646,4287.082,I've got a 27-Year experience in children ages three months to six years.,129,,
696,0.97,4287.082,4290.919,I know how they live and work and how they learn.,129,,
697,0.97,4290.919,4295.124,"And, you know, the trick I see about this legislation is only two.",129,,
698,0.97,4295.124,4298.093,It is where the home family centers are.,129,,
699,0.97,4298.093,4305.668,Removing the limit on the number of children to be inconsistent with the state regulations doesn't neighboring any sense.,129,,
700,0.97,4305.668,4315.844,Why would we permit more children to be allowed in that zone in a single-family area if indeed that really isn't consistent with the amount of coverage that the children will get.,129,,
701,0.97,4315.844,4330.626,"A couple of reasons is the children really do need adequate and safe space for learning inside and outside, setting up play stations, taking a nap, finding a cozy corner to read a book when they have downtime.",129,,
702,0.97,4330.626,4332.094,Also the staff needs breaks.,129,,
703,0.97,4332.094,4334.897,And so the staffing can be stretched a little bit.,129,,
704,0.97,4334.897,4340.936,"If there is more than 12 children, you might have one watching the children and the other one is taking a break.",129,,
705,0.97,4340.936,4345.574,More than that it is hard to manage more than 12.,129,,
706,0.97,4345.574,4347.976,The children's safety is the most important thing.,129,,
707,0.97,4347.976,4354.85,Because kids in too small of a space can get more aggressive or can turn Inwards.,129,,
708,0.97,4354.85,4358.821,So we have to pay attention to that and limit the number of children in one space.,129,,
709,0.97,4358.821,4361.824,The other part is emergency and evacuation.,129,,
710,0.97,4361.824,4362.758,I lived through an earthquake.,129,,
711,0.97,4362.758,4366.362,We had 16 children and three teachers and most of their parents were there.,129,,
712,0.97,4366.362,4368.03,That was a big deal.,129,,
713,0.97,4368.03,4374.203,With he have to make sure that the state regulations and the city regulations concur with that.,129,,
714,0.97,4374.203,4384.613,The last statement I would make is having--operating a separate building in addition to another one maybe a primary building could be confusing to children.,129,,
715,0.97,4384.613,4389.151,"They can wander between staffing gets short, you can start splitting staff.",129,,
716,0.97,4389.151,4394.022,Thank you.,129,,
717,0.97,4394.022,4394.456,"Thanks, Colleen.",130,,
718,0.97,4394.456,4395.791,Michelle Hill.,130,,
719,0.97,4395.791,4399.561,"And if matt Hutchins is present, please make yourself known.",130,,
720,0.97,4399.561,4401.096,"Michelle, good morning.",130,,
721,0.97,4401.096,4402.865,And take it away.,130,,
722,0.97,4402.865,4404.7,"Good morning, Council members.",131,,
723,0.97,4404.7,4407.069,My name is Michelle Hill.,131,,
724,0.97,4407.069,4409.138,I'm a Seattle resident and an architect.,131,,
725,0.97,4409.138,4413.275,I strongly support the child care near you proposal.,131,,
726,0.97,4413.275,4421.75,As an architect with many day care clients I see the additional time and cost involved in the conditional use process.,131,,
727,0.97,4421.75,4429.658,My clients often look for existing buildings to occupy because it is easier to do that rather than build new.,131,,
728,0.97,4429.658,4439.435,It address 6-18 months to the permitting Timeline and thousands to the budget that contributes to the continued short supply of day cares in the city.,131,,
729,0.97,4439.435,4444.807,The state has specific regulations regarding the number of children allowed in a Fay Silt.,131,,
730,0.97,4444.807,4452.915,There's no use for the land use code to be more restrictive than the existing rules.,131,,
731,0.97,4452.915,4458.754,Whether or not they're expanding the front of the facility have to actually go through the conditional use process again.,131,,
732,0.97,4458.754,4464.86,There is no current way for there to be an amid to Upperment to an additional--an existing conditional use.,131,,
733,0.97,4464.86,4473.202,Two recent project that's I have worked on for example proposed a modest five to ten kid expansion.,131,,
734,0.97,4473.202,4481.91,"They faced an added $15,000 in engineering fees and $15,000 in fees and took an additional 12 months to get through the process.",131,,
735,0.97,4481.91,4487.95,That's on top of the construction cost and the cost for the construction permits itself.,131,,
736,0.97,4487.95,4502.431,It is not uncommon to be uncertain about the final--which is why sometimes the land use process actually allows for a different number of kids than what the state is saying they can do.,131,,
737,0.97,4502.431,4510.472,"And as I said, since there's no process to amend an existing conditional use they have to go through the process a second time.",131,,
738,0.97,4510.472,4517.98,Enabling affordable child care is a necessity for the city trying to remain to low and medium income families.,131,,
739,0.97,4517.98,4526.288,This is a necessary step and common sense step to provide child care in the city of Seattle.,131,,
740,0.97,4526.288,4527.289,Thank you.,131,,
741,0.97,4527.289,4528.957,"Thank you, Michelle.",132,,
742,0.97,4528.957,4531.059,"And it, do we have matt Hutchins?",132,,
743,0.97,4531.059,4534.463,I'm still seeing him listed as not present.,132,,
744,0.97,4534.463,4539.501,Negative.,133,,
745,0.97,4539.501,4545.374,Thank you.,134,,
746,0.97,4545.374,4546.808,That was our last Speaker.,134,,

752,0.97,4572.968,4574.336,Council bill 119835.,136,,

756,0.97,4603.365,4607.169,"Will you get us started, gentlemen.",137,,
757,0.97,4607.169,4607.769,Sure.,138,,
758,0.97,4607.769,4608.704,This is Ketil Freeman.,138,,
759,0.97,4608.704,4609.271,Council central staff.,138,,
760,0.97,4609.271,4628.657,"As you mentioned this is the annual or every year, every two years, the Council considers a land use code bill that collects administrative to the code that have been identified during the course of our permitting projects.",138,,
761,0.97,4628.657,4630.726,This is the 2019 omnibus.,138,,
762,0.97,4630.726,4632.627,We're considering it now in 2020.,138,,
763,0.97,4632.627,4634.129,Just a word on process.,138,,
764,0.97,4634.129,4638.467,Today it is an initial briefing and public hearing.,138,,
765,0.97,4638.467,4640.802,This will be back in Committee on August 12th.,138,,
766,0.97,4640.802,4645.04,With that I will turn it over to Mike Podowski.,138,,
767,0.97,4645.04,4646.641,"Thank you, coat I will and committee members.",139,,
768,0.97,4646.641,4651.68,Thank you for your consideration of this legislation.,139,,
769,0.97,4651.68,4656.251,"As Ketil mentioned, we put forward omnibus proposals on a regular cycle.",139,,
770,0.97,4656.251,4662.958,"It is a good government, good regulatory agency practice that is recommended by the state growth management officials.",139,,
771,0.97,4662.958,4668.163,We've been producing them since Te mid 1990s.,139,,
772,0.97,4668.163,4673.902,And I have to say that it's--it addresses a range of topics.,139,,
773,0.97,4673.902,4677.272,"Isocetyl mentioned, there are corrections and Clarifications.",139,,
774,0.97,4677.272,4683.779,Also some minor policy changes that don't warrant independent legislation on their own.,139,,
775,0.97,4683.779,4689.751,But they thought they were important to bring to your attention Foreconsideration.,139,,
776,0.97,4689.751,4691.887,There are approximately 57 amendments in this bill.,139,,
777,0.97,4691.887,4694.122,"Largely they're in title 23, the land use code.",139,,
778,0.97,4694.122,4704.132,But there are also a few amendments related to the building code and also rental housing and inspection programs.,139,,
779,0.97,4704.132,4711.306,I was going to just point out one topic of the land use code that is in our proposal.,139,,
780,0.97,4711.306,4713.542,As you may have gotten correspondence on.,139,,
781,0.97,4713.542,4720.482,And we may hear some testimony here in a few minutes related to bike parking requirements.,139,,
782,0.97,4720.482,4728.39,The city council last year or maybe 18 months ago adopted new progressive bike parking standards.,139,,
783,0.97,4728.39,4739.234,And we have identified with permit applicants and housing providers some Tweaks that we would like you to consider to help us interpret and administer the rules.,139,,
784,0.97,4739.234,4745.574,"Just at a high level, there are three amendments.",139,,
785,0.97,4745.574,4749.01,One that's to do with pathways on sloping sites.,139,,
786,0.97,4749.01,4754.783,You can't have stairs on these pathways.,139,,
787,0.97,4754.783,4760.922,We're propose to allow for that to be done.,139,,
788,0.97,4760.922,4761.49,Short term parking.,139,,
789,0.97,4761.49,4767.863,We're proposing it be placed in the Right-Of-Way with staff's approval.,139,,
790,0.97,4767.863,4771.566,And it is easy to find and convenient.,139,,
791,0.97,4771.566,4782.21,And finally we're proposing some flexibility for affordable housing providers.,139,,
792,0.97,4782.21,4786.381,Focused on the residents and the population they intend to serve.,139,,
793,0.97,4786.381,4789.951,So that's a high level.,139,,
794,0.97,4789.951,4794.556,I'm available for any questions.,139,,
795,0.97,4794.556,4795.157,"Thank you, Mike.",140,,
796,0.97,4795.157,4809.971,And I have also heard the concerns from some community members about the changes related to bike parking and affordable housing and care facility.,140,,
797,0.97,4809.971,4816.978,"With the budget and everything that we need to be focused on, I have not fully addressed the issues and the questions yet.",140,,
798,0.97,4816.978,4819.881,I'm hoping to continue this conversation.,140,,
799,0.97,4819.881,4824.452,Work with you Sdci and Stakeholders to find a solution that works for everyone on bike parking.,140,,
800,0.97,4824.452,4826.788,Thank you for that briefing.,140,,
801,0.97,4826.788,4832.394,"Colleagues, any other questions for my colleagues?",140,,
802,0.97,4832.394,4836.131,"Mr. chair, council member Lewis here.",141,,
803,0.97,4836.131,4836.998,Yes.,142,,
804,0.97,4836.998,4837.866,Go for it.,142,,
805,0.97,4837.866,4840.635,I saw vice chair Mosqueda's hand but you're on the phone.,142,,
806,0.97,4840.635,4843.104,Go inform it Council member Lewis.,142,,
807,0.97,4843.104,4844.339,I'll be brief.,143,,
808,0.97,4844.339,4846.875,Not a question.,143,,
809,0.97,4846.875,4870.899,Just a statement saying totally support giving more flexibility to our permanent supportive housing developer friends who have told me very frequently through the third door process and through other chances I've had to talk to them about ways we as a city can be a better partner to stream line cost.,143,,
810,0.97,4870.899,4876.504,The bike storage requirements in particular have been something that they have regularly brought up.,143,,
811,0.97,4876.504,4897.225,"And, you know, I really appreciate the opportunity to pursue these changes and see if that can expedite the construction of permanent supportive housing and also perhaps factor into our accounting to reduce the per unit cost of that--of those housing options.",143,,
812,0.97,4897.225,4907.836,And I just look forward to continuing that work and just wanted to highlight that I'm glad we're going forward on that.,143,,
813,0.97,4907.836,4917.979,And that work is essential as we seek to scale up permanent supportive housing regionally as part of our response to chronic homelessness.,143,,
814,0.97,4917.979,4924.052,"Thank you, council member Lewis.",144,,
815,0.97,4924.052,4925.587,Vice chair Mosqueda.,144,,
816,0.97,4925.587,4925.787,Nope.,144,,
817,0.97,4925.787,4927.956,No questions from vice chair.,144,,
818,0.97,4927.956,4930.091,Thank you kindly.,144,,
819,0.97,4930.091,4936.698,Hearing and seeing no further questions from my colleagues.,144,,
820,0.97,4936.698,4937.632,Actually--yes.,145,,
821,0.97,4937.632,4938.366,I'm sorry.,145,,
822,0.97,4938.366,4939.935,I Texted but I wasn't quick enough.,145,,
823,0.97,4939.935,4952.781,Is this the time that you want us to comment on the bill or are you going to have comments at the end or is this the time to make a few comments within the director's report and everything else?,145,,
824,0.97,4952.781,4953.882,I see your text now.,146,,
825,0.97,4953.882,4958.219,I would say take your comments away.,146,,
826,0.97,4958.219,4958.486,Okay.,147,,
827,0.97,4958.486,4958.887,"Well, thank you.",147,,
828,0.97,4958.887,4962.324,Did you see I sent you a little picture too.,147,,
829,0.97,4962.324,4962.691,I did.,148,,
830,0.97,4962.691,4966.127,That's--your handwriting is better than mine.,148,,
831,0.97,4966.127,4968.096,Let me just say this.,149,,
832,0.97,4968.096,4970.198,"I know--and thank you, Ketil.",149,,
833,0.97,4970.198,4978.34,I'm sure we didn't all get a chance to go through all 57 amendments in the bill.,149,,
834,0.97,4978.34,4980.909,The administrative fix is putting it mildly.,149,,
835,0.97,4980.909,4981.843,There say lot there.,149,,
836,0.97,4981.843,4987.148,"I want to thank the director--the director's report, 19 pages.",149,,
837,0.97,4987.148,4990.085,Specifically there are two quick items.,149,,
838,0.97,4990.085,5009.17,"On page 16 to the director's report in regards to Biking parking requirements, I am particularly happy because our district, District 5 has the highest number of Elders and we don't have an elder center.",149,,
839,0.97,5009.17,5016.611,"Two years ago we passed, thank you, Ketil, Upzones to help the elder community up here.",149,,
840,0.97,5016.611,5026.788,The North gate neighborhood is fortunate to have North gate and we've met with and visited many of the Elders there and met with their leadership about what they need.,149,,
841,0.97,5026.788,5040.235,"Many of the seniors that live in North haven, it is a resident Betial building across from the North gate mall has 196 studio one bedroom independent units for low income Elders.",149,,
842,0.97,5040.235,5047.609,"In addition to the expansion that we hope to do for more low income seniors, they also have on-site medical services.",149,,
843,0.97,5047.609,5055.316,This is becoming a highly developed area as you know because we have light rail coming to North gate and hopefully on 130Th.,149,,
844,0.97,5055.316,5059.854,The Footprint that North haven sits on is incredibly tight.,149,,
845,0.97,5059.854,5064.392,They need that space to serve low income seniors.,149,,
846,0.97,5064.392,5074.069,So having these changes made allows that space to be freed up for the indoor bicycle parking.,149,,
847,0.97,5074.069,5086.448,So we can expand in giving this exception it would enable North haven to provide more space for medical services and housing which will serve Moraledders than would be served by bicycle parking.,149,,
848,0.97,5086.448,5089.384,So I don't know if it is on page 15 or 16.,149,,
849,0.97,5089.384,5089.818,I can't remember.,149,,
850,0.97,5089.818,5090.985,It is one of the two.,149,,
851,0.97,5090.985,5093.154,It is in the weeds there kind of.,149,,
852,0.97,5093.154,5093.721,That is important.,149,,
853,0.97,5093.721,5099.961,And I want you to know and thank you that it will mean a lot to the folks that live at North haven.,149,,
854,0.97,5099.961,5109.537,"And is this the time that you would like me, chair, to briefly talk about the tree protection.",149,,
855,0.97,5109.537,5114.809,We will get to tree protection in the next agenda item.,150,,
856,0.97,5114.809,5115.477,I'm sorry.,151,,
857,0.97,5115.477,5116.01,Wrong one.,151,,
858,0.97,5116.01,5116.344,Wrong notes.,151,,
859,0.97,5116.344,5116.544,Okay.,151,,
860,0.97,5116.544,5119.647,That's all I wanted to share.,151,,
861,0.97,5119.647,5120.381,"And, again, thank you.",151,,
862,0.97,5120.381,5122.25,And thank everybody who called in.,151,,
863,0.97,5122.25,5124.619,And all of you who wished me happy birthday.,151,,
864,0.97,5124.619,5126.354,That really meant a lot to me.,151,,
865,0.97,5126.354,5126.855,Thank you.,151,,
866,0.97,5126.855,5127.122,Yes.,152,,
867,0.97,5127.122,5131.259,Looking forward to hearing from you in just a moment.,152,,
868,0.97,5131.259,5134.162,"Colleagues, any further--I do see two more.",152,,
869,0.97,5134.162,5136.531,Vice chair Mosqueda and Council member Pedersen.,152,,
870,0.97,5136.531,5136.764,Please.,152,,
871,0.97,5136.764,5137.332,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",153,,
872,0.97,5137.332,5140.101,I know that this is just for discussion today.,153,,
873,0.97,5140.101,5151.98,And we're going to be having ongoing conversations with the chair and with central staff about possible amendments.,153,,
874,0.97,5151.98,5154.315,And a follow-up from ideas we had last year.,153,,
875,0.97,5154.315,5165.793,Number one trying to make sure that we're doing all we can to follow will you on the language we passed last year to allow for rooftops to be considered as parted of construction.,153,,
876,0.97,5165.793,5175.069,"That is more people live in the dense area, they have things like rooftops that will be their Patios and their backyards to accommodate greater density.",153,,
877,0.97,5175.069,5178.54,And I think more Liveability in our community.,153,,
878,0.97,5178.54,5199.527,"And then looking forward to talking with you, Mr. chair, about how we do some of the rounding up calculations that also make it possible for us to marry our desire that factors well with architects and those constructing Denser living facilities across our city.",153,,
879,0.97,5199.527,5201.262,Looking forward to that conversation.,153,,
880,0.97,5201.262,5204.532,If you could remind me when the final vote is on this.,153,,
881,0.97,5204.532,5206.434,"We will--thank you, vice chair.",154,,
882,0.97,5206.434,5209.404,We will be taking this back up in Committee on August 12th.,154,,
883,0.97,5209.404,5216.444,And I will have to look to my colleagues to know whether we will have a possible vote that day.,154,,
884,0.97,5216.444,5216.878,Okay.,155,,
885,0.97,5216.878,5218.913,"Yes, that would be a possible vote.",156,,
886,0.97,5218.913,5222.05,Great.,157,,
887,0.97,5222.05,5223.785,So between now and August 12th.,157,,
888,0.97,5223.785,5225.587,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",158,,
889,0.97,5225.587,5226.588,Yes.,159,,
890,0.97,5226.588,5227.121,Council member Pedersen.,159,,
891,0.97,5227.121,5229.324,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",160,,
892,0.97,5229.324,5233.261,And thanks for clarifying appropriate time to ask questions on this.,160,,
893,0.97,5233.261,5247.041,"So this is--my question is about the director's report, page 2. at the top.",160,,
894,0.97,5247.041,5258.019,In the middle of that paragraph it says some disagreement has occurred about whether unit lots must contain dwelling units or maybe set aside as open space.,160,,
895,0.97,5258.019,5266.828,Can you talk a little bit about what that disagreement is?,160,,
896,0.97,5266.828,5270.632,I would be happy to.,161,,
897,0.97,5270.632,5274.902,It is generally between permit applicants and zoning review staff.,161,,
898,0.97,5274.902,5287.148,It is the type of thing that we usually bring forward as a clarification in order to sort of prevent this lack of clarity from going forward so we can make quicker decisions and people can expect what to see.,161,,
899,0.97,5287.148,5297.525,I think we heard in the testimony that someone was concerned that we were newly allowing backyard cottages to be unit lot subdivisions for ownership.,161,,
900,0.97,5297.525,5303.364,That was actually an action that Council took up a year and a half with cottage legislation.,161,,
901,0.97,5303.364,5312.974,It is consistent with prior practices where people were able to own a backyard cottage.,161,,
902,0.97,5312.974,5322.15,This particular provision has to do with unit lots that would be created and would not contain a dwelling unit.,161,,
903,0.97,5322.15,5325.019,Things like swimming pools and surface parking spots.,161,,
904,0.97,5325.019,5331.459,The idea is to allow people to own those things as a town house or row House development without a row House being in there.,161,,
905,0.97,5331.459,5336.898,It comes up from time to time.,161,,
906,0.97,5336.898,5349.243,So would this legislation be allowing detached accessory dwelling units to be sold to a different owner or was that already allowed.,162,,
907,0.97,5349.243,5350.978,That is already allowed.,163,,
908,0.97,5350.978,5354.315,From that legislation from a year and a half ago.,164,,
909,0.97,5354.315,5354.549,Yes.,165,,
910,0.97,5354.549,5355.183,Pools and parking spaces.,165,,
911,0.97,5355.183,5356.617,Okay.,166,,
912,0.97,5356.617,5375.67,"And then in terms of the bike parking issue that has been discussed by a couple of my colleagues, it's my understanding--I mean, one of the Rationals encouraging Cycling, it is affordable, it is clean for the environment.",166,,
913,0.97,5375.67,5393.387,Do we have any data on the low income housing projects that we have already and the bicycle use in terms of whether we would want to--for them to have those benefits of having the bike parking on-site there?,166,,
914,0.97,5393.387,5399.527,"Well, the request in this--the request comes from the office of housing.",167,,
915,0.97,5399.527,5413.941,And their funding group that issues the--there's approximately 12 projects that are in the pipeline right now.,167,,
916,0.97,5413.941,5418.179,Seniors and those with physical and mental disabilities.,167,,
917,0.97,5418.179,5423.985,It displaces space that would otherwise be used for services and other amenities that these people need.,167,,
918,0.97,5423.985,5432.76,I don't think that anyone at Sdci or the office of housing feels that there are not benefits so allowing certain people to bike.,167,,
919,0.97,5432.76,5443.304,But the idea is to give Oh and their partners an ability to partner.,167,,
920,0.97,5443.304,5443.571,Okay.,168,,
921,0.97,5443.571,5444.305,Last follow-up there.,168,,
922,0.97,5444.305,5452.513,"The change in the rule would be applied to all affordable housing, not just those that are set aside for seniors or those with disabilities?",168,,
923,0.97,5452.513,5459.22,We used the definition of affordable housing that already existed in the code for other purposes.,169,,
924,0.97,5459.22,5461.722,We thought that was an appropriate way to go.,169,,
925,0.97,5461.722,5468.029,It identifies housing that is using state or city moneys.,169,,
926,0.97,5468.029,5477.605,And there's an income threshold and also a time period within which the units must remain at that income threshold.,169,,
927,0.97,5477.605,5481.709,"Council member Pedersen, that income threshold is 60% of AMI.",170,,
928,0.97,5481.709,5486.414,And that time period is 50 years.,170,,
929,0.97,5486.414,5486.681,Okay.,171,,
930,0.97,5486.681,5487.882,Thank you.,171,,
931,0.97,5487.882,5497.058,I just wanted to clarify--I heard the about senior housing.,171,,
932,0.97,5497.058,5506.334,I wanted to clarify that it would apply to 6% 0% AMI housing with the 50-year timing.,171,,
933,0.97,5506.334,5507.568,Thanks for clarifying that.,171,,
934,0.97,5507.568,5508.97,I misspoke.,172,,
935,0.97,5508.97,5511.506,"It is 40 years, not 50 years.",172,,
936,0.97,5511.506,5513.007,Mha on my brain here.,172,,
937,0.97,5513.007,5513.841,Okay.,173,,
938,0.97,5513.841,5521.282,I'll check back with you when I'm 90 and see how that is going.,173,,
939,0.97,5521.282,5522.183,Wonderful.,174,,
940,0.97,5522.183,5527.054,Thank you Council member Pedersen.,174,,
941,0.97,5527.054,5528.222,"Colleagues, any further comments?",174,,
942,0.97,5528.222,5528.689,Vice chair Mosqueda.,174,,
943,0.97,5528.689,5535.263,I want to take this opportunity to thank the folks at the liberty Bank building.,175,,
944,0.97,5535.263,5544.538,We had the chance to tour last summer and they showed us the bike parking room and also with a bike repair room as well.,175,,
945,0.97,5544.538,5554.715,And I think it really Dovetails nicely with trying to get folks out of cars and into more multi options to have parking On- site.,175,,
946,0.97,5554.715,5558.92,I'm looking forward to future conversations on that to make sure that we're still doing that.,175,,
947,0.97,5558.92,5560.888,I think it is a great incentive.,175,,
948,0.97,5560.888,5569.764,And I think it also offers great opportunities for us to encourage folks to bike that might not have been able to previously bike in the past.,175,,
949,0.97,5569.764,5587.648,Looking forward to future conversations with folks like the organizations that get folks on to bikes and help make it more of a--more of an accessible option in our city.,175,,
950,0.97,5587.648,5589.216,I think having parking outside is critical.,175,,
951,0.97,5589.216,5594.355,"I look forward to more conversations with that, with our Council colleagues about that.",175,,
952,0.97,5594.355,5597.058,Thank you Council member Pedersen for flagging it.,175,,
953,0.97,5597.058,5606.5,I want to make sure that is it is right size so we can provide the incentive to use bikes and have access to Biking and bike parking.,175,,
954,0.97,5606.5,5607.301,"Thank you, vice chair.",176,,
955,0.97,5607.301,5612.974,You hit the nail on the head right there.,176,,
956,0.97,5612.974,5626.12,"When I began these discussions about senior housing and the need for bike parking, I reminded the folks that I was speaking with that my grandmother used a Three-Wheel bicycle.",176,,
957,0.97,5626.12,5629.19,It wasn't a Trike.,176,,
958,0.97,5629.19,5630.691,It was a Three-Wheel bicycle.,176,,
959,0.97,5630.691,5634.028,That allowed Hadder to stable while riding.,176,,
960,0.97,5634.028,5645.373,"As we consider to see Electrification of bicycles, it will increase people of all ages and abilities to use bikes to get around town.",176,,
961,0.97,5645.373,5649.944,"Any other comments, questions, concerns from my colleagues.",176,,
962,0.97,5649.944,5655.983,I want to say this this old lady is not riding a bike because I can't.,177,,
963,0.97,5655.983,5657.718,So there's that.,177,,
964,0.97,5657.718,5672.8,And I will also let the record reflect that Council member on her electrical bike outpaced me when I was on the electrical bike.,178,,
965,0.97,5672.8,5678.439,"Given the scales, she still beat me.",178,,
966,0.97,5678.439,5684.745,"Hearing no further comments, I will--and thank you, Mike Podowski for the briefing.",178,,
967,0.97,5684.745,5686.747,Thank you Ketil for the briefing.,178,,
968,0.97,5686.747,5691.919,"Before the public hearing, I will remind folks of the process one more time in case anyone is joining us.",178,,
969,0.97,5691.919,5695.489,I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner.,178,,

989,0.97,5789.717,5792.82,"With the Timer on the screen, John, please take it away.",178,,
990,0.97,5792.82,5796.257,Good morning.,178,,
991,0.97,5796.257,5797.124,Good morning.,179,,
992,0.97,5797.124,5800.828,My name is John I'm on the staff of the Seattle planning Commission.,179,,
993,0.97,5800.828,5804.431,I'm here today to speak on behalf of our commissioners.,179,,
994,0.97,5804.431,5817.678,The planning Commission has been briefed by the Seattle Department of construction on the proposed 2019 legislation and we submit the following comments on this legislation for your consideration.,179,,
995,0.97,5817.678,5829.19,"The annual legislation is intended to correct Typographical errors, clarify regulations and make minor amendments to zoning and development regulations.",179,,
996,0.97,5829.19,5838.766,However the draft 2019 legislation broad policy changes to regulations related to bicycle parking requirements that are of concern to the planning Commission.,179,,
997,0.97,5838.766,5851.879,"In 2017 the city council adopted code requirements for bicycle parking, updating the requirements for bike parking in new buildings.",179,,
998,0.97,5851.879,5854.415,These would quadruple rider ship by 2030.,179,,
999,0.97,5854.415,5870.631,"We understand that city Council and Sdci staff refer to strategies implemented by other cities with similar bike Ridership goals such as Portland, San Francisco and Cambridge, Massachusetts in drafting the bike parking requirements.",179,,
1000,0.97,5870.631,5872.766,And the changes are included in the legislation.,179,,
1001,0.97,5872.766,5887.014,The planning Commission believes that several of the new bike parking regulations proposed represent significant policy changes and therefore not appropriate for inclusion in the annual omnibus clean-up legislation.,179,,
1002,0.97,5887.014,5897.825,Of particular concern are revision that's would eliminate requirements for bicycle projects fer seniors or people with disabilities or low income.,179,,
1003,0.97,5897.825,5906.834,These proposed changes involve broad policy questions that warrant the need for deeper consideration and more significant discussion with the relevant Stakeholders.,179,,
1004,0.97,5906.834,5917.978,We encourage the city Council to review those issues that would benefit more substantial policy discussion and Revisit them in a different form than in the omnibus legislation.,179,,
1005,0.97,5917.978,5920.581,Thanks for your attention to these comments.,179,,
1006,0.97,5920.581,5923.083,"Thank you, John.",180,,
1007,0.97,5923.083,5925.386,Next we have Patrick Taylor.,180,,
1008,0.97,5925.386,5929.99,"Reminding Runa and Michael, if you are listening, we still see you listed as not present.",180,,
1009,0.97,5929.99,5933.427,"Patrick, good morning.",180,,
1010,0.97,5933.427,5935.763,Please take it away.,180,,
1011,0.97,5935.763,5935.996,Hi.,181,,
1012,0.97,5935.996,5938.799,I'm Cochair of the Seattle bicycle advisory board.,181,,
1013,0.97,5938.799,5944.405,"I want to thank you Council member Strauss and Noah, staffer, to join us to hear our concerns.",181,,
1014,0.97,5944.405,5956.317,I would like to read from a letter that we sent expressing some of our thoughts on the bill and the proposed changes to bike parking requirements.,181,,
1015,0.97,5956.317,5968.028,While we agree that Seattle needs more affordable housing we think that the proposed changes should be available to all Seattle residents especially low income individuals.,181,,
1016,0.97,5968.028,5975.836,"The proposed changes do not come in line with the equity, climate change or transportation goals and values.",181,,
1017,0.97,5975.836,5984.178,Biking is an affordable and low impact transportation option that is used by people of all demographics in all parts of the city.,181,,
1018,0.97,5984.178,5989.55,As the city builds out its network we expect bicycle use to grow.,181,,
1019,0.97,5989.55,5994.121,Bicycle facilities should be included for all people.,181,,
1020,0.97,5994.121,6003.197,Removing all bike parking requirements from affordable housing projects is a major public policy decision that should not be included in the omnibus bill.,181,,
1021,0.97,6003.197,6007.401,This is a significant departure from the intent of the 2018 legislation.,181,,
1022,0.97,6007.401,6011.405,It is against public policy and has not been Vetted with Stakeholders.,181,,
1023,0.97,6011.405,6022.85,"We believe there are alternative policies to SBCI and city council should consider, including no reduction in minimum bicycle parking.",181,,
1024,0.97,6022.85,6026.954,It can be satisfied in Right-Of- way.,181,,
1025,0.97,6026.954,6030.157,Provide a minimum of Pike parking greater than 0.,181,,
1026,0.97,6030.157,6036.764,Eliminating all bike parking makes the inaccurate assumption that no one will bike.,181,,
1027,0.97,6036.764,6051.979,But providing a minimal amount so people have a safe place to store the bike.,181,,
1028,0.97,6051.979,6064.691,Require type one decisions to thorough--less likely to bike than the general population due to the location of the development or the unique Pysical abilities of the residents.,181,,
1029,0.97,6064.691,6064.992,All right.,181,,
1030,0.97,6064.992,6065.292,Thank you.,181,,
1031,0.97,6065.292,6068.595,Thank you.,182,,
1032,0.97,6068.595,6072.633,It just confirming Aruna and Michael are not present.,183,,
1033,0.97,6072.633,6075.803,That is correct.,184,,
1034,0.97,6075.803,6080.007,Thank you.,185,,
1035,0.97,6080.007,6085.245,That was the last Speaker remotely present to speak at this public hearing.,185,,
1036,0.97,6085.245,6088.849,The public hearing on C B-1 19835 is closed.,185,,
1037,0.97,6088.849,6092.386,Thank you for everyone who provided comment today.,185,,
1038,0.97,6092.386,6100.627,"The bill will be back before this Committee for a vote on Wednesday, August 12th.",185,,
1039,0.97,6100.627,6109.636,"Our third and final item, Noah, will you read this item into the record.",186,,
1040,0.97,6109.636,6119.146,Seattle Department of construction and inspections and office of Sustainability and environment tree protections update.,187,,
1041,0.97,6119.146,6120.247,"Thank you, Noah.",188,,
1042,0.97,6120.247,6131.325,"As a reminder to those viewing at home, this is an update of the second quarterly report on the tree protection work that is--that the committee has received this year.",188,,
1043,0.97,6131.325,6141.201,At our first committee meeting the year a Timeline was laid out that included new director's rule and legislation being transmitted to the Council.,188,,
1044,0.97,6141.201,6143.904,By the end of the year.,188,,
1045,0.97,6143.904,6150.978,These quarterly reports are required by resolution 31902 which I helped author as a staff member.,188,,
1046,0.97,6150.978,6152.613,A lot has changed in the last year.,188,,
1047,0.97,6152.613,6159.253,I want to say that it was a year ago right now that we were working on that.,188,,
1048,0.97,6159.253,6163.056,I wish that we were moving faster.,188,,
1049,0.97,6163.056,6166.994,I think that we all can appreciate Covid has made some changes.,188,,
1050,0.97,6166.994,6175.068,"I know like with Council member Pedersen, we are both wanting to save our trees.",188,,
1051,0.97,6175.068,6185.846,So these quarterly reports are required by resolution.,188,,
1052,0.97,6185.846,6192.452,We are joined by Chanda Emery and Mike Podowski of Sdci.,188,,
1053,0.97,6192.452,6197.691,And Sandra de Bader of the office of Sustainability and environment.,188,,
1054,0.97,6197.691,6205.632,Introduce yourselves and take away your presentation.,188,,
1055,0.97,6205.632,6207.935,Mike Podowski from Sdci.,189,,
1056,0.97,6207.935,6214.775,Sandra pinto de Bader office of Sustainability and environment.,190,,
1057,0.97,6214.775,6217.244,"Chanda Emery, Sdci.",191,,
1058,0.97,6217.244,6229.756,I'm going to start us off with just a quick overview ask then turn it over to Sandra and Chanda that will walk you through the rest of the presentation.,192,,
1059,0.97,6229.756,6238.365,I appreciate that Council members and many in the community are anxious to see us make more progress on our tree protection updates.,192,,
1060,0.97,6238.365,6249.209,I did appreciate a lot of the--what I took as praise that we got in the public hearing portion of--the public comment portion of the meeting today.,192,,
1061,0.97,6249.209,6250.911,"That was helpful, I thought.",192,,
1062,0.97,6250.911,6257.184,"And certainly, you know, not the last of it from us or the tree advocates.",192,,
1063,0.97,6257.184,6262.923,So we're going to start off by talking about our work on the urban forestry master plan.,192,,
1064,0.97,6262.923,6280.54,And I think in particular we want to focus on how we have done work to include and to consider the needs and impacts to black indigenous and people of color ask tell you about the partnerships we have forged with representatives of those groups.,192,,
1065,0.97,6280.54,6289.416,We're going to talk some more about the progress that we've made in meeting the strategies that are called out in the resolution for tree protection updates.,192,,
1066,0.97,6289.416,6309.603,"And in particular, as we talk about going Forwardwith the strategy that's we still have to address--and I appreciate Council member Strauss' recognition of the intervening circumstances that have occurred that have caused us to do as well as we could in making progress so far.",192,,
1067,0.97,6309.603,6320.681,But recognizing that we may need a little more time here.,192,,
1068,0.97,6320.681,6341.902,But we want to Reemphasize to take a hard look at the strategies that are in the resolution and make sure that we're doing the best job that we can in considering the impacts and the needs of communities and do outreach around the upcoming work in culturally relevant ways.,192,,
1069,0.97,6341.902,6349.076,And potentially make some modifications to the strategies or come to Council at our next quarterly report to talk more about that.,192,,
1070,0.97,6349.076,6356.983,With that I will turn it over to Sandra who is going to start with the forestry management plan.,192,,
1071,0.97,6356.983,6357.451,"Thank you, Mike.",193,,
1072,0.97,6357.451,6366.46,We like to start the briefing with setting the context and talking a little bit about the Seattle urban forest.,193,,
1073,0.97,6366.46,6369.129,Trees are fundamental to the character of our city.,193,,
1074,0.97,6369.129,6373.934,We celebrate our reputation as one of the country's greenest cities.,193,,
1075,0.97,6373.934,6380.307,"Trees are helpful to continue our high quality of life, especially as we continue to grow.",193,,
1076,0.97,6380.307,6388.315,There are nine different departments engaged in Seattle's urban Street work.,193,,
1077,0.97,6388.315,6396.356,Each Department brings important expertise and resources to this commitment.,193,,
1078,0.97,6396.356,6399.593,We have representatives from 7 of the departments.,193,,
1079,0.97,6404.264,6415.742,And we collaborate on a regular basis to make sure that we are coordinating and that we're strengthening our urban forestry work citywide.,193,,
1080,0.97,6415.742,6429.489,"I wanted to stress as Mike mentioned in the midst of the current challenge that's Seattle is facing, ose and Sdci have continued to work on our tree regulations.",193,,
1081,0.97,6429.489,6435.228,The urban forest management plan sets the goals and the framework to guide our work.,193,,
1082,0.97,6435.228,6437.664,We began updating this plan in 2018.,193,,
1083,0.97,6437.664,6442.035,"You know, the last time that we updated the plan was 2013.",193,,
1084,0.97,6442.035,6451.178,So we began work in 2018 with a commitment to have a robust inclusive engagement process.,193,,
1085,0.97,6451.178,6464.324,"And to that effect, we engage with communities early on to get their input on goals, strategies and actions of this plan.",193,,
1086,0.97,6464.324,6475.101,"With data, we confirmed that areas where environmental justice communities live tend to have fewer trees.",193,,
1087,0.97,6475.101,6483.543,And this further emphasizes the disproportionate impacts especially during like a public health crisis like the one we're currently facing.,193,,
1088,0.97,6483.543,6488.815,We found that on average we have a 28% candy cover citywide.,193,,
1089,0.97,6488.815,6506.233,"When we look at the Census track where people of color and low income live, we noticed that",193,,
1090,0.97,6573.9,6580.34,"Disabled, Latin X, Native- Americans, senior, South East refugees.",194,,
1091,0.97,6580.34,6595.488,"We also worked with community based organizations such as Chinese information service center, the cleanup coalition.",194,,
1092,0.97,6595.488,6596.623,Restoration training Corps.,194,,
1093,0.97,6596.623,6599.859,We also engaged communities in culturally relevant ways.,194,,
1094,0.97,6599.859,6603.73,"That means in some instances, some engagement was done.",194,,
1095,0.97,6603.73,6605.098,"For example, door to door.",194,,
1096,0.97,6605.098,6613.006,Maybe in other instances it was more of a community meeting typesetting.,194,,
1097,0.97,6613.006,6616.71,And we did this in ten languages.,194,,
1098,0.97,6624.618,6634.427,"So progress to date on the plan update, at this point we have completed the first phase of engagement to produce a first draft.",194,,
1099,0.97,6634.427,6639.332,We brought this draft to the community for report backs.,194,,
1100,0.97,6639.332,6643.803,And currently departments are reviewing the plan.,194,,
1101,0.97,6643.803,6647.107,Next steps will be public input phase.,194,,
1102,0.97,6647.107,6657.984,"We're going to be again emphasizing outreach to communities, the environmental justice committee and other partners in other areas of the city.",194,,
1103,0.97,6657.984,6669.129,We will be Inconcern rating this public input in producing a checklist then produce a final draft of the plan that we will bring to Council in early 2021.,194,,
1104,0.97,6669.129,6674.267,"And with that, we're going to get into the details of tree regulations work.",194,,
1105,0.97,6674.267,6678.171,And I'm going to turn it over to Chanda.,194,,
1106,0.97,6686.046,6690.85,City Council adopted the resolution on September 2019.,195,,
1107,0.97,6690.85,6705.698,"Requesting to explore strategies to protect existing trees, increase tree canopy cover and balance city goals to support future growth and density as provided for in the comprehensive plan.",195,,
1108,0.97,6705.698,6714.207,This resolution also directs to report quarterly to the chair on progress made.,195,,
1109,0.97,6714.207,6717.043,We developed the first quarter report on February 12th of this year.,195,,
1110,0.97,6717.043,6721.981,"At that time we shared the scope, schedule and budget for this work.",195,,
1111,0.97,6721.981,6725.952,And now this year we're continuing to move forward with this work.,195,,
1112,0.97,6725.952,6729.589,Including a robust effort to track trees on private property.,195,,
1113,0.97,6729.589,6739.499,This means that we're documenting all trees greater than six inch diameter at standard height as far back as July 2019.,195,,
1114,0.97,6739.499,6746.406,We continue to work with urban forestry Commission that began in the fall of 2019.,195,,
1115,0.97,6746.406,6752.112,And at that same time we had reviewed the urban forestry Commission recommendations.,195,,
1116,0.97,6752.112,6765.658,"Today as we move forward, it is our intention to make sure that we are centering and Prioritizing communities to provide additional protections to address environmental disparities.",195,,
1117,0.97,6765.658,6767.36,"Next slide, please.",195,,
1118,0.97,6767.36,6777.504,"Over the past few months, Sdci and ose and its partners have been working very hard to improve tree protections as outlined in the resolution.",195,,
1119,0.97,6777.504,6783.309,We have reached a number of milestones including better ways to track tree removal and replacement.,195,,
1120,0.97,6783.309,6789.415,This is a brand-new update in our permit system software for tree actions.,195,,
1121,0.97,6789.415,6805.598,We have Gsi analysts working right now to use a new tree Tracker worksheet to track existing preserve and mitigated trees on private property.,195,,
1122,0.97,6805.598,6808.268,We're being data driven in this work.,195,,
1123,0.97,6808.268,6818.745,"And then we will use that data to monitor the status of these trees, whether those trees are existing, preserved and/or replanted.",195,,
1124,0.97,6818.745,6829.022,We also have developed updates to director's rule 200816 which is the exceptional tree director's rule.,195,,
1125,0.97,6829.022,6830.924,That director 'Rule is 12 years old.,195,,
1126,0.97,6830.924,6841.267,And last week we published a proposed draft rule which would replace the 2008 rule.,195,,
1127,0.97,6841.267,6860.353,"These updates could address several of the strategies such as retaining and expanding the exceptional tree definition, adopting a definition of significant trees and establishing a minimum requirement for tree service providers operating in the city of Seattle.",195,,
1128,0.97,6860.353,6864.724,"Next slide, please.",195,,
1129,0.97,6864.724,6873.433,"As of last fall, we've had four other milestones to report.",195,,
1130,0.97,6873.433,6874.033,Greater permit coordination.,195,,
1131,0.97,6874.033,6882.976,Hired two Arborists to assist in the review of permit applications that involved tree removal and advise on code enforcement cases.,195,,
1132,0.97,6882.976,6892.151,These certified Arborists are key to providing us with high quality tree protection Trainings for our code enforcement staff.,195,,
1133,0.97,6892.151,6894.52,We also have improved education and information.,195,,
1134,0.97,6894.52,6906.266,This includes the web pages and now we have staff cast to update several of the tips based on the urban forestry Commission and deliberations.,195,,
1135,0.97,6906.266,6918.845,"For fee in lieu and tree permit system research, we have worked with the University of Washington specifically a graduate student to complete this research.",195,,
1136,0.97,6918.845,6921.948,Her thesis results will be available this summer.,195,,
1137,0.97,6921.948,6936.93,"For the tree data road map project, Sdci hired a retired city of Seattle it senior analyst to prepare a strategic road map for data acquisition, data maintenance processes, and data systems.",195,,
1138,0.97,6936.93,6945.605,"This work will include a compilation of needs, summary of insights from a best practices survey and specific implementation recommendations.",195,,
1139,0.97,6945.605,6955.014,We expect these Deliverables to be shared in an Executive-Level guidance document by the end of the third quarter.,195,,
1140,0.97,6955.014,6955.448,"Next slide, please.",195,,
1141,0.97,6955.448,6960.219,"As far as our next steps, we will continue to move this important work forward.",195,,
1142,0.97,6960.219,6976.936,This means that we will be evaluating the outstanding strategies identified in the resolution through racial equity lens and we will be ensuring that we are centering and Prioritizing by engaging communities and culturally appropriate ways and in language.,195,,
1143,0.97,6976.936,6988.181,I also want to mention that we will be keeping the committee apprised of the additional progress on our work and it will be available to answer any questions leading up to our third quarter report.,195,,
1144,0.97,6988.181,6997.557,"Over the next month, some of this work will include targeted focus of virtual meetings, Online outreach, engagement to reach residents of Seattle.",195,,
1145,0.97,6997.557,7008.901,And through our efforts we will be making recommendations as we continue to move this forward in an approach that is explicitly rooted in environmental justice.,195,,
1146,0.97,7008.901,7011.07,"Next slide, please.",195,,
1147,0.97,7011.07,7012.238,That concludes our presentation.,195,,
1148,0.97,7012.238,7015.274,We're happy to answer any questions.,195,,
1149,0.97,7015.274,7016.109,"Thank you, Chanda.",196,,
1150,0.97,7016.109,7018.878,I am sure that some of my colleagues will have questions.,196,,
1151,0.97,7018.878,7057.083,"I wanted to--I believe it was slide 8. can you say a little bit more about what you are thinking about, the direction that you're leaning and how we are proceeding forward at this time?",196,,
1152,0.97,7057.083,7057.35,Sure.,197,,
1153,0.97,7057.35,7065.558,"Council member Strauss, yes, there's big changes here or updates.",197,,
1154,0.97,7065.558,7071.33,So the 2008 rule didn't really expand the definition of exceptional trees.,197,,
1155,0.97,7071.33,7084.844,And so this new rule is going to be expanding that to include any tree that has a diameter at standard height of 24 inches or greater.,197,,
1156,0.97,7084.844,7091.117,And it will include all heritage trees and any tree that is part of a tree grove.,197,,
1157,0.97,7091.117,7093.319,This was also further defined.,197,,
1158,0.97,7093.319,7113.673,"And then all trees listed in Table 1. and then in addition, it States that the removal of any stem, root or tree part of an existing exceptional tree, that would make that tree no longer exceptional is not allowed.",197,,
1159,0.97,7113.673,7114.04,Thank you.,198,,
1160,0.97,7114.04,7126.419,And can you say a little more about how we are identifying the DBH for different species of trees.,198,,
1161,0.97,7126.419,7134.293,As we know Maple will grow much faster and wider than a Doug fir.,198,,
1162,0.97,7140.032,7145.071,Bear with me for a second.,198,,
1163,0.97,7145.071,7145.338,Sure.,199,,
1164,0.97,7145.338,7160.486,So the way diameter at standard height is determined is that it's the diameter of a tree trunk measured at four and a half feet above the ground.,200,,
1165,0.97,7160.486,7181.707,"And then it also States that, you know, when there's a branch or like a swelling of a branch that interferes with that measurement at 4 and a half feet above the ground, that diameter is measured at the narrowest point below four and a half feet.",200,,
1166,0.97,7181.707,7183.843,Thank you.,201,,
1167,0.97,7183.843,7184.243,That is helpful.,201,,
1168,0.97,7184.243,7189.448,I'm wondering if we have different rules or definitions for different species of trees?,201,,
1169,0.97,7189.448,7198.658,Is that being taken into consideration or are we using one method for all tree species?,201,,
1170,0.97,7198.658,7201.294,"It is one--Oh, go ahead.",202,,
1171,0.97,7201.294,7201.561,Yeah.,203,,
1172,0.97,7201.561,7204.163,"As Chanda was saying, it is one method.",203,,
1173,0.97,7204.163,7213.773,The subject matter expert that's we have been working with did not bring up the potential alternate approach of having different approaches based on species.,203,,
1174,0.97,7213.773,7226.152,"The rule is out for an extended public comment period right now and we can take that under consideration as well as any other comments that we hear, to see if there are any changes that we should make to the rule.",203,,
1175,0.97,7226.152,7231.991,So the question of having different measurement techniques for different species is something that we will bring back to the group.,203,,
1176,0.97,7231.991,7232.959,Thank you.,204,,
1177,0.97,7232.959,7244.003,And with that are there any regulations or requirements regard the amount of ground soil for trees such as an exceptional tree?,204,,
1178,0.97,7244.003,7246.806,I will let Chanda talk about the details of that.,205,,
1179,0.97,7246.806,7256.716,We have some information that addresses that.,205,,
1180,0.97,7256.716,7256.983,Great.,206,,
1181,0.97,7256.983,7257.283,Thank you.,206,,
1182,0.97,7257.283,7279.038,"Tin the new update there is language in there that says that for replacement trees, there a requirement that we amend or the applicant amend the existing soil conditions prior to installation and planting of the new trees in compliance with current best practices.",207,,
1183,0.97,7279.038,7280.206,Great.,208,,
1184,0.97,7280.206,7283.109,Thank you for that clarification.,208,,
1185,0.97,7283.109,7288.981,Is there a requirement or definition of quantity.,208,,
1186,0.97,7288.981,7290.416,Yes.,209,,
1187,0.97,7290.416,7290.85,That's correct.,209,,
1188,0.97,7290.85,7300.459,There is a requirement for quantity and also adequate spacing for species and location must be appropriate to both the species and the site conditions.,209,,
1189,0.97,7302.795,7304.563,Wonderful.,210,,
1190,0.97,7304.563,7306.298,Thank you for that clarification.,210,,
1191,0.97,7306.298,7309.902,My last question is regarding enforcement.,210,,
1192,0.97,7309.902,7328.854,"Even during this Covid-19 pandemic, we have received a number of tips, questions, submissions of tree Removals that have happened throughout my district at least that were--when we reported them to Sdci, it was in fact not permitted.",210,,
1193,0.97,7328.854,7331.691,Can you speak a little more about enforcement?,210,,
1194,0.97,7331.691,7332.224,How are we doing?,210,,
1195,0.97,7332.224,7340.9,What improvements do we need to make and how can I help you?,210,,
1196,0.97,7340.9,7343.736,Thank you.,211,,
1197,0.97,7343.736,7358.317,"So just recently we had a code enforcement case for a tree penalty amount of $99,510 for a Western red Cedar that was 41 inches.",211,,
1198,0.97,7358.317,7359.151,That was in early June.,211,,
1199,0.97,7359.151,7361.821,In the northeast part of the city.,211,,
1200,0.97,7361.821,7366.459,"And then before that, there was another code enforcement case around $40,000.",211,,
1201,0.97,7366.459,7369.929,I think that's the data that I have right now.,211,,
1202,0.97,7369.929,7374.834,"I don't know if, Mike, you have something to add to that.",211,,
1203,0.97,7374.834,7384.543,"Well, enforcement is an ongoing challenge as Chanda mentions we have had some successes in holding people accountable who have not followed the rules.",212,,
1204,0.97,7384.543,7398.124,We are looking at possibly updating the director's rule in the future to help further strengthen our enforcement group's ability to hold people to account and help people do the right thing.,212,,
1205,0.97,7398.124,7402.161,It is something that we appreciate your interest and attention on and support.,212,,
1206,0.97,7402.161,7411.37,And we will continue looking at that and working with our enforcement team.,212,,
1207,0.97,7411.37,7421.247,Thank you . I do have one more per public comment today in creating mandatory Street trees.,213,,
1208,0.97,7421.247,7434.827,Would that be outside of the jurisdiction of Sdci and something that I would need to bring up with Sdot or is that something that can be addressed through a director's rule or would you need to bring it forward in an ordinance?,213,,
1209,0.97,7434.827,7442.501,This is the type of conversation that I usually have with Sdci in meetings.,213,,
1210,0.97,7442.501,7449.108,"But since we're doing virtual governing here, everyone gets the pleasure of seeing my questions live.",213,,
1211,0.97,7449.108,7456.749,"Not trying to pull--set you up for a fast one here, Mike, if you need to answer me off line.",213,,
1212,0.97,7456.749,7474.4,"Just for starters, as Chanda mentioned in part of her presentation, we do participate in a multi Department--the tree Corps group.",214,,
1213,0.97,7474.4,7481.307,Sdot is a participant and we can raise that issue with them and report back together.,214,,
1214,0.97,7481.307,7482.441,Thank you.,215,,
1215,0.97,7482.441,7485.878,The urban forest Corps team.,216,,
1216,0.97,7485.878,7486.579,Excellent.,217,,
1217,0.97,7486.579,7487.279,"Thank you, Mike.",217,,
1218,0.97,7487.279,7489.515,"Thank you, Chanda and Sandra.",217,,
1219,0.97,7489.515,7491.851,"Colleagues, any further questions?",217,,
1220,0.97,7491.851,7499.058,Calling on Council member Lewis or Juarez since I don't see you since you're on the phone.,217,,
1221,0.97,7499.058,7500.86,"None from me, Mr. chair.",218,,
1222,0.97,7500.86,7502.461,Thank you.,219,,
1223,0.97,7502.461,7506.265,I do see Council member Pedersen.,220,,
1224,0.97,7506.265,7507.766,"Council member Pedersen, take it away.",220,,
1225,0.97,7507.766,7509.068,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",221,,
1226,0.97,7509.068,7511.804,Thank you for your leadership on this.,221,,
1227,0.97,7511.804,7521.28,I know our first meeting together we heard from those who want to make sure that we preserve our tree canopy.,221,,
1228,0.97,7521.28,7523.749,Because it is dwindling as we speak.,221,,
1229,0.97,7523.749,7527.086,And to strengthen the tree ordinance.,221,,
1230,0.97,7527.086,7533.292,So just appreciate these reports and look forward to the actual tree ordinance.,221,,
1231,0.97,7533.292,7534.693,Hopefully sooner rather than later.,221,,
1232,0.97,7534.693,7551.11,"If there's a way to get something before the fall budget process in case we need to allocate dollars to strengthen anything in this regard, I am--I am Leary about the fee in lieu.",221,,
1233,0.97,7551.11,7567.593,"Because when we heard about Portland, Oregon about that, the fee was never high enough to Disincentivize the removal of trees.",221,,
1234,0.97,7567.593,7580.906,I know we put out Department of corrections in a tough spot where they're trying to process applications for real estate development and also enforce this.,221,,
1235,0.97,7580.906,7601.36,Look forward no the ordinance Perhapsseeing a way to bring the office of Sustainability and environment into the enforcement or Sign-Off procedures so that we got somebody accountable for protecting the trees and it is sort of built into the organizational culture to do that.,221,,
1236,0.97,7601.36,7604.063,And I appreciate everybody calling in today.,221,,
1237,0.97,7604.063,7610.769,"I know during all of these virtual meetings, it is hard to keep track of when these reports are coming.",221,,
1238,0.97,7610.769,7618.51,I appreciate everybody taking the time to call in and hold us accountable forgetting this tree ordinance.,221,,
1239,0.97,7618.51,7618.811,Thank you.,221,,
1240,0.97,7618.811,7622.781,"Thank you, council member Pedersen.",222,,
1241,0.97,7622.781,7624.85,I want to highlight these are important updates.,222,,
1242,0.97,7624.85,7634.093,As we heard some of the updates have been made--the last time that the changes were made were 12 years ago.,222,,
1243,0.97,7634.093,7639.665,We have a lot more work to do to protect the tree canopy here in the city.,222,,
1244,0.97,7639.665,7646.705,"As we know, tree Canopies keep our environment cool in the summer and warm in the winter.",222,,
1245,0.97,7646.705,7652.511,And this is important for the health of our entire city.,222,,
1246,0.97,7652.511,7658.517,"Council member Juarez, do I see that you have a question.",222,,
1247,0.97,7658.517,7658.784,Yeah.,223,,
1248,0.97,7658.784,7665.391,"We've been working on these tree issues for, God, since what, 2015.",223,,
1249,0.97,7665.391,7666.859,"Just very briefly, two things.",223,,
1250,0.97,7666.859,7670.696,In district 5 we have Creek and the North and the South fork.,223,,
1251,0.97,7670.696,7674.566,And both of them are salmon bearing streams.,223,,
1252,0.97,7674.566,7681.14,As you know we need the tree canopy in the shade for the salmon to survive.,223,,
1253,0.97,7681.14,7691.05,"As a lawyer for over 33 that represents tribe and rights, I understand like we all do how important it is to have a tree canopy on the shades for the streams.",223,,
1254,0.97,7691.05,7698.257,Not only for the salmon bearing streams but also for the Sustainability and all of the other great stuff that obviously trees provide.,223,,
1255,0.97,7698.257,7704.363,"But having this done and, you know, thanks to the, Quote/Unquote, tree activists.",223,,
1256,0.97,7704.363,7715.074,I remember meeting with their group back in the summer of 2015 when this was an issue for them.,223,,
1257,0.97,7715.074,7716.708,And I think it was Mr. Lempke.,223,,
1258,0.97,7716.708,7719.578,I think Steve is still there.,223,,
1259,0.97,7719.578,7722.014,And I have never forgot their words and passion.,223,,
1260,0.97,7722.014,7735.527,"And the same group of people, including John Lombard who wrote a book about Thorton Creek and also Daylighting all of the creeks up here.",223,,
1261,0.97,7735.527,7741.734,And that's where it stands now is Thorton place which used to be a huge cement parking lot.,223,,
1262,0.97,7741.734,7742.734,And we Daylighted that.,223,,
1263,0.97,7742.734,7743.235,They Daylighted that.,223,,
1264,0.97,7743.235,7744.436,They worked hard on it.,223,,
1265,0.97,7744.436,7748.841,So I just want to keep encouraging and moving forward.,223,,
1266,0.97,7748.841,7758.517,It is--it's wonderful that we have this green new deal and the city Council has embraced it and we have set money aside and we have done resolutions and put it in the budget.,223,,
1267,0.97,7758.517,7768.994,To actually see this starting to come forward with the policy and the statutory authority to support it for Sustainability forever is very heartening.,223,,
1268,0.97,7768.994,7773.098,Thank you to all of you who have worked so hard to do this.,223,,
1269,0.97,7773.098,7777.302,"For some it might seem like a trivial issue, but it is not.",223,,
1270,0.97,7777.302,7777.703,It is important.,223,,
1271,0.97,7777.703,7783.108,Thank you for all of you for doing this.,223,,
1272,0.97,7783.108,7783.942,Thank you.,223,,
1273,0.97,7783.942,7787.112,"Thank you, council member Juarez.",224,,
1274,0.97,7787.112,7791.116,I couldn't have said it better.,224,,
1275,0.97,7791.116,7794.92,"Colleagues, any other questions at this time?",224,,
1276,0.97,7794.92,7796.989,Vice chair Mosqueda.,225,,
1277,0.97,7796.989,7797.956,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",226,,
1278,0.97,7797.956,7807.666,I was hoping that we could go back to the slide that showed the historic red lining that has occurred in the city.,226,,
1279,0.97,7807.666,7815.474,Thank you Sandra for your words as you described the importance of this map and the overlay with which the trees exist.,226,,
1280,0.97,7815.474,7841.366,"I think the presentation as a whole intended to highlight the racist that were embedded in public policy in the past that had prevented people from living in certain areas of the city and also correspondingly had reduced the amount of tree Canopies, especially in communities of color where folks had been only allowed to live.",226,,
1281,0.97,7841.366,7850.175,So excluded from other high opportunity areas is what I took away from the map and the inclusion of this red lining historical document that you have included.,226,,
1282,0.97,7850.175,7853.478,And I think it is really important that we highlight that map.,226,,
1283,0.97,7853.478,7853.979,So thank you.,226,,
1284,0.97,7853.979,7861.653,And I want to thank the folks from the Seattle--I'm forgetting their name right now.,226,,
1285,0.97,7861.653,7865.724,They put out an amazing report last year that highlighted this.,226,,
1286,0.97,7865.724,7867.559,Does anyone know who I'm talking about.,226,,
1287,0.97,7867.559,7868.126,I'm not seeing anyone.,226,,
1288,0.97,7868.126,7870.362,It was on the tip of my tongue.,227,,
1289,0.97,7870.362,7872.197,I apologize for my friends over there.,228,,
1290,0.97,7872.197,7879.238,It is an incredible report that was released in December of 2018 that included this map.,228,,
1291,0.97,7879.238,7890.649,And with it the need for Denser communities across our city and for us to specifically address the Red lining that occurred and the legacy of that racist and historic past.,228,,
1292,0.97,7890.649,7905.964,"As we seek to undo that historic past, trying to ensure that there is greater tree canopy by working with community organizations and leaders as Sandra you mentioned you are endeavoring to do.",228,,
1293,0.97,7905.964,7914.84,I think it is important that we recognize that it wasn't just by coincidence that as--I think there's a bullet that says that people tend to live here.,228,,
1294,0.97,7914.84,7932.357,"Your words were stronger when you talked about how folks are only allowed to live there and by de fact toe the city had in previous public policy not protected trees and not protected the health and well being, especially of community of color folks that lived in the area.",228,,
1295,0.97,7932.357,7953.545,Here we are through public policy trying to undo past practices that have been institutionalized to directly address that historic red lining and the consequences of not having tree Canopies Prioritized and protected throughout the city especially for black and indigenous and people of color.,228,,
1296,0.97,7953.545,7958.05,I appreciate the words that you shared and also for the process that you outlined for us.,228,,
1297,0.97,7958.05,7967.526,Looking forward to future conversation below zero this and really fixing the past public policies that were not rooted in racial justice.,228,,
1298,0.97,7967.526,7975.267,"Thank you, council member Mosqueda.",229,,
1299,0.97,7975.267,7978.904,Very well said.,230,,
1300,0.97,7978.904,7980.739,"Colleagues, any further conversation at this time?",230,,
1301,0.97,7980.739,7994.786,"I want to thank all of our Presenters, Mike, Chanda, Sandra.",230,,
1302,0.97,7994.786,7995.587,We had Lish and Noah.,230,,
1303,0.97,7995.587,7997.956,Thank you all for joining us today.,230,,
1304,0.97,7997.956,8004.062,We continue to work closely with you to pass a strong tree ordinance as soon as possible.,230,,
1305,0.97,8004.062,8007.766,"I look forward to our next committee meeting on Wednesday, August 12th.",230,,
1306,0.97,8007.766,8017.476,With further discussions on the child care near you and the omnibus land use bill.,230,,
1307,0.97,8017.476,8024.583,"With that, unless there any items, this concludes the July 22nd, 2020 --",230,,
1308,0.97,8024.583,8025.083,"Yeah, Mr. chair.",231,,
1309,0.97,8025.083,8025.784,Oh.,232,,
1310,0.97,8025.784,8033.091,Just right in on the--right under the Buzzer.,232,,
1311,0.97,8033.091,8033.358,Yeah.,233,,
1312,0.97,8033.358,8047.105,"Just as long as we're all here, I was just curious, I didn't hear if there has been a report back yet on the--on Sdci setting up a virtual design review.",233,,
1313,0.97,8047.105,8051.576,And I believe that report back had been due in June.,233,,
1314,0.97,8051.576,8055.28,And I just wanted to check in and see if central staff or Mr.,233,,
1315,0.97,8055.28,8057.883,Chair had an update from the Department on that.,233,,
1316,0.97,8057.883,8066.024,Just because that continues to be something that I get a lot of constituent correspondence about and would like to provide an update.,233,,
1317,0.97,8066.024,8076.535,"And when I checked in at the last committee meeting, I had heard from central staff and from the Department that they were still on track for that report back.",233,,
1318,0.97,8076.535,8077.536,But I hadn't heard.,233,,
1319,0.97,8077.536,8083.542,I just wanted to check in and see if there had been a report back.,233,,
1320,0.97,8083.542,8088.113,And if that information might be disseminated to the rest of the committee.,233,,
1321,0.97,8088.113,8090.782,"Thank you, council member Lewis.",234,,
1322,0.97,8090.782,8093.685,I have been asking these questions time and time again.,234,,
1323,0.97,8093.685,8099.391,And so I've been receiving informal briefings.,234,,
1324,0.97,8099.391,8108.467,I understand that the report is overdo for official transmittal and then it might be stuck in a place that is not Sdci.,234,,
1325,0.97,8108.467,8112.637,I want to check in on the correct understanding there.,234,,
1326,0.97,8112.637,8113.472,Can we--sorry.,235,,
1327,0.97,8113.472,8118.71,"We do expect to transmit that report today, in fact.",236,,
1328,0.97,8118.71,8121.012,And so hopefully it will be there soon.,236,,
1329,0.97,8121.012,8123.114,We appreciate your patience with us.,236,,
1330,0.97,8123.114,8125.75,We are on the cusp of delivering that to you.,236,,
1331,0.97,8125.75,8126.985,"Thank you, Mike.",237,,
1332,0.97,8126.985,8141.967,"And Council member Lewis, it is my understanding from my informal briefings that staff has been hired to help facilitate these meetings.",237,,
1333,0.97,8141.967,8151.643,There were technical difficulties and we weren't discussing dense plans or even conversation can be difficult.,237,,
1334,0.97,8151.643,8158.583,"In my town hall last night, again, technical difficulties with virtual meetings continued to persist.",237,,
