182,0.97,1249.848,1260.392,Is there anyone else from prep?,37,,
183,0.97,1264.596,1266.164,We have a few others joining us today.,38,,
184,0.97,1266.164,1273.438,"We have the school President, George Hofbauer with us today, as well as one of the head coaches, Sam Bennett, and one of the student athletes that has used the field as well.",38,,
185,0.97,1273.438,1273.772,Great.,39,,
186,0.97,1273.772,1274.139,Awesome.,39,,
187,0.97,1274.139,1280.912,I will make some introductory remarks in turn this over to the capable Christopher Powell.,39,,
188,0.97,1280.912,1290.722,Thank you for providing the opportunity to come here today to make this presentation.,39,,
189,0.97,1290.722,1293.458,We also want to start out by thanking our partners at Seattle prep.,39,,
190,0.97,1293.458,1311.41,This turned out to be maybe a longer than anticipated process to get through the development of the legislation and negotiations on this.,39,,
191,0.97,1311.41,1321.787,We really want to give hats off to our partners at prep who were patient with us as we did our due diligence on this.,39,,
192,0.97,1321.787,1322.854,This is kind of a repeat.,39,,
193,0.97,1322.854,1337.235,"Seattle prep did this back in 2011 at their own expense, and we are approaching this contract with similar terms and conditions . The agreement as a public benefit requirement, which we will hear about later.",39,,
194,0.97,1337.235,1341.773,Seattle prep will be able to continue to use the playing field during the times and dates outlined in the new agreement.,39,,
195,0.97,1341.773,1354.553,The terms are consistent with existing ASPR policies that allow the Department to establish scheduling priorities to particular sites and return for major facility improvements for other considerations the benefit the public.,39,,
196,0.97,1354.553,1370.769,"It is important to note here that Seattle prep is paying for the synthetic turf drug, and they will also pay for the opportunity to use the field.",39,,
197,0.97,1370.769,1375.574,"So you know, it is a good deal for the city and taxpayers.",39,,
198,0.97,1375.574,1384.516,This bill is an example of one of the fields that is probably in less demand.,39,,
199,0.97,1384.516,1392.724,"It is not big enough for regulation Soccer . on one side of the field, there's probably 40 feet of Peat bog.",39,,
200,0.97,1392.724,1405.203,"This is in a part of Lake Washington, adjacent to Lake Washington, which has become Eutrophic, which means the field is actually sinking.",39,,
201,0.97,1405.203,1406.638,Montlake does not have lights at this location.,39,,
202,0.97,1406.638,1414.179,"However, we are able to schedule the field year-round, limited to seasonal daytime hours.",39,,
203,0.97,1414.179,1424.489,The field schedule at Montlake will be available from 8:30 am to sunset seven days a week.,39,,
204,0.97,1424.489,1432.164,Seattle prep school will use less than half of the hours reserved . that is also a big benefit to the community.,39,,
205,0.97,1432.164,1439.438,I would like to handed over to Christopher Powell to talk about the details of the agreement.,39,,
206,0.97,1439.438,1442.908,"Thank you for that, Christopher.",40,,
207,0.97,1442.908,1448.013,We are talking about the Montlake Playfield.,40,,
208,0.97,1448.013,1463.395,"Right now, it is a synthetic field located at 1618 East Calhoun street . It is near the Montlake community center . As Christopher said, one thing to note about the site is that it is very close to the water.",40,,
209,0.97,1463.395,1468.3,"Because of that, nature is not on our side at this site.",40,,
210,0.97,1468.3,1475.907,There is a Peat bog in the northeast corner that is actively moving.,40,,
211,0.97,1475.907,1487.752,"The main sports scheduled at Montlake would be Lacrosse, football, ultimate Frisbee, and field hockey.",40,,
212,0.97,1487.752,1490.822,"For those sports, typically in a calendar year we will schedule about 1300 hrs.",40,,
213,0.97,1490.822,1499.431,"Of use at the park . of that, Seattle prep is our primary user.",40,,
214,0.97,1499.431,1508.874,"They only use about 38%, which means the 62% of field time left to us is what we are able to use for the community.",40,,
215,0.97,1508.874,1524.222,"With this site being a formerly grass field Pre-2011, before the previous agreement, we were only able to schedule this field about five months per year, which is less than the other graph sites.",40,,
216,0.97,1524.222,1530.161,That is because of the nature of the Wetland and the Peat bog.,40,,
217,0.97,1530.161,1551.016,"With the synthetic going in there, we are able to reserve this field every day of the year, seven days a week, which significantly increases usage, and also lets the community get on that site a lot more for drop in use, as well as youth sports.",40,,
218,0.97,1551.016,1556.955,"Three 2011, Montlake Pre- Playfield was a grass site and often muddy.",40,,
219,0.97,1556.955,1572.737,"With this agreement, between Seattle parks and Seattle prep, a turf was donated by the University of Washington to Seattle prep to be installed at the Montlake Playfield.",40,,
220,0.97,1572.737,1576.041,That is where the original agreement came from as far as getting this field in place.,40,,
221,0.97,1576.041,1580.512,That is the current turf we have down at Montlake.,40,,
222,0.97,1580.512,1592.39,It is still the University of Washington field.,40,,
223,0.97,1594.793,1601.833,"At this point, that field is over 10 years old, which in the life of a synthetic field, typically means it needs to be renovated, but coming to us, it was also used before that.",40,,
224,0.97,1601.833,1604.669,So this field is now worn down and definitely needs to be replaced.,40,,
225,0.97,1604.669,1613.945,"Some of the key terms, this is an extension of an agreement we already have with Seattle prep.",40,,
226,0.97,1613.945,1615.947,Something that has been in place the past 10 years.,40,,
227,0.97,1615.947,1632.163,"For this project, Seattle prep will be paying for all of the planning, design, and construction of the new synthetic turf, which is worn out and needs to be replaced.",40,,
228,0.97,1632.163,1643.708,"Seattle prep will also be paying field use fees for all of the usage, which we will touch on in subsequent slides, as well as this agreement as a public benefit component that the previous agreement did not have.",40,,
229,0.97,1643.708,1650.382,We will go over that more.,40,,
230,0.97,1650.382,1651.383,Some of the conditions here.,40,,
231,0.97,1651.383,1661.826,This would be a 12 year agreement with an option to extend that an additional 12 years.,40,,
232,0.97,1661.826,1664.929,"Again, Seattle prep is paying for the field and all the costs related to construction.",40,,
233,0.97,1664.929,1681.446,"Once the field is installed and everything is ready to go and opened up, the city would be responsible for the maintenance, as we would own the site as well.",40,,
234,0.97,1681.446,1684.816,We would operate all of the field scheduling and getting the community and Seattle prep scheduled.,40,,
235,0.97,1684.816,1700.498,"What Seattle prep gets out of this, besides the synthetic field, is priority usage for what equates to our spring and fall seasons.",40,,
236,0.97,1700.498,1703.535,"That is March 1 through June 15, and then again, August 10 through November 30.",40,,
237,0.97,1703.535,1711.843,They get that field Monday through Friday 3:00 to 5:30 PM.,40,,
238,0.97,1711.843,1716.881,"This is where Seattle prep does almost half of all of its reservations with the city, as far as their sports.",40,,
239,0.97,1716.881,1727.258,They do both Lacrosse and football at this site . They are limited to four Junior Varsity games and four freshman games.,40,,
240,0.97,1727.258,1731.963,"Again, the site is only used for Lacrosse and football for them.",40,,
241,0.97,1731.963,1738.436,It is not big enough for a full regulation Soccer field.,40,,
242,0.97,1738.436,1744.509,"At this time, I would like to handed over to Sam to go over the public benefits.",40,,
243,0.97,1744.509,1749.514,"Thank you, Chris.",41,,
244,0.97,1749.514,1754.219,"Thank you, Council for hearing this today.",41,,
245,0.97,1754.219,1759.357,This is multiple years in the making.,41,,
246,0.97,1759.357,1762.227,It is a big day for us to be in front of you today.,41,,
247,0.97,1762.227,1771.803,"Hopefully, to provide a new field and new space for, not only our students and student athletes, but the community as well.",41,,
248,0.97,1771.803,1789.053,One of the things we're most excited about in this updated agreement is the public benefit that goes beyond the donation of the turf and the continuation of our fees.,41,,
249,0.97,1789.053,1792.457,"And includes work we have already been doing, but now Formalizing it and holding us accountable.",41,,
250,0.97,1792.457,1815.079,"One of the things that fits in our mission is to be active in the community, Partnering with organizations, youth in low income and marginalized neighborhoods, and being able to expose them to opportunities that might not have been available to them otherwise.",41,,
251,0.97,1815.079,1829.994,"One of those prime examples, and I will pass it in a second, some of the work we have done with middle school aged children, exposing them to Lacrosse.",41,,
252,0.97,1829.994,1836.568,Lacrosse has been traditionally a very expensive sport but has not been available to all people within the community.,41,,
253,0.97,1836.568,1854.052,"Through some of her work with schools in the South end specifically and the work with coach Bennett, who is with us today, we have been able to expose students and youth to the sport of Lacrosse through some of the camps we have done.",41,,
254,0.97,1854.052,1873.905,"We have also worked and would like to continue working with Montlake community center, allowing our students at Seattle prep to serve and work with community youth in terms of tutoring and On-Field activities, recreational play, and Non-Sport specific activities as well.",41,,
255,0.97,1873.905,1888.286,One of the benefits of Covid times for us is that it forced us to think outside the box into different work.,41,,
256,0.97,1888.286,1897.462,One of the things we found important with our students was Non-Sports specific training and exercise.,41,,
257,0.97,1897.462,1915.88,"And so, some of that free play were, some of that strengthening and conditioning, speed and agility, all of that, we are looking to build programming to allow us to bring in kids from around the city to free up opportunities with coaches and on this field at Montlake Playfield.",41,,
258,0.97,1915.88,1924.489,I think one of the benefits is to see the work in actuality.,41,,
259,0.97,1924.489,1931.296,"At this time, I will pass it over to Sam Bennett, the head Lacrosse coach, who is also a teacher at our school.",41,,
260,0.97,1931.296,1937.468,With him is one of our student athletes that has benefited from this programming.,41,,
261,0.97,1937.468,1939.804,Thanks.,42,,
262,0.97,1939.804,1960.491,"Over the past three winters, we have been able to run Lacrosse clinics, working with--I used to teach at Seattle Nativity school, a school that exclusively serves low income youth as a free tuition school.",42,,
263,0.97,1960.491,1982.747,"We were able to utilize Seattle prep resources to put on camps over the winter to expose kids from Seattle Nativity, as well as expanding to other Catholic middle schools, as well as other local middle schools and high schools, to expose them to Lacrosse training in partnership with coaches from Bishop Blanchet.",42,,
264,0.97,1982.747,1987.785,It was great to be able to utilize the Montlake space this fall as an easy to get to location.,42,,
265,0.97,1987.785,1993.458,Was available to us in the winter.,42,,
266,0.97,1993.458,1995.993,Nap it was able to coach with us at a number of these camps.,42,,
267,0.97,1995.993,2023.221,We were able to have each year somewhere between 10 and 20 kids consistently coming to camps that lasted eight weeks for about an hour and a half of programming on Saturday mornings . It was a cool opportunity for us to expose Lacrosse to people who otherwise would not have been exposed.,42,,
268,0.97,2023.221,2044.308,"We are just starting to see students come through that program his spent time playing at youth Lacrosse programs with the Seattle Wolfpack play a couple years at the Wolfpack, and now a number are Matriculating into different high schools with the opportunity to come into high school as experienced players.",42,,
269,0.97,2044.308,2050.214,"With the partnership, we worked with the Wolfpack to ensure students have access to gear throughout the time.",42,,
270,0.97,2050.214,2052.216,Lacrosse can be an expensive sport.,42,,
271,0.97,2052.216,2067.331,"So there's been a lot of work done to ensure that there is funding for Lacrosse gear for players who are interested, and to pay their recreational fees as well.",42,,
272,0.97,2067.331,2068.699,Thanks.,42,,
273,0.97,2068.699,2080.445,"Hopefully, that gives a high- level overview of the additional public benefits.",43,,
274,0.97,2080.445,2096.227,"As we move through the 12 years of this agreement, we hope to continue to expand what we are able to do in the community, specifically at Montlake Playfield site.",43,,
275,0.97,2096.227,2097.462,Thank you so much.,44,,
276,0.97,2097.462,2101.766,Thank you also to the parks Department for that helpful overview.,44,,
277,0.97,2101.766,2109.907,"Council colleagues, are there any questions for the panel?",44,,
278,0.97,2109.907,2110.675,Councilmember morale is.,44,,
279,0.97,2110.675,2111.175,Thank you.,45,,
280,0.97,2111.175,2113.244,You mentioned you work with or connected with middle schools.,45,,
281,0.97,2113.244,2120.585,Can you tell me some of the schools and how that connection happens?,45,,
282,0.97,2120.585,2122.22,What does that mean?,45,,
283,0.97,2122.22,2131.729,"Specifically, most of our camp offerings are open to area youth in middle school.",46,,
284,0.97,2131.729,2141.939,There are some rules and regulations in my life regarding what sort of formal partnerships we are able to do with the public schools.,46,,
285,0.97,2141.939,2164.428,"We have done work specifically with some of the private Catholic schools in our area, but most of the camps, such as the one the coach Bennett is recommending are talking about is open to the Nativity school population, as well as any other area middle school aged students.",46,,
286,0.97,2164.428,2167.031,It is more of an age range that a specific school.,46,,
287,0.97,2167.031,2177.041,So you would not allow public schools? But other kids can come if they are middle school age?,47,,
288,0.97,2177.041,2197.094,"Our athletic organization, private schools would have rules around formal partnerships with public middle schools . We can offer programming to students within that age range, but not a formal partnership with a specific school.",48,,
289,0.97,2197.094,2213.611,"I guess what I'm trying to understand is, if the public benefit we're getting in exchange for this is, in part, you are working with students from presumably outside the Montlake community, how are you making connections to students of middle school age who are not part of the community?",49,,
290,0.97,2213.611,2214.845,That's a good question.,50,,
291,0.97,2214.845,2238.369,"A lot of it is through some of our--the name brand of our athletic program, the work we have done at the high school level, the exposure, specifically, the relationship with coach Bennett and youth organizations.",50,,
292,0.97,2238.369,2241.038,"He mentioned the Seattle Wolfpack, his prior work with the Nativity school.",50,,
293,0.97,2241.038,2257.855,"Connections we have built over time . next week, for example, we have youth football camps on that field, not necessarily part of the public benefit, per se, but those are available for anyone to sign up for.",50,,
294,0.97,2257.855,2265.196,"I have a few questions, if that is okay.",51,,
295,0.97,2265.196,2266.664,"Perfectly fine, thank you.",52,,
296,0.97,2266.664,2277.441,"Can you talk a little bit about the 50 hours of public service? What does that look like, and how is that determined?",53,,
297,0.97,2277.441,2284.015,Chris Powell can jump in here.,54,,
298,0.97,2284.015,2297.561,"Traditionally, I think there is a date within the agreement that we present the request for use by a certain time when we will put those public hours in place.",54,,
299,0.97,2297.561,2308.973,"And so, we would request the use of Montlake Playfield within that 50 hour allotment for that eight-week Lacrosse camp, for example.",54,,
300,0.97,2308.973,2323.487,"So that eight weeks, you know, an hour and a half of Lacrosse play Saturday mornings would effectively tally through that 50 hour public benefit.",54,,
301,0.97,2323.487,2325.056,That is correct.,55,,
302,0.97,2325.056,2337.268,"From the Parkside, there would be an annual report provided to us so we can see what programs Seattle prep plans to run to fill those 50 hours for the upcoming year.",55,,
303,0.97,2337.268,2354.051,"I also jump in here and say it, whenever we work with a partner who is offering a public benefit, we like to advertise those public benefits on our Website.",56,,
304,0.97,2354.051,2359.356,That is less of an hour a week for sports programming or camp programming.,57,,
305,0.97,2359.356,2362.993,I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what the benefit is.,57,,
306,0.97,2362.993,2390.921,"I think, really, maybe these are questions for, I don't know if this is for parks or central staff, but I would be interested to know how many agreements we have that are set up in this way to offer reserved access to the fields in exchange for investment.",57,,
307,0.97,2390.921,2402.066,I would also be interested to know what analysis has been done on fields across the city to assess local neighborhood access versus this Prioritized access.,57,,
308,0.97,2402.066,2437.301,"I'm asking this because, I am sure I have said this in this committee before, but down here in the South end, we have a lot of Lincoln students, we have children who don't have great access to some parks, particularly, Georgetown, who don't get access to their neighborhood park because we have private schools that have reserved after school hours and Saturday morning hours.",57,,
309,0.97,2437.301,2472.369,"I will say, I am a little concerned about the extent to which this is a normal practice . in our public parks across the city, I would like to get a better understanding of how many of them are reserved in the after school and Saturday morning hours for outside students to come in even adult Soccer leagues to come in, rather than having our local kids be able to play on a field after school.",57,,
310,0.97,2472.369,2473.204,I will stop there.,57,,
311,0.97,2473.204,2475.639,I feel like I am beating a dead horse with this question.,57,,
312,0.97,2475.639,2482.78,But I like to maybe put in a request for this information to be provided at some point.,57,,
313,0.97,2482.78,2489.52,"Thank you, Councilmember morale is.",58,,
314,0.97,2489.52,2490.354,Does a really good questions.,58,,
315,0.97,2490.354,2499.697,There are a couple of fields in district 7 that have similar relationships with local colleges and private institutions.,58,,
316,0.97,2499.697,2504.401,I would be interested in analysis of that as well.,58,,
317,0.97,2504.401,2510.374,I'm happy to request that from parks and from central staff.,58,,
318,0.97,2510.374,2519.416,Are there any additional questions from Council colleagues?,58,,
319,0.97,2519.416,2520.017,Councilmember Herbold.,58,,
320,0.97,2520.017,2520.417,Thank you.,59,,
321,0.97,2520.417,2530.728,"Pretty much the same line of questioning, but just wanted to get baseline understanding of this public benefit agreement.",59,,
322,0.97,2530.728,2539.937,Is this just a continuation of the current levels of public service under the current Seattle prep SPR agreement?,59,,
323,0.97,2539.937,2542.74,Or is this a change from this agreement?,59,,
324,0.97,2542.74,2549.613,This would be a complete new addition.,60,,
325,0.97,2549.613,2552.983,The current agreement does not include a public benefit piece.,60,,
326,0.97,2552.983,2558.789,It just involves the field and the priority rights for Seattle prep.,60,,
327,0.97,2558.789,2569.066,So this entire public benefits piece now is in addition to the agreement as we are extending it.,60,,
328,0.97,2569.066,2572.903,Something we are looking to get more for the community.,60,,
329,0.97,2572.903,2574.104,"Very helpful, thank you.",61,,
330,0.97,2574.104,2596.961,"I want to echo my interest on the value per hour associated with the public benefit analysis, and the decision that the minimum of 50 public service hours annually is adequate.",61,,
331,0.97,2596.961,2600.564,I would be interested to learn more about how you conclude that number.,61,,
332,0.97,2600.564,2601.599,Appreciate that.,61,,
333,0.97,2601.599,2622.72,"My understanding is that this public benefit requirement is identical, or nearly identical, to what is required of Seattle Academy, which is doing the turf installation at South park.",62,,
334,0.97,2622.72,2624.588,I think that is what we used as the model.,62,,
335,0.97,2624.588,2627.391,That is absolutely right.,63,,
336,0.97,2627.391,2631.295,"In fact, these are not necessarily Cookie-Cutter agreements.",63,,
337,0.97,2631.295,2642.74,What is unique about the South Park agreement is that 90% of the hours are being reserved for community youth.,63,,
338,0.97,2642.74,2655.252,We really try to look at the needs of the individual communities and think about what works best in the public benefit regard for those communities.,63,,
339,0.97,2655.252,2659.323,"That said, we will be happy to go back and provide you with the information you requested.",63,,
340,0.97,2659.323,2661.558,Thank you.,64,,
341,0.97,2661.558,2679.343,"I do want to just underscore, I think this is significantly different than the South Park facility, because of what you just highlighted, superintendent Williams . It is a difference between a 90% community use and 60% community use.",64,,
342,0.97,2679.343,2693.891,It seems like there should be some logic or policy rationale or value of the dollar associated with the city investment.,64,,
343,0.97,2693.891,2703.167,Are there any other questions from colleagues?,65,,
344,0.97,2703.167,2706.003,"Just to clarify, I want to clarify something from the presentation.",65,,
345,0.97,2706.003,2709.273,Councilmember Herbold touched on it.,65,,
346,0.97,2709.273,2724.555,38% of the available hours for the field would be for use of University prep under this agreement.,65,,
347,0.97,2724.555,2728.859,"That component is consistent with what has been in place for the last 10 years, the new addition is the public benefit.",65,,
348,0.97,2728.859,2729.259,Just to clarify.,65,,
349,0.97,2729.259,2732.062,Is that right?,65,,
350,0.97,2732.062,2732.663,Okay.,65,,
351,0.97,2732.663,2740.637,"There wouldn't be that can someone actually, for the record, affirmatively answer that.",65,,
352,0.97,2740.637,2750.314,"Yes, we are not seeking any additional hours over what we have been previously using for the previous 10 years of the agreement.",66,,
353,0.97,2750.314,2754.284,Thanks.,67,,
354,0.97,2754.284,2760.624,I just wanted to confirm that and put a finer point on it.,67,,
355,0.97,2760.624,2779.109,"Otherwise, I don't think I have any other clarifying questions I want to raise at this time, unless another comment from a colleague is requested.",67,,
356,0.97,2779.109,2781.345,I don't see anyone else looking to jump in.,67,,
357,0.97,2781.345,2798.896,"With that, given the presentation and the question and answer period with the panel, I would be inclined to vote on this today . I am going to move the bill to put it in front of us.",67,,
358,0.97,2798.896,2800.197,I move Council built.,67,,
359,0.97,2800.197,2800.831,Is there a second?,67,,
360,0.97,2800.831,2801.665,Second.,68,,
361,0.97,2801.665,2808.071,Moved and Seconded.,69,,
362,0.97,2808.071,2809.64,The bill is in front of the committee.,69,,
363,0.97,2809.64,2815.078,Any comments on the legislation before the committee?,69,,
364,0.97,2815.078,2816.113,I am seeing none.,69,,
365,0.97,2816.113,2820.818,"Mr. clerk, please call the roll are recommending the passage to full council.",69,,
366,0.97,2820.818,2824.755,[roll call],70,,
367,0.97,2824.755,2847.377,& GT; three in favor with one abstention.,71,,
368,0.97,2847.377,2851.882,"Thank you, Mr. clerk.",72,,
369,0.97,2851.882,2853.417,Legislation passes.,72,,
370,0.97,2853.417,2859.79,We will go forward to full Council for consideration.,72,,
371,0.97,2859.79,2868.599,"Thank you very much, panel.",72,,
372,0.97,2868.599,2872.202,We will be in touch as this continues to work its way through the legislative Department.,72,,
373,0.97,2872.202,2874.338,Thank you so much for making yourselves available today.,72,,
374,0.97,2874.338,2875.305,"Superintendent Williams, don't go anywhere.",72,,
375,0.97,2875.305,2882.079,"We're moving on to agenda item three, another parks panel.",72,,
376,0.97,2882.079,2884.414,"Mr. clerk, please read agenda item 3 into the record.",72,,
377,0.97,2884.414,2885.282,[ordinance read],72,,
378,0.97,2885.282,2917.347,"As we are now getting started in earnest, this will be the year where the Council, in our capacity as the board of the metropolitan park district, will consider an additional cycle of investments with the metropolitan park district.",73,,
379,0.97,2917.347,2941.538,"We are now, as I mentioned in my initial report, convened as the public assets and homelessness Committee, but in that capacity, we will be having some brief things about some components of the metropolitan park district investments as relates to Seattle parks and recreation, which is under the Purview of this Committee.",73,,
380,0.97,2941.538,2966.53,"For one of the first things we will be looking at, as we are early in the process still, is the cycle one accomplishments from the Seattle metropolitan park district, which is a property tax levy supported park district supplementary to the general fund that the Seattle parks and recreation received.",73,,
381,0.97,2966.53,2982.446,"We are really looking forward to diving into the slide deck here, and this presentation from Department officials, as an early part of the process to dive into the potential of the metropolitan park district and what we might want to do and a second cycle.",73,,
382,0.97,2982.446,2995.192,"With that context, I will head over to our panel, which again, we are joined by interim superintendent Christopher Williams, and I believe Michele Finnegan.",73,,
383,0.97,2995.192,3002.666,"Superintendent, I will head over to you to introduce the rest of your panel, and start the presentation.",73,,
384,0.97,3002.666,3003.567,Okay.,74,,
385,0.97,3003.567,3010.04,"Thank you, Councilmember . We appreciate the opportunity to be here.",74,,
386,0.97,3010.04,3020.15,It is myself and the extremely capable Michele Finnegan who will walk through this today.,74,,
387,0.97,3020.15,3021.385,She will help field questions here.,74,,
388,0.97,3021.385,3023.019,I might take the lead on the presentation.,74,,
389,0.97,3023.019,3027.324,A lot of this information isn't going to be new to most of you.,74,,
390,0.97,3027.324,3047.544,"You have seen, heard some of this during presentation when you have your park district governing body on, this is a report on the cycle one report.",74,,
391,0.97,3047.544,3057.521,"When we say cycle one, that refers to the end of the six year cycle.",74,,
392,0.97,3057.521,3068.198,"We cover an annual report, Midcycle, and in cycle report.",74,,
393,0.97,3068.198,3079.042,"What we hope to capture here and highlight for you are accomplishments, lessons learned, things--we thought that would work out, but it didn't work out so well.",74,,
394,0.97,3079.042,3087.017,So we want to provide that transparency in this presentation.,74,,
395,0.97,3087.017,3088.285,"We are in a unique, reflective moment.",74,,
396,0.97,3088.285,3125.722,"Normally, when we would be doing a Midcycle report, you would already be convening to adopt the next cycle, but because we have these pauses due to the pandemic, there is this unique reflective moment before you take up the actual second cycle park district work to be reflective on what we have learned . We went through a period of strategic planning.",74,,
397,0.97,3125.722,3131.828,We recently worked with the board of park and recreation commissioners to conclude roughly 2 to 3 months worth of work to make a set of recommendations to the Department.,74,,
398,0.97,3131.828,3158.321,"We submitted those recommendations to the Mayor, and that to here pause really allowed us to complete the in cycle report and to better inform some of the recommendations that have gone into the park district work . We just want to highlight here that this is a unique moment in time.",74,,
399,0.97,3158.321,3181.044,"Today, we will provide a brief overview and context of the cycle . lessons learned, of course . So there were a couple of choices at the beginning.",74,,
400,0.97,3181.044,3192.923,"Were we going to do a levy, or were we going to do a park district?",74,,
401,0.97,3192.923,3198.995,"Historically, the parks Department has done levies where we go to the voters every 6 to 8 years and asked for funding for new shiny things.",74,,
402,0.97,3198.995,3208.004,What is different about the park district ballot measure is that it was designed to supplement the basic operating efficiency of the Department.,74,,
403,0.97,3208.004,3230.293,"It was designed to extend the life of our assets, to meet public expectations for the amount of available hours in our community centers and park maintenance, and it was also designed to insulate the organization from the ebb and flow of the general fund.",74,,
404,0.97,3230.293,3243.506,"One of our goals is to bolster partnerships, and to leverage these dollars while saving taxpayer money.",74,,
405,0.97,3243.506,3259.356,"Ultimately, the committee, when they were looking at the idea of a park district versus a levy, they ultimately decided and a park district for lots of reasons.",74,,
406,0.97,3259.356,3263.627,This was supported by the Mayor and the Council.,74,,
407,0.97,3263.627,3269.165,There were a lot of concerns raised by a park district model.,74,,
408,0.97,3269.165,3272.836,Some people viewed it as writing a blank check.,74,,
409,0.97,3272.836,3278.675,"Therefore, we established an Interlocal agreement with several key provisions.",74,,
410,0.97,3278.675,3315.011,"Those provisions include the provision that the city council would serve as the governing body for the park district, that we would engage in a Six- year planning cycle to be consistent with the state growth management act for comprehensive planning, that we would establish a community advisory board, and we recently Consolidated that into the port of park and recreation commissioners, and that we would establish a general fund commitment floor to the Department.",74,,
411,0.97,3315.011,3330.393,"Basically, what the community was saying is, if we support this, we don't want the city to shrink from its general fund obligation to support the park Department.",74,,
412,0.97,3330.393,3332.329,That is where the general fund commitment came in.,74,,
413,0.97,3332.329,3343.406,"Them once again, it required some regular accountability reporting with an annual report, a Midcycle report, and end cycle report.",74,,
414,0.97,3343.406,3350.914,"Basically, what we want to highlight here is that, for the first six years, more than $250 million was invested across the system.",74,,
415,0.97,3350.914,3358.088,The plan adopted assumed 60% of this would be capital investments.,74,,
416,0.97,3358.088,3365.228,There were some funding changes over the cycle.,74,,
417,0.97,3385.382,3385.648,Before,74,,
418,0.97,3385.648,3391.454,In this slide this is the pool renovation.,75,,
419,0.97,3391.454,3394.257,The idea is pool renovations are really expensive to do.,75,,
420,0.97,3394.257,3400.764,"Maybe without the park district, who knows when we would have gotten to the project of this magnitude.",75,,
421,0.97,3400.764,3413.409,"At the time we adopted the park district proposal or rather plan, a Snapshot of our deferred Capitol maintenance was more than $275 million annually.",75,,
422,0.97,3413.409,3421.785,"So no question that number has grown, but the park district has provided us the capacity to do big projects like this.",75,,
423,0.97,3421.785,3431.561,We made a commitment to do 120 major maintenance projects.,75,,
424,0.97,3431.561,3432.595,We actually completed 123.,75,,
425,0.97,3432.595,3445.208,We identified six community centers that needed structural upgrades just to make them durable into the future.,75,,
426,0.97,3445.208,3452.682,"These weren't major renovations, more or less Sustainability projects to keep the doors open.",75,,
427,0.97,3452.682,3464.327,"We also continued to invest in the zoo and the Aquarium even though these were operated by Non-Profits, they are still park owned facilities.",75,,
428,0.97,3464.327,3468.932,We approved 21 key patches and eight Offleaf dog areas.,75,,
429,0.97,3468.932,3472.969,"Can we actually pause for a moment on this slide, please.",76,,
430,0.97,3472.969,3477.607,I have a couple of clarifying questions.,76,,
431,0.97,3477.607,3481.644,"And if colleagues do, I'm happy to maybe open it up here as well.",76,,
432,0.97,3481.644,3490.82,Do you know off the top of your head the six community centers that received structural and system upgrades?,76,,
433,0.97,3490.82,3502.765,"Yes, so those were Lake City, green Lake, South Park, Jefferson, Queen Anne, and Hiawatha.",77,,
434,0.97,3502.765,3511.641,These were basically stabilization projects that added more useful life to the building.,77,,
435,0.97,3511.641,3513.51,Did some major repairs.,77,,
436,0.97,3513.51,3513.776,Great.,78,,
437,0.97,3513.776,3532.462,"And on the Offleash areas, this is something I certainly hear a lot in my district about Offleash areas and the popularity of the parks Offleash areas.",78,,
438,0.97,3532.462,3534.497,Were any new Offleash areas funded?,78,,
439,0.97,3534.497,3537.634,It says here that eight were improved.,78,,
440,0.97,3537.634,3544.941,But did we get any expansion of Offleash areas in the cycle one in the park district?,78,,
441,0.97,3544.941,3547.41,I believe we did.,79,,
442,0.97,3547.41,3549.679,Unfortunately I can't recall them off the top.,79,,
443,0.97,3549.679,3561.057,So this was not only eight Offleash area improvements and some mix of new Offleash areas.,79,,
444,0.97,3561.057,3567.163,I know we have one in Georgetown that we're still working on.,79,,
445,0.97,3567.163,3571.434,That one comes to mind.,79,,
446,0.97,3571.434,3578.908,We also developed an Offleash comprehensive plan or strategic plan with the citizens for Offleash areas.,79,,
447,0.97,3578.908,3586.983,So a lot of work has gone into this with the local stewardship group that stewards are sharing with parks.,79,,
448,0.97,3587.116,3590.62,"Great, thank you.",80,,
449,0.97,3590.62,3596.626,Do Council colleagues have any questions on this slide before we continue?,80,,
450,0.97,3596.626,3603.7,"Okay, I don't see any additional ones.",80,,
451,0.97,3603.7,3604.233,Go ahead superintendent.,80,,
452,0.97,3604.233,3607.904,Thank you for Pausing there.,80,,
453,0.97,3607.904,3608.471,Sure.,81,,
454,0.97,3608.471,3614.177,"Okay, so additional first cycle accomplishments.",81,,
455,0.97,3614.177,3619.215,Our community centers are open and available to the public during the day.,81,,
456,0.97,3619.215,3637.467,"It is really difficult to do things like finished Gymnasium floors with fumes and paint Thinners, that sort of thing, so we created a third shift overnight crew to do a lot of the work that is just not appropriate to do while the public is in the building.",81,,
457,0.97,3637.467,3645.174,We also funded more support with our partners and animal control.,81,,
458,0.97,3645.174,3661.024,"And while there is a lot of support for Offleash areas, you know, one of our number one complaints believe it or not are Offleash area dogs in our parks.",81,,
459,0.97,3661.024,3680.443,"So we partnered with animal control to develop a program to enhance enforcement in our public parks to ensure they're Leashing their dogs, obeying scoop laws.",81,,
460,0.97,3680.443,3682.311,We issued 300 verbal warnings.,81,,
461,0.97,3682.311,3691.054,"And just to clarify you just said complaints about Offleash areas, did you mean about dogs being Offleash?",82,,
462,0.97,3691.054,3692.355,I just want to clarify.,82,,
463,0.97,3692.355,3693.756,I'm sorry.,83,,
464,0.97,3693.756,3696.259,Thank you for that clarification.,83,,
465,0.97,3696.259,3704.6,"But no, I was saying Ironically, we just talked about Offleash areas.",83,,
466,0.97,3704.6,3712.141,"And those are great, however, one of the complaints we get are dogs off leash in developed parks.",83,,
467,0.97,3712.141,3721.451,Because of that we developed a program working with animal control to make sure we have enhanced enforcement.,83,,
468,0.97,3721.451,3728.825,We want to encourage people to follow the dog leash rules or to use the dog Offleash parks.,83,,
469,0.97,3728.825,3747.043,"I went on to say that we issued 1,650 citations and 300 verbal warnings were issued during this period of time.",83,,
470,0.97,3747.043,3759.755,Other accomplishments here is we also developed a program to enhance Restroom cleaning across the system.,83,,
471,0.97,3759.755,3767.53,We expanded the cleaning at 41 comfort stations is what we referred to them in our public parks.,83,,
472,0.97,3767.53,3772.768,We're supporting the Reforce station and maintenance of our green belt and natural areas.,83,,
473,0.97,3772.768,3789.051,"We're doing a lot of work with the office of Sustainability on trees, and I think what you're going to see when the park district proposal comes to you as an investment in more trees in our urban areas.",83,,
474,0.97,3789.051,3794.49,And just to pause a little bit on this slide too.,84,,
475,0.97,3794.49,3802.565,Do we know how many--I mean I've seen the volunteer hours for the forest restoration and maintenance.,84,,
476,0.97,3802.565,3809.472,Do we know how many trees were planted as part of these efforts?,84,,
477,0.97,3809.472,3813.309,That would be a good statistic I think to share with folks.,84,,
478,0.97,3813.309,3818.748,"You know, we could certainly go back and get that metric.",85,,
479,0.97,3818.748,3823.953,I bet Michelle could pull it out as we go through this presentation.,85,,
480,0.97,3823.953,3825.788,"Not specifically trees, but native plants.",86,,
481,0.97,3825.788,3835.097,"And we planted over 600,000 native plants in our Forested areas.",86,,
482,0.97,3835.231,3836.766,And that's great.,87,,
483,0.97,3836.899,3837.466,Thank you for sharing that.,88,,
484,0.97,3837.6,3841.671,Absolutely.,89,,
485,0.97,3841.671,3846.142,"All right, why don't we get to the next slide.",89,,
486,0.97,3846.142,3857.32,Another emphasis for park district resource was on improving access to recreational services and our attempt to reach people in communities that have been historically Underserved.,90,,
487,0.97,3857.32,3865.661,"So we have a big focus in this organization on racial social justice, equity, and access.",90,,
488,0.97,3865.661,3877.006,We made investments and new public open space across the system.,90,,
489,0.97,3877.006,3878.741,Are you on slide number nine?,90,,
490,0.97,3878.741,3883.913,"Yep, you're on slide number nine, okay.",90,,
491,0.97,3883.913,3887.65,We awarded more than $7 million in grants.,90,,
492,0.97,3887.65,3888.451,We made improvements --,90,,
493,0.97,3888.451,3890.786,"& GT; all right Christopher, I must be on a different slide than you.",91,,
494,0.97,3890.92,3895.224,You're a different slide than me.,92,,
495,0.97,3895.224,3909.572,So I think this one was I think you started the increased access for recreational programming including we added a new recreational scholarship fund.,93,,
496,0.97,3909.572,3909.939,"Okay, right.",94,,
497,0.97,3910.072,3952.014,"And we have three new grant programs that support community bringing art into our parks and doing programming that Furthers to get people moving in a healthy way especially those that are most at risk of health related disparity and then a recreation for all programs that brings community organizations into our facilities to bring more diverse programming, so we have served over, sorry, 50,000 participants in that endeavor of this cycle.",95,,
498,0.97,3952.014,3954.684,And I think you're on this one.,95,,
499,0.97,3954.684,3955.551,"Thank you, Michelle.",96,,
500,0.97,3955.551,3956.986,Good save and good catch.,96,,
501,0.97,3956.986,3959.588,I jumped ahead of myself here.,96,,
502,0.97,3959.588,3963.926,Again we made investments and in New public open space.,96,,
503,0.97,3963.926,3967.263,We purchased 18 properties totaling more than nine acres.,96,,
504,0.97,3967.263,3973.869,We have awarded more than $7 million in grants for community based projects through the major project challenge Fund.,96,,
505,0.97,3973.869,3981.444,Five of the 14 landing sites were developed.,96,,
506,0.97,3981.444,3991.787,And you know a lot of this work is the kind of work that has a lot of community engagement as a component to it.,96,,
507,0.97,3991.787,4005.101,We just talked to a lot of the community when they came to us with grant proposals and the park board was heavily engaged in that work as was the park district oversight committee.,96,,
508,0.97,4005.101,4013.809,And then certainly the park development projects had huge community engagement proponents to them.,96,,
509,0.97,4013.809,4014.11,Next slide.,96,,
510,0.97,4014.11,4028.991,"Okay, so on this slide continuing with accomplishments, the first five cycle went more or less as planned.",96,,
511,0.97,4028.991,4038.267,In 2020 as you know the world changed and we were revealing the Covid pandemic due to Covid.,96,,
512,0.97,4038.267,4043.706,Allowing us the flexibility to respond to this major unprecedented emergency.,96,,
513,0.97,4043.706,4059.088,We've Pivoted our mission to E Sen is issue functions and staff became essential workers with more than 250 people were provided shelter in three community centers across the system.,96,,
514,0.97,4059.088,4064.527,Almost a thousand youth were served in the all-day Covid Compliant chair programs.,96,,
515,0.97,4064.527,4078.14,"Our staff acted as social distancing ambassadors, busy parks across the system and others about that, the social distance program was piloted right here in the Seattle park and recreational Department.",96,,
516,0.97,4078.14,4090.286,But that model would become a national model across the United States for helping the public enjoy the public parks in a safe way during the pandemic.,96,,
517,0.97,4090.286,4101.13,We work hard to keep our Elders and people with disabilities engaged in our programs through the offering of virtual programs across the system.,96,,
518,0.97,4101.13,4101.464,Next slide.,96,,
519,0.97,4101.597,4109.538,More lessons learned here.,97,,
520,0.97,4109.538,4117.446,You know we've been engaged in a process of continuous performance and improvement with regards to the park district.,97,,
521,0.97,4117.446,4130.292,And some of the observations or lessons learned we had is that the decision to create that district has proven to be the right decision from our perspective.,97,,
522,0.97,4130.292,4142.705,It has helped build critical resiliency in the Department and it has helped insulate the Department operations from Inanticipated swings of the general fund budget.,97,,
523,0.97,4142.705,4165.394,The flexibility of the park district resources have allowed us to creatively Reprogram resources to mitigate general Fund and park fund shortfalls through multiple budget cycles and mostly and most recently during the period of unprecedented uncertainty due to Covid-19.,97,,
524,0.97,4165.394,4185.214,"Our 2020 pivot pandemic response is perhaps the best example of the role these resources played, you know, because the park district resources are Fungible meaning we don't make a distinction between capital funding and operations.",97,,
525,0.97,4185.214,4192.988,It's worth noting the park district was able to step in to help relieve some pressure on the general fund.,97,,
526,0.97,4192.988,4196.158,"Next slide, please.",97,,
527,0.97,4196.158,4211.874,"So what this slide is attempting to convey is that on the operating side, let's take that time line, activation, get moving, recreation for all arts and parks.",97,,
528,0.97,4211.874,4222.351,Those are various grants and the park district funds about 30% of that overall effort.,97,,
529,0.97,4222.351,4228.557,"And let's use golf, for example.",97,,
530,0.97,4228.557,4232.795,There are no park district dollars that goes into the golf program.,97,,
531,0.97,4232.795,4240.869,It operates on the Self-Recovery model.,97,,
532,0.97,4240.869,4254.383,Under recreational facility about 18% of the park district revenues are supporting our community center hours and community access.,97,,
533,0.97,4254.383,4280.876,"Under capital acquisition, park district revenues were providing 50% of our acquisition dollars and we were actually going to zero that out in this next cycle because King County just adopted a measure where they will provide 100% of the funding for properties and in low income areas.",97,,
534,0.97,4280.876,4285.447,And so that was good news here recently.,97,,
535,0.97,4285.447,4295.557,And also we don't have any current debt service although we anticipate there will be some debt service in this next cycle of funding.,97,,
536,0.97,4295.557,4301.263,"Of course, our urban forestry program, the park district is providing 42% of the funding.",97,,
537,0.97,4301.263,4314.209,So this will get into kind of an interesting conversation because as we're talking about the park district you see that 19% there at the bottom.,97,,
538,0.97,4314.209,4326.989,One would believe they were responsible for greater overall percentage of our $288 million budget when in fact the park district will make up about 19%.,97,,
539,0.97,4326.989,4329.692,A significant 19% of our budget.,97,,
540,0.97,4329.692,4329.925,Next slide.,97,,
541,0.97,4330.259,4353.282,"Okay, so some of the lessons learned is that we thought we should maybe redo or reestablish the board of commissioners to advise on the park district.",97,,
542,0.97,4353.282,4371.367,We made that change this year and what drove us to make that change is we have people who served on the park board and they have a scope of decision making that didn't include the park district because there was a separate citizen oversight committee.,97,,
543,0.97,4371.367,4379.074,It seemed kind of silly to have the two advisory groups not be able to talk to each other about some fairly important issues concerning the departments.,97,,
544,0.97,4379.074,4393.956,So we brought to you some legislation that changed how the park board is organized.,97,,
545,0.97,4393.956,4405.968,We've really needed to focus on centering and amending the inner local agreement to reference the community response fund verses the major project challenge Fund.,97,,
546,0.97,4405.968,4419.047,And this was a big capital project challenge fund where you could receive up to $1.8 million in funding match when most communities probably can't raise that level of funding.,97,,
547,0.97,4419.047,4432.094,"So we wanted to do something that could make a change and recognize, you know, a Moric Tackable access to grants in the system.",97,,
548,0.97,4432.094,4438.167,Also we amended the reporting Timelines to better reflect the planning.,97,,
549,0.97,4438.167,4465.327,So there were examples of the local agreement where we needed to be delivering recommendations to you before we actually presented the in cycle report or presented an annual report and we wanted to sort of true up those expectations.,97,,
550,0.97,4465.327,4465.627,Next slide.,97,,
551,0.97,4465.627,4467.396,"Superintendent, council member Herbold has a question.",98,,
552,0.97,4467.396,4467.763,"Okay, great.",99,,
553,0.97,4467.763,4472.401,Thank you so much.,100,,
554,0.97,4472.401,4483.445,"On the lessons learned, the narrative says you renamed the major project challenge fund to a community response Fund, but I'm sure it's more than just a name change.",100,,
555,0.97,4483.445,4492.387,Was wondering if you could actually explain what the difference is?,100,,
556,0.97,4492.387,4492.621,Sure.,101,,
557,0.97,4492.621,4511.907,"So the major project fund was basically designed to recognize that we had some really big facilities like the green Lake center project, you know, as several million dollar project that the advisory Council had been working on for years.",101,,
558,0.97,4511.907,4517.346,Not everybody across Seattle has a neighborhood project that big and that size.,101,,
559,0.97,4517.346,4526.054,They had some pretty clear parameters on your access to be able to apply for a grant for that funding.,101,,
560,0.97,4526.054,4535.631,I think the minimum threshold was a $1.2 million level of application fee just to apply for it all the way up to $1.8 million.,101,,
561,0.97,4535.631,4548.11,That left out a lot of community initiatives and a lot of neighborhoods and communities that might have just wanted to do a play area project.,101,,
562,0.97,4548.11,4562.724,We've taken that funding and created this sort of equity center community grant opportunity that will give communities all over the city an opportunity to apply for grant.,101,,
563,0.97,4562.724,4564.993,"The other good news, this will not require a match.",101,,
564,0.97,4565.127,4579.708,And so no match is required and you lower the minimum threshold from $1.2 to just no minimum threshold?,102,,
565,0.97,4579.708,4580.409,"Up to $750,000.",103,,
566,0.97,4580.409,4581.51,"Okay, thank you very much.",104,,
567,0.97,4581.51,4581.843,Appreciate it.,104,,
568,0.97,4581.977,4587.95,"Michelle, were you trying to get in there?",105,,
569,0.97,4587.95,4588.216,"Oh, okay.",105,,
570,0.97,4588.216,4588.417,Okay.,105,,
571,0.97,4588.417,4588.817,Next slide.,105,,
572,0.97,4588.817,4606.735,"Okay, another aspect of the park district being so integral to our programs and services is talking only about one Fund.",105,,
573,0.97,4606.735,4618.313,One of the things that's hard for us is just by way of example we were on the phone here a few days ago with the school district.,105,,
574,0.97,4618.313,4625.087,"You know there was discussion about coming down to the school district or rather coming down to the park district building, right?",105,,
575,0.97,4625.087,4634.096,The reality is we want to be able to talk about the park district and the context of the overall mission for the Department.,105,,
576,0.97,4634.096,4637.132,The overall services that we provide.,105,,
577,0.97,4637.132,4640.369,The overall work that we do with the community.,105,,
578,0.97,4640.369,4664.76,"We recognize that it is important to be accountable for the park district dollars, but we would like to I think change our narrative in how we have the discussions with the community since 20% of the Department's budget is made up of park district resources.",105,,
579,0.97,4664.76,4684.913,"So we're not stepping away from the overall accountability, but we would like to step in to a more comprehensive discussion about the goals, the mission, the planning, and the resources for the organization in a more comprehensive way.",105,,
580,0.97,4684.913,4693.522,And that is one of the big lessons learned in one of the Takeaways that we have in our discussion about the park district.,105,,
581,0.97,4693.522,4693.822,Next slide.,105,,
582,0.97,4693.955,4699.027,"And so can we go back to slide 15 for just a moment, please?",106,,
583,0.97,4699.027,4699.327,You bet.,107,,
584,0.97,4699.461,4701.63,Thank you.,108,,
585,0.97,4701.763,4721.149,I have a strong preference for continuing at a level to track at the initiative level the metropolitan park district items.,109,,
586,0.97,4721.149,4733.495,I don't have an issue with that data also being or that information being accessible or visible in an operating lines of business format.,109,,
587,0.97,4733.495,4744.873,I would have a hard time Transitioning completely from a park district initiative to operating lines of business.,109,,
588,0.97,4744.873,4756.418,I'm happy to talk about it I just find it easier to track and do the work of the park district initiative items as just a personal preference.,109,,
589,0.97,4756.418,4766.294,I don't know if Council colleagues want to weigh in on this chart as well or if central staff also has clarifying questions at this time.,109,,
590,0.97,4766.294,4792.287,"But this is one that I wanted to flag on the side deck for some future discussion about how we can accommodate some of the interest that parks is flagging, but also not lose track of--the detail of having park district initiative level line items.",109,,
591,0.97,4792.287,4797.559,I don't see anyone else who wanted to comment on this slide.,109,,
592,0.97,4797.559,4798.693,Oh Council member Herbold.,109,,
593,0.97,4798.693,4798.927,Sure.,110,,
594,0.97,4798.927,4820.315,"I would probably need to spend a little bit more time with this slide, but I agree with you, chair Lewis, the objective should be to communicate with the public what their park district dollars are buying and make the accountability transparency easier.",110,,
595,0.97,4820.315,4838.9,"It seems to me being more specific on the lines of business for the park district initiative that that actually enhances communication, accountability, and transparency.",110,,
596,0.97,4838.9,4840.769,I'm not opposed to a shift to a different approach.,110,,
597,0.97,4840.769,4849.811,I don't want to lose sight of what sort of the overall policy goals are for the use of the lines of business.,110,,
598,0.97,4849.945,4861.723,We hear you on maintaining the transparency and--I think reporting and visibility of the initiatives in the budget.,111,,
599,0.97,4861.856,4865.66,"Okay, all right.",112,,
600,0.97,4865.66,4867.996,I think we can go to the next slide.,112,,
601,0.97,4867.996,4868.763,"Thank you, thank you.",113,,
602,0.97,4868.763,4869.698,You bet.,114,,
603,0.97,4869.698,4877.172,So this slide is attempting to--so I'll tell a story here.,114,,
604,0.97,4877.172,4886.948,"There was once upon a time if you were to ask Seattle parks and recreation for any performance management data, you know, you would have gotten goose egg, right?",114,,
605,0.97,4886.948,4897.459,Or it would have been really difficult for us to provide you that information because we didn't have the system set up.,114,,
606,0.97,4897.459,4904.899,We didn't have the technical tools readily available to us.,114,,
607,0.97,4904.899,4909.804,We didn't have a data informed decision making process in the Department.,114,,
608,0.97,4909.804,4917.846,"And what this dash board really shows is that we count everything, right?",114,,
609,0.97,4917.846,4920.181,There were some questions today about Metrics.,114,,
610,0.97,4920.181,4925.553,"Well, I don't have those on the top of my head.",114,,
611,0.97,4925.553,4929.758,We have this Website available on our Website.,114,,
612,0.97,4929.758,4941.97,And we have lots of operating budget data related to the park district on our data dash board.,114,,
613,0.97,4941.97,4946.241,That's available to anyone who could go on and look at that.,114,,
614,0.97,4946.241,4948.843,It is up to date.,114,,
615,0.97,4948.843,4955.183,We talk about dash board reporting and data management.,114,,
616,0.97,4955.183,4960.388,Almost religiously in this organization.,114,,
617,0.97,4960.388,4981.676,"So I think one of the big learning in growth opportunities for the Department related to the park district has been this Immersive, I think commitment to data gathering collection, cure rating data, and reporting it out.",114,,
618,0.97,4981.676,4981.976,Next slide.,114,,
619,0.97,4981.976,4985.747,So more on the continuous learning.,114,,
620,0.97,4985.747,4989.684,I know Traci will remember this.,114,,
621,0.97,4989.684,4998.993,We were required to look at three lines of business over the course of the six-year cycle.,114,,
622,0.97,4998.993,5002.33,There was a park maintenance report.,114,,
623,0.97,5002.33,5009.504,"There was a recreation division report, and there was a planning and development division report.",114,,
624,0.97,5009.504,5017.512,And we looked at how to improve the operations and these three specific areas.,114,,
625,0.97,5017.512,5026.554,Under our park maintenance program we established a comprehensive asset management program.,114,,
626,0.97,5026.554,5033.628,We even have piloted a stage Gating program conducted routine condition assessments across the system.,114,,
627,0.97,5033.628,5049.744,"Under our community centers, our recreation division program, we have done a lot of work to ensure the Seattle park and recreation Council relationship is functioning as intended.",114,,
628,0.97,5049.744,5062.056,We want to--we've worked hard to increase data collection and strengthen performance measures and the operations of our community centers.,114,,
629,0.97,5062.056,5074.936,We use public dollars and low income neighborhoods where we expect more revenue from higher income neighborhoods.,114,,
630,0.97,5074.936,5077.605,So continuing to double down on that.,114,,
631,0.97,5077.605,5089.517,"And then in our planning development division we had a significant level of Underspend in that division, Underspend in capital.",114,,
632,0.97,5089.517,5094.789,We made some significant changes structurally and organizationally.,114,,
633,0.97,5094.789,5098.693,Some of it was staffing and staffing capacity changes.,114,,
634,0.97,5098.693,5103.932,Some of it was integrating a stage gate process for capital projects.,114,,
635,0.97,5103.932,5110.872,And then really upgrading our technology and work system was a part of that work.,114,,
636,0.97,5110.872,5111.172,Next slide.,114,,
637,0.97,5111.172,5129.357,"So if you're interested in cycle report update, you can see those various colored dots represent projects across the system.",114,,
638,0.97,5129.357,5141.369,We were able to leverage 25 partnerships in Underserved communities.,114,,
639,0.97,5141.369,5151.513,In the mid cycle progress we treated 2015 like a ramp up year.,114,,
640,0.97,5151.513,5154.749,Implemented programs in 2016 and '17.,114,,
641,0.97,5154.749,5157.352,We provided 62 grants to community groups.,114,,
642,0.97,5157.352,5169.097,And Christopher that's just an example of the level of detail if you get into those reports you'll find that for each of the cycle one initiatives.,115,,
643,0.97,5169.097,5169.564,Just an example there.,115,,
644,0.97,5169.564,5172.233,Enticing people to dive in deeper.,115,,
645,0.97,5172.233,5173.535,I didn't enter the data.,116,,
646,0.97,5173.535,5173.735,Okay.,116,,
647,0.97,5173.735,5185.747,And then the next slide is just a Q & amp; a slide if you have questions for Michelle or myself.,116,,
648,0.97,5185.88,5202.163,Thank you so much for sharing the resources and the dash board and everything else that I have unveiled myself of and Council colleagues have as well.,117,,
649,0.97,5202.163,5205.7,Are there any questions now that we're through?,117,,
650,0.97,5205.7,5206.201,Council member Herbold?,117,,
651,0.97,5206.334,5208.303,Thank you.,118,,
652,0.97,5208.303,5217.612,I'm just reviewing the central staff memo dated June 10.,118,,
653,0.97,5217.612,5229.557,I'm trying to Orient myself on sort of where we are in the planning process and pending recommendations.,118,,
654,0.97,5229.557,5241.869,"There are a couple of attachments at the end, and I see attachment one, of course, cycle one initiatives funded in the adopted budget.",118,,
655,0.97,5241.869,5251.746,But attachment two is proposed Precommitment projects.,118,,
656,0.97,5251.746,5264.092,I'm assuming these are proposed by parks and recreation to the board.,118,,
657,0.97,5264.092,5270.265,And then attachment three is park cycle initiative one and cycle two plan in 2023 from posed budget.,118,,
658,0.97,5270.265,5280.274,Can you just give me a little bit more of an understanding of where we are in the process?,118,,
659,0.97,5280.274,5285.246,These are proposals that parks have made to the board and the board has or hasn't taken action yet?,118,,
660,0.97,5285.246,5305.867,The board of parks and recreation Commission did take action on those recommendations both on--primarily on--and you'll hear about this all next Friday on a new set of investment opportunities about $30 million of new investment opportunities.,119,,
661,0.97,5305.867,5313.007,An affirmation of those Pre-Equipment projects and they'll go into further conversation about that next week as well.,119,,
662,0.97,5313.007,5326.754,"And then I also think they gave a nod to or affirmed that what Fpr was recommending is recommending, which is all of the initiatives that were funded in cycle one would, in fact, be carried forward into cycle two.",119,,
663,0.97,5326.754,5334.228,"So that list that we just saw on one of the slides back here, look at all those initiatives.",119,,
664,0.97,5334.228,5348.476,They would be recommending those initiatives all be carried forward I think except for two of them that actually in the end get picked up as new proposals in the cycle two recommendations from the board of parks and Rec.,119,,
665,0.97,5348.476,5368.496,"So we will be having further conversation about all of this including in particular the part that you have not yet seen, though I have several Followup E-Mails to give you more details on these 38 new investment opportunities that parks and Rec Commission adopted at their May 19 meeting.",119,,
666,0.97,5368.496,5369.864,And so what's happening next Friday?,120,,
667,0.97,5369.864,5373.534,Are they presenting their recommendations?,120,,
668,0.97,5373.534,5378.239,They will be--I think the Co-Chairs will be there to give some opening remarks.,121,,
669,0.97,5378.239,5385.78,They are not going to go through every one of their recommendations.,121,,
670,0.97,5385.78,5388.116,Eric Mcconohe and I will walk those on the 24th.,121,,
671,0.97,5388.116,5388.983,Got it.,122,,
672,0.97,5388.983,5390.985,"All right, thank you so much.",122,,
673,0.97,5390.985,5391.319,Appreciate it.,122,,
674,0.97,5391.319,5393.121,"Yeah, you bet.",123,,
675,0.97,5393.254,5395.59,Thank you for those questions.,124,,
676,0.97,5395.59,5405.066,And for those viewing at home that was an exchange about the early part of our process on recommendations for cycle two.,124,,
677,0.97,5405.066,5413.174,"Just to foreshadow a little bit, which is great.",124,,
678,0.97,5413.174,5440.034,"Actually related to that superintendent Williams, I don't know if this question is too premature, but does the Department at this time anticipate carrying over all of those line items from the previous cycle or places where the Department anticipates consolidations and Reapportionments in some of the initial recommendations that you guys will send down?",124,,
679,0.97,5440.034,5448.309,And now feel free to tell me we'll be talking about this a lot over the summer.,124,,
680,0.97,5448.309,5448.543,Yeah.,125,,
681,0.97,5448.543,5477.205,"I mean I could say high level, you know, I think the way we talk about what we consider Precommitments internally is that funding at least to us recognizes that for the first ten years between, you know, the year 2000 and well I guess 14 years, in 2014 that we had taken significant levels of budget cuts and reductions.",125,,
682,0.97,5477.205,5488.349,"To the Department and our ability to operate staff community centers, maintain our parks, do our facility maintenance.",125,,
683,0.97,5488.349,5500.394,And we have thought about that baseline as a way to fact filling sort of ensuring that we continue to back fill those reductions going forward.,125,,
684,0.97,5500.394,5513.14,"And so a lot of the funding on the operating side would mean that for example in community centers, you might reduce hours at community centers, for example, right?",125,,
685,0.97,5513.14,5523.417,Or have some other unintended consequence across the system.,125,,
686,0.97,5523.417,5543.404,That's how we got to kind of a conclusion that we felt like what's included in that description of baseline was really just bolstering the Department's operations from years of prior budget reductions.,125,,
687,0.97,5543.537,5545.539,"Okay, that's good context.",126,,
688,0.97,5545.539,5549.31,Are there any other Council questions?,126,,
689,0.97,5549.31,5553.714,"Okay, I don't see any.",126,,
690,0.97,5553.714,5562.723,"Well panel, thank you so much for meeting here to share that cycle one report with the committee.",126,,
691,0.97,5562.723,5583.978,"It's a good way to kind of kick off this work to have a good overview of how the first, you know, six year plus cycle has gone and what some of that work is and how that sets the foundation for moving forward with our work this summer and fall on building a plan for cycle two.",126,,
692,0.97,5583.978,5588.749,And looking forward to a lot more of these discussions as we Cue up that work.,126,,
693,0.97,5588.749,5595.122,"So with that I think we're good on this item of business, which was our last item of business.",126,,
694,0.97,5595.122,5601.529,I do want to do one last shout out while you guys are here.,126,,
695,0.97,5601.529,5613.574,"Superintendent Williams, I appreciate the parks Department sending along to my office, and I discussed this at Council briefing.",126,,
696,0.97,5613.574,5627.088,"The large amount of summer opportunities, and particularly for, you know, life guarding, but also staffing our community centers, staffing Wading pools, recreation Council or opportunities.",126,,
697,0.97,5627.088,5637.932,Great job especially for young people in the city who are looking for an opportunity this summer to make some money and get outside and have a job of a responsibility and good experience.,126,,
698,0.97,5637.932,5649.276,And I am going to be sending out a newsletter to my subscriber list.,126,,
699,0.97,5649.276,5653.481,You know doing an all call for people who sign up for those jobs.,126,,
700,0.97,5653.481,5665.893,I just want to make that plug also in public session for folks who may be listening or invested in our Seattle parks in the metropolitan park district and everything else.,126,,
701,0.97,5665.893,5685.646,"You know that work has been made possible by the folks who do these important jobs in Seattle parks and recreation, and there's a lot of opportunities to join that family and strongly encourage folks to reach out to parks and Rec to apply for those jobs, so we can enjoy those great public assets this summer.",126,,
702,0.97,5685.646,5693.12,With that is there any other business to come before the committee before we adjourn?,126,,
703,0.97,5693.12,5697.525,"No one is looking to keep us here, great.",126,,
704,0.97,5697.525,5702.296,So with that it is 3:38 P.M.,126,,
705,0.97,5702.296,5708.669,And the meeting of the public assets and homelessness Committee is hereby adjourned.,126,,
706,0.97,5708.669,5709.77,Thank you.,127,,
