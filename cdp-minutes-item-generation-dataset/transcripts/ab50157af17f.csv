466,0.97,3368.998,3376.806,Thank you so much for letting me ride along with you on Wednesday morning and for showing me the power of low Acuity first response.,116,,
467,0.97,3376.806,3390.52,The commitment to public service and the compassion in which you owed great a tough job on a daily basis what was inspiring to see.,116,,
468,0.97,3390.52,3395.458,"Just a little bit of background, although I am sure the viewing public is very familiar with Healthone at this point, given our deliberations.",116,,
469,0.97,3395.458,3409.839,"Healthone is an integrated team of Hsd workers and firefighters that respond to low Acuity public health based responses in the field . a lot of the things we have been discussing, replacing sworn armed officers response with.",116,,
470,0.97,3409.839,3423.853,It really put in stark reality for me that we have a model staring us right in the face that is a viable first response alternative to armed police to address these kinds of calls.,116,,
471,0.97,3423.853,3434.164,It is a moral imperative that calls regarding behavioral mental health and substance addiction receive a public health response and Healthone can be that response.,116,,
472,0.97,3434.164,3447.143,"I look forward to pushing in this budget in 2021 with all of my colleagues here, to make that a reality and go forward with expanding the scope and scale of Healthone.",116,,
473,0.97,3447.143,3473.87,"Highly recommended, just as Councilmember Mosqueda said last week, that everyone take advantage of the generosity of Healthone in going to have a ride along with them, just as they did with Councilmember Mosqueda . They also implored me to relay that, that they eagerly would like to give everyone the same ride along opportunity.",116,,
474,0.97,3473.87,3487.417,"I will just say this too, they are, as I am sure Councilmember can attest to, they are an extremely approachable, affable, and experienced team.",116,,
475,0.97,3487.417,3492.121,I can just say how good it is to spend the morning with them.,116,,
476,0.97,3492.121,3508.538,"Also, the optimism in which they think this task, this job and the hope that they instill in you that this could be a new system that brings forward a new reality that moves to a more responsive and equitable method of first response.",116,,
477,0.97,3508.538,3517.514,I really appreciate their service and appreciated that opportunity and we will join Councilmember Mosqueda in similarly encouraging everybody to take advantage of that ride along opportunity.,116,,
478,0.97,3517.514,3525.221,"This Thursday, I will be attending the Puget sound region Council operations Committee, following that, I will be attending a meeting of the Puget sound Council board.",116,,
479,0.97,3525.221,3533.763,I want to prevent pivot now to discuss legislation I will be working with this afternoon.,116,,
480,0.97,3533.763,3550.78,"All of us have seen over the last several months, more than ever, that thousands of our neighbors are living in vehicles and tents without the adequate support and services that all people are entitled to in a city as wealthy as ours.",116,,
481,0.97,3550.78,3560.556,"This requires urgency from city leadership from the Mayor, from the Council, from all of us working together.",116,,
482,0.97,3560.556,3573.67,"In that spirit, I am pleased to announce today the first step in a new collaboration between the Mayor, the Council, and our service provider community.",116,,
483,0.97,3573.67,3598.528,"This afternoon, I'm going to walk on a provisional to amend some legislation from the summer balancing session to free up some resources to allow the executive, in collaboration with the provider community and the Council to stand up the on shelter outreach and response team, which will be the city's central response coordinator team to collaborate with the outreach efforts with our contracted providers.",116,,
484,0.97,3598.528,3612.342,"Contrary to popular belief, and as many of us here well know, the city's outreach efforts have never exclusively in their Purview of the old navigation team.",116,,
485,0.97,3612.342,3623.519,"The dedicated staff of reach, chief Seattle Club, downtown mercy service center, the urban League, the defender Association, and many others have always been the fundamental core of our Community-Based outreach model and they remain that today.",116,,
486,0.97,3623.519,3642.372,"I do want to say, for members of the viewing public concerned about the absence of the navigation team come a robust outreach is continuing . robust outreach has been continuing and it has been from our Community-Based providers that far outnumber the outreach that was done by the navigation team and always has.",116,,
487,0.97,3642.372,3644.24,That work has continued and that work does continue.,116,,
488,0.97,3644.24,3657.453,"In that spirit, this new team with the in Hsd, is focused on building and empowering that tradition of centering outreach and community providers first.",116,,
489,0.97,3657.453,3661.791,"By probing so, this team will not be authorized for infield outreach.",116,,
490,0.97,3661.791,3690.92,"That will be the exclusive Purview of our outreach providers . rather, this thing is an acknowledgment that our provider community are capable and diligent infield outreach partners and that their service can be enhanced by Partnering with the city to bring the resources only the city can get out into the field to assist in their mission.",116,,
491,0.97,3690.92,3693.056,It goes without saying this team will be exclusively civilian.,116,,
492,0.97,3693.056,3696.359,Thus the practice of using armed and unified police of homeless outreach Coronation is resolutely over.,116,,
493,0.97,3696.359,3708.638,This new model will acknowledge that strength of the city can bring as a partner by coordinating in a variety of essential services to support the provider community.,116,,
494,0.97,3708.638,3725.555,"This includes garbage pickup, shark exposure, this includes standing up hygiene abilities and many other services to give a little bit of detail before this shows up this afternoon, I will give you the top line of the bottom line, so to speak.",116,,
495,0.97,3725.555,3734.397,This proviso would incorporate one $.8 million for third-party outreach.,116,,
496,0.97,3734.397,3745.374,This is including a little over $1 million of new outreach funds from Hsd Savings and from Finance administrative services contract savings.,116,,
497,0.97,3745.374,3760.323,"The additional 7 1/2 thousand dollars is money for reach that was already in the budget, but will now be released with more expediency.",116,,
498,0.97,3760.323,3776.172,"In addition to outreach, this money can be invested in behavioral health services, flexible financial assistance, case management and housing navigation.",116,,
499,0.97,3776.172,3781.577,This is per feedback from the provider community on the needs they face in the field and what they would like additional city Cyst assistance to address.,116,,
500,0.97,3781.577,3803.633,"This would also release $245,000 to be spent on Hsd salary on this new team with a cap of eight approved Ftes from the $245,000 . This is only for 2020. this provision will not extend into 2021, unless we decide to do it in our fall budget session.",116,,
501,0.97,3803.633,3811.841,"This bill comes out of weeks on negotiations between Council, Mayor, and service providers.",116,,
502,0.97,3811.841,3819.815,I want to thank Councilmember Morales for being steadfast in helping those negotiations move along.,116,,
503,0.97,3819.815,3830.726,I want to thank deputy Mayor secular for helping could be the table and providing common ground that addresses all of our common interests.,116,,
504,0.97,3830.726,3855.084,"Of course, I want to thank our outreach partners, the defender Association, chief Seattle Club and many others for the work they do every day and also for their contributions to this process that censored their voices and their needs in determining what a new outreach model toward chronic homelessness is going to look like.",116,,
505,0.97,3855.084,3856.319,The navigation team model is gone.,116,,
506,0.97,3856.319,3861.791,We are on the forefront of a new and collaborative model centering outreach and the needs of our neighbors living on shelter.,116,,
507,0.97,3861.791,3870.9,I am available this week to discuss this proposal in more detail with any member of the Council and I note that this measure represents the beginning and not the end of this new approach.,116,,
508,0.97,3870.9,3890.62,"I want to note the productive negotiations are ongoing between the executive and our provider community and more than any law or appropriation, the goodwill, the patience and respect that has defined these discussions will shape the future of our homelessness response.",116,,
509,0.97,3890.62,3893.923,I look forward to discussing this legislation throughout this week and hopefully passing it next Monday.,116,,
510,0.97,3893.923,3905.868,"I am happy to answer what questions I can now and note that the legislation will be on IRC, hopefully to be walked on with the indulgence of the Council this afternoon.",116,,
511,0.97,3905.868,3910.139,Thank you for letting me provide that update.,116,,
512,0.97,3910.139,3912.241,I have no further updates at this time.,116,,
513,0.97,3912.241,3913.843,Take you Councilmember Lewis.,117,,
514,0.97,3913.843,3915.411,Does anybody have any questions?,117,,
515,0.97,3915.411,3919.649,Councilmember Mosqueda.,117,,
516,0.97,3919.649,3925.154,Good morning . Thank you very much Councilman for Lewis for that summary.,118,,
517,0.97,3925.154,3928.624,I look over to reading the proposal in more detail.,118,,
518,0.97,3928.624,3951.18,I appreciate the work as you have tried to make sure that you both identify the funding that the city council had appropriated was or was not being used at this moment and really to clarify both to the public and working partnership with the provider organizations to make sure they have the support that they need.,118,,
519,0.97,3951.18,3960.489,I appreciate you underscoring the role of the police led homelessness response is no longer the process the city will engage in.,118,,
520,0.97,3960.489,3962.958,That is true under the model you are engaged in.,118,,
521,0.97,3962.958,3964.16,I heard you say that clearly.,118,,
522,0.97,3964.16,3994.824,"Just to offer maybe one example I mentioned when we were out with the NAB one team, it could have been any team, reach, lead, or Colleen's group and the outward outreach that they do, they have built this tremendous trust with the individual who was outside and needed support services, including clothing and food and the ability to have a place to go for shelter.",118,,
523,0.97,3994.824,4004.8,"After, they had spent 20 to 40 minutes building trust, the individual that their guard down and they were able to engage with him.",118,,
524,0.97,4004.8,4007.303,"They found out, yes, he does need access to shelter services.",118,,
525,0.97,4007.303,4020.649,He was concerned he was not going to be able to get back into one service . The team spent quite a bit of time trying to reach various shelters on the phone.,118,,
526,0.97,4020.649,4025.121,"Unfortunately, as you can imagine, given our shelters at capacity, they have been stretched thin with Covid.",118,,
527,0.97,4025.121,4057.386,"They had already competing crisis because they have been underfunded for so long, they weren't able to get somebody on the phone because the sheer amount of work many of our shelters and given that our shelters are currently at capacity, I'm wondering under the model you are talking about here, is this a way for the Behind-The-Scenes work to be done by Hsd, so that some of those outreach workers, whatever entity they are with, are not getting a roadblock when they run into somebody.",118,,
528,0.97,4057.386,4059.889,That is perhaps the type of work that can be coordinated Behind-The-Scenes.,118,,
529,0.97,4059.889,4070.299,"That outreach person is continuing to engage in conversation and build that trust so Behind-The-Scenes, they are figuring out how to get that person into housing or temporary shelter, is that the temporary work they would do instead of being in the field with the police presence?",118,,
530,0.97,4070.299,4097.827,"Yeah, that is the general vision of what this new approach would be for this to be a Hub that could coordinate the resources of the city, be it at shelter capacity, be it coordinating Seattle public utilities and deploying hygiene resources, be it--like I said earlier, distributing sharp disposals, purple bag program, just going down the list.",119,,
531,0.97,4097.827,4126.555,"Instead of having a system like the Nava team system, where all of those resources were monopolized by an entity that was also the primary outreach organ of the city, in this system, the only outreach group would be provider based . The only people in the field would be the providers . This team would sort of be, by necessity, have to collaborate with providers on how to distribute those resources.",119,,
532,0.97,4126.555,4177.206,"This marks a massive shift in approach and doctrine from the old model, which combined monopoly on City resources with an outreach team . This does more of a respecting the different Competencies the city and the outreach community bring forward and would add, this division of labor is being forged through these discussions between the executive and provider community, which has been happening in a more intense and Proactive way, from what I can gather from all parties, then what it has in the past, and really brought into focus what the city is uniquely positioned to provide, and what the provider community is uniquely positioned to provide.",119,,
533,0.97,4177.206,4180.91,A lot of the details will start getting field and more once they can stand up.,119,,
534,0.97,4180.91,4182.912,These Ftes.,119,,
535,0.97,4182.912,4216.045,"The critical component is, from the discussions with the executive, a team like this is essential to get a lot of these additive resources that we have appropriated in the summer out in the field, where it can actually be helping folks and provide a degree of city tracking of how those resources are being deployed and making sure they are getting to the providers that need them.",119,,
536,0.97,4216.045,4220.516,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,120,,
537,0.97,4220.516,4242.171,"If there are no other questions, I just want to thank you, Councilmember Lewis, for your leadership on this issue and really express my appreciation for all the work you have been doing, both with the Mayor's office, myself, Councilmember Morales, and the provider community.",120,,
538,0.97,4242.171,4278.407,"I agree with you, there is a new willingness between the provider community and the executive departments to really figure out how to do this differently, instead of the sort of historical approach of concerns about the way the Nava team was functioning on one side, and resistance to making changes to the NAB team function on the other.",120,,
539,0.97,4278.407,4279.808,This is truly a new approach.,120,,
540,0.97,4279.808,4289.218,We have heard deputy Mayor site repeatedly that this new approach is one that leads with outreach.,120,,
541,0.97,4289.218,4311.04,"I think the very best way to see met that philosophy is by supporting the efforts of our professional outreach providers to do this work, with again, city staff, acting in a coordinating role to support that work.",120,,
542,0.97,4311.04,4347.009,"I think that is a wonderful model . It reminds me a little bit of what the city auditor recommended a couple of years ago with what is called an incident command system approach where again, we have folks who have access to resources across the city, across many different departments, who are coordinating with the folks in the field to address the needs of people at specific critical incidents, in this case, locations.",120,,
543,0.97,4347.009,4393.822,"I was really dismayed at the end of September, when we heard from the executive that they were disbanding the NAV team, but in the description of the next steps, there was nothing said about how they intend to Reallocate the funding as the Council included in our legislation and we balanced budget how they were going to Reallocate that $1.4 million to outreach contracts, housing navigation services, case management, and financial assistance . We felt, I think the Council felt really strongly.",120,,
544,0.97,4393.822,4412.841,"We did not just want to get rid of the NAV team without getting something new and appreciate, again, you're pulling everybody together, Councilmember Lewis, to make sure everything happens and looking forward to taking a look at the newest version of the updated proviso.",120,,
545,0.97,4412.841,4419.982,Thanks again . I have a second reason this morning to feel optimistic.,120,,
546,0.97,4419.982,4428.924,"[Laughter] all right, moving forward to our next Speaker, that would be Councilmember Morales.",120,,
547,0.97,4428.924,4433.162,Take it away.,120,,
548,0.97,4433.162,4440.569,Thank you Council President Tim . I do want to thank Councilmember Lewis.,121,,
549,0.97,4440.569,4448.377,It has been very interesting conversations we've had over the last several weeks.,121,,
550,0.97,4448.377,4478.807,"I agree, it seems there is a fundamental shift in willingness from the executive office based on the conversations we've been having with deputy Mayor to really think more carefully about the really important work that our service providers are doing in terms of outreach and making sure we Censor them and put forth their work and their relationships, and real engagement on the ground.",121,,
551,0.97,4478.807,4486.114,Looking forward to this conversation about how we deploy resources for the rest of 2020.,121,,
552,0.97,4486.114,4496.525,"Then, moving on, we are in the middle of the beginning of conversations about what 2021 should look like.",121,,
553,0.97,4496.525,4498.36,That will be the next round of conversations.,121,,
554,0.97,4498.36,4503.999,"This afternoon, there are five get engaged appointees from the community economic development committee.",121,,
555,0.97,4503.999,4522.951,"I am looking forward to getting those folks confirmed . Yasmine Aceves from the Lgbtq mission, Chelise Jacobson, Racquel West.",121,,
556,0.97,4522.951,4537.566,"I want to thank Councilmember Juarez for the work she has been doing on getting land transferred from sound transit for the youth achievement center, as we talked about a few times here already.",121,,
557,0.97,4537.566,4554.883,"This will be a really important and significant piece of the broader strategy in the South end for addressing restorative justice, mentoring, getting young people on the right path and providing better access to opportunity for them.",121,,
558,0.97,4554.883,4567.462,This achievement center is one piece of that and we are really excited about the opportunity to secure that land so we can move forward with the rest of the planning there.,121,,
559,0.97,4567.462,4574.87,"Last week, I visited Encampments in Georgetown with an outreach coordinator from reach.",121,,
560,0.97,4574.87,4594.222,"I was able to hear from our In- House neighbors first hand, their request for hygiene services, enhanced shelter, access to water, and for the city to focus its priority on supporting agencies like reach and others that house neighbors's trusts.",121,,
561,0.97,4594.222,4609.705,I was also able to visit with Rick college he in Georgetown to hear about concerns and talk about the impact on their business and how we can work Collaboratively to address some of the issues in the area.,121,,
562,0.97,4609.705,4618.146,I will be going back to Soto to have similar conversations with businesses and with our In- House neighbors there this week.,121,,
563,0.97,4618.146,4636.531,"Last week, I also met with neighbors from beacon Hill, discussed air and noise pollution . If you don't know, the beacon Hill neighborhood has impacted flight that occurs every 90 seconds, with decimal levels between 70 and 90.",121,,
564,0.97,4636.531,4647.476,"The population in beacon Hill is 72% people of color 44% immigrants, one of for our poor.",121,,
565,0.97,4647.476,4655.55,There are quite clear health disparities and climate disparities for folks who live on beacon Hill.,121,,
566,0.97,4655.55,4660.255,The court has a mitigation program to alleviate noise.,121,,
567,0.97,4660.255,4671.266,"Unfortunately, folks in the beacon Hill neighborhood aren't eligible for that program, despite the adverse health and environmental impacts on community members.",121,,
568,0.97,4671.266,4687.682,"So, they are asking for our support to allow neighbors to participate in the--I believe it is a relatively new equity community advisory committee report so they can provide meaningful input to the port of Seattle.",121,,
569,0.97,4687.682,4691.086,We will be working with neighbors to try to facilitate that.,121,,
570,0.97,4691.086,4705.133,"Last week, as I mentioned, we shifted our office hours during budget from 3:00 to 5:00.",121,,
571,0.97,4705.133,4721.483,"Yesterday, I had conversations with constituents around affordable housing, how we help our homeless neighbors, in addition to how we can respond to gun violence and I am sure everyone knows we have had several related tragic events in the last several weeks . We are talking with neighbors about what they would like to see city council doom.",121,,
572,0.97,4721.483,4730.559,Folks who want to have conversations with our office can sign up for office hours on the Council Website.,121,,
573,0.97,4730.559,4744.172,"We also this week will be launching what we call front yard Ballrooms . These will be small, socially distant outdoor meetings with neighbors so we can hear directly from them.",121,,

575,0.97,4751.78,4787.015,"Finally, I am looking forward to my conversation tomorrow evening with girl scouts from the South end . They are earning their democracy badges . I will be listening to their questions and sharing information about how local government works and I am looking forward to talking with young girls, young leaders in our neighborhood and convincing them to think, maybe it is not for 10 years, but certainly put in the idea in their head that they can someday run for office as well.",121,,
576,0.97,4787.015,4788.817,"That is all I have, colleagues.",121,,

584,0.97,4836.798,4852.047,I can imagine the front forms are another feature to help constituents.,122,,
585,0.97,4852.047,4854.149,Thank you everyone who sent in information from Townhall meetings.,122,,
586,0.97,4854.149,4855.717,"Also impressive, I know these are ongoing discussions.",122,,

644,0.97,5222.417,5266.761,"-- and of course Councilmember Herbold's office which has been providing detailed information on--we will schedule a briefing on the West Seattle bridge definitely at our next--Wednesday, December 2 before the time we might work with the Council President office to schedule a briefing on the cost benefits analysis or other key issues happening during the budget I know I sound like a broken record on this but this crisis situation with the West Seattle bridge combined with the report from our city auditor on the EEG condition of our bridges makes a strong argument for increasing the funding for bridge maintenance during this budget cycle.",126,,
645,0.97,5266.761,5279.507,Regarding the navigation team announcement this morning I want to thank Councilmember Lewis is chair on--to craft a compromise on this issue.,126,,

655,0.97,5392.687,5435.863,"I also wanted to ask, thank you for letting me have a quick clarification, we do need to have proposals from Councilmembers be self budgeting eventually, but form B's do not actually have to be self budgeting, they require a Cosponsorship and I have--on the line here, but I just want to offer a quick second if I may to offer verification because I Miss spoke earlier so do note that we are trying to Hone in and will eventually need those forms to be self balancing but if I may, Allie is available to offer clarification on what form B's need to include.",128,,
656,0.97,5435.863,5441.035,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda.,129,,
657,0.97,5441.035,5444.439,Allie do you want to Chime in here?,129,,
658,0.97,5444.439,5500.728,"I think the chair just summed it up well, form B's do not to need to be self balancing however they can be but they do require two cosponsors in addition to the primary sponsor to be included on the agenda and for discussion in Committee, and then following the form B submission those proposals will be discussed on the 28th through the 30th and then we will work with--following that are form C's which are required to be self bouncing so again form B's are not required to be self balancing but you are welcome to submit ideas for how to fund those proposals that will help inform the chairs back in as we move into those discussions in a couple of weeks.",130,,
659,0.97,5500.728,5506.2,Any questions from anybody here about that?,131,,
660,0.97,5506.2,5508.236,All right.,131,,
661,0.97,5508.236,5516.544,If I may and also go back and ask Councilmember Pedersen a question about his presentation.,132,,
662,0.97,5516.544,5531.025,Thank you so much could you remind us what type of information is being announced today I know that--alluded to it a little bit as well is there --,132,,
663,0.97,5531.025,5545.539,"The cost benefit analysis which is just one piece of information that will be used to decide the best course of action, that Cost-Benefit analysis will be available this week sometime.",133,,
664,0.97,5545.539,5552.38,It is not so much an announcement it is a sharing of information.,134,,
665,0.97,5552.38,5564.091,"And it is one of the inputs as Councilmember Peterson explained, one of many inputs that is going into a decision to be made by the Mayor.",134,,
666,0.97,5564.091,5566.761,Thank you very much.,135,,
667,0.97,5566.761,5570.798,All right.,136,,
668,0.97,5570.798,5596.223,"Seeing no hands from my colleagues, I will go into my presentation for the day, as I usually do I will start with the report from the Seattle fire Department on their Covid- 19 tests, being administered at four sites throughout the city since June 5 up through October 17.",136,,
669,0.97,5596.223,5612.64,"The Seattle fire Department at least four different locations have administered 266,900 and 56 tests to folks throughout the city.",136,,
670,0.97,5612.64,5624.852,Really appreciate the work of Seattle fire Department and the innovation of providing this testing geographically throughout the city.,136,,
671,0.97,5624.852,5638.466,"From the human services Department just want to remind everybody that this Thursday, October 27 22 is purple Thursday a day that we are asked to honor and stand in solidarity with survivors of domestic violence by wearing purple.",136,,
672,0.97,5638.466,5661.989,October is domestic violence awareness month which the human services Department and the office of labor standards has recognized as a time to recognize--to raise awareness about violence and its effect on families and communities and to acknowledge and highlight those working to end Gender-Based violence.,136,,
673,0.97,5661.989,5667.762,In Washington state 41% of women and 32% of men reported experiencing violence from an intimate partner.,136,,
674,0.97,5667.762,5681.876,"The city of Seattle invest more than $10 million annually in community programming focused on Gender-Based violence through these investments,--support more than 10,000 survivors every year.",136,,
675,0.97,5681.876,5696.991,"While domestic violence does not discriminate, language barriers, lack of relevant services, and fear of isolation put marginalized communities at an increased risk of experiencing Gender-Based violence.",136,,
676,0.97,5696.991,5722.75,Women of color and native women are--if you or someone you know you can call chat or text 24 hours every day at the National domestic violence Hotline at 800-799-7233.,136,,
677,0.97,5722.75,5734.562,Just a little bit more about the West Seattle bridge in addition to the release of the Cost-Benefit analysis.,136,,
678,0.97,5734.562,5747.341,This week just want to share with folks who participated in the survey that I did starting on October 12.,136,,
679,0.97,5747.341,5748.976,And running through 7 P.M.,136,,
680,0.97,5748.976,5751.178,On October 14.,136,,
681,0.97,5751.178,5769.897,I conducted an Online survey asking folks whether or not people supported a repair which then of course involves the continued planning for an eventual replacement or moving straight to the replacement of the West Seattle bridge.,136,,
682,0.97,5769.897,5843.437,"I have provided some summary baseline information about information that we had clean so far about the Cost-Benefit analysis on values such as impacts to residents, impacts to small business, impacts to workers, as well as concerns around the cost of a solution as well as the maintenance cost of the solution these are all inputs that are part of the Cost-Benefit analysis that we are working to put up sort of a value on all of these attributes associated with the different options, and the survey was not a scientific survey, and the geographic responses were not necessarily representative of district 1 overall, but I do think it is useful for receiving feedback from constituents at this point in time, much like the Mayor is receiving feedback from constituents through the West Seattle community task force.",136,,
683,0.97,5843.437,5846.874,So I really appreciate everybody who participated as of 7 P.M.,136,,
684,0.97,5846.874,5850.344,On October 14.,136,,
685,0.97,5850.344,5857.184,"Approximately 7000 people had participated by that time, 59.8% favored repair.",136,,
686,0.97,5857.184,5868.395,"36% supported replacement, and about 4.2% supported, either did not know or supported another option.",136,,
687,0.97,5868.395,5902.329,"39% of the replies were from zip code 98116, and that is the zip code for this North and West Seattle, and thanks to--we have sort of a breakdown of the different responses in different zip codes, and it is very interesting to see how in some zip codes there is stronger support for a repair and in some zip codes there is stronger repair support for a replacement.",136,,
688,0.97,5902.329,5937.865,"Moving on to another topic that was a hot topic last week was the issue of separations from the Seattle police Department separations are typically either retiring, a lateral move to another Department, or a resignation, and we heard last week that the executive shared information about the number of separations received through the end of September.",136,,
689,0.97,5937.865,5951.412,"Just as background, the Council by statement of legislative intent, has sort of a standing request for monthly staffing reports that provide this information.",136,,
690,0.97,5951.412,5956.15,We have not received the monthly staffing reports since February.,136,,
691,0.97,5956.15,5982.076,"I did because of Covid-19 give the Department permission to report less frequently than monthly, but again, we have not received any reports at all since the February report and going into budget I knew that this was really important for the Council to get this information.",136,,
692,0.97,5982.076,5990.884,"So even before the budget process began, I have been asking the budget office since September 13 and the police Department since September 16.",136,,
693,0.97,5990.884,6010.003,"And because I was not receiving it I did request information through Sharepoint, that is the process for viewing public by which the Council asks questions of the Department during the budget process as a way to streamline the ability of the executive to provide this information.",136,,
694,0.97,6010.003,6048.175,"I made a request on October 1, the information we received sometime after that date identified that through August 20 even though the information was given to us after October 1, they still were only reporting through the end of August, and at that time we were at for the year a separation of 63 fully trained officers, and that include 16 resignations, four retirements, two Terminations, and one death.",136,,
695,0.97,6048.175,6061.488,"The Sharepoint information only gave information through August, although again because I did not receive it until sometime after October 1, presumably they did have September information.",136,,
696,0.97,6061.488,6093.487,"And then the Sharepoint information gave a projection of future separations through November, and they only projected another 21 separations, and based on those projections, received just a couple weeks ago, the executive was projecting a total of 84 separations for the entire year of 2020.",136,,
697,0.97,6093.487,6107.701,Even though the annual estimate of separations that we received at the start of the year was 92 separations.,136,,
698,0.97,6107.701,6113.74,So for context in 2018 there were 109 separations and in 2019 there were 92.,136,,
699,0.97,6113.74,6124.751,The 2020 Council Rebalanced budget estimated another 30 above the annual projection of 92 for a total of 122 separations for 2020.,136,,
700,0.97,6124.751,6149.943,"So I think that is an important number to hold onto, this number of 122 separations, that was the number that the Council projected during its summer Rebalanced budget that we would see for the entirety of the year of 2020.",136,,
701,0.97,6149.943,6182.609,"As it relates to actually the reasons for separation, there are exit interviews that are done for individual officers when they leave, and I believe central staff receives that information, I am not actually going to ask central staff to review that information for October or for September, because I know we are really bogged down in budget, but this is really important information to have that level of detail so I think that is something that we should take a look at.",136,,
702,0.97,6182.609,6206.133,"But I do understand from the statements that the Southwest precinct captain has made about what is going on in the Department, that many of the officers that chief Diaz deployed from specialty units to patrol are the ones that left the Department September.",136,,
703,0.97,6206.133,6272.399,"I support chief Diaz is strong leadership--to patrol where they are needed most, and I do just want to say that officers who do not want to follow their chief in those changes that he identified as best for the Department and best for the city might find more job satisfaction elsewhere as it relates to officers who left for other reasons, I really understand that working for months at a time, managing multiple crises has made this a really hard year for workers on the front lines as a comparison as of August there were 45 Seattle fire Department separations but at the beginning of the year we were anticipating only 38 Seattle fire Department separations for the year, so just like we are seeing in the police Department, we are seeing more people leave the fire Department than we had anticipated in the beginning of the year.",136,,
704,0.97,6272.399,6338.465,"Again receiving this information from the executive is really important it allows us to keep an eye on it it is important to understand the reasons why officers are leaving it is also important to recognize that one month's data does not make a trend, the separations projected for 2020 at the start of the year was 92 officers, the September numbers bring us to 18 more than the entire year's annual projections not including the additional estimate that the Council had, the additional 30 officers, this number also includes six officers who were terminated and one who has died, typically terminated or deceased officers are not included in the annual projections, so that number, that 92 number for the start of the year did not include an estimate for terminated officers or deceased officers.",136,,
705,0.97,6338.465,6364.991,"I am really glad to have learned that the Mayor's office is working hard to finalize the contracts for the Council's $4 million allocated in the 2020 Rebalanced budget for community safety programs with an aim to scale up and expand contracts and services as soon as possible this is critically important to work on further support financial support from the city to do this violence prevention work, there is another $10 million that the Council allocated for mental health professionals.",136,,
