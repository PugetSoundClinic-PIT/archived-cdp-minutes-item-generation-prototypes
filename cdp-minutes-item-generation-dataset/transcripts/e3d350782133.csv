23,0.97,84.384,85.018,Nine present.,17,,
24,0.97,85.018,86.519,Thank you Madam clerk.,18,,
25,0.97,86.519,88.655,Thank you for the robust discussion yesterday.,18,,
26,0.97,88.655,98.064,We're going to engage in a very long discussion today and I will make sure that we get an hour break before lunch and we will end by 5:00.,18,,
27,0.97,98.064,101.367,"With your help, we can perhaps end a little early like yesterday.",18,,
28,0.97,101.367,105.905,There are some item that's will require a little longer discussion and some that don't.,18,,
29,0.97,105.905,107.24,I hope it will balance out.,18,,
30,0.97,107.24,113.48,But we will give it--we will let you know if we need to do the two-minute role later in the meeting today.,18,,
31,0.97,113.48,122.155,I think if we get through the various amendments plus public testimony that leaves nine minutes for the amendments.,18,,
32,0.97,122.155,124.39,I know not all will need that time.,18,,
33,0.97,124.39,128.394,I have confidence we can get through this and appreciate your time in advance.,18,,
34,0.97,128.394,155.355,Before we consider the Ageneral Darks a reminder for everyone that most of the conversation we had yesterday was around all of the forms.,18,,
35,0.97,175.542,184.217,"Whether it has been discussed with residents, Stakeholders and if you need it whether it was reviewed by law.",19,,
36,0.97,184.217,191.224,The conversation right now on potential walk on amendments is not about whether or not we as individual Council members like the proposal.,19,,
37,0.97,191.224,205.772,It is about whether or not we find it meritorious and for the purposes to amend the agenda whether it has enough information in front of us to discuss the proposal give then it did not meet the original deadline.,19,,
38,0.97,205.772,214.08,"Just because the proposal may not be deemed right for today's conversation, if it does not receive sufficient votes, that does not mean that the conversation is over.",19,,
39,0.97,214.08,225.158,We still have the form cs which will help change or identify different balancing techniques in the counsel's proposed budget.,19,,
40,0.97,225.158,237.804,"With that, I want to say yesterday's conversation was very helpful as we identified potential questions or issues as we consider Walk-On amendments and the other form BS that were submitted on time.",19,,
41,0.97,237.804,242.609,I am aware of at least one Walk- on amendment.,19,,
42,0.97,242.609,244.243,It was circulated by 5:00 P.M.,19,,
43,0.97,244.243,250.25,So today our conversation will be around whether or not it has a simple majority of Council members to be considered to amend the agenda.,19,,
44,0.97,250.25,261.961,"But for the purposes of our recorded meeting here, I want to make sure that we go through the process and get clarification from the clerk that it was indeed circulated by 5:00.",19,,
45,0.97,261.961,265.999,Council member Pedersen I believe you have one amendment.,19,,
46,0.97,265.999,272.305,Amendment number 1. I'm going to ask the clerk verify if it was circulated by 5:00 P.M.,19,,
47,0.97,272.305,274.007,On the preceding business day.,19,,
48,0.97,274.007,278.444,Madam clerk was amendment 1 circulated by 5:00 P.M.,19,,
49,0.97,278.444,280.413,"Yes, chairman Mosqueda it was.",20,,
50,0.97,280.413,280.747,Excellent.,21,,
51,0.97,280.747,282.749,Thank you very much Madam clerk.,21,,
52,0.97,282.749,286.386,Council member Pedersen I'll turn it over to you make the motion for consideration.,21,,
53,0.97,286.386,288.454,"Thank you, chairman Mosqueda.",22,,
54,0.97,288.454,306.105,I move to amend the agenda today by adding city wide Walk- on amendment 1 for Nonrepresentative employees earning 80% or more of Seattle median income placing it on the agenda after item 1.,22,,
55,0.97,306.105,306.639,Thank you.,23,,
56,0.97,306.639,307.807,It has been moved.,23,,
57,0.97,307.807,309.876,Is there a second.,24,,
58,0.97,309.876,310.209,Second.,25,,
59,0.97,310.209,313.012,Its been moved and Seconded.,26,,
60,0.97,313.012,315.081,Thank you very much Council member Pedersen.,26,,
61,0.97,315.081,320.62,I'm going it town it over to you for a brief overview before folks ask any questions that they may have.,26,,
62,0.97,320.62,322.989,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",27,,
63,0.97,322.989,337.837,I'm simply asking you to consider this amendment as a potential viable option to immediately generate savings that we could redeploy to many good proposals we have put forward to add to the budget.,27,,
64,0.97,337.837,339.572,Affirm decision is not needed today.,27,,
65,0.97,339.572,348.114,"Once we get the revised forecast in a couple of weeks and hear the rest of the additions being proposed today and tomorrow, we can decide whether the option is actually needed.",27,,
66,0.97,348.114,362.729,"This is an opportunity to redeploy millions of additional dollars to shelter those experiencing homelessness, to invest more in Seattle's communities and fix our crumbling Intrastructure.",27,,
67,0.97,362.729,373.339,During this time of back to back deficits this proposal would apply to just the planned salary increases for next year and for just the higher paid Nonrepresented city government employees.,27,,
68,0.97,373.339,383.049,So many people in Seattle are out of jobs and our city has such deep needs I personally don't think it is time to increase the pay of our city government employees again.,27,,
69,0.97,383.049,386.419,I don't think this proposal is about posterity.,27,,
70,0.97,386.419,389.856,That is when you're spending less money.,27,,
71,0.97,389.856,394.761,But the Mayor's budget is spending the same as last year and we're hoping Tâ–ˆO add to that.,27,,
72,0.97,394.761,403.302,The real posterity is when we don't provide more money when we can to help those who are literally sleeping on the streets every night.,27,,
73,0.97,403.302,412.378,I think they should get the hands into the most vulnerable and address our aging infrastructure instead of putting more money in our own pockets.,27,,
74,0.97,412.378,416.516,We can use the funds to save city jobs and prevent layoffs.,27,,
75,0.97,416.516,421.721,Thank you for considering this as potentially an option.,27,,
76,0.97,421.721,425.358,Thank you very much Council member Pedersen.,28,,
77,0.97,425.358,429.829,"As a reminder, we are not considering the details or the policy proposal itself.",28,,
78,0.97,429.829,435.968,The merits of whether or not the criteria was metaphor Walk- on today is what we're considering.,28,,
79,0.97,435.968,440.506,A summary sheet was sent to all of you.,28,,
80,0.97,440.506,445.812,"Was it reviewed by law, departments, Stakeholders, et cetera.",28,,
81,0.97,445.812,449.182,So perhaps I will offer the following.,28,,
82,0.97,449.182,453.085,The proposal that was sent around did meet the 5:00 P.M.,28,,
83,0.97,453.085,453.352,Deadline.,28,,
84,0.97,453.352,456.722,"It was reviewed by central staff, yes.",28,,
85,0.97,456.722,458.291,It was reviewed by law.,28,,
86,0.97,458.291,463.429,And the specific members of our legal team are indicated as well.,28,,
87,0.97,463.429,467.066,And the Department was consulted with.,28,,
88,0.97,467.066,472.171,The answer around Stakeholders yesterday you will remember that I asked about specific Stakeholders.,28,,
89,0.97,472.171,476.676,The proposal does not appear to have a specific Stakeholder item listed.,28,,
90,0.97,476.676,482.114,Though residents of Seattle was listed.,28,,
91,0.97,482.114,485.384,"Again, that's not necessarily an indication of not supporting.",28,,
92,0.97,485.384,492.692,"I just want today NOTE just like yesterday even though the Department in that case wasn't consulted with, we can always get additional information.",28,,
93,0.97,492.692,503.302,"But those three categories were marked yes, law, yes, central staff and yes CBO has spoken with the proposed sponsor.",28,,
94,0.97,503.302,506.672,Are there any questions for the proposed sponsor here?,28,,
95,0.97,506.672,507.974,Council member Sawant.,29,,
96,0.97,507.974,510.042,Good morning.,30,,
97,0.97,510.042,511.811,"And thank you, chairman Mosqueda.",30,,
98,0.97,511.811,512.678,I don't have questions.,30,,
99,0.97,512.678,538.337,"But I just wanted to clarify for members of the public watching this that I will be voting in favor of adding this proposal to the agenda because I think all budget proposals amendment proposals should be discussed, supported or opposed on political merits and not procedural reasons.",30,,
100,0.97,538.337,547.613,That's why I am voting yes but I don't support the specific proposal and when it comes for for discussion later I will explain why.,30,,
101,0.97,547.613,551.317,I'm not seeing any additional hands.,31,,
102,0.97,551.317,567.5,Council member Pedersen I also would be interested in whether or not there are other departments that you were able to check in with Besides CPO and CBO on the cover sheet which is Posh important because it meets the criteria.,31,,
103,0.97,567.5,572.171,If you have thoughts now you can share them or save that as well for the discussion.,31,,
104,0.97,572.171,577.476,Assuming this gets on the agenda.,31,,
105,0.97,577.476,580.68,It was central staff law and CBO only.,32,,
106,0.97,580.68,581.38,Thank you.,33,,
107,0.97,581.38,581.681,All right.,33,,
108,0.97,581.681,587.453,I'm not seeing any additional questions.,33,,
109,0.97,587.453,598.264,"With that, let's go ahead and ask the clerk, Madam clerk, will you please call the role on the adoption of amendment 1 to the agenda.",33,,

166,0.97,715.981,719.585,At this time we will turn to public comment.,77,,
167,0.97,719.585,722.388,We do have 14 folks signed up for public comment.,77,,
168,0.97,722.388,727.793,We have committed to 30 minutes at the beginning of each of our meetings.,77,,
169,0.97,727.793,730.362,We will give folks two minutes allotted time.,77,,

173,0.97,779.945,783.649,"How, good morning.",78,,
174,0.97,783.649,785.151,Hi.,79,,
175,0.97,785.151,785.417,Hi.,80,,
176,0.97,785.417,789.355,I think I'm Unmuted.,81,,
177,0.97,789.355,790.489,You're great.,82,,
178,0.97,790.489,805.938,District 7. Seattle community police Commission at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars is now engaged in formulating bylaws and a strategic plan despite having clearly articulated mandates from the Federal court and in Seattle city law.,83,,
179,0.97,805.938,811.977,And they are doing this over seven and a half years after they first started meeting.,83,,
180,0.97,811.977,814.58,Seven and a half years.,83,,
181,0.97,814.58,829.395,"The CPC is doing this by hiring professionals by prohibiting public comment, ignoring mandate for five years and holding public forum and ignoring mandates to have youth representation on the Commission.",83,,
182,0.97,829.395,837.203,The CPC ignored the murder of Smith in 2019 and failed to take note of the SPD murder of Eric when it happened in May of this year.,83,,
183,0.97,837.203,843.809,Both of these were murders by SPD of black men in severe mental health crisis.,83,,
184,0.97,843.809,858.557,All of this is indicative of a bureaucratic approach that relies on paying professionals to tell a community police Commission what to do instead of actually listening to the community.,83,,
185,0.97,858.557,866.198,"Council members, please support coups member Sawant's proposal to develop a true community based independent police oversight entity.",83,,
186,0.97,866.198,870.236,Stop the pretense that we have oversight.,83,,
187,0.97,870.236,884.717,Stop the Bifurcation of having the Commission and a Pseudo-But not really independent office of professional accountability.,83,,
188,0.97,884.717,885.017,Thank you.,83,,
189,0.97,885.017,892.258,"Thank you, the next person is Kate.",84,,
190,0.97,892.258,893.192,"Good morning, Kate.",84,,
191,0.97,893.192,894.193,Good morning.,85,,

200,0.97,953.552,961.293,We are bracing for a tsunami of Evictions upon the end of the moratorium.,85,,
201,0.97,961.293,969.301,Without funding the Eviction Ourts will be flooded and many tenants will self Evict without the humiliation of going to court.,85,,
202,0.97,969.301,983.682,"Community based organizations like the tenants unions and others need funds to connect Renters with resources, provide education and organize to make sure that they receive fair treatment from landlords and are housed during the pandemic.",85,,

219,0.97,1049.448,1052.951,The OPA is not working for people of this city.,89,,
220,0.97,1052.951,1060.759,The makeup of OPA is--has only two civilian investigators and nine SPD sergeants.,89,,
221,0.97,1060.759,1065.631,We need an elected civilian controlled accountability system.,89,,
222,0.97,1065.631,1073.205,I urge that you support Council member Sawant's proposal to finally create this system to hold police accountable.,89,,
223,0.97,1073.205,1088.887,"This proposal would enable the city of Seattle to establish an independent elected community oversight board with full powers over police accountable, including the power to investigate reports of excessive force and racially Biased policing.",89,,
224,0.97,1088.887,1093.158,To subpoena witnesses and evidence and to fire or otherwise discipline officers as needed.,89,,

245,0.97,1256.722,1271.303,"As an involved and concerned community member, I have watched and attended forums where our current organization CPC and OPA has failed time and again to question challenge engage or execute their mission of police accountability.",95,,
246,0.97,1271.303,1277.075,To say the system is broken is to imply that it ever worked and that would be false.,95,,
247,0.97,1277.142,1291.39,Ccountability bodies like the CPC and OPA have consistently be Dysfunctional in part because each party has little or no accountability power and uses current or former s PD officers to get information.,95,,
248,0.97,1291.39,1306.171,It is imperative that we have an actual accountability body developed with practices and powers to better protect those most impacted by systemic racism from police brutality and use of deadly force.,95,,

255,0.97,1353.385,1359.725,Firefighters serve the people of Seattle by providing world class fire suppression and emergency medical care.,97,,
256,0.97,1359.725,1363.061,We take great personal risks in doing so.,97,,
257,0.97,1363.061,1369.568,Seattle firefighters consistently lead the way in fire service as a modern innovative diverse organization.,97,,
258,0.97,1369.568,1378.21,I first want to thank the Mayor for Prioritizing public safety and increasing the budget for two critical issues.,97,,
259,0.97,1378.21,1388.253,The expansion of the health 1 program and a critic increase of fire Department resources ladder 13 and medic 26 to address the West Seattle bridge closure.,97,,
260,0.97,1388.253,1394.292,Firefighters hope the city council Brior advertises these public safety measures as well and supports these issues.,97,,
261,0.97,1394.292,1403.301,"In addition to the budget proposal as written, firefighters ask Council to fund the following priorities on the agenda today.",97,,
262,0.97,1403.301,1404.703,First staffing.,97,,
263,0.97,1404.703,1412.444,Restore the additional 25 firefighter recruits to maintain staffing member for the critical services and programs in the Department as our workload increases.,97,,
264,0.97,1412.444,1423.288,"The demands on firefighters continues to expand due to growth and density of our city, homelessness, the Opioid abuse crisis, the pandemic, Wildfires and more.",97,,
265,0.97,1423.288,1432.197,Firefighters for example have increased our services since the pandemic began by staffing four Covid testing sites in Seattle six days a week.,97,,
266,0.97,1432.197,1440.505,"We have served over 300,000 people in providing those tests.",97,,
267,0.97,1440.505,1447.245,Automatic external Fibril Ators is the second one.,97,,

286,0.97,1509.908,1516.181,The senior planning and development specialist and the climate policy adviser position.,104,,
287,0.97,1516.181,1524.823,Delay in filling these positions in 2022 will limit the activities that are crucially needed to carry out carbon reduction actions.,104,,
288,0.97,1524.823,1532.364,And they would undercut the city's ability to establish climate accountability benchmarks.,104,,

300,0.97,1613.211,1624.956,And I have been following Seattle policing for the past ten years.,106,,
301,0.97,1624.956,1629.794,It hasn't produced meaningful improvement in police attitude or behavior.,106,,
302,0.97,1629.794,1643.441,We have an opportunity now with this budget to begin to move from sales Reforce to the real transformation that we need for peaceful safe and equitable city.,106,,
303,0.97,1643.441,1648.213,We have to change policing but also police accountability.,106,,
304,0.97,1648.213,1656.788,The Seattle accountability structure is inadequate and provides the illusion of police accountability without the reality.,106,,
305,0.97,1656.788,1657.922,It is also opaque.,106,,
306,0.97,1657.922,1662.961,Seattle residents don't really know what it does or what out comes it produces.,106,,
307,0.97,1662.961,1678.943,In the wake of shootings of people in mental health crisis in recent years and extreme police violence towards protesters this summer we have been told repeatedly by authorities like the Mayor and police chief that the OPA is civilian oversight.,106,,
308,0.97,1678.943,1687.619,It is not and it costs millions of dollars every year.,106,,
309,0.97,1687.619,1693.558,Please support Council member Sawant's proposal that could create a new elected accountability structure.,106,,
310,0.97,1693.558,1698.196,We need a body that is transparent and answerable to the people who pay for it.,106,,
311,0.97,1698.196,1701.566,We pay for policing and we deserve much better.,106,,

324,0.97,1749.581,1763.361,I'm well aware I'm standing on the shoulders of this summers many demonstrations and the black lives matter movement which that many Council members supported.,112,,
325,0.97,1763.361,1790.822,All of which Express strong concerns about Seattle's police accountable and problems . I think it should be obviously that our current accountability system does not work for a variety of reasons.,112,,
326,0.97,1790.822,1809.874,"Especially now there couldn't be a better time after the momentum and the interest built this summer to take this on, to create a civilian elected police accountability.",112,,
327,0.97,1809.874,1810.475,Now is the time.,112,,

341,0.97,1899.697,1910.074,They make up for the gap in the--between the crew chief position and the asphalt Raker position.,115,,
342,0.97,1910.074,1930.428,"The asphalt Raker is responsible for measuring the layout of the project, determining the amount of mix to order for the job, coordinating equipment necessary, organize safety setup for Flaggers to state guidelines, leads and Trainas quality Rakers.",115,,
343,0.97,1930.428,1937.568,"Simply put, the crew Chiefs work to plan the job that the 3,000-foot level.",115,,
344,0.97,1937.568,1947.812,The assistant crew chief is the on the ground person who is responsible for coordinating and planning the job.,115,,
345,0.97,1947.812,1955.653,So there's right mix and right people to do everything.,115,,

368,0.97,2066.831,2072.17,For too long earmarked funding by many Council members had sat dormant.,124,,
369,0.97,2072.17,2078.242,Now we have a clear Pathway forward for allocating the funds.,124,,
370,0.97,2078.242,2086.05,By supporting Council member Herbold's budget action to transfer dollars to the contract we can especially sure that Scs becomes a local success.,124,,
371,0.97,2086.05,2102.099,In addition we want to thank Council member Herbold's leadership with a second action to increase funding to provide services to people who use drugs which is a common sense proposal to one of our community's most dire emergencies.,124,,

380,0.97,2184.015,2185.049,"Items 19, 20, 22.",126,,
381,0.97,2185.049,2189.987,Those closest to the problems are closest to the solutions.,126,,
382,0.97,2189.987,2200.364,Communities most harmed by Covid-19 climate injustice and racist and Criminalization and should transform the budget into one that serves all people.,126,,

384,0.97,2209.206,2218.015,However I believe more needs to be done in supporting and Uplifting native communities and especially the tribe.,126,,
385,0.97,2218.015,2222.72,We cannot continue justifying a community that pry pore advertises profit over people.,126,,
386,0.97,2222.72,2227.525,And the Seattle police Department has too much money if you need to get more.,126,,
387,0.97,2227.525,2228.826,Thank you so much.,126,,
388,0.97,2228.826,2230.461,I yield the rest of my time.,126,,

394,0.97,2244.375,2254.118,Would it be helpful for the record if we read in the titles?,127,,
395,0.97,2254.118,2263.728,I believe that would work fine we're on city wide proposal legislation.,128,,
396,0.97,2263.728,2270.201,I would ask if you want to read all of the Roman numerals so we can roll through.,129,,

403,0.97,2297.795,2299.096,That's it for this morning.,132,,
404,0.97,2299.096,2299.73,Thank you.,132,,
405,0.97,2299.73,2302.433,"Thank you, Madam clerk.",133,,
406,0.97,2302.433,2310.074,Thank you for all of the work that you have done over the last now almost six weeks on the proposed budget in front of us.,133,,
407,0.97,2310.074,2312.176,We have quite a bit of discussion to have today.,133,,
408,0.97,2312.176,2315.346,And I'm looking forward to the robust discussion.,133,,
409,0.97,2315.346,2316.947,With us we have Karina bowl.,133,,
410,0.97,2316.947,2319.183,I see you popped right up there.,133,,
411,0.97,2319.183,2328.259,Thank you so much and why don't we go ahead and have you do a quick summary for us on the first item on our agenda.,133,,
412,0.97,2328.259,2330.027,Thank you so much.,134,,
413,0.97,2330.027,2343.207,This would add a total of 2.13 million general fund to distribute among five departments to restore 15 position that's would be eliminated in the 2021 proposed budget for budget reasons.,134,,
414,0.97,2343.207,2355.619,"The five departments are human services Department, office of economic development, office of planning and community development, Seattle Department of transportation, and the Seattle fire Department.",134,,
415,0.97,2355.619,2365.83,This CBA would also impose a proviso on a portion of each of the listed departments budget to restrict use of the funds to solely retaining the positions.,134,,
416,0.97,2365.83,2375.806,"To provide background, the executive provided Council and central staff, a list of employees that would receive layoff notices as part of the proposed budget.",134,,
417,0.97,2375.806,2394.725,Information from city budget office and the departments on the reasons for elimination of these positions indicates that 15 of these layoffs can be characterized as budget reverse us Programatic.,134,,
418,0.97,2394.725,2400.531,And usually identified possible negative impacts to programs and services.,134,,
419,0.97,2400.531,2419.75,In contrast meaning that the position has job duties that are no longer necessary due to a program job duties outside of the city or reasons not relating to budget.,134,,
420,0.97,2419.75,2420.918,And that summarizes the budget action.,134,,
421,0.97,2420.918,2423.687,"Thank you very much, Karina.",135,,
422,0.97,2423.687,2427.091,"Colleagues, this is one of the priority documents that I have put forward.",135,,
423,0.97,2427.091,2433.964,I'm excited to be able to kick off today's discussion about restoring budgetary layoffs.,135,,
424,0.97,2433.964,2436.267,This sets a good tone for the day.,135,,
425,0.97,2436.267,2442.173,And I want to that I Council member Gonzalez and Lewis for their Cosponsr of this.,135,,
426,0.97,2442.173,2450.114,Council member Strauss has signed on this morning and I appreciate their support this well.,135,,
427,0.97,2450.114,2456.854,I support workers rights to make sure there is a strong and thriving local economy.,135,,
428,0.97,2456.854,2462.66,And why do we want to protect against budget layoffs during economic down turn?,135,,
429,0.97,2462.66,2470.801,Because government services and specifically public sector jobs are the back bone to making our economy recover faster.,135,,
430,0.97,2470.801,2472.136,This is not just my opinion.,135,,
431,0.97,2472.136,2472.903,This is a fact.,135,,
432,0.97,2472.903,2488.853,This is what the data shows from economists around the country and around the globe and we heard it as early as this year in May as the Covid crisis began to expose the already existing cracks in our local economy both at the local level and the national and global level.,135,,
433,0.97,2488.853,2494.492,This was the form that was called the economic realities of the Covid crisis which we held in May.,135,,
434,0.97,2494.492,2498.062,"If we were in person, I would be sharing but a Handout right now.",135,,
435,0.97,2498.062,2504.368,So I'm going to share that Handout with you virtually if you will indulge us for a quick second.,135,,
436,0.97,2504.368,2507.738,I want to show the data presented at the forum.,135,,
437,0.97,2507.738,2509.974,Thank you to Pat tee for sharing that information.,135,,
438,0.97,2509.974,2514.078,If you could zoom in a little bit.,135,,
439,0.97,2514.078,2520.518,This is the data from the--in the public interest who presented data from the American progress report.,135,,
440,0.97,2520.518,2537.902,"The original data was pulled from the BLS which shows that by every measure, when state governments and local governments cut public sector jobs or cut public services during a recession by every measure local economies are hurt.",135,,
441,0.97,2537.902,2542.606,It hurts not only the individual that's we're trying to serve by making sure that they have the basic services they need.,135,,
442,0.97,2542.606,2549.046,But it also hurts our ability to recover and it specifically hurts the private sector as well.,135,,
443,0.97,2549.046,2564.929,That's an important take away from the bottom left hand corner in this chart which shows the impact when local governments decide to cut services and jobs.,135,,
444,0.97,2564.929,2586.083,"She says, the idea that government should severely cut spends to deal with an economic downturn is a starve the beast approach but leads to inadequate resources and personnel to meet public needs which then reinforces an Anti- government sentiment by presenting governments as the problem.",135,,
445,0.97,2586.083,2600.664,It can threaten to create a fiscal cycle or growth declines which LOWERS tax revenue and thus further creates Osterity.,135,,
446,0.97,2600.664,2609.073,We are facing the largest and most sudden economic shock in the United States larger than the great depression in terms of job loss.,135,,
447,0.97,2609.073,2626.59,And goes on to explain that state and local governments should consider their responsibility for responding to the crisis because our workers and our services shoulder the support for front line services for lowest wage and most vulnerable residents in our communities.,135,,
448,0.97,2626.59,2630.427,"He WARNS, return to economic recovery will be gradual.",135,,
449,0.97,2630.427,2645.709,"As we have already seen already, it will be in waves which is not only a threat to the economic growth but also a threat to the health of our community and we must have a strategic approach to spend everything that we need to spend on public front line services and those who provide those services.",135,,
450,0.97,2645.709,2649.38,This requires employees to be able to provide these critical services.,135,,
451,0.97,2649.38,2658.956,"He conclude that's when local governments preserve spending and employment, the economy recovers faster and the unemployment rate recovers faster and job growth was faster.",135,,
452,0.97,2658.956,2664.161,He notes it is an obvious policy choice.,135,,
453,0.97,2664.161,2672.202,"And Lastly, because if you haven't seen the form we are going to put up the link to that form.",135,,
454,0.97,2672.202,2681.845,"If city slashed funding during this economic crisis it could take even longer to recover from the economic downturn, prolong unemployment and this should be our greatest economic fear.",135,,
455,0.97,2681.845,2693.357,This is the responsibility of public policy makers now to look for ways to make investments in the local economy in times of economic League.,135,,
456,0.97,2693.357,2695.159,This is recognized already by this Council.,135,,
457,0.97,2695.159,2698.662,We passed the jump start progressive revenue proposal.,135,,
458,0.97,2698.662,2706.537,"This Council put a spending plan together that allocated around 60 million to preserve city services, carts and by extension city jobs.",135,,
459,0.97,2706.537,2714.945,"And we recognize that we might not be able to protect every single city job, including when there's policy or directional change.",135,,
460,0.97,2714.945,2719.116,That is not the case with these potential budgetary cuts in front of us.,135,,
461,0.97,2719.116,2722.052,That is what this form B aims to restore.,135,,
462,0.97,2722.052,2723.887,There is money in the budget.,135,,
463,0.97,2723.887,2739.87,"There was money in the budget to save these vital services and jobs and make sure that we ward off against unnecessary cuts, especially to members of the community by workers as you see noted in the central South summary.",135,,
464,0.97,2739.87,2745.042,"Colleagues, this is one of my top priorities that I look forward to working with you on.",135,,
465,0.97,2745.042,2761.125,"Not only is this the back bone Informer what helps an economy recover faster, this is the back bone of the framework that I want to bring to the budget priorities in the 2020 cycle.",135,,
466,0.97,2761.125,2766.93,"One, city employment needs people preserving--means fewer people that will rely on our safety net.",135,,
467,0.97,2766.93,2775.639,"Second, the people that have money in their pockets by being able to keep jobs are more likely to spend it in our local economy.",135,,
468,0.97,2775.639,2777.875,City employees provide vital services.,135,,
469,0.97,2777.875,2790.754,The data shows the services and support they provide to our residents of our city right now helps to make sure that our recovery will grow faster and that the disparity that we currently see will be less severe.,135,,
470,0.97,2790.754,2794.725,Hsd has noted that the layoff that's are being proposed would not result in less work.,135,,
471,0.97,2794.725,2806.069,In fact that work would be spread across other staff members increasing workload amongst an already stressed out workforce.,135,,
472,0.97,2806.069,2809.706,"Fourth, typically first in first out results in the most diverse employees being let go.",135,,
473,0.97,2809.706,2814.511,And we want to make sure we're not doing this in this cycle as you can see as well.,135,,
474,0.97,2814.511,2826.223,"It is apparent that the two Sdot representative positions we're looking to restore, those familiar with the positions cat Goerize them as growth positions.",135,,
475,0.97,2826.223,2828.392,And offered other positions.,135,,
476,0.97,2828.392,2831.228,These are predominantly staffed by people of color.,135,,
477,0.97,2831.228,2840.304,"Finally, five, we want to keep people employed because we know the institutional knowledge creates greater efficiency amongst city programs.",135,,
478,0.97,2840.304,2851.615,They have also noted that one of their potential layoffs is an employee that will not be absorbed and that individual in this position helps guide Policy-Based and practices that are rare.,135,,
479,0.97,2851.615,2856.853,We want to make sure that those--that institutional knowledge is being able to be maintained.,135,,
480,0.97,2856.853,2872.202,We heard that same thing from Ian who testified today about how that position is being slate today be cut actually creates that connective tissue between various services and losing that position could be really a detriment.,135,,
481,0.97,2872.202,2895.592,"I know I went longer than we usually D I appreciate that you have given me the extra time for considering this proposal give then it shapes the framework that I'm hoping to bring to this conversation around the budget and our concerns around how we can get our economy back and running as fast as possible with that, I will stop myself and ask if there are any additional questions or comments.",135,,
482,0.97,2895.592,2899.162,"Thank you, Patty, for sharing the screen.",135,,
483,0.97,2899.162,2901.465,"Well, I appreciate all of the silence.",135,,
484,0.97,2901.465,2906.57,"Don't see any additional--Oh, please go ahead Council member Sawant.",135,,
485,0.97,2906.57,2906.937,Thank you.,136,,
486,0.97,2906.937,2913.243,I support this amendment to stop the Mayor's proposed layoffs of Seattle of city workers.,136,,
487,0.97,2913.243,2921.218,"With he need to be clear that the layoffs are a tiny, tiny fraction of the budget cuts in the budget of the Mayor.",136,,
488,0.97,2921.218,2925.822,In almost Department the budget cuts are to what is called the capital budget that.,136,,
489,0.97,2925.822,2928.425,Is the budget for things like construction and maintenance.,136,,
490,0.97,2928.425,2942.739,"Because all of that construction is contracted out, the layoffs are overwhelmingly to not city of Seattle workers, public sector workers but construction workers hired out by the contractors.",136,,
491,0.97,2942.739,2966.129,So activists and working people who want an alternative to the--to what is proposed by Mayor Durkan budget cuts must look to the facts and not allow elected officials claim that their hands are clean and they're eliminating layoffs while behind the scenes actually Unfortunately hundreds or maybe thousands may end up losing their jobs.,136,,
492,0.97,2966.129,2971.535,In the time the Mayor has clashed $200 million from the city budget.,136,,
493,0.97,2971.535,2977.908,City Council and central staff analyzed the difference in general Fund and found a $27 million difference.,136,,
494,0.97,2977.908,3001.331,"Once you account for all of the other sources of funding like the real estate excise task, the cuts is well over $200 million my office and the people's budget movement have proposed increasing the rate of the Amazon tax to eliminate all of that, all of those cuts.",136,,
495,0.97,3001.331,3010.14,Unfortunately so far no other Council member has agreed to support that proposal so it will not be discussed during the form BS that requires three cosponsors.,136,,
496,0.97,3010.14,3014.745,But they will have an opportunity before the final vote of the budget in November.,136,,
497,0.97,3014.745,3019.75,So I really urge Council members to look at that very seriously.,136,,
498,0.97,3019.75,3025.288,And also my office will be bringing that proposal forward for the final budget quotes in November.,136,,
499,0.97,3025.288,3028.992,I'm definitely in support of this budget amendment.,136,,
500,0.97,3028.992,3033.997,But also point out it restores 1% of the Mayor's proposed budget cuts.,136,,
501,0.97,3033.997,3040.137,I hope when it comes time for the final votes Council members will support restoring the other 99%.,136,,
502,0.97,3040.137,3040.437,Thank you.,136,,
503,0.97,3040.437,3116.713,"Thank you so much . were restored that could have an impact on Scaling up health one because the first priority is always going to be staffing ladder companies, staffing the traditional capacity of the fire Department to respond to fires and hire Acutity medical situations.",137,,
504,0.97,3116.713,3122.452,"Unless the needs are met, things like health one will be seen as extra and additional to the mission.",137,,
505,0.97,3122.452,3134.164,So these critical investments are also really important to Scaling up those critical additive first response service that's have been such a big priority for the Council over the summer and fall.,137,,
506,0.97,3134.164,3151.581,And this is a really critical component of that to make sure that we are maintaining our other fire first response capabilities while expanding health one.,137,,
507,0.97,3151.581,3154.518,So very happy to join you and glad you brought this forward.,137,,
508,0.97,3154.518,3155.285,Thank you.,138,,
509,0.97,3155.285,3158.922,I appreciate all of your comments and Sign-Ons.,138,,
510,0.97,3158.922,3159.956,Let's move on.,138,,
511,0.97,3159.956,3166.463,I believe before we can go on to the next item on our agenda we have the Walk-On amendment.,138,,
512,0.97,3166.463,3169.9,Is this an appropriate place for that?,138,,
513,0.97,3169.9,3170.1,Okay.,138,,
514,0.97,3170.1,3170.333,Great.,138,,
515,0.97,3170.333,3187.25,"Colleagues as you noted this morning with your vote to amend the agenda, the Walk-On amendment number 1 from Council member Pedersen is going to be considered at this section of the agenda before we move on.",138,,
516,0.97,3187.25,3189.753,If we could zoom in a little bit.,138,,
517,0.97,3189.753,3195.192,Let me turn it over to central staff.,138,,
518,0.97,3195.192,3197.861,I'm Karina bowl on central staff.,139,,
519,0.97,3197.861,3227.257,This would amend ordinary 12 126008 126008.,139,,
520,0.97,3227.257,3232.862,Which means the executives and manager positions.,139,,
521,0.97,3232.862,3253.617,"Assuming that the Council would pass that amendment to this ordinance this would generate savings of $5 million in the 2021 proposed budget by eliminating adjusted wage increases for employees in the Nonrepresented positions who earn 08% or more of the Seattle median income which is about $82,000.",139,,
522,0.97,3253.617,3269.899,"And then the savings generated by this proposal would be reinvested in programs to save city jobs as Council member Pedersen indicated earlier, increase investments in communities and repair bridges.",139,,
523,0.97,3269.899,3270.2,Thank you.,139,,
524,0.97,3270.2,3272.135,Thank you very much.,140,,
525,0.97,3272.135,3273.903,Council member Pedersen please go ahead.,140,,
526,0.97,3273.903,3275.805,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",141,,
527,0.97,3275.805,3284.28,So I feel like I had a good opportunity at 9:30 this morning to introduce this.,141,,
528,0.97,3284.28,3292.422,Happy to jump into question and answer.,141,,
529,0.97,3292.422,3293.623,Wonderful.,142,,
530,0.97,3293.623,3298.728,"Council member Sawant, please go ahead.",142,,
531,0.97,3298.728,3302.499,If we can make sure--there we go.,143,,
532,0.97,3302.499,3303.366,A little background news.,143,,
533,0.97,3303.366,3304.834,Thank you for waiting.,143,,
534,0.97,3304.834,3305.268,Please go ahead.,143,,
535,0.97,3305.268,3307.103,Thank you.,144,,
536,0.97,3307.103,3315.412,"As I said before, when we were approving the agenda of today's meeting, I oppose this amendment.",144,,
537,0.97,3315.412,3320.417,This does not cut the wages of the highest paid city of Seattle employees.,144,,
538,0.97,3320.417,3324.487,It does not cut the pay of the city of Seattle executives.,144,,
539,0.97,3324.487,3328.458,This targets workers while leaving the boss' pay untouched.,144,,
540,0.97,3328.458,3345.842,"The Mayor's proposed budget freezes the pay of city of Seattle executives but that falls far short of capping executive pay at no marry than $150,000 as my office and the people's budget movement have consistently advocated for years.",144,,
541,0.97,3345.842,3352.482,Though I do believe that freezing the pay of executives is an important step at the very least.,144,,
542,0.97,3352.482,3356.186,This budget amendment would extend that pay freeze to city workers.,144,,
543,0.97,3356.186,3364.894,"Yes, we are in a recession and every time there is a recession under capitalism the question becomes who will pay for that recession?",144,,
544,0.97,3364.894,3365.528,Workers or big business.,144,,
545,0.97,3365.528,3372.135,And every time there is a rescission workers are told it is time for shared sacrifice.,144,,
546,0.97,3372.135,3389.986,Will they pay with pay cuts Furloughs and cut social services or build a movement to tax the super rich and in Seattle's case expand the Amazon tax that we just won to stop all budget cuts.,144,,
547,0.97,3389.986,3395.291,This puts even more of the burden of the recession on regular public sector workers.,144,,
548,0.97,3395.291,3399.429,This is a section of the working class.,144,,
549,0.97,3399.429,3403.4,And I would urge Council members not to cosponsor it.,144,,
550,0.97,3403.4,3404.434,Thank you.,145,,
551,0.97,3404.434,3412.442,Are there other comments or questions or Council member Pedersen do have you anything else.,145,,
552,0.97,3412.442,3419.215,"In the abundance of caution, I want to disclose I'm not sure if you would be covered by this or not.",146,,
553,0.97,3419.215,3426.823,"Just to get it out there, my girlfriend Laura barred an assistant city attorney may or may not be covered by this.",146,,
554,0.97,3426.823,3446.075,"I haven't looked into t I want to disclose that in any event if she--if she is covered or if she does, that doesn't factor into my decision making with regards to this budget item.",146,,
555,0.97,3446.075,3452.315,I wanted to flag that as a potential conflict.,146,,
556,0.97,3452.315,3453.983,Thank you Council member Lewis.,147,,
557,0.97,3453.983,3456.085,I know it is a small city.,147,,
558,0.97,3456.085,3458.288,Even though we have grown by quite a bit.,147,,
559,0.97,3458.288,3461.825,That makes a lot of sense for you to flag it.,147,,
560,0.97,3461.825,3470.467,But I don't see that really raising too much concern today given that it is on the macro level.,147,,
561,0.97,3470.467,3472.402,Appreciate you raising it though.,147,,
562,0.97,3472.402,3475.271,I do have some questions.,147,,
563,0.97,3475.271,3483.746,I asked whether or not Thes employees that are affected by the collective bargaining agreement have been reached out to on this.,147,,
564,0.97,3483.746,3491.721,Can you elaborate any more about whether or not there has been conversations with the folks?,147,,
565,0.97,3491.721,3491.988,Sure.,148,,
566,0.97,3491.988,3506.069,So the city government employees who would be getting this raise next year they're not subjected to collective bargaining.,148,,
567,0.97,3506.069,3506.769,Okay.,149,,
568,0.97,3506.769,3511.174,Thank you for clarification.,149,,
569,0.97,3511.174,3511.708,Any additional questions.,149,,
570,0.97,3511.708,3512.141,Thank you.,150,,
571,0.97,3512.141,3516.379,I don't have any questions.,150,,
572,0.97,3516.379,3520.483,Just a general comment about this particular proposal.,150,,
573,0.97,3520.483,3535.565,I did Express significant concerns about the proposal as originally presented and discussed by Council member Pedersen during issue identification phase of the budget process.,150,,
574,0.97,3535.565,3555.018,I think some of the concerns that I raised particularly as it relates to the sponsor's Intenses have been addressed by removing represented employees from the proposal.,150,,
575,0.97,3555.018,3561.691,I continue to have concerns about the impact on Nonrepresented employees.,150,,
576,0.97,3561.691,3577.774,I appreciate the effort to to address some of the race and social justice issues that I highlighted in my comments previously by looking at those employee who's have 80% or more of the Seattle median income.,150,,
577,0.97,3577.774,3589.519,I think that the reality is that we have to be extraordinarily careful in terms of exactly which employees are being impacted.,150,,
578,0.97,3589.519,3606.436,I think it is easy to think that 80% of Seattle median income is a very large volume of--a large amount of money by which our city employees and their families can sustain themselves.,150,,
579,0.97,3606.436,3608.805,I'm not convinced that is true.,150,,
580,0.97,3608.805,3619.649,I have concern about this proposal and will not be supporting this proposal at this juncture.,150,,
581,0.97,3619.649,3619.949,Thank you.,150,,
582,0.97,3619.949,3621.25,"Thank you, Council President.",151,,
583,0.97,3621.25,3623.453,I don't see any additional hands.,151,,
584,0.97,3623.453,3627.323,Did you have any additional comments on this.,151,,
585,0.97,3627.323,3627.557,No.,152,,
586,0.97,3627.557,3642.505,"I want to thank my colleagues for enabling us to have a gracious discussion about the different consequences, unintended consequences, the choices that we--the tough choice that's we have to make.",152,,
587,0.97,3642.505,3646.242,Other considerations like the one that Council member Sawant raised.,152,,
588,0.97,3646.242,3650.68,I just want to thank my colleagues for their grace in letting us discuss this today.,152,,
589,0.97,3650.68,3656.586,"And, you know, again, we're not technically voting on it today.",152,,
590,0.97,3656.586,3676.739,"But when the renewed revenue forecast comes out, if there is any other sort of thing that happens that could impact our budget, I was able to vote in favor of the first amendment today to restore those jobs you know because this is about preventing layoffs of city government employees as well, in my mind at least.",152,,
591,0.97,3676.739,3682.045,I'm not sure where we're going to find the funding to do all of the things that we want to do.,152,,
592,0.97,3682.045,3691.954,I appreciate my colleagues enabling me to air this as one potential source if it were to become necessary.,152,,
593,0.97,3691.954,3692.255,Thank you.,152,,
594,0.97,3692.255,3694.057,Thank you very much Council member Pedersen.,153,,
595,0.97,3694.057,3698.061,Let's move on to the next section here.,153,,
596,0.97,3698.061,3700.196,"Thank you, Karina.",153,,
597,0.97,3700.196,3700.63,"Good morning, Tom.",153,,

599,0.97,3705.068,3707.27,I'm with your Council central staff.,154,,
600,0.97,3707.27,3713.643,We're talking now about the Finance general section of the budget.,154,,
601,0.97,3713.643,3726.255,"Budget action Fg1A1 would add $150,000 to finance general reserves for the partial year costs of establishing an economic forecasting office that would be developed through separate legislation.",154,,
602,0.97,3726.255,3736.799,This funding would be combined with existing amounts in the city budget office budget to support the initial setup and partial year costs of the independent office.,154,,
603,0.97,3736.799,3760.189,"Similar to the King County office of economic and financial research and the Washington state economic revenue forecast Council staff, an independent office would enable access to independent and confidential economic and tax research and resources for both the Council and Mayor and would establish a level playing field for the timing of receiving this type of information.",154,,
604,0.97,3760.189,3763.392,Legislation established in the office will be introduced separately.,154,,
605,0.97,3763.392,3774.203,The new office's final operating budget including staff and other considerations will be based on the body of work included in that legislation.,154,,
606,0.97,3774.203,3788.851,"Two Provisos would be released when an ordinance is released for the forecasting office, including $330,000 in the city budget office and $150,000 in the Finance general budget as added by this action.",154,,
607,0.97,3788.851,3801.33,Council President Gonzalez is the prime sponsor with additional sponsors of Council member morals and Lewis.,154,,
608,0.97,3801.33,3804.0,"Council President, thank you so much.",154,,
609,0.97,3804.0,3804.4,Please go ahead.,154,,
610,0.97,3804.4,3809.572,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda and Tom thank you for that.",155,,
611,0.97,3809.572,3813.709,I may need to Toggle back and forth.,155,,
612,0.97,3813.709,3821.851,I'm representing the city of Seattle at the assembly meeting and we're getting close to doing a roll call on the other side.,155,,
613,0.97,3821.851,3828.191,I apologize if I have to interrupt my comments to go Toggle to the other screen here.,155,,
614,0.97,3828.191,3838.434,"Quickly, I believe that city council members and its staff should have equal access to the economic provided to the executive branch.",155,,
615,0.97,3838.434,3854.083,Of course we all know that the city budget office directly reports to the Mayor's office and that embedded within the Mayor's city budget office is the economic revenue forecast unit.,155,,
616,0.97,3854.083,3862.525,Since the forecast generated within the city's budget office--sorry pardon me just a moment.,155,,
617,0.97,3865.261,3866.629,No problem.,156,,
618,0.97,3866.629,3869.265,Sorry about that.,157,,
619,0.97,3878.875,3879.242,Thank you.,158,,
620,0.97,3879.242,3881.11,Thank you for representing us.,159,,
621,0.97,3881.11,3881.41,Thanks.,160,,
622,0.97,3881.41,3884.447,Sorry--thank you for the indulgence.,160,,
623,0.97,3884.447,3894.69,"Within the Mayor city budget office, executive staff has sole responsibility for the data, methodology and initial conclusions part of the forecasting process.",160,,
624,0.97,3894.69,3908.571,Both before and after forecasts are completed central staff analysts would benefit from unfettered access to the underlying assumptions data and other information with the forecasting process and results.,160,,
625,0.97,3908.571,3919.982,Other levels of government including King County and Washington state have independent forecasting units that report jointly to the legislative and executive branches at the identical time.,160,,
626,0.97,3919.982,3929.258,My office and central staff have met with King County staff responsible for their 2008 charter.,160,,
627,0.97,3929.258,3948.144,"They confirmed that the utilization of this model has multiple Upsides including increased public transparency, confidence, more robust forecasts and improved collaboration and trust between the executive trust and efficacy between--between the executive and the Council.",160,,
628,0.97,3948.144,3957.52,I believe this is an effective good government structure which the city of Seattle should emulate.,160,,
629,0.97,3957.52,3968.331,I think this is well worth the cost of implementation and it should provide many broad benefits to the budgeting exercises for many years to come.,160,,
630,0.97,3968.331,3969.832,Thank you Madam chair.,160,,
631,0.97,3969.832,3971.467,Happy to answer any questions.,160,,
632,0.97,3971.467,3974.036,"Thank you, Council President.",161,,
633,0.97,3974.036,3994.423,Are there any additional questions?,161,,
634,0.97,3999.628,4013.209,Item number 3 is Council budget action which adds $30 million of the general fund to finance general reserves for strategic fund to address displacement.,161,,
635,0.97,4013.209,4027.223,Areas at high risk of displacement or in areas of low access to opportunity that present unique opportunities for Transformal economic development.,161,,
636,0.97,4031.494,4038.0,However that is proposed to be cut in the third quarter supplemental bill proposed by the executive.,161,,
637,0.97,4038.0,4046.075,This action would Reappropriate that same amount into the 2021 budget.,161,,
638,0.97,4046.075,4062.958,It indicated that none of the amount that Aappropriate rated for that purpose may be spent until authorized by future ordinance and the Council would anticipate the authority won be granted until the executive submits a proposed spending plan for the moneys.,161,,
639,0.97,4062.958,4071.634,"This action is sponsored by Council member Sawant with additional response sores of Herbold, council member Morales.",161,,
640,0.97,4071.634,4071.967,Excellent.,162,,
641,0.97,4071.967,4072.635,Thank you.,162,,
642,0.97,4072.635,4074.603,"Council member Sawant, please go ahead.",162,,
643,0.97,4074.603,4075.137,Thank you.,163,,
644,0.97,4075.137,4084.647,And thank you to Council members Herbold and Morales for supporting this budget amendment.,163,,
645,0.97,4084.647,4092.455,The Mayor describes this as a cut to the investment fund in the 3RD quarter supplemental budget.,163,,
646,0.97,4092.455,4098.761,But that language is intentionally designed to mean absolutely nothing and to hide what is really being cut.,163,,
647,0.97,4098.761,4115.644,This is very different from the language that Mayor Durkan used in last year's budget when she trumpeted she was creating this Fund and would work with community organizations to invest these $30 million to address displacement in black and Brown communities.,163,,
648,0.97,4115.644,4123.686,"As I pointed out last week, the Mayor talked about this $30 million exactly the same way that she is now talking about the $100 million.",163,,
649,0.97,4123.686,4129.625,But she has neglected to invest one pen Eve the $30 million in real time.,163,,
650,0.97,4129.625,4135.297,So it has cast a shadow on what will happen with the $100 million as well.,163,,
651,0.97,4135.297,4139.902,Many Council members have expressed outrage that the Mayor was breaking this promise.,163,,
652,0.97,4139.902,4152.148,I hope that Council members will support and cosponsor this amendment to follow through in practice to the Player's cut that has been correctly expressed in words last year.,163,,
653,0.97,4152.148,4156.218,There is no shortage of essential projects that the funds could be used for.,163,,
654,0.97,4156.218,4159.288,Unfortunately we are in a situation where we are spoiled for choices.,163,,
655,0.97,4159.288,4177.773,"They could be used inform build affordable houses for child care, for community centers in places like the central district where huge groups of Seattleites have been displaced by rising housing costs.",163,,
656,0.97,4177.773,4185.614,The funds would be perfect for the Antidisplacement project.,163,,
657,0.97,4185.614,4189.251,That is one example that we have already discussed yesterday.,163,,
658,0.97,4189.251,4197.993,And thank you to Council member Morales for being the only Council member willing to support the proposal.,163,,
659,0.97,4197.993,4199.461,I hope others will soon.,163,,
660,0.97,4199.461,4214.276,There are countless other uses that will greatly benefit the working class community and marginalized communities which making sure that these funds are actually used for the intended purpose.,163,,
661,0.97,4214.276,4223.018,And cutting these funds is simply unacceptable.,163,,
662,0.97,4223.018,4227.723,Several good options how they could be funded.,163,,
663,0.97,4227.723,4230.392,It could be funded by increasing the Amazon tax rate.,163,,
664,0.97,4230.392,4237.499,"It could be funded by Defunding the police by 50%, which would free up an additional 170 million.",163,,
665,0.97,4237.499,4243.973,Or it could be funded in other ways that are being discussed last week.,163,,
666,0.97,4243.973,4256.485,"If Council member support during this funding which would be consistent with the statement, my office would be flexible about the funding sources as long as it is Progressive.",163,,
667,0.97,4256.485,4258.287,Thank you very much Council member Sawant.,164,,
668,0.97,4258.287,4259.989,Are there any questions or comments.,164,,
669,0.97,4259.989,4266.028,I have a quick question and perhaps this is for Tom.,165,,
670,0.97,4266.028,4272.635,I think it is summarized nicely in the document that you provided in Sawant's summary as well.,165,,
671,0.97,4272.635,4289.585,"Want to reiterate, this puts back into place the exact same language that was used during the conversations initially in 2019 that really put side boards around how the 30 million was to be used.",165,,
672,0.97,4289.585,4292.154,Is this the exact same language.,165,,
673,0.97,4292.154,4295.257,"Yes, chair Mosqueda.",166,,
674,0.97,4295.257,4302.631,This is essentially reimposing--replacing what was in the 2020 budget and adopting the same language.,166,,
675,0.97,4302.631,4304.8,Thank you very much.,167,,
676,0.97,4304.8,4314.376,"As Council member Sawant noted, I think there were a lot people who had worked on that language and it is important for them to hear that.",167,,
677,0.97,4314.376,4318.414,"Council member Herbold, please go ahead.",167,,
678,0.97,4318.414,4318.981,Thank you.,168,,
679,0.97,4318.981,4332.594,I want to share with the viewing public a press release that we received from Puget sound Sage.,168,,
680,0.97,4332.594,4343.605,Share the city Graham Street community members around this proposal in the Mayor's budget to reduce these funds.,168,,
681,0.97,4343.605,4372.668,"They remind us--this is a bit of history to the original allocation of these funds--they remind us when this huge parcel of land was being sold in 2019, we heard from a lot of people concerned that we were selling public land.",168,,
682,0.97,4372.668,4397.326,"And I quote, the press release says, when the Mayor and Council ultimately decided to sell the Mercer mega block to the developer, Alexandria real estate equities for $143 million, community opposition was somewhat softened by the way that the city proposed to allocate proceeds from the sale.",168,,
683,0.97,4397.326,4405.3,"In particular, $78.2 million was earmarked for affordable housing, including 30 million for the strategic investment fund.",168,,
684,0.97,4405.3,4421.75,The loss of public land city leaders promised would enable the acquisition of land for new affordable housing and community development projects elsewhere in the city to be used to combat displacement and Regent Reification.,168,,
685,0.97,4421.75,4435.03,"The Mayor says about the sale, I believe years from now people will look back at the chance and say we seized an incredible opportunity to make our city better by reinvesting the proceeds directly in housing across Seattle.",168,,
686,0.97,4435.03,4445.641,So I think it is really important that we maintain our communities to community as it relates to this funding.,168,,
687,0.97,4445.641,4458.086,Not just because of the context in which those commitments were made but because of the great need.,168,,
688,0.97,4458.086,4496.325,"Finally because there are communities who are right now engaged in discussions about priorities Informer this funding, I don't think it is appropriate to again ask those same communities to shift their efforts from figuring out how--what the priorities are for spending this funding for affordable housing needs and instead use the same dollars and engage in a process around the Mayor's task force.",168,,
689,0.97,4496.325,4509.671,It just feels really unfair to a community who has been mobilizing for these funds and working to plan to spend them now.,168,,
690,0.97,4509.671,4510.005,Thank you.,169,,
691,0.97,4510.005,4512.875,Thank you very much Council member Herbold.,170,,
692,0.97,4512.875,4513.509,Any additional comments.,170,,

694,0.97,4514.743,4515.377,Please go ahead.,171,,
695,0.97,4515.377,4521.383,I want to thank Council member Herbold because I had that same press release pulled up.,172,,
696,0.97,4521.383,4523.085,Thank you for reading it for me.,172,,
697,0.97,4523.085,4524.92,I want to echo the sentiment.,172,,
698,0.97,4524.92,4531.093,We have community members who are as we speak in the process of making plans for that commitment that was made to them.,172,,
699,0.97,4531.093,4566.528,So I do think it is really important that we honor those commitments and that we don't ask folks to prepare themselves for some process of application and really acknowledge this is an important important resource that has been committed and we need to make sure that the projects can continue and don't get disrupted by having to pause and wait for the next round of opportunity to come up.,172,,
700,0.97,4566.528,4566.795,Okay.,173,,
701,0.97,4566.795,4567.563,Thank you all very much.,173,,

730,0.97,4675.537,4685.38,As I mentioned this item is sponsored by Council member Herbold as primary sponsor and morals and Strauss.,178,,
731,0.97,4685.38,4690.652,This would add ongoing general fund dollars to Hsd for age friendly Seattle.,178,,
732,0.97,4690.652,4698.66,"This action will restore the program's budget to $603,000 and avoid reductions in 2021.",178,,
733,0.97,4698.66,4706.334,With that I will turn it over to Council member Herbold to discuss further.,178,,

739,0.97,4754.015,4759.321,The cut in the 2020 budget the proposed cut is about 10%.,179,,
740,0.97,4759.321,4780.342,"By reversing that cut, we can restore programming that would otherwise be postponed such as the creation of memory loss training for--for staff working with older adults and the launch of the age friendly business initiative.",179,,
741,0.97,4780.342,4790.852,"The reduction would also impact printing outreach materials, translation and interpretation for virtual and In-Person events.",179,,

754,0.97,4822.551,4831.259,"So to summarize, council member Herbold is joined by Council member Morales, Sawant, Juarez, Strauss and Lewis.",184,,
755,0.97,4831.259,4831.56,Excellent.,184,,
756,0.97,4831.56,4834.629,Thank you very much.,184,,
757,0.97,4834.629,4837.432,Let's move on.,184,,
758,0.97,4837.432,4839.1,Agenda number 5.,185,,
759,0.97,4839.1,4846.641,Sponsored by Council member Sawant as the primary sponsor as well as Council member Juarez and Council President Gonzalez.,185,,
760,0.97,4846.641,4856.218,This is a statement of legislative intent that would request that Hsd carry forward unspent funding for senior congregate meal programs to 2021.,185,,
761,0.97,4856.218,4869.764,As you're aware at the end of the year the city budget office works with departments to identify any Underspent and determine what should be carried forward into the next year's budget through the carry forward ordinance which is passed by Council.,185,,
762,0.97,4869.764,4884.179,This budget action would request that any unused funds for senior congregate meal programs unable to be used in 2020 due to social distancing requirements be carried forward and added to any 2021 funding for that purpose.,185,,
763,0.97,4884.179,4892.754,I will now turn it over to Council member Sawant to discuss further.,185,,
764,0.97,4892.754,4894.055,Thank you.,186,,
765,0.97,4894.055,4896.091,Thank you.,187,,
766,0.97,4896.091,4910.872,This proposal would authorize human services Department to extend contracts with organizations such as Asian counseling and referral services for congregate meals and community activities from 2020 into 2021.,187,,
767,0.97,4910.872,4915.31,Acts as fiscal sponsor for nine senior programs.,187,,
768,0.97,4915.31,4929.291,"The Vietnamese senior Association, Mong senior Association.",187,,
769,0.97,4929.291,4929.724,Elder Association.,187,,
770,0.97,4929.724,4931.993,Korean senior Club and Club bamboo.,187,,
771,0.97,4931.993,4944.739,"In 2020 human services provided $126,227 to Asrs to support congregate meals for the seniors helped by these programs.",187,,
772,0.97,4944.739,4958.753,"However due to the social distancing required by Covid many of those funds could not be used for their intended purpose and human services said if the funds are not used by the end of the year, they will no longer be available.",187,,
773,0.97,4958.753,4961.256,So we think this is an important amendment.,187,,
774,0.97,4961.256,4972.033,"I've had the honor of attending events organized by the Vietnamese organization, one of the 19 organizations funded by Acrs.",187,,
775,0.97,4972.033,4976.271,It is an incredibly important service to stay connected to their communities.,187,,
776,0.97,4976.271,4984.245,In addition to vital access to meals and also culturally appropriate activities.,187,,
777,0.97,4984.245,4990.318,They are Lookingforward to restarting congregate meals and activities when it is safe to do so.,187,,
778,0.97,4990.318,4999.427,"They hope at some point in 2021, it will become possible.",187,,
779,0.97,4999.427,5004.833,The department essentially have informed them that is not possible without a budget amendment.,187,,
780,0.97,5004.833,5015.076,And the format of their contract is authorized Acrs to fund these activities and Acrs is reimbursed for those expenses.,187,,
781,0.97,5015.076,5022.817,If it does not use the funds by the end of the year they are not eligible for reimbursement without this budget amendment.,187,,
782,0.97,5022.817,5029.424,They would rather wait to use the funds when it is safe to do so and I think that is completely reasonable and correct of them.,187,,
783,0.97,5029.424,5031.259,So I hope that Council will support that.,187,,
784,0.97,5031.259,5035.93,I think that is the correct thick to do.,187,,
785,0.97,5035.93,5041.436,This would allow Acrs to use the 2020 funds in 2021.,187,,
786,0.97,5041.436,5043.304,Thank you Council Sawant.,188,,
787,0.97,5043.304,5049.11,Are there questions on this item?,188,,

793,0.97,5059.154,5064.592,I'm going to summarize those and I want to thank you for bringing those forward.,188,,

799,0.97,5087.048,5093.688,"This would add $85,000 ongoing general fund to Hsd for statewide lobbying focusing on poverty alleviation.",189,,
800,0.97,5093.688,5102.764,"The contract was funded with $85,000 in 2020 and it reduces funding to $25,475.",189,,
801,0.97,5102.764,5113.541,"This action would increase the contract to a total of $110,000.",189,,
802,0.97,5113.541,5113.842,I'm sorry.,189,,
803,0.97,5113.842,5114.342,"110, $475 in 2021.",189,,
804,0.97,5114.342,5129.023,I will turn it over to Council member Morales now.,189,,

807,0.97,5133.361,5139.134,So this is as we discussed last week a lobbying contract.,190,,
808,0.97,5139.134,5150.545,"This would restore funding for a really important ongoing contract that has made a huge impact for Seattle, across Washington state.",190,,
809,0.97,5150.545,5157.085,"And would bring the contract up to $110,000 which reflects the traditional level of increase.",190,,
810,0.97,5157.085,5175.67,"And just as a reminder over the last few years, this funding has helped the city to advocate at the state level for expanding housing services for people with disabilities, for making it easier for folk who's were previously incarcerated to reenter their communities.",190,,
811,0.97,5175.67,5180.408,So there's a lot of really important state level work that has to happen.,190,,
812,0.97,5180.408,5188.483,And so we really rely on these folks to help with our local needs at the state level.,190,,
813,0.97,5188.483,5197.091,So I am hoping to have support so that we can continue this work.,190,,
814,0.97,5197.091,5198.86,The legislator is going to be in session soon.,190,,
815,0.97,5198.86,5205.433,And we have to make sure that we have folks advocating for the most vulnerable in our community.,190,,

834,0.97,5289.784,5291.819,It would hire a security guard.,194,,

839,0.97,5306.167,5331.059,I brought this forward in collaboration with some of my colleagues to really make sure that we are able to give Hsd the resources to adequately increase our investment in an incredibly Underserved community in the city of Seattle.,195,,
840,0.97,5331.059,5337.332,I think this is a pretty modest budget add relative to the impact that it could have.,195,,
841,0.97,5337.332,5360.621,And I really want to make sure that even as we're making tough decisions we're still--we're still able to move forward in this budget on increasing our investments to truly provide justice and service and dignity to all of the people in the city.,195,,
842,0.97,5360.621,5368.93,I think that is what this goes to I don't have much in addition to add.,195,,
843,0.97,5368.93,5374.035,We've discussed a lot about the adds over the last couple of days.,195,,
844,0.97,5374.035,5379.14,There is overlap with the adds that Council member Juarez and I put forward.,195,,
845,0.97,5379.14,5390.051,"But with that, I think I will just leave that as my comments for now.",195,,
846,0.97,5390.051,5392.653,Thank you.,196,,
847,0.97,5392.653,5406.033,Any additional questions or comments.,196,,
848,0.97,5406.033,5409.07,Thank you for those comments.,197,,
849,0.97,5409.07,5410.438,"Council member Juarez, the next one is yours.",197,,
850,0.97,5410.438,5418.212,I will turn it back over to Amy.,197,,
851,0.97,5418.212,5423.451,Hsd5A1.,198,,
852,0.97,5423.451,5438.065,"This item would add $33,000 one time general fund to Hsd and $67,000 one time general fund to the Department of education and early learning for program supporting native and indigenous children and families.",198,,
853,0.97,5438.065,5448.309,The funding at Hsd would fund foster care support programs and the funding would support the preschool program at daybreak Star preschool in 2021.,198,,
854,0.97,5448.309,5451.078,It does not--but doesn't continue on to 2022.,198,,
855,0.97,5451.078,5458.519,I will now turn it over to Council member Juarez for more information.,198,,
856,0.97,5458.519,5459.787,Thank you.,199,,
857,0.97,5459.787,5461.522,"Thank you, Amy.",199,,
858,0.97,5461.522,5478.739,"Thank you, Madam chair and thank you coups member Lewis for your support and Pedersen and all that supported item number 7. I'm going to--I have some prepared notes but I'm going to go off script a little more to give more context to the United Indians.",199,,
859,0.97,5478.739,5487.014,It is a social service provider and cultural home for urban Indians since 1970.,199,,
860,0.97,5487.014,5490.351,But they operate many social service programs.,199,,
861,0.97,5490.351,5501.429,Today's agenda and budget request we will be discussing their request for Pre-K money and their Indian welfare program.,199,,
862,0.97,5501.429,5509.604,"Starting with the United Indians has requested $100,000 from our budget process to support their efforts to continue providing services during the pandemic.",199,,
863,0.97,5509.604,5518.98,"In regards to the Prek program, thank you to Gonzalez for directing us to deals for those funds.",199,,
864,0.97,5518.98,5523.351,"67,000 would go towards supporting the daybreak Star preschool program through deal.",199,,
865,0.97,5523.351,5534.061,"During the pandemic, families are experiencing greater unemployment, battling food insecurity and struggling with remote learning.",199,,
866,0.97,5534.061,5537.331,Current state subsidies don't adequately fund program needs.,199,,
867,0.97,5537.331,5546.34,That's why I'm here today in support of United Indians.,199,,
868,0.97,5546.34,5551.112,Only early learning program in the city of Seattle.,199,,
869,0.97,5551.112,5556.684,The preschool program pro advised activities and nutrition meals.,199,,
870,0.97,5556.684,5562.757,Families depend to identify cultural identities to become kindergarten ready.,199,,
871,0.97,5562.757,5566.761,These families cannot afford the cost of private child care.,199,,
872,0.97,5566.761,5577.872,Adding a third classroom just to respond to the need for a remote learning space for children with opportunities for outdoor play while families are at work.,199,,
873,0.97,5577.872,5591.285,They have designated this additional classroom for child care focus for ages 5-7. the second piece of this is a little more complex.,199,,
874,0.97,5591.285,5597.858,If you could indulge me involving the child welfare program.,199,,
875,0.97,5597.858,5603.331,"The remaining request of $33,000 would go through Hsd.",199,,
876,0.97,5603.331,5613.14,Indian child welfare program they will be providing additional incentives to encourage families to become licensed and support the children placed with them.,199,,
877,0.97,5613.14,5617.044,"Now, I just want to give a little bit of background here.",199,,
878,0.97,5617.044,5625.152,I don't--we don't actually spend a lot of time talking about--I think people culturally know what they do.,199,,
879,0.97,5625.152,5635.096,Dr. Mike tulle who is the Ceo who I have known for years and of course I have been involved with United Indians since the day we took it over.,199,,
880,0.97,5635.096,5635.963,I've been their lawyer.,199,,
881,0.97,5635.963,5637.098,I've been on their board.,199,,
882,0.97,5637.098,5637.631,I've been involved.,199,,
883,0.97,5637.631,5645.373,So I want to give a little context here about the Indian child care welfare program.,199,,
884,0.97,5645.373,5651.345,"It is important particularly in light of the fact that they're only asking for $100,000.",199,,
885,0.97,5651.345,5654.649,The Indian child welfare act was passed in 1978.,199,,
886,0.97,5654.649,5662.857,"It was enacted in response to a crisis affecting native children, Alaska that I Tiffs, families and tribes.",199,,
887,0.97,5662.857,5675.469,Studies revealed that large numbers of native children were being separated from their parents extended families and communities by private adoption agencies.,199,,
888,0.97,5675.469,5697.058,"In fact research showed that 25 to 30% of all children that were being removed, that 85% of these children that were taken outside of their families and communities, that there were willing and fit relatives available.",199,,
889,0.97,5697.058,5707.068,"United Indians with this money does the outreach, contacting the tribes, does the training so children are placed welling relatives and extended family.",199,,
890,0.97,5707.068,5718.846,So the reason why this is important because it is a federal law and state law and you have organizations like United Indians and the board that often implement Federal and state law through state and city money.,199,,
891,0.97,5718.846,5730.191,"So when you go back and you look at this Act, congressional testimony documented the devastating impact that it was having upon indigenous children families and tribes.",199,,
892,0.97,5730.191,5731.092,That continues today.,199,,
893,0.97,5731.092,5742.87,The intent of Congress was to protect the best interest of Indian children.,199,,
894,0.97,5742.87,5745.406,This is why I say that.,199,,
895,0.97,5745.406,5755.683,Because United Indians again is promoting and implementing the values and the intent of this Federal law through state law on the ground to address removal practices.,199,,
896,0.97,5755.683,5758.052,To ensure the protections.,199,,
897,0.97,5758.052,5759.92,To assist families.,199,,
898,0.97,5759.92,5760.688,To train families.,199,,
899,0.97,5760.688,5761.956,To do outreach.,199,,
900,0.97,5761.956,5767.828,To identify potential homes and licensing and training which is no easy feat.,199,,
901,0.97,5767.828,5769.663,Trust me it is difficult to work with the state.,199,,
902,0.97,5769.663,5773.467,You get money in the door.,199,,
903,0.97,5773.467,5788.015,You get families lined up to contact tribes to place these children in Native-Americans homes and work with the tribes to find willing extended family members.,199,,
904,0.97,5788.015,5791.685,"So when you put into context, $33,000 is not a lot of money.",199,,
905,0.97,5791.685,5795.956,Boss it is funds to make sure that they are placed with native families.,199,,
906,0.97,5795.956,5800.528,That we do the outreach and recognize and honor the indigenous people.,199,,
907,0.97,5800.528,5803.697,The first indigenous people of this land.,199,,
908,0.97,5803.697,5804.064,So thank you.,199,,
909,0.97,5804.064,5806.433,Thank you very much Council member Juarez.,200,,
910,0.97,5806.433,5809.937,Are there additional comments or questions?,200,,
911,0.97,5809.937,5817.211,"Council member Juarez, I'm not seeing any comments or questions but I'm seeing a lot of hands raised to be add today your list here.",200,,
912,0.97,5817.211,5837.798,"In addition to Council member Juarez as the prime sponsor, we see that there are even more hands raising now.",200,,
913,0.97,5837.798,5847.341,Before we get going . Rded I'm going to wait one second because you are all amazing and everybody is working hard to get signed on here.,200,,
914,0.97,5847.341,5847.608,Okay.,200,,
915,0.97,5847.608,5848.809,I think we've got everyone.,200,,
916,0.97,5848.809,5853.981,We have Council member Lewis and Council President Gonzalez.,200,,
917,0.97,5853.981,5859.32,"Also Council member Strauss, Pedersen, Sawant, Morales and Herbold.",200,,
918,0.97,5859.32,5860.354,Thank you very much all.,200,,
919,0.97,5860.354,5866.093,And we will move on to the next item.,200,,
920,0.97,5866.093,5867.828,Thank you Council President.,200,,
921,0.97,5867.828,5869.263,I mean Council member Juarez.,200,,
922,0.97,5869.263,5881.909,"Item number is Hsd6A1 and sponsored by Council member Herbold as primary sponsor as well as Council members Strauss and Lewis and Morales, I believe.",201,,
923,0.97,5881.909,5890.951,This item is a statement of legislative intent that would request that Hsd provide a report on the demand and cost for city wide diversion programs.,201,,
924,0.97,5890.951,5896.924,This report would be due to the public safety and human services equipment by August 2ND of 2021.,201,,
925,0.97,5896.924,5900.094,I will now turn it over to Council member Herbold.,201,,
926,0.97,5900.094,5902.563,Thank you.,202,,
927,0.97,5902.563,5911.672,"So just as a bit of background, you may recall that the council passed resolution 31916 a year ago.",202,,
928,0.97,5911.672,5914.975,Not quite but almost in November 2019.,202,,
929,0.97,5914.975,5925.252,This resolution acknowledges the city's inherent responsibility to reduce unnecessary justice system involvement.,202,,
930,0.97,5925.252,5935.229,Acknowledges that Prearrest diversion programs such as lead represent a harm reduction evidence approach to provide for the public safety.,202,,
931,0.97,5935.229,5950.077,"Again, Prearrest diversion programs in the--in the public safety investment planning model that they provided last week is an intercept zero type of a program.",202,,
932,0.97,5950.077,5958.953,Meaning the investment in the intervention occurs before the--before the interaction with law enforcement.,202,,
933,0.97,5958.953,5974.068,The Council also declared our intent and our commitment to ensuring that these programs receive public funding sufficient to accept all priority qualifying referrals city wide.,202,,
934,0.97,5974.068,5999.927,"Again, one of the elements that is unique about the city's Prearrest diversion program is its ability to take calls directly from community members and receive referrals from folks who are representatives of our business community.",202,,
935,0.97,5999.927,6001.161,Advocates for open space.,202,,
936,0.97,6001.161,6009.269,Representatives of people who are concerned about the contamination of our water ways.,202,,
937,0.97,6009.269,6014.942,It allows lead to interact with folks who in some cases might be homeless.,202,,
938,0.97,6014.942,6018.312,In other cases are likely to be criminal justice involved.,202,,
939,0.97,6018.312,6024.985,But to take those referrals directly from community members.,202,,
940,0.97,6024.985,6031.458,Thus not relying on the 911 crisis response system.,202,,
941,0.97,6031.458,6035.896,The city intends that the lead program operate at scale by 2023.,202,,
942,0.97,6035.896,6045.472,"Again, this is something expressed in our--in our resolution passed last year.",202,,
943,0.97,6045.472,6056.417,At scale by 2023 means that the program will have the appropriate funding to accept all priority qualifying arrests and social contact referrals city wide.,202,,
944,0.97,6056.417,6074.401,The slide ensures that budget decisions are guided by well supported projections as Council works to take lead to scale over the next several years with report on projects of referral and funding due in early August.,202,,
945,0.97,6074.401,6088.582,Lead has built and activated community referral channels where they can directly request response but do not need to be responded through a law enforcement lens.,202,,
946,0.97,6088.582,6097.558,"Many, many people in Seattle support alternative responses to public order of crime that's are related to behavioral health and extreme poverty.",202,,
947,0.97,6097.558,6103.831,There is no increase in the lead budget in--proposed for 2020.,202,,
948,0.97,6103.831,6106.066,I am not proposing an increase.,202,,
949,0.97,6106.066,6138.732,But I do think that we need to be intentionally engaged as we are Reimagining our public safety response system for the--for the city that we are Intentfully engaged in planning efforts to increase funding for this part of what is now the lead program is now part of our public safety system.,202,,
950,0.97,6138.732,6139.032,Thank you.,202,,
951,0.97,6139.032,6142.402,Are there any additional questions?,202,,
952,0.97,6142.402,6142.603,Okay.,202,,
953,0.97,6142.603,6144.538,"Council member Herbold, I don't see any additional questions.",202,,
954,0.97,6144.538,6154.181,I do see a handful of folks who are adding additional support.,202,,
955,0.97,6161.355,6165.626,"Let's move on to the next one, colleagues.",202,,
956,0.97,6165.626,6171.031,Next budget item is item 10 on the agenda.,203,,
957,0.97,6171.031,6171.632,It is Hsd7A1.,203,,
958,0.97,6171.632,6177.838,Council member Juarez is the primary sponsor with Pedersen and Strauss also sponsoring.,203,,
959,0.97,6177.838,6189.85,"This item would add $80,000 in one time funding to the 2021 budget to fund commercial exploitation services at an organization such as Ora Commons.",203,,
960,0.97,6189.85,6193.086,This would replace one-time funding included in the 2020 budget.,203,,
961,0.97,6193.086,6198.926,I will now turn it over to Council member Juarez.,203,,
962,0.97,6198.926,6201.528,Thank you.,204,,
963,0.97,6201.528,6202.729,Thank you.,205,,
964,0.97,6202.729,6202.963,Sorry.,205,,
965,0.97,6202.963,6212.272,I was trying to race back to my desk before me tea pot went off.,205,,
966,0.97,6212.272,6212.639,Aurora Commons.,205,,
967,0.97,6212.639,6217.477,I'm a big Cheerleader for Aurora Commons.,205,,
968,0.97,6217.477,6222.082,As you know Aurora Commons was founded in 2011.,205,,
969,0.97,6222.082,6231.592,And it provides specialized services every day to help women in the sex trade industry who are exploited or victims of human trafficking.,205,,
970,0.97,6231.592,6235.229,Over 500 women a year access their drop in services.,205,,
971,0.97,6235.229,6238.665,More than any other of their partner organizations combined.,205,,
972,0.97,6238.665,6248.208,Most of the clients which includes both men and women are experiencing homelessness and many are facing addiction and mental illness as well.,205,,
973,0.97,6248.208,6254.281,Clients are frequently filing domestic violence and/or recovering from sexual assault.,205,,
974,0.97,6254.281,6262.222,Other key partners are Harvard view hospital Madison clinic and neighbor care and Seattle King County.,205,,
975,0.97,6262.222,6270.03,"Seattle has invested $80,000 in Aurora Commons every year since 2017.",205,,
976,0.97,6270.03,6272.833,This request is for continuing funded.,205,,
977,0.97,6272.833,6276.47,We have so many success stories when we go to the dinner every year.,205,,
978,0.97,6276.47,6286.246,"And so many women who have used the services, have gotten into treatment and gotten jobs to the point that Aurora Commons has even hired some of their former clients.",205,,
979,0.97,6286.246,6291.518,Needles to say these are critical services given the increasing number of people who are homeless.,205,,
980,0.97,6291.518,6299.793,The severity of the conditions and the impact of the pandemic on this population which we are seeing more and more along the Aurora corridor.,205,,
981,0.97,6299.793,6306.4,So I'm hoping we will continue to support the Aurora Commons since they have become the success story that they are.,205,,
982,0.97,6306.4,6306.8,Thank you.,205,,
983,0.97,6306.8,6307.834,Thank you.,206,,
984,0.97,6307.834,6316.543,Are there any additional questions?,206,,
985,0.97,6316.543,6320.247,"Council member water he is, just a quick question from me.",206,,
986,0.97,6320.247,6325.852,I know that the Aurora Commons was discussed yesterday as well.,206,,
987,0.97,6325.852,6329.256,That was more related to the capital efforts.,206,,
988,0.97,6329.256,6329.523,Yeah.,207,,
989,0.97,6329.523,6338.598,I think we were asking for the 1.6 to help purchase the $3.5 million building for the capital side.,207,,
990,0.97,6338.598,6346.306,"This has been an ongoing--they have always only asked for $80,000 since 2017.",207,,
991,0.97,6346.306,6349.042,They have never asked for more.,207,,
992,0.97,6349.042,6350.677,They're two separate one.,207,,
993,0.97,6350.677,6356.483,"You see the 1.6 on the capital side and the continued $80,000 on the programming side.",207,,
994,0.97,6356.483,6361.321,No increase to continue the services that they have been doing.,207,,
995,0.97,6361.321,6363.49,Got it thank you very much.,208,,
996,0.97,6363.49,6364.758,Thank you.,209,,
997,0.97,6364.758,6373.333,And I assume they're on a calendar year budget overall so this is the potentially facing this program going away in January.,209,,
998,0.97,6373.333,6373.7,Absolutely.,210,,
999,0.97,6373.7,6375.469,And that's what my big concern is.,210,,
1000,0.97,6375.469,6378.271,"Again, you know we have this momentum.",210,,
1001,0.97,6378.271,6383.877,And if we are being--I'm just going to say this because I think--for me to say this.,210,,
1002,0.97,6383.877,6394.354,I know what kind of definite deficit we're facing.,210,,
1003,0.97,6394.354,6398.325,"You shared Madam chair over 150,000.",210,,
1004,0.97,6398.325,6399.626,I would love to pop sore everything.,210,,
1005,0.97,6399.626,6408.068,What we have and what our office is trying to do and what I try to do is be strategic about what are we focusing on?,210,,
1006,0.97,6408.068,6413.273,"And what we have been focusing on is the homelessness issue, public safety and social services.",210,,
1007,0.97,6413.273,6419.479,What is the best use of those funds that go directly towards that?,210,,
1008,0.97,6419.479,6427.053,And that is where I have been placing not only what I am promoting but what I'm sponsoring and what I am supporting.,210,,
1009,0.97,6427.053,6435.996,"It doesn't mean obviously just like you shared yesterday, Madam chair, that I don't agree or I'm against some of the other items.",210,,
1010,0.97,6435.996,6443.703,I'm trying to focusing on what I know works and Aurora Commons works.,210,,
1011,0.97,6443.703,6443.97,Okay.,211,,
1012,0.97,6443.97,6447.24,Council member Juarez is joined by Pedersen and Strauss.,211,,
1013,0.97,6447.24,6455.715,"And joining them is Council member Herbold, Morales, Sawant, Lewis and Council President Gonzalez.",211,,
1014,0.97,6455.715,6456.55,Thank you all very much.,211,,
1015,0.97,6456.55,6462.122,Let's move on to the next item.,211,,
1016,0.97,6462.122,6463.49,Chair Mosqueda.,212,,
1017,0.97,6463.49,6464.457,I'm sorry.,213,,
1018,0.97,6464.457,6467.06,"Council member Sawant, please go ahead.",213,,
1019,0.97,6467.06,6467.661,I just --,214,,
1020,0.97,6467.661,6470.463,On the previous item.,215,,
1021,0.97,6470.463,6470.897,Yeah.,216,,
1022,0.97,6470.897,6474.401,The report on city wide diversion program.,216,,
1023,0.97,6474.401,6481.141,I just wanted to add my name to it.,216,,
1024,0.97,6481.141,6483.743,Can you say that again Council member Sawant?,217,,
1025,0.97,6483.743,6484.044,I'm sorry.,217,,
1026,0.97,6484.044,6493.32,"It was the agenda item related to the report on the city wide diversion program, report on demand.",218,,
1027,0.97,6493.32,6493.92,Okay.,219,,
1028,0.97,6493.92,6494.221,Number 11.,219,,
1029,0.97,6494.221,6497.123,"Number 11, yes.",220,,
1030,0.97,6497.123,6505.966,Sponsored by Council member Herbold.,221,,
1031,0.97,6505.966,6510.07,Okay . S that was the slide.,221,,
1032,0.97,6510.07,6513.24,We will make sure that you are included.,221,,
1033,0.97,6513.24,6519.579,"And then just for the viewing public, we are going to item number 12 which is what we just discussed.",221,,
1034,0.97,6519.579,6527.654,And now we are on number 13 from Council member Herbold.,221,,
1035,0.97,6527.654,6528.421,I'm sorry.,221,,
1036,0.97,6528.421,6535.395,Amy and then Council member Herbold.,221,,
1037,0.97,6535.395,6546.006,It is sponsored by Council member Herbold as the primary sponsor.,222,,
1038,0.97,6546.006,6551.511,It would cut $10 million from Finance general for the equitable communities initiative.,222,,
1039,0.97,6551.511,6560.687,Second it would add $10 million to Hsd for Community-Led investments and third impose a proviso on the $10 million.,222,,
1040,0.97,6560.687,6571.531,As part of the summer budgetary vision Council Aappropriate rated $4 million for prevention efforts and $10 million for safety programs.,222,,
1041,0.97,6571.531,6593.853,In a letter from deputy Mayor it stated that the 4 million would be spent in 2020 but the 10 million would be distributed through an Rfp process but it would not occur in 2020 and therefore the appropriation would lapse.,222,,
1042,0.97,6593.853,6598.725,The loan authorized by Council to cover both adds would not be executed.,222,,
1043,0.97,6598.725,6610.804,This budget action would cut the 10 million from the 2021 budget for the initiative and add those funds to Hsd to fund Scaling financed safety programs as intended in the 2020 budget.,222,,
1044,0.97,6610.804,6618.378,We are working on the action required for the 3.1 million of the 4 million appropriation in the budget.,222,,
1045,0.97,6618.378,6622.082,I would like to make a note about the proviso language in the action.,222,,
1046,0.97,6622.082,6635.895,My intention was to apply the same proviso that was included in ordinance 126148 to the proposed 2021 funding by inadvertently used an earlier language.,222,,
1047,0.97,6635.895,6644.704,I will be able to promote the proviso language in the next version of the budget action.,222,,
1048,0.97,6644.704,6649.542,With that I will turn it over to Council member Herbold.,222,,
1049,0.97,6649.542,6650.777,Thank you.,223,,
1050,0.97,6650.777,6651.277,Council member Herbold.,223,,
1051,0.97,6651.277,6653.513,Thank you so much.,224,,
1052,0.97,6653.513,6661.755,Appreciate the reminder that this is funding that the Council has voted twice to provide.,224,,
1053,0.97,6661.755,6665.825,First in approving Council bill during our 2020 rebalancing process.,224,,
1054,0.97,6665.825,6672.065,And then again in overturning the Mayor's veto of it.,224,,
1055,0.97,6672.065,6681.141,"Many thanks to my cosponsors, council member Sawant and Council President Gonzalez.",224,,
1056,0.97,6681.141,6696.656,This commitment to distribute these funds through Hsd I think has been received in our letter from senior deputy Mayor Fong.,224,,
1057,0.97,6696.656,6716.776,But there is not a clear path for how this would be funded because the counsel's action during the rebalancing process over the summer was to authorize an inner fund loan that the executive has stated that they do not intend to take.,224,,
1058,0.97,6716.776,6723.283,Thus creating an unbalanced budge the for 2021.,224,,
1059,0.97,6723.283,6733.76,So the $10 million is a high priority and a key request of the Decriminalize Seattle.,224,,
1060,0.97,6733.76,6746.573,During our process over the summer I have been speaking to the executive boat the Mayor's office and the human services director about the plans for allocating these funds.,224,,
1061,0.97,6746.573,6750.977,I met with director Johnston just yesterday.,224,,
1062,0.97,6750.977,6762.188,And I understand that director Johnson has shared a proposal to the Mayor's office to discuss the next steps forward in developing the Rfp.,224,,
1063,0.97,6762.188,6764.457,I'm continuing to monitor their progress.,224,,
1064,0.97,6764.457,6769.896,And I believe that Hsd is acting in good faith.,224,,
1065,0.97,6769.896,6773.666,As it relates to specifically developing the Rfp.,224,,
1066,0.97,6773.666,6779.072,Just as a matter of detail that might be useful for folks.,224,,
1067,0.97,6779.072,6796.156,The commitment that we received in the letter from senior deputy Mayor Fong back on September 30th indicated that Hsd would be working with community and developing the Rfp itself.,224,,
1068,0.97,6796.156,6819.279,"So rather than Hsd issuing the Rfp without having deepen deep engagement around the investments they proposed, this will be a collaborative process with community and with service providers.",224,,
1069,0.97,6819.279,6850.31,I have actually requested that Dr. Johnson consider the intercept model as a way of doing a gaps analysis for where we need additional investments and really taking a look at where--where we want to put our greatest investments along the intercept model and director Johnson has expressed an interest in considering using that model sort of as the framework.,224,,
1070,0.97,6850.31,6869.062,With that I appreciate receiving any additional questions and hope to get your support for this high priority community and Council investment.,224,,
1071,0.97,6869.062,6872.532,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",225,,
1072,0.97,6872.532,6874.567,Are there any additional questions?,225,,
1073,0.97,6874.567,6879.772,"Council member Sawant, please go ahead.",225,,
1074,0.97,6879.772,6881.374,So Yeah.,226,,
1075,0.97,6881.374,6884.344,I've already cosponsored this amendment.,226,,
1076,0.97,6884.344,6885.812,So I definitely support it.,226,,
1077,0.97,6885.812,6906.466,Just wanted to note for members of the viewing public one ongoing major problem with the public accountability it can only allocate funds and is not the body that spends the allocated funds.,226,,
1078,0.97,6906.466,6933.726,That means that they are placed in a bank account available for a purpose but then it is the Mayor's office and the departments that serve at her behest who--and their work--I mean those decisions are not made in public but the Mayor has the authority to spend those funds.,226,,
1079,0.97,6933.726,6943.069,This year the Mayor announced $100 million to be allocated in communities of color.,226,,
1080,0.97,6943.069,6948.741,There is no guarantee that the investments will happen or that the communities will see the funds.,226,,
1081,0.97,6948.741,6957.684,This budget amendment moves $10 million of those funds out of one bank account that the Mayor controlled to another bank account that the Mayor controls.,226,,
1082,0.97,6957.684,6960.453,Effectively it is what it happening.,226,,
1083,0.97,6960.453,6962.989,It limits how the funds can be invested.,226,,
1084,0.97,6962.989,6973.433,But legally there is nothing that requires the funds--it is holding the Mayor's office politically accountable.,226,,
1085,0.97,6973.433,6974.5,I wanted to point that out.,226,,
1086,0.97,6974.5,6977.904,Like I said I have cosponsored this budget amendment.,226,,
1087,0.97,6977.904,6979.038,I think it is important.,226,,
1088,0.97,6979.038,6990.65,And members of the public should keep in mind that the only thing that will hold the Mayor accountability will be the vigilance of a grass roots movement.,226,,
1089,0.97,6990.65,6991.617,Thank you very much.,227,,
1090,0.97,6991.617,6995.154,"Council member Herbold, I appreciate your creative thinking on this.",227,,
1091,0.97,6995.154,7001.094,I know there are many people on the community who are eagerly awaiting these funds.,227,,
1092,0.97,7001.094,7006.399,To make sure there is appropriate response capacity in the community.,227,,
1093,0.97,7006.399,7009.736,This is a critical step in that process.,227,,
1094,0.97,7009.736,7016.609,Is it fair to say that you have identified a fund source because of that lack of action?,227,,
1095,0.97,7016.609,7020.313,Maybe that's the wrong way to put it.,227,,
1096,0.97,7020.313,7031.591,Lack of certainty that the fund source that we originally identified was going to be acted upon and that you're open as well to other fund sources.,227,,
1097,0.97,7031.591,7032.325,Yeah.,228,,
1098,0.97,7032.325,7032.692,Absolutely.,228,,
1099,0.97,7032.692,7040.733,"During issue identification, the central staff identified potential fund sources.",228,,
1100,0.97,7040.733,7055.348,"They also suggested that if we thought the Mayor's office would have a change of heart in 2021, we could authority a 2021 Interfund loan.",228,,
1101,0.97,7055.348,7072.532,"Given that I don't have an indication that there has been a change of heart in the Mayor's office to do what we asked them to do in 2020 to do so in 2021, I did propose the use of this particular fund source.",228,,
1102,0.97,7072.532,7081.107,"Again, this is, again, one of the options that has been provided by central staff.",228,,
1103,0.97,7081.107,7088.448,But also something that we're hearing from community around this particular fund source as well.,228,,
1104,0.97,7088.448,7096.522,Is that the commitments that the Council has made prior are higher priority.,228,,
1105,0.97,7096.522,7098.491,Thank you for that.,229,,
1106,0.97,7098.491,7100.793,Any additional comments or questions?,229,,
1107,0.97,7100.793,7101.094,Wonderful.,229,,
1108,0.97,7101.094,7106.232,Thank you for that clarification Herbold.,229,,
1109,0.97,7106.232,7110.536,I see this making sure that the $10 million commitment is followed through on.,229,,
1110,0.97,7110.536,7112.972,I appreciate that clarification.,229,,
1111,0.97,7112.972,7120.513,Colleagues I see Council member Herbold joined by Sawant and Gonzalez and Morales and Lewis.,229,,
1112,0.97,7120.513,7120.813,Wonderful.,229,,
1113,0.97,7120.813,7121.647,Thank you so much.,229,,
1114,0.97,7121.647,7124.817,Let's move to the next item.,229,,
1115,0.97,7223.316,7242.268,Just this summer as part of the rebalancing package the Council unanimous restored that that was inadvertently omitted from the carry forward ordinance.,230,,
1116,0.97,7242.268,7258.584,The ACLU attended my September 27th--22nd public safety and human services commitment along with King County public health to brief the Council on a proposed new approach to the model.,230,,
1117,0.97,7258.584,7274.867,And this new in approach is simply not relying on establishing a--and building constructing a new bricks and mortar location to provide these services.,230,,
1118,0.97,7274.867,7287.179,"Provided this new approach is--I have informed, I should say, this--director Johnson of this new approach and asked for feedback.",230,,
1119,0.97,7287.179,7292.418,I understand that that information has been shared with the Mayor's office.,230,,
1120,0.97,7292.418,7304.13,And we may have--some of you may have seen recently that the Seattle times report that the Mayor's office said that the Mayor was Interesed in learning more how the proposal could work.,230,,
1121,0.97,7304.13,7320.479,"And just, you know, for now this action just simply moves money from Finance general to the human services Department so we can begin having these conversations.",230,,
1122,0.97,7320.479,7320.78,Thank you.,230,,
1123,0.97,7320.78,7322.882,Are there questions?,231,,
1124,0.97,7322.882,7332.958,"Council member Sawant, please go ahead.",231,,
1125,0.97,7332.958,7334.26,Thank you.,232,,
1126,0.97,7334.26,7341.167,This is--I have indicated my support for this already.,232,,
1127,0.97,7341.167,7358.084,This is an example of funding that the Mayor year after year has failed to failed to actually use funds allocated by the sit counsel's budget decision.,232,,
1128,0.97,7358.084,7365.024,The allocation of that $1.4 million was a budget amendment fought for and won by the budget movement.,232,,
1129,0.97,7365.024,7367.526,And either in 2017 or 2018.,232,,
1130,0.97,7367.526,7380.973,"But after it was allocated, the Mayor shamefully refused to use the funds while Opioid addiction spread in the city and the region and in the country.",232,,
1131,0.97,7380.973,7390.549,So I would urge the Mayor to stop the--of these funds and urge other Council members as well.,232,,
1132,0.97,7390.549,7393.753,Thank you Council member Sawant.,233,,
1133,0.97,7393.753,7398.858,This has been one of those issues that was present when I first got sworn in.,233,,
1134,0.97,7398.858,7406.132,Here we are working on it for the last year of my term here.,233,,
1135,0.97,7406.132,7411.337,Let's see if we can get--Council member Strauss please go ahead.,233,,
1136,0.97,7411.337,7415.274,Thank you chair and Council member Herbold for bringing this forward.,234,,
1137,0.97,7415.274,7417.81,I'm simply checking my understanding.,234,,
1138,0.97,7417.81,7427.92,Is this a program that is already existing and this is adding dollars to that program or is this standing it up?,234,,
1139,0.97,7427.92,7428.154,No.,235,,
1140,0.97,7428.154,7448.107,This is--this is funding that the Council allocated and parked in finance general in 2018 in order to start the--in order to develop and build locations.,235,,
1141,0.97,7448.107,7454.78,So the plan endorsed by King County public health at the time was to build stand alone facilities.,235,,
1142,0.97,7454.78,7456.749,The money has been parked in finance general.,235,,
1143,0.97,7456.749,7471.664,The plan now is not to build stand alone facilities but to fund existing organizations that provide drug treatment services to provide this particular suite of services.,235,,
1144,0.97,7471.664,7479.238,So this is not an existing program.,235,,
1145,0.97,7479.238,7486.812,It is funding for a program that we earmarked back in 2018 that has not been allocated yet.,235,,
1146,0.97,7486.812,7493.085,"What I heard as well as the question of actually not--we're funding existing programs, right?",236,,
1147,0.97,7493.085,7496.055,We're not standing up new programs with these funds?,236,,
1148,0.97,7496.055,7498.09,"Is that correct, council member Herbold?",236,,
1149,0.97,7498.09,7504.597,We are not standing up--I mean I guess it depends on how you define programs.,237,,
1150,0.97,7504.597,7515.374,We would be funding new services.,237,,
1151,0.97,7515.374,7515.975,Existing organizations.,238,,
1152,0.97,7515.975,7516.809,Correct.,239,,
1153,0.97,7516.809,7517.109,Okay.,240,,
1154,0.97,7517.109,7518.043,Any additional questions?,240,,
1155,0.97,7518.043,7518.644,All right.,240,,
1156,0.97,7518.644,7519.378,Here we go.,240,,
1157,0.97,7519.378,7534.026,"I see Council member Herbold, I had Council member Morales, Gonzalez, joined by Council member Morales Strauss, council member Sawant.",240,,
1158,0.97,7534.026,7534.426,That's everyone.,240,,
1159,0.97,7534.426,7535.027,Thank you so much.,240,,
1160,0.97,7535.027,7542.401,Let's go to the next item.,240,,
1161,0.97,7542.401,7551.644,"Number 13 adds $200,000 in general fund to Hsd to increase harm reduction programs and impose a proviso.",241,,
1162,0.97,7551.644,7556.181,It is sponsored by Herbold.,241,,
1163,0.97,7556.181,7567.426,This would increase the head of the services of the existing agencies that could provide to reduce harm.,241,,
1164,0.97,7567.426,7573.132,Perhaps increasing staff to offer new types of programs or at additional locations.,241,,
1165,0.97,7573.132,7588.814,"But new programs some of the examples that have been discussed are peer and community outreach, good neighbor agreements that would do syringe pickup in the area and providing incentives for Medicare reimbursement for certain types of services.",241,,
1166,0.97,7588.814,7593.052,With that I will turn it over to Council member Herbold.,241,,
1167,0.97,7593.052,7593.819,Thank you.,242,,
1168,0.97,7593.819,7594.353,Council member Herbold.,242,,
1169,0.97,7594.353,7596.855,Thank you.,243,,
1170,0.97,7596.855,7614.974,"Similar to the previous item discussed, this does not so much create any new programs but it expands the access to services of existing programs.",243,,
1171,0.97,7614.974,7624.416,I appreciate the access to help and developing this budget to combat the steady rising Overdose deaths in King County since 2011.,243,,
1172,0.97,7624.416,7633.125,The committee meeting that I mentioned earlier heard data on the rise in Overdose deaths just last month from public health.,243,,
1173,0.97,7633.125,7645.371,"For the benefit of the viewing public, just want folks to understand that just access to help is an organization that recommends immediate solutions for drug use or help.",243,,
1174,0.97,7645.371,7650.342,That also increases the safety and health of all of our communities.,243,,
1175,0.97,7650.342,7664.723,They recognize that the war on drugs has a disproportionate impact on communities without contributing to public safety and health and they advocate for using resources on proven responses that lack funding.,243,,
1176,0.97,7664.723,7677.302,So this budget action would--public approach to serve drug users with the goal of expanding the availability of services for drug users.,243,,
1177,0.97,7677.302,7685.511,"This includes organizations such as reach, hepatitis education project and Aurora Commons.",243,,
1178,0.97,7685.511,7694.019,This is designed to be flexible and allow the organizations to expand the type of that would be most Impactfu.,243,,
1179,0.97,7694.019,7699.725,That could include expanding staff or service hours.,243,,
1180,0.97,7699.725,7712.371,So that organizations could engage with people at--more people at additional times.,243,,
1181,0.97,7712.371,7716.975,It could include adding another location.,243,,
1182,0.97,7716.975,7720.212,Such as medical consultation.,243,,
1183,0.97,7720.212,7736.662,"And as mentioned one organization is considering launching a good neighbor peer program which would put peers to work during good neighbor outreach in their community, including Encampments and picking up dirty Syringes.",243,,
1184,0.97,7736.662,7742.701,This funding could help them launch that program or similar efforts that would increase public health and safety.,243,,
1185,0.97,7742.701,7810.569,"And I just--as it relates to that last point, the city auditor's report from last year around the provision of better hygiene throughout the city and the collection of garbage and provision of health programs in response to the proliferation of outdoor Encampments and Rvs has identified other cities that actually as part of their contracts with Hsd providers actually included this commitment to this type of good neighbor agreement that the providers will then work with folks in the area surrounding the physical location of the organization to do things like syringe pickup, bargaining pickup and building relationships with folk that's work and live nearby.",243,,
1186,0.97,7810.569,7814.606,This is something that I lifted up through a slide in last year's budget process.,243,,
1187,0.97,7814.606,7819.444,It did not actually move forward.,243,,
1188,0.97,7819.444,7826.151,Because the chair was thinning the number of slides in the final budget.,243,,
1189,0.97,7826.151,7834.326,I'm really excited that a service provider is considering launching a good neighbor program like this and using the fund to do so.,243,,
1190,0.97,7834.326,7842.467,I think it would be a really good--a good way to promote these best practices.,243,,
1191,0.97,7842.467,7842.768,Thank you.,243,,
1192,0.97,7842.768,7843.402,Thank you very much.,244,,
1193,0.97,7843.402,7851.91,Are there any additional questions from--for Council member Herbold?,244,,
1194,0.97,7851.91,7864.856,"I'm not seeing any--I do want to ask Council member Herbold, is there a nexus here as well with the item that we just considered similar type programs.",244,,
1195,0.97,7864.856,7865.123,Yeah.,245,,
1196,0.97,7865.123,7872.064,I did ask that question of our community Stakeholders.,245,,
1197,0.97,7872.064,7883.809,The suite of services as recommended through King County public health that led to the recommendations are distinct.,245,,
1198,0.97,7883.809,7893.418,And so that funding that the coups Aappropriate rated in 2018 is distinct for that sweet of services.,245,,
1199,0.97,7893.418,7918.577,"This proposed 200,000 I think is intended to be a little more flexible and not tied to implementing those can you think County public health recommendations but more tied to working with the providers and their clients to figure out what other things can we do to better serve clients and also address needs identified in the community.",245,,
1200,0.97,7918.577,7918.944,Excellent.,246,,
1201,0.97,7918.944,7919.244,Thank you.,246,,
1202,0.97,7919.244,7923.548,I'm not seeing any additional hands at this time.,246,,
1203,0.97,7923.548,7924.116,We will summarize.,246,,
1204,0.97,7924.116,7931.056,We have Council member Herbold joined by Juarez and Lewis.,246,,
1205,0.97,7931.056,7936.428,"Joined which Sawant, Council President Gonzalez and Council member Strauss.",246,,
1206,0.97,7936.428,7940.165,Thank you all very much.,246,,
1207,0.97,7940.165,7940.399,Yep.,246,,
1208,0.97,7940.399,7940.899,That looks like it.,246,,
1209,0.97,7940.899,7941.5,Thank you very much.,246,,
1210,0.97,7941.5,7947.072,Let's go on to the next section.,246,,
1211,0.97,7947.072,7951.143,"Good morning, Council members.",247,,
1212,0.97,7951.143,7966.491,The next item on the agenda is Cbasfd-001-A-00.,247,,
1213,0.97,7966.491,7977.035,"It would add $337,702 general fund to add positions to Seattle fire Department for health one expansion and he I am prose a proviso on the Hsd to support the health one program.",247,,
1214,0.97,7977.035,7984.509,I had a deeper conversation with the sponsor and I will update for a better intent.,247,,
1215,0.97,7984.509,7999.324,The update would reduce the number of staff members assigned to the health one team and it would also eliminate the proviso as Sfd and Nhd have a staffing agreement.,247,,
1216,0.97,7999.324,8010.168,Determine whether there is staff that could be focused on health one work or require three positions as to Hsd and the next version of the SBA would reflect that information.,247,,
1217,0.97,8010.168,8016.274,Finally this updated SBA would exempt the vehicles from any planned fleet reduction.,247,,
1218,0.97,8016.274,8021.98,"With that, I will turn it over to you budget chairman Mosqueda.",247,,
1219,0.97,8021.98,8022.848,"Thank you, Carlos.",248,,
1220,0.97,8022.848,8026.118,And thank you for your work to update the form as well.,248,,
1221,0.97,8026.118,8028.42,Appreciate the clarification this morning.,248,,
1222,0.97,8028.42,8032.491,I want to thank our cosponsors.,248,,
1223,0.97,8032.491,8037.996,And I know Juarez has signaled her interest in signing in on.,248,,
1224,0.97,8037.996,8049.007,This the folks that have a ride along or read up about this award winning program know that the program is part of the Seattle fire Department's Mobilent grated response unit.,248,,
1225,0.97,8049.007,8062.287,This started just in 2019 but has already shown significant reduction in the number of calls from the police and firefighters and freeing up our first responders to respond to emergencies that they have been trained for.,248,,
1226,0.97,8062.287,8085.844,This program helps divert 911 calls for medical related calls and what it is our sincere interest along with the members of the fire Department is making sure this is not just in pockets of the city but can be spread throughout our city to provide effective and targeted trauma informed care to those who they are serving.,248,,
1227,0.97,8085.844,8090.749,42% of medical calls received by Seattle fire Department fell in that category.,248,,
1228,0.97,8090.749,8104.596,Meaning the Rollout of the engine was important and helping to free up individuals who are already facing severe personnel shortage given the compounding crisis both in our city but across the country as well.,248,,
1229,0.97,8104.596,8113.738,"We want to thank our fire Department members who have been deployed to other states like Oregon and California, picking up and helping other departments with fighting fires there.",248,,
1230,0.97,8113.738,8120.245,We want to thank our fire Department members who have been providing additional support at the Covid testing centers.,248,,
1231,0.97,8120.245,8126.084,People who are pulling multiple shifts in a row to make sure there is sufficient personnel out there.,248,,
1232,0.97,8126.084,8139.164,We have a sincere interest in making sure there are enough firefighters to do the jobs that they have already signed up for and make sure that we're Scaling up this incredible system we have already invested in through health one.,248,,
1233,0.97,8139.164,8145.303,Staffed with a team of two specially trained fire Department personnel and one civilian social worker.,248,,
1234,0.97,8145.303,8153.311,We have had the chance to ride along with the health one team and are appreciative that the proposed budget included Scaling up to two teams.,248,,
1235,0.97,8153.311,8173.465,"However we know with additional needs throughout our city it is incredibly important for us to do everything that we can to make sure that there's additional personnel to respond to issues like Nonemergency medical issues, those who need access to services, individual who's are suffering from substance Addictions.",248,,
1236,0.97,8173.465,8176.501,And this is also true for our housed and Unhoused neighbors.,248,,
1237,0.97,8176.501,8184.876,Health one has limited availability currently and would like to expand the program to all five areas of the city.,248,,
1238,0.97,8184.876,8191.816,Their program is Scalable as we have heard directly from the chief and those who work within health one.,248,,
1239,0.97,8191.816,8198.123,We want to bring the expansion in 2021 to two vans up to three vans.,248,,
1240,0.97,8198.123,8199.658,Three units by mid year next year.,248,,
1241,0.97,8199.658,8220.879,"So as you heard from Carlos, this program--this proviso would add two firefighters to the health one team by mid year and assign two social workers with case management experience from Hsd with experiencing people with diverse needs including chronic conditions experienced by members of our community.",248,,
1242,0.97,8220.879,8226.084,That includes services for individuals with disabilities and our elder community as well.,248,,
1243,0.97,8226.084,8240.799,This would include as requested from our conversations with the team at health one a specialist to provide behind the scenes triage and referrals as they expand the number of units they have.,248,,
1244,0.97,8240.799,8249.841,We have to make sure that they have the back of office support to make sure that the assignments are going out.,248,,
1245,0.97,8249.841,8256.581,Health one is only ten months into their first year running.,248,,
1246,0.97,8256.581,8265.79,"Chief Seattle Club, Asian counseling and referral services and continuing to expand and Express interest in working with additional community led organizations.",248,,
1247,0.97,8265.79,8274.566,Current client makeup of those who have received care and ongoing services from the health one teams is about 50% people of color.,248,,
1248,0.97,8274.566,8285.744,"They provide case management and referrals to mental health counselors, housing services and help to make sure that people are not just experiencing a revolving door at harbor view.",248,,
1249,0.97,8285.744,8303.528,They are not seeking to duplicate the King County mental health model nor is it meant to be a duplication of the community led organizations who are experienced in harm reduction and intervention strategies.,248,,
1250,0.97,8303.528,8307.265,It is integrated into the 911 response system.,248,,
1251,0.97,8307.265,8323.982,"They have the ability to send out medically trained personnel to show up for low Acutity issues and do Handoffs to other community organizations and make sure that it is them, the health one team, that is showing up first when the calls come in to 911.",248,,
1252,0.97,8323.982,8326.151,"Again, this program is Scalable.",248,,
1253,0.97,8326.151,8346.037,"It is ready now and it is fully capable of being a strong partner with our led organizations providing an additional way to ensure that there is a Nonarmed individual signing up--sorry, showing up when Whew we really need is a harm reduction model.",248,,
1254,0.97,8346.037,8350.875,Currently our firefighters are answering the low Acutity issues.,248,,
1255,0.97,8350.875,8354.245,It frees up the frights to fight fires.,248,,
1256,0.97,8354.245,8356.081,And really excited about this partnership here.,248,,
1257,0.97,8356.081,8363.221,"And from a public health intervention model, I think it is--it is the right thing to do at this moment.",248,,
1258,0.97,8363.221,8373.798,And looking forward to having this be complimentary to those other public health harm reduction strategies that are both community led and in partnership with King County.,248,,
1259,0.97,8373.798,8374.733,"Council member Herbold, please go ahead.",248,,
1260,0.97,8374.733,8376.101,Thank you.,249,,
1261,0.97,8376.101,8389.547,I would just like to understand a little bit more about how the five positions in Hsd would--what their role would be.,249,,
1262,0.97,8389.547,8403.828,"As you mentioned, chair Mosqueda, the health one unit communicates when they have needs greater than those that they can--that they can assist with.",249,,
1263,0.97,8403.828,8413.171,They communicate with our community service providers to provide those enhanced services.,249,,
1264,0.97,8413.171,8436.161,I'm not quite sure I understand why we need Hsd to provide social work and case management services when--what I think we really want is we want to support the Community-Based organizations that provide these services.,249,,
1265,0.97,8436.161,8436.828,That's correct.,250,,
1266,0.97,8436.828,8441.366,"Council member Herbold, there is not actually five Hsd members.",250,,
1267,0.97,8441.366,8446.771,Carlos mentioned at the beginning that this form was going to be amended.,250,,
1268,0.97,8446.771,8450.475,"But I do want to clarify, absolutely.",250,,
1269,0.97,8450.475,8462.487,"This team does the Handoff to community organizations that really have, you know, trusted partnerships in diverse communities and working with organizations that do housing assistance and ongoing case management.",250,,
1270,0.97,8462.487,8470.461,But the current model is a memorandum of understanding with Hsd to allocate a case worker to be part of the initial team that shows up.,250,,
1271,0.97,8470.461,8482.54,So the current team is two firefighters and one case worker that go around in the actual Van and show up and serve people and triage on the spot in community.,250,,
1272,0.97,8482.54,8490.381,So the proposal here would be to allocate two additional Hsd case workers to be part of that initial team.,250,,
1273,0.97,8490.381,8493.451,But not to do the ongoing case management.,250,,
1274,0.97,8493.451,8495.42,It would only be part of that team.,250,,
1275,0.97,8495.42,8501.025,And then the third person would be an administrative support person behind the scenes.,250,,
1276,0.97,8501.025,8507.732,The current model is a memorandum of understanding with Hsd to provide the case manager that is part of the team.,250,,
1277,0.97,8507.732,8509.801,But I understand where the confusion is.,250,,
1278,0.97,8509.801,8511.569,And I apologize for that.,250,,
1279,0.97,8511.569,8513.404,Does that help clear up?,250,,
1280,0.97,8513.404,8514.505,It helps a great deal.,251,,
1281,0.97,8514.505,8548.606,I just think one of the things that I had heard earlier was sort of a concern that we are--we're increasing funding for the fire Department element of this program without--maybe this was handled in the earlier version but people didn't understand.,251,,
1282,0.97,8548.606,8564.722,Thatthey are reliant--thank you for the clarification.,251,,
1283,0.97,8564.722,8569.027,And I'm going to raise my hand.,251,,
1284,0.97,8569.027,8569.427,Excellent.,252,,
1285,0.97,8569.427,8570.929,Thank you very much.,252,,
1286,0.97,8570.929,8574.499,Any additional questions or comments?,252,,
1287,0.97,8574.499,8579.037,I want to thank all of you.,252,,
1288,0.97,8579.037,8583.308,I know that many of you have done the ride along with the health one team.,252,,
1289,0.97,8583.308,8587.045,If you're able given the current crisis of Covid.,252,,
1290,0.97,8587.045,8589.914,Not everyone is able to go out there.,252,,
1291,0.97,8589.914,8600.592,"Really appreciate what you are able to do, which is support this and to lift this issue up right now this program is offering about 36 hours of service a week.",252,,
1292,0.97,8600.592,8609.334,"And so being able to expand to two, and then three vans is going to be able to provide much more services across the city.",252,,
1293,0.97,8609.334,8615.573,"We know that since this program has launched, there has already been 834 incidents.",252,,
1294,0.97,8615.573,8621.98,About 25% have been direct referrals from the 911 system and 35% have been request from firefighters Oscine.,252,,
1295,0.97,8621.98,8639.43,This is a great way for us to show up with that compassionate care lens with the case managers and as Council member Herbold said to really do the follow-through so there is the warm hands off to community partners and it makes it so people are not just rushing from scene to scene given the high volume of calls.,252,,
1296,0.97,8639.43,8640.631,Appreciate your support.,252,,
1297,0.97,8640.631,8650.608,"In addition to Juarez and Lewis, I see Council members Herbold, Sawant, Pedersen.",252,,
1298,0.97,8650.608,8650.842,Sorry.,252,,
1299,0.97,8650.842,8660.618,"In addition to Council member Strauss and Lewis we have Juarez, Herbold, Sawant, Pedersen and Council President Gonzalez.",252,,
1300,0.97,8660.618,8662.053,Thank you all very much.,252,,
1301,0.97,8662.053,8668.259,Let's go on to the next item.,252,,
1302,0.97,8668.259,8668.76,"Thank you, Carlos.",252,,
1303,0.97,8668.76,8675.199,Good morning Madam chair examine members of the committee.,253,,
1304,0.97,8675.199,8680.605,Greg Doss central staff to walk you through the next four items.,253,,
1305,0.97,8680.605,8692.383,The next CBA is Sfd-002-A-001 brought to you by Council member Herbold and Juarez and Council member Strauss and Council member Gonzalez.,253,,
1306,0.97,8692.383,8706.264,"This particular item as you can see adds $383,000 to the fire Department to fund external Defibrillators Lucas devices and ballistic sets.",253,,

1315,0.97,8744.569,8751.709,Greg did a great job of covering this.,255,,
1316,0.97,8751.709,8761.652,The--the Union local 27 has indicated that the Department is underfunded to maintain and replace its compliment Tiff Aeds.,255,,
1317,0.97,8761.652,8765.389,This is a high priority for local 27.,255,,
1318,0.97,8765.389,8771.095,And just want to take this opportunity to make a note.,255,,
1319,0.97,8771.095,8788.446,"In case you're missing a previous form B that you may have had interest in from the earlier round of budget discussions, my form a for Bunking gear is not listed.",255,,
1320,0.97,8788.446,8791.716,We sort of tracked down through some questions to the budget office.,255,,
1321,0.97,8791.716,8796.42,And we have been assured there is no deficit of what is called Bunking gear.,255,,
1322,0.97,8796.42,8804.395,And it is on a ten-year replacement cycle with all firefighters having two sets that are not expired.,255,,
1323,0.97,8804.395,8829.787,"Knowing that really allows me and hopefully my colleagues on the Council to put priority emphasis on behalf of the Seattle fire Department's needs on this item 15, the automated external Defibrillators, Lucas devices and ballistic sets and the action that will follow.",255,,
1324,0.97,8829.787,8830.154,Excellent.,256,,
1325,0.97,8830.154,8834.859,Thank you Council member Herbold and thank you for the clarification on that form a as well.,256,,
1326,0.97,8834.859,8839.831,Are there questions here on the item in front of us?,257,,
1327,0.97,8839.831,8840.031,Okay.,257,,
1328,0.97,8840.031,8841.032,'m not seeing any questions.,257,,
1329,0.97,8841.032,8844.435,I do see a lot of hands raised in support.,257,,
1330,0.97,8844.435,8857.114,"So Council member Herbold joined by Council President Gonzalez and Strauss includes now Lewis, Juarez, Pedersen, Sawant and Council member Morales.",257,,
1331,0.97,8857.114,8879.003,Thank you it is to restore a recruit class and what is in the 2021 proposed budget.,257,,
1332,0.97,8879.003,8902.894,"This action is also brought by the council member twister 1.6 million that was cut in the proposed budget in about 1.3 million of that was for preemployment testing, recruitment, and equipment cost and personal cost associated with a 20 firefighter recruit class reduction.",257,,
1333,0.97,8902.894,8978.235,"Normally for the firefighters it would be 60 recruits and this would adopt a $1.3 million reduction and reduce the size of the class to 40 recruits drug addiction in addition this would also reduce about the 219,000 in overtime that is used to administer firefighter written exams on a one-time basis just to put this in a little bit of context, the fire Department has been experiencing above average attrition this year and is 412 firefighters that are audible for determined the restoration of the recruit class and also the testing funding would ensure that there is sufficient staffing I would ensure that firefighters do not suffer from burnout or fatigue having to work overtime shifts to Backfill minimum staffing requirements and with that will turn over to Councilmember Herbold . Thank you.",257,,
1334,0.97,8978.235,8996.253,You just want to let folks know if I've been talking to much this is my last item not just for the morning but for the rest of the day . Thank you . It is been clear for several years that we need to do everything we can to bring on more firefighters to address vacancies in the coming wave of retirement.,258,,
1335,0.97,8996.253,9003.961,"As Greg mentioned, we have a higher level of attrition this year than what was projected at the beginning of the year.",258,,
1336,0.97,9003.961,9100.624,"Last year we worked to expand the recruit class in the budget deliberations those gains would be undone if we do not keep their baseline recruitment . The number of separations this year have been 44 separations for what was expected was 38 and just recognize that firefighters as well as other front-line workers and first responders are under a lot of stress on the front line . Just want to acknowledge that firefighters have stepped up and are managing an incredibly successful Covid testing operation, in addition to doing his regular work . The issue of attrition and separation of the fire Department I think our unique from the discussions that we are having about the police Department and with the police Department are talking about working to restructure the Department to the last of what is historically has been doing in the new duties that they have taken on that we feel that other Non-Sworn Non-Armed responses are more appropriate.",258,,
1337,0.97,9100.624,9140.798,"With the fire Department, that is a different situation that we need the fire Department to do everything that it is doing and it is not a situation that we can simply address a higher- Than-Expected attrition rate by finding other people to do what the fire Department does . that is not something that we can do it for that reason, I just hope that I can get your support for my Othello city Councilmembers that I want to note that this is I believe the highest priority of the Seattle fire Department among other budget items.",258,,
1338,0.97,9140.798,9141.098,Thank you.,258,,
1339,0.97,9141.098,9151.475,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold . Other any additional questions or comments?",259,,

1346,0.97,9179.503,9180.437,Sorry about that.,262,,
1347,0.97,9180.437,9183.741,I see you now.,262,,
1348,0.97,9183.741,9184.241,Thank you.,263,,
1349,0.97,9184.241,9185.242,I just wanted to check.,263,,
1350,0.97,9185.242,9191.549,For the record on what number where we are?,264,,
1351,0.97,9191.549,9201.959,We were on Sfd 003.,265,,
1352,0.97,9202.526,9207.264,"And a my chart that is now number 18 number 17 originally so you got you on, Councilmember Morales.",266,,
1353,0.97,9207.264,9207.932,Thank you so much.,266,,
1354,0.97,9207.932,9244.602,"Okay . the next one is Sfd 004-A-001 and it is a Primer sponsored by Councilmember Lewis cosponsored by Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Strauss and Councilmember Sawant adding 141,000 and one FTE two at a consulting nurse to the fire Department to provide some background when a call comes in.",267,,
1355,0.97,9244.602,9248.405,"A call taker will screen the call to determine if fire, medical, or public safety services are needed.",267,,
1356,0.97,9248.405,9262.853,A fire or medical services are needed it would be transferred to the fire alarm center to be answered by a firefighter who determines what services are needed and sense of the appropriate Sfd responders.,267,,
1357,0.97,9262.853,9276.533,"A nurse would answer the calls and triage the calls providing medical advice and helping to determine what kind of dispatches needed . with that as a basic description, I would turn it over to Councilmember Lewis.",267,,
1358,0.97,9276.533,9277.301,Thank you.,268,,
1359,0.97,9277.301,9335.993,"I will just be brief . This is something that comes from chief Scoggins is something that they want to pursue . They have a hunch that having a consulting nurse would lead to been able to resolve most things over the phone rather than needing to dispatch a Paramedic team or even a health one team, as discussed earlier that this could have an impact on conserving resources and also just on fatigue and firefighter well-being in terms of how many calls they need to respond to and have frequently they need to be responding to those calls . in terms of the structure, if this becomes a bigger part of the practice of the firefighter dispatch, they would need more Ftes.",268,,
1360,0.97,9335.993,9366.423,We can have one consulting nurse and a 24/7 capacity place I think it is appropriate to treat this a little bit like a pilot to put forward the one consulting nurse monitor with the impact of that consulting nurse service has been and then talk in future budget cycles about expanding that service to be a more comprehensive 24/7 component of the firefighter 911 dispatch.,268,,
1361,0.97,9366.423,9386.61,I think it is a good start given the limited resources of this year and can have a really big impact for the community and for our firefighters who are constantly responding to things and maybe able to carve out some of those responses that can be resolved over the phone by speaking with a professional.,268,,
1362,0.97,9386.61,9394.451,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis . other questions or comments?",269,,
1363,0.97,9394.451,9396.954,I do want to just clarify.,270,,
1364,0.97,9396.954,9438.162,This was not a formal request that was made by chief Scoggins . This was something mentioned to me in February of something that would be a useful addition to 911 dispatch but it was pursued by the own volition of my office . I do not want to put them out that he like called me up and requested it but it has been mentioned as something that Coud be useful . I decided to explore it.,270,,
1365,0.97,9438.529,9468.992,This is something we heard from's members who Express showing P to calls that are medical in nature and really having a consulting nurse to triage the calls . It is important to clarify because there has been some confusion that this is not providing a consultant nurse to answer calls better for Nonmedical issues.,271,,
1366,0.97,9468.992,9479.136,As Greg covered and proxy can give a reminder to fix the Council is very aware the when somebody calls 911 if it is a medical issue that goes to the firefighter Department side.,271,,
1367,0.97,9479.136,9508.232,"At that point is where this would come into play if there was a call that could be handled by consulting nurse at that point, they would then handle the call quick there is no confusion on Council I will try to have all 911 calls handled by others but this is helping to reduce the need for our firefighters to be deployed out or even cause that could be handled by a nurse . We are asking for that nurse to be situated on the side of 911.",271,,
1368,0.97,9508.232,9515.272,"Greg, would you add anything to that for additional Equivocation?",271,,
1369,0.97,9515.272,9520.744,You have always had a perfect understanding.,272,,
1370,0.97,9520.744,9521.378,Excellent.,273,,
1371,0.97,9521.378,9524.581,I appreciate the clarification and hope folks are paying attention to that.,273,,
1372,0.97,9524.581,9555.445,"We have a number of folks have signed on to provide additional support for this so in addition to your lead sponsorship for now being aware already joined by Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Strauss and you now have Councilmember Gonzalez, Councilmember Herbold and Pedersen signing on as cosponsors.",274,,
1373,0.97,9555.445,9557.314,I'm just Pausing briefly to make sure I got everyone.,274,,
1374,0.97,9557.314,9558.115,It sounds like we did.,274,,
1375,0.97,9558.115,9558.682,Let's keep going.,274,,
1376,0.97,9558.682,9610.534,"I picked the last one on the fire Department is Sfd-005- A-001 sponsored by yourself in the cosponsored by Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Lewis adding 150,000 FTE and Sfd to fund a crisis counselor with training to focus on De-Escalation, scene safety, and evasive the funds to keep firefighters safe and increase positive interaction with persons in crisis were suffering with mental illness this would also provide firefighters with assistance in managing distress associated with a traumatic environment that they face every day . Without I will turn it back over to you.",275,,
1377,0.97,9610.534,9631.788,Thank you very much . In my conversations with front-line firefighters and they speak of mounting and compounding crises.,276,,
1378,0.97,9631.788,9638.061,Spoke with the number of individuals expressing a potential health crisis and 911 calls Forthose symptomatic with Covid.,276,,
1379,0.97,9638.061,9683.34,Preference provide time during their Non-Firefighter shift over at the testing center people are also experiencing the crisis and the trauma and the mental trauma and it is being made worse and by the Covid presence and also a fact that we now have increasing numbers of folks who are living housing and secure and those who are living homeless in our Street practices in addition to everything they are doing to fight fires both here and with our partner States.,276,,
1380,0.97,9683.34,9744.868,"There is a number of individuals within our firefighting team that expressed that they themselves have seen increases and on a daily basis they respond to those calls we want our firefighters to have the benefit of being safe both on scene and also having the health protections that they need when they go home at a processing everything that I have seen during the day . in the labor movement we have been working for a very long time to make sure that firefighters have the health care that they need, given the high numbers of individual firefighters who have been exposed to toxic chemicals when fighting fires between also have high numbers of cancer cases and die at earlier ages . I see this type of form supporting the health of firefighters as well.",276,,
1381,0.97,9744.868,9770.327,"Not only are they inhaling toxic chemicals, but they see toxic scenes on a daily basis and we want them to have the benefit of having a crisis counselor to provide trauma informed training across the Department and to also make sure that there are counselors available on the process of scenes that are challenging and difficult to be able to process those so they can be at the best for the family, community member, and people they serve.",276,,
1382,0.97,9770.327,9785.709,Also it informs her firefighters interact with people on a daily basis we want them to be able to help process the stress of the city and provide trauma informed care on a daily basis.,276,,
1383,0.97,9785.709,9797.654,One example has come up recently I asked folks if I could share this story.,276,,
1384,0.97,9797.654,9820.944,"Why we need them to be available for the entire Department given the compounding crises many in our community to express high levels of mental health crises, increased number of domestic violence situations, and those for veterans or with Ptsd having a compounding crisis as well and we see this manifested in the street itself.",276,,
1385,0.97,9820.944,9898.054,"And talking with chief Scoggins, he mentioned many of the firefighters one week ago were responded to a call for a young teenage girl had hung herself having the firefighters have to see that and then be at 100% district to the next call, that is a very hard situation to process we know that that type of experience is not unique to what is going on during Covid, but we have seen increased numbers of these calls coming in . It affects how they respond to individuals . have been the type of crisis counselor to inform the care is critical but this is a great example of what they put the care into action and a could read this, I would really appreciate if you would bear with me that firefighters responded to a call and multiple people were yelling she is underwater practices at the pier on the waterfront in downtown Seattle pointing in different directions the firefighter rescue team jumped off the pier and swam underwater to try to find this individual noting that there was only 30 feet of clear visibility underwater I do not see a body.",276,,
1386,0.97,9898.054,9901.258,He then saw a woman hiding.,276,,
1387,0.97,9901.258,9911.635,"In his own words he says, it appeared she was going underwater and was actively avoiding me.",276,,
1388,0.97,9911.635,9914.471,I swam toward her and she looked up scared and ready to go underwater again.,276,,
1389,0.97,9914.471,9915.572,I asked if I could help.,276,,
1390,0.97,9915.572,9927.684,She stared at me and did not reply . I asked if I could hold her hand and I reach and in accordance with my training I started to pull her in to initiate the rescue.,276,,
1391,0.97,9927.684,9938.795,She resisted and said that is not holding my hand.,276,,
1392,0.97,9938.795,9944.267,I released my group and analyst her fingers and she completely relaxed and I asked if she needed a hug and she said that is exactly what I need.,276,,
1393,0.97,9944.267,9953.51,I gave her a hug and I started swimming to initiate the rescue and she pushed away from me and said that is not a hug . I stopped.,276,,
1394,0.97,9953.51,9972.495,I was just floating around her I said you are right . I put my arms around her and I gave her a proper hug and she was stiff and I thought she would push away and then I lifted her arms around me and I said we you put your arms around my shoulder?,276,,
1395,0.97,9972.495,9974.23,Give me a real hug.,276,,
1396,0.97,9974.23,9977.1,She did and she screws me hard.,276,,
1397,0.97,9977.1,9984.107,She said I am just so sad . So I said I know a lot of us are sad right now.,276,,
1398,0.97,9984.107,10008.965,I then swam her to the latter and put her on the pier we got out of the water together . This is an example of where it is just not responding to the call or put in the training for Life- saving mechanisms in place but trying to meet the client or the individual where they are at and using that care to really understand.,276,,
1399,0.97,10008.965,10052.909,Later the firefighter explained that the patient was definitely having a mental health crisis that we want to make sure that we provide as much support as we can to firefighters to respond to situations like this that they can offer the best care and are able to process the scene that they see and the situation like the one with the young woman who committed suicide so that they can be at their best and address the mental health needs of our firefighters and hopefully the ongoing attrition that we have seen to make sure that they have the full support as they go to serve our multiple mobile.,276,,
1400,0.97,10052.909,10100.623,This would add one to hire a counselor to have training that will focus on De-Escalation and scene safety and keep firefighters safe increase in positive interaction for those suffering with illness . This would allow firefighters with help to manage stress and process traumatic events on a daily basis . Trent Rhorer very much thank you very much for how this could be put in place . do you have comments or questions about? thank you for bearing with me as I read that and for your time today.,276,,
1401,0.97,10100.623,10120.777,"Councilmembers Councilmember Herbold, Lewis, Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Gonzalez thank you for your Cosponsorship.",276,,

1404,0.97,10123.646,10155.078,We have about 40 minutes and I would like to see if we can get through ose the terms we have about 40 minutes left and not hearing any objections could you please read the first item that was supposed to be in the second session just for the record and then we will turn over?,278,,
1405,0.97,10155.078,10160.683,Yes . V office of Sustainability and environment.,279,,
1406,0.97,10160.683,10161.784,Excellent.,280,,
1407,0.97,10161.784,10164.721,Thank you.,280,,
1408,0.97,10164.721,10215.939,"We have these items from ose and the first with the Sli ose 001 a 001 and this proposed statement of legislative intent would request that ose and the settled Department of construction and the Department of finance collaborate with the office of Councilmember Lewis to impose a carbon excise tax on commercial buildings and the requested with the specifics of the proposal to include a threshold, tax rate, exemptions, recommendations and resources required to administer the tax.",281,,
1409,0.97,10215.939,10231.921,This anticipates legislation would be refined in the first quarter of 2021 with the goal of having it ready by the end of June anticipating it was referred to the Finance and housing committee.,281,,

1412,0.97,10236.926,10318.241,Thank you . In addition to the consultation those critical departments that breathe mechanical expertise and I really drink at putting the center of the my intent to really have this conversation be community driven on the substance of the policy . I'm not being prescriptive at all in terms of what any revenue from this would go to . I think that would have to go under the community driven process as well in terms of the feedback loop of where it would be reinvested in the community center a lot of the green new deal projects that we have been discussing and debating this could be a great source of funding sort of in the same thinking is how we have a ammunition tax to go toward the research of the victims of gun violence that we have a soda tax to go toward food security and healthy eating.,283,,
1413,0.97,10318.241,10345.368,And it is also to pay for and this could be in the same principle of taxing the emissions of the greenhouse gas emissions to go into a lot of these proposals.,283,,
1414,0.97,10346.769,10384.774,And it is just sort of investigating the general legal framework of doing something and it would be working in a sound and I am convinced it is and that is something where I want to shepherd the process and and also have a B driven by Stakeholders and it is as the additional tool.,283,,
1415,0.97,10384.774,10391.047,Like the soda tax it would go to these kind of investments.,283,,
1416,0.97,10391.047,10405.862,"With that, it is been great to have the corporation to really look into this and have been doing a lot of meeting with potential Stakeholders.",283,,
1417,0.97,10405.862,10420.977,There is a lot of community interest and really diving into this to see if something like this could pencil out and raise revenue to underwrite a lot of these projects and we will see where that process goes next year.,283,,
1418,0.97,10420.977,10442.665,I think it is time we finally explored this . could also be for the state would conversations around taxing carbon as well . often times when Seattle plans a plaque that is the spur that is necessary to see the broader action in Olympia as well.,283,,
1419,0.97,10442.665,10451.674,Hopefully this could serve as an example in the region and would like to see if this can make a difference.,283,,
1420,0.97,10451.674,10466.088,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis . I see Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Strauss were Cosigned and now you have Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Sawant as a.",284,,

1432,0.97,10647.67,10666.222,Thank you for the description to this budget amendment was stores and I would say it again the funding by Mayor Durkan for the green new deal.,289,,
1433,0.97,10666.222,10737.059,"As mentioned, the good news is also clarified by Yolanda is that we heard from the office of Sustainability that this time they have been authorized to hire someone for this position picture in mind Councilmembers of the background, in 2019 climate activists demanded Seattle support the green new deal and the city council passed a resolution student support from many projects and committing to ending greenhouse emissions by 2030. the Council also established a green new deal oversight board to be comprised of impacted communities and technical experts the green new deal oversight board was intended to hold the city establishment accountable for following through on the commitment including making a recommendation to the city budget and it is unfortunate that Mayor Durkan cut the board as part of the hiring freeze in 2020.",289,,
1434,0.97,10737.126,10774.597,"He Council voted to STO funding but the office of Sustainability is not authorized to spend that money until they see it has been restored and 2021, which is what this budget amendment with two Picus has been a key demand of environmental activists and community organizers talked about it the committee meeting that was chaired by my office last month and it is a demand of the solidarity budget and the people's budget.",289,,

1438,0.97,10800.556,10835.658,"The next item is ose 003 a 001 . This would add $150,000 general Fund and a specialist position for the building Tuneups program to support enforcement activities which would be cut in the 2021 proposed budget suspended most of these activities for a year.",291,,
1439,0.97,10835.658,10881.537,"It does contain $45,000 of General fund to fund a technical contract in lieu of providing in-house support, which is what this budget action would be funding acquiring building owners of multifamily and commercial properties to annually report building energy efficiency performance acquiring building owners of commercial facilities 50,000 square feet or larger subject to the benchmark to identify and correct operational deficiencies every five years on average it can reduce building energy use by 10%.",291,,
1440,0.97,10881.537,10917.473,"This would allocate the $100,000 general fund for the position in this position to provide technical assistance to building owners and the $45,000 already included would be used to support the cost and the remaining $50,000 would be used to fund a consultant services like Proactive outreach in particular those located in racial equity priority areas.",291,,
1441,0.97,10917.473,10930.586,"The estimated occurred in first up to $140,000 in fines for both program, $110,000 of this would then be used to fund energy improvements and affordable housing.",291,,
1442,0.97,10930.586,10943.666,It is with the caveat and there is uncertainty with the estimate but that was something I wanted to note for you all.,291,,
1443,0.97,10943.666,10945.401,"Thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez.",292,,
1444,0.97,10945.401,11086.341,"Thank you for the good work on this and also thank you so much to my cosponsors Councilmember Strauss and Councilmember Lewis . During the Department overview process we had an opportunity to hear from director Jessica about some of the proposed cuts that they were making this was one of the cuts that was identified which of course we know is a very small office related to other major Department . back then I expressed concerns about this identified production to the budget and a large part because we know from a report that was published in 2018 related to the city strategies and climate action that 30% of greenhouse emissions actually caused by buildings . 14% of outcomes for residential buildings and 18% from commercial buildings . one of the key strategies to reduce emissions by 2030 and two be carbon neutral by 2030 is to tackle this issue of building energy admissions one of the goals of the city was adopted in 2008 States one of the goals is to reduce building energy emissions by 38% from 2008 levels by 2030. I worry that by pulling back even for just a year in the face of climate change, and we have all been living the impact of climate change this summer was no exception with the Air-Quality hazardous for approximately 10 days in the Seattle area . I worry that taking a year off is just to home to our climate action strategy goals as reiterated in 2018.",293,,
1445,0.97,11086.341,11122.811,I hope that colleagues will join me in this modest restoration of funds to ensure that the city can continue to tackle building energy emissions which make up 30% overall throughout the city prepare the second largest Emitter of greenhouse emissions director said he I think it is important for us to continue to advance this funding in order to make a difference.,293,,
1446,0.97,11122.811,11136.892,Since 2008 since we have implemented these programs around building energy emissions we have seen a 13% decline.,293,,
1447,0.97,11136.892,11148.103,We want to make sure that we can continue to support the progress being made in that particular sector.,293,,
1448,0.97,11148.103,11153.709,Thank you very lunch . I do want to ask one question here.,294,,
1449,0.97,11153.709,11165.521,On page 2 of the summary can you repeat for me? this is actually Revenue-Generating.,294,,
1450,0.97,11165.521,11193.148,It is from fines so what they have explained is that they have spent years working on compliance and now what the Tuna programs they are looking at potentially the soap be the first year instituting the fine for not complying with the regulation.,295,,
1451,0.97,11193.148,11197.753,Others are concerned that the expected fine will not be Recuperated by the city if this were not advanced.,296,,
1452,0.97,11197.753,11207.796,"We would collect no fines and 2021 if the $150,000 is not restored for this purpose.",297,,
1453,0.97,11207.796,11208.964,Anything else to add,298,,
1454,0.97,11208.964,11247.102,Part of the reason that that concern exists is because we will not be engaging in compliance work anymore this space that we have seen measurable improvement in the area of building energy emissions . This is an opportunity for us to make sure we do not lose that muscle memory and the instances where there is issues related to enforcement.,299,,
1455,0.97,11247.669,11249.705,Thank you.,299,,
1456,0.97,11249.705,11254.509,Thank you very much.,300,,

1458,0.97,11266.722,11269.424,That concludes our comments on this one and let's go to the next one.,300,,
1459,0.97,11269.424,11287.342,"The next item is Ose-004-A- 001 cosponsored by Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Pedersen adding $140,000 of General fund to the climate policy advisor position to not be funded in the 2021 proposed budget.",301,,
1460,0.97,11287.342,11314.569,"Is responsible for overseeing the implementation developing and implementing a climate impact assessment tool kit, Crating policies to support green jobs, evaluating racial equity an and establishing building performance standards.",301,,

1462,0.97,11338.06,11358.08,Initial work continued through 2019 but without the Tom Lennon is slipped to to staff turnover be expected to move forward with development of the tool kit in a pilot testing phase with select departments.,301,,
1463,0.97,11358.08,11362.918,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Strauss.",302,,
1464,0.97,11362.918,11364.92,Please go ahead.,302,,
1465,0.97,11364.92,11394.116,"The climate policy position was created to oversee the implementation of the climate action plan, develop policies to build green jobs in the racial equity impact of Decarbonization and assist with that assessment tool . The Council established this in September with the help of Councilmember Pedersen.",303,,
1466,0.97,11394.116,11420.075,They have not hired this position at this time . The proposed budget would on fund this position and only hiring and we just cannot wait to implement our climate action plan as we have limited time to make drastic interventions and how we are living because the climate crisis is before us today.,303,,
1467,0.97,11420.075,11420.876,Thank you.,303,,
1468,0.97,11420.876,11440.996,"Councilmember Strauss, I do not see any additional questions on this . I do see a handful of hand and I guess I will ask you a question in the interim.",304,,
1469,0.97,11440.996,11454.075,Is there synergy as well between this and the green new deal advisor position? I understand they are very dedicated to the board that we are creating.,304,,
1470,0.97,11454.075,11465.22,I think I would say the synergy might be closer.,305,,
1471,0.97,11465.22,11466.721,Ose has a vacant initiative program manager.,305,,
1472,0.97,11466.721,11492.247,Would pay the person that the green new deal advisor reports to so there would be a tighter relationship I certainly think there is a lot of overlap in terms of the claimant work where they have a new climate justice director position orienting toward environmental justice that is the focus of all of their work . I certainly can see the complementary skill set for sure.,305,,
1473,0.97,11492.247,11518.84,"Thank you very much it looks like we have a lot of folks sign on to this with Councilmember Strauss joined by Councilmember Morales and Pedersen and is now joined by Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Sawant, Councilmember Lewis, and Councilmember Gonzalez.",306,,
1474,0.97,11518.84,11519.975,The next item here in ose?,306,,
1475,0.97,11519.975,11551.706,"It is Ose-005-A-001 sponsored by Councilmember Strauss and cosponsored by Councilmember Lewis, Councilmember Morales, and Councilmember Pedersen adding 1.8 million general fund to the fresh bucks program to allow them to purchase at farmers markets providing $40 a month of vouchers for 12 months for a total of $480 per recipient.",307,,
1476,0.97,11551.706,11563.518,The 2021 budget would allocate 5.3 million to the fresh bucks program.,307,,
1477,0.97,11563.518,11575.03,I went note that the proposed 1.8 million addition would be enough to provide for all of the people currently on the wait list plus about an additional 230 people.,307,,
1478,0.97,11575.03,11579.1,Thank you very much.,308,,
1479,0.97,11579.1,11614.336,"Thank you . As we know, the fresh bucks program provides qualified residents who are below 80% of the median income with food vouchers extending the budget constraint to provide access to additional fruits and vegetables neighborhood grocery stores, Safeway, and the farmers market who have seen this program a very successful at extending the in individual ability to budget fresh produce at farmers markets.",309,,
1480,0.97,11614.336,11629.351,Now more than ever it is important to ensure committees have access to affordable and healthy food that we currently serve 9061 enrollees with a Waitlist of about 3600.,309,,
1481,0.97,11629.351,11635.49,Ose has been advised that there's been a significant increase in eligibility this year and need since the last enrollment period ended.,309,,
1482,0.97,11635.49,11655.71,This funding would allow ose to enroll the additional people on the Waitlist setting them up to be able to also provide transit vouchers to those who are newly eligible.,309,,
1483,0.97,11655.71,11664.319,This is one of my top priorities because access to fresh food and vegetables is so important.,309,,
1484,0.97,11664.319,11675.13,This program all of the hard costs and the overhead costs are already taking care of.,309,,
1485,0.97,11675.13,11698.253,This budget request was specifically set up to zero out the Waitlist . that is why the dollar amount is $1.8 million and is to provide extra flexibility for new people to become eligible this year to have access to fresh food at local farmers markets and grocery stores.,309,,
1486,0.97,11698.253,11699.921,Thank you.,309,,
1487,0.97,11699.921,11723.778,Thank you . are there any questions or comments here? I just want to repeat something that I think Yolanda said . is also noted this would allow for everybody who's on the Waitlist to be able to receive.,310,,
1488,0.97,11723.778,11746.201,That is correct plus 230 and so ose would then enroll up to 2000 people on a Waitlist because not every person uses all to fund additional vouchers so that is why they carry such a large Waitlist so that they can serve more people.,311,,
1489,0.97,11746.201,11751.272,Thank you.,312,,
1490,0.97,11751.272,11765.487,"See no additional comments Councilmember Strauss, the rotary joint by Councilmember Morales, Councilmember Pedersen, and Councilmember Lewis with also Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Sawant joining you.",312,,

1493,0.97,11780.635,11786.708,I wonder if we should break here and start after a 2:00 break with all items Sdci and SPR related.,312,,

1495,0.97,11791.646,11795.049,This first item is actually an ose item.,313,,

1498,0.97,11819.04,11819.374,Okay.,315,,
1499,0.97,11819.374,11827.382,We will do this last item . We are on our last item on ose.,315,,
1500,0.97,11827.382,11835.089,Yes it is Sli Ose-006-A- 001.,316,,
1501,0.97,11835.089,11850.772,This proposed statement of legislative intent and request that ose consult with the urban forestry Commission to develop a plan to transfer all urban forestry functions into ose.,316,,
1502,0.97,11850.772,11902.056,There are nine departments that have a role in the city management of these efforts include maintaining trees in the public Right-Of-Way and it is the plan that should include the implementation and use for implementing the proposed reorganization and the response would be due to the committee by September 15.,316,,
1503,0.97,11902.056,11918.873,Thank you and I want to thank Councilmember Strauss for his leadership on the trees and for Cosponsoring this and maybe joining on.,317,,
1504,0.97,11918.873,11936.124,And the trees provide numerous benefits including the absorption to reduce the harmful runoff and Puget sound.,317,,
1505,0.97,11938.66,11941.195,And it has the proven health benefits and the bigger the tree the better.,317,,
1506,0.97,11941.195,11955.81,We take a long look at racial injustice issues and we know some communities of color are having fewer trees and have them removed were often.,317,,
1507,0.97,11955.81,11981.736,In 2000 and the city auditor determined the Factionalized management of trees and urban forestry issues was a problem in Seattle and for the past 11 years we have tried to make this approach and during that time I'm concerned we are seeing a decline in tree canopy and a loss of large trees and this gives the executive plenty of time to produce a basic plan for potential consolidation of the Seattle tree management under a single agency.,317,,
1508,0.97,11981.736,11994.449,It makes it very hard to track things and this would also have a preference from agency focused on the office of Sustainability and environment.,317,,
1509,0.97,11994.449,11994.849,Thank you.,317,,
1510,0.97,11994.849,11998.653,Thank you . Councilmember Strauss?,318,,

Thank you.,319,,
1513,0.97,12034.589,12040.661,A good example with my neighbor that I mentioned.,320,,
