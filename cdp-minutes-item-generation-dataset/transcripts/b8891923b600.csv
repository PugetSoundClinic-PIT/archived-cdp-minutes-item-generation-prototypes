52,0.97,363.763,383.549,"Since the Oig set out to not assign blame and our current policing--there remains as there did 21 years ago, 22 years ago after the WTO absolutely no incentive for cops to change behavior rooted from generations of culture.",9,,

62,0.97,433.366,444.744,A disproportionate amount of Council time is spent on--[Indiscernible] supporters of the bill made contradictory arguments.,11,,
63,0.97,444.744,451.584,Is this bill about human rights and police accountability and not about Israel?,11,,
64,0.97,451.584,456.255,Or is Israel an evil country committing these evil crimes?,11,,
65,0.97,456.255,464.03,If the bill targets Israel then it is discriminatory.,11,,
66,0.97,464.163,473.739,[Indiscernible] a number of callers claim the criticism does not lead to anti-Semitism but that is false.,11,,
67,0.97,473.739,487.987,Criticism of Israel is a trigger and cover for hate crimes Perpetrate against Jews.,11,,
68,0.97,487.987,500.433,Our City Council has been hijacked by an Extremist side logically agenda.,11,,
69,0.97,500.433,512.311,"Please get back to serving Seattle, table this motion, get rid of this bill and make Seattle a safe, inclusive and welcoming community for all.",11,,

80,0.97,580.613,583.382,And then showed significant gains from Psychedelic medicine.,13,,

82,0.97,590.356,595.861,Our city is experiencing a severe shortage of mental health service made ever more acute by Covid.,13,,
83,0.97,595.861,603.803,It does not make sense to out law medicines that have such strong restriction support.,13,,

116,0.97,818.217,838.437,My parents were in their 90S at the end of their lives and suffering from pain and depression when medical marijuana was legalized in Colorado.,19,,
117,0.97,838.437,848.581,Before offering it to them Hi to try it myself and was blown away by the effects.,19,,
118,0.97,848.581,863.362,It made me furious at the lives ruined and the suffering and deaths that didn't need to happen if we learned about these benefits sooner instead of not supporting research for a positive effect.,19,,
119,0.97,863.362,864.296,Only supporting research for negative effect.,19,,
120,0.97,864.296,875.04,So now Seattle is in the position to lead by being an early Adopter of Decriminalizing Psychedelic plants.,19,,
121,0.97,875.04,893.492,The important issue is Decriminalize plants that grows abundantly in our area in a way that enables the people that need them to access them and safely along with the--affordable and accessible health care.,19,,

232,0.97,1576.207,1580.312,"Good morning, thank you Madam chair, Council President Gonzalez and committee members.",43,,
233,0.97,1580.312,1583.081,We appreciate the opportunity to speak with you this morning.,43,,
234,0.97,1583.081,1588.553,I think most of you have had the opportunity to hear about the process as its been developed.,43,,
235,0.97,1588.553,1595.994,I will just gave brief over view so we can maximize the time we have to talk to the guests that are with me today.,43,,
236,0.97,1595.994,1597.729,And ask questions about the findings.,43,,
237,0.97,1597.729,1603.134,So if you could advance to the next slide.,43,,
238,0.97,1603.134,1608.606,Just very briefly what it is is a review of a sentinel event.,43,,
239,0.97,1608.606,1610.041,Sentinel event being really key here.,43,,
240,0.97,1610.041,1636.735,"It is a--something that happens that has tragic or unwanted consequences and so it is a signal there is something went wrong with individual folks but there are deeper systemic issues that need to be analyzed so you can more upstream from the problem, fix those things to prevent a similar tragic occur Frens happening in the future.",43,,
241,0.97,1636.735,1642.173,Generally in sentinel event types of review processes the event really is self identified.,43,,
242,0.97,1642.173,1661.826,It has been used a quite a bit in the industry where you have a single tragic event like a plane crash or death on the operating table and so the event is identified and broken down and analyzed.,43,,
243,0.97,1661.826,1671.469,Here last summer we had a rolling series of tragic events daily for quite an extended period of time.,43,,
244,0.97,1671.469,1689.988,Part of the work was identifying which sentinel events would be reviewed by a review panel and so in under taking that work we had to really divide it and that--that necessity setting all Planninggroup that would help us identify those events.,43,,
245,0.97,1689.988,1691.322,I'm getting ahead of myself.,43,,
246,0.97,1691.322,1703.068,This was unique because it is kind of the first instance in my knowledge where the events weren't identified but you had to do some additional work.,43,,
247,0.97,1703.068,1707.539,"If you want to advance to the next slide, please.",43,,
248,0.97,1707.539,1733.565,We also really wanted to approach this from focus on community perspectives and making sure we were addressing community concerns and a core thing that all of us and the folks who agreed to work on the panel were really concerned about was making sure we had recommendations that would be Implementful.,44,,
249,0.97,1733.565,1737.969,"Nobody wanted to engage in this really, really hard work for nothing.",44,,
250,0.97,1737.969,1743.908,So we Anted to come out of this with something Impactful.,44,,
251,0.97,1743.908,1746.411,"If you could advance the slide, please.",44,,
252,0.97,1746.411,1758.656,So just kind of laying it out in terms of our stages in initial planning we started reaching out to make this community center to community partners.,44,,
253,0.97,1758.656,1765.497,We engaged with consultants who had some expertise that our small office did not have in community engagement.,44,,
254,0.97,1765.497,1777.375,We consulted with the community police Commission and other stake holders to get a sense of what the universe of engagement should look like for us.,44,,
255,0.97,1777.375,1777.942,We started broadly.,44,,
256,0.97,1777.942,1788.419,We sent out communications to I think over 100 organizations and individuals inviting conversations about what this looks like.,44,,
257,0.97,1788.419,1808.273,It is really--it is not fair for people who might be sitting on a panel like this to be the representative of their particular communities and so what we were trying to do was get a broad range of lived experiences from people who were most impacted by police violence.,44,,
258,0.97,1808.273,1832.931,We tried to center black voice in the panel and to make sure that we were--not just from the protest but more broadly for the history of police violence we were reaching out and trying to get folks on the panel who had a range of experiences in and impact the community.,44,,
259,0.97,1832.931,1845.176,"So had many conversations with people out in community who some were interested not process, some couldn't commit, some just didn't think this was the table they wanted to sit at.",44,,
260,0.97,1845.176,1857.655,So through a lot of conversations with people and people saying this sounds really interesting and--but it doesn't sound like work we can do but you should talk to this other person.,44,,
261,0.97,1857.655,1863.061,We had a lot of--it spread and the conversations spread.,44,,
262,0.97,1863.061,1888.62,Through that we decided we would like community self identify and have people filter to us from these conversations who were interested in coming together and doing some really difficult work with the police Department to help them figure out what went wrong last summer and to implement fixes to keep that from ever happening again.,44,,
263,0.97,1888.62,1894.592,As I mentioned we had two segments of people working on this.,44,,
264,0.97,1894.592,1908.973,"The planning group were--very helpful in just deciding and helping us frame the project and figure out what it needed to look like, who we should reach out to and identifying panel members as well as events.",44,,
265,0.97,1908.973,1917.615,They were and continue to be very helpful.,44,,
266,0.97,1917.615,1922.02,"Then panelists include community folks, law enforcement, individuals and--I think that is important.",44,,
267,0.97,1922.02,1933.364,At the end of the day this report is for SPD to take to heart and to make those changes to keep this from happening again.,44,,
268,0.97,1933.364,1951.049,"So buying from SPD, their participation and making sure we are understanding what happened and that the things we were recommending are in fact possible and Implementable was critical to what I feel is the success of this project.",44,,
269,0.97,1951.049,1951.516,At this point --,44,,
270,0.97,1951.516,1952.15,Inspector General?,45,,
271,0.97,1952.15,1952.65,Yes.,46,,
272,0.97,1952.65,1974.472,"Real quickly because it was question or statement in Puck Lek comment, the selection of the panelists, that was done as I understand it by sort of word of mouth recruitment or was there an open call for people to apply to be panelists?",47,,
273,0.97,1974.472,1981.579,There was not an open call because we were really targeting impacted communities in our initial outreach.,48,,
274,0.97,1981.579,1998.763,"We were going to black led organizations, to organizations that work with youth, organizations that work with populations like Lgbtqia, homeless, people who are impacted by mental illness.",48,,
275,0.97,1998.763,2012.577,It Reely was targeted to impacted communities and talking with folks in those--in those areas to identify voices that would best bring that kind of perspective to the table.,48,,
276,0.97,2012.577,2014.879,So there was no open call.,48,,
277,0.97,2014.879,2025.123,It was targeted and then criteria for panel membership was established by the planning group which had community representatives and other stake holders there.,48,,
278,0.97,2025.123,2039.904,"So really what the group was looking for in terms of panel membership, what kinds of perspectives they thought were important to be included here and Vetting of panel members was done by the planning group.",48,,
279,0.97,2039.904,2040.872,Not simply by Oig.,48,,
280,0.97,2040.872,2041.272,Thank you.,48,,
281,0.97,2041.272,2043.574,I hope that is responsive to your question.,48,,
282,0.97,2043.574,2046.31,I would like to throw it open.,48,,
283,0.97,2046.31,2055.052,Donna Moodie if you have anythin to add to maybe your experience in this part of the process?,48,,
284,0.97,2055.052,2091.022,I would say having been on the panel as well as the planning group that probably the thing that I most noticed when I was first Aproechd by Lisa judge was that--I was skeptical and I--basically mentioned that I didn't think that--behavior of the police Department during protests was something that I wanted to kind of cop done or analyze and say well--this went rye but leave lets move on.,49,,
285,0.97,2091.022,2099.997,"After a conversation with Lisa and seeing where her perspective was coming from and the process, I thought I would guy give--give it a try.",49,,
286,0.97,2099.997,2142.807,"Once I went to my first panel even though it was hard to visually and repeatedly look at incident in really close Analytical and very scientific way, I came away just realizing that it was really beneficial to give time and dedication and also just a focus to the incidents themselves and kind of remove in some ways a little bit of emotion and really look at things and in not like the world I would like to see but look at that in this is what happened, what could we do differently to make that exact incident not happen again.",49,,
287,0.97,2142.807,2150.748,In that approach t science of it intrigued me and made my participation kind of heart felt.,49,,
288,0.97,2150.748,2167.798,"I will say in reference to my colleagues on the panel, there were a lot of people that would immediately stop the conversation in the midst of it and say you over looking historic and systemic racism that we see in this situation.",49,,
289,0.97,2167.798,2174.338,Like it is not just that someone was arrested for moving the crowd forward or interfering with the police.,49,,
290,0.97,2174.338,2184.982,"It is that if you block and Atten event like that, your arrest will have much different impact on your life than that of some other protesters.",49,,
291,0.97,2184.982,2191.322,So we were often and often kind of keeping that the center of how we looked at things.,49,,
292,0.97,2191.322,2199.33,I think it was in a lot of ways a really true representation of community.,49,,
293,0.97,2199.33,2208.406,We could always have more people but we had a really diverse representation from our panel.,49,,
294,0.97,2208.406,2208.94,"Thank you, Donna.",50,,
295,0.97,2208.94,2209.307,Appreciate that.,50,,
296,0.97,2209.307,2217.315,"If you could move to the next slide, please.",50,,
297,0.97,2217.315,2229.794,So obviously our main goal from here would be establish some side goal along the way in terms of reconciliation and getting to some healing.,50,,
298,0.97,2229.794,2261.359,What we were aiming to do was form--[Indiscernible] as we mentioned before Oig and participants alike didn't want to engage in a process and devote ourselves to something where there weren't going to be--where there wasn't going to be a likelihood for a meaningful change to come out of this so we had to commit to that to establishing things that would lead to meaningful Changement we were committed to having diverse panel experiences.,50,,
299,0.97,2261.359,2269.333,Not necessarily of community representatives but of diversity of opinion but experience all of those things.,50,,
300,0.97,2269.333,2285.85,So the--one of the biggest hurdles was communication of bringing people who had really divergent and sometimes violently conflict ideas together to have real conversations with each other.,50,,
301,0.97,2285.85,2310.007,"So early on when we were planning the process we decided peace making was probably going to be the--the most Impactful way we could get people with really divergent feelings in a room to talk, hear one another, respect one another and have a supportive environment so that we could have those conversations.",50,,
302,0.97,2310.007,2312.176,So we decided to use the peace making process.,50,,
303,0.97,2312.176,2314.245,If you could advance to the next slide.,50,,
304,0.97,2314.245,2324.322,I will give Saroeum a chance to talk about peace making and what we did here with his experiences.,50,,
305,0.97,2324.322,2324.989,"So, Yeah.",50,,
306,0.97,2324.989,2325.956,"Saroeum, are you with us?",50,,
307,0.97,2325.956,2328.659,You want to talk about peace making?,50,,
308,0.97,2328.659,2334.298,"Yes, I am, Lis Lisa, thank you so much.",51,,
309,0.97,2334.298,2335.399,"First of all, thank you.",51,,
310,0.97,2335.399,2351.982,It has ban privilege and an honor to work John Holloway members on the panel.,51,,
311,0.97,2351.982,2389.787,"To me since we don't have a lot of time I will spend a few minutes to talk about why peace making is so--[Indiscernible] because of the distrust between community and SPD and the trauma have been caused, it is hard to build trust and create a space where people can listen to one another because of their Harms and pain and the hurt that has been happening for hundreds of years.",51,,
312,0.97,2389.787,2398.028,So one of the things in order to build trust is the peace making circle promote peace and reconciliation.,51,,
313,0.97,2398.028,2402.633,The DIS trust means somewhere along the line people were feeling hurt.,51,,
314,0.97,2402.633,2406.57,It is tapping into the emotional capacity.,51,,
315,0.97,2406.57,2413.544,So it is good the use a mental and intellectual to try to problem solve what is mental aspects of it.,51,,
316,0.97,2413.544,2421.685,It is really difficult to build safety and healthy environment where people can actually really speak to the truth and show their emotions.,51,,
317,0.97,2421.685,2428.759,"So that is why peace making process is very unique, innovative process when it comes to listening.",51,,
318,0.97,2428.759,2433.531,I think there is a lot of people who have a lot of things they want to share.,51,,
319,0.97,2433.531,2447.745,Often times we create a space with people are more blaming and Shaming each other instead of listening.,51,,
320,0.97,2447.745,2455.486,Healing sometimes start with those significant small step.,51,,
321,0.97,2455.486,2462.526,Peace making circle also is a value based approach.,51,,
322,0.97,2462.526,2473.337,"Speaking to what is our values and how do we lead and speak from the value we say who we are so we can learn how to see each other as human beings, as valuable assets to our community.",51,,
323,0.97,2473.337,2482.98,"And to heal or make amend from the distrust we have been straining from one another for many, many years.",51,,
324,0.97,2482.98,2486.05,I wanted to share the trust peace.,51,,
325,0.97,2486.05,2490.387,I think that it is easy to build trust of people you find intrigued.,51,,
326,0.97,2490.387,2496.861,It is harder to build trust where people felt like there is harm being done for you.,51,,
327,0.97,2496.861,2504.702,Especially in the black community and also in other communities like myself.,51,,
328,0.97,2504.702,2510.674,I grew Upton Street involved in the system and have dealt throughout my life with law enforcement.,51,,
329,0.97,2510.674,2521.218,So to me peace making healing is a great way to go and it allows us to see each other as humans and build trust with one another.,51,,
330,0.97,2521.218,2522.653,We need build the community.,51,,
331,0.97,2522.653,2531.795,"That is a more diverse community, equitable and Inclues--inclusive to everyone.",51,,
332,0.97,2531.795,2536.233,So why trust is so important because it allows people to feel safe together.,51,,
333,0.97,2536.233,2541.639,When we don't feel safe we put our defensive up.,51,,
334,0.97,2541.639,2557.454,When we feel safe people feel like they can put their guard down and be able to take things less personal and hearing each other and help each other heal from whatever trauma.,51,,
335,0.97,2557.454,2559.223,Why peace making circle?,51,,
336,0.97,2559.223,2560.124,Because of trust.,51,,
337,0.97,2560.124,2565.195,I think more importantly trust means collaboration and partnership.,51,,
338,0.97,2565.195,2581.812,Obviously this distrust to solve this problem in our community between police and the community require all of us to bring our best self to the engagement because young people are family in our community and really important and sometime the system is not part of the community.,51,,
339,0.97,2581.812,2584.281,What is why trust is really ill poor want.,51,,
340,0.97,2584.281,2597.962,It has been such an honor to have a lot of difficult challenging conversations but do it in a way we can listen to one another and be honest and be sincere and not taking things personal.,51,,
341,0.97,2597.962,2599.063,It isn't about us.,51,,
342,0.97,2599.063,2609.039,It is about us getting together to find whatever we can work through so we can collaborate and figure tout best solution for people and our families because they deserve more from all of us.,51,,
343,0.97,2609.039,2624.154,"It has been a privilege to work with the panel, Oig and John and contribute to connect us as humans so we remember that we are part of the human species before our skin color, before our language, our culture.",51,,
344,0.97,2624.154,2635.132,So that we are all a human family and existing on planet earth together without having to view that conflict as necessary.,51,,
345,0.97,2635.132,2643.507,In fact healing peace making and trust allow us to live together in harmony together as human beings and human species.,51,,
346,0.97,2643.507,2644.708,That was my thoughts.,51,,
347,0.97,2644.708,2646.443,I've been doing this work for over two decades.,51,,
348,0.97,2646.443,2654.284,"A lot of my work is mainly dealing with the program, healing family and communities.",51,,
349,0.97,2654.284,2660.29,It is a way to move forward.,51,,
350,0.97,2660.29,2672.936,This is some of the things I've been privileged to work with people who want to change but don't know thousand do it.,51,,
351,0.97,2672.936,2684.148,Every time we get together we are normally Shaming each other and that is not good way to build a healthy community in my opinion and our young people and community deserve more than.,51,,
352,0.97,2684.148,2685.249,It has been an honor.,51,,
353,0.97,2685.249,2694.158,Thank you everyone for allowing me to be here.,51,,
354,0.97,2694.158,2695.292,"Thank you, Saroeum.",52,,
355,0.97,2695.292,2697.127,Always an honor to hear you speak.,52,,
356,0.97,2697.127,2701.398,It has been a privilege to work with you as well.,52,,
357,0.97,2701.398,2717.081,I've become a very big believer in it as positive way to problem solve between community and government and to resolve conflict.,52,,
358,0.97,2717.081,2720.25,I've become a big believer.,52,,
359,0.97,2720.25,2721.385,Thank you very much.,52,,
360,0.97,2721.385,2722.152,Thank you.,53,,
361,0.97,2722.152,2722.553,All right.,54,,
362,0.97,2722.553,2724.588,"If you want to move to the next slide, please.",54,,
363,0.97,2724.588,2730.828,Just a little bit about how we came to identify the events we did.,54,,
364,0.97,2730.828,2740.437,We looked at a lot of data and when you aggregate it you can see in the top of the slide there is what looks like little waves.,54,,
365,0.97,2740.437,2749.413,"So there were a lot of spikes on certain days with uses and force, arrests.",54,,
366,0.97,2749.413,2753.417,Those days became the significant days that turned into waves for us.,54,,
367,0.97,2753.417,2756.053,"You can get back, please, one slide.",54,,
368,0.97,2756.053,2760.057,"When we looked at that--no, go to the next slide, please.",54,,
369,0.97,2760.057,2760.39,There you go.,54,,
370,0.97,2760.39,2771.535,So we looked at these things and it was very clear they sort of shook out in five distinct Aves of activity.,54,,
371,0.97,2771.535,2786.083,So the report that we are discussing today is the wave one report that mostly encompass the downtown protests.,54,,
372,0.97,2786.083,2804.067,You can see we have three other steps here.,54,,
373,0.97,2804.067,2826.323,"After that we had some significant incidents in July, July 25th being probably the one that Springs most to folks minds and then some incident in September followed by wave five which was really after SPD had significantly changed its approach to these things.",54,,
374,0.97,2826.323,2835.632,"So if you go to the next one, specifically to wave one here are some of the things we looked at in aggregating data.",54,,
375,0.97,2835.632,2839.836,"We looked at uses of force, less lethal weapons used.",54,,
376,0.97,2839.836,2845.209,But using looking at reports of that.,54,,
377,0.97,2845.209,2845.642,Looking at arrests.,54,,
378,0.97,2845.642,2848.812,Number of officer injuries.,54,,
379,0.97,2848.812,2851.582,Complaints that came into OPA.,54,,
380,0.97,2851.582,2853.05,"Claims, lawsuits and the like.",54,,
381,0.97,2853.05,2866.463,We scoured social media for certain Keywords and so we kind of Aggregated this information and--[Indiscernible] any questions before we move on?,54,,
382,0.97,2866.463,2879.476,So in taking this information we--we let our planning group look through it and the planning group identified some specific incident the panel would review.,54,,
383,0.97,2879.476,2894.057,We can talk about those a little bit more in depth but when the panel started meeting it was very clear that some incidents had happened right at the very beginning of these protests on May 29th in the International district.,54,,
384,0.97,2894.057,2908.705,It was really I think important for the panel--from the panel's perspective to look at those events and acknowledge what had happened to start setting the stage for what occurred over the weeks and months to come.,54,,
385,0.97,2908.705,2912.709,That was some property damage that occurred in the International district on May 29th.,54,,
386,0.97,2912.709,2923.02,"So while that was not an event that was identified by the planning group, it was something that the planning group did break down.",54,,
387,0.97,2923.02,2926.823,You will see it described in some detail in the report.,54,,
388,0.97,2926.823,2935.132,So here the incidents that were reviewed were that property damage I described on May 30th.,54,,
389,0.97,2935.132,2935.832,The child being pepper sprayed.,54,,
390,0.97,2935.832,2946.677,The cars being set on fire in the West Lake area and looting happening.,54,,
391,0.97,2946.677,2960.257,The officer--some Video footage of an officer making arrests outside of T-Mobile the night of May 30th putting his knee on the neck of some individuals.,54,,
392,0.97,2960.257,2969.299,An officer altercation that happened the next day and then pink umbrella incident on June 1ST.,54,,
393,0.97,2969.299,2973.67,What I will do now is give --,54,,
394,0.97,2973.67,2974.638,Quick.,55,,
395,0.97,2974.638,2976.106,Before you move on.,55,,
396,0.97,2976.106,3002.299,"So I heard you say that--that the panel identified--sorry the planning group recommended to the panel the wave 1 incidents but in the case of the organized property damage in the Cid that was not identified, initially and so it was the--panel who said planning group we need to add this.",55,,
397,0.97,3002.299,3003.2,Based on what?,55,,
398,0.97,3003.2,3018.815,Was that based on numbers of complaints or based on their understanding of because of their lived experiences their understanding of the importance of that event on May 29th?,55,,
399,0.97,3018.815,3022.386,I think it is a combination of those things.,56,,
400,0.97,3022.386,3043.306,Also we had throughout this process we have invited folks to come and talk to the panel who have particular experiences and in this I think from this particular incident we had a guest come and talk about their experiences throughout the series of protests.,56,,
401,0.97,3043.306,3046.843,The guests spoke a lot about incidents that happened on the 29th.,56,,
402,0.97,3046.843,3069.399,"So the pan hell a lot of opportunity to ask questions about that, to then get data about that incident and I think it had implications for acknowledging the role that race plays in all of these events and the perceptions of Leng legitimacy.",56,,
403,0.97,3069.399,3079.576,It was something the panel felt they needed to call out and break down.,56,,
404,0.97,3079.576,3079.91,Thank you.,57,,
405,0.97,3079.91,3080.21,Sure.,58,,
406,0.97,3080.21,3096.66,"So, in--and just--for your information, we Atd Aggregated a lot of potential incidents and then the planning group ranked them in terms of what they felt were priorities and importance and what would be the most Impactful for changes to SPD.",58,,
407,0.97,3096.66,3104.768,That is how those incidents were picked from the larger set of potentially Reviewable incidents.,58,,
408,0.97,3104.768,3110.44,If you will go to the serve process slide.,58,,
409,0.97,3110.44,3120.984,When the panel was analyzing incidents we were looking at particular categories of--things that might have contributed to those negative events happening.,58,,
410,0.97,3120.984,3136.032,"So I think professor if you want to just give us brief run down about what we were looking for and what continue bought a factors mean and their role in this process, that would be great.",58,,
411,0.97,3136.032,3136.266,Sure.,59,,
412,0.97,3136.266,3136.9,Thank you to having me.,59,,
413,0.97,3136.9,3140.57,Thanks for letting me participate in this process.,59,,
414,0.97,3140.57,3141.104,It was a real pleasure.,59,,
415,0.97,3141.104,3169.833,I'm really impressed with the work you and the team did and just the willing Ness to use this process to look at--[Indiscernible] a number of open comments that were made refer to the need of police accountability.,59,,
416,0.97,3169.833,3187.951,I couldn't agree with that statement more and my feeling is that review actually adds a new kind of accountability to the existing administrative reviews and OPA and all of the other things going on.,59,,
417,0.97,3187.951,3206.236,What we are missing is sometimes the accountability of our existing governmental organizations to improve overtime.,59,,
418,0.97,3206.236,3233.597,To accept the roles they played in these events and to make changes so that their role improves and we are putting our--we are putting everybody in a position where they are more likely to Setten succeed and one of the great things about this process is we had community voices helping us to understand what success would look like and how things might look differently from a community perspective to aid us in that.,59,,
419,0.97,3233.597,3239.669,"What we did was we was took the events that had been identified, looked at them in great day.",59,,
420,0.97,3239.669,3243.74,The Mayor and her data team gave us tremendous amount of information about the facts.,59,,
421,0.97,3243.74,3247.344,What happened at what time in what Ord order.,59,,
422,0.97,3247.344,3251.314,Then we worked backwards from that asking why these events happened.,59,,
423,0.97,3251.314,3262.359,There is a technique that is use in this called the five Whys.,59,,
424,0.97,3262.359,3264.26,You ask why backwards five times.,59,,
425,0.97,3264.26,3284.447,What you often find is these continue bought a factor categories each come together in ways that were unexpected and unintended to result in these Nel sentinel E sentinel events.,59,,
426,0.97,3284.447,3297.16,"We tried to see all of the different factors, some of which were Protester driven, some of which were police driven, some of which were environmentally driven.",59,,
427,0.97,3297.16,3305.802,All of those things coming together to lead to a situation that nobody wants to see which is a situation in which a child gets pepper sprayed.,59,,
428,0.97,3305.802,3317.914,We try to then come up with recommendations that were Implementable by SPD because at the end of the day it is SPD's behavior we are trying to change.,59,,
429,0.97,3317.914,3319.949,That would have prevented that from occurring.,59,,
430,0.97,3319.949,3320.55,They come in these categories.,59,,
431,0.97,3320.55,3327.791,The Reck recommendations are in the report.,59,,
432,0.97,3327.791,3335.932,That is the process we went through.,59,,
433,0.97,3335.932,3348.478,"Larger systemic review and the sort of emotional weight that our communities of color have had to carry because of the history of interactions they have had with government, with police really for the history of our country and probably longer than that.",59,,
434,0.97,3348.478,3362.559,So trying to keep these perspectives in mind while we were doing that so the recommendations we have would prevent in the next protest the Escalations we saw in these.,59,,
435,0.97,3362.559,3366.896,Thanks.,60,,
436,0.97,3366.896,3380.11,"So as just on the last slide as you can see we are really breaking it down into things like communication, culture leadership, operational supervision, tactics, policies and providers, equipment, environment and others.",60,,
437,0.97,3380.11,3385.014,It--when you read the report you will see these things called Wishbone diagrams.,60,,
438,0.97,3385.014,3387.384,There is another word more technical for it.,60,,
439,0.97,3387.384,3395.291,It was the things the panel was identifying that fit into those broad categories that were turned into recommendations.,60,,
440,0.97,3395.291,3401.598,That leads us to the group ultimately made 54 recommendations.,60,,
441,0.97,3401.598,3405.869,They really broadly shake out this into about five categories here.,60,,
442,0.97,3405.869,3409.506,The first one I think is super important.,60,,
443,0.97,3409.506,3431.795,So one of the things that was very apparent with community includes is we would be talking about an instance where the police officers felt like they were operating within existing policies and they were operating within the frame work of existing law and so they have viewed their actions as legitimate.,60,,
444,0.97,3431.795,3445.875,"When you look at it from a community perspective, often the community's perception of that legitimacy was far different.",60,,
445,0.97,3445.875,3452.215,We identified two different types of legitimacy.,60,,
446,0.97,3452.215,3462.759,We identified a pretty big gap.,60,,
447,0.97,3462.759,3473.403,Many of these recommendations go to trying to get SPD to bring their actions more into alignment with what community perceives as legitimate.,60,,
448,0.97,3473.403,3482.645,If you talk about the potentials for changing philosophy and culture behind this report is a really critical area that we talk about.,60,,
449,0.97,3482.645,3505.134,The other one is--that is a Fils Solvical and cultural suggestion and category is moving away from a mindset that is common in policing with first amendment activity of treating these as vents that should be managed and controlled versus events that should be facilitated and done so in a way that everybody stays safe.,60,,
450,0.97,3505.134,3511.407,So another big critical recommendation from my perspective is a shift in that mindset.,60,,
451,0.97,3511.407,3518.014,"We see things we have already identified from Oig's work last summer, many OPA identify this.",60,,
452,0.97,3518.014,3543.239,"I think SPD has also come to some similar inclusions that communication and community engagement are really key in making sure █That SPD is acting with the best information they have, the community has the information they need to make decisions about how--about--what is going on at protests.",60,,
453,0.97,3543.239,3549.646,Everybody is communicating with one another and understanding that--what is going on.,60,,
454,0.97,3549.646,3559.889,We saw a lot of misunderstanding as the basis for many things that went wrong in the events that we analyzed so that is really critical.,60,,
455,0.97,3559.889,3563.993,"Tactics, equipment and another component officer wellness and training.",60,,
456,0.97,3563.993,3583.446,"Developing staffing models that don't have officers standing out, ebb--engaging in confrontational situations for hours on end.",60,,
457,0.97,3583.446,3593.99,Just getting officers some resources so they are able to show up with their better selves when they are staffing.,60,,
458,0.97,3593.99,3635.465,"Judge, on the broad category of officer wellness and training, it has been suggested that another way to--address officer wellness and recognizing the impacts of long shifts and prolonged hostile environments on officer wellness behave Wror is to also identify some of the tactical decisions not that individual officers make but that are made by the institution of the police Department that lead to long shifts, that lead to hostile engagement.",61,,
459,0.97,3635.465,3639.402,So I don't think it is an either or thing.,61,,
460,0.97,3639.402,3669.866,I think it is absolutely legitimate to tend to the wellness need of individual officers when the institution is making decisions that have impacts on their--their staffing and the--engagements but I also think it is important to recognize the role that the institution plays in degrading the wellness of officers out there in the field.,61,,
461,0.97,3669.866,3671.467,I completely agree.,62,,
462,0.97,3671.467,3672.568,Many of these are interrelated concepts.,62,,
463,0.97,3672.568,3680.41,"I think you are right, at the end of the day the individual officer should not be put in those kinds of situations.",62,,
464,0.97,3680.41,3692.321,It really is an organizational obligation to make sure that that is not happening and that there are resources to deal with the officer's fatigue and trauma.,62,,
465,0.97,3692.321,3692.555,Thanks.,62,,
466,0.97,3692.555,3695.358,So that is the end of the presentation.,62,,
467,0.97,3695.358,3708.137,There is time if you want to talk to any of the panelists or get other information from Oig.,62,,
468,0.97,3708.137,3717.78,I do have one other question that was raised by a member of the public.,63,,
469,0.97,3717.78,3724.52,Somebody who is a--police reform advocate that I really respect.,63,,
470,0.97,3724.52,3747.81,I just wanted to share this--as I understand this particular perspective and invite you to clarify because I don't think the way that it being received is the intended--the intended message.,63,,
471,0.97,3747.81,3752.515,That relates to specifically the--impacts or the equipment recommendation.,63,,
472,0.97,3752.515,3759.422,I suppose it could also be a tactic recommendation.,63,,
473,0.97,3759.422,3813.442,"But specifically the recommendation that says that--if there is a sufficient supply of pepper spray, that will help mitigate the likelihood that tear gas is used and the response to that particular recommendation was received as if it is a sort of--a--sort of a training Module for SPD, how to create the circumstances that would allow them to use tear gas.",63,,
474,0.97,3813.442,3819.282,Ie just don't have enough pepper spray and then you will be justified in using tear gas.,63,,
475,0.97,3819.282,3824.153,I don't think it would be intended to be received that way.,63,,
476,0.97,3824.153,3835.031,If--but if you have an opportunity to respond to that.,63,,
477,0.97,3835.031,3835.865,Yes.,63,,
478,0.97,3835.865,3853.516,Tear gas should only ever be used as a last resort when you are facing potentially--a lot of potential violence and in an area that is not residential.,63,,
479,0.97,3853.516,3865.595,The small particular nature of gas just in my opinion makes it entirely unsuitable for use in a neighborhood or any place where people live.,63,,
480,0.97,3865.595,3880.876,"So--in--government facility that is being over run by being stormed by armed assailants, something like a January 6th event, do you want to have tools like tear gas on hand?",63,,
481,0.97,3880.876,3885.548,I believe the answer to that is yes.,63,,
482,0.97,3885.548,3892.822,"In these circumstances, like the protests last summer, I would hope the recommendations that come out of this lead to no OC spray being used.",63,,
483,0.97,3892.822,3896.292,That I think is the end goal for us.,63,,
484,0.97,3896.292,3918.214,It is not to create circumstances where--their scenarios where tear gas is used for my--part I believe Taes gas is a tool of last resort when you are facing extreme violence and there is no potential for collateral harm to innocent people who are trying to get away from it just living their lives in their own homes.,63,,
485,0.97,3918.214,3930.359,"I don't know if that is su fish Yebt clarification but Yeah, certainly didn't mean to imply that.",63,,
486,0.97,3930.359,3935.064,Thank you very much.,64,,
487,0.97,3935.064,3935.798,Do my colleagues have any questions?,64,,
488,0.97,3936.098,3946.442,Thank you very much.,65,,
489,0.97,3947.877,3948.544,Do my colleagues have any questions?,65,,
490,0.97,3948.844,3975.304,Just want to say thanks to all of the community panelists for participating and lending their time and look forward to just digging more into the details of these--recommendations to get the systems issue.,65,,
491,0.97,3975.304,3991.821,Ijust want to thank John in particular for sort of reminding U that the---- the purpose of this particular review is not necessarily if individual officer accountability but for on going review of the system that we do have in place.,65,,
492,0.97,3991.821,4005.301,I know there are people who have concerns about the system and a lot of skepticism and questions about the legitimacy and efficacy of the system.,65,,
493,0.97,4005.301,4042.338,I want to acknowledge that that those sentiments come from a real place of oppression and of exclusion and Silt our responsibility to not Legit Mise behavior we disagree with but change ourselves to evolve in a way that will produce accountability and prevent many of the things that--I know many of us--oppose see happening to members of our community last summer from happening again.,65,,
494,0.97,4042.338,4079.842,I appreciate the opportunity to engage in that level of a conversation while also acknowledging the--legitimacy questions and the skepticism that has been expressed by members of our community who have been negatively impacted is also very quite real and these two things can Co-Exist with each other at the same time and look forward to continuing to--to do the hard work to continue to challenge this system to do better.,65,,
495,0.97,4079.842,4081.41,"Thank you, Council President.",66,,
496,0.97,4081.41,4086.215,"Yes, I want to thank you as well, Council President Gonzalez.",67,,
497,0.97,4086.215,4099.628,I think it is really important that we not Marginalize those voices who have--questions about the efficacy of our accountability system.,67,,
498,0.97,4099.628,4145.274,"The--they are reflective of the experiences of our community and opportunities like the sentinel review is one such opportunity to hear more from those voices and--I trust that the--the system, the three legged civilian accountability system will continue to hear those voices, engage with those voices and work with all of us for continued reform and evolution of our accountability system.",67,,
499,0.97,4145.274,4145.774,There are no --,67,,
500,0.97,4145.774,4147.843,Can I say one final thing?,68,,
501,0.97,4147.843,4148.177,Absolutely.,69,,
502,0.97,4148.177,4151.914,I want to acknowledge this is a prototype process.,70,,
503,0.97,4151.914,4152.715,This didn't exist and Seattle.,70,,
504,0.97,4152.715,4162.858,This is the first time we have had any sort of review process that meaningfully incorporated community engagement so we are building it.,70,,
505,0.97,4162.858,4164.527,We are learning from it.,70,,
506,0.97,4164.527,4167.062,This isn't--this isn't the final product by any means.,70,,
507,0.97,4167.062,4177.84,We are always trying to learn and grow and improve this process so we start using something that involves community and other types of previews of SPD.,70,,
508,0.97,4177.84,4185.481,And just because I feel like I need to because this is--something I have heard from members of the public.,71,,
509,0.97,4185.481,4189.985,It is something I have read and something I personally experienced.,71,,
510,0.97,4189.985,4193.088,This is a prototype process as it relates to a sentinel review.,71,,
511,0.97,4193.088,4210.739,This is not the first time we have had a process that is led by members of the community to done do an engagement with the public around after action of the Seattle police Department.,71,,
512,0.97,4210.739,4213.409,That has absolutely--occurred before.,71,,
513,0.97,4213.409,4219.582,Very--very publicly after the WTO.,71,,
514,0.97,4219.582,4240.369,"Many, many months of several different panels that met publicly and heard from the public and came up with a lot of very--I think important recommendations and some of them--some of your recommendations are echoes of those recommendations at that time.",71,,
515,0.97,4240.369,4268.13,"Just as I have said before I think one of the things I would hope that we can do in future Iterations of the sentinel review process is think about ways for many members of the public to benefit from the experience of this process, this experience of healing where as the--old style WTO public review process might be Cathartic to some people.",71,,
516,0.97,4268.13,4269.798,It is not very healing.,71,,
517,0.97,4269.798,4285.981,This is a healing progress is for the people who participate but it doesn't necessarily offer the same sort of Cathartic outcome for a larger number of people.,71,,
518,0.97,4285.981,4297.76,So those are maybe--conflicting objectives but perhaps with future Iterations we can see if there is a way to do more of that.,71,,
519,0.97,4297.76,4297.993,Sure.,72,,
520,0.97,4297.993,4304.366,A news for other stake holder Ands partners to pick up the piece of the work.,72,,
521,0.97,4304.366,4306.335,Absolutely.,73,,
522,0.97,4306.335,4307.736,Thank you.,74,,
523,0.97,4307.736,4308.27,Thank you.,75,,
524,0.97,4308.27,4308.537,All right.,75,,
525,0.97,4308.537,4313.142,Really appreciate everybody taking their time to be here with us today.,75,,
526,0.97,4313.142,4329.825,Appreciate your many months of work and appreciate knowing that you will be continuing that work with the other sort of waves of protest activity yet to be reviewed.,75,,
527,0.97,4329.825,4335.03,So look forward to having you back,75,,
528,0.97,4335.03,4336.832,Thank you.,76,,
529,0.97,4336.832,4338.901,Okay.,77,,
530,0.97,4338.901,4345.14,Will the clerk please read in agenda item number two.,77,,
531,0.97,4345.14,4349.478,Seattle fire Department Rsji presentation.,78,,

533,0.97,4349.812,4354.249,I'm trying to see if we have the Presenters changing.,79,,
534,0.97,4354.249,4354.516,Fantastic.,79,,
535,0.97,4354.516,4372.835,"Like we did for the--this item, if we could--before we start delving into the presentation do some quick Inproductions--Infrom Troductions of who the Presenters are today.",79,,
536,0.97,4372.835,4376.538,We are lucky to have members of our change team.,80,,
537,0.97,4376.538,4381.677,We have Matthew Butler who will do most of the presenting this morning.,80,,
538,0.97,4381.677,4382.444,He will introduce himself.,80,,
539,0.97,4382.444,4388.45,We also have our two change team leads joining us for the presentation.,80,,
540,0.97,4388.45,4390.085,Captain Doug Johnson and Julie George.,80,,
541,0.97,4390.085,4411.774,So right now I will turn it over Maybe to Captain Johnson and Julie George to do a quick introduction and then Matthew if you will introduce yourself last and then you can start with the presentation.,80,,
542,0.97,4411.774,4412.908,Hello.,81,,
543,0.97,4412.908,4414.309,Good morning all.,81,,
544,0.97,4414.309,4414.777,Captain Johnson.,81,,
545,0.97,4414.777,4419.148,Julie George had to leave on a family emergency.,81,,
546,0.97,4419.148,4427.322,It will be me and officer Matthew Butler.,81,,
547,0.97,4427.322,4427.856,Thanks for having me.,81,,
548,0.97,4427.856,4431.527,"Matthew, go ahead.",81,,
549,0.97,4431.527,4433.195,I am Matthew Butler.,82,,
550,0.97,4433.195,4436.565,I'm the lead investigator here at Sfd.,82,,
551,0.97,4436.565,4444.506,My role is to be a primary over Seer of the change team and to do their work.,82,,
552,0.97,4444.506,4448.544,Prior I was a civil rights program manager in King County and practiced law before that.,82,,
553,0.97,4448.544,4459.855,I have been at s first degree for--Sfd for a year and a half and have really enjoyed working with this team.,82,,
554,0.97,4459.855,4469.998,They do a great job and I'm really honored to work with them.,82,,
555,0.97,4469.998,4478.073,With that being said I will try to share my screen to bring up my power point.,82,,
556,0.97,4478.073,4491.153,And I'm not sure if you can see it.,82,,
557,0.97,4491.153,4491.386,You can?,82,,
558,0.97,4491.386,4491.62,Yes.,83,,
559,0.97,4491.62,4491.954,"Okay, good.",84,,
560,0.97,4491.954,4502.931,"So, um, this is our opportunity to talk about our Sj work at Sfd.",84,,
561,0.97,4502.931,4503.832,We have a good team.,84,,
562,0.97,4503.832,4512.407,Win of the things that has been good is we have been able to note some really good accomplishments over the last year.,84,,
563,0.97,4512.407,4513.208,We completed four Rets.,84,,
564,0.97,4513.208,4518.38,We have engaged in some really good communication with our leadership.,84,,
565,0.97,4518.38,4521.083,We believe that has been improved.,84,,
566,0.97,4521.083,4531.693,There has been some note that Chris Santos has been apart of that as being part of our meetings and taking things back to leadership.,84,,
567,0.97,4531.693,4538.3,So I also want to recognize this moment.,84,,
568,0.97,4538.3,4556.785,We have done a lot of Department wide training with Dr. Hollands and a number of other methods to try to get cultural COMP fence and other concepts out to our membership as well as our civilian staff.,84,,
569,0.97,4556.785,4564.092,"We also engage in an updating of our hair, uniform policies to make them more culturally Progressive.",84,,
570,0.97,4564.092,4574.903,"In terms of the challenges we have had over the last year, obviously Covid-19 has been one of the big impacts on this work as well as it has been for everyone.",84,,
571,0.97,4574.903,4580.175,The ways in which Covid has had impacts are very Multi-Faceted.,84,,
572,0.97,4580.175,4581.71,I won't get into all of them.,84,,
573,0.97,4581.71,4586.415,It has been a challenge in terms of our meetings and moving the work forward.,84,,
574,0.97,4586.415,4598.961,"Uh, one of the things I think our--one of the biggest challenges is that we have had some employee incidents that have been impacted race and social justice adversely in our Department.",84,,
575,0.97,4598.961,4606.835,I want to note these things because of the fact that it is not to say we have any worst problems than anybody else.,84,,
576,0.97,4606.835,4619.247,We believe our Department is Reflectivity of the community at large and the large society but we had a situation where there was a noose found in a fire station that was a large investigation that was tone.,84,,
577,0.97,4619.247,4624.686,We were not able to come to a resolution of how that happened.,84,,
578,0.97,4624.686,4636.098,We also had a battalion chief that--was terminated because of the fact he made a joke about shooting protesters in a black lives matter rally.,84,,
579,0.97,4636.098,4659.154,"Again, these things are very, very difficult issues but we recognize them and note that again it is not we believe we have big problems but that dealing with these things, we try to recognize to recognize the way these things have happened and become better and more pliable in terms of how we deal with them.",84,,
580,0.97,4659.154,4679.608,"Other challenges are collecting data for research and--the ability to get numbers for comparison analysis for rats, often times that information is based upon individual employee information and it is not always available to the change team to do data.",84,,
581,0.97,4679.608,4690.619,So we tried to work to figure out a way in which we can get that information without compromising any employee specific information.,84,,
582,0.97,4690.619,4695.624,Other things that have been changes are implementation of solutions for our rats.,84,,
583,0.97,4695.624,4704.366,We can identify the problems but often times how we get to our solutions is something we got to just do a little bit of better job of.,84,,
584,0.97,4704.366,4709.771,Then communication and leadership is always something we want to try too improve.,84,,
585,0.97,4709.771,4726.054,"The remedies to these things are continued training, leadership engagement, accountability and the implementation of the rats with conversations with leadership and figuring out who takes ownership of the items identified in the rats.",84,,
586,0.97,4726.054,4738.333,"In terms of our rats, there are five that we want to recognize here today and point out.",84,,
587,0.97,4738.333,4748.043,They are the equitable and consistent standards for participation and hiring panels.,84,,
588,0.97,4748.043,4748.61,Recruit school retention.,84,,
589,0.97,4748.61,4748.91,Recruitment.,84,,
590,0.97,4748.91,4755.65,Our executive leadership Academy and our hair and uniform policy.,84,,
591,0.97,4755.65,4765.06,We were able to address these things trough RTS.,84,,
592,0.97,4765.06,4772.334,"Regarding the participation hiring panels, so the past policy for the panels had unintended negative consequences.",84,,
593,0.97,4772.334,4792.754,"The reason for that is that in an organization that does not have a broad base of people of color and women, it is hard to find people to participate in recruiting efforts as well as in--hiring Pab Els.",84,,
594,0.97,4792.754,4809.271,So the prior policy would not allow people to do both because there was a feeling it created a conflict of interest where if someone who was engaged in recruiting was out talking to someone and ended up on their hiring panel would be some sort of conflict.,84,,
595,0.97,4809.271,4822.784,But what happens in terms of that particular policy is the negative consequences it deprives the--[Indiscernible] from having diverse panels.,84,,
596,0.97,4822.784,4831.226,So this dual roles idea and dual participation in recruit is no locker a conflict of interest.,84,,
597,0.97,4831.226,4835.964,It does not violate any close personal relationship that existed before.,84,,
598,0.97,4835.964,4849.144,So the outcome is that women and people of color do not have to choose between participation and recruitment or on hiring panels.,84,,
599,0.97,4849.144,4850.178,They can do both.,84,,
600,0.97,4850.178,4853.548,Recruit school retention is one of the next rats we did.,84,,
601,0.97,4853.548,4855.417,This is a big one.,84,,
602,0.97,4855.417,4860.689,What we know is that competition to be a firefighter is very fierce.,84,,
603,0.97,4860.689,4862.123,A lot of people apply.,84,,
604,0.97,4862.123,4870.332,Hundreds of people will apply for positions and we get down to rate cute class of only 30 to 40.,84,,
605,0.97,4870.332,4879.674,"So once we have people in recruit school, they have gone through a lot to get to that point where they are one of 30 or 40 people.",84,,
606,0.97,4879.674,4905.033,What we want to do is everything we can to make sure they don't somehow get removed from graduating or removed from the process and not make it to graduation because of any sort of bias or processes we can identify that are not based upon their ability to do the essential functions of the fire fighting mission.,84,,
607,0.97,4905.033,4911.673,"So there has been a lot more training in terms of implicit bias, training of recruit instructors.",84,,
608,0.97,4911.673,4913.541,I personally do some of that training.,84,,
609,0.97,4913.541,4928.123,What we want to do is make the recruiting structures very aware of things that maybe issues that are not based upon the skills and abilities of the people in recruit school.,84,,
610,0.97,4928.123,4940.502,"So the outcome of this particular Ret is that there is greater scrutiny regarding racial equity impacts, regarding people of color and women in recruit school.",84,,
611,0.97,4940.502,4966.194,"Given how difficult it is when you have hundreds of people and you are down that 30 or 40, we want to do everything we can do to make sure there are no things that are inequitable in the moving of recruits from the start of recruit school to graduation.",84,,
612,0.97,4966.194,4976.638,What do we know about the Dem Graphics of an applicant pool as compared to the 30 to 40 recruit class pool?,85,,
613,0.97,4976.638,4982.344,The demographics in that pool.,85,,
614,0.97,4982.344,4983.111,How do the demographics compare?,85,,
615,0.97,4983.111,4984.245,I don't know.,86,,
616,0.97,4984.245,4993.088,"Chief, do you want to address that or Doig?",86,,
617,0.97,4993.088,4994.356,"Go ahead, Doug.",87,,
618,0.97,4994.356,4995.89,I was yielding.,88,,
619,0.97,4995.89,4999.594,As far as I know I can't pull the numbers.,88,,
620,0.97,4999.594,5013.308,I know that we are--we try to recruit as many women as we can and in the past classes we have had anywhere from seven to ten women in a recruit class.,88,,
621,0.97,5013.308,5021.082,"Now how big the pool is, I'm not sure cause I'm in the room doing the interviews and page to selection.",88,,
622,0.97,5021.082,5022.517,That is the leadership level.,88,,
623,0.97,5022.517,5027.522,I believe chief Scoggins is in there with somebody else.,88,,
624,0.97,5027.522,5029.924,Maybe he can speak on it.,88,,
625,0.97,5029.924,5030.558,Sure.,89,,
626,0.97,5030.558,5047.909,Council member Herbold we have the Dem Graphics of each phase of the process from receiving the applications to the written exam to the interview process going into the recruit Academy and make up of the recruit Academy itself.,89,,
627,0.97,5047.909,5051.88,So far it runs close to the demographics that apply.,89,,
628,0.97,5051.88,5062.657,I will pull that information in our next Check-In have that for you to review.,89,,
629,0.97,5062.657,5063.091,Appreciate that.,90,,
630,0.97,5063.091,5063.391,Thank you.,90,,
631,0.97,5063.391,5085.38,So we want to do a good job of making sure we get people through and I think by having a good process to work with our recruit instructors we are making sure that we eliminate any implicit bias in the process.,91,,
632,0.97,5085.38,5088.283,Our next regard hair and uniform policy.,91,,
633,0.97,5088.283,5095.957,What we know is historically here uniform policies have used words that can be code language like conservative style.,91,,
634,0.97,5095.957,5098.193,Those things have unspoken racial under tones often.,91,,
635,0.97,5098.193,5104.599,What we wanted to do was up Kate the policy to create more inclusive language.,91,,
636,0.97,5104.599,5110.939,"And so words like conservative style, things like that with coded meetings have been eliminated from the policies.",91,,
637,0.97,5110.939,5117.612,They have been rewritten so that they are more Inclues Toif women and people of color.,91,,
638,0.97,5117.612,5125.587,"We just think it is a good policy, it is bear--a better policy than what it was before.",91,,
639,0.97,5125.587,5133.761,One of the things we did was create better options for women with their dress uniform.,91,,
640,0.97,5133.761,5147.909,Traditionally what happened was there was one choice of a uniform that was more tailored for men and now there is something that gives to women better options and more options for a dress uniform.,91,,
641,0.97,5147.909,5158.686,So the outcome of this particular policy was a more inclusive hair and policy for women and people of color and greater uniform choices for women.,91,,
642,0.97,5158.686,5165.326,"Then this gets to your--a little bit of your question, council member, regarding recruitment.",91,,
643,0.97,5165.326,5180.742,One of the things we know is that in the next five years there is an expectation there will be a significant loss of women and people of color in the fire Department and in officer positions.,91,,
644,0.97,5180.742,5210.605,"So given the fact that that number in the last year has declined, it will be important to make sure our recruiting efforts that those efforts are done in a way that are diverse, reflective of the community and will hopefully reverse some of the trends in terms of losses and this women and people of color based on retirements.",91,,
645,0.97,5210.605,5212.907,There is some numbers at the bottom.,91,,
646,0.97,5212.907,5221.182,Those percentages are something that were pulled from a survey from King County fire chiefs and hr staff.,91,,
647,0.97,5221.182,5222.183,The percentages are not particularly important.,91,,
648,0.97,5222.183,5239.934,What is important to note in those numbers are items of em PA basis emphasis that we want to look at.,91,,
649,0.97,5240.068,5250.078,At.,91,,
650,0.97,5250.878,5253.014,Needs to be better community outreach.,92,,
651,0.97,5253.014,5269.53,"How do you change the culture from the traditional idea of what a Fireman looks like to something that is a broader, more inclusive and equitable idea of what fire fighting looks like.",92,,
652,0.97,5269.53,5270.031,That includes women.,92,,
653,0.97,5270.031,5271.132,That includes people of color.,92,,
654,0.97,5271.132,5272.6,That includes not just tall people.,92,,
655,0.97,5272.6,5282.01,A broad range of people that can do this job effectively.,92,,
656,0.97,5282.01,5310.638,"So in terms of recruitment items, there has been participation and recruitment work group that is meant to give better ideas and create some good solution s solutions so one of the things that I believe that the chief wants to do and I have L have the chief address this is--work force development and recruiting plan.",92,,
657,0.97,5310.638,5318.98,I think there is some idea we might want to have a--[Indiscernible],92,,
658,0.97,5319.113,5323.785,That is a position the Council had funded in years past.,93,,
659,0.97,5323.785,5329.123,It was vacant when we entered into Covid.,93,,
660,0.97,5329.123,5342.77,That is a position we will be bringing back forward because this will be critical to our recruitment.,93,,
661,0.97,5342.77,5347.642,"We need someone dedicated to that position, not some win else taken on another committee assignment.",93,,
662,0.97,5347.642,5353.715,There is a difference in what we would get out of a person.,93,,
663,0.97,5353.715,5354.282,"Thank you, chief.",94,,
664,0.97,5354.282,5367.195,One of the other things that we have done in addition to that hope to add to our staff.,94,,
665,0.97,5367.195,5372.734,We have added a member to our team on our hiring panels.,94,,
666,0.97,5372.734,5386.147,That has something that allows more diverse panels to--because that is one of the things we know makes a difference in terms of how you diversify your work force is to have diverse panels.,94,,
667,0.97,5386.147,5396.657,So that is another item that has been identified and has been improved upon in our processes.,94,,
668,0.97,5396.657,5408.503,The next two slides talk ABT about our Dem Graphics and the change between 2019 and 2021.,94,,
669,0.97,5408.503,5409.771,There is a lot of numbers there.,94,,
670,0.97,5409.771,5413.174,I think I will pass this over to Katherine Johnson.,94,,
671,0.97,5413.174,5425.553,It is the idea of having our Dem Graphics and understanding the way the trends are going so that we can have a better idea of how it is we want to have targeted recruitment efforts.,94,,
672,0.97,5425.553,5426.187,Thank you.,95,,
673,0.97,5426.187,5427.722,You have been a great addition to the team.,95,,
674,0.97,5427.722,5431.526,I know you have been here about a year and a half now.,95,,
675,0.97,5431.526,5435.797,Thanks for all your hard work.,95,,
676,0.97,5435.797,5440.601,The screen a little jaded with me.,95,,
677,0.97,5440.601,5445.807,The bottom right should have a 186.,95,,
678,0.97,5445.807,5454.715,That is how many people of color we had in 2019.,95,,
679,0.97,5454.715,5455.75,That did jump up.,95,,
680,0.97,5455.75,5463.925,It goes to 233.,95,,
681,0.97,5463.925,5482.109,The struggle we are having is basically the time it takes to get promoted and have people of color and women in promoted ranks.,95,,
682,0.97,5482.109,5484.479,Especially the executive leadership ranks.,95,,
683,0.97,5484.479,5497.825,So we lost four women that went from 15 to 11 from 2019 to 2021 for women in the promoted ranks.,95,,
684,0.97,5497.825,5515.843,We did gain one black which would bring it to 14 but over the two years we probably promoted promoted 40 or 50 people so one person is really a challenge for us.,95,,
685,0.97,5515.843,5520.615,We have 38 retirements already this year.,95,,
686,0.97,5520.615,5530.892,Three have been women which would leave approximately I believe two or so under the age of retirement.,95,,
687,0.97,5530.892,5539.033,Because of this we have this climb in women that takes about seven years to promote from firefighter Lieutenant.,95,,
688,0.97,5539.033,5543.537,Another several--several tone,95,,
689,0.97,5543.537,5548.276,From lieutenant to captain and another seven to go from captain to chief.,96,,
690,0.97,5548.276,5552.413,If that person is studying hard and navigating the system in a way to want to promote.,96,,
691,0.97,5552.413,5571.966,"So if you add those up, that is about 21 years to get into the executive leadership area and we will have basically--into the age of 50 in about a couple of years as far as I know.",96,,
692,0.97,5571.966,5582.476,The list that goes goes 20 deep is around number 35 now because of all the retirements.,96,,
693,0.97,5582.476,5584.345,We have promoted no women.,96,,
694,0.97,5584.345,5593.12,There is one woman that was chose to do a Paramedic instead of taking the lieutenant spot.,96,,
695,0.97,5593.12,5603.998,"Um, so--what it brings us to is we need--four of the things we will work on is increasing funding for recruiting and changing a marketing practices.",96,,
696,0.97,5603.998,5610.037,We will continue review our hiring practices and obstacles for barriers.,96,,
697,0.97,5610.037,5632.526,"Community outreach for entry level of course and changing the Cuture of the institution which means being more inclusive, extra events in which you give experience in which gives you avenues and material for your boards.",96,,
698,0.97,5632.526,5637.064,That is really our numbers here for 2019 to 2021.,96,,
699,0.97,5637.064,5647.908,Our challenge really is getting women promoted into those ranks.,96,,
700,0.97,5647.908,5651.679,"Thank you, Captain Johnson.",97,,
701,0.97,5651.679,5653.014,So this is our final slide.,97,,
702,0.97,5653.014,5658.519,We were Tasked to talk about the spirit of and the fire Department.,97,,
703,0.97,5658.519,5663.658,I want to talk about the first thing because I think it is very important.,97,,
704,0.97,5663.658,5674.769,So the fire chief and firefighters actively involve themselves in community outreach and a presence during the protest by handing out water.,97,,
705,0.97,5674.769,5678.939,I see this as not just some symbolic gesture.,97,,
706,0.97,5678.939,5688.215,"This was very, very smart in my opinion on the chief's part because it was critical we had the ability to get services into that area.",97,,
707,0.97,5688.215,5708.002,That area needed there to be a presence of a Seattle fire Department because there were a lot of things happening and creating that community relationship and gaining some points with them was something that was really critically important to being able to provide services in that area.,97,,
708,0.97,5708.002,5719.18,I thought that was a great job by the chief and so--again I think that was just a really big thing that showed the spirit by Sfd.,97,,
709,0.97,5719.18,5722.883,There are some other things we have done as well.,97,,
710,0.97,5722.883,5726.087,I mentioned our training where Dr. Hollands.,97,,
711,0.97,5726.087,5729.09,That has been something that was done.,97,,
712,0.97,5729.09,5737.565,We had race and social justice town halls and conversations about the protests that were done after hours.,97,,
713,0.97,5737.565,5745.106,"Those things were really important because it created a space for people to talk about what they were feeling, what was going on.",97,,
714,0.97,5745.106,5752.98,The fact that there was a need for our members to be in those areas and that we were in the middle of many of these things.,97,,
715,0.97,5752.98,5758.519,When cars were being set on fire it was our people that were down there taking care of those things.,97,,
716,0.97,5758.519,5767.361,So to have those town halls and talk about our involvement and the need for these services is critically important.,97,,
717,0.97,5767.361,5774.668,Our Covid testing and vaccination locations were done with a lens.,97,,
718,0.97,5774.668,5785.079,Those things were placed in places where they were accessible to a diverse swath of our community.,97,,
719,0.97,5785.079,5794.088,There are Metrics we have that prove that.,97,,
720,0.97,5794.088,5796.557,Again our continued good relationship and communication with the leadership.,97,,
721,0.97,5796.557,5806.367,I think I will finish with the chief to note that there are the local fire chiefs and their participation and some regional efforts.,97,,
722,0.97,5806.367,5808.002,"If you can address that, chief, please.",97,,
723,0.97,5808.002,5808.569,Sure.,98,,
724,0.97,5808.569,5815.543,One of our goals is to improve here in Seattle but it is also to improve in our region.,98,,
725,0.97,5815.543,5816.443,That is important for us.,98,,
726,0.97,5816.443,5823.117,"So working with my peers across the county, we have started King County fire Chiefs diversity equity and inclusion community.",98,,
727,0.97,5823.117,5832.426,We have done some things that I think are having a positive impact on improving recruitment of women and people of color.,98,,
728,0.97,5832.426,5844.004,For example we have our women and fire EMS workshops Duo--we do twice a year.,98,,
729,0.97,5844.004,5850.344,We have done that for three years now.,98,,
730,0.97,5850.344,5853.781,This year we are standing up our first recruitment workshop.,98,,
731,0.97,5853.781,5858.586,The first one will be hosted in Bell view and we will rotate that around the county.,98,,
732,0.97,5858.586,5862.723,We will have on going recruitment for all of the agencies.,98,,
733,0.97,5862.723,5866.393,We are developing some other things that are going to help other agencies.,98,,
734,0.97,5866.393,5870.664,We are also learning from each other.,98,,
735,0.97,5870.664,5883.377,"Chief Scoggins, that last slide for me really demonstrates how they work in a Department and it is not just about the four racial equity tool kits I do each year.",99,,
736,0.97,5883.377,5903.797,It is about how you bring these principles into your everyday work and the work you have done around key stride vaccination and Covid testing in 2020 and 2021 is a shining example of your commitment to racial equity.,99,,
737,0.97,5903.797,5926.52,"Like wise you and I had conversation during the Soesh Yaunl rest and I strongly support your decision to be present and to build trust with the participants through your presence, your physical presence during those really difficult days.",99,,
738,0.97,5926.52,5933.193,So just want to thank you and everybody at the Seattle fire Department for your commitment to this work.,99,,
739,0.97,5933.193,5950.044,I also want to just also--sunlight because of the examples you very Transparently I appreciate that identified around white su Prem schism and extremism within the Department.,99,,
740,0.97,5950.044,5963.957,I want to thank you for the fact you have--agreed to participate in the work that Dr.,99,,
741,0.97,5963.957,5964.224,Con is doing.,99,,
742,0.97,5964.525,6033.26,[Indiscernible] they are developing an Anti-Extremism course and they are piloting it among external facing city employees and as mentioned the fire Department has volunteered employees to participate in that pilot and I really want to thank you for doing that.,99,,
743,0.97,6033.26,6033.694,Thank you.,100,,
744,0.97,6033.694,6034.862,That concludes our presentation.,100,,
745,0.97,6034.862,6037.464,I don't know if there are any questions or not.,100,,
746,0.97,6037.464,6047.141,Just looking to see whether or not I have any hands raised virtually or any physical hands being raised.,101,,
747,0.97,6047.141,6047.374,And --,101,,
748,0.97,6047.374,6077.738,No questions but I did want to--I did want to sort of echo--just sort of appreciate you Council member Herbold for making those observations as a follow up to this presentation and want to thank the Rsji over at Sfd for the important work and for--how we can continue to lift up others in these leadership positions.,102,,
749,0.97,6077.738,6083.31,It really is critical and look forward to continuing to be apart of that effort.,102,,
750,0.97,6083.31,6083.777,Thank you.,103,,
751,0.97,6083.777,6094.488,Council member Herbold I wanted to thank Doug and Julie and all the members of our--[Indiscernible] because one of the things I know they do is they push you.,104,,
752,0.97,6094.488,6097.057,We all need to be pushed from time to time.,104,,
753,0.97,6097.057,6103.764,I think we have some very honest and spirited conversations but it is all because we all want to improve.,104,,
754,0.97,6103.764,6112.773,I want to thank them for owning the work and thank them for stepping into this difficult space to tackle some of these issues.,104,,
755,0.97,6112.773,6121.815,We are going to stay on it and I think we have a good team working on it.,104,,
756,0.97,6121.815,6122.583,Thank you.,105,,
757,0.97,6122.583,6123.45,All right.,105,,
758,0.97,6123.45,6125.018,Really appreciate you being here.,105,,
759,0.97,6125.018,6127.588,Moving on to our next item on the agenda.,105,,
760,0.97,6127.588,6135.662,Will the clerk please read the item into the agenda.,105,,
761,0.97,6135.662,6139.533,Agenda it number 3.,106,,
762,0.97,6139.533,6152.412,"A resolution approving the the 2021-2026 revision to the Seattle All-Hazards mitigation plan for briefing, discussion and possible vote.",106,,
763,0.97,6152.412,6155.182,Thank you.,107,,
764,0.97,6155.182,6159.052,My hope is Revote on this item to day as well.,107,,
765,0.97,6159.052,6161.555,The amendment is quick background on June 6th.,107,,
766,0.97,6161.555,6167.394,Director curry came to the public safety and human services committee to present a draft to the plan.,107,,
767,0.97,6167.394,6185.746,"I think are some additional introductory remarks as a refresher for us and what the plan contains t obligation to prepare the plan and I am going to hand it over--and the amendment itself, hand it over the Lisa Kaye",107,,
768,0.97,6185.746,6186.713,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",108,,
769,0.97,6186.713,6196.223,I will share my screen so while I'm talking I will have the resolution on the screen.,108,,
770,0.97,6196.223,6198.458,Okay.,108,,
771,0.97,6198.458,6204.131,"Is that showing to you, now?",108,,
772,0.97,6204.131,6204.331,Great.,108,,
773,0.97,6204.331,6204.531,Okay.,108,,
774,0.97,6204.531,6207.201,"So--I am Lisa Kaye, central staff.",108,,
775,0.97,6207.201,6213.473,As you mentioned office of emergency manager director is also on the call.,108,,
776,0.97,6213.473,6227.521,Today resolution 32011 would approve an updated plan for the city of Seattle which will then be forwarded to the state emergency management division and to FEMA for their review and final approval.,108,,
777,0.97,6227.521,6239.433,As curry mentioned the city needs to adopt a mitigation plan and update it once every five years to be eligible for FEMA mitigation grants.,108,,
778,0.97,6239.433,6246.873,The council last approved this Flan December of 2015.,108,,
779,0.97,6246.873,6250.544,Director Mayor presented the plan.,108,,
780,0.97,6250.544,6266.727,The plan does identify hazards to which the city is most vulnerable and identifies advanced actions the city can take to reduce negative impacts of those hazards.,108,,
781,0.97,6266.727,6283.243,In addition to the city's established mitigation programs the plan before you today identifies 47 on going or planned mitigation activities and projects that would reduce vulnerability to hazards.,108,,
782,0.97,6283.243,6294.221,The projects were selected using effectiveness and freeze ability criteria including the extent to which an action or project would reduce hazard vulnerability for communities.,108,,
783,0.97,6294.221,6305.666,"Between now and the next five year update, Oam will coordinate and make appropriate revisions based on project status, new information or emerging needs.",108,,
784,0.97,6305.666,6323.984,I would NOTE if the community APPROVES the resolution today Council will be asked to approve a technical amendment to clarify the resolution is also adopting in--[Indiscernible] that is my report Madam chair.,108,,
785,0.97,6323.984,6331.725,I can describe the amendment now or wait as you see fit.,108,,
786,0.97,6331.725,6349.309,Just Looping to see whether or not there are any questions about the resolution or the plan is contained here in before we get to the amendment itself.,109,,
787,0.97,6349.309,6349.743,Not seeing any.,109,,
788,0.97,6349.743,6350.243,"Yes, please.",109,,
789,0.97,6350.243,6350.477,Okay.,110,,
790,0.97,6350.477,6372.032,So I will just Scroll to the amendment amendment 1 which is sponsored by Council member Herbold requests mitigation planning for flight and day Saser--disaster and excessive heat events.,110,,
791,0.97,6372.032,6398.358,It asks the office of emergency management to report to Council any deficiencies identified by those communities for Oams consideration in a second plan.,110,,
792,0.97,6398.358,6405.665,That is what I have Council member.,110,,
793,0.97,6405.665,6411.671,Thank you so much.,111,,
794,0.97,6411.671,6413.74,So the amendment incorporates two new concepts.,111,,
795,0.97,6413.74,6422.416,The first was brought to my attention from the residents of the Georgetown and beacon Hill neighbors.,111,,
796,0.97,6422.416,6488.281,Communities that live under the flight path and really appreciate director Mayor's willingness to work with those community members both in identifying what planning has been done through the old hazard mitigation plan that sort of fits the needs of that community because that is the idea of a all hazards mitigation plan is it doesn't assume we need a plan for every hazard but it assumes by planning for all hazards in that we can meet the needs of individual hazards but never the less I think the on going engagement of Oam with those communities will help us surface whether or not there needs to be hazards planning and mitigation specific to fight path related disasters.,111,,
797,0.97,6488.281,6502.462,So again really appreciate the willingness of Oam to continue working with those communities to determine whether or not there is more we need to consider in a future plan.,111,,
798,0.97,6502.462,6524.718,"And as it relates to heat events, again just wanting to identify that there--that there is an interest in need ton part of the Council and Oam doing heat event specific hazard mitigation planning.",111,,
799,0.97,6524.718,6561.454,We have learned over the last couple of months that other cities do have individual plans specific to heat events and again appreciate the willingness of director Meredith to take on that body of work as it appears that because of the impacts of climate change we are very likely to have an increase number and frequency of extreme heat events moving forward.,111,,
800,0.97,6561.454,6569.462,Are there any questions about the proposed amendment?,111,,
801,0.97,6569.462,6570.931,From my colleagues.,111,,
802,0.97,6570.931,6571.197,All right.,111,,
803,0.97,6571.197,6571.765,Not seeing any.,111,,
804,0.97,6571.765,6594.287,"I think I would like to--lets see, first get the resolution in front of me or in front of us so--with that we will--I will move resolution 32011.",111,,
805,0.97,6594.287,6595.488,Is there a second?,111,,
806,0.97,6595.488,6595.755,Second.,112,,

830,0.97,6661.688,6671.231,Lisa Kaye has reviewed them but--so that will be at full council.,125,,

843,0.97,6702.328,6704.898,Moving on to our final committee item.,135,,
844,0.97,6704.898,6707.901,Will the clerk Cleez read in agenda item 4.,135,,
845,0.97,6707.901,6716.409,Agenda item 4 Summery findings on the executive order on Re-Imagining policing and community safety.,136,,
846,0.97,6716.409,6717.21,"Thank you, Alex.",137,,
847,0.97,6717.21,6738.298,We are going to be starting this presentation with a brief over view from the Council central staff as a way of giving us context to center this discussion.,137,,
848,0.97,6738.298,6743.269,Important context about what we are receiving a report on.,137,,
849,0.97,6743.269,6746.473,So I think that will be a good place to start.,137,,
850,0.97,6746.473,6753.913,We turn it over to the executive team to do their the introduction and presentation.,137,,
851,0.97,6753.913,6762.422,"Can we first have Introductionings by the central staff team, please.",137,,
852,0.97,6762.422,6763.957,My name is Amy.,138,,
853,0.97,6763.957,6766.693,And my name is Greg.,139,,
854,0.97,6766.693,6767.193,All right.,140,,
855,0.97,6767.193,6767.761,Great.,140,,
856,0.97,6767.761,6775.769,And I am going to need to share my screen.,140,,
857,0.97,6775.769,6777.203,I think--there we go.,140,,
858,0.97,6777.203,6779.773,Okay.,140,,
859,0.97,6779.773,6780.774,Okay.,140,,
860,0.97,6780.774,6783.743,As I mentioned my name is Amy with Council central staff.,140,,
861,0.97,6783.743,6789.783,Can you see my screen at this point?,140,,
862,0.97,6789.783,6790.016,Yes.,141,,
863,0.97,6790.016,6790.65,Okay.,142,,
864,0.97,6790.65,6803.163,Ghif give me one more second to make sure I can change the slides.,142,,
865,0.97,6803.163,6803.496,Lets see here.,142,,
866,0.97,6803.496,6811.437,"Um, so today Greg and I will be discussing re imagining police and public safety.",142,,
867,0.97,6811.437,6818.011,We are going to--sorry I'm having trouble moving the slides down.,142,,
868,0.97,6818.011,6818.811,There we go.,142,,
869,0.97,6818.811,6832.058,So first we will review executive order 202010 and resolution 316--excuse me 31 31962.,142,,
870,0.97,6832.058,6842.635,Then we will discuss crisis response focussing on key themes from the what works city Sprint which was an eight week course on alternative response that many of us participated in recently.,142,,
871,0.97,6842.635,6855.248,We will discuss at high level mobile crisis response program design and alternative 911 response for Noncrisis situations.,142,,
872,0.97,6855.248,6859.752,"Um, as you recall Council adopted resolution 318962 this August of 2020.",142,,
873,0.97,6859.752,6872.198,It was based on the process and principles outlined in the 2020 blue Froint police divestment and police reinvestment from Decriminalize Seattle and King County equity now.,142,,
874,0.97,6872.198,6891.751,"It included a commitment to create a civilian led public safety Department to explore moving functions out of SPD, examine enforcement practices for racial disparities and review 911 call response priorities.",142,,
875,0.97,6891.751,6904.397,In September of 2020 the major issued executive order 202010 which included several strategies to re imagine policing and community safety by Censoring the voices.,142,,
876,0.97,6904.397,6917.744,I know they will discuss this momentarily but briefly the strategies were first to establish a community safety and safety work group and functional analysis interdepartmental team.,142,,
877,0.97,6917.744,6938.798,"Second to conduct community--[Indiscernible] fourth, to examine models of community policing.",142,,
878,0.97,6938.798,6950.71,"Fifth, to advocate for changes to state law and finally to establish a functional transfer interdepartmental team to support transfer of functions out of SPD.",142,,
879,0.97,6950.71,6961.454,Now we will go into a little more detail on alternative responses to crisis and Non-Crisis calls which is a critical component of minimizing or eliminating armed officer response.,142,,
880,0.97,6961.454,6968.661,First we will over view some of the key themes.,142,,
881,0.97,6968.661,6970.897,All right.,143,,
882,0.97,6970.897,6982.208,Earlier this year city staff were fortunate enough to partner with government staff from around the nation as part of a Bloomberg sponsored course.,143,,
883,0.97,6982.208,6991.984,The course was hosted by what works city Sprint and featured many of the service providers that are already providing alternative 911 responses.,143,,
884,0.97,6991.984,6997.056,This represented representatives from cahoots and Yooug and the Star program in Denver.,143,,
885,0.97,6997.056,7004.364,Over a series of eight 1 hour sessions we got a lot of advice from the providers.,143,,
886,0.97,7004.364,7021.147,"First, as you can see in the first bullet police presence can be trigger fog people in behavioral crisis and can unintentionally escalate a crisis situation.",143,,
887,0.97,7021.147,7027.12,We also heard clearly any kind of uniform can be trigger fog a person experiencing a behavioral health crisis.,143,,
888,0.97,7027.12,7039.999,Not because of Paramedic or a firefighter harmed anyone but because a uniform can represent a system that may have created a negative outcome for a particular individual.,143,,
889,0.97,7039.999,7048.474,We heard from representatives a cahoots had in order to build trust sometimes you have to be willing to walk away and approach the individual at another time.,143,,
890,0.97,7048.474,7059.552,That requires a different kind of mindset from that of a typical uniformed officer who is usually trained to clear a call in the system.,143,,
891,0.97,7059.552,7078.704,We heard in a break out session between cahoots and the Seattle delegation that a Cahoot representative thought it would be very helpful had she had access to case histories in the way that Seattle's units have.,143,,
892,0.97,7078.704,7096.022,Then Finally we heard from Seattle's lead representatives very importantly that the harm that is disproportionately inflicted on vulnerable communities and communities of color can only be alleviated when police are no longer sent to low level criminal calls like Trespassing.,143,,
893,0.97,7096.022,7106.099,And I will talk more about that later.,143,,
894,0.97,7106.099,7106.899,"Thank you, Greg.",144,,
895,0.97,7106.899,7107.166,Lets see.,144,,
896,0.97,7107.166,7125.985,"So this slide is adapted from the substance Aboois abuse and mental health services administrations, national guide lines for behavioral health crisis care which recommends three core components of crisis response which they call someone to talk to, someone to respond and a place to go.",144,,
897,0.97,7125.985,7138.798,"I want to highlight while it is not part of the same model, I want to note all crisis response relies on preventive and support services to reduce the need for crisis interventions.",144,,
898,0.97,7138.798,7147.807,"Everything from housing, health care, case management, diversion, peer support, all of that can play a role this helping support and stabilize individuals.",144,,
899,0.97,7147.807,7154.647,In addition the organizations which provide these services are a key resource during a crisis.,144,,
900,0.97,7154.647,7163.422,"Responders often call in case managers, health care providers or other service procedures who have a longer term relationship with the individual.",144,,
901,0.97,7163.422,7172.331,"Even though crisis response may not be their primary service they provide, they are often part of the crisis response.",144,,
902,0.97,7172.331,7183.009,So as you can see the city has resources for all three core components including crisis call center with several types of crisis lines.,144,,
903,0.97,7183.009,7187.98,This will be supplemented in 2022 with the 988 emergency line.,144,,
904,0.97,7187.98,7202.795,The city has mobile teams to respond to crisis situations including the crisis response unit and the mobile crisis team.,144,,
905,0.97,7202.795,7209.702,We are still working on learning whether that will fund a new program or an expansion of mobile--of existing mobile teams.,144,,
906,0.97,7209.702,7218.044,I want to note that in the presentation on the agenda the mobile crisis team was labeled as the SPD mobile crisis team which is incorrect.,144,,
907,0.97,7218.044,7223.316,The mobile crisis team is operated by the down town emergency services center.,144,,
908,0.97,7223.316,7229.889,Finally the third key component of a crisis response is receiving and stabilization services.,144,,
909,0.97,7229.889,7232.925,This is where can we take somebody in crisis?,144,,
910,0.97,7232.925,7250.343,And Seattle and King County include the crisis diversion facility as well as interim services and programs which are stepped downed services after Exiting the crisis diversion facility.,144,,
911,0.97,7250.343,7255.548,The next two slides briefly outline the mobile crisis program designed elements to consider.,144,,
912,0.97,7255.548,7259.952,These are some of the decisions that can really change how the program operates.,144,,
913,0.97,7259.952,7264.19,The first is what type of calls are directed to an alternate response.,144,,
914,0.97,7264.19,7278.07,"In general the types of calls that come in can be medical, criminal or crisis which is a broad term for a Non-Medical, Non-Criminal call although there is a lot of over lap in these situations during the Sprint.",144,,
915,0.97,7278.07,7282.875,A second key component of a mobile crisis program is how a team is dispatched.,144,,
916,0.97,7282.875,7289.815,Usually through the 911 system or through a direct line.,144,,
917,0.97,7289.815,7293.419,Program coverage is where and when the program is available.,144,,
918,0.97,7293.419,7302.361,"It relates to both hours and geography as well as the scale of the program, how many units are available to respond to calls.",144,,
919,0.97,7302.361,7332.324,"There is the operation of the program whether it is operated by the jurisdiction, whether it is through a contract with an organization or if it is a hybrid such as the health one which is run by the city but includes health professionals and case managers which are through contract with the local community organization.",144,,
920,0.97,7332.324,7333.592,Staffing for the program is key.,144,,
921,0.97,7333.592,7367.359,"It can be anything from a sworn officer if it is a police response, Emt and firefighters, mental health professionals, designated crisis responders who are mental health professionals authorized by the state to--evaluate folks for involuntary treatment and then we have also got peer responders who are folks that have experience with behavioral health issues that can provide services for folks.",144,,
922,0.97,7367.359,7371.831,There is different models based on police participation.,144,,
923,0.97,7371.831,7373.966,You can have police led models.,144,,
924,0.97,7373.966,7378.871,You can have Co-Responder models and community led models.,144,,
925,0.97,7378.871,7389.248,As well as a wide range of services that are provide by the team and throughput is where can the team refer to people?,144,,
926,0.97,7389.248,7400.159,We heard it is that throughput that is important in terms of minimizing and reducing the need for the crisis team in the future.,144,,
927,0.97,7400.159,7401.627,I forgot to turn that slide.,144,,
928,0.97,7401.627,7416.842,"So the next three slides are a table which compares the Seattle programs which crisis response unit, health one and mobile crisis team to three alternative response models.",144,,
929,0.97,7416.842,7429.054,It began as a community led response in Olympia.,144,,
930,0.97,7429.054,7432.458,I did want to highlight a couple of elements of these programs.,144,,
931,0.97,7432.458,7436.662,So the first is a direct line to the alternative response.,144,,
932,0.97,7436.662,7442.768,Both cahoots and Star can be called by individuals without going through 911.,144,,
933,0.97,7442.768,7452.011,This reduces strain on the emergency system and provides services for folks who might not want to call 191 for whatever reason.,144,,
934,0.97,7452.011,7458.451,It has access to a police scanner and self dispatches to calls they feel they could help with.,144,,
935,0.97,7458.451,7466.358,Second the city does not have a Non-Spd alternative for low level criminal calls.,144,,
936,0.97,7466.358,7474.266,While they respond to trespass unwanted person calls which could be criminal calls.,144,,
937,0.97,7474.266,7488.38,We heard a lot from providers that this is a really key element of a program that helps avoid interactions with the police for folks that could be triggering or problematic.,144,,
938,0.97,7488.38,7496.388,Third these programs are staffed by individuals with a wide range of qualifications.,144,,
939,0.97,7496.388,7511.237,I want to note in the final row of the slide please participation reflects how the program is designed in terms of police presence in the response.,144,,
940,0.97,7511.237,7516.809,However police can be called in as back up or many a Co-Response in all these models.,144,,
941,0.97,7516.809,7521.48,In addition some of these programs are dispatched through police referrals as well.,144,,
942,0.97,7521.48,7527.419,So I just wanted to run through that quickly since I know we don't have a lot of time.,144,,
943,0.97,7527.419,7533.993,Finally turn it back to Greg to discuss some Non-Crisis alternatives.,144,,
944,0.97,7533.993,7534.226,Okay.,145,,
945,0.97,7534.226,7555.748,We have been talking a lot about crisis response and what Amy made very clear is that Seattle is doing a good job already with some of the behavioral and mental health crisis such as the Desc and the health one response.,145,,
946,0.97,7555.748,7565.758,"Not that those things can't be expanded to meet much, much greater need but that the--there is a response for that area.",145,,
947,0.97,7565.758,7580.739,I will talk a little bit more about the community Responder model that aim my just brought up which is a model developed by the law enforcement partnership and the center for American progress.,145,,
948,0.97,7580.739,7586.111,That model contemplates a couple of other responses.,145,,
949,0.97,7586.111,7588.447,Breaking it Autointo two different categories.,145,,
950,0.97,7588.447,7591.216,One being quality of life issues.,145,,
951,0.97,7591.216,7595.788,These are wellness checks for intoxicated persons or substance abuse.,145,,
952,0.97,7595.788,7606.231,That space or that bucket if you will is an area that I think is addressed or is likely to be addressed by what the executive is putting forth in triage 1.,145,,
953,0.97,7606.231,7613.639,I think we will hear about that with the executives presentation next.,145,,
954,0.97,7613.639,7620.012,Then second bucket the community Responder model talks about is the low level conflict.,145,,
955,0.97,7620.012,7625.517,Those are calls where there is a potential for an arrest if an officer is involved.,145,,
956,0.97,7625.517,7628.253,It can be a gate way into the criminal justice system.,145,,
957,0.97,7628.253,7633.759,Those are low level calls such as a trespass or noise complaint.,145,,
958,0.97,7633.759,7634.426,It is a suspicious person.,145,,
959,0.97,7634.426,7643.636,It is a call that might not necessarily be criminal but sending an officer might turn into it a criminal call.,145,,
960,0.97,7643.636,7661.453,Cahoots has responded to these calls now sending a credible messenger can ensure vulnerable individuals are not needlessly entering the criminal justice system.,145,,
961,0.97,7661.453,7661.887,"Next slide, Amy.",145,,
962,0.97,7661.887,7676.769,Of course Lastly just quickly on these alternative 911 Non-Crisis response there are administrative responders that could be doing things like taking traffic reports.,145,,
963,0.97,7676.902,7713.205,[Indiscernible] there are sly--the Council has--adopted--[Indiscernible] we learned that over the last four years there were 1200 something calls for hard Voir dire patrol to clear debris from the water way.,145,,
964,0.97,7713.205,7729.688,Maybe not that is not an Thait activity that requires a sworn officer.,145,,
965,0.97,7729.688,7734.093,And that concludes our presentation.,145,,
966,0.97,7734.093,7753.479,Thank you so much for again getting this context with the charge of the original executive order as well as the Council slides and the intended context being identifying as you say the breath of opportunities.,146,,
967,0.97,7753.479,7757.382,Really appreciate knowing about an opportunity that we can move on quickly.,146,,
968,0.97,7757.382,7767.559,I think there is a lot more there that we need to do more analysis and more development of alternatives.,146,,
969,0.97,7767.559,7780.339,More that will not be before us today but I look forward to continued engagement.,146,,
970,0.97,7780.339,7796.054,With that would love to hear from the part--participants on the exec executive side.,146,,
971,0.97,7796.054,7802.094,I will start us off and then we can pass it along as we go.,147,,
972,0.97,7802.094,7802.661,I'm Julie Kline.,147,,
973,0.97,7802.661,7816.108,I'm the Mayor's public safety advisor and one of the members of the inner departmental team set up by the Mayor's executive order last fall.,147,,
974,0.97,7816.108,7824.283,"Also present with me today, Christina Grover-Roybal.",147,,
975,0.97,7824.283,7824.65,Hey everyone.,148,,
976,0.97,7824.65,7833.625,"We are in the same general I--vicinity, we are getting an echo.",148,,
977,0.97,7833.625,7834.326,Hey everyone.,149,,
978,0.97,7834.326,7835.561,I'm Christina Grover-Roybal.,149,,
979,0.97,7835.561,7838.864,I will pass it over to Sonny.,149,,
980,0.97,7838.864,7839.665,Hello.,150,,
981,0.97,7839.665,7842.234,My name is Sonny Nguyen.,150,,
982,0.97,7842.234,7851.577,I'm in the Mayor's office as her senior external affairs liaison and I will pass it over the Angela.,150,,
983,0.97,7851.577,7852.177,Good morning Angela Socci.,151,,
984,0.97,7852.177,7857.683,I'm the executive director.,151,,
985,0.97,7857.683,7860.052,"Chris, to you want to go?",151,,
986,0.97,7860.052,7868.026,"Chris Fisher, executive director at the Seattle police Department.",152,,
987,0.97,7868.026,7873.031,I will pass it to director.,152,,
988,0.97,7873.031,7873.665,Good morning.,153,,
989,0.97,7873.665,7874.833,Chris Lombard.,153,,
990,0.97,7874.833,7880.739,I will pass it to chief Scoggins.,153,,
991,0.97,7880.739,7883.475,Chief may have had to drop off.,154,,
992,0.97,7883.475,7883.876,He Texted me.,154,,
993,0.97,7883.876,7892.985,I think we have John from the Seattle fire Department.,154,,
994,0.97,7892.985,7893.185,John.,154,,
995,0.97,7893.185,7893.585,Good morning.,155,,
996,0.97,7893.585,7894.186,"Jon Ehrenfeld, Seattle fire.",155,,
997,0.97,7894.186,7897.556,Julie may be back to you.,155,,
998,0.97,7897.556,7898.423,Yeah.,156,,
999,0.97,7898.423,7898.724,"Thanks, Jon.",156,,
1000,0.97,7898.724,7898.991,All right.,156,,
1001,0.97,7898.991,7903.729,I will rely on Christie to throw up our power point here.,156,,
1002,0.97,7903.729,7915.774,Then we will get started and we will try to be a little mindful of time given where we are.,156,,
1003,0.97,7915.774,7918.81,So as we mentioned earlier--first of all thank you for having us on.,156,,
1004,0.97,7918.81,7944.269,"I think given the number of moving parts and the--us waiting and it not happening for the dust settle when it comes to SPD staffing, this--this--we call it a final report but I think will be evident is this is in fact not a final report and there is some very clear on going work to be done in this area.",156,,
1005,0.97,7944.269,7947.539,This report is coming later than I wanted.,156,,
1006,0.97,7947.539,7965.057,"I'm hopeful given the amount of information contained in here, that--there is a lot of--what is clear is there is a lot of rich areas to explore and re imagining policing as result of this report.",156,,
1007,0.97,7965.057,7986.278,One of our--you can see here the work and this report was one aspect of the Mayor's executive order on re imagining policing and boil down to its essence the Idt that will be presenting here today had three real main assignments to report out on.,156,,
1008,0.97,7986.278,7997.856,"That was conducting some community engagement and outreach, analyzing current SPD functions and practices and exploring some alternative models of community policing and response.",156,,
1009,0.97,7997.856,8008.033,And as a part of that we will go through all the different as Pekts of that that we have been working on for the past six or seven months or so.,156,,
1010,0.97,8008.033,8008.667,I think maybe longer now.,156,,
1011,0.97,8008.667,8022.647,"In conjunction with the work that the Idt has been doing and the work central staff has been doing, we thought it was very important aren't too also make sure we are mentioning folks--mentioning to folks this wasn't happening in a vacuum.",156,,
1012,0.97,8022.647,8030.889,There was lot of things happening in this space as we worked ton functional analysis and data aspects of this.,156,,
1013,0.97,8030.889,8042.1,Our human services Department conducted a request for proposals to invest $10.4 million into community safety capacity building proposals.,156,,
1014,0.97,8042.1,8061.853,We got 70 applications and these investments for the most part have done some initial--[Indiscernible] the bulk of these investments mostly work on upstream prevention and restoration efforts.,156,,
1015,0.97,8061.853,8068.794,So we didn't get any Turnkey proposals that could instantly become emergency response options or alternate models.,156,,
1016,0.97,8068.794,8072.097,At least not in the near term.,156,,
1017,0.97,8072.097,8083.775,Part of the awards for this Rfp were to start building capacity to move towards those types of models.,156,,
1018,0.97,8083.775,8087.913,We aren't discouraged by that necessarily.,156,,
1019,0.97,8087.913,8099.958,It is important to note there is an influence of money going towards upstream prevention and restoration efforts in this area.,156,,
1020,0.97,8099.958,8103.428,That will be working in conjunction with us.,156,,
1021,0.97,8103.428,8122.481,"As Greg and Amy mentioned there was also the what work city Sprint which the Idt participated in as well along with central staff, along with Council staff, along with some community members and community--based organizations and some of our other departments.",156,,
1022,0.97,8122.481,8127.652,We won't need to go into that.,156,,
1023,0.97,8127.652,8133.625,During this process we also had some external engagements.,156,,
1024,0.97,8133.625,8150.842,One with the National Institute of criminal justice reform which you will hear did the sort of functional analysis based on SPD's data that we cite and discuss in our report.,156,,
1025,0.97,8150.842,8161.786,So Christy Grover-Roybal who is here with me today was sort of project managing it and getting us across the finish line on the executive order.,156,,
1026,0.97,8161.786,8177.736,"Christie and--or Chris Fisher, anything to add before we move on?",156,,
1027,0.97,8177.736,8177.936,Okay.,156,,
1028,0.97,8177.936,8178.37,All right.,156,,
1029,0.97,8178.37,8188.38,"#23Rz I will kick it over the Sonny Nguyen who conducted and led a lot of the community outreach that was done through this effort so Sonny, take wait.",156,,
1030,0.97,8188.38,8189.581,Thank you.,157,,
1031,0.97,8189.581,8204.763,"We did a lot of--a few series of community engagement events including some Roundtables, some forums and a lot of engagement with our boards and engagements which are selected to represent different bodies of populations from Seattle.",157,,
1032,0.97,8204.763,8205.964,We have three major Takeaways.,157,,
1033,0.97,8205.964,8209.601,The first one community is not a model.,157,,
1034,0.97,8209.601,8219.01,"I am sure if your Inbox are anything like mine, you know that every person in Seattle has different idea of how we can re imagine community safety in our city.",157,,
1035,0.97,8219.01,8236.428,"And so while it is important we are hearing all of these, it is important we are Centerig up and lifting the voice of the people moves affected by our current policing system.",157,,
1036,0.97,8236.428,8245.136,Then from those engagements we found two kind of big buckets of feedback.,157,,
1037,0.97,8245.136,8262.22,"What we heard is that by the time someone was making a 911 call, a lot of times that incident is indicative of a number of different systems failures whether that be youth development, housing, job resources, mental health or even the medical institutions.",157,,
1038,0.97,8262.22,8271.296,So we are sending officers who are not well equipped to handle the actual roots of the issues going on in these communities.,157,,
1039,0.97,8271.296,8275.133,And the other is that people want a more visible patrol presence.,157,,
1040,0.97,8275.133,8309.668,A lot of folks in our downtown neighborhoods most especially in places like the Cid really Miss their community police officers which were redeployed due to staffing constraints and really wanted to talk or speak to a time when officers were walking the beach and were going into different businesses and getting to know the communities and the community members there and folks are able to build trusting and lasting relationships with the officers patrolling their neighborhoods.,157,,
1041,0.97,8309.668,8318.476,That is just a very quick Snapshot of the engagement assembly we have been doing and is some of the high level things.,157,,
1042,0.97,8318.476,8334.626,"So to kind of go over our major findings which all of my colleagues will drill into a little bit, we are having a massive staffing shortage.",158,,
1043,0.97,8334.626,8337.262,We have lost over 200 officers.,158,,
1044,0.97,8337.262,8339.197,"That translates to over 300,000 officer hours.",158,,
1045,0.97,8339.197,8344.769,We are just down in terms of physical capacity at the Department.,158,,
1046,0.97,8344.769,8359.751,Looking at the Nick Jr. analysis and the SPD analysis we identified 12% of calls for services that can be responded to with civilian forward or without SPD involvement in the near term.,158,,
1047,0.97,8359.751,8367.359,These are calls we can safely say we can remove or start to transfer starting today.,158,,
1048,0.97,8367.359,8372.597,With further analysis we can--there are more than beyond just this 12%.,158,,
1049,0.97,8372.597,8377.702,But to start we will be looking at the checks.,158,,
1050,0.97,8377.702,8396.221,"Based on what occurred with the community engagement, the shortage of hours, there is an immediate need to identify alternative responses that can take Non-Criminal calls away from SPD resources.",158,,
1051,0.97,8396.221,8396.554,. Okay.,158,,
1052,0.97,8396.554,8401.76,Angela or Chris.,158,,
1053,0.97,8401.76,8402.26,I think you are up next.,158,,
1054,0.97,8402.26,8411.77,Good evening.,159,,
1055,0.97,8411.77,8423.114,As folks are aware since 2020 we have lost a net negative of about 188 officers.,159,,
1056,0.97,8423.114,8455.747,The issue being as we talk about the ability to transfer some of this workload to alternative responses is that it actually that work would get us closer to having a number of officers who can handle the volume of work they are handling now.,159,,
1057,0.97,8455.747,8462.353,I think chief spoke about it yesterday.,159,,
1058,0.97,8462.353,8472.197,There aren't enough officers to handle call volume.,159,,
1059,0.97,8472.197,8482.64,Off loading service hours at this point as we will get into when we talk about the--report I think starts to make up for the folks we have lost.,159,,
1060,0.97,8482.64,8493.585,There are 100 less officers even with the--chief's reassign Mentassignment of individuals.,159,,
1061,0.97,8493.585,8496.187,That is translated to us not meeting our response times.,159,,
1062,0.97,8496.187,8503.161,We have talked about that before.,159,,
1063,0.97,8503.161,8503.795,That situation has not changed.,159,,
1064,0.97,8503.795,8512.17,We have not met it consistently.,159,,
1065,0.97,8512.17,8513.037,For about a year now.,159,,
1066,0.97,8513.037,8527.452,"The really the message here is as we look to this work at this point as we try to staff back up, as we try to do aggressive hiring, some of this in the near term is making it so that these calls have someone who can respond to them.",159,,
1067,0.97,8527.452,8539.998,"A lot of times the delay for these Non-Emergency, low priority calls is extensive given the officers are focussing on responding to these major events and violent crime and priority one calls.",159,,
1068,0.97,8539.998,8551.609,Some of the lower priority calls may take a while for officers to respond given our current staff.,159,,
1069,0.97,8551.609,8573.364,"For criminal justice reform as Julie mentioned, we asked them led by David who has a huge experience in reforming and looking at how criminal justice systems can work differently be it--working on consent decrees is a wealth of Sdmonl how to think differently.",159,,
1070,0.97,8573.364,8576.2,He has a great team at the National Institute.,159,,
1071,0.97,8576.2,8580.505,We ask them to look at three years of our call data.,159,,
1072,0.97,8580.505,8585.343,They have done this work in other mostly West Coast cities and a lot many California.,159,,
1073,0.97,8585.343,8586.611,They are based out of Oakland.,159,,
1074,0.97,8586.611,8590.982,They have a lot of on the ground relationships and understandings there.,159,,
1075,0.97,8590.982,8605.797,We asked them to look at that data and in our initial conversations they talked about how their approach has been Conceptualizing 911 alternative response or differential response in a four tier model.,159,,
1076,0.97,8605.797,8608.166,Tier one being some alternative response goes on their own.,159,,
1077,0.97,8608.166,8617.775,Those are the calls where it is clear and however you do the analysis that SPD is not needed.,159,,
1078,0.97,8617.775,8624.415,"The tier 2 is SPD is downstairs, around the corn, close by for a radio call.",159,,
1079,0.97,8624.415,8645.069,"If the alternative response needs back up, those are--maybe it is not quite as clear and then tier 3 is the reverse of that where SPD takes the lead, makes sure the scene 1 safe and clear and maybe steps back and lets the alternative response handle and tier 4 is a traditional SPD responding on their own.",159,,
1080,0.97,8645.069,8654.912,Maybe when they are done down they can call in if there are any additional services.,159,,
1081,0.97,8654.912,8658.549,That is sort of the model.,159,,
1082,0.97,8658.549,8659.751,They did that work.,159,,
1083,0.97,8659.751,8666.024,"They I Kent Guyed up to 49% of calls in their high level, not knowing how we use every call type.",159,,
1084,0.97,8666.024,8671.562,We as the city have a lot of call types.,159,,
1085,0.97,8671.562,8671.829,Over 350.,159,,
1086,0.97,8671.829,8675.133,Some places have less than 100.,159,,
1087,0.97,8675.133,8678.236,We are very differentiated in our type.,159,,
1088,0.97,8678.236,8688.179,They didn't necessarily and we weren't trying to be overly prescriptive with them.,159,,
1089,0.97,8688.179,8697.955,There were groups of calls where I think they not knowing how we used this system and what it means where they probably over index thinking someone else could respond to it.,159,,
1090,0.97,8697.955,8717.175,"Some of those are sort of administrative calls, getting gas, running, doing a run of evidence or Proactive calls where it if you see where it makes sense that maybe an officer doesn't need do a premise check.",159,,
1091,0.97,8717.175,8740.631,"That if you are just thinking about what those words mean, if you understand how we use that--a premise check could be this is a high crime or high violence area and we want officers to check out that parking lot, we want them there for visibility, we want them there to be in the area, we want them to stop there and get out and talk.",159,,
1092,0.97,8740.631,8744.235,It is not something as going and making sure the building is secured.,159,,
1093,0.97,8744.235,8746.17,There are other factors going in there.,159,,
1094,0.97,8746.17,8750.942,I think we want to continue to do work on refining it.,159,,
1095,0.97,8750.942,8774.232,"We also then when we were thinking through how do--and it was unrealistic to expect the National Institute to know every single one of those types and how we use and it what Ma that means on the ground, all of our legal--we have some Rcw and labor issues that some of this work has to be done by us a sworn peace officer.",159,,
1096,0.97,8774.232,8776.467,Some of that stuff probably easier to change than others.,159,,
1097,0.97,8776.467,8784.175,It was too much in the time frame and in the broad scope of the other work they do.,159,,
1098,0.97,8784.175,8795.153,So we were trying to think through how could we add intelligence on to this to make it more operational.,159,,
1099,0.97,8795.153,8807.765,We remarked in a lot of the conversations we have had with DOJ around consent decrees and the experts they use and some of the research team here at SPD.,159,,
1100,0.97,8807.765,8818.609,Dr. Jeff at the University of South Carolina is a long standing expert in high risk police community encounters.,159,,
1101,0.97,8818.609,8820.611,He has consulted for the U.S.,159,,
1102,0.97,8820.611,8842.333,Justice Department and international justice departments about sort of their version of inquest into police involved shootings and how to think about and Conceptionalize force and how to decrease or the the risk of police encounters.,159,,
1103,0.97,8842.333,8850.007,He came back I think with amazing recommendation I think we were Conceptionally thinking about but will not tied it all together.,159,,
1104,0.97,8850.007,8857.148,We have the ability in our data to know on each call type how often something significant happens.,159,,
1105,0.97,8857.148,8865.022,The National Institute looked at whether that call type was associated with a crime or whether an arrest was made.,159,,
1106,0.97,8865.022,8868.492,We can layer on that how often is the victim injured.,159,,
1107,0.97,8868.492,8869.594,How often is the subject injured.,159,,
1108,0.97,8869.594,8878.736,"How often is the use of force used and what type of use of force, what level of use of force and if someone is arrested and booked.",159,,
1109,0.97,8878.736,8897.989,You can come one a risk base--based model.,159,,
1110,0.97,8901.893,8904.095,Very rarely does something of significant happen.,159,,
1111,0.97,8904.095,8906.731,So I think that is the next stage of this work.,159,,
1112,0.97,8906.731,8921.979,I think we started to do that when we started having these conversations as director talked about it about this triage 1 model I know we talked with Council about it.,159,,
1113,0.97,8921.979,8926.651,That was--that is where that started to become Operationalized.,159,,
1114,0.97,8926.651,8931.422,We know this two specific call types because we talked about them for yours.,159,,
1115,0.97,8931.422,8943.868,Those are cases where very rarely something significant happening on the ground right there and that is why it made sense from all of those other--considerations a place to start.,159,,
1116,0.97,8943.868,8959.35,"We want to keep building on that, combining and the nuts and bolts work of doing the aggregate data that the National Institute did with this risk based model that he has weighed in makes a lot of sense and I think they come together nicely.",159,,
1117,0.97,8959.35,8960.518,That is where we are going.,159,,
1118,0.97,8960.518,8970.061,We also know a lot of the gig group that we have heard people about as the role of police and traffic.,159,,
1119,0.97,8970.061,8994.986,"The chief and--Inspector General Judge were already in conversation about that and have sort of Formerized with the director a process for how do we look at all the different ways that we use enforcement and education from the police side in--in collaboration with Sdot and their engineering and education and have to do traffic, pedestrian, commuter safety.",159,,
1120,0.97,8994.986,9007.765,"I think the traffic, how to handle all those traffic and moving violations will be handled in a very sort of Seattle way and understanding the nature of transportation this Seattle.",159,,
1121,0.97,9007.765,9015.373,"I think--long story short, is Nick Jr.--it is the abbreviation.",159,,
1122,0.97,9015.373,9017.875,It always clicks in my head.,159,,
1123,0.97,9017.875,9023.447,The National Institute gave us the frame work and pointed us--I think to Aspirational.,159,,
1124,0.97,9023.447,9030.187,They are pushing us sort of to what chief Scoggins said about the change team.,159,,
1125,0.97,9030.187,9037.128,"I think we see the high level, not knowing the leads.",159,,
1126,0.97,9037.128,9038.229,Lets consider each one of those.,159,,
1127,0.97,9038.229,9045.97,Lets look at what the law and labor tells us and see if it is possible because some of those will be and some of those won't be.,159,,
1128,0.97,9045.97,9049.54,We at the moment--the harder stuff is complicated.,159,,
1129,0.97,9049.54,9050.107,There are options there.,159,,
1130,0.97,9050.107,9068.859,"I think this gave us good frame work to continue to sort of group of calls by group of calls, group them, analyze them and figure out who is the best team to respond to it.",159,,
1131,0.97,9068.859,9069.927,Thank you Dr. Fisher.,160,,
1132,0.97,9069.927,9072.997,I notice screen keeps flipping back and forth.,160,,
1133,0.97,9072.997,9083.774,But it is great because the question I have is sort of related to information that is on slide seven as well as slide eight.,160,,
1134,0.97,9083.774,9094.985,I thought that the--that the critique that--of the Nick Jr.,160,,
1135,0.97,9094.985,9105.496,Report was interesting the critique was interesting because it is my understanding that the tier 1 analysis wasn't #1I78 plastic.,160,,
1136,0.97,9105.496,9111.068,It didn't--it wasn't just about the number of calls that fit into tier 1.,160,,
1137,0.97,9111.068,9126.917,It also did an analysis of the number of times that that--that those calls required some sort of follow up action by a police officer and found that that was a very low percentage of calls.,160,,
1138,0.97,9126.917,9130.654,So in my mind that is the risk analysis.,160,,
1139,0.97,9130.654,9132.056,It is not a simplistic analysis.,160,,
1140,0.97,9132.056,9139.763,It is a layered analysis that is actually looking at--possible harm.,160,,
1141,0.97,9139.763,9142.766,And that is specific to I think the tier 1 calls.,160,,
1142,0.97,9142.766,9151.775,I do have some questions about the numbers of tier 1 calls though.,160,,
1143,0.97,9151.775,9167.725,The recommendation is that in the near term SPD agrees that there are approximately 30 incident types where it is apparent that SPD does not need to be the primaries ponder if other resources are consistently available.,160,,
1144,0.97,9167.725,9173.664,This represents 12% of total calls and 6% of total officer hours.,160,,
1145,0.97,9173.664,9180.571,"As I understand the information on slide a, 12% of calls is about 144,000 calls.",160,,
1146,0.97,9180.571,9184.408,I'm assuming that is over the entire three year period of time.,160,,
1147,0.97,9184.408,9185.409,You correct.,161,,
1148,0.97,9185.409,9194.685,"That works out to be roughly an average of 48,000 calls a year.",162,,
1149,0.97,9194.685,9204.094,"Your recommendation to have triage 1 address a person down in welfare checks is only about 7,000 calls a year.",162,,
1150,0.97,9204.094,9244.802,"So given that the statement is that 12% of calls can handle a response that does not have SPD as primaries Ponser and if that 12% is 48,000 calls and we only have a proposal to deal with 7,000 calls, what is the executive's proposal for moving forward around that additional 40,000 calls a year that you--it sounds like you are saying that you agree would benefit from an alternate response to that of an officer?",162,,
1151,0.97,9244.802,9248.739,Chris did you want me to take that one?,163,,
1152,0.97,9248.739,9249.64,Thank you Council member.,163,,
1153,0.97,9249.64,9261.619,I think the short answer in a nutshell is that the try angle teams that proposal we put forward is the first step Esentally.,163,,
1154,0.97,9261.619,9266.757,We view that as low hanging fruit.,163,,
1155,0.97,9266.757,9280.07,"An area where we know these are sort of outside the body of work of the fire Department, outside the body of work of the police Department so we won't run into labor issues there with either one of them.",163,,
1156,0.97,9280.07,9285.075,Collaboratively with them on defining what those calls are.,163,,
1157,0.97,9285.075,9294.785,"And I think as I indicated at the beginning of the presentation, I think there are going to be several other types of response models that will be born out of the analysis.",163,,
1158,0.97,9294.785,9302.359,This is just the Firls of what we anticipate of being probably many that will fit into this category.,163,,
1159,0.97,9302.359,9304.928,I think that the short Sans we are not done.,163,,
1160,0.97,9304.928,9312.102,This proposal will not be the Pronl Posal.,163,,
1161,0.97,9312.102,9318.842,E--proposal.,163,,
1162,0.97,9318.842,9329.787,"Two of the other call types, littering, noise, they don't naturally into the triage 1 approach.",164,,
1163,0.97,9329.787,9334.158,It doesn't seem to call for an SPD officer.,164,,
1164,0.97,9334.158,9343.5,I just don't think we have thought about who that someone would be and where they would sit.,164,,
1165,0.97,9343.5,9356.013,"I think having a follow up conversation, what he meant was the initial cut that the National Institute did was looking at what is the call type and does it match up with the crime?",164,,
1166,0.97,9356.013,9357.715,That was level 1.,164,,
1167,0.97,9357.715,9373.297,They matched up every call type with whether it sounded like it matched up with an Rcw or Rcw is Misdemg Nors reflected there as well.,164,,
1168,0.97,9373.297,9376.734,"If it didn't, they naturally put it in tier 1.",164,,
1169,0.97,9376.734,9383.54,"If the officer didn't close the call out as a crime, it was likely to be a tier 1 call.",164,,
1170,0.97,9383.54,9394.218,We can get into there is many times are criminal behavior has occurred but with officer discretion they don't necessarily close it out as such.,164,,
1171,0.97,9394.218,9395.452,That is one issue.,164,,
1172,0.97,9395.452,9434.091,"It is more--they layered on but for whatever reason was someone arrested and I think both about the work that has been done broadly I our system--sort of across the country and in Seattle about trying to minimize on lower level stuff how often we are rest, I think the arrest part might be too narrow to make a decision--[Indiscernible] if there is a victim hurt or if something happens other than the arrest, it is some thing we need to consider.",164,,
1173,0.97,9434.091,9444.268,We will have to have the conversation about how do we score for lack of a better word the different factors in that risk model about--how chancy is this encounter.,164,,
1174,0.97,9444.268,9469.86,"That is the direction I believe he was pointing was just the weather the call type sounds like its connected to a crime and whether it was arrested might be leaving out other factors we might have more access to data that when we have H this initial engagement with the National Institute we didn't think about could we share that Dt with them, were they thinking about Conceptualizing that.",164,,
1175,0.97,9469.86,9474.231,That is our next step there.,164,,
1176,0.97,9474.231,9490.48,I was just saying that--it is my understanding from my review of the executive Summery that that next step has been done for the tier 1 calls because that is where you decided to focus.,165,,
1177,0.97,9490.48,9502.626,Are the tier 1 calls and you determined that is the place to focus because of what has happened at those calls when police have arrived.,165,,
1178,0.97,9502.626,9514.571,"That there is a doctor the data shows, the analysis shows that there is--there was not need for SPD follow up for a majority of the calls.",165,,
1179,0.97,9514.571,9522.312,It was--I don't have the percentage right in front of me but it was a very low percentage.,165,,
1180,0.97,9522.312,9527.15,The National Institute put 174 call types in tier 1.,166,,
1181,0.97,9527.15,9534.725,I think the slide has a Mistype for the final report we identified 30 of those 174.,166,,
1182,0.97,9534.725,9539.129,There are others is that may very well be tier 1.,166,,
1183,0.97,9539.129,9541.398,We want to consider other factors.,166,,
1184,0.97,9541.398,9542.799,That is very helpful.,167,,
1185,0.97,9542.799,9543.066,Thank you.,167,,
1186,0.97,9543.066,9543.3,Yeah.,168,,
1187,0.97,9543.3,9565.556,"Council member, I will add we have learned some great lessons from the health one implementation about the importance of Scaling these things up, too Chlt.",169,,
1188,0.97,9565.923,9574.331,We learn what we continue--don't know along the way as well.,169,,
1189,0.97,9574.331,9577.834,So that brings us--that is a great Segway.,170,,
1190,0.97,9577.834,9594.685,"Thank you, to discussing the new alternate response triage model proposal that they have worked on in conjunction with director Lombard and chief Scoggins and Jon Ehrenfeld from his team.",170,,
1191,0.97,9594.685,9600.357,We wanted to give you a quick over view of what that is.,170,,
1192,0.97,9600.357,9604.528,I know we have had a chance to bring some Council members on this to some extent.,170,,
1193,0.97,9604.528,9608.599,Welcome to the opportunity to put this out there again.,170,,
1194,0.97,9608.599,9621.678,"So again focussing on that 12% and the types of calls that were identified by the National Institute for criminal justice reform that are sort of right for diversion, we took a look at those.",170,,
1195,0.97,9621.678,9654.344,"We knew from our community outreach that people are supportive of developing alternate response models for Non-Criminal type crimes and we sort of were keeping an eye on the request for proposals on community safety capacity building as well and were aware there was no actual Turnkey as I said, immediate alternate response model for these types of calls.",170,,
1196,0.97,9654.344,9666.723,I was clear what we needed to do was start developing a model to try Orange and we use this word in the true sense of the term.,170,,
1197,0.97,9666.723,9671.261,Triage Non-Criminal and Non-Health emergency calls.,170,,
1198,0.97,9671.261,9674.498,I think our over arching--we have two considerations we were making here.,170,,
1199,0.97,9674.498,9680.27,The first was not making life more complicated for our 911 Dispatchers.,170,,
1200,0.97,9680.27,9696.219,I think we are very aware that giving them too many options or giving them too many choices to make in a very short time period they have to make decision on what to dispatch was something we wanted to avoid.,170,,
1201,0.97,9696.219,9736.159,The other context we had was 911 callers are making decisions on who to dispatch based on--[Indiscernible] what we thought might be very helpful was to develop a Mod that he will gave our 911 Dispatchers the ability to get eyes on and get more information before an ultimate decision who should be the secondary response handling the situation should be.,170,,
1202,0.97,9736.159,9739.096,We have an--Jon please feel free too weigh in on this as well.,170,,
1203,0.97,9739.096,9745.368,What we did here was put side by side the different types of response models that we have.,170,,
1204,0.97,9745.368,9762.652,"Again focused on these--what we call person down calls which just for everyone's information are the calls where you have someone from the community call in and say this person is laying thrown on the sidewalk, they appear to be breathing but can somebody come and deal with them.",170,,
1205,0.97,9762.652,9777.501,And then there is these welfare check calls which are generally along those lines as well or have people in some sort of altered mental state either because of drug use or mental health issues.,170,,
1206,0.97,9777.501,9783.006,They aren't posing an immediate risk to themselves or others but their behavior is concerning to someone in the community.,170,,
1207,0.97,9783.006,9787.677,So they call 911 and ask for that to be addressed as well.,170,,
1208,0.97,9787.677,9811.535,So we have--already at the Seattle fire Department our health 1 unit which has been successful which is--under the mobile integrated health team they deal with those crisis type calls where there is an actual health concern.,170,,
1209,0.97,9811.535,9819.075,"Depression, anxiety, Intoxication and chronic mental health that leads to--where there is a nexus of an actual physical health concern.",170,,
1210,0.97,9819.075,9824.181,They are primarily--they are not dispatched through 911.,170,,
1211,0.97,9824.181,9834.524,They are primarily dispatched through other means either the fire Department may call them out to address an individual at times the police may as well.,170,,
1212,0.97,9834.524,9845.869,They do follow up and short term care management for those folks who are experiencing health concerns related to their behavioral health issues.,170,,
1213,0.97,9845.869,9855.378,We have the Seattle police Department crisis response team which deals with the other end of the spectrum.,170,,
1214,0.97,9855.378,9867.657,Those high Acuti behavioral health incidents or issues where there is a threat of danger to either that person or someone else that is immediate or concerning.,170,,
1215,0.97,9867.657,9873.43,They are called upon by patrol and at times are dispatched also by 911 as well.,170,,
1216,0.97,9873.43,9887.077,"They are there to support SPD patrol and provide resources that appropriate resources when there is a crisis call, where there is a public safety cone certain.",170,,
1217,0.97,9887.077,9900.957,"They also do Dcr referrals, they do tailored response plans for individuals who are chronically having crisis issues that create public safety concerns and they are sort of mid level engagement.",170,,
1218,0.97,9900.957,9904.394,Those are two great level resources we already have in the city.,170,,
1219,0.97,9904.394,9908.431,There is this sort of gray area of calls that don't fit into either one of those.,170,,
1220,0.97,9908.431,9914.804,These are sort of these man down or person down calls and these welfare check calls.,170,,
1221,0.97,9914.804,9923.68,"In order for us to get a good understanding, I think everyone agreed you can't make that decision over the phone with a 911 dispatcher.",170,,
1222,0.97,9923.68,9935.492,They don't have the time and they don't have the ability offering up secondhand information to make a true tailored decision on who should be helping this individual.,170,,
1223,0.97,9935.492,9943.633,"So, that is where we see the triage model fitting in.",170,,
1224,0.97,9943.633,9944.1,Is chief Scoggins on?,170,,
1225,0.97,9944.1,9951.474,I just wanted to give him a chance to weigh in.,170,,
1226,0.97,9951.474,9951.708,Okay.,171,,
1227,0.97,9951.708,9982.739,On this slide I wanted to first mention my recollection of the report suggested that there was some data lacking as it relates to the dispatch of the SPD crisis response unit and then as it Relateses to the triage model and maybe also health one moving forward.,171,,
1228,0.97,9982.739,9997.253,I'm really trusted to know the thinking of how 988 would interact with these resources when it launches next year.,171,,
1229,0.97,9997.253,10034.357,It will be an alternative to 191 that focuses on helping crisis--[Indiscernible] so that is a question I have about 98.,171,,
1230,0.97,10034.357,10058.748,Flagging the lack of information as I understand it about the dispatch data for SPD's crisis response unit and also on slide 9 it States that the--that Hsd did not surface any proposals for our--community safety capacity building.,171,,
1231,0.97,10058.748,10065.789,Rfp did not surface proposals that could implement a community led emergency response in the near term.,171,,
1232,0.97,10065.789,10083.807,We don't need to have a discussion about an individual application but I do know there was at least one proposal to stand up a community safety Hub in North Seattle with the capability to dispatch around the clock seven days a week.,171,,
1233,0.97,10083.807,10088.278,"So, maybe we could at a later time return--return to that proposal.",171,,
1234,0.97,10088.278,10095.051,I don't think it is accurate say that there were no proposals to the most recent Rfp.,171,,
1235,0.97,10095.051,10103.56,With that I will just let you respond to one question I had here.,171,,
1236,0.97,10103.56,10105.895,That is how it will interact.,172,,
1237,0.97,10105.895,10108.064,I think it remains to be seen Council member.,172,,
1238,0.97,10108.064,10112.469,I don't want to punt it to director Lombard necessarily.,172,,
1239,0.97,10112.469,10116.005,I think first of all I think there are plenty of these types of calls to go around.,172,,
1240,0.97,10116.005,10129.352,"I don't have any idea or we don't have any information on how many teams they will have, or at least we don't have any information on how many teams they will have available for dispatch and through the 988 call number.",172,,
1241,0.97,10129.352,10149.539,I think it is safe to say that for the foreseeable future many of these calls are still going to be coming through 911 and we are still going to have the need to make a decision on what the appropriate response is and so we still see a need and a use for these particular models.,172,,
1242,0.97,10149.539,10153.91,"If once that is stood up and there is some redundancies there, we are calling this a pilot.",172,,
1243,0.97,10153.91,10156.112,We are seeing how it goes and learning from it.,172,,
1244,0.97,10156.112,10175.765,We will have the ability to make adjustments and that is part of the beauty of having it be a city program with city employees doing it at least initially.,172,,
1245,0.97,10175.765,10181.437,So anything to add to that director Lombard ton 988 question?,172,,
1246,0.97,10181.437,10190.346,The only thing I would add on that is that--for 30 years we have been conditioning the public that 911 is the number to call for all your problems.,173,,
1247,0.97,10190.346,10201.991,"Even though we have 811 before you dig and 311 for information in some communities, they still call 911 for questions, too.",173,,
1248,0.97,10201.991,10211.267,It is still going to be a long time before people stop calling 911 for their--for fix their problems.,173,,
1249,0.97,10211.267,10218.107,"And that is true, director Lombard with some portion--some demographic of the population.",174,,
1250,0.97,10218.107,10227.183,There is a demographic and I appreciate central staff highlighting this at the beginning of one of the things we learned from our call engagement.,174,,
1251,0.97,10227.183,10235.792,There is a demographic that does not call 911 and there is a demographic that is increasingly not calling 911.,174,,
1252,0.97,10235.792,10241.631,"I am increasingly getting feedback from members of the public who want an alternative, not theoretically.",174,,
1253,0.97,10241.631,10247.537,They have a--they have a situation and they want me to refer them to refer them to somebody who is not 911.,174,,
1254,0.97,10247.537,10253.243,I think that is really important to keep forefront in our mind.,174,,
1255,0.97,10253.243,10253.843,Yes.,175,,
1256,0.97,10253.843,10259.649,Can I jump in real quick on the slide?,176,,
1257,0.97,10259.649,10259.882,Yeah.,177,,
1258,0.97,10259.882,10274.597,"So Council member one thing would like to quickly call out because I think that there is a lot of teams out there, this does not include partners such as mobile crisis teams.",178,,
1259,0.97,10274.597,10275.765,There is a lot out there.,178,,
1260,0.97,10275.765,10284.04,I think that on the police side and the crisis response team and on our side of health one there are specialty units.,178,,
1261,0.97,10284.04,10290.38,They are able and willing to spend lengthy periods of time with these complex clients.,178,,
1262,0.97,10290.38,10295.051,I think we are very confident that is the way to go.,178,,
1263,0.97,10295.051,10301.524,We are a victim of our own success here.,178,,
1264,0.97,10301.524,10319.942,"The idea with these triage team as Julie mentioned is it will be a faster so they can process more of these calls, take more of a load off of SPD patrol operations which isn't to say it will just be a one and done.",178,,
1265,0.97,10320.243,10377.967,We looked at how often these calls come in and what time and I think folks knew in their head and it was good to see it play out in the data that it is really happening during the week a little bit lighter on the weekends but really Dir during the week from 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning till about 7:00 or 8:00 at night.,178,,
1266,0.97,10377.967,10387.677,"The densest part being the dark the color being around lunchtime, in the afternoon, running up to dinner.",178,,
1267,0.97,10387.677,10400.189,"Any person who looks at 911 data or listens to the live stream is when we have a lot of people out and about going to work, downtown for lunch, walking around.",178,,
1268,0.97,10400.189,10409.465,That is when they encounter the person who is down or when they go--someone doesn't show up to work and someone calls in and says can you do a welfare check.,178,,
1269,0.97,10409.465,10419.675,"This all makes sense but we saw it in the data about the when and the where, I think a lot of this is concentrated in the downtown core in terms of the volume.",178,,
1270,0.97,10419.675,10422.945,That is how most of our calls are concentrated.,178,,
1271,0.97,10422.945,10430.119,"If you do a heat map, there are more responses downtown.",178,,
1272,0.97,10430.119,10433.456,Specific call types will have densities elsewhere.,178,,
1273,0.97,10433.456,10456.145,"The volume of work downtown, especially post pan Cometic or Prepandemic always makes a density there and as we did look at most of these resulted in a final disposition of the--they rendered some assistance but nothing that necessarily met a criminal justice sort of assistance.",178,,
1274,0.97,10456.145,10459.315,They helped the person.,178,,
1275,0.97,10459.315,10461.184,Maybe they--had got them moving again.,178,,
1276,0.97,10461.184,10466.556,We would have to read all the comments to understand what the different types of assistance rendered was.,178,,
1277,0.97,10466.556,10483.239,This less than 10% was there anything where it seemed like it needed an officer and it says here only 2% was there an arrest for some reason and again it would take a review of the notes to understand the why of the arrest.,178,,
1278,0.97,10483.239,10489.745,Was it specific doing what happened there or was it found to some other reason this was somebody that folks were looking for?,178,,
1279,0.97,10489.745,10504.794,Maybe they had a warrant and they knew them but there could be multiple reasons about why an arrest occurred.,178,,
1280,0.97,10504.794,10521.077,Greet the staffing Instructure 1 we are trying to work Collaboratively with the unions that will bill be impacted by this new model.,179,,
1281,0.97,10521.077,10532.655,We do apt pate anticipate this will be a civilian forward response.,179,,
1282,0.97,10532.655,10541.731,"Crisis response, De-Escalation, Homelessnes outreach, chemical dependency to understand what is out there and what is the best secondary response to deal with the incident before them.",179,,
1283,0.97,10541.731,10561.017,"So we would need to make sure that there is going to be robust links but if all the existing resources that are out there--including the mobile crisis team t crisis response team, health 1, community service officers, it set have a.",179,,
1284,0.97,10561.017,10566.522,Then risk management purposes and the ability to be very flexible and nimble.,179,,
1285,0.97,10566.522,10576.532,City employees with future opportunities to incorporate community based partners Earther in secondary responses or part of the team as well.,179,,
1286,0.97,10576.532,10587.209,We are trying to work with the Union so we can come one a Mod that he will work--model that works for everybody and is safe for everybody.,179,,
1287,0.97,10587.209,10590.98,John Ehrenfeld do you want to take this one?,179,,
1288,0.97,10590.98,10591.247,Sure.,180,,
1289,0.97,10591.247,10596.619,"Um, so I think that--again right now how is this team Conceptionally going to differ?",180,,
1290,0.97,10596.619,10612.368,"I think that the idea--the ideal pipeline here will be from the Csct from the first time call out to the field allowing first line of dispatch to get eyes on and--you know, refer back as need be.",180,,
1291,0.97,10612.368,10619.775,I think we really see them as having that more immediate--to both police and fire operations.,180,,
1292,0.97,10619.775,10623.212,You know the--the triage will be the first thing.,180,,
1293,0.97,10623.212,10625.448,Is this immediately a criminal act?,180,,
1294,0.97,10625.448,10631.62,Is this someone in a medical emergency or is there some other undetermined need?,180,,
1295,0.97,10631.62,10639.428,I feel like our feeling is third category will be the greatest one.,180,,
1296,0.97,10639.428,10646.335,Regardless of how the call presented at 911 which is really a precise tool.,180,,
1297,0.97,10646.335,10662.451,What we have seen both on the health one front and also with crisis response team that the--our colleagues over there is you have to have some back end opportunities to do referrals.,180,,
1298,0.97,10662.451,10664.62,The system is extremely fragmented.,180,,
1299,0.97,10664.62,10672.862,"Physical health, behavioral health, substance use disorder, these take a long time.",180,,
1300,0.97,10672.862,10674.83,Pass them to.,180,,
1301,0.97,10674.83,10690.079,"On our end again, we are suggesting a similar approach here.",180,,
1302,0.97,10690.079,10694.05,I think you will have to been about that.,180,,
1303,0.97,10694.05,10697.353,I think we already talked about the hours of operation.,180,,
1304,0.97,10697.353,10708.564,Again this is kind of getting--[Indiscernible] this will be collaborative with the bargaining that is at operations.,180,,
1305,0.97,10708.564,10712.935,I think welfare check calls we have gone over already is it is a good way in.,180,,
1306,0.97,10712.935,10728.451,I think right now the feeling is that we have a really good index of suspicion as we would say in the medical community for these going the way we want them to in terms of being able to provide an effective response.,180,,
1307,0.97,10728.451,10733.823,.,180,,
1308,0.97,10733.823,10734.89,Thank you.,181,,
1309,0.97,10734.89,10737.493,I am going to need to wrap this up.,181,,
1310,0.97,10737.493,10737.993,My apologies.,181,,
1311,0.97,10737.993,10742.364,I see there are a couple of additional slides.,181,,
1312,0.97,10742.364,10748.771,A couple of us have another meeting starting up right now.,181,,
1313,0.97,10748.771,10758.013,I want to address a couple in closing a couple of the things on the additional slides.,181,,
1314,0.97,10758.013,10773.696,The bullets suggest that--the proposal would fund an it project to build out a criteria based dispatch system.,181,,
1315,0.97,10773.696,10778.167,It identifies the cost.,181,,
1316,0.97,10778.167,10783.639,I have been working on identifying a sooner opportunity to find this system.,181,,
1317,0.97,10783.639,10793.849,I do not believe we should wait until the passage of the 2022 budget in order to fund the system.,181,,
1318,0.97,10793.849,10808.931,It is clear this system needs to be in place and there needs to be training on the system before you stand up the triage 1 program.,181,,
1319,0.97,10808.931,10838.494,I have an amendment that has been--[Indiscernible] also want to flag I think on the final slide similarly within the supplemental really appreciate receiving new recommendation from SPD.,181,,
1320,0.97,10838.494,10857.012,"To front load $500,000 of that investment in the conversations around the head quarter supplemental that we are in right now.",181,,
1321,0.97,10857.012,10857.413,I support that.,181,,
1322,0.97,10857.413,10860.349,We will also have an amendment to address that as well.,181,,
1323,0.97,10860.349,10869.558,As it relate to the community service officer expansion I think we will need to talk to the other Council members about this.,181,,
1324,0.97,10869.558,10878.701,I had a proposal to fill the vacant positions during our earlier SPD budget discussions.,181,,
1325,0.97,10878.701,10892.548,I still absolutely support funding those vacant positions and intend to propose an amendment to the budget to do so next week.,181,,
1326,0.97,10892.548,10908.897,As far as future additional expansion beyond filling those spots in this year I'm just looking forward to talking more with my colleagues on the council as well as SPD on that majority.,181,,
1327,0.97,10908.897,10924.68,Again really excited to know that the Council's funding for the health 1 expansion to add to the Mayor's funding for the health one expansion that already happened that we are going to be able to have another expansion in quarter 4.,181,,
1328,0.97,10924.68,10940.396,Before--sorry that we are rushing to get through this last bit before we end this item are there other comments in closing from either Presenters or Council members?,181,,
1329,0.97,10940.396,10944.733,"Just to thank you for letting us come and present at the committee, council member.",182,,
1330,0.97,10944.733,10950.539,I know there will be a lot of questions about the data from the National Institute of criminal justice reform.,182,,
1331,0.97,10950.539,10958.047,We are happy to set up a briefing to do a data deep Dave with either central staff or Whomever if that will be helpful.,182,,
1332,0.97,10958.047,10959.315,Thank you very much.,183,,
1333,0.97,10959.315,10964.353,You know we have been very excited and eager to get this information.,183,,
1334,0.97,10964.353,10972.795,Definitely look forward to having the opportunity to more.,183,,
1335,0.97,10972.795,10978.634,So--with that next public safety and human services committee is scheduled for August 10th.,183,,
1336,0.97,10978.634,10982.538,Before we adjourn are there any other comments from my colleagues?,183,,
1337,0.97,10982.538,10984.84,Hearing none.,183,,
1338,0.97,10984.84,10986.208,The time is 12:34 P.M.,183,,
1339,0.97,10986.208,10991.814,Thank you for staying long with us today and we are adjourned.,183,,
