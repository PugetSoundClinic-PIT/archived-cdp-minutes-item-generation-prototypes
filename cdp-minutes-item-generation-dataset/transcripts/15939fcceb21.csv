151,0.97,724.09,725.558,It was designed to create a strategic plan.,35,,
152,0.97,725.558,730.196,"The strategic plan is for the entire work of parks and recreation, not just the park district.",35,,
153,0.97,730.196,733.199,Important to note that.,35,,
154,0.97,733.199,746.612,This was to provide us with clear policy direction for our work over the next 12 years is the time horizon we selected.,35,,
155,0.97,746.612,752.918,"The reason we selected 12 years is we really want to think more long-term obviously about the work we are doing, but it also Aligns with several other planning processes in place.",35,,

162,0.97,796.829,799.632,"As you recall, the park district is just a portion of everything we do.",37,,
163,0.97,799.632,800.566,This planning is for everything.,37,,
164,0.97,800.566,802.668,But we want to align obviously with the park district.,37,,
165,0.97,802.668,803.869,That is why it is 12 years.,37,,
166,0.97,803.869,809.575,We have two six-year cycles within that.,37,,
167,0.97,809.575,810.176,Thank you.,38,,
168,0.97,810.176,818.651,"The first slide, and these are actual components from the strategic plan that we will get to you as soon as it is done, but is anchored really in this organizational framework with our vision, values admission.",39,,
169,0.97,818.651,826.525,"Really focused on the three categories, healthy people, healthy environment, strong communities.",39,,
170,0.97,826.525,828.027,I will go into these in more detail.,39,,
171,0.97,828.027,833.165,We added a fourth pillar that is around organizational excellence and making sure we continually strive to do the best work we can possibly do.,39,,
172,0.97,833.165,837.002,And the other piece I will highlight that we added as part of the strategic plan speaks to equity.,39,,
173,0.97,837.002,845.978,We created a Pathway to equity that touches on all of these pillars and Articulates the way we will continue to focus our commitment on equity in the work we do.,39,,
174,0.97,845.978,850.416,Some of the information on the slide really makes it pretty clear about why we are planning.,39,,
175,0.97,850.416,854.286,The city of Seattle has changed dramatically and continues to change.,39,,
176,0.97,854.286,877.977,"We know that for example since our last plan, the legacy plan Pileated that it led to the creation of the park district and 2015, the population has grown by over 100,000 residents, which is actually almost surpassing the original twenty-year production projection.",39,,
177,0.97,877.977,879.645,We have done that in the first five years.,39,,
178,0.97,879.645,888.02,"As we were going through the plan it was projected within the 12 year horizon for our plan, they expect another 50,000 residents to move into the city.",39,,
179,0.97,888.02,895.227,"Again, we can see that some of that might even be going further than that.",39,,
180,0.97,895.227,908.274,"In addition to the gross, there are other challenges that we feel like it is our responsibility as we serve the residents of the city to make sure we're responsive to these things.",39,,
181,0.97,908.274,915.848,"Including the population growth, tremendous drop growth, and also this growing wealth gap that really faces the residents we serve.",39,,
182,0.97,915.848,917.683,Can I slow you down for a minute?,40,,
183,0.97,917.683,922.354,"On the support solutions, is that where you're plugging in the homelessness issue?",40,,
184,0.97,922.354,932.298,Exactly.,41,,
185,0.97,932.298,934.9,"The bullet at the bottom is the principles, the Foundational principles for planning.",41,,
186,0.97,934.9,943.275,We went out and met with folks during the planning process and anchored the conversation in these concepts.,41,,
187,0.97,943.275,948.714,"So that folks know this is what we're looking at and thinking about as we do our planning, and we hope folks think about them as well.",41,,
188,0.97,948.714,954.62,"Certainly the supporting solutions to citywide challenges is about the fact that even though we have a clear mission, we also don't work in isolation in the city.",41,,
189,0.97,954.62,955.421,We are part of that.,41,,
190,0.97,955.421,964.063,"My concern is if we are going to have a bullet point for climate change, which is way out there too, that maybe we have a bullet point and make that an actual line item, the homelessness issue.",42,,
191,0.97,964.063,972.504,"Because that comes up for parks whether we are talking in cabins, Encampments, response with the snow.",42,,
192,0.97,972.504,977.743,"At least for this counsel that, I know this will come up again in budget.",42,,
193,0.97,977.743,980.446,Sanitary purposes.,42,,
194,0.97,980.446,985.718,We have 27 community centers --,42,,
195,0.97,985.718,986.118,26.,43,,
196,0.97,986.118,986.952,And 27 parks?,44,,
197,0.97,986.952,997.196,480 parks.,45,,
198,0.97,997.329,998.263,Over 480 individual parks.,45,,
199,0.97,998.263,1000.933,I would like to see that as a bullet point to respond to.,46,,
200,0.97,1000.933,1002.568,Not as a side NOTE if you well.,46,,
201,0.97,1002.568,1006.238,I apologize for not framing this conversation appropriately.,47,,
202,0.97,1006.238,1017.049,What I'm hoping to do is walk you through the process we have gone through and then I will share some of the strategies we have identified as part of the process.,47,,
203,0.97,1017.049,1030.062,Those strategies are still high enough level and we are in the middle now of meeting with all the divisions to create Workplan items that are driven by these strategies.,47,,
204,0.97,1030.062,1036.902,"For example, as we are doing our planning, understanding we are part of citywide solutions including homelessness of course, but for example preschool and Childcare and other things that fall into this.",47,,
205,0.97,1036.902,1045.611,"Supporting education, supporting health and things like that.",47,,
206,0.97,1045.611,1047.88,All of those he will see as we go through this.,47,,
207,0.97,1047.88,1050.416,Hopefully you will find all of those incorporated in the strategies.,47,,
208,0.97,1050.416,1057.523,"When we do our Workplan items from these, there are very specific items for example in our financial plan around things like navigation, things like Referenced rooms Restrooms.",47,,
209,0.97,1057.523,1058.657,This is what guides us.,47,,
210,0.97,1058.657,1084.65,"The purposes of community and what we've been hearing and certainly from this Council is that even though you have a 12 year horizon, every six your spending plan coming up, and in the spending plan those are going to be some of the meat and potatoes on what the budget is going to be asking for.",48,,
211,0.97,1084.65,1086.085,I'm just putting that out there now.,48,,
212,0.97,1086.085,1086.518,Absolutely.,49,,
213,0.97,1086.518,1086.852,For sure.,49,,
214,0.97,1086.852,1098.43,"A couple other things we remind people as we think about that is that for example, even though we build and improve and maintain and activate spaces and buildings, we do that to serve the needs of the residents.",49,,
215,0.97,1098.43,1100.466,We have to be aware of what those needs are.,49,,
216,0.97,1100.466,1113.479,We do it with equity at the forefront and understanding we are serving the populations that have been Mis-Served.,49,,
217,0.97,1113.479,1114.813,We're looking to serve them first.,49,,
218,0.97,1114.813,1122.688,"We also big about the fact that all of the things, the way we have done things of the past aren't necessarily the ways we need to do them now and in the future because the world has changed.",49,,
219,0.97,1122.688,1126.291,We have to retrain ourselves and set expectations in the community about how we do our work.,49,,
220,0.97,1126.291,1127.326,"A couple of others, climate change.",49,,
221,0.97,1127.326,1137.669,"You will see that throughout the plan as well, very specific items that respond to the idea that because of our Footprint in the city and the connection we have to residents in terms of education, we absolutely have to make sure the climate changes at the forefront for us.",49,,
222,0.97,1137.669,1138.47,Already mitigating those changes.,49,,
223,0.97,1138.47,1152.451,"And in the last one on excellent service, making sure we have the capacity to do the work we are being charged to do.",49,,
224,0.97,1155.988,1156.922,I will go through these.,49,,
225,0.97,1156.922,1166.832,"I mentioned in addition to the pillars of healthy people, healthy Averment, strong communities and organizational excellence, we also created a new Pathway to equity that understands that we are still learning, still growing but making sure every aspect of what we do is anchored in equity.",49,,
226,0.97,1166.832,1170.736,We understand that we play a role as an institution that is art of the systemic racism.,49,,
227,0.97,1170.736,1178.243,We have a responsibility to undo that in the work we do.,49,,
228,0.97,1178.243,1181.947,"So as we go through the planning and the articulation of these initiatives, we are Rethinking our engagement.",49,,
229,0.97,1181.947,1191.056,"For example, our oversight committee will have some guidance through an equity scorecard and framework driven by the communities that need the most first.",49,,
230,0.97,1191.056,1200.866,And then we are committed to making sure our staff is trained and understands the issues.,49,,
231,0.97,1200.866,1204.87,"Really playing out in everything we do, every policy, every program, every investment we do.",49,,
232,0.97,1204.87,1208.473,"So as we go through these, I will try to go through these relatively quickly.",49,,
233,0.97,1208.473,1212.11,We framed these four basic pillars.,49,,
234,0.97,1212.11,1213.145,We established a vision.,49,,
235,0.97,1213.145,1223.989,"So for healthy people, we envision a city, parks and recreation agency where the folks that we interact with have access to recreation.",49,,
236,0.97,1223.989,1225.891,That they feel safe and connected and active.,49,,
237,0.97,1225.891,1231.496,That they participate in programs that help them build healthy habits.,49,,
238,0.97,1231.496,1241.873,"Of course there able to do it and parks designed to help them feel included, well-designed Well-Maintained and connected.",49,,
239,0.97,1241.873,1242.708,This is for all people.,49,,
240,0.97,1242.708,1247.98,"Notice we don't talk about specific populations, this is for all the work we do driven by this vision.",49,,
241,0.97,1247.98,1251.216,We created strategies of the come from that vision.,49,,
242,0.97,1251.216,1267.766,"So for healthy people, some of the strategies we are going to build Workplan items around is focusing on equitable and healthy programs, again, for all folks.",49,,
243,0.97,1267.766,1268.734,Increasing accessibility and Affordability.,49,,
244,0.97,1268.734,1269.935,Maintaining the high quality system of spaces.,49,,
245,0.97,1269.935,1275.34,I will highlight a few of them.,49,,
246,0.97,1275.34,1283.315,We heard for example even in the meeting last night how it is really important to enhance the awareness around what we offer to our communities and how they can participate and engage in tell us what they need.,49,,
247,0.97,1283.315,1284.449,Really connecting people to nature.,49,,
248,0.97,1284.449,1288.954,One of the public Testimonies today talked about community centers and how many hours.,49,,
249,0.97,1288.954,1297.729,We're really looking at Rethinking our communities for the needs of the residents and doing it in a way that respond to the growth.,49,,
250,0.97,1297.729,1303.869,Hold on a moment.,50,,
251,0.97,1303.869,1306.305,What do you mean when you say Rethinking the community center model?,51,,
252,0.97,1306.305,1307.673,A couple of things.,52,,
253,0.97,1307.673,1319.351,The broad vision is that we have 26 community centers.,52,,
254,0.97,1320.519,1322.22,It is difficult to add more community centers.,52,,
255,0.97,1322.22,1324.99,"Although we are adding one in Mercer, but those don't come very often.",52,,
256,0.97,1324.99,1335.767,"We have to rethink the way we program these community centers, making sure every community has a certain level of service where we provide programming and hours transparent, that everybody has a basic level of service.",52,,
257,0.97,1335.767,1339.771,We want to do it in a way that those hours are at a time when residents can use them.,52,,
258,0.97,1339.838,1341.907,O on the weekends and Eveni and things like that.,52,,
259,0.97,1341.907,1354.186,"We also want to understand that, want to shift the fact that recreation doesn't just happen in the community centers, it can happen in the parks adjacent or other parks and open spaces around those.",52,,
260,0.97,1354.186,1361.293,"Really it is the stool approach to standardizing the hours of operation, but really think about what we are offering and where we are offering it.",52,,
261,0.97,1361.293,1374.306,"As we dig more into this, we also understand that it is impossible for us to provide every single recreational program in every single community center that everybody wants.",52,,
262,0.97,1374.306,1393.759,"So we will focus on a core service that we offer and select, the capacity to create these hubs that have additional programming the folks--if they want their regular programming, they will go to the one they normally go to, but then they can go to a Hub if they wanted that programming but",52,,
263,0.97,1393.759,1396.027,That is not a programming approach we currently use?,53,,
264,0.97,1396.027,1398.363,They don't all have a certain basic level of service?,53,,
265,0.97,1398.363,1404.169,It is not standardized.,54,,
266,0.97,1404.169,1422.454,"We have various tiers of community centers in terms of the hours, and we have created a system Unfortunately where communities that have, that have more resources to pay for programming have more programs because it is a pay for play model.",54,,
267,0.97,1422.454,1430.295,We also have other situations where communities who have resources can pay for building monitor for example to add hours to the community center.,54,,
268,0.97,1430.295,1441.506,"I think those were was acceptable responses, but I think we need to move beyond that and standardize . We start with sort of an equal playing field and then enhance as necessary.",54,,
269,0.97,1441.506,1448.613,Quick question.,55,,
270,0.97,1448.613,1450.215,Hp 9. what does hp stand for?,55,,
271,0.97,1450.215,1452.083,For healthy people strategy number nine.,55,,
272,0.97,1452.083,1462.427,Why do you have grown richer healthy food?,56,,
273,0.97,1462.427,1465.13,We work with the Department of neighborhoods with the P patch program.,57,,
274,0.97,1465.13,1467.599,We have some on her property and also have the food programs.,57,,
275,0.97,1467.599,1474.439,We have a lot of mainly educational programs and some of her community centers were staff work with participants on growing and preparing healthy food.,57,,
276,0.97,1474.439,1475.04,"More preparation, though.",58,,
277,0.97,1475.04,1475.44,Yes.,59,,
278,0.97,1475.44,1482.747,We also have orchards and produced many pounds of apples and other things pick,60,,
279,0.97,1482.747,1483.348,We have orchards?,61,,
280,0.97,1483.348,1487.352,I did not know that.,61,,
281,0.97,1487.352,1497.963,"We do a lot, very broad portfolio.",62,,
282,0.97,1497.963,1499.764,"Moving on to the second pillar, healthy environment.",62,,
283,0.97,1499.764,1512.777,"Our vision here is parks and recreation system that supports a thriving Ecosystem, continues to support a healthy urban forest, resilient green infrastructure in the work we do.",62,,
284,0.97,1512.777,1524.689,That we move to become carbon neutral and on our educational programming continuing to push the idea of Sustainability and mitigating climate change.,62,,
285,0.97,1524.689,1529.528,Also we think it is important to contribute as much as we can to a healthy Marine environment.,62,,
286,0.97,1529.528,1537.602,And then we heard this a lot during the engagement about the balance between passive recreation spaces as well as active.,62,,
287,0.97,1537.602,1541.339,People want to be out and be able to also appreciate the passive side of things.,62,,
288,0.97,1541.339,1546.111,You had your hand up.,63,,
289,0.97,1546.111,1547.012,Are you sure?,63,,
290,0.97,1547.012,1556.855,That was a vision for healthy environment and some of the strategies we selected here in terms of we are going to be working on.,64,,
291,0.97,1556.855,1567.999,Continuing to Steward our water and urban forest . really work to reduce our carbon Footprint and obviously complying with the Mayor is green new deal executive order.,64,,
292,0.97,1567.999,1570.835,And really we want to be a leader on change mitigation.,64,,
293,0.97,1570.835,1581.246,The question again.,65,,
294,0.97,1583.582,1587.552,"How is parks, what is your participation in the Mayor and city council new green new deal Commission and all that?",65,,
295,0.97,1587.552,1589.22,What kind of role are you playing?,65,,
296,0.97,1589.22,1590.021,A couple things.,66,,
297,0.97,1590.021,1599.564,The Office of Sustainability and the environment is creating a sub cap system that we will participate in.,66,,
298,0.97,1599.564,1600.565,We will participate in that.,66,,
299,0.97,1600.565,1624.189,"And then specific to the things in the green new deal, we are doing it and figuring out what it will take for any new building or substantially renovated building to make sure that we are Compliant with that in terms of being carbon neutral.",66,,
300,0.97,1624.189,1627.258,We have some opportunities like Lake city and green Lake in the pipeline and also others.,66,,
301,0.97,1627.258,1630.061,So we want to build green and we're not using natural gas?,67,,
302,0.97,1630.061,1630.862,That is correct.,68,,
303,0.97,1630.862,1631.663,We do have some challenges.,68,,
304,0.97,1631.663,1635.5,The swimming pools for example are tremendously inefficient and use a lot of energy.,68,,
305,0.97,1635.5,1639.204,Those are sort of opportunities for us as we think about the planning cycle to address those.,68,,
306,0.97,1639.204,1642.007,I have Councilperson Mosqeda and then Councilperson Sawant.,69,,
307,0.97,1642.007,1644.809,Thank you.,70,,
308,0.97,1644.809,1662.394,"As somebody who is an active Soccer Player, I know you went through a big process to try to convert all of our old dirt and sand fields to the rubber chips.",70,,
309,0.97,1662.394,1663.128,Yes.,71,,
310,0.97,1663.128,1666.598,Astroturf.,72,,
311,0.97,1666.598,1671.102,Are we monitoring the runoff from those fields as well given the rubber that is used?,72,,
312,0.97,1671.102,1683.181,A couple of studies have been done looking at the conditions on all of our fields for grass and the synthetic turf.,73,,
313,0.97,1683.181,1693.425,"We are currently looking at, we looked at a pilot project using new material, Couric instead of the rubber.",73,,
314,0.97,1693.425,1700.532,We were able to see from the baseline from the year before it was built what the environmental conditions were.,73,,
315,0.97,1700.532,1702.801,Then we changed and look at them afterwards and things are better.,73,,
316,0.97,1702.801,1704.002,Things are better with court?,74,,
317,0.97,1704.002,1704.836,Yes.,75,,
318,0.97,1704.836,1712.777,Is it something you all are recommending we transition away from the rubber Astrotur to court?,76,,
319,0.97,1712.777,1713.078,Yes.,77,,
320,0.97,1713.078,1722.654,Right now we are approaching it as we renovate them.,77,,
321,0.97,1722.654,1726.391,About every 10 years we will be going through them and replacing it with a different kind of material.,77,,
322,0.97,1726.391,1727.792,Is an urgent situation?,78,,
323,0.97,1727.792,1731.796,None of the data we have seen is recommending we move to that.,79,,
324,0.97,1731.796,1740.672,"We decided even though there is an sort of any data that clearly says that we should not be doing this, we are moving away from that anyway.",79,,
325,0.97,1740.672,1748.68,Any new field will you something different anytime we replace the carpets we will use a different material.,79,,
326,0.97,1748.68,1762.927,"I am thinking about the field next to my house, which is right next to the park where we have salmon . Longfellow Creek.",80,,
327,0.97,1762.927,1766.331,Right next to the creek.,80,,
328,0.97,1766.331,1779.878,I want to make sure that we are not doing anything to harm the salmon.,80,,
329,0.97,1780.011,1782.113,The second question I have is related to environmental protections.,80,,
330,0.97,1782.113,1785.85,We know there is a number of parks throughout the city the have committed to having pesticide free parks.,80,,
331,0.97,1785.85,1789.254,"I know there has been a number of concerns, especially up in the District of Councilmember Sawant.",80,,
332,0.97,1789.254,1796.161,The park on Capitol Hill is supposed to be pesticide free.,80,,
333,0.97,1796.161,1806.638,When I did a tour with some of the folks who work in that affordable housing there they had concerns about how it was being maintained whether or not pesticides free chemicals were being used.,80,,
334,0.97,1806.638,1807.772,Can you give us an update?,80,,
335,0.97,1807.772,1808.173,Sure.,81,,
336,0.97,1808.173,1810.208,The Agencywide commitment is to move away from any glycosides.,81,,
337,0.97,1810.208,1823.588,We also work with the working group around--I am spacing out in the name of this group.,81,,
338,0.97,1823.588,1826.057,It is about the city zone work around pesticides and other chemicals.,81,,
339,0.97,1826.057,1833.631,"Any time there is a decision or proposal to use pesticides, we go before that group and seek an exemption.",81,,
340,0.97,1833.631,1837.569,Moving forward--like a say.,81,,
341,0.97,1837.569,1839.103,The roundup essentially.,81,,
342,0.97,1839.103,1860.391,I think the fact that the city has a virtual ban on glycosides is a little bit different than the maybe more Aspirational goal of expanding that to other pesticides.,82,,
343,0.97,1860.391,1876.04,"And for instance, I know that there is the interest in moving some of our golf courses to the, I think it is the Audubon model of golf courses.",82,,
344,0.97,1876.04,1881.312,It is more expansive than just being about pesticides.,82,,
345,0.97,1881.312,1895.159,"It is about water use, and other asset management principles that are considered green principles.",82,,
346,0.97,1895.159,1905.27,"Along those same lines, and this might be something that has already been done and is no longer an issue.",82,,
347,0.97,1905.27,1917.982,But I seem to recall there is also an effort to move away from gas powered engines as it relates specifically to the equipment that the parks Department uses to maintain park property.,82,,
348,0.97,1917.982,1921.753,Just wondering where that is at.,82,,
349,0.97,1921.753,1923.154,We're definitely working on that.,83,,
350,0.97,1923.154,1927.792,We are doing piloting and trying to understand.,83,,
351,0.97,1927.792,1933.097,"When we first started thinking about it, our concern was that the equipment that was available wasn't quite enough for commercial use.",83,,
352,0.97,1933.097,1935.967,"It is okay for residential use, but not for the eight hour shifts.",83,,
353,0.97,1935.967,1937.368,That has gotten better.,83,,
354,0.97,1937.368,1943.775,"I am also happy to report that for example as we Rollout the maintenance plan, the waterfront park will be all Electric.",83,,
355,0.97,1943.775,1947.211,We are working to do much more of that as opportunities arise.,83,,
356,0.97,1947.211,1957.822,"It is great that that is the commitment for the waterfront Park, but is there a goal and Timeline for the entire parks system?",84,,
357,0.97,1957.822,1974.038,"There is a goal to move away on the small engines, the Blowers and things like that.",85,,
358,0.97,1981.512,1985.116,So we are Piloting that now and we're trying to understand what it will take to move to that.,85,,
359,0.97,1985.116,1990.922,Part of it is getting the right equipment and part is making sure there's the right infrastructure at the park so things can get plugged in and charge.,85,,
360,0.97,1990.922,1993.224,"I do have a Timeline at, but we're moving pretty aggressively.",85,,
361,0.97,1993.224,1995.259,It is part of the green new deal order as well.,85,,
362,0.97,1995.259,1996.461,We have many vehicles as well.,85,,
363,0.97,1996.461,2003.668,We are looking to Electrify as many of those looking at our operations to make sure we reduce the miles of trucks needs to drive.,85,,
364,0.97,2003.668,2010.274,,86,,
365,0.97,2010.274,2018.449,Are we using great water on golf courses and Soccer fields?,87,,
366,0.97,2018.449,2020.284,I am not sure the answer to that question.,88,,
367,0.97,2020.284,2021.853,I don't think we are.,88,,
368,0.97,2021.853,2023.254,On fields.,89,,
369,0.97,2023.254,2035.7,We need the irrigation question answer.,90,,
370,0.97,2035.7,2041.172,"Eiler before with Councilmember Juarez when we were looking at the industrial, business and individual home models how much electricity is used.",90,,
371,0.97,2041.172,2044.308,"I remember when Seattle city light came they broke down how much industrial, business and commercial.",90,,
372,0.97,2044.308,2057.221,This is how much--was is it for homes?,90,,
373,0.97,2057.221,2057.655,Residential.,90,,
374,0.97,2057.655,2058.823,To we have a number for parks?,90,,
375,0.97,2058.823,2061.292,I don't have it off the top of my head.,91,,
376,0.97,2061.292,2064.929,We have lots of data on the usage across buildings both from the electrical side as well as water.,91,,
377,0.97,2064.929,2068.332,"I get these charts and graphs on a regular basis, but I don't have those numbers.",91,,
378,0.97,2068.332,2071.269,"Can we get approximation on that, particularly when we started before the budget cycle?",92,,
379,0.97,2071.269,2071.836,Sure.,93,,
380,0.97,2071.836,2073.638,If we can be more efficient that is great.,94,,
381,0.97,2073.638,2075.706,I do have a baseline to work from.,94,,
382,0.97,2075.706,2076.107,Yes.,95,,
383,0.97,2076.107,2082.613,"I should've brought this up a while ago, but it kept slipping my mind.",96,,
384,0.97,2082.613,2083.848,Councilmember Herbold brought it to my attention.,96,,
385,0.97,2083.848,2087.151,Part of it is why it is important to move toward shifting these older buildings.,97,,
386,0.97,2087.151,2088.853,We have older buildings that are not efficient.,97,,
387,0.97,2088.853,2094.659,"Our pools are significantly old . So yes, the efficiency is not where we wanted.",97,,
388,0.97,2094.659,2109.974,"That is the perennial issue we come back to my constituents and my Collies come forward, we have a lot of buildings that are inefficient in energy and use, and we have a lot of buildings that are just need to be Retrofitted.",98,,
389,0.97,2109.974,2122.787,"The Brick-And-Mortar piece, we can't keep throwing good money, I don't know the saying, we can't be throwing money at stuff that doesn't work anymore.",98,,
390,0.97,2122.787,2126.123,If it were up to me I would bulldoze it all and build all branded stuff.,98,,
391,0.97,2126.123,2136.601,I like to build big stuff.,98,,
392,0.97,2136.601,2137.668,They won't let me.,98,,
393,0.97,2137.668,2140.171,That is why I'm trying to get a baseline well before budget.,98,,
394,0.97,2140.171,2141.839,I actually have spoken to the executive about this.,98,,
395,0.97,2141.839,2143.908,"I'm going to give you, we have had these conversations.",98,,
396,0.97,2143.908,2145.576,What I'm sharing is not completely brand new.,98,,
397,0.97,2145.576,2149.814,"But we have never gotten they grasp from parks just on the Brick-And-Mortar that we own, including golf courses and field.",98,,
398,0.97,2149.814,2155.319,"How much of it is, how green if we had a spectrum.",98,,
399,0.97,2155.319,2157.722,We don't have that.,98,,
400,0.97,2157.722,2170.735,"If we can start looking at that and maybe that is part of our six year planning, maybe that can become a piece of that.",98,,
401,0.97,2170.735,2172.336,A data point that you report on to us.,98,,
402,0.97,2172.336,2184.248,"Particularly now that we are in districts and people want to know how many community centers are in their district, how many parks, what is efficient and what is not because a lot of times we have to tell people no.",98,,
403,0.97,2184.248,2187.752,It is hard to say yes or no when I don't have a lot of information.,98,,
404,0.97,2187.752,2188.653,We're happy to provide that.,99,,
405,0.97,2188.653,2189.42,Thank you.,100,,
406,0.97,2189.42,2201.432,I'm going to raise this in the healthy environment section because I think it can fit nicely in there.,100,,
407,0.97,2201.432,2202.633,We mentioned golf courses already.,100,,
408,0.97,2202.633,2205.87,There are number of questions I know community members have about the use of golf courses.,100,,
409,0.97,2205.87,2218.583,I will direct this to trying to expand how we increase the Publics use of the space.,100,,
410,0.97,2218.749,2222.653,"Chambers Bay allows for people to walk around the golf course and use as a running facility, walking facility.",100,,
411,0.97,2222.653,2229.36,I'm going to set aside the question about whether or not more of the land that is currently used for golf courses should be used for things like affordable housing and Childcare.,100,,
412,0.97,2229.36,2230.094,I will put that aside.,100,,
413,0.97,2230.094,2234.365,"I will now say of the land currently being used, we already have paths that are embedded into our golf courses.",100,,
414,0.97,2234.365,2239.403,"It would be wonderful if we had not fences, but doors that allow for people to come in and walk around the facilities.",100,,
415,0.97,2239.403,2252.817,There is a golf course right behind my new house and I can see the path in the trees and the green space.,100,,
416,0.97,2252.817,2253.818,I can't get to it.,100,,
417,0.97,2253.818,2255.953,So what has the conversation been about opening those golf courses?,100,,
418,0.97,2255.953,2262.46,I understand there is a liability question that would be raised about golf balls hitting people on the head or something.,100,,
419,0.97,2262.46,2264.595,"But of chambers Bay can figure it out, what have we done?",100,,
420,0.97,2264.595,2271.135,That is an issue that we also are very focused on in diversifying activities.,101,,
421,0.97,2271.135,2273.337,"Walking, disc golf, track meets with the state and things like that.",101,,
422,0.97,2273.337,2278.342,But we need to do a better job of balancing the regular golf operations with additional activities.,101,,
423,0.97,2278.342,2279.844,That is something we are looking at.,101,,
424,0.97,2279.844,2285.716,"When you say we need to do a better job, how do we do that?",102,,
425,0.97,2285.716,2297.662,The community in the junction has really wanted to have more multiple uses for very long time.,103,,
426,0.97,2297.662,2306.57,"You know how frustrated they are the back off course counts as, again, as their open space anytime we talk about adding new open space to that neighborhood.",103,,
427,0.97,2306.57,2318.382,"People point to the golf course and say that is your share and accounts against, puts you lower on the list of priorities of other communities who also deservedly need open space.",103,,
428,0.97,2318.382,2325.756,We can't have it both ways.,103,,
429,0.97,2325.756,2332.863,"It can't be an exclusive use for golf, and we still tell the community we can't consider other Multiuse open spaces.",103,,
430,0.97,2332.863,2335.166,We need to figure out ways to make that space Multiuse.,103,,
431,0.97,2335.166,2343.407,I agree.,104,,
432,0.97,2343.407,2359.19,"This might be a frustrating answer, but part of the challenges that, and we have done a couple of studies to get at that answer because Unfortunately a lot of this is driven by finances and the model we created for golf and expecting to pay back some of the debts and looking at the very specific models.",104,,
433,0.97,2359.19,2378.943,Some of that we actually are required by counsel action to do certain fiscal policies that make it harder for us to bring in activities that our meeting revenue goals.,104,,
434,0.97,2378.943,2382.213,So part of what we're doing is thinking about how we pilot some of those things.,104,,
435,0.97,2382.213,2388.619,We understand what we can do and then come back to counsel and Chase those policies so we are not as reliant on having to operate under a certain fiscal model.,104,,
436,0.97,2388.619,2390.154,And so that is part of the process.,104,,
437,0.97,2390.154,2396.26,"And then just working with the operators of the golf courses to make sure we can find the right--because there talk about liability, how do we do that.",104,,
438,0.97,2396.26,2405.836,"It is driven a lot by the financing model, but we want to pilot some things to get away from that model so we can do more.",104,,
439,0.97,2405.836,2409.039,Thank you.,105,,
440,0.97,2409.039,2412.476,I feel like this conversation has been happening for longer than I have been here.,105,,
441,0.97,2412.476,2419.784,I appreciate that there is also a fiscal generating request that came out of this counsel.,105,,
442,0.97,2419.784,2439.303,But you would also imagine that it would be a financial benefit to have let's say one individual from a family out there golfing by the other individual from that family goes for a walk around the golf course.,105,,
443,0.97,2439.303,2443.107,I can see that generating more interest and usage in the neighborhood for the green space that we have.,105,,
444,0.97,2443.107,2446.01,"As we create a Denser city, the green spaces are the backyard for the community.",105,,
445,0.97,2446.01,2452.883,I don't have a backyard and would love to be able to walk in the neighborhood.,105,,
446,0.97,2452.883,2455.519,Longfellow Creek for example has great walking paths that and that the golf course.,105,,
447,0.97,2455.519,2457.188,I can't go into the golf course.,105,,
448,0.97,2457.188,2460.024,Have to go about a mile around and then pick up the trail again.,105,,
449,0.97,2460.024,2460.825,That makes no sense.,105,,
450,0.97,2460.825,2463.027,I know the same is true in a number of neighborhoods.,105,,
451,0.97,2463.027,2468.332,This is not just something that is in just one.,105,,
452,0.97,2468.332,2488.352,I'm hearing what we need is action to make sure that the use of that golf space was not sort of prevented from being used because it is not Revenue- generating.,105,,
453,0.97,2488.352,2493.324,I would love to work with this counsel to see if we can get more folks out there using it as a walking or running space.,105,,
454,0.97,2493.324,2498.162,I am jealous of our friends in Tacoma who can go to chambers Bay and walk around and have that beautiful public space.,105,,
455,0.97,2498.162,2499.163,I would like to do that.,105,,
456,0.97,2499.163,2500.03,Consider it done.,106,,
457,0.97,2500.03,2500.831,We are on it.,106,,
458,0.97,2500.831,2502.867,"Moving on to the third pillar, strong communities.",107,,
459,0.97,2502.867,2513.677,"Again, we talked about parks and Recreations that support citywide priorities . We will talk about homelessness and things like that of course.",107,,
460,0.97,2513.677,2516.614,But also continuing to provide affordable and culturally relevant services for our communities.,107,,
461,0.97,2516.614,2531.996,"We do a lot of community building by just bringing events together, either parks and read Rec . cohesion and lifelong learning, including eliminating social isolation with some of the senior populations.",107,,
462,0.97,2531.996,2540.671,And focusing on that gathering space model we do in connecting youth to the work.,107,,
463,0.97,2540.671,2541.672,That is the vision.,107,,
464,0.97,2541.672,2542.473,In terms of the strategies.,107,,
465,0.97,2542.473,2557.221,"On the youth and community gatherings spaces piece, I know that the late night programs recently celebrated its 30th?",108,,
466,0.97,2557.221,2557.521,40th.,109,,
467,0.97,2557.521,2565.429,A big program on Friday and Saturday nights and most community centers.,110,,
468,0.97,2565.429,2567.298,There still a couple on Friday nights.,110,,
469,0.97,2567.298,2586.317,But I recently met with a person who has been really involved in civic life in the city for many years.,110,,
470,0.97,2586.317,2590.821,And a deputy Mayor.,110,,
471,0.97,2590.821,2632.863,"He talked about the fact that there was once upon a time a vision for late night to have a late night 2 and that it not be focused away from recreation, but a be focused on the things that kids still would enjoy doing on a Friday or Saturday night because the priority is getting folks to go, kids to go to a community center on a Friday or Saturday night then being elsewhere . So you want to make sure you're not programming it in a way that makes it not cool ..",110,,
472,0.97,2632.863,2644.208,Talk about the kinds of skills development things that kids like to do.,110,,
473,0.97,2644.208,2647.177,I see that there is a great night program at one of your community centers.,110,,
474,0.97,2647.177,2649.013,It looks like it is only at Jefferson.,110,,
475,0.97,2649.013,2649.713,It is on Saturday nights.,110,,
476,0.97,2649.713,2655.119,It is focused on I think a little bit of an older age demographic.,110,,
477,0.97,2655.119,2660.124,But it has to focus on job and life skills.,110,,
478,0.97,2660.124,2669.633,"So the question was, whatever happened to that late night phase 2 idea for programming?",110,,
479,0.97,2669.633,2674.304,That is still fun and cool but also useful.,110,,
480,0.97,2674.304,2688.419,And just would like to know whether or not there are any thoughts about doing that and whether transforming a space into a recording studio or that sort of thing.,110,,
481,0.97,2688.419,2697.327,Back to your question originally about how we are shifting community center operations in general.,111,,
482,0.97,2697.327,2706.403,There is a lot of that programming that was concurrent to this planning in the park district financial planning.,111,,
483,0.97,2706.403,2709.339,The recreation division is also doing a lot of Rethinking of the specific programs.,111,,
484,0.97,2709.339,2719.983,Really understanding the types of programs that we will offer for each of the age groups and certainly the teams teenagers and adults is a big part.,111,,
485,0.97,2719.983,2723.187,"Had we go from something successful like late night programs, how do we build on those?",111,,
486,0.97,2723.187,2726.857,Through some of these other strategies around job skills development.,111,,
487,0.97,2726.857,2734.798,Certainly all of the stem and technology pieces.,111,,
488,0.97,2734.798,2735.499,Mentorship opportunities.,111,,
489,0.97,2735.499,2738.068,That is what that team is also putting together to continue to grow that.,111,,
490,0.97,2738.068,2738.702,Thank you.,112,,
491,0.97,2738.702,2747.01,Going through some of the other strategies here.,113,,
492,0.97,2747.01,2748.812,We talked about youth enrichment and other opportunities.,113,,
493,0.97,2748.812,2755.919,Looking for other ways to leverage some of the amenities we have for things like preschool and Childcare that we already do.,113,,
494,0.97,2755.919,2768.132,"Actually the majority of our community centers, I have some version of preschool child care or out of school time provided there.",113,,
495,0.97,2768.132,2782.546,We think it is really important as we build strong communities to continue our focus on for your low-cost programming and creating the opportunities for scholarships.,113,,
496,0.97,2782.546,2785.215,A big part of this piece is just supporting communities in whatever they need.,113,,
497,0.97,2785.215,2788.051,"Out of school time, public safety come in terms of Cleanliness and facilities.",113,,
498,0.97,2788.051,2788.652,Job readiness employment.,113,,
499,0.97,2788.652,2791.155,All these pieces that really support what our communities need.,113,,
500,0.97,2791.155,2797.494,Can I make another suggestion?,114,,
501,0.97,2797.494,2799.229,I know we have the youth enrichment in the preschool.,114,,
502,0.97,2799.229,2804.802,I think we do need to have and keep reminding you about being age friendly in our elder services.,114,,
503,0.97,2804.802,2809.173,I am not seeing it anywhere on the Powerpoint.,114,,
504,0.97,2809.173,2810.174,I'm not trying to be critical.,114,,
505,0.97,2810.174,2820.751,I'm just trying to highlight that Besides parks we all work hard to make sure that our elder community can age in place across the board.,114,,
506,0.97,2820.751,2821.885,All the committees.,114,,
507,0.97,2821.885,2827.057,The disabled community.,114,,
508,0.97,2827.057,2828.692,So that when that is not on their.,114,,
509,0.97,2828.692,2832.429,I know that you care about those things because we have worked on a lot of those issues together.,114,,
510,0.97,2832.429,2832.763,So again.,114,,
511,0.97,2832.763,2839.603,I want to make sure that we have a place for that and that is a commitment we have in your strategies and your overall 12 your goal and plan.,114,,
512,0.97,2839.603,2840.871,Absolutely.,115,,
513,0.97,2840.871,2844.308,I will say as an example.,115,,
514,0.97,2844.308,2851.014,This Powerpoint is trying to summarize the entire document.,115,,
515,0.97,2851.014,2855.118,Many more words that are in here that specifically deal with all those issues.,115,,
516,0.97,2855.118,2865.028,Including a focus on our seniors and combating things like social isolation and things like that.,115,,
517,0.97,2865.028,2866.029,It is in the plan.,115,,
518,0.97,2866.029,2868.365,I apologize that it is not front and center.,115,,
519,0.97,2868.365,2878.642,"It is not so much front and center, I'm sure the other Councilmembers that represent districts get this.",116,,
520,0.97,2878.642,2882.045,I know with our community centers they're not just places where people go to play basketball.,116,,
521,0.97,2882.045,2883.947,We feel it feed our Elders four days a week.,116,,
522,0.97,2883.947,2884.514,You know.,116,,
523,0.97,2884.514,2885.148,It is important.,116,,
524,0.97,2885.148,2885.515,Absolutely.,117,,
525,0.97,2885.515,2885.983,I completely agree.,117,,
526,0.97,2885.983,2889.419,Thank you for highlighting that.,117,,
527,0.97,2889.419,2890.42,Councilmember Mosqeda.,118,,
528,0.97,2890.42,2904.635,"On item number two, provide preschool and Childcare, this is a wonderful way to make sure folks get into community centers.",119,,
529,0.97,2904.635,2906.27,Can you remind me how the management is done.,119,,
530,0.97,2906.27,2907.671,Is a certain organizations we contract with?,119,,
531,0.97,2907.671,2909.339,We have many different things that happen.,120,,
532,0.97,2909.339,2915.178,We have for example our programming partner running some of these programs.,120,,
533,0.97,2915.178,2924.755,"We have some of her own out of school time opportunities that we do through 21st century learning center, funding that we get.",120,,
534,0.97,2924.755,2932.696,And we also have other facilities like the Miller Annex where we have a third- party provider who comes in and operates the preschool.,120,,
535,0.97,2932.696,2936.566,"In our 26 centers, I believe 23 have some version of programming, and we have lots of different models.",120,,
536,0.97,2936.566,2953.283,"We also have several programs that are part of the Seattle preschool, so part of what we're trying to do is not necessarily become experts in preschool, but working with our partners that deal to make sure they help us identify the providers.",120,,
537,0.97,2953.283,2958.088,"Another one that you probably know about as well, for example, is the tiny trees preschool that is outdoors.",120,,
538,0.97,2958.088,2964.928,There really creative and innovative in working with us to try to figure out how to low since programs outdoors.,120,,
539,0.97,2964.928,2966.797,They work with the state to get the rules change.,120,,
540,0.97,2966.797,2968.665,There are all these things happening.,120,,
541,0.97,2968.665,3009.573,"So recognizing the partnership model that we have with some of our community providers for child care and preschool, one of the things that is come up in relation to the Coronavirus has been a number of entities, organizations, service providers have Proactively decided to shut down for the day to do sanitizing activities or out of an abundance of caution if there's any concern around may be a potential family member that you just want to make sure there's no virus transmitted in the organization.",121,,
542,0.97,3009.573,3010.474,We applaud them for that work.,121,,
543,0.97,3010.474,3015.879,"We want to be extra vigilant, especially right now, to make sure we're not transmitting any diseases, especially in places where we have community members attending.",121,,
544,0.97,3015.879,3037.3,"In doing so, we also recognize that our six leave sick leave policy doesn't currently provide for parents to be able to access paid sick days when a child care facility for example closes down out of an abundance of caution and not at the direction of an elected official or public official.",121,,
545,0.97,3037.3,3037.901,For example.,121,,
546,0.97,3037.901,3067.931,"If a school were to close because the superintendent or Mayor or county decided it was really important out of public health concerns to close it, parents can axis sick leave to make sure the days wages paid, but for some Childcare providers, including those working out of our community centers right now, the current statute does not say that those parents can access paid sick leave.",121,,
547,0.97,3067.931,3078.308,"Our office is working on a legislative fix that would make it so that if any organization were to close its doors, it doesn't require a public official making that closure.",121,,
548,0.97,3078.308,3094.624,"One of our great organizations could decide, out of an abundance of caution, they wanted to close it down for cleaning or health related concerns.",121,,
549,0.97,3094.624,3097.727,That would be a qualifying event for any of our parents to axis sick leave.,121,,
550,0.97,3097.727,3099.663,That is something we will talk to the colleagues about.,121,,
551,0.97,3099.663,3110.64,"But it does relate to parks in terms of your partnership with those Childcare providers and wanted to make sure that no parent fears that they're not going to earn a days wage and that they can access those six leaves, it is a small Tweak were making in the next few weeks.",121,,
552,0.97,3110.64,3113.043,Thank you.,122,,
553,0.97,3113.043,3117.08,I only have about 30 more slides here.,122,,
554,0.97,3117.08,3118.348,I will keep going quickly.,122,,
555,0.97,3118.348,3122.586,The last piece here is on organizational excellence.,122,,
556,0.97,3122.586,3133.763,"Again, this is a recognition that as we do the work really focused on the vision that we have the expertise, the capacity and resources to do the work.",122,,
557,0.97,3133.763,3151.448,"So we envision our agency as we achieve this to making decisions grounded in equity, continuing to engage with communities, having recruited the best team possible, training, maintaining and developing them.",122,,
558,0.97,3151.448,3156.887,Also working on decision-making process inclusive so the folks on the ground and Frontlines are able to participate in these really important decisions.,122,,
559,0.97,3156.887,3160.991,That Articulates the vision we have.,122,,
560,0.97,3160.991,3162.325,Some of those strategies around this piece.,122,,
561,0.97,3162.325,3168.498,I have talked about equity and doing this equity analysis and scorecard we're talking about.,122,,
562,0.97,3168.498,3182.746,We are also going to pursue a national accreditation through the national parks and recreation Association to ensure that at a minimum we are meeting the standards of parks and recreation agencies.,122,,
563,0.97,3182.746,3188.018,We will of course do that through adding an equity component.,122,,
564,0.97,3188.018,3189.419,But things like the systems and Technologies.,122,,
565,0.97,3189.419,3212.909,"We're doing a lot of work around continuous improvement, make sure that becomes part of our practice . and the other piece is on the continuing engagement.",122,,
566,0.97,3212.909,3225.989,"As we work to serve people, we want to make sure that we create this great plan and publish it and roll it out, but it doesn't do any good if we don't go back to our communities and asked him again to make sure that what they told us is what we are doing and still what they need for us to do.",122,,
567,0.97,3225.989,3229.392,"I forgot to mention each of these strategies, each of those components having commitment to equity Callout.",122,,
568,0.97,3229.392,3237.434,"For example, on this one it would be important if we are making these decisions and investments that we are doing it through racial equity framework and we think about continuing to train our workforce on these issues.",122,,
569,0.97,3237.434,3247.711,Impressive.,123,,
570,0.97,3252.048,3253.516,I went over the vision and strategies.,123,,
571,0.97,3253.516,3259.255,To give you a little background on how we got to this plan and how it is going to lead into the park district 6 your financial plan.,123,,
572,0.97,3259.255,3273.637,We have done a lot with engagement.,123,,
573,0.97,3273.637,3274.337,A two-year engagement process.,123,,
574,0.97,3274.337,3295.058,"Really Ramped up here over the summer, but we have done everything from looking at all the plans we have done over the last five years, the legacy plan, the community center, parks and open spaces plan, we have a lot of plans . spoken a lot with their own staff about what they see happening, the best practices.",123,,
575,0.97,3295.058,3297.527,"Of course our two advisory board, the oversight Committee in the park for.",123,,
576,0.97,3297.527,3299.529,As well as lots of engagement with the community.,123,,
577,0.97,3299.529,3305.568,That really Ramped up the summer with Online as well as event participation and citywide events and we held two parks and Rec Fests to help folks understand what we do.,123,,
578,0.97,3305.568,3330.994,"We did lots of surveying across the city, we did a statistically valid survey that represents a demographic of the city but also lots of smaller surveys, door-to-door surveys, surveys in our community centers and did everything we could to hear from folks.",123,,
579,0.97,3330.994,3332.462,And the blue components talk about the Taskforces.,123,,
580,0.97,3332.462,3348.078,In additional to the general planning we have folks who are interested in various items like Stakeholders around viewpoints and homesteads and trails . They did work and come back and divide provide some guidance.,123,,
581,0.97,3348.078,3348.478,Slow down.,124,,
582,0.97,3348.478,3349.546,You've done to community meetings.,124,,
583,0.97,3349.546,3353.116,We have done one so far.,125,,
584,0.97,3353.116,3353.783,Where is that?,126,,
585,0.97,3353.783,3354.384,I am sorry.,126,,
586,0.97,3354.384,3355.685,For the park district.,126,,
587,0.97,3355.685,3363.693,Yes.,126,,
588,0.97,3363.693,3365.195,That was a strategic planning process.,126,,
589,0.97,3365.195,3367.13,"In terms of, we will get to that.",126,,
590,0.97,3367.13,3375.638,This gives you the very sort of time limit we are on here.,126,,
591,0.97,3375.638,3393.957,The bubble on the left tells you everything we have done in the past to lead up to this.,126,,
592,0.97,3393.957,3403.466,"It really between February and may is when the work of the park district oversight committee really Ramped up in terms of them listening to the public, digesting all the things we learned and have been sharing along the way, and then making recommendations to us.",126,,
593,0.97,3403.466,3405.568,I will NOTE we have also been meeting with Council members.,126,,
594,0.97,3405.568,3407.771,We have a meeting scheduled with others to hear from them.,126,,
595,0.97,3407.771,3412.442,Feedback from what you have been hearing as well as well as any input you have on the next six year cycle.,126,,
596,0.97,3412.442,3414.043,Will you be in Lake City Thursday.,127,,
597,0.97,3414.043,3414.477,Yes.,128,,
598,0.97,3414.477,3418.148,And then we will be on Saturday.,128,,
599,0.97,3418.148,3420.016,These meetings will happen in March.,128,,
600,0.97,3420.016,3430.493,Between March and may the oversight committee will take all of that and begin to put together some proposals.,128,,
601,0.97,3430.493,3436.199,Concurrent to this we are also working with the Mayor and her office to identify her priorities and make sure we are thinking about what is next.,128,,
602,0.97,3436.199,3447.41,"Once all that work is done, the Mayor will transmit to you all in your role as the governing board for the park district in August, so the next six your financial plan.",128,,
603,0.97,3447.41,3452.148,Than you all will have the opportunity.,128,,
604,0.97,3452.148,3457.12,We're trying to schedule that will before the Recess.,129,,
605,0.97,3457.12,3458.354,So we're not jammed like last time.,129,,
606,0.97,3458.354,3460.824,This is a big deal because it is a six year spending.,129,,
607,0.97,3460.824,3469.732,Pushing the executive to get the numbers and a lot of the detail will before the Recess.,129,,
608,0.97,3469.732,3483.546,"So I can share some of it and start talking to my colleagues and what the needs are for the library levy, how much room we have here or there . based on the information you bring back to us from committee.",129,,
609,0.97,3483.546,3486.216,And we're trying to schedule a couple of meetings before budget.,129,,
610,0.97,3486.216,3486.449,Yes.,130,,
611,0.97,3486.449,3496.025,"After the Mayor submits her recommendation in August or late August, we actually will scheduled two park district meetings.",130,,
612,0.97,3496.025,3502.632,One that I first--one on the 10th and one on the 24th.,130,,
613,0.97,3502.632,3508.705,We will actually take up the spending plan and have discussions about potential modifications.,130,,
614,0.97,3508.705,3518.882,We also will have a public hearing here in chambers the week of 14 September.,130,,
615,0.97,3518.882,3528.691,"The public will have the ability to come and weigh in on the mayors propose recommendations before the park district takes any action on that spending plan, which will happen technically as we adopt the budget at the end of November.",130,,
616,0.97,3528.691,3531.394,You can begin to make decisions as early as the end of September.,130,,
617,0.97,3531.394,3533.463,Am I doing the public hearing here?,131,,
618,0.97,3533.463,3537.0,Yes.,132,,
619,0.97,3537.0,3539.168,I was trying to make sure.,133,,
620,0.97,3539.168,3548.111,"Needless to say, everyone is anxious about the six year spending plan that I'm trying to get a little bit earlier.",133,,
621,0.97,3548.111,3554.817,So we don't slide into budget because she is going to have her hands full.,133,,
622,0.97,3554.817,3561.124,"Like the last years, we always seem to have these park meetings where we vote on the budget in the middle of budget, and I don't want to do that this year.",133,,
623,0.97,3561.124,3571.901,"To make the work even more complicated and give you more to do, part of the creating a six your financial plan obviously includes our regular biannual budget.",134,,
624,0.97,3571.901,3572.969,We will go through the process.,134,,
625,0.97,3572.969,3581.945,We have got to do that budgeting work at the same time as we're doing this because it all has to align and support the same programs.,134,,
626,0.97,3581.945,3594.657,"I think the difference is keeping everyone, reminding them what the voters passed in 2014.",135,,
627,0.97,3594.657,3597.26,What we can and cannot do on the metropolitan park district side.,135,,
628,0.97,3597.26,3600.33,"Keeping those separate, but knowing that the money is part of the park district money.",135,,
629,0.97,3600.33,3602.532,That has been the area where people get lost.,135,,
630,0.97,3602.532,3607.67,"Quite frankly, if I did not have a Flowchart, I would get lost too.",135,,
631,0.97,3607.67,3609.172,We just want to be ahead of that.,135,,
632,0.97,3609.172,3610.273,So thank you.,135,,
633,0.97,3610.273,3614.377,"As you mentioned, we have two additional meetings this week.",136,,
634,0.97,3614.377,3623.152,Sort of in response to some of the questions and concerns people shared with us around participating in public meetings.,136,,
635,0.97,3623.152,3642.171,We will also set up an electronic town hall next week for folks who don't want to come to a meeting but still want to share information.,136,,
636,0.97,3642.171,3646.209,Then we will do a similar type of Townhall for our staff to make sure we get another opportunity.,136,,
637,0.97,3646.209,3648.678,Then all of that information will be shared with the oversight committee members.,136,,
638,0.97,3648.678,3655.618,"These meetings are structured so the park district and committee members or did there leading the discussion, listening, really getting a chance to interact with the committee members to hear directly from them as well.",136,,
639,0.97,3655.618,3656.819,On slide--excuse me.,137,,
640,0.97,3656.819,3669.666,On slide 19 there is also a web address.,137,,
641,0.97,3669.666,3671.834,So you can write to us at any time as well.,137,,
642,0.97,3671.834,3673.469,Please feel free to share that with everybody.,137,,
643,0.97,3673.469,3674.504,There is a survey.,138,,
644,0.97,3674.504,3675.838,Ethically already has 700 people participate.,138,,
645,0.97,3675.838,3681.01,"There is also an Online survey we encourage folks, even if they come to these meetings, hey can also take the s and give us more.",138,,
646,0.97,3681.01,3682.211,We're documenting all of this.,138,,
647,0.97,3682.211,3686.115,"And we will publish it to make sure folks have that, know what the committees are asking for.",138,,
648,0.97,3686.115,3697.226,"When you pick these locations, or any of my colleagues, can they ask to have some of these community meetings in their community?",139,,
649,0.97,3697.226,3699.162,How are you spreading this around?,139,,
650,0.97,3699.162,3709.439,"The intent, these are meetings that are actually part district oversight committee meetings.",140,,
651,0.97,3709.439,3711.107,Not necessarily meetings when I go out in communities.,140,,
652,0.97,3711.107,3718.181,Normally these meetings all happen downtown in our office and Boardroom.,140,,
653,0.97,3718.181,3728.758,"So rather than do that, we wanted to at least get out into the communities and get folks an opportunity to participate.",140,,
654,0.97,3728.758,3732.628,"So in terms of coming out to other meetings, I am happy to come out and bring my staff out.",140,,
655,0.97,3732.628,3735.965,What I can't commit to is having the oversight committee convene a meeting in other communities.,140,,
656,0.97,3735.965,3741.604,"But I will also say that as I have tried to convey as far as the presentation, we've had lots and lots of robust engagement.",140,,
657,0.97,3741.604,3755.318,"People told us, people are aware of the park district and shared a lot of things they wanted to see as part of the park district already.",140,,
658,0.97,3755.318,3758.221,We have all that documentation and have been sharing that with the oversight committee.,140,,
659,0.97,3758.221,3761.224,I feel like we have done a pretty good job of getting some pretty robust engagement.,140,,
660,0.97,3761.224,3767.23,"Again, that is not to say that I am absolutely happy to meet any other Council district to talk about this work.",140,,
661,0.97,3767.23,3776.372,"I just, you know, there will not be the official park district oversight committee meetings, but we will share the information.",140,,
662,0.97,3776.372,3777.507,I will be candid.,141,,
663,0.97,3777.507,3790.253,"Some of the same people come to the same meetings and know about this stuff, and so if Councilmember Peterson said Madison park or I said bitterly, could you do one on a Saturday?",141,,
664,0.97,3790.253,3797.026,To get a better turnout quite frankly?,141,,
665,0.97,3797.026,3804.534,What I've learned in the last four years of chairing this Committee is often we get the same people and the same voices and that ends up with the same issues and the same I want this.,141,,
666,0.97,3804.534,3812.975,"Nothing against golf and pickle ball, or Soccer, but there are other things about having the community centers open at night.",141,,
667,0.97,3812.975,3820.75,A lot of the things we know are more anecdotal and healing from constituents.,141,,
668,0.97,3820.75,3826.856,So if there is an opportunity to say we can do that.,141,,
669,0.97,3826.856,3840.87,I can say can you do a meeting on a Saturday at bitter Lake at Madison park or West Seattle.,141,,
670,0.97,3840.87,3841.47,We can do that.,141,,
671,0.97,3841.47,3846.509,I am happy to come out and meet with anybody.,142,,
672,0.97,3846.509,3865.027,"Just to reiterate, these meetings aren't, we've got a pretty compressed Timeline but we have had a lot of engagement not to say that we can't get more.",142,,

675,0.97,3870.032,3881.043,"For Exaple, for the meetings this week, we had been contacting Community-Based organizations across the city and asking them to make sure they understand that we are having these meetings and getting them to come out.",142,,

678,0.97,3885.348,3894.657,As part of engagement for the strategic plan we did Door-To- door surveys for folks in up to 12 different languages to try to make sure we go out to the folks that don't always come out to us.,142,,
679,0.97,3894.657,3901.764,That is not to say that if we can provide additional opportunities for additional groups I'm happy to support them.,142,,
680,0.97,3901.764,3917.113,"As a look at the six year plan here, one of the things I would love to know more about is whether or not the financial planning needs to be adjusted to address any new workforce challenges.",143,,
681,0.97,3917.113,3921.884,I am thinking of safety for the workers in the parks.,143,,

683,0.97,3936.899,3958.421,"What kind of new workforce challenges have we seen given may be changing public health issues in our community and also changing workforce dynamic so we can continue to recruit and keep, retain a robust workforce for our parks?",143,,
684,0.97,3958.421,3961.29,I know it is something you have been a champion of in the past.,143,,
685,0.97,3961.29,3969.031,If there is any way that our financial planning needs to address how we fund specific activities for workforce development and retaining folks I would be interested in that aspect.,143,,
686,0.97,3969.031,3971.033,It is really important.,144,,
687,0.97,3971.033,3991.954,"Another thing that is happening concurrent all of this is all of our divisions internally have been putting together proposals on some of their priorities, and particularly around this organizational excellence piece . This idea of how to make sure that the staff have the resources they need.",144,,
688,0.97,3991.954,4014.176,"Had a make sure we have the right level of staffing for the work we are doing and making sure that they are prepared for these new issues, whether it is members of the navigation team or whether we have the right number of folks doing that, whether the folks that are cleaning our comfort stations and even just basic things like situations where we have managing of a whole lot of people.",144,,
