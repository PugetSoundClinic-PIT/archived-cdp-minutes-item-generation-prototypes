12,0.97,52.986,58.491,"Thank you, and as the clerk did mention during the roll.",10,,
13,0.97,58.491,61.995,Council President Juarez has been excused from today's meeting.,10,,
14,0.97,61.995,63.93,We look forward to approval of the agenda.,10,,
15,0.97,63.93,67.967,"If there's no objection, the agenda will be adopted.",10,,
16,0.97,67.967,70.27,Hearing no objection.,10,,
17,0.97,70.27,70.937,The agenda is adopted.,10,,
18,0.97,70.937,71.638,Chairs report.,10,,
19,0.97,71.638,78.678,I'm going to go ahead and defer on making chair's report at the front end.,10,,
20,0.97,78.678,82.715,But I will make some comments before both of our presentations.,10,,
21,0.97,82.715,84.484,Just preview the agenda for the general public.,10,,
22,0.97,84.484,90.19,Today we're going to be getting an update from the just care program.,10,,
23,0.97,90.19,97.363,"I believe it's the third time, just care has presented to my committee.",10,,
24,0.97,97.363,105.305,They presented twice over the course of 2021 to my predecessor committee.,10,,
25,0.97,105.305,116.282,We're going to get a program update and talk about some potential strategies to refer a shut down of the program which is currently expected to expire in June.,10,,
26,0.97,116.282,120.253,We will then hear a presentation from Seattle public library.,10,,
27,0.97,120.253,128.495,Given an overview to the committee and scope and scale of services and operation.,10,,
28,0.97,128.495,134.534,It'll include an appearance from newly selected permanent chief librarian Tom Fey.,10,,
29,0.97,134.534,142.408,So I look forward to that presentation and the ability to congratulate our new chief librarian in the committee.,10,,
30,0.97,142.408,145.678,"So with that, we will go on to public comment.",10,,
31,0.97,145.678,148.882,I'm going to moderate the public comment period.,10,,
32,0.97,148.882,159.959,And we'll go ahead right now to indicate that we'll go into 2:33 and give it 30 minutes just to be safe at the front of the agenda here.,10,,
33,0.97,159.959,167.7,Because I do believe we have about 12 public Commenters and want to give them each two minutes to speak.,10,,
34,0.97,167.7,172.839,And that should be plenty of wiggle room if things run over.,10,,
35,0.97,172.839,177.844,"As has been our custom, I will have the clerk call on each Speaker by name.",10,,
36,0.97,177.844,181.214,"As I said, they will speak for 20 minutes.",10,,
37,0.97,181.214,184.117,To the speakers out there.,10,,
38,0.97,184.117,201.234,"When you do get ready to speak, there will be a message that you've been Unmuted and that will be your Cue to speak and you will have two minutes time.",10,,
39,0.97,201.234,208.975,"With that, why don't we open the public speaking period and we'll go till 2:33.",10,,
40,0.97,208.975,210.777,We'll just say 2:30.,10,,
41,0.97,210.777,217.951,Our first Speaker is yours to call Mr. clerk.,10,,
42,0.97,217.951,231.464,"Mr. chair, we have 12 people signed up for public comment but none are currently listed as present.",11,,
43,0.97,231.464,231.864,"Okay, well.",12,,
44,0.97,231.864,243.009,I got a text indicating that there is a log in error in the E-mail that they received.,13,,
45,0.97,243.009,254.921,"Do we have, that does seem strange we would have 12 public Commenters none of which would be present.",14,,
46,0.97,254.921,257.49,"Why don't we, give us a second to check that out.",15,,
47,0.97,257.49,267.567,I will give a brief moment for it to address that.,16,,
48,0.97,267.567,271.437,There's not really much we can do for public comment.,16,,
49,0.97,271.437,275.975,It do you want to just recess the minute for two minutes while you take a look or.,16,,
50,0.97,275.975,277.21,That would be your prerogative.,17,,
51,0.97,277.21,282.081,"Yeah, well I guess I'm asking how long do you think it'll take?",18,,
52,0.97,282.081,282.382,Hold on.,19,,
53,0.97,282.382,282.649,Checking.,19,,
54,0.97,282.649,284.25,I'm looking at the back in now.,19,,
55,0.97,284.25,289.489,So hold on for just a second.,19,,
56,0.97,289.489,289.756,Okay.,20,,
57,0.97,289.756,291.824,Great.,20,,
58,0.97,291.824,300.133,"Excuse me Council member Lewis, you can actually reorder the agenda if you would like and have public comment come in after.",21,,
59,0.97,300.133,303.403,But again it's your choice.,21,,
60,0.97,303.403,303.87,"Yeah, understood.",22,,
61,0.97,303.87,313.546,"I think that pacing would be a little strange for how we typically, I don't want to have a public comment period necessarily that's like, commenting on the meeting.",22,,
62,0.97,313.546,322.021,I think typically it's an opportunity for the public to comment on agenda items and express their input.,22,,
63,0.97,322.021,331.931,To inform the issue and the meeting looking forward and I think it would be sort of a strange departure to do it after.,22,,
64,0.97,331.931,335.568,It would appear we have the wrong information in the forum.,23,,
65,0.97,335.568,343.976,"So I'm not sure we can, we can update the forums so people will have to sign back in for the public Commenters.",23,,
66,0.97,343.976,349.549,"So, or we can send E-Mails out with the updates but it will take some time for them to get in.",23,,
67,0.97,349.549,351.15,Get in the meeting.,23,,
68,0.97,351.15,354.287,So I'm not sure what we can do here.,23,,
69,0.97,354.287,361.728,Hang on while we update the forms and I'll let you know.,23,,
70,0.97,361.728,366.699,"Chief librarian Fey, who I just said it will be a while so they can leave the meeting.",24,,
71,0.97,366.699,368.401,If they're still present.,24,,
72,0.97,368.401,369.969,But they're on mute.,24,,
73,0.97,369.969,375.942,How long will the library presentation take if you're still with us?,24,,
74,0.97,375.942,378.778,It would be about 20 minutes or so.,25,,
75,0.97,378.778,381.781,I can run through it pretty quickly.,25,,
76,0.97,381.781,389.655,"Yeah, my suspicion is the bulk of our public Commenters want to weigh in on the just care conversation.",26,,
77,0.97,389.655,393.76,So here's what I say we should do to keep the flow of the meeting and not waste time.,26,,
78,0.97,393.76,400.6,Why don't we go ahead and do the Seattle public library presentation now for the next 20 minutes.,26,,
79,0.97,400.6,405.037,Let it sort out getting the public Commenters taken care of.,26,,
80,0.97,405.037,407.073,We will resume for public comment.,26,,
81,0.97,407.073,414.881,And then the PDA presentation on just care.,26,,
82,0.97,414.881,417.416,"So, with that, would the clerk.",26,,
83,0.97,417.416,421.988,"Well Linda, how should I move to reorder the agenda?",26,,
84,0.97,421.988,430.496,"Just a simple, if there's no objection we would like to reorder the agenda today to bring forward the library presentation.",27,,
85,0.97,430.496,430.863,Thank you.,28,,
86,0.97,430.863,443.776,"So, I would just ask that indulgence of the committee if there's no objection to reorder the agenda and put agenda item two.",28,,
87,0.97,443.776,456.189,The presentation from the Seattle public library to the front of the agenda and to then put public comment after agenda item two.,28,,
88,0.97,456.189,458.624,And we would then consider agenda item one.,28,,
89,0.97,458.624,465.298,"If there's no objection, that would be the reordering of the agenda.",28,,
90,0.97,465.298,466.599,Seeing no objection from colleagues.,28,,
91,0.97,466.599,470.369,The agenda will be so Reordered.,28,,
92,0.97,470.369,478.444,"So with that, Mr. clerk would you read item two into the record.",28,,
93,0.97,478.444,483.216,"Agenda item two, Seattle public library's operations overview.",29,,
94,0.97,483.216,483.649,Thank you.,30,,
95,0.97,483.649,493.226,And we do have joining us some folks from the Seattle public library including auspiciously our new librarian Mr. Tom Fey.,30,,
96,0.97,493.226,499.432,Tom just want to take a moment to officially congratulate you.,30,,
97,0.97,499.432,500.867,This is great news.,30,,
98,0.97,500.867,507.106,Really thrilled we're hosting your first public appearance since your election this morning.,30,,
99,0.97,507.106,508.608,I will hand it over to you.,30,,
100,0.97,508.608,512.111,If you would introduce your colleagues from the library.,30,,
101,0.97,512.111,518.684,"And if you would, then go ahead and begin your introductory remarks and presentation.",30,,
102,0.97,518.684,520.386,So thank you for joining us.,30,,
103,0.97,520.386,524.023,Thank you chair Lewis.,31,,
104,0.97,524.023,529.996,Appreciate the opportunity to give a little more information about the library operations.,31,,
105,0.97,529.996,531.664,"And again, thank you for the congratulations.",31,,
106,0.97,531.664,541.14,It is a big day as we are able to move forward now with this particular position being determined.,31,,
107,0.97,541.14,553.886,"So again thank you all, also appreciate all of the Council supporting this last year through the pandemic and all the budget crisis we're facing for this last year.",31,,
108,0.97,553.886,556.689,So I do want to thank you for that.,31,,
109,0.97,556.689,565.131,"With me today, and I believe Rick SH Eraeridan is here.",31,,
110,0.97,565.131,571.07,Rick is over our strategic advancement.,31,,
111,0.97,571.07,580.379,Really focuses on government affairs and our marketing and Communicationings.,31,,
112,0.97,580.379,589.155,I'Ms . So I'm ready and Jacob I believe you're advancing the slides.,31,,
113,0.97,589.155,592.224,So if you would advance the slide for me.,31,,
114,0.97,592.224,596.963,"We have 26 library, we have about 605 Ftes.",31,,
115,0.97,596.963,611.577,We have a five member government board of trustees and for 2022 our budget is approximately 110 million across all of our various fund sources.,31,,
116,0.97,611.577,613.245,"Jacob, next please.",31,,
117,0.97,613.245,614.38,And some basic data from 2019.,31,,
118,0.97,614.38,622.655,We're still using that as we begin to normalize here in 2022.,31,,
119,0.97,622.655,629.395,But we have 10.9 million Online visits and we circulate about 12.6 million items a year.,31,,
120,0.97,629.395,635.668,As you can see we have quite a bit of attendees when we're able to do programs.,31,,
121,0.97,635.668,636.068,"Nearly 300,000.",31,,
122,0.97,636.068,651.183,As a reminder because the Council was instrumental in advancing our levee it did pass with levee approval.,31,,
123,0.97,651.183,652.618,Next slide please.,31,,
124,0.97,652.618,665.131,And the board has all fiscal over sight for the library system.,31,,
125,0.97,665.131,665.965,They have broad responsibilities.,31,,
126,0.97,665.965,673.506,And that power is vested to them through the Washington state law.,31,,
127,0.97,673.506,675.775,We recently got a new President.,31,,
128,0.97,675.775,679.478,"Jay rich is our vice president, Ron Chu serves on our board.",31,,
129,0.97,679.478,683.749,Christie England is going to have her time expire in April.,31,,
130,0.97,683.749,693.626,So we will at some point be back in front of this committee to hopefully get a new board member.,31,,
131,0.97,693.626,698.864,And then Harriston is the newest member of the board.,31,,
132,0.97,698.864,699.198,Next please.,31,,
133,0.97,699.198,706.205,This budget overview gives you a basic idea of how the budget is spent.,31,,
134,0.97,706.205,709.775,We are a people business.,31,,
135,0.97,709.775,710.276,People serving people.,31,,
136,0.97,710.276,715.948,And so 67% of our cost Aspersonnel.,31,,
137,0.97,715.948,716.549,11% is books and material.,31,,
138,0.97,716.549,724.223,"10% is going to be our capital improvement, major maintenance projects.",31,,
139,0.97,724.223,730.996,"Then we have our typical facilities, rent, etc.",31,,
140,0.97,730.996,731.33,Next please.,31,,
141,0.97,731.33,736.368,The library staff processes a lot of material.,31,,
142,0.97,736.368,740.306,We are a large system with millions of books.,31,,
143,0.97,740.306,746.645,"We process about 250,000 physical and electronic items annually.",31,,
144,0.97,746.645,750.983,And we have just about any time 6.8 million physical items out.,31,,
145,0.97,750.983,756.822,We have 5.2 million holds throughout the course of the year.,31,,
146,0.97,756.822,764.597,This requires a lot of trucks and environmental material that's what you see with Anh.,31,,
147,0.97,764.597,769.502,The system we have is being replaced this year toward the end of the year which will allow us to be more efficient.,31,,
148,0.97,769.502,775.841,And it will actually be off site from the central library.,31,,
149,0.97,775.841,782.281,So it will allow us trucking better throughout the rest of Seattle.,31,,
150,0.97,782.281,787.953,And our facilities as mentioned 27 locations and you can see the building here we call the mock.,31,,
151,0.97,787.953,789.722,Which is our maintenance operation center.,31,,
152,0.97,789.722,795.06,That's where our automated material will be running as well as all of our other maintenance operations.,31,,
153,0.97,795.06,804.737,It's important to note that we have seven Carnegie era libraries that are more than 100 years old.,31,,
154,0.97,804.737,811.877,And maintaining comes with a cost.,31,,
155,0.97,811.877,820.186,They're dearly loved historical assets but they come with the responsibility of maintaining them.,31,,
156,0.97,820.186,823.556,They started as libraries for all.,31,,
157,0.97,823.556,825.457,That measure now is more than 24 years old.,31,,
158,0.97,825.457,838.637,We know that we have Moreinfrastructure needs as we start to Remodel them for the generation of today.,31,,
159,0.97,838.637,843.609,"We have security, it, hr, all the things that you can imagine to run the library.",31,,
160,0.97,843.609,848.647,We do have staffing constraints as you can imagine in a seven day a week operation.,31,,
161,0.97,848.647,869.602,We do have minimum staffing requirements with our con track Contracture contractural obligations.,31,,
162,0.97,869.602,882.214,And we're seeing more of our staff has to live outside of the Seattle area which impacts us during a variety of situations such as inclement weather.,31,,
163,0.97,882.214,882.548,Next please.,31,,
164,0.97,882.548,888.721,Security obviously making us safe and welcoming environment does take security.,31,,
165,0.97,888.721,892.558,Like others in the city experience issues from time to time.,31,,
166,0.97,892.558,895.16,We have 18 security officers for 27 locations.,31,,
167,0.97,895.16,897.496,So not enough to have an officer present in every location.,31,,
168,0.97,897.496,902.801,So we have to do a lot of rotations.,31,,
169,0.97,902.801,903.602,And visits for our security.,31,,
170,0.97,903.602,915.948,"We do have an increasing number of serious safety and security incidents and so that is, something we continue to monitor and come up with new techniques and approaches for Deescalation.",31,,
171,0.97,915.948,920.586,"But as I like to say, 99% of our transactions go very well.",31,,
172,0.97,920.586,926.258,And we do have a few that obviously do not.,31,,
173,0.97,926.258,932.698,"So that does have an impact on staff, that does have an impact on patrons when that does occur.",31,,
174,0.97,932.698,942.408,Some of the areas we know we've had probably more incidents than others are lists here on the right.,31,,
175,0.97,942.408,943.042,"Central Ballard, Capitol Hill.",31,,
176,0.97,943.042,953.218,We have security there to help us with incidents as they occur.,31,,
177,0.97,953.218,956.155,Next please.,31,,
178,0.97,956.155,966.198,"And then the branch all of them have securities, Wifi, reference services.",31,,
179,0.97,966.198,969.001,And when we're ready to have programs in person.,31,,
180,0.97,969.001,981.814,We're hoping to get back to those now that the mandate is going away.,31,,
181,0.97,981.814,984.116,"We have close to 900,000 items.",31,,
182,0.97,984.116,995.06,We have had lots of nonprofit groups use our meeting space as well as individuals and our branches nearly 3.7 million visits in 2019.,31,,
183,0.97,995.06,1000.199,And of course 2.5 million in Wifi sessions throughout the library system.,31,,
184,0.97,1000.199,1006.805,Folks know that they can connect to us any time.,31,,

255,0.97,1441.273,1450.449,That allows folks to get a free access to a number of museums and other institutions in the city that they may not normally be able to afford or be able to get to.,31,,
256,0.97,1450.449,1460.525,And,31,,

260,0.97,1608.173,1617.882,Next please.,32,,
261,0.97,1617.882,1625.19,And we hope to get a little bit of reprieve.,32,,
262,0.97,1625.19,1633.598,We know health and safety as we're coming on to the pandemic and programs brought into the city.,32,,
263,0.97,1633.598,1642.307,We also know that long term financial assisting facility will be an issue for all of us as we look at future budgets.,32,,
264,0.97,1642.307,1646.478,Then of course as we mention the aging infrastructure.,32,,
265,0.97,1646.478,1663.161,"Our buildings now even the central library is moving on to being nearly 20 years old which means higher cost for replacement, repairs Andsignificant things like roofs needing to be completely changed out.",32,,
266,0.97,1663.161,1667.032,We know that we'll continue experienced climate impacts.,32,,
267,0.97,1667.032,1672.737,That can be everything from heat to smoke.,32,,
268,0.97,1672.737,1674.673,Those conditions are difficult.,32,,
269,0.97,1674.673,1679.01,Especially in buildings that don't have air-conditioning.,32,,
270,0.97,1679.01,1691.856,We're actively working to do that and we appreciate the Council's support in moving to have two libraries in the 2022 budget receive air-conditioning which is the northeast and Southwest branches.,32,,
271,0.97,1691.856,1692.59,Appreciate that support.,32,,
272,0.97,1692.59,1698.73,That will bring on larger facilities that again can be there in those conditions.,32,,
273,0.97,1698.73,1708.84,"And then, of course the other concern I most recently mentioned that there's obviously a significant reliance on our foundation for program funding.",32,,
274,0.97,1708.84,1722.754,"Which while it seems like that's great it also means that, we are relying on Day-To- day programming, budget from them and not able to do maybe as much as the innovative work that a foundation often provides.",32,,
275,0.97,1722.754,1726.891,Those are some of the challenges.,32,,
276,0.97,1726.891,1727.292,And next please.,32,,
277,0.97,1727.292,1733.198,I would open up for any questions that you might have.,32,,
278,0.97,1733.198,1739.17,Thank you so much Chieflibrarian Fay.,33,,
279,0.97,1739.17,1744.843,Sorry colleagues I should have flagged at the beginning that I wanted you to hold comments until the conclusion of the presentation.,33,,
280,0.97,1744.843,1762.193,But at this time I will open it up to folks.,33,,
281,0.97,1762.193,1772.704,For some reason I can't see.,33,,
282,0.97,1777.442,1799.964,What is the process for the library in bad weather.,34,,
283,0.97,1799.964,1813.311,What the process looks like for coordination so that emergency shelters and libraries have the opportunity to have a better understanding of what the network looks like for those urgent situations.,34,,
284,0.97,1813.311,1822.82,We're actually part of those discussions with emergency management so we're involved in that.,35,,
285,0.97,1822.82,1827.358,We also have developed some of our internal plans for each of our various conditions.,35,,
286,0.97,1827.358,1834.666,"So we know that, in the heat, and usually that also includes smoke or might include smoke.",35,,
287,0.97,1834.666,1837.202,We know that our Air- conditioned buildings will get too hot.,35,,
288,0.97,1837.202,1841.539,People are not going to be able to be in and staff won't be either.,35,,
289,0.97,1841.539,1855.386,So what we have learned over time is let's Proactively Preemptively I guess close those that we know don't have air-conditioning and move that staff over to buildings that do have air-conditioning.,35,,
290,0.97,1855.386,1862.66,To make sure that we have as much physical Footprint over for air-conditioned spaces or smoke free.,35,,
291,0.97,1862.66,1863.595,Nearly smoke free spaces as possible.,35,,
292,0.97,1863.595,1865.997,That's one level of work that we do around that.,35,,
293,0.97,1865.997,1871.135,And that's coordinated and we let the emergency management team know what we're doing.,35,,
294,0.97,1871.135,1872.337,Which buildings will be open.,35,,
295,0.97,1872.337,1874.205,"What hours will be open, etc.",35,,
296,0.97,1874.205,1878.509,"And in the cold, it is a couple of tiered systems.",35,,
297,0.97,1878.509,1884.515,"We have a tier that's the worse case, worse case as far as open buildings.",35,,
298,0.97,1884.515,1890.221,There are conditions in which we just can't get anything open.,35,,
299,0.97,1890.221,1894.792,When transportation has nearly shut down or completely shut down.,35,,
300,0.97,1894.792,1898.83,"But, we have two tiers for those branches we can open.",35,,
301,0.97,1898.83,1904.702,And that would be the central library is kind of always in that package.,35,,
302,0.97,1904.702,1911.442,As well as six other locations and we have another tier that has 12 to 14 locations that can be open.,35,,
303,0.97,1911.442,1917.949,All of that is planned on basically where our staff live and where we think we can get them.,35,,
304,0.97,1917.949,1920.385,"It's also planned on bus Routs, and also plowed roads.",35,,
305,0.97,1920.385,1923.288,So we've done a lot of research on that.,35,,
306,0.97,1923.288,1930.361,"We have kind of a mapping system that we have created to let us see all of that, to make sure that is still the case.",35,,
307,0.97,1930.361,1939.17,But that allows us to actually have as many assets as possible open.,35,,
308,0.97,1939.17,1939.737,Depending upon condition.,35,,
309,0.97,1939.737,1951.049,"If I can just add, Theemergency center, they fold us into their planning operations.",36,,
310,0.97,1951.049,1954.152,"Notifications, planning, ongoing operations during every event.",36,,
311,0.97,1954.152,1964.062,"So whether it's snow, smoke, wind, we're always part of the conversation with them and plan with them as part of the response.",36,,
312,0.97,1964.062,1964.228,.,37,,
313,0.97,1964.228,1968.7,Do you have a follow up Council member Mosqueda?,38,,
314,0.97,1968.7,1969.4,No that's great.,39,,
315,0.97,1969.4,1973.805,I think that last comment Relevantly helps.,39,,
316,0.97,1973.805,1983.548,"My concern was that, it sounded like perhaps some closures were happening and then the emergency operations unit was being informed of that.",39,,
317,0.97,1983.548,1994.225,"So it might, my request is if those decisions about closures could be made with the emergency operation center so that we can have a better assessment of what the needs are.",39,,
318,0.97,1994.225,2004.068,But it sounds like from that last season those decisions are being made together versus just informing the emergency operation center.,39,,
319,0.97,2004.068,2004.335,Correct.,39,,
320,0.97,2004.335,2014.946,Usually what we try to do is let them know by a specific time.,40,,
321,0.97,2014.946,2018.783,"We give them a package, if we get sick calls in on why people can't get in.",40,,
322,0.97,2018.783,2020.451,Then we're able to tell them.,40,,
323,0.97,2020.451,2021.319,This is now the package.,40,,
324,0.97,2021.319,2022.72,It is going to be open today.,40,,
325,0.97,2022.72,2031.229,So there's always going to be a little bit of shuffling.,40,,
326,0.97,2031.229,2034.298,Depending upon conditions.,40,,
327,0.97,2034.298,2038.236,"Excellent, thank you so much Council member Herbold.",41,,
328,0.97,2038.236,2040.371,My cameras for being off camera.,42,,
329,0.97,2040.371,2049.714,Just to follow up that question and then we have a question on a completely different component of your staffing.,42,,
330,0.97,2049.714,2068.065,"As it relates specifically to extreme water events, I'm just, what I thought I heard you say was that there is sort of a threshold number of centers you try to assure are open.",42,,
331,0.97,2068.065,2074.505,"And it sounded like, there was a goal to keep a certain number of branches open.",42,,
332,0.97,2074.505,2080.144,And would love to know if I heard that correctly.,42,,
333,0.97,2080.144,2085.083,"I want to also, really thank you for the fact that early in the pandemic.",42,,
334,0.97,2085.083,2097.762,When so many businesses and other public places were entirely closed down.,42,,
335,0.97,2097.762,2103.968,The library really responded well for the need.,42,,
336,0.97,2103.968,2106.804,And you made Restrooms available for the 24 hour time.,42,,
337,0.97,2106.804,2110.208,I really want to thank you for that.,42,,
338,0.97,2110.208,2122.587,"In the instances where Perhaps you don't have sufficient staffing to shelter, sorry to staff the library and the library services for the purposes of the library.",42,,
339,0.97,2122.587,2131.996,Does your plan consider the possibility of opening as a shelter only not using your staff.,42,,
340,0.97,2131.996,2143.174,"But using staff who are able to serve folks staying in a shelter when we, like we do at City Hall.",42,,
341,0.97,2143.174,2165.83,"We open up City Hall as a shelter and we provide the staffing either through one of our partner Nonprofits or as we had increasingly, we've had city staff who have volunteered for an alternate assignment provide that staffing.",42,,
342,0.97,2165.83,2170.201,Does your plan consider the possibility of allowing for that.,42,,
343,0.97,2170.201,2185.516,"The answer to that particular question is no in the sense of if we are, if we're going to have a building open there's an expectation of the public that library services would be offered from that building.",43,,
344,0.97,2185.516,2193.558,S that is something that our staff are skilled to do.,43,,
345,0.97,2193.558,2207.872,And we wouldn't consider that during the course of our operations trying to maintain full services which would require obviously and skilled librarians.,43,,
346,0.97,2207.872,2208.072,Etc.,43,,
347,0.97,2208.072,2208.839,To maintain building operations.,43,,
348,0.97,2208.839,2220.418,"The other question I believe you asked is if we tried to maintain that tier of libraries being opened, a certain number and yes, we do.",43,,
349,0.97,2220.418,2232.663,There are times and conditions in which we believe the conditions are so bad that we can't get people in or we've already heard enough of the calls that we're not going to have enough people to open buildings.,43,,
350,0.97,2232.663,2240.237,So at that point I will make that call if need be that we would close operations for the entire day.,43,,
351,0.97,2240.237,2252.984,That's usually pretty extreme situations in which there's either extreme ice conditions.,43,,
352,0.97,2252.984,2261.826,Considerable accumulation snow and or our teams cannot come in to clear the parking lots or sidewalks to make it safe for the public to get in.,43,,
353,0.97,2261.826,2273.104,"We do appreciate that several folks, or several departments I should say helped us in this last session which again is that coordination with emergency management.",43,,
354,0.97,2273.104,2281.312,Sdot and Spu were able to help us with some of our parking lot clearing that we do not have the equipment for when it's a large scale or large accumulation of snow.,43,,
355,0.97,2281.312,2295.459,"So we do try to do that and most times I would say, we are open more than some of our colleagues in the region who are out in maybe rural King County and have a hard time opening their system.",43,,
356,0.97,2295.459,2302.466,But we try to always make sure that we're open as much as is possible.,43,,
357,0.97,2302.466,2302.833,Thank you.,44,,
358,0.97,2302.833,2308.673,I just want to follow up on your answer to my first question.,44,,
359,0.97,2308.673,2322.62,I don't know if I did not do a good job of explaining the question or if you did understand the question and the answer is just not one I was hoping to hear.,44,,
360,0.97,2322.62,2331.595,But I'm talking about a situation in which you have determined that you do not have the staffing to staff the library.,44,,
361,0.97,2331.595,2332.363,And you would otherwise close.,44,,
362,0.97,2332.363,2343.107,Would you consider having it open for purposes of the city addressing an extreme weather if it was staffed by somebody other than you.,44,,
363,0.97,2343.107,2346.21,"Just like, the city does for city hall.",44,,
364,0.97,2346.21,2355.986,"City Hall wasn't open, but to the public for the purpose of which, city hall is used to using the public is used to using City Hall.",44,,
365,0.97,2355.986,2360.825,But we had have had extreme weather and shelters there.,44,,
366,0.97,2360.825,2371.302,Just like some of our parks facilities when they haven't been open during the pandemic normally to the public for its normal use.,44,,
367,0.97,2371.302,2378.376,There is allowance for some use to address these extreme conditions.,44,,
368,0.97,2378.376,2385.149,In that particular case I would say many of our buildings would not lend themselves Tothat.,45,,
369,0.97,2385.149,2387.151,Just to the sheer size.,45,,
370,0.97,2387.151,2393.491,Most of them are small and don't have open spaces that would really accommodate that.,45,,
371,0.97,2393.491,2403.734,"I know that, shelter that, shelter space that is down at City Hall is fairly large and wide open.",45,,
372,0.97,2403.734,2405.436,It's not something that we've considered to this point.,45,,
373,0.97,2405.436,2410.141,I wasn't speaking of overnight use.,46,,
374,0.97,2410.141,2415.88,"I'm talking about, coming from the cold during the day.",46,,
375,0.97,2415.88,2427.525,Into the library as if they were library patrons but with the understanding that the space would be used a little bit differently in that case.,46,,
376,0.97,2427.525,2445.576,"I'm sorry for confusing, an apples and oranges comparison to a shelter for patrons who are unsheltered use your space during your regular business hours.",46,,
377,0.97,2445.576,2446.21,During extreme weather events.,46,,
378,0.97,2446.21,2467.565,"And I think I would come back to the first answer on that and that the concern would be if it was also quote open in that sense, if we're saying it's just going to be used for that purpose and not be considered open for the library which is how people would see it if people are going in and out of it.",47,,
379,0.97,2467.565,2473.07,That would be more problematic for us as they would have expectations of library services.,47,,
380,0.97,2473.07,2480.01,That would not be able to be offered and as I pointed out in some of our other conditions.,47,,
381,0.97,2480.01,2484.815,"We have staff trained, highly trained in a lot of Deescalation.",47,,
382,0.97,2484.815,2486.217,And security staff that we have too.,47,,
383,0.97,2486.217,2488.385,If they're not able to get in.,47,,
384,0.97,2488.385,2492.189,Then we also don't have those supports in place.,47,,
385,0.97,2492.189,2493.157,Understood.,48,,
386,0.97,2493.157,2493.724,Okay.,48,,
387,0.97,2493.724,2493.958,Thanks.,48,,
388,0.97,2493.958,2498.229,And just real quickly.,48,,
389,0.97,2498.229,2515.813,"My other staffing question, relates to the fact that in Mid- January we were all notified that many library branches would begin operating at reduced hours due to the pandemic impact on staffing levels.",48,,
390,0.97,2515.813,2522.386,And just wondering whether or not we have sort of an update.,48,,
391,0.97,2522.386,2530.928,I know we received an update last week that the library would be back to Prepandemic hours.,48,,
392,0.97,2530.928,2539.27,I know branches are returning to schedule if we have any more information about restoring full operating hours.,48,,
393,0.97,2539.27,2552.016,"Yes, we are happy to be able to note that we will be moving back to our regular hours about March 30th is what we're shooting for at this point.",49,,
394,0.97,2552.016,2554.084,So we're excited about that.,49,,
395,0.97,2554.084,2564.628,We're also excited that we're going to Incrementally bring back days to the spiral in the central library.,49,,
396,0.97,2564.628,2570.634,Which is another area which we've been lacking some staffing as we come back to speed.,49,,
397,0.97,2570.634,2583.08,"We hope to later this spring, then also move toward the additional levee hours as well.",49,,
398,0.97,2583.08,2589.787,If this all stays smooth as far as Covid we're excited about finally getting to that stage.,49,,
399,0.97,2589.787,2591.322,Thank you so much.,50,,
400,0.97,2591.322,2595.726,Thank you Council Memberherbold.,51,,

449,0.97,2882.946,2899.296,This is a systems approach to save an enormous amount of money by changing the outcome of the pay serve rather than intervening then repeating the same interventions over and over again without making things better for those being served or the other stake holders in the neighborhood.,59,,

510,0.97,3261.224,3275.939,Should the homeless advocates tell the forsaken homeless to come downtown to put up a sent because that's the only way they'll be Prioritized.,68,,
511,0.97,3275.939,3282.345,Because just cares has taken up the homeless allocation.,68,,
512,0.97,3282.345,3289.185,No offense to the homeless community but they only care about their front step.,68,,
513,0.97,3289.185,3306.836,I would like to point out that the central library has not done anything to mitigate the personal space of people have to go in there to be there for two hours and not be bothered by the flawed design.,68,,
514,0.97,3306.836,3308.238,All these people bothering you.,68,,
515,0.97,3308.238,3315.412,They're walking through the main hallway and that's where they want you to sit and read your newspaper.,68,,
516,0.97,3315.412,3324.154,Earlier today I had to get water because all the water is so Specked at the Pioneer buildings.,68,,
517,0.97,3324.154,3329.125,When I went to the library the one right by the FBI office and up the University.,68,,
518,0.97,3329.125,3339.936,There's some Dude that got spooked because I was walking faster than him.,68,,

521,0.97,3352.082,3370.2,And it's upsetting to me that I complain on just care because there's certain criminals who are under mining and committing crimes against humanity and they're destroying other people's lives that are yelling out and screaming every night at first and Cherry and Pioneer square and elsewhere.,68,,
522,0.97,3370.2,3374.504,And they're the root cause of our whole problem.,68,,
523,0.97,3374.504,3381.611,Who have a low level dollar amount who are being exempted from jail being considered a misdemeanor Violater.,68,,

573,0.97,3746.375,3747.276,I have a couple of remarks.,76,,
574,0.97,3747.276,3756.052,I think I just want to get into the presentation given that we've kind of kicked this back a little bit to respect the time of the Presenters.,76,,
575,0.97,3756.052,3773.236,But I cannot say enough about how great it's been to work with just care on some of the hardest and chronic homelessness and public safety challenges we've seen in the downtown core over the past several months of the pandemic.,76,,
576,0.97,3773.236,3783.613,I think it really goes to Thecore of what we see in the city and what people expect.,76,,
577,0.97,3783.613,3802.832,Which is incredible human need and incredible suffering and working with our partners in sending a response instead of letting these public problems fester in public use.,76,,
578,0.97,3802.832,3818.881,"I really appreciate the Adaptivity, and their constituent partner organizations in really Cobbling together what has been an indispensable program.",76,,
579,0.97,3818.881,3823.953,And their ability to do their part.,76,,
580,0.97,3823.953,3837.4,I would like to recognize Lisa Duggard who here from the organization along with her group of folks who work with her at just cares.,76,,

584,0.97,3863.96,3872.668,Thank you so much Council member Lewis and to Jacob who is sharing the deck.,77,,
585,0.97,3872.668,3879.175,I am going to just make a couple of opening comments and then we'll introduce Pamela.,77,,
586,0.97,3879.175,3890.953,And so I do hope that our partners from Dsa will be able to Chime in at the end of the formal presentation as well.,77,,
587,0.97,3890.953,3904.367,Just care is an alliance of multiple organizations in addition to the three active partners who's logos you see on that opening slide.,77,,
588,0.97,3904.367,3917.747,The approach was Cocreated by Council NC Seattle Club which have moved on to do other work but continue to be Originators of the partners of this work.,77,,
589,0.97,3917.747,3934.463,And we should acknowledge that this would never have come into being without the original support of King County Council members and the strong support of this Council in 2021.,77,,
590,0.97,3934.463,3938.634,This would have ended without initiative.,77,,
591,0.97,3938.634,3948.044,And we've had really fantastic support from the Mayor's office since that time.,77,,
592,0.97,3948.044,3993.022,"Just care came into being because as one of the folks and public comment observed in the middle of the pandemic, the early months of the pandemic, not only were many people who had been in con Tkpwra con Tkpwreu congregate shelters found themselves out on the streets and really as many other people found steady streams of relief, funding and support attached to the fact that they had had formal jobs or filed tax returns, had dependent children for which they filed tax returns.",77,,
593,0.97,3993.022,4004.9,Many other people were not recipients of the official release strategies that our country used to support people through the Covid pandemic and economic shut down.,77,,
594,0.97,4004.9,4022.518,And were forced into the elicit committee and as well dealing with the despair and sort of uncertainty about what the future held as so many people have experienced throughout this country.,77,,
595,0.97,4022.518,4025.321,Left really to alleviate those anxieties with drug use.,77,,
596,0.97,4025.321,4040.036,"And so, it was a miserable and very critical situation for many communities around the city.",77,,
597,0.97,4040.036,4046.142,And several of our Organizationsare based in Pioneer square right at the border with the district.,77,,
598,0.97,4046.142,4055.918,And could see these are long- standing issues with the level of Acuity was escalating to a degree that it obviously needed a response.,77,,
599,0.97,4055.918,4061.924,There were Covid relief funds flowing into our region.,77,,
600,0.97,4061.924,4065.828,But none being directed toward those living unsheltered.,77,,
601,0.97,4065.828,4079.275,So there was kind of a coalition of the willing of these organizations and the others that kick Ed this off with us.,77,,
602,0.97,4079.275,4088.451,And we decided that other cities throughout the country turn to use hotel rooms for people who had been chronically sheltered.,77,,
603,0.97,4088.451,4088.951,That's the background.,77,,
604,0.97,4088.951,4101.063,"I'm going to, call on my colleagues to do quick introductions just explaining their role in this partnership and then we'll go through the presentation.",77,,

633,0.97,4250.012,4260.155,Okay let me go to the next slide.,91,,
634,0.97,4260.155,4266.895,The just care model is unique because we respond with our partners.,92,,
635,0.97,4266.895,4273.202,We take time to understand their specific needs and we partner together to come up with solutions.,92,,
636,0.97,4273.202,4278.34,We also collaborate with many health providers who all have the goal of response.,92,,
637,0.97,4278.34,4284.513,Some of the people we collaborate with is host Seattle.,92,,
638,0.97,4284.513,4300.496,I wanted to add that we also collaborated really closely with neighborhoods and businesses and public officials.,93,,
639,0.97,4300.496,4301.13,Next slide.,94,,
640,0.97,4301.13,4305.567,The just care team focuses on twofold population.,95,,
641,0.97,4305.567,4316.512,The first would be at a approach of people who are at the site or passes through the site.,95,,
642,0.97,4316.512,4320.783,Getting to know who's there and getting to know the dynamic of the state.,95,,
643,0.97,4320.783,4327.556,Working with service providers to make the right referrals to long term assessment case management.,95,,
644,0.97,4327.556,4330.659,Whether that's outreach or other programs and other partners.,95,,
645,0.97,4330.659,4340.836,They also focus on that long term support inside of the hotels for the folks that fit those and have accommodations with the downtown population.,95,,
646,0.97,4340.836,4350.779,They're often very complicated like all the fields mentioned here but they're also complicated with their Comorbidity and Covid.,95,,
647,0.97,4350.779,4353.215,Where a lot of resources have been localized downtown.,95,,
648,0.97,4353.215,4356.385,Alot of them closed their doors but that's the area that folks know.,95,,
649,0.97,4356.385,4363.158,They know where to go to get those resources in those areas which has led to a huge accumulation of people in that area.,95,,
650,0.97,4363.158,4379.908,Plus with other areas being far away and inaccessible either through public transportation or just in general Inassessable to people who are living in that County.,95,,
651,0.97,4379.908,4389.418,"Satisfy not just their sheltering need but food access, community, legal access if they need to go to court that are just easier to get to in the downtown corridor.",95,,
652,0.97,4389.418,4396.792,So they are also impacted by a lot of different neighborhood Dynamics as you know.,95,,
653,0.97,4396.792,4411.106,"Like the little Saigon, waterfront, all those different spaces that are differently impacted by economic development as well as business needs and the people who have historically been in those spaces.",95,,
654,0.97,4411.106,4411.974,"And next slide, please.",96,,

657,0.97,4428.891,4442.504,For the model we provide at the downtown Seattle hotel we really focus on addressing social health.,98,,

662,0.97,4483.679,4486.315,And we increased access to care in lieu of that.,99,,
663,0.97,4486.315,4502.497,All of our participants in just care are enrolled or reactivated in apple health which is the Washington Medicaid plans and we also coordinate with the longer term care by helping folks access primary home.,99,,
664,0.97,4502.497,4510.172,"So that after their time with us is over, that you still have access to that longer term care.",99,,
665,0.97,4510.172,4518.914,We coordinate care with specialty care clinics and support an access to medication treatment for substance use disorders when appropriate.,99,,
666,0.97,4518.914,4526.788,And then we also provide harm reduction education to all of our participants including Overdose prevention.,99,,

680,0.97,4628.123,4676.671,"I just want to highlight that many not all of the participants in just care have pending or old court involvement and as courts shut down in 2020 but as they have come back Online we're seeing, old cases sort of crop up so that they interrupt people's path to Stabilization and recovery and we coordinate with the support of the Seattle city attorney's office and the King County's prosecutors office their resolution of those cases address warrants and make sure that people don't have these outstanding impediments to stabilization.",103,,

744,0.97,5098.059,5103.598,A by name list is a tool that supports resource allocation and team coordination.,115,,
745,0.97,5103.598,5111.773,And it is used in the just care process and also by reach at other Encampments and in housing case conferences.,115,,
746,0.97,5111.773,5132.06,A by name list allows us to Ebg to equitably understand and access the individuals who are living outside and tailor program design.,115,,
747,0.97,5132.06,5136.364,It also creates a space for information sharing.,115,,

756,0.97,5207.569,5212.24,Really appreciate the slide.,116,,
757,0.97,5212.24,5215.543,I think it's really instructive for our discussion.,116,,
758,0.97,5215.543,5221.683,Can you talk a little bit about these equity and hope Icons on the bottom here.,116,,
759,0.97,5221.683,5230.658,In terms of what those symbolize and what those placements are.,116,,
760,0.97,5230.658,5231.593,"Yes, of course.",117,,
761,0.97,5231.593,5237.966,Equity and Colead are two of the lodging resources available through just care.,117,,
762,0.97,5237.966,5248.676,"When we are, when the field team is working to determine the best lodging resource match for an individual.",117,,
763,0.97,5248.676,5252.647,These are the resources that are considered.,117,,
764,0.97,5252.647,5262.757,These Icons here represent two of the availability shelter models.,117,,
765,0.97,5262.757,5263.591,Through provided through just care.,117,,
766,0.97,5263.591,5268.997,We can go to the next slide unless there's another question.,118,,
767,0.97,5268.997,5270.064,That's fine for now.,119,,
768,0.97,5270.064,5273.134,"What we'll, actually let me ask just a brief follow up.",119,,
769,0.97,5273.134,5288.016,Does hope indicate the hope team resources so will that be more like tiny House village placements and things of that nature?,119,,
770,0.97,5288.016,5290.752,Yes it does.,120,,
771,0.97,5290.752,5291.019,Great.,121,,
772,0.97,5291.019,5291.252,Thanks.,121,,
773,0.97,5291.252,5293.021,Whitney.,122,,
774,0.97,5293.021,5295.857,So to kind of take that question into consideration.,122,,
775,0.97,5295.857,5302.53,That is like a really helpful part of the by name list.,122,,
776,0.97,5302.53,5308.67,We know that everybody is not going to go to the hotel.,122,,
777,0.97,5308.67,5320.014,That's why the by name is the best for triage because we know we don't have enough resources.,122,,
778,0.97,5320.014,5332.66,We're put in the position to go to Prioritize.,122,,
779,0.97,5332.66,5339.934,As well as identifying what would be the best fit for we done have enough of.,122,,
780,0.97,5339.934,5340.768,Like tiny home villages.,122,,
781,0.97,5340.768,5344.305,That would be a great opportunity for folks but we don't have enough of.,122,,
782,0.97,5344.305,5350.244,Also identifying the resources that would be the best but in generally do not exist.,122,,
783,0.97,5350.244,5353.481,Doing similar binding lists in other areas.,122,,
784,0.97,5353.481,5361.456,"For example, if we're looking at the types of support requested.",122,,
785,0.97,5361.456,5367.362,"The intersection of physical health, substance abuse, there aren't shelters that would fit somebody with that.",122,,
786,0.97,5367.362,5371.165,There aren't shelters that have Ada Assessable.,122,,
787,0.97,5371.165,5379.64,If someone has a huge physical health need barrier that resource does not exist for them.,122,,
788,0.97,5379.64,5397.658,"So using the binding in a systemic way, that's a systemic failure that continues to keep them in the system of homelessness is an issue that's why we use the by name issue.",122,,
789,0.97,5397.658,5401.929,I just wanted to highlight some of the numbers.,122,,
790,0.97,5401.929,5406.934,Here 1/3 of the encampment experience five years of homelessness.,122,,
791,0.97,5406.934,5407.802,That's a significant point.,122,,
792,0.97,5407.802,5408.536,Because it changes.,122,,
793,0.97,5408.536,5411.839,If you're looking at it less than a year of homelessness.,122,,
794,0.97,5411.839,5424.385,The barriers that they've encountered and the trauma they've encountered is different than someone who has gotten five years.,122,,
795,0.97,5424.385,5427.922,Is going to give an indication of the the Dynamics.,122,,
796,0.97,5427.922,5430.892,The system have been there homeless for over five years.,122,,
797,0.97,5430.892,5441.335,There's a good chance to hit on every single kind of the mark of the system that they may need.,122,,
798,0.97,5441.335,5445.106,Honest and open about their wants and desire for substance use support.,122,,
799,0.97,5445.106,5449.844,And that's really based on the time base relationship based approach.,122,,
800,0.97,5449.844,5453.281,Where do we get that kind of honest to begin with.,122,,
801,0.97,5453.281,5455.449,As many of you saw.,122,,
802,0.97,5455.449,5462.29,Raises a terrible use but one of those marks is that when people ask about Oh what is your substance use?,122,,
803,0.97,5462.29,5471.165,People interpret it as I'm going to be further Stigmatized for this behavior and I'm going to answer dishonestly.,122,,
804,0.97,5471.165,5481.342,That's why people get Xed out because people don't believe the system is going to meet their needs the way they want and need.,122,,
805,0.97,5481.342,5485.613,I think it's significant that over 1/4 of the population are saying I do want this help.,122,,
806,0.97,5485.613,5491.853,"Tonya, do you have a question?",122,,
807,0.97,5491.853,5494.121,"I do, thanks.",123,,
808,0.97,5494.121,5494.889,Tanya Kim with Hsd.,123,,
809,0.97,5494.889,5508.269,Wanted to clarify since the hope team is a part of Hsd that we Codo have Ada Assessable resources I just wanted to offer that clarification.,123,,
810,0.97,5508.269,5508.903,Whether it's ready available.,123,,
811,0.97,5508.903,5512.64,This isn't about the hope team that wanted to offer some clarification there.,123,,
812,0.97,5512.64,5516.077,Thank you so much.,124,,
813,0.97,5516.077,5516.377,Absolutely.,124,,
814,0.97,5516.377,5516.777,What's available.,124,,
815,0.97,5516.777,5520.248,It's not always readily available for people.,124,,
816,0.97,5520.248,5526.354,I think we can move on to the next slide then.,125,,
817,0.97,5526.354,5527.154,Moving to Dave.,125,,
818,0.97,5527.154,5528.089,Prepare for moving day.,126,,
819,0.97,5528.089,5532.026,This is about when our days get longer.,126,,
820,0.97,5532.026,5536.731,We're playing Tetris with our client specific needs and limited resources.,126,,
821,0.97,5536.731,5541.102,We're assigning hotel rooms and collaborating with hotel.,126,,
822,0.97,5541.102,5544.272,Collaborating with teams like hope if they're available.,126,,
823,0.97,5544.272,5553.147,Our field team goes out days before to make sure that everyone is aware of the new plan and where they're going and to make sure they have all the supplies necessary to move.,126,,
824,0.97,5553.147,5564.158,The morning of the move They'Rebright and early and going throughout the day until the person is inside and there's a plan.,126,,
825,0.97,5564.158,5567.228,And our job is not done that day.,126,,
826,0.97,5567.228,5572.733,We do communicate with folks at other sites.,126,,
827,0.97,5572.733,5578.406,Also we include Thesurrounding neighborhoods and businesses.,127,,
828,0.97,5578.406,5586.681,Help coordinate site activation when our work is complete.,127,,
829,0.97,5586.681,5594.555,We stay in contact so that we can discuss a contact for when we expect that to be complete.,127,,
830,0.97,5594.555,5595.957,Just keep folks aware.,127,,
831,0.97,5595.957,5601.462,Keep attending public meetings so people know we're making progress.,127,,
832,0.97,5601.462,5611.939,"The outreach team consistently visits business, surrounding businesses and the, we go into the small businesses just to keep people aware of Hey this is the work we're doing today.",127,,
833,0.97,5611.939,5619.447,And this is the time line we expect.,127,,
834,0.97,5619.447,5627.421,And ask folks who don't take action that would interfere with the work that we're doing.,127,,
835,0.97,5627.421,5635.262,And just so folks are aware that something is going to happen and there is going to be Aresolution to some of their concerns.,127,,
836,0.97,5635.262,5641.702,We also coordinate with Dsa and parks and recreation for debris removal afterward.,127,,
837,0.97,5641.702,5650.745,"So that is, also really important.",127,,
838,0.97,5650.745,5651.879,Next slide please.,128,,
839,0.97,5651.879,5668.763,"So, looking on the left, you will see that, the objective of this approach is to find a plan for everybody or as close to everybody as we possibly can get.",129,,
840,0.97,5668.763,5676.137,And over the space of time from October 2020 to March 2021.,129,,
841,0.97,5676.137,5689.583,"You see the distribution of destinations that people, that people were able to take up by and large most people moved into a just care hotel.",129,,
842,0.97,5689.583,5704.398,There were a tiny number of people who were offered and declined and they were specific often power Dynamics there.,129,,
843,0.97,5704.398,5710.738,Involving Exploitive situations.,129,,
844,0.97,5710.738,5726.353,There are a few people for whom the resources we have to offer not consistent with their needs and where we weren't able to find a match.,129,,
845,0.97,5726.353,5729.857,But as was just noted.,129,,
846,0.97,5729.857,5733.461,"Throughout that period, when necessary and when hope resources were available.",129,,
847,0.97,5733.461,5743.003,The hope team was fantastic at supplementing what we could offer through the just care shelters.,129,,
848,0.97,5743.003,5756.817,"So, and you see a distribution of those who received help through the project that overwhelmingly the recipients of placement resources were by plaque.",129,,
849,0.97,5756.817,5765.559,On the right hand side we see the park story.,129,,
850,0.97,5765.559,5775.536,"The distribution of people who left City Hall Park, reflecting that almost everyone had a plan to move inside.",129,,
851,0.97,5775.536,5782.143,That they accepted and that plan was completed when each of those people had a plan.,129,,
852,0.97,5782.143,5790.751,It was only that plan that we had finalizing the time line and looking for debris removal for people that chose to leave behind them.,129,,
853,0.97,5790.751,5792.019,We could move on.,129,,
854,0.97,5792.019,5796.023,I think we can move to slides down.,129,,
855,0.97,5796.023,5802.596,"These are just, photographs of people inside and what the space looks afterward.",129,,
856,0.97,5802.596,5809.303,We just have five quick slides showing some examples of this work.,129,,
857,0.97,5809.303,5809.537,Tierra.,129,,
858,0.97,5809.537,5814.842,"Yeah, so here are a couple of photos of the work before and after.",130,,
859,0.97,5814.842,5822.817,This one is on an extension and main.,130,,
860,0.97,5822.817,5823.317,You can advance please.,130,,
861,0.97,5823.317,5830.724,And then Pioneer park which we worked on in October.,130,,
862,0.97,5830.724,5831.058,Next please.,130,,
863,0.97,5831.058,5836.13,Fifth and King where we worked on October 2021.,130,,
864,0.97,5836.13,5841.101,And King Street station.,130,,
865,0.97,5841.101,5845.339,"And that was, in February.",130,,
866,0.97,5845.339,5846.607,Fourth and Pike.,130,,
867,0.97,5846.607,5848.008,February as well.,130,,
868,0.97,5848.008,5854.849,Then I will call Kirby just to add some comments about the work at those sites and observation.,130,,
869,0.97,5854.849,5862.389,Yeah I just wanted to mention that the King street was a really great example of how we collaborated and adjusted.,131,,
870,0.97,5862.389,5871.632,We have a higher level of immigrant clients there so we had to respond to their specific needs and our fourth site which was our last big project.,131,,
871,0.97,5871.632,5873.5,We have a big partnership with Med clean team.,131,,
872,0.97,5873.5,5877.238,Saw what we were doing and jumped in to collaborate.,131,,
873,0.97,5877.238,5877.671,Thanks Kirby.,132,,
874,0.97,5877.671,5886.413,I should just mention that last site fourth and Pike in the last slide was our last site to make placements from.,132,,
875,0.97,5886.413,5903.097,I know it's not grammatical but we itemized new placements because we only have a few more months of funding left and we will have to find an exit program for people to move on in a secure way.,132,,
876,0.97,5903.097,5909.703,"And if we bring people on from now forward, it will literally not be possible to do that.",132,,
877,0.97,5909.703,5920.014,"This is a summary of the equity team's impact, Victor.",132,,
878,0.97,5920.014,5923.183,So to provide some content.,133,,
879,0.97,5923.183,5924.218,We have equity just care.,133,,
880,0.97,5924.218,5933.761,Just to along with the work we do that really reflects this equity to the number of Lgbtq.,133,,
881,0.97,5933.761,5941.268,With our services are provided at a downtown Seattle hotel that I Referenced earlier.,133,,
882,0.97,5941.268,5945.639,Our hotel has the most number of clients.,133,,
883,0.97,5945.639,5959.253,The unit of equity is we set clients with the most highest of team mental health and substance use is the issues with chronic mental health.,133,,
884,0.97,5959.253,5965.225,Implementation in November 2020 as of today we have stepped over 147 Unduplicated clients.,133,,
885,0.97,5965.225,5974.868,And to me I just want us to take a moment to reflect on impact we have made in such a shot of time.,133,,
886,0.97,5974.868,5981.575,"The clients that are with us, as of today we have 71 currently clients at our hotel.",133,,
887,0.97,5981.575,5986.847,As of today 67 clients have been assisted with housing support.,133,,
888,0.97,5986.847,5997.091,The just care program is part of their transition.,133,,
889,0.97,5997.091,6000.494,I would like to say we've assisted 67.,133,,
890,0.97,6000.494,6006.6,As of today 50 clients have Transitioned and have moved on to permanent housing.,133,,
891,0.97,6006.6,6008.969,Over all it's going to be 63.,133,,
892,0.97,6008.969,6024.952,I think the unique thing about this program is the 24/7 care that is provided by the team.,133,,
893,0.97,6024.952,6028.522,"Behavior professional, substance abuse professionals and practitioner nurses.",133,,
894,0.97,6028.522,6030.024,It's a very skilled team.,133,,
895,0.97,6030.024,6034.628,And Coincidentally all of us in this program we're a Poc.,133,,
896,0.97,6034.628,6037.865,Some of us have life experience.,133,,
897,0.97,6037.865,6050.778,We also have from the Lgbtq community that allows us to have the clearance to help the clients we serve that really focus on that relationship.,133,,
898,0.97,6050.778,6053.58,In building the trust and dealing with equity.,133,,
899,0.97,6053.58,6060.454,"The other thing I want to note, we've already spoken.",133,,
900,0.97,6060.454,6067.594,We're really glad we can partner with Wbc when there's a need for escalation service.,133,,
901,0.97,6067.594,6074.401,Normal approach is to use a community devotion approach.,133,,
902,0.97,6074.401,6074.868,Versus law enforce.,133,,
903,0.97,6074.868,6084.478,Because a lot of our clients as we talk are Lgbtq which already have not very positive experience with law enforcement.,133,,
904,0.97,6084.478,6092.886,As well as they already have some trauma.,133,,
905,0.97,6092.886,6105.632,I'm Realitily glad that we have a partnership with this organization.,133,,
906,0.97,6105.632,6114.541,"The fact that Wdc has provided this Nonpolice plan, SPD has done a great level of support.",134,,
907,0.97,6114.541,6125.352,Their willingness to coordinate so that we're not stepping on each other's operations and work has been exceptional.,134,,
908,0.97,6125.352,6134.728,And the more SPD personnel have become aware of the ability of this team to work on many situations within the past they would have been called to responds to.,134,,
909,0.97,6134.728,6143.136,The more support we've seen and so we really appreciate that partnership.,134,,
910,0.97,6143.136,6143.403,Dr. Zen.,134,,
911,0.97,6143.403,6143.77,Thank you.,135,,
912,0.97,6143.77,6159.786,"So we find the people that we serve at the intersection of homelessness, complex, medical and behave behavioral health need.",135,,
913,0.97,6159.786,6165.759,Has served 159 clients with legal system involvement.,135,,
914,0.97,6165.759,6166.793,As well.,135,,
915,0.97,6166.793,6174.401,Currently we have 106 Coactive participants who are Locateed in four lodging sites in the city of Seattle.,135,,
916,0.97,6174.401,6188.015,"And they all sites include highly intensive case management and you can see in the slide, 60 hours of case management.",135,,
917,0.97,6188.015,6193.12,90 plus service encounters by the responders.,135,,
918,0.97,6193.12,6199.426,"This also incorporates a really integral part of safety, support through Deescalation.",135,,
919,0.97,6199.426,6205.265,Through one of our partners the Wdc safety team.,135,,
920,0.97,6205.265,6220.18,When we have currently 23 participants connected with emergency housing vouchers in order to support them with their transition into permanent housing.,135,,
921,0.97,6220.18,6221.148,Next slide.,136,,
922,0.97,6221.148,6238.398,Just to reiterate that as Impactful and successful as this partnership has proven to be and we've made many modifications and we approach as needed over the next 18 months.,136,,
923,0.97,6238.398,6262.756,"There's gaps that we collectively try to raise up and that we ourselves cannot solve for there are some individuals out there who are not, either going to be Civilly committed or if they are, they're going to come right back out on the back end of that process without any real progress in addressing these needs.",136,,
924,0.97,6262.756,6265.425,Mental illness is definitely a gap.,136,,
925,0.97,6265.425,6277.804,"There are some people, a small number who cannot be safely although we've tried and try to give everybody a chance.",136,,
926,0.97,6277.804,6286.38,There are some people who have not been able to work with the safety requirements of this sort of community living.,136,,
927,0.97,6286.38,6289.816,Many of those people though remain in touch with the team.,136,,
928,0.97,6289.816,6297.19,"And have been placed again in the future or our community supporters, even if they leave.",136,,
929,0.97,6297.19,6301.361,Again this is a small number of people.,136,,
930,0.97,6301.361,6308.135,"To connect people to care, folks are not going to stay with us forever and that's not the model.",136,,
931,0.97,6308.135,6320.013,Connecting people to care involves encountering and trying to resolve some eligibility barriers to benefit particularly for the immigrant population.,136,,
932,0.97,6320.013,6328.522,Ten U.S. funding this program has been operating without assurance of continued support for most of its existence.,136,,
933,0.97,6328.522,6337.631,And has also had to move locations numerous types as hotels went back to commercial traffic.,136,,
934,0.97,6337.631,6343.136,In addition all the other functions the teams had to be like a moving company.,136,,
935,0.97,6343.136,6354.915,It would be you know we would be able to elevate and intensify our impact if we just knew we were going to be doing this work for a longer period of time and knew where we would be doing the work.,136,,
936,0.97,6354.915,6364.658,But Covid impact has hit our team one of our Qt members is ill and not with us today for that reason.,136,,
937,0.97,6364.658,6374.735,"And like almost everybody during the Omicron surge, we faced staffing impacts that made it tough to continue the work.",136,,
938,0.97,6374.735,6381.408,"And have needed to work on, work force incentives to make sure we can recruit and retain staff.",136,,
939,0.97,6381.408,6385.946,We haven't been able to do that.,136,,
940,0.97,6385.946,6388.014,Conflicting initiatives and approaches.,136,,
941,0.97,6388.014,6397.758,"This just flags that, this approach requires essentially like sight control that what people are being told is consistent and that we are able to follow through.",136,,
942,0.97,6397.758,6430.457,And when various entities are kind of Baring down on the same site with the different plan of action it can get confusing and can impede trust development so hopefully going forward there will be a really solid alignment of approach among the various entities that have been assigned responsibility to respond to Unshelt Erld sheltered homelessness.,136,,
943,0.97,6430.457,6433.76,"We're done, we just have a beautiful quote from Victor.",136,,
944,0.97,6433.76,6438.265,I don't have to worry about what I have to wake up to.,137,,
945,0.97,6438.265,6439.933,"When I meet someone, they're always there.",137,,
946,0.97,6439.933,6446.706,I care about myself more than I did before I came here.,137,,
947,0.97,6446.706,6451.311,"My anxiety is so high because of my dad dying, my mom dying.",137,,
948,0.97,6451.311,6453.246,Me being 11 years old.,137,,
949,0.97,6453.246,6459.453,Since I've been here my guard has been always down.,137,,
950,0.97,6459.453,6459.82,It's a miracle.,137,,
951,0.97,6459.82,6464.124,"To be truthful, it is the only program I did not get kicked out.",137,,
952,0.97,6464.124,6470.797,"If I were not be here, there would be a lot more people be sound dead, a lot more people overdosed.",137,,
953,0.97,6470.797,6475.769,They get me stronger when I get into another place I won't be up from this again.,137,,
954,0.97,6475.769,6476.136,I feel ready.,137,,
955,0.97,6476.136,6483.21,And this one of the hundreds of clients that we have served that have made an impact.,137,,
956,0.97,6483.21,6487.881,I really urge the city Council to think about a way to maintain this program.,137,,
957,0.97,6487.881,6492.619,A model of care that has proven to be effective.,137,,
958,0.97,6492.619,6503.263,"To treat our unsheltered clients who can be a brother, a sister, a family member, who need the care that they need with respect, dignity and compassion.",137,,
959,0.97,6503.263,6503.563,Thank you.,137,,
960,0.97,6503.563,6503.63,.,137,,
961,0.97,6504.064,6507.667,"Victor, thank you so much for those closing words.",138,,
962,0.97,6507.667,6518.478,And thank you Lisa and the other Presenters for that come comprehensive presentation.,138,,
963,0.97,6518.478,6528.688,I cannot agree more with that sentiment and really think it's a good transition to start moving toward how we may accomplish that.,138,,
964,0.97,6528.688,6539.099,"Before we do so, I want to recognize Bryan candid to give some remarks from the metropolitan improvement district.",138,,
965,0.97,6539.099,6546.239,I do so because I want to recognize one of the things I love so much about working with just care and this program.,138,,
966,0.97,6546.239,6551.177,Is the coalition building in the neighborhoods where just care is active.,138,,
967,0.97,6551.177,6555.548,To not be Siloed to take advantage of other resources.,138,,
968,0.97,6555.548,6556.249,To build partnerships.,138,,
969,0.97,6556.249,6571.932,And to win hearts and minds that other approaches are effective that you know that they can get everybody's needs met in a way that centers what all of us want to see.,138,,
970,0.97,6571.932,6579.005,And you know the Dsa has been Anintegral part of this work and the Mid-Has been an integral part of this work.,138,,
971,0.97,6579.005,6587.347,I'm thrilled to have Bryan here to speak to that before we Pivot to the next part of the discussion.,138,,
972,0.97,6587.347,6590.85,"And Bryan, now would be the time and thank you for being here.",138,,
973,0.97,6590.85,6591.685,Please take it away.,138,,
974,0.97,6591.685,6596.022,Thanks for the opportunity to share and talk about our experiences.,139,,
975,0.97,6596.022,6597.924,And our support for just care.,139,,
976,0.97,6597.924,6602.963,It's really hard to follow that presentation.,139,,
977,0.97,6602.963,6607.3,I've our team has worked with them over the past two years and they do incredible work.,139,,
978,0.97,6607.3,6614.541,And I do want to say starting from my experience working on quality of life issues in downtown over the last ten years.,139,,
979,0.97,6614.541,6615.675,We know that suites don't work.,139,,
980,0.97,6615.675,6618.311,Over the years I've seen people displaced.,139,,
981,0.97,6618.311,6629.99,I've seen people look contact with their caseworkers and their support systems and I've seen people lose vital personal possessions like IDS and Medications.,139,,
982,0.97,6629.99,6632.325,What does work is the just care program.,139,,
983,0.97,6632.325,6636.997,"In all the time, working in public realm work especially in downtown.",139,,
984,0.97,6636.997,6643.97,Just care is the most effective program I've seen in terms of Encampments.,139,,
985,0.97,6643.97,6652.012,Moving people indoors into supportive environments and to helping to stabilize individuals to be able to adjust the course of their life.,139,,
986,0.97,6652.012,6655.248,Several of our Mid-Teams have worked with just care.,139,,
987,0.97,6655.248,6660.12,Our outreach team has assisted at some locations in making connections with clients.,139,,
988,0.97,6660.12,6674.067,Our staff has also worked itself to locations to help connect just care with properties Andbusinesses that are located with Encampments.,139,,
989,0.97,6674.067,6678.371,That has been a vital part of the work we do.,139,,
990,0.97,6678.371,6687.347,"Just understanding the impact on local businesses, on local properties and making that extra step to sometimes involve them and making sure they're aware of what's going on.",139,,
991,0.97,6687.347,6694.988,And then just care is also partnered with our clean team to assist with trash removal as people are moving into housing.,139,,
992,0.97,6694.988,6709.169,"And just one other thing I would like to mention, some of the frustration that we've seen over the past two years, is just the limits of funding as well as the impacts of a program that has to be run with short term contracts.",139,,
993,0.97,6709.169,6713.973,With funding I've seen just care be able to move really quickly and operate its scale.,139,,
994,0.97,6713.973,6720.213,Once they hit the limits of their funding they're often just stuck in a holding pattern.,139,,
995,0.97,6720.213,6726.486,I'm grateful they've had their contracts removed several times but similar to the situation they're in right now.,139,,
996,0.97,6726.486,6729.022,We've seen with looming end base.,139,,
997,0.97,6729.022,6733.46,They often find themselves in position to not be able to take on more clients.,139,,
998,0.97,6733.46,6736.863,Just looking at that possible forced exit at the end of a contract.,139,,
999,0.97,6736.863,6740.5,If anything I would just like to reiterate.,139,,
1000,0.97,6740.5,6748.742,I've never seen a program as effective as just care in their ability to move people in quickly and to do so at scale.,139,,
1001,0.97,6748.742,6750.777,I very much appreciate their work and partnership.,139,,
1002,0.97,6750.777,6759.419,I hope this program can be funded and for the long term.,139,,
1003,0.97,6759.419,6759.752,So thank you.,139,,
1004,0.97,6759.752,6764.557,"Ryan, thank you so much for those strong statements.",140,,
1005,0.97,6764.557,6778.805,I really appreciate you Prefacing your remarks about the difference between traditional Sweeps and the work that is being done by this group here and the contrast and effectiveness.,140,,
1006,0.97,6778.805,6783.777,Because I have seen the exact same result that you're speaking to.,140,,
1007,0.97,6783.777,6794.053,"And you know, I mean when people see it and interact with it it converts them to this way of doing business and this way of helping our neighbors.",140,,
1008,0.97,6794.053,6802.829,"So, with that, I do have a memo from central staff that I think a lot of people have been reviewed.",140,,
1009,0.97,6802.829,6808.835,Have reviewed it's been publicly posted and we have Jeff Similars from central staff.,140,,
1010,0.97,6808.835,6816.075,Bryan your remarks are an excellent Pivot to the thing we all agree on and how can Wefigure out how to do it.,140,,
1011,0.97,6816.075,6824.684,Which is can we give this program the support and the resource necessary to avoid funding clips.,140,,
1012,0.97,6824.684,6827.82,To avoid delays in service.,140,,
1013,0.97,6827.82,6829.689,To guarantee continuity of service.,140,,
1014,0.97,6829.689,6833.126,And what would that cause for the city to take that on.,140,,
1015,0.97,6833.126,6836.029,Then I want to caution at the beginning.,140,,
1016,0.97,6836.029,6837.163,Jeff will walk through some work.,140,,
1017,0.97,6837.163,6842.135,That we did just to kind of get an idea of what it would cost to scope it.,140,,
1018,0.97,6842.135,6845.672,"You know these, numbers are going to be preliminary.",140,,
1019,0.97,6845.672,6853.58,"We you know, we can also have a discussion about how this would go on.",140,,
1020,0.97,6853.58,6857.45,No funding source has been identified just for members of the general public.,140,,
1021,0.97,6857.45,6867.293,Just before we have those discussions we do need to just come together and scope what are we talking about being honest in terms of the numbers and the potential hit that it would have to our budget.,140,,
1022,0.97,6867.293,6872.665,So I just want to give that context in the beginning.,140,,
1023,0.97,6872.665,6875.902,Jeff will go through this analysis and break it down.,140,,
1024,0.97,6875.902,6882.575,And we can have a bit of a conversation where we open it up to colleagues for questions.,140,,
1025,0.97,6882.575,6886.98,And we can also do questions from the Dsa and staff at that time.,140,,
1026,0.97,6886.98,6890.416,"Jeff, why don't I turn it over to you.",140,,
1027,0.97,6890.416,6891.885,For the record.,141,,
1028,0.97,6891.885,6892.952,"Council, central staff.",141,,
1029,0.97,6892.952,6899.926,The chair at central staff to prepare different numbers in advance of the committee meeting.,141,,
1030,0.97,6899.926,6912.538,I will just talk to what the three are and the data points.,141,,
1031,0.97,6912.538,6918.244,The first was what would be the cost for 150 rooms at cost.,141,,
1032,0.97,6918.244,6927.82,And what would be capital investment assuming there wouldn't be a one time Assessable.,141,,
1033,0.97,6927.82,6936.296,And the funding to maintain just care on an annual basis going forward.,141,,
1034,0.97,6936.296,6946.372,I want to acknowledge that I work with Angela who is also on the line.,141,,
1035,0.97,6946.372,6961.954,"We utilized information from the health and funding, sales tax acquisitions that the county has been providing.",141,,
1036,0.97,6961.954,6964.023,We've acquired other types of business.,141,,
1037,0.97,6964.023,6969.262,And you can see the number of units and the configuration.,141,,
1038,0.97,6969.262,6972.699,Some have kitchens some don't.,141,,
1039,0.97,6972.699,6984.444,You can see 12 to $30 million if we just use what would be the average cost and we did simple math.,141,,
1040,0.97,6984.444,6991.651,It costs $32 million to acquire 150 hotel shelter beds.,141,,
1041,0.97,6991.651,6999.492,The associated debt service then recalled this would assume a 20 year bond issuance.,141,,
1042,0.97,6999.492,7004.597,About a 3% type of issuance.,141,,
1043,0.97,7004.597,7005.131,4% interest rate.,141,,
1044,0.97,7005.131,7008.501,The annual depth service we're estimating.,141,,
1045,0.97,7008.501,7011.204,Using those numbers I just gave.,141,,
1046,0.97,7011.204,7012.005,The 21 million and 31 million.,141,,
1047,0.97,7012.005,7015.641,The debt would be $1.6 million.,141,,
1048,0.97,7015.641,7017.343,That would be for 100 beds.,141,,
1049,0.97,7017.343,7022.782,For 150 beds it would be $2.4 million.,141,,
1050,0.97,7022.782,7024.083,So if you're keeping track at home.,141,,
1051,0.97,7024.083,7026.486,We will get to the next slide in a minute.,141,,
1052,0.97,7026.486,7035.428,Then the last data point was operational funding and I want to thank everybody from the just care teams for everyone who assist in this.,141,,
1053,0.97,7035.428,7042.435,Making sure we have all the right numbers and compare against raising contracts and things like that.,141,,
1054,0.97,7042.435,7049.175,It's estimated that operations 100 beds would cost $4.9 million.,141,,
1055,0.97,7049.175,7050.143,7.3 million for 150 beds.,141,,
1056,0.97,7050.143,7055.681,"So now if you're keeping track at home the bottom line would be, the that for 150 beds.",141,,
1057,0.97,7055.681,7066.893,Which is comparable to what just care currently operates as its main base would be about $10 million in annual funding and on and ongoing basis.,141,,
1058,0.97,7066.893,7068.461,With that I will yield back to you.,141,,
1059,0.97,7068.461,7069.896,Thank you so much Jeff.,142,,
1060,0.97,7069.896,7072.832,I do want to note real quick too.,142,,
1061,0.97,7072.832,7078.237,Just because we don't really know how the legislative session in Olympia is going to end.,142,,
1062,0.97,7078.237,7082.108,We could be hopeful about how that's going to go.,142,,
1063,0.97,7082.108,7094.087,But for this exercise as Jeff indicated I did sort of assume what if we had to buy some kind of Hoteling asset on our own end without any support.,142,,
1064,0.97,7094.087,7103.196,My understanding is if the state does come through with the level of acquisition support we're anticipating.,142,,
1065,0.97,7103.196,7109.902,That could be a potential source of Resourcing that would avoid the entire potential need for this whole bonding exercise.,142,,
1066,0.97,7109.902,7122.949,"But I did just want to for the general public that's viewing right, I just want to make sure that we did a little diligence on that operation assuming a responsible worse case scenario of external support.",142,,
1067,0.97,7122.949,7127.019,"Which you know, in terms of what we got back.",142,,
1068,0.97,7127.019,7130.656,Still makes it an attainable goal to keep this going.,142,,
1069,0.97,7130.656,7137.363,"So, with that, I'm happy to turn it over for questions from colleagues.",142,,
1070,0.97,7137.363,7139.599,It's been a long presentation.,142,,
1071,0.97,7139.599,7140.199,I appreciate your patience.,142,,
1072,0.97,7140.199,7146.639,Given the stake of what we're talking about it's worth it to really dig in here.,142,,
1073,0.97,7146.639,7155.181,Does anyone have a question in terms of Council members who are present?,142,,
1074,0.97,7155.181,7160.553,"Okay, my colleagues are not jumping up and down to ask questions initially.",143,,
1075,0.97,7160.553,7172.064,So I think I'll jump in a little bit and ask a few clarifying questions in terms of some of the things that we covered over the course of the discussion.,143,,
1076,0.97,7172.064,7181.908,Can we talk a little bit about assuming the program were to go away in June.,143,,
1077,0.97,7181.908,7186.212,What the impact of your wind down would be in terms of people currently on your case load.,143,,
1078,0.97,7186.212,7194.754,And kind of the exit planning that would be required in that kind of a circumstance.,143,,
1079,0.97,7194.754,7195.154,I can start.,144,,
1080,0.97,7195.154,7203.229,We are of course working on that as a contingency plan because it would be irresponsible not to.,144,,
1081,0.97,7203.229,7210.803,"As some of our partners in public policy positions have pointed out, whether the program continues or not.",144,,
1082,0.97,7210.803,7214.44,We should the way forward is the same.,144,,
1083,0.97,7214.44,7219.545,We should try to find permanent housing placement for everybody that we're working with right now.,144,,
1084,0.97,7219.545,7224.951,Because if the program does continue that will make sure that we have additional space to begin to place more people.,144,,
1085,0.97,7224.951,7228.821,"So it is still the right, it's the right thing to do either way.",144,,
1086,0.97,7228.821,7240.833,About a third of our folks have been identified for emergency housing vouchers through the Renallal homelessness authority.,144,,
1087,0.97,7240.833,7256.248,We really want to acknowledge a great Coplanning partnership with Rhs around both of those vouchers and also what needs to happen for exit planning for our current participants.,144,,
1088,0.97,7256.248,7262.622,We're meeting on Friday to do some scenario planning.,144,,
1089,0.97,7262.622,7268.094,But so those vouchers come with challenges for our population in finding units that will accept them.,144,,
1090,0.97,7268.094,7273.799,We have an incredible team working to resolve those.,144,,
1091,0.97,7273.799,7284.076,But that still leaves 2/3 of our folks who will need to find housing strategies through coordinated entry which has historically not Prioritized this population.,144,,
1092,0.97,7284.076,7287.246,I know half of us could go on for hours about that but I will not.,144,,
1093,0.97,7287.246,7296.689,And just know without a different approach to coordinated entry this population will not find itself way into permanent housing through that Channel.,144,,
1094,0.97,7296.689,7302.995,Rhs has put that topic on the table and we really appreciate that.,144,,
1095,0.97,7302.995,7307.867,That's a structural system change that's overdue.,144,,
1096,0.97,7307.867,7317.476,"And then, sort of, other strategies to find housing outcomes for people are going to be more ad hoc.",144,,
1097,0.97,7317.476,7321.58,"Quite a for more people have, about a couple dozen people.",144,,
1098,0.97,7321.58,7337.697,Maybe three dozen people have found housing by becoming employed and supporting themselves in this very difficult to find housing in this region.,144,,
1099,0.97,7337.697,7340.733,And some of them have done that.,144,,
1100,0.97,7340.733,7359.251,"We have turned all power to that project and if the project, if just care does sustain that means that, we'll have a lot of open capacity to take on more folks.",144,,
1101,0.97,7359.251,7360.286,Anybody want to add anything?,144,,
1102,0.97,7360.286,7365.925,So Lisa just as a follow up.,145,,
1103,0.97,7365.925,7382.141,If instead there was a general Fundesque support like so instead of one time Federal dollars like an ongoing support of General fund that can be more broadly used and more effectively used.,145,,
1104,0.97,7382.141,7393.185,Can you talk a little bit about how that might Problematically impact the effectiveness of just care moving forward in terms of your ability to do this work.,145,,
1105,0.97,7393.185,7400.259,And what we might expect to see potentially from a program that was supported in that way.,145,,
1106,0.97,7400.259,7413.706,"Yes, I want to just, the partner I forgot to acknowledge about the exit planning and contingency planning is Kingcounty.",146,,
1107,0.97,7413.706,7431.023,The health and recovery division and Dchs who are looking at mobilizing their housing division with people who would potentially match up with housing and health.,146,,
1108,0.97,7431.023,7434.393,In terms of problematic impact and stabilization of funding.,146,,
1109,0.97,7434.393,7449.308,I can just not say enough about it's astonishing that the team has been able to have the impact that it has given the adverse conditions that it has been working in both having to relocate the site of the sheltering facilities multiple times.,146,,
1110,0.97,7449.308,7456.849,As well as trying to recruit and retain staff when we have no idea whether or not the program is going to continue.,146,,
1111,0.97,7456.849,7469.562,"I think everybody watching knows that, work force challenges in every sector and those are really complicated when you can't tell people what their job will look like in three months.",146,,
1112,0.97,7469.562,7474.834,"And, so There'Sno doubt that it will stabilize recruitment and staff retention.",146,,
1113,0.97,7474.834,7484.143,And it will allow us to be Moremethodical of sort of time line and sequencing.,146,,
1114,0.97,7484.143,7503.796,"Right now there's a number of neighborhood partners who have identified completely appropriate you know sites and groups of people, other social service providers who have identified folks that we really should work with and being able to provide an answer about what folks can expect rather than we would love to, we don't know if we can.",146,,
1115,0.97,7503.796,7508.968,We don't know when we can.,146,,
1116,0.97,7508.968,7513.172,We'll certainly build legitimacy and confidence.,146,,
1117,0.97,7513.172,7538.697,"And at some point, we will you know, have a better idea about how many people in the area of the downtown and adjacent neighborhoods are really you know best matched to just care while other approaches come Online led by Dhs.",146,,
1118,0.97,7538.697,7548.607,Figuring out the division of labor there and who are the folks who we are the right match to is something that we look forward to doing.,146,,
1119,0.97,7548.607,7567.726,"There are people when just care has been the only option, there's no question that we've taken a few people that don't need the level of service we provide.",146,,
1120,0.97,7567.726,7571.897,So giving that level of service will be paramount.,146,,
1121,0.97,7571.897,7578.237,I definitely look forward to that kind of a world in the future.,147,,
1122,0.97,7578.237,7583.175,That's probably just the most honest way I can say it.,147,,
1123,0.97,7583.175,7586.745,"Council member Herbold, did you have a question.",147,,
1124,0.97,7586.745,7586.979,Yes.,148,,
1125,0.97,7586.979,7594.753,"Lewis, I just want to turn to the central staff memo and the statement in this memo.",148,,
1126,0.97,7594.753,7596.422,Given the budget challenges.,148,,
1127,0.97,7596.422,7598.324,The city is anticipating in 2023.,148,,
1128,0.97,7598.324,7609.001,Due to the city's general fund expenditures outpacing the general fund revenue.,148,,
1129,0.97,7609.001,7616.742,Increasing fund level expenditures to cover service and capital cost will exacerbate the problem.,148,,
1130,0.97,7616.742,7620.212,Unless a dedicated source of funds is identified.,148,,
1131,0.97,7620.212,7640.032,"So what I am seeing here is that we're looking at identifying a ongoing, Nongeneral fund source fund for you know up to $10 million a year.",148,,
1132,0.97,7640.032,7662.855,I just think it's really important that we think about how we are,148,,
1133,0.97,7801.994,7827.819,Designed to get our general fund back on track and rebuild the coffers of the city in a way that reduces having a budgeting process of austerity due to Covid era decline and some of the declining impacts that we've seen regarding chronicle homelessness and crime that have exacerbating that.,149,,
1134,0.97,7827.819,7836.361,"That has been a pivot too for the panel and maybe this is for you again Lisa, but feel free to delegate to somebody else who is on the panel.",149,,
1135,0.97,7836.361,7843.468,"And you know, I want to be respectful of people's time.",149,,
1136,0.97,7843.468,7854.746,"So I, I believe if we may indulge just ten more minutes if people are okay with that.",149,,
1137,0.97,7854.746,7864.957,The way just care came about has been this evolution of partnerships kind of fusing together in order to tackle common issues as a United front.,149,,
1138,0.97,7864.957,7869.528,And I feel there are some other neighborhoods in the city where we have seen organizing.,149,,
1139,0.97,7869.528,7878.036,I know my colleague Council member Morales has Tounfortunately leave the meeting to go to another meeting.,149,,
1140,0.97,7878.036,7889.514,But has done great organizing in Mount Baker who has posed great partners for a just care expansion program.,149,,
1141,0.97,7889.514,7906.131,I know the Bia who has tons of relationships through the University itself would be another place for those type Ofpartnerships.,149,,
1142,0.97,7906.131,7907.466,Obviously we're not talking about that today.,149,,
1143,0.97,7907.466,7909.534,We're talking about the survival of this program.,149,,
1144,0.97,7909.534,7914.006,But I wanted to plant a flag and get your response going forward.,149,,
1145,0.97,7914.006,7931.723,Is there a possibility to explore ways that we can look to continue to expand and Replicate the role this program is serving in other neighborhoods that have similar partners and similar institutions.,149,,
1146,0.97,7931.723,7938.93,That could essentially take advantage of sheltering programs resource the way just cares.,149,,
1147,0.97,7938.93,7947.806,Our goal in starting down this road was to demonstrate that this can work.,150,,
1148,0.97,7947.806,7950.108,"And having experienced that, you know that model.",150,,
1149,0.97,7950.108,7956.815,That lesson is available for expansion and Replications.,150,,
1150,0.97,7956.815,7964.589,"I will say, to your earlier question about stable funding you know what would be the operational impact.",150,,
1151,0.97,7964.589,7979.805,If there is a plan for people that we engage and support for six to nine months to move on to appropriate housing.,150,,
1152,0.97,7979.805,7991.149,And almost everybody coming in the door would have been an appropriate candidate for housing.,150,,
1153,0.97,7991.149,7994.619,But after nine months that's not always the case.,150,,
1154,0.97,7994.619,8004.296,And people have gone on to their own direction.,150,,
1155,0.97,8004.296,8008.3,We can use these same rooms over and over again.,150,,
1156,0.97,8008.3,8013.438,So 150 rooms can support hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people over a several year period.,150,,
1157,0.97,8013.438,8021.713,"And that begins to be a real you know, to have a real impact on the city wide population.",150,,
1158,0.97,8021.713,8029.988,That fits the suite of services that we're providing here.,150,,
1159,0.97,8029.988,8039.965,"So I think ultimately yes, the population that we could work with, appropriately is larger than the number of people we have served so far.",150,,
1160,0.97,8039.965,8045.437,But it's not infinite.,150,,
1161,0.97,8045.437,8050.675,So yes over a several year period I think it can have a city wide impact.,150,,
1162,0.97,8050.675,8069.428,I would hope if we put something together in the spring to expand the program we might put in some kind of state of legislative intend or something to that extent to you know monitor opportunities to look toward the expansion of Thisprogram.,151,,
1163,0.97,8069.428,8074.9,To go to other notes in the city and provide this essential service.,151,,
1164,0.97,8074.9,8084.876,I have one more question and then I'll give it to Council member Mosqueda mostly to close out because I don't think I will have any other questions at that point.,151,,
1165,0.97,8084.876,8087.646,"This is for director Kim, who I know is here.",151,,
1166,0.97,8087.646,8092.617,Who's been very patient thank you for spending your afternoon with us director Kim.,151,,
1167,0.97,8092.617,8096.621,Because I do think one thing we need to address too.,151,,
1168,0.97,8096.621,8100.258,"In terms of the sequencing, obviously the funding question.",151,,
1169,0.97,8100.258,8102.26,That Council member Herbold spoke to.,151,,
1170,0.97,8102.26,8104.93,And that we've all spoken to.,151,,
1171,0.97,8104.93,8107.599,This sort of a first circle that needs to be squared.,151,,
1172,0.97,8107.599,8116.007,We're going to need to have a conversation if we do want to continue this program out where this program would live.,151,,
1173,0.97,8116.007,8125.15,The current contract as we understand it while we're supporting this program with money transmitted through Hsd to the county.,151,,
1174,0.97,8125.15,8126.284,King County holds the contract.,151,,
1175,0.97,8126.284,8137.496,It is something we were not quite able to migrate to the regional homelessness authority.,151,,
1176,0.97,8137.496,8141.199,With my recollection wanting to find a way to send it.,151,,
1177,0.97,8141.199,8144.703,It wasn't quite Practica since the assistance beyond June was not clear.,151,,
1178,0.97,8144.703,8170.228,I guess that my question for director Kim in her professional opinion would be the person who would either be working with Rha if we move this to Rha or putting this into one of the Dhs groups initially if there's Anythoughts about where we Úwould want this program to be if we were to fund it.,151,,
1179,0.97,8170.228,8173.698,I realize it's the cart before the horse because we need to find the money first.,151,,
1180,0.97,8173.698,8184.476,"But if we do, it would just be good to Cue up the conversation for sometime in April where we could have that conversation as well.",151,,
1181,0.97,8184.476,8187.212,Obviously with County and Hra officials in the room to hash it out.,151,,
1182,0.97,8187.212,8193.351,But just some of your initial reactions director Kim as the professional in this area.,151,,
1183,0.97,8193.351,8193.652,Thanks.,152,,
1184,0.97,8193.652,8195.921,It's my pleasure to be here with such a great panel.,152,,
1185,0.97,8195.921,8198.323,Thank you for letting me sit in.,152,,
1186,0.97,8198.323,8202.46,I think you're right.,152,,
1187,0.97,8202.46,8205.23,It just warrants further conversation.,152,,
1188,0.97,8205.23,8211.436,"I was brought in to, this very recently and I haven't had an opportunity to talk with the executive or with Rha.",152,,
1189,0.97,8211.436,8217.709,But I think you're on to something that more conversation needs to be had.,152,,
1190,0.97,8217.709,8219.711,I'm a mission driven person.,152,,
1191,0.97,8219.711,8225.584,"And so, and also I look to the Rha for the right leadership around our region strategy.",152,,
1192,0.97,8225.584,8230.555,I know that that's why we're supporting them to succeed.,152,,
1193,0.97,8230.555,8231.456,But you're right.,152,,
1194,0.97,8231.456,8231.79,So I'm there.,152,,
1195,0.97,8231.79,8238.096,When we're ready to have those conversations I'm happy to have those.,152,,
1196,0.97,8238.096,8245.637,Okay we'll try to Cue that up in our work plan probably for Maybe an April committee meeting.,153,,
1197,0.97,8245.637,8258.583,Presuming we have some good conversations about ways to maybe Bake this into the Mayor'Sprogram.,153,,
1198,0.97,8258.583,8259.484,But tough financial conversations.,153,,
1199,0.97,8259.484,8263.622,Good Segway to our budget chair Council member Mosqueda who had a question.,153,,
1200,0.97,8263.622,8264.155,Thanks so much.,154,,
1201,0.97,8264.155,8272.33,I really want to thank the panel for this presentation today.,154,,
1202,0.97,8272.33,8291.516,And remind the viewing public and I know folks in this panel are aware that the county has tried to make sure not to treat homelessness as a business as usual on the budget.,154,,
1203,0.97,8291.516,8300.592,"The last piece, at the end of 2022 we started by building back the just care model.",154,,
1204,0.97,8300.592,8309.434,I want to thank Council member Herbold and Lewis for their support of this program and continuing to bring it up.,154,,
1205,0.97,8309.434,8313.872,We built it back for the next two year period.,154,,
1206,0.97,8313.872,8334.959,The take away message that we're getting is we want to make sure we're not in that situation where we're having to rebuild just cares every six months when it's truly a proven program that helps create stability and as all of the panelists from community to business leaders have noted is effective at making sure that folks get into housing.,154,,
1207,0.97,8334.959,8338.663,So appreciate the work you've done.,154,,
1208,0.97,8338.663,8348.073,"And again, I think that, to clarify for anybody who is out there is wondering how Council's approach is.",154,,
1209,0.97,8348.073,8352.61,Council rebuilt this program in the 2022 budget.,154,,
1210,0.97,8352.61,8362.754,And 115 million from Council's general fund is going into the regional homelessness authority which is 70% of the Homelessnessbudget.,154,,
1211,0.97,8362.754,8373.031,"When 68% of the funding is coming from the city and the House chair, the vice Chase of finance has noted.",154,,
1212,0.97,8373.031,8375.867,We're all gearing up going into investment needs.,154,,
1213,0.97,8375.867,8384.008,There's going to be a budget crunch but this is something that's Predated me as budget chair.,154,,
1214,0.97,8384.008,8388.113,This is something that Predated Covid.,154,,
1215,0.97,8388.113,8390.081,Something that Predated the last several chairs as well.,154,,
1216,0.97,8390.081,8424.949,"We've had a population that's grown by 21% in the last ten years and we haven't seen absent the jump start program on progressive payroll tax, we haven't seen corresponding investment or changes that's something that we need to think of here, I continue to flag the needs and homelessness services including just care so we can stabilize community programs and stable for the human service providers.",154,,
1217,0.97,8424.949,8441.666,"I appreciate all of you in fighting for the cost of Livingincrease, the Awi application that has not been approved for five years who Council fought to get that and you have been very hopeful.",154,,
1218,0.97,8441.666,8453.878,I think those two things go hand and glove stability for fighting for services and stabilizing the providers.,154,,
1219,0.97,8453.878,8456.981,I have two questions.,154,,
1220,0.97,8456.981,8460.485,One is related to the initiative supportive.,154,,
1221,0.97,8460.485,8467.292,The team at the regional homelessness authority when asking about support for the just cares program.,154,,
1222,0.97,8467.292,8470.061,Pretty immediately heard back that there is space for that conversation.,154,,
1223,0.97,8470.061,8475.467,Want to hear more about the cost of how to get us through at least 2022.,154,,
1224,0.97,8475.467,8488.012,And an openness to having a dialogue there Especiallyperhaps given $10 million through philanthropic opportunity there.,154,,
1225,0.97,8488.012,8492.65,That's some where being just cares would be ideal.,154,,
1226,0.97,8492.65,8502.026,Wondering how those conversations have gone and look forward to hear more about opportunity with the homelessness authority through 2022.,154,,
1227,0.97,8502.026,8528.052,"The second question I have is a lot of conversations were had throughout last year a pledge from our couldn't Mayor to create 2,000 new units for services, excuse me homeless shelter and I think that's very helpful.",154,,
1228,0.97,8528.052,8537.195,Building more affordable housing and permanent supportive housing so that there's an exit from shelters which are currently at capacity.,154,,
1229,0.97,8537.195,8541.833,So we know we need to build additional house.,154,,
1230,0.97,8541.833,8544.602,Can you tell us where you all have been plugged in.,154,,
1231,0.97,8544.602,8580.905,"Excuse me 2,000 new units can you tell me where you've been Pluged in on that how that conversation is going Ideally we would be at 203 new units, giving that it's March 1ST, with Dhs taking contracts over, lots of implementation going on right now, lots of funds being discussed at the state level, how do you see implementation coming together and any support we can bring ..",154,,
1232,0.97,8580.905,8587.345,First I want to say we wouldn't be here without the leadership of this Council and making sure this impact is possible.,155,,
1233,0.97,8587.345,8590.782,So this would be a historical reflection at this point.,155,,
1234,0.97,8590.782,8594.285,So thank you so much for that leadership.,155,,
1235,0.97,8594.285,8608.066,I think the thing about the 2000 unit contract is it always to my understanding has been a blended concept.,155,,
1236,0.97,8608.066,8619.744,"Incorporating has been new not, he notes that there are already plans in the pine line to have the impact that I know everybody wants to see.",155,,
1237,0.97,8619.744,8631.723,"And so some of it has to be, what has been referred to as we use the term temporary lodging or bridge housing.",155,,
1238,0.97,8631.723,8640.999,And that is the resource that allows for a very nimble movement and then as we described in the presentation.,155,,
1239,0.97,8640.999,8646.471,Sort of a deeper dive into what is happening in 70s life.,155,,
1240,0.97,8646.471,8654.045,So that a good housing placement can be designed and identified.,155,,
1241,0.97,8654.045,8664.122,"And so, bridge housing really has, temporary lodging has a really valuable place in Thatportfolio of the 2,000 units that hopefully will come Online.",155,,
1242,0.97,8664.122,8668.526,"And we are, sorry my dog feeling strongly about this too.",155,,
1243,0.97,8668.526,8674.632,We're some where between 150 and we currently have 240 rooms.,155,,
1244,0.97,8674.632,8678.503,"So that's a, an important but minor slice of the 2000 unit poll.",155,,
1245,0.97,8678.503,8682.006,So if we can hang on to this.,155,,
1246,0.97,8682.006,8693.051,"And others are augmenting in other ways we can really have the impact of that 2,000 unit pledge is intended to deliver.",155,,
1247,0.97,8693.051,8694.385,But going backward.,155,,
1248,0.97,8694.385,8701.125,"Obviously, we're going to see deteriorating conditions on the street.",155,,
1249,0.97,8701.125,8711.302,"So in terms of Rha, I just can't say enough about the thought partnership that we're starting to see emerge there.",155,,
1250,0.97,8711.302,8727.819,"As I said we're meeting on Friday to talk about support for housing of people working with understanding the impact if those people were not, did not have a solid exit plan.",155,,
1251,0.97,8727.819,8742.366,But that that has not come along with the idea that if the program were to continue it would expand additional capacity to have an immediate impact on the street.,155,,
1252,0.97,8742.366,8742.667,So hopeful.,155,,
1253,0.97,8742.667,8745.436,Thank you so much for that.,156,,
1254,0.97,8745.436,8749.207,I given the late hour I don't have any addition questions I'll ask here.,156,,
1255,0.97,8749.207,8752.543,But I do just want to signal a couple next steps.,156,,
1256,0.97,8752.543,8758.116,I think we still have Jeff and Tracy with us on the line here from Council central staff.,156,,
1257,0.97,8758.116,8759.784,So in terms of the next step.,156,,
1258,0.97,8759.784,8768.392,"You know I do want to have another hearing, and I guess actually for Jacob.",156,,
1259,0.97,8768.392,8768.926,Committee court as well.,156,,
1260,0.97,8768.926,8778.069,I do want to have another hearing on this in terms of moving forward Ideally first hearing in April if that can be accommodated by stake holders.,156,,
1261,0.97,8778.069,8780.905,But we can work on that.,156,,
1262,0.97,8780.905,8784.308,"And in the interim, I know the Mayor's office is probably listening too.",156,,
1263,0.97,8784.308,8798.289,Let's try to have a meeting Mayor's office about how we might incorporate planning around just care into our broader public safety planning and homelessness outreach planning.,156,,
1264,0.97,8798.289,8800.625,To the interaction with director Kim earlier.,156,,
1265,0.97,8800.625,8813.404,"I firmly believe if this continues, you know that it should pending their approval and interest that it should continue in the regional homelessness authority.",156,,
1266,0.97,8813.404,8829.253,I'm generally supportive of making sure we're integrating most of our homeless access.,156,,
1267,0.97,8829.253,8842.266,If this were to continue I just want to flag I would like to have a discussion on what that might look like just to make sure that we are integrating all of our resources in one place.,156,,
1268,0.97,8842.266,8846.003,Drhs I think would be the most appropriate in the current landscape.,156,,
1269,0.97,8846.003,8851.943,I would like to have that conversation with them if they're interested sometime in March as well.,156,,
1270,0.97,8851.943,8862.486,And maybe we can have another hearing in April where we discuss our progress on how to square a lot of these circles.,156,,
1271,0.97,8862.486,8865.122,So that is a good place to leave it for now.,156,,
1272,0.97,8865.122,8871.062,One thing I do just want to say to everyone here who is doing this work on the field every day.,156,,
1273,0.97,8871.062,8882.34,"That by far, this work with you and the work with just care is the best thing I've done in my two years and two or so months on the city council.",156,,
1274,0.97,8882.34,8885.71,It is by far the best thing I've done.,156,,
1275,0.97,8885.71,8909.4,It has been a great privilege to watch you guys work and do this and evolve and make a positive impact on an issue that you think is retractable and prove that there's ways that we can bring compassion and humanitarian spirit to resolving these issues in a humanely positive way.,156,,
1276,0.97,8909.4,8911.903,So thank you so much for everything you're doing.,156,,
1277,0.97,8911.903,8916.474,And let's see if we can continue to keep working together.,156,,
1278,0.97,8916.474,8916.774,Thank you.,156,,
1279,0.97,8916.774,8918.276,"And with that, this meeting is adjourned.",156,,
