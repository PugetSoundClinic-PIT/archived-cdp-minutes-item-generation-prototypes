142,0.97,650.783,659.725,"It was a no Brainer to support the Baristas who help them start their mornings and their fight for Union representation, fair pay, and Covid protections.",26,,
143,0.97,659.725,677.677,"To have the city council in the city where Starbucks was founded condemn hundreds of thousands of dollars Starbucks is spending from their immense pandemic profits to keep workers down from having a fair say, that would be a huge deal to not just the workers at the shops organizing in this city but around the country.",26,,

145,0.97,678.577,680.212,It will have a material impact.,26,,
146,0.97,680.212,684.45,And I think that's especially important in the midst of this Covid surge.,26,,
147,0.97,684.45,691.891,Where we've seen that it took a Union for Starbucks workers to win state isolation when exposed.,26,,
148,0.97,691.891,695.361,That's the only way we'll help keep people --,26,,

160,0.97,770.336,782.782,"From the resolution, where as Baristas, working at the Starbucks located in Seattle's Capitol Hill reported they and their coworkers are attempting to organize into the Union.",28,,
161,0.97,782.782,792.825,"They have requested support from officials to demand Starbucks, let the workers decide without interference, threat or Intimidations, end of quote.",28,,

169,0.97,827.826,839.271,Some of the worst things include working at a cafe where the owner refused to deal with a Roach infestation for months after the health Department was involved.,30,,
170,0.97,839.271,850.616,"I worked as a line Cook but the number one thing that stands out to me in eight years of food service, I had a Coworker speculate the ceiling might cave in due to water damage.",30,,
171,0.97,850.616,857.223,And told me he hoped it would happen so he would get injured to get workers COMP.,30,,
172,0.97,857.223,860.893,This is why all cafes and restaurants need a Union.,30,,
173,0.97,860.893,862.061,Starbucks workers are leading the way.,30,,
174,0.97,862.061,866.732,And you have a responsibility to support this resolution.,30,,

180,0.97,883.983,893.492,"Employees have begun the process of Unionizing Starbucks workers deserve the right to decide whether to form without interference, threats or intimidation.",32,,
181,0.97,893.492,900.833,But corporate executives and Ceos like Howard Shultz don't want workers to have that basic right.,32,,
182,0.97,900.833,906.338,They've sent out of town managers to stores to intimidate workers.,32,,
183,0.97,906.338,912.444,Held captive audience meetings and are now attempting to over turn the decision to allow workers to Unionize.,32,,
184,0.97,912.444,923.055,So I'm calling on city Council to vote yes on Councilmember Sawant's resolution calling on Starbucks to top its Union Busting.,32,,
