207,0.97,1217.282,1218.183,If folks can help me with that.,53,,
208,0.97,1218.183,1229.595,I'm not seeing Elsa in the Attendee list.,54,,
209,0.97,1229.595,1238.67,I know we have been having computer difficulties this week.,55,,
210,0.97,1238.67,1241.74,We will just take a minute to see if she can log on or be promoted.,55,,
211,0.97,1241.74,1255.12,I can get going and as she Logsdon--several of you know also from the Department of neighborhoods who was our senses advisor over the last couple of years.,56,,
212,0.97,1255.12,1267.032,"And in 2021, acting as the pace coordinator and we will hear more about that today in the presentation.",56,,
213,0.97,1267.032,1268.634,So I will go on.,56,,
214,0.97,1268.634,1278.41,Thank you for the opportunity to address this Committee and tell you a little bit about the Department of neighborhoods in the 2020 year and the accomplishments.,56,,
215,0.97,1278.41,1284.016,"As a reminder, the vision of the Department of neighborhoods is to strengthen Seattle by actively engaging all communities.",56,,
216,0.97,1284.016,1287.319,And we do that by centering them to Northstar goals.,56,,
217,0.97,1287.319,1296.461,The first is to put race in equity at the center of all of our Decisios and actions and to invest in the power of communities to forge their own solutions.,56,,
218,0.97,1296.461,1298.864,We are committed to the Northstar goals through a four core strategies.,56,,
219,0.97,1298.864,1300.232,We will highlight some examples of those today.,56,,
220,0.97,1300.232,1317.182,One is by trusting advocates and the second is by looking at people centered Storytelling and investing in civic education programs and investing in equitable engagement and other programmatic investments.,56,,
221,0.97,1317.182,1321.086,"And so today, as I mentioned, we are going to talk a little bit about the 2020 accomplishments.",56,,
222,0.97,1321.086,1326.591,We are going to be focusing on the pace program.,56,,
223,0.97,1326.591,1331.897,Some of you are very familiar with the pace program and have been guests at that program as well.,56,,
224,0.97,1331.897,1337.602,This dance for the people's Academy for community Ngagement.,56,,
225,0.97,1337.602,1339.438,It is an engagement approach with that apartment of neighborhoods.,56,,
226,0.97,1339.438,1351.917,"The reason we are highlighting that today is because for 2020 and into 21, there was some reorientation we need to do given some staffing changes.",56,,
227,0.97,1351.917,1353.685,"And in that, we will hear from some partners.",56,,
228,0.97,1353.685,1362.994,We will be joined by my a from the league to talk about the partnership we developed with them around pace.,56,,
229,0.97,1362.994,1369.234,So next slide.,56,,
230,0.97,1369.234,1382.581,"In 2020, as many departments needed to do and as the city did, we needed to really pause a lot of the work to shift dramatically to helping the most vulnerable residents through responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.",57,,
231,0.97,1382.581,1404.035,That was all from the work we did through the community liaison program to literally stopping the granting cycles and focusing and refocusing resources toward things like food access and community capacity support through the neighborhood matching fund.,57,,
232,0.97,1404.035,1404.369,Next slide.,57,,
233,0.97,1404.369,1419.317,"Through all of 2020, we worked in partnership with FAS and other colleagues around Covid-19, first starting with getting out there in the early days.",58,,
234,0.97,1419.317,1419.985,As you remember.,58,,
235,0.97,1419.985,1422.053,There was a lot of misinformation and hesitancy around Covid-19.,58,,
236,0.97,1422.053,1424.99,There still is.,58,,
237,0.97,1424.99,1428.093,But lack of education and education but with the virus was and what it meant for communities.,58,,
238,0.97,1428.093,1454.152,"So that apartment of neighborhoods mobilized to organize Covid-19 community outreach Webinars and where we were in the Clearinghouse for city agencies about what needed to happen in terms of things like utility shut off and what was happening with utility shut off for businesses and for residents, to things like, how to access food programs or mental health resources.",58,,
239,0.97,1454.152,1462.194,"We provided, in language, Digital outreach through the community liaisons as information was shifting very quickly.",58,,
240,0.97,1462.194,1475.006,Often what we needed to do was shoot language videos that we would post on Facebook and social media pages opting to do that instead of the long translation because information was coming quickly.,58,,
241,0.97,1475.006,1497.429,"Through 2020, we then transition the effort into the distribution of face coverings starting with the Mayor's office, community partners, King County public health to distribute Facemasks and other face coverings to organizations that were needing them in the community.",58,,
242,0.97,1497.429,1503.869,"And even now, as we transition back to Vaccinations, we are still doing this and disturbing face coverings throughout Seattle.",58,,
243,0.97,1503.869,1516.281,"And Lastly, really working with Seattle fire Department in the Seattle parks Department around Covid-19 testing sites including two testing sites.",58,,
244,0.97,1516.281,1517.849,One at Rainier Beach and one at Seattle.,58,,
245,0.97,1517.849,1525.39,Really to target those communities and to lift up Covid-19 testing.,58,,
246,0.97,1525.39,1533.498,"Other activities that we did, or other efforts we did in 2020 was working with an interdepartmental team for more than 15 hygiene stations.",58,,
247,0.97,1533.498,1536.101,Several of you participated in some of those conversations.,58,,
248,0.97,1536.101,1546.211,The goal here was to provide hygiene services across our communities and House neighbors.,58,,
249,0.97,1546.211,1567.432,We also continue the partnership with the human service Department in King County around community engagement to direct folks to shelter and make resources available to those who have questions around what those shelters could provide and working with King County around the standing up of a shelter for Covid-19.,58,,
250,0.97,1567.432,1574.839,"And then, Lastly, one of the highlights is, we partnered with city fruit to host eight Pop-Up events.",58,,
251,0.97,1574.839,1584.349,"As you know, a lot of the P patches, a lot of the users rely on the primary source of food.",58,,
252,0.97,1584.349,1596.528,And so we served over 750 families and over 2000 pounds of vegetables from the P patch gardens.,58,,
253,0.97,1596.528,1602.467,"Director, I want to take a moment to recognize the amount of important work that you did last year.",59,,
254,0.97,1602.467,1610.976,It is really the connecting fabric between the services and the people who may not speak English as a primary language.,59,,
255,0.97,1610.976,1619.751,It is so critical for people to feel safe and comfortable in.,59,,
256,0.97,1619.751,1626.524,"And for that to happen, they have to understand what is going on.",59,,
257,0.97,1626.524,1640.505,"And while the city was moving forward quickly and rapidly on so many different issues to address the Covid-19 emergency, your Department was--maybe not in the spotlight in doing the critical work for our community.",59,,
258,0.97,1640.505,1641.906,So I want to highlight and thank you for the.,59,,
259,0.97,1641.906,1642.607,Thank you Councilmember.,60,,
260,0.97,1642.607,1656.921,We feel that engaging in language is a conversation with communities so they understand the full context of the work happening and what is required.,60,,
261,0.97,1656.921,1664.095,"One thing I forgot to mention is right now if you go to lumen field, and if you haven't, I encourage you to take a look at the great work happening there.",60,,
262,0.97,1664.095,1668.5,We are working with them among other partners to do in language videos.,60,,
263,0.97,1668.5,1679.344,"And so far we have done, in Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Korean, Somali.",60,,
264,0.97,1679.344,1695.693,And the purpose of the videos is essentially what to expect when you are getting Vaccinated so that we are trying to dispel the myths for any sort of hesitancy that might exist and encourage folks to go down to lumen field and other sites to get Vaccinated.,60,,
265,0.97,1695.693,1705.336,"I wanted to move forward to ""Seattle together ."" it is a partnership with arts in the Department of neighborhoods.",61,,
266,0.97,1705.336,1712.677,Also with our other colleagues in Sdot in libraries and Spu across the majority of the city.,61,,
267,0.97,1712.677,1721.386,Really focused on a citywide initiative to support and uplift don't celebrate the enormous goodwill that is happening in the community.,61,,
268,0.97,1721.386,1734.599,"It sprung up during the early days of the pandemic when we were really asking, how can we foster relationships and a feeling of belonging, connection and joy in Seattle?",61,,
269,0.97,1734.599,1742.907,It really became a space where we were elevating stories of goodwill and mutual aid and were happening in community and bringing them to the masses and really working in partnership.,61,,
270,0.97,1742.907,1751.816,"Some of the examples you see here, we did--we started with our first event which is, make a joyful noise.",61,,
271,0.97,1751.816,1753.118,Thousands of Seattleites would gather at 8:00 P.M.,61,,
272,0.97,1753.118,1760.825,Nightly for a couple of weeks and cheer on essential workers.,61,,
273,0.97,1760.825,1764.996,Public art in your front yard as you can see in this example here.,61,,
274,0.97,1764.996,1772.537,And we were really working to develop new ways for the city to meet the needs of local communities during the pandemic.,61,,
275,0.97,1772.537,1777.142,I encourage you--we don't have a lot of time to go into this.,61,,
276,0.97,1777.142,1785.45,I encourage you to visit the Website which is Seattletogether.Org to understand more about the work and we are happy to come back with our partners in arts and the library to talk more about the committee.,61,,
277,0.97,1785.45,1797.662,Some of the highlights is that we contracted with over 118 local artists and community groups to really invest in our local creative economy and provide programming.,61,,
278,0.97,1797.662,1804.235,"As you know, some of the creative's were some of the first workers that were affected by the pandemic.",61,,
279,0.97,1804.235,1808.072,So it was important for us to center some of our solutions and giving economic relief.,61,,
280,0.97,1808.072,1830.061,"To the end, we distributed with the office of planning and community development, over 150,000 mini grants to honor the work organizations are doing and providing food access and health services and support to the communities most impacted by Covid-19.",61,,
281,0.97,1830.061,1831.296,That is great work.,62,,
282,0.97,1831.296,1832.964,I want to highlight that also has joined us.,62,,
283,0.97,1832.964,1836.801,And we know that she has done amazing work.,62,,
284,0.97,1836.801,1841.639,Thank you.,63,,
285,0.97,1841.639,1853.218,The last thing I want to talk about before we go over to Elsa is actually our Úconversation around interdepartmental support .'s support issue for us.,64,,
286,0.97,1853.218,1869.934,"As you know, one of the things the Department of neighborhoods over the last two or three years has been focusing on is, how do we work with our other organizations to really reduce the silo of city services and outreach and engagement so they can be seamless in terms of how we communicate with the community and residents.",64,,
287,0.97,1869.934,1890.788,Some of the examples around interdepartmental support was the work that we did with the office of economic development around business support and small business outreach around the paycheck prevention program and the work that Oed was doing around the small business stabilization fund.,64,,
288,0.97,1890.788,1894.025,"And of interest to you all, it is also the stay healthy streets.",64,,
289,0.97,1894.025,1899.464,We worked with S.D.O.T.,64,,
290,0.97,1899.464,1908.873,To Prioritize outreach strategies and entering community voices specifically in the central district and the central area.,64,,
291,0.97,1908.873,1917.582,"Lastly, in 2020, focused on outreach to TNC drivers.",64,,
292,0.97,1917.582,1925.79,We worked with over 200 in 2019 and in 2020.,64,,
293,0.97,1925.79,1930.795,"Overall, engaged with about 6000 drivers through that effort.",64,,
294,0.97,1930.795,1931.129,Next slide.,64,,
295,0.97,1931.129,1942.173,We continue to do our work and started the work on the West Seattle bridge doing the outreach and community outreach process for the West Seattle bridge outreach.,64,,
296,0.97,1942.173,1949.013,And then working with sound transit through the implantation program throughout the extension.,64,,
297,0.97,1949.013,1957.622,Working with our partners with the office of civil rights.,64,,
298,0.97,1957.622,1958.389,"Finally, working with S.D.O.T.",64,,
299,0.97,1958.389,1972.904,"Again in our historic districts and landmark districts around things like sidewalk Cafcs, street closures, which I NOTE Councilmember Strauss, it is particularly of importance to you.",64,,
300,0.97,1972.904,1974.605,We can come back and do a deeper dive into those.,64,,
301,0.97,1974.605,1988.853,I would say that you are correct that I'm very interested in making many of our Cafc streets on sidewalk Cafcs permanent even after Covid-19 ends.,65,,
302,0.97,1988.853,1995.626,I want to thank you and everyone in your Department for allowing the flexibility within the historic districts over the last year.,65,,
303,0.97,1995.626,1996.861,It is such a long Avenue.,65,,
304,0.97,1996.861,2012.543,We are excited for the apartment of neighborhoods to participate in our design and looking at how we can allow the rules and code to catch up to some of the changes we have seen and how we live our lives in Seattle.,65,,
305,0.97,2012.543,2015.279,Seattle has not necessarily been a Cafc culture.,65,,
306,0.97,2015.279,2018.349,It seems like we may have become a Cafc culture this last year.,65,,
307,0.97,2018.349,2043.574,"I share this because it is important that we keep the historic nature of our historic districts and for instance, on Ballard Avenue, there are now coverings in the streets that might not meet the historic items in the long term and we need to provide just a little bit of flexibility and in a couple of years, for predictability and permanent changes to be made and allow the businesses to catch up.",65,,
308,0.97,2043.574,2053.017,"So that in the long run, we are protecting the historic districts as the board's desire and providing businesses with a little bit of flexibility to catch up.",65,,
309,0.97,2053.017,2053.751,So not a question.,65,,
310,0.97,2053.751,2060.124,Just another round of thanks to your Department for doing great work.,65,,
311,0.97,2060.124,2060.825,Thank you Councilmember.,66,,
312,0.97,2060.825,2069.801,"Now, since we are joined by Elsa, we will talk turned over to her to talk about 2020 and the pace presentation.",66,,
313,0.97,2069.801,2070.168,Take it away.,66,,
314,0.97,2070.168,2075.239,Thank you.,67,,
315,0.97,2075.239,2082.346,And thank you to my teams who put that together.,67,,
316,0.97,2082.346,2084.282,"As you know, we had a tremendous success last year.",67,,
317,0.97,2084.282,2092.19,The outreach was focused on making sure historically Undercounted communities are part of this.,67,,
318,0.97,2092.19,2100.131,And the way in which we engage them was the long term commitment to understanding the long-term since his.,67,,
319,0.97,2100.131,2104.469,And that has a Repercussion of the work we are doing this year as well.,67,,
320,0.97,2104.469,2109.24,"As you know, we led a campaign that resulted in 76.3%.",67,,
321,0.97,2109.24,2118.683,This was one of the largest and highest in the nation and cities of our size.,67,,
322,0.97,2118.683,2120.785,We coordinated a community census task force for a whole two years.,67,,
323,0.97,2120.785,2129.76,"We met almost every month to see, what can we do with engaging folks everywhere we could in Seattle.",67,,
324,0.97,2129.76,2135.366,The other piece that was key was to find funding.,67,,
325,0.97,2135.366,2136.767,Not just funding the city had administered.,67,,
326,0.97,2136.767,2143.174,We also found some funding from the state to do some ethnic and minority media outlets.,67,,
327,0.97,2143.174,2149.981,"And in general, we engaged with more than 59 Community-Based organizations to do outreach work with us.",67,,
328,0.97,2149.981,2160.224,And probably one of the most challenging times ever.,67,,
329,0.97,2160.224,2164.128,Not just because of Covid-19 but because of the past administration made it really hard.,67,,
330,0.97,2164.128,2173.504,So it was definitely (Indiscernible) and worked with many departments.,67,,
331,0.97,2173.504,2174.005,King County.,67,,
332,0.97,2174.005,2178.843,It was a great effort.,67,,
333,0.97,2178.843,2180.845,And the state grew about 7%.,67,,
334,0.97,2180.845,2183.848,That is about all we know.,67,,
335,0.97,2183.848,2196.627,And we will get details about the Census with age block by block with August and September and sharing that information.,67,,
336,0.97,2196.627,2201.332,"The last slide, I do have one question.",68,,
337,0.97,2201.332,2212.91,"And I want to highlight what you just said, which is, with the previous Federal administration, there was a lot of hesitancy among many in the community about engaging with the census.",68,,
338,0.97,2212.91,2218.983,"And your work, Elsa, allowed us to warm that she'll, to allow people to feel comfortable.",68,,
339,0.97,2218.983,2228.593,And I just want to highlight that.,68,,
340,0.97,2228.593,2235.733,"During last year's budget process for this year's budget, counsel maintained funding for the senses outreach position even though the Census itself had concluded.",68,,
341,0.97,2235.733,2240.938,Can you speak to the ongoing work?,68,,
342,0.97,2240.938,2247.511,I will speak a little more because it is connected to the next part it is about.,69,,
343,0.97,2247.511,2248.613,The accountability for community engagement.,69,,
344,0.97,2248.613,2256.187,"One of the reasons why it was successful is because the organizations we connected with, we committed to them to a long-term civic engagement plan.",69,,
345,0.97,2256.187,2276.04,"The only reason why community participated was because they understood that even though we had a horrible administration for four years with this, this meant it was--elected to use the term it was a fight against disability and we wanted to be here and engage with all levels of government.",69,,
346,0.97,2276.04,2294.258,"So the work we are doing, we are doing a program called the people's Academy for community engagement as well as some other s where we are creating--we have the second session called the I love census data.",69,,
347,0.97,2294.258,2300.164,It is a conversation where we are trying to make nay for data available to people.,69,,
348,0.97,2300.164,2317.882,We are working with the office of civil rights--we are trying to make data and show folks that we engage with throughout the process how data is used and ways in which people can access.,69,,
349,0.97,2317.882,2325.389,So I hope that answers your question.,69,,
350,0.97,2325.389,2327.091,It does.,70,,
351,0.97,2327.091,2327.525,Thank you.,70,,
352,0.97,2327.525,2330.995,"I will just add, you can go to the next slide.",71,,
353,0.97,2330.995,2336.6,One of the key feedback we heard from community was that cut off.,71,,
354,0.97,2336.6,2342.807,That engagement that was happening the 2020 census.,71,,
355,0.97,2342.807,2353.551,And what we wanted to do was make sure that we built in that pipeline or that ongoing way of community--engaging communities.,71,,
356,0.97,2353.551,2366.831,"Quickly, some of the things we learned--and the innovations and adaptations we built into the programs, first, you heard about the Pea patch community garden.",71,,
357,0.97,2366.831,2375.706,"One of the things who worked on in 2020 is to shift the programmatic goals, strategies and resources, really intentionally to expanding wrote--the relationships in the communities.",71,,
358,0.97,2375.706,2389.854,"And for the first half of the year, as we were gaining new partners, about 45% of those gardeners were placed from these groups.",71,,
359,0.97,2389.854,2395.76,We anticipate that to continue in 2021 and working with the community organizations with that in mind.,71,,
360,0.97,2395.76,2402.366,"Similarly, we thank you for your work and other counsel.",71,,
361,0.97,2402.366,2405.636,We work on changes to our historic preservation program.,71,,
362,0.97,2405.636,2417.381,We launched an Online certificate of approval process and transition the meetings in the several historic district boards from In-Person events to virtual gatherings.,71,,
363,0.97,2417.381,2449.78,"And through that, we worked on putting forward an administrative review of the process that allowed us to streamline these more minor shifts happening in historic districts and allow either the landmark preservation board to focus on the bigger and more Impactful projects happening in the communities.",71,,
364,0.97,2449.78,2458.122,"As we mentioned, we work with community liaisons to make sure we were Well-Versed in connecting with communities via Digital social media Voiceovers.",72,,
365,0.97,2458.122,2476.507,"Despite some cuts we needed to take to the neighborhood matching fund, we were able to work 23 community projects for a total of just over $700,000 as well as leadership advisors and managers, stand up and expand the healthy food programs in several food opportunity funds.",72,,
366,0.97,2476.507,2486.35,"And finally the Pea patch garden donated over 40,000 pounds of fresh fruit produce to local food banks.",72,,
367,0.97,2486.35,2493.824,So some highlights there.,72,,
368,0.97,2493.824,2499.33,And some momentum we gained in 2020 and into 2021.,72,,
369,0.97,2499.33,2499.93,Next slide.,72,,
370,0.97,2499.93,2508.205,"So I want to turn it back over to Elsa and for the rest of the presentation, talk about pace, the people's Academy for community engagement.",73,,
371,0.97,2508.205,2516.547,"Thank you and I want to acknowledge that we are joined by our community members here, partners from the urban League.",74,,
372,0.97,2516.547,2524.121,And they will be sharing slides in a second.,74,,
373,0.97,2524.121,2530.594,This is the presentation I have for you about our people's Academy for community engagement.,75,,
374,0.97,2530.594,2532.83,A program that has been going on and has had many different versions.,75,,
375,0.97,2532.83,2552.616,"This year, due to everything going on, we decided all the engagement and everything we engage with the Stakeholder basis, how can we continue for what Andrcs Mantilla said which is the commitment to not just call them when we need them.",75,,
376,0.97,2552.616,2553.784,But to continue this engagement.,75,,
377,0.97,2553.784,2563.027,What we learned is the community wants to learn the best ways to engage with government.,75,,
378,0.97,2563.027,2571.669,"As you know, when people from the city go up in the community, it doesn't matter if you are from the Council or one Department or the other.",75,,
379,0.97,2571.669,2603.434,"The goal was, how can we continue the engagement and different ways . What we did is we created the program for standard community engagement engagement of community members with networking and Decision- makers.",75,,
380,0.97,2603.434,2605.135,(Indiscernible) and offering Participatory learning in the current initiative.,75,,
381,0.97,2605.135,2609.273,That is what it has been.,75,,
382,0.97,2609.273,2610.674,New this year is it has been shorter.,75,,
383,0.97,2610.674,2627.491,The most important part is we partner with the funds and the urban League and the coalition in South park.,75,,
384,0.97,2627.491,2628.258,And Georgetown and South park.,75,,
385,0.97,2628.258,2635.899,And we are finalizing with the API community.,75,,
386,0.97,2635.899,2646.51,Our cohorts are based on issues specifically wanting to learn about engaging them.,75,,
387,0.97,2646.51,2648.278,And we include them in Stipends.,75,,
388,0.97,2648.278,2655.619,"In other years, people would come and offer food and Childcare.",75,,
389,0.97,2655.619,2656.62,And we provide Stipends.,75,,
390,0.97,2656.62,2660.724,And we Cocreated the curriculum and the recruitment plan for this.,75,,
391,0.97,2660.724,2661.358,So the next slide please.,75,,
392,0.97,2661.358,2671.668,"Basically, meaningful networking . How do we do that?",76,,
393,0.97,2671.668,2673.537,Had we effectively engage folks and continue that relationship?,76,,
394,0.97,2673.537,2677.841,Next slide please.,76,,
395,0.97,2677.841,2679.543,This is the organizations we engage with.,77,,
396,0.97,2679.543,2681.645,We are working with all of them.,77,,
397,0.97,2681.645,2688.252,It was mostly with African American folks.,77,,
398,0.97,2688.252,2689.253,We invited everybody to join.,77,,
399,0.97,2689.253,2701.965,We had a fantastic group who was created by the organization and we went through this trip of doing it Online.,77,,
400,0.97,2701.965,2707.538,And people were super engaged and wanting to do a session.,77,,
401,0.97,2707.538,2730.26,"The next which is happening tonight, the next session is the next case which is tackling different ways in which we want to share how does it work and the organization and they will talk to us about how--what they are looking for with engaging.",77,,
402,0.97,2730.26,2738.502,So next we will have four cohorts throughout the year and 100 people that would be engaging.,77,,
403,0.97,2738.502,2753.317,The goal is not only to provide this knowledge to individuals but for organizations so they can--we are hoping to do this ongoing in the future.,77,,
404,0.97,2753.317,2760.324,"Some of the topics we covered, they are basic.",77,,
405,0.97,2760.324,2772.603,What I have learned too is not only the participants but also the leaders of the organization who are updating these are very thankful of learning the skills that you only learn them by doing them.,77,,
406,0.97,2772.603,2790.254,"And as we are having different speakers and different departments and different numbers, everyone said, you are learning as we do it and the best way to engage is to actually participate.",77,,
407,0.97,2790.254,2791.622,So these are the different topics we cover.,77,,
408,0.97,2791.622,2794.525,Housing and city budget.,77,,
409,0.97,2794.525,2795.425,Bringing up the conversations.,77,,
410,0.97,2795.425,2801.265,We talk about data.,77,,
411,0.97,2801.265,2804.868,"This is, in general, what we talk about when we do the sessions.",77,,
412,0.97,2804.868,2805.502,And they are sure.,77,,
413,0.97,2805.502,2815.879,They are like 1.5 hour sessions.,77,,
414,0.97,2815.879,2818.081,They almost feel like a council meeting.,77,,
415,0.97,2818.081,2820.284,You have to be on point and click.,77,,
416,0.97,2820.284,2821.585,We have had great participants in the sessions.,77,,
417,0.97,2821.585,2832.229,"If you haven't been there, I would be calling you because we love to have real people talking about this and with the really appreciate the human side of who is making decisions.",77,,
418,0.97,2832.229,2838.468,We have had folks of all sorts talking to our members.,77,,
419,0.97,2838.468,2855.385,And so I would love to bring the community members here to tell us a little bit about why they wanted to join the partners and what so far has been their experience.,77,,
420,0.97,2855.385,2856.72,"I believe, Susan is on the line.",77,,
421,0.97,2856.72,2863.527,So if you can Unmute yourself and tell us why we wanted to do this and how it's going.,77,,
422,0.97,2863.527,2868.599,"Welcome, Susan.",78,,
423,0.97,2868.599,2871.602,Welcome Mya.,78,,
424,0.97,2871.602,2873.337,Thank you for all of your great work.,79,,
425,0.97,2873.337,2875.739,Please take it away.,79,,
426,0.97,2875.739,2882.713,We are having trouble hearing you.,80,,
427,0.97,2882.713,2883.146,Is a better?,81,,
428,0.97,2883.146,2891.388,Sorry about that.,82,,
429,0.97,2891.388,2896.96,Different platforms work differently.,83,,
430,0.97,2896.96,2904.201,We don't want to Miss anything you say because you have done such great work.,84,,
431,0.97,2904.201,2904.668,Is a better?,85,,
432,0.97,2904.668,2905.435,Much better.,86,,
433,0.97,2905.435,2913.477,Good morning.,87,,
434,0.97,2913.477,2919.95,I'm Susan Baldwin's executive director of the (Indiscernible) fund based right here in Seattle.,87,,
435,0.97,2919.95,2929.092,I'm here at the office on Capitol Hill central district.,87,,
436,0.97,2929.092,2929.96,Thank you for having me.,87,,
437,0.97,2929.96,2931.561,I'm very honored to be speaking with you today.,87,,
438,0.97,2931.561,2939.403,A little bit about the mission.,87,,
439,0.97,2939.403,2947.611,It is to support and promote leadership of indigenous women in the ongoing restoration of the--indigenous communities.,87,,
440,0.97,2947.611,2949.313,"Yes, that is kind of a broad mission statement.",87,,
441,0.97,2949.313,2951.381,One of the cornerstones is civic engagement.,87,,
442,0.97,2951.381,2957.387,"Last year, this is when I met Elsa.",87,,
443,0.97,2957.387,2964.628,Since this project kind of took over our lives for a while.,87,,
444,0.97,2964.628,2970.467,It was a very large endeavor.,87,,
445,0.97,2970.467,2981.645,"With Covid-19, it kind of just amplified all the challenging aspects of doing really good Community-Based education and outreach to get native folks to fill out the census.",87,,
446,0.97,2981.645,2983.413,And I think we did a good job.,87,,
447,0.97,2983.413,2992.522,"So far, preliminary results are that Washington tribes are up at least 15% in the reporting for the census.",87,,
448,0.97,2992.522,2996.526,And we don't know about urban natives yet.,87,,
449,0.97,2996.526,3000.03,We will get the results of that a little bit later.,87,,
450,0.97,3000.03,3001.932,We are all waiting for that.,87,,
451,0.97,3001.932,3007.971,It was also a lot of fun.,87,,
452,0.97,3007.971,3011.208,What I think it told the community members was that we can be a part of something bigger.,87,,
453,0.97,3011.208,3017.08,We can be a part.,87,,
454,0.97,3017.08,3017.581,Our voices matter.,87,,
455,0.97,3017.581,3023.653,Our voices matter.,87,,
456,0.97,3023.653,3029.059,So this is really following up on the heels of the senses.,87,,
457,0.97,3029.059,3035.599,Kind of civic engagement piece that has been quite exciting for us.,87,,
458,0.97,3035.599,3051.715,"And so what pace is bringing is, yes, we are learning about the mechanics of government and how things work and where the entry points for citizens to be involved in particular issues.",87,,
459,0.97,3051.715,3068.198,"And, but also, doing a little bit of a deeper dive and really kind of examining how this special place of native people can be involved in government.",87,,
460,0.97,3068.198,3073.77,And so we have worked to make the curriculum more culturally sensitive.,87,,
461,0.97,3073.77,3078.542,And talking about issues that we know native people care about.,87,,
462,0.97,3078.542,3084.748,So we are very excited to be participating in P.A.C.E.,87,,
463,0.97,3084.748,3087.651,And we get to meet the people.,87,,
464,0.97,3087.651,3101.832,"It is special for community members to interface directly with the Decision-Makers, you all and some of the folks that help make the city work.",87,,
465,0.97,3101.832,3103.467,We are thankful to also.,87,,
466,0.97,3103.467,3104.634,We are thankful to the team.,87,,
467,0.97,3104.634,3114.778,We are thankful to the Department of neighborhoods for making this opportunity available to us and we are just really excited.,87,,
468,0.97,3114.778,3116.613,So we want to thank you for your support of P.A.C.E.,87,,
469,0.97,3116.613,3120.984,And we are excited to be a part.,87,,
470,0.97,3120.984,3121.685,So thank you for listening.,87,,
471,0.97,3121.685,3130.861,And I think Mya is here with us.,88,,
472,0.97,3130.861,3131.595,I think Maia is with us.,88,,
473,0.97,3131.595,3134.798,Hello everyone.,89,,
474,0.97,3134.798,3135.298,I'm Mya.,89,,
475,0.97,3135.298,3141.271,On the corner at the urban League.,89,,
476,0.97,3141.271,3146.009,And we just finished our last session on Saturday.,89,,
477,0.97,3146.009,3156.152,"And so, I can kind of give you the sense of what it was like throughout the whole process.",89,,
478,0.97,3156.152,3171.735,"One thing I really appreciated is, we really wanted to empower our community to be able to get the information and be able to make steps moving forward within the community to make any changes that they know or want to do.",89,,
479,0.97,3171.735,3185.448,Every topic we provided to them says how we were getting this data over land or money.,90,,
480,0.97,3185.448,3186.149,They wanted it all.,90,,
481,0.97,3186.149,3190.487,They wanted all of that information.,90,,
482,0.97,3190.487,3203.533,"And at the very end, we were hearing how many of them wanted to apply for a grant to talk about recycling, to do a community event for the community specifically.",90,,
483,0.97,3203.533,3206.736,In their primary language.,90,,
484,0.97,3206.736,3214.544,"And talking about Healthcare, there were so many things.",90,,
485,0.97,3214.544,3221.084,They were willing to take what we learned back to the community and make moves and also feel more comfortable engaging in the process.,90,,
486,0.97,3221.084,3250.18,It can be very scary in terms of going through a process that Systemically and historically wasn't really for our communities and being able to be very intentional to provide all the speakers to look similar to them with being able to share not only their knowledge and expertise but how they got there.,90,,
487,0.97,3250.18,3255.218,"I think it is very empowering to see, there are people that look like me in this process.",90,,
488,0.97,3255.218,3259.189,And I am welcome to be in this space as well.,90,,
489,0.97,3259.189,3262.392,See might be getting a little more phone calls in the future.,90,,
490,0.97,3262.392,3267.797,May be more people at public meetings.,90,,
491,0.97,3267.797,3279.142,"And just more overall engaged with this process now, now that we are educated and we are looking forward to doing this in the future.",90,,
492,0.97,3279.142,3281.778,And we find it--I think it was really beneficial.,90,,
493,0.97,3281.778,3296.459,"Even I, who work on following severe Seattle, learn something too.",90,,
494,0.97,3296.459,3299.929,I think everybody would be very interested in joining this.,90,,
495,0.97,3299.929,3302.666,We have people who have their Phd's all the way to people who are currently in Undergrad.,90,,
496,0.97,3302.666,3314.077,It was very overall empowering and exciting and we are looking forward to doing this in the future.,90,,
497,0.97,3314.077,3314.511,Thank you so much.,90,,
498,0.97,3314.511,3315.378,"Thank you, Mya.",91,,
499,0.97,3315.378,3322.318,I want to highlight the fact that having the Cohort of people from Undergrads to Phd's creates that.,91,,
500,0.97,3322.318,3333.463,Education that is sometimes creating a deeper learning than if there is a power dynamic from Professor to student.,91,,
501,0.97,3333.463,3335.498,"And then also, Susan, I want to highlight what you said.",91,,
502,0.97,3335.498,3346.776,You said 14% increase in the Census track of our native American populations.,91,,
503,0.97,3346.776,3347.51,That is incredible.,91,,
504,0.97,3347.51,3352.082,"So Mya and Susan, I cannot thank you enough.",91,,
505,0.97,3352.082,3353.316,The committee would go on all day.,91,,
506,0.97,3353.316,3358.021,I know that some of my colleagues get tired of hearing me think people.,91,,
507,0.97,3358.021,3368.064,But I truly cannot thank you enough.,91,,
508,0.97,3368.064,3369.432,"Thank you, council member.",92,,
509,0.97,3369.432,3370.934,I think that concludes our presentation.,92,,
510,0.97,3370.934,3373.703,But thank you again for the opportunity to speak.,92,,
511,0.97,3373.703,3386.149,"As always, please, we would welcome coming back and talking more about the programs and also interested in Partnering with you in P.A.C.E.",92,,
512,0.97,3386.149,3387.55,Or other programs during these Covid-19 times.,92,,
513,0.97,3387.55,3394.09,I would notice--remind folks that neighbor day is may 8th.,92,,
514,0.97,3394.09,3400.93,"This year, we are asking folks to nominate neighbors who exemplify different acts of kindness.",92,,
515,0.97,3400.93,3410.173,So you can go on our Website and nominate somebody to be recognized during may 8th on neighbor day.,92,,
516,0.97,3410.173,3413.943,"I don't know if any folks have questions but if not, that concludes our presentation.",92,,
517,0.97,3413.943,3418.148,"Director, I did have a question that came in the back of my mind.",93,,
518,0.97,3418.148,3426.923,I have talked to Stci quite a bit about the design review process and we have transferred to a virtual nature.,93,,
519,0.97,3426.923,3430.093,I know that the historic boards have also done this.,93,,
520,0.97,3430.093,3441.271,"Similar to what I was talking about with the Cafc streets, we will need a little time to transition back to being in person.",93,,
521,0.97,3441.271,3448.044,And we want to make sure to keep all the benefits of the changes we experienced last year.,93,,
522,0.97,3448.044,3455.618,"And if you need to follow up with me later about this, I'm happy to meet with you at any time.",93,,
523,0.97,3455.618,3465.428,I just want to check to see if there are changes that you or your the members of your team have seen and the virtual landmark board process.,93,,
524,0.97,3465.428,3469.132,Or a certificate of approval process that you believe we should consider making permanent.,93,,
525,0.97,3469.132,3470.333,Thank you for that question.,94,,
526,0.97,3470.333,3485.515,"As you Referenced, we put in temporary protocols during the pandemic, at the beginning of the pandemic, where historic preservation staff can administratively review certain smaller applications and we very much have appreciated that.",94,,
527,0.97,3485.515,3493.957,"For example, reviewing things like awnings or Signage or outdoor seating in historic districts.",94,,
528,0.97,3493.957,3501.164,Two main thoughts come to mind.,94,,
529,0.97,3501.164,3513.243,"One is, allowing the staff to review this administratively, we enable our volunteer boards to really focus their time and attention on the larger projects and applications.",94,,
530,0.97,3513.243,3521.484,"For example, proposals that involve more significant alterations on historic structures or proposed demolition.",94,,
531,0.97,3521.484,3530.193,"And then we have reduced the burden of the process, the process burden on applicants for smaller business owners.",94,,
532,0.97,3530.193,3540.403,"And so, looking forward into 2021, we would be more than happy to work with you and the Committee on extending the temporary process beyond the duration of the pandemic.",94,,
533,0.97,3540.403,3541.037,That would be great.,95,,
534,0.97,3541.037,3552.615,Happy to work with you to keep the benefits of the last year and let the Tribulations of the last year passed by.,95,,
535,0.97,3552.615,3555.318,So thank you for all of your work.,95,,
536,0.97,3555.318,3556.386,"Thank you, Susan, Mya, Elsa.",95,,
537,0.97,3556.386,3558.054,You have done incredible work during a challenging last year.,95,,

545,0.97,3609.973,3617.08,I want to highlight that this is the last land use and neighborhoods committee.,100,,
546,0.97,3617.08,3621.05,We had both the director and the interim director.,100,,
547,0.97,3621.05,3622.085,"Today, we passed through the threshold.",100,,
548,0.97,3622.085,3624.587,And we have the director leading the charge.,100,,
549,0.97,3624.587,3625.154,"Welcome, director.",100,,

557,0.97,3653.383,3656.219,I'm the interim director for the office of planning and community development.,102,,
558,0.97,3656.219,3657.02,Really excited to be here today.,102,,
559,0.97,3657.02,3661.791,Good morning Councilmember Strauss.,103,,
560,0.97,3661.791,3673.202,My name is Christopher (Indiscernible) and I am the colleague at DCI.,103,,

562,0.97,3673.503,3674.57,Good morning everyone.,104,,
563,0.97,3674.57,3692.655,My name is Maggie the--and I am the colleague with the office of planning and community development.,104,,
564,0.97,3692.655,3693.623,Thank you Christopher and Magna Manke.,105,,
565,0.97,3693.623,3702.398,And also we have Councilmember Timmy Marlys.,105,,
566,0.97,3702.398,3702.965,Feel free to take it away.,105,,
567,0.97,3702.965,3713.376,I just want to add that Scci and Opcd became new departments in January of 2016 and we used to be one Department.,106,,
568,0.97,3713.376,3730.693,The Department of planning and development.,106,,
569,0.97,3730.693,3731.928,The administration of the time created Junior departments.,106,,
570,0.97,3731.928,3732.762,We decided to keep one change team.,106,,
571,0.97,3732.762,3734.564,One joint change team as we work closely together as two departments on so many issues.,106,,
572,0.97,3734.564,3735.164,I will add to that.,107,,
573,0.97,3735.164,3738.0,It is a great partnership.,107,,
574,0.97,3738.0,3745.007,Super important to the fabric of the work that we do and for the community.,107,,
575,0.97,3745.007,3758.621,Very happy to be doing this work together . We should have a quick conversation about why we are having this conversation.,107,,
576,0.97,3758.621,3759.388,And how we do this work.,107,,
577,0.97,3759.388,3770.633,"As you all know, the important work of the change team, of all of our change teams.",107,,
578,0.97,3770.633,3794.857,But the change team between Cdci and Abby cap--Opcd is around racial equity and how we embody a change in internal to our own departments and offices and also how the work extends into the work that we do with the community.,107,,
579,0.97,3794.857,3806.369,That is what we will talk with you about as we go through the slide presentation today.,107,,
580,0.97,3806.369,3806.636,Nathan.,107,,
581,0.97,3806.636,3809.505,I wanted to stress the two departments have continued with great collaboration.,108,,
582,0.97,3809.505,3819.382,"We have done a lot of equity, mini audits and reviews of our different divisions and how we work together.",108,,
583,0.97,3819.382,3824.72,And we have a shared training program.,108,,
584,0.97,3824.72,3825.154,Next slide.,109,,
585,0.97,3825.154,3842.371,"As part of the indigenous acknowledgment, I want to acknowledge that on behalf of Sdci and Opcd, we actively recognize we are on indigenous land.",110,,
586,0.97,3842.371,3850.913,For current Territories.,110,,
587,0.97,3850.913,3852.248,Next slide.,110,,
588,0.97,3852.248,3861.624,"Director, I want to take a moment on the last slide for the viewing public.",111,,
589,0.97,3861.624,3867.53,"Without historical context, can you go back to the last slide?",111,,
590,0.97,3867.53,3867.93,Slide three.,111,,
591,0.97,3867.93,3868.731,There we are.,111,,
592,0.97,3868.731,3877.84,"This might seem, to someone who doesn't--I'm a Land-Use Nerd.",111,,
593,0.97,3877.84,3889.852,"I have been spending too much time looking at the now and then of Seattle and watching Seattle channels and videos about the archives and where we come from, to get a better sense of how we can move forward.",111,,
594,0.97,3889.852,3896.425,I want to highlight that the slide is not a random collaboration of two photos.,111,,
595,0.97,3896.425,3900.997,This slide is a picture of a place that exists.,111,,
596,0.97,3900.997,3906.369,Now and then.,111,,
597,0.97,3906.369,3917.413,"Where the Seattle art museum sculpture garden is, was formerly a Shorefront.",111,,
598,0.97,3917.413,3917.914,Lacking better words.,111,,
599,0.97,3917.914,3919.148,And was where indigenous members of the community lived.,111,,
600,0.97,3919.148,3931.427,So this is an accurate representation of what the land was previously on what it is now.,111,,
601,0.97,3931.427,3941.771,I just wanted to take that moment to highlight for the viewing public that this was not a random collaboration of photos.,111,,
602,0.97,3941.771,3942.204,This is a place.,111,,
603,0.97,3942.204,3959.989,"If you go to the sculpture garden today, you are standing on Phil--fill and on a place where as the city grew and pushed native Americans further and further North, this was one place they lived for many years.",111,,
604,0.97,3959.989,3968.731,Thank you for that additional acknowledgment Councilmember.,112,,
605,0.97,3968.731,3974.203,Much appreciated.,112,,
606,0.97,3974.203,3979.141,"Magdala, thank you.",112,,
607,0.97,3979.141,3984.146,"And the slide, with these bullet points, I wanted to actually highlight the first few of them.",112,,
608,0.97,3984.146,3995.291,"In the partnership between us, we have been participating in the Rsji summit panel discussions.",112,,
609,0.97,3995.291,4003.432,We established a change team charter and charter committees.,112,,
610,0.97,4003.432,4007.336,Writing the Co- lead's letter to the Mayor.,112,,
611,0.97,4007.336,4044.84,"And in both of our offices, growing participation in other groups, which include a by caucus, white caucus and at Opcd, we have a leading Ith equity team which is centered around the work that we deliver out into the community and how we do it in a way that is in honor of the communities with whom we work.",112,,
612,0.97,4044.84,4045.074,Nathan.,112,,
613,0.97,4045.074,4053.616,We have created sharing Seattle stories and that is a Website that Compiles written and oral stories of leaders in Seattle with illustrations.,113,,
614,0.97,4053.616,4061.59,We have completed two racial equity Toolkits that I will talk about later in the presentation.,113,,
615,0.97,4061.59,4065.694,We are developing ongoing community agreements.,113,,
616,0.97,4065.694,4075.104,We went through a really important process at Sdci and with Opcd's help.,113,,
617,0.97,4075.104,4089.552,"When you enter the offices in the Seattle municipal tower and on the 19th floor, we had installed a historical mural of downtown.",113,,
618,0.97,4089.552,4094.323,An important exercise there was that we needed to include the indigenous history and communities as part of this presentation.,113,,
619,0.97,4094.323,4114.877,"As you can see in this picture, from the 19th floor lobby, that we acknowledged that issue and we are working on that.",113,,
620,0.97,4114.877,4139.101,I think all of you are very familiar about the initiative which allows us the opportunity to build trust and partnerships with the communities and just hoping to make investments in the power the change that we want to see.,114,,
621,0.97,4139.101,4143.873,We have new permanent advisory board.,114,,
622,0.97,4143.873,4149.612,We have numbers which were approved recently.,114,,
623,0.97,4149.612,4153.516,We are responding to community need.,114,,
624,0.97,4153.516,4159.989,We have over 30 projects we are working on and have contracts with community partners with currently.,114,,
625,0.97,4159.989,4171.333,"We are supporting other departments with grants, funding and planning including Oed and OEM.",114,,
626,0.97,4171.333,4192.788,"We are developing the Opcd equitable recovery principles document . In 2020, it was requested for them to collaborate on Participatory budgeting.",114,,
627,0.97,4192.788,4194.423,Because of the success of the Edi process we have in place.,114,,
628,0.97,4194.423,4198.928,We are creating equity indicators reports.,114,,
629,0.97,4198.928,4204.8,We have staff participating on the Rsjt leaders training.,114,,
630,0.97,4204.8,4216.579,And of course we are responding to the Sdhr survey.,114,,
631,0.97,4216.579,4219.548,Next slide.,114,,
632,0.97,4219.548,4242.204,"One of the important programs we have is, we have young indigenous planner that--or more than one that we bring into the Department every year to work with us and help grow the vision and the skill sets.",115,,
633,0.97,4242.204,4244.506,And that is ongoing.,115,,
634,0.97,4244.506,4251.714,I would suggest it is also growing.,115,,
635,0.97,4251.714,4255.384,"Current in turn, Sasha Remi, has been a great addition to the staff.",115,,
636,0.97,4255.384,4273.602,"Currently with her, we are working to end with Michael Hebner in our office.",115,,
637,0.97,4273.602,4275.571,We are working to prepare for our next investment related to major updates.,115,,
638,0.97,4275.571,4290.552,"And in looking at that work, how did we place a more indigenous framework on the work itself?",115,,
639,0.97,4290.552,4298.961,"This will be a very central piece to our work, with racial justice and in Digitalizing the plan.",115,,
640,0.97,4298.961,4299.094,.,115,,
641,0.97,4299.094,4301.864,"Director, can we sit on the last slide for just a moment.",116,,
642,0.97,4301.864,4310.172,I want to highlight.,116,,
643,0.97,4310.172,4313.142,This is a troubling history of how Seattleites have treated our indigenous population.,116,,
644,0.97,4313.142,4337.099,"While it has not--the worst of it may not have occurred in our Lifetimes but it is fresh history and at the beginning of my committees, I discuss how short our time is here, whether it is as electives or positions of decision-making power or just being alive on the planet.",116,,
645,0.97,4337.099,4347.543,I take this moment to recognize an article written by Brandon Kiley and the Seattle times regarding the history of Cal Anderson park.,116,,
646,0.97,4347.543,4351.38,And it discusses pathways.,116,,
647,0.97,4351.38,4359.722,I think it is often times overlooked.,116,,
648,0.97,4359.722,4364.927,White folk that came to the Northwest said this is very lush and prosperous land but nobody is using it.,116,,
649,0.97,4364.927,4377.039,They failed to recognize that the land was lush with food because of the millennia of permit culture and using the land.,116,,
650,0.97,4377.039,4384.813,Didn't have to have fences around the farms because they worked together in so many ways.,116,,
651,0.97,4384.813,4389.818,"And so, I come back to this to say that the article references pathways.",116,,
652,0.97,4389.818,4396.925,If we were to use the current words for these ways of traveling around the area.,116,,
653,0.97,4396.925,4414.409,"And then to also highlight, as I was in city hall park the other day, I recognized the fact that we have many statues and things within our community.",116,,
654,0.97,4414.409,4424.887,"At City Hall Park, there are still Cannonballs from the USS Decatur that were used to kill the indigenous population here in Seattle.",116,,
655,0.97,4424.887,4438.634,The article I Referenced about the history of Cal Anderson park speaks about the engagement between USS Decatur and the indigenous populations.,116,,
656,0.97,4438.634,4442.004,So I take that moment to recognize we have a lot of work to do.,116,,
657,0.97,4442.004,4447.209,A lot of work to do.,116,,
658,0.97,4447.209,4454.683,"While it may not have been in our Unexperienced in our life, it is still very fresh.",116,,
659,0.97,4454.683,4461.39,So thank you for your work on this.,116,,
660,0.97,4461.39,4463.926,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,117,,
661,0.97,4463.926,4480.709,"As we look at the work moving forward, one of the largest challenges I see is that it is established in a white majority framework by design.",117,,
662,0.97,4480.709,4510.239,"And while there are some very specific regulatory and legal requirements we have, we will be pushing up against him as we look at how we do this work differently and as a way that is respectful of passed Harms and current--next slide.",117,,

685,0.97,4656.952,4662.057,It covers Renter's writes plus tips and resources.,118,,

694,0.97,4824.886,4837.999,One of the--this slide goes into the external training and the department had supported that this year.,121,,
695,0.97,4837.999,4840.969,"Land-Use 101, we held three Trainings so far on that particular one.",121,,

703,0.97,4930.191,4950.178,The highlight of this summit was the leadership conference I think five of the black directors were involved in the discussion panel.,122,,
704,0.97,4950.178,4961.156,"And we talked about, what does black leadership and government look like during the time of black lives matter.",122,,

709,0.97,5002.964,5011.172,Also the program was suspended due to Covid-19.,123,,
710,0.97,5011.172,5038.666,The city--Sdci has--option for employees to have the chance to have different fields to lend (Indiscernible) and find areas they can fit in.,123,,
711,0.97,5038.666,5039.534,If they want to improve their careers.,123,,
712,0.97,5039.534,5040.535,And they were given a chance to ask questions.,123,,
713,0.97,5040.535,5050.211,And also interact with mentors that they are assigned to.,123,,
714,0.97,5050.211,5071.9,Mentorship programs and employees are allowed to (Indiscernible) for two of these this year with (Indiscernible) hours.,123,,

716,0.97,5079.24,5082.544,And especially for women of color.,123,,
717,0.97,5082.544,5090.919,"Also, a review of the process to include Antiracism.",123,,
718,0.97,5090.919,5097.725,So material for interview panels.,123,,

720,0.97,5115.543,5119.28,Not based on what documents are provided.,123,,
721,0.97,5119.28,5134.496,And so give me the same opportunity to apply for these jobs.,123,,
722,0.97,5134.496,5137.565,And based on their experience.,123,,
723,0.97,5137.565,5150.912,Not necessarily information for the Department.,123,,
724,0.97,5150.912,5154.249,"Thank you, Christopher.",124,,
725,0.97,5154.249,5162.123,"I'm going to go into some of the challenges, obstacles we were unable to navigate around.",124,,
726,0.97,5162.123,5172.734,This first bullet is not just limited to the institutions but the distance between people during this time and how to build trust in a remote environment was a challenge.,124,,
727,0.97,5172.734,5183.344,Another challenge that we wanted to highlight here was that we often depend on individuals to do the work.,124,,
728,0.97,5183.344,5188.65,These are often the same individuals.,124,,
729,0.97,5188.65,5195.723,And how to move that reliance from individuals to departments taking on Rsji work.,124,,
730,0.97,5195.723,5200.261,"Related to that bullet, there is often emotional labor that is not accounted for.",124,,
731,0.97,5200.261,5209.971,And there is an imbalance . and am speaking from experience versus offering support.,124,,
732,0.97,5209.971,5211.139,I will cross it over to Christopher.,124,,
733,0.97,5211.139,5213.875,And reducing challenges.,125,,
734,0.97,5213.875,5224.986,Having time to organize against white supremacy is a problem.,125,,
735,0.97,5224.986,5239.334,Not just having the (Indiscernible) all staff responding to the culture or centering on the most impacted in this culture.,125,,
736,0.97,5239.334,5254.983,Continuous sense of urgency makes it difficult to have time for inclusive and encourage Democratic and thoughtful decision-making.,125,,
737,0.97,5254.983,5258.987,To think on a long time basis.,125,,
738,0.97,5258.987,5265.226,And the consequences.,125,,
739,0.97,5265.226,5269.23,Also problem.,125,,
740,0.97,5269.23,5275.203,This slide goes into removing the barriers for some of the challenges we listed too.,126,,
741,0.97,5275.203,5287.482,One of the things--I will pass it to Christopher for the last part of the slide.,126,,
742,0.97,5287.482,5304.565,Removing the barriers of these challenges reflect on building (Indiscernible) and a shared--sharing in the belonging.,127,,
743,0.97,5304.565,5310.338,And the culture of belonging and inclusion.,127,,
744,0.97,5310.338,5317.378,The most important people in the community.,127,,
745,0.97,5317.378,5320.181,Looking at the impact and what it is.,127,,
746,0.97,5320.181,5335.296,"And creating an environment until center, voices for the black population in the culture.",127,,
747,0.97,5335.296,5336.297,"Thank you, Christopher.",128,,
748,0.97,5336.297,5340.668,And so a few more bullets related to some of the ways to eliminate the barriers.,128,,
749,0.97,5340.668,5360.221,"One that we have listed here is flexibility, scope, schedule and project, to Prioritize building relationships with communities rather than completing the projects and deadlines.",128,,
750,0.97,5360.221,5370.098,"And this is related to scope as well of, relating to realizing equity work is the work and finding ways to have it be a Foundational part of the work rather than an additive one.",129,,
751,0.97,5370.098,5380.608,"The last bullet, creating a culture of feeling forward as an antidote of professionalism.",129,,
752,0.97,5380.608,5386.013,Doing it in a way that recognizes the power Dynamics and biases that exist.,129,,
753,0.97,5386.013,5402.597,Knowing that white and male often just have to show the potential of leadership and women have to Reprove themselves over and over again.,129,,
754,0.97,5403.03,5410.338,Next slide.,130,,
755,0.97,5410.338,5435.396,"For events that happened last year, all of the demonstrations with the George Floyd incident, the staff of Opcd and Sdci were very much unhappy with the situations going on.",131,,
756,0.97,5435.396,5440.568,"There are reflections of anger, fear and joy.",131,,
757,0.97,5440.568,5450.945,And so the Department was two groups.,131,,
758,0.97,5450.945,5457.618,The groups critical to give staff a chance to have an area where they can discuss the issues among themselves.,131,,
759,0.97,5457.618,5464.525,Meeting at certain times of the week.,131,,
760,0.97,5464.525,5491.018,"So that will give everybody a chance to discuss further, having any issues held back because of facing (Indiscernible) employees for giving us a chance to discuss the issue without thinking of any consequences.",131,,
761,0.97,5491.018,5496.023,It was a good thing.,131,,
762,0.97,5496.023,5514.976,"In the Opcd and Sdci team, we bring articles that are written about some of this discrimination and culture.",131,,
763,0.97,5514.976,5521.382,We rode these articles and discuss them in the group and shared them with the entire team when necessary.,131,,
764,0.97,5521.382,5535.162,"Another issue we looked into was, (Indiscernible) summit discussion focused on Chinatown district.",131,,
765,0.97,5535.162,5550.711,"Because the discussion really took a look at how the culture was displayed between the employees, the staff and the city and the community.",131,,
766,0.97,5550.711,5560.121,And that brought out some elements that were very important to think about how it relates to the community.,131,,
767,0.97,5560.121,5566.627,"Thank you, Christopher.",132,,
768,0.97,5566.627,5567.628,And other space was created.,132,,
769,0.97,5567.628,5570.932,And this is something that Rico mentioned earlier.,132,,
770,0.97,5570.932,5580.141,Is the Rsji city wide letter to the Mayor helped center on some main issues.,132,,
771,0.97,5580.141,5587.715,Another item is the list of recovery principles which really brought a whole new level of commitment and equity work.,132,,
772,0.97,5587.715,5589.65,As a Foundational part of the work.,132,,
773,0.97,5589.65,5598.125,We also--another space was Edi convening's and Roundtables.,132,,
774,0.97,5598.125,5613.307,And one other place is the Rsj integrated presentation and the work that we continue to do.,132,,
775,0.97,5613.307,5620.081,I will now pass it to Nathan and Rico to go over our events.,132,,
776,0.97,5620.081,5633.995,This is a summary of the racial equity Toolkits that Opcd and Sdci completed in 2020.,133,,
777,0.97,5633.995,5637.431,"For Sdci, we did a racial equity Toolkit on blue beam implementation.",133,,
778,0.97,5637.431,5638.966,I will talk about that in the upcoming slide.,133,,
779,0.97,5638.966,5653.447,This is basically a technology project that ensures better and more expeditious review of plans going through the Department.,133,,
780,0.97,5653.447,5656.517,And we also did racial equity Toolkit on tree protections.,133,,
781,0.97,5656.517,5656.751,Rico.,133,,
782,0.97,5656.751,5666.994,"Thank you, Nathan.",134,,
783,0.97,5666.994,5672.133,So you see the bullet points on the right side of the slide.,134,,
784,0.97,5672.133,5682.243,"It talks about our Process., and I will talk about the Maritime strategy here in a couple of slides.",134,,
785,0.97,5682.243,5684.645,What we know is--and I will call response format.,134,,
786,0.97,5684.645,5695.423,We want to be very intentional about our outcomes which involve Stakeholders be present and listen in sincere ways.,134,,
787,0.97,5695.423,5716.243,"And then in the response, come back and say this is what we heard and how can we move the ball down field and that bullet around evaluating racial awareness and being accountable is really critical.",134,,
788,0.97,5716.243,5726.654,We are doing that in partnership with sound transit as we look at the stationary planning with the light rail expansion in.,134,,
789,0.97,5726.654,5733.194,"Like I mentioned before, I will talk about it with our Maritime strategy.",134,,
790,0.97,5733.194,5733.527,Next slide.,134,,
791,0.97,5733.527,5754.748,"First, talking about West Seattle and the Ballard light rail extensions, what we know is that, the program, if you will, will have a great positive impact to community in terms of mobility and transportation.",135,,
792,0.97,5754.748,5770.598,It also has negative impacts that need to be Medicated and that we need to organize ourselves around.,135,,
793,0.97,5770.598,5772.099,"And looking at racial equity outcomes, you can see this here.",135,,
794,0.97,5772.099,5794.255,We know that we are driving toward access to communities and low income populations and creating opportunities and that we want to avoid disproportionate impacts to the communities of color in the population of communities.,135,,
795,0.97,5794.255,5805.199,And the only way we will get there is through meaningful engagement and involvement and holding ourselves accountable to how we can implement on the input we hear and receive.,135,,
796,0.97,5805.199,5810.738,"The other part of the conversation, Operationalizing the racial equity outcomes.",135,,
797,0.97,5810.738,5824.852,"The planning group that we lead, we hold quarterly Ret convenience strategies and best practices around Sundering race.",135,,
798,0.97,5824.852,5834.195,And identifying emergent and Reoccurring needs through that process.,135,,
799,0.97,5834.195,5834.562,Next slide.,135,,
800,0.97,5834.562,5854.982,"With industrial and Maritime strategy, what our goal there--one of the many goals, improving equitable access to jobs and opportunity and understanding that through the Maritime and industrial job sectors.",136,,
801,0.97,5854.982,5862.022,That is a vehicle by which to do that.,136,,
802,0.97,5862.022,5877.438,And one of the things we are very aware of is that we need to remove the disparity of environmental health impacts that we know there is a disproportionate impact on communities of color.,136,,
803,0.97,5877.438,5887.181,"And knowing that being on indigenous lands, that there has been a disproportionate impacts that we need to solve.",136,,
804,0.97,5887.181,5893.854,We are also looking to assist communities and improve safety and health for workers.,136,,
805,0.97,5893.854,5904.131,Next line.,137,,
806,0.97,5907.334,5919.546,We did racial equity Toolkit on tree protections and looking forward to proposed tree regulations that will be coming forward later this year and this is a really complex and important topic.,138,,
807,0.97,5919.546,5933.594,We know that the by Puck communities do not have the same tree canopy as some of the wealthier communities and that is the problem.,138,,
808,0.97,5933.594,5948.709,"We also realize that looking at permitting actions, they can have some burdensome impact from a cost standpoint for applicants going to the process.",138,,
809,0.97,5948.709,5963.824,"One of the things they're looking at is, can we provide a permit fee discount for low income individuals . So can tree mitigation be provided with a payment in Leiu rather than on-site?",138,,
810,0.97,5963.824,5993.053,Can we provide tree maintenance subsidies click sort of balancing the public health benefits of tree canopy and foliage and also looking at some of the challenges of regulations and trying to balance those two.,138,,
811,0.97,5993.053,6007.601,So blue beam and limitation is a fantastic technology tool that we have started to pilot in Bipoc and should go throughout the Department by the end of the year.,139,,
812,0.97,6007.601,6018.078,So this is a tool that allows applicants and our staff to review plans together in Realtime and to actually make corrections to the plans in Realtime.,139,,
813,0.97,6018.078,6033.961,The racial equity issue here is that we may have one time applicants or applicants that don't have a lot of resources that are not going to have access to the tool or be able to afford the tool.,139,,
814,0.97,6033.961,6052.179,"So we did racial equity Toolkit on this issue and we just need to make sure that the applicants, who don't have access to this tool, are not burdened and can have an ultimate path to the permit processing.",139,,
815,0.97,6052.179,6061.422,And that the path is just as expeditious as those who could use the tool.,139,,
816,0.97,6061.422,6062.99,Coming to the goals.,140,,
817,0.97,6062.99,6067.961,Goals for 2021.,140,,
818,0.97,6067.961,6083.143,"The (Indiscernible) has always been flooded with questions like, what is the--team stand for or what do they do?",140,,
819,0.97,6083.143,6088.549,"And so in asking those questions, we decided to list--a laundry list of goals to complete this year.",140,,
820,0.97,6088.549,6094.655,I will go down the list and mention some of them.,140,,
821,0.97,6094.655,6128.989,The first goal is to live with equity and putting into practice--and (Indiscernible) and to develop a plan to walk and address issues brought by Issaquah staff.,140,,
822,0.97,6128.989,6129.623,Supporting employees of color.,140,,
823,0.97,6129.623,6130.224,Become Antiracist advocates.,140,,
824,0.97,6130.224,6137.397,Respond to and address all levels of Covid-19.,140,,
825,0.97,6137.397,6152.045,Create and share messages with Bipoc and Opcd staff and learning the ways to get involved.,140,,
826,0.97,6152.045,6175.002,"Have support and future collaboration with Socr, white, and my and (Indiscernible) so find ways to create a culture of trust and support.",140,,
827,0.97,6175.002,6175.602,This is one of the goals.,140,,
828,0.97,6175.602,6184.244,And we will talk about the goals.,140,,
829,0.97,6184.244,6190.551,That is right.,141,,
830,0.97,6190.551,6191.852,We have more goals.,141,,
831,0.97,6191.852,6196.557,So the top three here are related to the change team communication committee.,141,,
832,0.97,6196.557,6201.562,"So looking at the way we communicate, potentially having a newsletter.",141,,
833,0.97,6201.562,6217.044,Another way of sharing updates and also working with the communications team to collaborate citywide with other change team folks who Prioritize communications.,141,,
834,0.97,6217.044,6227.12,We also wanted to reach out to other departments to collaborate on the sharing sales stories project.,141,,
835,0.97,6227.12,6233.193,Anda few more goals to share how we have the continuing the work of the mural that Nathan had mentioned.,141,,
836,0.97,6233.193,6242.636,We also would like to create and support the Rsj resource library that everyone would have access to.,141,,
837,0.97,6242.636,6256.783,"And the last bullet here is, really creating, setting expectations at racial equity work is required for all of our staff.",141,,
838,0.97,6256.783,6261.088,And enforced and reflected through the (Indiscernible),141,,
839,0.97,6261.088,6277.704,I would like to take a moment to talk about the leap of equity goals.,142,,
840,0.97,6277.704,6296.156,I mentioned before we also have a team internal to Opcd which works in partnership with the change team to take the work we are doing internally and have the inform the work we are doing with community.,142,,
841,0.97,6296.156,6298.558,We do lead with equity in all of our work.,142,,
842,0.97,6298.558,6324.685,"And is a requirement, all staff for Opcd are required to do racial work training and support of our culture shift within the office to put focus on this very difficult and sometimes extremely painful work.",142,,
843,0.97,6324.685,6334.194,"As we look forward to the 2022 budget, understanding how we budget our work has a direct impact on what we can and cannot do.",142,,
844,0.97,6334.194,6365.025,"We are ensuring that racial equity loans is put in place and the equity team will help us do that to look at all of our proposals for what we are putting into the 2022 budget for consideration and making certain we do continue to put our money where our mouth is, as it were and ensure that the work we do is centered.",142,,
845,0.97,6365.025,6420.447,We are doing some work internally led by the equity team related to how we approach community engagement and developing community engagement around that to strengthen our public engagement through a racial equity loans including raising up racial equity best practices so that the Issaquah community is--we are really in partnership with the Issaquah partnerships--Bipoc communities and we are trying to hold ourselves accountable in this work.,142,,
846,0.97,6420.447,6427.554,And I think the next slide is a thank you slide.,142,,
847,0.97,6427.554,6438.298,"We have a huge team, Nathan Anaya, that help us to see this work forward.",142,,
848,0.97,6438.298,6441.501,And it could not be done without the huge list of names of folks here.,142,,
849,0.97,6441.501,6450.911,I would love to read through all of them.,142,,
850,0.97,6450.911,6468.528,I would just add that on a professional and personal notes and I know that Rico would agree with me that bleeding the Department during a pandemic and during a civil rights reckoning I think has been the greatest professional challenge of our lives.,143,,
851,0.97,6468.528,6485.912,And we are really looking at everything we do from how we interview employees to how we compensate employees and how we work with communities and how we work internally.,143,,
852,0.97,6485.912,6492.853,It is really hard work and it is exhausting and it is really inspiring.,143,,
853,0.97,6492.853,6495.455,The stories we are hearing from our Bipoc employees are heartbreaking.,143,,
854,0.97,6495.455,6510.237,But people are much more--they feel much more freedom to tell those stories and for that I'm really grateful.,143,,
855,0.97,6510.237,6511.972,"Nathan, thank you for adding that.",144,,
856,0.97,6511.972,6526.486,"I only came into this position in January--or came to the office in January but I have been doing this work simply as a black architect, for the last 27 years.",144,,
857,0.97,6526.486,6556.716,"High guess what I would say is that I came into this work with a strong belief that we could really enact social change and social justice through our environment work, the work of both Sdci and the office of planning community development.",144,,
858,0.97,6556.716,6566.993,We have more work to do then I can really get my head around.,144,,
859,0.97,6566.993,6574.0,"But I believe we all come to do it fully every day and we live through the work, through the pain of it.",144,,
860,0.97,6574.0,6586.346,I think of the work of the team and in body that work.,144,,
861,0.97,6586.346,6590.517,I'm proud to be a part of this family.,144,,
862,0.97,6590.517,6591.084,Thank you directors.,145,,
863,0.97,6591.084,6596.856,What I heard you say in your remarks--I heard you use the word challenge.,145,,
864,0.97,6596.856,6598.425,"And the words following that were, opportunity.",145,,
865,0.97,6598.425,6617.31,The opportunity to Reinspect how we are hiring and Reinspect the rules and how this impacts everyone's daily lives.,145,,
866,0.97,6617.31,6619.179,You are create--correct that it takes quite a bit of effort and emotional energy.,145,,
867,0.97,6619.179,6643.336,And this is to thank you for the content and intent.,145,,
868,0.97,6643.336,6644.304,I will let this fire truck go by.,145,,
869,0.97,6644.304,6652.912,Thank you to the sale of fire Department for all the work that you do.,145,,
870,0.97,6652.912,6663.156,"Magna, heard you talk about the need for scope schedule budget so you are not running to deadlines that are not necessary.",145,,
871,0.97,6663.156,6667.827,"In addition, I want to highlight the fact that the change team members, it is a rule in addition to the job they are hired for.",145,,
872,0.97,6667.827,6678.338,Want to take this moment to thank you for doing the extra work within your Department's.,145,,

877,0.97,6691.217,6698.725,"Thank you, chair for allowing me to come home and listen.",146,,
878,0.97,6698.725,6717.544,It is work that is really important to me as a former human rights Commission and someone that works on one of these--has worked on one of these Rets before and someone who has been the recipient of two recent letters from staff.,146,,
879,0.97,6717.544,6721.815,I first one to say that it is clear there is some really important work happening in community.,146,,
880,0.97,6721.815,6730.657,A lot of sort of changes in the way we do community engagement.,146,,
881,0.97,6730.657,6733.093,So I don't want to diminish that in any way.,146,,
882,0.97,6733.093,6738.998,"I also have been on the other end of that, working in community with the city in different capacities.",146,,
883,0.97,6738.998,6750.176,And just appreciate that there is an effort to do that.,146,,
884,0.97,6751.778,6754.514,"Councilmember, Morales.",147,,
885,0.97,6754.514,6756.316,It seems that your Internet may not be stable.,147,,

888,0.97,6775.001,6802.462,"Councilmember Morales, will you try turning off your camera if you are still able to hear us directors, from what you heard from Councilmember Morales, is there any follow-up you would like to provide as she is logging back in?",148,,

892,0.97,6839.265,6840.567,"Christopher, this is an incredibly detailed presentation.",149,,
893,0.97,6840.567,6858.351,"It is also difficult in many ways to coordinate the efforts of two separate departments understanding the beginning statements that as of 2016, the departments were ones that provides another added benefit.",149,,
894,0.97,6858.351,6870.83,I just want to call out the level of detail you have provided to date is more so than any of the other Rsji presentations I have received.,149,,
895,0.97,6870.83,6879.639,"So Christopher and Magna, your presentations have been very good and I cannot thank you enough.",149,,

899,0.97,6882.809,6883.343,The floor is yours.,151,,

901,0.97,6889.015,6897.457,"Thank you for all of the folks who do this, raising social justice and bringing us up to date on this stuff.",152,,
902,0.97,6897.457,6922.615,"I can say this, which is, as far as the chairman was saying earlier about the work we have to do, since being on counsel for running for counsel and understanding the issues from 2016 until now, there has been a dramatic change in the discussion about indigenous names and places.",152,,
903,0.97,6922.615,6926.586,There has been a dramatic change in the discussion about the effects of Colonization.,152,,
904,0.97,6926.586,6937.597,There has been a dramatic change of people adopting the language to describe the and not in a Victimization way but the reality.,152,,
905,0.97,6937.597,6943.269,"Finger-Pointing way but in a, this is history we have to Deconstruct and tell the truth.",152,,
906,0.97,6943.269,6949.275,And Sam (Indiscernible) a couple summers ago did a series on the and it was phenomenal.,152,,
907,0.97,6949.275,6950.777,I think was the Department of neighborhoods.,152,,
908,0.97,6950.777,6954.113,"Or maybe it was you, Nathan.",152,,
909,0.97,6954.113,6967.126,I have never read in any of the sale reports or documents from the city of Seattle government side where the actually listed Colonization as a reason for a lot of things.,152,,
910,0.97,6967.126,6976.336,That has always been something I have dealt with obviously has a former legal counsel to tribes and other groups.,152,,
911,0.97,6976.336,6977.403,But in a different context.,152,,
912,0.97,6977.403,7005.365,"To see it in a government document listing, whether you are talking about racism and all the other issues, but to actually see the effects of what Colonization has done and how you have changed history and how we determine, even with some of the issues we dealt with, with--what is the board that handles art and culture and buildings buildings.",152,,
913,0.97,7005.365,7007.433,"When everybody was screaming, save the show box.",152,,
914,0.97,7007.433,7010.269,"My issue is, who gets to decide what is historical?",152,,
915,0.97,7010.269,7014.04,Who gets to decide what is important and what really means a lot?,152,,
916,0.97,7014.04,7018.878,Is that the blue moon Trout--tavern.,152,,
917,0.97,7018.878,7023.583,Is at the show box or somewhere on Thornton Creek.,152,,
918,0.97,7023.583,7026.352,Is at a place where we know where indigenous people have lived here for Millennial?,152,,
919,0.97,7026.352,7033.96,The fact that we are having these conversations and it is an actual conversation and it is a difficult one sometimes.,152,,
920,0.97,7033.96,7038.965,We had a discussion and parks about the fake Totem poles at Pike place market.,152,,
921,0.97,7038.965,7044.704,A lot of it was just trying to have the conversation to educate people what that meant.,152,,
922,0.97,7044.704,7063.189,"So to hear you, director, speak the way you do and the way everybody does and certainly the superintendent, it really inspires me to know that the work we have done, the work I have done now that I'm officially an older, feels like there is progress and there is something to be celebrated.",152,,
923,0.97,7063.189,7068.394,It is not always gloom and doom.,152,,
924,0.97,7068.394,7070.129,I want to thank you and your team.,152,,
925,0.97,7070.129,7073.099,And I'm looking at Rico and smiling because he has been around and done great work.,152,,
926,0.97,7073.099,7078.938,Sometimes we have culture classes.,152,,
927,0.97,7078.938,7094.62,Of more want them to be a conversation of sharing our history and what it means and being honored and there is some history that doesn't need to be honored.,152,,
928,0.97,7094.62,7094.821,Cap.,152,,
929,0.97,7094.821,7098.057,I want to thank you for your work and all the staff put into.,153,,
930,0.97,7098.057,7098.825,And for your leadership.,153,,

934,0.97,7110.269,7115.041,We might save that one for later.,154,,
935,0.97,7115.041,7115.808,"That is Copyrighted, buddy.",155,,
936,0.97,7115.808,7122.682,I will wave it.,156,,
937,0.97,7122.682,7123.382,I will let you have it.,156,,
938,0.97,7123.382,7129.455,Now you are going to steal from me.,157,,
939,0.97,7129.455,7131.724,I will pay you royalties.,158,,
940,0.97,7131.724,7132.859,That is called Indian humor.,159,,
941,0.97,7132.859,7133.192,We can joke.,159,,
942,0.97,7133.192,7137.296,Thank you Councilmember Juarez.,160,,
943,0.97,7137.296,7137.864,Councilmember Morales.,160,,
944,0.97,7137.864,7139.599,I see you are back on the phone.,160,,
945,0.97,7139.599,7151.077,"Noting that we are bit over time and this is an important topic to discuss, Councilmember Morales, please mention anything you said.",160,,
946,0.97,7151.077,7153.112,I apologize again.,161,,
947,0.97,7153.112,7157.817,I have been kicked out of about every committee meeting because I have such bad Internet.,161,,
948,0.97,7157.817,7167.527,"What I was saying and I will be brief, I just want to make really clear that we have, as the Council, received two letters now.",161,,
949,0.97,7167.527,7183.409,There is clearly a lot of work that needs to be done within the city and how we treat one another and how we treat our workers.,161,,
950,0.97,7183.409,7203.129,"The example of the black brilliance project requesting the assistance of the Edi staff is telling because the staff to participate in that are now hearing retaliation for their participation . We know the citywide Co- leads are still waiting as I understand it, for the Mayor's response to the letter.",161,,
951,0.97,7203.129,7218.177,"I know that the change team staff, as the Councilmember, Strauss, said doing this for without additional compensation, they are asking--they are being asked to do extra work.",161,,
952,0.97,7218.177,7222.181,These are city workers who are people of color being asked to do extra work without compensation.,161,,
953,0.97,7222.181,7227.286,They fear retaliation.,161,,
954,0.97,7227.286,7233.392,"And so, all of that is to say that we have a lot of work to do.",161,,
955,0.97,7233.392,7242.768,We have city workers right now who are very worried about the security of their own jobs because they do this work.,161,,
956,0.97,7242.768,7264.39,"Because they are willing to call out institutionalized racism in their work setting and so, we need to acknowledge that and we need to make sure that workers are protected for doing this kind of work and for really leading by centering there lived experience.",161,,
957,0.97,7264.39,7269.228,I just wanted to say that.,161,,
958,0.97,7269.228,7270.963,"And I appreciate you, chair, for inviting me to purchase paid in the Converstion.",161,,
959,0.97,7270.963,7279.138,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,162,,

962,0.97,7282.575,7320.913,"I just wanted to thank Councilmember Rollins for your comments and concur with you that we do need to hold our staff close and care for our people because this is an incredibly difficult work that we are embarking on and people are putting themselves in the line of fire, at risk and putting the reputations and their work and their hearts out there.",163,,
963,0.97,7320.913,7339.332,"I appreciate the issue you are raising and I think that not only do we, as a city, have a huge amount of work to do, on our teams and with our staff, but we also have a huge responsibility.",163,,

1005,0.97,7557.449,7560.152,I will say that this is my fourth year serving on the Commission and I do just want to highlight the work Michael and his staff do.,180,,
1006,0.97,7560.152,7573.699,I think they do an amazing job of just really setting us up as a Commission with the specifics on the Dynamics of each project in setting the stage for us to perform our work.,180,,
1007,0.97,7573.699,7574.8,I know I'm a beneficiary of the work that they do.,180,,
1008,0.97,7574.8,7592.718,"So starting with Michael and the executive director role and moving down through Juliet and Valerie and Aaron, they do a lot of tangible work for the city that I just want to express my appreciation for with the work that they do.",180,,
1009,0.97,7592.718,7598.824,Very well said.,181,,
1010,0.97,7598.824,7601.06,And we are excited to finalize all the paperwork.,181,,

1013,0.97,7605.464,7612.972,The second picture down is the location in district six the shift water quality project.,181,,
1014,0.97,7612.972,7621.246,And it is incredible how much overlapping work the design Commission goes with so many different types of projects.,181,,
1015,0.97,7621.246,7622.648,"Here I am stealing your thunder, Michael.",181,,
1016,0.97,7622.648,7628.32,I will let you take it away.,181,,

1022,0.97,7652.144,7658.484,"As many of you know, the Commission was established 53 years ago now in 1968.",184,,
1023,0.97,7658.484,7668.127,And our rule are projects that affect the public.,184,,
1024,0.97,7668.127,7672.531,They are predominantly capital improvement projects that constitute a significant majority of our work.,184,,
1025,0.97,7672.531,7673.732,But we do other work as well.,184,,
1026,0.97,7673.732,7684.009,"We look at projects that proposed Street and alley, Skybridge is on major transportation projects, one of which we will highlight.",184,,
1027,0.97,7684.009,7689.548,And planning policy reviews which are becoming increasingly important for the Commission and their role.,184,,
1028,0.97,7689.548,7708.634,"And finally, the design Commission has and will continue to be the primary oversight for sound transit light rail investment as a public review body working with city of Seattle staff.",184,,
1029,0.97,7708.634,7717.076,Next slide.,184,,
1030,0.97,7717.076,7722.781,There are 10 commissioners who comprise the Commission.,184,,
1031,0.97,7722.781,7731.79,"We have commissioners that were required, professions required to represent architecture fine artists and a lay member, member of the community.",184,,
1032,0.97,7731.79,7732.591,The development community.,184,,
1033,0.97,7732.591,7736.495,"We are also required to have planners, Designers, engineers and architects.",184,,
1034,0.97,7736.495,7742.501,Landscape architect as well as a member of the YMCA get engaged program.,184,,

1036,0.97,7748.474,7751.41,Joe Crary who many of you may know from the Seattle center.,184,,
1037,0.97,7751.41,7752.611,Her work at the Seattle center.,184,,
1038,0.97,7752.611,7756.248,She will be filling the At- large position.,184,,
1039,0.97,7756.248,7769.628,And then Adam (Indiscernible) who is an architect and urban designer who will be filling the urban planner position.,184,,
1040,0.97,7769.628,7771.196,Next slide.,184,,
1041,0.97,7771.196,7780.205,We always like to center our work in the six design principles that I think the Commission holds important.,184,,
1042,0.97,7780.205,7807.432,"And know that when you come to the Commission, the Commission likes to use these values as a lens by which they look at projects and hopefully provide people who come before the Commission with input and direction on how to accomplish the six design values relative to their individual projects.",184,,
1043,0.97,7807.432,7809.568,Next slide.,184,,
1044,0.97,7809.568,7828.187,We like to show these every year is a good reminder to people to have a good understanding of outcome a word is the design Commission fit in the capital improvement program and projects that are subject to our review.,185,,
1045,0.97,7828.187,7835.761,"Police stations, fire stations, parks and community centers.",185,,
1046,0.97,7835.761,7839.765,The typical capital improvement projects for the Commission to evaluate.,185,,
1047,0.97,7839.765,7846.572,We also have a significant amount of time on projects seeking Street and alley vacations.,185,,
1048,0.97,7846.572,7852.611,"Many of you may remember that in 2018, the city council really changed significantly, the street and alley vacation process.",185,,
1049,0.97,7852.611,7897.556,"In particular, elevating the role of the Commission as the initial touch point with the city to look for the Commission to have the opportunity to provide early and put on a request, not only for the implication but not just removing a street or alley from service but what types of public benefits should be developed that offset--offset the loss of the function of the Right-Of-Way in an attempt to create a stronger and--a stronger public realm as a result of the loss of the street or alley.",185,,
1050,0.97,7897.556,7901.46,Next slide.,185,,
1051,0.97,7901.46,7909.167,We like to show the city in the context of all the projects we looked at an 2020.,186,,
1052,0.97,7909.167,7914.172,"You can see for the most part, the design Commission has touched almost all neighborhoods in the past year.",186,,
1053,0.97,7914.172,7921.246,Unfortunately we haven't been able to review any projects in West Seattle this year.,186,,
1054,0.97,7921.246,7922.247,My apologies to West Seattle.,186,,
1055,0.97,7922.247,7925.484,Looking forward to projects soon.,186,,
1056,0.97,7925.484,7933.225,Also the bulk of the projects tend to be in the inner city but for the most part are distributed throughout the city.,186,,
1057,0.97,7933.225,7947.005,As well as and you can see a marker here for citywide.,186,,
1058,0.97,7949.474,7959.618,Next slide.,186,,
1059,0.97,7964.189,7975.233,Showing the number of projects and meetings and breaking down these projects that come before us.,187,,
1060,0.97,7975.233,7981.106,Capital projects or Right-Of- way projects which include Street and alley.,187,,
1061,0.97,7981.106,7985.744,One of which we will talk about in a moment.,187,,
1062,0.97,7985.744,7987.145,And plans or interest to the Commission.,187,,
1063,0.97,7987.145,7992.584,The following slides will provide a focused look at each category.,187,,
1064,0.97,7992.584,7995.22,Next slide please.,188,,
1065,0.97,7995.22,8015.674,"2019-2020 we saw slight reduction in the number of projects and not surprisingly, the pandemic has changed the way we were and changing the ability for city departments to bring forward projects.",189,,
1066,0.97,8015.674,8019.344,We have not seen as great of a dip in the number of projects between 2019-2020.,189,,
1067,0.97,8019.344,8033.759,"I have a feeling that subsequent years, because of the delay in funding that has occurred from the pandemic, we may see it a little bit.",189,,
1068,0.97,8033.759,8043.969,Next slide.,189,,
1069,0.97,8044.836,8051.877,"You can see here again with the number of meetings, there is a proportional drop as well.",190,,
1070,0.97,8051.877,8052.744,"2019, we had 47 meetings.",190,,
1071,0.97,8052.744,8055.781,"2020, 37 meetings.",190,,
1072,0.97,8055.781,8061.72,"Not surprisingly, a function of the pandemic.",190,,
1073,0.97,8061.72,8071.43,And some Scaling back on some projects that are coming before us by city departments and private development.,190,,
1074,0.97,8071.43,8071.73,Next slide.,190,,
1075,0.97,8071.73,8076.668,"Again, similar statistics.",191,,
1076,0.97,8076.668,8083.341,"If you want to follow up with me later on any of the Statistics that you are seeing here, happy to spend some time with you.",191,,
1077,0.97,8083.341,8088.747,We think it is valuable in particular to track this kind of work.,191,,
1078,0.97,8088.747,8106.965,It certainly gives us an understanding of the focus the Commission has and the time we spend and how we can be either more efficient or look for additional time or energy on projects that the Commission might be interested in.,191,,
1079,0.97,8106.965,8107.265,Next slide.,191,,
1080,0.97,8107.265,8120.779,"Finally, this sort of gives a number figure to the value of the projects that come before us.",192,,
1081,0.97,8120.779,8122.314,The Commission last year spent a combined 800 hours of their time.,192,,
1082,0.97,8122.314,8128.386,Almost 90% of which is Billable.,192,,
1083,0.97,8128.386,8129.788,10% is not Billable.,192,,
1084,0.97,8129.788,8136.828,I attribute it and Justin was very kind to call out staff.,192,,
1085,0.97,8136.828,8145.637,The Commission is very fortunate to have four staff people that provide the 10 commissioners with the ability to have the type of hours they spend.,192,,
1086,0.97,8145.637,8157.716,And really focusing on meetings and providing the direct impact to the projects that come before us.,192,,
1087,0.97,8157.716,8161.086,We are very fortunate to provide them with that kind of support.,192,,
1088,0.97,8161.086,8168.026,I generally appreciate the time staff spends as well.,192,,
1089,0.97,8168.026,8168.326,Next slide.,192,,
1090,0.97,8168.326,8175.734,I will throw this to Justin and he will walk you through three specific projects that the Commission looked at last year.,193,,
1091,0.97,8175.734,8177.736,"Thank you, Michael.",194,,
1092,0.97,8177.736,8189.447,I just want to give you a sense of the type of work we have been doing over the past year and some of the representative projects from some of these different pots Michael outlined.,194,,
1093,0.97,8189.447,8191.95,I will share one interagency project which is one you see on the screen.,194,,
1094,0.97,8191.95,8202.36,One capital project and one of the street vacations we dove into.,194,,
1095,0.97,8202.36,8210.869,"Starting with Sr520, we reviewed the Portage Bay and Roanoke bridges this past year, which is a combination of over 10 years of work.",194,,
1096,0.97,8210.869,8211.336,Working with D.O.T.,194,,
1097,0.97,8211.336,8220.078,To elevate the urban design goals and outcomes of the Seattle portion of the freeway.,194,,
1098,0.97,8220.078,8222.781,We recently finished up our work with D.O.T.,194,,
1099,0.97,8222.781,8224.482,On the motley bridge and portion of 520.,194,,
1100,0.97,8224.482,8232.457,"As that moved into construction, we shifted our focus to the Portage Bay portion.",194,,
1101,0.97,8232.457,8238.897,"In 2014, the Commission undertook a review requested by the Council to develop recommendations on potential bridge.",194,,
1102,0.97,8238.897,8247.439,And at that time we supported a design with elements to reflect the unique context of Portage Bay and these surroundings in that area.,194,,
1103,0.97,8247.439,8257.215,"Much of 2019, we evaluated the specific design concepts for this replacement of the Portage Bay bridge.",194,,
1104,0.97,8257.215,8266.524,And a segment over the Roanoke portion on the left part of your screen.,194,,
1105,0.97,8266.524,8272.063,The third part of the review was the creation of active and passive local and regional recreational facilities.,194,,
1106,0.97,8272.063,8279.938,All of this work culminated in April last year with a report to W.S.D.O.T.,194,,
1107,0.97,8279.938,8287.045,"Which we also shared to the Council into the Mayor, recommending urban design solutions for these different project elements.",194,,
1108,0.97,8287.045,8298.156,Michael gave some good insight about the basic principles and values that we take into any of the project reviews and some of those were modified slightly for this.,194,,
1109,0.97,8298.156,8300.659,I just want to give you a taste of some of these principles here.,194,,
1110,0.97,8300.659,8316.808,We based our review on ensuring there was a strong belief in using engineering solutions as opportunities to create distinct spaces and places and to elevate just beyond the function of the infrastructure.,194,,
1111,0.97,8316.808,8322.58,And I think the second project we will dive into will also reflect that type of focus.,194,,
1112,0.97,8322.58,8331.523,We also wanted to promote solutions that enhance human activity and design detail materials and in the execution.,194,,
1113,0.97,8331.523,8338.263,There is a strong focus to promote design of structures and facilities that reduce the visual and physical impacts.,194,,
1114,0.97,8338.263,8346.805,And it is especially key in this sensitive waterway.,194,,
1115,0.97,8346.805,8351.543,And allowing individuals with limited or special needs to have the same quality experience as those who are Able-Bodied.,195,,
1116,0.97,8351.543,8362.921,These core principles fit into the letter of support and they highlight some of the following outcomes starting off with the Roanoke lid.,196,,
1117,0.97,8362.921,8377.569,The project team was able to achieve the experience for the local folks next to the lid and provided Right-Of-Way connections that reflected the local context in both the materials and the details of the design.,196,,
1118,0.97,8377.569,8395.82,Another important piece of this was creating gateways that incorporated human skill features as this is a big connection point for a lot of regional connections.,196,,
1119,0.97,8395.82,8408.266,"And the last piece on the lid was, the team was really able to facilitate an amazing viewpoint for both local and territorial bill Geographies in the area.",196,,
1120,0.97,8408.266,8416.775,"With respect to the city and regional trail investments that I touched on a little bit, the project really allowed for direct and intuitive trail experiences.",196,,
1121,0.97,8416.775,8429.087,For users of all ages and abilities . There was a strong focus of the Multimodal connections and Wayfinding abilities through the site and on the site.,196,,
1122,0.97,8429.087,8442.801,"The project really included outcomes that promoted enhanced Sustainability and environmental stewardship, which is a really big focus of the Commission and our reviews.",196,,
1123,0.97,8442.801,8452.777,"The final piece there is the street furniture including the lighting, the Signage and the seating was designed and organized in a Legible and Contextual manner.",196,,
1124,0.97,8452.777,8457.115,The final piece of the review here was with the Portage Bay bridge.,196,,
1125,0.97,8457.115,8466.124,"And with our letter here, we reiterated support of the support approach we had in 2018.",196,,
1126,0.97,8466.124,8471.196,"And that design reflected the new context of Portage Bay, really serving as a good neighbor.",196,,
1127,0.97,8471.196,8477.268,I think that is something we kept coming back to as having this massive structure be a good neighbor in the context of the space.,196,,
1128,0.97,8477.268,8488.446,We were huge proponents of a design that symbols and rated the vertical columns with the horizontal elements of the structure.,196,,
1129,0.97,8488.446,8497.021,"And another piece that was really important to us was having the vertical components of the bridge that were above the bridge deck including the lighting, utilities and Signage.",196,,
1130,0.97,8497.021,8500.658,Having those all integrated into the bridge structure.,196,,
1131,0.97,8500.658,8504.963,"So again, this has been a long partnership with W.S.D.O.T.",196,,
1132,0.97,8504.963,8511.469,And we look forward to continuing to work with the Council and with W.S.D.O.T.,196,,
1133,0.97,8511.469,8519.978,To get the final outcomes of this project as it moves into the next phase and we really appreciate W.S.D.O.T .'s partnership and ongoing collaboration with this work.,196,,
1134,0.97,8519.978,8526.618,Truly elevate the urban design focus within such a large infrastructure project.,196,,
1135,0.97,8526.618,8528.319,"So next up, if you can go to the next slide.",196,,
1136,0.97,8528.319,8533.191,"Justin, I have a question.",197,,
1137,0.97,8533.191,8535.894,Thank you.,197,,
1138,0.97,8535.894,8539.13,This is incredible work talking about the connection of pathways.,197,,
1139,0.97,8539.13,8543.301,"We know that as we connect pathways, we are able to extend the amount of space.",197,,
1140,0.97,8543.301,8546.871,A look at it in this way.,197,,
1141,0.97,8546.871,8559.183,"When we have separate places that have good networks of connection, they are separated and we bridge them literally in this situation and we are able to create so many more connections.",197,,
1142,0.97,8559.183,8559.717,It is exponential.,197,,
1143,0.97,8559.717,8576.034,"One of the things really important to me, as I review and look at the environment, is making sure the built environment is accessible for all agencies, ages and abilities.",197,,
1144,0.97,8576.034,8590.048,"Is there anything you can speak to about this project--I know that sometimes a bench, if it is tilted with a place for people to push up, it allows for folks that have mobility challenges to sit and get out of the bench more easily.",197,,
1145,0.97,8590.048,8597.021,And they need benches to be able to navigate open space so they can rest and continue moving.,197,,
1146,0.97,8597.021,8602.86,Can you speak to the all ages and abilities components of your work?,197,,
1147,0.97,8602.86,8606.364,I can definitely give a couple of examples on this project.,198,,
1148,0.97,8606.364,8609.968,"And if you have others, Michael, please Chime in.",198,,
1149,0.97,8609.968,8624.849,"One of the major points of focus on this review is connecting to the regional path that runs along 520 and goes under, on the right side of the screen, on the East side of the Portage Bay bridge.",198,,
1150,0.97,8624.849,8637.095,He goes under the Portage Bay Bridge and will connect on to the Portage Bay Bridge and run up a pretty steep slope to get up to the Roanoke lid.,198,,
1151,0.97,8637.095,8651.876,And so that Pathway has to do the dual role of being that regional connection for all these folks jumping on their bike and coming from the East side and it also has to be that local Connector for folks of many abilities to be able to access this.,198,,
1152,0.97,8651.876,8658.916,And so we spent a lot of time on that approach on the East side.,198,,
1153,0.97,8658.916,8667.125,"Ensuring that that was--it was kind of a circuitous ramp from the low grade under the bridge, to get back up to the bridge.",198,,
1154,0.97,8667.125,8679.437,And it was bouncing--balancing different factors of being an effective regional route and making sure it is accessible for everyone.,198,,
1155,0.97,8679.437,8684.342,We don't want to make it to circuitous but we wanted to make sure the grades allow for that access.,198,,
1156,0.97,8684.342,8692.45,That was such a huge focus to have all those different constraints.,198,,
1157,0.97,8692.45,8707.165,"And when folks get on the bridge, is very place for them to rest and pause and take in the sights quick so that was another piece where a lot of a lot of intention was made.",198,,
1158,0.97,8707.165,8710.101,To make sure that it was an accessible infrastructure project.,198,,
1159,0.97,8710.101,8711.502,"Michael, do you have any others coming to mind on your side?",198,,
1160,0.97,8711.502,8718.176,It is always a vision by city departments.,199,,
1161,0.97,8718.176,8719.744,I think what Justin indicated is one of many tools.,199,,
1162,0.97,8719.744,8732.857,Rumble strips that help keep all that have less ability or less vision who may be using a device to guide them through the realm.,199,,
1163,0.97,8732.857,8734.158,And the list goes on and on.,199,,
1164,0.97,8734.158,8739.23,I think we are fortunate to have city departments in the partnership here with W.S.D.O.T.,199,,
1165,0.97,8739.23,8741.699,That is the baseline.,199,,
1166,0.97,8741.699,8749.507,"We are fortunate that the departments that we see, all ages and abilities in their work.",199,,
1167,0.97,8749.507,8750.274,So it makes our job easier.,199,,
1168,0.97,8750.274,8757.615,Thank you both.,200,,
1169,0.97,8757.615,8767.191,"The last point, editorial point I will make here is that when we put lids on our roadways, we reopen the public space.",200,,
1170,0.97,8767.191,8771.229,Mercer Island is lucky enough to have lids over there.,200,,
1171,0.97,8771.229,8771.929,The Interstate 90 section.,200,,
1172,0.97,8771.929,8773.131,We are likely to have that.,200,,
1173,0.97,8773.131,8779.537,Sam Smith park and Jimi Hendrix park.,200,,
1174,0.97,8779.537,8781.706,And looking to live the rest of Interstate five.,200,,
1175,0.97,8781.706,8792.15,"When we come out of this pandemic, I would love to join you, Michael and Justin at the Roanoke to look at all of this great work you have done.",200,,
1176,0.97,8792.15,8792.517,So thank you.,200,,
1177,0.97,8792.517,8794.752,We appreciate that.,201,,
1178,0.97,8794.752,8804.362,"And he spoke to one of our projects that we did review the last year, the Interstate five project which I was Recused from because I'm part of the Projectteam delivering that.",201,,
1179,0.97,8804.362,8812.837,"As a Commission, we are huge fans of basically reclaiming and creating space where there was not space before.",201,,
1180,0.97,8812.837,8826.951,"And not just stopping there but who do we create the space for, is a huge question and something the city needs to wrestle with before creating that space.",201,,
1181,0.97,8826.951,8828.319,I think you are preaching to the choir here.,201,,
1182,0.97,8828.319,8828.686,Well said.,202,,
1183,0.97,8828.686,8834.859,I will jump into the next project.,203,,
1184,0.97,8834.859,8837.795,"And I know it is another one that speaks to you, Councilmember Strauss.",203,,
1185,0.97,8837.795,8840.998,If you can slide forward two slides.,203,,
1186,0.97,8840.998,8841.699,One more slide here.,203,,
1187,0.97,8841.699,8849.407,We will talk about the Ballard pump station.,203,,
1188,0.97,8849.407,8855.279,This is a public facing portion of a really massive public infrastructure project that is 90% underground.,203,,
1189,0.97,8855.279,8858.616,So the public is not seeing most of the infrastructure being created here.,203,,
1190,0.97,8858.616,8872.964,"But we at the Commission feel it is really important to highlight the work the infrastructure is doing for us as the public, through an engaging and vibrant design that really invites the public to desert in and E█Ngage.",203,,
1191,0.97,8872.964,8875.566,The project team has done an amazing job creating that and facilitating that.,203,,
1192,0.97,8875.566,8883.207,"A review of the project in 2020, it was the third review of the project.",203,,
1193,0.97,8883.207,8885.61,We had previous reviews in 2018 and 2019.,203,,
1194,0.97,8885.61,8890.448,There was some pretty massive design changes from Spu.,203,,
1195,0.97,8890.448,8891.916,That led to another review this year.,203,,
1196,0.97,8891.916,8916.574,"Back in 2019, some of the pieces that we challenged the product project team to elevate and focus on when they were Iterating the project was treating the pump station come the 24th Avenue shoreline Street end and also the future development parcel that is part of the project on the self East side.",203,,
1197,0.97,8916.574,8921.846,Treating them as an integrative approach to place making instead of having a piecemeal approach to that.,203,,
1198,0.97,8921.846,8931.689,And we stress that they needed to elevate the role of the artist and the art who was a native artist in the concept and design.,203,,
1199,0.97,8931.689,8938.195,Not having and of pop art at a later after the fact and not integrated.,203,,
1200,0.97,8938.195,8945.803,The last piece was having a focus on developing partnerships and a program from the long-term management of the landscape plan.,203,,
1201,0.97,8945.803,8947.071,It featured a tree farm.,203,,
1202,0.97,8947.071,8956.314,"With the latest generation that the project team came back with here in 2020, we were really Mpressed with the work that Spu did with addressing these issues.",203,,
1203,0.97,8956.314,8973.097,And some of the things that I think really just got us excited and happy about the progress was the way they enhanced the architecture and the design through the use of lighted mash wrapped around the aboveground water elements.,203,,
1204,0.97,8973.097,8979.236,So a modern approach to celebrating the infrastructure as I talked to before.,203,,
1205,0.97,8979.236,8992.016,We have talked to some of the Neoclassical designs of infrastructure like the (Indiscernible) house at Cal Anderson park and this continues and updates a Traditin of not trying to hide the infrastructure but really celebrating it.,203,,
1206,0.97,8992.016,8999.89,The team also worked to elevate and enhance the role of the on and Off-Site green water storm infrastructure.,203,,
1207,0.97,8999.89,9000.324,They worked too.,203,,
1208,0.97,9000.324,9010.568,Equitable outcomes in the design through the inclusion of the indigenous--Maritime themes.,203,,
1209,0.97,9010.568,9016.874,The artist Jeffrey very was brought in to work on this project and incorporated at the concept level.,203,,
1210,0.97,9016.874,9018.976,So that is something we appreciated.,203,,
1211,0.97,9018.976,9020.077,And his art is amazing.,203,,
1212,0.97,9020.077,9024.882,"If you haven't seen it before, please check it out.",203,,
1213,0.97,9024.882,9027.885,It is the black Panther comic cover which is my favorite piece.,203,,
1214,0.97,9027.885,9033.958,He has a lot of really great work.,203,,
1215,0.97,9033.958,9034.692,Back to the project.,203,,
1216,0.97,9034.692,9043.0,The updated project also maximizes the connection with the 14th Avenue s Street end which we thought was a key feature of the project.,203,,
1217,0.97,9043.0,9054.478,And I think the last piece I will touch on here is the team did expand the tree farm concept so that it can be used by Spu and other projects.,203,,
1218,0.97,9054.478,9056.714,They have been pushing hard to make this a public Amenity.,203,,
1219,0.97,9056.714,9060.818,And both through the physical manifestation and as an Amenity moving forward.,203,,
1220,0.97,9060.818,9062.219,And so we really appreciated that piece.,203,,
1221,0.97,9062.219,9065.823,So that is it for the pump station.,203,,
1222,0.97,9065.823,9066.657,I think we have one more slide.,203,,
1223,0.97,9066.657,9073.297,"When you come to Ballard, I have some things to say.",204,,
1224,0.97,9073.297,9080.638,Thank you again for highlighting the indigenous artist here.,204,,
1225,0.97,9080.638,9081.539,It is very important.,204,,
1226,0.97,9081.539,9092.85,"Especially per the last conversation that we had, to recognize the site that this pump station is on was the site of a native American village here.",204,,
1227,0.97,9092.85,9105.129,"On the map that I have from the work Museum for culture and the University of Washington, it is named and tucked away inside.",204,,
1228,0.97,9105.129,9106.163,This is a village site.,204,,
1229,0.97,9106.163,9113.137,This is where people have lived for millennia.,204,,
1230,0.97,9113.137,9114.171,That is my editorial comment.,204,,
1231,0.97,9114.171,9127.251,"My other aspect is that, I have so hoping that will also be remaining to be able to be done throughout the future.",204,,
1232,0.97,9127.251,9133.257,Because Connectionsth waterways for people is important.,204,,
1233,0.97,9133.257,9134.592,And the access will be there.,205,,
1234,0.97,9134.592,9146.504,"To touch on your last point, I think having Jeffrey come in can create some beautiful art that is integrated in the space.",205,,
1235,0.97,9146.504,9153.611,And I think it pays a lot of respect to that history.,205,,
1236,0.97,9153.611,9156.313,His peace is called octopus woman.,205,,
1237,0.97,9156.313,9158.949,And I loved his first Iteration which they found was not really structurally feasible.,205,,
1238,0.97,9158.949,9167.925,So he had to make some changes to the design to make it a little more feasible.,205,,
1239,0.97,9167.925,9170.928,But I recommend everyone see that piece before it is constructed here pretty shortly.,205,,
1240,0.97,9170.928,9176.834,And then go visit the site often.,205,,
1241,0.97,9176.834,9187.411,"Councilmember Strauss, one thing that was important for the Commission here was the disposition of the Yankee Diner site.",206,,
1242,0.97,9187.411,9196.921,"And discussions with Seattle public utilities, it is clear that the site will need to remain in service for them through construction which will probably be 2026 or beyond.",206,,
1243,0.97,9196.921,9202.86,"However, in conversations with Spu, we had some good conversations about after that.",206,,
1244,0.97,9202.86,9208.098,What is the highest and best Maritime or public use for that property?,206,,
1245,0.97,9208.098,9226.483,And how can the designs here either not inhibit future development there or preferably create a larger hole for the Yankee site here.,206,,
1246,0.97,9226.483,9236.126,"Again, we had some really good conversations about that and we are looking forward to participating with them in the future disposition of the Yankee Diner site.",206,,
1247,0.97,9236.126,9242.099,I think one of the things you just highlighted was something the Commission places a huge focus on.,207,,
1248,0.97,9242.099,9247.871,Having that long-range vision and we know there are budget constraints.,207,,
1249,0.97,9247.871,9258.816,"But if we don't finish projects when we have the initial push, a lot of times, they never get finished.",207,,
1250,0.97,9258.816,9289.58,"I think another project that I can look out from my window here from the office is the Madison Street pedestrian bridge that connects over to the waterfront and the ferry and I think that is another project for a few years back, we didn't make a huge emphasis on finishing the project because we would hate to see this beautiful project completed 90% of the way and then have this really poor finish to the project that may never see funding.",207,,
1251,0.97,9289.58,9299.79,So I think Michael hits on a really important piece there that we focus on a lot of the reviews.,207,,
1252,0.97,9299.79,9307.765,Last editorial point here is the adjacent shipyard is a co-op that was founded in 1946.,208,,
1253,0.97,9307.765,9327.017,"Before that, it was built in minesweepers that were were transformed into the calypso.",208,,
1254,0.97,9327.251,9328.852,And John Wayne's wild goose.,208,,
1255,0.97,9328.852,9337.895,Not only on co-ops not something we see as often any longer but they also created some of the most famous ships in the world.,208,,
1256,0.97,9337.895,9338.395,That is awesome.,209,,
1257,0.97,9338.395,9344.668,I don't know if you have Wikipedia up or if this is off the top of the head.,210,,
1258,0.97,9344.668,9350.507,Top of the head it.,211,,
1259,0.97,9350.507,9352.409,Thank you for this.,211,,
1260,0.97,9352.409,9352.943,Feel free to continue on.,211,,
1261,0.97,9352.943,9353.677,Thank you very much.,212,,
1262,0.97,9353.677,9359.316,We just have a few more views of this project.,212,,
1263,0.97,9359.316,9362.82,The street end that you mentioned.,212,,
1264,0.97,9362.82,9364.254,Putting your boat in the water.,212,,
1265,0.97,9364.254,9365.723,It will continue to be accessible there.,212,,
1266,0.97,9365.723,9367.524,And I think it has been closed off.,212,,
1267,0.97,9367.524,9373.097,So this will really enhance the space a lot.,212,,
1268,0.97,9373.097,9378.235,"If you can slide forward one more slide, I will finish with the last.",212,,
1269,0.97,9378.235,9379.837,One more slide of the Ballard pump station.,212,,
1270,0.97,9379.837,9382.539,The last project here.,212,,
1271,0.97,9382.539,9386.043,We are sharing a street vacation projects that we worked with Seattle city light on.,212,,
1272,0.97,9386.043,9393.25,This is the diagnosed Street vacation.,212,,
1273,0.97,9393.25,9401.058,City light requested to vacate a site of diagonal Avenue on the Self-Service center in Sodo.,212,,
1274,0.97,9401.058,9408.165,This allowed them to enhance the security features of the facility.,212,,
1275,0.97,9408.165,9416.573,"Really for any of the vacations that come in front of the Commission, there are two parts to the review.",212,,
1276,0.97,9416.573,9420.411,First it is the public trust review which includes any issues with vacating the Right- Of-Way.,212,,
1277,0.97,9420.411,9431.588,"And the second portion, if it is approved to actually vacate the Right-Of-Way.",212,,
1278,0.97,9431.588,9432.79,We reviewed the proposed public benefit.,212,,
1279,0.97,9432.79,9442.299,So how is the remaining public ground enhancing the offset the loss of right away?,212,,
1280,0.97,9442.299,9451.408,We reviewed the public trust and life 2020 in the public benefit package in September and unanimously we supported the vacation.,212,,
1281,0.97,9451.408,9456.88,It was a clear case of improving operations on the site.,212,,
1282,0.97,9456.88,9469.159,"When we then reviewed the public benefit package presented by Seattle city light, it was developed to enhance requests by the Georgetown neighborhood to have additional neighborhood open space.",212,,
1283,0.97,9469.159,9485.142,"If you can go to the next slide, we will see that space that is the main element of the transfer . It was named the Flume property between East marginal way and King County airport.",212,,
1284,0.97,9485.142,9497.621,"And so they propose to make this open space along with funding to advance and implement the design that include open space, dog Park, seating, bike and trail connections.",212,,
1285,0.97,9497.621,9501.358,"Soul on this one, city light partnered with Spu and S.D.O.T.",212,,
1286,0.97,9501.358,9508.332,For these amenities and this is something we really appreciate on many of the projects and Multidepartmental efforts can come together too.,212,,
1287,0.97,9508.332,9513.07,And agree to solutions that leverage these resources from the city site.,212,,
