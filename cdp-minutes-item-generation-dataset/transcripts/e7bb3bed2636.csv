Thank you for inviting me to your committee today . You all had a pretty robust discussion a few weeks ago about the resolution in front of you, so I will sort of skip to my comments related toe substitute version . Our offices are in support of the intent both in the Dsa's division Rept division report and the resolution as it was Perentied two weeks ago . We know there are a lot of reasons for the conditions on third that we see today, so the substitute version in front of you clarifies that there are Multie are multiple factors similar to the report itself creating Thes out there . and then like Councir Council member Lewis mentioned, t mentioned, it gets a little technical about what the proposed next steps would be . O would be . so as proposed next steps, we made some Edits really along the lines of doing some additional homework before we would advance this project to going down the design Pathw.",58,,
92,0.97,1025.991,1027.893,Going down the design Pathway.,58,,
93,0.97,1027.893,1151.75,"And so going back to your Committee, you all raise Similr raise similar questions that you would have sort of the future of work, the future of transportation, and who is passing through to downtown Seattle . So before we advance down the design Pathway, this resolution, the substitute version in front of you recommends some additional traffic analysis as the first next step . going back to 2019 N 2019 when the vision report was put together, we were actually going to be going down a similar path of doing some additional traffic analysis and looking at updated trends, E Covid Unfortunately put that all on hold, but it's a sign of progress that we're picking it back up . But we need to go back to the chalk board and do Somel some additional homework here . E here . We also would want to vet the analysis by the scenario in the vision report itself . to do the updated analysis to make sense from the vision of 2019, or do we want to consider more options? We also want to work with the return to work trends and what the future work force needs in downtown and incorporate that into what would eventually become a design concept for the third Ae corridor . and then in sort of in essence in honor of one of our transportation equity Strategis equity strategies too, we Woulde going back to the community Witt community with that updated analysis how that compares to E to the scenarios and the vision report and Vetting and talking to them about those updates as well . So again sort of Largelyl largely technical in nature . the nature . These amendments support the intent and the spirit Thatl that Council member Lewis put forward in front of you, and just gets more details than what those proposed next steps would be . I thank Council member Lewis and all of you for Reengaging in this conversation, and sparking it again . I think it really has a sign of progress looking forward, which I know we would want to do for a few years Nowo now . So with that, I might Needo open it up to Lish or Cal or fo.",58,,

96,0.97,1170.302,1177.442,Who is in the committee . Why don't we go ahead and move on to Lish and Cal.,59,,

99,0.97,1194.393,1263.729,"Thank you . I first want to thank central staff for helping me think through this and answer some questions over the last couple of weeks . Elliott, thank you for being here . I do still have--I think just some sort of basic questions that I'm hoping you can answer . Cley answer . clearly we know mobility and travel kind of to and through downtown is very different now post Covid . I share the concern about sort of lack of joy in the public realm right now . There is a lot of reasons why downtown is looking the way it does . We certainly need to create space that everyone can enjoy and especially the space that's Sae that's safe for folks walking or Biking or taking transit downtown . It would be helpful for me to try to understand the principles that are guiding this . and I would say there are two areas of concern that I ha.",62,,
100,0.97,1263.729,1313.445,"One is cost . Several alternatives are proposed, you, you know, so we have the Existig conditions with the size of the, the sidewalks, several Differens different alternatives that consider expansion of those . BT those . but also things that would require changes, signal timing, intersections, and there's not a lot of information about when or how the request might be coming gin coming given the deficit we're facing . The hard decisions we're going to have to be making not just in this budget cycle, but for the next couple of years . I am a little concerned about that . and frankly also thinking about the fact that we have some Neighbos have some neighborhoods in the city that lack basic amenities.",62,,
101,0.97,1313.445,1364.93,"So I would like to hear a little bit about how you are thinking about or what Princips what principles we should be using to guide decisions about how to invest in that kind of one area of question . The other question is really about inclusion . In reading through E through the longer report and who was involved in the task force, I would be interested to know, you know, the summary and the resolutions, as hundreds of Stakeholders were involved . But given the long history in this area as a Hub for poor people to gather, I'm surprised I don't see organizations that Ae that are representing the Sociae social service providers . given this is a major transit Corrid.",62,,
102,0.97,1364.93,1390.489,"I'm surprised I don't see the os the organizations representing E transit riders . So I'm just--I want to know as we're continuing these conversations, which I do think are important, you know, how downtown Adapts given the future of work . We're interested in learning how down how downtown could be more Incl, more inclusive, how it could be.",62,,
103,0.97,1390.489,1396.294,And also how it could promote Py promote prosperity for everybody not just for downtown property.,62,,
104,0.97,1396.294,1397.028,Not just for downtown property.,62,,
105,0.97,1397.028,1397.763,Not just for downtown property.,62,,

112,0.97,1402.167,1421.62,Not Ju and so the last thing I guess I'll say is I'm also interested to know what kind of Conversats of conversations you're having as it relates to the plan for D a second tunnel through Downtows downtown as we move towards St3O St3 . So those are my questions and concerns about how we moved move forward in this conversation.,62,,
113,0.97,1421.62,1437.369,"Thank you . those are excellent questions that I have some answers to, but I want to turn it first over to Elliott, and then maybe there could be L be technical answers too from Lish and Calvin in terms of the timing of potential report BAC.",63,,
114,0.97,1437.369,1445.01,But I think Elliott kind of Hols the key to many of those Questis those questions because they would go to executive implementation . Why don't you go first?,63,,
115,0.97,1445.01,1458.79,"Yes, happy to and those are t are excellent questions . I wanted to restate sort of the--third Avenue is really the backbone of the transit Networ.",64,,
116,0.97,1458.79,1619.05,"While we all recognize that Imps need to be made to a guiding principle that we would have and why we are supportive of the council member Herbold too, maintaining the transit capacity in that corridor . your questions about how you factor in cost and design changes like curb changes . those are all questions or answers that would come out of further design process and you would talk about that with community . At s with community . at this point in time, I think we would have to go back to do the traffic analysis and figure out given updates to sound transit, and given our own projects in the corridor, the future Expansionw expansion . how many riders need to get through the system because that really will impact what the design looks like and what our options are . At that point then you can kind of talk to the community about Trade-Os about Trade-Offs around cost, what's available, and what we can do in that space . I think having that conversation about third Avenue while the city is also talking to the Communitiet the communities about the updated Seattle transportation plan and the future funding sources, both Federal and local and state, we'll be able to use the updated information and fold it into the larger city conversations . What can we do about resources available? Witt resources available? without that level of information, the sense of where they are at, not just, you know, have a business here, but really the transit riders themselves . But that's inclusive outreach . without the information around and the preferred concept for the Corr, the corridor, it would be hard O hard to have the city wide Conv, wide conversation, which is why we support advancing the Conven the conversation and the work Bd it .

What I would say--and this is just me speculating, and Elliott doesn't have to respond to this . But I would imagine that the amendments my office worked on with the Mayor's office probably reflect their expectations of what is going to be proposed in the MAS budget . I might ask since the final vote on this would be net Tuesday, we would be--we will probably have the information by then to reconcile Council member Mosqueda's questions . BT Mosqueda's questions .
