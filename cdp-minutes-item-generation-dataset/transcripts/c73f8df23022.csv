151,0.97,944.71,966.598,"When I teach about energy and resource management to students, I often include the approaches that indigenous cultures all over the world, and specifically the Pacific Northwest have taken in resource management, and I know that those practices are based on a philosophy of seven generations.",29,,
152,0.97,966.598,977.976,"How will our decisions that we make about resource management impact generations, our grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren.",29,,
153,0.97,977.976,984.149,"And so the integrated resource plan is just looking at 20 years, I realize.",29,,
154,0.97,984.149,985.25,We're a little more shortsighted.,29,,
155,0.97,985.25,986.251,"But still, that's something.",29,,
156,0.97,986.251,996.562,And I don't think we can address an integrated resource plan without considering the need to modernize infrastructure that's archaic.,29,,
157,0.97,996.562,1001.734,Some of that archaic infrastructure is on the lower snake River.,29,,
158,0.97,1001.734,1002.935,The dams there.,29,,
159,0.97,1002.935,1008.407,So I think that we need bold action.,29,,
160,0.97,1008.407,1035.868,"The integrated resource plan should consider strongly that breaching those dams will enable us to modernize and to really create a plan that provides reliable, affordable power with energy that is not negatively as negatively Impacting all of the Stakeholders.",29,,

174,0.97,1120.252,1127.86,The proposed fixed basic charge for all customers is within the appropriate range for a monthly charge.,31,,
175,0.97,1127.86,1136.401,"However, it is important to note that an assessment of utility fixed cost does not equal what the monthly basic service charge should be.",31,,
176,0.97,1136.401,1143.475,There are many fixed costs that should not be included in the basic service charge.,31,,
177,0.97,1143.475,1151.917,Managing customer load is key to helping address Reliability and peak usage in the summer and winter.,31,,
178,0.97,1151.917,1159.858,The proposed optional time of day rates are an important complement to other utility programs to manage customer usage.,31,,
179,0.97,1159.858,1179.278,"And as you're aware, the Irp reflects a significant acquisition plan, and one that Echos the city's commitment to energy efficiency, and customer resources, as well as building out the next generation of renewable energy resources.",31,,
180,0.97,1179.278,1188.52,"As investments in electricity efficiency increase, there should be a proportional increase in delivering low income residential, and multifamily Weatherization programs.",31,,
181,0.97,1188.52,1197.829,And we're very pleased to see the focus on managing customer load using demand response.,31,,
182,0.97,1197.829,1205.304,However these programs need to be expanded as they should go hand in hand with Electrification.,31,,
183,0.97,1205.304,1209.775,"In the next Irp, we want to see wind and solar projects.",31,,
184,0.97,1209.775,1213.879,There are no investments in this proposal.,31,,
185,0.97,1213.879,1223.822,"We appreciate working with city light staff, and continue to be deeply engaged in implementation, and Adaptive management as Technologies evolve, creating new opportunities.",31,,
186,0.97,1223.822,1227.759,Thank you.,31,,
187,0.97,1227.759,1229.595,Thank you very much.,32,,
188,0.97,1229.595,1233.198,"In Athat was our last Speaker, so we'll move onto item one.",32,,
189,0.97,1233.198,1237.369,Will the clerk please read item one into the record?,32,,
190,0.97,1237.369,1239.171,Agenda item one.,33,,
191,0.97,1239.171,1247.379,"Establishment of the Seattle film Commission, briefing and discussion.",33,,
192,0.97,1247.379,1247.713,All right.,34,,
193,0.97,1247.713,1253.218,Seattle's got a reputation as a creative city.,34,,
194,0.97,1253.218,1260.158,And Seattle's also been on the cutting edge of film making.,34,,
195,0.97,1260.158,1267.599,"However, our Creatives are being priced out of town, and we're no longer on the cutting edge.",34,,
196,0.97,1267.599,1285.35,"It's bad enough to see Vancouver in movies and films that are supposed to be about Seattle, and it's even worse to see our Creatives and small businesses move into other cities with more film opportunities like Portland, for example, or Nashville, or Atlanta.",34,,
197,0.97,1285.35,1297.462,So if we want to grow our creative economy focusing on film is the best investment we can make.,34,,
198,0.97,1297.462,1306.338,Artists can make a living making their art in the most diverse and greatest number of creative explains.,34,,
199,0.97,1306.338,1307.739,And I want to pause here.,34,,
200,0.97,1307.739,1310.642,"Okay, so we've got an Infographic up there to make this point.",34,,
201,0.97,1310.642,1323.855,"It is really hard to read, but it shows almost 200 creative jobs that are activated on a single film production.",34,,
202,0.97,1323.855,1328.794,These are typically Union living wage jobs and many don't need a college degree.,34,,
203,0.97,1328.794,1334.166,So focusing on film starts with the establishment of a film Commission.,34,,
204,0.97,1334.166,1334.366,Why?,34,,
205,0.97,1334.366,1342.941,Because an industry of Professionallals will engage with their networks to help the city Prioritize needs.,34,,
206,0.97,1342.941,1358.89,Commissioners will advise the city of development of initiatives that strengthen our initial economy and attract out of state productions that generate living wage jobs and pour money into communities and also showcase Seattle to the rest of the world.,34,,
207,0.97,1358.89,1372.371,"Finally, they'll collaborate are regional Stakeholders and partners to foster alignment with King County, and Washington state on policies and initiatives related to the regional film economy.",34,,
208,0.97,1372.371,1376.007,So obviously this is not my idea.,34,,
209,0.97,1376.007,1383.215,Film industry Stakeholders have been advocating for a film Commission for years.,34,,
210,0.97,1383.215,1386.752,"Spanning many organizations, and the Seattle music Commission was started in 2010.",34,,
211,0.97,1386.752,1398.697,"Just to give you a bit of recent history, in 2019, the music and film committees came together, and announced the Seattle and film Commission to grow music and I film production.",34,,
212,0.97,1398.697,1413.812,"In 2020, they mobilized the office of film and music to create a film task force whose primary goal was the establishment of a film Commission.",34,,
213,0.97,1413.812,1420.152,And counsel Councilmembers Sawant and Herbold were behind that.,34,,
214,0.97,1420.152,1426.691,They were never able to advance their agenda.,34,,
215,0.97,1426.691,1428.593,My campaign focused on economic recovery.,34,,
216,0.97,1428.593,1433.265,"I listened to film Stakeholders, and committed to a film Commission if I got elected.",34,,
217,0.97,1433.265,1443.809,"Once in office, I staked up film as a central component of my work plan and had my first meeting with film Stakeholders on January 28th.",34,,
218,0.97,1443.809,1451.75,"Since then, our office, and thank you, Jeremy, has been working with them and Oed to bring forward this ordinance today.",34,,
219,0.97,1451.75,1462.227,"And it's a draft ordinance, and we will be discussing the formally introduced legislation at our next meeting on September 14th.",34,,
220,0.97,1462.227,1463.228,More on that later.,34,,
221,0.97,1463.228,1471.837,So with that I'll stop talking and let Brian goodnight of Seattle central staff present the specifics in the legislation.,34,,
222,0.97,1471.837,1473.839,"Go ahead, Brian.",34,,
223,0.97,1473.839,1476.441,"Thank you, chair Nelson.",35,,
224,0.97,1476.441,1477.142,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",35,,
225,0.97,1477.142,1478.643,"Brian goodnight, council central staff.",35,,
226,0.97,1478.643,1482.48,I will bring up the presentation right now.,35,,
227,0.97,1482.48,1490.655,"Right off the top this morning, I would just want to let everyone know, I'm pinch hitting for my colleague, Yolanda today.",35,,
228,0.97,1490.655,1493.592,That is working on the bill that the committee is discussing.,35,,
229,0.97,1493.592,1501.933,"With that, I will do my best, and get started to try to accurately summarize the work that's happened so far.",35,,
230,0.97,1501.933,1511.376,"First off, the things that I'll walk through today are just a some brief background notes, and then we'll finish with next steps.",35,,
231,0.97,1511.376,1528.527,"Beginning in 2019, as the city began to reevaluate the role of the office of film and music, or Ofm, which was located in the office of economic development, it convened film industry Stakeholders to provide recommendations for how the city could best support and grow the local organization and Committee.",35,,
232,0.97,1528.527,1536.835,One of the recommendations was to provide a film Commission to provide strategic advice to the city Mayor on initiatives related to the film industry.,35,,
233,0.97,1536.835,1549.08,"As part of the 2020 budget process, the executive proposed to Repurpose Lfn resources to advance the creative strategy.",35,,
234,0.97,1549.08,1560.825,"Additionally, Councilmember Herbold sponsored and the Council adopted 10A2 that requested Oed to provide recommendations regarding a film Commission.",35,,
235,0.97,1560.825,1570.902,"The following year, in November of 2020, Oed submitted a response that provided guidance for the purpose membership of the Commission.",35,,
236,0.97,1570.902,1582.814,"As chair Nelson said, in early 2020, she began engaging film industry Stakeholders and a sense advanced the Commission.",35,,
237,0.97,1582.814,1590.155,"So moving onto the draft legislation, the draft was to collaborate with Oed and film representatives.",35,,
238,0.97,1590.155,1593.158,So it would establish a new film Commission.,35,,
239,0.97,1593.158,1605.136,The Commission's charge would be to advise and make recommendations to the city on the development of policies and programs that enhance the economic development of Seattle's film industry.,35,,
240,0.97,1605.136,1615.347,"This includes promoting the sustained growth, and family wage jobs for worker who is have been under represented in the industry.",35,,
241,0.97,1615.347,1634.899,"The goals are to address disparities in the industry, driving equity, inclusion, and economic prosperity, and to serve as a Conduit between the city, and the community to equity grow the industry as part of the city's economic development priorities in the creative economy.",35,,
242,0.97,1634.899,1653.018,"The Commission will have 11 members, five appointed by the Mayor, five appointed by the sill, with Consill, with the 11th appointed by the Commission.",35,,
243,0.97,1653.018,1656.221,This list shows the Stakeholder groups that must be represented.,35,,
244,0.97,1656.221,1667.032,"And I'll pause just for a moment on this slide, so you can look through the list, but I will not bore you by reading it.",35,,
245,0.97,1667.032,1674.639,The draft legislation also assigns the following purposes to the Commission to engage with industry professionals to inform the development of city efforts.,35,,
246,0.97,1674.639,1686.051,"To advise the city and the development of efforts to support the film industry, and such as strategies for equity, and inclusion, education, and training, and business attraction incentives.",35,,
247,0.97,1686.051,1694.859,And to collaborate with regional Stakeholders to ensure that Seattle's film priorities are in alignment with those in King County and Washington state.,35,,
248,0.97,1694.859,1702.634,"Finally, in terms of process, the draft legislation requires the Commission to meet at least monthly, and to meet annually with the Seattle music Commission.",35,,
249,0.97,1702.634,1708.573,"The Commission must also elect a chair and vice chair annually, and adopt bylaws for its own procedures.",35,,
250,0.97,1708.573,1719.484,"The terms of Commission members are set at three years each, with a maximum of two consecutive terms.",35,,
251,0.97,1719.484,1723.288,"Lastly, they provide compensation, if serving provides a financial hardship.",35,,
252,0.97,1723.288,1731.93,"In terms of next steps, Oed staff and chair Nelson's office, continue to Engauge.",35,,
253,0.97,1731.93,1742.507,"At chair Nelson said, the plan is for the committee to discussion discuss and possibly vote on it on September 14th.",35,,
254,0.97,1742.507,1745.543,They would be able to consider the bill on September 20th.,35,,
255,0.97,1745.543,1749.08,"With that, I'll do my best to answer questions if I can.",35,,
256,0.97,1749.08,1757.422,"If I can't, I'll take them down for Yolanda to provide the answers once she returns to the office.",35,,
257,0.97,1757.422,1757.655,Thanks.,35,,
258,0.97,1757.655,1758.923,Hold please.,36,,
259,0.97,1758.923,1761.793,"Thank you very much, Ryan.",36,,
260,0.97,1761.793,1763.761,I appreciate that.,36,,
261,0.97,1763.761,1764.529,Just a second.,36,,
262,0.97,1764.529,1772.203,"I see your hand, Councilmember, I am simply pulling up my script.",36,,
263,0.97,1772.203,1793.224,"So before I get to your question, I want to thank Oed director Markham McIntyre for this effort, obviously, and Chris Swenson of Oed who has been Seattle's lead on all things film for about a million years.",36,,
264,0.97,1793.224,1797.996,"He helped write this legislation, along with Melissa Purcell.",36,,
265,0.97,1797.996,1800.665,"Kate Becker, and Amy Lillard of Washington Filmworks.",36,,
266,0.97,1800.665,1809.44,"With that, I will turn to Councilmember Herbold for questions, or comments.",36,,
267,0.97,1809.44,1814.012,Thanks so much.,37,,
268,0.97,1814.012,1817.816,And my sincere thanks Councilmember Nelson for bringing this forward.,37,,
269,0.97,1817.816,1845.143,"The previous administration, the difficulty of establishing a film Commission was linked to the mission of the new administration as implemented by the office of economic development to really look at the creative industries, as sort of under a single umbrella, rather than recognizing that some of our creative Industries merit a specific focus.",37,,
270,0.97,1845.143,1856.321,And so I have two questions sort of related to how things have Pivoted to the current administration.,37,,
271,0.97,1856.321,1861.826,"One, I didn't see anything in the presentation though, I'm sure it's covered in the draft bill.",37,,
272,0.97,1861.826,1864.863,I just haven't found it yet.,37,,
273,0.97,1864.863,1873.805,"What are the appointing authorities, and how many of the Appointive authorities, how many commissioners are appointed by each?",37,,
274,0.97,1873.805,1875.573,"It's five and five, and one.",38,,
275,0.97,1875.573,1880.945,"So five by the Mayor, five by the Council.",38,,
276,0.97,1880.945,1897.929,"One by the Commission as a whole, and all confirmed Consill, and the by the Council and position and terms.",38,,
277,0.97,1897.929,1901.366,The Mayor has authority to appoint five.,39,,
278,0.97,1901.366,1912.343,That's a pretty good Signifier that we have buy in with this administration.,39,,
279,0.97,1912.343,1913.811,"Yes, absolutely.",40,,
280,0.97,1913.811,1917.582,"Right along here, and with director McIntyre.",40,,
281,0.97,1917.582,1921.786,Yes.,40,,
282,0.97,1921.786,1922.086,Is that it?,40,,
283,0.97,1922.086,1925.023,That's my question.,41,,
284,0.97,1925.023,1930.061,Thank you very much for that historical background.,42,,
285,0.97,1930.061,1938.803,I think that there's a a lot of energy behind seeing new things come forward.,42,,
286,0.97,1938.803,1940.438,Are there any questions from my colleagues?,42,,
287,0.97,1940.438,1944.742,All right.,42,,
288,0.97,1944.742,1945.31,This is just the beginning.,42,,
289,0.97,1945.31,1958.523,"I just want to thank everyone for your work on this today, and just leave you with some important points.",42,,
290,0.97,1958.523,1959.357,This is about equity.,42,,
291,0.97,1959.357,1963.261,"And it's about economic growth, and workforce development.",42,,
292,0.97,1963.261,1969.334,It's about creating jobs and opportunities to build wealth and livelihoods.,42,,
293,0.97,1969.334,1977.475,"It's about art, and innovation, and commercial success, and tourism, and pride of place.",42,,
294,0.97,1977.475,1982.68,So we've got all the assets here in Seattle.,42,,
295,0.97,1982.68,1983.014,We really do.,42,,
296,0.97,1983.014,1993.124,"And so, not only do we have the talent, and the passion for film.",42,,
297,0.97,1993.124,1997.228,We've got Sif and other rich Nonprofits.,42,,
298,0.97,1997.228,2009.307,"We've got ethnic diversity, and very, very strong partners, and partnerships with labor, and we've got stunning physical beauty, and so we've got all of that, and it's government's job to say yes.",42,,
299,0.97,2009.307,2009.807,It really is.,42,,
300,0.97,2009.807,2019.851,"It's government's job to say yes, and put some intention behind, getting Seattle's edge back as the best city in the country for film making.",42,,
301,0.97,2019.851,2023.855,So that's what the film Commission is about.,42,,
302,0.97,2023.855,2031.896,"That's the road we're on right now, and I'm excited that we're taking our first steps.",42,,
303,0.97,2031.896,2034.332,"So thank you very much, everyone.",42,,
304,0.97,2034.332,2045.91,"All right, reminder, September 14th is our next discussion and hopefully a vote out of committee with a vote in full Council, I believe, on the 20th.",42,,
305,0.97,2045.91,2049.28,I could have my dates wrong.,42,,
306,0.97,2049.28,2049.814,The following Tuesday.,42,,

312,0.97,2065.93,2066.197,Okay.,44,,
313,0.97,2066.197,2076.007,"So while the momentum on film and the city of Seattle has slowed a bit, King County is charging ahead.",44,,
314,0.97,2076.007,2088.352,"And in Olympia, Washington Filmworks was a driving force behind getting the Legislature to allocate $12 million annually to film incentives statewide, and that's up from 3 million.",44,,
315,0.97,2088.352,2095.66,So we've got to align our efforts into what's going on at the county and state.,44,,
316,0.97,2095.66,2111.108,"And so director McIntyre will present the city strategies on film, and Ms. Becker will, with the office of the King County executive, will take about exciting new developments that will boost film in the region, and in Seattle.",44,,
317,0.97,2111.108,2113.377,Mostly thanks to her.,44,,

320,0.97,2128.893,2131.429,"After that, I will ask for questions.",44,,
321,0.97,2131.429,2137.301,"But for right now, take it away.",44,,
322,0.97,2137.301,2138.469,"Thanks, Councilmember.",45,,

326,0.97,2151.148,2152.416,"So next slide, please.",45,,
327,0.97,2152.416,2156.22,We're just going to give kind of an overview of current film support.,45,,
328,0.97,2156.22,2172.904,"Talk about some of these new economic opportunities which is really kind of one of the driving forces behind establishing the film Commission, as well as O were different's work with our partners to kind of lean in on film right now, because there's a clear economic opportunity here.",45,,
329,0.97,2172.904,2183.548,"Continue to discuss government alignment opportunities, and then close with an overview of some of the near and long term priorities for Oed, the film Tri.",45,,
330,0.97,2183.548,2183.981,Industry.,45,,
331,0.97,2183.981,2185.883,So next slide please.,45,,
332,0.97,2185.883,2188.052,Just to Recap of Oed.,45,,
333,0.97,2188.052,2198.663,Our mission is to build an Inclues inclusive committee.,45,,
334,0.97,2198.663,2207.939,We find this inclusive economy as a combination of business wealth and community wealth.,45,,

336,0.97,2216.414,2217.515,What does that mean?,45,,
337,0.97,2217.515,2232.897,"That means listening to, and collaborating with our business providers, Partnering with business developments, and making sure there is alignment there.",45,,
338,0.97,2232.897,2238.035,Prioritizing innovative approaches to wealth building opportunities for all residents.,45,,
339,0.97,2238.035,2247.278,"So once again, that's an Encapps lags Incapps lags.",45,,
340,0.97,2247.278,2257.822,"In the 2019 study that Oed, and arts and culture office put together, the definition was jobs and creative skills that use creative skills across all industries.",45,,
341,0.97,2257.822,2266.464,This was brought up a little earlier in the film Commission introduction.,45,,
342,0.97,2266.464,2271.369,But that's really broad.,45,,
343,0.97,2271.369,2273.938,It includes 61 different occupations.,45,,
344,0.97,2273.938,2282.38,"Camera operators for TV, and film.",45,,
345,0.97,2282.38,2283.714,Pr communications professionals.,45,,
346,0.97,2283.714,2286.717,"An actor, musician, Audio engineer, social media content Creator, so it's broad.",45,,
347,0.97,2286.717,2295.726,"Yet to be really Affective, we also need to pick and choose where we find developers that can have that maximum impact.",45,,
348,0.97,2295.726,2299.063,That's why we're talking about film today.,45,,
349,0.97,2299.063,2301.132,That's why we're establishing this Commission.,45,,
350,0.97,2301.132,2306.404,"As Councilmember Nelson mentioned, the state and the county are already moving forward with different assets.",45,,
351,0.97,2306.404,2312.009,"So the Washington state's increased the film incentive, King County has the new harbor Island studios.",45,,
352,0.97,2312.009,2328.492,These are all new opportunities that we can take advantage of to grow our creative economy as a whole and the film industry.,45,,
353,0.97,2328.492,2336.767,"We have a long standing relationship with the county and the state, so this isn't like something that is brand new.",45,,
354,0.97,2336.767,2349.28,What we're trying to do is to figure out how we can have our actions and dollars in an effective way.,45,,
355,0.97,2349.28,2353.117,This is kind of like a key moment in time.,45,,
356,0.97,2353.117,2357.455,"If we don't lean our shoulder into it, we're going to Miss out.",45,,
357,0.97,2357.455,2369.533,"This is a national competition for these film productions and the opportunity is right now, so we've got to seize it, grasp it, work with our business owners and workers to figure out how to take advantage of it.",45,,
358,0.97,2369.533,2383.814,"With that, I'm really excited to turn it over to my two Codirector it's, Julie Daman is going to go next, then we'll hear from Kate Becker, who is the director of King County creative economy.",45,,

367,0.97,2397.428,2399.363,Thank you for this time.,50,,
368,0.97,2399.363,2402.166,Thank you committee members and director McIntyre.,50,,
369,0.97,2402.166,2415.946,"I'm the director of finance with Washington Filmworks, which is actually, we can go to the next slide.",50,,
370,0.97,2415.946,2419.183,We are the Legislatively commissioned nonprofit.,50,,
371,0.97,2419.183,2421.051,That is what is formally our incentive program.,50,,
372,0.97,2421.051,2425.055,We also provide the functions of the state film office.,50,,
373,0.97,2425.055,2433.697,So we're the first point of contact for all times of film projects of all types and sizes.,50,,
374,0.97,2433.697,2444.608,"Really, the incentive is the best tool we have to attract and win those larger projects that mean real economic development for the state.",50,,
375,0.97,2444.608,2445.409,"Next slide, please.",50,,
376,0.97,2445.409,2450.548,"So the mission at Washington Filmworks is to build a sustainable, and competitive film industry in Washington state.",50,,
377,0.97,2450.548,2455.186,We know that key to that is going to be a film Ecosystem.,50,,
378,0.97,2455.186,2465.229,"So we're thrilled with this new legislation that we are able to invest in that talent pipeline through career connected learning, and business development.",50,,
379,0.97,2465.229,2484.849,"So that means that we have the cast, crew, and support systems with the skills and capacities needed to, so they have the skills and capacities needed to meet that new level of film making that the incentive will bring.",50,,
380,0.97,2484.849,2485.382,"Next slide, please.",50,,
381,0.97,2485.382,2487.551,So what does this new incentive look like?,50,,
382,0.97,2487.551,2496.327,"For the past 15 years, as you mentioned, it looked a lot like $3.5 million.",50,,
383,0.97,2496.327,2499.263,"It is actually now increased to $15 million, not 12.",50,,
384,0.97,2499.263,2499.897,So we're thrilled about that.,50,,
385,0.97,2499.897,2503.067,The governor signed that into law in April.,50,,
386,0.97,2503.067,2516.347,"In this legislation, there was also an allowance for a 10% Inhansment, and 20% goal to encourage filming in rural communities and helped tell the stories of those from historically Underrepresented groups.",50,,
387,0.97,2516.347,2523.954,I think part of it that is often overlooked is that it also extended our sunset date to 2030.,50,,
388,0.97,2523.954,2531.061,With the increased cap means more money for longer to help bring in those projects.,50,,
389,0.97,2531.061,2531.495,"Next slide, please.",50,,
390,0.97,2531.495,2536.233,So another program that is new to this legislation is for small budget productions.,50,,
391,0.97,2536.233,2542.673,"This program is near and dear to my heart, because it is about investing in the next generation.",50,,
392,0.97,2542.673,2554.418,"It's finding our next Lynn Sheltons, and our next Megan grief Griffith it's.",50,,
393,0.97,2554.418,2560.391,It's about helping make that first picture or leveling up.,50,,
394,0.97,2560.391,2569.5,We can allocate up to $3 million annually for budgets with less than $1 million that are creatively driven by Washington residents.,50,,
395,0.97,2569.5,2574.872,That means keeping the talent pool local and Incentivizing the Filmmakers to stay in Washington Tate.,50,,
396,0.97,2574.872,2577.508,The cool part is we get to be first money in.,50,,
397,0.97,2577.508,2584.114,"In the standard program, when projects apply for finding assistance, they have to be fully funded and ready to go.",50,,
398,0.97,2584.114,2585.916,"In this program, they don't.",50,,
399,0.97,2585.916,2595.726,"So we can help support these projects as they're developing, and make sure that they're the best that they can possibly be.",50,,
400,0.97,2595.726,2596.527,"Next slide, please.",50,,
401,0.97,2596.527,2597.594,Workforce development.,50,,
402,0.97,2597.594,2599.53,It's been mentioned a lot today.,50,,
403,0.97,2599.53,2603.601,And we are very excited about this new provision.,50,,
404,0.97,2603.601,2620.317,"So last year in 2021, we piloted a program called the media Mentorship program, which was aimed at making statewide SETS more diverse and equitable.",50,,
405,0.97,2620.317,2623.253,Who wanted to partnership in a Pa program.,50,,
406,0.97,2623.253,2631.028,"We matched them with Union mentors, and eventually they were hired onto incentive sets.",50,,
407,0.97,2631.028,2635.733,"We're thrilled that in this legislation, we were given the authority to expand our program.",50,,
408,0.97,2635.733,2640.137,"Not only that, we are mandated to put real dollars behind it.",50,,
409,0.97,2640.137,2644.508,"$500,000 each year, and over the next few years.",50,,
410,0.97,2644.508,2657.554,"And $750,000 every year until the program sun SETS 0 make sure that we're doing workforce development and focusing on those from under represented communities.",50,,
411,0.97,2657.554,2658.022,"Next slide, please.",50,,
412,0.97,2658.022,2660.491,So what is possible?,50,,
413,0.97,2660.491,2664.762,"I've outlined what the increased $50 million, and what some of these programs are.",50,,
414,0.97,2664.762,2666.864,Numbers are kind of my jam.,50,,
415,0.97,2666.864,2667.731,So I did some projections.,50,,
416,0.97,2667.731,2673.303,This was really just meant to give you an idea of the shift in scope.,50,,
417,0.97,2673.303,2678.942,"This is nothing I'm going to say is definitely going to happen, but it's a possibility.",50,,
418,0.97,2678.942,2687.985,"Under the old program with $3.5 million, we were able to commit funds to probably 3 to 4 films.",50,,
419,0.97,2687.985,2691.588,We're looking at an increase of 10 projects.,50,,
420,0.97,2691.588,2703.467,"We might be able to attract three episodic series, those are those longer term projects that have multiple episodes, hopefully multiple seasons.",50,,
421,0.97,2703.467,2717.548,"We'll still be able to support those four feature films and also invest in those three small budget productions, which is really about investing in the next generation.",50,,
422,0.97,2717.548,2719.183,"Next slide, please.",50,,
423,0.97,2719.183,2720.384,So it's all very exciting.,50,,
424,0.97,2720.384,2726.457,"And we are absolutely thrilled that we get to do all of this fun stuff, but we can't do it alone.",50,,
425,0.97,2726.457,2737.835,"We're going to need the partnership of all of our statewide partners and the city of Seattle is the largest, most recognizable production center in the state.",50,,
426,0.97,2737.835,2741.705,"It was already mentioned, when people think of Washington, they think of Seattle first.",50,,
427,0.97,2741.705,2756.286,"We are so excited that, you know, we've had this great relationship with the city in the past, whether that has been working on the Commercialized Seattle campaign, taking trips to L.A.",50,,
428,0.97,2756.286,2775.906,"For marketing purposes, touring around perspective Filmmakers, so we are really looking forward to growing our long standing relationship, and I'm outlining the Pathway for the city to continue their economic development through Filmworks.",50,,
429,0.97,2775.906,2782.646,First is to partner with us on the strategies as they Unrule.,50,,
430,0.97,2782.646,2795.659,"Secondly, having a well staffed and Resourced film office that cannot only continue to meet current needs, but also as the incentive brings more projects, meet that increased demand as well.",50,,
431,0.97,2795.659,2799.263,"The film industry is notoriously fast paced, and seemingly last minute.",50,,
432,0.97,2799.263,2814.378,"So making sure there is a streamlined permitting process, so that there is someone who understands the language of film, and can translate that into city speak is going to be exceedingly important.",50,,
433,0.97,2814.378,2843.607,"Finally, having partnership on this workforce development to better serve the individuals from historically Underrested groups is going to be important, because building a film industry that is reflective of not only, you know reflecting of our community is not only good economic development, but allows those individuals to tell stories about our communities, and share those stories nationally and internationally, and build on this reputation that the city of Seattle, and Washington state has for authenticity, and creativity.",50,,
434,0.97,2843.607,2844.641,Thank you very much.,50,,
435,0.97,2844.641,2847.544,I will stick around for questions at the end.,50,,
436,0.97,2847.544,2855.919,"But I believe I'm going to hand it back to director McIntyre, right now.",50,,
437,0.97,2855.919,2856.72,"Thanks, great presentation.",51,,
438,0.97,2856.72,2870.667,"Really appreciate the clarity of what the film incentive can do in terms of projects that it brings to the state, and hopefully to Seattle, as well as these, the support that you're looking for from the city and how that Aligns.",51,,
439,0.97,2870.667,2875.739,"With that, I'm very pleased to turn it over to Kate Becker from the time perspective.",51,,
440,0.97,2875.739,2888.051,"Thank you very much, I'm delighted to be back at this table in Council chambers, it's been a while.",52,,
441,0.97,2888.051,2892.222,"First, before we get started, can we switch to the next slide?",52,,
442,0.97,2892.222,2905.269,"Thank you for Championing this, it's really an Incleansable stand increase.",52,,
443,0.97,2905.269,2910.374,We are moving film in the positive direction we seem to be moving now.,52,,
444,0.97,2910.374,2911.942,So this is very tremendous.,52,,
445,0.97,2911.942,2912.376,Thank you for this.,52,,
446,0.97,2912.376,2928.125,"I had the honor of serving as the director of the music career here from 2014 to 2019, and moved to director Konstantin, who really wanted to see us expand this work at the regional level.",52,,
447,0.97,2928.125,2933.964,That's what we've been working on since then.,52,,
448,0.97,2933.964,2946.009,"In 2019, September, the executive issued an executive order, Prioritizing film throughout King County.",52,,

450,0.97,2947.611,2948.912,And Prioritizing for film production.,52,,
451,0.97,2948.912,2969.499,"We established an executive film advisory board that consists of 15 people, including Melissa Purrsell, who is with us here today, and they advise us regularly on the King County film Initialtive, and on one of our biggest investments, which is harbor Island studios.",52,,
452,0.97,2969.499,2980.11,"We did invest $3 million in activating a 117,000 square footwear house on harbor Island in the city of Seattle.",52,,
453,0.97,2980.11,2984.748,We have had two big pilot projects in there since we have opened the pilot project doors.,52,,
454,0.97,2984.748,2997.461,"And put several hundred people back to work during the pandemic with three busy season two, and Loveline season four.",52,,

456,0.97,3001.665,3009.806,I also want to mention that Seattle and King County have worked together on a film.,52,,
457,0.97,3009.806,3010.774,Ecosystems study.,52,,
458,0.97,3010.774,3027.424,"That, while we have not released it yet, because the pandemic hit, and altered the state of the film industry dramatically, we have most of the work done, and just need a baseline refresh to get that system study out the door.",52,,
459,0.97,3027.424,3028.158,"Next slide, please.",52,,
460,0.97,3028.158,3037.968,"I did mention this, we have eased the process and made it much easier for film professionals to get films quickly and Affordably.",52,,
461,0.97,3037.968,3046.376,"We heard from location scouts and managers that this was an ongoing issue, so it was something that we addressed right away.",52,,

465,0.97,3056.586,3077.441,"We've long had strong partnerships and hope to continue that, of course, update the film system study for the region, and continued access to city owned parking lot, which is near harbor owned studios, which is really key to big projections working.",52,,
466,0.97,3077.441,3077.974,"So next slide, please.",52,,
467,0.97,3077.974,3090.72,"Before we close, I just want to say that this is an Incredity exciting moment, I want to thank all the advocates, and activists and political leaders who have stepped forward to make this happen.",52,,
468,0.97,3090.72,3108.071,"There is so much opportunity at hand now to really grow a competitive and equitable film industry here in this region, and King County, the Economictive, the team and I, we all stand at the ready to partner with the city as we move forward on this work.",52,,

473,0.97,3127.624,3139.102,"I want to talk more tactually about what it means, how meaningful the Department was with the city, and I want to talk a little more about what that means in practice.",53,,
474,0.97,3139.102,3142.205,Both Kate and Julie talked about permitting.,53,,
475,0.97,3142.205,3145.775,I'm someone who believes that permitting could always be improved.,53,,
476,0.97,3145.775,3156.553,"We're certainly going to work on that, over with our film team, and work with the other departments.",53,,
477,0.97,3156.553,3162.058,"We want to make sure that permitting is as easy, and straight forward as possible.",53,,
478,0.97,3162.058,3165.328,"Secondly, we want to continue align with the state.",53,,
479,0.97,3165.328,3184.948,"I think having this film Commission, the county has their body and making sure that we're working very close together, in terms of who are the people being represented, the difference voices being represented, but also trying to synthesize to an actionable set of priorities, so we can make progress, and not just create laundry lists.",53,,
480,0.97,3184.948,3205.869,"I think is going to be a key thing about that Alignmentment we want to launch a film Seattle brand, as both Kate and Julie mentioned, when you think of Washington state film, Seattle is kind of the top of the list in terms of the Iconic brand for where to film.",53,,
481,0.97,3205.869,3207.871,We've got Iconic land escape.,53,,
482,0.97,3207.871,3211.875,"Mountains, water, all kinds of locations within an hour or a half hour away.",53,,
483,0.97,3211.875,3220.617,"So we want to make sure when looking for where to shoot, it's really easy to find us, and makes them want to come to be here.",53,,
484,0.97,3220.617,3227.257,We're going to launch this film Seattle brand that's going to include work with our business districts.,53,,
485,0.97,3227.257,3238.501,"Connecting with the state stories from Underserved communities that Julia mentioned, how we bring in, and attract film productions to Seattle.",53,,
486,0.97,3238.501,3260.557,"Finally, it's establishing this film Commission and making sure that Oed and our staff do an excellent job of staffing it, and again trying to do those things, which is advising us on the programs, engaging with the industry, and the Stakeholders to figure out what are those economic opportunities that we can take advantage of.",53,,
487,0.97,3260.557,3269.232,"We've got our work plan, I think is pretty well stated kind of out of the gate.",53,,
488,0.97,3269.232,3273.703,"But over time, Synthesizing them, and making sure they're in lock step with the county will be plenty important.",53,,
489,0.97,3273.703,3283.446,"We've got plenty of work ahead of us, but I think it's pretty clear what we need to do to take advantage of the opportunity, and we're really excited to go to work.",53,,
490,0.97,3283.446,3289.386,"With that, now you can get to the last slide for questions.",53,,
491,0.97,3289.386,3289.719,Excellent.,54,,
492,0.97,3289.719,3301.031,"I just have to say, I am, I feel really lucky to be stepping in at a time, where the stars seem to be Aligning, and I'm pretty much convening here.",54,,
493,0.97,3301.031,3312.208,Thank you very much for everything you all are doing.,54,,
494,0.97,3312.208,3315.045,"Julie, are we talking about 15 million total?",54,,
495,0.97,3315.045,3321.851,So it is new money on top of 3.5?,54,,
496,0.97,3321.851,3329.659,"Sure, so it's 11.5 more on top of the 3.5, totaling $15 million annually that we can commit.",55,,
497,0.97,3329.659,3329.959,Got it.,56,,
498,0.97,3329.959,3337.267,"I had the total right, but the parts wrong.",56,,
499,0.97,3337.267,3338.735,"Okay, Councilmember Herbold.",56,,
500,0.97,3338.735,3340.103,Thank you so much.,57,,
501,0.97,3340.103,3372.802,"Harkening back to a study that the office of economic development, office of film, and music and the office of arts and culture did in 2019, recognizing, of course, the leadership of the former director, Kate Becker here with us today, that report noted that Seattle's creative economy is strong with about 75,000 creative jobs here in Seattle and above average growth compared to other economic sectors.",57,,
502,0.97,3372.802,3394.524,"That's one of the reasons why I've been such an advocate with you, director making sure that the creative sector is identified as a sector that is a prime sector for the city to invest in.",57,,
503,0.97,3394.524,3403.6,"The report, in addition, noted that a median hourly wage for creative occupations was almost $31 an hour.",57,,
504,0.97,3403.6,3409.405,And creative Industries contributed to 18% of our gross regional product.,57,,
505,0.97,3409.405,3415.011,Compare that to 4% in other jurisdictions across the country.,57,,
506,0.97,3415.011,3420.683,But the report showed there were disparities along race and gender lines.,57,,
507,0.97,3420.683,3424.521,Specifically computer-related occupations had the highest earning.,57,,
508,0.97,3424.521,3431.995,"Arts, design, entertainment, and media occupations had the lowest earnings.",57,,
509,0.97,3431.995,3441.938,"Of course this speaks to the need to invest in skills, workforce development programs to prepare young people and understand the barriers to entry.",57,,
510,0.97,3441.938,3454.184,I really appreciate that the new film Commission has right in its charter the fact that it's going to be centering its efforts Andresing racial disparities within the local film industry.,57,,
511,0.97,3454.184,3479.943,"I further appreciate hearing how the film incentive bill makes a modest investment in addressing these goals and that Filmworks is identified as a partner in addressing these goals, but I'm wondering if you, director Markham can speak to a little more about what your vision is, to how we can partner to address these goals.",57,,
512,0.97,3479.943,3494.657,"Before you start, you mentioned",58,,
513,0.97,3498.361,3499.028,Appreciate the question.,59,,
514,0.97,3499.028,3502.999,That really is the heart of what we're trying to do with economic development.,59,,
515,0.97,3502.999,3510.94,"As we mentioned, the new focus on Oed is how do we break down barriers for people who haven't been included in the economy.",59,,
516,0.97,3510.94,3516.713,Or only been included at the lower Rungs.,59,,
517,0.97,3516.713,3522.051,"I think as all three of us talk the about, workforce is going to be huge.",59,,
518,0.97,3522.051,3526.456,We're here in this where we have been generating lots of jobs.,59,,
519,0.97,3526.456,3529.592,"Unfortunately, we have Beenim Porting a lot of talent.",59,,
520,0.97,3529.592,3531.261,Trying to get local people into the jobs.,59,,
521,0.97,3531.261,3537.166,And a big part of that is our regional workforce development system has been fragmented over decades.,59,,
522,0.97,3537.166,3546.543,"So we really need to make sure, just like we're doing alignment on this specific film project, on all sorts of industries, we need to have strong regional alignment.",59,,
523,0.97,3546.543,3547.71,It is a team sport.,59,,
524,0.97,3547.71,3552.982,"And Seattle trying to do it alone and build its programs, just isn't going to work.",59,,
525,0.97,3552.982,3564.327,We have to figure out how to partner to have a real systematic approach and try to bring in the state and follow dollars.,59,,
526,0.97,3564.327,3571.834,That's really how we're going to build a system that gives people access to those opportunities but also trains them for those opportunities.,59,,
527,0.97,3571.834,3577.807,"We're hearing from a lot of different directors, not just film, that they're really looking for new talent.",59,,
528,0.97,3577.807,3579.909,"And so again, there's a clear opportunity there.",59,,
529,0.97,3579.909,3584.447,It's really about how do we get organized to take advantage of it?,59,,
530,0.97,3584.447,3586.249,Second is more on the business side.,59,,
531,0.97,3586.249,3591.788,So we need to do a better job within the creative industries.,59,,
532,0.97,3591.788,3594.223,"So film, Nightlife, music and special events.",59,,
533,0.97,3594.223,3599.262,"How are we helping businesses owned by women, by people of color?",59,,
534,0.97,3599.262,3602.765,How are we helping them grow as businesses?,59,,
535,0.97,3602.765,3605.635,What kind of technical services are we giving them?,59,,
536,0.97,3605.635,3610.039,How we are we connecting them to access to capital.,59,,
537,0.97,3610.039,3612.909,There are a variety of things we can do.,59,,
538,0.97,3612.909,3617.18,Hopefully Creatin more jobs to thank into our development work force system.,59,,
539,0.97,3617.18,3628.958,"It's REL kind of, I see it as both supporting the development of workers that exist within those four creative industries, but across a much broader construct of creative skill jobs.",59,,
540,0.97,3628.958,3637.667,"And also supporting those businesses within those specific creative industries to strengthen and grow, Tackily for women and people of material.",59,,
541,0.97,3637.667,3639.268,Does that help answer your question?,59,,
542,0.97,3639.268,3644.407,It does.,60,,
543,0.97,3644.407,3650.613,"Look forward to learning more as I think that first comb Ponent, which is really about partnerships.",60,,
544,0.97,3650.613,3652.615,Excited to learn what is going to come out of those conversations.,60,,
545,0.97,3652.615,3653.65,We will be back.,61,,
546,0.97,3653.65,3655.485,We have a lot cooking and working for us.,61,,

590,0.97,3915.711,3921.884,And we learned that this plan was generally similar to past Irps.,68,,

626,0.97,4125.02,4125.921,Thank you.,81,,
627,0.97,4125.921,4131.927,I have a question about the plans for a new utility scale resources.,81,,
628,0.97,4131.927,4148.277,"I understand the integrated resource plan includes customer resources like efficiency, response technology and rooftop solar panels am but this question is specifically about the plan for new utility scale resources.",81,,
629,0.97,4148.277,4157.586,The city light light plan to build our own new solar generators?,81,,
630,0.97,4157.586,4160.623,Or contract with private for power companies.,81,,
631,0.97,4160.623,4166.996,"For the last century, people have benefited from inexpensive and climate precisely.",81,,
632,0.97,4166.996,4170.733,Because we have a public utility that owns and operates.,81,,
633,0.97,4170.733,4173.235,Its own Uresources.,81,,
634,0.97,4173.235,4179.775,Working class people can organize to make demands.,81,,
635,0.97,4179.775,4193.622,Utility discount program which my office when it was heading the enrollment.,81,,
636,0.97,4193.622,4205.034,"It makes a difference for the public to have the same, the no guarantee.",81,,
637,0.97,4205.034,4209.772,"But no space for Democratic oversight at all, as there is with public utilities.",81,,
638,0.97,4209.772,4221.383,Parts of the country that have relied on private energy have seen price gouging.,81,,
639,0.97,4221.383,4231.293,"Because they are primarily interested in making profit, not providing power.",81,,
640,0.97,4231.293,4232.962,And will go to ruthless lengths to do that.,81,,
641,0.97,4232.962,4235.431,We've seen that happen.,81,,
642,0.97,4235.431,4242.104,This is the fourth year of new power generation.,81,,
643,0.97,4242.104,4256.852,It would mean that city light was then starting to Incrementally depend on the private market.,81,,
644,0.97,4256.852,4260.556,These many times over the years I have been on city council.,81,,
645,0.97,4260.556,4262.024,Especially energy committee.,81,,
646,0.97,4262.024,4269.932,"But you know, this is the most Concretely-Posed that I've seen this question of all that time.",81,,
647,0.97,4269.932,4272.401,And I know that it won't happen all at once.,81,,
648,0.97,4272.401,4277.406,But it will be a step towards privatization that I would not support.,81,,
649,0.97,4277.406,4284.146,"Just to be clear, I do not object to contracts with other Publicly-Own the utilities.",81,,
650,0.97,4284.146,4289.251,"The contract with Bonneville, a public Electrico Hydroplant is part of the new deal.",81,,
651,0.97,4289.251,4294.289,And it's a good reminder we need a new deal.,81,,
652,0.97,4294.289,4301.53,"My suggestion would be to contract with private, For- profit for power.",81,,
653,0.97,4301.53,4303.499,Can you shed some light on that.,81,,
654,0.97,4303.499,4305.434,I can help with that.,82,,
655,0.97,4305.434,4317.913,"The plan, and as we discussed last time, we do expect or intend to require new resources as new as 2026.",82,,
656,0.97,4317.913,4320.916,And driven by a new load.,82,,
657,0.97,4320.916,4321.283,It's exciting.,82,,
658,0.97,4321.283,4324.82,But also does put pressure on our resources.,82,,
659,0.97,4324.82,4328.624,"And at that point, our plan would be to enter a purchase power agreement.",82,,
660,0.97,4328.624,4340.836,I don't think we have a specific talk specifically about whether we would contract with For-Profit Entilities or not.,82,,
661,0.97,4340.836,4345.941,But likely they would be what is called emergent plants.,82,,
662,0.97,4345.941,4351.28,And looking for purchase power agreements to help firm up what they'll do with the resource.,82,,
663,0.97,4351.28,4352.848,In response to your question.,82,,
664,0.97,4352.848,4355.851,Let me just add one more thing.,82,,
665,0.97,4355.851,4368.363,I'd love nothing more than to be the general manager that was part of Seattle acquiring so a new resource.,82,,
666,0.97,4368.363,4381.677,In order to deliver the lowest possible wage to our customer base as we have been growing.,82,,
667,0.97,4381.677,4382.244,In terms of connection.,82,,
668,0.97,4382.244,4385.28,But we have been better than that.,82,,
669,0.97,4385.28,4393.989,In no small part by leaning into long-term debt financing and have set rates.,82,,
670,0.97,4393.989,4406.869,Looking at debt service coverage as the overriding metric to determine whether how we move our strategic plan and financial plan forward as a result of that.,82,,
671,0.97,4406.869,4410.172,We don't have significant borrowing capacity available to us.,82,,
672,0.97,4410.172,4415.344,In order to enter into a purchase for our own resource or to develop our own resource.,82,,
673,0.97,4415.344,4428.29,"And that is particularly true right now, as we look ahead to the potential for very--for some very expensive investment in our Scad row hydroelectric projects.",82,,
674,0.97,4428.29,4440.469,"One of the things we're doing is trying to move that service up, which means borrowing less and rate funding more in our ongoing Apital, so we can make room.",82,,
675,0.97,4440.469,4443.138,But where we could look at purchasing our own resource.,82,,
676,0.97,4443.138,4445.707,We certainly would love to partner with other Publics.,82,,
677,0.97,4445.707,4450.846,"And in fact, we talked regularly with Snohomish, with Tacoma.",82,,
678,0.97,4450.846,4453.916,And we think about whether there are opportunities to partner or come together.,82,,
679,0.97,4453.916,4457.453,So that is certainly not off the table.,82,,
680,0.97,4457.453,4461.657,And is something we will continue to talk about.,82,,
681,0.97,4461.657,4464.593,Thank you.,83,,
682,0.97,4464.593,4465.561,Follow-up question?,83,,
683,0.97,4465.561,4469.832,Or shall I go to Councilmember Herbold?,83,,
684,0.97,4469.832,4471.934,I don't have follow-up questions.,84,,
685,0.97,4471.934,4473.101,I appreciate that information.,84,,
686,0.97,4473.101,4474.169,But Yeah.,84,,
687,0.97,4474.169,4484.046,"I just want to let you know, I'll be abstaining on this for now.",84,,
688,0.97,4484.046,4484.546,Okay.,85,,
689,0.97,4484.546,4484.847,Thank you.,85,,
690,0.97,4484.847,4485.347,Councilmember Herbold?,85,,
691,0.97,4485.347,4492.788,I'm not sure if I'm asking the same question as Councilmember Sawant asked or if I'm asking a different question.,86,,
692,0.97,4492.788,4494.857,I think it's a slightly different question.,86,,
693,0.97,4494.857,4501.83,"It came up in public comment, which relates to the lack of storage investments in this plan for wind and solar.",86,,
694,0.97,4501.83,4503.866,Could you speak to that?,86,,
695,0.97,4503.866,4504.299,Yeah.,87,,
696,0.97,4504.299,4507.97,Nothing currently is in the mix.,87,,
697,0.97,4507.97,4508.537,It wasn't cost effective.,87,,
698,0.97,4508.537,4512.875,We did look at it to supplement the wind and solar.,87,,
699,0.97,4512.875,4522.885,"But at the current state, it was a big cost to the city, but we will definitely look at it in the next as costs continue to come down and new technologies emerge.",87,,
700,0.97,4522.885,4531.36,"And Councilmember, I just came from a meeting for the electric power research Institute, which we've talked with you about before.",88,,
701,0.97,4531.36,4538.233,"And we've talked about the Epiry study, the Electricification study there.",88,,
702,0.97,4538.233,4542.738,The leading arm of energy in the country.,88,,
703,0.97,4542.738,4544.773,"I would say Long-Duration energy storage, which we're talking about.",88,,
704,0.97,4544.773,4546.875,"Every meeting I go to, it's what we're talking about.",88,,
705,0.97,4546.875,4548.944,So I think it's very close.,88,,
706,0.97,4548.944,4563.892,"Some folks are starting, are doing pilot projects, particularly in California, where it was the fastest way to deal with a resource shortage, inadequacy, rolling out.",88,,
707,0.97,4563.892,4573.735,"I also want to see in our next rendition, so the next update that we do in two years, I would like to see more demand response.",88,,
708,0.97,4573.735,4574.803,The notion of connected loads.,88,,
709,0.97,4574.803,4577.472,And the notion of hot water heaters and et cetera.,88,,
710,0.97,4577.472,4582.277,So all of that is on the table.,88,,
711,0.97,4582.277,4587.816,And it's just not enough to fold into the current submitted Irp.,88,,
712,0.97,4587.816,4590.586,And this is a two-year plan.,89,,
713,0.97,4590.586,4590.953,Is that right?,89,,
714,0.97,4590.953,4591.887,Excuse me?,90,,
715,0.97,4591.887,4594.957,What we're voting on today is a two-year plan?,91,,
716,0.97,4594.957,4595.19,Yes.,92,,
717,0.97,4595.19,4602.23,"And we expect there will be a lot of shift and a lot of movement forward, and sending these emerging Technologies in the two-year period.",92,,
718,0.97,4602.23,4603.732,Thank you.,93,,
719,0.97,4603.732,4612.874,Okay.,94,,
720,0.97,4612.874,4619.915,"If there are no further questions, I think that we are ready to go for a vote.",94,,
721,0.97,4619.915,4622.651,The legislation has been moved and Seconded.,94,,
722,0.97,4622.651,4629.858,"Would the clerk please call on the community recommendation that Reslucks, that this resolution pass?",94,,
723,0.97,4629.858,4633.261,Council President Juarez?,95,,
724,0.97,4633.261,4633.562,Aye.,96,,

726,0.97,4634.096,4637.866,Abstain.,98,,
727,0.97,4637.866,4640.302,Councilmember Herbold?,99,,
728,0.97,4640.302,4640.869,Yes.,100,,
729,0.97,4640.869,4641.97,Chair Nelson?,101,,
730,0.97,4641.97,4644.94,Aye.,102,,
731,0.97,4644.94,4648.343,"Three in favor, one Abstained.",103,,
732,0.97,4648.343,4649.011,All right.,104,,
733,0.97,4649.011,4658.754,"The motion carries and the committee recommendation that the resolution pass will be forwarded to the city council on August 15th, for final consideration.",104,,
734,0.97,4658.754,4660.122,"Thank you very, very much, everyone.",104,,
735,0.97,4660.122,4662.557,I appreciate you being here.,104,,
736,0.97,4662.557,4663.158,Okay.,105,,
737,0.97,4663.158,4666.028,"Moving on to item 4, our last item.",105,,
738,0.97,4666.028,4668.93,Will the clerk please read item 4 into the record?,105,,
739,0.97,4668.93,4673.835,Agenda item 4.,106,,
740,0.97,4673.835,4681.91,"Seattle city light 2023 to 24 rate ordinance, briefing and discussion.",106,,
741,0.97,4681.91,4682.177,Okay.,107,,
742,0.97,4682.177,4690.052,This ordinance implements the rate path in city lights 2022 and 2026 Stateggic plan.,107,,
743,0.97,4690.052,4692.754,And Council approved that on August 23rd.,107,,
744,0.97,4692.754,4699.561,"So before going into discussion, I am going to touch on some of the issues that were raised during that process.",107,,
745,0.97,4699.561,4710.505,By saying that city light has held customer builds steady by eliminating an approved rate increase in 2021 and reducing it in 2022.,107,,
746,0.97,4710.505,4717.179,"At the same time, costs of generating and distributing electricity went up a lot in the past three years.",107,,
747,0.97,4717.179,4722.784,"The price of steel, aluminum and copper rose by 70 to 80%.",107,,
748,0.97,4722.784,4729.925,"The proposed residential rate increases 5.7, or about $4 a month.",107,,
749,0.97,4729.925,4738.233,That increase is less than overall inflation and is still not the enough to cover the rising cost of rising electricity.,107,,
750,0.97,4738.233,4741.269,"In many cases, raising rates by double that.",107,,
751,0.97,4741.269,4743.038,Just to maintain basic service levels.,107,,
752,0.97,4743.038,4748.577,"And as a public utility, we have already noticeably low rates.",107,,
753,0.97,4748.577,4771.466,"So to hold these rates down as much as possible, city light is cutting spending in other areas and as mentioned already, for customers having trouble paying their bills, whether residential, heavy or light users, we do have programs Totailor to fit those needs.",107,,
754,0.97,4771.466,4772.667,We have team members here.,107,,
755,0.97,4772.667,4775.904,"Please introduce yourself, and I look forward Toweriopresentation.",107,,
756,0.97,4775.904,4781.476,"Again, my name is Debra Smith, and I'm the general manager and Ceo of Seattle city light.",108,,
757,0.97,4781.476,4785.614,And I have my amazing people here with me.,108,,
758,0.97,4785.614,4788.116,We'll start with Kirsty Grainger.,108,,
759,0.97,4788.116,4789.885,Good morning.,109,,
760,0.97,4789.885,4791.653,"Kirsty Granger, city light chief financial officer.",109,,
761,0.97,4791.653,4800.395,"Good morning, Craig Smith, city light chief customer office.",110,,
762,0.97,4800.395,4801.863,Chris green.,111,,
763,0.97,4801.863,4803.465,Carsten Croff.,112,,
764,0.97,4803.465,4808.97,"Before you condition, I should say, we are not voting on this today.",113,,
765,0.97,4808.97,4813.008,Weville another discussion and possible vote on September 14th.,113,,
766,0.97,4813.008,4813.441,"Go ahead, please.",113,,
767,0.97,4813.441,4813.742,Great.,114,,
768,0.97,4813.742,4814.042,All right.,114,,
769,0.97,4814.042,4825.854,So can we go to the next slide please?,114,,
770,0.97,4825.854,4832.26,This is city lights Bienial ordinances.,115,,
771,0.97,4832.26,4837.232,"Authorized last month by city Council, via city lights strategic plan.",115,,
772,0.97,4837.232,4848.243,"These rate increases are designed to produce the amount of revenue that city light needs to deliver reliable, clean and socially responsible electric service for the next biennium.",115,,
773,0.97,4848.243,4852.48,And that the timing of this ordinance.,115,,
774,0.97,4852.48,4855.05,So it comes after the strategic plan.,115,,
775,0.97,4855.05,4860.722,"And then it will align with the budget, of course, where the city council will turn their attention to later this year.",115,,
776,0.97,4860.722,4866.328,So that is the timing of this ordinance.,115,,
777,0.97,4866.328,4880.308,"So the rate increases, which are 4.5% for 2023 and 2024, reflect the impacts of significantly higher invasion, as well as lower increases in Ö021.",115,,
778,0.97,4880.308,4886.047,"And in 2022, that were a part of Seattle's Covid response.",115,,
779,0.97,4886.047,4896.558,"And in 2022, our rate increase was 2.1%, which was less than the increase approved by the previous plan.",115,,
780,0.97,4896.558,4908.37,This ordinance also Imelements implements some Farybl significant policy changes and design that are many years in the making.,115,,
781,0.97,4908.37,4915.977,And some might remember the work that we did with the city light Council and pandemic on a rate study.,115,,
782,0.97,4915.977,4940.268,So this ordinance implements some of the policy recommendations that came out of that work as well as implements the cost of service study which takes actual costs and uses them to assign increases across our customer classes.,115,,
783,0.97,4940.268,4943.838,So next slide please.,116,,
784,0.97,4943.838,4946.007,We're going it start talking rate changes.,116,,
785,0.97,4946.007,4956.184,And then we'll move into talking a little bit more about the increases and a little more about afford Ablghtd impacts.,116,,
786,0.97,4956.184,4961.156,"Back in 2019, city light completed a rate policy study.",116,,
787,0.97,4961.156,4967.195,And this was in conjunction with our citizens city light review panel.,116,,
788,0.97,4967.195,4979.541,It was in response to a request from city council city council in resolution.,116,,
789,0.97,4979.541,4998.827,"The city described goals, which you can summarize there and also identified strategies for meeting these goals so this features a couple of strategies.",116,,
790,0.97,4998.827,5007.135,Which include incorporate a fixed base rate charge for all customers.,116,,
791,0.97,5007.135,5017.345,We're going to be incorporating a time of day rate for all customers.,116,,
792,0.97,5017.345,5021.916,Also adjusting our legacy block structure to facilitate this.,116,,
793,0.97,5021.916,5023.418,Next slide please.,116,,
794,0.97,5023.418,5025.854,So the time of day rate option.,116,,
795,0.97,5025.854,5027.522,This isn't coming until 2024.,116,,
796,0.97,5027.522,5038.533,"But in many ways, this is the biggest policy change that we're making and one that is the longest coming.",116,,
797,0.97,5038.533,5044.806,This dates back to city light rolling out advanced meters throughout our territory.,116,,
798,0.97,5044.806,5055.55,"And again, we completed the policy framework in 2019 that we identified, where we want to use the new advanced meter technology in our rates.",116,,
799,0.97,5055.55,5060.355,"We have been working over the last several years, putting meters to our system.",116,,
800,0.97,5060.355,5062.524,To make billing time of day possible.,116,,
801,0.97,5062.524,5068.129,"Then here we are today, with the rate ordinance, setting rates for the next two years.",116,,
802,0.97,5068.129,5083.545,"And in 2024, this new time of day rate option will become available for all of our residential and smaller business customers.",116,,
803,0.97,5083.545,5090.185,R we'll be doing a lot of outreach work in preparation for this Rollout in 2024.,117,,
804,0.97,5090.185,5094.222,Next slide please.,117,,
805,0.97,5094.222,5109.771,A little more on the time of rate Disiefnlt designed to have these three periods.,118,,
806,0.97,5109.771,5110.371,The Midpeak period.,118,,
807,0.97,5110.371,5118.713,The time to encourage customers to move away from use during the High-Peak period of 5:00 P.M.,118,,
808,0.97,5118.713,5119.714,To 9:00 P.M.,118,,
809,0.97,5119.714,5124.319,So you can see that electricity there is priced higher during the peak period.,118,,
810,0.97,5124.319,5144.939,"And Conversely, in the early morning hours, between midnight and 6:00 a.m., when the system has the most capacity, when energy is priced very low we would offer a low, Per- kilowatt.",118,,
811,0.97,5144.939,5151.279,And offer customers who would like to opt in a new way to manage their electricity bills.,118,,
812,0.97,5151.279,5170.698,"We did a little example here for an Ev owner, showing that if they were to choose to charge their vehicle in the evening during the most expensive period, that the price would be almost twice as much for them as it would be if they were to set their charger to charge between midnight and 6:00 A.M.",118,,
813,0.97,5170.698,5184.212,"So they would have the opportunity to save, by shifting the way they charge their vehicle.",118,,
814,0.97,5186.214,5188.283,If they chose to.,118,,
815,0.97,5188.283,5191.052,"So looking ahead, there will be ways.",118,,
816,0.97,5191.052,5194.589,We are looking to offer the customer.,118,,
817,0.97,5194.589,5201.863,"And in many ways, we're building for technology that Snot even here yet.",118,,
818,0.97,5201.863,5204.699,And just to note.,119,,
819,0.97,5204.699,5206.935,People wonder about the equity.,119,,
820,0.97,5206.935,5213.508,You can buy smart plugs and switches that allow you to control your appliances remotely.,119,,
821,0.97,5213.508,5214.042,And they're inexpensive.,119,,
822,0.97,5214.042,5217.879,And you can buy them at best buy.,119,,
823,0.97,5217.879,5223.885,We absolutely believe in the new appliances will be smart appliances that give folks the opportunity.,119,,
824,0.97,5223.885,5230.625,But there are also Workarounds that are relatively inexpensive and very accessible to people.,119,,
825,0.97,5230.625,5234.329,We're also introducing a weight rate specifically for commercial charging.,120,,
826,0.97,5234.329,5242.837,So this would be for companies that offer Ev charging or maybe fleets.,120,,
827,0.97,5242.837,5245.773,So this is based on a pilot program that we have now.,120,,
828,0.97,5245.773,5252.58,That would expand that commercial charging rate to be a permanent feature.,120,,
829,0.97,5252.58,5258.62,"So moving on, another rate design change is introducing a basic service charge for all of our customers.",120,,
830,0.97,5258.62,5272.2,"So this would be a fee that all customers would pay that covers a portion of the cost of customer everybody's service, meter reading, billing.",120,,
831,0.97,5272.2,5275.937,"These would all be things a customer would use, even if they didn't use electricity.",120,,
832,0.97,5275.937,5279.874,"And you can see there, in the table, at the top.",120,,
833,0.97,5279.874,5284.912,"Currently for residential customers, the fee is $6 per month.",120,,
834,0.97,5284.912,5289.484,And we would be proposing that Incrementally.,120,,
835,0.97,5289.484,5292.487,And then $7 to $8 for 2024.,120,,
836,0.97,5292.487,5297.692,"For general service, commercial and industrial rates, there currently isn't a base service charge.",120,,
837,0.97,5297.692,5301.062,So we would propose to introduce one for all of these customers.,120,,
838,0.97,5301.062,5311.706,"And you can see that depending on the size of the customer, it ranges from $7 all the way up to a few thousand.",120,,
839,0.97,5311.706,5312.273,And just for context.,120,,
840,0.97,5312.273,5312.607,High demand.,120,,
841,0.97,5312.607,5316.611,I think we only have about 14 High-Demand customers.,120,,
842,0.97,5316.611,5323.618,"So these would be very, very large customers, just to put that into context.",120,,
843,0.97,5323.618,5325.353,And the why behind this?,120,,
844,0.97,5325.353,5331.659,It's a fair way to allocate this cost.,120,,
845,0.97,5331.659,5334.429,And assigns cost in a way that is both fair and effective.,120,,
846,0.97,5334.429,5341.703,"This is really an industry best practice, that we're seeing most utilities would see that our neighbors have a fee like this on their bills.",120,,
847,0.97,5341.703,5349.844,"So you know, we really feel like we're moving in the right direction and towards industry best practice.",120,,
848,0.97,5349.844,5354.615,"One quick misconception that we just wanted to clear up, just in case, that folks don't understand this.",120,,
849,0.97,5354.615,5358.353,"Just as a reminder, you know, city light, we are a public utility.",120,,
850,0.97,5358.353,5361.489,The purpose of this fee is not to generate more revenue.,120,,
851,0.97,5361.489,5367.595,It's simply to change the way that we collect revenue from our customers.,120,,
852,0.97,5367.595,5373.468,It doesn't result in higher rates overall.,120,,
853,0.97,5373.468,5374.635,It's just adding a different component.,120,,
854,0.97,5374.635,5384.746,You can see in the bar charts that the revenue collection is the same under the no customer charge with it.,120,,
855,0.97,5384.746,5390.551,"So from the utility's perspective, the revenue doesn't change, it's just changing how we collect it from our customers.",120,,
856,0.97,5390.551,5392.52,And I'm not asking to you move.,121,,
857,0.97,5392.52,5399.026,But going back to one of the Earliestslides when we talked about the rates and goals.,121,,
858,0.97,5399.026,5405.767,"This is in direct response to rate stabilization, revenue stabilization.",121,,
859,0.97,5405.767,5411.572,"As we have increasingly stable revenue sources, it allows us to be flexible and more Adaptive.",121,,
860,0.97,5411.572,5416.711,And this policy change in particular is one that we work closely with the revenue panel.,122,,
861,0.97,5416.711,5418.98,And with the Northwest energy coalition on this design.,122,,
862,0.97,5418.98,5422.984,"So we're grateful to Nancy for coming today, and expressing her support for this.",122,,
863,0.97,5422.984,5431.259,And we thank her for her partnership in the work that we did to get to this recommendation.,122,,
864,0.97,5431.259,5437.398,So the next slide is just a summary of these rate design changes.,122,,
865,0.97,5437.398,5443.137,"So for these customers, we're going to see this small increase in the per meter service charge.",122,,
866,0.97,5443.137,5445.239,And the new rate of day charge.,122,,
867,0.97,5445.239,5459.12,"I should add, too, as I mentioned earlier, there were also modifications we're making to our Struct tower facilitate this transition to offer customers the option to do the standard or the time of day rate.",122,,
868,0.97,5459.12,5465.827,"For business customers or the general service customers, we're introducing a new basic service charge for all customer classes.",122,,
869,0.97,5465.827,5470.731,"The new time of day rate option is coming in 2024, for small and medium general service.",122,,
870,0.97,5470.731,5475.57,"For the large and high demand, they already have a mandatory time of day rate.",122,,
871,0.97,5475.57,5477.738,And have for many years.,122,,
872,0.97,5477.738,5480.341,"And finally, the new Opt-In commercial charging rate as well.",122,,
873,0.97,5480.341,5483.811,That's a variation on the time of day rate for commercial charging.,122,,
874,0.97,5483.811,5486.881,"This is also, this is a big ordinance.",122,,
875,0.97,5486.881,5491.085,So there are many other technical changes that are happening.,122,,
876,0.97,5491.085,5493.688,"We're working with Eric Mcconaghy, with all of those.",122,,
877,0.97,5493.688,5497.859,We're making updates to the large Solarprogram and a lot of other things this.,122,,
878,0.97,5497.859,5502.163,Is all wrapped into this 60- page ordinance.,122,,
879,0.97,5502.163,5509.937,"So a little bit more on the rate increases, if we could move forward a couple of slides.",122,,
880,0.97,5509.937,5512.874,There we go . a little more on the 4.5%.,122,,
881,0.97,5512.874,5519.58,What is driving up city lights rates?,122,,
882,0.97,5519.58,5521.849,"The short answer is, it's inflation.",122,,
883,0.97,5521.849,5528.723,And we are seeing rising costs in raw materials.,122,,
884,0.97,5528.723,5534.128,"The price of steel, aluminum, copper.",122,,
885,0.97,5534.128,5540.167,Gone up 70 to 80% in 2020.,122,,
886,0.97,5540.167,5541.869,"Similarly, underground table, Conduit polls.",122,,
887,0.97,5541.869,5548.242,We're seeing all of these materials that city light uses to deliver electric services.,122,,
888,0.97,5548.242,5555.349,"And as well, you can see here that the city's office of economic and revenue forecasts, this is the CPI forecast.",122,,
889,0.97,5555.349,5561.689,And you can see how much it's changed just in one year.,122,,
890,0.97,5561.689,5566.494,"In 2021, 2022 and 2023, we're seeing increases in the 5% range.",122,,
891,0.97,5566.494,5577.805,"And I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, that since this forecast, the office has introduced a new update that is even higher.",122,,
892,0.97,5577.805,5589.183,"And so just to emphasize that the rate increases that are in this ordinance, reflect inflation that we are seeing today, and that we have been seeing in 2021 as well.",122,,
893,0.97,5589.183,5592.987,"And in some ways, we're catching up for price increases that are happening as we speak.",122,,
894,0.97,5592.987,5607.802,"And if I could just add to this, I mean, I--since I got here almost four years ago, one of my main focuses has been on changing the rate trajectory for city light.",123,,
895,0.97,5607.802,5614.809,"We had, historically had rate actions that were in the 5 to 6% for range.",123,,
896,0.97,5614.809,5619.68,"They were double, at least what we were experiencing from an inflationary perspective.",123,,
897,0.97,5619.68,5623.884,And it was clear to everyone that that was not a sustainable path.,123,,
898,0.97,5623.884,5627.188,And so we worked very hard to change that.,123,,
899,0.97,5627.188,5641.836,"And we were really, and I think, feeling pretty good about where we were headed and how quickly we were heading there, when we submitted last year's strategic plan.",123,,
900,0.97,5641.836,5646.407,"When folks first came out, I said, look.",123,,
901,0.97,5646.407,5659.887,"We can't do this and they quickly said, we can't balance the budget and provide the level of service that customers, I think, not--not that they need, but that they should expect from us.",123,,
902,0.97,5659.887,5662.356,Without funding some of these inflationary pressures.,123,,
903,0.97,5662.356,5672.066,"You know, as it is, we are still struggling in many ways, particularly because of our vacancy rate right now, to provide the level of service that we want.",123,,
904,0.97,5672.066,5680.141,"But we know that especially with new connections, continuing to grow, and we're seeing them go up right now.",123,,
905,0.97,5680.141,5680.941,We are working hard.,123,,
906,0.97,5680.941,5692.72,"And in some cases, we are actually, in order to get customers connected, we are actually doing Work-Arounds from a supply side that allow us to connect, but that ultimately will mean higher costs.",123,,
907,0.97,5692.72,5695.556,So there simply wasn't any way to absorb all of it.,123,,
908,0.97,5695.556,5703.731,And we absorbed a lot of it.,123,,
909,0.97,5703.731,5707.368,"So in the next slide, we'll talk a little bit --",124,,
910,0.97,5707.368,5707.935,Pause.,125,,
911,0.97,5707.935,5710.538,Could you pause a moment please?,125,,
912,0.97,5710.538,5711.038,Councilmember Herbold.,125,,
913,0.97,5711.038,5712.173,I appreciate it.,126,,
914,0.97,5712.173,5712.64,Thank you very much.,126,,
915,0.97,5712.64,5716.243,I did have a question about that slide.,126,,
916,0.97,5716.243,5741.001,"I'm wondering, it's very clear that rate changes are being drink by one that is affecting the ongoing operating costs but also the capital projects that are within Seattle light, CLC.",126,,
917,0.97,5741.001,5752.446,"Is there any way to break out sort of the explanation for the increases, so we can see how much is driven by capital projects, versus ongoing operating costs?",126,,
918,0.97,5752.446,5752.78,And Secondly.,126,,
919,0.97,5752.78,5755.95,And I feel like I've asked this question before.,126,,
920,0.97,5755.95,5757.852,And I apologize.,126,,
921,0.97,5757.852,5763.124,What is your capital project completion rate assumption?,126,,
922,0.97,5763.124,5765.292,We did a lot of work --,127,,
923,0.97,5765.292,5768.295,"We struggle to hear you, Councilmember.",128,,
924,0.97,5768.295,5771.098,"On the first part of your question, that's not a problem at all.",128,,
925,0.97,5771.098,5776.07,"In fact, on the first part, we had a slide showing our CHP was going down.",128,,
926,0.97,5776.07,5777.938,That is a tool we used.,128,,
927,0.97,5777.938,5782.109,That service coverage I spoke to earlier and to maintain the rate strategy.,128,,
928,0.97,5782.109,5786.147,What was the second part of your question?,128,,
929,0.97,5786.147,5788.382,Your capital rate project completion assumption.,129,,
930,0.97,5788.382,5794.021,That was a tool we used in the deliberations around Seattle public utility rates.,129,,
931,0.97,5794.021,5800.561,They had proposed a rate path that assumes all projects are completed 100% on time.,129,,
932,0.97,5800.561,5811.238,"We looked historically to see what was actually the history, and we applied that rate to the rate structure and were able to bring down some of the rates.",129,,
933,0.97,5811.238,5811.539,Right.,130,,
934,0.97,5811.539,5811.906,Great question.,130,,
935,0.97,5811.906,5817.778,"And I'll turn it over to car Sten, who is our technical expert on this.",130,,
936,0.97,5817.778,5818.412,But you're absolutely right.,130,,
937,0.97,5818.412,5827.588,The number you would see in our Capitol program coming in the budget is going to be different than the number we used.,130,,
938,0.97,5827.588,5831.859,But I'll let Carsten talk a little about the technicality to that.,130,,
939,0.97,5831.859,5833.694,Quick answer is 90% completion rate.,131,,
940,0.97,5833.694,5838.632,"And we also, for many years, have been making cash adjustments, right?",131,,
941,0.97,5838.632,5842.069,"To the CIP budget, in terms of when that spending is actually going to occur.",131,,
942,0.97,5842.069,5845.306,So we already have that taken into consideration.,131,,
943,0.97,5845.306,5845.673,Thank you.,132,,
944,0.97,5845.673,5849.176,And I do think I asked this question observe.,133,,
945,0.97,5849.176,5849.777,But thank you for answering.,133,,
946,0.97,5849.777,5851.545,And we are continuing to watch it.,134,,
947,0.97,5851.545,5860.554,Just like we are continuing to watch and make reasonable Sawmpledzs how long it takes back to our typical staffing.,134,,
948,0.97,5860.554,5862.122,"Typically, we have a 6% vacancy rate.",134,,
949,0.97,5862.122,5866.894,We're not assuming that we get there in this plan.,134,,
950,0.97,5866.894,5869.296,Because we're currently at 17% vacancy rate.,134,,
951,0.97,5869.296,5874.301,We don't want to artificially slow down projects in order to reduce rates.,135,,
952,0.97,5874.301,5883.911,But we do want to make assumptions that are based on sort of the historical practices and experiences of the Department.,135,,
953,0.97,5883.911,5884.545,So really appreciate that.,135,,
954,0.97,5884.545,5884.845,Thank you.,135,,
955,0.97,5884.845,5887.548,Absolutely.,136,,
956,0.97,5887.548,5893.721,And those same assumptions are driving how the size and timing of our sales as well.,136,,
957,0.97,5893.721,5898.959,"On the one hand, we want to make sure we have sufficient cash to the work we're doing.",136,,
958,0.97,5898.959,5905.699,"But on the other hand, there's a cost to that cash and we don't want to have more than we really need.",136,,
959,0.97,5905.699,5906.066,Great question.,136,,
960,0.97,5906.066,5906.5,Thank you.,136,,
961,0.97,5906.5,5908.168,Rate increases by customer class.,137,,
962,0.97,5908.168,5914.408,"Again, this is the result of a cost of service study, which takes actual costs.",137,,
963,0.97,5914.408,5922.716,"And then uses it to allocate the costs across rate classes, based on what we're seeing, as far as where we're actually spending.",137,,
964,0.97,5922.716,5927.521,"And typically, we would do a cost of service study every two years.",137,,
965,0.97,5927.521,5930.557,"However, you know, into the pandemic, there was a break there.",137,,
966,0.97,5930.557,5934.929,It's actually been four years since city light has completed a full cost of service study.,137,,
967,0.97,5934.929,5939.6,"These increases that you see here, reflect four years of evolution of spending.",137,,
968,0.97,5939.6,5945.506,Just to talk through a few of the changes here.,137,,
969,0.97,5945.506,5950.477,"So again, the average system wide for all customers is 4.5%.",137,,
970,0.97,5950.477,5957.518,"For residential, and small general service, the small business customers, this increase is a little bit higher.",137,,
971,0.97,5957.518,5967.561,"And this is owing to, when, for Lowerusers, a larger portion of their bill comes from fixed costs like customer service, as well as the delivery costs.",137,,
972,0.97,5967.561,5971.966,So that's the polls and the wires and infrastructure it takes to deliver the electricity.,137,,
973,0.97,5971.966,5980.24,And what we're seeing is that more of our spending is going there to infrastructure maintenance than it is on the cost of the bulk power.,137,,
974,0.97,5980.24,5983.577,Like the generation of the purchasing of the electricity.,137,,
975,0.97,5983.577,5990.05,"So that's why, for the lower use customers, residential and small, the increases are a little bit higher.",137,,
976,0.97,5990.05,5993.12,And for the larger customers.,137,,
977,0.97,5993.12,6001.895,"Who use more electricity and for whom more of their bills is coming from, the cost of bulk power, the increases are a bit lower.",137,,
978,0.97,6001.895,6004.231,In the network.,137,,
979,0.97,6004.231,6017.511,"Again, we're seeing, and I should explain that, the network is a small number of customers in the downtown core, who other than served on a premium network service, which means that it is redundant and very reliable.",137,,
980,0.97,6017.511,6021.682,"Their rates are higher than for other customers, overall.",137,,
981,0.97,6021.682,6025.319,But their increases for the next two years are lower.,137,,
982,0.97,6025.319,6034.528,"And this is partly, again, because we're spending a little bit less than we have been historically on the network.",137,,
983,0.97,6034.528,6050.077,"And and also, I should say, this these, this is normal to see a little variation from average, across the cust more classes and lat the last time we did one of these, the network was higher.",137,,
984,0.97,6050.077,6053.28,"So this will correct over time, if that makes sense.",137,,
985,0.97,6053.28,6060.287,"So bottom line, these increase--this is the way the increases are getting allocated to the customer classes.",137,,
986,0.97,6060.287,6062.623,And these little variations are normal.,137,,
987,0.97,6062.623,6066.16,"And we'll adjust them in two years, when we do the next cost of service.",137,,
988,0.97,6066.16,6072.199,"And I want to just throw out one thing, just as a reminder, and partially because Councilmember Nelson.",138,,
989,0.97,6072.199,6077.204,"I know this is a new gig for you, et cetera.",138,,
990,0.97,6077.204,6081.842,"But Councilmember, many years ago, we have, we passed through Bonneville rates.",138,,
991,0.97,6081.842,6090.484,"So in addition to having a rate stabilization account, which Helpsmanage the fluctuations, associated with secondary revenue.",138,,
992,0.97,6090.484,6093.32,And I think we're all familiar with that.,138,,
993,0.97,6093.32,6106.867,There is also a--is it an ordinance that requires or allows us to pass through adjustments or changes in Bonneville's rates from the assumption we make in these plans.,138,,
994,0.97,6106.867,6116.977,"So these, both the rates that you're looking at for 2023 and 2024, make an assumption around what the power rates will be from Bonneville.",138,,
995,0.97,6116.977,6119.279,Bonneville does rate cases every two years.,138,,
996,0.97,6119.279,6122.516,And they have a Funky Federal--they do the Federal year.,138,,
997,0.97,6122.516,6124.751,So it starts October 1.,138,,
998,0.97,6124.751,6128.522,So we had a rate action from Bonneville last October 1.,138,,
999,0.97,6128.522,6136.363,And we will have a rate action on October 1 of 2023.,138,,
1000,0.97,6136.363,6136.797,Very preliminarily.,138,,
1001,0.97,6136.797,6140.434,So I'm just doing this so that folks understand.,138,,
1002,0.97,6140.434,6147.741,"Depending on what Bonneville came through, you could see an increase or decrease, that we would net or add to the numbers that you see here.",138,,
1003,0.97,6147.741,6152.613,"Preliminarily, it looks like the 2024 numbers could see a net decrease.",138,,
1004,0.97,6152.613,6161.522,So that would mean what customers might see is something less than what you're seeing up there for the 2024 case.,138,,
1005,0.97,6161.522,6166.326,"In 2023, it would only be for three months will so it would have minimal impact.",138,,
1006,0.97,6166.326,6171.632,"But for 2024, it could certainly have an impact of up to a 1% reduction.",138,,
1007,0.97,6171.632,6174.468,And that's based on what we're hearing today.,138,,
1008,0.97,6174.468,6177.137,Good news.,139,,
1009,0.97,6177.137,6177.771,All right.,140,,
1010,0.97,6177.771,6178.171,So moving on.,140,,
1011,0.97,6178.171,6181.975,To talk a little bit about impacts and Affordability.,140,,
1012,0.97,6181.975,6183.644,I'm sorry.,141,,
1013,0.97,6183.644,6183.877,I'm --,141,,
1014,0.97,6183.877,6184.144,Yeah.,142,,
1015,0.97,6184.144,6186.38,Excuse me.,143,,
1016,0.97,6186.38,6186.914,Follow-up question?,143,,
1017,0.97,6186.914,6187.548,Thank you.,144,,
1018,0.97,6187.548,6192.719,"Just a question on that last slide, again.",144,,
1019,0.97,6192.719,6193.854,Could we go back to it?,144,,
1020,0.97,6193.854,6200.928,I'm sorry.,144,,
1021,0.97,6200.928,6207.834,So the--I'll try to filibuster here.,145,,
1022,0.97,6207.834,6224.451,"The rate increases for 2023, as you mentioned, showed some disparity between the residential and small Businesscustomers from the small, medium and large customers, and you explained that, what that was.",145,,
1023,0.97,6224.451,6232.125,"And I'm wondering, what happens in 2024, that that disparity shrinks so much?",145,,
1024,0.97,6232.125,6236.53,The individual rate increases are much more aligned in 2024.,145,,
1025,0.97,6236.53,6248.242,"And it sounded to me like the reason that you gave for the disparity in 2024, basically, it costs more to provide the energy to those customers.",145,,
1026,0.97,6248.242,6252.179,It seemed like that would be still the case in 2024.,145,,
1027,0.97,6252.179,6254.014,Great question.,146,,
1028,0.97,6254.014,6254.348,Yeah.,146,,
1029,0.97,6254.348,6259.92,So the 2023 rates are capturing four years of evolving cost of service.,146,,
1030,0.97,6259.92,6261.288,So it's making that correction.,146,,
1031,0.97,6261.288,6264.825,"And then in 2024, it's sort of staying on that same course.",146,,
1032,0.97,6264.825,6273.333,"So since these are changes from the previous year, you're seeing the correction in 2023, reflecting the four years of cost of service.",146,,
1033,0.97,6273.333,6279.106,"But then in 2024, it's the same.",146,,
1034,0.97,6279.106,6279.406,Perfect.,147,,
1035,0.97,6279.406,6281.942,Thank you.,147,,
1036,0.97,6281.942,6282.209,Great.,148,,
1037,0.97,6282.209,6282.576,Good question.,148,,
1038,0.97,6282.576,6282.843,Okay.,149,,
1039,0.97,6282.843,6286.847,So a little bit about Affordability.,149,,
1040,0.97,6286.847,6291.585,So looking at other major U.S.,149,,
1041,0.97,6291.585,6302.329,"Cities, looking at our other utility counterparts, just take a moment to note that we believe that Seattle leads the nation in affordable and Progressive rate offerings.",149,,
1042,0.97,6302.329,6307.934,"We do, as a public utility, we offer competitive rates, compared to other major U.S.",149,,
1043,0.97,6307.934,6311.271,Cities.,149,,
1044,0.97,6311.271,6317.044,"And these rate design changes, we believe are moving us in a more progressive direction.",149,,
1045,0.97,6317.044,6329.79,"At the same time, our progressive rate design is Complemented by Affordability programs, one of which is Seattle's utility discount program, which we're very proud of.",149,,
1046,0.97,6329.79,6335.495,"It's not to say, we can always make it better.",149,,
1047,0.97,6335.495,6342.769,"But it offers 65% discount for qualified customers, on top of our competitive rates.",149,,
1048,0.97,6342.769,6349.076,And our U Dp is funded by all of our customers through their rates.,149,,
1049,0.97,6349.076,6353.547,So everyone contributes to the Udp through their rates.,149,,
1050,0.97,6353.547,6362.656,"And just as a note, because commercial and High-Demand customers, so higher users have bigger bills than smaller users.",149,,
1051,0.97,6362.656,6366.66,And they comprise 60% of the funding for utility discount program.,149,,
1052,0.97,6366.66,6368.228,Because they have higher usage and higher bills.,149,,
1053,0.97,6368.228,6375.235,So this is a program that is funded by all of our customers.,149,,
1054,0.97,6375.235,6378.572,And it's available to customers who need help on their bills.,149,,
1055,0.97,6378.572,6391.752,And so you can see that Seattle's average rate is 11 sends Pe kilowatt hour.,149,,
1056,0.97,6391.752,6396.189,"That's not to say, there is an opportunity to do more and improve.",149,,
1057,0.97,6396.189,6403.163,So we're looking forward to that and looking forward to bringing more information on that next year.,149,,
1058,0.97,6403.163,6410.17,"But on the next slide, go to--a little bit more at rate design and Affordability.",149,,
1059,0.97,6410.17,6417.778,"As I said, rate design is one tool for meeting Affordability needs and it's targeted programs.",149,,
1060,0.97,6417.778,6426.286,"And one of the reasons for this, we know through our research, that households in Seattle, have a really diverse energy use Profile.",149,,
1061,0.97,6426.286,6431.992,And that we know that high- income households can be high users.,149,,
1062,0.97,6431.992,6435.695,But they can also be very low users.,149,,
1063,0.97,6435.695,6442.369,"And Conversely, just because a household is low income, does not necessarily mean they are low use.",149,,
1064,0.97,6442.369,6446.506,A local income household could be a single person living in a very small apartment.,149,,
1065,0.97,6446.506,6452.813,"But it could also be a Multigenerational family, renting a home, with electric Baseboard heat.",149,,
1066,0.97,6452.813,6463.356,"So you can see in the Histo gram that we have here, that when we analyze the Udp and Nonudp.",149,,
1067,0.97,6463.356,6465.358,The profiles look the same.,149,,
1068,0.97,6465.358,6470.797,"So we see that same diversity, amongst the Udp and Non-Udp customers.",149,,
1069,0.97,6470.797,6474.768,What this means is that rate design is a tool for Affordability.,149,,
1070,0.97,6474.768,6476.403,But it isn't the only one.,149,,
1071,0.97,6476.403,6483.276,"So we have programs like Udp, budget billing, energy efficiency programs.",149,,
1072,0.97,6483.276,6484.211,To complement rate design.,149,,
1073,0.97,6484.211,6506.066,"And we also know as we move to 2024, and start offering customers options for how to manage their electric bills, new Affordability tools that, we recognize that communication outreach, language access, these would be really important components to a successful Rollout.",149,,
1074,0.97,6506.066,6508.568,To communities who might not hear.,149,,
1075,0.97,6508.568,6513.64,So we can ensure customers have the information they need for the program that is right for them.,149,,
1076,0.97,6513.64,6521.915,I think it's important to note that there are generally two reasons why folks will opt into a time of day pricing from a Whim.,150,,
1077,0.97,6521.915,6530.19,"One is because they see the opportunity to reduce their usage or reduce their bill, by changing when they use the product.",150,,
1078,0.97,6530.19,6533.793,Two is folks who have a very strong environmental ethic.,150,,
1079,0.97,6533.793,6539.933,So they are choosing the time of day rate.,150,,
1080,0.97,6539.933,6548.975,So that they can again contribute to--let me see if I can get this right.,150,,
1081,0.97,6548.975,6551.311,Reduce the plan for the high peaking areas.,150,,
1082,0.97,6551.311,6557.217,We know that still and likely many years to come Tthe peaking resources in the Northwest tends to be natural gas.,150,,
1083,0.97,6557.217,6563.623,So if I use less or I change my consumption and use it during Off-Peak periods.,150,,
1084,0.97,6563.623,6567.761,I'm hoping to reduce the amount of natural gas carbon that goes into the environment.,150,,
1085,0.97,6567.761,6582.542,"One of the things that we know from our research that which we Commission on our own and that which we participate with, that is syndicated research that reflects the industry.",151,,
1086,0.97,6582.542,6590.75,That city light customers are really among the most Environmentally-Conscious consumers in the country.,151,,
1087,0.97,6590.75,6599.359,"And they're very, very interested in getting more from us, around ways to save energy and then having more choice and more options.",151,,
1088,0.97,6599.359,6608.935,So this package really helps us to advance the goals and interests of customers.,151,,
1089,0.97,6608.935,6612.939,"Before you move on, you said something.",152,,
1090,0.97,6612.939,6613.673,When I first heard it.,152,,
1091,0.97,6613.673,6619.946,I thought it was sort of Counterintuitive.,152,,
1092,0.97,6619.946,6625.585,"So High-Use customers, don't necessarily have large homes.",152,,
1093,0.97,6625.585,6629.689,"Which also reflects, could reflect income.",152,,
1094,0.97,6629.689,6635.962,It's often times older homes that are less efficient.,152,,
1095,0.97,6635.962,6639.899,So High-Use customers are often can be on the lower end of the income level.,152,,
1096,0.97,6639.899,6652.078,And so I think that you said that that is one reason why the service charge is important to equal out.,152,,
1097,0.97,6652.078,6652.345,Yeah.,153,,
1098,0.97,6652.345,6653.346,It's very longstanding.,153,,
1099,0.97,6653.346,6654.547,And really tough nut to crack.,153,,
1100,0.97,6654.547,6666.926,"Which is that when you're dealing particularly with rental properties, the property owner doesn't necessarily have the incentive to invest his or her dollars into making the property more efficient.",153,,
1101,0.97,6666.926,6670.03,And often folks who have limited choices.,153,,
1102,0.97,6670.03,6673.667,"Either not great credit or whatever it might be, can wind up in those homes.",153,,
1103,0.97,6673.667,6688.281,"At the same time, folks who have affluence and access to wealth, can afford to put rooftop solar on their homes, et cetera, which then decreases their consumption.",153,,
1104,0.97,6688.281,6701.861,"And we shifting some of at this time costs, it ensures customer whose have access into those dollars and technologies, are still paying their share of the fixed investment in the system.",153,,
1105,0.97,6701.861,6707.534,Thanks.,154,,
1106,0.97,6707.534,6709.569,Gwen?,155,,
1107,0.97,6709.569,6709.836,Okay.,156,,
1108,0.97,6709.836,6717.21,So this is the last side.,156,,
1109,0.97,6717.21,6719.579,"This is bill impacts example, residential customers.",156,,
1110,0.97,6719.579,6725.552,"You can see, this Saturday first block and Second-Block structure we've had for many years.",156,,
1111,0.97,6725.552,6729.322,"We have been each year, narrowing the block to make that a little flatter.",156,,
1112,0.97,6729.322,6733.326,"So you can see there, that the 13 cents is unchanged.",156,,
1113,0.97,6733.326,6738.164,And that the increases in the first block and then the basic service charge.,156,,
1114,0.97,6738.164,6747.307,"So you can see the small increases to the fixed basic service charge, from $6 to $7 to $8.",156,,
1115,0.97,6747.307,6753.747,"And just a reminder, Udp customers, they would receive a 60% on all of these rates.",156,,
1116,0.97,6753.747,6763.389,"The impact of the rate combined with the rate increase, comes out to between $3 and $5 for customers, depending on their use Profile.",156,,
1117,0.97,6763.389,6775.401,"You can see there, that as we discussed, depending on the heat source, or that the housing stock, that a customer lives in, that the installation or Whatnot.",156,,
1118,0.97,6775.401,6776.77,Their bill could vary a lot.,156,,
1119,0.97,6776.77,6782.909,But that the increases that they would see for a month would be under $5.,156,,
1120,0.97,6782.909,6798.057,"And then for Udp customers, which you'd see on the bottom part of the graph there, that the increase would be $1 to $2 per month as a result of the increases that we'd be proposing as a result of these ordinances.",156,,
1121,0.97,6798.057,6799.325,Thank you.,157,,
1122,0.97,6799.325,6799.859,Councilmember Herbold?,157,,
1123,0.97,6799.859,6802.328,I had a question about a previous slide.,158,,
1124,0.97,6802.328,6806.666,But now that we're on this one.,158,,
1125,0.97,6806.666,6814.507,"I don't understand the end block, the second block rate not changing.",158,,
1126,0.97,6814.507,6841.1,"So this is--one of our rate design strategies is to first and the second block . E in part because as we move towards offering customers a choice between our standard rate offering, which is this historical block rate and the time of day, it makes things a little bit simpler.",159,,
1127,0.97,6841.1,6849.008,"And then also again, customers block rate Harkens time.",159,,
1128,0.97,6849.008,6860.086,"And what we're seeing is that with changing technology with housing stock, customers' energy use profiles growing more and more diverse.",159,,
1129,0.97,6860.086,6864.29,The block rate structure is maybe not as progressive as it was 30 years ago.,159,,
1130,0.97,6864.29,6871.931,So we are evolving the structure to have the blocks be closer together.,159,,
1131,0.97,6871.931,6876.97,So customers that have high use aren't getting as much of a price shot.,159,,
1132,0.97,6876.97,6883.843,"And the other thing is, and this is part of--it's a great question.",160,,
1133,0.97,6883.843,6884.21,And it's tough.,160,,
1134,0.97,6884.21,6885.011,Feels counter intuitive.,161,,
1135,0.97,6885.011,6885.878,It is.,162,,
1136,0.97,6885.878,6886.613,But here's the thing.,162,,
1137,0.97,6886.613,6889.215,"There's two things, I would say.",162,,
1138,0.97,6889.215,6894.254,"One is that, as Kirsty said, this is very old rate structure.",162,,
1139,0.97,6894.254,6898.157,"When I worked at E-Web, they got rid of it also.",162,,
1140,0.97,6898.157,6912.505,"A from the ensuing time in the '70s when utilities put in these kinds of rate structures, customers no longer need the financial incentive to invest in energy or be efficient users of our product.",162,,
1141,0.97,6912.505,6922.982,"For the most part, as Craig mentioned, our customers are extremely knowledgeable in becoming their own energy experts.",162,,
1142,0.97,6922.982,6928.521,So we no longer find the need to financially Incent folks to use less.,162,,
1143,0.97,6928.521,6934.093,What we find is different needs to power of day.,162,,
1144,0.97,6934.093,6946.539,"And at the same time, as we look at this Decarbonized future, tiered rates don't Incent folks to Electrify.",162,,
1145,0.97,6946.539,6947.507,They discourage Electricification.,162,,
1146,0.97,6947.507,6951.577,Because the subsequent blocks for some utilities are higher.,162,,
1147,0.97,6951.577,6952.912,We want folks to Electrify.,162,,
1148,0.97,6952.912,6957.917,"That's how we turn the needle, move the needle on climate change, on carbon.",162,,
1149,0.97,6957.917,6965.091,"And so we certainly don't want a rate structure that Disincents them, even as we're encouraging them to take on a new vote.",162,,
1150,0.97,6965.091,6965.491,Makes sense.,163,,
1151,0.97,6965.491,6971.297,And I think you mentioned something that was a Segue to my earlier question.,163,,
1152,0.97,6971.297,6975.501,"On the time of day rates, which I love that idea.",163,,
1153,0.97,6975.501,6983.009,And I love that you're thinking about equity in moving towards time of day ratings.,163,,
1154,0.97,6983.009,6989.449,Scitake your word for it that there are a lot of smart appliance products out there.,163,,
1155,0.97,6989.449,6990.883,That are affordable.,163,,
1156,0.97,6990.883,7004.664,"But what might be affordable to you and I may--I would just love some sort of a comparison of products that are on the market, appliances that are and aren't.",163,,
1157,0.97,7004.664,7012.772,"Because it might be something that we want to look at, providing some sort of a rebate for, like we do for solar panels.",163,,
1158,0.97,7012.772,7013.106,Right.,164,,
1159,0.97,7013.106,7019.178,O so that would be just really interesting body of work if you could consider it.,165,,
1160,0.97,7019.178,7019.445,Right.,166,,
1161,0.97,7019.445,7026.152,"And our energy efficiency team, as we design programs, I mean, we're--we always lead with the equity lens.",166,,
1162,0.97,7026.152,7037.73,"And so, we're looking for ways to provide more tools for customers to understand more about their use in ways that they can shift with or without the use of technology.",166,,
1163,0.97,7037.73,7040.566,And also ways to make technology more accessible to them.,166,,
1164,0.97,7040.566,7043.87,"And it's important to note, too, that part of the timing.",167,,
1165,0.97,7043.87,7045.104,The timing on this.,167,,
1166,0.97,7045.104,7049.575,And I expect to get some hard questions from Councilmember Mosqueda on this.,167,,
1167,0.97,7049.575,7057.817,But the timing on this is really driven by our technology projects and the need to complete.,167,,
1168,0.97,7057.817,7069.962,"And have accurate, historical data, within our system, on homeowners and Renters' consumption being so that they can go on to the portal, the utility portal.",167,,
1169,0.97,7069.962,7074.467,"And they can price what their bill would look like, under both rate structures.",167,,
1170,0.97,7074.467,7082.675,So we're Committd to not making this change until customers can be assured that they personally will not lose.,167,,
1171,0.97,7082.675,7093.252,"So that's why 2024, because that's the soonest that we will have enough historical data to allow customers to go through that process, using the portal.",167,,
1172,0.97,7093.252,7093.82,Thank you.,168,,
1173,0.97,7093.82,7101.861,"The are the thing that we're trying to do here is make sure that we take the time, I mean, not just to rush and put out a rate.",169,,
1174,0.97,7101.861,7105.198,But that we design an experience for customers.,169,,
1175,0.97,7105.198,7107.967,"That you know, provides them with an accessible journey.",169,,
1176,0.97,7107.967,7114.273,"And not just one that we design among ourselves and then say, great utility.",169,,
1177,0.97,7114.273,7115.208,"Great rate, go for it.",169,,
1178,0.97,7115.208,7116.542,We know that's not going to work.,169,,
1179,0.97,7116.542,7125.318,So we want to take the time to do--to map the journeys with customers.,169,,
1180,0.97,7125.318,7126.552,And then comprehensively engage community.,169,,
1181,0.97,7126.552,7132.859,"And last thing I'll mention, as we're Tag-Teaming here is that within the budget that we've submitted to the Mayor's office.",170,,
1182,0.97,7132.859,7138.431,"And of course, that process is moving through its own time line.",170,,
1183,0.97,7138.431,7153.846,"There is a budget change request that has a comprehensive evaluation of the Udp program that is a joint project between Seattle public utilities, H SD, and city light.",170,,
1184,0.97,7153.846,7165.625,"So we're very committed to looking at, you know, how we can continue to be the more progressive utility in the country, where limited income rates are concerned.",170,,
1185,0.97,7165.625,7167.727,Thank you.,171,,
1186,0.97,7167.727,7173.733,"Don't you have a slide that says, questions?",171,,
1187,0.97,7173.733,7173.966,No.,172,,
1188,0.97,7173.966,7175.668,I'm just kidding.,173,,
1189,0.97,7175.668,7176.602,Thank you very much.,174,,
1190,0.97,7176.602,7180.973,This was a lot of information to take in.,174,,
1191,0.97,7180.973,7185.878,And the--can you please just address where the actual legislation is?,174,,
1192,0.97,7185.878,7189.749,And then I just have one final question.,174,,
1193,0.97,7189.749,7191.25,"Hello, customers.",175,,
1194,0.97,7191.25,7194.954,"Some legislation, I believe today is, well, I know for sure today is Wednesday.",175,,
1195,0.97,7194.954,7198.324,And I believe that legislation will be transmitted today.,175,,
1196,0.97,7198.324,7204.363,And then we'll go through the regular process to get to what is called introduction of our calendar.,175,,
1197,0.97,7204.363,7213.172,"And then it will be available and officially be for the committee for a vote at the next meeting, should you wish to do so.",175,,
1198,0.97,7213.172,7216.475,And so that's the status that I know about the legislation.,175,,
1199,0.97,7216.475,7220.146,"It's, as you might guess, large and technical.",175,,
1200,0.97,7220.146,7222.348,And make changes to the municipal code.,175,,
1201,0.97,7222.348,7225.184,Put these rates in them.,175,,
1202,0.97,7225.184,7232.959,It's 60-Something pages to take all of the good work the folks at City light have done and make them into code.,175,,
1203,0.97,7232.959,7235.361,But we expect to see that done today.,175,,
1204,0.97,7235.361,7240.967,"And if I have that wrong, folks at City light, if I have that wrong, please correct me.",175,,
1205,0.97,7240.967,7244.003,"And the good news is, we have a month.",176,,
1206,0.97,7244.003,7255.948,"And my colleagues can take--can dig into this information and send questions to Eric, in the meantime, before we come back on the 14th.",176,,
1207,0.97,7255.948,7257.617,One question.,176,,
1208,0.97,7257.617,7262.188,"You mentioned the oversight panel, I believe, Kirsty?",176,,
1209,0.97,7262.188,7267.86,I am not sure if I've got the nomenclature correct.,176,,
1210,0.97,7267.86,7272.365,"But the review panel, I believe, formally weighed in on the strategic plan.",176,,
1211,0.97,7272.365,7275.735,"So does that, which includes the rate pass?",176,,
1212,0.97,7275.735,7284.41,So is it implied then that they endorse the rank ordinance as well?,176,,
1213,0.97,7284.41,7284.644,Yes.,177,,
1214,0.97,7284.644,7293.152,"And I think owing to some vacation scheduling Mishaps, we weren't able to get coordinated.",177,,
1215,0.97,7293.152,7295.354,"But with the review panel, I believe 20 something.",177,,
1216,0.97,7295.354,7298.758,But we do know that they support our proposal.,177,,
1217,0.97,7298.758,7302.495,And they're prepared to provide Council with a letter in advance of the vote in September.,177,,
1218,0.97,7302.495,7302.962,All right.,178,,
1219,0.97,7302.962,7306.899,Thank you very much.,178,,
