21,0.97,149.949,159.292,Am speaking regarding appointment of Nathan Torgelson.,1,,
22,0.97,159.292,161.694,I think he has shown he is a dedicated Hard-Working guy.,1,,
23,0.97,161.694,173.506,I'm going to be urging that you need to help him in terms of updating the tree ordinance to give him authority to do things that need to be done because there are lapses in that ordinance.,1,,
24,0.97,173.506,199.933,"I would like to note that also a discussion with him in terms of dealing with the current ordinance that it says under the enforcement and penalties, the director shall have the authority to enforce the provisions of this chapter to issue permits, impose conditions and establish administrative procedures, guidelines and conduct inspections necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.",1,,
25,0.97,199.933,207.006,Under that I will say that among other things he has the ability right now to require that Arborists working in the city are licensed by Sdot.,1,,
26,0.97,207.006,212.312,There is no need to come back to the Council in terms of an ordinance for that.,1,,
27,0.97,212.312,221.854,In terms of the ordinance itself I would note that under the SMC 2511 during development exceptional trees being detected.,1,,
28,0.97,221.854,232.198,This is a loophole.,1,,
29,0.97,233.099,236.869,That's why you have people think don't clear cut Seattle because there is no protection brother trees during development.,1,,
30,0.97,236.869,239.539,Basically developers can remove any Non-Exceptional tree in the lot and they do that.,1,,
31,0.97,239.539,254.487,"The tree requirements coming under landscaping have this minimal requirement saying that single-family 5070 200-9600 square feet, all it needs is a minimum number of breaches of tree on lots 3000 square feet or larger.",1,,
32,0.97,254.487,263.296,"At least 2 caliper inches per 1000 square feet pick that means you can remove a huge number of trees, put back a couple.",1,,

43,0.97,298.331,307.54,I am here to testify in support of Nathan Torgelson's reappointment.,5,,
44,0.97,307.54,314.047,"We are trying to tackle this homelessness problem in our city and region by growing faster than we ever have before with five new buildings, 500 units in the next four years.",5,,
45,0.97,314.047,324.424,"Could not do that without Nathan Torgelson . Nathan and his team are efficient, professional, they are always looking to find new ways to support affordable and homeless housing.",5,,
46,0.97,324.424,334.167,And I think he does a really good job of selecting the city's priorities for ending homelessness and solving our housing crunch.,5,,
47,0.97,334.167,336.169,I have examples.,5,,
48,0.97,336.169,347.18,One example is the efforts round 2016 and 2017 streamlined permitting for affordable housing providers.,5,,
49,0.97,347.18,348.448,Nathan is critical to that process.,5,,
50,0.97,348.448,352.652,And he has made sure he and his team are responsive to when that doesn't work.,5,,
51,0.97,352.652,362.028,And providing permits on time and on schedule so we can provide housing as fast as possible for those most needy in our community.,5,,
52,0.97,362.028,379.679,"In fact, I think Nathan is an example to many other city departments, Sdot, city light, and others that could do more in streamlining the efficiency for when we bring this projects on.",5,,
53,0.97,379.679,381.114,I can't say enough good things about him.,5,,
54,0.97,381.114,390.623,"One specific example is a recent project, city owned the Plymouth is developing right across from the Seattle center.",5,,
55,0.97,390.623,394.16,"We got air permits in record time, less than 11 months start to finish.",5,,
56,0.97,394.16,394.66,And Underdevelopment.,5,,
57,0.97,394.66,399.832,So thank you and urge your support for his reappointment.,5,,

60,0.97,405.438,415.448,I am here today to ask for major Sdci reform.,7,,
61,0.97,415.448,417.65,Transparency and public accountability review system is at an all-time low.,7,,
62,0.97,417.65,419.452,The public is being cut out of the process.,7,,
63,0.97,419.452,432.465,Early design outreach is about to be checked by developers and has not been resulted in cooperation with the community Stakeholders.,7,,
64,0.97,432.465,435.535,Director Nathan Torgelson receive that feedback last May and said he would report back.,7,,
65,0.97,435.535,437.17,I like and with the findings were for that.,7,,
66,0.97,437.17,441.44,"Meanwhile Othello which we know is being worked on continues to be hard for all users, not just the public.",7,,
67,0.97,441.44,457.456,Staff has failed to post key project documents to the portal until months after submissions leaving the public in the dark about the status and unable to make timely comments that would result in positive changes to the community.,7,,
68,0.97,457.456,476.409,"Finally at a time were Seattle streets are crushed by congestion, and Offstreet parking is being converted to bus and bike lanes, Sdci announced a directors role would be in place by the end of 2019 requiring that huge Mixed- use towers of the thousand people and more would require a loading birth and trash the wooden block alleys.",7,,
69,0.97,476.409,479.011,They were replaced and then it was taken away.,7,,
70,0.97,479.011,481.814,There has been no new Timeline and when that will be enacted if at all.,7,,
71,0.97,481.814,485.618,I have nothing against Nathan Torgelson.,7,,
72,0.97,485.618,489.522,He is a fine man and working hard.,7,,
73,0.97,489.522,492.191,But when questioned on these matters he provides little response and no action.,7,,
74,0.97,492.191,497.497,Have read his answers to Council questions and they don't address any of the issues I have raised here.,7,,
75,0.97,497.497,501.534,"My question is, how will anything change under the leadership going forward?",7,,
76,0.97,501.534,505.004,Thank you.,8,,

80,0.97,514.814,528.928,As you consider Nathan Torgelson's reappointment I would like to share what I have learned in the last 2.5 years of reviewing around 70 major applications and reading over 1000 Sdci staff Email.,9,,
81,0.97,528.928,556.789,"After my review I can say that Nathan Torgelson's description of Department problems including permitting delays, staff shortages, stress and turnover, developer pressure, document Upload errors, the Othello debacle, incomplete correction notices, etc., are mostly covered in the questionnaire answers.",9,,
82,0.97,556.789,583.616,"These problems have led to a Dysfunction work environment that is perfectly illustrated by an especially troubling Email from a Land-Use planning supervisor who said ""There appears to be inconsistency between what the codes require and what zoning reviewers are Seattle asked to do by some supervisors.",9,,
83,0.97,583.616,589.689,Please investigate this and make them work not just for the developers but the residence.,9,,
84,0.97,589.689,609.742,"In his answer to question number 1 where he says his role is to keep our Department functioning at a high level while staying true to our purpose statement in helping people build a safe little and inclusive Seattle, for residents of downtown, Sdci has not been functioning at a high level for years.",9,,
85,0.97,609.742,624.023,Unfortunately under Mr. Nathan Torgelson's watch residents that try to make things better have come to the conclusion that Mr. Nathan Torgelson's main job is to keep the developers happy.,9,,
86,0.97,624.023,626.058,Please listen to Seattle's residence.,9,,
87,0.97,626.058,631.964,They provide valuable input and are very frustrated when it's dismissed.,9,,

94,0.97,656.288,667.5,My organization has come to believe that during his tenure the public process has been covered by a design review made up of only those was so invested interest.,12,,
95,0.97,667.5,682.515,"'s failure to manage staff shortages, giving developers what appears to be a blank check in the permit process.",12,,
96,0.97,682.515,691.223,"Also, failure to maintain and update the many codes written procedures and directors rules.",12,,
97,0.97,691.223,712.545,"He also has ignored, which is troubling, Uw's traffic lab and Sdot issues of delivering and loading studies.",12,,
98,0.97,712.545,717.116,"One big, big problem we have is, we have stuff we have to stop putting the cart before the horse.",12,,
99,0.97,717.116,724.523,"Meaning, concerns are on the table before design review is a development.",12,,
100,0.97,724.523,725.324,Thank you.,12,,
101,0.97,725.324,731.664,"Up next is Alicia, Gordon and then Colin.",13,,

108,0.97,762.761,768.3,"Like I said, he always comes to the table to listen to several of our members.",14,,
109,0.97,768.3,782.481,And more importantly he always personally attends certain meetings and I think that sends a strong message to staff that housing Affordability is a big priority to the city and we thank them for that.,14,,

121,0.97,832.031,843.175,"Currently I have observed a Disconnect within Sdci departments in between, for example Sdci and Sdot.",18,,
122,0.97,843.175,846.045,Good design and desirable solutions are lost without good communication.,18,,
123,0.97,846.045,869.902,"My goal in designing any project is to keep the developer focused on the intent of the codes, ordinances and guidelines . My experience has been that developers often try to play one Department off against another . an example would be, a declaration by the developer that Sdot won't allow something.",18,,
124,0.97,869.902,871.604,A statement that is not true.,18,,
125,0.97,871.604,891.924,With a steady increase in large developments the need for clarity has never been more important . responsibility to the city of neighborhoods dictates that we work together to help each project fit into the fabric of our community.,18,,

134,0.97,925.057,947.212,"And I will say that Nathan's leadership in Sdci and with his leadership team and staff, to help affordable housing projects move through the permitting process and really come Online as quickly as possible to address our Affordability crisis in Seattle is exemplary.",20,,
135,0.97,947.212,954.82,On two recent projects we issued challenges to our design team and looked to Nathan's Department to permit those projects as quickly as possible.,20,,
136,0.97,954.82,960.993,"And on both, the staff worked quickly and diligently.",20,,

141,0.97,980.312,984.183,They looked at our first cycle in five weeks.,20,,
142,0.97,984.183,997.129,"Not only does he simplify a lot of the city's commitment to affordable housing, but he works with his team to actually make that happen.",20,,
143,0.97,997.129,999.198,I would urge the Council to support reappointment of Nathan.,20,,

150,0.97,1004.103,1021.353,I had a fun trip on the bus where I learned most of Seattle's viewers are all disabled because they were sitting in the seats for people with disabilities and they Ertainly weren't seniors.,22,,
151,0.97,1021.353,1024.156,That is just part of the new Seattle and it's not your responsibility.,22,,
152,0.97,1024.156,1027.192,What I would like to talk about here is more your responsibility.,22,,
153,0.97,1027.192,1034.466,I don't see any action towards looking at the 50-50 that was supposed to be in Mha.,22,,
154,0.97,1034.466,1058.524,"Mha was sold as a promise that 50% of those low, low bargain rates, that many of the stupid citizens said were too darn low, and in the North end or at least the area of town I live in Fremont, I see very few people actually putting the units below market.",22,,
155,0.97,1058.524,1061.994,In the neighborhood.,22,,
156,0.97,1061.994,1064.797,"I think this is very, very important.",22,,
157,0.97,1064.797,1082.114,"The previous members of this counseling Committee, of which I think I attended more meetings that all of you Land-Use in the last couple of months combined, it's very important to take a look at what the promise is and what is being done.",22,,
158,0.97,1082.114,1089.288,I think many people have listed some of the problems with the city and we have many of them in Land-Use.,22,,

160,0.97,1090.022,1094.226,"We are getting, we talk about diversity, it's becoming a lighter shade of pale.",22,,
161,0.97,1094.226,1110.542,"I can't just hold Mr. Nathan Torgelson responsible for that because unlike some people believe the democracy runs the city, I think the elected people run the city.",22,,
162,0.97,1110.542,1113.345,"I have seen many times when elected people make decisions, apartments turn very quickly.",22,,
163,0.97,1113.345,1114.98,They understand who is in charge.,22,,
164,0.97,1114.98,1126.558,"So, for many things I will more hold the elected, the people before you here, and now you have a chance to improve that situation.",22,,

225,0.97,1465.997,1467.599,Would you like us to ask questions?,28,,
226,0.97,1467.599,1476.107,I want to say I am humbled that Mayor Durkan has submitted my name for Renomination as director of the Seattle Department of construction and inspections.,29,,
227,0.97,1476.107,1478.109,And I welcome your questions.,29,,
228,0.97,1478.109,1488.753,I appreciate the responses you provided for long list of questions.,30,,
229,0.97,1488.753,1489.754,I know we had a longer list we pared down.,30,,
230,0.97,1489.754,1494.626,I speaks to the importance of your role as we transition from the town we have been into a global city.,30,,
231,0.97,1494.626,1501.733,"Change is never hard, I've been personally distraught to watch the neighborhood I grew up in Bulldozed.",30,,
232,0.97,1501.733,1505.604,And there's a lot of benefit the comes as well.,30,,
233,0.97,1505.604,1509.241,Much more vibrant market street in downtown Ballard.,30,,
234,0.97,1509.241,1529.361,"Regarding permitting, in your answers to questions number 3 and number 4, you mentioned staff members hired to address the Backlogs, have you seen improvements from additional staff and you believe this is sufficient to address the Backlogs?",30,,
235,0.97,1529.361,1531.963,The 13 positions were under contingent budget authority.,31,,
236,0.97,1531.963,1539.671,They are term limited positions.,31,,
237,0.97,1539.671,1543.642,The majority of those positions were in zoning review where we were seeing the majority of the backlog.,31,,
238,0.97,1543.642,1547.245,We have definitely seen improvements in the master use permits for smaller and medium size projects.,31,,
239,0.97,1547.245,1558.39,"Still, we still have work to do on the more complex projects, but of course those are in the system longer.",31,,
240,0.97,1558.39,1563.695,"I am confident that as the new complex permit projects come in, we will see much faster Timelines.",31,,
241,0.97,1563.695,1599.931,"The great thing about the contingent budget authority positions is as you have staff turnover, retiring, taking new jobs, the people in those positions are well positioned to take those permanent positions and if at the end of the three-year contingent budget authority Timeline, we find you still need the extra staff, we can certainly ask the Mayor's office to hire additional contingent budget authority staff or continue those positions.",31,,
242,0.97,1599.931,1603.702,Of course at any time we can come to Council for authority to hire new permanent staff.,31,,
243,0.97,1603.702,1613.244,"It's always a bit of caution, we have been talking for years about the economy slowing down.",32,,
244,0.97,1613.244,1614.045,We haven't seen that.,32,,
245,0.97,1614.045,1616.081,So we have to track the economy carefully.,32,,
246,0.97,1616.081,1616.715,Thank you.,33,,
247,0.97,1616.715,1618.95,I have other questions.,33,,
248,0.97,1618.95,1621.152,I will defer to other Council members.,33,,
249,0.97,1621.152,1623.421,If anyone else would like to jump in.,33,,
250,0.97,1623.421,1624.823,I do have some questions.,34,,
251,0.97,1624.823,1628.259,That I'm okay with waiting.,34,,
252,0.97,1628.259,1630.128,Go for it.,35,,
253,0.97,1630.128,1631.93,I will jump in.,36,,
254,0.97,1631.93,1636.501,Thank you so much for coming here and joining us at the table.,36,,
255,0.97,1636.501,1651.316,I appreciate our interactions during my first month and,36,,
256,0.97,2058.423,2064.762,The vacant room.,37,,
257,0.97,2064.762,2071.269,"To put up a few partitions between the walls, I know sometimes that can be cost prohibitive to small business owners or Childcare providers.",37,,
258,0.97,2071.269,2073.271,Is that similar for Childcare as well?,37,,
259,0.97,2073.271,2080.011,Correct.,38,,
260,0.97,2080.011,2086.117,We've helped our artist oriented cities.,38,,
261,0.97,2086.117,2099.297,My last question relates to expediting the process for known construction projects that are using Union labor.,39,,
262,0.97,2099.297,2106.003,We have seen this in Austin Texas?,39,,
263,0.97,2106.003,2117.348,Is there a way to expedite the process so more construction can happen before an economic downturn happens in before it's more costly for folks to build later on?,39,,
264,0.97,2117.348,2120.017,I think that is a great question.,40,,
265,0.97,2120.017,2121.452,Thank you.,41,,
266,0.97,2121.452,2143.608,"In the past history, of Sdci and Dpd we did allow applicants to pay staff overtime to expedite permits . We have actually discontinued that practice because it favored people who were able to afford to pay more to expedite those permits.",41,,
267,0.97,2143.608,2150.481,"Again, we can't expedite all permits because no permits would be expedited.",41,,
268,0.97,2150.481,2166.497,"We have really focused on affordable housing and now looking at middle income housing, as far as labor back to construction projects that was a discussion we would need to have with Council and how that might work.",41,,
269,0.97,2166.497,2170.968,We will share with you what we learn from our friends in Austin.,42,,
270,0.97,2170.968,2190.588,I don't love the concept of paying to get first in line but I do understand we have a lot of folks who want to expedite that process who have strong safety standards and have been through the process before but are still on the same Timeframe.,43,,
271,0.97,2190.588,2191.322,That is frustrating.,43,,
272,0.97,2191.322,2192.723,Excellent questions.,44,,
273,0.97,2192.723,2197.195,Thank you chair and director and deputy Mayor for being here.,45,,
274,0.97,2197.195,2202.433,I appreciate your two decades of service to our city.,45,,
275,0.97,2202.433,2218.816,"You have been dealing with the huge moment volume of permits, amazing to get through that volume of permits with a limited staff and I am heartened to hear the positive Estimonials from Plymouth housing and mercy housing in terms of Prioritizing affordable housing.",45,,
276,0.97,2218.816,2233.564,I look forward to additional focus on affordable housing . I also appreciate the renewed focus on small businesses.,45,,
277,0.97,2233.564,2236.133,I also have some questions and concerns I received from constituents.,45,,
278,0.97,2236.133,2237.635,I will ask some of those now.,45,,
279,0.97,2237.635,2245.576,And I appreciate you answering all the questions you received.,45,,
280,0.97,2245.576,2247.578,I'm still frankly working my way through the answers.,45,,
281,0.97,2247.578,2249.38,I may need more time to get through those.,45,,
282,0.97,2249.38,2252.683,Let me just ask a couple of clarifying questions now.,45,,
283,0.97,2252.683,2260.491,They focus on monitoring and reporting on the mandatory housing Affordability.,45,,
284,0.97,2260.491,2261.993,Also economic displacement.,45,,
285,0.97,2261.993,2264.795,And then talking about the tree ordinance.,45,,
286,0.97,2264.795,2278.442,"On Mha, I know the policy goal is to have 50% of the units built on site, the benefits there are economic integration in the neighborhoods, we are bringing those units Online faster.",45,,
287,0.97,2278.442,2284.682,Also benefits in terms of Leveraging additional dollars.,45,,
288,0.97,2284.682,2288.819,Although that happens later.,45,,
289,0.97,2288.819,2292.49,Sort of the balancing which is probably why the previous Council settled on a 50-50 split.,45,,
290,0.97,2292.49,2308.205,"What is being done to monitor that, when developers apply for a permit, they indicate whether they are going to pay in lieu?",45,,
291,0.97,2308.205,2309.106,That is correct.,46,,
292,0.97,2309.106,2310.141,We do annual reporting on Mha.,46,,
293,0.97,2310.141,2311.876,Mha has not been in effect that long.,46,,
294,0.97,2311.876,2317.915,We are happy to provide that information to Council and we have a tally of how many units are being created on site through performance.,46,,
295,0.97,2317.915,2325.156,"Again, what the dollar amount is that is being funneled into the cities affordable housing refund.",46,,
296,0.97,2325.156,2326.023,You raise a great point.,46,,
297,0.97,2326.023,2335.733,It's good to get affordable units on site and in projects but it's good to be able to leverage those dollars through the affording housing levees funding sources.,46,,
298,0.97,2335.733,2339.036,I think our vantage to both.,46,,
299,0.97,2339.036,2348.546,Are we getting a report on how things are going on a 50-50 split?,47,,
300,0.97,2348.546,2349.78,Other we are achieving that?,47,,
301,0.97,2349.78,2361.092,"I don't remember the exact deadline, but I do know, we are providing information, we also provide information to the city auditor looking at how we are doing on tracking with Mha.",48,,
302,0.97,2361.092,2372.503,"Anecdotally when projects are coming through, at least for my district, every time it is the developers choosing to pay in lieu.",48,,
303,0.97,2372.503,2374.505,I would be surprised if you are anywhere near the 50%.,48,,
304,0.97,2374.505,2380.277,Do you have any early indication or preview for us on that?,48,,
305,0.97,2380.277,2385.316,I don't have a number on the top of my head but certainly we are getting more people pay a fee in lieu of.,49,,
306,0.97,2385.316,2393.023,"That could also be because commercial projects, obviously if you have a commercial or office project are not providing affordable housing on site.",49,,
307,0.97,2393.023,2397.495,Those developers are also paying a fee.,49,,
308,0.97,2397.495,2398.329,In lieu of.,49,,
309,0.97,2398.329,2402.8,I'd be happy to provide that information to Council members if you are not already getting it on Mha performance.,50,,
310,0.97,2402.8,2416.614,The positive testimonials about expediting the construction of new low-income housing is really helpful to hear that.,51,,
311,0.97,2416.614,2428.859,"One of the concerns I have heard, and have seen this in the University district is a concern over displacement of basically the demolition of naturally occurring affordable housing and that is often replaced by housing that has rents that are higher than housing that was just demolished.",51,,
312,0.97,2428.859,2435.733,"You might get a few more units, but they are not at the rents that are really affordable below market rents.",51,,
313,0.97,2435.733,2444.575,Deviously . How is Sdci tracking the net loss or gain of units?,51,,
314,0.97,2444.575,2445.242,That are affordable?,51,,
315,0.97,2445.242,2453.15,It is difficult for us to track the loss of naturally occurring affordable housing.,52,,
316,0.97,2453.15,2461.926,We are able to track tenants who are displaced who qualify in our tenant relocation program.,52,,
317,0.97,2461.926,2466.163,They have to qualify 50% of median income.,52,,
318,0.97,2466.163,2476.707,And the developer is required to pay 50% along with the city 50% relocation assistance.,52,,
319,0.97,2476.707,2477.908,We are able to track that.,52,,
320,0.97,2477.908,2494.091,"I will say that through Mha and especially the University district and downtown, the number of affordable units that we are able to create through that program will far outstrip the number of units lost because of displacement.",52,,
321,0.97,2494.091,2496.827,You look at the number of new units that have been created.,52,,
322,0.97,2496.827,2509.34,"But if we don't know what the Affordability is of the units we are losing, how do we know, I guess I am struggling, how do we know it's going to be more affordable under the new units?",53,,
323,0.97,2509.34,2514.512,Maybe the number of units will be higher?,54,,
324,0.97,2514.512,2517.248,But we don't know about whether they will be more affordable.,54,,
325,0.97,2517.248,2520.351,You are correct.,55,,
326,0.97,2520.351,2521.552,We don't know for sure.,55,,
327,0.97,2521.552,2550.447,"The naturally occurring affordable housing, we don't have a way to know what the levels are or incomes of the people but we do know that through the Mha dollars the homes being created through that program income qualify and are primarily people at 60% or 30% of median income or below.",55,,
328,0.97,2550.447,2573.804,Thing I heard was to ask that on a annual basis when we receive a list of rents for the units in the building so when they comply with rental housing registration ordinance they provide it and we will know if it's just an idea . or not.,55,,
329,0.97,2573.804,2575.806,You are not the first was suggested that.,56,,
330,0.97,2575.806,2577.675,I think there were some legal challenges with that.,56,,
331,0.97,2577.675,2582.313,And happy to visit that with the law Department.,56,,
332,0.97,2582.313,2584.381,"If you have the tenants names, that might help.",57,,
333,0.97,2584.381,2592.823,"Just the unit and rent for example, or could be Aggregated so at least we know on average, was it more affordable or less affordable.",57,,
334,0.97,2592.823,2604.034,"Tree ordinance, we look forward to getting a new tree ordinance that we can deliberate on here.",57,,
335,0.97,2604.034,2607.137,I'm really hopeful we get that sooner rather than later.,57,,
336,0.97,2607.137,2612.142,Getting it before the budget process this year would be ideal.,57,,
337,0.97,2612.142,2623.354,I don't think that is the current schedule but I just want to flag that that would be ideal to get it sooner rather than later because I know people have been waiting a long time for that.,57,,
338,0.97,2623.354,2625.756,There have been different Iterations of it.,57,,
339,0.97,2625.756,2633.13,"Previous Iterations there were arguments, he didn't really protect trees as strongly as it could.",57,,
340,0.97,2633.13,2634.765,We're looking for that that really protects the trees.,57,,
341,0.97,2634.765,2652.983,"Under existing authority, one of the questions we received, earlier last night or this morning is, if there is an exceptional tree on site, are you able to have the real estate developer make accommodations to save that tree?",57,,
342,0.97,2652.983,2663.994,So that you may be give them additional height so the additional height can work around the tree.,57,,
343,0.97,2663.994,2664.795,We get the benefits.,57,,
344,0.97,2664.795,2671.902,The climate and health benefits of retraining retaining that tree.,57,,
345,0.97,2671.902,2674.571,That was something we were able to do with Councilmember Johnson.,58,,
346,0.97,2674.571,2681.879,"An example in the University district right across from the University heights center, we allowed some additional height and they were able to save a tree.",58,,
347,0.97,2681.879,2687.918,I really appreciate your concern about trees.,58,,
348,0.97,2687.918,2700.13,It's something our Department takes very seriously and we are working closely with the Mayor's office on a new ordinance . I just wanted to mention we have hired two new treat reviewers and we are about to hire a third.,58,,
349,0.97,2700.13,2716.413,We adopted a new director throughout the 2018 and we're doing a much that her job on tracking and collecting penalties and being able to measure the value of a tree when it is illegally cut down.,58,,
350,0.97,2716.413,2722.653,So we are making improvements and we really look forward to working with you on a better ordinance.,58,,
351,0.97,2722.653,2730.627,One of the issues that was raised by public comment was requiring Arborists licenses that are taking down the trees.,59,,
352,0.97,2730.761,2733.664,That is a question we're looking at.,60,,
353,0.97,2733.664,2735.766,I'm aware of Sdot's process.,60,,
354,0.97,2735.766,2737.468,Thank you.,61,,
355,0.97,2737.468,2773.67,"I think what you are hearing from us is a strong desire for innovation in for an early heads up on some of the strategies you may need to both build affordable housing, create green space, setbacks, we have put so many policies in place now and we are really looking to your advice in the community's advice to help advance those policies so they can be implemented and we are not just in the policy generating mode which we have been in with Mha for the past few years due to some Auditory litigation that happened.",61,,
356,0.97,2773.67,2774.905,Now we get the Go-Ahead.,61,,
357,0.97,2774.905,2786.483,We are looking forward is for you to help us identify ways to help your Department so we are not Mired in long wait times and hearing from constituents about concerns.,61,,
358,0.97,2786.483,2792.923,It sounds like everything from additional green space two ways to expedite affordable housing.,61,,
359,0.97,2792.923,2795.425,Give us an early heads up on how we can help you.,61,,
360,0.97,2795.425,2805.736,One of the things I would love to hear more about is the architect involvement.,61,,
361,0.97,2805.736,2826.924,"There has been coverage in the media recently about our city, perhaps if it's more appropriate to do follow-up conversations with the mayors office I can do that, I am concerned about Uncompensated labor for architects being asked to provide D-Backs and volunteer their time for the model.",61,,
362,0.97,2826.924,2829.159,That is not for example with the city of lacey does.,61,,
363,0.97,2829.159,2845.776,"There was a good article recently in February, it talks about how this is a great policy, but not a great people Mentation plan to require architects to volunteer their time.",61,,
364,0.97,2845.776,2849.58,Can you talk more about any strategies to bring on architects to compensate them for their time?,61,,
365,0.97,2849.58,2858.388,Councilmember Mosqueda is referring to the city's desire to promote more detached accessory dwelling units.,62,,
366,0.97,2858.388,2874.805,"The Office of planning and community element in the Seattle Department of construction issued a call out to the design community for standard plans, more like a design competition.",62,,
367,0.97,2874.805,2889.219,I am aware of that concern from some of the design community that I will say we received over 150 Submittals . So definitely a desire for the design community to participate in that process.,62,,
368,0.97,2889.219,2891.088,We are going to have to narrow that down.,62,,
369,0.97,2891.088,2893.123,I don't know exactly how many will be chosen.,62,,
370,0.97,2893.123,2894.725,It might be around 10.,62,,
371,0.97,2894.725,2901.231,But architects that are chosen will be compensated for the process as far as how many times that plan is selected.,62,,
372,0.97,2901.231,2904.902,Thank you.,63,,
373,0.97,2904.902,2925.022,"I also wanted to add, innovation, one of my priorities has been to Prioritize innovative type housing, tall timber buildings, we have new state building code Council regulations that allow those buildings to go up to 12 or 18 stories.",64,,
374,0.97,2925.022,2933.73,There is sustainable living innovations which is panelized construction that can be done much faster and at less cost.,64,,
375,0.97,2933.73,2939.836,There is a project in the University district used that methods of technology.,64,,
376,0.97,2939.836,2943.907,I think it was called 42 and two.,64,,
377,0.97,2943.907,2946.576,I can't remember the exact name.,64,,
378,0.97,2946.576,2953.35,"The project mentioned earlier in testimony, we have been promoting modular construction as well.",64,,
379,0.97,2953.35,2961.558,"These are all innovative ways of construction, less expensive and can be built much faster.",64,,
380,0.97,2961.558,2962.392,Councilmember Louis.,65,,
381,0.97,2962.392,2968.899,I have a quick follow-up question on the cross laminated timber piece.,66,,
382,0.97,2968.899,2980.877,"Just for clarification, do the new state guidelines require any municipal code changes or building code changes on our end?",66,,
383,0.97,2980.877,2982.279,Or is the Department good to go?,66,,
384,0.97,2982.279,2983.313,It's good to go?,67,,
385,0.97,2983.313,2983.714,Excellent.,67,,
386,0.97,2983.714,2991.021,We might have to make some slight Tweaks because it's been adopted in the state building code we can process those permits.,68,,
387,0.97,2991.021,2992.422,I wanted to clarify that.,69,,
388,0.97,2992.422,2993.89,I have another question.,69,,
389,0.97,2993.89,2996.326,I haven't even gotten to my question.,70,,
390,0.97,2996.326,3003.0,"Likely folks at the table, Councilmember Pedersen asked my question about trees.",70,,
391,0.97,3003.0,3004.835,Councilmember Mosqueda asked my question about innovation.,70,,
392,0.97,3004.835,3009.039,So I will take one more question because I have a couple as well.,70,,
393,0.97,3009.039,3012.342,Great.,71,,
394,0.97,3012.342,3016.213,I'm going to change the topic a little bit to talk about alleys.,71,,
395,0.97,3016.213,3024.554,"This is a particular concern to a lot of constituents in district 7 who live downtown, concern about congestion in alleys.",71,,
396,0.97,3024.554,3036.099,A legislation intent asking the Department to work with Sdot on strategies to reduce and mitigate congestion in our growing downtown.,71,,
397,0.97,3036.099,3045.475,I'm wondering if you can give an update to the Committee on where we are with that and what your plans are going forward and your next turn to focus on mitigating the impact.,71,,
398,0.97,3045.475,3049.045,"This was referred to in public testimony, we are a little behind.",72,,
399,0.97,3049.045,3051.548,But new regulations and the director's role is coming.,72,,
400,0.97,3051.548,3067.798,"Have certainly seen in the age of E-Commerce a lot more deliveries to residential properties . Historically we have thought of deliveries to commercial properties, but now we are seeing a lot to both kinds of properties.",72,,
401,0.97,3067.798,3078.708,We are working closely with Sdot and utilities looking at how we can improve access to loading bays and how many loading bays should be required.,72,,
402,0.97,3078.708,3084.014,Looking at solid waste storage and access within multifamily buildings.,72,,
403,0.97,3084.014,3091.521,We have been meeting with both residential groups and businesses about the requirements.,72,,
404,0.97,3091.521,3111.708,"So look for a directors rule helpfully residential loading downtown and an ordinance later this year that looks at access space, but also looks at the issue of solid waste access within multifamily buildings.",72,,
405,0.97,3111.708,3123.854,This is a complex issue where some people have concerns because requiring access to garbage and solid waste on every floor in multifamily buildings take away one unit.,72,,
406,0.97,3123.854,3130.76,But we know that people are more likely to recycle if they have easier access to those facilities.,72,,
407,0.97,3130.76,3132.362,It is a compromise.,72,,
408,0.97,3132.362,3137.868,Look for that directors rule soon.,72,,
409,0.97,3137.868,3139.669,Have a quick follow-up.,73,,
410,0.97,3139.669,3169.099,"I appreciate your answer, director, but it just goes back to, you talked about some of the outreach and feedback, I have just heard a lot of, I've heard a lot of criticism from some folks organizing residence in the downtown core that are concerned about this and don't think the Department has been as Proactive as it could be or that their concerns are being incorporated.",73,,
411,0.97,3169.099,3172.002,But it sounds like there is going to be a rule coming out in April.,73,,
412,0.97,3172.002,3179.709,"My request going forward would be what are some of the strategies over the next four years to make sure those folks feel like they are being consulted, included, part of the process.",73,,
413,0.97,3179.709,3185.448,Right now there is a concern that their concerns are being taken seriously.,73,,
414,0.97,3185.448,3193.29,I want to make sure going forward we are doing everything we can to keep them in the Loop on this and legitimately incorporate the feedback.,73,,
415,0.97,3193.29,3195.125,I appreciate that comment.,74,,
416,0.97,3195.125,3221.718,"I think when the draft directors rule comes out there is an opportunity for directors and residents to comment on that and we can, as necessary, if there are suggestions that lead to improvements, the proof is still in the Pudding when that director's rule comes out.",74,,
417,0.97,3221.718,3227.457,Councilmember Lewis you asked one question I had on deck.,75,,
418,0.97,3227.457,3228.625,I appreciate that.,75,,
419,0.97,3228.625,3238.435,The integral Department team that created this report are both budget Provisos of the state of legislative intent.,75,,
420,0.97,3238.435,3245.742,This is a very important issue to me as well.,75,,
421,0.97,3245.742,3247.577,Councilmember Pedersen I see you have one final question.,75,,
422,0.97,3247.577,3248.979,You mentioned modular housing.,76,,
423,0.97,3248.979,3253.85,I was in Vancouver and saw modular housing there for formally homeless people.,76,,
424,0.97,3253.85,3256.286,It looks like an apartment building.,76,,
425,0.97,3256.286,3263.56,"I wanted to clarify, are those rules in place already, that we can have modular housing?",76,,
426,0.97,3263.56,3267.063,,77,,
427,0.97,3267.063,3279.876,"I was able to attend the demonstration, this was a project right off of Aurora and North 96 south of the cemetery where we got to see the modular units being lifted and put into place.",78,,
428,0.97,3279.876,3280.71,It is pretty amazing.,78,,
429,0.97,3280.71,3284.314,"That his apartment buildings, okay.",79,,
430,0.97,3284.314,3284.914,Thank you.,79,,
431,0.97,3284.914,3287.984,Last question is about trees again.,79,,
432,0.97,3287.984,3301.331,"I just wanted to understand, if a tree is being taken down, what do residents who might be concerned, if they want to confirm this was authorized, what do citizens do?",79,,
433,0.97,3301.331,3307.404,They call our Department and we respond.,80,,
434,0.97,3307.404,3314.611,"They write letters . and in some cases, it is legal to take down the tree.",80,,
435,0.97,3314.611,3317.247,"And in other circumstances, it is not legal.",80,,
436,0.97,3317.247,3330.093,"We had a case in West Seattle last year where an exceptional tree was taken down in the middle of the night and it preceded a future development proposal I believe we were able to collect $11,000 as a penalty.",80,,
437,0.97,3330.093,3334.064,That was a pretty egregious example.,80,,
438,0.97,3334.064,3336.933,That was an exceptional tree.,80,,
439,0.97,3336.933,3339.069,Do you have any final questions?,81,,
440,0.97,3339.069,3342.038,I will keep my short.,82,,
441,0.97,3342.038,3344.24,Especially because my colleagues have asked many.,82,,
442,0.97,3344.24,3358.288,"On page 3 of your answers to Council questions, you mentioned building monitoring program and specifically Referenced Demolitions that Sdci authorized.",82,,
443,0.97,3358.288,3364.16,You know how many emergency Demolitions were authorized and was there a common factor in these cases?,82,,
444,0.97,3364.16,3382.011,The reason I ask is we have a number of vacant or problematic lots throughout the city the need to have action taken to work with Councilmember Bagshaw and condemnation of a lot here in the city.,82,,
445,0.97,3382.011,3383.88,I like to hear what you have to say.,82,,
446,0.97,3383.88,3386.916,I want to thank Council for their support for vacant building monitoring.,83,,
447,0.97,3386.916,3395.625,We have a much more sophisticated and technologically savvy way to track those vacant buildings now.,83,,
448,0.97,3395.625,3410.24,"As a city, we meet regularly, police, fire, FAS, to look through the vacant building a Inglis list to find ways we can work better.",83,,
449,0.97,3410.24,3426.122,"I have in my term as director for the past four years, I've issued seven emergency Demolitions for buildings . In this case, I have to waive Sepa regulations typically because of an emergency situation.",83,,
450,0.97,3426.122,3444.04,"It is kind of on a case-by-case basis, usually the situation is so dire with legal activity, illegal happy get illegal activity happening Hazmat issues, that it's really in the public interest to go ahead and allow demolition.",83,,
451,0.97,3444.04,3451.281,In that case the project proponent is usually waiting for a permit from our Department.,83,,
452,0.97,3451.281,3452.382,Is going through the review process.,83,,
453,0.97,3452.382,3453.583,And they have a vacant welding.,83,,
454,0.97,3453.583,3461.057,In order for us to do that we have to have a willing holding owner or project proponent who does want to Demo the building.,83,,
455,0.97,3461.057,3473.87,"When we have a building that is vacant and we have sort of an absent landlord not doing anything, it's a little more complicated.",83,,
456,0.97,3473.87,3478.107,In some cases we can order the demolition of the building but we have to go through a complex legal process.,83,,
457,0.97,3478.107,3478.908,Thank you.,84,,
458,0.97,3478.908,3485.615,I appreciate my colleagues asking all the hard questions so I can have the easy role.,84,,
459,0.97,3485.615,3491.521,"I last question to you today, just to give you the floor, what are your major goals for Sdci with this appointment?",84,,
460,0.97,3491.521,3504.334,I look forward to the Mayor's executive order permitting and helping to implement those actions . We need to continue to work on housing production in the city.,85,,
461,0.97,3504.334,3509.606,The demand for housing is far outstripping the supply coming Online.,85,,
462,0.97,3509.606,3511.641,That is a huge priority.,85,,
463,0.97,3511.641,3520.55,"Working with the small business community, again working on a new tree ordinance is a huge priority for the Mayor and for our Department.",85,,
464,0.97,3520.55,3526.823,Everything we do is under the umbrella of social justice.,85,,
465,0.97,3526.823,3538.067,We know not everyone has the Wherewithal to come down to the Seattle Miscible tower or city council chambers or to higher a Land-Use attorney.,85,,
466,0.97,3538.067,3549.979,One thing I am really proud of is our Department every year sponsors two home fares in the community . This past year we had one at the Filipino community center.,85,,
467,0.97,3549.979,3551.347,Also at the Meadowbrook community center.,85,,
468,0.97,3551.347,3558.554,We have multiple staff from all facets of our business and other city departments.,85,,
469,0.97,3558.554,3561.457,Numbers of the public can come in and ask questions at their leisure.,85,,
470,0.97,3561.457,3562.191,Those are great events.,85,,
471,0.97,3562.191,3566.062,"Another priority is, Unreinforced masonry buildings.",86,,
472,0.97,3566.062,3574.604,We are now working with Council on a joint resolution so the program can move forward on that.,86,,
473,0.97,3574.604,3575.805,And very excited about that.,86,,
474,0.97,3575.805,3578.007,That is a huge issue in our city.,86,,
475,0.97,3578.007,3583.513,"Again, I mentioned, just figuring out ways to promote innovative housing in our city.",86,,
476,0.97,3583.646,3584.314,Wonderful.,87,,
477,0.97,3584.314,3584.714,Thank you.,87,,
478,0.97,3584.714,3594.624,If you are doing outreach at the Meadowbrook I also suggest Lake City it's nearby and very different.,87,,
479,0.97,3594.624,3596.526,We will consider that for next year.,88,,
480,0.97,3596.526,3598.528,We tend to change locations.,88,,
481,0.97,3598.528,3599.629,That's fair.,89,,
482,0.97,3599.629,3603.433,Any further comments?,89,,
483,0.97,3603.433,3604.5,Thank you so much.,89,,

513,0.97,3742.171,3750.546,"I am Sarah, I am the city historic preservation officer.",98,,
514,0.97,3750.546,3751.848,Sarah Sodt.,98,,
515,0.97,3751.848,3754.383,Good morning.,99,,
516,0.97,3754.383,3759.655,"I am Julie Blakeslee, diversity of Washington environmental planner.",99,,
517,0.97,3759.655,3770.8,"I am richer Richard Rogers, I'm here representing the ownership of the buildings.",100,,
518,0.97,3770.8,3779.575,It seems we have over Presenters for this item and the next item.,101,,
519,0.97,3779.575,3786.015,"For those who joined us at the table for the next item on the agenda, please hang tight and we will get to you in just a minute.",101,,
520,0.97,3786.015,3790.319,I understand lance Neely was unable to attend.,101,,
521,0.97,3790.319,3792.054,Would you remind us of his background?,101,,
522,0.97,3792.054,3802.098,I can also give you some additional information about Dean Barnes unless you'd like to ask him questions directly.,102,,
523,0.97,3802.098,3803.566,Lance Neely is a real estate broker.,102,,
524,0.97,3803.566,3805.935,He holds a bachelor of Arts in sociology.,102,,
525,0.97,3805.935,3808.204,And a master of Arts in clinical psychology.,102,,
526,0.97,3808.204,3816.245,He is a proprietor of a residential real estate firm here in Seattle with a focus on historic homes.,102,,
527,0.97,3816.245,3820.349,Wonderful.,103,,
528,0.97,3820.349,3832.562,To my colleagues at the table have questions to get it started?,103,,
529,0.97,3832.562,3832.962,Questions?,103,,
530,0.97,3832.962,3842.271,"Dean, do you have, you made some remarks, do you have anything?",103,,
531,0.97,3842.271,3844.14,"Sure, I can talk a little bit.",104,,
532,0.97,3844.14,3845.374,That would be great.,105,,
533,0.97,3845.374,3853.082,"If you look at my packet, most of my experiences been either in finance and accounting human resources.",106,,
534,0.97,3853.082,3861.791,"And so when you look at the landmarks Commission, that seems a little different than someone who might have a construction background or architecture background.",106,,
535,0.97,3861.791,3871.4,"My interst has been a historian in that I love to read the history, particularly about Seattle and the Seattle community.",106,,
536,0.97,3871.4,3874.604,I've been in Seattle for almost 50 years.,106,,
537,0.97,3874.604,3883.112,"For example, when I first moved to Seattle if you look at where the space needle is compared to where Smith tower is, at that time there was nothing in between.",106,,
538,0.97,3883.112,3887.216,To see the construction has occurred is tremendous.,106,,
539,0.97,3887.216,3897.793,"One of the things I was always interested in was watching construction and at the same time looking at, what is it doing to the city itself?",106,,
540,0.97,3897.793,3899.328,How is it changing the culture?,106,,
541,0.97,3899.328,3906.736,"We have issues in terms of homelessness in building housing and such, Seattle is relatively young city.",106,,
542,0.97,3906.736,3910.072,There is this idea of let's tear this down and build a backup.,106,,
543,0.97,3910.072,3920.116,"At the same time we like to see the landmark Commission look at what we can do to maintain the culture of the city, the character of the city.",106,,
544,0.97,3920.116,3921.951,Think that is one thing that is important.,106,,
545,0.97,3921.951,3934.196,"Particularly when you look at some of the older buildings that have architecture in the outside Moldings they have, I'd like to see some of that remain.",106,,
546,0.97,3934.196,3937.767,So we don't tear all buildings down.,106,,
547,0.97,3937.767,3944.54,Another part I'm concerned about is we want to make sure we have the landmarks that are important to the communities of color.,106,,
548,0.97,3944.54,3955.051,There has been a history of those being torn down first because they don't have the voice to back that.,106,,
549,0.97,3955.051,3960.89,I'd like to maintain the Commission has the opportunity to maintain those as part of the community as well.,106,,
550,0.97,3960.89,3964.794,Wonderful.,107,,
551,0.97,3964.794,3969.498,That is a great perspective and you have an extensive history working throughout the country.,107,,
552,0.97,3969.498,3973.102,In a number of different human resources departments.,107,,
553,0.97,3973.102,3977.807,I they also you worked for Seattle housing authority.,107,,
554,0.97,3977.807,3985.715,In what perspective can you bring to the preservation board that also assists us in developing more affordable housing?,107,,
555,0.97,3985.715,3988.284,That's a good question.,108,,
556,0.97,3988.284,4024.053,"I was with housing authority, just before they started the big project, we had high point and the one South, it escapes me, but also to take a look at when you do take a look at for example the terrace, you have the houses built in the 30s, at the time the first integrated public housing process, and to say we are going to take those out, what can we do to maintain the cultural aspect of it.",108,,
557,0.97,4024.053,4035.164,Andrew Lofton and Mr. Turner were Ceos at the time and have done a great job maintaining the character and the cultural aspect is connected to the International district.,108,,
558,0.97,4035.164,4043.572,Those are things the land board Commission could do to be involved in those discussions and maintain those cultural aspects.,108,,
559,0.97,4043.572,4046.475,Wonderful.,109,,
560,0.97,4046.475,4054.784,"What opportunities for the city, do you see for the city to better support historic preservation efforts?",109,,
561,0.97,4054.784,4058.287,What opportunities if any do you see for the city to better support historic preservation efforts?,109,,
562,0.97,4058.287,4088.117,"I think the discussions that are going on, which I'm sure Erin and the staff also, the Rsji issue and also not just in terms of dollar and since but what is it due to the culture of the community, the make of the housing, you mentioned Ballard, look at all the construction going on and you see a lot of houses built in the 1940s and 1950s.",110,,
563,0.97,4088.117,4091.287,Then they have these big box houses the lookout of character within the communities.,110,,
564,0.97,4091.287,4112.641,"The landlord Commission looking at making recommendations on how those are working with the previous Department of construction, make sure we do take a look, when we do but those houses where they going to affect the communities as well?",110,,
565,0.97,4112.775,4118.547,When people are displaced that changes the fabric of our community.,111,,
566,0.97,4118.547,4119.148,Vice chair?,111,,
567,0.97,4119.148,4121.016,I'm interested in your background on housing.,112,,
568,0.97,4121.016,4125.654,I think one of the comments we hear a lot is that these big boxes are displacing individuals who live there.,112,,
569,0.97,4125.654,4143.772,"However living in a box that is a Townhouse now living in one of four townhouses in a plot that used to just have one house, one thing I think we should try to do in evaluating the benefits of potential construction is what makes the character of the neighborhood and that is the people.",112,,
570,0.97,4143.772,4146.442,"And the more people, the more character and culture we have.",112,,
571,0.97,4146.442,4156.152,"If there is a way to pursue that and help individuals stay in place, live in the community, not get displaced, I think that is the best of both worlds.",112,,
572,0.97,4156.152,4169.498,"Can you talk about what your hope is for how to do preservation and also add new housing, whether it's affordable or mixed income?",112,,
573,0.97,4169.498,4183.812,And strategies you would like to see the landmarks preservation board take on that would potentially preserve the Facde but allow for greater height and Affordability for mixed housing opportunities above it or around it?,112,,
574,0.97,4183.812,4184.38,Excellent question.,113,,
575,0.97,4184.38,4204.7,"I think one of the issues, first thing for me when you talk about that, Advocation of the central area which historically has been the black community ever since I moved here, you go there now, a large number of the people who were my age moved South, can't move back in because they can afford it.",113,,
576,0.97,4204.7,4210.339,The people who were first there when I first came can afford to stay because of the housing.,113,,
577,0.97,4210.339,4210.606,Inc.,113,,
578,0.97,4210.606,4216.445,"About the housing being done, what is it that we are building in that place?",113,,
579,0.97,4216.445,4230.859,"Example used where you build a four Plex, I think that four Plex is an opportunity to look at providing more equitable housing that might not be as expensive as a single dwelling.",113,,
580,0.97,4230.859,4241.47,"I think if I remember correctly, the central area has one of the highest apartment complex ratios, essentially down South to the Ranier beacon Hill area.",113,,
581,0.97,4241.47,4246.342,"Taking a look at, what are we doing to do that?",113,,
582,0.97,4246.342,4260.356,"The other part on the decline is homeownership and one of the things, what can we do to ensure houses that are built are affordable for people to buy as well as to rent?",113,,
583,0.97,4260.356,4272.635,"A quick follow-up, and overall, I hear about the board in the context, more commercial and Mixed-Use.",114,,
584,0.97,4272.635,4277.573,How much of the board's work is directly related to residential versus commercial work?,114,,
585,0.97,4277.573,4284.713,Erin and I can try to answer that together.,115,,
586,0.97,4284.713,4286.782,We do have a lot of large affordable housing projects.,115,,
587,0.97,4286.782,4290.085,One is the mercy housing project.,115,,
588,0.97,4290.085,4300.529,There was also another project in northeast Seattle that was converting the building into housing.,115,,
589,0.97,4300.529,4308.637,"We see a lot of that as well as housing, new construction built as an addition to existing buildings.",115,,
590,0.97,4308.637,4311.94,It is a real mix.,115,,
591,0.97,4311.94,4313.342,Does not just commercial.,115,,
592,0.97,4313.342,4317.646,Do you have a breakdown?,116,,
593,0.97,4317.646,4319.448,Do you have a chart that shows us?,116,,
594,0.97,4319.448,4320.849,I don't think we do.,117,,
595,0.97,4320.849,4326.722,We do have a breakdown of projects that have received special tax evaluations.,117,,
596,0.97,4326.722,4331.627,"And normally, that is one of the incentives for historic preservation.",117,,
597,0.97,4331.627,4335.864,It is usually about 50-50.,117,,
598,0.97,4335.864,4343.238,Mixed use and then commercial.,117,,
599,0.97,4343.238,4344.239,Any further questions.,118,,
600,0.97,4344.239,4346.075,I have one.,119,,
601,0.97,4346.075,4352.981,Please.,120,,
602,0.97,4352.981,4369.598,"One of the things I would like to do, I am excited for your potential continuation in this process because I'm sure it's going to be overwhelming support, one of the things I would love to do is come and visit with the landmarks board.",121,,
603,0.97,4369.598,4381.844,I think one of the frustrations I hear from constituents is that sometimes this process can be viewed as a tool to prevent new kinds of construction that would allow for more people to live in our neighborhood.,121,,
604,0.97,4381.844,4401.73,"I think as we try to create dense living opportunities that allows people to be closer to community centers and place of work, it's an environmental justice issue and a worker justice issue to make sure people can live close to their place of work.",121,,
605,0.97,4401.73,4417.446,"And I don't want us to inadvertently be allowing this process to be used in some cases to prevent construction when it is supposed to do what you said, look for ways to preserve historical sites, cultural sites and for us to think about ways for Mixed-Use sites as buildings are adapted.",121,,
606,0.97,4417.446,4432.761,"I would love to hear what some strategies are the Maybe the board is considering and personally, any thoughts about how to help prevent against the unintended consequence or misuse of the tool when it is before you?",121,,
607,0.97,4432.761,4439.968,"That is the one thing, one of the things I will be learning.",122,,
608,0.97,4439.968,4442.571,"I do have in my mind, what I would like to see done.",122,,
609,0.97,4442.571,4455.551,"In terms about learning about the Commission with the authority and limitations, you mentioned the Mixed-Use complex, at Ranier Vista, a number of construction in that area.",122,,
610,0.97,4455.551,4458.22,At the same time they have the community center and Rec center.,122,,
611,0.97,4458.22,4461.857,The same thing at the terrace.,122,,
612,0.97,4461.857,4482.578,"In addition to the Eso terrace, we also guarantee those individuals come back to the places and we also had a number, I shouldn't say we, Seattle housing had a number of people who at home Daycares.",122,,
613,0.97,4482.578,4483.612,And those were back in their.,122,,
614,0.97,4483.612,4486.014,I think the idea of maintaining those aspects are very important.,122,,
615,0.97,4486.014,4512.441,"I think as we go into the future, I think it is the, I'm trying to remember the name of the street on Ranier, construction where they have a housing and retail on the first floor, those are continually part of that process, around the bus stops, and community center and train stops where they have a lot of congregation, to help people with commuting as well.",122,,
616,0.97,4512.441,4523.986,I think that is a great Segue to some of the work we have been doing last year and will be amplifying this year on our housing as well related to affirmative marketing.,123,,
617,0.97,4523.986,4525.02,And community preference.,123,,
618,0.97,4525.02,4533.362,"To individuals who were previously where construction happens, they can come back first in line.",123,,
619,0.97,4533.362,4544.74,My understanding from Seattle housing authority they have reached 100% of residents who lived there and offered them the ability to come back.,123,,
620,0.97,4544.74,4545.941,Some have created Childcare On- site again.,123,,
621,0.97,4545.941,4561.39,I think that is a great example of how we build housing and in this case a mixed income housing and have Affirmatively worked with the community to make sure the community that was previously there had a preference for coming back and we help them get in.,123,,
622,0.97,4561.39,4563.392,"I think it is a both, and in that example.",123,,
623,0.97,4563.392,4565.661,I couldn't agree more.,124,,
624,0.97,4565.661,4571.533,"Erin, would you share more background about Lance and why you're supporting his reappointment?",124,,
625,0.97,4571.533,4573.769,Of course.,125,,
626,0.97,4573.769,4581.91,"I don't to take us away from that, I want to remind everyone the you asked us to provide an overview of the whole program.",125,,
627,0.97,4581.91,4593.088,We have that as part of our Powerpoint but you don't have it identified as a specific item on the agenda.,125,,
628,0.97,4593.088,4595.29,My understanding is that is in the next item.,126,,
629,0.97,4595.29,4596.325,As a Lead-In.,127,,
630,0.97,4596.325,4596.925,Correct.,128,,
631,0.97,4596.925,4597.326,Rate.,129,,
632,0.97,4597.326,4603.532,I think some of the questions coming up are to the historic district and not just the landmarks board programs.,129,,
633,0.97,4603.532,4614.81,"So, the makeup of the landmarks board, there are 12 volunteer positions.",129,,
634,0.97,4614.81,4616.945,Dean Barnes's position is one of the At-Large.,129,,
635,0.97,4616.945,4622.05,"But lance Neely, we are recommending him for the real estate position.",129,,
636,0.97,4622.05,4632.427,We have had property developers hold this in the past but also real estate agents like lance Neely.,129,,
637,0.97,4632.427,4639.968,His background is in project movement and business services.,129,,
638,0.97,4639.968,4651.98,But he did move into the real estate world in 2014. but he has just embarked this past year on creating his own firm.,129,,
639,0.97,4651.98,4652.981,It is called heritage Realty.,129,,
640,0.97,4652.981,4657.653,He focuses primarily on Single- family homes.,129,,
641,0.97,4657.653,4669.464,He shared with me he has acquired his commercial real estate license he is hoping to break into that market as well.,129,,
642,0.97,4669.464,4679.374,"His perspective would be very interesting, not just architectural character but also interested in cultural history.",129,,
643,0.97,4679.374,4697.826,We are welcoming that experience we also look to the architects on the board and other people who may have experience.,129,,
644,0.97,4697.826,4703.732,Whistle think Dean Barnes may have experience relative to that as well.,129,,
645,0.97,4703.732,4717.345,We also we recognize his interest in history and think it will be in addition to the board as well as lance Neely.,129,,
646,0.97,4717.345,4718.013,Any questions?,130,,
647,0.97,4718.013,4724.653,"Hearing none I would like to move to approve appointments 01497 and 01050, second.",131,,
648,0.97,4724.653,4730.058,"Please, those in favor vote aye and raise your hand.",131,,
649,0.97,4730.058,4735.263,Any opposed?,131,,
650,0.97,4735.263,4736.098,"Hearing none, the motion passes.",131,,
651,0.97,4736.098,4739.734,"Thank you for being here today, Dean, in your will is to serve.",131,,
652,0.97,4739.734,4744.773,"These will be considered a full Council on Monday, March 2.",131,,
653,0.97,4744.773,4753.548,"You are welcome to attend the meeting, you're not required to as is the case with lance Neely as well.",131,,
654,0.97,4753.548,4763.091,"You are free to remain at the table while we go into our next set of presentations, and if you want to feel free to excuse yourself.",131,,
655,0.97,4763.091,4764.493,It was a real pleasure to meet you.,131,,
656,0.97,4764.493,4773.201,Our final two items are the landmarks designating ordinance for Eagles and whole.,131,,
657,0.97,4773.201,4776.304,Presenters have joined us.,131,,
658,0.97,4776.304,4783.378,Please read these into the record and this does include a power point presentation.,131,,
659,0.97,4783.378,4805.734,"Agenda item number 4 Council built 11749, an ordinance relating to historic preservation; imposing controls upon the University of Washington Eagleson hall, a landmark designated by the landmarks preservation board under Chapter 25.12 of the Seattle municipal code, and adding it to the table of historical landmarks contained in Chapter 25.32 of the Seattle municipal code.",131,,
660,0.97,4805.734,4825.02,"And item number 5, and ordinance relating to historic preservation; imposing controls upon the sunset telephone & amp; Telegraph exchange, a landmark designated by the landmarks preservation board under Chapter 25.12 of the Seattle municipal code, and adding it to the table of historical landmarks contained in Chapter 25.32 of the Seattle municipal code.",131,,
661,0.97,4825.02,4826.855,Wonderful.,132,,
662,0.97,4826.855,4830.125,Our Presenters have already introduced themselves.,132,,
663,0.97,4830.125,4834.362,Would you like to just take it away?,132,,
664,0.97,4834.362,4834.763,Sure.,133,,
665,0.97,4834.763,4841.469,I'm going to jump in with a high-level overview of the program and the work we do.,133,,
666,0.97,4841.469,4852.247,The historic preservation program is responsible for the landmark nomination and designation process.,133,,
667,0.97,4852.247,4862.591,Which results in the designating ordinance is you are seeing today and that is where Council comes in.,133,,
668,0.97,4862.591,4873.969,We reviewed certificates of approval for landmarks and historic districts.,133,,
669,0.97,4873.969,4919.247,"Essentially, the certificate of approval is permitting we have code required deadlines we have to review applications 20 days or less, we don't have the benefit of delaying that review process at all, for any subsequent follow-up corrections we have 14 days or less to review those typically we hit 80 to 90% response of 10 days or less on these permit applications.",133,,
670,0.97,4919.247,4923.952,We try to follow the code and beat the deadlines.,133,,
671,0.97,4923.952,4931.059,A big part of that work is with the historic preservation board and Commission coordination.,133,,
672,0.97,4931.059,4936.765,"As you saw today, you did a couple of appointments.",133,,
673,0.97,4936.765,4938.967,That is where the Council INTERSECTS with us.,133,,
674,0.97,4938.967,4943.672,They are almost all Mayoral appointments with Council confirmation.,133,,
675,0.97,4943.672,4947.642,We have eight historic districts.,133,,
676,0.97,4947.642,4952.747,The landmarks board is responsible for four of those.,133,,
677,0.97,4952.747,4972.5,"Columbia city, harbor Belmont, Belmont, Pike place market, Columbia city, and Ballard, sorry not Columbia city, Pinehurst square, all each have their own review committee or board.",133,,
678,0.97,4972.5,4976.171,Commission that oversees and.,133,,
679,0.97,4976.171,4980.408,A question on the Pike place market.,134,,
680,0.97,4980.408,4981.81,Subcommittee?,134,,
681,0.97,4981.81,4984.479,Commission.,135,,
682,0.97,4984.479,4985.313,Commission.,136,,
683,0.97,4985.313,4985.513,Okay.,136,,
684,0.97,4985.513,4991.319,When and how to somebody take up whether or not cars should be able to drive through there?,136,,
685,0.97,4991.453,5001.329,"I don't know that that is going to be the commissions job, because it's really a traffic management issue.",137,,
686,0.97,5001.329,5004.199,And that would be Sdot.,137,,
687,0.97,5004.199,5016.144,Has a Commission for example in Pioneer square ever taken on the question of whether or not there should be traffic cut through so for example in Pioneer square?,138,,
688,0.97,5016.144,5025.12,We honestly don't allow traffic to go through at least two blocks of that neighborhood that I believe is being preserved for historic preservation.,138,,
689,0.97,5025.12,5028.957,Are you talking about Occidental park?,139,,
690,0.97,5028.957,5035.463,I would think that would be similar in Pike place market given the historic brick street that is there.,140,,
691,0.97,5035.463,5048.076,"It's not so much the Materiality, in Occidental Park, it is an unimproved street.",141,,
692,0.97,5048.076,5049.644,So it's not used for traffic.,141,,
693,0.97,5049.644,5055.583,It's Sdot.,142,,
694,0.97,5055.583,5081.376,"I guess my question is, how did traffic ultimately get stopped in that area and if it wasn't the Commission to help make the recommendation, if folks are interested in stopping traffic through Pike place market, which I would be supportive of, it seems like that question doesn't go through the Commission, it would need to go through Sdot.",143,,
695,0.97,5081.376,5083.411,My understanding is it would start with Sdot.,144,,
696,0.97,5083.411,5095.39,"If there any physical changes that result because of that traffic management, the Commission would weigh in on that.",144,,
697,0.97,5095.39,5097.225,I assume it would probably be the reverse.,145,,
698,0.97,5097.225,5101.896,That stopping traffic would help preserve the historic street.,145,,
699,0.97,5101.896,5106.301,I wouldn't say they would be opposed.,146,,
700,0.97,5106.301,5110.104,We will take it up with Sdot.,147,,
701,0.97,5110.238,5118.113,Sorry I was asking a question about where the question might lie if folks are removing traffic in Pike place market.,148,,
702,0.97,5118.113,5120.348,That is a great question.,149,,
703,0.97,5120.348,5134.462,"Something I would support as well as well as a traffic officer, whether private or public at the corner of Western.",149,,
704,0.97,5134.462,5135.43,The four way stop.,149,,
705,0.97,5135.43,5140.468,Just to mention one of the critical pieces to the market is the ability for farmers and vendors to deliver.,150,,
706,0.97,5140.468,5148.576,So there would need to always be some sort of traffic through that area.,150,,
707,0.97,5148.576,5150.645,I think it is important for me to emphasize that.,150,,
708,0.97,5150.645,5168.296,"When we have looked at other examples from Berlin and Copenhagen and Madrid, they have always clarified, in the notes through traffic neighborhoods, vehicles are always permitted.",151,,
709,0.97,5168.296,5172.567,Including potentially people who might live in the neighborhood who have vehicles.,151,,
710,0.97,5172.567,5180.909,That is very different than allowing cars to use it as a cut through.,151,,
711,0.97,5180.909,5184.779,'s I'm happy to have a clarification and just want to make sure we are clear on our end.,151,,
712,0.97,5184.779,5187.282,It would not be to eliminate any delivery or merchant vehicles.,151,,
713,0.97,5187.282,5197.125,I think it is more a matter of safety for residents like us who frequent Pike place market and are also the large tourist community.,151,,
714,0.97,5197.125,5203.031,I support that.,152,,
715,0.97,5203.031,5208.336,The next body of work we have is historic resources survey and inventory.,153,,
716,0.97,5208.336,5216.444,That is a requirement of the Federal historic preservation act.,153,,
717,0.97,5216.444,5226.621,So we maintain our survey inventory as best we can with funding available.,153,,
718,0.97,5226.621,5228.423,It is Online in a Database on a Website.,153,,
719,0.97,5228.423,5250.578,"And, one of the things I hope to continue is to center in doing inventory so we can be better equipped to analyze these resources as Mr. Barnes had mentioned.",153,,
720,0.97,5250.578,5259.087,To make sure we are including everyone's history.,153,,
721,0.97,5259.087,5270.398,Another big workload we have is Sepa and Nepa.,154,,
722,0.97,5270.398,5273.501,St3 is really big right now.,154,,
723,0.97,5273.501,5274.569,State route 20.,154,,
724,0.97,5274.569,5279.774,And Urm work and Unreinforced masonry.,154,,
725,0.97,5279.774,5292.62,"Finally, we have the ability to do, and the support is education and outreach.",154,,
726,0.97,5292.62,5304.232,Two new and exciting things are we have a new Video that highlights the cultural aspects of why historic preservation is important . I can forward that.,154,,
727,0.97,5304.232,5313.941,We also have an education Video that is a tool that shows the nomination and designation process and how community can participate in that.,154,,
728,0.97,5313.941,5318.446,I can forward those both to you.,154,,
729,0.97,5318.579,5321.049,Wonderful.,155,,
730,0.97,5321.049,5324.719,I believe you had one further slide?,155,,
731,0.97,5324.719,5334.128,I just wanted to highlight the hotel which I was able to tour well was under construction.,155,,
732,0.97,5334.128,5340.768,"Only historic preservation included in this building, it was also part of, it provides rent restricted units.",155,,
733,0.97,5340.768,5351.279,"Individuals can pate one third of their Take-Home in rent, the building has above market rate for affordable housing.",155,,
734,0.97,5351.279,5361.622,"This is an example, a very good example of how we can build affordable housing in the same building as market rate and above market rate while we are preserving historic buildings.",155,,
735,0.97,5361.622,5381.109,"And, on the first floor is commercial space and I believe there may even be, don't quote me on this, even though I am saying it on the record, I believe there is rent restricted units for the commercial space.",155,,
736,0.97,5381.109,5385.78,There are local businesses that are encouraged to be in that space.,155,,
737,0.97,5385.78,5392.987,This is a great example of how we can use our resources to keep what is unique about our city and build the resources we need.,155,,
738,0.97,5392.987,5397.825,"Along those lines, historic preservation really is an economic development tool.",156,,
739,0.97,5397.825,5407.135,"When you were talking earlier about small commercial space, that is really where a lot of our cities small commercial spaces located.",156,,
740,0.97,5407.135,5414.041,"And particularly in Pike place market, it's really an Incubator for the small businesses.",156,,
741,0.97,5414.041,5425.253,"And, in Pioneer square, the International special review district as well as Pike place market, we do review use.",156,,
742,0.97,5425.253,5431.759,We also have restrictions for the square footage of certain businesses and preferred businesses.,156,,
743,0.97,5431.759,5434.629,To keep those small spaces available.,156,,
744,0.97,5434.629,5437.865,For those tenants.,156,,
745,0.97,5437.865,5438.266,Wonderful.,157,,
746,0.97,5438.266,5441.969,This was a very good overview and presentation.,157,,
747,0.97,5441.969,5451.679,I very much appreciate it.,157,,
748,0.97,5451.679,5453.681,"Lish, would you like to join us at the table?",157,,
749,0.97,5453.681,5454.482,You don't have to.,157,,
750,0.97,5454.482,5455.349,Yes vice chair.,157,,
751,0.97,5455.349,5455.683,Please.,157,,
752,0.97,5455.683,5457.418,Thank you for the overview as well.,158,,
753,0.97,5457.418,5469.997,"The sand point building, and forgetting the name of it, but the entity that operates the Taining program for folks who are currently or formally homeless.",158,,
754,0.97,5469.997,5475.603,It was a great opportunity to see that public space being used in that way.,158,,
755,0.97,5475.603,5483.611,They also talked about the asbestos and how they had certain rooms that were kind of Quarantined officer people didn't go in there.,158,,
756,0.97,5483.611,5504.332,Does the preservation board look at recommendations for making the places that have been deemed historical landmarks were usable so we don't have buildings preserved but not being used because of things like asbestos?,158,,
757,0.97,5504.332,5507.735,"In terms of a recommendation, I think we would support that.",159,,
758,0.97,5507.735,5515.109,"In terms of what they are reviewing are weighing in on, that's not really part of their Purview.",159,,
759,0.97,5515.109,5531.525,"But if someone were to come to us with a building that has asbestos and they are going through the mitigation process, staff can review that type of work as maintenance and it's not a paid application or anything like that.",159,,
760,0.97,5531.525,5535.63,We certainly show support for adapting buildings and Reusing so they are occupied.,159,,
761,0.97,5535.63,5538.065,Because vacant buildings are not a good resource for anyone.,159,,
762,0.97,5538.199,5548.943,How does that support and get communicated either to Council or the Mayor's office or the departments that would be carrying out such a recommendation?,160,,
763,0.97,5548.943,5556.584,"One, you could ask for some feedback from the board.",161,,
764,0.97,5556.584,5557.485,Certainly.,161,,
765,0.97,5557.485,5559.353,They have written letters in the past.,161,,
766,0.97,5559.353,5562.69,And that is usually how it is communicated.,161,,
767,0.97,5562.69,5570.898,What is this specifically?,162,,
768,0.97,5570.898,5579.206,"Can you remind me of the name of the program that trains individuals who are almost formally homeless, and construction trades.",162,,
769,0.97,5579.206,5584.312,If my team was with me they might be sending me messages now.,162,,
770,0.97,5584.312,5588.182,It is a program out there.,162,,
771,0.97,5588.182,5598.926,"There is, adjacent to the training facility on the second floor, a large Gymnasium that had previously been used for recreation I guess.",162,,
772,0.97,5598.926,5606.434,"The have signs that say do not open the store, do not open this window because of asbestos.",162,,
773,0.97,5606.434,5608.836,It's a large portion right next to the training facility.,162,,
774,0.97,5608.836,5612.74,I will call and find out and make sure.,163,,
775,0.97,5612.74,5620.247,I believe it's owned by parks and Rec.,164,,
776,0.97,5620.247,5622.917,I think the board would be very supportive of renovation work happening there.,164,,
777,0.97,5622.917,5633.661,"Sure it's a matter of financing . But we do hear from community and tenants in that building, but they hoped more of those spaces would be available to the public.",164,,
778,0.97,5633.661,5635.062,I'm sure the board would support that.,164,,
779,0.97,5635.062,5639.767,"Thank you, Lish, for your comments.",165,,
780,0.97,5639.767,5643.237,It is such a great facility.,165,,
781,0.97,5643.237,5645.439,There is additional affordable housing going out there.,165,,
782,0.97,5645.439,5648.476,Beautiful modular units going in.,165,,
783,0.97,5648.476,5652.38,I think they have more than one bedroom included in some of those.,165,,
784,0.97,5652.38,5656.05,Excited for some of the work done on that.,165,,
785,0.97,5656.05,5669.797,"As more people live in that area, I went there to play soccer, we wanted to be a community center and asbestos in one of the buildings we preserve is not a great use.",165,,
786,0.97,5669.797,5673.801,Looking forward to chatting with you more about that.,165,,
787,0.97,5673.801,5688.182,"In addition to solid ground, there many buildings and tenants in the district, we are so excited to have people living in the historic district, not just playing and working.",166,,
788,0.97,5688.182,5694.422,There is a subcommittee for applications that happen for work in the historic district.,166,,
789,0.97,5694.422,5707.535,"That does include, is a committee of five volunteers and we currently have one resident within the District itself who is serving on the committee.",166,,
790,0.97,5707.535,5710.404,Wonderful.,167,,
791,0.97,5710.404,5716.944,The parks district is looking at their new six year funding cycle.,168,,
792,0.97,5716.944,5727.321,"That is a potential source of funding to help address some of these issues we have been looking at, eating more funding for the Magnus park community center.",168,,
793,0.97,5727.321,5740.101,"We do have 1000 low income residents that we have encouraged, invited to be living there yet there are environmental issues with some of these buildings and the land.",168,,
794,0.97,5740.101,5750.077,"And so to get resources in their to help, especially with the community center and providing scholarships to kids who live there is important to me.",168,,
795,0.97,5750.077,5751.278,Thank you.,168,,
796,0.97,5751.278,5751.879,Wonderful.,169,,
797,0.97,5751.879,5756.884,I would love to move on to the next part of these two agenda items.,169,,
798,0.97,5756.884,5762.289,Regarding the sunset telephone & amp; Telegraph exchange and Eagleson hall.,169,,
799,0.97,5762.289,5765.493,Thank you.,170,,
800,0.97,5765.493,5777.671,"We included here, just as a brief overview, I won't read them all, there are six standards the board considers when looking at a new landmark.",170,,
801,0.97,5777.671,5787.014,"A, B, C here and D, E, f on the next slide.",170,,
802,0.97,5787.014,5789.95,The board needs to choose at least one of those when making a designation motion.,170,,
803,0.97,5789.95,5792.92,The historic resource needs to be more than 25 years old.,170,,
804,0.97,5792.92,5795.122,In order to qualify.,170,,
805,0.97,5795.122,5804.732,"In addition to one of the standards, the board needs to determine that the property has integrity with the ability to convey that significance.",170,,
806,0.97,5804.732,5812.64,Deliberating on those applications they have those discussions in great detail.,170,,
807,0.97,5812.64,5827.822,"Just as a brief overview, the standards relate to Association of historic events or individuals, cultural history, architectural or engineering history or work of a designer.",170,,
808,0.97,5827.822,5842.369,"And also, last but not least, standard f which talks about visual landmarks and the prominence related to contrasts of age.",170,,
809,0.97,5842.369,5844.838,I think our slides are in a different order than the ordinance.,170,,
810,0.97,5844.838,5849.577,I don't know if you would like us to start with Eagleson hall.,170,,
811,0.97,5849.577,5854.081,It's totally fine to start with the sunset telephone & amp; Telegraph exchange.,171,,
812,0.97,5854.081,5857.484,We are joined by Richard Rodgers who is the owner.,172,,
813,0.97,5857.484,5869.096,The board refers to it as the sunset telephone & amp; Telegraph exchange but it is also formally known as the Masonic temple 242.,172,,
814,0.97,5869.096,5874.902,"Rich, that is his Re- development of this property, trying to recall the Masonic history.",172,,
815,0.97,5874.902,5886.814,This ordinance is to codify controls and incentives agreement reached between the city historic preservation officer and Mr. Rogers.,172,,
816,0.97,5886.814,5892.419,This is located at 1608 fourth Avenue West.,172,,
817,0.97,5892.419,5897.124,Just to give you some context there.,172,,
818,0.97,5897.124,5899.126,"This was designated by the board on June 5, 2019.",172,,
819,0.97,5899.126,5906.433,Choosing standard C. the controlled features are of the site and exterior of the building.,172,,
820,0.97,5906.433,5907.501,This was built in 1905.,172,,
821,0.97,5907.501,5914.475,Originally for the telephone and Telegraph company.,172,,
822,0.97,5914.475,5916.844,It was the first to be constructed on Queen Anne Hill.,172,,
823,0.97,5916.844,5918.445,And among the earliest exchanges in the city.,172,,
824,0.97,5918.445,5921.248,Along with those in South Seattle.,172,,
825,0.97,5921.248,5930.858,The board recognizes the significance of the change is an early workplace for women outside education and nursing fields.,172,,
826,0.97,5930.858,5938.766,The position of a telephone just was a good opportunity but also challenging with long shifts.,172,,
827,0.97,5938.766,5948.976,"In 1907 sunset employed more than 400 female operators class eight facilities including this building handling 50,000 calls annually.",172,,
828,0.97,5948.976,5961.455,"The first two decades saw an exponential increase in Seattle's population, nearly tripling from 80,000 to 240,000 residents.",172,,
829,0.97,5961.455,5965.392,In response to the increased demand for telephone and Telegraph business was completed in 1922.,172,,
830,0.97,5965.392,5976.403,"There is a new building, the Garfield exchange directly south of the public library, and both of those are also city landmarks.",172,,
831,0.97,5976.403,5989.116,"The later exchange, I am sorry, when they built the new Garfield exchange that is when this building was sold to the Masonic Fraternal order.",172,,
832,0.97,5989.116,5992.586,"They altered it to accommodate their lodge, Roman social whole.",172,,
833,0.97,5992.586,6001.295,The Masons continue to occupy the building for several decades and sold to the current owner in 2018.,172,,
834,0.97,6001.295,6004.998,Wonderful.,173,,
835,0.97,6004.998,6007.501,"Rich, would you like to share any thoughts about this building?",173,,
836,0.97,6007.501,6008.936,It is a beautiful new classical design.,173,,
837,0.97,6008.936,6012.94,And clearly it has a lot of historical meaning in her own community.,173,,
838,0.97,6012.94,6018.746,Maybe you can share a little bit about how the Masonic order has utilized the building.,173,,
839,0.97,6018.746,6023.851,I believe your organization is not the Masonic lodge specifically.,173,,
840,0.97,6023.851,6031.024,We are not affiliated with the Masons.,174,,
841,0.97,6031.024,6034.628,Maybe share a fair amount about this and let us know how you use the space.,175,,
842,0.97,6034.628,6036.43,And anything else you'd like to share.,175,,
843,0.97,6036.43,6039.333,,176,,
844,0.97,6039.333,6040.934,Could you pull the MEGAPHONE close?,177,,
845,0.97,6040.934,6053.18,"I became aware of this building in my interest in real estate and development, I'm not affiliated with the Masons anyway.",178,,
846,0.97,6053.18,6054.982,My wife and I are former Queen Anne residence.,178,,
847,0.97,6054.982,6078.405,"We are aware of the building for quite some time Masonic lodge 242 became aware there building was a Urm structure and figured out the costs associated with upgrading and retrofitting the building and were not, they wanted to sell.",178,,
848,0.97,6078.405,6082.109,That's how I became aware of it.,178,,
849,0.97,6082.109,6104.932,"Our interests, being me and my partners involved in the building, is, as all of us are Queen Anne neighbors are former Queen Anne neighbors, our interest was to try to determine whether it could be historically designated.",178,,
850,0.97,6104.932,6108.402,With our knowledge of the Garfield exchange we thought there is a good likelihood it would be.,178,,
851,0.97,6108.402,6110.237,In so doing be able to preserve the building.,178,,
852,0.97,6110.237,6116.31,And reevaluate the interior of the space for a new use to allow it to have a new life going forward.,178,,
853,0.97,6116.31,6127.421,"This might be for the table or for you, how does historic preservation process address landmark buildings with Unreinforced masonry.",179,,
854,0.97,6127.421,6130.657,I think I will let Erin that.,180,,
855,0.97,6130.657,6148.175,"When we do have a Urm building, depending on the type of seismic improvements imposed, we think of it as maintenance because the goal is to keep the building standing.",181,,
856,0.97,6148.175,6154.481,Can't preserve the building if we have a major earthquake and a loss of a lot of buildings in the city.,181,,
857,0.97,6154.481,6161.788,So we frequently look at this in administrative review.,181,,
858,0.97,6161.788,6164.191,That way it moves more quickly and is not a paid application.,181,,
859,0.97,6164.191,6166.293,And doesn't require to the architectural review committee or the board.,181,,
860,0.97,6166.293,6183.31,"But, if there are features or proposals that are sort of beyond basic level of maintenance, that might change the appearance of the building in a major way, then you would have to seek approval from the landmarks board.",181,,
861,0.97,6183.31,6194.922,"In the case of the proposed project, we looked at it collectively because he had some other alterations he was making.",181,,
862,0.97,6194.922,6211.505,"One thing I would like to add is, one of the incentives is a special tax valuation and the work to upgrade the Urm would count towards it and that's one of the and if it's being a landmark.",182,,
863,0.97,6211.505,6218.045,Any information on how you're planning to Re-And retrofit?,183,,
864,0.97,6218.045,6220.714,We Deftly are.,184,,
865,0.97,6220.714,6235.862,"The end result, the end goal is to put up a multifamily housing inside, we are trying to find that balance between being in originally industrial building, much larger scope than a single family structure.",184,,
866,0.97,6235.862,6240.167,But also it is in a 5000 Sigel families own.,184,,
867,0.97,6240.167,6245.672,"First things first, let's make the building safe.",184,,
868,0.97,6245.672,6258.485,"Historically designating it, the next step would be along with alterations we are asking for Seattle DCI would be included to Seismically retrofit the structure.",184,,
869,0.97,6258.485,6265.192,"We will retrofit the structure, and then are applying to put two Townhomes inside the structure.",184,,
870,0.97,6265.192,6266.793,And that would be the end result.,184,,
871,0.97,6266.793,6285.812,Will there be any recognition of also this is an early occupation for women to have good jobs within our community at the time when there was very Gendered roles in our society?,185,,
872,0.97,6285.812,6292.319,"From a construction and development perspective, I am not sure how we could do that.",186,,
873,0.97,6292.319,6301.528,"But I believe that very special part of the historic nature of the building, we are happy that was brought out through the designation process.",186,,
874,0.97,6301.528,6307.234,"That being recorded and included as part of the designation, we are happy with.",186,,
875,0.97,6307.234,6310.037,"In terms of building two Townhomes, I'm not sure how we could do that.",186,,
876,0.97,6310.037,6317.444,"We are going to be going, it's originally an industrial building, a large masonry structure.",186,,
877,0.97,6317.444,6322.849,Air steel retrofit system will go along with that.,186,,
878,0.97,6322.849,6330.691,That is sort of what we have been having to focus on and plan for terms of the end result of the development of Townhomes.,186,,
879,0.97,6330.691,6332.426,I couldn't agree with you more.,187,,
880,0.97,6332.426,6339.533,"It could be as simple as a plaque, one of those libraries of the folks share.",188,,
881,0.97,6339.533,6342.769,Something not so different in size and scale.,188,,
882,0.97,6342.769,6350.677,While I was in AmeriCorps I had the opportunity to live in an RCA radio antenna building from the 1920s as well.,188,,
883,0.97,6350.677,6355.382,These were long-range radio signals from across the Pacific.,188,,
884,0.97,6355.382,6370.397,"The industrial scale of that building cannot be overlooked, and while this is of a much smaller scale, I have First- hand knowledge of what it must be like inside.",188,,
885,0.97,6370.397,6380.474,"This is absolutely, again the type of project we like to see in our community, where we are having a multifamily unit that preserves the unique character of our community built by our neighbors and for our neighbors.",188,,
886,0.97,6380.474,6388.081,Just one other pitch.,189,,
887,0.97,6388.081,6390.984,One of the benefits of being landmark is you get zoning code relief.,189,,
888,0.97,6390.984,6398.592,"So when you're a landmark in a single-family zone, you can put in two units.",189,,
889,0.97,6398.592,6403.73,Thank you for mentioning that.,190,,
890,0.97,6403.73,6407.434,Thank you for your work for converting this into multi family structure.,190,,
891,0.97,6407.434,6424.05,"Having lived in Queen Anne for about six years, it is so incredible when you walk through the neighborhood to see old apartment buildings like mine that are beautiful brick buildings, there were eight units in my apartment, a beautiful old house down the house with six Entrances.",190,,
892,0.97,6424.05,6427.254,You wouldn't know it from looking on the outside.,190,,
893,0.97,6427.254,6428.054,Duplex all over the place.,190,,
894,0.97,6428.054,6463.657,"But then you realize all of those are illegal now because it has been Rezoned . When what we should be doing is thinking about creatively creating multi family dwelling units like we were talking about, I fully support the concept and appreciate the reminder there is a lot more we can do to make sure we don't have to go through the Rigmarole to navigate the complex opportunities if we were to reevaluate the zoning law.",190,,
895,0.97,6463.657,6472.799,"I couldn't agree with you more, threat district 6, there are so many Duplexes and Triplex is that are now illegal to build.",191,,
896,0.97,6472.799,6479.306,Any further questions on Telegraph and telephone exchange?,191,,
897,0.97,6479.306,6486.413,Seeing none I will move on to University of Washington Eagleson hall.,191,,
898,0.97,6486.413,6488.815,We will vote together at the end of the presentation.,191,,
899,0.97,6488.815,6491.885,Thank you.,192,,

903,0.97,6512.339,6526.653,"University of Washington, Eagleson hall . It is located just West of the main campus across the street.",193,,
904,0.97,6526.653,6529.155,You can see how it relates to the main central campus.,193,,
905,0.97,6529.155,6534.761,"This was designated by the board on June 19, 2019.",193,,
906,0.97,6534.761,6536.429,"Under standards C, D, and f.",193,,

909,0.97,6549.476,6554.08,This was completed in 1923.,193,,
910,0.97,6554.08,6562.088,"Originally, this was the young men's Christian Association, or YMCA.",193,,
911,0.97,6562.088,6566.092,They started a Chapter at the University of Washington on the campus in 1888.,193,,
912,0.97,6566.092,6572.465,And were meeting in a building that was one of the schools buildings.,193,,
913,0.97,6572.465,6582.409,A new interpretation of the Washington state Constitution Riveted religious groups from using campus facilities so they led a financial campaign to raise money and build their own building.,193,,
914,0.97,6582.409,6590.617,On this site.,193,,
915,0.97,6590.617,6593.887,"And in 1920 completed this building, I'm sorry they started in 1920 and completed in 1923.",193,,
916,0.97,6593.887,6599.426,The architectural bridge of Eagleson hall is meant to be compatible with the collegiate ethics style and the nearby campus.,193,,
917,0.97,6599.426,6618.645,"This was done in response to the University of Washington President recommendation that all local businesses and owners in 1820, that they start developing their buildings to be consistent and compatible with the character of the campus.",193,,
918,0.97,6618.645,6634.761,The YMCA occupied the building until 1963 when they decided to downsize and join the Ywca in completing a new facility in a new location.,193,,

920,0.97,6637.764,6641.368,And has resided there for over 50 years in addition to the Department of speech and human sciences.,193,,
921,0.97,6641.368,6644.671,The firm of Van Gould may sound familiar.,193,,
922,0.97,6644.671,6659.452,They designed many notable buildings in Seattle including 28 at the University and they are responsible for the master plan which influenced the design for the next 40 years.,193,,
923,0.97,6659.452,6663.289,And the administration building.,194,,

925,0.97,6669.896,6673.299,I believe the school of social work has moved down the street to a new building.,195,,
926,0.97,6673.299,6678.004,They are located in both the buildings.,196,,
927,0.97,6678.004,6684.077,"Several of the hearing sciences, there are a couple of classrooms and offices in Eagle's and.",196,,

930,0.97,6701.628,6705.031,He had a lot to share with me about the importance of this building.,197,,
931,0.97,6705.031,6706.032,That's great.,198,,
932,0.97,6706.032,6710.503,You have anything you would like to share?,199,,
933,0.97,6710.503,6729.756,"We are excited about this, it is a building that is a Urm building, we are in fact on the way and design of how we can structurally support this building.",200,,
934,0.97,6729.756,6748.274,It is great working with Erin and Sarah in a collaborative process and how we can come up with some structural solutions to minimize the effect on this historic structure.,200,,

936,0.97,6748.675,6752.545,Are there incentives to the controls we are applying?,201,,

938,0.97,6758.084,6763.289,Are there incentives?,201,,
939,0.97,6763.289,6767.16,The incentives that could most likely apply here would be building code relief.,202,,
940,0.97,6767.16,6772.198,I don't think you need to seek zoning code relief because of the campus master plan.,202,,
941,0.97,6772.198,6776.302,"That is probably, like energy code as well.",202,,
942,0.97,6776.302,6784.811,"Preserving historic windows, likely one of the things we are going to ask Sdci to approve.",202,,
943,0.97,6784.811,6792.051,I don't suppose you will be pursuing a special tax evaluation.,202,,
944,0.97,6792.051,6793.319,Not as a state institution.,203,,
945,0.97,6793.319,6797.19,We expect that rich will likely do that.,204,,
