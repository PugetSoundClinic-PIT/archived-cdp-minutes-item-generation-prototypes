123,0.97,769.268,774.607,I want to welcome everyone from the office of immigrant and refugee affairs who are with us today.,37,,
124,0.97,774.607,792.358,I am really glad to have you all here to share with us and the viewing public a little bit about the work the office of immigrant and refugee affairs has been leading on and the additional work you undertook in 2020 around rapid response to emerging community needs.,37,,
125,0.97,792.358,806.238,"I think it's fair to say that when I first championed this funding in the city's 2019 budget process, the 2020 we were all understanding was very Differet from what 2020 ended up actually being.",37,,
126,0.97,806.238,831.797,So for that I want to thank each of you and your team for all of the hard work that you have done and for all the times that your team has run towards the crisis to help manage the Covid-19 impacts on our community and to help insure the immigrant refugee communities were not left out of being informed and staying safe.,37,,
127,0.97,831.797,845.644,With that I'm going to hand it over to director vu to introduce herself and to introduce the team with us today who is going to be here to make this presentation.,37,,

130,0.97,847.313,880.613,I'm thrilled to be able to share with you the work that we accomplished in 2020 and thanks immeasurably to your leadership and the leadership of other Council members we've been able to--you've provided us an opportunity to step up and provide critical services and supports for communities during a time that was incredibly turbulent and when we were witness to many levels of inequities.,38,,
131,0.97,880.613,910.175,"I just want to start first with also congratulating our team members and so I'm just in the position to be able to talk about it, but this is what you will see in this presentation is a big credit to the incredible talent and commitment that we have among our staff and as you know, we're small, but we're a mighty crew and we do a lot with just a little bit.",38,,
132,0.97,910.175,914.88,So with that I will get started with the presentation.,38,,
133,0.97,924.39,924.957,.,39,,
134,0.97,924.957,928.16,We're going to pull it up.,40,,
135,0.97,928.16,928.727,Here we go.,40,,
136,0.97,928.727,928.961,Thanks.,40,,
137,0.97,928.961,936.201,"We are the Seattle office of immigrant refugee affairs and I'm Cuc vu, the director of Oira.",41,,
138,0.97,936.201,938.704,Move on to the next slide.,41,,
139,0.97,949.014,977.543,We are going to talk about the Covid-19 work that we did last year and first we want to kick that off with an overview about one of the most important things that we were able to deliver last year which is the Seattle disaster relief fund to our most vulnerable and low Incoe immigrant and refugee residents.,41,,
140,0.97,977.543,980.245,So here we have one of our staff to kick us off.,41,,
141,0.97,981.647,982.414,Oksana?,41,,
142,0.97,986.618,994.927,"Would we be able to go back to slide number 1 I think was starting it off in the middle, the presentation.",42,,
143,0.97,994.927,995.728,I see it.,43,,
144,0.97,995.728,995.995,Yeah.,44,,
145,0.97,995.995,999.565,If we can go to slide number one.,44,,
146,0.97,1011.877,1015.481,That slide says Covid-19 responses and positive community outcomes.,44,,
147,0.97,1018.283,1021.587,There we go.,45,,
148,0.97,1110.976,1135.0,"We begin with our commitment equity as always centering community and much of what you'll hear throughout this slide begins with community and engages community and the solutions that we develop are community centered and therefore, from that we're able to achieve also Equity- centered solutions.",46,,
149,0.97,1135.0,1137.269,We are small.,46,,
150,0.97,1137.269,1150.716,"We're only 9 1/2 staff and because of that small size we actually have a very Matrixed structure and so community outreach and engagement, for example, doesn't sit with one person or two people.",46,,
151,0.97,1150.716,1155.821,It is something that is shared with the entire team.,46,,
152,0.97,1155.821,1158.39,Contracts also doesn't sit with one person.,46,,
153,0.97,1158.39,1183.215,"It is straight across and our program managers have a matrix body of work that not only includes community outreach and engagement, but contracts management and policy and that matrix approach allows us to be collaborative and nimble and responsive and most importantly as we saw last year and that you'll see particularly from our work on the Seattle disaster relief fund innovative.",46,,
154,0.97,1183.215,1184.85,"Next slide, please.",46,,
155,0.97,1191.223,1208.373,"And we really want to thank you, Council President Gonzalez, and other Council members, Mosqueda, Morales, et cetera for providing some of the budget supports there that allowed us to do the work that we will share today.",46,,
156,0.97,1208.373,1253.018,"In the rapid response Fund, for example, it was to engage and rapidly respond to emergent threats facing Seattle immigrants and that was $375,000 that Council member Gonzalez, you initiated and then former Council member Pacheco included another $50,000 which was used for Daca fee assistance and we saw a $25,000 match from Facebook and then with the joint Covid-19 relief package approximately $9 million from that body of funding and 8.3 million which went to direct cash assistance and 700,000 to support ongoing language access work.",46,,
157,0.97,1255.02,1260.926,And so with that I'd like to turn it over first to Oksana.,46,,
158,0.97,1265.631,1267.099,We're moving to the next slide.,46,,
159,0.97,1269.835,1271.336,Hi.,47,,
160,0.97,1271.336,1290.789,"My name is Oksana Bilobran and I am a legal defense and program specialist at the office of immigrant and refugee affairs and I'm here to talk to you about two of the programs that I worked on together with the rest of our team in 2020 and one of them, we call it rapid response.",47,,
161,0.97,1290.789,1312.444,"As Cuc mentioned earlier, the program was designed in anticipation of various court decisions and rule changes that would have a huge impact on immigrant and refugee communities in 2020 and the city of Seattle has appropriated $375,000 in one time rapid response fund in order to help community navigate these issues.",47,,
162,0.97,1312.444,1326.692,"As hard as 2020 was for everybody in Seattle, it was extremely hard for our immigrant and refugee neighbors because in addition to the pandemic and economic crisis, they had to deal with the onslaught of immigration policies that were targeting them.",47,,
163,0.97,1326.692,1346.111,"It was the year at the beginning of the year we, of course, didn't know there was going to be the final year of the Trump administration, but we knew it was going to be the year in which many of these programs will be introduced and rolled out and it would be potentially very harmful to our immigrant and refugee communities.",47,,
164,0.97,1346.111,1346.411,Next slide.,47,,
165,0.97,1346.411,1346.611,Yes.,47,,
166,0.97,1346.611,1362.561,"So three major issues that were identified in consultation with our community partners and Community-Based organizations that we knew we had to pay attention to were public charge, Daca and immigrant fee increases.",47,,
167,0.97,1362.561,1374.039,"So public charge in brief just to kind of set the information that's out there is the set of rules in which prospective immigrants can be denied entry, Residency in the United States.",47,,
168,0.97,1374.039,1395.127,"If they are likely to become primarily dependent on the government for support and these rules were expanded in February 2020, so they have been in effect for about a year and once they changed and went in effect they created huge confusion and fear, especially due to the added layer of the pandemic.",47,,
169,0.97,1395.127,1407.906,So new immigrants and those who were living for a while here didn't know they were able to access and benefit from various programs designed to support and provide social safety net.,47,,
170,0.97,1407.906,1414.846,"Next issue with Daca, stands for Obama era immigration program that was designed to protect Dreamers from deportation.",47,,
171,0.97,1414.846,1419.251,It was on track to be potentially terminated in 2020.,47,,
172,0.97,1419.251,1431.029,"The Supreme Court decision that was expected on the case, it was anticipated that it was going to terminate the program and there would be millions of people across the country left in limbo if that were to come true.",47,,
173,0.97,1431.029,1436.468,And the last issue we were ready to work on was immigration fee increases.,47,,
174,0.97,1436.468,1447.379,There was an initiative coming from the Trump administration that would significantly increase immigration benefit fees and eliminate fee waivers for those who were eligible.,47,,
175,0.97,1447.379,1448.814,"Next slide, please.",47,,
176,0.97,1450.482,1464.396,"So in the first issue of public charge, we decided to have a multiple layer approach and first of them was sort of train the Trainer approach.",47,,
177,0.97,1464.396,1487.085,"We knew that people worked with Community-Based organization would be calling case managers asking if they are still safe to apply for and receive S.N.A.P., so food benefits and medical care and we knew that we had to equip those case managers on the ground with the correct information on the program because it was just so complex and had multiple layers to it.",47,,
178,0.97,1487.085,1490.755,So we first organized a training for service providers.,47,,
179,0.97,1490.755,1496.661,It took place in late February when we were still getting together in person.,47,,
180,0.97,1496.661,1517.616,"It was that day when the public charge actually went into effect and we had over 90 participants there and the presentation was conducted by our experts at the Northwest immigrants rights project and that presentation was also viewed live and on Facebook and had over 9,000 views.",47,,
181,0.97,1517.616,1545.51,We also knew that we needed to provide a reference guide and frequently asked questions and we developed a pretty sophisticated reference guide that listed every available social safety net program in Washington State and analyzed whether or not receipt of that benefit would impact prospective and current immigrants living in the United States and how that would impact depending on your immigration status.,47,,
182,0.97,1545.51,1561.026,So that reference guide was widely shared and we've heard that it was extremely useful in the community for people answering questions from the public about whether or not they should continue receiving benefits.,47,,
183,0.97,1561.026,1561.66,"Next slide, please.",47,,
184,0.97,1561.66,1566.565,We also decided to work directly with communities and partner with our Community- based organization.,47,,
185,0.97,1566.565,1599.164,"At the beginning of the year we asked who wanted to host public charge workshops and had a pretty elaborate schedule of these In-Person events and right as we started doing them in person at the end of February, we had to switch to a virtual models on our County, the state and the country went into our first Lockdown, but Nevertheless we were successful in organizing ten of these workshops both In-Person and virtual and they reached over 1,300 community members.",47,,
186,0.97,1599.164,1609.641,"We also provided three sources for our partners to do this presentation, not just for general public, but for Community-Based organization, legal practitioners.",47,,
187,0.97,1609.641,1619.417,"They even did several presentations for Washington Attorney General team because as I mentioned, this policy is still extremely complicated.",47,,
188,0.97,1619.417,1629.327,"Not only public was confused, but even legal experts in the field who don't work in immigration law day to day had to be presented with that information and we were ready to support those efforts.",47,,
189,0.97,1629.327,1631.262,"Next slide, please.",47,,
190,0.97,1633.498,1648.913,"On the second issue of Daca, as I mentioned, in 2017 Trump administration rescinded the program, deferred action for childhood arrivals and then that case was making its way to the Supreme Court.",47,,
191,0.97,1648.913,1659.591,There were wide speculation the Supreme Court would potentially terminate the program and there would be an anxiety and fear in the community.,47,,
192,0.97,1659.591,1686.084,"So in preparation for that Supreme Court decision we decided to do One-On-One legal consultations and partnered with three of our legal service providers, Northwest immigrants right project, Catholic immigration legal services and de PUEBLO and together these services provided almost 100 consultations to Seattle residents, workers and students.",47,,
193,0.97,1686.084,1697.062,"Once we knew that the Supreme Court was not going to terminate Daca, they also assisted people with both renewals, Daca renewals, and also first time applications for the program.",47,,
194,0.97,1698.129,1700.432,"Next slide, please.",47,,
195,0.97,1711.176,1716.748,"In addition to this, we Amy the legal demand for these services was going to be higher than these three organizations could manage.",47,,
196,0.97,1716.748,1726.491,"We also knew due to Federal administration policies, all of our legal assistant resources were pretty much depleted.",47,,
197,0.97,1726.491,1734.165,"It was really hard for us to recruit pro Bono attorneys to provide these consultations and therefore, we came up with a pretty innovative model.",47,,
198,0.97,1734.165,1767.599,"The models in which we partnered with our colleagues at the King County bar Association and also American immigration lawyer Association and so three of us, three partners, got together and we decided that the best way to proceed would be to use a Stipend model in which legal service providers, immigration attorneys would be able to choose and either accept a modest Stipend or ask for a continuing legal education Cle credits or simply donate the time to provide these consultations.",47,,
199,0.97,1767.599,1794.592,"So as a result, we successfully organized and offered five virtual Daca clinics between July and November 2020 and through those five legal clinics we were able to assist over 200 clients with signup for them and our wonderful American immigration lawyers Association attorneys provided 77 three-hour shifts for the community.",47,,
200,0.97,1795.36,1797.662,"Next slide, please.",47,,
201,0.97,1802.567,1815.48,This slide makes me most happy probably because it shows some of the results of what our services meant to those who seek and receive them.,47,,
202,0.97,1815.48,1829.16,So this slide provides sort of background on what the people who requested consultation with immigration attorneys are eligible to apply for in the future.,47,,
203,0.97,1829.16,1838.636,Studies have shown consistently that between 25 and 30% of Undocumented immigrants who live in United States have a path to some sort of legal status but don't know about it.,47,,
204,0.97,1838.636,1841.639,And after meeting with immigration attorneys these are the results.,47,,
205,0.97,1841.639,1849.747,It looked like roughly 30% of folks who received consultation and screening were eligible for initial Daca.,47,,
206,0.97,1849.747,1869.601,"About 30% were eligible for renewing the Daca status, but almost 40% of people were eligible for a Family-Based petition, which is huge because it ultimately results in a green card unlike Daca which is a temporary program.",47,,
207,0.97,1869.601,1877.208,Also 23% were eligible for a new Visa and only about 20% of people who requested consultation had no relief available at that time.,47,,
208,0.97,1877.208,1889.42,So that is incredible news and we hope that people who heard they might be eligible for further relief will be able to seek assistance in the future and actually get their status and documents in the United States.,47,,
209,0.97,1890.321,1892.624,"Next slide, please.",47,,
210,0.97,1894.726,1900.732,And the last issue that I identified earlier as the immigration fee increases.,47,,
211,0.97,1900.732,1910.675,So in November 2019 the United States citizenship and immigration services submitted a new proposal that would drastically increase application fees and eliminate fee waivers.,47,,
212,0.97,1910.675,1921.486,"Under the new proposal fee for citizenship would increase more than 80% from $640 to 1,170.",47,,
213,0.97,1921.486,1971.736,"The cost of Daca renewal would increase from 495 to 765, an increase of 55% and also for the first time ever in United States there was a proposed fee to request Asylum which was sort of unheard of and when we talked about what to do and how to address that issue in addition to all of our advocacy and submitting rules, comments opposing that rule, we decided to provide tangible relief for immigrants who needed assistance paying these immigration fees and we decided to allocate $150,000 from the funding that we received to provide direct immigration fees scholarships to eligible Seattle residents, workers and students.",47,,
214,0.97,1971.736,1987.418,"And so to date 134,000 of that money has been allocated and as you can see, most of that money's been given for Daca fee scholarships which almost 190 people were able to receive.",47,,
215,0.97,1987.418,1992.924,Also we awarded 36 Naturalization fee scholarships and seven green Card-Related scholarships.,47,,
216,0.97,1992.924,2017.048,It was extremely important to the community and we heard it very clearly that it was very tangible help because in the middle of the year with the economic downturn it meant that people could actually use this money directly to pay immigration documents and those immigration documents were often green card that allows you to work.,47,,
217,0.97,2017.048,2030.595,"So had they not been able to receive the scholarship, they potentially would be able to even lose ability to work in United States if their green card or work authorization were to expire or their Daca status.",47,,
218,0.97,2030.595,2044.275,We also knew that many of these beneficiaries of these scholarships were excluded from the stimulus checks that were sent out earlier in 2020 because they did not have social security numbers.,47,,
219,0.97,2044.275,2062.16,"Is, for example, first time Daca applicants, they don't have social security number and therefore, what they needed to apply for their status, this was very beneficial because, as I said earlier, they were not able--they were excluded from the Federal assistance earlier in the year.",47,,
220,0.97,2062.16,2073.304,So we partnered with El Centro de la Rosa who administered this scholarship fund and also legal providers who screened and referred their clients to receive these funds.,47,,
221,0.97,2073.304,2075.139,"Next slide, please.",47,,
222,0.97,2077.842,2085.917,I just wanted to highlight a couple key things that made this program extremely succesful and positive the way it was.,47,,
223,0.97,2085.917,2110.308,"First of all, we are very thankful for city leadership and particularly Council President Gonzalez for the leadership and providing this one-time funding and allowing us, giving us the space to respond quickly to the needs as they were emerging and be flexible enough to go the way the community needed us to go.",47,,
224,0.97,2110.308,2129.694,"We also worked Collaboratively with our partners and came up with innovative models, as I said, that legal clinic with our Association is something that is now being used as an example across the country.",47,,
225,0.97,2129.694,2133.865,There are various publications talking about that model and trying to adopt it across the country.,47,,
226,0.97,2133.865,2158.055,Well also had to pivot from working in person to providing services virtually and that required create activity from our partners and we had to be very creative in delivering information about all of these emerging changes in immigration policy and make sure that our communities were able to stay informed and on track with everything that was going on.,47,,
227,0.97,2158.055,2179.944,"That was a lot of ups and downs surrounding policies as they were developing in 2020 and actually today one of those issues, public charge that I was talking about earlier, looks like it might be the beginning of the end of that policy with Supreme Court dismissing the case.",47,,
228,0.97,2179.944,2181.112,That was before them.,47,,
229,0.97,2181.112,2191.889,So we will have to continue our communication and making sure our communities stay informed that this issue's beyond 2020 even though the funding is no longer there.,47,,
230,0.97,2191.889,2201.032,Our office will work tirelessly to make sure we continue both advocacy and information that our communities rely on.,47,,
231,0.97,2203.668,2204.135,"Next slide, please.",47,,
232,0.97,2204.135,2217.648,And with that I am ready to move to talk about one more program that our office was able to stand up very quickly and that program was Seattle disaster relief fund for immigrants.,47,,
233,0.97,2217.648,2219.65,"Next slide, please.",47,,
234,0.97,2222.386,2238.135,"As Cuc mentioned earlier, this fund was created to support vulnerable immigrant and refugee communities who have been financially impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic but were shut out of the Federal assistance or the C.A.R.E.S.",47,,
235,0.97,2238.135,2239.403,Act and the statement unemployment insurance.,47,,
236,0.97,2239.403,2248.946,"As you know, the stimulus checks were denied to both Undocumented workers and residents and also the U.S.",47,,
237,0.97,2248.946,2252.85,Born children of families that were--mixed status families.,47,,
238,0.97,2252.85,2264.662,"So investing in the Seattle families who needed help during this pandemic, we knew that that would insure that Seattle communities and their local economy is able to recover faster and more fully.",47,,
239,0.97,2264.662,2277.742,So we were Tasked to design and implement in a very short Timeline a program that would provide such assistance to Seattle's most vulnerable low income immigrants and refugee residents.,47,,
240,0.97,2277.742,2285.116,"The criteria we used, the eligibility criteria that was decided on, was that people had to be 18 years old or older.",47,,
241,0.97,2285.116,2296.36,They had to live in Seattle or attend school in Seattle or work within the city boundaries and also that they were ineligible to receive Federal C.A.R.E.S.,47,,
242,0.97,2296.36,2300.431,Act economic impact payment also known as stimulus check due to their immigration status.,47,,
243,0.97,2300.431,2308.205,There was an income eligibility requirement which was they were supposed to be under 50% of median household income in Seattle for the past nine months.,47,,
244,0.97,2308.673,2310.975,"Next slide, please.",47,,
245,0.97,2312.743,2316.013,"As I mentioned, we had to work really fast.",47,,
246,0.97,2316.013,2348.012,"We designed the program in about six weeks from the time we find out that we were going to be doing that till the time we opened the only indication and that design process included consultation partners to priorities, amount, the best outreach strategies to selecting the organization that was going to Disburse all the money and administer the program and that was scholarship John Keys.",47,,
247,0.97,2348.012,2356.22,To selecting one on one partners to do outreach and also in language assistance for those who need to apply for this application.,47,,
248,0.97,2356.22,2375.106,Our application and all of the materials were translated into seven languages which allowed us to reach into harder to reach communities in Seattle and make sure that language was not a barrier in Accessing these important financial assistance Fund.,47,,
249,0.97,2375.106,2397.628,"We also developed safeguards to prevent misuse and fraud and also we heard that trust was an important concern for the community who were afraid to potentially reach out due to concerns, so mentioned earlier, public charge and also due to concerns about the information being potentially disclosed or misused if they were to apply and receive such assistance.",47,,
250,0.97,2400.064,2420.684,"So we are happy to report that most of the applicants who were approved for funding were able to receive their assistance within about two months from applying, which is really critical when you're looking and are waiting for money that might mean that you're not getting evicted and you're getting the food that your family needs.",47,,
251,0.97,2420.684,2423.587,So that two months is something we are really proud of.,47,,
252,0.97,2423.587,2424.288,"Next slide, please.",47,,
253,0.97,2425.456,2427.158,Hold on just a second there.,48,,
254,0.97,2427.158,2430.194,We do have a hand raised.,48,,
255,0.97,2430.194,2434.064,Council member Mosqueda has a question on that last slide or maybe on the previous slide.,48,,
256,0.97,2434.064,2444.308,"Also just for the record and the benefit of the viewing public and those of us here, I did want to make a note for the record Council member Sawant has joined the committee hearing.",48,,
257,0.97,2444.308,2451.282,She actually got here at the beginning of this presentation and I didn't get a chance to formally recognize her entry into the meeting.,48,,
258,0.97,2451.282,2455.686,"So with that being said, council member Mosqueda, the floor is yours.",48,,
259,0.97,2455.686,2456.987,"Thank you, Madam President.",49,,
260,0.97,2456.987,2462.893,"Thank you very much for this overview, really excited to see these details.",49,,
261,0.97,2462.893,2467.298,Just a quick question on the sort of logistics and I didn't mean to interrupt the flow here.,49,,
262,0.97,2467.298,2477.441,"So if you want to come back, happy to do so, but I just had a thought that came in as you were talking about rolling the program out and how we got these dollars to communities.",49,,
263,0.97,2477.441,2480.711,So gift cards are what you used here.,49,,
264,0.97,2480.711,2482.012,Is that what you said?,49,,
265,0.97,2482.012,2493.057,"Not only gift cards, we had several options and that was also what we discussed with the community.",50,,
266,0.97,2493.057,2495.759,There were options including checks and direct deposit and gift cards.,50,,
267,0.97,2496.827,2504.702,So the option that was selected and applicants for the fund had an option to select how they wanted to receive the payment.,50,,
268,0.97,2504.702,2513.744,"It was the same amount, but the form of the payment was something that they could choose and most of them opted to receive a check.",50,,
269,0.97,2513.744,2526.557,"Checks were pretty easy because they could be tracked and we could see whether they were cashed or not and also they could be canceled if lost and Reissued, but yes, there were some folks who requested gift cards instead.",50,,
270,0.97,2526.557,2528.325,That's great.,51,,
271,0.97,2528.325,2537.167,I think that's really important because that helps meet folks where they're at and their comfort level and maybe what their comfort level is with various institutions as well.,51,,
272,0.97,2537.167,2546.277,Thank you for that background and I assume as well that that helped to address any sort of fees that were associated like with activation cards or with deposit or things like that.,51,,
273,0.97,2546.277,2549.68,Was that part of the conversation you all had as well?,51,,
274,0.97,2549.68,2552.149,Increase.,52,,
275,0.97,2552.149,2562.459,We had several conversations about access to payment and also what it would look like for folks that were Unhoused or Unbanked.,52,,
276,0.97,2562.459,2567.965,We also had partnership with Seattle credit Union that assisted us with Cashing checks for folks who did not have bank accounts.,52,,
277,0.97,2567.965,2579.043,So there was extensive work that went into planning and addressing all of the barriers that would prevent a population from getting money quickly and effectively.,52,,
278,0.97,2579.043,2579.476,Very exciting.,53,,
279,0.97,2579.476,2597.261,"And then just a last question associated with that, as you're having these conversations with folks, is there also a discussion at this point, this is like a point of service to talk about the utility discount program or food assistance or housing assistance?",53,,
280,0.97,2597.261,2606.17,"Was there any sort of opportunity for Cross- enrollment, if you will, if folks weren't concerned with the public charge issue and did want to go that route?",53,,
281,0.97,2606.17,2606.403,Yes.,54,,
282,0.97,2606.403,2606.704,Definitely.,54,,
283,0.97,2606.704,2623.52,"So one of the things that was happening--we partnered with 21 organizations and those organizations, some of those were also partnered with the fund like this on a state level because those two funds, the city of Seattle and also the state one, went in parallel and there were also some assistance coming from King County.",54,,
284,0.97,2623.52,2642.406,"So we've heard that when people called them for one--with questions about one Fund, they were able to refer them and Cross-Refer them to various resources and help them apply for both funds and some of our partners, as I said, were doing food assistance and the rental assistance.",54,,
285,0.97,2643.807,2666.964,"We actually at the beginning of the very planning stages of this program we considered whether we wanted to provide this assistance in the form for a specific need like for rental assistance or food, but what we heard from the community very loudly was that best way to truly provide meaningful assistance was to not tie it to any specific need because they could be so diverse.",54,,
286,0.97,2666.964,2668.999,It could be child care.,54,,
287,0.97,2668.999,2669.7,It could be Healthcare.,54,,
288,0.97,2669.7,2678.042,And so for our specific fund we left it very broad and we trusted the community to decide what they wanted to spend that money on.,54,,
289,0.97,2680.844,2681.345,Excellent.,55,,
290,0.97,2681.345,2681.779,That's wonderful.,55,,
291,0.97,2681.779,2685.282,Thank you very much for that background.,55,,
292,0.97,2685.282,2685.549,Sure.,56,,
293,0.97,2685.549,2693.123,"I won't interrupt you, but I just wanted to say thank you as well for the Disaggregated data.",57,,
294,0.97,2693.123,2705.402,"I know we are always pushing for more Dissegregated data, so it's very Helpfulyou are lifting up that information and making sure we are highlighting the various populations that we're able to serve.",57,,
295,0.97,2705.402,2706.136,Thank you very much.,57,,
296,0.97,2706.136,2708.472,"Council President, that is my line of questioning.",57,,
297,0.97,2708.472,2714.711,"That you so much, council member, Mosqueda.",58,,
298,0.97,2714.711,2715.279,"Take it away, Oksana.",58,,
299,0.97,2715.279,2715.546,Yes.,59,,
300,0.97,2715.546,2720.417,"Can we go to the next slide, please.",59,,
301,0.97,2720.417,2730.994,"Some numbers, we received over 18,000 applications and roughly 20% of them ended up receiving cash assistance.",59,,
302,0.97,2730.994,2742.406,"So at the end 3,705 people or households were able to benefit from this and as I mentioned, the payment came in the form of check or direct deposit or gift cards.",59,,
303,0.97,2743.207,2760.824,Also early on we got a direction that we wanted to Prioritize this fund for the city residents and roughly 90% of all the money went to Seattle residents and about 10% went to people who work or went to school in Seattle.,59,,
304,0.97,2764.228,2769.533,I'm happy to say we were able to fund every eligible applicant who lives in Seattle.,59,,
305,0.97,2769.533,2770.3,So that was good.,59,,
306,0.97,2770.3,2778.575,"We reached not everybody, not every worker and student, but every eligible resident of Seattle did receive funding.",59,,
307,0.97,2778.575,2797.694,"As you can see from the slide, about 60% of those who benefited were households and about 40% were individuals and from those households that applied we calculated that roughly 3,754 were children that were able to access this money.",59,,
308,0.97,2798.829,2801.131,"Next slide, please.",59,,
309,0.97,2806.937,2829.226,"So first when we met with the community and we said how do we do this, one of our first questions was do we want to go and provide assistance on the first come, first served basis or do we want to have an application period that's open for a certain number of weeks and then look at all of them together and Prioritize because we knew that the need is going to be greater than the money we had?",59,,
310,0.97,2829.226,2845.242,"So what we heard in those consultations with communities that we needed to develop a Prioritization system and set up criteria to see who is most vulnerable, for whom this assistance would be most meaningful.",59,,
311,0.97,2845.242,2854.618,"And our community gave us suggestions to Prioritize, unaccompanied minors, Unhoused individuals, single parents and survivors of violence.",59,,
312,0.97,2854.618,2869.266,"People who are at high risk of severe Covid illness or those who already had Covid in the Pat, people who lost income and Renters.",59,,
313,0.97,2869.266,2875.672,You can tell that most of our applicants and beneficiaries were in those categories.,59,,
314,0.97,2875.672,2878.242,Over 90% of them lost income and were Renters.,59,,
315,0.97,2878.242,2894.725,"We also were able to partner with organizations that serve unaccompanied minors because there was a concern we didn't want to give out funds directly to children under 18, but we worked with an organization such as K.I.N.D.",59,,
316,0.97,2894.725,2902.633,Who work directly with youth and were able to purchase items for them instead of giving cash assistance to children.,59,,
317,0.97,2903.533,2905.769,"Next slide, please.",59,,
318,0.97,2910.674,2924.688,This is a breakdown of racial and ethnic data of those who applied and received our funds and it shows the breadth of reach of partners that we work with.,59,,
319,0.97,2924.688,3002.632,"So over 80% of beneficiaries of our fund were from Latinx community and that's consistent with the data that we have about this vulnerable group of people who are shut out from the Federal stimulus money, but 10% were of Asian descent or Asian-Americans and you can tell like there's a long list of languages that--preferred languages that people indicated and that's again, we wanted to highlight that our network of partners was able to reach folks that don't normally interact with government, don't normally--aren't easy to reach because they speak languages that are very, very unique and we were so proud of that network of our partners for being able to reach those in the communities and over half of all of applications that were submitted to us came in language other than English and a good percentage of them were submitted by our partners who provided One-On-One assistance with applications in languages other than the seven that we had the application be translated in.",59,,
320,0.97,3002.632,3004.735,"And the next slide, please.",59,,
321,0.97,3008.672,3034.765,So this is the story that I think sort of summarizes and highlights why programs like this are important and what we heard from our communities during our Debrief meeting what struck them the most was talking one on one with community members and hearing their stories and sometimes it was--the story of hope in the midst of despair just like this story that was shared here with you.,59,,
322,0.97,3034.765,3040.47,The stories of the people who called made us realize how much the community needs these funds.,59,,
323,0.97,3040.47,3049.546,A caller told us about how his wife had gotten Covid-19 and she ended up getting a stroke and became paralyzed from the neck down.,59,,
324,0.97,3049.546,3054.618,This let him to stay home and take care of his wife and it caused him to lose his job.,59,,
325,0.97,3054.618,3067.097,It was very touching and you could hear anguish in his voice and he really needed the funds and we wish we could have done more.,59,,
326,0.97,3067.097,3071.334,"There were many, many stories like that, but that's the one that kind of highlights.",59,,
327,0.97,3071.334,3082.913,On behalf of that family and those recipients we want to say huge thank you to the city for providing this help and support in times like this.,59,,
328,0.97,3082.913,3086.316,"The next story--next slide, please.",59,,
329,0.97,3089.019,3093.623,"There is much to be said about the program, what made it successful.",59,,
330,0.97,3093.623,3107.504,We have a report coming out that we potentially will be sharing widely and the two main things that we want to highlight is Collaborations.,59,,
331,0.97,3107.504,3116.68,Collaborations both between the city departments that were extremely helpful in expediting all of the processes that sometimes take a much longer time and we didn't have that time.,59,,
332,0.97,3116.68,3138.401,"So we're thankful for the internal support within the city, but also for all of our outreach partners that were able to Prioritize this work and put pause on the other existing projects and reach out to community and work over hours and weekends to make sure to answer questions and assist those who wanted to apply.",59,,
333,0.97,3138.401,3155.785,Also a crucial piece that made this program successful was language access because it reduced barriers that often immigrants can't overcome without language access.,59,,
334,0.97,3155.785,3170.2,"So as I mentioned earlier, we just want to say how proud we are for city of Seattle for living up to its values and using public funds to provide cash assistance.",59,,
335,0.97,3172.335,3182.946,"This I think I'm done with my part of the presentation and if there are any questions about these two programs, I'd be happy to answer them, but my colleague still has a portion of the presentation, too.",59,,
336,0.97,3182.946,3183.213,Yeah.,60,,
337,0.97,3183.213,3189.419,We have a few slides left in this presentation before we shift gears here.,60,,
338,0.97,3189.419,3191.755,"Any questions or comments, colleagues?",60,,
339,0.97,3197.36,3198.662,Not seeing any hands raised.,60,,
340,0.97,3198.662,3210.006,"Oksana, I want to thank you for this really in depth presentation.",60,,
341,0.97,3210.006,3233.129,"It's just a tremendous, tremendous amount of work and just want to sort of again thank Council member Mosqueda who is on this Committee for all the hard work she did in making sure to include specific line item to be able to provide this kind of assistance in the context of the jump start Seattle and for disaster relief particular.",60,,
342,0.97,3233.129,3258.521,"The impact has been really, really significant and important and I'm just so grateful for that leadership and I am grateful for having had the opportunity to support that work and this is the product of a lot of hard work by city Council to meet community where they're at and support their needs in this moment of crisis.",60,,
343,0.97,3258.521,3264.894,"In a lot of ways we didn't anticipate, but I'm glad that it worked out the way it did.",60,,
344,0.97,3264.894,3265.228,So thanks.,60,,
345,0.97,3265.228,3268.031,Thanks for all your work in that space.,60,,
346,0.97,3270.433,3270.734,All right.,60,,
347,0.97,3270.734,3274.504,"Peggy, are you going to walk us through the language access program?",60,,
348,0.97,3274.504,3279.809,I am so excited to talk about language access as you all know.,60,,
349,0.97,3279.809,3289.953,"I am always screaming to the heavens how important culturally appropriate language access is, not just interpretation, but actually give people meaningful access in language.",60,,
350,0.97,3289.953,3300.363,"I'm so happy to be hosting this portion of the presentation as well, so critically, critically important to our community.",60,,
351,0.97,3300.363,3301.398,So take it away.,60,,
352,0.97,3301.398,3303.466,Thank you.,61,,
353,0.97,3303.466,3304.701,My name is Peggy.,61,,
354,0.97,3304.701,3318.081,I'm the language access--that's my cat in the background--language access program and policy specialist with Oira.,61,,
355,0.97,3318.081,3318.815,"Next slide, please.",61,,
356,0.97,3318.815,3330.56,So before I share our positive outcomes and our response I really want to share this quote and then also our office's approach to language access.,61,,
357,0.97,3330.56,3370.967,"So this quote really sums it up, that though we know that Covid brings us tremendous challenges and a crisis that we have to respond quickly to, it also presents us a great opportunity to really be more responsive to immigrant and refugee communities and also ramp up our capacity to really rethink what language access means for the city of Seattle and how to really be the welcoming city that we with we want to be.",61,,
358,0.97,3370.967,3373.103,"Next slide, please.",61,,
359,0.97,3373.103,3383.847,In this presentation I will highlight four language access opportunities that we observe in our language access and Covid response.,61,,
360,0.97,3383.847,3410.306,So the first one is because of our partnership and we quickly had our approach at the very beginning of the pandemic we were able to work directly with public health in King County and also Department of health with the state to really think about what we should collaborate with for language access and then share resources.,61,,
361,0.97,3410.306,3434.731,So at the very beginning in about March and April last year we work directly with public health to host seven In- language Webinars sharing resources and information with our immigrant refugee community members and then till this day we still work with public health.,61,,
362,0.97,3434.731,3448.912,"In fact, we just hosted two Covid vaccine information sessions, one in English and one in Spanish, with public health and we have seven more In-Language information sessions coming up in this month and the next month.",61,,
363,0.97,3451.381,3464.194,And then the second opportunity is we are able to leverage our city's staff language capacity.,61,,
364,0.97,3464.194,3466.229,Here is an example.,61,,
365,0.97,3466.229,3518.014,Oira and the office of economic development quickly assembled a Multilingual resource team and they are city staff from the economic development office and also from other city departments to support small business owners in Seattle to help them apply for SBA loans and Ppp loans and then answer questions about what they should do if they lose their revenue and to support them to navigate through city system and then get the resources they need and they are able to support eight languages and then directly work with business owners to address their challenges and issues.,61,,
366,0.97,3518.014,3519.849,"Next slide, please.",61,,
367,0.97,3522.652,3572.235,"And then the third opportunity here is we are able to, because of Covid, we are in need to quickly translate Covid-Related information and then to have our turnaround time in a very short four to eight hours and so we form a team of local community Translators of more than 50 local Translators that we can work directly with to translate up to 20 languages in a very short turnaround time compared to previously it would take two weeks to translate and then now we can have it translated within a day or even shorter.",61,,
368,0.97,3572.235,3577.941,And we tell the state continue to work with community Translators to promptly respond to community needs.,61,,
369,0.97,3580.643,3596.326,And then the fourth opportunity and it's also a longer term opportunity that we see here in the language access system is a centralized language access vision.,61,,
370,0.97,3596.326,3629.359,With the community translator group and then also through working with other city departments to think through the language access to services we are creating a more robust language access Workflow that will allow us to gradually build up our translation knowledge and then build up a Database where today Oira will say something tomorrow that I will be able to share with other city departments.,61,,
371,0.97,3629.359,3638.201,So that is in-house translation shop that will directly provide services to other city departments.,61,,
372,0.97,3638.201,3654.117,This is also because of leadership and also the Mayor's office and the joint Covid relief fund that we are really able to further think through what the increased capacity looked like.,61,,
373,0.97,3654.117,3655.918,"Next slide, please.",61,,
374,0.97,3664.694,3680.943,So we have more positive things coming out from the language access program and we are also able to build up more capacity resources and share it with other city departments.,61,,
375,0.97,3680.943,3687.25,So I included two sites here for people to visit and then get resources and share with their Department.,61,,
376,0.97,3691.954,3701.664,"So with that, that is a quick summary of the language access program and positive outcome.",61,,
377,0.97,3701.664,3704.067,Are there any questions on the program?,61,,
378,0.97,3704.067,3707.67,"Colleagues, any questions or comments on this program?",62,,
379,0.97,3713.643,3715.044,"Council member Mosqueda, please.",62,,
380,0.97,3717.747,3721.084,Just saying thanks again.,63,,
381,0.97,3721.084,3737.266,"I really appreciate the feedback and the Council President said it well, but this is always really exciting to highlight the importance of that shouting that happens at Council in the priority that the Council President mentioned.",63,,
382,0.97,3737.266,3738.835,Thank you for your time today.,63,,
383,0.97,3738.835,3740.236,I'm really excited to see this.,63,,
384,0.97,3740.236,3742.472,Thank you.,64,,
385,0.97,3745.108,3746.008,All right.,65,,
386,0.97,3746.008,3748.211,I think this is our last slide.,65,,
387,0.97,3748.211,3749.245,Can you answer one more?,65,,
388,0.97,3749.245,3752.014,I think there's just a sort of Close-Out slide here.,65,,
389,0.97,3754.283,3754.517,"Oh, no.",65,,
390,0.97,3754.517,3754.817,Here we go.,65,,
391,0.97,3754.817,3757.52,I forgot there was a little bit more.,65,,
392,0.97,3760.423,3823.085,"Council President, this is just taking the opportunities that the partners that we worked with centering our approach with community and we have convened a couple of vaccine Roundtables where we've learned in more detail why our community members or the folks that they work with are choosing or not choosing to get a vaccine and so here are just a few things of what we learned and we thought we would just throw this slide in here because I think a lot of the work that the incredibly talented Oira team just shared with you, our focus now is trying to help the Mayor achieve her vision of reaching a 70% vaccination rate for our city and certainly the work that we need to do to insure that Bipop communities get access to the vaccines will be critical to achieving that goal.",66,,
393,0.97,3823.085,3825.154,I think that is the Wrap-Up for our presentation.,66,,
394,0.97,3825.154,3838.1,"So thank you so much for this opportunity to show you the results and again, I think that Council members can feel proud about the investments made in these programs and the results that we were able to achieve together.",66,,
395,0.97,3841.17,3841.637,Absolutely true.,67,,
396,0.97,3841.637,3853.449,Thank you so much to all of you for being with us today and really appreciate the work obviously that you're doing in terms of equitable vaccine distribution.,67,,
397,0.97,3853.449,3868.531,"We did have an opportunity to hear lots of details about that work from Oira's perspective during our last committee meeting, so appreciate hearing a little bit more about these Roundtables which we had just sort of touched on lately.",67,,
398,0.97,3868.531,3874.57,"Colleagues, either questions or comments for Oira before we shift gears to Deel?",67,,
399,0.97,3874.57,3876.072,Looks like that's it.,67,,
400,0.97,3876.072,3882.411,"Thanks to you, director vu, and to Peggy and Oksana for being with us today, really appreciate all of your hard work.",67,,
401,0.97,3882.411,3889.919,We're going to go ahead and move to our last agenda item which is item four.,67,,
402,0.97,3889.919,3893.256,Will the clerk please read item four into the record.,67,,
403,0.97,3893.256,3898.094,"I'm sorry, yes, item four.",67,,
404,0.97,3898.094,3898.594,Go ahead.,67,,
405,0.97,3898.594,3903.232,Agenda item number 4 birth to 3 and child care strategies for briefing and discussion.,68,,
406,0.97,3903.232,3904.5,Thank you so much.,69,,
407,0.97,3904.5,3904.7,Okay.,69,,
408,0.97,3904.7,3907.103,So this is our last item on the agenda today.,69,,
409,0.97,3907.103,3910.506,It is also just an item for briefing and discussion.,69,,
410,0.97,3910.506,3923.619,So I want to welcome director Chappelle and his Deel team members to committee today and I'm really excited about an opportunity for us to talk about child care and strategies.,69,,
411,0.97,3923.619,3955.885,"This is also another discussion and briefing that flows from direct investments supported by the city council in this space, really excited about hearing more from you all and sharing with the public the different ways that the city can support new families and our youngest learners, those that are the ages 0 to 3, and how we can better meet the child care needs of our young families and families throughout the city.",69,,
412,0.97,3955.885,3969.699,So we know that during this pandemic it has been painfully highlighted how vital child care shortages are and how important child care infrastructure is for our working families across the city.,69,,
413,0.97,3969.699,3973.669,So we have a lot of ground to cover in the subject area.,69,,
414,0.97,3973.669,3986.649,I'm looking forward to this committee discussion and looking forward to figuring out what is next in order to continue to support our families across Seattle.,69,,
415,0.97,3986.649,3990.386,So with that being said going to hand it over to director Chappelle.,69,,
416,0.97,3990.386,3991.087,All right.,70,,
417,0.97,3991.087,3992.088,"Thank you, Council President.",70,,
418,0.97,3992.088,3994.824,It's good to see you.,70,,
419,0.97,3994.824,3995.624,"Good afternoon, Council members.",70,,
420,0.97,3995.624,4011.073,"As always, we're happy to be here to report to you on Deel's prenatal to 3 and child care strategies and we also will be providing you as Council President with an overview of our investment in those areas.",70,,
421,0.97,4011.073,4016.612,Joining me today is our early learning director Monica Liang- Aguirre.,70,,
422,0.97,4016.612,4025.521,"In a moment you'll get a chance to meet our senior policy adviser for early learning, Cameron Clark.",70,,
423,0.97,4025.521,4025.888,"Next slide, please.",70,,
424,0.97,4037.666,4037.967,Thank you.,70,,
425,0.97,4037.967,4057.72,"So our objective today is really just to update you on Deel's recent and ongoing work in these areas that you see up here, prenatal to 3, our child care assistance program, child care stabilization grants and then our ongoing research and outreach.",70,,
426,0.97,4057.72,4058.087,"Next slide, please.",70,,
427,0.97,4059.221,4073.602,So before I hand this off to our early learning director I'd just like to start by reminding you of the two Department results that guided or should I say that guides the work of our early learning division.,70,,
428,0.97,4073.602,4088.551,The first is that all children are ready for kindergarten and the second is all Seattle families have access to high quality and affordable child care.,70,,
429,0.97,4088.551,4095.724,These are the population results that--or should I say the population level results that we want to see from our early learning investments.,70,,
430,0.97,4095.724,4097.56,"Next slide, please.",70,,
431,0.97,4106.368,4116.745,"So what I'll do now is just take a quick moment and pass this off to Monica, our early learning director to, take us from here, talk about our early learning investments.",70,,
432,0.97,4119.081,4119.348,Great.,71,,
433,0.97,4119.348,4136.832,"Good afternoon, Council members, president and Council members, we're glad to be here, a much awaited conversation around our investment in prenatal to 3 investment in child care.",71,,
434,0.97,4136.832,4142.571,Just to continue where Dwane left off I wanted to give an overview of the different bucket of investments that we have.,71,,
435,0.97,4142.571,4144.74,We obviously do invest in preschool heavily.,71,,
436,0.97,4144.74,4162.224,"We also invest in child care, in home visiting, in health and developmental support and then we have a fifth bucket which is around one-time funding which you'll hear about as well and really prenatal to 3 or at least birth to 3 covers everything.",71,,
437,0.97,4162.224,4164.66,It's infused in all of these investment areas.,71,,
438,0.97,4164.66,4171.0,We're not going to touch on preschool even though it does serve 3-Year-Olds because you've heard a lot about preschool in the past.,71,,
439,0.97,4171.0,4190.486,We really want to focus more on some of our less talked about programs and I think what you'll see in our presentation is that we do a lot of different things in this area and we're going to touch lightly on a lot of the different programs and invite an opportunity to speak more about them at a later time if you have questions.,71,,
440,0.97,4190.486,4199.128,"Just to give you an overall look at our budget and how we invest in these, you can see preschool is the biggest have.",71,,
441,0.97,4199.128,4203.766,For early learning followed by child care followed by home visiting and health and developmental.,71,,
442,0.97,4203.766,4211.607,So just to see sort of how it all breaks down in terms of investments.,71,,
443,0.97,4211.607,4225.354,"So I'm going to hand it off to Cameron Clark who is our senior early learning policy adviser, but previously he was our adviser for our birth to 3 investment.",71,,
444,0.97,4225.354,4236.365,So he has a lot of familiarity with the programs he's helped kick off back when the sweetened beverage tax became a reality and started amplifying our investments in this area.,71,,
445,0.97,4236.365,4239.168,"Pass it to you, Cam.",71,,
446,0.97,4239.168,4239.735,Yeah.,72,,
447,0.97,4239.735,4240.569,Thank you very much.,72,,
448,0.97,4240.569,4241.937,Is the power point advancing?,72,,
449,0.97,4241.937,4243.872,I didn't see the budget slide.,72,,
450,0.97,4243.872,4244.373,Is that okay?,72,,
451,0.97,4244.373,4247.61,I guess the next slide after that is where we're at.,72,,
452,0.97,4247.61,4248.877,My apologies.,73,,
453,0.97,4248.877,4250.746,I forgot to advance.,73,,
454,0.97,4250.746,4251.013,Great.,74,,
455,0.97,4251.013,4251.513,"Thank you, Monica.",74,,
456,0.97,4251.513,4256.585,We are excited to share an overview of our work in prenatal to 3 ideal.,74,,
457,0.97,4256.585,4262.558,Going to success and strengthen families with young children in Seattle is crucial to closing opportunity gaps.,74,,
458,0.97,4262.558,4270.966,I think research has found very early childhood experiences matter and set the foundation for all future development.,74,,
459,0.97,4270.966,4274.737,I think in particular crucial brain development occurs in the first few years of life.,74,,
460,0.97,4274.737,4286.582,Establishing a sturdy or fragile foundation is the foundation for all learning health and behavior that follow.,74,,
461,0.97,4286.582,4296.258,Positive and negative interactions which are a major focus especially of our home visiting work and also our coaching and health work in the first three years can really have lasting effects on development.,74,,
462,0.97,4296.258,4308.704,"I think one thing I note is a key difference with a focus of prenatal to 3 versus our Pre-K investment, for example, is that families and Caregivers are oftentimes at the center of our supports and investments.",74,,
463,0.97,4308.704,4310.572,It's the major focus of their work.,74,,
464,0.97,4310.572,4330.326,"You'll see as you move through our program, the Deel have a mixture of program types we fund that provides program support not only directly to children, but also to mothers, to child Caregivers, to child care providers, essentially anyone who spends a lot of time with young children because we think they are crucial to the process as well.",74,,
465,0.97,4330.326,4331.86,I'll go to the next slide.,74,,
466,0.97,4331.86,4333.662,So this is a brief Timeline.,74,,
467,0.97,4333.662,4345.941,The city has been investing or funding programs in Prenatal-3 going back to 2002 with the nurse family partnership which is implemented out of public health Seattle-King County.,74,,
468,0.97,4345.941,4348.944,We added child parenting plus in 2011.,74,,
469,0.97,4348.944,4363.692,It was originally called the parent child home program or Pchp and then the passage in revenue from the sweetened beverage tax in 2018 brought on additional programs.,74,,
470,0.97,4363.692,4372.201,"After 2018 we were able to receive more funds to expand our work in family child plus, family child care, early learning health.",74,,
471,0.97,4372.201,4381.61,In 2021 we have a community grant program we're excited about that's in the planning process.,74,,
472,0.97,4381.61,4385.514,With that and the Timeline Monica and I will briefly walk through our portfolio of work.,74,,
473,0.97,4385.514,4387.549,"Next slide, please.",74,,
474,0.97,4390.319,4402.765,"So our work falls into four categories, home visiting, health and developmental reports, child care or quality care is related to child care and a new addition this year was the community grant program.",74,,
475,0.97,4402.765,4405.734,We'll talk more about the community grant program in a few slides.,74,,
476,0.97,4405.734,4412.841,The work or grants that emerge from that program are likely to cut across these categories and also potentially into new spaces.,74,,
477,0.97,4412.841,4417.679,All our investments have a strong focus on working with families of color.,74,,
478,0.97,4417.679,4419.548,Our Caregivers historically worked with families of color.,74,,
479,0.97,4419.548,4428.624,One of our ongoing goals is to build more connections from these programs to high quality Pre-K experiences.,74,,
480,0.97,4428.624,4433.061,"As Monica mentioned, we'll try and keep our summaries short in the interest of time.",74,,
481,0.97,4433.061,4437.8,We can follow up with information on any of these investments individually.,74,,
482,0.97,4437.8,4438.3,"Next slide, please.",74,,
483,0.97,4438.3,4446.108,"And I believe, yes, Monica is going to walk us through our home visiting work.",74,,
484,0.97,4446.108,4451.914,"So home visiting, as Cam said, is an area we've invested in for quite a while now.",75,,
485,0.97,4451.914,4462.858,"It's a prevention strategy to support pregnant Moms and new parents to promote infant and child health, foster educational development and school readiness and also help prevent child abuse and neglect.",75,,
486,0.97,4462.858,4478.073,The visits typically focus on linking pregnant women with prenatal care or promoting strong Parent/Child attachment and coaching parents on learning activities that foster the child's development and supporting parents' role as their child's first and most important teacher.,75,,
487,0.97,4478.073,4497.826,"What I love about this slide is these are pictures from 2020 of how home visiting has Pivoted to remote practice and generally speaking, home visiting has proven to be even more critical during Covid.",75,,
488,0.97,4497.826,4517.412,"This level of support, this culture of responsive and highly personal support that families are receiving has proven to be extra important, especially with our communities of color and within immigrant and refugee communities that might not otherwise have had access to support and information about what is going on.",75,,
489,0.97,4517.412,4527.322,Overall I think our home visiting providers expected to see a high dropout rate during Covid and surprisingly and pleasantly surprised that actually that wasn't the case.,75,,
490,0.97,4527.322,4543.405,"Some had to drop out, but overall retention was quite high and people have responded that this was again a very important Lifelin connection during this really stressful time.",75,,
491,0.97,4546.508,4586.148,"And Ofand staff also has reported while it's a complete change in practice doing this very Relationship-Based program and having to go remote was really stressful and a lot of barriers to try to get over with the technology, but also there have been some positive things in terms of having families feel more empowered from the Get-Go and really taking leadership in developing their skills and working with their children and our providers have also learned that they needed to provide other kinds of support as well outside of the standard curriculum.",75,,
492,0.97,4586.148,4600.062,"Speaking generally again about home visiting as being--there were some silver Linings in this year, but it's lovely to see that this was a much needed connection that was able to sustain throughout the pandemic.",75,,
493,0.97,4601.029,4606.635,So we have three different types of home visiting programs.,75,,
494,0.97,4606.635,4608.971,"If you could go to the next slide, please.",75,,
495,0.97,4608.971,4622.117,The first and oldest one we've been working with is the nurse family partnership which serves low income women pregnant with a first child and it's actually our only program out of all of our investments that actually works Prenatally.,75,,
496,0.97,4622.117,4630.192,So that's the only thing that gives us the prenatal touch point.,75,,
497,0.97,4630.192,4658.487,"It's implemented by public health sites in the county and regionally and like I said, it's had a big Covid pivot this fast year, but we continue to see positive results in terms of graduation from the--graduating participants who are able to further their education and career goals and also having positive birth outcomes, which is another goal of nurse family partnership.",75,,
498,0.97,4659.321,4661.623,"Next slide, please.",75,,
499,0.97,4665.627,4677.773,So the parent child plus program is our program that is a home visiting program that works through Cbos to provide the service to families.,75,,
500,0.97,4677.773,4698.326,"In general our graduates of the program have been for kindergarten readiness, special education and replace literally, a funding collaborative between best start for kids, United way of King County and the city of Seattle.",75,,
501,0.97,4698.326,4717.746,"This has been a program we continue to invest in and we are working closely with best starts and United way to just increase the support and the infrastructure needed, the technical infrastructure, to really spread this program and to go to this effective program.",75,,
502,0.97,4719.181,4719.981,"Next slide, please.",75,,
503,0.97,4723.585,4733.895,We also back in 2017 we were one of the first cities that piloted a parent child plus model specifically for family child care.,75,,
504,0.97,4733.895,4747.375,"So the theory was that if this program is as effective as it has shown to be with families, what if we apply a similar model to family child care providers for the Home-Based child care providers who work with larger groups of children?",75,,
505,0.97,4747.375,4761.056,So it was adapted from the core model and we started with just a small pilot and the following years doubled the number of family child care providers that we worked with.,75,,
506,0.97,4761.056,4782.944,We've Tweaked the model to meet the needs of the family child care providers who felt for the first time that they were getting some sort of regular professional development and support and that we also extended it to a two-year model because they wanted to make sure they got a little bit more support for a longer amount of time.,75,,
507,0.97,4782.944,4785.447,So that is a Wrap-Up of our home visiting program.,75,,
508,0.97,4785.447,4789.151,So I'll stop here and see if we have any questions.,75,,
509,0.97,4794.122,4795.757,"Any questions or comments, colleagues?",76,,
510,0.97,4796.458,4799.294,"I don't see any hands raised, Monica.",76,,
511,0.97,4799.294,4805.867,I just want to say how excited I am that we continue to fund this particular model.,76,,
512,0.97,4807.969,4857.252,"The numbers sort of show and the results sort of show how important this is to just getting to families, meeting families where they're at and sort of inviting them in a way is culturally and linguistically appropriate for that culture of early learning for the children and we know this is good not just for the kids, but for the whole family and continue to be such a big, big supporter of these kinds of investment models that at one point in time were considered emerging or promising programs and are now looking for us just such a strong Evidence-Based practice and model for us to continue to support.",76,,
513,0.97,4857.252,4870.599,"So really, really grateful for your all's ongoing work and partnership with external partners to continue to make this a real strong investment in the program.",76,,
514,0.97,4870.599,4874.636,"So, Cam, do you want to continue talking about our other investments?",77,,
515,0.97,4874.636,4874.903,Sure.,78,,
516,0.97,4874.903,4876.371,I can go to the next slide.,78,,
517,0.97,4876.371,4880.175,Actually I will add one thing about parent child plus as we go on.,78,,
518,0.97,4880.175,4894.656,"It has been a pretty successful as we adapted the family child care providers and now there's a lot of discussion at the national level whether we could adapt it to other populations like family friend and neighbor providers particularly, also populations that are incarcerated.",78,,
519,0.97,4894.656,4899.361,"So it is really thinking about how we continue to leverage that version, model.",78,,
520,0.97,4903.164,4903.632,"Next slide, please.",78,,
521,0.97,4903.632,4908.169,So I will kind of talk through the rest of our prenatal to 3 investments.,78,,
522,0.97,4908.169,4911.573,"The first one, we have two in health and developmental supports.",78,,
523,0.97,4911.573,4913.074,The first is the developmental bridge.,78,,
524,0.97,4913.074,4916.645,It's another one of our kind of exciting new pilot initiatives.,78,,
525,0.97,4916.645,4919.381,We refer to it as the bridge.,78,,
526,0.97,4919.381,4928.49,It's Overseen by King County and implemented by the Bowyers children clinic in addition with our part C providers.,78,,
527,0.97,4928.49,4929.891,It's a really challenging program to explain.,78,,
528,0.97,4929.891,4932.694,It involves a lot of different systems and eligibility.,78,,
529,0.97,4932.694,4944.539,"At a high level it was designed with King County disabilities division and Deel to support families that are falling through the cracks of the part C system, so the 0 to 3 system.",78,,
530,0.97,4944.539,4952.314,It's a fairly new program going through its third year and demand has really spiked with Covid and we expect that to continue as services continue to be interrupted.,78,,
531,0.97,4952.314,4957.986,The program has been well received by participating families particularly this year with many families stuck at home.,78,,
532,0.97,4957.986,4961.389,We expected to serve about 60 to 75 families this year.,78,,
533,0.97,4961.389,4974.836,We ended up serving about 120 families as we went through.,78,,
534,0.97,4974.836,4979.407,"Next slide, please.",78,,
535,0.97,4979.407,4982.11,Our second investment in health and development support is early learning health.,78,,
536,0.97,4982.11,4987.816,We've been working with the child care health program of public health Seattle King County a number of years.,78,,
537,0.97,4987.816,4992.32,They're actually one of the first programs that implemented child care health consultation.,78,,
538,0.97,4992.32,4993.922,I believe they are the worst.,78,,
539,0.97,4993.922,5008.002,"We've been working with them in our Pre-K program and they are a phenomenal multi disciplinary team of nurses, mental health consultants, community health workers and Nutritionists that focus on early childhood of public health.",78,,
540,0.97,5008.002,5016.978,The sweet beverage tax allowed us to expand the team to birth to 3 focus working with infants and toddlers.,78,,
541,0.97,5016.978,5027.355,"They focus on health consultation and child development, mental health, nutrition and interpreting and complying with pretty complex licensing regulations.",78,,
542,0.97,5027.355,5033.995,During Covid it became a Go-To resource supporting providers individually in the field collectively.,78,,
543,0.97,5033.995,5047.042,Particularly the nurses at Cchp as we call it created the first Covid-19 guidance for B3 and other providers in late January 2020 and then continuously updated that guidance as science evolved throughout the year.,78,,
544,0.97,5047.042,5050.979,They have some really incredible stories.,78,,
545,0.97,5050.979,5061.022,They did become the preeminent resource around public health and Covid around the early childhood community and birth to 3 community in 2020 and continue to be so in 2021.,78,,
546,0.97,5061.022,5063.224,"Next slide, please.",78,,
547,0.97,5065.927,5074.536,So we're talking about Ccap moving to quality supports.,78,,
548,0.97,5074.536,5082.243,"If we want to make inroads on continuing to close the opportunity gap, we need child care to be high quality.",78,,
549,0.97,5082.243,5100.028,Similar to the child care health program Deel has been providing cultural responsive coaching to our Spt program since the 2018 levy allowing us to focus to our birth to 3 focus.,78,,
550,0.97,5100.028,5103.665,Our model offers in classroom coaching and professional development.,78,,
551,0.97,5103.665,5121.449,"The coaching is to prove educator and Caregiver practice, create high quality Nurturing and learning environments, promote healthy child development ultimately leading to long term positive child outcomes limited currently to 30 in the classrooms.",78,,
552,0.97,5121.449,5124.919,There's a Cohort model that moves through each year.,78,,
553,0.97,5124.919,5137.499,"On the training decide we offer them in line with the Washington state core Competencies for professionals to enhance educator knowledge, skills and abilities and will expand in 2021.",78,,
554,0.97,5137.499,5143.605,I think the one thing I would point out is there was a major gap for infant and toddler work.,78,,
555,0.97,5143.605,5150.278,I mean the lion's share of investment and supports have all been around Pre-K both at the state and city level.,78,,
556,0.97,5150.278,5153.681,So this has filled a tremendous need for the community.,78,,
557,0.97,5154.782,5157.685,Let's move on to the next slide.,78,,
558,0.97,5159.42,5175.036,"To talk about our newest program which is not even in implementation yet, so the prenatal to 3 community grant program, there new funding originated from a recommendation from the sweetened beverage tax community advisory board.",78,,
559,0.97,5175.036,5186.18,"Right now it's one-time the desire is it to create opportunities for community design, ideas and solutions that can be accessed by Community-Based organizations like the funding.",78,,
560,0.97,5186.18,5193.488,The theory is those closest to the community should have a big role in designing supports for the community that they work with.,78,,
561,0.97,5193.488,5213.141,"So we are working now closely with--there was a community engagement effort to make this recommendation and now we're working with the Advisory board, best starts for kids to design a funding model as well as review other related city funding opportunities.",78,,
562,0.97,5213.141,5214.042,Planning is ongoing.,78,,
563,0.97,5214.042,5217.645,We just made an Rfp available this summer for the funding Oportunity.,78,,
564,0.97,5218.88,5226.287,With that I believe I will turn it back to Monica on the next slide to talk about the child care assistance program.,78,,
565,0.97,5228.656,5231.125,Thank you.,79,,
566,0.97,5231.125,5238.533,I'll give you a general overview of plans that we had and have for the Ccap program.,79,,
567,0.97,5238.533,5243.504,You can go to the next slide.,79,,
568,0.97,5243.504,5247.442,"So 2020 again threw everything a little bit into a Tizzy for us, of course.",79,,
569,0.97,5247.442,5255.65,This was supposed to be the year that we were going to do a pretty extensive expansion.,79,,
570,0.97,5255.65,5258.386,We increased our subsidy budget to serve 600 more children.,79,,
571,0.97,5258.386,5276.004,We were going to provide professional development and financial incentives for providers and increased eligibility for families up to 350% of Federal poverty level and prepared a much more robust outreach plan to meet this expansion goal.,79,,
572,0.97,5276.004,5289.117,"When Covid hit, the needs of our providers and our families just changed drastically and we were still able to change the eligibility and provide incentives, but our professional development was put on hold.",79,,
573,0.97,5289.117,5295.523,And we also just had to do a strong pivot to provide supports due to Covid.,79,,
574,0.97,5295.523,5308.302,So we'll talk a little bit about some of our immediate Covid responses and then we'll talk about our ongoing utilization of Ccap and plans for the future.,79,,
575,0.97,5308.302,5309.937,"Go to the next slide, please.",79,,
576,0.97,5309.937,5329.057,"As I don't need to tell you, our child care industry was really impacted negatively by the child care--by the pandemic and at the very, very beginning Ppe access was a primary concern for our providers when everything was--especially when supplies were so scarce at the beginning.",79,,
577,0.97,5329.057,5348.743,We held two separate supply distribution events for our early learning and child care providers and were able to really give them much needed supplies at a time when they could not either find them or afford them.,79,,
578,0.97,5348.743,5356.951,We also made some Pivots in our policies with Ccap to support providers.,79,,
579,0.97,5356.951,5365.827,We started paying for enrollment versus attendance since April 2020 to help providers rely on full payments for the months without Burdening families for additional payments.,79,,
580,0.97,5365.827,5371.165,We continued to pay subsidies for children even when the site is closed due to Covid exposure.,79,,
581,0.97,5371.165,5384.645,We just wanted to give providers some more regular income stream and then we also changed policies for families.,79,,
582,0.97,5384.645,5395.123,"As you know, at the end of 2020 for November, December we waived the Co-Pay for families completely for Ccap.",79,,
583,0.97,5395.123,5398.926,So it was completely free for families.,79,,
584,0.97,5398.926,5404.632,Now January through June of 2021 their Co-Pays have all been reduced by 50%.,79,,
585,0.97,5404.632,5422.884,"So this has been a welcome policy shift for families, as you can imagine, who have really felt the brunt of the constraints the pandemic has really put on everybody.",79,,
586,0.97,5422.884,5431.759,"On that family Co-Pay relief component, that's like across the system for Ccap.",80,,
587,0.97,5431.759,5436.03,"So in other words, Ccap is already sort of means --",80,,
588,0.97,5436.03,5436.33,Exactly.,81,,
589,0.97,5436.33,5440.701,So it's sort of across the board universal?,82,,
590,0.97,5440.701,5441.636,Yes.,83,,
591,0.97,5441.636,5448.009,Or families are between 200 to 350% able to qualify to begin with.,83,,
592,0.97,5448.009,5450.378,Everybody had a small Co-Pay.,83,,
593,0.97,5450.378,5456.717,So they were either eliminated completely or now they're 50% off.,83,,
594,0.97,5456.717,5457.218,Great.,84,,
595,0.97,5457.218,5458.019,Yeah.,85,,
596,0.97,5458.019,5469.797,And then Cam will talk about the child care stabilization fund that we just are wrapping up right now and it was a big boon to our sector.,85,,
597,0.97,5469.797,5472.4,"Next slide, please.",86,,
598,0.97,5475.002,5476.704,Great.,86,,
599,0.97,5476.704,5477.004,Thank you.,86,,
600,0.97,5477.004,5486.08,"We're going to talk briefly about the stabilization fund before I throw it back to Monica, going back and forth to, review Ccap utilization.",86,,
601,0.97,5486.08,5494.188,Deel began designing a Covid relief program to issue a child care stabilization grant fund last fall through funds allocated by Council.,86,,
602,0.97,5494.188,5507.335,The overall intent was to provide stabilization funding to the child care community that stayed open amid the challenges of the pandemic.,86,,
603,0.97,5507.335,5521.249,The key tenets of the program was to provide child care for the family.,86,,
604,0.97,5521.249,5521.682,Next slide please.,86,,
605,0.97,5521.682,5527.955,Deel worked with child care resources to administer the child care stabilization grant program.,86,,
606,0.97,5527.955,5529.991,They actually administered two other stabilization grant programs.,86,,
607,0.97,5529.991,5537.999,They were a good partner in this effort and then program is for licensed child care providers and family friend and neighbor providers.,86,,
608,0.97,5537.999,5551.479,"2.4Million was allocated for the fund with $100,000 reserved for family friend and neighbor providers with a maximum grant of $500 and the remaining was allocated to licensed child care providers with maximum grants of $10,000.",86,,
609,0.97,5551.479,5569.597,"Just briefly because family friend and neighbor isn't a common term for a lot of people, it's a type of care very common with young children, essentially an individual providing regular care at least ten hours a week who is not a Guardian or parent, could be a grandmother, aunt, neighbor, et cetera.",86,,
610,0.97,5569.597,5573.367,It's heavily used and accessed by the immigrant community in Seattle.,86,,
611,0.97,5573.367,5578.039,The grant applications closed January 27th for child care and January 29th for family friend and neighbor.,86,,
612,0.97,5578.94,5581.242,"Next slide, please.",86,,
613,0.97,5587.114,5601.062,"Awards for license providers varied in size between $5,000 and $10,000 depending on license capacity, essentially how large you were being the biggest defense definition of how much money you received.",86,,
614,0.97,5601.062,5608.035,"Additional was if you provided extra hours child care or provided transportation on state, city or homeless subsidy.",86,,
615,0.97,5608.035,5617.278,"The average award site for school aged programs was $6,528 which indicates a lot of our providers were family child care providers because they were on the smaller side.",86,,
616,0.97,5617.278,5625.886,Child care resources is are currently processing award grants as we speak and will be issuing checks this month I think in the next two weeks.,86,,
617,0.97,5625.886,5633.928,So child care providers have been--I just want to note a few more things before I wrap there up--child care providers truly have been on the front line and essential workers.,86,,
618,0.97,5633.928,5637.732,"If there's a definition of that, they certainly need that during this crisis.",86,,
619,0.97,5637.732,5645.539,"We really appreciate the Council appropriating these funds for the financially fragile sector even in good times, let alone in Covid.",86,,
620,0.97,5645.539,5657.518,I'd also NOTE we're also optimistic with the near passage of the Federal stimulus bill we hope that additional stabilization funding will be coming down for the child care community this year through the state as well.,86,,
621,0.97,5658.986,5662.023,Any questions on that before we move on?,86,,
622,0.97,5668.095,5671.899,"Council member Mosqueda, please.",87,,
623,0.97,5671.899,5672.466,You're still on mute.,87,,
624,0.97,5672.466,5673.134,There we go.,87,,
625,0.97,5673.134,5677.505,A year later and still cannot pull it all together.,88,,
626,0.97,5677.505,5678.372,Thank you so much.,88,,
627,0.97,5678.372,5702.463,"I just wondered and apologies if you have already included this in your presentation, but given the National Statistics that we continue to see about 40% of all the child care saying that they're going to close and close for good potentially last summer, do we have any indication of the impact in Seattle both in terms of closures and parents who won't be able to find child care as they try to reenter the workplace?",88,,
628,0.97,5702.463,5709.637,"I know this is also a big deal not just for workers, but small businesses who are seeking to reopen that have come up.",88,,
629,0.97,5709.637,5717.278,Do we have any hyper local data on the number of child cares that are saying they might not be able to reopen again?,88,,
630,0.97,5717.278,5720.781,We can get you really more specific data.,89,,
631,0.97,5720.781,5725.252,I will say in Seattle has not been hit as hard as other parts of the state.,89,,
632,0.97,5725.252,5729.623,We aren't seeing numbers up in the 40%.,89,,
633,0.97,5729.623,5737.598,"Our Ccap providers--and Monica, jump in if it comes top of mind for you--we have only seen very few closures among our 200Ccap providers.",89,,
634,0.97,5737.598,5742.436,So I think we've been a little more fortunate in Seattle around child care closures.,89,,
635,0.97,5742.436,5745.306,There have been some but not to that same degree.,89,,
636,0.97,5745.306,5748.042,There are I believe some more hyper local statistics.,89,,
637,0.97,5748.042,5749.677,We can get that to you.,89,,
638,0.97,5749.677,5750.277,Yeah.,90,,
639,0.97,5750.277,5752.48,That would be great.,90,,
640,0.97,5752.48,5753.114,I think you're right.,90,,
641,0.97,5753.114,5778.139,"Washington state overall is not as bad as some of those National Statistics between 14 and 24% of child care saying it's not going to open, which is still huge, but that would be wonderful to know what the hyper local child care situation looks like, especially given the headlines that we saw the year before about there being record numbers of Kiddos born in the city of Seattle.",90,,
642,0.97,5778.139,5789.283,"I'm very appreciative of our child care being open and very grateful that the child care providers are now able to get access to vaccines as well, just thought that would be a helpful STAT to have on hand.",90,,
643,0.97,5789.283,5802.997,"Council member Mosqueda, I had pursued a similar line of questioning with Deel when I saw some of the headlines that were specific to Washington State and they do have that information available.",91,,
644,0.97,5802.997,5820.881,"They might not have it--Monica might not have it at the sort of end of her Cursor right now, but I know that that information--that hyper local information is available because I've seen it and would just ask that folks follow up by sending your office an Email with those statistics.",91,,
645,0.97,5827.188,5851.845,"Definitely fairing way better than the county, way better than the state, way better than the National scene and I think honestly that's a Testament to the fact that we have, you know, we probably had a baseline Ecosystem that was a little bit stronger than in some areas in terms of child care provider support and Whatnot.",91,,
646,0.97,5851.845,5867.628,"That doesn't mean we're, you know, in the homeland as they say in terms of being able to do more, but I think the impact here has been not as deep as it has been in other parts of the country.",91,,
647,0.97,5869.797,5870.364,Go ahead.,91,,
648,0.97,5870.364,5871.599,"Thank you, Madam President.",92,,
649,0.97,5871.599,5908.102,"Just a quick Followup because now we got the wheels turning here, given the data we've already seen about child care deserts throughout the country and looking again hyper local in Seattle, it just made me think if you do also in your follow-up have any data on what your indicators would show would be the needed number of child care centers in the city to address the unmet need before, that would also be helpful as we look at where there might be a gap and where we need to actually go even before Covid.",92,,
650,0.97,5908.102,5909.103,So thank you again.,92,,
651,0.97,5909.103,5916.644,"I know that's not exactly something that we Preidentified for this presentation, but if you're able to share that, that would be wonderful.",92,,
652,0.97,5916.644,5940.868,You will be very excited to hear that one of the very important budget actions that we got passed in 2019 is specifically on that issue and we gave Deel some funding and I have two beautiful reports sitting on my table that sort of previews some strategies and recommendations in that area.,93,,
653,0.97,5940.868,5941.935,So that's the policy question.,93,,
654,0.97,5941.935,5943.404,You hit it right on the nose.,93,,
655,0.97,5943.404,5979.94,We have an opportunity to really do a Scan of the environment and the Ecosystem to evaluate where there are child care deserts and pockets within our own city and Deel has been working on that all of last year and we have a comment to this Committee in the spring with some really clear identified strategies to address any identified needs through this sort of academic research Community-Based effort here.,93,,
656,0.97,5979.94,5984.044,So our wheels are turning in the same direction and that makes me very happy.,93,,
657,0.97,5985.846,5986.28,Thank you.,94,,
658,0.97,5986.28,5989.583,You just covered the end of our presentation.,94,,
659,0.97,5989.583,5990.084,There you go.,95,,
660,0.97,5990.084,5991.919,"We'll skip that slide, but Yeah.",96,,
661,0.97,5991.919,5998.125,There's a lot of work going on right now in this sector.,96,,
662,0.97,5998.125,6012.84,"It's highly complex, many different levers right now and so we'll be excited in a few months to come back and give you all of our great ideas based on this project that you helped us do.",96,,
663,0.97,6012.84,6025.686,So let's continue and I'll just talk a little bit about Ccap utilization which may also help frame around what the current reality is around Ccap and our child care providers in the city.,96,,
664,0.97,6025.686,6034.728,"If you could go to the next slide, this slide really just--that's not the slide.",96,,
665,0.97,6034.728,6034.928,Yeah.,96,,
666,0.97,6034.928,6036.897,There we go.,96,,
667,0.97,6040.167,6042.703,"So just shows the real picture of Covid, right?",96,,
668,0.97,6042.703,6054.481,"The top of the dark blue mine is 2020 and you can see in March we were at 555 and then it just kind of went, just plummeted.",96,,
669,0.97,6054.481,6061.221,Over the summer we were down in the 300S.,96,,
670,0.97,6061.221,6068.796,"That is because families, very rightfully is, decided we're going to do whatever it takes not to send our children to congregate care.",96,,
671,0.97,6068.796,6076.67,It was the families of essential workers that really truly had no choice who have to continue sending their children.,96,,
672,0.97,6076.67,6108.202,"So this was, of course, one of the reasons why child care providers are in such trouble is because their enrollment went down, but it tells a really strong story about just the demand and what families are comfortable doing, especially vis-a-vis what the schools were doing and how to understand what families are comfortable--how they're comfortable sending their children to care at this time.",96,,
673,0.97,6108.202,6109.269,So our enrollment dropped 30%.,96,,
674,0.97,6109.269,6112.172,We were supposed to expand in 2020.,96,,
675,0.97,6112.172,6114.308,That did not happen.,96,,
676,0.97,6114.308,6114.775,We went down 30%.,96,,
677,0.97,6114.775,6144.738,"So if you go to the next slide, this talks a little bit about our age distribution and this has been a big talking point for a while now with Council member Gonzalez about the difference in how many infants and toddlers we're schooling versus preschool and school age.",96,,
678,0.97,6144.738,6162.99,We still continue to serve mostly preschool and school age children with far fewer infants and toddlers and the real focus of the Council budget add that we were just discussing was around making access for infant care more affordable and more accessible to families here in Seattle.,96,,
679,0.97,6162.99,6170.864,We're going to be talking a lot about that when we come back.,96,,
680,0.97,6170.864,6185.612,"Interestingly, this is the first time in Seattle that actually infant care is available and there are no wait lists and if you actually want to send your infant to child care, right now is the time to do it.",96,,
681,0.97,6185.612,6187.915,Many of our providers have vacancies.,96,,
682,0.97,6187.915,6196.757,"That's unheard of previously, but again shows that families are not ready to send their infants to congregate care at this time.",96,,
683,0.97,6196.757,6198.992,Yeah.,97,,
684,0.97,6198.992,6212.339,What a change in circumstances from previous years where you had to get on wait lists when you were pregnant in order to even have a fighting chance for it.,97,,
685,0.97,6212.339,6226.153,"So obviously on the demand side on the family side good news if you're ready for congregate care, but also paints a very different picture for providers who are really struggling in this moment.",97,,
686,0.97,6227.988,6244.538,"If you go to the next slide, please, this just is a breakdown of the Dem graphic of cap and age.",98,,
687,0.97,6244.538,6250.377,"Over 86% of our children are of color, our largest group being African-American or black or African.",98,,
688,0.97,6250.377,6257.317,"Just as a note, this is the last time that you will see our data desegregated this broadly.",98,,
689,0.97,6257.317,6279.506,"We literally just this week Transitioned to another Database system that is going to allow us to continue with the Fed 7 and other but will also allow participants to Self- identify as Middle Eastern, North African or also share more detail about their heritage such as whether they're identified as South Asian or East African.",98,,
690,0.97,6279.506,6287.014,That's going to help us rectify some of the Disconnects between our demographics and our language which you'll see in a minute.,98,,
691,0.97,6287.014,6305.365,"So we still can't understand too much with the way it's broken down right now, but if you go to the next slide is about language and overwhelmingly all of our families identify as English speaking.",98,,
692,0.97,6305.365,6319.079,"Again, once we have a better understanding of some of our race and Ethnicity data with the new system, we'll be able to understand that story a little better.",98,,
693,0.97,6319.079,6329.89,We also know that there are just families who hesitate to indicate what language they speak at home because it is a public program.,98,,
694,0.97,6329.89,6338.899,That continues to be an area that we're trying to understand better and analyze.,98,,
695,0.97,6338.899,6347.307,"Monica, on this particular issue, so I appreciate that the question as framed is what language is primarily spoken at home.",99,,
696,0.97,6347.307,6359.419,"Is there any sort of survey or understanding of what language people want their children, infants and toddlers, to learn in?",99,,
697,0.97,6359.419,6372.232,"So in other words, like if you had a choice of, you know, immersion or bilingual program, what language would you prefer, has that question been posed?",99,,
698,0.97,6372.232,6374.868,Do we collect that data?,99,,
699,0.97,6374.868,6375.135,Yeah.,100,,
700,0.97,6375.135,6376.436,I am not entirely sure.,100,,
701,0.97,6376.436,6377.204,I'll double check that.,100,,
702,0.97,6377.204,6381.575,I don't think that is a question we ask for our child care.,100,,
703,0.97,6381.575,6396.89,"That is absolutely for our Seattle preschool program where we have dual language programs very specifically designed to teach in two or more languages, but I'll have to get back to you about whether or not that's an option for Ccap.",100,,
704,0.97,6396.89,6397.157,Yeah.,101,,
705,0.97,6397.157,6404.598,I'd like to see if it is.,101,,
706,0.97,6404.598,6425.252,"I know for our family we were very interested in identifying a provider who had a Spanish immersion curriculum and really challenging to find that in certain parts of Seattle, certainly can say it was difficult to find in West Seattle where I live.",101,,
707,0.97,6425.252,6435.629,So I'm just wondering whether there's an opportunity to sort of understand this language component by asking that preference.,101,,
708,0.97,6435.629,6456.149,"That doesn't necessarily mean that that's the language that's spoken at home, but I still think it gives us an important data point of sort of both the provider network that might be available and also sort of the language preference in terms of curriculum from the family's side as well.",101,,
709,0.97,6456.149,6456.55,That's great.,102,,
710,0.97,6456.55,6460.587,"Well, let us know when your daughter is ready for preschool.",103,,
711,0.97,6460.587,6463.957,We have some great dual language programs available.,103,,
712,0.97,6463.957,6470.03,We've got two years to go.,104,,
713,0.97,6470.03,6470.597,Trust me.,104,,
714,0.97,6470.597,6477.971,"So the next slide, I just wanted to give a quick summary of these.",105,,
715,0.97,6477.971,6482.943,"We have three big initiatives, council initiatives, that were funded in 2020.",105,,
716,0.97,6487.013,6497.891,Obviously block was delayed because of Covid and we picked up that ball again because of 2020.,105,,
717,0.97,6497.891,6506.967,"The child care Cvas, two separate ones, one focusing more on Ccap and some of the ways we can increase access to infant and toddler care.",105,,
718,0.97,6506.967,6521.248,Another one was more of a national survey to look at other on jurisdictions to look for other ideas in terms of how to increase access.,105,,
719,0.97,6521.248,6526.086,Both are well underway as you know.,105,,
720,0.97,6526.086,6543.837,"The President has the reports on her desk, very, very in depth surveys of different approaches, different case studies by cities and we have an internal work group right now that is Triaging a lot of ideas and recommendations.",105,,
721,0.97,6543.837,6549.075,I call it sort of the Email.,105,,
722,0.97,6549.075,6559.986,"We're trying to Disstill it into something very tangible, things that are really appropriate for the Seattle context, things that are accessible to us in the near future versus long term.",105,,
723,0.97,6559.986,6572.165,So that's all coming to you later this spring and then we're working on another slide on the labor hardening agreement language.,105,,
724,0.97,6572.165,6579.039,That's a process we picked up the end of 2020 and is on the roll right now.,105,,
725,0.97,6579.039,6584.711,We are collaborating closely with Sbu 925 to establish the process and partner in this work.,105,,
726,0.97,6584.711,6599.125,We put together a steering committee of very diverse Stakeholders in the community to help us guide the process and actually that has been--was a really great decision and is super informative.,105,,
727,0.97,6599.125,6603.53,It's a very complex topic and we're really digging in.,105,,
728,0.97,6603.53,6610.503,More broad outreach is happening this month and next month as well.,105,,
729,0.97,6610.503,6613.473,So we're looking forward to coming back with updates on that as well.,105,,
730,0.97,6617.444,6625.218,"And then finally I just want to acknowledge that, you know, child care is--we're working within a larger Ecosystem.",105,,
731,0.97,6625.218,6635.562,We have the county with the best art for kids coming up for renewal and they are proposing the resurrection of their child care subsidy program.,105,,
732,0.97,6635.562,6647.073,So we're going to be Partnering with them to align and make sure that we're collaborating as much as possible and making that a benefit for all families.,105,,
733,0.97,6647.073,6655.215,"So that is on the horizon, as is some more state funding for the working connections program.",105,,
734,0.97,6655.215,6668.828,"So we're trying to stay afloat--not stay afloat, stay ahead of all the different policy pieces that are moving regionally as well, see that we're in alignment and being as resourceful as possible.",105,,
735,0.97,6673.7,6678.738,And I believe that concludes all the work that we're doing in prenatal to 3 and child care.,105,,
736,0.97,6678.738,6695.855,"I know we threw a lot at you and apologize that we kind of rushed through it, but if there's anything you want to follow up on--you've identified a few things already--please let us know.",105,,
737,0.97,6695.855,6696.122,Yeah.,106,,
738,0.97,6696.122,6698.558,I think a council member might have a comment or question.,106,,

742,0.97,6737.697,6749.142,So I really appreciate the work that Deel has put into these discussions and I know that community members including folks from the labor community very much appreciate that as well.,107,,
743,0.97,6749.142,6770.597,"I think those conversations combined with the demonstration projects to the county's best starts for kids levy give us a real shot at having child care workers have the money that they need to stay in these jobs, have greater longevity and in turn our Kiddos turn our system into a more equitable system for all Kiddos.",107,,
