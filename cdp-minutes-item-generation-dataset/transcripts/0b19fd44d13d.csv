18,0.97,69.002,102.635,"The second is a briefing from the human services Department on the process and outcomes of the community safety capacity building request for proposals, funded with $12 million provided by the city Council, in part in last year's summer budget adjustment, with the Council increasing the funding in 2021, when that 2020 funding was vetoed by the Mayor and not allocated in 2020.",10,,
19,0.97,102.635,112.312,I know we're also glad to see that the human services Department has gotten those dollars out into the community.,10,,

25,0.97,191.024,193.56,Or 40 speakers.,10,,
26,0.97,193.56,201.434,I think we should reduce comment period speaking for one minute for each Speaker.,10,,
27,0.97,201.434,208.675,It will require us to also make an adjustment in the time allotted for public comment on the agenda.,10,,
28,0.97,208.675,216.182,"I will call on each Speaker by name, and in the order in which they registered on the Council's Website.",10,,

38,0.97,283.616,292.992,We've got many more people signed up for public comment than we can accommodate in the normal 20 minute public comment period.,10,,
39,0.97,292.992,300.233,"So in order to allow as many people to speak as possible, potentially, everybody.",10,,
40,0.97,300.233,315.248,"If there are no objections, I will suspend the rules to allow an additional 20 minutes of public comment, extending public comment to be a total of 40 minutes.",10,,

49,0.97,357.824,368.401,"We learned just how Self- serving bureaucratic, and Internallistic this $9 million system is protecting both itself and the SPD from the community.",11,,
50,0.97,368.401,376.576,This reveals a complete dereliction of duty along with possible criminal acts committed by OPA director.,11,,
51,0.97,376.576,388.588,Vick's article reveals in one of the more horrendous assaults against protesters last year.,11,,
52,0.97,388.588,401.334,"The OPA attempts to blame the victim and Criminally release her private health records, precisely the opposite of job.",11,,
53,0.97,401.334,409.509,This demonstrates urgent need for us to have full civility control over the conduct and discipline.,11,,

61,0.97,453.719,464.43,"All right, we're going to have to move on to Peter Condit, followed by BJ lass.",15,,
62,0.97,464.43,469.802,We'll come back to Jason towards the end of public comment.,15,,

64,0.97,472.238,482.114,"I'm a district 6 resident, I'm writing to ask you to transfer all 15 plus million dollars in salary savings out of the Seattle police Department.",16,,
65,0.97,482.114,489.755,"They will raise many questions, particularly regarding the more than $2 million that would be spent on cop technology.",16,,
66,0.97,489.755,490.623,Cops don't need new Tech.,16,,
67,0.97,490.623,494.56,One of those items is a capacity planning tool.,16,,
68,0.97,494.56,508.441,Accenture writes that it is to be used to solve the problem of when quote the chief of police cannot currently defend with evidence her request for additional budget.,16,,
69,0.97,508.441,509.075,End quote.,16,,
70,0.97,509.075,513.513,Is SPD asking for technology to fabricate budgetary need that doesn't otherwise exist?,16,,
71,0.97,513.513,514.046,I think so.,16,,
72,0.97,514.046,524.824,"On the other hand, community already has evidence of its budgetary need through applied to the building grants.",16,,
73,0.97,524.824,534.634,Keeping salary savings within SPD does not get us closer to true public safety for all.,16,,
74,0.97,534.634,544.543,Spd is a Destructional force in our society that employs --,16,,

79,0.97,557.456,567.433,"The Mayor allocated SPD salary savings not surprisingly, they're directing almost all of those dollars back into SPD which RAISES many questions.",18,,
80,0.97,567.433,577.076,The recent report by the National criminal justice reform says three quarters of all calls for service could be handled exclusively.,18,,
81,0.97,577.076,580.446,What steps are being taken to create this network?,18,,
82,0.97,580.446,583.95,How could the $15.3 million be used towards this recommendation?,18,,
83,0.97,583.95,596.228,What is the basis for the decision to spend on hiring bonuses that will increase the number of sworn officers instead of spending on Nonofficer alternatives.,18,,
84,0.97,596.228,599.065,Seattle is in a crucial spot.,18,,
85,0.97,599.065,608.074,Keeping salary savings within SPD does not get us closer to true public safety for all.,18,,

87,0.97,619.418,626.258,"My name is Cbron page, I'm a jig worker.",20,,
88,0.97,626.258,631.464,I'm hear to speak about why we need Seattle Council to pass the policy.,20,,
89,0.97,631.464,635.434,"As an independent contractor, I incur all of the expenses of doing this work, of course.",20,,
90,0.97,635.434,641.307,A single accident can take away your ability to do this work.,20,,
91,0.97,641.307,646.412,There aren't any predictions to jig workers especially if you get hurt or have an accident.,20,,
92,0.97,646.412,649.048,"I'm a good driver, but life happens, accidents happen.",20,,
93,0.97,649.048,657.69,"I happened to have pulled back on doing this, because of the expensive wear and tear mileage in my car.",20,,

97,0.97,676.509,684.383,"We need as workers, standards must be set in place before whole new generations of people --",20,,

103,0.97,699.565,711.11,I'm calling because I'm very concerned about SPD's request to allocate savings back into their budget when the Council mass committed to building true public safety outside of SPD.,22,,
104,0.97,711.11,714.28,The Mayor's new budget request for our city RAISES many questions.,22,,
105,0.97,714.28,721.721,"One of them is a part of the technology funding, SPD is asking the city to fund an early intervention system.",22,,
106,0.97,721.721,726.759,This system supposedly catches bad cops before they do bad things.,22,,
107,0.97,726.759,729.495,"There is zero evidence, however, that EIS even works.",22,,
108,0.97,729.495,734.333,The Dij has previously declared it to be a stale program.,22,,
109,0.97,734.333,748.948,"Why would the city spend on police technology that is already proven to fail, when we know there are alternatives out there as demonstrated through the project with all of the community organizations.",22,,
110,0.97,748.948,751.417,That can solve public safety outside of SPD.,22,,
111,0.97,751.417,751.917,Thank you.,22,,
112,0.97,751.917,761.66,"Thank you, our next Speaker is Terry Herstat, followed by Jacob Brasheer.",23,,

116,0.97,777.009,788.654,"I used to work primarily on Instacart, but I was deactivated, and they did not disclose the action that led to my Deactivation.",26,,
117,0.97,788.654,793.392,It's possible to have a balanced relationship with App companies.,26,,
118,0.97,793.392,799.765,"Unfortunately, not all App companies play fair and continuously harm worker profits.",26,,

129,0.97,853.385,863.195,"As an organization is that works with low income House community, we know the threat that SPD poses through displacing and Traumatizing people.",28,,
130,0.97,863.195,864.263,And sustained racist violence.,28,,
131,0.97,864.263,870.936,"We reject the idea that SPD exists to provide public safety, and demand that Council follow through.",28,,
132,0.97,870.936,879.078,That begins with pouring an investing in programs that meet basic needs and respond to structural causes of inequality.,28,,
133,0.97,879.078,883.148,The precise opposite of what the Seattle police Department does.,28,,
134,0.97,883.148,886.952,They need housing and services that meet their specific needs.,28,,
135,0.97,886.952,888.387,That's what true public safety is.,28,,
136,0.97,888.387,891.69,The demand from the community remains the same.,28,,
137,0.97,891.69,895.194,Defund SPD and invest in true public safety.,28,,
138,0.97,895.194,895.894,Thank you.,28,,

147,0.97,928.06,936.035,"However, I wanted to emphasize the overlap and some of the shared concerns among all gig workers.",30,,
148,0.97,936.035,940.806,"As a rider, I do have gaps in my contract here and there.",30,,
149,0.97,940.806,946.412,"A couple years ago, I signed up O be a Lyft driver, thinking that would help even out the income.",30,,
150,0.97,946.412,950.449,And I was shocked at how little I was paid.,30,,
151,0.97,950.449,959.291,"You know, I was expecting to get about $20 an hour, and after expenses, it was just ridiculous.",30,,
152,0.97,959.291,961.827,I think I might have made like $4 an hour.,30,,
153,0.97,961.827,970.97,"So today I'm asking for just the basics, like basic minimum wage, and transparency, and fees for all gig workers.",30,,

171,0.97,1026.458,1042.341,"It's easy to see that gig companies want to fool and rule an entire class of people who are, and shall be providing service years from now, while collecting servitude compensations for doing the such for the masses who use these services.",37,,

188,0.97,1111.21,1122.788,"What is the basis for keeping community service officers and other Nonsworn responders in SPD, now that there is a safety communication center.",39,,
189,0.97,1122.788,1128.827,Council should provide zero funding until the move to the new CSC.,39,,
190,0.97,1128.827,1132.364,"To quote from yesterday's post, reductions in the budget can and should occur.",39,,
191,0.97,1132.364,1137.135,The consent decree is not the cause of the ongoing problems with policing in Seattle.,39,,
192,0.97,1137.135,1142.875,"It should not be used to distract from the real problems that exist, in finding solutions to them.",39,,
193,0.97,1142.875,1146.678,The city must do more to address SPD violence.,39,,
194,0.97,1146.678,1153.318,"At the same time, community voices urging changes that could achieve public safety for all should be heeded.",39,,
195,0.97,1153.318,1153.619,Thank you.,39,,
196,0.97,1153.619,1164.062,"Thank you, pen Yvment our next Speaker, Sefhas is noted as not present.",40,,

200,0.97,1177.91,1187.619,I am calling to ask for the city Council to follow through with commitments to transfer all $15 million of salary savings out of the Seattle police Department.,41,,
201,0.97,1187.619,1190.589,The Mayor's new budget request for SPD RAISES many questions.,41,,
202,0.97,1190.589,1192.057,This is one of them.,41,,
203,0.97,1192.057,1206.572,A report by the center for police and equity which was recently published says that black people were subject more than seven times the rate than white people.,41,,
204,0.97,1206.572,1209.408,Native people were stopped nearly nine times as much as white people.,41,,
205,0.97,1209.408,1213.812,And black people were stopped as much as five times more than white people.,41,,
206,0.97,1213.812,1225.891,"Given the data, why should we continue to put more money into SPD, especially to have harmful practices that create true public health and safety.",41,,
207,0.97,1225.891,1235.767,"Seattle is in a period of transferring to community center led approach, keeping salary savings from SPD does not get us closer to true public health and safety.",41,,
208,0.97,1235.767,1239.738,Thank you.,41,,
209,0.97,1239.738,1241.406,Thank you.,42,,

213,0.97,1253.251,1261.994,"I live in D5, where SPD wasted an incredible amount of taxpayer money on suspicion person calls.",43,,
214,0.97,1261.994,1281.313,"Given that only 6.1% of calls for service by SPD are for Felonies, but only 12.9 of officer response time is spent on Felonies and the National Institute for criminal justice reform recommends having a community response to 3/4 of all calls for service.",43,,
215,0.97,1281.313,1295.06,What possible basis could there be to invest budget in increasing SPD sworn officers through hiring bonuses instead of investing in Non-Officer alternatives.,43,,
216,0.97,1295.06,1295.794,If the answer is none?,43,,
217,0.97,1295.794,1304.77,The only fiscally responsible alternative is to invest the entire $15 million in real community safety.,43,,

226,0.97,1327.159,1334.599,"A name on the peace work offered by food services and you still have the same low wage, no benefit jobs we fought against for years.",45,,
227,0.97,1334.599,1344.443,A food delivery driver that I know joked if he ended up living in his car he could tell people he was working from home during the pandemic.,45,,
228,0.97,1344.443,1351.116,What you may not hear is that we need that flexibility to juggle the demands of working two or three low wage jobs.,45,,
229,0.97,1351.116,1366.331,"The truth is my care giving schedule is as flexible as it was 20 years ago, but now it's flexible with affordable Healthcare, paid time off, and Union representation.",45,,
230,0.97,1366.331,1370.602,It took 775 a generation to lift Caregivers out of poverty.,45,,
231,0.97,1370.602,1376.842,We can't waste a generation of gig worker's children to wait for lunch to be delivered.,45,,

242,0.97,1410.075,1416.181,"This proposal from money for SPD was blocked by the city three times, while they listened to research and the community.",49,,
243,0.97,1416.181,1426.625,"This new attempt by SPD, and Mayor Durkan is an insult to the community, which has pushed for community led resources and harm reduction programs.",49,,
244,0.97,1426.625,1429.294,Cops do not stop violence.,49,,
245,0.97,1429.294,1436.301,"Last Thursday, members of SPD's gun violence protection task force used their own guns and murdered a member of our community.",49,,

254,0.97,1464.729,1470.735,I started with Uber eats back in October as extra part time work while working at whole foods.,51,,
255,0.97,1470.735,1476.808,"The wages were actually really good, so I left whole foods to pursue Uber full time.",51,,
256,0.97,1476.808,1483.515,"Unfortunately, in recent months, the wages have dropped so significantly, that I'm now struggling to pay my rent.",51,,
257,0.97,1483.515,1489.221,I'm hoping the city council passes the payoff policy just to give some stability to gig workers like me.,51,,
258,0.97,1489.221,1499.664,"It would be really great to have a minimum wage, or a floor for wages.",51,,

329,0.97,1853.218,1860.358,The work became heavy loads with many things that I had to fit in my car.,66,,
330,0.97,1860.358,1870.168,About two years ago they cut the pay for Instacart workers and I noticed that every day the batches would get less and less.,66,,
331,0.97,1870.168,1877.675,"So I had to work more hours and I couldn't, because I already had another part time job.",66,,
332,0.97,1877.675,1887.051,"And I noticed that sometimes, you know, our load is very high, so we should be paid fair wages for that.",66,,
333,0.97,1887.051,1894.325,And there's more expenses that we have to incur.,66,,
334,0.97,1894.325,1909.741,"I believe we should pass this policy because our skills are something that we should be cherished for, and we deserve that pay.",66,,

342,0.97,1940.505,1949.881,"The fact that you can ask 5,000 of us what we make, or why we make it, not one of us will be able to tell you, because it's nowhere to be found, and that is the problem.",68,,
343,0.97,1949.881,1952.183,There is that lack of support and the decrease in pay.,68,,
344,0.97,1952.183,1957.689,"By the time we get done with an order, we're maybe making four or five dollars an hour.",68,,

371,0.97,2087.919,2090.888,There's more going on than we've covered.,72,,
372,0.97,2090.888,2093.391,That's why a standards board is needed.,72,,
373,0.97,2093.391,2102.767,"The advisory board we need would provide a form for gig workers to provide the Ols in city council on protections, working conditions and other standards.",72,,
374,0.97,2102.767,2108.506,The board would make recommendations regarding both implementation of existing city law as well as proposals for new legislation.,72,,
375,0.97,2108.506,2114.545,"Look, it's no surprise that in the absence of regulation there will be bad actors.",72,,

377,0.97,2125.189,2128.86,At base workers need more of a voice.,72,,
378,0.97,2128.86,2131.462,An advisory board would give them that voice.,72,,

386,0.97,2170.535,2174.605,It just does not make sense to keep medicines outlawed.,74,,
387,0.97,2174.605,2177.642,Especially medicines that have such strong research support.,74,,

399,0.97,2221.118,2223.854,We saw that police do not keep our community safe.,76,,
400,0.97,2223.854,2230.261,So why would you keep pumping money into a broken system that continually failed us?,76,,
401,0.97,2230.261,2233.664,The Mayor's new budget request RAISES many questions.,76,,
402,0.97,2233.664,2233.998,Here's one.,76,,
403,0.97,2233.998,2238.736,The supplemental budget is supposed to be for unforeseen budget items.,76,,
404,0.97,2238.736,2245.376,"The technology demands that SPD is making should all have been planned for, and included in their 2021 budget.",76,,
405,0.97,2245.376,2254.719,"Why would Council fund these Tech demands through a supplemental budget, rather than expecting SPD to work within their planned budget, like every other Department.",76,,
406,0.97,2254.719,2262.36,Seattle is in a crucial period of Transitioning from public safety from SPD to a community centered approach.,76,,
407,0.97,2262.36,2264.528,This is what we need.,76,,
408,0.97,2264.528,2269.433,Keeping salary savings within SPD does not get us closer to true public safety for all.,76,,
409,0.97,2269.433,2269.734,Thank you.,76,,

416,0.97,2298.496,2305.503,One of SPD's requests is to fund an early intervention system.,78,,
417,0.97,2305.503,2311.208,That early intervention system is supposed to catch bad cops before they do bad things.,78,,
418,0.97,2311.208,2315.713,There is no evidence that EIS is actually Affective.,78,,
419,0.97,2315.713,2327.992,"In fact, when SPD catches cops doing bad things, the response is basically to ignore anything OPA has said, and do nothing.",78,,
420,0.97,2327.992,2335.299,So I don't understand this request for additional technology in order to keep not acting on a long standing problem.,78,,
421,0.97,2335.299,2348.346,"Also, I'd like to encourage counsel to pass the door dash and gig worker transparency laws.",78,,

435,0.97,2414.645,2417.481,They already have all of it.,82,,

446,0.97,2464.361,2473.704,What I'm wondering is why is this technology not being moved to the community safety communication center along with 911 dispatch operations?,84,,
447,0.97,2473.704,2496.293,"As we transition public safety from the police Department to I urge you to be spectacle and vigilant of SPD's attempt to fill their coffers with funds for Technologies they do not need for functions which are in the process of being moved out of their Department, which in no way advanced true public safety.",84,,

486,0.97,2741.438,2751.849,The details of the complaint as reported in the South Seattle Emerald reveal that our police accountability system is rotten to the core.,94,,
487,0.97,2751.849,2757.054,The OPA and the Oig merely uphold the policing status quo.,94,,
488,0.97,2757.054,2764.128,The people of Seattle shouldn't have to pay $9 million a year for fake accountability.,94,,
489,0.97,2764.128,2770.334,We could create a genuine accountability system as is happening in other cities.,94,,

500,0.97,2817.781,2830.627,"And two, more importantly, that the Oig, the group that we have in place to monitor the OPA is covering up for the OPA, and is doing so in a way that is designed to evade public review.",96,,

522,0.97,2934.298,2935.265,They do not keep us safe.,100,,
523,0.97,2935.265,2942.472,They can't even do the bare minimum to keep a general community safe.,100,,
524,0.97,2942.472,2953.25,Officers are repeatedly ignoring the mask mandate over the last year.,100,,
525,0.97,2953.25,2955.719,Black lives matter.,100,,
526,0.97,2955.719,2956.086,Thank you.,101,,
527,0.97,2956.086,2964.695,So we're going to go back to a couple folks.,101,,
528,0.97,2964.695,2967.064,"Jason Reeves, you'll still showing as present.",101,,
529,0.97,2967.064,2970.834,Hopefully you can get on with us now.,101,,
530,0.97,2970.834,2974.671,"Hello, can you hear me?",102,,
531,0.97,2974.671,2976.54,"Yes, we can.",103,,
532,0.97,2976.54,2976.873,Awesome.,104,,
533,0.97,2976.873,2977.841,My name is Jason Reeves.,104,,
534,0.97,2977.841,2981.578,I've been a gig worker for five years.,104,,
535,0.97,2981.578,2985.916,I'm here to talk to you about the pay up campaign.,104,,
536,0.97,2985.916,2989.953,We need a pay floor and transparency for youth workers.,104,,
537,0.97,2989.953,2994.291,Without pay standards the gig industry is in a race to the bottom with pay.,104,,
538,0.97,2994.291,3005.302,"Gig workers are driving further for less money every day, if there is not pay standards, companies are figuring out more and more ways to get more and more money out of our pockets.",104,,
539,0.97,3005.302,3021.251,"Paying the most right now, we're making decisions like paying for the most important repairs or forging repairs all together, hoping unexpected repairs won't push us into a financial hole.",104,,
540,0.97,3021.251,3030.193,Transparency will allow drivers to decide which orders are for them to protect themselves and maximize earnings.,104,,
541,0.97,3030.193,3030.56,Simple things.,104,,
542,0.97,3030.56,3030.927,Let's do this.,104,,
543,0.97,3030.927,3032.396,Bang it out.,104,,
544,0.97,3032.396,3033.296,Black lives matter.,104,,
545,0.97,3033.296,3034.931,Thank you so much.,105,,
546,0.97,3034.931,3039.002,"With that, we will conclude our public comment for today.",105,,
547,0.97,3039.002,3042.105,We had three additional speakers but they are still showing as not present.,105,,
548,0.97,3042.105,3045.442,"Thank you, everybody who was able to join us.",105,,
549,0.97,3045.442,3054.151,Will the clerk please read the first agenda item into the record?,105,,
550,0.97,3054.151,3060.857,Agenda item one.,106,,
551,0.97,3060.857,3069.766,"An ordinance relating to parking enforcement, which adopted the 2021 budget, and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",106,,
552,0.97,3069.766,3088.385,I'm going to hold my opening marks and hand it right over to lise Kaye and give us an overview and the steps that brought us to today.,107,,
553,0.97,3088.385,3088.685,Thank you.,107,,
554,0.97,3088.685,3099.529,"Thank you, Madam chair, can you hear me?",108,,
555,0.97,3099.529,3101.364,"Yes, we can.",109,,
556,0.97,3101.364,3103.133,Good.,110,,
557,0.97,3103.133,3105.368,The bill we're talking about is 120-148.,110,,
558,0.97,3105.368,3112.609,This bill would transfer the city's parking enforcement officers from the police Department to the new community Afety and communications center.,110,,
559,0.97,3112.609,3118.148,Section 1 of the bill would transfer the 120 positions.,110,,
560,0.97,3118.148,3129.793,"Second 2 provides a ratify and confirm clause since the effective date would be after the September 1, 2021 deadline.",110,,
561,0.97,3129.793,3136.199,Section 3 makes the bill effective 30 days after the Mayor's approval.,110,,
562,0.97,3136.199,3148.979,"During last fall's budget deliberations, you'll recall that Council passed 136233 which created the community safety and communications center, with two functions to be transferred out of the police department by June 1ST, 2021.",110,,
563,0.97,3148.979,3155.585,"Those functions were the police 911 center, and parking enforcement services.",110,,
564,0.97,3155.585,3171.034,"This ordinance differed from the Mayor's budget, which would have instead transferred to the Seattle Department of transportation, to integrate with that Department's existing right of way nominations.",110,,
565,0.97,3171.034,3174.738,"At that time, they disagreed on where they should be moved.",110,,
566,0.97,3174.738,3184.214,The parking officer's Guild supported a move to the new communications center which they perceived as offering a better path to a large safety rule.,110,,
567,0.97,3184.214,3196.693,The management team supported moving to s DOT as a better fit because of the s DOT current rider way management.,110,,
568,0.97,3196.693,3224.287,"Last May, council passed ordinance 126353 which transferred SPD's 911 call center to the safety and communications center, but delayed a decision on transferring the parking the proviso extension also in May essentially allowed the parking enforcement officers to remain in the police Department through September 1ST of this year.",110,,
569,0.97,3224.287,3233.663,"If counsel does not act by September 1ST, the parking enforcement positions would remain at SPD.",110,,
570,0.97,3233.663,3241.504,"As a result, the executive would need to take additional action to meet the payroll for these positions after September 1ST.",110,,
571,0.97,3241.504,3255.285,"In addition to the bill before you today, the agenda materials also include amendment 1, which would transfer the PEO's to s DOT, instead of to the communications and safety center.",110,,
572,0.97,3255.285,3258.722,"So as shown in my staff memo, the committee has three options today.",110,,
573,0.97,3258.722,3267.53,The first would be to pass Council bill 120148 to transfer the PEO positions to the safety and communications center.,110,,
574,0.97,3267.53,3274.07,Option two would be to pass amendment one to transfer the PEO positions to s DOT.,110,,
575,0.97,3274.07,3281.511,Other option three would be to take no action.,110,,
576,0.97,3281.511,3291.021,"As I've sky described, both would continue framing how the city provides for safety.",110,,
577,0.97,3291.021,3303.133,Passage would also respond to the Council's interest in exploring expanded Dutyies for the PEO's.,110,,
578,0.97,3303.133,3315.211,"Alternately, passage of amendment 1 would transfer to Sdot and align an expanded role with s DOT's operations.",110,,
579,0.97,3315.211,3316.646,"That COMPLETES my report, Madam chair.",110,,
580,0.97,3316.646,3321.851,"Thank you so much, Lisa.",111,,
581,0.97,3321.851,3323.286,That was perfect.,111,,
582,0.97,3323.286,3326.856,So I am going to say a few words.,111,,
583,0.97,3326.856,3332.162,"But before I move into that, just want to see if there are any specific questions.",111,,
584,0.97,3332.162,3335.065,I'm ask for questions afterwards.,111,,
585,0.97,3335.065,3343.773,A little bit of a finer point on what I hope we can accomplish here today.,111,,
586,0.97,3343.773,3344.074,Excuse me.,111,,
587,0.97,3344.074,3374.871,"If you recall, back in May when we were considering moving the PEO's into the community safety and communications center there was not alignment on the part of the Council that that is the action we should take, despite the fact that, in the budget process, we had unanimously passed an ordinance that had crossed our intent to do so.",111,,
588,0.97,3374.871,3380.71,So I don't want to Replicate what happened back in May.,111,,
589,0.97,3380.71,3399.629,"In May, we were really hoping to gather additional information, see if the frontline PEO's and the supervisors are being represented by Spiog, the parking enforcement officers Guild, and the supervisors being represented by protect.",111,,
590,0.97,3399.629,3437.567,"We were really hoping they could come together and work on an agreement on which Department could agree that the unit would move to the bill before us has a flexible title in case we decide today to not move forward with a transfer the Csdc as originally proposed, and I can report back to folks that there have been some limited conversations between Spiog and Protec.",111,,
591,0.97,3437.567,3466.663,"Though I understand that both units, the unit that represents the frontline PEO's and the unit that represents the supervisors protect that there is still not agreement, and they are maintaining their current positions on the issues.",111,,
592,0.97,3466.663,3486.316,"And so, you know, the fact that we need to take some sort of an action, before September, and that we have a single council meeting, full council meeting in order to move this legislation forward.",111,,
593,0.97,3486.316,3508.571,"I have proposed amendment one, which instead moves the unit to Sdot as a position of Tech and the position of Mayor and Sdot and the position of, I believe, a majority at the Council at this point, despite the position that was taken last fall.",111,,
594,0.97,3508.571,3523.253,So I am prepared to move amendment one to move the unit to Sdot in order to avoid a do not pass recommendation from this committee going to full Council on Monday.,111,,
595,0.97,3523.253,3535.498,"So with that, I just want to hear from folks whether or not that is a acceptable approach forward.",111,,
596,0.97,3535.498,3543.206,"And just, we'll take a pause here and see if I see any raised hands.",111,,
597,0.97,3543.206,3548.611,Morales.,111,,
598,0.97,3548.611,3549.145,Seeing you're off camera.,111,,
599,0.97,3549.145,3559.088,"Yeah, so I'm wondering if we can talk a little about what the options are then.",112,,
600,0.97,3559.088,3588.952,"My understanding is that the rank and file really is interested in expansion of their responsibilities and eager to, you know, be able to provide more community based security and response, and so, if they are going to Sdot, what is the way forward for them to be able to have the kind of expansion and responsibilities that they're seeking?",112,,
601,0.97,3588.952,3605.101,"I will say a couple words, but I think lise Kaye may have some additional thoughts here from what Sdot has told us.",113,,
602,0.97,3605.101,3616.679,But there are opportunities within Sdot to take on more of a street management right of way set of responsibilities.,113,,
603,0.97,3616.679,3636.399,Very similar to the conversation that we've been having here on the council about having more PEO's take on some of the traffic management responsibilities that Seattle police Department sworn officers take on as part of overtime and staffing events.,113,,
604,0.97,3636.399,3660.556,"That kind of expansion would still absolutely be possible if they were transferred to Sdot, precisely because so many things that the Poe's do, and could do in the future, specifically relate to right of way management.",113,,
605,0.97,3660.556,3660.89,Lise?,114,,
606,0.97,3660.89,3684.28,"Yes, and I don't have too much to add to your great explanation other than the materials that I believe the Council has advocated for moving the group to Sdot have summarized the issues that Councilmember Herbold mentioned that Sdot is interested in providing growth materials for the PEO's.",115,,
607,0.97,3684.28,3696.659,I would note that the expansion of PEO duties is subject to bartering.,115,,
608,0.97,3696.659,3706.836,"It's a complex issue, but Sdot has indicated an interest in trying to help people find those career opportunities.",115,,
609,0.97,3706.836,3708.471,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez.",116,,
610,0.97,3708.471,3713.376,"Hi, sorry I'm off camera, but I'm at home with a sick toddler.",117,,
611,0.97,3713.376,3716.813,I just want to signal my support.,117,,
612,0.97,3716.813,3740.603,"For someone, I was one of the committee members here who signaled my interest in wanting to see this go to Sdot, and I think the assurances of knowing that the scope and functions, the body of work, if you will, can be modified in a way that is still consistent with the underlying intent of why we were wanting to move parking enforcement out of SPD in the first place is still present.",117,,
613,0.97,3740.603,3748.444,And I think that for me is really important.,117,,
614,0.97,3748.444,3755.485,"And so I'm prepared to support amendment one if there is a motion, which I hope there will be.",117,,
615,0.97,3755.485,3763.826,I would be happy to support that particular position.,117,,
616,0.97,3763.826,3765.695,Thank you.,118,,
617,0.97,3765.695,3775.071,"Any other feedback from committee members watching both the virtual hand raising, and the real hand raising.",118,,
618,0.97,3775.071,3775.571,Councilmember Pedersen.,118,,
619,0.97,3775.571,3780.176,I did not even realize you were with us.,118,,
620,0.97,3780.176,3780.443,Welcome.,118,,
621,0.97,3780.443,3781.144,"Thank you, chair Herbold.",119,,
622,0.97,3781.144,3798.027,"I just wanted to thank you for putting forward this amendment, and I understand, even though I'm an alternate on the committee, I think I'm able to vote now, because there is one absence on the committee today.",119,,
623,0.97,3798.027,3804.333,I just wanted to join in your support for an amendment.,119,,
624,0.97,3804.333,3812.408,My apologies for not recognizing that you had joined us earlier.,120,,
625,0.97,3812.408,3812.608,Okay.,120,,
626,0.97,3812.608,3819.348,"Well not seeing any other hands raised, no other people coming on camera.",120,,
627,0.97,3819.348,3829.926,So I'm going to first work to get the bill before the committee.,120,,
628,0.97,3829.926,3830.86,I move 120148.,120,,
629,0.97,3830.86,3831.994,Is there a second?,120,,
630,0.97,3831.994,3832.595,Second.,121,,
631,0.97,3832.595,3834.931,Thank you.,122,,
632,0.97,3834.931,3864.527,"Again, in the interest of not repeating the effort from last May and risking sending a piece of legislation from this committee with a do not pass recommendation, which was the case last May, where we had two Councilmembers in favor to abstaining, and one opposed.",122,,
633,0.97,3864.527,3876.172,"Thankfully, when we sent that bill to full Council, we instead extended the proviso to give us this additional time.",122,,
634,0.97,3876.172,3883.412,"But again, we're pushing to move this forward, and ensure that they get paid in September.",122,,
635,0.97,3883.412,3886.482,I move amendment one as listed on the agenda.,122,,
636,0.97,3886.482,3887.717,Is there a second?,122,,
637,0.97,3887.717,3888.284,Second.,123,,
638,0.97,3888.284,3888.651,Thank you.,124,,
639,0.97,3888.651,3896.125,Is there any additional discussion on the amendment?,124,,
640,0.97,3896.125,3898.561,Okay.,124,,
641,0.97,3898.561,3907.57,"Seeingno additional discussion, will the clerk please call the roll?",124,,
642,0.97,3907.57,3910.039,Council President Gonzalez.,125,,

663,0.97,3955.952,3958.921,Will the clerk please read in the next item.,145,,
664,0.97,3958.921,3966.195,"Item number 2, community safety capacity building Rpf presentation.",146,,
665,0.97,3966.195,3976.405,Now we're going to have a presentation from the human services Department on building.,147,,
666,0.97,3976.405,3983.98,I'm sure my fellow committee members will remember the $12 million investment for the interested public.,147,,
667,0.97,3983.98,3998.661,"So intended these funds to build capacity, and community safety organizations that provide alternatives to policing, and the criminal system for both violent, and non-violent crime.",147,,
668,0.97,3998.661,4205.267,"Council first provided $12 million in funding for last summer's rebalancing process, and increased it 12 million in 2021 when the work did not occur and the funding was not division director for the Thrivent communities.",147,,
669,0.97,4205.267,4206.402,"Good morning, Natalie Thompson.",148,,
670,0.97,4206.402,4210.506,So the three of us are from the human services Department.,149,,
671,0.97,4210.506,4227.79,"We represent the Department as well as various divisions internally, and we're just as Councilmember Herbold said, so happy to be here, so we can follow up and really discuss, provide an overview again of the process.",149,,
672,0.97,4227.79,4234.363,But making sure that we are able to share what the results are as well.,149,,
673,0.97,4234.363,4251.447,"And so on the next slide, which is the overview, we will review the request for proposal . Just Recap that for folks here.",149,,
674,0.97,4251.447,4258.654,"Part of Rfp is discussing the rating process itself, so you understand how we got here.",149,,
675,0.97,4258.654,4266.228,We will discuss the organizations that applied as well as the organizations that we have awarded.,149,,
676,0.97,4266.228,4277.906,"And we will discuss a little bit more about the summary of the Awardees themselves, and time permitting have a question and answer.",149,,
677,0.97,4277.906,4284.38,"And as always, we'll be happy to follow up with anything we're unto respond to today.",149,,
678,0.97,4284.38,4311.774,"The reason why we're showing up as the three of us is because we're also pleased to introduce REX Brown, who is the new division director over at the safe and thriving communities division, and just as a reminder we are consolidating all of our safety related investments under REX's leadership because for many different reasons, but in particular, we want to make sure there's alignment.",149,,
679,0.97,4311.774,4315.611,We have the dedicated leadership to really focus on this body of work.,149,,
680,0.97,4315.611,4334.697,"Also, this is a good opportunity for us to work more closely with our Mayor's office on domestic violence and sexual assault with our community safety work and our direct services that we're providing for our victim advocates and our volunteers all under one shop.",149,,
681,0.97,4334.697,4339.902,We have been to committee multiple times to discuss those various components.,149,,
682,0.97,4339.902,4343.305,"So that said, REX is new, so we're happy to introduce him.",149,,
683,0.97,4343.305,4355.584,"But Natalie is not as new, and has been carrying the work while we've been standing up, not only the division, but making sure we can get these investments out to the community, in a timely manner.",149,,
684,0.97,4355.584,4360.322,"So together, we're going to team to get you where we're at, and where we're going to be.",149,,
685,0.97,4360.322,4370.733,A quick NOTE before I hand it over to Natalie is that the Rfp has concluded we have sent out the announcements to the applicants.,149,,
686,0.97,4370.733,4383.712,"So Natalie's going to do a deeper dive, but you should know that we are actively currently negotiating contracts because we are on a Timeline and people want to start their work as soon as possible.",149,,
687,0.97,4383.712,4394.289,"So with that, I'm going to hand it over to Natalie, who will review the Rfp itself.",149,,
688,0.97,4394.289,4394.89,"Thank you, Tanya.",150,,
689,0.97,4394.89,4402.431,So there was tremendous interest in this request for proposal process from the community.,150,,
690,0.97,4402.431,4422.251,"As a reminder, we did solicit proposals from community led groups working to end violence, and to Reimagine safety in black, indigenous, and people of Color-Led communities with a specific focus on black, indigenous, Latin X, Pacific Islander, and immigrant and refugee communities.",150,,
691,0.97,4422.251,4433.529,"Of course, as the Council chair mentioned, the purpose of this funding was to prepare the capacity of groups working toward the community led solutions to increased safety.",150,,
692,0.97,4433.529,4441.436,"So as a reminder, Hsd conducted 36 listening circles from January through February of 2021.",150,,
693,0.97,4441.436,4455.35,"The sessions were small group conversations, comprised of community members with lift experience, with harm from the criminal legal system and gender based violence as well as staff.",150,,
694,0.97,4455.35,4458.887,Community based organizations doing community safety work.,150,,
695,0.97,4458.887,4461.623,Many of whom had lived experiences themselves.,150,,
696,0.97,4461.623,4471.767,"Each session averaged about one hour, but more time was allotted if community members had more to share, which many did.",150,,
697,0.97,4471.767,4482.044,The key themes from those community Engain sessions which do inform the Rfp were that the definition of community safety must be Holistic and inclusive.,150,,
698,0.97,4482.044,4509.972,"There's an aspect to community safety, which involves healing from systems of oppression like criminal system, as well as feelings of hope and Self- determination, that must also be woven into the guidelines and application, and that there must be Community-Led, and community centered solutions to safety.",150,,
699,0.97,4509.972,4510.372,So next slide.,150,,
700,0.97,4510.372,4523.819,"So again, as a reminder, the purpose was to build capacity for community led solutions to end violence and increase safety and the guidelines were to fund projects that were community led.",150,,
701,0.97,4523.819,4555.317,"We did decide again, based on community engagements that the organizations themselves would define the safety issue that Úthey wanted to address, how thy measured success, in order it's solution and how they described a specific methodology, we thought that we wanted the organizations themselves to address and to mention how they would measure success.",150,,
702,0.97,4555.317,4573.569,"So the Rfp did focus on capacity building to scale up, increased services with existing organizations or seed new organizations for exploring new strategies.",150,,
703,0.97,4573.569,4574.436,Next slide.,150,,
704,0.97,4574.436,4579.508,"So just quickly, the Rfp was released on March 1ST.",150,,
705,0.97,4579.508,4584.079,Written applications were due on April 9. interviews were held in April and May.,150,,
706,0.97,4584.079,4590.986,"There was a panel of 22 raiders that reviewed, and recommended proposals for funding.",150,,
707,0.97,4590.986,4599.494,I'll speak a little about the composition of the review Committee in a bit.,150,,
708,0.97,4599.494,4607.603,"So as the Council chair also mentioned, there was $12 million for this investment.",150,,
709,0.97,4607.603,4611.006,$10.4Million went directly to grants.,150,,
710,0.97,4611.006,4640.636,"$1.6Million went to administrative costs like translation, application, technical assistance, and will go toward network convening and evaluation, because the vision is to build a community of providers doing the work and together, and Collaboratively develop community based Indicaters for safety.",150,,
711,0.97,4640.636,4640.969,Next slide.,150,,
712,0.97,4640.969,4643.238,The rating committee was diverse.,150,,
713,0.97,4643.238,4648.844,"They were diverse in age, gender, Ethnicity, many had lived experience.",150,,
714,0.97,4648.844,4675.837,"They had affiliations like with the black prisoners caucus, friends of youth, institutional racism collaborative, Asian Pacific Islander, community leadership foundation, the Naacp, the Pierce County trafficking, sexual exploitation initiative, queer the land, just to name a few.",150,,
715,0.97,4675.837,4683.311,"The interviews were conducted in Realtime, rather than being recorded, so that no public record would be created.",150,,
716,0.97,4683.311,4686.348,And no Unintentional harm as well.,150,,
717,0.97,4686.348,4695.357,"So this ended up being very labor intensive, but every applicant was able to participate as was every raider.",150,,
718,0.97,4695.357,4700.128,So the raiding committee participated in Anti-Bias training.,150,,
719,0.97,4700.128,4711.306,"Agreed to a group Covenant for participation, discussion and accountability, and signed confidentiality, and conflict of interest statements.",150,,
720,0.97,4711.306,4718.847,"So the raiders reviewed all written applications, and scored all interviews.",150,,
721,0.97,4718.847,4721.817,"So REX, I think this is you.",150,,
722,0.97,4721.817,4723.318,"Thank you, Natalie.",151,,
723,0.97,4723.318,4723.685,Next slide.,151,,
724,0.97,4723.685,4725.187,Thank you so much.,151,,
725,0.97,4725.187,4731.026,So there are a total of 78 applications.,151,,
726,0.97,4731.026,4741.77,"Five were not rated for various reasons, including withdrawal and Ineligibility.",151,,
727,0.97,4741.77,4746.641,33 applicants were recommended for funding.,151,,
728,0.97,4746.641,4750.979,"And like the Raters themselves, a very broad group.",151,,
729,0.97,4750.979,4755.617,Awardees will provide an array of strategies and services.,151,,
730,0.97,4755.617,4769.798,"In general, these services include activating neighborhood based strategies to reduce crime rates at hot spots.",151,,
731,0.97,4769.798,4771.6,Next slide.,151,,
732,0.97,4771.6,4775.537,"Deescalation, and response to shots fired.",151,,
733,0.97,4775.537,4776.338,"Reentry services, case management.",151,,
734,0.97,4776.338,4780.242,Next slide please.,151,,
735,0.97,4780.242,4784.646,"Community awareness about Disproportionalty, and criminal legal services.",151,,
736,0.97,4784.646,4790.619,Family support to prevent youth from entering the criminal legal system in the first place.,151,,
737,0.97,4790.619,4797.559,Supports to address family and gender based violence.,151,,
738,0.97,4797.559,4798.26,Next slide.,151,,
739,0.97,4798.26,4817.312,"About half of the Awardees, first time awards, which Aligns with the design and interest of an intent of the Rfp to promote community led solutions, allowing community members and agencies to define safety investments.",151,,
740,0.97,4817.312,4822.551,You can see the board representation in these Awardees.,151,,
741,0.97,4822.551,4823.051,Next slide.,151,,
742,0.97,4823.051,4832.16,"I'll turn it back over to you, Tanya.",151,,
743,0.97,4832.16,4832.694,"Yeah, sorry.",152,,
744,0.97,4832.694,4836.031,"So we gave some, I think, just some overview.",152,,
745,0.97,4836.031,4840.135,The real interest I think for a lot of folks is who was awarded again?,152,,
746,0.97,4840.135,4852.38,"You saw in the slide, just a brief name in a memo that we have also submitted to Committee and Councilmember Herbold's offices, that there's a little bit more of a description there.",152,,
747,0.97,4852.38,4858.72,But it's really a lot to go over in a brief 30 minute presentation.,152,,
748,0.97,4858.72,4863.458,We are really eager to stand up these organizations.,152,,
749,0.97,4863.458,4883.845,"So then that way, we can report back on some more, you know, information as well as potentially also share what it is that they're doing, and Revisit a committee with the organization, so we can continue to be true to our approach, which is having this community led.",152,,
750,0.97,4883.845,4890.385,So for now we at least wanted to circle back and share with you what the results are.,152,,
751,0.97,4890.385,4900.762,"With that, we're happy to go ahead and field any questions that you might have.",152,,
752,0.97,4900.762,4905.5,"Chair Herbold, you're on mute.",152,,
753,0.97,4905.5,4906.001,Thank you so much.,153,,
754,0.97,4906.001,4914.843,"I appreciate that overview, and appreciate Y'all being here with us today.",153,,
755,0.97,4914.843,4915.677,"Great to meet you, REX.",153,,
756,0.97,4915.677,4918.88,I look forward to working with you more over the next year.,153,,
757,0.97,4918.88,4921.616,"Councilmember Morales, I see your hand is raised.",153,,
758,0.97,4921.616,4922.217,Thank you.,154,,
759,0.97,4922.217,4923.318,I don't have any questions.,154,,
760,0.97,4923.318,4941.403,"I just want to thank all of you for the presentation, for the work you're doing this is, in my mind, a really exciting first step for the city, to be moving away from a gun and badge response to community safety.",154,,
761,0.97,4941.403,4946.908,So I think this is really important way for us to start transforming that system.,154,,
762,0.97,4946.908,4965.427,"That said, this is one time funding, and I'm really interested in moving us toward longer term commitments that would allow for more sustainable programming, and to really think about how these community groups can achieve the kind of outcomes that we're asking for them.",154,,
763,0.97,4965.427,4966.428,That all takes time.,154,,
764,0.97,4966.428,4969.564,It takes time to build the capacity.,154,,
765,0.97,4969.564,4976.638,"It takes time to implement, and really start to have the outcomes that we're looking for.",154,,
766,0.97,4976.638,4979.174,So just want to put that marker out there.,154,,
767,0.97,4979.174,4983.878,I'm really hopping that we can start thinking about more sustainable programming for them.,154,,
768,0.97,4983.878,4996.825,"Then the other thing I just want to say is that, you know, we really made sure that the process that you went through for this contracting and for the Rfp really included the technical assistance.",154,,
769,0.97,4996.825,5010.672,I think that's a really critical piece of the work that as a city we need to do to make sure that our organizations that are rooted in communities of color have the kind of assistance they need to develop those proposals.,154,,
770,0.97,5010.672,5020.815,I think the fact that we had over 70 applicants is a really good Indicater of the effectiveness of that technical assistance.,154,,
771,0.97,5020.815,5049.177,"But if we're going to be a racially justice city that believes in equal opportunity for our communities of color to participate in, and engage, then we really need to be Prioritizing that kind of early Engainment, early assistance, so that we aren't Overtaxing and expecting folks to compete for limited resources without any sort of assistance to help them get that.",154,,
772,0.97,5049.177,5075.403,"I really appreciate the work that you're doing, and just want to commend you on the technical assistance that you offered, and look forward to having more discussion with you, about how we create a longer term financial commitment for this work that we know is really critical in order for us to change the Ecosystem.",154,,
773,0.97,5075.403,5076.404,Thank you.,154,,
774,0.97,5076.404,5078.773,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,155,,
775,0.97,5078.773,5080.775,"If there's any response, it's fine.",155,,
776,0.97,5080.775,5086.948,"And if not, just opening it up to other questions or comments.",155,,
777,0.97,5086.948,5091.586,I have a couple questions.,155,,
778,0.97,5091.586,5099.127,We'll move onto questions associated.,155,,
779,0.97,5099.127,5121.182,"I want to just echo Councilmember Morales's points, I really appreciate the efforts for practices in the Rfp process itself, including technical assistance during the application process, and providing for the Raters.",155,,
780,0.97,5121.182,5133.394,I am really interested in the Cohort convening that is part of the expectation for funded organizations moving forward.,155,,
781,0.97,5133.394,5142.504,I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the purpose and plans for that Cohort convening.,155,,
782,0.97,5142.504,5165.66,I also want to talk a little bit about the fact that there's a goal for contracting black or indigenous led teams to work with the Cohort of Awardees during the year in order to develop Metrics to understand the project's impacts on community safety.,155,,
783,0.97,5165.66,5170.098,I think that there is a lot of really exciting potential there.,155,,
784,0.97,5170.098,5187.882,"And I want to just link into that development of Metrics and evaluation work that the city auditor had previously done, a significant amount of work around similar programs to the ones that we are funding now.",155,,
785,0.97,5187.882,5197.859,"I did ask them to provide, produce a brief report based on those 2015 recommendations.",155,,
786,0.97,5197.859,5215.076,"And I'm hoping that that work from the city auditor can help support the community based organizations that have received community safety awards, and the external team evaluation of that effort.",155,,
787,0.97,5215.076,5229.624,And I'm hoping that we can use this regular Cohort convening to include making some movement on some of those outstanding city auditor recommendations.,155,,
788,0.97,5229.624,5233.394,So that's one question I have.,155,,
789,0.97,5233.394,5249.544,The other question I have is we heard yesterday that there has been an additional seven proposals partially funded using resources outside of the safety Rfp.,155,,
790,0.97,5249.544,5259.821,I was wondering if you could briefly provide a little more information about the proposals and the outside funding sources that were used.,155,,
791,0.97,5259.821,5270.999,I'm interested in knowing whether or not those seven organizations will also be participating in the Cohort and evaluation associated with the Rfp Awardees.,155,,
792,0.97,5270.999,5271.299,Thank you.,155,,
793,0.97,5271.299,5271.599,Great.,156,,
794,0.97,5271.599,5283.144,"Given that REX is pretty new, and that question, the first question that you have has multiple parts over multiple years, I'll field that one.",156,,
795,0.97,5283.144,5285.713,"So REX, you can thank me later.",156,,
796,0.97,5285.713,5286.914,Feel free to Chime in.,156,,
797,0.97,5286.914,5295.857,"So in our safety portfolio, we do have now this group of 33 contracted providers.",156,,
798,0.97,5295.857,5304.799,But we also have millions of dollars worth of safety investments that were issued through a previous 2019 community safety Rfp as well.,156,,
799,0.97,5304.799,5314.776,"And as you're aware, the city is making an investment in public health, Seattle King County's regional Peacekeeper collective.",156,,
800,0.97,5314.776,5327.355,"So we've got a lot of activity, and to add to that, we are taking on PDA's lead contract, which is a multimillion dollar investment too.",156,,
801,0.97,5327.355,5343.638,"So REX has a wonderful, Rebust portfolio, which means that we are thinking about not just this investment in terms of having Convenings and a Cohort.",156,,
802,0.97,5343.638,5345.673,How to bring all of our providers together.,156,,
803,0.97,5345.673,5350.845,"We want to make sure we're providing technical assistance to skill up, to build relationships.",156,,
804,0.97,5350.845,5375.87,"We are also, as you had mentioned, and city auditor's office has reached out to us, we're going to Reengage in making some Improvenments where applicable, because as somebody had mentioned previously, we used to have different model called the Seattle violence prevention initiative.",156,,
805,0.97,5375.87,5381.676,Some of that is no longer relevant because that was reinvested.,156,,
806,0.97,5381.676,5382.243,We'll be looking at that.,156,,
807,0.97,5382.243,5389.117,"In that $12 million budget that we had, and some of that investment is set aside, we do have money set aside for evaluation.",156,,
808,0.97,5389.117,5403.297,"Part of that, we also imagine is a part of that ongoing technical assistance, because we have so many new providers too, so we want to make sure that the technical assistance continues.",156,,
809,0.97,5403.297,5404.465,It's a top priority.,156,,
810,0.97,5404.465,5405.867,We're still hiring staff.,156,,
811,0.97,5405.867,5412.807,"Once we get everybody aligned, and we are functioning at full capacity, that is something now we're going to move towards.",156,,
812,0.97,5412.807,5419.347,So we're going to address that 100%.,156,,
813,0.97,5419.347,5430.525,"As far as the one time ads, or investments rather, outside of this Rfp, Natalie has a little bit more information on those fund sources.",156,,
814,0.97,5430.525,5450.578,"I will mention, though, that when we read these proposals, even though they were scored highly by the community Raters, when we looked at the performance Metrics that they were proposing, it really did fall more along the prevention, which is fantastic.",156,,
815,0.97,5450.578,5450.912,It's needed.,156,,
816,0.97,5450.912,5468.196,"But what we're trying to really focus in on with this investment is increasing safety to reduce violence in a way that we can measure in the near future, and where there were some highly scored proposals that we're really talking about the creating conditions of Well- being.",156,,
817,0.97,5468.196,5471.632,"That really seemed to suit some other fund sources, which Natalie can explain.",156,,
818,0.97,5471.632,5477.405,That's the beautiful thing about the human services Department.,156,,
819,0.97,5477.405,5479.273,It is its continuum.,156,,
820,0.97,5479.273,5485.746,"We have our youth empowerment initiative, and now we have the safe communities initiative that can get laser focused.",156,,
821,0.97,5485.746,5498.059,"That's some of the internal decision making that we made, but it's not a precedent that we want to start with every Rfp process, because we don't typically have funds that we can allocate towards that.",156,,
822,0.97,5498.059,5503.064,"So Natalie, if you wouldn't mind giving a little bit more information.",156,,
823,0.97,5503.064,5503.431,Absolutely.,157,,
824,0.97,5503.431,5506.968,"That was such a great context setting, Tanya.",157,,
825,0.97,5506.968,5522.116,"So those 7 proposals, precisely as Tanya said were really recommended by Raters as proposals that were worthy of receiving some level of funding.",157,,
826,0.97,5522.116,5526.888,But that didn't have the direct focus of Community-Led solutions to safety.,157,,
827,0.97,5526.888,5533.327,So what we did is we identified one time only funding.,157,,
828,0.97,5533.327,5550.745,"Mostly general fund funding, as well as sweetened beverage tax funding, and a small amount of human services Fund, so that we could Fund, for example, some of the food justice initiatives with sweetened beverage tax funding.",157,,
829,0.97,5550.745,5554.916,So we took the rate of recommendation there.,157,,
830,0.97,5554.916,5566.26,They will be receiving one time partial funding.,157,,
831,0.97,5566.26,5574.435,"And to your question about it if they are a part, that will be determined.",157,,
832,0.97,5574.435,5585.446,"We'll circle them back in, but the reason why we split it is it wasn't articulated, so it's unlikely.",158,,
833,0.97,5585.446,5586.847,That's super helpful to understand.,159,,
834,0.97,5586.847,5597.358,"And it sounds like, because the focus for these investments is different, are you saying that they are not going to be part of the safe and thriving division?",159,,
835,0.97,5597.358,5604.799,It would be youth and family empowerment.,160,,
836,0.97,5604.799,5607.001,That's correct.,160,,
837,0.97,5607.001,5608.302,That makes good sense.,161,,
838,0.97,5608.302,5608.603,Thank you.,161,,
839,0.97,5608.603,5614.041,Pausing to see if other Councilmembers have questions.,161,,
840,0.97,5614.041,5615.977,I have one more if not.,161,,
841,0.97,5615.977,5616.177,Okay.,161,,
842,0.97,5616.177,5637.631,"My last question is just related to the fact that one of the questions asked on the Rfp was whether the proposal submitted by the providers would be an alternate to police response, and whether the proposal would be a Co-Response to a police function?",161,,
843,0.97,5637.631,5648.275,"I understand that of the successful applicants four indicated that they would be an alternate to police, and six indicated they would be a Co- response.",161,,
844,0.97,5648.275,5667.194,"I'm wondering if you could go a little bit deeper into those funded projects, and whether or not your staff did an independent analysis of whether a proposal might be considered an alternative, or Co-Response, or did you rely on the applicants Self-Assessments?",161,,
845,0.97,5667.194,5679.874,"Well, I can answer the latter part first, which is it was reliant on the applicant to Self-Identify.",162,,
846,0.97,5679.874,5683.611,"But Natalie and REX, are we prepared to go a little bit deeper?",162,,
847,0.97,5683.611,5689.517,I would like to follow that in a separate discussion.,163,,
848,0.97,5689.517,5697.324,"I think given the constraints of time and the detail needed to fully articulate it, it would be better.",163,,
849,0.97,5697.324,5706.033,"I would feel more comfortable if we could wait and have that conversation with you, Councilmember her bolt.",163,,
850,0.97,5706.033,5713.741,So we can follow up with more information.,164,,
851,0.97,5713.741,5724.285,"The Rfp itself, and the committee also has definitions of what does it mean to provide an alternative, or a Co- response.",164,,
852,0.97,5724.285,5730.725,"I think for that, on the cover sheet, we're relying on Self- reporting.",164,,
853,0.97,5730.725,5741.735,"And so I will say that we couldn't then do a deep analysis, given that it wasn't defined, and they weren't explicitly being rated for that.",164,,
854,0.97,5741.735,5745.906,It was more of trying to understand where they saw themselves in that conversation.,164,,
855,0.97,5745.906,5751.879,But we will be happy to provide for information about who those self defined folks were.,164,,
856,0.97,5751.879,5755.416,And what they propose to do.,165,,
857,0.97,5755.416,5766.127,Where I think keenly interested in that as part of this conversation around alternate community safety responses.,166,,
858,0.97,5766.127,5769.897,And how the city can support them.,166,,
859,0.97,5769.897,5773.834,Thank you so much.,166,,
860,0.97,5773.834,5774.034,Okay.,166,,
861,0.97,5774.034,5776.77,I'm not seeing any other questions here.,166,,
862,0.97,5776.77,5787.281,"I just want to close it out by, you know, again, appreciating the work that you're doing.",166,,
863,0.97,5787.281,5810.437,"You know, back in February the National Commission on Covid-19 and criminal justice membership including our own Seattle police chief Adrian Diaz as a national Commission recommended urgent action to address pauses of threats to safety.",166,,
864,0.97,5810.437,5815.075,"Covid pandemic concerns about policing, and funding Anti- violence strategies.",166,,
865,0.97,5815.075,5823.417,"Back in February, the Commission reported increased violent, and property offense rates for 39 cities, including Seattle.",166,,
866,0.97,5823.417,5828.923,"And the report noted that crime is a cause for alarm, not panic.",166,,
867,0.97,5828.923,5853.914,"And the Commission reports that the pandemic has placed individuals under physical, mental, emotional, and financial stress in strained institutions, respond to violent officials, including community based groups that engage and depend heavily on Proactive outreach to At-Risk people and places.",166,,
868,0.97,5853.914,5857.551,So this came out in February.,166,,
869,0.97,5857.551,5862.056,"We're still seeing the alarming increases in violent, and property offense rates.",166,,
870,0.97,5862.056,5874.501,But I just want to flag that this Council has been prepared to address this with this exactly this kind of strategy.,166,,
871,0.97,5874.501,5875.536,Since August of last year.,166,,
872,0.97,5875.536,5880.474,"So I just bring that up to say, we do have a plan.",166,,
873,0.97,5880.474,5888.449,It's a plan that Aligns with national recommendations.,166,,
874,0.97,5888.449,5902.329,"Public criminal justice related commissions, and commissions that recognize that Covid-19 has contributed to increase in violence in our community.",166,,
875,0.97,5902.329,5922.016,"So really, really pleased that this work is coming to bear, and really appreciative to the folks who are out there on the streets making this work, and making our community safer by working together and caring for one another.",166,,
876,0.97,5922.016,5927.488,So really I want to thank you again.,166,,
877,0.97,5927.488,5929.49,And with that.,166,,
878,0.97,5929.49,5933.394,We'll move onto the final item on our agenda.,166,,
879,0.97,5933.394,5937.197,The clerk please read the item into the agenda.,166,,
880,0.97,5937.197,5941.135,Agenda item number 3.,167,,
881,0.97,5941.135,5945.639,Seattle police Department quarterly Finance and staffing report.,167,,
882,0.97,5945.639,5946.173,Briefing and discussion.,167,,
883,0.97,5946.173,5946.84,"Thank you, Alex.",168,,
884,0.97,5946.84,5952.313,I'm going to quickly hand this over to central staff.,168,,
885,0.97,5952.313,5953.847,A couple Wordes.,168,,
886,0.97,5953.847,5963.057,This is the second update from Council staff in 2021.,168,,
887,0.97,5963.057,5967.127,The Council requested these updates as part of our budget process last year.,168,,
888,0.97,5967.127,5973.0,Central staff is presenting them on a quarterly basis.,168,,
889,0.97,5973.0,5979.54,Greg Doss has done a tremendous opt of work to compile this.,168,,
890,0.97,5979.54,5983.711,I understand he's received a lot of assistance from the Seattle police Department.,168,,
891,0.97,5983.711,5986.747,We will also be joined by Dr.,168,,
892,0.97,5986.747,5997.524,"Christopher Fisher and Angela Socci of the Seattle police Department as part of this presentation, and I really thank you for helping Greg with this.",168,,
893,0.97,5997.524,6006.867,"And with that, let's just do a quick round of introductions.",168,,
894,0.97,6006.867,6007.134,Sure.,169,,
895,0.97,6007.134,6007.434,Greg Doss.,169,,
896,0.97,6007.434,6011.505,Council central staff.,169,,
897,0.97,6011.505,6016.977,"Angela Socci, SPD budget director.",170,,
898,0.97,6016.977,6020.614,"Chris Fisher, executive director of initiatives at SPD.",171,,
899,0.97,6020.614,6021.448,Thank you so much.,172,,
900,0.97,6021.448,6025.119,"Greg, do you want to lead us?",172,,
901,0.97,6025.119,6032.893,"Thank you, Madam chair, and thank you for thanking SPD staff for their work.",173,,
902,0.97,6032.893,6035.863,I really just am putting together the information they give me.,173,,
903,0.97,6035.863,6043.67,It is so helpful to have them work with me on the data and put together the reports.,173,,
904,0.97,6043.67,6048.609,"And so, I can't thank them enough and it's great to work with them too.",173,,
905,0.97,6048.609,6052.513,"Here with Angela Socci, the budget director, and Dr. Chris Fisher.",173,,
906,0.97,6052.513,6056.917,We'll be going over the January to June data.,173,,
907,0.97,6056.917,6058.452,Quite a bit of it.,173,,
908,0.97,6058.452,6073.634,And so I'm going to go ahead and share my screen for the presentation.,173,,
909,0.97,6073.634,6079.973,And one second here.,173,,
910,0.97,6079.973,6080.474,Can you all see this?,173,,
911,0.97,6080.474,6085.212,Is it big enough?,173,,
912,0.97,6085.212,6087.681,"Okay, seeing nodding.",173,,
913,0.97,6087.681,6088.015,All right.,173,,
914,0.97,6088.015,6092.786,"So I'm going to start out with, actually, it might be a bit too big.",173,,
915,0.97,6092.786,6099.46,I'm going to start out with the statements of legislative intent covered by this particular report.,173,,
916,0.97,6099.46,6102.996,We've got an awful lot that goes into this report.,173,,
917,0.97,6102.996,6104.698,Four different statements of legislative intent.,173,,
918,0.97,6104.698,6118.545,"The first one is a financial reporting slide, that covers really everything that SPD does financially.",173,,
919,0.97,6118.545,6122.082,It focuses in on financial reporting categorical reporting.,173,,
920,0.97,6122.082,6125.352,Everything from travel and training to salary and overtime.,173,,
921,0.97,6125.352,6133.093,We're going to go into a detailed dive on all of it.,173,,
922,0.97,6133.093,6136.096,It also requires pay reporting.,173,,
923,0.97,6136.096,6138.799,"Officer pay specifically those officers making over $150,000.",173,,
924,0.97,6138.799,6139.9,We'll be going into that.,173,,
925,0.97,6139.9,6150.978,"Right off the bat, I'll tell you that my analysis there was there is one so far, that has made over $150,000.",173,,
926,0.97,6150.978,6152.279,And that is it so far.,173,,
927,0.97,6152.279,6159.086,"But as we progress, I expect that will continue.",173,,
928,0.97,6159.086,6168.228,There is another slide that is on overtime.,173,,
929,0.97,6168.228,6168.529,Spd002B003.,173,,
930,0.97,6168.529,6171.632,This again dives into a great deal of overtime.,173,,
931,0.97,6171.632,6179.072,"How SPD uses overtime, and we'll be looking at its use compared to last year.",173,,
932,0.97,6179.072,6179.84,And it's categorical use.,173,,
933,0.97,6179.84,6185.179,"How it uses over time on special events, versus patrol Augmentation.",173,,
934,0.97,6185.179,6194.288,We'll get down to a very detailed level.,173,,
935,0.97,6194.288,6195.355,The number 3 . 003A003 is on staffing.,173,,
936,0.97,6195.355,6201.328,This is in the news quite a bit.,173,,
937,0.97,6201.328,6216.476,"Spd has suffered a great loss in patrol staffing, and sworn staffing and will be talking in detail about sworn staffing, and how that has manifested itself in separations.",173,,
938,0.97,6216.476,6227.654,And how we are going to see the Department will see a great deal of salary savings.,173,,
939,0.97,6227.654,6239.666,"And then Lastly, number 4, Spd06003 quarterly reports on what I would call performance Metrics, which are really response times.",173,,
940,0.97,6239.666,6245.672,"And this year, SPD is focusing in on priority response calls, which we will get to.",173,,
941,0.97,6245.672,6249.309,Times that they have to go to priority response handling.,173,,
942,0.97,6249.309,6260.253,"Times that they have to focus their response on priority calls, and not go to lesser priority calls.",173,,
943,0.97,6260.253,6266.627,"So we'll go ahead and jump into Finance monitoring, which is the first point.",173,,
944,0.97,6266.627,6278.572,"As members are aware from my many boring presentations so far over the last year, there are three big categories that SPD spends its money on.",173,,
945,0.97,6278.572,6286.68,"And those are salary and benefits, overtime, and allocated costs.",173,,
946,0.97,6286.68,6291.852,These particular categories represent anywhere between 95 and 97% expenditures for the Department.,173,,
947,0.97,6291.852,6305.565,"As you look as these expenditures over the last six months, what you can see it that last year the Department spent $192 million on salary benefits overtime, and allocated costs.",173,,
948,0.97,6305.565,6310.537,And that this year they have spent $167 million on these expenses.,173,,
949,0.97,6310.537,6317.444,And that these represent 95% of the expansions that SPD has made in the six months.,173,,
950,0.97,6317.444,6322.015,"And so, what does that say?",173,,
951,0.97,6322.015,6331.124,"Well, it says that the agency has reduced its cost by about $13 million, and saved a lot of General Fund.",173,,
952,0.97,6331.124,6341.635,Most of this is due to the departure of the officers and salary savings of salaries not being spent.,173,,
953,0.97,6341.635,6346.473,So that's the biggest reason that you're seeing lack of expenditure here.,173,,
954,0.97,6346.473,6362.622,"You see a difference in the way the expenditures are being represented in the Donut graphs here, because as you can see, overtime is quite a bit down.",173,,
955,0.97,6362.622,6367.227,6% this year versus 10% last year.,173,,
956,0.97,6367.227,6372.466,"That change derives the percentage change in salary, benefits, and also in allocated costs.",173,,
957,0.97,6372.466,6377.07,"With that, and sort of a big picture, I'm jump into how that looks against the budget.",173,,
958,0.97,6377.07,6385.245,So what you hear and see here are those three big expenditures against measured against the budget.,173,,
959,0.97,6385.245,6390.917,And measured against the budget last year and this year.,173,,
960,0.97,6390.917,6398.692,"So on the left hand column, salary, benefits, overtime, and allocated costs.",173,,
961,0.97,6398.692,6401.661,"The middle column, January to June 2020.",173,,
962,0.97,6401.661,6404.564,"And the far right, January to June 2021.",173,,
963,0.97,6404.564,6405.532,"First row, salary and benefits.",173,,
964,0.97,6405.532,6421.815,"You would expect to see that halfway through the year and this is exactly halfway through the year from a payroll standpoint, there would be 50% of salary and benefits that have been spent.",173,,
965,0.97,6421.815,6422.215,Only 48% here.,173,,
966,0.97,6422.215,6434.561,"You have heard that there are a great deal of salary savings in the Department this year, and it may be at the top of your head why only 48%?",173,,
967,0.97,6434.561,6435.562,Why not something like 45%?,173,,
968,0.97,6435.562,6436.897,Or much lower.,173,,
969,0.97,6436.897,6443.17,What I would tell you is that many of the officers that have left have left in the last few months.,173,,
970,0.97,6443.17,6443.937,The last couple months.,173,,
971,0.97,6443.937,6454.047,So the salary savings that those officers are going to provide to the Department are not going to accrue until really the last six months.,173,,
972,0.97,6454.047,6465.792,"And that's important to note, because when we start talking about salary Savings and throwing numbers around, like 15 million, we'll get to that later.",173,,
973,0.97,6465.792,6474.801,"That's, those are savings that are starting to accrue now, but that will be accruing throughout the entire year.",173,,
974,0.97,6474.801,6494.988,"And so another thing to note here as we look at the expenditures versus budget is that on the overtime row you'll see that in 2021, 44% of the overtime budget has been expended.",173,,
975,0.97,6494.988,6502.095,That is not as good as one might think.,173,,
976,0.97,6502.095,6508.301,"The challenge here is that SPD is, it's been seasonally when it comes to overtime.",173,,
977,0.97,6508.301,6514.407,"A lot of the overtime that SPD spends is on patrol Augmentation, and on events.",173,,
978,0.97,6514.407,6526.686,"That is mostly spent in the summer, when there is more of a need for patrol Augmentation, more people are out, or in the summer and fall for sporting events, for the Seahawks.",173,,
979,0.97,6526.686,6530.724,For various kinds of events around the city.,173,,
980,0.97,6530.724,6543.336,"And so the fact that through June, 44% of the budget is already spent is not a good thing.",173,,
981,0.97,6543.336,6555.215,"Especially considering that events are slow to ramp up this year because of Covid, and many events are still public events may or June were suspended or canceled.",173,,
982,0.97,6555.215,6566.893,"That is, I think a measure that is saying that SPD may not have enough budget to make it through the year, especially considering that events are starting to ramp up much more quickly.",173,,
983,0.97,6566.893,6568.828,We're seeing the Seahawks come Online.,173,,
984,0.97,6568.828,6570.43,We're seeing the Sounders come Online.,173,,
985,0.97,6570.43,6586.112,"Many of the events that we thought might not happen due to Covid, the vaccine came around much faster than expected.",173,,
986,0.97,6586.112,6591.217,There's good news and bad news when you look at this row.,173,,
987,0.97,6591.217,6596.156,"The good news is, compared to 2020, about half as much spending.",173,,
988,0.97,6596.156,6597.357,There's other reasons there.,173,,
989,0.97,6597.357,6609.336,"But the bad news is, there may not be enough budget there going forward, and we'll be talking about that in a few minutes.",173,,
990,0.97,6609.336,6612.339,Why the massive spending of overtime in 2020?,173,,
991,0.97,6612.339,6618.345,That has to do with demonstrations and we'll get into that.,173,,
992,0.97,6618.345,6622.415,We'll be doing a detailed dive on overtime here in a minute.,173,,
993,0.97,6622.415,6629.456,So I'm going to go into the smaller stuff now.,173,,
994,0.97,6629.456,6637.731,"I think that you're familiar with the smaller stuff, but I'll go ahead and do sort of a high level overview of it.",173,,
995,0.97,6637.731,6656.316,"As you look at the smaller categories, they represent in January and June of 2021, 5% of expenditures are only $9.6 million, so a very small amount of SPD's budget.",173,,
996,0.97,6656.316,6660.587,"Servicesconsultent, and other legal categories, hold things like contracts for professional services.",173,,
997,0.97,6660.587,6664.29,An example here would be the city's red light cameras.,173,,
998,0.97,6664.29,6669.229,And that's like half of the budget for that category.,173,,
999,0.97,6669.229,6677.537,"Other charges category, pay is for rental of building, such as the OPA offices or the evidence warehouse.",173,,
1000,0.97,6677.537,6685.612,It also pays for fuel for vehicles that don't fuel up at FAS locations.,173,,
1001,0.97,6685.612,6690.617,"The entire budget for that category is $4.4 million, so it's 1.2% of the entire budget.",173,,
1002,0.97,6690.617,6693.153,It's a very small piece.,173,,
1003,0.97,6693.153,6699.225,"Finally, the discretionary purchases category is used for purchase everything else.",173,,
1004,0.97,6699.225,6701.327,"This would include uniforms, guns, office supplies.",173,,
1005,0.97,6701.327,6709.269,Even things like water in a is used to supply officers at special events.,173,,
1006,0.97,6709.269,6715.275,"So you can see the make up here greatly changed, because of separation pay.",173,,
1007,0.97,6715.275,6735.228,"You can also see that the makeup has changed because of capital, additional expenditures in Capitol, and additional expenditures in well, I guess just in some of the discretionary, or I'm sorry, some of the other charges.",173,,
1008,0.97,6735.228,6738.531,We'll get to that right now.,173,,
1009,0.97,6738.531,6745.939,Here's a breakdown of those charges against budget.,173,,
1010,0.97,6745.939,6746.606,So separation pay.,173,,
1011,0.97,6746.606,6755.381,"Again, here you've got the rows that equate to the pie chart that I just showed you.",173,,
1012,0.97,6755.381,6758.985,"You've got 2020 expenses against budget, and 2021 expenses against budget.",173,,
1013,0.97,6758.985,6762.222,"Separation pay, not so great against budget.",173,,
1014,0.97,6762.222,6769.829,Blown out of the water against budget.,173,,
1015,0.97,6769.829,6774.367,Legal and other service consultants.,173,,
1016,0.97,6774.367,6775.168,45% against budget.,173,,
1017,0.97,6775.168,6776.035,Then also capital.,173,,
1018,0.97,6776.035,6778.138,"2,000 some against budget.",173,,
1019,0.97,6778.138,6779.706,Why are those so high?,173,,
1020,0.97,6779.706,6784.711,They're high because SPD has started spending some of its salary savings in those two categories.,173,,
1021,0.97,6784.711,6805.865,"They have started spending some of the salary and savings that they have available now for replacement of technology items, specifically their Dap technology item that they needed to get going now.",173,,
1022,0.97,6805.865,6811.938,"They have contracts with Exenture, and those break down into Capitol, and also consulting and other.",173,,
1023,0.97,6811.938,6821.281,That's why those two categories jump out at a higher level than you might expect to see at this point in the year.,173,,
1024,0.97,6821.281,6836.362,"While you can see that travel and training is 19% against budget, it's still lower than last year.",173,,
1025,0.97,6836.362,6844.337,"And that, I guess is, that I guess is the sum of that particular slide.",173,,
1026,0.97,6844.337,6847.807,Just a quick question here.,174,,
1027,0.97,6847.807,6865.692,"So on the capital expenditures as it relates to what was budgeted, is this the category for which the police Department's proposal requests upwards of $2 million for technology?",174,,
1028,0.97,6865.692,6878.404,"Yeah, it's broken down between capital and other charges and some legal service consultants and other, I believe.",175,,
1029,0.97,6878.404,6879.439,"Definitely between other charges, and capital.",175,,
1030,0.97,6879.439,6889.449,"Angela, do you want to jump in and correct me?",175,,
1031,0.97,6889.449,6889.882,That's correct.,176,,
1032,0.97,6889.882,6890.083,Yeah.,176,,
1033,0.97,6890.083,6890.35,Okay.,177,,
1034,0.97,6890.35,6944.47,"So if the Council were to approve the expenditure, the technology related expenditures, which I think we'll get into a little bit more detail further on, this will sort of correct the percentage of adopted budget from nearly 3,000 percent of what was adopted to be consistent with budget, and just really not understanding why, one why the funding if necessary, in this category for Capital/Technology was known, why it wasn't included in the Mayor's proposed 2021 budget.",177,,
1035,0.97,6944.47,6956.716,"And two, and I'll have the same question with some other items that Greg's presentation notes you're already spending.",177,,
1036,0.97,6956.716,6975.101,Is it an accepted budget practice to move forward on spending in areas that the Council has not authorized yet?,177,,
1037,0.97,6975.101,6993.72,Just really trying to move to a place where we have a common set of expectations that Council approving moves funds from one Bcl to another before the Department moves forward in spending those funds?,177,,
1038,0.97,6993.72,7026.886,"If the spending in this category in a is apparently currently happening now is accomplished by moving the patrol staffing excess funding from the patrol staffing budget control level into a different budget control level, I just want to understand is it an accepted budget policy to move forward with that spending before the Council has authorized it?",177,,
1039,0.97,7026.886,7027.153,Yes.,178,,
1040,0.97,7027.153,7030.023,I'll try to respond to the multipart.,178,,
1041,0.97,7030.023,7040.7,"So what you're seeing here is, excuse me, a breakout by expense category at the account level, or the account type.",178,,
1042,0.97,7040.7,7058.484,"So you have, for example, the capital account, which, across all of the BSL's, and even down to the project level in some cases, we are budgeting in some cases at the account level.",178,,
1043,0.97,7058.484,7064.69,"In other cases, we're allocating budget to you know, the salary line, or the benefit lines.",178,,
1044,0.97,7064.69,7077.136,"What the legal budget controls or requires is that we operate within our budget control level, or our budget summary level.",178,,
1045,0.97,7077.136,7086.679,So the law restricts us from moving money between those budget summary levels.,178,,
1046,0.97,7086.679,7092.919,But oftentimes the budget doesn't always perfectly align at the account level.,178,,
1047,0.97,7092.919,7097.557,"So an example being historically, we've used salary savings to finance separation pay.",178,,
1048,0.97,7097.557,7106.632,"If you were to look at the separation pay account and isolation, you would see an overage in that account.",178,,
1049,0.97,7106.632,7120.346,"But we didn't necessarily violate budget rules, because we had sufficient funding in another account to Off-Set that overage, if that makes sense.",178,,
1050,0.97,7120.346,7128.387,It sounds like you're talking about for accounts.,179,,
1051,0.97,7128.387,7130.189,But I'm talking about different Dcl's.,179,,
1052,0.97,7130.189,7137.864,"I think what Angela is saying is that at this level, they're all up to multiple BSL's.",180,,
1053,0.97,7137.864,7144.337,So you could have a capital account in every single BSL.,180,,
1054,0.97,7144.337,7148.274,Every single BSL could have a capital account.,180,,
1055,0.97,7148.274,7167.96,And the reason that it's over budget is because Accenture is a weird expenditure that got recorded as capital because some technician recorded it that way.,180,,
1056,0.97,7167.96,7182.508,"But this is sort of a different question than the one you're getting at, which is more relevant at the end, when we're talking about controlling it at the BSL level.",180,,
1057,0.97,7182.508,7182.909,Super helpful.,181,,
1058,0.97,7182.909,7186.846,Thank you.,181,,
1059,0.97,7186.846,7187.513,All right.,182,,
1060,0.97,7187.513,7188.18,So jump into overtime.,182,,
1061,0.97,7188.18,7190.55,So I should have done this the other way.,182,,
1062,0.97,7190.55,7196.789,"I should have started out with the big one, but I started out with the little one.",182,,
1063,0.97,7196.789,7200.459,So these are the categories of smaller overtime expenditures.,182,,
1064,0.97,7200.459,7205.798,And as you can see here these are the overtime hours.,182,,
1065,0.97,7205.798,7207.033,These are not dollars.,182,,
1066,0.97,7207.033,7210.036,Hours that were spent between January and June.,182,,
1067,0.97,7210.036,7214.907,"This year, in this slide there's a three year history.",182,,
1068,0.97,7214.907,7228.054,"And what you can see here is the various bureaus where spending has occurred, between zero and 25,000 hours.",182,,
1069,0.97,7228.054,7236.462,"And so what you can see is for the most part, like last time, that overtime spending is down in most categories.",182,,
1070,0.97,7236.462,7244.07,"There are a couple places that overtime spending is up, and I want to point that out.",182,,
1071,0.97,7244.07,7246.339,"Special operations, overtime spending is up.",182,,
1072,0.97,7246.339,7256.182,"And that has to, I've dug into the data there, and that has to do with the fact that the Swat team has made a lot of call outs on Barricaded subjects.",182,,
1073,0.97,7256.182,7258.618,I don't know why that is.,182,,
1074,0.97,7258.618,7262.955,Apparently there are more Barricaded subjects that have happened in the last since months than normal.,182,,
1075,0.97,7262.955,7279.338,"We can get more information on that for you, but that sort of is just the way that broke out.",182,,
1076,0.97,7279.338,7280.439,That's the special operations one.,182,,
1077,0.97,7280.439,7290.316,"The chief operating officer, as you see, is the 21 bar is just slightly ahead of the 20 bar.",182,,
1078,0.97,7290.316,7290.816,It's not a lot.,182,,
1079,0.97,7290.816,7297.757,"But digging into that, what I find is that the communications section over time is higher.",182,,
1080,0.97,7297.757,7315.741,"Experience there would show that usually when the communication section over time is higher, it's because 911 Dispatchers and 911 call takers, there is usually some sort of a staffing shortage there.",182,,
1081,0.97,7315.741,7330.189,And there's a situation where overtime is being used to help with a staffing shortage to meet minimum staffing requirements for that situation.,182,,
1082,0.97,7330.189,7335.094,And that's something that I'll need to follow up and get back to you on.,182,,
1083,0.97,7335.094,7338.898,That may or may not be the case.,182,,
1084,0.97,7338.898,7345.471,I'll ask Angela if she has any more insight into that.,182,,
1085,0.97,7345.471,7351.644,I'm going to pause here and see if any of me colleagues have a question on the slide.,183,,
1086,0.97,7351.644,7353.079,I have a few.,183,,
1087,0.97,7353.079,7364.79,"So I have questions, first of all, I want to just thank SPD for tracking overtime pay believe.",183,,
1088,0.97,7364.79,7375.801,"I appreciate that level of attention, especially considering that the work in the time keeping solution is to my understanding, not up and running again.",183,,
1089,0.97,7375.801,7381.073,That will be an automated approach for tracking over time.,183,,
1090,0.97,7381.073,7396.822,"But in the meantime, really appreciate the chief's leadership in sort of the more labor intensive approach of tracking this.",183,,
1091,0.97,7396.822,7405.03,And just a couple questions about the work and scheduling time system.,183,,
1092,0.97,7405.03,7413.973,Just interested whether or not maybe SPD can answer this for me.,183,,
1093,0.97,7413.973,7419.211,Will the new automated system be implemented soon?,183,,
1094,0.97,7419.211,7431.69,"Because the 2020 auditors follow up report on recommendations that we received earlier this year, it indicated that it would be completed in the second quarter.",183,,
1095,0.97,7431.69,7441.333,But yet there was a quote in the press recently.,183,,
1096,0.97,7441.333,7450.81,"Very recently, that the spokesperson from SPD said there's no set timetable for the implementation.",183,,
1097,0.97,7450.81,7465.391,"And so I'm just concerned that the city auditor is being told one thing, when they're doing their work to monitor implementation of audit recommendations.",183,,
1098,0.97,7465.391,7468.16,They do that annual report.,183,,
1099,0.97,7468.16,7475.534,"And so again, the city auditor was told it was this time.",183,,
1100,0.97,7475.534,7481.34,And work Scheduleing system would be up and running second quarter of this year.,183,,
1101,0.97,7481.34,7491.984,"But yet, in a very recent newspaper article the SPD spokesperson said there's no set timetable for implementation.",183,,
1102,0.97,7491.984,7496.522,So then I have another question related to the Wst system.,183,,
1103,0.97,7496.522,7518.577,"A little separate from overtime, but also something that I know there's a lot of concern about and a lot of Unimplement the recommendations from the auditor, and also an executive order from years ago, and this is related to the tracking of off-duty time.",183,,
1104,0.97,7518.577,7540.266,"In February, I believe it was February of 2020, chief Diaz wrote to me saying that although the work schedule and time keeping system could theoretically track off duty time, it wasn't scoped to do so.",183,,
1105,0.97,7540.266,7553.913,And so there is a lot of concern about the transparency around officers working off duty.,183,,
1106,0.97,7553.913,7562.288,"And frankly, also concerns about how off duty work effects availability and readiness for On-Duty work.",183,,
1107,0.97,7562.288,7569.328,So just wondering if you could respond to those two questions.,183,,
1108,0.97,7569.328,7573.132,"Yeah, happy first to address the work scheduling time keeping project.",184,,
1109,0.97,7573.132,7591.617,"When we provided the status update to the auditor's office we were set for deployment of, or roll out of the schedule time keeping system this year.",184,,
1110,0.97,7591.617,7600.693,"We had issues specifically in our payroll system of the testing phase of the new system which caused, we convened with Seattle I.T.",184,,
1111,0.97,7600.693,7616.475,"And it was determined that we hadn't achieved the, we haven't met expectations around the testing of the system and making sure there would be a smooth implementation.",184,,
1112,0.97,7616.475,7622.681,So it was decided at that point to put the project on hold.,184,,
1113,0.97,7622.681,7634.193,"We have convened with Seattle I.T., the Mayor's office, and have come up with a plan moving forward.",184,,
1114,0.97,7634.193,7638.697,We are scheduled to kick off Seattle I.T.,184,,
1115,0.97,7638.697,7655.28,"Is going to organize a kickoff event so we can assess where the project exactly left off, learn from the fire Department's roll out of the same system and establish a new Timeline for the SPD portion of the project.",184,,
1116,0.97,7655.28,7660.986,Happy to follow up with you as that Timeline is developed.,184,,
1117,0.97,7660.986,7681.44,"In the meantime, we do continue to prepare detailed reports, overtime reports on a Biweekly basis for commanders all the way up to the chief level, and will continue to do the manual reporting until the system goes live.",184,,
1118,0.97,7681.44,7683.475,It's still definitely a priority from SPD.,184,,
1119,0.97,7683.475,7689.081,"Not only from a monitoring stand point, but from a scheduling stand point.",184,,
1120,0.97,7689.081,7696.021,"And if there was a Disconnect between the auditor, status update, that was Unintentional.",184,,
1121,0.97,7696.021,7702.728,"As for off duty, I can only Chris can Chime in, if he wants to add on.",184,,
1122,0.97,7702.728,7714.973,But the chief is correct that we didn't Configure the original kind of phase one roll out of the work scheduling time keeping to include off-duty work.,184,,
1123,0.97,7714.973,7720.245,That is monitored through a separate manual process as well.,184,,
1124,0.97,7720.245,7727.252,"Dr. Fisher, anything to add to that?",185,,
1125,0.97,7727.252,7728.12,Thanks chair Herbold.,186,,
1126,0.97,7728.12,7749.408,"I think as the chief noted in I believe it was his February communication, we're also working through, and I do believe I'm not in that room, that any significant changes to how off duty works and is tracked could potentially both have long term fiscal and labor implications for the city.",186,,
1127,0.97,7749.408,7770.762,"So I believe any sort of further restriction or monitoring than what we're doing when this conversation was last joined after Mayor Burgess issued that executive order, I'm certain to Reclarify with the labor attorneys, but I believe we reached the point where this is doing much more around off duty.",186,,
1128,0.97,7770.762,7793.619,"Either got very close to or directly involved giving in to labor discussions around what was permitted, and how much control you could have over what someone does in their time, when they're not working for the city, technically, but you can follow up on that.",186,,
1129,0.97,7793.619,7793.986,Thank you.,187,,
1130,0.97,7793.986,7809.468,"Just because I recently reviewed that memo from the chief, I just want to flag my interest in ensuring that this system is scoped, in fact off duty work.",187,,
1131,0.97,7809.468,7820.712,We have not been able to locate any city attorney advice on the issue of pension cost impacts of tracking off duty work officers.,187,,
1132,0.97,7820.712,7843.101,"I would appreciate very much if you would share that information with the city attorney's office, that I've had them looking into it, and they have recently reported as recently as this morning, saying that they're not able to track down that advice.",187,,
1133,0.97,7843.101,7857.349,"And chief Diaz's letter suggested that by tracking Off- duty work, not controlling it, but just that first step of tracking it would put the city on the hook for costs associated with increased pension costs.",187,,
1134,0.97,7857.349,7866.758,So really hoping we can track that down.,187,,
1135,0.97,7866.758,7870.863,Thanks.,187,,
1136,0.97,7870.863,7880.072,"Okay so I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next category, which is the larger categories of overtime spending.",188,,
1137,0.97,7880.072,7886.878,"The three big ones here, as you can see, go up to 120,000 hours.",188,,
1138,0.97,7886.878,7900.025,"The one that's probably the most concerning is patrol operations, as you can see has nearly doubled since last year, 2021 to 2020.",188,,
1139,0.97,7900.025,7923.115,"As you dig into that one, what you can see is that, I would say between 2/3Rds and 3/4Ths, just eye balling it of all the control levels are for control Augmentation, either for minimum staffing or sick leave coverage.",188,,
1140,0.97,7923.115,7929.721,The other overtime expenses are just tiny.,188,,
1141,0.97,7929.721,7934.359,"They make up maybe 1/3, maybe 25%.",188,,
1142,0.97,7934.359,7935.427,It's almost all patrol August Amation.,188,,
1143,0.97,7935.427,7938.597,That is something that's just way up in 2021.,188,,
1144,0.97,7938.597,7948.874,"As we get to staffing and Previcinity staffing, I think that we'll talk a little bit more about some potential causes for that.",188,,
1145,0.97,7948.874,7956.214,You can see that events including Seattle center is creeping up.,188,,
1146,0.97,7956.214,7962.421,And I wouldn't compare that to 2020.,188,,
1147,0.97,7962.421,7965.123,I'd compare that to 2019.,188,,
1148,0.97,7965.123,7968.327,"2020, that contains the expenditures for demonstrations.",188,,
1149,0.97,7968.327,7973.632,And that includes an $8 million expenditure for demonstrations.,188,,
1150,0.97,7973.632,7986.211,"$8Million was not the sum of the expenditures for demonstrations for last summer, it was just the expenditures for demonstrations from May through June.",188,,
1151,0.97,7986.211,7988.947,There were other expenditures in July.,188,,
1152,0.97,7988.947,7996.421,But the $8 million severely Skews that particular column.,188,,
1153,0.97,7996.421,8008.266,"But if you compare what you're seeing in 2021, to 2019, knowing that there have not been a lot of demonstrations this year, you can see that events are coming back.",188,,
1154,0.97,8008.266,8034.126,"You can also see that in the sporting events column, that they're coming back, and that's a cause for concern, given what I showed you earlier, running against with overtime running against budget at 44% so far this year, just even through June.",188,,
1155,0.97,8034.126,8034.693,So staffing.,188,,
1156,0.97,8034.693,8036.495,Moving into staffing.,188,,
1157,0.97,8036.495,8040.999,"Staffing so far this year, Actuals.",188,,
1158,0.97,8040.999,8042.834,January through June.,188,,
1159,0.97,8042.834,8043.168,Separations.,188,,
1160,0.97,8043.168,8045.604,100 separations so far this year.,188,,
1161,0.97,8045.604,8058.316,The original staffing plan that was adopted as part of the 2014 adopted budget predicted that there would be 114 separations for the entire year.,188,,
1162,0.97,8058.316,8064.89,And there are 100 separations just through half a year.,188,,
1163,0.97,8064.89,8066.358,So that's significant.,188,,
1164,0.97,8066.358,8083.241,And that is the main reason why you'll see in the next slide that there's a projection of 15 some million in salary savings that is available this year.,188,,
1165,0.97,8083.241,8085.444,Fire is not great.,188,,
1166,0.97,8085.444,8093.285,There was a freeze at the Academy due to Covid for the last several months.,188,,
1167,0.97,8093.285,8094.419,"Year, the fall anyway.",188,,
1168,0.97,8094.419,8101.293,"So the hires that SPD was making in the fall, those folks had to sit and wait.",188,,
1169,0.97,8101.293,8106.298,They entered the Academy in January all in one big group at the same time.,188,,
1170,0.97,8106.298,8112.704,They entered as part of a Seattle only class.,188,,
1171,0.97,8112.704,8119.578,"So of those 38 that have been hired, 21 were in January and the rest were spread out amongst the five months since then.",188,,
1172,0.97,8119.578,8127.519,So not a lot per month have been hired.,188,,
1173,0.97,8127.519,8139.331,"The June through December projections were supplied by SPD, and the good news, I'm happy that SPD supplied the projections.",188,,
1174,0.97,8139.331,8152.711,"And based on the assumptions that they have provided for the staffing plan, these are, I think reasonable projections, and we'll be getting into the assumptions here in a minute.",188,,
1175,0.97,8152.711,8154.012,At least on the hiring side.,188,,
1176,0.97,8154.012,8157.582,"The separation side, it's really difficult to know.",188,,
1177,0.97,8157.582,8163.989,"The separation side, they have projected there will be 60 more.",188,,
1178,0.97,8163.989,8166.224,"And so obviously, the original projection was 114.",188,,
1179,0.97,8166.224,8172.664,"If it goes the way SPD think it is will go, there will be 160 at the end of the year.",188,,
1180,0.97,8172.664,8177.269,Spd believes that it's going to get 49 more hires by the end of the year.,188,,
1181,0.97,8177.269,8182.874,And we'll go into the assumptions there in a second.,188,,
1182,0.97,8182.874,8184.809,Looking at the chart here before you.,188,,
1183,0.97,8184.809,8203.628,What you see is fully trained officers and officers in service to review fully trained officers or officers that are just that.,188,,
1184,0.97,8203.628,8205.397,They've been through their year of training.,188,,
1185,0.97,8205.397,8214.039,You can take one of these officers and put them on the street.,188,,
1186,0.97,8214.039,8239.931,"Deployable officers but taking out the folks that are on extended sick leave or disability, or are otherwise as you can see, looking at this graph, if you go back to 2019, Q1 of 2019, the difference between fully trained officers and officers in service was not that great.",188,,
1187,0.97,8239.931,8245.103,"It has always been, it's always been about what you can see throughout 2019.",188,,
1188,0.97,8245.103,8255.08,"Then when you hit the summer of 2020, it balloons into 100 some officers that are out on disability.",188,,
1189,0.97,8255.08,8257.482,And it has not yet recovered.,188,,
1190,0.97,8257.482,8264.689,"It is still the case that there are as of this last month, 108 officers that are not deployable right now.",188,,
1191,0.97,8264.689,8267.993,That are out on long term disability.,188,,
1192,0.97,8267.993,8272.063,"So that is, or out on long term leave.",188,,
1193,0.97,8272.063,8278.87,"Some of it would be family leave for Childcare purposes, or other purposes.",188,,
1194,0.97,8278.87,8293.952,"So for one reason or another, there are 108 officers that are not deployable, and that is hurting the Department's ability to field officers for 911 calls.",188,,
1195,0.97,8293.952,8297.689,We just pause here?,189,,
1196,0.97,8297.689,8297.956,Yeah.,190,,
1197,0.97,8297.956,8304.963,I appreciate the emphasis on the officers out on leave.,191,,
1198,0.97,8304.963,8320.211,It looks like we had a high of about 140 officers on leave in the fourth quarter of 2020.,191,,
1199,0.97,8320.211,8327.719,"As you mention, we're down to, what's the difference between --",191,,
1200,0.97,8327.719,8328.019,108.,192,,
1201,0.97,8328.019,8329.821,108 was last month.,192,,
1202,0.97,8329.821,8336.594,"Okay, I'm seeing the difference between 186 and 165.",193,,
1203,0.97,8336.594,8340.732,So that's less than 100.,193,,
1204,0.97,8340.732,8343.334,Those are the projected.,194,,
1205,0.97,8343.334,8344.436,"1165, and the --",194,,
1206,0.97,8344.436,8346.304,"That's a dotted line, got it.",195,,
1207,0.97,8346.304,8356.281,"So you mentioned, you don't have a lot of information about why these numbers are still so high.",195,,
1208,0.97,8356.281,8364.723,"For numbers of officers out on leave, I'm just wondering if SPD can speak to that?",195,,
1209,0.97,8364.723,8372.731,I do actually have the categories of three of the folks out.,196,,
1210,0.97,8372.731,8385.677,"They break out with worker's COMP, sick leave, an accrued benefits being probably the two highest categories making up somewhere around Oh, 75 of the 108.",196,,
1211,0.97,8385.677,8393.852,"And then the rest of them being family medical leave, parental leave, medical leave, and administrative leave.",196,,
1212,0.97,8393.852,8395.019,Appreciate those categories.,197,,
1213,0.97,8395.019,8406.798,But I don't think those categories necessarily tell the story about why it's higher than normal.,197,,
1214,0.97,8406.798,8407.065,Sure.,198,,
1215,0.97,8407.065,8409.134,I'll take a stab at that one.,199,,
1216,0.97,8409.134,8427.585,"I don't know if we have a specific answer because we're not really allowed to, maybe hr can, I don't know if they can share it, but at a command level, we've can't really asked people why they've taken particular leave.",199,,
1217,0.97,8427.585,8445.637,"But generally what we hear is after, you know, an exhausting year from the pandemic, and everything else, there were a lot of officers who had issues they had not addressed, you know, who may have been injured, or just needed time away.",199,,
1218,0.97,8445.637,8453.144,"We also know that with an aging workforce, we have seen Upticks in our retirements.",199,,
1219,0.97,8453.144,8471.563,"Some individuals, as they have earned their sick time, decide to seek the medical attention that they've got covered under their health insurance and their sick leave, and to take care of these issues, maybe before they end their employment with the city.",199,,
1220,0.97,8471.563,8475.3,So I think there's a lot of that.,199,,
1221,0.97,8475.3,8482.14,"I think just together, it's a lot of folks after a year and a half I think was stressful for everyone.",199,,
1222,0.97,8482.14,8487.345,"If we were having a conversation about crime and violence, they would probably factor into that conversation as well.",199,,
1223,0.97,8487.345,8493.585,But I think that's part of it.,199,,
1224,0.97,8493.585,8505.697,"And also folks maybe had put off having a family, when we talk about parental leave and some other effects, just the last year and a half changed I think a lot of people's Dynamics and professional life.",199,,
1225,0.97,8505.697,8511.202,We're seeing some of that play out now.,199,,
1226,0.97,8511.202,8512.103,"Thank you, Dr. Fisher.",200,,
1227,0.97,8512.103,8538.763,It will be really interesting to see a comparison of leave time for other frontline workers who have experienced similar trauma and stress associated with all the really important work that so many of our frontline workers have been doing.,200,,
1228,0.97,8538.763,8546.971,And just kind of check our assumptions that there's nothing unusual going on with a particular Department.,200,,
1229,0.97,8546.971,8551.309,Thank you.,200,,
1230,0.97,8551.309,8555.146,Councilmember Herbold.,200,,
1231,0.97,8555.146,8555.48,So sorry.,201,,
1232,0.97,8555.48,8557.882,I will use my hand in the future.,201,,
1233,0.97,8557.882,8564.622,"I think there may have been another Councilmember in front of me, since I am not on your Committee, I will defer.",201,,
1234,0.97,8564.622,8568.76,I'm not seeing a hand up in the virtual hand.,202,,
1235,0.97,8568.76,8572.43,I see Councilmember Pedersen.,203,,
1236,0.97,8572.43,8573.431,There you go.,204,,
1237,0.97,8573.431,8574.232,Sorry about that.,204,,
1238,0.97,8574.232,8574.732,Councilmember Pedersen.,204,,
1239,0.97,8574.732,8581.606,"Thank you, chair Herbold, and thank you for providing space in your committee to have these periodic reports.",205,,
1240,0.97,8581.606,8590.281,"I'm just an alternate at the committee, so I'm able to be here and vote because one of the other Councilmembers on the committee is not here.",205,,
1241,0.97,8590.281,8603.227,But I wanted to just note that I did attend a couple of role calls at the beginning of shifts of some of our SPD officers.,205,,
1242,0.97,8603.227,8616.774,"With I'm looking at this number of attrition, and I believe we've lost maybe 200 officers up to this point, and that's a net after hiring some more officers.",205,,
1243,0.97,8616.774,8626.084,"Then we're seeing this estimate for the 60 additional officers, and I just, I wanted to ask a little more about the assumptions behind that.",205,,
1244,0.97,8626.084,8659.517,"Because during the role call it seemed that the morale is very low and I'm concerned about officer wellness and just want to know what the strategies could be to retain our best officers, and because in terms of in the North Precinct, it's a very large geographic area, and you know, not seeing a lot of officers there, because there has been this attrition is concerning.",205,,
1245,0.97,8659.517,8662.453,And when we look at 911 response times as well.,205,,
1246,0.97,8662.453,8665.723,I know we're striving to set up alternatives.,205,,
1247,0.97,8665.723,8671.529,"Alternative responses in a lot of cases, and that takes time as we discussed earlier.",205,,
1248,0.97,8671.529,8685.543,"And so, I'm just wondering, I'd like to know what we're going to do to try to retain the officers we do have, with strategies that we're contemplating.",205,,
1249,0.97,8685.543,8689.647,Thank you.,205,,
1250,0.97,8689.647,8698.389,"Councilmember Pedersen, was that a question to SPD, or a question to the committee?",206,,
1251,0.97,8698.389,8699.057,"I'm sorry, I wasn't sure.",206,,
1252,0.97,8699.057,8705.596,"I would, at the discretion of the chair, I would love to hear from SPD on that.",207,,
1253,0.97,8705.596,8708.633,I just wanted to make sure.,208,,
1254,0.97,8708.633,8712.336,"Thank you, we are obviously distinctly aware of the morale issue.",208,,
1255,0.97,8712.336,8721.145,"I think that's why the chief has been trying to get as many roll calls as he can, and do messages.",208,,
1256,0.97,8721.145,8730.621,"I think people might actually get tired from hearing from him, as much as he's trying to recognize people for hard work out there helping and serving.",208,,
1257,0.97,8730.621,8738.663,"I think that's part of it, just an internal recognition and support for folks putting their lives on the line.",208,,
1258,0.97,8738.663,8749.307,"I also think there have been discussions, and some of this is being led by the executive around how would we structure some sort of Retension incentive.",208,,
1259,0.97,8749.307,8751.342,I don't know what that would look like.,208,,
1260,0.97,8751.342,8766.657,"I think you start to get into labor, and fiscal things that we do recognize one, it takes time and money to get new people into the Department.",208,,
1261,0.97,8766.657,8782.24,"We know a lot of those separations, a lot of those are younger officers who have been sort of more in the more diverse, some record levels of diversity and recruitment.",208,,
1262,0.97,8782.24,8786.544,Upwards of 40% of the recruits being non-white.,208,,
1263,0.97,8786.544,8793.484,"And so I think we recognize we have, it takes a lot of work to get those folks in.",208,,
1264,0.97,8793.484,8798.756,"Once we get them in, we have to put in a lot of work to keep them.",208,,
1265,0.97,8798.756,8820.111,"If you lose someone within five years, you're basically hiring them twice, which I think is a lot of unnecessary work, where it would have been better served the city to keep the folks who were on, especially those, we know just wept to other policing jobs, if folks decided this is not the profession.",208,,
1266,0.97,8820.111,8830.855,"Father those individuals who decide to be police officers elsewhere, I think that's where, you know, the Mayor's office did the hiring and Retension study.",208,,
1267,0.97,8830.855,8833.157,We saw some of the results there.,208,,
1268,0.97,8833.157,8838.496,I think that's why the sheath has been so strongly pushing to get to a new schedule.,208,,
1269,0.97,8838.496,8844.969,We know that is often raised by officers as a key point.,208,,
1270,0.97,8844.969,8853.344,"Our current schedule, both in terms of the rotating days off, and the shift starts can be stressful.",208,,
1271,0.97,8853.344,8855.546,"Especially on that first watch at 3:00 a.m., it's a tough one.",208,,
1272,0.97,8855.546,8864.422,"So I know we're trying to shift to our 310S, our 410S schedule, that's been labor negotiations around that.",208,,
1273,0.97,8864.422,8873.164,"I believe that would also Resonate well with folks on, and also help us with hiring.",208,,
1274,0.97,8873.164,8873.731,"Thank you, Dr. Fisher.",209,,
1275,0.97,8873.731,8876.601,Councilmember Muss Musqueda.,209,,
1276,0.97,8876.601,8884.642,"Thank you, after all of that, I couldn't find that hand raise button.",210,,
1277,0.97,8884.642,8894.018,"Number one, I think it would be helpful as we continue this conversation especially in the fall to pair this conversation, with the one you just had about investments going out into the community.",210,,
1278,0.97,8894.018,8905.229,"The 10 million plus that is going out from Hsd, the 30 million just authorized at full council yesterday from the equitable communities task force.",210,,
1279,0.97,8905.229,8908.099,The additional 30 million going out from the budgeting process.,210,,
1280,0.97,8908.099,8917.174,The Additioal 30 million that is coming from the sale of the block that will be going into creating additional housing security.,210,,
1281,0.97,8917.174,8933.658,"Because I think when you see some of those investments that are going into alternative strategies to creating additional safety and security and stability for communities, you would be able to then see a chart that pairs a downward trend potentially with an upward trend for investments and community safety and security.",210,,
1282,0.97,8933.658,8938.663,So I'm looking forward to seeing that type of analysis that does that overlap.,210,,
1283,0.97,8938.663,8947.471,"Just a few questions to come back to this chart, looking at quarter four, and quarter three here.",210,,
1284,0.97,8947.471,8958.249,"Quarter four, did I hear you correctly, Greg, that in the quarter four 2020, there was a pause on the training for officers.",210,,
1285,0.97,8958.249,8980.004,"So there really was a bottle neck created because of Covid restrictions, and thus, the inability to scale up the hiring as fast as anticipated in that quarter four, and partially, part of the reason you see such a decline in the officers and service line there.",210,,
1286,0.97,8980.004,8992.016,It is the case that the Academy had had to stop taking students for a few months because of Covid.,211,,
1287,0.97,8992.016,9004.095,"The reason that the officers in service number goes down, is because officers went into either a worker's COMP, or a long term disability situation.",211,,
1288,0.97,9004.095,9006.964,So that's not controlled by hiring per se.,211,,
1289,0.97,9006.964,9025.483,"And to the points earlier about trying to peel back the layers on looking at worker's COMP, and sick leave, and family leave, I really appreciate Dr. Fisher's Multifaceted answer to why we're seeing additional changes both in Lifestyle at home, the contemplation of having a baby.",212,,
1290,0.97,9025.483,9028.953,"Maybe some folks possibly retiring, wanting to take some of that leap.",212,,
1291,0.97,9028.953,9034.325,All of those pieces are really important I think for us to hear and to further analyze.,212,,
1292,0.97,9034.325,9039.063,I also think it's important to look at some of the national health data.,212,,
1293,0.97,9039.063,9062.953,"Some reports out there that talk about the higher rates of access of sick leave last year, and noted that how important it was for workers across various sectors, especially those who are continuing to go into work, to be able to access their sick leave, and to access it actually at higher rates because of all the public health awareness going in to tell people if you're sick, stay home.",212,,
1294,0.97,9062.953,9079.97,"Often I know that in the past, many of us who are really excited to work and wanting to make sure that we're showing up will sometimes go into the office, or sometimes go into our frontline services even when we have access to sick leave in the city and the state.",212,,
1295,0.97,9079.97,9086.41,"We've gone in and kind of risked it, or thought, maybe I'm not that bad.",212,,
1296,0.97,9086.41,9098.522,"The reports from health affairs and others have said that when folks access that sick leave, you actually can attribute a decline in many areas of Covid, because people were Accessing sick leave.",212,,
1297,0.97,9098.522,9120.411,"So I would want to make sure that we're considering as well, Accessing sick leave, Accessing medical leave, Accessing worker's COMP for folks who may have compromised health and well-being is actually a very good thing during this time of crisis.",212,,
1298,0.97,9120.411,9124.515,"Lastly, on the previous chart, slide 10.",212,,
1299,0.97,9124.515,9125.282,Excuse me.,212,,
1300,0.97,9125.282,9126.317,"There we go, that chart.",212,,
1301,0.97,9126.317,9131.522,"I'm sorry, Councilmember, Madam chair, I didn't get my hand raised in time.",212,,
1302,0.97,9131.522,9151.408,"I just want to ask a question, if folks are following along last year, there was a lot of conversation with concern with sworn officers, armed officers being in positions like traffic mitigation at events.",212,,
1303,0.97,9151.408,9158.315,This was a huge topic of a conversation during this year's 2021 legislative session in Olympia.,212,,
1304,0.97,9158.315,9172.696,So can you remind us where we stand currently with removing sworn armed officers from traffic mitigation at events just so that we have a common understanding of where that conversation ended?,212,,
1305,0.97,9172.696,9180.604,Is that a question for central staff?,213,,
1306,0.97,9180.604,9180.871,Yes.,214,,
1307,0.97,9180.871,9205.362,"That is subject of a slide response that SPD has sent to the Council, and it is also most importantly the subject of negotiation that would need to occur between SPD.",215,,
1308,0.97,9205.362,9214.572,There is currently a balance of parking enforcement officers or sworn officers when it comes to traffic enforcement.,215,,
1309,0.97,9214.572,9220.778,And any change in that balance would require negotiation.,215,,
1310,0.97,9220.778,9230.554,It may require negotiation and it may be something that the city needs to handle in its labor relations area.,215,,
1311,0.97,9230.554,9238.829,So that's something that the city would have to take on with its contracts.,215,,
1312,0.97,9238.829,9246.236,So that's Somethig that's ongoing now is what I would say.,215,,
1313,0.97,9246.236,9248.739,"Thank you, Greg.",216,,
1314,0.97,9248.739,9252.176,I would love to move onto Councilmember Lewis.,216,,
1315,0.97,9252.176,9255.412,Thank you for your patience.,216,,
1316,0.97,9255.412,9257.881,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,217,,
1317,0.97,9257.881,9265.122,Going back to the chart that showed the hiring and attrition.,217,,
1318,0.97,9265.122,9267.458,"Yeah, right there.",217,,
1319,0.97,9267.458,9287.144,"For the second half of the year here it looks like there is some optimism regarding anticipated separation and hires with fewer separations for the second half of the year, and more Highers.",217,,
1320,0.97,9287.144,9291.081,What are those things attributed to?,217,,
1321,0.97,9291.081,9298.789,Is this anticipating what impacts some Retension strategies might have for the additional separations?,217,,
1322,0.97,9298.789,9306.53,"And on the additional hires, is that the bottle neck that the Academy getting resolved, and no longer being an issue?",217,,
1323,0.97,9306.53,9310.868,"What are some of the factors there, that are leading into those estimates?",217,,
1324,0.97,9310.868,9311.602,Thank you for asking.,218,,
1325,0.97,9311.602,9314.405,"I'm going to go ahead, and that was my next slide.",218,,
1326,0.97,9314.405,9318.008,I'll go ahead and move to the next slide.,218,,
1327,0.97,9318.008,9323.847,"As you can, I'm just going to go ahead and skip to these bottom two bullets.",218,,
1328,0.97,9323.847,9334.491,"As you can see, SPD is projecting that they're going to hire seven new recruits per month.",218,,
1329,0.97,9334.491,9335.359,That's the assumption there.,218,,
1330,0.97,9335.359,9337.161,We can send seven recruits per month.,218,,
1331,0.97,9337.161,9345.602,"We can send more if they have availability, but seven is what we can send if they're Maxed out otherwise.",218,,
1332,0.97,9345.602,9356.38,"We are going to, the Department believes it's going to bring in five Lateral higher hires and two Rehires.",218,,
1333,0.97,9356.38,9364.455,The bottle neck for hiring has always been Backgrounding process.,218,,
1334,0.97,9364.455,9389.646,"It has been, the challenge has always been that you get a whole lot of folks in through the front end at the testing process, and then when they hit the Backgrounding process, it's such a time intensive exercise to go into interviewing their family and friends.",218,,
1335,0.97,9389.646,9390.681,It takes so much time.,218,,
1336,0.97,9390.681,9393.484,That's where things really start to slow down.,218,,
1337,0.97,9393.484,9404.695,"So SPD, as you'll see in the package that they're going to describe in a few minutes using salary savings is changing that.",218,,
1338,0.97,9404.695,9414.138,"They are going to hire, or they started hiring with a third party service to expedite that piece of it.",218,,
1339,0.97,9414.138,9421.645,They have also on the front end moved to electronic testing.,218,,
1340,0.97,9421.645,9436.126,"One thing I can say is, this particular go around when the Department is predicting more hires, they're doing so with a change in practice.",218,,
1341,0.97,9436.126,9448.272,"When the Department has more hires in the past, they've predicted more hires, but they haven't really changed anything in terms of new recruits.",218,,
1342,0.97,9448.272,9452.376,Now they've changed some things pretty significantly.,218,,
1343,0.97,9452.376,9457.448,So that is worth noting.,218,,
1344,0.97,9457.448,9460.684,When it comes to separations I can't speak to that.,218,,
1345,0.97,9460.684,9464.822,I'll let Dr. Fisher speak to that.,218,,
1346,0.97,9464.822,9472.93,"It may be optimistic, but I'll pass it over to him and let him take a run.",218,,
1347,0.97,9472.93,9473.33,Thanks Greg.,219,,
1348,0.97,9473.33,9483.44,"Angela can weigh in as, as she does a lot of the ground work.",219,,
1349,0.97,9483.44,9495.786,"Tracking month by month, slowed down from the highs, specifically in resignations while retirements have maintained at a higher rate.",219,,
1350,0.97,9495.786,9506.897,"I think Angela can speak, coming through June, knowing how many retirements we've had, looking at the slow down in early resignations and knowing how the years play out.",219,,
1351,0.97,9506.897,9515.072,"Angela, if you want to jump in on why they feel retirements may also slow down.",219,,
1352,0.97,9515.072,9527.184,"Setting aside 2020, we typically see about 65% of our separations occur through June.",220,,
1353,0.97,9527.184,9531.188,There is a benefit that Incentivizes kind of that particular departure date.,220,,
1354,0.97,9531.188,9567.257,"So typically we see the first six months about 65% and factor that into the projections here again, 2020 was a bit of an anomaly, where we saw the majority of our separations late in the year, just based on the month to month separations for 2021, we are seeing, I wouldn't say a return to historical levels, but we are seeing fewer separations recorded at least in the recent months, but consistency with that June peak.",220,,
1355,0.97,9567.257,9583.106,"And I would note, while the trend is I guess, a reason for some optimism, it still puts us at I believe our second highest year ever of losses.",221,,
1356,0.97,9583.106,9588.712,"Not as horrible of a story as last year, but also not still great news.",221,,
1357,0.97,9588.712,9594.818,Just to finish the recording on the 38 that came in.,222,,
1358,0.97,9594.818,9601.291,"13 of the 38 were people of color, and 7 were women.",222,,
1359,0.97,9601.291,9611.802,So that's consistent with what the recent Academy classes have been with a higher percent of people of color and of women.,222,,
1360,0.97,9611.802,9643.8,"But still, even with the 34 that have come in, and with the projected numbers that are to come in at the end of the year, if you analyze the staffing plan, and take a look at the entire year, what you see is the numbers before you in this table and it all works out to sort of a headline that there would be about $15.3 million salary savings in 2021.",222,,
1361,0.97,9643.8,9649.139,That $15.3 million is of course an estimate.,222,,
1362,0.97,9649.139,9665.222,"If the Department were to separate more than the 60 that are projected for separation between June and December, then there would be more savings available.",222,,
1363,0.97,9665.222,9672.429,And it's just a matter of waiting to see how that works out.,222,,
1364,0.97,9672.429,9682.105,"And so with that, I am going to go ahead and move onto precinct staffing.",222,,
1365,0.97,9682.105,9683.507,One quick additional question.,223,,
1366,0.97,9683.507,9701.324,"Angela, you mentioned some data as it relates to separations as far as the length of employment term, and their demographics.",223,,
1367,0.97,9701.324,9703.627,I do remember seeing that information in prior reports.,223,,
1368,0.97,9703.627,9707.864,I did not see that included in the most recent reports.,223,,
1369,0.97,9707.864,9712.469,I trust that you're still collecting that information.,223,,
1370,0.97,9712.469,9717.774,And I do see the demographic information coming in on the new hires.,223,,
1371,0.97,9717.774,9723.847,I don't recall seeing it on the separations.,223,,
1372,0.97,9723.847,9733.557,"We are still tracking that on separations, if that's something that would be helpful to share.",224,,
1373,0.97,9733.557,9735.058,But we are tracking that.,224,,
1374,0.97,9735.058,9736.993,Thank you.,225,,
1375,0.97,9736.993,9741.531,I would definitely like to see that.,225,,
1376,0.97,9741.531,9746.136,Dr. Fisher mentioned we are still seeing a lot of separations from new hires.,225,,
1377,0.97,9746.136,9769.292,"My recommendation from last year is the separations were spread among, just questioning to see any specific trends associated with the separations as well.",225,,
1378,0.97,9769.292,9773.63,Thank you.,225,,
1379,0.97,9773.63,9778.802,Councilmember Mosqueda has a question.,226,,
1380,0.97,9778.802,9779.369,Thank you.,227,,
1381,0.97,9779.369,9785.876,"I also see Councilmember Pedersen, so I'll make mine very quick.",227,,
1382,0.97,9785.876,9787.344,"Just on this, so two questions.",227,,
1383,0.97,9787.344,9792.282,One is do we have any indication of where the officers are being hired from?,227,,
1384,0.97,9792.282,9799.823,Are these previous officers Úthat were in other areas that we're recruiting over.,227,,
1385,0.97,9799.823,9802.359,Are they officers left on their own?,227,,
1386,0.97,9802.359,9833.256,"And my second question is, just to remind us all, isn't it correct that last year's budget included the full hiring plan that could be reasonably achieved that the Mayor requested that We.Included in our budget, just to make sure that everybody could you confirm that as well for us, Greg?",227,,
1387,0.97,9833.256,9834.424,"Thank you, Councilmember.",228,,
1388,0.97,9834.424,9850.006,"I can confirm that the number of hires, the 114 hires that SPD had projected were fully funded in the proposed budget.",228,,
1389,0.97,9850.006,9861.585,"There was some discussion about how many people would separate, and that was a number that went under some analysis, but the number of hires was fully funded.",228,,
1390,0.97,9861.585,9863.954,Yes.,228,,
1391,0.97,9863.954,9865.355,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",229,,
1392,0.97,9865.355,9873.396,"Sorry, that first question might have been for SPD in terms of where they came from.",230,,
1393,0.97,9873.396,9873.797,I'm sorry.,231,,
1394,0.97,9873.797,9878.602,I thought that was a request for them to provide information in the future.,231,,
1395,0.97,9878.602,9882.706,I don't know that we have that right now.,231,,
1396,0.97,9882.706,9883.54,But correct me.,231,,
1397,0.97,9883.54,9885.609,I can give a general sense.,232,,
1398,0.97,9885.609,9886.643,I'm happy to send the numbers.,232,,
1399,0.97,9886.643,9890.347,I think we've had a very low number of Laterals.,232,,
1400,0.97,9890.347,9898.855,"I think that there's a recruitment saying of it's hard to get people to move from an agency, when people are leaving an agency.",232,,
1401,0.97,9898.855,9913.837,"So not a whole lot of folks who are police officers currently elsewhere, and we've had maybe five or less, I think officers who had left asked to come back.",232,,
1402,0.97,9913.837,9920.477,I don't know how many of those successfully.,232,,
1403,0.97,9920.477,9920.977,Obviously we reassess.,232,,
1404,0.97,9920.977,9935.325,"But the chief has been very straight forward, that if folks realize, to use another turn of phrase, the grass was not greener, they're welcome back.",232,,
1405,0.97,9935.325,9942.699,But if we can get the breakdown of the background of the folks we have hired.,232,,
1406,0.97,9942.699,9960.684,"Before turning it over to Councilmember Pedersen for another question on this slide, I just want to say that despite the point that Council fully funded SPD's 2021 staffing plan, it is self-evident that officers are still leaving the Department in unprecedented numbers.",233,,
1407,0.97,9960.684,9992.816,"I just want to take this moment to thank those who are remaining and committed to law enforcement, public service in Seattle, and hope folks who want to continue in serving in this role as a public servant consider continuing to do so, really appreciative that you are expressing your commitment to the city, and to this community by staying with us.",233,,
1408,0.97,9992.816,9993.116,Thank you.,233,,
1409,0.97,9993.116,9993.616,Councilmember Pedersen.,233,,
1410,0.97,9993.616,9994.284,"Thank you, chair.",234,,
1411,0.97,9994.284,9996.519,I really appreciate those remarks you just made.,234,,
1412,0.97,9996.519,10011.234,"I know at least based on the anecdotal, for officers to hear that is really important that some city council members want them to stay.",234,,
1413,0.97,10011.234,10023.78,And I had a question about the 15 million in savings is that a gross number?,234,,
1414,0.97,10023.78,10027.784,Because wouldn't there need to be more spent to back fill patrol positions?,234,,
1415,0.97,10027.784,10035.425,"And I know, for example in the North Precinct, we don't have our community police officers anymore, because they've been moved to patrol.",234,,
1416,0.97,10035.425,10046.403,"So just wondering if that's a gross number 15 million, it would not be net savings if we had to increase overtime to back fill.",234,,
1417,0.97,10046.403,10052.008,Councilmember that is a gross number.,235,,
1418,0.97,10052.008,10053.41,That is just salary savings in isolation.,235,,
1419,0.97,10053.41,10070.794,"I think you will see in a moment, when SPD presents its plan for those salary savings that one of the elements of their plan is to Repurpose some of the salary savings for overtime.",235,,
1420,0.97,10070.794,10079.068,So that would address the statement you're making.,235,,
1421,0.97,10079.068,10079.869,Thanks Councilmember Pedersen.,236,,
1422,0.97,10079.869,10083.74,I just want to note that we are on slide 12.,236,,
1423,0.97,10083.74,10089.446,I believe we have 28 total slides to cover.,236,,
1424,0.97,10089.446,10089.913,Councilmember Lewis.,236,,
1425,0.97,10089.913,10108.064,"I just wanted to jump in for a second while we're still on the officer wellness question, and appreciate the comments that you made about encouraging officers of the dedication to stay in the city and work with us.",237,,
1426,0.97,10108.064,10128.718,"I want to make sure those sentiments don't get lost in the shuffle of what I think is connected to officer wellness, which is the ongoing project to make sure that we continue to develop and stand up a response so that patrol officers do not have to respond to the same volume of calls that they're currently expected to respond to.",237,,
1427,0.97,10128.718,10148.338,"I would like as we go forward, and I know Spb is doing this, as we have more hearings on the topics of Transitioning things to triage one, or health one, or some kind of Cahoot style community based platform, that those also be seen in the context of what are SPD staffing strategy is.",237,,
1428,0.97,10148.338,10194.517,"I did just want to make that known, because I do think that it's become evident, and there's agreement between us and the Department there's a very significant portion of calls that can go to different services, and that as implications here for this discussion, and has implications too for officer wellness, and giving more clarity to their mission, and just making sure that I just waned to raise that context, there's going to be a lot more first response services that are going to be stud up in some cases responding to calls that we currently depend on for patrol, so I wanted to make that point really quickly.",237,,
1429,0.97,10194.517,10196.286,Very helpful.,238,,
1430,0.97,10196.286,10200.99,Thank you for weaving those concepts together.,238,,
1431,0.97,10200.99,10217.14,I really appreciate the recognition that part of having a reasonable expectation for our workforce is going to be standing up alternative so that we are certain that sworn officers are responding to calls that only they can respond to.,238,,
1432,0.97,10217.14,10218.308,So thank you.,238,,
1433,0.97,10218.308,10218.841,All right.,239,,
1434,0.97,10218.841,10222.645,I'm going to pick up the pace a little.,239,,
1435,0.97,10222.645,10223.98,"Madam chair, given your Cue.",239,,
1436,0.97,10223.98,10225.648,"I'm sorry, Greg.",240,,
1437,0.97,10225.648,10230.286,Can I just pop in really quickly here?,240,,
1438,0.97,10230.286,10231.554,I'm so sorry.,240,,
1439,0.97,10231.554,10232.021,"No, that's okay.",240,,
1440,0.97,10232.021,10238.027,"I didn't raise my hand, and I'm at disadvantage here, because I don't have my Video on.",240,,
1441,0.97,10238.027,10241.297,We're at home taking care of a sick toddler.,240,,
1442,0.97,10241.297,10243.833,So I appreciate the patience.,240,,
1443,0.97,10243.833,10247.604,Just a quick question here.,240,,
1444,0.97,10247.604,10254.644,And this is for SPD staff not for Greg.,240,,
1445,0.97,10254.644,10280.77,"I think when we hear about SPD staffing issues, and when SPD leadership is talking about SPD staffing issues to the media, what we continue to hear is that is sort of ringing of the alarm bells around hiring.",240,,
1446,0.97,10280.77,10293.75,What we don't necessarily hear about is the recruiting aspects of SPD's management responsibilities.,240,,
1447,0.97,10293.75,10322.578,"So knowing that SPD's hiring plan is fully funded for 2021, I am not hearing a lot of strategies from SPD about the recruitment pieces of this conversation and I think that that is both unfortunate, and a missed opportunity to have a conversation about recruitment that' where I'm seeing these numbers still a story.",240,,
1448,0.97,10322.578,10328.084,"How are we addressing things like current officer wellness, and well-being?",240,,
1449,0.97,10328.084,10366.789,"How are we addressing, how are we addressing staffing issues, Ie transfers from positions that are more favorable to positions that officers don't necessarily want to be doing, and addressing shift issues as well I don't see anything in this presentation, and maybe we're going to get to it a little bit later about Redramatic, recruitment, but strategies where I see the concerns existing around separations.",240,,
1450,0.97,10366.789,10394.15,And so I would like to hear from Dr. Fisher or anyone else from SPD on the line about sort of what specific strategies is the agency pursuing to address the issue of Retension of existing and new officers in light of these numbers related to separations?,240,,
1451,0.97,10394.15,10396.753,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez.",241,,
1452,0.97,10396.753,10400.59,Those are obviously two important areas we have been focusing on.,241,,
1453,0.97,10400.59,10410.7,We take our Cue from the I team's work that we did when we had our first Retension problem in 2018.,241,,
1454,0.97,10410.7,10414.303,And they came up with a lot of strategies.,241,,
1455,0.97,10414.303,10419.609,It was a cross sort of background team that the Mayor's office pulled together.,241,,
1456,0.97,10419.609,10430.219,"They talked to recruiting experts locally, and across the country, and came up with a variety of suggestive ways we could change our procedures.",241,,
1457,0.97,10430.219,10461.484,"Part of the constraints we've had is that with our staffing issues, we are not able to pull as many officers as we used Toment one of our biggest, most successful strategies had been sending officers who looked and connect to communities that we wanted more officers from to go, and speak and make connections and explain why SPD was a great place to work and to make change when we've lost --",241,,
1458,0.97,10461.484,10464.187,"Dr. Fisher, that's a recruitment strategy.",242,,
1459,0.97,10464.187,10466.022,Not a Retension strategy.,242,,
1460,0.97,10466.022,10467.757,I was going to get there.,243,,
1461,0.97,10467.757,10475.097,"I'm sorry Madam President, I thought you asked about both.",243,,
1462,0.97,10475.097,10475.331,No.,244,,
1463,0.97,10475.331,10480.002,"I am focusing in on Retension, which is where I see the issue.",244,,
1464,0.97,10480.002,10490.079,I think these numbers tell a story about how SPD has significant room for improvement.,244,,
1465,0.97,10490.079,10505.862,Management of SPD has significant room for improvement for retaining the officers and existing officers that have been hired or have continued to be an officer at SPD.,244,,
1466,0.97,10505.862,10506.262,Okay.,245,,
1467,0.97,10506.262,10516.772,"When we talk to our Recruiters who talk within the Department, because they want to know what we can do to tell a friend to come here.",245,,
1468,0.97,10516.772,10519.909,"There's a metric, I'm going to forget what it's called now.",245,,
1469,0.97,10519.909,10521.444,The net something score.,245,,
1470,0.97,10521.444,10522.612,A lot of corporations use it.,245,,
1471,0.97,10522.612,10539.462,"It's basically what percentage on a scale of negative 100 to positive 100, how strongly would you endorse a friend or family member coming to work where you work?",245,,
1472,0.97,10539.462,10540.429,Spd is negative 50.,245,,
1473,0.97,10540.429,10540.796,Which is bad.,245,,
1474,0.97,10540.796,10553.976,"When we talk to folks, I think one of the biggest things we can do is some of the stuff that just happened about 10 minutes ago, hearing from a broad selection of the city that they wants folks to stay here.",245,,
1475,0.97,10553.976,10556.746,They've heard it from the chief.,245,,
1476,0.97,10556.746,10559.982,"They've heard it at times from the community, from the press.",245,,
1477,0.97,10559.982,10573.029,But I think this was the first time in a while they've heard it from a broad section of electives.,245,,
1478,0.97,10573.029,10581.437,"Sorry, I'm getting a bit emotional, because a lot of these people I've built relationships with.",245,,
1479,0.97,10581.437,10599.989,"I know how much it hurt them to feel that they were, especially the younger ones, being told they might get laid off, and I think that was a message to maybe this wasn't a place to be a police officer.",245,,
1480,0.97,10599.989,10603.259,"And today, I appreciate everyone who spoke up.",245,,
1481,0.97,10603.259,10604.894,I think that means a lot.,245,,
1482,0.97,10604.894,10608.297,I do not think this is personal.,245,,
1483,0.97,10608.297,10612.668,I understand politics and how things get wrapped up.,245,,
1484,0.97,10612.668,10618.207,"But I can't pretend that it didn't factor into a lot of their decisions, and I don't know.",245,,
1485,0.97,10618.207,10625.781,"The Chiefhas done as much, I think as he can do to support and to show that he cares about them.",245,,
1486,0.97,10625.781,10627.516,That he recognizes their good work.,245,,
1487,0.97,10627.516,10631.153,"And I think, you know, there are other administrative things.",245,,
1488,0.97,10631.153,10635.191,"The schedule, and other things that I think help people want to stay.",245,,
1489,0.97,10635.191,10644.533,But so many of these folks came to serve and to help their community and I think they just want to feel that people see that.,245,,
1490,0.97,10644.533,10655.044,"I don't think any of indemnify think that people don't make mistakes or do horrible things, and those people should be held accountable, but most people don't ever do those things.",245,,
1491,0.97,10655.044,10663.319,I think they just want to feel that their service is recognized.,245,,
1492,0.97,10663.319,10671.327,"But in terms of strategies, we have talked about ways to get people to stay that we see other departments do.",245,,
1493,0.97,10671.327,10672.862,Some of these have fiscal costs.,245,,
1494,0.97,10672.862,10676.365,Some of them would probably have to be negotiated.,245,,
1495,0.97,10676.365,10682.538,Lots of places help cover tuition for classes for people to get advanced degrees.,245,,
1496,0.97,10682.538,10685.341,They help pay for gym memberships.,245,,
1497,0.97,10685.341,10693.282,"There are all sorts of those sort of benefits that aren't extra salary, but help people show that they're investing in you.",245,,
1498,0.97,10693.282,10694.55,They want you to professionally develop.,245,,
1499,0.97,10694.55,10699.055,They want you to take advantage of all the training that you can have access to.,245,,
1500,0.97,10699.055,10705.094,"And so, I mean, I think those are things we have talked about them.",245,,
1501,0.97,10705.094,10710.199,"Ways to legally do them with set UPS we have, both from contracts and Washington and Seattle law.",245,,
1502,0.97,10710.199,10714.804,"Not a lawyer, so I'm not going to try to get into that, but I've heard the conversations.",245,,
1503,0.97,10714.804,10734.79,"So we're very aware of how do we make it so it's the best place to work for the people who want to do the work, but what we've seen from borrowing from corporate culture is that people who were here need to want to be here to both attract new talent, and to get people to want to stay.",245,,
1504,0.97,10734.79,10741.697,"And no doubt, and chief Diaz will say it, some of it is on command.",245,,
1505,0.97,10741.697,10743.165,They want to see command more.,245,,
1506,0.97,10743.165,10744.767,They need their supervisor to be better.,245,,
1507,0.97,10744.767,10767.99,"We're doing a lot of work in our hr community with an amazing employee who is really focusing on Instilling a culture of an outward mindset, and a change mindset so people can understand how to grow and collaborate with each other and be open to change and see opportunities to better themselves while they're also bettering the Department.",245,,
1508,0.97,10767.99,10774.697,"There's a lot going on, I think if we need package it up, we can package it up.",245,,
1509,0.97,10774.697,10794.416,"But I think that the Department is trying to do what it has the ability to do, but has raised these ideas, and we need to have the conversations about can we Uncomplicate them.",245,,
1510,0.97,10794.416,10800.723,"So I didn't hear an answer to my question, and I'm really disappointed about that.",246,,
1511,0.97,10800.723,10806.729,"What I hear is, again, a lot of language on the hiring side.",246,,
1512,0.97,10806.729,10808.364,I'm not interested in politics.,246,,
1513,0.97,10808.364,10810.633,"I'm interested in actual policy solutions, because that's my job.",246,,
1514,0.97,10810.633,10830.052,"So I would like to get an understanding from command staff, what specific things, strategies, investments, interventions, other recommendations are being advanced to address the reality of recruitment.",246,,
1515,0.97,10830.052,10830.553,"I'm sorry, Retension.",246,,
1516,0.97,10830.553,10834.423,So that's really what I think the issue is here.,246,,
1517,0.97,10834.423,10840.729,Because we have fully funded Y'all to do the hiring that you need to do.,246,,
1518,0.97,10840.729,10867.556,"Where I'm seeing there continues to be a significant concern, and I think this is on management, is how do we retain officers that we have spent time hiring, that the Department is funded and green lit to be able to move toward with those hiring processes.",246,,
1519,0.97,10867.556,10878.667,"So I am not hearing about, you know, what the chief and command staff are doing as it results to actually retaining those individuals.",246,,
1520,0.97,10878.667,10893.983,"And there will be issues that I suspect will need to be addressed via the bargaining, and we are already in the midst of doing those particular operational fixes.",246,,
1521,0.97,10893.983,10914.603,"But I think that, you know, what I understand has happened from the interdepartmental work that you Referenced Dr. Fisher, that my office participated, and so did Council central staff is a lot of those recommendations have been left on the table, particularly last year, because of Covid, and because of the reality of needing to move forward.",246,,
1522,0.97,10914.603,10935.624,"So I feel that we have not, and by we, I mean the executive has not spend enough time addressing specifically the strategies related to how we are, how SPD's management is addressing the Retension issues related to SPD.",246,,
1523,0.97,10935.624,10937.059,Okay.,247,,
1524,0.97,10937.059,10939.361,I'll take another stab at it.,247,,
1525,0.97,10939.361,10954.51,"We, chief Betts kicked off, and chief Diaz has pushed forward on growing our wellness unit and recognizing that all the supports we can give to officers from both physical and mental wellness are essential to showing people they're valued.",247,,
1526,0.97,10954.51,10984.039,"We have been engaging in innovation blueprint with Accenture to figure out from hiring to technology, to Retension, to professional development, to culture, to community engagement with their BROADVIEW of policing and public agencies have learned and they have brought those to us and we're constructing that blueprint.",247,,
1527,0.97,10984.039,10985.174,We're investing where we can in facilities.,247,,
1528,0.97,10985.174,10988.377,The department has been told that in the past and been told no.,247,,
1529,0.97,10988.377,11007.329,"So again it often comes back to we can speak about things, but sometimes things involve investments, and we hear in this package that we may or may not get to, have some ideas where we can get to start to do that work.",247,,
1530,0.97,11007.329,11021.41,"The new BIS is shaping the science around how many bad things might shape, focused on quality and support and supervision to ensure that officers are the best they have.",247,,
1531,0.97,11021.41,11022.111,We talked to officers directly.,247,,
1532,0.97,11022.111,11027.383,What we hear is they want to know the Department cares about them and the city cares about them.,247,,
1533,0.97,11027.383,11040.796,"For many of them, they would say like more money helps, but if they wanted, if it was all about the paycheck there are other things they could be doing that would make just as much with a lot less time away from family.",247,,
1534,0.97,11040.796,11044.867,They ant to know that people are investing in them.,247,,
1535,0.97,11044.867,11047.97,Investing in the Department.,247,,
1536,0.97,11047.97,11048.57,That they have appreciated.,247,,
1537,0.97,11048.57,11058.414,"They've signed on, most of them for a 25 to 30 year commitment and they want some assurance that that is going to be honored.",247,,
1538,0.97,11058.414,11060.449,That's what we hear from them.,247,,
1539,0.97,11060.449,11061.35,That's what the team heard.,247,,
1540,0.97,11061.35,11066.088,"We're doing the 410 schedule, which is what we consistently have heard.",247,,
1541,0.97,11066.088,11077.933,"If there are other things in that Idt, or in the I team recommendations that Resonated with folks that have not been done, we can shake it off again.",247,,
1542,0.97,11077.933,11085.174,"But when this was first done, we were not losing a ton of folks.",247,,
1543,0.97,11085.174,11086.475,Anywhere near the level we lost.,247,,
1544,0.97,11086.475,11092.147,So I think we may have also seen a change in what the issue was from 2018 to 2020.,247,,
1545,0.97,11092.147,11096.385,So we probably need to Relook at that in another light.,247,,
1546,0.97,11096.385,11107.262,"Dr. Fisher, I think this is a Segway perhaps to move to the SPD's proposal.",248,,
1547,0.97,11107.262,11132.454,"I appreciate the work that's gone into these other slides, but in the interest of time, perhaps we could move forward in addressing and hearing some of those recommendations because I do believe that some of those recommendations relate to the work load, and some of the wellness issues.",248,,
1548,0.97,11132.454,11136.758,"And so with that, thank you, Greg, for advancing the slides.",248,,
1549,0.97,11136.758,11164.82,"And real quick, Madam chair, this first slide is sort of a list of things that would be proposed spending within SPD, and then it continues on to other proposed spending with the list totaling 15.2 million here, as you can see that the list is 15.3 million, which is the sum of the salary spending.",249,,
1550,0.97,11164.82,11168.657,I'm going to very quickly before I turn it over to Dr.,249,,
1551,0.97,11168.657,11178.867,"Fisher, to describe the list, say that SPD has begun spending on a number of these items as you know on separation pay and deferred COMP.",249,,
1552,0.97,11178.867,11194.216,"Some of these items, Madam chair, as you have suggested will need legal authority by moving dollars between DSL's, the Council will need to do that, either through the supplemental bill that is before you, or through another piece of legislation.",249,,
1553,0.97,11194.216,11200.722,It's my understanding there may be another piece of legislation coming to the committee within the next few weeks.,249,,
1554,0.97,11200.722,11207.095,There is a hiring incentive in here that cannot be done without legislation.,249,,
1555,0.97,11207.095,11215.904,"Chris will describe, Dr. Fisher will describe that hiring incentive, but it can't be done without passage of legislation that has been transmitted.",249,,
1556,0.97,11215.904,11224.913,"And then, Lastly, as I said before, the funding for the community safety investments must be moved to other Democratics.",249,,
1557,0.97,11224.913,11230.919,So all of these things would require legislative action.,249,,
1558,0.97,11230.919,11244.266,"Spd can do some of them themselves, mostly the ones on this page, but the budget chair and the Council will have to take action to do some of them and make them available to SPD from an authority standpoint.",249,,
1559,0.97,11244.266,11247.803,"So with that, I'll turn it over to SPD to describe the items.",249,,
1560,0.97,11247.803,11249.905,Thank you.,250,,
1561,0.97,11249.905,11251.006,"Thank you, Greg.",251,,
1562,0.97,11251.006,11256.211,"I'll kick off with some of these, then toss it over to Chris.",251,,
1563,0.97,11256.211,11262.651,As we go so your first item there is civilian support.,251,,
1564,0.97,11262.651,11272.06,This line item includes a number of positions.,251,,
1565,0.97,11272.06,11273.495,"Some of which are, thank you.",251,,
1566,0.97,11273.495,11275.43,The full list is included here.,251,,
1567,0.97,11275.43,11290.245,"Some of these were identified in January as being critical civilian positions that we were requesting funding for, in the 2021 budget process.",251,,
1568,0.97,11290.245,11308.33,"As you may recall, we cut $4 million in civilian salaries, as we continue to lose officers we identified that it would be easier to Onboard some of these civilian positions to help with the work load as we continue to lose swarm personnel.",251,,
1569,0.97,11308.33,11319.041,"Some of these are direct support positions to our emergency response function like the CSO's, like crime prevention coordinator.",251,,
1570,0.97,11319.041,11331.553,"Some provided administrative functions within the Department that are deemed critical like the public disclosure positions, eight of these are for dedicated public disclosure support.",251,,
1571,0.97,11331.553,11337.292,"We identified some of those earlier this year, the January memo.",251,,
1572,0.97,11337.292,11344.966,We have since added at the recommendation of law Department.,251,,
1573,0.97,11344.966,11350.939,"We've got an increase in public work load, I don't think there's an issue for any of you.",251,,
1574,0.97,11350.939,11362.884,"And from a risk stand point, we are wanting to pursue additional positions to address that growing work load.",251,,
1575,0.97,11362.884,11371.46,The Cid public safety liaison were also identified earlier this year in discussions around the legislation.,251,,
1576,0.97,11371.46,11379.401,"And the training coordinator, this item is a new position requested by chief Diaz.",251,,
1577,0.97,11379.401,11402.39,This is in support of a pilot program for relational training program meant to support and train community oriented compassionate police officers.,251,,
1578,0.97,11402.39,11409.498,Trying to give new hires the tools to mitigate impacts of the job.,251,,
1579,0.97,11409.498,11439.761,"This is highlighted in our, in the monitor, as an area that is a critical aspect of compliance so together factor in the Timelines for these positions we're looking at 1.2 million to these investments, if you want to hop back.",251,,
1580,0.97,11439.761,11443.532,A couple quick things.,252,,
1581,0.97,11443.532,11451.306,"Fr those who don't speak SPD budget, the basic law enforcement Academy.",252,,
1582,0.97,11451.306,11462.317,"That's the Academy, so the turning coordinator would be providing training to recruits before they went to Akazemi.",252,,
1583,0.97,11462.317,11465.187,"Normally recruits are hired, a understand sent right away.",252,,
1584,0.97,11465.187,11474.896,The thing Angela just described about when they're hired and they need positions.,252,,
1585,0.97,11474.896,11480.135,"At the very back of this presentation I'm going to Scroll, there is a table that describes what Angela went through.",252,,
1586,0.97,11480.135,11491.379,"If you have any questions or need to refer later to where these positions are, whether there's authority needed or where they are in the hiring process, that is all provided in the back of the table.",252,,
1587,0.97,11491.379,11498.386,"Not going into that detail now, but that's on the agenda on this presentation in case you needed it.",252,,
1588,0.97,11498.386,11506.461,And now I'm Scrolling back to the presentation.,252,,
1589,0.97,11506.461,11506.828,Thank you.,253,,
1590,0.97,11506.828,11516.104,"All right, up next, these next two items are tied directly to the Reimagining community safety work.",253,,
1591,0.97,11516.104,11520.242,"The additional community service officer unit, or squad.",253,,
1592,0.97,11520.242,11526.648,"We would like to start, we would like to expand the unit starting in November of this year.",253,,
1593,0.97,11526.648,11533.555,This was a recommendation that came out of the Idt to continue expanding that function.,253,,
1594,0.97,11533.555,11547.702,The CSS were added to bridge that service gap where police officers can't provide direct services or connect individuals contacted to services.,253,,
1595,0.97,11547.702,11551.706,This unit provides that exact function.,253,,
1596,0.97,11551.706,11560.348,It fits nicely into the city's work and an objective of expanding alternative response resources.,253,,
1597,0.97,11560.348,11563.351,The technology investments were also Previewed in January.,253,,
1598,0.97,11563.351,11573.828,We have since entered into a contract with Accenture that includes a number of items.,253,,
1599,0.97,11573.828,11576.831,The data Analytics Plat for upgrade and update.,253,,
1600,0.97,11576.831,11585.974,"The capacity planning tool, and the new early intervention system that we've Referenced a couple times today.",253,,
1601,0.97,11585.974,11590.645,Happy to answer or field any questions there.,253,,
1602,0.97,11590.645,11594.95,Where there is confusion about what those items are.,253,,
1603,0.97,11594.95,11597.686,"If not, I can move on.",253,,
1604,0.97,11597.686,11600.622,I see folks coming on screen.,254,,
1605,0.97,11600.622,11601.189,I see a hand up.,254,,
1606,0.97,11601.189,11601.656,Councilmember Lewis.,254,,
1607,0.97,11601.656,11607.662,I just want to jump in and talk a little about the CSO's.,255,,
1608,0.97,11607.662,11611.833,A huge fan of the work the CSO's are doing.,255,,
1609,0.97,11611.833,11617.605,Really proud of unit and the effectiveness of that unit.,255,,
1610,0.97,11617.605,11632.32,"In the medium term here, I do wonder operationally, now that we have some other departments where we can host services like this, that are Unsworn.",255,,
1611,0.97,11632.32,11638.059,Quasi uniformed I guess is how I would maybe describe the CSO's.,255,,
1612,0.97,11638.059,11642.931,What their future might look like in terms of potentially moving them to a different Department.,255,,
1613,0.97,11642.931,11661.282,"I imagine they could still have their sort of referral function of an officer responding to a call, seeing that the call probably doesn't require a criminal legal system intervention and then flagging a CSO, clearing the call, and moving on.",255,,
1614,0.97,11661.282,11668.056,I could see that still happening with the CSO's being in a different Department.,255,,
1615,0.97,11668.056,11679.034,And apparently having their community credibility in some circumstances increased by having it done that way rather than still being integrated within the Department.,255,,
1616,0.97,11679.034,11704.359,I just wonder if there's any thought about what a Timeline or expectation might be in potentially moving the CSO's to the public safety Department or one of the other places within the city where that unit might be able to eventually move?,255,,
1617,0.97,11704.359,11707.829,I can take this one.,256,,
1618,0.97,11707.829,11720.308,So I would say that the Department's preference in this situation would be to retain the community service officers.,256,,
1619,0.97,11720.308,11734.856,"The police are going to continue to be dispatched to situations that may, when the initial call comes in, seemingly call for police response.",256,,
1620,0.97,11734.856,11746.401,The CSO's were really meant to work as a Handoff from police officers to other community service providers.,256,,
1621,0.97,11746.401,11750.638,They're not in and of themselves direct service providers.,256,,
1622,0.97,11750.638,11761.783,We also through our community engagement heard from folks that there was an interest in having a function like community officers reside in the police Department.,256,,
1623,0.97,11761.783,11773.294,"Happy to share that engagement report with you, Councilmember, and to dive into that a little bit more if you're interested.",256,,
1624,0.97,11773.294,11789.077,"But I think it's important to just recognize that the partnership with, between patrol officers and community officers I think is largely what makes that successful.",256,,
1625,0.97,11789.077,11795.283,I'll just throw that out there right now.,257,,
1626,0.97,11795.283,11795.583,Thank you.,257,,
1627,0.97,11795.583,11799.053,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",258,,
1628,0.97,11799.053,11800.655,"Thank you, Madam chair.",259,,
1629,0.97,11800.655,11808.963,"I have two questions, but I will just start with one in difference to the other Councilmembers on the committee.",259,,
1630,0.97,11808.963,11814.235,The DOJ report says earlier intervention system is broken.,259,,
1631,0.97,11814.235,11828.983,"We find systemic deficiencies in SPD's earlier system which is designed to identify employees who may be experiencing symptoms of stress, training deficiencies or personal problems that may affect performance, noting there has to be seven uses of force within a six month period.",259,,
1632,0.97,11828.983,11835.323,Can you tell me if this is the same EIS system that you are now talking about funding?,259,,
1633,0.97,11835.323,11844.566,"Did I understand you correctly, that you've already started to contract with an Enty for the data Analytics platform?",259,,
1634,0.97,11844.566,11850.538,And does that also include moving forward with this EIS system?,259,,
1635,0.97,11850.538,11856.911,"It's my understanding, and we'll let SPD respond, because I know they're much more well versed.",260,,
1636,0.97,11856.911,11865.253,This is a different model in recognition that the old system was not particularly Affective.,260,,
1637,0.97,11865.253,11877.198,That it's more based on a wellness model using past trauma events as an Indicater.,260,,
1638,0.97,11877.198,11885.673,"But I am also interested around the cost, what portion of this are we talking about for this early intervention system?",260,,
1639,0.97,11885.673,11896.951,"I believe we were told back in May it would be 300,000.",260,,
1640,0.97,11896.951,11898.052,"Right, okay.",261,,
1641,0.97,11898.052,11898.253,Yes.,261,,
1642,0.97,11898.253,11915.536,"The current EIS system we always sort of knew, because there's research out there, EIS really started with the city of Miami, and then it spread, based on recommendations of both the civil rights Commission, and the Christopher Commission in L.A.",261,,
1643,0.97,11915.536,11917.472,It became a big push.,261,,
1644,0.97,11917.472,11923.011,"New Orleans under consent decree started to develop them, as did SPD.",261,,
1645,0.97,11923.011,11936.291,"They were all generally the model taking performance Metrics that may be early warning signs was the hope of impending excessive use of force, for example.",261,,
1646,0.97,11936.291,11937.692,They also look at community complaints.,261,,
1647,0.97,11937.692,11950.305,"But what most of these systems did not do was to consider the broader scope of the officers employment, where they work, how long have they been working, shifts that they're on.",261,,
1648,0.97,11950.305,11960.348,"The type of calls they're dispatched to, and that's just and that at this point would even be an old approach.",261,,
1649,0.97,11960.348,11964.752,So we engaged local researchers at Washington state.,261,,
1650,0.97,11964.752,11979.567,"Leaders in understanding performance, and performance measurement, and effects of stress and other wellness issues on performance to see if those apply to the EIS system that was approved to the consent decree.",261,,
1651,0.97,11979.567,11982.704,"To no surprise they found the same thing, it's the same model.",261,,
1652,0.97,11982.704,12010.698,"So ever since that, we have been in conversations with experts in the field and SPD, how we would take advantage of the data platform that was built in order to apply the stitched together data that were in desperate systems across the Department to be able to say what percentage of 911 calls result in a use of force.",261,,
1653,0.97,12010.698,12014.369,Something we could not have done in the past.,261,,
1654,0.97,12014.369,12017.805,"We use those all together, and it allows us to do that.",261,,
1655,0.97,12017.805,12021.743,Now recognizing that we need to do more.,261,,
1656,0.97,12021.743,12067.155,"And to do an advance Analytics that would allow us to truly highlight that someone is Trending towards maybe a high stress event, or that before we start to see those negative performance complaints that would have been used in the old model to say something really bad might happen, we're trying to use advanced Analytics to go more upstream and to understand how can we help officers before we get to things that the research has shown are not actually that predictive, because you don't have enough context around what environment they're happening in for the Department of the officer.",261,,
1657,0.97,12067.155,12078.032,"I think we can break out the specific cost, but to do that, that model of EIS, we also have to change how the Dap is scheduled.",261,,
1658,0.97,12078.032,12091.279,"Moving that into the cloud allows us to take more efficient advantage, both from a cost and analyst analytic standpoint.",261,,
1659,0.97,12091.279,12095.917,You're able to not have to have everything queued up all the time.,261,,
1660,0.97,12095.917,12107.762,"That you can run the data when you need to run it without paying to have it always constantly available, and constantly running.",261,,
1661,0.97,12107.762,12128.015,"The type of Analystics we're Analytics, we're thing about the transcript of body worn Video, if there are issues to be worked out there, but there's where we're going, in terms of how the officer is doing, what's going on in their experience, so we can highlight to a supervisor now is the time to engage that person.",261,,
1662,0.97,12128.015,12137.425,Nothing bad has happened yet on any level.,261,,
1663,0.97,12137.425,12143.297,"But they're Kitly showing early warning signs of moving in that direction, now is the time to coach, engage, and support.",261,,
1664,0.97,12143.297,12156.911,"So we can break out those costs, but they are intertwined, because we can't have EIS without a more Advantaged Dap, and inherently, the Dap has to keep getting improved.",261,,
1665,0.97,12156.911,12159.247,We have to advance with the technology.,261,,
1666,0.97,12159.247,12188.142,"I think all local governments suffer from that debt issue of paying for a good project and then it's harder to pay in between, I think this is us to say rather than waiting until we build a true Dap 5.0, let's thing about how we're Reimagining policing, we're going to need new tools and Analytics.",261,,
1667,0.97,12188.142,12197.151,One of the things the Dap work will do is allow us to look at where are officers spending time?,261,,
1668,0.97,12197.151,12204.725,And can we start to think about Over-Under policing are respect to the reporting of crime in an area.,261,,
1669,0.97,12204.725,12216.704,"There are things that we need to make the Dap a better tool, and that will make the EIS more realistic, and more capable.",261,,
1670,0.97,12216.704,12217.772,We have started that work.,261,,
1671,0.97,12217.772,12223.277,I think Angela explained with the budget that was already allowed to be spent.,261,,
1672,0.97,12223.277,12233.287,"But we're also, there's more work to be done, and that's where these proposals come in, and making sure we can finish this work and having these tools available.",261,,
1673,0.97,12233.287,12238.326,"Angela, did I Misspeak on the budget stuff?",261,,
1674,0.97,12238.326,12265.486,"No, I'll just add that as far as the budget goes that 2.25 million, we have entered into a contract with Accenture earlier this year with plans to use available salary savings consisted with the adopted budget, which a portion of the salary savings is we are restricted from spending those funds.",262,,
1675,0.97,12265.486,12269.657,There are some unrestricted funds that still exist within SPD's budget.,262,,
1676,0.97,12269.657,12279.333,"Madam chair I accidentally hit my keyboard, and my Windowed switched over and your clerk caught it very quickly, and switched me off.",263,,
1677,0.97,12279.333,12291.312,"If he will switch me back on, I'd be happy to put the table back on and apologize to the committee that I did that.",263,,
1678,0.97,12291.312,12292.113,Thank you.,264,,
1679,0.97,12292.113,12301.188,"So this I think gets to, first I want to say I am interested in these investments.",264,,
1680,0.97,12301.188,12321.709,"But I am still struggling as I mentioned earlier, with the fact that you have, one, these investments were not included in the Mayor's proposed 2021 budget so the Council did not have the opportunity to consider them.",264,,
1681,0.97,12321.709,12336.19,"And two, indications are that you're moving forward with these investments using salary Sakings in the patrol DSL that has not been transferred over for this purpose.",264,,
1682,0.97,12336.19,12339.96,"So again, I want to flag, that's a concern.",264,,
1683,0.97,12339.96,12360.448,I believe that's not an accepted budget practice for the Department to be Incumbering obligations prior to the Council authorization of the spending.,264,,
1684,0.97,12360.448,12370.858,"I thought there might be a response from SPD, but seeing none, Councilmember Morales.",264,,
1685,0.97,12370.858,12371.225,Thank you.,265,,
1686,0.97,12371.225,12404.291,"I want to get to this chart eventually, but I first want to say, I understand going back to what Councilmember Lewis was asking about the CSO's, I understand that SPD would prefer to keep them in the Department but we are in the process of Transitioning and Reimagining what public safety looks like, and really trying to center community and Community-Led strategies.",265,,
1687,0.97,12404.291,12416.37,"As we have heard from the Department itself, many officers feel there is a lot of work that could be transferred out, and I think the kind of work the CSO's do is an example.",265,,
1688,0.97,12416.37,12421.976,"Not the sworn officers themselves, but an example of the other kinds of work that could be transferred out.",265,,
1689,0.97,12421.976,12443.397,"So I would be interested in, you know, delaying a vote on that particular piece until we have a more in-depth conversation about whether the cs O's can go to the new community safety division communications center.",265,,
1690,0.97,12443.397,12465.82,"Getting to the capacity planning tool, and this is sort of in keeping with the same question, if it's meant to support 911 dispatch, I'm interested in staying with the 911 call center.",265,,
1691,0.97,12465.82,12496.75,"I think what my sort of Overarching question, and it gets to some of the technology questions too is how much is paid out, and whether or not they've been authorized by the counsel, and how much is that believed to be possibly reallocated, because I think we're struggling is this question of, what is already, what is required.",265,,
1692,0.97,12496.75,12502.189,"We know have we to do separation pay, we know we have to do family leave.",265,,
1693,0.97,12502.189,12508.762,What other acts do they require the Council to consider to pass something?,265,,
1694,0.97,12508.762,12511.999,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",266,,
1695,0.97,12511.999,12514.535,I'll do the C PT.,266,,
1696,0.97,12514.535,12534.388,"So the planning tool, which is part of the innovation blueprint, is part of the current tool we're using managing performance was too cumbersome, too slow, and really only focused on patrol officer staffing and deployment.",266,,
1697,0.97,12534.388,12551.839,"So somewhere, I don't know where along the lines, I don't know if it's how we wrote something or stacked items, but Cpt has nothing really to do with the 911 center.",266,,
1698,0.97,12551.839,12605.492,"It's about when you look at the work load of the patrol, it's a tool that allow us to say if you take this much time, this many of them a year, and this is your staffing model, how many folks do they need to fit that . You get trained into how it's doing its calculations they were not clear . It's part of the work going forward around Reimagining, as we identified calls that don't need to be responded to by an armed officer.",266,,
1699,0.97,12605.492,12619.106,"We can see what would off loading that call look like due to how many officers we would need given that we have heard consistently from community, folks want to know their officer.",266,,
1700,0.97,12619.106,12621.475,We have heard a lot about foot patrols.,266,,
1701,0.97,12621.475,12623.877,They want to see officers walking and talking to them.,266,,
1702,0.97,12623.877,12629.083,"That sort of deployment model, you can also layer that in to the Cpt program.",266,,
1703,0.97,12629.083,12650.638,"So it's really, I think maybe how it got connected to 911 was, it helps us look at the work flow coming in from 911, and tells us that the how many, what time, and what day, and each precinct by each sector can be from the officers do we need to effectively handle that work load with performance targets.",266,,
1704,0.97,12650.638,12678.332,"It does that in a much more sort of user friendly adaptable quicker way, but what it does above MPP is you can do with other parts of the Department, but you can say if we think we're going to start spending more time investigating X parts of a theft, how many detectives would we need if we're hoping to solve X percent of those.",266,,
1705,0.97,12678.332,12710.13,"So it allow us to do that capacity planning work, instead of just on a dispatch, the MPP program is really sort of modeled after a call Queuing model, and the Cpp program is much more adaptable, and Compensable about how many people do you need to do different types of work, where the tasks that work are different than just responding Úto essence, a work order.",266,,
1706,0.97,12710.13,12712.9,"That's why Cpd, how it got connected to 911.",266,,
1707,0.97,12712.9,12714.868,But it wouldn't help the 911 center.,266,,
1708,0.97,12714.868,12722.409,I don't actually know if it can help you figure out how many staff you need to do the call center.,266,,
1709,0.97,12722.409,12734.088,"We'd be happy to work with CCC on that, but it's really how many officers you would need to do the functions within the Department.",266,,
1710,0.97,12734.088,12746.967,"Before Angela takes the rest of the question, Councilmember, if that satisfies the one piece, I just want to provide a little bit of overview on the spending component, if I may.",267,,
1711,0.97,12746.967,12763.684,"That's to say that the title of this slide, executive salary, savings proposal is something I wrote, but I should add a little clarity here.",267,,
1712,0.97,12763.684,12791.512,"Many of the civilian positions that that are in that first line are positions that the Department already had authority for, and we're holding vacant, and were doing so at the request of the Mayor, and it is within their per view to be able to use salary savings to be able to fill those positions.",267,,
1713,0.97,12791.512,12797.651,The same is also true of things like the National Institute for criminal justice reform contract.,267,,
1714,0.97,12797.651,12809.53,That is within the Department's per view to be able to spend that money if they have the budget for it they can do it.,267,,
1715,0.97,12809.53,12819.273,"In terms of salary savings, they may not have the salary savings, but if they have the budget authority for it, they can enter into a contract for it.",267,,
1716,0.97,12819.273,12835.455,"So in terms of this being a proposal, I should provide a little context and say that the Department does have the authority to do many of these things already.",267,,
1717,0.97,12835.455,12835.923,The separation pay.,267,,
1718,0.97,12835.923,12843.73,"The money is already in the line for the officers and moving it to, they don't have to move it anywhere.",267,,
1719,0.97,12843.73,12856.51,"So with that as context, I turn it over to Angela to let her talk about what might be spent and where.",267,,
1720,0.97,12856.51,12861.181,"Hi, I'm going to get in.",268,,
1721,0.97,12861.181,12863.283,"Thank you, Greg.",269,,
1722,0.97,12863.283,12869.656,"I'll run quickly through these items, and indicate if we've already incurred expansions or not.",269,,
1723,0.97,12869.656,12888.742,"The civilian support, because it includes varying stages of the hiring process or filled, I'll refer everyone to the final two pages of this slide deck to see where we're at and process.",269,,
1724,0.97,12888.742,12892.212,We haven't incurred any expenses related to that position.,269,,
1725,0.97,12892.212,12892.713,No expenses.,269,,
1726,0.97,12892.713,12896.216,We have not hired the CSO unit.,269,,
1727,0.97,12896.216,12903.79,We have incurred costs related to the technology investments which you saw in our spending report in the earlier slides.,269,,
1728,0.97,12903.79,12911.231,"Nothing has been incurred, related to the work scheduling time period, since it was put on hold.",269,,
1729,0.97,12911.231,12915.903,Although that is set to resume within the next few weeks.,269,,
1730,0.97,12915.903,12923.043,We have incurred costs related to the National Institute for criminal justice reform contract.,269,,
1731,0.97,12923.043,12937.824,The results of which were reported in our final Ibt Reportment the mental health program and contract background services are also contract costs.,269,,
1732,0.97,12937.824,12940.027,Those contracts have been signed.,269,,
1733,0.97,12940.027,12948.468,"The contract amounts likely Incumbered, although I don't know if we've incurred any expenses to date.",269,,
1734,0.97,12948.468,12954.007,This is an estimate for the budget overage for the entirety of the year.,269,,
1735,0.97,12954.007,12961.114,That full amount has not been realized but will likely be realized by December.,269,,
1736,0.97,12961.114,12971.158,"If we go over 160 separations, that number will likely increase the budget short fall.",269,,
1737,0.97,12971.158,12974.995,"Deferred compensation, also an estimate.",269,,
1738,0.97,12974.995,12978.632,That is a full year projection as well.,269,,
1739,0.97,12978.632,12997.884,"Year to date, I believe we've incurred about a million dollars in expansions related to special events Oh with the sporting events that are set, over the next six months, we've developed this estimate just as a total annual overage.",269,,
1740,0.97,12997.884,13006.026,"Pay parental leave, we have incurred, I believe about a million dollars here year to date.",269,,
1741,0.97,13006.026,13021.575,"We do have plans to submit a request for an Appropriatation for the general fund amount if needed, if we're able to proceed without that appropriation, that decision will be made later this year.",269,,
1742,0.97,13021.575,13034.921,"The potential Covid related compensation adjustments has not been incurred, and neither have the hiring and Retension.",269,,
1743,0.97,13034.921,13048.001,"Thank you, Angela, it's very helpful.",270,,
1744,0.97,13048.001,13052.606,"Greg, did you want me to comment on the executive items?",271,,
1745,0.97,13052.606,13059.579,I think this is something that probably we can just hit really quick.,272,,
1746,0.97,13059.579,13069.556,This is something that got pretty covered pretty in-depth at the last public safety meeting.,272,,
1747,0.97,13069.556,13071.992,Just at a really high level.,272,,
1748,0.97,13071.992,13080.133,"Triage 1, $700,000 is the amount that the executive identified that would need to go into the fire Department.",272,,
1749,0.97,13080.133,13104.024,"To my knowledge the executive had not identified a funding source for that triage one until the letter that you all had sent to central staff, and the same being true of the dispatch protocol system, and the regional safety plan Peacekeepers collective.",272,,
1750,0.97,13104.024,13114.234,"Those amounts would need to be transferred, cut from SPD's budget and sent to these other departments.",272,,
1751,0.97,13114.234,13122.542,I NOTE here that the Sfd is the executives proposed plan for triage one.,272,,
1752,0.97,13122.542,13133.62,That's where the money would have to go if it went to the way that executive had proposed it.,272,,
1753,0.97,13133.62,13140.127,Councilmembers also might consider the Cscc per the conversation that's been going on for the last hour and a half.,272,,
1754,0.97,13140.127,13160.313,"With that, I don't know there's too much more to say about these particular investments, but certainly, Councilmembers may have answers for you all.",272,,
1755,0.97,13160.313,13166.386,"The one thing I would note, that is an important part.",272,,
1756,0.97,13166.386,13178.698,"There are Provisos that are in place for Provisos specifically, a salary savings for 5 million.",272,,
1757,0.97,13178.698,13202.355,And a harbor patrol proviso for 550 that would need to be removed before the Department could effect slate Effectump Affectuate.,272,,
1758,0.97,13202.355,13222.976,"That's an important point for counsel to understand is that to authorize this plan, that SPD is putting before you, you would need legislation that would make some of the appropriations moving around money, sometimes within SPD.",272,,
1759,0.97,13222.976,13234.287,"Sometimes out of SPD, but also to move the Provisos so SPD would be able to spend the money on its own items.",272,,
1760,0.97,13234.287,13238.291,"With that, I would ask if there's any questions for me or the Department.",272,,
1761,0.97,13238.291,13241.628,I'm hoping we can wrap this up.,273,,
1762,0.97,13241.628,13243.597,It is 1:12 P.M.,273,,
1763,0.97,13243.597,13261.181,I do want to note that Councilmember Mosqueda and I have been working together even before we received the executive's proposal on legislation as part of the amendment to the second quarter supplemental.,273,,
1764,0.97,13261.181,13279.332,And I think there is a lot of alignment on what Councilmember Mosqueda and I had been working on and what the executive is proposing.,273,,
1765,0.97,13279.332,13294.948,"But I don't want to forestall any questions my colleagues have, but I'm also simultaneously hoping we can wrap up.",273,,
1766,0.97,13294.948,13295.882,"Thank you, I'm sorry.",274,,
1767,0.97,13295.882,13308.128,I feel like this is a good chance to ask some of these questions that otherwise I'm not sure we'll be able to have the policy questions.,274,,
1768,0.97,13308.128,13319.306,Madam chair had had asked important questions about where funding had already begun being spent without authorization on the DSL.,274,,
1769,0.97,13319.306,13326.613,I think I cut off exactly when I was trying to ask that question.,274,,
1770,0.97,13326.613,13336.456,On that chart I would still like to have a better understanding at some point.,274,,
1771,0.97,13336.456,13388.041,"To Greg's point earlier where the SPD believes they already had authority, or perhaps insufficient storage of potentially critical evidence, but when I look at the report on the evidence that came from the best practices and doing the Analysises, it says that Spped doesn't have for storing evidence and each precinct despite they being given direction to do so there wasn't a list of things that were recommended standards for equipment to be on hand to make sure that all of the storage mandates had the same requirements for each evidence storage areas in each facility.",274,,
1772,0.97,13388.041,13397.05,There was confusion about which items should be kept in storage and which I should just have a picture and there wasn't sufficient training on which items to collect.,274,,
1773,0.97,13397.05,13422.041,"So I'm wondering in addition to this request for storage, is there additional policies that you are taking on to try to address some of the deficiencies already outlined in the report to make sure that there's proper storage and specific storage of items that need to be there, versus just a large swath of equipment that's being stored according to that report?",274,,
1774,0.97,13422.041,13428.248,"Counselor, before Spped answers that question, the evidence storage proposal is not theirs.",275,,
1775,0.97,13428.248,13438.958,That is a proposal that was part of the Council bill 119181 amendment that was adopted by the public safety committee.,275,,
1776,0.97,13438.958,13441.094,I'm guessing why isn't it there?,276,,
1777,0.97,13441.094,13447.667,Because it seems like there's a need for improved storage and a need for policy alignment there.,276,,
1778,0.97,13447.667,13459.412,"If there is not a proposal that came from the Mayor's office that is included in the supplemental, why isn't that when we had clear indication from this report that it was needed both in terms of policy changes and additional space?",276,,
1779,0.97,13459.412,13459.879,Thank you.,277,,
1780,0.97,13459.879,13469.055,"Thanks for the reminder, Greg.",278,,
1781,0.97,13469.055,13473.092,Anybody want to take that from Spped?,279,,
1782,0.97,13473.092,13474.36,I can try.,280,,
1783,0.97,13474.36,13483.269,"I'm not particularly well versed in this one, maybe Angela has more, but we can also get back to you.",280,,
1784,0.97,13483.269,13499.419,"My understanding as our policy, professional standards Bureau does, they assess all the recommendations from the Oig so we can get back to on what exactly the work plan is for responding to some of those suggestions around evidence storage.",280,,
1785,0.97,13499.419,13507.694,"I know the chief, both this chief and the prior chief and even the chief before that were all very aware of capacity issues.",280,,
1786,0.97,13507.694,13514.4,I'm not sure if those had ever been formally raised as potential items for funding.,280,,
1787,0.97,13514.4,13516.369,I know there had been requests in the past.,280,,
1788,0.97,13516.369,13521.941,"I don't know how far they made it in the process, but for improved Shelfing and other ways of storage.",280,,
1789,0.97,13521.941,13525.011,Angela might have more memory of those.,280,,
1790,0.97,13525.011,13557.744,"But I don't think it was on this current list because I don't think the Department knew that there was a source of potential funding that would be supportive of putting--once the chief had conversations with the chair, I think we were supportive of if the committee was in support of using to increase capacity in the warehouse, it was something that the Department knew it needed to do and was happy to reach agreement on that.",280,,
1791,0.97,13557.744,13565.451,"Angela, any--I don't know how frequently we've looked at our investments in the evidence facilities.",280,,
1792,0.97,13565.451,13572.025,That's okay.,281,,
1793,0.97,13572.025,13572.558,Thank you so much.,281,,
1794,0.97,13572.558,13586.239,I really appreciate all the extra time Council members and Dr. Fisher and Angela have dealt with us today.,282,,
1795,0.97,13586.239,13606.659,"Some additional information that we'll be getting after today's meeting, and I have a couple of questions that I'm going to hold for--take Offline here, again, in the interest of time.",282,,
1796,0.97,13606.659,13616.302,"If there are no additional comments from my colleagues, the next public safety and human services committee is scheduled for September 14th.",282,,
1797,0.97,13616.302,13622.542,"It is 1:18 p.m., and we are adjourned.",282,,
1798,0.97,13622.542,13622.775,Thank you.,282,,
