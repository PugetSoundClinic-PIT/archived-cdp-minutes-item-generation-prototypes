3,0.97,18.685,23.923000000000002,The committee is housing and finance will come to order.,0,,
4,0.97,23.923000000000002,27.394,"I am Teresa Mosqueda, chairman of the committee.",0,,
5,0.97,27.394,47.914,We have seven items on today's agenda . The domestic workers Sanders board and briefing possible vote on the legislation at a briefing and update on the Finance and housing 2020 work committee.,0,,
6,0.97,47.914,58.258,"At this time we are going to take public comments and then I will have a chairs report, just an update on the Coronavirus for our viewing public today.",0,,
7,0.97,58.258,61.661,"We do have one person signed up and that is good to see, Mr.",0,,
8,0.97,61.661,62.128,Doug Conrad.,0,,
9,0.97,62.128,65.465,Welcome to the microphone and thank you for being here today.,0,,
10,0.97,65.465,79.379,"To provide some context for why I'm here, I am a citizen and District 6 with Mr. Strauss and also have gotten to know Teresa Mosqueda in another function on the exchange board several years ago.",1,,
11,0.97,79.379,88.755,I'm here as a citizen and a trained economist to comment on some of the affordable housing issues that you are addressing today and I will keep it brief.,1,,
12,0.97,88.755,105.004,My first point is I have strong support for the kind of detail I am seeing in the agenda and some of the work plan for the housing levy oversight and also the housing and finance efforts and that is a Platitude but I think it is serious that you know there are citizens out there who are supporting what you do.,1,,
13,0.97,105.004,127.927,"The second point is I would love to see the Council and its committees produce the kind of integrative reports and perhaps you have already done this, the make it publicly available in terms of the outcomes, the housing levy that we passed in 2017, had a number of outcomes, one of which was to build 6000 new affordable housing units over the decade.",1,,
14,0.97,127.927,142.742,"That was a goal that would meet 30% of the estimated demand at that time, so I'm curious how we are doing, in particular with the new regional oversight that will combine resources with the town, County, city.",1,,
15,0.97,142.742,147.647,It would be interesting to see if any of that plan has gotten revised or is benefit of robust.,1,,
16,0.97,147.647,153.353,"I realize it is difficult but would be interesting for the public to see the outcomes, almost every day or every week.",1,,
17,0.97,153.353,157.157,Mayor Durkin and you folks and whatever sources.,1,,
18,0.97,157.157,184.984,"The third point this comes for my economics background the evidence I looked at, I hope in terms of funding, future efforts to make more robust affordable housing available across the board, particularly for the lowest income groups and more vulnerable population, that instead of looking seriously at a payroll tax or a head tax it is called the major employers, voluntary effort for the same folks in combination with the Council, the Mayor, would be more effective.",1,,
19,0.97,184.984,187.253,Here's a piece of economic evidence on that.,1,,
20,0.97,187.253,200.934,"But the National Bureau of economic research and the Congressional Budget office have published reports, and I'm happy to provide information on how to get those, the say most of the incidents have ultimate bearing on payroll taxes on the workers.",1,,
21,0.97,200.934,202.702,It is not on the shareholders.,1,,
22,0.97,202.702,214.747,"That is not a prices paid for the goods that those folks produce, it is rather about 60% of it shifted to the workers in the form of reduced benefits, compensation or reduced wages.",1,,
23,0.97,214.747,226.459,That may or may not happen exactly in that magnitude here in this region but there is good reason to think maybe a voluntary approach alternative sources of taxation don't have the side effects and would be more effective.,1,,
24,0.97,226.459,229.596,Those of the three points I wanted to raise for your consideration today.,1,,
25,0.97,229.596,233.6,Thank you so much and it is great to see you again.,2,,
26,0.97,233.6,236.436,Thank you for coming by.,2,,
27,0.97,236.436,239.639,Is there any other person that would like to sign up for public testimony today?,2,,
28,0.97,239.639,239.973,Excellent.,2,,
29,0.97,239.973,241.941,"Seeing none, that will close our public testimony for today.",2,,
30,0.97,241.941,253.252,I will NOTE there have been a few reports that we have generated and I agree I would love to see more of a Dashboad style reporting out on our affordable housing efforts.,2,,
31,0.97,253.252,256.155,So we will see if we can integrate that into a future committee meeting.,2,,
32,0.97,256.155,263.229,We did that last year and would love to continue to do that with you especially now that we have Nha dollars coming in the door.,2,,
33,0.97,263.229,273.373,Office of housing is typically really good about getting there annual reports Online for the housing levy but it has been a couple of years since they posted their annual report that they do one every year.,3,,
34,0.97,273.373,280.88,"We are looking at the right person, I see Robin, her ears are burning from office of housing.",4,,
35,0.97,280.88,297.563,"Before we begin today today's official agenda I wanted to take a moment to talk about the Coronavirus and provide an update to our viewing public and to our employees in the city and to our colleagues, as well.",4,,
36,0.97,297.563,315.415,"To the individuals with lost their lives, as we know now there are six individuals in the region who have lost their lives . a lot of people who are concerned about going in and getting tested, encourage people to do that.",4,,
37,0.97,315.415,327.827,My sister has MS and a compromised immune system and she had a cough over the weekend and she went in and I think she is feeling rest assured that she does not have a fever and her lungs sound good.,4,,
38,0.97,327.827,337.437,So she has basically a bad cold . It is important to make sure the people know that they can go in and it's important for them to get tested if they do show any symptoms.,4,,
39,0.97,337.437,350.149,"It is critical that we identify folks who potentially have the virus and also people's fears if they do have a common cold or the flu, we want them to get well and rested, too.",4,,
40,0.97,350.149,366.632,"In this time I know there's a lot of fear going around so I just want to reiterate we are going to have a council meeting tomorrow and Council member Herbals special committee, office of emergency management, and it will do a presentation jointly, is that correct?",4,,
41,0.97,366.632,371.871,"That is correct in several additional Department had to be joining us, as well.",4,,
42,0.97,371.871,373.806,"Wednesday at two p.m., correct?",5,,
43,0.97,373.806,374.974,Correct.,6,,
44,0.97,374.974,407.273,"We will also have King county in our full council meeting to provide update as the vice chair of the King County board of health and someone who has been a long time working in public health, we want to reiterate the most important thing that folks can do is wash their hands . I saw Video Online of what happens five seconds that you are washing your hands, you would think after five or 10 seconds of washing your hands your germs are gone . They're not.",7,,
45,0.97,407.273,409.308,It really does take that 20 to 30 seconds.,7,,
46,0.97,409.308,415.982,"If you need to sing happy birthday twice, sing happy birthday two times and that will help make sure you have gotten your full seconds in.",7,,
47,0.97,415.982,424.824,"We want to make sure people know in addition to washing your hands, the Prl or hand Sanitizers are good as a backup.",7,,
48,0.97,424.824,429.128,"You mentioned that yesterday, but not as effective as washing your hands.",7,,
49,0.97,429.128,439.739,"As we did this morning, we also wiped down our areas and continued to wipe down any commonly used surface areas.",7,,
50,0.97,439.739,452.118,"If you have items at home that you feel you need to stockpile like food and diapers and water, please do so but also remain calm, right?",7,,
51,0.97,452.118,467.366,"Don't panic but we do want folks to have items on hand just in case you can't go to the grocery store or don't want to go to the grocery store or you feel ill or your grocery store closes, we want folks to have those items on hand, including toilet paper, but please do not stock up on gloves and masks.",7,,

53,0.97,473.873,476.475,We don't want to create an unnecessary shortage.,7,,

62,0.97,533.199,554.32,"And I appreciate the Seattle times coverage of how we can reach out to the most vulnerable communities, including those without homes and want to make sure we ward off any unnecessary fear Mongering that some have tried to perpetuate on our homeless community and at the same time we need to do a better job of educating those who are living unsheltered in our community.",9,,
63,0.97,554.32,588.854,"It is a lack of housing, lack of Healthcare, and a lack of Handwashing and sanitary facilities that we want to take responsibility for his public officials and that is the only distinction that we should recognize, in many cases we have failed to provide the necessary Healthcare housing so this is an additional call for urgency on us to make sure the community that is living unsheltered does have access to those services especially with any underlying chronic conditions that we as a society have not been able to help because of lack of Healthcare and housing.",9,,
64,0.97,588.854,593.492,Which is on our agenda for the Workplan today.,9,,

77,0.97,661.794,677.576,"We do not have the three individuals that are also listed on the agenda but you did hear from them at our February 19 meeting and will be Candace Faber, Baylie Freeman, and others have come forward, as well.",10,,
78,0.97,677.576,680.312,While they could not be here today we do have their full packets.,10,,
79,0.97,680.312,690.189,Why do we start with introductions and then Jordan you can tell us a little bit more about your interest in serving on this board and any background or experience you have that you think will be an asset.,10,,
80,0.97,690.189,712.578,"Hello, my name is Jasmine Marwaha and we are with the office of labor standards and staff liaison to the domestic workers standards board . As you mentioned I'm here to present for appointment to the board, three were here two weeks ago and before I turn it over to Jordan, I will give a little bit of background on the board briefly although you heard this two weeks ago.",11,,
81,0.97,712.578,730.663,"The domestic workers standards board is committed to improving the working conditions of domestic workers by providing workers, lawyers, organizations and the general public to make discussions to enforce, implement, and expand on the domestic workers standards ordinance.",11,,
82,0.97,730.663,734.834,"It was established last year with eight members, half appointed by the Mayor, half by Council.",11,,
83,0.97,734.834,739.505,Half hiring representatives and half worker representatives.,11,,
84,0.97,739.505,756.889,And then the board members then chose the ninth committee representative who was a worker and we're the table today because the domestic workers ordinance requires that starting this year the board increases to a total of 13 members.,11,,
85,0.97,756.889,766.966,"And so the Council and Mayor each appoint two members, and each one having a representative and one worker.",11,,
86,0.97,766.966,770.636,"And so the three you heard last week, fit the bill.",11,,
87,0.97,770.636,778.978,We have Jordan here who is an appointee from the and I will go ahead and turn it over to Jordan.,11,,
88,0.97,778.978,780.779,Thank you so much.,12,,
89,0.97,780.779,788.287,I am really honored to have this opportunity to serve the city.,12,,
90,0.97,788.287,801.3,"And I first got connected to this work through hand in hand, which is a national network of employers of domestic workers.",12,,
91,0.97,801.3,808.474,Before finding out about hand in hand I did not know that such a network existed and really was not very familiar with the situation for domestic workers.,12,,
92,0.97,808.474,821.52,"My husband and I have employed a Housecleaner for about 10 years now and we do that through an agency, which is one reason why I became particularly interested in serving on the standards board.",12,,
93,0.97,821.52,872.571,"I think there are a lot of people in the city who employ workers through agencies and so it is really important that that voice be present on the standards board and that agencies are going to be held accountable for compliance with the ordinance . through my involvement with hand in hand I started to learn more about the historical reality of the way the domestic workers have been treated and the very Racialized history that resulted in them being excluded from so many labor protections over the years and then also the reality of the current a situation with many workers vulnerable to exploitation, Harassment, discrimination, and abuse.",12,,
94,0.97,872.571,886.986,And so I was really excited to learn that Seattle has done nothing to try to fix this issue and to for domestic workers the same protections that all other workers get and to try to write these historical wrongs.,12,,
95,0.97,886.986,902.268,Continuing my involvement with hand in hand I also have been involved this year on the state level and the effort to pass the statewide domestic workers bill of rights and had the opportunity to go to Olympia and testify in front of House committees there earlier in the session.,12,,
96,0.97,902.268,903.802,In support of the bill.,12,,
97,0.97,903.802,927.426,"And so when the opportunity arose to be able to apply for a position on the city standards board, it seemed like a really great opportunity to continue to push for full rights for domestic workers and else was really excited that the board seems to be an example of us centering the voices of us most impacted by the issue.",12,,
98,0.97,927.426,933.432,To support workers in the struggle for full rights is something that I have been really excited about.,12,,
99,0.97,933.432,939.638,"Thank you so much Jordan, and we have the letter of intent that you wrote, which was very comprehensive.",13,,
100,0.97,939.638,940.239,We appreciate that.,13,,
101,0.97,940.239,943.509,Any questions or comments?,13,,
102,0.97,943.509,945.511,Council member for?,13,,
103,0.97,945.511,947.746,I want to thank you for your willingness to serve.,14,,
104,0.97,947.746,970.769,"I know there is a lot before the domestic workers board in the next year, and I really look forward to a diversity of input and perspective and depending on where they stand in the relationship has a different perspective to share and I appreciate your willingness to do that.",14,,
105,0.97,970.769,985.351,"For Jasmine, really quick, I noticed the roster has a lot of us for the District and wondering on getting those updated?",14,,
106,0.97,985.351,999.164,"A lot of their addresses resumes do not include addresses so I have not had a chance to ask where people live but my plan was to update the roster after the next meeting and get it completed, so thank you.",15,,
107,0.97,999.164,1017.816,"I know somebody who also employs a domestic worker to clean my house every month, which we just started recently, it has been so incredible to have that type of work done at our house so that we can do other types of work, especially with a little one now.",16,,
108,0.97,1017.816,1051.517,"Their work makes other work possible and makes the city run, though I'm incredibly grateful that we have that employee that we are able to work with and I know she also lives outside of the city due to the cost of housing in the city, so it is interesting as you get the information about where the various board members live, if there are number of individuals who are on the worker side who live out side of the city, solutions that the Advisory board --",16,,
109,0.97,1051.517,1067.366,I am really fascinated to know more about the development of this kind of template contract this can be seen as something that is empowering for workers.,17,,
110,0.97,1067.366,1080.379,And there are so many workers that set their own schedule of their own clientele and they may be separate from an agency.,17,,
111,0.97,1080.379,1094.46,"Those who want to continue to be an independent contractor, how do we make sure that the model contract is offered in a way that is empowering and not make somebody assigning something that is Intimidating.",17,,
112,0.97,1094.46,1101.8,We want this to be good tools so they know their rights for rest and meal rights.,17,,
113,0.97,1101.8,1107.372,"And they know the rights for retaliation protection and the minimal age, even if they are independent contractors.",17,,
114,0.97,1107.372,1111.477,The language that we offer will be really helpful.,17,,
115,0.97,1111.477,1124.69,"Almost like a script or a true testing, that is something I would love the board to consider.",17,,
116,0.97,1124.69,1133.398,"The board has committed a few Subcommittees working group, one is on a model contract and they hope to develop a model contract in the next couple of months.",18,,
117,0.97,1133.398,1135.834,"Excellent, Jordan, thank you so much.",19,,
118,0.97,1135.834,1137.703,Any other comments from our Colleages?,19,,
119,0.97,1137.703,1155.921,"Seeing none, what I would like to do if you don't mind staying at the table for a second is go ahead and move the committee recognizes appointments of Jordan N. Goldwarg, Etelbina Hauser, Candace Faber, Baylie Freeman, as members of the board.",19,,

138,0.97,1216.682,1219.618,"I think we do have a presentation, is that right?",30,,

140,0.97,1223.589,1226.224,That sounds great.,32,,
141,0.97,1226.224,1236.001,"As we get started here, I just want to note for folks this was something that was flagged in one of the mayors comments, I believe it was at the state of the city.",32,,
142,0.97,1236.001,1241.24,"It really perked my interest, and for folks who don't know you will get an overview today.",32,,
143,0.97,1241.24,1250.215,The housing Connector is very similar to a program I learned about when I was visiting Los Angeles almost 2 years ago in 2018.,32,,
144,0.97,1250.215,1265.664,"We went down there and they talked about the need to make sure we were doing, or the knee that they had to make sure that those who had vacant apartments were connecting people with those who needed housing, and in such an incredibly tough housing market that seemed like a great liaison program.",32,,
145,0.97,1265.664,1288.387,"I know that we had somewhat of a liaison for Graham and Robin will have to remind me what used to be in the past but is the housing Connector was rolled out we really wanted a chance to hear from you all, from the new program, about how this works and really, friendly, Anyways that we can be helpful, especially as we see potential recession on the horizon and growing numbers of individuals were homeless who have jobs.",32,,
146,0.97,1288.387,1291.056,What they don't have a place to live.,32,,
147,0.97,1291.056,1296.695,And he would love to make sure we are here to help you out . We know it is pilot program.,32,,
148,0.97,1296.695,1298.363,It just started six months ago.,32,,
149,0.97,1298.363,1304.569,And I'm looking forward to hearing more about the successes and any areas that you have for how to help us move it forward.,32,,
150,0.97,1304.569,1315.914,Office of housing . from the I will let Asha Venkataraman and Shkelqim Kelmendi introduced the house.,32,,
151,0.97,1315.914,1320.619,"And Angela Compton, program manager.",33,,
152,0.97,1320.619,1324.723,"Shkelqim Kelmendi, executive committee director.",34,,
153,0.97,1324.723,1326.825,Thank you.,35,,
154,0.97,1326.825,1336.134,"So this project did start out as the landlord liaison project, which I think we had in King County for something close to 10 years.",35,,
155,0.97,1336.134,1371.837,"It was a very service provider focused approach and so the city and the county made the decision that they wanted to create a program that was more of a business to business model that would really be a service to property owners, and so when the EEOC was activated in 2017, it became a mission of the activation and the office of housing was put in charge of developing a program and figuring out how to get it to a business to business model and launch a new program.",35,,
156,0.97,1371.837,1376.341,We did pretty extensive program development in 2017.,35,,
157,0.97,1376.341,1385.283,We hosted several different ruckus groups with landlords to find out what they felt like they needed and what would work for them.,35,,
158,0.97,1385.283,1391.99,That way they would be encouraged to offer their units to rent to people who are experiencing homelessness.,35,,
159,0.97,1391.99,1424.489,"We worked on that for a while and then simultaneously Mayor Durkins innovation advisory Council came into being and we had been working, is a low had been involved in the planning for this project for many years, but they stepped up as a project of the innovation advisory Council to create a search tool, technological platform to make it easier both for social service providers and their clients to search for apartments and then on the other end of that the property owners to actually list.",35,,
160,0.97,1424.489,1451.75,"I am sure Shkelqim Kelmendi and Angela will talk more about it but I think that is where Councilmember mosquito son, the remarks that was launched two weeks ago and very exciting and providing a lot of, you know, economy of scale and aching it a lot easier for the housing Connector staff to do their work, so that is very exciting.",35,,
161,0.97,1451.75,1458.023,So we really have a deep thank you to Zillow for that.,35,,
162,0.97,1458.023,1461.059,Without them this project would on a completely different scale.,35,,
163,0.97,1461.059,1480.345,"With that work simultaneously, the city and the county decided with some philanthropic money, to hire a search firm to hire an executive director . At that same time the Seattle Metro Chamber ended up participating in the interview process and actually hired Shkelqim Kelmendi is the executive director.",35,,
164,0.97,1480.345,1482.38,Also big thank you to the Seattle Metro Chamber.,35,,
165,0.97,1482.38,1507.839,I think housing housing Connector as part of the business community really made it seem like we were serious about the fact that we wanted this to be a Business-To- business approach and we wanted property owners to feel comfortable leasing their units obviously the human services appointment has been involved.,35,,
166,0.97,1507.839,1512.611,King County and United way and building changes all or part of what led to this happening.,35,,
167,0.97,1512.611,1521.186,"Unless you have any questions for me, I will turn it over to Shkelqim and Angela so they can talk about the amazing work they have been doing.",35,,
168,0.97,1521.186,1534.799,"It is been a great experience for me to see this come from a program development . I will let them sure how many people, but it is very Humbling.",35,,
169,0.97,1534.799,1537.135,I'm grateful for their work.,35,,
170,0.97,1537.135,1539.938,"Thank you, thank you for being here.",36,,
171,0.97,1539.938,1541.907,Thank you for having us.,37,,
172,0.97,1541.907,1549.447,A huge thanks to Robin . before I was ever here she got it where it was today.,37,,
173,0.97,1549.447,1554.452,Robin also serves on our board representing the Funders.,37,,
174,0.97,1554.452,1556.721,And if you could put your microphone a little closer X,37,,
175,0.97,1556.721,1558.957,Is that better?,38,,
176,0.97,1558.957,1566.698,"I wanted to start maybe taking a step back and talk about the why for this organization, why we feel it is a value add to the community.",39,,
177,0.97,1566.698,1592.29,"I think we all know this tale of the crisis that we are in so I don't want to spend too much time on that, but a specific focus in regards to our housing and homelessness crisis is there are a lot of individuals in our community that actually have the means to afford units, whether through a voucher or rapid Rehousing, but because of other barriers such as low credit score, past Evictions, past debts, can't access the market.",39,,
178,0.97,1592.29,1594.693,And so that is where we started with this.,39,,
179,0.97,1594.693,1611.977,"Okay, how do we figure out a solution that can increase access to housing for those individuals and lower the burden on our overall system so that we can serve individuals that have more serious barriers or experience chronic homelessness.",39,,
180,0.97,1611.977,1623.922,"To illustrate this on to tell you a story about an individual . as an individual whose experiencing homelessness for two years, sitting outside in shelters, they had a voucher but they were unable to get housing.",39,,
181,0.97,1623.922,1631.496,They apply to over 20 units only to be denied because of their low credit score and Eviction that they had.,39,,
182,0.97,1631.496,1642.04,That is 20 times together hopes up something to be denied and I'm proud to say that a few months ago in November for the first application that they sent to the housing Connector was approved and they were able to move in.,39,,
183,0.97,1642.04,1644.242,That is just to highlight the impact that we can have.,39,,
184,0.97,1644.242,1651.816,So our approach to make this a possibility is to actually focus and center the property owner is our customer.,39,,
185,0.97,1651.816,1667.232,Our business model is to partner directly with property owners and Renters and provide the financial support and risk mitigation in exchange for them lowering or waving their screening criteria to increase access to the community.,39,,
186,0.97,1667.232,1672.27,"We feel as you mentioned, yes we do have very low vacancy rates but there are vacant units out there.",39,,
187,0.97,1672.27,1682.28,This model is to say how do we make this a more desirable option for landlords to rent to individuals who are in homelessness and potentially renting to the private market.,39,,
188,0.97,1682.28,1689.788,To do that we have to take care of their financial risk and exposure that they feel they have.,39,,
189,0.97,1689.788,1691.389,That is one side of the equation.,39,,
190,0.97,1691.389,1711.309,"Over the past seven months since the pilot, we have been able to get over 70 property owners and property partners to sign on to be a part of this partnership and that is over 170 physical properties that have been included, which is close to 700 units that have been made available.",39,,
191,0.97,1711.309,1715.113,How does that compare to the old model under the landlord liaison?,40,,
192,0.97,1715.113,1729.194,"I think in their biggest year they housed around 550 people, so it is quite impressive in the short amount of time and that was after they have been working for five or six years.",41,,
193,0.97,1729.194,1732.097,So this is quite impressive as a number.,41,,
194,0.97,1732.097,1746.845,"So with those partnerships and the partners we have been able to house, over 525 and Visuals since August, I'm proud to say of those individuals over 70% are in households of color.",42,,
195,0.97,1746.845,1761.059,"And that was a huge focus for us to ensure that we were not simply making it easier for individuals, specifically white households to access units, but removing barriers that we know are in existence for families of color.",42,,
196,0.97,1761.059,1771.636,One of the beauties of this program is that we negotiate criteria Upfront so that if a family or individual does not have to then go and negotiate that once they are applying.,42,,
197,0.97,1771.636,1792.357,"And so when they find a unit, they can look and see not only whether it matches their preferences, just like you and I, as the two bedroom, one bath, in this location, but they also know that the landlord has agreed to waive certain criteria, so when they apply they don't have to wonder whether they are going to be accepted or denied.",42,,
198,0.97,1792.357,1793.558,So that is one side of it.,42,,
199,0.97,1793.558,1799.097,We have been super blown away by the landlord community.,42,,
200,0.97,1799.097,1813.278,"There's a lot of conversation around landlords, whether it is the rental housing Association for the planning Association, they have all stepped up from day one to support this and allow members to be a part of the solution in a way that makes business sense for them.",42,,
201,0.97,1813.278,1819.317,The other side of the equation is this model on how are the individuals getting connected to these units?,42,,
202,0.97,1819.317,1820.185,And that is the Nonprofits.,42,,
203,0.97,1820.185,1829.327,This is a tool at its core which is a tool for our nonprofit agencies and case managers.,42,,
204,0.97,1829.327,1831.996,This is not us trying to come in and take over the system.,42,,
205,0.97,1831.996,1837.235,It is simply a tool and Toolbox for case managers to be able to find units for their clients.,42,,
206,0.97,1837.235,1845.643,I will turn it over to my colleague Angela who oversees that type of program and has personal experience what it is like to go through that search process.,42,,
207,0.97,1845.643,1848.746,"Hi, guys.",43,,
208,0.97,1848.746,1855.72,So as Shkelqim mentioned I have experience as a case manager here locally.,43,,
209,0.97,1855.72,1863.862,"I worked out of the blame meant shelter, and peers place, serving our most vulnerable labels try to help them get into housing.",43,,
210,0.97,1863.862,1880.678,"And really I was Tasked with working with these individuals and trying to get landlords to accept them and a lot of my days were spent literally just Útrying to get them to lower their credit score by 50 points like a, I know you want a great credit score, to have 600, can you please accept them.",43,,
211,0.97,1880.678,1883.348,And that is a really hard place to be as a case manager.,43,,
212,0.97,1883.348,1893.491,"I know my client is interested in these units, even with me Bagging a connected the landlord to accept them, so high is my client going to go and apply themselves?",43,,
213,0.97,1893.491,1894.993,How are they going to get approved?,43,,
214,0.97,1894.993,1916.214,We have really taken this and talked to our case managers and found out what they needed and we learned that for case managers to utilize this tool it had to be baked into the stuff that they were already doing and to really be an easy access and so that is one of the big benefits of that Zillow interface.,43,,
215,0.97,1916.214,1920.118,Our case managers already use Zillow when they are doing searches.,43,,
216,0.97,1920.118,1925.189,Now they click one filter and they can see all of our units that have these Pre-Negotiated reduced screening criteria's.,43,,
217,0.97,1925.189,1942.44,"The screening criteria's are reduced related to credit score, tenant history, Evictions, arrears owed, criminal history, outside of the city of Seattle, as well as income to rent ratios, allowing people with a lower income to move into the unit and work with her case manager on gaining that additional income.",43,,
218,0.97,1942.44,1953.518,We have really seen this benefit with case managers and we had a lot of case managers reach out to us and thank us and tell us they can't even imagine doing their job again without this program.,43,,
219,0.97,1953.518,1960.959,"It is been really great to have a case manager call me and say Hey, I'm working with this client, these other barriers.",43,,
220,0.97,1960.959,1967.865,"And for me to be like Okay, give me a minute and I'll call if you landlords and see what we can get.",43,,
221,0.97,1967.865,1969.834,This is especially important for people who are Undocumented.,43,,
222,0.97,1969.834,1975.973,It is really scary to go and apply to unit if you don't have all of your documentation.,43,,
223,0.97,1975.973,1986.351,"So I can field those calls and so that case manager knows when they are sending this person with these Vulnerabilities to this landlord, the landlord has been Vetted and they're already going to accept that residence.",43,,
224,0.97,1986.351,1989.988,And in the case manager knows if anything happens we are here to support them through that.,43,,
225,0.97,1989.988,1995.193,So we help that lease process and that application process.,43,,
226,0.97,1995.193,2000.565,"And like Shkelqim mentioned, we are providing the resource.",43,,
227,0.97,2000.565,2006.404,We're not interacting directly with the vulnerable neighbors or making them Re-Share their Traumas.,43,,
228,0.97,2006.404,2010.308,We are letting them communicate with the community that they already know and we are providing access to housing.,43,,
229,0.97,2010.308,2011.275,Excellent.,44,,
230,0.97,2011.275,2027.125,"One of the things that I will add is when we were designing this we felt like it wasn't enough just to get individuals into housing, we want to make sure they were Úsuccessfully housed and so one of the benefits that is both for the landlord as well as for the individual is that once someone moves in, they have support for two years.",45,,
231,0.97,2027.125,2048.446,"The reason for that to your mark is that we want individuals once you get to that one year lease to have incentive to Re- sign that lease, both the landlord and the individual, and so if something happens in month 18 and the individual cannot pay the rent, the landlord can immediately contact us and we can step in and support them to avoid them going down the Eviction path.",45,,
232,0.97,2048.446,2056.754,"We talked about over 520 people being housed, we had three individuals that moved out so far.",45,,
233,0.97,2056.754,2060.658,Just three.,45,,
234,0.97,2060.658,2066.964,And there have been absolutely zero Evictions a part of that is we negotiate with every single landlord to avoid going down the Eviction path.,45,,
235,0.97,2066.964,2083.247,"We have had it on both sides where it is not a good fit for the resident and we can say look, instead of you going down the Eviction path having all the legal barriers to come along with it, let us step in, help you find another housing solution, and we can take care of whatever debt is owed and avoid that going on.",45,,
236,0.97,2083.247,2088.686,So that you are not going to this program and Exiting with more barriers on your record.,45,,
237,0.97,2088.686,2096.994,"On the other piece I will say is one of the fears and designing this is a resident that is lower income, and risk your tenants.",45,,
238,0.97,2096.994,2107.905,That is something that we struggled with and one of the things we did to address that concern is we provide $5000 in damage mitigation to all of our landlords.,45,,
239,0.97,2107.905,2112.61,What we have seen so far is that we literally had $328 that we paid out.,45,,
240,0.97,2112.61,2115.713,$328.,46,,
241,0.97,2115.713,2117.114,328.,47,,
242,0.97,2117.114,2122.887,So that fear that we will be paying out all this money for damages is not come to fruition.,47,,
243,0.97,2122.887,2134.232,"What I will say, and you mentioned areas of support, where we're spending the majority of our funding is around rent.",47,,
244,0.97,2134.232,2164.996,"Individuals were moving in through rapid Rehousing, which is the main source of how individuals are getting connected to housing Connector, once that finding from rapid Rehousing goes away, individuals are not struggling to figure out how to pay rent and I'm grateful that we are there and can support and extend that time to find solutions, but we see that continuing, just given that the Renters--even though we are going after units that are at the lower end of the market, they are still very high.",47,,
245,0.97,2164.996,2175.84,"And something that might be of interest to this group is our program is Countywide but 50% of our households moved into Seattle, within the Seattle area.",47,,
246,0.97,2175.84,2183.381,I will say the challenge of finding units within Seattle as opposed to South King County is significantly higher.,47,,
247,0.97,2183.381,2192.49,The resources it takes for us to identify those units is two or three times more than finding units outside of the city limits.,47,,
248,0.97,2192.49,2201.199,"And starting this organization we wanted to make sure people had a choice in where they lived and so we wanted to make these units in the city available, as well.",47,,
249,0.97,2201.199,2205.503,I will not try to Sugarcoat the fact that it is very difficult to find affordable units within the city limits.,47,,
250,0.97,2205.503,2208.105,Thank you so much.,48,,
251,0.97,2208.105,2210.374,"Angela, do you have something else?",48,,
252,0.97,2210.374,2216.48,It is one of the big differences between our program and the landlord liaison project.,49,,
253,0.97,2216.48,2232.73,"I used it when I was a case manager and when it was renting, the way you would do it as a case manager issue would enroll your client to the program and lop would send you one or two [Indiscernible] work with their clients but they send those one or two leads to 20 other case managers.",49,,
254,0.97,2232.73,2243.908,It is hard to access because case managers can access 3 to 5 units that their clients are interested in and our client can tour all of those units and then decide what is best for their family.,49,,
255,0.97,2243.908,2251.015,So that way the individuals experiencing homelessness don't feel like I only have these one or two choices.,49,,
256,0.97,2251.015,2255.319,"They can see everything that is available to them, which we're really proud of.",49,,
257,0.97,2255.319,2258.155,"That's great, that is why you are here.",50,,
258,0.97,2258.155,2270.067,"And touching on the Zillow aspect, when we started this last year one of the conversations we had from the start with Robin was we want to the scale of the solution to match the scale of the problem.",51,,
259,0.97,2270.067,2273.771,Us manually doing this work was never going to get us to that spot.,51,,
260,0.97,2273.771,2287.718,"With Zillow being there is a partner through the IC, they invested over 2000 hours in the last seven months alone, to Bake in this tool and capability within their existing infrastructure.",51,,
261,0.97,2287.718,2289.587,This is not a tool that is on the fringes.,51,,
262,0.97,2289.587,2300.431,"Literally, when you go to Zillow . com if you are one of our partners your account is flagged and you have access to all of these units without changing the way you use the project.",51,,
263,0.97,2300.431,2303.601,So just a huge thank you to them in the other piece is with the chamber.,51,,
264,0.97,2303.601,2323.721,"The Chamber took the chance to provide the overhead support and to provide the office space, marketing, and all the connections in the business community that have allowed us to focus on the strategy of running and starting this organization as opposed to things like how do we do hr and payroll and all the other aspects.",51,,
265,0.97,2323.721,2326.324,I think I would like to add a couple of things too.,52,,
266,0.97,2326.324,2361.926,"One of the things we had hoped that the housing Connector would do would continue our access to the Mom-And-Pop landlords were kind of the backbone of housing for people experiencing homelessness, but also unlocking the larger property partners and I think Shkelqim has been very successful in talking to bigger property management companies that have access to many different property owners and that was the main goal because we figured if we could get to that and it would be easier to scale and I think that has proved very true and so that is wonderful.",52,,
267,0.97,2361.926,2380.578,The other thing I think is just we have always recognized that when we added this into the homelessness system that we would need to make some program changes and change some rules so that this would fit because it is a bit of a game Changer in terms of access to units in the private market.,52,,
268,0.97,2380.578,2396.594,"So we are going to have to continue to press on that and that may be an area where we may need some help, but with the county and the regional homeless authority and the city girl certainly engaged in trying to figure out what we need to do to make sure that this program works within the system.",52,,
269,0.97,2396.594,2398.462,Excellent.,53,,
270,0.97,2398.462,2400.197,"While this is very exciting, very impressive.",53,,
271,0.97,2400.197,2401.732,We have a number of questions.,53,,
272,0.97,2401.732,2405.803,I will throw it out really quick.,53,,
273,0.97,2405.803,2425.723,"I remember two years ago I went to visit the women's shelter in Belltown and one of the things that really stuck out from our visit with those folks was the case managers, she spends all of her days on the phone trying to find housing for folks who do have section 8 vouchers, they have a way to pay, they just can't find housing.",53,,
274,0.97,2425.723,2430.528,And they can't find housing along transit lines and they are all the way out South and North.,53,,
275,0.97,2430.528,2438.502,"King County, it wasn't a question of the vouchers of the time, it is a question of the sheer stock of housing.",53,,
276,0.97,2438.502,2463.661,"So Angela similar to your experience, do we have a way of mapping where our shelters and case managers are sending referrals so we can see how the distribution across the city or the region is coming to the App and thus those individuals who may be a chronically homeless but also at the shelter, or getting out of the shelter system and into housing?",53,,
277,0.97,2463.661,2466.73,I would say it would be significantly easier to do that now with algae.,54,,
278,0.97,2466.73,2482.58,"We can see where the units are located in real time throughout the county Ansi distribution in real time but the other piece is seeing where individuals and what organizations they are coming from, what units are they reaching out for, and ultimately what units are they moving into?",54,,
279,0.97,2482.58,2491.889,"The data is still too small to be able to have any trends, but now with the Zillow piece we will have the ability to track that information.",54,,
280,0.97,2491.889,2503.901,"One of the things, is a mention, important to me is ensuring that individuals are moving throughout the entire County and city and we are not doubly making units available in just South King County.",54,,
281,0.97,2503.901,2514.211,"So I am hopeful that as we get our data with the training capabilities we can track this information and report back but where we are now, we don't have that information.",54,,
282,0.97,2514.211,2516.714,I will be very interested in that data.,54,,
283,0.97,2516.714,2517.648,Councilman Strauss?,54,,
284,0.97,2517.648,2541.238,"Yes, you and I have had many conversations and you know my support from watching the program open doors in Atlanta, to the liaison project, I'm so invested in your program actually coached one of the former landlord liaison managers, one of my staff, because I believe in your program so much.",55,,
285,0.97,2541.238,2556.52,I really am excited to see that you provide this important insurance to what are perceived as risky tenants and you're able to dispel myths and keep people housed because we know it is cheaper to keep somebody housed then it is to Rehouse them.,55,,
286,0.97,2556.52,2566.063,"So my question to you today, it sounds like you have made important changes to allow this program to scale at a much larger rate . the economy of scale is much larger now.",55,,
287,0.97,2566.063,2575.439,"What can we do to help you increase that Scalability and meet more landlords throughout the county and throughout the city, how can we help?",55,,
288,0.97,2575.439,2582.88,One of the reasons that this has been allowed to scale is the flexibility of the funding.,56,,
289,0.97,2582.88,2588.385,When we go talk to landlords where were to create this huge bureaucracy for you to access this.,56,,
290,0.97,2588.385,2599.163,Part of that starts with the belief early on that the amount of funding we have to distribute will be way lower than expected.,56,,
291,0.97,2599.163,2600.597,I think that is a big piece.,56,,
292,0.97,2600.597,2621.085,"The other thing I will say is one of the foundations of why this is working and why we have been able to get the trust of the landlord community is that we provide for every individual that moves in, we require one year of case management from the nonprofit organization that refers them and goes to the point that it is not just enough to get someone in but we want to keep them housed.",56,,
293,0.97,2621.085,2623.921,That is intended to be light touch case management.,56,,
294,0.97,2623.921,2629.426,"If there's ever an issue, so I can step in.",56,,
295,0.97,2629.426,2635.933,Some of the programs in our community it is that somebody graduates after six months and if something happens month seven or eight there on their own.,56,,
296,0.97,2635.933,2638.635,We felt like that was not fair to the individual or the landlord.,56,,
297,0.97,2638.635,2650.547,"So I would say one of the biggest things we have is for continued support around that case management, specifically the light touch support so we can continue making that promise in delivering on that with landlords.",56,,
298,0.97,2650.547,2664.561,One of the push backs we do here sometimes is case managers are already really tight on their bandwidth and so asking them to go beyond when they graduate someone to Self- support them is a tough ask.,56,,
299,0.97,2664.561,2674.338,I think we have over 42 nonprofit agencies that have agreed to be a part of this and that is the Trade-Off that they provide is that when your case management.,56,,
300,0.97,2674.338,2682.679,Anything we can do around resources for that case management or mediation support would be a huge help for the organization.,56,,
301,0.97,2682.679,2688.986,And it sound like you said trying to expand the rapid Rehousing funding beyond the 3 to 6 months.,57,,
302,0.97,2688.986,2690.821,It is a really important piece.,58,,
303,0.97,2690.821,2702.766,I will not dive into the rapid Rehousing because I'm not an expert there the intent is for it to be available I believe for 12 months if it is needed.,58,,
304,0.97,2702.766,2705.402,There is not supposed to be a hard stop after six months.,58,,
305,0.97,2705.402,2721.418,"I think given limitations on funding and the overall demand, often times it is run that way and you have technical issues of how do you reopen a case and Reenroll someone and all the challenges there.",58,,
306,0.97,2721.418,2746.043,"The way we look at it is when someone moves in, we are there to support them and we will figure out how to do it and we're very thankful that we have that Axonal funding, that even if other programs like rapid Rehousing can't step in, we can step in and bridge that gap and give the family or individual another month or two months, whether to get another job, figure out Childcare, whatever it may be.",58,,
307,0.97,2746.043,2751.515,So that one setback is not leading them down --,58,,
308,0.97,2751.515,2753.35,I just want to add a little bit.,59,,
309,0.97,2753.35,2766.764,"On the rapid Rehousing front, rapid Rehousing is meant to be an approach for the progressive engagement approach so you are supposed to be evaluating with the family needs at various chicken points.",59,,
310,0.97,2766.764,2780.344,"And I think in an effort to make sure that people are kind of letting people go, there have been a lot of pressures to say Okay, stop at a certain point.",59,,
311,0.97,2780.344,2790.487,We knew we were going to have to do some training and rule changing to make that work with this program and take some time and so we are definitely working on that.,59,,
312,0.97,2790.487,2811.074,"I don't think it is necessarily a full-scale change of rapid Rehousing that is needed but a need of approach to make sure providers give the training they need to understand, then we make sure we have the technological backup so they can use this system, the homeless management system in a way that works with this program.",59,,
313,0.97,2811.074,2817.114,It is a systemwide change and takes a little while for it to stick.,59,,
314,0.97,2817.114,2830.527,Just to say I think you're very articulate and accurate in saying that asking case managers to extend the time of the client beyond graduation can be difficult.,60,,
315,0.97,2830.527,2835.866,Is it at a point where you would need case managers within your own program to help facilitate that bridge?,60,,
316,0.97,2835.866,2839.836,That is something we are currently exploring right now.,61,,
317,0.97,2839.836,2846.443,And part of the other aspect of this is we are promising that support for two years to the landlord.,61,,
318,0.97,2846.443,2850.013,But we can only get one year of commitment from the case managers and the Nonprofits.,61,,
319,0.97,2850.013,2856.954,So one of the pieces is how do we bridge that support in the second year whenever there might be a lease violation issue.,61,,
320,0.97,2856.954,2869.933,We currently have a case manager that we are working with but that is something we are actively exploring to say how do we take that in-house once somebody has graduated from their original nonprofit or service provider.,61,,
321,0.97,2869.933,2872.169,How can we still be there to support?,61,,
322,0.97,2872.169,2885.983,"It may not be a full-scale case management, it could be mediation to make sure if there's any type of tension between the landlord and residents, we can deploy resources to have that conversation and avoid an issue getting out of hand.",61,,
323,0.97,2885.983,2889.586,"Point blank, we are exploring that among other things.",61,,
324,0.97,2889.586,2892.723,Let me know how I can assist.,62,,
325,0.97,2892.723,2894.458,I appreciate that.,63,,
326,0.97,2894.458,2898.595,Council member Herbold?,64,,
327,0.97,2898.595,2930.827,"I have recently become aware that there has been a steady, scholarly work that is been focused here locally, insights from folks from John Hopkins at Harvard and they have been looking at what happens when low income families are given more information about where the city's neighborhoods of opportunity are.",65,,
328,0.97,2930.827,2956.653,"Because people tend to Gravitate to those neighborhoods, they know in making choices about where to live, and they found, and again this is here locally, the intervention that was provided increased the fraction of families who moved to high upward mobility areas from 15% in the call group to 54% of the treatment group.",65,,
329,0.97,2956.653,2965.362,"The outcomes associated with moving to communities of opportunity are very, very long- lasting.",65,,
330,0.97,2965.362,2967.097,It has impacts on generational poverty.,65,,
331,0.97,2967.097,3007.371,"And so am wondering, I really love the fact that this program is focused on not just putting people where the housing is, but giving people more choices to pick where they can live, but I'm wondering is there a way that you have looked at educating the clients or encouraging the case managers that are sending folks to you to educate their clients about where the neighborhoods of opportunity are in the region as more information that people can use to make those choices?",65,,
332,0.97,3007.371,3020.35,Actually was working at the Seattle housing authority and one of the things we have looked at is I looked at the opportunity map throughout King County to see where are those locations.,66,,
333,0.97,3020.35,3032.529,"And for background, that is not necessarily the opportunity that we might think, so downtown might be high-cost but for families with young kids that is not considered an opportunity neighborhood.",66,,
334,0.97,3032.529,3036.032,We looked at how to get units in those areas.,66,,
335,0.97,3036.032,3046.243,"Those areas, especially in Seattle, tend to be higher rent, so the for the voucher holders they get a bump in their voucher payment standard to be able to afford that.",66,,
336,0.97,3046.243,3052.349,"Seattle housing authority, Quay County, our partners, to utilize our tool to help their clients find units.",66,,
337,0.97,3052.349,3057.654,One thing we're trying to do more of's provide more resources to case management.,66,,
338,0.97,3057.654,3065.328,In-house Trainings and lunch and learns for case managers to provide more resources.,66,,
339,0.97,3065.328,3075.072,We don't directly get involved with the residence so if that is a pay case we go down we would have to educate the case managers on that resource.,66,,
340,0.97,3075.072,3095.792,"One thing I struggle with is also making sure we are not steering people to certain neighborhoods and they understand there's tons of pros and looking at research but making sure the family wants to go to South King County because of family, we want to give them that opportunity.",66,,
341,0.97,3095.792,3107.504,"So it's a long way to say that is something we can add to our list as a potential training and work with sha and King County housing authority, who frankly have the expertise, to provide that education to our service providers.",66,,
342,0.97,3107.504,3120.784,You have talked a lot about many of the barriers that the clients that you work with through case managers have.,67,,
343,0.97,3120.784,3126.022,One of the barriers I have not heard dressed is the need for larger family units.,67,,
344,0.97,3126.022,3127.39,How is that going?,67,,
345,0.97,3127.39,3136.633,We have units ranging in size from single rooms all the way up to six bedrooms.,68,,
346,0.97,3136.633,3139.836,"The six bedrooms are in Single- family homes, as well as apartments.",68,,
347,0.97,3139.836,3146.343,We are partnered with a lot of the tax credit properties across King County that specialize in building units that are two through five bedrooms.,68,,
348,0.97,3146.343,3148.011,It has been great.,68,,
349,0.97,3148.011,3153.25,We have five bedroom units posted right now for less than $2000.,68,,
350,0.97,3153.25,3155.318,In King County that is incredible.,68,,
351,0.97,3155.318,3162.425,So we are really excited for that and see these families are able to get better access.,68,,
352,0.97,3162.425,3167.531,We have been doing a lot of these professional development Trainings for case managers.,68,,
353,0.97,3167.531,3179.075,"Where we are training them to better understand the housing resources that are out there, tax credit is super complicated so we held a luncheon on tax credits or had a landlord come and work with our case managers and train them on that process.",68,,
354,0.97,3179.075,3190.186,"And so now all of these units that are on that lower and that are these bigger unit sizes, these case managers are trained and how exactly to get their clients through that process.",68,,
355,0.97,3190.186,3194.658,Did you want to ask about Mha?,69,,
356,0.97,3194.658,3203.099,"The units that you have available, do you use Mfde units?",70,,
357,0.97,3203.099,3219.115,We are currently using those units and we did recently hire an outreach manager who is focused on bringing on new landlords and looking at where those Mha units will be built.,71,,
358,0.97,3219.115,3227.624,We have definitely been targeting Mfte units and how to log those units on our inventory.,71,,
359,0.97,3227.624,3231.094,"Even with Mfte units in Seattle, they are expensive.",71,,
360,0.97,3231.094,3235.332,I think a one bedroom is still $1500.,71,,
361,0.97,3235.332,3243.306,"While the voucher can afford that, it is still a struggle for someone that is in rapid Rehousing and does not have that voucher to afford those units.",71,,
362,0.97,3243.306,3251.748,"Especially in the downtown core, the majority of our units are Mfte and other programs we are trying to tap into.",71,,
363,0.97,3251.748,3257.721,We also partner with affordable housing developers.,72,,
364,0.97,3257.721,3261.424,We are also assisting in some of those affordable units.,72,,
365,0.97,3261.424,3263.627,Other questions about this?,73,,
366,0.97,3263.627,3275.972,"Just as a follow-up, I'm currently a Renter myself and I just moved between apartment buildings and was lucky enough to only have to pay one application fee, which was $40.",74,,
367,0.97,3275.972,3280.644,You mentioned one of your clients had applied to 20 units.,74,,
368,0.97,3280.644,3284.681,And that's about $800.,74,,
369,0.97,3284.681,3290.987,"I know Robin, I asked you about the legislative update and portable screening benefits.",74,,
370,0.97,3290.987,3313.81,"I know it seems as if that is been resolved for the moment your program is able to dispel myths about how some of these high risk, potentially high risk tenants are not high risk, is your program able to use portable screening? How does that work?",74,,
371,0.97,3313.81,3322.919,"We are, and some of our partners of the larger properties the managers use that, which is great.",75,,
372,0.97,3322.919,3325.822,So one screening can be used multiple times.,75,,
373,0.97,3325.822,3328.591,"There is still a time limit, 30 or 60 days.",75,,
374,0.97,3328.591,3333.63,One of the things we are trying to get as more individuals to accept that.,75,,
375,0.97,3333.63,3349.946,"And full transparency, when we started this we try to make it as low barrier to entry is possible for landlords and so we did not say to them, you have to do our screening and utilize all these things, if you're doing your screening great, utilize her current screening, but set a lower target.",75,,
376,0.97,3349.946,3355.018,A part of that was to get adoption.,75,,
377,0.97,3355.018,3359.055,We did that with a lot of the local property management companies that don't accept portable screening.,75,,
378,0.97,3359.055,3368.765,One of our goals long-term--Karina bull offers their own screening within the Zillow platform.,75,,
379,0.97,3368.765,3377.741,Could we have a screening on Zillow and then they can use that with all of our partners?,75,,
380,0.97,3377.741,3382.178,That is the dream and vision that I want us to get to.,75,,
381,0.97,3382.178,3390.754,"As you know we have to build that trust and so if we can show our property partners that look, we are a trustworthy group to look and deliver with.",75,,
382,0.97,3390.754,3399.262,It is easier for me to say would you consider accepting a portable screening process now or we don't have the evidence to go and make that request.,75,,
383,0.97,3399.262,3404.968,Definitely on our point that it is super expensive.,75,,
384,0.97,3404.968,3409.606,"Even if the individual is not the one who is paying that, a nonprofit organization is paying it.",75,,
385,0.97,3409.606,3412.275,At the end of the day it is out of the system.,75,,
386,0.97,3412.275,3417.981,"So the more we can push our partners to use that screening, the more effective it will be.",75,,
387,0.97,3417.981,3445.809,"To my point, working on portable screening it seems as if there was a fear that the screens are being manipulated somehow and I think your work being able to dispel myths is really critical here to demonstrate that the goal is to pay the screening fee once and to have that accurate data going forward so we can ensure with the tenant that their housing meets their criteria.",76,,
388,0.97,3445.809,3451.247,And that is where we are relying on our industry partners and the rental housing Association.,77,,
389,0.97,3451.247,3453.75,We want to be champions with that.,77,,
390,0.97,3453.75,3464.26,"It is easy for me to say that but if they are hearing it from colleagues and peers, it is a lot easier to say Okay, this is something that we can go down and not as scary as it may seem.",77,,
391,0.97,3464.26,3484.981,I want to share that Zila produced a great Video at the launch of their tool . It has a really wonderful tenant story and it and I think it would be great for you to watch that and also has a link to some information on the Zillow Website that shows how the tool works.,78,,
392,0.97,3484.981,3486.382,Council member her bold?,79,,
393,0.97,3486.382,3491.688,"When you do that, I am looking at the Website.",79,,
394,0.97,3491.688,3506.002,"I know you are a new program but a very high level, some of the successes that we have heard today, so many landlords and properties, 100 units, what we have here?",79,,
395,0.97,3506.002,3508.505,70% families of color.,79,,
396,0.97,3508.505,3515.712,523 housed in only three lost their housing.,79,,
397,0.97,3515.712,3519.115,A little report.,79,,
398,0.97,3519.115,3520.516,I would like to flesh this out.,79,,
399,0.97,3520.516,3521.918,This is great information.,79,,
400,0.97,3521.918,3533.53,"Shkelqim produces a nice document for the board meeting to show us how many people have been housed all the things you're asking for, so I will definitely get that to you.",80,,
401,0.97,3533.53,3538.234,We want to say a huge thank you and I do that I also have an ask.,80,,
402,0.97,3538.234,3551.614,"As you identify where more clients need additional housing and services based on the requested neighborhoods that your hearing about, it would be very helpful to have a report back to say 60% of our clients wanted to live in Ballard and they couldn't.",80,,
403,0.97,3551.614,3564.294,That is a very--we need more affordable housing and that would be helpful as we think about where we want to continue to invest in our city so having that type of statistic would be helpful.,80,,
404,0.97,3564.294,3580.877,"If you have Statistics about K, we need a lot more single occupancy buildings so people can who are working here as individuals or retirees, if they want an Sro, and we don't have those in the city, maybe that is something we want to direct our funding two.",80,,
405,0.97,3580.877,3588.785,"As we get feedback and we have heard more repeatedly we need more two and three bedrooms, please let us know.",80,,
406,0.97,3588.785,3594.19,That kind of Needs-Based assessment would be super helpful as you get more data.,80,,
407,0.97,3594.19,3596.693,"Robin, I have asked this question before.",80,,
408,0.97,3596.693,3608.304,"Could you remind me, one of the things we hear about a lot constituents is Okay, great, we passed Mha, but where are those units?",80,,
409,0.97,3608.304,3614.777,A lot of it depends on future investments when we get fees.,80,,
410,0.97,3614.777,3626.756,How soon would be able to have map or tool that allows for us to see where those units are being created and have it integrated into an Online tool like the one Zillow has created?,80,,
411,0.97,3626.756,3639.802,"We already have a map of units that are coming Online on the Oh Website under development page, obviously that is not helpful because they're all under construction, but we are moving in that direction.",81,,
412,0.97,3639.802,3650.346,We are working really hard on tightening up our data at Oh so I think we will have a list of all of the affordable units with addresses and then our intent is also to map those.,81,,
413,0.97,3650.346,3677.34,"One of the issues around that is our occupancy rates are even higher than the private market so sometimes it is not 100% helpful to people to say these are where the buildings are, but we certainly are working toward providing much better information and I think we will start the first--Mfte program because it is hard to tell someone 200 buildings around the city, just start calling.",81,,
414,0.97,3677.34,3700.296,"At least the map will help people visualize a little better instead of having them look at an excel spreadsheet . You will be able to hover over one of the addresses and see what types of units there are, what the rent is, because obviously we have six different Mfte programs and they are all slightly different and different types of units.",81,,
415,0.97,3700.296,3710.406,"So we're definitely working on it and I think we will shows some significant projects and progress on this over the next two quarters, for sure.",81,,
416,0.97,3710.406,3714.744,We put a marker that we would love to have an update on that type of tool prior to budget?,82,,
417,0.97,3714.744,3719.315,I think that would be very helpful if we can see how that map or display comes together.,82,,
418,0.97,3719.315,3721.617,Absolutely.,83,,
419,0.97,3721.617,3740.303,"The other thing that I just want to highlight is that one of the things Emily Alvarado had some concerns around his we tried very hard to do affirmative rocketing weary or talking with community based organizations of people are Accessing unit that way, as well.",83,,
420,0.97,3740.303,3743.206,We have concerns around a centralized tool and whether that is Exclusionary.,83,,
421,0.97,3743.206,3764.827,"We want to be careful about entering into the space because we know a lot of affordable housing providers have deep community relationships and we don't want to interrupt that really great work that happens, so I think we just want to be very intentional and thoughtful about this and continue to build out our affirmative marketing strategies as part of this work.",83,,
422,0.97,3764.827,3771.567,And at the same time show the community why it was so important to do Mha and Tran 16 programs.,84,,
423,0.97,3771.567,3784.18,"We look forward to the updated information on where those referrals are coming from so we can show the community how folks are moving from shelter and into housing, which is the most critical piece.",84,,
424,0.97,3784.18,3789.685,I appreciate you being here.,84,,
425,0.97,3789.685,3793.789,"Robin, I know you are in the final throes of the session so I'm glad you could join us today.",84,,
426,0.97,3793.789,3796.058,Good luck in your last nine days of the legislative session.,84,,
427,0.97,3796.058,3805.902,"Thank you for being here to present on this incredible new asset and please extend our thank you to Zillow, tableau, Expedia, Microsoft.",84,,
428,0.97,3805.902,3819.182,They have been repeatedly investing and trying to find solutions I think this is a great example of how those experiences and resources that they have can help new folks in the housing and I appreciate your leadership.,84,,
429,0.97,3819.182,3821.117,Like you for your presentation today.,84,,
430,0.97,3821.117,3823.519,Thank you for the time.,85,,
431,0.97,3823.519,3828.891,"Okay, do you mind reading into the record our sixth item?",86,,
432,0.97,3828.891,3840.603,"Agenda item 6, 119752, and ordinance relating to fair housing relating--briefing discussion of possible --",87,,
433,0.97,3840.603,3849.345,"Wonderful, and I see Asha on her way up here.",88,,
434,0.97,3849.345,3851.247,Thank you for being here.,88,,
435,0.97,3851.247,3858.354,This is a continuation of a conversation we have had a Mike Eddie over the last two years.,89,,
436,0.97,3858.354,3871.0,"Asha, I will try not to say everything in my opening comments but I want to remind folks that this is a conversation we started my first month after being elected at the University of Washington.",89,,
437,0.97,3871.0,3890.586,"Students came to us and identified there was new platform that was being used to basically create Ebay for rental units, as you can imagine, the Scaling up of the cost and creating additional competition for rental units, especially in the new district area.",89,,
438,0.97,3890.586,3904.066,So how does this meet our goals to create access to equitable housing and we want to make sure there wasn't any unintended consequences of having this new tool rolled out in our community.,89,,
439,0.97,3904.066,3919.315,We wanted to know whether or not this was a tool that was violating or not in harmony with our fair housing laws and we wanted to have some time to analyze how they may impact the cost of housing were create inequities or other disproportionate impacts in our community.,89,,
440,0.97,3919.315,3941.003,In 2018 passed an ordinance directing the office of housing to study the impacts and put a moratorium on it before the moratorium expired the office of housing needed additional time so in June 2019 we had another year prohibition on the type of rent bidding technologies to allow for more time to be completed.,89,,
441,0.97,3941.003,3961.457,"And in the report was submitted midyear last year and gave us some recommendations from the office of housing, the budget happened, I went on family leave, and so we are back here trying to wrap up the final conversation around what to do with the recommendation",89,,
442,0.97,3961.457,3979.842,"Asha Venkataraman, council central staff we are talking about Council bill 11972 and what this bill does is repeal early the prohibition that would otherwise expire in July.",90,,
443,0.97,3979.842,3983.446,We've had a chance to look more in-depth at the study and recommendations.,90,,
444,0.97,3983.446,3997.059,It made sense to lift the prohibition so we could get some data about how these platforms are working in the city of Seattle.,90,,
445,0.97,3997.059,4005.801,"This was the kind of emerging technology that there was a fear that this might escalate into the Tmc, Lake Hubert and Lyft.",90,,
446,0.97,4005.801,4013.109,That was the original--original prohibition.,90,,
447,0.97,4013.109,4019.415,Then we ask the office of housing to collect some data about whether rent bidding is actually happening in the city.,90,,
448,0.97,4019.415,4023.486,And whether it will have that kind of equitable impact on access to rental housing.,90,,
449,0.97,4023.486,4037.5,"So the bill itself, it creates that office of housing to collect data by July of next year, June of next year, to figure out if there is that kind of impact.",90,,
450,0.97,4037.5,4069.065,"It also asks the office of civil rights to do some testing around whether there was compliance with all of our fair housing laws . and then given the results of that data, once we have them in June we can figure out if it makes sense to regulate rental housing bidding platforms and we can zoom in on the actual problems that have come up through the testing and the data collection as opposed to regulating them now as we lift prohibitions since we don't know exactly what the issues are going to be.",90,,
451,0.97,4069.065,4093.155,"The other thing I would NOTE is because the fear was this would escalate like you were and Lyft, it does not seem to be taking off nationwide the way that those companies have, and so some of the risk and lifting the prohibition and not regulating immediately would be for that kind of proliferation to happen but because it is not trying to that way nationwide, that risk is a little bit reduced, I think.",91,,
452,0.97,4093.155,4102.698,"So once we have the ability for the platforms to operate, we will know if it is going to escalate in that citywide way.",91,,
453,0.97,4102.698,4108.571,It will be a big deal for Seattle or not.,91,,
454,0.97,4108.571,4113.809,Once we know that we can figure out what the safeguards are in terms of having their operation in place.,91,,
455,0.97,4113.809,4123.118,I want to thank office of housing for their report and I think they give us some general principles that you will see reflected in this piece of legislation.,92,,
456,0.97,4123.118,4137.032,"Also, this is a great opportunity for us to try to get ahead of technologies, sometimes we are scrambling to keep up with how it will affect our existing values and laws in the state or in the city.",92,,
457,0.97,4137.032,4149.845,This is a good opportunity for us to get some data and have a really thoughtful approach to ensuring our values are met and seeing how we can track this type of tool better in the future.,92,,
458,0.97,4149.845,4152.248,"Questions or comments, colleagues?",93,,
459,0.97,4152.248,4155.718,"Okay, everybody has legislation in front of them.",93,,
460,0.97,4155.718,4160.556,"Asha Venkataraman, is there anything else related to the Council built you would like for us to address?",93,,
461,0.97,4160.556,4164.76,I think that covers all of the things that are in the legislation.,94,,
462,0.97,4164.76,4171.667,The bill itself directs OCR to do the testing.,95,,
463,0.97,4171.667,4173.369,Yes.,96,,
464,0.97,4173.369,4193.956,"I'm confirming that the bill itself directs the office of rights to do testing and the other sort of actions that the bill requires as part of us lifting the prohibition, can you go through the really quickly?",97,,
465,0.97,4193.956,4200.195,It asks the office of housing to collect data to track whether the platforms are functioning for bidding purposes.,98,,
466,0.97,4200.195,4203.799,This is if you are following along on page 5 of the legislation.,98,,
467,0.97,4203.799,4225.02,"Section 3. and then section 4 asks the office of civil rights to determine compliance fair housing laws and they ask of the data shows that they are functioning for bidding purposes and to have equitable access, and impact excuse me, on equitable access to housing the both offices work with Council.",98,,
468,0.97,4225.02,4251.547,"What about in your memo, you lift up a recommendation to modify existing laws around unfair housing practices . as it relates specifically to bidding platforms.",99,,
469,0.97,4251.547,4271.934,"Not to take them out of business, but to require that those specific platforms are operating in accordance with our fair housing laws . should we be expecting a bill? are we indicating in this legislation that we are going to work on such a bill?",99,,
470,0.97,4271.934,4293.188,At this point the idea is to look at whether there are fair housing impacts to the data collection and the testing and then once that information comes back in June of next year we will look at potential legislation to deal with any of the issues that do actually come up that were identified in the rent bidding study.,100,,
471,0.97,4293.188,4301.33,"If it turns out that before June of next year we can see that things are escalating out of control and make sense to act before then, that would be a possibility.",100,,
472,0.97,4301.33,4306.602,That is a notable thing.,101,,
473,0.97,4306.602,4320.816,The way this reads is is is also recommended that the city should modify the proposed regulation of unfair housing practices and it lists seven things that they are saying already are an issue.,101,,
474,0.97,4320.816,4334.229,"I think these are identified as potential issues primarily because the platforms have not been in operation, so it is mostly a consideration of things that could be problematic as violations of Federal or state or local housing law.",102,,
475,0.97,4334.229,4353.949,"For example, the piece around housing choice vouchers . It is not clear how anybody with a housing choice voucher would be able to competitively bid for something on one of these platforms, but we don't know has nobody with a housing choice voucher has been allowed to be on the platform because of the prohibition.",102,,
476,0.97,4353.949,4359.888,"In the next couple of months if you are starting to move forward and have a housing choice voucher, how does the platform actually address that?",102,,
477,0.97,4359.888,4375.871,So when the office of civil rights goes to do the testing and may or may not turn out that there is a competitive way for housing choice vouchers to move forward and bid successfully on the units.,102,,
478,0.97,4375.871,4377.072,If that is the case great.,102,,
479,0.97,4377.072,4391.954,"If not gives us information to say this is a thing we need to figure out how to regulate so the people that are holding those vouchers are competitive so it is mostly a matter of getting the data to know which of the issues are going to be a problem and if they are going to be a problem, and then regulating once we have some of that data.",102,,
480,0.97,4391.954,4397.793,"So about the timing of the report, much of the data is reported back to us on June 1, 2021.",103,,
481,0.97,4397.793,4407.603,"As we have done in the past, sometimes we have informally asked for an interim report from our Department.",103,,
482,0.97,4407.603,4424.42,"Perhaps to Councilmember Herbold's point, if we start to see interesting trends early on in the be good to get in early reports back, in quarter three or four of this year and then we can make some decisions on whether or not the data is so stark we should act sooner or if they need more time.",103,,
483,0.97,4424.42,4448.644,"To your point, I think this is not something that has been rapidly deployed in other cities and so perhaps two years later it is not seen as a ""urgent for us to get ahead of this one specific type of technology but we have to be vigilant and recognize our access to housing laws that we have in the books of the principles in the city to make sure people have access to housing and is so strong we do want to be vigilant.",103,,
484,0.97,4448.644,4456.552,I will put it out there to our friends of office of housing and civil rights but it does seem like this committee may be interested in an interim report.,103,,
485,0.97,4456.552,4461.757,By keeping the final date as June 2021 sounds fine to me.,103,,
486,0.97,4461.757,4466.562,"If we can get that commitment from them after the passage of this, that would be helpful.",103,,
487,0.97,4466.562,4469.264,I will follow up with those houses.,104,,
488,0.97,4469.264,4472.768,Any other comments?,105,,
489,0.97,4472.768,4478.073,"Asha, thank you so much for walking us through this in the past work from central staff on the other two ordinances, as well.",105,,
490,0.97,4478.073,4479.475,We appreciate that.,105,,
491,0.97,4479.475,4486.381,"And to my office, we have been tracking this very closely.",105,,
492,0.97,4486.381,4496.492,"With the committee's indulgence, I would love to move the committee recommendation, council 119752.",105,,
493,0.97,4496.492,4497.559,Second.,106,,
494,0.97,4497.559,4500.195,Any other comments?,107,,
495,0.97,4500.195,4505.467,All those in favor of Council bill 119752 please vote aye and raise your hand.,108,,
496,0.97,4505.467,4506.401,Aye.,109,,
497,0.97,4506.401,4508.303,No one opposed.,110,,
498,0.97,4508.303,4515.277,Thank you Asha . The motion carries on the committee recommendation will be sent to our March ninth full council committee meeting.,110,,
499,0.97,4515.277,4518.28,Or council meeting for a full vote.,110,,
500,0.97,4518.28,4520.515,"With that, thank you so much.",110,,
501,0.97,4520.515,4527.256,"I appreciate it and let's move on to our last item of business, some of the item, thank you for reading that in.",110,,
502,0.97,4527.256,4530.225,"Tom, welcome.",110,,
503,0.97,4530.225,4532.694,And we have all three folks here.,110,,
504,0.97,4532.694,4537.132,Housing 2020 Workplan for briefing and discussion.,111,,
505,0.97,4537.132,4538.4,Excellent.,112,,
506,0.97,4538.4,4539.601,We do have our friend Doug.,112,,
507,0.97,4539.601,4542.905,Thank you for hanging out and waiting.,112,,
508,0.97,4542.905,4554.316,"We have our 2020 Workplan in front of us . colleagues, if you want to go ahead and introduce Ourself for the then I will make some opening comments.",112,,
509,0.97,4554.316,4562.991,"Good morning, Traci Ratzliff, Karina Bull.",113,,
510,0.97,4562.991,4566.228,Thank you for being here.,114,,
511,0.97,4566.228,4569.464,Us folks know we have been working really hard to make sure our Workplan is robust.,114,,
512,0.97,4569.464,4577.372,This is the third of 18 planned meetings for this year and we have many things to cover that you see outlined in the Workplan.,114,,
513,0.97,4577.372,4582.678,What does workforce technology changes mean for workers in our city and businesses and the community at large?,114,,
514,0.97,4582.678,4587.582,We have talked about Tmc's and the Uber and left drivers.,114,,
515,0.97,4587.582,4610.605,Last year we had presentations about how these concerns can potentially be addressed by raising the wages for those Tmc drivers and we know this is something the Mayor has been working working on with the drivers and the associations however we know is a lot of work to be done to make sure that workers actually get a minimum wage and a living wage.,114,,
516,0.97,4610.605,4617.012,But a minimum wage would be excellent and that is something that is still on our list to do for this year.,114,,
517,0.97,4617.012,4631.226,We are talking about ending Exclusionary zoning and we talked a lot about that and I have colleagues appear to constantly remind our community partners that the reason we are pushing for such incredible density in the city is because it is about equity and making sure people have a place to live.,114,,
518,0.97,4631.226,4658.453,I am very interested in our time here is a committee and lifting up our commitments in the path past two and Exclusionary zoning and the legacy of racist covenants and we have in front of us some work to do to carry forward the commitment we put in the statute on the racial equity Toolkit and the analysis that has been requested of us to make sure that we are updating our outdated and inequitable systems of Exclusionary zoning.,114,,
519,0.97,4658.453,4674.703,We also have on our list things like Mha cleanup and to make sure the right rents bidding legislation we just passed have their t's crossed and I's dotted so we can see true changes from some of the policies we have already put into place.,114,,
520,0.97,4674.703,4682.444,One interesting area that I think all of you maybe wondering about is how do we continue to track health issues?,114,,
521,0.97,4682.444,4714.71,"Obviously help the public health is an area near and dear to my heart and while our committee does not have health of the title, it is something we are really interested in and potentially looking at antibiotic transparency policies and we have done a lot of work in the last year with some of our partners who have worked behind the scenes to identify how workers are affected by the high use of antibiotics in meat and Meatpacking and how that transfers to workers and their community and creates more antibiotic resistance in our community which is a public health crisis.",114,,
522,0.97,4714.71,4716.344,You will see that on our list here.,114,,
523,0.97,4716.344,4727.923,One area that we started with was worker for all and there's a huge interest across the Council to making sure workers have access to transit benefits.,114,,
524,0.97,4727.923,4741.97,"So Apropos of the conversation we had about those were low income finding the ability to live in our region is very hard and wanting to make sure that those who don't live in the city, that they have access to transit to get them into work.",114,,
525,0.97,4741.97,4753.115,"Lastly, we have things to do to make sure the domestic workers bill of rights that I know Karina has spent a lot of time on, that we are doing any follow-up legislation that comes from that board.",114,,
526,0.97,4753.115,4765.961,Thank you all for your input on the Workplan in front of us and to our central staff and the staff in my office for working on this.,114,,
527,0.97,4765.961,4769.164,We wanted to highlight a few of those pieces and thank you all for being here.,114,,
528,0.97,4769.164,4775.036,"You can tell we have the best Committee, no offense to all of our chairs appear.",114,,
529,0.97,4775.036,4778.073,"But her central staff being here, it is a very robust committee.",114,,
530,0.97,4778.073,4780.442,Thank you all for being here.,114,,
531,0.97,4780.442,4783.278,"Tracy, Karina, Anton.",114,,
532,0.97,4783.278,4787.382,We have a game plan.,115,,
533,0.97,4787.382,4803.465,"To talk about the Workplan and we're going to break it up and the Finance topics, which I will cover in hand it off to Traci and then I will hand it over to Karina.",115,,
534,0.97,4803.465,4829.491,"The Workplan itself casts a large nest over the subject matter that this committee will review their are some highlights and specific pieces of legislation that we are aware of it so we will touch on those things, though as we work through the list, feel free to stop us and we can go into some of the things that we might not touch specifically on.",115,,
535,0.97,4829.491,4837.399,"With that in mind, one of the first items is the capital projects quarterly reporting.",115,,
536,0.97,4837.399,4882.644,"On the 24th of last month the Council approved the resolution 31 931 which APPROVES the Watchlist, so these will be those projects that have a character that makes them riskier or having a characteristic makes them more necessary to be reviewed by Council on a regular basis to make sure they stand budget within the parameters, and so that will be something you will see on a quarterly basis . the next item would be the position list, so anytime there is legislation that adds or Subtracts or otherwise modifies positions, that will come to this Committee for review and consideration.",115,,
537,0.97,4882.644,4892.454,"Quarterly budget amendments, this will be a significant topic so this is usually treated as a packet for legislation.",115,,
538,0.97,4892.454,4899.094,That includes adjustment of the annual budget as well as grants so there will be grand acceptance ordinance.,115,,
539,0.97,4899.094,4913.675,"So anytime a third-party intends to give us money, we have to apply for the money and accepted the Council has to formally accept that money before we can receive it into our coffers.",115,,
540,0.97,4913.675,4919.014,This is an area I think will be of interest as we think Úabout greater transparency.,116,,
541,0.97,4919.014,4935.897,"It is a practice to accept grants but it'll be very helpful for our budgeting purposes to know where that money goes, how much has been spent, Intuit projects, and any kind of reporting out that needs to be done with those dollars.",116,,
542,0.97,4935.897,4946.708,This is an area of interest I think we all have--Councilmember Herbold?,116,,
543,0.97,4946.708,4950.945,Re: expecting Supplementals?,117,,
544,0.97,4950.945,4971.466,"Similar to last year we will receive one and halfway through the year we will have one third- quarter transmitted with the budget because those types of adjustments are normally part of the budget adoption process, they free up resources deployed for the next year and then we will have a fourth-quarter one.",118,,
545,0.97,4971.466,4973.868,That is the cadence that I am aware of.,118,,
546,0.97,4973.868,4977.272,"Two, three, four, no first quarter.",119,,
547,0.97,4977.272,4978.873,Correct.,120,,
548,0.97,4978.873,4988.783,"It is my recollection that it is a departure from previous years, is my recollection collect correct?",121,,
549,0.97,4988.783,4998.493,It was a departure last year and I think the departure will continue.,122,,
550,0.97,4998.493,5008.803,Supplementals are not a requirement . You can operate during the fiscal year without any supplemental budget adjustments --,122,,
551,0.97,5008.803,5010.872,"But they are an opportunity, also.",123,,
552,0.97,5010.872,5011.806,[Laughter],123,,
553,0.97,5011.806,5012.807,Correct.,124,,
554,0.97,5012.807,5028.723,"If the chair is interested, I think I would welcome a conversation of the relative merits of Forgoing a first quarter supplemental.",125,,
555,0.97,5028.723,5040.735,"It is also an opportunity to get information, more real-time information, about where we are versus where we are projected to be.",125,,
556,0.97,5040.735,5053.548,"And when we are in a better place and gives us an opportunity to make additional budget decisions and so to the extent the chair is interested in having a conversation, I would welcome that, as well.",125,,
557,0.97,5053.548,5060.021,"Tom, is that something you could do a quick analysis for us on at some point?",126,,
558,0.97,5060.021,5065.86,Not immediate but having that Pro/Con list that Council member Herbold just articulated?,126,,
559,0.97,5065.86,5067.929,Absolutely.,127,,
560,0.97,5067.929,5102.397,"One point with regards to the resource question, I think one of the reasons why the second quarter has manifested at the timing with supplemental Comps is that is consistent with one the city budget offers the revenue forecast update so prior to that point they check the cash register, so to speak, and similarly year-end sort of closeout on the accounting side takes place which similarly says we spent less than we thought we were going to last year and so there's more resources.",127,,
561,0.97,5102.397,5111.206,So I can certainly look at it and see what that implication means but I just wanted to point those two things out.,127,,
562,0.97,5111.206,5116.678,And the timing is helpful to know if there any resources from those activities.,128,,
563,0.97,5116.678,5119.113,Having that analysis would be helpful.,128,,
564,0.97,5119.113,5147.141,& GT; struck most legislation will come to this Committee.,129,,
565,0.97,5147.141,5151.112,Which will take a number of different forms.,129,,
566,0.97,5151.112,5164.259,There was a statement of legislative intent that was adopted by Council and approved through the legislation yesterday.,129,,
567,0.97,5164.259,5169.03,It required the city budget office to submit a proposal for a compensation program for board and Commission members.,129,,
568,0.97,5169.03,5173.167,That report is due by September 28.,129,,
569,0.97,5173.167,5196.19,Another topic that has been of Council interest and I have information that there will be information forthcoming is with regards to mutual offsetting benefit leases . There are a number of properties that the city owns but they are operated by third parties who provide a public service and is part of that arrangement the city provides no rent.,129,,
570,0.97,5196.19,5217.412,"Requires no rent the intent is to transfer those properties, which the process has been long- standing and still underway, but I have reports there will be purchase and sale agreements forthcoming within the second quarter, last I heard.",129,,
571,0.97,5217.412,5220.715,I think that rounds out the topics I really wanted to highlight in the Finance category.,129,,
572,0.97,5220.715,5224.485,I will turn it over to Traci.,129,,
573,0.97,5224.485,5229.357,Moving over to key items for the housing portion of the committee.,130,,
574,0.97,5229.357,5233.795,"The first is, additional funding for affordable housing.",130,,
575,0.97,5233.795,5250.812,"I think we know there may be a proposal or two they may be circulating around for a new funding source for affordable housing . to call out this is an item on this program now, council will need to decide how they want to take up the proposals.",130,,
576,0.97,5250.812,5256.351,I note that we have it on the program.,130,,
577,0.97,5256.351,5260.555,"Second item, would have to do with affordable housing on publicly owned land.",130,,
578,0.97,5260.555,5267.862,"We have a couple of issues that get at surplus owned land, city and public.",130,,
579,0.97,5267.862,5283.645,"This is a broader scope that involves not only the work that enterprise is doing, which provides wonderful mapping assist but also some in-depth analysis of some available pieces of property.",130,,
580,0.97,5283.645,5319.113,"This would be specifically related to any action Council may take on some of these publicly owned properties . one of the potential properties that Council may act on, beginning next year, has to do with Northgate and the acquisition of that property for a current affordable housing but most in particular potential future enrollment on that site . I think there is an interest in having a MLA of sorts on what happens to the property in the short-term and long-term . that would be an example of something the Council would take up in relation to publicly owned properties.",130,,
581,0.97,5319.113,5321.115,Is it fair to say this is a continuation of the work on the disposition property built?,131,,
582,0.97,5321.115,5321.416,Correct.,132,,
583,0.97,5321.416,5333.328,"For anybody listening, we need the follow-up legislation from 1932.",133,,
584,0.97,5333.328,5342.67,[Indiscernible- overlapping speakers],134,,
585,0.97,5342.67,5345.807,We are not lobbying but we are communicating to our colleagues.,135,,
586,0.97,5345.807,5371.466,Moving to the next item . has to do with evaluation of strategies to advance labor and equity outcomes and affordable housing development . We expect a report that evaluates strategies to advance labor equity outcomes on affordable housing development in Seattle.,136,,
587,0.97,5371.466,5387.381,"They specifically will look at the case site development and lessons learned from that development that had imposed a number of different requirements, particularly around priority higher.",136,,
588,0.97,5387.381,5395.39,And some things broader than that and come back with insights about how that project worked and potential policy considerations as a result of that pilot in particular,136,,
589,0.97,5395.39,5406.3,"In addition to the labor standards list of reporting criteria we are interested in, did we have something related to child care?",137,,
590,0.97,5406.3,5407.602,Not in that one.,138,,
591,0.97,5407.602,5411.773,Many other things but not that.,138,,
592,0.97,5411.773,5416.01,Moving on to the housing levee and low the --,138,,
593,0.97,5416.01,5416.944,I want to quickly flag something.,139,,
594,0.97,5416.944,5428.923,I want to raise the fact that there is a priority higher advisory committee that I think is important to work any recommendations through that Cmmittee as well.,139,,
595,0.97,5428.923,5432.627,We have talked about applying priority higher to housing projects.,139,,
596,0.97,5432.627,5444.238,In the past and the policy choice through the committee has been a challenge.,139,,
597,0.97,5444.238,5451.045,Just put it that way.,139,,
598,0.97,5451.045,5455.449,I think there is opportunity and potential but I think it is definitely a piece of the engagement that is critically important before making any changes.,139,,
599,0.97,5455.449,5456.484,That is well taken.,140,,
600,0.97,5456.484,5457.752,Exactly.,140,,
601,0.97,5457.752,5463.024,Musing to the housing levee and the oversight committee.,141,,
602,0.97,5463.024,5464.859,I heard about the reports.,141,,
603,0.97,5464.859,5470.331,They generate for our ordinance.,141,,
604,0.97,5470.331,5480.608,That clearly shows where we are on an annual basis and the Six- year duration in terms of achieving outcomes of the levee.,141,,
605,0.97,5480.608,5481.843,That information would look at every year.,141,,
606,0.97,5481.843,5489.183,This year we will actually have them reporting back on a couple of items we wanted them to do community work on.,141,,
607,0.97,5489.183,5498.292,The Councilmember remembers the issue as well as the acceptance of deferred payment plans.,141,,
608,0.97,5498.292,5522.216,They are two issues they are having conversations and they may have recommendations on potential policy changes to the housing levee and citywide funding policies as a result of some of that work.,141,,
609,0.97,5522.216,5523.017,We will be getting reports back.,141,,
610,0.97,5523.017,5524.285,Will you remind me what the timing is of those reports?,142,,
611,0.97,5524.285,5525.119,I know you're going to ask back.,143,,
612,0.97,5525.119,5528.856,Usually they come in with the annual report in March but we may have given them longer on those two items.,143,,
613,0.97,5528.856,5531.125,I am not positive,143,,
614,0.97,5531.125,5534.829,I want to make sure I have that on the committee calendar.,144,,
615,0.97,5534.829,5542.303,"Tax exemption, we get a report on that.",145,,
616,0.97,5542.303,5555.85,"We added an item that said should there be any changes at the state level come if possible, we will see some changes, that we may need to also make modifications to our policies as well.",145,,
617,0.97,5555.85,5565.393,We will wait to see what happens with the legislative session and see if we are dealing with the annual report on progress or whether we have some changes we may want to make based on --,145,,
618,0.97,5565.393,5574.035,"Based on a conversation we had earlier, is that provided in a map format so we can see distribution across the city?",146,,
619,0.97,5574.035,5581.142,They do that.,147,,
620,0.97,5581.142,5596.991,"Harkening back to your conversation earlier, the Mayor has a dashboard up on the performance Seattle that provides information real-time about production of affordable units that includes everything from the levee funded to Mha to Mft . You can see a map broken down by existing units.",147,,
621,0.97,5596.991,5598.392,It is quite Nifty.,147,,
622,0.97,5598.392,5600.394,I was looking at it.,147,,
623,0.97,5600.394,5604.799,I know they have been working hard on a bit of data.,147,,
624,0.97,5604.799,5611.238,That is up on the performance Seattle Website see you can see that information.,147,,
625,0.97,5611.238,5620.214,I would love to include that into our Tuesday update if you don't mind sending the link.,148,,
626,0.97,5620.214,5620.715,I will do that.,149,,
627,0.97,5620.715,5628.622,"Next item of note is, we know the Mayor convened an affordable middle income housing advisory board.",149,,
628,0.97,5628.622,5630.124,They have completed their work and they have a report.,149,,
629,0.97,5630.124,5638.232,I think there is a reason to look at the recommendations and see if there any we would like to bring forward for discussion.,149,,
630,0.97,5638.232,5643.437,I cannot think up and of any that would cause us to have to take some immediate Council action.,149,,
631,0.97,5643.437,5651.045,But to talk about and hear what next steps maybe as a relates to some of the items.,149,,
632,0.97,5651.045,5659.153,"Finally, issue of note, the strategic investment fund.",149,,
633,0.97,5659.153,5668.429,To remind Councilmembers during last year's budget process we allocated $30 million to a strategic investment fund.,149,,
634,0.97,5668.429,5680.574,"It would be used for the acquisition of properties that are intended to achieve multiple community benefits through the development of Mixed-Use and mixed income projects that includes everything from housing, Childcare, health services and community gathering spaces.",149,,
635,0.97,5680.574,5683.077,The executive is going through a process that we hope to direct them towards.,149,,
636,0.97,5683.077,5685.279,With community.,149,,
637,0.97,5685.279,5697.992,To look at establishment of criteria and selection criteria and to review their proposal for the specific sites that would be acquired with the $30 million . I expect we will see a report in the second quarter this year.,149,,
638,0.97,5697.992,5711.238,"How are we directing them to the recommendations, are we receiving the recommendations from the Advisory board prior to the policy being rolled out?",150,,
639,0.97,5711.238,5712.94,How does the Council weigh in on how this two acquisition funds will be used?,150,,
640,0.97,5712.94,5718.479,We gave the executive direction on the types of criteria we wanted them to consider.,151,,
641,0.97,5718.479,5722.983,Which had to do with areas at risk of displacement.,151,,
642,0.97,5722.983,5729.89,Some kind of related issues of concern.,151,,
643,0.97,5729.89,5737.631,"And asked them to create criteria, draft criteria they would work through a community review team, which they have put together.",151,,
644,0.97,5737.631,5739.033,And they are beginning the process of looking at the criteria.,151,,
645,0.97,5739.033,5750.544,They will provide response back in recommendations on the criteria . The executive will take the criteria revised and look at the different opportunities that exist.,151,,
646,0.97,5750.544,5768.329,And come back with a proposal to that community board about what they would recommend as the sites to be selected and the board what have the ability to weigh in on those sites.,151,,
647,0.97,5768.329,5769.697,Staff come central staff is attending the committee meetings.,151,,
648,0.97,5769.697,5772.233,We will have firsthand knowledge of the communication and decisions and input that have been provided along the way.,151,,
649,0.97,5772.233,5773.768,Thank you.,152,,
650,0.97,5773.768,5782.042,I will be focusing on items in the Workplan that relate to workers rights.,153,,
651,0.97,5782.042,5809.17,"The biggest pieces of policy and potential legislation for either establishing a new baseline of worker rights or of strengthening what already exists in the city . and to review those, the future of work is an item on the work program . that is about exploring policies to address inequities resulting from the changing nature of work for workers in the gig economy.",153,,
652,0.97,5809.17,5819.88,"At a previous committee meeting, we heard from Insta cart workers that were sharing their experiences of working in the gig economy.",153,,
653,0.97,5819.88,5834.028,We heard from Becky Smith at national employment law project and Rachel Deutsch at center for popular democracy . focusing on basic rights for workers regardless of whether they are classified as an employee or as an independent contractor.,153,,
654,0.97,5834.028,5840.701,"All working people should experience stability, safety, fairness and minimum compensation.",153,,
655,0.97,5840.701,5845.439,"Also, we had a committee meeting about worker for all.",153,,
656,0.97,5845.439,5873.467,That could be a policy that expands the existing requirements of the commuter of its ordinance to also include requirements for employers to provide partial or full subsidize transit passes for their employees . also has a component of thinking about city contractors and what they provide for their employees who are providing city services through the subcontracts.,153,,
657,0.97,5873.467,5878.839,That would build on a resolution that was passed last year by city council with this exact goal in mind of expanding the commuter of its ordinance.,153,,
658,0.97,5878.839,5881.342,Also worker protections for drivers.,153,,
659,0.97,5881.342,5888.048,This is an extension of what was already past during the budget season last year.,153,,
660,0.97,5888.048,5899.56,Transportation network company tax that would go to fund drivers Deactivation center.,153,,
661,0.97,5899.56,5901.061,That will be in effect or the law will be in effect in October.,153,,
662,0.97,5901.061,5908.602,That will establish drivers right to an appeal process for Deactivation and arbitration appeals panel.,153,,
663,0.97,5908.602,5913.474,And Ols will develop a request for proposals for that center.,153,,
664,0.97,5913.474,5947.408,"And more recent than that or what is coming up next is, the Mayor will be submitting or releasing an academic report on a very intensive study on minimum compensation standards for drivers legislation was passed during budget setting the stage and the foundation for what the rules would look like, what the study would look like, driver engagement, that is culminating in a report that will be released at the end of March.",153,,
665,0.97,5947.408,5963.057,"In May the executive will actually transmit legislation that will take findings from the community engagement in the report to propose a minimum compensation for drivers that would be baseline, Seattle minimum wage for large employers that is $16.39 an hour this year plus reasonable expenses.",153,,
666,0.97,5963.057,5969.563,And that law right now is scheduled to go into effect July 1 if it passes Council approval.,153,,
667,0.97,5969.563,5974.168,"Next, is a domestic worker standards board.",153,,
668,0.97,5974.168,5977.471,This spring they will be sharing their topics for a Two- year Workplan.,153,,
669,0.97,5977.471,5979.84,We look forward to that.,153,,
670,0.97,5979.84,5992.186,The actual recommendations for what to do with the two-year Workplan should follow in the first quarter of next year.,153,,
671,0.97,5992.186,6003.497,"The Office of labor standards, this committee will continue to monitor implementation of their contracts with community organizations for worker and business outreach . They are enforcement of Seattle's labor standards, policy developments.",153,,
672,0.97,6003.497,6017.144,"And they have a lot going on this year in addition to the domestic worker standards board and labor standards advisory committee which is focusing on Misclassification this year and outreach, they will have a new director.",153,,
673,0.97,6017.144,6023.083,And our understanding is that the new director sometime in the near future will be announced.,153,,
674,0.97,6023.083,6034.128,And that director will be coming before the Council for confirmation.,153,,
675,0.97,6034.128,6035.829,And office of labor standards also has many laws going into effect this year.,153,,
676,0.97,6035.829,6037.03,We already heard about the Deactivation rights ordinance.,153,,
677,0.97,6037.03,6041.969,The could be a minimum compensation ordinance for drivers.,153,,
678,0.97,6041.969,6047.708,There are four laws protecting hotel workers going into effect and also the commuter benefits ordinance.,153,,
679,0.97,6047.708,6058.752,The current version when into effect in January one.,153,,
680,0.97,6059.219,6060.02,There are many more items on here.,153,,
681,0.97,6060.02,6066.76,One of them I will focus on is the review of a response to a statement of legislative intent there Wa passed last budget.,153,,
682,0.97,6066.76,6076.537,Asking Finance and administrative services to provide a report on adding questions to title VI business license regarding business characteristics.,153,,
683,0.97,6076.537,6082.209,"The example of those type of questions could include, how many employees does the business employee in Seattle and worldwide?",153,,
684,0.97,6082.209,6095.189,Back to provide critical information when developing any of these labor standards that impact workers to know how many businesses could be impacted if there is a tiered system of requirements based on the business size.,153,,
685,0.97,6095.189,6096.09,Thank you.,154,,
