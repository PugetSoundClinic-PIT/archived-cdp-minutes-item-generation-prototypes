21,0.97,97.297,101.468,"I should say first, sorry, we do have a public comment period.",10,,
22,0.97,101.468,108.241,I want to confirm with it that we do not have anybody signed up for public comment.,10,,
23,0.97,108.241,112.512,There are no public comment registrants.,11,,
24,0.97,112.512,112.779,Okay.,12,,
25,0.97,112.779,115.415,"In that case, we will proceed.",12,,
26,0.97,115.415,120.086,Public comment period is open and closed.,12,,
27,0.97,120.086,121.187,So my apologies.,12,,
28,0.97,121.187,126.726,I'm really excited about the presentation from office of arts and culture today.,12,,
29,0.97,126.726,130.597,They'll be presenting their annual report on the public art program.,12,,
30,0.97,130.597,138.471,We all know that our local artists provide important opportunities for us to connect.,12,,
31,0.97,138.471,138.872,Art provokes us.,12,,
32,0.97,138.872,143.877,It makes us think about how our society is or is not functioning.,12,,
33,0.97,143.877,151.184,"And as an example, I had the privilege of attending the AIDS Memorial Pathway opening at Cal Anderson park last month.",12,,
34,0.97,151.184,162.228,And had an opportunity to listen to the artists who were sharing their stories about their own experience during the AIDS pandemic.,12,,
35,0.97,162.228,174.107,"And just being in that setting, in that context, hearing their stories again reminded me of my own friends from high school and college, you know, who were terrified of contracting AIDS.",12,,
36,0.97,174.107,185.118,I still have several friends and family members who are gay and I just remember the palpable fear at the time that people were going to contract it.,12,,
37,0.97,185.118,193.927,So that conversation reminded me of a friend who was brutally assaulted due to Phobia.,12,,
38,0.97,193.927,201.935,It really just made me reflect on how different the outcomes are now for people who are living with HIV today.,12,,
39,0.97,201.935,207.173,"And just being able to say that, right, people who are living with HIV today.",12,,
40,0.97,207.173,213.68,Something we couldn't say in the 80s.,12,,
41,0.97,213.68,216.783,I've had several discussions with friends and family then.,12,,
42,0.97,216.783,224.157,And all of these conversations were jarred by the public art project supported by the city of Seattle.,12,,
43,0.97,224.157,229.195,So I'm excited to hear about what we're doing in general with the public art program.,12,,
44,0.97,229.195,247.013,Because it really is an important way for us to connect with one another to humanize the built environment and to really think about our society and the reflection of the artists on our society.,12,,
45,0.97,247.013,247.413,And it's free.,12,,
46,0.97,247.413,251.884,Which is maybe just as important as all the other pieces of that program.,12,,
47,0.97,251.884,268.601,So we will be hearing today from Calandra and I don't know if there's anybody else coming from the Department.,12,,
48,0.97,268.601,271.237,Amy Wynn is here.,12,,
49,0.97,271.237,271.471,Yay.,12,,
50,0.97,271.471,271.804,I'm excited.,12,,
51,0.97,271.804,273.106,So let us continue.,12,,
52,0.97,273.106,278.845,"And we will, I'll ask you to please read item one into the record.",12,,
53,0.97,278.845,285.551,"Item one, public art annual report for briefing and discussion.",13,,
54,0.97,285.551,285.852,Perfect.,14,,
55,0.97,285.852,286.052,Okay.,14,,
56,0.97,286.052,287.42,So I all ready gave my introduction.,14,,
57,0.97,287.42,291.658,I'm going to hand it over to the arts Department and hear what Y'all have to say.,14,,
58,0.97,291.658,297.397,"Thank you so much Council member Morales, and thank you to all the Council members.",15,,
59,0.97,297.397,302.235,We're really pleased to be here today to share about the public art program.,15,,
60,0.97,302.235,306.606,"I am joined by my colleague, Amy Wynn.",15,,
61,0.97,306.606,308.975,And we're going to to several things today.,15,,
62,0.97,308.975,312.412,We're going to talk about what's happened over the last couple years in the program.,15,,
63,0.97,312.412,324.223,We're going to share a little bit of data about both the folks who we have been commissioning as well as kind of what our partnerships look like going forward with our capital Department.,15,,
64,0.97,324.223,331.898,"But I did want to reflect just some of the pieces that Council member Morales, you were Referencing around the AIDS Memorial Pathway.",15,,
65,0.97,331.898,334.6,And that's a project that we're going to talk more about.,15,,
66,0.97,334.6,345.778,But I do think that public art is this opportunity for us to have a public conversation about issues that are important to the community.,15,,
67,0.97,345.778,350.817,"And it, you know, art gives us an opportunity to share things in different modes.",15,,
68,0.97,350.817,353.353,And it allows people to engage in different ways.,15,,
69,0.97,353.353,365.665,And I do think that something like the AIDS Memorial Pathway allows us to have that conversation about something like health and well being and which communities have been impacted the most.,15,,
70,0.97,365.665,372.372,"In ways that, you know, sometimes reports aren't able to have the same sort of impact.",15,,
71,0.97,372.372,375.675,"Those spaces that, you know, we do public art in public.",15,,
72,0.97,375.675,382.648,It happens in all of the spaces that we walk through everyday in our parks.,15,,
73,0.97,382.648,386.953,On our streets.,15,,
74,0.97,386.953,391.023,And it gives us an opportunity to stop and reflect and take a moment.,15,,
75,0.97,391.023,397.029,It's a program that's important to our office.,15,,
76,0.97,397.029,398.664,We're celebrating our 50th anniversary this year.,15,,
77,0.97,398.664,399.732,We've been here 50 years.,15,,
78,0.97,399.732,402.335,We've been doing this work for 50 years.,15,,
79,0.97,402.335,407.173,The city of Seattle has one of the oldest public art programs in the country.,15,,
80,0.97,407.173,414.747,We have the second oldest program which means we have this incredible collection that we maintained.,15,,
81,0.97,414.747,417.25,Along with the work that we're talking about today.,15,,
82,0.97,417.25,424.69,Along with the projects that have come into tuition over the last couple years.,15,,
83,0.97,424.69,431.731,We have this amazing collection that we have the responsibility to maintain and keep making pristine.,15,,
84,0.97,431.731,436.068,And make sure we're in conversation with our past especially as we go forward.,15,,
85,0.97,436.068,455.588,I'm realizing that I don't think I introduced myself I'll take a moment to say I'm Callandra Childers.,15,,
86,0.97,455.588,471.437,"Making sure everything we do is done through a racial equity Lense and really investigating who is benefiting from these programs, where in the community they are situated and who exactly we're engaging when we have these tunes.",15,,
87,0.97,471.437,481.38,"I'm joined today by my colleague, Amy, and I'm super thrilled to introduce Amy as the public art director to the community and economic development committee.",15,,
88,0.97,481.38,487.186,She joined us in the middle of the pandemic so she's very new on our staff but is not new to the city.,15,,
89,0.97,487.186,495.361,"She's worked in the Department of transportation, the Department of neighborhoods and also worked if the city council members office previously.",15,,
90,0.97,495.361,508.507,So she has a wealth of city experience and brings in a lot of really relevant experience in the ways of urban planning and Participatory processes that are going to be hugely beneficial for the program.,15,,
91,0.97,508.507,526.025,But I'm excited to have her share a little bit about her vision about where the program is going from here and then just to make sure everybody is a little bit familiar with how the program is situated so the city of Seattle has a 1% for art ordinance.,15,,
92,0.97,526.025,528.694,Which means every time we build a Capitol project.,15,,
93,0.97,528.694,538.104,"Whether it be a fire station, a park, or a roadway, 1% of the Capitol project is dedicated through art.",15,,
94,0.97,538.104,540.072,That funding comes through our office.,15,,
95,0.97,540.072,542.942,And we work with those Capitol departments.,15,,
96,0.97,542.942,559.392,Those are key partners to Codevelop projects that meet the needs of both the Capitol Department as well as our goals that are really centered around how do we integrate the artist's voice into the civic landscape.,15,,
97,0.97,559.392,563.129,We can be talking about big major sculptural pieces.,15,,
98,0.97,563.129,572.271,And we can be talking about community of practice where people are engaging in conversations and it might be something that's very transient.,15,,
99,0.97,572.271,577.209,Something that's a pop up that happens in just a moment of time.,15,,
100,0.97,577.209,583.616,Something that speaks to that moment in time approach is that creative comment event that just kicked off this weekend.,15,,
101,0.97,583.616,588.521,We had two days of dedicated programming from 11:00 A.M.,15,,
102,0.97,588.521,589.055,To 7:00 P.M.,15,,
103,0.97,589.055,590.556,We had artists performing.,15,,
104,0.97,590.556,593.559,We had lots of different kinds of engagement.,15,,
105,0.97,593.559,595.494,That's what public art can look like.,15,,
106,0.97,595.494,598.264,And I think I will pass it off to Amy.,15,,
107,0.97,598.264,605.037,Because I think that's where you're getting started with this.,15,,
108,0.97,605.037,610.643,"Thank you, Callandra and thank you for the opportunity to just share.",16,,
109,0.97,610.643,614.68,A bit of context on why we're here presenting today.,16,,
110,0.97,614.68,621.587,"This is in response, council asked us after 2018 to report back on an annual basis.",16,,
111,0.97,621.587,626.258,Today we'll be sharing with you information from specifically 2020 and 2019.,16,,
112,0.97,626.258,636.569,We weren't able to present to Council last year due to Covid- 19 but we wanted to also just take some time to talk about the exciting work that we're doing in 2021.,16,,
113,0.97,636.569,657.256,"So when you hear--when we define new projects, public art is complex and what Callandra was saying there, we pinpointed that year as when that project started, recognizing that you'll see things labeled as 2019 that have yet to be constructed yet but that's the nature of how our work goes.",16,,
114,0.97,657.256,659.425,And this is just a Shameless plug.,16,,
115,0.97,659.425,663.229,If you love all of the images that you're seeing on this power point today.,16,,
116,0.97,663.229,670.803,"Please go to the Website, we have a wonderful Archive.",16,,
117,0.97,670.803,674.173,Our registrar in the public art team Maintaine this E museum.,16,,
118,0.97,674.173,677.076,If you ever want to see the art work yourself.,16,,
119,0.97,677.076,680.713,Take the time and look through our art catalog.,16,,
120,0.97,680.713,683.315,All the images are taken from the E museum.,16,,
121,0.97,683.315,687.319,Let me jump into creative comments.,16,,
122,0.97,687.319,689.455,We're really excited about this.,16,,
123,0.97,689.455,705.504,"And, you know, if you--kind of stepping back and thinking about taking from this presentation, I think what you'll hear in 2020 is really the amazing work that this team has done to really Pivot and meet the needs of Covid-19.",16,,
124,0.97,705.504,710.242,And that's really what you'll hear in these stories.,16,,
125,0.97,710.242,712.078,How did respond in 2021.,16,,
126,0.97,712.078,714.78,How is public art part of that recovery.,16,,
127,0.97,714.78,717.683,How are we responding to this cultural moment.,16,,
128,0.97,717.683,734.767,"Creative comments started out of this question around we saw so much innovation in public space in 2020 and what we've been able to do for our small businesses, our retailers, our restaurants.",16,,
129,0.97,734.767,742.608,So we were lucky enough to be part of the welcome back weeks programming the city is doing in July.,16,,
130,0.97,742.608,752.084,But we'll be continuing on through August and September in partnership with the Seattle Department of transportation with parks.,16,,
131,0.97,752.084,755.054,Really taking an intentional curator model.,16,,
132,0.97,755.054,756.422,So really excited.,16,,
133,0.97,756.422,763.562,We'll be in neighborhoods like Othello.,16,,
134,0.97,763.562,763.929,Rainier Beach.,16,,
135,0.97,763.929,765.03,Westwood.,16,,
136,0.97,765.03,767.266,Just really fabulous programming.,16,,
137,0.97,767.266,768.734,So please check us out.,16,,
138,0.97,768.734,774.039,"This weekend, we'll be in Occidental in West Lake.",16,,
139,0.97,774.039,775.808,Audra will be appointed later.,16,,
140,0.97,775.808,784.25,She's been hosting these events and doing an absolutely fantastic job.,16,,
141,0.97,784.25,785.918,Shout out to Audra.,16,,
142,0.97,785.918,793.159,"As we were all hit in this, how do we do our work, how do we Pivot to virtual?",16,,
143,0.97,793.159,797.963,How do we Prioritize artists that have lost work?,16,,
144,0.97,797.963,808.107,"So in April 2020, public art in partnership with the interdepartmental work of Seattle together.",16,,
145,0.97,808.107,814.613,"You remember during this time, there were people around the world making a joyful noise at night.",16,,
146,0.97,814.613,818.45,We were thinking AB what's the visual response to that.,16,,
147,0.97,818.45,825.658,So the product that was produced was actually commissioning twelve artists.,16,,
148,0.97,825.658,831.063,Majority Bipoc artists that created unique designs printed on choreographed yard signs.,16,,
149,0.97,831.063,834.8,And the yard signs were distributed around the city.,16,,
150,0.97,834.8,843.876,Specifically in target neighborhoods that we know that--where communities of color live that have been hit the hardest.,16,,
151,0.97,843.876,854.22,We layered using our Opcds equity index just to make sure we're putting this art in communities that are hit the hardest and we've had a great response for it.,16,,
152,0.97,854.22,863.295,"I'll tell you Anecdotally, I think we saw people trying to steal these signs, we're like come on man, you can't take those home, this is art work for the people.",16,,
153,0.97,863.295,872.638,But to give you that sense of how quickly this team was able to Pivot and get money in the hands of artists but also spread that joy across Seattle.,16,,
154,0.97,872.638,876.242,And so these are just three of those designs that are featured.,16,,
155,0.97,876.242,878.177,But all of them are beautiful.,16,,
156,0.97,878.177,894.827,And artists were selected not only thinking about how to Prioritize Bipoc voices but artists with connections to specific neighborhoods like Lake city and the China town International district so art was relevant to those neighborhoods as well.,16,,
157,0.97,894.827,899.431,"Building on that, another public art project.",16,,
158,0.97,899.431,901.233,An effort across many departments.,16,,
159,0.97,901.233,905.871,"Shot out to Spu, city light, the fire Department, Hsd.",16,,
160,0.97,905.871,919.218,"This was really about, in that vain of how do we create jobs and opportunities for our artists and how do we showcase and document these essential city services? the collection is beautiful.",16,,
161,0.97,919.218,928.661,"When you look at all of our colleagues, all of the tireless work that they did, these are just a sample of some of those faces of our front line workers.",16,,
162,0.97,928.661,938.47,And this is art that we're going to have to remember just really the--all of the challenges and really what got us through this.,16,,
163,0.97,938.47,941.006,And it's these folks here.,16,,
164,0.97,941.006,953.018,So really excited for essentially Seattle and you'll see this work kind of more featured across our partners as well.,16,,
165,0.97,953.018,957.956,"Another big part for 2020, and these are familiar images.",16,,
166,0.97,957.956,972.438,"I think the black lives matter mural, which was really the genius of vivid matter collective, arts and Sdot really supported this work and really memorialized this mural.",16,,
167,0.97,972.438,975.307,We were just there two week ace go for the touch up.,16,,
168,0.97,975.307,980.346,But it was really important to kind of Pivot in our work and how we work.,16,,
169,0.97,980.346,996.128,Also just shouting out the business Murals arts partnered with the office and economic development to Commission artists to create Murals on board businesses specifically with the downtown corridor DC Valor and Lake City neighborhoods.,16,,
170,0.97,996.128,1003.502,"And some of the kind of other work and I can't emphasize, I know this isn't exclusive to arts.",16,,
171,0.97,1003.502,1006.271,But we were able to do so much work in 2020.,16,,
172,0.97,1006.271,1017.282,While I think the narrative is that we really rose to the occasion of the virtual being challenging but it didn't really slow down how we can continue to meet communities and community needs.,16,,
173,0.97,1017.282,1027.359,"One of the projects that started as our public art roster, this is also featured Online, this is a really great collection artists submitted their work.",16,,
174,0.97,1027.359,1034.8,We put together this roster that serves as both an internal tool and also externally so the public can use this as well.,16,,
175,0.97,1034.8,1041.44,This is a method for opportunity to select artists for upcoming public art projects.,16,,
176,0.97,1041.44,1046.311,"And generally our processes, we go through kind of a more traditional panel process.",16,,
177,0.97,1046.311,1048.614,This is an opportunity to kind of expedite.,16,,
178,0.97,1048.614,1054.987,"This is also our first year, you can go Online, it is--you can see all the artist's work.",16,,
179,0.97,1054.987,1056.488,It's an external facing.,16,,
180,0.97,1056.488,1058.39,And it's just quite lovely.,16,,
181,0.97,1058.39,1071.937,"The thoughtfulness that went into this roster, our panel was a majority Bipoc panel that had weeks of discussion reviewing this really asking those difficult questions around what is--what is public art?",16,,
182,0.97,1071.937,1075.34,How do we create these opportunities around what does it look like?,16,,
183,0.97,1075.34,1084.817,"And when you look at the artists selected for the roster, it leaves you with a sense of the future of public art is very bright.",16,,
184,0.97,1084.817,1089.788,"Public art boot camp, this is one of--this is a new program for us.",16,,
185,0.97,1089.788,1091.39,But I think 2020 was quite exciting.,16,,
186,0.97,1091.39,1095.027,It was really a pivot.,16,,
187,0.97,1095.027,1100.799,And again stuck in that vain of how do we create opportunities to get commissions out there.,16,,
188,0.97,1100.799,1111.109,"Public art boot camp, the genesis of it is really our--our answer to that public art is a very Elitist field.",16,,
189,0.97,1111.109,1113.779,You often need a Commission to get a Commission.,16,,
190,0.97,1113.779,1124.156,"We also recognize that in the whole life cycle of public art, there needs to be support and understanding those questions of how you work with fabricators.",16,,
191,0.97,1124.156,1125.19,"Installation, understanding community engagement.",16,,
192,0.97,1125.19,1135.567,Public art boot camp is where we provide that kind of hands on Knowledge-Based sharing and project management support with our office.,16,,
193,0.97,1135.567,1144.176,"What was unique about this year that's really excite something the twelve artists that selected all, boot camp resulting in a Commission.",16,,
194,0.97,1144.176,1149.014,Through our partnership with Seattle center next month they'll be installing temporary public art pieces.,16,,
195,0.97,1149.014,1153.252,Many of them their first public art Commission in Seattle center.,16,,
196,0.97,1153.252,1157.022,And also in the Lake City neighborhood through Sdot.,16,,
197,0.97,1157.022,1159.625,Our partnership with Sdot and art interruption.,16,,
198,0.97,1159.625,1164.997,"So another great opportunity to get out and see really fantastic, emerging art work shortly here.",16,,
199,0.97,1164.997,1170.702,And this is another kind of focal project that's just fantastic.,16,,
200,0.97,1170.702,1174.907,It's our Sdot bridge artist residence.,16,,
201,0.97,1174.907,1178.277,We had two fantastic artists.,16,,
202,0.97,1178.277,1179.344,Roger Fernandez.,16,,
203,0.97,1179.344,1179.645,Et Russian.,16,,
204,0.97,1179.645,1189.721,"These are beautiful comic graphic novels that you'll actually see in the Seattle public libraries, being distributed there once libraries are reopened.",16,,
205,0.97,1189.721,1196.662,And this is just one of those great projects that continued to give so much delight to the public.,16,,
206,0.97,1196.662,1201.266,And I'll pass it over to Collandra.,16,,
207,0.97,1201.266,1201.833,"Thanks, Amy.",17,,
208,0.97,1201.833,1214.646,So I'm going to talk about--for these next two projects I'm going to talk about two that were outside of our formal mode of operations within the city.,17,,
209,0.97,1214.646,1217.349,Both were special partnerships we created.,17,,
210,0.97,1217.349,1220.819,And they definitely took several years to develop.,17,,
211,0.97,1220.819,1228.26,The aids Memorial Pathway that Council member Morales mentioned was a project dedicated about a month ago after six years of working.,17,,
212,0.97,1228.26,1232.497,And this was a project that was brought forward by community members.,17,,
213,0.97,1232.497,1239.805,It was really important for the city to have a space to reflect and remember the AIDS epidemic within the city.,17,,
214,0.97,1239.805,1243.075,A lot of other cities have this kind of space.,17,,
215,0.97,1243.075,1244.009,But Seattle did not.,17,,
216,0.97,1244.009,1247.379,And so these community members brought this idea forward.,17,,
217,0.97,1247.379,1250.015,And we spent several years identifying a location.,17,,
218,0.97,1250.015,1257.222,We ended up at the transit development station up on Capitol Hill right around the light rail station.,17,,
219,0.97,1257.222,1270.068,And created this partnership with sound transit as they are the property owners as well as the development company that was developing that property around the station.,17,,
220,0.97,1270.068,1271.37,And then the city came in.,17,,
221,0.97,1271.37,1276.275,Because we have the Cal Anderson park property across the street.,17,,
222,0.97,1276.275,1281.113,And we were taking over the ownership and maintenance of these art works long-term.,17,,
223,0.97,1281.113,1285.25,So we created this partnership.,17,,
224,0.97,1285.25,1291.189,We were responsible for the Commission of the art plan for the site.,17,,
225,0.97,1291.189,1298.363,"And for that, we worked with Horatio law.",17,,
226,0.97,1298.363,1303.335,An incredible visionary artist who put together a plan for the site that called for an additional three commissions.,17,,
227,0.97,1303.335,1320.552,"So we were able to bring on Chris Paul Jordan for the amazing piece you see on the left there, that's called, and I'm going to Miss everybody, it's made up of boom boxes and really recalled the era of House parties and under ground gatherings.",17,,
228,0.97,1320.552,1323.755,"Civilization the piece on the right, that's called we're all ready here.",17,,
229,0.97,1323.755,1331.063,That's a series of protest signs Reimagined and there's several stations of protest signs throughout the whole park.,17,,
230,0.97,1331.063,1347.212,"Stormy Webber has a really amazing piece on the inside of the building that's called ""in this way we loved one another"" that Memorializes the history and the Seattle players who really moved this movement forward.",17,,
231,0.97,1347.212,1355.454,Early on in the early days of when people were dealing with the crisis.,17,,
232,0.97,1355.454,1361.66,And then Horatio law has an additional piece he's doing on the North end of the park that's called ribbon of light.,17,,
233,0.97,1361.66,1363.095,It's a little bit delayed.,17,,
234,0.97,1363.095,1366.498,But it will be installed within the next couple months.,17,,
235,0.97,1366.498,1373.638,And it's a really beautiful space of sort of reflection and really just sort of allowing people to take a moment.,17,,
236,0.97,1373.638,1381.046,So this was a really pretty incredible project that was sort of unprecedented that we've never really done anything like this before.,17,,
237,0.97,1381.046,1385.55,We're just so pleased to have been able to unveil it this year.,17,,
238,0.97,1386.084,1390.822,We'll move on to the next slide where we'll talk about the future agents.,17,,
239,0.97,1390.822,1393.058,So this was another sort of unique opportunity.,17,,
240,0.97,1393.058,1398.029,This was a partnership that we had with Seattle art museum.,17,,
241,0.97,1398.029,1406.571,The project that they were doing at volunteer park to expand the Asian art museum in that space generated some 1% for art funding.,17,,
242,0.97,1406.571,1413.278,So we partnered with them to think about what would it look like to really celebrate the Asian art collection that's in that space.,17,,
243,0.97,1413.278,1419.684,And so we put out a call for a curator.,17,,
244,0.97,1419.684,1432.197,And he put forward his proposal around future ancient that brought together this idea of how do we celebrate contemporary Aapi artists here in the Seattle area.,17,,
245,0.97,1432.197,1444.81,So he had more than 30 contemporary artists that came through for this project where there was a whole series of presentations around the reopening of the Asian art museum.,17,,
246,0.97,1444.81,1448.747,That all happened in February of 2020 right before the pandemic hit.,17,,
247,0.97,1448.747,1454.953,And so immediately we then had to transition all of these plans into a virtual Online format.,17,,
248,0.97,1454.953,1465.997,So he really kind of went with us as we went through what everybody was going through in terms of taking things intended to be in person and moving them into an Online space.,17,,
249,0.97,1465.997,1475.807,But the lasting legacy of project is there's an Aapi artist roster that came out of this that's available for the public to use.,17,,
250,0.97,1475.807,1485.217,That's a great resource that will last even after these events have concluded.,17,,
251,0.97,1485.217,1489.12,And back to me.,18,,
252,0.97,1489.12,1491.189,Flow is a really exciting project.,18,,
253,0.97,1491.189,1500.031,We're in our next Iteration of installations in partnership with Seattle public utilities and the ship Canal water quality project.,18,,
254,0.97,1500.031,1500.799,We're excited about this.,18,,
255,0.97,1500.799,1508.84,Flow is really an opportunity to showcase the magic and power of temporary public art projects and opportunities.,18,,
256,0.97,1508.84,1515.513,"And we really kind of geared and catered this to emerging artists, predominantly Bipoc artists.",18,,
257,0.97,1515.513,1531.763,"And it's a great way of thinking ability how do we apply art along the ship Canal as a means to really mitigate construction fencing throughout Ballard, walling Ford and Fremont and we've got really responsive feedback from flow.",18,,
258,0.97,1531.763,1533.865,So more art coming up.,18,,
259,0.97,1533.865,1537.102,Kind of a continuous project.,18,,
260,0.97,1537.102,1557.889,"And now I'm going to shift into community engage . I just want to--before I jump into some of the projects, if folks are interested in knowing more, we submitted an embarrassingly long report that has much more detail for all of these projects, Collandra and I hand selected some we wanted to talk about.",18,,
261,0.97,1557.889,1566.698,But I can't emphasize enough how this team--how much work that this team produces and continuously does.,18,,
262,0.97,1566.698,1572.904,And so even asking--responding to how do we do community engagement?,18,,
263,0.97,1572.904,1581.212,It's really embedded within public art throughout the life Psyching of how do we get from Scoping to the end product?,18,,
264,0.97,1581.212,1584.349,To how do people engage with that art ongoing?,18,,
265,0.97,1584.349,1592.958,So with that I'll center one really exciting project--this was a partnership with Sdot.,18,,
266,0.97,1592.958,1594.426,And several small businesses.,18,,
267,0.97,1594.426,1596.127,This is in the main art alley.,18,,
268,0.97,1596.127,1605.604,"This is a mural by artist Okuro Ishi it's gorgeous, it's different noodles.",18,,
269,0.97,1605.604,1608.206,Noodles as Steppingstones that invite you through the alley.,18,,
270,0.97,1608.206,1616.147,There's so much community energy that's been going over for years and they've done it themselves on how to activate these alley ways.,18,,
271,0.97,1616.147,1618.917,I wanted to bring up this as an example.,18,,
272,0.97,1618.917,1621.186,A lot was learned from Slurp.,18,,
273,0.97,1621.186,1624.122,We wanted to install this last summer.,18,,
274,0.97,1624.122,1626.992,We just installed it really at Úthe start of this summer.,18,,
275,0.97,1626.992,1638.303,Because it's a really great reminder and example that sometimes you have to slow down an art project to move at the right pace for community partners to feel good about this work.,18,,
276,0.97,1638.303,1642.54,Watching how the artist is actually fantastic.,18,,
277,0.97,1642.54,1650.181,Really engaged heard the feedback and said let me come back adapt this design and make it something everybody will love.,18,,
278,0.97,1650.181,1663.595,"The organic programming that emerged around this, coloring books, Stickers, Promos, it's a great way of showing you how we as a city can partner with all ready the energy that's happening there.",18,,
279,0.97,1663.595,1666.331,To create something quite beautiful.,18,,
280,0.97,1666.331,1678.043,"And I wanted to uplift, oftentimes within public art we focus in on the impact of our large, gorgeous, permanently sited works and new projects.",18,,
281,0.97,1678.043,1681.379,"But again, Shameless plug for our civic collection.",18,,
282,0.97,1681.379,1683.314,Our fantastic collections management team.,18,,
283,0.97,1683.314,1685.216,There's some very cool work that happens.,18,,
284,0.97,1685.216,1688.62,We wanted to uplift fresh perspectives.,18,,
285,0.97,1688.62,1697.028,Fresh perspectives is a unique departure for us in that we brought on young people to be the curator.,18,,
286,0.97,1697.028,1702.233,So young people actually were a hand in purchasing 60 portable works.,18,,
287,0.97,1702.233,1704.836,They served on the panel.,18,,
288,0.97,1704.836,1709.641,They reviewed the Digital submissions and made the purchases.,18,,
289,0.97,1709.641,1715.88,Also supported by our staff and that kind of curriculum with planned field trips to the foster white gallery.,18,,
290,0.97,1715.88,1721.052,The Wayne Luke museum.,18,,
291,0.97,1721.052,1724.889,It's something that traditionally portable art works are selected by a panel of art professionals.,18,,
292,0.97,1724.889,1732.897,"As you can see with these three example, seeing their eyes and what they Gravitate to is such a wonderful way of that kind of cultural moment.",18,,
293,0.97,1732.897,1738.57,And you can also check out the full fresh perspectives Online.,18,,
294,0.97,1738.57,1739.971,It's really quite cool.,18,,
295,0.97,1739.971,1746.411,This is a project that is actually not going to go into construction until 2022.,18,,
296,0.97,1746.411,1747.579,But started in 2019.,18,,
297,0.97,1747.579,1751.149,This is for the new little Saigon park.,18,,
298,0.97,1751.149,1752.65,We're really excited about this.,18,,
299,0.97,1752.65,1762.594,This is one of those examples of a public art project that really centers on community engagement in the Scoping of it before the artist selection.,18,,
300,0.97,1762.594,1764.829,The community is very clear.,18,,
301,0.97,1764.829,1771.803,Applicants need to demonstrate a connection to the Cid.,18,,
302,0.97,1771.803,1775.173,"Through the process, Chunga was selected.",18,,
303,0.97,1775.173,1781.713,Colleena has been doing so much fantastic community engagement and meets with community groups.,18,,
304,0.97,1781.713,1790.889,Everyone from friends of little Saigon to kind of really get at this design and we're really looking forward to when this is installed in the new little Saigon park.,18,,
305,0.97,1790.889,1807.438,"This is another example and we so much love all of our city partners, Seattle public utilities is such a really, fantastic thoughtful partner in this work.",18,,
306,0.97,1807.438,1819.717,"Taylor Creek, the artist was such a wonderful, really came into this community, met with Arbak.",18,,
307,0.97,1819.717,1820.552,Vietnamese friendship Association.,18,,
308,0.97,1820.552,1822.086,So many different outreach efforts.,18,,
309,0.97,1822.086,1830.762,And this is really about highlighting this work with Fpu on salmon habitat and creating opportunities for the public to engage with the space.,18,,
310,0.97,1830.762,1837.235,Really thinking about how do we create a space for Bipoc to engage with the natural area.,18,,
311,0.97,1837.235,1837.702,And great.,18,,
312,0.97,1837.702,1845.476,Now we'll be shifting into the last section of our presentation.,18,,
313,0.97,1845.476,1848.58,Annual data.,18,,
314,0.97,1848.58,1848.98,Okay.,18,,
315,0.97,1848.98,1852.083,So this table here is--there's a lot going on in it.,18,,
316,0.97,1852.083,1860.291,"As I mentioned in public art, we--we track several different Metrics.",18,,
317,0.97,1860.291,1866.998,But recognizing that projects can often take years from Scoping into install.,18,,
318,0.97,1866.998,1870.468,That's a part of what you're seeing.,18,,
319,0.97,1870.468,1881.012,"I just also want to note that in 2019, you'll see a significantly larger budget range.",18,,
320,0.97,1881.012,1883.047,That's because Collandra eluded to this in the beginning.,18,,
321,0.97,1883.047,1891.856,We've really had a crazy busy couple years between the work that was happening at the waterfront that really magnifies our budget.,18,,
322,0.97,1891.856,1898.73,So that's why you're seeing these anomalies with 2019 and 2020.,18,,
323,0.97,1898.73,1909.307,"And the--just that kind of first line when you're looking at what does that mean, for example, 2020, when you see 60 verses 144.",18,,
324,0.97,1909.307,1924.989,"With our artists, and I think this kind of came through with 2020, working with so many sub commissions, so artists that work across artist teams, that changes our ways of tracking as well.",18,,
325,0.97,1924.989,1926.924,"Collandra, did you want to add anything?",18,,
326,0.97,1926.924,1931.729,"I'll say that, you know, 2020, we really turned up the focus.",19,,
327,0.97,1931.729,1948.112,"I think public art has a tendency to--because it has projects that are aligned with the civic schedule, the civic--or I'm sorry, I didn't mean civic, I meant Capitol project schedule, things take a while to develop.",19,,
328,0.97,1948.112,1957.455,"And it's good in some ways, it's great to get artists on board early so they can influence a project and be fully integrated and not just added on at the end.",19,,
329,0.97,1957.455,1962.226,But one of the outcomes of that is that projects often take several years.,19,,
330,0.97,1962.226,1973.304,"And we knew coming out of 2020 and coming through 2020, the deep impact to artists and cultural workers was that many of their Gigs dried up over night.",19,,
331,0.97,1973.304,1977.442,And we knew that opportunities needed to be provided immediately.,19,,
332,0.97,1977.442,1991.089,So we shifted gears and we created a bunch of opportunities that still met the civic needs of the city while also responding to the need within the artist community.,19,,
333,0.97,1991.089,2002.133,"Seeing that 144 in Parenthesis, that indicates we contracted with a lot of artists to do a lot of work that was much faster turn around time than what we traditionally do.",19,,
334,0.97,2002.133,2008.373,And that was very intentional to respond to the needs of the community in the moment.,19,,
335,0.97,2009.874,2019.951,Just wanted to--we have a pretty comprehensive Appendix many the report that we submitted by our fabulous impacted assessment manager.,20,,
336,0.97,2019.951,2025.223,I wanted to call out a couple of our data points that's really quite cool.,20,,
337,0.97,2025.223,2031.596,"In 2020, we nearly doubled the number of Bipoc artists who were commissioned.",20,,
338,0.97,2031.596,2037.902,"And as you can see here, we continued to be in the 400-500S for applications received.",20,,
339,0.97,2037.902,2045.176,That's part of the kind of outreach and work that we do to promote our calls and opportunities.,20,,
340,0.97,2045.176,2062.727,We've also increased the amount in 2020 of what that kind of direct select opportunity is which was able to really allow us to Prioritize Bipoc artists as well.,20,,
341,0.97,2062.727,2063.394,I'm going to --,20,,
342,0.97,2063.394,2065.196,Can I ask --,21,,
343,0.97,2065.196,2067.632,Go for it.,22,,
344,0.97,2067.632,2071.602,I want to stay on this slide.,23,,
345,0.97,2071.602,2073.204,You had 592 applicants.,23,,
346,0.97,2073.204,2077.175,You were able to fund 21.,23,,
347,0.97,2077.175,2080.445,Is that right?,23,,
348,0.97,2080.445,2085.683,"Well, so I'm sorry, where is the 21 figure?",24,,
349,0.97,2085.683,2091.189,The first bullet point?,24,,
350,0.97,2091.189,2091.456,Yeah.,25,,
351,0.97,2091.456,2102.266,The 2019--so the 21 individual artists is looking at working solo and then there's artist teams working within that as well.,25,,
352,0.97,2102.266,2105.036,"So yes, that is accurate.",25,,
353,0.97,2105.036,2105.336,Okay.,26,,
354,0.97,2105.336,2112.477,It feels really--there's a lot of people interested in applying for these funds.,26,,
355,0.97,2112.477,2117.014,I think that number might be particularly high this time around.,27,,
356,0.97,2117.014,2123.221,I believe that reflects--so there are calls that we do to bring in artists on to an active project.,27,,
357,0.97,2123.221,2126.991,There are also calls that we do to increase our civic collection.,27,,
358,0.97,2126.991,2130.862,So when we do a call for work that's all ready been created.,27,,
359,0.97,2130.862,2135.6,Those calls often result in hundreds and hundreds of folks.,27,,
360,0.97,2135.6,2140.037,Because it's--it tends to be two dimensional work that's all ready created.,27,,
361,0.97,2140.037,2143.808,That may be why we're seeing discrepancy in numbers right there.,27,,
362,0.97,2143.808,2150.181,"But yes, I will say that a lot of these projects, we do see a high response rate.",27,,
363,0.97,2150.181,2154.452,People are very interested in being engaged in these types of opportunities.,27,,
364,0.97,2156.053,2159.357,Thank you.,28,,
365,0.97,2161.125,2166.597,This is a kind of--a look at our demographics.,29,,
366,0.97,2166.597,2175.206,We've included both here the kind of--both early stage candidates and what ultimately results in the Commission.,29,,
367,0.97,2175.206,2188.92,I think something that is I think really quite compelling about 2020 is we are--our demographics was--we were at 70% Bipoc identified artists.,29,,
368,0.97,2188.92,2197.228,"And if you NOTE as well, Collandra, did you want to talk about the waterfront?",29,,
369,0.97,2197.228,2204.235,"Specifically native American, Alaska native I Ding Newhouse artists.",29,,
370,0.97,2204.235,2205.436,Indigenous artists.,30,,
371,0.97,2205.436,2210.174,We've gotten to the stage where we can share a chart like this with you all.,31,,
372,0.97,2210.174,2215.479,One of the numbers I'll call your attention to.,31,,
373,0.97,2215.479,2225.823,"Native, Alaska native, and indigenous, the commissioned rate from 2019 to 2020 jumps dramatically from under 5% to 17%.",31,,
374,0.97,2225.823,2233.898,"And that, you know, I think we've been intentional about creating specific opportunities for indigenous artists.",31,,
375,0.97,2233.898,2238.502,Some opportunities have happened through the flow project Amy was talking about earlier.,31,,
376,0.97,2238.502,2241.239,We also had several specific opportunities on the waterfront.,31,,
377,0.97,2241.239,2243.507,We didn't talk about the waterfront art today.,31,,
378,0.97,2243.507,2249.08,I think that would be Wort while to bring if the office of the waterfront team to talk about the project as a whole.,31,,
379,0.97,2249.08,2253.117,Because the art work is very integrated into the whole concept design.,31,,
380,0.97,2253.117,2260.424,"We have quite a few projects going on down there and strong, strong indigenous artist representation.",31,,
381,0.97,2260.424,2269.166,And something I think is really important is we're seeing a number of indigenous artists successful in these commissions that are not specific to indigenous culture.,31,,
382,0.97,2269.166,2282.013,And I think that that means that we're getting the be more successful in integrating indigenous artist into our standard practices and that we're seeing them be successful within the commissioning process.,31,,
383,0.97,2282.013,2284.248,So that's something that we've been focused on.,31,,
384,0.97,2284.248,2287.318,And I'm happy to see movement in that direction.,31,,
385,0.97,2287.318,2296.894,Do we have a couple of data points that are just missing from this that I also just want to call and name out.,32,,
386,0.97,2296.894,2303.834,"In these figures, in the table, it does not include the black lives matter mural artists.",32,,
387,0.97,2303.834,2316.447,Nor does it include Spruce Streetman E park it's an exciting project we're working with Seattle parks and recreation district.,32,,
388,0.97,2316.447,2316.914,Shifting our motto.,32,,
389,0.97,2316.914,2326.357,We brought on artist David Brown and his son Kirkland to do the community engagement the Prescoping work before going straight to artist selection.,32,,
390,0.97,2326.357,2348.713,And it's a model that is going really quite well and really thinking about how we can intentionally create opportunities more like that to bring Bipoc artists in earlier at different stages than just the art work itself.,32,,
391,0.97,2348.713,2351.182,And Yeah.,32,,
392,0.97,2351.182,2352.85,Anything else Collandra on your side?,32,,
393,0.97,2352.85,2354.552,I don't think so.,33,,
394,0.97,2354.552,2357.088,I know we just sped through a lot of information.,33,,
395,0.97,2357.088,2358.422,A lot of projects.,33,,
396,0.97,2358.422,2362.226,We wanted to leave a couple minutes at the end for any questions.,33,,
397,0.97,2362.226,2364.095,We didn't get to the last slide.,33,,
398,0.97,2364.095,2365.129,Not quite there yet.,33,,
399,0.97,2366.464,2367.631,Yeah.,34,,
400,0.97,2367.631,2380.111,So this is also again part of the 2018 Council ordinance for us to provide a balance of our Unprogrammed funds for you on an annual basis.,34,,
401,0.97,2380.111,2388.619,I just want to call folks' attention to some exciting work that we have with Seattle city light right now.,34,,
402,0.97,2388.619,2393.424,We in 2020 issued a call for an artist in residence.,34,,
403,0.97,2393.424,2403.534,"The artist in residence is going to be working, Seattle city light has been such fantastic partners in this establishing a steering committee.",34,,
404,0.97,2403.534,2412.443,And the artist of residence will be developing a plan for strategic investments for city light 1% funds.,34,,
405,0.97,2412.443,2417.047,And so that artist was just selected and this work is really starting.,34,,
406,0.97,2417.047,2420.985,The artist in residence model--it's not new by any means.,34,,
407,0.97,2420.985,2439.236,It's one of those really effective ways of Imbedding an artist within our partner agencies that can work across Capitol project managers and really thinking creatively about how public art can be Stewarded in the process.,34,,
408,0.97,2439.236,2450.748,"So we're confident that the Unprogrammed dollars, just with the excitement of Seattle city light will be spent pretty shortly over the next couple years.",34,,
409,0.97,2450.748,2455.986,"Also Seattle public utilities, you'll notice a pretty significant jump there.",34,,
410,0.97,2455.986,2459.29,That's because of the ship canal.,34,,
411,0.97,2459.29,2465.696,So ship Canal has kind of infused our coffers with quite a bit of money there.,34,,
412,0.97,2465.696,2479.009,"We've been in really thoughtful discussions with Spu, they have a design and innovation lab where their staff is really building on their fantastic environmental and equity work.",34,,
413,0.97,2479.009,2495.025,"How can we use those dollars and think about strategic investments in equity areas, so that even though that money is coming from ship Canal, what does it look like for that investment to be felt outside of walling Ford valor?",34,,
414,0.97,2495.025,2503.334,So we're really excited to work through that because of the success of flow as a great indicator for that.,34,,
415,0.97,2503.334,2513.143,"You'll also notice for Seattle Department of transportation, a rather large balance that's from the move Seattle levy dollars.",34,,
416,0.97,2513.143,2516.18,And we're working with our partners at Sdot now.,34,,
417,0.97,2516.18,2520.084,They're actually our primary supporters of created comments.,34,,
418,0.97,2520.084,2528.392,So they've been doing some really fantastic work around what they're calling their reset focus geography.,34,,
419,0.97,2528.392,2551.982,"So layering the priorities of the city's race and social index with Covid rates and really they were the ones that generated their kind of focused Geographies, as an entry point to engage with the community to have that conversation around what they want for future investment of 1% in our right of way.",34,,
420,0.97,2551.982,2558.255,So we're really hopeful in thinking about the next couple years as how do we do our work a little bit differently.,34,,
421,0.97,2558.255,2563.794,And this isn't just for us as the Seattle public art program.,34,,
422,0.97,2563.794,2571.235,But I think what you're seeing nationally is understanding public art to be responsive to the cultural times we're in.,34,,
423,0.97,2571.235,2573.304,We have to think differently about our work.,34,,
424,0.97,2573.304,2580.711,"So I'm confident to say that we--we are--all of our city agencies, that's kind of how we're leading with this.",34,,
425,0.97,2580.711,2588.485,How do we not immediately kind of come into that with a Prescope project.,34,,
426,0.97,2588.485,2592.456,But reevaluating where those investments go.,34,,
427,0.97,2592.456,2593.958,"Collandra, did you want to add anything in",34,,
428,0.97,2593.958,2609.006,"No, I think you hit all the points in terms of our planning and strategy around Partnering with our Capitol partners within the city, and continuing to work on moving the public art program forward.",35,,
429,0.97,2611.976,2613.844,Fantastic.,36,,
430,0.97,2613.844,2614.478,Thank you.,36,,
431,0.97,2614.478,2614.745,So much.,36,,
432,0.97,2614.745,2619.55,I have a couple quick questions before I open it up to my colleagues.,36,,
433,0.97,2619.55,2642.473,"The first one just really quickly is if you could give an example of--I mean when I think about Sdot, a partnership with Sdot it's really easy to imagine that's art painted on the street or, you know, on the sidewalk, what does it look like for city light if you have some example of something that's all ready been done there?",36,,
434,0.97,2642.473,2655.319,But then I'm wondering if you can talk just a minute about--I want to understand the economic impact of the public art program.,36,,
435,0.97,2655.319,2670.901,"Not necessarily exclusively in terms of the city and what, you know, what we can--what it means for attracting people to come visit the city and all of that, but really about like the impact that you're actually having on commissioning individual artists.",36,,
436,0.97,2670.901,2679.209,"Because I think as Amy said, they are very often small businesses.",36,,
437,0.97,2679.209,2699.93,"Some the artists I've known, former musicians don't necessarily understand the need to also be a business manager, you know, they'll give away their art and not really understand the need to run your art program like a business so that you can actually try to make some kind of a living off of it.",36,,
438,0.97,2699.93,2702.766,So can you talk a little bit about that?,36,,
439,0.97,2702.766,2708.839,And if those are the kinds of resources that you might have available?,36,,
440,0.97,2708.839,2710.274,"Yeah, those are great questions.",37,,
441,0.97,2710.274,2713.343,So I'll start with the first one.,37,,
442,0.97,2713.343,2719.85,So we do have some slightly different requirements when it comes to our utility funding.,37,,
443,0.97,2719.85,2722.453,Our utility 1% for art funding.,37,,
444,0.97,2722.453,2921.184,So our other 1% art funding that comes from parks or Sdot is really very much about proximity to shift that thinking entirely.,37,,
445,0.97,2921.184,2926.089,They have a portfolio of land as well.,37,,
446,0.97,2926.089,2928.959,Really Thinkingabout that different use.,37,,
447,0.97,2928.959,2931.228,All rise is a fantastic example of that.,37,,
448,0.97,2931.228,2952.816,"To your other thoughtful question around the kind of economic nexus, I think what we're really kind of early data we're getting from just this last weekend in Hinghay the July work we're doing with the welcome back weeks, we're hiring 200 artists and Creatives within that period of time.",37,,
449,0.97,2952.816,2958.555,And we've heard from small businesses in the Cid that they felt a rise across the weekend programming in sales.,37,,
450,0.97,2958.555,2977.974,"And I think that's a great kind of way, kind of circling back around what I would like to do as the new public art director is understanding how we track Metrics more closely to tell that narrative and story around how art creates that place.",37,,
451,0.97,2977.974,2980.177,"Because you know, you can feel it.",37,,
452,0.97,2980.177,2983.046,You can--you know it.,37,,
453,0.97,2983.046,2991.455,But that's something that we're interested in being able to tell our story further.,37,,
454,0.97,2991.455,2995.025,Thank you.,38,,
455,0.97,2995.025,3000.998,"Colleagues, any other questions from--for our panelists here?",38,,
456,0.97,3000.998,3005.736,I'm not seeing any raised hands.,38,,
457,0.97,3005.736,3010.607,For okay.,38,,
458,0.97,3010.607,3010.841,Great.,38,,
459,0.97,3010.841,3018.115,"Well, I want to thank you both for being here and sharing so many great examples of the work that you're doing.",38,,
460,0.97,3018.115,3027.357,"It's really inspiring and, you know, I think really--a really important part of what our city is doing for many different reasons.",38,,
461,0.97,3027.357,3030.761,"So welcome aboard, Amy, nice to see you again.",38,,
462,0.97,3030.761,3032.662,And we look forward to hearing more.,38,,
463,0.97,3032.896,3043.473,"Thank you so much, council member, and if I can just add a quick plug, also part of the public art program is the arts at King Street station gallery.",39,,
464,0.97,3043.473,3046.843,And we're reopening since we've been closed in March of 2020.,39,,
465,0.97,3046.843,3047.844,We're reopening this Thursday.,39,,
466,0.97,3047.844,3056.019,"So it's going to be reopening with a brand new exhibition called ""close to home"" that features works from the civic collection.",39,,
467,0.97,3056.019,3059.389,Some of the pieces you saw sprinkled throughout.,39,,
468,0.97,3059.389,3063.727,And we're just really thrilled to welcome folks back in to see art for free.,39,,
469,0.97,3063.727,3064.694,And showcase that space.,39,,
470,0.97,3064.694,3069.366,So we hope to see you all there.,39,,
471,0.97,3069.366,3069.9,Sounds terrific.,40,,
472,0.97,3069.9,3070.934,Thank you so much.,40,,

488,0.97,3136.266,3141.204,I know it's been a long time since the music Commission was fully seated.,42,,
489,0.97,3141.204,3145.075,So I'm happy that we can get closer to that today.,42,,
490,0.97,3145.075,3155.185,"And my understanding is that by the next meeting on August 12th, we'll be able to complete seating the Commission by the end of the summer.",42,,
