114,0.97,550.716,562.728,"What we do have some slight problems with some of the language not--problems that wouldn't change the legislation per se, but needs some clarification.",20,,
115,0.97,562.728,572.305,So we look forward to working with your office Council member Strauss to possibly add in some clarification in the language.,20,,

123,0.97,607.807,610.209,We strongly support this legislation.,22,,
124,0.97,610.209,614.013,As mentioned earlier the Northwest progressive Institute did a poll in July 2021.,22,,
125,0.97,614.013,624.223,It was done by change research with 617 voters involved and has the confidence level of 95%.,22,,
126,0.97,624.223,636.135,It showed 77% of the respondents supported a provision to require tree care providers to meet minimum certification and training and register with the city.,22,,
127,0.97,636.135,641.741,Only had 14% oppose and 8% unsure.,22,,
128,0.97,641.741,645.945,I agree with Mike Ruby that it would be good to combine this with Sdot.,22,,
129,0.97,645.945,658.658,In other words rather than Duplicating efforts just have the Arborist sign off on which service they would like to provide and we'll provide you with more comments.,22,,
130,0.97,658.658,658.924,Thank you.,22,,

141,0.97,683.616,691.957,And especially the new hazardous tree regulation should follow tree risk assessment qualification methods.,24,,
142,0.97,691.957,703.102,"The proposed legislation wonderfully NOTE shadows urban forestry and the history of environmental in justice with widespread class and disparities with urban heat, Island heat.",24,,
143,0.97,703.102,708.474,The city is experiencing numerous losses both through land subdivision and development crosses.,24,,
144,0.97,708.474,721.32,"Why, however, are members of this land use committee supporting statewide housing legislation that would take away the city's ability to both protect its trees during development and enforce the tree protection of the precious Emerald forest.",24,,
145,0.97,721.32,734.066,Why can't we have both more affordable housing and also protect our tree Canopies to help mitigate the catastrophic climate change impact and improve the quality of living in Seattle.,24,,
146,0.97,734.066,734.333,Thank you.,24,,

155,0.97,761.594,765.164,Trees can actually increase the value of a property.,27,,
156,0.97,765.164,769.101,So often in Seattle exceptional trees are cut down illegally.,27,,
157,0.97,769.101,778.744,"It happened almost a year ago in my neighborhood, a majestic healthy 100-Year-Old Cedar was cut down and removed.",27,,
158,0.97,778.744,782.414,There was an orange Sdci stop work order posted in full view.,27,,
159,0.97,782.414,791.056,When this happened I and many other concerned citizens believe a permit should be revoked or never granted.,27,,
160,0.97,791.056,792.258,"A fine of $90,000 has not been paid.",27,,
161,0.97,792.258,796.128,But a very small tree was just planted.,27,,
162,0.97,796.128,800.9,How can an exceptional tree be replaced?,27,,
163,0.97,800.9,804.97,I also agree about the Sdot joining.,27,,

171,0.97,852.518,859.625,It is a simple and based on the contract regulation slightly used including urban forestry.,29,,
172,0.97,859.625,869.735,"Registration will educate the companies on our rules, save valuable staff time and responding to crisis caused by illegal tree work and Removals.",29,,
173,0.97,869.735,880.679,Enable code enforcement to hold accountable Tsps of northern rules and protect property owners by holding them responsible for adhering to those rules on what can and cannot be done.,29,,
174,0.97,880.679,884.783,Public notice will help property owners and the public understand the rules.,29,,
175,0.97,884.783,890.923,The eyes on the street and the trees will make sure the rules are followed and trees protected.,29,,

189,0.97,945.044,951.317,"It doesn't really inform the whole neighborhood, and we have a big side.",31,,

201,0.97,987.219,996.128,I'm afraid I was alerted to my ability to comment just a half hour ago.,33,,
202,0.97,996.128,1006.772,"I am in Tremont and currently trying to protect exceptional trees and exceptional tree growth on Seattle public school property, which is private property as well.",33,,
203,0.97,1006.772,1024.757,I would like Council member Strauss to look into what's happening at the elementary school to exceptional tree growth and trees individually due to parks renovation of a playground.,33,,
204,0.97,1024.757,1026.191,They're trying to do maintenance.,33,,

206,0.97,1041.14,1045.644,I did so from the sidewalk.,33,,
207,0.97,1045.644,1046.578,Thank you.,33,,

211,0.97,1054.686,1063.262,"This is Suzanne grant, and we have waited years to save Seattle trees, so please adopt the Council bill.",35,,
212,0.97,1063.262,1071.837,"These simple standards were promised two years ago, which calls for requiring all tree service providers to meet minimum certification and training requirement, and register with the city.",35,,
213,0.97,1071.837,1082.681,"In order to operate a business in Seattle as a music teacher, I have to have a license and register with the city, and my job doesn't involve removing life given trees to provide health benefits.",35,,
214,0.97,1082.681,1092.357,"Not only for residents of the property on which the trees are located, but they provide more air, shade, and grounding the community as a whole.",35,,
215,0.97,1092.357,1096.028,I urge you to adopt all three amendments for Council member Pedersen.,35,,
216,0.97,1096.028,1101.834,We need to make sure we're protecting our exceptional trees.,35,,
217,0.97,1101.834,1104.269,Sometimes erroneously identify this as hazardous.,35,,
218,0.97,1104.269,1109.775,Should maximize conservation of existing trees by requiring subdivisions to be prepared qualified.,35,,
219,0.97,1109.775,1110.776,Have you heard of pro?,35,,
220,0.97,1110.776,1115.447,It is the simplest and most effective way of mitigating climate change.,35,,
221,0.97,1115.447,1121.854,It means leaving older trees in the ground is way more valuable than planting new ones.,35,,
222,0.97,1121.854,1123.455,Please adopt the tree amendment.,35,,
223,0.97,1123.455,1127.392,"Thank you, Suzanne, always great to hear from you.",36,,

228,0.97,1136.034,1140.639,"I think we all got it sent to our junk mail, which is why none of us are on yet.",37,,
229,0.97,1140.639,1143.242,"But thank you, and I will be quick.",37,,
230,0.97,1143.242,1152.184,I wanted to just Express support for Alex Pedersen's amendment as well and thank you Dan and Alex for doing this bill.,37,,
231,0.97,1152.184,1156.021,We lost Western Hemlock about two years ago on our street.,37,,
232,0.97,1156.021,1169.368,"They were cutting it down, a bunch of neighbors and Komo-Tv came, and everybody was concerned about the tree, but a report came out that said it had Woody, and it was diseased and hazardous and had to go.",37,,
233,0.97,1169.368,1181.78,"So they cut the tree down, the TV crew went away, and it turned out that is like a mild case of Acne that some suffer from it, but it was really nothing.",37,,
234,0.97,1181.78,1187.452,So terrible Misdiagnosis.,37,,
235,0.97,1187.452,1193.025,If you think a case of Acne could condemn a patient.,37,,
236,0.97,1193.025,1193.525,Okay.,37,,
237,0.97,1193.659,1194.059,"Thank you, sandy.",38,,
238,0.97,1194.059,1216.782,And I would be Remised to not share what you have taught me in something that I will keep my eye on as we discuss the tree ordinance is ensuring trees that are planted receive the attention and nourishment they need to survive and grow and thrive when new trees are planted new residents take a hold.,38,,
239,0.97,1216.782,1220.252,They don't know they need to care for their Street trees in the way they do.,38,,
240,0.97,1220.252,1231.697,That was me trying to buy some time to see if Jessica Dixon or Julia Shettler have found the caller line in their span.,38,,
241,0.97,1231.697,1231.897,Mr.,38,,
242,0.97,1231.897,1238.303,"G, do we have any further public comment registrants present at this time?",38,,
243,0.97,1238.303,1243.208,"Negative, there are no further public comment registrants.",39,,
244,0.97,1243.208,1243.475,Great.,40,,
245,0.97,1243.475,1250.015,"Well as I slow walk closing this out, if they join, please do interrupt me.",40,,
246,0.97,1250.015,1259.625,"Seeing as we have no additional speakers remotely present, we will move on to the next agenda item.",40,,
247,0.97,1259.625,1263.862,"D, items of business.",40,,
248,0.97,1263.862,1271.036,"Our first agenda item is Council bill 120253, Floodplains.",40,,
249,0.97,1271.036,1274.94,Please read the previous title.,40,,
250,0.97,1274.94,1290.155,"Item 1, council bill 120253, an ordinance relating to Floodplains, second extension of interim regulations established by ordinance for six months to allow vines to rely on updated national flood insurance rate maps to obtain flood insurance.",41,,
251,0.97,1290.155,1290.756,"Wonderful, thank you.",42,,
252,0.97,1290.756,1296.128,And this is an extension of a bill that we have previously passed.,42,,
253,0.97,1296.128,1303.201,"We are joined for this briefing by representatives from Sdci, council central staff.",42,,
254,0.97,1303.201,1310.242,Last thing on public comment and for the other members of the committee as you've noticed we have moved to afternoon meetings rather than morning meetings.,42,,
255,0.97,1310.242,1316.481,You can see my energy level is a little bit different when I've had lunch and not just coffee all day.,42,,
256,0.97,1316.481,1320.686,So hopefully you'll enjoy a little bit more energetic committee.,42,,
257,0.97,1320.686,1326.191,With that we are joined by representatives from Sdci and Council central staff.,42,,
258,0.97,1326.191,1332.831,Will you please introduce yourselves and kick us off?,42,,
259,0.97,1332.831,1336.001,Ketil Freeman Council central staff.,43,,
260,0.97,1336.001,1339.304,"Maggie Glowacki, Sdci, and the environmental planner.",44,,
261,0.97,1339.304,1344.209,I will say a few words and turn it over to Maggie who has a presentation to walk through.,45,,
262,0.97,1344.209,1346.545,The title of the bill speaks for itself.,45,,
263,0.97,1346.545,1362.561,"This bill would extend for six months, interim Floodplain development regulations that were initially put in place in the summer of 2020 through ordinance 126113, those in the Floodplain regulation.",45,,
264,0.97,1362.561,1370.569,And action by the Council on a permanent regulation has been stalled because of a seat appeal filed by the board of Seattle.,45,,
265,0.97,1370.569,1377.042,Maggie will remind you a little bit about what this regulation is and talk about the next steps here.,45,,
266,0.97,1377.175,1379.845,Good afternoon chair staff and committee members.,46,,
267,0.97,1379.845,1383.248,Thank you for your time this afternoon.,46,,
268,0.97,1383.248,1397.829,And I've prepared a power point presentation to provide information regarding this second extension of the Floodplain regulations.,46,,
269,0.97,1397.829,1414.546,"So this afternoon I'm going to provide an overview of the interim Floodplain development regulations, explain the reasons for the second extension.",46,,
270,0.97,1414.546,1419.251,Also talk about the proposed amendment to these interim regulations.,46,,
271,0.97,1419.251,1423.155,Public outreach today and next steps.,46,,
272,0.97,1423.155,1436.768,So an overview of the interim regulation is that in July of 2020 city council passed the first interim regulations that established these updated Floodplain regulations.,46,,
273,0.97,1436.768,1447.612,These were for six months and so in January of 2021 another ordinance was passed that extended those interim regulations for one year.,46,,
274,0.97,1447.612,1456.121,"And so these regulations contain billing codes and other standards that makes homes, businesses, people safer from flooding.",46,,
275,0.97,1456.121,1465.63,And they also apply to permit applications for construction on properties within these Max Floodplain areas.,46,,
276,0.97,1465.63,1473.805,"So the regulations come from the Federal, from the Federal Emergency Management agency also known as FEMA.",46,,
277,0.97,1473.805,1483.682,So they produce the updated Floodplain maps and FEMA also establishes the minimum required standards for Floodplain regulations.,46,,
278,0.97,1483.682,1487.285,These current interim regulations are due to expire February 22.,46,,
279,0.97,1487.285,1500.232,"If the regulations are not extended, then property owners in these FEMA Floodplain areas will not be able to purchase flood insurance or extend their existing policies if they are set to expire.",46,,
280,0.97,1500.232,1511.61,"And a reason for the extension is that Sdci drafted permanent Floodplain development regulations, and we completed these in June of 202 1.",46,,
281,0.97,1511.61,1517.782,We published the decision on this proposal on July of 2021.,46,,
282,0.97,1517.782,1524.923,And this decision was appealed by the board of Seattle on July 29.,46,,
283,0.97,1524.923,1535.734,Since August of 2021 Sdci staff and city staff has been working with the port to resolve the issues raised for the appeal.,46,,
284,0.97,1535.734,1545.71,And then also included with the second extension of the interim regulations is we're proposing one amendment to address a Codrafting error.,46,,
285,0.97,1545.71,1557.689,So the standards for the elevation for Non-Residential structures constructed above the base elevation was unintentionally reduced from two feet to one foot.,46,,
286,0.97,1557.689,1565.83,And this area has resulted in a lower standard of protection for the past 18 months.,46,,
287,0.97,1565.83,1575.974,"The intent of the regulation was to keep that standard at two feet, which was the standard prior to the interim regulations.",46,,
288,0.97,1575.974,1580.712,So this amendment is found in section 25.06.110.,46,,
289,0.97,1580.712,1584.349,So now I'm going to cover public outreach completed today.,46,,
290,0.97,1584.349,1591.489,We do have a web page up and running and this has been up and running since 2020.,46,,
291,0.97,1591.489,1603.234,"We also have, or we also mailed out 2,400 postcards to the property owners in these map Floodplain areas.",46,,
292,0.97,1603.234,1609.04,"We have 1,100 subscribers to our flood plane regulations update E-mail serve.",46,,
293,0.97,1609.04,1620.185,"And on April 27, 2021, we held a public meeting and a recording of this meeting is available on our Website.",46,,
294,0.97,1620.185,1624.122,Our next steps include continue working with the port to resolve the appeal issues.,46,,
295,0.97,1624.122,1641.406,And also to amend the permanent Floodplain development regulations to incorporate the changes that we've discussed with the port as well as any other identified amendments that we would bring forward in the permanent Floodplain regulations.,46,,
296,0.97,1641.406,1653.351,And then we'll bring these regulations to Mayor Harrell for his approval and then to city council for your review and approval.,46,,
297,0.97,1653.351,1659.758,So any questions at this time?,46,,
298,0.97,1659.758,1663.561,I do not have questions.,47,,
299,0.97,1663.561,1668.7,"Maggie, that is a product of me seeing this bill before so many times and meeting with you to decide.",47,,
300,0.97,1668.7,1671.336,I do want to check with colleagues.,47,,
301,0.97,1671.336,1675.44,"Colleagues, do you have questions at this time?",47,,
302,0.97,1675.44,1679.878,Reporter: seeing no questions at this time.,48,,
303,0.97,1679.878,1680.979,I see Council member Nelson.,48,,
304,0.97,1680.979,1696.561,"Maybe we could take this Offline, but is there--is it written down anywhere what issues the board has with all of this or do you want to talk about that later?",49,,
305,0.97,1696.561,1701.533,That is regarding the permanent regulations and a temporary extension.,50,,
306,0.97,1701.533,1702.033,"Okay, Nevermind.",51,,
307,0.97,1702.033,1703.568,Let's talk about that.,52,,
308,0.97,1703.568,1708.94,And there is a process with the hearing Examiner where they will provide a fair amount of information.,53,,
309,0.97,1708.94,1709.441,There's a whole process.,53,,
310,0.97,1709.574,1712.177,"Okay, thanks.",54,,
311,0.97,1712.477,1714.746,Great question.,55,,
312,0.97,1718.016,1723.221,Any others on the temporary??,55,,
313,0.97,1723.221,1724.122,Stellar.,55,,
314,0.97,1724.122,1742.974,"I mean for the good of the order, and to be adopted in order to avoid a gap in legislation.",55,,
315,0.97,1742.974,1751.249,"To the current interim regulations are due to expire February 22, 2022.",56,,
316,0.97,1751.249,1751.616,Okay.,57,,
317,0.97,1751.75,1758.923,And when does this need to be adopted to avoid that gap?,58,,
318,0.97,1758.923,1767.599,So prior to that time and then it needs to go to the Mayor for his signature.,59,,
319,0.97,1767.599,1768.333,Thank you.,60,,
320,0.97,1768.333,1781.746,So I am not utilizing my standard practice in having this because we have seen this legislation in our Committee a few times before.,60,,
321,0.97,1781.746,1788.219,And what consequences could result if the city did not maintain these regulations?,60,,
322,0.97,1788.219,1811.676,"So we would no longer qualify for the national flood insurance programs, so those property owners that have property within the map Floodplain areas wouldn't be able to Reup their flood insurance if it were to expire during any gap where the interim regulations were in place.",61,,
323,0.97,1811.676,1826.457,"So if anybody were selling property, they will also not be able to gain flood insurance in order to get a federally backed mortgage.",61,,
324,0.97,1826.457,1828.159,So large consequences?,62,,
325,0.97,1828.159,1828.459,Thank you.,62,,
326,0.97,1828.459,1829.027,That's helpful.,62,,
327,0.97,1829.027,1834.365,"Colleagues, any other questions before we open up the public hearing?",62,,
328,0.97,1834.365,1834.666,Seeing none.,62,,
329,0.97,1834.666,1843.541,"Before we open the remote public hearing, I ask everyone to please be patient as we continue to learn to operate this new system in real time and navigate through the inevitable growing pains.",62,,
330,0.97,1843.541,1851.449,We're continuing to look for ways to fine tune this process and add in New features to allow for additional means of public participation in our Council meetings.,62,,

350,0.97,1939.137,1950.248,In 1911 the port of Seattle was authorized by the residence of King County to serve as the public port authority charged with ensuring the harbor is protected to serve as a vital economic region.,63,,
351,0.97,1950.248,1964.195,"Our port, which now includes the alliance is a partner for cargo and it counts for more than $1 billion in public investments and generates 83,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in annual payroll.",63,,
352,0.97,1964.195,1967.265,Our fishing operations are vital to the health of the economy.,63,,
353,0.97,1967.265,1976.641,As such we have a strong interest in the flood plane regulations do not create unnecessary Straints or significant unintended consequences.,63,,
354,0.97,1976.641,1990.755,"As one of the largest waterfront landowners, we share the school of the Environmental protection to that end the port has developed a shoreline program that will replace with more resilient to greener alternatives.",63,,
355,0.97,1990.755,2000.031,We've also implemented a climbing plan that will require us to be carbon neutral by 2040 and invest in habitat restoration.,63,,
356,0.97,2000.031,2005.236,We are proud to be in the leading edge when it comes to adaptation of the city.,63,,
357,0.97,2005.236,2015.213,Our concern is Floodplain regulations do not consider impacts on existing and critical dependent and related public infrastructure and will cause outcomes in some cases.,63,,
358,0.97,2015.213,2029.961,"We've been working with city staff over the last year and made progress, but there are still unresolved significant issues regarding regulatory interpretations that are beyond FEMA minimum standards, which don't make sense.",63,,
359,0.97,2029.961,2038.102,For example regulations will require entire existing structures to be elevated even when only small new structures were added.,63,,
360,0.97,2038.102,2046.577,They impose Expansionive development standards to improvements in the Floodplains that are not required by FEMA creating uncertainty in the development process.,63,,
361,0.97,2046.577,2057.388,They create conservative forces on a number of waterfront property owners when the city existing adjacent infrastructure such as the way would not accommodate the proposed new requirements.,63,,
362,0.97,2057.388,2065.296,And the current proposal to address all future waterfront construction through the process is a work solution.,63,,
363,0.97,2065.296,2067.632,Extremely restrictive and are suppose to be rare.,63,,
364,0.97,2067.632,2075.606,"And please if you could bring Joseph back, I know--I just have a question for Joseph.",64,,
365,0.97,2075.606,2083.214,"Joseph, are those comments in regards to the permanent regulations or the temporary extension?",64,,
366,0.97,2083.214,2089.22,"And you'll have to Unmute yourself again, Joseph.",64,,
367,0.97,2089.52,2100.965,"Okay, I think I'm Unmuted at this stage.",65,,
368,0.97,2100.965,2103.201,"There you are, Yep, we got you.",66,,
369,0.97,2103.201,2108.306,Were they in relation to the temporary extension or the permanent regulations?,66,,
370,0.97,2108.306,2109.407,The permanent regulations.,67,,
371,0.97,2109.407,2112.343,"Great, do you have comments about the temporary extension?",68,,
372,0.97,2112.343,2116.247,That's what the public hearing is about today.,68,,
373,0.97,2116.38,2117.615,Not that.,69,,
374,0.97,2117.615,2121.919,We just wanted to provide a picture of the long term.,69,,
375,0.97,2121.919,2122.353,The dialogue.,69,,
376,0.97,2122.353,2128.226,"And that is a process that is currently occurring with the hearing Examiner, is that my correct understanding?",70,,
377,0.97,2128.359,2133.664,"That is one aspect of the dialogue, yes.",71,,
378,0.97,2133.664,2135.5,"Okay, Joseph, last question here.",72,,
379,0.97,2135.5,2140.338,Do you have comments regarding the temporary extension?,72,,
380,0.97,2140.338,2141.239,Not the temporary extension.,73,,
381,0.97,2141.372,2142.34,Okay.,74,,
382,0.97,2142.34,2147.478,In the past has the port supported or opposed the temporary extension?,74,,
383,0.97,2147.612,2156.12,"We have not, no, not for the interim regulations.",75,,
384,0.97,2156.12,2160.458,"Okay, does the port of Seattle has a position on the temporary extension?",76,,
385,0.97,2160.458,2160.658,No.,77,,
386,0.97,2160.791,2162.393,Okay.,78,,
387,0.97,2162.393,2164.996,Thank you.,78,,
388,0.97,2164.996,2170.835,This was a public hearing in regards to the temporary extension of the Floodplain regulations.,78,,
389,0.97,2170.835,2171.035,Mr.,78,,
390,0.97,2171.035,2176.007,"G, can you confirm there are no more public hearing registrants present?",78,,
391,0.97,2176.007,2178.276,There are no more public hearing registrants.,79,,
392,0.97,2178.409,2181.078,Thank you.,80,,
393,0.97,2181.078,2186.05,That was our last Speaker remotely present to speak at the public hearing.,80,,
394,0.97,2186.05,2188.119,Council hearing on 120253 is now closed.,80,,
395,0.97,2188.119,2192.123,Thank you to everyone who provided public comment today.,80,,
396,0.97,2192.123,2212.143,"Colleaues, given the timely nature of this extension and the fact we have adopted these temporary regulations in the past and again the temporary regulations in the first place and an extension in addition to that, I would like to ask that we suspend this to allow us to vote on the same day as a public hearing.",80,,
397,0.97,2212.143,2216.147,"Colleagues, I know we've got a couple new members of the committee.",80,,
398,0.97,2216.147,2224.622,Are there any questions before I ask to suspend the rules?,80,,
399,0.97,2224.622,2235.032,"Seeing no questions from my colleagues, I would like to move to suspend the rules to allow us to vote on Council bill 120253 as the same day on the public hearing.",80,,
400,0.97,2235.032,2236.167,Is there a second?,80,,
401,0.97,2236.167,2236.434,Second.,81,,

413,0.97,2266.163,2268.132,Council member Mosqueda?,91,,

433,0.97,2311.809,2312.376,Chair Strauss?,103,,
434,0.97,2312.376,2312.977,Yes.,104,,
435,0.97,2312.977,2315.446,"Five in favor, none opposed.",104,,
436,0.97,2315.446,2316.28,Thank you.,105,,
437,0.97,2316.28,2318.149,Council bill 120253 passes.,105,,
438,0.97,2318.149,2319.317,The motion carries.,105,,
439,0.97,2319.317,2320.051,Thank you all.,105,,
440,0.97,2320.051,2325.589,This legislation will be before the full Council on February 15 for a final vote.,105,,
441,0.97,2325.589,2333.03,"Our next agenda item is Council bill 120207, which would establish a tree service provider Registry.",105,,
442,0.97,2333.03,2337.702,Will you please read the abbreviated title into the record?,105,,
443,0.97,2337.702,2350.815,"Agenda 2, council bill 120207, an ordinance relating to land use and urban forestry adding a tree service provider registration procedure and requirement.",106,,
444,0.97,2350.815,2354.752,"Wonderful, I'm happy to be Co-Sponsoring this legislation with Council member Pedersen.",107,,
445,0.97,2354.752,2357.955,"I see Council member Pedersen has his sign, and I keep mine.",107,,
446,0.97,2357.955,2361.759,"I know we keep them both in the window, but here we go.",107,,
447,0.97,2361.759,2366.163,I hope everyone is enjoying the higher level of energy in these afternoon meetings.,107,,
448,0.97,2366.163,2371.168,"And so Yeah, I'm Co-Sponsoring Council member Pedersen is a co-sponsor.",107,,
449,0.97,2371.168,2378.275,I will like to give you the floor and then I've got some comments about the tree ordinance at large.,107,,
450,0.97,2378.275,2379.043,Take it away.,107,,
451,0.97,2379.176,2379.777,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",108,,
452,0.97,2379.777,2384.648,Thank you for the opportunity to have this bill considered at your first meeting of 2022.,108,,
453,0.97,2384.648,2400.765,So we can take this small step to increase transparency and accountability by simply having tree service providers register with the city before they cut down or heavily prune more trees.,108,,
454,0.97,2400.765,2412.576,And I'm very appreciative of your Co-Sponsorship and your ongoing efforts to update Seattle's more comprehensive tree protection ordinance.,108,,
455,0.97,2412.576,2418.649,"While this Council bill is a small step towards protecting Seattle's precious tree candy, it is important and overdue.",108,,
456,0.97,2418.649,2430.161,It is the least we could do to ensure those professionals who are authorized to cut down our heavily pruning existing trees are registered with the city.,108,,
457,0.97,2430.161,2442.273,The Council bill 120207 also happens to be a fairly simple step because it's an administrative action setting up an Online Registry for tree service providers performing commercial tree work.,108,,
458,0.97,2442.273,2448.112,So it does not require additional process under the state environmental policy act.,108,,
459,0.97,2448.112,2472.403,During the horrible Heatwaves last year we saw once again the negative impacts to communities that have seen a loss of tree candy and experienced horrible heat Island effects increasing transparency by registering those cut down the heavily tune trees should improve compliance with current and future protection of Seattle's trees and help those neighborhoods most at risk of losing more trees.,108,,
460,0.97,2472.403,2484.982,I really want to thank the dozens of tree advocates who already know very well the environmental and health benefits of existing nature of trees and steadfastly urge city Council to do more about the city's dwindling tree canopy.,108,,
461,0.97,2484.982,2491.388,And just this week we received over 100 E-Mails asking us to pass this Council bill.,108,,
462,0.97,2491.388,2505.803,"I think those who took the time to call in public comment today including Seattle Audubon and tree pack, you've heard from many of these same supporters in the meeting for the past several months.",108,,
463,0.97,2505.803,2511.809,"As Steve noted, a survey conducted last year shows 77% support a registration system like this.",108,,
464,0.97,2511.809,2514.378,"So let's get it done, and thank you chair Strauss.",108,,
465,0.97,2514.512,2518.983,"Thank you, council member Pedersen.",109,,
466,0.97,2518.983,2535.833,"I will state in our last committee meeting where we had Sdci present discussing the tremendous ordinance at large, we had received commitment to have the decision published for the overall tree ordinance.",109,,
467,0.97,2535.833,2540.271,"This tree registration, the Arborist registration is one aspect of the larger more comprehensive bill.",109,,
468,0.97,2540.271,2543.807,It will be my preference to have that decision published.,109,,
469,0.97,2543.807,2550.214,I will keep working with you Council member Pedersen to hopefully get that decision published as soon as possible.,109,,
470,0.97,2550.214,2556.32,I think we should endeavor in this bill and down the road of this bill.,109,,
471,0.97,2556.32,2564.495,I will say just from the outset I do think it will create better policy to have it as a comprehensive package.,109,,
472,0.97,2564.495,2570.768,With that I will hold my comments and questions for Yolanda's presentation.,109,,
473,0.97,2570.768,2576.941,We are joined by Yolanda of Council central staff for this briefing.,109,,
474,0.97,2576.941,2581.478,For the general public and for colleagues as well.,109,,
475,0.97,2581.478,2591.588,"Usually this Committee, I believe this might be one of the first times other than bringing business own bill that is Council generated.",109,,
476,0.97,2591.588,2599.63,Most of the legislation at land use committee receives is generated by the departments.,109,,
477,0.97,2599.63,2603.2,And so we typically and almost always have Department registration.,109,,
478,0.97,2603.2,2607.504,Today we do not because this is a Council generated bill.,109,,
479,0.97,2607.504,2612.209,So just for Archest a awareness it is a slight difference to be normal.,109,,
480,0.97,2612.209,2615.612,"With that Yolanda of Council central staff, thank you for your briefing.",109,,
481,0.97,2615.612,2616.146,Please take it away.,109,,
482,0.97,2616.146,2620.117,"All right, for the record Yolanda Council central staff.",110,,
483,0.97,2620.117,2627.758,And we will commence sharing my screen.,110,,
484,0.97,2627.758,2631.095,"And that will be to you, chair.",110,,
485,0.97,2631.228,2631.595,"Yes, it does.",111,,
486,0.97,2631.595,2632.129,All right.,112,,
487,0.97,2632.129,2647.344,"So today we will be, what I will be doing is describing Council bill 120207 that would establish a requirement that tree service providers register with the city prior to conducting commercial tree work on private property.",112,,
488,0.97,2647.344,2660.157,"I will go over the background of the legislation to describe the legislation itself including a comparison with the city's existing tree service provider Registry, which a member of public Commenters noted.",112,,
489,0.97,2660.157,2663.127,And potential impacts of the proposal.,112,,
490,0.97,2663.127,2666.63,"After this formal presentation, there will be some proposed amendments to discuss.",112,,
491,0.97,2666.63,2682.78,And so in terms of background in 2019 the Council adopted resolution 31902 stating the Council and Mayor's shared commitment to explore increase Seattle's tree canopy cover.,112,,
492,0.97,2682.78,2693.957,This resolution included a list of priority strategies including that all tree service providers in Seattle be required to meet minimum certification and training requirements and register with the city.,112,,
493,0.97,2693.957,2701.265,The Seattle Department of transportation already requires that tree service providers register prior to conducting tree work in the public right of way.,112,,
494,0.97,2701.265,2708.372,This was created nearly ten years ago as part of a more comprehensive effort to approve management of Street trees.,112,,
495,0.97,2708.372,2715.145,It's a fairly simple system staffed by one person in Sdot's forestry team.,112,,
496,0.97,2715.145,2719.983,I will describe the registration requirements in more detail later in the presentation.,112,,
497,0.97,2719.983,2725.355,Currently there is no requirement for tree service providers to register with the city prior to doing tree work.,112,,
498,0.97,2725.355,2735.933,So it will be describing some general previsions of Council member 120207.,112,,
499,0.97,2735.933,2740.571,As I mentioned a comparison of the requirements with Sdot's Registry on the next slide.,112,,
500,0.97,2740.571,2756.353,This legislation would amend the Seattle municipal code title 25 to require that the Seattle Department of construction and inspections also known as Sdci will establish a Registry process and system within 90 days of the effective date of the ordinance.,112,,
501,0.97,2756.353,2763.393,Tree service providers would then have 90 days to register with Sdci following this setup period.,112,,
502,0.97,2763.393,2776.44,It would define commercial tree work as conducting major pruning removal of trees larger than six inches in diameter and the assessment of tree health or hazardous risk for financial compensation.,112,,
503,0.97,2776.44,2781.111,This does exclude routine to these that do not meet the threshold of major pruning.,112,,
504,0.97,2781.111,2788.118,"It would define tree service provider as an entity, any entity engaged in commercial tree work.",112,,
505,0.97,2788.118,2806.336,"It would require register tree service providers comply with best practices related to the type of work force engaged there such as maintaining adequate supervision, as they conduct the work and assessing what appropriate level of true work is needed to meet their clients objectives.",112,,
506,0.97,2806.336,2821.919,They would authorize Sdci to create rules as needed to support notice of the Registry and amend other sections of title 25 to align with the legislation's intent that only registered tree service providers may conduct commercial tree work.,112,,
507,0.97,2821.919,2830.627,And this table finds the comparison between existing tree service providers and the proposed Registry in the legislation.,112,,
508,0.97,2830.627,2844.575,"And so in terms of registration B, Sdot charges no fee and the proposed Registry will be charged no fee not to create a financial disincentive and encourage tree service providers to register.",112,,
509,0.97,2844.575,2846.343,The Journal contractors license is a requirement.,112,,
510,0.97,2846.343,2852.149,That's a state requirement to the contractors that remove trees.,112,,
511,0.97,2852.149,2859.523,The business license is required for all entities engaged in business in Seattle.,112,,
512,0.97,2859.523,2866.063,"In terms of commercial liability insurance, this is required to be licensed as a general contractor with the state.",112,,
513,0.97,2866.063,2870.0,Sdot has some specific requirements due to the nature of the public right of way.,112,,
514,0.97,2870.0,2878.909,And in the legislation they would allow Sdci to set the amount as appropriate for work on private property.,112,,
515,0.97,2878.909,2880.444,International society of culture and the certification.,112,,
516,0.97,2880.444,2890.887,Sdot allows tree service providers to have someone with current Certifications either on staff or retainer.,112,,
517,0.97,2890.887,2892.256,They require someone to be on staff.,112,,
518,0.97,2892.256,2913.577,"In terms of city regulations, Sdot requires that the tree service providers submit an affirmation stating they are aware of the city's regulations regarding tree management in the right of way and list specific documents that the company should be familiar with including Sdot Street tree manual and the street tree ordinance.",112,,
519,0.97,2913.577,2920.55,The proposal would also require information by the tree service provider that they are familiar with the city's tree regulations.,112,,
520,0.97,2920.55,2924.054,This does not provide specific documents.,112,,
521,0.97,2924.054,2930.327,Sdci may want to create similar guidance for tree service providers in the future once this is up and running.,112,,
522,0.97,2930.327,2938.936,"Regards to public notice, Sdot requires at least 14 calendar day notice in advance of tree removal.",112,,
523,0.97,2938.936,2949.746,Note this is a requirement that pertains to both Sdot and maintenance crew and may be involved in tree removal as well as private tree service providers.,112,,
524,0.97,2949.746,2952.349,Sdot provides a template for the notice to be posted.,112,,
525,0.97,2952.349,2958.255,The proposal would require three calendar days notice in advance of major pruning or tree removal.,112,,
526,0.97,2958.255,2967.03,This notice would need to be posted in a location visible from the public right of way.,112,,
527,0.97,2967.03,2974.171,"In terms of penalties, Sdot's current practice, after they have been found of two violations of any type.",112,,
528,0.97,2974.171,2977.708,After a year the company may apply to be registered.,112,,
529,0.97,2977.708,2987.217,This proposal would not allow Sdci to accept any tree related reports submitted by a tree service provider that has been issued.,112,,
530,0.97,2987.217,2997.661,A notice of violation related to the illegal exceptional tree until such notice has been resolved either by withdrawing the notice or the tree service provider paying the fine.,112,,
531,0.97,2997.661,3007.904,I think they would need to determine how they would want to go about implementing the specific provision.,112,,
532,0.97,3007.904,3010.007,And do you have any questions?,112,,
533,0.97,3010.007,3012.809,Would you like us to ask questions?,113,,
534,0.97,3012.809,3014.978,This is where most of my questions are.,113,,
535,0.97,3014.978,3017.314,That is kind of the neat proposal.,114,,
536,0.97,3017.314,3022.386,So I think I would want to pause here to give you all a chance to ask questions.,114,,
537,0.97,3022.519,3025.188,And I--there you go.,115,,
538,0.97,3025.188,3029.459,As the prime sponsor do you want first crack at this?,115,,
539,0.97,3029.459,3032.863,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",116,,
540,0.97,3032.863,3038.268,I am happy--the way the bill is drafted is a reasonable start.,116,,
541,0.97,3038.268,3047.277,So I will just see what questions there are if Yolanda doesn't want to take them I'm happy to take them.,116,,
542,0.97,3047.277,3050.514,I see we have a Cue up of questions.,117,,
543,0.97,3050.514,3065.061,So I will hold my questions to the end and just kind of provide a framework for my colleagues that I would love to see these two columns be as similar in uniform as possible.,117,,
544,0.97,3065.061,3072.836,So I think there are some Specificities that we need to take into consideration regarding the difference between private property and public property.,117,,
545,0.97,3072.836,3084.815,But you will hear my questions amount to can we have the Ias certified Arborist on retainer rather than on a staff.,117,,
546,0.97,3084.815,3094.257,Can we increase the public notice to 14 days and ensure the property owner is posting and not requiring the Arborist to post.,117,,
547,0.97,3094.257,3099.796,And also seeing the penalty to be the same as what is in Sdot.,117,,
548,0.97,3099.796,3103.633,So that is a preview of what my questions will be.,117,,
549,0.97,3103.633,3107.504,I will pass the Mic to vice chair Morales.,117,,
550,0.97,3107.504,3107.838,Take it away.,117,,
551,0.97,3107.838,3112.709,Thank you so much chair Strauss.,118,,
552,0.97,3112.709,3113.243,Good afternoon everybody.,118,,
553,0.97,3113.243,3118.748,I'm excited to be here in this capacity.,118,,
554,0.97,3118.748,3135.632,I want to start by saying I initially read this legislation thinking this was about the broader tree ordinance conversation that we've been having in the city for some time now.,118,,
555,0.97,3135.632,3143.34,So I want to thank chair Strauss and Council member Pedersen for having a quick conversation with me today to give me a little bit of context.,118,,
556,0.97,3143.34,3156.152,"Nevertheless I still have a few things that I wanted to highlight and they were in part due to the memo that you drafted, Yolanda.",118,,
557,0.97,3156.152,3174.07,"It seems to me if the goal here is to protect our tree canopy to increase our tree canopy, which is something I'm very supportive of given excessive heat and the urban heat Island and all the other things we have talked about, the health disparities.",118,,
558,0.97,3174.07,3179.175,This particular piece of legislation doesn't seem to get us there.,118,,
559,0.97,3179.175,3184.114,I understand how this is really about a different aspect of that conversation.,118,,
560,0.97,3184.114,3192.222,"So the Registry is really about just making sure that we know who is doing this work, which I am also fine with.",118,,
561,0.97,3192.222,3212.142,"The question I have is about the potentially disproportionate impact on some businesses particularly Latino businesses, Hispanic businesses who as you mentioned in the memo may have some difficulty meeting the requirements to register their businesses to participate in this kind of work.",118,,
562,0.97,3212.142,3222.385,"And so you know especially if I'm looking here, I don't know what minimum insurance requirements are for this kind of work.",118,,
563,0.97,3222.385,3241.104,So I would just want before we keep moving forward to have a little bit more information about who the businesses are and what kind of impact these requirements would have on their ability to continue to provide service in the city.,118,,
564,0.97,3241.237,3242.872,Thank you vice chair.,119,,
565,0.97,3242.872,3253.483,"Are those questions that you would like, I guess how would you like us to address those questions?",119,,
566,0.97,3253.483,3256.286,Is that something you'd like Yolanda to present you with?,119,,
567,0.97,3256.286,3260.29,My first question is do we have that information?,120,,
568,0.97,3260.29,3265.095,Do we know if that would be the impact?,120,,
569,0.97,3265.095,3271.301,Or what would our press be for trying to understand the impact better?,120,,
570,0.97,3271.301,3276.273,I mean I'm happy to give you some information.,121,,
571,0.97,3276.273,3286.449,"In terms of the general liability insurance, there is a requirement by the state that if there are businesses that are engaged in the removal of trees, very specific.",121,,
572,0.97,3286.449,3300.764,"But in terms of removal of trees, they are required to have general liability insurance that they must prove to the state in order to get the state contractor licensed.",121,,
573,0.97,3300.764,3310.907,"That amount, I looked it up recently was $200,000 in public liability and $50,000 in property damage or $250,000 in combined single limits.",121,,
574,0.97,3310.907,3324.421,"So it's quite a bit lower than what you'll see for Sdot, but they also have different consideration around public right of way that is more in alignment with just a general Sdot permit.",121,,
575,0.97,3324.421,3328.391,So that may or may not be a barrier.,121,,
576,0.97,3328.391,3333.897,I suppose some have general liability insurance.,121,,
577,0.97,3333.897,3353.616,Accept the amount they think is appropriate and one would hope that would be through an outreach process right in something that's discussed in the memo in terms of connecting with businesses engaged in commercial tree work and understanding kind of where they are at.,121,,
578,0.97,3353.616,3372.235,"And I do think the certification for Arborist, there are those who say it is the minimum and it is not difficult to achieve that.",121,,
579,0.97,3372.235,3377.273,And I can talk more specifically about the exam.,121,,
580,0.97,3377.273,3377.807,Three years.,121,,
581,0.97,3377.807,3378.775,"Yolanda, just real quick.",122,,
582,0.97,3378.775,3386.082,I want to highlight you have now switched topics from talking about insurance to ISA certification.,122,,
583,0.97,3386.082,3396.126,"Yeah, council member Morales asked about both of those things.",123,,
584,0.97,3396.126,3397.694,"Yeah, sorry.",123,,
585,0.97,3397.694,3398.361,Don't change topics.,123,,
586,0.97,3398.361,3400.13,"Yolanda, take it away.",123,,
587,0.97,3400.13,3400.363,Yes.,124,,
588,0.97,3400.363,3413.443,"And I think, you know, in my engagement with Sdot on that topic, they did note that tree service providers have indicated that it's a challenge, right?",124,,
589,0.97,3413.443,3415.979,That's why they allowed for the retainer option.,124,,
590,0.97,3415.979,3421.618,"And to kind of give them a little bit, companies a little bit more flexibility to still register, right?",124,,
591,0.97,3421.618,3428.625,And NOTE who it is that they have on retainer who does have the ISA certification.,124,,
592,0.97,3428.758,3430.96,"That's helpful, thank you.",125,,
593,0.97,3431.094,3433.763,And I agree we need to be moving in this direction.,126,,
594,0.97,3433.763,3453.516,"I just want to make sure we're not having a desperate impact on some businesses rather than others as we're doing it particularly as we also have goals around, you know, providing, making sure we are supporting minority owned businesses, women in minority owned businesses in the city as well.",126,,
595,0.97,3453.65,3456.052,"Thank you, vice chair Morales.",127,,
596,0.97,3456.052,3458.188,I will come back to some of those comments.,127,,
597,0.97,3458.188,3463.96,"And it is so odd not to call you vice chair Mosqueda, former vice chair Mosqueda.",127,,
598,0.97,3463.96,3467.497,It is the first meeting of 2022.,127,,
599,0.97,3467.497,3467.964,Take it away.,127,,
600,0.97,3468.097,3469.866,"Thank you very much, Mr.",128,,
601,0.97,3469.866,3470.066,Chair.,128,,
602,0.97,3470.066,3476.272,And I'm glad to see you're in good hands with Council member Morales and the connections in the committee as well.,128,,
603,0.97,3476.272,3481.144,"Looking forward to working with all of you on the robust work plan in this Committee, Mr.",128,,
604,0.97,3481.144,3483.079,Chair.,128,,
605,0.97,3483.079,3486.115,"You know I actually just wanted to ask a question, Mr.",128,,
606,0.97,3486.115,3487.817,"Chair, and perhaps this is for you.",128,,
607,0.97,3487.817,3495.992,I know you have been steeped in this along with Council member Pedersen given the Co-Sponsorship on this issue or central staff just to step back a second.,128,,
608,0.97,3495.992,3502.632,"I thought there were some commitments made by previous Mayor, Mayor Durkan that appears to have not been followed through on.",128,,
609,0.97,3502.632,3510.54,"I just wanted to have a better sense of where we are at currently and just give me the context of, you know, what this bill is.",128,,
610,0.97,3510.54,3516.112,Are we trying to make up for items that the previous administration didn't follow through on?,128,,
611,0.97,3516.112,3525.722,"What is the sort of broader scope that we are entering this conversation because you have clearly been tracking this very closely, and I just want to make sure I understand that landscape as well.",128,,
612,0.97,3525.722,3530.293,And so it is a little bit of a Stepback if that is appropriate and Mr.,128,,
613,0.97,3530.293,3536.466,Chair just to understand a little bit more of what we're taking on verses where we thought we might be.,128,,
614,0.97,3536.599,3537.467,Thank you Council member Mosqueda.,129,,
615,0.97,3537.467,3541.871,Rightly so.,129,,
616,0.97,3541.871,3542.872,We had commitments.,129,,
617,0.97,3542.872,3552.115,And from my vantage point it seems like Sdci from what I can tell did their part in honoring that commitment.,129,,
618,0.97,3552.115,3561.925,"And the final decision was made, the former executive's level to not press, publish on publishing the decision.",129,,
619,0.97,3561.925,3579.842,It is a very problematic thing because it's an example of people in their departments doing their best and doing their work to move forward important policies only to be stopped at the last minute.,129,,
620,0.97,3579.842,3587.083,And so from what I can tell that the Sepa decision can be published and can be published in a short order.,129,,
621,0.97,3587.083,3594.424,And so Council member Pedersen and I are working with Mayor Harrell's administration to allow departments to do their work.,129,,
622,0.97,3594.424,3597.694,I don't have an update for you at this time.,129,,
623,0.97,3597.694,3611.441,I think it would be better to have as you noted this bill is one section of the presentation we received at the last land use committee meeting of many different sections in that comprehensive policy.,129,,
624,0.97,3611.441,3620.149,"And so if we are able to move that comprehensive policy forward together as a package, I think that's the ideal situation from a policy perspective.",129,,
625,0.97,3620.149,3626.289,And without that we don't have time to waste.,129,,
626,0.97,3626.289,3631.694,We don't have time to allow for illegal cuttings to continue.,129,,
627,0.97,3631.694,3635.264,Too much time has already elapsed.,129,,
628,0.97,3635.264,3639.402,"Council member Pedersen, do you want to share thoughts?",129,,
629,0.97,3639.402,3642.105,That's my take on this situation.,129,,
630,0.97,3642.105,3648.411,"Thank you, chair Strauss, and thank you for the question Council member Mosqueda.",130,,
631,0.97,3648.411,3651.381,The sooner we can get it all done the better.,130,,
632,0.97,3651.381,3654.017,I'm happy to do it in pieces.,130,,
633,0.97,3654.017,3656.953,I'm happy to do it all together.,130,,
634,0.97,3656.953,3668.231,You know what's nice about this particular bill is it is a discreet element that can be dealt with separately with other options too.,130,,
635,0.97,3668.231,3672.335,We don't know what the current administration is going to do or when.,130,,
636,0.97,3672.335,3678.408,So just happy to kind of work through this bill and see where we are at the end.,130,,
637,0.97,3678.541,3683.346,Great question.,131,,
638,0.97,3683.346,3687.05,"Colleagues, are there other questions and then I could run through my line of questioning.",131,,
639,0.97,3687.05,3691.32,Seeing no other questions.,131,,
640,0.97,3691.32,3694.59,I will come back to insurance.,131,,
641,0.97,3694.59,3700.263,I think it is important for us to not create insurance as a barrier to doing work.,131,,
642,0.97,3700.263,3708.438,I can tell you that with tree work especially on private property it is easy to get to a million dollars in damages.,131,,
643,0.97,3708.438,3725.988,"If you think of one branch falling out of a tree onto a home, I mean the damage to equipment, the damage to property that damaged the possible personnel can rack up quite quickly.",131,,
644,0.97,3725.988,3735.898,So I do think it's important to not allow insurance to be a barrier and we require insurance at a level that will meet the minimum standards.,131,,
645,0.97,3735.898,3752.381,"Anecdotally as well if somebody is working and they were to be injured on the job that put them permanently in an unable to do work in this nature in the future, then their life could be altered in a way that requires more than $1 million of support for the rest of their lives.",131,,
646,0.97,3752.381,3754.951,And just days where we are thinking about this.,131,,
647,0.97,3754.951,3758.02,"It's not just damage to property, people, and equipment.",131,,
648,0.97,3758.02,3764.327,It is also the longevity of these people and the people doing the work and their ability to continue living a good livelihood.,131,,
649,0.97,3764.327,3786.082,"On the ISA certification aspect, it does take three years for the course work to be completed and to be able to be eligible for that course work requires so many hours of working with I believe a certified ISA Arborist just to be able to be eligible to take that course work.",131,,
650,0.97,3786.082,3789.819,And that is about two years worth of work.,131,,
651,0.97,3789.819,3814.71,"And so for us to require an ISA certified Arborist on staff that could present a barrier, which is why I note that in this case it is again a good option for us to look at what is Sdot doing in making a uniform code because we heard public Commenters talk about it today and the desire to put all tree regulations into one Department.",131,,
652,0.97,3814.71,3817.513,I don't think we're quite there yet.,131,,
653,0.97,3817.513,3822.084,I do think we would need support throughout City hall to take down such a road.,131,,
654,0.97,3822.084,3832.662,"And for us to set us up best outcomes possible, we should be having uniform regulations between the public right of way and private property.",131,,
655,0.97,3832.662,3844.64,And so for that I know that I've spoken to Council member Pedersen and Yolanda regarding this.,131,,
656,0.97,3844.64,3851.047,I will likely want to bring an amendment about the ISA certified Arborists.,131,,
657,0.97,3851.047,3855.351,"The public notice, I think that we need to make it for longer period of time.",131,,
658,0.97,3855.351,3863.226,"If it is going to be only three days, then it needs to clarify they are three business days.",131,,
659,0.97,3863.226,3881.811,"I think the public notice also needs to include permit information or if there was no permit required, so we're not giving the public a false sense of is this or is this not allowed?",131,,
660,0.97,3881.811,3884.18,And other couple of notes here.,131,,
661,0.97,3884.18,3888.417,Let me just make sure that I got everything.,131,,
662,0.97,3888.417,3912.208,"And it is a Landowner that is publishing that notice because I do know from going out, giving bids to getting work lines up, I don't want to put another burden on the Arborist themselves for this notification to come around and set it up for whether it is three business days or 14 days.",131,,
663,0.97,3912.208,3924.12,And just reading over my notes here.,131,,
664,0.97,3924.12,3928.024,And then I think notice is important.,131,,
665,0.97,3928.024,3928.424,Is this intended?,131,,
666,0.97,3928.424,3930.593,"When I ask Council member Pedersen yesterday, he said both.",131,,
667,0.97,3930.593,3945.875,I said is this intended to just provide information to the public to know that a thing is occurring or is this an opportunity for the public to intervene in I think occurring.,131,,
668,0.97,3945.875,3947.743,And it is a little bit of both.,131,,
669,0.97,3947.743,3964.327,That's why it's important for us to have the permit information or there's no permit required and enough time for a city Department to be contacted to ensure everything is up to regulation.,131,,
670,0.97,3964.327,3967.73,Regarding the penalties.,131,,
671,0.97,3967.73,3980.409,I think it is a bit more cumbersome to stop an Arborist from being able to submit reports.,131,,
672,0.97,3980.409,3991.554,As compared to Sdot's removal from the Registry for one year following two notices of violation.,131,,
673,0.97,3991.554,4000.73,I do know under the proposed legislation it is per one violation of removing an illegal removal of an exceptional tree.,131,,
674,0.97,4000.73,4018.347,"That it is a little bit different of a threshold and Council member Pedersen, feel free to react on the record now or we can continue to workshop this my main goal here as collaboration.",131,,
675,0.97,4018.481,4019.648,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",132,,
676,0.97,4019.648,4031.894,"On the issue of the penalty, the concept here was to leave it up to Sdci.",132,,
677,0.97,4031.894,4039.402,It's likely they would choose to remove someone from the Registry if they violated.,132,,
678,0.97,4039.402,4048.11,They could also have them on the Registry and just NOTE we're not accepting reports from this particular tree service provider at this time.,132,,
679,0.97,4048.11,4050.88,So it gives them that flexibility.,132,,
680,0.97,4050.88,4067.396,It was written to just NOTE the hardline here is that they will not accept the ports from them on the public facing manner to let people know they're no longer on the Registry or they are not acceptable reports.,132,,
681,0.97,4067.396,4076.005,Just to put that on the Website for additional services and transparency.,132,,
682,0.97,4076.138,4077.506,Wonderful.,133,,
683,0.97,4077.506,4081.243,I will make sure we have amendments drafted up.,133,,
684,0.97,4081.243,4083.979,I see Council member Nelson has her hand raised.,133,,
685,0.97,4083.979,4085.681,Please take it away.,133,,
686,0.97,4085.681,4085.915,Yeah.,134,,
687,0.97,4085.915,4096.492,Well I have nothing to open up the whole bucket of works on this because I know you've been working on this for a long time and this is a small piece.,134,,
688,0.97,4096.492,4097.092,But let me see.,134,,
689,0.97,4097.092,4103.999,First of all I support the goals to preserve our tree canopy.,134,,
690,0.97,4103.999,4113.742,I staffed the very first urban forestry Commission when this was brought up way back when I worked for Council member Richard.,134,,
691,0.97,4113.742,4119.482,This is a small piece of many of the different proposals for protecting our canopy.,134,,
692,0.97,4119.482,4134.029,"And for when it comes to registration and I don't even know from this conversation, I may be getting there are questions that need to be answered, so I don't know if there is a vote today.",134,,
693,0.97,4134.029,4151.347,But my point is--is there any documentation or a report on the damage done in the course of trimming and cutting down trees by kind of shoddy Arborists?,134,,
694,0.97,4151.347,4165.861,"I mean is the problem we're getting at, do they have to represent a level of competency in their land, etc.",134,,
695,0.97,4165.861,4172.935,Is that the problem we're trying to solve R for here in this particular bill?,134,,
696,0.97,4172.935,4178.007,"I can take a crack at it, but I'll let the prime sponsor, do you want to go?",135,,
697,0.97,4178.007,4193.789,"Yeah, so I think a part of it is Sdot's tree, the Arborist registration provides the public a clear understanding of who to call for--for Arborist services.",135,,
698,0.97,4193.789,4203.198,It also provides the city and understanding of who our best businesses to work with.,135,,
699,0.97,4203.198,4220.616,There is as you eluded to a method that many landowners will engage in that says I'm going to hire somebody from out of town to come do work that is known to not be in line with the code.,135,,
700,0.97,4220.616,4231.927,And so part of this is Formalizing the process to make sure we know who is a registered Arborist for Seattle.,135,,
701,0.97,4231.927,4240.002,Also Arborists from other parts of the area can't be tricked into coming and doing work here in the city that does not meet our regulations.,135,,
702,0.97,4240.002,4252.114,I think one of the problems is folks will come in from other places and do work that meets the legal criteria of the areas they typically service.,135,,
703,0.97,4252.114,4259.521,And the Landowner or Homeowner is bringing them in to get around the code.,135,,
704,0.97,4259.521,4266.829,The rules and regulations that we have here in place in Seattle because we have stricter regulations in many ways.,135,,
705,0.97,4266.829,4272.167,"And so it is a way, so Arborists know am I registered in Seattle?",135,,
706,0.97,4272.167,4274.67,Can I work in Seattle or not?,135,,
707,0.97,4274.67,4278.274,Did I get at the intent there Council member Pedersen?,135,,
708,0.97,4278.274,4281.01,I'm seeing a head nod yes and a thumbs up.,135,,
709,0.97,4281.01,4284.38,"Yolanda, anything else you would like to share on that point?",135,,
710,0.97,4284.38,4288.15,I mean I think that's all accurate.,136,,
711,0.97,4288.15,4296.125,"Sdot, you know, they had, they did see people just kind of going out there chopping down trees.",136,,
712,0.97,4296.125,4300.829,Without any awareness of the city's regulations.,136,,
713,0.97,4300.829,4306.201,"So they are clear they are not recommending any of the folks who are listed on the Registry, right?",136,,
714,0.97,4306.201,4312.107,"They have applied, they meet the criteria for Registry, they are registered.",136,,
715,0.97,4312.107,4314.777,And they have indicated familiarity with the city's codes.,136,,
716,0.97,4314.777,4320.282,"Of course, there can be companies that are based well outside of Seattle who are registered, right?",136,,
717,0.97,4320.282,4325.888,"If they are doing work in Seattle, they will still need to meet the registration requirements.",136,,
718,0.97,4325.888,4344.34,"So I think they noted even if you are coming from another place, you will now, the Registry is a way to ensure that those folks who are doing work in Seattle really aware of Seattle's regulations so they are not doing other things that may be allowed in other jurisdictions.",136,,
719,0.97,4344.473,4346.341,Well that's helpful.,137,,
720,0.97,4346.341,4352.281,"I also should say I am also pro density, and I think we can have tree protection and density.",137,,
721,0.97,4352.281,4360.856,So I don't want to signal that any way.,137,,
722,0.97,4360.856,4369.198,My point is I think this seems to make sense as it is explained to me.,137,,
723,0.97,4369.198,4394.923,"And because there's no Department representative here, I'm wondering there's already a lot of backlog in permitting and so I just want to make sure that this doesn't add time, you know, in the amount of time to projects or to not projects that are being built where the tree is being modified.",137,,
724,0.97,4394.923,4406.835,I am talking about the whole backlog of permitting issues so that's just a comment for the record.,137,,
725,0.97,4406.835,4407.703,Amen Council member Nelson.,138,,
726,0.97,4407.703,4412.808,We can build the housing that we need in the density that we need to protect trees.,138,,
727,0.97,4412.808,4413.742,We can do both.,138,,
728,0.97,4413.742,4419.047,I think that is the importance of the comprehensive tree ordinance as a set of policies.,138,,
729,0.97,4419.047,4432.694,"And for Council member Nelson and Morales, our last committee meeting in December, we had a great presentation from Sdci about the different components of the overall tree ordinance.",138,,
730,0.97,4432.694,4440.135,And so you will see the registration is just about one bucket of that.,138,,
731,0.97,4440.135,4452.114,"Oh, would it be helpful if we invited somebody Toens a questions at our next meeting?",138,,
732,0.97,4452.114,4458.02,I'm seeing maybe.,138,,
733,0.97,4458.02,4466.962,"Yolanda, I don't have any further questions.",138,,
734,0.97,4466.962,4477.105,"Sorry, can you share why pruning is in the requirement for public notice and do you have a definition of major pruning?",138,,
735,0.97,4477.105,4478.006,Yes.,139,,
736,0.97,4478.006,4493.889,"So the legislation that defines major pruning defined in the ordinance, by Sdot, where major pruning means removal of branches two inches in diameter or greater, removal of roots two inches or greater in diameter.",139,,
737,0.97,4493.889,4500.496,Removal of branches Institute constituting more than 15% of the tree's foliage Baring area.,139,,
738,0.97,4500.496,4503.632,So it is fairly specific.,139,,
739,0.97,4503.632,4523.552,"I think it has been noted that sometimes major pruning, so that someone might be doing major pruning in the hopes of Maybe some intention of the tree not fairing well.",139,,
740,0.97,4523.552,4527.856,"And perhaps allowing for removal, which may not otherwise be allowed for removal rights.",139,,
741,0.97,4527.856,4537.132,Exceptional trees in particular are not allowed to be removed if very limited trees should be allowed to be removed.,139,,
742,0.97,4537.132,4545.641,But it should be pruned in such a way that will make it not viable or dangerous.,139,,
743,0.97,4545.641,4549.177,It could then be deemed hazardous and fully removed.,139,,
744,0.97,4549.177,4554.75,I think that is kind of capturing that potential.,139,,
745,0.97,4554.883,4556.118,Very helpful.,140,,
746,0.97,4556.118,4561.857,Understanding that it could be used as a mechanism to create a hazardous tree.,140,,
747,0.97,4561.857,4562.925,"Correct, correct.",141,,
748,0.97,4562.925,4563.225,Got it.,142,,
749,0.97,4563.225,4565.894,I don't have any further questions.,142,,
750,0.97,4565.894,4567.362,"Colleagues, one last check.",142,,
751,0.97,4567.362,4568.13,Seeing no further questions.,142,,
752,0.97,4568.13,4570.232,"Yolanda, would you like to continue?",142,,
753,0.97,4570.232,4574.97,"Yes, thank you.",143,,
754,0.97,4574.97,4576.772,"And so onto potential impacts, the frequent discussion.",143,,
755,0.97,4576.772,4591.72,And just noting this will expand the scope of the current registration requirement for tree service providers who are in the right of way to also include tree service providers who operate on private property.,143,,
756,0.97,4591.72,4607.736,"The city East most recent tree canopy assessment from 2016 found that over 70% of Seattle's total tree canopy is located to be covered and located on private property in the city's residential areas, which itself comprises 67% of land area.",143,,
757,0.97,4607.736,4618.981,"It's compared to the right of way, which contains for 20% of the city's total tree canopy cover whereas the land area of the right of way is 27%.",143,,
758,0.97,4618.981,4624.119,And just noting there are a lot of tree canopy covers in these residential areas.,143,,
759,0.97,4624.119,4636.698,They have observed since they established the registration management of Street trees have generally improved indicating the requirement could improve urban force management on private property.,143,,
760,0.97,4636.698,4657.653,"However, the Registry and associated requirements have not entirely eliminated issues with Street tree management, and Sdot continues to see tree service providers performing core tree work and unregistered tree service providers continuing to conduct tree work illegally in the right of way.",143,,
761,0.97,4657.653,4666.428,Another related issue is in regards to permitting tree work where Sdot requires a permit for any tree related work in the right of way.,143,,
762,0.97,4666.428,4671.066,Sdci provides limited oversight of trees outside of a development proposal.,143,,
763,0.97,4671.066,4680.208,"So on developed lots, Sdci requires a permit where more than three trees, six inches in diameter, the courier for the hazardous tree is proposed to be removed.",143,,
764,0.97,4680.208,4706.134,"If the property owner is removing fewer than three trees, or allowed per code per year, then they will not be able to confirm whether the tree service provider performing the work is registered, which could allow unregistered tree service providers to continue to operate in the city.",143,,
765,0.97,4706.134,4719.581,"Changing the activities requiring permits, so they do have greater oversight of tree management on private property would need to be taken up in separate legislation, which you all have.",143,,
766,0.97,4719.581,4728.523,"And so in terms of the tree service providers, there are over 900 businesses in the landscaping service industry with active city of Seattle business licenses.",143,,
767,0.97,4728.523,4736.865,Of these over 100 appear to specialize in tree and they would likely meet the definition of the tree service provider.,143,,
768,0.97,4736.865,4749.277,"But there are likely other companies providing landscaping services and considered commercial tree work, chose names do not work on trees.",143,,
769,0.97,4749.277,4756.318,National level data revealed workers in the landscaping industry are disproportionately Hispanic or Latino.,143,,
770,0.97,4756.318,4765.36,"The chart on the slide shows the workers, which are the three categories to the left.",143,,
771,0.97,4765.36,4767.829,And Ethnicity to the far right.,143,,
772,0.97,4767.829,4780.342,"So they do tend to be late at the national level, workers who identify as white, fewer people of color.",143,,
773,0.97,4780.342,4780.976,And they identify as Hispanic.,143,,
774,0.97,4780.976,4788.617,So continuing onto tree service providers.,143,,
775,0.97,4788.617,4799.728,"Based on the total number of landscaping businesses in Seattle, the proposal would likely impact a larger number of businesses than the 100 businesses that have applied for Sdot's Registry.",143,,
776,0.97,4799.728,4812.207,"And then as a result of the requirement, it could result in certain jobs if they cannot meet those Certifications.",143,,
777,0.97,4812.207,4822.384,"And since we have already kind of discussed those requirements, I will not go over them again unless anyone has any questions.",143,,
778,0.97,4822.384,4828.456,Participants in the city's outreach efforts last year were supportive of the certification requirements.,143,,
779,0.97,4828.456,4842.537,But some acknowledge that acquiring the credential could be a barrier in suggesting the city will offer an Arborist to be on retainer like what Sdot allows and for the city to also provide funding or other support to assist under representative workers with gaining and maintaining certification.,143,,
780,0.97,4842.537,4852.48,And so the community may want to consider amending the action of having a certified Arborist on retainer.,143,,
781,0.97,4852.48,4860.956,"In terms of costs, the cost of tree work could increase due to the requirement for a certified Arborist on staff.",143,,
782,0.97,4860.956,4872.1,"This may be mitigated by relying on the option of having an Arborist on retainer as we have discussed previously, so that companies do not have to pay the full cost of the certified Arborist on staff.",143,,
783,0.97,4872.1,4890.785,"In terms of implementation, they have indicated they have limited staff capacity currently to create a new Registry system within the time frame provided, requiring Sdci launch a new system in early July if the council passed the legislation on March 1.",143,,
784,0.97,4890.785,4896.424,And the tree service providers would then have to be registered with the city by early October.,143,,
785,0.97,4896.424,4905.133,They estimate that it will take six months to develop the new Registry system with potentially a launch in September.,143,,
786,0.97,4905.133,4920.649,"The system changes would be integrated with Sdci's permitting system to allow staff to confirm tree service providers are registered and they would also allow tree service providers to submit photos, public notice postings and other information as needed.",143,,
787,0.97,4920.649,4935.864,And in addition to more time Sdci indicated it will require more general fund resources for both implementing the technological changes as well as the culturally outreach to other Stakeholders.,143,,
788,0.97,4935.864,4944.172,We are still awaiting to hear from the Department on what the amount is and we will share that with you all as soon as we know.,143,,
789,0.97,4944.172,4951.546,The committee could consider amending the legislation to extend the time frame for implementation and outreach.,143,,
790,0.97,4951.546,4958.253,And also additional funding would need to be appropriated separately possibly as part of the mid year supplemental budget process.,143,,
791,0.97,4958.253,4968.196,We would NOTE here central staff is not currently aware of any readily available sources that could be used for this absent offsetting elsewhere.,143,,
792,0.97,4968.196,4971.733,"Onto enforcement, yes, sir.",143,,
793,0.97,4971.733,4976.738,"Quickly, Yolanda, I know in our Offline conversations I asked and I don't need the answer today.",144,,
794,0.97,4976.738,4985.647,I asked the question of can powers that are produced from enforcing illegal tree cutting be used to support this program?,144,,
795,0.97,4985.647,4990.652,Just flag it for the record and I know you were going to come back to me with that answer.,144,,
796,0.97,4990.652,4992.42,I'm just asking on the record.,144,,
797,0.97,4992.42,4996.257,"Yeah, penalties are a general fund resource.",145,,
798,0.97,4996.257,5003.365,"So the penalties from illegal, the fines that are paid for illegal tree cutting are considered the general fund resource.",145,,
799,0.97,5003.365,5003.698,I'm not sure.,145,,
800,0.97,5003.698,5018.813,"I would need to kind of better understand where those revenues flow to, but they would be, it seems given that they are general fund that they would be able to support this, but we would need a better understanding of Sdci's budget.",145,,
801,0.97,5018.813,5022.65,And to ensure that makes sense to them.,145,,
802,0.97,5022.65,5036.164,"On terms of enforcement, the new public service for major pruning or tree removal could result in increased calls to Sdci to increase their staff capacity to respond to complaints.",145,,
803,0.97,5036.164,5041.236,Indicating they may or may not need additional staff to meet the demand just depending on what happens.,145,,
804,0.97,5041.236,5052.347,"On the other hand I think the notice could help people better differentiate between permitted and Unpermitted tree work, so they may receive fewer calls for work that has been reviewed or permitted.",145,,
805,0.97,5052.347,5060.321,And can be more responsive to instances of Unpermitted tree work.,145,,
806,0.97,5060.321,5067.061,With that does anyone have any questions?,145,,
807,0.97,5067.061,5075.003,"I don't have any further questions, but that's because I have been overly engaged in the process.",146,,
808,0.97,5075.003,5076.704,"Council member Pedersen, any questions?",146,,
809,0.97,5076.704,5077.305,Thank you.,147,,
810,0.97,5077.305,5077.505,Same.,147,,
811,0.97,5077.505,5082.21,I don't have any further questions.,147,,
812,0.97,5082.21,5082.844,Very supportive of this bill.,147,,
813,0.97,5082.844,5087.048,"And so thank you, Yolanda for this briefing.",148,,
814,0.97,5087.048,5093.988,This legislation will be back before the land use Committee in the future.,148,,
815,0.97,5093.988,5096.691,First--more for further consideration than consideration of amendment.,148,,
816,0.97,5096.691,5112.807,My preference as I've stated a couple of times is this legislation would be taken up in a comprehensive tree ordinance because I think keeping this policy altogether will create a more uniform and better comprehensive tree ordinance.,148,,
817,0.97,5112.807,5120.148,"But if the decision remains unpublished, we must move forward because we have no more time to wait.",148,,
818,0.97,5120.148,5123.785,I would like to engage in this bill a little bit more.,148,,
819,0.97,5123.785,5128.223,"I've got--I want to ask some questions, some Stakeholders.",148,,
820,0.97,5128.223,5132.961,And I know I would like to do the stake holder outreach with Council member Pedersen.,148,,
821,0.97,5132.961,5146.674,And so this bill will either be back before us at the next committee if we are able to have those conversations between now and then and if not the committee following.,148,,
822,0.97,5146.674,5157.085,I have heard from Sdci that it will take a few months to get the systems up and running to administer this program.,148,,
823,0.97,5157.085,5164.659,And so allow this committee meeting and briefing to be the notice to begin that needed work to administer the back end to administer this work.,148,,
824,0.97,5164.659,5180.208,"And because it is clear that either through a comprehensive ordinance or through this ordinance we will have this, we would like to have this tree Arborist registration program up and running in the next six months.",148,,
825,0.97,5180.208,5184.145,And so just allowing this to be on the record.,148,,
826,0.97,5184.145,5189.551,Notice that there is work to be done internally.,148,,
827,0.97,5189.551,5194.255,"Please begin engaging since we don't have Sdci at the table, today there's no response.",148,,
828,0.97,5194.255,5196.357,We will continue working with you.,148,,
829,0.97,5196.357,5204.032,"And so again, if we are able to do that last bit of outreach between them and the next committee meeting, we will have this at the next committee.",148,,
830,0.97,5204.032,5211.239,"If not at the following committee and again it will be best to have the comprehensive tree ordinance before us, and to have it published.",148,,
831,0.97,5211.239,5214.275,And so those are my final comments.,148,,
832,0.97,5214.275,5215.076,Any other comments on this bill?,148,,
833,0.97,5215.076,5219.047,"Council member Pedersen, Prime sponsor, last word.",148,,
834,0.97,5219.18,5220.648,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",149,,
835,0.97,5220.648,5226.554,"I do want to thank Yolanda for her hard work on this with us, and also the city attorney's office.",149,,
836,0.97,5226.554,5228.556,They did a lot of work on this bill.,149,,
837,0.97,5228.556,5237.765,"And Yolanda for engaging, having some preliminary discussions with Sdci and Sdot.",149,,
838,0.97,5237.765,5240.201,I know there were some preliminary outreach done.,149,,
839,0.97,5240.201,5250.111,But I just want to thank our central staff for their hard work on this.,149,,
840,0.97,5250.111,5250.378,Thank you.,149,,
841,0.97,5250.511,5256.184,"Thank you, council member Pedersen, thank you Yolanda moving on to item 3.",150,,
842,0.97,5256.184,5264.192,"Final item is clerk file 314441, a contract Rezone in Northgate.",150,,
843,0.97,5264.192,5268.262,Please read the abbreviated title into the record.,150,,
844,0.97,5268.262,5287.949,"Clerk file 314441, application of Wallace properties, park at Northgate, LLC, for contract Rezone of a site located at 10735 Roosevelt way northeast from Lowrise 3 with an M mandatory housing Affordability suffix to mid rise with an M1 Mha suffix.",151,,
845,0.97,5287.949,5288.283,Thank you.,152,,
846,0.97,5288.283,5293.488,We are joined by Ketil Freeman of Council central staff.,152,,
847,0.97,5293.488,5304.599,"Ketil, can you remind us of the rules of quasi judicial matters and especially for the contract Rezones before we engage in this briefing?",152,,
848,0.97,5304.599,5304.832,Yes.,153,,
849,0.97,5304.832,5310.305,"I have a presentation, which touches on the type of action and the rules that applies.",153,,
850,0.97,5310.305,5311.339,Gives me the opportunity to extend the record.,153,,
851,0.97,5311.339,5318.78,I have a few things to say about the application just to kind of get your head in the space and thinking about the Rezone application.,153,,
852,0.97,5318.78,5322.717,I'll talk about the hearings and the recommendation and then some next steps.,153,,
853,0.97,5322.717,5332.193,So with that I will share my screen here.,153,,
854,0.97,5332.193,5358.052,"All right, so the type of action, as they mentioned is the quasi judicial system and the contract Rezone meaning the Council sits like a Bank of judges as opposed to legislators.",153,,
855,0.97,5358.052,5375.57,It's because the judicial decision making that Council is making a decision about one rights and land as opposed to balancing the benefits and burden associated with the action.,153,,
856,0.97,5375.57,5388.116,"Quasi judicial, now state law and just Anti-Lobbying that prohibits Council members from taking part in the communication and those are communications about the central proposal outside the process.",153,,
857,0.97,5388.116,5392.286,"So you can't hear, you can't be lobbied essentially by the proponents of the project.",153,,
858,0.97,5392.286,5399.961,And decisions have to be made on the record.,153,,
859,0.97,5399.961,5404.265,And the hearing Examiner establishes the record at a public hearing.,153,,
860,0.97,5404.265,5412.44,In this case the hearing was held back in October and we will talk a little bit about what is in that record.,153,,
861,0.97,5412.44,5418.312,"The portions of the record, some, but not all the record is in the file.",153,,
862,0.97,5418.312,5424.318,"You will find importantly an exhibit list, so you will see the exhibits that are on the record.",153,,
863,0.97,5424.318,5433.795,The memo associated also points you to the hearing that the hearing was never held.,153,,
864,0.97,5433.795,5460.688,"So the hearing and itself, the public hearing and summarized in the decision and Replicated in this power point presentation, where you will also find their recommendation, which was an affirmative recommendation as well as key exhibits on the Rezone application in analysis of how the application meets the Rezone criteria in the Seattle municipal code criteria.",153,,
865,0.97,5460.688,5468.663,And as well as you'll find more in terms of the written public comment that was submitted to Sdci.,153,,
866,0.97,5468.663,5481.042,A little bit about the application itself and the posture the committee is in and the proposed Rezone for them to walk through more information here in a minute.,153,,
867,0.97,5481.042,5487.114,But the proposed Rezone is of two sides in the Northgate urban center.,153,,
868,0.97,5487.114,5488.015,And the current zone Lir3.,153,,
869,0.97,5488.015,5492.186,They were up zoned through the housing Affordability city wide zones.,153,,
870,0.97,5492.186,5501.262,"The proposal is to those sides again and to one, and the mandatory housing Affordability of the suffix.",153,,
871,0.97,5501.262,5504.966,The combined site area is fairly large approximately five acres.,153,,
872,0.97,5504.966,5508.069,The application does not include a master use permit for development.,153,,
873,0.97,5508.069,5515.042,There is a description of the future development and what it might look like in the applicant's Rezone materials.,153,,
874,0.97,5515.042,5519.113,Just specifically in contemplating the development at the site in three phases.,153,,
875,0.97,5519.113,5526.153,They are currently between 150 and 200 units on the sites and older structures should be Redeveloped in about a thousand units.,153,,
876,0.97,5526.153,5532.76,The decision and the recommendation to approve was published back in September.,153,,
877,0.97,5532.76,5546.841,"And the appeal was filed and later dismissed for lack of understanding at the hearing Examiner held a public hearing on October 7, and December the hearing Examiner recommended additional approval to the Council.",153,,
878,0.97,5546.841,5548.809,We will talk about those conditions in a minute.,153,,
879,0.97,5548.809,5553.681,So a little bit about the sites.,153,,
880,0.97,5553.681,5560.855,So we will be seeing here on the left a map of the Northgate urban center.,153,,
881,0.97,5560.855,5565.96,You'll see the site on the Eastern edge of the Northgate urban center.,153,,
882,0.97,5565.96,5568.195,And these are maps from exhibit 10 on the record.,153,,
883,0.97,5568.195,5580.708,"They are kind of called out here the next one will give you a clearer view of how these sites will look to each other, also on the side of the driveway.",153,,
884,0.97,5580.708,5584.278,There is a North and top site.,153,,
885,0.97,5584.278,5591.886,What you see here are the environmental critical area.,153,,
886,0.97,5591.886,5598.492,An associated Wetland that the Department system and a couple of city owned that also will be applied to the natural area.,153,,
887,0.97,5598.492,5604.765,Here is a picture that they have on the aerial view and the section.,153,,
888,0.97,5604.765,5606.4,Looking West.,153,,
889,0.97,5606.4,5610.671,You can see the two sites there on the South site and the North site.,153,,
890,0.97,5610.671,5612.273,It's pretty large.,153,,
891,0.97,5612.273,5617.078,We'll come back to that in a minute and to discuss one of the recommendations and the conditions.,153,,
892,0.97,5617.078,5627.722,"And in this case you kind of review, it always helps me to show you the aerial view and the photograph of what's on the ground.",153,,
893,0.97,5627.722,5634.462,"Moving here to the hearing family and for a summary of the hearing on the testimony, our testimony was provided to the hearing Examiner.",153,,
894,0.97,5634.462,5637.098,And about six people testified.,153,,
895,0.97,5637.098,5644.472,"This is not the universe of public comment out there as I mentioned, about 20 individual common letters from both individuals and organizations.",153,,
896,0.97,5644.472,5647.708,And there was testimony from six folks.,153,,
897,0.97,5647.708,5654.982,They spoke about issues related to the proximity to the critical areas.,153,,
898,0.97,5654.982,5664.191,"And consistency with neighborhood plan, goals and policies and the comprehensive plans, concerns about Accumulative impacts and the infrastructure and neighborhood change.",153,,
899,0.97,5664.191,5671.365,One thing I recommend by the way of conditions.,153,,
900,0.97,5671.365,5684.178,"The Examiner recommended that the prior to Council action that the applicant submitted a signed and recorded Eca environmental area, restrict further development in the South side designated as an area.",153,,
901,0.97,5684.178,5690.518,And so it will be close to the water corks.,153,,
902,0.97,5690.518,5705.866,The applicant has transmitted to the Council an early version of what the critical area may look like by Seattle on the updated version over the next couple of weeks.,153,,
903,0.97,5705.866,5707.334,And recommending five additional conditions.,153,,
904,0.97,5707.334,5718.746,So with future development permit application for the South side of the applicant will be submitting a restoration plan for the portion of the South side adjacent to the North of the creek and the management area.,153,,
905,0.97,5718.746,5725.586,Both future development of the North and South sides would comply with the performance and not through payments.,153,,
906,0.97,5725.586,5728.189,The performance requirement under the and one scenario is 9%.,153,,
907,0.97,5728.189,5738.933,So assuming that a thousand units are developed here at some point in the future approximately 100 of them will be in the performance unit.,153,,
908,0.97,5738.933,5752.012,Future development of both sites would be the applicant intends to apply for the multi-family tax exemption program that will be a condition that would reside in the properties and the development agreement that Council could approve.,153,,
909,0.97,5752.012,5753.28,And maybe I'll just return here.,153,,
910,0.97,5753.28,5760.121,There is a condition related to an East-West pedestrian connection between Roosevelt and 8th Avenue.,153,,
911,0.97,5760.121,5776.203,"I'll return to this image because I think it kind of gives you a sense about the side of the North site, kind of a super block, so the condition would have an East-West pedestrian access to connect 8th Avenue.",153,,
912,0.97,5776.203,5789.917,The conditions that were added at the Examiner response to some of the testimony provided about potential parking impacts and impacts associated with vehicular access.,153,,
913,0.97,5789.917,5799.793,"Future development on the North side has to include a study of vehicular access with possible access, preferred access on Roosevelt way if that is something that will be allowed by the Lander's code.",153,,
914,0.97,5799.793,5802.93,So that's a summary of the proposal of the hearing Examiner's condition.,153,,
915,0.97,5802.93,5806.4,A few things about the next steps.,153,,
916,0.97,5806.4,5812.173,"On the 23rd the committee will have a briefing, continued discussion and possible vote.",153,,
917,0.97,5812.173,5816.41,Under recommendations of the full council.,153,,
918,0.97,5816.41,5828.622,The memo associated with this clerks file Vetoes the kind of how Council acts on Rezone applications there essentially two pieces of legislation that the Council acts on.,153,,
919,0.97,5828.622,5840.201,There is an inclusion and decision document in the clerks file and then that is implemented assuming it's a recommendation to approve through an ordinance that will amend the future land use map.,153,,
920,0.97,5840.201,5844.038,And amend the zoning map and also accept property use and development agreement.,153,,
921,0.97,5844.038,5854.014,"So between now and the 23rd, probably working to introduce legislation to provide the option for the Council to have the Rezone application.",153,,
922,0.97,5854.014,5856.183,There is a time limit for Council action.,153,,
923,0.97,5856.183,5868.195,The code requires that if there is not an appeal of hearings and the mission that they should turn around.,153,,
924,0.97,5868.195,5879.54,The Rezone application within 90 days will call the recommendation from the 90 days of the hearing Examer and get that in early December.,153,,
925,0.97,5879.54,5887.181,So Council should never act in early March.,153,,
926,0.97,5887.181,5887.748,That's a highlight overview.,153,,
927,0.97,5887.748,5896.223,I hope that will give you a sense of where to find things as I mentioned not all the record are Online.,153,,
928,0.97,5896.223,5902.062,When it is available on the second floor you can find it outside my office.,153,,
929,0.97,5902.062,5907.334,"If you want me to research particular aspects of the record, I'll pull the information for you.",153,,
930,0.97,5907.334,5908.669,If you have questions just let me know.,153,,
931,0.97,5908.802,5914.642,"Thank you, Ketil.",154,,
932,0.97,5914.642,5915.342,That was very helpful.,154,,
933,0.97,5915.342,5921.482,I'll NOTE it is somewhat unusual for a contract Rezone to not include a master use permit.,154,,
934,0.97,5921.482,5932.693,"Can you speak to why that occurs and why the development process--I guess what development process, what would it look like if this Rezone is approved?",154,,
935,0.97,5932.693,5932.926,Sure.,155,,
936,0.97,5932.926,5933.327,So you're correct.,155,,
937,0.97,5933.327,5939.066,It is most of the time a contract Rezone application is Companied by a development proposal.,155,,
938,0.97,5939.066,5949.41,And so there will be a permit application use that the Council will be considering will have pretty well developed design of a part of the Rezone application.,155,,
939,0.97,5949.41,5961.455,"It is not--so that is sort of more typical, but it's not unusual for the Council to get a Rezone application, called straight Rezones or there is not one associated with it.",155,,
940,0.97,5961.455,5976.603,If you sort of cast your mind back to about a year ago the Council was considering extending the Rezone that the Council added in Madrona and also did not have a permit associated with that.,155,,
941,0.97,5976.603,5988.182,"We do know a little bit about what may be proposed at some point in the future, that exhibit 10 I mentioned, which talks about how the proposal meets the Rezone criteria in the code.",155,,
942,0.97,5988.182,5993.187,It talks about future phases and it has some bulk in massing studies.,155,,
943,0.97,5993.187,6000.094,"So it is also not what the buildings look like, but just kind of what the box of the building might look like at some point in the future of the mid rise Rezoning.",155,,
944,0.97,6000.094,6006.867,And I don't know why the applicant didn't apply for a master's permit.,155,,
945,0.97,6006.867,6009.803,With the proposal.,155,,
946,0.97,6009.803,6016.176,But for a very large site like this it may very well have to do with phasing and refuse ability.,155,,
947,0.97,6016.176,6024.585,But future development would be governed by what is in the property use and development agreement.,155,,
948,0.97,6024.585,6030.991,So it's ultimately recorded assuming the Rezoning is approved and recorded against the property and the conditions that future development.,155,,
949,0.97,6030.991,6038.532,"And so there are some specific conditions for the South side, for example, having to do with proximity of the right corridor.",155,,
950,0.97,6038.532,6045.272,"The first mass use permit we see in the phasing plan, that's a part of the material and the record.",155,,
951,0.97,6045.272,6051.478,But the South side is likely to be the first site that's Redeveloped.,155,,
952,0.97,6051.478,6058.252,"When they are applied for redevelopment on that site, they will need to comply with the conditions associated with the South side.",155,,
953,0.97,6058.252,6060.487,And it is applied for the North site.,155,,
954,0.97,6060.487,6066.894,Those conditions such as the pedestrian use access after being incorporated into site design.,155,,
955,0.97,6066.894,6078.772,That's how the conditions would apply to future development and they might apply because of the permit use being recorded against the development.,155,,
956,0.97,6078.772,6081.542,"Thank you, that's very helpful.",156,,
957,0.97,6081.542,6086.046,Have the environmentally critical area and the unrelated documents been finalized at this time?,156,,
958,0.97,6086.046,6087.881,Will that happen before we vote on that?,156,,
959,0.97,6087.881,6090.184,Or is that a secondary process?,156,,
960,0.97,6090.184,6097.791,So both the recommendations from Sdci and the hearing Examiner was the South side to be recorded prior to Council action.,157,,
961,0.97,6097.791,6109.103,"So we have been in touch with the applicant about getting the Convenance finalized, so they don't have it recorded at this point.",157,,
962,0.97,6109.103,6114.174,But you can see the other integration with that and a little bit more in detail.,157,,
963,0.97,6114.174,6126.253,We would want Sdci to confirm it will comply with the criteria for the environment with the Convenance.,157,,
964,0.97,6126.253,6127.121,Thank you.,158,,
965,0.97,6127.121,6134.628,"So just to clarify if they do not certify that Covenant, we can't take this up, is that correct?",158,,
966,0.97,6134.628,6135.863,That's the recommendation.,159,,
967,0.97,6135.863,6156.083,"I mean the Council has some judgment here, but I think that we have time here that I think and the applicant is willing to provide the Convenance, so I think probably by the time full council acts we can have a Covenant that has been reviewed by Sdci.",159,,
