211,0.97,1313.679,1323.689,Here are things about barriers--all this other stuff.,45,,
212,0.97,1323.689,1327.225,Passing this--it is all just smoke and mirrors.,45,,
213,0.97,1327.225,1328.56,There is no barrier to delivery.,45,,
214,0.97,1328.56,1335.967,It is easier than other things.,45,,
215,0.97,1335.967,1344.543,"We need to focus on the point, which is there are people in this city living in poverty because they are not paid a fair compensation for the work they are doing.",45,,
216,0.97,1344.543,1364.963,I would like to say that I work with Shipt but I cannot because I have been deactivated for the second time in many months for dropping an order within an hour of the window when you have to go pick it up.,45,,
217,0.97,1364.963,1377.542,"This is because I had picked it and called immediately, less than a minute, and they took it off but yet they deactivated me.",45,,

234,0.97,1437.569,1447.679,Passing the PAYOUT campaign--it will allow me to earn a wage in which I could thrive and flourish in society.,49,,

247,0.97,1501.566,1503.301,There is no recourse for it.,53,,
248,0.97,1503.301,1514.346,I was recently deactivated from my account because I submitted my Seattle sick pay for two days and I told him the reason was because I had Covid.,53,,

250,0.97,1520.886,1532.764,I immediately got to them and it took them over two more additional weeks to get my account back and running after I submitted the paperwork.,53,,
251,0.97,1532.764,1547.379,"There was an additional week for me to even get the pay, which was --",53,,

258,0.97,1564.362,1568.6,Do we have our panel of Presenters present yet?,55,,
259,0.97,1568.6,1569.2,Yes.,56,,
260,0.97,1569.2,1570.035,There we go.,57,,
261,0.97,1570.035,1570.335,Excellent.,57,,
262,0.97,1570.335,1579.844,I know that we are being joined by interim chief Adrian Diaz and it looks like Brian is here as well.,57,,
263,0.97,1579.844,1593.558,"So, why don't we just jump into it, if our panel has a presentation.",57,,
264,0.97,1593.558,1597.562,"Interim chief Adrian Diaz, I will hand it to you for introductions and then we can proceed along accordingly.",57,,
265,0.97,1597.562,1598.83,"So, why don't you take it away?",57,,
266,0.97,1598.83,1599.431,Thank you.,58,,
267,0.97,1599.431,1601.533,I have our Coo on the line as well.,58,,
268,0.97,1601.533,1603.234,I will start us off with this presentation.,58,,
269,0.97,1603.234,1608.373,I want to think the chairs.,58,,
270,0.97,1608.373,1619.217,"I believe chairman Herbold cannot join us, but the rest of us are here . everything is about relationships.",58,,
271,0.97,1619.217,1630.729,"Over the course of my career, some of the success I have has been involved with--it could not have been accomplished without the wrestling shifts of partnerships I had developed.",58,,
272,0.97,1630.729,1632.364,It is because of these relationships we are stronger.,58,,
273,0.97,1632.364,1642.407,"When developing this initiative, we refer to--we are talking about the initiative.",58,,
274,0.97,1642.407,1643.174,It has four objectives.,58,,
275,0.97,1643.174,1668.933,"Developing relationships with the community we serve and compassion and Empathetic policing and everything that we do and how we serve, and then how to manage one's emotions and behaviors, and develop emotional responses and moderate trauma.",58,,
276,0.97,1668.933,1671.202,"In order to get there, it is based on three main components.",58,,
277,0.97,1671.202,1676.374,"A community center dialogue of learning and officer wellness and professional development, and a view of the criminal justice system that is 360 degrees.",58,,
278,0.97,1676.374,1676.908,What does that mean?,58,,
279,0.97,1676.908,1683.682,What we are focused on is really bringing a whole slew of training when it comes to social and emotional learning and bringing development to our officers.,58,,
280,0.97,1683.682,1687.552,We will do this prior to their time joining the Academy.,58,,
281,0.97,1687.552,1707.839,We will bring recruits in for 30 to 45 days prior to the economy and we will develop a level of training in Social/Emotional learning and to understand how these practices can better help facilitate De-Escalation.,58,,
282,0.97,1707.839,1728.46,"Also, to better understand how the community they will end up serving . through this dialogue, we will also provide them with listening sessions with community members, not only with police but police and race and also understanding the community and understanding the demographics of who we serve.",58,,
283,0.97,1728.46,1760.625,We have been doing some of the biggest dialogues in the central district to better understand the history of Seattle and for officers to be able to have discussions with community members that will really help understand the history of how policing came about and some of the tragic history of how we police in our communities as well.,58,,
284,0.97,1760.625,1767.198,"By bringing this to them, by bringing the recruits to this at the very beginning, this will give a more centered approach of how they can better work with our community.",58,,
285,0.97,1767.198,1769.134,The second component is officer wellness and professional development.,58,,
286,0.97,1769.134,1780.145,"We know if we are able to build resiliency early on, over the course of an officers career they will be exposed to a lot of trauma.",58,,
287,0.97,1780.145,1787.185,"They will see the shootings, the robberies, all the things that are traffic in our--we want to build that level of resiliency early on.",58,,
288,0.97,1787.185,1805.37,"We feel that the Social/Emotional learning from understanding when an officer comes to work, where they are at.",58,,
289,0.97,1812.21,1821.686,"If they come and they have had experiences at home and maybe they have had something that did not go right and they come to work and they are not in a good place, we know that might potentially carry out into how we serve the community.",58,,
290,0.97,1821.686,1824.789,We want to make sure that we are building that level of resilience early on.,58,,
291,0.97,1824.789,1827.225,"The second component is professional development, focused on--outward Mindsets.",58,,
292,0.97,1827.225,1834.833,"There is a whole level of development of training that we want, to make sure our personnel are equipped with, to really, really find themselves growing as a person on a daily basis.",58,,
293,0.97,1834.833,1842.173,The third thing is really to get a good overall view of the criminal justice system.,58,,
294,0.97,1842.173,1850.148,What we want to also bring into that is how diverse and can operate within our policing model.,58,,
295,0.97,1850.148,1871.903,"Typically, when I came onto the force, you know, we made an arrest and booked them into the county jail, and that was our level of work.",58,,
296,0.97,1871.903,1876.374,"We really have to understand how we can actually be part of a diversion, where we are starting the justice process.",58,,
297,0.97,1876.374,1884.949,We feel like understanding what the criminal justice system is all about and how we can make some changes culturally on the front and actually feel like we can accomplish something together as a community would be so important.,58,,
298,0.97,1884.949,1916.214,"As part of this training that we are looking at doing, they then go to the Academy and a focus on Guardianship versus warrior ship, and after the Academy, they come to what we refer to as--we would then reiterate the same values that we have.",58,,
299,0.97,1916.214,1920.118,We know that when we hire an officer that they will be with us for the next 30 years.,58,,
300,0.97,1920.118,1925.023,We have to provide that early on training prior to the Academy and prior to them going out and being deployed into the actual streets.,58,,
301,0.97,1925.023,1942.14,"If we are going to get our Department backup into staffing numbers, we will hire over 100 officers for the next several years.",58,,
302,0.97,1942.14,1949.247,"If we hire that money for the next five years, that will be over half the Department that will be infused with this level of culture change that we are really focused on.",58,,
303,0.97,1949.247,1959.19,"So, the reason why I took this course, we--they have started to do this with their teachers.",58,,
304,0.97,1959.19,1971.502,"They have really tried to understand when a student comes to school, we know that they have a whole level of trauma that has gone on in their life, from, you know, experiences of abuse at the home for drinking alcohol in the home.",58,,
305,0.97,1971.502,1983.348,"So, how do the teachers then be able to to be able to learn and develop, just like everybody else?",58,,
306,0.97,1983.348,1997.762,"We have different training for the teachers, to understand how they can help address those needs.",58,,
307,0.97,1997.762,2005.636,I feel there is a good place for police officers to also learn from the same practices because we are dealing with s people in trauma every single call.,58,,
308,0.97,2005.636,2026.457,"We know they are dealing with people in crisis and also know when people are victims of a crime, they are experiencing that level of trauma that we have to then understand how we can better serve them as Well., so this is going to be--this is one component on this whole policing initiative that we will be able to actually implement later this year.",58,,
309,0.97,2026.457,2039.003,"The Academy, I have already been in discussions with executive director from the criminal training Commission.",58,,
310,0.97,2039.003,2048.579,"We will be doing our own class, starting in June, and we will be launching a policing model in May, may 1ST.",58,,
311,0.97,2048.579,2052.884,"So, we have been in discussions with a variety of Nonprofits and other organizations to help lead the course curriculum work.",58,,
312,0.97,2052.884,2066.864,"We are also putting the schedule together, so we can actually be able to have a plan in place to know what they are going to be doing through that process.",58,,
313,0.97,2066.864,2070.101,The first class would be 30 days because it is something we have to do.,58,,
314,0.97,2070.101,2093.09,"We hope we will expand this out from what works and what did not work from the recruits, as well as learning from the community about how we can actually make this a stronger program.",58,,
315,0.97,2093.09,2097.361,"We hope to build this out to a full 45 days but, initially, we will start off with 30 days.",58,,
316,0.97,2097.361,2101.466,"This is an early run down of this program, and any questions I open up, for any might have.",58,,
317,0.97,2101.466,2114.345,"Thank you so much, chief Diaz, for that overview.",59,,
318,0.97,2114.345,2119.717,"I do not know if the Coo has anything that they want to share as well, or they are mostly here for potential questions.",59,,
319,0.97,2119.717,2122.987,I just want to give some space before we open it up to Council members.,59,,
320,0.97,2122.987,2127.325,I think I may here to respond to questions.,60,,
321,0.97,2127.325,2128.159,Let's get to those.,60,,
322,0.97,2128.159,2128.826,Thank you.,60,,
323,0.97,2128.826,2129.46,We can oblige.,61,,
324,0.97,2129.46,2131.295,I am sure there will be some questions.,61,,
325,0.97,2131.295,2154.886,"The first thing I want to throw out, chief, that I would like to ask you--I someone who represents downtown and has seen a lot of good collaboration between the West precinct and the Justin Kier program and a long-running relationship with the program, which is derivative of just care.",61,,
326,0.97,2154.886,2182.113,"How does that factor into this curriculum for the program, when you're looking at folks Pre-Academy come in terms of integrating them into that unique Seattle way of having that resource and how officers can learn about that resource and no how to utilize it in their work, to treat things that could be handled by another group of folks and allow them to move onto another priority?",61,,
327,0.97,2182.113,2189.12,"Is that what you envision later this year, of having a class in part of this curriculum?",61,,
328,0.97,2189.12,2189.42,Correct.,62,,
329,0.97,2189.42,2195.927,Thank you for that question.,62,,
330,0.97,2195.927,2215.079,"Really, what our focus will be is making sure that our officers have that exposure to programs that can help Diverge or be able to take some that load off the police officer X hands.",62,,
331,0.97,2215.079,2222.253,"We know sometimes that initial contact, we are dealing with unsheltered populations and they are not aware of what services were they have stolen something and the businesses are called.",62,,
332,0.97,2222.253,2225.523,We have to be able to figure out what services we can refer them to.,62,,
333,0.97,2225.523,2250.014,"Using just care or using it for long periods of time, but doing that prior to the actual time in the Academy, that sets the guidelines and expectations that this is something that is valued in our Department, and so--before, you would go for the Academy and go through your training and there would be something added on as part of your job.",62,,
334,0.97,2250.014,2276.34,"If this is what we are doing at the very front end of the work, we know that our officers will believe this is an expectation, that I am going to end up making sure our community is actually being served in the right manner.",62,,
335,0.97,2276.34,2276.774,Rate.,63,,
336,0.97,2276.774,2278.009,Could you speak a little more?,63,,
337,0.97,2278.009,2286.317,"Sort of in this recent answer, but a little bit more to that gap over all about this program and what it is feeling and the benefit this program is going to have to Seattle on an ongoing basis?",63,,
338,0.97,2286.317,2299.697,Given the sufficiency of the existing training prior to this program being conceived of?,63,,
339,0.97,2299.697,2300.097,Yeah.,64,,
340,0.97,2300.097,2306.17,"The state Academy provides, you know, five months of training but none of it is focused on building relationships and building connections and understanding where trauma might exist.",64,,
341,0.97,2306.17,2317.682,"We wanted to make sure that we are doing this on the front end, so that is one of the major components of it.",64,,
342,0.97,2317.682,2320.484,Help me out with the first part of the question that you had?,64,,
343,0.97,2320.484,2322.219,I apologize for starting with the second part.,64,,
344,0.97,2322.219,2322.887,Of course.,65,,
345,0.97,2322.887,2332.496,"What I'm getting at is we know the training from the state Academy, you know, it is necessary but not sufficient for everything we face in the city of Seattle, right?",65,,
346,0.97,2332.496,2360.424,"There are some gaps, and how is this program--with specific gaps to the program billing, and the potential for amending and changing the curriculum based on the feedback we received of how successfully it is achieving those goals?",65,,
347,0.97,2360.424,2361.058,Yeah.,66,,
348,0.97,2361.058,2365.096,"One of the biggest gaps is, I think, for the longest time, we became a very specialized police Department.",66,,
349,0.97,2365.096,2372.136,"So we had a unit for everything, for major crimes and for bikes and for community policing teams.",66,,
350,0.97,2372.136,2376.841,"What that did was it really pushed personnel to say, well, we will have that to the community outreach for them to handle.",66,,
351,0.97,2376.841,2383.347,What most officers do--it was not a bad model.,66,,
352,0.97,2383.347,2384.749,It made everybody very special.,66,,
353,0.97,2384.749,2415.913,"Over the course of the last two years, and losing the personnel I had, I have had to come in, shift people back and that is more for my focus--to try to make everyone--everybody has an opportunity to be a community outreach officer But everyone else has the opportunity to make sure they are well-trained and they can respond to an active shooter and have those same skill sets.",66,,
354,0.97,2415.913,2418.282,It is not just the community officer that handles the work.,66,,
355,0.97,2418.282,2423.921,It is every one of us.,66,,
356,0.97,2423.921,2427.158,That was a gap in our Department I want to to make sure I fixed.,66,,
357,0.97,2427.158,2443.774,"The second component to that is there was a gap in training because we have not really been able, Dude to the Academy, to provide that level of really developing, you know, interval relationships and understanding what that means.",66,,
358,0.97,2443.774,2446.777,I wanted to make sure we were going to address that issue as well.,66,,
359,0.97,2446.777,2451.749,"I know, you know, as we look at policing in general, we put a lot of the work on the officer's face hands.",66,,
360,0.97,2451.749,2459.69,We have crisis work and we make sure they were going to respond to anything.,66,,
361,0.97,2459.69,2471.235,We know they are not necessarily the model we want for future policing.,66,,
362,0.97,2471.235,2474.872,We want to make sure there are people that are mental health specialist to do that work.,66,,
363,0.97,2474.872,2484.849,"We want officers to kind of start to take some of that work off of we need to make sure there is an opportunity to train, that allows them to transition and understand what type of programs are out there, for them to transition work to.",66,,
364,0.97,2484.849,2494.758,"We also know because we are dealing with people that are in trauma all the time, we want to also make sure officers have the Social/Emotional skills to deal with this.",66,,
365,0.97,2494.758,2503.567,Not just one training class that is 24 hours and now they've gone through De- escalation and they will be able to solve every situation.,66,,
366,0.97,2503.567,2516.247,"No, we want to make sure it is a product of all levels of their Trainings to ensure they are just De-Escalating because they are dealing with people in trauma.",66,,
367,0.97,2516.247,2516.881,Thank you.,67,,
368,0.97,2516.881,2546.81,"So, my last question to that, I would ask about this program is they put forward to thousand dollars to get this off the ground and have a first class this year could you break down how that $200,000 is helping to facilitate this and what kind of programming needs to be paid for and what the expenses that this entails are?",67,,
369,0.97,2546.81,2550.214,I think that would be instructive as we look at how to continue supporting initiatives like this.,67,,
370,0.97,2550.214,2558.689,"Yes, we are for licensing--this is one expense we are dealing with, to coordinate all aspects of this.",68,,
371,0.97,2558.689,2578.776,"We have posted that position out, so if you--if anyone is listening to this, please, look at the job description and if you have those skill SETS we are looking for, please apply.",68,,
372,0.97,2578.776,2582.479,The second components we are contracting with Nonprofits in this area of brain development and Social/Emotional learning.,68,,
373,0.97,2582.479,2591.388,There are a lot of set of money that we are making sure that we are bringing some of the best practices in this area of training.,68,,
374,0.97,2591.388,2592.356,"So, that is another aspect.",68,,
375,0.97,2592.356,2603.033,"I'm actually talking with Federal partners, Federal Department of justice, the police call his office and the Nij on funding the research component.",68,,
376,0.97,2603.033,2620.884,"I want to make sure we are doing a process of valuation of how we build this program and what are the things we can work through, and then once the program is up and running, really doing a deep dive into is this the best practice for policing in general?",68,,
377,0.97,2620.884,2624.955,I do not know of another Department that is doing this type of thought process for this type of work.,68,,
378,0.97,2624.955,2630.628,"I feel like this is going to be cutting edge for not only our city, but for policing in general.",68,,
379,0.97,2630.628,2655.386,"That research work will have to be, you know, hopefully funded at the Federal level, but there is already a level of interest to find this program because they understand that this is how policing is evolving.",68,,
380,0.97,2659.356,2661.458,"Thank you so much, chief, for all the updates.",69,,
381,0.97,2661.458,2663.427,I will open it up now to committee members.,69,,
382,0.97,2663.427,2667.631,"Does anyone have any questions for the panel, regarding the status of the three basic law enforcement Academy program?",69,,
383,0.97,2667.631,2668.899,"Okay, seeing no questions from Council members.",69,,
384,0.97,2668.899,2674.538,"Keith, good to see you.",69,,
385,0.97,2674.538,2675.372,"Sorry, Councilmember Mosqueda?",69,,
386,0.97,2675.372,2679.743,That is a question.,69,,
387,0.97,2679.743,2692.056,You almost got to get out of here.,69,,
388,0.97,2692.056,2693.39,"Thank you very much, Mr.",70,,
389,0.97,2693.39,2696.026,"Chair and thank you, again, interim chief and team for being here.",70,,
390,0.97,2696.026,2699.53,I didn't have a question about that program.,70,,
391,0.97,2699.53,2719.416,"I do have questions, just generally come on the limitation on some of the aspects of the 2022 budget and I did not see you on the rest of the agenda.",70,,
392,0.97,2719.416,2723.754,"It looked like they're about to say goodbye, so I thought it would take a quick question to ask that.",70,,
393,0.97,2723.754,2737.067,"I think notably missing from the press conference last Friday was an indication of how much Council has put towards alternatives to public safety and an answer to the call to respond to the announcement of crime and violence we have seen, not just in Seattle but across the country.",70,,
394,0.97,2737.067,2745.242,We have this upstream of strategies that I think are building nicely with what you all have described on Friday.,70,,
395,0.97,2745.242,2752.85,I know that chair Herbold would be looking at these investments as well.,70,,
396,0.97,2752.85,2754.151,They relate to gun violence.,70,,
397,0.97,2754.151,2756.386,We have invested over $4 million into gun violence prevention strategies.,70,,
398,0.97,2756.386,2780.31,We are looking at reduction strategies and I have listened to one station and they asked what the city is going to do to address gun violence.,70,,
399,0.97,2780.31,2786.884,It is the question folks should be asking when they wanted it to be followed up with here are the dollars that have been allocated and how they are being implemented.,70,,
400,0.97,2786.884,2788.719,That was not part of the report I heard.,70,,
401,0.97,2788.719,2799.163,I thought it would give you a chance to see if you could fill in the blanks for the folks in the public about the dollars we have put towards gun violence prevention strategies and what they already are and how we had invested in gun violence reduction strategies.,70,,
402,0.97,2799.163,2799.93,That would be helpful.,70,,
403,0.97,2799.93,2829.126,We do updates on the American rescue plan Act and implementation efforts that predates that effort with the 2022 budget with the budget cycle which affect the 2021 year and then the 2022--we have had two consecutive years of investment in gun violence Reductio strategies.,70,,
404,0.97,2829.126,2847.01,Can I get a quick update on where we are at with those strategies and anything else you might want to highlight or if something is still waiting to be spent?,70,,
405,0.97,2847.01,2847.411,Thank you.,70,,
406,0.97,2847.411,2851.648,"I think when it comes to that, I think some of that is through the human services Department.",71,,
407,0.97,2851.648,2853.35,We also supported some of that extra funding.,71,,
408,0.97,2853.35,2859.489,"When it came two years ago, during the third shooting, after that, I really focused on a push to try to make sure we were finding critical responses.",71,,
409,0.97,2859.489,2872.536,That is the violence Interrupters and the Peacekeepers and the Passageways and other groups that are doing the work to try to stop retaliatory potentials and shootings.,71,,
410,0.97,2872.536,2881.945,I am really grateful for the funding of those programs because they do a whole lot of work on the backside to try to make sure those shootings are stopping.,71,,
411,0.97,2881.945,2894.725,"I cannot speak to the level of work of everything they have done but, you know, I know our city has already experienced a whole host of shootings.",71,,
412,0.97,2894.725,2897.427,"Last year, we finished with 612 shootings compared to 421 the year before.",71,,
413,0.97,2897.427,2910.407,"We have already started off not on the right foot, we have had had 79 Shootings/Shots fired compared to 42 last year.",71,,
414,0.97,2910.407,2916.58,Our city has experienced a whole host of increase of gun violence.,71,,
415,0.97,2916.58,2918.448,It is not necessarily related to youth or gang violence.,71,,
416,0.97,2918.448,2928.492,"We are seeing it in different areas and I think in those investments, we have actually seen it not rise to what other areas of shootings have occurred.",71,,
417,0.97,2928.492,2945.809,"We are seeing violence in random Drive-Bys, where Uber drivers are being shot at and domestic violence shootings.",71,,
418,0.97,2945.809,2950.314,There has been a whole host of different types of shootings but not necessarily in areas where Investmens have been done.,71,,
419,0.97,2950.314,2954.184,I think the city council--thank you for those investments.,71,,
420,0.97,2954.184,2967.698,I still have to also make sure that it is important for us to have enough officers to be able to respond to all the great levels of violence occurring as well.,71,,
421,0.97,2967.698,2968.799,"Thank you very much, chief.",72,,
422,0.97,2968.799,2976.373,"I appreciate that, and her press release noticed that for a second year in a row.",72,,
423,0.97,2976.373,2977.374,Thank you for the update.,72,,
424,0.97,2977.374,2981.411,"You're right, some of those investments are in SPD and Hst.",72,,
425,0.97,2981.411,2997.594,"We invested in it, and the central district.",72,,
426,0.97,2997.594,3022.285,"We want to make sure we are responding to it as a public health approach and I do appreciate you noted how, during this pandemic come we have seen all types of interpersonal violence escalates, as the Cochair would say, the shadow pandemic that has continued to plague our communities across this country during this very stressful time.",72,,
427,0.97,3022.285,3029.126,"Thank you for that update and we will follow up with Hsd on that, to make sure they are out the door.",72,,
428,0.97,3029.126,3032.829,"If there's anything else we can do to help streamline those dollars, I'm happy to do so.",72,,
429,0.97,3032.829,3033.897,Thank you very much.,72,,
430,0.97,3033.897,3045.342,"Chief, I actually have maybe a follow-up question and I think the door was open from Council member Mosqueda's line of questioning.",73,,
431,0.97,3045.342,3049.479,"It is not completely responsive to the agenda item but I am the chair, so I will allow it.",73,,
432,0.97,3049.479,3064.761,"I noticed at the press conference, a couple of days ago, you know, a statistic I requested from Coo Maxey and the police team was mentioned in that press conference.",73,,
433,0.97,3064.761,3078.041,I really appreciate the Department being responsive to my inquiries around this and that is the nexus of the alarming skyrocketing nexus of homelessness and shootings that we saw in 2021.,73,,
434,0.97,3078.041,3088.118,It is a very big driver of the increase in shootings.,73,,
435,0.97,3088.118,3117.447,"Just want to ask, based on your training experience, as a law enforcement official and what you have been doing over the course of last year, it has been my observation that when we have interventions like just care, where we can respond to an encampment and get everyone into some kind of shelter with background services and not have an encampment dominate a public space be at the--City Hall Park, that has a corresponding relationship, correlation to the decrease in violence and 911 calls.",73,,
436,0.97,3117.447,3140.403,"We are able to get people assistance and help they need, and not have a situation where we have a large and unwieldy encampment that is difficult to manage and much easier to manage, a sheltering situation.",73,,
437,0.97,3140.403,3142.739,We have not had a shooting and just care shelter.,73,,
438,0.97,3142.739,3144.474,I just want to hand it back over to.,73,,
439,0.97,3144.474,3147.911,I think that it is an important component of what the response has to be.,73,,
440,0.97,3147.911,3150.981,"Honestly, it is an important response to the public health crisis of the shootings.",73,,
441,0.97,3150.981,3163.693,We are moving some of the hazards that the shootings happen in in the first place.,73,,
442,0.97,3163.693,3165.495,I want to see your response to that.,73,,
443,0.97,3165.495,3169.499,We want to make sure that people are getting the services and the shelter opportunities that they need.,74,,
444,0.97,3169.499,3180.443,"We also know that those Encampments that grow and develop into some bigger Encampments, they have their own black markets or their own issues.",74,,
445,0.97,3180.443,3190.854,The things that we are investigating are anything from King to robberies to other shootings and other aggravated types of assaults.,74,,
446,0.97,3190.854,3226.99,"We need to make sure there is a process in place that people are getting services but also not allowing for the Encampments to be entrenched because that does generate a whole host of issues, and so these are things that, when I look at the shootings and shots fired, just this year alone, they have had a large share of these shootings and a part of that work is trying to address issues around Ethan King and in and around 12 and Jackson.",74,,
447,0.97,3226.99,3235.632,These are things that is making sure that people have access to services.,74,,
448,0.97,3235.632,3245.075,They are also addressing the criminal element that is also Victimizing those that are down on their luck as well.,74,,
449,0.97,3245.075,3262.859,I think we have to make sure that we take a comprehensive approach to addressing these needs and we do have to have a big component of enforcement and we need to make sure other Nonprofits are able to do their work as well.,74,,
450,0.97,3262.859,3264.628,Thank you so much for that answer.,75,,
451,0.97,3264.628,3266.596,I believe we had a question from Councilmember Nelson earlier.,75,,
452,0.97,3266.596,3267.631,Did I see that correctly?,75,,
453,0.97,3267.631,3273.169,"Oh, you were waving.",75,,
454,0.97,3273.169,3282.512,Okay.,76,,
455,0.97,3282.512,3282.946,"Okay, great.",76,,
456,0.97,3282.946,3285.048,"Chief, thank you for being generous with your time.",76,,
457,0.97,3285.048,3289.819,I know we went a little longer N this item than we anticipated and we appreciate that brief diversion into some other issues.,76,,
458,0.97,3289.819,3293.123,"I appreciate you coming by and thank you, for your service, Mr. Maxey.",76,,
459,0.97,3293.123,3295.659,"Mr. Clark, will you please read agenda item 2.",76,,
460,0.97,3295.659,3304.2,The OEM winter weather response draft after action report for briefing and discussion.,77,,
461,0.97,3304.2,3310.173,That panel just Miraculously appeared and they are ready to go.,78,,
462,0.97,3310.173,3311.408,"Thank you so much, Mr. clerk.",78,,
463,0.97,3311.408,3332.395,We are joined by director Terry Mayor and we will jump into the draft with the winter weather response report.,78,,
464,0.97,3332.395,3334.497,"I am happy to hand it over to you, curry Mayer.",78,,
465,0.97,3334.497,3341.671,"I do none of you have others joining us or not, but feel free to introduce yourself and then take it away on the presentation.",78,,
466,0.97,3341.671,3359.789,"Thank you, chair Lewis and committee members, for inviting me to talk about the winter weather response.",79,,
467,0.97,3359.789,3361.024,I very much appreciate it.,79,,
468,0.97,3361.024,3362.559,Good to be with all of you today.,79,,
469,0.97,3362.559,3363.426,I have one question.,79,,
470,0.97,3363.426,3364.461,Can I share my screen?,79,,
471,0.97,3364.461,3365.128,Will that work?,79,,
472,0.97,3365.128,3366.229,I have a short presentation.,79,,
473,0.97,3366.229,3367.03,"Yes, please do.",80,,
474,0.97,3367.03,3368.732,Give me just a second here.,81,,
475,0.97,3368.732,3369.632,I will bring that up.,81,,
476,0.97,3369.632,3376.873,I will share with you just some things I put together and then I am happy to answer questions after that.,81,,
477,0.97,3376.873,3377.173,All right.,81,,
478,0.97,3377.173,3377.974,We are almost there.,81,,
479,0.97,3377.974,3378.842,There we go.,81,,
480,0.97,3378.842,3386.316,Hopefully you can see the screen now.,81,,
481,0.97,3386.316,3387.15,It looks great.,82,,
482,0.97,3387.15,3387.817,Thank you.,82,,
483,0.97,3387.817,3388.418,"Okay, cool.",83,,
484,0.97,3388.418,3404.334,"First of all, I think it is important to share with you what an after action process and report is.",83,,
485,0.97,3404.334,3412.942,"So it is common practice in emergency management, following any kind of incident, that we respond to or a large exercise, that we do something called an action review and we put together a report.",83,,
486,0.97,3412.942,3415.311,What that does is it allows us to do several things.,83,,
487,0.97,3415.311,3431.227,We gather data from everyone involved in the response and ask a number of questions and what things did they think worked well and what maybe was missing and then recommendations for what we would do moving forward.,83,,
488,0.97,3431.227,3444.44,"We then share that information from that information gathering and we have, you know, clear categories of things we asked about, like response.",83,,
489,0.97,3444.44,3455.151,"Did you feel you have the equipment that you needed and were the proper partners there from outside agencies, things like that you might expect from response.",83,,
490,0.97,3455.151,3466.496,"Then that direct report goes through a number of these office of emergency management committees, and they are different groups of Stakeholders.",83,,
491,0.97,3466.496,3475.772,The strategic working group is actually the first group that gets in and they are a Subset of the disaster management committee.,83,,
492,0.97,3475.772,3479.409,The working group is all city's Department partners and the disaster management committee involves outside Stakeholders.,83,,
493,0.97,3479.409,3501.531,"That's a transit, Metro, utilities, all those outside agencies that would come in and help, depending on what the event in, that would have some involvement.",83,,
494,0.97,3501.531,3505.368,"That disaster management committee is looking at this report right now, which is why it is not finalized yet.",83,,
495,0.97,3505.368,3510.206,"Then it goes to the emergency executive board, which is this committee of the Department directors of the operational Department.",83,,
496,0.97,3510.206,3522.352,"They think of those departments that would have resources, either people with expertise or equipment that would be involved in the response in some way.",83,,
497,0.97,3522.352,3528.558,"Once they approve it, then it goes to the Mayor's office.",83,,
498,0.97,3528.558,3542.171,They then go to Council and we then are able to submit it for a publication.,83,,
499,0.97,3542.171,3545.975,"Then we put together something called an improvement plan of recommendations, following that final approval of the plan.",83,,
500,0.97,3545.975,3574.337,"That improvement plan is the piece that talks about--the plan, if you will, with Department needs for each of the recommendations that talk about what are those things we need to either do differently or we are missing or outside partners Maybe that were not involved from the last time, moving forward, then we know, you know, it is a constant continuous process of improvement.",83,,
501,0.97,3574.337,3583.947,"Also, the improvement plan is not meant to be a criticism.",83,,
502,0.97,3583.947,3588.451,It is just an opportunity for us to excel even more so the next time we have that type of event.,83,,
503,0.97,3588.451,3599.996,"Some people are a little sensitive when they hear ""improvement plan,"" but when they hear humans are involved, there is always room for improvement, right?",83,,
504,0.97,3599.996,3601.965,A little bit about--that is the process.,83,,
505,0.97,3601.965,3603.366,Little bit about the Pre-Event coordination.,83,,
506,0.97,3603.366,3609.205,The Office of emergency management get daily weather briefs from the National weather service.,83,,
507,0.97,3609.205,3617.981,"So we are always paying attention to how that might impact what we do, what we do for the city.",83,,
508,0.97,3617.981,3638.534,"Really, how her aim, all of the time, is to make sure there are not any events that will impact you for the Pavlenka was ability to get around the city or do their daily jobs for the city's ability to provide the services that we do all the time.",83,,
509,0.97,3638.534,3645.375,"The National weather service shows there was going to be this prolonged period of extreme cold and snow that would impact Seattle, December into January.",83,,
510,0.97,3645.375,3668.364,"So we began coordinating with city departments and that entails, what are you doing in your area of expertise, departments like transportation or citywide or public utilities or parks and Rec, what are you doing specific to your operations to get ready for this extreme cold event?",83,,
511,0.97,3668.364,3706.169,"Right at the beginning, Hsd identified two overnight shelter sites that they start with and then seeing how things work and if we needed additional sites, something called the joint information center, which has public information officers from all departments involved to get together and write emergency Messaging and talk about--having the media help us get the message out for folks, that the weather is going to be hazardous and what people can do.",83,,
512,0.97,3706.169,3707.904,You're probably familiar with this thing called Alertseattle.,83,,
513,0.97,3707.904,3718.047,"We sent messages to about 57,000 subscribers that weather was going to be hazardous and what they could do to prepare for that.",83,,
514,0.97,3718.047,3730.993,"Those were just some of the things but as I mentioned, we also talked with transportation because they would be involved in keeping Seattle mobile and looking at clearing streets and city light come in case there were power outages.",83,,
515,0.97,3730.993,3732.995,"All those departments, we started coordinating with immediately.",83,,
516,0.97,3732.995,3753.015,"So, then the forecast said, from December 25th, on Christmas, into the new year, that, in fact, it became a reality and we had a significant snow and they were forecasting 2 to 8 inches.",83,,
517,0.97,3753.015,3757.753,"Depending on where you were in Seattle, you got quite a bit of snow over the Christmas holiday.",83,,
518,0.97,3757.753,3777.44,We activated the--we would cut down on workers having to try to get around and we could do that coordination that we had a lot of practice with because of the pandemic.,83,,
519,0.97,3777.44,3780.243,We worked virtually and activated right after Christmas through the third of January.,83,,
520,0.97,3780.243,3795.358,"We had 25 agencies involved and city departments and outside partners and outside partners were Metro transit, Puget sound energy, folks like that that would need to be involved in this type of event.",83,,
521,0.97,3795.358,3804.8,"The major issues were snow management, of course, with transformation as the lead and also emergency sheltering.",83,,
522,0.97,3804.8,3823.085,This also landed on this transition of homeless and emergency sheltering for those experiencing homelessness.,83,,
523,0.97,3823.085,3825.488,It began with Hsd and Transitioned to the King County homelessness authority.,83,,
524,0.97,3825.488,3828.591,"That transition was going on while this was happening, that kind of Baton passing.",83,,
525,0.97,3828.591,3841.771,"It is important to note that my office and my team spent a lot of time, both with Hsd and the King County regional homelessness authority to make sure that transition worked well.",83,,
526,0.97,3841.771,3844.607,We wanted to be connected.,83,,
527,0.97,3844.607,3853.049,I am happy to report that baton tossing did go well.,83,,
528,0.97,3853.049,3853.883,There were some challenges.,83,,
529,0.97,3853.883,3885.248,"We had this perfect storm--the Covid Omicron variant was, you know, was spreading throughout . There were a lot of staffing challenges because of that and the holidays and then we have this huge need for drivers with commercial drivers licenses, not only for plowing, but for other equipment needs, so it was definitely an interesting challenge.",83,,
530,0.97,3885.248,3893.623,We were able to get what we needed but it was challenging for quite some time.,83,,
531,0.97,3893.623,3899.762,These are just a reminder of the overall objectives for this entire response.,83,,
532,0.97,3899.762,3942.238,"So, maintaining Situational awareness, so that departments could respond together, not being away from each other and also helping each other and also coordinating support for the community and for the severe weather shelters and if there should be a need for general population shelters and utilities, the health impacts, so if we did have Congregant shelter in, how are we making sure both those who were coming to the shelter and the workers were, in fact, protected?",83,,
533,0.97,3942.238,3964.96,"We also coordinated actions and resources to maintain city services, including public safety, and we also coordinated consistent Messaging with a community Stakeholder and employees, so that there were few avenues of messages going out, so you're not hearing things from different places and they could become confident that those messages were coordinated with the appropriate departments.",83,,
534,0.97,3964.96,3978.774,"So, just a couple of other things to highlight about the response.",83,,
535,0.97,3978.774,3982.445,Mayor Durkan signed an emergency order to provide monetary incentives for frontline workers and shelter service providers.,83,,
536,0.97,3982.445,3995.257,We had a number of employees who volunteered to go and help the shelter service providers.,83,,
537,0.97,3995.257,3999.128,There was such a big need because it was so cold and there was so much snow.,83,,
538,0.97,3999.128,4002.565,"We opened warming centers, which means they are open for just--they're not 24 our shelters.",83,,
539,0.97,4002.565,4007.269,"Those were at all the community, five community centers, city hall, and the armory, and some of the libraries were also open.",83,,
540,0.97,4007.269,4020.516,"Then we opened other shelters, a city center exhibition hall, housing alliance, and then it should say five additional locations.",83,,
541,0.97,4020.516,4021.317,Sorry about that.,83,,
542,0.97,4021.317,4021.584,Not six.,83,,
543,0.97,4021.584,4030.393,"Those were North Seattle, and then the was the American Legion post in West Seattle, and Seattle City hall, a church called ""God's little acre"" and the Seattle Mennonite church.",83,,
544,0.97,4030.393,4061.991,"They then took over the lead for sheltering from Hsd, and just a reminder, I know you heard from Sdot Separately, but they were in 24-hour separations and there was a number of drivers and equipment operators from other areas like parks and Rec and utilities who were able to assist Sdot because they were in 24 hour operations for a solid over two weeks.",83,,
545,0.97,4061.991,4075.137,Fas was also on a 24 hour schedule to support Sdot equipment needs.,83,,
546,0.97,4075.137,4098.994,"In spite of the fact we had unprecedented snowfall, we really, I think, we did a good job of coordinating resource support . Oh, and at the peak of the event, there were 379 beds available for people experiencing homelessness, and also that there were over 2000 overnight States provided through January.",83,,
547,0.97,4098.994,4102.898,Through January 3RD.,83,,
548,0.97,4102.898,4111.807,"So, that includes my overview of the After-Action report, and I am happy to take questions.",83,,
549,0.97,4111.807,4118.247,I will try to not--here we go.,83,,
550,0.97,4118.247,4123.319,All right.,83,,
551,0.97,4123.319,4131.193,Thank you.,83,,
552,0.97,4131.193,4133.229,Thank you so much for that presentation.,84,,
553,0.97,4133.229,4135.698,I have some questions but it Ooks like member Mosqueda raised her hand.,84,,
554,0.97,4135.698,4149.145,I am happy to see her first and I will go down my list.,84,,
555,0.97,4149.145,4150.312,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you are recognized.",84,,
556,0.97,4150.312,4151.48,I have two questions.,85,,
557,0.97,4151.48,4152.348,Perhaps you can address them.,85,,
558,0.97,4152.348,4175.738,"One is given how frequently we are anticipating these emergency weather situations to come with climate change, how are you working to start operational responses like the ones we have had last year and the year before, both to extreme cold and extreme heat and smoke, et cetera?",85,,
559,0.97,4175.738,4182.177,"Is there a way for us to not see it as a surprise emergency, you know what I mean?",85,,
560,0.97,4182.177,4184.146,How do we Bake it in?,85,,
561,0.97,4184.146,4197.86,"And then--one of the shelters was the Salvation Army, I believe, just up the hill, from Dell ridge.",85,,
562,0.97,4197.86,4203.899,They were surprised that they were on the list of emergency shelters.,85,,
563,0.97,4203.899,4236.365,"One individual is a volunteer and he was not given a heads up about their location being on the list, and I understand he was spending the night there because of the staffing needs and not having enough volunteers to make the call for volunteers to come in.",85,,
564,0.97,4236.365,4238.634,Do you know if that is just an Outlier?,85,,
565,0.97,4238.634,4242.838,How do we do a better job of notifying organizations who have a need for additional staff when that comes?,85,,
566,0.97,4242.838,4243.305,Yeah.,86,,
567,0.97,4243.305,4244.573,"Yeah, thank you for those questions.",86,,
568,0.97,4244.573,4266.629,"So, first, we always come with weather, have a little bit of time because we get the briefings from the National weather service, however, they have a number of plans at the office of emergency management that we Operationalize and practice with other city departments, so that we are practicing how we would respond to different events all the time.",86,,
569,0.97,4266.629,4268.797,So there is a time where we are caught off guard.,86,,
570,0.97,4268.797,4276.672,That does not mean there could not be some freak weather events that catches us Offguard.,86,,
571,0.97,4276.672,4277.306,That could definitely happen.,86,,
572,0.97,4277.306,4289.952,But we have a number of plans and the training and practice time to Operationalize those and we do that on a regular basis.,86,,
573,0.97,4289.952,4301.23,"In fact, there is something happening now in emergency operations center with our city Department representatives, to walk through in person training, which we have not done in quite some time because of the pandemic.",86,,
574,0.97,4301.23,4317.98,"That way, everybody stays up to speed on those skills and coordination techniques that they might not use all the time.",86,,
575,0.97,4317.98,4318.847,"So, we do that.",86,,
576,0.97,4318.847,4328.624,"The other thing that we have been doing, starting this last year is looking at what are some mitigation things we can do for extreme weather events?",86,,
577,0.97,4328.624,4334.396,"Where there are other city facilities and partnered locations, where can we use them for both heat and cold?",86,,
578,0.97,4334.396,4335.23,We are doing that.,86,,
579,0.97,4335.23,4345.774,We are starting that right now.,86,,
580,0.97,4353.649,4354.616,There are two efforts.,86,,
581,0.97,4354.616,4362.791,"One is looking at what are all departments doing that could be considered mitigation efforts for extreme weather events and what are the things that are missing, doing that assessment, what are people doing now and what is missing?",86,,
582,0.97,4362.791,4366.628,"Also, looking at, we have a better comprehensive view or what they need that we can use.",86,,
583,0.97,4366.628,4376.138,"How are--can people get to them quickly, you know, by bus or walking or something else?",86,,
584,0.97,4376.138,4376.805,That is something.,86,,
585,0.97,4376.805,4377.873,Transportation is always an issue.,86,,
586,0.97,4377.873,4381.009,"As you might imagine, in a snow event, it is hard to move people.",86,,
587,0.97,4381.009,4381.744,We did do that.,86,,
588,0.97,4381.744,4388.05,"We did move people, you know, to shelter sides, but it can be an issue.",86,,
589,0.97,4388.05,4398.394,We are trying to make that--look at all those places where we might have access to a facility that could be used to house people.,86,,
590,0.97,4398.394,4419.248,"So, then the Misidentification of the Salvation Army facility, we still do not know exactly how that happened, why that was on the list.",86,,
591,0.97,4419.248,4423.085,So we are still investigating that as part of the work we are doing with this after action.,86,,
592,0.97,4423.085,4428.223,"Also, you know, what we do moving forward for people experiencing homelessness is going to be supporting the King County regional homeless authority.",86,,
593,0.97,4428.223,4430.592,"As you know, they are the lead for all of King County.",86,,
594,0.97,4430.592,4432.728,We are happy to support them.,86,,
595,0.97,4432.728,4448.911,"I spent some time with them, talking about how emergency management works and how access to city facilities and resources occur, so they are really plugged into us and they understand the process.",86,,
596,0.97,4448.911,4456.752,"So, we will continue to support that, but it is them as the lead and us in more of a support role.",86,,
597,0.97,4456.752,4460.622,"But once I find out about the Salvation Army, I'm happy to circle back and find out.",86,,
598,0.97,4460.622,4461.957,"That was not a good thing, sorry.",86,,
599,0.97,4461.957,4465.761,Thank you for the questions.,87,,
600,0.97,4465.761,4466.228,Thank you.,88,,
601,0.97,4466.228,4478.941,I have a related but slightly different question . This is about looking forward to extreme weather events.,88,,
602,0.97,4478.941,4481.743,"Hopefully, we will not have another extreme snow weather event this year.",88,,
603,0.97,4481.743,4482.177,You never know.,88,,
604,0.97,4482.177,4507.202,"But in terms of looking forward to the summer and the possibility of having another extreme heat weather event, how applicable are some of these lessons learned to mitigating extreme weather events in general and how could they be Tweaked to be instructive with preparation for June and July?",88,,
605,0.97,4507.202,4539.301,"I only mentioned that because, you know, I think over the last two years, I have been on the Council now through at least three pretty severe weather events that had massive consequences and, Similarly, seem to have produced similar lessons.",88,,
606,0.97,4539.301,4541.803,I'm glad we are developing this after action report and adapting recommendations.,88,,
607,0.97,4541.803,4544.907,"This is very welcome, a welcome change from how we responded the previous couple years.",88,,
608,0.97,4544.907,4559.288,"I want to make sure we're not in a position where if there is another heat of and or heat wave, that we are similarly in a position where we look back on, you know, an inadequate response and think, Oh, boy, wish we would have known to do something different.",88,,
609,0.97,4559.288,4570.599,I want to make sure you take advantage of this moment to--we want to know that is likely the next one we will face.,88,,
610,0.97,4570.599,4571.266,"Right, right.",89,,
611,0.97,4571.266,4572.568,I do not know.,90,,
612,0.97,4572.568,4573.201,I appreciate that.,91,,
613,0.97,4573.201,4582.945,"Having come from California, I was really shocked when I first came here not everyone had air conditioning.",91,,
614,0.97,4582.945,4596.358,"I think that is, you know, one of the challenges here, that so many places where people live do not have air conditioning and even some of our city facilities do not.",91,,
615,0.97,4596.358,4597.459,A couple of things.,91,,
616,0.97,4597.459,4610.806,"I will go back to what you asked first, Councilmember Lewis, about are we prepared for the next--if we should move from now to a heat event.",91,,
617,0.97,4610.806,4628.09,"The response piece is going to be relatively the same in terms--who do not want to clear snow, right?",91,,
618,0.97,4628.09,4630.058,We do not want to have to clear streets.,91,,
619,0.97,4630.058,4637.032,We will not so much focus on our people able to get around the city and focus more on what do people need to stay cool and get out of the hot weather?,91,,
620,0.97,4637.032,4639.067,So a couple of things that we are working on.,91,,
621,0.97,4639.067,4640.836,One is shorter-term and one is more long-term.,91,,
622,0.97,4640.836,4642.404,The long-term has a couple components to it.,91,,
623,0.97,4642.404,4668.93,"The short term like last year is going to be, one, how do we help people ahead of time, ahead of the extreme events, and understand that, one, the event is coming, and where can they go to cool off if they live in a place that does not have air conditioning?",91,,
624,0.97,4668.93,4670.032,So that is the first thing.,91,,
625,0.97,4670.032,4688.45,"We are constantly looking for places and I mentioned a while ago that assessment that we can use in a snow event, the other piece of that is what are the city facilities we can use that have air conditioning, to keep people cool.",91,,
626,0.97,4688.45,4689.718,"So, that is an ongoing piece.",91,,
627,0.97,4689.718,4691.453,The other longer-term for heat events is this.,91,,
628,0.97,4691.453,4700.896,When we have applied for some money come from the Federal Government and there is one for libraries to install air conditioning.,91,,
629,0.97,4700.896,4702.13,They can serve as cooling centers.,91,,
630,0.97,4702.13,4734.93,"We are also looking at applying for grant money, for other housing that does not have air conditioning and looking at some other ways we can help people get cool and if it is not conditioning, are there other methods of cooling that can be used, installed, or used, that are not as expensive, so we can help those apartments or other kinds of housing that does not have cooling capabilities?",91,,
631,0.97,4734.93,4764.292,"The longer term, of course, applying for the grant money and doing those improvements to the buildings will take some time, and in the meantime, we are looking at other places that we can go and how can we partner with our neighbors, to look at where places we can take people, either transport them or help them get to a place where they can stay cool.",91,,
632,0.97,4764.292,4772.234,It is something that will not be totally fixed until we are able to do some of those improvements on buildings that are older and do not have cooling capabilities.,91,,
633,0.97,4772.234,4778.774,I think that his work we are look forward to over the next couple of months.,92,,
634,0.97,4778.774,4786.114,"We have--we have time on our hands to prepare and plan, given that it is still chilly outside.",92,,
635,0.97,4786.114,4799.094,But I can see that--thank you so much for that answer.,92,,
636,0.97,4799.094,4802.631,Do we have any other questions from the committee members?,92,,
637,0.97,4802.631,4810.071,"Okay, seeing none.",92,,
638,0.97,4810.071,4812.34,"Director, thank you so much for joining us this morning.",92,,
639,0.97,4812.34,4831.059,I appreciate the update and I look forward to continuing to work on these critical issues.,92,,
640,0.97,4831.059,4831.693,Akamai appreciated.,93,,
641,0.97,4831.693,4833.261,Thank you so much for having me.,93,,
642,0.97,4833.261,4833.762,Thank you.,94,,
643,0.97,4833.762,4834.362,Take care.,95,,
644,0.97,4834.362,4837.766,"Okay, Mr. clerk, Willie Reed our third and final agenda item into the record?",96,,
645,0.97,4837.766,4849.01,"Number three, the Pay-Up policy proposal update /Draft legislation.",97,,
646,0.97,4849.01,4849.845,Thank you so much.,98,,
647,0.97,4849.845,4851.613,So this will be a briefing and discussion.,98,,
648,0.97,4851.613,4856.251,We are not intending to vote on anything but definitely looking to solicit feedback from committee members for the central staff presentation.,98,,
649,0.97,4856.251,4864.392,"We want to provide an update on some work that chair Herbold and myself, actually, have been doing on minimum compensation legislation for gig economy workers.",98,,
650,0.97,4864.392,4872.3,"So, I will go ahead and handed over to our panel, which consists of Amy Gore and Karina Bull.",98,,
651,0.97,4872.3,4881.142,"Karina bull, do you want to introduce yourself and then handed off to any?",98,,
652,0.97,4881.142,4881.576,Absolutely.,99,,
653,0.97,4881.576,4882.444,"Good morning, Council members.",99,,
654,0.97,4882.444,4892.988,I am with Council central staff.,99,,
655,0.97,4893.255,4896.424,"I am Amy Gore and I am with Council central staff, thank you.",100,,
656,0.97,4896.424,4908.169,"This morning, there is an informational briefing on the minimum payment ordinance and I am pulling up a presentation.",101,,
657,0.97,4908.169,4909.437,It should be before you now.,101,,
658,0.97,4909.437,4934.296,"This presentation is several parts to it and to keep everyone engaged, and to make sure I answer all of your questions, I will take about four brakes to see if there are any inquiries, and Amy is also here to answer questions as well.",101,,
659,0.97,4934.296,4962.49,"To begin, this pay up proposal is addressing a suite of labor standards for workers who are treated as independent contractors by network companies and these proposals will be grouped into a number of bills and cover a range of topics, ranging from minimum payment to rights against unwarranted Deactivation and protections against discrimination and other items.",101,,
660,0.97,4962.49,4982.544,"Some of these issues are so interconnected that they are grouped together in ordinances, such as what we are going to discuss this morning.",101,,
661,0.97,4982.544,4983.912,This is the minimum payment ordinance.,101,,
662,0.97,4983.912,4994.055,"So, the main issues that are addressed in this draft legislation that I will present today include minimum payment, transparency, and flexibility.",101,,
663,0.97,4994.055,5033.695,"Just as background, the reason for these ordinances, as a reference, is workers that are working for these network companies, whether they are delivering food or groceries or going to someone's home to put together furniture or take items to be thrown away at the dump, they are hired as independent contractors and they do not have the rights of employees, which range from minimum wage standards to protect it leads to a whole host of other issues.",101,,
664,0.97,5033.695,5038.666,"This proposal is seeking to remedy some of those absences of protections and this legislation is focusing specifically on payment, transparency, and flexibility.",101,,
665,0.97,5038.666,5046.174,"Consistent with other labor standards, there is a notice of rights that company's duty to Rovide for workers and Recordkeeping requirements and printed retaliation and it would be implemented by the office of labor standards.",101,,
666,0.97,5046.174,5057.285,"Right now, I think it is enforcing and implementing about 18 different labor standards for Seattle's workers.",101,,
667,0.97,5057.285,5059.654,"Up until this point, there has been extensive community engagement.",101,,
668,0.97,5059.654,5077.806,"Council members will remember that last spring, when the council passed an independent ordinance, there was a commitment by Council to consider this proposal for workers, including minimum payment and the other protections as well.",101,,
669,0.97,5077.806,5084.379,"Since last summer, there have been over 10 Stakeholder meetings that Council members have led with workers, worker advocates, companies, and also labor standards and civil rights.",101,,
670,0.97,5084.379,5089.884,They have coordinated with Council offices in the background.,101,,
671,0.97,5089.884,5093.721,"For Council committees, this is the third committee.",101,,
672,0.97,5093.721,5109.27,"This is--for some Council members, this Slideshow will be familiar, although it has been updated since the previous two presentations.",101,,
673,0.97,5109.27,5121.382,"So, at its heart, this ordinance is seeking to provide or ensure payment of minimum wage, plus payment for expenses, with a permanent--engaged time to perform each offer.",101,,
674,0.97,5121.382,5145.74,The legislated would cover at based workers who are accepting offers to perform physical services for pay and that would be facilitated or presented by a network of companies and worker platforms.,101,,
675,0.97,5145.74,5153.414,"As I mentioned before, these are the workers who are delivering the groceries and they are delivering the food and they are delivering from any retail store that is offered by the network company.",101,,
676,0.97,5153.414,5168.096,They could come to someone's home to take care of pets and to clean the house and to put together a class it or Whatnot.,101,,
677,0.97,5170.632,5173.801,"There is a wide range of services like staffing, doing laundry, many, many different services.",101,,
678,0.97,5173.801,5181.342,It is quite broad but there are a number of Online orders and workers that are working with the attic that are not covered would not be covered by this legislative.,101,,
679,0.97,5181.342,5197.258,"That includes those accepting offers for goods and real estate and licensed professional services and office of labor standards, identifying those professional services by rules.",101,,
680,0.97,5197.258,5200.461,"It might be architecture or it might be a number of different things, creative works.",101,,
681,0.97,5200.461,5222.483,"So, if a person is connecting with an at based workers to develop a plan for a business or a financial plan for a personal finance thing, those would be wholly Digital surfaces that would not be covered by this legislation.",101,,
682,0.97,5222.483,5232.627,"Similarly, if a consumer is connecting with a App-Based worker to make a Quilt or to make a T-shirt or something about that, that would be considered a sale of goods that would not be covered by this legislation.",101,,
683,0.97,5232.627,5240.602,"Notably, the legislation would not cover workers that are providing for higher vehicle services.",101,,
684,0.97,5240.602,5248.042,The Tmc drivers are covered by another legislation that requires a minimum compensation for those workers.,101,,
685,0.97,5248.042,5256.384,"Network companies would be those that are providing these opportunities for work, to workers that are larger.",101,,
686,0.97,5256.384,5261.456,They would have 250 or more App- based workers.,101,,
687,0.97,5261.456,5281.576,"Some are excluded, including those where it is purely a Facilitation between the worker and the company--not the worker, the contractor and the company, transmitting payment and advertising boards, they hesitate to identify services.",101,,
688,0.97,5281.576,5302.797,"I think there is an example like Craigslist, where it is purely an Intermediately relationship between the App and those with the services.",101,,
689,0.97,5307.101,5308.67,"So, that is an overview of coverage.",101,,
690,0.97,5308.67,5310.505,Are there any questions about that part of the legislation?,101,,
691,0.97,5310.505,5319.681,To any committee members have questions for this first segment of the presentation?,102,,
692,0.97,5319.681,5320.381,I am seeing none.,102,,
693,0.97,5320.381,5321.215,You may continue.,102,,
694,0.97,5321.215,5321.649,Thank you.,103,,
695,0.97,5321.649,5330.058,"So, the minimum payment structure, as I mentioned to--go ahead, Councilmember Mosqueda.",103,,
696,0.97,5330.058,5332.026,I just have questions about five and six.,104,,
697,0.97,5332.026,5348.643,I think--central staff has structured it in such a way where they would like to take care of some of the questions at the appropriate place.,105,,
698,0.97,5348.643,5349.977,I think that works fine.,105,,
699,0.97,5349.977,5350.411,Thank you.,106,,
700,0.97,5350.411,5351.679,"Thank you, great to see you.",106,,
701,0.97,5351.679,5355.383,Thank you for all the work you have done on this for a long time now.,106,,
702,0.97,5355.383,5356.25,"So, two questions for you.",106,,
703,0.97,5356.25,5358.353,Does this legislation cover App- based domestic workers like Babysitters?,106,,
704,0.97,5358.353,5362.123,"We know there are Apps that people can sign up for and sign workers, via those Apps.",106,,
705,0.97,5362.123,5370.798,"If the answer is yes, how does this legislation interact, if at all come with power domestic workers bill of rights?",106,,
706,0.97,5370.798,5382.076,The second question is it seems like this could cover a whole host of workers.,106,,
707,0.97,5382.076,5394.389,Having trouble imagining all the different types of workers who offer services via an App.,106,,
708,0.97,5400.161,5410.505,"I really do appreciate this definition is broad and Forward- looking because of the changing nature of work, generally but do we have an idea of how this applies to the current universe and the breadth of the type of workers given the various Apps that are out there?",106,,
709,0.97,5410.505,5413.274,Thank you for those questions.,107,,
710,0.97,5413.274,5418.212,"The first one is about domestic workers and, yes, this legislation could cover domestic workers who are obtaining work through a network company platform.",107,,
711,0.97,5418.212,5430.958,It will depend on what the relationship is between data network company and the domestic workers.,107,,
712,0.97,5430.958,5469.797,"If it is purely an intermediary relationship, where the company is not accepting payment and it is not in any way monitoring or controlling the person's work and their ability to appear on the platform, that would not be covered, however, when the company is taking a role with active engagement with the worker, accepting payment, performing background checks, these are just examples, controlling payment, controlling where the worker can and cannot be, based on performance or feedback on the App, those types of situations would warrant coverage by this legislation.",107,,
713,0.97,5469.797,5475.069,"If so, those workers would be covered both by the bill of rights ordinance, as well as this.",107,,
714,0.97,5475.069,5496.123,This ordinance sets a floor for payment of minimum wage for those workers and it States that such workers have to be paid at least the minimum wage by small employers.,107,,
715,0.97,5496.123,5504.699,"This ordinance provides more protections, so this is the one that would control the minimum wage that would apply to those workers because companies under this ordinance are considered a large employer and must pay the large employer minimum wage.",107,,
716,0.97,5504.699,5508.836,It is higher for a couple more years and then all employers will pay the same minimum wage.,107,,
717,0.97,5508.836,5509.67,That is across Seattle.,107,,
718,0.97,5509.67,5511.405,"In this legislation, they also pay for reasonable expenses.",107,,
719,0.97,5511.405,5526.454,"Domestic workers covered by this legislation will end up earning more than what they would be owed under the domestic worker bill of rights, which is just a flat minimum wage and does not include payment for reasonable expenses and miles.",107,,
720,0.97,5526.454,5527.455,A quick follow-up questions.,108,,
721,0.97,5527.455,5533.261,That is a yes.,108,,
722,0.97,5533.261,5534.362,Thank you very much.,109,,
723,0.97,5534.362,5536.197,"So, Okay, I think I understand the difference.",109,,
724,0.97,5536.197,5558.152,"If there is a transaction where the App is responsible for it, that they are managing payments and providing payment to the worker, even if they are considered communal, and it infinite contractor, if they have that kind of Transactional role, then the ordinance would apply?",109,,
725,0.97,5558.152,5558.552,Correct.,110,,
726,0.97,5558.552,5569.897,It is an App that provides services.,110,,
727,0.97,5569.897,5573.134,They send the workers and they pay the workers they would be covered by this legislation.,110,,
728,0.97,5573.134,5575.503,"If there is an App, it is making connections, I guess.",110,,
729,0.97,5575.503,5582.41,I was looking for child care and I wish there was one App that showed me all of the Dividers and who is accepting Kiddos and at what age they are at.,110,,
730,0.97,5582.41,5631.926,"I know that they are trying to have something like that in the works, but let's--it was--I would assume a worker or a user might actually pay a fee for that convenience . If there is any transaction to be on a platform or to use a platform, that still does not apply to those workers because it is not a fat how much they are getting paid and the receipts they have from the transaction, from the recipient of the service.",110,,
731,0.97,5631.926,5632.226,Correct.,111,,
732,0.97,5632.226,5655.883,"Might sense from the type of relationship or situation you are describing is those that were companies and workers would not be covered by this legislation, so you are talking about purely a posting of who is available.",111,,
733,0.97,5655.883,5660.254,Perhaps the workers paid to be there and sometimes they paid to be hired as an at based worker.,111,,
734,0.97,5660.254,5664.725,What you--what you are describing sounds like the company does not have control over the worker and just referral.,111,,
735,0.97,5664.725,5669.964,I imagine the office of labor standards will help companies and workers and the public to understand who is covered and not covered by this.,111,,
736,0.97,5669.964,5671.899,I imagine that would be in their outreach materials?,111,,
737,0.97,5671.899,5682.443,Your next question is addressing the full breadth of network companies and App- based.,112,,
738,0.97,5682.443,5686.981,There are many working in the city and it seems like there is going to be more and more in the future.,112,,
739,0.97,5686.981,5690.017,"So, earlier, I described the type of workers that are covered and not covered.",112,,
740,0.97,5690.017,5721.615,"The legislation does have a fair amount of description of the types of Online orders that would not be covered and the type of network companies that would not be covered and, again, I think the office of labor standards would come in and help to make clear whether--through outreach materials and questions and answer documents, to help the public understand what types of companies and workers are and are not covered.",112,,
741,0.97,5728.222,5730.057,"Does that answer all your questions, Councilmember?",113,,
742,0.97,5730.057,5731.192,Or do you have a follow-up?,113,,
743,0.97,5731.192,5732.593,That answered my questions for now.,114,,
744,0.97,5732.593,5734.929,"I have a question in a few minutes, I am sure.",114,,
745,0.97,5734.929,5735.362,Thank you.,114,,
746,0.97,5735.362,5741.001,Are there any other questions before we proceed with the central staff presentation?,115,,
747,0.97,5741.001,5741.469,"Okay, seeing none.",115,,
748,0.97,5741.469,5742.837,We can continue with the presentation.,115,,
749,0.97,5742.837,5743.337,Thank you.,116,,
750,0.97,5743.337,5753.681,"Moving forward to minimum payment, at its core, this legislation would require they receive a minimum payment for their engaged time and the engaged miles.",116,,
751,0.97,5753.681,5764.058,"Those two conceptual terms, engaged time and engaged miles are at the core of this legislation.",116,,
752,0.97,5764.058,5767.294,The engaged time is the time that a worker spends performing the services for the offer.,116,,
753,0.97,5767.294,5772.466,The engaged miles are the miles traveled by a worker during that engaged time.,116,,
754,0.97,5772.466,5786.68,"They are part of this concept and they are interconnected, depending on the type of work that the App-Based worker is doing.",116,,
755,0.97,5786.68,5791.018,When the engaged time starts and ends is going to depend on the type of offer that the worker is performing.,116,,
756,0.97,5791.018,5823.851,"So if the offer is from what is termed ""an On-Demand network company"" or where it is expected to happen within two hours, that engaged time is going to begin upon acceptance of offer and it is going to end upon completion of the offer, or cancellation, whatever happens in that unique situation.",116,,
757,0.97,5823.851,5831.625,"So, for example, if a worker ACCEPTS an offer to deliver food from a grocery store, that engaged time is going to begin as soon as that worker says, yes, I want to take this offer.",116,,
758,0.97,5831.625,5841.302,"That time is going to include the time it takes to drive from wherever they are, when they say, yes, to the grocery store, buying the groceries, delivering the groceries to the customer it was home, that would stop as soon as they are delivered.",116,,
759,0.97,5841.302,5843.47,Mileage will also count that entire time.,116,,
760,0.97,5843.47,5852.546,The mileage clock would begin taking when the worker ACCEPTS the offer and all the way through the store and to the customer's home.,116,,
761,0.97,5852.546,5904.298,"In all other situations, aside from what I just described, the engaged time would begin upon the offer, reporting to the assigned location and end of--for example, if a consumer, through a network company, has someone come to their home to put together shelves in the closet or Hangings on the wall or to take something to the dump, the engaged time would begin when that worker reports to the consumer's home or when they begin the performance of the offer, say there is a timing component.",116,,
762,0.97,5904.298,5905.332,Come to the home at 2:00.,116,,
763,0.97,5905.332,5906.8,The performance would begin at 2:00.,116,,
764,0.97,5906.8,5908.702,It would end when that specific service was over.,116,,
765,0.97,5908.702,5915.442,"In that particular situation, there is no mileage because the company would not be expected to cover the mileage from wherever the worker was, their home, or a previous area to their destination.",116,,
766,0.97,5915.442,5927.421,"However, if, during the course of that--the worker does driving connected to the service, that would be covered.",116,,
767,0.97,5927.421,5941.502,"For example, if the worker is going to someone's home and they pick up the dog and they go to the dog park and they are driving their car to get to the dog Park, that mileage to and from the dog park would count for purposes of engaged mileage and also for engaged time.",116,,
768,0.97,5941.502,5949.81,"If the worker is going to multiple homes to pick up four dogs, then all that mileage would be covered from home to home to home and back again from the park.",116,,
769,0.97,5949.81,5951.912,Here is a definition of the On- demand network company.,116,,
770,0.97,5951.912,5979.206,"It is quite broad and it has some examples but the particular attention to what it would include but not be limited to companies primarily engaged in facilitating or presenting On-Demand offers from eating or drinking establishments, food processing, grocery stores, or any facilities supplying groceries.",116,,
771,0.97,5979.206,5990.784,"These would include the mere situations of delivering restaurant food, groceries, from a warehouse--ghost kitchens, et cetera.",116,,
772,0.97,5990.784,5995.889,"Because it is so broad, it could also include delivering from a retail store or a Pharmacy or other kinds of stores as well.",116,,
773,0.97,5995.889,6013.874,"As far as the math of the minimum payment calculation, it is simply, at its heart, a permanent amount of times the number of minutes per mile, times the number of engaged miles and you add those two together and you get a minimum payment amount.",116,,
774,0.97,6013.874,6025.953,"So, I will work everyone through what that permanent amount is and what that Mile-An- hour is and how they got there.",116,,
775,0.97,6025.953,6031.525,So the permanent amount for 2022 is nine cents a minute.,116,,
776,0.97,6031.525,6038.032,The per mile is $.73 a minute.,116,,
777,0.97,6038.032,6042.436,It is comprised of a number of different factors.,116,,
778,0.97,6042.436,6043.537,I will go through each one.,116,,
779,0.97,6043.537,6049.109,"At a summary level, it is the minimum wage equivalent and associated cost factor and associated time factor.",116,,
780,0.97,6049.109,6058.152,The cost factor and the time factor are Multipliers of the minimum wage equivalent.,116,,
781,0.97,6058.152,6076.737,Those are multiplied or compounded on the minimum wage equivalent to account for the expenses that an and the contractor has to bear to do the work in all the time that is necessary to complete the work.,116,,
782,0.97,6076.737,6093.654,"The per mile and out is comprised of the IRS standard mileage amount, which is what employees are owed when they are doing work for their employer, and if they have to drive to the store or they work in a restaurant and drive to th store to get the eggs or whatever materials or to drive to the home care.",116,,
783,0.97,6093.654,6096.59,They expect to reimburse the employee for that expense because it benefits the employer.,116,,
784,0.97,6096.59,6099.226,Similar kinds of tear for the ad based worker.,116,,
785,0.97,6099.226,6127.221,"There also is an associated factor for mileage, which is the Multiplier that recognizes workers need to drive more than others that are just connected to performing the offer.",116,,
786,0.97,6127.221,6132.459,"So, I will go back to this main calculation, just to give a quick example before going to the breakdown of those various components.",116,,
787,0.97,6132.459,6149.676,"Say, if a worker ACCEPTS an offer, to deliver food from a restaurant, the entirety of the offer takes 20 minutes to perform and the worker drives five miles, the permanent amount with engaged minutes would be $.39 times 20 minutes, which is $7.80.",116,,
788,0.97,6149.676,6153.514,That would be added to the upper mile amount and it is five miles times $.73.,116,,
789,0.97,6153.514,6171.331,"That is $3.65--in total, that offer to deliver food from the restaurant took 20 minutes and five miles and that payment will be $11.45.",116,,
790,0.97,6171.331,6182.342,"The minimum wage equivalent, just to break these numbers down, will not go too deep into this because I know I presented it to Council members in the past.",116,,
791,0.97,6182.342,6185.679,It is the permanent amount for whatever the minimum wage is.,116,,
792,0.97,6185.679,6187.347,"This year, it is $17.27 an our.",116,,
793,0.97,6187.347,6190.517,You divide that by 16 and you get a permanent amount which is 28.8 cents.,116,,
794,0.97,6190.517,6196.757,The cost factor is compensating workers for expenses that they need to pay to do their work.,116,,
795,0.97,6196.757,6221.248,"A typical employee would have their employer pay for these expenses and in this situation, the contractors, they are the expense but it is benefiting the network company, so they are compensated for those costs under this legislation.",116,,
796,0.97,6221.248,6228.622,"Same thing for the associated time factor, recognizing the amount of time a worker expense for an offer is not limited to the amount of time it takes to drive to the store and back.",116,,
797,0.97,6228.622,6233.427,It includes a time for rest breaks and to review offers and time in between each offer and time to perform administrative tasks.,116,,
798,0.97,6233.427,6248.642,"The mileage factor is compensating workers for the miles that they need to drive, that are above and beyond what is required to perform the offer.",116,,
799,0.97,6248.642,6252.346,"Traveling between offers, traveling to locations per rest breaks, et cetera.",116,,
800,0.97,6252.346,6264.925,"Now, some offers might not rise--actually, what--companies are required to pay at least five dollars for every offer.",116,,
801,0.97,6264.925,6275.936,"Even if combining the minutes and the miles they did not get to five dollars, workers will still need to be compensated for that amount.",116,,
802,0.97,6275.936,6293.253,"They recognize situations where a worker maybe starts work on an offer and the offer is canceled by the customer or by the network company, then the worker would still receive payment of five dollars.",116,,
803,0.97,6293.253,6308.835,This amount would be annually adjusted every year to reflect inflation and they could issue rules to establish a grace period between acceptance and cancellation of the offer that would serve as an exemption to this minimum per offer amount.,116,,
804,0.97,6308.835,6322.349,That could cover situations or maybe customers ordered something that was purely a mistake and was canceled very quickly after the worker accepted the offer.,116,,
805,0.97,6322.349,6324.284,That is a review of the payment calculation.,116,,
806,0.97,6324.284,6326.42,Are there any questions about that component of this proposal?,116,,
807,0.97,6326.42,6328.388,Any questions on the section from committee members?,117,,
808,0.97,6328.388,6336.363,Councilmember Mosqueda?,117,,
809,0.97,6336.363,6337.497,Thank you very much.,118,,
810,0.97,6337.497,6339.066,Can we go back to slide eight?,118,,
811,0.97,6339.066,6339.366,Yes.,119,,
812,0.97,6339.366,6340.233,I do not mind.,119,,
813,0.97,6340.233,6340.867,Here we are.,119,,
814,0.97,6340.867,6350.577,I appreciate that--thank you for your work on this.,120,,
815,0.97,6350.577,6353.08,This question is more appropriate for Cheryl Lewis or Sher Herbold.,120,,
816,0.97,6353.08,6362.055,That is great but this would be helpful.,120,,
817,0.97,6362.055,6367.327,I am wondering about the mechanics of this and how it would work for the breath of the workers that we just talked about.,120,,
818,0.97,6367.327,6397.224,"Are there instances in which someone ACCEPTS an offer and does not begin work on it, like, Prescheduled delivery, for example, for two hours but the clock starts under example one?",120,,
819,0.97,6397.224,6398.825,I assume that happens on the back end?,120,,
820,0.97,6398.825,6407.167,"Right, in situations where it is Prescheduled, but performance is expected within that two our window, that the company would need to know, Okay, this is actually the kind of offer where engaged time begins upon acceptance.",121,,
821,0.97,6407.167,6421.014,"If a worker ACCEPTS an offer within one our, they need to go to someone's home to take care of a pad or to do something else, to do something, that will take care--the company is responsible for identifying those situations.",121,,
822,0.97,6421.014,6448.008,"If it is something where the worker is agreeing in three days to go to someone's home, to take care of the pets, then they are responsible for identifying that, where engaged time begins when the worker reports to the home or whatever time that offer is scheduled to begin.",121,,
823,0.97,6448.008,6448.875,"Okay, that is helpful.",122,,
824,0.97,6448.875,6452.145,"I think my last question, I see some other ends, so I will be brief.",122,,
825,0.97,6452.145,6459.019,You have considered stacking or the instances where there are multiple Pickups and drop offs at the same time.,122,,
826,0.97,6459.019,6462.689,Has that been considered and can you walk us through how that might work under this scenario?,122,,
827,0.97,6462.689,6465.258,"For situations with stacking, that would be considered a single offer.",123,,
828,0.97,6465.258,6465.926,Under this legislation.,123,,
829,0.97,6465.926,6482.943,"It would be up to the company to combine all of the offers, such that it would be considered a single offer and then all of the engaged time and the mileage would all be consolidated for the worker.",123,,
830,0.97,6482.943,6504.064,"So, I think that probably would work best with something that is Prescheduled, although it might fit into the On-Demand situation if it is within two hours.",123,,
831,0.97,6504.064,6506.399,It will be up to the company to bundle those together.,123,,
832,0.97,6506.399,6513.306,"There could be situations where, as the worker is performing an offer, they get noticed, while you're at the store, pick up eggs and milk for another customer that lives nearby.",123,,
833,0.97,6513.306,6520.68,That can still be considered for a single offer but there are some limitations or parameters on data that are listed in the legislation.,123,,
834,0.97,6520.68,6521.848,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",124,,
835,0.97,6521.848,6522.649,Any more follow-up questions?,124,,
836,0.97,6522.649,6524.15,"Okay, Councilmember Pedersen?",124,,
837,0.97,6524.15,6534.094,"Thank you very much, chair Lewis.",125,,
838,0.97,6534.094,6535.161,Thank you for the presentation.,125,,
839,0.97,6535.161,6547.841,"Just taking a step back, are there any other cities that have implemented this type of program?",125,,
840,0.97,6547.841,6550.644,"So, for Rideshare drivers, Seattle has minimum compensation for Rideshare drivers.",126,,
841,0.97,6550.644,6552.178,New York City has a minimum compensation.,126,,
842,0.97,6552.178,6565.792,New York City also has just passed legislation requiring their equivalent of the office of labor standards to develop a minimum payment standard for food delivery drivers.,126,,
843,0.97,6565.792,6583.31,"So, those are examples of local jurisdictions that either have it regulated or in the process of regulating these types of workers.",126,,
844,0.97,6583.31,6588.281,My understanding is that this would be the most to--this would be the widest breath of workers covered by local legislation.,126,,
845,0.97,6588.281,6619.679,"In Massachusetts, these types of workers are considered employees and in California, there is the proposition 22, the voter approved ballot initiative where companies that are categorized as independent contractors, rather than employees, that particular proposition has a payment structure in it for workers that, right now, it is in the courts because the Superior Court declared that unconstitutional.",126,,
846,0.97,6619.679,6622.983,The directory and the long-term outcome of that love remains to be seen.,126,,
847,0.97,6622.983,6629.889,You have a follow member?,127,,
848,0.97,6629.889,6645.138,"Yes, just to understand that come I'm not hearing any other people that have this level of a program yet.",128,,
849,0.97,6645.138,6647.24,I do have a question about the time engaged.,128,,
850,0.97,6647.24,6660.687,"The example you have given was somebody asked to do something an our from now and they start--they start getting paid intermittently, even though they're not en route to the assignment?",128,,
851,0.97,6660.687,6665.625,Correct.,129,,
852,0.97,6665.625,6686.579,"The idea with the two our cut off is that it is a short enough time that it might prevent a worker from engaging in other work, so in that kind of situation, the engaged time would begin immediately upon acceptance of an offer.",129,,
853,0.97,6686.579,6693.219,"If it is one that begins two hours later, then they would have more control over their schedule and engaged time would begin when they started the offer or the agreed-upon time.",129,,
854,0.97,6693.219,6695.255,Thank you for explaining that.,130,,
855,0.97,6695.255,6701.828,"Rate, Councilmember Nelson?",131,,
856,0.97,6701.828,6713.573,"You are muted, Councilmember Nelson.",131,,
857,0.97,6713.573,6714.407,Thank you very much.,132,,
858,0.97,6714.407,6725.118,"I have a couple questions that might bleed a bit into other sections but this is my first time publicly engaging in this, so I want to just to Contextualize these questions with a couple comments.",132,,
859,0.97,6725.118,6738.631,"So, I have been meeting with a variety of Stakeholders, including those representing companies with very different business models, and this is a regulatory framework that is created--it is very wide reaching.",132,,
860,0.97,6738.631,6751.044,It will have very different impacts on different companies according to their business model and different impacts on the workers and the customers.,132,,
861,0.97,6751.044,6773.566,"So, you know, companies have provided a way for small businesses and individual for new words to access customers and expand reach.",132,,
862,0.97,6773.566,6774.4,We know that.,132,,
863,0.97,6774.4,6779.072,I'm talking about restaurants and it is also allowing end users and customers to access a lot more goods and services more easily.,132,,
864,0.97,6779.072,6786.479,"We have seen, during Covid, these platforms have become, you know, a resource, a lifeline, for many small businesses to keep afloat.",132,,
865,0.97,6786.479,6791.351,We have also seen these platforms have kind of shifted from a convenience to a necessity.,132,,
866,0.97,6791.351,6799.225,They have also been helping Billable people like my Mother- In-Law.,132,,
867,0.97,6799.225,6804.797,They're not interacting with the public during the pandemic.,132,,
868,0.97,6804.797,6830.256,"If there is this a function, providing access to food and services, and they have also provided jobs for workers, and that is especially important for people that of gotten laid off during the pandemic, which is just to be Impacting people of color, immigrants, et cetera, whose jobs were less secure.",132,,
869,0.97,6830.256,6831.858,"So, anyway, been up to my question.",132,,
870,0.97,6831.858,6840.833,We know--it builds on Councilmember Pedersen's but because he was asking about Presidents.,132,,
871,0.97,6840.833,6858.084,"I am looking at the fair share, some of the impacts of fair share and we know that fair share increases the cost of a ride by nearly 50% for Uber and Lyft drivers.",132,,
872,0.97,6858.084,6860.653,That is Rideshare--too expensive for some.,132,,
873,0.97,6860.653,6871.898,Drivers now make up words of 160% of the Seattle minimum wage and we have seen a decline in demand for rides.,132,,
874,0.97,6871.898,6883.476,"So, hourly might have gone up, but work available might have gone down or at least that is what I am hearing.",132,,
875,0.97,6883.476,6901.394,The average earnings standard for delivery apt drivers under that would be about 170% of Seattle's minimum wage and let me see--I am supportive of providing workers in the gig economy a livable wage.,132,,
876,0.97,6901.394,6921.881,"My question is, what kind of analysis has been done to anticipate the impacts of increased cost of delivery on small businesses like the restaurants were on drivers if the cost decreases demand for deliveries, and also what are the impacts on low income, verbal end customers who decide they cannot afford the increased delivery fee?",132,,
877,0.97,6921.881,6926.286,There is a lot to impact on pack.,133,,
878,0.97,6926.286,6933.493,I appreciate all those questions.,133,,
879,0.97,6933.493,6968.561,"It helps to begin with the policy purpose of the law, which is to make sure that workers are paid a fair amount for the time that they are engaged in this very vital work, for the network companies--, so with the development of the fair share ordinance, it was learned that certain drivers were earning a little bit less than $10 per hour, and that was an accounting firm with expenses that they were paying for, to do that work.",133,,
880,0.97,6968.561,6978.037,That was one of the things that was motivating that fair share ordinance.,133,,
881,0.97,6978.037,6980.473,The research for outpaced workers has not been done in Seattle.,133,,
882,0.97,6980.473,6996.522,"It has been done in other places, like San Francisco, where it was found that drivers were earning somewhere around six dollars per hour for their work.",133,,
883,0.97,6996.522,6998.057,"Again, not being paid for expenses.",133,,
884,0.97,6998.057,7008.267,"So, the purpose of this proposal is to make sure that there is a guaranteed minimum for payment of work, that corresponds to payment for employees.",133,,
885,0.97,7008.267,7015.308,"So, as with minimum wage, there could be price increases.",133,,
886,0.97,7015.308,7019.178,"I think if one looks to California, yes, there were price increases after proposition 22 went into effect.",133,,
887,0.97,7019.178,7021.147,Price increases in New York City for Tmc.,133,,
888,0.97,7021.147,7031.591,Same thing with Seattle.,133,,
889,0.97,7033.626,7040.166,"I think what has been found thus far is there is a certain amount of elasticity for the services, so customers are still buying them is still doing the rides.",133,,
890,0.97,7040.166,7041.901,They are still ordering to go to be delivered.,133,,
891,0.97,7041.901,7050.743,"Certainly, with Tmc drivers, the Ridership Vomited during Covid-19 without a doubt and that impacted a lot of drivers.",133,,
892,0.97,7050.743,7056.015,Many of them turned to App- based delivery work as another form of earning money.,133,,
893,0.97,7056.015,7061.354,So that kind of exploded for a different kind of work.,133,,
894,0.97,7061.354,7087.346,"Built into the fair share legislation is actually the expectation that companies might take measures to reduce the work opportunities for workers, so that there are fewer workers available for work, so it is promoting more full-time work for drivers, rather than many drivers doing work that is not sustainable with income.",133,,
895,0.97,7087.346,7106.399,"What you are describing happening with fair share, to a certain extent, might have been expected as an expected outcome, as part of that proposal and, in a few years, labor standards will reevaluate the utilization rate for that law, looking at how long drivers are waiting for a ride.",133,,
896,0.97,7106.399,7107.667,Some of that was expected.,133,,
897,0.97,7107.667,7128.955,"As far as prices going up and how about it Fx lower income consumers, I think one thing to note is--I will show you an example of a consumer who was ordering groceries and is the recipient of a snap subsidy for food.",133,,
898,0.97,7128.955,7141.234,"There are options for those particular individuals, where they could--there are some grocery stores that offer store based delivery for those that are using their snap card.",133,,
899,0.97,7141.234,7153.579,"Amazon makes services, delivery services available for individuals using their Ebt card, where they do not have to purchase membership to prime.",133,,
900,0.97,7153.579,7154.847,"However, yes, prices will go up.",133,,
901,0.97,7154.847,7185.778,"This is something that we need to be ready for and companies will figure out how much to pass on to the consumer and how much to absorb and I do not know to what extent one can look at what has happened with the minimum wage, but the same sorts of arguments are in place for the minimum wage as well.",133,,
902,0.97,7185.778,7190.983,"So, it would be interesting to compare and contrast how applicable that research is to the App-Based work and the community as well.",133,,
903,0.97,7190.983,7196.255,"Seattle has been doing well since the minimum wage was put into place, but there were certain companies that were impacted more than others.",133,,
904,0.97,7196.255,7212.238,"I am hearing that--it is something similar to the minimum wage, like what was instituted in San Francisco.",134,,
905,0.97,7212.238,7214.006,"There has not been analysis of that, right?",134,,
906,0.97,7214.006,7218.144,"The San Francisco, the study of what App-Based workers make was separate from minimum payment standards.",135,,
907,0.97,7218.144,7234.393,That was Researched and done by academics and policy folks.,135,,
908,0.97,7238.764,7242.702,"As far as what is happening in California with the increased prices, that would be something to research.",135,,
909,0.97,7242.702,7247.707,I can take note of that and I can see how that is affecting the community and how that is affecting businesses as well.,135,,
910,0.97,7247.707,7248.574,"Okay, thank you.",136,,
911,0.97,7248.574,7249.875,"Thank you so much, Karina.",137,,
912,0.97,7249.875,7252.478,River any other questions for this portion of the presentation?,137,,
913,0.97,7252.478,7272.031,One of the other things Councilmember Nelson raised that is definitely very relevant is the interaction between the restaurants and the platform in terms of the past on costs.,137,,
914,0.97,7272.031,7285.278,"This is actually something, during the pandemic, that they did a lot of work on, just to--we did effectively work together to put a limit on what the fees could be.",137,,
915,0.97,7285.278,7303.062,"To mitigate and limit what a lot of restaurant owners were saying--you know, they were gouging rates of considerable percentages.",137,,
916,0.97,7303.062,7317.243,"So, I think we do probably have some data we can extrapolate from, what the impact of those limits had on the local economy from that regulation being in place for a year.",137,,
917,0.97,7317.243,7335.094,We also have the benefit of having the hazard pay legislation that Councilmember Herbold and I passed in 2020.,137,,
918,0.97,7342.935,7352.878,"You know, it is sort of similar in concept to the things we are discussing, we could probably look to to see how that has affected the market, given that hazard pay has been in place, at this point, for white quite a considerable amount of time.",137,,
919,0.97,7352.878,7357.483,"Between those points, I think this is a good part in the process to check in on what the impact has been.",137,,
920,0.97,7357.483,7363.189,"Obviously, these platforms remain prolific in our local economy.",137,,
921,0.97,7363.189,7389.548,"I do not believe that any of those platforms market or altered the way they operate in response to either of those interventions, but they could offer some assessment and glean some lessons that could be instructive for the broader legislation.",137,,
922,0.97,7389.548,7402.228,I appreciate those comments from Council member Nelson and think there are some ways we can gather some context for that information.,137,,
923,0.97,7402.228,7402.661,Sorry.,138,,
924,0.97,7402.661,7403.763,"Was that you, Councilmember?",138,,
925,0.97,7403.763,7406.699,I am sorry.,138,,
926,0.97,7406.699,7408.4,I should have waited until you finish.,139,,
927,0.97,7408.4,7435.694,"What you did with limiting the delivery fee really did help those restaurants, so I want to commend the Council for doing that, and at the same time, I have no idea how that impacted the workers, if that cut into their pay, the drivers.",139,,
928,0.97,7435.694,7437.83,"So, there are three pieces.",139,,
929,0.97,7437.83,7443.602,"There are the people that are applying the goods that are being delivered, the people that are delivering and the people that are paying the costs.",139,,
930,0.97,7443.602,7462.421,"It is complicated and it is hard to Calibrate, you know, the impacts across the board, but what I am really hearing in some of these other discussions is the business models are very different.",139,,
931,0.97,7462.421,7480.072,"On the one hand, you have Rover--I do none of them make a point--this is the pet care company, platform, and I do not know they make appointments on demand or if they are set up.",139,,
932,0.97,7480.072,7498.557,"I'm not sure if they would be captured by waiting for the job to begin saying, but they are very different because a lot of those folks, this is really a side hustle for a lot of people.",139,,
933,0.97,7498.557,7507.566,Most of them make under $2000 a year on the App.,139,,
934,0.97,7507.566,7524.75,"They often do jobs that are overnight, so the minimum standard for the hourly pay might render their services Unaffordable to your typical people that want to go out of town and need their dogs said.",139,,
935,0.97,7524.75,7540.866,It is different to the delivery of food drivers that are doing a lot of tricks all day long.,139,,
936,0.97,7551.377,7555.848,"That was my point when I mentioned it at the beginning, about complexity of this because of the different business models.",139,,
937,0.97,7555.848,7557.783,Thank you so much for that discussion.,140,,
938,0.97,7557.783,7563.589,"I want to make sure, since we are getting a little late in the morning, that we finish off the presentation and then allow for some last questions.",140,,
939,0.97,7563.589,7567.96,"Is there a little more, Karina?",140,,
940,0.97,7567.96,7569.862,"Yeah, and I can go through it quickly.",140,,
941,0.97,7569.862,7585.511,"Councilmember Nelson, I will add there is a section in the legislation that addresses the situation, where, say for example, someone is spending the night at someone's place, whether to take care of a pet or a person, so the office of labor standards would issue rules on that sort of situation, as what counts is Compensable time versus Off- duty time.",141,,
942,0.97,7585.511,7594.687,That would be something that labor standards can comment on.,141,,
943,0.97,7594.687,7599.191,"The same kind of issue is in the employment context, where there are overnight Healthcare workers in someone's home as well.",141,,
944,0.97,7599.191,7602.394,It is not without precedent and it is complicated by the legislation.,141,,
945,0.97,7602.394,7608.5,"Moving forward, two other pieces of the legislation addressed transparency and more.",141,,
946,0.97,7608.5,7627.953,"Transparency, those requirements would mandate information to workers, so they know what type of offer they are accepting.",141,,
947,0.97,7627.953,7631.056,"They would be able to review that offer for a period of time, three minutes.",141,,
948,0.97,7631.056,7637.196,"They learn about how long it would take an word would take place and what their payment would be and what the physical requirements would be, et cetera.",141,,
949,0.97,7637.196,7649.441,Workers and customers would have the right to electronic receipts after the work is performed and workers would also get weekly statements regarding their earnings.,141,,
950,0.97,7649.441,7662.287,"A 14 day notice to workers before significant change to payment calculations, and then companies would be required to provide information to office of labor standards to help them with enforcement and policymaking as well.",141,,
951,0.97,7662.287,7671.196,That could be determining what the associated time factor would need to be in the future and if it would need to be adjusted.,141,,
952,0.97,7671.196,7701.76,"Flexibility--I think one of the part of the reasons why many choose App-Based work, and the freedom to decide when to work and how long to work and what types of offers to accept or reject, the legislation would layout the workers' rights on these particular matters and they would include the right to cancel an offer.",141,,
953,0.97,7701.76,7710.836,Workers would have the right to do that without being subject to sanctions like Deactivation.,141,,
954,0.97,7710.836,7722.448,They could get the minimum five dollar payment as well.,141,,
955,0.97,7730.122,7735.194,This current draft does reflect a significant amount of policy decision-making by the Council members and I have outlined some of those things here.,141,,
956,0.97,7735.194,7739.398,"I think we are running short on time, so I will see how quickly I can talk about this.",141,,
957,0.97,7739.398,7742.835,"First of all, the previous pay standard was based on what type of offer a worker accepted.",141,,
958,0.97,7742.835,7744.536,It really depends on that On- demand network company.,141,,
959,0.97,7744.536,7760.252,It is like a quick way for the company to know if--for the labor standards to know what the engaged time is and what payment is owed to the worker for that particular type of situation.,141,,
960,0.97,7760.252,7770.262,"Companies are required to pay or ensure a worker receives the certain amount of money, recognizing that sometimes it is a third-party that distributes those payments, rather than the company.",141,,
961,0.97,7770.262,7777.069,The company would still be responsible for making sure that the party paid that required amount.,141,,
962,0.97,7777.069,7777.97,The grace period is new.,141,,
963,0.97,7777.97,7788.28,That is something that is happening with the minimum compensation and they are contemplating a grace period for that.,141,,
964,0.97,7788.28,7794.153,It was added to this ordinance as well.,141,,
965,0.97,7794.153,7811.87,Simplified requirements provide information on the contents of an order--there were specific requirements that companies would need to provide--if it posed a health risk or violated personal beliefs.,141,,
966,0.97,7811.87,7821.88,That is streamlined and the need to pass on what they know about the contents of an order.,141,,
967,0.97,7821.88,7822.447,Updated penalties.,141,,
968,0.97,7822.447,7835.194,"This is simply reflecting that it is no longer 2021 and penalty amounts have been increased to reflect inflation for 2022 and to be consistent with labor standards and, alas, there is no effective date in this draft legislation.",141,,
969,0.97,7835.194,7860.686,"As time moves on, it will reflect 12 months after Council--those 12 months are for office of labor standards to prepare for implementation and they do a whole host of activities while making outreach, translation, coordinating with their community partners.",141,,
970,0.97,7860.686,7866.859,It is a tremendous amount of work.,141,,
971,0.97,7866.859,7870.696,12 months is for other kinds of legislation as well.,141,,
972,0.97,7870.696,7882.708,"This would not be a unique situation and if there are other laws passed as part of this package, those months will be very important and will allow us to prepare.",141,,
973,0.97,7882.708,7901.827,"Next up, they would include introduction, actual introduction of this legislation, and then later on, discussion of other draft bills, such as the ones covering other issues affecting these workers like Deactivation, bathroom access, protections against discrimination, et cetera.",141,,
974,0.97,7901.827,7906.999,So that is the end of the presentation.,141,,
975,0.97,7906.999,7908.367,I'm happy to answer any more questions.,141,,
976,0.97,7908.367,7916.208,Any questions regarding that last section of the presentation?,142,,
977,0.97,7916.208,7917.276,"Okay, I am seeing none.",142,,
978,0.97,7917.276,7938.897,"Just to give a couple wrap of comments on this, this is still--as we mentioned at the beginning, still a draft of an introduced legislation.",142,,
979,0.97,7938.897,7940.766,"So, this is still in a fairly early process.",142,,
980,0.97,7940.766,7953.278,"Obviously, Amy and Karina will make themselves available to Council members who want to learn more about the legislation and want to explore some of these policy areas Offline.",142,,
981,0.97,7953.278,7958.25,"So, this is a good opportunity to get an update to the public Úand to committee members on where these discussions are heading.",142,,
982,0.97,7958.25,7979.338,"I do want to flag that Councilmember Herbold has hosted dozens of meetings to date, involving lots of Stakeholders in this process since the beginning of this year and then throughout last year, quite an extensive Stakeholder process as well.",142,,
983,0.97,7979.338,7986.044,"Obviously, this has been put on hold for the budget process.",142,,
984,0.97,7986.044,7994.486,It is now--it has taken up again and I am sure that Councilmember Herbold will be back in person to address that.,142,,
985,0.97,7994.486,7996.221,That will be when she makes a recovery.,142,,
986,0.97,7996.221,8006.698,I look forward to continuing this discussion and this conversation.,142,,
987,0.97,8006.698,8010.569,"The next steps--we just indicated, the Stakeholder conversations will continue, even after legislation is introduced.",142,,
988,0.97,8010.569,8030.122,We always know there is an extensive consideration of amendment process and I certainly anticipate Council members both in this Committee and the whole Council will have some issues they want to raise Andrew into with more detail.,142,,
989,0.97,8030.122,8043.869,"There is really a hope that we can continue to refine the legislation and craft a policy that is going to work for businesses, including, you know, the restaurants as we discussed through--providing the substance of the delivery and the platform.",142,,
990,0.97,8043.869,8053.545,And also provides workers with benefits and protections similarly situated for workers who do Non-Gig work currently.,142,,
991,0.97,8053.545,8076.501,"And they want to make sure this new and emergent field of gig economy work is not somehow treated differently with different standards than how we otherwise treat traditional wage and more permanent work, not delivered on these App- based platforms.",142,,
992,0.97,8076.501,8077.035,A good discussion.,142,,
993,0.97,8077.035,8086.812,"Thank you so much to central staff for answering our questions and giving that presentation, including any.",142,,
994,0.97,8086.812,8088.513,Thank you for organizing a great policy process.,142,,
995,0.97,8088.513,8091.983,We really appreciate your service and I know I speak for the whole Committee on that.,142,,
996,0.97,8091.983,8107.966,"Moving forward here, to adjournment, is there anything for the good of the order before we adjourn the committee this morning?",142,,
997,0.97,8107.966,8108.4,Thank you.,142,,
998,0.97,8108.4,8110.969,"Thank you, everyone, for bearing with me filling in as vice chair.",142,,
999,0.97,8110.969,8113.972,You will not try to make a habit of this.,142,,
1000,0.97,8113.972,8121.079,"We all wish, me more than anyone else, so I don't have to chair two committees, speedy recovery to Councilmember Herbold.",142,,
1001,0.97,8121.079,8125.45,"With that, we will adjourn and I hope you all had a good afternoon.",142,,
