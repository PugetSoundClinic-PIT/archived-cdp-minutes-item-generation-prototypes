228,0.97,2190.254,2201.098,First will be--first item on the agenda is legislation transmitted by the Department of education and early learning related to the families education preschool and promised levy.,28,,
229,0.97,2201.098,2228.292,This legislation will come to us so that it will allow a better opportunity to administer it the levy dollars as the pandemic demands continue to require us to adapt and be flexible in how we serve Seattle families who are now remote learning as opposed to learning on-site and in person.,28,,

232,0.97,2235.032,2245.876,The second item is legislation related to robbing regulations so this legislation comes to us from the Seattle ethics and elections Commission.,28,,
233,0.97,2245.876,2263.127,They are requesting that we consider making three changes to the lobbying regulations that currently exist at the city of Seattle central staff policy analyst [Indiscernible] ended Circlet memo to all of the members of the committee last week.,28,,
234,0.97,2263.127,2269.533,That memo details exactly what this legislation does.,28,,
235,0.97,2269.533,2271.068,"Again, just three primary things.",28,,
236,0.97,2271.068,2338.636,"One it requires directors and deputy directors and direct reports to, if there is lobbying of those individuals then lobbyists will have to register that lobbying activity . The other item that it covers is requiring or establishing grassroots lobbying regulations in the city of Seattle but nearer what currently exists at the state of Washington . that is probably going to be the most significant change for folks in our city so this will require folks who spend $750 in a month or $1500 in a Three- month period on lobbying members of the public for purposes of influencing legislation and policy or other decisions before us . It will require those sponsors as defined by the legislation to now disclose that lobbying activity . It does not prevent people from continuing to engage in grassroots lobbying.",28,,
237,0.97,2338.636,2360.124,It will just simply require additional disclosure requirements for purposes of transparency and understanding members of the public as to who is funding what's grassroots lobbying efforts and activities and work that is designed to influence decision-making at the city of Seattle.,28,,

242,0.97,2387.785,2400.965,The third thing that this bill will require is it will require disclosure by registered lobbyists for compensated work that is done for political campaigns.,28,,
243,0.97,2400.965,2419.65,In effect this bill is cleaning up and requiring additional registration reporting in two categories and establishing a new registration and reporting regiment as relates to grassroots lobbying.,28,,
244,0.97,2419.65,2435.299,Look referring to in hosting the director of the ethics Commission and the commissions of current chair who is Nicholas Brown at our Tuesday meeting of the government and education committee to have more conversation about that propose legislation.,28,,

First up is Council bills 119966, which is the legal representation of Mayor Jenny Durkan and court proceedings concerning recall [Indiscernible]. This is Unsponsored legislation developed by the city attorney's office at the request of Mayor Durkan.",28,,
249,0.97,2492.389,2532.963,"It's very similar in nature to Council bill 119891 related to the legal defense of Councilmember Sawant which the council voted to pass on September 15. according to the note attached the Mayor's legal fees in the case totaled approximately $240,000 . The Mayor is now seeking to avail herself of the statutory provisions that we rely on in these instances to seek reimbursement of the total sum of those legal fees that were related to her recall litigation.",28,,
250,0.97,2532.963,2539.036,"I expect that this legislation will be on the city council agenda for next Monday, December 14.",28,,
251,0.97,2539.036,2547.545,"If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office or directly to Jessica Needleman at the city attorney's office.",28,,

Some of you may have seen that last week the city announced legislation for restaurants and bar relief in particular in response to the latest round of restrictions and announced by Governor Jay Inslee . again, fueled by his deep desire to curve the surgeon Covid-19 infections.",28,,
261,0.97,2708.105,2718.015,"Of course, we know these rejections are necessary at this point in order to continue to try to get the surgeon Covid- 19 infections under control.",28,,

267,0.97,2829.626,2890.754,"Of course, we know they need is pretty dire and so my hope is we will be able to vote it out of the Finance and has a committee this week for councils for consideration on December 14 and I would be Remiss in saying that my ultimate hope is that Congress will actually step up and deliver on a massive scale relief bill for both all of the millions of workers who are at work right now and also for our small businesses who are trying to stay afloat so that workers who are currently Laid-Off have something to come back to but until then cities and local governments have a very unique opportunity to make smart strategic targeted investment towards industries that have been specifically and disproportionately impacted and am happy that this bill will hopefully help to provide some relief to the hospitality workers and restaurants and bars, small restaurants and bars throughout our city.",28,,
268,0.97,2890.754,2910.674,The last bill that is on the introduction referral already spoke to relates to the 2018 levy flexibility . We are calling it the flexibility legislation so that's on today's IRC and I spoke about this morning so there's no need to Belabor here.,28,,

272,0.97,2925.589,2931.094,Just a quick question about the worker assistance bill.,29,,
273,0.97,2931.094,2942.606,I had originally heard it was focused on restaurant and service industry.,29,,
274,0.97,2942.606,2943.74,I hear you mentioning hospitality industry.,29,,
275,0.97,2943.74,2955.619,Does that mean hotel workers who do not work at small hotels will be eligible for assistance or is this only for the employees of--the workers at small businesses?,29,,
276,0.97,2955.619,2975.072,This is specifically designed for workers at small businesses and the does have to be access between financial loss with the worker and the small business.,30,,
277,0.97,2975.072,2983.046,News the hospitality industry are really--are there--small,31,,
278,0.97,2983.046,2985.482,I may be loose with my language.,32,,
279,0.97,2985.482,3003.166,The intent is to focus specifically on workers of small businesses first and foremost as a big filter and we are looking at focusing specifically on those workers who have been negatively impacted economically by the Covid-19 restrictions that have disproportionately impacted restaurants and bars.,32,,
280,0.97,3003.166,3029.626,"Now, it is the case that in some instances there could be some smaller shop businesses that are Co-Located in hotels and I certainly wouldn't want to preclude those workers from being able to access some of the relief if those businesses have experienced some financial impacts . will talk eventually small businesses not, not large franchises.",32,,
281,0.97,3029.626,3053.15,I totally get that for the assistance to the business I but for the workers' side to be have an analysis that shows that people who in the service industry and in the hospitality industry that work at large businesses are not suffering as much as those same workforce working at small businesses?,33,,
282,0.97,3053.15,3063.727,I'm not sure I'm following your question.,34,,
283,0.97,3063.727,3090.086,You refer to this as being targeted relief and I just want to make sure that we are targeting the relief to the workers most in need and I don't know of an analysis that shows that workers who work in the service and hospitality industry who work for small businesses are suffering more than that same workforce working for large businesses.,35,,
284,0.97,3090.086,3099.663,"I don't have any sort of longitudinal studies that I can point to you, point you to.",36,,
285,0.97,3099.663,3112.943,"I do now that the unemployment numbers tell a story about who is being, you know, pretty significantly impact on the workers' side in terms of an employment rates.",36,,
286,0.97,3112.943,3157.32,We know that for restaurant and bar workers that number is hugely significant in comparison to other industries and so I think because we are trying to focus on the relief I'm being a dovetail to the recent round of restrictions that the governor has imposed that specifically prohibit indoor dining so that impacts restaurants and bars specifically if you don't have any outdoor space and can't shift your model and so that's why we are focusing on restaurant workers and bar workers in particular.,36,,
287,0.97,3157.32,3173.737,"I am not aware of this latest round of restrictions restricting further restricting hotels for example, or other large businesses or small businesses frankly who still have outdoor dining.",36,,
288,0.97,3173.737,3198.361,We are trying to focus the strategies and target the strategies through the lens of this latest round of restrictions imposed by Governor Jay Inslee which unquestionably have a more profound impact on restaurants and bars cannot afford indoor--who cannot provide indoor dining by virtue of how their business model is structured.,36,,
289,0.97,3198.361,3198.862,Okay.,37,,
290,0.97,3198.862,3203.066,I think I understand the nexus here.,37,,
291,0.97,3203.066,3228.291,It's related also to the size of the business is what you're saying because of the inability again smaller business Footprint to still stay open and employ people unlike in larger businesses you sound like you're singing larger business they are able to do that because of the larger Floorplan.,37,,
292,0.97,3228.291,3230.66,Thanks for walking me through that.,37,,
293,0.97,3230.66,3231.294,Appreciate it.,37,,
294,0.97,3231.294,3246.61,Is the function of the larger Workplan and the fact that some of the larger businesses may have outdoor space that they can shift their dining model to . a lot of our small businesses don't have that.,38,,
295,0.97,3246.61,3252.015,The reality is we are doing business in the city of Santa Ana where outdoor space dining space is a bit of a luxury in normal times.,38,,
296,0.97,3252.015,3262.826,How may times have we been asking ourselves whether we find a rooftop deck where we can go have happy hour and come up with [Indiscernible]'s I think that's a reality.,38,,
297,0.97,3262.826,3290.053,The infrastructure of her Brick- And-Mortar and the city of Seattle is really fundamentally designed and oriented toward indoor dining and bar patronage and so we are trying to focus on those individuals and those businesses and their workers who just literally don't have the physical space to shift their model toward outdoor dining.,38,,
