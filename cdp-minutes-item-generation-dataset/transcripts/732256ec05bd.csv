380,0.97,2457.788,2471.602,Another reason for the delay was related to Washington's pollution liability insurance agencies new heating oil loan and grant program.,93,,
381,0.97,2471.602,2494.258,"What had been discussed as a grant program last year now sounds like it might be going to a loan program and so replacing these oil tanks can cost tens of thousands of dollars . for low income families, this is a real challenge no matter how eager they may be to participate in a conversion.",93,,
382,0.97,2494.258,2518.482,"June 1ST of this year, the office of Sustainability provided an update to the heating oil loan program and based on feedback from customers and others, and because those final rules have not yet been put in place, OEC is proposing we delay another six months before this tax becomes in effect.",93,,

392,0.97,2588.819,2598.162,I will be voting yes on this legislation to delay the implementation of the heating oil tax that Mayor Durkan first proposed a year and half ago.,95,,
393,0.97,2598.162,2613.577,The climate emergency is a threat to all of humanity and we must have a serious and internationalist approach to ending greenhouse gas emissions and in this case Unfortunately the heating oil tax is not a serious approach.,95,,
394,0.97,2613.577,2623.754,"Yes, heating oil is a terrible fuel but the reality is people in Seattle do not need a tax to notify them to switch away from heating oil.",95,,
395,0.97,2623.754,2625.322,"It is expensive, dirty, and inconvenient.",95,,
396,0.97,2625.322,2637.101,"The main reason people still use oil burning heaters in Seattle is when they're simply unable to afford to switch to something better, ideally electricity.",95,,
397,0.97,2637.101,2646.01,"My office discussed with the city of Seattle and confirmed with their outreach, they found it is overwhelmingly poor and working-class households that have oil heaters.",95,,

399,0.97,2652.983,2662.526,"Ultimately that means the proposed climate solution is yet another Regressive tax, which is not a surprise . It is very dangerous.",95,,
400,0.97,2662.526,2677.675,"Not only does the tax have a very small impact on the climate, it also adds to the false narrative of blaming consumers and ordinary people for the climate emergency that led to the big businesses response for greenhouse gas emissions.",95,,
401,0.97,2677.675,2680.01,We need the opposite.,95,,
402,0.97,2680.01,2719.383,We need measure that will actually change the way corporations are functioning and ultimately what we need is a climate justice movement nationwide and internationally that can take fossil fuel companies into Democratic public ownership . We need to fight for policies on the way to achieving all of those larger goals which frankly are urgently needed . that is why the Amazon tax movement fought big businesses to find a new agreement for Seattle to make funding available for people for Weatherization and to get away from fossil fuels.,95,,
403,0.97,2719.383,2729.159,"It includes a substantial 20 million climate infrastructure investment paid for by taxes on big businesses, not on working people.",95,,
404,0.97,2729.159,2743.974,Of course $20 million is far less than is needed because the Amazon tax was significantly reduced when it was Rebranded as Jumpstart and an attempt to minimize the grassroots movement.,95,,
405,0.97,2743.974,2753.951,"If organizers are motivated to try to increase the Amazon tax next year to expand investments for dealing with the climate crisis, then we should absolutely be fighting for that.",95,,
406,0.97,2753.951,2768.398,My office will obviously be standing with them . The city needs to support the pipeline movement's demand to boycott the financial institutions and insurance companies that fund fossil fuel infrastructure.,95,,
407,0.97,2768.398,2771.802,This is an excellent example of policies that we need to do in the here and now.,95,,
408,0.97,2771.802,2787.851,My office asks the chair rights committee to prepare legislation to empower the green new deal oversight board to review and rank financial institutions and insurance companies applying for city of Seattle grants.,95,,

556,0.97,3545.408,3580.71,"As a reminder, 62% of the Jumpstart funds go to affordable housing, including housing serving households at or above 30% needed income, a portion is set aside for community focus acquisition and housing to address discriminatory practices and policies such as Redlining and restricting and making sure there are more first time home ownership options especially for those that have suffered displacement.",175,,

563,0.97,3661.09,3703.132,"And invest in job training options for transition with specific emphasis on outreach to create pathways for good green Union jobs and this, again, has a disproportionate impact for our--we are experiencing the highest rates of environmental injustice in our communities, those who have been impacted by heat waves show that our communities are in neighborhoods that have been previously Redlined and are disproportionately impacted--exposed to all types of air pollution.",175,,
564,0.97,3703.132,3722.685,"We can make investments by investments that are outlined here in the Jumpstart Seattle proposal, and I am excited to see this legislation move forward with a heavy investment on emphasis.",175,,
565,0.97,3722.685,3731.661,Looking at opportunities for greater diversity among our local economies so we improve the overall stability.,175,,
566,0.97,3731.661,3753.75,"There are two important components in this legislation that would happen today, one is it includes that we can look at the funds if there is incredible shortfalls in our projected Covid-19 baseline projections for revenues in 2022 and beyond, that is smart to do budgetary leaks and helps set us up for both success with ours and plan and the case we have the ability to be flexible.",175,,
567,0.97,3753.75,3781.01,"And we have also held legislation with the exact language that our Council passed last year, which was a desire to set up an oversight board with the inclusion of community at the table, so that there is updates to counsel and a direct oversight component to make sure these dollars are being spent in the right way.",175,,

621,0.97,4059.288,4082.611,"I am excited to be voting on this legislation today after nearly nine months of collaborative negotiations with the executive to develop this legislation, I believe establishing the office of economic and revenue forecast will create a more open, transparent, and robust casting process that will enhance both the Council's and the public access to and understanding of the city's budgetary forecast.",211,,
622,0.97,4082.611,4099.962,The implementation should also improve the Dynamics between future councils and future mayors by building a stronger foundation of trust and balance between the branches as it relates to the development of the city's budget priorities.,211,,
623,0.97,4099.962,4113.943,"There are two permanent events that highlighted, for me, and many others, how important it is to level the playing field between the Council and the Mayor's office.",211,,
624,0.97,4113.943,4129.558,"Those events prompted me, my staff, and central staff to look at alternative models for how governments and parties develop budget forecasts, and both Washington State and King County utilize independent forecasting offices that are outside of the legislative and executive ranges.",211,,
625,0.97,4129.558,4137.266,"Kingman County one so far as to pursue a voter approved amendment in 2008, in order to create their office of economic and financial analysis.",211,,
626,0.97,4137.266,4158.621,"Ultimately, based on mine and central staff's review, we at the city council are able to establish our own independent office in a manner consistent with our city charter and the legislation we are voting on is reflective of all of the feedback we received from the city attorney's review and their legal advice.",211,,
627,0.97,4158.621,4181.343,"Upon its creation, the economic revenue forecast office would provide independent forecasts and economic analysis, fulfilling the policy intent of the Council budget action this counsel previously took and that was included in the 2021 budget that was adopted.",211,,
628,0.97,4181.343,4189.118,It would also consist of 3 1/2 full-time equivalents through a combination of newly created positions and transfer positions from our city budget office and to finance and administrative services.,211,,
629,0.97,4189.118,4203.732,"This would be headed by a director who would be hired by and report to a new forecast counsel comprised of the Mayor, the city Finance director, the Council President, and Council budget chair or their respective designees.",211,,
630,0.97,4203.732,4207.369,The forecast counsel would be responsible for providing oversight of the new office and for approving the forecast.,211,,
631,0.97,4207.369,4221.55,The Governance and education committee did have a conversation and presentation on this particular proposed piece of legislation and unanimously recommended the counsel bill be passed and adopted by the full council.,211,,

635,0.97,4234.697,4287.016,"I will be supporting this legislation today, I think this is a smart choice to remove, to create an, a forecast office that is not tied to either the executive or counsel, I am going to take this moment to really share Kudos to the city budget office last year during the recession and reopening of our economy, because as compared to the state level, the city budget office really did an amazing job of making accurate Depictions we could work off of compared to the state that had a bigger drop and a bigger rebound, so I know that we have the tools and I know our city budget office is doing great work and I think this new legislation is the next great step, thank you.",212,,
636,0.97,4287.016,4287.816,Really appreciate that.,213,,

639,0.97,4297.526,4338.767,"The intent the counsel expressed to your leadership during the budget discussions last year to create this independent office, this is, I think, considered a best practice, and really appreciate knowing that, moving forward, whether or not it is, at times, when there are increased revenue forecasts or potential reductions in revenue, that the Council will have access to that information as opposed to the current practice where often we find it out at the same time, when there are budget proposals to cut or add.",214,,
640,0.97,4338.767,4350.713,"It will allow us as the body tat is most responsive, engaged with the public to give input to those budget discussions and decisions.",214,,

642,0.97,4357.086,4425.687,"I wanted to also explain my support for this new office, there were some articles written about this proposal recently that Dell would into legal issues and looking at the city Charter, I think that was healthy to raise these issues, I did additional research, got additional comfort with that aspect of it from a practical standpoint, having worked for a budget chair many years ago, the timing of these forecasts is also, it has been a source of frustration, so, I think it is important to have both branches collaborating on this data about what the revenues are going to be, how we are predicting them and having that information at the same time, so that the legislative branch isn't sitting around waiting, when is this information going to come so we can figure out how to make decisions since we ultimately have to adopt the budget and decide whether to amend it.",215,,
643,0.97,4425.687,4440.235,"I was really pleased when you brought this proposal up, the more due diligence I have done, it seems like it is going to be good for the city that we have this information at the same time, both executive and legislative branches.",215,,

646,0.97,4447.876,4478.54,"I am not seeing any other hands raised, I will go ahead and close this out, I think Council member Pedersen stole the words right out of my mouth, that is the note I wanted to end on, I think that, as the budget appropriation authority, it has seemed odd to me in the six years I have served on counsel too often times feel like we are caught on the back of our heels when receiving revenue forecast changes in the middle of, and sometimes towards the end of our budgeting process.",216,,
