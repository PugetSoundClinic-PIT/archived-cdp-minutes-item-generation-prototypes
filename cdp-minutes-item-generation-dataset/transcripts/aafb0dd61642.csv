14,0.97,115.048,129.629,I want to take a quick second to acknowledge it all the individuals and families who have lost their lives in the individuals who are also ill and are in the good care of the health team and in the careful watch.,0,,

22,0.97,186.286,203.836,Lastly we want to remind folks that if you feel ill in any way or have a fever or cough or the chills and we want to make sure that you stay home it is hard to say that when I know a lot of people have to go to work but the good thing about our initiative is that everyone has sick and safe leave.,0,,
23,0.97,203.836,214.814,If you fear retaliation you can reach out to our office of labor standards for greater clarification about how to access your paid sick and safe days.,0,,

38,0.97,312.045,332.932,I sent a letter to the Mayor that as elected officials we should be urging the insurance industry and hospital industry that they should not have Co- pays and other payments so people can actually get tested so we can keep this under containment.,1,,

191,0.97,1271.003,1277.009,The director has led it since he Department was King created in 2015.,21,,
192,0.97,1277.009,1285.484,Prior to this reorganization that established it he worked as the deputy director and the Department of planning and development.,21,,
193,0.97,1285.484,1290.722,He has worked with a wide variety of roles since he started in 1990.,21,,
194,0.97,1290.722,1306.138,He has shown leadership throughout recent development resulting in high permitting volumes while also working . We asked a lot of question of the director both in writing and in committee.,21,,
195,0.97,1306.138,1315.747,So many we initially broke his reappointment process into two different committee hearings.,21,,
196,0.97,1315.747,1321.82,Nathan Torgelson you answered our questions sufficiently and with High-Caliber answers.,21,,
197,0.97,1321.82,1335.033,Your ability to meet us and discuss each of the questions that was asked of you in such depth was really meaningful to me.,21,,
198,0.97,1335.033,1348.647,"Many of these questions focused on the permitting process and timing about protecting trees, permitting trees, Affordability and equity and so much more.",21,,
199,0.97,1348.647,1354.086,I am really looking for to working with you on all of these issues.,21,,

205,0.97,1377.275,1385.217,I want to say I can attest to chairman Strauss.,23,,
206,0.97,1385.217,1389.354,He was able to answer my questions.,23,,
207,0.97,1389.354,1394.726,I voted to send Nathan Torgelson for confirmation.,23,,
208,0.97,1394.726,1395.994,I intend to vote for him today.,23,,
209,0.97,1395.994,1397.696,I want to make a couple comments.,23,,
210,0.97,1397.696,1405.103,Want to address my general philosophy of this reappointment.,23,,
211,0.97,1405.103,1416.047,Executive appointment in general and maybe addressing just for the record some of the criticism I have heard from constituents about the city's recent development policies.,23,,
212,0.97,1416.047,1428.46,Just backing up I wanted to say it is my personal belief that the Mayor has a great deal of latitude in executive appointments.,23,,
213,0.97,1428.46,1436.168,The Mayor is subject to election and the Mayor is elected based on promises and programs to deliver by the voters in the city.,23,,
214,0.97,1436.168,1446.178,The Mayor deserves to have executive appointments if they are qualified to enact and pursue the things the Mayor promised to deliver on.,23,,
215,0.97,1446.178,1451.183,We have an oversight requirement to make sure those nominees are qualified.,23,,
216,0.97,1451.183,1457.189,The first thing I will say is Nathan Torgelson is very qualified.,23,,
217,0.97,1457.189,1466.865,"We as a city are very fortunate to have someone in terms of educational background, he has a masters degree in urban planning.",23,,
218,0.97,1466.865,1478.41,"He has 30 years of demonstrated public-policy experience, mostly in the city of Seattle.",23,,
219,0.97,1478.41,1498.296,During my transition I can personally attest that the director and his Department have been a great resource for getting me up to speed to be prepared to be a Councilmember and work with the Department on a lot of the policies that we look forward to working on together as a counsel and a administration.,23,,
220,0.97,1498.296,1503.802,That was attested to during the public comment.,23,,
221,0.97,1503.802,1526.958,The developers are doing great work to scale up the opportunities and workforce housing to make sure if you live in the city or work in the city you can continue to live in the city which is definitely something that is not a certain prospect going forward based on the inequality that has been growing.,23,,
222,0.97,1526.958,1536.735,It has been good to have that cooperation from the director.,23,,
223,0.97,1536.735,1574.506,"Based on that I'm definitely prepared to vote to confirm him . I guess my only comment would be to the folks that have Emailed me expressing concerns about current development patterns in the city, to the folks who have contacted my office and essentially are concerned about the impact of development on tree canopy, neighborhood the ability concerns, neighborhood character, I think those are political questions that are left to the next time we have elections for Mayor.",23,,
224,0.97,1574.506,1593.024,At that point those concerns can be expressed and pursued with the executive agency heads that we appoint are there to enact the policy regardless of who the policymakers setting them is.,23,,
225,0.97,1593.024,1595.327,Nathan Torgelson is qualified and has answered all my questions.,23,,
226,0.97,1595.327,1598.53,I think he deserves my confirmation vote based on that.,23,,
227,0.97,1598.53,1601.733,I intend to do that.,23,,
228,0.97,1601.733,1602.934,Thank you very much.,24,,
229,0.97,1602.934,1608.039,Your points are well taken.,24,,
230,0.97,1608.039,1612.644,In your comments?,24,,
231,0.97,1612.644,1644.576,"I want to think Nathan Torgelson for his long-term dedicated public service to the city, it is important for us to recognize the Department heads in our city who work very hard and even if we have disagreements with them about certain policies to treat them with respect, we want to retain our public servants so they continue to serve our city.",25,,
232,0.97,1644.576,1649.681,I had Abstained because I was still working my way through all of the questions and answers because we had given him a lot in advance.,25,,
233,0.97,1649.681,1675.673,I wanted to flag some concerns raised by my constituents about mandatory housing of what ability making sure we honor the goal that passed Mha which is to have more on-site development of affordable housing Sodas economically integrated in all of our communities and built faster than waiting for the funding.,25,,
234,0.97,1675.673,1679.31,There is a goal of 50-50 for the on-site development of affordable housing.,25,,

236,0.97,1682.48,1702.133,Concern that the private sector real estate developer are ripping up trees and the Seattle apartment of construction and inspection is not using its full of 30 to protect those larger Conifers that have a strong environmental health and social justice benefits to our city.,25,,
237,0.97,1702.133,1711.009,Finally looking at the lens of preventing displacement.,25,,
238,0.97,1711.009,1712.844,We are seeing the city grow so quickly.,25,,
239,0.97,1712.844,1715.08,We are seeing displacement from all different areas of the city.,25,,
240,0.97,1715.08,1720.752,We are making sure that they join other departments looking at it through that lens.,25,,
241,0.97,1720.752,1728.927,Whether that is collecting data to see where we are you losing it through housing or other means.,25,,
242,0.97,1728.927,1736.835,I had a nice conversation with the director after the meeting and I will be voting yes on his confirmation.,25,,
243,0.97,1736.835,1739.437,Thank you very much.,26,,
244,0.97,1739.437,1741.773,Any additional comments?,26,,

246,0.97,1748.179,1766.498,I want to say that Nathan and I have had several conversations about racial equity and my frustration with the fact that it is not part of the conversation is looking through development processes . There is no place where we get to ask the question how will people of color be impacted?,27,,
247,0.97,1766.498,1773.671,Will displacement occur and we have not solved that problem yet.,27,,
248,0.97,1773.671,1780.078,I want to thank you for your willingness to have that conversation and being creative in thinking about how we can insert the conversation somewhere.,27,,
249,0.97,1780.078,1782.914,That is to be determined.,27,,
250,0.97,1782.914,1791.623,The other issue I think is really important and is a concern we both share is what to do about the Unreinforced masonry buildings.,27,,
251,0.97,1791.623,1802.0,"We have 20,000 people living in buildings that are at a huge risk when the earthquake happens that we know will happen in the city.",27,,
