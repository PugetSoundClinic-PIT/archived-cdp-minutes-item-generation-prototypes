63,0.97,307.173,314.18,And having relationship with fewer and fewer neighbors as my time became swept in other things.,1,,
64,0.97,314.18,316.983,Became a problem it was difficult to name.,1,,
65,0.97,316.983,323.122,Transit was $5 out of my pocket every time Iimented to--I wanted to see someone.,1,,
66,0.97,323.122,326.793,While it sounds like little money.,1,,
67,0.97,326.793,328.227,It is also a barrier.,1,,
68,0.97,328.227,337.837,"When you know you could save $5, in the city of Seattle, this turns many of us into Shut- INS.",1,,
69,0.97,337.837,340.74,It wasn't until recently that I got a job to pay for it.,1,,

83,0.97,389.856,401.367,Because transit is an issue that touches every worker and the support amongst the different unions for this policy has been powerful and unanimous.,5,,
84,0.97,401.367,401.801,Okay.,6,,
85,0.97,401.801,402.034,Hi.,7,,

90,0.97,426.826,431.097,We all know the housing and rental prices have soared in King County.,7,,
91,0.97,431.097,435.468,The wages range from $15.50 to $18 an hour.,7,,
92,0.97,435.468,443.442,"Most employees, especially suppose with families Cannotafford to live in the city, let alone the county.",7,,
93,0.97,443.442,451.617,And using sound transit bus Tomethrow adds.,7,,
94,0.97,451.617,457.89,This adds up to $1188 a year for a Metro Orca monthly pass.,7,,
95,0.97,457.89,461.961,It's $1836 for an Intercounty monthly Orca pass.,7,,
96,0.97,461.961,471.971,"And using the sounder train, the regional monthly Orca passes range from $180 to $207 for $2167 to $2484 a year.",7,,
97,0.97,471.971,473.172,Depending on the station used.,7,,
98,0.97,473.172,476.275,That is not a Supportable situation.,7,,
99,0.97,476.275,478.311,Especially without warning.,7,,
100,0.97,478.311,480.146,Many people choose to drive.,7,,
101,0.97,480.146,482.014,They're already paying for their cars.,7,,
102,0.97,482.014,487.854,"But now they have the added cost of gas, maintenance, good to go passes and street parking.",7,,
103,0.97,487.854,492.825,Our office is not in the best neighborhood with open drug use.,7,,
104,0.97,492.825,494.16,In the last three weeks.,7,,
105,0.97,494.16,497.997,Four of my coworkers have had their cars broken into.,7,,
106,0.97,497.997,502.502,And their windows smashed out.,7,,
107,0.97,502.502,503.603,Street parking fares have increased.,7,,
108,0.97,503.603,510.343,"In addition, there are game Dys when almost no parking can be found and prices soar.",7,,
109,0.97,510.343,516.282,"We've had people frightened to go to their cars, wait for others to go in pairs.",7,,
110,0.97,516.282,519.886,Our office is about 85% female.,7,,
111,0.97,519.886,521.52,We're a 24/7 operation this.,7,,
112,0.97,521.52,525.391,Also requires employees to leave their stations and go move their cars every two hours.,7,,
113,0.97,525.391,526.826,This is not good for our teams.,7,,
114,0.97,526.826,529.295,And it's not good for our clients.,7,,
115,0.97,529.295,532.532,But there aren't any alternatives.,7,,
116,0.97,532.532,536.369,I've canceled every nonessential service in order to fit the cost of Orca into my budget.,7,,
117,0.97,536.369,547.246,"This Rebudgetting has been difficult for so many of us, especially if like me, you have a disability, which inevitably means a lot of medical debt to pay off.",7,,
118,0.97,547.246,552.485,"We've had Highly-Skilled Tenured employees who love their job with a wealth of knowledge, leave.",7,,
119,0.97,552.485,561.494,It's emotionally exhausting to scramble for change when your bank could balance is too low to purchase an Orca ticket.,7,,
120,0.97,561.494,567.5,I often wonder what the driver would think when I eventually have to pay with pennies.,7,,
121,0.97,567.5,569.735,But an extension of that.,7,,
122,0.97,569.735,576.475,"To operate with limited Street parking, even more limited parking garages or lots.",7,,
123,0.97,576.475,579.445,And one parking spot per nine employees.,7,,
124,0.97,579.445,589.655,To refuse to support public transportation for your own employees shows a blatant disregard for welfare and potential for skilled workers.,7,,
125,0.97,589.655,592.992,"Good afternoon, Council members.",8,,

133,0.97,617.216,622.288,Which includes low carbon methods of transportation.,8,,
134,0.97,622.288,633.065,"This can happen by ensuring that public transit is reliable, frequent and Incentivized.",8,,
135,0.97,633.065,638.337,Asi have personally relied on public transit to get to and from work for over eight years.,8,,

152,0.97,686.552,688.254,And neighborhoods more vibrant.,11,,

154,0.97,691.123,692.324,And they're walking with each other.,11,,
155,0.97,692.324,698.731,"In that future, we believe our people are healthier and happier.",11,,
156,0.97,698.731,705.805,We see Orca for all as a critical and common sense first step towards realizing that healthy future.,11,,
157,0.97,705.805,709.775,And I'm also here because I know we're facing a climate emergency.,11,,
158,0.97,709.775,715.981,Ask we are in a critical time to act.,11,,

191,0.97,833.332,837.136,And it's just not enough money.,14,,
192,0.97,837.136,844.643,And I really appreciate that the city council is holding these meetings to let people come and explain that.,14,,
193,0.97,844.643,853.619,"And I was laid off by President restaurant industry and had to turn to gig work, pretty much full time.",14,,
194,0.97,853.619,855.754,I'm still pull being 32 to 40 hours per week.,14,,
195,0.97,855.754,859.091,And I work at nights when my children are asleep.,14,,
196,0.97,859.091,870.169,"It's very important to me because if it wasn't for the gig work, I would not be able to have any money, probably be homeless, living in a tent, underneath the bridge.",14,,
197,0.97,870.169,879.278,"But with that, I'm only making about $3 to $4 per delivery with post mates and you need 5 to cash out.",14,,
198,0.97,879.278,892.458,"Which means I have to do two orders with them before I can even make any money, put that back into the gas tank so I can keep going to do another two orders, put money in the gas tank, do another two orders.",14,,
199,0.97,892.458,897.196,"So to make money, I have to work when they offer the Bonusses during the time they offer it.",14,,
200,0.97,897.196,898.464,And it's just not enough.,14,,
201,0.97,898.464,904.837,So I just wanted to say that customers are willing to pay workers enough for it to be worth it for us.,14,,
202,0.97,904.837,911.91,And raising standards in the gig economy will benefit families like mine and our economy as a whole.,14,,
203,0.97,911.91,915.547,I'm looking forward to working with city Council to make these changes.,14,,
204,0.97,915.547,915.848,Thank you.,14,,
205,0.97,915.848,917.316,Wonderful.,15,,
206,0.97,917.316,927.426,Mary?,15,,
207,0.97,931.697,932.898,"Go ahead, Mary.",15,,
208,0.97,932.898,933.198,Hi.,16,,
209,0.97,933.198,934.433,My name is Jacqueline.,16,,
210,0.97,934.433,935.401,And this is Mary.,16,,
211,0.97,935.401,938.47,And she's going to be signing so I'm going to speak for her.,16,,
212,0.97,938.47,939.505,Wonderful.,17,,
213,0.97,939.505,942.141,Thank you.,17,,
214,0.97,942.141,944.209,Hello.,18,,
215,0.97,944.209,945.644,My name is Mary Lukesy.,18,,
216,0.97,945.644,951.317,Could you pull the microphone a little closer to you?,19,,
217,0.97,951.317,951.583,Sorry.,20,,
218,0.97,951.583,952.518,Hello.,21,,
219,0.97,952.518,955.287,My name is Mary Lukesy.,21,,
220,0.97,955.287,959.058,And I started working for Instacart in 2015.,21,,
221,0.97,959.058,963.862,"At the time, I was working with Deaf-Blind clients, helping with shopping.",21,,
222,0.97,963.862,966.765,It was a nonprofit organization.,21,,
223,0.97,966.765,969.168,And I didn't work full time.,21,,
224,0.97,969.168,972.037,I had difficulty finding jobs.,21,,
225,0.97,972.037,978.277,And I saw an advertisement about working for Instacart and shopping for groceries for customers.,21,,
226,0.97,978.277,982.981,It seemed like something I could do to make extra income.,21,,
227,0.97,982.981,988.887,I believe grocery shopping for customers is a great industry.,21,,
228,0.97,988.887,996.161,There's a lot of goodness in helping customers get healthy food.,21,,
229,0.97,996.161,1000.833,I also noticed there are a lot of deaf workers on Instacart.,21,,
230,0.97,1000.833,1004.203,The App technology enables them.,21,,
231,0.97,1004.203,1009.174,The gig economy is good because it provides income.,21,,
232,0.97,1009.174,1016.115,Including for deaf individuals who are probably trying to find work.,21,,
233,0.97,1016.115,1022.254,Working for Instacart was a supplemental income source for me.,21,,
234,0.97,1022.254,1029.728,"I worked four-hour shifts in the afternoon, and made about $66 per shift.",21,,
235,0.97,1029.728,1036.835,"But then the average pay decreased, so I wondered, if I work more hours, if I could start earning more.",21,,
236,0.97,1036.835,1042.841,I realized that the Amountin Stacart offered for each batch was random.,21,,
237,0.97,1042.841,1047.946,Sometimes I was asked to go a long way to deliver a batch that didn't pay very well.,21,,
238,0.97,1047.946,1051.75,So I tried to choose which batches had good pay or not.,21,,
239,0.97,1051.75,1055.921,But I had difficulty in deciding which batches were good pay.,21,,
240,0.97,1055.921,1059.191,I was driving between 30 and 50 miles per shift.,21,,
241,0.97,1059.191,1064.029,"And as gig workers, we have to cover all of those expenses for our cars.",21,,
242,0.97,1064.029,1068.7,All the miles meant I needed more body repairs and my tires wear out faster.,21,,
243,0.97,1068.7,1073.005,I also got into an accident in the early days of driving for Instacart.,21,,
244,0.97,1073.005,1076.041,And I had to be careful while Multitasking.,21,,
245,0.97,1076.041,1078.477,I decided I didn't like what Instacart has been doing.,21,,
246,0.97,1078.477,1084.85,"It seems that they're playing with me, trying to trick me into accepting batches.",21,,
247,0.97,1084.85,1089.321,"For me, I was able to get more hours at my other job and lean it towards more.",21,,
248,0.97,1089.321,1093.425,But I see other shoppers who are still struggling financially.,21,,
249,0.97,1093.425,1098.03,"I'm here because I think we should get fair pay, real pay, decent pay.",21,,
250,0.97,1098.03,1100.866,"We are working to pay groceries, rent and bills.",21,,
251,0.97,1100.866,1104.87,We need minimum wage with tips on top and Tranparency for companies.,21,,
252,0.97,1104.87,1105.671,Thank you for listening.,21,,
253,0.97,1105.671,1106.105,I appreciate it.,21,,
254,0.97,1106.105,1111.91,I hope the city council will make improvements to improve gig workers pay.,21,,
255,0.97,1111.91,1112.277,Thank you.,22,,
256,0.97,1112.277,1114.379,Thank you very much.,23,,
257,0.97,1114.379,1114.746,Mary.,24,,
258,0.97,1114.746,1115.28,Sorry.,24,,
259,0.97,1115.28,1115.647,That was Mary.,24,,
260,0.97,1115.647,1125.757,Lee?,24,,
261,0.97,1127.392,1132.264,My name is Leif Gerring.,25,,
262,0.97,1132.264,1135.801,I worked in the gig economy from 2017 to the end of 2018.,25,,
263,0.97,1135.801,1141.807,"I worked for a handful of Apps, including Uber and Lyft.",25,,
264,0.97,1141.807,1146.044,"Personal right now, Uber eats and Dolly.",25,,
265,0.97,1146.044,1152.818,I got into the gig business because I needed a flexible schedule as a young adult and a student.,25,,
266,0.97,1152.818,1156.555,"And for a while, it worked.",25,,
267,0.97,1156.555,1190.889,"But Unfortunately, especially in the courier services, like Uber eats, it--I realized before very long that the entire point is--is kind of self-defeating because on a typical delivery, I might drive 10 miles total round trip, get paid $4.50, and then my--and even in the modest economy car value with driving, I might spend half of that on gas.",25,,
268,0.97,1190.889,1198.997,"And in addition to that, tips and other wages aren't really shown.",25,,
269,0.97,1198.997,1207.906,There's speculation that tips aren't even being completely diverted to the drivers.,25,,
270,0.97,1207.906,1223.188,"And we need to have App Tranparency, in terms of how much we're getting paid in addition to receiving more pay so that our work isn't ultimately meaningless.",25,,
271,0.97,1223.188,1248.113,"It wasn't even unheard of, where I would have a net gain of zero because a delivery might include, and I'm not exaggerating, 20, 25 miles of driving but because they only pay you based on the distance between the restaurant and the customer, even if most of the driving was between your starting location and the restaurant, it ends up being nothing.",25,,
272,0.97,1248.113,1249.047,Thank you.,25,,
273,0.97,1249.047,1250.315,Thank you very much.,26,,
274,0.97,1250.315,1252.417,Thank you for sharing your story.,26,,
275,0.97,1252.417,1261.627,"If it's okay with the rest of the folks who are here, if you can stay a little bit, we'll get to the rest of the public comment on Orca for all in about a half an hour.",27,,
276,0.97,1261.627,1262.861,If that's okay.,27,,
277,0.97,1262.861,1267.599,"If there's anybody who needs to leave, please raise your hand right now.",27,,
278,0.97,1267.599,1267.799,Okay.,27,,
279,0.97,1267.799,1272.938,Go ahead and come on up.,27,,
280,0.97,1272.938,1276.642,And please state your name for the record.,27,,
281,0.97,1276.642,1277.509,Yes.,28,,
282,0.97,1277.509,1278.71,Mary Kylie Cranford.,28,,
283,0.97,1278.71,1282.214,I'm here--I'm a D6 constituent.,28,,
284,0.97,1282.214,1284.483,O I'm here to speak about Orca for all.,28,,
285,0.97,1284.483,1289.388,"I moved to Seattle less than three years ago, and got a minimum wage job, which was wonderful.",28,,
286,0.97,1289.388,1291.79,I was so happy I got one so quickly.,28,,
287,0.97,1291.79,1293.959,Didn't realize I had to take the bulls every day.,28,,
288,0.97,1293.959,1306.271,"And from a state that doesn't have as good of transportation, immediately calculating $100 a month from maze paycheck made me worried.",28,,
289,0.97,1306.271,1312.044,"The contractor I worked for, who was a contractor through Amazon did offer that benefit.",28,,
290,0.97,1312.044,1314.713,I later worked for commuter benefits for Amazon.,28,,
291,0.97,1314.713,1318.85,I was helping other employees get their Orca cards and they thinks they needed.,28,,
292,0.97,1318.85,1328.56,"But just looking at that location, there is a lot of discrepancy in between contracted employees, and a lot of those employers are big Companyless.",28,,
293,0.97,1328.56,1338.136,"So while Amazon may give their corporate employees Orca for all benefits, a lot of people that are working there may not be getting them.",28,,
294,0.97,1338.136,1340.706,And those are the people that often need it the most.,28,,
295,0.97,1340.706,1351.349,So I would really encourage you guys to look at this bill and this resolution so that we can have this equity across al of the people working here in Seattle.,28,,
296,0.97,1351.349,1356.254,It really makes a huge difference for a lot of people that are working side by side.,28,,
297,0.97,1356.254,1360.525,"Taking the same commutes, do the same--spending that same money.",28,,
298,0.97,1360.525,1364.963,But it would mean so much more for a lot of the people that aren't currently getting that benefit.,28,,
299,0.97,1364.963,1366.164,So thank you for the time.,28,,
300,0.97,1366.164,1368.734,And thank you for letting me speak now.,28,,
301,0.97,1368.734,1372.304,I'm going to have you put your name on this sheet if you could help out.,29,,
302,0.97,1372.304,1377.275,And we will keep public comment open for just a moment.,29,,
303,0.97,1377.275,1380.779,Thank you for bearing with me.,29,,
304,0.97,1380.779,1383.215,We have a heard deadline.,29,,
305,0.97,1383.215,1387.119,We are going to keep these first three appointments and keep public comment open.,29,,
306,0.97,1387.119,1390.989,If we can have our first item on the agenda read.,29,,
307,0.97,1390.989,1398.497,"If we could be joined by Jeff Davis, the executive director for Surfs and Judith Blinder.",29,,
308,0.97,1398.497,1404.97,The appointee for consideration.,29,,
309,0.97,1404.97,1410.976,Agenda item 1. appointment of Judith Blinder as member for a briefing and possible vote.,30,,
310,0.97,1410.976,1411.51,Wonderful.,31,,
311,0.97,1411.51,1411.777,Welcome.,31,,
312,0.97,1411.777,1417.282,"So Jeff, thank you very much, I should say, executive director Davis, thank you for joining us at the table.",31,,
313,0.97,1417.282,1418.416,We're really excited to have you.,31,,
314,0.97,1418.416,1429.594,"And we know that the Seattle city employees retirement system, board of administration is sort of a unique board, and that some of the positions are Self-Appointing.",31,,
315,0.97,1429.594,1439.905,Can you talk a little about the unique situation we find ourselves in with some folks having Transitioned off in the temporary nature of this and the makeup of the board and what you have been up to lately.,31,,
316,0.97,1439.905,1443.675,"And then, Ms. Blinder, we're going to ask you to talk a little bit about yourself, the work you've done.",31,,
317,0.97,1443.675,1445.31,We have your Packeted with us.,31,,
318,0.97,1445.31,1448.113,We know of your comprehensive work and your resume.,31,,
319,0.97,1448.113,1452.751,We would love to more more of what your Interestsor the board.,31,,
320,0.97,1452.751,1458.023,The Rowtirement system is governed by a Seven-Member board.,32,,
321,0.97,1458.023,1460.559,The municipal board spells out the membership of that board.,32,,
322,0.97,1460.559,1463.662,And three of the positions are elected by members.,32,,
323,0.97,1463.662,1470.502,Two of those board member positions are active employees.,32,,
324,0.97,1470.502,1475.974,"Last summer, we had an election for one of those active city employee members.",32,,
325,0.97,1475.974,1479.144,And the membership voted on a new board member.,32,,
326,0.97,1479.144,1485.15,"That board member served for a number of months, but then left at the end of the year.",32,,
327,0.97,1485.15,1492.891,The municipal code actually spells out what should happen when that circumstance happens.,32,,
328,0.97,1492.891,1503.001,"And until the retirement system holds another election, which we will this coming summer, city council APPOINTS an interim board member.",32,,
329,0.97,1503.001,1508.406,So we are here today to talk about that.,32,,
330,0.97,1508.406,1518.483,The municipal code also spells out that the interim member has to be from the same Department that employed the previous board member.,32,,
331,0.97,1518.483,1526.825,"So another fortunate circumstance, last summer, all three nominees, all three candidates were from Seattle city light.",32,,
332,0.97,1526.825,1530.795,"Judith Blender, who is with us here today, was the second- place finisher.",32,,
333,0.97,1530.795,1540.338,"So we are putting forward her name for consideration for Council to appoint on an interim basis, until we hold elections next summer.",32,,
334,0.97,1540.338,1541.439,What luck.,33,,
335,0.97,1541.439,1543.441,That's great.,33,,
336,0.97,1543.441,1544.142,Thank you.,33,,
337,0.97,1544.142,1545.11,"Hi, Judith.",33,,
338,0.97,1545.11,1545.443,Welcome.,33,,
339,0.97,1545.443,1545.777,Thanks.,34,,
340,0.97,1545.777,1547.379,So why am I interested in doing this?,34,,
341,0.97,1547.379,1548.58,Let me look at my notes.,34,,
342,0.97,1548.58,1549.514,No be from.,35,,
343,0.97,1549.514,1552.584,I don't do a lot of public speaking.,36,,
344,0.97,1552.584,1555.42,This is to help me get through without panic.,36,,
345,0.97,1555.42,1556.454,We're excited.,37,,
346,0.97,1556.454,1560.258,Just pull your microphone a little closer.,37,,
347,0.97,1560.258,1561.493,I'm soft spoken.,38,,
348,0.97,1561.493,1569.401,"Since you have my resume, it does a pretty good job of summing up my work experience and background.",38,,
349,0.97,1569.401,1571.369,But for those who haven't read it.,38,,
350,0.97,1571.369,1576.374,"Basically, I guess I could just summarize by saying I've worked in finance for many, many years.",38,,
351,0.97,1576.374,1583.248,I started out at first Interstate Bank of Washington when first Interstate Bank of Washington existed.,38,,
352,0.97,1583.248,1593.992,"And when it went out Ofexistence, I travel transferred over Toible Kibble investments in their investment Department.",38,,
353,0.97,1593.992,1597.796,And thought it would be good to pursue a CFA.,38,,
354,0.97,1597.796,1600.365,So I am a chartered financial analyst.,38,,
355,0.97,1600.365,1608.506,And I did work that is very similar to what the retirement board of administration does.,38,,
356,0.97,1608.506,1613.211,"I reviewed performance, fund performance.",38,,
357,0.97,1613.211,1615.914,I made selections of fund managers.,38,,
358,0.97,1615.914,1624.255,I used air variety of software to analyze and screen who I thought would be the best choice.,38,,
359,0.97,1624.255,1634.933,"I helped draft policies, investment policy statements for clients to best match their needs, many which were retirement plans, actually.",38,,
360,0.97,1634.933,1639.704,"Made educational presentation--didn't make them, the advisers that I was the analyst for made them.",38,,
361,0.97,1639.704,1650.415,"But I helped draft and did the analysis for, presentations to employees to show them what their benefits would be.",38,,
362,0.97,1650.415,1655.253,And what their returns would be from the fun choices that they've made and so forth.,38,,
363,0.97,1655.253,1658.089,So there's a lot of Commonality there.,38,,
364,0.97,1658.089,1659.624,And I'm interested in this kind of work.,38,,
365,0.97,1659.624,1663.061,"Working at City light, where I've been for quite a long time.",38,,
366,0.97,1663.061,1668.9,"I mainly work in forecasting, financial analysis and rate design.",38,,
367,0.97,1668.9,1671.036,I'm very involved in the rate process.,38,,
368,0.97,1671.036,1673.338,That's much of what I do.,38,,
369,0.97,1673.338,1675.206,So it's a little different.,38,,
370,0.97,1675.206,1678.209,It's more like doing corporate finance.,38,,
371,0.97,1678.209,1680.945,But I still have a strong interest in investments.,38,,
372,0.97,1680.945,1683.448,And that's what led me to apply for this.,38,,
373,0.97,1683.448,1686.451,I also really like being part of team efforts.,38,,
374,0.97,1686.451,1691.99,"I wanted to mention a little bit, my voluntary experience.",38,,
375,0.97,1691.99,1699.597,I served on the board of--what's the word?,38,,
376,0.97,1699.597,1709.741,Funds established by a charitable bequest of the Audubon society that was mainly vested in fix income.,38,,
377,0.97,1709.741,1712.477,"Actually, we expanded it and I was part of that policy decision.",38,,
378,0.97,1712.477,1717.615,But the person who made the bequest was very conservative and loved birds.,38,,
379,0.97,1717.615,1722.153,"So basically, that fund was used to acquire mainly wetlands.",38,,
380,0.97,1722.153,1722.454,So anyway.,38,,
381,0.97,1722.454,1723.354,That bit of background.,38,,
382,0.97,1723.354,1728.326,And I've served on a variety of other boards of various organizations I won't name.,38,,
383,0.97,1728.326,1730.895,"But just, you know, I enjoy team work.",38,,
384,0.97,1730.895,1732.33,I enjoy serving on boards.,38,,

404,0.97,1780.345,1781.546,Yeah.,47,,
405,0.97,1781.546,1790.388,"As it relates to fiduciary responsibility, I think that's an area of evolving thinking.",48,,
406,0.97,1790.388,1812.31,And we'd just love to hear a little bit about your thoughts around fiduciary responsibility as it relates specifically to the fact that people are moving away from Investmentless in--or moving away from use of fossil fuels.,48,,
407,0.97,1812.31,1822.754,"And that has an impact on the, sort of the bottom line of portfolios that include fossil fuel investments.",48,,

411,0.97,1834.465,1840.104,I'm also well aware of our need to abide by our fiduciary responsibilities.,49,,
412,0.97,1840.104,1856.955,"So it has to be done in a way that isn't at odds with giving our right retirees present and future, a fair return on their investments.",49,,
413,0.97,1856.955,1858.856,So--I think there's a balance to be struck.,49,,
414,0.97,1858.856,1863.828,"And if we can do it in a way that is responsible, then yes.",49,,
415,0.97,1863.828,1875.273,And I would broaden that a little bit and say that I think it's great that the board has Esg standard.,49,,

550,0.97,2330.594,2336.467,"But otherwise, we will definitely bring this in front of the full Council on Monday February 10th.",80,,
551,0.97,2336.467,2341.205,"What we'll have to do, Councilmembers, due to the meeting occurring after noon on Thursday.",80,,
552,0.97,2341.205,2345.142,I'm going to be proposing that we suspend the rules.,80,,
553,0.97,2345.142,2351.349,We just ask that we be allowed to refer this versus needing to wait another week.,80,,
554,0.97,2351.349,2352.416,Any objection to that?,80,,
555,0.97,2352.416,2353.984,None.,81,,
556,0.97,2353.984,2354.952,Seeing none.,82,,
557,0.97,2354.952,2361.525,Council rules referring to the legislation--I'm sorry.,82,,
558,0.97,2361.525,2369.967,The Council rule considered at a meeting after noon will be Suss Pended so that we can allow this appointment to be considered on Monday February 10th.,82,,
559,0.97,2369.967,2370.267,Wonderful.,82,,
560,0.97,2370.267,2371.068,Sounds like there's no objection.,82,,
561,0.97,2371.068,2375.272,"We'll see you in the audience, or we'll just send you the good news via E-mail.",82,,
562,0.97,2375.272,2377.108,And looking forward to having you on the committee.,82,,
563,0.97,2377.108,2377.575,Thank you.,83,,
564,0.97,2377.575,2381.445,"Thank you, interim director.",84,,
565,0.97,2381.445,2382.046,Wonderful.,85,,
566,0.97,2382.046,2385.75,"Fideta, if you could read into the record item 4. and that would be great.",85,,
567,0.97,2385.75,2387.284,And as we are doing so.,85,,
568,0.97,2387.284,2390.721,"Thank you for joining us, Dan Eder from central staff.",85,,
569,0.97,2390.721,2391.756,And anybody else?,85,,
570,0.97,2391.756,2391.989,Hello.,85,,
571,0.97,2391.989,2396.06,We have not seen you yet this year.,85,,
572,0.97,2396.06,2396.594,Welcome director noble.,85,,
573,0.97,2396.594,2399.096,And I'm not sure if I know your name.,85,,
574,0.97,2399.096,2399.363,Welcome.,85,,
575,0.97,2399.363,2401.432,I want to have you guys introduce yourself.,85,,
576,0.97,2401.432,2403.467,And we will go from there.,85,,
577,0.97,2403.467,2405.703,Agenda item number 4.,86,,
578,0.97,2405.703,2409.774,Capital projects--capital project watch list for briefing and discussion.,86,,
579,0.97,2409.774,2411.542,And you must be Caleb.,87,,
580,0.97,2411.542,2412.409,Is that correct?,87,,
581,0.97,2412.409,2412.743,Yes.,88,,
582,0.97,2412.743,2416.414,Let's start with you.,89,,
583,0.97,2416.414,2418.516,Caleb Waggoner city budget office.,90,,
584,0.97,2418.516,2421.852,Ben noble city budget office.,91,,
585,0.97,2421.852,2423.621,"Dan Eder, central staff.",92,,
586,0.97,2423.621,2424.021,Hello.,93,,
587,0.97,2424.021,2424.321,Thank you.,93,,
588,0.97,2424.321,2427.458,This is a conversation that could go deep into the weeds.,93,,
589,0.97,2427.458,2439.069,"But I really appreciate central staff and Directornoble, your notes that help us stay on the importance of looking at certain projects that need maybe a little additional oversight.",93,,
590,0.97,2439.069,2450.848,"Thank you to Councilmember Herbold for her work the last few years to make sure we have additional opportunities to provide evaluation, input and public Tranparency, especially on some large capital projects.",93,,
591,0.97,2450.848,2458.088,This is about us being good stewards of the city's public funds on these projects.,93,,
592,0.97,2458.088,2460.057,I'd love to have Dan walk us through the memo.,93,,
593,0.97,2460.057,2463.294,I think all of our Council should have received copies.,93,,
594,0.97,2463.294,2465.796,"If not, we can get copies for you.",93,,
595,0.97,2465.796,2468.465,"And director noble, perhaps we can turn it over to you and Caleb.",93,,
596,0.97,2468.465,2470.868,"Be happy to do that, Councilmember.",94,,
597,0.97,2470.868,2476.941,This item on your agenda concerns a resolution that is up for discussion only at this point.,94,,
598,0.97,2476.941,2481.579,Because it hasn't been through the formal introduction referral process.,94,,
599,0.97,2481.579,2484.248,My understanding is that is Cued up for this coming Monday.,94,,
600,0.97,2484.248,2488.452,So it will come back to this Committee for action in the future.,94,,
601,0.97,2488.452,2496.293,"In brief, the resolution would establish an annual watch list of selected capital projects.",94,,
602,0.97,2496.293,2520.784,"For each of the projects that end up on the final version of the 2020 watch list, the executive will provide enhanced reports on a quarterly basis, providing information about the project's scope, schedule and budget and identify how things are going for those complex projects.",94,,
603,0.97,2520.784,2532.029,"Generally speaking, I'm sorry, I should say, the proposed watch list is included in both the resolution and the staff report, labeled as table number 1. and I have put it up on the screen.",94,,
604,0.97,2532.029,2538.569,The overall goal of the watch list is for Council to get regular updates about these projects.,94,,
605,0.97,2538.569,2552.65,And have Forward-Looking information about the potential risks and the mitigation strategies that are envisioned addressing these risks before problems occur.,94,,
606,0.97,2552.65,2562.359,"Terms of just very Briefbackground, in 2018, the Council worked Cooperatively on resolution 31853.",94,,
607,0.97,2562.359,2569.166,That established a process for determining which project goes on a Watchlist and what happens when the projects go on a watch list.,94,,
608,0.97,2569.166,2587.284,"In terms of the process, the executive at the beginning of the year, by January 15th, will propose a list of items that meet whatever criteria the executive uses to come up with its proposal.",94,,
609,0.97,2587.284,2589.753,The Council will review that proposal.,94,,
610,0.97,2589.753,2595.292,"And I should say that the executive did, indeed by January 15th this year, give us their proposal.",94,,
611,0.97,2595.292,2598.662,And that's what this list is comprised of.,94,,
612,0.97,2598.662,2604.935,The process calls for the Council to review that and make a determination by resolution of a final list.,94,,
613,0.97,2604.935,2608.606,And that can certainly be exactly the list that is on your screen.,94,,
614,0.97,2608.606,2614.979,Or you can decide you may want to add projects to that list or otherwise change the list.,94,,
615,0.97,2614.979,2625.723,"And then through the year, each quarter, you'll get information that is in the form of a report that is attached to the staff report.",94,,
616,0.97,2625.723,2631.428,And that was also Anattachment to resolution 31853.,94,,
617,0.97,2631.428,2637.501,"You will also, for projects that are not on the watch list, you will also get information quarterly.",94,,
618,0.97,2637.501,2646.443,"But it will be at a higher summary level, providing information about the lifetime budget for the capital project.",94,,
619,0.97,2646.443,2650.28,And how life data is actually measuring up against that lifetime budget.,94,,
620,0.97,2650.28,2653.817,And you'll also have information.,94,,
621,0.97,2653.817,2656.253,Similar summary level information about schedule status.,94,,
622,0.97,2656.253,2686.216,"I want to point out that there are a couple of projects that were included in the 2019 list that were not carried forward onto the 2020 list that was not done as a purposeful decision, and in fact, after discussion between central staff and CBO staff, we are both in agreement that those projects should be added to this list.",94,,
623,0.97,2686.216,2686.984,It's obviously your decision.,94,,
624,0.97,2686.984,2691.288,But it would be a joint staff recommendation that they be added.,94,,
625,0.97,2691.288,2695.025,The projects are the Lake center community project.,94,,
626,0.97,2695.025,2700.931,"And the center city Gateway, intelligent Informations project and S-Dot.",94,,
627,0.97,2700.931,2704.401,"With Tha, I will turn it over to CBO.",94,,
628,0.97,2704.401,2710.007,If you all wanted to have anything you wanted to add.,94,,
629,0.97,2710.007,2714.445,Before you do that.,95,,
630,0.97,2714.445,2720.317,Councilmember Herbold and any other comments before we get into this sort of presentation on the background?,95,,
631,0.97,2720.317,2720.818,Thank you.,96,,
632,0.97,2720.818,2724.154,"Actually, I do have a couple of questions.",96,,
633,0.97,2724.154,2739.837,I remember in previous meetings we had discussed that the watch list does not need to be only comprised of distinct capital projects but could also include programmatic projects.,96,,
634,0.97,2739.837,2742.84,"For instance, the asphalt Repaving program.",96,,
635,0.97,2742.84,2748.712,Or any number of sort of programmatic projects within the C.I.P.,96,,
636,0.97,2748.712,2756.353,Does the review of the Watchlist for 2020 include the potential for those kind of programmatic projects as well?,96,,
637,0.97,2756.353,2761.725,I think you're right for sure that any project in the C.I.P.,97,,
638,0.97,2761.725,2763.894,Is eligible to be put on the Watchlist.,97,,
639,0.97,2763.894,2771.702,"I will say that the format of the report seems, most of the sections lend themselves to a discreet project.",97,,
640,0.97,2771.702,2774.771,A project that has a beginning and an end.,97,,
641,0.97,2774.771,2780.077,"And therefore has a--you know, a finite lifetime budget.",97,,
642,0.97,2780.077,2782.813,And accomplishment schedule.,97,,
643,0.97,2782.813,2786.95,"That said, the executive this time around on this proposed list.",97,,
644,0.97,2786.95,2791.255,Let's see where it is.,97,,
645,0.97,2791.255,2801.698,Number 4. the Seattle city of light pole replacements project is a result of programmatic because of issues that arose in the last year or so.,97,,
646,0.97,2801.698,2806.47,The executive has proposed added to this year's watch list.,97,,
647,0.97,2806.47,2808.872,So we can get quarterly reports on it.,97,,
648,0.97,2808.872,2811.608,"As you've mentioned, this is a programmatic project.",97,,
649,0.97,2811.608,2825.255,"And given the fact that some programmatic projects are derived from finite funding sources, be our property tax levies.",98,,
650,0.97,2825.255,2832.696,Úthey might in some ways still lend themselves to the same or similar review as we do for capital projects.,98,,
651,0.97,2832.696,2841.538,Because we might not ever stop Repaving asphalt.,98,,
652,0.97,2841.538,2850.414,But we have a six-year funding window because of a Particularlevy.,98,,
653,0.97,2850.414,2850.681,Yeah.,99,,
654,0.97,2850.681,2851.715,Ben if you want to answer.,99,,
655,0.97,2851.715,2856.453,"I was just going to say, this is one of the oversight tools that is at your disposal.",99,,
656,0.97,2856.453,2860.19,It is certainly not the only tool.,99,,
657,0.97,2860.19,2865.729,And the--I think it's called the move Seattle levy oversight at this point.,99,,
658,0.97,2865.729,2871.335,Gets regular updates from S-Dot and provides periodic feedback to the Council.,99,,
659,0.97,2871.335,2874.438,So that's another way that you would get that kind of information.,99,,
660,0.97,2874.438,2879.376,"I would just like to say, we will report in whatever detail you want.",100,,
661,0.97,2879.376,2882.045,And I mean that very sincerely.,100,,
662,0.97,2882.045,2889.953,"I mean, as Dan has pointed out, the pole replacement project is here because of the attention around pole replacement at this point.",100,,
663,0.97,2889.953,2896.36,And we are debating whether or not next year that might be a separate project.,100,,
664,0.97,2896.36,2899.496,With respect to paving as an example.,100,,
665,0.97,2899.496,2903.8,"To give you in a sense, there are examples in the parks Department about trail maintenance.",100,,
666,0.97,2903.8,2906.77,And the like.,100,,
667,0.97,2906.77,2909.506,"Not unusual, typical of those things.",100,,
668,0.97,2909.506,2913.61,It's that they're multiple funding sources flowing in.,100,,
669,0.97,2913.61,2916.28,Doesn't make them Unright if you will for reviewing.,100,,
670,0.97,2916.28,2917.914,But just echo what Dan said.,100,,
671,0.97,2917.914,2920.417,This is really all about accountability.,100,,
672,0.97,2920.417,2924.988,"Which is why I'm here to say, we will deliver whatever you need.",100,,
673,0.97,2924.988,2929.192,"There is, with respect to Seattle, there is a separate set of reporting about that.",100,,
674,0.97,2929.192,2933.497,"But if you want the overall picture, happy to provide it.",100,,
675,0.97,2933.497,2933.997,Another thing --,100,,
676,0.97,2933.997,2941.171,"My question is just simply whether or not we looked at program attic projects, and did this same sort of risk screen?",101,,
677,0.97,2941.171,2941.605,We have.,102,,
678,0.97,2941.605,2946.009,Which is why the Poleless are there.,102,,
679,0.97,2946.009,2949.746,But our criteria and yours might not be the same.,102,,
680,0.97,2949.746,2955.619,I'm not advocating for any being particular program Atticelement to be added.,103,,
681,0.97,2955.619,2958.455,And I'm not trying to be defensive.,104,,
682,0.97,2958.455,2958.889,Point well taken.,104,,
683,0.97,2958.889,2960.123,"And Yeah, we did.",104,,
684,0.97,2960.123,2960.39,Okay.,105,,
685,0.97,2960.39,2977.174,"And my other question is, just how are we finding the--the adequacy of the reports from central staff's perspective at really identifying risk?",105,,
686,0.97,2977.174,2993.056,"And the ability for not just central staff and the executive but also policy makers to not just anticipate or see risk when it is evident, but also to respond to it when it becomes evident.",105,,
687,0.97,2993.056,2996.593,"When something moves from, for instance, from green to yellow.",105,,
688,0.97,2996.593,3007.404,"You know, we, as you know, there are central staff analysts who are assigned to staff the Council on individual departments.",106,,
689,0.97,3007.404,3011.174,I don't pretend to be one with all of the information.,106,,
690,0.97,3011.174,3029.192,"But what I've heard from the analysts who are working with the departments, and what I have observed in terms of interactions with Councilmembers when the information comes to this floor, is that it is a useful starting place for conversations.",106,,
691,0.97,3029.192,3033.63,It is not an encyclopedic dump of information.,106,,
692,0.97,3033.63,3037.634,But it does provide very useful information.,106,,
693,0.97,3037.634,3044.107,And a Check-In on projects that sunlight is a good thing.,106,,
694,0.97,3044.107,3045.008,Thank you.,107,,
695,0.97,3045.008,3046.743,I would echo the same.,108,,
696,0.97,3046.743,3055.852,And I'm glad to hear it in the sense that--reports aren't designed as much to answer the questions as to have you and us want to pose more.,108,,
697,0.97,3055.852,3063.527,And it creates an affirmative obligation on the part of the departments to inform us both.,108,,
698,0.97,3063.527,3070.967,In places where there are issues or whether they're anticipating there could be issues that gives us both a chance to then follow up.,108,,
699,0.97,3070.967,3075.138,"And almost invariably, it's follow-up that is required.",108,,
700,0.97,3075.138,3082.946,But those aren't questions that would have been asked without the information in the report.,108,,
701,0.97,3082.946,3085.282,"And director, Dan, Caleb.",109,,
702,0.97,3085.282,3087.35,I have to leave you all.,109,,
703,0.97,3087.35,3089.119,I have to leave at 3:00.,109,,
704,0.97,3089.119,3090.787,It is now 3:00.,109,,
705,0.97,3090.787,3097.26,"I do have one question regarding the memo from you, director noble.",109,,
706,0.97,3097.26,3099.096,"Had 6--17, Yeah.",109,,
707,0.97,3099.096,3101.998,17 items and the memo from Mr.,109,,
708,0.97,3101.998,3102.866,Eder included 14 items.,109,,
709,0.97,3102.866,3109.506,And that is due to the recommendations that a few of the projects be removed from the watch list.,109,,
710,0.97,3109.506,3113.477,One of those projects is a Smith Cove park development.,109,,
711,0.97,3113.477,3123.52,And I raise concerns with it being removed from the watch list as it has not been completed for the park.,109,,
712,0.97,3123.52,3129.993,I submit for the record this photograph from the times with Council member Sally Bagshaw.,109,,
713,0.97,3129.993,3135.432,"I would like to reflect in this note, we have Mayor Mcginn.",109,,
714,0.97,3135.432,3138.201,We have Gail Talenton.,109,,
715,0.97,3138.201,3141.738,Larry Phillips as County Councilmember.,109,,
716,0.97,3141.738,3143.507,All celebrating the opening of the park.,109,,
717,0.97,3143.507,3151.014,"And yet, it--we have not broken ground.",109,,
718,0.97,3151.014,3164.161,So this RAISES concerns for me for it to be removed from the less I know there were concerns regarding King County Metro waste waters.,109,,
719,0.97,3164.161,3169.065,Tunnels and types to the waist treatment plan.,109,,
720,0.97,3169.065,3173.069,And I understand that there are reasonable variables that delayed this project.,109,,
721,0.97,3173.069,3183.38,I just do not feel that it should be removed from the less since it has not broken ground.,109,,
722,0.97,3183.38,3186.182,Happy to include it.,109,,
723,0.97,3186.182,3188.084,It's relatively uncomplicated.,109,,
724,0.97,3188.084,3191.321,It wasn't a complex one with risk.,109,,
725,0.97,3191.321,3195.992,"But again, we are happy to include it and understand that it has been slow in delivery.",109,,
726,0.97,3195.992,3202.065,And keeping on the Watchlist RAISES--if it helps create some pressure to deliver.,109,,
727,0.97,3202.065,3205.068,And I could see from your perspective that it could.,109,,
728,0.97,3205.068,3207.304,That makes all the sense in the world.,109,,
729,0.97,3207.304,3208.204,Thank you so much.,110,,
730,0.97,3208.204,3209.573,I fully support that as well.,111,,
731,0.97,3209.573,3211.441,Thank you for bringing that historic record.,111,,
732,0.97,3211.441,3212.375,That document.,111,,
733,0.97,3212.375,3223.219,"It would be really helpful when it gets complete for us, to have a similar photo Soshow the completion and the time frame.",111,,
734,0.97,3223.219,3232.896,I also will like to hear where we stand on the stage of the use of the funds that were originally allocated for 35th street.,111,,
735,0.97,3232.896,3233.63,And creating safe bike lanes.,111,,
736,0.97,3233.63,3240.937,"I don't know if this has already been brought up with you or central staff, Dan, if you have had a chance to look into this.",111,,
737,0.97,3240.937,3254.117,"But prior to bringing this back before Committee's consideration, it will would be helpful for me to know what stage we're at, given that the protected bike Lane on 35th was opted out of.",111,,
738,0.97,3254.117,3256.453,And how much money we have remaining in that effort.,111,,
739,0.97,3256.453,3260.79,And looking forward to working with the Council members on that as well.,111,,
740,0.97,3260.79,3261.257,Councilmember Lewis.,111,,
741,0.97,3261.257,3262.525,Did you have a comment?,111,,
742,0.97,3262.525,3263.593,No questions.,112,,
743,0.97,3263.593,3263.96,Wonderful.,113,,
744,0.97,3263.96,3265.629,"I have to thank you, chair.",114,,
745,0.97,3265.629,3271.968,I have to be excused.,114,,
746,0.97,3271.968,3280.644,I want to signal my support for the Orca for all proposals as it is needed to navigate our city.,114,,
747,0.97,3280.644,3287.651,We will resume our committee meetings on our usual time so you can be there for the full time very soon.,115,,
748,0.97,3287.651,3289.286,Sorry for the extra time.,116,,
749,0.97,3289.286,3292.222,I thought it was important to tack on to that as well.,116,,
750,0.97,3292.222,3292.689,Please continue.,116,,
751,0.97,3292.689,3297.527,We'll get back to 35th.,117,,
752,0.97,3297.527,3299.529,Procedurally.,118,,
753,0.97,3299.529,3303.533,Councilmember Strauss just mentioned a memo from the budget office.,118,,
754,0.97,3303.533,3307.671,To you.,118,,
755,0.97,3307.671,3314.311,Recommending projects and not all of them made it onto the less.,118,,
756,0.97,3314.311,3314.711,Is that accurate?,118,,
757,0.97,3314.711,3322.118,The memo includes the list from--it intended to include the less from 2019.,119,,
758,0.97,3322.118,3327.223,And to essentially trace through any projects that were not recommended to remain on the less in 2020.,119,,
759,0.97,3327.223,3343.206,"As I mentioned in my opening comments, there were a couple of projects that were erroneously excluded from the, what was assumed to be the 2019 list, that staff was recommending, in fact, move forward, to the 2020 list.",119,,
760,0.97,3343.206,3353.45,Then there are also a few projects that were on the 2019 list that the executive described why they proposed to remove from the 2020 proposed less.,119,,
761,0.97,3353.45,3354.417,Okay.,120,,
762,0.97,3354.417,3363.526,So this--the memo that Councilmember Strauss was recommending was a January 15th memo to you.,121,,
763,0.97,3363.526,3364.194,That's correct.,122,,
764,0.97,3364.194,3369.666,So that crosswalk that you just verbally described is Replicated here.,123,,
765,0.97,3369.666,3370.133,That is correct.,124,,
766,0.97,3370.133,3373.57,And there was an oversight on two of them.,125,,
767,0.97,3373.57,3375.438,Super.,126,,
768,0.97,3375.438,3376.339,Thank you.,126,,
769,0.97,3376.339,3378.274,Any other comment.,127,,
770,0.97,3378.274,3379.275,Please continue.,128,,
771,0.97,3379.275,3384.247,We wanted to remain consistent with the cooperative effort that started this a couple of years ago.,129,,
772,0.97,3384.247,3388.385,We find this actually useful on our side as well.,129,,
773,0.97,3388.385,3389.219,It's great.,129,,
774,0.97,3389.219,3391.287,"Again, from the responsibility from the departments.",129,,
775,0.97,3391.287,3392.889,S we are all on board.,129,,
776,0.97,3392.889,3397.727,"We do think, you know, a highlighted less to help focus attention is useful.",129,,
777,0.97,3397.727,3398.194,It is.,130,,
778,0.97,3398.194,3400.93,And appreciate being able to work with you on that list.,131,,
779,0.97,3400.93,3403.7,"So our intent, council colleagues.",132,,
780,0.97,3403.7,3404.467,Did Yu have another question?,132,,
781,0.97,3404.467,3405.902,Not a question.,133,,
782,0.97,3405.902,3407.771,But a hope?,133,,
783,0.97,3407.771,3412.909,And for another addition.,133,,
784,0.97,3412.909,3426.99,"The--reviewing the 2020 work plan items for my Committee, public safety and human service Committee, I've asked that central staff review one of the projects on that work plan.",133,,
785,0.97,3426.99,3431.361,And that's that criminal justice information system projects.,133,,
786,0.97,3431.361,3436.466,It is in the C.I.P.,133,,
787,0.97,3436.466,3437.133,"The 2020, 2025C.I.P.",133,,
788,0.97,3437.133,3442.338,"And in that document, it's called Mcis, 2.2 replacement project.",133,,
789,0.97,3442.338,3450.28,"And based on that review, central staff is recommending that we add this project to the watch list.",133,,
790,0.97,3450.28,3457.454,"Because 1, it's--among the risk factors that they use, one of them is the size of the project.",133,,
791,0.97,3457.454,3461.191,"And so in this instance, the price tag is significant.",133,,
792,0.97,3461.191,3462.525,It's $41 million.,133,,
793,0.97,3462.525,3465.762,There is potential for scope Creek.,133,,
794,0.97,3465.762,3466.129,Prior to 2018.,133,,
795,0.97,3466.129,3471.267,"The project was named the municipal court information, system replacement project.",133,,
796,0.97,3471.267,3481.11,"But then was renamed criminal justice, system project in 2018 to more accurately reflect efforts beyond Mcis replacement.",133,,
797,0.97,3481.11,3488.985,The project is showing as yellow on the project status report.,133,,
798,0.97,3488.985,3492.422,And then interbranch coordinator with the court.,133,,
799,0.97,3492.422,3494.924,Adds a level of complexity with the project.,133,,
800,0.97,3494.924,3498.361,And finally this is one of this Council's priorities.,133,,
801,0.97,3498.361,3505.235,"And for these reasons, I would appreciate the opportunity to add it to the Watchlist as well.",133,,
802,0.97,3505.235,3507.537,I happened to be on the steering committees.,134,,
803,0.97,3507.537,3510.507,It is a complex project.,134,,
804,0.97,3510.507,3510.807,With risks.,134,,
805,0.97,3510.807,3514.577,"So in that context, a worthy addition.",134,,
806,0.97,3514.577,3517.213,We had focused on information technology ones.,134,,
807,0.97,3517.213,3519.015,I think we should add this one.,134,,
808,0.97,3519.015,3523.786,Then we should spend a little more--just--and pass this resolution.,134,,
809,0.97,3523.786,3531.828,"And then we, on this side of the table, should spend a little more time, going forward the rest of this year, thinking about how to track I.T.",134,,
810,0.97,3531.828,3532.095,Projects.,134,,
811,0.97,3532.095,3537.0,I'm only thinking that the form at might not really match up in just the right way.,134,,
812,0.97,3537.0,3538.601,The reports.,135,,
813,0.97,3538.601,3538.902,Exactly.,136,,
814,0.97,3538.902,3539.202,But --,137,,
815,0.97,3539.202,3540.536,Makes a lot of sense.,138,,
816,0.97,3540.536,3542.605,But the cost and the risks are there.,139,,
817,0.97,3542.605,3545.508,And it's part of the capital program.,139,,
818,0.97,3545.508,3549.145,"Anyway, you can possible appreciate the I.T.",139,,
819,0.97,3549.145,3550.613,Ones.,139,,
820,0.97,3550.613,3555.318,The accountability and the Transparenciy issues are identical.,139,,
821,0.97,3555.318,3555.652,Wonderful.,140,,
822,0.97,3555.652,3556.753,Anything else?,140,,
823,0.97,3556.753,3557.453,Dan?,140,,
824,0.97,3557.453,3574.137,"I was just going to say that I've heard several potential amendments to the current Iteration of the less, and I'd be happy to work with individual Councilmembers on both those and any others that you might have in mind before you--this is Cued up for action at the next committee meeting.",141,,
825,0.97,3574.137,3576.506,"Thank you, Dan, for that Segue.",142,,
826,0.97,3576.506,3580.677,"Because our next meeting is planned for Wednesday, February 19th.",142,,
827,0.97,3580.677,3582.545,Another special time due to President's day.,142,,
828,0.97,3582.545,3585.748,"Dan, if it's okay with you, I'm going to put a deadline there.",142,,
829,0.97,3585.748,3590.32,And you tell me if this is workable for you.,142,,
830,0.97,3590.32,3592.755,"Ideally, Wednesday close of business next week.",142,,
831,0.97,3592.755,3596.726,"That gives you two full business days, actually three.",142,,
832,0.97,3596.726,3603.7,And hopefully that will give us time to take a look at language and put that into language format.,142,,
833,0.97,3603.7,3604.567,Fine.,143,,
834,0.97,3604.567,3609.439,"If you have additional Yement Meament ideas, please let Dan know.",144,,
835,0.97,3609.439,3614.177,And we'll work with his office to finalize the consideration.,144,,
836,0.97,3614.177,3615.311,Additional Commentoss the C.I.P .?,144,,
837,0.97,3615.311,3618.881,"Again, I think this is a really important element of our budgeting process.",144,,
838,0.97,3618.881,3627.623,"Given some of the historic overruns, especially when we look at some of the Seattle city light projects which I had the Purview of chairing the last two years.",144,,
839,0.97,3627.623,3637.7,It was pretty surprising to see some of those dollar figures remember so I think this is a great way for us to be really transparent with the public about the use.,144,,
840,0.97,3637.7,3641.07,And to use stage budgeting if necessary.,144,,
841,0.97,3641.07,3641.738,Great to see you here.,144,,
842,0.97,3641.738,3643.74,"Good to seize you again, Dan.",144,,
843,0.97,3643.74,3644.974,"Thank you, director noble.",144,,
844,0.97,3644.974,3647.543,Let's go ahead and move back into public comment.,145,,
845,0.97,3647.543,3653.182,Because we have our third item on the agenda that is still yet to be discussed.,145,,
846,0.97,3653.182,3658.988,"And that is the concept of Orca for all, or transit benefits for more workers throughout Seattle.",145,,
847,0.97,3658.988,3668.865,"At this point, I'd like to invite up the next three speakers, which would be Laura Lobernstein.",145,,
848,0.97,3668.865,3669.265,Marietta Hunter.,145,,
849,0.97,3669.265,3671.868,And Marla Vander water.,145,,
850,0.97,3671.868,3675.638,You can correct me in I said that wrong.,145,,
851,0.97,3675.638,3676.005,"Hello, Laura.",145,,
852,0.97,3676.005,3679.175,Good to see you again.,145,,
853,0.97,3679.175,3679.442,Yea.,146,,

855,0.97,3679.642,3682.979,My name is Laura Lobernstein.,147,,
856,0.97,3682.979,3684.213,And a district 7 Renter.,147,,
857,0.97,3684.213,3686.249,And I'm here to support Orca for all.,147,,
858,0.97,3686.249,3692.355,Not just for me but on behalf of all of the wonderful people I organize with.,147,,
859,0.97,3692.355,3694.023,And all volunteer organizing collective.,147,,
860,0.97,3694.023,3701.497,A lot of folks are at home now watching.,147,,
861,0.97,3701.497,3715.078,"Justin has a subsidized Orca cart that literally helped him sell his car in January 2018, living in Capitol Hill Andcommuting to Belleview at the Tim.",147,,
862,0.97,3715.078,3719.282,The employer didn't have a program for it at the time.,147,,
863,0.97,3719.282,3723.653,But said that it was cheaper than a parking space.,147,,
864,0.97,3723.653,3730.226,My health is way better taking the Monorail and light rail than sitting for an hour and a half in traffic.,147,,
865,0.97,3730.226,3734.03,Another person said I moved from Seattle to Redmond.,147,,
866,0.97,3734.03,3735.898,I have since changed job jobs.,147,,
867,0.97,3735.898,3740.269,And my new job gives me an Orca pass.,147,,
868,0.97,3740.269,3743.239,We love taking the bus and train.,147,,
869,0.97,3743.239,3745.108,"Molly says, I had to.",147,,
870,0.97,3745.108,3747.877,So I bought a car for the first time in 18 years.,147,,
871,0.97,3747.877,3749.011,I'm still sad about it.,147,,
872,0.97,3749.011,3754.317,Steve said I bought a new car shortly after getting a new job.,148,,
873,0.97,3754.317,3757.42,But then moved to Capitol Hill and got a pass.,148,,
874,0.97,3757.42,3764.627,"Now my new car has 12,000 miles, which includes Round- trip miles to Los Angeles.",148,,
875,0.97,3764.627,3771.534,And the battery is dead because I never drive anywhere.,148,,
876,0.97,3771.534,3779.408,It is amazing how behavior changes when people get that subsidized pass and feel excited to not waste it and take the bus around the city.,149,,
877,0.97,3779.408,3780.409,Thank you so much.,149,,
878,0.97,3780.409,3781.711,"Thank you, Laura.",150,,

882,0.97,3785.748,3786.048,I'm sorry.,151,,
883,0.97,3786.048,3788.784,Thank you for correcting me.,151,,
884,0.97,3788.784,3791.12,It's all good.,152,,
885,0.97,3791.12,3791.354,Hello.,152,,

887,0.97,3795.791,3797.326,It is a blessed day.,152,,
888,0.97,3797.326,3799.362,I came to support Orca for all as well.,152,,
889,0.97,3799.362,3809.272,"I feel that in the future, though, we should be working towards free transportation for everyone just because I'm coming out of a place for homelessness.",152,,
890,0.97,3809.272,3812.241,"And for me, one of the most difficult things was making sure I could get to work.",152,,
891,0.97,3812.241,3818.648,"I had two jobs and was working volunteer and was still riding around, trying to get transit and things like that.",152,,
892,0.97,3818.648,3821.517,So it's just very hard for me at the time.,152,,
893,0.97,3821.517,3829.625,I am thankful now that I am getting into resources in our community that actually help me get free passes.,152,,
894,0.97,3829.625,3830.726,So I'm thankful for that.,152,,

902,0.97,3847.977,3848.945,My name is Mandy.,154,,
903,0.97,3848.945,3852.181,I am here as a member of transit Union.,154,,
904,0.97,3852.181,3855.618,I am here to speak in favor of Orca for all.,154,,
905,0.97,3855.618,3859.422,"As a first step towards also, free transit for everyone.",154,,
906,0.97,3859.422,3867.463,"It will get people out of their cars, making the streets safer for everyone who walks, bikes and for drivers.",154,,
907,0.97,3867.463,3872.134,It's better for our burning planet.,154,,
908,0.97,3872.134,3885.348,And better for all low-income workers who are forced out of our very expensive city to have reliable transportation everywhere to and from work.,154,,
909,0.97,3885.348,3888.284,And every every place else they need to go.,154,,
910,0.97,3888.284,3889.185,Thank you.,154,,
911,0.97,3889.185,3890.386,Thank you.,155,,
912,0.97,3890.386,3890.653,Jessica.,155,,
913,0.97,3890.653,3897.193,Jessica will be followed by Scott Alespatch.,155,,
914,0.97,3897.193,3897.56,Hi.,156,,
915,0.97,3897.56,3898.995,My name is Jessica.,156,,
916,0.97,3898.995,3904.0,And I work at trader Joe's on Capitol Hill.,156,,
917,0.97,3904.0,3907.169,We do not have a subsidized Orca pass.,156,,
918,0.97,3907.169,3910.74,What we have is a pretax writeoff.,156,,
919,0.97,3910.74,3916.879,And I know that barely anybody uses it because it's quite confusing to figure out.,156,,
920,0.97,3916.879,3926.188,"I have recently had a lot of injuries and so found myself having to take the bus a lot, after using my bike or my legs for most of my transportation.",156,,
921,0.97,3926.188,3934.23,And I found out I was spending at least $175 more per month than what I had been previously.,156,,
922,0.97,3934.23,3937.266,Which was definitely an added expense.,156,,
923,0.97,3937.266,3939.535,I did recently figure out that I could buy a pass.,156,,
924,0.97,3939.535,3941.837,It was about $100 a month.,156,,
925,0.97,3941.837,3944.807,But it definitely is an added expense.,156,,
926,0.97,3944.807,3957.787,"I also am quite surprised by the discrepancy, as far as 85% of people making $100,000 or more receive subsidized transit.",156,,
927,0.97,3957.787,3961.09,"While those of us making $50,000 or less, maybe half of us do.",156,,
928,0.97,3961.09,3965.561,So I definitely find that to be an issue of concern.,156,,
929,0.97,3965.561,3967.43,"Just yesterday, speaking with a Coworker.",156,,
930,0.97,3967.43,3968.331,He has a car.,156,,
931,0.97,3968.331,3971.467,And he told me about deciding between driving a car or taking the buzz.,156,,
932,0.97,3971.467,3977.373,"And he was talking about working out the numbers, which one one was more affordable.",156,,
933,0.97,3977.373,3981.644,"And his opinion, because his car was paid off, that was more affordable.",156,,
934,0.97,3981.644,3982.078,And disappointing.,156,,
935,0.97,3982.078,3983.079,But that's the truth.,156,,
936,0.97,3983.079,3989.819,"But also, even the fact that running the numbers, you have to decide, like which one is closer.",156,,
937,0.97,3989.819,3995.858,I feel that it would be great to make it just completely obvious.,156,,
938,0.97,3995.858,4000.629,That transit is heads above everything else as the least expensive option.,156,,
939,0.97,4000.629,4005.534,"And with climate change, I think it's absolutely necessary that we move in the direction of free transit for all.",156,,
940,0.97,4005.534,4008.337,Thank you very much.,156,,
941,0.97,4008.337,4008.904,Thank you.,157,,

949,0.97,4024.387,4026.522,"Last year, we voted to support it.",161,,
950,0.97,4026.522,4028.524,We believe that mobility is a human right.,161,,
951,0.97,4028.524,4034.83,One that is currently distributed Inequitably.,161,,
952,0.97,4034.83,4039.235,And using public transportation and away from Single-Occupancy vehicle trips.,161,,
953,0.97,4039.235,4045.141,"Personally, having a fully subsidized employer was the reason I began taking a bus to work every day.",161,,
954,0.97,4045.141,4047.276,I live in Capitol Hill and work in Redmond.,161,,
955,0.97,4047.276,4049.211,And in the middle of 2012.,161,,
956,0.97,4049.211,4055.518,"When the tolls went in on the bridge, it cost me $5 to drive to work every day, I said, Oh, I have this transit pass.",161,,
957,0.97,4055.518,4058.954,Maybe I should start using it.,161,,
958,0.97,4058.954,4063.092,So that has brought me a lot of of benefits.,161,,
959,0.97,4063.092,4065.528,I walk through exercise.,161,,
960,0.97,4065.528,4067.263,I can Twitter.,161,,
961,0.97,4067.263,4076.472,"Unfortunately, right now, many lower-income Seattlites don't have the option I did.",161,,
962,0.97,4076.472,4076.872,Because their.,161,,
963,0.97,4076.872,4081.744,Am employers don't provide the subsidized transit pass.,161,,
964,0.97,4081.744,4088.484,"When my wife switched jobs, it was difficult to understand the options and choice.",161,,
965,0.97,4088.484,4096.892,"And Fortunately, it doesn't make sense why a Tech employee like me can ride the transit.",161,,
966,0.97,4096.892,4103.632,I and the 43rd district Democrats urge you Topaz Orca for all legislation.,161,,
967,0.97,4103.632,4109.505,And look at reducing or eliminating transit fares for everyone.,161,,
968,0.97,4109.505,4109.839,Thank you.,162,,
969,0.97,4109.839,4114.21,And we have Bobby and Billy.,163,,

978,0.97,4125.654,4127.623,I can verify that it's pretty epic.,168,,
979,0.97,4127.623,4135.297,"But right now, I'm going to pretend to be Brenna Strop who wrote this statement.",168,,
980,0.97,4135.297,4135.598,Here goes.,168,,

993,0.97,4184.68,4187.149,Driven in part by vehicle emissions.,168,,
994,0.97,4187.149,4192.188,Reducing the number of cars on the road is very much a public health and medical need.,168,,
995,0.97,4192.188,4194.623,More people on buses mean fewer in cars.,168,,
996,0.97,4194.623,4197.293,And fewer cars mean less driving asthma.,168,,
997,0.97,4197.293,4203.299,Global warming and the many ill health effects therefore--thereof.,168,,
998,0.97,4203.299,4206.535,Even public health is not a concern for you.,168,,
999,0.97,4206.535,4209.838,As it is for the members of Uha.,168,,
1000,0.97,4209.838,4217.212,Leaders in the city have a responsibility to remove all barriers to public transportation to achieve the goal we all share.,168,,
1001,0.97,4217.212,4223.285,Reducing the number of drivers on our road and making transit accessible to all those in need.,168,,
1002,0.97,4223.285,4230.292,And the most stubborn barrier remaining is the cost of transit on citizens.,168,,
1003,0.97,4230.292,4237.6,Uwha members cover patients from here to the VA.,168,,
1004,0.97,4237.6,4239.635,Membership require travel between sites.,168,,

1050,0.97,4373.769,4376.939,We know this is the biggest Emitter of carbon pollution.,179,,

1053,0.97,4381.443,4385.114,And hopefully face less economic hardship.,179,,
1054,0.97,4385.114,4392.488,The story that was shared on the Tradeoff on whether you ride or take the bus as an example.,179,,
1055,0.97,4392.488,4398.16,We don't want anyone to be in a situation where either is a financial hardship.,179,,
1056,0.97,4398.16,4406.568,And to make the decision that is better for the environment is where we hope to Incentivize this.,179,,

1065,0.97,4432.361,4437.299,Particularly in district 2 to help folks come to understand why this is so important.,181,,

1077,0.97,4475.771,4480.042,You've been engaged with the community for a long time on this very concept.,182,,
1078,0.97,4480.042,4489.151,"And for us Council colleagues, I'd like to have a few more conversations here at the table as we think through policy concepts, both with workers, advocates, local businesses.",182,,
1079,0.97,4489.151,4493.488,And any ideas that you all have for who needs to be at the table.,182,,
1080,0.97,4493.488,4494.523,We'd welcome that as well.,182,,
1081,0.97,4494.523,4501.296,To make sure we're thinking what it would look like to get more transit passes into workers hands.,182,,
1082,0.97,4501.296,4509.905,"And we will have conversation with some of the business folks who have also been, I think, providing a valuable perspective on how to make this apply more equitably.",182,,
1083,0.97,4509.905,4515.511,"We know there are some businesses who do provide Orca passes, which we appreciate.",182,,
1084,0.97,4515.511,4524.119,"But for example, it's challenging when those Orca passes are offered in an executive building but then not offered to the service workers from that same company.",182,,
1085,0.97,4524.119,4530.225,So that's the type of example from the type of equity we're looking at.,182,,
1086,0.97,4530.225,4534.396,"In this point, it is open-ended for ideas.",182,,
1087,0.97,4534.396,4538.433,"Your ideas, input and direction is appreciated both from the community and our colleagues.",182,,
1088,0.97,4538.433,4546.041,"With that, I will turn it over to anybody who would like to start us off on the panel.",182,,
1089,0.97,4546.041,4552.848,I just want to make one note of budget action.,183,,
1090,0.97,4552.848,4558.387,That we all collectively took that I sponsored.,183,,
1091,0.97,4558.387,4574.536,Related to the reality that the city has made a choice rather than to provide--rather than providing human services in house with our own city staff.,183,,
1092,0.97,4574.536,4574.803,Right.,184,,
1093,0.97,4574.803,4576.905,We contract out for those services.,185,,
1094,0.97,4576.905,4592.554,So this is really I think an important example of the reason why we often hear from brothers and sisters in the laboring movement.,185,,
1095,0.97,4592.554,4595.457,Their concerns about contracting out city work.,185,,
1096,0.97,4595.457,4605.5,Because city workers get transit passes.,185,,
1097,0.97,4605.5,4609.371,But those workers don't necessarily get transit passes.,185,,
1098,0.97,4609.371,4612.474,So we passed a state of legislative intent.,185,,
1099,0.97,4612.474,4629.057,"And have requested a report from the human services Department about this question of the city, sort of acting in many ways as an employer, providing transit passes for employees of Hsd contracted service providers.",185,,
1100,0.97,4629.057,4640.002,"There was an internal to the city meeting on this obligation that Hsd has recently, they believe they can provide a report to us.",185,,
1101,0.97,4640.002,4644.139,By June 30th.,185,,
1102,0.97,4644.139,4654.349,And the questions are questions such as.,185,,
1103,0.97,4654.349,4658.32,Currently has access to transit passes.,186,,
1104,0.97,4658.32,4658.687,Human services.,186,,
1105,0.97,4658.687,4659.154,Provided contracts.,186,,
1106,0.97,4659.154,4664.76,What the cost would be for the city to provide these services to those who don't.,186,,
1107,0.97,4664.76,4671.066,Whether or not there are opportunities for collaboration with King County to develop a joint program.,186,,
1108,0.97,4671.066,4675.404,That also covers the Department of community and human services contracts.,186,,
1109,0.97,4675.404,4680.909,And what are the potential funding sources existing that could exist or subsidize.,186,,
1110,0.97,4680.909,4698.493,"I think if we're going to be talking about large employers in the city providing this as a labor standard, as a benefit, we need to do more as an employer by proxy, by the fact that we are contracting these services as well.",186,,
1111,0.97,4698.493,4705.967,And I think it's going to be important conversation to bringing on large employers in support of this campaign.,186,,
1112,0.97,4705.967,4713.842,So I don't know how best to sequence that work that this Committee is going to be doing on the campaign.,186,,
1113,0.97,4713.842,4718.246,Maybe we can think about having a joint committee briefing in June or something like that.,186,,
1114,0.97,4718.246,4718.713,Yes.,187,,
1115,0.97,4718.713,4724.086,Thank you for bringing that up.,187,,
1116,0.97,4724.086,4727.422,And and I will definitely work with your office to sequence those.,187,,
1117,0.97,4727.422,4728.49,Let's kick off the panel.,187,,
1118,0.97,4728.49,4728.857,Great.,188,,
1119,0.97,4728.857,4730.325,"Well, thank you.",188,,
1120,0.97,4730.325,4731.993,For having this discussion.,188,,
1121,0.97,4731.993,4733.495,In your Committee.,188,,
1122,0.97,4733.495,4736.598,Maybe we'll start with some quick introductions.,188,,
1123,0.97,4736.598,4738.366,For the folks who are up here.,188,,
1124,0.97,4738.366,4740.435,Or you can introduce yourselves if you want to.,188,,
1125,0.97,4740.435,4746.775,"So I was thinking, we could each say our name and who we are.",188,,
1126,0.97,4746.775,4756.184,And then anything about your own experience with transit benefits at current or past jobs as kind of a little Intro?,188,,
1127,0.97,4756.184,4757.819,So I'll start.,188,,
1128,0.97,4757.819,4759.688,My name is Katie Wilson.,188,,
1129,0.97,4759.688,4762.958,I'm the General Secretary of the transit riders Union.,188,,
1130,0.97,4762.958,4768.33,And I guess the transit riders Union kind of pays me something for transportation.,188,,
1131,0.97,4768.33,4771.867,I've never had a job in the past where I got any kind of transit benefit.,188,,
1132,0.97,4771.867,4776.571,And I've been organizing with the transit riders Union for some years now.,188,,
1133,0.97,4776.571,4787.282,"And really, part of the kind of impetus to start the organization was that there was a space of a few years starting in kind of 2008, with the recession, where fares went up.",188,,
1134,0.97,4787.282,4789.985,Like four times in the course of a few years.,188,,
1135,0.97,4789.985,4791.486,And just like basically doubled.,188,,
1136,0.97,4791.486,4803.231,"And we did a calculation at that point, about like if you're a minimum wage worker, going to work, like how much of your time are you actually spending just to pay for your bus commute to and from work?",188,,
1137,0.97,4803.231,4805.867,And it was like 40 minutes or something like that.,188,,
1138,0.97,4805.867,4808.67,So you just imagine going to work in your first 40 minutes.,188,,
1139,0.97,4808.67,4811.173,You're just covering your bus ride to and from work.,188,,
1140,0.97,4811.173,4814.976,That's the kind of thing where you can really see the impact that that has.,188,,
1141,0.97,4814.976,4817.979,And especially if you're having to commute a long distance.,188,,
1142,0.97,4817.979,4821.95,So you're like spending even more of your time as well.,188,,
1143,0.97,4821.95,4822.25,So anyway.,188,,
1144,0.97,4822.25,4823.051,That's my introduction.,188,,
1145,0.97,4823.051,4827.122,And I'll pass it to Whoever wants to go next.,188,,
1146,0.97,4827.122,4829.124,Hi.,189,,
1147,0.97,4829.124,4831.293,Thank you all for being here.,189,,
1148,0.97,4831.293,4835.096,My name is Britney Bush Bolay.,189,,
1149,0.97,4835.096,4836.832,And chair of Seattle group.,189,,
1150,0.97,4836.832,4843.038,I was just thinking this morning actually about when I had my own newborn Kiddo.,189,,
1151,0.97,4843.038,4845.607,And he hated the car.,189,,
1152,0.97,4845.607,4858.053,"He hated the car so much, he would scream in his car seat so loud, it wasn't safe for me to drive.",189,,
1153,0.97,4858.053,4859.754,Like I couldn't concentrate on the road.,189,,
1154,0.97,4859.754,4862.457,Not to mention his own misery.,189,,
1155,0.97,4862.457,4864.859,So we took the bus all the time.,189,,
1156,0.97,4864.859,4872.4,"So for me in that moment it really made me realize, transit is freedom.",189,,
1157,0.97,4872.4,4878.039,It Looty let me get out of the house and out in the world with a Kiddo as a new mom.,189,,
1158,0.97,4878.039,4882.677,When you're in one of the most vulnerable Andizealating times in your life.,189,,
1159,0.97,4882.677,4883.645,Amen.,190,,
1160,0.97,4883.645,4883.912,Yeah.,191,,
1161,0.97,4883.912,4885.18,I had a transit pass.,191,,
1162,0.97,4885.18,4893.989,"I could get on the bus, go places and still be Puknow, a person in the world.",191,,
1163,0.97,4893.989,4896.091,I want everybody to have that freedom.,191,,
1164,0.97,4896.091,4900.428,Regardless of who you work for and what type of employment status is.,191,,
1165,0.97,4900.428,4901.963,I think it's important.,191,,
1166,0.97,4901.963,4902.597,Okay.,192,,
1167,0.97,4902.597,4902.864,I'll go.,192,,
1168,0.97,4902.864,4904.199,As I said earlier.,192,,
1169,0.97,4904.199,4906.201,My name is Jessica.,192,,
1170,0.97,4906.201,4908.503,And I work at trader Joes.,192,,
1171,0.97,4908.503,4909.971,I worked there for 12 years.,192,,
1172,0.97,4909.971,4912.507,And we don't have transit passes.,192,,
1173,0.97,4912.507,4920.282,And I would definitely like trader Joes to provide transit passes to all of its employees.,192,,
1174,0.97,4920.282,4924.152,I think all of us do take the bus.,192,,
1175,0.97,4924.152,4925.253,I haven't taken the poll.,192,,
1176,0.97,4925.253,4930.125,But I know most haven't done the pretax that is offered to us.,192,,
1177,0.97,4930.125,4931.726,And Yeah.,192,,
1178,0.97,4931.726,4934.062,"As a citizen, I don't have a car.",192,,
1179,0.97,4934.062,4937.299,I've chosen not to for many reasons.,192,,
1180,0.97,4937.299,4940.835,And I like taking the bulls.,192,,
1181,0.97,4940.835,4944.739,"And because of recent injuries, I've had to take it more.",192,,
1182,0.97,4944.739,4949.644,And it definitely has increased my cost.,192,,
1183,0.97,4949.644,4964.926,"And I think that like I said, with my Coworker, having to decide, you know, which one is more equitable, instead of making it heads above that, the public transit is the way to go.",192,,
1184,0.97,4964.926,4966.962,Definitely says where we are as a society.,192,,
1185,0.97,4966.962,4974.536,And I think Seattle can lead the way and show a different way of doing things that is the way of the future.,192,,
1186,0.97,4974.536,4976.237,So thank you.,192,,
1187,0.97,4976.237,4976.538,Hello.,193,,
1188,0.97,4976.538,4978.206,My name is Ty.,193,,
1189,0.97,4978.206,4982.477,I'm the field Organizer for the transit riders Union.,193,,
1190,0.97,4982.477,4986.047,"Last year, I used to work for a terrible company.",193,,
1191,0.97,4986.047,4986.348,I hated it.,193,,
1192,0.97,4986.348,4989.084,But they were a contractor of Amtrak.,193,,
1193,0.97,4989.084,4994.255,Which like moves billions of people around the country all the time.,193,,
1194,0.97,4994.255,4997.225,But even Amtrak workers don't get a pass.,193,,
1195,0.97,4997.225,5002.764,Even though they're in the Kweisii space that governmental space that they like to be in.,193,,
1196,0.97,5002.764,5005.4,And as a contractor for them.,193,,
1197,0.97,5005.4,5006.835,I definitely didn't get a pass.,193,,
1198,0.97,5006.835,5008.103,And I worked overnight.,193,,
1199,0.97,5008.103,5014.209,Would a pass really have helped with the way our bus systems are?,193,,
1200,0.97,5014.209,5017.245,Now I work for human services provider.,193,,
1201,0.97,5017.245,5019.381,I work for $1.50 more.,193,,
1202,0.97,5019.381,5020.782,I pay for Healthcare.,193,,
1203,0.97,5020.782,5022.217,And contribute to 43B.,193,,
1204,0.97,5022.217,5024.519,So I took a pay cut to do this work.,193,,
1205,0.97,5024.519,5027.255,And I didn't realize that until my first paycheck.,193,,
1206,0.97,5027.255,5030.425,And I really still love the work.,193,,
1207,0.97,5030.425,5034.929,And it's really been bothering me the way the legislation is.,193,,
1208,0.97,5034.929,5037.032,We'll talk about it later.,193,,
1209,0.97,5037.032,5039.434,This idea that it could be less than 100%.,193,,
1210,0.97,5039.434,5046.641,"I think that going forward, if this isn't 100% then it's useless.",193,,
1211,0.97,5046.641,5046.975,Pointless.,193,,
1212,0.97,5046.975,5053.815,I was thinking about how wages have not kept up with inflation or prices or anything for decades.,193,,
1213,0.97,5053.815,5054.082,Decades.,193,,
1214,0.97,5054.082,5054.349,Decades.,193,,
1215,0.97,5054.349,5056.251,And we think that 50% is going to change something.,193,,
1216,0.97,5056.251,5060.455,We have to start giving away this free stuff that we've already paid toward.,193,,
1217,0.97,5060.455,5075.27,"Otherwise, we are just setting ourselves up for another failed piece of legislation that leaves too many people in the gaps fix we don't know quite what this looks like.",193,,
1218,0.97,5075.27,5076.371,You talked about work.,193,,
1219,0.97,5076.371,5087.982,We have to respond to the advent and influx of contract work.,193,,
1220,0.97,5087.982,5089.584,100% subsidy.,193,,
1221,0.97,5089.584,5091.953,Then we're failing the constituents.,193,,
1222,0.97,5091.953,5100.695,And the legislation will be another piece of lip service to what we can actually do with the money we have.,193,,
1223,0.97,5100.695,5101.963,So I don't know.,193,,
1224,0.97,5101.963,5103.198,I'm emotional about this.,193,,
1225,0.97,5103.198,5106.434,I feel like now is the time to do something meaningful.,193,,
1226,0.97,5106.434,5111.706,Now is the time to capture people's imagination with what Seattle can be.,193,,
1227,0.97,5111.706,5115.376,"And if it isn't everything, we shouldn't even bother doing it.",193,,
1228,0.97,5115.376,5117.212,I think there's a lot more at the table.,193,,
1229,0.97,5117.212,5118.746,More than it has been in the past.,193,,
1230,0.97,5118.746,5120.982,And a lot more faces.,193,,
1231,0.97,5120.982,5123.485,And I want you all to know this is serious for folks.,193,,
1232,0.97,5123.485,5128.223,And this is going to be a lot of Life-Changing moments.,193,,
1233,0.97,5128.223,5130.225,"For me, $100 is a lot per month.",193,,
1234,0.97,5130.225,5131.159,I'm happy to pay it.,193,,
1235,0.97,5131.159,5133.695,I'm so happy I can pay it.,193,,
1236,0.97,5133.695,5135.363,But if I didn't have to.,193,,
1237,0.97,5135.363,5138.7,I wonder what that would go for as well.,193,,
1238,0.97,5138.7,5143.204,So please consider that when you're thinking about what slashes to start making.,193,,
1239,0.97,5143.204,5152.213,What people to start excluding when we think about what the legislation looks like.,193,,
1240,0.97,5152.213,5152.447,Hi.,194,,
1241,0.97,5152.447,5158.486,"I'm Tobias grill, He/Him pronouns.",194,,
1242,0.97,5158.486,5160.088,We're a workers rights organization.,194,,
1243,0.97,5160.088,5160.955,We also do housing.,194,,
1244,0.97,5160.955,5162.957,Contract through the Ols.,194,,
1245,0.97,5162.957,5170.131,"In terms of my personal experience, I've only had a transit pass once in my life.",194,,
1246,0.97,5170.131,5172.967,That was when I worked in Olympia.,194,,
1247,0.97,5172.967,5174.302,Before the free transit.,194,,
1248,0.97,5174.302,5174.502,Yes.,194,,
1249,0.97,5174.502,5174.769,Olympia.,194,,
1250,0.97,5174.769,5177.238,And it was a game Changer.,194,,
1251,0.97,5177.238,5180.008,I wasn't making very much money working for the city.,194,,
1252,0.97,5180.008,5182.443,The bus fare was steep.,194,,
1253,0.97,5182.443,5185.446,And having that free pass allowed me a lot of flexibility.,194,,
1254,0.97,5185.446,5189.784,I didn't have to nickel and dime with my change.,194,,
1255,0.97,5189.784,5201.396,I didn't have to stress about making it to the transit in time to pick up a new one for that month.,194,,
1256,0.97,5201.396,5204.699,"In my job now, I travel a fair amount in the city.",194,,
1257,0.97,5204.699,5206.334,Multiple times during the day.,194,,
1258,0.97,5206.334,5209.938,It's not a simple one destination to another destination.,194,,
1259,0.97,5209.938,5212.574,I'm Someoe who would fall in the hole of a commute in the morning.,194,,
1260,0.97,5212.574,5214.342,Then a commute in the afternoon.,194,,
1261,0.97,5214.342,5215.543,And then a commute later.,194,,
1262,0.97,5215.543,5222.517,"And that adds up very, very quickly for workers.",194,,
1263,0.97,5222.517,5224.819,Who don't make their transfer times.,194,,
1264,0.97,5224.819,5232.26,"It is not technically cheaper for me to drive my car, if you go by the Federal reimbursement rates.",194,,
1265,0.97,5232.26,5238.533,But with my wages and what happens when you're a relatively low-wage worker.,194,,
1266,0.97,5238.533,5247.041,"The gas costs alone, which are the immediate ones up front.",194,,
1267,0.97,5247.041,5249.444,Than it is to take a bus during the day.,194,,
1268,0.97,5249.444,5250.979,On a purely personal level.,194,,
1269,0.97,5250.979,5258.653,"Leaving aside my clients and community members, I would greatly appreciate a subsidized transit pass.",194,,
1270,0.97,5258.653,5259.053,Great.,195,,
1271,0.97,5259.053,5259.554,"Thank you, everyone.",195,,
1272,0.97,5259.554,5267.629,"I think what we're going to do next is walk through a very, fairly short slide presentation.",195,,
1273,0.97,5267.629,5272.233,Which will give us context for% why we're thinking about this issue and why we were at.,195,,
1274,0.97,5272.233,5276.037,"If you were paying attention last year, this might look familiar.",195,,
1275,0.97,5276.037,5282.41,Because we kind of just updated one we did in the fall.,195,,
1276,0.97,5282.41,5285.78,So here we go.,195,,
1277,0.97,5285.78,5286.014,First.,195,,
1278,0.97,5286.014,5287.315,As a little background.,195,,
1279,0.97,5287.315,5287.949,Here in Seattle.,195,,
1280,0.97,5287.949,5291.586,We're already in many ways a national leader on transit.,195,,
1281,0.97,5291.586,5299.727,Transit Ridership has been rising in general over the years while many cities nationwide have been experiencing declines in transit Ridership.,195,,
1282,0.97,5299.727,5307.568,And that's largely due to major investments that we all have made in our regional transit system.,195,,
1283,0.97,5307.568,5312.774,Both light rail and our bus system.,195,,
1284,0.97,5312.774,5314.976,Transit service and infrastructure over the past years.,195,,
1285,0.97,5314.976,5319.08,We are also a national leader in free and reduced programs.,195,,
1286,0.97,5319.08,5321.516,The Orca lift program.,195,,
1287,0.97,5321.516,5327.822,The transit riders Union were involved in getting implemented several years ago.,195,,
1288,0.97,5327.822,5331.459,Is a program many have looked to and tried to copy.,195,,
1289,0.97,5331.459,5337.899,And there's a number of reduced fare programs that we come are great.,195,,
1290,0.97,5337.899,5343.104,And we also have several programs and laws that encourage drive alone commuting.,195,,
1291,0.97,5343.104,5344.338,We're starting with the positive here.,195,,
1292,0.97,5344.338,5345.907,This is good.,195,,
1293,0.97,5345.907,5346.541,And--okay.,195,,
1294,0.97,5346.541,5354.115,"I'm going to pause at each slide, in case people have things they want to add or any discussion.",195,,
1295,0.97,5354.115,5362.223,One thing I will say about this is that the transit Ridership rising here has actually kind of Plateaued.,196,,
1296,0.97,5362.223,5367.862,"This news came out, I think in December.",196,,
1297,0.97,5367.862,5370.331,So we're actually no longer transit Ridership rising.,196,,
1298,0.97,5370.331,5373.401,And when we look at our carbon reduction goals.,196,,
1299,0.97,5373.401,5380.575,This is something that we need to kind of get back on track.,196,,
1300,0.97,5380.575,5386.614,So we're doing well in many very Car-Dominated city.,196,,
1301,0.97,5386.614,5389.05,As you'll know if you spend any time getting around the city.,196,,
1302,0.97,5389.05,5393.121,And this has a lot of really negative impacts.,196,,
1303,0.97,5393.121,5394.922,Our greenhouse gas emissions are continuing to rise.,196,,
1304,0.97,5394.922,5400.027,We're not on track to meet Seattle's climate goals.,196,,
1305,0.97,5400.027,5405.6,These are the largest contributor to our city emissions.,196,,
1306,0.97,5405.6,5415.276,Over half come from passenger vehicles and the Pollutants from cars harm health.,196,,
1307,0.97,5415.276,5417.345,Likely to live near busy roads.,196,,
1308,0.97,5417.345,5418.679,And people of color.,196,,
1309,0.97,5418.679,5425.82,Seniors and people with disabilities are more likely to be killed by traffic violence in our city.,196,,
1310,0.97,5425.82,5426.12,Okay.,197,,
1311,0.97,5426.12,5431.526,I'm just going to run through this.,197,,
1312,0.97,5431.526,5434.996,So we also some of the worst traffic in the nation.,198,,
1313,0.97,5434.996,5440.568,And that has impacts on people's time people spending hours on the road.,198,,
1314,0.97,5440.568,5443.104,"And has impacts on or economy, right?",198,,
1315,0.97,5443.104,5447.408,"You know, businesses need things to move.",198,,
1316,0.97,5447.408,5453.614,"And lower wage workers are most likely to have long commutes, largely due to housing costs and displacement.",198,,
1317,0.97,5453.614,5456.551,Andalso to spend a large part of income on their transportation.,198,,
1318,0.97,5456.551,5458.152,Can I say something real quick?,199,,
1319,0.97,5458.152,5458.753,Go for it.,200,,
1320,0.97,5458.753,5466.294,"Whenever we meet with community members, looking for community input on their needs for housing employment.",201,,
1321,0.97,5466.294,5473.0,One thing that consistently comes up with their reliance on public transit.,201,,
1322,0.97,5473.0,5476.037,Workers are likely to be in shift work.,201,,
1323,0.97,5476.037,5480.107,General low-wage jobs with irregular hours.,201,,
1324,0.97,5480.107,5486.948,So we are among those disproportionately affected by those long commutes.,201,,
1325,0.97,5486.948,5488.182,Totally.,202,,
1326,0.97,5488.182,5491.352,Okay.,203,,
1327,0.97,5491.352,5497.191,And benefits which we're here to talk about today are effective.,203,,
1328,0.97,5497.191,5504.332,Multiple studies have shown that these are effective in shifting commuters toward public transit.,203,,
1329,0.97,5504.332,5513.374,This is just one example that found employees who provided free or subsidized transit pass had 156% higher odds.,203,,
1330,0.97,5513.374,5516.01,All else equaled compared to their counterparts.,203,,
1331,0.97,5516.01,5518.312,And I think that is really significant.,203,,
1332,0.97,5518.312,5526.821,"Especially like one of the things that we found as last year, you know, our organizers did a whole bunch of outreach to workers in Seattle.",203,,
1333,0.97,5526.821,5531.626,"And you know, a lot of people are kind of like hobbling together.",203,,
1334,0.97,5531.626,5534.228,It's not like they do the same thing every day.,203,,
1335,0.97,5534.228,5540.735,And having that transit pass in hand really tips the balance over to transit.,203,,
1336,0.97,5540.735,5541.903,Really frequently.,203,,
1337,0.97,5541.903,5545.907,"And as a student, I went to U-Dub.",204,,
1338,0.97,5545.907,5548.776,What are we?,204,,
1339,0.97,5548.776,5549.043,Bulldogs?,204,,
1340,0.97,5549.043,5549.877,Something like that?,204,,
1341,0.97,5549.877,5551.312,I have terrible school pride.,205,,
1342,0.97,5551.312,5555.249,I like the learning part more than the thing.,205,,
1343,0.97,5555.249,5558.219,But I went to U-Dub.,205,,
1344,0.97,5558.219,5559.954,And I had the transit pass.,205,,
1345,0.97,5559.954,5560.688,I used it so much.,205,,
1346,0.97,5560.688,5562.657,I used it to go down the street.,205,,
1347,0.97,5562.657,5563.424,There's always a bus going.,205,,
1348,0.97,5563.424,5565.359,And you hop on and it's nothing.,205,,
1349,0.97,5565.359,5568.162,And I think one of the things that encouraged me when I was doing outreach.,205,,
1350,0.97,5568.162,5569.73,We went down to like West Lake.,205,,
1351,0.97,5569.73,5572.967,And there's a lot of folks like working at retail stores.,205,,
1352,0.97,5572.967,5574.168,A lot of young kids.,205,,
1353,0.97,5574.168,5577.905,And a lot of them are like U- Dub students.,205,,
1354,0.97,5577.905,5579.206,So they have this free pass.,205,,
1355,0.97,5579.206,5583.978,"But if they were not students and they were still working that job, which at some point, they will be.",205,,
1356,0.97,5583.978,5590.418,That they're going to have to get a car or start paying for this all of a sudden.,205,,
1357,0.97,5590.418,5598.059,If we want to start effecting a culture.,205,,
1358,0.97,5598.059,5598.926,Let's be honest.,205,,
1359,0.97,5598.926,5600.895,A lot of college kids do work.,205,,
1360,0.97,5600.895,5602.997,They're already got one.,205,,
1361,0.97,5602.997,5603.397,It's assumed.,205,,
1362,0.97,5603.397,5607.134,It's just like this seamless transition.,205,,
1363,0.97,5607.134,5608.603,"Honestly, it's really hard to not have a car.",205,,
1364,0.97,5608.603,5611.806,"As much as I do take the bus, I also do own a car.",205,,
1365,0.97,5611.806,5614.642,Just because it's also handy when you have to drive other places.,205,,
1366,0.97,5614.642,5616.811,And I came to the city needing a car.,205,,
1367,0.97,5616.811,5619.18,Because I had to drive up to Everett all the time.,205,,
1368,0.97,5619.18,5621.615,So if I had to come here with a pass already.,205,,
1369,0.97,5621.615,5625.386,"Who knows what jobs I would have taken, what opportunities would have been obvious.",205,,
1370,0.97,5625.386,5630.691,"But I kind of came here and decided, I live far away from my job, I need to get a car.",205,,
1371,0.97,5630.691,5634.528,So that's what I did within a few months of living here.,205,,
1372,0.97,5634.528,5636.998,If there had been a different path forward for me.,205,,
1373,0.97,5636.998,5639.066,A lot of folks would take that.,205,,
1374,0.97,5639.066,5644.305,And Wheeze should definitely make that available for them.,205,,
1375,0.97,5644.305,5644.572,Okay.,206,,
1376,0.97,5644.572,5653.114,And we did the commute survey last year and asked people who already have transit benefits through the employer kind Ofwhat that means for them.,206,,
1377,0.97,5653.114,5656.083,"Turns out, people have transit benefits.",206,,
1378,0.97,5656.083,5661.322,It Meaningst world for me and my commute.,206,,
1379,0.97,5661.322,5661.689,It's fantastic.,206,,
1380,0.97,5661.689,5664.458,Means no second thought.,206,,
1381,0.97,5664.458,5669.33,"In all honesty, it's a near necessity for me.",206,,
1382,0.97,5669.33,5671.165,No reason not to offer it.,206,,
1383,0.97,5671.165,5678.906,It's a fantastic relief and makes me feel like I'm making pace since I don't have to spend so much on transit fares.,206,,
1384,0.97,5678.906,5680.307,The illusion of a raise.,207,,
1385,0.97,5680.307,5684.111,I would like to add real quick.,208,,
1386,0.97,5684.111,5689.95,A couple of colleagues spent the afternoon canvassing up and down third Avenue during the evening commute.,208,,
1387,0.97,5689.95,5692.053,Going to the bus stops and talking to people.,208,,
1388,0.97,5692.053,5693.587,And that's exactly what I heard.,208,,
1389,0.97,5693.587,5695.523,"A small portion of the people said, Oh, Yeah.",208,,
1390,0.97,5695.523,5698.192,I already have a transit pass for my job.,208,,
1391,0.97,5698.192,5698.893,It's amazing.,208,,
1392,0.97,5698.893,5700.361,And like their faces would light up.,208,,
1393,0.97,5700.361,5702.296,And they were so excited.,208,,
1394,0.97,5702.296,5706.634,"And everyone else who didn't have one the you're like, okay.",208,,
1395,0.97,5706.634,5707.301,Sign me up.,208,,
1396,0.97,5707.301,5708.536,Id would love to have that.,208,,
1397,0.97,5708.536,5711.839,"And Yeah, I'll reach out to my Councilmembers.",208,,
1398,0.97,5711.839,5715.209,So it's an incredibly Popularproposal.,208,,
1399,0.97,5715.209,5715.476,Yeah.,209,,
1400,0.97,5715.476,5716.911,"I would second that, too.",209,,
1401,0.97,5716.911,5722.75,Consider me reached out to.,210,,
1402,0.97,5722.75,5723.184,Yeah.,211,,
1403,0.97,5723.184,5726.72,So then this next slide.,211,,
1404,0.97,5726.72,5730.658,"Actually, Jessica already walked us through this in her public comment.",211,,
1405,0.97,5730.658,5733.027,According to her survey.,211,,
1406,0.97,5733.027,5737.932,"We found 100,000 or more, vast majority of them get some kind of transportation benefits.",211,,
1407,0.97,5737.932,5741.035,"And workers making $50,000 or less.",211,,
1408,0.97,5741.035,5743.104,Only half report getting transportation benefits.,211,,
1409,0.97,5743.104,5748.242,"Katie, you mentioned this is a Nonscientific survey of folks that you guys have canvassed.",212,,
1410,0.97,5748.242,5752.179,But do we have a better sense of where we can get that data from?,212,,
1411,0.97,5752.179,5754.582,And for folks that don't know Karina Bull.,212,,
1412,0.97,5754.582,5756.517,She is central staff.,212,,
1413,0.97,5756.517,5758.052,And staffs on issues of labor as well.,212,,
1414,0.97,5758.052,5760.688,I don't know if that's a report that exists.,212,,
1415,0.97,5760.688,5763.524,Or if you've done this because there is a lack of such data?,212,,
1416,0.97,5763.524,5765.826,"Well, the next slide is --",213,,
1417,0.97,5765.826,5766.193,All right.,214,,
1418,0.97,5766.193,5766.527,Oh.,214,,
1419,0.97,5766.527,5767.027,There was an error.,214,,
1420,0.97,5767.027,5768.329,"Yes, I see.",215,,
1421,0.97,5768.329,5768.662,Yeah.,216,,
1422,0.97,5768.662,5770.831,The next slide is a graph.,216,,
1423,0.97,5770.831,5771.232,If it --,216,,
1424,0.97,5771.232,5771.866,It's okay.,217,,
1425,0.97,5771.866,5773.501,We have it in front of us.,217,,
1426,0.97,5773.501,5779.373,"Well, there should be a graph there from the Puget sound regional Council.",218,,
1427,0.97,5779.373,5782.376,Which is more of like a regional travel survey.,218,,
1428,0.97,5782.376,5787.148,"So they find, it's not as stark a difference as what we found in the folks that we surveyed.",218,,
1429,0.97,5787.148,5789.683,Which kind of makes sense.,218,,
1430,0.97,5789.683,5795.022,"Because I think regionally, just fewer people are getting transit benefits regardless of their income.",218,,
1431,0.97,5795.022,5798.759,But it was a similar situation in this regional survey.,218,,
1432,0.97,5798.759,5801.896,Where higher paid workers are likely to get benefits.,218,,
1433,0.97,5801.896,5808.335,But I don't know that we have kind of like a representative sample survey of Seattle specifically.,218,,
1434,0.97,5808.335,5811.138,Maybe that data exists somewhere and could be put together.,218,,
1435,0.97,5811.138,5812.64,But I'm not aware of it.,218,,
1436,0.97,5812.64,5819.079,"I would like to jump in real quick on the 50,000 number.",219,,
1437,0.97,5819.079,5822.416,In a different presentation today.,219,,
1438,0.97,5822.416,5824.351,A sound enforcement fare.,219,,
1439,0.97,5824.351,5824.885,And another meeting.,219,,
1440,0.97,5824.885,5832.193,"They mentioned that the $50,000 income line was a very clear divider, actually, within fare enforcement.",219,,
1441,0.97,5832.193,5837.131,"People making $50,000 or less, were far more likely to be involved in the fare enforcement system.",219,,
1442,0.97,5837.131,5842.436,They were far more likely to have paid their fare because they were unable.,219,,
1443,0.97,5842.436,5850.811,And a large portion of those people who do have income and employment.,219,,
1444,0.97,5850.811,5858.719,"But just not High-Paying income are in the gap area, where the subsidies we have available.",219,,
1445,0.97,5858.719,5862.923,They're clearly using transit because they need it.,219,,
1446,0.97,5862.923,5871.865,And that they're hopefully going to get caught and not paying.,219,,
1447,0.97,5871.865,5880.841,One thing that stands out to me that I find odd with the data is the offer that I don't use.,220,,
1448,0.97,5880.841,5890.551,"And the offer that I use, that for folks, under $25,000, the offer that I use is 7%.",220,,
1449,0.97,5890.551,5893.687,Which is just a strange Staivityic to me.,220,,
1450,0.97,5893.687,5898.292,"I mean, I--it's not a survey that parents conducted.",220,,
1451,0.97,5898.292,5907.701,But I don't know if any organizing or anecdotal information could glean on why a considerable number.,220,,
1452,0.97,5907.701,5917.311,"There seems to be some employers that are offering and folks that are under $25,000 are not taking advantage of it.",220,,
1453,0.97,5917.311,5919.313,Is my read of that Statistic.,220,,
1454,0.97,5919.313,5920.914,I can speak to that.,221,,
1455,0.97,5920.914,5922.016,"Unless you want to, Katie.",221,,
1456,0.97,5922.016,5922.917,You go first.,222,,
1457,0.97,5922.917,5924.485,I was going to say.,223,,
1458,0.97,5924.485,5927.721,"First off, there is kind of what Jessica alluded to.",223,,
1459,0.97,5927.721,5934.828,This idea that there are folks out there who cannot navigate or don't understand the programs that their jobs offer.,223,,
1460,0.97,5934.828,5938.899,"They're honestly, the outreach for these kind of things within business is like terrible.",223,,
1461,0.97,5938.899,5939.6,Sometimes it's really good.,223,,
1462,0.97,5939.6,5942.936,"If people are proud of it, they advertise it.",223,,
1463,0.97,5942.936,5945.739,But it's not like somebody can sign you up.,223,,
1464,0.97,5945.739,5946.607,And there's taxes involved.,223,,
1465,0.97,5946.607,5947.942,And numbers you don't understand.,223,,
1466,0.97,5947.942,5950.611,So a lot of folks might have it and don't use it.,223,,
1467,0.97,5950.611,5957.117,"I would say, if you make $25,000 I promise you, you live very far from your job.",223,,
1468,0.97,5957.117,5971.265,"For me, I worked overnight and I was reading an article about how overnight people almost always have to have cars just because transit you know, I have to either show up an hour early or 7 minutes late and then you're screwed.",223,,
1469,0.97,5971.265,5973.067,Just working those times.,223,,
1470,0.97,5973.067,5975.536,"I can see for me, I don't have any proof of that.",223,,
1471,0.97,5975.536,5977.604,But when I see that number.,223,,
1472,0.97,5977.604,5978.972,That's kind of how I see it.,223,,
1473,0.97,5978.972,5982.876,"If you're making under $25,000.",223,,
1474,0.97,5982.876,5988.148,"At that point, you're probably getting a lemon of a car and driving it as much as you can.",223,,
1475,0.97,5988.148,5991.251,"With that, that's great context.",224,,
1476,0.97,5991.251,5995.189,Would some of those scenarios fall under the I don't know category?,224,,
1477,0.97,5995.189,5996.29,Like the navigation issues?,224,,
1478,0.97,5996.29,5998.492,"I mean, because that's a category as well.",224,,
1479,0.97,5998.492,6004.264,Because if it's sort of a particular Byzantine or convoluted system.,224,,
1480,0.97,6004.264,6006.166,Maybe some folks would respond under that.,224,,
1481,0.97,6006.166,6007.735,I guess you could put them under both.,224,,
1482,0.97,6007.735,6012.473,"Because it could be, you know, the system is so complicated, you don't know as an employee.",224,,
1483,0.97,6012.473,6015.709,Or it could be the system is so complicated.,224,,
1484,0.97,6015.709,6019.947,And I know it's complicated so I don't even bother with it.,224,,
1485,0.97,6019.947,6022.616,"So there could be overlap between those, I guess.",224,,
1486,0.97,6022.616,6044.671,"I would imagine there are other kinds of scenarios, with somebody whose job Providessubsidized transit, maybe doesn't tick it because of a complex life responsibilities that make taking transit difficult.",225,,
1487,0.97,6044.671,6055.616,"For instance, you know, maybe you work in a place that would require, in order for you to get to child care, require a transfer, which would mean you show up to child care to pick up your Kiddo late.",225,,
1488,0.97,6055.616,6059.086,And it's a dollar a minute for every minute you're late.,225,,
1489,0.97,6059.086,6061.321,So--and doctors appointments.,225,,
1490,0.97,6061.321,6073.367,"I mean, there are the types of things that people have in their day-to-day lives that can make transit difficult.",225,,
1491,0.97,6073.367,6075.636,"Hopefully we're all here, trying to make it less difficult.",225,,
1492,0.97,6075.636,6083.077,And I think the really important Statistic here is that 56% of the folks who were surveyed said it is not offered at all.,226,,
1493,0.97,6083.077,6091.685,So that's the number that we're trying to change.,226,,
1494,0.97,6091.685,6092.119,Okay.,227,,
1495,0.97,6092.119,6094.054,We have about 10 more minutes.,227,,
1496,0.97,6094.054,6094.321,Great.,228,,
1497,0.97,6094.321,6096.19,I will zoom through this then.,228,,
1498,0.97,6096.19,6101.762,"Wow, we're not getting pictures anymore.",228,,
1499,0.97,6101.762,6105.099,So partly this disparity is an outcome of policy.,228,,
1500,0.97,6105.099,6105.799,City policy plays a role.,228,,
1501,0.97,6105.799,6117.311,And one of the things to notice about Seattle's policy is that we have a commute trip reduction program that doesn't require transit benefits.,228,,
1502,0.97,6117.311,6125.652,But does require employers with large work sites to do certain things to try to reduce their Drive-Alone commute rates.,228,,
1503,0.97,6125.652,6137.998,"And that program really focuses on large work sites like corporate headquarters, which means that, you know, this CH tend to be Higher-Paid workers, you know, 9:00 to 5:00 kind of work sites.",228,,
1504,0.97,6137.998,6143.67,"That doesn't touch the retail hospitality, grocery industries that we're talking about.",228,,
1505,0.97,6143.67,6149.61,Where lower wage workers are Tinding to not get this benefit.,228,,
1506,0.97,6149.61,6153.447,So I need to see what our next slide is going to be.,228,,
1507,0.97,6153.447,6154.581,Limbo.,229,,
1508,0.97,6154.581,6155.249,Okay.,230,,
1509,0.97,6155.249,6155.816,So Yeah.,230,,
1510,0.97,6155.816,6161.755,So city policy is kind of part of the reason we're in the situation we're in.,230,,
1511,0.97,6161.755,6164.858,"And also, city policy can fix it.",230,,
1512,0.97,6164.858,6166.86,Partly.,230,,
1513,0.97,6166.86,6167.027,So.,230,,
1514,0.97,6167.027,6175.536,"And Seattle is really already begun this work by passing a commuter benefits ordinance in 2018, which just went into effect this January.",230,,
1515,0.97,6175.536,6192.519,And that ordinance requires businesses with 20 or more employees to offer their employees the opportunity to do the pretax payroll deduction that Jessica was referring to that trader Joe's already does and many businesses already do to pay for employee transit expenses.,230,,
1516,0.97,6192.519,6194.354,The employee paying for transit.,230,,
1517,0.97,6194.354,6199.326,But it's less expensive because they not having to pay taxes to pay for those wages.,230,,
1518,0.97,6199.326,6210.671,"What we're proposing this year is to really strengthen that ordinance, by adding a requirement that large employers subsidize transit for all of their employees.",230,,
1519,0.97,6210.671,6230.657,"Did I hear correctly that there was some change to the tax code, as relates to our commute benefits ordinance that makes it more onerous for employers to adhere to the requirements?",231,,
1520,0.97,6230.657,6235.295,I thought I remembered seeing that there was some math on how it all worked out.,231,,
1521,0.97,6235.295,6241.935,So that it didn't actually cost employers anything to make this offer.,231,,
1522,0.97,6241.935,6246.373,And then I thought I saw something very recently about a tax code change.,231,,
1523,0.97,6246.373,6261.054,"So in 2017, the Trump tax plan, I think, made it so that employers could not deduct contributions toward transportation expenses from their corporate income tax.",232,,
1524,0.97,6261.054,6262.956,"I believe, was the change.",232,,
1525,0.97,6262.956,6265.993,And it hit Nonprofits especially hard.,232,,
1526,0.97,6265.993,6275.502,Because it actually required Nonprofits to pay unrelated business tax on any subsidies they put towards their employees transportation.,232,,
1527,0.97,6275.502,6279.539,"Now, what's happened in this past December is that part has been repealed.",232,,
1528,0.97,6279.539,6286.847,And I think Nonprofits can actually apply for a Rebated for any money they had to pay over the last couple of years.,232,,
1529,0.97,6286.847,6287.18,That's good.,232,,
1530,0.97,6287.18,6294.621,So there is still a little bit less of an inventive across the board for private employers to pay for transit.,232,,
1531,0.97,6294.621,6295.555,Thank you.,233,,
1532,0.97,6295.555,6304.498,"And at the same time, so last thing is just that we know that this legislation, increasing worker access to transit passes is great and needed.",234,,
1533,0.97,6304.498,6307.234,It's not going to solve all of our problems.,234,,
1534,0.97,6307.234,6319.513,"So at the same time, we need to be supporting and expanding programs that provide free or deeply affordable transit access for low income and very low income riders.",234,,
1535,0.97,6319.513,6331.725,"And we also need to expand and improve service, including late night and Off-Peak service for residents who ride transit all times of day and night so that it's a viable option for people.",234,,
1536,0.97,6331.725,6338.965,And Decriminalize fair nonpayment and provide a path to free for all as some of our public commentators mention the.,234,,
1537,0.97,6338.965,6339.533,This is great.,235,,
1538,0.97,6339.533,6351.545,"On that last point, are you also engaged with folks at the King County level, about enforcement issues that you have both heard about Anecdotally.",235,,
1539,0.97,6351.545,6359.72,And the data you shared which is really compelling from an equity perspective.,235,,
1540,0.97,6359.72,6363.056,A number have been engaging over the last couple of years.,236,,
1541,0.97,6363.056,6366.393,Both King County Metro and sound transit.,236,,
1542,0.97,6366.393,6370.664,On making major reforms to their fare enforcement Policyless.,236,,
1543,0.97,6370.664,6371.031,Excellent.,237,,
1544,0.97,6371.031,6373.734,And I know a lot of that work was led by many in the community.,237,,
1545,0.97,6373.734,6381.441,"And from the organization as related to folks who are dealing with fare enforcement, especially during the coldest days in Seattle.",237,,
1546,0.97,6381.441,6383.577,Comments?,237,,
1547,0.97,6383.577,6384.344,Councilmember Morales?,237,,
1548,0.97,6384.344,6385.812,"Well, just on that note.",238,,
1549,0.97,6385.812,6393.153,I would ask or offer that if we can be helpful in the conversations with sound transit.,238,,
1550,0.97,6393.153,6398.925,Which I think is more Reticent to make changes to fare enforcement.,238,,
1551,0.97,6398.925,6400.394,We can have that conversation.,238,,
1552,0.97,6400.394,6402.496,Other comments?,239,,
1553,0.97,6402.496,6403.463,Councilmember Lewis?,239,,
1554,0.97,6403.463,6403.73,Yeah.,240,,
1555,0.97,6403.73,6410.303,"So I had a great meeting earlier today, with some folks from the Pike place market.",240,,
1556,0.97,6410.303,6413.073,"Who, you know, amalgamation of very small vendors.",240,,
1557,0.97,6413.073,6429.523,"And one of their ongoing concerns is being in a position where they can somehow offer to their employees, some kind of subsidized or lower barrier Orca kind of program.",240,,
1558,0.97,6429.523,6432.993,"You know, something I'm a huge supporter for Orca for all.",240,,
1559,0.97,6432.993,6434.728,And I want to see this work.,240,,
1560,0.97,6434.728,6436.93,I think a mandate makes a lot of sense.,240,,
1561,0.97,6436.93,6439.166,And I want to work on the details of that.,240,,
1562,0.97,6439.166,6454.614,"But I'd also like to do is figure out strategies, where we can work with small businesses and sort of these Amalgamations of small businesses through a lot of these PDAS or business development.",240,,
1563,0.97,6454.614,6459.419,Or business improvement areas or business districts that want to figure similar schemes out.,240,,
1564,0.97,6459.419,6462.489,But the individual businesses themselves might not have the resources.,240,,
1565,0.97,6462.489,6466.76,"And we're in this kind of awkward space, where they're not quite big enough.",240,,
1566,0.97,6466.76,6470.43,Where we feel comfortable mandating that we're doing this.,240,,
1567,0.97,6470.43,6476.803,We're also not really in a position where we can give them a gift of public funds to do it necessarily.,240,,
1568,0.97,6476.803,6484.578,And I'd really be interested in meeting and taking advantage of the creativity of this group here to figure out ways we can have that intervention.,240,,
1569,0.97,6484.578,6488.715,"Because you know, it's--the market employs a lot of folks.",240,,
1570,0.97,6488.715,6491.384,And there's a lot of similarly situated groups.,240,,
1571,0.97,6491.384,6495.956,And I think that there could be some room for some partnerships there.,240,,
1572,0.97,6495.956,6498.024,And some other Kiensd of interventions.,240,,
1573,0.97,6498.024,6499.159,That's a great point.,241,,
1574,0.97,6499.159,6500.16,That's a wonderful point.,242,,
1575,0.97,6500.16,6501.394,Did you have a second item?,242,,
1576,0.97,6501.394,6504.397,Did I cut you off?,242,,
1577,0.97,6504.397,6504.698,No.,243,,
1578,0.97,6504.698,6507.0,We'd love to meet and talk about that.,244,,
1579,0.97,6507.0,6517.043,"I think--well, first of all, there is actually a pilot program that the state has been funding which provides a match for smaller employers that want to provide a transit benefit.",244,,
1580,0.97,6517.043,6520.413,"I think it provides a Matchup of up to $10,000.",244,,
1581,0.97,6520.413,6523.049,And it's not terribly widely publicized.,244,,
1582,0.97,6523.049,6526.019,But it has been continued for another year.,244,,
1583,0.97,6526.019,6527.053,So that's something to be aware of.,244,,
1584,0.97,6527.053,6532.993,"But I think there's this whole question of work sites, where there's a number of smaller employers there.",244,,
1585,0.97,6532.993,6537.264,"And I know University village, we heard, from doing outreach there.",244,,
1586,0.97,6537.264,6540.033,The University village has kind of a comprehensive program.,244,,
1587,0.97,6540.033,6544.07,It would be interesting to know how they've done that.,244,,
1588,0.97,6544.07,6548.074,But that's something we would be interested in helping figure out.,244,,
1589,0.97,6548.074,6553.947,"Do passes have a variable cost to the employer, depending on how many passes they're providing?",245,,
1590,0.97,6553.947,6557.284,Do you get cheaper passes if you have more employees?,245,,
1591,0.97,6557.284,6564.09,So there's a number of ways that employers can provide Transyit benefits--transit benefits.,246,,
1592,0.97,6564.09,6569.095,And the most simple and efficient way is the Orca business passport program that Metro offers.,246,,
1593,0.97,6569.095,6574.467,If you have more than 500 employees on your passport program.,246,,
1594,0.97,6574.467,6579.539,Then Metro actually does custom pricing.,246,,
1595,0.97,6579.539,6583.343,"Where essentially, each employee gets an unlimited Metro pass.",246,,
1596,0.97,6583.343,6588.648,And Metro is adjusting your cost year by year based on the usage of those employees.,246,,
1597,0.97,6588.648,6596.089,So it ends up being cheaper per pass than a retail unlimited pass.,246,,
1598,0.97,6596.089,6604.864,The cost per pass is still cheaper than retail because it's based on kind of the usage in your zone across the passport programs.,246,,
1599,0.97,6604.864,6613.64,"For example, I think for downtown, it's like maybe $800 a year per employee for an unlimited card under the pass port program.",246,,
1600,0.97,6613.64,6617.377,So Maybe some sort of Pass- buying Co-op.,247,,
1601,0.97,6617.377,6619.379,That's what I was wondering.,248,,
1602,0.97,6619.379,6625.518,Like if these B.I.A.S could be a purchaser of the passport program.,248,,
1603,0.97,6625.518,6626.92,Yeah.,249,,
1604,0.97,6626.92,6628.588,Collection of bias or something like that.,250,,
1605,0.97,6628.588,6632.392,So if they get the high employee discount.,250,,
1606,0.97,6632.392,6632.659,Yeah.,251,,
1607,0.97,6632.659,6637.263,"And I think that the challenges to some extent, mostly administrative.",251,,
1608,0.97,6637.263,6642.202,Like there needs to be an entity in these Multiemployer sites to.,251,,
1609,0.97,6642.202,6644.304,Handle the could and distribute the passes to everyone.,251,,
1610,0.97,6644.371,6648.641,Ut it doesn't seem like it should be an insurmountable challenge.,251,,
1611,0.97,6648.641,6659.019,"So as we continue the conversation, it would be also great to hear of any other cities that you think would be good models for us to look at.",252,,
1612,0.97,6659.019,6662.122,And if they haven't been enacted.,252,,
1613,0.97,6662.122,6663.823,What are they considering.,252,,
1614,0.97,6663.823,6665.392,I love Olympia.,252,,
1615,0.97,6665.392,6665.859,That's my hometown.,252,,
1616,0.97,6665.859,6670.23,And when I was asking about which cities have free transit.,252,,
1617,0.97,6670.23,6673.967,I understand that the number of residents in those cities is much smaller.,252,,
1618,0.97,6673.967,6679.706,"But if we can look at comparable city sizes and what other cities are doing that, that would be great.",252,,
1619,0.97,6679.706,6682.342,"And as usual, we're sort of on the cutting edge.",252,,
1620,0.97,6682.342,6682.976,That's also exciting.,252,,
1621,0.97,6682.976,6686.88,And I love these ideas that have already been Brainstormed today.,252,,
1622,0.97,6686.88,6687.547,Any other comment.,252,,
1623,0.97,6687.547,6689.215,So just to reiterate.,253,,
1624,0.97,6689.215,6690.784,This is the beginning of the discussion.,253,,
1625,0.97,6690.784,6695.388,We really wanted to have this from the get go in this Committee for us to get going.,253,,
1626,0.97,6695.388,6710.27,"I know, as I mentioned in the beginning, there's a number of Council members who had past fingerprints with helping expand access to Orca cards and new members who have been advocates of these efforts.",253,,
1627,0.97,6710.27,6716.109,So thanks to our past and new Councilmembers for their ongoing interest in this.,253,,
1628,0.97,6716.109,6720.98,And we will be in touch with you all in terms of when this will come back to our committee.,253,,
1629,0.97,6720.98,6724.25,And I'm sure we'll Brainstorm ideas.,253,,
1630,0.97,6724.25,6738.465,"And to Councilmember Lewis's point, too, I think this is really an economic benefit to many of the business entities, downtown core, making sure workers can show up for the health and welfare of families who need to get to Childcare on time.",253,,
1631,0.97,6738.465,6748.641,"And to reduce overall stress in our community, which we know has physical consequences on our health, by not having reliable and affordable transit options.",253,,
1632,0.97,6748.641,6752.545,We increase stress and Cortisol levels in much of our community.,253,,
1633,0.97,6752.545,6757.25,And we can help address that from a health equity perspective as well.,253,,
1634,0.97,6757.25,6758.051,I'm excited about that.,253,,
1635,0.97,6758.051,6763.923,"I'm going to go ahead and wrap up this item, which is the last item on our agenda, by saying thank you all.",253,,
1636,0.97,6763.923,6770.13,I also want to make sure we give a shout out to Fadetta Quivas.,253,,
1637,0.97,6770.13,6771.397,Who is staff here.,253,,
1638,0.97,6771.397,6774.868,And am be with us all year long.,253,,
1639,0.97,6774.868,6778.404,We'll be sharing our work plan very soon so people can provide us with input.,253,,
1640,0.97,6778.404,6783.076,"And again, our next committee will be another special meeting on Wednesday February 19th.",253,,
1641,0.97,6783.076,6783.676,At 2:00 P.M.,253,,
1642,0.97,6783.676,6787.28,We'll be taking a vote on the capital projects resolution.,253,,
1643,0.97,6787.28,6793.72,"As we discussed today, ideally discussion of business.",253,,
1644,0.97,6793.72,6803.763,"And potentially having a discussion on the future of work, which we began to hear about today, with some of our friends who came from the gig economy and the App-Based work.",253,,
1645,0.97,6803.763,6804.697,So thank you all.,253,,
1646,0.97,6804.697,6806.833,And today's meeting is adjourned.,253,,
1647,0.97,6806.833,6808.101,Thank you.,254,,
