183,0.97,1466.898,1470.001,To meet our climate protection roles we need to begin moving away from fossil fuels.,28,,
184,0.97,1470.001,1476.675,We need to do it in a way that centers the community that could be most affected.,28,,
185,0.97,1476.675,1484.883,So I am really thankful that this study is before you and lays out a clear framework and the next steps for how we work together in the transition.,28,,

195,0.97,1558.69,1568.567,"This includes for example black women, people who are Trans or gender none Binary, people who have experienced homelessness, indigenous people and those with disabilities.",30,,
196,0.97,1568.567,1576.942,Through Participatory budgeting we are building a paradigm for communities centered around those most harmed by violent policing.,30,,

203,0.97,1610.709,1616.147,All electric homes are affordable solutions and necessary for reducing emissions for our environment.,32,,
204,0.97,1616.147,1622.654,We have conducted extensive analysis on single-family homes in a variety of different cities across the United States.,32,,
205,0.97,1622.654,1636.534,"In our 2020 report, the new economics include all electric homes in the Seattle, it is $4500 less in annual cost.",32,,

207,0.97,1642.741,1649.981,"Were San Francisco saves the 5700 up front and over $45,000 over its lifetime.",32,,
208,0.97,1649.981,1658.99,"The reason for the savings is simple, electric heating does not need gas infrastructure inside of it.",32,,
209,0.97,1658.99,1678.109,"In a 2020, Nrdc submitted comments that found that a gas furnace plus and AC system costs 14% more than baseline heat pump.",32,,
210,0.97,1678.109,1691.222,"Additionally, analysis of up Harvard public health study found that burning natural gas in buildings costs the state of Washington $543 million in health costs annually.",32,,
211,0.97,1691.222,1698.129,Seattle has already taken the first step on eliminating most fossil fuels in commercial and large multifamily buildings.,32,,
212,0.97,1698.129,1703.802,Now we need it to bring to the all other buildings.,32,,
213,0.97,1703.802,1704.202,Thank you.,32,,

218,0.97,1736.768,1742.407,I'm calling in to ask the city Councilmember to lift the proviso on the 28 million which is of Tory budgeting.,34,,
219,0.97,1742.407,1753.118,Seattle's PB committee really needs to consist of community members most likely harmed by racist policing and Incarceration.,34,,
220,0.97,1753.118,1766.197,"By providing these living wage salaries, black him indigenous entrance and disability people among others, PB can be held accountable to our most vulnerable residents.",34,,
221,0.97,1766.197,1773.304,And I think it is way past time that we acknowledge that these committees are the real experts for public safety.,34,,
222,0.97,1773.304,1788.086,"If we are going to stay true to the heart and spirit of Participatory budgeting, then it is essential we follow the lead of these committees from the beginning.",34,,
223,0.97,1788.086,1797.929,"It might seem easier for some to follow business and budgeting as usual process, but I'm really asking you to commit to doing your part in making the process itself Antiracist from the beginning and throughout.",34,,

236,0.97,1860.525,1871.636,The reason I'm calling in is to ask you to lift the proviso for the 28 million for Participatory budgeting.,38,,
237,0.97,1871.636,1875.94,As outlined by the amazing lack brilliance research report.,38,,
238,0.97,1875.94,1890.521,Please make sure that Participatory budgeting will be organized by nongovernmental nonprofit and that it is led by a full-time committee that is selected from communities that are most likely to be harmed or killed by systemic racism and violence.,38,,
239,0.97,1890.521,1897.629,We have in the past and continue to spend obscene amounts on policing and Incarceration.,38,,
240,0.97,1897.629,1905.236,It is abundantly clear that this approach does not work to create public safety.,38,,
241,0.97,1905.236,1917.015,The new ideas will emerge from the grassroots of the communities that have the most information for who is being harmed in the way things are currently arranged.,38,,
242,0.97,1917.015,1925.757,This will also get everyone involved and invested in this process of change.,38,,
243,0.97,1925.757,1943.675,Participatory budgeting is a crucial part of what we need to try to create the future Seattle I want to live in where everyone can be safe and flourishing and surrounded by peace and abundance.,38,,
244,0.97,1943.675,1951.282,"Lift the of ISO, led Participatory budgeting proceed and make sure it's led by communities that have been and continue to be most harmed by policing.",38,,

251,0.97,1983.915,1987.018,With the clerk first read item one into the record?,39,,
252,0.97,1987.018,1993.424,"Item one, fossil fuel transition study update, briefing and discussion.",40,,
253,0.97,1993.424,1994.625,Thank you.,41,,
254,0.97,1994.625,2011.943,"So, just to set this up quickly, in 2019 counsel asked to provide an analysis of jobs and wages for those who are directly employed by the fossil fuel industry.",41,,
255,0.97,2011.943,2016.948,And provide a little bit of a forecast of what our original job growth could be in the clean energy sector.,41,,
256,0.97,2016.948,2023.388,So this is really important as we look to reduce and eliminate fossil fuels.,41,,
257,0.97,2023.388,2034.866,We also need to be prepared to get ready for a transition for workers in the Industries as we are building a green economy.,41,,
258,0.97,2034.866,2041.472,We need to make sure folks do not get left behind.,41,,
259,0.97,2041.472,2045.676,I will ask them to focus on the findings and recommendations.,41,,
260,0.97,2045.676,2058.556,"I do want to hear about the methodology as well but really want to get to those findings, in part because we also have a panel to share the discussion with us here.",41,,
261,0.97,2058.556,2065.363,We will be hearing from the office of community development and those who did the research.,41,,
262,0.97,2065.363,2084.682,"We will also be hearing from the Sierra Club, climate solutions, 350 Seattle as well as our labor partners from the Mlk labor Council, the Seattle building trades and Ibew 46.",41,,
263,0.97,2084.682,2104.035,We thought it was important to also hear from workers that will be impacted from these changes everyone that has this in mind that this transition happens in a way that Edwin can thrive and be healthy.,41,,
264,0.97,2104.035,2111.642,So I will hand it over and I will start by introducing the interim director Pamela banks.,41,,
265,0.97,2111.642,2113.611,And I will leave it to you to start.,41,,
266,0.97,2113.611,2114.112,Please go ahead.,41,,
267,0.97,2114.112,2123.955,"Good afternoon, thank you Councilmembers for the opportunity to share our results on the fossil fuel transition study with you today.",42,,
268,0.97,2123.955,2171.002,"We are really excited, it took comes as a great time to see how we can use this study and this job growth industry to help recover from Covid our attributes will provide a detailed overview of the job and they will do it very expeditiously and it's just really important to consider the impacts these jobs have not only on the community but those who have been disproportionately displaced from their jobs we are looking to connect more black and Brown residents to careers in the economy so we can build back better.",42,,
269,0.97,2171.002,2182.58,"Similarly we need to ensure there is access and transitions to clean technology jobs that offer healthy, family wages and sustaining jobs for all residents.",42,,
270,0.97,2182.58,2188.819,We will wrap up the presentation with recommendations for next steps and then open up for comments from our guests.,42,,
271,0.97,2188.819,2201.232,"I'd like to introduce Nancy, the director of our workforce.",42,,
272,0.97,2202.6,2203.334,"Nancy, take it away.",42,,
273,0.97,2203.334,2212.276,"Good afternoon Councilmembers, I know we have a lot to cover so I will move through the slides fairly quickly.",43,,
274,0.97,2212.276,2214.045,I lead the key industries and workforce development.,43,,
275,0.97,2214.045,2220.851,We together after the enclosed recovery strategy that focuses on key sectors.,43,,
276,0.97,2220.851,2231.963,This helps to connect them with residents and youth that need good jobs.,43,,
277,0.97,2231.963,2240.004,"They include green business, Maritime and manufacturing and technology, and then our workforce team also has initiatives to career paths and Healthcare.",43,,
278,0.97,2240.004,2251.916,"These sectors are important because they have growth potential, provide access to family wages sustaining jobs and provide supports to the diversified workforce.",43,,
279,0.97,2251.916,2264.262,We start by assessing and ask what training in terms of diversification.,43,,
280,0.97,2264.262,2278.776,Also the doctors that are changing the nature of the work including automation of certain increasing reliance on Digital competency.,43,,
281,0.97,2278.776,2282.98,With these insights we can begin to build training and advancement strategies to connect more workforce to these careers.,43,,
282,0.97,2282.98,2289.687,So we want to think counsel for supporting this study of the workforce impacts.,43,,
283,0.97,2289.687,2303.601,"As the Presenters will discuss, the study has enabled us to understand more fully the predictions for job growth, clean energy and the decline in fossil fuel related occupations.",43,,
284,0.97,2303.601,2314.345,"Those most impacted by this transition and the current demographic makeup, and so with that I want to turn the presentation over to Stephanie, our business advocate.",43,,
285,0.97,2314.345,2326.657,In the consulting team from community attributes to go over the results of the study.,43,,
286,0.97,2326.657,2335.166,"My job as the green business advocate is to help grow businesses focused on reducing, reversing or repairing climate impacts.",44,,
287,0.97,2335.166,2344.342,And ensuring there is equitable access to good paying jobs.,44,,
288,0.97,2344.342,2353.651,I do this through hearing from businesses to support their unique growth challenges and through programs such as the green business program which recognizes businesses Sustainability efforts and links them to local rebates and incentives.,44,,
289,0.97,2353.651,2372.403,Sharing partner researches on our clean energy resource map we are connecting businesses such as fear solar to opportunities to our career connected learning grant.,44,,
290,0.97,2372.403,2380.511,In 2019 the Council requested an analysis of job wages of those employed in the fossil fuel industry.,44,,
291,0.97,2380.511,2389.42,It forecasted recommendations to implement.,44,,
292,0.97,2389.42,2397.695,We conducted proposals for analysis and selected community attributes as the lead researcher.,44,,
293,0.97,2397.695,2406.337,In the study community agreed to stay Engagedto provide insights from their experiences and bring voices from their Stakeholders and customers.,44,,
294,0.97,2406.337,2411.308,Once we received approval to move forward we finalize that work with community attributes.,44,,
295,0.97,2411.308,2422.553,I will hand it over to the President and Ceo to go over the Methodologies and findings.,44,,
296,0.97,2422.553,2441.639,"Good afternoon Councilmembers, I am the President and Ceo of community attributes and Madalyn will walk you through some of the findings as she did some of the heavy lifting.",45,,
297,0.97,2441.639,2443.407,"As an economist, studies like this come with challenges.",45,,
298,0.97,2443.407,2446.11,So it is agreeing to what is the definition we are talking about.,45,,
299,0.97,2446.11,2456.987,"In the data that economists are able to work with, sometimes they will handle the complexities of the needs.",45,,
300,0.97,2456.987,2466.063,"To that end, we had a lot of input on how to define the industry moving forward using the data that is available.",45,,
301,0.97,2466.063,2477.474,There are a lot of industries that rely on fossil fuels and our rate for conversion to clean energy including that construction industry.,45,,
302,0.97,2477.474,2484.215,They are all a big part of this transition to Transitioning to the green economy.,45,,
303,0.97,2484.215,2492.122,It focused in part on those that are wholly tied to fossil fuels.,45,,
304,0.97,2492.122,2505.503,Which would for sure need to be transferred over to clean energy moving forward.,45,,
305,0.97,2505.503,2525.022,"Definitions are important, so we did some secondary research to learn what other institutions did as well as the definition of clean energy and clean technology and what they were.",45,,
306,0.97,2525.022,2527.658,Massachusetts has done a lot of leading research on this that was helpful.,45,,
307,0.97,2527.658,2537.134,"All of this is necessary for our study, to be able to use existing data to get into how many jobs and occupations are tied to each of those industries.",45,,
308,0.97,2537.134,2543.04,I'm going to turn it over for findings and recommendations.,45,,
309,0.97,2543.04,2551.949,"Good afternoon Councilmembers, and the senior economist for the community attributes.",46,,
310,0.97,2551.949,2554.285,Thank you for the opportunity to present today.,46,,
311,0.97,2554.285,2567.231,"Jumping onto the key findings of the study, as part of this study we looked at the outlook for the clean energy industry and talk to Stakeholders.",46,,
312,0.97,2567.231,2575.105,The Seattle clean energy industry leaders has a strong outlook on job growth.,46,,
313,0.97,2575.105,2588.919,"There is potential for a new clean energy recovery program and policies at the Federal, state and local levels in the coming years that can further strengthen and stabilize the injury industry.",46,,
314,0.97,2588.919,2608.138,"Our data analysis and Metrics for produce to take stock of this fossil fuel and clean energy sectors, it's shown that the King County's job market has a greater number of jobs in the clean energy sector than in fossil fuels.",46,,
315,0.97,2608.138,2617.247,"Also, clean energy jobs are more likely to offer wages greater than the wages of 69,000 for King County.",46,,
316,0.97,2617.247,2627.958,Clean energy Industries move about 11% of jobs with above average wages compared to 8% for the fossil fuel industry.,46,,
317,0.97,2627.958,2646.076,"One other important key finding is as the transition to clean energy accelerates, there is a need for deliberate action to address racial inequities in the workforce.",46,,
318,0.97,2646.076,2659.523,Recommended actions include On- demand site interventions.,46,,
319,0.97,2660.157,2665.095,Stakeholder engagements to support jobs and targeted training interventions for the Upscaling of workers.,46,,
320,0.97,2665.095,2677.474,The transition for fossil fuels will impact the fossil fuel industry differently depending on the transferability of the knowledge and skills.,46,,
321,0.97,2677.474,2695.526,"It can be relatively straightforward, workers can update their skills . for example, automotive service technicians and mechanics will likely require some level of Ev related skills training.",46,,
322,0.97,2695.526,2703.3,"For other occupations, work training will be harder especially when taking into account the impacts of automation.",46,,
323,0.97,2703.3,2714.144,"For example, pipe layers who rely on fossil fuel dependent skills will need job training and transition support.",46,,
324,0.97,2714.144,2727.825,Or specific occupations with transferability of skills and knowledge this research also looked at the impact of Automations on the occupations under consideration in fossil fuel transition.,46,,
325,0.97,2727.825,2751.281,"And specifically found that freight laborers and construction laborers, two operations that are fossil fuel independent, will have the largest percentage of workers of color and where the most impacted by automation in the future.",46,,
326,0.97,2751.281,2765.596,Amongst other findings and Takeaways are an increase in employment in construction and building trades due to an increase Emand of efficiency improvements.,46,,
327,0.97,2765.596,2780.177,"There are also various administrative, legal and financial services, so supporting Admin jobs that are not necessarily linked to the fossil fuel or clean energy sector.",46,,
328,0.97,2780.177,2795.325,So these jobs presumably have skills that are transferable from one sector to another.,46,,
329,0.97,2795.325,2814.711,"As part of this research is conducted, we've reached out to over 300 businesses and organizations in the clean energy in fossil fuel sectors.",46,,
330,0.97,2814.711,2819.616,We did interviews with Stakeholders as well as an Online survey.,46,,
331,0.97,2819.616,2832.262,We received about 49 responses to the survey including 15 minority and women business enterprises.,46,,
332,0.97,2832.262,2845.342,Most of the concerns focused on disruptions to consistent work and the need for a more thorough understanding of the cost that would be Impacting workers.,46,,
333,0.97,2845.342,2858.488,"Some of the themes were around creating and funding transition plans, transitional rules and thinking Multijurisdictional.",46,,
334,0.97,2858.488,2895.325,"From the clean energy sector, companies are facing competition for diverse talent with other industries such as Tech, also tapping into the same talent pool, Seattle clean energy business leaders stressed the importance of the private partnership for infrastructure projects and Decarbonization was considered to be a great opportunities for employment growth moving forward.",46,,
335,0.97,2895.325,2906.837,Finally we brought together all of this analysis into our recommendations.,46,,
336,0.97,2906.837,2909.006,These are grouped into three categories.,46,,
337,0.97,2909.006,2913.243,Priorities to demand the clean energy strategies.,46,,
338,0.97,2913.243,2922.886,They are focused on demand site intervention to support those high employment opportunities.,46,,
339,0.97,2922.886,2937.034,"Strategies include investing in the Carbonized district energy, reaching goes workers to ensure all talent of the clean energy industry.",46,,
340,0.97,2937.034,2942.205,Our second bucket of donations include Stakeholder engagement.,46,,
341,0.97,2942.205,2953.65,That would provide opportunities for immunities mostly impacted and businesses to drive efforts to grow good jobs and minimize job loss.,46,,
342,0.97,2953.65,2965.963,Strategies included here would relate to creating conditions to build skill workforce from local talent pools.,46,,
343,0.97,2965.963,2981.311,Increasing opportunities such as paid Internships and apprenticeship opportunities in the clean energy and creating a displaced fossil fuel worker transition assistant fund for displaced workers.,46,,
344,0.97,2981.311,2987.484,"Finally, business expansion support, targeting clean energy supply strategies.",46,,
345,0.97,2987.484,3010.24,These interventions include the Upscaling of workers through Micro-Credentials and public and private partnerships to create opportunities for disadvantaged workers.,46,,
346,0.97,3010.24,3012.542,Thank you.,46,,
347,0.97,3012.542,3014.845,Thank you.,47,,
348,0.97,3014.845,3018.615,Did somebody want to walk through this slide?,47,,
349,0.97,3018.615,3022.753,I do want to get to the community panel in just a moment.,47,,
350,0.97,3022.753,3026.456,I wanted to close it out really quick.,48,,
351,0.97,3026.456,3055.218,"I just wanted to say that the recovery vision for Seattle is vibrant, innovative adversity and as you just heard it offers an opportunity to create healthy family wages abstaining jobs and capture that opportunity we want to make sure that individuals receive the training and support they need to move into this clean energy career.",48,,
352,0.97,3055.218,3062.592,"Our recovery strategy is to invest in workforce to Veltman related to training, retraining, apprenticeship and retaining programs.",48,,
353,0.97,3062.592,3068.698,And we want to discuss this with our partners to hear what they have to say.,48,,
354,0.97,3068.698,3086.216,We also want to make sure this work is connected to the green new deal Idt and transportation Electrification efforts so that a comprehensive citywide work for strategies implemented with our colleagues across the city.,48,,
355,0.97,3086.216,3094.491,Finally we will need to work with our partners and businesses to make sure these opportunities are equitable and inclusive.,48,,
356,0.97,3094.491,3105.869,We really appreciated the councils support on looking into the strategies and we get forward to getting this underway.,48,,
357,0.97,3105.869,3107.637,I really appreciate this.,49,,
358,0.97,3107.637,3123.253,"We do have a request from Katie, if the panelists can be sent to this Powerpoint.",49,,
359,0.97,3123.253,3124.855,It is probably available on the Council Website.,49,,
360,0.97,3124.855,3133.13,"But I'm happy to send that to you to make sure everybody has access to this as well as the full report you answer some of my questions, but I do see that Councilmember Sawant has a question.",49,,
361,0.97,3133.13,3141.338,"Then I will bring the rest of the panel in, and I've got a few particular questions.",49,,
362,0.97,3141.338,3142.973,"Councilmember Sawant, do you have a question?",49,,
363,0.97,3142.973,3151.248,"Thank you chair, and thank you for the presentation.",50,,
364,0.97,3151.248,3154.417,Maybe my questions will be answered in the coming discussion.,50,,
365,0.97,3154.417,3173.203,I was just wondering if this report was going to present in some sort of concrete analysis on the impact of people's jobs if Seattle passes the bill for that natural gas hookups.,50,,
366,0.97,3173.203,3182.279,"Also, I know people in the labor movement had questions Abou what would be the overall balance of jobs.",50,,
367,0.97,3182.279,3185.515,Are any jobs that would be threatened?,50,,
368,0.97,3185.515,3216.546,"I think it is a fair to be able to ask that question and then answer the question in terms of what other jobs would be created and on balance, can we have sort of a Blossoming of Union jobs in the clean energy sector, what can we do to make transitions so people are guaranteed jobs that are at least as good as the current unionized jobs.",50,,
369,0.97,3216.546,3225.455,And I didn't know if we should expect these in this presentation or if that analysis is forthcoming.,50,,
370,0.97,3225.455,3229.726,Thank you.,50,,
371,0.97,3229.726,3234.231,"Director banks or Kristi, do you want to respond to that?",51,,
372,0.97,3234.231,3241.371,I have a similar list of questions so I do want to bring the panel in.,51,,
373,0.97,3241.371,3246.476,I'm sure we will all be talking about the same thing.,51,,
374,0.97,3246.476,3251.047,"Sure, I appreciate the question Councilmember Sawant.",52,,
375,0.97,3251.047,3258.555,We did not analyze explicitly that policy action in terms of the job impact.,52,,
376,0.97,3258.555,3274.17,"I do believe with home construction and contractors in general, there are some very specific occupations that the team found that we will need retraining for new opportunities.",52,,
377,0.97,3274.17,3284.414,Pipefitters is a good example of one where that natural gas Pipefitting is just a skill set would be in less demand.,52,,
378,0.97,3284.414,3296.593,"It's not to say those individuals don't have transferable skills, they probably do, they will just probably have some retraining that will be necessary to meet those needs.",52,,
379,0.97,3296.593,3301.131,"There are examples in clean technology, such as heat pumps for example.",52,,
380,0.97,3301.131,3308.338,This might be too will lower demand and quantity of those workers.,52,,
381,0.97,3308.338,3322.052,"So as the Industries migrate and turnover within each industry and application from fossil fuels to clean technology, there are undoubtedly some retraining that will be necessary as a part of that.",52,,
382,0.97,3322.052,3332.796,"And all the trades for the labor unions that help organize those, they will certainly be engaged as part of that as the transformation happens.",52,,
383,0.97,3332.796,3335.865,But the apprenticeship will be focused on the technology.,52,,
384,0.97,3335.865,3347.344,"I expected to be as much driven by demand, especially in the Seattle markets, as much as policies.",52,,
385,0.97,3347.344,3354.484,"So hopefully between the two forces, of vibrant conversion can happen.",52,,
386,0.97,3354.484,3359.689,"Can we take the presentation down, I like to bring the rest of the folks in.",53,,
387,0.97,3359.689,3374.904,"And just go ahead and ask the labor Council, maybe I can just ask our labor partners to maybe respond to the questions, and your reactions to the report.",53,,
388,0.97,3374.904,3384.013,I'd be interested to hear your thoughts about how your sector might be affected by this.,53,,
389,0.97,3384.013,3394.09,I will jump in.,54,,
390,0.97,3394.09,3397.994,Thank you for putting this together.,55,,
391,0.97,3397.994,3403.933,"Obviously the building trade here in Seattle, my local just turned 125 years old.",55,,
392,0.97,3403.933,3408.037,Most of us have been operating for over a century in Seattle.,55,,
393,0.97,3408.037,3412.742,We have seen every kind of transition that can happen in a major city.,55,,
394,0.97,3412.742,3418.715,Can you imagine what the mechanical systems and things look like 100 years ago.,55,,
395,0.97,3418.715,3421.418,This is nothing new to us.,55,,
396,0.97,3421.418,3424.287,Transition to new technology.,55,,
397,0.97,3424.287,3428.558,Some of the things that worry me a little bit.,55,,
398,0.97,3428.558,3431.427,I'm about family wages and benefits.,55,,
399,0.97,3431.427,3437.767,"Not only wages, but benefits.",55,,
400,0.97,3437.767,3445.642,We want people to be able to retire with dignity and live in the home they were able to afford when they were working in the field by the hours.,55,,
401,0.97,3445.642,3450.246,"So my job is easy, I just get to concentrate on working-class families and opportunity.",55,,
402,0.97,3450.246,3462.659,"So around this, I always have concern, like in 2008 and 2009, we had this huge influx of money.",55,,
403,0.97,3462.659,3472.202,"And all of a sudden, whenever you see a pile of money, easy people kind of come, and a lot of these training programs popped up.",55,,
404,0.97,3472.202,3478.308,We are going to teach the Caulking of windows or heat pumps or solar.,55,,
405,0.97,3478.308,3482.579,When building trades already do that through the state approved apprenticeship programs.,55,,
406,0.97,3482.579,3494.691,So we had a lot of young men and women being taught something that was not transferable to an apprenticeship or long-term job.,55,,
407,0.97,3494.691,3506.636,"The Underserved communities, once you, you can only fool people so many times before they lose the ability to believe you anymore.",55,,
408,0.97,3506.636,3519.716,"And I saw hundreds of people come back to the building trades, kids who had gone through these five, eight, 12 week programs, with no certification or no job.",55,,
409,0.97,3519.716,3523.786,And the ones that were offered were $15 an hour with no benefits.,55,,
410,0.97,3523.786,3532.662,"So I think as we see this we will see a lot of people thinking all, it's this new technology.",55,,
411,0.97,3532.662,3534.063,Well it is not really new to us.,55,,
412,0.97,3534.063,3534.664,We do that.,55,,
413,0.97,3534.664,3537.166,"Everything that is done the building trade, we do.",55,,
414,0.97,3537.166,3543.539,I would press anybody to show me something we are not already training for with good family jobs.,55,,
415,0.97,3543.539,3550.246,So I want to make everybody aware.,55,,
416,0.97,3550.246,3553.383,"If somebody's got this new thing that only they can teach and is proprietary, be careful.",55,,
417,0.97,3553.383,3554.784,We can do it all.,55,,
418,0.97,3554.784,3559.155,"Keith, did you want to Chime in?",56,,
419,0.97,3559.155,3563.693,"Yes, pretty much echoing what Monty said.",57,,
420,0.97,3563.693,3574.203,"Echoing, the Red flag, we have the building trades and I'm licensed craft and they do a five-year corporate ship to obtain a license.",57,,
421,0.97,3574.203,3581.844,"I sit on a Pre-Apprenticeship now, work in concert with of those programs.",57,,
422,0.97,3581.844,3591.921,"But they actually offer Wraparound support services and get folks into living wage, not jobs, careers.",57,,
423,0.97,3591.921,3595.024,I hear the J word all the time and it kind of upsets me.,57,,
424,0.97,3595.024,3597.026,My career field is not a job.,57,,
425,0.97,3597.026,3607.136,"We come to meetings, we will have the building being built and folks come in and say those are all temporary jobs.",57,,
426,0.97,3607.136,3619.449,"No, it is a career filled with temporary jobs that pay above apprentice wages, a $69,000 a year median income.",57,,
427,0.97,3619.449,3626.99,"So a little raw, that the whole Rfa funding piece did not go as expected.",57,,
428,0.97,3626.99,3644.774,"He tried our best, but for all the money that flowed, you tell me what we got for her and I don't think we got the biggest bang for the buck we could have, we have the Biden administration pushing the plan that is coming now, hopefully we will get it.",57,,
429,0.97,3644.774,3647.477,But we need to be a lot smarter and we could actually work.,57,,
430,0.97,3647.477,3652.048,"That last piece, the piece about solar wind came out of that.",57,,
431,0.97,3652.048,3656.753,"Well, in the Union sector, we don't own that market.",57,,
432,0.97,3656.753,3659.222,"Shame on us, should have tried harder.",57,,
433,0.97,3659.222,3664.694,But a lot of those jobs are not good paying jobs in that industry regardless of what you hear.,57,,
434,0.97,3664.694,3672.301,"They are not Union wage jobs, they are not prevailed, so a little bit of a misnomer there.",57,,
435,0.97,3672.301,3677.607,Sorry if I'm sounding a little Grouchy but I'm about evil getting true equity.,57,,
436,0.97,3677.607,3684.313,"I'm happy to take people in, get them for five years, they get a license.",57,,
437,0.97,3684.313,3685.882,They can grow a business after that.,57,,
438,0.97,3685.882,3699.328,"I'm not blowing smoke up anybody's tent, I want people to have a real, living wage career where they can supply for themselves, their community and family members.",57,,
439,0.97,3699.328,3704.701,You think I'd be the happiest person in the world dancing circles because Electrification.,57,,
440,0.97,3704.701,3713.142,"It will be a lot of work for my Úmembers, thank you very much.",57,,
441,0.97,3713.142,3717.28,We will step up and offer folks the opportunity to come into the industry and train folks to that standard.,57,,
442,0.97,3717.28,3721.117,"However, I'm also not going to leave my brothers and sisters in the fossil fuel industry behind either.",57,,
443,0.97,3721.117,3727.957,I have Ibew members that work in the gas industry.,57,,
444,0.97,3727.957,3735.031,I want to say this to you as the interim director of economic development.,58,,
445,0.97,3735.031,3744.44,"I'm not really new to this game with unions, my dad was out long-haul truck driver.",58,,
446,0.97,3744.44,3747.11,That is a career and I appreciate you correcting this on that language.,58,,
447,0.97,3747.11,3751.247,"As a director, any money that Oed gets will go to Y'all.",58,,
448,0.97,3751.247,3764.594,I don't believe putting people through Pre-Apprenticeship training so then they sit on a bench for a year or two years if they can come straight to the Union.,58,,
449,0.97,3764.594,3773.803,"My commitment to you all and to that unions, I was a union member forever until getting into management, is to support what you have going on.",58,,
450,0.97,3773.803,3776.305,And these are careers.,58,,
451,0.97,3776.305,3798.928,"And a lot of the work I do, especially in LAC and Brown communities, you don't need a college degree, putting all these people through college and getting into debt to get into the work and Pancreas that Y'all have.",58,,
452,0.97,3798.928,3801.197,"We are looking to you, you are our partners in this.",58,,
453,0.97,3801.197,3810.006,"It's not just giving money to some agency, I'd rather go straight to the union's and work through organizations, people who have connections with you all.",58,,
454,0.97,3810.006,3825.454,To make I want to bring Britney and depart in to get your perspective on the report itself and really just this broader issue of how we mitigate.,58,,
455,0.97,3825.454,3836.566,If you think there are ways that we should be mitigating and laying the groundwork that really supports workers and addresses the broader clean energy issues we are looking at.,58,,
456,0.97,3836.566,3839.368,"So, your reactions?",58,,
457,0.97,3839.368,3847.577,I'd actually like to refer to Jessica on this.,59,,
458,0.97,3847.577,3852.281,Thank you all the folks that worked on this report.,60,,
459,0.97,3852.281,3858.421,It was really tremendous of you to come together and I love how this conversation is starting out with a very explicit understanding.,60,,
460,0.97,3858.421,3869.699,"When we are talking about the opportunities in a clean energy economy, let's talk about what ill take care of Pe that feels so important as a resident.",60,,
461,0.97,3869.699,3872.602,There I am at Resonating.,60,,
462,0.97,3872.602,3881.878,"I am an Organizer with 350 Seattle and the grass use climate group with almost 10,000 members in Seattle and King County.",60,,
463,0.97,3881.878,3896.225,We Co-Launched the Greendale campaign and have since then been proud to work in the coalition and community members to transition holders like Seattle.,60,,
464,0.97,3896.225,3901.731,We began exploring how to transition our homes back from fossil fuels back in 2019.,60,,
465,0.97,3901.731,3919.548,"We got some are is working with Councilmembers to introduce a policy, and heard some really valid feedback from folks on this call that there was a lot more work to help understand how workers would be impacted.",60,,
466,0.97,3919.548,3934.563,So we pause the policy discussions and then worked with leaders at the Mlk labor Council and a lot of Councilmembers here to win funding for the 2020 budget.,60,,
467,0.97,3934.563,3939.101,"So quick reaction, I want to make sure might produce a Timeshare.",60,,
468,0.97,3939.101,3941.604,This is a really great time to be having these conversations.,60,,
469,0.97,3941.604,3954.55,"The report and oversight community coming Online, this is the time to take action there homes and buildings off of fossil fuels.",60,,
470,0.97,3954.55,3972.802,"Also, as you heard in the comments, it is also essential and as the clean economy grows, all these new job careers will be good, living wage careers accessible to all.",60,,
471,0.97,3972.802,3979.976,So we are just really excited to see how this will equitably ring in the transition.,60,,
472,0.97,3979.976,4002.298,And we are really looking forward to working with the city and labor partners on how to implement them to equitably phase out fossil fuels and builds a clean energy future for all.,60,,
473,0.97,4002.298,4003.699,"Depa, I will hand it over to you.",60,,
474,0.97,4003.699,4031.861,"First of all, thank you for having me, I'm the policy manager at climate solutions, which is a local nonprofit working to accelerate clean energy solutions in the Northwest and I want to start off by framing this issue as one of public health, racial justice, economic justice and climate mitigation.",61,,
475,0.97,4031.861,4046.776,"There is no question that we need to start to phase out fossil fuels, which Seattle has already committed to.",61,,
476,0.97,4046.776,4067.296,"There are enormous health impacts from the use of particularly gas, but also oil and buildings, putting into her air quality concerns . and so we are coming from a place of really wanting to collaborate with everyone here.",61,,
477,0.97,4067.296,4079.575,To make sure these solutions are equitable and include just transitions.,61,,
478,0.97,4079.575,4083.479,"At the baseline is that we need to stop using fossil fuels, there is no way around it.",61,,
479,0.97,4083.479,4085.881,We are really pleased Seattle has already gone work on this transition.,61,,
480,0.97,4085.881,4094.557,We are thrilled that they adopted a strong energy code earlier this year that eliminated most fossil fuels in New Marshall and large multifamily buildings.,61,,
481,0.97,4094.557,4109.939,"That was a great first step but we need to make sure all other buildings are also brought up to speed so that the people use those buildings which include tenants, homeowners and workers, pretty much everyone in the city, that those folks at the same health and safety protections.",61,,
482,0.97,4109.939,4119.415,And we know this movement is happening already.,61,,
483,0.97,4119.415,4123.352,Seattle schools has already recently made commitments to stop using fossil fuels in their buildings.,61,,
484,0.97,4123.352,4136.532,"So, we would really love to get started with everyone here in developing policies while also incorporating their recommendations into the reports.",61,,
485,0.97,4136.532,4145.774,"I'm very excited about some of the demand sites that we touched on in the presentation, which hopefully can create a path towards clean energy careers are the workers who could be most impacted.",61,,
486,0.97,4145.774,4157.086,"For example, we'd love to work with you all on investing in the Carbonized cleaning systems, which means Pressurized pipes, providing on cold water to buildings.",61,,
487,0.97,4157.086,4161.59,There are also examples from other cities that have a past policies.,61,,
488,0.97,4161.59,4173.168,"For example, San Francisco paired their building with installing Stormwater infrastructure.",61,,
489,0.97,4173.168,4189.351,"We also proudly support recommendations for community scaled Decarbonization, targeting neighborhoods as a whole as a plan to move from fossil fuels.",61,,
490,0.97,4189.351,4200.829,"I also want to emphasize that any Decarbonization efforts, especially for existing buildings, need to be paired with strong Anti-Displacement policies.",61,,
491,0.97,4200.829,4213.709,It the communities that face the biggest health burdens from L air pollution should be able to even clean and safe homes but also not worry about being priced out.,61,,
492,0.97,4213.709,4215.511,In that same principle holds true for affordable housing.,61,,
493,0.97,4215.511,4223.552,I will stop there and let brief Britney speak a little as well.,61,,
494,0.97,4223.552,4230.459,But we do like to see this report and see that there are Conch create solutions and steps that have been identified.,61,,
495,0.97,4230.459,4235.464,Thank you Depa.,62,,
496,0.97,4235.464,4236.532,Thank you Depa.,63,,
497,0.97,4236.532,4238.567,I'm excited to be here.,63,,
498,0.97,4238.567,4242.338,My name is Brittany and I'm chair of the Seattle group Sierra Club.,63,,
499,0.97,4242.338,4247.276,It is a volunteer led organization working across the United States and Canada.,63,,
500,0.97,4247.276,4254.483,And we are working hard on building Electrification locally and nationwide.,63,,
501,0.97,4254.483,4258.988,We know it is an area in getting big results in improving health and the climate.,63,,
502,0.97,4258.988,4278.007,"I like to talk really quick about why we need to act on buildings, just to emphasize, a report from the United Nations clearly States that expanding the use of natural gas is just incompatible with the climate agreement and keeping global warming to 1.25 degrees Celsius.",63,,
503,0.97,4278.007,4290.519,"Another report shows that meeting the Biden administration's National target of cutting climate pollution 50% by 2030, means all new buildings must be all electric by 2025.",63,,
504,0.97,4290.519,4293.789,"So, it is clear that the urgency is they are.",63,,
505,0.97,4293.789,4301.13,"But, while the transition to clean and transition to electric buildings is exciting, how we go about it is important to.",63,,
506,0.97,4301.13,4325.954,That's why we encourage and support the study and are really excited to have data to help us move forward in line with our principles including ensuring our workers are taken care of.,63,,
507,0.97,4325.954,4329.858,We know and see from the study that some workers will need help Transitioning into new jobs and careers.,63,,
508,0.97,4329.858,4331.76,"Specifically good pain, secured Union jobs with good benefits.",63,,
509,0.97,4331.76,4338.0,"We are really ready to back policies that aid this, including not only job training and placement, but Childcare and financial incentives and assistance, too.",63,,
510,0.97,4338.0,4347.943,We also know that further community engagement needs to be done as we shape specific Electrification of policies.,63,,
511,0.97,4347.943,4355.818,Especially for communities hit hardest by climate change in Covid-19.,63,,
512,0.97,4355.818,4358.287,I also want to point out that there is a huge overlap here.,63,,
513,0.97,4358.287,4366.195,The report indicates that workers who are members of the communities are also most likely to benefit from the transition support.,63,,
514,0.97,4366.195,4378.907,"This outreach and support work cannot be separate from the climate work, it is all the same thing, it is just that we are all here to make sure everyone can thrive.",63,,
515,0.97,4378.907,4390.219,"So, from cities in California to across the country all are making sure their buildings are built safe and fossil fuel free.",63,,
516,0.97,4390.219,4399.528,"And so to level up the work, I'm excited we can take the data from this report and all work together to model a truly equitable process.",63,,
517,0.97,4399.528,4408.537,It can be used to prove the lives of everyone in Seattle but also inspire other communities as they move forward.,63,,
518,0.97,4408.537,4412.641,I think you all for your partnership.,63,,
519,0.97,4412.641,4420.015,I do want to mention that Puget sound was intending to be here.,64,,
520,0.97,4420.015,4430.092,She had an event come up and she was not able to make it area but I really want to thank her because she's been an integral part of all of these conversations.,64,,
521,0.97,4430.092,4436.431,I think I am going to leave it to you Katie to have the last word here.,64,,
522,0.97,4436.431,4438.734,We do need to move on to our next agenda item.,64,,
523,0.97,4438.734,4445.307,But I wanted to give you a chance to bring it home for us today.,64,,
524,0.97,4445.307,4446.909,"Awesome, thank you for the opportunity.",65,,
525,0.97,4446.909,4457.686,I'm at the deputy director and also of number of the laborers local 242 here in King County.,65,,
526,0.97,4457.686,4471.767,"And I think that, what I have learned from doing this kind of work, this transition work, is that the devil really is in the details.",65,,
527,0.97,4471.767,4490.319,"But, the work of making, the work of Transitioning to a cleaner economy really is about meticulous analysis of who will be harmed and what lies on the other side.",65,,
528,0.97,4490.319,4494.723,I love that just told the story of how we got here.,65,,
529,0.97,4494.723,4506.034,"It was rooted in a saying okay if we are going to change the rules and how natural gas is used in Seattle, then we need to understand exactly who will be harmed.",65,,
530,0.97,4506.034,4515.41,"I heard Councilmember Sawant say Hey, can we really drill down on that and who are we talking about, with what policy, and what will happen and how much will it cost.",65,,
531,0.97,4515.41,4536.832,"I think that the vision that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in her great new deal at the national level, is rooted in a commitment to keeping workers all with wage and benefit parity during and at the end of transition.",65,,
532,0.97,4536.832,4543.205,"And frankly, that is a lot of money.",65,,
533,0.97,4543.205,4546.708,"So, but it is possible and requires some regulatory changes.",65,,
534,0.97,4546.708,4553.982,"Anything so long as there is a good faith commitment from our elected leaders in environmental partners, I think we can get there together.",65,,
535,0.97,4553.982,4560.422,I just really want to appreciate that it feels like we are all trying to get there together.,65,,
536,0.97,4560.422,4578.674,"I'm looking forward to seeing what the concrete next steps are on policy and for worker retraining plans for the folks we've identified as being in need of those services, because there is lots of work we can do together.",65,,
537,0.97,4578.674,4582.678,"Thank you all, I see that Monty has left a comment.",66,,
538,0.97,4582.678,4588.817,We do want to make sure that they are there as well.,66,,
539,0.97,4588.817,4594.289,Leah was a big part of the conversation.,66,,
540,0.97,4594.289,4600.395,So we could have these very specific questions answered.,66,,
541,0.97,4600.395,4625.454,"So, I look forward to continuing this conversation and to really putting our heads together to figure out how we can move forward in a way that ensures that we are having clean buildings, clean communities, healthy neighbors, workers that continue to have good paying careers with benefits, all along the way.",66,,
542,0.97,4625.454,4632.661,"And, the question of how much this will all cost us, that is something I look forward to talking about, too.",66,,
543,0.97,4632.661,4637.632,Because I do think that will be a big part of our conversation about how we invest to make sure this happens.,66,,
544,0.97,4637.632,4643.372,So thank you all of you for being here and we look forward to continuing the conversation.,66,,
545,0.97,4643.372,4654.182,"Let's move to the next item, Lakecia will you please read item two into the record.",66,,
546,0.97,4654.182,4657.619,"Budget update, briefing and discussion.",67,,
547,0.97,4657.619,4662.29,Thank you so much.,68,,
548,0.97,4662.29,4664.626,"Okay, we are going to move on to the Participatory budgeting.",68,,
549,0.97,4664.626,4671.366,I do want to sort of set the background again for this conversation.,68,,
550,0.97,4671.366,4690.585,"In the wake of George Floyd's murder last year, we heard from community members, particularly like to run community members about the need for deep, systemic change in all kinds of systems and how the city runs, especially how we allocate resources for community safety.",68,,
551,0.97,4690.585,4708.036,One proposal we unanimously supported was a Participatory budget Processthat would allow our neighbors to vote on how to allocate some portion of city resources so that folks in our communities could have a say in how we share power and resources in the city.,68,,
552,0.97,4708.036,4716.545,"This isn't just about trying to reform the police Department, which is something we've been working on for a long time.",68,,
553,0.97,4716.545,4729.157,This is really about a reallocation of public dollars and investing in a way that reverses generations of policies.,68,,
554,0.97,4729.157,4742.604,I believe as a counsel that we have a moral imperative to begin dismantling the existing power structures that are rooted in Anti-Blackness and really find new ways to share power and decision-making.,68,,
555,0.97,4742.604,4749.044,I think Participatory budgeting is an important first step in that direction and really eager to keep this policy moving forward so we can get the money out the door.,68,,
556,0.97,4749.044,4757.752,"So, today we will hear first from the Council central staff that will walk us through the draft legislation.",68,,
557,0.97,4757.752,4770.732,Then I'm excited to have guests here today that will talk about the potential for Participatory budgeting to help change community conditions that can lead to better community safety for everyone.,68,,
558,0.97,4770.732,4773.301,"So Amy, I will hand it off to you to get us started.",68,,
559,0.97,4773.301,4777.372,Thank you.,69,,
560,0.97,4777.372,4793.188,"My name is Amy from the Council central staff . Today I want to provide a brief background on Participatory budgeting and the initiative, given overview of legislation and provide some policy considerations.",69,,
561,0.97,4793.188,4819.381,"As you know, the Council has been working toward establishing a new Participatory budgeting program since the summer of 2020 after significant advocacy efforts funded $3 million to a community research project to conduct a needs assessment and road map for a process that is intended to improve public safety, particularly for those most impacted by racism and policing.",69,,
562,0.97,4819.381,4843.972,"The Council appropriated $20.3 million in the 2021 adopted budget including funding for Community-Based organizations to run the process, the social services triage system App and also investments in the project and programs to be recommended by the Participatory budgeting process.",69,,
563,0.97,4843.972,4849.578,They are currently held under proviso.,69,,
564,0.97,4849.578,4856.618,In November the Council entered into a contract with the freedom project to conduct the black brilliance research project.,69,,
565,0.97,4856.618,4870.332,The project team conducted extensive research on community safety and needs which provided the basis for the team's recommendations of the Participatory budgeting program.,69,,
566,0.97,4870.332,4882.877,"It identified community needs to support participation in the program, a framework for an equitable process and recommended priority investment areas that were discussed Deviously in presentations.",69,,
567,0.97,4882.877,4890.685,Since then the executive has worked with the black brilliance research team to develop a program pending plan based on recommendations.,69,,
568,0.97,4890.685,4897.926,On March 30th the executive provided a memo with two approaches to the participating program.,69,,
569,0.97,4897.926,4904.599,They are included in the attachment for today's agenda.,69,,
570,0.97,4904.599,4905.4,I will briefly describe them.,69,,
571,0.97,4905.4,4915.343,The executives first proposed option would authorize the Department of neighborhoods to issue a request for proposal for a third party to administer the Participatory budgeting program.,69,,
572,0.97,4915.343,4929.457,"They estimate it will cost 7.5 million, negotiate the contract and get the third party time to hire staff before the Participatory budgeting program can begin.",69,,
573,0.97,4929.457,4944.506,"The third-party administered will be responsible for hiring and managing the committee recommended by the research project, providing technical support and expertise and managing funds to reduce barriers to participation such as Digital equity initiatives.",69,,
574,0.97,4944.506,4956.384,"This option also included $375,000 for the Department of neighborhood staff to provide administrative data, and logistical support as requested.",69,,
575,0.97,4956.384,4967.896,The second proposed option would authorize the Department of neighborhoods to run the Participatory budgeting program including hiring 15 independent contractors to form the program committee.,69,,
576,0.97,4967.896,4979.541,This was estimated to cost 2.6 million and would take 3 to 4 months before the program could begin.,69,,
577,0.97,4979.541,4985.413,"Under both options, the Participatory budgeting program would take 6 to 10 months after the initial setup described in the two options.",69,,
578,0.97,4985.413,4989.984,The draft legislation is included in today's agenda.,69,,
579,0.97,4989.984,4997.559,It is intended to move the process forward but does differ from the options proposed by the executive which I will highlight.,69,,
580,0.97,4997.559,5006.601,"First, the legislation would lift the proviso proposed by the Council on approximately $18 million in finance.",69,,
581,0.97,5006.601,5014.943,This is only a portion of the Participatory budgeting funds and the remainder would stay under the original advisers.,69,,
582,0.97,5014.943,5029.29,It would create three new positions for the Seattle office of civil rights to work with the community to request a proposal to select a third party administrator to manage the contract and staff the Participatory budgeting program.,69,,
583,0.97,5029.29,5038.666,Which would include coordinating internal city staff and external partners in support of the program.,69,,
584,0.97,5038.666,5040.568,They would appropriate funds to support these positions.,69,,
585,0.97,5040.568,5052.781,"Because the Participatory budgeting is one time rather than ongoing, the legislation appropriate funding for these positions through 2023.",69,,
586,0.97,5052.781,5061.122,"It also includes $15,000 to support community participation in the selection of the third- party provider.",69,,
587,0.97,5061.122,5070.064,The legislation also has two new advisers.,69,,
588,0.97,5070.064,5091.186,"Finally, the legislation includes a ratifying the confirm class which would allow work to begin before becoming effective.",69,,
589,0.97,5091.186,5093.321,So they can begin raiding job descriptions and things like that.,69,,
590,0.97,5093.321,5094.923,That concludes the basis of the legislation.,69,,
591,0.97,5094.923,5115.977,"I do have a few policy considerations I like to highlight area as I mentioned, the proposed legislation creates authority for three new positions and funds the positions with one-time funds sufficient, and to continue beyond 2033 they will need to identify another funding source.",69,,
592,0.97,5115.977,5125.153,"Second, the legislation funds the development and issuance for a third party administrator as well as the Department staff to manage the contract and support for the program.",69,,
593,0.97,5125.153,5130.892,But it does not fund the contract with the third-party administrator.,69,,
594,0.97,5130.892,5138.266,It assumes that the Council will make future appropriations to support the contract once a third party Ministry there is selected.,69,,
595,0.97,5138.266,5154.082,"Legislation would commit the funds, sorry, yes, commit the funds to Soc are witches consistent with the recommendation made by the black brilliance research project team rather than the Department of neighborhoods as the executive propose.",69,,
596,0.97,5154.082,5166.728,This would be an expansion of the duties and can build off the collaborative Grantmaking work that was used to develop the community alternatives to Incarceration and police request proposals previously.,69,,
597,0.97,5166.728,5175.703,"This would have no effect on that your voice, your choice program.",69,,
598,0.97,5175.703,5182.076,The Council's original intent was that this program would occur in 2021.,69,,
599,0.97,5182.076,5197.192,"However, as demonstrated by the Council, the process will likely take several months, meaning that the actual program will not begin until the end of 2021 with the bulk of the program being conducted in 2022.",69,,
600,0.97,5197.192,5218.212,"Deputy Mayor Washington's March 30th letter suggested that the Council addressed the issues that include racial and social justice situations, third-party administrator Payee and limitations on voting and eligibility.",69,,
601,0.97,5218.212,5232.594,"The legislation does not address these issues specifically, instead it depends on the community Stakeholders and organizations responding to ensure that the proposed programs considers and adjust them appropriately.",69,,
602,0.97,5232.594,5242.604,I also wanted to raise the fact that the Rfp does require additional time and resources from organizations to prepare proposals.,69,,
603,0.97,5242.604,5252.18,"The legislation would provide an additional 15,000 to support community participation in the development of the Rfp and create a more equitable Rfp process.",69,,
604,0.97,5252.18,5262.156,It could also include technical support identified in the community.,69,,
605,0.97,5262.156,5278.873,"And as I mentioned, the funding provided by counsel anticipates funding, a civilian crisis response and is not fund that and would require future Council action to fund the project.",69,,
606,0.97,5278.873,5293.521,That includes the policy that I would highlight in this legislation and I'm happy to answer any questions.,69,,
607,0.97,5293.521,5309.804,I don't have any particular questions right now but I will see if my colleagues have any questions . I will see if my colleagues have any questions for Amy before moving to our guests.,69,,
608,0.97,5309.804,5312.64,"I'm not seeing, all, Councilmember Herbold.",69,,
609,0.97,5312.64,5332.026,"Can you walk through the implications of not acting on the recommendations, not the recommendations, but not amending the proviso in a way that addresses the request for the development of an App.",70,,
610,0.97,5332.026,5345.239,"But I think I heard you say, there is a proviso on those dollars now with the expectation that some dollars would be used to develop the App.",70,,
611,0.97,5345.239,5349.277,The proposal we had before us include that expectation.,70,,
612,0.97,5349.277,5361.289,"And so, if we just move forward and did nothing, it would be that Perfecto, correct?",70,,
613,0.97,5361.289,5384.912,"I think that expectation at least in terms of the language is still there, I think for the Department staff that had been working on that, nobody has rushed forward to claim responsibility for the development of the App or finding that portion of this.",71,,
614,0.97,5384.912,5396.324,"So I think it would require a little bit more work to find the appropriate home, scope and budget for that.",71,,
615,0.97,5396.324,5399.827,"So if counsel did want to move forward, it could be included in this piece of legislation.",71,,
616,0.97,5399.827,5411.739,"I could be included in a separate, independent piece of legislation or Council could choose to fund the development of an App only if it's chosen as a project through the Participatory budget process.",71,,
617,0.97,5411.739,5423.651,It was similar to what was described in the black brilliance research project as one of the potential types of projects that could be developed and funded through Participatory budgeting.,71,,
618,0.97,5423.651,5426.954,So that is a choice that the Council can pick.,71,,
619,0.97,5426.954,5448.075,"And I'm just remembering a $50,000 allocation for the development of a new crisis response.",72,,
620,0.97,5448.075,5452.78,There are a lot of moving pieces where many of us are participating in the city spring.,72,,
621,0.97,5452.78,5465.159,"I'm just wondering if there might be an opportunity to discuss the $50,000.",72,,
622,0.97,5465.159,5472.5,"It was not, even though it was allocated for that purpose in the budget process, there was a budget error and it was not transferred over to Hst.",72,,
623,0.97,5472.5,5477.004,So they are not currently working on that element.,72,,
624,0.97,5477.004,5488.416,"But if there is a funding need and the Stakeholder ring shows there is still a need, that might be a source of funding we would want to consider.",72,,
625,0.97,5488.416,5497.091,That sounds very much in line with the original intent of that.,73,,
626,0.97,5497.091,5507.435,Let us move on.,74,,
627,0.97,5508.502,5511.506,I am very excited to have two guests here today to talk about this process.,74,,
628,0.97,5511.506,5518.713,We have invited the New York City Council member who represents district 38 in New York City.,74,,
629,0.97,5518.713,5522.783,They have 51 city Councilmembers there.,74,,
630,0.97,5522.783,5528.055,So imagine what their central staff must go through.,74,,
631,0.97,5528.055,5540.468,So district 38 has produced the highest number of PB voters citywide and welcomed voting regardless of migration status.,74,,
632,0.97,5540.468,5542.537,They had middle school students participate in the process.,74,,
633,0.97,5542.537,5546.44,So I'm excited to hear from the Councilmember about how things work in New York.,74,,
634,0.97,5546.44,5560.922,We also have the executive director of choose 180 which is an organization that partners with institutional leaders to connect young people to opportunity.,74,,
635,0.97,5560.922,5569.063,To empower them with choice and teach them skills necessary to avoid engagement with the criminal legal system.,74,,
636,0.97,5569.063,5573.935,So thank you so much for being here.,74,,
637,0.97,5573.935,5582.977,I wanted to ask you both to just sort of share with us your perspective as you think about purchase of a Tory budgeting.,74,,
638,0.97,5582.977,5596.924,One of our goals for Participatory budgeting is that it be a tool for community development.,74,,
639,0.97,5596.924,5599.927,"It really fosters civic engagement, fosters better relationship between the community and the city.",74,,
640,0.97,5599.927,5608.436,And that we build capacity and resilience in our communities.,74,,
641,0.97,5608.436,5614.642,"So we are thinking about, in order to achieve those goals, what kind of short-term and long-term measures of success we might have.",74,,
642,0.97,5614.642,5623.451,So I will just put that out there is a broad Questio but would also love to hear from you about a little bit of your experience in New York.,74,,
643,0.97,5623.451,5633.527,Thank you to all of you Councilmember's on this committee today.,75,,
644,0.97,5633.527,5647.742,"As of fellow Councilmember I just want to say how much I've been enjoying this public hearing, listening to the initial voices on the ground and really walking through how you do your work.",75,,
645,0.97,5647.742,5659.72,Amy's presentation about the kind of technical components really show that you've all been thinking really long and hard about this initiative.,75,,
646,0.97,5659.72,5670.164,"Someone who is now seven years deep into Participatory budgeting in the district, as Councilmember Morales said, we are really thrilled with the response from our community.",75,,
647,0.97,5670.164,5675.069,"I've got to tell you coming you are on your way, you are in the right direction.",75,,
648,0.97,5675.069,5678.773,The compass is pointing North.,75,,
649,0.97,5678.773,5681.442,I'm just here to say take that leap.,75,,
650,0.97,5681.442,5689.717,I will talk to you a little bit about what we've seen in the leap we've taken in New York City.,75,,
651,0.97,5689.717,5691.652,First I want to talk about the District itself.,75,,
652,0.97,5691.652,5700.561,"With the highest participation we have, over 50% of residents who were living, some 200,000 people in our district are Foreign-Born.",75,,
653,0.97,5700.561,5711.405,"They are not speaking English at home, they are speaking another language, Arabic, Chinese, three different dialects, Spanish and English.",75,,
654,0.97,5711.405,5717.645,We have the second largest public housing development in the city of New York.,75,,
655,0.97,5717.645,5726.821,"And we also have a very working family, low income economic status in the neighborhoods that are part of the district.",75,,
656,0.97,5726.821,5743.17,So you would almost think that this would make it impossible when we have other districts that are a lot more affluent and connected to technology and Whatnot.,75,,
657,0.97,5743.17,5747.475,But what is driving this conversation is the energy I heard from many other folks that testified in his hearing.,75,,
658,0.97,5747.475,5751.045,"That hunger to connect, to connect to government.",75,,
659,0.97,5751.045,5759.053,"And with the ideas they have as people living in their neighborhood, seeing their parks and schools.",75,,
660,0.97,5759.053,5764.024,"Kids schools, streets and light posts and saying how can we engage.",75,,
661,0.97,5764.024,5772.299,Many of these community members are not eligible to vote in elections and so they are hungry to really see things change.,75,,
662,0.97,5772.299,5783.711,"And so what we have done in a one-year process that starts the end of summer, goes through the fall and spring process and at the end, voting happens.",75,,
663,0.97,5783.711,5803.43,"It's to collect ideas in the beginning, ring committees together to really think about what is eligible for capital because our projects are mostly through capital, and for structure improvements and development.",75,,
664,0.97,5803.43,5803.931,Then everybody votes.,75,,
665,0.97,5803.931,5815.142,"So what we've been able to see is that our immigrant families are really driving, and the district, they are driving the process because they've seen the value.",75,,
666,0.97,5815.142,5827.788,"Once the project gets into the budget, we see an immediate agency response and we are starting to see the light posts,, or the Playgrounds.",75,,
667,0.97,5827.788,5837.665,"And so in a few years, and this is why, Councilmember Morales, you were saying how quickly can we see results, this will take some time.",75,,
668,0.97,5837.665,5849.977,"But once people start seeing that their ideas are being listened to, that they are able to engage in their understanding the cost of the program or capital improvement, they are able to understand how the government works.",75,,
669,0.97,5849.977,5858.385,"The no longer become outside feeling, they are part of the government.",75,,
670,0.97,5858.385,5861.088,We have parents teaching other parents about how government works and what things cost.,75,,
671,0.97,5861.088,5871.999,"No longer are you doing this as one district office in your community, now there is a whole neighborhood understanding and engaging each other.",75,,
672,0.97,5871.999,5874.668,Bringing the temperature down and saying how do we move this forward.,75,,
673,0.97,5874.668,5883.01,It has launched other auxiliary projects like the fact that our district will now be home to seven new schools.,75,,
674,0.97,5883.01,5892.386,They've taken what they understand from PB and they are now engaging the school authority directly.,75,,
675,0.97,5892.386,5893.52,They say we need more schools.,75,,
676,0.97,5893.52,5896.223,That is not a PB conversation but a Holistic budgetary conversation.,75,,
677,0.97,5896.223,5900.728,It's bringing an intelligence that I was not anticipating.,75,,
678,0.97,5900.728,5905.766,"They are partners with me, they are no longer just angry at government inaction.",75,,
679,0.97,5905.766,5908.135,They are part of the action.,75,,
680,0.97,5908.135,5911.205,So I think that is the first thing I want to leave you with.,75,,
681,0.97,5911.205,5915.542,The second is the access points.,75,,
682,0.97,5915.542,5930.858,"I think there is some criticism sometimes that says well, people who have the luxury of time or higher economic status that allows them to engage, that is just simply not true.",75,,
683,0.97,5930.858,5934.662,We are engaging everyone where they are at.,75,,
684,0.97,5934.662,5946.674,"So a lot of the voting process we do after everyone has pulled their projects together and we create a ballot, we go to churches.",75,,
685,0.97,5946.674,5947.942,Sunday afternoon we talked to people.,75,,
686,0.97,5947.942,5952.212,I get to go and speak to the congregations.,75,,
687,0.97,5952.212,5957.284,And we bring the ballots to the people.,75,,
688,0.97,5957.284,5962.556,"Which is not a typical voting process, but what we want to do is really make this voting process accessible so everyone can engage.",75,,
689,0.97,5962.556,5980.274,"We are removing language barriers, time barriers, removing the kind of institutional barriers . We are going to people directly in talking about the projects.",75,,
690,0.97,5980.274,5986.58,"And what you see, because there is so much excitement around these projects, we have these teams going around saying I worked on this, this is kind of cool.",75,,
691,0.97,5986.58,6001.328,"The last thing I want to say is that it has really ignited young people in understanding the power of their vote in a time where nationally we've seen conversations about votes, whatever side you are on, it is exciting young people and they are understanding their power.",75,,
692,0.97,6001.328,6007.134,"Once the young part is ignited, they are ruined forever.",75,,
693,0.97,6007.134,6009.57,Democracy is in their heart and spirit.,75,,
694,0.97,6009.57,6015.609,So I will leave it there and answer any questions that you have.,75,,
695,0.97,6015.609,6022.883,"Thank you, I really appreciate that Councilmember.",76,,
696,0.97,6022.883,6033.027,"Sean, I want to let you respond and share your thoughts about what the potential for the process Atari budget means for your community.",76,,
697,0.97,6033.027,6039.933,I appreciate the opportunity to be present and share the space.,77,,
698,0.97,6039.933,6052.346,And I appreciate Councilmember from New York and your contributions and insight as somebody who has already begun the process and is fully living into those PB principles and watching the impact it has.,77,,
699,0.97,6052.346,6061.722,"One of the things you said I actually considered and that maybe, people are becoming more a part of the government.",77,,
700,0.97,6061.722,6072.566,I can't speak for the collective us but I can speak for myself individually that I hope is that the PB process has more about reverse effect.,77,,
701,0.97,6072.566,6088.148,"In that people understand that these rights they've been endowed with by their Creator is all the power they need in order to see the type of systemic change happen to allow our voice, our presence in our humanity be honored.",77,,
702,0.97,6088.148,6096.29,I do believe that the compass is pointed and there is an opportunity to go through our true North.,77,,
703,0.97,6096.29,6102.729,"When I woke up this morning and was considering remarks for today, I considered our ancestors.",77,,
704,0.97,6102.729,6122.916,"And what it was like to be enslaved in the South, and to be in these horrific conditions, and not know what they were going into but to know what they were escaping was to something better than their present circumstances that were in front of them today.",77,,
705,0.97,6122.916,6126.186,"And the path ahead, particularly for those who made the journey at first, was not clear.",77,,
706,0.97,6126.186,6131.458,"It was long, arduous, Replicated and difficult.",77,,
707,0.97,6131.458,6135.362,"And yet, still, my ancestors Persevered because there was a deep conviction that there had to be something better.",77,,
708,0.97,6135.362,6140.067,That if we simply traveled North there was something better on the other side.,77,,
709,0.97,6140.067,6148.342,And after experiencing what has been dubbed the Seattle process over and over and over again.,77,,
710,0.97,6148.342,6185.579,"Watching black and Brown and indigenous people of color in our community, our voices, become politicized and used for posturing for the sake of advancing Agendas or Re- election campaigns, it is unmistakably clear to me that what we need to do is begin to travel the new direction and bring the collective Miss along with us as we move forward to a place that builds hope and prosperity in communities that have been historically marginalized and under Resourced.",77,,
711,0.97,6185.579,6202.129,Now anybody listening and all of us on the zoom call right now know with great certainty that $28 million will not even begin to make up for the economic inequalities that are present in the black community.,77,,
712,0.97,6202.129,6206.7,In the economic inequalities that have impacted the indigenous ancestors that are still holding on and living in the Seattle area today.,77,,
713,0.97,6206.7,6218.011,"The economic inequalities that are visited upon our our relatives, people of color, brothers and sisters and on Binary Siblings.",77,,
714,0.97,6218.011,6231.725,It will not begin to make good on the injustices and purchase traded or the Gentrification that continues to happen day in and day out.,77,,
715,0.97,6231.725,6234.628,It will not begin to make up for the inequalities in access to food.,77,,
716,0.97,6234.628,6241.435,And as our friends in the labor movement.,77,,
717,0.97,6241.435,6242.869,Its actual careers and not just jobs.,77,,
718,0.97,6242.869,6244.338,It's $28 million.,77,,
719,0.97,6244.338,6253.447,But what we can do with this $28 million is begin to blaze the trail forward that speaks to how we allocate resources in the future.,77,,
720,0.97,6253.447,6267.461,And a process that can be instilled that says this is the right way to spend money that is coming from taxpayers of the city of Seattle that has been able to meet the needs of the most of us pushed to the farthest of the margins.,77,,
721,0.97,6267.461,6273.8,What that looks like is nothing like what any of us would hope for it to be.,77,,
722,0.97,6273.8,6282.843,"Yes, we need the money urgently but I would much rather personally make sure the path we are traveling is one that is full of equity in that expediency.",77,,
723,0.97,6282.843,6291.284,And that in equitable path forward honors the voices that were impacted is one that we choose.,77,,
724,0.97,6291.284,6296.857,"And when the black brilliance research project, they were quite clear in the feedback they got about the Department of neighborhoods.",77,,
725,0.97,6296.857,6300.527,I will call out a couple of things just for the sake of this conversation.,77,,
726,0.97,6300.527,6309.369,In the research project it said don was ineffective as deeply engaging with communities.,77,,
727,0.97,6309.369,6321.014,People felt that Donna ignored and overpowered the community voice and did not follow up with community after the voting was done and that they broke trust and have a Repairable harm.,77,,
728,0.97,6321.014,6349.476,What they said what they wanted from the lead city Department was someone who was a part of engaging with the buy Caulk communities and those that were set by the community and actually operate in a true ownership that is relational and not just Transactional.,77,,
729,0.97,6349.476,6361.788,That's where we find ourselves in the conversation about the opposite of civil rights in the city of Seattle.,77,,
730,0.97,6361.788,6375.035,"It's existence is to uphold what is right and a lot what is wrong, regardless if it's done from the executive or by the Council.",77,,
731,0.97,6375.035,6384.411,It is uniquely placed to be able to do this work that the data says is being requested to brought forward.,77,,
732,0.97,6384.411,6392.786,"It will take longer, and according to Amy's report, it is also a more costly way forward.",77,,
733,0.97,6392.786,6413.14,"But what is the actual expensive way of doing things we've always done, what is the gradual cost of Self- sacrificing by surrendering to the Supremacist Timeline and really pushing our authority to the White dominant culture in an effort to be to get things done in a hurry.",77,,
734,0.97,6413.14,6424.518,"This 28 million will not build the dam we need, if anything is just a larger bucket to pull water up from communities that are already drowning.",77,,
735,0.97,6424.518,6451.578,"So if it's only a bigger bucket, let us use this moment and opportunity to build a path where we can instruct something different that would make a future that we don't always have to go through the same rotation, the same Rigmarole, because this was Instigated by the social unrest of George Floyd, but this has been a movement built over generations and generations, that embodies many of our ancestors of our past that are living legends.",77,,
736,0.97,6451.578,6454.981,And those movement makers that are present today.,77,,
737,0.97,6454.981,6461.588,I understand that we have to move forward.,77,,
738,0.97,6461.588,6467.561,And that there is a limited patience that often happens in the city of Seattle.,77,,
739,0.97,6467.561,6478.471,"But I ask brothers and sisters that we not begin to think about what we can get right now, but what we can create as we move forward.",77,,
740,0.97,6478.471,6487.914,"And as we create as we move forward, that we hold the city, the Council, the executive and the office of civil rights accountable to honoring Participatory budget at its truest form.",77,,
741,0.97,6487.914,6517.878,"And they make Stakeholders that help make decisions on our behalf and that they are going out and gathering the votes from the people most marginalized and impacted and that those dollars are actually creating the type of programming and resources that we earnestly believe will be catalyst for change, so we can begin to cultivate a future greater than the moment that is now.",77,,
742,0.97,6517.878,6520.78,I am fully persuaded that we can and will move forward together.,77,,
743,0.97,6520.78,6537.163,"I understand that community is not inclusive of all, and we have a diversity of opinions and perspectives and there are multiple ways that resources will be spent in allocated as we continue to move forward.",77,,
744,0.97,6537.163,6546.94,"That being said, with this bucket of money and these resources, let us honor the black brilliance research project.",77,,
745,0.97,6546.94,6548.675,Let's honor the data invoices that were collected therein.,77,,
746,0.97,6548.675,6560.72,"And let's use these dollars to not just fund projects that may last a season, but to plant seeds that will last generations.",77,,
747,0.97,6560.72,6571.064,"Well, thank you Sean, I appreciate everything you said, thank you so much.",78,,
748,0.97,6571.064,6585.211,The thread here is that between what you and the Councilmember said we are planting seeds and blazing a trail.,78,,
749,0.97,6585.211,6586.613,We have a future ahead of us.,78,,
750,0.97,6586.613,6603.096,"And what we need to be really thoughtful about is how to use this resource in a way that Leverages the real possibility, and not just investing in sort of the typical business as usual.",78,,
751,0.97,6603.096,6612.305,"This is about trying something new, and we might not get it right and we have to be okay with that and we have to know we are starting something new and bigger than we've done before.",78,,
752,0.97,6612.305,6616.142,"If we have to course correct along the way, we will do that.",78,,
753,0.97,6616.142,6626.019,But I think it is really important now more than ever to not let perfect be the enemy of the good as we say.,78,,
754,0.97,6626.019,6632.759,"So thank you, thank you for that.",78,,
755,0.97,6632.759,6634.427,I see that Councilmember Pedersen has a question.,78,,
756,0.97,6634.427,6640.567,"Other colleagues, if you have a question, please raise your hand in the future.",78,,
757,0.97,6640.567,6645.972,Thank you chair Mireles and thank you everybody for being here today.,79,,
758,0.97,6645.972,6651.478,And welcome to our Council colleague from New York City.,79,,
759,0.97,6651.478,6659.653,"In terms of how it's done in New York City, you say it's been going on for several years.",79,,
760,0.97,6659.653,6661.688,You mentioned that capital projects is the focus.,79,,
761,0.97,6661.688,6670.897,Is there a reason you have capital projects as your focus rather than social service programs or other types of interventions like that?,79,,
762,0.97,6670.897,6679.406,Thank you for the question.,80,,
763,0.97,6679.406,6681.007,I think there are two main reasons.,80,,
764,0.97,6681.007,6685.979,"One, the capital projects are Impactful in an infrastructure kind of way.",80,,
765,0.97,6685.979,6694.32,"And a lot of the issues that have come through our capital needs in schools, et cetera.",80,,
766,0.97,6694.32,6704.197,"Oh, and one time purchases if you will, one-time projects.",80,,
767,0.97,6704.197,6714.707,"And there are some Councilmembers that have started experimenting with the programmatic, Non- infrastructure, this is more personnel.",80,,
768,0.97,6714.707,6738.965,"What we find are just interesting moments where we think we will be finding this for two or three years, is it just a one off, people voting for one year or less, that requires a more Top-Down, mayoral support.",80,,
769,0.97,6738.965,6741.334,Because they can offer 3 to 5 year contracts.,80,,
770,0.97,6741.334,6743.57,In the Bayer has not been very supportive of that.,80,,
771,0.97,6743.57,6754.881,But it was in recent elections and looks like it was authorized by a charter change that the people voted on.,80,,
772,0.97,6754.881,6759.786,And that will then solve the problem and we are still tinkering through that now.,80,,
773,0.97,6759.786,6770.096,"So long story short, it was easier to do capital because individual members of the Council can do it.",80,,
774,0.97,6770.096,6783.209,We are experiencing with programs and very soon we will see a mayoral agenda that includes three-year and Five- year programs that can solve the Multitier issue.,80,,
775,0.97,6783.209,6786.513,Following up with one additional question.,81,,
776,0.97,6786.513,6794.487,Does New York City pay the participants in the budgeting process?,81,,
777,0.97,6794.487,6795.622,Are you saying the voters?,82,,
778,0.97,6795.622,6805.732,"Yeah, the people that are bottom up Particiating, do they get paid for their time?",83,,
779,0.97,6805.732,6820.647,The only folks that are essentially getting paid through this process are central staff that manage the process and the ballots.,84,,
780,0.97,6820.647,6823.183,The consultants we bring on to help with a marketing strategy.,84,,
781,0.97,6823.183,6830.657,But essentially most of the work is built from the ground up in the District offices and volunteers.,84,,
782,0.97,6830.657,6841.534,"All the committee members that are Inking through some of these pieces, questions about eligibility are driven by volunteers.",84,,
783,0.97,6841.534,6848.975,The city agencies are already doing this work and they are the ones that will be implementing or are already a part of the infrastructure.,84,,
784,0.97,6848.975,6852.278,They are mandated to sit with us and talk through things at the community level.,84,,
785,0.97,6852.278,6861.154,"A lot of this is a volunteer driven at the community level through community boards, community board style.",84,,
786,0.97,6861.154,6867.994,And are not paid.,84,,
787,0.97,6867.994,6885.511,"And just to clarify, in New York City, the way that Participatory budgeting works there is that each Councilmember gets an allotment for Participatory budgeting for your district, which is why the District staff is so much more involved, is that correct?",85,,
788,0.97,6885.511,6886.579,You make that is correct.,85,,
789,0.97,6886.579,6889.182,And that's an important distinction.,85,,
790,0.97,6889.182,6892.518,Because everyone across the country in the world is kind of experimenting.,85,,
791,0.97,6892.518,6894.42,I get about $5 million a year to my discretion.,85,,
792,0.97,6894.42,6899.559,I can do whatever I want with those $5 million.,85,,
793,0.97,6899.559,6911.638,I choose to take four of those 5 million and bring them to the community for decision-making.,85,,
794,0.97,6911.638,6913.94,And that's where community volunteers come together to go through that process.,85,,
795,0.97,6913.94,6921.714,And my staff runs that and facilitates that discussion and supports those volunteers.,85,,
796,0.97,6921.714,6923.349,"We host meetings in our office, et cetera.",85,,
797,0.97,6923.349,6928.254,Those are for capital projects.,85,,
798,0.97,6928.254,6936.462,"And they are essentially following the same the same structure, but adding a different ballot.",85,,
799,0.97,6936.462,6945.872,So people are voting in the spring for both capital and expense.,85,,
800,0.97,6945.872,6949.475,"Councilmemer Herbold, I saw your hand up.",86,,
801,0.97,6949.475,6966.759,I actually had the same question about how to deal with creating potential year-to-year needs with people's interest in programmatic funding when PB priorities might change from year to year.,87,,
802,0.97,6966.759,6969.662,So thank you very much for addressing the.,87,,
803,0.97,6969.662,6979.706,Can I offer a new point to that question?,88,,
804,0.97,6979.706,6980.106,Please.,89,,
805,0.97,6980.106,6989.716,"I think what is interesting about this question, it begs us to ask, how do we create, no, it begs the conversation of the community to say could we do something one time.",90,,
806,0.97,6989.716,6992.685,Can we offer an experimental moment.,90,,
807,0.97,6992.685,6998.524,And some creative stuff has emerged.,90,,
808,0.97,6998.524,7015.274,"People saying we have this one issue and if we had just that one group of helpers we could pay for to kind of unsolved and think about an issue in another way, we could be a different and better community.",90,,
809,0.97,7015.274,7026.619,"So it would be helpful where you don't have a three-year funding stream, and I think it has been very positive.",90,,
810,0.97,7026.619,7039.866,"Thank you, that is helpful, programmatic priorities can be one kind if drawn that way.",91,,
811,0.97,7039.866,7087.28,"It's like a mural, a mural process that really brought people together, discussing hate crimes, and was enough to be able to be Impactful and there we go, rather than funding a social worker, so shifting how we can have communities have something to throw and having some of these agency commissioners say this could be a five year program and now you have dialogue, you have power at the community level saying this is how we want to spend a $20,000 grant.",92,,
812,0.97,7087.28,7092.585,I do have one more question.,93,,
813,0.97,7092.585,7092.985,Please.,94,,
814,0.97,7092.985,7093.586,Thank you.,95,,
815,0.97,7093.586,7127.753,"When I was doing some research on Participatory budget, I came across a data point that said the larger the pot, the more people you have and I'm wondering, I don't know if the number of dollars has been static but if it hasn't and the pot has grown, have you seen were people participating as the pot has grown?",95,,
816,0.97,7127.753,7128.955,That's a really interesting question.,96,,
817,0.97,7128.955,7129.856,For a couple of reasons.,96,,
818,0.97,7129.856,7137.029,One is we actually all get $5 million as Councilmembers to matter what district.,96,,
819,0.97,7137.029,7139.265,There are some districts that I think need more than that.,96,,
820,0.97,7139.265,7144.17,But we all get 5 million.,96,,
821,0.97,7144.17,7152.845,"And at minimum, members that are participating in this initiative have to put at least $1 million down.",96,,
822,0.97,7152.845,7154.247,Most members just put 1 million.,96,,
823,0.97,7154.247,7157.149,Then they take the rest and do what they want to do with it.,96,,
824,0.97,7157.149,7167.026,I put in up to 4 million every year.,96,,
825,0.97,7181.641,7183.109,I think there is something there.,97,,
826,0.97,7183.109,7191.117,What is interesting is this is an interesting marker about precipitate Tatian participation.,97,,
827,0.97,7191.117,7195.321,I was elected seven years ago into the Council.,97,,
828,0.97,7195.321,7203.429,It was surpassed by Participatory budgeting votes a few years later.,97,,
829,0.97,7203.429,7210.736,"So, that was an interesting moment where we are doing something right here.",97,,
830,0.97,7210.736,7218.778,There's something going on where people are engaging because they are seeing their voice impact their neighborhood and usually it is vote for the person and they will give you something.,97,,
831,0.97,7218.778,7222.949,And here they are taking power on their own.,97,,
832,0.97,7222.949,7229.755,That is another fun fact that I'm trying to understand and Digest as I close up my last year.,97,,
833,0.97,7229.755,7233.759,This is my last year in city council.,97,,
834,0.97,7233.759,7235.394,"I think you are onto something there, Councilmember.",97,,
835,0.97,7235.394,7235.962,Thank you.,98,,
836,0.97,7235.962,7242.868,"As you said, you had young people voting, middle schoolers.",98,,
837,0.97,7242.868,7254.68,Those whose immigration status may have precluded them from voting in a city election but were able to engage in whatever they can.,98,,
838,0.97,7254.68,7259.685,"Sean, I would like to ask you one final question and then we do need to move on to our next agenda item.",98,,
839,0.97,7259.685,7260.686,This is a Participatory process.,98,,
840,0.97,7260.686,7264.39,This is about engaging our neighbors.,98,,
841,0.97,7264.39,7268.861,And especially neighbors who may have been left out in the past.,98,,
842,0.97,7268.861,7271.197,We want them to benefit from this opportunity.,98,,
843,0.97,7271.197,7279.205,Do you have thoughts about how we can make sure that people know this opportunity exists?,98,,
844,0.97,7279.205,7286.512,I think a lot of the things we have heard about how the Participatory budget process has worked in the past because a lot of it was Online voting for example.,98,,
845,0.97,7286.512,7291.617,You had to already be engaged with the city in some way to know that you had the opportunity to vote.,98,,
846,0.97,7291.617,7299.125,Can you talk a little bit about what some other ways might be for us to think about getting the word out?,98,,
847,0.97,7299.125,7304.797,I appreciate the ask.,99,,
848,0.97,7304.797,7325.351,"I believe in the heart of Participatory budgeting, the idea that it would go out to an organization and that would employ people who a part of their job is to make sure that folks are rallying around voting and engaging in the process and providing jobs, I think that will be Transformative in and of itself.",99,,
849,0.97,7325.351,7329.622,I also think that our community is full of Stakeholders.,99,,
850,0.97,7329.622,7342.034,Some are traditional Stakeholders that are often divided into spaces to share with people in positions of power and many Stakeholders who aren't typically invited into those conversations.,99,,
851,0.97,7342.034,7359.051,There is enough organization representation across our city to be able to make sure that people in every corner of our community knows and is aware of what is happening.,99,,
852,0.97,7359.051,7363.689,It is going to require us to be intentional on who we engage and how we engage and how we show up.,99,,
853,0.97,7363.689,7373.666,There are moments where it is easy to call on the people who you have the greatest relationship with and activate them and have them do what it is that they can do.,99,,
854,0.97,7373.666,7394.653,"In order for this to be successful and to embrace and engage the collective us, we have to have tough conversations, build bridges that may have been burned by promises that may be Uncapped and grow together as a community if we are going to make sure everyone is being heard and listened to in this process.",99,,
855,0.97,7394.653,7398.624,Thank you.,100,,
856,0.97,7398.624,7403.229,I want to thank Councilmember Menchaca for staying with us from Afton New York.,101,,
857,0.97,7403.229,7406.799,It is after 7:00 there.,101,,
858,0.97,7406.799,7408.2,Thank you Sean for joining us.,101,,
859,0.97,7408.2,7409.034,And thank you to Amy.,101,,
860,0.97,7409.034,7417.743,We are going to move on.,101,,
861,0.97,7417.743,7423.816,"So, Lakisha, can I ask you to please call, don't call the roll, please read the next item into the agenda, into the record, good grief.",101,,
862,0.97,7423.816,7427.953,Counsel bill 12000 zero.,102,,
863,0.97,7427.953,7431.557,An ordinance relating to the organization of the office for civil rights.,102,,
864,0.97,7431.557,7435.027,Breathing discussion and possible vote.,102,,
865,0.97,7435.027,7446.572,"As I mentioned before this bill would extend the term of the OCR director from the end of this year, 2021 to the end of next year, 2022.",103,,
866,0.97,7446.572,7459.552,I would also remove the language added in ordinance 125470 that asks the Department to conduct and are et racial equity Toolkit as that has now been completed.,103,,
867,0.97,7459.552,7467.993,I'm going to hand it over to Asha from central staff to give us the details.,103,,
868,0.97,7467.993,7473.199,I am Asha Venkataraman of the Council central staff.,104,,
869,0.97,7473.199,7478.871,"As Councilmember Morales mentioned, we are talking about counsel bill 120000.",104,,
870,0.97,7478.871,7488.214,She described the effective Precisions of the bill extending the term of the director for the office of civil rights and removing up provision in the code.,104,,
871,0.97,7488.214,7495.921,I will just go back and talk through some of the background and how we got to this place.,104,,
872,0.97,7495.921,7535.427,Back in 2017 Council members had heard of variety concerns from Stakeholders about the ability of the office for civil rights to essentially do its job while still under the Purview of the executive branch and one of the solutions or potential solutions to address those issues were to explore independence as a solution and as a discussion from the committee at a time led to the ask for the office of civil rights to do racial equity Toolkit.,104,,
873,0.97,7535.427,7564.39,Some of the concerns that led to this discussion and the ask for the racial equity Toolkit dealt with the experience of many employees of color that didn't feel had a lot of recourse when they experienced issues around the race or Micro aggressions or race wasn't getting addressed.,104,,
874,0.97,7564.39,7569.261,Management and supervisors that experience was communicated to Council members.,104,,
875,0.97,7569.261,7577.603,One of the other issues came about in terms of how the racial and social justice team was able to do their work.,104,,
876,0.97,7577.603,7588.581,Inherently the work that the RS J I-Team does is intended to critique the institution in which they serve.,104,,
877,0.97,7588.581,7599.525,That comes with Critiquing often the leadership who also happens to be directly the ultimate authority on whether they are employed or not.,104,,
878,0.97,7599.525,7613.939,There is a risk to those employees of being the very job that they have been hired to do in terms of their job security.,104,,
879,0.97,7613.939,7636.061,And one of the issues that prompted this exploration of independence was when the office for civil rights was Tasked with auditing I believe it was FAS at the time that the executives in Encampments to determine whether the administrative rules were being followed.,104,,
880,0.97,7636.061,7639.164,And in the lead up to the release of the report there were concerns about censorship.,104,,
881,0.97,7639.164,7649.274,There were concerns of what the employees had actually seen and would like to have reported on were not allowed to be published in that report.,104,,
882,0.97,7649.274,7673.599,"So, all of that leading to the office for civil rights conducting a racial equity Toolkit and part of the legislation that enacted the racial equity Toolkit also talks about the structure of the Department which was the ask.",104,,
883,0.97,7673.599,7677.136,It also spoke to the leadership structure of the Department.,104,,
884,0.97,7677.136,7684.51,Looking at things like the directors term and removal process.,104,,
885,0.97,7684.51,7699.692,And those elements of the legislation were put in place with the intention that once the racial equity Toolkit was completed there would be some more information about what made the most sense for leadership of the Department.,104,,
886,0.97,7699.692,7702.194,"So, our process began I believe in 2017.",104,,
887,0.97,7702.194,7708.434,But the report itself didn't end up released until 2019.,104,,
888,0.97,7708.434,7711.87,That report came out with five recommendations.,104,,
889,0.97,7711.87,7721.313,Several of the recommendations regarding resources and staffing started to be addressed by both the Council and the executives through the adding of employees and resources.,104,,
890,0.97,7721.313,7726.785,Some of the concerns regarding OCR being Understaffed would be addressed.,104,,
891,0.97,7726.785,7738.464,"But there were some remaining Bigge picture issues that it spoke to in terms of the wider structure of the Department, its placement within the executives.",104,,
892,0.97,7738.464,7743.936,What oversight look like.,104,,
893,0.97,7743.936,7747.239,How accountability was being implemented or not being implemented.,104,,
894,0.97,7747.239,7751.877,A lot of these things spoke to more cultural change issues.,104,,
895,0.97,7751.877,7790.082,"At that point at the end of the 2020 budget process, the process in 20 20 for the 2021 budget, Councilmember Morales had sponsored and the Council adopted a statement of legislative intent which asked the executive to participate in a work group that would go through the rag recommendations and figure out if the remaining recommendations, the ones about oversight and structure were ready to be implemented.",104,,
896,0.97,7790.082,7798.056,That is work that is currently ongoing with the executives so it is not entirely clear what will come out of those recommendations but that response is due back at the end of June.,104,,
897,0.97,7798.056,7807.733,"So, as it relates to this bill there are two primary drivers for the extension of the directors term.",104,,
898,0.97,7807.733,7810.802,The first is related to the Cyrus bonds.,104,,
899,0.97,7810.802,7850.175,"If it turns out at the end of this Cyrus bonds process that there are recommendations to make major changes or to change the Structue of the office for civil rights, the intent of extending the directors term is to ensure that there is some sort of stability in that process so that the person that has been with the staff throughout this past administration will will be in place while any kind of transition occurs while there is any kind of structural change and serve as a stable presence given the potential changes.",104,,
900,0.97,7850.175,7866.658,But given that the work around doing racial equity work and trying to undo institutional racism within the institution is long-term Intergenerational work that is intended to be Transformational and not Transactional.,104,,
901,0.97,7866.658,7883.909,It is possible that the Cyrus bonds might come out with recommendations that don't necessarily say that new structures are ready for implementation at this time but there may be other things that have to happen before Large- scale changes are made.,104,,
902,0.97,7883.909,7899.725,In that situation it is entirely possible that doing that kind of transitional work could take years and the intent here is not to keep extending the term of the director out until the transition is over.,104,,
903,0.97,7899.725,7915.207,"It is just intended to make sure that if the transition were to occur in the next year or so, there would be stability which brings me to the second reason for the existence of the legislation.",104,,
904,0.97,7915.207,7937.963,"Back during the discussions in 2017 about ways in which a department can achieve more or less independence from the executive in this circumstance, or the appointing authority, it became clear that there is no real way to be completely independent.",104,,
905,0.97,7937.963,7949.408,"There are too many interacting factors particularly at the municipal level that require that an appointing authority Hve input, have control and oversight.",104,,
906,0.97,7949.408,7967.192,"So, one of the initiative of independence that was discussed during the initial discussion had to do with the ability of the director to number 1, be protected by just cause protections which we put into place in the legislation back in 2017.",104,,
907,0.97,7967.192,7983.008,But also things like term limits or staggered terms so that the appointing authority and the director didn't necessarily start and stop at the same time but ended up overlapping for a few years.,104,,
908,0.97,7983.008,7988.513,That indicated that there would be some more independence available to the director to be able to do the work of the Department.,104,,
909,0.97,7988.513,7998.79,"So, that brings me to the second reason why this legislation is in place which is to put into place or start to put into place some of that staggering.",104,,
910,0.97,7998.79,8004.596,"So if the term had ended at the end of 2021, it would have been on the same schedule as the term of the mirror.",104,,
911,0.97,8004.596,8017.342,"Instead, to accommodate both the bonds and gradually move toward a more staggered structure, this legislation moves that and 82 2022.",104,,
912,0.97,8017.342,8020.612,At the moment there is full overlap between the terms of the Mayor and the director.,104,,
913,0.97,8020.612,8024.683,This legislation moves it out a year.,104,,
914,0.97,8024.683,8037.496,"It is possible that the recommendations of the Cyrus bonds as we continue to have this conversation that there is some desire for that staggering to continue, that it be two years.",104,,
915,0.97,8037.496,8052.277,For now the intent is to allow for both the Cyrus bonds transition to be more stable and to start the staggering process.,104,,
916,0.97,8052.277,8056.715,That is generally the drivers behind this piece of legislation.,104,,
917,0.97,8056.715,8063.288,I will pause there if there are any questions I can answer.,104,,
918,0.97,8063.288,8064.089,"Thank you, Asher.",105,,
919,0.97,8064.089,8068.76,That is a long history going back to 2017.,105,,
920,0.97,8068.76,8077.903,Q Councilmember her bolt for starting this process.,105,,
921,0.97,8077.903,8080.005,Thank you Councilmember Morales for continuing this important work.,106,,
922,0.97,8080.005,8091.082,I think Asher did a good job of explaining the conditions and concerns that the Council had around independence that led to our engagement around these issues.,106,,
923,0.97,8091.082,8115.707,"My recollection is that the 2017 legislation that asked that was delivered in fall of 2019, but that that 2017 bill actually made a requirement for good cause reasons for termination.",106,,
924,0.97,8115.707,8119.945,Am I right?,106,,
925,0.97,8119.945,8120.946,"Yes, that's right.",107,,
926,0.97,8120.946,8126.952,Does this legislation continue that to maintain that obligation?,108,,
927,0.97,8126.952,8127.452,Will it does.,108,,
928,0.97,8127.452,8129.321,It doesn't make any changes to the just cause protections.,108,,
929,0.97,8129.321,8135.427,It only changes the term and takes out the request to do the Ret since it has already been done.,108,,
930,0.97,8135.427,8141.867,Thank you so much.,109,,
931,0.97,8141.867,8149.741,"Colleagues, any other questions about this piece of legislation?",110,,
932,0.97,8149.741,8155.28,I'm not seeing any hands.,111,,
933,0.97,8155.28,8160.785,"So, I will move that the committee recommends passage of counsel bill 120000.",111,,
934,0.97,8160.785,8163.788,Is there a second?,111,,
935,0.97,8163.788,8164.389,Second.,112,,

948,0.97,8208.099,8217.642,Will the clerk please read item 4 into the record?,120,,
949,0.97,8217.642,8224.349,An ordinance relating to commercial tendencies amending ordinance 126066.,121,,
950,0.97,8224.349,8227.052,Breathing discussion and possible vote.,121,,
951,0.97,8227.052,8227.619,Very good.,122,,
952,0.97,8227.619,8229.854,Thank you Lakisha.,122,,
953,0.97,8229.854,8235.126,This is Council members Herbold is bill that we are addressing.,122,,
954,0.97,8235.126,8240.565,Before I hand it over to Lish would you like to make any comments?,122,,
955,0.97,8240.565,8247.539,Mostly just my thanks to you Councilmember Morales for allowing the legislation to be heard.,123,,
956,0.97,8247.539,8265.19,You were a cosponsor on the original bill that this bill proposes to Tweak to address an issue of timing and make you sure that the protections as we intended in the original legislation are maintained.,123,,
957,0.97,8265.19,8273.298,Really appreciate allowing this to be heard as the commercial Eviction moratorium is expected to end on June 30.,123,,
958,0.97,8273.298,8279.804,Thank you.,124,,
959,0.97,8279.804,8281.306,"Lish from central staff, welcome.",125,,
960,0.97,8281.306,8286.678,Please take it away.,125,,
961,0.97,8286.678,8293.151,Lish Whitson Councilmember staff.,126,,
962,0.97,8293.151,8294.886,This immense legislation that was adapted a year ago.,126,,
963,0.97,8294.886,8311.603,Recognizing very early on in the Covid-19 civil emergency that businesses were going to have a hard time paying their rent on time the Council adopted legislation that allowed for payment plans for those businesses that are not able to pay their rent in a timely manner during the civil emergency.,126,,
964,0.97,8311.603,8315.774,Or for six months after the civil emergency.,126,,
965,0.97,8315.774,8322.614,The payment plans have a couple of criteria.,126,,
966,0.97,8322.614,8337.195,They need to require no more than one third of the late rent be paid in a month and they also are required to fully repay the landlords within a year.,126,,
967,0.97,8337.195,8340.865,After the end of the civil emergency.,126,,
968,0.97,8340.865,8362.487,Small businesses and Nonprofits that their landlords are pointing to provisions in rental agreements that state that if is rent paid late that that is grounds for Eviction.,126,,
969,0.97,8362.487,8374.299,And one piece of this legislation is to clarify that if rent is being paid on time under the payment plan that it is not to be considered late under terms of the lease.,126,,
970,0.97,8374.299,8387.779,The second provision is that some small businesses are having difficulty negotiating payment plans with their landlords.,126,,
971,0.97,8387.779,8432.357,The city's office of economic development has model rental agreements available on the Website if small businesses or nonprofit provide the rental agreement that meets the conditions of ordinance 126066 then the courts assessing the rental agreement should consider that payments under the payment agreement are being paid on time.,126,,
972,0.97,8432.357,8447.772,"So, it is trying to clarify a couple of circumstances where there are conflicts between landlords and small business and nonprofit tenants while maintaining the purpose of the original bill ..",126,,
973,0.97,8447.772,8457.148,"Thank you so much, Lish.",127,,
974,0.97,8457.148,8457.649,Councilmember Pederson?,127,,
975,0.97,8457.649,8460.585,Thank you both for bringing this forward.,128,,
976,0.97,8460.585,8473.398,To refine that original legislation supporting small businesses and other commercial tenants during the pandemic and in the wake of the pandemic.,128,,
977,0.97,8473.398,8480.705,"The question is for our central staff analyst, Lish thank you for your memo.",128,,
978,0.97,8480.705,8500.225,"Because the city council is essentially getting involved in the contractual relationship for good reason and good cause, but just wanted to understand that this is temporary.",128,,
979,0.97,8500.225,8511.803,"After the six-month period Ater the civil emergency is over, eventually this will end, this will sunset.",128,,
980,0.97,8511.803,8512.103,Correct.,129,,
981,0.97,8512.103,8518.243,This is temporary legislation clearly tied to the civil emergency.,129,,
982,0.97,8518.243,8524.115,Thank you.,130,,
983,0.97,8524.115,8531.656,Councilmember Herbold?,131,,
984,0.97,8531.656,8535.927,I'm remembering this is a piece of legislation I think a number of us have touched in different ways.,132,,
985,0.97,8535.927,8539.03,Councilmember Morales I reference the fact that you were a cosponsor to the original bill.,132,,
986,0.97,8539.03,8547.539,Councilmember Pederson as a small business owner that your office referred us to the goddess working on this amendment.,132,,
987,0.97,8547.539,8550.041,So thank you so much.,132,,
988,0.97,8550.041,8550.575,Councilmember Lewis?,133,,
989,0.97,8550.575,8553.244,Did you have a question?,133,,
990,0.97,8553.244,8553.678,Go ahead.,133,,
991,0.97,8553.678,8559.083,"Similar to Councilmember Gonzalez, M times I don't have the hand thing on my resume.",134,,
992,0.97,8559.083,8563.855,I don't know why that happens.,135,,
993,0.97,8563.855,8571.896,"In any event, I just want to jump in here and just signal that I am very excited to vote bill forward today.",136,,
994,0.97,8571.896,8594.452,"I think anything we can do as we are Transitioning now into this stage of recovery to help the small businesses that have hung on through Covid, help them hang on a little longer to get the Tailwind here of the economy reopening and things getting back to normal, this is a good bill that helps us accomplish that.",136,,
995,0.97,8594.452,8604.195,And I did just want to signal my intention here or I should say my interest if the sponsor will have me to sign on at this point as a cosponsor.,136,,
996,0.97,8604.195,8644.435,"I think it Dovetails nicely with efforts from my office on personal guarantee regulations and some other things we have been doing to the Mall early interfere in a productive way to protect and preserve small businesses who are facing potential abuse of legal commitments that they made that did not anticipate a massive, global pandemic that creative massive hardship and put them in potential danger of losing their livelihoods and losing more than just a business, but some of their personal property as well like their house or their savings.",136,,
997,0.97,8644.435,8651.075,"So with that, I did just want to signal my interest in that if the sponsor will have me and we will be voting on the bill today.",136,,
998,0.97,8651.075,8652.977,I will be voting in favor of the bill today.,136,,
999,0.97,8652.977,8658.816,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,137,,
1000,0.97,8658.816,8662.086,"Councilmember Herbold, I saw a thumbs up.",137,,
1001,0.97,8662.086,8662.487,Absolutely.,138,,
1002,0.97,8662.487,8662.82,Thank you.,138,,
1003,0.97,8662.82,8686.778,"I think the reason I think this is so important is because all year I have been hearing from small businesses, restaurants, movie theaters, Nonprofits that are housed in larger buildings on a block, regularly hearing about how people are about to get kicked out.",138,,
1004,0.97,8686.778,8687.278,Landlords are selling.,138,,
1005,0.97,8687.278,8690.715,Property owners are selling and it is understandable.,138,,
1006,0.97,8690.715,8696.421,They aren't receiving rent so it is hard for them to make their mortgage payments.,138,,
1007,0.97,8696.421,8707.398,"That said, what it means for some communities is a real heightened risk of disaster Gentrification and that is part of what we are trying to stop.",138,,
1008,0.97,8707.398,8722.847,"If all of these small businesses and storefronts suddenly become vacant because nobody can afford to pay rent and they have been kicked out, that really leaves the way to flipping all of these properties and then our communities are left with nothing to hold onto.",138,,
1009,0.97,8722.847,8729.954,The businesses that have made their commercial districts vibrant are now gone and who knows what is coming in to replace them.,138,,
1010,0.97,8729.954,8734.025,Or even in fact to replace the buildings they were housed in.,138,,
1011,0.97,8734.025,8748.606,There is a real looming crisis here that our neighborhood commercial districts are at risk if we don't do something to protect the small businesses that are in them and make them vibrant.,138,,
1012,0.97,8748.606,8751.275,"So, I really appreciate this and look forward to supporting it.",138,,
1013,0.97,8751.275,8757.381,"Councilmember Herbold, if there are no other questions I will give Herbold the last word.",138,,
1014,0.97,8757.381,8757.782,Thank you.,138,,
1015,0.97,8757.782,8788.212,"2 thank you, I just wanted to add that I really hope that taking action now will encourage small businesses, Nonprofits and their Lessers to enter into these kinds of conversations about what it will take for tenants to recover and address their arrears to the good of all parties and the communities they serve and to avoid the Cascading impact that was identified as real looming possibilities.",138,,
1016,0.97,8788.212,8799.824,"Cascading impacts that can include not just removal of the businesses that are in the buildings, but the redevelopment of the buildings themselves.",138,,
1017,0.97,8799.824,8813.437,I want to just let folks know that we have reached out to several of the small business owners and Stakeholders who helped us with the original legislation to check for their thoughts.,138,,
1018,0.97,8813.437,8821.579,Joe really emphasized the importance of giving landlords and tenants a reason to sit down together and talk about their respective financial positions and perspectives.,138,,
1019,0.97,8821.579,8836.961,"From his perspective as both a commercial tenant and the landlord, his experience has been that the conversations were difficult at times but he was able to break through in all cases and negotiate plans that have worked for everyone.",138,,
1020,0.97,8836.961,8843.034,We also requested that the Washington state hospitality Association review the proposed legislation and gave them the opportunity to suggest additional changes.,138,,
1021,0.97,8843.034,8845.469,They shared with members who gave it the green light.,138,,
1022,0.97,8845.469,8851.175,"Again, thank you Councilmember Morales are letting us hear this today.",138,,
1023,0.97,8851.175,8853.444,My pleasure.,139,,
1024,0.97,8853.444,8864.021,"Okay, colleagues if there are no other questions, then I move that the committee recommend passage of counsel the 12 zero 000.",139,,
1025,0.97,8864.021,8868.893,It has been moved and Seconded to recommend passage.,140,,
1026,0.97,8868.893,8872.296,Will the clerk please call the role on the committee recommendation that the bill passes.,140,,
1027,0.97,8872.296,8876.4,"Councilmember, the Council bill number was incorrect.",141,,
1028,0.97,8876.4,8881.272,Can you repeat it?,141,,
1029,0.97,8881.272,8882.106,Oh dear.,142,,
1030,0.97,8882.106,8887.178,I move that the committee recommend passage of counsel bill 12 0071.,142,,
1031,0.97,8887.178,8888.98,Is there a second?,142,,
1032,0.97,8888.98,8894.952,It has been moved and Seconded.,143,,
1033,0.97,8894.952,8896.12,Recommended passage of the bill.,143,,
1034,0.97,8896.12,8897.521,Now will the clerk please call the role.,143,,
1035,0.97,8897.521,8899.924,Council member Lewis?,144,,
1036,0.97,8899.924,8900.524,Yes.,145,,
1037,0.97,8900.524,8901.192,Council member Pederson?,146,,
1038,0.97,8901.192,8901.592,Yes.,147,,
1039,0.97,8901.592,8903.628,Council member Herbold?,148,,
1040,0.97,8903.628,8904.028,Yes.,149,,
1041,0.97,8904.028,8906.23,Chair Morales?,150,,
1042,0.97,8906.23,8906.497,Yes.,151,,
1043,0.97,8906.497,8909.7,"For in favor, none opposed.",152,,
1044,0.97,8909.7,8919.877,The bill will move forward to full counsel on May 24 with the recommendation that it do pass.,153,,
1045,0.97,8919.877,8923.114,"Thank you colleagues, we went a little bit long today so I appreciate your indulgence.",153,,
1046,0.97,8923.114,8930.621,I do want to thank Councilmember Menchaca from joining us from New York and Sean Goode.,153,,
1047,0.97,8930.621,8934.258,And to the staff and partners from the labor and environmental justice movements.,153,,
1048,0.97,8934.258,8941.365,"Thanks to Amy Gore, Lish Whitson and Asha Venkataraman from central staff.",153,,
1049,0.97,8941.365,8945.569,I want to make a couple remarks about Participatory budgeting.,153,,
1050,0.97,8945.569,8953.344,I know we have lots of heated conversation happening right now and I just want to say that this isn't and shouldn't be about politics.,153,,
1051,0.97,8953.344,8959.684,We have community members who have asked for this process and I just want to remind us what this is really about.,153,,
1052,0.97,8959.684,8964.889,This is about a new process for stopping harm in our communities.,153,,
1053,0.97,8964.889,8977.768,For creating more inclusive policies and following black and indigenous leadership and it is about investing in thriving solutions where we can Reimagine what community safety looks like or everybody.,153,,
1054,0.97,8977.768,8991.983,"So, we know that this isn't a new process in the city but we can learn from the way we have done it in the past and make some improvements to that.",153,,
1055,0.97,8991.983,9006.397,"We talk a lot in the city about wanting to improve our neighborhoods, reducing violence, creating alternatives for young people, changing our ideas about what community safety looks like and all of that requires a commitment to investing in our neighborhoods in a different kind of way.",153,,
1056,0.97,9006.397,9009.633,And Participatory budgeting allows citizens to do that.,153,,
1057,0.97,9009.633,9023.247,It allows them to identify and discuss and Prioritize public spending as Councilmember Menchaca mentions it engages people and get them to understand government better so they bring down the heat which we can all agree it would be a good thing.,153,,
1058,0.97,9023.247,9031.822,But really gives people real power and real money and that is important.,153,,
