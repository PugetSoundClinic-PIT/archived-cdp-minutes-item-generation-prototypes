29,0.97,118.218,120.153,Thank you so much.,22,,
30,0.97,120.153,127.861,"Councilmembers, the Council rules are silent on allowing electronic participation at meetings.",22,,
31,0.97,127.861,138.271,"To continue participating remotely, I will go through the rules through May 4, 2020 to allow this meeting to occur participating through electronic means.",22,,
32,0.97,138.271,149.048,"So if there is no objection, the Council rules will be suspended to allow electronic participation through May 4, 2020.",22,,
33,0.97,149.048,154.921,"Hearing no objection, the Council rules are suspended.",22,,
34,0.97,154.921,165.431,"The council meetings will be held with members participating electronically through May 4, 2020 and will go through the approval of minutes.",22,,
35,0.97,165.431,170.87,"If there is no Okay, the minutes of March 20th will be adopted.",22,,
36,0.97,170.87,174.14,"Hearing no objection, the minutes are adopted.",22,,
37,0.97,174.14,194.093,"Really quickly, the President's report, I wanted to give folks a quick update off committee schedules through May 4, 2020 which is the period of time that we understand that the stay--the stay home order from the governor is intended to last.",22,,
38,0.97,194.093,206.105,I want to thank each of you for thoughtfully engaging with me in my office in a dialogue around the time sensitive priorities.,22,,
39,0.97,206.105,225.258,I think the Council wide coordination will ensure that we are able to conduct policy work that is Covid-19 related and Council business while not overwhelming the legislative Department's capacity in the period of remote participation and work.,22,,
40,0.97,225.258,236.436,"Since engaging each of you in the conversations, the circumstances of this pandemic and impact on our daily lives and how we do business has drastically changed.",22,,
41,0.97,236.436,251.684,"In light of governor Inslee's Stay-At-Home order and to account for the Bandwide th, they ask that we work with the office to schedule the Agendas and topics.",22,,
42,0.97,251.684,256.122,A good example of this is Councilmember Lewis.,22,,
43,0.97,256.122,269.269,We just recently coordinated with his office and need to have a special meeting on homelessness given the recent news there are hepatitis a outbreak concerns.,22,,
44,0.97,269.269,293.826,"In addition, I think our collective ongoing concerns about how the city is or is not adequately responding to the Covid pandemic cries as it relates on the ongoing crisis and is related to the city's emergency response.",22,,
45,0.97,293.826,304.27,"So you all should have received an invitation on that, and I am sure that the Councilmember will cover that in his briefing.",22,,
46,0.97,304.27,310.743,I am asking for ongoing cooperation from all of you as your needs come up.,22,,
47,0.97,310.743,316.482,We have engaged with Council's central staff and with the clerk's office.,22,,
48,0.97,316.482,328.861,They made a request that committee meetings in the future will be gone on Wednesdays to organize the impact to have the need of essential workers here at City hall to support the committee hearings.,22,,
49,0.97,328.861,353.052,"Again, I think engaging with my office, the central staff and city attorney's office, we will ensure that we are adhering to the governor's proclamation that puts restrictions including on the city of Seattle on what legislative actions we can take, actions including committee meetings even if it's not a final vote on legislation.",22,,
50,0.97,353.052,381.748,The governor's proclamation dates and States any legislative action because the public cannot be physically present at City call to engage in any conversations are things that are necessary and routine for the city business and items that are directly related to the emergency response under the Mayor's civil emergency or governor's civil emergency.,22,,
51,0.97,381.748,415.748,"I think many of you have been made aware of the governor's proclamation, and again, my office with central staff and the city attorney's office and clerk's office are working together to ensure that anything that is slated for a committee meeting or final action by the city council will comply with the governor's order and making sure that I work with all of you on making sure that we have good traffic control to be able to manage the Council's capacity and compliance with the proclamation would be helpful.",22,,
52,0.97,415.748,427.226,So most of the feedback I got from you all indicate that does most committees do not need to meet in April with rare exceptions.,22,,
53,0.97,427.226,433.666,"However, a couple of committees may need meetings in May to deal with the time sensitive legislation.",22,,
54,0.97,433.666,438.971,We will circle back with the Councilmembers before scheduling these.,22,,
55,0.97,438.971,469.769,"As I mentioned earlier, the city clerk's office has provided me with the Specialing of meetings and we hope to follow that guidance with only allowing the special Metings to allow on Wednesdays as I mentioned earlier and providing the clerk with the potential of meetings and minimize the amount of essential employees that have to be present at City Hall.",22,,
56,0.97,469.769,502.101,"Lastly, I'll just say as it relates to public comment I had conversations with the clerk's office, and we are looking at hopefully being able to test some technology that will allow us to hear some version of public comments via zoom and my hope is that we will be able to have that live and ready to go on Monday April 20th during the full council meeting then.",22,,
57,0.97,502.101,512.678,But we are working with our technology Department and clerk's office to test some of the technological tools that are available to us before we go live.,22,,
58,0.97,512.678,539.071,I really appreciate the clerk's office and technology Department's staff for working with my office on identifying how we can best Reintegrate the public comment through technological means to comply with the governor's proclamation around his prohibition of having people physically appear at City Hall.,22,,
59,0.97,539.071,541.707,It's it for my President's report.,22,,
60,0.97,541.707,545.711,I am happy to answer questions about that piece.,22,,
61,0.97,545.711,554.553,"If there is no questions, let me run the first presentation today.",22,,
62,0.97,554.553,555.521,Councilmember Sawant?,22,,
63,0.97,555.521,560.96,"Thank you, president Gonzalez.",23,,
64,0.97,560.96,563.863,I appreciate the speech on public comments.,23,,
65,0.97,563.863,566.098,This is a priority for my office.,23,,
66,0.97,566.098,579.245,And I urge that I discuss with you in our home meeting and follow-up Email to you that we suspend the rules as far as what people are allowed to say in public comment.,23,,
67,0.97,579.245,593.859,I think it would be absolutely appropriate and necessary that at this moment the city council allow all public comments relevant to the Covid crisis at every meeting.,23,,
68,0.97,593.859,595.962,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",24,,
69,0.97,595.962,598.331,I heard your request on that point.,24,,
70,0.97,598.331,603.97,I will not be supporting a blanket suspension of the rules.,24,,
71,0.97,603.97,613.846,I think it's important to maintain consistency with the rules and I intend to follow the approved Council rules are in related to public comment.,24,,
72,0.97,613.846,620.219,We have to be careful and judicious here.,24,,
73,0.97,620.219,636.802,We are under an emergency respond period and a proclamation by the governor in how we connect Theness in business in the light that the public cannot physically convene in chambers to engage in public comment.,24,,
74,0.97,636.802,642.508,I think we have to understand that is not just a Non-Binding resolution.,24,,
75,0.97,642.508,644.143,It's a binding law on us.,24,,
76,0.97,644.143,668.434,"So while I am really working hard to figure out how to provide the public some mechanism to be able to Re- engage in our business, I'm also weighing that with the understanding that--that we have the new legal obligations through May 4 under the governor's proclamation.",24,,
77,0.97,668.434,673.372,I think suspending the Council rules is just not judicious.,24,,
78,0.97,673.372,675.541,A follow up?,25,,
79,0.97,675.541,676.275,Sure.,26,,
80,0.97,676.275,677.176,Thank you.,27,,
81,0.97,677.176,683.516,I do not agree that what I am requesting is any blanket suspension of rules.,27,,
82,0.97,683.516,686.152,I don't agree with that characterization at all.,27,,
83,0.97,686.152,711.677,"In fact, it's very much consistent with what the governor's office has said which is that the work of the elected bodies should now completely focus on the legislation relevant to to relieving the devastation of families and small businesses because of the Covid-19 crisis.",27,,
84,0.97,711.677,722.121,I am making a very specific request that our public be allowed to incorporate the testimony every meeting relevant to the Covid-19 crisis.,27,,
85,0.97,722.121,727.693,I don't see how that is inconsistent with what the governor's office has named.,27,,
86,0.97,727.693,735.167,"If we need a session with the law Department to qualify this, I would be happy to have initiate that.",27,,
87,0.97,735.167,743.242,But I do not agree that we reject allowing public testimony on the crisis in this period.,27,,
88,0.97,743.242,747.012,I think this is not just my request.,27,,
89,0.97,747.012,757.49,"This is, I think, necessary for the Council to enact because--precisely because people in so much crisis.",27,,
90,0.97,757.49,762.695,For so many weeks they have not had access to the city council.,27,,
91,0.97,762.695,776.675,The governor's orders of the elected body should focus on the Covid-19 Crisis-Rolled issues is specifically connected to the concern that the public testimony is concerned.,27,,
92,0.97,776.675,788.42,And I would be happy to initiate a law Department discussion to qualify the details but I think we need to pursue that.,27,,
93,0.97,788.42,792.057,And your request has changed in the last few minutes.,28,,
94,0.97,792.057,800.466,So I am totally in agreement that public testimony needs to be reintroduced.,28,,
95,0.97,800.466,806.105,I disagree with your initiate pitch which is they should be allowed to talk anything they want.,28,,
96,0.97,806.105,806.372,No.,29,,
97,0.97,806.372,808.174,That was not what I said.,29,,
98,0.97,808.174,811.911,I said they should be allowed to speak --,29,,
99,0.97,811.911,812.878,May I finish.,30,,
100,0.97,812.878,814.413,I wasn't interrupting you.,30,,
101,0.97,814.413,816.248,I appreciate the same courtesy.,30,,
102,0.97,816.248,828.627,"So what I heard you say is you wanted public testimony to be reintroduced a, and B, to allow that reintroduction to be unfettered.",30,,
103,0.97,828.627,833.032,"In order, they could testify to anything related to Council business.",30,,
104,0.97,833.032,834.133,I disagree with that approach.,30,,
105,0.97,834.133,850.482,"I believe we need to maintain some level of order to our meetings, and just because I agree there needs to be order doesn't mean I disagree we should have public testimony.",30,,
106,0.97,850.482,858.49,"We will follow the rules and if there is an agenda related to Covid, absolutely, people will be allowed to provide testimony to that particular issue.",30,,
107,0.97,858.49,868.334,But we are not going to just open up the flood gates and allow people to just testify about whatever it is we want to testify about.,30,,
108,0.97,868.334,886.785,We have to maintain a level of consistency with the rules to facilitate the compliance with the governor's proclamation and continue to have some Semlance of order as it relates to the Council business.,30,,
109,0.97,886.785,888.921,I would like to follow up.,31,,
110,0.97,888.921,903.469,"I just want to clarify, as far as my Email is concerned, you are accurate that what I primarily requested was the introduction of public testimony and I am happy that we are in agreement.",31,,
111,0.97,903.469,921.487,"But this morning, I am actually extending my request not only for public comments but to allow people to testify on anything related to Covid-19, not just the legislation at the city council meeting on that particular date.",31,,
112,0.97,921.487,930.529,I don't see what the problem is in renewing the request I have to extend the request.,31,,
113,0.97,930.529,945.377,"You know, I think we all should be doing what my office is doing which is really keeping pace with the crisis and Re- adjusting our priorities.",31,,
114,0.97,945.377,955.087,We officially had a moratorium but that is not enough and that is why we are fighting for suspension of rent and mortgage payments entirely.,31,,
115,0.97,955.087,969.635,"The nature of this crisis is renewing what we are talking about, and that is what has happened, and in the last few days I recognized that we need public comment on Covid-19.",31,,
116,0.97,969.635,1004.803,"I want to clarify that people would not be allowed to testify to anything under the sun but the Covid-19 crisis but I don't think it should be just the legislation that is Express that does way, and president Gonzalez, the only flood gates I want opened are the enormous Multifaceted crisis that we are involved in, and I want like to open this to Covid-19 and not just Covid-19 related legislation.",31,,
117,0.97,1004.803,1005.104,Thank you.,31,,
118,0.97,1005.104,1014.346,Any other questions or comments from my other colleagues?,32,,
119,0.97,1014.346,1014.546,Okay.,32,,
120,0.97,1014.546,1035.167,"Hearing none, that concludes my President's report, and we will move into the briefing and discussion agenda items 3. we will hear a presentation from the office of government intra relations.",32,,
121,0.97,1035.167,1042.141,I want to thank the team for being with us this morning and doing so remotely.,32,,
122,0.97,1042.141,1052.117,I appreciated receiving the recent memorandum really outlining the many different things we can expect in the Federal stimulus package.,32,,
123,0.97,1052.117,1077.276,"I think many of our constituents are uniquely interested and intrigued by what we can expect to see from the recent stimulus package that actually helps working Peopl and folks who are really feeling the impact, the negative impact of the global pandemic.",32,,
124,0.97,1077.276,1088.821,"I am appreciative of Oir's willingness to be with us, and calling in I think from D.C. to be with us.",32,,
125,0.97,1088.821,1100.466,"So without further Ado, I will hand it over, and I will let the folks on the line know that my office just set up an updated Powerpoint presentation from the Oir team.",32,,
126,0.97,1100.466,1103.535,One slide is different than the attached agenda.,32,,

128,0.97,1115.981,1118.116,For you to follow along.,32,,
129,0.97,1118.116,1129.461,"Without further Ado, I'm going to pass it over to the team at Oir.",32,,
130,0.97,1130.762,1136.902,Who will kick us off at Oir?,32,,
131,0.97,1136.902,1137.102,Okay.,32,,

163,0.97,1344.276,1355.654,So we'll go through the bulk of the presentation and walk you through some of the first and second supplemental passages that have happened.,37,,
164,0.97,1355.654,1362.194,But I wanted to take a moment to talk about what we have done.,37,,
165,0.97,1362.194,1379.077,"The Mayor has sent a letter to our congressional delegation for the third supplemental, and that was getting priorities to the city departments working closely at the Federal level right now which is most of our departments.",37,,
166,0.97,1379.077,1385.917,So we are engaging another process for a fourth letter that we hope potentially Council might be able to join the Mayor on.,37,,
167,0.97,1385.917,1390.989,I know a lot of you are looking for opportunities to engage.,37,,
168,0.97,1390.989,1405.67,We would love to work with you on that for additional opportunities going forward but we definitely want to make sure that you all have the opportunity to weigh in in a way that is meaningful to your office as well.,37,,
169,0.97,1405.67,1423.422,"So we have been giving you all the updates we have but if you have other questions or issues, I know the questions, Lily mentioned that we may not get to all of them but we will speak to you throughout the presentation and follow up with you.",37,,
170,0.97,1423.422,1432.23,And I will kick it over to Leslie for her presentation and then take questions throughout if you have them.,37,,
171,0.97,1432.23,1432.597,Thank you.,37,,
172,0.97,1432.597,1433.031,Great.,38,,
173,0.97,1433.031,1434.299,Thank you.,38,,
174,0.97,1434.299,1442.174,And nice to see all of you even under the challenging circumstances.,38,,
175,0.97,1442.174,1452.918,"As the Council President mentioned, we have a slide presentation, and that is being pulled up on the screen right now.",38,,
176,0.97,1452.918,1453.752,"Next slide, please.",38,,
177,0.97,1453.752,1460.158,"So as you all know, we had three passages that for D.C.",38,,
178,0.97,1460.158,1463.895,Have moved at lightning speed.,38,,
179,0.97,1463.895,1466.131,The first round $8.3 billion supplemental.,38,,
180,0.97,1466.131,1481.646,"The second is the family first Coronavirus response act, and then, of course, the third round, $2.Trillion cares act.",38,,
181,0.97,1481.646,1483.348,Next slide.,38,,
182,0.97,1483.348,1494.092,"Round 1, I think, just as Congress was beginning to realize the magnitude and scope the Crisisis, largely focused around the public health response.",38,,
183,0.97,1494.092,1503.869,"You know, with the FDA but really mostly for vaccines and CDC.",38,,
184,0.97,1503.869,1513.245,"Again, because things are moving so quickly in D.C., some of this funding is just becoming available now.",38,,
185,0.97,1513.245,1514.546,"Round 2, please.",38,,
186,0.97,1514.546,1536.568,And round 2 has created a new emergency family medical leave program and price of businesses with less than 500 employees and all public employers were included to increase unemployment claims.,38,,
187,0.97,1536.568,1537.869,"Next slide, please.",38,,
188,0.97,1537.869,1559.925,"As many of you know, priority sector employers with fewer than 500 workers and government entities have to provide partial leave under the family care Act and part-time workers paid sick time including the quarantine order.",38,,
189,0.97,1559.925,1573.638,"So we have quite a bit of flexibility, and we were able to exempt small businesses with fewer than 50 workers from the requirements.",38,,
190,0.97,1573.638,1581.446,Refundable tax credits are available to employers.,38,,
191,0.97,1581.446,1596.294,"Government entities are not eligible for the tax credits, and it's something that we may seek to address in the fourth package.",38,,
192,0.97,1596.294,1598.129,"Next slide, please.",38,,
193,0.97,1598.129,1608.54,"Is recently we had the $2.3 trillion act that was passed, and that includes direct payments to individuals.",38,,
194,0.97,1608.54,1619.15,"So residents up to $75,000 are eligible for the full $1200 payment with an additional $500 per child provided.",38,,
195,0.97,1619.15,1629.127,"And then that benefit then begins to phase out until folks with incomes at $99,000.",38,,
196,0.97,1629.127,1634.299,"For many individuals, the goal is to get this money out quickly.",38,,
197,0.97,1634.299,1639.604,The idea has been that the IRS would be looking at the 2019 or 2018 tax returns.,38,,
198,0.97,1639.604,1661.793,"That is, of course, turning out to be far more complicated as we deal with homeless individuals, and individuals who may not have needed to file a tax return and so the Treasury is trying to work through how to get checks to those individuals as well.",38,,
199,0.97,1661.793,1663.962,"Next slide, please.",38,,
200,0.97,1663.962,1671.369,"In addition, the cares Act provides a fairly dramatic increase in unemployment inventory.",38,,
201,0.97,1671.369,1680.278,It provides an additional 6 There00 per week payment for each recipient up to 13 weeks.,38,,
202,0.97,1680.278,1691.99,Unemployment insurance is available to individuals even to individuals who may have been on unemployment or exceeded the benefits for the year.,38,,
203,0.97,1691.99,1701.499,"And in addition, the unemployment insurance is available for workers including part-time workers.",38,,
204,0.97,1701.499,1708.473,That guidance was released to States late last night.,38,,
205,0.97,1708.473,1709.774,"Next slide, please.",38,,
206,0.97,1709.774,1716.481,Another part of the cares act is the expansion of the FDA's loan program.,38,,
207,0.97,1716.481,1728.026,$350 billion is available for the new paycheck protection program the Ppp that provides 100% security.,38,,
208,0.97,1728.026,1730.462,The loans and guidance became available last week.,38,,
209,0.97,1730.462,1742.107,"The proceeds can be used for payroll, health benefits, salaries, interest on mortgage and rent.",38,,
210,0.97,1742.107,1744.509,"The next slide, please.",38,,
211,0.97,1744.509,1756.521,Borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness for up to 8 weeks of payroll.,38,,
212,0.97,1756.521,1756.755,Sorry.,38,,
213,0.97,1756.755,1767.465,"And all the loans are being processed through current FDA lenders, and they are eligible to become lenders through Ppp.",38,,
214,0.97,1767.465,1780.645,This is turning out to be a fairly complicated process given just the claims that are being filed right now.,38,,
215,0.97,1780.645,1781.579,Next slide please.,38,,
216,0.97,1781.579,1794.092,"$552 million was also made available for economic injury disaster loans, loans up to $2 million with principle and interest deferred up to 4 years.",38,,
217,0.97,1794.092,1808.673,"People applying for these loans are eligible for an emergency advance of up to $10,000 to small businesses and private Non-Profits and it should be noted this is a grant, not a loan and does not require repayment.",38,,
218,0.97,1808.673,1813.244,$17 billion is available for small businesses with Non- disaster loans.,38,,
219,0.97,1813.244,1824.155,These are for businesses that already have the SBA loans and they will not have to pay interest for six months.,38,,
220,0.97,1824.155,1824.823,"Next slide, please.",38,,
221,0.97,1824.823,1832.163,The other piece that is really important for the city of Seattle is the Coronavirus relief Fund.,38,,
222,0.97,1832.163,1844.642,This is $150 billion to provide direct assistance to States to use for expenditures that have been incurred as a result of the Coronavirus epidemic.,38,,
223,0.97,1844.642,1852.283,And the guarantee is a minimum of $1.25 billion for each state.,38,,
224,0.97,1852.283,1868.633,"One thing we worked hard to get included is the cities would be eligible for direct payments from Treasury and the legislation said that Localitiess, counties, or cities with populations over 500,000 are eligible to apply directly.",38,,
225,0.97,1868.633,1875.173,We are working closely with the Treasury Department on the guidance.,38,,
226,0.97,1875.173,1902.0,"We--the city is part of a letter that went to Treasury last week urging them to allow the funds to be used to help cover budget deficits for revenue losses that have occurred as a result of social distancing measures, and the Treasury expects to put guidance out on the funds and release of the funds within the next two weeks.",38,,
227,0.97,1902.0,1910.108,And we expect to see that within two weeks and are aiming to get the dollars out by April 24th.,38,,
228,0.97,1910.108,1912.343,"Next slide, please.",38,,
229,0.97,1912.343,1926.024,The funding also provided $750 million for grants for head start and child care development programs.,38,,
230,0.97,1926.024,1927.191,"Next slide, please.",38,,
231,0.97,1927.191,1935.033,"It also provides increases in food nutrition, $15.5 billion table?",38,,
232,0.97,1935.033,1935.733,Available for snap.,38,,
233,0.97,1935.733,1943.074,One thing to note is the legislation did not increase benefits per family or per individual receiving snap.,38,,
234,0.97,1943.074,1955.453,That may be something that we should look at for the next package going through given the incredible strain that many Fmilies are finding themselves under.,38,,
235,0.97,1955.453,1971.669,And it provides $8.8 billion in child nutrition programs and $450 million which will not even begin to touch the top of the iceberg on the need of the emergency food assistance program.,38,,
236,0.97,1971.669,1972.103,"Next slide, please.",38,,
237,0.97,1972.103,1987.685,"There is 5 billion made available for community developments, $2 billion has been distributed through the regular formula program in 30 days, and that funding has already been released to the city.",38,,
238,0.97,1987.685,2010.375,One billion is going to the state based on a new formula that was not released yet but will factor in health needs and other factors from HUD $2 billion also developed by HUD.,38,,
239,0.97,2010.375,2026.657,"$2 billion for the regular program formula, and that funding has already gone out, and $2 billion through a new formula based on the impact within 90 days.",38,,
240,0.97,2026.657,2027.658,"Next slide, please.",38,,
241,0.97,2027.658,2039.27,"In addition as you may have seen, it officially Codifies some of the rules that the administration had done through executive order.",38,,
242,0.97,2039.27,2063.094,"It Basicallys any Homeowner with an FHA, Va, a Government- backed mortgage experiencing financial hardship is eligible for 6 months Forebearance knowing there is a challenge with the program because not everybody knows if their loan is government backed or not.",38,,
243,0.97,2063.094,2076.374,"That is something to work through, and in addition, Renters paying rent if they live in a property with a federally backed loan.",38,,
244,0.97,2076.374,2076.607,Tricky.,38,,
245,0.97,2076.607,2087.852,Not all Renters finish their landlord has a building that is backed by a government backed loan as well.,38,,
246,0.97,2087.852,2091.989,"Next slide, please.",38,,

250,0.97,2119.851,2124.522,"Next slide, please.",38,,
251,0.97,2124.522,2131.329,And then funding for transit agencies in the response to Coronavirus.,38,,
252,0.97,2131.329,2141.239,These are also going out through formula.,38,,
253,0.97,2141.239,2143.808,"Next slide, please.",38,,
254,0.97,2143.808,2150.381,One thing to note is many of the programs will expire quickly.,38,,
255,0.97,2150.381,2168.466,"The paycheck protection programs will expire at the end of June, and so, you know, for many of the programs what you are beginning to see with the homes, particularly with the House Democrats is the realization is that the crisis will be with us for a while.",38,,
256,0.97,2168.466,2175.606,"The funding that was provided, while an important first step is not nearly enough.",38,,
257,0.97,2175.606,2178.509,"Next slide, please.",38,,
258,0.97,2178.509,2192.857,"So as Lily had mentioned, the House has begin working on a fourth Coronavirus bill to address the issues that the country is facing and make some of the technical corrections that will be needed for the cares act.",38,,
259,0.97,2192.857,2207.405,"I think when the speak her initially begun proposing this bill, there were hopes we would be nearing the end and it would be time to Pivot more of the infrastructure stimulus package.",38,,
260,0.97,2207.405,2236.534,"In the last 4 days, we have seen leadership move away from the concept of infrastructure and acknowledgement we will need a cares part 2 package, expand food and emergency shelter grants to deal with what we are referring to as a survival program and then at this point, it may be too soon to think about a stimulus.",38,,
261,0.97,2236.534,2242.106,"That said, as Lily mentioned, we have been having a number of conversations within the city to get ready.",38,,
262,0.97,2242.106,2251.148,"At some point, a stimulus is going to be appropriate and needed and given how things have moved in Washington, we want to be ready for that.",38,,
263,0.97,2251.148,2258.489,We have been working closely with departments to identify their infrastructure needs.,38,,
264,0.97,2258.489,2268.466,"Looking back at the programs that were created, looking ahead to things that we may want to push the envelope on and be ready for that as well.",38,,
265,0.97,2268.466,2274.238,So I'm going to stop there and I'm happy to take any questions.,38,,
266,0.97,2274.238,2275.94,"Thank you, Leslie.",39,,
267,0.97,2275.94,2284.282,"It looks like we have a question from Councilmember Herbold, please.",39,,
268,0.97,2284.282,2285.883,Thank you.,40,,
269,0.97,2285.883,2286.284,Two questions.,40,,
270,0.97,2286.284,2291.055,The first relates to the payroll protection program.,40,,
271,0.97,2291.055,2295.359,We are hearing from small businesses.,40,,
272,0.97,2295.359,2298.596,They are flowering lenders that they are waiting for guidance.,40,,
273,0.97,2298.596,2308.939,"Since they don't have guidance from the Federal Government, they aren't actually ready to accept claims locally.",40,,
274,0.97,2308.939,2318.582,"So business owners are worried they will Miss an opportunity because the awards are first come, first serve.",40,,
275,0.97,2318.582,2326.824,So looking for advice you might have for us to give local small business owners who are waiting to apply.,40,,
276,0.97,2326.824,2359.657,"And then my second question is on one of the--one of the slides, you showed funding that has already been allocated according to the regular formula as well as homeless assistance grants, and the number on the screen was I think about $9.5 million for both categories.",40,,
277,0.97,2359.657,2361.492,Is that a Seattle allocation?,40,,
278,0.97,2361.492,2364.428,It wasn't clear with the words that you were saying.,40,,
279,0.97,2364.428,2364.695,Yes.,41,,
280,0.97,2364.695,2371.402,So that is the Seattle allocation.,41,,
281,0.97,2371.402,2377.775,And then the loans became available last week O Friday.,41,,
282,0.97,2377.775,2379.443,Guidance has been released for that.,41,,
283,0.97,2379.443,2381.579,There has been a rush.,41,,
284,0.97,2381.579,2391.489,Our understanding is given the Penalty-Up demand it's been difficult to apply for those because there is so much need.,41,,
285,0.97,2391.489,2397.394,"So small businesses should not expect to be told anymore by the lenders, don't apply.",42,,
286,0.97,2397.394,2401.665,We haven't received the guidance yet.,42,,
287,0.97,2401.665,2402.433,Correct.,43,,
288,0.97,2402.433,2402.967,Okay.,44,,
289,0.97,2402.967,2403.567,Thank you.,44,,
290,0.97,2403.567,2404.969,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",45,,
291,0.97,2404.969,2414.478,Are there any other questions from my colleagues?,45,,
292,0.97,2414.478,2415.78,Okay.,45,,
293,0.97,2415.78,2416.113,There we go.,45,,
294,0.97,2416.113,2416.347,Sorry.,45,,
295,0.97,2416.347,2423.921,"I couldn't--I asked you all to raise your hands, and then my screen was too small on the video.",45,,
296,0.97,2423.921,2426.123,I couldn't see you.,45,,
297,0.97,2426.123,2427.992,"Councilmember Sawant, please.",45,,
298,0.97,2427.992,2429.393,Thank you.,46,,
299,0.97,2429.393,2434.799,"Just a question to ask, does the staff know anything more than what we were told on the news?",46,,
300,0.97,2434.799,2447.878,"Yesterday, we heard that Boeing will extend the shutdown which is very important because of Boeing mechanics.",46,,
301,0.97,2447.878,2454.985,What happened is they announced that they would be going back to work.,46,,
302,0.97,2454.985,2458.389,They announced that they were extending the shut down.,46,,
303,0.97,2458.389,2493.49,"But the Seattle times said that they are paying the workers for two weeks, and do they have to take sick time or apply for unemployment especially considering that Boeing has 10 billion cash on hand at the beginning of the year, and now, as a result of the stimulus package, the company now has easy access to inexpensive Federal loans and loan guarantees.",46,,
304,0.97,2493.49,2495.192,Do you have a number on that?,46,,
305,0.97,2495.192,2498.829,You know that they are getting help from the government?,46,,
306,0.97,2498.829,2521.619,"And in that context, the workers are getting their own benefits, simply off loading should be coming from the hat executives and major shareholders who have rewarded themselves last year despite poor decision making.",46,,
307,0.97,2521.619,2526.457,I wonder if you have any more information on that.,46,,
308,0.97,2526.457,2542.139,Is there pressure put on Boeing executives by elected officials in Congress from Washington State to do the right thing here?,46,,
309,0.97,2542.139,2542.673,Thank you.,46,,
310,0.97,2542.673,2549.98,So I can look at exactly the package that Boeing is expected to receive.,47,,
311,0.97,2549.98,2558.989,"There is, especially from Democrats, real concern about how much corporate executives are going to make if they access funding.",47,,
312,0.97,2558.989,2568.265,That was a central part of the issues surrounding the cares act.,47,,
313,0.97,2568.265,2578.275,Republicans had initially introduced--had initially introduced a Gill bill with very few Guardrails on it.,47,,
314,0.97,2578.275,2580.945,And the Democrats tries to increase those.,47,,
315,0.97,2580.945,2596.293,I think the number of Democrats said it well that this final bill that was approved is not the bill that they would have designed themselves but the one that they felt like they could get across and then still get benefits to families and Judgeds as well.,47,,
316,0.97,2596.293,2602.099,But I'm happy to follow up with any information on what things are provided to Airlines specifically.,47,,
317,0.97,2602.099,2605.669,Thank you.,48,,
318,0.97,2605.669,2606.603,That would be good.,48,,
319,0.97,2606.603,2617.414,Any other questions for Leslie from my colleagues?,49,,

324,0.97,2632.196,2632.596,Thank you.,52,,
325,0.97,2632.596,2640.738,"Leslie and everyone, thank you for the comprehensive over Veuvment one of the things we were interested in was the building for housing.",52,,
326,0.97,2640.738,2649.38,We talked about how there could be a longer term infrastructure package for a new Iteration of the cares package.,52,,
327,0.97,2649.38,2650.848,So appreciate that.,52,,
328,0.97,2650.848,2658.789,Is there anything you can emphasize on the operation and maintenance dollars that would go to existing supportive housing?,52,,
329,0.97,2658.789,2669.066,I say that because we hear from so many people working in assisted housing that they don't have the operation and maintenance dollars.,52,,
330,0.97,2669.066,2679.309,"They are losing staff because of illness or increased capacity, and that's where we are lacking dollars.",52,,
331,0.97,2679.309,2687.451,The biggest crisis in addition to meeting the funding to build more affordable housing.,52,,
332,0.97,2687.451,2688.519,Thank you.,53,,
333,0.97,2688.519,2706.036,"I think that's a great point and what we will be looking at in the next package and again, as this crisis grows in magnitude and in length, people are beginning to realize all the implications.",53,,
334,0.97,2706.036,2714.111,"That's something that we should emphasize, and we have been in close contact with our delegation.",53,,
335,0.97,2714.111,2728.826,And they are asking specifically if there are anecdotal examples or data to provide the challenges that they are facing.,53,,
336,0.97,2728.826,2730.494,I think that would be really appreciated.,53,,
337,0.97,2730.494,2732.796,Thank you very much.,54,,
338,0.97,2732.796,2740.537,We will pull together a summary and similar concerns and your office can perhaps let us know through our office.,54,,
339,0.97,2740.537,2743.207,We will compile that for you if that sounds good.,54,,
340,0.97,2743.207,2745.943,That would be great.,55,,
341,0.97,2745.943,2754.785,"Robin, do you have additional information on that particular question?",56,,
342,0.97,2754.785,2759.223,"I do, Council President.",57,,
343,0.97,2759.223,2765.295,"Councilmember Mosqueda, we have been working closely with the housing providers.",58,,
344,0.97,2765.295,2772.169,We have done a survey that we have sent out to all the housing providers that we work with normally.,58,,
345,0.97,2772.169,2777.674,They are getting back questions and answers to us about the impacts on budgets and things like that.,58,,
346,0.97,2777.674,2781.178,And we'll be happy to share that when that is finished.,58,,
347,0.97,2781.178,2793.557,I will say that we are looking for communities to see where any of the Federal funding might be used for that and looking at additional opportunities as Leslie said for the fourth package.,58,,
348,0.97,2793.557,2801.231,Your concerns are well taken and heard.,58,,
349,0.97,2801.231,2802.099,Okay.,59,,
350,0.97,2802.099,2802.399,Thank you.,59,,
351,0.97,2802.399,2803.033,"Thank you, Robin.",59,,
352,0.97,2803.033,2808.705,We will move over to Councilmember Herbold now.,59,,
353,0.97,2808.705,2815.412,"You are on mute, Councilmember Herbold.",59,,
354,0.97,2815.412,2820.384,A quick 2 part question.,60,,
355,0.97,2820.384,2827.357,You mentioned earlier on Friday there was guidance on the economic relief openings available to gate workers.,60,,
356,0.97,2827.357,2860.19,"I wonder if you could give a quick high-level overview of what that looks like, and then as it relates to round 4 issues, I just want to flag that one of the things I'm hearing locally that there is a national effort to get recognition of the increase in domestic violence incidents.",60,,
357,0.97,2860.19,2880.11,"The police Department has identified a 22% increase in calls where as in the $2.2 trillion package, there was additional funding for domestic violence Hotlines and funding implementation of the domestic violence protection act.",60,,
358,0.97,2880.11,2888.585,There is the national network right now that has a $100 million request in.,60,,
359,0.97,2888.585,2891.722,I want to flag that.,60,,
360,0.97,2891.722,2904.434,"Jurisdictions across the nation are working to document the increase that they are experiencing in the next round like we are beginning to do so now here, too.",60,,
361,0.97,2904.434,2905.168,Thank you.,60,,
362,0.97,2905.168,2905.736,Great.,61,,
363,0.97,2905.736,2908.905,A couple of items.,61,,
364,0.97,2908.905,2960.223,"So on the guidance released last night on part-time workers, labor is--they are recognizing the complexities and they are very clear if you are filing a 1099 or don't have a place of employment like Uber drivers may not, all of those, we have actually sent those out to the city and are happy to have Oir send those to you as well so your team can take a look at that, and then on the domestic violence front, that's an issue we are sharing with cities across the country as well, and resources that will be needed to address that in this incredibly complex time.",61,,
365,0.97,2960.223,2966.129,That is something that we need to consider for the fourth package.,61,,
366,0.97,2966.129,2968.965,"Thank you, Leslie and Councilmember Herbold.",62,,
367,0.97,2968.965,2970.6,I see Lily has her hand up.,62,,
368,0.97,2970.6,2971.902,Take it away.,62,,
369,0.97,2971.902,2984.815,I just wanted to recommend for Councilmember Herbold's question around some of the small business relief in Accessing the funding which it sounds like is not an uncomplicated process.,63,,
370,0.97,2984.815,3001.398,"The Office of economic development has started a Hotline for small business and they do a weekly call, and I wanted to recommend that any business owners that contact you, they are a great resource for small business.",63,,
371,0.97,3001.398,3003.433,"Thank you, Lily.",64,,
372,0.97,3003.433,3012.609,Any other questions from my colleagues?,64,,
373,0.97,3012.609,3012.943,Or comments?,64,,
374,0.97,3012.943,3013.143,Okay.,64,,
375,0.97,3013.143,3022.686,I am not seeing anyone raise their hand or hearing from folks on the phone who don't have the Video feed.,64,,
376,0.97,3022.686,3038.135,"I just--you know, Leslie, I wanted to get your thoughts on something that is of concern to me which is a lot of our immigrant refugee neighbors have been left out of this stimulus package.",64,,
377,0.97,3038.135,3069.533,"On a call that some of us were on last week with Congress members Smith, we heard from them that some of the dollars coming from this stimulus package through the state are actually--could be considered unrestricted and utilized to support immigrant and refugee communicate members including those that are either Daca recipients or otherwise Undocumented.",64,,
378,0.97,3069.533,3106.103,"I just wanted to get a sense from you about whether you have done analysis on that aspect of the Federal stimulus package and if not, if that is something you will be able to do, and Secondly as a follow up to that, I would really like to, you know, try to figure out how we can expect the city's support to make sure that we are including all immigrant and refugee stimulant members in the stimulus package.",64,,
379,0.97,3106.103,3121.918,"Yeah, so, I think again, this is another issue that is concerning to a number of cities across the the country, you know, whether or free testing and making sure that immigrant and vulnerable communities have access to that.",65,,
380,0.97,3121.918,3142.139,"There is a list of items that we have been looking at that we are happy to send and involve your thoughts on as well to build on because, again, the packages have not done a great job in supporting the immigrant communities.",65,,
381,0.97,3142.139,3154.618,There is a discussion for awareness and may be on your radar about Accessing benefits and whether or not that would or will not have a public charge.,65,,
382,0.97,3154.618,3160.49,We can put together a brief to send your way as well.,65,,
383,0.97,3160.49,3168.632,"In terms of state dollars, that is something we can coordinate on the phone together.",65,,
384,0.97,3168.632,3169.633,Thank you.,66,,
385,0.97,3169.633,3203.633,"I would like to see the brief on the public charge access with a temporary minor relief on the front of the pandemic but I think it would be helpful to get a good understanding of where the lines are drawn by the Feds as we look at figuring out how to engage in the next stimulus package, you know, battle, frankly.",66,,
386,0.97,3203.633,3212.375,"Actually, this morning as well I see there was an outstanding brief of things that were included and things that need to be asked for in the next package.",67,,
387,0.97,3212.375,3214.511,"We can send that around, too.",67,,
388,0.97,3214.511,3214.945,Wonderful.,68,,
389,0.97,3214.945,3220.05,I think many of us would have a strong interest in seeing that.,68,,
390,0.97,3220.05,3222.152,So that would be great.,68,,
391,0.97,3222.152,3223.186,Will do.,69,,
392,0.97,3223.186,3258.121,"One last piece from me is, you know, I think that oftentimes when we think about our work at Oir, if we are in an active legislative session at the state we are actively engaged with our Oir team in terms of lobbying and active Lobbyingests EST efforts with a defined agenda.",70,,
393,0.97,3258.121,3292.989,"I think it's important to understand from Oir, how you are envisioning moving forward through the next several months as it relates to how the city is Leveraging the resources in your office to continue to lobby and advocate both at the state and Federal level on the stimulus package and some other potential policy issues that might arise at the state or Federal level.",70,,
394,0.97,3292.989,3296.593,Just to respond to that--can everyone hear me?,71,,
395,0.97,3296.593,3309.005,"I--so as we brief the Council through the legislative session we're doing that on a weekly bases, given at the state level, we will likely move into a short special session.",71,,
396,0.97,3309.005,3317.447,We will schedule things as needed as there is relevant information for you all.,71,,
397,0.97,3317.447,3331.428,"Right now, the state legislator are not convening and making the policies but as they gear towards that they are trying to inventory the outstanding needs which Robin will speak to.",71,,
398,0.97,3331.428,3338.134,"On the Federal level, Let'Sly and I have talked about, a game of hurry up and wait.",71,,
399,0.97,3338.134,3353.817,"While we are pushing, pushing, pushing to priorities to include letters sent to Congress, given the push back from other members of the Federal level, we know that is--it would be a real challenge to move to late April.",71,,
400,0.97,3353.817,3368.198,"As those things start to build, and we need direction from you all in terms of your priority, we will make sure to that about Proactive versus a briefing right now because the legislate sure not in session.",71,,
401,0.97,3368.198,3373.303,"But as needed, we will schedule the meetings to keep you updated.",71,,
402,0.97,3373.303,3376.106,"Thank you, Lily.",72,,
403,0.97,3376.106,3385.648,I appreciate your willingness and team's suggestions to try and coordinate our interest in the Federal and state issues through my office.,72,,
404,0.97,3385.648,3388.318,Happy to continue to serve the role.,72,,
405,0.97,3388.318,3405.001,"Councilmembers are free to reach out to you directly as well but I think it's important for us to continue to be engaged in the quickly, in some instances, quickly and rapidly moving instances at the Federal and state level.",72,,
406,0.97,3405.001,3409.773,Any other questions on the Federal presentation before we move on to Robin?,72,,
407,0.97,3409.773,3410.073,All right.,72,,
408,0.97,3410.073,3414.611,We are gonNA move into the next set of information.,72,,
409,0.97,3414.611,3420.65,I think it's Robin that will present at this point.,72,,
410,0.97,3420.65,3423.987,Thank you Council President Gonzalez and thank you everyone.,73,,
411,0.97,3423.987,3433.363,I wanted to start off with just thanking some people at the state level who have been extraordinary in responding to this crisis.,73,,
412,0.97,3433.363,3453.983,"The governor's office staff have been, you know, working around the clock to get funds and to get a handle on the crisis and I am sure everyone has seen the governor himself, and I feel grateful for all the work that they are doing.",73,,
413,0.97,3453.983,3473.203,"And also, lance Commissioner Hillary friends has been stepping up in a way that is amazing.",73,,
414,0.97,3473.203,3483.746,"The Department of Commerce has a way of getting grants out that are flexible to counties around the state, and they had that ready in a couple of days.",73,,
415,0.97,3483.746,3494.057,"The staff has been incredible, and, you know, I think in recognizing this is a crisis, and that we, as local governments, really need flexibility.",73,,
416,0.97,3494.057,3515.278,"So I just want to appreciate them and Relays to you all that they are working behalf they are working as quickly as they can as Lily said, there will be a special session.",73,,
417,0.97,3515.278,3517.413,We don't know when.,73,,
418,0.97,3517.413,3528.791,But we are thinking it will be in June after the next revenue pro Jections come in.,73,,
419,0.97,3528.791,3539.903,He was asked on the stay home stay healthy order and he said he was in conversations with the leadership and they will call a session if they need to.,73,,
420,0.97,3539.903,3547.41,They have figured out a way to vote without being too close to one another as well.,73,,
421,0.97,3547.41,3552.815,I think that was an indication he believes there will be one as well.,73,,
422,0.97,3552.815,3582.145,"Speaking of the governor, he vetoed a number of line items in the budget on Friday to try and address new programs and stick to the basics if he could to try to, you know, circumvent which is, of course, going to be serious budget shortfalls that everyone assumes will be coming in the near future.",73,,
423,0.97,3582.145,3607.971,He vetoed 147 new Extenditure resulting in $445 million in cuts and some of the things that were felt that--I will get you a more thorough list this Friday afternoon.,73,,
424,0.97,3607.971,3616.612,We haven't gotten a chance to analyze everything in detail but I will certainly give you a list of the items as they impact the city.,73,,
425,0.97,3616.612,3633.229,"One large item is there was $50 million for the climate resiliency accounts that was cut, $100 million for new school counselors, Postpartum Medicaid coverage was also cut.",73,,
426,0.97,3633.229,3635.832,That was enacted in Senate bill 6158.,73,,
427,0.97,3635.832,3652.048,It is true that no one during the Covid-19 crisis will be term--terminated from Medicaid but they will be terminated at the end.,73,,
428,0.97,3652.048,3672.335,We have contact from the lobbyists saying they don't think that the authority will investigate the extension.,73,,
429,0.97,3672.335,3684.747,And the science center nature innovation lab that was cut and an exemption from real estate excise tax.,73,,
430,0.97,3684.747,3705.702,"If you sell a building and keep it for affordable housing, that was cut, and the counties can still enact the some programs if they wanted to.",73,,
431,0.97,3705.702,3715.011,I was not going to talk about the housing bill because it was covered extensively in the memo that we sent.,73,,
432,0.97,3715.011,3727.757,"It was passed to give $200 million to address the Covid crisis, and we have seen some of the money released already that I will talk about later.",73,,
433,0.97,3727.757,3740.036,I did want to talk about unemployment insurance because a Numberof you have asked about that.,73,,
434,0.97,3740.036,3746.709,"There is an unprecedented amount of claims, you know, in a very different way than in the great recession.",73,,
435,0.97,3746.709,3750.413,This all happened in a matter of weeks.,73,,
436,0.97,3750.413,3762.358,"There were 350,000 new claims in the month of March and just the week of March 22nd, there were 182,000 claims.",73,,
437,0.97,3762.358,3769.098,"So Obviously, the Department is struggling to respond to that.",73,,
438,0.97,3769.098,3776.973,"That 182,000 number is 7 times the peak week during the great recession and 41% over the weeks before.",73,,
439,0.97,3776.973,3784.413,"So giving you an idea of the scale that they really are, you know, dealing with something that is unprecedented.",73,,
440,0.97,3784.413,3786.716,They are working on extending capacity.,73,,
441,0.97,3786.716,3790.586,They are hiring additional workers to process claims.,73,,
442,0.97,3790.586,3793.589,They are reassigning other state workers.,73,,
443,0.97,3793.589,3801.497,Microsoft is expecting to add capacity to the employment security Department Website so it couldn't crash.,73,,
444,0.97,3801.497,3805.868,It was extraordinary to do that.,73,,
445,0.97,3805.868,3828.858,"They have--employment security said it would take them 3 weeks or at least two weeks from now for the $600 extra benefit, and how they will process the gate or contract worker claims more easily.",73,,
446,0.97,3828.858,3830.459,Let's see.,73,,
447,0.97,3830.459,3830.66,Okay.,73,,
448,0.97,3830.66,3840.102,So there is also some work being done with some of the unions and other unemployment insurance advocates.,73,,
449,0.97,3840.102,3848.11,And seeing if there isn't something to be done around the immigrant and refugee benefits since they were left out of the Federal legislation.,73,,
450,0.97,3848.11,3857.019,There may be opportunities for others to make sure that the coverage is as broad as possible.,73,,
451,0.97,3857.019,3867.129,I think there is a very good web page that you can direct constituents to with Covid-19 that I provided a link to in the brief.,73,,
452,0.97,3867.129,3871.1,You could direct people to the unemployment law project.,73,,
453,0.97,3871.1,3878.274,"They may be able to help but just flagging that, of course, they are inundated with people needing assistance.",73,,
454,0.97,3878.274,3889.852,I think that the place that they can be really helpful is if people don't have a phone to call in with benefits or a computer or if it's a worker who was denied.,73,,
455,0.97,3889.852,3901.864,I think that's the place to step in and be helpful right now.,73,,
456,0.97,3901.864,3905.034,I'm sorry to interrupt.,74,,
457,0.97,3905.034,3905.568,Two things.,74,,
458,0.97,3905.568,3918.714,"One is on the unemployment issues, I know the law project was the place most people are sent to, and as you alluded to, they are probably beyond their capacity.",74,,
459,0.97,3918.714,3950.179,"There is also a really good Website, Www.Washingtonlawhelp.Org that is quite good in terms of easily Digistable Faq-Style information for--for folks who want to just get a better understanding of what their rights and responsibilities for unemployment insurance.",74,,
460,0.97,3950.179,3953.349,I wanted to put that out there as a resource as well.,74,,
461,0.97,3953.349,3953.749,That's great.,75,,
462,0.97,3953.749,3954.216,Thank you very much.,75,,
463,0.97,3954.216,3955.918,I didn't know about that.,75,,
464,0.97,3955.918,3959.322,I will start telling people about that.,75,,
465,0.97,3959.322,3964.46,Just a couple of additional things I wanted to touch on quickly.,75,,
466,0.97,3964.46,3971.367,The Department of Commerce has gotten the emergency housing grant.,75,,
467,0.97,3971.367,3974.57,They made $30 million available to counties around the state.,75,,
468,0.97,3974.57,3989.385,$20 million of that came from shelter Enhancement money that was included in the regular state operating budget and another $10 million was out of the money that came through House bill 2965 through the rainy day Fund.,75,,
469,0.97,3989.385,4002.098,They hope that they will be able to get the $20 million reimbursed possibly through other means so that they will be able to still have the $20 million available for shelter Enhancement.,75,,
470,0.97,4002.098,4007.069,But they really wanted to get resources on the street as quickly as they could.,75,,
471,0.97,4007.069,4023.619,"That money can be used very broadly for Covid response for quarantine, isolation, sanitation, any housing need you can think of.",75,,
472,0.97,4023.619,4034.93,"King County has $20 million through the Fund, and the city coordinated with King County so the resources will benefit the city of Seattle.",75,,
473,0.97,4034.93,4042.038,I wanted to touch on foreclosure and mortgage Forebearance.,75,,
474,0.97,4042.038,4046.675,Leslie talked on the federally backed loans.,75,,
475,0.97,4046.675,4053.482,The governor has strongly encouraged banks to offer Forebearance and halt foreclosures.,75,,
476,0.97,4053.482,4065.061,I understand there is work to be done to negotiate banks to come up with a package of items that will be offered to people so each bank would be offering the same thing.,75,,
477,0.97,4065.061,4077.106,"I think it makes it easier for banks to know what they night get or ask for, and you know t gives advocates more Toehold with helping people.",75,,
478,0.97,4077.106,4079.008,California has done something similar.,75,,
479,0.97,4079.008,4082.778,We are hopeful and working on that to encourage that to happen.,75,,
480,0.97,4082.778,4088.918,"And then, finally, you know there, is also a statewide Eviction moratorium.",75,,
481,0.97,4088.918,4102.231,"Obviously, the city of Seattle's goes for longer and covers more things, it covers late fees with ongoing advocacy to get the moratorium to cover the late fees and extend it.",75,,
482,0.97,4102.231,4111.407,What I am hearing from the housing advocates is they expect that to happen.,75,,
483,0.97,4111.407,4117.012,"I think you identified that as a need, and the office of housing recognizes that as well.",75,,
484,0.97,4117.012,4123.552,I think we will have announcements in the coming days but we all recognize that is an area we will need to address in the near future.,75,,
485,0.97,4123.552,4124.753,That's all I had.,75,,
486,0.97,4124.753,4127.823,I will be happy to take questions.,75,,
487,0.97,4127.823,4129.258,"Thank you, Robin.",76,,

495,0.97,4147.643,4166.929,"On page 23 of the Powerpoint, and you spoke to this a bit, on the foreclosure and postponement of Forebarons and you are looking to negotiate with the banks, et cetera, who would those conversations look like and how could we help locally?",79,,
496,0.97,4166.929,4175.137,The state regulates the relationship with banks via Federal law.,79,,
497,0.97,4175.137,4179.575,So how does the Seattle city council work with the information like boots on the ground?,79,,
498,0.97,4179.575,4183.045,How do we get this done?,79,,
499,0.97,4183.045,4195.19,"That was the issue we heard, not just with Renters but mortgage and small businesses.",79,,

504,0.97,4216.712,4217.913,You are correct.,80,,
505,0.97,4217.913,4228.724,"It's a little difficult for a state approach, and I think California went pretty much as far as they could, you know.",80,,
506,0.97,4228.724,4233.696,It's voluntary on the bank's part since they are mostly federally regulated.,80,,
507,0.97,4233.696,4236.832,But I think it's just very helpful to consumers.,80,,
508,0.97,4236.832,4241.036,We will get back to you on that Councilmember.,80,,
509,0.97,4241.036,4242.504,"Council President, may I follow up?",81,,

511,0.97,4243.238,4261.123,"So if you are going to have the conversations--thank you, Lily, as well--we want to make sure that we reward and encourage and post wide those banks that are working with small knows, Renters, mortgage holders.",82,,

514,0.97,4272.268,4288.35,"I am hoping what we can see is at the end of the week we can put out to our constituents, these are the banks participating and talking to the city of Seattle to help small businesses and Renters and mortgage holders, et cetera.",82,,
515,0.97,4288.35,4290.252,Do you think that is a reality?,82,,
516,0.97,4290.252,4291.086,"Yes, I do.",83,,
517,0.97,4291.086,4293.856,I think that would be great.,83,,
518,0.97,4293.856,4296.392,California did that in a nice way.,83,,
519,0.97,4296.392,4320.416,"They have a listing with all the things that the banks have agreed to on the Website clearly listed, and then another page where they show the financial institutions that participating broken down by major institutions, state chartered banks and credit unions, et cetera, and that's a great way to be supportive.",83,,

546,0.97,4553.448,4570.165,"I also want to make NOTE as I think we all know, we have received the unfortunate news that the state Supreme Court declined to review the ruling on the tax on high income.",90,,

626,0.97,5334.929,5349.21,"I am in favor of adding this to the legislation and referral calendar but as Council President, I believe it would be appropriate to refer it to either the budget committee or Finance and housing committee.",95,,
627,0.97,5349.21,5363.291,I had an community to directly community with Councilmember Sawant about my desire to see this go to either of the two committees with the preference for the budget committee.,95,,
628,0.97,5363.291,5375.436,I think I wanted to take a quick moment to communicate with all of you in the Council briefing today what I communicated in terms of my rationale for doing so.,95,,
629,0.97,5375.436,5406.768,"Again, as I mentioned in March I directly Communitied with Councilmember Sawant if the legislation went through the ordinary referral process I choose to refer her and Councilmember Morales's communication including my rationale for that referral and, again, I would like to share that really quickly with each of you.",95,,
630,0.97,5406.768,5431.025,"I indicated to Councilmember Sawant, I would refer this legislation to the budget committee rather than the Finance and housing committee since she is not a member of the committee and Councilmember is only an alternate.",95,,
631,0.97,5431.025,5440.301,It's typical for sponsors of committees to have their legislation referred to a committee not chaired by him or her.,95,,
632,0.97,5440.301,5451.112,"When I worked together to have sponsor the progressive business tax in 2018, that was referred by Council maybe Bagshaw.",95,,
633,0.97,5451.112,5454.816,This is an all hands on deck approach.,95,,
634,0.97,5454.816,5462.857,The select budget committee including all of us includes an important structural business.,95,,
635,0.97,5462.857,5467.795,I learned how important it was from California to have on deck all 9 Councilmembers.,95,,
636,0.97,5467.795,5480.775,I believe that's true now if not more so considering that we are protected to have a $200 million deficit in the budget.,95,,
637,0.97,5480.775,5491.285,I hope we can work together as a full Council to get the best thinking on this legislation.,95,,
638,0.97,5491.285,5529.79,"Third, a lot of different aspects of Council's priorities this, legislation is that it's a revenue Billy bill--bill I believe is appropriately considered in Committee, and I mentioned that the Council approved our structure in early January, including appointing Councilmember Mosqueda, the chair of the Finance and housing committee and the budget committee to be responsible for the city's finances, including revenue legislation.",95,,
639,0.97,5529.79,5536.197,So this is why I believe it would be most appropriate to controversy to the budget committee.,95,,
640,0.97,5536.197,5562.323,"I don't think it would be appropriate to undercut Councilmember Mosqueda's role as chair at this Title, and in my conversations with Councilmember Mosqueda, I will not speak for her but I think we would give of this legislation due consideration.",95,,
641,0.97,5562.323,5571.432,I hope that my colleagues will work together with her to make sure we are facilitating an important policy discussion on the legislation.,95,,
642,0.97,5571.432,5590.518,"I know that I, like many of you, remain as committed as ever to make sure that we are finding progressive revenue solutions particularly on the heels of the ruling on the Supreme Court on Councilmember Herbold's Legislature on the next tax.",95,,
643,0.97,5590.518,5607.902,I want to again urge my colleagues to join me this afternoon supporting a motion too add this legislation to the calendar and refer the legislation to the select budget committee.,95,,
644,0.97,5607.902,5608.402,Councilmember Sawant?,95,,
645,0.97,5608.402,5616.277,"Thank you, and in keeping with your comments, I just wanted to solidify my possession.",96,,
646,0.97,5616.277,5634.128,"First of all, don't agree that my request to be able to share my own legislation is in any way undercut anything Councilmember, especially Councilmember Mosqueda.",96,,
647,0.97,5634.128,5674.101,"I look forward to the response, and if our Councilmembers agree with me that the Coronavirus is a huge crisis and we should be acting boldly and Couragously, I can't imagine why the Council would not wholeheartedly support the legislation and wholeheartedly agree--I from the select committee . hear I am happy to chair that committee.",96,,
648,0.97,5674.101,5676.27,I agree that all Councilmembers should be willing.,96,,
649,0.97,5676.27,5685.88,I think that there are avenues to do this.,96,,
650,0.97,5685.88,5690.317,I think there is a deficit with the revenues going up.,96,,
651,0.97,5690.317,5699.994,I am not clear why there is a reason that we should be doing--this is actually going to undercut.,96,,
652,0.97,5699.994,5703.564,I am supporting the movement and fighting for this.,96,,
653,0.97,5703.564,5725.086,I believe that it should be a committee chaired by me or Councilmember Morales or a committee chaired by me and Councilmember Mosqueda.,96,,
654,0.97,5725.086,5744.472,"I also wanted to note in my letter to Council President Gonzalez, I have presented everything to the point that the legislation that is under question should be discussed always discussed by the committee that is relevant.",96,,
655,0.97,5744.472,5778.339,"That is not true, actually, of Council President Gonzalez herself with just one legislation, and Council President Kennedy before you--Councilmember Mosqueda said that it was a a commit--I don't see an objection.",96,,
656,0.97,5778.339,5788.849,"And I--for example, my house bill was discussed in the Committee on homelessness.",96,,
657,0.97,5788.849,5800.628,I did not object to that as much as we were creating the movement on the Council to win that legislation.,96,,
658,0.97,5800.628,5802.596,This is very different.,96,,
659,0.97,5802.596,5810.938,We are seeing push back from the Chamber of Commerce.,96,,
660,0.97,5810.938,5825.386,I really don't know how to emphasize that this legislation is over the committee of the legislation's sponsor.,96,,
661,0.97,5825.386,5831.826,I really urge that Councilmembers allow the movement to have a voice.,96,,
662,0.97,5831.826,5832.326,Thank you.,96,,
663,0.97,5832.326,5834.128,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",97,,
664,0.97,5834.128,5842.903,"I mean, I know we will debate this this afternoon.",97,,
665,0.97,5842.903,5861.021,"I don't want to Belabor the point right now and I made my point as I can, and I will be happy to expand on that this afternoon, and I hope it will be to refer the legislation to the select budget committee.",97,,
666,0.97,5861.021,5863.49,I will speak more to that this afternoon.,97,,
667,0.97,5863.49,5869.63,I don't think we need to add any more currently to the discussion.,97,,
668,0.97,5869.63,5873.868,So other--at least I don't feel like I need to add anymore.,97,,
669,0.97,5873.868,5880.507,Are there any colleagues who--who would like to speak to this issue now?,97,,
670,0.97,5880.507,5881.141,Councilmember Herbold.,97,,
671,0.97,5881.141,5890.985,"I would like to underscore a point you made, Councilmember Gonzalez.",98,,
672,0.97,5890.985,5916.577,The employee hour tax legislation that I and several other Councilmembers sponsored a couple of years ago now.,98,,
673,0.97,5917.845,5941.602,"In 2017, the city high earners' income tax sponsored by myself and Councilmember Sawant went through the Then-Finance committee chaired by Councilmember Burgess, also at the time, not a sponsor of the legislation.",98,,
674,0.97,5941.602,5950.177,"You know, Councilmember Sawant makes the distinction of this is major legislation, and we should have a different approach because it's major legislation.",98,,
675,0.97,5950.177,5971.699,I consider both of those bills that I just Referenced major legislation and if they were appropriately heard in the committee and our Council rules established proper legislation that is associated with the committee work plan that we established by our Council rules at the beginning of every year.,98,,
676,0.97,5971.699,5997.791,"If we are going to have some new set of rules for certain types of legislation sponsored by Councilmembers who may not chair the committee, I think we need to take up on deliberation of the rules and not a 1-Off basis.",98,,
677,0.97,5997.791,6001.295,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",99,,
678,0.97,6001.295,6001.795,Councilmember Sawant?,99,,
679,0.97,6001.795,6006.333,I want to clarify this is not a one off basis.,100,,
680,0.97,6006.333,6020.08,"If any Councilmembers are offended, I said, there are examples where this legislation was considered in committees that are not routinely responsible for those topics and those examples are existing.",100,,
681,0.97,6020.08,6042.002,"And I think that this is one of those cases where, even though the budget committee might have a Purview on this--I think the whole point about this legislation is it's important and affects various sectors.",100,,
682,0.97,6042.002,6054.314,I could make a powerful argument about how this legislation involves in the Sustainability and Renter's rights committee.,100,,
683,0.97,6054.314,6076.437,"Ultimately again, I wanted to Clair that a committee chaired by me is not based on those details about this committee discussing the work stoppage but more for the movement to have a real voice, I failed to understand why the Council supports this major legislation.",100,,
684,0.97,6076.437,6086.513,"If you are in agreement--you all say repeatedly we are in agreement to do this, I don't understand why there would be an objection.",100,,
685,0.97,6086.513,6095.456,And the committee would incorporate all 9 Councilmembers and I would be happy to Co-Chair and not chair exclusively.,100,,
686,0.97,6095.456,6109.937,I would like to clarify there is no reason yet Chamber of Commerce did not come in on the coalition task force.,100,,
687,0.97,6109.937,6128.322,"It's because they knew that the legislation would get stuck in the Supreme Court and I promise you the courts cleared the way for it, the Chamber of Commerce would land like a ton of bricks against this how this would be a bad idea.",100,,
688,0.97,6128.322,6143.704,The reason we will see a different situation here just as we saw during the Amazon decision in 2018 is that it's completely legal.,100,,
689,0.97,6143.704,6146.673,It would go into effect immediately.,100,,
690,0.97,6146.673,6155.048,"That is why big business, the wealthy, the Chamber of Commerce, they are already gearing up for a major fight.",100,,
691,0.97,6155.048,6160.988,I don't believe this can be won without the voice of the movement.,100,,
692,0.97,6160.988,6169.263,And that's the argument I am making and I will reiterate that in the Council meeting this afternoon.,100,,
693,0.97,6169.263,6170.764,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",101,,
694,0.97,6170.764,6174.635,Any other questions before we move along?,101,,
695,0.97,6174.635,6182.409,"Hearing and seeing none, District 4, Councilmember Pedersen.",101,,
696,0.97,6182.409,6186.113,"Good morning, colleagues.",102,,
697,0.97,6186.113,6187.414,Is it still morning?,102,,
698,0.97,6187.414,6188.215,Good morning.,103,,
699,0.97,6188.215,6190.784,I hope everyone is staying safe.,104,,
700,0.97,6190.784,6198.892,I want to thank the office for the briefing on the $2 trillion economic stimulus and relief package enacted by the Federal Government.,104,,
701,0.97,6198.892,6204.498,It's good to hear there will be a fourth package on the way.,104,,
702,0.97,6204.498,6214.041,Very interested in the unemployment insurance payments for the Forgivable loans in small business and 340 billion to local governments.,104,,
703,0.97,6214.041,6226.787,"As we know, the Federal Government with the national tax base and unique legal authority to spend money without balancing the budget will be a key to surviving another economic downturn.",104,,
704,0.97,6226.787,6237.13,"As transportation and utilities Committee, on this afternoon's full city council agenda, there are no items.",104,,
705,0.97,6237.13,6258.819,"Regarding bridges and the West Seattle bridge, I want to thank Council President Gonzalez for enabling us to hear the updated briefing from the Department of transportation and Councilmember Herbold's leadership and tenacity on behalf of her constituents.",104,,
706,0.97,6258.819,6270.764,We hope to schedule a return visit to the Council via Sdot at the end of this month to have more of a plan in place.,104,,
707,0.97,6270.764,6281.341,"And free parking, as you know, there was an announcement to allow free parking during the Covid crisis.",104,,
708,0.97,6281.341,6299.993,"With the need for social distancing and reduced transit, I support the Sdot's effort to allow free parking on the public streets so the workers can be where they need to be to assist Seattle during this trying time.",104,,
709,0.97,6299.993,6306.633,"This Friday, the city auditor released an audit of Seattle city light.",104,,
710,0.97,6306.633,6318.812,This performance was initiated by Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda and is found on the city auditor's Website and on my Blog and the Council connection.,104,,
711,0.97,6318.812,6336.363,That was done to try and resolve problems with high bills that customers received throughout Seattle city light when they were implementing changes to the meter system.,104,,
712,0.97,6336.363,6342.536,"Councilmember Mosqueda, if you would like to speak with this, freely fee.",104,,
713,0.97,6342.536,6348.408,"President, okay to speak on this now?",105,,
714,0.97,6348.408,6348.642,Yes.,106,,
715,0.97,6348.642,6360.887,"Councilmember Pedersen, thank you for allowing me to jump in on this movement from the auditor's office on Seattle city light.",107,,
716,0.97,6360.887,6361.955,This is an important effort.,107,,
717,0.97,6361.955,6366.293,This is the reason we have an oversight body.,107,,
718,0.97,6366.293,6399.292,"In 2018, early in the year, right after I was elected in response to a large number of calls and Emails that I got from customers who were reporting large unexpected bills and difficulty getting clear answers from the service Department, we requested an audit from the billing system, and a number of people who wrote in expressed concerns with getting bills that were $100 or $200 more than expected, some were getting calls about $1,000 more than expected.",107,,
719,0.97,6399.292,6403.897,This was a real problem that we wanted the auditors to inquire about.,107,,
720,0.97,6403.897,6413.14,So this report is in response to the audit request we submitted in 2018.,107,,
721,0.97,6413.14,6430.457,The report talked about this investigation and 17 recommendations that they came up with to decrease the number of unexpected high bills received by customers to make sure there was improved handling of customer complaints and to make sure it was clear and easy to understand for customers.,107,,
722,0.97,6430.457,6445.238,"I saw one example of an explanation that was about a 6 page Email, and to make it more easily digestible for the consumer.",107,,
723,0.97,6445.238,6458.452,We are excited to see that the lessons are already applied to create an escalation team so they are handling any of the calls coming in and making it easier for customers to set up the payment arrangements.,107,,
724,0.97,6458.452,6478.205,"Some of the work was put into place last year and under the leadership of Councilmember Pedersen, we are excited to see how the pilot projects are going into effect and help to reduce both the high number of large unexpected bills and the high anxiety that the bills are creating.",107,,
725,0.97,6478.205,6499.593,"The report found that city light's new billing system and advanced meeting resulted in customers receiving unexpected large bills and inaccurate estimates and delayed billing and once customers sought to resolve the issues, the customers were confused in the response they received and found it difficult to navigate those.",107,,
726,0.97,6499.593,6513.173,So some of the information has been changes I think in C Hange--changed in I think the Proactive movement.,107,,
727,0.97,6513.173,6530.824,"Some of the efforts again went into place basically last October or September and I think with the audit in hand, we will be able to see some of the policies if I remembered up with Councilmember Pedersen's leadership such as making sure no customers receive Shut-Off noises.",107,,
728,0.97,6530.824,6549.643,That was something we were committed to prior to Covid-19 being present in the community and the mailed noises of unpaid bills and information how to get help with paying your bills so we are not Instilling fears to customers with a Shut-Off notice.,107,,
729,0.97,6549.643,6568.728,And with the team that was up at City light to help make sure that getting into the utility discount program that I know Councilmember Herbold had a large role and hand in expanding.,107,,
730,0.97,6568.728,6592.218,"Lastly, waiving late fees for customers who make payments towards their balance much it's an important concept that other jurisdictions have taken into play, and especially as Covid- 19 is present in the community, and there is an unknown whether or not people will get their jobs back and the assistance they can get will be important.",107,,
731,0.97,6592.218,6599.793,"So thank you to Deborah Smith from Seattle city light and the city light audit team, and Mr.",107,,
732,0.97,6599.793,6600.594,Jones for their work.,107,,
733,0.97,6600.594,6602.128,They have been tremendous.,107,,
734,0.97,6602.128,6611.538,I think there are a lot more questions that I know that Councilmember Pedersen is looking forward to asking Aong with me when we resume the committees soon.,107,,
735,0.97,6611.538,6615.942,But a huge thank you to the audit team for digging into the details.,107,,
736,0.97,6615.942,6627.32,"When we started to get the calls, it was clear that there was a pattern, and the report provides a blueprint how to address large and unexpected bills.",107,,
737,0.97,6627.32,6629.923,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",107,,
738,0.97,6629.923,6632.826,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",108,,
739,0.97,6632.826,6646.206,And we will hop back to Councilmember Pedersen.,108,,
740,0.97,6646.206,6647.707,Thank you.,109,,
741,0.97,6647.707,6654.047,"So regarding gathering remotely, I had calls for several constituents.",109,,
742,0.97,6654.047,6663.423,"Please sign up on Seattle.Gov/Council, and you can find all the Councilmembers there.",109,,
743,0.97,6663.423,6686.98,"Regarding regional committee activity, last week I participated in two regional transportation meetings, the Seattle shoreline transportation form and King County transportation policy board with leaders throughout the region where we collaborated and proposals to the grant competition which will be decided by the Puget sound regional Council.",109,,
744,0.97,6686.98,6697.19,I was proud to stand with Councilmember Gonzalez to support the research and recommendations of the city Department of transportation.,109,,
745,0.97,6697.19,6704.097,"And a final NOTE from me, regarding full council items.",109,,
746,0.97,6704.097,6721.247,"I just wanted to put out a concern or a request that as our teams of analysts work remotely, we are trying to avoid over working them as they Coke focus on Coronavirus legislation.",109,,
747,0.97,6721.247,6729.689,I ask that they be given a couple of weeks to review the routine legislation that is unrelated to Coronavirus.,109,,
748,0.97,6729.689,6738.631,"As we know, they would normally be Vetted by PBT matter where the issues would be identified and questions answered and amendments drafted.",109,,
749,0.97,6738.631,6743.002,So having the extra time to the full Council of at least 2 weeks would be helpful.,109,,
750,0.97,6743.002,6748.408,I am just putting that out as an idea.,109,,
751,0.97,6748.408,6748.842,Thank you.,109,,
752,0.97,6748.842,6749.008,Is.,109,,
753,0.97,6749.008,6750.21,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",110,,
754,0.97,6750.21,6768.428,We will follow up with you on the request of having a little more breathing room to Digest and take a look at the legislation that appears on the introduction and referral calendar.,110,,
755,0.97,6768.428,6782.208,"Routine legislation isn't particularly controversial but I can appreciate that sometimes, some issues that are Non-Covid related will pop up that might send up a flag.",110,,
756,0.97,6782.208,6808.101,"Let's stay in communication how we can best facilitate a quality review of things that appear on the introduction and referral calendar so as we are working remotely, folks don't feel like they are being jammed in terms of making a quick decision on the legislation they are seeing for the first time.",110,,
757,0.97,6808.101,6809.402,Councilmember Herbold?,110,,
758,0.97,6809.402,6832.125,"To track the requests from Councilmember Pedersen in light of the expectation out of the governor's office about what we are hearing during this crisis, I was under the impression that we aren't closings hearings on legislation.",111,,
759,0.97,6832.125,6834.327,Am I Overstating that?,111,,
760,0.97,6834.327,6838.598,Are we allowed to hear necessary and controversial legislation?,111,,
761,0.97,6838.598,6848.374,So there are two a respects to the governor's proclamations as to how we comply with the open policy.,112,,
762,0.97,6848.374,6859.586,"During the period of, we have orders or he has prohibited the public from gathering.",112,,

911,0.97,8257.949,8294.152,We were making sure that the 5- cent fee was not passed on but it was appreciated how quickly that they came to the conversations around the impact of this potential guidance that was having on front line workers who are in a tough position being stressed and we don't want to discourage anyone from getting the groceries they need whether because of financial concerns or the added stress of being in the Check- out line and having another fee imposed.,121,,
912,0.97,8294.152,8297.589,"I really appreciate the quick leadership, especially Mr.",121,,

941,0.97,8606.631,8631.289,"We want the Renters to stay in place without the income coming in, and putting a moratorium on foreclosures especially for the larger and smaller multifamily structures can help to protect the Renters.",121,,
942,0.97,8631.289,8645.169,I appreciate the governor's office notifying us that the letter would be well received and they are working on a handful of policy items to prevent the foreclosures for the structures and small landlords.,121,,

953,0.97,8727.385,8727.585,Okay.,122,,
954,0.97,8727.585,8735.093,So I will go ahead and move quickly through my report because we are running extremely long.,122,,
955,0.97,8735.093,8740.331,We do not have any updates on the agenda.,122,,
956,0.97,8740.331,8744.102,And our regularly scheduled hearings are canceled.,122,,
957,0.97,8744.102,8750.308,We have two items on the introduction and referral calendar.,122,,
958,0.97,8750.308,8753.311,They are Council bill 119770 and 119771.,122,,
959,0.97,8753.311,8765.256,Both of the bills are technical changes and responsive to city operations related to Covid-19 and the response.,122,,
960,0.97,8765.256,8771.496,"The first bill, council bill 119770 is by request of the hearing Examiner.",122,,
961,0.97,8771.496,8787.812,This legislation will temporarily suspend deadlines set in the Seattle municipal code and temporarily Supercede a few sections of the Seattle municipal code because it impacts the ability to conduct hearings.,122,,
962,0.97,8787.812,8809.033,"So this legislation is Neats--necessary to allow the hearing Examiner, in order to allow the office to effectively put a--put a hold or a hiatus on In- person hearings.",122,,
963,0.97,8809.033,8824.916,So this legislation is important to making sure that everyone is right and the hearing Examiner's office will be preserved during the crisis and recognizes that the hearing Examiner's office follows the health order.,122,,
964,0.97,8824.916,8837.828,And this is an important piece of legislation to administer in the most responsible way during this cries.,122,,
965,0.97,8837.828,8859.951,"The second bill is 119771, this legislation will amend the family's education, preschool levy plan to have include emergency front line child care in the order issued on March 27.",123,,
966,0.97,8859.951,8867.325,The services will be considered a Sub-Service during the period of time of crisis.,123,,
967,0.97,8867.325,8885.977,"There are specific limitations as to how the dollars can be used in the Mayor's emergency order which was circulated last week, and I solicited objections to or potential amendments to the emergency order and received none in response.",123,,
968,0.97,8885.977,8899.824,We will follow through on the central staff analysis to allow that emergency order related to emergency child care for essential workers to go through as proposed by the Mayor.,123,,
969,0.97,8899.824,8923.581,So this particular bill effectively makes sure that we are being transparent in the fact that we are utilizing these dollars in the way that is consistent with voter intent as it relates to the family education and preschool promise levy.,123,,
970,0.97,8923.581,8929.32,That will be specifically related with the Covid-19 response.,123,,

979,0.97,8967.525,8977.068,This is an emergency bill which would limit rent increases for small businesses and non-profit Tennants and require payment plans for overdue rent.,124,,
980,0.97,8977.068,8985.776,The plan is to bring the bill to full Council on April 13th.,124,,

985,0.97,9062.153,9096.921,Myself and Council special staff met with the ACLU and Columbia legal serves and the urban League last week to talk more about our collective interest in providing guidance to King County jail for future reductions in the jail population and looking to get information about the practices in the jail currently both for hygiene and to replace some of the programming.,124,,
986,0.97,9096.921,9102.76,"People aren't--the programs have been suspended, and people are not allowed visitors.",124,,
