57,0.97,364.23,371.304,I chose this proclamation honoring the life and legacy of Scott morrow who tragically passed away on April 19th.,28,,
58,0.97,371.304,383.149,"Scott was an activist and Organizer in Seattle working for decades to help our homeless neighbors organize to fight for shelter, housing and for their community.",28,,
59,0.97,383.149,403.469,He helped fund share in 1990 and tiny House religious and shelters across King County and are democratically Self-Run by their residents.,28,,
60,0.97,403.469,412.879,Earl Campbell wrote a piece about Scott morrow and it's available on social media.,28,,
61,0.97,412.879,415.114,Somehow Scott did this work for most of his life.,28,,
62,0.97,415.114,425.758,The fact that densities are part of the landscape of Seattle can largely be attributed to Scott's ability to empower homeless people and his ability to live up to his commitments.,28,,
63,0.97,425.758,436.269,"Scott called me one Saturday and said, that the Nicholas community needed a place to stay and asked if they could stay at Keystone United Church of Christ my church.",28,,
64,0.97,436.269,442.575,Another place had fallen through at the last minute and this community of homeless people needed some place to stay in two days.,28,,
65,0.97,442.575,445.411,"On Sunday, Scott came with a group.",28,,
66,0.97,445.411,447.18,They made their presentation.,28,,
67,0.97,447.18,459.358,Scott was largely silent when church leaders gathered to decide whether to open our sanctuary.,28,,
68,0.97,459.358,463.129,I told them I was complete faith in Scott.,28,,
69,0.97,463.129,474.04,If a group he worked with made a commitment they would maintain that commitment.,28,,
70,0.97,474.04,484.584,And they left Keystone better than before.,28,,
71,0.97,484.584,491.157,My proclamation is to honor Scott.,28,,
72,0.97,491.157,503.636,Do we have any comments from Council members before we do the roll call.,29,,
73,0.97,503.636,514.113,Council member Herbold.,30,,

75,0.97,520.286,523.656,"Thank you, any other comments.",32,,
76,0.97,523.656,523.99,Seeing none.,32,,
77,0.97,523.99,532.532,"Clerk would you please call the roll to making Sunday May 15, 2022 Scott morrow day.",32,,
78,0.97,532.532,534.066,Council member Nelson.,33,,

85,0.97,551.384,552.952,Council member Protemp Lewis.,40,,

91,0.97,572.371,575.341,Excuse me Council Protem Lewis.,44,,
92,0.97,575.341,588.054,Can we get you to Revisit approval of th minutes That'Sitem one.,44,,
93,0.97,588.054,600.533,"I already read the minutes, but I can do it again.",45,,
94,0.97,600.533,600.8,Okay.,46,,
95,0.97,600.8,604.57,I must have missed it ..,46,,
96,0.97,604.57,605.972,I can do it again.,46,,
97,0.97,605.972,607.773,No we trust you.,47,,
98,0.97,607.773,611.477,Thank you for making sure I did that.,48,,
99,0.97,611.477,628.361,We will begin the discussion as per our well established tradition of rotating roll call which is designated Alphabetically by last name and with the Council President called last.,48,,
100,0.97,628.361,632.999,This week's call begins with Council member Nelson.,48,,
101,0.97,632.999,654.653,I will bring up that Councilpresident Mosqueda and Council so just remember that when we're making the call.,48,,
102,0.97,654.653,659.358,"Council member Nelson, you are recognized.",48,,
103,0.97,659.358,661.06,Thank you Council Presidentprotem Lewis.,49,,
104,0.97,661.06,671.037,There are no items from tomorrow's agenda from the technology and city light committee.,49,,
105,0.97,671.037,676.475,So I will move on to next week.,49,,
106,0.97,676.475,683.315,The increasingly staffing shortage was discussed at the city committee.,49,,
107,0.97,683.315,688.087,I have spoken many times about the city crisis that led me to put forward this resolution.,49,,
108,0.97,688.087,692.825,Now I would like to explain why I'm doing a resolution instead of an Ordnance.,49,,
109,0.97,692.825,701.534,And I'm responding here to a question Council member Herbold asked in committee.,49,,
110,0.97,701.534,706.405,Referencing her draft proposal she said this is a Council bill so it would be implemented.,49,,
111,0.97,706.405,708.974,In contrast to a resolution that holds intend.,49,,
112,0.97,708.974,713.612,Why not vote to act rather than voting on intent.,49,,
113,0.97,713.612,714.313,Here's why.,49,,
114,0.97,714.313,726.859,Resolutions are statements of Council's policy intent often on Council issues that we plan to take up by separate Ordnance on a later date.,49,,
115,0.97,726.859,735.568,Just like resolution 31999 for allocating Federal Covid relief funding from last year.,49,,
116,0.97,735.568,744.643,"More importantly, resolutions provide a Venue for Articulating and debating our policy positions in the public eye.",49,,
117,0.97,744.643,754.019,Which is especially valuable on controversial solutions when and if Deliberating on the future Ordnance will be determined by a separate legislative process.,49,,
118,0.97,754.019,759.992,And I'm not budget chair.,49,,
119,0.97,759.992,780.012,I assume that lifting the budget reprisal would be a budget action that had to take place during the process where we just are adopted 2022 budget which back in the day happened in May which is a long way off when I started talking about this in February.,49,,
120,0.97,780.012,789.321,"So in short, passing this resolution is the best way to have an impact on our public safety crisis while still respecting Council's procedures.",49,,
121,0.97,789.321,794.026,Now I knew this would be controversial given Council's past actions.,49,,
122,0.97,794.026,802.635,I thought maybe the alarm we were hearing from our constituents and the barrage of media reports on repeated shootings might have caused a change of mind.,49,,
123,0.97,802.635,811.544,In last year's elections were proof that voters could support a change in direction on public policy on public safety.,49,,
124,0.97,811.544,818.384,And I felt strongly most of all that we had to answer to our constituents and show that we were doing something.,49,,
125,0.97,818.384,831.096,And to signal to the people that might be interested in a career in law enforcement at Seattle would find this a welcoming environment to apply.,49,,
126,0.97,831.096,842.508,I didn't see our Finance chair or our public safety chair addressing or indicating future work on addressing the SPD staffing shortage.,49,,
127,0.97,842.508,850.282,So I was advised to put forward a resolution stating our support for incentives which was the first step.,49,,
128,0.97,850.282,851.35,Because we had to get.,49,,
129,0.97,851.35,854.854,Because we had to get there first.,49,,
130,0.97,854.854,870.135,And then stating our intent to lift the budget reprisal by separate Ordnance because that would set the stage for a rich policy discussion over the course of several weeks once it went on the public Preintroduction calendar.,49,,
131,0.97,870.135,879.879,"Now, we could talk about our differences of opinion and allow constituents to weigh in and I thought that was important.",49,,
132,0.97,879.879,884.416,Erring on the side of transparency was the right thing to do.,49,,
133,0.97,884.416,895.527,"So, bottom line if Council passed my resolution, then we could move fairly quickly on to lifting or modifying the budget reprisal.",49,,
134,0.97,895.527,908.54,"And we would approve the specifics of the incentive program, I mean the incentive program via separate Ordnance as well pretty much in tandem with that action.",49,,
135,0.97,908.54,924.623,"So, and if Council rejected the resolution then fine, no need to spend time lifting the budget and debating what would be the specifics of the incentive program.",49,,
136,0.97,924.623,940.973,So I wanted this resolution in my committee because I knew that public safety committee would be full with pay up legislation and related pieces of legislation for a couple of months.,49,,
137,0.97,940.973,943.642,And so I released it.,49,,
138,0.97,943.642,952.651,"But before doing so, I in the spirit of collaboration asked Council member Herbold to cosponsor the bill.",49,,
139,0.97,952.651,963.162,And I also told Council member Mosqueda that I was planning on doing this and that I would respect her work in the budget process when the time came.,49,,
140,0.97,963.162,968.5,"So that is pretty much, that was the thinking behind what I was doing.",49,,
141,0.97,968.5,977.843,And for the record I want everyone to know that I didn't do any of this before getting the green light from the executive.,49,,
142,0.97,977.843,993.158,"First I asked Council, I mean first I asked Herald to see if he thought this was all right and he said yes.",49,,
143,0.97,993.158,1004.403,"Then I called the police Chiefabout that time Tacoma announced a $25,000 hiring bonus for lateral hires.",49,,
144,0.97,1004.403,1021.086,So I had a long talk also with senior deputy Mayor Herald so if they didn't have a plan to issue another executive order or legislation to establish the staffing incentive program that I would take the lead on it.,49,,
145,0.97,1021.086,1024.356,And I got her permission to go forward and lead on this process.,49,,
146,0.97,1024.356,1031.63,"And so, and I did all of this because the way I saw it, SPD is their Department but it's our checkbook.",49,,
147,0.97,1031.63,1044.943,And I wouldn't bother trying to make these funds available for incentive s incentives if I didn't want it.,49,,
148,0.97,1044.943,1047.346,So that is what was on my mind.,49,,
149,0.97,1047.346,1064.897,I hope I answered questions about why I'm doing this as a resolution and I'm looking forward to the second discussion on the May 10th committee and possible vote out of committee and welcoming our colleagues formerly into the broader conversation when we voted at of full council.,49,,
150,0.97,1064.897,1073.906,So that is that and I would like to talk more about some of the things that happened last week.,49,,
151,0.97,1073.906,1082.247,I participated along the forum along with Council Memberherbold and captain Rivera.,49,,
152,0.97,1082.247,1088.554,We heard more about district one and as we hear in every district when I attend meetings elsewhere.,49,,
153,0.97,1088.554,1096.061,So we need action and more officers right now was the message we were hearing.,49,,
154,0.97,1096.061,1106.705,I participated in the coalition to end gender violence Fundraiser on Thursday night.,49,,
155,0.97,1106.705,1114.713,And the Vietnamese communities 47Th Commemoration of April 30th day event at the West Seattle Vietnamese culture center.,49,,
156,0.97,1114.713,1119.485,"So looking into next week which is, mind Boggling it's already May.",49,,
157,0.97,1119.485,1130.929,My staff will be attending the central Puget sound economic board meeting on my behalf because that's one of my external committees that will also take place during the housing and Finance Committee.,49,,
158,0.97,1130.929,1132.698,Of which I'm a member.,49,,
159,0.97,1132.698,1137.536,Fun things I get to tour two Seattle Icons next week.,49,,
160,0.97,1137.536,1146.311,The Seattle Monorail and the woodland park zoo where I've been promised I could see some some baby animals.,49,,
161,0.97,1146.311,1148.814,While these tours are to be honest a lot of fun.,49,,
162,0.97,1148.814,1170.102,"As economic development chair it is also critical to engage with our partners who continue to bringing tourism to this region and the Monorail and the zoo do draw a lot of visitors regionally, statewide and from out of the country.",49,,
163,0.97,1170.102,1175.073,I will be attending the 13th annual Cinco de Mayo reception.,49,,
164,0.97,1175.073,1187.753,And I'm very excited that the National small business week is now currently upon us and that our proclamation will be formally passed tomorrow.,49,,
165,0.97,1187.753,1207.339,"And as I said, there will be an event later in the week where the proclamation will be presented to Michael Fong and there will be opportunities for speeches from the Mayor and also interim director of Oed mark Mcintire.",49,,

292,0.97,2043.174,2049.714,This is a Council appointment that comes recommended by the community police Commission themselves.,53,,
293,0.97,2049.714,2058.923,So that will be on the full council agenda tomorrow afternoon from the public safety and human crisis committee.,53,,

301,0.97,2108.539,2117.548,An unusual mismatch between the timing of the full Council and Amoving of committees.,53,,
302,0.97,2117.548,2127.091,That means introduction and referral are voted on the Tuesday afternoon meeting that the Tuesday afternoon full council meeting actually follows our committee meeting.,53,,
303,0.97,2127.091,2134.098,"So there's a one week delay between introduction, referral and Committee recommendation.",53,,
304,0.97,2134.098,2142.473,Other communities that meet on Wednesday or Thursday can keep their legislation referred on the day's committee meeting.,53,,
305,0.97,2142.473,2153.918,"So with meeting, moving full council meetings on Tuesday it does create some unique logistical challenges for the Tuesday meeting.",53,,
306,0.97,2153.918,2160.791,I want to flag that for the RIC coming up.,53,,
307,0.97,2160.791,2161.092,What else?,53,,

325,0.97,2313.644,2317.682,Previously being trespassed from one of the retail operations.,53,,
326,0.97,2317.682,2346.711,I think this is another sort of important way to under score the importance of using the retail theft that we heard from SPD to present on that program and how that works in our Committee a couple of months ago.,53,,

341,0.97,2467.031,2472.636,And I had several meetings with Southwest precinct Captainrivera.,53,,
342,0.97,2472.636,2500.731,"This week I'll be joining an energy, environment and land use caucus of the 34Th and 33Rd Democrats and I also will be attending on Wednesday Navas changing minds events which RAISES awareness, critical treatment research for children and adults with mental abuse disorders.",53,,
343,0.97,2500.731,2504.468,Navas does great work in district one.,53,,
344,0.97,2504.468,2507.671,I am happy to be able to honor that work.,53,,
345,0.97,2507.671,2515.579,And there will be an introduction of the Atlantictreatment center.,53,,
346,0.97,2515.579,2519.25,That's all I have for today.,53,,
347,0.97,2519.25,2525.689,Any questions from the Council president and my colleagues?,53,,
348,0.97,2525.689,2526.19,Council member Nelson.,53,,
349,0.97,2526.19,2528.726,So I believe we need to play by the rules.,54,,
350,0.97,2528.726,2538.068,I would like to hear your reasons for what I see Disrespecting our Council President by walking on your Council bill tomorrow.,54,,
351,0.97,2538.068,2546.31,Because under normal procedure and I have a map of the legislation intake and review calendar it's about three weeks long.,54,,
352,0.97,2546.31,2560.624,"Under normal procedure in this case, the earliest date for the inclusion of either one of our Council bills, on the introduction and referral calendar would be at the full council meeting on May 10th.",54,,
353,0.97,2560.624,2573.938,"And that gives the, and there is that gap of time because it gives the President time to think about what committee legislation should be referred to.",54,,
354,0.97,2573.938,2585.082,And also Ideally work out any potential conflicts with potentially dueling pieces of legislation.,54,,
355,0.97,2585.082,2592.389,So I understand that you asked Council President Juarez to expedite getting your bill on to this week's IRC and she declined.,54,,
356,0.97,2592.389,2602.733,So now you're making us vote on doing an around Council President when she's not even here to vote on it herself.,54,,
357,0.97,2602.733,2604.635,So why would we do that.,54,,
358,0.97,2604.635,2607.071,I think it was explained pretty thoroughly.,55,,
359,0.97,2607.071,2616.38,The gap that makes it impossible for anybody having a Tuesday meeting to hear legislation.,55,,
360,0.97,2616.38,2618.816,We essentially have an extra week from our colleagues.,55,,
361,0.97,2618.816,2625.889,Those of us who have meetings on Tuesday mornings.,55,,
362,0.97,2625.889,2630.094,"Well, because she declined, out of respect for Council President Juarez.",56,,
363,0.97,2630.094,2635.165,Can we wait until she returns to clear up this confusion?,56,,
364,0.97,2635.165,2649.146,Because rushing this legislation through without going through the proper channels I believe is bad Governance.,56,,
365,0.97,2649.146,2661.191,In good Governance the rules matter.,56,,
366,0.97,2661.191,2678.942,"And when I first saw your Council bill, I had serious concerns so I put together a list that provides flexibility for the amount of money at a $4.4 million that can be spent on them.",56,,
367,0.97,2678.942,2686.116,But you did not allow me to talk about my bill in your Committee.,56,,
368,0.97,2686.116,2691.755,And Ideally we would follow our procedures to allow our time Preintroduction to maybe work together.,56,,
369,0.97,2691.755,2694.324,Along with the executive to find a compromise.,56,,
370,0.97,2694.324,2705.536,So that we can avoid the confusing situation of dueling bills doing the same thing or allow for discussion over the course of two Council meetings.,56,,
371,0.97,2705.536,2707.771,To debate possible amendments to your bill.,56,,
372,0.97,2707.771,2713.544,Now I'm not led to having my name on a piece of legislation as a primary sponsor.,56,,
373,0.97,2713.544,2715.946,I just want to make sure that we do this right.,56,,
374,0.97,2715.946,2723.42,So that we end up with the most competitive incentive program.,56,,
375,0.97,2723.42,2729.059,Possible to attract qualified candidates and recruit supply for a job in our police Department.,56,,
376,0.97,2729.059,2734.598,"So in case you're wondering, I'm not planning on walking on my Council bill.",56,,
377,0.97,2734.598,2742.706,Ultimately we need to get this right and I'm worried about inconsistencies here.,56,,
378,0.97,2742.706,2753.484,"So, that is why I Proport an alternative piece of legislation.",56,,
379,0.97,2753.484,2755.219,And you didn't allow me to talk about it.,56,,
380,0.97,2755.219,2760.791,I didn't learn about it until we were 40 minutes into a 60 minute discussion that was scheduled for 30 minutes.,57,,
381,0.97,2760.791,2765.395,The only bill of yours that I was aware of was the resolution.,57,,
382,0.97,2765.395,2773.27,And that you also had a Council bill again 45 minutes into the 60 minute discussion in committee.,57,,
383,0.97,2773.27,2777.274,All right in response to that.,58,,
384,0.97,2777.274,2780.878,"Colleagues just, council member Nelson just for a moment.",59,,
385,0.97,2780.878,2793.557,Since this will be something that will be Procedurally discussed tomorrow I would rather we not have a debate right now in Council briefing about this matter which will be on the agenda tomorrow.,59,,
386,0.97,2793.557,2807.004,Council members of course are always fully empowered to vote for or at least a procedural thing for any reason that they see prudent and share with colleagues why that is.,59,,
387,0.97,2807.004,2812.643,And everyone should certainly do that tomorrow when this matter comes up for consideration.,59,,
388,0.97,2812.643,2817.948,So I would just like to rather than start debating that matter now.,59,,
389,0.97,2817.948,2841.872,Maybe see if there's any final points of clarification or procedural questions about how that will be Cued up tomorrow for Council member Herbold and leave the arguments about the merits of walking it on for that agenda item on Tuesday.,59,,
390,0.97,2841.872,2842.372,Fair enough.,60,,
391,0.97,2842.372,2853.05,Kay if that's the case can we move on in the order to Council member Morales.,61,,
392,0.97,2853.05,2857.12,I'm not seeing any further questions.,62,,
393,0.97,2857.12,2859.556,"I do see a raised hand, I assume that's a carry over.",62,,
394,0.97,2859.556,2860.757,Yeah that's a carry over.,63,,
395,0.97,2860.757,2865.529,With that I will send it over to Council member Morales.,64,,
396,0.97,2865.529,2868.298,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",65,,
397,0.97,2868.298,2876.473,Let's see at the last meeting of the neighborhood education arts and civil rights Committee on April 22nd.,65,,
398,0.97,2876.473,2886.75,"We approved two appointments for the Seattle arts Commission, two for the levee oversight committee and one for the International special district, special review district board.",65,,
399,0.97,2886.75,2893.257,These will all be on the consent agenda for tomorrow's full council meeting.,65,,
400,0.97,2893.257,2896.326,We also passed two landmark preservation Ordnances.,65,,
401,0.97,2896.326,2903.3,One was for the center for women votes and the other for the Wagner floating home historic Houseboat on Lake Union.,65,,
402,0.97,2903.3,2908.305,These will also be on a full council agenda for tomorrow.,65,,
403,0.97,2908.305,2918.715,"At the last committee meeting, we also did have preservation request for controls and incentives request for the Seattle first National Bank.",65,,
404,0.97,2918.715,2926.189,"I did request that we hold that piece of legislation, because I needed to get more information on the controls and incentives.",65,,
405,0.97,2926.189,2935.666,I will be bringing that back to the May 13th meeting which is my next meeting.,65,,
406,0.97,2935.666,2950.947,"Also on the 13th we'll have the first of two confirmation discussions for the appointment of director Muhammad for the office of immigration, immigrant and refugee fairs.",65,,

413,0.97,3006.67,3009.339,So that is committee stuff.,65,,
414,0.97,3009.339,3017.347,"Last week, in terms of external committees I attended the King County planning Council.",65,,
415,0.97,3017.347,3031.027,"For your information, later this year, the affordable housing committee of that Council which does include Council member Mosqueda and our office of housing director, Michael Wingler Chen.",65,,
416,0.97,3031.027,3050.947,That committee will be recommending to the Griff planning Council on accountability and around the county relating to affordable housing.,65,,
417,0.97,3050.947,3064.161,The city of Seattle has been supportive of these efforts to increase local accountability in planning for and achieving affordable housing options in jurisdictions across the county.,65,,
418,0.97,3064.161,3078.909,"So Prs staff will continue to monitor that and to support this process for developing this frame work and then later this year, the Griff management planning Council will be asked to vote on that accountability frame work.",65,,

478,0.97,3517.48,3524.921,Not all public meeting and study rooms are going to be immediately open.,66,,
479,0.97,3524.921,3528.458,As Seattle public libraries continues to transition back to make them available.,66,,

494,0.97,3684.047,3693.322,Not not seeing any.,66,,
495,0.97,3693.322,3701.931,With that that concludes,66,,
