55,0.97,454.62,464.831,"In 2016, the city adopted a budget with a line-item Avenue $75,000 to help a planning group to come together around the AIDS legacy and Memorial.",22,,
56,0.97,464.831,489.322,"Through that line item, we worked with private consultants and we worked with the Museum of history and industry and a number of other community members to scope scale locations, purpose and the Timeline of this project . a community advisory group was brought together and we worked with them to identify a site.",22,,
57,0.97,489.322,497.029,That site is at the northern end of Cal Anderson park on the link light where all station.,22,,
58,0.97,497.029,517.583,"We have begun a relationship with the develop for who has been an eager participant in the project . through further allocation in city funding in 2018, the office of arts and culture in Seattle parks and Rec were able to dedicate funding to the AIDS Memorial Pathway arts plan.",22,,
59,0.97,517.583,529.362,We commissioned a plan for the overall project spanning public and private property . that plan was funded through city funding and private fundraising of the independent group.,22,,
60,0.97,529.362,571.437,"And then, as a continuation of that plan, we have been able to Commission artists to develop Artworks that will go on to the property in accordance with the master art plan . Today we are here to seek your approval to seek funds that have been raised privately into the city to do the fabrication and installation of those Artworks into accept the Artworks into the city civic collection . I think this is a unique partnership and not one we have entered to before . We are responsive to community members coming forward and saying this is important and how we Prioritize making this happen.",22,,
61,0.97,571.437,578.044,The community did independent fundraising which we are able to leverage as a city.,22,,
62,0.97,578.044,580.146,I will turn it over to Jason.,22,,
63,0.97,580.146,602.868,"Okay, I will give an overview of the project . I know some of you have heard this before . As mentioned, the project is due to complete and this year, 2020 and the location is over the light rail station at the northern end of the park.",23,,
64,0.97,602.868,614.447,"It has been several years, a few years the committee has worked together and some of the steering committee is in the audience today.",23,,
65,0.97,614.447,635.668,We have some here today to cheer us on . The committee that was formed did a search for the appropriate location and this was the area that happened to work out . being at the heart of Capitol Hill was great because it provides a deep cultural and historical connection.,23,,
66,0.97,635.668,647.113,This neighborhood has a history of being a center for the Lgbt community and was the locus of the county AIDS epidemic.,23,,
67,0.97,647.113,699.365,"They developed three goals and funding was worked both Collaboratively with government and private donations . The three goals are to create a physical place for reflection and remembrance and to utilize technology to share stories about the epidemic and to call for action to end aids, HIV and the stigma . one of the components that we will talk more about with the physical locations and I also want to mention the story collection goal has been happening over two years now . Roselle has been leading the efforts to collect recordings from people in the community around their experiences with HIV and AIDS and developing a picture of the history that we have experienced in this region.",23,,
68,0.97,699.365,719.452,"The stories will be sold share not only through our Website, but through a Digital component as well . It is so people will have access to a variety of means . are we able to go to the Video now?",23,,
69,0.97,719.452,728.294,"Okay, let's do that . Actually, let's have Rosette talk a little bit about the story collection and we can share some of that.",23,,
70,0.97,728.294,776.942,"Sure . So I have been working for two years about now and my job has two phases . The first phase was funded by a grant from the Department of neighborhoods for the matching fund grant and that was to collect stories from black and Brown people talking about HIV and AIDS and how it impacted their lives in the region . I ended up speaking with 25-26 individuals and got 60 hours or so of material . really moving, compelling, heartbreaking and hard to lifting stories about HIV and aids in the region . It was really a beautiful work.",24,,
71,0.97,776.942,813.679,"Now we are moving to phase 2, we will be working with Bracken black and Brown communities as well as immigrant communities and Asl communities and Trans- communities and hoping to Reframe the narrative by speaking to white women about how HIV and aids has impacted their lives . lesbians working with man during the early days of the epidemic . casting a wide and broad tapestry of all different voices giving us this wonderful story . A moving and truthful story about HIV and aids in the region.",24,,
72,0.97,813.679,835.034,That is one part of the AIDS Memorial Pathway . I've spoken to a lot of people and we will show three minutes or so of some of the people who have spoken with over the past years.,24,,
73,0.97,835.701,886.585,We will definitely play that in the panel discussion afterwards.,25,,
74,0.97,886.585,915.881,"Yeah, it has really been a fantastic work and it has been wonderful to work with people in the city and to have support for a project like this . When I tell people that it happens, I think half of the people are shocked . really, you're getting money from the city? It's so great to do a project like that.",26,,
75,0.97,915.881,933.098,To know the city supports elevating the voices of all people with something that will be around and have permanence in the city . It is important to many people who feel often overlooked and have to deal with stigma on a day-to-day basis.,26,,
76,0.97,933.098,937.603,It has been great.,26,,
77,0.97,937.603,941.607,The fact that people are still in healing was the thing that was really apparent to me.,27,,
78,0.97,941.607,946.578,In the presentation that I was able to view.,27,,
79,0.97,946.578,962.795,"It is not just about what happened, it is about what people are living with still today . that's why I think it is important to incorporate these stories into this physical art work.",27,,
80,0.97,962.795,971.136,I think it really brings that home to people when they are experiencing the physical art.,27,,
81,0.97,971.136,979.044,"Yeah, it's not just the past, but our present . It also asks us how we will deal with our future together as people.",28,,
82,0.97,979.044,982.514,Right.,29,,
83,0.97,982.514,992.324,Eric is going to make the magic happen.,30,,
84,0.97,992.324,1001.767,[Laughter].,31,,
85,0.97,1024.623,1032.865,"Jason, would you like to speak and then we will come back to that?",32,,
86,0.97,1032.865,1039.371,"Yeah, I can do that.",33,,
87,0.97,1039.371,1041.306,Should we just go back to the Powerpoint?,34,,
88,0.97,1041.306,1044.676,"Yeah, I will go back to the Powerpoint and we can try to play this later.",35,,
89,0.97,1044.676,1052.785,"Not right now, but we will share it with everyone so you can see it later.",36,,
90,0.97,1052.785,1053.419,Thank you.,37,,
91,0.97,1053.419,1063.529,We have a link to this on our Youtube.,38,,
92,0.97,1063.529,1066.532,You can go right now.,39,,
93,0.97,1066.532,1070.202,Okay.,40,,
94,0.97,1070.202,1110.075,"So in terms of the way this will work in the public art are Progrm and what this Council bill 119739 will allow almost 750 thousand dollars . Those funds are being split into what will be executed through three contracts to the artists who have been chosen to install the artwork this year . So, three artists are Christopher Jordan who is planned to design the Centerpice artwork which I'm sure you have more information about.",41,,
95,0.97,1110.075,1123.255,There are Artworks connecting the different areas of the installation and ultimately a contract to design artwork for the tower on the Plaza and that will go to Horatio.,41,,
96,0.97,1123.255,1126.291,Do you want to do the master our plan?,41,,
97,0.97,1126.291,1153.018,"I can if you want . that was a great summary, thank you so much . What you are referring to was laid out in the master art plan in 2018 and completed in 2019 that lays out the physical location of the places where the pieces will go . The total project is $2.9 million and we have raised $2.4 million currently.",42,,
98,0.97,1153.018,1170.869,"The aspects of the amp, there are three major segments of the project century Non-Remembrance and reflection and celebrating creativity and life and honoring courage and resilience and it's connected to those aspects.",42,,
99,0.97,1170.869,1177.342,This is a recent great overview of the project.,42,,
100,0.97,1177.342,1179.945,There will be four distinct arts zones through this space.,42,,
101,0.97,1179.945,1196.161,The center was just mentioned by Christopher Paul Jordan . The connecting artwork that you see in the center and to the left are designed by civilization.,42,,
102,0.97,1196.161,1234.766,The community room artwork will be in a private space in the Capitol Hill housing building but visible to John Street because the room is all windows on the street side . and then the artwork on the northeast edge of the park here . You can see three different stations that were proposed and recently were passed through the public advisory art committee . Those three pieces there . So the amp has done a lot to work with the office of arts and culture to select these artists and select the commissions and go through the design phase.,42,,
103,0.97,1234.766,1240.672,Now we are ready for the city to take over with installation and eventually accept it to the collection.,42,,
104,0.97,1240.672,1254.086,"And just to clarify, the community room is not one that will come into the city's collection because it is a private space.",43,,
105,0.97,1254.086,1257.489,We were focusing on the ones that were publicly accessible for the art program.,43,,
106,0.97,1257.489,1257.923,Exactly.,44,,
107,0.97,1257.923,1261.627,I just mentioned we were at the end of the design phase for a lot of these pieces.,44,,
108,0.97,1261.627,1298.23,"The first Commission artists was the centerpiece artwork and this is an image of that artwork to help by Christopher Paul Jordan . There is an artist statement that the piece is not going into too much detail but it is basically a positive sign on its side . In some ways it is to dispel the dichotomy of HIV positive and negative as being separate and really recognize that once a person is infected with HIV and aids, we all are and we all have to deal with the epidemic.",44,,
109,0.97,1298.23,1307.439,The X symbol has meanings for love and a symbol of the unknown and things we are not supposed to speak about in public.,44,,
110,0.97,1307.439,1317.482,The sculpture is talking about galvanizing ongoing action and referred to space as connecting across time.,44,,
111,0.97,1317.482,1340.005,"As a young black artist, the statement ends with a note that in a country where 50% of black men are projected to become Hiv- positive in their lifetime, the Speaker calls into connection, care, activism and support.",44,,
112,0.97,1340.005,1383.849,You can see a little bit of other pieces that have been suggested for the Plaza as well with the connecting art pieces using protest signs as an explicit connection to the history of HIV and AIDS . and this slide is here to show we have been doing a lot of work in the last couple of years to engage multiple artists . We had temporary Artworks that did partnership with the office of arts and culture to engage the area in different communities using different art forms rather than just sculptural public art . There was some graphic design elements that were performance elements with dance performances that were used throughout the area to connect with folks to let them know about the Amp.,44,,
113,0.97,1383.849,1392.457,Thank you . I have so many more questions.,45,,
114,0.97,1392.457,1406.271,"As someone who is on the board of health, just that last Statistic with 50% of men anticipating to become Hiv- positive is feeling like something that is preventable.",45,,
115,0.97,1406.271,1411.877,This is an important part of understanding the message that there is work to do to keep people protected as well.,45,,
116,0.97,1411.877,1414.146,That's one thing the Artworks are doing.,46,,
117,0.97,1414.146,1428.794,"Not only talking about the past, but maintaining a visible presence in reminding people that HIV is present and that people can do things to stop it themselves.",46,,
118,0.97,1428.794,1435.0,It is a call to action to be there and be a presence in the city which was why I think it is important.,46,,
119,0.97,1435.0,1436.535,Councilmember.,47,,
120,0.97,1436.535,1451.95,"Thank you for your presentation and for previous presentations . One question I had was, how much do you see the AIDS Memorial project connected to the current?",48,,
121,0.97,1451.95,1456.454,"I'm just testing the Video, I'm sorry.",49,,
122,0.97,1456.454,1461.827,I will finish asking my question.,50,,
123,0.97,1461.827,1493.925,"Obviously, as you correctly said and as chair member morale is pointed out, it is about the struggle community members are experiencing and that it connects to the present day as well . expanding that a little, how Muchwill this connect to people's thinking about the overall health care needs experienced by the community?",50,,
124,0.97,1493.925,1507.372,Especially today what is prominent is the Healthcare needs of the Trans community and access to medication and procedures that are affordable.,50,,
125,0.97,1507.372,1511.643,And there is a struggle at so many levels to achieve that.,50,,
126,0.97,1511.643,1528.693,And how it relates to the need for Medicare for all . Because something like Medicare for all will especially benefit the Trans community and the Lgbt community.,50,,
127,0.97,1528.693,1540.972,I don't know if we will specifically be addressing issues like that . There is partnership with those issues like talking about the realities of what folks are facing HIV today.,51,,
128,0.97,1540.972,1576.641,That is brought up in the videos being created and there is outreach to specific communities to ensure voices are heard and that multiple perspectives are included . One components of the amp is working with an augmented reality and extended reality overlay . We feel that is a great component to the physical Artworks to allow people to access the physical information . with your phone you may have an interactive experience with the artwork and there may be a link to find out more through one of the resource partners we have.,51,,
129,0.97,1576.641,1580.946,There is connection to that although we have not talked explicitly about a political agenda through the Memorial.,51,,
130,0.97,1580.946,1619.084,"But I think we could say we have a list of 30 some odd people we are about to approach to do more interviews for this second phase . I was just speaking to someone a couple of hours ago, a black Trans-Woman who has done decades of work around HIV and aids in the region and we were talking about Healthcare and sort of what that means for Trans communities to have access to full health care and what that would look like and how it has been an impediment for so many people like her and her life and people who look like her.",52,,
131,0.97,1619.084,1623.388,She is one of the people I am thinking of having a nice sit down with in the second phase.,52,,
132,0.97,1623.388,1624.656,I imagine those things will come up.,52,,
133,0.97,1624.656,1641.006,"What has happened so far is that sometimes an idea may be spoken by someone else but then when I sit down with someone in front of a camera, they start talking and it comes out again.",52,,
134,0.97,1641.006,1649.314,"I have a feeling this is already in the air and it is going to be voiced by certain people, even without me asking an explicit question about it.",52,,
135,0.97,1649.314,1654.419,Do you want to try the Video again?,53,,
136,0.97,1654.419,1664.696,Thank you Eric.,53,,
137,0.97,1665.797,1686.351,"I was with a so-called Boyfriend . It eventually became sexual . after the fact, he then told me, by the way . I said Yeah, he said I've got it . I've said got what?",54,,
138,0.97,1686.351,1687.552,He said I've got it.,54,,
139,0.97,1687.552,1690.555,"And I said, what is it?",54,,
140,0.97,1690.555,1694.292,"He said, I've got AIDS . I said AIDS?",54,,
141,0.97,1694.292,1701.466,"He said Yeah . I'm supposed to be Medicated, but I don't take any medication.",54,,
142,0.97,1701.466,1705.87,"I said, why didn't you tell me before?",54,,
143,0.97,1705.87,1709.674,He said come I thought you already had it.,54,,
144,0.97,1709.674,1712.343,I said why did you think I had it.,55,,
145,0.97,1712.343,1716.581,"He said, because everybody's got it.",55,,
146,0.97,1716.581,1728.76,I have to reintroduce myself to myself and reintroduce myself to people . I'm okay with getting Meds and I'm okay with letting my job this is what is going on.,56,,
147,0.97,1728.76,1732.197,I have been okay with stating that I am positive.,56,,
148,0.97,1732.197,1746.01,"In the black community, the church is it . that is the cornerstone and the place where people traditionally an historic we have gone to seek refuge and care and support.",57,,
149,0.97,1746.01,1758.022,"For people who are living with HIV and dying of AIDS, they could neither go to the church nor with the church come to them.",57,,
150,0.97,1758.022,1773.705,They couldn't stand up and publicly announce they had HIV or aids or they would be further ostracized.,58,,
151,0.97,1773.705,1774.105,Yeah.,59,,
152,0.97,1774.105,1778.343,And people died of shame.,60,,
153,0.97,1778.343,1785.45,"They could have lived, but they died of shame.",60,,
154,0.97,1785.45,1801.866,"You can live with HIV . This is not a death threat any longer . You have to love yourself, though, in order to do what you need to do . how you need to show other people where they can go.",61,,
155,0.97,1801.866,1815.713,I have been helped by so many different people since I have been Hiv-Positive that there were things they helped me with that I didn't even know I could get.,61,,
156,0.97,1815.713,1819.784,"So, I am really kind of glad.",61,,
157,0.97,1819.784,1834.098,I tell people that the Lord let me have HIV so I could help somebody else along the way.,61,,
158,0.97,1837.335,1849.214,"I do want to mention that I know this was not Captioned, but everything that's on the Website and the Youtube channel is Captioned so if people need that, they can.",62,,
159,0.97,1849.214,1853.117,"That was powerful, thank you.",63,,
160,0.97,1853.117,1869.734,"Can I ask about some of the other pieces that are here? so, going back to the monolith Serpentine at Lambda, this is part of it?",64,,
161,0.97,1869.734,1871.769,It was put forth by Horatio law.,65,,
162,0.97,1871.769,1877.308,Can you talk about what these look like? How big are they and what do the symbols mean?,66,,
163,0.97,1877.308,1886.684,"Yeah, so like I said, these were just approved and I don't have a lot of information in the Powerpoint.",67,,
164,0.97,1886.684,1911.376,"But the concept of those pieces, one of the main inspirations is a poem through a compilation of poems around HIV and aids that referred to when a friend of theirs died, it was like the sky cracked and pieces of the sky fell to the ground . using that as an analogy with these large glass pieces that have fallen into the park.",67,,
165,0.97,1911.376,1945.176,One of the shapes is a singular Shard which is a monolith at eight Feet-Nine feet tall and 24 inches wide . The second piece is described as a Serpentine shape and it is really three fragments kind of lying on their side in the park . The third one is a Lambda shape and it is these two pieces that have been broken apart but are supporting each other and holding each other up . of course there is symbolism there.,67,,
166,0.97,1945.176,1979.644,"The Lambda is a symbol used by the community many years . It's a catalyst for making positive change . There are other references to the shape as well . So, there are different meanings around that . The length of them are all about that same eight foot by 24 feet wide and 4-6 inches thick and the components . The intent is to have them eliminated from the inside so there is a glowing presence as well.",67,,
167,0.97,1979.644,1980.578,Okay.,68,,
168,0.97,1980.578,1988.82,"So, this looks very exciting . I do have a question though.",68,,
169,0.97,1988.82,1997.328,"I'm sorry, I'm trying to find my notes.",68,,
170,0.97,1997.328,2006.237,We have funding coming to the city to pay for the fabrication Úand installation but we don't see anything about the maintenance of these pieces.,68,,
171,0.97,2006.237,2012.543,Can you talk a little bit about what the anticipated operating and maintenance costs would be and for how long?,68,,
172,0.97,2012.543,2020.585,"I know there is expected contribution coming for that, but we don't have details.",68,,
173,0.97,2020.585,2028.593,Right . Thank you.,69,,
174,0.97,2028.593,2033.498,"Whenever the city ACCEPTS artwork as a gift, we look for maintenance funds because we are responsible for the maintenance and the long-term.",69,,
175,0.97,2033.498,2036.701,We look for an approximate 30 year life span of something living in the public.,69,,
176,0.97,2036.701,2069.333,We are looking at what might erode due to weather versus something that may be tagged frequently or any other Materiality that might need to be replaced that we are familiar with because we maintain other Artworks . We have an arts Conservator on staff who has looked at these specific Artworks and sort of done a projection over the next 30 years of kind of what it will take to make sure these Artworks stay looking good in the public space.,69,,
177,0.97,2069.333,2071.135,"We have estimated $400,000 for the set of three over a period of 30 years.",69,,
178,0.97,2071.135,2087.919,"So, we have an agreement that the money is part of that section which is still to be fund raised . that's why we are not bringing it forward in the legislation at this time but we anticipate it by the end of this year.",69,,
179,0.97,2087.919,2091.355,The end of this year?,70,,
180,0.97,2091.355,2093.791,"Yes, by the end of this year.",71,,
181,0.97,2093.791,2126.09,"Okay, so given that, I think what I am going to propose is that we amend this to wait until we have a little more detail on that so that we can be clear about what the parameters are on that and when the funding will come . does anybody have questions about that piece of it? the operating cost in the maintenance?",72,,
182,0.97,2126.09,2136.2,"So, the idea would be that we would not vote on the ordinance that would accept the funds?",73,,
183,0.97,2136.2,2148.813,"So, I would make a motion to amend this to accept the donation provided the execution of the contracts until we have more information about that.",74,,
184,0.97,2148.813,2152.517,Shall I just read it?,74,,
185,0.97,2152.517,2164.028,"Yes, I would feel more comfortable with that approach as opposed to the approach that would delay acting on the legislation to accept.",75,,
186,0.97,2164.028,2166.898,Let me read my proposal and then we can have a conversation.,76,,
187,0.97,2166.898,2189.453,I moved to amend Council bill 119739 pending inclusion of provisions regarding the cost overruns and the potential cost overruns and donation of funding for ongoing conservation activities or other issues Councilmembers may be interested in.,77,,
188,0.97,2189.453,2191.689,I will give you a minute to think about that.,78,,
189,0.97,2191.689,2192.924,I have a second?,78,,
190,0.97,2192.924,2193.224,Second.,79,,
191,0.97,2193.224,2195.96,"Councilmember, can I NOTE one thing?",80,,
192,0.97,2195.96,2196.827,Yes.,81,,
193,0.97,2196.827,2204.235,You have the provision with execution of the contracts.,82,,
194,0.97,2204.235,2219.984,"I just note that if I could run that language by the law Department and then have it added in when this goes to full council so we can make the amendment there because I don't have it in front of me, if that would be acceptable?",82,,
195,0.97,2219.984,2230.161,Including language like other issues makes it a provides their that may make it subject to a lot of things.,83,,
196,0.97,2230.161,2238.202,Yeah.,84,,
197,0.97,2238.202,2240.705,I can do that and circulated to you by tomorrow.,85,,
198,0.97,2240.705,2242.707,We can do that and I will withdraw the motion.,86,,
199,0.97,2242.707,2244.909,May I ask a clarifying question?,87,,
200,0.97,2244.909,2247.511,Yes.,88,,
201,0.97,2247.511,2255.486,"If we were to I have a contract with the Seattle foundation that just outlines the expectations, with that meet the needs moving forward?",89,,
202,0.97,2255.486,2267.031,I would think so . We just don't have the information about what the costs are and the expectation for when that funding would come in and the plan for maintaining these?,90,,
203,0.97,2267.031,2280.244,"We have public art all over the city and we know that maintaining that is a real thing . We want to understand exactly how that would happen . If you are able to do that, I think it would address the issue.",90,,
204,0.97,2280.244,2283.047,And a clarifying question.,91,,
205,0.97,2283.047,2291.289,Do you see that is a different amendment with these are the commitments that will be in the contract?,91,,
206,0.97,2291.289,2293.057,In the current contract?,92,,
207,0.97,2293.057,2307.672,"No, a different amendment to the ordinance from what the chair is proposing that the amendment would simply say these are the agreements we have with these other entities and those agreements will be reflected in the contract in the future?",93,,
208,0.97,2307.672,2309.14,Is that what you are talking about?,93,,
209,0.97,2309.14,2310.741,If that would be acceptable.,94,,
210,0.97,2310.741,2315.98,Man I propose something?,95,,
211,0.97,2315.98,2322.887,"If it would be feasible for you to get the Councilmembers that information between now and next week, it may not require an amendment and we can just pass the bill.",95,,
212,0.97,2322.887,2326.791,We can incorporate it that way.,96,,
213,0.97,2326.791,2333.898,"So, we will be in touch with you soon.",97,,
214,0.97,2333.898,2335.066,"That sounds good, fantastic.",98,,
215,0.97,2335.066,2338.469,"In that case, we will just move to passing the bill.",99,,
216,0.97,2338.469,2350.114,"So,, Okay, so, I'm just reading the notes.",99,,
217,0.97,2350.114,2356.62,I moved and that the committee recommend passage of Council bill 119739 . Thank you.,99,,
218,0.97,2356.62,2361.726,Those in favor say aye.,99,,
219,0.97,2361.726,2375.539,Aye . The motion carries and Council bill 119739 will be moved forward to the March 9 council meeting.,100,,
220,0.97,2375.539,2376.34,Thank you.,101,,
221,0.97,2376.34,2379.61,Thank you and we are looking forward to seeing this in the park.,102,,

226,0.97,2397.661,2418.449,"Okay, hello there . If you will come on up . Hi, how is everybody doing today?",106,,
227,0.97,2418.449,2422.453,Good.,107,,
228,0.97,2422.453,2426.657,"Welcome . So, if we could do a quick round of introductions and get started, that would be great.",107,,
229,0.97,2426.657,2427.491,Thank you.,107,,
230,0.97,2427.491,2432.396,"Robbie Lee, director of Oed.",108,,

234,0.97,2446.877,2450.681,And I am the Maritime advocate and advisor.,112,,
235,0.97,2450.681,2455.519,"Okay, go for it.",113,,
236,0.97,2455.519,2458.189,"Thank you for allowing us to be here, this is very exciting.",114,,
237,0.97,2458.189,2471.202,"As I understand it, you wanted an overall overview of our program as well as the manufacturing and Maritime insight into that particular industry.",114,,
238,0.97,2471.202,2497.761,"Sure, so we have the work that you do around workforce development . We know that there is a lot of conversation happening and really interested in understanding how we can support young people in our city and also folks in general who are unemployed or underemployed and getting access to these types of programs.",115,,
239,0.97,2497.761,2498.062,Great.,116,,
240,0.97,2498.062,2522.286,"That thesis we are trying to address is that the economy is evolving in a way where on average it looks good . the economy is booming . But, when you look at the data and break it down by race, geography and especially educational level, and there are other indicators.",116,,
241,0.97,2522.286,2531.662,"You see that as the economy is moving, poverty is going up at the same time, particularly for Underserved communities.",116,,
242,0.97,2531.662,2544.308,"The paradox, if you will where you have this Binary economy with growth and poverty growing at the same time is the paradox we are trying to solve at Oed.",116,,
243,0.97,2544.308,2566.03,"A big chunk of the effort around trying to address that is through small business technical assistance, especially those owned by people of color and immigrant populations . key industry strategies and workforce development and neighborhood economic development . You are at one of the events for the economic development yesterday.",116,,
244,0.97,2566.03,2577.341,Today the conversation is about workforce development but it serves to address this growing paradox that we are trying to address.,116,,
245,0.97,2577.341,2596.627,"So, as the economy has evolved over time and if you look at our grandparents and what the economy that they were a part of which was a production and manufacturing economy, we have evolved to a knowledge economy, especially in Seattle.",117,,
246,0.97,2596.627,2618.048,"In the knowledge economy, as you know, it requires more education if you want to thrive in that sect there . over time, if you were to compare from 2001 to 2019, you can see how demand for a college degree has escalated over time as the economy is evolving.",117,,
247,0.97,2618.048,2640.204,"If you look at the population growth in the last 10 years in Seattle which was 20%, many of the folks coming in our knowledgeable with college degrees and that contributes to this Binary economy that I talked about before.",117,,
248,0.97,2640.204,2670.834,"And if you break it down by race, you can see how in the eight years after high school graduation and the attainment of higher education . When you break it down by race, you can see attainment by race . as the economy moves more toward a Knowledge-Based economy, by race, you can see the attainment level with different groups are evolving over time.",117,,
249,0.97,2670.834,2673.303,It is contributing to this Binary economy.,117,,
250,0.97,2673.303,2695.125,"On the next slide, and this came out of a few months after I arrived here in Seattle from the Seattle times . They did this comparison and it is astounding how in one city you could have such discrepancy and income disparity based on race.",117,,
251,0.97,2695.125,2709.44,"105 and 100,000 per year for African-Americans with 4000--43,500 per year.",117,,
252,0.97,2709.44,2724.488,We predict that disparity will Unfortunately only grow . There is a variety of theories as to how and why . We won't get into that too much today because this is workforce development.,117,,
253,0.97,2724.488,2749.48,Our concern is that the paradox will be more exacerbated over time . We changed our mission at Oed and we focus on an inclusive economy . This Binary economy contributes to social ills and we need to put our resources into supporting.,117,,
254,0.97,2749.48,2754.718,"What is interesting if you look at the basic facts, and I won't go into all the details.",118,,
255,0.97,2754.718,2763.827,"Education plays a role, but people of color are being left out which is the bottom line when you look at the population.",118,,
256,0.97,2763.827,2777.908,"In summary, the health of our economy, on the average, looks remarkably positive, but underneath it all, we have serious challenges ahead of us.",118,,
257,0.97,2777.908,2784.214,"With that, I will turn it over to Nancy.",118,,
258,0.97,2784.214,2785.449,May I ask a question?,119,,
259,0.97,2785.449,2786.316,Please.,120,,
260,0.97,2786.316,2794.925,I always feel language can be really powerful and being able to describe our challenges.,121,,
261,0.97,2794.925,2799.263,Yep.,122,,
262,0.97,2799.263,2812.042,I think we should think of different language about our economy so that we can say something else Besides our economy is growing or booming.,123,,
263,0.97,2812.042,2833.163,"Something that is accurate that paints a picture because we don't have that language right now . If we don't have that language, that we don't have a way to express the problem in a way everyone can wrap their arms around and get in a position where we are Problem- solving around it.",123,,
264,0.97,2833.163,2851.782,"Really, the fact that there is this perception of a growing economy that means an economy that everyone is benefiting from . It's great you are saying we want an inclusive economy, but what we call the economy we have right now?",124,,
265,0.97,2851.782,2858.088,Is it not inclusive?,125,,
266,0.97,2858.088,2870.634,That basically describes what you are saying with this concept and the assumption that growing.,126,,
267,0.97,2870.634,2879.71,With the climate and catastrophe being called into question.,127,,
268,0.97,2879.71,2882.246,We know to constantly be growing is not sustainable.,128,,
269,0.97,2882.246,2892.756,I'm sorry I interrupted you.,128,,
270,0.97,2898.028,2903.066,"With the perspective of moving forward, a couple of points.",129,,
271,0.97,2903.066,2911.975,One is actual data . I don't disagree with you about the slide that you have there.,129,,
272,0.97,2911.975,2953.617,"I don't know where you have this from, but I'm presuming it is correct data with the 2001 jobs that require a college degree compared to the current time . I do think that we go beyond something like this to recognize that across the board, younger people, the people who are seeking jobs now or have just entered the job force, and you know what I'm getting at, they are paid less for the same work . I think that needs to be drawn out separate from the fact that if you are a Tech worker at Amazon or Google, you are getting paid good wages.",129,,
273,0.97,2953.617,2959.69,That describes a small portion of our young people.,129,,
274,0.97,2959.69,2971.501,And certainly we are also facing this problem where you have data only for Seattle and a lot of workers are pushed out of Seattle and it doesn't reflect the actual problem.,129,,
275,0.97,2971.501,2973.437,"That's not your fault, it is the data.",129,,
276,0.97,2973.437,2979.643,So many lower income people have been pushed out of the region.,129,,
277,0.97,2979.643,2991.455,"Within Seattle, even if you have a college degree, you actually may have a low-wage job and are saddled with student debt . This is an historical anomaly.",129,,
278,0.97,2991.455,3004.968,"Unfortunately the way the economy is going, the younger generation is the first generation in America's history that will be overall worse off than previous generations and I feel that should be reflected as well.",129,,
279,0.97,3004.968,3014.578,"And can I say, and I know this may sound--I'm not sure myself whether we should do anything about this or not.",129,,
280,0.97,3014.578,3026.49,You feel that sometimes it actually does not help the cause of having an inclusive economy if we characterize manufacturing jobs as not knowledge to base?,129,,
281,0.97,3026.49,3047.477,"I really do think that as a lot of people have been saying recently, low-paid jobs or the jobs called low skill are not low skill, they are low pay.",129,,
282,0.97,3047.477,3054.418,"There is a differential and we are not trying to pretend all work is the same and requires the same intellectual challenges and all of that, but there are other challenges.",129,,
283,0.97,3054.418,3068.999,"When you talk to workers at Macy's, for example, they are not writing code for software, but nonetheless it is challenging because there are other challenges such as patience and physical stamina to be on your feet all day.",129,,
284,0.97,3068.999,3075.338,The challenge of having the emotional response regardless of the interactions.,129,,
285,0.97,3075.338,3083.213,All of that for the service sector workers waiting tables.,129,,
286,0.97,3083.213,3090.454,I just want to make sure we don't unwittingly have sort of a lower sort of viewpoint about them?,129,,
287,0.97,3090.454,3093.957,Thank you very much.,130,,
288,0.97,3093.957,3101.665,"As a former waitress and Bra size are at a department store, I can tell you it is not easy work.",131,,
289,0.97,3101.665,3102.365,Thank you.,132,,
290,0.97,3102.365,3104.968,I agree with what you are saying.,132,,
291,0.97,3104.968,3110.44,Should I go ahead?,133,,
292,0.97,3110.44,3110.774,Yes.,134,,
293,0.97,3110.774,3122.486,Thank you for the opportunity to talk about the workforce development programs and hopefully our presentation will address some of the questions and issues you bring up today.,135,,
294,0.97,3122.486,3125.021,We want to give you an overview of the workforce Developmnt program.,135,,
295,0.97,3125.021,3136.366,"There is a team of three, myself as the workforce development advisor and Sasha is the youth advisor.",135,,
296,0.97,3136.366,3165.896,"We connect residents, particularly low income and Underrepresented residence to the economy . So, we think about economy in a neutral way . It really is about where is the labor market demand and making sure residents are connected to jobs in the community . As part of our work, we do partnership with Oed's key industry teams where we focus on the sectors.",135,,
297,0.97,3165.896,3183.647,We do a lot of work with our regional partners as well as our city partners and doing a lot of work coordinating effort across the city . We will go into a little more around those details.,135,,
298,0.97,3183.647,3188.485,"When we think about our workforce priorities for 2020, we think about it in two different categories.",135,,
299,0.97,3188.485,3225.989,"One is centered around youth and the other centered around adults . for the youth portfolio, our objective is to make sure young people in the city have what we call a window into our economy so they understand where the opportunities are and how their educational experience is relevant to those jobs . Sasha will talk a little bit more about the strategies in those areas . in the adult space, we are focused on continuing to invest in education and training for communities that are particularly Underrepresented in our economy.",135,,
300,0.97,3225.989,3233.496,And who need additional skills and training to be able to connect to our economy.,135,,
301,0.97,3233.496,3261.524,Particularly in the key sectors where there is growing demand as well as opportunity for family wage jobs . These priorities include investments in organizations like the Ingersoll gender center and the jobs initiative that supports job seekers . We have partnership with the Seattle colleges to improve access and completion rates amongst our low-wage working adults.,135,,
302,0.97,3261.524,3274.771,"Thirdly, we do a lot of work with business and labor around joint training strategies . with that, I'm going to turn it over to Sasha to talk more about the youth employment strategies.",135,,
303,0.97,3274.771,3320.25,"Thank you . As Nancy mentioned, are you strategies focus on current connected learning which is to provide more opportunities for young people to access career experiences that range from exposure to meeting people that look like them and informational interviews and net working and job shadows and Internships all the way up to apprenticeships and entering the labor market . We know most young people are exposed to jobs they see around them like their families and teachers but we want to make sure all young people have the opportunities, information and access to explore the careers that interest them so they know how to prepare for them.",136,,
304,0.97,3320.25,3322.519,What classes to take at what Afterschool opportunities to pursue.,136,,
305,0.97,3322.519,3323.987,It may not be college for everyone.,136,,
306,0.97,3323.987,3331.594,"In 2019, we launched our first connected to learning grant.",136,,
307,0.97,3331.594,3338.702,This strategy really came out of that Toolkit.,136,,
308,0.97,3338.702,3357.854,Oed used to run a massive Internship program but we heard from communities and young people that they are on a spectrum of readiness and some are not ready for Internships or they don't know what Internship they want to pursue and they need more exposure or practice talking to professionals.,136,,
309,0.97,3357.854,3367.731,And a lot of employers are on the same path and not all are ready to work with interns or host young people . We work with employers to help them get ready to take on young people.,136,,
310,0.97,3367.731,3389.119,We funded nine organizations and two projects at the Seattle public schools and one at Seattle colleges and others at partners like the Vietnamese Association and goodwill . We expect to serve about 700 young people through that and we don't have all the data yet.,136,,
311,0.97,3389.119,3396.826,"The project spanned from last summer and some are aligned to the school year . We can get back to you on the final numbers, but we believe it will be about 700.",136,,
312,0.97,3396.826,3432.729,"The priority for our grants are to serve youth of color, low income youth, immigrants, refugees, youth experiencing Holiness homelessness and Lgbtq . In talking to the providers and the young people, what was really great is the opportunities were proposed by communities.",136,,
313,0.97,3435.865,3441.104,"Instead of the city saying, this makes sense for you, they worked with employers and young people and that was evident in the proposals we received.",136,,
314,0.97,3441.104,3446.476,They really spanned the spectrum of what would work for the people and it fit the needs of what young people were experiencing in the moment.,136,,
315,0.97,3446.476,3450.513,We are also Partnering with the Mayor's office and colleges with the connected Internship opportunities.,136,,
316,0.97,3450.513,3460.023,"In the past, Oed has done work with partnerships and Internships and we are working to expand the opportunity.",136,,
317,0.97,3460.023,3462.826,You can you talk about how and where the Internships are paid?,137,,
318,0.97,3462.826,3463.626,They are all paid.,138,,
319,0.97,3463.626,3480.31,The Seattle promise jobs are paid by the employer and at the minimum wage that the employer is paying . or they can use a Stipend or additional funding to cover that.,138,,
320,0.97,3480.31,3490.753,"For this program, is this external to the city opportunities, or is this thinking",139,,
321,0.97,3490.753,3492.121,This is external to the city.,140,,
322,0.97,3492.121,3492.922,Thank you.,141,,
323,0.97,3492.922,3493.923,How many employers are participating?,141,,
324,0.97,3493.923,3499.395,That's a good question . I don't know off the top of my head and I think last year we had 7-10 employers.,142,,
325,0.97,3499.395,3502.365,This year the goal is 50.,142,,
326,0.97,3502.365,3526.823,"Yeah, I mean I know that the office of economic development has put time and effort into trying to cultivate those employer opportunities . can you talk a little bit about how you see that work happening in moving forward?",143,,
327,0.97,3526.823,3534.297,I know you touched upon it with the workforce priorities and that it is a priority to increase participation.,143,,
328,0.97,3534.297,3537.8,"Yeah, so I can touch on that in the next slide, actually.",144,,
329,0.97,3537.8,3541.271,There are a couple of different ways we engage with employers.,144,,
330,0.97,3541.271,3560.39,"One I want to mention, before I forget, is that we partner and fund some organizations providing equity training for employers so they are ready to host young people that may not traditionally work in their Pathway.",144,,
331,0.97,3560.39,3580.276,That is important for us to cultivate and work with employers who are ready . We partner with key industry employers and we are investing in different sector based organizations who have relationships with those employer communities so they can do employer recruitment and employer training on behalf of that.,144,,
332,0.97,3580.276,3583.513,We are Partnering with our friends for arts for the creative and cultural Internship program.,144,,
333,0.97,3583.513,3596.626,We have Northwest Folklife during recruitment and building for the young people and placing young people and Internships.,144,,
334,0.97,3596.626,3606.169,"I remember the small business advisory Council was Tasked with identifying things the city could do to help employers take more interns, is that what you are talking about?",145,,
335,0.97,3606.169,3622.685,Yeah . small businesses and Nonprofits are in area where we really love to place young people at because of the small experiences where young people can get a lot of hands-on work.,146,,
336,0.97,3622.685,3630.86,"But, with small businesses, we know the cost is hard and the time it takes . It's not just the cost of hiring an intern, but supervising and coming up with the tasks.",146,,
337,0.97,3630.86,3642.005,Some of our partners cover the wages for the small businesses and other partners to increase that.,146,,
338,0.97,3642.005,3645.541,We have heard that Internships are little harder for small business and they are looking for full-time employment.,146,,
339,0.97,3645.541,3657.487,We are trying to come up with strategies and work with them to connect with them to the training providers in that specific area.,146,,
340,0.97,3657.487,3661.758,I think it is key to connect them with the folks doing the training to connect them with the pipeline.,147,,
341,0.97,3661.758,3668.131,I think I am the last council member on the Council now who participated in the visit to Hamburg.,147,,
342,0.97,3668.131,3675.938,"Every employer, even Sole- source employers use interns because it is just part of what they do.",147,,
343,0.97,3675.938,3687.316,"They all see it as useful, regardless of the sector they are in . It is useful to create that job readiness.",147,,
344,0.97,3687.316,3689.652,They see it in their own best interest.,147,,
345,0.97,3689.652,3709.872,Absolutely . We try to partner with small business with job shadows and tours so young people know it is an option for them when they are ready . Perhaps one day starting their own small business . We want to expose them to that.,148,,
346,0.97,3709.872,3713.276,"It may not be there talent tomorrow or in a year, but it may be in five years.",148,,
347,0.97,3713.276,3721.284,"That's right, you hit that right on the nail.",149,,
348,0.97,3721.284,3723.486,67% of interns eventually become full-time workers for their boss.,149,,
349,0.97,3723.486,3736.466,"It is a pipeline strategy and people find the Statistics to be surprising, but that's a national figure we used to justify our investments and Internships . The second part is a broader strategic question.",149,,
350,0.97,3736.466,3746.409,That is that we need to be intentional about now in the Seattle public school system that the minorities are the majorities now.,149,,
351,0.97,3746.409,3754.45,"So, in a workplace environment, we really have to make it inclusive, otherwise the experience can BACKFIRE.",149,,
352,0.97,3754.45,3773.636,"So, we want to be much more intentional about working with employers to make sure the workplace environment is culturally acceptable and appropriate . So, that is a big part of our priority.",149,,
353,0.97,3773.636,3775.838,"In the second thing is, and this is a broader strategy.",149,,
354,0.97,3775.838,3785.214,"If we don't find a way for the first future emerging workforce which is more diverse, to be part of the middle class, then we won't have an economy.",149,,
355,0.97,3785.214,3798.828,"We have a big Mac wrote issue we are trying to address with a little bit of money that Sasha is running with . at a broader level, that is the issue for me at Oed.",149,,
356,0.97,3798.828,3799.462,"Yeah, thank you.",150,,
357,0.97,3799.462,3804.934,Thank you for that.,151,,
358,0.97,3804.934,3809.572,"Before we move on, can I ask one more question?",152,,
359,0.97,3809.572,3809.839,Sure.,153,,
360,0.97,3809.839,3829.859,"So, there are a bunch of folks in South Park who are working with the port on developing sort of a, I wouldn't call it a skill center, it is more of an alternative school . It is specifically for the Maritime industry . It looks like this thing is moving.",154,,
361,0.97,3829.859,3836.199,What can Oed do to help in that endeavor?,154,,
362,0.97,3836.199,3846.642,You are getting Sarah really excited now . She spent all night trying to answer that question.,155,,
363,0.97,3846.642,3850.446,Do you mind if we just finish up Nancy's part because Sarah will talk about that in a second.,155,,
364,0.97,3850.446,3871.934,"Before we get there, my name is matt Houghton and I am working with adults . There is overlap at times, but it is good to think about the main differences that adults do not have with the time necessary to explore careers.",156,,
365,0.97,3871.934,3888.217,Time is the enemy of the poor and they need training to become relevant in the label labor market . What is the least amount a person can learn to be valuable to an employer and a growth industry?,156,,
366,0.97,3888.217,3894.457,"That is the overall strategy, building the on ramps into growth industry's.",156,,
367,0.97,3894.457,3902.431,That requires partnerships with the employer to make sure they have Wraparound services and that the training is relevant to the employer.,156,,
368,0.97,3902.431,3918.281,If I could dive down . I love that picture . This is a program called grow hire.,156,,
369,0.97,3918.281,3925.187,We are working with the Seattle jobs initiative right now in a partnership with Swedish . The first three cohorts were just for Swedish.,156,,
370,0.97,3925.187,3935.998,"What this looks like is 60 participants have gone through this so far and for most of these people, is their first job in the country.",156,,
371,0.97,3935.998,3945.074,They go through a four week training intensive than they get jobs at entry level in the hospitals . mostly had Swedish right now.,156,,
372,0.97,3945.074,3976.539,"Let me back up . almost all of these individuals get employed out the door . Then, they are represented and they become part of the Healthcare training Fund . They are represented, but they don't be come eligible for one year . We are working with the training fund to research what happens during that year and how we can increase retention so they are represented and can actually get the benefits.",156,,
373,0.97,3976.539,3978.974,The last Cohort yesterday was awesome.,156,,
374,0.97,3978.974,4002.365,A full class and it was Kaiser too who wanted in on the action . These are individuals who would not have been able to navigate getting the job and who you talk to and how you do the Digital application . We package that for them and we are looking forward to growing this and Operationalizing this for the employers.,156,,
375,0.97,4002.365,4005.434,And that is called grow higher?,157,,
376,0.97,4005.434,4009.672,It is called grow hire.,158,,
377,0.97,4009.672,4011.24,And its focused on Healthcare?,159,,
378,0.97,4011.24,4014.744,That particular sect there.,160,,
379,0.97,4014.744,4027.99,All workforce development was about just giving somebody a job and see you later . We want to ensure that if they get into a job that it is part of a growth career that will give and if it's an a living wage.,160,,
380,0.97,4027.99,4042.405,"It's a lot harder to do . What has made it more difficult is that as Seattle becomes more exclusive, the people who can afford to leave have left . We are working with people who have more barriers than before.",160,,
381,0.97,4042.405,4054.717,This is at a time when education is more and more expensive and there are a lot of things working against us to get the people the skills they need to be active participants.,160,,
382,0.97,4054.717,4067.329,Another project I want to mention is the Ironworkers Pre- apprenticeship . There is recruitment and Wraparound for apprentices interested in becoming Ironworkers.,160,,
383,0.97,4067.329,4068.898,This is in partnership with the Ironworkers Union.,160,,
384,0.97,4068.898,4099.061,These are individuals and 30 individuals have gone through the apprenticeship and they are trained at the North Seattle colleges apprenticeship training program . They have more barrier than an average Pre-Apprenticeship but the success rate is higher by about 7% . The Ironworkers are excited about this and they run a Cohort every month out of North Seattle college and it's pretty exciting.,160,,
385,0.97,4099.061,4100.262,What is that called?,161,,
386,0.97,4100.262,4103.933,It is the Ironworkers Pre- apprenticeship.,162,,
387,0.97,4103.933,4113.242,And the other one I want to mention is a growing apprenticeship with the millionaires club.,163,,
388,0.97,4113.242,4114.443,Are you familiar with that?,163,,
389,0.97,4114.443,4123.185,It is a drop in value for homeless individuals whose first job is usually in House cleaning up and serving food.,164,,
390,0.97,4123.185,4140.903,Their next job would be day labor and that's about as far as services have gone historically . They are working with the jobs initiative to think about the career path after day labor and they call it the stage III career path.,164,,
391,0.97,4140.903,4142.905,What is that next step so they can start working?,164,,
392,0.97,4142.905,4167.696,"And there are a number of other programs we are working in . given the limited time, we also do things around program support . Bobby was mentioning the changing economy and we didn't get to mention much about the next economy when 5G happens and the network economy takes place . right now Digital literacy is already a basic skill.",165,,
393,0.97,4167.696,4169.932,It's not just about math and what you can read or right.,165,,
394,0.97,4169.932,4178.073,"If you don't have Digital literacy, you are not going to succeed . We have started a partnership with Seattle public libraries and the work source system.",165,,
395,0.97,4178.073,4182.344,And Dhs and immigrant affairs.,165,,
396,0.97,4182.344,4195.324,And do it with their Digital equity group . What we are trying to do is standardized a Digital literacy assessment.,165,,
397,0.97,4195.324,4214.31,Seattle colleges are there as well . We look at the Digital assessment to make sure we get the person to the right level of intervention to help increase their literacy . It would be a Pre-And post assessment and it is a very tactical outcome we are looking for.,165,,
398,0.97,4214.31,4220.282,"Really, the intent is to start understanding each other's operations.",165,,
399,0.97,4220.282,4237.166,"These are all Drop-In Milieux that operate for each of these organizations . We want to over time have more of a collective effort to make sure people get the right level of service . I can go on and there are other programs, but I will leave it at that.",165,,
400,0.97,4237.166,4265.694,"I don't know if you are the right person or not, but when we are the right person and talking about Pre- apprenticeship programs, one thing we have talked about in our office, and I don't know how to make this happen . We have talked about Hamburg and in European countries where this is just part of the culture to have this entry route starting with younger people . So we have the running start program in this city, for example.",166,,
401,0.97,4265.694,4295.224,"How do we take that model and help people connect who are Juniors or seniors in high school into a Pre- apprenticeship program and create this expectation? If you think that college is not your path that you have another option to think about that sooner so there is something interesting and future looking for you? so, that is Somethig.",166,,
402,0.97,4295.224,4313.342,Absolutely . One thing to consider in Europe is another difference is that between 60% and 70% of the public education system is funded by the private sector.,167,,
403,0.97,4313.342,4314.81,We don't have that level of influence here.,167,,
404,0.97,4314.81,4316.779,"So, that was built into their culture 200 years ago.",167,,
405,0.97,4316.779,4326.755,We are always trying to leverage public and private training partnerships . I continue research we did on that to figure out what is the sweet spot to make that happen.,167,,
406,0.97,4326.755,4343.605,The tipping point between the payoff for the private sector where they don't have to do as much recruitment and to get higher retention rates with quality students or Trainees who are trained in the public sector.,167,,
407,0.97,4343.605,4355.517,We have never really gotten that to a huge scale . So grow hire is a good example . Our goal is to Operationalize that so that the hospital is actually the one paying for that service.,167,,
408,0.97,4355.517,4358.42,They are getting their.,167,,
409,0.97,4358.42,4386.048,"It would be good also to maybe focus on industries that most likely would be drawing talent from places outside of Seattle . If you focus on this model on the industries that are not necessarily hiring people from here, but that we have a lot of people moving here to take.",168,,
410,0.97,4386.048,4386.482,Exactly.,169,,
411,0.97,4386.482,4407.169,I think it is useful in dealing with some of the macro issues that the director identified in dealing with our economy . We have a lot of people who are ready to learn high wage jobs and moving to the city and pushing out people who are not ready.,170,,
412,0.97,4407.169,4407.569,Exactly.,171,,
413,0.97,4407.569,4410.272,To focus on those industries.,172,,
414,0.97,4410.272,4422.117,"I mean Healthcare is great that way . The Ceo of Swedish and the Ceo of Kaiser have both said, we need to make sure the community as part of our workforce.",173,,
415,0.97,4422.117,4422.985,They are actually stepping up.,173,,
416,0.97,4422.985,4439.501,You are right . generally when people say they want jobs and there is a policy for job creation and the jobs go to Out- Of-State people because there are no training dollars to make sure the people who live here get the skills they need.,173,,
417,0.97,4439.501,4448.21,"That's the missing and ingredient . If there is not investment in the skill development, you won't get the people who live here.",173,,
418,0.97,4448.21,4450.279,It's not just about job creation.,173,,
419,0.97,4450.279,4452.314,Saucer wanted to say something.,174,,
420,0.97,4452.314,4464.76,"Yeah . one of the grants we funded this year was to the Seattle colleges and they were doing trade events and the last one was at Georgetown, South Seattle college.",175,,
421,0.97,4464.76,4475.237,80 young people went to it.,175,,
422,0.97,4480.609,4510.372,We want to explore the opportunities they have for youth apprenticeships and Pre- apprenticeships . and then there was that initiative that we are aligning our grant to . The last piece and that continuum is called career launch and it is Mimicking apprenticeships with aligned classroom training and work experience and employment partners articulated with college credit . There is a push for more programs like that across the sectors and not just skilled trades.,175,,
423,0.97,4510.372,4520.883,"In 2020, we will use the same language and encourage that . We have apprenticeships that they Seattle schools this year.",175,,
424,0.97,4520.883,4526.989,I would love to talk with you about how the people in our high schools learn about this opportunity.,176,,
425,0.97,4526.989,4575.537,"We do want to talk about the sector work to touch on the Councilmember's point . before we do that, I want to talk about the efforts to build regional alignment around workforce development . In addition to the direct program investments, we coordinate with other Stakeholders including King County and the port of Seattle and the workforce development Council and the local workforce to investment board around strategies to create a stronger and more responsive system so that we are better aligned to the needs of Jobseekers with employers and so that we can address systemic equity gaps and benefits with services.",177,,
426,0.97,4575.537,4577.839,This has been a multiyear effort that centered around four goals.,177,,
427,0.97,4577.839,4585.948,One is establishing a strong workforce development strategy and plan and we are on barking on that this year.,177,,
428,0.97,4585.948,4625.287,"I think it goes to Councilmember Herbold's point about how we work around workforce development . We often talk about it in a deficit based way which is not the way to engage the people we want to support as well as employers . Secondly, we are working to create a strong back bone entity to coordinate regional effort and to address systemic needs required in the system . that includes needs around common data and performance measures.",177,,
429,0.97,4625.287,4628.09,Creating funds and program alignment to scale the workforce services received by residents.,177,,
430,0.97,4628.09,4659.321,"The third is to ensure that community has an ongoing leadership role and a voice in the design and implementation of workforce development strategies . that also provides real-time feedback on performance . rather than a one- time engagement, really thinking about the structures for ongoing participation and leadership in the system . and definitely creating and coordinating industry including business and labor around participating in the workforce development system.",177,,
431,0.97,4659.321,4677.139,"So, turning to a little more time talking about the health care sector because it has been such an important focal point for us and for this regional partnership.",178,,
432,0.97,4677.139,4678.94,We established a Healthcare leadership industry table this year.,178,,
433,0.97,4678.94,4696.258,"That was to have leaders in the industry coalesce around joint action . So, one of the needs they identified was the gap in knowledge for young people in our community around the opportunity for Healthcare careers.",178,,
434,0.97,4696.258,4717.746,It was called a chart your path to Healthcare career event where over 450 middle and high school students attended . They were able to talk to Healthcare practitioners in the field and also learn about the education and career pathways available to help them meet their goals.,178,,
435,0.97,4717.746,4723.051,There was such excitement and interest in this that we have been asked to host two more events.,178,,
436,0.97,4723.051,4723.885,That's great.,179,,
437,0.97,4723.885,4730.959,And the leadership table provides a forum for sharing best practices.,180,,
438,0.97,4730.959,4747.409,One is the Kaiser Permanente apprenticeship program that launched last year which provides apprenticeships with the opportunity to earn and learn at the same time.,180,,
439,0.97,4747.409,4759.387,That LOWERS barriers for access for those who are unable to participate in traditional training pathways.,180,,
440,0.97,4759.387,4772.801,"So, the goal for this year is to identify two additional leadership tables . We haven't identified what sectors those will be in.",181,,
441,0.97,4772.801,4780.542,We do know we want to make sure there is a strong commitment to hiring locally and that there is a good Pathway to family wage jobs.,181,,
442,0.97,4780.542,4791.453,"So, we also develop and implement strategies to develop individuals in key sectors.",182,,
443,0.97,4791.453,4803.765,There are certain key sectors in our community important to our region both in terms of our continued economic growth as well as a long history and identity tied to the region.,182,,
444,0.97,4803.765,4818.28,Most importantly to create opportunities for family wage jobs . These are supported by Oed staff members as part of the key industry teams.,182,,
445,0.97,4818.28,4822.317,"Because workforce development is key across the sectors, we partner closely and developing workforce development strategies.",182,,
446,0.97,4822.317,4840.869,"So, the first sector is the creative and network economy . I don't know Bobby if you want to say anything there . We kind of went through your slides.",182,,
447,0.97,4840.869,4857.786,This is anticipating with the modernization of the Telecommunication system that ai and other automation will continue to play a bigger role and we are targeting sectors that allow people to thrive in the economy without being replaced by machines.,183,,
448,0.97,4857.786,4859.321,That is one sector we are focused on.,183,,
449,0.97,4859.321,4875.971,And some of the strategies being developed are the creative economy and youth pilots that we are launching in the arts as well as the Digital skills assessment partnership that we are forming with the Seattle public libraries.,184,,
450,0.97,4875.971,4905.767,Another area where we focus is in media where we have a staff person very much focused and on impact hiring and how to diversify the industry . We are also looking at how the technological advances in transportation and Electrification will have workforce implications and how we can start building a workforce that will be ready to take advantage of those occupations.,184,,
451,0.97,4905.767,4928.223,"Finally, we have our industrial and Maritime sectors which Sarah is here to talk Aboutpubl around that.",184,,
452,0.97,4928.223,4933.929,I'm going to talk more with Sarah.,184,,
453,0.97,4933.929,4935.53,Sarah is new to O.E.D.,185,,
454,0.97,4935.53,4940.168,Can you give a little more background to members?,185,,
455,0.97,4940.168,4940.602,Sure.,186,,
456,0.97,4940.602,4946.107,I have been in the Maritime industry for 30-Some-Odd years.,186,,
457,0.97,4946.107,4962.757,"And have everything from sales to work and safety to doing quality management my last four years, I was the dean of the Seattle Maritime Academy.",186,,
458,0.97,4962.757,4966.761,"So I worked with Seattle colleges, creating pathways.",186,,
459,0.97,4966.761,4973.735,"In fact, I actually started the youth Maritime collaborative with the support and collaboration of the port of Seattle.",186,,
460,0.97,4973.735,4974.302,Thank you.,187,,
461,0.97,4974.302,4984.679,"We wanted to give you a little bit of a deep dive into one of our key industries, which is manufacturing and Maritime.",188,,
462,0.97,4984.679,4997.559,"Just one of the things that you guys have talked about and that we find is that people just don't know that these industries exist, and that there's fantastic Living-Wage jobs that have low barriers to entry.",188,,
463,0.97,4997.559,5006.534,"So a little bit, just--this is just from Soto.",188,,
464,0.97,5006.534,5013.942,"And from Destillerries that are making single-malt Whiskeys Torgs solstice, which is Cannabis.",188,,
465,0.97,5013.942,5020.915,"In Soto alone, there are over 50 Cannabis companies.",188,,
466,0.97,5020.915,5021.416,There's Philson.,188,,
467,0.97,5021.416,5023.785,Which is clothing and rugged gear.,188,,
468,0.97,5023.785,5026.054,They were founded in 1897.,188,,
469,0.97,5026.054,5030.158,And they supplied clothes for the gold rush.,188,,
470,0.97,5030.158,5033.495,There's a neon company that started in 2004.,188,,
471,0.97,5033.495,5042.437,And they do everything from regular neon signs to public art to interior signs and exterior signs.,188,,
472,0.97,5042.437,5048.276,And the owner now realized that there's no one teaching this skill.,188,,
473,0.97,5048.276,5053.681,So he's actually created his own neon Sign-Training program.,188,,
474,0.97,5053.681,5057.519,So that he can have his own Pathway.,188,,
475,0.97,5057.519,5063.425,"And that's, you know, just that creative nature of a manufacturing.",188,,
476,0.97,5063.425,5065.193,There's also Washington chain and supply.,188,,
477,0.97,5065.193,5069.23,"They started in Soto, in 1888.",188,,
478,0.97,5069.23,5070.231,As scrap material.,188,,
479,0.97,5070.231,5072.734,"And now, they have shifted over the years.",188,,
480,0.97,5072.734,5074.669,And changed hands.,188,,
481,0.97,5074.669,5079.24,But their chain manufacturing for the waterfront and the Seaport.,188,,
482,0.97,5079.24,5080.241,And they're located.,188,,
483,0.97,5080.241,5096.224,"They love being located in the manufacturing industrial center because they're--they can supply the port of Seattle, as well as being near Ballard for all the fishing industries, to things like candles.",188,,
484,0.97,5096.224,5101.062,So the manufacturing industry is very economically diverse.,188,,
485,0.97,5101.062,5108.536,"And there's--in your Appendix, there's data that really has a lot of information.",188,,
486,0.97,5108.536,5110.638,But there are great living wage jobs.,188,,
487,0.97,5110.638,5119.08,"And as we talk about, we want to focus on getting black and Brown folks and women into these industries, so they can be successful.",188,,
488,0.97,5119.08,5127.922,"So in the data, it basically shows that there are more jobs in wider industries, and on average, they get paid more.",188,,
489,0.97,5127.922,5136.264,"And there's fewer jobs in more diverse industries but on average, they get paid less.",188,,
490,0.97,5136.264,5140.001,We want to try and change some of that.,188,,
491,0.97,5140.001,5141.636,"Overall, it is 65% white.",188,,
492,0.97,5141.636,5147.575,"Compared to the total of King County, which is 66% white.",188,,
493,0.97,5147.575,5149.444,So--go ahead.,188,,
494,0.97,5149.444,5150.912,Director Lee.,189,,
495,0.97,5150.912,5151.779,My favorite slide.,189,,
496,0.97,5151.779,5153.014,It's not in this deck.,189,,
497,0.97,5153.014,5156.518,But can you just summarize it?,189,,
498,0.97,5156.518,5169.33,It compares the percentage of the growth--or--gross product of the city.,189,,
499,0.97,5169.33,5171.9,For manufacturing.,189,,
500,0.97,5171.9,5173.334,Here to other cities?,189,,
501,0.97,5173.334,5173.801,Right.,190,,
502,0.97,5173.801,5175.503,And we're--I mean.,191,,
503,0.97,5175.503,5177.138,We are a manufacturing city.,191,,
504,0.97,5177.138,5182.143,"But it doesn't look like it by the numbers, right?",191,,
505,0.97,5182.143,5184.045,Yeah.,192,,
506,0.97,5184.045,5189.417,"No, what--so it's called a regional growth product.",192,,
507,0.97,5189.417,5193.021,"Like GDP, but regionally based.",192,,
508,0.97,5193.021,5202.53,"And one of the things that make those data meaningful, is when you look at multiple different points over time and look at the change.",192,,
509,0.97,5202.53,5207.635,So certain industry within Seatle has really boomed in the last 15 years.,192,,
510,0.97,5207.635,5211.839,"And became--it's really knowledge economy, high Tech.",192,,
511,0.97,5211.839,5221.149,It has really become a dominant Player in a way that is--still dominant.,192,,
512,0.97,5221.149,5222.85,It actually makes everybody else look small.,192,,
513,0.97,5222.85,5223.651,Uh-huh.,193,,
514,0.97,5223.651,5230.959,"So in the old days, in the manufacturing production economy, Boeing jobs were like the high numbers.",194,,
515,0.97,5230.959,5234.395,"But now, the manufacturing numbers.",194,,
516,0.97,5234.395,5237.699,They maintain relatively the same.,194,,
517,0.97,5237.699,5239.968,But other industries have skyrocketed.,194,,
518,0.97,5239.968,5240.702,Now they look small.,194,,
519,0.97,5240.702,5249.777,"So the behavior of the economy has really shifted over time, in a way that is a little too disproportionate.",194,,
520,0.97,5249.777,5250.044,Right.,195,,
521,0.97,5250.044,5254.916,"And what was compelling to me about that particular slide, though, is it compares Seattle to other cities.",195,,
522,0.97,5254.916,5257.552,And if you have a vision of what a healthy economy is.,195,,
523,0.97,5257.552,5258.219,That's right.,196,,
524,0.97,5258.219,5260.688,It's a cross sector.,197,,
525,0.97,5260.688,5262.323,It's not heavily based.,197,,
526,0.97,5262.323,5263.625,That's my point.,198,,
527,0.97,5263.625,5265.927,Is that we are too dominant in one area.,198,,
528,0.97,5265.927,5267.629,And we need to balance it out.,198,,
529,0.97,5267.629,5272.4,"And manufacturing, because of the low barrier to entry issue.",198,,
530,0.97,5272.4,5279.073,"Allows that inclusive economy agenda to be Actualized, if we can balance that out a little more.",198,,
531,0.97,5279.073,5281.643,"Right now, it's a little too SKEWED in one area.",198,,
532,0.97,5281.643,5283.978,And that's creating the inequity.,198,,
533,0.97,5283.978,5285.146,Thank you.,199,,
534,0.97,5285.146,5285.947,Yeah.,200,,
535,0.97,5285.947,5286.214,Go ahead.,200,,
536,0.97,5286.214,5296.257,"So with low barrier to entry, meaning that there's lots of apprenticeships that Seattle colleges already support.",201,,
537,0.97,5296.257,5302.063,There's programs that you can get a welding certificate in six months.,201,,
538,0.97,5302.063,5305.4,You don't have to have that bachelor's degree to be successful.,201,,
539,0.97,5305.4,5307.969,And if you look at the wages here.,201,,
540,0.97,5307.969,5311.973,"The range is 44,000 to 182,000.",201,,
541,0.97,5311.973,5326.054,"And the average, you know, is--I mean, in that one company, even for the ones that are Above-Average representation of color, it's $93,000 a year.",201,,
542,0.97,5326.054,5333.961,"So we talk about trying to Getfolks an awareness to get into jobs that create a career, rather than just a job.",201,,
543,0.97,5333.961,5335.329,This is one of them.,201,,
544,0.97,5335.329,5338.9,And we can't let that go.,201,,
545,0.97,5338.9,5340.168,What O.E.D.,201,,
546,0.97,5340.168,5354.816,"Is doing particularly in this arena is, they're supporting Ajack, which is the arrow space joint apprenticeship Committee, youth apprenticeship.",201,,
547,0.97,5354.816,5359.62,They've helped establish a youth science building.,201,,
548,0.97,5359.62,5362.323,They've helped do the industrial manufacturing facility.,201,,
549,0.97,5362.323,5363.524,"They've done--we, I guess.",201,,
550,0.97,5363.524,5365.793,Sorry.,201,,
551,0.97,5365.793,5370.465,Support tried trade programs which we just talked about in manufacturing and building trades.,201,,
552,0.97,5370.465,5379.44,"They fund port jobs, which helps get jobs in the trades, and the transportation logistics and aircraft manufacturing at the airport.",201,,
553,0.97,5379.44,5385.113,Our port and our airport is one of the fastest growing airports in the nation.,201,,
554,0.97,5385.113,5389.951,Supporting the harbor Island welding program that is Colocated at vigor shipyard.,201,,
555,0.97,5389.951,5398.159,And that is a great example of a good Public-Private partnership that we would want to emulate in the future.,201,,
556,0.97,5398.159,5402.497,Helping establish diesel mechanics program at South Seattle college.,201,,
557,0.97,5402.497,5406.567,And helping establish a vehicle maintenance program at shoreline community college.,201,,
558,0.97,5406.567,5413.04,So lots of good work in the manufacturing area.,201,,
559,0.97,5413.04,5417.345,"So the Maritime industry is my Bailiwick, obviously.",201,,
560,0.97,5417.345,5419.38,There are six main sectors.,201,,
561,0.97,5419.38,5424.485,So you've got boat building and ship repair and maintenance.,201,,
562,0.97,5424.485,5428.222,"So that's new construction of vessels, as well as maintenance and repair.",201,,
563,0.97,5428.222,5432.426,You've got the recreational boating and instruction.,201,,
564,0.97,5432.426,5437.999,"And recreational boating in general, which includes recreational marinas.",201,,
565,0.97,5437.999,5441.903,Retail boat dealers.,201,,
566,0.97,5441.903,5443.805,"Water-Born, like scenic, sightseeing tours.",201,,
567,0.97,5443.805,5446.474,Then you've got the commercial fishing industry.,201,,
568,0.97,5446.474,5448.109,And the seafood processing.,201,,
569,0.97,5448.109,5463.09,"There's--people don't realize, but 50% of the fish that is consumed in the United States, those ships are home Ported right here at fisherman's terminal.",201,,
570,0.97,5463.09,5465.693,So supporting--so supporting--Yeah.,201,,
571,0.97,5465.693,5466.961,I knew that.,202,,
572,0.97,5466.961,5467.762,I knew that.,202,,
573,0.97,5467.762,5471.232,Food service.,203,,
574,0.97,5471.232,5482.543,"Then there's the Maritime logistics, which is all the deep water and shallow water port movement.",203,,
575,0.97,5482.543,5486.113,Inland freight.,203,,
576,0.97,5486.113,5486.547,Warehouses storage.,203,,
577,0.97,5486.547,5487.615,This includes longshoremen.,203,,
578,0.97,5487.615,5492.82,"Passenger vessel, or passenger water transportation, which we all think of as just the Washington state ferries.",203,,
579,0.97,5492.82,5501.028,"But there's commuters with the Walk-On ferries, the high-speed ferries, visitors, cruises and Argasy and things like that.",203,,
580,0.97,5501.028,5514.775,"Then you also have the Maritime support services, which are everything from environmental firms, naval architectures, construction firms, law, accounting, marine education services, et cetera.",203,,
581,0.97,5514.775,5519.48,"So the Maritime industry is really, you have to think of it as an Ecosystem.",203,,
582,0.97,5519.48,5522.35,Because it all relies on one another.,203,,
583,0.97,5522.35,5531.792,"And if they have to, the ships and the vessels need the shipyards and the architects and the suppliers and the warehouses and the manufacturers, altogether, supporting them.",203,,
584,0.97,5531.792,5535.93,And we have this amazing history here.,203,,
585,0.97,5535.93,5542.27,And this natural deep water port that most cities don't have?,203,,
586,0.97,5542.27,5550.111,And we tend--I think the society as a whole in our community don't really realize that they're connected to the Maritime industry.,203,,
587,0.97,5550.111,5551.913,But if you eat fish.,203,,
588,0.97,5551.913,5554.015,If you've taken a ferry.,203,,
589,0.97,5554.015,5555.983,If you wear clothes.,203,,
590,0.97,5555.983,5561.322,"If you have electronics, you're connected to the Maritime industry.",203,,
591,0.97,5561.322,5564.825,So everybody is connected.,203,,
592,0.97,5564.825,5568.329,So why it's important for us to--why do we care?,203,,
593,0.97,5568.329,5575.136,"Now, these are statistics for Washington.",203,,
594,0.97,5575.136,5583.21,But the--the Maritime industry in Washington is a 37.8 billion dollar industry.,203,,
595,0.97,5583.21,5585.646,It provides 69.5 direct jobs.,203,,
596,0.97,5585.646,5589.116,The average wage of the Maritime worker is 55 years old.,203,,
597,0.97,5589.116,5596.557,"So in the next 10 years, we're going to have a mass retirement, which will equal upward mobility.",203,,
598,0.97,5596.557,5607.435,"In fact, the Washington state ferries, today, the folks that work on that, those boats, 50% of their work force is eligible for retirement today.",203,,
599,0.97,5607.435,5615.876,"So we are reaching kind of a crisis mode here in Seattle, as a state.",203,,
600,0.97,5615.876,5617.378,"As, honestly, as a nation.",203,,
601,0.97,5617.378,5625.252,"There's--if we were to deploy for a war, hopefully that wouldn't happen.",203,,
602,0.97,5625.252,5631.492,"But we are 8,000 Mariners short to support a national deployment.",203,,
603,0.97,5631.492,5636.664,So it's not just a Seattle problem or a Washington problem.,203,,
604,0.97,5636.664,5641.502,There's stuff going on everywhere.,203,,
605,0.97,5641.502,5646.54,Supporting these living wage jobs.,203,,
606,0.97,5646.54,5647.008,"$67,000 a year.",203,,
607,0.97,5647.008,5655.716,And we are the most trade Department state in the U.S. we are the Gateway with this beautiful geographic port.,203,,
608,0.97,5655.716,5660.721,"So we at O.E.D., we have been supporting the youth mare time collaborative.",203,,
609,0.97,5660.721,5667.528,"Which this year is in coordination with launch 206, which is an Internship program from the Seattle school district.",203,,
610,0.97,5667.528,5677.371,So we're hoping to get more Internships from Public-Private partnerships with the Maritime industry.,203,,
611,0.97,5677.371,5682.543,"They funded Seattle goodwill's youth Maritime program, which started two years ago.",203,,
612,0.97,5682.543,5685.413,They took their youth Year- round program.,203,,
613,0.97,5685.413,5690.685,And made it into a Maritime program for awareness and preparedness.,203,,
614,0.97,5690.685,5695.856,And they brought me on board.,203,,
615,0.97,5695.856,5709.07,"So with 36 years in my connections, trying to get these employers, part of my job is to support them in getting the employers we were just talking about industry coming to the table with finances and helping.",203,,
616,0.97,5709.07,5721.682,"That's part of my job is to talk to these folks and get them to the table, so that we can start talking about what they need, including--Li'll go into that in a second.",203,,
617,0.97,5721.682,5724.719,But the pathways to success don't need a bachelor's degree.,203,,
618,0.97,5724.719,5740.301,"And these are two main industries in Seattle that have a long-term history that we can help get people, young people and adults into these jobs in a short amount of time.",203,,
619,0.97,5740.301,5750.911,So one of the things we have been doing in this strategy is the Mayor pulled together the Maritime and industry strategy Stakeholders process.,203,,
620,0.97,5750.911,5754.315,This is the actual location that we're talking about.,203,,
621,0.97,5754.315,5758.419,So these are the manufacturing industrial centers.,203,,
622,0.97,5758.419,5767.027,"You'll notice that on the Left- hand side, there are many regional centers of manufacturing, or Maritime.",203,,
623,0.97,5767.027,5774.468,But we're just talking about these two specific places that are what's called the Bin-Mick.,203,,
624,0.97,5774.468,5776.003,Which is Ballard inner Bay.,203,,
625,0.97,5776.003,5784.111,"And then the Duamish Mick, which includes Soto, Georgetown, and South park.",203,,
626,0.97,5784.111,5788.282,So the Stakeholder group includes one city wide group.,203,,
627,0.97,5788.282,5790.451,And then four neighborhood groups.,203,,
628,0.97,5790.451,5797.958,"The four neighborhood groups are Georgetown, South Park, Ballard, inner Bay, and Soto.",203,,
629,0.97,5797.958,5801.562,The city wide group will have seven different meetings.,203,,
630,0.97,5801.562,5809.069,The four neighborhood groups will have four meetings each.,203,,
631,0.97,5809.069,5813.374,"And so far, we've had two sets of the neighborhood meetings in each neighborhood.",203,,
632,0.97,5813.374,5817.845,And we've had three sets of meetings in the city wide group.,203,,
633,0.97,5817.845,5823.584,"And most of the issues that have come up, the dominant issues have been work force issues.",203,,
634,0.97,5823.584,5827.521,"We need more people, more people need to know about these.",203,,
635,0.97,5827.521,5829.523,They need skilled work force.,203,,
636,0.97,5829.523,5834.195,They need to diversify.,203,,
637,0.97,5834.195,5834.728,Transportation issues.,203,,
638,0.97,5834.728,5840.601,"How do we get these workers that we need to the jobs in an effective, efficient manner?",203,,
639,0.97,5840.601,5847.608,"And from an environmental standpoint, how do we get less single use cars on the road?",203,,
640,0.97,5847.608,5852.012,And we can get folks there to reduce emissions?,203,,
641,0.97,5852.012,5854.982,Affordable work space and housing.,203,,
642,0.97,5854.982,5862.256,"If people are going to be working, we have a lot of folks that work in this part of the industry.",203,,
643,0.97,5862.256,5864.725,Or in middle wage jobs that can't live in Seattle anymore.,203,,
644,0.97,5864.725,5869.73,So we want to make sure that they can live and work in potentially the same place.,203,,
645,0.97,5869.73,5873.834,There's public safety issues that are coming up.,203,,
646,0.97,5873.834,5886.046,"Of course, with the homeless camper situations in the industrial areas, as well as pedestrian safety and infrastructure changes.",203,,
647,0.97,5886.046,5890.451,"And environmental issues, particularly in South Park, have come up.",203,,
648,0.97,5890.451,5896.857,And then land use is obviously the main issue that is going to be talked about.,203,,
649,0.97,5896.857,5900.661,And the horse trading that is going to have to happen.,203,,
650,0.97,5900.661,5902.529,But that's not the whole process.,203,,
651,0.97,5902.529,5910.037,The point was to try and make strategies that we can have middle wage jobs and land use is just a tool.,203,,
652,0.97,5910.037,5912.773,To help us do that.,203,,
653,0.97,5912.773,5916.477,"So the Deliverables, it went from November through August.",203,,
654,0.97,5916.477,5919.68,It will go into the summer.,203,,
655,0.97,5919.68,5928.255,"There was a vision for the industrial Maritime lands, which is of--envisioning 10 to 15 years out in the future.",203,,
656,0.97,5928.255,5936.397,One of the other Deliverables is a neighborhood division of how that neighborhood would want to see their Maritime and manufacturing area.,203,,
657,0.97,5936.397,5945.973,"The principles, the Mayor came up with five different principals that all of this work has been the lens that people have been looking through.",203,,
658,0.97,5945.973,5957.985,"Policies, they're going to be making recommendations on what policies and programs we could be doing to help support whatever this vision is.",203,,
659,0.97,5957.985,5962.723,And then there's city wide actions and local actions that would happen in each of those neighborhoods.,203,,
660,0.97,5962.723,5963.424,That's where we're at.,203,,
661,0.97,5963.424,5969.163,"We're happy to come back and give you an update, once this is all finished up.",203,,
662,0.97,5969.163,5973.033,But there's a lot more to do.,203,,
663,0.97,5973.033,5973.3,Great.,204,,
664,0.97,5973.3,5975.836,So I have a few questions for you.,204,,
665,0.97,5975.836,5976.37,Couple related to this.,204,,
666,0.97,5976.37,5977.905,But before I get there.,204,,
667,0.97,5977.905,5984.144,We've talked a little bit about the work force development Council.,204,,
668,0.97,5984.144,5985.846,And the previous slide.,204,,
669,0.97,5985.846,5986.48,Also showed Tacoma.,204,,
670,0.97,5986.48,5989.883,"So can you talk a little bit about the relationship, too, with the port?",204,,
671,0.97,5989.883,5993.954,And especially this Port- partnership as it relates to Work-Force development?,204,,
672,0.97,5993.954,5995.956,Sure.,205,,
673,0.97,5995.956,6002.229,So the port itself has an alliance with Tacoma.,205,,
674,0.97,6002.229,6004.531,So it's called the sea port alliance.,205,,
675,0.97,6004.531,6004.798,Right.,206,,
676,0.97,6004.798,6005.733,They have that going on.,207,,
677,0.97,6005.733,6013.173,"I don't know exactly what, from the port's perspective, what they're doing with Seattle and Tacoma for work force.",207,,
678,0.97,6013.173,6018.979,The port of Seattle definitely has a work force development program and partnership.,207,,
679,0.97,6018.979,6023.917,I'm hoping with me being on board that I already have a relationship with the port.,207,,
680,0.97,6023.917,6028.489,Not that we didn't observe.,207,,
681,0.97,6028.489,6030.391,But I think that relationship will get stronger.,207,,
682,0.97,6030.391,6034.194,So that we can do some of that.,207,,
683,0.97,6034.194,6038.665,"Councilmember, is there a particular issue you wanted us to follow up on?",208,,
684,0.97,6038.665,6045.472,"As a new elected official, talking with the new port Commissioner.",209,,
685,0.97,6045.472,6049.777,And Sam Cho is also interested in economic development.,209,,
686,0.97,6049.777,6053.28,We've had some Offline conversation.,209,,
687,0.97,6053.28,6053.814,We'll dig in more.,210,,
688,0.97,6053.814,6060.02,And to go to Council person her bolt's comment about the high school.,211,,
689,0.97,6060.02,6066.86,I've been talking to Ryan Caulkins for a couple of years about that in my former role.,211,,
690,0.97,6066.86,6069.396,And they are moving forward.,211,,
691,0.97,6069.396,6078.338,There is a potential looking at that being located in South park.,211,,
692,0.97,6078.338,6080.941,In collaboration with Spu.,211,,
693,0.97,6080.941,6091.151,And we're working Sasha and I have been working with Spu to figure out how we can work that from a community perspective.,211,,
694,0.97,6091.151,6091.418,Okay.,212,,
695,0.97,6091.418,6097.224,And then if you go to the industrial lands strategy.,213,,
696,0.97,6097.224,6098.592,The calendar.,214,,
697,0.97,6098.592,6099.927,"The calendar, Yeah.",215,,
698,0.97,6099.927,6103.664,So I'm still trying to understand a little bit about how this is unfolding.,215,,
699,0.97,6103.664,6119.213,But one thing that I noticed on this is the for May policy recommendations and EIS Oovments.,215,,
700,0.97,6119.213,6122.683,Can you--so my understanding about the E.I.S.,215,,
701,0.97,6122.683,6125.619,Process is that it is related to a particular project.,215,,
702,0.97,6125.619,6128.055,But I don't see any particular project identified there.,215,,
703,0.97,6128.055,6132.159,So is that just kind of a Placeholder?,215,,
704,0.97,6132.159,6132.326,Or?,215,,
705,0.97,6132.326,6137.931,It is--they're kind of doing the economic or the E.I.S.,216,,
706,0.97,6137.931,6141.435,They're beginning to pull together the things to do the E.I.S.,216,,
707,0.97,6141.435,6142.369,Kind of on the side.,216,,
708,0.97,6142.369,6151.712,"But they're waiting for us to get to that policy level and what some of the recommendations will be so that we can know if we did nothing, here's what it would look like.",216,,
709,0.97,6151.712,6156.95,"If we did these things that you ask us to potentially do, what would it look like?",216,,
710,0.97,6156.95,6160.687,So they're in the process of kind of gathering all of that data.,216,,
711,0.97,6160.687,6163.524,"And this next step, in at least the initiate part.",216,,
712,0.97,6163.524,6169.53,W are to the places where they're going to start proposing policies and program changes.,216,,
713,0.97,6169.53,6173.7,"And then in the city part, they're a little bit further behind that piece.",216,,
714,0.97,6173.7,6176.937,So we're not quite on this time line.,216,,
715,0.97,6176.937,6181.708,But this is the most recent one.,216,,
716,0.97,6181.708,6183.81,Doesn't answer your question fully.,216,,
717,0.97,6183.81,6186.079,And I'm happy to give more information.,216,,
718,0.97,6186.079,6186.38,I know.,217,,
719,0.97,6186.38,6189.55,I was just talk more about policy.,217,,
720,0.97,6189.55,6190.017,And the E.I.S.,217,,
721,0.97,6190.017,6192.886,Was part of a particular development project.,217,,
722,0.97,6192.886,6194.221,And if nothing has been identified yet.,217,,
723,0.97,6194.221,6196.256,I'm not sure what we're assessing.,217,,
724,0.97,6196.256,6198.458,We could follow with an E- mail.,218,,
725,0.97,6198.458,6198.859,Okay.,219,,
726,0.97,6198.859,6199.526,That was great.,219,,
727,0.97,6199.526,6201.728,Thank you.,219,,
728,0.97,6201.728,6202.729,Is that it?,219,,
729,0.97,6202.729,6204.031,Yes.,220,,
730,0.97,6204.031,6205.399,We are done.,220,,
731,0.97,6205.399,6206.433,That's it.,221,,
732,0.97,6206.433,6207.134,That's all you're doing.,221,,
733,0.97,6207.134,6210.537,You have any questions?,222,,
734,0.97,6210.537,6211.838,Okay.,223,,
735,0.97,6211.838,6217.277,Do our Council members have any other questions?,223,,
736,0.97,6217.277,6217.477,Okay.,223,,
737,0.97,6217.477,6224.184,"So I do have lots of things I'm excited to follow up with you on, different programs, opportunities.",223,,
738,0.97,6224.184,6224.351,Oh.,223,,
739,0.97,6224.351,6226.453,So I did have one more question.,223,,
740,0.97,6226.453,6227.921,Which you started to talk about.,223,,
741,0.97,6227.921,6230.424,And then I think I interrupted you.,223,,
742,0.97,6230.424,6233.56,But what do you need?,223,,
743,0.97,6233.56,6242.703,"You were talking about, you know, at the--you had started talking about opportunities for upward mobility and launch 206.",223,,
744,0.97,6242.703,6243.203,Uh-huh.,224,,
