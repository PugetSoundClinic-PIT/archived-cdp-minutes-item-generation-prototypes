27,0.97,162.428,172.839,"For the items on today's agenda and before we begin, I ask that everyone please be patient as we learn to optimize the system in real time.",13,,
28,0.97,172.839,193.193,Remains are strong intent to a public comment regularly included but the city council reserves the right to end or limit these common periods at any point if we deem the system is abused or is unsuitable for allowing the meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we are able to conduct necessary business.,13,,
29,0.97,193.193,196.462,I will moderate the comment period in the following manner.,13,,

50,0.97,323.89,335.835,"Few have been as successful as the Ballard Avenue open street, due to coordination between the city, Ballard alliance and businesses on the street.",16,,
51,0.97,335.835,343.409,Cb 120068 opens the Pathway to make the success permanent and I encourage the city Council to move ahead with this legislation.,16,,
52,0.97,343.409,383.649,"One quick note, the staff fiscal NOTE stand there is only one fiscal impact for the proposed legislation and that is for Sdot Forgoing permit fees associated with giving of parking spaces in front of businesses . I hope that as the legislation moves forward, with Sdot and the city, they will look at how much money the city will make from sales tax and salaries and other things from people being able to eat and enjoy restaurants on Ballard Avenue in the new Pergolas and things outside.",16,,
53,0.97,383.649,394.827,"With that note, I look forward to making Ballard avenues Pergola-Safe streets permanent and hopefully, finding other places around the city to do the same.",16,,

58,0.97,417.817,422.088,Covid hit our business hard and we are grateful for the temporary Street permitting.,18,,
59,0.97,422.088,425.958,We would have had to close without this but the effect goes beyond the survival.,18,,
60,0.97,425.958,434.467,It was incredible activation for the city with it being so powerful.,18,,
61,0.97,434.467,437.336,"When you live outside the community with your neighbors, things change.",18,,
62,0.97,437.336,448.147,I speak in favor of the extension beyond October to make this a permanent feature.,18,,
63,0.97,448.147,452.185,This is not just about the parking space tables you see.,18,,
64,0.97,452.185,453.219,There are two elements you might not know about.,18,,
65,0.97,453.219,461.694,"First, more liberal role food truck permitting.",18,,
66,0.97,461.694,462.495,We do not serve food ourselves.,18,,
67,0.97,462.495,484.35,"By moving the food truck off our own property to extend our seating onto temporary On- Street parking, this was crucial for the truck's survival during Covid and expanded their customers and was a great benefit to activation for the entire neighborhood.",18,,
68,0.97,484.35,490.99,"Temporary Street closures, like many businesses, ours does not have adjacent parking to use for seating.",18,,
69,0.97,490.99,498.564,We do have a small side street that we could close down in the evenings and weekends when we would need it.,18,,
70,0.97,498.564,509.408,"Treating all of these options to coordination of Sdot, police and fire and as well, with our neighbors, at a time when nobody had money for these things.",18,,
71,0.97,509.408,524.457,"There were camping tents just to make it work but the design will get better and the rules for permitting will evolve and we should give them ample time to do the work right, rather than lose this incredible community feeling.",18,,
72,0.97,524.457,532.665,"Seattle, we can favor people and businesses that employ them and nourish them over the cars we normally have in the streets.",18,,
73,0.97,532.665,533.165,Thank you for the time.,18,,
74,0.97,533.165,533.499,Thank you.,19,,

77,0.97,539.906,540.506,"Last, we have Jesse Clawson.",19,,
78,0.97,540.506,540.873,Good morning.,19,,
79,0.97,540.873,551.284,"Hello, Council members.",20,,
80,0.97,551.284,552.285,Can you hear me?,20,,
81,0.97,552.285,552.585,We can.,21,,
82,0.97,552.585,553.252,Great to hear your voice.,21,,
83,0.97,553.252,559.325,Hello.,22,,
84,0.97,559.325,566.132,"Jesse Clawson, seven Oh one- Fifth Avenue and I represent the owners of the Mobile home parks impacted by the legislation you are discussing today.",22,,
85,0.97,566.132,577.977,I sent a comment letter on Friday outlining our concerns with the checklist and determination prepared by staff.,22,,
86,0.97,577.977,597.797,"The Cepa checklist is riddled with errors and doesn't fully analyze the impact of the legislation, that could lead to put these mobile home parks out of business, exactly what the Council is trying to avoid.",22,,
87,0.97,597.797,609.742,This legislation has the Council needing to get it right and there's an opportunity to assist the people who live at the Mobile home parks rather than throwing them out of the systems.,22,,
88,0.97,609.742,612.545,We are concerned that is what this legislation will do.,22,,
89,0.97,612.545,622.455,I note that it appears as if I'm the only person Commenting publicly today and that leads to participation concerns.,22,,
90,0.97,622.455,628.527,"During Covid-19, I wonder about the outreach to the individuals who live in the Mobile home parks.",22,,
91,0.97,628.527,629.929,"And, to ask them what they think this could do for the parks.",22,,
92,0.97,629.929,651.55,"In terms of Sepa, we request it be limited to 30 days so it gives time for staff to analyze the Sepa impact and for Council to have that information in front of them before they consider this legislation.",22,,
93,0.97,651.55,653.653,Thanks very much.,22,,
94,0.97,653.653,663.829,"Thank you, Jesse.",23,,
95,0.97,663.829,669.368,"I.T., can you confirm there are no further speakers?",23,,
96,0.97,669.368,670.269,No other public comment registrants.,24,,
97,0.97,670.269,674.573,Thank you.,25,,
98,0.97,674.573,682.982,"As we have no additional speakers, we will move to the next agenda item.",25,,
99,0.97,682.982,696.996,"Our first item of business is a breaking discussion and vote on Council bill 120068, extending the street Cafc and Cafc Street permits.",25,,
100,0.97,696.996,700.132,Please read the abbreviated title into the record.,25,,
101,0.97,700.132,713.379,"Constable 120068, an ordinance relating to Street and sidewalk use, amending ordinance 125706 and the street use permit fee schedule and the Seattle municipal code.",26,,
102,0.97,713.379,713.712,Thank you.,27,,
103,0.97,713.712,719.885,We are joined by Alyse Nelson.,27,,
104,0.97,719.885,732.898,They have moved mountains to prove the street Cafc and sidewalk Cafc and curb space permits.,27,,
105,0.97,732.898,738.037,"The team has stretched as far as they can go and that's why I oftentimes referred to their work, Wizardry work.",27,,
106,0.97,738.037,747.746,They can create new--the ability to use our Strets in so many new ways.,27,,
107,0.97,747.746,757.423,We heard from the public Commenters that many businesses have been saved during this pandemic because we allowed them to operate in the streets.,27,,
108,0.97,757.423,769.135,I want to thank Alyse Nelson and Calvin chow and the team up front to make today possible.,27,,
109,0.97,769.135,775.975,We will hear from Alyse Nelson and Calvin chow and I have an amendment to add to the legislation.,27,,
110,0.97,775.975,788.454,It's important we move as quickly as possible to give businesses the certainty that they need to be successful for the next year and that's why I have an amendment that was not in the original draft.,27,,
111,0.97,788.454,790.122,"Alyse Nelson and Calvin chow, welcome and introduce yourselves and take us away.",27,,
112,0.97,790.122,804.336,"I'm Calvin chow with central staff and will do the presentation of the legislation amendment, Council members Strauss and Alyse Nelson is here to help with questions with the program.",28,,
113,0.97,804.336,805.137,Do you want to introduce yourself?,28,,
114,0.97,805.137,805.704,Thank you for having me.,29,,
115,0.97,805.704,816.882,I'm Alyse Nelson and I'm the acting public space manager for street uses and public space management group and I'm happy to be here to help answer any questions you may have.,29,,
116,0.97,816.882,821.62,Great.,30,,
117,0.97,821.62,825.124,I'm trying to share.,30,,
118,0.97,825.124,856.655,"Council members, Council members Strauss, at your direction, I drafted some legislation to extend the Cafc streets permit . If you will remember, last year, Sdot started new programs to allow temporary businesses to use sidewalks and curbs case vending, displays and Cafc uses in that program was authorized for October 31, 2021.",30,,
119,0.97,856.655,857.656,"Basically, through the street use fee schedule.",30,,
120,0.97,857.656,874.974,"The existing program is administered under the Sdot administration Right-Of-Way and the Council has the focus on establishing the fee schedule and that can change in the future, depending on where the program goes.",30,,
121,0.97,874.974,882.781,"The legislation in front of each day at a men's that it to allow the permit through May 31, 2022.",30,,
122,0.97,882.781,894.96,It's a very simple piece of legislation and literally champions the temporary business uses and extends that until May 31 of next year.,30,,
123,0.97,894.96,906.605,"You also asked to have a proposed amendment, number one and that does two things.",30,,
124,0.97,906.605,909.975,It adds a section that allows us to weigh permit fees for existing long-term permit holders.,30,,
125,0.97,909.975,935.134,Those folks who use it in a similar way under the long-term permits would have the same fee waiver through May 31 as temporary users and you added a new section or proposed a new section to direct Sdot to develop a long-term program with a draft proposal due on December 15 and the legislative proposal due on May 31.,30,,
126,0.97,935.134,945.311,"And, Alyse Nelson, any comments or things you might want to say at this point?",30,,
127,0.97,945.311,952.718,I will just say that we support the amendment here.,31,,
128,0.97,952.718,958.957,"We are working to think about what the permanent program should look like and this seems totally within reach for us, as far as the time frame.",31,,
129,0.97,958.957,967.399,"Councilmember, I don't know that this is a very complicated piece of legislation.",32,,
130,0.97,967.399,974.34,"If there are questions or things would like us to get into further, we are happy to answer questions.",32,,
131,0.97,974.34,976.975,"Thank you, Calvin and colleagues.",33,,
132,0.97,976.975,993.792,"You know from my past practice that I like to have bills before the committee for two meetings before passing them, so as not to rush anything and to ensure everyone has time to comment and ask questions and have a Deliberative process.",33,,
133,0.97,993.792,1013.178,"Because this bill has been before us before and because this bill is simply changing the date for the extension of the free permits and because this bill is setting forward a work plan for the Pathway to Permanency, I would love to be able to move this out of the committee today.",33,,
134,0.97,1013.178,1042.841,"I want to frame our conversation today that we started off with a pilot program, a Pathway to Permanency and between having the pilot regulations, we need this interim moment to give Sdot time to complete the final outreach to ensure that the fee schedule is correct and we are creating spaces that are accessible for all ages and abilities and that the legislation will give businesses an additional year of free permits for them to recover from the pandemic.",33,,
135,0.97,1042.841,1052.184,"I do want to call out Alyse Nelson's team, again.",33,,
136,0.97,1052.184,1060.159,They could have been doing this research in the last year to create a Pathway to Permanency right now.,33,,
137,0.97,1060.159,1065.13,"However, they were using their time to ensure that they got as many permits out the door as possible.",33,,
138,0.97,1065.13,1074.706,"Again, I congratulate and thank the team for spending their time in that way.",33,,
139,0.97,1074.706,1080.446,"Otherwise, we would not have as many curb space Cafc permits out there right now.",33,,
140,0.97,1080.446,1082.981,Really good job.,33,,
141,0.97,1082.981,1085.617,I see a couple of questions.,33,,
142,0.97,1085.617,1087.92,Councilmember Pedersen and then Councilmember Lewis.,33,,
143,0.97,1087.92,1088.42,Councilmember Pedersen?,33,,
144,0.97,1088.42,1090.088,Thank you chairs Strauss and thank you for bringing this legislation forward.,34,,
145,0.97,1090.088,1120.853,I support extending this as we are still in the pandemic and businesses are struggling and some of them have made those capital investments to set things up . I do want to learn more . I will have questions when we get closer to anything being permanent . I want to better understand.,34,,
146,0.97,1120.853,1126.925,Sdot is being asked to come back in December with a plan and then legislation in March.,34,,
147,0.97,1126.925,1146.044,"What is being made permanent, the fact that businesses--this program will be available for free to get permits to occupy this space, or that the existing permits would be made permanent?",34,,
148,0.97,1146.044,1146.879,"Great questions, Councilmember.",35,,
149,0.97,1146.879,1157.089,This is a Pathway to Permanency and Alyse Nelson has been great in educating me.,35,,
150,0.97,1157.089,1163.061,These permits already exist within the Sdot's Purview?,35,,
151,0.97,1163.061,1169.101,"So, businesses could, in the past, have applied for these permits.",35,,
152,0.97,1169.101,1173.438,What has been prohibitive as a cost associated with the permits.,35,,
153,0.97,1173.438,1194.359,"In some ways and sometimes, they are associated with the amount of money that the parking space would generate revenue and we heard from public Commenters that it might not be the right fee to associate with the permit because it is cost prohibitive for the business and we are not taking into consideration the other aspects of the sales tax revenue generation.",35,,
154,0.97,1194.359,1215.614,That is something we need to look at and I brought up that we need to make sure these spaces are accessible for all ages and abilities and there are some small Tweaks that need to be made to the program and what needs to be legislated is removing the requirement of Sdot to charge a fee.,35,,
155,0.97,1215.614,1227.426,I want to provide businesses that additional year to recover without having to pay for these while we finalize these regulations of the currently existing program.,35,,
156,0.97,1227.426,1230.095,"Alyse Nelson, did I get that right?",35,,
157,0.97,1230.095,1250.716,Who did a really good job summarizing but I would add that we partly see this as an extension to give us more time to work through some of what we've done so far and what is working well and what may be could be changed.,36,,
158,0.97,1250.716,1255.12,"And, to listen to businesses and residents to hear what their perspectives are.",36,,
159,0.97,1255.12,1261.059,We haven't had as much time to do that outreach and engagement.,36,,
160,0.97,1261.059,1276.375,"In addition to hearing from permit holders and understanding their experience, we want to reach out and listen to business districts and residents to understand and appreciate about the programs.",36,,
161,0.97,1276.375,1280.145,"We can refine the strategy moving forward with a permanent proposal, like Councilmember Strauss said.",36,,
162,0.97,1280.145,1290.555,We have existing tools in the Toolbox and that part is there for us but there might be refinements in addition to thinking about the fees and what is appropriate moving forward.,36,,
163,0.97,1290.555,1309.408,"To add on to that, I like to be up front and public about how we will do outreach so it gives everyone the most opportunity to participate and that's why we wanted to include it in the legislation today.",37,,
164,0.97,1309.408,1311.51,"Thank you, chair.",38,,
165,0.97,1311.51,1331.163,"This will make permanent that it would be a free cost and there would be no cost to the business, but it's not necessarily giving somebody a permit in Perpetuity to occupy that city space?",38,,
166,0.97,1331.163,1332.597,Correct.,39,,
167,0.97,1332.597,1336.268,"The permits always have a lifetime, and they then have to be renewed.",39,,
168,0.97,1336.268,1347.646,"Even in the last year, the existing permits expired and Alyse's team had to review all the permits.",39,,
169,0.97,1347.646,1349.648,"On Ballard Avenue, 35 of 36 businesses surveyed were supportive.",39,,
170,0.97,1349.648,1368.4,No matter when a permit--you know--Sdot can have a permanent Pathway but permits always have expirations and have to be renewed.,39,,
171,0.97,1368.4,1373.805,This legislation does not make these permits free in Perpetuity.,39,,
172,0.97,1373.805,1381.78,The free aspect is only for one year and this legislation outlines what the additional outreach needs to occur before we make any permanent changes.,39,,
173,0.97,1381.78,1386.852,"If I may add, our permits are temporary and Revocable.",40,,
174,0.97,1386.852,1392.924,We can't guarantee a long-term use of the Right-Of-Way through a permit.,40,,
175,0.97,1392.924,1401.6,"But, we are not in the game of going out and revoking, unnecessarily.",40,,
176,0.97,1401.6,1402.834,There is no guarantees for long- term use of the Right-Of-Way.,40,,
177,0.97,1402.834,1413.078,Thank you.,41,,
178,0.97,1413.378,1414.546,"Councilmember Pedersen, any other thoughts or questions?",42,,
179,0.97,1414.546,1414.78,No.,43,,
180,0.97,1414.78,1427.993,"I will look forward to it in December and I can ask questions, or leading up to December, so that things are incorporated in whatever they provide in December.",43,,
181,0.97,1427.993,1428.794,Thank you.,43,,
182,0.97,1428.794,1429.327,Councilmember Lewis?,44,,
183,0.97,1429.327,1448.213,"Thank you, Mr. chairman . I certainly am very supportive of this legislation and I appreciate the phasing of this approach . I actually wanted to ask something related to the end of the discussion with Councilmember Pedersen, just now.",45,,
184,0.97,1448.213,1455.153,"Which is, I know a lot of business owners certainly have plans.",45,,
185,0.97,1455.153,1483.682,"Just from my conversations with a lot of folks who have decided to take on these Street Eateries, they have more ambitious plans for the nature of the street Eatery, putting in Semipermanent platforms instead of just having them on the asphalt on the pavement and putting in other kind of features.",45,,
186,0.97,1483.682,1491.756,"For example, putting it on a platform with the ramp that could make it more Ada Compliant.",45,,
187,0.97,1491.756,1498.864,"Also, an impact in putting down a more permanent Footprint on the Right-Of-Way.",45,,
188,0.97,1498.864,1514.279,"To put my cards on the table, I'm all for that and I see it as basically being used as a Streetery or for vehicle parking.",45,,
189,0.97,1514.279,1526.091,"With those competing interests, I would prefer that we have these Streeteries and it seems to be the overwhelming consensus of most of the businesses, but not all and that is anecdotal because I haven't done a scientific survey.",45,,
190,0.97,1526.091,1538.103,The folks that I've talked to have noticed a real Uptick in business.,45,,
191,0.97,1538.103,1558.557,"Similarly, Councilmember Strauss, I've spent a decent amount of time on Ballard Avenue where the Streatery program is credited with giving a shot in the arm to those businesses during the most bleak times of the pandemic and increasing foot traffic and creating almost a Festival-Like atmosphere because you have people outside mixing around.",45,,
192,0.97,1558.557,1582.914,"In the future, I would like to keep that lightning and a bottle and our local economy and I would like to expand it and I like businesses to be able to make that investment to have a quasi permanent and more sophisticated Streatery that does have some of those additional infrastructure improvements, instead of, basically, a plywood frame over the street.",45,,
193,0.97,1582.914,1617.282,"That would seem to implicate giving more time and more guidance and a right of renewal if there is compliance with the permitting because I could see an issue if we expect people to annually Reapply the competitive process and if it is sort of an arbitrary decision, people making big investments in the sophisticated Streateries and then the city saying we want more parking here.",45,,
194,0.97,1617.282,1632.097,"I would like a little bit of deference that if a business owner makes this investment and if they are current on everything and have been complying with the terms of their permit, they can roll it over unless there is urgent need where the city has to come in.",45,,
195,0.97,1632.097,1638.336,They may have to replace a gas main or something and it would require removal of the Streatery.,45,,
196,0.97,1638.336,1678.977,"Barring something like that, I would like people to be able to rely on the investment they have made as a business to keep it there and in place . I wanted to throw it out there because I guess that is feedback and guidance as we develop as a central staff and a Department, what that final legislation is going to look like down the road, making sure that we have that consistency in making sure we have that priority so people can invest in these more souped-up and sophisticated Streateries that are really great additions to our environment.",45,,
197,0.97,1678.977,1689.554,"There is a particularly great one and Councilmember Pedersen's district, at big time on the Ann Avenue, much more sophisticated.",45,,
198,0.97,1689.554,1715.98,"I don't know if there is necessarily a question or if it is more guidance for the conversation, but I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this and I appreciate that this is something coming out of the pandemic that we will lean into and make it a bigger part of what we do, in reclaiming Street space for social and business uses, instead of just a single vehicle parking.",45,,
199,0.97,1715.98,1744.109,"Really well said, Councilmember Lewis . I know that Alyse has educated me many times over about the need to possibly address utility problems underneath the street and that is something we have to tape operation that will hop term permits by Sdot and even for structurally sound pedestrian bridges, since the one on Westlake in your district, they are also on term permits.",46,,
200,0.97,1744.109,1745.81,They have the same legal language that's included in these.,46,,
201,0.97,1745.81,1759.924,They are temporary and rebuke a bull despite--and for legal reasons--despite the pedestrian bridges being very permanent.,46,,
202,0.97,1759.924,1760.525,"Alyse, any thoughts to share?",46,,
203,0.97,1760.525,1760.759,Yes.,47,,
204,0.97,1760.759,1767.065,Thanks for the opportunity.,47,,
205,0.97,1767.065,1777.375,I would note that we have had a permanent Streatery and Parklet program for several years and I think it started in 2015.,47,,
206,0.97,1777.375,1785.083,"So, we are seeing people and businesses making investments in more permanent type Streatery structures.",47,,
207,0.97,1785.083,1798.596,"When we are reviewing something like that, part of our permanent review process is really to make sure we are permitting something that we think there is certainty that it can stay for that business investment reason.",47,,
208,0.97,1798.596,1803.434,We don't want to have to work with somebody to remove something in a shorter duration.,47,,
209,0.97,1803.434,1812.21,"So, we are working with folks that are looking at the plans and if it will stay for parking or planned for something different in the future.",47,,
210,0.97,1812.21,1815.814,We are looking at future construction and utility impacts.,47,,
211,0.97,1815.814,1832.33,"We want to make sure that when people invest in a curb Scape, despite the fact we can't guarantee it, we will eliminate that future state from occurring.",47,,
212,0.97,1832.33,1845.043,"Public space management and long term permits, they do have an annual renewing cycle but we don't Rereview or make a yearly decision.",47,,
213,0.97,1845.043,1857.455,"We do the work to inspect and invoice, if appropriate but we don't necessarily make a change to their approval at that time.",47,,
214,0.97,1857.455,1882.647,"If I could just add, since we have seen the growth of the use of these types of uses on our streets, it really is time for broader conversations for the folks were taking advantage of that and impacted by it to understand what it means for this program.",48,,
215,0.97,1882.647,1890.722,That could be administrative changes done on the Sdot side that could require legislative changes or would likely require a great change.,48,,
216,0.97,1890.722,1897.161,"It's probably not a fee permit, but how does the cost center shift the cost to make that work long term?",48,,
217,0.97,1897.161,1910.008,This is to buy us some time to understand what that is and then there will be time for Council to take this up next year.,48,,
218,0.97,1910.008,1912.61,"Thank you, Calvin and thank you, Alyse.",49,,
219,0.97,1912.61,1919.651,I understand that Vice-Chair Mosqueda ask questions and I will wait to see if others answer the questions I have.,49,,
220,0.97,1919.651,1922.32,"Thank you very much, Mr.",50,,
221,0.97,1922.32,1925.723,Chair and thanks for the presentation today and thank you Mr. chair for bringing forward this pleasant Gelation.,50,,
222,0.97,1925.723,1954.419,"As we chatted yesterday, I mentioned that there was an opportunity that I was trying to Eke out of the Federal funds to see if there was any way for U to continue or put a mark down to make sure that these types of supports for our smallest restaurants and folks, to try to encourage people to get outpost vaccine and enjoy our local Eateries.",50,,
223,0.97,1954.419,1969.534,Your legislation is very timely and probably a more appropriate vehicle to make sure that this program continues and that we do things necessary.,50,,
224,0.97,1969.534,1978.242,Your legislation is probably the best vehicle to make sure it continues and thanks for bringing this forward.,50,,
225,0.97,1978.242,2003.701,"One of my local brewers, optimism, who testified today had great examples of how this has been a wonderful asset for allowing them to stay afloat during this time and as patrons around the city have noted, this is something that I think encourages people to want to get back out, especially since we want to enjoy nice days and when there is cover, hide from the rain.",50,,
226,0.97,2003.701,2011.376,There is a concern around timing.,50,,
227,0.97,2011.376,2018.449,Are there things would like to fly for us with Stakeholder discussions that may be the top two or three issues you hope to address as you have Stakeholder engagement?,50,,
228,0.97,2018.449,2027.892,What are the concerns to get the understanding with policy solutions?,50,,
229,0.97,2027.892,2031.929,Thanks for that question.,51,,
230,0.97,2031.929,2045.443,"One thing we want to do is hear from all of our businesses, not just people participating in the program.",51,,
231,0.97,2045.443,2053.818,"You know, more broadly, the business districts to understand the different needs and wants of the entire community.",51,,
232,0.97,2053.818,2072.403,One of the issues that comes up is around parking and the loss of parking and the impact that businesses feel about that loss and trying to understand how to think about that.,51,,
233,0.97,2072.403,2080.011,"During the pandemic, we really saw a need to work and activate as much outdoor space as we could so that businesses have an available spot to serve customers.",51,,
234,0.97,2080.011,2091.222,We have worked closely with our colleagues in the Curbscapes management group.,51,,
235,0.97,2091.222,2102.6,They've done a good job so far and that is one of the balances we need to strike is between the parking and the activation use and considering what the temperature is among the community for that.,51,,
236,0.97,2102.6,2110.675,That is one main thing.,51,,
237,0.97,2110.675,2118.95,"You know, I think businesses that have been participating or want to will be interested in the fees part of it and what we want to have with the fee framework, moving forward.",51,,
238,0.97,2118.95,2134.332,"The other thing I would say is that we are curious if we should add more tools to our Toolbox, or permitting Toolkit, so to speak.",51,,
239,0.97,2134.332,2150.848,We've seen temporary curb space Cafcs pop up and we have a permanent program for Streateries and Parklets but we have a dozen or so permanent Parklets where we have the curb space Cafcs.,51,,
240,0.97,2150.848,2161.325,How might that frame new options for temporary uses over the summer and adding more design and permanence.,51,,
241,0.97,2161.325,2177.775,We may need more options for temporary use and am curious to explore that concept with the business community.,51,,
242,0.97,2177.775,2186.217,"Very well said, Alyse and I look forward to the discussion about additional tools in our Toolbelt to help businesses in our city.",52,,
243,0.97,2186.217,2190.288,"Council member Lewis, I still see your hand.",52,,
244,0.97,2190.288,2191.222,Is that an old hand?,52,,
245,0.97,2191.222,2194.759,It is an old hand.,53,,
246,0.97,2194.759,2196.193,All right.,54,,
247,0.97,2196.193,2202.767,"I have a couple of questions, Alyse and Vic-Chair Mosqueda got to some of it.",54,,
248,0.97,2202.767,2211.709,"I've heard from many businesses, that this saved them over the last year.",54,,
249,0.97,2211.709,2226.724,"You know, the flexibility to use their outside spaces serving customers during the changing realities of the Covid- 19 pandemic has provided them that lifeline because the public health is changing and they can still use the outdoor spaces.",54,,
250,0.97,2226.724,2231.228,Could you share feedback that you've heard from businesses about what is going well and what is not going well?,54,,
251,0.97,2231.228,2231.462,Yes.,55,,
252,0.97,2231.462,2247.878,"I've heard similar input, Councilmember Strauss, as far as businesses that have benefited from using the outdoor space.",55,,
253,0.97,2247.878,2253.017,We've seen a lot of people thinking that they are really critical to the success of the business.,55,,
254,0.97,2253.017,2281.245,"We obviously haven't received a lot of negative feedback . When we have, it has been around the loss of parking and just the Prioritization of activation and Streatery use over parking and we have been working to make sure that there is a clear path for loading.",55,,
255,0.97,2281.245,2285.883,We are still looking at loading when we think about activating the curb.,55,,
256,0.97,2285.883,2291.322,"In general, we haven't received a lot of negative comments, to date but that's one of the reasons we want the robust outreach process.",55,,
257,0.97,2291.322,2308.105,We hear from people that are really happy or those who don't have permits and may want them and what their barriers are and why they are not applying and businesses that might not see a need for this and will have concerns and work through that.,55,,
258,0.97,2308.105,2329.16,We are excited to have this extension because we could businesses who might not have applied an opportunity to make use of this over the summer months and into next year because there might be concerns if they know it expires in October.,55,,
259,0.97,2329.16,2332.329,Do they want to make the investments this summer?,55,,
260,0.97,2332.329,2344.542,"I'm excited to work throughout the spring and summer to get more interest in the program we have now, the pilot program, so to speak and it will also help inform the permanent program development.",55,,
261,0.97,2344.542,2345.142,Back thank you and well said.,55,,
262,0.97,2345.142,2346.31,Vice-Chair Mosqueda?,55,,
263,0.97,2346.31,2356.554,"That prompted another comment that I would love to make, Mr. chair.",56,,
264,0.97,2356.554,2381.045,"Thanks for the question and thanks for the answer, Alyse . I echo the other comments about the desire to continue to see decreased parking slots, overall and this is a great example of how to activate that space and potentially create additional revenue by generating more economic activity for these smallest businesses, which will help the city, et cetera.",56,,
265,0.97,2381.045,2393.524,"As we think about ways to address the loss of parking spaces, making it safer to walk and bike is critical in making it more accessible to get on transit is important.",56,,
266,0.97,2393.524,2398.596,I hope the Stakeholder outreach involves a more robust and Holistic discussion about alternatives to those parking spaces.,56,,
267,0.97,2398.596,2414.879,I felt like that needed to be said because parking and the consequence of losing that space has come up a few times but I want to lift up why it's important to replace those parking spaces.,56,,
268,0.97,2414.879,2432.63,"As I say that, something came up over the last few years, Pre- Covid, but important with a Post-Covid recovery and that is creating spaces for our musicians and artists to have a space to unload or Park their vehicles.",56,,
269,0.97,2432.63,2468.065,"Probably more important to make sure they don't have to run out and pay the meter midway through their gig and recognize that in many cases, artists are not earning large incomes and having to pay a certain portion, whether $15 or $30 on parking really eats into potential revenue for those artists and musicians and one thing that has come up from that community is having the space in front of certain business areas or districts that allows them to have free parking.",56,,
270,0.97,2468.065,2481.412,"That is potentially something to add to your list of Stakeholder strategies or discussions, more places for musicians to unload heavy equipment, like drums and make sure they can get in and out where they hopefully can play music very soon and patrons can enjoy it.",56,,
271,0.97,2481.412,2493.257,That allows them to not have to pay their income back to the city in the form of parking fees.,56,,
272,0.97,2493.257,2497.695,I thought it was a good opportunity to marry those two concepts today.,56,,
273,0.97,2497.695,2498.229,"Will said, Vice-Chair.",57,,
274,0.97,2498.229,2511.609,In addition that artists are not paid enough money to perform for the room and then to have to split that little bit of money among however many are in the band.,57,,
275,0.97,2511.609,2513.177,"Then, to have to pay parking, well said.",57,,
276,0.97,2513.177,2513.911,"Calvin,",57,,
277,0.97,2513.911,2523.787,"Council members, one of the issues that you are raising is the Issu of thresholds.",58,,
278,0.97,2523.787,2543.541,"It's one thing when one individual business wants to pursue a permit and that is generally how we have tended to work with these things but now, we have larger district impacts and what does it mean in the broader context?",58,,
279,0.97,2543.541,2550.814,"That's what this new proposal is meant to try to understand, is how do we approach the type of request and desire?",58,,
280,0.97,2550.814,2563.594,I think there's a question of threshold and how it matters to overlap with parking and with curb use.,58,,
281,0.97,2563.594,2579.076,It remains to be seen how far this will go and there's a lot of things you could approach and we have to get something that they can implement and it may be incremental because it is a lot of interest in expanding the scope of this.,58,,
282,0.97,2579.076,2602.299,"Well said, Calvin and Vice- chair Mosqueda brought up urban dollars as an avenue to make this a permanent feature and I want to highlight that there is a need for Federal relief to this program because public space management is a Fee-Based operation of the fees it generates.",59,,
283,0.97,2602.299,2614.578,"For Elise and her team to continue operating, they have been operating at a deficit because we have not been charging businesses for these permits.",59,,
284,0.97,2614.578,2626.09,It's a high priority of mine to have them receive these dollars.,59,,
285,0.97,2626.09,2626.957,Great t talk to about that yesterday.,59,,
286,0.97,2626.957,2627.925,"Alyse, two more questions.",59,,
287,0.97,2627.925,2641.472,You've been hearing much from me from January and the step we are taking today is the right next step.,59,,
288,0.97,2641.472,2648.045,Can you speak to some of the reasons why the intermediate step is before it and the permit program and what are some of the key considerations?,59,,
289,0.97,2648.045,2652.216,Yes.,60,,
290,0.97,2652.216,2674.505,"Councilmember Strauss, like I mentioned, expanding it is the right decision at this point in time because we already in May and these permits are expiring in October and what we've heard is the importance of certainty in the business community and we want to provide that.",60,,
291,0.97,2674.505,2688.285,"While this doesn't give them permanent long-term certainty, it does give them the additional benefit of time and they know they will have that investment and it will be there for them.",60,,
292,0.97,2688.285,2703.0,"It also allows us more time to do equitable outreach and engagement and as well, another benefit is to do more promotion of existing programs now, ahead of the sunny weather.",60,,
293,0.97,2703.0,2719.95,"If we were trying to do it all before October, I think we would end up doing a lot more outreach on what is next, as opposed to having the time to talk to businesses and to encourage them to reply and review those applications that, in.",60,,
294,0.97,2719.95,2722.786,"So, I think that is kind of why I support the extension.",60,,
295,0.97,2722.786,2743.44,"I have spoken a bit to some of the things we need to talk about and for one, I want to hear, listen and understand what the pulse of business communities are and what different advocacy groups are thinking about this, the disability rights advocates and other Stakeholders Besides businesses and residents.",60,,
296,0.97,2743.44,2753.65,I want to hear from as many as we can because it's more powerful when you hear from other people and aren't working too quickly.,60,,
297,0.97,2753.65,2764.828,"Again, the extension allows us to do a more robust and thorough job reaching out to communities we might not otherwise hear from if we aren't doing a thorough job.",60,,
298,0.97,2764.828,2774.838,That will help inform some of the characteristics or questions we need to engage John to think about that permanent program.,60,,
299,0.97,2774.838,2784.648,"For me, it's about Prioritizing activation, parking and unloading and considering the Curbspace allocation question.",60,,
300,0.97,2784.648,2792.489,It's about design and if we want more specifications on the design requirements we expect and then the permitting Toolbox of options.,60,,
301,0.97,2792.489,2806.937,We want to add to the Toolkit of options with more options for temporary uses in that kind of thing in the fees would be the last thing I would say.,60,,
302,0.97,2806.937,2811.775,"Those are the big buckets and hopefully, I'm not forgetting something but that's what I expect we would get to.",60,,
303,0.97,2811.775,2819.416,Excellent and thank you.,61,,
304,0.97,2819.416,2824.855,"I send my appreciation for continuing to review permits, rather than doing the outreach.",61,,
305,0.97,2824.855,2831.495,That has enabled more businesses to utilize these permits.,61,,
306,0.97,2831.495,2847.544,"The certainty that we are providing in this legislation will give businesses the green light to invest in outdoor spaces and give them a longer runway to recover . businesses using outdoor space impacts a lot of people, not just was using it.",61,,
307,0.97,2847.544,2855.819,"This is why we need to ensure all perspectives are considered, as you mentioned with the outreach program, as we make permanent changes.",61,,
308,0.97,2855.819,2866.964,"What is the process for establishing the permanent program? I know what it is, I'm asking Rhetorically and what Stakeholder voices do we need to make sure are heard?",61,,
309,0.97,2866.964,2886.316,"Well, I want to work with our colleagues in the office of economic development to make sure we have a robust list of businesses and districts and other advocacy groups to represent not just food service but a variety of different businesses.",62,,
310,0.97,2886.316,2910.907,I also want to work with them to help here from different Geographies and businesses that might have less official bias and make sure we are getting the word out that we potentially are translating outreach materials and working to have a campaign that hits everyone with a business in the city of Seattle.,62,,
311,0.97,2910.907,2915.779,That's one bucket and then I really think disability rights advocates are important to talk to to understand what they've been seeing.,62,,
312,0.97,2915.779,2934.364,We have worked to create a Video that we have on our Website that talks about the importance of making sure you keep the sidewalk clear for people using Wheelchairs or Canes and we will work with them on permanent programs in the Stakeholder bucket.,62,,
313,0.97,2934.364,2952.149,"Those come to mind . There probably are more but I'm interested in hearing from the general public with people who might not be a business owner but what they are enjoying about these spaces, and hearing from that.",62,,
314,0.97,2952.149,2968.765,We will work to share the word more broadly and to understand if there are other groups they would recommend that we continue to make sure we reach with our outreach.,62,,
315,0.97,2968.765,2975.872,"And I welcome feedback from you all, if you have suggestions for people to make sure to talk to.",62,,
316,0.97,2975.872,2987.184,"Of course, there is a strong equity team, internally, a very good resource for these locations that I know people want investigated or looked into.",63,,
317,0.97,2987.184,3038.735,"It's clear that you have given this much thought and with that, I would like to move my amendment 1, which does add a new section to allow existing permit holders, existing long term permit holders through May 31 to be consistent with the free permit program and as well, outlining the dates in which we will receive a draft proposal by December 15 to make sure no one has to work over the holiday break, to make sure that gets in and then a legislative proposal due March 31, 2022 to give us time to pass the permanent changes that need to be made before this legislation before us expires Memorial day 2022.",64,,
318,0.97,3038.735,3045.075,The current legislation expires six months from now and this gives us about 54 weeks of time before the next legislation would expire.,64,,

365,0.97,3319.282,3366.663,"As Councilmember Strauss mentioned, Councilmember Strauss and Councilmember Juarez were working on a proposal to replace the ongoing temporary moratorium on redevelopment of mobile home parks . The moratorium was initially established in 2019 through ordinance 125764 with the instant cause of that moratorium that reduced pressure on the city's two remaining mobile home parks at the time it was up for sale and potential purchasers were looking at redevelopment proposals for that mobile home park.",85,,

370,0.97,3413.71,3429.926,They are in the southeast corner of the urban village and zoning is commercial and there is some confusion about what the actual zoning is because official city maps don't reflect the correct zoning.,85,,
371,0.97,3429.926,3441.104,The Council intended to keep the zoning and see letter 140 and made that recommendation through the committee process.,85,,
372,0.97,3441.104,3451.648,"Unfortunately, it was not reflected in the final piece of legislation acted on by Council and the zoning is se 155 M, informing the overlay concept as a regulatory approach.",85,,

376,0.97,3482.378,3513.81,"If Council members have any questions, I should mention that as you all know, residential urban villages have growth estimates, not targets, but estimates of how much growth may occur in the urban village over the 20-year planning period and bitter Lake is well on its way to achieve the growth target, about 30% of the growth target achieved in the six years of the 20-year planning period.",85,,
377,0.97,3513.81,3517.413,"So, how do other jurisdictions preserve mobile home parks?",85,,
378,0.97,3517.413,3519.516,Is not unique to Seattle.,85,,

384,0.97,3576.873,3585.415,"It would establish, for the interest of Demystifying some jargon, you might wonder what is an overlay or folks might wonder what is an overlay.",85,,
385,0.97,3585.415,3589.519,It's supplemental and a more restrictive set of standards on top of the underlying zoning.,85,,
386,0.97,3589.519,3597.627,They Overlie the underlying zoning.,85,,
387,0.97,3597.627,3621.184,"Seattle has many overlay districts and the one most familiar is the shoreline overlay district, a set of more restrictive standards in place in the shoreline to preserve it for water dependent on water related uses and that overlay implements the shoreline as an overlay that the city Operationalizes on behalf of the state and every jurisdiction in Washington has that.",85,,
388,0.97,3621.184,3628.658,"Councilmember Juarez, would you like to ask your question now or wait until the end?",86,,
389,0.97,3628.658,3635.531,"I want to make a clarification, Ketil Freeman.",87,,
390,0.97,3635.531,3650.179,"When people are watching, it isn't just a mobile home Park, these are manufactured mobile home parks in which they are actually homes that are cemented down with a pad in which people took out loans to buy their homes and they lease it.",87,,
391,0.97,3650.179,3671.034,"What we were hearing in the last two years with the public comment, all the hearings we've had a on the residents coming down from Bella-Bee and Halcion, they made it clear that the visits we have physically made, they are not trailer courts, they are actually manufactured homes and that is a big distinction and I want to make sure we are clear on that.",87,,
392,0.97,3671.034,3678.174,Absolutely and you are correct.,88,,
393,0.97,3678.174,3691.821,"Of course, the associated difficulty with relocating those mobile homes is if they are old, the manufactured home is old, relocation is not really an option and would ultimately result in the destruction of the Mobile home.",88,,
394,0.97,3691.821,3692.121,Correct.,89,,
395,0.97,3692.121,3694.657,There just like a home.,89,,
396,0.97,3694.657,3701.798,"If they don't make payments on their mortgage, they would not actually be moving around.",89,,
397,0.97,3701.798,3706.702,They are cemented down as homes.,89,,
398,0.97,3706.702,3718.414,It would limit residential uses to mobile homes and mobile home parks and that would be the only kind of residential use allowed in the overlay zone.,89,,
399,0.97,3718.414,3729.092,It would establish a minimum and maximum residential density for mobile home parks in the overlay and would allow some commercial uses.,89,,
400,0.97,3729.092,3737.1,"As mentioned earlier, the zoning is commercial and it would limit the size.",89,,
401,0.97,3737.1,3760.656,"There would be setback limitations to make that consistent with ongoing mobile home park residential use and the would be development standards if it was Redeveloped, specifically if someone Redeveloped a portion of the park above a 25% threshold, they would be providing amenities for local residents.",89,,
402,0.97,3760.656,3761.958,The mobile home park would be temporary.,89,,
403,0.97,3761.958,3773.169,The overlay would be temporary and wouldn't last forever.,89,,
404,0.97,3773.169,3786.182,The CPO analysis contemplated a period of up to 50 years with legislation introduced this coming week to have a period of less than that.,89,,
405,0.97,3786.182,3807.136,"There's one other piece with a Non-Codified section of the bill, it requests that the office of housing had this particular census tract that was eligible for the affirmative marketing and right to return policies, elected policies with applicants to the city for affordable housing funds that they can choose to participate in.",89,,
406,0.97,3807.136,3819.682,Bitter Lake is eligible for designation for those policies because it is an area identified in the comprehensive plan as being at high risk of displacement.,89,,
407,0.97,3819.682,3835.097,"Next, the CPO period will end on May 17 with the public hearing currently scheduled for the Committee on May 26th.",89,,
408,0.97,3835.097,3850.746,"I mentioned that the current moratorium expires July 10th and consequently, if the Council wanted to enact something to be affected before that expiration, a full council vote should happen no later than June 2ND.",89,,
409,0.97,3850.746,3855.651,That's the presentation and I'm happy to answer any questions you guys might have.,89,,
410,0.97,3855.651,3858.187,"Thank you, Mr. Freeman.",90,,
411,0.97,3858.187,3859.255,"Councilmember Juarez, is that a new hand?",90,,
412,0.97,3859.255,3864.76,"That is my Indian name, new hand.",91,,
413,0.97,3864.76,3870.967,"Hey, Ketil, when we looked at the memos you had written, could we clarify something?",91,,
414,0.97,3870.967,3874.37,Was it the Tumwater or the Bothell case.,91,,
415,0.97,3874.37,3877.44,"With the overlay, there are particular uses that can be in addition to, correct?",91,,
416,0.97,3877.44,3880.576,"Yeah, that's correct.",92,,
417,0.97,3880.576,3898.961,"The jurisdictions, Tumwater, they allow uses in addition to mobile homes and the circumstances are a little bit different for many of those mobile home parks.",92,,
418,0.97,3898.961,3906.369,I believe many of them are in residential areas as opposed to the commercial area.,92,,
419,0.97,3906.369,3916.312,"The types of uses that would otherwise be allowed in those, in Tumwater and Bothell and Kenmore, they are the uses you would generally find in a residential area.",92,,
420,0.97,3916.312,3934.43,"Schools, institutions, Daycares, Childcare, In-Home senior care or senior living homes are all uses that are allowed under the regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions.",92,,
421,0.97,3934.43,3939.402,Those are some of the concerns we've heard from people that live there.,93,,
422,0.97,3939.402,3947.343,"If complementary uses under the law and it's not just manufactured mobile homes, but uses the people could actually use?",93,,
423,0.97,3947.343,3948.811,That's right.,94,,
424,0.97,3948.811,3952.782,"It's successor uses that would be allowed, as well.",94,,
425,0.97,3952.782,3963.359,"For example, if a mobile home park operator wanted to expand a laundry or recreational facility within the Mobile home Park, there would be no limitation on that activity.",94,,
426,0.97,3963.359,3966.762,"When you talked about the Tumwater, was that the lower part case?",95,,
427,0.97,3966.762,3967.563,"Yes, I believe so.",96,,
428,0.97,3967.563,3967.83,Okay.,97,,
429,0.97,3967.83,3968.331,Thank you.,97,,

431,0.97,3976.038,3976.505,Very good questions.,98,,
432,0.97,3976.505,3985.781,Hoping to clarify some of what has been discussed.,98,,
433,0.97,3985.781,3988.084,"One thing to highlight, Councilmember Juarez pointed out, that these are for manufactured homes.",98,,
434,0.97,3988.084,3994.89,"In effect, you can get a mortgage.",98,,
435,0.97,3994.89,4010.239,"You own that home, it is cemented to a foundation and when they are old, if they are moved, they could be destroyed.",98,,
436,0.97,4010.239,4026.188,"While you own the manufactured home, you do not necessarily own the and underneath you and you could be paying a mortgage on the home and you don't own the land and if you had to move that manufactured home, it would be destroyed.",98,,
437,0.97,4026.188,4031.827,That is the crux of what we are talking about.,98,,

546,0.97,4810.172,4834.563,"We also are moving to the platform for application with the issuance process for permits and that necessitated rewriting some of the municipal code and then we are changing areas to a Gender-Neutral language, previously called the steam and boiler firemen operator license law and we are not calling at that.",125,,
547,0.97,4834.563,4839.367,It's the firemen license law changed to the steam and boiler operator language throughout this code.,125,,

555,0.97,4888.85,4903.865,"The primary ones, there is a correction to the plumbing fixture table and it identifies the requirements for providing plumbing fixtures and there was a column that was missing that we wanted to get in as quickly as possible.",125,,
556,0.97,4903.865,4906.001,Other corrections or changes to language.,125,,
557,0.97,4906.001,4917.279,We had minor errors like we had and and it should have been a war or something similar to that and then other omissions.,125,,
558,0.97,4917.279,4935.43,We verified some code references in various sections of the code Referenced sections that haven't been corrected and we had language with state changes we adopted that was not identical and we wanted to make sure we got that corrected and that is what this Aranda legislation does.,125,,

563,0.97,4957.018,4961.99,Can you remind us the difference between these code changes and the construction and energy codes?,126,,
564,0.97,4961.99,4984.946,"These code changes, it doesn't stand by itself and there is the grading code that is part of the title 22--excuse me--there are so many of them--I have to keep them straight.",127,,
565,0.97,4984.946,4991.987,The boiler license laws are separate.,127,,
566,0.97,4991.987,5005.633,"The grading code is part of the Seattle municipal code title 22 in the construction code Errata are various Errata to energy and there is one where it was a minor omission and have some from the building code, as well.",127,,

569,0.97,5020.115,5030.091,"I don't anticipate code updates but if there is anything that should come forward, it would be additional Errata but I'm hoping we captured the majority of those.",129,,
570,0.97,5030.091,5033.695,I do not anticipate that before the end of the year.,129,,
571,0.97,5033.695,5044.272,Having a meeting to dive deeper into this would be helpful.,130,,
