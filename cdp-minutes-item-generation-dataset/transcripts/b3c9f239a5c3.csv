98,0.97,973.539,980.512,You will hear repeatedly this bill is singled out Israel.,12,,
99,0.97,980.512,989.788,This decades old form is used anyone who tries to hold Israel accountable for human rights violations.,12,,

119,0.97,1081.313,1097.463,I want to make it clear I support the member pushed by Councilmember Sawant which would make this a standard for international law and human rights around the world that they could not find a loophole for.,16,,
120,0.97,1097.463,1113.479,And you will hear a lot today from people who are against this legislation who say this is singling out Israel and that SPD needs to train with countries that violate human rights.,16,,
121,0.97,1113.479,1116.548,That is false and I completely reject it.,16,,
122,0.97,1116.548,1116.849,Thank you.,16,,

132,0.97,1147.145,1149.648,You can put me down for just general public comment.,22,,
133,0.97,1149.648,1151.116,I wasn't sure what that meant.,22,,
134,0.97,1151.116,1151.383,Cool.,23,,

141,0.97,1195.427,1208.34,But I just learned that CHEM perfect Strauss is proposing a hostile amendment that would create a giant loophole and allow some of the worst human rights Violators to train with the Seattle police Department.,24,,
142,0.97,1208.34,1225.424,I thank the Councilmembers who roundly reject it and vote no on Strauss's amendment and vote yes on the bill supported by Morales and Mosqueda.,24,,
143,0.97,1225.424,1233.198,Thank you.,25,,

149,0.97,1256.021,1261.46,Passing this bill is an easy way to respect the human rights of all people.,26,,

162,0.97,1328.06,1337.369,It's clear that SPD should not train with Countrys that are under investigation for genocide and crimes against humanity no matter the content and topic.,28,,

178,0.97,1463.929,1469.501,Now Councilmember Sawant found another way to attack Israel.,32,,
179,0.97,1469.501,1481.413,Her underhanded amendments redefined the scope of investigation of the International criminal force applied to industrial which was always the intended target.,32,,
180,0.97,1481.413,1509.04,Councilmember Sawant is inventing international law creating an imaginary human rights doctrine and this bill will be Weaponized against Israel and making the Seattle Jewish community targets.,32,,

192,0.97,1580.512,1589.187,Go ahead.,35,,
193,0.97,1589.487,1596.995,"Jeremy, I am showing that you are Unmuted.",35,,

198,0.97,1601.166,1604.035,Hi.,36,,
199,0.97,1604.035,1625.523,"I'm Jeremy Voss, a Jewish resident of district two, and I'm speaking in favor of 120142 to end the deadly exchange and please support Councilmember Sawant's amendment so SPD cannot use any loopholes to continue to use these types of training.",36,,
200,0.97,1625.523,1656.121,"These Trainings are bad for the indigenous communities in partner countries and Seattle, and they are a place where SPD can sharpen and extend their Bro tall and surveillance and O Pregz of Seattle protesters, and even to the expense that a theoretical training could not include tactics, they still Legitimize the brutality of both countries by treating them as groups that the other could look up to.",36,,
201,0.97,1656.121,1657.222,Yeah.,36,,
202,0.97,1657.222,1677.242,Please support Sawant's amendment to support the legislation as a whole.,36,,
203,0.97,1678.877,1679.11,Thank you.,36,,

206,0.97,1701.499,1701.766,Go ahead.,37,,
207,0.97,1701.766,1702.233,Hi.,38,,
208,0.97,1702.233,1705.236,Hi.,38,,
209,0.97,1705.236,1728.593,"I am Clara, a Jewish resident of district two and grew up in the community and speaking in favor of the bill 120142 and specifically Councilmember Sawant's proposed amendment to it which would make it legally enforce obviously and close the loopholes to allow SPD to continue the Trainings.",38,,
210,0.97,1728.593,1744.275,These Trainings address the international community around the issues of human rights and the Mistreatment of minority groups and Militarize SPD further which endangers our own community and specifically the black members of our community.,38,,
211,0.97,1744.275,1757.522,So the Council has an opportunity in this moment to create legislation that can be used to help our city end this and be used as a model for other cities around the country.,38,,
212,0.97,1757.522,1768.767,So the Council should vote yes on bill 120142 and specifically support Councilmember Sawant's amendment to it to strengthen the legal clearance.,38,,
213,0.97,1768.767,1783.848,"Thanks for calling in today, and next up.",39,,
214,0.97,1783.982,1784.415,Good afternoon.,40,,

216,0.97,1801.533,1808.306,Spd should never be training with security forces with countries with violations of human rights.,40,,
217,0.97,1808.306,1826.09,"I don't believe there is a scenario where the Seattle police increases public safety by training abroad with other armed forces, and it's important not to leave loopholes with that because they have trained before and I am sure they will again unless we prevent it.",40,,
218,0.97,1826.09,1832.33,"No matter what name is given to the exchanges, they are dangerous and unnecessary at best.",40,,
219,0.97,1832.33,1839.737,Let's be sure the policy can be the strongest model legislation that is clear and coherent.,40,,
220,0.97,1839.737,1840.038,Thank you.,40,,
221,0.97,1840.171,1851.316,Thank you for calling this today.,41,,

225,0.97,1855.019,1868.666,I live in district four and speaking in support of Spg 120142 which would make it illegal for the Seattle police Department to train with any country that violates human rights.,42,,
226,0.97,1868.666,1892.323,"As a Jewish Seattle resident, I find this upsetting and this would protect the rights of the Seattle residents, and we cannot falsely equate protecting human rights with anti-Semitism.",42,,
227,0.97,1892.323,1905.536,Please reject Councilmember Strauss's amendment and support Councilmember Sawant's agreement.,42,,
228,0.97,1905.536,1921.052,We need to move away from military policing and set your city to invest in Community-Led safety.,42,,

238,0.97,2036.1,2044.609,And it's particularly outrageous that Councilmember Strauss brought this forward at 2:00 P.M.,44,,
239,0.97,2044.609,2048.279,Today and prevent our movement from being able to respond.,44,,
240,0.97,2048.279,2057.755,And I urge the Council to support this legislation and oppose policy violence against black Americans and Palestinians alike.,44,,

250,0.97,2090.321,2101.732,We believe that every--this measure is not the solution to disproportionate police violence against black and Brown people including black and Brown Jews.,46,,
251,0.97,2101.732,2108.372,We appreciate the attempt to improve the bill but it's still harmful.,46,,
252,0.97,2108.372,2114.812,The definition of training and partnership are still vague leaving room for unintended consequences.,46,,
253,0.97,2114.812,2141.272,It still prohibits SPD from working with other U.S. law enforcement agents which is problematic and while a specific reference to Israel was removed it's clear that the attempt behind the flawed legislation is to find a way for Seattle to boycott Israel and not improve the real and current problems.,46,,
254,0.97,2141.272,2141.672,Please vote now.,46,,
255,0.97,2141.672,2147.311,Thanks for calling in and see if we can get Alicia Lewis on the line.,47,,

261,0.97,2153.217,2189.654,I am also calling to demand that city council listen to hundreds of rank and file organizers to pass the deadly exchange legislation with Councilmember Sawant's amendment and rejecting the last minute amendment from Councilmember Strauss that would allow SPD to train with police with the human rights Violators around the world and could train with Israeli police and Israel or in the United States which is how the deadly exchanges happen.,48,,
262,0.97,2189.654,2197.228,The Adl sponsors training that brings Israeli human rights Abusers to the U.S. to train U.S. police.,48,,

270,0.97,2272.803,2276.107,That's at the core of this.,50,,
271,0.97,2276.107,2280.945,And who are police accountable to.,50,,
272,0.97,2280.945,2293.391,"Since George Floyd, they have failed to hold police available, and I think people should have a clear say in how police are training and how officers are hired and fired.",50,,

280,0.97,2345.609,2361.392,I am deeply concerned that Councilmember Strauss is proposing an amendment that would allow SPD to train with the police from the worst human rights Violators around the world.,52,,

579,0.97,4700.462,4713.642,"As a woman and for that reason alone, I am struggling to believe this legislation even being considered.",124,,
580,0.97,4713.642,4716.745,Please vote new on this legislation.,124,,
581,0.97,4716.745,4720.982,It will not fix the Deep-Rooted problems in our system of policing.,124,,

589,0.97,4789.551,4799.728,Council bill 120157.,126,,
590,0.97,4799.728,4824.686,"An ordinance relating to affordable housing on properties owned or controlled by religious organizations, modifying Affordability requirements adopted in ordinance 126384 and mending section 234-2055 of the Seattle municipal code and section 10 of ordinance 126384.",126,,
591,0.97,4824.686,4847.209,"And technology is not our friend, and Councilmember Strauss is not with us--Okay, and Councilmember Strauss is now with us, and Councilmember Strauss will provide us with introductory remarks before we have the public hearing and we have a handful of people registered to make public comments.",127,,

593,0.97,4849.711,4857.686,Thank you very much to Councilmember Gonzalez and apologies for the technology issues that we experienced.,128,,
594,0.97,4857.686,4883.144,I want to highlight that Council bill 120157 is before us and makes changes to bill 120-0881 that the city council passed on June 28 and Inies Acrossed the affordable requirements from 80 percent AMI to 80 percent AMI.,128,,
595,0.97,4883.144,4892.887,120881 allowed larger buildings for affordable housing developments on site owned or controlled by religious institution.,128,,
596,0.97,4892.887,4913.108,"Affordable housing is affordable to 80 percent AMI as did the original version of 120157 that was transmitted to Council, and the neighborhood committee considered the amendment and lowered the AMI requirements to 60 percent and decided against and rejected that amendment after hearing from Stakeholders.",128,,
597,0.97,4913.108,4921.483,The city council passed the similar amendment and lowered the requirements to 60 percent AMI making Seattle's law more restrictive to the state law.,128,,
598,0.97,4921.483,4944.506,My office and others were connected by churches and other community organizations expressing deep concerns with the amendment which works--it includes the Nehemiah initiative that works with historically black churches in the area and save the churches.,128,,
599,0.97,4944.506,4965.727,"And this ensured that the 60 percent AMI requirement threatened the viability of the church affordable housing project meaning that we would use the affordable housing under this ordinance, and I heard that churches planned to use this ordinance in ways that is more broad than the city council discussed during full council.",128,,
600,0.97,4965.727,4973.301,And churches may wish to build affordable housing to allow residents to return to communities they were already displaced from.,128,,
601,0.97,4973.301,4977.572,And some of these may not qualify for 60 percent AMI and they have been displaced.,128,,
602,0.97,4977.572,4985.547,I don't think the city needs to Micromanage how the organizations best serve their congregation.,128,,
603,0.97,4985.547,4993.788,"And finally, I was reminded of the great importance of the black church as more than just a religious organization.",128,,
604,0.97,4993.788,5033.762,"It's seen, as the largest African-American financial, emotional, physical spiritual service provider and the largest African-American Landowner, period, and he added much more, and I know many more people will be speaking during the public hearing today and I will end with this, noting that the legislation will mend the previous Council bill to provide more flexibility to churches to serve their congregation and build affordable housing and maintain themselves financially to ton--continue to serve their community.",128,,
605,0.97,5033.762,5034.662,Thank you Councilmembers.,128,,
606,0.97,5034.662,5045.573,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, information for the public and us Councilmembers.",129,,
607,0.97,5045.573,5060.088,"As presiding officer, I am opening the Gunnel Council, and I will call on speakers in the order of registration.",129,,

609,0.97,5064.726,5069.731,The same rules that applied to the public comments will be applied to this public hearing.,129,,
610,0.97,5069.731,5084.512,"Each Speaker will be provided up to two minutes to address the Council, and speakers will hear a Chime when they only have 10 seconds left of the allotted time.",129,,

613,0.97,5109.504,5110.805,"Sorry, folks.",129,,
614,0.97,5110.805,5113.575,I am experiencing Internet instability.,129,,
615,0.97,5113.575,5132.427,"I will turn my camera off, and public comment for this section is only related to the Council bill just described by Councilmember Strauss, the bill related to affordable housing on property owned or controlled by religious organizations.",129,,
616,0.97,5132.427,5153.214,We will go ahead and open up the public comment period and call on folks that present and signed up to speak on this subject matter.,129,,

618,0.97,5156.251,5156.684,Good afternoon.,130,,
619,0.97,5156.684,5185.48,"I live in district one and I am on staff at the American Institute of architects, and I am speaking ahead of the fellow of the AIA and support Council bill 120157 and appreciate the Council's willingness to take a second look.",130,,
620,0.97,5185.48,5213.875,We identify policy changes that make development work for individuals and communities to combat the risk of displacement and adjusting this legislation to make it achievable for black churches to participate in the program without giving up control to developers is example of this policy adjustment and supports the city's commitment to racial equality.,130,,
621,0.97,5213.875,5229.724,And while programs are essential and needed to achieve additional city goals we need the goals should be addressed and ask you to support Council bill 120157.,130,,
622,0.97,5229.724,5245.34,"Thank you, and next up Donald King followed by Joey Lopez.",131,,
623,0.97,5245.473,5255.75,Good afternoon.,132,,
624,0.97,5264.225,5265.36,This is done to ALD King.,132,,
625,0.97,5265.36,5267.395,I am president and Ceo of the Nehemiah --,132,,
626,0.97,5267.395,5269.564,"Again, you have to press--we are all having--let's start the clock over again.",133,,
627,0.97,5269.564,5271.599,And I feel like this is an extra Monday.,133,,
628,0.97,5271.599,5272.233,You have the full two minutes.,133,,
629,0.97,5272.233,5272.5,Go ahead.,133,,
630,0.97,5272.5,5275.603,Thank you.,134,,
631,0.97,5275.603,5291.119,"I am Donald King and president and Ceo of the Nehemiah initiative, and it's the initiative to one, safety historically black churches and predominantly black churches of central Seattle.",134,,
632,0.97,5291.119,5294.656,As part of that mission we have two objectives in mind.,134,,
633,0.97,5294.656,5301.696,One is to develop affordable housing on under utilized properties of the churches which is quite abundant.,134,,
634,0.97,5301.696,5309.671,And the second is to provide the church with income from the development of those properties for the churches to survive.,134,,
635,0.97,5309.671,5321.616,So the churches can continue to do good but also doing well financially.,134,,
636,0.97,5321.616,5336.531,"We are supporting of the passage of CB 120157 because it corrects a previously passed bill, an ordinance, 120081, that was flawed.",134,,
637,0.97,5336.531,5352.88,It had a late amendment added to it that required an eligible of 60 percent area medium income which does not particularly work for our black churches.,134,,
638,0.97,5352.88,5377.538,"We applaud those that work in the low and very low income housing provision market but with the objective that I just told you about and the second objective is to make the black churches stronger through the development of their housing, a threshold of 60 percent or a limit of 60 percent AMI does not financially work for that objective.",134,,
639,0.97,5377.538,5389.55,"So I am urging you to pass this ordinance to pass this bill into ordinance, 120157.",134,,

645,0.97,5410.938,5429.624,I appreciate the time to speak today on behalf of the Council in ordinance 120157 to modify the Affordability requirements adopted in the past ordinance that relates to affordable housing on properties owned and controlled by religious organizations.,136,,
646,0.97,5429.624,5449.444,"As many of you know, the church Council of greater Seattle is committed to making Transformational change for liberation and justice much like the Nehemiah initiative.",136,,
647,0.97,5449.444,5473.367,We facilitate a network of congregations through the save land initiative and train and development leaders to cultivate deeper relationships in the congregation and neighborhoods and the stewardship of the owned land and take action by practicing stewardship and engaging lawmakers and elected officials.,136,,
648,0.97,5473.367,5481.542,"As we work and legislate the terms of Affordability, we have to realize the people impacted.",136,,
649,0.97,5481.542,5497.725,There are families--families are what will reverse the impact of placement like the city's history of urban renewal.,136,,
650,0.97,5497.725,5504.365,"80 percent of AMI for a 3- bedroom unit is $2,225.",136,,
651,0.97,5504.365,5509.37,And the reality is housing is almost non-existent at this cost or lower.,136,,
652,0.97,5509.37,5521.749,You must be mindful of the long- term impact providing space for the return of the displaced black Renters in a way that does not contribute to racial segregation.,136,,

658,0.97,5541.369,5544.705,I'm a housing developer in Seattle.,138,,
659,0.97,5544.705,5552.246,I am here to answer the specific question which is the difference between 80 percent AMI and 80 percent AMI.,138,,
660,0.97,5552.246,5556.117,It's a difference between many homes and no homes.,138,,
661,0.97,5556.117,5581.475,"For a family of four, it's a difference of earn 63 There000 and 83 $83 83 83,000 a year, and the difference for a developer of $6100 and $2100 a month for housing.",138,,
662,0.97,5581.475,5588.316,It's the difference between being able to pay off your construction loans and not being able to do so.,138,,
663,0.97,5588.316,5597.058,"If you can pay off a loan and you are a church, there is a bit of money left over to keep your community going.",138,,
664,0.97,5597.058,5600.361,Not everyone needs to fund their operations.,138,,
665,0.97,5600.361,5608.869,"Non-Profits have accessed the Federal tax credits and subsidies and define 60 percent AMI, and they should.",138,,
666,0.97,5608.869,5621.549,"But no one, not even a church with a modest prospect should build with 60 percent AMI in Seattle.",138,,
667,0.97,5621.549,5628.723,We can offer them a chance to revitalize themselves through housing and do so on their own without subsidies.,138,,
668,0.97,5628.723,5631.926,With that you must be able to build 80 percent AMI.,138,,
669,0.97,5631.926,5632.727,Please approve this bill.,138,,
670,0.97,5632.727,5633.027,Thank you.,138,,

689,0.97,5780.207,5801.529,I'm Barbara Wilson speaking in favor of 120157 increasing the permissible AMI to 80 percent would make it financially feasible for religious institutions with less land to build missing middle housing at virtually no cost to the city.,142,,
690,0.97,5801.529,5816.41,Affordable housing would exist because of a dedicated group of historical black churches advocated for a state law for building on religious property.,142,,
691,0.97,5816.41,5819.413,Exploring building affordable housing at 60 percent AMI on our property.,142,,
692,0.97,5819.413,5832.026,We are privileged to have a very large piece of property but you should know the property for affordable housing will be reduced in value by half.,142,,
693,0.97,5832.026,5852.68,"The reality is limiting the definition of affordable housing to 60 percent AMI and below reduces the land value so much it financially prohibits for the very people that brought Seattle one solution to increase much-needed affordable housing, the blast historic churches.",142,,
694,0.97,5852.68,5862.823,"If you wish to support the black community in their historical neighborhoods, please pass 120157.",142,,

1123,0.97,8592.25,8593.251,I'm sorry.,347,,
1124,0.97,8593.251,8594.352,"Go ahead, Councilmember.",347,,
1125,0.97,8594.352,8600.224,Great.,348,,
1126,0.97,8600.224,8601.025,"Yes, that is correct.",348,,
1127,0.97,8601.025,8608.132,"If I had more time, I would have created an exemption for British Columbia as our province to the North.",348,,
1128,0.97,8608.132,8609.0,Okay.,349,,
1129,0.97,8609.0,8619.277,"Ann, would you like to answer Councilmember Strauss's question to that?",349,,
1130,0.97,8619.277,8621.279,I don't have anything to add.,350,,
1131,0.97,8621.279,8627.385,Partnerships with police forces in Canada.,350,,
1132,0.97,8627.385,8628.052,All right.,351,,
1133,0.97,8628.052,8629.787,I don't have any additional questions.,351,,
1134,0.97,8629.787,8631.289,Thank you.,351,,
1135,0.97,8631.289,8632.49,Thank you so much.,352,,
1136,0.97,8632.49,8637.395,"I see Councilmember Herbold has her hand raised, and then Councilmember Morales.",352,,
1137,0.97,8637.395,8646.938,This exclusively relates to this or a statement?,353,,
1138,0.97,8646.938,8649.374,Any comments on the proposed amendment.,354,,
1139,0.97,8649.374,8660.518,"If you had a question for central staff, you may ask that question but this is an opportunity for any and all comments on Councilmember Strauss's proposed amendment.",354,,
1140,0.97,8660.518,8661.519,Thank you.,355,,
1141,0.97,8661.519,8690.248,"To underscore the issue raised by Councilmember Lewis, we received information from central staff that from 2013 to 2021 SPD took 48 trips to Canada . to be clear, a trip is one incident of travel by a single staff member.",355,,
1142,0.97,8690.248,8706.197,"It looks like 13 trips were to attend a conference, two to provide protection, which should be exempt from this amendment, and two to support a partnership . 30 to receive training.",355,,
1143,0.97,8706.197,8743.401,"In addition to the fact that this amendment would scoop in Canada, I have spoken to Seattle police chief Diaz and understand that the Seattle police Department is currently working with agencies both in the United Kingdom and Sweden on crowd management processes, which have been along the lines of recommendations of our police accountability agencies and as drafted it appears this amendment could potentially affect this work . There are 195 nations in the world.",355,,
1144,0.97,8743.401,8756.18,I am very concerned that the impact is very broad with this amendment.,355,,
1145,0.97,8756.18,8771.629,I understand it is the intent of the amendment sponsors and it is not tied to an objective assessment of human rights violations and the human rights records.,355,,
1146,0.97,8771.629,8781.005,"I will be listening for my colleagues arguments on this, but I am unlikely to be able to support this amendment.",355,,
1147,0.97,8781.005,8783.407,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",356,,
1148,0.97,8783.407,8788.246,"Councilmember Morales, do you still have a question or comment?",356,,
1149,0.97,8788.246,8809.667,"Well, I was just pointing out as Councilmember Lewis stated, the first sentence in the last sentence seemed to say slightly different things . The first sentence is shall not participate in training programs with military forces.",357,,
1150,0.97,8809.667,8814.472,The second one goes on to say intelligence agencies or security services.,357,,
1151,0.97,8814.472,8826.684,My real question is does that matter? will the broader interpretation be what will appear here?,357,,
1152,0.97,8826.684,8838.062,"Just to be clear on my understanding, it might be relevant to sort of context for that question.",358,,
1153,0.97,8838.062,8877.501,"That language exists in the underlying legislation . only parts that are proposed to be changed are the Strikeout of a and B. the part that you are identifying that might have an inconsistency is included in the bill . Thank you, council central staff, whoever is doing this for highlighting the text in yellow . that is what Councilmember Strauss's amendment is proposing.",358,,
1154,0.97,8877.501,8885.743,Everything else is included in the base legislation that we are considering today.,358,,
1155,0.97,8885.743,8899.757,"So Council central staff, any response to that particular question as presented by Councilmember Morales?",358,,
1156,0.97,8899.757,8901.425,No.,359,,
1157,0.97,8901.425,8904.262,No response.,359,,
1158,0.97,8904.262,8906.063,I agree with her characterization generally.,359,,
1159,0.97,8906.063,8909.267,Okay.,360,,
1160,0.97,8909.267,8914.705,"Councilmember Sawant, please.",360,,
1161,0.97,8917.575,8921.979,So I have two questions.,361,,
1162,0.97,8921.979,8929.186,"It is possible that each one has already been answered, but I will ask just to make it clear.",361,,
1163,0.97,8929.186,8947.972,"My two questions are with his Van all training programs with all other countries including countries in which SPD has had training in the cast including Canada, it seems the answer is yes.",361,,
1164,0.97,8947.972,8951.008,Just to confirm that.,361,,
1165,0.97,8951.008,8963.22,"And Secondly, under this amendment, would SPD be permitted to attend training inside the United dates that includes police forces or security services of foreign countries?",361,,
1166,0.97,8963.22,8969.226,"President Gonzalez, I have comments but I will resolve them.",361,,
1167,0.97,8969.226,8970.928,"Council President, may I respond?",362,,
1168,0.97,8970.928,8972.697,And then central staff?,362,,
1169,0.97,8972.697,8986.944,"Councilmember Sawant, what I will say, as to your second question whether or not those Trainings can or cannot occur on domestic soil, that is a question left for your base bill.",362,,
1170,0.97,8986.944,8989.146,That is not under consideration for this amendment.,362,,
1171,0.97,8989.146,9000.524,This amendment simply removes the characterization of which types of countries we can work with to just say all countries.,362,,
1172,0.97,9000.524,9002.626,Otherwise it is not truly nation neutral.,362,,
1173,0.97,9002.626,9005.296,This is a nature and neutral amendment.,362,,
1174,0.97,9005.296,9008.866,And the answer to your first question is yes.,362,,
1175,0.97,9008.866,9011.736,Thank you.,362,,
1176,0.97,9011.736,9013.337,"If you have a follow-up, please.",362,,
1177,0.97,9013.337,9025.683,"In response to the first question, yes, this amendment would ban such work with Canada as SPD is currently engaged in.",363,,
1178,0.97,9025.683,9038.162,"With respect to the second question, the way I read partnerships with the military forces of any country that would exclude United States military forces.",363,,
1179,0.97,9038.162,9056.147,"All of the other descriptions of the types of units, foreign military, police forces, intelligence agencies, those have the Qualifier . The only one that is not his military forces of any country.",363,,
1180,0.97,9056.147,9060.718,I don't know if you addressed my specific question.,364,,
1181,0.97,9060.718,9067.224,It was his SPD permitted to do training inside the U.S.?,364,,
1182,0.97,9067.224,9074.498,"If that training happened on U.S. soil, training that involves police forces and security forces.",364,,
1183,0.97,9074.498,9083.007,"For example, good officers do training in Chicago to train with foreign police forces.",364,,
1184,0.97,9083.007,9104.161,"The way I read this bill, training programs, exchanges, partnerships with the police forces . to me, this does not specify geography.",365,,
1185,0.97,9104.161,9109.667,Certainly we can work to clarify that but that is the way I understand the bill is currently written.,365,,
1186,0.97,9109.667,9119.443,"This has been a process for Council that should have been taken up a committee, Councilmember Sawant . It seems you might also have questions about the base bill.",366,,
1187,0.97,9119.443,9123.481,"No, I don't have questions.",367,,
1188,0.97,9123.481,9126.05,You have provided this amendment at the very last second.,367,,
1189,0.97,9126.05,9130.287,It is the base bill that you have the question about though.,368,,
1190,0.97,9130.287,9132.857,No! absolutely not.,369,,
1191,0.97,9132.857,9140.898,Your amendment is sweeping as Councilmember Herbold alluded to . that is why these questions are coming up.,369,,
1192,0.97,9140.898,9142.9,This is not a minor amendment.,369,,
1193,0.97,9142.9,9147.404,The question you just had was about the part not highlighted.,370,,
1194,0.97,9147.404,9152.209,It is not about the base bill.,371,,
1195,0.97,9152.209,9153.744,"Council President, my apologies.",372,,
1196,0.97,9153.744,9167.691,"This is not Council breathing or committee meetings, so we need to take a pause and instead of going back and forth, if we can, you know, work hard to not interrupt each other in the spirit of having an open Democratic debate.",373,,
1197,0.97,9167.691,9181.939,I recognize and appreciate that several of these are Last- minute amendments and those of us that have not been on the committee are working hard to catch up.,373,,
1198,0.97,9181.939,9195.753,"I appreciate the opportunity for us to extend grace to each other as we are trying to catch up on some of these amendments, some of which are more substantive than others.",373,,
1199,0.97,9195.753,9204.461,"As I stated at the top, my preference is to always do these kinds of work sessions in the midst of committee work, but alas, we are in a situation now that is not the situation.",373,,
1200,0.97,9204.461,9224.381,"So, we are going to go ahead and do our best to get through all of these amendments in a way that is hopefully useful to those of us that have to make decisions on the underlying bill and on these perspective amendments . I really appreciate you all working together to hopefully achieve that.",373,,
1201,0.97,9224.381,9231.488,"Again, I want to make sure that Councilmember Sawant, you got answers to the questions that you asked?",373,,
1202,0.97,9231.488,9232.456,Not yet?,373,,
1203,0.97,9232.456,9235.993,"No, I don't think so.",374,,
1204,0.97,9235.993,9238.395,"If you don't mind, I want to follow-up.",374,,
1205,0.97,9238.395,9243.734,"Yeah, it is not clear to me actually what the impact of this amendment is.",374,,
1206,0.97,9243.734,9256.68,"Again, I do ask that question again of can SPD attend training inside the United States?",374,,
1207,0.97,9256.68,9264.421,"Ann said the amendment does not comment on that, but that is the whole point.",374,,
1208,0.97,9264.421,9266.423,There is this ambiguity that is here.,374,,
1209,0.97,9266.423,9290.247,"For example, SPD policy training session in Chicago where the Israeli police shows up . I mean, the problem is that Councilmember Strauss' amendment removes the human rights standards out of the base bill, which is the fundamental criteria for the existence of the bill.",374,,
1210,0.97,9290.247,9299.757,"By doing that, it creates ambiguity . It should have a Yes or no answer.",374,,
1211,0.97,9299.757,9306.83,Should they participate in a training session in Chicago?,374,,
1212,0.97,9306.83,9317.641,"Because of this amendment, there is ambiguity over whether or not that hypothetical Chicago trip can happen.",374,,
1213,0.97,9317.641,9366.19,"We know--I mean, at least I know and I don't know if Council members will agree, but introducing any ambiguity is problematic, which is why the base bill as amended was taking great discussion with community members to make sure we remove these ambiguities . from my standpoint, it is extremely important to not only make sure everybody is genuinely in agreement, but also because I am very much afraid given the track record, the overwhelming track record this young police Department will interpret this in a way that they want to given their established practices as opposed to what the community wants to accomplish with this legislation.",374,,
1214,0.97,9366.19,9367.591,I would really appreciate some clarity.,374,,
1215,0.97,9367.591,9367.891,Thank you.,374,,
1216,0.97,9367.891,9373.63,"Council President, may I jump in here?",375,,
1217,0.97,9373.63,9375.933,Thank you.,376,,
1218,0.97,9375.933,9381.638,"I will invite my colleague, Ann to jump in.",376,,
1219,0.97,9381.638,9386.31,Let me do a close reading of the text on the screen.,376,,
1220,0.97,9386.31,9399.723,"Sentence one in the base bill would prohibit SPD from participating in training programs, exchanges, or partnerships with the military forces of any country, or engage in the travel.",376,,
1221,0.97,9399.723,9413.337,"I read that to mean that you cannot travel to the country to engage with military forces, nor can you participate within the United States training.",376,,
1222,0.97,9413.337,9430.154,"Certainly the base bill would prohibit SPD's participation in any training programs or exchanges with police forces, et cetera . It limits which countries you are talking about from which they are participating in.",376,,
1223,0.97,9430.154,9447.404,Councilmember Strauss's amendment doesn't change whether or not the Seattle police Department can participate in Trainings with military forces or with police forces within the United States.,376,,
1224,0.97,9447.404,9456.346,"With your example, a training in Chicago where military forces from other countries are participating.",376,,
1225,0.97,9456.346,9458.682,The base bill and the amendment would prohibit that.,376,,
1226,0.97,9458.682,9473.263,What Councilmember Strauss's amendment does is removes specificity about the countries that this ban is applied to and broadens it and makes it neutral.,376,,
1227,0.97,9473.263,9481.138,It's as SPD cannot do this with any police force.,376,,
1228,0.97,9481.138,9488.212,"It clarifies that they can, however, provide executive protection if city officials are traveling to those countries.",376,,
1229,0.97,9488.212,9495.152,Please correct me if I have Mischaracterized.,376,,
1230,0.97,9495.152,9501.258,I agree with Ann.,377,,
1231,0.97,9501.258,9503.46,That sounded correct to me.,377,,
1232,0.97,9503.46,9505.262,Okay.,378,,
1233,0.97,9505.262,9508.532,Okay.,378,,
1234,0.97,9508.532,9521.778,"Councilmember Sawant, this was your line of questioning so I just want to circle back and make sure you have finished your line of questioning here so I can call on Councilmember Mosqueda next.",378,,
1235,0.97,9521.778,9522.179,Yes.,379,,
1236,0.97,9522.179,9527.885,I just want to thank Allie for that clarification.,379,,
1237,0.97,9527.885,9528.285,Great.,380,,
1238,0.97,9528.285,9531.955,"Okay, thank you so much, Councilmember Sawant.",380,,
1239,0.97,9531.955,9539.263,"Councilmember Mosqueda, your hand has been raised for a while . Thank you for your patience.",380,,
1240,0.97,9539.263,9539.663,Go ahead.,380,,
1241,0.97,9539.663,9542.165,"Thank you very much, Council president and colleagues for this dialogue.",381,,
1242,0.97,9542.165,9555.312,"I want to thank Councilmember Sawant for bringing us forward, Councilmember Herbold go all of your work, and Councilmember Strauss for this amendment in front of us and bringing us back to the answer that Allie just provided.",381,,
1243,0.97,9555.312,9573.63,"The underlying goal here as many community partners have underscored to really keep us focused on making sure that as we Re-Envision committee policing, it is done through the communities lens and we have a chance to hit a reset button and we think about what training looks like for our police personnel.",381,,
1244,0.97,9573.63,9599.156,"It doesn't and shouldn't be done only by military personnel and we are making a statement here that going forward, training will not include partnership with other military entities or other countries and their military bodies . I want to Orient us to the why we are doing this, which is to refocus us back on community orientation to what public safety should look like.",381,,
1245,0.97,9599.156,9619.876,I think this is an important piece of legislation in that longer-term goal . I think the legislation was enhanced in committee . I appreciate the clarification that has been offered by central staff here today about both the underlying bill and the amendment in front of us.,381,,
1246,0.97,9619.876,9662.519,"Councilmember Strauss, I appreciate the line you have walked here to make sure we have a full understanding of how both the police forces intelligence agencies, security forces, all of which we want to make sure are getting trained by other military personnel or with other countries and their military personnel regardless of where they are, including to our friends in the North . We want to continue to reshape our training in the future to be focused on community strategies, especially to create greater security so folks never interact with police officers to begin with . I appreciate the clarification offered on this amendment and with that, I believe there is support in the community with this.",381,,
1247,0.97,9662.519,9670.26,Thank you and I look forward to supporting this amendment as well.,381,,
1248,0.97,9672.362,9675.132,Okay.,382,,
1249,0.97,9675.132,9681.438,"Just to be clear, Councilmember Mosqueda, you are supporting Councilmember Strauss's amendment?",382,,
1250,0.97,9681.438,9685.909,The amendment--yes.,383,,
1251,0.97,9685.909,9691.815,There are a lot of amendments.,384,,
1252,0.97,9691.815,9700.057,"I am happy to support this amendment that I think has additional strength, given what central staff has set in their clarification on Councilmember Strauss's amendment.",385,,
1253,0.97,9700.057,9706.463,"Councilmember Herbold, your hand has been raised for a while.",386,,
1254,0.97,9706.463,9709.666,I don't know if that is new?,386,,
1255,0.97,9709.666,9711.668,"Thank you, Madam President.",387,,
1256,0.97,9711.668,9718.175,My colleagues will be somewhat similar to Councilmember Herbold.,387,,
1257,0.97,9718.175,9720.043,I guess you could have called on her again.,387,,
1258,0.97,9720.043,9729.386,I just want to reiterate what Councilmember Herbold said earlier.,387,,
1259,0.97,9729.386,9736.693,I appreciate what Councilmember Strauss is trying to do and I appreciate anything that makes anything more about our values as a city.,387,,
1260,0.97,9736.693,9764.121,"The issue that I have, especially as this has brought up to include any police force, there are examples of police forces in other countries that do have practices that we might want to study and emulate that might benefit from some kind of foreign exchange so they can talk about what they do.",387,,
1261,0.97,9764.121,9769.292,A good option is crowd control practices in Sweden.,387,,
1262,0.97,9769.292,9783.94,Obviously the United Kingdom historically has stood out as a place that is generally considered to have a good model of community policing by international standards.,387,,
1263,0.97,9783.94,9797.888,"Certainly our biggest training partner is Canada, as demonstrated by the historic turns taken.",387,,
1264,0.97,9797.888,9805.162,I don't know enough right here in this session about the nature of our training and exchanges with Canada.,387,,
1265,0.97,9805.162,9815.539,"Given those things, I do think at this time without knowing more information, I can't support this amendment given the Broadness.",387,,
1266,0.97,9815.539,9817.474,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",388,,
1267,0.97,9817.474,9820.177,Councilmember Sawant?,388,,
1268,0.97,9820.177,9826.082,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez.",389,,
1269,0.97,9826.082,9842.699,I want to congratulate all of the activists and community members that called in for public comment in opposition to the original version of the amendment that Councilmember Strauss had sent out at 2:01 P.M.,389,,
1270,0.97,9842.699,9851.074,"I just want to let all of the members of the public who spoke and have been paying attention to this issue, you clearly had a powerful impact.",389,,
1271,0.97,9851.074,9853.276,The 2:01 P.M.,389,,
1272,0.97,9853.276,9857.714,Version would remove restrictions of training police forces.,389,,
1273,0.97,9857.714,9861.418,At 4:17 P.M.,389,,
1274,0.97,9861.418,9863.92,", this draft has been updated to put police forces back in.",389,,
1275,0.97,9863.92,9878.902,"That does close a loophole, but I also have concerns about the whole point of this amendment.",389,,
1276,0.97,9878.902,9901.258,"At this point, the only difference is this amendment also prohibits the police Department from training with the police of countries that are not human rights Abusers in addition to those that are human rights Abusers.",389,,
1277,0.97,9901.258,9904.461,"For International human rights organizations, they define these issues.",389,,
1278,0.97,9904.461,9916.239,My intent and the intent of the deadly exchange activists with whom we have worked closely to draft legislation was to focus on human rights Abusers.,389,,
1279,0.97,9916.239,9934.09,"This amendment does not change human rights Abusers but I am concerned that if it passes, it will be used to overall undermine the law.",389,,
1280,0.97,9934.09,9948.705,"It would be a blanket law, which would not be accepted by a lot of forces in the political establishment.",389,,
1281,0.97,9948.705,9951.608,"For that reason, I will be voting no on this amendment.",389,,
1282,0.97,9951.608,9962.385,I just wanted to clarify that Councilmember Strauss said he brought this amendment because he didn't think the base bill had brought in the idea of nation mortality.,389,,
1283,0.97,9962.385,9969.759,It wasn't the context of human rights abuses not just in general.,389,,
1284,0.97,9969.759,9977.834,The objection to the very original version of the bill was it only mentioned Israel and not other countries that might have been recorded by the International human rights organizations.,389,,
1285,0.97,9977.834,9988.345,"We agreed with that and changed it a Bingley . in that sense, it is nationwide . Thank you.",389,,

1290,0.97,10000.357,10020.043,"Councilmember Lewis, to answer your question about being too expensive or restrictive as he sat on the committee, I would suggest voting yes, in favor of this amendment today and separately creating a list of countries that are allowed to train with the Seattle police Department.",393,,
1291,0.97,10020.043,10026.883,Being specific and Proactive rather than looking backwards and trying to define.,393,,
1292,0.97,10026.883,10051.708,"Councilmember Sawant, in response to your comments about the amendment, without this amendment there is a large loop hill in the bill . that loophole is being able to ascertain or understand whether or not the country in question does or does not comply with international standards amongst a number of different lists that even we, here at Council, have had a difficult time understanding today.",393,,
1293,0.97,10051.708,10073.363,"And so, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment to remove the loophole that is in the bill and make it nation neutral . any further refinements needed in the future, take that up in a Proactive way.",393,,
1294,0.97,10073.363,10075.732,"Thank you, Council President.",393,,
1295,0.97,10075.732,10076.132,Okay.,394,,

I appreciate the opportunity to have additional conversations about it and I thought it merited having a little more time than we would perhaps ordinarily have if for no other reason than the fact that we all are just learning about this proposed amendment in our last hour or so . Thanks so much for your patience . I really appreciate your openness and willingness to have that public debate . Okay, there are no additional comments on this amendment.",394,,

1364,0.97,10333.69,10345.468,This will add a reference to the statute which was left out of the amendment that the public safety Committee approved last Tuesday.,441,,

1366,0.97,10370.626,10389.779,"Since the exclusion in subsection B relies on the criminal court as the body determining the violation, it is only logical to site the statute along with the other treaties, so that is simply what this amendment does.",441,,

1372,0.97,10414.537,10463.886,"So important objective satisfied with the criteria on the committee was easily verified criteria that are based in the for grounding of human rights and easy for staff to apply . as it relates to the ICC PR, there are lists associated with those treaties that establish those countries that are not signatories to the treaties . as it relates to the Rome statute that is in the inverse, whereas the list that exists our indicators of nations that are inventory to the treaty.",443,,
1373,0.97,10463.886,10475.631,"I also have some confusion about what is a Signatory, what is a party to, what is ratifying, what does it mean to not sign?",443,,
1374,0.97,10475.631,10507.563,There is a lot of confusion . I am really sorry . I am not comfortable supporting this right now . currently available data suggests this amendment would expand the exclusion criteria to an additional 48 countries beyond the approximately 35 countries that would be excluded by the criteria in the base bill . that is about 45% of the world's nations.,443,,
1375,0.97,10507.563,10557.113,"I am very uncomfortable with, again, broadening the scope of the exclusions beyond the exclusions that I moved in my amendment, the amendment that is being proposed--the language is what I offered last week specifically with the intent of making sure that the exclusion criteria is a verifiable and simply implemented by the Seattle police Department . I don't want the Seattle police Department to have to do Google searches to figure this out.",443,,
1376,0.97,10557.113,10581.904,"Again, I am uncomfortable with this expansion and I feel really strongly that we are making the perfect enemy of the good here and we have legislation that it accomplishes the goals of the bill sponsor as well as community members who had been working to support the efforts.",443,,

1385,0.97,10630.653,10661.317,"I don't understand why the police should not be doing a search . It is a verifiable kind of data, not some random Google search . I will also add this is an amendment that has been advocated for strongly by community activists who first proposed the legislation . It is Referenced in the following paragraph.",445,,
1386,0.97,10661.317,10671.027,These are technical clarity and consistency that only stands to include the statute because it had already been referred to.,445,,

I have tried to be really clear that my support for this comes from a place of really deep commitment to human rights as well as a firm belief that we as a city should not spending public dollars to send police abroad for the purpose of training with countries that are violating human rights . I also firmly believe that we should be moving our police Department away from Militarization and really as Councilmember Mosqueda was mentioning earlier today, really moving away from the Militarization and towards more Community-Based organizations and toward a different way of policing.",467,,
1425,0.97,10906.662,10919.842,That requires that we invest in he Department in a different kind of way as well . I don't think they should be training with Militaries or security services in countries engaging in human rights.,467,,
1426,0.97,10919.842,10926.181,I do want to express my interest in Cosponsoring the legislation.,467,,
1427,0.97,10926.181,10936.558,"The last thing I want to say is that to those that condemn this bill as Anti-Somatic, I don't believe this is about the Jewish people at all.",467,,
1428,0.97,10936.558,10939.795,It's not about the Jewish religion.,467,,
1429,0.97,10939.795,10961.116,"This is about the policies and practices of jurisdictions and States and governments and as a municipal official, I don't think we should be spending resources to send our police Department to other States and other countries for the purpose of any sort of training.",467,,
1430,0.97,10961.116,10976.732,I look forward to supporting this bill and I want to thank Councilmember Sawant for sponsoring it and the activists and advocates that have been working with her office and with I think all of our offices to garner support for the legislation.,467,,
1431,0.97,10976.732,10977.599,Thank you.,467,,
1432,0.97,10977.599,10980.235,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",468,,
1433,0.97,10980.235,10985.708,Councilmember Mosqueda and after Councilmember Mosqueda will be Councilmember Pedersen.,468,,
1434,0.97,10985.708,11001.557,"Thank you very much, Council President dear colleagues, I want to thank you all for all of your work to get us to this day and to the community partners and folks I have met with with on all sides of the issue as well.",469,,
1435,0.97,11001.557,11005.828,I want to say thank you to Jewish voice for peace.,469,,
1436,0.97,11005.828,11021.477,I will continue to work with folks who we might not agree on this piece of legislation to find pathways forward for greater support for humanitarian rights locally and across the world.,469,,
1437,0.97,11021.477,11038.894,"This is an important piece of legislation and I want to thank Councilmember Sawant for bringing it forward and Councilmember Herbold for your work . again, I think it is important to lift up that amendment that you made for a committee that I know had quite a bit of support to get this bill across the finish line here today.",469,,
1438,0.97,11038.894,11044.199,"Councilmember Strauss, thank you for the legislation that you were aiming to amend today.",469,,
1439,0.97,11044.199,11045.734,I am happy to have supported that.,469,,
1440,0.97,11045.734,11052.808,"Councilmember Sawant's amendment number three that included the statute, I did support that and I do support it.",469,,
1441,0.97,11052.808,11063.685,I think it'll be helpful for Asp as a body and as a community to look at this quite literally which led to the creation of the International criminal court.,469,,
1442,0.97,11063.685,11073.061,I think it would have been an addition to this legislation that would have allowed for us to have Trainings with other countries.,469,,
1443,0.97,11073.061,11080.936,"Over 100 additional countries including countries we look to as the models, including Sweden, Canada, and some may include Britain as well.",469,,
1444,0.97,11080.936,11095.851,I know there will be ongoing work as we try to continue to make sure this legislation is adhered to and I will do additional research on the world statute to see if we can further strengthen in the future.,469,,
1445,0.97,11095.851,11113.869,"This is a piece of legislation that I think is a really important component to our ongoing work to redefine what community safety looks like and the different types of Trainings we want our officers to receive, Trainings rooted in community alternatives and traditional responses.",469,,
1446,0.97,11113.869,11150.172,"Trainings that are not led by military entities and Trainings that no matter the country are in line with our values of really wanting to have strategies and making sure we are not pulling in Militaristic styles of engagement, nor Militarizing personnel . I do appreciate all of the work that has undertaken to move this legislation in front of us today and I thank the organizers, the community, and the Councilmembers I noted for all of the work they put into making this legislation possible for us to vote on today.",469,,
1447,0.97,11150.172,11153.775,I look forward to supporting this bill in the current version.,469,,
1448,0.97,11153.775,11162.217,"Thank you very much, Councilmembers, for your engagement as we continue looking at various strategies to have public safety really rooted in community.",469,,
1449,0.97,11162.217,11163.018,Thank you so much.,469,,
1450,0.97,11163.018,11165.02,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Mosqueda.",470,,
1451,0.97,11165.02,11173.195,"Next up, Councilmember Pedersen and after Councilmember Pedersen will be Councilmember Lewis and then Councilmember Herbold.",470,,
1452,0.97,11173.195,11174.329,"Thank you, Council President.",471,,
1453,0.97,11174.329,11177.833,Thank you for the guidance with the various amendments.,471,,
1454,0.97,11177.833,11188.043,"While we actually share common ground to Demilitarized our police force, I believe this legislation has been not only distracting but also divisive.",471,,
1455,0.97,11188.043,11202.691,"We have heard from the Anti- defamation League, the Jewish Federation of Seattle and others that are concerned about the origin, intent, and impact of this legislation from a policy standpoint.",471,,
1456,0.97,11202.691,11209.231,I believe the legislation seems to be a solution in search of a problem.,471,,
1457,0.97,11209.231,11216.071,Legislation has definitely been a time-consuming issue.,471,,
1458,0.97,11216.071,11243.699,"Countless hours have been spent trying to analyze which nations are or are not included in the legislation and it appears this was not appropriately consulted by the original sponsor of the bill . rather than veering into international law and international relations, we have ways to deepen reform and safety and that includes revamping the police Union contract which expired eight months ago.",471,,
1459,0.97,11243.699,11246.068,I will be voting no on this final bill.,471,,
1460,0.97,11246.068,11249.171,Thank you.,471,,
1461,0.97,11249.171,11259.314,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen . next up, Councilmember Lewis and after Councilmember Lewis will be Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Juarez.",472,,
1462,0.97,11259.314,11262.184,"Thank you, Madam President.",473,,
1463,0.97,11262.184,11279.601,I will also be voting against this ordinance today and I want to say that I have appreciated the access that the advocates of this ordinance have maintained from my office here at my office with an open mind.,473,,
1464,0.97,11279.601,11298.72,"To me, getting the information back from central staff and particularly this Email we received from Ann Gorman detailing the training that is occurring internationally, at least over the last decade to illustrate the bottom line of what we are even talking about.",473,,
1465,0.97,11298.72,11324.98,"You know, this does not go into what exactly these foreign trips and hailed, just numbers that the foreign trips occurred . I don't know the nature or quality or substance of the Trainings that have occurred that were essentially banned.",473,,
1466,0.97,11324.98,11349.504,There were assumptions made by members of the public and other Stakeholders attributing perhaps that we were learning poor crowd control techniques that have led to the recent extreme and unforgivable abuses that we have seen in recent months in regards to the demonstrations last summer.,473,,
1467,0.97,11349.504,11362.918,"I have not actually seen anything indicated anywhere that there is any relationship between these trips . In any event, we have quantitative Coram and information about the trips that have occurred.",473,,
1468,0.97,11362.918,11371.393,"From 2013 to 2021, SPD apparently took six trips to Israel.",473,,
1469,0.97,11371.393,11377.532,Four of those trips were for tactical training.,473,,
1470,0.97,11377.532,11388.71,"They occurred in 2013 and 2014, so there has been no training trip to Israel that his occurred in the past seven years.",473,,
1471,0.97,11388.71,11391.947,"Again, we don't have the particular nature of those Trainings except they were tactical in nature.",473,,
1472,0.97,11391.947,11402.124,I'm not really sure what they were or what bearing they have on the current Department.,473,,
1473,0.97,11402.124,11410.665,There were two additional trips to Israel but they were for executive protection.,473,,
1474,0.97,11410.665,11415.47,This would fall outside of the scope of this ordinance and would not be banned by this ordinance.,473,,
1475,0.97,11415.47,11426.381,"There has not been foreign travel, like I said, to Israel of any kind in the last seven years.",473,,
1476,0.97,11426.381,11455.51,"It is notable that the 2016 trip that chief best took that has been discussed extensively by advocates of the ordinance was not cited by the Department as a trip that would be Preempted by this ordinance, presumably there is some loophole we are not aware of or for some reason that falls outside of the scope of what the Department considers a training trip.",473,,
1477,0.97,11455.51,11466.421,That was a trip that was sponsored by the Anti- defamation League that chief best took in 2016.,473,,
1478,0.97,11466.421,11477.499,It involved visits with Israeli and Palestinian officials in various capacities with the military and police.,473,,
1479,0.97,11477.499,11485.006,That was not cited in the report that Ann gave . I'm not really sure why that is.,473,,
1480,0.97,11485.006,11499.421,"Given that scant record of Trainings with Israel, and I'm not aware in the last 10 years of any international Trainings aside from Canada, which involved 48 trips of various types, by far our largest training partner.",473,,
1481,0.97,11499.421,11522.177,"Given the amendments that have passed and were considered those trips were not manned by the ordinance, it seems that there is no ongoing or frankly concerning practice that this ordinance would prevent or stop . I am not aware of any pending or planned Trainings, but the Department will undertaken Israel.",473,,
1482,0.97,11522.177,11527.249,It has been seven years and it does not seem that is an ongoing exchange that the city has.,473,,
1483,0.97,11527.249,11534.689,Were there briefings or detailed information about why they are concerning?,473,,
1484,0.97,11534.689,11538.393,What is the Seattle police Department learning in Israel?,473,,
1485,0.97,11538.393,11544.499,That might change my analysis.,473,,
1486,0.97,11544.499,11548.603,"From what I am seeing here, it's been seven years and we don't know the Trainings that occurred before them.",473,,
1487,0.97,11548.603,11554.876,That seems to be the bottom line.,473,,
1488,0.97,11554.876,11557.646,"Given that, I don't think I need to go into any more detail.",473,,
1489,0.97,11557.646,11563.618,Those are my primary concerns.,473,,
1490,0.97,11563.618,11566.087,"For that purpose, I will not be voting for this ordinance today.",473,,
1491,0.97,11566.087,11567.756,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",474,,
1492,0.97,11567.756,11572.127,I appreciate you walking us through that rationale.,474,,
1493,0.97,11572.127,11575.03,"Next up, Councilmember Herbold and after Councilmember Herbold will be Councilmember Juarez.",474,,
1494,0.97,11575.03,11576.197,Thank you.,475,,
1495,0.97,11576.197,11597.786,"Just very briefly as background when this bill was first brought to my attention, I did tell advocates I would only allow a bill to be heard in a public safety and human services committee if it were a nation neutral focus on human rights standards as applied to all countries.",475,,
1496,0.97,11597.786,11626.481,I would not permit a bill on my committee agenda that singled out Israel because of concerns that I have heard from members of our community that told me they were worried that legislation specific to Israel would inflame hate crimes against the Jewish people already on the rise . My support for this bill is very simply based in Seattle Council's statements in resolution 31858 and 31958 and centered in the first recital in the bill that Seattle is a human rights city.,475,,
1497,0.97,11626.481,11627.983,Thank you.,475,,
1498,0.97,11627.983,11633.288,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",476,,
1499,0.97,11633.288,11633.755,Councilmember Juarez?,476,,
1500,0.97,11633.755,11634.889,"Thank you, Council President.",477,,
1501,0.97,11634.889,11636.558,"Thank you, everybody, for all of your work.",477,,
1502,0.97,11636.558,11642.197,I will be voting no today as well for some of the reasons my colleagues have already shared.,477,,
1503,0.97,11642.197,11646.901,"In general, let me just share a little bit of what my analysis is and what my thoughts are.",477,,
1504,0.97,11646.901,11651.773,"I don't think this is the right arena, if you will.",477,,
1505,0.97,11651.773,11670.992,"I think today's discussion started at 4:15 underscores the discussion, the confusion, and the disagreement . We are not an international tribe . It is not our job to go through the International civil and political rights or the Covenant on social and cultural rights.",477,,
1506,0.97,11670.992,11679.601,We are not the U.N. I will not go back and read the fourth Geneva convention and what happened in Switzerland.,477,,
1507,0.97,11679.601,11685.306,"We are not the International terminal court or the Rome statute, which I am familiar with.",477,,
1508,0.97,11685.306,11689.344,I do agree with what Councilmember Mosqueda said.,477,,
1509,0.97,11689.344,11707.829,"That was always my intent . If it was on our values for human rights in that we get away from the Militarization of our police force but based on what Councilmember Lewis said as well, we have scant facts, quite frankly.",477,,
1510,0.97,11707.829,11716.438,We actually need to pass an ordinance because what I think we are doing is we are punishing Israel.,477,,
1511,0.97,11716.438,11719.974,I think this creates division.,477,,
1512,0.97,11719.974,11723.511,I think we are not being intellectually honest about what is actually going on here.,477,,
1513,0.97,11723.511,11731.753,"Obviously this is a bigger picture of human rights . These issues, these human rights issues have been going on for decades.",477,,
1514,0.97,11731.753,11739.094,We have spent an amount of time on this when we have 16 items on today's agenda.,477,,
1515,0.97,11739.094,11740.295,Let me share this with you.,477,,
1516,0.97,11740.295,11761.282,"I have received three phone calls from three national organizations, Jewish organizations, that wanted me to know--and I also looked it up, that the recent FBI hate crime Statistics study for 2020 of the 57% Religious-Based hate crimes were all focused on Jewish people.",477,,
1517,0.97,11761.282,11778.733,"That to me is alarming when Jewish people make up 2% of the population . again, I don't want to go into this about going down this rabbit hole of international law . I think what we are really saying here is we are weapon I think our vote.",477,,
1518,0.97,11778.733,11791.312,"One thing that has always disturbed me, and most of the time I am quiet about it, but sometimes we go and Webinars our votes to hurt, punish, retaliate, Humiliate.",477,,
1519,0.97,11791.312,11793.948,I think that is what we are doing today.,477,,
1520,0.97,11793.948,11802.056,I don't think it is to educate or lead us into a better place or in the right direction.,477,,
1521,0.97,11802.056,11804.058,I understand the principles of human rights.,477,,
1522,0.97,11804.058,11839.494,"I understand why we want to have those values spoken to and addressed . A little-known fact about Deborah Juarez, I did study international law in France and Switzerland . I know a little bit about some of this . again, this isn't people are against all of these principles and values that we want to uphold as a city, but this shines more . It doesn't shine more light on the issue, but it creates heat and those of you that are familiar when something creates more heat than light, then there is a problem there.",477,,
1523,0.97,11839.494,11841.996,We don't need a lot.,477,,
1524,0.97,11841.996,11857.111,"This is--you can hide behind it all you want but the reason we had to change it, and I made a mistake and I wanted to make this country neutral, as Councilmember Pedersen was saying.",477,,
1525,0.97,11857.111,11859.113,"Sorry, Councilmember--Yeah.",477,,
1526,0.97,11859.113,11862.817,Councilmember Lewis was saying.,477,,
1527,0.97,11862.817,11869.724,I just think it is dishonest to put something forward when I know what we are really trying to do.,477,,
1528,0.97,11869.724,11875.63,I would rather we get right to the facts and be honest about it and have that discussion and I want to end on this note.,477,,
1529,0.97,11875.63,11883.938,I am not saying that what Councilmember Sawant is doing is a bad thing . I am saying we need to be honest about what we are really talking about.,477,,
1530,0.97,11883.938,11899.554,"I think that--and thank you, Council President, for walking us through all of this, but again I think it underscores the purpose and it does create division . I believe as leaders, we have to do more than that.",477,,
1531,0.97,11899.554,11899.954,Thank you.,477,,
1532,0.97,11899.954,11901.623,I will be voting no.,477,,
1533,0.97,11901.623,11907.462,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez for walking us through your rationale.",478,,
1534,0.97,11907.462,11937.292,"You know, I also really wanted to, you know, sort of emphasize my agreement with many of the comments expressed by Councilmember Juarez and Lewis in particular . Councilmember Lewis is one of two Councilmembers during the meeting that Abstained in hopes of being able to do some sort of curing of some of the issues that we discussed in committee and Unfortunately, I don't feel that has occurred.",478,,
1535,0.97,11937.292,11955.376,"Councilmember Juarez, you know, I really am committed to addressing the reality is of not wanting to be part of a city that is actively participating in practices in which other nations are supporting and advancing human rights violations.",478,,
1536,0.97,11955.376,11967.221,I just don't have a sense of confidence that the formula as described in this bill is actually going to have the intended effect.,478,,
1537,0.97,11967.221,11978.833,I also worry that the intent is actually about the ongoing dispute in the Middle East.,478,,
1538,0.97,11978.833,12032.787,"I have become very concerned about the impacts of our local actions in that space that could ultimately result in some harm, whether we intend it to or not . like many of you, I have engaged with many people in the community on this and have heard, you know, a lot of differing opinions but I think the overwhelming number of folks I have spoken to have pleaded with us to find a different way to accomplish the underlying goals of Militarizing our police Department, of remaining a human rights city, and I think there are ways for us to accomplish that that would be both meaningful and productive.",478,,
1539,0.97,12032.787,12040.294,And not divisive to use Councilmember Juarez's words.,478,,
1540,0.97,12040.294,12052.74,"With that, I will head over to Councilmember Strauss . I am so sorry for that . For disclosure, I had to switch to my phone because my Internet has been so unstable.",478,,
1541,0.97,12052.74,12061.682,"I apologize I skipped you in seeing the hand feature . go ahead, Councilmember Strauss.",478,,
1542,0.97,12061.682,12066.754,"Thank you, Council President.",479,,
1543,0.97,12066.754,12082.203,"Colleagues, when I met with the Jewish Federation and Jewish voice for peace in the same week, I told them both I would be putting forward a nation neutral amendment and if it was truly expensive to all nations, I would vote in favor of this ordinance.",479,,
1544,0.97,12082.203,12093.347,"I told Councilmember Herbold as chair of the committee, I told you this about the same Timeline at least over a month ago . I have been consistent with my position that that is where we needed to be.",479,,
1545,0.97,12093.347,12103.091,It is not your fault or my fault that I was not consulted last week in preparation for this bill to come out of committee.,479,,
1546,0.97,12103.091,12126.08,"It is important for me to make it nation neutral by not attempting to understand international law, to not create loopholes for countries to slide through . It is important for me to also put on the record that it is important to be said another way.",479,,
