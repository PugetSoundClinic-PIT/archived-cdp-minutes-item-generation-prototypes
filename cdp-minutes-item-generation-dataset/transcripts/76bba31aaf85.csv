40,0.97,278.044,289.389,"He is eager, quick to learn, a strong collaborator, brings a wealth of experience, focused on equity, safety, and Sustainability.",11,,
41,0.97,289.455,301.167,Further the Mayor's strong support for Greg is rooted in his ability to look at the Sdot framework strategies as it relates to the future transportation funding package.,11,,

50,0.97,357.79,361.594,Tomorrow will be my first day on the job as interim director.,12,,
51,0.97,361.661,370.837,Hopefully tomorrow morning I will begin the day walking children to school with Mayor Harrell in West Seattle.,12,,
52,0.97,370.903,383.983,"I have had One-On-One or have One-On-One introductory meetings Scheduledwith Councilmembers over the next ten days, and I'm looking forward to get to learn each of you and learn your priorities.",12,,
53,0.97,384.05,392.658,I have done my best to answer your written questions thoroughly and look forward to discussing the topics with you today.,12,,
54,0.97,392.725,408.474,"Please NOTE they have not yet started work at Sdot, and my responses are based on public information and represent my opinion as a candidate for the position.",12,,
55,0.97,408.541,424.59,"I will ask two of the Council's written questions for the benefit of the viewing public and one additional question as well, and then I will turn it over to my colleagues if they want to raise up any of the questions asked or ask new questions.",13,,
56,0.97,424.657,426.225,The first two you answered.,13,,
57,0.97,426.292,458.591,"One about pedestrian safety, vision zero, and the other about bridges, and then I will have a third question here, but I wanted you to tell the viewing audience a little bit about your answer on pedestrian safety, and the question we asked was, to summarize here, following Seattle seeing a high number of collisions this year, how will you advance the vision zero goal for zero fatalities by 2030.",13,,
58,0.97,458.658,459.625,"Again, it's Online, Mr.",13,,
59,0.97,458.658,467.2,"Spott's answer for that, but we will hear that this morning because I know it's important to everybody in the city.",13,,
60,0.97,467.266,484.283,"Regarding bridges, the question we asked in summary, Seattle is a city connected by bridges, and the city has suffered from the Seattle of the West bridge over the last two years, how will you apply for your experience of building or upgrading bridges in Los Angeles, California.",13,,
61,0.97,484.35,504.47,"The new question today, in preparation for today's vote, my office reached out to the Los Angeles city Council to hear from a few of your former legislative colleagues there, and we heard a lot of positive remarks about your creative problem solving and that you work well with the Mayor and Council in Los Angeles.",13,,
62,0.97,504.537,511.944,One item that was consistently mentioned is the differing governing structure the two cities have for transportation.,13,,
63,0.97,512.011,546.078,"As I understand it the city of Los Angeles handles transportation planning under the Department of transportation whereas the city handles the implementation such as maintenance and operations within the Bureau of Street services under the board of public works where you worked, so Seattle's Department of transportation, of course, handles both the Pollty is implementation, so tell us more about your experience involved in the policy and planning aspects that will enable you to be successful in the Seattle Department of transportation.",13,,
64,0.97,546.145,555.821,"So if you could address those three things, pedestrian safety, bridges, and then the differing governing structures in L.A.",13,,
65,0.97,555.888,556.188,Very good.,14,,
66,0.97,556.255,563.062,"Thank you so much chair Pedersen, and thank you for your support during the process as well.",14,,
67,0.97,563.129,610.476,"There's many different, you know, stake holders and projects and programs that Sdot encompasses, but you know, in this period of between, you know, interviewing with the Mayor or July 1ST and now, two issues have risen to the hospital as far as what I have been hearing from Stakeholders inside and outside of government, figuring out how to make progress on reducing Traffic-Related injuries and deaths, particularly for pedestrians, and strengthening the asset management program for the extensive network of bridges that are maintained by Sdot.",14,,
68,0.97,610.543,624.69,"Regarding vision zero, when the Mayor of Los Angeles launched the vision zero program in 2015, a steering committee was part of the executive directive, and I raised my hand to be streets L.A.",14,,
69,0.97,624.757,626.692,Representative on the committee.,14,,
70,0.97,626.759,633.299,I helped to develop the vision zero program in Los Angeles.,14,,
71,0.97,633.366,671.704,"It's true that nationally there's a significant increase in Traffic-Related deaths and serious injuries, and one of the theories is that in the pandemic there's been actually less vehicles on the road and therefore higher vehicle speeds, and therefore more risk from collisions, and I really do feel that it's urgently needed to do a top to bottom review of the vision zero in Seattle, looking carefully at the data to try to really bring forth the insights among the many interventions that have been implemented, which ones are saving lives?",14,,
72,0.97,671.771,672.638,Which ones aren't.,14,,
73,0.97,672.705,683.449,In what situations and what keeps of configurations are they working or not working?,14,,
74,0.97,683.516,691.19,"And also, really, just engaging deeply with the Stakeholders historically in Underserved communities.",14,,
75,0.97,691.257,703.436,"We know we have corridors that are very Vehicular-Oriented, north-south corridors in Seattle where there's a concentration of pedestrian injuries and deaths that will be an early priority of mine.",14,,
76,0.97,703.502,707.706,I want to mobilize every one of the thousand people who work at Sdot.,14,,
77,0.97,707.773,711.277,"What we do in the morning, we start with safety.",14,,
78,0.97,711.343,714.78,There's no job at Sdot that is not concerned with safety.,14,,
79,0.97,714.847,723.789,"So I want to really make that there is not just the core vision zero team, but the entire Department is the vision zero team.",14,,
80,0.97,723.856,730.529,I look forward to jumping into that right away.,14,,
81,0.97,730.596,738.337,"I really appreciate chair Pedersen, your bringing me out to visit the University bridge and Spotlighting the issue pertaining to the bridges.",14,,
82,0.97,738.404,750.082,"I reviewed the audit in detail, and actually I consulted with some subject matter experiences on construction and maintenance including one of my colleagues in L.A.",14,,
83,0.97,750.149,754.72,Who used to run the bridge program for Los Angeles.,14,,
84,0.97,754.787,759.258,I'm very supportive of the recommendations in that audit.,14,,
85,0.97,759.325,763.429,I think there's more to be done beyond the recommendations.,14,,
86,0.97,763.496,771.27,I would like to accelerate the recommendations of what is being require in the recommendations.,14,,
87,0.97,771.337,795.161,"Really making sure Sdot has the people, systems, and technology that is needed to bring the contemporary Asset-Managed approach to manage the bridges as a portfolio to try to prevent like what happened in West Seattle where an asset is suddenly taken out of service.",14,,
88,0.97,795.227,824.29,"I'm willing to involve outside subject matter experts if I find it's needed in order to build the strong systems for that absolutely critical function, and yesterday in my sort of epic walk and bike and bus riding around the city on my first day, I got to cross two of the bridges on foot, and it was sobering thinking that I'm going to be in charge of those essential assets.",14,,
89,0.97,824.356,842.608,"Regarding the transportation policy making in Los Angeles, one of the things that attracted me to this role in Seattle is that pretty much all of the functions pertaining to what is aboveground street level is contained within Sdot.",14,,
90,0.97,842.675,847.079,It's very challenging in L.A.,14,,
91,0.97,847.146,853.219,To do Holistic Multibenefit Street design because of how Siloed and separated the functions are.,14,,
92,0.97,853.285,855.287,The Department of public works has five bureaus.,14,,
93,0.97,855.354,873.339,"I've been number two at one of the bureaus, and we design, build, and maintain the infrastructure, and Ladot uses the markings and signs.",14,,
94,0.97,873.405,883.182,Most of the policies are made with interdepartmental groups there was a complete streets committee.,14,,
95,0.97,883.249,887.019,I was one of several streets L.A.,14,,
96,0.97,887.086,888.821,Members on the committee.,14,,
97,0.97,888.887,898.264,"There's a sidewalk repair Committee, and I have been the longest standing person, and we--the city of L.A.",14,,
98,0.97,898.33,911.977,"Got sued over the sidewalk conditions pertaining to Ada, and there's a real eight-year policy development and implementation policy.",14,,
99,0.97,912.044,916.715,I have been there from the beginning until now on the policy area.,14,,
100,0.97,916.782,931.597,I have Pollty making and implementation experience in L.A.,14,,
101,0.97,931.664,932.431,Through the interdepartmental policy.,14,,
102,0.97,932.498,937.836,I was honored to be the sponsor of the policy to Legalize sidewalk vending.,14,,
103,0.97,937.903,963.329,"There's a rich Street food scene that was illegal for the entire 20th century, and it felt like something that was almost impossible to unlock, many, many of us working on it, but I was proud to be the executive sponsor of the lead Department of the effort to Legalize sidewalk vending to support mostly people of color, and that was something I'm very proud of.",14,,
104,0.97,963.395,965.664,Also the urban forestry division of streets L.A.,14,,
105,0.97,965.731,986.051,"Reported up to me for the last seven years, and I have brought forth many policies in collaboration with Council and the board of public works to strengthen the protection of healthy, mature trees, street trees, and in L.A., six specious of native trees protected on private property.",14,,
106,0.97,986.118,993.325,I have collaborated with Council and the board on many of the policy initiatives.,14,,
107,0.97,993.392,1005.971,"I do feel quite comfortable in the policy space, and I'm very excited to have all of the functions under one roof where we can really take the Holistic look at the different benefits we can have from the infrastructure.",14,,
108,0.97,1006.038,1017.383,"Thank you very thoughtful and thorough answers on the safety for everybody, and on the infrastructure, and on policymaking for transportation.",15,,
109,0.97,1017.449,1034.666,"I do want to just remind the public that they can go on the city council's Website, and they can see the 30 plus questions we asked and all of his responses, and we really appreciate Theanswers to those questions.",15,,
110,0.97,1034.733,1040.773,I will turn it over to my colleagues to make comments and ask questions.,15,,
111,0.97,1040.839,1044.51,"I see Herbold's hand and Morales is eager, too.",15,,
112,0.97,1044.576,1048.313,"Morales first, and then to Councilmember Herbold.",15,,
113,0.97,1048.38,1049.815,"Great, thank you.",16,,
114,0.97,1049.882,1055.754,I have three areas that seem to align with the things you're focusing on anyway which is great.,16,,
115,0.97,1055.821,1058.123,"First of all, thank you for being here.",16,,
116,0.97,1058.19,1058.457,Good morning.,16,,
117,0.97,1058.524,1058.924,Welcome to Seattle.,16,,
118,0.97,1058.991,1068.1,"I did see your thread yesterday, and it looks like you got at least your 10,000 steps in.",16,,
119,0.97,1068.167,1075.808,"So I represent the South end, District two where last year 56% of the fatalities on Seattle streets happened in my district.",16,,
120,0.97,1075.874,1086.885,"So it's really important to me that the next director have a deep commitment to vision zero, and I appreciate the answer you just gave to Councilmember Pedersen.",16,,
121,0.97,1086.952,1092.057,You mentioned in your written responses that Rainier Avenue is hostile to pedestrians.,16,,
122,0.97,1092.124,1092.691,I would agree.,16,,
123,0.97,1092.758,1104.369,I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about what makes it hostile and what you think we can do to change that and other streets in the same situation.,16,,
124,0.97,1104.436,1111.41,"Sure, I mean, I would definitely want to spend more time out on Rainier and with you and the community members.",17,,
125,0.97,1111.477,1118.684,"That's the whole function of the listening tour, and I did do some walking.",17,,
126,0.97,1118.75,1141.874,"You know, there are places, you know, where there's a very wide crossing distance to get across, and there's places where there are freeway Onramps and Offramps Unsignallized, which is a very scary thing to try to cross when people are driving to get on or off.",17,,
127,0.97,1141.94,1174.339,"Missing curb ramps, and we have Arterials like this in Los Angeles as well, and particularly in the San Fernando Valley we built very, very wide Arterials with the idea of moving the maximum amount of traffic, and the thinking today, the streets need to work for the people who are there, not just the people who are passing through there, and at its worst, some of the corridors like Aurora and Rainier, they feel like they are really oriented to people who are just passing through.",17,,
128,0.97,1174.406,1179.478,To the extent where you can be asking heroic measures by pedestrians and cyclists just to get around.,17,,
129,0.97,1179.545,1185.517,I think we have to change that.,17,,
130,0.97,1185.584,1211.71,"We have to make it so that the community has a strong voice so it works for people who live there, and I listened to one, and I have been Emmersing myself in like the Seattle Podcast scene, and I listened to one program where a woman said it's like impossible to walk to her small business down there, and it's only like half a mile away from where she lives, and that is not fair.",17,,
131,0.97,1211.777,1212.878,That is something we have to fix.,17,,
132,0.97,1212.945,1220.118,I want to spend time out there with you and the constituents and surface the interventions they are asking for to make a difference.,17,,
133,0.97,1220.185,1220.786,I appreciate that.,18,,
134,0.97,1220.852,1226.825,"That is one of the things we are trying to figure out, right?",18,,
135,0.97,1226.892,1239.771,"How do we Prioritize safety, and what does it mean for improving neighborhood accessibility, so people can get to the goods and services they need without having to get in a car or worrying about being hit by a car.",18,,
136,0.97,1239.838,1244.509,So I would just say we have been on Recess for two weeks at City Council.,18,,
137,0.97,1244.576,1254.453,"Apparently my staff has been using that time to make a Video about sort of the history of Seattle's streets and what it means, so I would encourage you to find it on Youtube.",18,,
138,0.97,1254.519,1262.06,It's called what it's like living low vision and Carless in Seattle.,18,,
139,0.97,1262.127,1271.103,"It really does illustrate for people how hard it is to get around and how it is not a choice for some people, and we need to address that.",18,,
140,0.97,1271.169,1276.742,So two other issues I want to cover.,18,,
141,0.97,1276.808,1278.543,Seattle is experiencing more appreciate heat events.,18,,
142,0.97,1278.61,1280.278,I think we hit 110 this summer.,18,,
143,0.97,1280.345,1312.711,"Last summer we had a lot of people who lost their lives due to the heat Dome we experienced, and South Seattle has fewer parks, fewer trees, more pavement, and this means some of the neighborhoods are up to 14 degrees hotter than, you know, the northern parts of the city where there's more green and more abundance, and it also means we experience more health impacts for folks who are living in the South end.",18,,
144,0.97,1312.778,1326.692,"We included this question in our questions to you, but you know, the Bureau of transportation Statistics reports 72% of trips in the U.S. are for running Errands or recreation.",18,,
145,0.97,1326.758,1329.227,"So that means, you know, what does it mean, then?",18,,
146,0.97,1329.294,1333.432,People are really just trying to get around their neighborhoods.,18,,
147,0.97,1333.498,1352.684,"Can you paint a picture for us what it means to Decarbonize transportation in a neighborhood and what it means for people to get around more safely and in a healthier, greener way?",18,,
148,0.97,1352.751,1353.151,"Absolutely, yes.",19,,
149,0.97,1353.218,1363.662,"You know, urban heat and its nexus with mobility is a specialty of mine from my experience in Los Angeles, and I'm a nationally known Speaker on the topic.",19,,
150,0.97,1363.729,1372.37,I have actually spoken about that on Webinars with at least five Federal agencies in the last few years.,19,,
151,0.97,1372.437,1396.895,"You know, when you look at historically Red-Lined neighborhoods, they are still tree poor today and have infrastructure more oriented to Hardscape and cars than the Leafier areas of the city, and you know an experience I had five years ago informed my thinking of this.",19,,
152,0.97,1396.962,1403.769,There was a new grant available for Virginia for resilience planning at the neighborhood level.,19,,
153,0.97,1403.835,1406.772,"We applied for the $200,000 grant.",19,,
154,0.97,1406.838,1413.912,I personally selected the location for one of the hottest neighborhoods in the city in the West San Fernando valley.,19,,
155,0.97,1413.979,1431.296,I pulled the Statistics and we had a transit note that the Sherman way station that a lot of people around the transit night are Car-Light or Car-Free households.,19,,
156,0.97,1431.363,1436.134,We used the money to do a Year- long bilingual deep community outreach process.,19,,
157,0.97,1436.201,1440.939,"Every time we said urban heat and cooling, the community came back with mobility.",19,,
158,0.97,1441.006,1445.844,Like I can't get to the excellent Express bus service because it's Unshaded.,19,,
159,0.97,1445.911,1446.278,It's too hot.,19,,
160,0.97,1446.344,1459.658,I can't bike there or walk there or get to my neighborhood serving Retails in those three or four month as year where there may be 50 day as year of 95 degrees or more in this neighborhood.,19,,
161,0.97,1459.724,1471.403,"You know, the consultant that we hired worked with the community to come up with the Fly-Through videos of what they wanted.",19,,
162,0.97,1471.469,1490.222,"They wanted sort of multiple lines of trees separating the walking path, Biking path, Roundabouts, and we submitted it for the program, and we got the largest grant ever given by the program, $30 million grant to implement.",19,,
163,0.97,1490.288,1492.757,This was just last year.,19,,
164,0.97,1492.824,1511.142,"It was a great honor that the California transportation Commission wrote that future grant applicants should read our application because of the way it brought the multiple disciplines together, thinking about climate resilience and mobility together.",19,,
165,0.97,1511.209,1514.412,So I am really excited to bring that kind of thinking to Seattle.,19,,
166,0.97,1514.479,1528.66,"It was resident for me that the week I came up here for the press conference to be announced as the Mayor's nominee, it was the first time ever that there's been five consecutive days of 90-degree heat in Seattle.",19,,
167,0.97,1528.727,1535.433,It seems to be a good time to be showing up with that expertise.,19,,

174,0.97,1571.236,1577.943,"We, in 2007 or 2008, I believe it was passed the complete Streeted ordinance.",21,,
175,0.97,1578.009,1582.714,In 2018 we changed it to a streets illustrated model.,21,,
176,0.97,1582.781,1598.697,"We are really seen as the leaders in passing, drafting, designing great efforts, great ideas for infrastructure in the city, but the truth is, we are not that great at implementation.",21,,
177,0.97,1598.763,1608.106,"When we do implement, it's not done equitably.",21,,
178,0.97,1608.173,1609.04,"Green Lake, Wallingford, ballards.",21,,
179,0.97,1609.107,1611.009,Their baseline pedestrian infrastructure is great.,21,,
180,0.97,1611.076,1614.846,"You can get around in a leafy, green, cool place very easily.",21,,
181,0.97,1614.913,1617.282,It's not the case in the South end.,21,,
182,0.97,1617.349,1632.964,"So I would urge you to come to the South end and compare for yourself what it's like to try to walk around the neighborhood, to ride the bus around to get East or West to do anything.",21,,
183,0.97,1633.031,1646.144,"I say that because I know that investments that we make in the future need to be equitable as we are looking at the comprehensive plan and the transportation plan, and that means we need to start where the need is the greatest.",21,,
184,0.97,1646.211,1659.758,"I look forward to working with you on all of the issues, and I just can't pass the Mic off without letting you know about the happy places in the South end.",21,,

189,0.97,1679.244,1685.15,"Thank you, Morales, and thank you for bringing up the needs for the South end.",22,,
190,0.97,1685.216,1687.519,I concur it's inequitable.,22,,
191,0.97,1687.585,1690.889,"To address that, we have to do more investment there as soon as possible.",22,,
192,0.97,1690.955,1694.092,"We will be getting the Mayor's budget soon, actually.",22,,
193,0.97,1694.159,1698.096,That will be good to see how it's invested.,22,,
194,0.97,1698.163,1703.201,So before I turn it over to Councilmember Herbold.,22,,
195,0.97,1703.268,1710.008,I want to acknowledge Strauss has been here for a long time.,22,,
196,0.97,1710.075,1710.809,Good morning.,22,,
197,0.97,1710.875,1712.343,Thank you for your patient.,22,,
198,0.97,1712.41,1718.75,Sorry I'm a voice and not on camera.,23,,
199,0.97,1718.817,1726.124,I appreciate the opportunity to speak to incoming director Spotts.,23,,
200,0.97,1726.191,1733.631,"I really appreciate his inclusion of the bridge inspection, maintenance, and repair as a priority for his first year and appreciate the focus on vision zero issues.",23,,
201,0.97,1733.698,1746.778,"I do have a couple of questions that didn't make it into the questions document, and then a third that is related to one that did.",23,,
202,0.97,1746.845,1800.331,"The first question came from a constituent who reached out after we had already submitted our questions, and this constituent of West Seattle wrote about your appointment Mr. Spotts and the question is in regards to the realization that one thing that previous Sdot directors have had backgrounds in, specifically, engineering backgrounds is not a background that you share and just wondering how you might address whether or not there are gaps in your experience, abilities, and how you may work to fill the gaps if the gaps do, in fact, exist.",23,,
203,0.97,1800.398,1805.436,Thank you so that.,24,,
204,0.97,1805.503,1811.609,"It's interesting, you know, I'm in my second career.",24,,
205,0.97,1811.676,1819.617,I'm a practitioner in transformation with a public policy masters rather than engineer.,24,,
206,0.97,1819.684,1824.289,There's also many architects in the profession.,24,,
207,0.97,1824.355,1832.063,"I have extensive experience designing, funding, constructing, maintaining capital projects of all different sizes.",24,,
208,0.97,1832.13,1846.444,"I don't design them myself I rely on all kinds of professional staff to do that, but I see myself as someone who shapes those different professionals in a coherent and meaningful way, like conducting an orchestra.",24,,
209,0.97,1846.511,1857.222,"There's the string sections and then the Woodwinds and the percussion, and all have to work together.",24,,
210,0.97,1857.288,1873.271,"You know, my first experiences with capital projects came because I joined the Mayor's staff in the spring of 2009 to run the performance management group, and we were doing formal performance reviews of key mayoral priorities.",24,,
211,0.97,1873.338,1879.677,I wrote up a dashboard on the traffic signal synchronizing.,24,,
212,0.97,1879.744,1891.723,"It would all wire up to a central control center, and my dashboard said that the program was likely to not be finished by the end of the Mayor's second term.",24,,
213,0.97,1891.789,1908.74,"The Mayor asked if I would be willing to take over as the Mayor's lead of that very complex set of projects, and we were able to recover the schedule and bring that back into being completed on time.",24,,
214,0.97,1908.806,1922.887,"Having been successful with that, the Mayor asked me to evaluate our portfolio of the reinvestment and recovery act in the great recession.",24,,
215,0.97,1922.954,1931.696,"The city had $660 million of projects, 100 different grants, and I evaluated all with a red, yellow, and green system with evaluating them.",24,,
216,0.97,1931.763,1949.681,"The end result since a lot were in the red, we stood up a Four- person team to accelerate the projects.",24,,
217,0.97,1949.747,1952.65,I took on $220 million in the infrastructure projects to get them moving.,24,,
218,0.97,1952.717,1971.135,"As a result of that, the Mayor created a new role for me as director of transportation project delivery, and I was the Mayor's lead on a portfolio of regional mega projects, and it was actually a 10 billion dollars portfolio.",24,,
219,0.97,1971.202,1983.748,"In that role I was working on station areas for light rail and heavy rail, and we rebuilt 14 bridges on the I-405 freeway.",24,,
220,0.97,1983.815,1999.163,"In those roles I was interacting with many civil engineers and professionals in the variety of disciplines and utilities and all different folks, and then streets L.A.",24,,
221,0.97,1999.23,2001.432,We have a $350 million capital program.,24,,
222,0.97,2001.499,2006.037,"Projects from 500,000 to $30 million like the one I mentioned previously.",24,,
223,0.97,2006.104,2021.853,In 2021 I was very fortunate to have the chance to oversee the engineering group for about eight months when the previous chief technical officer retired.,24,,
224,0.97,2021.919,2025.256,"I actually have recent experience directly overseeing engineers, architects, and landscape Designers.",24,,
225,0.97,2025.323,2026.958,I will be bringing that with me.,24,,
226,0.97,2027.024,2031.062,"I can also tell you, I'm not buried in the individual plans of the individual projects.",24,,
227,0.97,2031.129,2035.767,I don't see myself as the chief engineer of Sdot.,24,,
228,0.97,2035.833,2037.168,There's people who do that.,24,,
229,0.97,2037.235,2051.549,I want to help shape the collection of projects and challenge the staff to fully realize the industry best practices and be creative and forward looking in the design.,24,,
230,0.97,2051.616,2051.916,Thank you.,25,,
231,0.97,2051.983,2061.959,"My second question was intended to tease out your experience of capital projects, but I think you covered that well, and I don't need to go into that further.",25,,
232,0.97,2062.026,2068.132,I just want to go to my third and last question.,25,,
233,0.97,2068.199,2118.249,"There were some discussions in the questions document you received about sidewalks and as it relates specifically to pedestrian safety and vision zero, but I want to get a little bit more in the weeds about the repair and restoration of existing sidewalks, and we--in 2019, the Council adopted a resolution, resolution 3198, requesting that Sdot develop policy options for maintenance of sidewalks, and this was a result of community advocacy from a group called the coalition of advocates working together rooted in rights.",25,,
234,0.97,2118.316,2128.059,And they really focused on how hazardous uneven sidewalks are for wheelchair users and Vision- impaired people.,25,,
235,0.97,2128.125,2137.702,"After a snowstorm that year, it left many people unable to access the bus stops for an entire week.",25,,
236,0.97,2137.768,2147.612,"In response to that resolution, in 2020, Sdot completed the report that included policy recommendations for sidewalk repair in Seattle.",25,,
237,0.97,2147.678,2168.833,"It was developed with the school at Udub, and in October of last year, the city auditor released a report on Seattle's sidewalk maintenance and repair program, and that city audit report echoed many of the same recommendations that were included in the 2020 report.",25,,
238,0.97,2168.9,2205.97,"I'm just interested to know if you had a chance to review the recommendations for how we might move towards improving the conditions of our sidewalks and whether or not any of--the recommendations have different approaches, recognizing sidewalk maintenance is the responsibility of the homeowner, and just wondering whether or not you have any thoughts.",25,,
239,0.97,2206.037,2206.571,Thank you.,26,,
240,0.97,2206.637,2210.541,"I can start, and if there was more to the question, --",26,,
241,0.97,2210.608,2212.944,"That was it, thank",27,,
242,0.97,2213.01,2213.344,"Okay, great.",28,,
243,0.97,2213.411,2227.425,"Yes, you know, in Los Angeles, we have had many of the same challenges, and I have had a chance to look at many of the sidewalk approaches of different cities and help to make the policy in Los Angeles.",28,,
244,0.97,2227.491,2237.835,"I have reviewed some of the documents you are mentioning here in Seattle, and one thing I am very encouraged about is that Seattle has a sidewalk condition map.",28,,
245,0.97,2237.902,2252.683,"Not every city has that, and if you don't, I'm a firm believer in asset management principles, and if you don't know the condition of all of your assets, it's hard to Prioritize your investment.",28,,
246,0.97,2252.75,2256.754,I think it's commendable that Seattle already has the condition.,28,,
247,0.97,2256.821,2258.522,There's important choices ahead.,28,,
248,0.97,2258.589,2267.531,I remember reading sort of a discussion about making permanent concrete repairs verses Ramping and beveling.,28,,
249,0.97,2267.598,2276.474,"You know, there's some real challenges involved in the Ramping and beveling and whether it makes the sidewalk Ada or whether the repairs are permanent.",28,,
250,0.97,2276.54,2296.027,"I would really like to dig into the issue in depth with the staff and work with this Committee on really developing a game plan that has public support, particularly from those members of our community who are mobility impaired.",28,,
251,0.97,2296.093,2331.462,"I often tell my staff in L.A., just a few Discontinuities, whether it's an uplift or a missing curb ramp or a missing piece of sidewalk, and that can mean the difference between like someone who is mobility impaired and not being able to use our parks, not getting to the bus stop or their medical appointments, and it's absolutely critical that we are thinking about, you know, our most vulnerable users in terms of making a safe and passable, you know, pedestrian system.",28,,
252,0.97,2331.529,2332.963,I'm very passionate about this.,28,,
253,0.97,2333.03,2341.972,"I'm an avid Walker myself, and I'm looking forward to participating in the week without driving coming up as well.",28,,
254,0.97,2342.039,2346.744,"So I hope to collaborate with you, Councilmember, and the whole Committee on this very important topic.",28,,
255,0.97,2346.811,2347.078,Thank you.,29,,
256,0.97,2347.144,2349.18,I appreciate it.,29,,

259,0.97,2357.788,2369.8,"Again, for the viewing public, on the city council Website, the Legistar Website has all 30 plus questions and Mr.",30,,
260,0.97,2368.766,2374.371,Spotts's answer and the formal appointment packet with his resume.,30,,
261,0.97,2374.438,2384.081,There's plenty of information available for the viewing public who are concerned about this issue.,30,,
262,0.97,2384.148,2390.921,Just want to check to make sure there are no other comments or questions.,30,,
263,0.97,2390.988,2391.822,"May I, chair?",31,,

267,0.97,2396.127,2398.262,I wanted to come out here.,33,,
268,0.97,2398.329,2401.098,We have talked about bike lanes and pedestrians.,33,,
269,0.97,2401.165,2405.603,"I didn't know if we talked about trees yet, have we?",33,,
270,0.97,2405.669,2406.837,A little bit.,34,,
271,0.97,2406.904,2413.444,"In terms of resiliency and his experience with that, but I love to talk about trees.",34,,
272,0.97,2413.511,2416.747,"You know, the missing connections, and we have a good network.",35,,
273,0.97,2416.814,2426.39,"We have the good bones of a good network, and there's a fair number of missing connections they know you know makes the Diffeence between whether it's being used or not.",35,,
274,0.97,2426.457,2435.199,"I can tell you from a tree perspective, I look forward to planting for street trees.",35,,
275,0.97,2435.266,2440.471,"Concrete just reflecting and magnifying the heat in negative ways, and we have great opportunities there.",35,,
276,0.97,2440.538,2458.656,"I enjoyed your answers regarding mobility and regarding making the connections, and sidewalks, and we have so many different ways to create sidewalks and safe places for walking, and where we have cars driving around us, and I don't have any questions for you because I already asked them in the written responses that you have provided.",35,,
277,0.97,2458.722,2465.429,"I just want to come out and say hello to you in person, thank you for your great answers, and I'm looking forward to working with you.",35,,

279,0.97,2466.096,2471.535,"It's so good to see you in person, and let's go explore your district together and look at some of the places.",36,,
280,0.97,2471.602,2491.755,"We have some great opportunities, and you know, we have a lot of places that don't have sidewalks at all, and just as the city has continued to expand, year after year, and a lot of Unincorporated King County is part of my district, formerly.",37,,
281,0.97,2491.822,2493.09,I will stop now.,37,,
282,0.97,2493.157,2493.824,"Thank you, chair.",37,,

330,0.97,2693.323,2708.405,"The Council policy decisions have already been made, and today's votes are essentially administer in nature, but we have the central staff here with us.",60,,
331,0.97,2708.472,2715.312,"Before we go into the Sdot presentations, do you have any comments on them?",60,,
332,0.97,2715.379,2719.783,"No, Councilmember described it exactly.",61,,
333,0.97,2719.85,2723.387,They are largely tied to the Developmenting process.,61,,
334,0.97,2723.454,2731.829,They look for Slivers of sidewalks and alleyways that need to conform to our general standards as part of Redeveloping the property.,61,,
335,0.97,2731.895,2734.364,This is administration and part of the regular business.,61,,
336,0.97,2734.431,2735.299,Thank you.,62,,
337,0.97,2735.365,2740.07,"With that, I will over to Sdot.",63,,
338,0.97,2740.137,2745.709,We have bill Laborde and maybe someone else as well.,63,,
339,0.97,2745.776,2748.445,"Bill, welcome.",63,,
340,0.97,2748.512,2750.614,"Thank you, Pedersen.",64,,
341,0.97,2750.681,2752.149,It's just me this morning.,64,,
342,0.97,2752.216,2766.497,"Our person who regularly presents the bills is out today, and I'm pinch hitting for her.",64,,
343,0.97,2766.563,2766.897,Thank you.,65,,
344,0.97,2766.964,2768.932,There we go.,66,,
345,0.97,2768.999,2786.383,"So you sort of covered this, but quickly, the Council bills, all six of them authorizing Sdot to accept the deeds and easements acquired as conditions on the private developmental under the land use code.",66,,
346,0.97,2786.45,2823.487,"In most cases these are wider sidewalks or maybe in some cases places where sidewalks did not exist before but the Right-Of-Way improvement manual requires the new development to create those sidewalks, wider sidewalks, and this is an opportunity for not only improved pedestrian accessibility, but also providing the Department need easements of the sidewalk properties and in such way incorporates them into the Right-Of-Way.",66,,
347,0.97,2823.554,2838.635,"Because all property acquisitions under the city charter are required to be approved by Council, as minor as it may seem, they do require a Council bill and ordinance to be passed.",66,,
348,0.97,2838.702,2839.069,There's six bills.,66,,
349,0.97,2839.136,2845.742,Each have about 20 to 25 different transactions that are bundled together.,66,,
350,0.97,2845.809,2851.148,The--I think it's a total of 121 transactions between the six bills.,66,,
351,0.97,2851.215,2859.056,Right here you can see a couple of examples or one example of what an improved sidewalk would look like.,66,,
352,0.97,2859.122,2881.178,You will see some excerpts from the streets illustrated or Right-Of-Way improvement manual that will show how these easements come about because the sidewalk requirement depends on the street type and part of the city.,66,,
353,0.97,2881.245,2888.185,"And then just to wind things up, it's dedicated pursuit to the land use code.",66,,
354,0.97,2888.252,2914.444,"In this case, dedicated mostly for sidewalks or widening sidewalks, but in some cases streets or alleys, and after the development is complete or while the development is winding down, Sdot provides the environmental due diligence review and records the easements with the county, and then the last step is for your approval with these Council bills.",66,,
355,0.97,2914.511,2927.257,"I am happy to try to answer questions, but I have also provided Gretchen's act information if there's questions.",66,,
356,0.97,2927.324,2942.439,"I appreciate the your team provided to me last week on this to again, know, that it is administrative in nature, and these are small Slivers that are being handed over to the city at no cost to us.",67,,
357,0.97,2942.506,2949.212,So I plan to move these out of committee this morning if we can.,67,,
358,0.97,2949.279,2958.655,"Councilmembers, any comments or questions about the six bills?",67,,
359,0.97,2958.722,2958.955,Okay.,67,,

380,0.97,3021.685,3032.529,"Thank you, think it counts as abstention, unless they say so, so I believe it's maybe just four in favor.",79,,
381,0.97,3032.596,3033.163,Four in favor.,80,,
382,0.97,3033.23,3034.398,Four in favor?,81,,

389,0.97,3062.759,3086.716,"We have with us today members from the school traffic safety committee to present their 2022 annual report, and as far as people may know, it's a group of 11 members made up of representatives from Seattle public schools, the Seattle Department of transportation, Seattle police Department, King County Metro, and volunteer members.",84,,
390,0.97,3086.783,3101.164,I really appreciate--the Seattle Department of transportation helps to provide staff support to the six advisory committees that advice us on transportation matters.,84,,
391,0.97,3101.231,3119.749,"Really appreciate Sdot's support with that, and also everybody volunteering their time for this important Committee, and Ashley Rhead is here with us, and also saying hello to some of the volunteer members.",84,,

402,0.97,3165.262,3190.186,"I just want to mention that there was apparently a lull in the report to the committee, and when we were meeting with the police Department one time, they suggested that we get it going again so that you know what we are up to and how we can all work together to make sure that it is a vibrant, fun city for children to walk and roll to school.",86,,
403,0.97,3190.253,3194.724,So this is our 2022 annual report.,86,,
404,0.97,3194.791,3200.03,"Next slide, please.",86,,
405,0.97,3200.096,3208.805,"Well the next slide when we get it--perfect, will give background on what the committee is.",86,,
406,0.97,3208.872,3225.221,"1975, and as mentioned, I don't know about unique, but it's an interesting city board because it has members from a bunch of different organizations, the public schools, I frequently find people don't know are a state institution.",86,,
407,0.97,3225.288,3227.157,Obviously the D.O.T.,86,,
408,0.97,3227.223,3235.465,"And police Department are city institutions, and then Metro is obviously the county institution.",86,,
409,0.97,3235.532,3247.577,"It's a multiple bureaucracy situation in which worst case everyone can say it's someone else's problem, and best case we can come together and work our angles and fit the pieces of the puzzle together to go better.",86,,
410,0.97,3247.644,3253.216,I'm one of the five volunteer positions as mentioned earlier.,86,,
411,0.97,3253.283,3262.759,We are lucky to have probably not the most robust but fairly robust public participation because they are issues people care about.,86,,
412,0.97,3262.826,3267.03,"Once they discover there's a place to go with it, they come.",86,,
413,0.97,3267.097,3267.364,Next slide.,86,,
414,0.97,3267.43,3274.804,"And so when they come, they come because we have a number of pretty great responsibilities.",86,,
415,0.97,3274.871,3280.777,We are where to come if you have an issue about school traffic safety.,86,,
416,0.97,3280.844,3305.869,"The independent agency, more or less that gets to use the Sdot data to figure out where crosswalk locations and crossing guard locations are needed, and that is based on the ever-changing situation in our city with schools and Arterials and speeds.",86,,
417,0.97,3305.935,3319.482,"That does need to be updated fairly often, and similarly with bullet three, and that is traffic circulation.",86,,
418,0.97,3319.549,3341.071,"The city experiences population changes and always needs to update the school building, and we look at when those change, and we have had a big win last year on making those reviews about student safety.",86,,
419,0.97,3341.137,3346.976,"We have some upcoming slides about more improvements, continuous improvements.",86,,
420,0.97,3347.043,3356.319,"Elementary walk boundaries, making sure they match the skills and abilities of the elementary school students.",86,,
421,0.97,3356.386,3358.555,"Kind of frustrating, crossing guard recruitment.",86,,
422,0.97,3358.621,3364.961,"We need help with that, and as mentioned earlier we connect different entities.",86,,
423,0.97,3365.028,3365.261,Next slide.,86,,
424,0.97,3365.328,3366.73,So what are the top needs now?,86,,
425,0.97,3366.796,3375.338,"We also got to present to the school board recently, which is great because as we say, multiple, multiple people.",86,,
426,0.97,3375.405,3385.582,"The things we are hoping for them is to help with the crossing guard recruitment, and to look at the transportation standards.",86,,
427,0.97,3385.648,3390.987,"We will tell you more about that, but it's a school board thing.",86,,
428,0.97,3391.054,3404.434,"For the city, we have some city code adjustments that we will be talking about that would really help keep things focused on student safety.",86,,
429,0.97,3404.501,3410.039,There's two different aspects on that with different bullets on that.,86,,
430,0.97,3410.106,3426.756,"Another perennial, always more sidewalks because as Mary Ellen once said, we now have Kindergarteners, particularly in the North end and South end, walking to school in the dark on streets with no sidewalks, which is not the best.",86,,
431,0.97,3426.823,3429.626,"All right, so next slide.",86,,
432,0.97,3429.692,3433.429,Some great wins to talk about.,86,,
433,0.97,3433.496,3435.899,Sdot changed the requirements for Crosswalks and Four-Way stops.,86,,
434,0.97,3435.965,3451.481,"One of the things that happens a lot, family members come in and say we can't seem to get a stop sign in front of the school.",86,,
435,0.97,3451.548,3451.681,Why?,86,,
436,0.97,3451.748,3452.582,Now we can.,86,,
437,0.97,3452.649,3454.017,This is really exciting.,86,,
438,0.97,3454.083,3454.551,It's already happening.,86,,
439,0.97,3454.617,3461.591,Ashley can probably tell us all the plays she can do it now.,86,,
440,0.97,3461.658,3461.791,Yay.,86,,
441,0.97,3461.858,3462.292,A new police board.,86,,
442,0.97,3462.358,3467.831,"The previous one retired, and we were sad.",86,,
443,0.97,3467.897,3469.833,Now we have a new one.,86,,
444,0.97,3469.899,3472.335,"Officer Davenport, a Motorcycle police officer.",86,,
445,0.97,3472.402,3473.636,This is not him.,86,,
446,0.97,3473.703,3475.805,This is another officer.,86,,
447,0.97,3475.872,3476.272,"Yay, that's great.",86,,
448,0.97,3476.339,3476.606,Next slide.,86,,
449,0.97,3476.673,3481.578,"This is another exciting win that we don't take any credit for, but we are excited about it.",86,,
450,0.97,3481.644,3490.353,It will help to fill in the gaps about free youth transit and we are very excited.,86,,
451,0.97,3490.42,3507.503,We also want to start to continue to appreciate the city for helping the District make these things work with that combined funding position that is about bus passes.,86,,
452,0.97,3507.57,3507.77,"So, Yay.",86,,
453,0.97,3507.837,3509.672,Next slide.,86,,
454,0.97,3509.739,3513.776,This is another big win.,86,,
455,0.97,3513.843,3515.612,"Thank you, Sdot.",86,,
456,0.97,3515.678,3552.849,"We have always had an example of genesis in West Seattle, we hoped for a number of years to offer that as an option for other schools because it seems to address a number of issues that families, communities routinely bring to us, and so I'm happy to talk about the details of it, but you know, making lemonade out of lemons, and the pandemic helped to make this happen in a Low-Stress way for all concerned.",86,,
457,0.97,3552.916,3560.723,"We expect as people get used to it, we will see more and more of this happening around schools, and it will be great.",86,,
458,0.97,3560.79,3580.877,"And I can say that because the example and Ashley and Sdot are good at getting the word out, people across the U.S. are now Referencing us for this, and that's fun.",86,,
459,0.97,3580.944,3581.844,Next slide?,86,,
460,0.97,3581.911,3584.414,Sarah Collin is also on the meeting.,86,,
461,0.97,3584.48,3587.45,The direct result of the city understanding the goals now.,86,,
462,0.97,3587.517,3608.938,"Now funding a position at the District for safer schools, which is super exciting because it provides someone who can be on the inside, approving things that need access to student data, which the rest of us for very good reasons are not supposed to be seeing.",86,,
463,0.97,3609.005,3620.583,"There's a whole bunch of stuff she is already doing, and she just started in April.",86,,
464,0.97,3620.65,3620.984,No pleasure.,86,,
465,0.97,3621.05,3626.289,It will get better from here.,86,,
466,0.97,3626.356,3626.823,Next slide.,86,,
467,0.97,3626.889,3627.223,Now challenges.,86,,
468,0.97,3627.29,3631.227,"Not too many zombies in Seattle normally, be there's things to cover.",86,,
469,0.97,3631.294,3633.062,"With the next slide, Mary Ellen will take over.",86,,
470,0.97,3633.129,3633.763,"Thank you, Margaret.",87,,
471,0.97,3633.83,3636.766,"I just want to say, thank you for having us here.",87,,
472,0.97,3636.833,3644.674,"We really appreciate the opportunity to put the issues in front of you, and I'm just going to touch on the first couple of slides briefly.",87,,
473,0.97,3644.741,3648.344,These are the ones we were really highlighting for the SPs school board.,87,,
474,0.97,3648.411,3668.364,"We do want you to know that we are pushing them as well, all the time, to try to focus on some of the issues and when we push Sdot and city Council, please know we are bothering everybody.",87,,
475,0.97,3668.431,3670.7,We want to reduce crossing guard vacancies.,87,,
476,0.97,3670.767,3673.736,They had come down prior to the pandemic.,87,,
477,0.97,3673.803,3685.882,"They had been high, 40%, down to 30%, and we lost crossing guards when they were furloughed and many are retirees who are more concerned about Health-Issues related to Covid.",87,,
478,0.97,3685.948,3698.861,"We are hoping to bring this back down, and part of that is a lot of advertising Sdot has been good enough to amplify that on their Blog.",87,,
479,0.97,3698.928,3700.897,We appreciate that assist.,87,,
480,0.97,3700.963,3701.33,"Next slide, please.",87,,
481,0.97,3701.397,3703.599,The comprehensive update to the service standards.,87,,
482,0.97,3703.666,3719.749,"One thing that SPs for a long time has really only looked at Busing as the transportation, not really considering the fact that half of the students are ineligible for Busing, and half of them get to school another way.",87,,
483,0.97,3719.816,3732.862,The city's funding of the safe routes to school coordinator at SPs is a big step in changing that and providing support for the families who don't have any assistance in getting kids to school.,87,,
484,0.97,3732.929,3734.497,We are appreciative of that.,87,,
485,0.97,3734.564,3751.814,"Now it's in place, and we are asking Seattle public schools to take a look at the comprehensive service standards and think of how else they can respond to the needs of not just kids in buses, but there are improvements to be made there as well, but all students.",87,,
486,0.97,3751.881,3752.348,"Next slide, please.",87,,
487,0.97,3752.415,3769.565,"Now this is one that we are wanting to highlight for Council today, and we have talked about this previously, and one thing we observed when we are looking at the circulation plans for schools is that city code for school projects is very out of date.",87,,
488,0.97,3769.632,3771.734,It's not realistic at all.,87,,
489,0.97,3771.801,3779.842,The number of parking spaces that schools would be required to build are on some sites completely impossible.,87,,
490,0.97,3779.909,3786.215,"You pave the entire playground, and you make the building smaller, and you still can't get it done.",87,,
491,0.97,3786.282,3798.928,"So what this means is that Seattle public schools has to go through departures at nearly every single project, and there's a handful of repeat offenders, and it's bus loading.",87,,
492,0.97,3798.995,3804.767,"You have to go through departures to deep it as is, not even change it.",87,,
493,0.97,3804.834,3826.722,"The number of parking spaces is astronomical, completely impossible, and silly ones like building heights which seems like it makes sense, except that even just to change out the Hvac equipment on top of the building, they have to go through a departure process just to upgrade the furnace on the building.",87,,
494,0.97,3826.789,3835.031,"The Signage, the Signage is one that, you know, all of the signs are allowed by departures, the same way every time, but according to code, you can't do it.",87,,
495,0.97,3835.097,3859.822,"It's another one that causes them to have to go through the departures, and we have had meetings about this, and I have Spoked to Councilmember Pedersen and Councilmember Strauss about it, and we have had meetings, and everyone agrees that Sdci said flatly they think it should change, and it doesn't make a lot of sense.",87,,
496,0.97,3859.889,3860.89,It doesn't add anything.,87,,
497,0.97,3860.957,3869.799,"It's question of getting it Prioritized, and the delay process with the departure is the big problem.",87,,
498,0.97,3869.865,3873.903,"Money is allocated years in advance, and departures can be appealed.",87,,
499,0.97,3873.97,3881.744,Every delay is eating away at how much building you can buy because of inflation because the money does not grow over time.,87,,
500,0.97,3881.811,3885.081,You're just waiting to get the construction done.,87,,
501,0.97,3885.147,3893.456,"It adds up to $2.5 million every year that just Evaporates, and it doesn't add anything to the project.",87,,
502,0.97,3893.522,3932.795,"So we have heard from Councilmember Strauss and Councilmember Pedersen's offices that they are coordinating with the Mayor, and this is moving this year, and we have also SPs has heard from I believe Nathan Trogelson is his name, they are looking at this, and we really applaud that, and we would really encourage making sure you follow up on this to make sure this is the year it changes so we can stop just losing this Tax-Payer money and start getting more schools, more Playgrounds, and more of everything that we want for our kids without having to spend any more money.",87,,
503,0.97,3932.862,3942.004,"This seems like if we could just get the political will to get it done, this is a common sense fix to make a huge difference for kids.",87,,
504,0.97,3942.071,3945.174,We encourage you to please stay on top of it.,87,,
505,0.97,3945.241,3951.48,"I know there's a million priorities, but please make it a priority for this year.",87,,
506,0.97,3951.547,3951.814,Next slide.,87,,
507,0.97,3951.881,3952.114,Thank you.,87,,
508,0.97,3952.181,3966.629,And then another thing we have observed during the process of being involved in the early reviews is that Sdot does not always respond to schools as we would hope.,87,,
509,0.97,3966.696,3973.369,"You know, as Margaret pointed out, schools are a part of the state government, not part of the city government.",87,,
510,0.97,3973.436,3979.175,As a result we have seen that Sdot does not always view them as a partner.,87,,
511,0.97,3979.241,3991.454,"They view them as any old applicant that is coming in, and we are going to get as much as we can in terms of Street improvements.",87,,
512,0.97,3991.52,4000.463,"While we understand that, you know, that is intended to maximize the public benefit, it's really often not doing that on schools.",87,,
513,0.97,4000.529,4033.896,"We have seen requests for improvements that are not geared towards the safety needs of schools, and then we have also seen that once the process is done and permits are in hand and construction has started, there's inconsistency among the Sdot inspectors, and if the person who is the inspector changes out in the middle of the problem for some reason, then suddenly it's like you have not done this work across multiple years to get everyone on the same page to agree what needs to be done.",87,,
514,0.97,4033.963,4035.097,You have to start over.,87,,
515,0.97,4035.164,4040.269,"I want this and this, and this is what they said, and this is what I said.",87,,
516,0.97,4040.336,4042.371,That is a huge problem.,87,,
517,0.97,4042.438,4045.808,"It causes Changeovers, cost overruns, and delays in the middle of construction.",87,,
518,0.97,4045.875,4049.412,We are asking for two things.,87,,
519,0.97,4049.478,4056.952,We are asking for no surprises commitment they will honor what the previous staff have agreed to in writing on a project.,87,,
520,0.97,4057.019,4067.696,We had a really productive meeting at the last school traffic safety committee with members from the is Sdot group.,87,,
521,0.97,4067.763,4075.504,"We think this is improving now, and we are hoping to be able to make a better report on this next year.",87,,
522,0.97,4075.571,4090.286,The other thing we would like to ask Sdot creates a policy that directs staff to focus on school traffic safety when reviewing these not general neighborhood car output.,87,,
523,0.97,4090.352,4107.336,If we are looking at the dollars that are publically funded and are these dollars that we are pulling out of the project to use on Street improvements giving us the most bang for our buck at the site if we are pulling them away from vital educational uses?,87,,
524,0.97,4107.403,4120.783,"We would like a policy that just directs Sdot to formally considering maximizing the public good, not just the transportation benefits when looking at the school projects.",87,,
525,0.97,4120.85,4121.383,"Next slide, please.",87,,
526,0.97,4121.45,4141.504,"And then the pedestrian programs this is one we have brought to you before, and it seems like there's never enough, but the truth is that Sdot builds 25 blocks of sidewalks a year, and 2400 blocks within a quarter of the miles of schools don't have sidewalks.",87,,
527,0.97,4141.57,4145.407,"As Margaret touched on, that's a lot of kids walking to school.",87,,
528,0.97,4145.474,4155.885,"Kids whose families don't necessarily have other options, and they do it, you know, in the rain, in December, when it's pitch black, and they need to be able to get to school safely.",87,,
529,0.97,4155.951,4180.809,"We just want to remind you as you head into the season, something you know and something they think is easy to get lost when you're looking at very many important priorities, that a choice to Prioritize sidewalk funding to increase the pedestrian programs funding is also a choice to Prioritize the student safety.",87,,
530,0.97,4180.876,4181.31,"Next slide, please.",87,,
531,0.97,4181.377,4211.006,"And so this is just a review of what we asked the school board for, and if you go to the next slide, and the summary of what we are looking to really find more money for the pedestrian programs to fill in gaps in walking routes to schools, update city code to eliminate the habitual departures, and let our taxpayer money build more schools instead of going to the process.",87,,
532,0.97,4211.073,4222.484,"And then on the school streets, which are a wonderful new program, we would like you to ask Sdot to add effective physical markers for school streets.",87,,
533,0.97,4222.551,4232.094,"It's new, and right now they just have Signage, and that is something that should be explored going forward, what does the street treatment look like in the future?",87,,
534,0.97,4232.161,4243.872,"And then Lastly, direct Sdot to have a policy that focuses requirements for school projects on the needs of those school communities.",87,,
535,0.97,4243.939,4244.173,Next slide.,87,,
536,0.97,4244.239,4261.724,"And then we, I think all of us just want to say we appreciate the opportunity to do this work and we appreciate you taking the time to listen to us, and we look forward to continuing working to improve traffic safety for kids in the coming year.",87,,
537,0.97,4261.79,4279.408,"Thank you commitment to safety for school children throughout Seattle and for doing all of this hard thinking about what to Prioritize and what does the school district need to do, and what does the city government need to do?",88,,
538,0.97,4279.475,4286.915,Hearing your call to action for the Seattle Department of construction and inspection and also the Seattle Department of transportation.,88,,
539,0.97,4286.982,4310.739,"So I am supportive of many of the things you are recommending here, and we will hope to see some of this in the budget that we get from the executive departments, and then do some regulatory work through the committees, and Councilmembers, any comments or questions here?",88,,
540,0.97,4310.806,4311.34,Councilmember Strauss?,88,,
541,0.97,4311.407,4319.748,"Thank you, chair it's really great to see you folks.",89,,
542,0.97,4319.815,4322.751,"Mary Ellen and Margaret, we have met about this.",89,,
543,0.97,4322.818,4324.119,"Noa, great to see you.",89,,
544,0.97,4324.186,4327.723,"Ashley, thank you for your work.",89,,
545,0.97,4327.79,4337.7,"I know you talked about departures, that's not a city transportation issue, but since our conversation, I have talked to members of the Mayor's office, and I think we have a route ahead for that.",89,,
546,0.97,4337.766,4345.207,I just want to take this moment to really appreciate your presentation and reaching out to me personally as well.,89,,
547,0.97,4345.274,4357.653,"The information you provided me allows us to do a better job, and I think that's why in this conversation I can say the issues about departures is on our docket, and that's because of you.",89,,
548,0.97,4357.72,4363.592,The feedback loop of having you come before us and share and meet with us individually is very helpful.,89,,
549,0.97,4363.659,4369.398,I just wanted to pipe in and say keep up the great work.,89,,
550,0.97,4369.465,4370.499,"Thank you, Strauss.",90,,
551,0.97,4370.566,4374.136,I thought you may have good news to report on the front.,90,,
552,0.97,4374.203,4379.742,I'm glad you Chimed in.,90,,
553,0.97,4379.808,4380.275,Thank you.,90,,
554,0.97,4380.342,4381.31,Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Herbold.,90,,
555,0.97,4381.376,4383.612,I don't have to turn anything.,91,,
556,0.97,4383.679,4389.451,"I'm looking for how to Unmute myself, but I don't have to do that now.",91,,
557,0.97,4389.518,4389.852,"Thank you, all.",91,,
558,0.97,4389.918,4394.923,"This is really, really important work that you're doing.",91,,
559,0.97,4394.99,4403.398,"I have two kids in Seattle public schools, and I know how critical it is that we make sure our students can get around safely.",91,,
560,0.97,4403.465,4416.311,"I am just wondering, and you mentioned a little bit about the stay healthy streets and the sidewalk issue.",91,,
561,0.97,4416.378,4430.692,"And I know that it's very expensive to build, repair sidewalks, and I'm wondering, one of the things we have also talked about, it is--I'm going to forget the name of it now.",91,,
562,0.97,4430.759,4431.093,Home zones?,91,,
563,0.97,4431.16,4432.227,Is that right?,91,,
564,0.97,4432.294,4432.494,Yeah.,92,,
565,0.97,4432.561,4432.895,"Okay, sorry.",93,,
566,0.97,4432.961,4453.682,"I'm just wondering if you have thought about other treatments that could be done around schools, I mean, I'm certainly supportive of as many sidewalks as we can, but I'm wondering if you have thought about other things that could make it easier and safer for our students to get to school?",93,,
567,0.97,4453.749,4464.56,"Well, so, yes, know, Ashley, you have been working on home zones.",94,,
568,0.97,4464.626,4470.532,Do you want to Chime?,94,,
569,0.97,4470.599,4471.033,I can.,95,,
570,0.97,4471.099,4506.535,"We have several examples right now, and it's--the home zone program is separate from safe routes to school, but they do serve schools and do the projects around the schools, so they are, you know, like you said, Councilmember Morales, they are working on developing, using the new tool essentially to increase the amount of safe space for people to walk in their neighborhoods and walk to destinations like schools, and they also, at times that does include sidewalks.",95,,
571,0.97,4506.602,4554.983,"For example, around Rainier view, right now, it's one of our High-Priority schools because of the demographics of the schools and also the near complete lack of sidewalk infrastructure within the walk zone, and we have several million dollars that we have been able to bring together from safe routes to school funding, home zone funding, and a Council budget action passed last year for sidewalks in district two, and so we have been able to bring together funds from a few different sources, and the home zone program is doing a really great comprehensive outreach to a group of neighbors that are working together on pedestrian safety in their neighborhood, and then also engaging with the school, school leadership, their PTA, and families.",95,,
572,0.97,4555.05,4567.763,"They are doing that kind of comprehensive Neighborhoodwide look at how do we build--how do we build the connected network so people can get to, you know, bus stops, networks, and other destinations within the neighborhood.",95,,
573,0.97,4567.829,4573.168,"As I said, that's something that is going on around Olympic hills as well.",95,,
574,0.97,4573.235,4585.514,"Every year the home zone program is taking on new projects in New parts of the city, and they definitely Prioritize the schools when identifying the neighborhoods to work with.",95,,
575,0.97,4585.58,4589.851,"Ashley, do you know how many blocks get home zones every year?",96,,
576,0.97,4589.918,4592.654,How many home zones each year?,97,,
577,0.97,4592.721,4595.857,"I mean, we were about it's 25 new blocks of sidewalks.",98,,
578,0.97,4595.924,4597.259,I see what you mean.,99,,
579,0.97,4597.326,4600.829,That's 100 done.,100,,
580,0.97,4600.896,4608.971,"If we did home zones instead, do you know the rate of construction?",100,,
581,0.97,4609.037,4610.572,I don't know that.,101,,
582,0.97,4610.639,4611.306,I could find out.,101,,
583,0.97,4611.373,4626.054,"It depends on the size of the home zone determined off the community process, and the community kind of comes together and determines what are the bounds of the home zone, and it might be bigger or larger depending on the neighborhood.",101,,
584,0.97,4626.121,4630.659,"I could, Yeah, I could find out how many blocks are included within the home zones each year.",101,,
585,0.97,4634.83,4640.469,"Okay, thank you, would love to follow up on you with that.",102,,
586,0.97,4640.535,4654.182,"That was part of the rational behind putting the Council budget action in, knowing that, you know, as Mary Ellen said it will take us 300 years to build the sidewalks.",102,,
587,0.97,4654.249,4658.82,What else can we do to increase safety and stretch the dollars farther?,102,,
588,0.97,4658.887,4674.469,"I am definitely interested in working with all of you to move us in that direction so that our students can get around the neighborhoods safely, and everybody can get around and access the goods and services that they need a little bit more easily.",102,,
589,0.97,4674.536,4674.77,Thank you.,102,,
590,0.97,4674.836,4678.306,I will also follow up with you and Councilmember Strauss on the land use issues.,102,,
591,0.97,4678.373,4682.711,I'm interested in seeing what we need to do there.,102,,
592,0.97,4682.778,4683.712,Thank you.,103,,
593,0.97,4683.779,4686.982,Thank you.,104,,
594,0.97,4687.049,4687.482,Councilmember Herbold.,104,,
595,0.97,4687.549,4689.951,Thank you so much.,105,,
596,0.97,4690.018,4714.543,"I want to echo my colleagues' appreciation for the work you are doing, and also really thankful to chair Pedersen for having your briefing before us so soon before the Mayor ANNOUNCES his 2022 budget so your recommendation is fresh in our mind as we move into the budget cycle.",105,,
597,0.97,4714.609,4719.581,I do have one question about the crossing walk program.,105,,
598,0.97,4719.648,4738.2,"I understand the large percentage of vacancies, I think upwards of 35% vacancies right now, that's attributable to people who are older, and they are leaving, doing that work.",105,,
599,0.97,4748.076,4762.157,"-- Covid, and I'm wondering what has led to an assessment of how to increase recruitment and reduce barriers to becoming a crosswalk.",105,,
600,0.97,4762.224,4762.858,Yeah.,106,,
601,0.97,4762.924,4764.593,Thank you for the question.,106,,
602,0.97,4764.659,4778.073,"So part of the problem has been since Seattle public schools took over the crossing guard program from the police, I think it was 15 years ago now, there's always been a high vacancy rate.",106,,
603,0.97,4778.14,4782.544,Sps has been afraid to fill the empty spots because they didn't have dedicated funding.,106,,
604,0.97,4782.611,4803.899,"That was fixed just about a year before the pandemic started when they--the stop Paddle tickets on buses tickets for people who don't stop for stopped buses was implemented, and by state law it has to go to traffic safety improvements, and that's been paying for crossing guards.",106,,
605,0.97,4803.965,4807.002,"After that, we made a big push and saw improvements.",106,,
606,0.97,4807.068,4810.305,It's a difficult position to fill.,106,,
607,0.97,4810.372,4812.24,"It's two hours, two Nonconsecutive hours a day.",106,,
608,0.97,4812.307,4821.249,"As we mentioned in the slides, one of the things we are really asking SPs to do is wave the Upfront fee for background checks.",106,,
609,0.97,4821.316,4831.86,"For someone on a fixed income who is interested in making $32 a day at a job, $55 up front fee is a substantial hurdle.",106,,
610,0.97,4831.927,4855.784,"So we are hoping that we can make another big push just to let people know the jobs are out there, and they are paid while also eliminating the issue that slows down and discourages people from coming, you know, finishing the process, and between those, we can start to see the rate substantially come down this year.",106,,
611,0.97,4855.85,4861.389,So are you saying like a falloff between applying for the position and sort of --,107,,
612,0.97,4861.456,4861.79,Yeah.,108,,
613,0.97,4861.856,4863.792,The last step?,109,,
614,0.97,4863.858,4864.059,Yeah.,110,,
615,0.97,4864.125,4865.16,That's interesting.,111,,
616,0.97,4865.227,4873.435,The crossing told us it's pretty common that people say actually I have to wait until next month's check comes in before I can pay that.,112,,
617,0.97,4873.501,4877.505,"A month later, maybe they have moved on or, Yeah, there's falloff.",112,,
618,0.97,4877.572,4878.907,"All right, thank you.",113,,
619,0.97,4878.974,4879.574,Appreciate the information.,113,,
620,0.97,4879.641,4890.952,I just want to also hoping that having the safe route school person at the District may help.,114,,
621,0.97,4891.019,4911.172,"It's usually someone who lives nearby who is interested and wants to help the neighbors and Whatnot, and you know I have a full-time job and three kids and all of that stuff, and as a committee we have not been able to develop the PTA and schools without PTA connections to sort of do that.",114,,
622,0.97,4911.239,4911.773,The D.O.T.,114,,
623,0.97,4911.84,4924.686,"Was working with the police Department to put up signs on the intersections saying we need a crossing guard here, and that was remarkably effective.",114,,
624,0.97,4924.753,4925.053,It was great.,114,,
625,0.97,4925.12,4929.224,Those like very specific local interactions are what build --,114,,
626,0.97,4929.291,4929.824,Generates interest.,115,,
627,0.97,4929.891,4930.292,"That's great, Yeah.",115,,
628,0.97,4930.358,4950.679,"That's all thanks to city Council and the city of Seattle allocating the funding for the position, now that we expect to see a lot of improvements, and this is her first year, full-time year, starting at it, but we are incredibly happy she is there and very thankful that city council took that on.",116,,
629,0.97,4950.745,4955.05,Thank you so you.,117,,
630,0.97,4955.116,4964.426,"Thank you, and I can, for those able to, we can continue to advertise the positions in the newsletters sent out to constituents.",118,,
631,0.97,4964.492,4970.699,It's a nice thing to add in there to encourage people to become crossing guards.,118,,
632,0.97,4970.765,4985.046,"Well, again, thank you all for this report, and there are several Followup items, and so we will stay in contact with you, and we appreciate the good work that you are doing for us and for being here today with this report.",118,,

661,0.97,5081.342,5084.913,We were here last on I think March 15th to give an update.,131,,
662,0.97,5084.979,5099.027,Really excited to be back to check in on the progress and let folks know and Councilmembers know how and what is coming up in terms of engagement and the process.,131,,
663,0.97,5099.093,5102.997,So thank you so much Council chair and Committee for having us today.,131,,
664,0.97,5103.064,5106.935,We will talk about three things.,131,,
665,0.97,5107.001,5111.272,I will provide the quick overview of the Stp planning process and where we are.,131,,
666,0.97,5111.339,5124.619,Joanna will chat about the engagement of what has been going on and what to expect over the next few months and give an update on the key milestones over the next 12 months.,131,,
667,0.97,5124.686,5143.171,"So on the next slide, just a reminder this transportation plan is our long-range plan, and we are looking out 20 years to 2044, and this is the prep for providing safe, affordable options to connect the city.",131,,
668,0.97,5143.238,5151.613,"On the next slide, we will talk about four key goals for the effort.",131,,
669,0.97,5151.679,5155.717,The first is collectively Reimagining our vision for the system.,131,,
670,0.97,5155.783,5162.29,We will be working closely with the comprehensive planning team.,131,,
671,0.97,5162.357,5175.503,We have multiple points of weekly and Bi-Weekly Checkins and project,131,,
672,0.97,5181.109,5188.917,We are working keep in sync.,132,,
673,0.97,5188.983,5198.927,We are looking at the sound transit investments of the light rail and better bus service across the city and how we leverage that.,132,,
674,0.97,5198.993,5210.004,Other key changes likely impacts of Covid and changes in technology and autonomous vehicles will certainly gain Traction during this planning and thinking about the impacts and how we manage that.,132,,
675,0.97,5210.071,5232.961,"On the second point here, planning for people and building on the excellent foundation of our modal master plan and walking and Biking, transit and freight and how we think about those networks and how they work together to meet our community's needs.",132,,
676,0.97,5233.027,5245.073,"On the next slide, I'll talk more about the values of how we have this through the process and then, about the engagement.",132,,
677,0.97,5245.139,5270.598,"On the Sdot values during that with equity, safety, mobility, livability and excellence, we work to carry these through at each step in the process and constantly checking ourselves and our process and our engagement strategies against these values.",132,,
678,0.97,5270.665,5276.204,"Then, our work in the plan against what we call our priority goals.",132,,
679,0.97,5276.27,5290.018,"Under the climate action side, we see a downturn in total carbon emissions in the city but we need much more significant progress to achieve the goal established by the city and the city Council and the carbon neutral transportation system by 2050.",132,,
680,0.97,5290.084,5314.909,"On the equity side, this summer, our colleagues released a transportation equity framework, developed with the work group of a similar name with excellent work and we've identified several dozen strategies and tactics of the network that we are advancing in this process.",132,,
681,0.97,5314.976,5322.183,"Of course, that includes more equity and focused engagement strategy and you will hear from Joanna about that.",132,,
682,0.97,5322.25,5330.625,"On the safety side, you heard about the ethics safety, an important ledge to create a safe transportation system.",132,,
683,0.97,5330.692,5335.763,"Of course, you know that some of our most vulnerable users of the streets are seeing fatal crashes headed in the wrong direction.",132,,
684,0.97,5335.83,5345.84,How do we work with the city to bend that curve in the opposite direction?,132,,
685,0.97,5345.907,5366.661,"On the stewardship side, three keys are the stewardship of our dollars in Sdot and how we get the best use of those public dollars and the maintenance side, streets, bridges and other assets and how we leverage those investments and on the risk management side, as well.",132,,
686,0.97,5366.728,5399.761,"In the blue box you see the key elements and when you see the finished product next summer and at the draft next spring, you will see those key pieces and I will draw attention to the funding and priority framework strategy and in the development, we are working closely with our future funding package teams, the package that will replace our current levy.",132,,
687,0.97,5399.827,5408.169,"I will pass it off at this point, to Joanna, to talk about our engagement process and the next milestones.",132,,

690,0.97,5410.805,5421.349,"In terms of the schedule, this is a reminder the project launched in March 2022 and the planning process for the Stp is expected to last until June 2023.",133,,
691,0.97,5421.415,5432.994,We envision the Mayor will transmit the planning document with the components listed in the previous slide to city council.,133,,
692,0.97,5433.06,5446.107,Our public engagement is the vision to take place during three distinct phases as shown in the slide before you and it allows the feedback on technical elements of the plan.,133,,
693,0.97,5446.174,5466.36,We've been hyper focused on making sure that we are Co- creating the Stp with our community and I'm happy to report that we just completed our phase 1 of public engagement during this phase with a lot of robust conversation with our community around values and goals and how we measured progress and what the key priorities are.,133,,
694,0.97,5466.427,5516.777,"We are getting ready to kick off our next phase of that and continuing the conversation we have with phase 1 and in the interest of Co-Creation, going back to confirm and see if we got it right and what we had put together in regards to the values and goals and if they reflect what we heard from the community and confirming that with them and Additionally, as part of phase 2, starting to define the future of our transportation system, including the menu actions and what they could look like, consistent with the values and goals we've heard from the community and exactly how and where those changes should be made.",133,,
695,0.97,5516.844,5545.973,"Phase 3 of the public engagement plan will occur early next year, in anticipation of transmitting the plan to Council to include continuing to build on phase 2 to confirm some of those Venues of action and also, starting to hear feedback on Prioritization and the criteria of items and how we Prioritize and how we fund the plan and where to Prioritize dollars.",133,,
696,0.97,5546.04,5551.679,"Again, Harkening back, our goal is to finish the Stp by summer 2023.",133,,
697,0.97,5551.746,5554.181,A question from Councilmember Morales.,134,,
698,0.97,5554.248,5558.953,I don't know if go through the whole presentation?,135,,

701,0.97,5566.294,5582.009,"I will probably come back later, but the big picture, I'm interested in how this process with the vision and the goals setting Aligns with the coming of our vision and goal setting.",137,,
702,0.97,5582.076,5599.026,"The departments are working closely together but as that process determines how our neighborhoods will change and grow, I'm wondering how Sdot will adapt if those goals don't align, given that it is planned for completion a year after this was?",137,,
703,0.97,5599.093,5604.298,"Thank you, a great question.",138,,
704,0.97,5604.365,5615.109,"On the front end, our schedules are really closely aligned.",138,,
705,0.97,5615.176,5619.413,"As you get to the later months, the comprehensive planning team has time to wrap things out.",138,,
706,0.97,5619.48,5628.089,"On the Front-End, the policy framework, the visions, values and goals portions, we will be able to stay in sync with them.",138,,
707,0.97,5628.155,5658.452,"As we get into the recommendations portions and the specifics of responding to the growth strategy, we should have at least a refined direction or some level of clarity on the growth direction and we will be developing transportation strategies that help support the direction we see the city going.",138,,
708,0.97,5658.519,5659.92,"As well, potential contingencies, if there is some certainty there.",138,,
709,0.97,5659.987,5663.758,Thank you.,138,,

713,0.97,5679.006,5706.167,"So, as we were finishing off the phase 1 engagement and is part of this process, I wanted to tie into our goals of engagement, to ensure that we are Uplifting the voices of communities we have not traditionally heard from before, as part of our planning processes.",140,,
714,0.97,5706.233,5714.275,We purposely designed the engagement strategy that partners with Community-Based organizations around the Community-Based organizations.,140,,

726,0.97,5843.47,5855.583,"We have over 2100 surveyed participants and input into what you are seeing, as a graphic of where we have received interactive comments.",140,,
727,0.97,5855.649,5872.099,"As you can see, we've had some success with citywide outreach but continue to revise and Pivot are engagement strategies as we continue to analyze who we are hearing from and areas we hear from to ensure that we are hearing from everyone.",140,,

731,0.97,5905.566,5924.318,We've heard from lot of respondents saying that we should focus on sidewalks and bike lanes to help people walk and bike more and putting money toward transit to make it more convenient and reliable with top priorities from the community.,140,,

747,0.97,6059.82,6080.707,"Joanna, when I briefing on this, you had noted that the heat map is for interactive map comments and might not have included other outreach efforts in the other areas of the city.",146,,
748,0.97,6080.774,6080.974,Yeah.,147,,
749,0.97,6081.041,6081.341,That's correct.,147,,
750,0.97,6081.408,6081.875,Thanks for the reminder.,147,,
751,0.97,6081.942,6093.253,The graphic represented is part of one aspect of our phase 1 engagement which was collecting input into our social pinpoint mapping system.,147,,
752,0.97,6093.32,6108.235,"In addition to this, we had In- person engagements that included survey participation and submit all comment cards.",147,,
753,0.97,6108.302,6117.578,"We are still digesting that information to get a grasp of where we were able to receive that information, as well.",147,,
754,0.97,6117.644,6119.48,There will be supplementary information that can give additional Info on where gaps are.,147,,
755,0.97,6119.546,6128.589,"As I mentioned to Councilmember Herbold, there is a lot of opportunities and I look forward to working with you to ensure voices are being heard.",147,,
756,0.97,6128.655,6131.225,Thank you.,148,,
757,0.97,6131.291,6131.959,Thank you.,149,,
758,0.97,6132.025,6145.973,"If there's no, just closing it up here with a few more slides.",150,,
759,0.97,6146.039,6176.136,"So, in regards to our phase 2 engagements, which we hope to next 12 months, again, or the emphasizing hearing back and going back to our community and continuing the concept of Co- creation and confirming the goals with the vision statements and the values and making sure that is reflected in some of those Deliverables and elements of the plan that we are developing.",150,,
760,0.97,6176.203,6198.859,"Additionally, the menu action with a strategic direction to understand the goals and objectives and bringing exercises within our community to understand where the community would like to see some of these big moves and changes.",150,,
761,0.97,6198.926,6205.966,"Also, what they would support in regards to getting to some of those goals and objectives.",150,,
762,0.97,6206.033,6212.739,"Additionally, continuing to build on education methods to reach Underrepresented communities.",150,,
763,0.97,6212.806,6218.445,"As I shared, analyzing the community efforts to prevent and refine and insure that we engage, citywide.",150,,
764,0.97,6218.512,6231.858,"In regards to some upcoming milestones coming up, the next slide shows what we have on deck for the remainder of the project.",150,,
765,0.97,6231.925,6257.484,"It includes the launch of phase 2 and September and during this next fall, reflecting our internal technical analysis with what we hear from the community, including the modal network integration and components of the plan and the modernization tax or the menu of actions to update our networks.",150,,
766,0.97,6257.551,6267.728,"In 2023, we aim to publish a plan for review that will subsequently align with the phase 3 launch of community engagement.",150,,
767,0.97,6267.794,6271.965,"Again, the target of transmittal of the Mayor's recommended plan to city council in September.",150,,
768,0.97,6272.032,6277.871,Our last slide shows where you can direct folks too.,150,,
769,0.97,6277.938,6288.448,"As I shared, it would be helpful and we would love to work with you about how to push out these two to your constituents.",150,,
770,0.97,6288.515,6292.719,We have a lot of handouts and flyers and links and we would appreciate your help in being able to share with the community.,150,,
771,0.97,6292.786,6297.19,I'll stop there and ask people for any questions.,150,,
772,0.97,6297.257,6297.724,Thank you.,151,,
773,0.97,6297.791,6299.326,Councilmember Morales?,151,,
774,0.97,6299.393,6303.23,Thank you.,152,,
775,0.97,6303.296,6313.306,"I do have a question, but I first want to go back to a couple of things you said, Joanna.",152,,
776,0.97,6313.373,6329.089,"I think I need to understand the timing better between phase 1 and phase 2. you know, that map definitely shows that based on that particular map, you've heard a lot about well Resourced and better Resourced neighborhoods.",152,,
777,0.97,6329.156,6348.809,"As I look at slide nine, the Noth and on the South end of Seattle, certainly--so--I understand and am happy to spread the word that you are looking for more feedback to the survey.",152,,
778,0.97,6348.875,6375.869,"But, if the intent of phase 1 is to establish the vision and goals and you haven't heard from a large part of the city, I feel like it's premature to talk about Trade-Offs in phase 2 before you've actually been able to compile the rest of that information and whatever else you might be hearing from what the city that is Underrepresented in your survey.",152,,
779,0.97,6375.936,6384.277,"Can you just talk more about what that process will be, to hear from people, before you move into phase 2?",152,,
780,0.97,6384.344,6392.853,"Comic Morales, the thing I will add that I probably didn't emphasize as much as at the map you are showing is representative of the social activity we completed.",153,,
781,0.97,6392.919,6398.825,It was how we received the mapping feedback.,153,,
782,0.97,6398.892,6419.813,"In addition, I want to reference our work with our Community-Based organizations and community liaisons that are receiving feedback and we are putting those summaries together right now as part of the phase 1 engagement.",153,,
783,0.97,6419.88,6433.727,I wanted to point to that because that is where a lot of our partnerships and outreach to those communities--you may be seeing our gaps reflected in the maps.,153,,
784,0.97,6433.794,6436.53,"That's what we are targeting, in regards to outreach with a lot a partnership with Community-Based organizations.",153,,
785,0.97,6436.596,6482.809,"They are in South Seattle and the South Park area . So, we have a partnership with focus outreach that we've been doing with those communities that will be Inputted as part of the phase 1 feedback . You know, not necessarily just spatial input, but more information and detail in survey and our Community- based organizations have been running some In-Language exercises with them, and order to be able to receive similar feedback, as we've been doing through the Online activities.",153,,
786,0.97,6482.876,6493.086,"Again, the map doesn't completely reflect that and that is something we will continue to work on when you hear from us in the next round.",153,,
787,0.97,6493.153,6514.875,We can more clearly refine and show the citywide effort that has been occurring but there has definitely been a lot of different layers to the phase 1 activities . that is also beyond just the mapping exercise that you are seeing.,153,,
788,0.97,6514.941,6520.18,I appreciate that and appreciate you mentioning the In-Language translation.,154,,
789,0.97,6520.247,6528.922,That is obviously really important to make sure we hear from everybody and I appreciate that you provided this map to give us a sense of the work you've done.,154,,
790,0.97,6528.989,6529.923,And we haven't heard from people so thank you.,154,,
791,0.97,6529.99,6536.93,Thank you.,155,,
792,0.97,6536.997,6553.713,I do want to ask--I appreciate this and it's helpful to understand where you are in the process and this presentation is mostly about engagement and doesn't share about the actual alternatives that have been presented.,155,,
793,0.97,6553.78,6562.222,"Can you talk first about the alternatives included in the analysis and then I have a couple of questions about what some folks are asking for to be included, as well.",155,,
794,0.97,6562.289,6566.66,Sure.,156,,
795,0.97,6566.726,6569.129,"For the alternatives discussion, Jonathan?",156,,
796,0.97,6569.195,6594.054,"Thank you, we just concluded our CPO Scoping comment period a few weeks ago and are busy processing and going through the comments we've received and as well, coordinating the comprehensive team who had that comment period that I believe just closed.",157,,
797,0.97,6594.12,6617.344,"It was extended a little bit longer with a comment period than ours and we are coordinating on our approach to the alternatives together, to make sure that the alternatives for setting are in sync with the alternatives.",157,,
798,0.97,6617.41,6626.186,"We are working to shoot joint responses to the comments and as well, the alternatives that we will be analyzing in the Sepa process to gather.",157,,
799,0.97,6626.252,6636.062,We have three or so weeks before we can put that out and we are working closely on them with that.,157,,
800,0.97,6636.129,6636.997,That hasn't been yet?,158,,
801,0.97,6637.063,6649.042,The comment but we went finalized our responses and the alternatives we will be working on.,159,,
802,0.97,6649.109,6650.543,That's right.,159,,
803,0.97,6650.61,6652.178,Okay.,160,,
804,0.97,6652.245,6674.1,"So, we are hearing from community members who are really advocating for accelerating the shift to Multimodal options and for being intentional about how we prepare our transportation infrastructure to accommodate what people are referring to as a 15 minute city.",160,,
805,0.97,6674.167,6675.935,This is why I'm asking.,160,,
806,0.97,6676.002,6679.739,"I'm interested, especially Aligning with the comprehensive plan and the work that is happening there.",160,,
807,0.97,6679.806,6687.58,"You know, I've been advocating for the kind of neighborhoods where everybody has access to essential goods and services.",160,,
808,0.97,6687.647,6705.732,We heard from the new appointee about Accessing grocery stores and child care and medical appointments without getting in the car.,160,,
809,0.97,6705.799,6723.983,"I'm really interested to know if what we propose includes an idea like that, to really make our complete streets work and actually implement the things we've been talking about, literally.",160,,
810,0.97,6724.05,6740.5,"Thank you, yes, on the Land-Use side, the comprehensive planning team is considering--I believe, because Council very pointedly asked them to, the 15 minute concept, a community notes concept.",161,,
811,0.97,6740.567,6762.155,"Our alternatives will certainly be looking at what types of actions we need to take to achieve the carbon neutral admissions, which does require a substantial increase in walking and Biking and transit trips.",161,,
812,0.97,6762.222,6767.66,We will work closely with that and collaborate with the complement team on those options.,161,,
813,0.97,6767.727,6772.932,Thank you.,161,,
814,0.97,6772.999,6775.235,Thank you.,162,,
815,0.97,6775.301,6779.439,"Thanks for those answers, Jonathan and Joanna and thanks for this presentation and laying out the Timeline, going forward.",162,,
816,0.97,6779.506,6794.42,We will definitely ave you back at the committee and we can have you back several times as you hit milestones and you need input for certain milestones.,162,,
817,0.97,6794.487,6800.493,We will definitely ask you to come back and let us know when you think the best time to come back is and we can accommodate that.,162,,
818,0.97,6800.56,6812.138,"If no other comments or questions for this team, we will move on to the final item on today's agenda.",162,,
819,0.97,6812.205,6819.045,With the clerk please read the full title of the final agenda item?,162,,
820,0.97,6819.112,6823.75,Agenda item 10 solid waste with the briefing and discussion.,163,,
821,0.97,6823.816,6824.684,Okay.,164,,
822,0.97,6824.751,6830.623,"Transportation has been taking up, has been the Star of the show so far.",164,,
823,0.97,6830.69,6831.257,"Is it the best for last, maybe?",164,,
824,0.97,6831.324,6845.004,Will have this information item but it will be voted on as early as September 20 and this concerns public utilities and solid waste rates for 2023- 2025.,164,,
825,0.97,6845.071,6858.718,We've got a draft on the agenda with the presentation and we will vote on September 20.,164,,
826,0.97,6858.785,6875.602,"I'm pleased that the Spu proposal seems to maintain the utility high quality services waste with rates that are well below inflation, and terms of the adjustments.",164,,
827,0.97,6875.668,6897.957,"Keeping promises, Spu proposed rate increases are consistent with the projected rate path from the strategic business plan adopted by the Council in May 2021 and we will talk about one of the key pieces and key lines of business, disposing of solid waste bid that is trash, recycling and compost.",164,,
828,0.97,6898.024,6902.395,"We have our general manager and Ceo, Andrew Lee.",164,,
829,0.97,6902.462,6914.941,Welcome and I acknowledge Brian goodnight from the city council central staff that is reviewing these materials thoroughly for Councilmembers and I wanted to open it up with the introductory remarks for this today.,164,,
830,0.97,6915.008,6917.243,Thank you.,165,,
831,0.97,6917.31,6923.916,I don't have introductory remarks and I will turn it over to Seattle public utilities.,165,,
832,0.97,6923.983,6924.317,Thank you.,165,,
833,0.97,6924.384,6926.419,"Andrew Lee, good",166,,
834,0.97,6926.486,6931.19,Thank you members of the committee.,167,,
835,0.97,6931.257,6954.113,"We will present the solid rates proposal for 2023-2025 and as you know, Spu has three lines of business, water, drainage and waste water and solid waste and each utility has revenue sources and capital improvement projects but they share many operations and activities with the city.",167,,
836,0.97,6954.18,6962.755,"Like comic Pedersen mention, the solid waste utility processes recycling, Compostable and residential and commercial garbage.",167,,
837,0.97,6962.822,6964.857,Rates are set on a three-year schedule with one rate proposal for each line of business each year.,167,,
838,0.97,6964.924,6986.679,"We propose previous solid waste rates for 2020, 2021 and 2022 and they were adopted by the Council in 2019 in this current rate period Conversely is 2023, 2024 and 2025 and the new rates would go into effect April 1 of each year.",167,,
839,0.97,6986.746,6997.957,I will hand off this presentation to Karl Stickel with more details and how it ties back to the strategic business plan.,167,,
840,0.97,6998.024,7006.332,It was just adopted recently.,167,,
841,0.97,7006.399,7012.338,"Before proceeding further, I want to ask if community members have questions before I handed off to Carl.",167,,
842,0.97,7012.405,7021.18,"If not, I will hand it off to Karl.",167,,
843,0.97,7021.247,7021.748,Hello.,168,,
844,0.97,7021.814,7029.021,I'm Karl Stickel with the Finance division of Seattle public utilities and I'm here to talk about solid waste rates.,168,,
845,0.97,7029.088,7032.992,"As Andrew mentioned, the rates are typically on a three-year schedule with one rate study per year.",168,,
846,0.97,7033.059,7045.471,"This year, it is the solid waste rate turn and we have forecasted rates for the next three years from 2023 through 2025 and I will walk you through our proposal.",168,,
847,0.97,7045.538,7053.579,"Next slide, please.",168,,
848,0.97,7053.646,7073.232,"Previewing the rate path, you can see that I will touch on this solid waste system to give you context and we will dive into proposed rates and the impact to customer bills and then highlight the next steps in the process.",168,,
849,0.97,7073.299,7076.169,Here's our proposed rate path and you see two tables.,168,,
850,0.97,7076.235,7105.765,"The top table is the rate path you endorsed last year as part of our six-year plan and the gray shaded boxes were adopted in an ordinance at the time and you will notice in the lower right-hand corner that the combined six-year average rate is 4.2% that you are approved and the good news, the lower table represents our current proposal, including our proposed solid waste rates.",168,,
851,0.97,7105.832,7120.446,The overall rate is actually lower than that of what we thought it would be last year as part of the strategic business plan at 4.0% . I like to point out a couple of things on this table.,168,,
852,0.97,7120.513,7129.555,The strategic business plan was approved last year and there have been two approved rate studies.,168,,
853,0.97,7129.622,7132.325,One for water and one for drainage and wastewater with the newly shaded areas.,168,,
854,0.97,7132.391,7145.938,Those adopted rates were actually lower than what we assumed in the strategic plan which helps us with our overall rate being kept lower.,168,,
855,0.97,7146.005,7178.037,"The second thing to mention was that our current proposal also assumes the increase in the King County wastewater treatment rate which went up and that will be subject for another piece of legislation that you will see separately on September 20 and also, we've included our 2023-2024 proposed budget cost within the rate path as well and you will see the proposed budget later when Mayor Harrell formally transmits the budget.",168,,
856,0.97,7178.104,7189.916,"That said, the key take away is that the combined overall SP rate path goes from 4.2% down to 4.0%.",168,,
857,0.97,7189.982,7198.925,"Here is a little more detail on the solid waste rates, themselves.",168,,
858,0.97,7198.991,7215.241,"What we had assumed in the strategic business plan on the very top line, for the six-year period, an average of 2.4% in the rates in bold on the second line are the updated proposed rates for your consideration.",168,,
859,0.97,7215.308,7222.848,"In some cases, the rate is lower like in 2023 and the rate is the same in 2024 and then takes up in 2025.",168,,
860,0.97,7222.915,7235.294,You are adopting rates and the 2026 rate is our current estimate right now.,168,,
861,0.97,7235.361,7241.901,I put that into show consistently the six-year strategic business plan.,168,,
862,0.97,7241.968,7263.122,"Probably the only change worth mentioning here is contract assumptions as part of our agreements for solid waste services with our contracts having provisions that can impact rates, particularly in 2025 for fuel, CPI and labor costs.",168,,
863,0.97,7263.189,7272.531,"All told, solid waste moved from .1% from the assumed rate of 2.4% to the adopted rate of 2.5%.",168,,
864,0.97,7272.598,7283.409,"For the bills to the customers, I will get to that in a minute but first I wanted to provide a brief overview of our solid waste system, just to give you context for what we do and how we do it.",168,,
865,0.97,7283.476,7296.722,This shows a high level overview of solid waste and how it's collected in the city and the majority of solid waste services are contracted out to a number of companies.,168,,
866,0.97,7296.789,7302.962,Solid waste is either collected by contractors or you can bring it in yourself to the transportation source.,168,,
867,0.97,7303.029,7311.003,"We own and operate the two transfer stations, North and South.",168,,
868,0.97,7311.07,7319.812,"We provide yard waste, organic recycling, garbage for single and multifamily households and as well, commercial customers.",168,,
869,0.97,7319.879,7339.365,"To give you the magnitude of the services we provide, we have 168,000 residential garbage cans and we have 5300 multifamily and 8100 commercial large bins.",168,,
870,0.97,7339.432,7349.041,"As you know, waste is processed and disposed of in different ways, depending on the waste stream.",168,,
871,0.97,7349.108,7358.784,"For recycling, our collection contractors, Waste management and Ecology, Hall recycling direct to Republic services at the facility at third and Lander.",168,,
872,0.97,7358.851,7377.47,"Yard waste and organic material is to the transfer station and processed in Snohomish county in STANWOOD and Cedar grove, with facilities in Everett and in the valley.",168,,
873,0.97,7377.536,7385.144,Garbage is delivered as well and transported by train to a landfill in Oregon.,168,,
874,0.97,7385.211,7395.521,This is the tonnage numbers compared to population.,168,,
875,0.97,7395.588,7404.13,"Recycling and Organics are more than half of the waste stream, 54% and rising.",168,,
876,0.97,7404.196,7417.009,"As population increases, the majority of added tonnage is from recycling and Organics with a smaller Uptick in garbage.",168,,
877,0.97,7417.076,7427.153,"It's lower than population growth, and that is a good thing.",168,,
878,0.97,7427.219,7438.664,The ultimate study is to set rates at a level that covers expenses and ensures financial stability for the fund.,168,,
879,0.97,7438.731,7441.467,"Residential is the largest share, in terms of revenues and includes single and multifamily customers.",168,,
880,0.97,7441.534,7453.879,Commercial is the next largest and transfer stations are a growing part of the revenue stream.,168,,
881,0.97,7453.946,7461.52,"Other revenue is recycling commodity revenues, and that is when we sell Recyclables to processors.",168,,
882,0.97,7461.587,7473.465,"For expenses, solid waste contracts are, by far, the largest piece of the pie, consisting of over 50% of total expenditures.",168,,
883,0.97,7473.532,7484.71,"These are the green huge pieces for single-family, multi-family and commercial with collections, processing and disposal costs for those customers.",168,,
884,0.97,7484.777,7501.994,"We also have utility taxes paid to the city and state and as well, debt service for our bonds and the other is the branch expenses used to run our solid waste operations.",168,,
885,0.97,7502.061,7519.778,"The solid waste fund is guided by financial policies that are adopted by you, the city Council and here are the current financial policies set for the solid waste fund with net income that we want to be positive.",168,,
886,0.97,7519.845,7560.119,"Debt service coverage is a measurement of our income available to pay our current debt obligations and the policy is to have it at or greater than 1.7 times that obligation and year-end cash balances, a good measure of financial stability of the utility that makes sure we have cash on hand for operation of the utility with the adopted policy and the policies to keep a certain number of days of cash available to pay our contract expenses and our operations.",168,,
887,0.97,7560.185,7567.059,We want to make sure we aren't to use leverage with capital improvement projects.,168,,
888,0.97,7567.126,7577.803,We currently have healthy cash balances to finance our capital program with cash in the foreseeable future and we don't anticipate having to go out for any debt.,168,,
889,0.97,7577.87,7595.587,"The 2021 Actuals for 2022, we currently are exceeding all the financial policies and project to continue to meet or exceed financial policies for the rate study period.",168,,

891,0.97,7595.888,7596.588,Next slide.,168,,
892,0.97,7596.655,7606.165,"As mentioned, the rate schedule, typically set on a three-year schedule with Ron rate study per year and you can see they are staggered.",168,,
893,0.97,7606.231,7618.143,"The dark blue area is adopted into ordinance and this year, we are doing solid waste rates and the rate period is 2023- 2025, that medium blue color.",168,,
894,0.97,7618.21,7627.386,"If adopted, the solid waste rates go into effect April 1, 2023.",168,,
895,0.97,7627.453,7636.895,"Circling back to the proposed rates, the solid waste is coming in at 2.5% for the strategic period.",168,,
896,0.97,7636.962,7650.776,"As part of that rate, solid waste collection service will have annual increases and transfer stations are set to have one increase period in 2023.",168,,
897,0.97,7650.843,7663.188,"The combined Spu rate path would be at 4%, the lower Right- hand corner, down from the assumption of 4.2%.",168,,
898,0.97,7663.989,7665.424,This next slide shows the impact of the rate change on bills to customers.,168,,
899,0.97,7665.491,7686.678,"These two tables show the typical monthly residential bill for the adopted strategic business plan period, the top table, compared to the proposed rates at the bottom table.",168,,
900,0.97,7686.745,7692.384,Uc it's relatively unchanged between the strategic business plan and the proposed plan.,168,,
901,0.97,7692.451,7697.823,The combined typical bill is actually lower in the proposed scenario.,168,,
902,0.97,7697.89,7700.492,The lower differences are the green numbers below.,168,,
903,0.97,7700.559,7709.168,"Overall, good news for our customers and that is the savings they should see in their overall bills.",168,,
904,0.97,7709.234,7714.54,You may also be interested in seeing where we stack up against the other cities with monthly bills.,168,,
905,0.97,7714.606,7735.16,"It's not 100% Apples-To-Apples, but the closest we could get in from this comparison, the solid waste services are around the same level as San Francisco and slightly higher in Portland and Tacoma.",168,,
906,0.97,7735.227,7748.006,"On the right-hand side, it's worth mentioning that Seattle offers the most comprehensive portfolio services in the region, including collection, transfer, processing and disposal.",168,,
907,0.97,7748.073,7750.476,"We own and operate our own station, requiring a significant capital investment.",168,,
908,0.97,7750.542,7764.123,"Also, as a result, we are subject to guidelines that bring a cost associated with it.",168,,
909,0.97,7764.189,7777.302,"In terms of next steps, my understanding is this proposal will be on the agenda at the next Committee hearing on September 20 with central staff presenting the analysis.",168,,
910,0.97,7777.369,7789.681,"If it's voted out of committee at that time, it's a full Council on September 27 and possible vote and if adopted, the race would be effective April 1, 2023.",168,,
911,0.97,7789.748,7795.954,I will turn it back to Andrew.,168,,
912,0.97,7796.021,7802.895,"At this point, or I are happy to answer questions about this proposal.",169,,
913,0.97,7802.961,7814.64,Thank you very much will turn it over to my colleague in a moment but this has been presented in such a professional and neutral way that I want to lift up things I'm excited about.,170,,
914,0.97,7814.706,7828.22,"As we know, utility bills are repressive with lower income households paying a greater portion of their household income for these bills.",170,,
915,0.97,7828.287,7851.543,"The rate increases being as low as possible are important to hundreds of thousands of Ratepayers and we appreciate Seattle public utilities keeping their promise on the rate path we approved, managing all the lines of business in a fiscally responsible manner, including solid waste.",170,,
916,0.97,7851.61,7856.348,Thank you for your vigilance in doing that.,170,,
917,0.97,7856.415,7862.688,"The increase in the recycling and Composting is terrific, considering our population is increasing.",170,,
918,0.97,7862.754,7873.098,Having that proportionally higher as time goes on is terrific and you are amazingly strong with the debt coverage and that is important to keep the agency sustainable in the long term.,170,,
919,0.97,7873.165,7873.732,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",170,,
920,0.97,7873.799,7889.848,I'm very whether or not we are engaging with the EPA panel and the solid waste rates review.,171,,
921,0.97,7889.915,7904.963,"As it relates specifically to the decrease in solid waste rates, I'm interested to know what is driving those costs down?",171,,
922,0.97,7905.03,7927.753,"Lastly, one of the slides showed an Uptick in 2025. the increase in 2025, higher than previously projected.",171,,
923,0.97,7927.819,7932.624,Yeah.,172,,
924,0.97,7932.691,7944.069,"Councilmember Herbold, I can answer the first part and Karl could dive into the specifics on the individual years in the decrease versus the increase.",172,,
925,0.97,7944.136,7946.805,"Councilmember Herbold, we got with the customer panel to be informed on all of our rates.",172,,
926,0.97,7946.872,7955.847,This most recent rate proposal did not go through the customer review panel for approval.,172,,
927,0.97,7955.914,7961.486,The primary review authority is over the strategic business plan which they approve.,172,,
928,0.97,7961.553,7973.832,I can't remember if it was last year or the year before but was consistent with the Spp and in line with what they approved.,172,,
929,0.97,7973.899,7978.837,I was going the remaining questions.,173,,
930,0.97,7978.904,7995.02,"Councilmember Herbold, we are gaining benefit in terms of the overall bills going down in the early years, 23 and 24.",173,,
931,0.97,7995.087,8000.025,Solid waste rates are generally the same but a little bit lower in 2023 and the same in 2024.,173,,
932,0.97,8000.092,8017.843,"For 2025, it is taking up a little bit and that has to do with our contracts that we have with our solid waste services and there is some impact to the contracts for fuel and labor cost and CPI.",173,,
933,0.97,8017.909,8027.252,That is driving the .1% in solid waste rates going up a little bit.,173,,
934,0.97,8027.319,8041.767,"But, we are benefiting, overall, from the savings that we were able to accomplish in the water and drainage and wastewater ordinances that were approved last fall.",173,,
935,0.97,8041.833,8055.113,They are a bit lower than what we had assumed and we are getting some savings based on those lower rates over all with rates going down in that instance.,173,,
936,0.97,8055.18,8055.514,Very helpful.,174,,
937,0.97,8055.58,8062.287,Thank you.,174,,

941,0.97,8081.406,8085.677,"If there are no other comments or questions, I think Councilmember Herbold had a previous hand up?",175,,
942,0.97,8085.744,8096.354,I will assume that previous.,176,,
943,0.97,8096.421,8097.322,Thank you.,176,,
944,0.97,8097.389,8109.668,"Colleagues, if there are no further comments or questions, we will all come Spu back in September 20 and that was the last item on our agenda so I will complete the meeting.",176,,
