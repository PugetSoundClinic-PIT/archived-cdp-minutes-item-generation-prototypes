56,0.97,222.121,234.4,"We haven't done that in the past but I want to make sure if there's folks listening in and they're not in our line to testify and they're on the listed in line, that's an indication to them they need to give us a call on the public testimony line.",20,,

61,0.97,274.173,275.108,Please go ahead.,20,,

64,0.97,283.116,283.783,"Howard, good morning.",20,,
65,0.97,283.783,284.717,Please go ahead.,20,,
66,0.97,284.717,285.151,Good morning.,21,,
67,0.97,285.151,304.07,This is Howard Gayle from district 7. this morning you're going to be looking at the SPD budget $4.7 million of that budget is for the office of police accountability which has failed to stop or hold accountable the vast majority of officers for the abuse of the last four months which now continues.,21,,
68,0.97,304.07,317.617,"There have been near death experiences, brain trauma, loss of sight, 13 officers standing around while they watch a woman who was falsely arrested have seizures repeatedly.",21,,
69,0.97,317.617,324.49,"Severe burn and concussion wounds, just this Monday we saw an officer brandishing a gun at protesters without cause.",21,,
70,0.97,324.49,328.027,We saw a police officer run a bike across a Protester's neck.,21,,
71,0.97,328.027,332.965,The response of the OPA to that case was to refer this for criminal charges.,21,,
72,0.97,332.965,338.171,Raising the obvious question as to why none of the other abuse was so treated.,21,,
73,0.97,338.171,347.38,It highlights the fact that far too much of the OPA's nearly $5 million budget is actually been used this summer to avoid accountability.,21,,
74,0.97,347.38,379.979,"So please, I'm begging the Council, as part of Defunding and Reimagining public safety and police, please Defund an accountability system which has not provided accountability and Reimagine having public safety with accountability based on a citizen investigative model on citizen accountability and not on spending $5 million basically to paper over the police abuse.",21,,
75,0.97,379.979,382.915,Thank you.,21,,
76,0.97,382.915,384.317,"Thank you, Howard.",22,,
77,0.97,384.317,386.686,"Melissa, good morning.",22,,
78,0.97,386.686,395.161,Just Star 6 to Unmute yourself.,22,,
79,0.97,395.161,395.428,Hello?,23,,
80,0.97,395.428,397.497,"Good morning, Melissa.",24,,
81,0.97,397.497,399.532,Hi.,25,,
82,0.97,399.532,400.7,Thanks for taking my comments.,25,,
83,0.97,400.7,432.832,"I am in district 4 and I have been fighting for black lives during these protests this summer and I'm just appalled at SPD's response, at the Mayor's response, at the city government's response to what happens when you stand up for black lives and the police have been, I mean my daughter had a flash bang explode on her knee that she's still scarred from it.",25,,
84,0.97,432.832,439.872,I know that's very minor compared to other things that have been happening especially to people in the black community.,25,,
85,0.97,439.872,446.512,Please I urge you to Defund SPD.,25,,
86,0.97,446.512,446.746,Please.,25,,
87,0.97,446.746,447.146,I yield my time.,25,,
88,0.97,447.146,457.023,"Thank you for calling in this morning, Melissa.",26,,
89,0.97,457.023,457.59,"Katie, good morning.",26,,
90,0.97,457.59,458.09,"Good morning, Katie.",26,,
91,0.97,458.09,458.724,Good morning.,27,,
92,0.97,458.724,460.66,Can you hear me?,27,,
93,0.97,460.66,462.795,We can.,28,,
94,0.97,462.795,463.196,Thank you.,28,,
95,0.97,463.196,464.597,Good morning.,29,,
96,0.97,464.597,466.999,My name is Katie.,29,,
97,0.97,466.999,477.577,I am in district 2. I'd like to say thank you for siding on the right side of the future and helping us build the start of things with this last overriding of the veto.,29,,
98,0.97,477.577,486.052,That was a big moment in history and I know it was probably a hard decision and appreciate stepping on a limb.,29,,
99,0.97,486.052,486.886,"However, just the start.",29,,
100,0.97,486.886,493.359,We do need to work on Defunding SPD this next year by at least 50%.,29,,
101,0.97,493.359,498.998,I'm going to ask we try to work for 80% because as we know when we asked for 50 we didn't quite get it.,29,,
102,0.97,498.998,508.307,Maybe if we ask for more we can work on it because this is the road to Abolishment at the end of the day.,29,,
103,0.97,508.307,529.028,When Jenny Durkan put out her recent budget she invested more into the police than black communities and I find that to be rather backwards considering police traumatized black community so much and it just shows we would like to invest in the black community and rebuilding it.,29,,
104,0.97,529.028,539.071,We know Preventative measures is investigating in youth and giving them resources and opportunities to not go on to the streets.,29,,
105,0.97,539.071,546.345,"Grocery stores so they don't have to walk a mile to the grocery store, things like that and get caught up in even before they get there.",29,,
106,0.97,546.345,554.987,It's very important that we continue this process in finding a way to Defund and abolish the police completely.,29,,
107,0.97,554.987,568.1,"That'll truly build a society that we are desiring today as we can invest more in education, more in the youth and more into social services and mental health and domestic violence counselors and all of those things.",29,,
108,0.97,568.1,576.609,This is on behalf of all of the morning March.,29,,
109,0.97,576.609,576.943,Thank you.,29,,
110,0.97,576.943,577.209,Great.,30,,
111,0.97,577.209,581.013,Thank you very much.,30,,
112,0.97,581.013,581.781,The next four speakers.,30,,
113,0.97,590.022,593.693,"Quan, I want to note it says you're not present, as well as Kelly.",30,,
114,0.97,593.693,605.738,"If you are listening in on the listen in line, please do follow the instructions for dialing back in to our zoom meeting here so we can have you present.",30,,
115,0.97,605.738,606.639,That's for Quan and Kelly.,30,,
116,0.97,606.639,614.113,I'm going to go to the two listed as present.,30,,
117,0.97,614.113,614.68,That's Leah.,30,,
118,0.97,614.68,615.247,"Good morning, Leah.",30,,
119,0.97,615.247,616.082,"Hi, good morning.",31,,
120,0.97,616.082,618.05,Can you hear me?,31,,
121,0.97,618.05,619.452,"Yes, thank you.",32,,
122,0.97,619.452,620.786,Thank you.,33,,
123,0.97,620.786,634.033,"Hi, my name is Leah in district 4. I'm calling, first I would like to thank the city council for overriding the veto as Katie said we know that was a hard decision being made and we appreciate you sticking to your word.",33,,
124,0.97,634.033,650.449,"I would like to say as a district 4 member, Alex Pedersen, please learn more from folks about the navigation team that you so love to support because they are not trusted and they are not reaching out and giving the support that you think they are.",33,,
125,0.97,650.449,656.455,They are often leading to police Sweeps.,33,,
126,0.97,656.455,659.692,By disclosing where camps are and they are not trusted.,33,,
127,0.97,659.692,664.23,Please learn more from people working directly with these Encampments.,33,,
128,0.97,664.23,677.877,I'm doing a lot of neutral aid with groups . please Defund SPD preponderance I've marched with the morning March.,33,,
129,0.97,677.877,685.151,We're seeing the brutality of SPD that mirrors the brutality.,33,,
130,0.97,685.151,688.187,I really am hoping that Seattle will stay strong.,33,,
131,0.97,688.187,697.296,That all of you will stay strong and bold so we can be an example to the country.,33,,
132,0.97,697.296,705.271,Please do not let Jenny Durkan take money from the jump start tax and put it into the money she's promising.,33,,
133,0.97,705.271,708.274,That money needs to come from SPD.,33,,
134,0.97,708.274,727.86,"Not other money you had planned to put into useful programs for youth, education, housing, food security, all these other important needs that this money for the hundred million that she's saying that she's promising to Bipoc communities here needs to come from SPD.",33,,
135,0.97,727.86,735.234,I yield my time.,33,,
136,0.97,735.234,737.636,"Jessie, good morning.",34,,
137,0.97,737.636,749.882,"I want to note again for Quan and Kelly, we do not see you listed as present so please do dial back in to the number that was offered for the public testimony line.",34,,
138,0.97,749.882,752.918,"Jessie, I see you.",34,,
139,0.97,752.918,753.853,Please go ahead.,34,,
140,0.97,753.853,754.153,Thank you.,34,,
141,0.97,754.153,757.59,Thank you.,35,,
142,0.97,757.59,758.958,I'm a district 2 voter.,35,,
143,0.97,758.958,767.466,"First off, thank you for listening to your constituents and supporting our will to start the process of Defunding the Seattle police Department.",35,,
144,0.97,767.466,773.973,I acknowledge that was a big step for a lot of folks on the Council and I want to thank you for that.,35,,
145,0.97,773.973,777.109,But the work is a lot bigger.,35,,
146,0.97,777.109,790.723,Want you to recognize the proposed budget is austerity for Bipoc and working communities and a blank check for a police Department that has killed and violently oppressed the people of this city with impunity.,35,,
147,0.97,790.723,793.592,As we can see OPA is worthless.,35,,
148,0.97,793.592,799.431,There's no justice there and there's no reform there even.,35,,
149,0.97,799.431,812.545,We would really encourage you to listen to the demands of people and take an enormous chunk from the Seattle police Department and put it into actual public safety that actually keeps us safe because there's massive need in this community.,35,,
150,0.97,812.545,818.651,People are literally starving in our streets and all we're doing is buying bullets.,35,,
151,0.97,818.651,819.018,It's grotesque.,35,,
152,0.97,819.018,839.872,"While I understand that my experiences are very limited and the police are, have abused so many people that we don't even know about, I was personally viciously beaten and arrested for no reason, charges weren't ever brought against me and literally just for standing adjacent to protests.",35,,
153,0.97,839.872,843.609,I had a rib broken and there's no justice for me.,35,,
154,0.97,843.609,844.643,Opa is completely Unhelpful.,35,,
155,0.97,844.643,851.984,"I can't even get body camera footage for another six months, I believe.",35,,
156,0.97,851.984,859.758,"There's no reason that we need to keep pouring money, any amount of money into this violent oppression machine.",35,,
157,0.97,859.758,863.429,"So again, Defund SPD, at least 50%.",35,,
158,0.97,863.429,872.338,"I personally think we should go 80 and put that money directly into black communities, Brown communities and indigenous communities in Seattle.",35,,
159,0.97,872.338,874.64,Take care of the people who need it.,35,,
160,0.97,874.64,875.608,Thank you so very much.,35,,
161,0.97,875.608,879.979,Thank you for your time and for telling us about that experience.,36,,

164,0.97,882.014,896.795,The last two people that I see are still listed as not present so I'm going to do one more call and double check with our folks from the I.T.,36,,

181,0.97,968.167,969.702,"Chief Diaz, it's good to have you with us.",38,,
182,0.97,969.702,984.083,This is maybe one of the first times we've had the chance to hear from you directly at the table in this role that you have presented to city council a number of times in the past.,38,,
183,0.97,984.083,987.953,I've appreciated the candor in which you've come to the table.,38,,
184,0.97,987.953,993.892,Again your comments made upon your chief appointment day.,38,,
185,0.97,993.892,1002.801,Those are important statements you made.,38,,
186,0.97,1002.801,1005.104,A helpful conversation we are hearing across the country.,38,,
187,0.97,1005.104,1011.51,I just want to say thank you for your time today and for your willingness to always be at the table.,38,,
188,0.97,1011.51,1014.546,We look forward to taking you up on that offer.,38,,
189,0.97,1014.546,1027.459,We do have all morning dedicated to this and I have some opening comments and then I'm going to turn it over to the chair of public safety Council member Herbold for comments and then to welcome chief Diaz and the team.,38,,
190,0.97,1027.459,1038.27,"Colleagus, as we enter into the budget season we know every budget season is a chance for us to really focus on one or two focal points and this year the obvious focal point is around public safety.",38,,
191,0.97,1038.27,1040.172,This is going to require big changes.,38,,
192,0.97,1040.172,1051.817,There's big needs in our community that have gone unmet for years and this requires big thinking through a collaborative lens to try to move forward large changes that are not comfortable to many.,38,,
193,0.97,1051.817,1065.798,But this is what we've been called upon to do as elected leaders to make decisions in our community that are sometimes uncomfortable and frankly when we stood up and have run for office many of us said we're going into office to shake up the status quo.,38,,
194,0.97,1065.798,1081.18,I'm really proud of the conversations we've had so far and I know that many of us continue to get feedback about the need for there to be more robust conversations but there also to be more change as we've heard from folks who testified this morning and over the summer.,38,,
195,0.97,1081.18,1086.418,I think the biggest questions we have are how do we keep residents safe.,38,,
196,0.97,1086.418,1086.785,All residents.,38,,
197,0.97,1086.785,1097.529,That includes folks in our city who have raised concerns about our very own police Department and wanting to make sure everyone in the community feels safe and that 911 is the number to call.,38,,
198,0.97,1097.529,1107.706,"And when somebody shows up they truly have public safety in mind for those who are both being, making the call and those who are receiving the services.",38,,
199,0.97,1107.706,1113.846,"You know, I think as we hear more stories from across the country Seattle's not in a unique position.",38,,
200,0.97,1113.846,1116.849,If anybody was up listening to NPR last night at 9:00 P.M.,38,,
201,0.97,1116.849,1122.187,There was an entire hour dedicated to the changes that are being called upon across the country.,38,,
202,0.97,1122.187,1128.126,"If you haven't had a chance to listen to that, I'll post some of those stories later today.",38,,
203,0.97,1128.126,1136.935,"Npr was doing really great reporting on everything from Camden, New Jersey to what's happening in cities across the country right now.",38,,
204,0.97,1136.935,1143.075,"Questions people are asking is when you have someone blocking your driveway, why is it that wear told to call 911.",38,,
205,0.97,1143.075,1150.549,"When you have a Memberral health breakdown, the answer shouldn't be to call 911.",38,,
206,0.97,1150.549,1158.156,I think our Council colleagues have done a better job at Articulating.,38,,
207,0.97,1158.156,1163.328,Many of them have told me they don't want to be the social worker or the mental health counselor.,38,,
208,0.97,1163.328,1169.001,"Many of them are asking why they're being, why they are the answer to our broken safety net.",38,,
209,0.97,1169.001,1176.341,We need to rethink what it means to invest in a safety net and create the stability many of you folk about yesterday.,38,,
210,0.97,1176.341,1178.944,I look forward to having this conversation today.,38,,
211,0.97,1178.944,1185.284,"I think it is our opportunity to take some big steps, to gather the big thinking we began this summer.",38,,
212,0.97,1185.284,1195.294,To examine the right place for services for our police Department and it's important for us to really continue to hear the call from folks who are taking to the street.,38,,
213,0.97,1195.294,1198.53,The global we've of protests are happening.,38,,
214,0.97,1198.53,1204.269,Are happening across the country and across the globe.,38,,
215,0.97,1204.269,1213.545,Specifically from our black residents who are calling for black lives to matter not just in Murals on the street but in policy and practice.,38,,
216,0.97,1213.545,1218.951,I'll turn it over to Council member Herbold who has been a steward of our public safety committee.,38,,
217,0.97,1218.951,1223.956,I just want to thank all of you in advance for your time.,38,,
218,0.97,1223.956,1243.342,"These are tough conversations and again, thanks to the folks at SPD, especially chief Diaz for your willingness to come to the table and to share with us the 2021 proposed budgets and allow for us to ask some questions about Visioning and working with you to get to the reductions that make sense for our community.",38,,
219,0.97,1243.342,1248.413,"Council member Herbold, thank you for taking over and for introducing chief Diaz.",38,,
220,0.97,1248.413,1249.548,Thank you so much.,39,,
221,0.97,1249.548,1262.594,I want to just start off by again thanking chief Diaz both for being with us here today and also for joining me in my district 1 town hall last night.,39,,
222,0.97,1262.594,1276.375,I don't want to steal his thunder but I really appreciate that the SPD budget principles are framed in the principles that he has authored.,39,,
223,0.97,1276.375,1282.314,And has taken to heart and we'll hear more about them in a moment.,39,,
224,0.97,1282.314,1293.325,As we know across the nation growing the size of our police departments has historically been sort of a third rail politics.,39,,
225,0.97,1293.325,1305.47,We never question whether adding and growing the size of our police Department actually increases safety because we in government assume it does.,39,,
226,0.97,1305.47,1315.714,"Spd's budget has increased every year since 2000, even during the grand recession when overall the city budget went down.",39,,
227,0.97,1315.714,1328.493,In the four years I've been in office the SPD budget has increased dramatically from 299 million in 2016 to the adopted budget of $409 million in 2020.,39,,
228,0.97,1328.493,1334.132,That's an increase of more than $110 million in four years.,39,,
229,0.97,1334.132,1347.546,"I've supported these budget increases, but we're hearing from many in our community and in communities across the nation that a larger Department does not necessarily equal more public safety.",39,,
230,0.97,1347.546,1349.881,And that we must incorporate other approaches.,39,,
231,0.97,1349.881,1354.453,Approaches that are being practiced in other cities.,39,,
232,0.97,1354.453,1357.322,Sometimes they can lead to better public safety outcomes.,39,,
233,0.97,1357.322,1358.39,More people at the table.,39,,
234,0.97,1358.39,1374.506,People who have not been at the table before have made me Re- examine my own assumptions and my support of old ways of doing things and I'm really grateful for that.,39,,
235,0.97,1374.506,1377.008,I continue to support funding for public safety.,39,,
236,0.97,1377.008,1379.244,It should be not only the police.,39,,
237,0.97,1379.244,1387.285,Too often we ask the police to do too much and they are ill equipped to handle many of the issues that we ask them to address.,39,,
238,0.97,1387.285,1393.258,What does that have to do with the police Department budget?,39,,
239,0.97,1393.258,1406.505,Many of the things we want to be able to do more of in an atmosphere of limited resources means we have to reinvest our traditional public safety investments.,39,,
240,0.97,1406.505,1417.649,A review of 911 calls began the process of identifying what work currently done by police might be best done by other types of professionals.,39,,
241,0.97,1417.649,1422.187,"In 2019, 56% of dispatched calls were noncriminal.",39,,
242,0.97,1422.187,1437.369,It's past time we work to resolve these problems up stream so we don't have to invest so heavily in a police force that's unable to address all the issues we've asked them to use policing to address.,39,,
243,0.97,1437.369,1449.948,Just want to high light the plan as identified in the Council resolution we passed this summer.,39,,
244,0.97,1449.948,1460.425,We proposed that we work to fund an effort to advise on the creation of a new civilian led Department of community safety and violation prevention.,39,,
245,0.97,1460.425,1470.368,As it relates to the Community- led research and Participatory budgeting effort.,39,,
246,0.97,1470.368,1472.37,We talked about that yesterday.,39,,
247,0.97,1472.37,1486.351,Really appreciate my colleague's thoughts about that process and the need to pull our community together in it advising us rather than creating two separate processes.,39,,
248,0.97,1486.351,1496.428,As it relates to the creation of a new civilian led Department I think the Mayor's proposed budget has a new Department.,39,,
249,0.97,1496.428,1499.564,Might be called something different.,39,,
250,0.97,1499.564,1509.341,It's consistent with our interest in creating a new Department where we would transfer some departments out of SPD.,39,,
251,0.97,1509.341,1514.012,Our resolution identified as departments to transfer out of SPD.,39,,
252,0.97,1514.012,1516.915,"911, office of emergency management and parking enforcement.",39,,
253,0.97,1516.915,1527.425,"Again, I really appreciate that the Mayor's proposed budget has a new Department consistent with this plan and transfers these functions.",39,,
254,0.97,1527.425,1531.863,We've requested that the chief pursue some out of order layoffs.,39,,
255,0.97,1531.863,1540.972,Prioritizing officers for layoff with the most sustained complaints against them while maintaining adequate patrol staffing in each district.,39,,
256,0.97,1540.972,1548.747,Appreciate receiving the letter from the deputy around that process.,39,,
257,0.97,1548.747,1568.833,Other parts of our plan include work to Reprioritize 911 calls for response and discontinuing bias policing practices that have harmed Bipoc communities and establishing a publicly accessible Registry for police misconduct.,39,,
258,0.97,1568.833,1572.37,Including whether a complaint used use of force or racial profiling.,39,,
259,0.97,1572.37,1584.082,We clarify the days of the Council Reto actively approving Overspent budgets and overtime are over.,39,,
260,0.97,1584.082,1596.561,We identified our desire and need to collaborate in realizing what I think is mostly despite a lot of the back and forth mostly a shared vision.,39,,
261,0.97,1596.561,1605.804,It's how we begin to shift the conversation in our lens away from police being the responsibility to respond to all of these issues.,39,,
262,0.97,1605.804,1625.624,Want to also flag we talked yesterday about the fact that our budget action of the summer requested a report back from SPD by September 30th to identify which additional functions of SPD could be fully Civilianized.,39,,
263,0.97,1625.624,1636.868,We learned from director noble yesterday that we were unlikely to receive that in time for the beginning of our budget discussions.,39,,
264,0.97,1636.868,1643.308,I think we should work to try to answer some of those questions during budget.,39,,
265,0.97,1643.308,1647.278,Appreciate that we just this morning received an executive order from it the Mayor.,39,,
266,0.97,1647.278,1653.518,Haven't had a chance to review it fully.,39,,
267,0.97,1653.518,1665.797,But really want to look to see how this process impacts our interests in moving on more realignment of the police Department budget during this budget process.,39,,
268,0.97,1665.797,1670.201,I do not want to delay change even further.,39,,
269,0.97,1670.201,1680.178,And I want to really best take advantage of not only our experts within city government but our experts outside of city government.,39,,
270,0.97,1680.178,1689.688,"And so with that, look forward to hearing more from the chief about the proposed 2021 budget.",39,,
271,0.97,1689.688,1694.192,Thank you very much Council member Herbold.,40,,
272,0.97,1694.192,1694.492,Chief Diaz.,40,,
273,0.97,1694.492,1702.567,Thank you and your team for being here.,40,,
274,0.97,1702.567,1702.934,Thank you.,41,,
275,0.97,1702.934,1711.609,I also heard a cat that was also in the background so glad to have the cat listen to me as well.,41,,
276,0.97,1711.609,1718.483,But thank you for giving me the opportunity to brief you on the Mayor and my vision for the Seattle police Department in 2021.,41,,
277,0.97,1718.483,1729.761,We deliver this presentation knowing that later today during the community safety presentation much more detail will be provided about the work to be done on Reimagining public safety.,41,,
278,0.97,1729.761,1734.199,Right now we specifically will be addressing the on going work of the Seattle police Department.,41,,
279,0.97,1734.199,1744.642,As the chief of police I've Tasked my command staff and entire Department with five areas of work to focus on.,41,,
280,0.97,1744.642,1748.079,Right now and throughout 2021.,41,,
281,0.97,1748.079,1748.88,Reenvisioning application policing.,41,,
282,0.97,1748.88,1758.857,I've committed SPD to engage in the process of designing the Rle of Department should play in community safety.,41,,
283,0.97,1758.857,1759.09,Second.,41,,
284,0.97,1759.09,1764.095,Hhumanization.,41,,
285,0.97,1764.095,1765.296,"Third, reinventing community engagement.",41,,
286,0.97,1765.296,1767.632,In the midst of Covid it has changed our world.,41,,
287,0.97,1767.632,1782.881,I expect that in the next week and months we will begin the hard work of ensuring the Department is devoted to establishing true and lasting relationships throughout respectful interactions.,41,,
288,0.97,1782.881,1784.082,"Four, fiscal stewardship.",41,,
289,0.97,1784.082,1788.62,Spd will examine every expenditure to guarantee its meaningful contributions to community safety.,41,,
290,0.97,1788.62,1790.522,"Number five, employee wellness and morale.",41,,
291,0.97,1790.522,1794.259,It's essential that the Department retains the best employees.,41,,
292,0.97,1794.259,1798.53,Without them we cannot provide exceptional police services.,41,,
293,0.97,1798.53,1809.14,"It is my firm belief that if the Department fully embraces this work, we will succeed in restoring the trust that's been diminished with some of our community.",41,,
294,0.97,1809.14,1814.412,This morning the team will outline the Mayor's proposed budget actions for 2021.,41,,
295,0.97,1814.412,1821.386,These actions highlight the focus areas of SPD and chart the initial path for the work we all are about to undertake.,41,,
296,0.97,1821.386,1831.896,"But before we get into specifics, I want to provide you with a general overview of where we stand and where I want SPD to go in 2021.",41,,
297,0.97,1831.896,1839.237,Yesterday marked the first full day of additional resources moving back into the patrol Bureau.,41,,
298,0.97,1839.237,1839.938,Specifically to 911 response.,41,,
299,0.97,1839.938,1849.113,"As I've outlined, a specific part of my plan to ensure we can support community safety for everyone in the midst of an economic crisis is to focus on our core mission.",41,,
300,0.97,1849.113,1854.118,Responding to calls for help and preventing crime.,41,,
301,0.97,1854.118,1857.822,"Each year approximately 800,000 calls come in to Seattle 911 center.",41,,
302,0.97,1857.822,1869.601,"Spd officers are dispatched to some 270,000 unique events and they see and engage in some 173,000 more during what we call on use.",41,,
303,0.97,1869.601,1873.371,"That is over 440,000 incidents where SPD engages the public.",41,,
304,0.97,1873.371,1878.776,Almost all of this initial work is done by the officers in patrol.,41,,
305,0.97,1878.776,1891.222,"Before I initiated this Reassignment of patrol officers, patrol had the same number of officers responding that it had 8 years ago.",41,,
306,0.97,1891.222,1896.027,Today we have the same number of officers responding to 911 calls.,41,,
307,0.97,1896.027,1897.495,How did we get here?,41,,
308,0.97,1897.495,1899.063,Special needs pop up.,41,,
309,0.97,1899.063,1901.733,New types of crime.,41,,
310,0.97,1901.733,1902.233,New community needs.,41,,
311,0.97,1902.233,1902.7,New best practices.,41,,
312,0.97,1902.7,1912.944,"And since patrol is where most officers are always are, those new positions were generally filled by pulling from patrol.",41,,
313,0.97,1912.944,1918.549,Today the Department only has about 25 more officers than it had in 2010.,41,,
314,0.97,1918.549,1927.692,It's an interesting point since the inception of the consent decree we've created 58 sworn positions to support that work.,41,,
315,0.97,1927.692,1931.496,Along with additional civilian positions.,41,,
316,0.97,1931.496,1941.773,"Functionally while the positions are essential, on the street it means we're the same size we were eight year ago.",41,,
317,0.97,1941.773,1948.746,"With increases of employees on leave, we have 35 fewer officers in service today than we did in 2010.",41,,
318,0.97,1948.746,1950.548,I do not think it's okay.,41,,
319,0.97,1950.548,1966.297,I do not think the cities should use a per capita analysis to decide how many officers they need on the street because every city is different and geography and crime and the style of policing but it is a metric that lets you know if you're in the right ballpark.,41,,
320,0.97,1966.297,1979.911,"When I looked at the data report to the FBI and see that we rank 22nd out of the 25 largest cities in the ratio of officers to population, it only CONFIRMS what I hear from officers in patrol.",41,,
321,0.97,1979.911,1980.411,They're stretched thin.,41,,
322,0.97,1980.411,1981.98,They're racing from call to call.,41,,
323,0.97,1981.98,1985.65,"They have, they're having to work extra shifts to ensure their colleagues are safe.",41,,
324,0.97,1985.65,1992.89,They don't have the time to address persistent issues and get to know their neighbors they're serving.,41,,
325,0.97,1992.89,1997.195,"Last year officers and detectives took over 1,200 guns off the street.",41,,
326,0.97,1997.195,2004.068,This year through August they've taken another 717 guns off the street.,41,,
327,0.97,2004.068,2009.374,Recovered over 2000 Shell they casings.,41,,
328,0.97,2009.374,2014.746,So far patrol officers have responded to 37 Homicide crime scenes involving 40 victims.,41,,
329,0.97,2014.746,2018.683,They've gone to over 315 shots fire instances.,41,,
330,0.97,2018.683,2022.687,197 sexual assault and rape cases.,41,,
331,0.97,2022.687,2024.689,Over 1000 robberies.,41,,
332,0.97,2024.689,2026.057,Over 2000 aggravated assaults.,41,,
333,0.97,2026.057,2033.364,And with a recent huge Uptick they've gone to over 120 arson incidents.,41,,
334,0.97,2033.364,2037.435,"In K to these crimes officers have helped over 20,000 victims of major crime.",41,,
335,0.97,2037.435,2041.372,"About 10,000 of which are women.",41,,
336,0.97,2041.372,2048.88,After hearing Chiefs during almost my entire career say that patrol was a backbone of the Department I decided to back those words up with action.,41,,
337,0.97,2048.88,2052.417,"Not because it sounded good, because it makes sense when you look at the numbers.",41,,
338,0.97,2052.417,2063.361,When you examine five years of survey work by Seattle University and over 14 years of direct survey following up with those callers who had officers dispatched to them you see a clear message.,41,,
339,0.97,2063.361,2068.232,When the people of the city call 911 for help they want an officer to respond quickly.,41,,
340,0.97,2068.232,2072.303,And when they do they're happy with the response they get from that officer.,41,,
341,0.97,2072.303,2090.688,If the amazing officers of the SPD can achieve that sort of customer service when they're stretched thin I want to see what the type of topnotch public safety services with E can deliver when they have the time to address the real issues.,41,,
342,0.97,2090.688,2097.094,Some have concerns about what it means to not have the formal community policing team or to have fewer detectives in certain units.,41,,
343,0.97,2097.094,2100.465,This goes back to the same issue.,41,,
344,0.97,2100.465,2112.944,"We've had an over specialization for too long we followed the model of creating a specialized unit to address every new issue or need again and creating a model where our 911 responders were only that the officers, were only that.",41,,
345,0.97,2112.944,2116.914,Officers who could answer calls and move on.,41,,
346,0.97,2116.914,2125.79,It is my vision that pushing everyone in the Department to more of a generalist model we will be better to meet the needs of each and every incident.,41,,
347,0.97,2125.79,2128.059,The CBT officers will be on patrol.,41,,
348,0.97,2128.059,2135.6,They'll show the other officers what they've learned and how they can actually do more problem solving.,41,,
349,0.97,2135.6,2138.769,They'll show from our detectives going back into patrol.,41,,
350,0.97,2138.769,2144.942,They'll be able to acquire better skills to meet the demands or the needs for prosecution.,41,,
351,0.97,2144.942,2150.715,"As we do with everything, we will monitor how this, how this new approach works.",41,,
352,0.97,2150.715,2152.183,We will watch case loads.,41,,
353,0.97,2152.183,2154.652,We will watch response times.,41,,
354,0.97,2154.652,2155.853,We will watch clearance rates.,41,,
355,0.97,2155.853,2163.995,I hope this move alone makes it clear I'm prepared to make changes and when the need is clear there is a plan for what to do next.,41,,
356,0.97,2163.995,2167.131,We will commit to evaluate how that works.,41,,
357,0.97,2167.131,2177.008,"With the new challenges we are facing economic short falls, staffing constraints, increases in shots fired and Homicides we need more officers on the street.",41,,
358,0.97,2177.008,2180.678,We need more officers investigating these incidents.,41,,
359,0.97,2180.678,2186.751,I know it seems like a different time but it was this January we had a mass shooting at 3RD and pine.,41,,
360,0.97,2186.751,2193.524,Almost everyone in the city wanted more police in that challenging area.,41,,
361,0.97,2193.524,2193.758,We did.,41,,
362,0.97,2193.758,2197.428,"We increased officers presence at a cost of about $418,000.",41,,
363,0.97,2197.428,2200.398,Right up until things shut down under the pandemic.,41,,
364,0.97,2200.398,2211.375,I say that this illustrates that the calls will come from across the city to see more officers in specific locations.,41,,
365,0.97,2211.375,2212.243,They come every year.,41,,
366,0.97,2212.243,2217.181,Extreme incidences like the 3RD and pine shooting and more money date.,41,,
367,0.97,2217.181,2222.053,We're asked to put officers out on Alki to address racing and Partying.,41,,
368,0.97,2222.053,2227.058,We're asked to have more officers to address drug dealing and general disorder.,41,,
369,0.97,2227.058,2233.831,Almost every year we're asked to do more along Rainier and other areas as they experience an unacceptable level of gun violence.,41,,
370,0.97,2233.831,2251.282,"In recent years we've been asked to put more officers out at Pioneer square to address growing Encampments, drug dealing and consistent Harassment and assault of employees going to and from work by people in crisis.",41,,
371,0.97,2251.282,2261.158,Just last week we were asked to do more in the central district as residents confronted an intolerable increase in it gun violence.,41,,
372,0.97,2261.158,2261.759,I say just last year.,41,,
373,0.97,2261.759,2271.035,Almost every year we are asked to do more along Aurora Avenue North adds violence ebbs and flows and women and children are trafficked and victimized.,41,,
374,0.97,2271.035,2273.704,I want to always be able to respond to these calls for help.,41,,
375,0.97,2273.704,2280.778,I want the Department to be able to be part of the solution and to the underlying issues that drive the crime and disorder.,41,,
376,0.97,2280.778,2292.59,But responding to these calls to those issues means that I have to have officers necessary to handle the calls for service and to have that time to do the problem solving and community building work.,41,,
377,0.97,2292.59,2297.461,I fully support the proposals in the presentation we're about to go through.,41,,
378,0.97,2297.461,2302.633,There does need to be a significant investment in communities of color.,41,,
379,0.97,2302.633,2308.439,There are centuries of racism and injustice across our society that must be repaired.,41,,
380,0.97,2308.439,2313.844,There are several major functions that can exist outside of the police Department's budget.,41,,
381,0.97,2313.844,2327.725,"Additionally, as outlined in the executive order I do believe the critical analysis of the calls we can respond to, that we can identify some specific incidences that can be safely addressed by other alternatives when they're developed.",41,,
382,0.97,2327.725,2333.464,I also have to be clear I do not have enough officers right now to handle the work we're asked to do.,41,,
383,0.97,2333.464,2336.901,The call analysis will identify some of the work that can be shifted.,41,,
384,0.97,2336.901,2345.409,"The alternative resources to handle those calls will not be there January 1, 2021 and they won't be there December 31, 2021.",41,,
385,0.97,2345.409,2347.411,We have to bridge the difference.,41,,
386,0.97,2347.411,2356.353,"This budget recognizes I can push the Department to do more with less, that we can release the positions next year that are highly unlikely to be filled.",41,,
387,0.97,2356.353,2362.593,"I would love to have all the officers, there's work for all of them to do.",41,,
388,0.97,2362.593,2366.097,There are problems that they could help solve.,41,,
389,0.97,2366.097,2374.638,"While I love to have them, what I have to have is the ability to hire to stay as close to 1400 as possible.",41,,
390,0.97,2374.638,2382.546,"Each drop below that will mean either slower response times, larger case loads or types of crimes we can no longer respond to.",41,,
391,0.97,2382.546,2390.688,These issues will snowball if the hire freeze initiated in it response to Covid-19 driven by economic continues into 2021.,41,,
392,0.97,2390.688,2398.028,It would take us years to bring us back up to current levels where we're stretched to handle our core mission.,41,,
393,0.97,2398.028,2403.534,I will turn it over to directive director Angela Socci.,41,,
394,0.97,2403.534,2404.935,Chief Diaz.,42,,
395,0.97,2404.935,2406.971,Thank you for your time.,42,,
396,0.97,2406.971,2407.405,"Angela, I'm sorry.",42,,
397,0.97,2407.405,2416.28,I think there's a number of things that were said in opening comments that people probably have questions about.,42,,
398,0.97,2416.28,2420.818,I'm going to take a pause to see if there's questions.,42,,
399,0.97,2420.818,2421.385,I'm going to start here.,42,,
400,0.97,2421.385,2437.067,What I think I heard you say is you needed to have 1400 officers and there's not the ability to have less or there's not a willingness to entertain the concept of having less than 1400.,42,,
401,0.97,2437.067,2446.544,I think that does not Jibe with the conversation we just had about how we can reduce the type of work that officers are currently being asked to respond to.,42,,
402,0.97,2446.544,2452.783,You mention that you have a concern that there's not going to be enough people out there to respond to the calls.,42,,
403,0.97,2452.783,2465.896,"The premise of the earlier comments made and this summer's conversation is trying to reduce the type of calls that sworn officers, those with guns are needing to respond to.",42,,
404,0.97,2465.896,2484.381,"So if it we are effectively transferring those calls that should be going to mental health providers, case managers, folks who are responding to situations where you don't need a gun, it would inherently mean that the size of the force would not necessarily have to be the same.",42,,
405,0.97,2484.381,2489.92,We're talking about people who are having minor fender Benders have to have SPD called.,42,,
406,0.97,2489.92,2493.557,We're talking about sworn officers with guns on them directing traffic.,42,,
407,0.97,2493.557,2500.03,We're talking about people who are showing up when as I mentioned somebody is blocking their driveway.,42,,
408,0.97,2500.03,2521.619,This is not the type of calls that we would want our officers to have to respond to and so for effectively having a conversation about transferring those type of calls into another area is there not a willingness to recognize that the type of sworn officers with guns that number could inherently go down?,42,,
409,0.97,2521.619,2536.767,And I think once we actually present how that gets analyzed in this part of a deeper functional analysis that we also have to do over the next several months to understand the workload and capacity and patrol is very easy.,43,,
410,0.97,2536.767,2544.074,Chris Fisher will be able to articulate this later in the presentation.,43,,
411,0.97,2544.074,2545.709,About certain levels of staffing.,43,,
412,0.97,2545.709,2566.363,"I think as we talk about moving and shifting some of those calls for service as I kind of highlighted at the very beginning we are already, we were already short staffed as a police agency for many years, already seeing numbers under our 2010 staffing levels.",43,,
413,0.97,2566.363,2570.467,That's 10 years ago with the city has considerably grown.,43,,
414,0.97,2570.467,2585.983,"We can remove those certain calls for service as we kind of get into those investments into our Bipoc communities or even into mental health or homelessness and those can still go, those can still take into effect.",43,,
415,0.97,2585.983,2590.087,I also know based on certain calls for service that we're still paneling.,43,,
416,0.97,2590.087,2593.724,We have to have a certain amount of officers to be able to do that.,43,,
417,0.97,2593.724,2595.726,Right now we're struggling to do that.,43,,
418,0.97,2595.726,2601.732,We will continue to struggle if we see a smaller sized Department.,43,,
419,0.97,2601.732,2608.806,"Council member Herbold, just want to turn to you first to see if you have any questions as a follow up.",44,,
420,0.97,2608.806,2611.608,"Sorry, council member.",44,,
421,0.97,2611.608,2615.012,I think you're on mute still.,44,,
422,0.97,2615.012,2615.479,Thank you.,45,,
423,0.97,2615.479,2624.154,"I think, you know, I hear what chief Diaz is saying.",45,,
424,0.97,2624.154,2624.822,I appreciate the perspective.,45,,
425,0.97,2624.822,2650.28,"I' E heard it myself for years that officers are literally going from call to call to call and I, I hear the chief saying that he needs more capacity so that officers aren't stretched so thin.",45,,
426,0.97,2650.28,2655.586,I appreciate that he is shifting officers from specialty units to patrol in order to address that.,45,,
427,0.97,2655.586,2679.81,"The part where I feel, and I appreciate the chief acknowledges that another way to address these capacity issues is by reducing the types of calls that officers, patrol officers respond to.",45,,
428,0.97,2679.81,2689.453,And supporting an infrastructure to work with other professionals to answer some of those calls.,45,,
429,0.97,2689.453,2695.626,I think we are identifying a similar issue.,45,,
430,0.97,2695.626,2714.278,"We are perhaps each focusing on, more on--and I think we also recognize that in identifying that a shared issue we are both recognizing that there are different ways to address the issue.",45,,
431,0.97,2714.278,2716.613,One way is to increase the number of officers.,45,,
432,0.97,2716.613,2722.619,Another way is to reduce the types of calls that officers.,45,,
433,0.97,2722.619,2728.459,I hear chief Diaz acknowledging that.,45,,
434,0.97,2728.459,2739.303,But what I'm concerned about is the time it's going to take for the chief's estimation in order to begin to make that shift.,45,,
435,0.97,2739.303,2759.89,I know a lot of the things the Mayor is talking about wanting to do through her Idt and the executive order we're hoping to actually be able to start to put our arms around in the next couple months of the budget process.,45,,
436,0.97,2759.89,2765.329,That was the thinking behind some of the summer budgeting investments.,45,,
437,0.97,2765.329,2787.217,The $10 million is supposed to build capacity among organizations that have the expertise and engaging with populations of people that often are associated with 911 calls that the police Department doesn't need to answer those calls.,45,,
438,0.97,2787.217,2798.629,"The idea in the 2020 budgeting is to invest in building the capacity of those organizations, of those professionals now is that we could begin the shift for 2021.",45,,
439,0.97,2798.629,2806.603,So I'm hearing a lot of agreement about the goals.,45,,
440,0.97,2806.603,2808.205,The identification around the challenges.,45,,
441,0.97,2808.205,2813.343,Where I'm hearing the most Disconnect is on timing and schedule.,45,,
442,0.97,2813.343,2815.646,I just leave it at that for now.,45,,
443,0.97,2815.646,2834.798,"If I can add, you know, just so people know our plan, we did talk about, I was giving the floor of 1400 but this is about 100 officers less than we had budgeted last year.",46,,
444,0.97,2834.798,2837.167,It I think it was 1497 budgeted last year.,46,,
445,0.97,2837.167,2841.672,Not saying we're not looking at being smaller.,46,,
446,0.97,2841.672,2850.547,"I'm looking at what, you know, we're having to respond to and trying to deal with those response levels in the near future.",46,,
447,0.97,2850.547,2853.717,It's not that I'm not looking at a smaller Department.,46,,
448,0.97,2853.717,2858.722,I think that we've already been able to establish.,46,,
449,0.97,2858.722,2879.576,It is really what that size is and what that for me that staffing minimum level is.,46,,
450,0.97,2879.576,2881.111,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",47,,
451,0.97,2881.111,2883.547,Thank you interim chief Diaz for being with us this morning.,47,,
452,0.97,2883.547,2900.931,Just want to talk about some of the comments you made related to the staffing model as I think it'll be helpful as we dig into the substance of the presentation Angela is going to be digging into shortly.,47,,
453,0.97,2900.931,2904.301,Just want to dig into some of the assumptions I'm hearing you make.,47,,
454,0.97,2904.301,2929.626,In one of your comments you said we should not use a per capita staffing model but then you Referenced an FBI study and I want to confirm the FBI study you're confirming where you indicated Seattle ranks 22 out of 25 is using a per capita staffing model.,47,,
455,0.97,2929.626,2932.362,Is that correct?,47,,
456,0.97,2932.362,2934.431,Correct.,48,,
457,0.97,2934.431,2956.453,"Really quickly, can you tell me if you don't believe that a per capita approach should be used at the city of Seattle for staffing minimum proposals, what is the model you believe, Whatted is model that the police Department currently uses in determining the approach to staffing needs.",49,,
458,0.97,2956.453,2965.529,I think what we're hopefully focused on is really developing that functional analysis for every level of our Department.,50,,
459,0.97,2965.529,2989.419,"We already know certain areas when it comes to patrol and I think Chris Fisher will be able to articulate certain Metrics out of staffing patrol staffing as well as shift staffing because right now we are on a 4- 2 schedule and Optimally we would want to, if it we're looking at employee wellness we would look to a 4-3 shift.",50,,
460,0.97,2989.419,3001.798,Then what does that minimum staffing require for patrol.,50,,
461,0.97,3001.798,3004.034,Dr. Fisher can talk about that.,50,,
462,0.97,3004.034,3011.208,"It's taking an analysis of our Department and understanding what staffing looks like when it comes to each and every detective unit, our S.W.A.T.",50,,
463,0.97,3011.208,3014.444,"Team, our special operations groups and our patrol as well.",50,,
464,0.97,3014.444,3017.981,We've done some of that initial work already on the front end.,50,,
465,0.97,3017.981,3025.622,But that is also work that we would want to work with other partners and looking at over the next several months.,50,,
466,0.97,3025.622,3030.293,So when you say functional analysis what does that mean?,51,,
467,0.97,3030.293,3044.341,"So if you look at a detective unit it's looking at exactly case loads, clearance rates, how big does a detective have when it comes to certain case loads.",52,,
468,0.97,3044.341,3060.824,"So if it you look at say domestic Violenc where we know, you know who the victim is, you might have a bigger Úcaseload for domestic violence because you already know the person that might have caused the harm.",52,,
469,0.97,3060.824,3067.597,"And a sexual assault case, it might be completely different because you don't know the suspect in that case.",52,,
470,0.97,3067.597,3097.828,"So we would have to analyze each and every detective position, burglary is another one when it comes to traffic collision investigations we've seen more Callouts for Tcis than we have in previous years because when Covid hit us we had more people going on the roadways and speeding down and, which resulted in more vehicular deaths.",52,,
471,0.97,3097.828,3105.268,So right now we would have to analyze each and every different detective unit throughout the Department.,52,,
472,0.97,3105.268,3113.844,So when you say functional analysis you're literally taking a Widget perspective?,53,,
473,0.97,3113.844,3125.322,"Number of cases assigned per officer, based on each division and it's just at this point about the number of cases and the volume of cases?",53,,
474,0.97,3125.322,3129.493,That's what you mean when you say functional analysis?,53,,
475,0.97,3129.493,3129.86,Yeah.,54,,
476,0.97,3129.86,3136.933,There's certain things that there are already best practices across the country when it comes to certain special operational units.,54,,
477,0.97,3136.933,3155.418,"So you would take some of those Metrics and say does Seattle have the ability to respond to this many Callouts for service when it comes to say a specific, you know, traffic collision investigations or S.W.A.T.",54,,
478,0.97,3155.418,3167.797,"Or, so there are certain Metrics that are already best practices throughout the country and are we meeting those best practices or are we not and do we need to make adjustments accordingly.",54,,
479,0.97,3167.797,3168.098,Right.,55,,
480,0.97,3168.098,3187.717,So what I'm getting at is that from your perspective the police staffing and allocation recommendations that we have before us are primarily being fueled and informed by officer workload.,55,,
481,0.97,3187.717,3215.245,"For right now, yes, that is what we're . cops office staffing and allocation.",56,,
482,0.97,3215.245,3219.649,I just want to go get.,56,,
483,0.97,3219.649,3223.687,Understanding from you about this particular issue.,56,,
484,0.97,3223.687,3242.205,"This article talks about how there are different approaches to determining staffing needs and it says quote, we found agencies typically take one of four approaches to determining staffing needs per capita, minimum staffing, authorized level or workload.",56,,
485,0.97,3242.205,3251.748,"It goes on to talking about how these issues, these different staffing models are flawed in ways.",56,,
486,0.97,3251.748,3263.693,"And of course looks at the steps of the Workload-Based assessment which are fundamentally rooted in examining the distribution of calls for service hour, day and month.",56,,
487,0.97,3263.693,3267.163,Estimating time consumed on calls for service.,56,,
488,0.97,3267.163,3270.467,Calculating an agency's shift relief factor.,56,,
489,0.97,3270.467,3275.071,Establishing performance objectives and provide staffing estimates.,56,,
490,0.97,3275.071,3296.526,"There are, however, alternative delivery systems to figuring out how to set these staffing models and I want to be really clear that the staffing models that are being baked into the assumptions for this particular budget are really fundamentally about officer workload.",56,,
491,0.97,3296.526,3296.76,Yes.,57,,
492,0.97,3296.76,3305.769,And Dr. Fisher will be able and I know executive director Angela Socci will be able to cover some of that more in depth.,57,,
493,0.97,3305.769,3318.448,"But yes, that's where you start to then look into the officer workload to understand do we have adequate staffing to address that workload.",57,,
494,0.97,3318.448,3333.663,"And again, this, this organization that that is part of the U.S. Department of justice talks about the staffing landscape and it says the following, from a long term perspective police agencies face a threefold challenge in meeting their staffing needs.",58,,
495,0.97,3333.663,3344.207,"A decreasing number of qualified applicants, expanding attrition and a broadening scope of police work.",58,,
496,0.97,3344.207,3351.281,Do you agree with those particular long term perspectives as articulated by the U.S. Department of justice?,58,,
497,0.97,3351.281,3351.548,Yeah.,59,,
498,0.97,3351.548,3360.99,As I noted already there are things we are looking at at trying to remove off our plate.,59,,
499,0.97,3360.99,3361.291,So to say.,59,,
500,0.97,3361.291,3366.863,So you know that is one part of that shift.,59,,
501,0.97,3366.863,3375.805,"Is there stuff that the police Department shouldn't necessarily respond to and that's, you know, what I've, one of the things I've highlighted already.",59,,
502,0.97,3375.805,3380.477,"I think some of those areas are, those cops office.",59,,
503,0.97,3380.477,3386.015,I actually wrote a couple publication on community policing.,59,,
504,0.97,3386.015,3392.288,I'm very familiar with subject matter experts being able to articulate some of the best practices.,59,,
505,0.97,3392.288,3393.456,"I think, and I appreciate that.",60,,
506,0.97,3393.456,3417.046,"I think it's important to recognize one of the observations they also make and I want to get your reaction to it is that they also write in this publication that quote, yet while agencies feel they are Understaffed, few are able to conclusively demonstrate through workload analysis that this is true.",60,,
507,0.97,3417.046,3432.061,"As one focus group participant told us, quote, if the answer to our problems is more staffing we will always be Understaffed.",60,,
508,0.97,3432.061,3436.866,Closed quote.,60,,
509,0.97,3436.866,3445.508,So I think we've already just in this initial conversation we're not seeking to expand the police Department.,61,,
510,0.97,3445.508,3461.024,"We know there were already looking at giving certain positions up with a reduction of almost, you know, 1497 to 1400.",61,,
511,0.97,3461.024,3462.559,I'm looking at downsizing.,61,,
512,0.97,3462.559,3466.029,What the publication was writing.,61,,
513,0.97,3466.029,3472.702,I think it gets into moving certain types of calls for service over to other entities.,61,,
514,0.97,3472.702,3486.249,"I'm also looking at what our current workload is knowing that even if I move those over I'm still going to find ourselves, you know, doing a deeper dive into the functional analysis.",61,,
515,0.97,3486.249,3488.885,Is that where we should be.,61,,
516,0.97,3488.885,3495.425,"And right now there is, there's nothing that's going to take those calls for service.",61,,
517,0.97,3495.425,3495.825,Starting 1ST.,61,,
518,0.97,3495.825,3505.902,So I got to figure out how will we still be able to maintain our ability to respond to the calls for service and the community safety as well.,61,,
519,0.97,3505.902,3506.569,Yeah.,62,,
520,0.97,3506.569,3508.037,And I appreciate that perspective.,62,,
521,0.97,3508.037,3524.854,I think the point that this article is making and that I am endeavoring to get on the record here in this conversation is that I believe that the Seattle police Department's staffing model and assumptions underline that are fundamentally flawed.,62,,
522,0.97,3524.854,3529.125,So long as we are continuing to use the staffing model assumptions and Prince.,62,,
523,0.97,3529.125,3541.871,S that are baked into the Mayor's proposed budget we will continue to see very minimal decreases in the staffing projections.,62,,
524,0.97,3541.871,3542.872,Why Y is that?,62,,
525,0.97,3542.872,3547.043,We use a workload model perspective.,62,,
526,0.97,3547.043,3569.132,"And that is the inherent problem, I believe, in how the staffing model is structured and in why there is a philosophy and a culture of just reduction.",62,,
527,0.97,3569.132,3581.878,"This article continues and concludes that quote, perceived Understaffing may compromise community policing and problem solving efforts.",62,,
528,0.97,3581.878,3586.182,Increased duties arising from fiscal constraints reduce other officer time spent in the community.,62,,
529,0.97,3586.182,3592.088,While transferring community policing duties to Nonofficers.,62,,
530,0.97,3592.088,3607.537,"Again, while Thereforing community policing duties to Nonofficers could help alleviate staffing burdens our interviewees told us this could lead to perceptions that the agency does not care about residents.",62,,
531,0.97,3607.537,3614.243,It's really important for us to acknowledge what is perception and what is being data driven.,62,,
532,0.97,3614.243,3636.165,"To me it is important for us to continue to push ourselves to look at the underlying assumptions of the Seattle police Department staffing models and allow that to lead the work of where the staffing levels should be set as opposed to taking a Widget approach and saying well we have all this work, what else do you want us to do?",62,,
533,0.97,3636.165,3642.538,Well we want to have a conversation about what that workload is.,62,,
534,0.97,3642.538,3649.078,We do believe that the scope of police work has been broadened way beyond the functions of core law enforcement.,62,,
535,0.97,3649.078,3664.327,"That's part of the reason why the city council over the last two to three years has been focusing on bringing back the community service officer program to allow for, again, true community policing by assigning those duties to Nonofficers.",62,,
536,0.97,3664.327,3691.12,That's the kind of conversation I want to engage with you in chief Diaz as opposed to feeling like this morning has begun from a place of I'm drawing the line in the sand at 1400 officers regardless of this Interdepartmentmental task force that the Mayor is beginning to allegedly evaluate staffing levels and scope of work at the police Department.,62,,
537,0.97,3691.12,3721.651,"I want to encourage us to have a conversation from a place of flexibility and understanding and to really acknowledge that there are, there are some really critically wrong issues in terms of the models that policing and governments and cities have been using to make a lot of the decisions around budgets.",62,,
538,0.97,3721.651,3724.153,And the size of police departments palatable.,62,,
539,0.97,3724.153,3729.525,I'm going to go ahead and end my questions there but I'm sure I'm going to have more and Dr.,62,,
540,0.97,3729.525,3732.462,Fisher just got a preview of where I'm going to be headed.,62,,
541,0.97,3732.462,3754.083,"If I might just real briefly, the, I don't think, my perspective we haven't settled on a methodology of the analysis for the functional analysis and the reason to have formed an Idt is to draw in perspectives in addition to SPD's with chief Diaz's central responsibility for the Department.",63,,
542,0.97,3754.083,3757.42,The points you have made are important.,63,,
543,0.97,3757.42,3766.963,Part of this is to rethink and Reunderstand the overall approach and not rely on set Methodologies relied on in the past.,63,,
544,0.97,3766.963,3787.016,The approach needs and wants to be a thoughtful and careful one that isn't fixed in past models I don't think there'll be necessarily a singular approach.,63,,
545,0.97,3787.016,3806.302,What are appropriate functions of uniformed officers and what are not and how that speaks to appropriate staffing levels for the uniformed response and Nonuniformed response.,63,,
546,0.97,3806.302,3810.773,What's the relative work assignments of those different functions.,63,,
547,0.97,3810.773,3816.145,I think they're the same thing.,64,,
548,0.97,3816.145,3827.89,"I mean, I have spent the last three years talking with the executive around the staffing model and my concerns around the underlying assumptions in the staffing model.",64,,
549,0.97,3827.89,3850.813,To have this conversation kick off this morning about how we can Reimagine policing start from a place of there are no circumstances under which any of us should assume that less than 1400 badge and gun jobs are needed at SPD I think is a disservice.,64,,
550,0.97,3850.813,3853.482,It's a disservice to this conversation.,64,,
551,0.97,3853.482,3883.312,And it's I think it's a disservice to the effort to really truly engage in conversation from a perspective of really being open to analyzing and evaluating what core law enforcement functions are necessary at the city of Seattle and which ones are not and have that lead the determination of where we end up in terms of the size of the police Department.,64,,
552,0.97,3883.312,3893.723,So I'm a little concerned that we're starting this conversation from the place of it's 1400 officers or bust.,64,,
553,0.97,3893.723,3899.528,I just don't think that's going to be helpful.,64,,
554,0.97,3899.528,3902.331,"Again, I'm not saying to contradict the chief.",65,,
555,0.97,3902.331,3911.574,What the budget reflects is that that is the place we are until we develop a model and an approach to ensure we have other ways to respond.,65,,
556,0.97,3911.574,3917.446,We all agree police officers are responding to calls where it doesn't make sense that they respond to.,65,,
557,0.97,3917.446,3929.592,The concern is that if we reduce the force before we've developed the model about how we're going to respond to those calls then we're not serving the public.,65,,
558,0.97,3929.592,3930.993,Clearly we need to move quickly.,65,,
559,0.97,3930.993,3933.129,I'll have a series of questions about that.,66,,
560,0.97,3933.129,3939.735,I think I have a different read as what the budget says as it relates to Rehiring in outward years.,66,,
561,0.97,3939.735,3946.542,But I will leave those questions to that portion of the presentation.,66,,
562,0.97,3946.542,3949.645,"Thank you, chairman Mosqueda for allowing me an opportunity to ask those questions.",66,,
563,0.97,3949.645,3950.346,Of course.,67,,
564,0.97,3950.346,3950.813,Thank you very much.,67,,
565,0.97,3950.813,3958.554,"I did want to just NOTE I see Dr. Fisher, you do have yourself off of mute.",67,,
566,0.97,3958.554,3967.863,If you had a response you're welcome to do that before we move to other Council members in case the Council President does have a follow up question.,67,,
567,0.97,3967.863,3970.466,I think the President said we'll get into that in the presentation.,68,,
568,0.97,3970.466,3979.608,I was just going to assure everyone we're going to get into that just to make sure we save time for the whole presentation and don't put it all on the chief to have every answer.,68,,
569,0.97,3979.608,3979.875,Yeah.,69,,
570,0.97,3979.875,3982.611,"No, we are definitely not putting it all on one person.",69,,
571,0.97,3982.611,3991.487,I think this has been a systemic conversation from the beginning and I think it's Imprtant we do have ample opportunity to ask questions so appreciate the chief's time.,69,,
572,0.97,3991.487,3998.394,Given this is a quarter of the budget I think it's an area where we will continue to have a number of questions.,69,,
573,0.97,3998.394,3998.994,I appreciate Angela and Dr.,69,,
574,0.97,3998.994,4012.241,"Fisher your patience as we go through some of these questions because a few more would be helpful just I hope you appreciate in terms of setting the tone in our understanding, a base understanding before we go into the presentation.",69,,
575,0.97,4012.241,4016.445,I see Council member Sawant and Council member Pedersen next.,69,,
576,0.97,4016.445,4017.279,Council member Sawant.,69,,
577,0.97,4017.279,4024.653,Just for starters I really agree with the point that Council member Gonzalez just made.,70,,
578,0.97,4024.653,4028.057,The assumptions underlying the police Department are fundamentally flawed.,70,,
579,0.97,4028.057,4045.875,That's why at the end of the day it's the city council's duty to push for Defunding by at least 50% in this year's budget this fall's budget vote for 2021 and to also push for community oversight.,70,,
580,0.97,4045.875,4052.848,"For chief Diaz, I found your entire presentation very troubling.",70,,
581,0.97,4052.848,4054.583,Not surprising but still troubling nonetheless.,70,,
582,0.97,4054.583,4057.42,Just to preface what I'm about to say.,70,,
583,0.97,4057.42,4061.023,Absolutely public safety is extremely important to all of us.,70,,
584,0.97,4061.023,4068.597,It wouldn't be accurate or fair to say that those who have been marching on the streets for black lives matter do not agree that we want public safety.,70,,
585,0.97,4068.597,4083.779,"In fact the very people who face police violence also face the, if you look at it statistically speaking the worst outcomes in terms of crime because it's often related to social conditions.",70,,
586,0.97,4083.779,4085.314,That's what the data shows.,70,,
587,0.97,4085.314,4086.215,Everyone wants to be safe.,70,,
588,0.97,4086.215,4091.187,All working communities have the right to be safe.,70,,
589,0.97,4091.187,4102.932,"The whole trust of your presentation was to raise a specter of crime, violent crime and the dire outcomes that would result if it there was any kind of reduction to the size of the police Department however minimum.",70,,
590,0.97,4102.932,4114.543,"So I wanted to, I wanted to share some data in this discussion to see what you have to say in response to this.",70,,
591,0.97,4114.543,4127.389,"I wanted to quote from column on Seattle, sorry, on January 10th of this year so just earlier this year the column was titled third world hell hole.",70,,
592,0.97,4127.389,4130.86,New data shows Seattle had lowest property crime in decades.,70,,
593,0.97,4130.86,4136.866,"In that the whole, I'm not going to read the whole column but I'm going to read a part of it.",70,,
594,0.97,4136.866,4151.08,The whole column was in response to the dystopian picture that was being painted by the right wing nationally including rush Limbaugh and Fox news that Seethe million become some sort of hot bed of crime.,70,,
595,0.97,4151.08,4167.796,"Danny, and I'm quoting him because he's very far from being a Socialist like me but this is, he's quoting numbers, he says quote, the truth is that while all was happening around the Internet here on the streets crime actually went down across the board in 2019.",70,,
596,0.97,4167.796,4171.634,Robbery was down percent from a year ago.,70,,
597,0.97,4171.634,4172.501,Burglary was off 6%.,70,,
598,0.97,4172.501,4180.809,Property crime in total was down 6% with a raw number of property crimes the lowest recorded since 2013.,70,,
599,0.97,4180.809,4185.414,Maybe people are so Fed up they aren't reporting all the property crimes.,70,,
600,0.97,4185.414,4189.652,Violent crime was also down by 4% compared to last year.,70,,
601,0.97,4189.652,4194.256,There were five fewer murders.,70,,
602,0.97,4194.256,4198.027,81 fewer aggravated assaults and 181 fewer robberies than 2018.,70,,
603,0.97,4198.027,4201.597,What especially stands out are the low crime rates.,70,,
604,0.97,4201.597,4210.539,"Seattle's violent crime of 6.1 incidents per 100,000 people were the second lowest in a decade according to city data.",70,,
605,0.97,4210.539,4221.85,"The property crime rate of 4,949 incidents per 100,000 people is by far the lowest recorded in the city since at least the 1970s.",70,,
606,0.97,4221.85,4234.897,"The rate in 2019 was 20% lower than it was just five years ago and more than 40% lower than it was 20 years ago, Unquote.",70,,
607,0.97,4234.897,4239.935,"Again, I want to say my point is in no way to minimize any crime, let alone violent crime.",70,,
608,0.97,4239.935,4243.639,For the victim of that crime that is one crime too many.,70,,
609,0.97,4243.639,4250.112,"But the specter you are presenting, chief Diaz, sorry, is simply not born out by statistics.",70,,
610,0.97,4250.112,4262.658,On the contrary you have been completely silent in your introduction on the massive time your officers spend assaulting protesters and harassing communities of color.,70,,
611,0.97,4262.658,4275.471,"So my question is as the leader of this Department how do you justify this presentation in general but especially in the context of black lives matter, the outrage at racist policing and excessive violence.",70,,
612,0.97,4275.471,4297.059,How are your points and the trust of everything you said in any way in line with the reality of Statistics and also what do you have to say about racist policing and the Violencethat is being directed against protesters because I know a lot of people want to hear about that.,70,,
613,0.97,4297.059,4297.359,Thank you.,70,,
614,0.97,4297.359,4299.128,"Thank you, council member.",71,,
615,0.97,4299.128,4308.07,So I think right now the first part is that any officer that has done wrong goes through a process.,71,,
616,0.97,4308.07,4313.876,I've had already in my short period of time have held officers accountable for their actions.,71,,
617,0.97,4313.876,4318.547,That is part of making sure they have a robust accountability system.,71,,
618,0.97,4318.547,4320.716,Some might not trust that system.,71,,
619,0.97,4320.716,4322.351,That's a system we have in place.,71,,
620,0.97,4322.351,4330.759,I'm willing to make sure that any officer that has done some level of wrong doing is held accountable.,71,,
621,0.97,4330.759,4335.13,I completely have supported black lives matter and the movement.,71,,
622,0.97,4335.13,4342.705,I've done my work in probably for over half my career in community.,71,,
623,0.97,4342.705,4347.676,"I have been invested when people working with youth, working with community groups.",71,,
624,0.97,4347.676,4357.686,Spending my time invested in those areas.,71,,
625,0.97,4357.686,4360.589,I have been in the mix of that.,71,,
626,0.97,4360.589,4362.524,That is my commitment to the community.,71,,
627,0.97,4362.524,4370.365,My commitment is to making sure that I'm serving this city in the most appropriate and the safest manner.,71,,
628,0.97,4370.365,4375.27,That I provide the leadership to make sure this Department is held accountable for its actions.,71,,
629,0.97,4375.27,4379.441,"When officers do wrong, they're going to be held accountable.",71,,
630,0.97,4379.441,4386.782,"Just as a quick follow up, I don't expect any dramatic shifts in your thinking, chief Diaz.",72,,
631,0.97,4386.782,4390.319,But can you give us some specific examples?,72,,
632,0.97,4390.319,4393.389,You say you've held officers accountable.,72,,
633,0.97,4393.389,4397.459,I'm assuming you're talking about within the Department under your chain of command?,72,,
634,0.97,4397.459,4401.897,I don't know if you're talking about official process.,72,,
635,0.97,4401.897,4410.372,But give us some examples of where you think that you actually are holding officers accountable.,72,,
636,0.97,4410.372,4420.115,So we've put two officers on administrative leave in a very short period of time for actions that are resulted in.,73,,
637,0.97,4420.115,4422.284,That were inappropriate and that have gone.,73,,
638,0.97,4422.284,4426.855,One I sent over for criminal investigation the King County sheriff's office.,73,,
639,0.97,4426.855,4433.962,I've had to also move forward on Terminations of officers.,73,,
640,0.97,4433.962,4435.631,Just in the last month.,73,,
641,0.97,4435.631,4444.673,"Right now until all the paperwork is finalized, you know, those right now are actually areas that have I have done over the last month.",73,,
642,0.97,4444.673,4446.008,Thank you very much.,74,,
643,0.97,4446.008,4473.735,Thank you as well Council member Sawant and perhaps we can put a pin in that to continue to see where some of those accountability pieces could be reflected or lifted up or analyzed in the composed budget we see so we can see if there's additional need to either invest in or ask more questions about the ways in which the chief has additional accountability measures within his own Department outside of the accountability partners.,74,,
644,0.97,4473.735,4477.906,Think it's an important question you've asked.,74,,
645,0.97,4477.906,4478.474,Council member Pedersen.,74,,
646,0.97,4478.474,4479.174,Please go ahead.,74,,
647,0.97,4479.174,4480.075,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,75,,
648,0.97,4480.075,4490.152,Thank you chief Diaz and to you and your team.,75,,
649,0.97,4490.152,4490.652,Thanksfor taking over.,75,,
650,0.97,4490.652,4497.292,"Just wanted to, I was recalling there was a study done in 2016 about police staffing and I think it focused on response times.",75,,
651,0.97,4497.292,4502.497,I think it was called the Berkshire report.,75,,
652,0.97,4502.497,4509.071,"I wasn't here in 2016 in office then but I just, in terms, if you could just throw that in the mix.",75,,
653,0.97,4509.071,4522.351,I know response times have been a concern of constituents of mine in the North precinct which is a huge geographic area.,75,,
654,0.97,4522.351,4526.421,Want to encourage you to throw you in the mix.,75,,
655,0.97,4526.421,4531.894,There was an exhaustive study done in 2016.,75,,
656,0.97,4531.894,4548.243,"To the extent you're able to through your remarks today to your team, whenever there's something that you want to do that there's not the flexibility that it's creating a huge expense item.",75,,
657,0.97,4548.243,4554.449,Looking for ways to redeploy resources to Community-Led solutions.,75,,
658,0.97,4554.449,4562.19,"To the extent you're able to point to the police contract, the labor contract with the Seattle police officer's Guild as being an impediment.",75,,
659,0.97,4562.19,4564.893,That would be helpful to highlight that.,75,,
660,0.97,4564.893,4573.302,I know sometimes we sort of divorce the budget from it the employment contract even though the employment contract is comprising 80% of the cost sometimes.,75,,
661,0.97,4573.302,4577.139,"To the extent you're able to speak to that through your presentation, that would be helpful.",75,,
662,0.97,4577.139,4579.741,I know there are certain limitations to that.,75,,
663,0.97,4579.741,4585.948,I wanted to flag that we know that the contract can be problematic too.,75,,
664,0.97,4585.948,4586.248,Thank you.,75,,
665,0.97,4586.248,4586.615,Thank you.,76,,
666,0.97,4586.615,4590.419,Thank you very much Council member Pedersen.,77,,
667,0.97,4590.419,4594.523,"Chief Diaz, I didn't mean to cut you off.",77,,
668,0.97,4594.523,4595.357,Did you have anything else?,77,,
669,0.97,4595.357,4595.724,No.,78,,
670,0.97,4595.724,4607.202,I think Council member Pedersen one of the biggest things that I'm always constantly evaluating is the overtime expenditures.,78,,
671,0.97,4607.202,4619.982,For us it's about making sure there are areas we spend the most overtime making sure is staffed properly with our existing resources to try to drive down budgetary issues.,78,,
672,0.97,4619.982,4622.184,"So I'm not, you know, paying a lot of overtime.",78,,
673,0.97,4622.184,4628.657,That is something that has come up over the last several years.,78,,
674,0.97,4628.657,4631.159,There was the Seattle auditor's office had done a report.,78,,
675,0.97,4631.159,4636.465,Those are areas I'm constantly looking at and evaluating.,78,,
676,0.97,4636.465,4638.734,How can we create more efficiency.,78,,
677,0.97,4638.734,4643.238,How can we be more judicious in how we spend our doctors.,78,,
678,0.97,4643.238,4646.241,We want to make sure we're tight.,78,,
679,0.97,4646.241,4652.547,We want to make sure it's the right use of city taxpayer dollars.,78,,
680,0.97,4652.547,4655.217,Those are areas we're moving forward on.,78,,
681,0.97,4655.217,4656.385,Moving officers back into patrol.,78,,
682,0.97,4656.385,4661.79,I was spending a lot of officer time and Augmentation shifts.,78,,
683,0.97,4661.79,4667.596,Or so trying to get up to a certain level of staffing.,78,,
684,0.97,4667.596,4677.873,"Now that we have officers in patrol I'm able to meet that Guyline and reduce that level of overtime that I'm going to end up, that I was going to experience later on.",78,,
685,0.97,4677.873,4684.413,We did that within the Confounds of the contract as well.,78,,
686,0.97,4684.413,4690.519,"So, you know, as we I was already working with our side of it.",78,,
687,0.97,4690.519,4698.694,"I knew operation what we needed to do and we had, while we saw the contract we also had to make sure we worked within the confines of the contract.",78,,
688,0.97,4698.694,4709.371,We were able to do that and also reduce overtime as well.,78,,
689,0.97,4709.371,4709.671,Thank you.,78,,
690,0.97,4709.671,4710.138,Council President.,79,,
691,0.97,4710.138,4714.543,Just a couple of things.,80,,
692,0.97,4714.543,4720.048,One is the 2016 Berkshire staffing study.,80,,
693,0.97,4720.048,4724.519,"I certainly, my preference would be that we not look at that.",80,,
694,0.97,4724.519,4738.533,It had very little utility frankly and I'm happy to talk to you Council member Pedersen about concerns I had about that and concerns that the frankly at the time the police Department had with the results of that study.,80,,
695,0.97,4738.533,4743.338,I do think this is an opportunity for us to taken a different approach.,80,,
696,0.97,4743.338,4755.584,One that is going to focus primarily on what the staffing model should be moving forward.,80,,
697,0.97,4755.584,4757.986,"Taking performance, outcomes and other data points.",80,,
698,0.97,4757.986,4763.191,That needs to be Holistic and not just focused on functions and workload.,80,,
699,0.97,4763.191,4768.163,That's one thing I wanted to say.,80,,
700,0.97,4768.163,4780.075,The second thing I just want to highlight as it relates to Council member Pedersen's comments about the collective bargaining agreements.,80,,
701,0.97,4780.075,4802.063,"It is important for us in this budget conversation to acknowledge and be transparent that there are portions, significant portions of the collective bargaining agreements both with Spda and Spog that do contribute to a bloated need for staffing.",80,,
702,0.97,4802.063,4813.642,That is contributing significantly to overtime costs and to on going costs as it relates to the number of sworn officers that are actually might be needed.,80,,
703,0.97,4813.642,4819.014,So those are barriers that I think need to be acknowledged publicly.,80,,
704,0.97,4819.014,4829.824,Those are issues that will need to be squarely and directly addressed by the members of the labor relations policy committee of which five Council members sit on.,80,,
705,0.97,4829.824,4844.139,I appreciate Council member Pedersen's on going reminder to us and the Department that these issues present real barriers.,80,,
706,0.97,4844.139,4855.55,To achieving more change as it relates to staffing decisions and budget implications related to the same.,80,,
707,0.97,4855.55,4856.117,"Thank you, chair.",80,,
708,0.97,4856.117,4857.886,Thank you very much.,81,,
709,0.97,4857.886,4865.126,"Thank you, council member Pedersen as well for those questions that you asked and chief Diaz for your response.",81,,
710,0.97,4865.126,4867.662,I think we can move into the presentation.,81,,
711,0.97,4867.662,4874.269,We do have about two hours still for this morning's session so we should have plenty of time.,81,,
712,0.97,4874.269,4880.375,"Chief Diaz, I have one more sort of framing question as we head into this.",81,,
713,0.97,4880.375,4888.717,I believe that you mentioned even after you Transitioned more officers into foot patrol that you still have the same amount of Individals in patrol that you had eight years ago.,81,,
714,0.97,4888.717,4893.488,Is that the accurate number I heard?,81,,
715,0.97,4893.488,4899.194,"I think Chris, Dr. Fisher can be able to highlight the exact numbers.",82,,
716,0.97,4899.194,4903.665,But he'll do his part of that presentation.,82,,
717,0.97,4903.665,4904.065,Excellent.,83,,
718,0.97,4904.065,4904.266,Okay.,83,,
719,0.97,4904.266,4904.733,Thank you very much.,83,,
720,0.97,4904.733,4905.4,The reason I ask that.,83,,
721,0.97,4905.4,4908.136,I want to tee this up for framing the discussion today.,83,,
722,0.97,4908.136,4913.742,I'm going to share a screen with you all.,83,,
723,0.97,4913.742,4931.092,"Is because we've seen from the reports, especially over the last year or few months here that we've seen number of accounts where the Seattle police Department's budget has increased about 45% over that same period of time over the last eight years.",83,,
724,0.97,4931.092,4939.901,In fact we see the highest number or the most exponential increase in the time Mayor Durkan has been in office.,83,,
725,0.97,4939.901,4944.973,It'll be important to do the analysis was right size of the police Department's budget.,83,,
726,0.97,4944.973,4951.98,You correctly noted that the population in Seattle has increased.,83,,
727,0.97,4951.98,4959.854,But according to the same report we know that the number of dollars per capita has increased.,83,,
728,0.97,4959.854,4963.658,It's not a matter of the dollars per individuals going down.,83,,
729,0.97,4963.658,4966.428,The dollars per individuals has gone up.,83,,
730,0.97,4966.428,4968.997,As the population has increased.,83,,
731,0.97,4968.997,4981.776,I think these two charts really highlight the importance of the conversation that the Council President Teed up at the beginning which is really a question about the adequate workload.,83,,
732,0.97,4981.776,4986.481,The right functions and the right staffing model for those functions.,83,,
733,0.97,4986.481,4993.955,I wanted to tee this up as we have a conversation about what the proposed budget looks like for 2021.,83,,
734,0.97,4993.955,5013.041,"And also continue to remind us that as this makes up about a quarter of General fund this is really critical not just for answering the calls for what the right size, scope and functions of the police Department are but as we're facing a huge economic crisis trying to be good stewards of the public dollar is important.",83,,
735,0.97,5013.041,5017.812,I'll stop sharing my screen and turn it back over to you all to walk us through the presentation.,83,,
736,0.97,5017.812,5023.051,I want to say thank you for helping to tee up this conversation today for fielding these questions.,83,,
737,0.97,5023.051,5027.355,I'm sure there will be more throughout this morning.,83,,
738,0.97,5027.355,5031.86,But I think this conversation is not the first time to have a chance to have a discussion.,83,,
739,0.97,5031.86,5037.632,It'll be the on going discussion over the next few months and we've initiated it earlier this summer and over the fall.,83,,
740,0.97,5037.632,5044.606,"Thanks for Teeing this up and before we turn it over to Angela, any other comments from you?",83,,
741,0.97,5044.606,5047.442,"No, thank you so much.",84,,
742,0.97,5047.442,5050.278,I know executive director Socci is waiting.,84,,
743,0.97,5050.278,5050.645,I'm sorry.,85,,
744,0.97,5050.645,5053.815,Did I see a hand Council member Morales?,85,,
745,0.97,5053.815,5060.555,"Well, I do have one question for the chief before we move on.",86,,
746,0.97,5060.555,5068.897,I think I heard you say that you had moved some detective units back to patrol.,86,,
747,0.97,5068.897,5080.275,I'm interested in which units because what I'm concerned about is the impact on investigations for sex trafficking for sexual assault and domestic violence.,86,,
748,0.97,5080.275,5084.579,I know we've spoken a little about some of these issues before.,86,,
749,0.97,5084.579,5094.222,"I am interested to understand why those units were moved to patrol, especially in light of some of the comments you just made about the increase in those issues.",86,,
750,0.97,5094.222,5101.496,"Sex trafficking never moved so I'm not sure that unit, it's in relation to human trafficking.",87,,
751,0.97,5101.496,5106.935,There was no bodies that moved out of that unit.,87,,
752,0.97,5106.935,5119.147,The sexual offender detail had one that we looked at an analysis over the last five years to determine what that staffing level was and that is relatively steady.,87,,
753,0.97,5119.147,5129.858,"There was, we had a body that was a worked in the city attorney's office that had no connection to sexual assault cases.",87,,
754,0.97,5129.858,5131.359,That Positionwas agree gaited.,87,,
755,0.97,5131.359,5133.661,Looks like there were two positions.,87,,
756,0.97,5133.661,5144.072,We have sent over the actual units and then Dv was another unit that we are also currently assessing case loads for.,87,,
757,0.97,5144.072,5156.951,We also took a five year and ten year analysis of how many detectives currently staff it and it was a minimal impact on the detectives that left.,87,,
758,0.97,5156.951,5164.292,It wasn't a full Agreation of the whole unit or anything like that.,87,,
759,0.97,5164.292,5164.993,Loads look like.,87,,
760,0.97,5164.993,5172.333,To determine if there's any major impact to our ability to respond to Dv and investigate Dv cases.,87,,
761,0.97,5172.333,5178.006,Especially in light of Covid we know domestic violence is up.,88,,
762,0.97,5178.006,5192.587,Somebody was killed just the other day and so I want to encourage us to make sure that we are keeping people safe in that regard.,88,,
763,0.97,5192.587,5193.321,May I just ask?,89,,
764,0.97,5193.321,5198.526,Vice chair and chair of public safety Council member Herbold.,90,,
765,0.97,5198.526,5198.826,Thank you.,90,,
766,0.97,5198.826,5208.136,I appreciate Council member Morales' questions as it relates to the transfer from specialty units to patrol.,91,,
767,0.97,5208.136,5213.708,I understand the reason why the chief is seeking to transfer.,91,,
768,0.97,5213.708,5222.35,I too have been for a while now been seeking a little bit more detail.,91,,
769,0.97,5222.35,5257.585,"I requested and received the numbers of officers transferred from each specialty unit to patrol but one of the answers that I've not yet received not just the numbers of officers being transferred from a specialized unit to patrol, specialized units like sexual assault, Dv, elder abuse, but how many are remaining in each of those specialty units.",91,,
770,0.97,5257.585,5267.662,"It doesn't give us much context to know, you know, two officers were transferred without knowing the number of officers that are still in that specialized unit.",91,,
771,0.97,5267.662,5288.182,I just want to let my colleagues on the Council know that I am seeking that information and still seeking it and when I receive it I will either share it with you or the fact that chief Diaz now knows there's broader interest than just my interest maybe you could just share it with Everybod.,91,,
772,0.97,5288.182,5301.462,I hope the fact I've asked this question a couple weeks ago now that it won't go into sort of the budget answer question process.,91,,
773,0.97,5301.462,5307.168,Hopefully there's something ready that will be sent to us within the next day or so as opposed to having to go through Sharepoint and all that.,91,,
774,0.97,5307.168,5311.472,We'll work with our staff to make sure we get the information.,92,,
775,0.97,5311.472,5312.24,Thank you.,93,,
776,0.97,5312.24,5312.573,Excellent.,94,,
777,0.97,5312.573,5313.341,Thank you.,94,,
778,0.97,5313.341,5314.676,Long awaited presentation from Angela.,94,,
779,0.97,5314.676,5316.811,We'll turn it over to Angela.,94,,
780,0.97,5316.811,5327.221,Thank you chief Diaz for fielding those questions which I'm sure there will be more to come but appreciate your Intro remarks and answering those questions for us.,94,,
781,0.97,5327.221,5328.256,"Angela, please go ahead.",94,,
782,0.97,5328.256,5329.257,All right.,95,,
783,0.97,5329.257,5342.437,If I can get confirmation that folks can see my screen that would be wonderful.,95,,
784,0.97,5342.437,5342.837,Thank you.,95,,
785,0.97,5342.837,5343.237,Thank you.,95,,
786,0.97,5343.237,5343.538,All right.,95,,
787,0.97,5343.538,5352.68,So we've been through with chief Diaz his priorities for as newly appointed chief.,95,,
788,0.97,5352.68,5358.252,I'll pause briefly here for folks to absorb this information.,95,,
789,0.97,5358.252,5365.259,As I believe it's being published for the first time with a budget and then we'll go ahead and move right on in.,95,,
790,0.97,5365.259,5380.375,I'm going to see if I can move the Video portion.,95,,
791,0.97,5380.375,5382.51,All right.,95,,
792,0.97,5382.51,5396.19,So the table here represents the 2020 adopted budget along the 2020 revised and 2021 proposed.,95,,
793,0.97,5396.19,5433.995,"These changes both dollars across the multiple funds within the Department along with the FTE captured here are based on the net changes compared, net change between the 2020 adopted to 2020 revised which is going to include the rebalancing package along with the Council changes and supplemental budget information and then alongside then the 2021 proposed.",95,,
794,0.97,5433.995,5434.862,An important comment here.,95,,
795,0.97,5434.862,5444.672,The comparison of the 2021 proposed to the 2020 adopted and 2020 revised budgets suspect necessarily going to align perfectly with the budget.,95,,
796,0.97,5444.672,5456.184,The change requests that are enters that will be reviewed by central staff and others are going to be taken from the 2021 baseline budget.,95,,
797,0.97,5456.184,5464.358,There may be some discrepancies between the $49 million reflected here and other publications that have gone out.,95,,
798,0.97,5464.358,5480.074,"High level, our change from the 2020 adopted is 49 Million- dollar cut, $35 million from the 2020 revised.",95,,
799,0.97,5480.074,5500.728,"From an FTE or position standpoint we're going from in 2020 adopted, 2,1 L 4 FTE to a level of 1,853 in 2021.",95,,
800,0.97,5500.728,5507.335,There are no questions we'll move along.,95,,
801,0.97,5507.335,5518.546,We've discussed the sworn staffing level is going to make up as everyone knows about 80% of our budget is attributable to personnel costs.,95,,
802,0.97,5518.546,5520.248,82% in 2020.,95,,
803,0.97,5520.248,5520.581,80% in 2021.,95,,
804,0.97,5520.581,5533.16,The majority of that reduction we're taking going into 2021 is attributable to the cut of funding for 97 sworn police officers.,95,,
805,0.97,5533.16,5538.399,The Agregation of 47 of those 97.,95,,
806,0.97,5538.399,5558.586,We're cutting funding for 40 civilian positions for a savings of 4.1 million and also cutting funding for overtime for selected events and emphasis patrols for a savings of 2.7 million.,95,,
807,0.97,5558.586,5565.259,So there's a lot of interest around staffing.,95,,
808,0.97,5565.259,5588.282,"Around that sworn number of 14 P. I want to take an opportunity to reiterate that as we were writing this budget we asked ourselves who will respond to emergency calls on January 1. even if we could come to an agreement on alternatives, by the end of the budget process can we as a city hire, train and deploy these new resources by January 1.",95,,
809,0.97,5588.282,5590.518,What infrastructure is needed.,95,,
810,0.97,5590.518,5592.72,How much capacity is needed.,95,,
811,0.97,5592.72,5598.292,Can we leverage community relationships to expedite the Rollout of those alternatives.,95,,
812,0.97,5598.292,5601.562,How will we finance the transition.,95,,
813,0.97,5601.562,5602.563,There will be overlap?,95,,
814,0.97,5602.563,5609.537,We recognize there were many outstanding questions.,95,,
815,0.97,5609.537,5612.106,Engage with the community to answer some of those questions.,95,,
816,0.97,5612.106,5614.041,I know the executive has done work.,95,,
817,0.97,5614.041,5616.11,I know Council has done work in that area.,95,,
818,0.97,5616.11,5620.081,"I just want to, I'm not here to make value judgments.",95,,
819,0.97,5620.081,5626.153,I'm not here to say 1400 is the number.,95,,
820,0.97,5626.153,5631.692,The status quo today 1400 is necessary to maintain that status quo.,95,,
821,0.97,5631.692,5634.028,That's why it was built into the budget.,95,,
822,0.97,5634.028,5640.768,We estimated it would take two years to implement a new dispatch system.,95,,
823,0.97,5640.768,5642.436,This is common for I.T.,95,,
824,0.97,5642.436,5642.703,Projects.,95,,
825,0.97,5642.703,5647.074,"We build in time for quality assurance, change management.",95,,
826,0.97,5647.074,5652.48,We account for learning curves and build in extra funding for contingencies.,95,,
827,0.97,5652.48,5669.063,"I may be too linear and too focused on logistics but when I think about tackling a major shift in how we provide city services I think the, what you're seeing here is a conservative approach to that.",95,,
828,0.97,5669.063,5674.635,The shifting tide around how we provide community safety services in the city.,95,,
829,0.97,5674.635,5683.844,We tried to acknowledge that in what's going to be forthcoming on the community safety proposal.,95,,
830,0.97,5683.844,5687.415,From our vantage point successful projects start with a plan.,95,,
831,0.97,5687.415,5704.131,A plan starts as an idea and it requires careful planning especially when it's planning major changes to basic city services.,95,,
832,0.97,5704.131,5708.369,This is meant to be a holding place what's built into the budget.,95,,
833,0.97,5708.369,5714.542,As everyone knows we have processes in it place to modify that budget.,95,,
834,0.97,5714.542,5714.942,As it's adopted.,95,,
835,0.97,5714.942,5718.546,We modify the proposed budgets through this Council process.,95,,
836,0.97,5718.546,5735.262,"So through that lens I just ask everyone to look into, as these next slides come up, know that is the context through which we establish this budget.",95,,
837,0.97,5735.262,5747.742,"By providing historical staffing information, it is really intended to provide you as policymakers with factual good information to inform your policy decisions.",95,,
838,0.97,5747.742,5756.984,I truly believe that's my role is to make sure you have the information you need in order to make those decisions.,95,,
839,0.97,5756.984,5758.486,With that I will jump into.,95,,
840,0.97,5758.486,5759.587,Thank you so much.,96,,
841,0.97,5759.587,5761.555,I to see two hands.,96,,
842,0.97,5761.555,5771.565,I'm going to allow for Council member Herbold and Morales to ask clarifying questions.,96,,
843,0.97,5771.565,5784.078,Because I didn't announce that earlier if you have clarifying questions and then we'll get through the presentation and I'll go through each person so they have a chance to ask a number of questions.,96,,
844,0.97,5784.078,5790.484,Do know that means we will have to have time at the end for letting folks ask those questions.,96,,
845,0.97,5790.484,5792.019,"Council member Herbold, please.",96,,
846,0.97,5792.019,5806.033,"Angela, I just wanted to say that I appreciate the final comments that you made around you know how you take an idea and turn it into a plan.",97,,
847,0.97,5806.033,5808.736,And then implement it.,97,,
848,0.97,5808.736,5831.559,But I also want to say that our budget actions that we take in the fall to go into effect starting in the following year we can build into those budgets assumptions that plans can be executed at times throughout the year.,97,,
849,0.97,5831.559,5837.765,Not every plan that our budget recognizes has to go into effect January 1ST.,97,,
850,0.97,5837.765,5861.188,"But it's very important I think for policymakers, for members of the public who we're engaging with and for the city internally in order to hold ourselves accountable for us to use the budget as a way to set goals and Timelines for realizing those plans.",97,,
851,0.97,5861.188,5868.195,"And, again, I haven't had a chance to take a careful look at the executive order.",97,,
852,0.97,5868.195,5874.902,I am concerned from it first glance is it doesn't seem to identify Timelines.,97,,
853,0.97,5874.902,5893.787,"So I think what I would like to see in this budget is a recognition that Yeah, we can't necessarily shift the answering to a bunch of 911 calls over to somebody else January 1ST but we can build a budget with some assumptions around when we expect that to happen.",97,,
854,0.97,5893.787,5896.257,We can build a plan to make it possible.,97,,
855,0.97,5896.257,5903.898,"And I think I heard you say that, but I want our budget to reflect that.",97,,
856,0.97,5903.898,5907.501,Hopefully we can work together to do so.,97,,
857,0.97,5907.501,5914.441,I do have clarifying questions about the previous slide.,97,,
858,0.97,5914.441,5923.717,"Just want to make sure the funding for the 97 sworn police officers, these are vacant positions; that's correct?",97,,
859,0.97,5923.717,5924.184,That's correct.,98,,
860,0.97,5924.184,5932.393,"And then the cut funding for the 40 FTE civilian positions, are those the transfers to the other departments?",99,,
861,0.97,5932.393,5936.096,I don't think so because that wouldn't be a cut.,99,,
862,0.97,5936.096,5937.831,What are those?,99,,
863,0.97,5937.831,5945.639,"So that was, so the civilian cut was developed at the outset of the budget process.",100,,
864,0.97,5945.639,5952.579,"It accounts for the savings, it's a continuation of the civilian hiring freeze that was implemented in 2020 in response to Covid.",100,,
865,0.97,5952.579,5956.684,You saw some of those cuts in your 2020 rebalancing package.,100,,
866,0.97,5956.684,5965.626,This item here is a continuation of those cuts into next year.,100,,
867,0.97,5965.626,5965.859,Sorry.,100,,
868,0.97,5965.859,5967.695,Then my last question related to overtime.,101,,
869,0.97,5967.695,5991.919,One of the items that I think has been perennially raised around special events and overtime is the question and I was visited by a coalition of organizations that traditionally work with the special events committee to put on large events every year.,101,,
870,0.97,5991.919,6004.465,"Want to flag and I don't want if this links to this item on overtime, the long standing practice of having police officers act as Flaggers.",101,,
871,0.97,6004.465,6011.205,"That is not, there's this narrative out there that state law requires it to be uniform police officers.",101,,
872,0.97,6011.205,6015.242,That is not in fact the case.,101,,
873,0.97,6015.242,6028.021,And I really want to look at having somebody other than police officers serve this function.,101,,
874,0.97,6028.021,6049.042,"It's very expensive and in a financial atmosphere where we want to make sure we're Recooping the costs to the city associated with special events, we want to work with the promoters of special events so that they do so so they fully compensate the city for the cost associated with special event Thes.",101,,
875,0.97,6049.042,6058.085,We don't want to be using the most expensive staffing model for those events.,101,,
876,0.97,6058.085,6073.767,"I'm hoping that this cut in overtime includes a shift away from uniformed officers acting as Flaggers at special events or even, you know, street closures associated with construction projects.",101,,
877,0.97,6073.767,6091.785,And looks at a shift towards either Nonuniform police officers or other city employees like potentially Sdot employees.,101,,
878,0.97,6091.785,6094.521,Just backing up.,102,,
879,0.97,6094.521,6098.392,Executive order does have deadlines.,102,,
880,0.97,6098.392,6100.294,In anticipation of supplemental budgetary actions to follow.,102,,
881,0.97,6100.294,6107.634,But I think it's a good discussion for this afternoon in greater detail.,102,,
882,0.97,6107.634,6108.235,Council member Morales.,103,,
883,0.97,6108.235,6111.371,Well I just had a question about that too.,104,,
884,0.97,6111.371,6115.609,I'm interested to know which selected events will be included here.,104,,
885,0.97,6115.609,6117.177,So we can get more information.,104,,
886,0.97,6117.177,6121.114,More specific information on that.,104,,
887,0.97,6121.114,6122.115,That'd be great.,104,,
888,0.97,6122.115,6124.618,Thank you Council member Morales.,105,,
889,0.97,6124.618,6149.276,Colleagues please take a note of the slides you would like the Presenters to go back to and I will go through the roll at the end of the presentation to make sure everybody gets a chance to ask questions.,105,,
890,0.97,6158.051,6188.015,"So to Council member Herbold's point, the, she's absolutely right we could build into the budget to the best of our ability anticipate changes and what alternatives in 2021 would look like when it comes to police staffing we have a lot of historical data we can look at.",106,,
891,0.97,6188.015,6198.692,As someone in budget I've followed this closely not only through the drastic increases in our personnel costs.,106,,
892,0.97,6198.692,6210.537,Tied almost to sworn salaries tied to that contract.,106,,
893,0.97,6210.537,6227.854,"The point I want to make here as we contemplate next steps around sworn staffing whether the number is 1400 or 1300, you know, 1200, whatever the number ends up being.",106,,
894,0.97,6227.854,6228.322,Whatever we decide.,106,,
895,0.97,6228.322,6237.197,"For those, I'm able to read from some of the budget questions we've received for those of you who might be contemplating a continuation of the hiring freeze into 2021.",106,,
896,0.97,6237.197,6243.47,I just want to use this opportunity to explain the impacts of that.,106,,
897,0.97,6243.47,6251.545,"The last time we Implemened a hiring freeze, you'll see it in the slide here, was in 2010.",106,,
898,0.97,6251.545,6252.179,Extended through 2011.,106,,
899,0.97,6252.179,6254.781,2 it was in response to the great recession.,106,,
900,0.97,6254.781,6261.054,"Even though we resumed hiring, we didn't see net new hires until 2013.",106,,
901,0.97,6261.054,6267.628,Those hires weren't deployed until December of that year.,106,,
902,0.97,6267.628,6276.67,Fortunately for us at that point the economic downturn caused by the great recession slowed attrition.,106,,
903,0.97,6276.67,6286.78,"If you slide over to the far right of that chart on the slide, we have seen a significant decrease in our deployable resources this year.",106,,
904,0.97,6286.78,6293.72,Largely tied to the hiring freeze that was implemented earlier this year.,106,,
905,0.97,6293.72,6305.198,Also tied to Covid and an increase of people on administrative leave whether it's paid parental leave.,106,,
906,0.97,6305.198,6308.235,The Continuations just for extra context and perspective.,106,,
907,0.97,6308.235,6313.64,I'll will providing this information to central staff so we can certainly dive into it deeper.,106,,
908,0.97,6313.64,6321.081,"Should we continue a hiring freeze into next year, within a year our number will resemble police staffing in the 80s.",106,,
909,0.97,6321.081,6325.919,"At the time the Seattle population was less than 500,000.",106,,
910,0.97,6325.919,6331.725,That could very well be the direction we're headed in or the direction we should head in as a city.,106,,
911,0.97,6331.725,6337.798,"Again, not here to make those value judgments.",106,,
912,0.97,6337.798,6351.144,I think it's important that should we revert to those staffing levels it is absolutely critical that we expedite the development and deployment of Thos alternative models we're talking about.,106,,
913,0.97,6351.144,6369.029,"The funding, the cuts to our funding going into next year I just, I can't emphasize enough that at some point, you know f we decrease our staffing 100 or 200 and change our minds it's going to take many years to Recuperate.",106,,
914,0.97,6369.029,6373.567,Or we'll have to live with the service impacts for the time in between.,106,,
915,0.97,6373.567,6379.206,"So whether there's overlap in those services or not overlap in those services, perhaps that's okay too.",106,,
916,0.97,6379.206,6401.461,"I think we just need to acknowledge that until we stand up alternatives, until we identify what functions are going to be transferred out of the Department, it's truly critical to understand that, you know, we need to do our best to anticipate where we might end up because we need to start planning now if we're going to hire or not going to hire.",106,,
917,0.97,6401.461,6417.611,"I can tell you that with the hiring freeze we implemented this year, almost simultaneously we started planning for hiring when hiring was going to resume, you know, towards the end of the year.",106,,
918,0.97,6417.611,6419.346,It takes time to test.,106,,
919,0.97,6419.346,6421.114,It takes time to recruit candidates for testing.,106,,
920,0.97,6421.114,6424.718,There's a number of steps that have to happen.,106,,
921,0.97,6424.718,6432.859,I just encourage everyone to keep that in mind as we contemplate what the appropriate level of staffing at the police Department is.,106,,
922,0.97,6432.859,6440.066,Whatever number you choose to fund also keep in mind that we will field about 10% less of that.,106,,
923,0.97,6440.066,6452.546,"When you factor in our shift relief, our furlough schedules, the officers available for emergency response each day will be a small fraction of the whole.",106,,
924,0.97,6452.546,6454.347,Those are just a few high level points.,106,,
925,0.97,6454.347,6463.123,"More than happy to go into this in greater detail either Offline, through the budget Q & amp; a.",106,,
926,0.97,6463.123,6474.734,"But I urge everyone to think about as we contemplate cuts to the budget, just know that for us that 1400 is necessary for the maintenance of our current service.",106,,
927,0.97,6474.734,6487.013,We can make changes to that service but just know that we'll need to anticipate that in advance so we can plan the staffing and hiring piece accordingly.,106,,
928,0.97,6487.013,6501.595,With that I will pass it on to Chris to dive in a little more into the staffing models that are used to develop our minimum staffing.,106,,
929,0.97,6501.595,6505.565,Then just some context sharing there.,106,,
930,0.97,6505.565,6505.799,Chris.,106,,
931,0.97,6505.799,6506.266,"Thank you, Angela.",107,,
932,0.97,6506.266,6518.245,As we saw in the opening we anticipated there would be some questions around how the Úseattle police Department does the work of figuring out how many people it needs where and then you add those up and that tells you how many you need in total.,107,,
933,0.97,6518.245,6525.051,"As the chief pointed out, we do not use a per capita analysis to decide what's the right number.",107,,
934,0.97,6525.051,6529.222,There are a variety of reasons why you shouldn't.,107,,
935,0.97,6529.222,6534.327,The reason it is Referenced is it does provide you context.,107,,
936,0.97,6534.327,6536.296,Chair son always provides context.,107,,
937,0.97,6536.296,6541.735,It helps us ensure we're not in the wrong ballpark or the wrong sport to play out the analogy.,107,,
938,0.97,6541.735,6546.606,What you see here is these are the 25 largest cities by population.,107,,
939,0.97,6546.606,6549.409,The blue bars are the population.,107,,
940,0.97,6549.409,6555.181,"The Orange dots are their per capita sworn per 100,000.",107,,
941,0.97,6555.181,6555.849,Seattle is at 185.,107,,
942,0.97,6555.849,6563.623,This is data reported by all of these cities across the U.S.,107,,
943,0.97,6563.623,6571.831,"The crime report is that we are in the low end compared to cities of larger, smaller and similar size.",107,,
944,0.97,6571.831,6577.904,So it tells us we're not vastly Overstaffed compared to similar cities.,107,,
945,0.97,6577.904,6579.406,We're not vastly Understaffed compared to similar cities.,107,,
946,0.97,6579.406,6582.075,But we are on the low end.,107,,
947,0.97,6582.075,6583.276,That's just the context.,107,,
948,0.97,6583.276,6591.818,We do I think as the question and points were made by several Council members the outset we don't rely on a tool.,107,,
949,0.97,6591.818,6596.723,We recognize all of those same constraints and problems.,107,,
950,0.97,6596.723,6601.728,I immediately as the Council President started quoting it I knew what document she was quoting from.,107,,
951,0.97,6601.728,6603.93,We use that document as well.,107,,
952,0.97,6603.93,6607.6,We use a variety of models.,107,,
953,0.97,6607.6,6610.37,We do use the managing patrol performance program.,107,,
954,0.97,6610.37,6612.305,Mpp as we call it.,107,,
955,0.97,6612.305,6614.441,Developed out of MIT.,107,,
956,0.97,6614.441,6620.613,That's been in use since around 1975.,107,,
957,0.97,6620.613,6630.89,"In reality an operations Queuing model that any agency could use to determine how long do I want my customer, my clients, the public to wait for the service.",107,,
958,0.97,6630.89,6633.827,You feed into that apply Kateed program.,107,,
959,0.97,6633.827,6635.261,It was developed a while ago.,107,,
960,0.97,6635.261,6641.901,They tried to make it more user friendly.,107,,
961,0.97,6641.901,6647.207,To Formatte data to feed in things like how long are you spending on each service call.,107,,
962,0.97,6647.207,6647.874,Whatever your service model is.,107,,
963,0.97,6647.874,6652.946,How many people have to be tied up for each of those calls from your resources.,107,,
964,0.97,6652.946,6656.683,How frequent do you have different types of calls.,107,,
965,0.97,6656.683,6659.586,How long if you have a mobile service unit as a police Department would.,107,,
966,0.97,6659.586,6663.59,How long does it take you on average to get to different types of calls.,107,,
967,0.97,6663.59,6665.992,How much land area do you have to cover.,107,,
968,0.97,6665.992,6668.995,How many units to you currently have assigned there.,107,,
969,0.97,6668.995,6676.269,"And sort of that incoming call rate per day, per hour blocks within the day.",107,,
970,0.97,6676.269,6681.975,"If these are your parameters, this is how long you will expect people to wait for each different type of call.",107,,
971,0.97,6682.042,6690.784,T's up to the police Department or any other Oughtsy that worries about how long people have to wait for service to adjust those parameters.,107,,
972,0.97,6690.784,6704.197,When we use that model as we've used throughout the years it changes different administrations have decided that different amounts of officer time should be quote Unquote free time.,107,,
973,0.97,6704.197,6706.533,To engage community.,107,,
974,0.97,6706.533,6708.835,To problem solve.,107,,
975,0.97,6708.835,6709.402,To build relationships.,107,,
976,0.97,6709.402,6713.74,Chief Diaz made it clear he would like that at the 40% range.,107,,
977,0.97,6713.74,6716.509,It's been lower because of staffing constraints.,107,,
978,0.97,6716.509,6723.149,That's a large reason why he pushed additional people into patrol.,107,,
979,0.97,6723.149,6732.058,The 60% then is time on calls and time handling administrative paperwork.,107,,
980,0.97,6732.058,6732.392,Getting gas.,107,,
981,0.97,6732.392,6732.826,Talking a Biobreak.,107,,
982,0.97,6732.826,6739.666,You build that in and model it out.,107,,
983,0.97,6739.666,6742.368,That doesn't always account for every reality.,107,,
984,0.97,6742.368,6744.971,It is not an exhaustive model.,107,,
985,0.97,6744.971,6748.274,There are operational realities that you have to layer into that.,107,,
986,0.97,6748.274,6758.084,"For us, you can some of it put into the model as the consent decree sort was fully sort of baked into how the Department does business.",107,,
987,0.97,6758.084,6760.453,In most cases there are no solo calls.,107,,
988,0.97,6760.453,6768.294,We don't send one officer to most calls for a variety of reasons recommended by the monitor in the court and experts.,107,,
989,0.97,6768.294,6771.698,So that increases the time until you're engaging the call.,107,,
990,0.97,6771.698,6773.266,We have to build that in.,107,,
991,0.97,6773.266,6783.409,We have span of control and unite of command issues that you build in to make sure you have the right number of sergeants and lieutenants and s & amp; P Visors.,107,,
992,0.97,6783.409,6790.517,The outside of patrol you have issues around squads and coverage and who has time off.,107,,
993,0.97,6790.517,6792.485,All that gets into this model.,107,,
994,0.97,6792.485,6796.656,We layer in the operational and it gives us an estimate.,107,,
995,0.97,6796.656,6798.091,We know that's one model.,107,,
996,0.97,6798.091,6803.93,We also use the Performance- based approach that Michigan state working with the cops office put out.,107,,
997,0.97,6803.93,6811.704,That one is easier for us to eliminate in terms of no change things around.,107,,
998,0.97,6811.704,6818.611,To predict what different parameters would do.,107,,
999,0.97,6818.611,6821.581,"If we change this, how many officers.",107,,
1000,0.97,6821.581,6824.417,What bowl the performance look like.,107,,
1001,0.97,6824.417,6825.718,If we change our goal performance time.,107,,
1002,0.97,6825.718,6832.258,If it we decided we were not going to have officer dispatch any more what bowl that do.,107,,
1003,0.97,6832.258,6833.893,It's easier for us to do that.,107,,
1004,0.97,6833.893,6841.835,In that model it's more of a broken down equation instead after computer program that takes formulated files.,107,,
1005,0.97,6841.835,6858.384,We also have looked at sort of what I would call back of the envelope because of that model being difficult to Rerun there were a few years are we did not have anybody with the time from an ANALYTICS standpoint to completely run that model.,107,,
1006,0.97,6858.384,6868.228,Our patrol commanders were looking at their daily call load and adjusting their minimum staffing.,107,,
1007,0.97,6868.228,6872.966,"As is the desire of most researchers and analysts, what we try to do is Triangulate.",107,,
1008,0.97,6872.966,6882.508,"As it happens to be, when you look at models from different perspectives they're in the same back to this analogy, we're into the same ballpark.",107,,
1009,0.97,6882.508,6890.049,I agree with Council President Gonzalez that the Berkshire report had questions about its ultimate utility.,107,,
1010,0.97,6890.049,6894.52,It also taking a different approach about how they looked at it.,107,,
1011,0.97,6894.52,6895.722,I wasn't here then either.,107,,
1012,0.97,6895.722,6906.099,They also ended up in about the same guideline for the amount of calls that in come in to 911 that offices are dispatched to.,107,,
1013,0.97,6906.099,6922.015,Úhow many people do we need to meet that 7 minute standard for priority 1 in progress emergency calls and then we do have other goals for the other priorities because that's not in progress.,107,,
1014,0.97,6922.015,6932.692,That's not an emergency we don't normally stress the 7 minute it's corollaries and the other priorities aren't quite as driven as in it priority one.,107,,
1015,0.97,6932.692,6937.797,"We do try to see, you know, are we able to hit those Metrics.",107,,
1016,0.97,6937.797,6938.898,Where are we not addressing it.,107,,
1017,0.97,6938.898,6943.67,Then we also look at how it plays out in reality.,107,,
1018,0.97,6943.67,6959.152,This year Covid I think presented a experiment that researchers across multiple fields will be studying and trying to understand for years to come about what it did to data and the system.,107,,
1019,0.97,6959.152,6967.393,This is before the civil rights uprising and all of the repercussions of that important community work.,107,,
1020,0.97,6967.393,6989.749,"Just in the few months where Covid had really restricted the calls that departments across the country were going to to try to limit that interpersonal contact to try to slow down any spread we were one of those departments as Moats large Údepartments and small departments did, we tried to push as much as we could to Online reporting and to telephone reporting.",107,,
1021,0.97,6989.749,6993.953,A lot of the recommendations from that guide.,107,,
1022,0.97,6993.953,7004.564,"What we still saw is we've that, yes you have to layer in we had additional people out because they were being Quarantined to make sure we slowed the spread.",107,,
1023,0.97,7004.564,7010.837,And they and their families were safe.,107,,
1024,0.97,7010.837,7021.781,Even with restricted dispatch events we were going to versus fielding through the phone or Online we were still having a augment based on our minimum staffing.,107,,
1025,0.97,7021.781,7026.886,That minimum staffing designed by a patrol commander.,107,,
1026,0.97,7026.886,7027.086,Mpp.,107,,
1027,0.97,7027.086,7028.221,By the Michigan state model.,107,,
1028,0.97,7028.221,7030.256,By a Triangulation of all three.,107,,
1029,0.97,7030.256,7030.656,It is a minimum.,107,,
1030,0.97,7030.656,7047.44,"This is how many people for that shift or watch nor that day in that Precinct, how many officers do you need to handle the call volume, to meet your response time goals and to have an officer be able to stay in their sector.",107,,
1031,0.97,7047.44,7050.543,To stay in their beat.,107,,
1032,0.97,7050.543,7051.244,Their neighborhood.,107,,
1033,0.97,7051.244,7059.585,When we have less officers than that minimum staffing we augment or if it they can't get enough people in there's one officer in a sector.,107,,
1034,0.97,7059.585,7066.192,They are having to dispatch across a sector.,107,,
1035,0.97,7066.192,7070.83,"Might not have sector, might not stick within their sector if they have to help out a colleague.",107,,
1036,0.97,7070.83,7096.556,That breaks up the idea of working with your community and knowing what's going on in your community if you're having to race across broader boundaries because there aren't enough folks deployed to get to the basic priority one and priority two calls which is what we were focusing on in Covid as sort of that natural experiment that happened by everyone changing their behaviors to slow the spread.,107,,
1037,0.97,7096.556,7097.59,That's what we look at.,107,,
1038,0.97,7097.59,7106.532,We'll get into the specifics in a second.,107,,
1039,0.97,7106.532,7109.769,As the chief mentioned there are some specialty units.,107,,
1040,0.97,7109.769,7113.005,There are some best practice guidelines.,107,,
1041,0.97,7113.005,7113.473,It's pretty limited.,107,,
1042,0.97,7113.473,7123.983,There hasn't for a variety of reasons been a ton of research on what are best practices in investigations.,107,,
1043,0.97,7123.983,7128.154,Homicide generally has some best practices around what is their case load.,107,,
1044,0.97,7128.154,7135.127,Really it's about people think they should take in maybe 4 to 6 new Homicide as year.,107,,
1045,0.97,7135.127,7143.336,"Each detective, our detectives in Homicide also handle our assaults and bias crimes so there is no magic number for that.",107,,
1046,0.97,7143.336,7146.973,We have to look at how many of those serious cases come in.,107,,
1047,0.97,7146.973,7149.275,How long does it take to solve them.,107,,
1048,0.97,7149.275,7153.079,How many of them get closed.,107,,
1049,0.97,7153.079,7156.415,And adjust that staffing as those trends change.,107,,
1050,0.97,7156.415,7162.221,We do have best practice Metrics on just specifically Homicide.,107,,
1051,0.97,7162.221,7164.891,We do have best practice Metrics on sexual assault.,107,,
1052,0.97,7164.891,7170.596,They're recommended to take anywhere from 2 to 8 new cases a month.,107,,
1053,0.97,7170.596,7173.9,And hold four at any one time.,107,,
1054,0.97,7173.9,7180.006,Those investigations are really two of the only places we have specific case load.,107,,
1055,0.97,7180.006,7187.58,"Anyone working that Internet crimes against children or trafficking, any of that Online sexual exploitation.",107,,
1056,0.97,7187.58,7192.351,There aren't case load guides but there are workload wellness guides.,107,,
1057,0.97,7192.351,7195.221,That brings with it some tremendous trauma.,107,,
1058,0.97,7195.221,7202.828,"Vicarious, if not direct from what they have to see to do their investigations.",107,,
1059,0.97,7202.828,7205.431,So there are workload guides around how often they need breaks.,107,,
1060,0.97,7205.431,7209.001,How often they should be cycled in and out.,107,,
1061,0.97,7209.001,7213.506,What their broadest case load should be but not really this many per month.,107,,
1062,0.97,7213.506,7229.188,"We have seen a dramatic Uptick in that reported not just in Seattle but nationally as we've had, you know, without school, without mandatory reporters we have seen a lot of increase in external reporting or noticing of Online exploitation.",107,,
1063,0.97,7229.188,7234.56,So that's always something we're watching.,107,,
1064,0.97,7234.56,7236.128,Very stressful and strange unit.,107,,
1065,0.97,7236.128,7239.065,"Other specialty functions like the special, the swath team.",107,,
1066,0.97,7239.065,7243.369,There are guidelines from national security from the urban area security initiative.,107,,
1067,0.97,7243.369,7254.38,We get a lot of funding as a city and region to protect the port.,107,,
1068,0.97,7254.38,7259.252,There are guidelines how many people you should have in that sort of unit.,107,,
1069,0.97,7259.252,7264.857,That's what we think about when we try to start Piecing together how many do each of these areas need.,107,,
1070,0.97,7264.857,7268.794,"Angela, if you want to skip ahead.",107,,
1071,0.97,7268.794,7271.063,So then we add it up.,107,,
1072,0.97,7271.063,7291.05,"When we run that Triangulation for patrol we end up when you do officers, when you do sergeants, lieutenants, captains, bike officers, West precinct downtown, parts of North Precinct, parts of the East precinct benefit, especially at certain times a day a lot from having officers out on bikes.",107,,
1073,0.97,7291.05,7291.851,They're more approachable.,107,,
1074,0.97,7291.851,7296.689,"When we have traffic, which one day will return.",107,,
1075,0.97,7296.689,7299.292,Smug I think we all oddly Miss.,107,,
1076,0.97,7299.292,7300.126,The bikes get there faster.,107,,
1077,0.97,7300.126,7306.932,When you add all that together that comes up to about 745 offices in patrol to meet our current workload.,107,,
1078,0.97,7306.932,7308.2,We are not there now.,107,,
1079,0.97,7308.2,7312.471,The chief was driving for that with his reallocation.,107,,
1080,0.97,7312.471,7315.541,We're going to see sort of stress testing this.,107,,
1081,0.97,7315.541,7316.108,These are all models.,107,,
1082,0.97,7316.108,7321.614,You do need to see how does it play out in reality.,107,,
1083,0.97,7321.614,7331.691,"We also then, we do have those extra positions because we do not specifically as an organization or as a city fund our recruits and student officers.",107,,
1084,0.97,7331.691,7335.594,They are funded out of unoccupied patrol positions.,107,,
1085,0.97,7335.594,7350.076,At any one time we can have anywhere from 80 to 100 students and recruits and so we do leave patrol positions open to make sure we pay those individuals for their time getting trained.,107,,
1086,0.97,7350.076,7358.551,Then that leaves us if you take away the 745 and the 100 that leaves you with about 555 officers to fill out everything else we do.,107,,
1087,0.97,7358.551,7364.623,We sort of then just go down in descending order based on where do we know we have guides about how many we need.,107,,
1088,0.97,7364.623,7372.098,Back to that Homicide and sexual assault and the other specialty detective units and their workload.,107,,
1089,0.97,7372.098,7375.968,"We figure out we need around, you know, I'm not going to go through each number on here.",107,,
1090,0.97,7375.968,7387.613,"You see how many we calculate we need incremental investigations, special operations, you know, that's the S.W.A.T.",107,,
1091,0.97,7387.613,7389.415,"Team, traffic, harbor, arson bombs.",107,,
1092,0.97,7389.415,7390.85,They've had a busy year.,107,,
1093,0.97,7390.85,7395.521,Sometimes you can't anticipate that you'll have a busy year.,107,,
1094,0.97,7395.521,7401.227,That's why we sometimes do on loans if a unit is getting overwhelmed.,107,,
1095,0.97,7401.227,7402.128,Professional standards increased a lot.,107,,
1096,0.97,7402.128,7405.03,We had to increase our Trainers.,107,,
1097,0.97,7405.03,7408.634,"We've done a lot, you've heard us reference the five times the training.",107,,
1098,0.97,7408.634,7414.907,That's where our force investigation teams are.,107,,
1099,0.97,7414.907,7416.942,Collaborative policing.,107,,
1100,0.97,7416.942,7422.248,You see the smaller where there are few other folks.,107,,
1101,0.97,7422.248,7428.454,The chief operating officer direct Lashup Vises the sworn officers required to sign up and take those Online and telephone reports.,107,,
1102,0.97,7428.454,7431.524,That's where most of that number is.,107,,
1103,0.97,7431.524,7434.827,"So that, we add all those together.",107,,
1104,0.97,7434.827,7444.336,That's how we get to the number and I believe then that moves us to Angela to finish out some of the specific budget actions.,107,,
1105,0.97,7444.336,7445.07,Thank you.,108,,
1106,0.97,7445.07,7447.206,I am just going to pause here very briefly.,108,,
1107,0.97,7447.206,7465.858,"I do want folks to continue to hold their questions but given that the last three slides were just specific to item number one on your chart, I don't want those concerns that were also raised earlier to go unanswered as we then have more of the chart to go through.",108,,
1108,0.97,7465.858,7476.469,So very briefly I'm going to pause and see if there's any questions here on item number one as articulated in the last three slides.,108,,
1109,0.97,7476.469,7476.669,Okay.,108,,
1110,0.97,7476.669,7479.205,"Sorry, did I see your hand could be sill President?",108,,
1111,0.97,7479.205,7488.214,"Yeah, I do have a--just so I'm clear you're asking for questions on the sworn staffing portions of the presentation?",109,,
1112,0.97,7488.214,7489.481,That's right.,110,,
1113,0.97,7489.481,7497.323,"So we're looking at the have slides 3, which have backup slides on 4, 5 and 6.",110,,
1114,0.97,7497.323,7497.623,Right.,111,,
1115,0.97,7497.623,7500.693,I do have some questions around these particular issues.,111,,
1116,0.97,7500.693,7520.813,"So just really quickly when you look at slide number 5. um, Yeah, I think and frankly this is true for all the slides.",111,,
1117,0.97,7520.813,7541.033,"4, 5. I think what I heard were some remarks about you know if we go below these levels than we have to sort of live with the realities of the service.",111,,
1118,0.97,7541.033,7550.009,The information being provided to us presume no reductions to the police Department's scope of work.,111,,
1119,0.97,7550.009,7550.409,Is that correct?,111,,
1120,0.97,7550.409,7552.444,They assume no reduction.,112,,
1121,0.97,7552.444,7563.389,This is sort of to the conversation Council member Herbold brought up about we don't assume any reductions starting January 1.,112,,
1122,0.97,7563.389,7574.166,So this assumes that the police Department will continue to have the existing scope of work that it has now.,113,,
1123,0.97,7574.166,7574.466,Correct.,114,,
1124,0.97,7574.466,7587.947,We anticipate it'll take some time to figure out what can be safely shifted to alternative responses and to build that capacity.,114,,
1125,0.97,7587.947,7588.547,Then we could adjust.,114,,
1126,0.97,7588.547,7597.556,We want to be ready on January 1 for the call volume we anticipate wouldn't change until that work was done.,114,,
1127,0.97,7597.556,7598.023,Okay.,115,,
1128,0.97,7598.023,7609.868,"In terms of the information related to sworn officers, I'm going to quickly go through what I think I'm seeing here.",115,,
1129,0.97,7609.868,7617.076,In terms of what we adopted in 2020 and what is proposed in 2021.,115,,
1130,0.97,7617.076,7626.552,It's more for clarity's sake because there's a lot of graphs and charts and bullet points.,115,,
1131,0.97,7626.552,7627.987,If you'll indulge me here.,115,,
1132,0.97,7627.987,7640.699,"My understanding is the 2020 adopted budget included 1,497 sworn officer positions.",115,,
1133,0.97,7640.699,7649.641,"So total Ftes for 2020 adopted budget was 1,497.",115,,
1134,0.97,7649.641,7652.011,Is that accurate?,115,,
1135,0.97,7652.011,7652.945,That's correct.,116,,
1136,0.97,7652.945,7653.145,Yeah.,116,,
1137,0.97,7653.145,7653.412,Okay.,117,,
1138,0.97,7653.412,7674.299,"But the 2020 adopted budget only funded 1,422 of those sworn officer positions, leaving 75 positions in 2020 unfunded and vacant.",117,,
1139,0.97,7674.299,7674.566,Correct?,117,,
1140,0.97,7674.566,7675.534,That's correct.,118,,
1141,0.97,7675.534,7675.768,Yeah.,118,,
1142,0.97,7675.768,7709.902,"So then in 2021, proposed budget we see a proposal for an Agreation of a total of 47 full time equivalent positions for sworn officers which would then result in it a decrease of 1,450 positions that would be granted to the Seattle police Department.",119,,
1143,0.97,7709.902,7715.607,"The 47 goes from 1497 to 1450 authorized positions, 1400 of which are funded.",120,,
1144,0.97,7715.607,7715.974,Okay.,121,,
1145,0.97,7715.974,7719.678,That was going to be my last question.,121,,
1146,0.97,7719.678,7746.872,"So the 2021 proposed budget then appears to fund 1400 positions which is only 22 less than 2020, but there are still 50 positions authorized positions, there's 1450 authorized positions in the 2021 proposed budget.",121,,
1147,0.97,7746.872,7747.773,That's correct.,122,,
1148,0.97,7747.773,7747.973,Yeah.,122,,
1149,0.97,7747.973,7762.721,We retain 50 unfunded officer positions in the 2021 proposed budget with the intent of pending the results of the work that's being done as part of Idt.,122,,
1150,0.97,7762.721,7763.489,Okay.,123,,
1151,0.97,7763.489,7786.612,"And can you please explain both the data analysis and the policy rationale for funding precisely 1400 sworn officer positions and leaving, but leaving 1450 authorized positions on the books?",123,,
1152,0.97,7786.612,7787.88,"Yeah, if you could just.",123,,
1153,0.97,7787.88,7807.032,I'm trying to understand the policy rationale for that Delta of 1400 versus 1450.,123,,
1154,0.97,7807.032,7810.769,That makes sense to me.,124,,
1155,0.97,7810.769,7811.236,Thank you.,124,,
1156,0.97,7811.236,7811.47,Angela.,124,,
1157,0.97,7811.47,7811.737,Yeah.,125,,
1158,0.97,7811.737,7815.908,So I would think of this more as a reserve.,125,,
1159,0.97,7815.908,7822.948,We were reluctant to cut all of those positions until we knew the results of the on going work.,125,,
1160,0.97,7822.948,7831.79,There is the police Department's position on where our staffing should be.,125,,
1161,0.97,7831.79,7837.563,There's the Council's position potentially many different positions on where our staffing should be.,125,,
1162,0.97,7837.563,7844.837,This is all subject to continued discussion and collaboration on what the final number should be.,125,,
1163,0.97,7844.837,7848.24,It seemed inconsequential to leave positions that couldn't be filled either way.,125,,
1164,0.97,7848.24,7853.278,We don't have sufficient budget for those.,125,,
1165,0.97,7853.278,7853.879,But the positions remain.,125,,
1166,0.97,7853.879,7865.39,"No action is planned for those positions until we can, until we determine what the resulting, determine the results of the 2021 budget process.",125,,
1167,0.97,7865.39,7873.966,"So Angela, help me understand that.",126,,
1168,0.97,7873.966,7891.083,"If 14--if the 50 positions that are authorized were funded, how much money, what's the dollar amount assigned to those 50 positions?",126,,
1169,0.97,7891.083,7895.22,For the 50.,127,,
1170,0.97,7895.22,7899.791,"Sorry, just give me one moment.",127,,
1171,0.97,7899.791,7908.6,"It's around $7 million that was, is attributable to those 50 positions.",127,,
1172,0.97,7908.6,7917.776,So those 50 positions that are authorized but currently unfunded are worth $7 million?,128,,
1173,0.97,7917.776,7918.71,Correct.,129,,
1174,0.97,7918.71,7918.977,Roughly.,129,,
1175,0.97,7918.977,7919.177,Yeah.,129,,
1176,0.97,7919.177,7919.478,Quick math.,129,,
1177,0.97,7919.478,7920.012,But that's the ballpark.,129,,
1178,0.97,7920.012,7921.88,Your math is going to be better than mine.,130,,
1179,0.97,7921.88,7928.42,That's why I'm asking you the questions.,130,,
1180,0.97,7928.42,7928.82,I appreciate it.,130,,
1181,0.97,7928.82,7963.388,"And um, and so you're saying that the reason there isn't a complete aggregation of those 97 positions, you're saying that the reason there isn't a great aggregation is because it may be impacted by the Idt work that is going to be launched by the Durkan administration.",130,,
1182,0.97,7963.388,7966.058,I should say that's my assumption.,131,,
1183,0.97,7966.058,7974.966,"As far as, you know, going into the budget we didn't propose.",131,,
1184,0.97,7974.966,7993.318,"The department didn't propose the positions of the 47 and then the, you know, made the decision to leave the 50.",131,,
1185,0.97,7993.318,8006.064,"It, I would say it's because they are unfunded, you know, to be completely honest I haven't given much consideration to those.",131,,
1186,0.97,8006.064,8012.738,We established the need on the basis of maintaining the status quo.,131,,
1187,0.97,8012.738,8026.718,We identified 1400 positions the Delta between the positions that were Aggregated and the positions we were advocating for happened to be 50.,131,,
1188,0.97,8026.718,8049.775,"That may sound that it was an Afterthought, but that, I haven't heard any clear necessarily policy position on why the 50 were left, why they, you know, why they remain other than reserving some flexibility for us to make determinations around what the appropriate size of the police Department is.",131,,
1189,0.97,8049.775,8063.422,I think the inference it creates is that there could--that the Idt could come out with a recommendation that we should grow the police force and that's why the 50 positions should be Aggregated.,132,,
1190,0.97,8063.422,8067.292,Is that one of the potential outcomes?,132,,
1191,0.97,8067.292,8070.495,I can absolutely see how you could make that inference.,133,,
1192,0.97,8070.495,8077.803,I can't speak to whether or not that was the intent of leaving the 50.,133,,
1193,0.97,8077.803,8080.572,It wasn't my change request that was developed.,133,,
1194,0.97,8080.572,8087.846,I don't want to speak on behalf of the executive and how that came to be.,133,,
1195,0.97,8087.846,8093.618,But I would say that is a fair inference.,133,,
1196,0.97,8093.618,8118.643,"Could, and I just want to be really clear that if the, if the city council decided to eliminate the 50 position, the 50 additional authorized but unfunded positions, that would not have any budget implications on the police Department; is that correct?",134,,
1197,0.97,8118.643,8128.887,If the additional 50 were Aggregated there would be no effect to our staffing.,135,,
1198,0.97,8128.887,8133.358,There wouldn't necessarily be additional budget savings and it shouldn't have operational impact.,135,,
1199,0.97,8133.358,8154.045,S one thing I will point out as Chris mentioned our student officers and our recruits are not funded so a portion of the 1400 goes towards around 80 to 100 positions go towards our occupied by those recruits and student officers who are not deployable.,135,,
1200,0.97,8154.045,8154.613,That is a factor here.,135,,
1201,0.97,8154.613,8170.362,"And as far as the budget goes, all of our positions are, the funded level is in the budget for all of our positions is pro rated based on anticipated attrition and hiring.",135,,
1202,0.97,8170.362,8182.34,But you're not saying that the 80 to 100 Trainee positions for lack of a better term are captured by the 50 unfunded.,136,,
1203,0.97,8182.34,8182.607,No.,137,,
1204,0.97,8182.607,8184.409,"Unauthorized, unfunded positions.",138,,
1205,0.97,8184.409,8186.211,"No, no, no.",139,,
1206,0.97,8186.211,8186.478,Sorry.,139,,
1207,0.97,8186.478,8187.112,That was probably confusing.,139,,
1208,0.97,8187.112,8189.314,We're creating a little bit of confusion there.,140,,
1209,0.97,8189.314,8203.828,"Want to be really clear that the issue with regard to recruits, that is included in the base number of 1400 sworn officers that's baked into the staffing model.",140,,
1210,0.97,8203.828,8205.263,That's correct.,141,,
1211,0.97,8205.263,8205.897,Yeah.,141,,
1212,0.97,8205.897,8206.531,So I'm very.,141,,
1213,0.97,8206.531,8227.218,"We're talking about 50 additional positions that are included in this Mayor's proposed 2021 budget that are basically being held, preserved, even though there are no real dollars attached to them.",142,,
1214,0.97,8227.218,8245.904,The possibility of some day funding those positions is preserved by virtue of not aggregating those authorized but unfunded slots for sworn officer positions.,142,,
1215,0.97,8245.904,8246.204,Uh-huh.,143,,
1216,0.97,8246.204,8246.671,Is that correct?,144,,
1217,0.97,8246.671,8247.472,If I might.,145,,
1218,0.97,8247.472,8249.307,"Go ahead, Ben.",146,,
1219,0.97,8249.307,8256.581,Consistent with the discussions we've had over the past few weeks as we were working on issues related to SPD and budget.,147,,
1220,0.97,8256.581,8260.619,These vacant positions are not essential to the budget and can be eliminated.,147,,
1221,0.97,8260.619,8271.963,There is a very long bureaucratic pros involved with creating positions that may have been the reason to provide to avoid eliminating them all.,147,,
1222,0.97,8271.963,8279.337,"Again, we separately communicated they're not essential and we don't expect and won't have resources to hire into them.",147,,
1223,0.97,8279.337,8286.311,"So honestly, a Nonissue at some level and I only say that because there are really important issues for us to work on.",147,,
1224,0.97,8286.311,8291.049,But also recognize that it's important for you to clarify the expectations on that point.,147,,
1225,0.97,8291.049,8295.687,I'm not trying to Trivialize it.,147,,
1226,0.97,8295.687,8298.356,"I don't think it's a major point, if it you will.",147,,
1227,0.97,8298.356,8302.761,But I recognize the position of authority is an important aspect of the budgeting process overall.,147,,
1228,0.97,8302.761,8308.199,"Thank you for saying you're not trying to Trivializing while Trivializing it, Dr.",148,,
1229,0.97,8308.199,8308.433,Noble.,148,,
1230,0.97,8308.433,8313.305,I'm going to finish my line of questioning here.,148,,
1231,0.97,8313.305,8326.251,I just want to be really clear that these additional 50 positions don't have any service.,148,,
1232,0.97,8326.251,8333.158,There would not be service impacts or budget impacts one way or the other.,148,,
1233,0.97,8333.158,8334.125,That is correct.,149,,
1234,0.97,8334.125,8334.359,Yeah.,149,,
1235,0.97,8334.359,8343.935,"We, these were, these same positions were included in this the compromised bill.",149,,
1236,0.97,8343.935,8347.138,We were fully prepared to relinquish those positions.,149,,
1237,0.97,8347.138,8357.015,I recognize they were included in the compromise bill but they were not included in the proposed budget as transmitted by the Mayor; correct?,150,,
1238,0.97,8357.015,8357.282,Yeah.,151,,
1239,0.97,8357.282,8367.125,The budget had already been drafted.,151,,
1240,0.97,8367.125,8371.396,Really quickly on the issue of the staffing models again.,152,,
1241,0.97,8371.396,8395.787,I understand that the proposed budget and staffing model projects new recruitment and hiring activities in 2021 based on just my initial review of the presentation and the documents.,152,,
1242,0.97,8395.787,8429.02,"My reading of the proposed budget here and the staffing model projections is that there will be additional recruitment and hiring activities in 2021 and I'm, and if that is true, then I would like to get an understanding of how to reconcile those recruitment and hiring activities proposed for 2021 with the plans to Reimagine public safety and begin the process of shifting to harm reduction community models of safety.",152,,
1243,0.97,8429.02,8432.757,"That might not be a question for you, Angela.",152,,
1244,0.97,8432.757,8438.329,"But I'm, whoever from SPD or the city budget office wants to answer is fine.",152,,
1245,0.97,8438.329,8442.467,I can take a swing at it.,153,,
1246,0.97,8442.467,8457.682,"To circle back to some of the chief's points, at this point there are a lot of unknowns around what, you know, what a Reenvisioned police Department is going to look like.",153,,
1247,0.97,8457.682,8463.721,Right now we are concerned at the rate in which we are losing sworn police officers.,153,,
1248,0.97,8463.721,8469.727,We have had a hiring freeze in place since mid 2020.,153,,
1249,0.97,8469.727,8479.003,And as we continue to separate employees that 1400 number that we're currently staffed at is going to continue to decrease.,153,,
1250,0.97,8479.003,8488.813,"Leaving us in a situation where we're, we are operating at potentially much less than that.",153,,
1251,0.97,8488.813,8503.461,"Going into 2021 if we're talking about the maintenance of current service levels the 1400 is needed and that's going to require us to recruit, hire and train new police candidates.",153,,
1252,0.97,8503.461,8515.406,"That said, I mean if depending on the expediency at which we can establish alternatives and, you know, perhaps that's not necessary.",153,,
1253,0.97,8515.406,8521.746,At this point we don't know what it's going to look like.,153,,
1254,0.97,8521.746,8528.353,With that level of uncertainty we feel it's prudent to back fill for some of the attrition.,153,,
1255,0.97,8528.353,8532.257,We're not talking about growing the police Department in 2021.,153,,
1256,0.97,8532.257,8538.796,What the staffing model Depicts and what's included is purely the maintenance of our current staffing level.,153,,
1257,0.97,8538.796,8554.646,So how many of the 1400 positions are assumed to be necessary for back filling of attrition?,154,,
1258,0.97,8556.114,8572.063,"So as far as, I mean, so you're asking how many we would need to hire in order to back fill for attrition?",155,,
1259,0.97,8572.063,8572.764,Sorry.,156,,
1260,0.97,8572.764,8581.639,"I heard you say that the, that this project does propose recruitment and hiring activities in 2021.",156,,
1261,0.97,8581.639,8590.515,"However, those activities will be limited to back filling for the anticipated attrition.",156,,
1262,0.97,8590.515,8594.585,With the understanding that the ceiling will be 1400.,156,,
1263,0.97,8594.585,8600.325,So you will not be hiring more than 1400 in any situation.,156,,
1264,0.97,8600.325,8608.333,So of the 1400 sworn officers that are proposed to be funded in the 2021 budget.,156,,
1265,0.97,8608.333,8634.559,How many of those 1400 positions are assumed will be for purposes of back filling for back filling attrition.,156,,
1266,0.97,8634.559,8639.63,We're anticipating around 80 separations next year of fully trained officers.,157,,
1267,0.97,8639.63,8648.606,"If we were to hire we always build in a buffer for about, you know, for a handful of recruits and student officers to separate as well.",157,,
1268,0.97,8648.606,8659.751,"We would have to hire, we would have to back fill for about 90 separating employees in order to maintain our 1400.",157,,
1269,0.97,8659.751,8663.554,That staffing level of that 1400.,157,,
1270,0.97,8663.554,8663.921,Thank you.,158,,
1271,0.97,8663.921,8664.322,That's helpful.,158,,
1272,0.97,8664.322,8670.962,And that doesn't account for the separations that we'll continue to experience.,159,,
1273,0.97,8670.962,8675.9,"Again, we're currently at 1400 through the remaining three months of the year.",159,,
1274,0.97,8675.9,8680.772,I anticipate we will continue to lose officers and so that will certainly be a factor.,159,,
1275,0.97,8680.772,8686.844,We've tried to account for that in the staffing model.,159,,
1276,0.97,8686.844,8689.747,"Again, it is, you know, we do our best to anticipate what attrition is.",159,,
1277,0.97,8745.503,8753.377,In order to identify if there is the potential for any additional savings that could be realized through that exercise.,159,,
1278,0.97,8753.377,8756.08,So I appreciate your willingness to answer those questions.,159,,
1279,0.97,8756.08,8776.601,"I know we've all been talking a lot about the staffing model issues and I'm sure there will be some additional questions from my colleagues and additional questions and follow up and again I appreciate your, your, your answers to my questions here.",159,,
1280,0.97,8776.601,8776.934,Thank you.,159,,
1281,0.97,8776.934,8788.112,If I could just quickly add some policy connect for the Council President on this point.,160,,
1282,0.97,8788.112,8795.219,We think it's important to continue the influx of new officers as the recruits in past years have been far more diverse.,160,,
1283,0.97,8795.219,8798.156,"We want to continue that influx of new, younger, diverse officers as well.",160,,
1284,0.97,8798.156,8804.729,That's a little bit of a policy perspective behind our desire to keep hiring as well.,160,,
1285,0.97,8804.729,8810.001,You might want to introduce yourself for the record since I don't think you had an opportunity to do that.,161,,
1286,0.97,8810.001,8816.641,So that viewing members of the public and maybe some of my colleagues would benefit from that context.,161,,

1299,0.97,8919.343,8933.057,When I talked to chief Diaz couple days ago he confirmed for me we have not yet reached the 92 numbers . But we do expect to exceed it.,163,,

1301,0.97,8943.634,8944.969,In the context.,163,,
1302,0.97,8944.969,8949.674,I know this cannot be exact.,163,,
1303,0.97,8949.674,8958.549,"But I've asked for and I would still like, a revised 2020 estimate for separations this year.",163,,

1320,0.97,9125.015,9128.652,I think there is a misunderstanding.,163,,
1321,0.97,9128.652,9136.76,"I don't think it will be technically necessary, Interfund loans, don't have specific balance in the funds that will be called upon.",163,,
1322,0.97,9136.76,9144.068,"The expectation that we will, he indicated in the presentation yesterday, there is a fund balance leaving 2020 West.",163,,
1323,0.97,9144.068,9151.175,"Given that, we may not, we don't technically need the Interfund loan.",163,,
1324,0.97,9151.175,9157.882,It comes down to a question of what share of the $14 million to use got to get out the door by the end of the year.,163,,
1325,0.97,9157.882,9166.19,The intent is to move forward with this Rfp process . As we speak.,163,,
1326,0.97,9166.19,9178.002,"And issue it, whether we are able to complete all of it and make the origin, a Reimbursable basis.",163,,
1327,0.97,9178.002,9185.309,I tell you this to understand the inner forearm look loan piece expectation is to move forward.,163,,
1328,0.97,9185.309,9197.721,"What I have to say cut the budget for 2021 doesn't anticipate that we submitted you, it doesn't anticipate paying the loan . or repaint doesn't anticipate the cost.",163,,
1329,0.97,9197.721,9203.827,"So if we use the fund balance in 2020, the 2021 budget, we submitted to you will be out of balance.",163,,
1330,0.97,9203.827,9211.335,Council indicated the intent was to find the savings in 2021 to repay the costs.,163,,
1331,0.97,9211.335,9212.136,That would still be necessary.,163,,
1332,0.97,9212.136,9218.042,That is entirely the Purview of Council and appropriate to the context of the budget and the work you are doing.,163,,
1333,0.97,9218.042,9230.621,"So we are taking as directed if you will, in a positive sense, moving forward, that will reduce total resources available for 2021 and require some reductions and adjustments accordingly.",163,,
1334,0.97,9230.621,9238.562,"And we will be able to tell you, or provide an estimate of how much we expect to get out.",163,,
1335,0.97,9238.562,9243.434,Also ultimately $24 million and it's not spent in 2020 it is spent in 2021.,163,,
1336,0.97,9243.434,9245.236,"That is expectation, faster moving forward.",163,,
1337,0.97,9245.236,9248.872,Thank you director.,164,,
1338,0.97,9248.872,9255.779,"Councilmember Herbold, a follow-up question or comment?",164,,
1339,0.97,9255.779,9266.19,"I'm I'm good, I may have a follow-up question as I MULL over the budget director's response but I appreciate that thank you very much, Councilmember Morales I will follow-up if you would give me the grace on section.",164,,
1340,0.97,9266.19,9274.298,"I just want to make sure I understand the answer you provided, I appreciate the clarification.",164,,
1341,0.97,9274.298,9279.403,In my conversations with America my understanding was the use of the Interfund loan was not problematic.,164,,
1342,0.97,9279.403,9304.528,"Prior to last week . and I guess my question is, it doesn't sound like there is an objection to spending the 14 million it sounds like there was a commitment to spending at least four and the remaining 10 million that was concerning, as Councilmembers were Articulating, our concern was the 10 million was not actually going to be allocated.",164,,
1343,0.97,9304.528,9309.833,Are you saying it will be allocated by the concern is around process for the Rfp and how quickly it can be done?,164,,
1344,0.97,9309.833,9318.542,"The $4 million intent, as I understand, his existing contractors.",164,,
1345,0.97,9318.542,9321.445,We have agencies in the space.,164,,
1346,0.97,9321.445,9323.514,We can move forward with that quickly.,164,,
1347,0.97,9323.514,9331.422,"The $10 million we were awarded by an Rfp cut Rfp is being developed and will be issued, sometimes for folks to respond.",164,,
1348,0.97,9331.422,9339.329,It is just a question of whether that will all happen by year end.,164,,
1349,0.97,9339.329,9342.566,"Likely cut the decision-making, whether the dollars are spent by ear and.",164,,
1350,0.97,9342.566,9348.072,"It's an open question, not for lack of interest.",164,,
1351,0.97,9348.072,9351.875,"And Interfund loan, is a technical one.",164,,
1352,0.97,9351.875,9358.982,"We do not need the money, do all $14 million, are they available this year?",164,,
1353,0.97,9358.982,9360.484,Are they spent this year?,164,,
1354,0.97,9360.484,9371.195,"We have some cash reserves, as I indicated in the presentation yesterday, given the cash is reserves exist we may not need to do the Interfund loan.",164,,
1355,0.97,9371.195,9378.702,"That is not the critical policy issue, the critical policy issue is we will move forward quickly on the $4 million.",164,,
1356,0.97,9378.702,9382.806,This is the processing that we can move quickly on that.,164,,
1357,0.97,9382.806,9387.811,We initiated Rfp process for the $10 million and we will do that Expediently.,164,,
1358,0.97,9387.811,9393.117,To be careful will take a certain amount of time.,164,,
1359,0.97,9393.117,9399.223,"Yesterday we did have a conversation, trying to clarify the Council had not spent down all the Reserve funds.",165,,
1360,0.97,9399.223,9413.704,"I think this is an important policy decision we made to use the Interfund loan recognizing the money was not being used and was not going to put other infrastructure projects in jeopardy, that would allow us to maintain dollars in the reserve.",165,,
1361,0.97,9413.704,9427.251,"I will follow-up with you, and Councilmember Herbold who asked the question cut to confirm moving forward with the $10 million is pop as possible.",165,,
1362,0.97,9427.251,9444.368,"I think it gets to the executive director's comments earlier, about why the 1400 positions had been maintain with the assumption that community organizations couldn't get scaled up in the dollars were not going out the door.",165,,
1363,0.97,9444.368,9455.746,"If we can get the dollars out the door and begin Scaling up, we can realize more of the reductions or savings as Councilmember Herbold alluded to in the budget and that can be reflected in the 2020 budget.",165,,
1364,0.97,9455.746,9461.652,Councilmember Morales to wrap us up on this first item and then we'll get through the rest of the chart.,165,,
1365,0.97,9461.652,9467.491,I am looking at slide four.,166,,
1366,0.97,9467.491,9469.393,If we could go back just a minute.,166,,
1367,0.97,9469.393,9473.363,I want to make sure I am understanding the point you are trying to make here.,166,,
1368,0.97,9473.363,9484.908,"I know, while the Ftes may have increased by 5%, the overall budget has increased in the last five years by 36% or so.",166,,
1369,0.97,9484.908,9490.681,"Even though, which is substantially greater than our population growth.",166,,
1370,0.97,9490.681,9497.921,I want to make sure I understand that with more specificity where the increase is coming from.,166,,
1371,0.97,9497.921,9504.695,"Is it just officer pay, overtime, the equipment, growth, over the last five or 10 years.",166,,
1372,0.97,9504.695,9508.632,If you could address that for me please.,166,,
1373,0.97,9508.632,9519.776,"I would say, I didn't want to draw any conclusions from this year you're absolutely right our budget has increased at a greater percentage than the population.",167,,
1374,0.97,9519.776,9537.961,"What I've heard mentioned multiple times now, there is this correlation made between the number of police officers we have had or how the number has grown over time.",167,,
1375,0.97,9537.961,9552.776,And then it is measured against the crime statistics and whether crime has gone up or down and try to make a correlation between the existence of a certain number of police officers and how that may or may not impact crime.,167,,
1376,0.97,9552.776,9563.353,"As far as the budget increase goes, the large majority of that will be attributable to the cost of our personnel.",167,,
1377,0.97,9563.353,9568.392,This contract that was signed at the end of 2018.,167,,
1378,0.97,9568.392,9574.498,"It increased, included annual wage increases, up to 16%.",167,,
1379,0.97,9574.498,9580.671,The cost of our officers increase by 16% over that period of time.,167,,
1380,0.97,9580.671,9585.075,"The Awi continued, each year there was an increase.",167,,
1381,0.97,9585.075,9590.18,Additional increases.,167,,
1382,0.97,9590.18,9594.618,"And so, that is the primary factor for the budget increase, along with that, please",167,,
1383,0.97,9594.618,9596.887,I'm sorry can I stop you for a minute.,168,,
1384,0.97,9596.887,9599.723,Did you say every year we go up 16%?,168,,
1385,0.97,9599.723,9602.125,"No, sorry that was a cumulative increase.",169,,
1386,0.97,9602.125,9607.631,The contract signing was delayed.,169,,
1387,0.97,9607.631,9609.433,We had an expired contract for many years.,169,,
1388,0.97,9609.433,9621.044,"There was a lump sum payment for the Retro, for that 16%, and going forward, we got onto the regular cadence of the annual wage increases which is standard.",169,,
1389,0.97,9621.044,9638.328,"So you will see within the increase, the increased cost of infrastructure costs, the need for you know, our equipment budget hasn't actually increased significantly over that Timeframe.",169,,
1390,0.97,9638.328,9640.964,It is a small portion of our budget.,169,,
1391,0.97,9640.964,9655.746,"I will be more than happy to provide additional explanations, but the main answer, the main reason will be the significant increase in the cost of a police officer.",169,,
1392,0.97,9655.746,9660.684,Councilmember Mariah Ellis did that answer your question?,170,,
1393,0.97,9660.684,9671.795,"Reporter: I understand you about clarifying point to make Chris and I do account with regards to the processor on the 14 million, I was reminded by my staff, Adam Shaver thank you.",171,,
1394,0.97,9671.795,9677.3,"There is a proviso, on that $10 million.",171,,
1395,0.97,9677.3,9692.382,"Once you move through the Rfp process, we need to discuss with you at what point in the word process you want to provide the additional legal authority to move forward with the spending of the money.",171,,
1396,0.97,9692.382,9695.619,As written it requires an additional ordinance.,171,,
1397,0.97,9695.619,9698.288,I want to acknowledge that we need to Chordate on that.,171,,
1398,0.97,9698.288,9707.397,"I would understand better what level if information, we can run with Rfp process and bring a potential list of Awardees or something.",171,,
1399,0.97,9707.397,9712.803,"He doesn't have to slow us down, I just need, I want to remind you about that key step.",171,,

1431,0.97,9942.465,9948.071,While SPD cooperated in the development of the request they didn't necessarily originate.,176,,
1432,0.97,9948.071,9949.472,It was a collaborative effort.,176,,
1433,0.97,9949.472,9951.941,I would say it mostly driven by the Mayor's office.,176,,
1434,0.97,9951.941,9962.986,I will walk through each of these but feel free to raise any questions you have.,176,,

1438,0.97,9989.713,10011.034,"I believe it is a two or Three- year average that was used to establish that budget transfer amount . There is an understanding between SPD, Sdot and the special events office we will work together to figure out how to coordinate the appointment of parking enforcement to events that are staffed by SPD.",176,,
1439,0.97,10011.034,10027.35,"This topic is included as part of the, we have planned a future analysis on how, as a city that we can better staff special events.",176,,

1496,0.97,10431.12,10433.556,"Yes, sure, thank you.",182,,
1497,0.97,10433.556,10434.957,I've a question on slide 10.,182,,
1498,0.97,10434.957,10443.533,"I just want to make sure, on item number eight, I understand the logic here.",182,,
1499,0.97,10443.533,10452.875,"It says there has been an exponential increase in complaints against SPD . and therefore, we have to hire another investigator and spend more money to investigate SPD.",182,,
1500,0.97,10452.875,10455.278,And that should go and SPD's budget.,182,,
1501,0.97,10455.278,10459.682,Is that what I am to understand about that item?,182,,
1502,0.97,10459.682,10467.056,The Office of police accountability is embedded in SPD currently.,183,,
1503,0.97,10467.056,10480.069,"The operating, I describe it I believe there is legislation that describes in the same manner as a budget Island.",183,,
1504,0.97,10480.069,10481.103,We don't necessarily transfer money for,183,,
1505,0.97,10481.103,10482.104,I understand that.,184,,
1506,0.97,10482.104,10488.611,"The point I am making, there's been an exponential increase in complaints against SPD, in 2020, this summer.",184,,
1507,0.97,10488.611,10506.562,"While there has been an increase in complaints made, I am sure, we heard at least 12,000 cases, complaints made.",184,,
1508,0.97,10515.905,10534.29,"I understand there are agencies that we have and I want to point out the inequity of asking for more money to investigate when they are 12,000 cases against this agency.",184,,
1509,0.97,10534.29,10536.959,"That's the point I want to make, thank you.",184,,
1510,0.97,10536.959,10544.967,Thank you.,185,,
1511,0.97,10544.967,10548.871,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",185,,
1512,0.97,10548.871,10549.772,Thank you very much.,186,,
1513,0.97,10549.772,10599.488,"As it relates to the transfer of the parking enforcement officers to S.D.O.T., I would like to fly in case there was not a similar correspondence, the PEO's have communicated through their Union and their interests, they are totally supportive of the concept but they are less interested in being transferred to the Department of it transportation and more interested in being transferred to the new community safety Department.",186,,
1514,0.97,10599.488,10628.818,They very helpfully identify some of the functions that they are ready to take on and functions that are formally provided by sworn police officers in one of those functions relates to the issue that I raised earlier that Julie addressed and that is the staffing of special events unflagging.,186,,
1515,0.97,10628.818,10649.638,I do want to say again and I'm happy to share this memo but I have a memo that says there is no need to make a change in state law and to allow for Nonuniformed or Non-Sworn employees to do this work.,186,,
1516,0.97,10649.638,10686.208,It has to be people who are empowered to override traffic signals and there is a that says only sworn officers are empowered to override traffic symbol so I really appreciate that the PEO's are open to taking on some of this work and are interested in helping out with the verification that is required for red light camera enforcement and school zone enforcement and this is a processing function which might need a change in state law.,186,,
1517,0.97,10686.208,10698.387,We talked about it earlier when we passed legislation allowing for camera enforcement for transit lanes.,186,,
1518,0.97,10698.387,10720.209,They also expressed a willingness to respond to Noninjury collisions and take the report in for the reports for SPD and also open to doing work associate with reports of abandoned vehicles or Rvs with people living in them.,186,,
1519,0.97,10720.209,10729.552,The identify the reasons why they are well poised to take on some of these functions.,186,,
1520,0.97,10729.552,10741.997,It has a lot to do with their experience working in a technology driven environments.,186,,
1521,0.97,10741.997,10761.417,Their diversity of this unit with more than 60% being Multilingual and they are focused on De-Escalation and communicating and customer service.,186,,
1522,0.97,10761.417,10777.199,I want to really fly both of the issues of my interest in their support of taking on more responsibility but also the request that we consider the transfer not to S.D.O.T.,186,,
1523,0.97,10777.199,10786.509,But to the new community safety Department.,186,,
1524,0.97,10786.509,10787.176,Thank you.,186,,
1525,0.97,10787.176,10788.177,Thank you very much.,187,,
1526,0.97,10788.177,10794.283,Any comments on that from the team?,187,,
1527,0.97,10794.283,10806.228,"Okay, Councilmember Herbold, thank you for putting that into the record . I'm sorry, Julie, did I see your hand?",187,,
1528,0.97,10806.228,10809.298,I was going to indicate that nothing is off the table in the long-term.,188,,
1529,0.97,10809.298,10813.636,There are bargaining issues with taking work which can be addressed and we are poised to do that.,188,,
1530,0.97,10813.636,10816.605,It's the right time to start doing that.,188,,
1531,0.97,10816.605,10817.039,"But, S.D.O.T.",188,,
1532,0.97,10817.039,10827.249,Made sense for us on a policy level with the immediate Short- term given that special event funding will go through S.D.O.T.,188,,
1533,0.97,10827.249,10840.796,And the traffic engineer is the one that gives the powers that they currently have and that made sense in short-term for a quick 2021 budget Effectuation.,188,,
1534,0.97,10840.796,10851.14,I think we are all open to long- term Reshuffling depending on how the process plays out.,188,,
1535,0.97,10851.14,10857.246,Thank you so much.,189,,
1536,0.97,10857.246,10862.484,The next person I have is Council President Gonzales and then Councilmember Lewis.,189,,
1537,0.97,10862.484,10870.559,"Thank you so much and really quickly, I want to go back--I forgot the slide number.",190,,
1538,0.97,10870.559,10885.708,Slide number 10 and I have a different line of questioning that what trip I was asking which is about the accountability proposal.,190,,
1539,0.97,10885.708,10913.102,"The Mayor had stated the intent to move police accountability out of the Seattle police Department budget and if I'm understanding this presentation accurately, the 21 proposed budget maintains OPA within the Seattle police Department.",190,,
1540,0.97,10913.102,10937.259,I am seeking some clarification on that assumption as I am seeing it on this particular slide with explanation of the decision-making process that appears to have led to the 20 chair Mosqueda budget.,190,,
1541,0.97,10937.259,10940.729,"Actually, I can take that one.",191,,
1542,0.97,10940.729,10963.686,That was on our short list operationally and functionally with the independent units within the police Department and was on the National short list of organizations that we may move out from under the Seattle police Department.,191,,
1543,0.97,10963.686,11008.997,"After consulting with the director and some of the accountability partners and any changes that would have the consent decree and cause us to have higher levels of approval from the court or dealing with the DOJ notification and approval of that coupled with our concerns of maintaining the Fidelity of access to information that OPA currently enjoys is being part of the Seattle police Department and while we are not ruling it out as something that could potentially happen in the future, it didn't seem like something we could Feasibly accomplish for the 20 chair Mosqueda budget.",191,,
1544,0.97,11008.997,11014.737,We are not ruling it out and we are open to that but it also did not appear to be something we can actually accomplish for the 2021.,191,,
1545,0.97,11014.737,11019.541,Okay.,192,,
1546,0.97,11019.541,11022.211,"So, I appreciate the additional texture to that.",192,,
1547,0.97,11022.211,11084.773,"Do you want to signal my concern that moving forward, statements related to to find the police accountability system needs to be worked through the ordinary processes including engagement with OPA and Oig in the police Commission and I personally, as someone who was the sponsor of the 2017 police accountability ordinance was a little shocked that the statement was made without any consultation of members of the city council including myself who was one of the prime authors and sponsors of the exists of the system.",192,,
1548,0.97,11084.773,11096.518,This could have a large implication as you all eventually found out after digging then a little bit more into the pragmatic policy issues related to a suggestion like that.,192,,
1549,0.97,11096.518,11118.04,I would appreciate if moving forward that there would be a more Proactive effort or just an effort to include those was on the city council who are and have been following this issue very closely and have enchanting this issue closely.,192,,
1550,0.97,11118.04,11135.557,"Again, I'm concerned to hear that not even the director was consulted before he was made by the Mayor and I just want to flag that.",192,,
1551,0.97,11135.557,11137.526,"Well said, thank you very much, Council President.",193,,
1552,0.97,11137.526,11144.266,I believe many of us echo that point.,193,,
1553,0.97,11144.266,11145.701,"Councilmember Lewis, you are up next.",193,,
1554,0.97,11145.701,11146.535,Thank you so much.,194,,
1555,0.97,11146.535,11149.771,My question was actually asked so I am satisfied.,194,,
1556,0.97,11149.771,11158.881,Thank you.,195,,
1557,0.97,11158.881,11163.585,"Councilmember Juarez, just wanted to check in with you and feel free to let me know if you have any questions or comments.",195,,
1558,0.97,11163.585,11166.989,"Okay, I'm not seeing anyone raise their hand or Chime in.",195,,
1559,0.97,11166.989,11177.199,"Okay, I have a few follow-up questions and then we might actually be able to get through these next two slides if we keep going for a second.",195,,
1560,0.97,11177.199,11183.071,I'm looking at item number five and slide nine.,195,,
1561,0.97,11183.071,11200.122,"Obviously, this is an area that the Council included and I know Councilmember Lewis did not have a comment on this but he and others have a very clear about the interest to move the call center out of the current operations and I appreciate this is reflected in the proposed budget.",195,,
1562,0.97,11200.122,11207.029,I know Councilmember Herbold has been a longtime champion of this as well.,195,,
1563,0.97,11207.029,11222.444,I guess my question here is I believe the executive director mentioned in your comments that you are assuming that the transfer does happen and all of the 911 civilian efforts get moved into a new independent Department and that reflects 100% change.,195,,
1564,0.97,11222.444,11223.111,Is that correct?,195,,
1565,0.97,11223.111,11224.913,All those dollars are allocated to that?,195,,
1566,0.97,11224.913,11226.548,That's correct.,196,,
1567,0.97,11226.548,11247.069,I'm trying to take that into account in light of what I believe Ms. Klein you said that this is going to be a transfer that is effectuated and I believe once a determination is made through public consensus on what that should look like.,197,,
1568,0.97,11247.069,11249.271,Is that correct?,197,,
1569,0.97,11249.271,11274.463,"No, a slight Tweak to that, we are looking for a consensus on what other services should be dispatched out of the Seattle emergency communications center.",198,,
1570,0.97,11274.463,11278.9,The change--is already in effect right now given the effect that we sent out through the budget as well?,199,,
1571,0.97,11278.9,11294.516,We have begun the process and there are a number of Certifications that we have to apply with the override and change the code before we apply it but it is in motion.,200,,
1572,0.97,11294.516,11303.525,The wheels are in motion so you are anticipating January 1 of 2021 that you will be able to see this transfer realized?,201,,
1573,0.97,11303.525,11305.794,Fingers crossed.,202,,
1574,0.97,11305.794,11308.43,That is our goal.,203,,
1575,0.97,11308.43,11311.833,We are hopeful we can do it.,203,,
1576,0.97,11311.833,11324.68,Is the same true of item number four here on slide eight?,204,,
1577,0.97,11324.68,11324.946,Yes.,205,,
1578,0.97,11324.946,11326.481,"All right, thank you very much.",206,,
1579,0.97,11326.481,11334.856,I want to turn back to Councilmember Juarez.,206,,
1580,0.97,11334.856,11338.46,I understand we may have had you on mute so apologies for that if you did have something.,206,,
1581,0.97,11338.46,11339.061,"Thank you, yes.",207,,
1582,0.97,11339.061,11344.566,"I usually get in trouble for not having nude on and for once, I was talking away and no one heard me.",207,,
1583,0.97,11344.566,11355.744,"Just briefly, I know we will wrap up here from what we heard today but we had about seven or eight questions Teed up and most of them were answered and some of them I can talk to Dr.",207,,
1584,0.97,11355.744,11365.687,Fischer off-line about in the contract that we have been waiting on to execute that so I will put it out there now.,207,,
1585,0.97,11365.687,11390.879,"Based on what I am her hearing today and what we have learned from the Powerpoint, just preliminary with what we have learned what I have learned today, I wanted to begin where we end or I want to begin and end in the same place that it has become clear which we already know that more police doesn't necessarily equal more safety.",207,,
1586,0.97,11390.879,11423.678,"We will struggle with the question of whether 1400 officers are either not enough or too much and it is clear to me based on the questions that were posed by Councilmember Gonzalez, yourself and Councilmember Herbold that we have to Recalibrate the number of officers which in my view where I am looking at is the decrease based on current service levels and how we do that in redefining and changing the beauties of police officers.",207,,
1587,0.97,11423.678,11441.863,"I believe it is important that we pointed out about the population and increase of the 23% and as Councilmember Gonzalez said, that can be a complete staffing decision or sworn resource allocation decision that there other tools that you use but it is still relevant.",207,,
1588,0.97,11441.863,11467.255,"Basically, what I think I have heard and have learned and I will have more follow-up questions and maybe I will run some of them by Councilmember Herbold as well but that the history and facts are relevant and again, in many communities and this has been true for ever, more police officers to equal more violence and that is the fact that we can't look away from.",207,,
1589,0.97,11467.255,11489.778,"I guess going forward from listening and thank you, Angela for the great overview on the information you provided in Urinalysis but what I'm walking away with is the question that you keep coming back to and what we will struggle with is how we maintain current services with less police officers and basically it will require us and you to think and act differently.",207,,
1590,0.97,11489.778,11496.718,That is in a sweeping fashion about how we look at community policing in that it is a new day.,207,,
1591,0.97,11496.718,11505.627,I understand you have your data points and analysis and tools that you look at and then Q Dr.,207,,
1592,0.97,11505.627,11535.457,Fischer for your information in Dr. noble but what is being required of us and should be and what we should be held accountable to is that we are marching in the direction of dismantling or Reallocating resources out of SPD and everything we have been saying and now we are talking about how to get that plan done.,207,,
1593,0.97,11535.457,11537.559,"So, council or matter present or Madam chair, I'm sorry.",207,,
1594,0.97,11537.559,11538.96,That is what I wanted to end with.,207,,
1595,0.97,11538.96,11543.832,What I have learned today in the questions that were answered for us today and that is where I will leave it.,207,,
1596,0.97,11543.832,11544.232,Thank you.,207,,
1597,0.97,11544.232,11549.871,"Very well set and thank you very much, Councilmember Juarez.",208,,
1598,0.97,11549.871,11551.773,I am not seeing any additional hands at this point.,208,,
1599,0.97,11551.773,11578.5,I will have final comments at the very end . We do have some time to go into these next slides if you would like or we can hold them for this afternoon's presentation but if you would like to walk through--I'm seeing a nod so what you let us know what your preference is and I'm happy for you to take the next 10 minutes or so.,208,,
1600,0.97,11578.5,11583.672,I don't know if Angela and Julie agree with me but I think this is a lot of the meat of this afternoon's discussion.,209,,
1601,0.97,11583.672,11594.816,"So, we could briefly preview it or just--and look for Juliet executive information.",209,,
1602,0.97,11594.816,11599.788,I'm happy to preview and there will be plenty of opportunity for in-depth discussion and questions this afternoon.,210,,
1603,0.97,11599.788,11611.633,I look to chair Mosqueda on what to do.,210,,
1604,0.97,11611.633,11628.917,"In that case, if it is a Lead-In to this afternoon and director noble if it is okay with you as well, I may ask us to hold this as an introductory component to this afternoon's conversation and we know it will be robust and lengthy and I would like for us to make sure that we are getting all of our questions put together.",211,,
1605,0.97,11628.917,11630.952,I assume all of you will be back this afternoon.,211,,
1606,0.97,11630.952,11635.757,Is that a correct assumption?,211,,
1607,0.97,11635.757,11637.659,"Okay, I am seeing a nod from Dr. Fischer.",211,,
1608,0.97,11637.659,11649.471,"Angela, if we don't see you this afternoon, thank you for walking us through this.",211,,
1609,0.97,11649.471,11651.172,"Julie, you will be here this afternoon?",211,,
1610,0.97,11651.172,11651.373,Okay.,211,,
1611,0.97,11651.373,11652.874,"Chief Diaz, will you be here this afternoon?",211,,
1612,0.97,11652.874,11653.775,I don't believe so.,212,,
1613,0.97,11653.775,11655.777,I know you are in good hands with Dr. Fischer.,212,,
1614,0.97,11655.777,11656.378,Okay.,213,,
1615,0.97,11656.378,11663.018,Thank you for your presence this morning and for answering those questions.,213,,
1616,0.97,11663.018,11672.494,"Councilmember Herbold, let me know as a person that has this Department in her Committee, she doesn't have any closing comments and I'm sure we will have more to say this afternoon.",213,,
1617,0.97,11672.494,11678.4,"Director, did you have more to say?",213,,
1618,0.97,11678.4,11684.572,"Yes, I wanted to point out that we did transmit a number of answers to some of the questions that were alluded to today.",214,,
1619,0.97,11684.572,11705.593,I encourage you to check in if you haven't heard yet with Greg dos and they were some questions with some of that information which is included in that packet along with some of the other questions that Councilmember Juarez alluded to.,214,,
1620,0.97,11705.593,11713.034,"If you are not seeing something you need, please do not hesitate to throw those questions in the Tracker and we will do our best to get back to you as soon as we can.",214,,
1621,0.97,11713.034,11729.25,This work is really important and this is me personally saying this work is really important and I want to make sure that you have the information you need to make decisions and I really look forward to collaborating on this and not just through the budget process but going into next year as well so thank you for the time today.,214,,
1622,0.97,11729.25,11740.662,Thank you very much for all of your time . We will have the opportunity to continue this conversation this afternoon.,215,,
1623,0.97,11740.662,11755.076,At 2 PM we will start with the public safety overview and I think it is important for us to initiate our conversation with the slides that lead into the Mayor's vision of revision public safety so we can begin our conversation fresh in a new.,215,,
1624,0.97,11755.076,11794.516,A few closing thoughts and I want to add to what many of our colleagues have said including Councilmember Juarez sentiments and some of the conversation we had evolved around the status quo and I heard that term used that we are assuming status quo and that the workload on the functions of the police will remain the same and we are funding the status quo levels of engagement that the police are required to have with the community and I think that is the question that is in front of us.,215,,
1625,0.97,11794.516,11799.721,Do we continue the status quo or do we make the changes that many of the community members across our city and country are demand in.,215,,
1626,0.97,11799.721,11827.816,I think the question was a matter of whether or not we will continue with traditional policing or Incarceration in prosecution or if there is new and Re-Envisioned strategy that Councilmember Herbold articulated that requires us to act with urgency and how that reflected in the 21 budget.,215,,
1627,0.97,11827.816,11835.723,I think we are poised to ask more questions this afternoon about whether or not we are taking those steps and whether or not they are big enough and how quickly those can be reported in the budget.,215,,
1628,0.97,11835.723,11854.442,"Whether or not we are actually examining whether the right place for services to be delivered to the community should be done through the police Department or as the chief has mentioned earlier, are we continuing to ask more from police officers year after year?",215,,
1629,0.97,11854.442,11869.791,"I am not having to put words into your mouth, chief Diaz but I think that is part of the questions we are trying to answer if we are asking the officers to doing the right thing and showing up where they have guns.",215,,
1630,0.97,11869.791,11886.507,I think specifically members of our society have asked for us not just reiterate that black lives matter but to also recognize that they are chanting it because people in their homes and going grocery shopping or driving or going for walks are being arrested at higher rates than we are seeing in death as well.,215,,
1631,0.97,11886.507,11900.321,It is really important just to the conversation this afternoon not just on policy questions and dollar figures but the lives that are at risk and the lives that have been lost and that is where we will pick up the conversation this afternoon.,215,,
1632,0.97,11900.321,11925.246,We want to make sure this is not actually a status quo conversation in our status quo budget and also requires us to make investments necessary to invest in the community at the same time so that the calls are answered by the trusted community partners and priorities are shifted for officers back into areas where they are not being called to respond to situations where a gun or badge is not required.,215,,
1633,0.97,11925.246,11947.769,"As we talked about, also being in that moment with dredging traffic and I think it takes away from the officers with the staffing rules that the Council president and Councilmember Herbold have articulate questions about.",215,,
1634,0.97,11947.769,11978.7,We will begin the conversation this afternoon but that is the frame I would encourage folks to bring into the discussion this afternoon given that we have heard the term status quo used a few times and how we push ourselves outside of that current box of thinking with funding the status quo and acting to create public safety for everybody and to a truly Reimagined system.,215,,
1635,0.97,11978.7,11980.168,"Councilmember Herbold, did I see your hand?",215,,
1636,0.97,11980.168,11980.768,"No, okay.",215,,
1637,0.97,11980.768,11984.505,"Chief Diaz, I will give you the parting word this morning if we will not see you this afternoon.",215,,
1638,0.97,11984.505,11987.608,"Again, thank you for your time and I will let you have the last word.",215,,
1639,0.97,11987.608,12004.926,I want to say thank you to all the Councilmembers and have the opportunity to discuss with the budget looks like as well as we are trying to push our Department into a very much more Transformative process of looking at what items or responses we are responding to.,216,,
1640,0.97,12004.926,12017.739,"Over the last decade, I mentioned this to many of you that we have said for a long period of time that we can't arrest our way out of some of the social issues.",216,,
1641,0.97,12017.739,12024.645,We are committed to moving some of those items out that we should not be responding to.,216,,
1642,0.97,12024.645,12032.153,That we also know what the workload is in the areas we are responding to and some of the staffing things.,216,,
1643,0.97,12032.153,12043.131,These are the discussions that will help us move the Department forward in the future so thank you for your time and I appreciate this discussion today.,216,,
1644,0.97,12043.131,12049.837,Thank you very much.,217,,
1645,0.97,12049.837,12099.954,"Through another Venue that is not directly related to the budget, I do look forward to talking more with you about the accountability for the Trolling or dragging of members of the media that has been occurring over the last few months and making sure that folks that are either members of the press or legal observers and those who are medics in our community continue to have the ability to serve our community members without being intimidated and I know this is something we have chatted about before but I want to note my continued interest in the area and not specific to the budget or policy so I appreciate your interest in engaging in that and look forward to your leadership to make sure that that behavior stops.",217,,
1646,0.97,12099.954,12100.421,Thank you.,218,,
1647,0.97,12100.421,12101.222,Thank you.,219,,
1648,0.97,12101.222,12102.623,We will see you all at 2 PM.,219,,
1649,0.97,12102.623,12105.86,The select budget committee meeting will adjourn until 2 PM.,219,,
1650,0.97,12105.86,12106.727,Thank you all very much.,219,,
1651,0.97,12106.727,12107.728,Thank you.,220,,
1652,0.97,12107.728,12109.23,Thank you very much.,220,,
