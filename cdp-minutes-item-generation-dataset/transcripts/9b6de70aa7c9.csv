40,0.97,157.657,170.87,I want to thank Council President Gonzalez for her leadership in gun violence prevention policy and appreciate the work of everyone in her office in this important work that is so critical to our communities.,19,,
41,0.97,170.87,188.588,Today is a great opportunity for us to demonstrate our commitment to gun violence prevention and support community leaders and gun sensible advocates who are working everyday towards future free of gun violence.,19,,
42,0.97,188.588,196.963,Skied the Seattle police Department for some data about gun violence during 2020.,19,,
43,0.97,196.963,201.267,The police Department does an annual report on gun violence.,19,,
44,0.97,201.267,223.59,They report that in 2020 there were 421 reported incidents of shots fired up from 332 such incidents in 2019 and an increase of 89 incidents which represents a 27% increase.,19,,
45,0.97,223.59,236.502,We had 301 incidents of shots fired in 2020 and so that is compared to 235 such incidents in 2019.,19,,

51,0.97,272.338,280.346,Just want to recognize the origins of the wear orange campaign.,19,,
52,0.97,280.346,295.428,Wear orange is the color that Pendleton's friends wore in her honor after she was shot and killed in Chicago at the age of 15 just one week after performing at President Obama's second Inaugural parade in 2013.,19,,
53,0.97,295.428,302.001,After her death her friends started to wear Orange to raise awareness about gun violence.,19,,
54,0.97,302.001,320.086,What started with a group of friends on the South side of Chicago has turned into a national movement to honor the hundred lives cut short and the hundreds more injured by gun violence everyday and to demand action.,19,,
55,0.97,320.086,336.436,"Orange expresses our collective nation as whole for a future free from gun violence where our movie theaters, our concerts, places of Worships and schools are free from gun violence.",19,,
56,0.97,336.436,350.016,Regulations for the safe storage of firearms.,19,,
57,0.97,350.016,376.642,I want to also recognize some of the objectives accomplished this year in a state legislative agenda thanks to the work of gun common sense advocates for responsible solutions to gun violence which assisted the passage of Senate bill 5038 prohibiting the open carry of firearms at public demonstrations.,19,,
58,0.97,376.642,400.233,And also want to uplift the work that this Council has done and will don't do to increase funding for a variety of violence prevention programs in the example of increased funding of $14 million in 2021 for violence prevention program.,19,,
59,0.97,400.233,400.633,Thank you.,19,,
60,0.97,400.633,405.938,Thank you so much Council member Herbold for those comments.,20,,

62,0.97,418.418,423.055,I see Council member Strauss has his hand raised.,20,,
63,0.97,423.055,426.726,Just glad to see you back.,21,,

66,0.97,428.795,442.508,I also want to thank Council member Herbold for bringing this Forker ward and also you for bringing this proclamation forward because we know that gun violence is preventable.,21,,
67,0.97,442.508,456.856,"When gun--this date was set as an awareness day seven years ago, that was a year that we could not get one gun responsibility bill passed through the legislator.",21,,
68,0.97,456.856,469.502,Today we are seeing multiple common sense pieces of legislation that protect public health and ensure responsible gun ownership being passed through the legislator every year.,21,,
69,0.97,469.502,481.414,There is an article in today's Seattle times by Joseph and Sarah Jean green about extreme risk protection orders and the path they took Legislatively seven years ago.,21,,
70,0.97,481.414,507.64,"That the time I worked for Senator working on one of the first drafts of the protection order and when we couldn't get a hearing, the state legislator--I left working for Senator to join the Alliance for gun responsibility to see that bill be passed by initiative with 69.4% of the vote in the 2016 election.",21,,
71,0.97,507.64,517.416,Just to demonstrate the common sense gun legislation has the support of the state even if it can't get a hearing at the legislator.,21,,
72,0.97,517.416,526.392,I just take this moment to note we--we would not be here and we could not have done this without grass roots advocates.,21,,
73,0.97,526.392,529.262,Without the Alliance for gun responsibility.,21,,
74,0.97,529.262,533.566,Without demand action and without grandmothers against gun violence.,21,,
75,0.97,533.566,536.936,"These organizations, these local grass roots organizations are what move the needle.",21,,
76,0.97,536.936,543.209,They move the needle more than any of us can here sitting at the Seattle city council.,21,,
77,0.97,543.209,556.055,"I want to take this moment to thank you, Nancy, all of the grandmothers out there with grandmothers against gun violence and of course the Alliance for gun responsibility.",21,,

151,0.97,1054.153,1054.386,Hi.,31,,
152,0.97,1054.386,1059.491,Good afternoon.,31,,
153,0.97,1059.491,1066.365,Last week Bob Ferguson announced that three Tacoma police officers have been charged in last year's murder of manual Ellis.,31,,
154,0.97,1066.365,1076.642,It took the resurgence of a black lives matter movement and the presence and the unimaginable strength of family and friends to keep this case in the news.,31,,
155,0.97,1076.642,1087.352,It also took the highly unusual intervention of the governor and Attorney General in order to provide for truly independent investigation.,31,,
156,0.97,1087.352,1096.195,What about all those people killed by Seattle Olice whose families couldn't navigate what San unresponsive and Victimizing accountability system?,31,,
157,0.97,1096.195,1107.806,What about those who didn't have family in the area to advocate for their loved ones and to bring their cases to light?,31,,
158,0.97,1107.806,1125.524,The families and friends of had to suffer not just their loved ones' murder but Additionally suffer from the fact that they were killed in Seattle where truly independent investigations have been and remain impossible.,31,,
159,0.97,1125.524,1130.896,We still have a system where it is only police that investigate police.,31,,
160,0.97,1130.896,1144.109,We still have a system where the head of the body that investigates police is someone who spent his entire career defending police officers.,31,,
161,0.97,1144.109,1152.684,"Please, go to Seattlestop.Org to find out how we can bring real civilian accountability to Seattle.",31,,
162,0.97,1152.684,1154.52,Thank you.,31,,
163,0.97,1154.52,1155.654,Thank you.,32,,
164,0.97,1155.654,1162.995,Next up is Tana followed by Alice.,32,,

166,0.97,1163.295,1163.595,District 7.,33,,
167,0.97,1163.595,1169.101,I'm calling to say that Council should reject bill 11981.,33,,
168,0.97,1169.101,1179.111,"Spd's excess overtime spending and on going salary savings should go to community led budgeting, not back into a kept that uses its resources to harm community members.",33,,
169,0.97,1179.111,1192.991,I would like to read apart of my testimony that has made it to the National lawyer's--[Indiscernible] I arrived for a peaceful rally.,33,,
170,0.97,1192.991,1201.667,All of a sudden I was surprised country music started Blarg on the speakers and dozens of police officers came out of nowhere using tear gas.,33,,
171,0.97,1201.667,1208.974,It felt like it was game to them.,33,,

1226,0.97,6782.609,6798.291,Wrote to the Council that even after the committee meeting supporting the smaller cut and lifting the $5 million he wrote Court in the monitor are increasingly concerned about the reduction of funding the Seattle police Department.,305,,
1227,0.97,6798.291,6824.15,In response I proposed an amendment voting staff now estimates up to $13 million for salary Savings and releasing a $2.5 million spending proviso based on sustained misconduct not possible at this time due to the intersection of public safety civil service rules and state law.,305,,
1228,0.97,6824.15,6831.891,The legislation includes additional funds can be spent--[Indiscernible] as identified by the monitor.,305,,
1229,0.97,6831.891,6840.233,That is the background and the description of the bill before us today.,305,,

1233,0.97,6845.905,6857.884,"Colleagues, again, you will Van opportunity to either ask questions about the base bill or information comments on the base bill.",306,,
1234,0.97,6857.884,6881.074,I just think the conversation will be richer and--and more accurate if we have--a final amended bill before us for a debate.,306,,
1235,0.97,6881.074,6891.718,"If that is Okay, I would like to go ahead and ask Council member Herbold to address her first proposed amendment 1 if there is no objection with that.",306,,
1236,0.97,6891.718,6892.452,Go ahead.,306,,
1237,0.97,6892.452,6895.889,This one should be super easy.,307,,
1238,0.97,6895.889,6902.028,This is a technical amendment that was distributed via E-mail this morning.,307,,
1239,0.97,6902.028,6908.902,I--it was left off the agenda.,307,,
1240,0.97,6908.902,6915.341,I move to amend the bill.,307,,
1241,0.97,6915.341,6924.317,It was included on the record of could be sill bill 119981 and distributed via E-mail to Council members this morning.,307,,
1242,0.97,6924.317,6925.285,Second.,308,,

1245,0.97,6930.757,6935.461,Are there any additional comments on the proposed amendment 1?,309,,
1246,0.97,6935.461,6953.012,Again this is just an amendment with technical--what has been described as technical modifications to the base bill and so it is just a vote on the amendment itself.,309,,
1247,0.97,6953.012,6953.713,Council member Sawant.,309,,
1248,0.97,6953.713,6957.417,Thank you.,310,,

1250,0.97,6961.521,6969.295,I wanted to be clear to members of the public I oppose the bill as a whole and will vote against it when it is time for the final vote in a moment.,310,,
1251,0.97,6969.295,6972.932,This is a vote on the technical amendment now.,310,,
1252,0.97,6972.932,6989.682,I wanted to also add my comments to make it clear for the record coming out of the committee because of the way the minutes appear to the bills--that have more no votes than yes votes is confusing as Council members have stated.,310,,
1253,0.97,6989.682,6995.121,I voted no Oh on the bill in the committee because the majority of the committee voted no.,310,,
1254,0.97,6995.121,7002.595,The minutes show a do not pass recommendation and then list all the no votes as yes do not pass which is very confusing.,310,,
1255,0.97,7002.595,7011.804,Just to be clear to members of the public I voted no on this bill and will do so again.,310,,

1283,0.97,7063.189,7073.299,I will hand it over to Council member Lewis to make his motion and see if there is a second.,331,,
1284,0.97,7073.299,7076.202,"Thank you, Madam President.",332,,
1285,0.97,7076.202,7079.539,I move amendment 2.,332,,
1286,0.97,7079.539,7080.84,Is there a second?,333,,
1287,0.97,7080.84,7081.107,Second.,334,,
1288,0.97,7081.107,7081.574,Thank you.,335,,
1289,0.97,7081.574,7085.511,It has been moved and Seconded to Amernd the bill as presented on amendment 2.,335,,
1290,0.97,7085.511,7097.657,I will hand it back over to Council member them Lewis to walk us through amendment 2 and then we will have a discussion and debate.,335,,
1291,0.97,7097.657,7099.559,"Thank you, Madam President.",336,,
1292,0.97,7099.559,7108.034,I'm bringing amendment 2 as a--as an option for the Council to consider.,336,,
1293,0.97,7108.167,7133.426,[Indiscernible] I want to say at the top that the amendment in no way implies from me a lack of commitment to budgeting.,336,,
1294,0.97,7133.426,7161.787,I do not think that the money that has been Portioned already for the budgeting with enough time to be supplemented by additional appropriations on top of the 30 million.,336,,
1295,0.97,7161.787,7168.594,I would be supportive of putting additional money into that par Tistory budget.,336,,
1296,0.97,7168.594,7204.33,I bring this amendment for us Tohave a discussion and conversation of ways that we may be able to at the same time that we are building towards that Participatory budget Floss make some more short-term investments in other public safety programs that we know are working extremely well and to be responsive to the massive need that we see in the community and then I believe has eroded confidence from some community members in our ability to be responsive to the public safety challenges that the city is facing.,336,,
1297,0.97,7204.33,7211.103,And in a way that the police will not be frankly responsive.,336,,
1298,0.97,7211.103,7219.011,Under the investments that we are making here or some of the staffing investments through the staffing plan we funded.,336,,
1299,0.97,7219.011,7272.665,The big issue as I see it and like I'm Digressing a little bit and talking more generally about the public funds and the Emails that all of our offices get that a lot community members that are very compassionate are frustrated for a variety of different reasons and some that are not that compassionate and frustrated for a lot of different reasons that the state of sanctions Encampments and chronic homelessness in the city and the inability to provide an appropriate level of shelter and care that is in a way that is culturally competent and that is resources for the issues that people are facing and that gives community members a contact or someone they can call if not the police to intervene in these kinds of circumstances.,336,,
1300,0.97,7272.665,7288.948,The just care program that we talked about last week that I talked about a briefing this morning is something that can be scaled to provide that level of response for every neighborhood instead of the Chinatown International district and Pinier square where it currently serves.,336,,
1301,0.97,7288.948,7300.593,There are plans to expand it under the American recovery act appropriations but that still is not going to be to an extent where they can do the work they are doing on the citywide cases.,336,,
1302,0.97,7300.593,7307.366,So I do just want to talk really briefly like a little bit more about just care.,336,,
1303,0.97,7307.366,7321.314,This amend would move the $2 million instead of moving it into the Participatory process moving it to the procurement to the county to expand the just care program.,336,,
1304,0.97,7321.314,7331.49,"As we heard last week the just care program is composed of a consortium of providers, many of which are led.",336,,
1305,0.97,7331.49,7349.041,We heard from Dominic Davis on our panel that work with the consortium to provide cost care COM PENT security at a number of the hotels that the consortium leases.,336,,
1306,0.97,7349.041,7363.489,Public defender Association and the chief Seattle Club have all been a part of this multi provider effort to really get into these areas that have been the subject of public discourse around the public safety discussion.,336,,
1307,0.97,7363.489,7371.497,And resolve the underlying problem for all Stakeholders involved.,336,,
1308,0.97,7371.497,7393.886,To provide safety and security to people in Encampments and provide a resource that is alternative to the police and to intervene in some of these situations and it has been directly responsive to the issues that we are facing.,336,,
1309,0.97,7393.886,7409.034,I have concerns as we are a year into and there is discussions to continue down this path of continuing community based alternatives that Council efforts are losing momentum in a lot of respects.,336,,
1310,0.97,7409.034,7423.749,"It is because as far as I can tell what my Councilmember calls the test for the ability to see and understand what the alternatives are and how they are responsive to their needs, how it affects their daily life.",336,,
1311,0.97,7423.749,7431.69,I say this to someone that is uniquely positioned because I have constituents that have seen the see test.,336,,
1312,0.97,7431.69,7445.771,I have people that have reached out to my office that are not historic components of housing Irst and harm reduction but they have seen it work and be responsive to their concerns and they have the zeal of converts and leaning in to it.,336,,
1313,0.97,7445.771,7462.688,This is the kind of momentum that will help to drive the broader restructuring to set a new national standard of centering our housing first and culture and competent care for Militarized policing.,336,,
1314,0.97,7462.688,7471.797,We are not quickly to respond and give other neighborhoods that impression of some of these alternatives.,336,,
1315,0.97,7471.797,7474.767,I'm worried that the inevitable inertia of things will lead to back sliding.,336,,
1316,0.97,7474.767,7497.99,Be it back sliding that is ordered by a federal court who is inpatient with the process or unconvinced for waiting for community investments to get off of the ground and be it the back sliding and the future councils.,336,,
1317,0.97,7497.99,7539.899,I am worried about losing the moment and convening this conversation that perhaps some of the community investments should be made out of order of the broader Participatory process and to be directly responsive to situations where people in Encampments are suffering from diseases typically common in third world circumstances and being victims of crime that recently Cull come culminated in a neighbor that was Unhoused.,336,,
1318,0.97,7539.899,7551.543,We continue to build on the work of this city service citywide to be enjoyed by every neighborhood.,336,,
1319,0.97,7551.543,7563.289,I do want to conclude that $2 million alone is not going to do that but we can set an expectation that as we expand and build out a just care citywide network of care that money should come from the Seattle police Department.,336,,
1320,0.97,7563.289,7572.698,It is money going into what community members typically think and associate that police Department should be doing.,336,,
1321,0.97,7572.698,7602.061,I have a whole Email Inbok as my colleagues do of people saying we need police to show up to that encampment and them saying the police can't provide shelter place but the police will show up and say they can do anything and drive on and that is common in a lot of Emails that I have.,336,,
1322,0.97,7602.061,7633.392,"They are telling the truth, they can't do anything when they show up to the Encampments unless they can establish probable cause immediately to a crime happening in front of them and put the person experiencing homelessness in jail they will be back on the street in a few hours because the jail can't provide mental health care or treatment or the things that our homeless neighbors need to be successful.",336,,
1323,0.97,7633.392,7635.661,Just care can't.,336,,
1324,0.97,7635.661,7654.546,I think we have the broader cornucopia to participate in budgeting and so we can build the just care network at the expense of the police Department since it is case load that is being transferred.,336,,
1325,0.97,7654.546,7657.282,I think there's a nexus that makes sense.,336,,
1326,0.97,7657.282,7668.16,Maybe it won't be through this amendment or another conversation but we are accumulating salary saving for officers that are leaving the Department.,336,,
1327,0.97,7668.16,7672.264,That under the proviso that we set in the fall.,336,,
1328,0.97,7672.264,7698.59,I think we can be strategic with the salary saving to treat the just care response system the way that we treat the police Department and the fire Department as a permanent and ongoing institutional pillar of our public safety system that has the resources dedicated in such a way that they can build capacity and scale up and depend on that appropriation on a rolling basis.,336,,
1329,0.97,7698.59,7706.031,By amendment is a way to introduce that conversation to the discourse of what we are doing here at the Council.,337,,
1330,0.97,7706.031,7711.37,I understand that it probably won't necessarily be successful today.,337,,
1331,0.97,7711.37,7724.45,I am sensitive about the fact that it was previously earmarked for Participatory budgeting and this is rerouting this and I acknowledge that I have a copy of that and not thrilled about that.,337,,
1332,0.97,7724.45,7749.174,"But I am also just saying this out of severe frustration, not with my colleagues or the provider community, but just generally that there are resources to address these problems and they seem Solvable and we have a hearing with just care that seems Solvable if the people doing the working get the resource that they need.",337,,
1333,0.97,7749.174,7766.792,And maybe don't do it here but I did with respect to Cue up the conversation and I appreciate your consideration and I appreciate the time to talk about it.,337,,
1334,0.97,7766.792,7780.639,"Councilmember Lewis, I will ask if people have comments on that amendment if you can use the ring feature on zoom that can be helpful in keeping track of those if you would like to make comments on amend two.",338,,
1335,0.97,7780.639,7786.678,First in the Cue is Councilmember Herbold.,338,,
1336,0.97,7786.678,7802.127,"Mostly as the sponsor of the underlying legislation, who with the proposal to allocate these funds originally to Participatory budgeting, I want to say that I welcome the discussion and I welcome this amendment.",339,,
1337,0.97,7802.127,7806.064,I think a law has changed since December of last year.,339,,
1338,0.97,7806.064,7818.677,Where as with today's vote on Councilmember Morales' legislation we are still strongly in support of that $30 million investment.,339,,
1339,0.97,7818.677,7846.405,"And Participatory budgeting and the idea of adding to a pot of funds that it is not likely that we will see those investments on the ground until 2022 at this point, really to me underscores the need to look at where we could be spending dollars on programs that are on the Groundworking and making a difference for all of our communities.",339,,
1340,0.97,7846.405,7859.751,Our communities of neighbors that are Unhoused as well as communities of business people and residents that have homes.,339,,
1341,0.97,7859.751,7868.393,I really appreciate the creativity for Councilmember Lewis and the sense of urgency.,339,,
1342,0.97,7868.393,7872.664,I was at the SPD African- American advisory council meeting a couple weeks ago.,339,,
1343,0.97,7872.664,7876.668,I mentioned that in briefings a couple weeks ago.,339,,
1344,0.97,7876.668,7934.76,"They were really distraught that they were not seeing investments and they were really concerned about an increase of violence in their communities and you know just giving again this is not--this is not a criticism of any city Department or of our processes but just to give another example, the million in additional capacity building for public safety investments that the council voted on last November, are not to be out the door until August and I think people are rightfully concerned about those investments and other investments within the context of our reductions to the police Department being ones that can produce public safety outcomes.",339,,
1345,0.97,7934.76,7942.668,"Again, thank you Councilmember Lewis for bringing that forward to discussion.",339,,
1346,0.97,7942.668,7947.572,Next up is Councilmember Morales.,340,,
1347,0.97,7947.572,7948.273,Thank you.,341,,
1348,0.97,7948.273,7952.044,I want to thank Councilmember Lewis for bringing this forward.,341,,
1349,0.97,7952.044,7958.717,I don't intend to support the base bill here.,341,,
1350,0.97,7958.717,7974.8,But I do think that this is exactly what we mean supporting just cares is what we mean when we say we should be shifting the Abd budget into critical services.,341,,
1351,0.97,7974.8,7978.937,Community safety means a lot of different things.,341,,
1352,0.97,7978.937,7995.487,"Supporting investments, greater investment in our homeless services and community members and something as innovative and comprehensive as just cares meets that goal and criteria.",341,,
1353,0.97,7995.487,8013.405,I will be supporting this amendment and whether we do this here or we do it with--in a different way later this year this is the direction to go and I want to thank Councilmember Lewis for bringing this forward.,341,,
1354,0.97,8013.405,8018.877,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,342,,
1355,0.97,8018.877,8019.478,Councilmember Kshama Sawant.,342,,
1356,0.97,8019.478,8020.145,Thank you.,343,,
1357,0.97,8020.145,8029.354,I suppose increasing funding for just case and the budgeting fund I oppose this amendment that pits those two programs against each other.,343,,
1358,0.97,8029.354,8046.505,"Remember, this was a bill to cut $5.4 million from the police Department's budget to make up from the $5.1 million that they Stoe and did it more than they were authorized to.",343,,
1359,0.97,8046.505,8059.251,"The amendment, to remove $5.4 million from the police Department and a proviso was listed and another one lifted.",343,,
1360,0.97,8059.251,8067.426,Now this bill increases the funds that the police Department has access to by 4.5 million rather than decreasing it by 5.4 million.,343,,
1361,0.97,8067.426,8072.397,It is the opposite of what it was when it started.,343,,
1362,0.97,8072.397,8079.237,"The funding for just care, why does it have to be taken from the funding for Participatory budgeting.",343,,
1363,0.97,8079.237,8089.848,It should come from the money allocated by the police Department as been promised by the Council again and again.,343,,
1364,0.97,8089.848,8109.034,My office consulted leader in Decriminalized Seattle organization this morning about this amendment which they said they had not previously seen and that this amendment obscures the fact that the police Department's budget is not cut but good programs are being pit against each other.,343,,
1365,0.97,8109.034,8122.647,"I agree with the Grum that Councilmember Lewis makes that provides better funds for the police, absolutely but unfortunately what this amendment does is take those funds from Participatory budgets and not the police.",343,,
1366,0.97,8122.647,8130.021,I would be happy to support a moment that increases funds and not from the police Department and not Pitting good programs against each other.,343,,
1367,0.97,8130.021,8138.23,I will be voting no on this amendment.,343,,
1368,0.97,8138.23,8152.944,Councilmember Lewis expressed a cognitive Dissonance of using funds that was previously planned for Participatory but that is problematic because this bill as a whole no longer costs $5.4 million from the police Department.,343,,
1369,0.97,8152.944,8164.456,That is not the case and this amendment may have been different so I will be voting no.,343,,
1370,0.97,8164.456,8176.868,"Thank you Councilmember Sawant, is there any questions on proposed amendment two or comments?",343,,
1371,0.97,8176.868,8178.97,Okay.,344,,
1372,0.97,8178.97,8180.205,All right.,344,,
1373,0.97,8180.205,8184.543,"Colleagues, I just really quickly wanted to Chime in on this particular amendment.",344,,
1374,0.97,8184.543,8192.317,I don't think that the intent of Councilmember Lewis is to pit two good programs against each other.,344,,
1375,0.97,8192.317,8212.571,I see the intent and desire is to have additional resources to support a program that many of us have been very supportive of historically and I think we will continue to be supportive of programs that are modeled after the just care pilot program.,344,,
1376,0.97,8212.571,8244.469,I think my concern with this particular amendment is that I do worry ha what it would do is effectively take money that we had designated for Participatory processes and ahead of the designated process and the Provisos that I sponsored last fall and begin the process of Reappropriating those dollars to a different use.,344,,
1377,0.97,8244.469,8253.778,So I am concerned about that cognitive Dissonance that Councilmember Lewis described in his opening remarks.,344,,
1378,0.97,8253.778,8278.169,And worried that we have not done the National work with some of the impacted Stakeholders to be sure they understand what the effect and impact would be of adoption of this particular amendment in the context of the base Council bill.,344,,
1379,0.97,8278.169,8286.077,"For those reasons, I am not going to support the amendments in the current process and form and presentation.",344,,
1380,0.97,8286.077,8293.284,That does not mean that I am not supportive of just care in models like just care.,344,,
1381,0.97,8293.284,8350.275,We have taken strong votes and have taken important steps to make sure that model is continued to be supported and we have the Seattle rescue plan before us that was on today's introduction calendar that indicates no less than $49 million to additional homelessness and housing needs throughout the city and we will continue to have those conversations and not just one of the Federal dollars but part two of Federal dollars and I want to make sure that viewing public understands that will continue to be an opportunity to meet the needs described by Councilmember Lewis that I believe 100% of the Council is in agreement that we need to do and we must do more and more urgently to meet the needs Unhoused and the impacts that creates the city as a whole.,344,,
1382,0.97,8350.275,8360.218,For that reason won't be able to support this particular amendment at this juncture.,344,,
1383,0.97,8360.218,8365.724,Any other questions before Councilmember Lewis gets the last word.,344,,
1384,0.97,8365.724,8367.759,Not seeing any hands raised.,344,,
1385,0.97,8367.759,8373.765,I will ask you to make closing comments and call this amendment to a roll call.,344,,
1386,0.97,8373.765,8382.741,I will be brief Council President because I know there is a lot of speeches on the underlying bill.,345,,
1387,0.97,8382.741,8383.942,I appreciate the Council's consideration.,345,,
1388,0.97,8383.942,8395.153,I do own that this was sort of a spur of the moment amendment.,345,,
1389,0.97,8395.153,8399.858,So it wasn't really to a lot of our partners.,345,,
1390,0.97,8399.858,8401.493,I do think it was generated.,345,,
1391,0.97,8401.493,8413.471,We should think of the salary savings being realized from police Department attrition to projects like this regardless of whether it passes or fails.,345,,
1392,0.97,8413.471,8428.019,"You know, another consideration that I will say for people that are advocates are taking the savings and doubling down on increasing the resources for the police Department.",345,,
1393,0.97,8428.019,8433.358,They can only staff up so much in a given year.,345,,
1394,0.97,8433.358,8437.395,We funded the hiring plan for the year and this has no bearing on that.,345,,
1395,0.97,8437.395,8454.979,Our community can staff up faster to do some of the public safety work that people clamor from the police don't know it yet but they are clamoring for people like just care to get hired.,345,,
1396,0.97,8454.979,8482.173,And it could be a way for have a conversation and where we could hire more cops and not going to be here for three or four years because of how long it takes to hire them or hire some things to happen quicker and hopefully this amendment discussion cues you were a discussion like that and willing to vote on it and move on to an underlying bill.,345,,
1397,0.97,8482.173,8482.44,Great.,346,,
1398,0.97,8482.44,8501.025,That does conclude the discussion on proposed amendment two so I will go ahead that clerk call the role on the adoption of amendment two.,346,,
1399,0.97,8501.025,8503.127,Herbold.,347,,
1400,0.97,8503.127,8505.83,Yes.,348,,
1401,0.97,8505.83,8510.869,Juarez.,349,,
1402,0.97,8510.869,8516.14,Yes.,350,,

1406,0.97,8522.747,8524.382,No.,354,,

1408,0.97,8524.716,8524.949,No.,356,,
1409,0.97,8524.949,8525.45,Kshama Sawant.,357,,
1410,0.97,8525.45,8525.683,No.,358,,
1411,0.97,8525.683,8526.784,Council President Gonzelez.,359,,
1412,0.97,8526.784,8528.219,No.,360,,
1413,0.97,8528.219,8531.589,Five in favor and four opposed an.,360,,
1414,0.97,8531.589,8536.895,The motion carries and the amendment is adopted and the amended bill is before the Council.,361,,
1415,0.97,8536.895,8548.64,Are there--now I will open it up to comments on the bill as amended.,361,,
1416,0.97,8548.64,8549.874,So are there further comments on the bill.,361,,
1417,0.97,8549.874,8558.116,You will get the last bill as we close that debate.,361,,
1418,0.97,8558.116,8562.086,Councilmember Sawant I see your hand is raised.,361,,
1419,0.97,8562.086,8568.626,If anyone else wants to speak please raise your happened.,361,,
1420,0.97,8568.626,8570.161,Councilmember Sawant.,361,,
1421,0.97,8570.161,8570.561,Thank you.,362,,
1422,0.97,8570.561,8574.065,This bill is a farce.,362,,
1423,0.97,8574.065,8583.041,Amended and amended until it now does almost exactly the opposite of what it initially claimed to do.,362,,
1424,0.97,8583.041,8597.322,It is the bill that formally would have removed $5.4 million to the police Department for socially beneficial purposes and it creases the police department by $5.5 million.,362,,
1425,0.97,8597.322,8610.368,As was said in 1984 the Ministry of peace concerns itself with war and the Ministry of truth with lights and love with Torchier and plenty with starvation.,362,,
1426,0.97,8610.368,8618.943,They are not accident and nor do they result from order hypocrisy.,362,,
1427,0.97,8618.943,8620.445,They are normal Exercisess.,362,,
1428,0.97,8620.445,8644.902,This is a case stuff as to how the establishment including the Republican party shout for the police for for ability when the plaintiff murdered George Floyd thousands of people took to the streets and to protest police violence.,362,,
1429,0.97,8644.902,8649.774,Those overwhelm Blog protestors were yet with more police violence.,362,,
1430,0.97,8649.774,8667.792,"Tens of millions of dollars in police overtime, tear gas flash brigades and airplanes were looking for realm Video and mask arrests were used by the police to essentially rage war fair against the people of Seattle.",362,,
1431,0.97,8667.792,8681.606,"In the context of the largest Street protest in U.S. history the majority of the city Council, seven of the nine city council members pledged to support the movement's demand to Defund the police by 50%.",362,,
1432,0.97,8681.606,8685.41,City Council and other cities made similar promises.,362,,
1433,0.97,8685.41,8693.051,For the bun cigarette however I was the OM elected preparative to stand with the movement's demand.,362,,
1434,0.97,8693.051,8712.904,Not only did the majority of the Council refuse to follow through on their man to Defund the police by 50% percent and at the last meeting of 2020 when the Council was told that the police have Overspent their budget by $5.4 billion.,363,,
1435,0.97,8712.904,8718.142,They voted to give the police those $5.4 million et cetera.,363,,
1436,0.97,8718.142,8719.744,I was the only Councilmember to vote no.,363,,
1437,0.97,8719.744,8734.258,At the same time the majority of the Council promised to that I can that $5.4 million from the SP D 2021 budget and hold them accountable.,363,,
1438,0.97,8734.258,8738.863,I said that would not be trusted and here we are.,363,,
1439,0.97,8738.863,8741.532,Do Councilmemberrings remember their promises.,363,,
1440,0.97,8741.532,8757.949,Do Councilmember remember supporting the police like last summer and that they could not Defund the police in 2020 because we are using the number of police officers would take up to tough months if they promised to do so.,363,,
1441,0.97,8757.949,8772.363,They be do counsel members saying they Quanted fund the police in 2021 because that would require the use of officers in in 2021.,363,,
1442,0.97,8772.363,8778.069,The police layoffs was never a demand of the black lives matter movement.,363,,
1443,0.97,8778.069,8785.009,And then adding $5.4 million in December of 2020 and promised to remove it in 2021.,363,,
1444,0.97,8785.009,8798.089,Now they are saying that layoffs of application are not possible and please forget they have promised to keep the size of the police force and remove some of the money.,363,,
1445,0.97,8798.089,8808.966,Whether than the bill having the police breaking even and to what was added in 2020.,363,,
1446,0.97,8808.966,8818.876,It cuts $3 million from the police budget with one hand and gives the police access to $7.5 million.,363,,
1447,0.97,8818.876,8828.119,As Mol COM X said if you stick a knife in my back and pull it out six inches that I is not progress.,363,,
1448,0.97,8828.119,8834.425,There are the police Department's consequence for going over last year is to get extra money this year.,363,,
1449,0.97,8834.425,8838.996,This is what police Accountablity look likes for the Democrat establishment.,363,,
1450,0.97,8838.996,8843.401,This is the power about mass movement on the streets.,363,,
1451,0.97,8843.401,8858.115,At the height of the movement Council promised to Defund the police and a couple of months later we agreed to.,363,,
1452,0.97,8858.115,8865.423,The lessen for our movement we must depend on our strength and not put our faith in the establishment.,363,,
1453,0.97,8865.423,8873.564,Finally I would like to respond to what is circulated that Council can't Defund the police without the agreement of the Federal monitor.,363,,
1454,0.97,8873.564,8879.937,"Obviously members vote on the budget, not the Federal monitor and Councilmemberrings are responsible for their own votes.",363,,
1455,0.97,8879.937,8891.983,If Councilmembers agree with the Federal monitor or any other part of the political establishment that is their decision but not something that this wanted.,363,,
1456,0.97,8891.983,8894.652,The city council is the city's highest body.,363,,
1457,0.97,8894.652,8905.363,"I don't agree with the Federal monitor or that establishment, my foe has always been including this one will reflect that.",363,,
1458,0.97,8905.363,8917.742,If Councilmember were serious Aboutdy finding the police they would pass a budget.,363,,
1459,0.97,8917.742,8922.179,What would judge Rob Thes do?,363,,
1460,0.97,8922.179,8928.052,We get letters and counsel feeling that they are binding.,363,,
1461,0.97,8928.052,8947.872,Of course if Councilmembers were serious about Defunding the police they would be serve about people need to get organized to win with full powers over the police including hiring and firing and subpoena powers and policies and procedures.,363,,
1462,0.97,8947.872,8963.054,My observation for having 200 hours is in on broad spectrum and the people not sure about tee funding reset the powers of the police.,363,,
1463,0.97,8963.054,8967.124,It is not of accountability and the opposite.,363,,
1464,0.97,8967.124,8975.199,It shows a myriad of ways that political establishment protects the police.,363,,
1465,0.97,8975.199,8984.709,There are advocates that protect police and some are horrified by police violence and very much excuse for not following through.,363,,
1466,0.97,8984.709,8997.888,There are Federal courts who have defended the power of the ruling class against movement and ordinary people to the point of the dissent degree against violence is used to prevent grassroots violence.,363,,
1467,0.97,8997.888,9007.998,This is what it means P when the movement says we need system change and this is why I am a Socialist.,363,,
1468,0.97,9007.998,9019.477,"I voted against the bills, a $5.4 million police cut to a 4.5 police ad.",363,,
1469,0.97,9019.477,9034.725,"I will now vote no on this final bill, thank you.",363,,
1470,0.97,9034.725,9035.426,Any other comments.,363,,
1471,0.97,9035.426,9036.06,Counsel member Suarez.,364,,
1472,0.97,9036.06,9041.766,I will vote to support and I hope I say this right.,365,,
1473,0.97,9041.766,9046.404,Please correct me.,365,,
1474,0.97,9046.404,9048.105,I want to support Councilmember Herbold.,365,,
1475,0.97,9048.105,9071.429,You will figure that out but I want to say--I always respect what Councilmember Sawant has to share but in the real world we don't always have the luxury to talk about the political establishment or disagree all of the time with the Federal Court Judge or court monitor.,365,,
1476,0.97,9071.429,9082.573,And sometimes it is not realistic to just completely and decisively decide to wipe out a police Department.,365,,
1477,0.97,9082.573,9084.275,We have a charter to withhold.,365,,
1478,0.97,9084.275,9085.743,One officer or 12 officers.,365,,
1479,0.97,9085.743,9087.745,We have to have something there.,365,,
1480,0.97,9087.745,9103.994,What this Council has demonstrated in the last year is that public safety is community safety is more warriors and that doesn't make us more safe and I think we agree.,365,,
1481,0.97,9103.994,9111.735,There is no need to point fingers and call named and be called a Democrat establishment or whatever.,365,,
1482,0.97,9111.735,9130.821,"Meanwhile on earth, I just want to say this, the Councilmember Morales, I want to end this captain because I think it is caution as you have heard me say before a lot of trauma and I want to start the healing.",365,,
1483,0.97,9130.821,9142.6,I think Councilmember Morales with her hard work will allow us to close the chapter and begin a new one with Participatory budgeting.,365,,
1484,0.97,9142.6,9145.269,We are not Pitting one idea against the other.,365,,
1485,0.97,9145.269,9147.771,Both can be true and will continue to be true.,365,,
1486,0.97,9147.771,9155.613,We will continue to do that.,365,,
1487,0.97,9155.613,9159.717,As elected leaders we can't just happened to it a base or an echo Chamber.,365,,
1488,0.97,9159.717,9166.824,We have to represent all of Seattle and the needs of our city.,365,,
1489,0.97,9166.824,9179.537,If anything over this year what we have learned is that we will Reimagine and redirect funds from the police to upstream projects to take away from the harm that has happened in our community.,365,,
1490,0.97,9179.537,9180.104,Everyone Grays about that.,365,,
1491,0.97,9180.104,9186.477,For the first time what we are lending is we are finally learning to put together a plan.,365,,
1492,0.97,9186.477,9195.92,It is not perfect and not everyone will always agree.,365,,
1493,0.97,9195.92,9203.661,And I want to thank Councilmember Lewis to shift the $2 million over.,365,,
1494,0.97,9203.661,9213.404,These are conversations we were having a year ago or six months ago and we are through the leadership of everybody.,365,,
1495,0.97,9213.404,9223.147,I'm in the camp of closure and being decisive and being leader and making a decision and moving forward and on.,365,,
1496,0.97,9223.147,9232.222,I am also in the camp of believing in this great city and healing and that's how I am going to vote today.,365,,
1497,0.97,9232.222,9242.7,I think we have all been through a lot and I don't think it is good to continue the decisiveness.,365,,
1498,0.97,9242.7,9256.58,We have experienced different levels of frustration and I think Councilmember Lewis outlined some of that when people come to us and call us when they want camp Removals and they are upset about the homeless and police.,365,,
1499,0.97,9256.58,9262.72,I think that we have seen it in the city.,365,,
1500,0.97,9262.72,9271.528,And we have seen it nationally in this great city and across the nation and I am ready to turn the page and get stuff down.,365,,
1501,0.97,9271.528,9279.37,So I will leave it at that.,365,,
1502,0.97,9279.37,9279.67,Thank you.,365,,
1503,0.97,9279.67,9281.739,Thank you Councilmember Juarez.,366,,
1504,0.97,9281.739,9289.613,And next up Councilmember Morales.,366,,
1505,0.97,9289.613,9291.148,I will be brief.,367,,
1506,0.97,9291.148,9299.223,I voted twice in committee so I don't think my vote is a surprise here.,367,,
1507,0.97,9299.223,9307.665,I think this comes pack to the original intent of the bill that has been to hold the Department accountable for their overspending.,367,,
1508,0.97,9307.665,9326.65,They have already acknowledged that they could absorb the reduction through salary Savings and if they find later that they have additional needs they can bring it back to Council to request additional funds and that is how we hold the Department accountable.,367,,
1509,0.97,9326.65,9335.325,The only thing in their request that they are obliged to pay is the separation pay and salary savings can cover this.,367,,
1510,0.97,9335.325,9344.101,My feeling about this is that SPD created its own funding crisis when they decided to Overpend on overtime last summer.,367,,
1511,0.97,9344.101,9347.638,And giving the Department more funding won't prevent crime.,367,,
1512,0.97,9347.638,9351.675,It won't address homelessness or reduced substance abuse.,367,,
1513,0.97,9351.675,9356.747,It won't improve mental health outcomes for our community members.,367,,
1514,0.97,9356.747,9360.584,Only investing in community services will do that.,367,,
1515,0.97,9360.584,9378.736,"Our goal, I think CHA we share is investing public dollars in a way that can change condition conditions on the Brown so it needs to better health and Well- being for our neighbors and I Warding SP D for overspending outside of the budget author.",367,,
1516,0.97,9378.736,9393.851,I can't support this bill and will be voting which way it is that registers that disagreement.,367,,
1517,0.97,9393.851,9394.118,Okay.,368,,
1518,0.97,9394.118,9409.299,Some lack of procedural understanding as you all frame your thoughts here a Yes vote on Council bill whatever the bill is is an actual Yes vote on passage of the bill.,368,,
1519,0.97,9409.299,9419.042,A no vote is you're voting the bill down.,368,,
1520,0.97,9419.042,9420.644,Solook Councilmember Herbold is confused.,368,,
1521,0.97,9420.644,9423.58,She thinks she is supposed to vote no.,368,,
1522,0.97,9423.58,9429.586,I'm going to call upon the clerk.,368,,
1523,0.97,9429.586,9451.942,"My understanding is that there is a Recommenation from the committee to not pass the bill and my understanding that doesn't change a Yes or no vote Affectuates the passage of the bill, is it business as usually in terms of how we vote?",368,,
1524,0.97,9451.942,9465.522,It is confusing because the committee recommendation was to not pass but in order to bring it forward we had to make a motion to pass the bill.,369,,
1525,0.97,9465.522,9469.326,So the motion is to pass it as we had it amended.,369,,
1526,0.97,9469.326,9483.173,"If you are in favor of the bill you will vote to pass it but if you are opposed to the underlying bill, you are going to not which is what is the opposite out of committee but that is where we are at.",369,,
1527,0.97,9483.173,9484.475,I apologize for the confusion.,369,,
1528,0.97,9484.475,9485.108,"No, no, no.",370,,
1529,0.97,9485.108,9498.255,I just want to note for the record that my procedural Prowness and I remember the Queen of process.,370,,
1530,0.97,9498.255,9501.191,I feel that is a win already.,370,,
1531,0.97,9501.191,9508.165,If you want the bill to pass in spite of the committee recommendation.,370,,
1532,0.97,9508.165,9511.468,You are going to vote yes.,370,,
1533,0.97,9511.468,9511.668,Okay?,370,,
1534,0.97,9511.668,9525.816,If you want the bill to fail consistent with the committee's recommendation for a do not pass then will you vote no.,370,,
1535,0.97,9525.816,9526.316,You are the queen.,371,,
1536,0.97,9526.316,9527.551,Somebody send me a crown.,372,,
1537,0.97,9527.551,9533.724,Next up is I think hold on.,373,,
1538,0.97,9533.724,9536.126,Let me look.,373,,
1539,0.97,9536.126,9537.995,Councilmember Pedersen is next.,373,,
1540,0.97,9537.995,9539.763,Thank you Council President.,374,,
1541,0.97,9539.763,9550.574,I would like to thank Councilmember Herbold for her work as chair of public safety committee and her work to craft and compromise on this bill even though I am not in agreement on several elements.,374,,
1542,0.97,9550.574,9577.834,I just want to commend her for trying to work through this and come up with a compromise and echo the comments that Councilmember Juarez commented on.,374,,
1543,0.97,9577.834,9580.704,I can't approve until Council amendments are in place.,374,,
1544,0.97,9580.704,9590.581,It is complex and continues to reduce resources from the police Department at a time when we are seeing record attrition of officers.,374,,
1545,0.97,9590.581,9593.417,I will be voting no.,374,,
1546,0.97,9593.417,9601.825,I believe it is premature to label the loss of police officers as budgetary savings to be scooped away and spent elsewhere.,374,,
1547,0.97,9601.825,9607.197,The record-breaking a Trig of officers is alarming and response times on 911 calls are too long.,374,,
1548,0.97,9607.197,9636.46,By the end of the year I want to be sure that Department has the funds it needs to hire more crime prevention officers and to ramp up recruit many of officers and to implement the Federal decent decree Unheads the Warbles of the judge and monitors and to increase changing and return officers to community work instead working overtime on patrol.,374,,
1549,0.97,9636.46,9642.933,Talking about the proviso to free Umm dollars.,374,,
1550,0.97,9642.933,9646.737,While the intentions were positive.,374,,
1551,0.97,9646.737,9650.674,I believe this bill is a distraction.,374,,
1552,0.97,9650.674,9675.132,Despite the well intentions of amendments I believe this sends negative message to the safety field and it takes time and attention away from the most tasks on hand for the expensive contract with the Seattle police officers' Guild.,374,,
1553,0.97,9675.132,9694.184,I look forward to supporting the work of the labor relations policy committee to revise a police contract in a way that is positive and for the officers and the officers and Úsustainable justice.,374,,
1554,0.97,9694.184,9695.652,Thank you.,374,,
1555,0.97,9695.652,9696.787,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",375,,
1556,0.97,9696.787,9697.154,Thank you.,376,,
1557,0.97,9697.154,9699.923,I want to thank Councilmember Herbold.,376,,
1558,0.97,9699.923,9703.994,Thank you very much for the chair of public safety.,376,,
1559,0.97,9703.994,9720.977,You have taken the reins and we know that is no small Passk and months of work and named more difficult when the chief and the executive offices weigh in and when the judge and the court monitor weighed in.,376,,
1560,0.97,9720.977,9744.0,This legislation was intended to hold the city accountable for their spending and the intent was to use the Council's power of the first and the legislative ranch to ensure that executive agencies spends in the bound of the budget and to make sure there is a reckoning or balancing between this year's balance and the city and last year's Overspend.,376,,
1561,0.97,9744.0,9765.288,As we heard in the budget committee just last month it is very highly irregular for Council to be asked to authorize spending after the fact and to have a Retro active authority granted should be something uncommon and happen infrequent Le.,376,,
1562,0.97,9765.288,9769.593,That is not the practice as it relates to SPD.,376,,
1563,0.97,9769.593,9792.115,Not only is it highly irregular and out of alignment in the 3532A that says there shall be no authorizations allowances contracts and payments made or attempted to be made in excess of the expenditures authorized in the budget or modified and any attempt shall be void.,376,,
1564,0.97,9792.115,9797.287,That is what the Rcw says and what happened last year.,376,,
1565,0.97,9797.287,9804.561,And so the proviso that we put in place were ignored and dismissed by the city at the time.,376,,
1566,0.97,9804.561,9819.342,And instead what planning was authorized for last year was the priority that the Council did not want to see Prioritized and what it left for funding was things that Council wanted Prioritized like payment for family leave and benefits and severance.,376,,
1567,0.97,9819.342,9828.018,They are items that we could not pay.,376,,
1568,0.97,9828.018,9829.92,So the Council authorized those payments.,376,,
1569,0.97,9829.92,9847.904,That total was 5.4 million and a desire and I think there continues to be a desire by me that this year's budget Rectifies that Overspend and this year's budget corrections for that in terms of the debt from last last year.,376,,
1570,0.97,9847.904,9859.216,The $5.4 million number is not arbitrary and comes from the following three items in last year's Overspend.,376,,
1571,0.97,9859.216,9869.125,$1.9 million reimbursement and 1.9 million in pay backs and 1.96 million in separation pay.,376,,
1572,0.97,9869.125,9874.831,All of it means the importance of pay and this money paid money on items that we heard about during testimony today.,376,,
1573,0.97,9874.831,9890.914,We have seen the videos and heard from first hand account and Thes of where people had been met with excessive force for expressing the first amendment right and that is the protests that were taken place a year ago this week.,376,,
1574,0.97,9890.914,9898.622,The testimonials today constitute a make shift tribunal on what was experienced at the time of the protests a year ago.,376,,
1575,0.97,9898.622,9915.839,And we remain I think as a Council committed to making sure that there is accountability for those pieces and not only accountability for the Overspend in the budget but for the accountability situation that we continue to hear about on a daily basis and outer lined in today's public testimony.,376,,
1576,0.97,9915.839,9935.258,We remain in the midst of Federal Da scent degree that is a decade old and committed to addressing the call for action from the folks that have been calling in for over a year to make sure that we align.,376,,
1577,0.97,9935.258,9945.168,We Realign our program to social services and mental health and traffic Infractions we won't have armed officers show up.,376,,
1578,0.97,9945.168,9972.996,The Council has important efforts led by Councilmember Herbold and I appreciate that those initial investments were made to Realign our values to what the community has been calling for and to divest in areas that have been Overinvested in over the year.,376,,
1579,0.97,9972.996,9985.275,We are trying to balance the $5.4 million addition that Council has made and remove it from the budget and that will have calls from the court and monitor and judge.,376,,
1580,0.97,9985.275,9990.914,I think that made this bill a little bit out of alignment of what we were doing.,376,,
1581,0.97,9990.914,10011.735,I disagreed with the concerns and the court and the monitor and I hope that court and court monitor do listen to the public testimony that was provided today through the quasi tribunal.,376,,
1582,0.97,10011.735,10016.639,The Council has mot put SPD in a position not to respond to emergency calls.,376,,
1583,0.97,10016.639,10026.082,And that Department does have the resources to fulfill the full hiring plan as we funded last year.,376,,
1584,0.97,10026.082,10032.655,Central staff memo does the math and shows it is funded and 13 million in salaries over the course of this year.,376,,
1585,0.97,10032.655,10047.07,I think it is important to continue to remember that SP D caring plan as requested by the Mayor and the immediate is in place and it can be what was noted to be reasonably accomplished was fully funded.,376,,
1586,0.97,10047.07,10091.047,"Through the process we have learned that due to continue attrition rates that 13 million savings is anticipated and hopeful with the bill if it does not pass today that we can direct those funds, those 13 million to things that I think are common agreements to what the bill offers and what we would like to see and quick response and accurate and adequate response to the public records request and making sure more funds go to the officers and I.T.",376,,
1587,0.97,10091.047,10095.084,There would still be over 5 million in unspent dollars at the end of the year.,376,,
1588,0.97,10095.084,10114.27,I think today's testimony was very helpful and heart breaking that this story has continued to surface about the violence and I do hope that this testimony in today will help to paint a full picture of the issues.,376,,
1589,0.97,10114.27,10120.777,But Unfortunately on this bill I would be voting no because I am concerned about the $5 Millionpro Viteo.,376,,
1590,0.97,10120.777,10127.15,I am concern that there is not a full $5.4 million Teapot.,376,,
1591,0.97,10127.15,10129.619,I appreciate that $3 million.,376,,
1592,0.97,10129.619,10154.644,And I will continue to work my colleagues and look forward to working in the community to make sure that we are holding accountable the Department that Overspent their budget that they are supposed to stay within and that we continue the evidences to Reimagine and reinvest in community services and decrease the services in which a armed officer is showing up.,376,,
1593,0.97,10154.644,10165.588,"The city of Seattle, New York, Los Angeles are among the four cities held up towards Reimagining and that work is not done and we will continue to do that even after today.",376,,
1594,0.97,10165.588,10186.075,I appreciate the work that has gone into this and recognize incredible obstacles that the chair has had to address while considering the legislation and appreciate the work.,376,,
1595,0.97,10186.075,10187.51,Into thank you.,376,,
1596,0.97,10187.51,10192.615,Any other comments to the bill?,376,,
1597,0.97,10192.615,10192.815,Okay.,376,,
1598,0.97,10192.815,10193.917,Colleagues I wanted to quickly make remarks.,376,,
1599,0.97,10193.917,10199.455,I do want to like so many others have.,376,,
1600,0.97,10199.455,10205.929,Start by acknowledging Councilmember Herbold's work over the last several months to make progress.,376,,
1601,0.97,10205.929,10215.705,This legislation has tried to developed a well reasoned approach to this budget action that Council has literally been considering since December.,376,,
1602,0.97,10215.705,10228.985,I do appreciate her willingness to engage all of the parties that have expressed concern or interest in the legislation over the past several months.,376,,
1603,0.97,10228.985,10237.794,That includes community advocates and the monitor and Department of justice representative as well as members of the human services committee.,376,,
1604,0.97,10237.794,10250.506,I think that it appears that almost all of the Stakeholders involved in the budget act or who have interest in the budget action appear to be dissatisfied with the current legislation.,376,,
1605,0.97,10250.506,10261.751,I don't think that is a reflection on Councilmember Herbold's policy work and effort to get us a piece of legislation that we could potentially support.,376,,
1606,0.97,10261.751,10279.535,I do think it is the reflection and the result of quite simply the is that exists here and the issue of policing and their budget.,376,,
1607,0.97,10279.535,10290.346,Despite Councilmember Herbold's intention to vote on this bill I will vote consistent with my bill in vote which is committee that is a vote against the bill.,376,,
1608,0.97,10290.346,10299.789,As Iic Presenced during the safety committee during the discussion of this bill.,376,,
1609,0.97,10299.789,10328.217,I feel primarily it is premature to make several of the budget actions that the bill pro Moses we compromise on including cuts to the police Department a budget that the monitor has raised significant concerns and it is important that we have further engagement with the monitor to provide an explanation about how we will impact or not the Department's ongoing operations and specifically with the staffing plans.,376,,
1610,0.97,10328.217,10331.421,It of course puts the $5.4 million on the proviso staffing plan.,376,,
1611,0.97,10331.421,10336.959,I think it is too early to lift or begin the process of lifting the proviso.,376,,
1612,0.97,10336.959,10342.365,In order to give the city additional flexibility.,376,,
1613,0.97,10342.365,10364.921,I would like to continue to have significant disagreements about leadership and how they manage the budget including overtime and I continue to leave that this proviso serves an important role as accountability mechanism and the Council needs to retain this $5 million proviso in place.,376,,
1614,0.97,10364.921,10371.561,So we can ensure the Department is not expanding resources that were set by this Council.,376,,
1615,0.97,10371.561,10383.506,The more appropriate time to consider that will be in the fall budget when we have a better understanding and more understanding of what the Council's process will be.,376,,
1616,0.97,10383.506,10390.613,We know the executive will be back with proposed changes later this year.,376,,
1617,0.97,10390.613,10399.322,That is costs with substances and events and overtime and paid rein verse many.,376,,
1618,0.97,10399.322,10403.926,These are issues to be addressed via the supplemental ordinance.,376,,
1619,0.97,10403.926,10418.808,Months for now when the Council is making decisions on the city's budget we will have more flexibility to take action if the proviso is in place and if any of the Provisos are in place.,376,,
1620,0.97,10418.808,10425.448,I will vote consistent with the committee vote that is a no vote on the Council bill.,376,,
1621,0.97,10425.448,10426.916,Do appreciate everybody's hard work.,376,,
1622,0.97,10426.916,10434.824,Not easy and I know that we are reaching our votes for some reasons and some other reasons.,376,,
1623,0.97,10434.824,10440.062,But I hope we can continue to move forward on this really Citical issue together.,376,,
1624,0.97,10440.062,10466.756,"With that being said, I am going to hand it to Councilmember Herbold to close out the debate to call this bill to a recall call.",377,,
1625,0.97,10481.47,10484.574,I appreciate the testimony and regret these experiences in the city.,378,,
1626,0.97,10484.574,10498.221,I do want to say that this is another issue that is under the Purview of the dissent decree.,378,,
1627,0.97,10498.221,10508.998,The Council adopted a legislation over weapons and they criticized the legislation for not protecting public safety.,378,,
1628,0.97,10508.998,10512.635,The legislation under the dissent decree requires approval.,378,,
1629,0.97,10512.635,10516.973,Barreling ahead in this instance means that nothing has happened.,378,,
1630,0.97,10516.973,10521.143,We have no ban or regulations on lethal weapons.,378,,
1631,0.97,10521.143,10527.617,Going ahead with the budget bills risk the same outcome that no budget will happen.,378,,
1632,0.97,10527.617,10533.356,In my opinion colleagues vote not about a political win on either side.,378,,
1633,0.97,10533.356,10545.902,Those that don't support any cut don't like this bill and those that want the cut to be bigger don't like it either.,378,,
1634,0.97,10545.902,10549.305,This bill is not a number.,378,,
1635,0.97,10549.305,10575.364,It is to exercise physical oversight while simultaneously funding important safety investments and in areas where there was broad agreement and heeding the authority of the consent decree where the court is suggesting actions overlap.,378,,
1636,0.97,10575.364,10587.743,Despite the fact that the majority of members voted in favor of the amendment on May 11th and in favor of substituting the original bill for a smaller budget reduction in March.,378,,
1637,0.97,10587.743,10607.763,Over the summer and fall budget cycle the Council listened to people calling for 50% cut to the Seattle police budget and listened to people that opposed it and demonstrated to listen to multiple voices in the city and compromise to meet our objective to redefine public safety in our city.,378,,
1638,0.97,10607.763,10614.236,The ability to listen to multiple voices is critical to change moving forward.,378,,
1639,0.97,10614.236,10618.741,To Councilmember Mosqueda's point to request for funding after the fact should be rare.,378,,
1640,0.97,10618.741,10619.008,I agree.,378,,
1641,0.97,10619.008,10622.211,And it is June.,378,,
1642,0.97,10622.211,10640.963,That is why the technology needs funding.,378,,
1643,0.97,10640.963,10668.124,"This is not a full lift but a gradual lift as we get reports from SPD and respectfully this was in the amendment supported back in March that we--the majority of committee members voted in favor of bringing it in front of us and if there was concerns about that approach, I would happily consider a different approach had I known.",378,,
1644,0.97,10668.124,10676.332,"The highest spending is during the summer and as we found out during the process, most of the money will have been spent.",378,,
1645,0.97,10676.332,10689.445,"With your vote, please do not allow those that don't want us to exercise oversight of SP D's budget as well as those votes that advocate for all or nothing approach to revert us back.",378,,
1646,0.97,10689.445,10696.152,If this bill does not pass there is no budget cuts at all.,378,,
1647,0.97,10696.152,10715.104,Councilmembers that wish to support the investments in the bill and I urge you to vote yes.,378,,
1648,0.97,10715.104,10715.805,Thank you.,378,,
1649,0.97,10715.805,10718.24,And that does stop the debate.,378,,
1650,0.97,10718.24,10719.942,I will ask to close.,378,,
1651,0.97,10719.942,10740.329,Call the roll on the passage of the bill as amended.,378,,
1652,0.97,10740.83,10744.066,Herbold.,378,,
