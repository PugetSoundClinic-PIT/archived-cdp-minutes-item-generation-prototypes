0,0.97,19.386,27.16,"Thank you so much, all right, good afternoon everyone.",0,,
1,0.97,27.16,40.874,"Welcome to the May 11 2021 Governance and education committee meeting, we are now in order, I am chair of the committee, with the clerk please call the roll.",0,,

3,0.97,53.086,71.204,I do want to make a note for the record that I received a note from Councilmember Sawant that you cannot make it today.,2,,
4,0.97,71.204,73.206,If there is no objection the agenda will be adopted.,2,,
5,0.97,73.206,81.915,Hearing no objection the objection is adopted.,2,,
6,0.97,81.915,84.217,"I was locked up, I was screaming that I'm here.",3,,
7,0.97,84.217,88.588,"Thank you, sorry.",3,,
8,0.97,88.588,91.424,I hate that part when you are sitting in the waiting room.,4,,
9,0.97,91.424,93.126,Does anybody see me?,4,,
10,0.97,93.126,98.932,"We will have the record reflect that you have joined us just in time, thank you for being here.",4,,
11,0.97,98.932,106.372,We are going to look at the public comment sheet.,4,,
12,0.97,106.372,113.146,I will not subject everybody through the script if we don't have anybody up for public comment.,4,,
13,0.97,113.146,117.117,And I do not see anyone signed up on the public comment sheet.,4,,
14,0.97,117.117,120.153,So I'm just looking to confirm that there is not anybody.,4,,
15,0.97,120.153,123.256,There are no public comment registrants.,5,,
16,0.97,123.256,134.667,"Great, so we will close out public comment given there is nobody in the waiting room to give us public comment.",6,,
17,0.97,134.667,137.137,We can move on to other items of business on our agenda.,6,,
18,0.97,137.137,145.145,"First is item one, with the clerk please read item one into the record.",6,,
19,0.97,145.145,164.464,"Agenda item number one, council vote 12066, commonly referred to as the ordinance for the civil servants for the discretionary paper files in the section 4.1 3.00.",7,,
20,0.97,164.464,166.9,Thank you so much.,8,,
21,0.97,166.9,173.907,I am going to go ahead and introduce this legislation briefly.,8,,
22,0.97,173.907,182.749,This is a routine legislation before us today to address some personnel actions that require legislative action.,8,,
23,0.97,182.749,195.828,And so I am excited to host members of the Seattle Department of human resources and our own analyst to discuss this a particular item.,8,,
24,0.97,195.828,206.94,So I will ask for folks to introduce themselves for the record starting with Karina and then if you can just Popcorn it amongst each other that would be wonderful.,8,,
25,0.97,206.94,210.21,So can you start off for us.,8,,
26,0.97,210.21,216.015,I am Karina Boll and I am with the Council central staff.,9,,
27,0.97,216.015,227.026,"I am Sarah Butler, policy and legislator adviser to the Seattle Department of human resources.",10,,
28,0.97,227.026,235.401,"I am Lisa Gardner, I am the compensation program manager under the Seattle Department of human resources.",11,,
29,0.97,235.401,240.473,I'm with the Seattle Department of human resources.,12,,
30,0.97,240.473,241.074,Welcome everyone.,13,,
31,0.97,241.074,243.81,Thank you for introducing yourselves.,13,,
32,0.97,243.81,250.55,And I will hand it over to you Karina to give a little introduction and that we will hear from the Department.,13,,
33,0.97,250.55,261.694,This legislation which is known as the first quarter employment ordinance is legislation that the Seattle Department of human resources transmits up to four times a year.,14,,
34,0.97,261.694,269.769,And it takes care of or implements personnel actions that require legislation to happen.,14,,
35,0.97,269.769,277.243,"Examples of those kinds of personnel actions can include Civil-Service classification, and reclassification.",14,,
36,0.97,277.243,294.594,"This particular legislation does a little bit of all of those things and it would return six positions to the civil service system in a number of departments like the community police Commission, public utilities, and municipal wards.",14,,
37,0.97,294.594,301.701,It would also adjust the pay bands of three job titles in the legislative Department.,14,,
38,0.97,301.701,305.071,It would reclassify two exam positions.,14,,
39,0.97,305.071,314.514,"So for those positions, one of them for example is currently titled an executive assistant and would be reclassified to executive assistant senior.",14,,
40,0.97,314.514,340.073,"And a quick word about Civil- service in case folks are not familiar with that, it is a classification that is basically the default classification for city employees that provide a range of job protections, requires varied based hiring, so not just appointment.",14,,
41,0.97,340.073,350.783,"And employees who are Civil- service covered have a Probationary period where they can be fired for any reason, and after that Probationary period, they can only be fired for cause.",14,,
42,0.97,350.783,360.46,There has to be a rule they have broken in order to be terminated and it would have to be progressive discipline before termination Happene.,14,,
43,0.97,360.46,382.415,"So the only position or job titles that are exempt include those declared in the Charter and they would include positions like Commission, staff, city attorneys and some others as well.",14,,
44,0.97,382.415,396.529,"There's also a municipal code 4.1.3, which list a number of other job classifications that are exempt such as temporary workers and library employees and a whole range of other positions as well.",14,,
45,0.97,396.529,416.649,Typically the director has the power or authority to recommend when certain positions should be made Civil-Service exempt or covered by Civil-Service if not already determined by the charter.,14,,
46,0.97,416.649,417.884,So that is a brief introduction.,14,,
47,0.97,417.884,425.525,Then we have some subject matter experts at the table as well.,14,,
48,0.97,425.525,429.362,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.",15,,
49,0.97,429.362,431.264,"Sarah, Lisa or Alaina, anything to add?",15,,
50,0.97,431.264,443.476,"I just have one verification on the third item, the action doesn't read classifying, just as updating the record to reflect the new job title.",16,,
51,0.97,443.476,448.948,Otherwise I think Karina did a great job of summarizing this legislation.,16,,
52,0.97,448.948,457.49,"Anything else from our hr folks, all right, see none.",17,,
53,0.97,457.49,463.596,I have just a few questions to make sure we get this information on the record.,17,,
54,0.97,463.596,487.587,"Just generally, for the folks over at Hds are, how does the Department determine how to restore Civil-Service protections to a position if that were to occur?",17,,
55,0.97,487.587,498.331,I will go hide and take this.,18,,
56,0.97,498.331,519.552,The compensation reclassification unit staff receives requests from various departments to review positions and as a part of that we also review their Civil-Service exempt status when positions are exempt or not exempt and they are being requested to be exempt.,18,,
57,0.97,519.552,526.993,And we look at the criteria that are defined in the municipal code and in the personnel rules.,18,,
58,0.97,526.993,535.835,We do a thorough job analysis to determine the appropriate allocation.,18,,
59,0.97,535.835,544.076,"Whether they meet the criteria for Civil-Service exemption based on the standards outlined, or they don't.",18,,
60,0.97,544.076,548.147,And so it goes both ways.,18,,
61,0.97,548.147,567.3,"When positions change significantly where they no longer meet the threshold to maintain the Civil-Service exemption based on the identified criteria, then we bring them forward as a return to Civil-Service.",18,,
62,0.97,567.3,567.9,"Okay, got it.",19,,
63,0.97,567.9,578.077,"I have a few other questions for you, but you answered them in the context of answering that one big general question.",19,,
64,0.97,578.077,581.514,So I don't have to ask you the additional three questions I had listed on my script.,19,,
65,0.97,581.514,583.582,So thank you for doing that.,19,,
66,0.97,583.582,588.321,So any comments or questions on the bill?,19,,
67,0.97,588.321,598.664,"And just to confirm with the hr folks, this will not result in any layoffs, Furloughs or job losses.",19,,
68,0.97,598.664,605.037,This is just a technical list of classifications.,19,,
69,0.97,605.037,609.709,"That is correct, there are no negative impacts in this legislation.",20,,
70,0.97,609.709,612.211,Any questions or comments?,21,,
71,0.97,612.211,622.321,"All right, hearing none, I will move that the committee move passage of the bill.",21,,
72,0.97,622.321,623.122,Is there a second?,21,,
73,0.97,623.122,631.964,"It has been moved and Seconded, are there any final comments?",21,,
74,0.97,631.964,650.983,"I understand having worked for the previous chair of this body of work, that this can seem like a very broad or not exciting legislation.",22,,
75,0.97,650.983,655.588,I just want to highlight that it is incredibly important in keeping accurate and Up-To- date.,22,,
76,0.97,655.588,661.761,And I want to thank everyone for doing the important work that you do.,22,,
77,0.97,661.761,667.7,Thank you all for being here.,22,,
78,0.97,667.7,671.971,"Thank you Councilmember Strauss, any other final comments?",23,,
79,0.97,671.971,689.155,"Hearing none, with the clerk please call the role on the committee recommendation that Council bill 120066 be passed and forwarded to the full city council.",23,,
80,0.97,689.155,699.598,"[roll call] that is four in favor, not opposed.",24,,
81,0.97,699.598,709.642,"Thank you, the motion carries and the recommendation is that the Council bill be passed and would be considered at our may 17th city council meeting.",25,,
82,0.97,709.642,722.455,"Thank you so much Karina and folks over at hr for joining us for this fairly routine legislation, I appreciate your patience and I appreciate you being here with us.",25,,
83,0.97,722.455,726.892,You are welcome to of course exit the meeting into other important work.,25,,
84,0.97,726.892,727.626,Thank you so much.,25,,
85,0.97,727.626,731.964,With the clerk please read item two into the record.,25,,
86,0.97,731.964,740.206,Childcare access challenges and strategies for Home-Based and Center-Based facilities.,26,,
87,0.97,740.206,745.778,Thank you so much.,27,,
88,0.97,745.778,754.286,"Colleagues, I am really excited to have this panel here with us today.",27,,
89,0.97,754.286,760.826,"This panel is for us to do a deep dive into Childcare facilities, both Home-Based and Center-Based care in the city of Seattle.",27,,
90,0.97,760.826,772.104,"Childcar is an important issue to many people in the city of Seattle, myself included.",27,,
91,0.97,772.104,776.408,And over the course of the pandemic we learn just how crucial access to Childcare is for everyone in our city.,27,,
92,0.97,776.408,780.613,Childcare is infrastructure.,27,,
93,0.97,780.613,782.148,And yet finding Childcare is incredibly challenging.,27,,
94,0.97,782.148,789.722,My own experience for searching for Childcare meant visiting a lot of providers.,27,,
95,0.97,789.722,800.399,"And, sadly, very few culturally Childcare options were Opriate available in my own neighborhood here in West Seattle.",27,,
96,0.97,800.399,809.141,I know this experience is not unique but it is one shared by thousands of people and families in our city.,27,,
97,0.97,809.141,819.351,"And as a vaccine efforts are underway, my office is hearing more and more about the need for Childcare for positions to be able to return to work.",27,,
98,0.97,819.351,830.663,It is my hope that part of the recovery can and will focus on the Prioritizing the Much- needed increase of access to affordable Childcare throughout our city.,27,,
99,0.97,830.663,839.772,For the rest of today's committee we are going to dive into some of these challenges with Childcare facilities and Childcare issues in general.,27,,
100,0.97,839.772,851.116,We will also hopefully identify some opportunities and strategies that may be helpful now for some investment in action by the Seattle city council.,27,,
101,0.97,851.116,863.963,"So with that, we will hear first from a Community-Based providers and advocates in our community panel to share their first-hand challenges with Childcare facilities.",27,,
102,0.97,863.963,880.579,After that we will ask what the city currently does with Childcare facilities and infrastructure's within our city.,27,,
103,0.97,880.579,882.481,So I will hand it over to the panelists.,27,,
104,0.97,882.481,889.889,We will start with introductions from our panelists.,27,,
105,0.97,889.889,892.791,What we start with Casey and we can head down the line.,27,,
106,0.97,892.791,900.399,"Thank you, I am from the Haggard Childcare resources.",28,,
107,0.97,900.399,912.344,We've been winning Childcare programs for about four years and we currently have about eight schools with the 600 families.,28,,
108,0.97,912.344,914.246,And about 1200 families are on a waiting list.,28,,
109,0.97,914.246,915.881,So I know those challenges.,28,,
110,0.97,915.881,917.516,Thank you for letting me be here.,28,,
111,0.97,917.516,919.418,Thank you for being here for the introduction.,29,,
112,0.97,919.418,923.255,It's hear from Nicole.,29,,
113,0.97,923.255,929.428,I am and early head start lead for Childcare resource.,30,,
114,0.97,929.428,943.976,"Prior to that I was a coach lead and did coaching for about four years, supporting about hundred 80 providers in Childcare and Childcare centers.",30,,
115,0.97,943.976,945.778,Thank you for having me here.,30,,
116,0.97,945.778,949.948,To make thank you for accepting our invitation.,30,,
117,0.97,949.948,956.288,Next up is Kathy green.,30,,
118,0.97,956.288,961.193,"Hi, my name is Kathy green.",31,,
119,0.97,961.193,972.237,I am a member of SCI United five and also a family home Healthcare provider.,31,,
120,0.97,972.237,973.672,Thank you for being here with us.,32,,
121,0.97,973.672,978.31,Who wants to start on the community panel here?,32,,
122,0.97,978.31,984.316,I would be happy to start.,33,,
123,0.97,984.316,984.717,Taken away.,34,,
124,0.97,984.717,991.89,"I don't have recommendations for you, but I do have our recent project we are working on.",35,,
125,0.97,991.89,1002.735,I hope it can highlight some of the challenges that are specific to Seattle.,35,,
126,0.97,1002.735,1004.636,And maybe just give you information to explore further.,35,,
127,0.97,1004.636,1010.142,We have been writing programs in Seattle for over 40 years.,35,,
128,0.97,1010.142,1025.19,"And this past summer we were notified that our Seattle children's program that we've been running for 18 years, that with their budgetary concerns, they were choosing to close this summer.",35,,
129,0.97,1025.19,1034.633,So leaving 85 families that are all Healthcare providers without Childcare in the middle of the pandemic.,35,,
130,0.97,1034.633,1041.94,So we really rallied together with our family community and decided to take this and relocate it as an independent organization.,35,,
131,0.97,1041.94,1055.788,"And so we have a new facility, we have contractors and we are currently wrestling through the challenges of the city process.",35,,
132,0.97,1055.788,1067.099,So really the primary driver of our challenges that are directly tied to the city of Seattle processes are the definition of substantial alteration.,35,,
133,0.97,1067.099,1081.647,"And substantial alteration could be if you have 50% of your building destroyed and you are rebuilding, or if your cost of renovations are more than the total value of the building.",35,,
134,0.97,1081.647,1090.989,"In our case, it is only being triggered because we are increasing the hazard level of our occupancy.",35,,
135,0.97,1090.989,1093.225,We are going from an office building to a Childcare center.,35,,
136,0.97,1093.225,1098.33,And really what this means with the substantial alteration is that we need to bring everything in the building up to current code.,35,,
137,0.97,1098.33,1101.233,And we have to do of old design review.,35,,
138,0.97,1101.233,1109.842,"And so in both cases, this really is driving some substantial increases in the time and cost of this project.",35,,
139,0.97,1109.842,1121.553,"And when we look at a cost like trying to expand Childcare in Seattle, everyone is facing that same limiting factor.",35,,
140,0.97,1121.553,1143.942,"So in our case, what we initially anticipated to be about an $800,000 renovation to a building, which could really be done through normal tenant improvements like adding toilets, SINKS and walls for classroom Dividers, has turned into an over $2 million project.",35,,
141,0.97,1143.942,1152.885,"And when we think about expansion, we are adding 104 Childcare spaces.",35,,
142,0.97,1152.885,1157.022,"A costs $20,000 per licensed spot.",35,,
143,0.97,1157.022,1161.994,"And I think by all measures, when you look at this, this is a terrible business decision.",35,,
144,0.97,1161.994,1169.668,"And over the 15 years of our lease, we will never recoup this investment.",35,,
145,0.97,1169.668,1181.947,"So we are educators first and business operators second, and if we were not, we would not be doing this.",35,,
146,0.97,1181.947,1199.064,"So adding to that cost of the Timeline is working through, and I understand that they are overwhelmed with demand and Covid has really presented some challenges with their own remote work, it has just been a very frustrating experience.",35,,
147,0.97,1199.064,1213.445,So throughout this process we have secured first available dates with Sdci for Resubmittal meetings and that has been a total of six months of waiting.,35,,
148,0.97,1213.445,1222.354,And once we get our plans and to do a full design review driven by this substantial alteration definition that is another 16 weeks.,35,,
149,0.97,1222.354,1235.434,"So in total we are waiting 10 months, 10 full months of paying rent at this time, sitting and waiting to be able to create Childcare.",35,,
150,0.97,1235.434,1236.468,And that is really hard.,35,,
151,0.97,1236.468,1244.776,"And for small businesses like ours, or even smaller businesses like Kathy's, this is not something that we can do.",35,,
152,0.97,1244.776,1251.917,The prospect of opening a new school is very daunting and in many ways it's completely Infeasible.,35,,
153,0.97,1251.917,1258.19,"And with the additional challenges of working through the substantial alteration, it is nearly impossible.",35,,
154,0.97,1258.19,1276.642,"So, I know this is a brief and I hope it helps illustrate some of the barriers that the Council can help address and create a path for in facilitating and rather injuring the extension of Childcare capacity.",35,,
155,0.97,1276.642,1277.909,I am available for any questions.,35,,
156,0.97,1277.909,1282.18,Thank you Casey.,36,,
157,0.97,1282.18,1285.717,"Really, astounding numbers and Timelines here.",36,,
158,0.97,1285.717,1295.794,So I would be looking forward to hearing from Sdci and getting their thoughts on some of these Timelines.,36,,
159,0.97,1295.794,1302.134,"And related costs, we are looking forward to hearing some reaction from them as well.",36,,
160,0.97,1302.134,1310.242,"Colleagues, any questions for Casey?",36,,
161,0.97,1310.242,1315.947,Or comments.,36,,
162,0.97,1315.947,1317.349,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",36,,
163,0.97,1317.349,1327.759,"I just wanted to double check, thanks for the summary on this page.",37,,
164,0.97,1327.759,1333.565,"Is there any of these delays and costs that are not city specific, or is this all city specific Timelines?",37,,
165,0.97,1333.565,1350.949,"So when we first got to the point where a lease was feasible on this location, the very first meeting we got with Sdci to really determine feasibility took 56 days.",38,,
166,0.97,1350.949,1352.017,That was the first available meeting.,38,,
167,0.97,1352.017,1355.253,We could have done it the next day.,38,,
168,0.97,1355.253,1374.74,"And then, once we were able to determine that this was feasible and we would be able to put a Childcare center in this location for both Land-Use and building code, 126 days was the very first plan intake meeting available.",38,,
169,0.97,1374.74,1383.615,And so we reached out to the director and a number of Councilmembers who assisted.,38,,
170,0.97,1383.615,1393.325,"And we got a response from Sdci and they said they would try to get our plans in earlier for review, if available.",38,,
171,0.97,1393.325,1398.13,But they could not guarantee anything.,38,,
172,0.97,1398.13,1418.116,"So I feel a little frustrated, in my mind and imagination I am sitting behind a bunch of developers, waiting and we are at the end of this very long Queue and there is no way to Prioritize human service Oganizations.",38,,
173,0.97,1418.116,1424.823,And there is no priority process available.,38,,
174,0.97,1424.823,1430.962,To get this done any quicker.,38,,
175,0.97,1430.962,1462.661,"So the cost we are seeing on this slide, I guess what we are trying to figure out is, in terms of the delay you are identifying, right, sort out the cities processes creating a long runway in terms of feasibility and planning and breaking ground and getting going, right?",39,,
176,0.97,1462.661,1478.577,"To these costs that we see here, are they are costs specifically tied with it that delay, or are there costs included in this slide that would have been incurred Úregardless of the Sdci process",39,,
177,0.97,1478.577,1484.816,Most of these costs are regardless of the deleted Timeline.,40,,
178,0.97,1484.816,1490.522,There are certainly some real costs associated with the delay.,40,,
179,0.97,1490.522,1497.629,"We are paying $25,000 a month in rent throughout this process.",40,,
180,0.97,1497.629,1507.939,"For Childcare that makes the sort of low single digit profit margins, it makes a huge impact.",40,,
181,0.97,1507.939,1512.677,There are a number of costs associated with these code upgrades.,40,,
182,0.97,1512.677,1518.95,"And we understand that it would not be intelligent to say we would sacrifice any life safety code upgrades, right?",40,,
183,0.97,1518.95,1531.897,"We need to upgrade Childcare facilities to current code, for any life safety issues.",40,,
184,0.97,1531.897,1535.233,"Structural, the whole gambit of things.",40,,
185,0.97,1535.233,1545.51,There were some interesting costs associated with those code upgrades that we were not really anticipating.,40,,
186,0.97,1545.51,1551.683,This building that we are using was built in 1975.,40,,
187,0.97,1551.683,1559.824,And in 2000 and structural analysis was done and it was in compliance with FEMA guidelines.,40,,
188,0.97,1559.824,1565.697,"But because of the substantial alteration and doing the full code review, they have to do a full structural analysis.",40,,
189,0.97,1565.697,1571.736,"And just to get a structural engineer to do that was $85,000.",40,,
190,0.97,1571.736,1578.209,"We are not doing significant work inside, we are putting sheer walls in.",40,,
191,0.97,1578.209,1581.212,"But just those pieces are another $200,000.",40,,
192,0.97,1581.212,1598.73,"The city would not allow us to add a water main, and so we are having to do this kind of Funky water connection to be able to support a sprinkler system.",40,,
193,0.97,1598.73,1600.799,"Which it is $100,000 to put a sprinkler system in.",40,,
194,0.97,1600.799,1602.834,"Another $100,000 to hook it up to the city water.",40,,
195,0.97,1602.834,1609.708,"So a lot of these costs, yes, we would have to incur them anyway.",40,,
196,0.97,1609.708,1617.582,There were some unanticipated costs associated with the code upgrades.,40,,
197,0.97,1617.582,1624.055,"And, you know, we are a little company.",40,,
198,0.97,1624.055,1633.264,We don't have a team that does this.,40,,
199,0.97,1633.264,1638.236,We are dealing with the parents in the morning and then dealing with this in the afternoon.,40,,
200,0.97,1638.236,1648.68,"So, going into it, there are some real costs associated with this kind of upgrade in that long time period with Sdci.",40,,
201,0.97,1648.68,1673.004,"Yes, and we have been hearing a lot about sort of the the real cost associated, Israel and we just sort of dealt with that issue in their transportation Committee in terms of lifting up was a big Úconcern for a lot of folks in the city.",41,,
202,0.97,1673.004,1675.507,So I appreciate that.,41,,
203,0.97,1675.507,1678.977,Everyone is equally impacted by that reality.,41,,
204,0.97,1678.977,1680.612,Councilmember Strauss?,41,,
205,0.97,1680.612,1687.018,Thank you Council president and thank you Casey for presenting this.,42,,
206,0.97,1687.018,1719.751,"Your NOTE about 56 days for the first available Pre-Sub meetng, you said you were ready to go the next day, that is a topic of investigation that we are taking up with our Land-Use committee and with Sdci in looking at how do we goal set better and how do we ensure that each of their permitting notes has the staffing they need to be able to quickly and effectively turnaround permits.",42,,
207,0.97,1719.751,1736.701,"I don't know if this would have applied to you, but should you have had to go through a conditional use permit, that would have been another delay and we've already addressed that through the Childcare review for the Childcare facilities.",42,,
208,0.97,1736.701,1764.796,"And I think you bring up a good point that issues of importance such as housing and Childcare, we do need to find a Pathway to ensure that there is a Timeline for the permits while at the same time not pushing everyone else out the back door.",42,,
209,0.97,1764.796,1769.134,"This is really helpful information and helps me do my job better with Sdci, having this first-hand information on record.",42,,
210,0.97,1769.134,1780.311,"So also think you for bringing this to the committee today, and Casey, please do reach out to my office anytime you'd like to talk about this.",42,,
211,0.97,1780.311,1786.851,"Any other questions for KC, colleagues?",43,,
212,0.97,1786.851,1793.691,I have a feeling this will be a bit of a theme.,43,,
213,0.97,1793.691,1799.33,We will hear a little bit of the same from Nicole and Kathy as well.,43,,
214,0.97,1799.33,1803.935,"Nicole, I understand you are next in the Queue.",43,,
215,0.97,1803.935,1806.604,"Wonderful, thank you so much.",44,,
216,0.97,1806.604,1811.009,I probably don't need to start the conversation with the need for Childcare.,44,,
217,0.97,1811.009,1816.581,"However, let me just touch upon them.",44,,
218,0.97,1816.581,1824.122,"A productive parent is one that knows the child is safe, content, happy, and generally a parent wants to be close to their child.",44,,
219,0.97,1824.122,1830.562,"Have easy access just in case the child is sick, you want to be able to rush over and be able to pick up your child.",44,,
220,0.97,1830.562,1837.635,"You work for the city of Seattle, can you find Childcare within the city limits, it is a challenge.",44,,
221,0.97,1837.635,1839.237,There is a high probability that you can't.,44,,
222,0.97,1839.237,1845.076,You might need to go to the outskirts of King County to find Childcare.,44,,
223,0.97,1845.076,1858.389,This is why there are lots of challenges in opening up a family Childcare center within the city limits.,44,,
224,0.97,1858.389,1860.858,"Lots of barriers, Affordability being number one.",44,,
225,0.97,1860.858,1870.268,A family Childcare would either approach the home or rent the home.,44,,
226,0.97,1870.268,1886.451,What would the income need to be to actually purchase a home within the city of Seattle and can you actually purchase a home with a debt income type of thing.,44,,
227,0.97,1886.451,1890.955,"Usually FCC's are Renters, land space is very expensive.",44,,
228,0.97,1890.955,1899.197,"And for a business that is not established, it would be difficult to start.",44,,
229,0.97,1899.197,1915.28,"Casey highlighted that they've been in this business for a really long time and they have supports to start, and the difficult road that he is walking just to try to get a Childcare center within the city limits.",44,,
230,0.97,1915.28,1925.757,"So to these spaces, a lot of times there are changes and modifications that have to be made.",44,,
231,0.97,1925.757,1930.061,"Licensing might have to come in, they may say there needs to be another sink.",44,,
232,0.97,1930.061,1940.838,"They may say there needs to be Toileting in the facility, so it might be a remodeling of a bathroom.",44,,
233,0.97,1940.838,1950.882,"Possibly another wall that needs to be taken down, might require different fencing to make sure the space is fully fenced.",44,,
234,0.97,1950.882,1954.352,A discrete barrier between parking in the school entrance.,44,,
235,0.97,1954.352,1958.99,The city might come in and impose other improvements as well.,44,,
236,0.97,1958.99,1964.062,"The walkways, sidewalk, parking, all of these modifications are expensive.",44,,
237,0.97,1964.062,1974.038,"And for a small business, or even a small center, $4000, $5000 expense could end their business dream.",44,,
238,0.97,1974.038,1985.516,This also happens to already established Childcare centers when they are asked by the city or licensing to make a modification.,44,,
239,0.97,1985.516,1994.192,Childcare is not a big For- profit business.,44,,
240,0.97,1994.192,1996.627,Family Childcare's are really typically just trying to stay afloat.,44,,
241,0.97,1996.627,2000.131,They just have enough money to be able to make it.,44,,
242,0.97,2000.131,2007.505,"If they are hit with a modification, many times they have to close because they don't have the means to pay.",44,,
243,0.97,2007.505,2011.642,Generally there is no other options.,44,,
244,0.97,2011.642,2021.152,"Also notes, when you are starting up the business, there is obviously lots of materials, furniture and equipment you have to purchase.",44,,
245,0.97,2021.152,2043.775,"So also if you have that little start up money and you are hit with a modification cost, you very well might not be able to go forward because that little bit of money even safer materials and furniture might be devoured by that modification.",44,,
246,0.97,2043.775,2051.382,It is also important to note that we do have a large staff community in our Seattle area and city of Seattle.,44,,
247,0.97,2051.382,2056.788,"In many will not, because of religious beliefs, take out loans.",44,,
248,0.97,2056.788,2067.598,"So we are this city that has a beautiful infrastructure, Busing, transportation, so many work and business opportunities.",44,,
249,0.97,2067.598,2071.369,But the piece that is missing is Childcare.,44,,
250,0.97,2071.369,2077.775,"Noting, too, that Childcare brings job opportunities.",44,,
251,0.97,2077.775,2088.82,"And this is the right slide, it shows the number of family Childcare's and centers within the city of Seattle compared to the outlining King County area.",44,,
252,0.97,2088.82,2102.6,"Again, many families are forced to find Childcare out say or write outside of city limits because there are more choices or slots available, on the outskirts of the city.",44,,
253,0.97,2102.6,2116.214,"One example is, if you are working in Seattle and find that you are pregnant, well you better get on that list and start looking for infant care right away.",44,,
254,0.97,2116.214,2129.126,"Because, many times there is an eight or nine month wait list before the ability to get in for Childcare.",44,,
255,0.97,2129.126,2138.769,What happens if I have a spot for me infant and I've been waiting on that waiting list for seven months and then they have to close because of cost.,44,,
256,0.97,2138.769,2141.239,Infant care is the most difficult to find.,44,,
257,0.97,2141.239,2146.577,The ratios for infant care are smaller than for an older child.,44,,
258,0.97,2146.577,2169.967,"So where a teacher in a Preschooler would be one teacher to 10, for an inference infant room it's 1 to 4. you will have higher costs to staff the infant room, high-end Securities and safety measures, regulations and there is just such a huge shortage of rooms and infant care within the city.",44,,
259,0.97,2169.967,2177.642,"We have FCC's and centers with modification or startup money, it would make a huge difference.",44,,
260,0.97,2177.642,2186.951,And that little bit might be the difference of I can't open or I need to look somewhere else.,44,,
261,0.97,2186.951,2193.524,"Sites are literally 5000 to $10,000 away from opening.",44,,
262,0.97,2193.524,2198.462,A one-time support would make a huge difference.,44,,
263,0.97,2198.462,2205.903,It really supports the infrastructure of our city and brings our children to our communities.,44,,
264,0.97,2205.903,2206.404,Any questions?,44,,
265,0.97,2206.404,2220.618,"Colleagues, any questions or Cmments on this portion of the presentation?",45,,
266,0.97,2220.618,2227.258,Fcc's family Childcare center.,46,,
267,0.97,2227.258,2227.725,Thank you.,47,,
268,0.97,2227.725,2229.961,"So if I'm reading this correctly, are these 2020 numbers?",47,,
269,0.97,2229.961,2232.029,"We just pulled these Stats, this would be 2021.",48,,
270,0.97,2232.029,2244.375,So within Seattle there is a total of 629 family Childcare in the city limits.,49,,
271,0.97,2244.375,2248.746,Correct.,50,,
272,0.97,2248.746,2259.59,And do they have a sense of how many families are in need of Childcare compared to the 629 FCC's and centers?,51,,
273,0.97,2259.59,2265.496,I do not have waiting list numbers.,52,,
274,0.97,2265.496,2276.007,"Although I know we do have them, I just don't have the numbers off the top of my head.",52,,
275,0.97,2276.007,2285.683,"Our call center is bombarded with calls, running referrals for sites within the city of Seattle.",52,,
276,0.97,2285.683,2298.696,"And of the 629 locations, do you have a sense of how many Childcare slots that represents?",53,,
277,0.97,2298.696,2307.238,I know that about 18% of the enrollment is FCC's.,54,,
278,0.97,2307.238,2316.914,"Fcc's typically are anywhere from four slots, so four children, 212, Max.",54,,
279,0.97,2316.914,2322.453,"And the centers, that varies.",54,,
280,0.97,2322.453,2338.869,I think the important NOTE is that there are twice as many FCC's in the surrounding of the city as there are actually in the city.,54,,
281,0.97,2338.869,2349.58,"Yeah, and is it your sense that the reason, because his it is quite a big disparity.",55,,
282,0.97,2349.58,2358.589,"We are talking about 629 in Seattle, and 1334 in King County.",55,,
283,0.97,2358.589,2370.0,"Do you have a sense, and this question is for any of our community panelists, do you all have a sense of what explains that Delta, that discrepancy?",55,,
284,0.97,2370.0,2375.973,"Why, is it regulatory, is it price?",55,,
285,0.97,2375.973,2377.408,It is probably a bunch of things.,55,,
286,0.97,2377.408,2397.795,"I'm just trying to get a sense of, from your all perspective, being in this space, otherwise, what may be leading to that difference.",55,,
287,0.97,2397.795,2406.637,"From what I know from providers in the city of Seattle, it is Affordability.",56,,
288,0.97,2406.637,2416.714,"They can't afford to lots of modifications that need to be made, and they can't afford to make these.",56,,
289,0.97,2416.714,2429.16,It is easier for a family Childcare to go on the outskirts or a center to go on the outskirts of Seattle because it is just easier.,56,,
290,0.97,2429.16,2431.529,There is less restrictions.,56,,
291,0.97,2431.529,2434.565,It is easier to open.,56,,
292,0.97,2434.565,2441.672,"You are talking about having to pay rent, but not being able to operate.",56,,
293,0.97,2441.672,2450.08,"Not many sites can do that, family Childcare for sure.",56,,
294,0.97,2450.08,2456.587,They may have just a few month window and then they have to be up and running right away.,56,,
295,0.97,2456.587,2462.293,So Affordability and the barriers to getting a site started would be the big things I would see.,56,,
296,0.97,2462.293,2470.301,"Colleagues, any other questions from Nicole before we shift gears hear from Kathy?",57,,
297,0.97,2470.301,2475.873,"Okay, looks like none.",57,,
298,0.97,2475.873,2480.811,"Well, thank you Nicole for that presentation.",57,,
299,0.97,2480.811,2485.316,Obviously not the best news.,57,,
300,0.97,2485.316,2495.326,I can say for myself personally that it was a real struggle to find the kind and quality Childcare I need.,57,,
301,0.97,2495.326,2499.23,I have a 16 month old.,57,,
302,0.97,2499.23,2513.611,For me and my family it was really important to find a provider that will provide a bilingual inversion in Spanish in my case.,57,,
303,0.97,2513.611,2521.085,"And when you start digging into these numbers either more, it sort of became a struggle with family preferences.",57,,
304,0.97,2521.085,2536.166,"Not just in the model, but in sort of the kind of early learning and care that is provided these numbers become VEN more challenging.",57,,
305,0.97,2536.166,2547.444,"You know, of course, living in West Seattle, that became even more complicated having to deal with the West Seattle bridge in getting where I need to go.",57,,
306,0.97,2547.444,2562.459,But I really appreciate your insight into sort of the state of what we are looking at in terms of challenges for Childcare in Seattle and beyond.,57,,
307,0.97,2562.459,2564.895,So thank you for that.,57,,
308,0.97,2564.895,2568.799,"Okay, next up is Kathy.",57,,
309,0.97,2568.799,2581.579,"Take it away, we are happy to hear your perspective, and looking forward to having you share your experiences in this space as a provider.",57,,
310,0.97,2581.579,2592.423,"I was listening to Nicole, and I have been in this business since 1996.",58,,
311,0.97,2592.423,2602.299,"I started out with centers in 2005, I opened up family home.",58,,
312,0.97,2602.299,2617.214,"I have had a lot of experience in this field, but what I'm finding out, like with the city of Seattle, a lot of the parents don't qualify because they don't live in the city of Seattle.",58,,
313,0.97,2617.214,2632.863,"A lot of families, because of the cost of living to live in the city of Seattle, gave moved to the outskirts.",58,,
314,0.97,2632.863,2644.375,So that is a lot of reasons why they can't be connected with the city of Seattle.,58,,
315,0.97,2644.375,2659.39,"Also, I was talking to some of my colleagues and I know there are a lot of, there are a few programs beginning to open up.",58,,
316,0.97,2659.39,2665.529,"If you look around the city of Seattle, they are doing a lot of construction with apartment complexes.",58,,
317,0.97,2665.529,2668.465,At the bottom level they are putting Childcare.,58,,
318,0.97,2668.465,2670.901,I know that tiny Tots is doing one like that.,58,,
319,0.97,2670.901,2679.309,"I have another colleague of mine, he is doing one in the Rainier Beach area.",58,,
320,0.97,2679.309,2694.591,"He is opening up of a new program from birth to 5. and I was trying to get information from them, what are the needs that you all have?",58,,
321,0.97,2694.591,2706.537,"You know, because I know that they are major projects and they've had to get Funders with these, to help them with these ventures they are doing.",58,,
322,0.97,2706.537,2711.442,"You know, it is the cost that they have to put together.",58,,
323,0.97,2711.442,2720.784,"He gave me an example, he has to do electrical, he has to do plumbing.",58,,
324,0.97,2720.784,2727.057,"He has to do multiple things, that is his part.",58,,
325,0.97,2727.057,2728.692,The Funder will only do so much.,58,,
326,0.97,2728.692,2746.81,"Then I was talking to another colleague of mine, and she is looking into starting a program from the ground up.",58,,
327,0.97,2747.711,2749.179,And she wants to do a E-Cap.,58,,
328,0.97,2749.179,2754.384,"But when she was telling me about a lot of the barriers, and how competitive it is for the grants.",58,,
329,0.97,2754.384,2761.391,"If you don't score a certain point here, someone can bounce you out and they get the grant.",58,,
330,0.97,2761.391,2761.825,Things like that.,58,,
331,0.97,2761.825,2774.972,So there are a lot of barriers in trying to continue programs or even trying to start new ones.,58,,
332,0.97,2774.972,2781.979,"I know, for myself, I needed to put a bathroom in my Childcare space.",58,,
333,0.97,2781.979,2787.784,"Because when I got licensed, the bathroom was up the stairway.",58,,
334,0.97,2787.784,2795.526,"And every time the kids had to go to the bathroom, we had to go up.",58,,
335,0.97,2795.526,2796.36,So I went downstairs.,58,,
336,0.97,2796.36,2798.829,That was quite costly.,58,,
337,0.97,2798.829,2814.611,"And I think that is why it a lot of things I was able to do, because my children are Grown., I am not raising my own children anymore and don't have a lot of that extra cost.",58,,
338,0.97,2814.611,2824.321,And that is why I was able to do it.,58,,
339,0.97,2824.321,2851.448,"So, a lot of the people that are trying to keep their programs going or are starting new programs, they are talking about funding and a lot of funding is inaccessible or underfunded.",58,,
340,0.97,2851.448,2852.249,"So, Yeah.",58,,
341,0.97,2852.249,2861.592,"I don't know, the pandemic really put a Whammy on us with Childcare.",58,,
342,0.97,2861.592,2873.503,"A lot of people, especially family home, a lot of people are very scared of bringing children in their home.",58,,
343,0.97,2873.503,2882.412,"And you know, even adding more staff, they are concerned with that.",58,,
344,0.97,2882.412,2890.02,"So Yeah, we've got our challenges.",58,,
345,0.97,2890.02,2903.0,"In some situations, you know, we just have to believe and go forward, that everything is going to be all right.",58,,
346,0.97,2903.0,2910.007,"Thank you Kathy, so much, for sharing that perspective with us.",59,,
347,0.97,2910.007,2912.242,I see that Councilmember Strauss has his hand up.,59,,
348,0.97,2912.242,2914.945,I will hand it over to him.,59,,
349,0.97,2914.945,2923.153,"Thank you Nicole and Kathy, thank you both.",60,,
350,0.97,2923.153,2926.456,Same offer I gave to Casey goes for you as well.,60,,
351,0.97,2926.456,2938.435,"I know you are in good hands with the Council President, she can move mountains for you, and if there is anything my office can do as well, don't hesitate to reach out.",60,,
352,0.97,2938.435,2947.277,"We have so many vacant storefronts in our city, especially in new construction.",60,,
353,0.97,2947.277,2967.664,"I think of that building on crown hill in my district, since it was constructed, this cost has prohibited them from entering into those spaces and those leases.",60,,
354,0.97,2967.664,2976.106,"For you, it is even more intensive because of the different requirements that are specifically required for Childcare.",60,,
355,0.97,2976.106,2980.577,Whether it's Pull-Up or drop off space.,60,,
356,0.97,2980.577,2989.987,"The bathroom situation you just discussed, and we are doing as much as we can to support you.",60,,
357,0.97,2989.987,2995.692,"So whatever it is, please let me know.",60,,
358,0.97,2995.692,2997.361,I really appreciate being present for this presentation.,60,,
359,0.97,2997.361,3001.365,Any other questions or comments?,61,,
360,0.97,3001.365,3005.502,I will just echo Councilmember Strauss.,62,,
361,0.97,3005.502,3020.15,"For Kathy and Nicole, and thank you Casey, for your initial response to the questions I asked.",62,,
362,0.97,3020.15,3022.886,Thank you Council president and her team for setting up this discussion today.,62,,
363,0.97,3022.886,3026.957,"I know, like many of you, we have been in conversations with folks across the city during the pandemic.",62,,
364,0.97,3026.957,3033.83,That includes small business owners as well is Childcare providers.,62,,
365,0.97,3033.83,3042.339,"As was his head, even for those running it as a business, recognizing there is not a lot of profit margin there.",62,,
366,0.97,3042.339,3053.283,We need Childcare in our city so there are fewer workers that will worry about whether or not they will get home in time for Childcare providers to leave on time.,62,,
367,0.97,3053.283,3060.791,And we know from this perspective that it's also more attractive for workers if Childcare is close by.,62,,
368,0.97,3060.791,3063.66,This is an economic stimulant we need to be looking at.,62,,
369,0.97,3063.66,3071.868,I really appreciate all of your comments today.,62,,
370,0.97,3071.868,3081.411,"As Childcare organizations, you have really underscored today, the importance of us looking into every resource available.",62,,
371,0.97,3081.411,3089.219,We know there was additional assistance provided at the state level.,62,,
372,0.97,3089.219,3095.725,"That, plus County and city dollars, this is the most important thing for us to be investing in.",62,,
373,0.97,3095.725,3098.228,"And as you have all talked about, making sure the infrastructure is there.",62,,
374,0.97,3098.228,3132.629,"And I will be looking forward to continuing to you work with you, to look into ways we can address of the need for more sites, in terms of capital investments, as well as taking sure we are providing investments in providers and small business owners so people stay in his career and want to stay in this career as a profession.",62,,
375,0.97,3132.629,3144.841,"So I wanted to thank you for all of the solutions, I think that this really reflects that we have to be paramount in this discussion.",62,,
376,0.97,3144.841,3157.487,And also recognize the incredible work that the folks in this industry have done while many people have been able to stay home.,62,,
377,0.97,3157.487,3166.363,"While many Childcare facilities were shut down at this time, the top of the compounding Childcare desert.",62,,
378,0.97,3166.363,3178.408,"It means we have to come back with full force and Recommit to ways to partner with all of you, Recommit to Partnering with our Childcare community to find solutions to get out of this crisis and more equitable ways.",62,,
379,0.97,3178.408,3183.013,I just want to say thank you.,62,,
380,0.97,3183.013,3208.505,"I think it is important for us, when we think about infrastructure in the city, infrastructure, plumbing, things we all rely on and don't think of as infrastructure, but Childcare needs to be part of the definition of infrastructure.",63,,
381,0.97,3208.505,3224.554,It is important for us to acknowledge that it is important to support the wages of our providers.,63,,
382,0.97,3224.554,3232.362,The tuition cost for families on that end.,63,,
383,0.97,3232.362,3248.778,"It's important to knowledge that all the programs, services, is only as good is only as good as being able to provide the services in a care model.",63,,
384,0.97,3248.778,3282.846,"So I'm really excited about the opportunity to share this information with our other colleagues as we continue to consider how to Prioritize the one-time Federal dollars to address the realities of the Childcare needs, so thank you all for being with us and for giving us the benefit of your wisdom and expertise in this area.",63,,
385,0.97,3282.846,3297.527,"It goes a long way towards, it is being able to craft good policy and make tough budget decisions.",63,,
386,0.97,3297.527,3302.332,This affects every family in Council district across the city.,63,,
387,0.97,3302.332,3306.603,I know it is something that every Councilmember really cares about.,63,,
388,0.97,3306.603,3317.947,So I really appreciate you being with us and taking time out of your busy days to be with us today.,63,,

403,0.97,3394.391,3405.135,"Let's start with introductions, Brian, why don't you introduce yourself for the record.",63,,
404,0.97,3405.135,3411.441,"Thank you very much, Brian good night, council staff.",64,,

410,0.97,3447.677,3449.479,Would you like to introduce yourself?,68,,
411,0.97,3449.479,3454.25,"Hi, I'm the director of early learning for deal.",69,,

425,0.97,3514.944,3528.558,"Good afternoon, on the senior community development specialist with the Seattle human services Department, lead staff for the community facilities program and Childcare bonus program.",77,,
426,0.97,3528.558,3533.563,"Wonderful, thank you for being with us.",78,,
427,0.97,3533.563,3538.268,"Okay, so Cameron, I think you are first up, take it away.",78,,
428,0.97,3538.268,3546.676,"Okay, so I'm just going to have a quick slide.",79,,
429,0.97,3546.676,3557.353,"I just want to highlight this at the top, 2021, the new number of legislative proposals, and facility development, more specifically.",79,,
430,0.97,3557.353,3570.333,"I will cover this more in the next agenda item, but for conducts in the facility side, the American jobs plan has proposed 25 million for Childcare facilities.",79,,
431,0.97,3570.333,3574.804,Obviously that is just in the proposal right now.,79,,
432,0.97,3574.804,3582.445,"I think, excitedly, the state passed a budget of a total of $55 million to Re-Capitalize.",79,,
433,0.97,3582.445,3590.92,"And then at the county level, the renewal has some capital funds propose, not just for Childcare but youth spaces.",79,,
434,0.97,3590.92,3603.433,In the Puget sound funds are slated to open this year and they will have about $5 Million- $7 million available annually.,79,,
435,0.97,3603.433,3615.845,I just wanted to quickly highlight that there is a lot going on in the space from the funding side perspective.,79,,
436,0.97,3615.845,3616.279,Thank you.,79,,
437,0.97,3616.279,3625.655,"So the Department of education early learning, we began finding Childcare facilities as part of the original Seattle preschool program levy passed in 2014.",79,,
438,0.97,3625.655,3635.198,"We continue to this program, and invest the funds in three ways.",79,,
439,0.97,3635.198,3638.468,We are exclusive limited to investing in only preschool spaces.,79,,
440,0.97,3638.468,3643.573,It is all tied to participation in the Seattle preschool program.,79,,
441,0.97,3643.573,3654.951,"The first we do it is a through an annual provider, it's the Pathway providers where they are able to apply to either expand or improve their spaces.",79,,
442,0.97,3654.951,3660.957,And they can apply for up to $1 million.,79,,
443,0.97,3660.957,3662.325,We also have smaller grants available.,79,,
444,0.97,3662.325,3667.096,This is also something we started with the initial levy.,79,,
445,0.97,3667.096,3668.398,A Predevelopment specialist program.,79,,
446,0.97,3668.398,3677.807,"This is for applying for funds and also evaluating spaces for feasibility, understanding the land code and licensing.",79,,
447,0.97,3677.807,3694.724,"We developed a program where we have a number of architects who have skills, specifically in Childcare development, and we lend them out to our providers who are exploring different facility projects.",79,,
448,0.97,3694.724,3697.894,It was a program we had to pause last year but are looking to restart.,79,,
449,0.97,3697.894,3702.632,"We also make investments directly with development partners, more specifically with Seattle parks and recreation.",79,,
450,0.97,3702.632,3713.042,So we have this facility funds to essentially develop licensed community centers.,79,,
451,0.97,3713.042,3715.978,There are 10 right now and I think there are two more in line.,79,,
452,0.97,3715.978,3727.256,We have also had one experience with housing provider to Redevelop fire station 39.,79,,
453,0.97,3727.256,3730.827,So that is our brief summary.,79,,
454,0.97,3730.827,3738.167,And I will share a few challenges and opportunities.,79,,
455,0.97,3738.167,3746.776,So we NOTE some of these challenges from a facility in New York.,79,,
456,0.97,3746.776,3748.144,We certainly value the full spectrum Childcare.,79,,
457,0.97,3748.144,3762.358,It is limiting for us to only fund Pre-K. our preference are really our projects and we see more and more of our projects being more of a birth to 5 or birth to 12 focus.,79,,
458,0.97,3762.358,3764.393,Writers are not developers.,79,,
459,0.97,3764.393,3768.498,That is not there core competency.,79,,
460,0.97,3768.498,3777.974,So the challenge is to complete a nonprofit housing projects.,79,,
461,0.97,3777.974,3781.911,We really rely on them to develop themselves.,79,,
462,0.97,3781.911,3794.791,"Renovations, as we also saw, could be really costly and sometimes impossible insights that are not initially designed for this use.",79,,
463,0.97,3794.791,3806.903,"So as providers go in to try to change the use of a commercial space, they run into a number of issues that was underscored in our previous resin Tatian.",79,,
464,0.97,3806.903,3812.241,"And Lastly, this is an equity issue for us, bigger provider have advantages in Accessing funds.",79,,
465,0.97,3812.241,3818.815,It was something we tried to negate but is definitely a challenge we face.,79,,
466,0.97,3818.815,3827.023,"On the opportunity side, there are some exciting opportunities.",79,,
467,0.97,3827.023,3829.859,We see a window of opportunity that could make a big impact on this area.,79,,
468,0.97,3829.859,3837.667,"When we started our work with deal, we were the only facility funding program in the state.",79,,
469,0.97,3837.667,3841.838,Now the state has joined us and the county is about to join us as well.,79,,
470,0.97,3841.838,3849.445,So we have this grand investment to capital work that has an opportunity to make a big impact over the next several years.,79,,
471,0.97,3849.445,3862.358,Secondly we see an opportunity to really find ways to collaborate aligned with funding policies and provide access and support.,79,,
472,0.97,3862.358,3871.767,"We also need to think about how we are supporting the field around infrastructure, aligning our standards, and there is a lot of work to be done there.",79,,
473,0.97,3871.767,3878.107,"So I will conclude, I don't know if I should pass it over or suffer questions.",79,,
474,0.97,3878.107,3888.985,"Why don't we take a quick little pause for questions, sort of scanned the room to see if anyone has any questions.",80,,
475,0.97,3888.985,3895.191,"Collects, and he questions or comments on this slide?",80,,
476,0.97,3895.191,3896.192,Thank you for Pausing.,81,,
477,0.97,3896.192,3906.936,Would it be possible to ask a quick follow-up on slide five?,81,,
478,0.97,3906.936,3914.911,"Under challenges, I wanted to maybe just double check.",81,,
479,0.97,3914.911,3917.079,I may be looking at the wrong slide.,81,,
480,0.97,3917.079,3925.955,"Regarding the restrictions on deal, they are around levy fund dollars, is that correct?",81,,
481,0.97,3925.955,3928.024,That is correct.,82,,
482,0.97,3928.024,3935.231,They are intended to support the expansion of the Seattle preschool program.,82,,
483,0.97,3935.231,3943.439,So the provide service commitments to the program and we have to isolate those funds for preschool associate spaces.,82,,
484,0.97,3943.439,3949.011,So it is a levy restriction.,82,,
485,0.97,3949.011,3963.96,"It was important for us in that levy development, which was exclusively focused in terms of those capital dollars, for preschool facilities.",83,,
486,0.97,3963.96,3971.5,There is resources as identified here for addressing the need for preschool facilities infrastructure.,83,,
487,0.97,3971.5,3979.809,"But Unfortunately it is limited to the Spp program, in particular.",83,,
488,0.97,3979.809,3993.222,"Cameron, can you remind us when the levy will be up for potential renewal and reconsideration?",83,,
489,0.97,3993.222,4001.63,It goes through 2026.,84,,
490,0.97,4001.63,4003.899,"Okay, 2026, I'm sorry.",85,,
491,0.97,4003.899,4013.442,"Great, any other comments or questions on this portion of the presentation?",86,,
492,0.97,4013.442,4017.046,We will have an opportunity to spend a little more time with Deel in the next presentation.,86,,
493,0.97,4017.046,4022.618,So no worries if there are not any additional questions here.,86,,
494,0.97,4022.618,4025.321,I'm not seeing any hands raised.,86,,
495,0.97,4025.321,4027.356,Thanks Cameron for giving us a high level they are.,86,,
496,0.97,4027.356,4031.26,We will shift over to Hs the.,86,,
497,0.97,4031.26,4036.832,Good afternoon.,87,,
498,0.97,4036.832,4046.542,"I will give kind of up brief overview, similar to what Pam gave, actually we have a fair amount of overlap.",87,,
499,0.97,4046.542,4054.817,So I will try to move fairly swiftly so there is time for questions.,87,,
500,0.97,4054.817,4065.895,"For those of you that are not familiar, the community facilities program for the human services Department has traditionally been the city's response to dealing with capital needs for social service providers.",87,,
501,0.97,4065.895,4072.601,The program has the community facilities program.,87,,
502,0.97,4072.601,4082.411,"Back in 2000 for the Childcare bonus program, which was also at that point assigned to Hsd.",87,,
503,0.97,4082.411,4090.386,And came and lived within the community facilities program since they are both capital funding.,87,,
504,0.97,4090.386,4099.895,We will really focus primarily on Childcare bonus but I wanted to put that in the context of the larger umbrella.,87,,
505,0.97,4099.895,4108.17,"The Childcare program is fairly specific, it is in the land use code, it is a voluntary program.",87,,
506,0.97,4108.17,4109.538,Developers can contribute to the bonus program.,87,,
507,0.97,4109.538,4113.242,"When it was revised around 2000, it was tied with the housing bonus program.",87,,
508,0.97,4113.242,4124.987,Those who opted for additional flooring made one single dollar Contributon to the city that was split between two departments.,87,,
509,0.97,4124.987,4129.158,They have revised part of their bonus and now the Childcare bonus sits on its own.,87,,
510,0.97,4129.158,4149.378,"At a very high level, the program requires that 20% of the kids served in a facility is funded with bonus dollars is low income, the provider and Landowner commit to a 20 year obligation to provide those services.",87,,
511,0.97,4149.378,4157.253,And the city does require a Covenant to secure that performance on the land.,87,,
512,0.97,4157.253,4168.364,"Unlike the Spp program, Childcare covers the full Spetrum of Childcare through Pre-K. so we do reach the whole broad spectrum there.",87,,
513,0.97,4168.364,4173.068,The program is very interdepartmental.,87,,
514,0.97,4173.068,4176.906,A large amount of what I do involves working with our partners.,87,,
515,0.97,4176.906,4185.481,"Especially the office of housing, where we have done a lot of work particularly in the land and hope initiative.",87,,
516,0.97,4185.481,4201.43,"Bradley and his staff work with us on early leads of when projects are coming in, also for developers who choose to do a performance option in the program rather than contribute, where they build Childcare rather than contribute dollars.",87,,
517,0.97,4201.43,4210.506,"We work very extensively in Deel, and we work very key in helping Deel get established.",87,,
518,0.97,4210.506,4217.646,We have a very tight working relationship with Cameron and his colleague . and we do a little bit of work with LP CD.,87,,
519,0.97,4217.646,4227.69,"And then last but not least, we work very extensively with the law Department for all of our contracting.",87,,
520,0.97,4227.69,4233.362,"Without them, life would be very difficult.",87,,
521,0.97,4233.362,4247.776,"Program priorities, in addition to what I mentioned above, 20% low to moderate income, new spaces, I will make a note of that, the bonus program in Lnu's requirement requires this to be new spaces to expand our capacity.",87,,
522,0.97,4247.776,4256.552,That is part of the requirement under the code and the state.,87,,
523,0.97,4256.552,4263.692,"Typical things we kind of Prioritized over the years, alignment with home and hope has been a very big driver.",87,,
524,0.97,4263.692,4278.707,We were actually kind of the predecessor to the home and hope initiative to the enterprise partners.,87,,
525,0.97,4278.707,4291.42,"We have traditionally focused on serving Underserved communities and providers, people who we have kind of worked with through Hsd and Deel in the past.",87,,
526,0.97,4291.42,4293.956,Those who kind of fall under the city policies and priorities.,87,,
527,0.97,4293.956,4304.333,"Another big principal, we have been looking at transit oriented developments, like light rail stations.",87,,
528,0.97,4304.333,4319.748,"Under the projects that we have, I would say, probably four or five of them are located directly on or within a block of a light rail station.",87,,
529,0.97,4319.748,4325.721,"We have been very fortunate on that, but that was a goal initially back then.",87,,
530,0.97,4325.721,4332.528,They were very much kind of sought after when the light rail was first opening.,87,,
531,0.97,4332.528,4340.669,"And we've been very fortunate that with home and hope, we've been able to provide that.",87,,
532,0.97,4340.669,4346.341,"It gives families the chance to have access to Childcare on the way to work, or on the way home.",87,,
533,0.97,4346.341,4347.576,So that has been another priority.,87,,
534,0.97,4347.576,4355.284,"And with program accomplishments, our first dissenter that opened, opened in 2010.",87,,
535,0.97,4355.284,4365.594,"We have 12 centers, six are currently open, two are under construction, two are in negotiation and two have just been awarded funding letters.",87,,
536,0.97,4365.594,4373.869,So we believe we have funding at this time left in the program for when were center within the program.,87,,
537,0.97,4373.869,4380.075,So we can talk a little bit about that and the challenges as we flipped to the next screen.,87,,
538,0.97,4380.075,4405.2,"So challenges, the Childcare bonus revenue is somewhat unpredictable since it is tied to development mostly downtown, and with the changes in the District zoning, as development declines or as developers opt not to develop extra floor area, revenue drops.",87,,
539,0.97,4405.2,4418.046,So we ran through the development boom very well but appears to be somewhat declining at this point.,87,,
540,0.97,4418.046,4429.057,"I can't say for certain where the next few years allies, but we have been assuming that it will not resume to the level we have had, although it is possible.",87,,
541,0.97,4429.057,4436.064,"Really, the restriction that has been already mostly addressed in the program, was something we took care of years ago.",87,,
542,0.97,4436.064,4445.04,"Again, the nature of serving new, expanded slots does restrict us in some ways because of the land.",87,,
543,0.97,4445.04,4451.48,But that ties into the next point which is among the key that I wanted to bring home as well.,87,,
544,0.97,4451.48,4452.848,Which is the cost of development.,87,,
545,0.97,4452.848,4466.862,"In doing a lot of these Mixed- use centers, we are finding that costs are ranging from $3 Million- $6 million.",87,,
546,0.97,4466.862,4468.03,Those around transit oriented development.,87,,
547,0.97,4468.03,4482.911,"Some of that is probably driven by prevailing wage requirements, some is driven by land requirements read Psalm is driven by the market right now.",87,,
548,0.97,4482.911,4486.415,"The point, again, being the cost of centers.",87,,
549,0.97,4486.415,4497.092,"A gentleman mentioned that his site was a $2 million Rehab, and that is not uncommon.",87,,
550,0.97,4497.092,4508.136,"Licensing requirements, space requirements, outdoor play requirements, all contribute to a fairly expensive project.",87,,
551,0.97,4508.136,4513.742,"And the challenge also is, the debt.",87,,
552,0.97,4513.742,4515.744,A lot of providers are not able to take on debt.,87,,
553,0.97,4515.744,4524.553,That if they are it seems to run counter to the idea of making Childcare affordable and living wages for staff.,87,,
554,0.97,4524.553,4530.759,So public investment is critical for large expansion in the system.,87,,
555,0.97,4530.759,4538.367,"Last, I would say, in the challenges, it is a long lead time.",87,,
556,0.97,4538.367,4548.176,"We need a long runway and the opportunities have come up, particularly for the Mixed-Use Developmnt projects.",87,,
557,0.97,4548.176,4552.147,It could be three years for my initial conversation until the project is under possible construction or completed.,87,,
558,0.97,4552.147,4556.485,And there are limited opportunities.,87,,
559,0.97,4556.485,4565.494,"If we are unable to commit early to a project, the opportunity goes away because the developer will Repurpose the space.",87,,
560,0.97,4565.494,4571.8,"In order to close on all financing, all spaces have to be accounted for, and all financing.",87,,
561,0.97,4571.8,4575.971,"So you can't really come in after the fact, easily.",87,,
562,0.97,4575.971,4580.709,It is possible but mostly unsuccessful.,87,,
563,0.97,4580.709,4582.811,We need to have money in hand to make those commitments.,87,,
564,0.97,4582.811,4588.917,We can't actually offer and work with agencies if we don't have funds to actually be able to commit.,87,,
565,0.97,4588.917,4595.924,"So there is a long runway, not unlike low income housing.",87,,
566,0.97,4595.924,4597.926,So it is important to keep that in mind.,87,,
567,0.97,4597.926,4604.733,"From the time we start until the time we finish, three years is probably average, maybe even a minimum.",87,,
568,0.97,4604.733,4611.74,"Let's see, opportunities, the fun part.",87,,
569,0.97,4611.74,4620.148,"We have a pipeline of agencies, we share it with Deel and with our providers in state that it will talk about it a little bit.",87,,
570,0.97,4620.148,4635.263,"I would say right now we have as many as 15 of those, and I will just mention a couple near the top of the list, the University of Washington is Redeveloping their site near the light rail station.",87,,
571,0.97,4635.263,4652.681,"We have a Childcare provider in the arts space building that is of bilingual Vietnamese Childcare provider, originally partnered with the enemies partnership Association.",87,,
572,0.97,4652.681,4659.488,They are looking to do a large project.,87,,
573,0.97,4659.488,4667.796,"Bridge housing I believe may have been selected, and they are very excited about wanting to put in a center.",87,,
574,0.97,4667.796,4671.199,They have been on and off discussions with us for a number of years about that.,87,,
575,0.97,4671.199,4686.248,"I have all longer list but I will mention of Filipino community looking to acquire an adjacent site, specifically to do Childcare as part of their Filipino community village development.",87,,
576,0.97,4686.248,4688.316,"So, there are more behind them.",87,,
577,0.97,4688.316,4696.291,We mostly do focus on Center- based given the nature of funds and the complexity of the requirements.,87,,
578,0.97,4696.291,4702.13,"But, we do have a list of people, and there are other projects as well.",87,,
579,0.97,4702.13,4710.639,"Let me see, what else.",87,,
580,0.97,4710.639,4713.542,"Pre-Development, I was a camera and stole my thunder, but that is good.",87,,
581,0.97,4713.542,4714.342,Great minds think alike.,87,,
582,0.97,4714.342,4717.646,It is something that originated in the community facilities program back in the 70s.,87,,
583,0.97,4717.646,4728.523,They partnered with environment to works to do a lot of development planning and it has proved to be some of the best investment money we can do.,87,,
584,0.97,4728.523,4738.967,It guarantees successful projects and helps those who are lacking in capacity the ability to pause and figure out what is actually needed to be successful in completing a project.,87,,
585,0.97,4738.967,4748.777,Because what people sometimes think and what is actually necessary to get through the project are not the same.,87,,
586,0.97,4748.777,4755.117,I have found for my work historically that Pre- development is a very good investment and is a very good investment in working with agencies that have limited capacities.,87,,
587,0.97,4755.117,4757.486,Not every agency has the ability to go out and hire people.,87,,
588,0.97,4757.486,4763.592,Most agency developers are not developers by nature.,87,,
589,0.97,4763.592,4766.294,So anything we can do to enhance that capacity is a good thing.,87,,
590,0.97,4766.294,4776.104,"Last I would say, as it Cameron also alluded to, systemwide collaboration.",87,,
591,0.97,4776.104,4778.707,The Childcare bonus program has been active since around 2004.,87,,
592,0.97,4778.707,4784.98,"Although in prior, it goes back to 1980.",87,,
593,0.97,4784.98,4789.017,It has been great to have Deel as a partner.,87,,
594,0.97,4789.017,4804.199,"We are now working with partners at the state, the county, and partners like W CRA are now engaged.",87,,
595,0.97,4804.199,4811.406,We all are looking to meet quarterly.,87,,
596,0.97,4811.406,4815.11,Eventually I think we would like to see what we can do to make the application process easier.,87,,
597,0.97,4815.11,4831.56,"The main thing is that there is an expectation and a role that the city will be there because of representing both what is happening within our jurisdiction, as a Funder, and what we are learning and what we can help to do to build a larger network.",87,,
598,0.97,4831.56,4845.473,"I think, again, Cameron stole my other thunder, I would say we are not unlike the low income housing community and what it was like 30 something years ago.",87,,
599,0.97,4845.473,4848.376,I don't think the models will be quite as large because needs are different.,87,,
600,0.97,4848.376,4857.085,But the need to develop that capacity is there for the short term and will probably continue at some point in the Longer- term.,87,,
601,0.97,4857.085,4861.957,I don't know if we will eventually get over the Hump and get enough centers out there to meet the current demands.,87,,
602,0.97,4861.957,4868.863,But forthe foreseeable future I think we have enough work cut out for us.,87,,
603,0.97,4868.863,4871.499,With that I will stop so we can have time for questions.,87,,
604,0.97,4871.499,4875.203,Anyone else from Hsd want to add anything?,88,,
605,0.97,4875.203,4878.707,"No, that is great, thank you.",89,,
606,0.97,4878.707,4884.212,Thanks so much.,90,,
607,0.97,4884.212,4895.023,"And then, the CCB Fund, that is specifically for Center-Based care?",90,,
608,0.97,4895.023,4896.224,"Pretty much, yes, it is.",91,,
609,0.97,4896.224,4907.335,If we were to get another source of funds we can certainly look into doing home FCC or hybrid models coming up here or there.,91,,
610,0.97,4907.335,4908.87,But right now we are primarily limited.,91,,
611,0.97,4908.87,4919.781,"The 20 year requirement, slots and investment, just the overhead, it is difficult even for a lot of Center-Based providers.",91,,
612,0.97,4919.781,4926.021,We really focused on where we could be most successful in be the most Impactful with this money.,91,,
613,0.97,4926.021,4931.926,And you mentioned that the revenue is unpredictable.,92,,
614,0.97,4931.926,4942.57,"And you might have said this and I might have missed it, what is the specific revenue source?",92,,
615,0.97,4942.57,4943.872,Developer mitigation contributions.,93,,
616,0.97,4943.872,4950.745,"So when a developer wants additional floor area, if they have the option of buying more floor area by making a contribution to the bonus program.",93,,
617,0.97,4950.745,4958.386,And I think Bradley could talk a little more about some of those.,93,,
618,0.97,4958.386,4960.956,"But traditionally when it was bundled with housing, we did really well.",93,,
619,0.97,4960.956,4967.028,We came Uncoupled from housing a few years ago with changes in the code.,93,,
620,0.97,4967.028,4973.601,"I would say our repeal is, well, it is not as strong as it was, let's just say that.",93,,
621,0.97,4973.601,4983.812,And did it become Uncoupled in the context of Amendatory housing privilege?,94,,
622,0.97,4983.812,4984.612,"Yes, it has.",95,,
623,0.97,4984.612,4986.514,"I missed that, I wish I hadn't.",96,,
624,0.97,4986.514,4996.658,"Okay, colleagues, or any other questions or comments on this particular portion of the presentation?",96,,
625,0.97,4996.658,5003.631,"I'm just scanning the zoom room here, as they say.",96,,
626,0.97,5003.631,5007.635,Not seeing any hands raised on this portion.,96,,
627,0.97,5007.635,5011.139,"Thanks Ken, I really appreciate it.",96,,
628,0.97,5011.139,5023.051,So let's shift gears over to Sdci.,96,,
629,0.97,5023.051,5033.528,"Hello, I will talk about over the last year or so with E land use code changes and then challenges and opportunities going forward.",97,,
630,0.97,5033.528,5038.266,So if we could move to the first slide.,97,,
631,0.97,5038.266,5058.887,"So, the Childcare for all legislation passed last year, sponsored by Councilmember Strauss, and it was a really good effort to look at what are the impediments and barriers we have toward permitting Childcare use in the land use code.",97,,
632,0.97,5058.887,5067.162,And to move them or reduce them as much as possible.,97,,
633,0.97,5067.162,5078.473,"As Councilmember Strauss alluded to earlier, one of the changes, to make Childcare use permitted upright in war zones, rather than being conditional use permit.",97,,
634,0.97,5078.473,5101.429,"So the conditional use permit gave a really close look at impacts of Childcare on surroundings, particularly in lower density zones like Single- family or multifamily zones.",97,,
635,0.97,5101.429,5116.611,"So just by allowing the use to be permitted out right, in many cases it leads to a simple building permit review.",97,,
636,0.97,5116.611,5120.782,Secondly we deleted a dispersion distance of 600 feet.,97,,
637,0.97,5120.782,5129.858,Childcare uses are classified as institutions.,97,,
638,0.97,5129.858,5135.296,And the code did have a strong protection against having too many institutions close to one another.,97,,
639,0.97,5135.296,5142.67,We were able to take Childcare out of that dispersion requirement in the lower density Single- Family/Multifamily zones.,97,,
640,0.97,5142.67,5164.993,That enables more homes to be eligible to possibly host Childcare use rather than being sort of artificially barred from having that use because of a proximity to another institution.,97,,
641,0.97,5164.993,5178.306,"Grow several zones including commercial and Seattle multi- mixed zones, we removed Childcare from the floor area limits in the zoning.",97,,
642,0.97,5178.306,5190.485,"Which means that use can be added and built into the building without having it consumed, the permitted space that can be permitted in that building.",97,,
643,0.97,5190.485,5196.524,In effect it gives the best chance for Childcare to be added to buildings in the future.,97,,
644,0.97,5196.524,5203.765,Without it being a burden on what you can build into the building.,97,,
645,0.97,5203.765,5221.149,"A few other barriers of work removed, a size limit on Childcare and that and see one and letter and see two zones.",97,,
646,0.97,5221.149,5232.66,"And so there was 10,020 5000 square-foot limit on those but we removed that barrier.",97,,
647,0.97,5232.66,5251.412,"At the more single family residential lot level, we allowed Childcare used to be located within structures and we removed a student limit on Home-Based Childcare of 12 students.",97,,
648,0.97,5251.412,5256.484,So that was written into our code.,97,,
649,0.97,5256.484,5257.585,Reflecting estate and law limit.,97,,
650,0.97,5257.585,5272.7,"The state law limit remains, but if it is ever changed, we don't have this artificial limit on the number of students that can be served in Home- based Childcare.",97,,
651,0.97,5272.7,5283.211,"There are a few other changes as well, but we can perhaps get into those questions if you have them.",97,,
652,0.97,5283.211,5285.513,Next slide.,97,,
653,0.97,5285.513,5303.698,"Going forward, some of the challenges we have made still relate to how the public may react to a new Childcare use will go into particularly lower density neighborhoods.",97,,
654,0.97,5303.698,5311.339,They may still have concern about noise from next-door or traffic.,97,,
655,0.97,5311.339,5333.795,"Secondly, we still have minimum parking requirements in a number of residential zones for Childcare, and I can certainly provide a physical limitation if there are just limited spaces where a parking area can be put conveniently.",97,,
656,0.97,5333.795,5347.975,"I also did mentioned before, we have removed sort of a setback from a play area to an adjacent single-family zone.",97,,
657,0.97,5347.975,5356.284,Hopefully that helps play areas be located within more properties and accommodate the use.,97,,
658,0.97,5356.284,5359.787,But that could still be an issue.,97,,
659,0.97,5359.787,5367.095,In the state law still has a limit on Home-Based Childcare.,97,,
660,0.97,5367.095,5388.583,"So some of the opportunities going forward, the legislation Childcare for all really has removed a lot of these barriers that sort of work really true impediments as the main uses of properties.",97,,
661,0.97,5388.583,5393.988,"And with that use permanent out right, we see an easier and faster permitting path.",97,,
662,0.97,5393.988,5404.599,"And this should allow for more Childcare to be located closer to neighborhoods, be more convenient.",97,,
663,0.97,5404.599,5418.412,"More fitting in with people's daily needs and capabilities to drop off and pick up their children, et cetera.",97,,
664,0.97,5418.412,5423.351,"So, pausing there for questions on those topics.",97,,
665,0.97,5423.351,5430.758,Any questions or comments?,98,,
666,0.97,5430.758,5435.863,I just have to thank you for all of your help with Childcare near you.,99,,
667,0.97,5435.863,5441.169,We know we need more Childcare opportunities where people live.,99,,
668,0.97,5441.169,5452.68,"Because we've heard so many times that people have to travel outside of the city, adding traffic, pollution and time to their day.",99,,
669,0.97,5452.68,5456.784,That is time spent away from their families.,99,,
670,0.97,5456.784,5468.696,"I am a product of a Home-Based Childcare facility that I believe had more than 12 students in there, I'm sure times have changed.",99,,
671,0.97,5468.696,5475.47,I turned out all right.,99,,
672,0.97,5475.47,5480.775,So I guess understanding that state law would have to be changed for the 12 student permit.,99,,
673,0.97,5480.775,5492.753,"Are there additional legislative changes that we can take up about noise, traffic or parking requirements in residential zones?",99,,
674,0.97,5492.753,5501.095,I'm sure we can find a way to reduce some of the parking requirements in particular.,100,,
675,0.97,5501.095,5519.413,"I was going to say that the biggest impediment is when we do a change of use in the smaller, less dense zones, it's when they come into an existing building and wanted to turn it into a Childcare center.",101,,
676,0.97,5519.413,5523.818,One of the primary obstacles is how do they accommodate working.,101,,
677,0.97,5523.818,5524.352,And also loading areas.,101,,
678,0.97,5524.352,5529.524,That is the biggest impediment I see for a lot of the smaller ones.,101,,
679,0.97,5529.524,5539.0,"If we can go ahead and look at how we can address the parking situation, then I think we would be at an advantage.",101,,
680,0.97,5539.0,5546.774,I also want to point out and address the Predevelopment service program.,101,,
681,0.97,5546.774,5560.488,I think it provides me with an opportunity if I have a way to direct these folks coming in for the smaller projects like family care centers.,101,,
682,0.97,5560.488,5573.501,"I had a person I was talking to three years ago, she was struggling and wanted to open up a day care in the Seattle area.",101,,
683,0.97,5573.501,5579.707,"I try to explain to her, our code is not that complex, right?",101,,
684,0.97,5579.707,5622.35,"I was trying to help her, but it was a point where it came really challenging and I wanted to direct her to somebody, an organization but I didn't know about an organization to guide her to become a successful business person so I would love to team up with folks and just talk about this program and see how we can help out and make certain we provide a strong program so people can get the necessary information.",101,,
685,0.97,5622.35,5632.86,"And in doing this type of conversion, and we are just talking about conversions right now, it is challenging.",101,,
686,0.97,5632.86,5639.3,"If you are not sophisticated enough in going through the city systems, you will get lost.",101,,
687,0.97,5639.3,5647.208,"To me, we are not helping if we cannot address that crucial element of providing education to these folks can be more successful.",101,,
688,0.97,5647.208,5656.784,"I think the bigger projects, under the Childcare centers.",101,,
689,0.97,5656.784,5665.493,"When we talk about the length of time to get a permit, it is built into this Mixed-Use development.",101,,
690,0.97,5665.493,5674.702,We are talking about maybe in eight story building or taller.,101,,
691,0.97,5674.702,5676.47,So that is already built into our program.,101,,
692,0.97,5676.47,5680.207,So that is not where the flags are.,101,,
693,0.97,5680.207,5693.688,"But the city Council has helped us by taking away the Acu, but added a process that increased the time to turn these goals and aspirations to provide Childcare in neighborhoods.",101,,
694,0.97,5693.688,5699.593,So I want to thank you for that work in the last year.,101,,
695,0.97,5699.593,5701.695,It opened up a lot of doors for people.,101,,
696,0.97,5701.695,5707.635,But now we just have to get them and help them to understand how to go through the permitting process.,101,,
697,0.97,5707.635,5710.337,I cannot thank you enough.,102,,
698,0.97,5710.337,5716.444,You kind of buried the weed there and I have to highlight and lift you up a little bit.,102,,
699,0.97,5716.444,5727.855,"You are providing, technical assistance to people who want to provide Childcare.",102,,
700,0.97,5727.855,5729.457,And that technical assistance is understanding the code.,102,,
701,0.97,5729.457,5735.963,And the Land-Use chair.,102,,
702,0.97,5735.963,5740.067,And without my colleagues I would be totally lost.,102,,
703,0.97,5740.067,5750.344,"And it is not because I was in a Home-Based Childcare that had more than 12 students, I am steeped in this.",102,,
704,0.97,5750.344,5753.414,So I just have to thank you so much.,102,,
705,0.97,5753.414,5767.828,"It can be overlooked and not lifted up, and what you are doing is the critical work that so many people in our city needs.",102,,
706,0.97,5767.828,5768.796,You are doing incredible work.,102,,
707,0.97,5768.796,5769.463,Thank you.,103,,
708,0.97,5769.463,5772.166,But it's not enough.,103,,
709,0.97,5772.166,5774.235,"Excuse me, for me, it is not enough.",103,,
710,0.97,5774.235,5786.113,"My hands are tied, I need to have someplace I can go and place them too.",103,,
711,0.97,5786.113,5787.748,Can provide the kind of support they need.,103,,
712,0.97,5787.748,5789.817,I think that is a really good point.,104,,
713,0.97,5789.817,5795.689,I think this Predevelopment issue is a really common thread.,104,,
714,0.97,5795.689,5804.598,We've heard it from the community panel and every single presentation right now and Sdci is providing the!,104,,
715,0.97,5804.598,5808.502,At the end of that theory of the case here.,104,,
716,0.97,5808.502,5819.847,"That we are doing important, necessary work to make it easier to cite places or convert places.",104,,
717,0.97,5819.847,5838.065,"But where there is a significant gap is that technical assistance to provide small business owners and providers the know-how, the skill SETS they need to be able to enter into the market and navigate.",104,,
718,0.97,5838.065,5861.989,"So we have a couple of different solutions that we can set up, like an interdepartmental team to work on this issue and come back to us with some recommendations that would help identify how to remove some of those bureaucratic challenges in the areas where we can remove those bureaucratic challenges.",104,,
719,0.97,5861.989,5880.574,"Then there are opportunities for us to figure out how to Programmatically provide supports and resources to you and others that might make it sort of easier to navigate this system and the requirements that are imposed and that we can't waive, for whatever reason.",104,,
720,0.97,5880.574,5895.623,"So, I am hearing you loud and clear and I think this is an exciting opportunity for collaboration and some good outcomes and results.",104,,
721,0.97,5895.623,5904.632,So thank you for Punctuating that need for us.,104,,
722,0.97,5904.632,5910.671,"So, we were really excited when this legislation was passed.",105,,
723,0.97,5910.671,5919.346,"One thing to point out, this covered Land-Use, and is so we were exploring this as an option for some of our Seattle children's families.",105,,
724,0.97,5919.346,5928.055,"But what we ran into, that was not addressed maybe, is that there is the building code piece of it.",105,,
725,0.97,5928.055,5935.529,"So to put a Childcare center in our three zone location, you still have to have a building that has an occupancy.",105,,
726,0.97,5935.529,5952.179,"So it triggers that substantial altercation I brought up before, and we did a feasibility on a house that we could have put 20 children in and that would have caused $600,000.",105,,
727,0.97,5952.179,5956.984,"So this legislation is great for Land-Use, but it did not solve the building code piece.",105,,
728,0.97,5956.984,5959.453,So I just wanted to add that in.,105,,
729,0.97,5959.453,5959.853,Thank you.,105,,
730,0.97,5959.853,5967.294,Thank you for the clarification.,106,,
731,0.97,5967.294,5974.234,Thank you very much Council president and Hank you again to Casey for providing some real-life experience here.,107,,
732,0.97,5974.234,5991.618,"I did want a chance to ask all of the departments if they may want to directly respond to some of the concerns they heard in the previous panel including SME of the weight times, costs and delays that were identified in the slide.",107,,
733,0.97,5991.618,6006.3,"And, just while I have the Mike, I want to say that I really appreciate what others have underscored about the need for these connective issues to be made.",107,,
734,0.97,6006.3,6017.144,We have control of our parking requirements and being able to set up program so people can navigate this system.,107,,
735,0.97,6017.144,6035.162,"And I would just ask, if there is anything we can do in an expedited fashion in the emergency of Covid, like we have done with restaurants and SME of our other infrastructure in the city, this is the great equalizer to help get folks back to work.",107,,
736,0.97,6035.162,6043.47,"I'd love to see those strategies, especially around parking and helping people navigate the system be done in an emergency nature as we respond to getting people back out.",107,,
737,0.97,6043.47,6066.293,"And the last question I would have would be to as the departments, is there anything we do to help track or support entities, do we do any transition or tracking or support to ensure that successful providers have the opportunity to grow.",107,,
738,0.97,6066.293,6069.596,I know there are some shared service models with businesses that have been discussed a lot.,107,,
739,0.97,6069.596,6078.572,Have you seen conversation with folks in the business community on how to support greater equity and access through the Childcare site?,107,,
740,0.97,6078.572,6083.71,I can start on the process questions.,108,,
741,0.97,6083.71,6096.19,"And I think what Council member Strauss alluded to, thinking about the Goalsetting or priority setting.",108,,
742,0.97,6096.19,6123.717,"I think one of the things, sort of the way we set priorities on, when it comes to intake or precept meetings faster, I think that is where we would need to look to try to reduce some of those initial weight times.",108,,
743,0.97,6123.717,6129.056,"Bradley, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.",108,,
744,0.97,6129.056,6129.723,I do.,109,,
745,0.97,6129.723,6135.329,"Again, it has to do what I call our frequent flyers.",109,,
746,0.97,6135.329,6143.47,Folks that know our system and are able to come in and go out in a relatively swift period of time.,109,,
747,0.97,6143.47,6149.243,This also includes Childcare developers.,109,,
748,0.97,6149.243,6158.852,"So when I am looking at these numbers, it took 56 days for a Pre-Sub, to me that is unacceptable.",109,,
749,0.97,6158.852,6164.992,We deal with thousands of projects that come into our Department.,109,,
750,0.97,6164.992,6171.532,Maybe it was technology with some software Glitch or whatever.,109,,
751,0.97,6171.532,6172.933,But I would need to investigate that.,109,,
752,0.97,6172.933,6175.736,"But these numbers seem kind of high to me, just looking at them.",109,,
753,0.97,6175.736,6192.319,"Once we have that Pre-Sub, we typically get a sense of what we have here and then we try to sort it in a way and get the right people on their to help expedite those reviews.",109,,
754,0.97,6192.319,6209.436,"But we can go ahead and look at Prioritizing these types of projects, but I think that, for every one of these, you will find another one that just spawns cell through the system.",109,,
755,0.97,6209.436,6220.847,"With regard to design review I heard mentioned for substantial alteration, as long as the building has not changed, substantial alterations are internal to the building.",109,,
756,0.97,6220.847,6228.322,"And I might be speaking out of turn here, but I have worked on a number of these.",109,,
757,0.97,6228.322,6233.026,"What we have all the way up North, a skeleton and bones of a building that has a substantial alteration.",109,,
758,0.97,6233.026,6236.63,They might want to go ahead and put some openings or windows or whatever.,109,,
759,0.97,6236.63,6241.268,But that would not trigger a design review.,109,,
760,0.97,6241.268,6254.181,"So I am intrigued about what happened and we are looking at design review early for multi family zones and higher, in most cases.",109,,
761,0.97,6254.181,6263.557,"But it is not an issue right now, so there is nothing to speak about if it is a change of use with the existing structure.",109,,
762,0.97,6263.557,6276.67,"It is in the same category, regardless if it is 1000 square feet or 24,000 square feet.",109,,
763,0.97,6276.67,6287.881,So that would not even be in the mix for a change of use application.,109,,
764,0.97,6287.881,6296.59,"First I think all of the community panel, what we have heard really rings true.",110,,
765,0.97,6296.59,6330.557,"So just briefly, we did have an M away for Sdci to provide for family members, and we heard some good feedback on that and then really we were talking about the recent legislators, there is an opportunity to waive that limit going forward.",110,,
766,0.97,6330.557,6342.202,So that is something we will have to learn more about.,110,,
767,0.97,6343.203,6347.374,Any other questions or comments on this presentation?,111,,
768,0.97,6347.374,6354.247,"Okay, I'm not seeing any other hands raised, thanks to all of you for being with us.",111,,
769,0.97,6354.247,6359.386,"I know we went a little long, but I appreciate your Patienc.",111,,
770,0.97,6359.386,6374.067,"Lots of really rich information here for us to follow up with so again, this is just sort of creating the foundation of this conversation and I really look forward to the next steps in good follow-up.",111,,
771,0.97,6374.067,6379.272,I think it will lead to some really good results here.,111,,
772,0.97,6379.272,6386.613,For those of you who are done with that agenda item you are welcome to log off.,111,,
773,0.97,6386.613,6400.227,And we will go to our third agenda item and I will ask the clerk to read that agenda item into the record.,111,,
774,0.97,6400.227,6408.935,"Strategies for spending access to Childcare, 2019 Council budget actions for briefing and discussion.",112,,
775,0.97,6408.935,6412.606,Thank you so much.,113,,
776,0.97,6412.606,6416.81,"Okay, we are on the last agenda item, we are scheduled to talk about this for about 30 minutes.",113,,
777,0.97,6416.81,6421.047,I apologize we will go just a little over our 4:00 and time.,113,,
778,0.97,6421.047,6426.653,But this is an important report out from Deel.,113,,
779,0.97,6426.653,6434.394,So in the 2019 budget season I sponsored several Council actions.,113,,
780,0.97,6434.394,6441.101,"One is how we can, as a city, expand access to infant and toddler care.",113,,
781,0.97,6441.101,6449.643,In this this of course sort of a bridge to the Stp program.,113,,
782,0.97,6449.643,6456.616,And we ask Deel to share strategies and approaches from a global perspective.,113,,
783,0.97,6456.616,6460.153,So we can get recommendations on how to grow Childcare opportunities in the city of Seattle.,113,,
784,0.97,6460.153,6468.028,So Deel is here to provide us a report on what they learned and to share their recommendations.,113,,
785,0.97,6468.028,6474.1,So I will hand it over to director Chapelle.,113,,
786,0.97,6474.1,6475.502,Thank you.,114,,
787,0.97,6475.502,6483.944,Good afternoon Council president in all other Councilmember colleagues here this afternoon.,114,,
788,0.97,6483.944,6487.681,If we could get the first slide up I will kick us off.,114,,
789,0.97,6487.681,6489.916,"You know the team, we just did introductions a moment ago.",114,,
790,0.97,6489.916,6495.922,So I will save those.,114,,
791,0.97,6495.922,6503.396,We will Queue up the presentation in just a minute.,115,,
792,0.97,6503.396,6509.603,I just want to thank you for having the panel presentations before.,115,,
793,0.97,6509.603,6549.242,"I thought that was perfect timing, as you mentioned we will be talking about the Council sponsored research and planning that is related to an issue that is really critical in supporting our families here in Seattle today, we believe it resulted in a rich set of recommendations and how we can expand quality and affordable Childcare options.",115,,
794,0.97,6549.242,6550.844,Particularly for families that have very young children.,115,,
795,0.97,6550.844,6562.489,"So, in a few moments we will provide an overview of the process, and we will talk about some key issues in the proposed path forward.",115,,
796,0.97,6562.489,6578.772,So please know that we will keep this presentation as brief as possible so we can have some opportunity to field some questions.,115,,
797,0.97,6578.772,6579.372,Next slide please.,115,,
798,0.97,6579.372,6581.641,"So what this is, this is the agenda for the presentation.",115,,
799,0.97,6581.641,6588.615,This work took place in multiple stages and similar structure to that memo of what we are going to do.,115,,
800,0.97,6588.615,6602.362,"We will briefly summarize like the slide list, and we are going to conclude the presentation by providing a more in depth overview of the current child care policy landscape.",115,,
801,0.97,6602.362,6613.707,"As you mentioned, our values and outcomes that were lifted up and our approach to implementing and considering future recommendations.",115,,
802,0.97,6613.707,6615.442,Next slide please.,115,,
803,0.97,6615.442,6654.447,"So, what I will do, a lot of the recommendations will in cap impact the C cap program and in February we did it deep dive on the C cap, so with that in mind, I'd like to Recap a little bit of that, so the Childcare assistance program was created in the early 70s, as part of a funding initiative that was intended to eradicate poverty.",115,,
804,0.97,6654.447,6674.1,"At that time, child care subsidies were paired with provider supports from public health and then from there the program grew, it later grew with funding of support from the city's general fund.",115,,
805,0.97,6674.1,6683.243,"To increase subsidies, expand health supports and it also included a quality component of training that had professional development and technical assistance.",115,,
806,0.97,6683.243,6696.289,And today the C cap includes a little over 200 providers with about 60 family child care providers and 140 Childcare centers.,115,,
807,0.97,6696.289,6705.932,"So between it 2018 and 2020, C cap observed an average of 725 children a year.",115,,
808,0.97,6705.932,6713.94,Currently 84% of the children that are utilizing the C cap subsidies are ages 3 to 12.,115,,
809,0.97,6713.94,6723.55,"And of them, 46% of them are in preschool age and 38% of those are School-Aged children.",115,,
810,0.97,6723.55,6746.573,"84% of our families identify as by pop,, so historically infants and toddlers have made up approximately 10 to 20% of the C cap program since 2010.",115,,
811,0.97,6746.573,6758.952,"As you know, younger children are typically more expensive to serve in C cap.",115,,
812,0.97,6758.952,6764.691,And the Burke consulting group created an in-depth analysis of the C cap program back in 2018.,115,,
813,0.97,6764.691,6770.697,They really outlined concentration of eligible families within the city.,115,,
814,0.97,6770.697,6772.866,And looked at the historical service patterns for the program.,115,,
815,0.97,6772.866,6783.877,"So with that brief Recap, I will kick it over to Monica, our early learning director to carry us out from here.",115,,
816,0.97,6783.877,6787.313,"And if you can go to the next slide, please.",115,,
817,0.97,6787.313,6800.026,"How was the Council President mentioned, we received three requests from the cycle, all related to Childcare.",116,,
818,0.97,6800.026,6802.128,So it has been a busy year.,116,,
819,0.97,6802.128,6814.24,And we also have a statement of legislative intent related to labor harmony which is currently in its final stages.,116,,
820,0.97,6814.24,6830.49,"I wanted to just recognize that, despite the Covid interruptions and the long process, all of the programs have been incredibly informative and fruitful.",116,,
821,0.97,6830.49,6842.468,"So the two related CBA's that the field was a given, were interrelated.",116,,
822,0.97,6842.468,6850.076,So we are reporting out on both of them together.,116,,
823,0.97,6850.076,6851.511,They had a few distinct components.,116,,
824,0.97,6851.511,6853.98,What we did was we identified some core issues to focus on.,116,,
825,0.97,6853.98,6855.882,The first was access to infant and toddler care.,116,,
826,0.97,6855.882,6867.994,"We want to make sure we are addressing barriers related to access, identifying specific strategies we can address through our C cap model and also identifying strategies outside of our C cap focus.",116,,
827,0.97,6867.994,6873.766,Next slide please.,116,,
828,0.97,6873.766,6881.307,"Originally, we started the work in early 2020, but it was quickly halted in March due to the pandemic.",116,,
829,0.97,6881.307,6892.418,We resumed our work in July of 2020 by developing the concept of our research and contracting with our research partners.,116,,
830,0.97,6892.418,6918.578,"Then, beginning in September of 2020, that was the bulk of the work, our researchers, consultants and data election did all the research and alignment and concluded they are researching the early 2021, at which point Deel developed in internal Workgroup and started going through all of the reports and recommendations.",116,,
831,0.97,6918.578,6933.493,"And started to Prioritize them, and work shopping them internally.",116,,
832,0.97,6933.493,6937.463,"Then we started also sharing and receiving feedback, which is where we are right now, Presentig it to you all.",116,,
833,0.97,6937.463,6949.876,And then starts the fun work of actually doing some Implementations and at the end of the presentation we will talk about what we are ready to implement in 2021.,116,,
834,0.97,6949.876,6953.78,And considerations for 2022 and beyond.,116,,
835,0.97,6953.78,6955.581,Next slide please.,116,,
836,0.97,6955.581,6959.519,"So, we partnered with two main consulting groups.",116,,
837,0.97,6959.519,7000.36,"One was the education Council and we work closely with the start early based in Washington, D.C. and they are national policy and advocacy organizations that do a lot of research and have a very good overview of national policy and what is going on across the country in terms of Childcare they gave us some case studies of different jurisdictions across the country, and also did a very thorough literature review.",116,,
838,0.97,7000.36,7004.831,Then we also consulted with Dr.,116,,
839,0.97,7004.831,7016.442,"Sharon knight, here in Seattle who focused primarily on the community outreach for Ccap, providers, parents, families and Childcare providers.",116,,
840,0.97,7016.442,7024.083,So all of this information was used to inform policies and recommendations that we were discussing.,116,,
841,0.97,7024.083,7027.653,"Next slide, please.",116,,
842,0.97,7027.653,7042.101,"So as we talk more about the context for all of this, I think we have a good background based in context because of all the previous conversations, today.",116,,
843,0.97,7042.101,7050.076,"A lot of barriers were, of course, identified through all of the report.",116,,
844,0.97,7050.076,7062.288,The CBA reports highlighted a series of issues that we really need to work to resolve if we are going to develop sustainable support to strengthen and access Supportability.,116,,
845,0.97,7062.288,7068.661,"So the three buckets of barriers are around family barriers, provider barriers, and system barriers.",116,,
846,0.97,7068.661,7077.603,"And to highlight a few, I will skip all the facilities discussion.",116,,
847,0.97,7077.603,7079.806,I think we had a good background on that.,116,,
848,0.97,7079.806,7102.495,"But Obviously, access is not only where the Childcare is, but for families, it is challenging for them who have Nontraditional Workhours to find access to Childcare that can meet their needs.",116,,
849,0.97,7102.495,7104.33,The Childcare costs are prohibitive for the average family.,116,,
850,0.97,7104.33,7107.433,They pay more for infant care than they would for tuition at a public college.,116,,
851,0.97,7107.433,7109.702,So that is really one area that we are looking closely to.,116,,
852,0.97,7109.702,7120.646,Another Panelist earlier talked about the need for families to move out of city limits.,116,,
853,0.97,7120.646,7124.35,"They might still work in the city, but they can afford to live in the city anymore.",116,,
854,0.97,7124.35,7127.453,"If they don't live in the city, they are no longer eligible for the Ccap program.",116,,
855,0.97,7127.453,7128.721,So that is a big barrier.,116,,
856,0.97,7128.721,7135.461,Then we also learned that families don't know about Ccap.,116,,
857,0.97,7135.461,7137.83,So that is something we are going to be addressing as well.,116,,
858,0.97,7137.83,7151.544,"Then, from the provider,--barriers--Obviously, you know, it's a challenging business model to run Childcare, especially for infants and toddlers.",116,,
859,0.97,7151.544,7155.081,It is very difficult for Seattle service providers to sustain this.,116,,
860,0.97,7155.081,7166.158,Providers reportedly lose money serving infants and toddlers both locally and nationally.,116,,
861,0.97,7166.158,7167.326,There is an equitable workforce compensation.,116,,
862,0.97,7167.326,7170.763,"Almost half of the States Childcare workers are on government assistance, themselves.",116,,
863,0.97,7170.763,7181.073,Caregivers and teachers with a bachelor's degree earn nearly half the average of their professions with bachelors degrees.,116,,
864,0.97,7181.073,7184.81,"Then, also, we understand that we are part of a very complicated Childcare bureaucracy.",116,,
865,0.97,7184.81,7191.617,"It is a complex operating environment for providers, if they received funding from different sources.",116,,
866,0.97,7191.617,7196.989,That is also something we are trying to address with our plans.,116,,
867,0.97,7196.989,7216.742,"And finally, systemic barriers, you know, again, a lack of alignment and shared planning between city and local nonprofit, County and state, and just an example of how a lot of the facilities work is all within our cities.",116,,
868,0.97,7216.742,7222.315,It's certainly something we can improve on.,116,,
869,0.97,7222.315,7224.55,"I think, today, we underscored that.",116,,
870,0.97,7224.55,7227.753,"Next slide, please.",116,,
871,0.97,7227.753,7233.859,Kim has already given an overview of this pretty deeply in the previous presentation.,116,,
872,0.97,7233.859,7255.047,"But I wanted to just really emphasize that we have taken this work slowly, and want to make sure our decisions are good in the context of everything else that is happening right now in the country and locally.",116,,
873,0.97,7255.047,7268.427,"So, we have three Federal funding packages that include Childcare components, and the state, you know, can mention that the cure for kids act was signed into law.",116,,
874,0.97,7268.427,7276.902,That was funding to deepen working connection subsidies as well as many other components.,116,,
875,0.97,7276.902,7283.709,We have the King County best arts for kids Childcare that is being developed.,116,,
876,0.97,7283.709,7295.021,"Then I also want to recognize that back in 2020, we were to expand Ccap and received additional funding for that.",116,,
877,0.97,7295.021,7300.793,That was filed also because of Covid and lack of demand.,116,,
878,0.97,7300.793,7302.828,We are prepared to continue that in 2020 and on demand.,116,,
879,0.97,7302.828,7310.236,"So, I don't know if anybody--Duane, do you want to add anything to that?",116,,
880,0.97,7310.236,7313.539,"No Ma'am, I think you covered most of it.",117,,
881,0.97,7313.539,7336.162,"I would like to share that I am collaborating with my good colleague, Leo, over at the county, just to continue strengthening our partnership as well, just seeing if there are any areas of alignment or other strategic ways we can partner on behalf of our Seattle children and families.",117,,
882,0.97,7336.162,7338.464,I just want to share that with the group as well.,117,,
883,0.97,7338.464,7338.864,Great.,118,,
884,0.97,7338.864,7340.766,"So, we can go to the next slide.",118,,
885,0.97,7340.766,7343.769,Then I will pass it off to camp.,118,,
886,0.97,7343.769,7351.577,"Cam is the leader for the policy building, and really spearheaded this whole project.",118,,
887,0.97,7351.577,7356.649,So I would love for him to talk a little deeply about the process that he led the team through.,118,,
888,0.97,7356.649,7361.487,"Thank you, Monica and Wayne.",119,,
889,0.97,7361.487,7369.462,"So now we will shift the presentation to the affordable access to Childcare, specifically for families with young children.",119,,
890,0.97,7369.462,7379.805,"Next slide, please.",119,,
891,0.97,7380.439,7381.607,"So, the reports are pretty big.",119,,
892,0.97,7381.607,7383.809,"They have a lot of recommendations, lots of great ideas.",119,,
893,0.97,7383.809,7394.62,I think a big challenge for us O deal with is to prior and understand what was the best fit for Seattle and how we would address the issue.,119,,
894,0.97,7394.62,7397.89,"Actually, one of the conditions for ourselves was to develop the policy, direction and guiding values.",119,,
895,0.97,7397.89,7400.426,So we did that before we started to dig into the reports.,119,,
896,0.97,7400.426,7405.898,"That is on the slide, right here.",119,,
897,0.97,7405.898,7407.8,I would just kind of walk through them pretty briefly.,119,,
898,0.97,7407.8,7410.202,What we use is a lens to think through the recommendations.,119,,
899,0.97,7410.202,7414.707,"The first, we are to Prioritize dismantling racist brackets that are involved with programs that are blowing up families.",119,,
900,0.97,7414.707,7416.108,We want the Ccap is no exception.,119,,
901,0.97,7416.108,7430.122,There are policies that are overly punitive for people of color and providers that serve them.,119,,
902,0.97,7430.122,7432.625,We want to work to dismantle those as much as we can.,119,,
903,0.97,7432.625,7435.761,"Secondly, we want to focus on addressing issues that are unique for infant and toddler care.",119,,
904,0.97,7435.761,7437.73,"A lot of times, toddler care gets lumped into Childcare.",119,,
905,0.97,7437.73,7454.747,"We know the issue is economic, also, service delivery issues for toddlers, we want to make sure we are addressing those, specifically, and Lastly, we talked a lot about this, we want to make sure that recommendations in the current policy land Cape--landscape and if it families.",119,,
906,0.97,7454.747,7457.483,We are working on collaborating and building our work off of that.,119,,
907,0.97,7457.483,7461.42,"Let's go to the next slide, please.",119,,
908,0.97,7461.42,7471.297,"You know, as Monica mentioned, it is really a complex intersection of barriers.",119,,
909,0.97,7471.297,7474.8,One thing we also wanted to do was lift up what outcomes we want to influence.,119,,
910,0.97,7474.8,7480.84,"An important part of that is, we want to address this problem, Holistically.",119,,
911,0.97,7480.84,7484.076,We don't want to think about access for families and also think about the providers.,119,,
912,0.97,7484.076,7491.116,"So these are the five outcomes that we really wanted to focus on, and really brief recommendations, we make sure we have recommendations that address each of them.",119,,
913,0.97,7491.116,7497.923,The first is how to increase demand for Ccap.,119,,
914,0.97,7497.923,7498.524,Families are eligible.,119,,
915,0.97,7498.524,7499.525,We know they aren't participating.,119,,
916,0.97,7499.525,7504.063,How can they increase the ability and to give edge of the benefit?,119,,
917,0.97,7504.063,7504.597,"Secondly, Sustainability.",119,,
918,0.97,7504.597,7510.636,We hurt a lot today in the previous presentation about the care sector and the enormous pressure.,119,,
919,0.97,7510.636,7511.036,It's fragile.,119,,
920,0.97,7511.036,7520.546,"We also need to think about what our policies are doing to encourage a more sustainable business model, and also from the wage issues that have been discussed.",119,,
921,0.97,7520.546,7520.946,"Third, quality.",119,,
922,0.97,7520.946,7523.883,Quality is important for us at Deel.,119,,
923,0.97,7523.883,7525.584,We don't want low quality in Childcare.,119,,
924,0.97,7525.584,7540.866,We make sure we give out subsidies to a quality program and we are providing the support the community needs to make sure we are maintaining quality--increasing quality.,119,,
925,0.97,7540.866,7542.668,"Lastly, systemic alignment, we talked a bit about that.",119,,
926,0.97,7542.668,7551.777,"It is on us to be aligned, Systemically, making--strengthening that area.",119,,
927,0.97,7551.777,7552.211,"And Lastly, supply.",119,,
928,0.97,7552.211,7553.178,We talked about it earlier.,119,,
929,0.97,7553.178,7554.88,We need more infant and toddler slots.,119,,
930,0.97,7554.88,7556.081,We need more infants lots.,119,,
931,0.97,7556.081,7558.851,Those are the five outcomes that we centered our recommendations around.,119,,
932,0.97,7558.851,7565.09,"Let's go to the next slide, please.",119,,
933,0.97,7565.09,7568.794,So we are approaching this work in three phases.,119,,
934,0.97,7568.794,7574.733,"The first, we will talk about immediate recommendations.",119,,
935,0.97,7574.733,7586.011,-- we feel the fundamental changes that will strengthen our approach in Childcare work and fit within the current budget will allow us to expand into expansion next year.,119,,
936,0.97,7586.011,7598.757,"The second phase, we want to stay closely connected to the impacts of fair step for kids.",119,,
937,0.97,7601.393,7604.496,"The SK renewal, as early as August is over about $35 million Childcare component, annually.",119,,
938,0.97,7604.496,7607.132,"Also, we want to keep our eye on the Federal bills as well.",119,,
939,0.97,7607.132,7609.234,So we realize the second phase is doing a deep dive.,119,,
940,0.97,7609.234,7610.636,How do we build from that?,119,,
941,0.97,7610.636,7623.782,Then we want to move into a third phase which is kind of the second tranche of recommendations.,119,,
942,0.97,7623.782,7632.224,"We have a lot of things we want to try, pilot, we want to make sure we are cautious and understanding what is happening in phase two and start him on the right things in the second wave as we move forward.",119,,
943,0.97,7632.224,7637.329,"That's how we are seeing the roadmap of the next 2 to 3 years, really strengthening our work around access and Affordability for Childcare.",119,,
944,0.97,7637.329,7639.264,Now we will go over to the next slide.,119,,
945,0.97,7639.264,7642.668,And I will turn it over to Monica to talk about phase one and what we are doing.,119,,
946,0.97,7642.668,7647.806,"I think you are on mute, Monica.",119,,
947,0.97,7647.806,7663.756,"So, for this implementation, you know, to be soon, this summer, we want to start with significant Ccap modifications that we think will address issues for families and for providers.",120,,
948,0.97,7663.756,7674.5,"So, first thing, we want to expand family eligibility by expanding it to parents earning masters degrees or who are actively searching for jobs, or those unable to work due to disabilities.",120,,
949,0.97,7674.5,7683.909,Those are changes to the eligibility that I think will be beneficial to families.,120,,
950,0.97,7683.909,7687.713,"I know Council President Gonzales has been lobbying for one of those, at least, for a few years.",120,,
951,0.97,7687.713,7689.381,So I am glad to address that one.,120,,
952,0.97,7689.381,7697.723,"We also, for providers and families, we want to streamline and simplify our voucher system.",120,,
953,0.97,7697.723,7725.851,"We are making modifications to how the vouchers are issued, how long they last, you know, determination processes, simple five things and reduced barriers for families and providers, then Finally, we want to also start expanding provider eligibility currently, Ccap providers need to be within city limits.",120,,
954,0.97,7725.851,7730.756,That is limiting for families who may live on the border or me work outside the city.,120,,
955,0.97,7730.756,7752.244,"So, we are going to start Partnering with Childcare providers who live adjacent to city limits, so both, you know, Seatac, even short line, areas where there is--weather has been demand in the past.",120,,
956,0.97,7752.244,7760.486,Those are some quick recommendations we are putting into place starting this summer.,120,,
957,0.97,7760.486,7765.457,All of which can be in our current budget.,120,,
958,0.97,7765.457,7773.899,We think we will have positive impacts for families and providers as well.,120,,
959,0.97,7773.899,7782.608,"Then also, this summer, if you look at look--at the next slide, we want to start thinking about Ccap in a different light.",120,,
960,0.97,7782.608,7791.183,The first thing that we are going to start work on very soon is developing a cost of care framework.,120,,
961,0.97,7791.183,7799.792,I think one of the clear findings is that infant and toddler care is very expensive.,120,,
962,0.97,7799.792,7805.531,There is no program right now that is properly supporting providers to offer this.,120,,
963,0.97,7805.531,7819.344,"So, our subsidy doesn't adequately compensate providers for the true cost of care.",120,,
964,0.97,7819.344,7826.351,"The only way they do that is to develop a cost of care framework, a real one, to understand what it takes for providers to provide high- quality care for infants and toddlers and all children.",120,,
965,0.97,7826.351,7835.761,"So, we see this as a Foundational step in really thinking about a future subsidy program.",120,,
966,0.97,7835.761,7838.664,We are starting with this process very soon.,120,,
967,0.97,7838.664,7841.767,We will be excited to report back on that.,120,,
968,0.97,7841.767,7852.01,"And then, as we have mentioned already, we will continue to monitor the policy landscape because we don't want to duplicate.",120,,
969,0.97,7852.01,7852.678,We want to complement.,120,,
970,0.97,7852.678,7862.054,We want to fill in any gaps that may remain after Federal and state and county policies take place.,120,,
971,0.97,7862.054,7884.576,"That is sort of the holding pattern we are going to have as we develop the cost of framework, as we implement the Ccap modifications as I mentioned on the first slide, you see the impact of all of those as we prepare for possible future considerations.",120,,
972,0.97,7884.576,7900.392,"So, Cam is going to close out the presentation by talking about, you know, a small subsection of lots of other possibilities that we can entertain for the next year, so, Cam, take it away.",120,,
973,0.97,7900.392,7902.261,We can just move to the next slide.,121,,
974,0.97,7902.261,7909.001,"Okay, thank you.",121,,
975,0.97,7909.001,7913.338,"So, this table on this slide highlights things we want to consider beyond 2021.",121,,
976,0.97,7913.338,7919.811,A lot of it is consultant reports.,121,,
977,0.97,7919.811,7924.85,It is organized by the outcome on the left-hand side.,121,,
978,0.97,7924.85,7927.319,Different policy options we are looking at are on the Right- hand column.,121,,
979,0.97,7927.319,7936.895,"I just want to quickly flag that I made some reports, everyone has the idea to read through them.",121,,
980,0.97,7936.895,7938.563,There are a range of ideas to consider.,121,,
981,0.97,7938.563,7948.674,"Tax credits for businesses, we felt that was outside of our areas of expertise.",121,,
982,0.97,7948.674,7950.375,We didn't necessarily think it was a bad idea.,121,,
983,0.97,7950.375,7968.827,"Others, you know, such as--there is a case study on child's there--Childcare savings account.",121,,
984,0.97,7968.827,7969.895,We were excited to read it.,121,,
985,0.97,7969.895,7971.33,That felt outside of this direct request.,121,,
986,0.97,7971.33,7980.305,"Not that we don't think it's a good idea, that we don't want to move forward on it, but we don't think it is responsive to the CBA, that is why there are examples of that in the reports which aren't included, here.",121,,
987,0.97,7980.305,7982.607,So I'm going to do a quick summary of the recommendations.,121,,
988,0.97,7982.607,7983.775,I won't spend too much time.,121,,
989,0.97,7983.775,7984.843,Then we can move to questions.,121,,
990,0.97,7984.843,7999.624,"In the demand side, you can potentially look at Piloting or Slot-Based contracts.",121,,
991,0.97,7999.624,8001.693,We think it could have a great impact on toddler work.,121,,
992,0.97,8001.693,8009.935,"Essentially, this would be creating service contracts with Childcare providers, Reserve slots, almost like in the housing world you might think about project vouchers at the site.",121,,
993,0.97,8009.935,8013.038,This is [Indiscernible]. It would allow for spots to seek out eligible families.,121,,
994,0.97,8013.038,8026.351,"What is exciting about that, it provides opportunities to layer things for the contract for professional development coaching issues we want--it is an interesting pilot we want to look at for next year.",121,,
995,0.97,8026.351,8037.629,"We want to look at capping family Copayments--I mean, Ccap families pay 15 to 20% of their income in Copayments.",121,,
996,0.97,8037.629,8039.765,There's a lot of national work at indexing that around 10%.,121,,
997,0.97,8039.765,8055.547,We want to make sure we are taking the Co-Pay structure and changing the index down to something around that area.,121,,
998,0.97,8055.547,8058.083,"Thirdly, we want to make sure we are doing more responsive outreach.",121,,
999,0.97,8058.083,8088.38,"There is a lot of good material in both reports on how we could be more focused in communities that reach different communities--how we could meet--work with partners on outreach, that's what we want to move forward in 2022--Lastly, family friend or neighbor is the type--you know, it is a choice that a lot of families make them especially on the infant and toddler side.",121,,
1000,0.97,8088.38,8091.116,There are Childcare resources--they were here earlier presented what's best for kids.,121,,
1001,0.97,8091.116,8095.02,They do a lot of work in this area for kids--we do not do very much work.,121,,
1002,0.97,8095.02,8105.23,"We want to look at how we can be a positive contributor and have a more defined strategy for family, friend and neighbor, Bipoc seven moving on to the business side, there are areas where we can have an incentive model for providers to take [Indiscernible].",121,,
1003,0.97,8105.23,8110.035,"There are some good examples out of Jersey, specifically that we want to look at in that area.",121,,
1004,0.97,8110.035,8120.512,"Also, building off what Monica talked about in the previous slide, when we do that--we want to make sure we are adjusting the subsidies to pay the true cost of care.",121,,
1005,0.97,8120.512,8132.524,"We know, you know, family--you know, tuition doesn't mean the cost, it is awfully subsidized by preschool families.",121,,
1006,0.97,8132.524,8137.028,So we want to make sure we are adjusting subsidies properly for that so we will be looking at that as well.,121,,
1007,0.97,8137.028,8152.144,"The quality side, we are fortunate to have text funds to provide coaching and professional development at the Ccap classrooms.",121,,
1008,0.97,8152.144,8153.778,We want to continue to strengthen the work.,121,,
1009,0.97,8153.778,8164.289,"Then moving down to systemic alignment, we want to look at issues like changing the Federal poverty level two area median income because it Aligns more with what is in the housing world and other things happening in the city, it also has [Indiscernible] in the Seattle area.",121,,
1010,0.97,8164.289,8168.193,"Also, alignment starts with kids, then the last two in this are thinking about systems groups we can put together.",121,,
1011,0.97,8168.193,8184.009,"Úobviously, we just got off Thi agenda item from the built environment, we think there is rich opportunities for Oh hop CD deal to do more long-range--you heard the challenges of retrofitting Childcare in spaces that weren't designed for it.",121,,
1012,0.97,8184.009,8190.382,How can we do it and be intentional about [Indiscernible]? there are number of good ideas how to include business in this work in the reports.,121,,
1013,0.97,8190.382,8201.026,We haven't sat down with business formally--there would be opportunities to do that.,121,,
1014,0.97,8201.026,8204.529,"Lastly, on the supply side, you know, we think funds specifically dedicated to toddler spaces is important.",121,,
1015,0.97,8204.529,8206.932,"Preschool often takes up funds, especially for bigger projects.",121,,
1016,0.97,8206.932,8213.939,We talked a lot about Predevelopment and making that citywide not just for deal providers or [Indiscernible].,121,,
1017,0.97,8213.939,8233.692,"Lastly, we are keeping our eye on an interesting pilot around the public private subsidy model which pools funds from private businesses and with city funds to create a subsidy with a third party that also contracts with a network of providers.",121,,
1018,0.97,8233.692,8240.832,I think it has a lot of strengths and some interesting components to it.,121,,
1019,0.97,8240.832,8245.77,We want to take a look at that as the pilot continues on and thinks about if that will be appropriate for Seattle.,121,,
1020,0.97,8245.77,8246.771,-- as we move forward.,121,,
1021,0.97,8246.771,8253.578,"So, with that, I think we can move to any questions--any Council members have?",121,,
1022,0.97,8253.578,8256.681,"Thank you, Cameron, really appreciate it.",122,,
1023,0.97,8256.681,8263.855,I have one question related to the work review identified on the system alignment.,122,,
1024,0.97,8263.855,8274.332,I know that the reports mentioned and made suggestions to the environment.,122,,
1025,0.97,8274.332,8282.507,"Also, in that context, talked about housing and Affordability of housing as an additional barrier to Childcare.",122,,
1026,0.97,8282.507,8299.324,"I'm just wondering if that is part of what you envision this work group looking at, or if you are sort of thinking that that is beyond the scope and would be a different opportunity?",122,,
1027,0.97,8299.324,8312.237,"Yeah, I think we initially--and we haven't gone too far with that--I think we envision more how do we do share planning around Childcare facility and development?",123,,
1028,0.97,8312.237,8313.505,So that's certainly an important issue.,123,,
1029,0.97,8313.505,8317.409,I think it's also an issue that can be thought about with our partnership with West arts for kids.,123,,
1030,0.97,8317.409,8334.693,[Indiscernible]. There is a good idea to look at regional alignment for families are being displaced and how we can really be making it look like there is one door for them to make sure they can get [Indiscernible].,123,,
1031,0.97,8334.693,8335.527,Okay.,124,,
1032,0.97,8335.527,8348.673,"Colleagues, any questions or comments on this report, this presentation?",125,,
1033,0.97,8348.673,8353.745,"Councilmember and try to, please.",126,,
1034,0.97,8353.745,8354.479,Just some questions.,127,,
1035,0.97,8354.479,8357.148,"Monica, you mentioned expanding the universe to those in master programs, that's great.",127,,
1036,0.97,8357.148,8363.755,"Can you remind me, do we already include the partnership and trade programs already?",127,,
1037,0.97,8363.755,8384.109,"And then, on page four of the memo you provided, there was a reference to the universal dollar, that the city is expected to potentially receive.",127,,
1038,0.97,8384.109,8388.513,"We know at the national level, the funding for child care facilities and a second funding package is considered additional investment.",127,,
1039,0.97,8388.513,8394.853,Do we know how much of that money would come to the city of Seattle and any firm numbers yet on what that might be in the appropriations process around that?,127,,
1040,0.97,8394.853,8396.588,"I don't believe we know that, yet.",128,,
1041,0.97,8396.588,8397.422,"That second question, no.",129,,
1042,0.97,8397.422,8399.224,It is just a proposal at this point.,129,,
1043,0.97,8399.224,8400.892,I imagine it will change quite a bit.,129,,
1044,0.97,8400.892,8406.431,"And yes, currently,--trade programs are eligible for Ccap.",130,,
1045,0.97,8406.431,8410.001,Thank you.,131,,
1046,0.97,8410.001,8421.045,"I thought that was important to remind folks--Council President, if we have a quick second, can I ask a second question, here?",131,,
1047,0.97,8421.045,8421.446,Please.,132,,
1048,0.97,8421.446,8422.647,Thank you so much.,133,,
1049,0.97,8422.647,8436.294,"On page six of the memo, I think corresponding age 13, I really appreciate the detail process outline and the principles under which you are reviewing the recommendations.",133,,
1050,0.97,8436.294,8442.167,I also see you will be working closely with the Council.,133,,
1051,0.97,8442.167,8462.654,"Can you tell us a little bit more--perhaps, Council President, I apologize if this is a question for you regarding process, but any additional information you have about what the Council might be expecting in terms of the implementation of the recommendations that you outlined, today, or the broader public engagement process around how folks are going to see these initial recommendations get implemented?",133,,
1052,0.97,8462.654,8472.397,"Excited about the pace, just wanted to check in on the process.",133,,
1053,0.97,8472.397,8476.434,"Yeah, I think, maybe, on that question, we can take it--some of this is in tranches, right?",134,,
1054,0.97,8476.434,8510.201,"Some of this is our word years, and that--but certainly, for the policy actions related to the summer of 2021, specifically around the Ccap modifications, I would also be interested in knowing if that is something within the discretion and the authority of Deel without legislation, or if legislation is going to be required to sort of effectuate those proposed modifications to the Ccap program.",134,,
1055,0.97,8510.201,8514.772,We are operating under the assumption that there is no legislation necessary for us to make these policy changes for Ccap.,135,,
1056,0.97,8514.772,8533.725,"We--it is under our authority to modify those policies, you know, in terms of process, one of the wonderful things about the CBA's is when we conducted a lot of outreach.",135,,
1057,0.97,8533.725,8539.43,So we feel confident that these recommendations are things that will be embraced by providers and families.,135,,
1058,0.97,8539.43,8544.969,"So, in other words, the outreach has already been done --",136,,
1059,0.97,8544.969,8558.616,"Yeah, so these recommendations are what came forth from the reports which included outreach with both Ccap providers and Childcare providers in Seattle that are part of Ccap and families as well.",137,,
1060,0.97,8558.616,8587.912,"So, we are happy with--you know, we should be able to move forward on these, and they Resonated also, you know, with what we believed, with what staff sees as well, and gives us the opportunity to see what the impact is of these as soon as we started Lamenting.",137,,
1061,0.97,8587.912,8591.783,"Yeah, well I'm excited to see the Ccap modifications in particular and the whole body of work.",138,,
1062,0.97,8591.783,8595.219,"You know, I have been wanting to expand the eligibility to some of these categories listed here.",138,,
1063,0.97,8595.219,8609.367,"I mean, I think I have been advocating since 2018 to expand the eligibility this way, but you know, I'm glad we are finally in a position where we are able to do that, and I'm looking forward to those policy modifications.",138,,
1064,0.97,8609.367,8615.139,"Councilman the Mosqueda, did you get your full answers question on the Longform one?",138,,
1065,0.97,8615.139,8632.423,I just want to make sure you feel --,138,,
1066,0.97,8632.423,8632.824,Yes.,139,,
1067,0.97,8632.824,8633.458,Any questions?,140,,
1068,0.97,8633.458,8634.859,I know we are running long.,140,,
1069,0.97,8634.859,8635.46,"Okay, great, great.",140,,
1070,0.97,8635.46,8640.965,"Brian, anything to add?",140,,
1071,0.97,8640.965,8642.634,"No, not at this time, thank you.",141,,
1072,0.97,8642.634,8645.536,"Okay, council member Strauss?",142,,
1073,0.97,8645.536,8655.58,"Thank you, Council President, just my nickel thanks to all the departments and education and early learning, thank you for all you do.",143,,
1074,0.97,8655.58,8656.247,You are amazing.,143,,
1075,0.97,8656.247,8658.649,Thank you.,144,,
1076,0.97,8658.649,8665.456,"No, thank you, Councilmember Juarez as well.",145,,
1077,0.97,8665.456,8666.691,Thank you for being with us.,146,,
1078,0.97,8666.691,8670.428,We appreciate your presence as always.,146,,
1079,0.97,8670.428,8678.102,"Thank you so much, president, so much, thank you for being here, today.",147,,
1080,0.97,8678.102,8687.111,"Thank everybody for everything all the time, particularly Brian, thank you, Brian, way to go.",147,,
1081,0.97,8687.111,8689.914,Brian is being thanked for having nothing to add during this presentation.,148,,
1082,0.97,8689.914,8708.399,"[Laughter] well, thanks so much, everybody, really appreciate it, and really appreciate your patience as we are working through these dense, dense presentations.",148,,
1083,0.97,8708.399,8711.002,I think this is good work and I look forward to next steps.,148,,
1084,0.97,8711.002,8712.003,"Director, anything to add?",148,,
1085,0.97,8712.003,8712.637,Any closing remarks?,148,,
1086,0.97,8712.637,8718.342,"No, again, we appreciate the time for forward thinking.",149,,
