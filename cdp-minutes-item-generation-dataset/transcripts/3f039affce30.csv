239,0.97,1851.983,1872.036,Next item is 005-C-001 sponsored by Councilmember Strauss to add $1.3 million general fund it to the Osd for the fresh box program.,68,,
240,0.97,1872.103,1884.415,This may be used to program funds for farmers markets and fresh fruit and produce.,68,,
241,0.97,1884.482,1891.522,"This would have added $1.8 million for this purpose, which was equal to 3600 vouchers.",68,,
242,0.97,1891.589,1905.737,"This amount was comprised of 1.3 million general Fund and $500,000 in food and beverage tax proceeds that would have been transferred from the Department of neighborhoods healthy food Fund.",68,,
243,0.97,1905.803,1911.042,This option before you only moves forward with the general fund portion that was included in that option.,68,,
244,0.97,1911.109,1913.378,It does not shift any sweetened beverage tax funding.,68,,
245,0.97,1913.444,1916.114,Thank you very much.,69,,
246,0.97,1916.18,1923.621,Councilmember Strauss?,69,,
247,0.97,1923.688,1932.163,As Yolanda will clear 2600 people out of the Waitlist of 3664 to join the fresh bucks program.,70,,
248,0.97,1932.23,1957.155,"The previous proposal relied on that $500,000 from the sweetened beverage tax revenue and hearing from SPD advisory board, we are reducing this amount to the 1.3 million SPD can use that 500,000 to get the healthy food fund Ramped up faster.",70,,
249,0.97,1957.221,1972.403,"That $500,000 is still being used to increase access to fresh food during this time and this funding will complement the other amendments so that we have many different ways that people can have access to fresh food that they need.",70,,

254,0.97,1990.121,1993.291,"Yes, thank you for the clarification on how we will be using the dollars.",71,,
255,0.97,1992.357,2010.174,"Initially you saw from the summary, there was about $500,000 that was not going to be used until later in the year and in an effort to try to get as much fresh food available out to the community as possible, we felt we could Frontload that to the fresh bucks program.",71,,
256,0.97,2010.241,2035.733,It is good to hear the sweetened beverage tax has plans that to actually Frontload those dollars and use it all in 2021 and start getting food out through culturally competent food partners to a more diverse community . We are honoring that work as Councilmember Strauss said and were making sure we are taking care of the backlog work of the fresh bucks program.,71,,
257,0.97,2035.8,2045.243,The combination of those two programs equal the same amount of money and there is a slightly more emphasis on the healthy food Fund.,71,,
258,0.97,2045.309,2051.182,Great partnership.,71,,
259,0.97,2045.309,2051.682,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",71,,

268,0.97,2096.561,2111.309,I was going to say that every dollar that the Council APPROVES is going to be put to social and beneficial use.,75,,
269,0.97,2111.375,2120.384,"On the 10th of this month in an article written by Erica Barnett, we have seen Evictions are still happening.",75,,
270,0.97,2120.451,2147.278,"Data shows that in the month of October, nearly 40 people were evicted in King County, which was up from just 8 in April, so it is clear they can start targeting and exploiting Renters once again.",75,,
271,0.97,2147.345,2158.022,"On top of that, obviously this shows we need as much funding as Possiblefor Eviction defense to be provided.",75,,
272,0.97,2158.089,2163.728,We know from overwhelming testimonials that having a trained attorney to help you makes all the difference in whether or not an Eviction ends up on your record.,75,,
273,0.97,2163.794,2166.364,It makes a huge difference.,75,,
274,0.97,2166.43,2196.227,"Any rent her, anybody who has rented for any length of time would know exactly what all of that means, but in addition to all of that, we are now seeing, and this is an article that is really important, rich talks about how the lobby is starting to pressure the state government and the governor to relate water down the moratorium because the moratorium has to be updated.",75,,
275,0.97,2196.294,2198.062,We don't think the pandemic will end anytime soon.,75,,
276,0.97,2198.129,2199.664,We have just seen a new spike here.,75,,
277,0.97,2199.73,2216.948,Now we are seeing a push from landlord lobby to say there will be all kinds of conditions to prove why you can't pay rent and we see from all kinds of data going back decades that actually there is very little substance to this.,75,,
278,0.97,2217.014,2230.127,"Ordinary people, poor people, cash-strapped and working-class people end up abusing the services or benefits.",75,,
279,0.97,2230.194,2231.762,Actually there is very little data to show that.,75,,
280,0.97,2231.829,2267.565,"In addition to the data we have from decades together, we also have testimonials from advocates who are very clear from all the anecdotal evidence they are seeing that willful nonpayment is not a problem and they are convinced, as am I and as the people's budget is that requiring proof of hardship cannot be administered easily whether it is a municipal or state government and it could create massive problems and a lot of people would have to correct.",75,,
281,0.97,2267.632,2269.2,We are heading into a very difficult situation.,75,,
282,0.97,2269.266,2271.168,Even more difficult then this year will be next year.,75,,
283,0.97,2271.235,2274.038,All of the resources we have for Eviction defense will come into good use.,75,,

291,0.97,2338.469,2390.821,"The action would only transfer the contract and would also, in a separate action, would add $1 million to support other different kinds of contract mental health workers . This is an action that the committee has seen before, the movement of the mental health providers that are on SPD's crisis response team, actually not the providers themselves but just the contract to Hst, the change in this item is that the $1 million before had been going to the RT but in this particular version, it will go to support the creation or expansion of Neighborhood-Bas Ed teams of mental health and substance abuse disorder professionals.",78,,
292,0.97,2390.888,2408.672,"These professionals would respond to individuals experiencing behavioral health issues, particularly those experiencing on sheltered homelessness and they would be offered the services through a program that is similar to the homeless outreach Stabilization and transition team.",78,,

303,0.97,2498.762,2509.44,Adds $1 million to support mental health outreach response programs such as the host team that Greg discussed.,80,,

314,0.97,2591.555,2608.772,"By way of background, resolution 31962 was passed by the Council last summer and there was a request for report on what kind of Nonlaw enforcement functions might be transferred from SPD to Sfd.",83,,
315,0.97,2608.839,2627.858,"This particular action is one that the Council has seen before . The only difference with this option is that there are some specific requests around this report that our new, but they really just go to a level of detail that is consistent with the original request.",83,,
316,0.97,2627.925,2636.2,"With that, as I said, it is sponsored by Councilmember Strauss.",83,,
317,0.97,2636.266,2636.6,Excellent.,84,,
318,0.97,2636.667,2637.601,"Councilmember Strauss, please go ahead.",84,,
319,0.97,2637.668,2646.844,"As we heard earlier year, we passed 3196 which included an analysis of how that could be transferred from SPD and into the fire Department.",85,,
320,0.97,2646.91,2664.828,"I know that with so many different things going on, I had requested and maybe I didn't communicate clearly enough that I would like this proviso to also look at if these functions can be transferred into the fire Department or into the community safety Department.",85,,
321,0.97,2664.895,2671.735,I know that my team has worked with Allied to understand that change could happen in January when we officially adopt this.,85,,
322,0.97,2671.802,2681.412,I would like to make sure this correction is made during this budget process to avoid any confusion.,85,,
323,0.97,2681.478,2694.491,Councilmember you for filing that.,86,,
324,0.97,2694.558,2699.963,"We will poll this item and if you have a verbal Amendmen that is easy to understand, we would like to see that in writing as well.",86,,
325,0.97,2700.03,2706.97,"If your team already has something in writing, make sure to share that with the crew so we can have something that we can Additionally show folks, but you can make a verbal amendment.",86,,
326,0.97,2707.037,2714.378,My preference is that verbal amendment is also reflected in writing.,86,,
327,0.97,2714.445,2715.212,That is correct.,87,,
328,0.97,2715.279,2724.955,I just want to clarify because I did say you could wait until the Council ADOPTS this at the beginning of the year because I thought it was a slide.,87,,
329,0.97,2725.022,2725.989,That was my bad advice.,87,,
330,0.97,2726.056,2726.99,It is actually a proviso.,87,,
331,0.97,2727.057,2729.026,"Process wise, that would be correct.",87,,
332,0.97,2729.093,2736.066,You can make a verbal amendment and I will work with your team to get that figured out.,87,,
333,0.97,2736.133,2738.969,Great.,88,,
334,0.97,2739.036,2741.205,"Councilmember Herbold, you are off of mute.",88,,
335,0.97,2741.271,2745.676,Thank you.,89,,
336,0.97,2745.742,2752.583,"I will just finish comments here, if that is all right, chair.",90,,
337,0.97,2752.649,2761.925,"While the resolution deadline was in October, SPD indicated it would not be able to respond in that time so instead, we will include this conversation as part of that in our developmental team process.",90,,
338,0.97,2761.992,2778.175,"This provides or restricts $550,000 in the 21 budget, which is about eight month of operating dollars pending the receipt by May 24th, 2021. it ensures there is flexibility.",90,,
339,0.97,2778.242,2786.917,"This should ensure we don't Delete get information, which is valuable and important for future policy choices.",90,,
340,0.97,2786.984,2798.695,I was glad to work with Councilmember Herbold on this as she helped included several specific questions to be proviso act when these were submitted.,90,,
341,0.97,2798.762,2800.531,That is why this is listed in this section.,90,,
342,0.97,2800.597,2828.158,"Again, just for the general population who are watching right now, it is an important function in our Water-Based city and there are a number of different functions that are memorialized through understanding rather than through code and it is important for us to understand which functions of the Department of that harbor patrol are strictly law enforcement and which are civilian based.",90,,
343,0.97,2828.225,2828.759,"Thank you, chair.",90,,
344,0.97,2828.825,2833.63,"Thank you, Greg.",90,,

346,0.97,2834.498,2835.265,Thank you very much.,91,,
347,0.97,2835.332,2839.036,"Councilmember Strauss, let's move onto the next item.",91,,
348,0.97,2839.102,2847.844,"156 Spd-021-A-001, sponsored by you, Madam chair.",92,,
349,0.97,2847.911,2858.622,It is a statement of legislative intent that would require SPD submit to the Council a report that provides recommendations on the Militarizing the police force.,92,,
350,0.97,2858.689,2874.438,"The report should focus on enacting new policies that would include a limitation of purchasing of assault rifles, High-Caliber munitions, armored vehicles, and armored vehicles that would be used by tactical units.",92,,
351,0.97,2874.504,2901.665,"Assessing the use, style, and display of tactical body armor during demonstrations, training programs that would focus officer mindset on citizens service and protection, assessing additional uniform options for minimizing the visibility of weapons and equipment while recognizing employee well-being and safety, and Prioritizing citizen safety and well-being over protection of property.",92,,
352,0.97,2901.732,2905.535,"Thank you very colleagues, this is something we have talked about for a number of years.",93,,
353,0.97,2905.602,2922.786,"We have heard Anecdotally stories of individual officers who have been showing up at recent protests, especially showing up to protest in support of black lives who they themselves have said, you know, why am I showing up in otherwise military outfits?",93,,
354,0.97,2922.853,2933.997,"Why is there a response that would indicate there ready to go to battle instead of showing up in, you know, their bike uniform or something like that?",93,,
355,0.97,2934.064,2935.332,That is a little less Intimidating.,93,,
356,0.97,2935.399,2948.211,"Also, we have heard directly from the inspector general and the office of police accountability that often the situations have been escalated by the presence of police and the type of equipment that they have.",93,,
357,0.97,2948.278,2953.05,I think this can also escalate the situation and what would want to do is De-Escalate.,93,,
358,0.97,2953.116,2965.862,I have also headed conversation directly with the chief about this and I think there is potentially strong shared interest in evaluating the type of equipment that is currently being purchased.,93,,
359,0.97,2965.929,2971.335,I would very much like to limit the supply line items from being able to be used for items like this.,93,,
360,0.97,2971.401,3000.897,"We are currently undergoing a review process of how we use and purchase our crowd control weapons . I think until that happens, this is a step to make sure we are looking across the board about how we can create a more approachable force that is not Militarized, is not spending millions of dollars on things like tanks and other equipment.",93,,
361,0.97,3000.964,3005.902,I appreciate there is some shared interest there both in terms of the front-line officers and potentially within the Department as well as within the community.,93,,
362,0.97,3005.969,3019.683,"With that, I would encourage us all to think about the ways in which this type of report could be helpful in future efforts as well.",93,,
363,0.97,3019.75,3021.118,"Councilmember Herbold, anything to add to that?",93,,
364,0.97,3021.184,3021.518,Sure.,94,,
365,0.97,3021.585,3027.424,I want to thank you for identifying this issue and sharing that there is some alignment from the police chief on our goals here.,94,,
366,0.97,3027.491,3030.06,I appreciate knowing that.,94,,
367,0.97,3030.127,3031.061,Thank you very much.,95,,
368,0.97,3031.128,3049.546,"Let's move to the next item .'s four 157 Spl-001-B-001, it is sponsored by Councilmember Lewis and it requests the library open curbside pickup at all branches or do in branch service at 25% capacity.",95,,
369,0.97,3049.613,3053.25,I am very Councilmember Lewis?,96,,
370,0.97,3053.316,3065.996,Thank you so talked about this a couple of times already during the deliberations over the budget.,97,,
371,0.97,3066.062,3089.786,"Since last time we have discussed it, we have received feedback from the library as well as feedback from the Union to represent employees in the library to make sure we are being cognizant of how to do this in a way that is safe and recognizing the limitations of Covid and the governor's orders now more than ever as we are facing another wave of those orders.",97,,
372,0.97,3089.853,3144.608,"I think it is important in times of really strong adversity, like this, where folks are needing to Sequester at home to have at their access the full resources of the Seattle library system, and particularly for people who have difficulty Accessing purely Digital or purely remote connections . I think there is a way to go even further and beyond what we have done, which is commendable in terms of allowing some branches to have curbside pickup, but I think as we confront this, we should follow the lead of some other regional library systems, including King County, which has had a very robust process at allowing more access to their physical collections and allowing it in more branches.",97,,
373,0.97,3144.674,3153.55,"So, that is essentially what this is requesting and I look forward to it being incorporated into the budget.",97,,
374,0.97,3153.617,3155.385,Thank you very much.,98,,
375,0.97,3155.452,3157.287,I appreciate you bringing this forward.,98,,
376,0.97,3157.354,3161.191,"Okay, let's keep",99,,
377,0.97,3161.258,3169.599,I am Dan Eder.,100,,
378,0.97,3169.666,3187.684,"600-A-001 . It is sponsored by Councilmember Lewis, which would add approximately $2.4 million of a one-time general fund to the 2021 budget for the purpose of implementing a clean cities initiative.",100,,
379,0.97,3187.751,3204.134,"This action would add funding to the budgets of Seattle parks and recreation, the Seattle Department of transportation, Seattle public utilities, and the office of economic development for a four month surge in a variety of cleanup and related activities.",100,,
380,0.97,3204.2,3227.29,"A separate budget action, Blg2B3, that separate budget action would amend the third quarter supplemental to add $720,000 for the same purpose in 2020.",100,,

382,0.97,3241.171,3253.283,Central staff analyst and I are standing by if there are questions about the types of activities and level of funding that this would provide in each of the affected departments.,100,,
383,0.97,3253.35,3260.19,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Lewis.",101,,
384,0.97,3257.621,3269.532,I will turn it back over to you.,101,,
385,0.97,3269.599,3271.001,"Thank you so much, chair.",102,,
386,0.97,3271.067,3277.34,"If there are technical questions, I will refer to Dan but I have a spreadsheet and my disposal of the the specific breakdown.",102,,
387,0.97,3277.407,3302.866,"As I go out and do a lot of these Walk-Throughs of Unsanctioned Encampments, and I know this has been echoed by other members of the Council here as well, Councilmember Morales in particular, one thing is the desire for a more regular and efficient removal of garbage and trash from a lot of these encampment sites.",102,,
388,0.97,3302.932,3319.683,I know that is an area of mutual interest with businesses that are near Unsanctioned Encampments as well as residents of nearby buildings who are living housed.,102,,
389,0.97,3319.749,3352.282,"This goes a long way toward demonstrating how we can respond and effectively remove the garbage and waste associated with really how any human being lives, but what we take for granted by having the dependable service that we get by being housed and having a regular garbage pickup . This incorporates some things that",102,,
390,0.97,3352.348,3365.995,"Ave been and other Councilmembers have led on, particularly Councilmember Morales and the expansion of the purple bag program, which is incorporated into this.",103,,
391,0.97,3366.062,3390.186,I think it really does represent a good effort to come together on this issue to mitigate the impact we are seeing from a lot of Unsanctioned Encampments and provide the service that a lot of us take for granted and we should be extending to everybody in the state.,103,,
392,0.97,3390.253,3391.221,Thank you so much.,104,,
393,0.97,3391.287,3392.822,Are there any additional comments on this item?,104,,

397,0.97,3406.936,3408.471,I know they were originally asking for 5.6.,107,,
398,0.97,3408.538,3426.856,"I think this is a good place to land and a good beginning because, again, I want to stress that increasing the trash pickup to Proactively increase cleaning in parks and open spaces, to help manage issues of trash while working to preserve livelihoods is very important.",107,,
399,0.97,3426.923,3454.017,"I think I shared this sentiment last week as well that I believe that two sides of the equation are reaching out to people on the ground, providing services and directing people and navigating them to shelter, and the other side of the equation is picking up the piles and piles of trash and all of the other issues that we see in our parks and green spaces.",107,,
400,0.97,3454.083,3460.256,"Also, I had an opportunity, which I'm sure you all did as well, to look at the clean city route analysis in the neighborhoods that they will first be looking at.",107,,
401,0.97,3460.323,3468.198,"This is in South Seattle, Georgetown, little Saigon, Capitol Hill, Ballard, University district, Aurora, and Lake city.",107,,
402,0.97,3468.264,3490.353,"I think this is a really good start, looking at the heat map where we need it most and I really want to commend superintendent and staff . In light of Covid, I don't believe they have had to lay off one person.",107,,
403,0.97,3490.42,3523.253,"In fact, their staff has been so flexible and so good to be on the Frontlines of taking their regular job and being deployed to do other jobs, mainly laser focused on cleaning up the trash and beyond Handwashing stations, I am talking, you know, couches, TVs, Grills, mattresses, tents, needles . I am really thankful and I want to thank Councilmember Lewis for bringing this forward.",107,,
404,0.97,3523.319,3527.757,I think this is really needed and I hope we can move forward on this and this is a starting point.,107,,
405,0.97,3527.824,3547.81,"Hopefully we can move hand in hand with what we have passed earlier in getting our North and navigators and South end navigators on the ground to work hand in hand with parks and cleaning up all of these open spaces, public spaces, green spaces, and parks.",107,,
406,0.97,3547.877,3548.211,Thank you.,107,,

411,0.97,3556.819,3558.988,I am excited we will be seeing more trash pickup.,109,,
412,0.97,3559.055,3576.472,"As everybody knows, that is certainly something that our neighborhood business districts can benefit from, our residential areas can benefit from, so I am glad to see that happening.",109,,
413,0.97,3576.539,3586.149,I just want to state for the record that our office will be playing a role in watching how this plays out.,109,,
414,0.97,3586.215,3594.924,We have navigation team members already doing some of the works in the parks.,109,,
415,0.97,3590.753,3608.738,"These folks were responsible for determining whether something qualified or, you know, obstructed a sighting so a sweep could have been.",109,,
416,0.97,3608.805,3635.765,"On one hand, I am happy this is moving forward because everybody can see clearly that we need additional trash pickup throughout the city . I want to say that we will be very interested to see how this unfolds and my hope is that this is a good faith effort on everyone's part to ensure that our homeless neighbors don't get caught up in some of the activity that used to be happening through this work.",109,,
417,0.97,3635.832,3637.333,Thank you very much.,110,,
418,0.97,3637.4,3642.271,Well said.,110,,

421,0.97,3648.144,3650.013,This will be additive to that program that you mentioned.,110,,
422,0.97,3650.079,3655.685,"I appreciate the Mayor's office Úworking with Councilmembers, especially Councilmember Lewis.",110,,
423,0.97,3655.752,3681.11,"I understand that, yes, the original request was north of $5 million but they scaled it down to $3.12 million, so we are really meeting them at that figure here and hoping, as the Councilmembers have noted, we continue to see Holistic services offered in addition to that plan that we know is so critical.",110,,
424,0.97,3681.177,3696.726,"And Lastly, Councilmember Juarez mentioned this earlier last week and Councilmember Morales had a lot to say on this.",111,,
425,0.97,3696.793,3701.564,I think it is important we are providing public health services to our community at large.,111,,

601,0.97,4995.557,5015.343,I support a Tweeted out increase to the vehicle licensing fee because I believe it is necessary to support the ongoing operations of our city's transit services and the maintenance of our transportation infrastructure and networks.,167,,

609,0.97,5090.285,5113.508,The substitute budget action proposes the anticipated $3.6 million in 2021 revenue be held under a proviso until the city led by S.Canon form a spending plan to Prioritize these funds.,167,,
610,0.97,5113.575,5123.485,"This requires the $3.6 million collected in 2021, which is the total amount that can be collected in 2021, be spent only on bridge maintenance.",167,,
611,0.97,5123.551,5141.569,"And Additionally would require within the outward years, the city of Seattle spent the fully collected $7.2 million per year on only bridge maintenance.",167,,
612,0.97,5141.636,5143.505,"In contrast, my substitute budget action is not prescriptive.",167,,
613,0.97,5143.571,5167.328,"In other words, if adopted by the Council, by budget action does not prohibit the use of any of this revenue for bridge maintenance, rather my substitute budget action parks this revenue and finance general and requires the city of Seattle engage in a meaningful Stakeholder process that will guide the future expenditures within the lawful boundaries of the existing city and state law.",167,,
614,0.97,5167.395,5170.365,Some say they're not comfortable imposing a tax without a defined spending plan in place.,167,,
615,0.97,5170.431,5172.467,I have two responses to that argument or concern.,167,,
616,0.97,5172.534,5187.849,"First, while opponents have used that reasoning to try to defeat tax proposals in the past, this is not a new tax.",167,,
617,0.97,5187.916,5193.755,The existing $20 vehicle licensing fee is a Well- established fee that is guided by state and city statutes that limit and direct how this revenue may be spent.,167,,
618,0.97,5193.821,5204.566,It authorizes transportation benefit districts and SETS parameters for how these revenues can be spent and dictates they must be dedicated to transportation uses while giving local jurisdictions discretion over how to best Prioritize spending.,167,,
619,0.97,5204.632,5219.547,I believe that those statutory parameters predefined the contours of our spending plan and what is at issue here is how to Prioritize the spending of these dollars within those lawful boundaries.,167,,
620,0.97,5219.614,5234.095,"I believe it is critical we get valued Stakeholders and community members the opportunity to advise the city on how to Prioritize the use of these dollars and the context of our broader investments in the Seattle transportation benefit district, transit services, and our transportation infrastructure.",167,,
621,0.97,5234.162,5252.246,"Second, if Councilmembers share the concern it will be prudent to pass the licensing fee without a spending plan in place now, the answer is not to jam this the in the last phase of our budget process.",167,,
622,0.97,5252.313,5274.569,"Rather I believe the prudent and reasonable solution to that concern would be to pull this proposed Council bill action altogether and instead established a Stakeholder process, conduct the engagement, receive recommendations and deliberately spending plan and fee at the same time with the benefit of Stakeholder and taxpayer and put on how these dollars will be authorized including bridge maintenance.",167,,
623,0.97,5274.636,5310.338,"Again, the only difference between my proposal and the proposal made by Councilmembers Pedersen, Herbold, and Lewis is related to the Stakeholder engagement process and what it should look like in terms of how it should guide our decision-making and the Department's decision-making around how these dollars should be expended . It is absolutely possible that engagement process will conclude that a portion of the dollars collected",167,,
624,0.97,5319.047,5374.402,"My preference would pass the legislation now to allow the Stakeholder process to occur, I did have a conversation with director, SAMSON Bob wade this morning via Email, he did indicate that he would want to see perhaps a shorter Stakeholder engagement process for the Departments of greater certainty around Operationalizing any sort of spending plan and so my hope is that before Monday, if there I an amendment to be made, we will be able to work with counsel staff and the Department to identify that small technical change to a Timeline related to the Stakeholder engagement process and the outside date of when counsel would consider adoption of a spending plan.",168,,
625,0.97,5374.469,5374.802,Thank you.,168,,
626,0.97,5374.869,5388.349,"Thank you very President, I appreciate you walking us through that explanation, and I will turn it over to Councilmember Alex Pedersen as the original sponsor of this item, and if there's others, thank you very much.",169,,
627,0.97,5388.416,5418.146,"Thank you chair Teresa Mosqueda, that was a very well said response to this issue and to your substitute and I want to say thank you to Councilmember Andrew Lewis as well for teaming up on this, Seattle is defined by its waterways and ravines, so we rely on the bridges to connect us and keep the economy moving by safely carrying multiple modes of travel.",170,,
628,0.97,5418.212,5420.681,"When there's no bridge, there's no transportation choices.",170,,
629,0.97,5420.748,5443.471,"I took a tour of the bridge yesterday, I was inside the bridge, the maintenance needs are tremendous there, it was a really Eye-Opening experience when we consider all of the other bridges that connect our city . maintaining the bridges takes money and experts, not more process or lobbying at City Hall.",170,,
630,0.97,5443.538,5449.01,We have been discussing for months the need for more bridge maintenance throughout the city ever since the West Seattle high bridge cracked and closed.,170,,
631,0.97,5449.076,5464.225,"The city auditor started work on a citywide bridge assessment which received several weeks ago, showing the bridges throughout the city are aging and in disrepair, they need more maintenance dollars now.",170,,
632,0.97,5464.292,5475.436,We have been discussing for months the need to overturn I 976 because the vehicle licenses are vital to transportation projects and programs as authorized by state law.,170,,
633,0.97,5475.503,5506.868,"And as Council President pointed out, it will drop to $20 now, so this underlying legislation would take it to $40, so we can do all we can for transportation next year and as Calvin pointed out, we are going to do this on our own, we all support transit bridges, as we await a vaccine for Covid and transit Ridership to recover after plummeting sharply this year after the pandemic.",170,,
634,0.97,5506.934,5537.031,"The bridge audit that we have received concludes we have an urgent need today to increase maintenance of our bridge infrastructure, so the budget form C enables us to make a larger down payment to this priority and focus it on our frequent transit network, and this is just for 2021, so it's not prescriptive beyond 2021.",170,,
635,0.97,5537.098,5545.573,"Despite the sharp loss in transit Ridership including bus Ridership this year due to the pandemic, that is Spiking again, I know we are optimistic about the future, we want to make sure our economy recovers and transit Ridership along with it.",170,,
636,0.97,5545.64,5551.312,"So this bill is just about $3.6 million for bridge maintenance, just for next year.",170,,
637,0.97,5551.379,5570.598,There are many more dollars available for transit service hours in 2021 due to it being over a $23 million reserve left over from the expiring SPD.,170,,
638,0.97,5574.468,5576.337,We are trying to add to bridge maintenance.,170,,
639,0.97,5576.404,5579.106,That is in addition to the dollars overwhelmingly approved by voters this past November.,170,,
640,0.97,5579.173,5598.359,"So, as part of future meetings of our transportation and utilities Committee, working with the staff, transit advisory board, the levy oversight committee, the Workgroup, labor unions, other Stakeholders who are planning out a process for these much larger sums of money, the amount for bridge maintenance and balancing packages is welcome but falls short.",170,,
641,0.97,5598.426,5602.697,Approving the dollars for bridge maintenance now is important to enable Sdot to recruit additional inspectors and engineers now.,170,,
642,0.97,5602.763,5617.345,I don't believe we met many more months to determine whether the bridges are breaking order to determine how to spend $3.6 million when we are literally hatching a $6.5 million budget this Monday.,170,,
643,0.97,5617.411,5627.855,"So I would urge my colleagues to support the original form C, for 2021, we can have this additional increment for bridge maintenance.",170,,
644,0.97,5627.922,5629.523,"In short, buses need bridges, too.",170,,
645,0.97,5629.59,5641.168,"Our measure focus is on these dollars in the frequent transit network, we cannot ignore the audit and transit funding will increase as transit demand increases.",170,,
646,0.97,5641.235,5641.435,Thank you.,170,,
647,0.97,5641.502,5649.11,"Thank you member Tammy Morales, you are next.",171,,
648,0.97,5649.176,5673.634,"Thank you, say thank you to our friends at the transportation choices coalition, and the eight other signatories and the letter they sent to counsel November 17 which was yesterday, and I want to say thank you to Councilmember Alex Pedersen and his timely response to the concerns raised by Tcc and the other eight as I said signatories.",172,,
649,0.97,5673.701,5693.721,"Councilmember, Alex Pedersen raised eight important points to respond to the community concerns that were raised and without going into detail because he can speak for himself, but form what I have read, this is 3.6 million for the year of 2021.",172,,
650,0.97,5693.788,5696.791,I do have faith in the bridge audit.,172,,
651,0.97,5696.857,5737.998,"And I just wanted to share two other major points, first that I think it's important to note that the Plf can be used for a variety of transportation projects including infra structure maintenance and capital improvements, but before I get there, I want to say something to general, I am a member of the Puget sound regional Council transportation Committee, and also a member of sound transit and I want to share my meeting with Mr. Jerry white, the new GM at Metro.",172,,
652,0.97,5738.065,5748.309,"Starting with the Puget sound regional Council, they are working on the regional equity strategy, a lot of Stakeholder involvement in meetings about Tcc, and they were able to provide comments as well.",172,,
653,0.97,5748.375,5769.263,"The progress report on the work to support other marginalized communities, looking at opportunity maps, mortgage lending, all of these practices, these institutionalized practices that prevent an excluded targeted communities from transportation, wealth, equity and access.",172,,
654,0.97,5769.33,5801.162,"In our discussions with Esther white, the Newbie GM at Metro, they are also doing an equity analysis, so they are doing equity strategy, Metro is doing their analysis, again with Stakeholder groups, mobility framework, with the equity cabinet of 23 members, many of which are part of Tcc and these other groups that have signed on to the letter.",172,,
655,0.97,5801.228,5808.702,"Not only discussing about bus routes and realignment in bus routes and emphasis in South Seattle, but how we look at transportation and shifting resources to the South end.",172,,
656,0.97,5808.769,5812.373,"As a member of sound transit, I will tell you my main concern.",172,,
657,0.97,5812.439,5835.296,"That every meeting, whether it is the board meeting or the subcommittee meetings, the topic all the time is the bridges, particularly West Seattle and Ballard in light of the fact that we are hoping we get light rail to West Seattle in 2030 and we get light rail to Ballard in 2035.",172,,
658,0.97,5835.362,5860.521,"I really appreciate what counsel President Gonzales said, but I think the times are little bit different about having a six month time for Stakeholder when we know the emergent factor now is we have a bridge that is not working.",172,,
659,0.97,5866.56,5881.342,"And my concern is this, and I learned this from Metro, thank you, I told him I would use this because I think it sums it up for me, looking at these equity strategies, these equity plans, equity analysis, I think we already kind of know we have a bridge and others that we need to look at, that we have to be value driven and data informed.",172,,
660,0.97,5881.408,5893.053,"So, Metro Psr C, the transportation committee and sound transit are discussing and implementing mobility plans, bus service, making sure that we are looking at those areas that need it the most and a primary emphasis on equity.",172,,
661,0.97,5893.12,5900.861,"So all those voices are being heard in these three different areas, regionally and citywide for bus services, routes and are many of the issues that Tcc shared in their letter.",172,,
662,0.97,5900.928,5911.672,"I'm not inclined to support Council President substitute, however, I think she offered an excellent solution, if it is in six months, perhaps three months.",172,,
663,0.97,5911.739,5926.82,"That I'm more inclined to support, to substitute with a shorter Timeline in light of the circumstances of basically one of our main bridges, West Seattle bridge being down and the other four bridges that the audit looked at.",172,,
664,0.97,5926.887,5951.111,"For me, I can't support the substitute in its current form and I'm certainly open to supporting the substitute if we went from 6 to 3 months because again, we have to emphasize, this is 3.6 million for 2021, during Covid the West Seattle bridge down, that is the reason why we had the audit done and also looking at the Ballard bridge as well.",172,,
665,0.97,5951.178,5953.347,"I will leave it at that, thank you.",172,,
666,0.97,5953.414,5956.984,Thank you very much.,173,,
667,0.97,5957.051,5959.32,"Councilmember, Kshama Sawant.",173,,
668,0.97,5959.386,5984.545,"Thank you, I will be supporting the substitution presented by Gonzales, committee organizations like the transit riders Union have advocated for the opportunity to weigh in on how this funding will be used and the substitution will give them the time to do so.",174,,
669,0.97,5984.611,5991.985,"I will mention after this vote, I intend to move a second substitution which my office sent to you all over Email last night to change the revenue of funding.",174,,
670,0.97,5992.052,6010.404,"I would only change the funding source, increasing big business taxes rather than increasing, so again, I would vote yes for the substitution and I will make this vote and motion after this is decided.",174,,
671,0.97,6010.471,6013.273,"Thank you, any comments?",175,,
672,0.97,6013.34,6016.176,Councilmember Lisa Herbold?,175,,
673,0.97,6016.243,6042.803,"Thank you so much, speaking to the substitute here, for us, really appreciate Councilmember Alex Pedersen for his leadership and having this discussion forward, I do feel a great deal of urgency associated with acting on the city auditors recommendation.",176,,
674,0.97,6042.87,6051.345,We don't have a lot of options to address maintenance.,176,,
675,0.97,6051.412,6079.64,"Just a little bit of history on our funding sources for Sdot, some folks might recall that the 2015 levy was set up differently than the previous bridging the gap levy, the previous levy dedicated a higher proportion of funds to maintaining our critical transportation infrastructure, then the current move levy does.",176,,
676,0.97,6079.706,6085.813,And I think that is part of why we are in the position that we are in right now.,176,,
677,0.97,6085.879,6092.586,The move levy goes all the way through 2024.,176,,
678,0.97,6092.653,6111.338,"So that means the Council will not have the opportunity to address levy funding and increasing transportation infrastructure maintenance, a major funding source for that until 2024 and other options for dedicated transportation funding are limited.",176,,
679,0.97,6111.405,6188.515,"And, you know, I'm just having a hard time with the recommendation that we turn over to a citywide transportation Stakeholder group, the question of whether or not we use these funds to address the recommendations of our city auditor, the city council I think is charged with making the tough decisions about how to address recommendations from the city auditor . It's up to the Council and the Mayor to make those recommendations and Seattle municipal code 3.40 point 050 reads, under the section called audit reports, follow-up required, it says it is city policy to follow-up on audit reports by the city auditor . I'm concerned that this creates a troubling precedent that undermines this policy and undermines the seriousness that we are supposed to, with which we are supposed to consider the recommendations of the city auditor and act on it.",176,,
680,0.97,6188.582,6205.432,"And again, I just don't think we should be turning over the question of how to identify the funding to address these recommendations to a citywide Stakeholder group.",176,,
681,0.97,6205.499,6236.096,"I think there has been some conversation about funds that are unspent and are available to add transit capacity, we know that there is about a $20 million reserves from unspent funds from the transportation benefit district that could be available in 2021 for adding additional transit services if it is needed.",176,,
682,0.97,6236.163,6242.869,We do know that there is a 60% reduction in transit right now because of Covid-19.,176,,
683,0.97,6240.167,6269.529,"And the Sdot transportation benefit district plan itself parks $8 million that we thought we would be using for transit and testing 21, again because of this concern that we should not be moving forward in committing spend dollars for capacity until we know that we actually need it.",176,,
684,0.97,6269.596,6305.532,"The moment I heard that one of Sdot's concerns about pursuing a $47 million repair for the West Seattle bridge was in large part due to the $500,000 annual maintenance cost, which is twice the maintenance cost estimate for a new bridge, that is when I ask myself, why would we build a new bridge at nearly 10 times the cost to primarily avoid the higher cost of maintaining the bridge that we have, especially if the experts tell us that we can get another 30 to 40 years out of the bridge that we have.",176,,
685,0.97,6305.599,6314.808,And the answer to that question is because Sdot is not confident that we are going to fulfill our obligation to adequately fund maintenance.,176,,
686,0.97,6314.875,6324.785,"Learning this, really felt like a challenge to me to do my part to be a better steward of our public assets.",176,,
687,0.97,6324.851,6332.959,I think Councilmember Alex Pedersen handle the issue of whether or not bridges are car centric.,176,,
688,0.97,6333.026,6337.631,I reject that notion.,176,,
689,0.97,6333.026,6359.086,"We are proposing to focus funding on bridges that are a part of our frequent transit network in the example of the West Seattle bridge, just an example of one bridge and how it functions like many others do in the frequent transit network.",176,,
690,0.97,6359.152,6375.135,"The West Seattle bridge carried 13 different bus lines, 17 thousand people, and 900 different trips every day.",176,,
691,0.97,6375.202,6403.33,"That bridge is a transit Workhorse and to suggest that our bridge infrastructure primarily serves cars and single occupancy vehicles, I think that is something that we need to really struggle with that definition if we are ever going to do a better job of maintaining these failing public assets.",176,,
692,0.97,6403.396,6409.936,"So, with that, I'm not going to be supporting the substitute, thank you.",176,,
693,0.97,6410.003,6413.073,Thank you very much.,177,,
694,0.97,6413.14,6450.811,"I will Chime in here very briefly before turning it back over to Andrew Lewis, I want to say thank you to Councilmember Alex Pedersen and Louis, for bringing forward the initial piece of legislation and also the CDA included in this consent package, that's why it was in the initial proposal here for us to have it a part of the consent package, but I'm even more supportive of the proposed amendment to the Council President here today.",177,,
695,0.97,6450.877,6460.887,"I think we all know that there is a huge need for additional transportation funding from transit services to services for essential workers, to save if a structure, for people who are walking and Biking.",177,,
696,0.97,6460.954,6479.072,"To make sure that we have the bridge maintenance necessary to make sure the long-term viability of the infrastructure and I want to correct my earlier statement, I do not think it should go unsaid that we know that folks who use transit, or using our buses, they need the bridges to function.",177,,
697,0.97,6479.139,6513.373,"I know having walked over the lower bridge, that bridge has to function for pedestrians and bikers as well, so I want to make sure to correct my earlier statement, I don't want to put infrastructure against other infrastructure investments in our city, so I think that is an important clarification, and I think Lisa Herbold alluded to it, and I wanted to call out directly, those who are using bikes and walking, running in transit, they also use the bridges and it connects the city.",177,,
698,0.97,6513.44,6514.007,So it's incredibly important.,177,,
699,0.97,6514.074,6523.65,"But transparency and inclusion, as we make these decisions about tax dollars is also important about me to comment on.",177,,
700,0.97,6523.717,6558.551,"I'm supportive of the effort to make sure we are pulling together a table to make sure there is an inclusive conversation about identifying strategies or investing in key infra structure and that includes rich maintenance, the conversation will include additional state and Federal sources that we are looking at to make sure that there is a robust plan for how we best leverage these vehicle license fees and I support the Council President amendment because I think that it helps lift up the importance of having folks who are able to come to the table very quickly in early 2021 and have us not to Miss a beat.",177,,
701,0.97,6558.618,6574.501,"The ability to put together a task force is not going to delay us because we see already that the estimated Timeline, if we pass the vehicle licensing Toay, it would take six months to begin collecting the Plf revenue for vital transportation services and infrastructure.",177,,
702,0.97,6574.567,6594.788,"So I'm supportive of passing the package today while we also initiate this inclusive conversation and specified here, with labor, transportation equity groups, with transportation advisory boards and commissions to create as planned a spending plan for the Council to engage in a public and Deliberative process.",177,,
703,0.97,6594.854,6621.047,"Again, there is incredible crossover among various Stakeholders who have already expressed report for the process outlined in the Council President proposal here in addition to hearing from the folks from the mass, I have spoken to leaders and I think they are also interested in making sure that we get investments in bridges, they have been very clear about that.",177,,
704,0.97,6621.114,6641.401,"And other infra structure is important as well and they would like to sit at the table and have these discussions because they see that the data is going to continue to come up, we are going to look at the data and make data informed decisions through a collaborative process with the Stakeholder table.",177,,
705,0.97,6641.468,6649.209,"If there is a reduction in the title and not an expansion, I would be supportive about that as well, because we have a six month process, as long as we are taking those recommendations earlier, great.",177,,
706,0.97,6649.275,6678.004,"But I think that because of the broad Stakeholder support, including the Plf funding today and also creating a Stakeholder task force, I would like to see this as a replacement to the item that was originally considered in the consent package and again, I think this conversation has been spurred by the folks that brought this forward so thank you Councilmember Lisa Herbold, Alex Pedersen, and Andrew Lewis for bringing this forward.",177,,
707,0.97,6678.071,6680.24,And doing some additional research and conversations with Stakeholders as well.,177,,
708,0.97,6680.306,6695.655,"Really important that we do this, get those dollars into the community and invest in the infrastructure, that is so vitally needed and I would love to do that in a way that is more inclusive through the Stakeholder process as identified in the amendment.",177,,
709,0.97,6695.722,6697.123,"Councilmember Andrew Lewis, I believe you are next.",177,,
710,0.97,6697.19,6708.168,"Thank you one of the benefits of going almost last, a lot of my points have already been made from Councilmembers Alex Pedersen and Lisa Herbold.",178,,
711,0.97,6708.234,6731.524,"I want to briefly say that generally, I'm very supportive in a lot of the policies that I have been promoting over the last year to develop Stakeholder processes that involve a broad array of advocates and people, whose interest is going to be affected by city policy.",178,,
712,0.97,6731.591,6764.691,"This is a little different for me today because of the way I see it and Councilmember Lisa Herbold alluded to this, we are acting on a recommendation from the auditor to reach a goal that has been laid out with a sense of urgency that has been made very stark and apparent by the failure of the West Seattle bridge . one point that I want to make from reviewing that audit is while only five bridges are listed in poor condition, and no city should tolerate having five bridges in poor condition, there are 50 bridges listed as fair.",178,,
713,0.97,6764.757,6783.176,"It should be noted the West Seattle bridge was not historically considered a bridge in poor condition, and that these 50 fair bridges today are the poor bridges of tomorrow unless we take assertive action to maintain them adequately.",178,,
714,0.97,6783.243,6795.522,"And really, I think the audit underscores that there is an infrastructure Timebomb that the city is facing and we have chronically under invested in.",178,,
715,0.97,6795.588,6812.906,"The minimum that the audit identified was $34 million, this proposal of the deal as combined with some of the other resources the Council is investing will get us to 18 million I believe which is still far short of that minimum recommendation from the auditor.",178,,
716,0.97,6812.972,6846.873,"So, I think it's really important, I think it's something that we should move on now to make this investment with certainty, certainty that the Department, the Transportation Department needs to be able to really scale up and maintain this vital and important infrastructure and we have seen the impacts of historically under investing in these bridges, manifesting this year with the West Seattle bridge 20 years ago after the earthquake, it was the magnolia break that had a long-term shutdown.",178,,
717,0.97,6846.94,6861.087,"There's a number of other bridges that have been experiencing problems, the Ballard bridge has been stuck in the up position several times in recent months, the University bridges on the poor list and Similarly, a drawbridge had similar problems.",178,,
718,0.97,6861.154,6875.068,"I just want to make sure that we are not putting ourselves in a position whereby refusing to pay today, we will pay a bigger price with unplanned closures down the road if we don't start making more strategic investments in this really critical area.",178,,
719,0.97,6875.134,6886.112,I also want to note that we do still have more authority that could be voter approved as indicated on the transportation benefit district sheet.,178,,
720,0.97,6886.179,6928.454,"I know there has been a lot of talk about potentially doing it Countywide, to Backfill the fair subsidy loss that we have experienced from not having the luxury of being able to do that renewal because of pending litigation . I would be interested in pursuing a Countywide measure wide, and if that is not possible, pursuing a citywide measure, I think that is one more tool in addition to the tools that we said earlier, that could be pursued for fair subsidy and other critical transportation investments.",178,,
721,0.97,6928.521,6946.306,"But in the meantime, I think this is a more modest investment, it would be Well- suited to give the Department transportation and continuing to make is really important investments and bridges all over the city and in all of the districts.",178,,
722,0.97,6946.372,6958.251,"So with that, I don't have anything else to add and I appreciate the conversation.",178,,
723,0.97,6958.318,6960.486,"Excellent, thank you, Council President would you like to closeout discussion?",179,,
724,0.97,6960.553,6969.462,"I would, thank quick rebuttal to some of the arguments that were raised by those who spoke this afternoon, I guess late afternoon now, it's almost 4:00.",180,,
725,0.97,6969.529,7007.533,"Okay, really quickly, I think the sponsors and supporters of the original Council budget action all went through a long list of bridge maintenance needs at the city, and I think somehow I don't believe that there is a need to maintain our bridges in the city of Seattle and I just want to say for the record that that is not an accurate characterization of my position.",180,,
726,0.97,7007.6,7021.581,"There is no question in my mind that bridge maintenance is a need throughout the city, that was bolstered by the recent city auditor findings that concluded there is approximately $100 million worth of bridge maintenance that needs to occur throughout the city.",180,,
727,0.97,7021.647,7060.82,"So, my substitute, which endeavors to acknowledge that bridge maintenance is needed, but also wants to see a Stakeholder process be undertaken, is being read as a denial of the need for bridge maintenance, I want to encourage my colleagues, I want to communicate my colleagues that it is not the case, I agree there is a need for bridge maintenance, when Councilmember Peterson said we don't need a Stakeholder process to determine the bridges are breaking, that is not the Stakeholder process is designed to do as I'm proposing it.",180,,
728,0.97,7060.887,7074.333,The Stakeholder process I believe is necessary in order to guide city council's Decision- making around what the best use of this additional vehicle license fee would be.,180,,
729,0.97,7074.4,7087.28,It is the case that the Stakeholders could determine that bridge maintenance is one of those things that should be Prioritized.,180,,
730,0.97,7087.346,7102.662,"And it would be my hope that those recommendations would also include levels of appropriate appropriation of how to spend those additional dollars on bridge maintenance, given the need identified by the city auditor office.",180,,
731,0.97,7102.728,7122.548,"I will note for the record, and for consideration by Councilmembers who may be undecided on this issue, that when the vehicle license fee was first instituted in 2011, there was a community and Stakeholder process that was undertaken in order to devise and come up with a spending plan.",180,,
732,0.97,7122.615,7128.821,And that was done before the city council inducted the spending plan.,180,,
733,0.97,7128.888,7146.272,"So I think we are out of step by not doing that in this instance and instead, identifying Councilmember, individual Councilmember priorities for purposes of capturing these dollars and using these dollars for only bridges.",180,,
734,0.97,7146.339,7157.75,I want to acknowledge that that is a historical piece of information that are received from Sdot related to developing the spending plan for the BLS.,180,,
735,0.97,7157.817,7160.786,That is one point I wanted to make in terms of the need.,180,,
736,0.97,7160.853,7176.536,"There's also an argument made that it would be a dereliction of our duty to delegate this to a Stakeholder process when we have a city auditor report, telling us that it is an issue, we have an obligation to address it.",180,,
737,0.97,7176.602,7202.328,"I agree that we have an obligation to address the issues identified by the city auditor's, or at least to bridge maintenance, but I suppose I have a difference of opinion on whether or not having a Stakeholder process as part of our responsibility and response to addressing the concerns and as being a dereliction of duty.",180,,
738,0.97,7202.395,7232.825,"I believe that the city auditor's report did not say that bridge maintenance is Paramount and the most important thing as compared to other things, I think there's still sort of an opportunity of flexibility even in light of the city auditor's findings that allow the city Council to exercise its discretion and determine how to allocate and whether to allocate certain types of revenue sources to certain types of needs in the instance of the city audit report, and the needs of bridge maintenance.",180,,
739,0.97,7232.892,7234.226,I wanted to address that really quickly.,180,,
740,0.97,7234.293,7244.704,"Third, I heard Councilmember Alex Pedersen mentioned that this budget action is only about $3.6 million and it's just for 2021.",180,,
741,0.97,7244.77,7263.089,"I want to be clear that that is not actually what this bill does, this is $3.6 million not just for 2021 but for every year after that, it would allocate $3.6 million at a minimum for every year after the passage of this bill.",180,,
742,0.97,7263.155,7284.21,"In addition, it's my belief and understanding that the sponsors intended to capture not just the $3.6 million, but the full $7.2 million and that belief is based on the following quote that comes from the press release that was issued by the sponsors.",180,,
743,0.97,7284.276,7320.179,"Which reads, ""the legislation would read an additional $3.6 million in 2021 and an additional $7.2 million in subsequent years, the Councilmembers propose to direct the additional funding to bridges with High-Frequency public transit ."" so it is my belief that the intent behind this bill is to capture every dollar generated from the vehicle license fee in both 2021 and in the years for bridge maintenance, and I have the intent in black and white right in front of me.",180,,
744,0.97,7320.246,7322.281,So that is the third point I wanted to make.,180,,
745,0.97,7322.348,7362.154,"The fourth issue I wanted to address is the issue that bridges are only for single occupancy vehicles, I of course don't believe that is a true principal . We are a city that is surrounded by water and it has water dispersed throughout our city and I myself, personally understand the impact of the West Seattle bridge in particular as a huge need for maintenance and for repair and potential replacement.",180,,
746,0.97,7362.221,7378.504,"So, I don't want it to go unsaid jet that somehow I believe that bridges are only for single occupancy vehicle, that is not true at all.",180,,
747,0.97,7378.571,7388.948,"So I agree with the proponents of the original counsel bill, who feel strongly that bridges are in fact part of our transportation network.",180,,
748,0.97,7389.014,7408.067,"Lastly, chair, I will end with the questions related to the length of the Stakeholder process as originally proposed in my substitute bill, it is a six month, technically a Five- month Stakeholder process with a six month passage of a spending plan.",180,,
749,0.97,7408.134,7417.309,I am happy to make a verbal amendment now to modify that sticker process to three months.,180,,
750,0.97,7417.376,7449.875,"Likewise, if that is not consistent with the procedure set out by the chair and with counsel central staff expectations and preferences, I would give my word to the Councilmembers and stay here publicly that I would intend to bring an amendment forward for consideration on Monday to amend the substitute to have a three month Stakeholder process rather than a five-month Stakeholder process.",180,,
751,0.97,7449.942,7458.984,I'm happy to do that in any way that you all feel would be Procedurally appropriate.,180,,
752,0.97,7459.051,7467.86,"Thank you for that, now is a perfect time to make a verbal amendment, so we can move onto the next one, if that is your intent.",181,,
753,0.97,7467.927,7469.328,I would love to do that now.,181,,
754,0.97,7469.395,7495.12,"Just as we have the ability to do that between Allie and Calvin, I would also note on the fourth item that you mentioned guarding bridges being cross centric, I believe that was a reference something I had said in the last two weeks, so I just owned it and I corrected my statement as I want to make sure folks know we understand transit, pedestrian, bikes, all sorts of Multimodal options rely on bridges as well.",181,,
755,0.97,7495.187,7500.259,Thank you for calling that out and I'm happy to have my statement corrected.,181,,
756,0.97,7500.326,7517.81,"Just before we go on to additional comments, I want to make sure that Allie and Calvin have what they need to receive a verbal amendment to change 6 to 3.",181,,
757,0.97,7517.877,7526.852,"I believe so, change Sdot's agreement to people first, and have a counsel approve this spending plan a",182,,
758,0.97,7526.919,7531.19,& GT; yes.,183,,
759,0.97,7531.257,7535.06,"Yes, I think that correct.",184,,
760,0.97,7535.127,7538.364,Thank you.,185,,
761,0.97,7538.43,7548.107,"Before we take officially, Councilmember Lisa Herbold, I see your hand up.",186,,
762,0.97,7548.173,7560.786,"I want to say the record, one my correction for the record regarding whether or not bridges are cross centric, we are not directed to either Council chair Teresa Mosqueda nor counsel President M.",187,,
763,0.97,7556.815,7576.802,"Lorena Gonzalez, it was in response to things I heard in public comment today and I want to clarify, the legislative intent in the bill, counsel bill itself, it does not allocate funding to bridges in Perpetuity.",187,,
764,0.97,7576.869,7601.16,"The action as it relates specifically to the Council budget action, it relates to 2021 and that is the action, as I understand it, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that is the action that expresses our intent for one year.",187,,
765,0.97,7601.226,7607.967,Because I have been saying I'm willing to Revisit the issue of the other 3.6 million in future,187,,
766,0.97,7608.033,7626.986,"Just speak legislation itself, the legislation authorizes the expenditure for any eligible transportation purpose, so the revenue stream is not obliged, the Council budget action would direct 2021 revenues toward bridge maintenance, and it does",188,,
767,0.97,7627.052,7631.39,& GT; thank you so much.,189,,
768,0.97,7631.457,7640.532,Council in front of us your substitute Blg 042 B 001.,190,,

773,0.97,7693.485,7695.454,Thank you.,194,,
774,0.97,7695.521,7702.561,Because I need a bridge to get into town.,194,,

776,0.97,7706.198,7716.341,"I do, Councilmember Alex Pedersen, did you have a comment?",196,,
777,0.97,7716.408,7721.547,"Yes, I just wanted, amendment as I understand, it is on or before, so a faster process could take place?",197,,
778,0.97,7721.613,7721.747,Okay.,197,,
779,0.97,7721.814,7725.851,Because that is I think five months from today.,197,,
780,0.97,7725.918,7729.421,That's when it would be enacted.,197,,
781,0.97,7729.488,7734.259,"So if something happened faster, it is on or before, so thank you for clarifying.",197,,
782,0.97,7734.326,7738.03,"Excellent, any clarifying questions or comments?",198,,
783,0.97,7738.097,7744.436,"Okay, Councilmember Lisa Herbold?",198,,
784,0.97,7744.503,7746.071,Do we have a motion second already?,199,,
785,0.97,7746.138,7749.441,"Yes, thank you so",200,,
786,0.97,7749.508,7768.961,"I want to not about the length of the process, my concern is about opening up this revenue source to other uses other than bridge maintenance, I think one way for us all to show how much we care about ridge maintenance is not introducing the process that might, conceivably could result in no money for bridge maintenance.",201,,
787,0.97,7769.027,7772.064,So thank you.,201,,
788,0.97,7772.131,7796.221,"So, the item is amend the proposed substitute, and that way we will have the accurate reflected substitute in front of us and then colleagues, I'm going to call through the or not you want to include this substitute and we would vote on a substitute, so there's three votes.",202,,
789,0.97,7796.288,7798.323,"And I'm seeing nods from central staff, that's always helpful.",202,,

807,0.97,8001.76,8003.595,"Okay, it has been moved and Seconded.",207,,
808,0.97,8003.662,8016.942,"Councilmember Kshama Sawant, you are recognized to describe your amendment to the amendment substitute.",207,,
809,0.97,8017.008,8046.605,"Thank you, as I earlier, this substitution does not change the spending plans and procedures in any way, and to be clear, that means that I would also accept the same verbal amendment to make the Stakeholder process three months instead of five months, as just adopted in 42 B 1, but it changes in this amendment, where the money comes from, increasing taxes on business instead of taxes on working people.",208,,
810,0.97,8046.671,8078.236,"Seattle in particular has had one of the most progressive tax systems in the nation, with poor and working-class people paying a higher portion of their paycheck than the rich, Council members often amend the taxes but it took a grassroots mass movement, movement leadership independent of the establishment and 30,000 signatures for the threat of a viable ballot initiative to ultimately force big business and the political establishment to concede on the tax.",208,,
811,0.97,8078.303,8087.712,"In this case, the city Council has a very clear choice between a progressive or progressive tax and I urge Council members to vote yes on this substitution for the progressive option.",208,,
812,0.97,8087.779,8119.478,"The vehicle license fee commonly known as car tab's is one of the most deeply and aggressive and punishing taxes on working people and because it is so deeply progressive, precisely because it is hated, correctly so by ordinary people, right-wing figures end up being able to tap into that anger, the genuine anger to adapt the essential transit funding.",208,,
813,0.97,8119.544,8121.746,"When I say car tab's are punishing, I mean that literally.",208,,
814,0.97,8121.813,8131.99,Poor people go to jail for this because of unpaid car tab's.,208,,
815,0.97,8132.057,8146.404,"If you cannot afford it, you can get a very expensive ticket, even if your car is just parked on the street and since people who have trouble affording Cartabs also do not have private driveways, that happens a lot.",208,,

817,0.97,8161.353,8189.047,"I wanted to relay, one of the staff members in my office who had to go to court for times when he was charged with a misdemeanor because of car tab's, eventually his charge was reduced to a traffic infraction after the fourth court date, but if you could imagine what a burden this place is on ordinary people, especially when many of them are holding two jobs, now many of them facing unemployment.",208,,
818,0.97,8189.114,8219.945,"In 2015, when I was arrested along some other activist for this $15 minimum wage struggle, while engaging in nonviolent action in Seatac to demand Airlines abide by the $15 minimum wage law, in my jail cell, virtually all of the 8 to 10 women in my cell were in jail because of traffic violations and expired Cartabs as the original reason was a common theme.",208,,
819,0.97,8220.011,8226.952,This is anecdotal but we have overwhelming statistical evidence of the consequences of taxes on working and poor people and on our society as a whole.,208,,

828,0.97,8336.461,8339.264,This budget amendment would add the following to the big business tax rates.,208,,

973,0.97,9614.771,9625.582,This is so important as our city and region has entered into an extremely troubling spike in the infection rates.,300,,

985,0.97,9756.746,9795.919,"So if you are intending this to go to something other than a Lehigh sponsored encampment, I think the language needs to be different . The tiny House camps here in West Seattle, they have their own rules and they have a process for enforcing those rules . and I think there is a difference of opinion of sort of scales of Self-Management that we have seen among different hosts of tiny House villages and tent Encampments.",306,,
986,0.97,9795.986,9809.633,"The intent is to not go to a Self-Management tiny House village that an organization like Lehigh is the fiscal sponsor for, then I think the language needs to be something different.",306,,
987,0.97,9809.699,9833.023,"I agree with you, I think Self- management is why we have such an evolved and sophisticated model that is working right now because of the history of city support for sanctions encampment, it is allowed for this evolution of a model that is providing outcomes.",306,,
988,0.97,9830.82,9897.053,"My question related to the fund source is, I see that the funds for this action come from specifically the funds associated with one of the items in the consent package and that is 139 5 E1, and includes specific funding in order to both relocate 425 additional people from unsafe conditions into safe lodging with either temporary hotels and enhanced shelters, and specifically identifying the 125 enhanced shelter builds as one additional strategy Complementing the sheltering.",306,,
989,0.97,9897.12,9901.591,The hotel strategy.,306,,
990,0.97,9901.658,9941.298,"So, we adopted this item earlier, the consent package, it is a very carefully negotiated dollars in order to result in a particular outcome and it has been negotiated with Stakeholders as well as the Mayor's office, we are trying to move forward together and really trying to set out on a new approach, rather than having a lot of conflict associated with how we address Unsanctioned Encampments.",306,,
991,0.97,9941.364,9954.277,"I'm concerned if we are going to be taking money away from this already negotiated integrated upon amount, that there's going to be trouble ahead.",306,,
992,0.97,9954.344,9961.918,"Yes, let's on that because I believe it is additive, this is not among those dollars, let's just double check, I see you both",307,,
993,0.97,9961.985,9966.556,I'm to answer the question.,308,,
994,0.97,9966.623,10007.597,"To the first question, my understanding is correct, that all of the sanctioned Encampments which we also call tiny home villages are self managed, and there's degrees to which that might be the case, that's why the language says a self managed in commitment, and this is where it departs from the model typically utilized by Lehigh, that are not operated by homeless agencies, I believe we would categorize groups like share as services agencies rather than maybe a more collaborative concept of self organization.",309,,
995,0.97,10007.664,10016.873,"So that is the intention between the CBA to not talk about agencies that are funded, especially Lehigh.",309,,
996,0.97,10013.57,10037.56,"And to your second question, you are correct, the Hom5B1 or 2 at this point, that refers to this framework about outreach and troubled populations and writing services to them and moving forward.",309,,
997,0.97,10037.627,10053.543,"That moves forward to 125 beds, that includes the 300 proposed by the Mayor using yesterday funds and hotels, and also the 125 bed enhanced shelter.",309,,
998,0.97,10053.61,10061.584,"The $250,000 that is leveraged here, just resulted from simple math.",309,,
999,0.97,10061.651,10070.393,"It cost a little bit less than $20,000 for an enhanced shelter bed to be operating for an entire year.",309,,
1000,0.97,10070.46,10079.469,"$20,000, and Multiply it by 125, it is just a little bit less than $2.5 million, yet the Mayor's proposed budget provided $2.75 million.",309,,
1001,0.97,10078.034,10097.72,"So there seems to be some padding in there, with the absence of a location or other reasons to believe, that could be reduced with out having an impact on the operation of 825 bed shelters.",309,,
1002,0.97,10097.787,10101.991,"Jeff, did you already comment?",310,,
1003,0.97,10102.058,10103.66,"The funding is additive, correct?",310,,
1004,0.97,10103.726,10112.535,It's not a slice of the other two homelessness efforts we have talked about being in tandem just before we went to,310,,
1005,0.97,10112.602,10129.652,"If you mean this is in addition to the other pieces that are being funded, so yes, all of these are operating separately . This is not taking $250,000 from either of those two CBA's.",311,,
1006,0.97,10129.719,10135.124,"From a different budget, they intersect because of topics.",311,,

1014,0.97,10176.099,10181.804,Maybe that's something we can look at later.,315,,
1015,0.97,10181.871,10188.711,"Thank you . Jeff, did have a response?",316,,
1016,0.97,10188.778,10206.062,"It acts as a they don't have the capability of managing a city contract, they don't meet all the qualifications and requirements, so we wouldn't technically call it an agency as much as a Subcontractor or somebody in partnership with the actual agency.",317,,
1017,0.97,10206.129,10209.065,Thank you.,318,,
1018,0.97,10209.132,10215.071,"Excellent, Kshama Sawant, would you like to close us out on this item?",319,,
1019,0.97,10215.138,10235.692,"Yes, thank you for questions and I really appreciate Jeff's thorough answers and I believe it's great, just to add to what he said, in terms of the question about Self-Management, I degree agree there are different degrees of Self-Management.",320,,
1020,0.97,10235.758,10257.513,"The question is not so much about that, the language in the amendment is not the deciding factor, the intent is for less villages, so basically covering both the villages and they Encampments, currently not funded because they did not check all of the ballot boxes.",320,,
1021,0.97,10257.58,10281.971,"So, that is the deciding factor in the language of the amendment, the action would support the operations of two Self-Management cabinets that are not operated by homelessness services, and potential investment and moving expenses and so on.",320,,

1056,0.97,10453.409,10457.547,I apologize.,348,,
1057,0.97,10457.613,10464.353,"Thank you so much, appreciate the opportunity for discussion on this one.",349,,
1058,0.97,10464.42,10492.114,"I just want to raise the fact that first of all, as required by the Council accountability ordinance passed in 2017, it reads in consultation the OPA, the CPC and the chair of the public safety Committee, they will work to the office of the inspector General will solicit Workplan suggestions.",349,,
1059,0.97,10492.181,10521.01,"Just recently, the Oig has written to solicit Workplan's suggestions from each CPC and myself, the process of looking at changes to the accountability structure authority and process to make improvements is charged to the office of the inspector general . So, it would be appropriate to request the office of the inspector general to research this issue.",349,,
1060,0.97,10521.077,10536.158,I would be happy to submit this Workplan suggestion on behalf of Councilmember Kshama Sawant for Oig consideration and inclusion of this issue on her 2021 Workplan.,349,,
1061,0.97,10536.225,10560.283,"As it relates to the statement of legislative intent as drafted, it commits central staff to working on a bill, we all have 2021 and 2022 priorities, legislative priorities that central staff has not been able to dedicate time to during 2020 because of Covid.",349,,
1062,0.97,10560.349,10575.264,"Summer budget, this budget, and I'm concerned that this budget proposal would assume Prioritization of counsel staff development of this legislation without any analysis at all first whether or not this is policy that is possible.",349,,
1063,0.97,10575.331,10581.037,I would not be adverse to counsel asking law to research the issue.,349,,
1064,0.97,10581.103,10585.574,I do not support having central staff work on the issue.,349,,
1065,0.97,10585.641,10607.096,"Secondly, as it relates to the comment and concern that this proposal assumes that the CPC is not fulfilling its charge as passed by the Council in 2017, when in fact the fulfillment of its charge has been blocked because of many of its proposals that haven't been implemented.",349,,
1066,0.97,10607.163,10617.406,Some of those proposals bend depend on bargaining and that also goes for recommendations from the OPA and the Oig.,349,,
1067,0.97,10617.473,10636.392,"One example of when the CPC was far ahead of policymakers, in the public, relates to recommendations it made in years prior specifically related to protest management.",349,,
1068,0.97,10636.459,10649.538,"The police Department made changes as a relates to crowd control, but not focused on protest management and enacting many of the recommendations that the CPC made.",349,,
1069,0.97,10649.605,10683.773,"Another example of the CPC being ahead of the general public and ahead of policymakers relates to the need to have the expertise of community members, expertise of community members with lived experiences interacting with the police Department that we should have them available as advisors to us on the Lrpc and they should be available for consultation with the labor relations negotiating team.",349,,
1070,0.97,10683.839,10697.787,This is something that we have now enacted in consultation with the executive.,349,,
1071,0.97,10692.882,10715.871,About this is an example of something that the CPC has been asking for for years and I feel very strongly that their effectiveness should not be measured by whether or not there recommendations have been implemented.,349,,
1072,0.97,10715.938,10739.295,"Secondly, I just want to highlight that the Council in January adopted resolution 31930, regarding the negotiations with the police officer skilled, the resolution included recommendations from the community police Commission, the inspector general in the office of police accountability and those recommendation are guiding us on the labor relations policy Committee in developing our bargaining agenda.",349,,
1073,0.97,10739.361,10771.727,"I'm concerned that as drafted, there's the potential that it would allow anyone to run for election including opponents of police reform and I'm concerned that if we approve this today, this could imply that counsel support this, and in any case, go through the consent process, which would need necessary approval of the three accountability bodies that could be a barrier of going through the consent process.",349,,
1074,0.97,10771.794,10795.684,"And we cannot underestimate, it sounds like this is a small thing but it is not a small thing, it would completely reinvent police accountability in Seattle and again, we have Accountabilities that are about to participate in a formal role in NEGOTIATES with police management, associations in the police officer skilled.",349,,
1075,0.97,10795.751,10810.833,I'm concerned that researching this issue at this time and working to develop legislation would really undercut them and undercut their ability to be partners to us in these negotiations.,349,,
1076,0.97,10810.9,10843.465,"At the meeting this morning, the Cochair Walden noted that the police accountability ordinance has not been fully Mplemented, this is an ordinance that was sponsored by Council President Gonzales under her leadership and in partnership with the CPC and Reverend Walden noted that the court has ordered the city to bring a methodology for police accountability and that has not yet been completed.",349,,
1077,0.97,10843.532,10850.639,She also Referenced some of the points I made as a relates to the consent decree and potential impacts on the CPC's role in negotiations.,349,,
1078,0.97,10850.706,10880.97,"So again, I would be open to a statement of legislation intent that only asks the permit to research this issue, or should the statement of legislative intent not be passed today, I would also be happy to submit on behalf of a request to the Oig for her consideration and determination whether or not it is an appropriate item for the",349,,
1079,0.97,10881.036,10886.508,Thank,350,,
1080,0.97,10886.575,10890.112,"I have Sawant, any comments?",351,,
1081,0.97,10890.179,10928.484,"Several points, have some questions, not clear on some of the things, but just on the last point, that Councilmember Lisa Herbold, I wanted to make sure I understood correctly, did you say that the amendment was amendment to just the city attorney's office was asked to do this research, staff would not be used, you would be okay with that?",352,,
1082,0.97,10928.55,10937.559,"I would be open to considering it, it is not something I would be willing to vote on today.",353,,
1083,0.97,10937.626,10938.193,Okay.,354,,
1084,0.97,10938.26,10956.445,"So just to clarify on that one point, that is where my office started, we had just been in the process of drafting it alongside central staff.",354,,
1085,0.97,10956.512,10964.219,"We suggested that we should have central staff, and I'm okay with it.",354,,
1086,0.97,10964.286,10997.519,"Either way, but I also wanted to be clear that in this amendment, we are not just talking about research, we want the office to draft the legislation for it . It does not seem like a small thing at all, it is not a small thing, it is completely reinventing police accountability and it is high time the city council did something about this.",354,,
1087,0.97,10997.586,11030.152,"I have spent years talking about black lives matter and police accountability and Reimagining everything, to actually deliver on something and this is what this amendment, this is what the intent is about, it's not about measuring the community police Commission, it is not a judgment on their role, it is really the people's budget movement and my office trying to do something on police accountability.",354,,
1088,0.97,11030.219,11046.034,"And this body that is being proposed for the research and the legislation development, it would replace the office of accountability, so there is no conflict there.",354,,
1089,0.97,11046.101,11127.85,"And Similarly, I agree that the effectiveness should not be whether or not the recommendations have been adopted but that is precisely why we are recommending that the research and the legislation development has been in relation to the elected community oversight board because in terms of those elected members, having to have a reelection, and right now, all the agencies are reporting to the Mayor's office, the city Council and the police, in other words, the intent is for this future office or board to be a defendant of the Mayor's office, the city council in the police Department and making that an elected board that is empowered to hold police accountable and they need to be empowered to have full oversight over the police to investigate, to discipline, to fire or higher, all of that, they need to have the power, to which right now this is a really murky process because the buck is being passed from one office to another.",354,,
1090,0.97,11127.916,11138.794,"The city has not delivered on its promises, 2 years ago a police contract was adopted by all city Councilmembers except for my noble, and there are many instances where the community's voice has been Úignored.",354,,
1091,0.97,11138.861,11193.282,"So I do not believe that having an elected policy is the policy, because it hasn't been, not just of the city but city after city where promises were made for a movement and the promises were betrayed, I don't believe that . But what I do think is that being an elected board for the exclusive purpose and mandate of bringing about police accountability will mean that they are going to be answerable to orders, they themselves will be under pressure and one issue, not where they do somewhat progressive things and run on those issues while actually letting people down on critical issues like police accountability, like all the people who have been killed by police and not one police officer being brought to justice.",354,,
1092,0.97,11193.348,11196.952,I think that is a substantive component of this.,354,,
1093,0.97,11197.019,11212.801,"And the office of professional accountability oversight, they are not led by sworn officers, but the reality is they are extensively tied to the structures where the police Department, and they are certainly not independent of the political establishment.",354,,
1094,0.97,11212.868,11252.107,"And this is very important for this discussion, which is that we are not going to be the first city to take some of these measures . one of the features of this past election, November election has been the remarkable number of cities that had ballot measures related to police accountability, I don't believe any of them says elected, but the one thing that all of those ballot measures try to get to was the question of actually delivering accountability and they are accomplish in them.",354,,
1095,0.97,11252.174,11258.647,"First, the measures will be tested in actual time, in terms of whether they deliver or not.",354,,
1096,0.97,11258.714,11289.578,"So I don't have a crystal ball on that, but it is a question of what the ballot measure says and just to give you an example, in San Diego, measure B changes, they had a civilian oversight from the Advisory board and police actresses and commissions on police practices, they have the power to subpoena witnesses and conduct investigations into police officer misconduct.",354,,
1097,0.97,11289.645,11315.971,"It's not elected, but it is mandated with power by this ballot measure, by the voter intent . and they are going to review complaints against officers and investigate all interactions, it would be independent of the Mayor and city's police Department, that is one example.",354,,
1098,0.97,11316.038,11340.862,"There are many other measures that are being passed, in Oakland, and San Francisco and other cities that I don't have time to get into . The point being, yes, this is absolutely necessary for us to do this, do something, the current model is not working . I really don't think anybody can make any honest claim, it's simply not working.",354,,
1099,0.97,11340.929,11362.818,"And again, I'm open to amendments which will bring in, I'm open to saying independent of the Mayor's office, city Council and the police Department, that's fine, I'm okay with having the city attorney's look at it, the office look at it.",354,,
1100,0.97,11362.884,11367.122,I'm okay with those changes if the Council numbers are open.,354,,
1101,0.97,11367.189,11378.967,"Okay, thank you, to turn it over to Council President who is next, and I appreciate you sticking in there, thank you.",355,,
1102,0.97,11379.034,11430.552,"Sorry, I will make quick because we are 11 minutes past our designated hour for adjournment . But I just wanted to come as Council member who has been the public safety chair for the last 4 years, and who was a prime sponsor of the 2017 police accountability ordinance, wanted to just signal my support for Councilmember Verble's argument in opposition to this particular item as included in the consent package, and I really want to encourage my colleagues to vote no on this particular item, for all of the reasons articulated by Councilmember Lisa Herbold.",356,,
1103,0.97,11430.619,11446.935,"I think there is a legitimate question and conversation that needs to occur about whether or not the 2017 version of the accountability system that we passed is still relevant today, I think that is a legitimate question to ask.",356,,
1104,0.97,11447.002,11454.81,What I'm concerned about is that it presupposes what the answer should be.,356,,
1105,0.97,11454.876,11492.08,"So I'm fine as supporting any efforts from policy perspective and I don't think a slide is required in order to have a body of work, she can do it with or without the slide but, I do think that the question should be broad from the policy perspective of saying, is the police accountability system that we designed and developed and adopted as a counsel unanimously in partnership with community, is that system still relevant in 2020?",356,,
1106,0.97,11492.147,11517.505,"And that is a different question than what is broken, fixed, or needs fixing, but my biggest concern is that it presupposes that the answer to that question is that yes it is broken and it is no longer relevant, and the answer as devised by me is to have this other radically different approach and system in place.",356,,
1107,0.97,11517.572,11559.214,"So, my preference would be to engage in true community outreach with the community partners, to comply with our consent decree obligations and to not shy away from the Overarching 30,000 foot question, as I just described it, but I think it would be premature to have this council as a whole signal it's support for the particular approach, described in and being advocated for in this particular budget action.",356,,
1108,0.97,11559.281,11567.856,So I will not be supporting this particular item as part of the consent package.,356,,
1109,0.97,11567.923,11584.005,"Thank you very President, thank you Councilmember Lisa Herbold as well for your description of the concerns here, and Kshama Sawant for your explanation.",357,,
1110,0.97,11584.072,11596.718,"I think this was a more robust conversation than I anticipated, we are 15 minutes over, I'm going to motion to recess because this is a two day meeting and I think this requires a little bit wrapping up, make sure we get done with this and Councilmember Trent eights item.",357,,
1111,0.97,11596.785,11603.692,& GT; do we have a motion in front of,358,,
1112,0.97,11603.758,11609.898,"We do, I still adjourn.",359,,
1113,0.97,11609.965,11616.237,If it is of I prefer that we vote on this item.,360,,
1114,0.97,11616.304,11623.411,"Okay, let's do this.",361,,
1115,0.97,11623.478,11624.646,I do want to respond.,362,,
1116,0.97,11624.713,11637.025,"I appreciate you all wanting to do this quickly but I will say, I have taken very little time off in this meeting, and I don't appreciate constantly being told to do that quickly.",362,,
1117,0.97,11637.092,11640.328,I'm doing it as quickly as possible.,362,,
1118,0.97,11640.395,11656.344,"Councilmember Gonzales said that this amendment presupposes that the current system is broken, yes, it absolutely is Premised on the overwhelming fact that the current system is absolutely broken.",362,,
1119,0.97,11656.411,11665.387,"And that is not my personal opinion as a Socialist, this is something that is being widely recognized by a vast majority of people.",362,,
1120,0.97,11665.453,11684.172,"My observation from having talked to hundreds of people about the demand to Defund the police is that many people who don't agree with Defunding the police actually strongly agree that yes, they need to be strong accountability system and the current system is simply not working.",362,,
1121,0.97,11684.239,11688.576,That is the reality that this amendment is Premised on.,362,,
1122,0.97,11688.643,11710.765,"And the language in the amendment is as I explained, in great detail, along the lines of many ballot measures and I also said I'm open to adjustments in that language if you want to make sure it is more consistent with some of the ballot measures that are already being passed by other cities.",362,,
1123,0.97,11710.832,11724.345,"Again, this is not my opinion, this is something that is being Reimagined by tens of thousands of people.",362,,
1124,0.97,11724.412,11766.888,"This is my opinion in my plan, and it'll be so terrible if the Council votes on this, if your opinion is that the current system is somehow working then that is your opinion and they will reflect that, but I want to make clear that this amendment is in no shape or form based on any personal opinions or biases that my office has, it is absolutely based on the fact on the ground that the current system is broken and we need something better and if Council members don't agree with this and this amendment loses the vote tonight, I would welcome other Councilmembers to give their alternatives to how they would Reimagine and actually accomplish police accountability.",362,,
1125,0.97,11766.955,11771.559,Thank you.,362,,
1126,0.97,11771.626,11779.934,"Okay, thank you so clarification is warranted, number one, I was not limiting anybody's time, the fact that I was willing to suspend this tomorrow offered additional time for discussion.",363,,
1127,0.97,11780.001,11810.031,"Number two, it is my understanding that I believe that this item was going to be a request to law to work on that drafting the research question and I think that the question about how we make this in tandem with the central stops work, wanting to recognize that central staff would be involved was part of what I suggested so I hope I did not complicate things in that way.",363,,
1128,0.97,11810.098,11831.953,"I think the intent to make sure that law has the opportunity to research this as any other counsel office would put as part of their work plan, it just was lifting up this item to make sure that if this was something that was going to be done, that we were explicit about the intent to make sure this was done in a way that was very transparent and in partnership with law and central staff and I'm supportive of it.",363,,
1129,0.97,11832.02,11851.739,"It does sound like it needs additional amendments and if it does not pass today, I think that would let sponsors work on this hopefully to make sure that this is a conversation that happens at law, it does not signal that at least from my perspective that this is not going to happen.",363,,
1130,0.97,11851.806,11856.444,I think it's a matter of the right placement for this and a Workplan and among our partnership with law.,363,,
1131,0.97,11856.511,11860.181,I don't see any additional comments or questions.,363,,
1132,0.97,11860.248,11861.616,There is no substitute.,363,,
