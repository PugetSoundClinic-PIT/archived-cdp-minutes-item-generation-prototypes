69,0.97,413.012,424.323,I move that we reconsider the motion to amend the proposed introduction and referral calendar as proposed by Councilmember Solan.,28,,
70,0.97,424.323,430.329,Would you like to say a little more about your intent for that reconsideration?,29,,
71,0.97,430.329,431.264,Yes.,30,,
72,0.97,431.264,440.139,"I would like to reconsider, for the purpose of referring it to a different committee.",30,,
73,0.97,440.139,440.406,Okay.,31,,
74,0.97,440.406,443.309,So it's been--there's a motion on the floor.,31,,
75,0.97,443.309,446.379,Is there a second for that motion?,31,,
76,0.97,446.379,446.679,Second.,32,,
77,0.97,446.679,457.623,It's been moved and Seconded to reconsider the motion to amend the introduction and referral calendar.,33,,
78,0.97,457.623,470.803,"So right now, what we have before us is a motion to reconsider the field motion, and Councilmember Morales has indicated that her intent here is to have it referred to as a different committee.",33,,
79,0.97,470.803,476.976,So all we're voting on right now is whether or not we should reconsider the motion.,33,,
80,0.97,476.976,481.08,So it's not a substantive vote yet.,33,,
81,0.97,481.08,483.783,On adding it to the introduction referral calendar.,33,,
82,0.97,483.783,494.861,It is a technical vote on whether or not we should reconsider the motion for amending the introduction referral calendar.,33,,
83,0.97,494.861,495.061,Okay.,33,,
84,0.97,495.061,499.732,Are there any comments on the motion to reconsider?,33,,
85,0.97,499.732,500.199,Councilmember Solan?,33,,
86,0.97,500.199,523.856,"At this point, I'm not fully clear on what the procedure is, but I would like to--if Councilmember Morales agrees, to have an actual motion that will say that we introduce the three pieces of legislation, and we forward them to a committee of the whole of the Council.",34,,
87,0.97,523.856,539.672,"Councilmember Solan, my understanding is that as a member of somebody who is not on the prevailing side of the previous motion, that motion cannot be brought forward by you, but Councilmember Morales has made a motion to reconsider.",35,,
88,0.97,539.672,561.694,"So in order to have a conversation at all about where this bill goes in terms of the committee, we have to be able go through the process of passing a motion to reconsider first, and then we will have a consideration about any amendments to your underlying motion?",35,,
89,0.97,561.694,562.361,Thank you.,36,,
90,0.97,562.361,568.234,Just a point of clarification that would help me.,36,,
91,0.97,568.234,576.943,The motion to reconsider does not include the name of the committee that the motion to reconsider recommends the legislation to be referred to.,36,,
92,0.97,594.46,596.729,My understanding is that would be a secondary motion.,36,,
93,0.97,596.729,598.764,It would be to amend the failed motion.,36,,
94,0.97,598.764,609.342,But we need to put the failed Moton back on the table in order to amend it by proposing a different committee.,36,,
95,0.97,609.342,614.547,Got it.,37,,
96,0.97,614.547,615.247,Thank you.,37,,
97,0.97,615.247,615.948,You're welcome.,38,,
98,0.97,615.948,616.148,Okay.,38,,
99,0.97,616.148,620.486,So any other questions or comments on the motion for reconsideration?,38,,
100,0.97,620.486,629.829,"Hearing none, will the clerk call the roll on the reconsideration of the--of the amendment?",38,,
101,0.97,629.829,637.236,Councilmember Louis?,39,,
102,0.97,637.236,640.539,Councilmember Louis?,39,,
103,0.97,640.539,641.907,No.,40,,
104,0.97,641.907,647.647,Councilmember Morales?,41,,
105,0.97,647.647,648.981,Aye.,42,,

115,0.97,670.503,672.071,Aye.,52,,
116,0.97,672.071,674.507,Councilmember Juarez?,53,,

118,0.97,675.908,679.211,Councilmember Gonzales?,55,,
119,0.97,679.211,679.478,Aye.,56,,
120,0.97,679.478,680.98,"Each in favor, one opposed.",57,,
121,0.97,680.98,691.791,"The motion carries, and the amendment to introduce these Council bills and refer them to the Sustainability Committee is before the Council for discussion now.",58,,
122,0.97,691.791,704.103,"Councilmember Morales, I'm going to call on you for door any amended language as you indicated originally.",58,,
123,0.97,704.103,704.403,Right.,59,,
124,0.97,704.403,713.345,I would like to move to amend the motion by amending the committee referral from Sustainability Renters' rights to the select budget committee.,59,,
125,0.97,713.345,714.013,Second.,60,,
126,0.97,714.013,722.321,It's been moved and Seconded to amend the motion to refer these three bills to the select budget committee.,61,,
127,0.97,722.321,729.462,"Councilmember Morales, as a sponsor of the amendment, would you like to address it first?",61,,
128,0.97,729.462,729.962,Sure.,62,,
129,0.97,729.962,730.563,Thank you.,62,,
130,0.97,730.563,749.148,"Council, colleagues, I do think that if this bill is not going to be heard in a committee that is chaired by Councilmember Solant, then I agree that a select budget--committee of the whole on which we both sit and on which we can both participate and vote is an appropriate alternative.",62,,
131,0.97,749.148,755.554,We all know that Seattle has the most progressive tax structure in the country.,62,,
132,0.97,755.554,776.809,"A family with $25,000 a year in income faces a tax rate 4 times higher than a family making a quarter million dollars, and what this means for us, particularly in my district is, because of the history of segregation in our city, a family in Rainier Beach pays a tax rate that's 4 times higher than a family in Laurel Hurst.",62,,
133,0.97,776.809,792.158,And so the bills that Councilmember Solant and I are proposing are critical to addressing both the current economic emergency that is developing in our city and the underlying emergency we have in this city.,62,,
134,0.97,792.158,811.877,I do want to say that I was elected to act with urgency to address the needs of the black and Brown families and community members in district 2 who bear the highest burden of our tax structure right now.,62,,
135,0.97,811.877,817.449,"When my constituents elected me, they rejected a scarcity mentality at the ballot box.",62,,
136,0.97,817.449,825.224,"And my constituents and your constituents know that our tax structure has created an unjust system, and big business knows it, too.",62,,
137,0.97,825.224,831.697,That's why they backed a measure at the state level to allow for a tax to fund housing and homelessness programs.,62,,
138,0.97,831.697,842.374,"So we have to fix our broken system so that it creates more egg Quitable way to finance services, and working families can't continue to foot the bill.",62,,
139,0.97,842.374,859.558,So I believe that these bills help create a new system that's designed very intentionally to reduce the disparities in our city.,62,,
140,0.97,863.529,866.899,To find a way to more equally fund government.,62,,
141,0.97,866.899,871.937,We know it's going to take our collective effort to move toward a radically new vision for our city.,62,,
142,0.97,871.937,889.722,"We've had a homelessness emergency and a housing shortage in this city for years, and now we are staring down the barrel of an unprecedented unemployment crisis that will leave many Seattle families with no income, no food, and no ability to pay for food.",62,,
143,0.97,889.722,905.638,"So the legislation that we're sponsoring would tax the biggest 2% of Seattle businesses, those with annual payrolls in excess of $7 million.",62,,
144,0.97,905.638,940.272,"It would direct the first 200 million to fund cash assistance for up to about 100,000 households, including those who were recently laid off, low-income families, people experiencing homelessness, Undocumented folks, and then, starting in 2021, would fund the construction of new social housing as well as operating support for permanent supportive housing, and it would also fund green new deal investments to be determined by the green new deal oversight board that we will seat this year.",62,,
145,0.97,940.272,955.554,So my hope is that we can get moving on this very important package of bills so that we can serve our communities and address the inequity that is inherent in our existing tax structure.,62,,
146,0.97,955.554,965.798,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales, for those introductory remarks on the amendment and on the substance of the bills.",63,,
147,0.97,965.798,987.252,"So we are now going to hear any other comments that other Council members might have, again, on the amendment to refer these bills to the select budget committee, which is the motion that is before us now, is a motion to amend the introduction referral calendar to refer the bills to the select budget committee.",63,,
148,0.97,987.252,987.953,Are there any other comments?,63,,
149,0.97,987.953,993.993,I would like to speak as the cosponsor and one of the two prime sponsors of the bills.,64,,
150,0.97,993.993,994.259,Okay.,65,,
151,0.97,994.259,1002.034,"So we have Councilmember Solan, and I saw Councilmember Herbl's hand go up.",65,,
152,0.97,1002.034,1003.035,The floor is yours.,65,,
153,0.97,1003.035,1032.664,"These three different pieces of legislation constitute the legislation that Councilmember Morales and I are sponsoring to tax Amazon and other big businesses in our city to provide emergency Covid-19 relief to Working- class Seattleites immediately, and to fund a public jobs program in subsequent years, building affordable housing, and for a green new deal to help workers recover from the economic impact which we are about to see off Covid-19.",66,,
154,0.97,1032.664,1058.257,"In this Coronavirus emergency, elected officials have a duty to act immediately and boldly to support the desperate needs of Working- class people created by the crisis, especially the context where big banks, corporate landlords, and big corporations as a whole are still making money while the vast majority of the working class is facing the brunt of the crisis.",66,,
155,0.97,1058.257,1079.278,"This legislation will fund basic life support in this year, 2020, by providing $500 a month stimulus checks to workers, including gig economy workers, like Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers, who are outrageously classified as independent contractors, and whose livelihoods are impacted by the social distancing needed to control the spread of the Coronavirus.",66,,
156,0.97,1079.278,1099.531,"And then, starting in 2021 and subsequent years, it will fund a massive expansion of permanently affordable, Rent-Controlled social housing, which is going to be very important, given that corporate landlords Arend now increasing rent of their tenants and agreeing to a new deal.",66,,
157,0.97,1099.531,1112.644,"This work of building rent affordable homes will be a major public jobs program as well, which will be a Good-Paying jobs, which will be needed when we go into the months ahead.",66,,
158,0.97,1112.644,1169.668,"The working-class stimulus will be funded, as we mentioned, by a corporate payroll tax on Amazon and the largest businesses in the city, not on small and medium-sized businesses, and it will raise $500 million per year, 200 million for the remainder of this year, and the largest businesses like Amazon have profited off the suffering by this or been bailed out by the Federal Government, and this tax would represent a tiny Sliver of that revenue that is going into the pockets of the major executives, the Billionaires and the shareholder . Even if we pass this as a whole without watering down, that is why I support Sanders' proposal to provide workers ongoing stimulus checks.",66,,
159,0.97,1169.668,1180.078,"This legislation was produced by our offices in collection with the grassroots tax Amazon movement, which my office has been a part of for now three years.",66,,
160,0.97,1180.078,1186.285,"So hundreds--in fact, maybe even thousands of people have participated in rallies and action conferences.",66,,
161,0.97,1186.285,1193.325,"By now, Over5,500 Seattleites have signed our petition, urging the Council to support this legislation.",66,,
162,0.97,1193.325,1205.737,"This morning, I forwarded you, all Councilmembers, Pretechnician responses, including 370 pages of comments from your constituents, and I hope that you and your staff will take the time to read them.",66,,

197,0.97,1520.418,1534.566,"Mad up President, I think it's been very clear from the committee meetings that I've chaired over the last two years, that I intend to have a robust discussion, one that involves staples across the city, and one that makes sure all Councilmembers have a chance to participate in the discussion.",70,,
198,0.97,1534.566,1537.035,That's the way that I've held Council meet information the past.,70,,

202,0.97,1566.364,1579.411,I would like to speak Council President.,71,,
203,0.97,1579.411,1584.416,I have a Bird'S-Eye view of a few other folks who have raised their hands.,72,,
204,0.97,1584.416,1595.293,"Evening to it's procedural issue that's technical, the issue before us now is which committee is going to hear it, not the substance of the bill or the policy issue.",72,,
205,0.97,1595.293,1598.93,So--but I do want to give an opportunity for those who raised their hands to speak.,72,,
206,0.97,1598.93,1607.005,"So I'm going to call on Councilmember Louis who is next, and then Councilmember Solant will have her--her last shot here.",72,,

208,0.97,1608.606,1612.243,"Thank you, Madam President.",73,,
209,0.97,1612.243,1612.644,I'll be brief.,73,,
210,0.97,1612.644,1642.173,"I mostly want to echo some of Councilmember--from the fall, before I became a mobile, Councilmember Gonzales, just around the new sort of a structure that the U.S. Council President were intending to impose in terms of having the smaller committees with--with smaller membership and really drilling down to issues at a committee level.",73,,
211,0.97,1642.173,1648.413,It's part of the reason.,73,,
212,0.97,1648.413,1650.615,It goes against the motion to reconsider.,73,,
213,0.97,1650.615,1665.196,"Part of the reason is just Procedurally, I do think, to echo Councilmember Herbold's points, things are going to come up where our stuff is going to come up with our committees.",73,,
214,0.97,1665.196,1676.041,"You know, some of the things that might come out, for example, of the auditing resolution we're going to vote on later today are going to Councilmember Gonzales's committee if there is legislation of which I am not a member.",73,,
215,0.97,1676.041,1685.583,"But I mean, that's the system that I agreed to in January when I voted and put it on the chairs.",73,,
216,0.97,1685.583,1691.523,I do intend to vote for Councilmember Morales's motion.,73,,
217,0.97,1691.523,1702.367,I do think this is a fair compromise to send this to the budget committee given the implications of the important legislation that swan and Councilmember Morales have brought forward.,73,,
218,0.97,1702.367,1728.126,"But I do think that generally, keeping things within the committee structure, Madam President, that you have laid out and we have voted on in January is something that, I think, as an institution will be good for the Council, and I just wanted to put that out there early, since this is our first of what will probably will be many conversations on this topic, and just wanted to throw that out.",73,,
219,0.97,1728.126,1731.463,"Thank you, Councilmember Louis, for those comments.",74,,
220,0.97,1731.463,1741.606,"We have Councilmember Solant is next, and then I have Councilmember Juarez, and I have now just seen Councilmember Peterson raise his hand as well.",74,,
221,0.97,1741.606,1745.11,"So Councilmember Solant, the floor is yours.",74,,
222,0.97,1745.11,1747.278,"Thank you, president Gonzales.",75,,
223,0.97,1747.278,1766.264,"I just wanted to clarify once again, as I have done many times before, that yes, the legislation often condition go into a committee that is chaired by a Councilmember that is not the sponsor of the legislation, and that happens often to my own legislation.",75,,
224,0.97,1766.264,1777.008,"Councilmember Louis will remember that in January, my legislation to expand ability to build houses throughout the city went through the select committee chaired by him, which was fine by me.",75,,
225,0.97,1777.008,1785.717,"Our movement was strong enough to win it, and we won a really good vote without really watering down the legislation, which was really a sign of the strength of the movement.",75,,
226,0.97,1785.717,1838.77,"But I just wanted to say, in response to what Councilmember Herbold said, who said in the she bristles, that urging that the Council put this legislation in a committee chaired by me and Councilmember mores, those are us with the two with responsibility of the legislation, I would just remind community members who are watching this that the reason I've been insistent on this for this particular legislation--and as I said, I don't insist on this for every legislation that comes from my office--is precisely because many Councilmembers, including Councilmember Herbold herself, voted to Repool the Amazon tax that I had fought so hard for in 2018, and that was done by 7 to 9 Councilmembers to a Back- room deal with Amazon lobbyists and corporate Mayor Derk, N.",75,,
227,0.97,1838.77,1841.372,"Councilmember Herbold, you were part of that.",75,,
228,0.97,1841.372,1842.707,"Councilmember Morales, you were part of that.",75,,
229,0.97,1842.707,1853.051,"While I welcome your positive voice now, and I would be happy to work with you all, I think it is very clear why our movement was insistent that this time around, the contacts be heard in my committee.",75,,
230,0.97,1853.051,1854.719,But it's fine if it's not.,75,,
231,0.97,1854.719,1863.194,"We will continue building our movement, and we will make sure the movement holds all politicians to their words.",75,,
232,0.97,1863.194,1872.37,"I'm happy to be working with you all, look forward to working with Councilmember Muskata in the committee chaired by her.",75,,
233,0.97,1872.37,1878.943,"Most urgently, I will be looking forward to discussing--and my staff will be reaching out to your staff soon, to schedule a meeting as soon as possible.",75,,
234,0.97,1878.943,1886.017,"As of this moment, timing is of the urgency, because a big push for this bill is to provide Covid-19 relief.",75,,
235,0.97,1886.017,1903.434,"So you all have an historic opportunity to show that the Council is not divide by passing a unanimous bill that is very strong, and taxes--those that will have the most, so that the working people in our city can survive, and not repeal it.",75,,
236,0.97,1903.434,1904.035,Thank you.,75,,
237,0.97,1904.035,1910.842,"Council member Juarez is next, followed by Councilmember Peterson.",76,,
238,0.97,1910.842,1911.776,"Councilmember Juarez, the floor is yours.",76,,
239,0.97,1911.776,1913.144,"Thank you, Council President.",77,,
240,0.97,1913.144,1913.611,Can you hear me?,77,,
241,0.97,1913.611,1915.747,We can hear you.,78,,
242,0.97,1915.747,1916.581,Thank you.,79,,
243,0.97,1916.581,1932.297,I will not obviously speak to the substantive piece of what we're--what we are passing on today to amend the introduction referral calendar to have this piece--these pieces of legislation in Councilmember Muscata's committee.,79,,
244,0.97,1932.297,1934.932,But this is a general observation.,79,,
245,0.97,1934.932,1940.571,"It's what I showed this morning, and also supporting some of what Councilmember Herbold shared.",79,,
246,0.97,1940.571,1946.844,I do think Councilmember Solant and Morales for their tenacity in pushing this forward and their concerns.,79,,
247,0.97,1946.844,1954.152,But I want to share this from a perspective of what we are as a Seattle city council.,79,,
248,0.97,1954.152,1959.557,This type of politics in the midst of a legal pandemic to me is unacceptable and a waste of time.,79,,
249,0.97,1959.557,1968.499,"I don't think this is the time to promote any type of political movement, and I don't think anyone should be accused of trying to undercut a movement.",79,,
250,0.97,1968.499,1973.071,"Again, it's not the time to be divisive or Accusatoriry.",79,,
251,0.97,1973.071,1985.883,We've seen enough of that on the Federal level.,79,,
252,0.97,1985.883,1989.053,We are concerned about people's lives and their livelihood.,79,,
253,0.97,1989.053,1995.026,Never before in the history of this world have we experienced a crisis together in real-time.,79,,
254,0.97,1995.026,2001.199,"Not only has technology connected us in all kinds of events, it has connected our lives and liveliness.",79,,
255,0.97,2001.199,2007.572,"I am concerned we are going to get off track, and we are not going to focus on what we can do as a Seattle city council.",79,,
256,0.97,2007.572,2017.048,I don't want to find ourselves being Side-Tracked or going down a rabbit hole about who or didn't do what back in 2017 and Ú18.,79,,
257,0.97,2017.048,2024.455,I do believe that all of us are working hard with the tools that we have as elected city Councilmembers for the city of Seattle.,79,,
258,0.97,2024.455,2026.19,"Not just our district, obviously.",79,,
259,0.97,2026.19,2028.226,You probably think that's odd coming from me.,79,,
260,0.97,2028.226,2040.138,"So I want to support and move forward with this, and have it go to Councilmember M, Scata's committee, where every Councilmember has an opportunity and will have comment to pass or look at this type of legislation.",79,,
261,0.97,2040.138,2041.973,"So with that, I yield the floor.",79,,
262,0.97,2041.973,2043.374,"Thank you, Council President.",79,,
263,0.97,2043.374,2048.379,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez.",80,,
264,0.97,2048.379,2049.347,"Councilmember Peterson, you have the floor.",80,,
265,0.97,2049.347,2049.714,Thank you.,81,,
266,0.97,2049.714,2060.825,"I just want to say that I do support sending it to this committee of the whole, the budget committee, chaired by Councilmember Muscata, and I do hope it is a robust discussion.",81,,
267,0.97,2060.825,2070.902,"I think supporting sending it to that Committee, I just want to signal that does not mean that I support the legislation that was just put out on Friday afternoon.",81,,
268,0.97,2070.902,2074.705,So it's something that I'm still going through.,81,,
269,0.97,2074.705,2080.711,I am concerned about introducing a new tax at the time that we're going through this pan epidemic I can.,81,,
270,0.97,2080.711,2085.983,"There's a lot of uncertainty going into a recession, putting a tax on employers.",81,,
271,0.97,2085.983,2094.559,"I think it's going to bring up a lot of hearty questions that we're going to have to answer in the committee, and I look forward to answering those and digging deep on those.",81,,
272,0.97,2094.559,2094.859,Thank you.,81,,
273,0.97,2094.859,2097.328,"Thank you, Councilmember Peterson.",82,,
274,0.97,2097.328,2105.97,Is there anyone who hasn't had an opportunity to speak who would like to provide comment?,82,,
275,0.97,2105.97,2106.304,Okay.,82,,
276,0.97,2106.304,2119.15,"Seeing none, we now have a motion in front of us to consider an amendment to refer these bills to the select budget committee.",82,,
277,0.97,2119.15,2121.786,It has been duly Seconded.,82,,
278,0.97,2121.786,2129.494,"You know, I articulated this morning why I believe it should go to the select budget committee.",82,,
279,0.97,2129.494,2130.461,Certainly not going to Belabor those point.,82,,
280,0.97,2130.461,2134.866,I agree with many of the comments being made by my colleagues during today's full city council meeting.,82,,
281,0.97,2134.866,2158.256,"I think it's appropriate for this issue to be considered, not just by any committee of the whole, but by the committee who is responsible for shepherding through policy issues related to city finances, and these--this suite of legislation is, first and foremost, a suite of bills designed to generate revenue.",82,,
282,0.97,2158.256,2164.529,"I think it's important for us to have those conversations, in the full context of the entire city's budget.",82,,
283,0.97,2164.529,2178.109,"I have a lot of faith in the chair that we all collectively elected and appointed to serve as our budget chair, and that is Councilmember Muscata.",82,,
284,0.97,2178.109,2189.954,And I believe we will see in the this legislation could actually benefit from the great thinking of all of our Councilmembers who were elected in their own right across the city.,82,,
285,0.97,2189.954,2207.171,"And so like Councilmember Herbold, I would like to see us move toward a path and direction, where we can stand together in the face of what will be a very difficult period of time for everyone in the city of Seattle, particularly for working families across the city.",82,,
286,0.97,2207.171,2209.34,This conversation is a serious one.,82,,
287,0.97,2209.34,2234.231,"We are facing serious revenue deficits at the city of Seattle, and now is the time for us to come together to try to work together and collaborate in a way that inspires confidence in the ability of local governments to truly meet the needs of our constituents as opposed to drawing fabricated lines of division and separation amongst ourselves.",82,,
288,0.97,2234.231,2267.999,"So I'm hopeful we will Recommit ourselves to that endeavor and look forward to having ongoing conversations through and appropriate committee process of the budget committee to make sure that we are flagging and identifying of critical importance and getting the answers and the information that we need on this suite of legislation, and really want to thank again, like many of my colleagues have, thank Councilmembers Solant and Morales for their work thus far on the pieces of legislation.",82,,
289,0.97,2267.999,2275.64,I look forward to working with them and all of you on making sure that we do the right thing for our constituents.,82,,
290,0.97,2275.64,2289.553,"So with that being said, with OAR going to go ahead and conclude debate on this technical amendment, and I will ask that the clerk call the roll on the amendment.",82,,

403,0.97,2593.19,2597.127,We put it on hold for a little while.,170,,
404,0.97,2597.127,2618.949,"But having consulted with the city auditor and with the office of the inspector general, there was a lot of feeling from Stakeholders that there was capacity to move forward and do this work remotely, since it didn't really involve much field work or require people to meet in person, and the meetings could probably be come dated remotely.",170,,
405,0.97,2618.949,2649.413,"The idea behind the resolution is essentially to have a group of experts composed folks who have been practicing the auditing space, the office of the inspector general and the city auditor, both of whom report to us and perform the auditing function for the city of Seattle, as legislative officers and the legislative branch, not the legislative Department.",170,,

408,0.97,2709.106,2719.95,"And then, obviously, the it office of the city auditor, which has that same role essentially for every other Department in the city.",170,,

418,0.97,2807.538,2811.074,So that's essentially what the resolution does.,172,,
419,0.97,2811.074,2828.859,"It's pretty Bare-Bones, but part of my inspiration for it was via rental housing inspection, Stakeholder committee that I was appointed to by Nick Lacotta and city council back in 20011 or 2012.",172,,
420,0.97,2828.859,2843.24,And sort of the work that that group did to be sort of a Soundingboard to help inform Councilmember Lacott's office on the eventual rental housing inspection legislation that was passed by the Council.,172,,
421,0.97,2843.24,2846.076,So that's what--that's what we're getting at with the resolution.,172,,

425,0.97,2867.097,2885.415,"So before I suspend the rules, I'm just going to ask first if any of my colleagues have questions about the resolution that are directed to Council's central staff.",173,,
426,0.97,2885.415,2885.616,Okay.,173,,
427,0.97,2885.616,2898.028,I'm not seeing any of our colleagues expressing an interest in or a desire to get additional information from Lisa Kay.,173,,
428,0.97,2898.028,2909.907,"So we're--I don't think we need to go--unless you disagree, Councilmember Louis, I don't think we need to go through the process of having Lisa address the Council.",173,,
429,0.97,2909.907,2914.044,Do you have an objection to that?,173,,
430,0.97,2914.044,2919.616,"No, but--I just--I do want to thank Ms. Kay for calling in so we did have that option.",174,,

438,0.97,2936.133,2939.102,I wanted to thank Councilmember Louis for introducing this.,176,,
439,0.97,2939.102,2942.539,Anything that can give our city auditor a high profile is great.,176,,
440,0.97,2942.539,2951.415,We just talked about an audit they released last week that Councilmember Roscata had an issue about Seattle city light.,176,,

442,0.97,2963.16,2966.029,We're going to have a hole in our budget.,176,,
443,0.97,2966.029,2978.408,"The city auditor is well poised to find savings, and has done that in the past, and I hope this will make the office even more robust in finding savings, making the city government even more efficient.",176,,
444,0.97,2978.408,2982.779,"So I want to thank Councilmember Louis for that, you know.",176,,
445,0.97,2982.779,3001.331,"And those of us who are really familiar with the workings of Capitol Hill know that the Congress has the Congressional Budget office, the congressional research service, the General Accounting office, and so, by us having a stronger city auditor, it's going to be better for all of us.",176,,
446,0.97,3001.331,3004.935,So I just want to thank Councilmember Louis for introducing this.,176,,
447,0.97,3004.935,3014.444,"I did have a quick question, a clarifying question about one of the sections or subsections of the resolution.",176,,
448,0.97,3014.444,3033.43,"Section 1-a lists the members of the working group, and I just wanted to clarify, when it says--since we're talking about city government, we're talking about a representative of the labor Union, I'm hoping that would be a labor Union that is representing city employees, just so it's--there's more of a connection.",176,,
449,0.97,3033.43,3033.697,Yeah.,177,,
450,0.97,3033.697,3035.298,And I'm happy to speak to that.,177,,
451,0.97,3035.298,3042.372,"First, you know, I want to thank you for--for your comment on the resolution as a whole to answer the question.",177,,
452,0.97,3042.372,3063.527,"I do want to state, though, that it's really important to note that, while oftentimes, performance audits do lead to practices that are more efficient and do save money and, in fact, King County has saved over $200 million in the last three years, to performance auditing, auditing is first and foremost efficacy.",177,,
453,0.97,3063.527,3065.195,"You know, are our programs working?",177,,
454,0.97,3065.195,3069.032,Are they doing things that we as a Council want the programs to do?,177,,
455,0.97,3069.032,3083.28,"Oftentimes and not uncommonly, that actually leads to programs needing more money, or finding holes where more repairs are needed for a program to realize the full effect and impact.",177,,
456,0.97,3083.28,3100.864,"So a flag that--you know, while efficiency is something that tends to come as an ancillary benefit to an audit, efficacy, first and fore most, the primary goal--and it's the primary goal of what I hope would come out of this--this resolution.",177,,
457,0.97,3100.864,3112.075,"So I did just want to flag that to make it clear that efficiency and efficacy, while they sometimes go together, sometimes an audit comes back and says, ""We actually need more revenue.",177,,
458,0.97,3112.075,3127.991,"We need more money, because we're not""--""We don't have enough to make it work ."" to respond to the question, Yeah, my intent--and I discussed this extensively with Protech 17.",177,,
459,0.97,3127.991,3135.832,"My hope would be someone from pro Tech 17 would be the labor person who would serve on this, because they represent a lot of folks across different departments.",177,,
460,0.97,3135.832,3156.453,"I talk to Shawn Van Ike, and he's excited, and with the Council on this, and to really see some of the changes that Protech 17 has flagged over the years as places where the city could be more accountable and responsive and efficacious.",177,,
461,0.97,3156.453,3167.898,"So I appreciate that, Councilmember Peterson and I would hope that one of the bargaining units within the city would be in that position.",177,,

463,0.97,3170.233,3176.673,"Councilmember Louis, I have in my notes that you intended to make an amendment to this Council bill.",178,,

466,0.97,3182.412,3183.847,Thanks for flagging that.,179,,
467,0.97,3183.847,3200.497,"Here, I'm just going to look up the exact language of the amendment here just to make sure that I get the wording right.",179,,
468,0.97,3200.497,3206.67,And I believe it was circulated in advance.,179,,
