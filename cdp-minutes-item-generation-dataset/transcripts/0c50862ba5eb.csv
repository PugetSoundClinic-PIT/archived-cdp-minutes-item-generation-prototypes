73,0.97,437.804,441.841,Gig workers don't benefit from Seattle's minimum wage law.,14,,
74,0.97,441.841,448.948,There's no form on what gig workers are paid and the work is shifted from the companies to the workers.,14,,

94,0.97,543.409,583.849,"The influx of contractors before and during the pandemic have lowered pay and the availability of work because of market saturation allowing Apps to adjust the PAYOUTS and lower the offer wage by imposing tips on top and pay transparency, this will give the independent contractor more power to negotiate the pay, more power to decide which work to take, and more power to keep our most marginalized and vulnerable independent contractors provided for.",16,,
95,0.97,583.849,590.69,Work in Washington developed a policy with gig workers and addresses the largest problem contractors are Facting as a worker in Seattle.,16,,
96,0.97,590.69,594.76,I urge you to pass the worker Payup policy.,16,,
97,0.97,594.76,598.197,This would mean more money and more power in the hands of the worker.,16,,

125,0.97,686.819,693.959,"If the body engaged, they would have understood we don't feel safe with increased police presence.",21,,
126,0.97,693.959,699.799,We don't want police officers on horses patrolling the communities.,21,,
127,0.97,699.799,702.768,"If you engage, actively listen to community, please don't represent us.",21,,
128,0.97,702.768,708.841,I yield my time and thank you.,21,,

138,0.97,723.055,727.226,"Good morning, city council members and fellow callers.",23,,
139,0.97,727.226,729.095,I'm a gig worker in Seattle.,23,,
140,0.97,729.095,737.97,I work for Uber and Lyft and worked for tap rabbit and tackle and many others to keep things going.,23,,
141,0.97,737.97,742.975,"I am a black male here in the city, a native of the city.",23,,
142,0.97,742.975,744.61,Proud to call Seattle my home.,23,,
143,0.97,744.61,749.281,Sometimes I walk around and wonder what kind of culture are we becoming?,23,,
144,0.97,749.281,756.455,I have a philosophy of leaving things better than I found them and we're only as strong as our weakest link.,23,,
145,0.97,756.455,759.492,"And right now, Seattle has a lot of good things.",23,,
146,0.97,759.492,765.131,"There's a lot of effort, a lot of work going on that's really, really good work.",23,,
147,0.97,765.131,779.712,"I want to encourage the Councilmembers to continue that legacy, to continue that hard work, and continue to serve the population and the people in the city and the management of all of the people is no easy task.",23,,
148,0.97,779.712,781.147,But we have the ability.,23,,
149,0.97,781.147,782.148,I'm certain of it.,23,,
150,0.97,782.148,794.26,"If we could have a bare minimum of equal pay and become a leader if the nation like we have always done, innovation, big corporations, legislation, I think we're on the precipice.",23,,
151,0.97,794.26,795.794,We have it in us.,23,,
152,0.97,795.794,802.334,"I want to encourage you guys and thank you for your time, service, efforts, and encourage you to continue doing your work.",23,,

158,0.97,811.21,814.079,Up to you.,24,,

164,0.97,835.601,835.868,Sorry.,27,,
165,0.97,835.868,839.371,I was dropping the phone and hung up on you guys.,27,,
166,0.97,839.371,840.105,No worries.,28,,
167,0.97,840.105,841.106,Okay.,29,,
168,0.97,841.106,853.852,"This thing you're considering doing, the independent contractor thing, it is not helpful for gig workers who have contracts but not basic pay standards.",29,,
169,0.97,853.852,855.554,It's basically for the higher paid Freelancers.,29,,
170,0.97,855.554,864.063,I doubt the numbers are close to the tens of thousands of gig workers looking for relief from the pay standards.,29,,
171,0.97,864.063,868.0,We have been asking you to help them for over a year now.,29,,
172,0.97,868.0,878.811,"We appreciate the sick leave and extra pay policies you passed, but those were emergency measures that will disappear.",29,,
173,0.97,878.811,882.514,We need lasting policies to keep the gig workers in the city above water.,29,,
174,0.97,882.514,885.918,We can't without anymore.,29,,
175,0.97,885.918,891.657,We have been asking for a while.,29,,
176,0.97,891.657,893.893,The local economy is hemorrhaging.,29,,
177,0.97,893.893,898.898,"If gig workers were paid reasonably, that's tens of thousands of workers putting money in the economy.",29,,
178,0.97,898.898,901.767,We're not making enough to live on.,29,,
179,0.97,901.767,906.705,Many due to personal circumstances really need the flexible work that gig work provides.,29,,
180,0.97,906.705,911.41,But they're not getting enough to live on.,29,,
181,0.97,911.41,912.278,"Point in case, myself.",29,,
182,0.97,912.278,916.282,I'm speaking to you today from my tent.,29,,
183,0.97,916.282,917.049,I am homeless.,29,,
184,0.97,917.049,925.758,I am part of the policy of the race to the bottom that the Apps are doing is what pushed me out.,29,,
185,0.97,925.758,930.562,"And for me, immediately, what would help is that we raise the pay floor.",29,,
186,0.97,930.562,937.002,"We have got to have at least minimum wage, plus expenses with tips on top.",29,,
187,0.97,937.002,939.338,We need to protect our workers' flexibility.,29,,

375,0.97,1694.692,1696.428,"Adam, f.",55,,
376,0.97,1696.428,1710.008,"As a union or care Givers who have long been excluded from basic Loib protections, we understand how important it is to continue to expand labor standards and protections for workers.",55,,
377,0.97,1710.008,1721.486,The city Council has done great work on that with the workers and drivers and initial steps around sick days and hazard pay protections for delivery workers.,55,,
378,0.97,1721.486,1736.634,We're asking the Council to take the next step to expand city labor standards to cover the thousands of gig workers in Seattle who are providing delivery and other essential services but are paid less than the minimum wage.,55,,
379,0.97,1736.634,1743.741,"You know, we understand the value of transparency and clarity for independent contractors.",55,,
380,0.97,1743.741,1758.022,We believe the proposal doesn't go far enough and doesn't address the key issues that many drivers raised today and urge the Council to set a wage that ensures the gig workers minimum wage and expenses and other protections.,55,,
381,0.97,1758.022,1758.289,Thank you.,55,,
382,0.97,1758.289,1759.557,.,55,,
383,0.97,1759.557,1760.492,Excellent.,56,,
384,0.97,1760.492,1761.025,"Thank you very much, Adam.",56,,
385,0.97,1761.025,1763.528,And that wraps up all who are present.,56,,
386,0.97,1763.528,1776.841,"We didn't have a chance to hear from Chris, Nancy, or David who were listed as wanting to speak but not present.",56,,
387,0.97,1776.841,1779.677,That concludes the public comment.,56,,
388,0.97,1779.677,1781.079,First 20 minutes of every meeting.,56,,
389,0.97,1781.079,1784.716,Let's move on to items of business.,57,,
390,0.97,1784.716,1785.016,Item number one.,57,,
391,0.97,1785.316,1795.26,"Madame clerk, you may be on mute.",57,,
392,0.97,1795.26,1798.797,"Number one, presentation from cities on American rescue plan funding for briefing and discussion.",58,,
393,0.97,1798.93,1800.798,Thank you very much.,59,,
394,0.97,1800.798,1807.472,We are really excited about the panel that is in front of us today.,59,,
395,0.97,1807.472,1815.78,"I see our colleagues from across the country from cities like Austin, Denver, and Minneapolis.",59,,
396,0.97,1815.78,1817.248,Very excited to have.,59,,
397,0.97,1817.248,1821.853,"Hello, counsel member Robin Kniech from Denver.",59,,
398,0.97,1821.853,1827.258,I see Lisa Bender from Minneapolis city council.,59,,
399,0.97,1827.258,1832.564,And Vanessa Fuentes from the Austin city council joining momentarily.,59,,
400,0.97,1832.564,1836.701,This is an amazing opportunity to see friends from afar.,59,,
401,0.97,1836.701,1854.185,"We haven't had the chance to get together, but we have been touching base frequently to understand what's going on in other jurisdictions as we have been respond to go the crisis that Covid exposed on the harm on the economy and hardest working workers and small businesses.",59,,
402,0.97,1854.185,1867.265,Today is a great opportunity to hear from other cities and peers about what they have been doing in the process they're engaged in now as they look at the Arpa funds allocated to local jurisdictions.,59,,
403,0.97,1867.265,1877.909,"Before the panel presentation, I want to ask Aly Pennucci to give an orientation to how this is the first kickoff to the conversations we will have soon.",59,,
404,0.97,1877.909,1882.313,Just briefly walk us through the time line we're talking about here.,59,,
405,0.97,1882.313,1882.747,That would be wonderful.,59,,
406,0.97,1883.047,1886.818,.,59,,
407,0.97,1890.388,1891.489,Thank you.,60,,
408,0.97,1891.489,1894.192,"Good morning, Councilmembers and guests.",60,,
409,0.97,1894.192,1897.195,I am going to briefly share my screen.,60,,
410,0.97,1897.195,1902.433,And what I am sharing here is the Finance and housing Committee's web page.,60,,
411,0.97,1902.433,1904.535,Can you see that okay?,60,,
412,0.97,1904.535,1905.27,Yep.,61,,
413,0.97,1905.27,1905.536,Great.,62,,
414,0.97,1905.536,1918.416,So the Finance and housing Committee's web page includes a high level summary of the general schedule and plan for the committee's consideration of Federal Covid relief funds.,62,,
415,0.97,1918.416,1929.594,"And so as the chair described briefly in the opening remarks earlier, this is the first sort of meeting following up on preliminary discussions in the last two committee meetings.",62,,
416,0.97,1929.594,1940.204,"Today, we will start with hearing from other cities about what they were thinking in terms of their use of the Arpa direct aid.",62,,
417,0.97,1940.204,1944.575,And that will be followed by a community panel at the next committee meeting.,62,,
418,0.97,1944.575,1948.146,And we will begin discussions of the first appropriation bill.,62,,
419,0.97,1948.146,1963.594,"Right now, we are looking at at least two appropriation bills for consideration of use of the 2021 direct aid expected from the American rescue plan, as well as some of the remaining Crf funds from 2020, which is about $18 million.",62,,
420,0.97,1963.594,1970.034,"Following that, there will be a public hearing, an opportunity to hear from the community about their priorities.",62,,
421,0.97,1970.034,1976.974,And then we'll continue the discussion on the first ordinance and Ideally be voted that out as early as may 5th.,62,,
422,0.97,1976.974,1979.877,And then moving into the discussions of the next bills.,62,,
423,0.97,1979.877,1998.162,"Throughout the conversations, what we will try to do is describe what is in the bill before the committee at that time, as well as starting to outline what the broader plans are as that might inform decisions about what you want to do in the first bill or the second bill.",62,,
424,0.97,1998.162,2010.475,So the overall plan is to take up those two bills in committee and have decisions made and appropriation bills adopted by June for the entirety of the funds.,62,,
425,0.97,2010.475,2018.649,Although discussions may be ongoing through the summer as we learn more about targeted aid and other opportunities to support the community.,62,,
426,0.97,2018.783,2021.519,Wonderful.,63,,
427,0.97,2021.519,2021.986,Thank you very much.,63,,
428,0.97,2021.986,2033.531,"And just to Orient us about the expectation here in Seattle, colleagues, we have about $239 million of direct aid that will be allocated.",63,,
429,0.97,2033.531,2041.339,Just over Half/Of that is the first we are talking about related to ordinance one and two here.,63,,
430,0.97,2041.339,2055.92,The pandemic induced revenue losses that we saw in 2021 and assumed in 20--that we saw in 2020 and assumed in 2021 are also the issues that we are able to address with the dollars in front of us.,63,,
431,0.97,2055.92,2064.429,"We will have approximately $130 million deficit in the general fund revenues, which excludes our jump start payroll tax.",63,,
432,0.97,2064.429,2077.642,"There is a huge need to support the basic expenditures as we look at recovering from the crisis, economic revenue forecast will give us a clear picture of what to anticipate in the out years.",63,,
433,0.97,2077.642,2107.972,"And we are very excited to initiate the conversation today by hearing from leaders across our country, local leaders, leaders in their own jurisdictions and on counsels across the country fighting against the inequities exposed by Covid and before Covid, trying to figure housing stability, Workerer protections, and access for small businesses to open.",63,,
434,0.97,2107.972,2119.183,So thank you to the local progress and their work in figuring out how to weave together the National conversation amongst cities and jurisdictions.,63,,
435,0.97,2119.183,2126.123,We have put out information in terms of how cities are looking to provide equitable relief and connecting cities.,63,,
436,0.97,2126.123,2144.509,"And local progress is going to continue to make sure we're connecting leaders across the country, not only as we respond to the crisis that is Covid, but in the longer term as we think about the equitable recovery, investments in public goods and services, and look forward to sharing that initial analysis with you.",63,,
437,0.97,2144.509,2145.71,It's posted on our web page.,63,,
438,0.97,2145.71,2157.121,And we will share it in the Federal advocacy page pushing out on the social Medias as well.,63,,
439,0.97,2157.121,2167.331,"Today, we have Councilmember Robin Kniech, from Denver, Colorado, who championed causes for working families from housing, food, minimum wage.",63,,
440,0.97,2167.331,2170.601,Thank you very much for being with us.,63,,
441,0.97,2170.601,2173.137,And we have Councilmember Fuentes.,63,,
442,0.97,2173.137,2174.872,I see you on the line.,63,,
443,0.97,2174.872,2187.685,"Good to see you and excited to have you from Austin, Texas, a long time champion of health care as a human right and fighting for affordable housing and policy solutions.",63,,
444,0.97,2187.685,2197.562,She sits on the county's hate crimes task force and has already in her short term on Council made her mark in supporting residents.,63,,
445,0.97,2197.562,2204.368,"And finally, Lisa Bender, huge leader within local progress and Council president for the Minneapolis city council.",63,,
446,0.97,2204.368,2213.711,"We have looked to you for many issues, especially related to public safety and housing and zoning.",63,,
447,0.97,2213.711,2231.929,"Appreciate your tenure on Council and looking forward to hearing from you today as we engage on how to expand on the things you champion, including the transit mobility, fighting for green, equitable economies and green new deal, like investments in our local jurisdictions.",63,,
448,0.97,2231.929,2235.233,Incredibly happy to have all of you with us today.,63,,
449,0.97,2235.233,2248.613,And I am without further Ado turn it over to you all to share with us the work that you are doing to get out the allocation from Arpa.,63,,
450,0.97,2248.613,2257.188,"And we have not only the Finance and housing committees, but we have extended the invitation to the full city council.",63,,
451,0.97,2257.188,2263.561,So we have guests not usually part of the committee to hear from you and look forward to learning from you.,63,,
452,0.97,2263.561,2266.097,"Council President Bender, perhaps we should start with you.",63,,
453,0.97,2266.097,2270.268,Thank you for your work on bike lanes and expansion on zones and housing.,63,,
454,0.97,2270.268,2277.742,That helps to create the foundation for equitable economies by looking at what's happened in the wake of Covid.,63,,
455,0.97,2277.742,2283.381,How is your city council looking to allocate the funds you received?,63,,
456,0.97,2283.381,2285.383,"And any grains of knowledge, we appreciate.",63,,
457,0.97,2285.383,2285.516,.,63,,
458,0.97,2285.516,2285.816,Perfect.,64,,
459,0.97,2285.816,2288.152,Thank you so much for having us today.,64,,
460,0.97,2288.152,2290.454,"I think, you know, I love this idea.",64,,
461,0.97,2290.454,2296.927,Maybe I'll see if the group can come to Minneapolis as well.,64,,
462,0.97,2296.927,2301.432,We are probably the smallest city in the group.,64,,
463,0.97,2301.432,2302.199,"We have 430,000.",64,,
464,0.97,2302.199,2306.504,That meant that we did not receive direct cares act funds in the C.A.R.E.S.,64,,
465,0.97,2306.504,2306.671,Act.,64,,
466,0.97,2306.671,2317.281,So we relied on a partnership with our County to program the funds that they directly received.,64,,
467,0.97,2317.281,2319.05,They did meet the population threshold.,64,,
468,0.97,2319.05,2330.795,"And eventually, our state, we have one of the only--I think the only guided political houses in the Legislature.",64,,
469,0.97,2330.795,2336.0,There's a lot of grid lock at the state between the political parties.,64,,
470,0.97,2336.0,2340.271,So eventually they worked it out and allocated the funding to cities over the summer.,64,,
471,0.97,2340.271,2344.275,We had a little bit of a different journey with our C.A.R.E.S.,64,,
472,0.97,2344.275,2346.711,Act dollars than bigger cities did.,64,,
473,0.97,2346.711,2371.168,"You know, I wanted to highlight in Minneapolis, we--and I think because we learned so much from other cities, we have taken a really Planful approach and a policy approach to the issues that are facing our city around housing stability, around climate justice, around transportation access, all of which have a huge racial disparity component in Minneapolis.",64,,
474,0.97,2371.168,2375.773,We have some of the worst racial disparities in the country.,64,,
475,0.97,2375.773,2377.174,We are taking that seriously.,64,,
476,0.97,2377.174,2390.354,We took a policy approach to the issues and adopted the first strategic action plan.,64,,
477,0.97,2390.354,2392.089,We adopted the master plan.,64,,
478,0.97,2392.089,2402.166,We adopted vision zero and transportation action plans with a lot of specificity in terms of Priorization for transportation and infrastructure projects.,64,,
479,0.97,2402.166,2403.768,We have a climate action plan.,64,,
480,0.97,2403.768,2408.706,A Renter first policy that talks about the commitment to protecting Renters.,64,,
481,0.97,2408.706,2415.679,And we have also taken a Gegraphic approach to identifying particular areas of the city for investment priority.,64,,
482,0.97,2415.679,2418.749,So we have a green zone Priorization as well as cultural districts.,64,,
483,0.97,2418.749,2428.125,And both of them are essentially Sectioningoff different parts of the city for investment and policy priority.,64,,
484,0.97,2428.125,2431.662,Parts of the city that have higher health impacts.,64,,
485,0.97,2431.662,2438.903,Parts of the city that are lower income and higher concentrations of communities of color.,64,,
486,0.97,2438.903,2446.01,We are able to use the existing Frameworks and designations to focus the resources to meet our race equity goals.,64,,
487,0.97,2446.01,2454.318,"That's helping us as we figure out what to cut in our budgets, as well as opportunities for spending like the American rescue plan offers.",64,,
488,0.97,2454.318,2460.324,I thought it would be helpful to giver a little context.,64,,
489,0.97,2460.324,2462.126,Our 2020 budget was originally $1.89 billion.,64,,
490,0.97,2462.126,2467.832,About a third of that is general fund.,64,,
491,0.97,2467.832,2472.97,"And the other two-thirds are fee revenue, water, infrastructure systems, its.",64,,
492,0.97,2472.97,2478.042,So about $500 million in general funds in an average year in Minneapolis.,64,,
493,0.97,2478.042,2479.81,And we have been growing.,64,,
494,0.97,2479.81,2481.812,So that's been going up.,64,,
495,0.97,2481.812,2487.384,"Over the summer, we cut $86 million in spending.",64,,
496,0.97,2487.384,2496.06,We implemented a hiring freeze and used some of the Reserve Fundings to balance the budget for the 2020 budget.,64,,
497,0.97,2496.06,2502.566,Like I'm sure all cities were facing short falls.,64,,
498,0.97,2502.566,2505.269,"Eventually, we received $32 million directly from C.A.R.E.S.",64,,
499,0.97,2505.269,2505.436,Act.,64,,
500,0.97,2505.436,2507.972,"We had a horrible year, like many other cities.",64,,
501,0.97,2507.972,2510.574,Probably more so in Minneapolis.,64,,
502,0.97,2510.574,2517.815,Just handling the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd and the social unrest that followed.,64,,
503,0.97,2517.815,2521.518,"As of January, it's higher now.",64,,
504,0.97,2521.518,2524.989,"We had about 30,000 Covid cases.",64,,
505,0.97,2524.989,2526.39,Just under 400 deaths.,64,,
506,0.97,2526.39,2531.662,We have more homeless Encampments throughout the city.,64,,
507,0.97,2531.662,2532.496,"About 144,000 unemployed people.",64,,
508,0.97,2532.496,2534.598,1700 businesses that were closed because of the pandemic.,64,,
509,0.97,2534.598,2542.94,And then we also have $350 million worth of property damage after the social unrest that happened over the summer.,64,,
510,0.97,2542.94,2552.249,So our response to Covid has been also a response to all of these various economic and social factors affecting our city.,64,,
511,0.97,2552.249,2557.421,We were able to invest about $26 million in immediate relief and response last year.,64,,
512,0.97,2557.421,2561.525,That was kind of in possibly three or four buckets.,64,,
513,0.97,2561.525,2570.901,"We were responding directly to Coronavirus by getting Ppe to our own city staff, but also in the community and then also doing Covid testing.",64,,
514,0.97,2570.901,2576.941,We have our own city health Department in addition to the county and state health Department.,64,,
515,0.97,2576.941,2589.219,And ours is often an extra layer and we focus our investments in race equity and health equity goals for the Minneapolis populations.,64,,
516,0.97,2589.219,2598.162,We put up testing sites in population centers we wanted to reach specific to Minneapolis cultural populations and lower income parts of the city.,64,,
517,0.97,2598.162,2606.203,And we have done a better job in recent years of making sure that our outreach and engagement is Culturely specific.,64,,
518,0.97,2606.203,2615.913,We have a Covid Website set up that specifically acknowledging the harm that many communities in Minneapolis experienced in interactions with government in the past.,64,,
519,0.97,2615.913,2622.286,And just really trying to help create more partnerships with Community-Based organizations that have more trust.,64,,
520,0.97,2622.286,2635.366,So we kind of have a mix of direct service from the city and funding organizations that are more Community-Based and community rooted.,64,,
521,0.97,2635.366,2638.268,We focused on housing and emergency shelter and homelessness outreach.,64,,
522,0.97,2638.268,2641.639,That was done a lot in partnership with our County.,64,,
523,0.97,2641.639,2646.71,"Like I said, we have probably the best relationship with our County that we have had in a really long time.",64,,
524,0.97,2646.71,2652.583,We have been able to pool our resources for shelter and housing supports.,64,,
525,0.97,2652.583,2658.155,Sometimes they have capital dollars and we have operating dollars.,64,,
526,0.97,2658.155,2670.3,"The city has in recent years been more open to using funding for shelter operations than we had been in the past because in Minneapolis, our County is really responsible for shelter operations.",64,,
527,0.97,2670.3,2678.175,But we have really started to step up and recognize that the city needs to play a bigger role for us to really meet the need.,64,,
528,0.97,2678.175,2683.18,"And it's a constant debate, as I'm sure you have.",64,,
529,0.97,2683.18,2690.621,"Because like many cities, in the population centers, we have the vast majority of the shelter beds in the city.",64,,
530,0.97,2690.621,2698.195,We are doing a lot to provide for a regional homelessness response and a statewide homelessness response in our city.,64,,
531,0.97,2698.195,2702.032,We aren't quite meeting the need without the city stepping in.,64,,
532,0.97,2702.032,2708.305,We did direct relief payments to small businesses in a form of Forgivable loans.,64,,
533,0.97,2708.305,2715.579,As well as we put city money and Federal dollars passing through the city to emergency rental assistance.,64,,
534,0.97,2715.579,2718.582,Both of those things were also funded by the county and the state directly.,64,,
535,0.97,2718.582,2729.893,And then we also looked to waive fees in particular for businesses impacted by property damage from social unrest.,64,,
536,0.97,2729.893,2739.603,But generally looked at ways we could reduce the property taxes and fees for the businesses affected by the pandemic and the social unrest.,64,,
537,0.97,2739.603,2746.11,And we Transitioned the work force to Covid protocols and social distancing and remote work environments.,64,,
538,0.97,2746.11,2754.384,"So I think like lots of cities, the needs in the community increased at the same time the budgets decreased.",64,,
539,0.97,2754.384,2755.219,That's the tension we're all balancing.,64,,
540,0.97,2755.219,2763.393,"As we look to Arp, the 2021 budget context.",64,,
541,0.97,2763.393,2771.068,We adopt a budget at the end of each year that starts for the January calendar year.,64,,
542,0.97,2771.068,2776.94,So our 2021 budget was adopted in December and started in January.,64,,
543,0.97,2776.94,2778.275,That was $1.7 billion.,64,,
544,0.97,2778.275,2783.013,About one-third of that is the general fund.,64,,
545,0.97,2783.013,2789.353,"Right now, we're holding 395 positions vacant, about 9% of our work force.",64,,
546,0.97,2789.353,2792.389,"We have just over 4,000 staff typically in our city.",64,,
547,0.97,2792.389,2801.698,And so we're planning to hire back about 44 of those positions right now under the 2021 adopted budget in a phased manner.,64,,
548,0.97,2801.698,2822.152,"Part of the question for us as we look at Arp is how much should we invest in our own city staffing which has taken this large cut, versus and in addition to getting money out the door directly to Community-Based organizations or directly to Renters or business owners, et cetera.",64,,
549,0.97,2822.152,2832.863,"And I think, you know, this is particularly important as we look at gender and race equity in our own work force.",64,,
550,0.97,2832.863,2842.139,We have seen that women and workers of color in our city have taken on a lot of the burden of the situation that we see in our budget.,64,,
551,0.97,2842.139,2849.112,"While we have a hiring freeze in place and fewer staff available to do the work, we're asking more and more of our staff.",64,,
552,0.97,2849.112,2850.981,Our community is asking more and more of the city.,64,,
553,0.97,2850.981,3085.215,And I would.,64,,
554,0.97,3085.215,3087.984,"We have a housing moratorium, Eviction moratorium at the state.",65,,
555,0.97,3087.984,3094.591,Just one example of the kind of topic we're thinking about using over the three-year time frame.,65,,
556,0.97,3094.591,3105.101,"Otherwise, we're looking at ways to support our small businesses, support Renters facing Eviction, building out shelter, purchasing hotels with the county.",65,,
557,0.97,3105.101,3110.774,And all of that helped and informed by the policies we have in place.,65,,
558,0.97,3110.774,3130.227,"Because we adopted the 2040 plan, we have adopted a lot of zoning regulations and reforms enabling us to build shelter quickly, buy hotels and turn them into Sro housing that wouldn't have been possible before the zoning reforms.",65,,
559,0.97,3130.227,3130.694,Thank you.,65,,
560,0.97,3130.694,3133.163,Thank you very much for the overview.,66,,
561,0.97,3133.163,3135.132,And there's a lot of similarities.,66,,
562,0.97,3135.132,3138.768,Really excited about the overview that you provided.,66,,
563,0.97,3138.768,3143.74,"And colleagues, I will ask you to hold your questions and we'll have a chance to have questions.",66,,
564,0.97,3143.74,3150.514,"I want to turn it over next to Councilmember Robin Kniech from Denver city Council, where I was born.",66,,
565,0.97,3150.514,3160.09,I have been in awe of her leadership in housing.,66,,
566,0.97,3160.09,3166.663,We had the chance to meet at a meeting in Chicago around housing and housing equity.,66,,
567,0.97,3166.663,3179.776,We want to share your slides as well.,66,,
568,0.97,3179.776,3182.812,We want to make you a Cohost.,66,,
569,0.97,3182.812,3188.618,And we will then hear from Austin.,66,,
570,0.97,3188.618,3190.987,"So Councilwoman, I would love to hear from you.",66,,
571,0.97,3190.987,3194.858,And make sure you can access to all of our technology tools to share your slides as well.,66,,
572,0.97,3194.991,3199.396,Good morning.,67,,
573,0.97,3199.396,3204.1,I appear to have the power to share my slides.,67,,
574,0.97,3204.1,3206.169,I want to say how humbled I am.,67,,
575,0.97,3206.169,3209.406,It's usually us learning from Seattle.,67,,
576,0.97,3209.406,3210.24,It's Humbling to be here.,67,,
577,0.97,3210.24,3212.475,I hope you can see my screen.,67,,
578,0.97,3212.475,3216.079,"But I guess I want to commend you, first of all.",67,,
579,0.97,3216.079,3220.15,I read your resolution that your Council passed to set priorities.,67,,
580,0.97,3220.15,3226.389,What I thought I would highlight is where there were things that I saw not mentioned in it or might be slightly different.,67,,
581,0.97,3226.389,3229.426,I think that will be the focus.,67,,
582,0.97,3229.426,3231.628,I appreciate all of the ground work.,67,,
583,0.97,3231.628,3236.399,We are very similar cities in some ways size wise.,67,,
584,0.97,3236.399,3238.235,"Denver and Seattle, about 700,000 folks in Denver.",67,,
585,0.97,3238.235,3243.173,We are a city and a County.,67,,
586,0.97,3243.173,3244.207,That creates a few differences.,67,,
587,0.97,3244.207,3245.709,We operate our human services here.,67,,
588,0.97,3245.709,3248.812,We are the city and the county.,67,,
589,0.97,3248.812,3251.181,"The city operates the jail, we have human services.",67,,
590,0.97,3251.181,3257.52,We have some of the things that you all might have in a typical county in your community.,67,,
591,0.97,3257.52,3263.66,So we also are a much stronger Mayor form of government than Minneapolis or Seattle.,67,,
592,0.97,3263.66,3270.667,"So like Minneapolis, our proposals will originate with the Mayor.",67,,
593,0.97,3270.667,3274.17,We may not need to amend the budget for some of these.,67,,
594,0.97,3274.17,3276.206,Council approval for a half million dollars.,67,,
595,0.97,3276.206,3286.249,"In some cases, the types of money from the Federal Government may or may not require a budget amendments.",67,,
596,0.97,3286.249,3286.883,A few differences.,67,,
597,0.97,3286.883,3292.522,We also use an annual budget process that begins in January of the calendar year.,67,,
598,0.97,3292.522,3302.365,"And like Minneapolis, I think you're going to see we are thinking about some dollars spent right away.",67,,
599,0.97,3302.365,3308.505,We don't want to see an emergency rush to program all of the dollars in a temporary fashion.,67,,
600,0.97,3308.505,3313.877,We have a lot more robust public engagement in the budget process.,67,,
601,0.97,3313.877,3315.278,There is more transparency that happens.,67,,
602,0.97,3315.278,3317.58,You can see where city dollars match Federal dollars.,67,,
603,0.97,3317.58,3322.152,There are things you get when you put the dollars through the budget process.,67,,
604,0.97,3322.152,3326.189,"So real quick, I'm going to breeze through a few background pieces.",67,,
605,0.97,3326.189,3329.359,Let me see if I can get this to go.,67,,
606,0.97,3329.359,3333.93,"Our Mayor's administration, these are the objectives that they have laid out.",67,,
607,0.97,3333.93,3337.233,"So getting some funding out in a timely manner, right?",67,,
608,0.97,3337.233,3342.172,But then also using the budget process for a portion of the dollars.,67,,
609,0.97,3342.172,3346.643,So Sustainability is the thing that we have been talking about here.,67,,
610,0.97,3346.643,3353.149,"You know, Lisa mentioned the fact there's a lot of workers in a city that are furloughed or out of work.",67,,
611,0.97,3353.149,3355.452,I think we do want to bring back city services.,67,,
612,0.97,3355.452,3358.154,And I want to be clear.,67,,
613,0.97,3358.154,3363.626,We don't want to bring back city workers just because it's good for them as individuals.,67,,
614,0.97,3363.626,3367.53,It's good for our city to have folks able to deliver services.,67,,
615,0.97,3367.53,3371.768,And those workers purchase things in our community.,67,,
616,0.97,3371.768,3372.335,It is stimulus.,67,,
617,0.97,3372.335,3380.31,Their employment has as much as an economic effect when they go out and spend their paycheck as other workers.,67,,
618,0.97,3380.31,3388.585,But we don't want to hire back the city workers we can't keep on the budget for the long term.,67,,
619,0.97,3388.585,3389.085,We're being thoughtful.,67,,
620,0.97,3389.085,3393.69,"For example, we have a backlog for permitting.",67,,
621,0.97,3393.69,3394.557,"We might use contractors, for example.",67,,
622,0.97,3394.557,3405.468,"We'll Hae to be looking at all of that to see where we want to use an outside provider, a community provider, where we want to grow the city staff.",67,,
623,0.97,3405.468,3406.77,We want Sustainability.,67,,
624,0.97,3406.77,3412.809,"And similar in all cities, the equity and racial equity lens for proposals.",67,,
625,0.97,3412.809,3415.612,These are the four buckets the administration proposed.,67,,
626,0.97,3415.612,3418.181,I'm not going to read these.,67,,
627,0.97,3418.181,3426.089,I can share the slides with the committee staff afterwards.,67,,
628,0.97,3426.089,3426.556,Supplemental services.,67,,
629,0.97,3426.556,3429.626,These are the things I mentioned that are Backlogs.,67,,
630,0.97,3429.626,3436.699,This might be the repairs and things from the civil unrest in Minneapolis might go.,67,,
631,0.97,3436.699,3438.201,They're not ongoing services.,67,,
632,0.97,3438.201,3439.569,But they require an infusion.,67,,
633,0.97,3439.569,3457.654,"The emergency response, although I want to say I think we all want to be really thoughtful about using Federal dollars that are designated for a specific recovery purpose first before using our flexible local government dollars.",67,,
634,0.97,3457.654,3470.567,"If there is funding for a particular human services need or a food assistance need, we should be using food dollars for food before we use general flexible dollars for food.",67,,
635,0.97,3470.567,3473.069,That's a principle we're thinking about here.,67,,
636,0.97,3473.069,3474.337,And economic recovery.,67,,
637,0.97,3474.337,3482.178,Just a few of the things the administration is thinking about in presenting to us as a city council.,67,,
638,0.97,3482.178,3483.78,These are the types of priorities.,67,,
639,0.97,3483.78,3488.084,"It sounds like in Seattle, you all went to priorities we set previously.",67,,
640,0.97,3488.084,3494.19,We're not changing the direction of the city because we got new dollars.,67,,
641,0.97,3494.19,3502.232,We're asking how do the new dollars help us achieve the direction of the city we already set.,67,,
642,0.97,3502.232,3503.733,The top are very pandemic specific.,67,,
643,0.97,3503.733,3506.202,Public health and food assistance and things like that.,67,,
644,0.97,3506.202,3512.041,You can see the bottom half are longer term.,67,,
645,0.97,3512.041,3515.445,Mitigating and reducing involuntary displacement.,67,,
646,0.97,3515.445,3517.413,"There is a pandemic, perhaps, escalation.",67,,
647,0.97,3517.413,3523.786,We see development is not slowing in our city just because of the pandemic.,67,,
648,0.97,3523.786,3526.756,"It's a recession hitting different segments differently, right?",67,,
649,0.97,3526.756,3530.56,So we still have the pressures of displacement.,67,,
650,0.97,3530.56,3535.565,You will see that our broader priorities are broader than the pandemic.,67,,
651,0.97,3535.565,3542.071,And we'll think about ways to address the long-term priorities as we go.,67,,
652,0.97,3542.071,3547.51,So here are some things I thought about as I was reading your list.,67,,
653,0.97,3547.51,3549.512,We are in a similar early stage.,67,,
654,0.97,3549.512,3553.55,We don't have guidance yet from the Department of Treasury.,67,,
655,0.97,3553.55,3556.052,"We don't yet have a quote, Unquote, plan.",67,,
656,0.97,3556.052,3560.29,"We're doing our rounds just like you are, about the same time line.",67,,
657,0.97,3560.29,3562.091,Here are things I have been thinking about.,67,,
658,0.97,3562.091,3566.896,"You have a lot about the what, right?",67,,
659,0.97,3566.896,3570.366,"You want gender equity, violence prevention, work on homelessness and housing.",67,,
660,0.97,3570.366,3572.869,"I want to encourage you all, and we're thinking a lot about the how.",67,,
661,0.97,3572.869,3579.342,"So we know that food assistance, for example, can be done in kind.",67,,
662,0.97,3579.342,3580.043,"It's very inefficient, right?",67,,
663,0.97,3580.043,3584.914,"You have to find a place to store the food, get folks there, have a distribution system.",67,,
664,0.97,3584.914,3593.656,We're learning a lot internationally and Denver has been trying to bring the lessons in about the value of cash assistance.,67,,
665,0.97,3593.656,3596.059,I know you're doing the grocery cards there.,67,,
666,0.97,3596.059,3604.0,We have created the left behind worker fund for workers not eligible for unemployment or for stimulus checks.,67,,
667,0.97,3604.0,3608.438,This left behind worker fund is benefitting them with direct cash assistance.,67,,
668,0.97,3608.438,3618.247,"It's one time and designed in a way to hopefully minimize the impacts to immigration applications, should they make them later.",67,,
669,0.97,3618.247,3622.619,There was a public charge rule in effect.,67,,
670,0.97,3622.619,3624.487,"Hopefully, that goes away.",67,,
671,0.97,3624.487,3625.321,We wanted to be thoughtful.,67,,
672,0.97,3625.321,3630.093,We're using one-time assistance for that set of workers.,67,,
673,0.97,3630.093,3633.763,Mostly benefitting immigrants and refugees not eligible for other forms of assistance.,67,,
674,0.97,3633.763,3642.605,I will also say we have a pilot coming from a private sector leader about homelessness.,67,,
675,0.97,3642.605,3654.617,And the Vancouver new leaf program is for those experiencing homelessness who may not have the long-term deep embedded issues with supportive housing.,67,,
676,0.97,3654.617,3659.222,They may be newer homeless or shorter term homeless.,67,,
677,0.97,3659.222,3663.626,And those individuals experiment with one-time assistance and monthly assistance ..,67,,
678,0.97,3663.626,3665.628,And they're going to study the results.,67,,
679,0.97,3665.628,3676.873,We should be trying new things with these dollars and studying the results of them for the purposes of Scaling them up and sustaining them as a new way of doing business going forward.,67,,
680,0.97,3676.873,3684.914,So I think thinking about cash versus in kind is a really important thing to think about.,67,,
681,0.97,3684.914,3686.849,Lisa mentioned transportation and mobility.,67,,
682,0.97,3686.849,3689.352,I know that's a priority in Seattle as well.,67,,
683,0.97,3689.352,3692.922,There is a stimulus effect of using dollars for the infrastructure.,67,,
684,0.97,3692.922,3693.222,No question.,67,,
685,0.97,3693.222,3697.093,"And like Minneapolis, we have a number of plans pointing us in that direction.",67,,
686,0.97,3697.093,3706.502,I will say it's often us as a city choosing which projects to fund.,67,,
687,0.97,3706.502,3718.147,"I believe the funds given the fact they're rescue funds, we could use the budget to identify the intersections in the neighborhood to Prioritize for safety.",67,,
688,0.97,3718.147,3718.347,Right?,67,,
689,0.97,3718.347,3723.553,Where is a bus stop needing improvement?,67,,
690,0.97,3723.553,3732.061,So thinking about ways to bring budgeting to a portion of the dollars.,67,,
691,0.97,3732.061,3738.134,"Next, you all already have robust programs for work force training and construction in Seattle.",67,,
692,0.97,3738.134,3750.613,"But for us, as we see new investments in infrastructure, we're just beginning our apprenticeship utilization requirements and targeted hiring.",67,,
693,0.97,3750.613,3757.32,"We have a very, very small tiny number of women in the construction trading working on our city projects.",67,,
694,0.97,3757.32,3765.928,"If we're doing infrastructure as a form of stimulus, we have an obligation to make sure that the jobs are being filled by more women and people of color.",67,,
695,0.97,3765.928,3772.969,"We are thinking about how do we--right now, we have the Preapprenticeship programs, but you're not paid to participant.",67,,
696,0.97,3772.969,3790.386,"You have to decide whether or not to give up a paid job or to keep your job and then try to--so if we want people to change careers, we need to give them an income while they're changing careers.",67,,
697,0.97,3790.386,3792.088,Talking about Stipends and women.,67,,
698,0.97,3792.088,3797.126,And we have an alternatives to policing program.,67,,
699,0.97,3797.126,3802.632,We know the pandemic exacerbated mental health challenges and it's harder to get services during periods when things were closed.,67,,
700,0.97,3802.632,3808.304,"We have a program called the Star program, which is our support team asked response.",67,,
701,0.97,3808.304,3810.606,It has been in operation since June 1ST.,67,,
702,0.97,3810.606,3816.312,It is a social worker and an Emt who goes out on calls.,67,,
703,0.97,3816.312,3824.253,"We are right now sending that team in one neighborhood or central part of the city, one zone of the city.",67,,
704,0.97,3824.253,3830.793,They are doing about less than 1% of the calls they could be doing.,67,,
705,0.97,3830.793,3836.766,"Instead of sending a police officer, we have had zero arrests, zero use of force situations.",67,,
706,0.97,3836.766,3837.133,Very successful.,67,,
707,0.97,3837.133,3847.143,So how is it that we try to bring that more Sustainably to the budget?,67,,
708,0.97,3847.143,3847.343,Land.,67,,
709,0.97,3847.343,3848.978,You all talked about buying buildings.,67,,
710,0.97,3848.978,3850.213,"Honestly, it could just be land.",67,,
711,0.97,3850.213,3862.558,"Where we can use the funds to bring land to public ownership, it may be for affordable housing and other community purposes, child care, that's a image theme of our pandemic gaps.",67,,
712,0.97,3862.558,3867.597,"Where we have control of the land, we can set the terms for how it's used.",67,,
713,0.97,3867.597,3876.138,"Even if we're not the long-term land holder, we might do a lease and have the affordable housing and child care operating by others.",67,,
714,0.97,3876.138,3879.742,We are dictating the use in ways that prevent displacement.,67,,
715,0.97,3879.742,3886.215,And I put in here I want us to think about the pros and cons of replicating funding.,67,,
716,0.97,3886.215,3889.752,There's a lot of business assistance coming from the Federal Government.,67,,
717,0.97,3889.752,3892.054,"In Colorado, the state government as well.",67,,
718,0.97,3892.054,3897.393,I think we need to be really thoughtful about triple down playing on the same industries.,67,,
719,0.97,3897.393,3904.867,"It's important to help the Industries recover, but it's really thoughtful about what city dollars need to be doing.",67,,
720,0.97,3904.867,3914.11,"In many ways, we keep getting asked to fill the gaps that other levels of government are not doing their responsibilities.",67,,
721,0.97,3914.11,3917.013,"Finally, they're stepping up at the other levels.",67,,
722,0.97,3917.013,3922.518,"If and when we do business assistance, we have to be building the economy back better.",67,,
723,0.97,3922.518,3926.555,We're deeply concerned about the right to Rehire.,67,,
724,0.97,3926.555,3927.99,Who gets hired back?,67,,
725,0.97,3927.99,3933.596,Are you less likely to hire back someone who is older and considered more vulnerable?,67,,
726,0.97,3933.596,3940.703,"Really ensuring if we are giving the business assistance, they are hiring back in the order that workers were left from the jobs.",67,,
727,0.97,3940.703,3948.144,"So I'll stop there and, you know, just wanted to give you guys things that maybe weren't quite in the memo, but you might have been thinking about.",67,,
728,0.97,3948.144,3950.579,And I want to learn from all of you as well.,67,,
729,0.97,3950.579,3950.913,So thank you.,67,,
730,0.97,3951.047,3954.684,Thank you very much.,68,,
731,0.97,3954.684,3956.319,That was fascinating.,68,,
732,0.97,3956.319,3962.491,And I really appreciate you providing that context both with the power point and what's in our resolution.,68,,
733,0.97,3962.491,3962.825,Very helpful.,68,,
734,0.97,3962.825,3966.362,There is a lot of cross over.,68,,
735,0.97,3966.362,3971.434,"And next, let's hear from Councilmember Fuentes from Austin city council.",68,,
736,0.97,3971.434,3972.468,Very excited to have you here.,68,,
737,0.97,3972.468,3976.272,We have not had the chance to meet in person yet.,68,,
738,0.97,3976.272,3980.443,Tell us a little bit more about what you have been up to.,68,,
739,0.97,3980.443,3985.247,We know you have made a mark on the work you are doing in Austin.,68,,
740,0.97,3985.247,3989.151,Look forward to hearing the frame work you are bringing and what's happening in Austin.,68,,
741,0.97,3989.151,3994.79,"First, thank you so much for inviting me.",69,,
742,0.97,3994.79,3996.992,I hit my 90-day mark this week.,69,,
743,0.97,3996.992,4001.097,"I have been in office, first time elected, 90 days.",69,,
744,0.97,4001.097,4001.764,"Thank you, all.",69,,
745,0.97,4001.764,4006.268,I'm humbled to talk about the work that the Austin city Council has been doing.,69,,
746,0.97,4006.268,4010.806,"So I guess first, I would like to give you all context.",69,,
747,0.97,4010.806,4014.51,We are a manager Council form of government.,69,,
748,0.97,4014.51,4024.82,"And in Austin and in Travis County, we have taken a different approach with the Arp dollars when compared to the C.A.R.E.S.",69,,
749,0.97,4024.82,4026.422,Act K R funding.,69,,
750,0.97,4026.422,4031.127,The city of Austin is approximately slated to receive $196 million.,69,,
751,0.97,4031.127,4041.837,"And Travis County is slated to receive $247 million, with many other of our surrounding cities also getting a sub allocation.",69,,
752,0.97,4041.837,4051.68,"We decided to look at it from a more regional approach, understanding that that's $500 million that's coming in to our area.",69,,
753,0.97,4051.68,4065.494,"And wanting to leverage this opportunity to look at how can we utilize these funds not only to address the needs of today, but to really leverage it in a Transformational, once in a generation way.",69,,
754,0.97,4065.494,4066.495,It's a little bit different.,69,,
755,0.97,4066.495,4071.7,"And of course, we're waiting on the FEMA eligibility for specific guidelines.",69,,
756,0.97,4071.7,4081.277,"It appears there might be some flexibility for us to use these dollars to address some of our biggest, most pressing challenges that we have here in Austin.",69,,
757,0.97,4081.277,4093.522,And so I'm really proud to be part of a progressive coalition that is willing and ready and able to address the biggest challenges together in a formative way.,69,,
758,0.97,4093.522,4103.499,"So with that, and I did put a link in the chat if you wanted to see the presentation that our city staff initially presented to Council a few weeks ago.",69,,
759,0.97,4103.499,4107.903,"That was just the first one, the initial proposal.",69,,
760,0.97,4107.903,4125.087,"And from there, our city Council, and I was proud to cosponsor, a policy that further directed city staff to invest and address four priority areas in our city, that being homelessness and related housing with mental health and substance abuse.",69,,
761,0.97,4125.087,4130.493,"Also looking at early childhood care and education, including high quality and affordable.",69,,
762,0.97,4130.493,4137.433,Looking at jobs and work force development and our work programs.,69,,
763,0.97,4137.433,4143.005,And then fourth being food insecurity and really addressing the food deserts we have in the area.,69,,
764,0.97,4143.005,4147.476,So those were the four things that we outlined in our resolution.,69,,
765,0.97,4147.476,4148.01,I'll pop the link shortly.,69,,
766,0.97,4148.01,4156.452,"With that in mind, that was the lens that we're hoping to take with the Arp funds.",69,,
767,0.97,4156.452,4160.856,"So once city staff presented the initial spending framework, we gave additional policy guidance.",69,,
768,0.97,4160.856,4168.898,And they will come back with the additional ideas and programs to build off of the work we did with the C.A.R.E.S.,69,,
769,0.97,4168.898,4169.265,Act.,69,,
770,0.97,4169.265,4174.069,We are fortunate in Austin to have maintained a healthy amount of reserves.,69,,
771,0.97,4174.069,4176.138,We didn't have to do layoffs.,69,,
772,0.97,4176.138,4190.619,"We did do a round of freezing of any of the vacant positions and assessed each one to ensure if the they were front line employees, we could bring those back on first.",69,,
773,0.97,4190.619,4204.867,"So we Fortunately are able to look at the Arp dollars not needing to fill a deficit, but looking at how to build off of the work we were doing during the pandemic.",69,,
774,0.97,4204.867,4214.677,"So the largest target expenditures for us include economic recovery, looking at services currently funded by the hotel occupancy taxes.",69,,
775,0.97,4214.677,4226.722,"Our hotel taxes, we use those, a large part of it, for creativity art spaces, which we know the creative sector has been hard hit during the pandemic.",69,,
776,0.97,4226.722,4230.793,And keeping a close eye on the public health response.,69,,
777,0.97,4230.793,4236.732,"Here in Austin, our mortality rate has been been equitable.",69,,
778,0.97,4236.732,4239.969,Latinos make up nearly half of the deaths from Covid.,69,,
779,0.97,4239.969,4256.619,We are making sure we're doing similarly to what the other Councilmember mentioned earlier about wanting to have testing sites and vaccine distribution done in an equitable way and Centraling the marginalized and vulnerable communities.,69,,
780,0.97,4256.619,4269.632,"Just a few weeks ago, we launched a mobile vaccine program to get us into hardest hit neighborhoods as another way to address some of barriers we identified with the Online registration process.",69,,
781,0.97,4269.632,4285.781,"Many of our communities are struggling with Digital access and are working families who don't have the time to be, you know, waiting in line for a Lottery-Style appointment process.",69,,
782,0.97,4285.781,4286.048,I digress.,69,,
783,0.97,4286.048,4295.057,I mentioned earlier waiting on FEMA to get back to us or to give us a final determination of the Reimbursable amounts.,69,,
784,0.97,4295.057,4300.763,"And from there, we'll be able to make more detailed line items with these dollars.",69,,
785,0.97,4300.763,4320.783,"The other thing I wanted to mention about public response efforts, you know, with the expense categories that fall under the Covid emergency management that we will continue to leverage the dollars for testing and shelters.",69,,
786,0.97,4320.783,4330.292,"We did protective lodges, converting hotels into isolation areas for individuals who need, you know, keeping a close eye on Multigenerational settings.",69,,
787,0.97,4330.292,4338.667,So we want to be sure we were able to offer a space for individuals who have Covid to go to Self-Isolate as they heal.,69,,
788,0.97,4338.667,4362.024,"And then moving on to the economic recovery bucket, some of the ideas that or the processes we're taking on as far as public engagement includes having city staff has gathered 125 stake holder engagement events or have held 125 stake holder events.",69,,
789,0.97,4362.024,4366.895,They have an Online portal process to receive additional feedback from the community.,69,,
790,0.97,4366.895,4367.963,That's open through April 23rd.,69,,
791,0.97,4367.963,4378.574,The idea there is to utilize the Arp funding for the--to use the feedback on how we should use the Arp funding for the first two years.,69,,
792,0.97,4378.574,4382.177,And let's see.,69,,
793,0.97,4382.177,4400.395,Some of the programs outlined in the presentation from city staff that were recommended for Austin to do include ongoing workshops and counseling and mentor ship programs for small businesses.,69,,
794,0.97,4400.395,4401.663,And looking at business co-ops.,69,,
795,0.97,4401.663,4406.535,Temporarily permitting exceptions and reduced fees for businesses as they begin to fully reopen.,69,,
796,0.97,4406.535,4412.474,"And the other critical component I want to touch on, of course, is child care.",69,,
797,0.97,4412.474,4415.811,"As we know, the pandemic has not affected everyone equally.",69,,
798,0.97,4415.811,4418.046,Women certainly are bearing the brunt of it.,69,,
799,0.97,4418.046,4422.551,We want to ensure that we do more in the child care space.,69,,
800,0.97,4422.551,4430.492,And we're looking at--we did establish a child care grant relief program for child care centers in Austin.,69,,
801,0.97,4430.492,4442.638,We will continue to fund that program and offer financial incentives for individuals to each open a child care center or reopen a Home-Based high quality child care setting.,69,,
802,0.97,4442.638,4448.143,And that's particularly important to my district.,69,,
803,0.97,4448.143,4450.746,"I represent Southeast Austin, a predominantly Latino area.",69,,
804,0.97,4450.746,4451.313,And let's see.,69,,
805,0.97,4451.313,4466.462,"I want to make sure I'm--Oh, some of the programs I'm really excited about that we'll dig into once we learn more is when it comes to food insecurity, as I mentioned, that was the fourth bucket we're looking to really invest in.",69,,
806,0.97,4466.462,4472.768,It includes equipping residents with tools to grow their own food at home.,69,,
807,0.97,4472.768,4486.882,"So really em Powering communities and giving them the tools to learn the skill and be able to have their own food forest, so to speak, or community garden.",69,,
808,0.97,4486.882,4489.284,Looking at closing the Digital divide.,69,,
809,0.97,4489.284,4493.222,And then of course asking local arts and cultural organizations.,69,,
810,0.97,4493.222,4504.967,"Right now, we're in the process of setting up navigators to help our restaurants and small businesses apply for those big funding buckets that are already outlined in the Arp.",69,,
811,0.97,4504.967,4515.344,"We want to get as many of our businesses in line because that one is a first come, first served billion dollar investment that's outlined in the Arp.",69,,
812,0.97,4515.344,4523.619,We are wanting to make sure we're positioning our businesses to understand the process and to apply for those Federal dollars.,69,,
813,0.97,4523.619,4542.671,"If we're able to get as many of our businesses the support they need and the restaurants the support, that opens up the funding for us for the local allotment to really dive in and target investment and recovery.",69,,
814,0.97,4542.671,4550.145,Those are some of the things that I just wanted to touch on really quickly.,69,,
815,0.97,4550.145,4551.88,I'm happy to dive in more.,69,,
816,0.97,4551.88,4557.052,But I'm especially looking forward to how we're able to leverage these dollars to address homelessness.,69,,
817,0.97,4557.052,4562.491,That is an issue that many of our big cities are facing right now.,69,,
818,0.97,4562.491,4579.975,"So I really want to--I think that this we're talking about doing a once in a generation, having $500 million come into our area, that is the number one issue and area that our Council has built consensus around addressing.",69,,
819,0.97,4579.975,4580.943,Thank you so much.,69,,
820,0.97,4580.943,4582.578,Thank you very much.,70,,
821,0.97,4582.578,4584.279,And thank you all very much for your presentations.,70,,
822,0.97,4584.279,4592.354,I really appreciate the opportunity to hear from all of your cities.,70,,
823,0.97,4592.354,4592.921,"And again, local progress.",70,,
824,0.97,4592.921,4600.228,Gons President Gonzcez with us is on the board of local progress.,70,,
825,0.97,4600.228,4606.201,Councilmember Herbold is a long-time supporter and there as the local progress began the roots.,70,,
826,0.97,4606.201,4610.339,"We are champions of the entity and the network, and this is why.",70,,
827,0.97,4610.339,4614.543,You all providing the feedback directly to Councilmembers so we can learn from each other is exciting.,70,,
828,0.97,4614.543,4629.691,And I think this is exactly what we should be doing so we don't Miss a minute with learning from others and helping to create more harmony and equity as we recover from the crises.,70,,
829,0.97,4629.691,4638.2,I love what you talked about in Termsover expediting permitting and decreasing the fees for the businesses.,70,,
830,0.97,4638.2,4645.64,And the navigator program for small businesses and folks that need access to programs across the city.,70,,
831,0.97,4645.64,4656.652,"In Denver, I love the emphasis on the cash assistance, recognizing that people should have the listen to use those dollars and often know best how to use the dollars.",70,,
832,0.97,4656.652,4660.655,Look forward to hearing more about the two approaches for the direct cash assistance.,70,,
833,0.97,4660.655,4664.059,But the overall message was really helpful.,70,,
834,0.97,4664.059,4674.436,"And in Minneapolis, I'm fascinated ability how we can do more with our County partners and how do we look at capital dollars and matching those.",70,,
835,0.97,4674.436,4675.804,It's often one versus the other.,70,,
836,0.97,4675.804,4683.445,I heard you lift up both of the investments and trying to find ways to get away from the excuses and push forward with the strategies.,70,,
837,0.97,4683.445,4685.68,Very excited to hear from all of you.,70,,
838,0.97,4685.68,4692.688,Let's open it up to questions or comments from colleagues today.,70,,
839,0.97,4692.688,4694.623,"Councilmembers, anything you would like to ask?",70,,
840,0.97,4694.623,4698.86,Okay.,70,,
841,0.97,4698.86,4702.197,I am not seeing additional questions.,70,,
842,0.97,4702.197,4707.469,I did have a question about the Star program in Denver.,70,,
843,0.97,4707.469,4724.72,You may have heard of our health one team here in Seattle as well where we have firefighters paired with case managers and are trying to relieve 911 of the calls related to health related issues and hopefully more mental health related issues as we scale up the program.,70,,
844,0.97,4724.72,4730.425,We have gone from one Van to three vans to cover three of the five zones for the firefighter ladder divisions.,70,,
845,0.97,4730.425,4734.463,And looking forward to Scaling that up.,70,,
846,0.97,4734.463,4750.812,"But Councilmember Kniech, I'm wondering if we could do an analysis about how the programs have relieved calls from having to go to traditional 911 armed officer response and there's any analysis we could do together.",70,,
847,0.97,4750.812,4754.216,Is there anything else you would like to share about the stars program and when that started?,70,,
848,0.97,4754.216,4758.92,I will say that we don't have an external Evaluator yet.,71,,
849,0.97,4758.92,4762.924,I hope that we will go there in terms of true return on investment.,71,,
850,0.97,4762.924,4773.668,"What I can tell you is that in our data, it's showing that the responders are spending about 30% less time than a police response would require.",71,,
851,0.97,4773.668,4781.476,So it's both different personnel who frankly probably are lower cost than what an officer who is armed would cost.,71,,
852,0.97,4781.476,4791.052,But it's also that they're doing it faster so that it is freeing up and reducing the hours spent on armed police response.,71,,
853,0.97,4791.052,4794.222,So that's one data point we have.,71,,
854,0.97,4794.222,4798.827,And we're in the process of trying to expedite our expansion.,71,,
855,0.97,4798.827,4804.266,So it sounds like you have jumped ahead in terms of quality.,71,,
856,0.97,4804.266,4806.468,We're trying to get four more vans going.,71,,
857,0.97,4806.468,4808.637,Having some debate about the time line.,71,,
858,0.97,4808.637,4811.573,"Vice President chair Herbold, go ahead.",72,,
859,0.97,4811.573,4815.277,"Thank you so much, chair Mosqueda for the line of questioning.",73,,
860,0.97,4815.277,4817.345,I stepped away from my computer.,73,,
861,0.97,4817.345,4818.98,That was perfect.,73,,
862,0.97,4818.98,4822.684,Just a follow-up on the questions about the Star program.,73,,
863,0.97,4822.684,4832.594,Are you anticipating potentially seeking Arp funding for your scaleup?,73,,
864,0.97,4832.594,4861.79,"There certainly has been an increase in our communities for the types of response that result from various types of crises, mental health, domestic violence, substance abuse disorder crises.",73,,
865,0.97,4861.79,4864.392,People are in crisis to a greater extent.,73,,
866,0.97,4864.392,4872.5,And a lot of experts in the field associate that Uptick with Covid-19.,73,,
867,0.97,4872.5,4880.942,I'm just wondering if you are considering that to make it possible to apply for Arp funding for your expansion?,73,,
868,0.97,4881.076,4885.18,We are currently using a combination.,74,,
869,0.97,4885.18,4886.748,Denver voters have been very generous.,74,,
870,0.97,4886.748,4892.621,We have a dedicated sales tax that provides funding for mental health services.,74,,
871,0.97,4892.621,4895.29,That grant funding is what started the program.,74,,
872,0.97,4895.29,4901.696,We did win general fund dollars for it as well in the 2021 budget.,74,,
873,0.97,4901.696,4904.766,I think the short answer is it Dependses.,74,,
874,0.97,4904.766,4914.743,We have an informal agreement to do an additional expansion using Maybe some of our reserves or contingency dollars we saved.,74,,
875,0.97,4914.743,4918.179,We couldn't get there in the budget cycle.,74,,
876,0.97,4918.179,4920.649,We anticipate a mid year conversation.,74,,
877,0.97,4920.649,4922.684,There are potentially local funds available.,74,,
878,0.97,4922.684,4937.666,"If we can sustain a bigger expansion more quickly by using those dollars and then keep it going by bringing it into our general fund budget in year three, because Obviously, these are two-year dollars.",74,,
879,0.97,4937.666,4940.902,We can spend them through 2024.,74,,
880,0.97,4940.902,4944.506,"In some ways, they're three or four year dollars.",74,,
881,0.97,4944.506,4949.744,Our goal is to not fund something we can't keep going if it's an ongoing need.,74,,
882,0.97,4949.744,4955.617,We'll wait for the Treasury guidance like everybody to see whether or not it's eligible and all of that.,74,,
883,0.97,4955.617,4966.328,"I hope that we don't--if we can fund it with our local dollars and use the Arp dollars for something else needed, that's a Win/Win too in my mind.",74,,
884,0.97,4966.328,4971.466,It's about using the dollars for what they're eligible for.,74,,
885,0.97,4971.466,4976.738,That allows you to be more thoughtful about other dollars.,74,,
886,0.97,4976.738,4976.871,.,74,,
887,0.97,4976.871,4977.205,Excellent.,75,,
888,0.97,4977.205,4979.474,Thank you.,75,,
889,0.97,4979.474,5009.604,"The other thing I wanted to lift up that it sounds like is a Commonality across jurisdiction is the ways in which you're looking to use the Arpa dollars to make sure that the city services get Reinitiated and maybe expanded in certain areas where folks have been harmed by the trauma has Covid, and whether that's expanding services in child care or trying to figure out access to community centers.",75,,
890,0.97,5009.604,5013.475,I can't remember the wording used.,75,,
891,0.97,5013.475,5018.313,Like a Community-Oriented sort of strategy to bring people together and Reinitiate the community gatherings.,75,,
892,0.97,5018.313,5029.124,"It's a way to help with the mental health and trauma of isolation and potential, you know, depression that a lot of the families are facing.",75,,

894,0.97,5037.432,5040.969,Funding Community-Based organizations and the direct service providers through the city.,75,,
895,0.97,5040.969,5045.34,I loved hearing some of those themes and look forward to learning from you on those pieces as well.,75,,
896,0.97,5045.34,5058.62,Both in terms of how we respond to the trauma that individuals are suffering with and reinvest in the economy to make it more equitable and do so with a racial justice lens.,75,,
897,0.97,5058.62,5059.754,Thank you all very much.,75,,

1008,0.97,5574.769,5588.449,And it's unique in that it combines the business owners and advocates and workers and community members to provide insights on advancing labor standards.,106,,
1009,0.97,5588.449,5598.893,Commissioners are invested in improving work place conditions for workers and ensuring that businesses have the tools and information they need to comply with labor standards.,106,,
1010,0.97,5598.893,5602.296,I am thrilled to work the Joel Shapiro going forward.,106,,
1011,0.97,5602.296,5622.083,"And as you will hear from him, like the other business owners, Joel offers the valuable perspective of running a business and creating the work opportunities for the workers that value them and protect their rights.",106,,
1012,0.97,5622.083,5624.719,And doing that in the gig committee.,106,,
1013,0.97,5624.719,5637.598,"As they change the focus to thinking about the future of work and creating labor standards for the new economy, his expertise will prove invaluable.",106,,
1014,0.97,5637.598,5641.369,Seattle is advancing the best practices and creating them.,106,,

1019,0.97,5660.354,5660.621,Thanks.,107,,
1020,0.97,5660.621,5662.256,Thank you for having me.,107,,
1021,0.97,5662.256,5667.461,I'm one of the founders and Co-Ceo of Dumplin.,107,,
1022,0.97,5667.461,5679.373,Our big goal is to really level the Player field for workers in the gig economy through an ownership model for the grocery delivery businesses.,107,,
1023,0.97,5679.373,5686.714,"The personal shoppers can set their own prices, work with the complaints they want to work with.",107,,
1024,0.97,5686.714,5692.286,And they earn significantly more money per shop than the traditional on demand Apps.,107,,
1025,0.97,5692.286,5698.225,"We currently support over 2,000 personal shoppers across the U.S. in all 50 States.",107,,
1026,0.97,5698.225,5707.568,"And when we first founded Dumpling almost five years ago, one of the big goals was to elevate the voice of workers.",107,,
1027,0.97,5707.568,5710.204,"And specifically workers, the working class.",107,,
1028,0.97,5710.204,5726.687,"What we didn't expect was how many independent contractors, specifically in the gig economy, were going to really voice huge concerns about feeling underpaid, exploited, and undervalued by the on demand Apps in the gig economy.",107,,
1029,0.97,5726.687,5736.597,So we quickly started to really focus to understand what was going on and learn about how traditional employment law was being side stepped.,107,,
1030,0.97,5736.597,5750.411,"When you remove the hr departments and laws and start to manage people by allege rhythms and reduce them to a Cog in the wheel, it exploits the workers.",107,,
1031,0.97,5750.411,5765.192,"We wanted to understand what was going on and build a company and a model to centered the worker, the people doing so much of the work and making the fast Industries grow and build something that works for them and allows them to do the great work they're doing.",107,,
1032,0.97,5765.192,5777.004,"Listening in on the call today and hearing so many people from working Washington to all of the different App-Based workers call in and explain and share their experiences, they are not the exception.",107,,
1033,0.97,5777.004,5785.546,And some of the horrifying things that we heard about pay and how pay gets removed really are kind of a standard.,107,,
1034,0.97,5785.546,5799.927,"So what really exciting me about the opportunity to work with the team and the city council is to be able to share the experiences that I have learned, that our team has learned about kind of the tricks that a lot of the companies do.",107,,
1035,0.97,5799.927,5805.833,How they kind of work around so many of the things and really exploit workers.,107,,
1036,0.97,5805.833,5820.848,"As well as, you know, the other things that we have learned in terms of what's helpful after people and what are the types of things to help them do the essential work that has carried us through the pandemic.",107,,
1037,0.97,5820.848,5830.224,And to do so in a way that allows them to create value and build wealth and ultimately make a good and fair amount of the money that's going in from the work that they're doing.,107,,
1038,0.97,5830.224,5831.725,Úappreciate the time.,107,,
1039,0.97,5831.725,5834.295,And it's nice to be here.,107,,
1040,0.97,5834.428,5835.763,Very inspiring.,108,,
1041,0.97,5835.763,5837.698,Thank you very much.,108,,
1042,0.97,5837.698,5839.667,"And thank you for much, Kerem, for the overview.",108,,
1043,0.97,5839.667,5850.211,And we will have the chance to hear in a minute more about that Lsac has been doing and the recommendations.,108,,
1044,0.97,5850.211,5856.417,Are you any questions for Mr. Shapiro?,108,,
1045,0.97,5856.417,5856.917,An extensive background.,108,,
1046,0.97,5856.917,5857.384,Really impressive.,108,,
1047,0.97,5857.384,5858.886,Vice chair Herbold?,108,,
1048,0.97,5858.886,5859.019,.,108,,
1049,0.97,5859.019,5861.021,Not a question.,109,,
1050,0.97,5861.021,5878.372,"Just an expression of my appreciation, Joel, for seeing that there is an Exploitive model that has elements to that Exploitive model that appeals to people.",109,,
1051,0.97,5878.372,5896.09,And finding a way to offer a different model that still has those benefits for workers that workers are Seekin without the Exploitive elements and allowing workers to empower themselves.,109,,
1052,0.97,5896.09,5902.396,I really feel that's incredibly visionary and look forward to working with you more and learning more about the work that you do.,109,,
1053,0.97,5902.396,5903.864,Thank you.,109,,
1054,0.97,5903.998,5904.298,Thank you.,110,,

1060,0.97,5914.875,5926.02,"Thank you, again, for your interest in serving on this board and for the history that you have been bringing to the discussions and the incredible work you have done in the past.",111,,

1080,0.97,5968.562,5968.896,Thank you.,125,,
1081,0.97,5968.896,5969.263,It is unanimous.,125,,
1082,0.97,5969.263,5969.53,Thank you.,125,,
1083,0.97,5969.53,5977.137,"And you don't have to be present, but we will take your motion to the April 12th city council meeting.",125,,
1084,0.97,5977.137,5986.88,The motion has carried and the committee recommendation will be discussed there on April 12th at the city council meeting for a final vote.,125,,
1085,0.97,5986.88,5987.214,Thanks again.,125,,
1086,0.97,5987.214,5990.284,And this conversation will continue on the issues.,125,,
1087,0.97,5990.284,5992.019,Let's move to item four.,125,,
1088,0.97,5992.019,5994.588,Please read it into the record.,125,,
1089,0.97,5994.722,6000.527,Transparency requirements for contract workers for briefing and discussion.,126,,
1090,0.97,6000.661,6002.663,"Thank you very much, Madame clerk.",127,,
1091,0.97,6002.663,6014.875,"And we still have with us Liz Ford, gay Gill mother, members of the labor standards advisory Commission.",127,,
1092,0.97,6014.875,6015.175,Karina Bull.,127,,
1093,0.97,6015.175,6019.88,"And Mr. Shapiro, you are welcome to stay.",127,,
1094,0.97,6019.88,6020.614,I know you are busy.,127,,
1095,0.97,6020.614,6024.618,"If you feel like you have to leave, no offense taken.",127,,
1096,0.97,6024.618,6029.69,Excited to have you here and participate as well.,127,,
1097,0.97,6029.69,6034.795,Let us turn it over to you all to talk about what we're doing here.,127,,
1098,0.97,6034.795,6045.139,"And before we do, I would like to ask Councilmember Herbold if you have opening comments as a reminder of what we're doing here today and the conversations that are to come?",127,,
1099,0.97,6045.272,6048.542,Thank you.,128,,
1100,0.97,6048.542,6049.009,You're so kind.,128,,
1101,0.97,6049.009,6054.047,You're kind to give me an opportunity to say a few words.,128,,
1102,0.97,6054.047,6074.501,"You're especially kind to make time in your committee to discuss this issue as I think folks know, it's a legacy issue for me from when once upon a time, I had the office of labor standards in my committee.",128,,
1103,0.97,6074.501,6092.753,"During that period of time, I was really interested in exploring the definitions of what is considered a misclassified worker and what is somebody considered an employee.",128,,
1104,0.97,6092.753,6117.511,"And I was feeling at the time that more and more of the work force was being misclassified as contract employees and thus not entitled to the growing number of workers rights that we were, along with workers, fighting to pass in our city.",128,,
1105,0.97,6117.511,6121.215,"So on one hand, we were increasing workers' rights for employees.",128,,
1106,0.97,6121.215,6134.495,"On the other hand, more and more people were being classified, I believe, misclassified, as contract workers and not being able to benefit for those increased rights.",128,,
1107,0.97,6134.495,6166.727,"And so--and this is a tension nationally as well, the question of whether or not we make a legal argument or a legislative argument that people who are classified as contractors are--that there's a different test to determine whether or not they're employees or whether or not we just simply extend the rights that we have extended to employees to people who are rightly or wrongly classified as contract workers.",128,,
1108,0.97,6166.727,6194.154,"And so because this national debate has been going on about thousand approach this growing issue, this growing problem, I worked with Council to pass resolution 31863 that called on Lsac to develop recommendations to the Council for how we should address this issue.",128,,
1109,0.97,6194.154,6211.838,"Last May, they sent a memo to Council with recommendations for what they describe as a first modest step forward to create more transparency and access to information among those currently classified as independent contractors.",128,,
1110,0.97,6211.838,6233.226,"And we'll hear more from them about their recommendations, including policy requiring hiring entities to provide independent contractors information so that they can understand the terms of their engagement and determine whether or not those have been satisfied.",128,,
1111,0.97,6233.226,6237.998,And thank you for making the time here.,128,,
1112,0.97,6237.998,6248.742,Many thanks to all the members from Lsac for engaging when the Council asked that you take on the issue with passage of our resolution.,128,,
1113,0.97,6248.742,6257.451,And thank you for being here to present to us today.,128,,
1114,0.97,6257.451,6265.259,For thank you to Kerem and the central staff for taking the time to be here in case there are technical questions.,128,,
1115,0.97,6265.259,6266.093,Thank you very much.,129,,
1116,0.97,6266.093,6279.439,And we do have a memo from the office of--from the Commission to the office of labor standards also in the materials from May 6 of 2020 as a refresher as well.,129,,
1117,0.97,6279.439,6282.175,I'll turn it over to Liz.,129,,
1118,0.97,6282.175,6283.543,"Thank you, vice chair.",129,,
1119,0.97,6283.543,6289.049,We have about 20 minutes for the presentation.,129,,
1120,0.97,6289.049,6291.251,"Around 11:35, we'll try to wrap up.",129,,
1121,0.97,6291.251,6293.72,"Liz, take it away.",129,,
1122,0.97,6293.72,6294.054,Of course.,130,,
1123,0.97,6294.054,6314.341,"Thank you so much for being here and inviting us here to present on the recommendations that we made to Ols in May of 2020, which seems like a lifetime ago, given all that we have been through between then and now.",130,,
1124,0.97,6314.341,6325.218,"So in this very short presentation, I will take some time to introduce the Commission and how we came to this recommendation and describe the basics of it.",130,,
1125,0.97,6325.218,6338.498,"And then I'll turn it over to gay, who will then talk through some of the conference limitations that we recommend and also touch on outreach and enforcement.",130,,
1126,0.97,6338.498,6353.18,"And so let me start by not for so much Councilmembers who I know are very familiar with Lsac, but for anyone listening who doesn't know what Lsac is.",130,,
1127,0.97,6353.18,6368.929,I want to take a second and say the Commission was formed in 2014 as a part of Council's creation of the office of labor standards and it's very innovative approach to enforcement and outreach.,130,,
1128,0.97,6368.929,6383.076,"The idea was to continue to provide a space for business, worker advocates, and community advocates to come together and make recommendations to the office, Council, and the Mayor.",130,,
1129,0.97,6383.076,6394.187,You can see here I just extracted from the ordinance the overall goal of Lsac and how that goal is met.,130,,
1130,0.97,6394.187,6399.292,So the question then is how is the Commission comprised?,130,,
1131,0.97,6399.292,6400.394,It's 15 members total.,130,,
1132,0.97,6400.394,6405.298,Seven of those appointed by the Mayor.,130,,
1133,0.97,6405.298,6406.066,Seven appointed by Council.,130,,
1134,0.97,6406.066,6410.871,And one appointed by the Commission itself.,130,,
1135,0.97,6410.871,6417.11,And you have just confirmed Oirs for which we are grateful and excited to have Joel with us.,130,,
1136,0.97,6417.11,6424.751,"The Commission itself should be roughly equally comprised of business representatives, worker advocates, and community advocates.",130,,
1137,0.97,6424.751,6428.722,I'll show you a visual to give you a sense of who we are right now.,130,,
1138,0.97,6428.722,6440.534,"So this little--this set of logos, really, describes the membership of Commission.",130,,
1139,0.97,6440.534,6448.175,"As of now, it includes the several Mayoral nominees before you in the next several weeks for confirmation.",130,,
1140,0.97,6448.175,6454.514,You can see we're getting there in terms of getting that tide balance.,130,,
1141,0.97,6454.514,6461.154,And then the next question is how do we come to make this recommendation?,130,,
1142,0.97,6461.154,6474.634,"Well, the Commission created actually back in 2018, Councilmember Herbold, as you were thinking about this question of definitions, the Commission created a working group to think about the same thing.",130,,
1143,0.97,6474.634,6489.783,And the composition of the work group is on the left hand side of your slide.,130,,
1144,0.97,6489.783,6492.752,"Mona Smith, myself, Artie, and Anthony Burnette.",130,,
1145,0.97,6492.752,6499.86,That group did the ground work and came up with the recommendation that you have seen and I will describe a little bit.,130,,
1146,0.97,6499.86,6503.296,This is a rough time line.,130,,
1147,0.97,6503.296,6516.71,"So the working group completed its first recommendation in April of 2020, sent it to--approved it, the Commission as a whole considered and approved it in May of 2020.",130,,
1148,0.97,6516.71,6520.914,And we forwarded it on to you in June.,130,,
1149,0.97,6520.914,6525.819,And we are delighted to have this invitation in February.,130,,
1150,0.97,6525.819,6536.93,"The independent contractor working group continues on slightly the composition's changed slightly to include Joel, of course, and also gay.",130,,
1151,0.97,6536.93,6542.402,So the charge from you in the resolution from 2019.,130,,
1152,0.97,6542.402,6542.702,There it is.,130,,
1153,0.97,6542.702,6550.443,Asking us to provide input to Ols on this very difficult question.,130,,
1154,0.97,6550.443,6568.128,"And the--as the working group started on its work, we quickly discovered that it would be important in order for us to achieve consensus to take this in bites.",130,,
1155,0.97,6568.128,6569.529,So we did that.,130,,
1156,0.97,6569.529,6574.367,You're going to see and have seen that our recommendation is targeted.,130,,
1157,0.97,6574.367,6584.978,It is not intended to be mutually exclusive with other means and methods of addressing the Quetion of independent contractor Misclassification and also exploitation.,130,,
1158,0.97,6584.978,6595.655,So one of the things we noticed in the resolution is that one of the whereas clauses led us to the Washington Department of Commerce study.,130,,
1159,0.97,6595.655,6597.09,And we took a look at that.,130,,
1160,0.97,6597.09,6601.595,And there was one thing that jumped out at us quickly.,130,,
1161,0.97,6601.595,6615.408,"That was that this graphic here, which I'll describe in a second, suggested that there's a really basic information gap with independent contractor workers.",130,,
1162,0.97,6615.408,6625.185,"The top line, that red line, indicates the 1099 filings, the sort of percentage of 1099 filings.",130,,
1163,0.97,6625.185,6630.256,The bottom two lines are Self-Reported status.,130,,
1164,0.97,6630.256,6632.158,How do people support themselves?,130,,
1165,0.97,6632.158,6633.426,There's a major gap there.,130,,
1166,0.97,6633.426,6642.135,"If workers are not even sure if they're independent contractors, it was likely to us that they lacked other really basic information.",130,,
1167,0.97,6642.135,6646.573,"And in fact, we knew this to be true from our own experience on the task force.",130,,
1168,0.97,6646.573,6664.057,"And we have folks that represent low wage workers in employment claims and folks who organize low wage and gig workers, as well as businesses that interact with independent contractor workers.",130,,
1169,0.97,6664.057,6674.901,"This was consistent with what we believe to be true, which is there is a serious information deficit, especially among low wage independent contractor workers.",130,,
1170,0.97,6674.901,6683.243,So we looked at what's basic information that an employee would be entitled to under Seattle ordinances.,130,,
1171,0.97,6683.243,6683.543,Here it is.,130,,
1172,0.97,6683.543,6688.481,It's the kind of information necessary to look at what was I supposed to be paid.,130,,
1173,0.97,6688.481,6690.817,What was I actually paid?,130,,
1174,0.97,6690.817,6691.851,Do they match?,130,,
1175,0.97,6691.851,6692.786,Who is my employer?,130,,
1176,0.97,6692.786,6695.955,How do I get in touch with them?,130,,
1177,0.97,6695.955,6698.058,What's my rate of pay?,130,,
1178,0.97,6698.058,6699.159,Is there tipping?,130,,
1179,0.97,6699.159,6701.561,Am I paid on Commission?,130,,
1180,0.97,6701.561,6702.629,When should I get paid?,130,,
1181,0.97,6702.629,6709.736,"To compare, on the pay stub, you need a version of that same set of information.",130,,
1182,0.97,6709.736,6722.415,"From that, we thought, well, what seems very sensible to us is to--a policy that requires the same sort of parallel set of information.",130,,
1183,0.97,6722.415,6730.49,Independent contractor workers should be able to understand the terms of their engagement and figure out if they have been paid right.,130,,
1184,0.97,6730.49,6737.63,"And this is, Councilmember Herbold, the piece that you called out at the top.",130,,
1185,0.97,6737.63,6742.202,This is intended to be a first step.,130,,
1186,0.97,6742.202,6742.635,And not a last step.,130,,
1187,0.97,6742.635,6745.105,All right.,130,,
1188,0.97,6745.105,6753.613,So here is the same visual depiction of the independent contractor disclosures we're proposing or recommending.,130,,
1189,0.97,6753.613,6757.617,There is a Precontract set and a time of payment set.,130,,
1190,0.97,6757.617,6759.185,And they look very similar.,130,,
1191,0.97,6759.185,6762.388,With some important distinctions.,130,,
1192,0.97,6762.388,6767.026,"So who is my hiring entity, how do I contact them?",130,,
1193,0.97,6767.026,6769.662,How am I being paid?,130,,
1194,0.97,6769.662,6775.368,"And importantly, what are the typical expenses that will be Unreimbursed?",130,,
1195,0.97,6775.368,6781.841,What should I expect to pay out of my pocket and deduct from how I'm budgeting.,130,,
1196,0.97,6781.841,6782.575,How am I paid?,130,,
1197,0.97,6782.575,6786.779,"Is this a flat rate, what is this?",130,,
1198,0.97,6786.779,6789.082,"If there's tipping, how does that work?",130,,
1199,0.97,6789.082,6791.451,And when do I get paid?,130,,
1200,0.97,6791.451,6795.021,"Time of payment, what did I just get paid for?",130,,
1201,0.97,6795.021,6803.229,That's important in the independent contractor circumstance to us because it could be a per item payment.,130,,
1202,0.97,6803.229,6808.468,What am I being paid for now?,130,,
1203,0.97,6808.468,6812.305,How am I being paid?,130,,
1204,0.97,6812.305,6813.339,Are there tips?,130,,
1205,0.97,6813.339,6814.874,Did you deduct anything?,130,,
1206,0.97,6814.874,6817.21,So that's sort of the basic recommendation.,130,,
1207,0.97,6817.21,6822.649,I'll turn it over to gay to go a little further and talk about some of the details.,130,,
1208,0.97,6822.782,6824.684,"Thanks, Liz.",131,,
1209,0.97,6824.684,6840.9,The jazz of what we're advocating for is of course letting people know what their labor is going for.,131,,
1210,0.97,6840.9,6841.935,In plain English and repeatedly.,131,,
1211,0.97,6841.935,6848.741,"If you're working for someone, you deserve the right to know all of the things that Liz was talking about.",131,,
1212,0.97,6848.741,6858.651,"If you're an employee, an employer relationship, it should be no different if you're an independent contractor and a hiring entity relationship.",131,,
1213,0.97,6858.651,6870.396,We really and truly believe that having this sunlight into what's happening will be the best first step in protecting our most vulnerable workers by standardizing this disclosure.,131,,
1214,0.97,6870.396,6879.372,And it could be that a consequence of not having this proper disclosure means that you're in an assumed employer relationship.,131,,
1215,0.97,6879.372,6886.613,So it kind of UPS the stakes if you're not able to provide this kind of common disclosure.,131,,
1216,0.97,6886.613,6901.461,"So when it comes time to implementing this, right, we were talking originally about exactly how to stop Misclassification.",131,,
1217,0.97,6901.461,6908.568,And I think what we're saying is the first step in the policy is to provide a common disclosure.,131,,
1218,0.97,6908.568,6916.909,"And once we're implements this as actual regulation, there are some additional consequences.",131,,
1219,0.97,6916.909,6933.126,"So outreach and providing some type of standardization, as well as making sure we're not sweeping up people in the legislation that we don't want to is critical.",131,,
1220,0.97,6933.126,6949.842,"Along those terms, we're suggests Ols provide a great Website to walk workers and employers in hiring entities through a Flowchart to determine the relationship they're in and what disclosures are needed in some of the most common cases.",131,,
1221,0.97,6949.842,6954.514,We know what a lot of the common cases are.,131,,
1222,0.97,6954.514,6958.651,As well as making sure that we are not sweeping up certain groups unnecessarily.,131,,
1223,0.97,6958.651,6962.155,"So next slide, Liz.",131,,
1224,0.97,6962.155,6972.365,And actually--Yeah.,131,,
1225,0.97,6972.365,6972.732,There we go.,131,,
1226,0.97,6972.732,6979.305,Some of these coverage limitations are some of the same things in the other Ols regulations.,131,,
1227,0.97,6979.305,6985.578,Making sure that we are not sweeping up just the smallest businesses.,131,,
1228,0.97,6985.578,6992.985,So our suggestion is to cover anyone who is retaining five or more independent contractors on a consistent basis.,131,,
1229,0.97,6992.985,7003.696,"So Obviously, the largest groups of hiring entities like temporary agencies, the Online platform hiring agencies.",131,,
1230,0.97,7003.696,7006.099,Not necessarily bringing in the smallest of businesses.,131,,
1231,0.97,7006.099,7011.437,"Like wise, we don't want to sweep in some of the short-term contractors.",131,,
1232,0.97,7011.437,7024.717,"Even an individual like myself, hiring a plumber or the relationship I have with a hair stylist, some of these things, you know, these are independent contractor relationships, but we don't want to sweep them up under this legislation.",131,,
1233,0.97,7024.717,7028.02,This is not what we're trying to protect against.,131,,
1234,0.97,7028.02,7041.134,"On the other side, we don't want to sweep in some of the largest but not vulnerable workers who are typically in independent contractor relationships.",131,,
1235,0.97,7041.134,7045.705,"And our suggestion is anybody making over $75,000 a year.",131,,
1236,0.97,7045.705,7056.015,The goal is at the baseline is to provide all workers of their rights while protecting the most vulnerable workers from--at the same time.,131,,
1237,0.97,7056.015,7058.151,"Next slide, Liz.",131,,
1238,0.97,7058.151,7065.258,"So with that, we have to think through enforcement.",131,,
1239,0.97,7065.258,7066.759,We're the labor standards advisory Commission.,131,,
1240,0.97,7066.759,7068.728,We advise the office of labor standards.,131,,
1241,0.97,7068.728,7074.467,What they do is a lot of enforcement and outreach and education.,131,,
1242,0.97,7074.467,7080.44,These are some additional suggestions that we made.,131,,
1243,0.97,7080.44,7084.277,"Unlike other labor standards, this only requires notice.",131,,
1244,0.97,7084.277,7090.082,We're talking about being Upfront with the workers and repeatedly informing them about what they're doing.,131,,
1245,0.97,7090.082,7098.224,"We talk about it as having a nutritional Fax box around your labor contract, what you're getting paid for.",131,,
1246,0.97,7098.224,7100.793,It should be very clear and easy to understand.,131,,
1247,0.97,7100.793,7109.469,"If we can put it on every packaged food, we should be able to put it on every worker and give them the rights they deserve.",131,,
1248,0.97,7109.469,7117.41,"So with this, because it is only notice, we have to be careful because there will be unique enforcement models around it.",131,,
1249,0.97,7117.41,7122.582,"And of course, we are going to have to do a ton of outreach and education.",131,,
1250,0.97,7122.582,7131.557,"As Liz was mentioning, we have people who don't realize that they are in an independent contractor relationship with their company.",131,,
1251,0.97,7131.557,7149.041,"So this is going to require a lot more outreach to the workers, the hiring entities, as well as even individuals who will now worry that they might be being swept into this labor standard.",131,,
1252,0.97,7149.041,7152.178,"So, you know, there's going to be some implications to it.",131,,
1253,0.97,7152.178,7158.885,"One thing in summary, we of course, our whole Commission is about protecting workers.",131,,
1254,0.97,7158.885,7165.258,I was very moved by the public comment at the opening of this meeting.,131,,
1255,0.97,7165.258,7171.631,"And, you know, we think transparency is a key foundation to protecting workers' rights.",131,,
1256,0.97,7171.631,7179.772,"And we believe that as more and more people become independent contractors, they deserve this same sort of protection.",131,,
1257,0.97,7179.772,7206.499,"And this is a critical first step in enabling people to understand what their labor is, understand what the expenses are, figure out how they're going to be paid so they can take action when things are not--when they are not getting what they deserve, what was disclosed to them so that they can have some action or work with us or the office of labor standards to come back on enforcing that.",131,,
1258,0.97,7206.499,7213.472,"Liz, back to you if you have anything else you wanted to say in summary ..",131,,
1259,0.97,7213.472,7216.075,Thanks so much for giving us this opportunity.,132,,
1260,0.97,7216.075,7218.344,We welcome any questions if you have them.,132,,
1261,0.97,7218.477,7225.518,"Councilmember Herbold, anything in closing?",133,,
1262,0.97,7225.518,7239.966,"Just curious, you touched upon the fact that a policy like this would benefit from a unique enforcement approach.",134,,
1263,0.97,7239.966,7263.756,I'm just wondering have you--do you have thoughts about what that would look like and whether or not there would be penalties and fines and how those might be sought by an aggrieved contractor?,134,,
1264,0.97,7263.756,7263.99,Yeah.,135,,
1265,0.97,7263.99,7266.926,"So Councilmember Herbold, we have conversations about that.",135,,
1266,0.97,7266.926,7273.199,"Actually, you can see in the recommendation itself, we didn't make specific recommendations on That.But we have discussed it S.",135,,
1267,0.97,7273.199,7276.135,And there were a couple of key principles about it.,135,,
1268,0.97,7276.135,7291.651,One is that we want to make sure that at least with this targeted proposal that we are not creating an insurmountable burden on the officer of labor standards without matching that with resources.,135,,
1269,0.97,7291.651,7297.79,Recognize that and emphasize the outreach.,135,,
1270,0.97,7297.79,7301.027,"In terms of enforcement, a couple of pieces.",135,,
1271,0.97,7301.027,7309.802,One is we would envision sort of a almost like a parking ticket.,135,,
1272,0.97,7309.802,7316.142,"A limited investigation citation process that--with the possibility, I suppose, of an appeal.",135,,
1273,0.97,7316.142,7317.276,Just very Limiteded citation process.,135,,
1274,0.97,7317.276,7328.12,"More of the point, and you have this already in the employment context, if you create--I'm going to sound like a lawyer.",135,,
1275,0.97,7328.12,7337.797,"If you create an Evidentiary presumption that if you fail to give this notice, what the worker says is presumed to be true.",135,,
1276,0.97,7337.797,7344.804,"So for example, if I am hanging dry wall for Joe's dry wall, Joe didn't give me any disclosures.",135,,
1277,0.97,7344.804,7347.473,I thought the terms were $50 an hour.,135,,
1278,0.97,7347.473,7350.843,Joe thought the terms were $40 an hour.,135,,
1279,0.97,7350.843,7357.616,"When we end up in small claims court, is judge has no choice but to accept my version of the facts.",135,,
1280,0.97,7357.616,7360.853,So that's a way that you could make it Self-Enforceable.,135,,
1281,0.97,7360.853,7363.089,Those are a couple of ideas we have talked about.,135,,
1282,0.97,7363.089,7366.425,The third is the one that gay mentioned.,135,,
1283,0.97,7366.425,7370.463,"If you fail to give the notice, you're presumed to be an employer.",135,,
1284,0.97,7370.463,7372.798,"Anything you want to add, gay?",135,,
1285,0.97,7372.798,7372.998,Okay.,135,,
1286,0.97,7373.132,7377.903,Yeah.,136,,
1287,0.97,7377.903,7379.405,I caught that.,136,,
1288,0.97,7379.405,7382.441,That's a really interesting concept.,136,,
1289,0.97,7382.441,7408.067,"It creates a deterrent effect, I think, for those who are operating as a contractor employer for the purpose of avoiding the rights and responsibilities of an employer to their employees.",136,,
1290,0.97,7408.067,7410.736,That's I think an interesting concept that I hadn't considered.,136,,
1291,0.97,7410.736,7414.206,But really appreciate that.,136,,
1292,0.97,7414.206,7425.05,May I ask one more question?,136,,
1293,0.97,7425.05,7427.453,Yes.,137,,
1294,0.97,7427.453,7432.892,So we I think you acknowledged listening to public comment today.,138,,
1295,0.97,7432.892,7458.651,"We heard testimony from folks supporting what's being called a Payup policy campaign that includes a minimum pay that guarantees workers make more than a minimum wage after expenses, makes clear that tips are on top, protecting flexibility, has transparency recommendations as well as.",138,,
1296,0.97,7458.651,7508.901,"And just interested to hear from Lsac how the recommendations you're making today can lead us toward having that other next important discussion around the--not just the transparency around the remuneration that workers receive for their labor, but regulating some of our expectations in a way that ensures that it's not continuing to be an Exploitive model.",138,,
1297,0.97,7509.201,7509.735,.,138,,
1298,0.97,7514.573,7516.141,I can take a stab at that.,139,,
1299,0.97,7516.141,7520.512,One of the things we heard was that transparency is really important.,139,,
1300,0.97,7520.512,7533.025,"And specifically for workers in the gig economy, it's often times a black box algorithm with no idea of what's used to calculate their actual pay.",139,,
1301,0.97,7533.025,7535.261,That often times is changed constantly.,139,,
1302,0.97,7535.261,7564.023,"I think part of the goal here is if we can provide transparency and a vehicle for transparency to get that in writing and get that down, I think then future steps of looking at what is pay, does that match kind of the Payup legislation and ideas, is there a mismatch there, I think will help moving forward to really understand what are the terms of the pay, is it below minimum wage, should it be more, how are expenses calculated?",139,,
1303,0.97,7564.023,7574.6,This is a first step to be able to enforce as well as just more clearly articulate the expectations and accountability for meeting those.,139,,
1304,0.97,7574.733,7576.101,Thank you very much.,140,,
1305,0.97,7576.101,7584.343,So we will have the opportunity to have this topic again in the committee I believe the next meeting and the meeting after that.,140,,
1306,0.97,7584.343,7589.348,Thank you for Teeing this up and all of you for being with us.,140,,
1307,0.97,7589.348,7590.549,Thank you very much.,141,,
1308,0.97,7590.683,7596.121,You're welcome.,142,,
1309,0.97,7596.121,7598.09,We appreciate you all being there.,142,,
1310,0.97,7598.09,7602.361,And thanks for walking us through the item.,142,,
1311,0.97,7602.494,7615.741,I just want to be transparent in Thattive been working with Karina on draft legislation to implement the recommendations of Lsac in this area.,143,,
1312,0.97,7615.741,7634.193,"But I am, as always, open to working with members of this committee if there are steps that we want to take toward the recommendation of the Payup campaign within the context of this bill.",143,,
1313,0.97,7634.193,7644.236,Or perhaps we want to create some expectations for ourselves within the context of this bill for next steps around the Payup proposals.,143,,
1314,0.97,7644.236,7659.051,"I'm open to how we might do that, understanding there is a lot of overlap between the recommendations that we have before us today from Lsac and what we are hearing from gig workers.",143,,
1315,0.97,7659.051,7680.239,"And I just want to highlight that, you know, even though I have been working on a bill that focused on these particular recommendations, I'm open to working with you to address some of the issues that we have heard today in public comment.",143,,
1316,0.97,7680.239,7680.506,Thank you.,143,,
1317,0.97,7680.506,7684.777,Thank you.,144,,
1318,0.97,7684.777,7687.88,We will follow up Offline about that.,144,,
1319,0.97,7687.88,7688.313,"Thanks, everyone.",144,,
1320,0.97,7688.313,7688.914,Great to see you.,144,,
1321,0.97,7688.914,7689.481,Appreciate your time today.,144,,
1322,0.97,7689.481,7692.951,And we will see you very soon.,144,,
1323,0.97,7692.951,7693.152,Okay.,144,,
1324,0.97,7693.152,7698.39,Could you read item five into the record?,144,,
1325,0.97,7698.39,7700.559,.,144,,
1326,0.97,7700.559,7705.164,Counsel bill 120018.,145,,
1327,0.97,7705.164,7712.871,"An ordinance related to grant funds from Noncity sources for briefing, discussion, and possible vote.",145,,
1328,0.97,7712.871,7713.205,Excellent.,146,,

1330,0.97,7727.119,7730.589,Thank you for being with us.,146,,
1331,0.97,7730.589,7736.595,This bill was discussed in our last committee.,146,,
1332,0.97,7736.595,7742.101,This is tied to the December 2020 Covid relief bill that Congress passed.,146,,
1333,0.97,7742.101,7753.245,This is our opportunity here in city council finally to have the conversation we had been long anticipating that legislation was transmitted to us just before our last committee meeting.,146,,
1334,0.97,7753.245,7773.665,And we now have the opportunity to really walk through the proposal amendments in front of us and I ask that we go through the presentation and go ahead and save questions and comments specific for each of the amendments as we have them.,146,,
1335,0.97,7773.665,7776.368,"Traci, do you have a presentation?",146,,
1336,0.97,7776.368,7776.668,I do.,147,,
1337,0.97,7776.668,7777.002,Very briefly.,147,,
1338,0.97,7777.002,7778.537,I will start to share my screen here.,147,,
1339,0.97,7778.537,7811.87,"I am joined by my central staff colleagues Brian goodnight and Eric Mcconaughey, who are knowledge able about the programs should questions come up about the programs in light of the legislation that does include utility funding.",147,,
1340,0.97,7811.87,7823.916,"As you indicated, Councilmember Mosqueda, there was an initial presentation discussion of Council bill 120018 to allocate $22 million of Federal funds for rental and utility assistance.",147,,
1341,0.97,7823.916,7836.094,"On Thursday of last week, I E-Mailed to the Councilmembers a memo that provided a summary of the legislation and the three proposed amendments we discussed in the meeting.",147,,
1342,0.97,7836.094,7851.243,"So just very briefly, to remind you, $22 million allocated, proposed to be allocated consistent with the way that we allocated about $9 million of rental assistance that the city received last year.",147,,
1343,0.97,7851.243,7856.181,Proposed uses include rent and utility assistance.,147,,
1344,0.97,7856.181,7862.487,"Eligibility criteria, again, people qualify for unemployment and experienced a reduction of household income.",147,,
1345,0.97,7862.487,7870.462,A risk of experiencing homelessness or housing stability and income at or below 80% of median income.,147,,
1346,0.97,7870.462,7882.407,"Eligible costs, 90% has to go for direct financial assistance, including rent, utilities, and home.",147,,
1347,0.97,7882.407,7887.379,And up to 10% spent for housing stability services and cost.,147,,
1348,0.97,7887.379,7900.359,"And just to remind us about the ongoing need for rental assistance, the latest poll survey done by the Census Bureau showed that more than 13,000 Seattle Renters are behind on the Renter payments.",147,,
1349,0.97,7900.359,7910.502,"Typical arrears from one and a half to three months or $1,000 to $3,000.",147,,
1350,0.97,7910.502,7922.08,"And there's a disproportionate number of those in the Latino and black households, indicating they are delinquent on the rent payments.",147,,
1351,0.97,7922.08,7930.889,"In allocation, $8 million is proposed to go to the United way to provide rental assistance for low income tenants.",147,,
1352,0.97,7930.889,7932.024,And allow small landlords to apply.,147,,
1353,0.97,7932.024,7941.066,And $7 million to the office of housing for rental assistance for the low income tenants and affordable housing.,147,,
1354,0.97,7941.066,7949.107,$6.2 million to Community-Based organizations to provide rental assistance and support services for the tenants.,147,,
1355,0.97,7949.107,7952.744,And $1.5 million to Seattle city light and public utilities.,147,,
1356,0.97,7953.045,7962.688,That would be used for emergency utility assistance for low income Renters without standing utility bills.,147,,
1357,0.97,7962.688,7970.729,In terms of the proposed amendments--are the questions about the legislation as proposed?,147,,
1358,0.97,7970.729,7976.268,"If you could go back a page, I have a question about the Community-Based organizations.",148,,
1359,0.97,7976.268,7986.411,I think a lot of folks expressed a lot of interest in support with making sure that Cvos get direct cash assistance as your previous slide showed.,148,,
1360,0.97,7986.411,7995.954,Twice as many individuals who are from African American and Latino communities are facing Eviction compared to white counterparts.,148,,
1361,0.97,7995.954,8007.099,The question I have about the CBO Allocationover funds is do we have a list of the proposed organizations responsible for dispensing rental assistance?,148,,
1362,0.97,8007.099,8026.351,Is there an oversight process in terms of community individuals directly experiencing Eviction and the organizations who are helping the individuals experiencing Eviction and having a role in providing recommendations and accountability and oversight to make sure that the process is indeed addressing the disparities that we see?,148,,
1363,0.97,8026.351,8031.156,I think I'm going to have Emily from the office of housing respond to that question.,149,,
1364,0.97,8031.289,8064.923,"Councilmembers, so the proposal for the Community-Based organizations is that we will proceed with a really light touch Rfq process, an application process, that would seek to identify Community-Based organizations who have experienced providing rental assistance and who have expertise serving communities who are disproportionately impacted by Covid and by housing instability.",150,,
1365,0.97,8064.923,8084.976,"So for example, we have done a lot of outreach and engagement already with Community-Based organizations because there are rental assistance programs that have been previously run by the human services Department in partnership with the housing levy, with the state, and with the county.",150,,
1366,0.97,8084.976,8089.314,There already are many Community-Based organizations who have done this work.,150,,
1367,0.97,8089.314,8106.598,And we have been talking to groups like bird far place and cheap Seattle Club and housing services as example.,150,,
1368,0.97,8106.598,8118.944,Interim CD a as examples of agencies who Express interest and fit the category of essentially being Bipoc led in rental assistance services.,150,,
1369,0.97,8118.944,8132.924,We'll see how many folks apply through that process with the goal of turning it around very quickly and allowing them to have the maximum flexibility as allowed by the Federal guidelines to then administer those resources on behalf of their community.,150,,
1370,0.97,8133.225,8136.161,.,150,,
1371,0.97,8137.996,8138.163,Okay.,151,,
1372,0.97,8138.163,8138.63,Thank you very much.,151,,
1373,0.97,8138.63,8138.997,That's helpful.,151,,
1374,0.97,8138.997,8162.22,"I know there's a lot of community of Color-Led organizations who stepped in to provide Covid relief during the last year who typically don't provide rental assistance, but stepped into the area because of the trusted relationship they have with black, indigenous, and people of color communities and they wanted to provide the service.",151,,
1375,0.97,8162.22,8180.739,What I'm hearing is that's the type of organization and direct service you're hoping to serve here to make sure that communities of color have the chance to have direct connections funded so that they can provide rental assistance.,151,,
1376,0.97,8180.739,8181.072,"Okay, great.",151,,
1377,0.97,8181.072,8181.473,Council President?,151,,
1378,0.97,8181.473,8185.544,I had a similar line of questioning.,152,,
1379,0.97,8185.544,8188.847,Mine--and I just want to make sure that I understand.,152,,
1380,0.97,8188.847,8198.19,"Because the way I was looking at it was the full $22.7 million, not just the $6.2 million.",152,,
1381,0.97,8198.19,8216.608,"So I want to know how these allocations, regardless of who they're going to, center the needs of those disproportionately impacted by inability to pay rent, which was shown on the previous slide.",152,,
1382,0.97,8216.608,8230.522,So I just want to make sure that the entire $22.7 million is being utilized in a manner that is reflective of the need within our community.,152,,
1383,0.97,8230.522,8243.435,And there is no doubt there's a DIS Proproportionate need in the black and Latino communities.,152,,
1384,0.97,8243.435,8252.611,I don't have a sense of how these dollars are being used to Aline these dollars with that known need.,152,,
1385,0.97,8252.744,8256.848,Thank you for that question.,153,,
1386,0.97,8256.848,8261.353,I think your framing is exactly right.,153,,
1387,0.97,8261.353,8271.363,"We have proposed three different strategies that all seek to achieve the outcomes on focusing and centering on those who have been most impacted, but they do it in different ways.",153,,
1388,0.97,8271.363,8286.177,"So first, I would say that we use the United way program and the office of housing programs previously, and they both did show strong outcomes as it relates to racial equity.",153,,
1389,0.97,8286.177,8295.253,"We have also heard--in terms of demographics served, I should say.",153,,
1390,0.97,8295.253,8298.29,We have heard explicitly that demographics is not sufficient.,153,,
1391,0.97,8298.29,8302.427,So an added strategy of using trusted partners helps to round it out.,153,,
1392,0.97,8302.427,8310.502,But I will say here are a few things that underpin all of the programs that demonstrate their targeting.,153,,
1393,0.97,8310.502,8317.676,"First, United way is working in parallel with the King County program.",153,,
1394,0.97,8317.676,8321.112,And King County is investing significant resources in rent assistance.,153,,
1395,0.97,8321.112,8339.764,"Under that program, they are targeting the AMI s to folks at or below 50% of area median income to ensure we're driving to the lowest income households, which is consistent with the Federal guidelines and national best practices.",153,,
1396,0.97,8339.764,8342.2,And more Overlays with communities of color income.,153,,
1397,0.97,8342.2,8353.211,"Second, for the office of housing, we know that people living in city subsidized housing are also even more lower income than the general population of Renters.",153,,
1398,0.97,8353.211,8358.083,Those folks are at or below 60% AMI already.,153,,
1399,0.97,8358.083,8375.967,"And most of those people served under our last program were at or below 30% of the area median income, many of whom disproportionately in the portfolio are represented by people of color.",153,,
1400,0.97,8375.967,8384.542,"Both United way and office of housing, we are also working with Community-Based organizations.",153,,
1401,0.97,8384.542,8394.986,"Ewe United way contracts with urban League and solid ground and well spring and neighborhood house, who all have community connections through our office of housing.",153,,
1402,0.97,8394.986,8406.331,"We will be providing support for largely nonprofit landlords what are also Community-Based organizations like community roots housing, he high, interim, and others.",153,,
1403,0.97,8406.331,8414.606,"So I do believe that there's an underpinning of driving those outcomes across the strategies, but they do it in different ways.",153,,
1404,0.97,8414.739,8435.827,"Councilmember, we have--to support what Emily is talking about, we have a report provided to us that shows the demographic break down of those helped by the office of housing and United way and Hsds, contractors from the last round of resources, the $9.9 million.",154,,
1405,0.97,8435.827,8438.73,Just to support what Emily is saying.,154,,
1406,0.97,8438.73,8438.997,Great.,155,,
1407,0.97,8438.997,8439.397,Thank you so much.,155,,
1408,0.97,8439.531,8442.3,Thank you very much.,156,,
1409,0.97,8442.3,8455.947,"And director, one other thing that we can get more information from you about Offline is how referrals are processed either at the city or with United way.",156,,
1410,0.97,8455.947,8471.596,"One of the questions I had been receiving is how did community organizations who provided referrals know that they have processed, received assistance, and what is the follow through, especially with the community of Color-Led organizations making the referrals.",156,,
1411,0.97,8471.596,8479.571,"Obviously, not everyone is going to be able to be served by the Community-Based organization allocation that we're considering today.",156,,
1412,0.97,8479.571,8487.579,There will continue to be referrals to United way and office of housing in making sure there's a closing of the Loop with the groups is important.,156,,
1413,0.97,8487.579,8488.78,We can talk about that Offline.,156,,
1414,0.97,8488.78,8490.248,Unless you have an answer right now.,156,,
1415,0.97,8490.248,8490.381,.,156,,
1416,0.97,8490.381,8498.189,I would be happy to provide you the information Offline.,157,,
1417,0.97,8498.189,8511.903,"And I would say in addition, we are proposing small scale grants to Community-Based organizations who can help facilitate language access and marking to help people know about the availability of resources.",157,,
1418,0.97,8511.903,8526.718,"We have been working with the organizations through a survey process and now in partnership are helping to provide the language access grants, which we think is another strategy and tool to ensure those equitable outcomes.",157,,
1419,0.97,8526.851,8529.187,Excellent.,158,,
1420,0.97,8529.187,8533.625,Are there any additional questions on the underlined bill.,158,,
1421,0.97,8533.625,8533.825,Okay.,158,,
1422,0.97,8533.825,8534.692,Let's move on into amendments.,158,,
1423,0.97,8534.826,8536.694,Okay.,159,,
1424,0.97,8536.694,8542.3,So moving to amendment number one.,159,,
1425,0.97,8542.3,8553.545,So this amendment would eliminate the $1.5 million proposed for utility assistance and Reallocate the funding to rental assistance programs.,159,,
1426,0.97,8553.545,8562.186,"$750,000 to the United way, bringing the Totem to $8.75 million.",159,,
1427,0.97,8562.186,8563.421,And office of housing.,159,,
1428,0.97,8563.421,8571.829,Attaches to your agenda is version two of the amendment that's different than what I sent you last week in the memo.,159,,
1429,0.97,8571.829,8578.636,I left out a section of the introduction section.,159,,
1430,0.97,8578.636,8586.277,There is language that talked about the the grant acceptance and the amendment strikes that grant acceptance language as well.,159,,
1431,0.97,8586.277,8598.623,It is a technical cleanup and backs up the existing appropriation language which strikes the appropriation for those two departments and then Reallocating the funding to the other two entities.,159,,
1432,0.97,8598.756,8599.057,Great.,160,,
1433,0.97,8599.057,8606.864,"If we want to do this, maybe we'll pause on each one of the amendments and consider them as we go forward.",160,,
1434,0.97,8606.864,8607.065,Great.,160,,
1435,0.97,8607.065,8617.175,"Just to add a little bit of additional context to amendment number one, this is version two we have in front of you.",160,,
1436,0.97,8617.175,8628.553,The American rescue plan act adopted this year provides an additional $22 billion more funding emergency rental assistance and can be used for things like rent and utilities.,160,,
1437,0.97,8628.553,8639.03,It is likely that the city of Seattle is going to get a direct allocation of the funds in addition to the $23 million allocated by Congress last December.,160,,
1438,0.97,8639.03,8647.972,This would give us additional flexibility provided to both in terms of relief for rental assistance and can be used for utility relief.,160,,
1439,0.97,8647.972,8654.912,"This can also be used for commercial rate payers, which will be necessary to help small businesses make it through the remainder of the emergency.",160,,
1440,0.97,8654.912,8659.15,We're awaiting final word on the amount and timing from the Federal Government.,160,,
1441,0.97,8659.15,8670.428,I wanted to flag for folks there is additional assistance specifically for utility assistance and rental assistance forth coming.,160,,
1442,0.97,8670.428,8680.805,There's $4.5 billion in funding that can cover things like heating and cooling bills and repairs of heating systems for homeowners and Renters.,160,,
1443,0.97,8680.805,8689.18,And the program is able to serve households at 150% of below the Federal poverty level.,160,,
1444,0.97,8689.18,8704.695,"This is a great example of where we can continue to see additional support for not only providing direct payment assistance for rent, but additional assistance for those who need help covering the cost of utilities.",160,,
1445,0.97,8704.695,8709.7,Arpa provides $500 million in assistance for the water customers as well.,160,,
1446,0.97,8709.7,8711.135,There's additional support coming for that.,160,,
1447,0.97,8711.135,8714.672,"Again, information is forth coming about how the program will be administered.",160,,
1448,0.97,8714.672,8719.41,And the strategies for how cities can access the dollars.,160,,
1449,0.97,8719.41,8727.085,This is an important element to consider that was not available whether when the bill was initially being drafted.,160,,
1450,0.97,8727.085,8735.026,We did send a memo out last Thursday to colleagues including the proposed changes here.,160,,
1451,0.97,8735.026,8741.766,I understand that the public utility departments have raised concerns about desiring the $1.5 million here.,160,,
1452,0.97,8741.766,8755.713,"My intent with the legislation in front of us is to make sure that every dollar, as the Council President said, every dollar of the $22.7 million gets to the hands of those who need rental assistance.",160,,
1453,0.97,8755.713,8764.522,"And given the additional information we have received since the drafting of the legislation, the possibility for there to be additional utilities assistance.",160,,
1454,0.97,8764.522,8785.943,"In my understanding, state legislation, which has prevented individuals from being evicted for failure to pay utilities, if we look at the hire Ark can I of needs, we need to help pay the rental assistance and helping to keep roofs over people's head.",160,,
1455,0.97,8785.943,8797.321,"The amendment that the Councilmembers are bringing forward, both in the vein of trying to get as much out the door as possible to keep roofs over people's head.",160,,
1456,0.97,8797.321,8809.534,"I appreciate there is a need to expand the utility discount program, when I am a supporter of and will continue to be.",160,,
1457,0.97,8809.534,8819.277,I think that the $22.7 million today really provides us with the direct opportunity to get the dollars into the hands of people who need it to keep roofs over their head.,160,,
1458,0.97,8819.277,8826.851,I would love to have your support as we look at the possibility of Directy allocating all of the dollars.,160,,
1459,0.97,8826.851,8829.12,Even $1.5 million was not enough.,160,,
1460,0.97,8829.12,8836.027,I'm hoping the future Federal assistance will provide the sufficient amount that the utilities need to deal with back rent.,160,,
1461,0.97,8836.027,8847.271,"Again, looking forward to doing everything we can to make sure at that they have additional support as we try to get dollars out the door.",160,,
1462,0.97,8847.271,8848.439,Are there questions?,160,,
1463,0.97,8848.439,8851.409,I haven't moved it yet.,160,,
1464,0.97,8851.409,8852.61,Just the discussion phase.,160,,
1465,0.97,8852.61,8853.01,Should I do that?,160,,
1466,0.97,8853.01,8853.211,Okay.,160,,
1467,0.97,8853.211,8858.149,Let's put the bill in front of us so that we can move the amendment.,160,,
1468,0.97,8858.149,8862.353,My goodness.,160,,
1469,0.97,8862.353,8870.861,"To get this bill directly in front of us and to consider the amendments, I move the committee recommends passage of the bill.",160,,
1470,0.97,8870.861,8874.899,Is there a second?,160,,
1471,0.97,8874.899,8875.499,Second.,161,,
1472,0.97,8875.499,8876.267,Thank you very much.,162,,
1473,0.97,8876.267,8879.37,The bill is in front of us officially.,162,,
1474,0.97,8879.37,8882.974,"And I described amendment one, version two.",162,,
1475,0.97,8882.974,8893.317,I move the committee amend Council bill 120018 as presented in amendment number one version two.,162,,
1476,0.97,8893.317,8895.219,Is there a second?,162,,
1477,0.97,8895.219,8895.553,Okay.,162,,
1478,0.97,8895.553,8896.654,Thank you very much.,162,,
1479,0.97,8896.654,8897.288,Moved and Seconded.,162,,
1480,0.97,8897.288,8901.225,And now amendment number one is in front of us.,162,,
1481,0.97,8901.225,8901.993,Councilmember Herbold?,162,,
1482,0.97,8901.993,8902.593,Thank you.,163,,
1483,0.97,8902.593,8905.062,I did offer a second so that we could discuss this further.,163,,
1484,0.97,8905.062,8906.497,I'm on the fence about this.,163,,
1485,0.97,8906.797,8946.504,"One of the ways that I'm seeing this is with the current Eviction moratorium in place, we know that water is not being shut off.",163,,
1486,0.97,8946.504,8949.44,Electricity is not being shut off.,163,,
1487,0.97,8949.44,8952.576,And Evictions are not happening because of failure to pay those.,163,,
1488,0.97,8952.576,8965.289,"However, for example, if someone doesn't have the ability to pay their Internet, which we will talk about in a second, and they can't keep their job, it's likely they're not able to pay rent.",163,,
1489,0.97,8965.289,8971.128,"For me, it's about the direct dollars going directly to payments for rental assistance.",163,,
1490,0.97,8971.128,8984.108,"And with the new information that the Federal dollars are able to--the forgot coming Federal dollars for Arpa, which we will discuss soon, will be able to go to utility assistance.",163,,
1491,0.97,8984.108,8994.685,My thought is we use all of the $22.7 million allocated in December's Federal allocation and try to put that to rental assistance.,163,,
1492,0.97,8994.685,8998.189,Further questions?,163,,
1493,0.97,8998.322,9014.839,"My question was given that we are in an Eviction moratorium, so people are not being evicted for not paying rent, but they are acquiring the bills.",164,,
1494,0.97,9014.839,9049.64,"And people are not evicted because of nonpayment of utilities, but they're acquiring bills associated with the nonpayment of the utilities, I don't understand why--given what we already know about the large number of people who are struggling paying their utilities that will have a debt that in the future, they could be vulnerable for Eviction because of that debt.",164,,
1495,0.97,9049.64,9075.733,"And from just our limited analysis of the numbers of rate payers that are behind, I'm not--I don't understand why we would not move forward with some of this assistance now, even given our commitment to address utility needs in a subsequent allocation.",164,,
1496,0.97,9075.733,9092.583,"My understanding was, and if there's others on the line that have additional Intel here, my understanding is that the state Legislature changed the law to ensure that the cases of nonpayment, people cannot be evicted for not paying utilities, only for not paying rent.",165,,
1497,0.97,9092.583,9108.199,"According to the data we tried to get from Seattle public utilities and light, no information has been shared related to this issue.",165,,
1498,0.97,9108.199,9121.278,We'll continue to look for additional strategies to help provide them with relief so they can provide back payment of debts from individuals in the utility discount program.,165,,
1499,0.97,9121.278,9137.795,"But that--since those dollars are available in the upcoming Arpa funds, and again, maybe this would have been better to lump together with the Arpa discussion, like King County is doing, since it was delayed from the executives since this did pass in December.",165,,
1500,0.97,9137.795,9143.901,We don't have the opportunity to look at those two chunks of funding together today.,165,,
1501,0.97,9143.901,9158.148,"What I'm suggesting is that instead of doing $1.5 million to the utilities to pay on the back debts, we discuss in the back debts in the discussion forth coming.",165,,
1502,0.97,9158.148,9158.682,That's my thinking here.,165,,
1503,0.97,9158.682,9162.419,Do you have anything else on that?,165,,
1504,0.97,9162.553,9164.788,I don't.,166,,
1505,0.97,9164.788,9169.76,"I don't have knowledge of the legislation that she Referenced, the state legislation.",166,,
1506,0.97,9169.76,9174.265,We'll have to do research on that.,166,,
1507,0.97,9174.265,9174.532,Okay.,167,,
1508,0.97,9174.532,9174.732,Great.,167,,
1509,0.97,9174.732,9180.771,"Councilmember Herbold, I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to talk with you more in detail in advance of the discussion.",167,,
1510,0.97,9180.771,9182.306,That is my thinking.,167,,
1511,0.97,9182.306,9197.188,"And it is true that nonpayment of utilities is no longer considered a reason for an Eviction under nonpayment of rent, but it is considered a reason for Eviction in violation of the rules of your contract.",168,,
1512,0.97,9197.188,9198.389,That might be the distinction.,169,,
1513,0.97,9198.389,9198.589,Okay.,169,,
1514,0.97,9198.589,9205.529,"Council President, did you have a question?",169,,
1515,0.97,9205.529,9209.099,I see that Councilmember Pedersen has his hand up.,170,,
1516,0.97,9209.099,9212.303,I do want to hear from him.,170,,
1517,0.97,9212.303,9217.975,I guess I understand the spirit with which this amendment is being proposed.,170,,
1518,0.97,9217.975,9226.35,"We all have a strong interest, shared interest, in making sure that we have as many dollars available for rental assistance as we can have.",170,,
1519,0.97,9226.35,9257.715,"But I do worry that in doing so, we may be overlooking the fact that, you know, yes, nobody is getting--while it may be true that folks aren't actively having their utilities shut off by city light or Spu in the moment, that doesn't mean that they're not Acuing debt.",170,,
1520,0.97,9257.715,9268.759,"They still--we have waived late fees and fines, but we aren't actually waiving the cost of services.",170,,
1521,0.97,9268.759,9285.909,"So for those households that are unable to pay their light bill and unable to pay their water, you know, sewer, trash bills, the Calculator is ticking and those costs are accumulating in addition to back rent.",170,,
1522,0.97,9285.909,9305.896,So I'm a little worried that we're potentially going to move this bill forward now that makes dollars available now that would be able to be utilized by households for utility assistance and clearing that debt.,170,,
1523,0.97,9305.896,9310.367,I'm a little worried about Punting that down the road to when we have the Arpa dollars.,170,,
1524,0.97,9310.367,9323.814,"But, you know, again, I don't think--I think this is more of an issue of timing.",170,,
1525,0.97,9323.814,9350.574,And I think my preference without knowing more would be to make sure that people still have access to dollars now in order to address accumulated and ongoing Acuing debt related to utility services so that they can sort of be as clear as possible as soon as the Eviction moratoriums end.,170,,
1526,0.97,9350.708,9354.411,"Councilmember Pedersen, did you have something you wanted to add to this?",171,,
1527,0.97,9354.411,9355.946,And thanks again for joining us today.,171,,
1528,0.97,9355.946,9356.647,Thank you.,172,,
1529,0.97,9356.647,9356.814,Yes.,172,,
1530,0.97,9356.814,9366.623,"And even though I'm not a member of the committee, I do appreciate the invitation to speak, especially to amendment number two about Internet.",172,,
1531,0.97,9366.623,9384.041,"And speaking to this, just because I did some research on this when I saw it and talked to central staff and to--we did get that letter from both utilities, Spu and Seattle city light.",172,,
1532,0.97,9384.041,9390.781,And I think all the Councilmembers who spoke are all--everybody is correct in what they are saying.,172,,
1533,0.97,9390.781,9396.954,There's this great need and we all want to keep people in their homes and we're grateful for the Federal dollars.,172,,
1534,0.97,9396.954,9401.291,Now we have to decide how to allocate them and when and how.,172,,
1535,0.97,9401.291,9413.704,"So, you know, I think what the chair said is spot on in terms of the Arpa dollars being available for utility assistance.",172,,
1536,0.97,9413.704,9440.097,"I think even the third bucket to community groups, you know, if somebody is coming in to one of the Community-Based organizations and saying I'm about, you know, I'm having financial difficulties and I need help paying my rent, I need help paying my utilities and Internet, I think there's flexibility at least in how the Federal Government is defining rental assistance broadly to define utilities.",172,,
1537,0.97,9440.097,9443.4,"For the Community-Based bucket, I think there's flexibility for that.",172,,
1538,0.97,9443.4,9449.706,I look forward to the Arpa dollars where Maybe we can allocate more toward utilities then.,172,,
1539,0.97,9449.706,9457.047,"In terms of right now with this bill, I am fine with the amendment.",172,,
1540,0.97,9457.047,9459.716,And also recognize the concerns raised by the utilities.,172,,
1541,0.97,9459.716,9467.591,I think it is a timing issue where we'll be able to address that with Arp a.,172,,
1542,0.97,9467.591,9468.358,Thanks very much.,173,,
1543,0.97,9468.358,9480.504,"And again, I think my thinking here is as you saw on the slide before, there's $3,000 to $5,000 available on average to each family in rental assistance.",173,,
1544,0.97,9480.504,9489.947,"If we take a conservative estimate of how many families could be served by allocating out the $1.5, that's over 700 families served.",173,,
1545,0.97,9489.947,9502.493,"So given the need right now for rental assistance dollars and the fact that there are people without even rental assistance support in hand, this was my attempt to try to get the dollars out.",173,,
1546,0.97,9502.493,9514.004,"Colleagues, this is hard to do without a sense of, you know, what the universe of the Arpa dollars looks like to come.",173,,
1547,0.97,9514.004,9522.613,"But if there is not support for the amendment right now, I am willing to pull it from today's discussion, given the need to keep moving here.",173,,
1548,0.97,9522.613,9525.682,We have two more big items on the agenda.,173,,
1549,0.97,9525.682,9538.996,"I will note that this is going to mean for me, at least, that there is going to need to be a continued heavy emphasis on rental assistance as we look at the Arpa funds to come, which we knew there was going to be.",173,,
1550,0.97,9538.996,9541.064,But underscoring the point even more.,173,,
1551,0.97,9541.365,9544.868,I'm not seeing anybody interested in speaking up.,173,,
1552,0.97,9544.868,9548.405,I am going to go ahead and pull the amendment for today.,173,,
1553,0.97,9548.405,9549.172,Let's move on to amendment number two.,173,,
1554,0.97,9549.473,9550.374,.,173,,
1555,0.97,9560.851,9563.52,And the cost allocated to Community-Based organizations.,174,,
1556,0.97,9563.52,9577.467,They would be working directly with clients to determine the need for assistance relative to the need for rental assistance and will as appropriate be structured in a way to make payments to Internet providers if the assistance is necessary.,174,,
1557,0.97,9577.467,9585.842,And this is sponsored by Councilmember Mosqueda on behalf of Councilmember Pedersen.,174,,
1558,0.97,9585.842,9592.282,I move to amend Council bill 120018 as presented under amendment number two.,175,,
1559,0.97,9592.282,9595.385,Is there a second from our committee members?,175,,
1560,0.97,9595.385,9596.653,Second.,176,,
1561,0.97,9596.653,9597.154,Thank you very much.,177,,
1562,0.97,9597.154,9601.792,"Councilmember Pedersen, would you like to speak to your amendment?",177,,
1563,0.97,9601.792,9609.466,Thank you again for the open invitation for this committee when dealing with these Federal dollars.,178,,
1564,0.97,9609.466,9611.868,"And specifically for this amendment, amendment number two.",178,,
1565,0.97,9611.868,9620.11,I want to the thank your office for working with my legislative aide on this amendment.,178,,
1566,0.97,9620.11,9626.783,"We know that Covid has laid bare the inequities, including the Digital divide.",178,,
1567,0.97,9626.783,9642.599,"And consistent with the Internet and the action plan adopted by the counsel, third degree add Internet that could be funded as part of the assistance allocated by the Community-Based organization bucket of these dollars.",178,,
1568,0.97,9642.599,9657.881,So it's just for that third portion where this would be added as a potential so as residents are meeting with the Community-Based organizations and Articulating what their needs are.,178,,
1569,0.97,9657.881,9665.555,Internet could be part of that because those are provided by private companies that could shut them off.,178,,
1570,0.97,9665.555,9680.504,"As we have learned the hard way during Covid, people are struggling without good Internet connections to pay their bills, to connect to jobs, school, other services such as health care.",178,,
1571,0.97,9680.504,9685.342,This would open up the options for the Community-Based organizations.,178,,
1572,0.97,9685.642,9685.876,.,178,,
1573,0.97,9686.176,9686.777,Thank you very much.,179,,
1574,0.97,9686.777,9698.689,I did have the chance to check in with a handful of folks working right now with making referrals and hopefully will soon be able to do direct rental assistance themselves.,179,,
1575,0.97,9698.689,9715.372,"And some of those organizations who are Bipoc led did say on an individual basis they hear of situations where paying Internet is really critical for folks keeping their job in the work from home environment, let alone, the kids being able to learn.",179,,
1576,0.97,9715.372,9722.045,"If they don't keep their job, they can't keep their home.",179,,
1577,0.97,9722.045,9723.98,There is an important Nexxus there.,179,,
1578,0.97,9723.98,9734.758,And having the ability to make the decisions and having direct contact with the folks in community will make this feasible.,179,,
1579,0.97,9734.758,9739.663,"Look forward to supporting you, Councilmember Pedersen.",179,,
1580,0.97,9739.663,9741.131,Any additional comments on this?,179,,

1582,0.97,9748.638,9751.541,Thank you for bringing the memo forward.,180,,
1583,0.97,9751.541,9753.91,It's a smart amendment to make.,180,,
1584,0.97,9753.91,9760.784,"It doesn't appropriate specific amount of dollars to Internet services as, you know, an eligible cost.",180,,
1585,0.97,9760.784,9771.828,But it does make the important addition to allow for our Community-Based organizations on the ground providing the services to,180,,
1586,0.97,9771.828,9798.355,They can provide Internet service reach as well to Community-Based organizations . This is something they are definitely hearing more of from the folks that they are serving.,181,,
1587,0.97,9798.355,9816.239,It's a great way for community organizations . Thank you to Councilmember Peterson for supporting this.,181,,

1605,0.97,9908.999,9914.304,"Councilmember Herbold, would you like to describe it in more detail?",197,,
1606,0.97,9914.304,9959.849,Sure . I would like to thank Dr. Alvarado for helping with this . It's an unofficial way to add an official benefit . so to sort of a 24 because this not only will help tenants so that we can put a emphasis on reaching landlords who may be at mortgage default . The amendment does not set aside a particular amount of funding for this group and instead ensures that small landlords receive information about rental assistance available to them and to their tenants through the United way of King County.,198,,
1607,0.97,9959.849,9969.426,"As director, they spoke to us on this issue.",198,,

1638,0.97,10153.143,10169.158,"With your approval, hearing no objections, let's do item number 7. I see the Presenters are with us and I appreciate that . Madam clerk, can you please read agenda item 7?",219,,
1639,0.97,10169.158,10179.469,It is 120030.,220,,
1640,0.97,10181.738,10189.445,An ordinance relating to taxation; amending the payroll expense tax on persons engaging in business in Seattle; and bending section 5 .38 .020 of the Seattle municipal code.,220,,
1641,0.97,10189.445,10212.101,"Thank you director Lee for being here as well as the Finance director from administrative services . as a reminder, council bill 120030 is an amendment to the tax legislation passed last year as a result of the long work we did in community with businesses and labor and community partners.",221,,
1642,0.97,10212.101,10215.204,All of that conversation led to the passage of a bill which then leads to Rulemaking.,221,,
1643,0.97,10215.204,10242.899,"Finance and administrative services did a tremendous job of bringing together businesses who would be paid yours of the amended legislation . through that process, we learned there were amended ideas in the Rulemaking process that could make it easier for individuals to pay the amount they owe.",221,,
1644,0.97,10246.569,10250.239,Today we have with a central staff and director Lee who will walk us through this small addition.,221,,
1645,0.97,10250.239,10254.844,"Again, this is in addition to the underlying bill that has an additional method for businesses to calculate their taste payment tax payment.",221,,
1646,0.97,10254.844,10271.227,"They can choose to select the existing method or they can choose this new method, which we are updating with this legislation to allow businesses to allocate employee payroll expenses based on the hours worked in Seattle in relation to the total hours worked.",221,,
1647,0.97,10271.227,10291.481,"To hurdle rate, this is an option for employers . As we heard from the businesses that there are businesses that would like to choose from one or the other . This recognizes the importance of both maintaining the integrity of the legislation and the importance of the legislation.",221,,
1648,0.97,10291.481,10317.073,"I'm happy to bring forward this legislation, as we always say that we are interested in legislating so that if there are needed improvements that we Úcan continue to do that . There is no change to the underlying legislation into the calculations . really, I think it is a straightforward summary . So, Dan, I turn it over to you to see if Tom or Glenn have anything else to add.",221,,
1649,0.97,10317.073,10325.615,Thank you chair Mosqueda . I am the interim director.,222,,
1650,0.97,10325.615,10344.834,"Tom and I provided a central staffing memo linked to your agenda that reviews much of the background that you covered in your opening remarks . As we mentioned, Glenn Lee, the city's finance director is here to provide perspective from the executive.",222,,
1651,0.97,10344.834,10356.813,I think I won't rehash the description of the background context that you established in your opening remarks.,222,,
1652,0.97,10356.813,10402.191,"I will just highlight some of the key elements of the Council bill 120030 that is on your agenda . As you mentioned, the bill would provide an additional method for businesses to use in calculating taxable payroll amounts . specifically, the bill would allow covered businesses to use either the original three-part test that is described in some detail in the central staff memo, or a new methodology, specifically allocating taxable payroll expenses in proportion to the work done by employees, specifically in Seattle, as opposed to work done outside of Seattle.",222,,
1653,0.97,10402.191,10416.706,The only other thing I think I will highlight for the committee is there is potential for some revenue impacts from the change that will be implemented by this bill.,222,,
1654,0.97,10416.706,10448.07,"The 2021 adopted budget relies on $214 million from the Jumpstart Seattle payroll expense tax to support general fund expenditures . Some businesses would likely continue to use the original calculation option and it is possible that others will choose the new option included in the bill, assuming the bill passes.",222,,
1655,0.97,10448.07,10451.24,It is reasonable to assume that businesses will choose the approach with the lowest net cost.,222,,
1656,0.97,10451.24,10465.855,Each business will make that determination after accounting for both the resulting text tax from the options that would be available . also the cost of tracking the time of the employee being in and out of Seattle.,222,,
1657,0.97,10465.855,10529.385,"As a result, a bill could diminish the city's overall payroll tax revenues for 2021 and beyond . But, we do not have enough hard data to update the revenue implications with any level of specificity . and, it is certainly possible there would be no change in the overall tax revenues given that the original estimate of payroll tax revenues and the number of assumptions did not include any specific additional revenue amount from the higher tax rates from the city's largest employers because of a lack of data of how many employers that are covered by employees who work for those largest employers . So, that is what I would provide in terms of staff comments.",222,,
1658,0.97,10529.385,10530.62,I'm certainly available to address questions.,222,,
1659,0.97,10530.62,10533.422,Possibly Glenn would like to make a statement.,222,,
1660,0.97,10533.422,10551.24,"Thank you very much director . director Lee, please go ahead if you have anything else to add . especially on the last point as a potentially evens out . I know that you have had a chance to think through that question as well.",223,,
1661,0.97,10551.24,10552.041,"Yes, thank you.",224,,
1662,0.97,10552.041,10584.774,"Yes, this changes is based on the Rulemaking process . It would allow folks to treat the apportionment of the time their employee spent within the city and the expenses that incur inside the city and outside of the city . in a manner consistent with taxes around the state and others that the city has contemplated before.",224,,
1663,0.97,10584.774,10598.921,"In terms of revenue estimates, the core issue is that the underlying data that all of the staff used was the very best that was available, but it did not explicitly handle the apportionment question.",224,,
1664,0.97,10598.921,10608.497,"So, you know, we are kind of not really clear what's the final revenue numbers would look like from that point of view.",224,,
1665,0.97,10608.497,10615.705,There is the baseline data that did not handle apportionment data effectively at all.,224,,
1666,0.97,10615.705,10622.478,"That has nothing to do with the staff work on either side, but is the nature of the data that we were using did not address this.",224,,
1667,0.97,10622.478,10638.027,"From my perspective, there are longer-term issues with employment shifts and patterns with more toward Telecommuting that will likely swallow up anything related to this particular bill.",224,,
1668,0.97,10638.027,10649.405,"So, we will all work as hard as we can to implement the tax and then look forward to our initial returns to see what is really happening in the economy.",224,,
1669,0.97,10649.405,10680.036,Thank you very much . I do want to reiterate our appreciation for the FAS Rulemaking process and the discussions you had with payers and employers under this existing law . I understand that you are ready to quickly get information out to the same Stakeholder that participated in the Rulemaking so there is not a moment lost as we talk about the individual organizations and what they need to receive.,225,,
1670,0.97,10680.036,10681.871,Any additional comments or questions?,225,,
1671,0.97,10681.871,10682.471,[pause].,225,,
1672,0.97,10682.471,10699.088,"Okay, thank you very much for the Rulemaking and the central staff analysis, I appreciate it . I move the committee recommends passage of Council bill 120030, is there a second.",226,,
1673,0.97,10699.088,10699.488,Second.,227,,
1674,0.97,10699.488,10702.391,"Thank you, are there any thorough comments or questions?",228,,
1675,0.97,10702.391,10707.697,"Hearing none, will the court please read the bill on the passage.",229,,
1676,0.97,10707.697,10713.836,Councilmember Mosqueda.,230,,
1677,0.97,10713.836,10714.27,Aye.,231,,

1680,0.97,10717.907,10719.575,Councilmember Morales question mark,234,,
1681,0.97,10719.575,10725.114,Aye.,235,,
1682,0.97,10725.114,10727.316,"Madam chair, five approved and no oppose.",236,,
1683,0.97,10727.316,10734.123,The bill will be sent to the April 12th city council meeting for a final vote.,237,,
1684,0.97,10734.123,10745.601,"Thank you so much central staff and director, thank you for your ongoing work on these issues related to revenue, I really appreciate it.",238,,
1685,0.97,10745.601,10751.54,"Director, I am sure we will see you again soon, thank you for popping in today.",238,,
1686,0.97,10751.54,10757.913,"Madam clerk, we have a half hour reserve for the discussion on the last item on the agenda.",239,,
1687,0.97,10757.913,10762.251,Let's move to the presentation by reading in agenda item number 6.,239,,
1688,0.97,10762.251,10766.155,It is Council bill 120029.,240,,
1689,0.97,10766.155,10784.34,"In ordinance amended ordinance 126237, which adopted the 2021 budget; changing appropriation to various departments and budget control levels, and for various funds in the budget.",240,,
1690,0.97,10784.34,10787.243,"Wonderful, I see a host of friends from the executive team.",241,,
1691,0.97,10787.243,10793.282,"If I Miss anybody, please let me know . The director from the office of executive and refugee affairs.",241,,
1692,0.97,10793.282,10801.056,The human services Department and Adrian Thompson from the Maher's office.,241,,

1695,0.97,10809.498,10813.302,"It has been a while since I have seen you, director and it's good to see you as well.",241,,
1696,0.97,10813.302,10814.67,Did I Miss anybody?,241,,
1697,0.97,10814.67,10816.572,"Well, thank you very much.",241,,
1698,0.97,10816.572,10828.417,"Council President, you and I have had the chance to sponsor this legislation that was sent to us from the Maher's office last week.",241,,
1699,0.97,10828.417,10832.688,I wanted to see if you have opening comments you would like to share before the panel begins?,241,,
1700,0.97,10832.688,10841.564,"No, I know we are running short on time and so I would be interested in kicking off the discussion so we can have questions and move on with those.",242,,
1701,0.97,10841.564,10845.034,Thank you very much.,243,,
1702,0.97,10845.034,10850.539,"Director noble, are you going to get us started?",243,,
1703,0.97,10850.539,10853.409,"Whoever would like to get us started, you are welcome to start us off.",243,,
1704,0.97,10853.409,10856.312,Thank you.,244,,
1705,0.97,10856.312,10860.149,I am trying to share my screen.,245,,
1706,0.97,10860.149,10869.358,Thank you chair and committee members for the opportunity to present today.,245,,
1707,0.97,10869.358,10872.328,This is the proposal around the response around hate crimes here in the city.,245,,
1708,0.97,10872.328,10906.795,"As many of you know, this past year has been difficult for some of our community that have really faced a lot of hate crime issues and we are trying to figure out ways to address this further with the incident that happened in Atlanta . We have been working closely with the community to figure out what is the best way to provide a response that is Community- based and it is around community capacity building.",245,,
1709,0.97,10906.795,10914.403,We are excited to be here today with a proposal that we believe will help address some of the concerns that have hurt our community.,245,,
1710,0.97,10914.403,10922.912,The Mayor has done walks and Roundtables with many departments and with community members.,245,,
1711,0.97,10922.912,10927.016,And we can do a quick overview of the proposal today.,245,,
1712,0.97,10927.016,10929.518,"And, we will be able to answer any questions that you have.",245,,
1713,0.97,10929.518,10942.631,We will focus on the background of community engagement and what we have heard from the community . Our response was the majority of investments going directly to the community.,245,,
1714,0.97,10942.631,10951.173,"So I'm going to kick this off to doctor, and to do a quick background.",245,,
1715,0.97,10951.173,10952.408,Thank you for having us.,246,,
1716,0.97,10952.408,10977.967,"I am going to do a quick job of the background . The situation, ever since the pandemic, and even before that is really troubling and alarming in the sense that it is a target on the Asian American friends, family and community members.",246,,
1717,0.97,10977.967,10986.675,The hate crime executive order signed February 2020 named the league executive office.,246,,
1718,0.97,10986.675,11010.499,Primarily because our approach to serving the city's management need has been noted in Terri and in practice . one of the cornerstones of our approach has been how the city community recognized a system that is permissive of bias and prejudice is also permissive of potential hate.,246,,
1719,0.97,11010.499,11030.886,"So, we have been, even through the pandemic that has gotten in the way of the aptly active implementation of the executive order, our office has been providing Prevention-Based support for the city during this entire time.",246,,
1720,0.97,11030.886,11059.248,"We should be able to present our annual report in the next couple of weeks to Council which details all the data on the report and the Trainings we have Ported on bystander instrument should and responding to discrimination and also very soon, we will be launching our intelligence work too.",246,,
1721,0.97,11059.248,11067.056,The pandemic's impact on the community is profound on several levels.,247,,
1722,0.97,11067.056,11082.137,There is damage to the communities with acceptance and the way community members are treated.,247,,
1723,0.97,11082.137,11090.145,"Then, there is economic and socioeconomic damage . The hatred is manifesting in actual assaults.",247,,
1724,0.97,11090.145,11102.057,Hate crime incidents are reported through the FBI and through community alliance.,247,,
1725,0.97,11102.057,11104.093,They have reported nearly 4000 cases.,247,,
1726,0.97,11104.093,11110.065,We all also understand the cases are Underreported.,247,,
1727,0.97,11110.065,11119.675,The harm to the community is probably not accurately measured anywhere as well.,247,,
1728,0.97,11119.675,11124.313,"So, that is a quick background.",247,,
1729,0.97,11124.313,11125.08,Is there more needed?,247,,
1730,0.97,11125.08,11126.715,Can I move on?,247,,
1731,0.97,11126.715,11129.618,You can go ahead.,248,,
1732,0.97,11129.618,11160.649,"So, I'm going to invite the director to help present some of the information that we have heard . As I mentioned in the beginning, the Mayor has heard very loud and clear in the community for the past year and greater than that, her commitment is really around how we can provide investment into the community to address the community capacity building.",249,,
1733,0.97,11160.649,11186.475,"Important for both us of a city and with partners of the community with Roundtables and to hear some of the strategies and ideas around this type of proposal before you today . So, some of the engagement has included One-On-One conversations and Roundtable discussions.",249,,
1734,0.97,11186.475,11189.778,Our Department has participated as well through direct outreach and then just preparing for community.,249,,
1735,0.97,11189.778,11201.857,"So, I'm going to turn it over to the director, as well to give a little bit about what she has heard in the community.",249,,
1736,0.97,11201.857,11208.597,"Director, you are on mute.",250,,
1737,0.97,11208.597,11214.369,"Even one year later, I forget.",251,,
1738,0.97,11214.369,11218.073,"So, as Adrian mentioned, the city is always listening.",251,,
1739,0.97,11218.073,11224.813,"Sometimes as an ongoing programmatic function and sometimes personal, myself included.",251,,
1740,0.97,11224.813,11233.822,"I reached out to the folks that I know and you know, just needing to check in with folks to see how they are doing.",251,,
1741,0.97,11233.822,11275.163,"More recently, a little bit more focused conversation about how the city responds to the Anti-Asian hate crimes and bias . There is a little bit also about legislation . What you see here is the first bullet . Some of the departments that have done this include OCR . There was direct engagement with community organizations and another case was hearing about things with the feedback and learning more about what some of the organizations are doing.",251,,
1742,0.97,11275.163,11289.778,"So, with the Korean community service, for example, one question we asked, was, what we not know in the Korean community because of its presence on the northern part of Seattle.",251,,
1743,0.97,11289.778,11294.65,It's kind of on the cusp of the city and that the northern border up there between your superior Seattle in Lynnwood.,251,,
1744,0.97,11294.65,11310.766,"We wanted to understand what that part of the API community was experiencing that was different than what I think a lot of folks often engage and aware of in the Chinatown International district, for example.",251,,
1745,0.97,11310.766,11318.273,Clearly the IDC in the King County coalition which includes community organizations.,251,,
1746,0.97,11318.273,11325.247,"Massage parlor workers, they talked with massage parlor workers directly.",251,,
1747,0.97,11325.247,11340.328,I know some of that feedback was shared with the office of civil rights and the office of labor standards . It is interesting because a lot of the community safety and social services contracts are housed there.,251,,
1748,0.97,11340.328,11349.438,Those are ongoing conversations and specific conversations that I am aware of.,251,,
1749,0.97,11349.438,11361.75,And working directly with a number of community organizations . that includes friends of little Saigon and a few others . and going to the next slide.,251,,
1750,0.97,11361.75,11383.805,"What folks heard is that there is a series of community centered approaches and folks are urging both the city and allies to uphold . If any of these categories are overlapping, I will do my best to talk about each one discreetly.",252,,
1751,0.97,11383.805,11387.943,One is public awareness and education.,252,,
1752,0.97,11387.943,11426.281,"Just overall creating more awareness around the attacks against the communities . Even with the numbers mentioned earlier, there are folks who are not plugged in and aware that these attacks are happening at unprecedented rates unseen before . I am old enough to remember Vincent Chan and having going through activism as a college student around Asian American studies at my campus . and, it just seems like that is an ongoing need for our education.",252,,
1753,0.97,11426.281,11442.831,"But now, some of the education we need and that folks have called for, including I heard from Janice at neighborhood house that we need bystander training so we can all step in and do something when we witness hate and bias.",252,,
1754,0.97,11442.831,11494.049,"That is certainly helpful for the API communities where more people are reluctant to report, or feel that even if they take action that their concerns and experiences won't be taken seriously . around the community led safety pilot programs, we heard very clearly that community organizations and leaders want an opportunity to develop community centered solutions . So, we know, for example that when Donnie Chen was available, that was such a community effort that was centered in community . I know there was a desire to kind of bring some of the work he did into SPD.",252,,
1755,0.97,11494.049,11518.506,"But he saw his work as for the Cid community . I think in his absence that there has been a lot of thought in terms of thinking about how to make that kind of resource available . It is not rooted in SPD and it's not about 9-1-1, but it is a resource people can call if they feel unsafe.",252,,
1756,0.97,11518.506,11524.412,They can call if they need to report an incident and they can call to find out what resources are available.,252,,
1757,0.97,11524.412,11537.125,It goes beyond reporting and it is really more encompassing and in meeting people where they are at through a simple single number.,252,,
1758,0.97,11537.125,11552.24,"It's another way to reach somebody live on the other end of the line . So, there may be other ideas that have Percolated and, so, having some resources to support those community led pilot programs.",252,,
1759,0.97,11552.24,11558.313,And then communication on policing and Anti-Blackness.,252,,
1760,0.97,11558.313,11614.269,"As a member of the a API community, you are probably aware in your own community sending conversations over the dinner table and in your roles as Councilmembers that we really have struggled with and have tried to give a lot of thought to issues of policing equity at those intersections with Anti- blackness . in the API communities, there has been discussion about how are we complicit and how are we allies? there is a strong desire by community leaders to align ourselves with that conversation around police inequity and racial justice . In making sure that any solutions that we move forward with supporting Anti- Asian hate crimes is aligned with those lessons and conversations that we have had.",252,,
1761,0.97,11614.269,11634.189,"Some of those could be under the banner of what people are calling Defund SPD . In other cases, it is just the recognition that what communities really need is more resources . It calls into Úquestion whether those resources should go to other city departments or to SPD?",252,,
1762,0.97,11634.189,11636.992,There are conversations about what that looks like.,252,,
1763,0.97,11636.992,11657.712,And number four is the community capacity for mental health crisis support . This links a little bit to the resource of having a phone number and a resource for the Cid . also other resources to help with the traumatic effects of what we are hearing and seeing.,252,,
1764,0.97,11657.712,11684.472,"I think long-term, just people feeling isolated and not knowing what to do when they encounter Harassment and Anti- Asian incidents . and, wanting to be able to identify more resources to support folks for what happens after they experience an incident.",252,,
1765,0.97,11684.472,11704.692,"Then around policy and advocacy, I think this overlaps with many of the other points that we have heard and the other things that we have heard include looking at K-12 curriculum recommendations.",253,,
1766,0.97,11704.692,11708.697,Certainly the stories in the press that we have heard recently up and attacks against Asian Elders.,253,,
1767,0.97,11708.697,11748.036,"They argue about bullying in schools and hate and those kinds of things are belief is that if we start early and make sure these things are addressed, sometimes the root causes will have a better chance of curbing that Anti- Asian beliefs . So, School-Based curriculum recommendations . Obviously, letters to Councilmembers into the Mayor, there have been a number of those that I think you have received and the Mayor's office has received.",253,,
1768,0.97,11748.036,11766.955,Standing Consolidated or the--in solidarity with different low income workers like massage parlor workers . making sure we are able to provide safe working environments for individuals who choose to do that work.,253,,
1769,0.97,11766.955,11793.281,"So, these are a few of the experiences . I know there was a sixth one we heard about which was media . Those touch on some of the things the city has done in the past . for example, the bus campaign ads and the need to ensure accurate representation of the API communities in the media.",253,,
1770,0.97,11793.281,11795.083,Lifting up community voices.,253,,
1771,0.97,11795.083,11813.701,"So, there are ways in which we can center the community voices as these things happen and as we continue to explore how the city can be a good partner and a good ally and proceed with good investments.",253,,
1772,0.97,11813.701,11816.604,Thank you Dr ..,254,,
1773,0.97,11816.604,11829.117,We do have a hard stop for some Councilmembers at 1:00 P.M.,254,,
1774,0.97,11829.117,11832.687,. We had this on the agenda for 20 minutes and we have 10 more minutes.,254,,
1775,0.97,11832.687,11836.124,I want to make sure that the Councilmembers get a chance to ask questions before the hard stop.,254,,
1776,0.97,11836.124,11839.093,If we can pause here before going to more detail.,254,,
1777,0.97,11839.093,11846.201,"Councilmember Gonzalez, I have you listed first.",254,,
1778,0.97,11846.201,11847.035,Thank you so much.,255,,
1779,0.97,11847.035,11859.08,"I'm sorry for the time pressure here, but I do have to get off the committee call today at 1:00 to run to another commitment . So, I have a few questions.",255,,
1780,0.97,11859.08,11869.457,"And, they are primarily around slide 3 and 4. so, I think it is a good time to pose these questions.",255,,
1781,0.97,11869.457,11872.961,"And, like, I just want to get to the heart of the matter here.",255,,
1782,0.97,11872.961,11905.326,"So, we are trying to do these investments in partnership and in cooperation with the Mayor's office to meet a Community- based need . and, I am hearing a lot of concerns, both in public comment and in my mailbox and through staff that certain feedback from community was disregarded, ignored, or being misrepresented . So, that is concerning to me.",255,,
1783,0.97,11905.326,11913.401,"And, I want to express that concern here in hopes that we can reconcile where the differences are.",255,,
1784,0.97,11913.401,11932.62,Because I don't feel comfortable advancing a bill that does not actually truly represent the desires and interests of the community members who these investments are designed to help.,255,,
1785,0.97,11932.62,11949.003,I do believe that the Mayor's office is interested in achieving that same goal and so I am bringing this up in a very direct way because we don't have time to dance around the issue.,255,,
1786,0.97,11949.003,11953.941,Too because I want us to find common ground here and address the concerns that we have been hearing.,255,,
1787,0.97,11953.941,11969.257,"So, we have heard in public comment, particularly that they believe this presentation misrepresents the engagement that occurred with them . So, I want to get a clear answer to that concern that was expressed in public comment.",255,,
1788,0.97,11969.257,11981.069,I also want to have a more specific conversation about what the outreach and engagement was?,255,,
1789,0.97,11981.069,11983.938,"What did it look like, and for which organizations?",255,,
1790,0.97,11983.938,12008.096,"And, where there any other organizations that were spoken to? If so, what was the engagement that occurred with those organizations? and, are there organizations that you decided not to engage within the development of this initial proposal?",255,,
1791,0.97,12008.096,12024.712,"And, you know, on this particular slide, it sort of talks about how there is a group identified . They identified these five things and I'm not sure who the group is.",255,,
1792,0.97,12024.712,12028.916,"I would like to know details about that, as well.",255,,
1793,0.97,12028.916,12037.125,"And then, on slide 3, there was a reference to Hs D's participation.",255,,
1794,0.97,12037.125,12041.696,I don't know what participate means.,255,,
1795,0.97,12041.696,12077.065,"I just need a little bit more understanding of sort of the character your and the depth of the community outreach and engagement . and, I want that Aggregated in a way that clearly tells me that we have done some meaningful community engagement here and that we are not engaging in a practice, whether intentionally or unintentionally, of Cherry picking what we want and leaving in the bucket what we don't want.",255,,
1796,0.97,12077.065,12078.566,Thank you.,256,,
1797,0.97,12078.566,12086.974,I will start and say the name Tonya might be able to provide more detail.,257,,
1798,0.97,12086.974,12102.69,This five point list came from conversations that we have had with Community-Based organizations led by B PSO and I cannot take credit for it.,257,,
1799,0.97,12102.69,12121.008,"A tis and other organizations of Chinese Americans with Oca and friends of little Saigon . I may be missing a few, but those are the ones that I recall.",257,,
1800,0.97,12121.008,12125.78,"So, turning to my other colleagues to see if there is more to add to that.",257,,
1801,0.97,12125.78,12128.115,This is Tonya Kim with the human services Department.,258,,
1802,0.97,12128.115,12132.22,Let me add a little bit of nuance and I think you're picking up on it.,258,,
1803,0.97,12132.22,12150.338,"When Hsd is saying we have been a part of communications for what was just discussed, our staff are actually joining other community members and there is a collective group of folks who are meeting who are named.",258,,
1804,0.97,12150.338,12166.053,We are participants and not leading in that space . These are observations we are picking up and it was not intentional community engagement to inform Hsd's body of work.,258,,
1805,0.97,12166.053,12168.656,We are proposing to invest back and community for community led solutions.,258,,
1806,0.97,12168.656,12184.438,"That is a slide down the presentation . When we do the Rfp we are proposing to do, or when we are investing in community providers we are currently contracting with, we will do intentional engagement.",258,,
1807,0.97,12184.438,12192.847,"We have been in partnership with folks and talking with folks and these are some of the early, initial things that we have heard.",258,,
1808,0.97,12192.847,12203.357,We still need to do a specific community engagement that will inform an expedited Rfp . I do want to clarify that nuance.,258,,
1809,0.97,12203.357,12212.2,There are conversations that we had directly with the different organizations that were listed on the previous slide.,258,,
1810,0.97,12212.2,12216.203,"That was really just like, how are you doing and what are you hearing and what do you need?",258,,
1811,0.97,12216.203,12232.62,"The theme really is around community solutions . please invest in what we are currently doing and also in pilots as well . So, it is consistent with where we intend to go with the additional 100 and $300,000 stages.",258,,
1812,0.97,12232.62,12256.41,"I would just share, and I appreciate the questions . So, the specific direct question around the concern regarding some of the investments on the SPD side . The investments we are proposing, and perhaps I can get this real quick.",259,,
1813,0.97,12256.41,12282.67,It is specifically around--we have heard from community members and we have shared a list with the budget chair's office of over 61 organizations and individual folks we have been talking with over the weeks . What are the needs and asks?,259,,
1814,0.97,12282.67,12297.652,"That's why the funding is mostly in Community-Based organizations . It allows the community to work with them directly on what are your needs? so, that is where most of the funding is going . I think to answer your question is the crime prevention coordinator.",259,,
1815,0.97,12297.652,12306.861,One thing we have heard is from community and from some of the businesses who have also been hit by hate crimes.,259,,
1816,0.97,12306.861,12330.985,"They have mentioned some things around, how do we make sure the neighbors and the community are safe? anything from lighting outside and how this is set up on the street or inside the business, what can we do to help workers and keep the community safe? that is around crime prevention by environmental design.",259,,
1817,0.97,12330.985,12338.392,When we heard of that need--I don't know why this keeps happening.,259,,
1818,0.97,12338.392,12339.493,"Adrian, you just went on mute.",259,,
1819,0.97,12339.493,12340.294,It happened earlier.,259,,
1820,0.97,12340.294,12341.929,[Laughter].,260,,
1821,0.97,12341.929,12346.2,"I will share--go ahead, please.",261,,
1822,0.97,12346.2,12368.723,What we heard of the specific need was from the coordinator switch was essentially Nonuniformed and Non-Officer response which the Coordinators are trained in environmental design . that is actually what we had identified based on what we heard the need was.,262,,
1823,0.97,12368.723,12376.263,"So, that is why we had done that.",262,,
1824,0.97,12376.263,12384.772,"It is not a police officer or a detective, it is a Nonuniform response . I hope that answered the question a little more directly.",262,,
1825,0.97,12384.772,12398.786,"Yeah, I appreciate that, Adrian . I'm sorry that the ghosts keep randomly Muting people today . I don't know what is happening.",263,,
1826,0.97,12398.786,12404.558,"On the bias crime prevention coordinator, there is a couple of things, right?",263,,
1827,0.97,12404.558,12455.743,"I think there is a lot of interest in you know, built-in environment improvements that help with the perception and the feel of an area of being safe . those programs, as far as I know, are traditionally run through the police departments across the country . We are certainly no exception there . I think on the bias crime prevention corridor in Nader, the policy question, as I see it, is the position better housed within the community, like the public safety coordinator position that we have funded indirect response and in the aftermath of Donnie chin's murder . or, is that position better housed within the Seattle police Department?",263,,
1828,0.97,12455.743,12461.916,"And, I think, to me, that is what the policy question is.",264,,
1829,0.97,12461.916,12473.661,I would like to hear from the executive why you have chosen to house the bias crime prevention coordinator.,264,,
1830,0.97,12473.661,12484.905,Within the Seattle police Department as opposed to.,264,,
1831,0.97,12485.739,12491.879,What we did in 2016.,264,,
1832,0.97,12491.879,12510.497,"From a policy perspective, the reason it is housed in the police Department as their was--the reason it was in this particular legislation, this is Repurposed legislation in SPD.",265,,
1833,0.97,12510.497,12515.87,"Instead of hiring an officer, we are directing the Department to hire a crime prevention coordinator.",265,,
1834,0.97,12515.87,12535.856,The budget is in the Department itself and it is an officer who is in the position to do this work.,265,,
1835,0.97,12545.299,12567.922,They are Repurposed seeing from officer to a Non-Officer position to perform the functions that are in line with what we have heard what the community was asking for.,266,,
1836,0.97,12567.922,12572.426,Somebody is to do this work.,267,,
1837,0.97,12572.426,12578.399,I am not persuaded that the community of work was asked for in the police Department.,267,,
1838,0.97,12578.399,12580.401,That's what I want to understand.,267,,
1839,0.97,12580.401,12620.674,"Sort of, why is this body of work . I am trying understand why there was a decision to keep the Biased crime prevention coordinator? like can this person not do the work if they are not within SPD?",267,,
1840,0.97,12620.674,12635.789,"Like, is there going to be some sort of like practical, you know, impediment to this person with the bias crime prevention coordinator if there housed outside of SPD.",267,,
1841,0.97,12635.789,12640.327,Help me understand these practical implications of this choice.,267,,
1842,0.97,12640.327,12652.239,I have directly represented the crime prevention Coordinators . because of their position within the Department.,268,,
1843,0.97,12652.239,12657.444,One being Nonuniformed which is the alternative response which is what I have heard with alternative ways.,268,,
1844,0.97,12657.444,12681.068,"But actually having the Department itself having access to information because they are in the police Department to gain access to crime data in a way that is more real-time . So, when things happen, a private crime prevention coordinator from a response phase can respond quicker in that particular capacity.",268,,
1845,0.97,12681.068,12699.987,They also do coordinate with officers to look at what prevention is and then they are directly in community working wit businesses and working with community to identify areas where the prevention can happen.,268,,
1846,0.97,12699.987,12705.192,The information is greater in the police Department . This is a policy choice that was made.,268,,
1847,0.97,12705.192,12716.17,"Because in their roles, you know, part of their role is that it's essential for them in the Department because of access to information.",268,,
1848,0.97,12716.17,12747.501,"But, you know, what they perform as a function isn't in exactly with alignment . I'm not saying that's what we propose, but I have heard what the need is and we have what they have requested and what the need was.",268,,
1849,0.97,12747.501,12754.208,"Council President, I know you are on a short Timeline, do you have a follow-up?",269,,
1850,0.97,12754.208,12758.312,I am here happy to hear from Dr. Kohn.,270,,
1851,0.97,12758.312,12760.948,I just wanted to give my two cents worth.,271,,
1852,0.97,12760.948,12771.458,This conversation is not normally what I would refer to.,271,,
1853,0.97,12771.458,12804.958,"In general, I would want all of us to consider that it is our hope to reform the culture of policing . We must hold law enforcement agencies, we should hold them to a standard of success for Nonuniformed positions . I think it is wise to at least try to put Nonuniformed positions toward crime prevention and asked the police Department to change their culture to help them succeed.",271,,
1854,0.97,12804.958,12824.511,That is just my two cents worth . I have always wanted to see that happen because it seems like in general that law enforcement--they are largely supportive of a uniformed response because it is the cultural way of doing things.,271,,
1855,0.97,12824.511,12837.224,"So, we might have to request more of these positions to be put among them and ask for their support with this.",271,,
1856,0.97,12837.224,12848.835,"Yeah, and I would just say from a policy perspective that I am not opposed to increasing civilian iced functions within the police Department.",272,,
1857,0.97,12848.835,12865.953,"I have been a big supporter of that . Ergo, the resurrection of the community safety officer program which is also a civilian iced program and I would love to see that being brought to scale.",272,,
1858,0.97,12865.953,12890.978,But also just the work as the public safety chair for four years before . We have spent a lot of time digging into how we can increase that in the police Department and so that is not my objection or concern that I am expressing here.,272,,
1859,0.97,12890.978,12906.393,"As a policy maker, I feel I have the responsibility to understand why there are choices being made to how certain positions are in a certain Department as opposed to within the community.",272,,
1860,0.97,12906.393,12981.935,"I apologize that I keep harping back to the creation of a public safety coordinator . I'm not saying it is an apples to apples consideration, but there is a strong nexus between what the city has chosen to do in a similar realm related to public safety and the coordinator position and what we are trying to accomplish here . and, I want to make the best decision on how do allocate these funds with the best available information . that is why I am being a stickler on continuing to ask these questions . I'm just trying to understand why we think this position is better housed within the police Department as opposed to within a Community-Based organization that still has access to the information that they need to be able to effectively represent community interest and to be the strongest position policy bull to be the liaison between businesses and community organizations and the police Department.",272,,
1861,0.97,12981.935,12994.381,"For me, the question is, do we want this position housed within the SPD, or do we want it to have a strong connection to the SPD and be housed in a Community-Based organization?",273,,
1862,0.97,12994.381,13011.298,"And, I'm sorry, but I just don't feel that I am getting--I don't feel I have a clear sense of how this came to be to be able to sort of pass judgment on it one way or the other this week.",273,,
1863,0.97,13011.298,13014.167,That was actually really helpful in what you were describing.,274,,
1864,0.97,13014.167,13023.21,"Maybe I can help this a little further . First, you mentioned the community safety officers.",274,,
1865,0.97,13023.21,13041.528,The crime prevention coordinator is the same issue with cut after cut over the past several years . It is difficult for them to fully function because they have so much territory to cover because they are the alternate police response.,274,,
1866,0.97,13041.528,13043.997,This is an opportunity to build that backup on the civilian side.,274,,
1867,0.97,13043.997,13046.8,And what we have heard with the need for community and how that works.,274,,
1868,0.97,13046.8,13056.51,"What you are describing is Activity-Based, activity and that's why most of it is Community-Based.",274,,
1869,0.97,13056.51,13071.124,Identifying where there is a liaison or other things we need to have focused on a Community- based organization . The funding is there and we can do that work as well.,274,,
1870,0.97,13071.124,13076.463,"It is not meant to be one choice or the other, but I appreciate you asking that question.",274,,
1871,0.97,13076.463,13088.008,We have identified a possible solution and that does not preclude our ability to fund the liaison position or use some of the other capacity building dollars to do that work.,274,,
1872,0.97,13088.008,13095.882,And to actually reside in the Community-Based organization to be that liaison.,274,,
1873,0.97,13095.882,13102.055,The environmental design is what we had heard knowing that most of the money would be at the Community-Based level.,274,,
1874,0.97,13102.055,13110.197,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, you have your hand up?",275,,
1875,0.97,13110.197,13121.475,If not my finger on the scale of whether or not this is a position that should be funded with SPD existing funds that are outside of the Department.,276,,
1876,0.97,13121.475,13134.02,"But, I did want a little more affirmation that it may be part of why the executive is making the proposal that it is making.",276,,
1877,0.97,13134.02,13153.54,I did discuss this issue with chief Diaz a number of weeks ago and he reminded me that the city has a individual who is the detective who focuses on bias crimes.,276,,
1878,0.97,13153.54,13183.57,"Her title is actually bias crimes coordinator . So, even though her function is really focused on work associated with bias crimes that have happened, she is, in essence, doing many of the things that we would expect somebody focused on bias crimes on the prevention side.",276,,
1879,0.97,13183.57,13219.839,"She is doing many of those things while also acting as a detective investigating bias crimes . So,, again, I hope that is helpful information about the function that a uniformed officer within SPD is fulfilling right now . and, I mean, again, regardless of where the staff for these",276,,
1880,0.97,13350.336,13364.417,"There is an amount of funding up to $250,000 that could potentially be used for a position like this . It is still something I am interested in getting to the heart of . is there a way to use the additional dollars and to directly fund it?",277,,
1881,0.97,13364.417,13377.964,"Maybe through Oir, the office of refugee affairs or directly through the process so we have a better understanding of what people would like to see.",277,,
1882,0.97,13377.964,13397.851,"Obviously there could be collaboration with the existing crime prevention work that is done within the city, but that's a big question mark for me .

1888,0.97,13434.287,13445.698,We are looking for a balance to make sure that we are not creating additional harm or unintended consequences as we seek to provide solutions and that is the intention you are hearing now.,277,,
1889,0.97,13445.698,13459.345,We want to make sure that it is understood this comes from a place of wanting and meaningful investments and not to create harm or to leave out voices that may be trying to inform our next steps here.,277,,
1890,0.97,13459.345,13468.955,"Colleagues, are there feedback from you about the next steps?",277,,

1892,0.97,13474.06,13477.831,I do want to sort of do a little bit of level setting here.,278,,
1893,0.97,13477.831,13515.168,"Because I don't want members of the public or any of us to walk away with the impression that we think that the vast majority of these investments are, you know, creating harm, or that any are creating harm . from my perspective, I acknowledge that a vast majority of the $1.5 million or a significant portion of the $1.5 million is proposed to go straight to Community-Based organizations and community led efforts.",278,,
1894,0.97,13515.168,13524.377,"The only issue where I think we have been focusing in on is to be very clear, a $150,000 investment of the $1.5 million.",278,,

1896,0.97,13540.56,13584.671,"So, I want to invite us, if we can, I want to invite us to consider voting this bill out of committee today with the understanding that over the next few days that we have some work to do to get a clearer understanding of the $150,000 proposed investment for the community . The Biased crime community position in it . So, I still have some questions about it but I don't feel I need to Belabor those questions in committee today.",278,,
1897,0.97,13584.671,13634.187,"I trust we will be able to have communications to get clarity around the $150,000 portion of this investment . But, I would hate to hold up the other almost $1.4 million in investments over a $150,000 question . So, I think there seems to be a lot of agreement around the rest of it and if we can sort of challenge ourselves to keep open channels of communication over the next few days, before Monday, then I would feel comfortable seeing this move out of committee today in the spirit of understanding that, again, a significant portion of these dollars, over 1 million of these dollars, are being directed into Community-Based organizations.",278,,

The Mayor's executive order and her funding commitment to address hate crime with recommendations to the Council in August of last year.,280,,
1903,0.97,13690.276,13722.375,"We did not receive those recommendations last year . I made inquiries with the Mayor's office last year to inquire and I have appreciated the conversations I have had with Dr. con and Dr. Lockhart about those questions .
