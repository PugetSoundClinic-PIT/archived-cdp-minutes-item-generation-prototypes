217,0.8941873908042908,1171.4,1175.9,So essentially we're dealing with a lot of populations from the encampments.,,,

224,0.7633575201034546,1198.3,1204.1,So we place them in a hotel in in lodging and we are giving them a chance to stabilize.,,,

245,0.770641565322876,1310.7,1314.7,The need is at that time and we're a rapport building also.,,,
246,0.770641565322876,1314.9,1332.3,"And what we found out, what happens is when we focus on why we do what we do like, why do I go meet somebody who who here's a little story, a participant who got caught with like a needle in their room and they were so judgmental.",,,
247,0.770641565322876,1332.6,1334.0,They were so afraid of getting kicked.,,,

250,0.912838876247406,1338.0,1340.9,That's why I have needles in it but that's not true.,,,
251,0.912838876247406,1341.1,1351.0,So criminalizing this criminalizing people in their mode of whether it's addiction whether it's homelessness or whatever is what they've been used to.,,,
252,0.912838876247406,1351.7,1356.5,"They've been disconnected, this shovel disenfranchised which leads to a lot of disappointment.",,,
253,0.912838876247406,1356.5,1359.0,"So when they first come into the program, what happens is?",,,
254,0.912838876247406,1359.3,1363.4,"It takes a while we think we're just going to, you know, that's the normal approach.",,,
255,0.912838876247406,1363.4,1363.9,We're just going to,,,
256,0.7911896109580994,1364.1,1366.5, tackle their problem and everything is going to be okay.,,,
257,0.7911896109580994,1366.9,1380.1,But that's not that's not it this this motivational interviewing navigating through systems sitting down with them is like a peer-to-peer model where everybody is on the same playing field.,,,
258,0.7911896109580994,1380.2,1392.4,"And I just want to like, ended with this, like, we're so used to putting people, like, we're so used to criminalize and their behavior that's based off that the namik levels, and and survival survival skills.",,,
259,0.7911896109580994,1392.7,1393.9,But just imagine,,,
260,0.9128382802009583,1394.2,1401.9," Like this presentation wouldn't even be happy, if all we did, was put them in jail and let them back out to the same model.",,,
261,0.9128382802009583,1402.2,1411.6,So we apply a bunch of different techniques throughout throughout the day and throughout the week and throughout the month and we stay consistent with doing it with dignity.,,,
262,0.8854750394821167,1413.8,1414.2, Thank you.,,,

266,0.8825629949569702,1434.5,1448.2,"So, with some of our early Lessons Learned, the lodging liaison is pretty key and instrumental we have for hotels.",,,
267,0.8825629949569702,1448.2,1463.1,"That colead is working in right now and that hotel liaison role is really about, you know, responding to and resolving issues that come up and doing that in.",,,
268,0.9037736654281616,1463.1,1470.1," Way, that's mutually beneficial and supports really kind of three key groups, right?",,,
269,0.9037736654281616,1470.1,1475.1,"So that's the colead staff, that might be there though, that's the participants as well.",,,
270,0.9037736654281616,1475.1,1493.1,"And then that's also our hotel staff and partners and one of the ways that we're able to do that is because of our temporary lodging agreement, it's an agreement that is signed by all of our participants before",,,
271,0.7707297801971436,1493.1,1498.0," before they receive, you know, keys to their new room.",,,
272,0.7707297801971436,1498.0,1514.4,"But it really kind of lays out our expectations of them that also mirror some of the language in their also mirrors, you know, kind of some of the rules and that kind of thing, compliance related things from the hotels as well.",,,
273,0.7707297801971436,1515.5,1523.1,"And so, that's really important you, you've heard a lot about some of the techniques that we use harm reduction, and things of that nature, but it's also important to",,,
274,0.7632702589035034,1523.2,1528.6, Note that while those techniques are used for daily engagement.,,,
275,0.7632702589035034,1528.6,1531.7,"It doesn't mean that there aren't boundaries, right?",,,
276,0.7632702589035034,1531.7,1545.9,And so the temporary lodging agreement allows for us to maintain boundaries and compliance and adherence to those things where needed we also found and dr.,,,

279,0.9128384590148926,1559.0,1564.6,"It's really, really difficult to help people to stabilize when they don't have enough food.",,,
280,0.9128384590148926,1564.6,1576.1,"And so, in some of our hotels, there are full kitchens and then some, there are our hotel Partners have been great, allowing us to use microwaves and a variety of other things.",,,
281,0.9128384590148926,1576.8,1582.5,Another thing that I really want to make sure that I hit on is that diversity of our staff.,,,
282,0.9128382205963135,1583.2,1588.8, And so we are very intentional in the makeup of our staff.,,,
283,0.9128382205963135,1588.8,1598.2,"So we really took the time to Value, you know, academic experience along with deep lived experience as well.",,,
284,0.9128382205963135,1598.5,1603.4,And so many of our staff members have a combination of degrees and certificates.,,,

422,0.8926995396614075,2467.6,2470.1,So it's great stuff.,,,
423,0.8926995396614075,2470.1,2484.7,"Before I invite questions from my colleagues, I was wondering if somebody could as simply as possible tell us how is colead different than lead?",,,
424,0.8926995396614075,2484.7,2486.7,And then how is just cares.,,,
425,0.9004803895950317,2487.0,2487.5, Different than colead.,,,
426,0.9004803895950317,2487.5,2499.7,"I appreciated that there was a, there's a diagram early on to try to, to try to graphically, explain what just cares is.",,,
427,0.9004803895950317,2499.7,2513.9,"But I think because where we've been so familiar with lead, it would be helpful if there's just like one or two things that makes colead different than lead and then similarly, a couple things that makes just cares different than colead.",,,
428,0.8270583748817444,2515.8,2527.7," Sure, I can, I can try to take a try at that and maybe some of my colleagues can help the traditional lead case management model is based on Street.",,,
429,0.8270583748817444,2527.7,2533.7,Based Outreach case management of historically this has been provided by the reach program.,,,
430,0.8270583748817444,2534.0,2541.3,"Excellent, high quality Case Management, low caseloads, but not tied to a dedicated Housing Resource.",,,
431,0.8270583748817444,2541.3,2545.4,And so the reach caseworkers are amazing and wonderful.,,,
432,0.8962683081626892,2545.4,2554.1," But also, just trying to navigate the existing Social Services landscape, which prior to covid-19, ready challenged I come from 12 Years.",,,
433,0.8962683081626892,2554.1,2566.5,"In the behavioral health system, we don't have adequate behavioral health or housing resources for this population that lives at the intersection of extreme poverty, low level law violations and behavioral health conditions.",,,
434,0.8962683081626892,2566.5,2575.1,So colead is an adaptation of that model that is Hotel based and so still taking the same location slowed.,,,
435,0.8902327418327332,2575.5,2583.5," Harm reduction, honoring agency, and self-determination approach, but the services are very short-term on the street.",,,

437,0.8902327418327332,2593.7,2600.6,"Once people come inside and are at the hotel, we see people every day, sometimes multiple times per day.",,,
438,0.8902327418327332,2600.6,2605.2,"So it really is a pairing of extremely intensive, case management with",,,
439,0.893156111240387,2605.5,2607.8, More of a residential type of Framing.,,,
440,0.893156111240387,2607.8,2612.3,And that's where there is a pretty Stark departure from the classic lead program.,,,
441,0.893156111240387,2612.3,2631.0,The other pieces to this are a dedicated medical provider that comes to the hotels does covid testing and a lot of other health care kind of connection upon placement and then the other big piece that's different from traditional case management is our schedule.,,,
442,0.893156111240387,2631.0,2635.3,"So, we are seven days a week and we have staff on site as a whole",,,
443,0.8912619352340698,2635.4,2642.8, Hotels from eight in the morning until 7:30 in the night and then somebody is on call and a supervisor is on call overnight.,,,
444,0.8912619352340698,2642.8,2650.7,"We've also just entered into a wonderful partnership, we're about two weeks in with the wheeler Davis conglomerate.",,,
445,0.8912619352340698,2650.7,2662.3,This is Dom Davis from Community passageways and Stephanie wheeler of stood up a community safety team and they are providing on-site part of round throughout the evening for support our participants overnight.,,,
446,0.8912619352340698,2662.3,2664.9,So that is very different from the traditional,,,
447,0.8229020237922668,2665.5,2679.1," Management model, and I would just say the dedicated housing interim, housing component is probably the that, and the schedule, the shift, the shift based program are the two most important differences.",,,
448,0.8229020237922668,2679.1,2682.8,But I do want to give a big head nod to the reach program.,,,
449,0.8229020237922668,2682.8,2695.1,"They've taught us everything about harm reduction and their particular case management approach that you don't text, you don't tend to see across the traditional Medicaid funded behavioral health treatment system.",,,
450,0.8229020237922668,2695.1,2695.3,It's very,,,
451,0.8848982453346252,2695.4,2697.9, very different and we owe a lot to them.,,,
452,0.8848982453346252,2697.9,2707.4,"In terms of what we've been able to build off of in this model and it's because of their relationships on the street with folks that we even been able to pull off, just care.",,,

456,0.8848982453346252,2717.9,2724.8,"So, just care is about, is about the framework and targeting actual neighborhoods and actual sites within the neighborhood.",,,
457,0.7543099522590637,2725.5,2730.5, Just cares about the way people come in and working across multiple providers.,,,
458,0.7543099522590637,2730.5,2740.3,So the opportunities that just care gave us was to engage with acrs and Victor and Chief Seattle Club to do more beyond what we just did in Cody's.,,,
459,0.7543099522590637,2740.3,2755.3,So it's sort of like it's more than the sum of its parts I guess is we're all land with which to leverage Community stakeholders and partners who also are have community.,,,

654,0.8919515013694763,3969.6,3969.9, It.,,,
655,0.8919515013694763,3972.0,3991.0,"And so that's why if the council is interested in using our ordinance, in amending, our ordinance, as a way to express our policy, preferences related to the less lethal weapons, we do need to consider the recommendations of the accountability partners.",,,

666,0.8947329521179199,4056.7,4059.6, under this current plan will be bringing an amended ordinance.,,,

670,0.7571000456809998,4078.8,4086.8,"So that again is the environment that we're navigating as judge, robot will have the ultimate say on the legislation since the city is under a consent decree.",,,
671,0.7571000456809998,4087.9,4102.1,"And then separately, we don't need to discuss this now, but it's important to also be aware that in June us, district court ordered restrictions on the use of crowd control, weapons completely separately from the",,,

690,0.8339712023735046,4238.0,4249.6, Discussion of how she envisions the next committee meeting going and how members would move ahead on a vote on specific decision items placed before them?,,,

693,0.9009794592857361,4260.2,4270.1," Thanks so before I jump into slide number three, I want to reiterate some and important point that the chair made Council Bill 1 1980 five.",,,
694,0.9009794592857361,4270.1,4289.9,"Now ordinance 1 2 6 10 to effectively ban the purchase youth purchase and use of all less, lethal weapons, the ordinance prohibited the use of these devices under First Amendment rights when folks are demonstrating but also left the police department without the ability to use less lethal weapons when",,,

701,0.8741106986999512,4331.9,4339.8,"So I'll go ahead and jump into this slide when the accountability agencies presented their recommendations on reauthorizing, less lethal weapons.",,,
702,0.8741106986999512,4339.8,4346.0,They talked about the appropriateness of less lethal weapons in specific kinds of circumstances the table.,,,
703,0.8741106986999512,4346.0,4349.8,Before you is designed to facilitate today's discussion by capturing the,,,

706,0.902482271194458,4361.5,4372.9,"So, if the committee wanted to move forward with legislation that authorized some less lethal Weapons Under certain kinds of conditions, or categories than these categories would need to be pretty.",,,
707,0.902482271194458,4372.9,4379.4,"Well, defined in the committee's last meeting on this topic, the accountability agency said that they could provide some guidance.",,,
708,0.8928436040878296,4380.3,4385.4, Especially in the area of using less lethal weapons for crowd dispersed whole purposes.,,,
709,0.8928436040878296,4385.4,4387.8,"So, I'm just going to go over at a high level.",,,
710,0.8928436040878296,4387.8,4402.4,"The categories that are shown here, the first one is Patrol use, and, and an example of this might be where an officer would you say a 40 mm launcher, against a suspect, that is holding a knife.",,,
711,0.8928436040878296,4402.7,4409.0,"This example would assume that an officer is qualified to use the launcher and allowed to do so, under SPD policy.",,,
712,0.9020941257476807,4409.8,4418.8," An example of the second category, tactical use might be where a SWAT officer fires tear gas into an unoccupied building.",,,
713,0.9020941257476807,4418.8,4428.7,"That is currently only occupied by a barricaded subject, who refuses to come out the crowd dispersal category.",,,
714,0.9020941257476807,4428.7,4438.2,Obviously represents times when SPD would need to end a demonstration because there are threats to life safety of the participants or property destruction.,,,
715,0.9047919511795044,4440.1,4445.1," So as you can see in the table, there is really only one use category that all agencies.",,,
716,0.9047919511795044,4445.1,4449.5,"Agree, should remain band and only for one type of less Lethal Weapon.",,,
717,0.9047919511795044,4449.5,4452.7,That is tear gas for patrol use.,,,
718,0.9047919511795044,4452.7,4468.9,"That is a situation that would not normally happen under spd's policies and in fact, if you go to the end of the table, you will see that there is an NA",,,
719,0.8998545408248901,4469.8,4487.4," And a under flashbang, diversionary devices, and that's because those are prohibited by SPD policy to be used by officers who don't have specific training in those devices, and that would not fall under Patrol use.",,,
720,0.8998545408248901,4487.4,4494.8,And so that's generally the only place where there is total agreement.,,,
721,0.8998545408248901,4494.8,4499.0,I would note that the CPC has,,,
722,0.7731448411941528,4499.8,4515.9," cated that tear gas and blast balls should be banned for every kind of use in every kind of circumstance and they have in the past issued recommendations and guidelines and requests asking that, that SPD follow that direction.",,,
723,0.7731448411941528,4517.2,4529.4,"Finally, I'd note that the OPA in the oig generally agree on reauthorization, for nearly every kind of less Lethal Weapon and in nearly every kind of circumstance with the",,,
724,0.8967719078063965,4529.9,4533.5, Love tear gas being used for crowd dispersal purposes.,,,
725,0.8967719078063965,4533.5,4540.1,"As you can see, in the table, the OPA would not allow that or want to continue a band there.",,,
726,0.8967719078063965,4540.1,4550.9,"And the oig would want to keep that as a tool available to SPD, but only under specific kinds of purposes or specific kinds of policies.",,,
727,0.8967719078063965,4551.1,4554.5,"And you can we state that last Point, Greg?",,,
728,0.8967719078063965,4554.9,4559.6,"Yeah, and so, when using tear gas again, well, the",,,
729,0.8921785354614258,4559.8,4569.5," CPC, and the OPA would continue a ban on tear gas against, or for use of crowd, dispersal purposes in any way.",,,
730,0.8921785354614258,4569.5,4574.5,"Or in any manner, the oig would not continue.",,,
731,0.8921785354614258,4574.5,4589.6,"A ban on tear gas but would allow or believes that SPD should only use tear gas against a crowd in visit in very specific circumstances and I believe what I heard, Inspector General judge.",,,
732,0.9070940017700195,4589.8,4608.8," Say, in the last meeting only where there was a riot, something was an absolute riot Mayhem, where life safety was at risk, and the particular demonstration was happening, where there was no risk of the teargas reaching other people.",,,
733,0.9070940017700195,4609.1,4617.5,I'll let let her elaborate on on that and other points in our presentation as we as we move along further.,,,
734,0.893435537815094,4619.2,4620.2, Does that answer your question?,,,
735,0.893435537815094,4620.5,4621.0,Thank you.,,,
736,0.893435537815094,4621.1,4621.6,Yes.,,,
737,0.893435537815094,4622.2,4628.5,"Okay, so before I move any further, I want to know some important points first, Madam chair.",,,
738,0.893435537815094,4628.5,4629.8,Is you noted?,,,
739,0.893435537815094,4629.8,4632.9,This is not an inclusive list of all less lethal weapons.,,,
740,0.893435537815094,4632.9,4641.7,Rather these are the less lethal weapons that are most used by SPD and were the most discussed in the last committee meeting.,,,
741,0.893435537815094,4641.7,4647.2,So I think they're good for the purpose of guiding today's discussion.,,,
742,0.893435537815094,4647.2,4648.7,"But when we get to the end,",,,
743,0.8653306365013123,4649.1,4657.1," Of this presentation will have to talk a bit about how the committee would approach other less lethal weapons, that aren't listed here.",,,
744,0.8653306365013123,4657.3,4662.9,"And while the accountability agencies agree, that less lethal weapons should not continue to be banned.",,,
745,0.8653306365013123,4662.9,4675.7,"In many of these circumstances this in no way, discounts is the danger of less lethal weapons and should not be seen as an endorsement for SPD to return to its prior practices for the use of these weapons.",,,
746,0.8653306365013123,4675.7,4678.9,"And in fact, the agencies have",,,
747,0.7638652920722961,4679.0,4690.1," Have already provided to SPD cautions about the use of these weapons in various forms and with that, I'd asked Alex to flip to the next slide please.",,,
748,0.9057923555374146,4691.7,4706.0," So, in the past, the accountability agencies have noted and and sent in various forms, either by letter or management action, or findings that less lethal weapons.",,,
749,0.9057923555374146,4706.0,4714.2,"Can obviously cause injury or death, and that agencies, or that SPD should guard against specifically.",,,
750,0.9057923555374146,4714.2,4721.4,"Indiscriminate use, where they're turning weapons on a cruise,",,,
751,0.903587818145752,4721.5,4727.9, Would some of which may not be some of the participants may not be committing crimes.,,,
752,0.903587818145752,4729.3,4736.9,"They've talked about teargas, potentially infiltrating buildings and hurting folks that are not in.",,,
753,0.903587818145752,4736.9,4746.2,"Protests pepper, spray being used against folks who are not putting up resistance last balls.",,,
754,0.903587818145752,4746.6,4751.0,There have been a number of recommendations about how glass balls should be deployed.,,,
755,0.9045261740684509,4751.4,4756.3, That it's not appropriate to send them into crowds above crowds or near people.,,,
756,0.9045261740684509,4757.3,4778.6,"Alex, if you could keep going and flip one more side, please that the 40 mm launcher should not be has a danger to post to strike, non targeted, individuals, or miss a Target, all together, all of these things that the risk level is worth using these devices which are dangerous.",,,
757,0.9045261740684509,4778.6,4781.3,"And as I said before, it could cause injury or death.",,,
758,0.9128382205963135,4781.9,4795.3," And then the noise flash diversionary devices, much like the glass balls deploying them at people, so because I'm saying that the agencies would not for the most part.",,,
759,0.9128382205963135,4796.4,4803.4,"It's particularly the OPA in the oig, would not continue a ban on these devices.",,,
760,0.9128382205963135,4803.8,4811.5,"It should not be interpreted in any way that that that their recommendation would be to return to Prior use policies, rather than that.",,,
761,0.8682333827018738,4811.9,4830.0, SPD follow these cautions and the direction that had been provided by management action letters and other letters and then also follow the specific policies that were proposed in the recommendations that came before the committee last time it met.,,,
762,0.8682333827018738,4830.5,4836.5,"And with that, I think I'm going to turn it over to Lisa K who's going to summarize at a very high level.",,,
763,0.8682333827018738,4836.5,4841.5,The recommendations that the accountability agencies made there were a,,,
764,0.9128382205963135,4841.6,4849.6," Lot of recommendations, they were very detailed some in specific circumstances, some that address specific circumstances and specific weapons.",,,
765,0.9128382205963135,4851.4,4864.7,And so what central staff is attempting to do here is just give the committee a high-level flavor of of recommendations that were made before the last before the last meeting.,,,
766,0.9128382205963135,4864.7,4866.9,"So with that, I'll turn it over to Lisa.",,,
767,0.8237619400024414,4868.0,4869.9, Thanks Greg and Madam chair.,,,
768,0.8237619400024414,4869.9,4872.0,"Lisa K here, from Central staff Alex.",,,
769,0.8237619400024414,4872.0,4873.7,Can we go ahead to slide six?,,,
770,0.8237619400024414,4873.7,4875.5,"Please, thank you.",,,
771,0.8237619400024414,4875.5,4882.7,"So these next two, slides, that I'll talk about Identify some of the common themes that we saw in oversight agencies recommendations.",,,
772,0.8237619400024414,4883.2,4893.9,"As Greg said, these are at a very high level and they don't attempt to capture all of the nuance and detail provided in the reports some of which were very extensive.",,,
773,0.8237619400024414,4894.4,4897.7,So as the slide before you shows all three agencies.,,,
774,0.8468665480613708,4897.9,4905.8, Agree that for the most part teargas should be banned and also that the city needs defined policies and protocols for the use of less lethal weapons.,,,
775,0.8468665480613708,4905.8,4912.3,"As Greg noted oig found that tear gas, may be warranted during what their report called a full-scale riot.",,,
776,0.9085232019424438,4913.7,4926.2, Additional themes speak to the need for detailed tactical plans for crowd control in advance of deployment and also a Prohibition against using less lethal weapons solely to prevent property destruction during a demonstration.,,,
777,0.9085232019424438,4926.2,4934.3,I would note here that the CPC did recommend against using less lethal weapons during any First Amendment protected activity,,,
778,0.8418208360671997,4936.3,4954.5," Let's turn to slide seven, please Alex so other themes that we found are the need for improved communication, both in content and delivery and in having the right technology available and on hand when you need it in addition we saw themes.",,,
779,0.8418208360671997,4954.8,4960.6,Calling for a more thorough training in the use of the less lethal weapons with Hands-On practice.,,,
780,0.8418208360671997,4960.6,4964.9,"Where, where feasible and for stronger accountability measures when",,,
781,0.8097177147865295,4965.2,4967.0, Leave the weapons have been used.,,,
782,0.8938289284706116,4968.7,4977.1, Finally both Opa and oig advise against requiring executive authorization prior to the use of less lethal weapons.,,,
783,0.8938289284706116,4977.1,4987.5,And this advice was on the grounds that the executive isn't likely to have field knowledge or what's called situational awareness from an impartial Observer during a demonstration.,,,
784,0.8938289284706116,4987.5,4997.8,"So they may not, they may get, you may not have the full picture before they make a decision and that many active decisions and situations require quick decisions to",,,
785,0.5895757079124451,4998.0,4998.9, Jackknife safety.,,,
786,0.8973078727722168,4999.9,5008.2," I do want to note that agency staff did advise us that they interpreted this question about executive authorization, that was posed in the ordinance.",,,
787,0.8973078727722168,5008.2,5017.2,"The council adopted, they interpreted this question somewhat narrowly and haven't taken a position as to whether when and how the executive should declare a riot.",,,
788,0.8973078727722168,5017.2,5024.9,"Which is, in fact, a different question than whether the executive should reauthorize, a specific use of less lethal weapons in an active situation.",,,
789,0.8973078727722168,5025.3,5029.2,"So Lisa for instance, if we wanted to",,,
790,0.8746811747550964,5030.0,5047.7, Do an outright ban on teargas consistent with accountability Partners recommendations with a very narrow exception as recommended by the oig that allows for the use only in cases of the Declaration of a riot.,,,
791,0.8746811747550964,5047.7,5055.0,We could in that instance ask for some sort of a executive authorization or we could have it.,,,
792,0.8746811747550964,5055.1,5057.7,We could have we could have a discussion.,,,
793,0.8746811747550964,5057.7,5059.5,It has not been that.,,,
794,0.8746811747550964,5059.5,5059.7,We don't,,,
795,0.9017258882522583,5059.8,5069.3," Not have a recommendation saying, it's a bad idea to ask for, or have some sort of an executive authorization of a full-scale riot.",,,
796,0.9017258882522583,5069.9,5070.7,Exactly.,,,
797,0.9017258882522583,5070.7,5072.5,And I think Greg and I have talked about that.,,,
798,0.9017258882522583,5072.5,5077.5,Then in that instance you'd probably want to include a definition of riot in your ordinance.,,,
799,0.9017258882522583,5077.5,5081.1,So that everybody knew what the thresholds were before.,,,
800,0.9017258882522583,5081.1,5084.3,That kind of Declaration would be make you enabled.,,,
801,0.9017258882522583,5084.3,5089.7,So that that really wraps up sort of the high level themes but madam,,,
802,0.7106125354766846,5089.9,5102.0," Are given that this is very high level, the oversight agencies may have some specific areas of emphasis that I haven't covered or they would like to flag and give more raised up a little bit more.",,,
803,0.7106125354766846,5102.2,5104.8,So I would turn that over to your discretion Madam chair.,,,
804,0.7106125354766846,5104.8,5106.9,If that's the direction you'd like to go.,,,
805,0.7106125354766846,5108.1,5114.7,"Yeah, I think this is a good opportunity to hear more from our accountability Partners.",,,
806,0.7106125354766846,5115.4,5119.7,We did have them in sit in September to talk about their recommendations but now that,,,
807,0.8454710245132446,5119.8,5128.6, We're getting more I think in the weeds and becoming more more familiar with some of these Concepts.,,,
808,0.8454710245132446,5129.2,5131.8,I would definitely feel that.,,,
809,0.8454710245132446,5132.4,5142.7,There would be value added if council members have specific questions about recommendations and even if not if the representatives here have,,,
810,0.9128386974334717,5145.4,5153.2, Feedback that they would like to offer that we haven't already covered as part of these Central staff presentation.,,,
811,0.8900818824768066,5157.3,5158.6," Well, I think from opiates respective.",,,
812,0.8900818824768066,5158.6,5165.1,"One thing I would note is that and I think everyone's aware of this when these recommendations were issued, it was fairly early on in the process.",,,
813,0.8900818824768066,5165.1,5168.0,So I think we issued them in July.,,,
814,0.8900818824768066,5168.3,5171.5,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was in July at that point.",,,
815,0.8900818824768066,5171.5,5179.5,"We really had not been able to dig through the vast, majority of the cases involve the use of last balls and other Leslie Pools.",,,
816,0.8900818824768066,5179.8,5186.9,In the early days of the protests we have since issued several findings including two.,,,
817,0.8841881155967712,5187.1,5207.0, Staying findings for the use of last Fall's and we have identified other concerns with possible usage and I think our thought is that we will be supplementing our report and maybe not a formal report but certainly supplementing our recommendations and now have lessons learned from the actual investigations that we've concluded.,,,

1034,0.8934986591339111,6797.6,6797.8, Sure.,,,
1035,0.8934986591339111,6798.1,6798.7,And that's it.,,,
1036,0.8934986591339111,6798.7,6799.6,That's a great question.,,,
1037,0.8934986591339111,6799.6,6804.0,So the policies that we're putting out are not new policies.,,,
1038,0.8934986591339111,6804.3,6808.0,All of our policies are online and publicly accessible.,,,
1039,0.8934986591339111,6808.7,6827.3,"Every year we do a review of some of our core policies, specifically around use of force and that's on an annual review cycle we accept recommendations throughout the year whether it's through, you know, IG audit in Opa management,",,,

1042,0.8866202235221863,6836.6,6838.6,We revised policy accordingly.,,,
1043,0.8866202235221863,6838.6,6846.2,As part of just a regular iterative review of policies and learning from incidents over the prior year.,,,
1044,0.8866202235221863,6846.2,6848.6,Around this time.,,,

1046,0.8488379120826721,6858.0,6871.4," It becomes essentially tweaks to policy because you've reached this iterative point of Reform, those policies then, go to the doj and the monitoring team, the oig OPA.",,,
1047,0.8488379120826721,6871.4,6878.4,"And the CPC for their review, their red lines, their comments to those policies.",,,

1049,0.8488379120826721,6883.2,6887.2,I believe following that we generally sit down.,,,

1051,0.9128383994102478,6903.3,6911.6,"Again, we start collecting recommendations and those will inform the next year's iteration with respect to crowd management.",,,
1052,0.9128383994102478,6911.6,6917.1,I think what we learned this summer is that we need to do.,,,
1053,0.8021523952484131,6917.8,6933.2," A better job of articulating, our crowd management policy and there were substantial lessons learned over the summer and that we continue to learn from Opa in the oig and some of the litigation that since doing that is informing the revisions to those policies.",,,
1054,0.8021523952484131,6933.5,6943.2,And so the crowd management policy you'll see is quite a bit more revised this year and updated it was substantive than in Prior years less.,,,
1055,0.8021523952484131,6943.2,6947.2,"So with the use of force policies, but the crowd management",,,
1056,0.8615917563438416,6947.4,6948.1, Policy as well.,,,
1057,0.8615917563438416,6948.1,6957.2,We'll go through the same review cycle with our accountability partners and with the federal Monitor and the doj,,,
1058,0.9128383994102478,6958.7,6970.5," And we put these, you know, there's been a lot of discussion over the past few years as to how do we get community input into SPD policy into SPD training in.",,,
1059,0.9128383994102478,6970.8,6988.2,"I believe part of the purpose of the, you know, codifying the CPC was to create that body as the forum for engaging with community and seeking Community engagement with SPD Opa and oig as well also have their community outreach specialists.",,,
1060,0.9029319882392883,6988.8,6993.8," At the same time we hear a lot from Community, we receive emails.",,,
1061,0.9029319882392883,6993.8,7001.3,"We received letters really across the whole range of opinion, and we try to balance those as well.",,,
1062,0.9029319882392883,7002.1,7018.2,So as some other departments have had a past practice of putting out policies for review by the community and given where we are in the consent decree process and the clear interest of the community in reviewing these policies.,,,
1063,0.8772155046463013,7018.5,7025.0, We made the decision to give that a try and put the policies out publicly for Community feedback as well.,,,

1065,0.814850389957428,7027.5,7029.6,Becca Shaylee and I see your hand is up.,,,

1068,0.814850389957428,7033.3,7055.7,"If I may to the first piece that Rebecca was speaking to you, where we talk about the ways in which officers show up at a demonstration, we mentioned a report that Seattle has over 300 demonstrations in a year and so one of our recommendations was the city needs to take a really hard look at how they show up at what particular demonstrations and",,,
1069,0.8882401585578918,7055.9,7060.5, And who's demonstrating the ones that have happened in these recent months have been?,,,

1071,0.8882401585578918,7071.4,7074.3,And then sometimes you have counter-protesters what we hear from community.,,,
1072,0.8882401585578918,7074.3,7081.6,"And what we also see is sometimes the way officers show up, not just in riot gear, but if counter protesters are present, who are they facing?",,,
1073,0.8882401585578918,7082.0,7085.2,"I think we were, we are on this this virtual space",,,

1075,0.9066027402877808,7092.1,7095.4,And so I would urge everyone to pay attention to videos.,,,
1076,0.9066027402877808,7095.6,7099.8,The people that have spoken out about this and the pictures that have been taken on what that looks like.,,,
1077,0.9066027402877808,7100.2,7109.6,"And then, let's have an honest conversation with community and get their thoughts and their feelings and their experiences on what that was like for them.",,,
1078,0.9066027402877808,7109.6,7111.9,Instead of us just talking about it because I can talk about videos.,,,
