38,0.97,281.614,284.417,Moving on to my committee agenda.,5,,
39,0.97,284.417,291.157,Just starting off with a clerk file that is on the full council agenda sponsored by myself Councilmember Peterson.,5,,
40,0.97,291.157,303.636,It will ensure that facial recognition technology is considered surveillance technology and therefore subject to the rigors of the city's surveillance ordinance.,5,,
41,0.97,303.636,320.153,I think this last week that during a recent OPA the director concluded that an officer's use of facial recognition technology was not in violation of the city's surveillance ordinance.,5,,
42,0.97,320.153,348.047,I disagreed with this analysis and believe through discussions with Council central staff and conversations with the city law Department that the facial recognition technology is fully within the jurisdiction and Purview of the surveillance ordinance . meaning the use of the technology is currently prohibited unless reviewed and approved as described in the surveillance ordinance.,5,,
43,0.97,348.047,359.926,"But in order to, moving forward, eliminate any future can with their facial recognition technology whether it's covered by surveillance counsel Pedersen and I brought forth this clerk file to settle the question.",5,,
44,0.97,359.926,361.094,Just a little more background.,5,,
45,0.97,361.094,385.952,"When the use of the surveillance with facial recognition technology was brought to the public's attention at that time chief Diaz, this was back in November of 2020, keep Diaz wrote that the Department did not use Clearview ai, which is the facial recognition technology and had no intention of using Clearview ai.",5,,
46,0.97,385.952,399.399,"He wrote, as chief I'm committed to upholding the tenants of the surveillance ordinance and the celebrities of our residents . Clearview ai business product is that odd with those two central priorities.",5,,
47,0.97,399.399,409.942,"Other, may request at the time the Department sent out a Departmentwide medication reminding everyone in SPD about the policy.",5,,
48,0.97,409.942,416.549,Making clear that one cannot use personal technology as a means to bypass the city policies.,5,,
49,0.97,416.549,430.63,"The chief at a later date publicly indicated that it was a gray area, saying that it is not in Ds's position that the surveillance ordinance codified covers the use of facial recognition software.",5,,
50,0.97,430.63,442.742,The clerk before the city council on Monday will ensure that in the future the surveillance ordinance does indeed cover the use of facial technologies and will be subject to the review process outlined within the ordinance.,5,,
51,0.97,442.742,450.883,A couple of other items related to my upcoming committee.,5,,
52,0.97,450.883,456.489,I just want to let folks know that public safety and human services committee is meeting tomorrow at 9:30 A.M.,5,,

59,0.97,497.897,541.974,This is the work of the interdepartmental team that came together after the Mayor's office enacted the executive order and last year and long- awaited work for looking at what policing activities can be done by other Nonpolice employees and looking at other items that the counselor has identified through the budget process and through some statements of legislative intent . I want to just talk a little bit about public safety issues in general.,5,,
60,0.97,541.974,565.598,"On Sunday, sadly, we know that there were shootings that left two people dead and six injured beginning in the very early hours of Sunday and going into late Sunday.",5,,

65,0.97,579.312,591.023,I just want to lift up chief Diaz's statement yesterday that people armed with guns are preying on our communities and every shooting victim is one too many.,5,,
66,0.97,591.023,592.425,Families are losing loved ones and their trauma is real.,5,,
67,0.97,592.425,599.799,"However, lessening the devastation that is happening on our streets and our homes is not something SPD can do alone.",5,,
68,0.97,599.799,609.041,"We need Evryone from friends, family, and friends to put down their weapons and find ways other than violence to resolve their issues.",5,,
69,0.97,609.041,610.443,This is something we all need to do together.,5,,
70,0.97,610.443,628.628,"I know we all are asking everyone to encourage them everyone that we know, leave their weapons at home and look to find other ways to resolve conflict.",5,,
71,0.97,628.628,644.777,These shootings required SPD to utilize all available officers from first and third . In addition to the crisis response group to respond to these four separate incidents and other calls that were coming in at the same time.,5,,
72,0.97,644.777,653.786,"This comes as we have seen significant increases in violence nationally, here in Seattle, and in the region.",5,,
73,0.97,653.786,659.992,Nationally Homicides rose 30% and gun assaults rose 8% in large cities in 2020.,5,,
74,0.97,659.992,671.27,We all know that black and Brown Americans are just Disproportionally harmed by the direct and indirect consequences of gun violence.,5,,
75,0.97,671.27,679.612,I am encouraged that Seattle is joining the regional approach to addressing gun violence.,5,,
76,0.97,679.612,693.559,"Last week the Mayor's office announced an intent to support a $2 million investment in King County's regional Peacekeepers collective, matching a similar investment by the county.",5,,
77,0.97,693.559,708.441,I am looking at Frontloading some of that investment in the 2021 budget and considering an amendment to the supplemental budget that is currently before the Council.,5,,
78,0.97,708.441,717.95,Appropriate a portion of the intended $2 million investment.,5,,
79,0.97,717.95,721.954,I'm looking at a portion of that investment going out the door this year.,5,,
80,0.97,721.954,734.366,The regional Peacekeepers addresses bounce using a public health approach and it is working to provide rigorous intervention for those critically involved.,5,,

89,0.97,823.822,834.767,This investment is a critical piece of counsel's answer to consistent calls from community to invest in alternatives to policing.,5,,

95,0.97,899.832,910.743,The more calls that we take out of the 911 response system to better response times will improve for police officers to respond to 911 calls that only they can take.,5,,
96,0.97,910.743,945.177,"Again, the Mayor enacted an order last year . The council passed a similar station statement with legislative intent to look at what types of calls can be diverted away from our police officers, so that police officers can do a more effective and efficient job of receiving the calls only they can take that triage one proposal is one small element expected that much broader analysis that is scheduled to be heard on Tuesday.",5,,

258,0.97,2199.297,2205.67,"I appreciate the diligence of the Seattle police Department in identifying and Apprehending the suspects certainly, they should be held accountable.",15,,
259,0.97,2205.67,2224.722,I think that we need to continue on with our efforts in collaboration with our Federal partners to really make sure that we are developing and building the types of Community- based programs that we know are necessary to prevent gun violence from happening in the first place.,15,,
260,0.97,2224.722,2235.566,Police investigations and police involvement are necessary and essential to hold people accountable when they do violate the social contract and commit gun violence.,15,,
261,0.97,2235.566,2240.771,We know those police actions do not in and of themselves prevent gun violence.,15,,
262,0.97,2240.771,2276.474,"We know that the action that prevents gun violence that we have seen time and time again to the great work of our community partners like Dominique Davis, that Mentorship, community building, mutual understanding and the work that community passages is doing, committee Passageways is doing, has a profound impact in enhancing our togetherness and making sure that through Mentorship we can come together and rise above the divisions in our community that lead to gun violence.",15,,
263,0.97,2276.474,2301.098,And I just want to give a shout out to Mayor Durkan and Councilmember Herbold in the really big programmatic increases in the number of public safety programs over the past couple of weeks that as they get stood up are going to make a very discernible difference in the community building activities that we know can prevent these shootings from occurring in the first place.,15,,
