31,0.97,249.382,253.653,I really enjoyed being able to learn more about the city and the Lgbtq community in the city.,10,,
32,0.97,253.653,260.96,And I am really eager to continue doing the work that we started previously.,10,,
33,0.97,260.96,281.514,Some of the highlights of working on the Commission the past year has been cheering the community outreach committee and being able to lead that committee through our pandemic response and the responding to the black lives matter protests in the summer.,10,,
34,0.97,281.514,290.423,And being able to work with community organizations impacted by the issues that have happened this last year to see how we can support them.,10,,
35,0.97,290.423,322.322,"My favorite milestone has been working with Hannah from the disabilities Commission on putting together a panel, a Townhall panel featuring activists who are Lgbtq and who have disabilities speaking to life at the intersection of those identities and as somebody with a disability this is a topic of interest that I'm hoping we can continue to push on into next year.",10,,

37,0.97,327.16,335.468,Some of the reasons I'm hoping to stay on the Commission is I'm hoping to increase transparency between the Commission and the Lgbtq community.,10,,
38,0.97,335.468,351.484,We have had a lot of feedback last year that transparency is not there and a lot of people do not trust the work we did or the thought process so I'm hoping we can kind of Demystify some of that for the Lgbtq community.,10,,
39,0.97,351.484,381.214,"Hoping to keep experiences and perspectives in decision-making processes and continue on and Antiracist journey and also personal interests of mine are Healthcare, we are lucky to live in a Lgbtq friendly city with a lot of great Healthcare resources for them but that does not mean they are Lgbtq competent.",10,,
40,0.97,381.214,401.2,"So trying to work on what does it mean to be competent when providing care meaning you don't ever to a Trans patient by their dead name, those types of things and working with community organizations to come up with standards that can be adopted by Healthcare organizations like what does it mean to be competent when providing care?",10,,
41,0.97,401.2,403.936,Not just friendly.,10,,
42,0.97,403.936,407.607,So that's some of the reasons why am hoping to stay on the Commission.,10,,

47,0.97,450.249,455.755,"Yes, so I think there are several things.",12,,
48,0.97,455.755,512.245,"First increasing transparency by using social media or other platforms that are utilized by younger demographics and really trying to foster a two-way dialogue through those platforms . So, before joining the Commission, it was hard to find information about the Lgbtq Commission or just the Commission in general, different commissions in general so I think one of the things that the city and the Commission could be doing better is again Leveraging those platforms and trying to communicate through those and soliciting feedback from people using Instagram, Tiktok and Facebook.",12,,
49,0.97,512.245,513.846,"Great, thank you.",13,,
50,0.97,513.846,521.754,"Colleagues, any questions?",13,,

96,0.97,940.639,960.159,Those might not sound like they have a direct impact to women's health or the work that the women's Commission is doing but mental and emotional health and the stress is disproportionately Impacting women in multiple ways.,22,,

160,0.97,1455.153,1476.474,"I am an attorney now, I want to be on the Commission because I have been in my job as a leading representative since I have worked with a couple of you guys before but I have been doing this long enough I felt I could branch out and take on more so I figured what better place to start than my own community.",39,,
161,0.97,1476.474,1478.91,Not a good place to end but a good place to start.,39,,
162,0.97,1478.91,1483.582,I saw the posting and decided to go for it.,39,,
163,0.97,1483.582,1490.489,The biggest issues that I think are facing the community.,39,,
164,0.97,1490.489,1492.724,Definitely Transgender rights.,39,,
165,0.97,1492.724,1503.034,When we talk about the Lgbtq community still see a disproportionate effect on Transgender brothers and sisters.,39,,
166,0.97,1503.034,1509.741,I believe when you help the most depressed it rises the tide for everybody.,39,,
167,0.97,1509.741,1514.045,Regardless of gender or race.,39,,
168,0.97,1514.045,1523.154,So aside from that I think there is a lot of substance abuse issues within the Lgbtq community.,39,,
169,0.97,1523.154,1530.328,It's not a fun subject to talk about but it is prevalent and I think it needs to be addressed.,39,,
170,0.97,1530.328,1532.33,It goes Hand-In-Hand with mental health.,39,,
171,0.97,1532.33,1539.437,You know it's kind of which came first to both of the issues are pretty near and dear to my heart.,39,,
172,0.97,1539.437,1556.154,I am relatively new so I like to learn from a colleagues who have been doing this longer than I have so rather than coming in with an agenda and how to do it I plan on doing some listening and learning.,39,,
173,0.97,1556.154,1563.395,"So, this you know general plan that I have is subject to change as I learn.",39,,
174,0.97,1563.395,1573.972,What I hope to accomplish I guess it's a Clichc but if I could really even help one person then it is worth it.,39,,
175,0.97,1573.972,1576.808,Hopefully we do more than that but even one person makes it worth it.,39,,
176,0.97,1576.808,1585.317,"So, Yeah that's what and why want to be on the Lgbtq Commission.",39,,
177,0.97,1585.317,1586.184,"Thank you, Steven.",40,,
178,0.97,1586.184,1594.693,Colleagues any questions? I am not seeing any.,40,,
179,0.97,1594.693,1598.296,Councilmember Sawant has something to say.,41,,
180,0.97,1598.296,1608.54,Thank you.,42,,
181,0.97,1610.575,1615.614,"So, thank you Steven for what you were saying.",42,,
182,0.97,1615.614,1622.12,"Yes, Capitol Hill is indeed in district three.",42,,
183,0.97,1622.12,1643.875,"Actually, it is really interesting you mentioned Capitol not only because you live there but because as you correctly talked about the needs of the Lgbtq community as a whole but specifically the need to fight against the oppression of the trends community.",42,,
184,0.97,1643.875,1668.6,"And I think that really coincides with a conversation about Capitol Hill and the core of the city and that this falls on, you know it's very relevant to District 3 but not just district 3. it is a citywide question but the point is Capitol Hill used to be really the neighborhood where the Lgbtq community came of its own.",42,,
185,0.97,1668.6,1685.884,"It has a rich history of activism in the 80s especially in the fight against AIDS, the fight to have research done on this, this you know really tragedy that was Devouring the community.",42,,
186,0.97,1685.884,1688.987,And really raising awareness.,42,,
187,0.97,1688.987,1728.96,"It was not only a question of science, it was a question of political activism and then of course after that, fighting for the referendum 74 and Capitol Hill being the space were the first trends group was organized and am proud and honored my office has had the track record of being the only candidate, at that time in 2013 when I was running for office to have joined and since then of course it has really gained a lot of momentum but also there is a long way to go.",42,,
188,0.97,1728.96,1751.282,"So I was eager to hear about what you think you know in terms of your role and the Lgbtq Commission, it's role, it does have a role and has taken courageous and even controversial positions and that is going to be more and more important as we go on.",42,,
189,0.97,1751.282,1758.79,I think the advocacy of the Commission around housing Affordability and this is what I meant about Capitol Hill.,42,,
190,0.97,1758.79,1773.204,"The rent is so high that some of the people who made this community and this neighborhood, many of them have been pushed out of the neighborhood entirely and permanently.",42,,
191,0.97,1773.204,1781.212,Not to mention the scourge of homelessness that is hitting so many neighbors.,42,,
192,0.97,1781.212,1786.017,I think the Commission has a historic role to play now in the coming days.,42,,
193,0.97,1786.017,1791.322,Not only limiting itself to local issues but really raising your voice on the need for Medicare for all.,42,,
194,0.97,1791.322,1797.195,That covers gender and gender health and this is a pivotal moment.,42,,
195,0.97,1797.195,1800.031,We have a Democratic administration in the White House.,42,,
196,0.97,1800.031,1803.535,We have Democratic control in Congress.,42,,
197,0.97,1803.535,1813.711,It would be a tragedy if we squander this moment so I think activists like your self and the role you play will be crucial.,42,,
198,0.97,1813.711,1817.949,"I would like to hear your thoughts on what you think, you think this could really blossom.",42,,
199,0.97,1817.949,1823.621,"Yes, thank you for the questions and comments.",43,,
200,0.97,1823.621,1826.658,Thank you for your Li ship.,43,,
201,0.97,1826.658,1831.829,I know you have been representing Capitol Hill and fighting for Lgbtq rights.,43,,
202,0.97,1831.829,1839.27,"In terms of housing Affordability you are right, if somebody rents in Capitol Hill it is expensive.",43,,
203,0.97,1839.27,1848.379,We have a big Lgbtq presence.,43,,
204,0.97,1848.379,1866.664,It is problematic for what is a safe haven and a safe neighborhood has been filled with a lot of people who look like me and that has displaced a lot of people but I think that gets to the next question about what we can do.,43,,
205,0.97,1866.664,1870.568,Absolutely we should look at this big picture.,43,,
206,0.97,1870.568,1874.806,I'm fortunate to live in the city of Seattle and Capitol Hill.,43,,
207,0.97,1874.806,1894.492,If you were to throw a Dart on the map of the best places to live for Lgbtq person and you hit Capitol Hill that is a Lotto ticket so I understand I am privileged to be where I am and I would love to you Seattle as an example for a lot of other cities that have a lot of work to do.,43,,
208,0.97,1894.492,1905.236,I mean we have work to do but we have done a lot of great work we need to be proud of and really be used as a model across the United States.,43,,
209,0.97,1905.236,1922.253,"We do have Democratic majority in Federal and at the state level and I do think at the Federal level, people voted and gave what I think was mandate for reason and there needs to be follow through on a host of issues.",43,,
210,0.97,1922.253,1943.041,So I mean for the sake of brevity there's a lot of things we could do at the Federal level but I am in solidarity with you that you know helping Lgbtq people everywhere is a key thing for all of us and I hope we can deliver at the state and Federal level.,43,,
211,0.97,1943.041,1949.38,I'm a little newer to the Commission but I'm hopeful we can work together to accomplish what you have talked about.,43,,
212,0.97,1949.38,1955.853,Thank you.,44,,
213,0.97,1955.853,1966.397,Seattle has a history of leading the charge on some really progressive things and I think this is another example of a place where we have the platform and the ability to make some movement.,44,,
214,0.97,1966.397,1968.666,Look forward to hearing back from all of you.,44,,
215,0.97,1968.666,1974.706,Okay let's move on to Brett.,44,,
216,0.97,1974.706,1984.382,Brett is seeking appointment on the Commission and has been attending meetings regularly including the annual retreat so I will handed over to Brett,45,,
217,0.97,1984.382,1988.119,Goodman everyone.,46,,
218,0.97,1988.119,1991.622,My name is Brett Pepowski.,46,,
219,0.97,1991.622,2008.006,I used to live in Chicago and moved here to be close to some community organizations whose commissions I really value and I'm a proud district 3 resident.,46,,
220,0.97,2008.006,2023.921,Academically my background is in biology and research but I have been working more in the teaching and social services region so used to tutor and be a teaching aid at a public high school and I have worked in some shelters and permanent supportive housing.,46,,
221,0.97,2023.921,2026.057,Now I work in the downtown emergency service center.,46,,
222,0.97,2026.057,2034.866,I get people to doctors appointments and I'm on the Anti-Covid team for the internal public health group.,46,,
223,0.97,2034.866,2043.007,In my out of work life I have been involved in a number of volunteer and community activities.,46,,
224,0.97,2043.007,2059.857,The reason I want to serve on the Commission is because in my career I have focused a little bit more on helping individuals and I have realized I started popping up systems that are designed to fail or only work halfway.,46,,
225,0.97,2059.857,2082.814,I would like to get away from propping up those systems and start Redesigning those systems so that they work better and didn't want to have tutors and teaching aids and case managers because they will work without those things . I would like to amplify my community voices to inform representatives how they can affect those changes.,46,,
226,0.97,2082.814,2098.429,What I see is some of the biggest problems not just in the Lgbtq community but in marginalized communities or really the entire United States is people essentially have to earn the right to be a life.,46,,
227,0.97,2098.429,2103.935,"Housing, food, medical care are treated as luxuries and they're just human rights.",46,,
228,0.97,2103.935,2107.605,Everyone should be able to access them.,46,,
229,0.97,2107.605,2122.22,"I would like to work on increasing access to that at the local level for now, so increasing access to affordable housing, preventing food deserts and helping people get to food banks as needed.",46,,
230,0.97,2122.22,2135.166,"Things like that and also increasing education in general medical access for trends people especially and disabled people, those are really important.",46,,
231,0.97,2135.166,2139.07,I want to hold people accountable.,46,,
232,0.97,2139.07,2153.284,I think this past summer has shown a lot of issues in the government where there were tons of community activists calling for the Defunding of police and that has kind of fallen through.,46,,
233,0.97,2153.284,2166.497,We have made demands very clear and has not happened to the extent that it needs to happen and that is true with other issues like taxing big big business and increasing affordable housing.,46,,
234,0.97,2166.497,2178.476,So I am here to remind people of committee demands to amplify community voices and to pass that on to officials and to hold people accountable.,46,,
235,0.97,2178.476,2181.512,And I expect to be held accountable at the same time.,46,,
236,0.97,2181.512,2184.115,Those are the things I hope to accomplish.,46,,
237,0.97,2184.115,2185.816,Thank you for having me here.,46,,
238,0.97,2185.816,2189.42,Thank you so much.,47,,
239,0.97,2189.42,2199.63,It is shameful and you are right in many cases people have to demonstrate they have a right to be alive and that is part of the system.,47,,
240,0.97,2199.63,2214.745,"All the systems that are Oppressing people, that's part of what we're trying to dismantle so thank you for your advocacy and your willingness to hold us accountable to keep moving in that direction.",47,,
241,0.97,2214.745,2221.852,Any questions for Brett?,47,,
242,0.97,2221.852,2225.022,Councilmember Sawant.,47,,
243,0.97,2225.022,2227.858,Not so much a question.,48,,
244,0.97,2227.858,2232.063,Just to register my appreciation for the comments made.,48,,
245,0.97,2232.063,2256.887,"Especially highlighting the fact that, especially there may be a little bit, this may be a subjective question in some minds but I really appreciate Brett describing the role is actually holding elected officials accountable.",48,,
246,0.97,2256.887,2260.891,That is the way we would see it through my office.,48,,
247,0.97,2260.891,2272.903,That is the role and that's why I was mentioning earlier sometimes commissioners have to take courageous or controversial positions on work that will not be easy but I think that would be the correct thing to do.,48,,
248,0.97,2272.903,2279.41,You would much rather do the correcting not the easy thing and so I really appreciate you mentioning that.,48,,
249,0.97,2279.41,2310.107,I wanted you to know that my staff and I will always be a place where you can turn to in the sense that we have a track record of not shying away from difficult things in real not chosen the easy thing to do and I think the difficult things are the things to be done especially as people are struggling and it is our job.,48,,
250,0.97,2310.107,2312.243,It is our duty to fight for them.,48,,
251,0.97,2312.243,2350.748,"I appreciate you mentioning the question of taxing big business because yes the Council did the right thing last summer by passing the Amazon tax but that is not enough and in fact the question of covert relief does come up now and if you look at the profits some of the corporations have made, in fact with the city is now raising is a big business tax will not be enough and it is a life question so it is important that you mention that.",48,,
252,0.97,2350.748,2360.891,It has to include the question of creating green jobs on a big scale and of course I would echo what was said is these questions are at the state and Federal level.,48,,
253,0.97,2360.891,2369.8,"The more we are able to win on the city level, it creates momentum and pressure on elected officials at the state and Federal level.",48,,
254,0.97,2369.8,2374.605,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,49,,
255,0.97,2374.605,2377.274,Any final comments?,49,,
256,0.97,2377.274,2379.577,Okay.,49,,
257,0.97,2379.577,2384.014,I'm going to try to get us through the last few quickly.,49,,

280,0.97,2521.752,2528.259,I have been on the Commission for about a year now do they get engaged program.,60,,
281,0.97,2528.259,2538.569,Outside of the Commission I currently am a bar manager at an urban farm called yes farm through the black farmers collective.,60,,
282,0.97,2538.569,2561.392,So grassroots organizing and figuring out ways to address issues of food justice and striving for food sovereignty for all identities.,60,,
283,0.97,2561.759,2614.144,I actually came to Seattle 5 1/2 years ago to study environmental science at the University of Washington and since then my work has been centered around environmental justice and climate justice in the ways marginalized communities are impacted first by issues of climate change and the reason why this work is important to me is because I am a deaf disabled queer black woman and this work has been heaving for me and has been important to see the ways I can bring that Intersectional lens to this work to make sure everyone who has marginalized identities is represented in the work that I do and in the work that the city does as well.,60,,
284,0.97,2614.144,2633.063,Like Nate said we had a great collaboration with the Lgbt Commission to create a panel of queer disabled activists and elevate their wisdom to share that with the Seattle community with the Townhall.,60,,
285,0.97,2633.063,2643.474,I want to continue doing that type of education work as a way to recruit more folks to the disability Commission and elevate those voices.,60,,
286,0.97,2643.474,2646.076,Unit because they are needed more than ever.,60,,
287,0.97,2646.076,2673.704,The other thing I want to do is also try to address the challenges with giving the on housed community in Seattle more resources because a large portion of the on housed community in Seattle is disabled or represent other marginalized communities so I'm very curious about the ways we can work with other commissions and the city to address that as well.,60,,
288,0.97,2673.704,2677.508,"So, thank you for having me.",60,,
289,0.97,2677.508,2680.377,As I continue my work with the disability Commission.,60,,

309,0.97,2807.337,2807.738,Thank you.,68,,
310,0.97,2807.738,2852.049,"I am really excited to have the director here, the interim director and as we think about ways to address the history of racial inequality in our city about to support community driven development and increase opportunity for business ownership and land ownership the project we are about to hear about offers a compelling example of how we can do that and demonstrates that it is possible to center racial equity as we are making public investment that will create economic opportunity.",68,,
311,0.97,2852.049,2862.192,I want to handed over to the folks at the office of arts and culture to share their plans for the PDA and cultural space agency and look forward to hearing your comments.,68,,
312,0.97,2862.192,2865.495,I will hand over to you guys.,68,,
313,0.97,2865.495,2868.699,Thank you so much Councilmember Morales.,69,,
314,0.97,2868.699,2870.901,Thank you on the Council for making time for us today.,69,,
315,0.97,2870.901,2880.377,"I am Randy Engstrom, for seven more days I am the director for the office of arts and culture.",69,,
316,0.97,2880.377,2881.912,Three things quickly.,69,,
317,0.97,2881.912,2889.82,For several say thank you to the Council because I spent six years on the Seattle arts Commission going back to 2005.,69,,
318,0.97,2889.82,2893.49,8 1/2 years in this job.,69,,
319,0.97,2893.49,2897.828,Councilmember Morales I worked with you starting in the Youngstown days when I was in arts Commissioner.,69,,
320,0.97,2897.828,2907.104,And Councilmember Lewis I am reminded of you visiting King Street station shortly after you were elected.,69,,
321,0.97,2907.104,2918.448,"So as book ends the Council has been such an incredible partner to me as an advocate, volunteer Commissioner and director so thank you for the work you do.",69,,
322,0.97,2918.448,2926.556,Thank you for your values and for believing in arts and culture because your partnership made a lot of this possible.,69,,
323,0.97,2926.556,2931.061,Secondly I want to introduce Calandra Childers who has been my deputy director for seven years.,69,,
324,0.97,2931.061,2935.365,My absolute partner in crime in every way.,69,,
325,0.97,2935.365,2936.934,Someone who I have the utmost confidence in.,69,,
326,0.97,2936.934,2946.843,She is brilliant and collaborative and trusted and I have all the faith in the world and her leadership to carry this office through the next year and whatever changes may come.,69,,
327,0.97,2946.843,2955.452,Finally to introduce the host of the next 25 minutes or so Mr. Matthew Richter.,69,,
328,0.97,2955.452,2957.688,The liaison for the city of Seattle.,69,,
329,0.97,2957.688,2967.798,The only cultural space liaison in the United States and the Pro-Generator of the cultural space program out of which the cultural space agency was born.,69,,
330,0.97,2967.798,2988.385,"When I was interviewing Matthew in my office as a finalist for this role, he said that what he would try to do when he came to the job was thrown about 30 ideas at the wall and see what would stick and then those ideas would be the policies we would use to advance Affordability in the city.",69,,
331,0.97,2988.385,3009.906,"Several years later in 2017 we published the cap report, 30 ideas and one of the ideas was so interesting it warranted its own report, the idea of creating a public development authority specifically to act as a real estate intermediary to build community wealth and preserve cultural space.",69,,
332,0.97,3009.906,3017.247,So with that I hand it over to Mr. Matthew Richter with talk to you about the cultural space.,69,,
333,0.97,3017.247,3019.85,"Thank you, good morning.",70,,
334,0.97,3019.85,3024.254,I will share my screen and begin the Powerpoint presentation.,70,,
335,0.97,3024.254,3030.56,Thumbs up if folks can see the first light of the presentation.,70,,
336,0.97,3030.56,3031.428,Thank you.,70,,
337,0.97,3031.428,3044.641,I want to start by saying clearly community needs are so different this year than they were before Covid and that they will be after so I want to acknowledge that elephant in this room.,70,,
338,0.97,3044.641,3065.295,Cultural communities have responded by building experimental structures for belonging and connection as we stare at each other through these machines but as we recover and venture out and to gather and celebrate its these spaces that will lead the way back to a functional and civic life.,70,,
339,0.97,3065.295,3076.506,It was pointed out to me the roaring 20s followed the 1918 pandemic and it is cultural communities that will drive that return in the coming years.,70,,
340,0.97,3076.506,3092.122,What we hope to do is to create a structure to which cultural communities of color can benefit in a literal way from the Renaissance that they create.,70,,
341,0.97,3092.122,3100.63,"First, why are we organizing this work around cultural space and strategy for supporting community wealth building?",70,,
342,0.97,3100.63,3115.545,We have found the presence of a cultural space and of activity and neighborhoods drives these vibrancy Metrics and I put giant air quotes around vibrancy Metrics.,70,,
343,0.97,3115.545,3125.755,What you see on the site is a cultural space driving economic development that drives community cohesion and neighborhood identity.,70,,
344,0.97,3125.755,3134.965,These numbers compare one block in Seattle with a cultural space to an equivalent block without a cultural space.,70,,
345,0.97,3134.965,3143.473,Also as we start saying a piece about how we define cultural space and we bring a broad definition.,70,,
346,0.97,3143.473,3158.388,"We're talking about the galleries, the Feeders and the Cinemas but also the artist studios, community meeting spaces, small businesses, record shops and Barbershops.",70,,
347,0.97,3158.388,3162.392,Cultural community centers.,70,,
348,0.97,3162.392,3163.527,Community facing small businesses.,70,,
349,0.97,3163.527,3167.497,Which are to be as inclusive as we can be.,70,,
350,0.97,3167.497,3177.474,We intend to follow the guidance around pornography which is while it's hard to nail down the definition you know one when you see one.,70,,
351,0.97,3177.474,3197.594,We have been doing this ongoing needs assessment around cultural space and what you can see reflects a list developed through a series of regular touch points so we have the annual conference called square feet Seattle.,70,,
352,0.97,3197.594,3204.234,We do regular surveys Online engaging hundreds of people with racial equity Toolkits on the cultural space.,70,,
353,0.97,3204.234,3208.305,We have one on this project.,70,,
354,0.97,3208.305,3227.057,We do a asset mapping project with the base Cohort equitably certification Cohort program for districts and citywide culture and it's one of the more Inter-Departmental bodies of work I have come across in the city of Seattle.,70,,
355,0.97,3227.057,3230.46,What is a public development authority?,70,,
356,0.97,3230.46,3238.568,The PDA mechanism was developed in Washington State to Steward real property free civic purpose.,70,,
357,0.97,3238.568,3245.675,The eight existing PDAS are listed and they are all mission organized around the creation of a type of space.,70,,
358,0.97,3245.675,3256.686,Either affordable housing or the preservation of historic landmarks or specific communities or other civic priorities.,70,,
359,0.97,3256.686,3265.395,"I have included dates of their family, a new PDA has not been launched in Seattle for almost 40 years.",70,,
360,0.97,3265.395,3270.066,This is the most interesting thing about the form a PDA is a governmental agency.,70,,
361,0.97,3270.066,3299.729,It is a owned subsidiary of city government it is subject to the same rules and restrictions which means you can transfer resources and property with or without consideration from the Rcw so it transfers within city government from one Department to another and I'm Oversimplifying that but the basic relationship is intended to be very close.,70,,
362,0.97,3299.729,3305.201,From another perspective these organizations have autonomy with independent decision-making power.,70,,
363,0.97,3305.201,3307.837,They can be responsive to community.,70,,
364,0.97,3307.837,3323.42,City Council approved the governing body and once approved these bodies are independent with liability shielding between the city and PDA so it's the best of both worlds for this kind of work.,70,,
365,0.97,3323.42,3333.63,It is important this slide show up is literally the first page of the Charter of the new organizational.,70,,
366,0.97,3333.63,3353.55,"The ideas and ideals that don't just live internally in the organization, the organization presents them very publicly and consistently and they were developed through communication and they are signal of the commitment back to communities.",70,,
367,0.97,3353.55,3356.986,Who runs this thing?,70,,
368,0.97,3356.986,3376.94,"We have been running the build arts space equitably Cohort so we have a group of 50 leaders, 20 in each year Cohort all from communities of color, specifically from real estate, arts and culture, Philanthropy, Finance etc.",70,,
369,0.97,3376.94,3384.814,This is a photo of the first Cohort graduating in the second on boarding.,70,,
370,0.97,3384.814,3410.573,"The folks who graduated the program are eligible to serve in the constituency of the new organization, the constituency will nominate all the potential governing Council members and that process has begun this month and it will continue in the spring when the constituency Resents to the Mayor and the will Mayor will present to you members.",70,,
371,0.97,3410.573,3420.15,City Council APPROVES all the PDA government members like the appointments you were doing earlier today.,70,,
372,0.97,3420.15,3426.856,The constituency is also the ambassadors for property opportunities and for program partnerships.,70,,
373,0.97,3426.856,3445.375,They Prioritize and recommend properties in programming to the staff and Council of the cultural space agency and what you can see on this slide are the types of spaces and site control on the left and similar types of potential programming partnerships on the right.,70,,
374,0.97,3445.375,3455.151,These are the spaces where the organization shows up and the activities that show up in those spaces.,70,,
375,0.97,3455.151,3467.23,This whole project is centered on the idea that the cultural communities that drive the creation of value or most desirable neighborhoods should take part in the growth of the value.,70,,
376,0.97,3467.23,3488.218,"So, as one of the advisors has said the measure most real estate organizations is the growth of the balance sheet of the increase Year-Over-Year in the square feet that it owns the measure of this organization will be the speed at which it transfers the ownership, square feet into the communities.",70,,
377,0.97,3488.218,3492.322,There are a lot of mechanisms for making that reality.,70,,
378,0.97,3492.322,3510.139,"Investment trusts, ownership partnerships of different kinds, there are partners to engage and leverage on behalf of community owners like social impact investors and the city portfolio of surplus property and you can see those ideas on this slide as well.",70,,
379,0.97,3510.139,3520.917,"The city arts office has committed $500,000 per year for the next two years to support startup operational costs.",70,,
380,0.97,3520.917,3531.06,We're also committing half of my time this coming year to supporting the constituency supporting the new Council and incoming staff.,70,,
381,0.97,3531.06,3549.979,We have explored the potential of bonding against a dedicated income stream within the arts budget which is a funding program that has been paused due to covert budget cuts but we hope to reopen its importance in the next couple years.,70,,
382,0.97,3549.979,3556.486,It was a big part of the community engagement did a over the last few years with the value of that support.,70,,
383,0.97,3556.486,3568.464,We are developing partnerships and have been for years with the equitable development pipeline projects and the office of housing pipeline of projects.,70,,
384,0.97,3568.464,3570.867,Before we close want to share some project types.,70,,
385,0.97,3570.867,3575.572,A caveat these are completely hypothetical.,70,,
386,0.97,3575.572,3584.914,"They do not have organizations or dresses connected, these are here to paint a fully realized picture of what we're talking about.",70,,
387,0.97,3584.914,3590.186,Any resemblance to actual cultural space is coincidental.,70,,
388,0.97,3590.186,3592.622,The first is a film festival center.,70,,
389,0.97,3592.622,3619.248,"Somewhere between 1017 film festivals are in town with no permanent dedicated space and each year they have to search for program space for celebration space, education space and Admin space so what if there was a home base for all the film festivals that every couple of weeks or every month was celebrating and centering different cultural communities.",70,,
390,0.97,3619.248,3626.756,"Like the Latino film Festival, Jewish film Festival, black film Festival, etc.",70,,
391,0.97,3626.756,3635.064,Artist studio clusters is one of the most in demand types of spaces.,70,,
392,0.97,3635.064,3637.767,"Studio space, rehearsal or recording space.",70,,
393,0.97,3637.767,3642.171,Also one of the most successful types of spaces in Seattle.,70,,
394,0.97,3642.171,3650.279,Some examples would be seen arts at home and city or the studios in West Georgetown.,70,,
395,0.97,3650.279,3655.785,They both say they have waiting lists three times longer than the actual capacity.,70,,
396,0.97,3655.785,3668.197,There is enormous demand in the space really builds resilience in the cultural community just in the proximity of sharing walls.,70,,
397,0.97,3668.197,3673.503,"This talks about the model for cultural space ownership, equity in these properties.",70,,
398,0.97,3673.503,3688.718,Where the agency would stand in as an intermediary owner that's mission driven to share the property over time to community members and to value assets that are not purely financial.,70,,
399,0.97,3688.718,3700.296,To value sweat equity and other types of capital that cultural communities can bring to the table in exchange for ownership.,70,,
400,0.97,3700.296,3706.736,There is this issue,70,,
401,0.97,3706.736,3726.856,"And we go back to the other slide? sorry did I Miss this, I'm looking at the slide and what I don't understand is what is the or a brand-new build to suit five over one?",71,,
402,0.97,3726.856,3736.032,"Entering into a development partnership, not just structures that exist, sorry that is written very casually.",72,,
403,0.97,3736.032,3746.375,"Not just looking at those that exist, five over one is a mixed building, five stories of apartments over Single-Story commercial space on the ground.",72,,
404,0.97,3746.375,3766.496,So we could look at develop partnerships and partner with a housing developer to create a Mixed-Use building including cultural space on the ground floor . where the ground floor would be owned by the cultural organizations.,72,,
405,0.97,3766.496,3777.273,Not only just obviously low income but mixed market rate Mixed-Use or mixed income?,73,,
406,0.97,3777.273,3783.446,The conversations we have been having are with affordable housing but it does not have to be restricted.,74,,
407,0.97,3783.446,3788.885,It could be a mix of income level units for sure.,74,,
408,0.97,3788.885,3795.191,We could work with a private developer for example.,74,,
409,0.97,3795.191,3805.034,The fears if you place this in areas where housing is more important than the cultural space or whatever then you don't want to see empty spaces.,75,,
410,0.97,3805.034,3809.539,Agreed.,76,,
411,0.97,3809.539,3819.115,I have seen this in Germany where they did Mixed-Use low income cultural space at the bottom with all the fanfare and it ended up not being used.,77,,
412,0.97,3819.115,3848.177,The reason why it caught my eye as we had to tour these areas where they took over the land and put in mixed rates and everyone loved it 10 years ago and then we walked through and they said something we did not realize his people were more concerned about wearing having somewhere to live so the cultural space was empty and you cannot live in it because it was not made for someone to live in.,77,,
413,0.97,3848.177,3851.981,So that's why I was looking at that.,77,,
414,0.97,3851.981,3858.354,I have looked at that project and I understand it.,78,,
415,0.97,3858.354,3890.82,"There was not a centralized mission driven organization that was Tasked with filling the space, it was left to the developers to have the market fill them in but this organization is specifically developing a portfolio of cultural partners to the constituency so even if the organization were to go in and something did not work out in year two or three or whatever, there would be a roster of organizational partnerships so the space is always activated.",78,,
416,0.97,3890.82,3896.092,It is on the space agency to consistently fill the space.,78,,
417,0.97,3896.092,3897.927,Which is a challenge.,78,,
418,0.97,3897.927,3907.436,Not saying it is easy but there is a whole organization mission driven to make it happen.,78,,
419,0.97,3907.436,3913.342,You're not waiting for organizations to show up with market forces behind them.,78,,
420,0.97,3913.342,3917.313,Gala space is one of the last presentations I want to point to.,78,,
421,0.97,3917.313,3927.156,"When Nonprofits throw Fundraisers typically anywhere from 5000 to $15,000 goes to the Venue.",78,,
422,0.97,3927.156,3933.262,The competition for these spaces like weddings and corporate Rollout events.,78,,
423,0.97,3933.262,3942.772,If you were to create a mission driven space to celebrate these organizations it would be full 350 nights a year.,78,,
424,0.97,3942.772,3944.707,This is one that does have some reality.,78,,
425,0.97,3944.707,3952.081,A project in motion around supporting the creative economy Ecosystem.,78,,
426,0.97,3952.081,3965.928,"A space that would combine the work of the office around creative industry, youth development and equitable space control.",78,,
427,0.97,3965.928,3968.097,A blended Footprint of youth serving organizations and independent artists.,78,,
428,0.97,3968.097,3973.102,We're happy to present more about that at a later date if that is of interest.,78,,
429,0.97,3973.102,3975.571,A Quicktime on.,78,,
430,0.97,3975.571,3986.682,"We spent the last three or four years exploring and authorizing, engaging with the community and running the Toolkit on the project.",78,,
431,0.97,3986.682,4000.129,This month we are forming the constituency and that constituency will deliver a slate of nominees for the governing Council to the Mayor and then we will hand them to you in the spring.,78,,
432,0.97,4000.129,4009.038,This summer the Council will engage in a hiring process and engage executive staff that we will be supporting through the office.,78,,
433,0.97,4009.038,4019.548,And then the initial projects and partnerships should be announced in the fall of 21 which should allow us to cut ribbons about one year later in the summer or fall of 22.,78,,
434,0.97,4019.548,4022.051,That ends the presentation.,78,,
435,0.97,4022.051,4032.561,I am happy with questions about a specific slide or I can stop the screen sure and we can have more of a conversation.,78,,
436,0.97,4032.561,4033.829,Thank you so much Matthew.,79,,
437,0.97,4033.829,4037.066,That was very exciting.,79,,
438,0.97,4037.066,4039.068,I do have a couple of questions.,79,,
439,0.97,4039.068,4044.774,Maybe we can go back to the Finance.,79,,
440,0.97,4044.774,4115.511,"Used to work at a financial intermediary for projects like this or entities like this so working with community development corporations, that mission driven piece you are talking about is the critical piece that's missing as Councilmember Juarez was saying the projects that lead to empty space on the ground floor and we have seen a lot of in my district with apartments above and then the Street-Level left blank and I think the critical piece is being intentional about designing that space or targeting a particular tenant or particular anchor tenant or others to be in there even if it is a small space for performance or production or rehearsal.",79,,
441,0.97,4115.511,4133.262,Having the PDA offers the ability to hold land and those decisions would be driven by communities requesting a particular space but the question is how do we buy it.,79,,
442,0.97,4133.262,4144.54,You mentioned on a different slide the community investment trust is one example of a Finance mechanism to do things like this.,79,,
443,0.97,4144.54,4150.179,Colleagues we will be hearing later in the year from the folks in Portland.,79,,
444,0.97,4150.179,4169.698,We have contracted with the mercy Corps folks in Portland to do a feasibility study in Seattle about how we could also create a community investment trust to allow for neighbors to buy shares into possible buildings like this.,79,,
445,0.97,4169.698,4177.406,"I wonder if you can talk a little about, sorry the previous slide building community wealth.",79,,
446,0.97,4177.406,4186.315,If you can talk a little bit about some of the different financing tools that could be used to support interest coming from the community.,79,,
447,0.97,4186.315,4193.822,The community investment trust and we've been talking to those folks in Portland.,80,,
448,0.97,4193.822,4202.631,"My sense is that's not the model where you develop the financing, the share of the financing comes from institutional sources.",80,,
449,0.97,4202.631,4209.305,The community investment trust is a mechanism for allowing minority share ownership in community.,80,,
450,0.97,4209.305,4217.846,These small thousand dollar shares that individuals can buy and be part of the neighborhood growth.,80,,
451,0.97,4217.846,4225.621,You mentioned working with them that's a great example of Ground-Floor activation.,80,,
452,0.97,4225.621,4241.837,With the exception of the downturn in 2008 and 2009 the Ground-Floor activation at the International district has remained consistently robust.,80,,
453,0.97,4241.837,4253.649,We have been having conversations with Cdf I like craft three another's represented in the base program directly.,80,,
454,0.97,4253.649,4271.8,With locally owned banks and credit unions to look at financing options and also the social impact investment groups like sentry capital a social justice centered investment trust.,80,,
455,0.97,4271.8,4306.702,"And I made mention in the Finance slide one of the mechanisms that we looked at Pre-Covid was using a fund within the arts office called the cultural facilities Fund and taking a portion, bonding against it creating a large pool of capital that the office would then pay down over a couple of decades through bond debt service by creating a pool of capital to invest in these spaces.",80,,
456,0.97,4306.702,4315.944,There are a couple different institutional streams to bring in large Infusions of capital to acquire these properties off the bat.,80,,
457,0.97,4315.944,4336.332,"Philanthropy also, we have been having conversations locally and nationally and Leveraging those three streams, city bonding potential social impact investment Philanthropy so I guess four streams because traditional lending as well on behalf of the community investment.",80,,
458,0.97,4336.332,4346.875,All four are mission driven to stand in as the capital as the community builds the capacity to buy out the shares from us.,80,,
459,0.97,4346.875,4354.75,"No one is driven to make a profit, no one is driven to hold onto that asset as I mentioned.",80,,
460,0.97,4354.75,4366.895,"We are mission driven to hand the equity stake, the ownership to the community.",80,,
461,0.97,4366.895,4389.418,"The share of the capital is not expected to come from community as the down payment cash, that's not realistic, the goal is for the capital to show up over time and for the cultural space agency to be the long- term partner to allow for that to happen Sustainably.",80,,
462,0.97,4389.418,4393.689,Thank you Matthew.,81,,
463,0.97,4393.689,4396.191,Colleagues.,81,,
464,0.97,4396.191,4400.696,Are there any questions or comments?,81,,
465,0.97,4400.696,4402.731,"Yes, it is Councilmember Juarez.",82,,
466,0.97,4402.731,4405.934,I have two questions.,82,,
467,0.97,4405.934,4420.115,"One that comes to mind immediately is what does this cultural space agency as a PDA, number one would you look at your address existing cultural spaces?",82,,
468,0.97,4420.115,4458.787,"Yeah, I was going to start naming vulnerable spaces, I don't want to put a spotlight on any particular space, there are a series of vulnerable cultural spaces in Seattle that are at home in their current facilities with no ownership in their vulnerable to the market force in those communities, if we can help these facilities acquire more appropriate facilities, you know the warehouse in Soto type of model we would be looking at those models as well.",83,,
469,0.97,4458.787,4470.699,"If you don't mind, I want to make a statement first and then ask a question.",84,,
470,0.97,4470.699,4498.994,"Right now we are in the middle of a lawsuit but we're trying to save the Seattle Archives building and the building as you know is not as old as the blue moon was certainly older than the show box and the other concern that I have about who decides where a cultural space is, take for example daybreak Star . The city owns the property.",84,,
471,0.97,4498.994,4515.644,"It is a cultural space in severe disrepair . houses PDA which can assume and issue that, how is this organization going to help those spaces that need help right now?",84,,
472,0.97,4515.644,4543.272,"When so much, when people were doing save the show box I remember thinking I wish they would come out this fervently when we have other cultural spaces and other things that demand just as much attention that nobody cares about because society has determined what is a cultural space.",84,,
473,0.97,4543.272,4564.993,"They determine what is worth preserving without recognizing as you all know that there were attempts to erase and get rid of anything that represented indigenous presence, Asian or African-American presence, I could go on and on but I won't.",84,,
474,0.97,4564.993,4576.104,There's some hypocrisy in that and that is annoying and as former legal Council on the Indian service Commission which is a PDA like the Pike place market which came out of the community block grants of the 70s.,84,,
475,0.97,4576.104,4600.329,"I am having a hard time seeing how this will address number one, cultural spaces we have now that need it and number two how we are going, how are you going to pay for this, I mean I don't know if you can completely rely when you keep saying the community, how does community built capital?",84,,
476,0.97,4600.329,4608.604,So there is community ownership? we use community all the time and sometimes it becomes a Catchphrase.,84,,
477,0.97,4608.604,4617.746,Maybe I will take those in reverse order.,85,,
478,0.97,4617.746,4624.987,How does community built capital is a giant question and we have been searching for the solution.,85,,
479,0.97,4624.987,4631.026,It is a slow process and I don't know we can make the Processmuch faster.,85,,
480,0.97,4631.026,4648.076,We can acknowledge it is a slow process and takes time and because it takes time you need a long-term intermediary partner to step in to support the organization and community while they take a decade or two decades to raise the capital.,85,,
481,0.97,4648.076,4670.632,"To not be subject to the whims of the market that owns your building in a private scenario that may have a different use for the building, may want to cash out of the building, may need to increase your rent or whatever, to have a mission driven worker, for the ownership that's important.",85,,
482,0.97,4670.632,4679.374,How do we support existing spaces is wrapped up in that as well.,85,,
483,0.97,4679.374,4686.882,Can we stand in and create at least a mission driven partner as Ownerhip entity instead of a market that does not have the community's interest in mind.,85,,
484,0.97,4686.882,4721.817,We already reached out and I agree the movement of those archives is designed while I will not presume that it's going to have an impact of severely limiting the advocacy and the self organizing that indigenous communities are able to do and we have already reached out to leaders including Colleen at the Seattle Club and Mike at United indigenous tribes to see if the cultural space agency could be a partner.,85,,
485,0.97,4721.817,4734.563,Is there a place for the agency to support any of the advocacy there and try to get into the call the other day that was full and hosted to the governor's office.,85,,
486,0.97,4734.563,4756.151,That's very much on the radar and I absolutely agree that their communities that typically do not get to shine in the spotlight a preservation in the way that for example the show box did several years ago when it came out as a hot spot of preservation in this town.,85,,
487,0.97,4756.151,4766.695,"I know I moved backwards through those, not sure if I addressed all the pieces of that but to the central question where does the capital come from?",85,,
488,0.97,4766.695,4768.363,What are we talking about with community capital?,85,,
489,0.97,4768.363,4785.113,"We talked about time honestly, Philanthropy they have to raise, individuals and community they have to organize, different assets that will come in overtime and can we create an entity that will allow communities that time.",85,,
490,0.97,4785.113,4790.218,Thank you.,86,,
491,0.97,4790.218,4797.592,Any other questions colleagues?,87,,
492,0.97,4797.592,4804.332,I am not seeing any hands or anyone come off mute.,87,,
493,0.97,4804.332,4805.901,Okay.,87,,
494,0.97,4805.901,4806.301,Very good.,87,,
495,0.97,4806.301,4808.136,Thank you very much.,87,,
496,0.97,4808.136,4811.339,To all of you.,87,,
497,0.97,4811.339,4818.046,"Anything else, any other comments you want to make?",87,,
498,0.97,4818.046,4825.754,Thank you for the time.,88,,
499,0.97,4825.754,4827.255,Thank you.,89,,
500,0.97,4827.255,4830.826,Madam chair can make a brief comment?,90,,
501,0.97,4830.826,4832.928,I'm sorry.,90,,
502,0.97,4832.928,4835.363,"Yes please, Councilmember Lewis.",91,,
503,0.97,4835.363,4864.392,I want to take a moment to go back to your comments earlier when you are thanking all of us on the Council for our support . I do very fondly remember back when we could have congregate gatherings and talking to you about a year ago and had big plans back then for first Thursday to be part of my monthly routine on the Council.,92,,
504,0.97,4864.392,4867.195,I have fond memories of those hypothetical plans.,92,,
505,0.97,4867.195,4890.785,I want to take a moment to relay back your kind words and say that you will be very much missed by myself and I'm sure by my colleagues as you go on to new challenges and I greatly appreciate your leadership . not only as a Councilmember but as someone who has known you for many years to the Washington bus and a lot of your other civic activities.,92,,
506,0.97,4890.785,4893.288,Greatly appreciate your contribution.,92,,
507,0.97,4893.288,4902.797,"I do appreciate, I think all of us should aspire to age as gracefully in positions of leadership as you have.",92,,
508,0.97,4902.797,4930.258,You don't look a day older than when you took over office and that will not be something I will be able to say for myself so I really appreciate that you have handled such a difficult job with grace and you are leaving the Department in such a great condition and you will be sorely missed and I hope we can take advantage of your leadership in other ways in the city as we move on to new challenges.,92,,
509,0.97,4930.258,4933.862,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",93,,
510,0.97,4933.862,4937.532,I want to echo those comments.,93,,
511,0.97,4937.532,4956.184,"We will Miss you and want to wish you the best in your next move . and joy beacon Hill and look forward to looking forward to working with you Calandra and making sure that this work keeps moving forward, so thank you all of you.",93,,
512,0.97,4956.184,4962.49,Have a fabulous afternoon.,93,,
513,0.97,4962.49,4963.291,Thank you so much.,94,,
514,0.97,4963.291,4966.594,Okay let's move on to item 16.,95,,
515,0.97,4966.594,4969.097,With the clerk please read an M- 16 into the record?,95,,
516,0.97,4969.097,4979.975,Agenda item 16 Council bill 119982.,96,,
517,0.97,4979.975,4984.045,"An ordinance relating to the Seattle Commission for people with disabilities, changing the name to the Seattle disability Commission.",96,,
518,0.97,4984.045,4991.319,Requesting that the code Revisor revised the Seattle municipal code accordingly.,96,,
519,0.97,4991.319,4992.187,"Very good, thank you.",97,,
520,0.97,4992.187,5003.131,I will say I served as a human rights Commissioner several years ago and at that time this conversation was going on.,97,,
521,0.97,5003.131,5006.801,"So, I am excited to hear that the Commission has made a decision, happy to support it.",97,,
522,0.97,5006.801,5014.142,I will pass this on to Helen Gebramlak to present the proposed change.,97,,
523,0.97,5014.142,5017.145,Thank you Councilmember Morales and Councilmembers.,98,,
524,0.97,5017.145,5028.323,"Like you said, the conversation has been going on for quite some time in the full Commission voted unanimously in June to make the change.",98,,
525,0.97,5028.323,5033.028,I will go over briefly a couple of the main reasons for the change.,98,,
526,0.97,5033.028,5036.664,The first and primary one is to broaden Inclusivity.,98,,
527,0.97,5036.664,5048.376,The disability Commission or communities are very diverse culturally and politically just like any other community.,98,,
528,0.97,5048.376,5060.655,"And, within that there are a Plethora of different self identification preferences and really there are main camps I will talk about.",98,,
529,0.97,5060.655,5071.232,"The first is known as person first language which is reflected in the current construction of the name, that is the Commission for people with disabilities.",98,,
530,0.97,5071.232,5087.816,"Other examples are a woman with Schizophrenia, a farmer who is blind, it's really language that aims to center the whole person while acknowledging the disability.",98,,
531,0.97,5087.816,5100.328,There are a lot of folks who prefer person first language but there are also folks who prefer identity first language and that is what it sounds like.,98,,
532,0.97,5100.328,5116.544,"Saying disabled person, autistic accountant, a deaf woman and there are certain cultural differences for that such as the deaf community and artistic community for instance.",98,,
533,0.97,5116.544,5124.619,There is a strong cultural preference for identity first language and there is a host of other reasons one might prefer identity first language.,98,,
534,0.97,5124.619,5153.448,"The Commission decided to move away from either using person first language or identity first language and instead use a construction Seattle disability Commission which clearly States the subject matter of the Commission, the communities that the Commission represents without necessarily excluding any parts of those communities who may have a preference.",98,,
535,0.97,5153.448,5169.297,"Secondly you know, this also puts the Commission name in line with the other community centered city commissions like the Seattle women's Commission, Seattle Lgbtq Commission.",98,,
536,0.97,5169.297,5181.075,So like I said the Commission voted unanimously in June in order to get the name change reflected in the code that requires Council action and that's what this bill does.,98,,
537,0.97,5181.075,5183.278,Happy to answer any questions.,98,,
538,0.97,5183.278,5186.147,Thank you for explaining that.,99,,
539,0.97,5186.147,5202.33,I have held that attention myself trying to understand which of those person first disability first is appropriate and it sounds like it depends on who you are talking to.,99,,
540,0.97,5202.33,5206.501,So I'm glad the Commission has reached consent.,99,,
541,0.97,5206.501,5213.308,I will ask if colleagues have any questions for Helen . Okay.,99,,
542,0.97,5213.308,5218.446,Very good.,99,,
543,0.97,5218.446,5219.247,Thank you so much Helen.,99,,
544,0.97,5219.247,5223.518,Council members I move that the committee recommend passage of Council bill 11 9982.,99,,

550,0.97,5237.966,5248.276,[roll call],102,,
551,0.97,5251.346,5254.983,Thank you.,103,,

553,0.97,5262.69,5266.361,Colleagues any of the questions or good of the order?,103,,
554,0.97,5266.361,5278.373,No? all right in that case this concludes the January 22nd 2021 special meeting of the community economic development committee.,103,,
555,0.97,5278.373,5280.375,Thank you for attending everybody.,103,,
