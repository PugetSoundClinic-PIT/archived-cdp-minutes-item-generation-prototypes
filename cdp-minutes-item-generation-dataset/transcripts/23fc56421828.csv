144,0.7829006314277649,871.4,873.4,I'm not going to read everything on this slide.,,,
145,0.7829006314277649,873.4,880.7,"I'm just going to summarize where we're at, but most people are not interested in continuing to invest in policing, and she's systems up harmless.",,,
146,0.7829006314277649,880.7,884.2,Instead we are interested in learning how to keep each other safe.,,,
147,0.7829006314277649,884.2,892.0,"Without police coercion, and it brought a systemic violence and I say we're interested in learning how to do this while also recognizing that in many communities.",,,
148,0.7829006314277649,892.0,898.2,They are already doing this and they're just not funded and supported at a level where we can really scale yet.,,,
149,0.889788806438446,898.4,912.4, But that is changing and so what we're seeing is a need to invest in lived experience and need to address root causes because we need to stop punishing individuals for systems failures and then finally to fully Embrace a new normal.,,,
150,0.889788806438446,912.4,919.6,"I really appreciate the early remarks that were made before this presentation, about the need to really follow black leadership here.",,,
151,0.889788806438446,919.8,926.0,"One of the most consistent findings, you said need to listen, follow and normalize leadership from those closest to the issues.",,,

153,0.8679097294807434,928.3,932.6," Charity across those depressions, that typically, you know, push this apart from each other.",,,
154,0.8679097294807434,932.8,940.3,"So those include things like anti-black racism, transphobia, ableism ageism sexism Etc.",,,
155,0.8679097294807434,940.6,945.1,"But it's really about really fully embracing, the idea that things are just going to be done differently.",,,
156,0.8679097294807434,945.1,958.2,"Now, now here we have who we've heard from the numbers have actually increased since then, but I'll go ahead and present these which is across teams we've heard from well over 2,000 community members, we've heard from over.",,,
157,0.7794494032859802,958.4,963.2," You thousand community members, just from our main survey, the community needs assessment survey.",,,
158,0.7794494032859802,963.4,978.4,"And then as several of our teams will present, they've also heard from some so many people as you all may be aware over, half of Seattle's population, is under 45 and in our Sample about sixty percent are under 45 in terms of race.",,,
159,0.7794494032859802,978.4,987.7,"We've heard from people across all groups ethnicity as well, two-thirds or by POC that is black and brown community members including people of mixed Heritage has",,,

161,0.7417595386505127,999.6,1004.5,"And we also have multilingual, focus groups, interviews and conversations.",,,

163,0.7417595386505127,1008.0,1013.3,This is another slide we can dig in deeper for the Q&A but it's a lot of what you've heard so far.,,,
164,0.7417595386505127,1013.6,1015.6,"One, you know, stop causing harm.",,,
165,0.7417595386505127,1015.6,1018.2,So we want there to be a real Reckoning with the,,,
166,0.8303143978118896,1018.4,1020.7, That's some of the systems you have in place hurt us.,,,
167,0.8303143978118896,1020.7,1035.3,Let's stop doing that to create inclusive policies and for that it's really about prioritizing that lived experience and really thinking about what needs to happen differently to allow that to come to the front third.,,,
168,0.8303143978118896,1035.3,1040.0,Its fellow black leadership that goes without saying but it's really there are different solutions that come from.,,,
169,0.8303143978118896,1040.0,1048.2,Those closest to the issues forth is pay for a community expertise so that includes funding Community priorities and it also,,,
170,0.7793606519699097,1048.3,1060.3," So, includes doing things like this, where you are intentionally creating the opportunity for Community to lead with its expertise and providing a support role and finally investing in brightening Solutions.",,,
171,0.7793606519699097,1060.3,1067.5,"And so when things work, we invest in that a big piece of This research was about figuring out.",,,
172,0.7793606519699097,1067.5,1072.3,"What should participatory budgeting look like, you know, what is a roadmap look like?",,,
173,0.7793606519699097,1072.3,1074.0,That's really rooted in equity.,,,
174,0.7793606519699097,1074.6,1078.2,The most important thing that I want to highlight for you is just going to,,,
175,0.820357620716095,1078.3,1083.2, Talking about the steering committee because the steering committee is the group that's going to be setting.,,,
176,0.820357620716095,1083.2,1090.9,A lot of the rules of what PB looks like and it's also one of many different bodies that will be informing this work.,,,
177,0.820357620716095,1091.6,1094.4,You can see on the left side we have that.,,,
178,0.820357620716095,1094.4,1103.1,The idea here is that the black Brilliance research priorities and the stuff that we're the things that we are researching and forms with the steering committee is going to look like.,,,
179,0.820357620716095,1103.1,1108.2,So we have priorities these are created shared and vetted with weekly teacher.,,,
180,0.8683377504348755,1108.3,1115.5," Jen's, we have Community conversations, we have several different ways for people to be involved, including taking our main survey.",,,
181,0.8683377504348755,1116.4,1119.4,We're also developing out steering committee priorities.,,,
182,0.8683377504348755,1119.4,1123.5,As part of this research and defining and really articulating.,,,
183,0.8683377504348755,1123.5,1125.2,What accountability can look like,,,
184,0.8892787098884583,1126.4,1136.8," Sometime likely in January, it's going to be the part where we start kicking off the city that is starts kicking off the process of like selecting the steering committee.",,,
185,0.8892787098884583,1137.1,1140.2,The idea here is that using the black Brilliance research priorities.,,,
186,0.8892787098884583,1140.2,1152.7,Using the steering committee priorities that we identify and the accountability structure that we identify will allow us to be able to post criteria for people to apply for the steering committee.,,,
187,0.8892787098884583,1152.7,1155.5,And then from there the steering committee can start,,,
188,0.8008646368980408,1157.6,1160.9, This slide is just here to remind you all with the overall PB process.,,,
189,0.8008646368980408,1160.9,1167.4,"Looks like, where the steering committee is kind of throughout, but like we got design and like giving ideas and voting etcetera.",,,
190,0.8008646368980408,1167.7,1171.6,This slide is here just in case there's questions about the PV process.,,,
191,0.8008646368980408,1172.5,1174.5,So steering committee experiences.,,,
192,0.8008646368980408,1174.5,1187.2,"Here are the experiences so far that we know have strong consensus across the community, for what what people want to see reflected on that steering committee, one is people with lived experience with every single",,,
193,0.9128391742706299,1187.4,1188.9, Age of the criminal legal system.,,,
194,0.9128391742706299,1188.9,1201.7,"So people who are formerly incarcerated again because those closest to the issues are closest to the solution, we want to make sure as we're building out a new model of really addressing what creates true can you safety health and thriving?",,,
195,0.9128391742706299,1201.9,1204.1,That people who are formerly incarcerated?,,,
196,0.9128391742706299,1204.2,1217.2,Some of them are on that steering committee as well as black people with ties to Seattle people who have that institutional knowledge about the way that PB has happened before for their communities and what some of those shortcomings are as,,,
197,0.8379502296447754,1217.3,1226.0," Well, as commitments that have been made to community, and that you have or haven't come to play that historical, institutional knowledge is crucial.",,,
198,0.8379502296447754,1226.0,1235.0,"And so having people from Seattle, especially black people from Seattle's really important there at least two youth, as well as people from the African diaspora.",,,
199,0.8379502296447754,1235.1,1246.7,"Are also strong consensus from community in terms of sitting on the steering committee, there are a couple of other experiences that will likely appear and the December 21st preliminary report.",,,
200,0.8379502296447754,1246.7,1247.3,But we're still,,,
201,0.8755074143409729,1247.4,1256.5," Trying to analyze to make sure that we are that we are clear that there's the strong consensus like these before, we put them forward.",,,
202,0.8032335042953491,1257.6,1264.7," But the most important thing, perhaps for a lot of community members is talking about what I accountability looks like.",,,
203,0.8032335042953491,1264.8,1277.4,"So this summer, you may remember, there's a big one of the big things that was happening, was we 1pb it's like, yes we want it and this research is going to inform it, which is happening.",,,
204,0.8032335042953491,1277.8,1287.2,"And then almost immediately, the mayor announced a task force, that would somehow be able to you know think about what sort of Investments",,,
205,0.9014027118682861,1287.4,1296.8," Um, decoupled from divestments Community might want and a lot of the initial concerns around the community is about transparency.",,,
206,0.9014027118682861,1296.8,1299.4,And also that what an accountability model looks like.,,,
207,0.9014027118682861,1299.4,1306.5,"When you have these sort of two different groups that are working on, what seemed to be the same thing, but not quite.",,,
208,0.9014027118682861,1306.5,1309.0,And so accountability has been a Common Thread.,,,
209,0.9014027118682861,1309.0,1317.2,"But this is a story that existed long before this year, where anytime you have task force and work groups and, you know, interdepartmental",,,
210,0.8550543189048767,1317.3,1317.8, Teams.,,,
211,0.8550543189048767,1317.8,1321.5,"And, like, all of these different organizing bodies representing Community.",,,
212,0.8550543189048767,1321.7,1332.9,"How do you decide how they're accountable and the left side, here are some things that we're hearing is really important for the steering committee and other bodies to have with each other.",,,
213,0.8550543189048767,1332.9,1342.4,"So things like mutual respect, and Trust in Partnership and engaging in ongoing work to create inclusive and positive relationships with each other, those are important.",,,
214,0.8550543189048767,1342.4,1347.1,"And any kind of organizing body here, I'm naming them explicitly for the steering committee.",,,
215,0.8190078735351562,1347.4,1350.0, And on the right-hand side we have accountability to the public.,,,
216,0.8190078735351562,1350.0,1351.8,So what are people really looking for?,,,
217,0.8190078735351562,1352.0,1352.4,Things?,,,
218,0.8190078735351562,1352.4,1354.9,Like weekly reports that are accessible.,,,
219,0.8190078735351562,1355.6,1377.2,"So what that might look like is hosting a weekly Zoom calls or having podcast or media tours or just there's a variety of different ways, but really being transparent on a weekly basis and also having things like office hours where people can pop in and ask their question and get like an actual person who will be able to talk.",,,
220,0.7781352996826172,1377.3,1381.6, Talk to them and describe their decision making process as well as answer questions.,,,
221,0.7781352996826172,1382.7,1400.6,"One thing that's really important to note is that people want to be able to have relationships with those who are representing them and they want to make sure that if the committee is acting in ways that are not aligned with what they want, as community members that the committee will respond with compassion and in a timely fashion.",,,
222,0.7781352996826172,1400.6,1407.2,"So a big part of our research especially in December, has been refining this out and providing more details in our",,,
223,0.8843286037445068,1407.3,1407.7, For it.,,,
224,0.8843286037445068,1407.7,1416.9,"And then this is essentially the last big slide and then I'll start handing this over to our team, which is about priorities for the city's role.",,,
225,0.8843286037445068,1416.9,1418.4,So this is a partnership.,,,
226,0.8843286037445068,1418.4,1428.6,"Participatory budgeting is going to be a partnership between, you know, community and City and partners who know more about best practices for participatory budgeting.",,,
227,0.8843286037445068,1428.6,1434.9,"And the city's role is to fold one to follow Community leadership, this is really important.",,,

230,0.8737475275993347,1439.2,1440.3,That's a big theme.,,,
231,0.8737475275993347,1440.5,1455.3,"And what we really want to see is that Community should extend the invitation to departments before they start the work and that, that, that the city departments really take the lead from community members with a focus on Community Development.",,,
232,0.8737475275993347,1455.6,1459.6,We want to see departments that have track records working with tens of millions of dollars.,,,
233,0.8737475275993347,1459.9,1467.2,And we also want to see departments that are successful at knowing how to get dollars out the door and ways that are responsive to community.,,,
234,0.7648886442184448,1467.4,1477.3," Needs what this means in terms of different kinds of roles that instead of strategic advisors, who sort of tell, you know, Community, this is how it's going to go.",,,
235,0.7648886442184448,1477.6,1482.9,We're looking for people who are more like a grant maker like financial support kind of role.,,,

239,0.7878353595733643,1498.5,1509.2,"So we're looking at, you know, how do you map out Investments and how those have flowed over time in different neighborhoods and there aren't that many departments that have access to that kind of data.",,,
240,0.7878353595733643,1510.3,1525.1,"And we're also looking for liaison, so we're looking for this work to be held by a few different departments, but led by one specifically, we see strong support for the EDI division with that within the office of planning, Community Development.",,,

397,0.8576275706291199,2381.8,2386.7,I'm sure my colleagues have a lot of questions so I just want to focus on two things.,,,
398,0.8576275706291199,2387.2,2401.4,One is the role of the city which as I'm hearing the conversation really is not about direct Community engagement or or even directing the program design itself.,,,

403,0.9128382205963135,2419.2,2431.2,"And then the second question is about who the right department is, we have done, participatory budgeting a couple of times in the city.",,,

407,0.8646566271781921,2445.1,2457.0,It sounds like there are some particular questions or things that you would like to explore in terms of doing a different department or maybe a different constellation of department.,,,
408,0.8646566271781921,2457.0,2459.3,So I'm wondering if you can talk about that a little bit as well.,,,
409,0.8646566271781921,2459.6,2466.1,"Sure, one of the participatory budgeting process is a team effort with the city.",,,
410,0.7153670787811279,2466.2,2467.1, Even support role.,,,
411,0.7153670787811279,2467.1,2488.6,"Yes, in terms of the financial management contracting compliance aspects but also at the very beginning, there will be a steering committee and there will be different work groups that are supporting this work different committees and there are opportunities for people who are embedded in City departments to participate in that work as well.",,,
412,0.7153670787811279,2488.8,2496.1,"Which means that no, it's not waiting until the ideas are being collected but actually early early on in the design phase of",,,
413,0.8720384240150452,2496.2,2503.1, Be there will be roles for people who are embedded in the city as well as different areas of community to be participating.,,,
414,0.8720384240150452,2503.3,2510.2,"So things like an accountability, you know, committee that will be in charge of making sure that monitoring and finding out.",,,
415,0.8720384240150452,2510.2,2515.7,"If there's any concerns about the process surfacing, those concerns to the relevant parties.",,,
416,0.8720384240150452,2515.7,2518.7,"So they'll be, you know, committees like that.",,,
417,0.8720384240150452,2518.7,2525.0,"There's a lot more details will go into the report, but basically there's a roll earlier on, and then just in the design phase,",,,
418,0.7632563710212708,2526.2,2534.1," Second pieces, there is a strong consensus with people who are familiar with the participatory budgeting process in Seattle, that the department of neighborhood.",,,
419,0.7632563710212708,2534.1,2539.1,Should not be the main holder of this work and I'm not usually so direct.,,,
420,0.7632563710212708,2539.1,2541.5,But the feedback is very direct.,,,
421,0.7632563710212708,2541.6,2553.3,And that what we're looking for is a world where we are looking at the data seeing that there is significant disparities and the previous iterations of PB and learning from that.,,,
422,0.7632563710212708,2553.3,2556.0,"So that when we designed this new PB process, we",,,
423,0.8223402500152588,2556.1,2565.5," For that, there's no reason why my goodness, there's no reason why a particular Department who has done something a couple times.",,,
424,0.8223402500152588,2565.9,2569.1,Should always be the holder of that work.,,,
425,0.8223402500152588,2570.2,2576.1,There's the opportunity for Community to reflect reassess and then make a new recommendation.,,,
426,0.8223402500152588,2576.3,2580.4,The new recommendation is not Department of neighborhoods Department of neighborhoods.,,,
427,0.8223402500152588,2580.4,2582.3,Could participate in this again.,,,
428,0.8223402500152588,2582.3,2585.5,"There's many different committees, but they should not be the main holder.",,,
429,0.8919031023979187,2586.2,2597.8," We're looking at the EDI out of the office of planning and Community Development to hold that work for their long-term vision for their long-term success and Trust in the community, really focusing on Equitable development.",,,
430,0.8919031023979187,2598.1,2607.4,That is a win for us and a department that did not just go in thinking that they were the presumed holder of this work is also important.,,,
431,0.8919031023979187,2607.5,2616.0,It is thus it is really common for certain departments in the city to assume that said that the community has given them permission without asking.,,,
432,0.8416014313697815,2616.1,2616.7, For it.,,,
433,0.8416014313697815,2616.8,2620.2,And so many people were adamant that that is absolutely the wrong call.,,,
434,0.8416014313697815,2620.3,2623.0,So to be clear that's the direction.,,,
435,0.7748913764953613,2628.3,2630.4," Any follow-up questions, councilmember what?",,,
436,0.7748913764953613,2630.4,2636.0,"Alice, okay colleagues any other questions?",,,
437,0.7748913764953613,2636.0,2639.5,"Because we're Mesquita and then councilmember Wars, thank you.",,,
438,0.7748913764953613,2640.5,2642.5,Thank you all very much for this presentation.,,,
439,0.7748913764953613,2643.0,2645.2,I also want to thank you for your earlier report.,,,
440,0.7748913764953613,2645.2,2653.7,I think it was a 15 or 16 page initial report that you published a few weeks ago and right towards the end of our budget.,,,
441,0.7748913764953613,2653.7,2655.1,So I want to thank you for that.,,,
442,0.7748913764953613,2655.5,2657.8,"Part of my questions, our team has been, how do we",,,
443,0.8061792254447937,2658.0,2666.6," You literally get updates about all the good work you're doing, just knowing how fast things are moving and, you know, respective to how slow things that moved in the past.",,,
444,0.8061792254447937,2667.3,2670.1,It is really helpful to be able to hear today.,,,
445,0.8061792254447937,2670.6,2671.8,All of the work you're doing.,,,
446,0.8061792254447937,2671.8,2677.1,"And I think, every time I hear about it, I understand more and more of the breadth of the type of work that you're doing.",,,
447,0.8061792254447937,2677.1,2678.2,"So, thank you for that.",,,
448,0.8061792254447937,2678.5,2683.5,"I know councilmember her bold if she were here, would probably be able to answer this as well, but can you remind us?",,,
449,0.8061792254447937,2683.5,2687.8,"Are there any planned reports back to Public, Safety, or",,,
450,0.8432667851448059,2687.9,2695.2, Or to the council as a whole that we can anticipate or that the public can anticipate as we learn more about how these systems are getting set up.,,,
451,0.8432667851448059,2695.2,2707.1,And then any initial results that you continue to deceive in advance of your full report that will be forthcoming is that is that already baked into the report back system and if so could you tell us more about when we can expect those?,,,
452,0.8432667851448059,2707.3,2707.8,Yes.,,,
453,0.8432667851448059,2707.9,2717.8,"And so every Monday, we have community tietjens and sometimes they're also press conferences from 3:30 to 4:30 those are streamed on Facebook and YouTube in Paris.",,,
454,0.8938903212547302,2717.9,2719.3, Open Twitter and all of those things.,,,
455,0.8938903212547302,2719.3,2722.8,"So, that's one way community has been involved.",,,
456,0.8938903212547302,2722.8,2732.5,"We also have office hours twice a week where we present and asked allow people at answer and questions we meet with councilmember, Morales is office once a week.",,,
457,0.8938903212547302,2732.5,2747.1,"Now on the research to say how it's going and my understanding is councilman Morales will then be presenting out to the rest of counsel and then basically what I think January is going to look like I know December, there's a recess",,,
458,0.8865454196929932,2747.9,2751.6," We will kick up and we'll be doing a lot more, report-outs events, Etc.",,,
459,0.8865454196929932,2751.6,2757.3,We have our December twenty first preliminary report which will be more detailed than this.,,,
460,0.8865454196929932,2757.3,2769.7,"Also, apologies to my other teams who did not present today, but we will share out these slides and they do have video and content including details about all many of the other projects involved.",,,
461,0.8865454196929932,2769.7,2777.7,"So, I would say that if you're interested in being involved, it's actually really hard, not to, because there's multiple touch points during the week, where you can,",,,
462,0.8360740542411804,2777.9,2781.1, Come in and ask questions or listen to how things are going.,,,
463,0.8360740542411804,2781.7,2786.9,And that will continue to be the case through the end of our contract and four teams who will be doing.,,,
464,0.8360740542411804,2786.9,2790.1,This work Beyond will also be regular updates.,,,
465,0.8360740542411804,2790.1,2798.4,We're trying to demonstrate what accountability might look like and a process with many key players and I think that it's an all hands on deck.,,,
466,0.8360740542411804,2798.4,2804.9,"All Communications Channel, talk to your neighbors, talk to your elders, talk to your community type situation.",,,
467,0.8360740542411804,2805.8,2806.7,That's a president.,,,
468,0.7358145117759705,2807.8,2813.6," If I can follow up on that for just a second, you're muted.",,,
469,0.7358145117759705,2813.6,2815.0,But I think you said sure.,,,
470,0.7358145117759705,2817.0,2819.9,So sorry you think I would have figured this out by now?,,,
471,0.7358145117759705,2820.5,2823.9,"I was saying, yes, but I know that Kim's murder was get.",,,
472,0.7358145117759705,2823.9,2825.0,It has a follow-up question.,,,
473,0.7358145117759705,2825.0,2827.4,"So yeah, I just wants is related to that.",,,
474,0.7358145117759705,2827.4,2828.1,That's great.,,,
475,0.7358145117759705,2828.3,2837.0,"I just want to say that the contract does ask that the final report be presented in my committee, and at the end of the first quarter, so that will be sort.",,,

477,0.7521253824234009,2840.2,2844.0,"But as Sean said, throughout this process we will be updating folks as well.",,,
478,0.9018114805221558,2846.1,2848.1, Thank you Council council president.,,,
479,0.9018114805221558,2848.6,2849.7,Thank you so much.,,,
480,0.9018114805221558,2849.7,2855.3,I also recognize that as we think about this paradigm shift to investing in community.,,,
481,0.9018114805221558,2855.3,2857.4,That is a good reminder.,,,
482,0.9018114805221558,2857.4,2861.2,That the report backs are not in public safety and it is an equitable development.,,,
483,0.9018114805221558,2861.2,2873.3,"Thank you, councilman Morales and I look forward to getting updates from you and if there is the opportunity to sit in on your committee and hear any of the updates, in addition to the public forms that are being provided, that would be great.",,,
484,0.9018114805221558,2873.3,2875.8,"And yeah, this is a good",,,
485,0.7404142618179321,2876.0,2882.0," Minor that we often think of this as you know, Public Safety, what's the traditional Public Safety model that is exact precisely?",,,
486,0.7404142618179321,2882.0,2899.7,"Why this report comes back to Equitable development because it's investing early to ever prevent or two earlier invest in community and in families, to make sure that there are fewer incidences of people having to interact with police and criminal justice system.",,,
487,0.7404142618179321,2899.7,2900.7,"So, thank you for that, reminder.",,,
488,0.7404142618179321,2900.7,2903.0,And I look forward to additional report backs them.,,,
489,0.7404142618179321,2903.0,2905.8,Thanks so much for the presentation today and I look forward to reading through the,,,
490,0.7355825304985046,2905.9,2908.1," the rest of the slides, thank you.",,,
491,0.7355825304985046,2908.1,2919.5,"And I also forgot to mention, we do written reports as well weekly and so we do that to our community but we'll also be sending y'all weekly report outs as well, because I know that not all of you can a teacher can attend our teaching.",,,
492,0.7355825304985046,2919.5,2921.4,So that's also available to you.,,,
493,0.7355825304985046,2922.1,2922.4,Yeah.,,,
494,0.7355825304985046,2922.4,2927.0,"And I think that teachers are currently proposed occur on Monday, afternoons.",,,
495,0.7355825304985046,2927.0,2929.3,At the same time that were in full Council meetings.,,,
496,0.7355825304985046,2929.3,2935.7,"Which pretty much means we'll never be able to attend them, unfortunately, because of the ongoing conflict but",,,
497,0.8775840997695923,2936.3,2938.3, Getting access to those weekly reports.,,,
498,0.8775840997695923,2939.2,2941.7,Consistently regularly will be really important.,,,
499,0.8775840997695923,2941.7,2946.1,We don't want to create too much bureaucracy in terms of how you can get it to us.,,,
500,0.8775840997695923,2946.1,2951.7,So I would just propose that that perhaps comes from what Alice is the chair responsible for overseeing.,,,
501,0.8775840997695923,2951.7,2959.4,"This work your office, be the point and then your office out of the responsibility of Distributing that information to the full Council.",,,
502,0.802283525466919,2960.8,2962.3," Okay, Council marijuana is.",,,
503,0.802283525466919,2962.3,2964.8,I know you are in the queue and colleagues.,,,
504,0.802283525466919,2964.8,2968.7,"If anyone else is interested, I see council member Petersen.",,,
505,0.802283525466919,2969.1,2970.0,Not so customer.,,,
506,0.802283525466919,2970.0,2971.5,Where is and then customer Peterson.,,,
507,0.802283525466919,2971.9,2973.7,Good morning Q. Thank you.,,,
508,0.802283525466919,2974.3,2975.3,Let me turn this up here.,,,
509,0.802283525466919,2975.6,2977.7,"First of all, thank you so much for the presentation.",,,
510,0.802283525466919,2978.1,2980.3,I've probably sit in on some of these teachings.,,,
511,0.802283525466919,2980.3,2983.9,"There's a bunch of questions I want to ask, but I don't want to take up all this time this morning.",,,
512,0.802283525466919,2984.2,2986.0,So I do have three questions.,,,
513,0.802283525466919,2986.7,2990.4,"Some of them are just pretty Technical and straightforward, but before I begin, I want to",,,
514,0.8924049139022827,2990.6,3007.0, With the observation that the analogies in the approach that black Brilliance is taking towards self-determination and empowerment and change and policy and how you sustain that so much mirrors Indian Country which is second nature to me.,,,
515,0.8924049139022827,3007.0,3008.2,So thank you for that.,,,
516,0.8924049139022827,3008.7,3011.8,It's interesting to watch hopefully we can be a part of that.,,,
517,0.8924049139022827,3012.1,3018.2,I know we have a partnership as City electives but I guess my issue for my questions.,,,
518,0.8924049139022827,3018.3,3020.3,"First of all, our for Sean",,,
519,0.9031627178192139,3020.5,3022.3, And so Sean one thing.,,,
520,0.9031627178192139,3022.6,3028.1,"So the preliminary report will get, you said that would be more detailed on, December 21st.",,,
521,0.9031627178192139,3028.4,3031.5,So can we submit questions to you ahead of that?,,,
522,0.9031627178192139,3031.5,3032.4,Like what we would like?,,,
523,0.9031627178192139,3032.4,3037.2,"But I'm concerned about the sustainability, but I'll get to that question in a minute.",,,
524,0.9031627178192139,3037.3,3046.9,"So we could send that to you directly from the PowerPoint, what kind of questions and maybe some guidance for some of us who are you know, entering Elder territory.",,,
525,0.9031627178192139,3046.9,3050.4,"So it kind of have done some of this stuff before you know, how to take brick and",,,
526,0.829072117805481,3050.6,3059.2," Order how to build something, how to hire people, how to have a revenue stream that is sustaining self-sustaining for for generations to come.",,,
527,0.829072117805481,3059.4,3061.7,I'm hoping that I can I can share some of that wisdom.,,,
528,0.829072117805481,3061.7,3063.7,I have a little bit experience in that area.,,,
529,0.829072117805481,3064.0,3064.5,Sure.,,,
530,0.829072117805481,3064.9,3065.3,Great.,,,
531,0.829072117805481,3065.3,3072.3,"And that goes to everyone who's viewing this, if you have feedback that you want to see reflected in that report, please send it to research.",,,
532,0.829072117805481,3072.3,3075.8,"I can County, Equity, now.com, open invitation to all y'all.",,,
533,0.829072117805481,3076.2,3079.1,"Yeah, I think this is a really wonderful opportunity.",,,
534,0.829072117805481,3079.1,3080.4,I've been sharing a lot of what,,,
535,0.7587386965751648,3080.5,3083.6, has been going on with Indian country and tribal governments.,,,
536,0.7587386965751648,3083.8,3095.2,"And I've had other discussions offline, with some black life matters, folks, and Leadership and other African-American communities about the real core for me is self, determination, that that's what's going on here.",,,
537,0.7587386965751648,3095.5,3104.7,"And obviously the African-American black community is different than tribes, because tribes are governments, and there's a whole political relationship, but the issues are the same.",,,
538,0.7587386965751648,3104.7,3110.4,"You're concerned about safety community mental, health, education, housing,",,,
539,0.9120030403137207,3110.6,3119.0," Social Services, you name it and at some point you need to take that power back and say talk to us we know how to fix it and we'll show you how we can do.",,,
540,0.9120030403137207,3119.0,3122.7,"It may not be the way you all do it, but we actually have a way to do it.",,,
541,0.9120030403137207,3123.4,3125.1,So I had a question for LaTonya.,,,
542,0.9120030403137207,3125.3,3136.0,"The Tony, I was really interested to hear that your organization on the want to know a little bit more about the Moore family engagement.",,,

585,0.9027043581008911,3351.9,3357.3,"So for some people, the specifics is about, like we need to be cutting harmful systems.",,,

938,0.8186267018318176,5646.6,5657.6,"22 really water down the eviction moratorium by putting in means testing and we know that would be a devastating blow and absolutely devastating blow, for the renters who need it.",,,
939,0.8186267018318176,5657.6,5663.3,And so that's why we need to make sure that the eviction moratoriums are renewed as is are strengthened,,,
940,0.900572657585144,5663.5,5668.7, Not water down and one final issue I have an amendment to the item.,,,
941,0.900572657585144,5668.7,5676.0,"On today's city council agenda regarding the update to the Seattle, ethics and elections commission's, lobbying rules.",,,
942,0.900572657585144,5676.0,5678.3,And this amendment has also been sent.,,,
943,0.900572657585144,5678.3,5679.8,I believe to all council members.,,,
944,0.900572657585144,5679.8,5684.7,The update makes three changes to the rules to I support.,,,
945,0.900572657585144,5684.7,5691.6,"But the third regulates what the law calls quote, I mean, in quotes, I mean, this is what written in the law, Grassroots lobbying.",,,
946,0.8243614435195923,5692.8,5694.2, I don't consider that lobbying.,,,
947,0.8243614435195923,5694.2,5695.6,"I mean, this is not professional.",,,
948,0.8243614435195923,5695.6,5698.2,"Lobbyists, play paid to talk to elected officials.",,,
949,0.8243614435195923,5698.2,5702.7,This is Grassroots campaigns that organized communities to make their voices heard.,,,
950,0.8243614435195923,5703.1,5712.2,"The rule requires that any Grassroots campaign, that spends at least $750 in a month would have to disclose its expenditures donors and Ames.",,,
951,0.8243614435195923,5713.0,5719.2,I am extremely concerned that this will create a truly chilling effect on genuine Grassroots organizing.,,,
952,0.8243614435195923,5719.3,5722.4,It will be easy for AstroTurf organizations and corporations.,,,
953,0.8884958624839783,5722.6,5727.1, Advertising campaign to make these disclosures but for genuine Grassroots movements.,,,
954,0.8884958624839783,5727.7,5732.2,That may not have a professional accountant and Treasurer which most of them will not.,,,
955,0.8884958624839783,5732.2,5735.0,This paperwork will become frankly impossible.,,,
956,0.8884958624839783,5735.3,5739.3,Imagine if this legislation was on the books during the justice for George Floyd protests.,,,
957,0.8884958624839783,5739.6,5746.9,"During those protests hundreds, or even thousands of people donated to many Community organizations organizing marches, and making demands like",,,
958,0.9040901064872742,5747.8,5758.7," for the city council to defund the police renting, the sound system for a single rally can cost more than 750 dollars, depending on the size of the protest, this puts the protest organizers in an impossible position.",,,
959,0.9040901064872742,5759.3,5777.5,It is technically possible to track down the donor information of everyone who donates over $25 at the protest but it requires a major focus of the organizers who are generally hard-working volunteers and who should be spending their energies on the rally And discussing with people and energizing.,,,
960,0.9128386378288269,5777.6,5783.7," People themselves not tracking technical information, just to comply with cumbersome law.",,,
961,0.9128386378288269,5784.1,5787.5,"Of course, it is, not the intention of the SEC to penalize.",,,
962,0.9128386378288269,5787.5,5798.5,"Genuine volunteer organizers, who are unable to collect all the information required, but the enforcement of these regulations would largely be complaint based just like other SEC regulations.",,,
963,0.9128386378288269,5798.9,5807.4,"And I would guarantee that there are plenty of trump supporters around the country and the right wing in general, who would be ideologically motivated to file complaints.",,,
964,0.908506453037262,5807.5,5809.9, Planes against the black lives matter movement in Seattle.,,,
965,0.908506453037262,5809.9,5817.2,But that's just an example that very likely we would see other Progressive Grassroots organizations also facing that problem.,,,
966,0.908506453037262,5817.6,5825.2,My office has discussed this legislation with Wayne Barnett executive director of the SEC in detail and I really appreciate his time.,,,
967,0.908506453037262,5825.5,5826.4,Walking my staff.,,,
968,0.908506453037262,5826.4,5827.0,Through this.,,,
969,0.908506453037262,5827.4,5833.8,"The reality is however, that there are several questions that have no answer yet that are really fundamental to the impact.",,,

971,0.8969582915306091,5837.6,5839.3, There's a protest on an issue.,,,
972,0.8969582915306091,5839.3,5842.3,At what point does it meet the definition of Grassroots lobbying?,,,
973,0.8969582915306091,5842.3,5851.2,"If it is all about a specific bill that could be straightforward but what if it's about an issue like, defund, the police, what about black lives matter generally?",,,
974,0.8969582915306091,5851.2,5860.2,"For example, unlike election campaigns, which have a very clear start when campaign staff can be trained by the SEC movements grow organically.",,,
975,0.8969582915306091,5860.2,5867.1,There is no clear start moment for campaigns to have to be trained by the SEC so it's not clear to us how will volunteer?,,,
976,0.8548153638839722,5867.7,5869.8, To be made aware of their responsibilities.,,,
977,0.8548153638839722,5870.1,5876.8,"How should volunteers track donations tone in the buckets protest, which is a common strategy for Grassroots, fundraising.",,,
978,0.8548153638839722,5877.4,5886.1,There are no answers to any of these questions yet given that this legislation will at best be ignored.,,,
979,0.8548153638839722,5886.5,5893.3,And at worst will be creating a chilling effect on community organizing by burying them in red tape.,,,
980,0.8548153638839722,5893.6,5897.2,I understand that the concept for these rules is more around,,,
981,0.8479382991790771,5897.6,5901.4, but advertising campaigns and that's very clear and we appreciate mr.,,,
982,0.8479382991790771,5901.4,5902.9,Barnett talking to us about that.,,,
983,0.8479382991790771,5903.2,5906.6,"Like on the server soda industry runs ads against Sweden, beverage tax.",,,
984,0.8479382991790771,5906.9,5910.8,But the sad reality is that this disclosure will be easy for those corporations.,,,
985,0.8479382991790771,5910.8,5917.7,They already have the accountants and lawyers to make it trivial to complete the paperwork and the burden will fall on the volunteer organizers.,,,
986,0.8479382991790771,5918.5,5927.2,"Finally, I also understand that this language has been taken almost word-for-word from the state laws, regulating Grassroots campaigns targeting the state government.",,,
987,0.8479382991790771,5927.4,5927.5,"However,",,,
988,0.7889032959938049,5927.7,5930.6, Were the state regulations of the last place?,,,
989,0.7889032959938049,5930.6,5937.9,I would look for advice on how to create a welcoming environment for Grassroots organizing Olympia is notoriously inaccessible.,,,
990,0.7889032959938049,5938.1,5946.5,"Not necessarily because of this particular rule, but I think the disregard this law has for Grassroots organizing is emblematic of the overall problem.",,,
991,0.7889032959938049,5947.0,5951.0,"The amendment, my office has prepared and thank you, rush Watson for getting it ready.",,,
992,0.7889032959938049,5951.0,5957.5,So rapidly would cut from the build the entire section on Grassroots campaigns and would leave the other two issues taken up the,,,
993,0.881634533405304,5957.6,5969.9," By the bill unchanged, my office initially looked into raising the threshold for the amount of money that would need to be spent to trigger these requirements and in other Council officers would like to explore that further.",,,
994,0.881634533405304,5969.9,5971.4,I'm happy to do that.,,,
995,0.881634533405304,5971.4,5981.2,My staff are happy to do that however in discussing with Wayne Mr. Barnett it became clear that if we raise the threshold high enough to avoid catching genuine Grassroots campaigns.,,,
996,0.881634533405304,5981.5,5986.2,It will also be high enough for most corporate advertising campaigns to also fly under the radar.,,,
997,0.881634533405304,5986.5,5987.5,And if it was in their interest,,,
998,0.7842106223106384,5987.7,5992.8," So they could always plant identical, small entities into intentional to intentionally fly under the radar.",,,
999,0.7842106223106384,5993.4,5995.9,So there's no clear threshold which we could Define.,,,
1000,0.7842106223106384,5996.0,6000.3,"So given those complications, I believe that eliminating that section is the best approach.",,,
1001,0.7842106223106384,6000.4,6008.3,I urge council members to support this amendment in the city council meeting today and tedward own from my office is available to discuss with council members staff.,,,
1002,0.7842106223106384,6008.3,6010.9,Any questions that they may have?,,,

1018,0.9073322415351868,6087.8,6099.6,We also had an initial briefing on this bill in committee so that we are able to act quickly in January when we will have another briefing public hearing and vote in committee next month.,,,

1043,0.8966014981269836,6249.8,6255.2,The answers were just simply that the information was unknown.,,,
1044,0.9020322561264038,6255.4,6260.9, So I do need to know what that it does not exceed a dangerous decibel level.,,,

1046,0.9020322561264038,6274.5,6279.2,And maybe I'm just simply missing why a tactical Advantage is needed in search and rescue.,,,
