318,0.8221497535705566,1609.9,1616.9,How do we bake in all of this back and work into our institutional memory so that we don't have to recreate the wheel next time.,,,

324,0.760312020778656,1637.5,1642.2,And but there are a few things that I think we could do right now.,,,

326,0.760312020778656,1651.2,1653.2,More resources could be put,,,
327,0.9128382205963135,1653.4,1663.4," Ward winter, severe weather shelter needs and so that might be one possibility where we have more than one provider.",,,

447,0.7967005968093872,2443.6,2450.3,Both for the operator and I think for for the folks that will utilize that shelter system as well.,,,
448,0.7870588898658752,2456.2,2459.3, I thought I know it's some sort of questions already.,,,
449,0.7870588898658752,2459.3,2463.7,I went to try to kind of work through a couple more slides here and then open it up to questions for folks.,,,
450,0.7870588898658752,2463.7,2468.0,So I do want to provide a quick update on the Hope team.,,,

454,0.8665477633476257,2502.6,2515.2,"And also, as we work toward sort of really Landing instead of of not just priority engagement, but the criteria by which we do.",,,
455,0.8236247897148132,2515.5,2521.3," Or a limited resources, but but that work is, is working.",,,
456,0.8236247897148132,2521.9,2526.6,I think that work is ongoing in this new sort of new paradigm.,,,
457,0.8236247897148132,2527.6,2535.1,"But, but again, I want to say, and I really thank the whole team and others for the work they did during our winter weather response.",,,
458,0.8236247897148132,2535.1,2537.7,I think councilmember Lewis and you were out and about that day.,,,

470,0.7719915509223938,2612.3,2619.6,"Frankly, that is very similar to the data that navigation team was required to, to collect.",,,
471,0.7719915509223938,2620.0,2634.8,"We think that's important for understand program, performance, individual service provider performance, and I'm frankly, just to have a better sense of who's being engaged, what services, they're being offered who accepted and so on and so forth.",,,
472,0.7719915509223938,2634.8,2635.4,I think that's a,,,
473,0.8358519077301025,2635.5,2637.9, Shared goal and making sure we have that data.,,,
474,0.8358519077301025,2638.6,2652.7,"I think is a really important piece of the ongoing work and engagement to help team is having with our contracted average providers with that council member or I will be quiet and director Howell, and I here are here to take questions.",,,

482,0.7918792366981506,2673.9,2675.4,I have a few questions.,,,
483,0.7918792366981506,2675.4,2681.6,"So if it's okay, maybe I'll just kind of them all out there and then we can have the conversation.",,,
484,0.7918792366981506,2682.7,2692.0,"The first thing is, we know that as one of the commenter's mentioned council did receive a letter recently from Nicholasville.",,,
485,0.7918792366981506,2692.5,2695.7,I'm stating that they hadn't received any updates on.,,,
486,0.901063084602356,2695.8,2698.9, Funding for the new self-governed tiny house Village.,,,
487,0.901063084602356,2698.9,2702.0,Clearly Lehigh is getting stood up.,,,
488,0.901063084602356,2702.0,2708.1,So I'm wondering why it's taking longer for the Nickelsville Villages.,,,
489,0.901063084602356,2708.1,2718.1,And if you can just talk a little bit because we have heard from some other organizations that they've had a civil similar experience receiving or not receiving updates.,,,
490,0.901063084602356,2718.1,2725.5,"So is the process different for smaller Community organizations, and if so, how can we make sure that they",,,
491,0.782171905040741,2725.8,2726.1, First.,,,
492,0.782171905040741,2726.1,2729.2,And they will be communicated with.,,,
493,0.782171905040741,2729.3,2730.8,That's kind of one question.,,,
494,0.782171905040741,2731.2,2743.5,"And then regarding the Hope him, we've had a lot of communication recently in my office folks, who are on housed, folks, who do a lot of mutual Aid.",,,
495,0.782171905040741,2743.5,2753.2,"Work have been really concerned about the way in which Parks or the community clean, teams are conducting cleanups around encampments.",,,
496,0.782171905040741,2754.6,2755.7,A lot of people.,,,
497,0.9013280272483826,2756.5,2765.8," Sort of losing property that was believed to be waste or trash, but was not in, you know, was still considered by the individuals themselves, to be their property.",,,
498,0.9013280272483826,2767.1,2775.2,You talk a little bit about if hope is notified about these cleanups and how they can mitigate those concerns.,,,
499,0.9013280272483826,2775.6,2778.6,"And then finally, I want to ask about",,,
500,0.8174236416816711,2780.8,2784.1, the just sort of the basic operations about hope.,,,
501,0.8174236416816711,2784.1,2785.7,We had a little bit of conversation.,,,
502,0.8174236416816711,2785.7,2786.7,The last time you were here.,,,
503,0.8174236416816711,2786.7,2796.8,"Deputy Mayor, that how hope is operating differently from what the navigation team had been doing or in what ways are they similar?",,,
504,0.8174236416816711,2797.7,2800.0,And how can we ensure that?,,,
505,0.8174236416816711,2800.0,2802.5,Hope really operates with the stated intent?,,,
506,0.8174236416816711,2802.5,2806.1,That was behind the budget amendment.,,,
507,0.8174236416816711,2806.1,2807.5,That was established.,,,
508,0.8174236416816711,2807.7,2810.0,So those are some of my main questions for now.,,,
509,0.8174236416816711,2810.0,2810.3,And I'll,,,
510,0.912838339805603,2811.2,2812.5, I'll mute and wait for your answer.,,,

512,0.912838339805603,2814.2,2815.0,Thank you.,,,
513,0.912838339805603,2815.2,2833.6,"Councilmember, if I might ask you to read restate a couple of those as we go here, but on the First on Nickelsville, you know, one of our challenges there were continuing to try to figure out how we work with Nickelsville.",,,
514,0.912838339805603,2835.2,2840.7,"You know, we do not have a master Services agreement with Nickelsville, which is a traditional way, in which we",,,

516,0.7251731157302856,2848.4,2853.2,"As you know, Nickelsville is completely unconnected to the rest of our system.",,,
517,0.7251731157302856,2854.0,2855.5,So we are not getting data.,,,
518,0.7251731157302856,2855.5,2857.1,We are not understanding efforts.,,,
519,0.7251731157302856,2857.1,2863.4,"They're making to connect folks, to long-term permanent housing, but that said we are working through that.",,,
520,0.7251731157302856,2863.4,2870.8,I will just simply say that from a staff perspective.,,,
521,0.7795214653015137,2870.9,2878.0, Spective we have the same folks trying to problem solve that or same folks that are working on setting up these new shelter assets.,,,
522,0.7795214653015137,2878.0,2890.2,So we have not forgotten about it and we will let me get a better more complete update for you and Counsel on where we are.,,,

525,0.7795214653015137,2897.4,2900.6,We know that we need to be exploring non-traditional.,,,

527,0.9080966114997864,2904.3,2915.7,"And so I know that they do not have the MFA, but how else might this work and do they need a Fiscal Agent of some sort, you know, we need to be exploring this and we'll be happy to follow up with you.",,,
528,0.9080966114997864,2918.1,2929.4,"And then on the second question, in terms of the clean, the sort of the intersection between Clean Cities work and and encampments we do, we are hope.",,,

540,0.8395997881889343,2961.0,2976.0, I'm here to try to also get information in and from from our Outreach continue about other ways that we can help to coordinate trash and refuse removal from encampments.,,,
541,0.8395997881889343,2976.8,2981.9,"And you know, whether that's abandoned tents or other other things or purple bag program.",,,
542,0.8395997881889343,2981.9,2988.3,So we we are trying to be as transparent and communicative as possible.,,,
543,0.8395997881889343,2988.3,2990.8,I think some of the folks that you referenced may not.,,,

546,0.8918973803520203,3004.8,3010.8,"I would say, you know, the Clean Cities team does have field coordinators assigned to it.",,,

723,0.8897228837013245,4021.4,4028.7,My understanding is that the Hope team prioritises safety and individual well-being.,,,
724,0.8897228837013245,4028.7,4044.1,"First, the physical distress of the individual environmental or traffic hazards, critical fire concerns, that impact safety, safety of schools and daycare and then kind of the next category would be sites.",,,
725,0.8897228837013245,4044.1,4044.8,Impacting.,,,
726,0.8156548142433167,4045.2,4053.8, Construction or City Maintenance projects and then the next category would be General impacts to neighborhoods or business.,,,
727,0.8156548142433167,4053.8,4067.9,"But as Deputy Mayor six killer suggested, we certainly can bring in the experts to talk in more detail about how it's working currently key director, how that's very very helpful information.",,,
728,0.8156548142433167,4068.3,4069.0,Appreciate it.,,,
729,0.8265208601951599,4070.7,4071.1, Great.,,,
730,0.8265208601951599,4071.1,4079.8,Thank you so much.,,,
731,0.8265208601951599,4079.8,4083.6,Thank you for that line of questioning council president Gonzalez.,,,
732,0.8265208601951599,4084.6,4086.4,"If you have a question, go ahead.",,,
733,0.8265208601951599,4087.3,4087.5,Yeah.,,,
734,0.8265208601951599,4087.5,4092.5,It's a little bit of a pile onto the last inquiry.,,,
735,0.8265208601951599,4092.5,4094.2,That comes member virbull made.,,,
736,0.7227051258087158,4095.5,4098.1, So I think I think I'm director Hal.,,,
737,0.7227051258087158,4098.1,4102.1,I really appreciated sort of hearing that prioritization.,,,
738,0.7227051258087158,4102.2,4104.7,That was a hadn't heard it.,,,
739,0.7227051258087158,4104.7,4107.4,"So clearly, and distinctly laid out.",,,
740,0.7227051258087158,4107.4,4108.6,So I appreciate that.,,,
741,0.7227051258087158,4108.6,4115.5,I do think that that because this is a shift in the way we're doing engagement and Outreach in.,,,
742,0.7227051258087158,4115.5,4116.0,This space.,,,
743,0.7227051258087158,4116.0,4121.9,"It would be welcome, you know, deeper dive into how it's working.",,,
744,0.7227051258087158,4121.9,4122.6,Would be welcome.,,,
745,0.7227051258087158,4122.6,4125.1,"Certainly from my perspective as a policy maker, but",,,
746,0.912838339805603,4125.2,4142.6," I also think that it would be beneficial to members of the public to get an understanding of what this is and what it isn't similar to what councilmember horrible just said, I did have an opportunity to have some conversation with folks, expressing concerns about about about.",,,
747,0.912838339805603,4142.6,4151.7,Some unsanctioned encampments that appear to be having neighborhood impacts on the Incorporated side of white center.,,,
748,0.912838339805603,4151.8,4155.0,And I think what I heard them say,,,
749,0.8842437863349915,4155.2,4161.2, Say is that that hope had done Outreach and then two weeks went by and nobody heard anything.,,,
750,0.8842437863349915,4161.2,4177.5,And so I think there's an opportunity to increase connectivity and communication between the work that is being done by hope team members and an impacted businesses.,,,
751,0.8842437863349915,4177.5,4181.6,"And, and I think that's really what I'm hearing Community folks.",,,
752,0.8842437863349915,4181.6,4185.2,Expressing is just sort of a lack of,,,
753,0.8514730334281921,4185.2,4194.5," Of communication in general and a desire to want to be kept informed about what they can expect to happen next, right?",,,
754,0.8514730334281921,4194.5,4205.2,"So, I think when we are moving from a model of navigation, team enforcement, focus of encampment removals to an Outreach and engagement model.",,,
755,0.7921133041381836,4206.4,4220.1, We need to make sure that people understand what that means in terms of how we're going to be interacting with both those experiencing homelessness and also the impact and surrounding neighborhood.,,,
756,0.7921133041381836,4220.1,4224.7,And and I'm nervous that that pieces really missing right now.,,,
757,0.7921133041381836,4224.7,4231.7,"And so, so I hope that we can have a more concerted strategic effort around, making sure that that communication is there.",,,
758,0.7921133041381836,4232.0,4236.0,And that people aren't left with the impression that just by virtue of engaging with hope.,,,
759,0.8758050203323364,4236.2,4243.5, That means that there's going to be a removal or other kind of enforcement action.,,,
760,0.8758050203323364,4243.5,4252.1,And so I like to I'll follow up with you all offline to sort of hear a little bit more about what kind of Engagement was being done.,,,
761,0.8758050203323364,4252.1,4258.1,"For that particular neighborhood, that that both councilmember will deny are referring to.",,,
762,0.8758050203323364,4258.7,4260.8,I made a commitment to get back to folks.,,,
763,0.8371446132659912,4262.2,4264.9, With a better understanding of what was going on there.,,,
764,0.8371446132659912,4264.9,4272.4,So look forward to having those offline conversations and appreciate your roles offer to come back.,,,
765,0.8371446132659912,4272.4,4276.1,And give us a deeper dive both for our benefit and the benefit of the viewing public.,,,
766,0.9040402770042419,4278.7,4290.0," Thank you council, president happy to have that conversation with you in certainly to follow up on that specific example, you gave.",,,
767,0.9040402770042419,4290.6,4300.0,"I would maybe do two things just to add one, just a clarification, the whole team as currently structured, is not itself doing that.",,,
768,0.9040402770042419,4300.0,4303.8,That Outreach that is being conducted.,,,
769,0.9040402770042419,4303.8,4307.3,"You know, through is made me being help coordinating.",,,
770,0.86164790391922,4307.5,4323.3," In sharing information with contracted Outreach providers, but I just I just want to make sure I want to make sure the council Morales knows that the whole team is out doing that, that direct personal engagement.",,,
771,0.86164790391922,4323.3,4337.2,"That wasn't, that was a big part of the, the whole team budget per language, but we are very much working with our contract and Outreach providers to flag those areas.",,,
772,0.804582417011261,4337.4,4359.4," He's one of the process Improvement areas that we're working with folks on is how we get that feed sort of close that Loop and both in making sure that you know, if we ask contracted Outreach to go out and do specific engagement of a specific encampment or individual that a, they're doing it and be that we get the feedback.",,,
773,0.804582417011261,4359.7,4365.0,If that issue has been resolved or if there are other services that they might need at the city can provide.,,,
774,0.804582417011261,4365.5,4367.2,So we're working through that.,,,
775,0.8326369524002075,4369.1,4376.6, But but I very much appreciate your your comments and happy to have that offline follow up.,,,
776,0.8091012835502625,4377.8,4380.5," Yeah, and I would just say that I think for members of the public.",,,
777,0.8091012835502625,4381.1,4386.4,You don't know the difference between hope team or a contracted service provider.,,,
778,0.8091012835502625,4386.4,4392.0,They just know that somebody is out there related to this particular issue.,,,
779,0.8091012835502625,4392.0,4395.7,And so I think regardless of what the label of the folks are.,,,
780,0.8091012835502625,4396.3,4407.4,"There is there's clearly something that is not connecting in terms of people feeling like something meaningful And Timely is occurring, right?",,,
781,0.8231826424598694,4407.6,4433.3," So our job as the ones who own the bureaucracy is to make sure that we're creating an opportunity for understanding and information sharing and information gathering and really strong communication with folks who are in the impact of neighborhood, but also folks are experiencing homelessness and it doesn't matter whether, you know, it's under the moniker of this or under the moniker of that.",,,
782,0.8231826424598694,4433.7,4437.4,"And so I just want to, I think, you know what, I'm when I'm communicating to",,,
783,0.7682415246963501,4437.5,4439.3, To you is that people were telling me.,,,
784,0.7682415246963501,4439.3,4442.2,It was the hope team that was out there.,,,
785,0.7682415246963501,4442.7,4467.4,"And so I think, I think that, you know, therein lies a little bit of the disconnect and and also an opportunity to really figure out how to do this work in a in a way that this sort of addresses, the underlying issues and and the need to connect people to Safe warm place to be while also making sure that that that impact",,,
786,0.8939141631126404,4467.9,4480.9," Neighbors in the area, understand that the city takes their concerns seriously and that we have a shared goal of addressing the issue with, with compassion and care.",,,
787,0.8939141631126404,4481.0,4490.1,"And I, and that's, that's sort of what I hope we can work work towards together here councilmember Gonzalez.",,,
788,0.8939141631126404,4490.1,4492.5,I just want to add that.,,,
789,0.8939141631126404,4493.3,4496.0,We're also adjusting to.,,,
790,0.8201854825019836,4497.5,4499.3, It's on Outreach providers.,,,
791,0.8201854825019836,4499.3,4501.8,So there's also an additional Communications.,,,
792,0.8201854825019836,4501.8,4510.5,"Real-time information is more difficult for the Hope team than it was for the navigation team because they literally employ, right.",,,
793,0.8201854825019836,4510.5,4513.4,It was a team that all work directly together.,,,
794,0.8201854825019836,4513.4,4525.7,"So we're adjusting to, you know, the contractual Arrangement being the guide and how to get more frequent Communications and and information in more real time.",,,
795,0.8201854825019836,4525.7,4527.4,So it's only,,,
796,0.8785510063171387,4527.6,4534.5," to not subtract from that list that you provided, but I just wanted to add that in mention that",,,
797,0.9128388166427612,4538.4,4538.7, Great.,,,
798,0.9128388166427612,4538.7,4539.8,Thank you so much.,,,
799,0.9128388166427612,4540.0,4544.0,"Councilmember Strauss, you're recognized.",,,
800,0.9128388166427612,4544.6,4545.3,Thank you chair.,,,
801,0.9128388166427612,4545.3,4546.0,And thank you.,,,
802,0.9128388166427612,4546.0,4548.1,Deputy mayor for being with us today.,,,
803,0.9128388166427612,4548.3,4556.2,My original question was has the hotel shelter unit count increased decreased or stayed the same from our budget conversation in the fall.,,,
804,0.9128388166427612,4556.2,4561.3,It sounds like from the earlier questions and answers that that number has decreased.,,,
805,0.9128388166427612,4561.5,4565.2,"So, my question is then what is being done to meet the original goal.",,,
806,0.9128388166427612,4565.4,4568.1,"Do you need more funds, allocated or is it a matter of?",,,
807,0.9128385186195374,4569.4,4571.9, Using the dollars that are already allocated.,,,
808,0.7258423566818237,4573.7,4577.1, I think it's a I think it's a few things councilmember.,,,
809,0.7258423566818237,4577.9,4584.8,I think I think is too early for us to know about funds.,,,
810,0.7258423566818237,4585.2,4592.8,I think really is just is getting getting this program up and running and really with this is something that we've never done before.,,,
811,0.7258423566818237,4593.6,4603.1,"And so I do think you know, we are experiencing the growth, pains a little bit, but I think once we get these things",,,
812,0.7215022444725037,4603.3,4605.3, Up and running and are able to work really high.,,,
813,0.7215022444725037,4605.3,4620.1,"And she see how Club to understand what their needs are and you know, what other resources or supports they may need or the program overall may need?",,,
814,0.7215022444725037,4620.3,4625.9,We will certainly not be bashful about identifying those for the council.,,,
815,0.7215022444725037,4626.3,4633.1,"But as I said in response to councilmember her gold, you know, we are focused on delivering what the council funded.",,,
816,0.7571645379066467,4633.2,4643.8," It and we'll are endeavoring to move that program for word beginning with these two, and these two hotels.",,,
817,0.7571645379066467,4644.0,4649.8,And then I think we'll continue to find ways to fill in the rest of that.,,,
818,0.7571645379066467,4650.0,4650.9,That commitment.,,,
819,0.7571645379066467,4651.5,4651.8,Thank you.,,,
820,0.7571645379066467,4651.8,4662.9,"Yes, please never hesitate to let us know how we can help, you know, these this surge investment from last year's budgeting process really is in my opinion, the down payment that we need to be making in.",,,
821,0.7987005114555359,4663.3,4668.5, The program is to be scalable to address the crisis at the scale that we're experiencing it.,,,
822,0.7987005114555359,4668.8,4669.2,One question.,,,
823,0.7987005114555359,4669.2,4686.1,I do have about the hotels that we are currently utilizing is case management present to house the hardest to house folks that have chemical dependency or behavioral health conditions or are we focusing on folks that are the easiest to House people that are already stabilized.,,,

867,0.885905385017395,4876.0,4881.5,And they're trying to Garner support for a bill down in Olympia that would allow us to exempt.,,,
868,0.885905385017395,4881.5,4885.1,Tiny home Villages from the secret program from cepa requirements.,,,
869,0.885905385017395,4885.1,4896.6,That is a is a mirror is can be a significant barrier to the timeline for delivering these projects.,,,
870,0.7972955107688904,4897.0,4899.9, I'll say though our with the selection of our Second Sight.,,,
871,0.7972955107688904,4899.9,4904.4,One of the reasons why we chose that was it would be very quick to stand up.,,,
872,0.7972955107688904,4905.1,4916.5,So we are trying to embrace expediency over may be the perfect and will certainly be applying that here.,,,
873,0.7972955107688904,4916.5,4925.9,"As we look at citing the third Village and then obviously through the work of you all, you know, if there are additional funding comes online, sliding additional Villages.",,,
874,0.7972955107688904,4925.9,4926.2,Well,,,

876,0.7939039468765259,4928.1,4934.1,"And the reason I pause just before that last question is, I had another question that I had not written down yet.",,,
877,0.7939039468765259,4934.1,4941.0,Came back to my mind in terms of the hoteling and us bringing on a high.,,,
878,0.7939039468765259,4941.0,4941.7,Number of units.,,,
879,0.7939039468765259,4941.7,4942.5,All at one time.,,,
880,0.7939039468765259,4942.5,4954.0,"Are we going to be able to move cohorts of people who are camping together outside together out of public space into these shelters, or are we going to be doing more of a piecemeal approach?",,,
881,0.716884434223175,4956.4,4959.3," You know, again, I can't speak to the cohort thing.",,,
882,0.716884434223175,4959.5,4960.9,I'm not being evasive.,,,
883,0.716884434223175,4960.9,4972.5,"I just those are that just as a layer of detail that I don't, I don't, I don't have, but just as a general matter, right, those referrals we done in coordination, with contracted Outreach through the whole team.",,,
884,0.716884434223175,4973.0,4985.2,"And you know, whether those individuals are navigated to a tiny home Village or the hotel unit or any other kind of shelter that we have in the system right now, you know, we again we try to do that based on the",,,
885,0.8372700810432434,4985.4,4991.2, Jewel in the field and and what makes the most sense for them longer-term.,,,
886,0.8372700810432434,4991.2,4994.0,"So, so I'm not saying no, I'm not saying yes.",,,
887,0.8372700810432434,4994.0,4996.6,"I just don't know, but but I know it's but we can flag.",,,
888,0.8372700810432434,4996.6,4997.8,That is something that we will.,,,
889,0.8372700810432434,4998.2,5007.0,I think as a follow-up either between now the next meeting or if we do have a deeper dive on with the whole team next month we can talk.,,,
890,0.8372700810432434,5007.2,5007.9,I'll make sure they're prepared.,,,
891,0.8372700810432434,5007.9,5008.6,Talk about that.,,,

893,0.8372700810432434,5009.6,5014.3,And you know the last question here and maybe this is setting us up for the next time you come.,,,
894,0.8372700810432434,5014.3,5015.1,The forest is,,,
895,0.8458605408668518,5015.3,5022.3," Is a bit to your last answer, which is that to have solutions to the scale of this crisis, the programs that we're investing in.",,,
896,0.8458605408668518,5022.3,5028.3,"Right now, as I said before, are the down payments to addressing the crisis at the scale that we're experiencing it.",,,
897,0.8458605408668518,5028.6,5035.3,"Meaning that if we know that we have 4,000 people living in our public space and we need to have four thousand places for people to go.",,,
898,0.8458605408668518,5036.0,5045.2,Can you share with me what you believe the barriers are to providing the level of shelter and housing that we are experiencing.,,,
899,0.8303311467170715,5045.3,5048.5, The need for is it just as I've heard before?,,,
900,0.8303311467170715,5048.5,5049.7,Funding is exciting.,,,
901,0.8303311467170715,5049.7,5051.9,Is it you share with me what your thoughts are.,,,
902,0.8303311467170715,5052.3,5053.7,I think it's a combination of things.,,,
903,0.8303311467170715,5053.7,5055.6,"I think most importantly, it's important.",,,
904,0.8303311467170715,5055.6,5072.3,"We have places for, we have places for people to go to, I don't, I don't know that that I agree that, that we need to have 5,000 units of shelter, space, for 5,000 individuals experiencing homelessness, but we need is places for people in.",,,
905,0.8303311467170715,5072.5,5074.9,We need more permanent housing for people to move into.,,,
906,0.8344746828079224,5075.8,5089.4," To create throughput in the shelter system and get people connected to those Services, whether it's psh or other services that they need to be successful outside of the shelter system, right?",,,
907,0.8344746828079224,5089.4,5093.1,"Was a shelter system was never designed, or should it be a sort of be the end state that?",,,

909,0.8344746828079224,5094.2,5096.7,"But, but I do think, you know, what?",,,
910,0.8344746828079224,5096.7,5105.1,We've tried to accomplish what we're trying to accomplish with our current hoteling program is again create a path.,,,
911,0.8122169375419617,5105.3,5108.9," For folks to come inside, have an exit plan for those folks.",,,
912,0.8122169375419617,5108.9,5120.7,"As they come inside, if that's rapid rehousing is that it's moving them to permanent Supportive Housing as those units start to become available toward the, you know, throughout the course of the year and or other units become available.",,,
913,0.8122169375419617,5121.2,5134.4,"You know, remember we're bringing 600 psh units online this year, that does not count the units that we are working partnership with the county executive's office about in terms of citing additional psh units in the city of Seattle.",,,
914,0.77692711353302,5135.2,5148.6," So, you know, I think again the combination of creating capacity in the shelter system, which is, which is being over utilized and has not as much throughput as it has it has had before with rapid rehousing and exits.",,,
915,0.77692711353302,5148.6,5152.3,From the hoteling or other shelters into permanent housing.,,,
916,0.77692711353302,5152.3,5165.1,"I think continues to be our goal and and of course in between those two things tells when there's a variety of of speed bumps along the way, but at the end of the day, I do think it is about creating more.",,,
917,0.8777642250061035,5165.4,5168.2, That homes for folks to end up in.,,,
918,0.8777642250061035,5168.7,5175.4,I completely agree that we need to keep our Capital dollars focused on building affordable housing and permanent Supportive Housing units.,,,
919,0.8777642250061035,5175.7,5178.7,"In my mind, that permanent Supportive Housing with comes online.",,,
920,0.8777642250061035,5178.9,5183.7,Should be counted against our total metrics of providing places for people to go.,,,
921,0.8777642250061035,5184.1,5194.9,A just also recognize that allowing people to suffer in the streets as we are doing today can not last for much longer because,,,

923,0.8193357586860657,5202.4,5210.7,And as I as I continue to think of it as our down payment towards being able to bring Solutions at the scale of this crisis.,,,
924,0.8193357586860657,5210.7,5211.4,So thank you.,,,

929,0.8193357586860657,5219.6,5221.8,I see councilmember curb old has another question.,,,
930,0.8193357586860657,5222.1,5225.1,I want to jump in and ask a couple questions real quickly and then,,,
931,0.8581016659736633,5225.6,5243.2," Have councilmember horrible close us out so we can move on to the next topic here, but I want to delve in a little bit to the rapid rehousing and I know that you know initially we had wanted 300 hotel rooms and we sort of talked a lot about that.",,,
932,0.8581016659736633,5243.2,5248.5,"And in this hearing today, I think that the way we've sort of set this up, the impact can be much greater.",,,
933,0.8581016659736633,5248.5,5251.2,If the rapid rehousing is firing on all cylinders.,,,
934,0.8581016659736633,5251.2,5254.8,"We're getting folks, you know, the casework to navigate through.",,,
935,0.8662918210029602,5255.6,5259.7, I wonder if you could maybe talk a little bit right now.,,,
936,0.8662918210029602,5259.7,5273.8,"Like if we're looking back at the end of 12 months, or there any estimates in the department, because I think I've seen some reporting on this on how many people total could be served and rapidly rehoused over the course of this program.",,,
937,0.9101375341415405,5275.7,5278.1, And how are you coming at those numbers?,,,
938,0.8889033794403076,5280.1,5285.8," So, our rapid rehousing and I'm just looking at one, make sure I use the right number council member.",,,
939,0.8889033794403076,5285.8,5287.9,I believe it's 220.,,,
940,0.8889033794403076,5291.9,5294.5,"Sorry, so many, so many numbers in front of me here.",,,
941,0.8113404512405396,5298.6,5306.6," It 230 230 units for Rapid rehousing again, our service provider.",,,
942,0.8113404512405396,5306.6,5313.4,"There is Catholic community services and you know, unlike our sort of traditional rapid rehousing program.",,,
943,0.8113404512405396,5313.4,5323.4,"I think, you know, we have expanded that the timeline for that program to try to help make it more.",,,
944,0.8113404512405396,5325.2,5326.9,I don't want to say more successful but,,,
945,0.762137234210968,5327.2,5339.4, To sort of recognize the unique period of time that were in and pairing it again with folks who are coming into our hotels shelter assets.,,,
946,0.762137234210968,5339.4,5345.8,It has a key component of our exit plan for individuals as they come into the hotels.,,,
947,0.762137234210968,5347.1,5356.9,"And so, but happy to do a deeper dive with you on on rapid rehousing and other ways that we could deploy rapid rehousing",,,
948,0.8685446381568909,5357.0,5363.2, Housing to two other strategies happy to do it.,,,
949,0.8685446381568909,5363.2,5365.4,But again our program is up to 12 months.,,,
950,0.8685446381568909,5366.1,5371.7,"So increased from what sort of the standard rapid rehousing program is for about 230, right?",,,
951,0.8685446381568909,5371.7,5372.8,So to follow up on that.,,,
952,0.8685446381568909,5372.8,5386.9,"I just want to make sure I understand how this will work when you say the two hundred and thirty units, does that mean we could conceivably be in a position where you know, we're able",,,
953,0.905819296836853,5387.1,5390.1, Move 230 people through these hotels.,,,
954,0.905819296836853,5390.7,5402.1,"So at any given time, the capacity of the hotel system could be about 200 people who are currently housed in a hotel and then we have a maximum of two hundred and thirty units.",,,
955,0.905819296836853,5402.1,5404.5,The way this has been laid out right now.,,,
956,0.905819296836853,5404.8,5406.9,That'll be like a permanent accommodation.,,,
957,0.905819296836853,5406.9,5407.2,I guess.,,,
958,0.905819296836853,5407.2,5410.9,I'm just getting a little confused with like are we talking about?,,,
959,0.7888497710227966,5413.9,5426.8," Like, does this the 230 units, inclusive of the hotels, or are we talking about like a separate chunk of units that are that are in addition that are going to help the people that are passing through.",,,
960,0.7888497710227966,5426.8,5428.5,Do you understand what I'm trying to convey?,,,
961,0.7888497710227966,5429.2,5431.8,"Yeah, it's a, it's a both, right?",,,
962,0.7888497710227966,5431.8,5441.8,"So, we'll be doing rapid rehousing for folks, that in the hotel system for, in the hotel shelter units, where that makes sense for those individuals.",,,
963,0.8175621032714844,5442.0,5442.2, Not.,,,
964,0.8175621032714844,5442.2,5449.8,"But also working, you know, I think again, as where as part of this surge is, is also utilizing rapid rehousing.",,,
965,0.8175621032714844,5450.9,5460.7,"If we, if we do encounter folks, as part of it as we're navigating them to new shelter units, that were it makes sense, you know, we'll do that as well.",,,
966,0.8175621032714844,5460.7,5470.2,"But again, the idea here is to keep, you know, we may have 230 or 220 rooms in our hotel program as we get started.",,,
967,0.8175621032714844,5470.2,5471.8,"The goal is, is not too.",,,
968,0.8649082779884338,5471.9,5483.6," Just serve 220 230 people over the course of the program but using rapid rehousing and other, you know, other supports to get folks out so we can keep moving people through.",,,
969,0.8649082779884338,5483.6,5491.0,"We even saw that our winter weather shelter is a couple weeks ago, you know, we were able to get, you know, just shy of 220 folks or so inside.",,,
970,0.8649082779884338,5491.0,5494.5,And then actually connect them to longer-term.,,,
971,0.8649082779884338,5495.0,5495.6,I'm shelter.,,,
972,0.8649082779884338,5495.6,5501.3,So we did have even turn over just in a few days or throughput just a few days of,,,
973,0.9128388166427612,5502.1,5502.6, Operation.,,,
974,0.9128388166427612,5502.6,5504.7,So I we're hopeful for how the hotel units will work.,,,
975,0.9128388166427612,5504.7,5507.9,"Then the same similar fashion, great.",,,
976,0.9128388166427612,5507.9,5510.7,And I just want to touch on a few other things really quick.,,,
977,0.9128388166427612,5511.1,5515.9,"We know that, you know, this will be kicking in.",,,
978,0.9128388166427612,5515.9,5519.8,"It looks like in mid-march, that's a little later than was initially anticipated.",,,
979,0.9128388166427612,5519.8,5523.2,"But obviously, there's a lot of logistical things that had to be nailed down.",,,
980,0.9128388166427612,5523.7,5529.1,Do we anticipate any savings from the implementation Delay?,,,
981,0.9128388166427612,5529.3,5531.9,From what the council appropriated given that it's,,,
982,0.8126556277275085,5532.1,5535.0, Adding a little later in the calendar than we thought it would be.,,,
983,0.8126556277275085,5535.5,5535.8,No.,,,
984,0.8126556277275085,5535.8,5538.8,"I just know we'll just you know, we've still anticipated.",,,
985,0.8126556277275085,5538.8,5548.4,"It's a 12, you know, it's a 12-month program and we will be be be we're not going to cut it off at the end of the year and Albion 12 our anticipation in working with you.",,,
986,0.8126556277275085,5548.4,5552.1,"I will be able to work 12, your program in 2022 at this point.",,,
987,0.7386287450790405,5553.3,5553.6, All right.,,,
988,0.7386287450790405,5553.6,5558.5,So it like it'll just kind of go a little longer on the other end is why you're saying yeah.,,,
989,0.7386287450790405,5558.5,5562.7,"Okay, and then finally I know it's been reported a little bit.",,,
990,0.7386287450790405,5562.7,5565.3,I just want to try to nail down the cost here.,,,
991,0.7386287450790405,5566.5,5575.9,That the the initial cost of seventeen thousand dollars per person is not all timidly the cause that's being used.,,,
992,0.7386287450790405,5576.3,5583.0,What ultimately was kind of settled on by the department for the the level of service.,,,
993,0.8619917631149292,5583.2,5585.5, Effectuate the program here.,,,
994,0.8619917631149292,5586.5,5590.4,We are still in negotiation with one of our providers council members.,,,

1410,0.7849881649017334,7668.4,7671.6,I think the last time we talked about the word voluntary in this context.,,,

1412,0.7849881649017334,7677.3,7682.7,"And the clarification was, it's actually the recipient that the recipient is voluntarily, receiving those.",,,
1413,0.7849881649017334,7682.7,7683.7,And I thought that was important.,,,
1414,0.8047434091567993,7683.9,7690.2, The Highlight so that no one thought we were asking for volunteers and not paying folks because that is also wage theft.,,,
1415,0.8047434091567993,7690.2,7694.0,So we do not support which stuff and just thought that that clarification was helpful.,,,
1416,0.8047434091567993,7694.0,7697.1,It's on the recipient who is voluntarily receiving those Services.,,,

1418,0.8047434091567993,7700.2,7708.3,I will also maybe just briefly say that we did talk to a number of stakeholders in the office of Housing and no major issues were raised with this amendment.,,,
