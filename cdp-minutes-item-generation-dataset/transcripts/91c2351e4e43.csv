68,0.97,572.705,599.432,In 2019 the Council approved a massive structure too connect the retail core with a waterfront at the Pioneer square . This action committed 185 million of Seattle taxpayer funding and also 176 million on property owners in the downtown court requiring $100 million of philanthropic contributions.,20,,
69,0.97,599.432,610.109,A lot can change in a year with the city facing a huge economic reversal with sales taxes to Olympic essential needs of the homeless population are not being met and bridges are crumbling that we must fund initiatives to overcome systemic racism.,20,,
70,0.97,610.109,613.145,Downtown has been abandoned.,20,,
71,0.97,613.145,616.782,Even before the pandemic the cost of doing business downtown was causing stores to close at an alarming rate.,20,,
72,0.97,616.782,639.572,Is not clear when tourism will recover and how can we justify a remodeling project when we cannot afford to house thousands on the streets?,20,,
73,0.97,639.572,654.687,"As you know, once the city begins collecting taxpayer assessments, you are legally obligated to fund the entire project, including any cost overruns and shortfall in the contribution the verdict is gone and Alaskan way is being restored.",20,,
74,0.97,654.687,658.891,"When completed, we will have a beautiful city Amenity with open space, water, and mountain views to be enjoyed by all.",20,,

83,0.97,682.214,692.792,This is Howard gale addressing police budget.,22,,
84,0.97,692.792,717.583,In this historic moment when we are really evaluating police we cannot fail to address all of the aspects of policing . What tasks are appropriate for officers who answer a cry for help with a gun but also how we hold them accountable when they inappropriately use that gun as they did in May against Terry Caver as he cried for help.,22,,
85,0.97,717.583,730.596,Depriving have as many people of constitutional rights and killing have as many people I do not think is the outcome that you all desire.,22,,
86,0.97,730.596,748.681,As you look at the public safety budget you must not just consider the failures of policing but also consider the near complete failure of our accountability system that spends almost $9 million each year you must ask yourself what accountability has this purchase for the 27 killed by SPD what accountability hasn't purchased for Terry Caver?,22,,
87,0.97,748.681,753.319,What accountability hasn't purchased for the hundreds of folks beaten and injured some very seriously by our police?,22,,
88,0.97,753.319,766.132,"In order to Reimagine policing, we must also Reimagine accountability and develop a system led by one accountable to the public.",22,,
89,0.97,766.132,780.913,"I recognize that a lot of people on the Council of very defensive about having set up the system for years ago, but again the data is simply not there as evidenced by the last four months to show that accountability is working.",22,,
90,0.97,780.913,795.694,So please Reimagine accountability along with policing and Reimagine how we can do that in a way that engages the community.,22,,
91,0.97,795.694,798.864,Please do not forget this important aspect in your ongoing issue identification in the coming budget.,22,,
92,0.97,798.864,809.108,Thank you.,22,,
93,0.97,812.945,815.281,Thank you so much we appreciate you calling him again today.,23,,

95,0.97,827.893,838.27,"So if you are still listening, you can have a few minutes to call in and just to give you a few more seconds I need to do something very procedural, David I would like to make sure that our agenda gets adopted for today so I skipped over that peace.",23,,
96,0.97,838.27,846.979,"If there is no objection, the agenda will be adopted . It is adopted.",23,,

100,0.97,849.014,851.984,It is David Haynes stuck in Seattle with no Backpay from a boss.,24,,
101,0.97,851.984,873.239,It is not fair that city council is Censoring our participation in democracy closing of Council chambers while making Life-Changing decisions without allowing the voice of the people when bars are open but not one government office is open.,24,,
102,0.97,873.239,884.55,It is always the same politically connected you are paid contractor Saturating the felons drowning out independent voices.,24,,
103,0.97,884.55,890.656,I'm calling today to demand that city council redirect all the earmarked money for Renters who are protected by an Eviction moratorium and get in is it citizens off the street.,24,,
104,0.97,890.656,902.101,It is obvious city council cares more for Renters who vote and volunteer for the campaign then to solve a six-year crisis.,24,,
105,0.97,902.101,933.799,"In fact, the new City Council is stepping back and allowing older Council was been around the budget block to innocent means of dollars needed for homeless crisis and been wrongfully used to subsidize credit score ratings at the expense of innocent Houseless for second by a Council filled with racist policies that guarantee the homeless will never be helped by getting them into a rental and Subjecting them to Subhuman shelters.",24,,
106,0.97,933.799,942.474,The only thing the Mayor cares about is buying of the organizers and funding the Nonprofits who intimidate with protest guaranteed never to be investigated.,24,,
107,0.97,942.474,965.731,"Shame on the city council for refusing to help 12,000 homeless and people make their living of the poor using tax dollars to Kickback the Council who pays their salary trading integrity for reelection support.",24,,
108,0.97,965.731,975.374,They complain about banks while actually making banks happy redirecting homeless money to banks who own all of the rentals while homeless people contract Covid-19.,24,,
109,0.97,975.374,978.711,The do not be surprised to see me pitching the tent in front of your comfortable home.,24,,

133,0.97,1223.155,1223.755,Thank you.,31,,
134,0.97,1223.755,1233.565,My question is not so much about the timetable but more about the form a's and B's.,31,,
135,0.97,1233.565,1248.447,"Form B needs a sponsor so how should a and to indicate they want to sponsor an open meeting if they are not raising hands, which is something you alluded to earlier?",31,,
136,0.97,1248.447,1249.881,Thank you for that question.,32,,
137,0.97,1249.881,1251.116,Aly do you have thoughts?,32,,
138,0.97,1251.116,1256.655,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",33,,
139,0.97,1256.655,1277.843,You can speak to each other about your proposals provided were not violating open public meetings and rules and so should be a discussion and a request for sponsorship if you are talking directly to each other with no more than three other Councilmembers because five makes up a Quorum.,33,,
140,0.97,1277.843,1290.022,"The chair will not be asking for a show of hands, but you can indicate and verbally say your support of your ask a question or that type of thing.",33,,
141,0.97,1290.022,1309.374,In addition if you are not able to obtain Co-Sponsorships given the limitations it is an option to still submit the request to central staff and we will work with you on the option of presentation for those videos off-line.,33,,
142,0.97,1309.374,1310.642,Let me just ask quickly.,34,,
143,0.97,1310.642,1321.486,This is a question to Councilmember Mosqueda program just curious why the decision was made to change the process.,34,,
144,0.97,1321.486,1332.798,I thought it was good to whatever extent it was it was a good way to really ask the question publicly to Councilmembers . do you support a given budget amendment?,34,,
145,0.97,1332.798,1352.084,I think that it is helpful for the public to see and they can suggest the asking of the question if it was a useful process in favor of democracy.,34,,
146,0.97,1352.084,1352.718,I'm just curious.,34,,
147,0.97,1352.718,1353.118,Absolutely.,35,,
148,0.97,1353.118,1364.73,I think the process is still going to be remaining in place on form B's when the official dollar must come forward.,35,,
149,0.97,1364.73,1377.442,We will definitely be asking for is to show indications of support at that point because many of the form a's are conceptual in nature.,35,,
150,0.97,1377.442,1380.445,A lot of folks in the past which is to say that sounds great.,35,,
151,0.97,1380.445,1397.763,I think that in order for us to get through this long list of form a's and that we will get into the sort of where the Councilmembers are weighing in on various supportive pieces that will come in form B's.,35,,
152,0.97,1397.763,1402.667,Absolutely if you want to weigh in and affix want to say am interested in this piece I am not discouraging people from doing that.,35,,
153,0.97,1402.667,1409.174,I just wanted to make sure that we had a streamlined process given the fact we have 150 form a's at this point.,35,,
154,0.97,1409.174,1413.678,I just want to make sure that we get through quickly so that we are not taken a hands on each one.,35,,
155,0.97,1413.678,1422.487,"As a reminder, I think that prior to the last few years we did have the process similar to what I'm describing, but I could be wrong.",35,,
156,0.97,1422.487,1424.156,"Any follow-up, Councilmember Sawant?",35,,
157,0.97,1424.156,1445.911,In the interest of the public might be watching this to register my opinion that I did not feel that that process in any way to not prevent the committee from being streamlined or timely in mentor but I do think it injected a little bit of transparency by asking the question in public.,36,,
158,0.97,1445.911,1461.927,"I'm not so much concerned about me expressing agreement which I will add as I have, but I just thought about asking the question actually puts pressure on Councilmembers to give us order to stay silent.",36,,
159,0.97,1461.927,1462.928,That is also a position.,36,,
160,0.97,1462.928,1464.196,I just wanted to register that.,36,,
161,0.97,1464.196,1466.131,Please go ahead.,37,,
162,0.97,1466.131,1519.584,"Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Mosqueda, some of the considerations that went into the decision by the limitations on the availability of central staff to work on the Council budget actions and statement of legislative intent and we have as the chair indicated in the past done this sometimes were only one Councilmember needed to be the sponsor in order to launch a level of effort that was sometimes considerable to put together a potential Council budget action and another years we have done set up what required three cosponsors to warrant that level of effort from central staff.",38,,
163,0.97,1519.584,1552.384,This year for form a's ideas that Councilmembers wants to insert into issue Id papers it was on the order of 150 ideals that Councilmembers had in anticipation of that level of interest staff suggested that we may not be able to accommodate the attendant workload of putting together Council budget actions for all of those.,38,,
164,0.97,1552.384,1554.819,It was her suggestion that we consider moving.,38,,
165,0.97,1554.819,1575.44,The chair obviously had to make a decision about how to allocate staffing resources.,38,,
166,0.97,1575.44,1577.242,"Thank you for raising the question, Councilmember Sawant.",39,,
167,0.97,1577.242,1582.347,I will have discussions over the next days with the chance to have that democratic process as well throughout the rest of the budget deliberations.,39,,
168,0.97,1582.347,1589.421,Especially as we get to form B's . with that let's have the clerk read into the record item 2.,39,,
169,0.97,1589.421,1597.963,Agenda item 2. general fund balancing analysis for briefing and discussion.,40,,
170,0.97,1597.963,1615.08,Thank you so much and we already have Tom Mikesell with us and we will also be joined by lise Kaye I believe is part of the budget team here and thank you again to Aly and Dan for continuing to be present on this agenda item.,41,,
171,0.97,1615.08,1647.846,I will say thank you to Tom and the team for providing the memo that I hope folks had a chance to read through the 15 page memo that was a helpful description of the slide so you will see and to Tom and lise for your presentation today and lise I believe you will be covering quarter three and Tom the overall funding stream and I will turn it over to Aly for introductions.,41,,
172,0.97,1647.846,1655.887,"Thank you, chairman Mosqueda.",42,,
173,0.97,1655.887,1679.811,Lise Kaye prepared a memo on the third-quarter supplemental with the proposed ordinance that informs the analysis and discussion that Tom will tee up today and she is available to answer questions but it will primarily be Tom that your hearing from.,42,,
174,0.97,1679.811,1719.684,"Dan, lise and I will Chime in as appropriate . started with the discussion today, Tom will walk through a high-level review of the proposed general fund budget and the framing and the slides considers what was the city phase in before the Council adopted the payroll expense tax in July and how did that change after the adoption of the tax and how things change after incorporating the Mayor's proposed $100 million investment for the initiative.",42,,
175,0.97,1719.684,1727.792,There is of course other ways the ordering of these changes could be presented in the analysis using the frame of the adopted policy of the Council that was adopted through Ordnance and resolution for the Jumpstart spending plan.,42,,
176,0.97,1727.792,1730.862,Regardless of the ordering the bottom line that will be presented will remain the same.,42,,
177,0.97,1730.862,1733.698,Without it will turn over to Tom.,42,,
178,0.97,1733.698,1735.266,"Thank you, Aly.",43,,
179,0.97,1735.266,1750.381,"That afternoon, chair Mosqueda and members of the select budget committee.",43,,
180,0.97,1750.381,1756.421,I hope you have any chance to read the 14 page memo that was Referenced by chair Mosqueda.,43,,
181,0.97,1756.421,1763.128,I will be giving a Hand- lettered overview to this presentation in reference back to the higher level of detail that is covered in the memo as a guide as we walk through.,43,,
182,0.97,1763.128,1785.116,There is a lot to cover and I'm going to hit the key points though always able and welcome questions as they may arise . So the first thing would like to cover on this slide in particular is why the general fund.,43,,
183,0.97,1785.116,1798.196,This is a key distinction because the general fund is the one fund of the city that almost all departments that provide services have some participation in.,43,,
184,0.97,1798.196,1810.708,Some are completely funded by the general Fund and some receive a share of their money from the general Fund and others.,43,,
185,0.97,1810.708,1830.662,"It is significant in that nearly all of the services have some general fund participation . Let me pause here and ask if folks can hear me clearly, just to check . Okay.",43,,
186,0.97,1830.662,1830.962,Excellent.,43,,
187,0.97,1830.962,1844.909,Another reason to think about the general Fund and why it is important is that is characterized by having a funding largely through tax revenues.,43,,
188,0.97,1844.909,1879.444,"When I say taxes, with the property taxes, sales taxes, when people make purchases, and payroll expense tax with the new payroll expense tax that was adopted by the Council in the summer and Utilitytaxes that are also paid by businesses.",43,,
189,0.97,1879.444,1881.779,Those are the reasons why we focus on the general fund uniquely.,43,,
190,0.97,1881.779,1888.052,The transportation Fund and utility fund does have their own special funding streams and unique characteristics by the general fund is important because it generally affects most city services.,43,,
191,0.97,1888.052,1888.519,"Next flight, please?",43,,
192,0.97,1888.519,1902.233,This is a broad outline of the topics we will cover . I will touch fairly briefly on the status of 2020.,43,,
193,0.97,1902.233,1918.483,We spent a significant amount of time this summer addressing the revenue problem caused by the Covid crisis and Council providing additional support for the community.,43,,
194,0.97,1918.483,1966.664,"So there is important things to point out with regard to the status of that balancing exercise and where we are now with implications that carry over into 2021, which will be the bulk of the presentation talking about the different elements of the Mayor's proposal and how it into place with the payroll expense tax that was recently adopted is awesome key funding issues that will be before you as you get into deeper budget deliberations in ensuing meetings and finally the memo causes the different sections and RAISES issues for identification.",43,,
195,0.97,1966.664,1970.868,This presentation will keep those toward the end raising the issues and post the different options that we have identified for resolution.,43,,
196,0.97,1970.868,1974.505,"Next flight, please?",43,,
197,0.97,1974.505,1984.115,This is a very high-level the practices two through six of the memo in the first row of the table is the adopted Buget.,43,,
198,0.97,1984.115,1987.318,This is the level of revenue.,43,,
199,0.97,1987.318,1996.26,That is the source is called and the expenditures from those revenues with the use column that was adopted last fall.,43,,
200,0.97,1996.26,2006.571,That was the plan that we went into this year with until the Covid crisis hit and adjustments were necessary.,43,,
201,0.97,2006.571,2013.578,"Technical and supplemental changes, these are standard adjustments that are meeting every fiscal year.",43,,
202,0.97,2013.578,2029.394,It is basically the term of the prior year transpired making adjustments like carryforwards and things of that nature.,43,,
203,0.97,2029.394,2048.045,If you look at the right column you can see there is a tracking total as you go down to these rows that show the impact that each one of these items have on the general fund balance in 2020.,43,,
204,0.97,2048.045,2070.701,Those technical and supplemental adjustments had a very small impact to the balance but the covert relief and recovery had a substantial impact on the balance . This was largely funding provided through the C.A.R.E.S.,43,,
205,0.97,2070.701,2091.222,"Act, funding provided by Council for small business relief and community investments to help the community cope with the crisis . that had a net impact of $57 million to the general fund largely because of the Recharacterization of our workforce into doing substantially different functions.",43,,
206,0.97,2091.222,2101.065,Some amount of Federal money was able to support existing appropriations that were originally intended for one thing and then were directed toward Covid relief measures.,43,,
207,0.97,2101.065,2129.16,"The third to last column revised forecast and summer rebalancing practices largely the August forecast by CBO to the city council demonstrating the losses in sales tax, property tax, and some property tax laws essentially at a 15% cut in the financing plan for the general fund at the start of the year.",43,,
208,0.97,2129.16,2159.657,"On the uses side, that represents predominantly the summer revision Ordnance practices key to the overall analysis becomes part of the investment that was adopted in the summer rebalancing was a $14 million community investments for community safety.",43,,
209,0.97,2159.657,2175.239,"The intent in that bill, which was vetoed by the Mayor but overwritten by the Council is to provide $14 million in community investments from an Interfund loan in bill 863.",43,,
210,0.97,2175.239,2192.757,The override letter was presented by the Mayor's office to Council indicating the investments would be made though the Interfund loan would not be processed by the budget office.,43,,
211,0.97,2192.757,2214.378,"That essentially left a $13 million hole, which was the amount of the Interfund loan intended to come from the construction Fund and to be repeated in 2021 through the reduction to the police Department budget for the payroll extent stacks and that did not occur.",43,,
212,0.97,2214.378,2242.306,"There is proposed future rebounds in managers like Q3 and the fourth quarter supplemental and a small amount of administrative adjustments that have been proposed and we are aware of from the city budget office; however, we have not been presented with an alternative funding source that $13 million Interfund loan that is not going to be issued.",43,,
213,0.97,2242.306,2247.612,"The bottom line, what 2020 is left with is a $4.9 million balance.",43,,
214,0.97,2247.612,2288.519,"Which is positive, however the key point is particular slide which is detailed on page 6 of the memo is at the 2021 budget, which starts from however we ended 2020, the budget presented by the Mayor actually depends on the $18 million starting balance . so that is the $13 million difference which when we get to issue identification later will be one of the key Takeaways . next slide, please?",43,,
215,0.97,2288.519,2314.445,And this is essentially what I just said so you can probably go to the next slide because this is the key take away we will now launch into the discussion of the different elements of the 2021 proposed budget . First we will talk about the baseline process.,43,,
216,0.97,2314.445,2326.457,This is a way of looking at how to start 2021 basically using the 2020 budget and adjusting it for different Measuresto bring it in line with the current level of services in 2021.,43,,
217,0.97,2326.457,2370.735,"Then we will do a slide covering the net reduction and the proposed budget of the Mayor talked about the payroll expense tax revenue that is in the Mayor's proposed budget and we will then cover the cost of implementing the tax and the cost of additional Covid relief in the budget we will touch on the Mayor's proposed community initiative and implications for the fiscal reserves, which is not in the general fund but an important fiscal relief measure in the city.",43,,
218,0.97,2370.735,2378.109,"Next slide, please?",43,,
219,0.97,2378.109,2415.746,"So the next few slides as references to page 8 of the memo in terms of the detail that is, you will see a series of slides that will be similar to this in each one is a tracking the impact that that particular adjustment that we talked about Handson the general fund balance and status you want to say balancing status, which I will probably say quite frequently, it is essentially how much a revenue is above or below the expenditures.",43,,
220,0.97,2415.746,2429.293,"In this case, you can see in the upper left-hand corner of this slide the little table resources and expenditures.",43,,
221,0.97,2429.293,2455.519,"In terms of starting the budget for 2021, the city budget office would take the 2020 adopted budget and then make a number of adjustments to that number two simulator estimate what it costs to provide the 2020 level of adopted services in 2021.",43,,
222,0.97,2455.519,2456.921,And that is what this reflects.,43,,
223,0.97,2456.921,2464.428,In the expenditure line it reflects the amount of that service and that level of service and then the baseline revenue forecast.,43,,
224,0.97,2464.428,2471.202,You can see the Bargraph representation of that.,43,,
225,0.97,2471.202,2480.144,It is at $1.4 million and approximately $1 billion I'm sorry.,43,,
226,0.97,2480.144,2500.564,You have the resources of $1.24 million and then on the bottom side of the bottom line the take away from this slide is after the current service level estimate of the budget there is a $191 million shortfall.,43,,
227,0.97,2500.564,2513.077,So the expenses that you need to cover the baseline is $191 million more than the amount of money available to pay for them.,43,,
228,0.97,2513.077,2520.885,"Next slide, please?",43,,
229,0.97,2520.885,2546.844,"We will start then given that there is a shortfall identified in the base level of service and the Mayor's proposed that general fund reductions, and you will see in the upper Left- hand side that the revenue largely stays the same and expenditures become a bit slower because there about $27 million of net reduction.",43,,
230,0.97,2546.844,2576.206,There is someplace in the budget where there is a reduction in one Department and an increase in another . a good example of that is parking enforcement that is moving from the police Department budget to the Transportation Department budget.,43,,
231,0.97,2576.206,2581.145,Also similarly there is a reduction of the 911 call center from police Department budget into a newly created emergency creation center.,43,,
232,0.97,2581.145,2602.967,Those are cut in one place and added to another adding out to essentially zero these topics will be covered in greater detail in the Department presentations later on in the issued liberation schedule but I just wanted to provide a broader level description of what I mean by net.,43,,
233,0.97,2602.967,2610.574,Plus and minus the reductions the Mayor's budget hundred 28.7 Million-Dollar operating reduction.,43,,
234,0.97,2610.574,2619.083,You can generally see it in the graph on the right that the expenditures vary slightly.,43,,
235,0.97,2619.083,2633.797,Still looking at the yellow shaded bar at the bottom the general function call is reduced to but it is still expenditures $163 million more than the revenue.,43,,
236,0.97,2633.797,2637.401,"Next slide, please?",43,,
237,0.97,2637.401,2659.39,"Council adopted in the summer in July the payroll expense tax, which is a tax on large business payroll expenses, as you are familiar with the estimated revenue from that tax, which the Mayor has built into the budget is $214 million.",43,,
238,0.97,2659.39,2678.409,That has a number of specific uses that were detailed in both and ornaments crafting a spending plan for 2021 as well as a resolution that indicated with those resources would be used for in the years thereafter.,43,,
239,0.97,2678.409,2706.27,"In this case is a general fund revenue source so that fuses could cover Covid relief, tax implementation and continuity of service, which are all general fund expenses we at that $214 million to the $163 million shortfall and as you can see in the upper left-hand corner the actual calculation has changed.",43,,
240,0.97,2706.27,2724.955,It is inverted in fact . There is $51 million more resources in the state and their expenditures and on the Bargraph on the right the resources are higher than expenditures . that is where we are at that stage of the analysis.,43,,
241,0.97,2724.955,2726.59,There are a few more steps to go.,43,,
242,0.97,2726.59,2728.992,"Next slide, please?",43,,
243,0.97,2728.992,2743.073,This just folds and those costs that are attached and dedicated in the Jumpstart spend plan.,43,,
244,0.97,2743.073,2750.38,There is a percentage that is lot for a payroll tax implementation showing the $3.3 million in finance administrative services to implement the tax.,43,,
245,0.97,2750.38,2779.343,It also shows the enhanced amounts that are in the budget for Covid relief across different departments totaling $21.7 million . We at those additional costs to the expenditure and the balance now becomes $27.3 million in the bar chart on the right slowly becomes closer.,43,,
246,0.97,2779.343,2781.145,But it is still a net positive number.,43,,
247,0.97,2781.145,2787.451,"Next slide, please?",43,,
248,0.97,2787.451,2818.949,This is where we had in to the significant new addition of resources in the Mayor's budget and this is the equitable communities initiative this is $100 million that would be put in reserves with a task force formed to guide the distribution of those resources so it is essentially $100 million of additional cost that is added to the calculation.,43,,
249,0.97,2818.949,2825.923,That brings the general fund balance to a negative 72.75.,43,,
250,0.97,2825.923,2833.564,Essentially now we are looking at a revenue shortfall in the general fund.,43,,
251,0.97,2833.564,2843.073,"Next slide, please?",43,,
252,0.97,2843.073,2853.083,"And so the Mayor's proposed budget includes $72.7 million from the city fiscal reserves, and when you add those resources in you now have a balanced budget.",43,,
253,0.97,2853.083,2855.786,This Isessentially the revenue matching the expenditures in the budget.,43,,
254,0.97,2855.786,2895.192,"If we look at the next slide, you can see what the final tally is for the city's fiscal reserves after that use . So we started for Covid the budget had $127 million between both reserves . The budget of revisions ordinance this summer used about $29 million from the revenue stabilization fund.",43,,
255,0.97,2895.192,2908.572,"There is a compromise legislation that is proposed that leaves another $19 million this year from the emergency Fund, though I'm not sure that has been drafted yet.",43,,
256,0.97,2908.572,2927.291,"The 2021 beginning balance includes both of those items that we start in the proposed Mayor's budget with $78.9 million and the proposed budget uses $72.7 million of these remaining reserves, leaving our office in 2021 and $6.2 million.",43,,
257,0.97,2927.291,2933.196,"Next slide, please?",43,,
258,0.97,2933.196,2980.644,"The key Takeaways . looking back at the 2021 budget for the 2020 budget as discussed, because of the Non-Issuance of the Interfund loan that was part of the financing plan for the budget provision, we are out of bounds by $13.1 million . next an important take when I frankly do not highlight this earlier, but it is part of the third-quarter balancing package and that the Mayor's 2020 balancing proposal so is in the third quarter supplemental assumes $30 million from the investment fund.",43,,
259,0.97,2980.644,3004.434,This was an amount that was funded from Mercer mega block proceeds last year and was put in this Finance general to form the interdepartmental team with the community to determine how to make investments in area with high risk of displacement and global access to opportunity.,43,,
260,0.97,3004.434,3010.14,The Mayor's budget cuts this amount in order to balance the program.,43,,
261,0.97,3010.14,3022.986,"Further, as we have seen, the proposed budget relies heavily on the fall line of the payroll expense tax.",43,,
262,0.97,3022.986,3035.999,It was on $27 million and brings the city fiscal reserves to $6.1 million.,43,,
263,0.97,3035.999,3063.427,This is a critical item because including the payroll expense tax the executive has noted that we are dealing with a new tax source that we are unfamiliar with and there's always legal risk with any tax source that we have.,43,,
264,0.97,3063.427,3064.661,This one would be no exception.,43,,
265,0.97,3064.661,3065.495,It is heightened uncertainty.,43,,
266,0.97,3065.495,3069.132,"In addition, we are still in the Covid pandemic and a lot of uncertainty on the horizon.",43,,
267,0.97,3069.132,3074.237,Bringing the fiscal reserves down to $6.1 million is a key distinction.,43,,
268,0.97,3074.237,3075.705,What we have your pause here.,44,,
269,0.97,3075.705,3078.308,Right at the end of the summary of the slide?,44,,
270,0.97,3078.308,3080.143,Yes.,45,,
271,0.97,3080.143,3106.036,"Before we continue on with the other slides to come on the issues, I want to make sure that all of this is fully digested and that we absorb the ways in which the revenue streams are being proposed to be used . If you could back up one slide for us?",46,,
272,0.97,3106.036,3106.837,Thank you so much.,46,,
273,0.97,3106.837,3170.634,"I think this illustrates the crisis that is not only in front of us right now but as Tom just concluded the concern that we all have with how long this Potetial depression may impact residence in Seattle and help a downturn in the economy means that more families need to turn to the city and other forms of government for support and without stable revenue coming in the door in light of the fact that the progressive payroll tax has been used in the reduction in the fiscal reserves goes down to $6.1 million, just wanted to pause here for a second and make sure that folks get the chance to ask any questions that they have about slides they've already seen.",46,,
274,0.97,3170.634,3171.668,"Please go ahead, Councilmember Strauss.",46,,
275,0.97,3171.668,3182.212,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",47,,
276,0.97,3182.779,3184.08,"Tom, thank you for this presentation.",47,,
277,0.97,3184.08,3184.748,It is very helpful.,47,,
278,0.97,3184.748,3186.516,I do have a question about this slide.,47,,
279,0.97,3186.516,3188.151,You might not have the information right now.,47,,
280,0.97,3188.151,3206.069,I would be curious to understand how this rapid reduction in reserves compared to the rate at which they spent these reserves following the 2008 recession and how the rate of spending relates to the recovery Timeline for this recession as compared to 2008.,47,,
281,0.97,3206.069,3213.376,"And if you do not have the information right now, I would be happy to follow up with you after this meeting.",47,,
282,0.97,3213.376,3217.047,"Thank you for the question, Councilmember Strauss . I do not have the detail.",48,,
283,0.97,3217.047,3243.607,It was a bit more delayed in that we got hit by the great recession and then the response was necessary fiscal measures protracted as opposed to how we were heavily hit though I will follow-up with you with a more detailed depiction of that trend.,48,,
284,0.97,3243.607,3257.087,"Excellent question, Councilmember Strauss comparing how the drawdown compares here in the proposed usage versus the way in which it was used in the previous recession.",49,,
285,0.97,3257.087,3258.021,Excellent question.,49,,
286,0.97,3258.021,3271.568,"Additional questions? did you have anything, Councilmember Sawant or Councilmember Morales?",49,,
287,0.97,3271.568,3271.768,Okay.,49,,
288,0.97,3271.768,3284.881,"Not seen any additional questions right now, please feel free to raise any questions at the end as well.",49,,
289,0.97,3285.815,3286.116,Okay.,49,,
290,0.97,3286.116,3294.357,"So just so that I am clear on the summary here, sounds like the Mayor's proposed budget has no identified source for the $100 million commitment Besides using funding from the Jumpstart payroll tax and drying down the reserves.",49,,
291,0.97,3294.357,3331.094,"The funding that would've mother was gone from the payroll tax into things like rental assistance, Childcare support, making sure that those services and preventing Layouts those issues in our spend plan as your memo notes has been put to the side and the revenues lumped together in the general Fund and have been pulled from and to run down the reserves to make up that commitment.",49,,
292,0.97,3331.094,3331.695,Is that correct?,49,,
293,0.97,3331.695,3339.202,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",50,,
294,0.97,3339.202,3340.003,That is a great question.,50,,
295,0.97,3340.003,3374.437,"It is by virtue of going into the general fund becomes used for any purpose, although that is exactly the reason why we show the specific pieces for the implementation and the Covid response and then everything else is essentially continuity of service, which is a key use.",50,,
296,0.97,3374.437,3378.842,There is no distinction beyond that point we tried to demonstrate what continuity of service with me from a baseline perspective.,50,,
297,0.97,3378.842,3395.625,That was a way of ordering the analysis to show how after paying for the payroll expense tax implementation and addressing the Covid emergency there would still be a positive balance left over in the fund.,50,,
298,0.97,3395.625,3412.876,"That was the kind of way to do that, lacking more specific strings attached in the budget to do that.",50,,
299,0.97,3412.876,3414.944,"Aly, did you have something to add to that?",51,,
300,0.97,3414.944,3416.646,I saw you coming on camera as well.,51,,
301,0.97,3416.646,3420.984,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",52,,
302,0.97,3420.984,3428.091,I was just making myself available if there was more questions about how the Mayor's proposed budget compares to the adopted spending plan for the payroll expense tax.,52,,
303,0.97,3428.091,3432.796,I am happy to go into further detail if you want.,52,,
304,0.97,3432.796,3443.973,It seems like Tom we have answered the question.,52,,
305,0.97,3443.973,3448.211,Of I can add it is in the memo on the last page with regard to the Sustainability concept.,53,,
306,0.97,3448.211,3477.907,"Because of the resolution of the Council to only do a one year budget we would normally do two years, we are only looking at 2021 and then decisions would be made in 2022 next fall . However, there is a financial plan that has been presented by the city budget office, and they do a financial plan with every budget.",53,,
307,0.97,3477.907,3495.758,"It is nothing you, but it is important to understand that financial plan and how the decisions that are in this budget into we particularly with regard to the payroll expense tax.",53,,
308,0.97,3495.758,3503.8,There is just two pieces that I just wanted to highlight understand we are not making decisions about 2022 and we have this guidance in the financial plan that is instructive.,53,,
309,0.97,3503.8,3522.852,"One is that the Mayor's equitable community's initiative at $100 million, so it is proposed in the current year budget, and it is included . There is an amount that was included in future years.",53,,
310,0.97,3522.852,3530.693,"It is included at $100 million in the general governmental program, though it is precisely not clear that it is for the initiative.",53,,
311,0.97,3530.693,3556.619,But there is money from the is available from the general fund with a $400 million commitment on an ongoing basis . The budget book indicates that that amount of that investment is an ongoing investment although there's also been communication that perhaps it is intended that there will be the alternative revenue streams identified for the investment in the future.,53,,
312,0.97,3556.619,3586.416,"Again we're not making 2022 decisions, and there is difference with what is in the budget but suggested is an ongoing investment in just reason that is an issue because it is the parent expense tax that has a specific plan in the resolution that indicates the housing investment and things of that nature.",53,,
313,0.97,3586.416,3590.019,"The decision does not have to be made, but I'm just raising the point.",53,,
314,0.97,3590.019,3609.105,"Further, because the payroll expense tax is baked into the financial plan in the future, it is assumed to be part of the general fund revenue services going forward.",53,,
315,0.97,3609.105,3619.415,Again it is a key point to understand how the new resolution relates to the plan they were looking at how and my future decisions could look like based on that set of assumptions.,53,,
316,0.97,3619.415,3646.209,I just wanted to raise that because it is a Sustainability issue not so much in the financial plan that CBO is shown with a balanced budget in the future but it is just I want to raise that as a concept.,53,,
317,0.97,3646.209,3646.509,Okay.,54,,
318,0.97,3646.509,3649.612,I just have timber follow-up questions on that and I believe I see Councilmember Morales.,54,,
319,0.97,3649.612,3651.28,"If there's others, please let me know.",54,,
320,0.97,3651.28,3656.619,"Councilmember Sawant, thank you purchased two summers on this point, and you mentioned this, Tom and we repeated this a number of times this year.",54,,
321,0.97,3656.619,3719.749,"The Council put firm parameters and action around the Jumpstart payroll tax so that there would not be criticism that there was not to spend plan but there would be priority as outlined by the Council in conjunction with community partners who were supporting progressive payroll tax so that dollars could be invested in supporting those who are being affected by Covid right now, making sure that there was prevention from cuts and layoffs and austerity in 2021, and in 2022 and beyond investments in housing, making sure that there is a equitable initiative, grinned Donna summer, all of those issues to have a positive impact on Low- wage workers and black and Brown communities and are important for us to remember that resolution 31957 and Council bill 9811 had clear direction of how we intended those dollars to be spent.",54,,
322,0.97,3719.749,3742.972,"That was the important point that when we look at the slide here and is covered in your memo, is it accurate to say that there is not a plan filled in as the Jumpstart proposal had articulated for the first dollars to go back to the reserves?",54,,
323,0.97,3742.972,3747.009,Is not a proposal that accompanies this drawdown to pay back the reserves in the proposed budget of the Mayor?,54,,
324,0.97,3747.009,3774.036,"Chair Mosqueda, I would say that there is not a discrete repayment in 2021; however, the analysis that we put together in these slides, there is a 2021 commitment for Covid.",55,,
325,0.97,3774.036,3797.126,That is underway a way of adding that into the analysis that is essentially using the peer expense tax surplus that was created to show that there is some element of Covid relief that is being funded.,55,,
326,0.97,3797.126,3804.066,"So it is not necessarily a specific payback but there is the element of the that being said, there is no additional payback of the other monies that were used this year.",55,,
327,0.97,3804.066,3831.127,"The amount specific to Covid as part of the compromise proposal that the Council and the Mayor's office reached over two years, 19 and 2020 and then 20 and 2021. specific to how we repay the use of the revenue stabilization fund there is not a strategy build and to put those dollars back in in this proposal.",56,,
328,0.97,3831.127,3831.561,Is that accurate?,56,,
329,0.97,3831.561,3848.811,"The budget I would say in the financial plan that I reference that is in the budget book, there are mounds going back to the Reserve and the emergency fund in future years.",57,,
330,0.97,3848.811,3863.693,"By way of the payroll tax been part of that analysis, essentially it does Institute some level of payback . I do not have the specific amount at my fingertips.",57,,
331,0.97,3863.693,3868.03,This is based on a slate of assumptions in the financial path.,57,,
332,0.97,3868.03,3877.94,"That being said, I would give some credence to the fact that there is in the plan some element of paying these reserves.",57,,
333,0.97,3877.94,3879.342,"Not next year, though in future years.",57,,
334,0.97,3879.342,3884.213,"Thank you, very much.",58,,
335,0.97,3884.213,3915.411,My recollection and Tom please correct me if I'm Off- base here . that the financial plan assumes that the city will begin to repay the revenue stabilization fund beginning in 2022 and by the end of 2024 those funds will be nearly back up to the 2021 beginning balance amount and do something like $74 million by the end of 2024.,59,,
336,0.97,3915.411,3942.972,Exactly what resources are used whether that is the Jumpstart Seattle payroll tax or some other general fund particular flavor is not specified now what we expected to be specified in that kind of a future year financial plan.,59,,
337,0.97,3942.972,3962.591,There is enough money to sustain the proposed budget with the caveat as well as make repayment installment payments to begin to bring the reserves back up to the $70 million range by the end of 24.,59,,
338,0.97,3962.591,3982.645,Dan Eder thank you because he Aly . would you like to Unmute?,60,,
339,0.97,3982.645,3986.482,You speaking to the Mayor's proposed budget and what is in the financial plan for Replenishing the reserves.,61,,
340,0.97,3986.482,4026.655,I just wanted to clarify because I think what you're asking was what was in the spending plan for the payroll expense tax regarding replenishment of the emergency fund in 2021 it gets complicated because the Jumpstart spending plan assumed that the Council that the spending plan for Covid relief in 2020 that was adopted was using $86 million from the emergency fund in 2020 that would then be paid back in 2021.,61,,
341,0.97,4026.655,4066.962,"In the first $86 million in 2021 to replenish the stabilization and and then after paying back that use, it would then be used in 2021 with the continuity of services and 20% for continue Covid really been 5% to implement an administrative payroll tax and begin to implement or set of the programs necessary to implement the spending plan investments proposed in 2022 and beyond.",61,,
342,0.97,4066.962,4144.707,"Ultimately through another revised ordinance that was adopted in September, 119860 the amount of funding from the emergency fund was reduced to $57 million and following that a compromise between the Mayor and Council that reduced the overall use of the emergency Fnd for Covid relief to $45 million spreading out over 2020 and 2021 and there is legislation that was transmitted with the budget to repeal Council boil and replace it with a bill that reflects the proposed use from the emergency fund in 2020 and it is in the proposed budget so to be most accurate or aligned with the adopted spending plan for the payroll tax, what we would have expected to see what have been Replenishing leaving $40 million in emergency in the emergency fund paying back the $20 million used in 2020 and not drying the $20 million needed for the compromise and 2021. it could've been paid out of the payroll tax revenues.",61,,
343,0.97,4144.707,4154.95,$130 million for continuity of services for continue Covid relief and about $8.5 million for the administration.,61,,
344,0.97,4154.95,4172.835,I will notice during these conversations director noble from the budget Office said more than once that he was expecting to need to make use of the reserves in 2020 so even if they were replenished there would be used again.,61,,
345,0.97,4172.835,4197.459,"Tom just reflected that at least some money could've gone back into the emergency fund have there been different spending choices made there is a lot of competing policy choices here right now, so it is good to note that the expectation was that in 2021 Usana replenishment of the funds and at least those that were used in 2020 for Covid relief.",61,,
346,0.97,4197.459,4198.46,Thank you very much.,62,,
347,0.97,4198.46,4202.898,I will turn it over to Councilmember Morales.,62,,
348,0.97,4202.898,4203.332,Please go ahead.,62,,
349,0.97,4203.332,4212.808,"Thank you . Thank you for this presentation and memo, Tom.",63,,
350,0.97,4212.808,4216.979,It is really helpful to help us walk through what is going on here . sorry.,63,,
351,0.97,4216.979,4218.18,I do not remember which slide.,63,,
352,0.97,4218.18,4231.894,I have questions about the strategic investment fund.,63,,
353,0.97,4231.894,4247.743,"Was not here when that happened, but I recall following the conversation particularly because as I recall the funds were intended to be used for the equitable development initiative permanent affordable housing.",63,,
354,0.97,4247.743,4251.58,The kind of community investments that we have been talking about since I have been here.,63,,
355,0.97,4251.58,4273.135,And so I just wanted to kind of unpack that little bit and make sure that I'm understanding what that was intended to be used for and I believe I just heard you say that the process was to create an interdepartmental team to make decisions about how those resources would be allocated.,63,,
356,0.97,4273.135,4274.303,Is that right?,63,,
357,0.97,4274.303,4281.944,"Yes, Councilmember Morales.",64,,
358,0.97,4281.944,4282.544,That is correct.,64,,
359,0.97,4282.544,4299.728,"Aly might have additional information to add to the team was formed and there was perhaps a couple meetings earlier this fiscal year and then Covid hit and I believe the process was installed at that point, given the Covid crisis.",64,,
360,0.97,4299.728,4329.191,"So that is the status . I think your description of the investments and the intent is accurate, but that is essentially the status of that money right now and what was for and how the team was started but have not finished with that work.",64,,
361,0.97,4329.191,4329.591,Okay.,65,,
362,0.97,4329.591,4344.707,So there was a process started with a department forum and was funded to make these investments and that is now removed from this budget proposal.,65,,
363,0.97,4344.707,4347.976,"If I could just add in, Councilmember Morales, I believe there was internal meetings formed.",66,,
364,0.97,4347.976,4386.448,"I also understand that there were a few meetings with Stakeholders to begin the process of developing the criteria . I do not know if the official term is Stakeholder advisory group or how formal it was, but I believe that there was some work with Stakeholders to start thinking about the criteria and how decisions might be made but as Tom mentioned as far as we know the sort of stalled out likely due to Covid and other emergencies and would use it for balancing 2020.",66,,
365,0.97,4386.448,4386.749,Okay.,67,,
366,0.97,4386.749,4392.321,Thank you,67,,
367,0.97,4392.321,4394.556,"Just as an editorial note, not everything has stalled out.",68,,
368,0.97,4394.556,4419.081,We have figured out ways to the leadership of Councilmember Strauss to make sure that planning Commission for meetings can continue to come forward and people can participate in those discussions we've been able to solicit public input on record numbers here.,68,,
369,0.97,4419.081,4423.685,I think it is important to note that there is other ways in which public input and community feedback could be received.,68,,
370,0.97,4423.685,4425.12,"It is an important question, Councilmember Morales.",68,,
371,0.97,4425.12,4447.376,Is on my list of questions also and in the memo it says an explanation of the strategic investment fund financed by the sale of the Mercer block was for areas of high risk of displacement and/or economic disadvantage communities.,68,,
372,0.97,4447.376,4473.435,That is an important question for us to figure out what is the impact of a $30 million cut in this area and will remain for the otherwise promising areas for the investments that people had really rallied to support elements of the Mercer sale because that was the component of the final product.,68,,
373,0.97,4473.435,4479.141,"In the final comments on that, Councilmember Morales?",68,,
374,0.97,4479.141,4523.352,"I think it bears repeating the irony here of cutting funds for a program dedicated already to equitable investment and the purpose of this was for Transformative equitable development inner-city, specifically highlighting areas as you said at highest risk of displacement . I just think it is ironic that the program is now cut so that we can find a new program with a new process to make new kinds of investments around a portable development program will say more later.",69,,
375,0.97,4523.352,4527.589,I am just struggling to understand the logic here.,69,,
376,0.97,4527.589,4529.658,"Please take it away, Councilmember Sawant.",70,,
377,0.97,4529.658,4553.916,"Thank you . First just to reiterate the point that has been made by Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Mosqueda, we should not accept that this is in some way that Covid is to blame for the $30 million cut.",71,,
378,0.97,4553.916,4558.02,I certainly do not accept that.,71,,
379,0.97,4558.02,4576.638,On the bucket of money was called for the strategic investment fund I think it was designed to mean nothing and that it is easy to then hide the cuts in the third-quarter supplemental budget which is what the Mayor has done.,71,,
380,0.97,4576.638,4595.624,That is very different from the language used during the last year budget when she said she was creating this Fund and would work to invest the 30 min dollars to address displacement in black and Brown communities.,71,,
381,0.97,4595.624,4619.181,"To put a fine point on it, she talked about these $30 million last year exactly the same way she was talking about the $100 million this year but not one penny has been seen by the community . I of course agree with the point that have been made that on everything has stalled so has this stalled?",71,,
382,0.97,4619.181,4622.184,And so much as unfounded or underfunded and the marginalized communities.,71,,
383,0.97,4622.184,4639.301,That really is impossible for the Mayor's office to figure out what needs to be funded because so much needs to be funded?,71,,
384,0.97,4639.301,4642.771,I can think of 15 different ways in which Tuesday $30 million and it would benefit the community.,71,,
385,0.97,4642.771,4659.454,And so to say that for the Mayor's office to say that we cannot do this because we cannot have this process anymore it's just not a plausible excuse . There is no mystery about what needs to be funded.,71,,
386,0.97,4659.454,4660.622,A lot needs to be funded.,71,,
387,0.97,4660.622,4664.893,$30 million only go so far but it will make a difference for whatever that is used for.,71,,
388,0.97,4664.893,4684.446,I just wanted to say my worry is that the same approaches being used for this grant promise of $100 million.,71,,
389,0.97,4684.446,4690.318,One could say that we $100 million that is been proposed by the Mayor's been partially paid for by ignoring the promise of the $30 million made last year.,71,,
390,0.97,4690.318,4691.753,These are just numbers in the air.,71,,
391,0.97,4691.753,4703.065,The question is what is actually real and what is to stop from next her promising $150 million in on funding from this year and saying will be funding this year?,71,,
392,0.97,4703.065,4709.638,Every year to have the promises getting bigger without actually making a real investment.,71,,
393,0.97,4709.638,4733.061,"Also wanted to note that it is problematic that they attempted to hide this cut of the third- quarter supplemental budget, which is so rarely scrutinized for it is difficult for many people to get involved in the details of the city budget rather than just being honest about it.",71,,
394,0.97,4733.061,4745.974,I really appreciate the comments being made by Councilmembers about all this but I hope that the Council will support the form a from my office to eliminate this cut because it is important to our communities.,71,,
395,0.97,4745.974,4765.761,I find it quite I cannot take it at face value that the Mayor says that there will be progressive revenue stream to make this a permanent part.,71,,
396,0.97,4767.496,4768.764,What is this progressive revenue stream?,71,,
397,0.97,4768.764,4769.998,This is numbers in the air.,71,,
398,0.97,4769.998,4772.934,This is the Mayor that opposed the Amazon tax and every progressive revenue source.,71,,
399,0.97,4772.934,4775.704,I would not go to the bank with it.,71,,
400,0.97,4775.704,4785.213,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant any comments on that?",72,,
401,0.97,4785.213,4785.814,"Go ahead, Dan.",72,,
402,0.97,4785.814,4806.935,"I just wanted to point out that the 2020, as Tom had described, the position of the general fund at the end of 2020 materially affects the starting place for the 2021 budget.",73,,
403,0.97,4806.935,4845.907,"So Council could certainly take up the question about whether or not to eliminate the $30 million reserve for the District investments that were anticipated in 2020. if you were to wipe out that cut, which is to say restore the spending, he would have to reduce the amount of spending in 2021 because then there would be $30 million less money available to spend.",73,,
404,0.97,4845.907,4846.708,You could do that.,73,,
405,0.97,4846.708,4856.918,Is just an illustration about what would be available to you one of things you can do is reduce it down to $70 million.,73,,
406,0.97,4856.918,4863.225,I think in fact it does reflect what we are talking about with the Mayor's proposal.,73,,
407,0.97,4863.225,4879.14,She had $30 million for a similar purpose that she is now saying is no longer proposed in 2020 proposed $100 million in 2021 for a similar purpose but a large amount of money.,73,,
408,0.97,4879.14,4884.846,$70 million of new spending for the similar purpose.,73,,
409,0.97,4884.846,4885.847,Thank you very match.,74,,
410,0.97,4885.847,4902.731,I want to thank all of you especially for these questions as opposed to the third-quarter and the Finance general chapter for the 2020 budget as was just mentioned.,74,,
411,0.97,4902.731,4909.371,It is where we have the chance to look at these level details during the year providing us with that analysis so that we know where the starting point is.,74,,
412,0.97,4909.371,4916.745,It is really important.,74,,
413,0.97,4916.745,4933.361,I know with the conversation we just had it just summarizes the pieces to address displacement in the 2020 quarter three supplemental discussion a little very soon.,74,,
414,0.97,4935.53,4965.627,"These are baked into what they had put forward from the proposed budget that was sent down that we are reading the rationale for why the dollars were taken based on the language that came from the Mayor's office . I think all of the points very well said and I want to thank all of you for highlighting those pieces and helping us understand what the rational was according to the Mayor's office . one more question, Tom, if I might.",74,,
415,0.97,4965.627,4968.73,On one of your first slides in the we will get into the issue Id.,74,,
416,0.97,4968.73,4994.356,We have the $13 million hole question . I believe that was on slide three . can help us understand a little bit about the $13 million hold here and how this relates to the purposes of the Interfund loan that Council had passed earlier this summer?,74,,
417,0.97,4994.356,5004.199,Sure . I would be happy to the prior slide might be more informative to get to this number.,75,,
418,0.97,5004.199,5017.011,This is the high-level Recap where the Council has been with regards to adjusting to the Covid crisis.,75,,
419,0.97,5017.011,5031.292,"And then there is the proposed final measure so quarter three as we have just discussed and and some additional Measures., all of these adjustments, the balance issue is $4.9 million.",75,,
420,0.97,5031.292,5046.307,The reason for that number so that is positive.,75,,
421,0.97,5046.307,5049.778,The budget in 2021 relies on $18 million is the starting point.,75,,
422,0.97,5049.778,5082.31,That is generated by not doing the Interfund loan in 2020. so doing the community safety investments that are in Council bill 119285 and human services and doing those adjustments are shown from the deputy Mayor send on September 30 and doing investments but the September 30 letter said not doing the Interfund loan so therefore no revenue to support those investments.,75,,
423,0.97,5082.31,5107.869,That essentially is the issue that will be covered in issue identification because it is a critical thing there is a 13 window shortfall if no action is taken and that is our essential starting point for all other issues aside we have a $13 million shortfall in the proposed budget.,75,,
424,0.97,5107.869,5154.916,"Chair Mosqueda, I agree with all of what Tom said . I think it may be useful to note that the practical reality of printing up the budget and making some final decisions on what was going to be proposed that we are now discussing had some introduced some necessity for the city budget office and the Mayor to make some assumptions about what was going to be overridden when overridden in 119825.",76,,
425,0.97,5154.916,5176.571,I think they may have assumed they had to go one way or the other and I think they assumed that the spending included in part of the summer revisions suite of legislation was going to be sustained.,76,,
426,0.97,5176.571,5191.419,That is part of why the proposed budget doesn't perfectly marry up with what we now see is the reality of what is happening in 2020 and how it affects 2021.,76,,
427,0.97,5191.419,5205.066,Thank you . Thank you very match for the summary on the 13 million question.,77,,
428,0.97,5205.066,5205.867,I see more questions.,77,,
429,0.97,5205.867,5210.772,"Tom, thank you for letting us pause and if you like to continue with the rest of your slides, that would be great.",77,,
430,0.97,5210.772,5212.44,I believe the next slide.,78,,
431,0.97,5212.44,5243.905,"Esentially we identified six issues through the memo in the presentation . They have different implications and of course different ways to address them that would be product the work for the next month if we go to the next slide, this is on the range of issues . a fairly minor issue.",78,,
432,0.97,5243.905,5263.891,"Wanting to raise this is a topic for Council to be aware of at a minimum . As discussed in the memo, the Rebalance of the current fiscal year that we are in relies on $11 million of administrative understand balance.",78,,
433,0.97,5263.891,5272.634,This is essentially the executive departments and they will spend less than what is approved in the ordinance's.,78,,
434,0.97,5272.634,5287.348,There has been a significant amount of work that has been done and proposed to bring the budget in balance with a significant Covid talent and then essentially this is the last piece.,78,,
435,0.97,5287.348,5302.196,We raise it because it is a unique exercise that we are in of digesting a spending plan through appropriations to a new reality and a significant amount of work has been done.,78,,
436,0.97,5302.196,5318.179,"Normally if we were looking at the proposed budget for next year, as we are doing, there is always be some and to spend assumption in what the Department submits.",78,,
437,0.97,5318.179,5338.9,This is not out of the ordinary that there would be some small piece practices 1% of the total smaller adjusted $1.2 million amount of revenue that we have.,78,,
438,0.97,5338.9,5340.635,It is essentially that small balancing peace.,78,,
439,0.97,5340.635,5353.247,It is by way of sensual staff communicating that to Council although staff is comfortable with the assumptions that information provided to demonstrate how the budget will be balanced.,78,,
440,0.97,5353.247,5355.817,The state law only requires that Council adopt a budget balance.,78,,
441,0.97,5355.817,5363.825,There is no requirement that through adjustments to the remainder of the fiscal year at that requirement to be met.,78,,
442,0.97,5363.825,5398.826,"That is a standard that must be met by the pure essential of the executive branch will not be able to spend more cash than is available in the fund are just bringing forward the issue for full disclosure, not highlighting it is a major concern that needs to be addressed although it is always an option to take any one of these courses of action that are detailed for you.",78,,
443,0.97,5400.528,5402.43,This is the topic that has received some discussion.,78,,
444,0.97,5402.43,5455.383,"This is the proposal to basically reduce the strategic investment fund appropriation 20 from $30 million in order to balance the budget and the options are to do some other alternative to that assumption; however, as I believe Dan mentioned not doing this would require $30 million to be identified in the 2020 budget balance . We are in October so the ability to adjust to that reality would refer to that and would require some element of using reserves as we have discussed also plays a role in 2021.",78,,
445,0.97,5455.383,5467.762,And there would need to be some adjustment to the 2021 spending proposal in order to balance it out.,78,,
446,0.97,5467.762,5480.241,Another alternative is to take no action . the next issue to identify this is the ending balance which we just touched on.,78,,
447,0.97,5480.241,5488.85,"It is fairly clear . If not, please ask further questions.",78,,
448,0.97,5488.85,5535.796,"Based on the information that I relayed and the helpful additional information from Dan about why that was a talent in order to built into the budget, we are faced with the $11 million or 2020 ending balance being $13 million our than what was expected . So again, could identify other cuts and this year or could identify cuts for new revenue in 2021 to address the . No action is potentially not action because we are faced with a $13 million shortfall.",78,,
449,0.97,5535.796,5545.406,"Next slide, please?",78,,
450,0.97,5545.406,5556.183,This would Reverences back to the structure of showing how we started with the baseline budget and then there was cuts that were added that were proposed by the Mayor.,78,,
451,0.97,5556.183,5584.912,And that reduction $27 million addressing the Covid implementation cost and the payroll tax and limitation and the Covid emergency cost and then identify and that there was still a positive amount prior to the initiative of $27 million . The payroll expense tax did have a dedication toward continuity of service.,78,,
452,0.97,5584.912,5599.86,The could be alternatives identified to address these 27 Million-Dollar reductions either through identify new revenues reducing some other element of the budget or no action is also of course.,78,,
453,0.97,5599.86,5628.689,And then a key point of consideration we talked about in great depth as there is her balance and how the proposal takes us from a starting balance of 78.9 million in 2021 and and ending months of $6 million in fully understanding that that leaves little in the savings account to address emergencies beyond that period.,78,,
454,0.97,5628.689,5657.618,The options would be to reduce the use of reserves by way of identifying a new revenue source or other cuts in order to get closer to or retain the full amount of the proposed starting balance . and then I believe the next slide is essentially a corollary of the $13 million.,78,,
455,0.97,5657.618,5664.425,It will be addressed in either 2024 to be addressed in 2021.,78,,
456,0.97,5664.425,5668.329,But it is a key piece of the financing plan for their assumptions about which year that is resolved.,78,,
457,0.97,5668.329,5677.571,And I believe those are the key issues from the high-level financing analysis.,78,,
458,0.97,5677.571,5684.412,Maybe Aly was going to cover this part.,78,,
459,0.97,5684.412,5695.856,This is the high-level we will look into issue 80 for the departments tomorrow and then through the 21st.,78,,
460,0.97,5695.856,5707.435,Thank you so much for the Walk-Through of this presentation and for the way in which you have made these slides digestible for us and members of the public it is appreciated.,79,,
461,0.97,5707.435,5709.27,I believe Councilmember Strauss is the first question.,79,,
462,0.97,5709.27,5730.191,"Thank you, chairman Mosqueda and also Tom Becky provided the different options regarding the $13 million shortfall.",80,,
463,0.97,5730.191,5737.098,"If we were to reauthorize the loan, is there any guarantee it would be executed by the Mayor?",80,,
464,0.97,5737.098,5737.765,"Councilmember Strauss, no.",81,,
465,0.97,5737.765,5779.807,"It could be essentially it is its own discrete new auction they would have to identify so you have to go through I believe the loan was proposed in 2020 was from the construction inspection would have to go through the exercise of finding where there would be cash in the city coffers that could support this type of loan, and then will be the interaction with the executive as to whether or not that is reasonable and whether or not they would support that.",81,,
466,0.97,5779.807,5780.841,It is not clear.,81,,
467,0.97,5780.841,5783.911,It is an option that could be pursued.,81,,
468,0.97,5783.911,5790.651,Understanding that eventually there would need to be a repayment identified.,81,,
469,0.97,5790.651,5802.53,"And I just wanted to add if I could and if I may, to the comment from Councilmember Herbold about the Digestibility of the slides.",81,,
470,0.97,5802.53,5810.971,A big shout out to lise Kaye who helped us greatly in terms of making these slides to an air.,81,,
471,0.97,5810.971,5819.146,I agree . They came across as helpful and fairly descriptive in terms of the information.,81,,
472,0.97,5819.146,5829.657,Thank you to lise for that.,81,,
473,0.97,5830.024,5830.591,Thank you.,82,,
474,0.97,5830.591,5833.294,"Aly, I saw you as well coming off of mute.",82,,
475,0.97,5833.294,5834.295,It was by accident.,83,,
476,0.97,5834.295,5834.695,Thank you.,83,,
477,0.97,5834.695,5847.474,"Thank you, lise and thank you to the folks in the communications shop.",84,,
478,0.97,5847.474,5881.242,Now that Joseph has been working hard as well with the images and the data provided to provide a quick summary slide that will be posted on our Council social media accounts to see them in real time and the calculation change right before your eyes . I want to say thank you as well to the communications team for the work to take the good work they want done on these slides and translate that into a Shareable image that we can get out to the public.,84,,
479,0.97,5881.242,5881.642,Other comments?,84,,
480,0.97,5881.642,5885.012,"Please go ahead, Councilmember Morales.",84,,
481,0.97,5885.012,5885.346,Yes.,85,,
482,0.97,5885.346,5912.172,"Tom, I am looking at the last page about Sustainability and I wonder if we could just go there for a couple minutes . You Referenced a five-year financial plan and the proposed budget and toward the end you talk about some embedded assumptions that are included.",85,,
483,0.97,5912.172,5953.714,"I am just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you think some of those Assumptins might be because what you are indicating here is that new revenue is added to the general Fund, but projections of future balancing do not include investments in the things that we had passed in the resolution are Jumpstarted in particular . I just wonder if you could talk a little bit from your perspective what the five-year plan says about Sustainability of the proposed budget.",85,,
484,0.97,5953.714,5954.114,Yes.,86,,
485,0.97,5954.114,5954.548,Of course.,86,,
486,0.97,5954.548,5966.126,"Thank you for the question, Councilmember Morales the intent of describing this piece in Sustainability is to share three critical concepts.",86,,
487,0.97,5966.126,5981.342,One is that the budget that is been discussed right now in 2021 includes the full measure of the payroll expense tax.,86,,
488,0.97,5981.342,6002.896,"It starts in $240 million in 2021 and it grows up to $265 million by 2024, based on the assumptions used by CBO for the plan.",86,,
489,0.97,6003.597,6004.932,That is baked into the plan.,86,,
490,0.97,6004.932,6009.57,Is also further suggesting that the 2021 proposed budget has a $100 million for the equitable communities initiative in the budget proposal in 2021.,86,,
491,0.97,6009.57,6016.977,That amount is included in future years as part of the forecast that they have given.,86,,
492,0.97,6016.977,6041.402,"The decision about 2022 spending and beyond not really a discussion that is taking place right now, although to signify that is included at $100 million and then there is $100 million that grows are actually believe it stays at $100 million.",86,,
493,0.97,6041.402,6063.29,Every year thereafter . The budget book says equitable communities is an ongoing investment that has been subsequent medication the progressive revenue sources will be identified in the future.,86,,
494,0.97,6063.29,6070.697,Those new sources are not part of this plan so the assumption is a $100 million investment will be paid from general fund revenues of which the new payroll expense tax is one of those pieces.,86,,
495,0.97,6070.697,6102.463,The third key take away is the way that the the financial one is built is it takes the 20 Councilmember budget and grows it by inflation or different assumptions about how health insurance is going to grow things like that just a set of Standard assumptions that is assumed also drawn from General revenues in which the Parol expense tax is one piece.,86,,
496,0.97,6102.463,6129.99,The key piece that I'm trying to highlight is that the payroll expense tax as Councilmember Herbold mentioned has a spending resolution that indicates that in 2022 and beyond their significantly different investments that are in the proposed 2021 budget.,86,,
497,0.97,6129.99,6131.391,That is the point of distinction.,86,,
498,0.97,6131.391,6160.721,"The Council is not adopting a 2020 budget right now, though it is making clear how the revenue is been assumed to be programmed in the future and how that may vary or does vary and a resolution spending . I hope that helps explain and in that context of what I was trying to indicate.",86,,
499,0.97,6160.721,6161.388,Thank you.,87,,
500,0.97,6161.388,6188.215,"I appreciate that 52 points I'm getting from that as somebody who advocated strongly for the $20 million in funding and the green new deal funding and Jumpstart I think that is important to remember and that there isn't really any revenue source identified after the first four years of the equitable community's initiative, and so we just need to shine some light on that.",87,,
501,0.97,6188.215,6190.651,Thank you.,87,,
502,0.97,6190.651,6207.501,"Other questions on the presentation, the memo that we have in front of us right now?",88,,
503,0.97,6208.302,6208.535,Okay.,88,,
504,0.97,6208.535,6214.041,I'm not seen any additional questions at this moment but if we want to spend any time going through the second memo regarding quarter three?,88,,
505,0.97,6214.041,6240.867,"Chairman Mosqueda, that was provided really for background . Most of the notable changes in the third-quarter supplemental were either just covered by Tom, the $30 million piece specifically, and other notable changes to be highlighted in the discussions coming up in committee over the next week or so.",89,,
506,0.97,6240.867,6245.906,"Lise Kaye is on the line if anyone has a question about those materials, but that was provided for your reference.",89,,
507,0.97,6245.906,6254.381,"Thank you for popping in, lise.",90,,
508,0.97,6254.381,6264.224,Thank you for the work that you and Tom have done individuals and thank you as well for your memo . I do not see any additional questions.,90,,
509,0.97,6264.224,6268.528,This will not be the last time.,90,,
510,0.97,6268.528,6290.751,"This is the first opportunity for us to Digest and pull some of the layers back . This will be the foundation for which were able to ask additional questions, think about additional priorities, ask about possible investments and stability of what needs to be the Balanced-Budget that was sent back.",90,,
511,0.97,6290.751,6291.952,And seen in questions wonderful.,90,,
512,0.97,6291.952,6310.07,We will go head and move on to item 3 on our agenda and we will say thank you as well one more time to the central staff team.,90,,
513,0.97,6310.07,6311.672,"Madame clerk, could you read item number three?",90,,
514,0.97,6311.672,6314.641,Agenda item 3. discussion on select budget committee presentation for breathing and discussion.,91,,
515,0.97,6314.641,6315.342,Thank you.,92,,
516,0.97,6315.342,6319.78,"I will note that this is an unusual year, as we have talked about.",92,,
517,0.97,6319.78,6358.518,"This is an opportunity for us to all be removed to be explicit and transparent in our deliberations for the public, members of the press, and city employees and in a partnership with the executive as we tried to come up with a balanced budget we endeavor to have these conversations in a public manner so that the public can see where we are at and everything from these discussions to our desires to understand more about the revenue streams and the impact on the reserve.",92,,
518,0.97,6358.518,6367.527,This is an important discussion that we have had today and what I built into the budget for the next is an opportunity for us to have a dialogue.,92,,
519,0.97,6367.527,6431.758,We do not get to see each other in person and what I would like to use this this is a chance to open up the floor to just get any national feedback and any thoughts and questions that you all have had some initial thoughts that I would be looking at related to fiscal responsibility in the budget and the impact on short-term and long-term a lot of questions about the use of the revenue from the Jumpstart payroll tax and then ultimately were the cell leads is whether or not there is cuts or potential investment priorities and how this affects where we all had put them on the scale in the 2020 book balance package and what implications this proposed budget has for those priorities in the 2021 budget.,92,,
520,0.97,6431.758,6447.507,I'm really encouraging us to share any feedback and thoughts that we had from the presentation received from central staff.,92,,
521,0.97,6447.507,6457.717,"I'm happy to have a Roundtable discussion as we close out this first day in our four day analysis of the proposed budget that comes in front of us because your thoughts, questions, and feedback will help us to have a more robust discussion over the next few days and weeks.",92,,
522,0.97,6457.717,6468.628,"With that, I am happy to open up with some initial thoughts.",92,,
523,0.97,6468.628,6471.531,I know Councilmember Morales indicated you would like to have some comments as well.,92,,
524,0.97,6471.531,6473.533,On the other Councilmembers feel free to let me know.,92,,
525,0.97,6473.533,6475.335,"I see you as well, Councilmember Pedersen.",92,,
526,0.97,6475.335,6476.77,I will get you in the Queue here.,92,,
527,0.97,6476.77,6498.925,One of the first things that came to mind looking at this budget is remembering that usually have a two-year budget process.,92,,
528,0.97,6498.925,6501.862,This year we all agreed given the uncertain financial situation to just do one year.,92,,
529,0.97,6501.862,6517.944,"As Tom mentioned today and also in the memo, it will be imperative for us to think that just as a two-year budget process but in the years out on how the proposed use of revenue and reserves would impact any √öfuture downturn in the economy I would hate for us to be Mid- 2021 and have the next Iteration compounded with the extreme flute impact future ability for us to maintain stable services for those in the community.",92,,
530,0.97,6517.944,6518.578,Especially our most Moldable.,92,,
531,0.97,6518.578,6556.116,I will be looking to make sure we are prepared for economic downturn and potential worsening into next year and making sure we have a sufficient cushion so to say so that we can prevent us from being in a scrambling vote next year but also making sure we are putting down significant investments to provide the type of layoffs and reductions that we knew we wanted to listen given the revenue that we have from Jumpstart payroll tax.,92,,
532,0.97,6556.116,6584.578,"Know that this is going to be a tough conversation, but I think it is important for us to explore the balance of making sure there is a cushions we do not create further harm to both core government services and the Rollerball communities that we aim to serve . It will be a disservice if we do not have the revenue that we need in the next year or the future to rely on in case something else happens.",92,,
533,0.97,6584.578,6588.715,"Related to Jumpstart, I am worried about the budgetary layoffs and resulting city service gaps that the Council intended to curb.",92,,
534,0.97,6588.715,6609.903,"So in addition to what I just mentioned some other things that I'm interested in looking at is making sure the most vulnerable residents in Seattle get the funding that they need as we really intended for some of the most Moldable including immigrants and refugees, our smallest businesses, those living in unstable housing situations, and investing there.",92,,
535,0.97,6609.903,6613.94,I look forward to hearing from all of you about what your thoughts are about the use of that funds.,92,,
536,0.97,6613.94,6633.793,And the concerns or issues about the impact of contracts either funded or left unfunded in 2021 as we had originally intended to invest in in the payroll tax proposal?,92,,
537,0.97,6633.793,6654.014,"And with that, I will just say one of the biggest issues that I know we are concerned with as we look at this budget through the lens of how to we create healthy, safe opportunities for community members in the city of Seattle we know that there needs to be a tremendous amount of investment into making sure that there is shelters and rooms to move people into.",92,,
538,0.97,6654.014,6688.715,"As I mentioned, they had created this great trusting relationship with the gentleman who needed assistance but cannot get a shelter on the phone and they had welcomed him in with open arms and created a reciprocal relationship where he didn't trust.",92,,
539,0.97,6688.715,6692.652,He was willing to go to the shelter and they were just at capacity so there was no place.,92,,
540,0.97,6692.652,6720.013,Thank goodness the King County team came in and was able to sort of have a warm hand off there and keep working on but we have to think about that exit plan for those currently in shelters so shelters do not remain at capacity think that is one of my biggest interest of how we are creating the longer-term investment opening shelter opportunities so that we can be responsive in this moment of Covid but also a place for folks to go . We saw the rates of homelessness continuing to increase mobile for the Council took upon the conversations around the navigation team.,92,,
541,0.97,6720.013,6741.101,The crisis of Covid and the instability in our local economy and the cost of housing continues to rise day after day a Seattle housing market is just skyrocketing the cost of housing and only is extremely expensive.,92,,
542,0.97,6741.101,6743.136,All of these issues were here prior to the summer discussion.,92,,
543,0.97,6743.136,6753.313,We have to think about how this budget is calling us to act to create a light at the end of the tunnel so folks can either get into a shelter if they are not currently or out of shelter and into housing so that they do not circle back.,92,,
544,0.97,6753.313,6770.396,These are some of the issues that are still a concern to me and look forward to Red with all of you soaking forward to hearing more from you about what you been hearing from Stakeholders as he had been out in the community.,92,,
545,0.97,6770.396,6778.905,That is one of the biggest one coming up in my conversations and where you are hearing from Stakeholders about what their biggest concerns are in the initial discussions that we've had so far on whether hope and will continue to invest.,92,,
546,0.97,6778.905,6783.143,Those are some of the initial is ahead on it will turn over to Councilmember Morales and then Councilmember Pedersen.,92,,
547,0.97,6783.143,6792.085,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",93,,
548,0.97,6792.085,6798.224,I want to thank central staff for the work that They'Redoing to help us to understand this and look through the proposed budget and present things with such clarity.,93,,
549,0.97,6798.224,6804.831,We hear over and over again that government budgets are moral documents.,93,,
550,0.97,6804.831,6815.074,I think this is never been more true for me than hearing what we have been hearing today.,93,,
551,0.97,6815.074,6826.786,I think our community deserves a really Transparen and honest analysis about where we are as a city park especially in a health crisis and fiscal crisis.,93,,
552,0.97,6826.786,6841.501,I will admit that I am frustrated.,93,,
553,0.97,6841.501,6843.703,I am sure that has come out in my questions already.,93,,
554,0.97,6843.703,6918.278,"I think the constituents of the Mayor of mine also in our constituents and the city really deserves a greater transparency in how we are talking about the Decisios and the kind of ways that we are thinking about structuring our budget on structuring the kind of investments that we want to make . so for me as a listening to central staff, a couple things really popped off the page for me . Some might say that this is an Aspirational budget that is been proposed painting a picture of generous community investments funded by new revenue sources, which this Council but really hard for . I also think another perception might be that this budget is a bit of a Shell game because it relies on spending Jumpstart revenue, which we've already spent and committed to Covid really for next year and because it drains emergency reserves to a dangerously low level . I fear that that is a fairly reckless approach.",93,,
555,0.97,6918.278,6921.347,Especially when we have so many compounding crises still at hand in the city.,93,,
556,0.97,6921.347,6941.768,I do not think anybody could've predicted a 100 year pandemic that we have seen that we have lost lives and businesses and jobs in this city we still have the Covid crisis.,93,,
557,0.97,6941.768,6947.807,"To drain our emergency management Fund from 66,000,060 6000 without any plan for paying that money back is to really gamble with the lives of our neighbors.",93,,
558,0.97,6947.807,6949.309,I think that is fiscally irresponsible.,93,,
559,0.97,6949.309,6950.576,I think it is downright dangerous.,93,,
560,0.97,6950.576,6957.483,The other issue for me is really just the Illogic of the budget.,93,,
561,0.97,6957.483,6974.834,This summer the Mayor made a commitment of $100 million a year investment in black communities for 10 years and recently announced a credible community tells Chris to make decisions about how to spend the money.,93,,
562,0.97,6974.834,6980.907,But she is proposing to pay for the with funds from critical reserves that serve as an umbrella for rainy day.,93,,
563,0.97,6980.907,7001.661,"The Illogic of this does not begin with the 2021 budget but starts with the remainder of the 2020 budget leaving us in the Red because of the third- quarter supplemental that solves our deficit by zeroing out the $30 million strategic investment fund, as we have learned.",93,,
564,0.97,7001.661,7026.452,"A fund that was dedicated to things like permanent affordable housing, land acquisition and areas at high risk of displacement . It is no secret that this is a really critical tool particularly for folks in the South end closing the greatest displacement in the city.",93,,
565,0.97,7026.452,7049.976,I just want to make clear that already created the team and some entity already funded the process.,93,,
566,0.97,7049.976,7054.814,Now that is being cut and a new process is beginning with a new team for making new decisions.,93,,
567,0.97,7054.814,7057.083,So I'm just confused about that process.,93,,
568,0.97,7057.083,7071.898,"On top of that, rather than holding to the 10 year commitment, the executives directing this new task force to find a new source of funding, in four years.",93,,
569,0.97,7071.898,7081.24,"As our central staff memo indicates, there is the hundred million dollars level anticipated to be ongoing annual investments.",93,,
570,0.97,7081.24,7085.845,But the financial plan includes funding only through 2024.,93,,
571,0.97,7085.845,7112.872,"So, I'm just, really struggling with, what the thinking is about how we make these investments, make these commitments, especially when we have a Covid-19 sized crisis, a Covid-19 sized hole in the budget . We need to work to build a budget that's sustainable and a budget that is realistic.",93,,
572,0.97,7112.872,7118.811,This counsel Deliberated for months to take measures that avoid austerity.,93,,
573,0.97,7118.811,7125.685,"I think we are all still committed to that, we want to preserve, services for our most vulnerable.",93,,
574,0.97,7125.685,7137.997,"And in the end, invest in new ways that will begin to address the history of racist policies and practices in the city.",93,,
575,0.97,7137.997,7139.765,And we have to be realistic about that.,93,,
576,0.97,7139.765,7141.234,About what we can achieve in a pandemic.,93,,
577,0.97,7141.234,7146.005,"And equally important, what we can and cannot afford to do.",93,,
578,0.97,7146.005,7151.11,I would like nothing more than to invest $100 million in black communities.,93,,
579,0.97,7151.11,7161.487,But I will strongly urge my colleagues to look at the Sbd budget and commit again to the development and investment strategy that we already talked about.,93,,
580,0.97,7161.487,7165.525,We may not find $100 million.,93,,
581,0.97,7165.525,7166.392,To make those commitments.,93,,
582,0.97,7166.392,7180.339,"But we can't sacrifice the fiscal stability of our city, and we can't provide vital coded relief, if we are going to follow the path that is set forth in the proposed budget.",93,,
583,0.97,7180.339,7185.444,I'm really concerned that the Mayor has written a check she can't cash.,93,,
584,0.97,7185.444,7192.151,"I really think it's important to level with our neighbors, and that she admit this might not be something we can do.",93,,
585,0.97,7192.151,7209.869,"And I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to make sure that we are putting forth a budget that serves, continues to serve the most vulnerable in our community and continues to move forward in a way that is much more sustainable than what we are seeing.",93,,
586,0.97,7209.869,7213.673,Thank you Councilmember morale us.,94,,
587,0.97,7213.673,7223.049,"I look forward to, Councilmember Peterson, I love all of the comments that you brought in this year.",94,,
588,0.97,7223.049,7231.49,"As you bring in this perspective on sort of, you know, long-term thinking and fiscal Sustainability.",94,,
589,0.97,7231.49,7248.007,I'm looking forward to hearing more of your thoughts on any pieces but I know that's been an issue area that you have been very poised in bringing up so I appreciate the conversation there and any other thoughts that you may have.,94,,
590,0.97,7248.007,7258.718,"Thank you, I want to echo the thanks to our city council staff and all the hard work trying to Digest all the ideas and comments that we provide.",95,,
591,0.97,7258.718,7270.63,"I appreciate, you're going on that health one right along and talking about how we can expand the health one program with firefighters and social workers.",95,,
592,0.97,7270.63,7280.539,"So in the forward thinking that we do need to think about, the year 2022, as well as what's in front of us now for 2021.",95,,
593,0.97,7280.539,7290.716,And one of the great things about the Jumpstart spending plan in 2022 is the focus on permanent housing.,95,,
594,0.97,7290.716,7306.832,"Considering all the crises we are facing including back to back deficits, for 2020 this year, and the next year, I believe the Mayor and her team have actually put forward a budget that is thoughtful and reasonable.",95,,
595,0.97,7306.899,7316.575,Do hope my colleagues do consider it in a collaborative tips--and constructive manner.,95,,
596,0.97,7316.575,7323.182,I'm pleased we have laws on the books that govern how we rebuild our rainy day Reserve funds over time.,95,,
597,0.97,7323.182,7330.69,"There were calculations where we put away money, I would love to look at strengthening that.",95,,
598,0.97,7330.69,7335.594,It sounds like there might be some common ground looking at how to strengthen that.,95,,
599,0.97,7335.594,7341.067,So that we are stocking more money each year to build up that reserve fund faster.,95,,
600,0.97,7341.067,7357.717,"But you know, if now is not time to deploy the rainy day funds with the global pandemic and back to back deficits, I can't really imagine a time when we would do that so, I think this is an appropriate time to do this.",95,,
601,0.97,7357.717,7360.986,However I'd like to look at how we build it back up faster in the future.,95,,
602,0.97,7360.986,7371.931,"One critique I have about the budget, that is before us, that I would like to put on the table for discussion, over the next week or so is.",95,,
603,0.97,7371.931,7383.109,Whether we really want to increase salaries by $42 million on top of the pay RAISES received by city government employees this year and last year.,95,,
604,0.97,7383.109,7393.886,"When so many people are out of jobs and our city has such deep needs, I personally don't think it's the right time to increase the pay of city government employees again.",95,,
605,0.97,7393.886,7411.17,"If you look at page 28 on tomorrow's miscellaneous issues memo, it's kind of buried in there, you will see a range of options, to save anywhere between 15 million and 42 million dollars simply by Forgoing those pay increases next year.",95,,
606,0.97,7411.17,7423.149,I think we should reinvest those millions of dollars in pay RAISES to provide more shelter and mental health support for people experiencing health--homelessness.,95,,
607,0.97,7423.149,7431.056,I would like to reinvest the millions of dollars to further invest in communities.,95,,
608,0.97,7431.056,7443.202,Let's reinvest the millions of dollars of those pay RAISES to increase the safety of our cities aging bridges we have found are in sad condition with our audit of bridges throughout the city.,95,,
609,0.97,7443.202,7454.013,"I think we should look at how do we get more money out the door, to vulnerable populations and our aging infrastructure instead of putting more money into our own pockets.",95,,
610,0.97,7454.013,7464.023,"That's on the table, the research is done, and I know it can be controversial, what I want to put it out there . to provide space for that type of discussion, thank you.",95,,
611,0.97,7464.023,7469.428,Thank you Councilmember Peterson.,96,,
612,0.97,7469.428,7476.535,"I look forward to working with you on any of those policy changes, to make sure we are building back reserves.",96,,
613,0.97,7476.535,7484.643,Not specific even to this year and next but I like the idea of making sure there is stable revenue policies we can build on.,96,,
614,0.97,7484.643,7496.255,And it makes sense to look at those so we are prepared to for the next wave.,96,,
615,0.97,7496.255,7501.126,There can absolutely be another pandemic that's not in 100 years but maybe in 10 years or so so let's think of that.,96,,
616,0.97,7501.126,7502.561,Thank you for sharing that.,96,,
617,0.97,7502.561,7504.763,Any other thoughts?,96,,
618,0.97,7504.763,7506.966,Any thoughts that you will have?,96,,
619,0.97,7506.966,7509.969,Revenue?,96,,
620,0.97,7509.969,7512.705,Projection? long-term stability.,96,,
621,0.97,7512.705,7514.74,I'd love to hear your thoughts on the high level overview.,96,,
622,0.97,7514.74,7521.247,Any other thoughts on Jumpstart or cuts priorities?,96,,
623,0.97,7521.247,7524.45,Councilmember Strauss anything from you?,96,,
624,0.97,7524.45,7528.954,Thank you chairman.,97,,
625,0.97,7528.954,7534.86,"I would just like to take a moment to say, this presentation today was very enlightening for me.",97,,
626,0.97,7534.86,7547.806,"What I have seen, is that we have been criticized as a legislative body.",97,,
627,0.97,7547.806,7553.512,For many of the actions we see in the proposed budget.,97,,
628,0.97,7553.512,7556.949,It's not a criticism for any other elected officials are staff or the central budget office.,97,,
629,0.97,7556.949,7564.123,"Rather just pointing out policy, not politics must drive our decision-making.",97,,
630,0.97,7564.123,7570.029,"We as Council wanted to replace the rainy day funds almost immediately, and those funds being replenished are now delayed.",97,,
631,0.97,7570.029,7581.407,"We received a budget that is not balanced and as Rcw 35.32 a, requires us to adopt a balanced budget.",97,,
632,0.97,7581.407,7585.644,It's our job to make these changes and fixes.,97,,
633,0.97,7585.644,7599.058,"I find the majority of the 2021 balance, to be very beneficial, and there are a lot of great investments which have not been made in previous years by previous executives or councils.",97,,
634,0.97,7599.058,7608.367,I just want to take a moment to state that what I don't appreciate is political posturing and divisive statements.,97,,
635,0.97,7608.367,7624.016,"I want to take this moment to circle back and call to action, that we should have policy and not politics drive our Decision- making so we are able to create budgets that benefit all Seattleites . Thank you Tom and Allie for all of the presentations today.",97,,
636,0.97,7624.016,7628.087,Thank you chair.,97,,
637,0.97,7628.087,7631.49,Thank you very much.,98,,
638,0.97,7631.49,7633.559,"Councilmember Strauss, for your comments.",98,,
639,0.97,7633.559,7637.663,"Well said, I agree.",98,,
640,0.97,7637.663,7645.17,"I know there are a few other folks who had indicated, I thought by way of hand that you wanted to speak.",98,,
641,0.97,7645.17,7647.406,I don't see one Video right now.,98,,
642,0.97,7647.406,7676.235,"If there are no other folks who want to say anything at this juncture, I will just reiterate, thanks to every Councilmember who has spoken, to our central staff for this really helpful overview and presentation, and, we want to reiterate how important it is that we have this level of detail in terms of both our understanding in the public's understanding on how the proposed budget was compiled, so that we now have a foundation for which to build upon.",98,,
643,0.97,7676.235,7682.541,"Ask the questions, identify issues, which we are slated to do over the next three meetings.",98,,
644,0.97,7682.541,7696.288,"This type of work is really important for us to be able to break down what is in the budget, as it has been transmitted and also to break down what the process is and why we are going to be Deliberating certain pieces as we move forward.",98,,
645,0.97,7696.288,7734.96,"Again, the information we have received for quarter three Supplementals, is going to be very important for us as we take on, looking at Q3 so we have a better understanding of what will the foundation be for us to build upon as we think about potential changes, for example to address that $13 million hole in the budget, and also the issues that we have spoken to around concerns regarding the reduction from the strategic investments, the community driven strategic investments.",98,,
646,0.97,7734.96,7739.998,And I appreciate Tom and Lisa calling that out because it was somewhat of a surprise.,98,,
647,0.97,7739.998,7742.267,"I know to me, and I'm sure to many of you.",98,,
648,0.97,7742.267,7749.174,So having a better sense of where these pieces came from is very helpful.,98,,
649,0.97,7749.174,7761.12,Dan began to articulate some of the ways we could see that 30 million fitting in with some of the millions made by the executive office.,98,,
650,0.97,7761.12,7763.789,We will have a chance to have more conversations about that moving forward.,98,,
651,0.97,7763.789,7772.131,"If there are no additional comments and I'm seeing none, the last two comments for me in terms of, signaling what else this presentation means is.",98,,
652,0.97,7772.131,7793.018,"We just have a lot of work in front of us to make sure that small businesses and workers have the support they need so that as people deal with the complications of Covid-19 and the flu, people have the protections they need.",98,,
653,0.97,7793.018,7798.724,I'm really concerned about the economic stability of our region and making sure that we are investing in what small businesses and those workers who are essential workers need.,98,,
654,0.97,7798.724,7809.668,And wanting to make sure that we have small business and worker support as well built into the budget.,98,,
655,0.97,7809.668,7827.352,"Very quickly, on the question of Covid-19, I hope everybody has seen the articles, I'm just myself right now looking at a New York Times article.",99,,
