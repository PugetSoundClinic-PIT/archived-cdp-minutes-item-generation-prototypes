161,0.97,641.574,658.29,"While we have heard and understand the good intentions of the county, in proposing to acquire this property, without specific language codified in Legislations, those intentions will change, based on the outcomes of future elections and future realities.",25,,

170,0.97,742.441,749.315,We believe the only solution is for the community partner with the county and city to make this a successful state.,25,,

200,0.97,878.677,884.316,"In each case, it took adjacent property owners and effective communities to produce positive experiences there.",30,,
201,0.97,884.316,897.196,I believe we can partner with the county and the city to make this Assuccessful place and transfer of property is not necessary to accomplish our collective goals.,30,,
202,0.97,897.196,900.933,I urge you to consider about the proposed transfer.,30,,
203,0.97,900.933,904.57,The county's proposed transfer language is broad and subjective.,30,,
204,0.97,904.57,908.073,The County has no urban parks in his portfolio.,30,,
205,0.97,908.073,914.246,And has provided no information about how they will Fund and management or operate the park in the future.,30,,
206,0.97,914.246,918.584,An example is that the fence could be changed.,30,,
207,0.97,918.584,927.259,"Additionally, the proposed transfer of County properties includes fragments of properties.",31,,
208,0.97,927.259,932.197,"Only one new Park, which is in South park.",31,,
209,0.97,932.197,933.699,Likely contains Contaminants.,31,,
210,0.97,933.699,942.841,The transfer language States that environmental cleanup will be the city's responsibility and there are no funds included for that work.,31,,
211,0.97,942.841,948.881,I understand the principles to the city are important for the county.,31,,
212,0.97,948.881,956.555,"However, this takes South Park in Pioneer square by transferring critical public space, and taking it away from another community.",31,,
213,0.97,956.555,960.726,City Hall Park is an irreplaceable park.,31,,
214,0.97,960.726,973.739,And provides the only green space in an area South that serves the lowest populations in all of King County.,31,,
215,0.97,973.739,983.182,"City should maintain ownership, Activateing.",31,,
216,0.97,983.182,984.45,"Thank you, Beth.",32,,
217,0.97,984.45,987.82,Our next public Commenter is Rebecca bear.,32,,
218,0.97,987.82,991.857,Press Star 69 and begin speaking whenever ready.,32,,
219,0.97,991.857,996.328,Hello.,33,,
220,0.97,996.328,997.429,Can you hear me?,33,,
221,0.97,997.429,997.83,Yes.,34,,
222,0.97,997.83,998.263,We can hear you.,34,,
223,0.97,998.263,1000.366,Okay.,35,,
224,0.97,1000.366,1002.968,Great.,35,,
225,0.97,1002.968,1009.942,"This is Rebecca bear, I'm the Ceo of the Seattle parks recreation.",36,,
226,0.97,1009.942,1011.677,I'm here to represent the role.,36,,
227,0.97,1011.677,1017.816,To ensure that city hall park remains in Perpetuity a park for the community.,36,,
228,0.97,1017.816,1022.087,To the preservation--through the preservation of the park.,36,,
229,0.97,1022.087,1022.588,Codified in legislation.,36,,
230,0.97,1022.788,1034.199,"And it needs to ensure, regardless of whether or not or King County we need to ensure the park remains a park.",36,,
231,0.97,1034.199,1048.18,"In addition, we really want to ensure that the community is engaged as you heard a few community members speak today, in the process of design to ensure that they are taking into account in the long-term care and usage of the park.",36,,
232,0.97,1048.18,1051.316,Funding for the park is also very significant.,36,,
233,0.97,1051.316,1058.557,"We want to ensure that there is funding for the park, long- term, focused on funding the active space for the entire community.",36,,
234,0.97,1058.557,1063.362,"And to that end, there has been a lot of work done by the city.",36,,
235,0.97,1063.362,1067.266,Around as referred to earlier in this area.,36,,
236,0.97,1067.266,1078.277,"Occidental Park, Pioneer square, et cetera, both public and private interests have funded activation and community building in those spaces and they have transformed significantly.",36,,
237,0.97,1078.277,1088.587,"And then Finally, management of the park is complex and requires inclusion of the community as a part of that process.",36,,
238,0.97,1088.587,1098.23,"We are concerned, again, that I- 42 is not being fulfilled here because the current Personals are not within the community.",36,,
239,0.97,1098.23,1118.517,"And would like to see the Council continue to do work on insuring that they have all the questions answered around funding, maintenance, operations and ensuring that this piece of property remains a park in Perpetuity, before any land transfers or if land transfers were to happen.",36,,
240,0.97,1118.517,1118.784,Thank you.,36,,
241,0.97,1118.984,1128.26,Our next Speaker is Patrick Oishi.,37,,
242,0.97,1128.26,1133.899,Good afternoon.,38,,
243,0.97,1133.899,1140.305,My name is Patrick Alishi.,38,,
244,0.97,1140.305,1146.078,I'm speaking today as the Presiding judge of King County court.,38,,
245,0.97,1146.078,1148.847,As well as long-time citizen of the city of Seattle.,38,,
246,0.97,1148.847,1164.296,"First, I want to thank committee chair Lewis and the other Councilmembers for allowing me to give public comment on item 2, which is the city hall park land transfer.",38,,
247,0.97,1164.296,1169.735,I now ask to support the land transfer for three important reasons.,38,,
248,0.97,1169.735,1179.344,"One, city hall Park is quite literally the front yard of the King County courthouse, which is the seat of King County government.",38,,
249,0.97,1179.344,1187.219,And it should be part of the county's downtown civic campus.,38,,
250,0.97,1187.219,1204.436,"Second, the land transfer would preserve access to justice in the access to the courthouse for all Litigants, jurors, and employees, who vitally need access to the courthouse.",38,,
251,0.97,1204.436,1211.577,"And third, the land transfer would support public safety for all.",38,,
252,0.97,1211.577,1220.719,"So for those reasons, again, I would respectfully that the city support the land transfer.",38,,
253,0.97,1220.719,1220.986,Thank you.,38,,
254,0.97,1221.119,1224.523,Thank you.,39,,
255,0.97,1224.523,1227.426,Our next public Commenter is David Haines.,39,,
256,0.97,1227.426,1230.829,"David, whenever you're ready.",39,,
257,0.97,1230.829,1244.476,"Thank you, David Haines, District 7. the central library is a warehouse echo.",40,,
258,0.97,1244.476,1250.382,"A Noise-Polluting distracting irritation, with Irrespectful people, dumping their drama on you.",40,,
259,0.97,1250.382,1257.022,"When you're minding your business, reading or on a computer, there's all of these people constantly making noise and distracting you.",40,,
260,0.97,1257.022,1257.389,It's outrageous.,40,,
261,0.97,1257.522,1268.367,Library leadership has never done anything over the last two years to give patrons a reprieve from the ridiculous lack of personal quiet space.,40,,
262,0.97,1268.367,1271.136,It needs to be addressed.,40,,
263,0.97,1271.136,1291.69,"Secondly and Separately, the fact city council is transferring a city park to the county, is proof City Hall is an utter failure at public safety that is rooted in the Democratic party's policies of exempting crack, Meth, heroin and Quintano pushers from jail.",40,,
264,0.97,1291.69,1310.742,"Escalating most of the violence, Imploding society, Victimizing, and making the homeless crisis more difficult, as unqualified Wrap-Around services profit off of failed efforts, all while the county continues to exempt drug pushers from jail, too.",40,,
265,0.97,1310.742,1316.648,"It doesn't matter which County exercises the park, especially King County judges.",40,,
266,0.97,1316.648,1360.392,"Now, the fact that homeless crisis continues with nothing for homeless this week on the Council agenda is proof city council doesn't care and never should have redirected a lot of the American rescue plan dollars to buy off George Floyd and black lives matter protestors, with two separate lump sum payments of $30 million each, for $60 million, stolen from the homeless crisis, so Council could buy off allies and partners in Re- election support, quelling protests, using organizers, paid as if experts on public safety, alternative policing, and equity, creating and running interference for evil criminals who have been",40,,
267,0.97,1360.392,1361.827,Thank you.,41,,

275,0.97,1391.156,1394.96,And I'm speaking today on our interest Ino and support for the land transfer.,42,,
276,0.97,1395.16,1413.311,There must be some Miscommunicatin out there because everything I've heard is that the county has provided amended comment language that ensures that the property remains a park.,42,,
277,0.97,1413.311,1418.75,"And play, in and around the Pioneer square and county downtown campus.",42,,
278,0.97,1418.75,1423.221,"Given that, as the basis, I see tremendous benefit for the land transfer.",42,,
279,0.97,1423.221,1434.9,"And I would say to those people who are concerned about homeless, aren't homeless people entitled to a beautiful Park, just like everyone else?",42,,
280,0.97,1434.9,1435.167,Thank you.,42,,
281,0.97,1435.3,1441.273,"Mr. chair, that concludes our public comment signups.",43,,

345,0.97,1703.935,1705.437,I thought that was funny.,54,,
346,0.97,1705.437,1706.805,"Anyway, thank you.",54,,
347,0.97,1706.938,1711.209,I'm glad you're here.,54,,

349,0.97,1715.547,1723.588,"I'm seeing now, looking at our virtually present Councilmembers and not seeing any questions.",55,,
350,0.97,1723.588,1728.727,This is a great opportunity to appoint a new board member.,55,,
351,0.97,1728.727,1736.634,"And you know, we're viewing in advance, nominee Mehdi's credentials was just a great experience.",55,,
352,0.97,1736.634,1758.923,"And being in this position now, of chairing the committee that oversees Seattle public library, in addition to Seattle parks, it's been a great opportunity, too, to get to know the library foundation, which Commissioner nominee Mehdi has serve on.",55,,
353,0.97,1758.923,1764.028,"And I wonder if I might ask, as a question before we proceed to a vote.",55,,
354,0.97,1764.028,1768.633,The opportunities to further increase the collaboration between the board and the foundation.,55,,
355,0.97,1768.633,1773.004,It's been a great opportunity Transitioning in at the same time.,55,,
356,0.97,1773.004,1775.974,Tom has been Transitioning as chief librarian.,55,,
357,0.97,1775.974,1786.985,"To be able to really network with and collaborate with the foundation as a resource, which a lot of our departments don't have the luxury of having, such an involved and active foundation.",55,,
358,0.97,1786.985,1804.669,"And I just wonder what some of your vision, having been extensively involved in that programming and now taking on this role, what some of the opportunities are to increase that level of partnership.",55,,
359,0.97,1804.669,1821.052,"I think it's absolutely fundamental that the library foundation and the library and the friends of the library work together, in both providing a vision for the city and then actually Garnering the necessary support for that.",56,,
360,0.97,1821.186,1834.799,"Back when I was working at the library and then the library foundation, there was that, sort of Synchronicity, if you will.",56,,
361,0.97,1834.799,1845.41,"And it allowed for the library to actually create programs and move in forward, in pretty quick and earnest fashion.",56,,
362,0.97,1845.41,1847.645,And I absolutely believe that is necessary.,56,,
363,0.97,1847.645,1855.486,"If there are organizations that are supposed to be serving the library public and they're at odds, it's just a wasted opportunity.",56,,
364,0.97,1855.62,1865.029,And I'm not sure that I could say right now what those--how that needs to happen.,56,,
365,0.97,1865.029,1884.282,"But I do think that working with Jonna ward, at the foundation, working with the foundation board, and I know that the existing board has been doing that, but doing more around that will allow us to bring forth a vision and actually bring it to fruition.",56,,

433,0.97,2124.288,2125.089,I'll start with this.,77,,
434,0.97,2125.089,2128.025,It started in detail.,77,,
435,0.97,2128.025,2143.241,"The updated Covenant language explicitly said the city hall property shawl, in Perpetuitt Petuity.",77,,
436,0.97,2143.241,2151.616,"And as we said, in visions, this space will be a safe, healthy environment for everyone to use as open space.",77,,
437,0.97,2151.616,2152.583,The campus surrounds space.,77,,
438,0.97,2152.583,2161.459,And having the park will allow us to have continuity with the properties.,77,,
439,0.97,2161.459,2166.831,As we continue to have the campus.,77,,
440,0.97,2166.831,2169.567,Day resource officer for those what need it.,77,,
441,0.97,2169.567,2175.339,"This will, indeed be a safe space for our community.",77,,
442,0.97,2175.339,2178.776,And I'm sure everyone will be in line with that.,77,,
443,0.97,2178.776,2180.278,And we had conversations prior to.,77,,
444,0.97,2180.278,2185.75,"And after the last Committee hearing, ensuring that the park will remain Openspace.",77,,
445,0.97,2185.75,2188.186,The language will reflect that.,77,,
446,0.97,2188.186,2201.165,We also Transmited the plans to County Council as well as in Council Kohl-Welles.,77,,
447,0.97,2201.165,2206.437,It will be done hand in hand with the community if and when that transfer is complete to the city.,77,,
448,0.97,2206.437,2211.108,"With that, before I pass it over to Tom, to be in the short power point.",77,,
449,0.97,2211.108,2219.517,"Then answer any questions you may have, I'll hand it over to Councilmember Kohl-Welles for remarks.",77,,
450,0.97,2219.517,2219.784,Thank you.,77,,
451,0.97,2219.784,2220.117,Councilmember?,77,,
452,0.97,2220.117,2225.056,"Thank you very much, Karan.",78,,
453,0.97,2225.056,2235.032,And thank you for including us on your agenda today.,78,,
454,0.97,2235.032,2239.237,"I'm Jean Kohl-Welles, council district within the city of Seattle.",78,,
455,0.97,2239.237,2240.104,And I live in Belltown.,78,,
456,0.97,2240.104,2250.448,"And thank you to all the people at the city and the county, who have put in an extraordinary amount of time and effort on this project, not just over the past year.",78,,
457,0.97,2250.448,2268.332,"But for many, many years before Councilmember Sally bag shot down Straus, Rod Dambowski, our current presiding Superior Court judge, Parick Oishi, and Jim Rogers.",78,,
458,0.97,2268.332,2278.042,"And judge Jim--excuse me, Judge Sean O'Donnell and director Caroline Walan ever the county's Department executive services.",78,,
459,0.97,2278.042,2288.386,"And chair of the important courthouse vicinity improvement project group that worked with the city, with Seattle parks, community organizations, many others.",78,,
460,0.97,2288.386,2292.59,On what to do about the vicinity of the courthouse.,78,,
461,0.97,2292.59,2294.759,And that is until Covid struck.,78,,
462,0.97,2294.892,2308.939,"I also give a lot of thanks to mayors Harrell and Durkan and Councilmember Debora Juarez, as chair of the parks committee last year.",78,,
463,0.97,2308.939,2317.214,"As having chaired our budget committee over the last two years, now I chair the committee as a whole.",78,,
464,0.97,2317.214,2325.69,"I became acutely aware of the pandemic's effects on our county operations, but also on the Once-Beautiful City Hall Park, adjacent to the courthouse.",78,,
465,0.97,2325.89,2341.472,"However, when Covid struck, employees in the neighborhood at Pioneer square, many of them stopped coming to their workplaces.",78,,
466,0.97,2341.472,2341.872,Businesses closed.,78,,
467,0.97,2342.006,2342.807,Including restaurants.,78,,
468,0.97,2342.94,2356.554,"And the park park's once beautiful presence, began to be used for unintended purposes.",78,,
469,0.97,2356.554,2359.857,"We're seen what improvements have been seen, which were stellar.",78,,
470,0.97,2359.857,2368.232,A lot of that because of Councilmembers Straus and Dombowski.,78,,
471,0.97,2368.232,2376.507,"And of course, we became aware of the hardships for so many displaced and experiencing homelessness.",78,,
472,0.97,2376.507,2392.323,"Many for the first time a lot of thought and collaboration, because of all of these factors, went into the legislation that I introduced a year ago and that is now before you.",78,,
473,0.97,2392.323,2403.667,"A couple of weeks ago, I walked past this beautiful Plaza, right out here, adjoining City Hall out to the West.",78,,
474,0.97,2403.667,2404.568,And a celebration was going on.,78,,
475,0.97,2404.835,2407.338,I heard music.,78,,
476,0.97,2407.471,2415.079,"And laughter, as the city and county employees, enjoyed a free lunch, put on by the city.",78,,
477,0.97,2415.212,2418.749,As they were returning to their workplace.,78,,
478,0.97,2418.749,2419.984,So it was really a wonderful event.,78,,
479,0.97,2420.184,2435.065,"All I could think about, though, was how fortunate this city is, and city employees are, to have this facility, adjoining City Hall.",78,,
480,0.97,2435.266,2452.483,And I kept thinking about the that I was feeling that we did not have a similar place.,78,,
481,0.97,2452.483,2474.972,"And how wonderful it would be, if we could actually acquire City Hall Park, so that we could have such a joyous, wonderful, welcoming place for not only our employees, but for jurors, visitors to the courthouse, people living in the neighborhood businesses in the community.",78,,
482,0.97,2474.972,2475.973,"Unfortunately, that is not now the case.",78,,
483,0.97,2476.106,2484.748,But I hope that we are close to realizing that vision that I have had.,78,,
484,0.97,2484.748,2488.686,And I think it is a good deal for all.,78,,
485,0.97,2488.686,2493.424,"A real Win-Win situation for the city and its prints, its workers, its businesses.",78,,
486,0.97,2493.424,2504.101,But also for the county and all in Pioneer square.,78,,
487,0.97,2504.101,2513.677,"This agreement that could occur with this transaction, will help both the county government and the city government, and the parks throughout our region.",78,,
488,0.97,2513.677,2518.516,Seattle will gain even more green space in its parks throughout the city.,78,,
489,0.97,2518.516,2524.255,"And King County will have a park of its own, in the heart of the county seat.",78,,
490,0.97,2524.255,2533.898,A park that will remain a park for.,78,,
491,0.97,2533.898,2538.335,The stewardship of this space will not be taken lightly.,78,,
492,0.97,2538.335,2543.607,It's also for us to consider original Jefferson street.,78,,
493,0.97,2543.607,2548.913,I think you'll see a slide on what it looked like at one point in time.,78,,
494,0.97,2548.913,2551.916,The front Courtguard of the building flowed into the park.,78,,
495,0.97,2551.916,2554.818,They Complemented each other for nearly 80 years.,78,,
496,0.97,2554.818,2558.789,Just think of that.,78,,
497,0.97,2558.789,2565.229,"However, in 1967, this entrance was converted into a loading dock, which is currently full of supplies and Dumpsters.",78,,
498,0.97,2565.362,2574.038,"The original extravagant, Alaskan marble inside the building, is still preserved.",78,,
499,0.97,2574.038,2580.945,While the marble on the original entrance has been damaged or covered in the layer of concrete.,78,,
500,0.97,2580.945,2582.813,A lot of studies have been done.,78,,
501,0.97,2582.813,2588.419,"We could restore that original entrance, that historic Entryway.",78,,
502,0.97,2588.419,2596.76,Which would also provide a very functional purpose that would lead to more foot traffic in the park.,78,,
503,0.97,2596.76,2607.605,"And off of third Avenue, where there Unfortunately have been a number of violent, high-profile instances of violence.",78,,
504,0.97,2607.605,2610.874,Adding natural flow to this area.,78,,
505,0.97,2610.874,2623.487,"Would result in a safer space, without having to rely on heavy law enforcement or punitive architectural design.",78,,
506,0.97,2623.487,2626.757,Our parks Department refers to King County as the park in your backyard.,78,,
507,0.97,2626.757,2632.463,"And if that's the case, we will treat City Hall Park, like our little French porch.",78,,
508,0.97,2632.463,2637.601,"Or as it was referred to, as the courthouse's front yard, decades ago.",78,,
509,0.97,2637.601,2642.74,"A welcoming space for all to enjoy, just like the Plaza that you have right out here.",78,,
510,0.97,2642.74,2643.14,But consider this.,78,,
511,0.97,2643.273,2645.643,And I don't know if anybody has really thought about this.,78,,
512,0.97,2645.776,2655.019,"If your Plaza, which is so wonderful, right here, were owned by another jurisdiction.",78,,
513,0.97,2655.019,2670.234,"If it were owned by King County, or something else, and you did not have a say over what were to happen in it and what kind of celebrations that you could host, I'll tell you.",78,,
514,0.97,2670.234,2679.576,It's really frustrating for us that we don't have the park in our name.,78,,
515,0.97,2679.576,2688.552,"We've heard arguments from some that this transition will somehow read to the county, having a heavy hand over what happens in and around the park.",78,,
516,0.97,2688.552,2695.926,"And that we will somehow lose sight of our values and policies, weighted in equity.",78,,
517,0.97,2695.926,2698.495,And that couldn't be farther from the truth.,78,,
518,0.97,2698.495,2705.936,We as a county have a proven history of working with service providers and communities to deliver services and programs to those most in need.,78,,
519,0.97,2705.936,2711.708,And in a way that includes robust engagement and collaboration.,78,,
520,0.97,2711.708,2717.981,"And we do so, very importantly, by centering equity, as our government's true worth.",78,,
521,0.97,2718.182,2728.225,"Let's not forget, too, when the encampment began to grow in city hall park two years ago, we didn't sweep it.",78,,
522,0.97,2728.358,2734.731,We didn't ask the city of Seattle to sweep it either.,78,,
523,0.97,2734.731,2743.941,"But instead, we partnered with community organizations, the PD a's just care program.",78,,
524,0.97,2743.941,2751.448,"The city, chief Seattle Club, and others to work with the occupants of the park to meet their unique needs.",78,,
525,0.97,2751.448,2755.552,And humanely transition them to supportive or transitional housing.,78,,
526,0.97,2755.552,2756.787,And that did happen.,78,,
527,0.97,2756.987,2762.192,"What also happened, though, was a murder.",78,,
528,0.97,2762.192,2767.197,"A 2-year-old little girl, wandering around the park, without any adult with her.",78,,
529,0.97,2767.331,2770.467,Stabbings.,78,,
530,0.97,2770.467,2781.845,"And Unfortunately, a lot of very, very challenging situations, which could be worked with the city to have resolution there.",78,,
531,0.97,2781.845,2783.58,But there's a fence up around the park now.,78,,
532,0.97,2783.58,2785.649,We want to bring that down.,78,,
533,0.97,2785.649,2793.724,"We want to make sure that the park remains in Perpetuity as a beautiful, welcoming park.",78,,
534,0.97,2793.724,2798.795,We've had to weigh all of this in a global pandemic.,78,,
535,0.97,2798.929,2799.463,Very difficult.,78,,
536,0.97,2799.663,2826.19,"We've heard that this process has been rushed, but it's been over a year now, with just countless meetings, Collaborations, very hard work on it, very thoughtful work, and we are here now, as you know, and Karan mentioned, well willing to negotiate and bring about the best possible resolution for all concerned.",78,,
537,0.97,2826.19,2839.503,"We, as a body, the King County Council, approved motion 20210328 last fall, after multiple hearings, calling on the executive to transmit this deal to make the park a park.",78,,
538,0.97,2839.503,2848.779,We have a very lengthy report from the executive transmitted last January that really spells out the details of what would happen.,78,,
539,0.97,2848.912,2876.64,"In closing, I would like to say that prior to any activation of the park, we will be going through an enormous amount of community engagement in a specified amendment to our ordinance, sending over this, transmitting this agreement to you.",78,,
540,0.97,2876.64,2879.209,And I look forward to this park.,78,,

543,0.97,2884.815,2885.249,To remain a park.,78,,
544,0.97,2885.449,2894.558,"But it will be a more beautiful, inviting, welcoming park than it's ever been.",78,,
545,0.97,2894.558,2895.792,It will be functional.,78,,
546,0.97,2895.792,2899.363,It will be the pride of Pioneer square.,78,,

563,0.97,2959.423,2962.693,And you would like the same.,82,,
564,0.97,2962.693,2966.897,"So just want to, at the start, say that.",82,,
565,0.97,2966.897,2967.23,Absolutely.,83,,
566,0.97,2967.23,2983.847,"You had mentioned the Covenant language when the county was here last, it sounded like from your remarks that that language is available.",84,,
567,0.97,2983.847,2984.381,Is that the case?,84,,
568,0.97,2984.381,2989.252,And is it available for public review?,84,,
569,0.97,2989.252,2991.188,That is correct.,85,,
570,0.97,2991.188,2991.521,Councilmember.,85,,
571,0.97,2991.521,2995.225,I believe it's with city central staff as well.,85,,
572,0.97,2995.225,2995.592,Yes.,86,,
573,0.97,2995.592,3001.698,"If we want to Delve into that, we do have a wish list from central staff.",86,,
574,0.97,3001.698,3002.833,And we could do an overview.,86,,
575,0.97,3002.833,3005.836,"It's up to you, chair.",87,,
576,0.97,3005.836,3010.941,"I just wanted to confirm what I thought I heard that it has been drafted, it is available.",87,,
577,0.97,3010.941,3014.111,Whether or not you want to go into that.,87,,
578,0.97,3014.111,3016.48,I have my question answered for the time being.,87,,
579,0.97,3016.613,3024.855,"I did have one other question, though, about the Sipa process, which I think is probably something that Lish would have to answer as well.",87,,
580,0.97,3024.855,3025.222,Yeah.,88,,
581,0.97,3025.222,3029.292,"So I'm happy to get into all of that, in terms of additional process.",88,,
582,0.97,3029.493,3037.434,Like where the Covenant language is and the Sipa Analis and central staff.,88,,
583,0.97,3037.434,3045.242,And I believe super intendant Williams would be helpful for Parsing in that.,88,,
584,0.97,3045.242,3048.678,I believe there will be helpful information in county presentation.,88,,
585,0.97,3048.678,3051.248,So I want to make sure we don't cut that short.,88,,
586,0.97,3051.248,3053.283,So why don't we finish that up.,88,,
587,0.97,3053.283,3057.287,And that might be a component of the presentation as well.,88,,

649,0.97,3225.789,3227.424,Yes.,115,,

659,0.97,3249.446,3252.215,So I'm not going to Belabor the point.,121,,
660,0.97,3252.215,3268.264,"But just in summary, in consummate direction from the Council, executive Constantine worked with Then-Mayor Durkan to propose a Council to city owned park in exchange for County owned property within the city limits.",121,,
661,0.97,3268.264,3271.768,"This is almost a year ago, as memory serves.",121,,
662,0.97,3271.768,3277.073,And the Council adopted the proposed transfer through an ordinance in December of 2021.,121,,
663,0.97,3277.207,3288.018,"So just for reference, what you're seeing here is a photo of the property temporary usage by King County.",121,,
664,0.97,3288.018,3292.422,And this is a general box around the area of city hall park.,121,,
665,0.97,3292.422,3301.364,"And following it, I have also included a photo of the parcels to be received by the city of Seattle.",121,,

670,0.97,3310.84,3323.053,", just because it's sort of awkwardly shaped.",124,,
671,0.97,3323.053,3323.219,We.,124,,
672,0.97,3323.219,3326.423,What you have in the legislative package.,125,,
673,0.97,3326.556,3329.059,This is just a general box around the area.,125,,
674,0.97,3329.059,3331.461,It is not specific to the point.,125,,
675,0.97,3331.461,3334.664,"Don't use the Red boxes, property lines.",125,,
676,0.97,3334.664,3336.8,This is not the property description.,125,,
677,0.97,3336.8,3347.21,"Like the legal description, you will see of property transferred.",125,,
678,0.97,3347.21,3348.545,Including Dilling way.,126,,
679,0.97,3348.545,3349.679,And Jefferson Street here.,126,,
680,0.97,3349.679,3355.185,"And this property across the street, this green area here as well.",126,,
681,0.97,3355.185,3362.959,"I just wanted to clarify, in case members of the public were confused by the box.",127,,
682,0.97,3362.959,3364.027,The acquisition.,128,,
683,0.97,3364.027,3365.328,I want want to ask to worry.,128,,
684,0.97,3365.328,3367.03,We were giving that right away.,128,,
685,0.97,3367.03,3370.333,We've had plenty of conversations with them.,129,,
686,0.97,3370.333,3373.937,And there is another slide later that show negligence more specificity.,129,,
687,0.97,3373.937,3387.217,"Legislation that is before you, there are property descriptions, like, you know, very specific.",129,,
688,0.97,3387.217,3391.287,"Just like an appraisal, or a surveyor will do.",129,,
689,0.97,3391.287,3391.554,Great.,130,,
690,0.97,3391.554,3394.624,Thanks.,131,,
691,0.97,3394.624,3401.998,And the following three or four pages are the properties received by the city of Seattle.,132,,
692,0.97,3401.998,3409.606,"There are properties, roads property, wastewater property, and Metro property on this sheet.",132,,
693,0.97,3409.606,3419.149,"And you'll notice Tlike particularly, the wastewater property is already noted as a park.",132,,
694,0.97,3419.149,3423.953,And some facilities and tax title properties again.,132,,
695,0.97,3424.087,3427.323,And viewpoint park.,132,,
696,0.97,3427.457,3434.264,A Ravine open space area.,132,,
697,0.97,3434.264,3434.964,Green belts.,132,,
698,0.97,3434.964,3435.265,Green space.,132,,
699,0.97,3435.398,3441.104,And properties adjacent to the Burt Gilman trail.,132,,
700,0.97,3441.237,3455.552,"Now, on this slide, what I'm trying to depict here is the county property and city property in green are city properties.",133,,
701,0.97,3455.552,3459.255,So this is kind of city hall park.,133,,
702,0.97,3459.255,3461.724,And Dilling way right of way.,133,,
703,0.97,3461.724,3463.393,Jefferson Street here at the courthouse.,133,,
704,0.97,3463.393,3469.599,"And then this, if you're familiar is the fire station and emergency operations center for the city.",133,,
705,0.97,3469.599,3472.502,That's what that square is.,133,,
706,0.97,3472.502,3476.039,But these blue spaces here are County buildings.,133,,
707,0.97,3476.039,3482.145,And we own and operate several facilities in downtown Seattle.,133,,
708,0.97,3482.278,3491.221,"Most of which are on this, what we referred to as our civic campus, centered on fourth Avenue, between James and Yesler.",133,,
709,0.97,3491.221,3499.395,"These include the Conty courthouse, the administration building, the Correctional facility, Chinook building, and the Yesir building.",133,,
710,0.97,3499.529,3500.964,King Street center.,133,,
711,0.97,3501.097,3511.507,Located in Pioneer square.,133,,
712,0.97,3521.05,3529.292,"The county is committed to a public process prior to activation of the park, and it will remain green space.",134,,
713,0.97,3529.292,3540.27,What I'd like to reiterate here is that we are in the middle of a very intensive civic campus planning effort.,134,,
714,0.97,3540.27,3549.312,It's expected to look at our future facility needs.,134,,
715,0.97,3549.312,3553.816,Our County campus has served customers and employees for more than 100 years.,134,,
716,0.97,3553.816,3557.22,You'll see in pictures what it was like previously.,134,,
717,0.97,3557.22,3586.683,"And a number of years ago, the county Council, when evaluating the budget for the facilities management division, they wanted to get some As-Built drawings for the courthouse to help us figure out what to Prioritize.",134,,
718,0.97,3586.683,3600.196,"We have a number of facilities that are functionally outdated, no longer meet needs, and we're facing costly maintenance and repairs that might prove to be unsustainable.",134,,
719,0.97,3600.196,3602.832,So we need to take a longer term view.,134,,
720,0.97,3602.832,3610.039,"So that effort is going on, as well as City Hall park conversation.",134,,
721,0.97,3610.039,3617.313,"So in any scenario that we are looking at for the future of King County, we're not going anywhere.",134,,
722,0.97,3617.313,3621.25,This is our home.,134,,
723,0.97,3621.25,3622.585,This is our space.,134,,
724,0.97,3622.585,3628.591,"We care about the space, and we will care for the park.",134,,
725,0.97,3628.591,3632.829,Let me just leave you with this.,134,,
726,0.97,3632.829,3643.172,The photo on the left is the new one added to what you have in your legislative packet.,134,,
727,0.97,3643.172,3644.273,That's from 1917.,134,,
728,0.97,3644.273,3652.181,"And as Councilmember indicated, this shows kind of the entrance what we call the South entrance, the county courthouse.",134,,
729,0.97,3652.181,3655.985,The big lovely trees aren't there quite yet.,134,,
730,0.97,3655.985,3663.026,"But this is the open space, the gathering area for the courthouse, the grand South entrance.",134,,
731,0.97,3663.026,3674.804,"Now you see when you move up the key to the right you will see a 1949, the addition to the courthouse, and we still have the entrance on the South side.",134,,
732,0.97,3674.804,3679.709,The next photo just to the right of that is what it currently looks like.,134,,
733,0.97,3679.709,3687.15,"So that is currently Jefferson alley, with cars parked, and the fence between Jefferson alley and city hall park.",134,,
734,0.97,3687.15,3692.522,This is what it currently looks like.,134,,
735,0.97,3692.522,3717.98,"And on the bottom right is a depiction, vision of what it might look like in the future, if we have, again, we're working with the city or hoping to work with the city on the vacation of Jefferson alley and Dilling, which would open up a little more space for access and open space for people to enjoy.",134,,
736,0.97,3717.98,3725.354,The idea is potentially reopening that South entrance and kind of activating--helping to activate that park.,134,,
737,0.97,3725.354,3734.497,"Because what we have all tried before, and was successful, Pre- Covid, was activation of the park.",134,,
738,0.97,3734.497,3737.633,We actually saw that park turning around.,134,,
739,0.97,3737.633,3743.306,And I've been working in and around this area for over 30 years.,134,,
740,0.97,3743.306,3746.676,I've seen the ebbs and flows of this park.,134,,
741,0.97,3746.676,3749.879,It was definitely on the up swing on the time before Covid.,134,,
742,0.97,3749.879,3760.857,"So with all of that being said, this is an integral part of the future that we're envisioning for our civic campus.",134,,
743,0.97,3760.857,3775.905,"We are about--just about ready to begin a vigorous public engagement program, both on the civic campus master plan, and we're hoping City Hall park as well.",134,,
744,0.97,3775.905,3780.943,And with that I will close and thank you for your assistance in getting this up before you.,134,,
745,0.97,3780.943,3782.778,Thank you for the presentation.,135,,
746,0.97,3782.778,3790.186,Can we stay on that slide for just a moment before you--or go back to that?,135,,
747,0.97,3790.186,3791.287,Sorry.,136,,
748,0.97,3791.287,3791.821,I Unshared too quickly.,136,,
749,0.97,3791.821,3795.391,Unless it's Tbiernd put that back up there.,137,,
750,0.97,3795.391,3799.795,"Well, we'll see.",138,,
751,0.97,3799.795,3800.096,How's that?,138,,
752,0.97,3800.096,3800.396,Perfect.,139,,
753,0.97,3800.396,3800.663,Awesome.,139,,
754,0.97,3800.663,3809.138,"This is the first time I've kind of seen concept art like this, or rather when the slide deck was shared Precommittee.",140,,
755,0.97,3809.138,3822.952,"Was the first time I had seen a concept like that, that is very compelling and goes to the core of what I think there's unanimous agreement we would like the ongoing use of that space to be.",140,,
756,0.97,3822.952,3830.86,Can I just confirm the image we're looking at?,140,,
757,0.97,3830.86,3831.494,That is Jefferson.,140,,
758,0.97,3831.494,3839.468,"That is an angle looking down Jefferson from fourth Avenue, towards 5th.",140,,
759,0.97,3839.468,3842.205,You're looking from fifth towards fourth.,141,,
760,0.97,3842.205,3844.04,"Or, wait, fourth to third.",141,,
761,0.97,3844.04,3847.176,Fourth to third.,142,,
762,0.97,3847.176,3847.476,Sorry.,143,,
763,0.97,3847.476,3848.044,Towards third.,144,,
764,0.97,3848.044,3852.114,"So just to confirm, that's what we're looking at?",144,,
765,0.97,3852.114,3852.782,Correct.,145,,
766,0.97,3852.782,3861.991,"And the way I envision it, in the upper right-hand corner of the fence along the line there, that welcome back kind of the edge of the sidewalk.",145,,
767,0.97,3861.991,3864.493,Think of it that way.,145,,
768,0.97,3864.493,3876.105,"Sought looks like from this concept the county is proposing bringing down fences, rather than adding any, just forsake of --",146,,
769,0.97,3876.105,3877.573,"For the sake of this, yes.",147,,
770,0.97,3877.573,3878.207,Yes.,148,,
771,0.97,3878.207,3887.783,I know there had been some discourse from people unfamiliar with the plans in the public record.,149,,
772,0.97,3887.783,3891.354,Indicating that the opposite might be the case.,149,,
773,0.97,3891.354,3897.76,It's good to see this design proof that opening up the open space is more of the goal.,149,,
774,0.97,3897.76,3900.029,"Sorry, Councilmember, you were about to say something.",149,,
775,0.97,3900.029,3902.665,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",150,,
776,0.97,3902.665,3903.566,"Yes, absolutely.",150,,
777,0.97,3903.566,3908.504,This just shows the park next Avenue.,150,,
778,0.97,3908.504,3922.785,"But we have other slides, too, but I don't think they're present here, that are showing design for the park Everyawful.",150,,
779,0.97,3922.785,3923.586,It's really exquisite.,150,,
780,0.97,3923.586,3935.598,This really demonstrates in a narrow way how it would change dramatically with the fence down and a pedestrian Walkway.,150,,
781,0.97,3935.598,3938.167,It's a very compelling image.,151,,
782,0.97,3938.167,3941.237,"And it is, like for us--sorry to interrupt --",152,,
783,0.97,3941.237,3942.738,"Go ahead, please.",153,,
784,0.97,3942.738,3968.864,"We are really trying to thoughtfully plan for a Reimagined campus that braces for like low carbon development, renewal of urban Ecologies, which you see in this depiction, sustainable design, and we want something that can sustain and support the region for the next 100 years.",154,,
785,0.97,3968.864,3972.501,And the facilities we have right now just don't do that.,154,,
786,0.97,3972.501,3980.343,"Again, this is going to be an extensive public engagement and outreach program that we're about to embark on.",154,,
787,0.97,3980.343,3986.949,Can more of those concepts be made available to the public?,155,,
788,0.97,3986.949,3989.185,Or are they available to the public?,155,,
789,0.97,3989.185,3996.525,It is part of what is planned for the engagement process.,156,,
790,0.97,3996.525,4012.975,"And we're really trying to be thoughtful about how we engage the public and be equitable in our planning and outcomes for the heart of the campus, so it works for everybody.",156,,
791,0.97,4012.975,4018.481,What the county provides is critical for public stitches in region.,156,,
792,0.97,4018.481,4021.45,We have an area that's welcoming for people.,156,,
793,0.97,4021.45,4036.532,"An area that the neighbors can feel comfortable in, visitors, jurors, everybody that uses both the space and county facilities should be able to feel safe and enjoy the space.",156,,
794,0.97,4036.532,4050.479,"Mr. chair, I would like to say I have seen many images, really a whole lot of them.",157,,
795,0.97,4050.479,4059.622,"University of Washington, architectural students, developing plans, there have been many, many studies.",157,,
796,0.97,4059.622,4064.627,I don't understand what the Reticence for sharing them is.,158,,
797,0.97,4064.627,4083.279,"I guess what I would--it sounds like there isn't any Reticence about sharing them, but our panelists listened through public comment today, and there is a lot of consternation and concern in the community about what might happen to the space.",158,,
798,0.97,4083.279,4092.188,And way think that the surest argument to build momentum from people in the community would be sharing images like this.,158,,
799,0.97,4092.188,4098.36,I guess I don't know why we would want to hang on to them until the future.,158,,
800,0.97,4098.36,4102.064,The community seems to be forcing an engagement process now.,158,,
801,0.97,4102.064,4108.404,So it seems like this would be a good time to make these more public.,158,,
802,0.97,4108.404,4109.271,Absolutely no Rhett tie 70s.,159,,
803,0.97,4109.271,4121.517,"When I say we are about to embark on a robust engagement process on this whole plan, we're locked and loaded and ready to go, like in the next couple of weeks.",159,,
804,0.97,4121.517,4144.406,"So it's just a matter of--we are trying to understand what was going to happen with city hall Park, because, frankly, there's a different kind of planning that happens when you're working with another jurisdiction, than if the county has control of the property.",159,,
805,0.97,4144.406,4149.545,"Frankly, it's kind of a different conversation.",159,,
806,0.97,4149.545,4150.312,It's more parties involved.,159,,
807,0.97,4150.312,4159.588,So we're hoping to get some resolution to this question and then proceeding forth.,159,,
808,0.97,4159.588,4171.033,There's no option in any of our plans that show this being anything other than cherished Parkland.,159,,
809,0.97,4171.033,4174.837,That's really good to see and hear.,160,,
810,0.97,4174.837,4189.552,"Do callers have questions of the panel before we pivot to more Process-Oriented language, things of that nature?",160,,
811,0.97,4189.552,4190.052,Councilmember Herbold?,160,,
812,0.97,4190.052,4194.79,I do.,161,,
813,0.97,4194.79,4197.059,I think Councilmember Mosqueda had the hand up.,161,,
814,0.97,4197.059,4197.96,I'm sorry.,162,,
815,0.97,4197.96,4198.561,There you go.,162,,
816,0.97,4198.561,4201.363,I do.,163,,
817,0.97,4201.363,4215.377,I am sure that Councilmember Herbold's question that she started with will nicely align with the questions that I have later on but I wanted to get a question in briefly about that last image.,163,,
818,0.97,4215.377,4235.23,"I also understand from the chair and the county's presentation, it's more likely that you've noted you have a number of various scenarios that it sounds like you're getting ready to share at a forum or a series of forums.",163,,
819,0.97,4235.23,4241.27,"So while it may not be here now, it is planned.",163,,
820,0.97,4241.27,4242.538,That's what I'm interpreting.,163,,
821,0.97,4242.538,4244.44,So feel free to Opine on that.,163,,
822,0.97,4244.44,4257.019,"And as you do get feedback from community, one of the things that I have been hearing about is the interest in continuing to hear about a Bake corridor.",163,,
823,0.97,4257.019,4270.065,"I understand folks use the fourth Avenue bike Lane, and as you have conversations with community members it would be important to understand the impact.",163,,
824,0.97,4270.065,4280.409,I'm a huge supporter of this everywhere we can but also want to make sure we have bike lanes that are accessible and that don't cause a pedestrian and cyclist interactions.,163,,
825,0.97,4280.409,4286.882,Want to thank central staff for including a nod to what that could potentially look like on page 5 of the central staff memo.,163,,
826,0.97,4286.882,4301.096,"But suns this picture was up, do you have any thoughts that you initially had about how you are going to engage with community about the preservation of bike lanes along fourth there?",163,,
827,0.97,4301.096,4301.897,"One, totally understand.",164,,
828,0.97,4301.897,4311.006,"We have been work in real time, current time with S-Dot on bike lanes and the Dilling way piece.",164,,
829,0.97,4311.006,4313.709,I know that's a part of the equation.,164,,
830,0.97,4313.709,4326.188,"If there's any Reticence that you sense from me about sharing images, about our future vision, it's that we are trying to do community engagement in a different way for this version of the civic campus plan.",164,,
831,0.97,4326.188,4334.53,"We don't want to just show the community options, a, B, C, D, E, and say, Hey, which one do you like better?",164,,
832,0.97,4334.53,4339.101,"Put dots on the map, or whatever.",164,,
833,0.97,4339.101,4355.25,"We really want to engage and hear what people are interested, and what's important to them, what the values they have are, and how that shows up in civic spaces, and kind of work from that, instead of just having pre canned options.",164,,
834,0.97,4355.25,4367.229,That's why we haven't tried to lock in specific options a through f kind of thing.,164,,
835,0.97,4367.229,4370.966,"Obviously in the community engagement, you're right, we are embarking on it.",164,,
836,0.97,4370.966,4381.61,"It has already happened, where people are voicing their interest and concerns about this remaining park space.",164,,
837,0.97,4381.61,4384.913,And bike lanes and transportation.,164,,
838,0.97,4384.913,4388.584,We are looking for ways to connect transit.,164,,
839,0.97,4388.584,4399.328,"There may be options sometime in the future, thinking about an entrance off the park that mate help activate that even more so people can come directly into that space.",164,,
840,0.97,4399.328,4399.695,Who knows.,164,,
841,0.97,4399.695,4410.739,"So that's what we expect to be listening to the community, even more than we have heard on the specific of city hall park about the entire campus.",164,,
842,0.97,4410.739,4418.514,"I'd like to add something, Mr. chair.",165,,
843,0.97,4418.514,4424.92,Another important consideration for our Council is that there be improved pedestrian walkways.,165,,
844,0.97,4424.92,4429.825,"Obviously in the park now there are, if it weren't fenced, but that's very important.",165,,
845,0.97,4429.825,4432.828,"The Bicycling, but not just Bicycling.",165,,
846,0.97,4432.828,4433.128,All wheels.,165,,
847,0.97,4433.128,4437.199,"We see a person there, looks like that's sitting in a wheelchair.",165,,
848,0.97,4437.199,4447.209,So we want to make sure there's access for all wheeled vehicles.,165,,
849,0.97,4447.209,4447.743,Councilmember Herbold.,166,,
850,0.97,4447.743,4448.51,Thanks so much.,167,,
851,0.97,4448.51,4461.824,I want to put my question he within the context of the language contained in I-42.,167,,
852,0.97,4461.824,4476.338,"I-42 requires that in change for park property, the city must receive land or a facility of equivalent or Bert size, value, location, and usefulness in the vicinity serving the same community and the same park purposes.",167,,
853,0.97,4476.338,4500.095,"So one of the things I've asked for us to consider as we discuss this is for the Council, as a Deliberative body, to consider of the elements of I-42, which parts of that initiative are important to us.",167,,
854,0.97,4500.095,4538.8,"I think we are demonstrating by our willingness to hear the proposal for a transfer, I think we are demonstrating that we are ready to forgo the requirement that the land that we are receiving serve the same community and the same park purposes with the Covenant that we would hopefully receive from the county that the park itself will continue to serve the community.",167,,
855,0.97,4538.8,4577.439,"But as relates to the swap element contained in I-4 2, which requires equivalent or better size and value, I think we need more information to evaluate, one, how important that component is in I-42, and whether or not we want to consider diverting from the spirit of I-42 in that--in those particular components of the initiative.",167,,
856,0.97,4577.439,4618.246,"And so this is just me going a long way around saying that I would still very much like to have the assessments for the other Parcells that we would receive so that we can do that analysis and that evaluation of whether or not we can say at the end of this process, should it be successful, that we just, you know, we threw out all of I- 42, or we maintained some part of I-42 because we know for a fact that what we're getting in exchange for what we're giving up is of equal value.",167,,
857,0.97,4618.246,4624.753,So just wondering where we're at on the status of that.,167,,
858,0.97,4624.753,4637.566,"I know back in April that was a topic of discussion, the appraisals for the park properties that King County proposes to give to the city of Seattle.",167,,
859,0.97,4637.566,4639.635,Just wondering whether or not we have that information.,167,,
860,0.97,4639.635,4643.338,I can comment briefly on that.,168,,
861,0.97,4643.338,4643.839,"Yes, Councilmember.",169,,
862,0.97,4643.839,4647.542,But I don't know much more than what I'm going to say.,170,,
863,0.97,4647.542,4660.722,"Our Council did not participate in all the discussions on which properties, which Parcells would be offered to the city.",170,,
864,0.97,4660.722,4677.472,"My understanding is that both the Durkin administration and the Constantine administration, that the county had negotiated on that, and that those Parcells were agreed to by both.",170,,
865,0.97,4677.472,4695.057,"I don't know if the county came up with them all and offered them, or if there was a combined effort to determine which Parcells would work for the city.",170,,
866,0.97,4695.057,4698.026,And maybe Karan or Tom would have more information.,170,,
867,0.97,4698.026,4701.763,I'm flat-out asking for the value.,171,,
868,0.97,4701.763,4702.698,I appreciate understanding that process.,171,,
869,0.97,4702.698,4707.402,"I'm trying to explain why it's important to me, as part of the Deliberative process.",171,,
870,0.97,4707.402,4719.214,"Just to jump in on this, too, we do have superintendent Williams from Council central staff what might be able to weigh in on.",172,,
871,0.97,4719.214,4725.053,I know that Tom Koney has his hand raised so maybe there is an update.,172,,
872,0.97,4725.053,4730.325,"Why don't we go to you, Tom, first, since you have your hand raised.",172,,
873,0.97,4730.325,4730.859,Council President --,173,,
874,0.97,4730.859,4733.962,I was trying to wave automatic.,174,,
875,0.97,4733.962,4734.296,Sore Ree.,175,,
876,0.97,4734.296,4759.254,"Just before we talk to parks, I want to go back in the time machine here because I was involved in the discussions with the executive and Mayor Durkan at the time before December 2021 when we--and Jeanne Kohl-Welles and worked closely about these 13 pieces of property.",176,,
877,0.97,4759.254,4780.108,"If we compare them apples to apples, my understanding now, and we don't have Jesus, but we have Christopher, was that it was a good deal, if you are just looking at money and dirt and what the city would get.",176,,
878,0.97,4780.108,4783.545,"I was in conversations with Jesus, how we did the swap, what that would mean.",176,,
879,0.97,4783.545,4825.72,"I think what I'm hearing and what I actually heard a year, 18 months ago, which thank you, Jeanne Kohl-Welles, you've always been an incredible later, was that the intent was the same, that we made sure the city walked away with a good deal, not a better deal, not just comparing dirt for dirt but also the intrinsic value of 13 pieces of property all over the city but also something that you articulated that I didn't quite understand but now I understand it better, and thank you, is that--and from the executive back then, and you, is that the county wanted to have the same access and privilege and green space that the city of Seattle has with our park to activate it.",176,,
880,0.97,4825.72,4833.395,"Because we are landlords over there, we're really not paying attention what's going on over there to activate it, to have event.",176,,
881,0.97,4833.395,4846.141,"As someone who has much older, and I've been work downtown since 1986, I have never seen that park in a good condition, ever, in all the years that I've been coming here and working downtown.",176,,
882,0.97,4846.141,4846.608,And it's unfortunate.,176,,
883,0.97,4846.608,4855.016,"I think there's a couple of years we tried to activate it with lights, and we tried to have music down there, and I know others did the same thing.",176,,
884,0.97,4855.016,4868.797,"We have been struggling with it, at least I have for the last six years as former Claire of parks, so I was very happy when Councilmember Kohl-Welles came to me.",176,,
885,0.97,4868.797,4879.274,"I appreciate the humane position the county took with people experiencing homelessness on city park grounds, that you made the decision not to remove those people and to provide services.",176,,
886,0.97,4879.274,4879.741,There's a lot of hit.,176,,
887,0.97,4879.741,4886.214,"I want to follow up on what Councilmember Herbold asked, and turn it over to Mr.",176,,
888,0.97,4886.214,4888.55,Williams who is now the act superintendent.,176,,
889,0.97,4888.55,4891.486,But these discussions have been going on quite awhile.,176,,
890,0.97,4891.486,4906.601,"There was never this land grab for the city to hand over their park to the county and the county wasn't going to use it as a park and build all kinds of things on there that would be a violation of initiative 4 2. those have never been in part of the conversations, if I can just share that.",176,,
891,0.97,4906.601,4910.372,"So thank you, Councilmember.",176,,
892,0.97,4910.372,4915.443,"Thank you, Council President, for Girkz Ving us that overview as well.",177,,
893,0.97,4915.443,4917.145,It's important context for these deliberations.,177,,
894,0.97,4917.145,4923.952,"Now we have a whole bunch of technical answers on these things we're dancing around, from our central staff.",177,,
895,0.97,4923.952,4929.658,"So why don't we let Liz go first, then Tom I know you had your hand raised.",177,,
896,0.97,4929.658,4938.233,"And if superintendent Williams has anything to add on this question, then we'll proceed to Councilmember Moss Kay could.",177,,
897,0.97,4938.233,4940.135,"So Lisch, why don't you go first.",177,,
898,0.97,4940.135,4954.516,I want to provide an update on the two questions Councilmember Herbold asked about the determination before the presentation started and then the appraisals.,178,,
899,0.97,4954.516,4955.45,They're very related.,178,,
900,0.97,4955.45,4963.825,Seattle Department of parks & amp; recreation hasn't yet issued a determination under the state environmental policy act.,178,,
901,0.97,4963.825,4977.205,"They want to make sure that the determination clearly reflects the actions required to transfer the park to King County, and working through a number of issues around the complicated property status of different parts of the park.",178,,
902,0.97,4977.205,4985.313,These issues will impact this transfer and will require modifications authorizing the transfer.,178,,
903,0.97,4985.313,4998.159,"At the beginning of look at this legislation, the belief was that in addition to transferring the park, a few attractions would vacate Jefferson street.",178,,
904,0.97,4998.159,5002.297,We have sense determined that Dilling way is not a public street.,178,,
905,0.97,5002.297,5013.608,"Instead, it was designated as a private way by city council 85 years ago.",178,,
906,0.97,5013.608,5017.979,The private way designation will need to be vacated.,178,,
907,0.97,5017.979,5029.257,As Councilmember Mosqueda noted there's a request to ensure there's a new bike path that runs along Dilling way and that that bike path be maintained by the county if the transfer is approved.,178,,
908,0.97,5029.257,5039.467,And while Dilling way is not a public street it has been determined that there are alleys running through the city hall park that would need to be vacated.,178,,
909,0.97,5039.467,5044.906,And would need to be excluded from the property transferred to King county under this agreement.,178,,
910,0.97,5044.906,5054.549,So we need to still revise the Covenant language O reflect the current understanding of the property that would be transferred.,178,,
911,0.97,5054.549,5061.256,And will need to come to agreement with the county on that new Covenant language still.,178,,
912,0.97,5061.256,5082.577,"Once the Covenant language is finalized, it would be analyzed as part of the review and would be provided to an Appraiser who will conduct the requested appraisals on all of the properties involved in the property transfer.",178,,
913,0.97,5082.577,5096.691,"Central staff, particularly Tracy what is traveling today, working with parks & amp; recreation and the city attorney's office to sort of complete these steps.",178,,
914,0.97,5096.691,5097.625,Thank you.,179,,
915,0.97,5097.625,5103.264,"Tom, do you have something to add to that or is that a good summary that we can rest on?",179,,
916,0.97,5103.264,5103.798,That's fine.,180,,
917,0.97,5103.798,5124.118,"What I was going to say, this is part of your conversation, and I'm not the expert on I-4 2, but my understanding is the spirit of it is no loss of park use, no Net loss of park use.",180,,
918,0.97,5124.118,5147.742,"And with the language that you have before you and that continues to be refined, as we go along, I think what you are finding is that there's no loss of park use in the area of city hall park and there's additional Parcells that are added to the city's inventory and other areas.",180,,
919,0.97,5147.742,5149.644,With that I'll leave tout.,180,,
920,0.97,5149.644,5155.65,"Superintendent Williams, did you wanted to weigh in on this before we hear Councilmember Mosqueda's question?",181,,
921,0.97,5155.65,5163.057,Then I think it might be helpful to hear an overview of where the Covenant language is and maybe have a discussion about.,181,,
922,0.97,5163.057,5171.232,But I wanted to make sure we heard from you before we moved forward.,181,,
923,0.97,5171.232,5177.071,You bet.,182,,
924,0.97,5177.071,5207.635,"You think Councilmember Herbold captured my thoughts pretty well when she said you could wave or adopt all of the components of I-42, making a decision about fur going to meet the spirit and intent of I- 42, recognizing that some of the language is maybe not exactly applicable in terms of where the replacement properties are.",182,,
925,0.97,5207.635,5208.369,There's that question.,182,,
926,0.97,5208.369,5217.912,The other question that was raised was about Sifa.,182,,
927,0.97,5217.912,5223.217,It's our goal to do a process after we've concluded these conversations.,182,,
928,0.97,5223.217,5244.205,We want to do the checklist based on the final Covenant language and that's also roughly the same amount of time we'd be working on appraisals and the whole nine yards.,182,,
929,0.97,5244.205,5251.679,We certainly think that you've got some latitude in how you interpret I-42 and how you want to move forward.,182,,
930,0.97,5251.679,5253.014,Thank you for that.,183,,
931,0.97,5253.014,5263.257,"Councilmember Herbold, do you have a follow-up now that we've heard from everybody here on the panel?",183,,
932,0.97,5263.257,5269.597,I appreciate the answers about the question around the process and the Covenant.,184,,
933,0.97,5269.597,5275.77,I'm really glad to know that we're finalizing the language before the process.,184,,
934,0.97,5275.77,5279.641,I don't think that was decided when we met last in April.,184,,
935,0.97,5279.641,5283.177,And I think that's really important.,184,,
936,0.97,5283.177,5289.651,"If we want to make this argument, that the impacts are minimized, because of the commitments in the Covenant.",184,,
937,0.97,5289.651,5302.296,I don't think we could make that argument if we had to change the sequencing of the process.,184,,
938,0.97,5302.296,5311.272,"So really appreciate that, from what I understand is a shift, when we discussed back in April.",184,,
939,0.97,5311.272,5313.675,Not so much a follow-up but a restatement of my question.,184,,
940,0.97,5313.675,5321.883,I do want to know whether or not the other properties have received an appraisal.,184,,
941,0.97,5321.883,5327.522,And I think per Lisch's comments that will happen as part of the process.,185,,
942,0.97,5327.522,5332.16,"I'm sorry, if you said that I didn't hear that.",186,,
943,0.97,5332.16,5348.843,"Once we determine exactly what parts of city hall park actually are Parkland that would be transferred, then that will be appraised alongside all of the other properties.",187,,
944,0.97,5348.843,5349.21,Fantastic.,188,,
945,0.97,5349.21,5350.945,Thank you.,188,,
946,0.97,5350.945,5351.279,My apologies.,188,,
947,0.97,5351.279,5351.879,Council President Juarez.,189,,
948,0.97,5351.879,5357.151,"Can you correct me if I'm wrong, and Christopher, are you still on?",190,,
949,0.97,5357.151,5357.985,Yeah he.,191,,
950,0.97,5357.985,5370.898,"I seem to remember, I asked for analysis, and I got a number about how much those 13 Parcells were worth.",192,,
951,0.97,5370.898,5372.867,Did we not get a comparison?,192,,
952,0.97,5372.867,5373.334,"Go ahead, I'm sorry.",192,,
953,0.97,5373.334,5385.179,"I have not seen that, but it's possible that that may have existed under the previous administration and wasn't transmitted.",193,,
954,0.97,5385.179,5388.149,Were you working with us on this or was Tracy?,194,,
955,0.97,5388.149,5392.019,Tracy was--I got pulled in at the end of the year.,195,,
956,0.97,5392.019,5394.055,"Mr. Williams, Christopher, didn't we get a number?",196,,
957,0.97,5394.055,5398.96,Because I remember asking if we--and I just wanted a number.,196,,
958,0.97,5398.96,5401.362,I didn't want to wed anyone to it.,196,,
959,0.97,5401.362,5409.537,"I just wondered how much is the park worth, city hall Park, and then here's 13 properties.",196,,
960,0.97,5409.537,5410.838,Just a number.,196,,
961,0.97,5410.838,5416.878,I could have Sworks and I don't have my old files that we had a number.,196,,
962,0.97,5416.878,5417.645,"Did we, Christopher?",196,,
963,0.97,5417.645,5419.28,I don't recall a number.,197,,
964,0.97,5419.28,5430.324,I think what we provided was acreage comparison number.,197,,
965,0.97,5430.324,5436.23,So the best number we had was comparison of acreage to city hall park.,197,,
966,0.97,5436.23,5436.731,Okay.,198,,
967,0.97,5436.731,5439.434,So we had a comparison of acreage.,198,,
968,0.97,5439.434,5442.837,For some reason I thought we had fair mark value.,198,,
969,0.97,5442.837,5444.605,I may be confusing it.,198,,
970,0.97,5444.605,5445.006,I apologize.,198,,
971,0.97,5445.006,5450.244,I don't have my former analysis from when I was working on this with Tracy.,198,,
972,0.97,5450.244,5450.545,Thank you.,198,,
973,0.97,5450.545,5454.615,"Thank you, Mr. Claire.",198,,
974,0.97,5454.615,5456.317,"Thank you, Council President.",199,,
975,0.97,5456.317,5458.82,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you had a question before we move to the next topic.",199,,
976,0.97,5458.82,5461.022,"Thank you very much, Mr.",200,,
977,0.97,5461.022,5461.355,Chair.,200,,
978,0.97,5461.355,5466.561,"Actually, maybe just a Lead-In to the next topic, then I'll put myself back on mute.",200,,
979,0.97,5466.561,5492.753,"I really appreciate that we're going to get into the Covenant discussion now and on page 4 of the central staff memo it clearly says for the city hall park the Council commits that the city hall park will continue to be used for open public space, parks recreation and community facility, the expansion of the existing County facilities with public benefit providing any such purpose shall be used by the general public and primarily non commercial in nature.",200,,
980,0.97,5492.753,5516.677,"I think that's very much along the lines of what I and others had expressed earlier, and I heard it again from Councilmember Kohl-Welles, and it Aligns that there is a desire to be not only a public process but the public process that leads to using the space in Perpetuity as an open public park and that we activate the space.",200,,
981,0.97,5516.677,5521.315,And I also heard today that we ensure that there's resources.,200,,
982,0.97,5521.315,5527.655,"So Lisch, as we go into the next items, I'm just wondering if you, central staff, or Mr.",200,,
983,0.97,5527.655,5546.574,"Claire, it sounds like you've been working Onn there's anything else we need to add to this language because I think I take away from that open public space that there will be activation in that order to% activate, there will be resources and that we are relying on the county partners to continue upkeep and maintenance of this public space to.",200,,
984,0.97,5546.574,5552.28,"Your point, Mr. chair, the fences that are currently there will be taken down and it will truly be activated.",200,,
985,0.97,5552.28,5562.423,"I'm just wondering what more we might need to add, if anything, that really helps codify this.",200,,
986,0.97,5562.423,5569.096,"Yes, this will change, but we want this to remain in Perpetuity.",200,,
987,0.97,5569.096,5572.934,"I think the language looks good but look forward to getting to that next section, Mr. Claire.",200,,
988,0.97,5572.934,5581.309,Maybe it might be most fruitful to answer the questions by putting the language up and doing an overview.,201,,
989,0.97,5581.309,5584.745,I'm getting the sense from committee members that's the direction they want to go in.,201,,
990,0.97,5584.745,5589.617,So is it possible for us to put that up on the screen?,201,,
991,0.97,5589.617,5594.956,It's not a very long set of language.,201,,
992,0.97,5594.956,5598.659,So I think we could just share a screen and take a look at it.,201,,
993,0.97,5598.659,5606.701,I am not sure that I have what Councilmember Mosqueda is referring to.,202,,
994,0.97,5606.701,5615.009,It's the Covenant language that's currently undergoing Sipa.,203,,
995,0.97,5615.009,5617.278,My understanding is that still isn't finalized.,204,,
996,0.97,5617.278,5629.757,"I'm looking at page 4 of your memo, from the committee discussion on April 4TH.",205,,
997,0.97,5629.757,5649.977,"That is under development, and if Council members have input they'd like to provide on whether their future should be part of this Covenant, please he let Tracy know, and we will work with King County to make sure that it is incorporated.",206,,
998,0.97,5649.977,5664.759,And I'm stalling for time as I try to pull that up for you.,206,,
999,0.97,5671.332,5681.776,See if I can share my screen.,206,,
1000,0.97,5685.946,5690.051,I hope this is the right document.,206,,
1001,0.97,5690.051,5690.251,Yes.,206,,
1002,0.97,5690.251,5691.185,Can you see that?,206,,
1003,0.97,5691.185,5691.419,Yep.,207,,
1004,0.97,5691.419,5701.562,Yes.,208,,
1005,0.97,5702.363,5704.732,So this is the existing language.,208,,
1006,0.97,5704.732,5707.234,Let me zoom in a little bit more.,208,,
1007,0.97,5707.234,5719.246,"The county commits that city hall park will continue to be used for public open space, a park, recreation, community facility.",208,,
1008,0.97,5719.246,5736.73,"In discussions after the last Committee, this language has been narrowed to public open space or parks use, rather than another community facility or the expansion of County facilities.",208,,
1009,0.97,5736.73,5775.302,"So that's one change that you will see in the next draft of the Covenant, and there are additional changes related to the vacation of Jefferson Street and the alleys that would need to be vacated, and we still need to update the language, based on the new information about the status of Dilling way as a private--Dilling Street as a private way rather than a city street.",208,,
1010,0.97,5775.302,5795.189,I have a slightly more expansive set of language that was shared with us and that's been Deliberative Covenant language that's been shared with Stakeholders that is--this looks like a summary of that language.,209,,
1011,0.97,5795.189,5800.661,I don't know if the clerk could maybe figure out a way to share what I'm referring to.,209,,
1012,0.97,5800.661,5808.102,I'm looking at it right now on my computer.,209,,
1013,0.97,5808.102,5808.702,"Yes, Councilmember.",210,,
1014,0.97,5808.702,5816.01,"Lish, if you would stop sharing your screen, I think I have a copy of what the share is referring to.",210,,
1015,0.97,5816.01,5817.278,Thank you.,211,,
1016,0.97,5817.278,5825.619,"Knowing Councilmember Herbold, I think she really wants to really get into the guts of the full Covenant language.",212,,
1017,0.97,5825.619,5826.12,"Thanks, Mr. Claire.",213,,
1018,0.97,5826.12,5826.387,Yes.,214,,
1019,0.97,5826.387,5830.457,I hate to say this but I have to leave.,215,,
1020,0.97,5830.457,5833.594,"Well, it was really good to have you here.",216,,
1021,0.97,5833.594,5835.262,I'm really sorry about that.,217,,
1022,0.97,5835.262,5843.237,I know my staff is watching this on Seattle TV.,217,,
1023,0.97,5843.237,5849.944,I will be filled in by Karan as well.,217,,
1024,0.97,5849.944,5851.679,Thank you for joining us.,218,,
1025,0.97,5851.679,5854.081,It was really helpful.,218,,
1026,0.97,5854.081,5854.582,Thank you.,219,,
1027,0.97,5854.582,5856.75,I enjoyed it a lot.,219,,
1028,0.97,5856.75,5865.826,And I'm feeling very optimistic that we are going to come up with something better he than our King County Council envisioned.,219,,
1029,0.97,5865.826,5868.929,I appreciate all that you are doing.,219,,
1030,0.97,5868.929,5869.43,Thank you.,220,,
1031,0.97,5869.43,5869.93,There we go.,220,,
1032,0.97,5869.93,5884.044,"So Council members, members of the committee, this is the Deliberative Covenant language Jeff one can see this now, right?",220,,
1033,0.97,5884.044,5888.983,It's up on the screen.,220,,
1034,0.97,5888.983,5895.656,"As mentioned, this NARROWS the future use of the park to just public open space.",221,,
1035,0.97,5895.656,5915.342,"We need to update the language relate to Dilling way, but others this is where we are, and we need to add in the alleys as well as a future Street vacation action.",221,,
1036,0.97,5915.342,5923.217,If you could make sure this is distributed to committee members.,222,,
1037,0.97,5923.217,5929.423,"I was actually under the impression it had been distributed, but I guess I was Miss taken in thinking that.",222,,
1038,0.97,5929.423,5934.695,It doesn't sound like all committee members have access to this.,222,,
1039,0.97,5934.695,5949.677,"It should be posted as well to your agenda yes, Councilmember Herbold?",223,,
1040,0.97,5949.677,5967.328,I want to underscore the point that Councilmember Mosqueda was making around the resources necessary to operate and maintain the park in a manner consistent with its current use as a public park.,224,,
1041,0.97,5967.328,5971.365,I think that should be reflected as well.,224,,
1042,0.97,5971.365,5974.902,That seems appropriate.,224,,
1043,0.97,5974.902,5979.139,Like a defined resource commitment?,225,,
1044,0.97,5979.139,5999.226,"I don't have strong feelings that the actual number needs to be reflected in the Covenant, but I think some reference to the fact that there is an expectation for an activation budget that goes along with the Covenant.",226,,
1045,0.97,5999.226,6034.495,"I had shared with--and maybe our County partners what are still on the line here, Tom and Curran, I had proffered the possibility of language to the effect of a publicly available activation plan for the space, like there could Bea requirement that the county maintain a publicly available plan for activation programming.",227,,
1046,0.97,6034.495,6039.466,Something to that effect.,227,,
1047,0.97,6039.466,6047.274,"But, yes, I understand the point of what you're trying to get at, Councilmember Herbold, and I think there could be multiple ways to get there.",227,,
1048,0.97,6047.274,6061.588,But I don't know if Tom or Curran want to weigh in on that.,227,,
1049,0.97,6061.588,6065.159,It doesn't appear that they do at this time.,227,,
1050,0.97,6065.159,6067.494,I don't have any other questions for now.,227,,
1051,0.97,6067.494,6076.603,Maybe we could just pivot to talking about some process looking forward on where we might go on this.,227,,
1052,0.97,6076.603,6098.559,So the current plan would be to have a public hearing on this matter for August 3RD later this summer to give an opportunity for folks to weigh in as part of public process on this topic.,227,,
1053,0.97,6098.559,6110.971,"And that is the tentative date we have scheduled for that, which would be Wednesday, August 3RD.",227,,
1054,0.97,6110.971,6130.991,"And the Sipa Timeline, Lish kind of covered that, but I don't know--maybe if you could remind the committee when we would anticipate a response on a determination for the policy act checklist.",227,,
1055,0.97,6130.991,6148.942,"I do not know how long it will take parks to draft that determination once it's published, then there is a public comment period and a possibility of appeal.",228,,
1056,0.97,6148.942,6157.351,We are looking at a memo in a couple of months and probably longer for that process to play itself out.,228,,
1057,0.97,6157.351,6163.59,"Superintendent Williams, do you have any update on that.",229,,
1058,0.97,6163.59,6164.892,I think that's right.,230,,
1059,0.97,6164.892,6177.771,I think it's going to take us a little while to get appraisals and a final Sipa checklist completed.,230,,
1060,0.97,6177.771,6191.718,I would maybe hazard through the end of the year on appraisals and Sipa with the requirement for a hearing.,230,,
1061,0.97,6191.718,6192.152,Okay.,231,,
1062,0.97,6192.152,6197.991,"Well, if--I mean, if that's the Timeline, that's the Timeline.",231,,
1063,0.97,6197.991,6202.93,But we'll continue to coordinate with parks and with central staff.,231,,
1064,0.97,6202.93,6218.979,We did work on our end at the Council to come up with some tentative Covenant language which was that language that was just on the screen so that we could get that machinery in motion to start that Sipa process.,231,,
1065,0.97,6218.979,6227.788,So we'll continue to work with our executive side partners on getting that hurdle taken care of.,231,,
1066,0.97,6227.788,6237.931,Are there any other questions from committee members before we move on to our final agenda item of the afternoon?,231,,
1067,0.97,6237.931,6239.633,"Okay, seeing none --",231,,
1068,0.97,6239.633,6243.604,Mr. Claire?,232,,
1069,0.97,6243.604,6245.339,Is that Councilmember Mosqueda?,233,,
1070,0.97,6245.339,6245.606,Sorry.,234,,
1071,0.97,6245.606,6245.906,Mr. Claire?,234,,
1072,0.97,6245.906,6246.139,Yes.,235,,
1073,0.97,6246.139,6252.079,"I just wanted to say thank you to central staff and the folks who have put this together, because it's been going for so long.",236,,
1074,0.97,6252.079,6254.014,So thank you for all the work.,236,,
1075,0.97,6254.014,6264.658,I'm looking forward to working with the county and getting this transferred.,236,,
1076,0.97,6264.658,6265.058,Thank you.,237,,
1077,0.97,6265.058,6266.493,"Oh, thank you so much.",238,,
1078,0.97,6266.493,6269.096,It doesn't look like there's any additional comments.,238,,
1079,0.97,6269.096,6271.365,I think that's a good one to end it on.,238,,
1080,0.97,6271.365,6275.068,"So thank you, everybody, for joining us from the county.",238,,
1081,0.97,6275.068,6283.076,Appreciate your partnership on this and being so generous with your time this afternoon.,238,,
1082,0.97,6283.076,6287.214,We look forward to continuing this discussion on August 3RD when we will after public hearing.,238,,
1083,0.97,6287.214,6293.353,Look forward to hearing from the community on August 3RD on this topic.,238,,
1084,0.97,6293.353,6299.359,"Moving on, Mr. Claire, will you please read our final agenda item into the record.",238,,
1085,0.97,6299.359,6303.864,"Item 3, Seattle parks Aquatics update.",239,,
1086,0.97,6303.864,6307.567,Thank you.,240,,
1087,0.97,6307.567,6313.273,We are now joined by Michelle Finnegan and superintendent Williams from Seattle parks & amp; recreation.,240,,
1088,0.97,6313.273,6332.626,"Just to Cue this up and do a little bit of table setting, it was in the news last month that Seattle is experiencing a very acute shortage of lifeguards just at the time when we need lifeguards most in the summer.",240,,
1089,0.97,6332.626,6350.977,"I believe that the average number that we've expected in the past of 420 lifeguards is down to something like 200 lifeguards, and it is starting to become a Covid era consistent labor shortage issue.",240,,
1090,0.97,6350.977,6369.429,"So I felt, given the coverage and the timing, that it would warrant a public hearing for us to talk a little bit more with parks & amp; recreation about steps forward and how to adjust our strategy on this issue, given that it's likely next summer we'll continue to have similar challenges around Lifeguarding.",240,,
1091,0.97,6369.429,6375.135,I did also just want to start by way of a little bit more table setting.,240,,
1092,0.97,6375.135,6386.513,"I had someone on my staff, Malik on my staff, go and find the second floor's addition of the economist this week.",240,,
1093,0.97,6386.513,6402.462,"There's an article in the issue, July 2ND, 2022, titled ""where have all the lifeguards gone"" about the National United States shortage of Lifeguarding.",240,,
1094,0.97,6402.462,6418.178,And it cites in the body of that article that a poll in May by the National recreation park Association found that only 12% of park and recreation leaders were fully staffed on lifeguards for the summer.,240,,
1095,0.97,6418.178,6422.649,So we're no exception in this national trend.,240,,
1096,0.97,6422.649,6434.327,We are part of that 88% that is experiencing a staffing issue with lifeguards that is Impacting our ability to fully staff the Aquatic offering Vtion parks & amp; recreation.,240,,
1097,0.97,6434.327,6450.744,And with that table setting I'm excited to introduce our parks and Rec panel and talk about ways we might work together as a legislative branch in the parks Department to reverse that trend and make sure all of our Aquatic recreation centers can remain open and fully staffed.,240,,
1098,0.97,6450.744,6455.615,"So, with that I will turn it over to superintendent Williams.",240,,
1099,0.97,6455.615,6456.516,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",241,,
1100,0.97,6456.516,6460.787,And thank you for calling out that economist article.,241,,
1101,0.97,6460.787,6466.526,You actually saved Maybe the first two minutes of my presentation.,241,,
1102,0.97,6466.526,6467.828,So I really appreciate that.,241,,
1103,0.97,6467.828,6487.414,"You're right this is a national trend, and part of it has to do with what young people view as kind of acceptable employment, Post-Pandemic.",241,,
1104,0.97,6487.414,6489.816,Lifeguarding requires a lot of in-depth training.,241,,
1105,0.97,6489.816,6497.757,It is actually saving lives during a Water-Related situation.,241,,
1106,0.97,6497.757,6500.026,These are not plug and play staff.,241,,
1107,0.97,6500.026,6506.967,"By way of example, the majority of our Aquatics staff are Temp staff.",241,,
1108,0.97,6506.967,6515.775,"This is a classification of employees who may be received the most training, more so than any other group of temporary employees across the city.",241,,
1109,0.97,6515.775,6520.814,It's a very specialized body of work.,241,,
1110,0.97,6520.814,6526.186,So thank you for the opportunity to discuss the whole Lifeguard situation.,241,,
1111,0.97,6526.186,6529.389,Why don't we go to the next slide there.,241,,
1112,0.97,6529.389,6531.591,I don't see the presentation.,241,,
1113,0.97,6531.591,6539.366,We've got a Powerpoint presentation but I'm not seeing it on the screen here.,241,,
1114,0.97,6539.366,6549.776,"Michelle, are you sharing the screen, or someone sharing our Powerpoint presentation?",241,,
1115,0.97,6549.776,6550.777,I can't.,242,,
1116,0.97,6550.777,6554.281,I had thought the clerk's office was going to but I can.,242,,
1117,0.97,6554.281,6554.547,Okay.,243,,
1118,0.97,6554.547,6558.685,That would be great if you could share the screen.,243,,
1119,0.97,6558.685,6569.729,"So while Michelle is bringing up the screen, a little bit more about our Aquatics program.",243,,
1120,0.97,6569.729,6575.235,We operate a huge inventory of Aquatic opportunities across the Department.,243,,
1121,0.97,6575.235,6581.241,"Let's go to that next slide, Michele.",243,,
1122,0.97,6581.241,6581.474,Thanks.,243,,
1123,0.97,6581.474,6587.781,Slide 2. so here you can see we have a $9.3 million budget.,243,,
1124,0.97,6587.781,6589.95,About 65% of.,243,,
1125,0.97,6589.95,6596.022,"Budget is revenue generated, fee for access to public pools.",244,,
1126,0.97,6596.022,6597.657,We have about 50 FTE.,244,,
1127,0.97,6597.657,6601.227,We have a huge indoor pool system with eight pools.,244,,
1128,0.97,6601.227,6610.203,"We have two outdoor pools, one locate on Queen Anne, and the other at Coleman park.",244,,
1129,0.97,6610.203,6619.813,The pool at Coleman Park is a Saltwater movement we're operating six of nine Lifeguarded beaches across the city this year.,244,,
1130,0.97,6619.813,6625.785,"They include Madison Beach, Madrona Beach, Magnuson Beach, Pritchard Beach, and West green Lake Beach.",244,,
1131,0.97,6625.785,6640.767,"And our goal here was to try to create some geographic equity across the city so that no matter where you live, you've got access within a reasonable distance to a publicly guarded swimming Beach.",244,,
1132,0.97,6640.767,6646.306,We're also operating 20 out of 22 Wading pools.,244,,
1133,0.97,6646.306,6658.385,"Ironically, the same challenge exists with hiring enough Temp staff to work at our Wading pools, even though they require a different skill set than Lifeguarding a beach.",244,,
1134,0.97,6658.385,6661.855,"We've got boat launches, spray parks across the system.",244,,
1135,0.97,6661.855,6675.402,So with that I'd also like to recognize our Aquatics staff for their creative solution making and finding solutions to work around what is clearly been a staff shortage.,244,,
1136,0.97,6675.402,6687.981,They've come up with some creative solutions and have been managed--have managed to provide all of this access during a time when we are significantly constrained with staffing.,244,,
1137,0.97,6687.981,6692.919,"So in some ways, this team has made lemonade out of lemons.",244,,
1138,0.97,6692.919,6705.698,"But we're wanting to share with you what we believe is a good so with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Plympton, who is our Aquatics manager.",244,,
1139,0.97,6705.698,6706.566,"Thank you, Christopher.",245,,
1140,0.97,6706.566,6713.273,"Michele, if we could bring up the next slide.",245,,
1141,0.97,6713.273,6728.688,"So what we're owe what I'm going to kind of walk you through and what the slide shows is really from March 2020 with the Covid shutdown of our services, where we--kind of the steps we've gone to and the things that have happened between then and now.",245,,
1142,0.97,6728.688,6729.422,So between this summer.,245,,
1143,0.97,6729.422,6733.46,In March 2020 all of our public pools closed.,245,,
1144,0.97,6733.46,6737.464,The city Pat hiring Freezen place.,245,,
1145,0.97,6737.464,6741.167,And staff were Pivoted to what we refer to as essential services.,245,,
1146,0.97,6741.167,6749.342,So Pivoted out of act a squat Tykes serve elsewhere in the recreation division and SPR.,245,,
1147,0.97,6749.342,6752.245,In summer 2020 we were able to reopen five beaches.,245,,
1148,0.97,6752.245,6761.821,"We were able to hire a few staff, despite the hiring freeze to maintain a level of leadership at our outdoor beaches.",245,,
1149,0.97,6761.821,6779.172,"So again a it was a very short summer for us but it was with Covid protocols in place to limit crowding to keep staff safe, and to increase the safety for both Lifeguard staff and for the--for folks who wanted to cool off in the summer.",245,,
1150,0.97,6779.172,6786.88,"In fall of 20 20, we moved into taking an important step of Recertifying our Lifeguard staff.",245,,
1151,0.97,6786.88,6791.05,"So at this point, rung Lifeguard classes was not an option, based on restrictions.",245,,
1152,0.97,6791.05,6798.057,"We did have safety plans that were put in place and approved, to be able to Recertify our current team.",245,,
1153,0.97,6798.057,6800.26,A Recertification is about an Eight-Hour class has.,245,,
1154,0.97,6800.26,6811.838,To happen every two years as opposed to a new Lifeguard certification that's a 30-Hour training program W. Covid restrictions that was a challenge for a little while.,245,,
1155,0.97,6811.838,6834.994,"Fast-Forwarding, we opened two pools in the winter of 2021 with Rainier Beach opening up, then took that into summer where we were able to reopen six of our beaches as well as 11 Wading pools and two outdoor pools, Coleman and Monger.",245,,
1156,0.97,6834.994,6836.062,That was summer 2021.,245,,
1157,0.97,6836.062,6840.5,We were able to expand on the amenities.,245,,
1158,0.97,6840.5,6841.467,With that came additional staffing.,245,,
1159,0.97,6841.467,6858.084,"We moved forward into fall, we closed our outdoor facilities and opened up our four additional indoor pools with modified schedules and began offering Lifeguard certification classes to the public.",245,,
1160,0.97,6858.084,6859.452,With Covid protocols in place.,245,,
1161,0.97,6859.452,6862.121,So a safe version with Covid present from.,245,,
1162,0.97,6862.121,6877.704,There we moved forward into winter 2020 and opened seven of our eight indoor pools on a modified schedule and maintained until the Vend spring when we Transitioned to summer.,245,,
1163,0.97,6877.704,6891.451,"We had to close a couple of pools but have maintained five as well as two outdoor pools, six beaches, and as Christopher Williams mentioned, 20 of 22 Wading pools.",245,,
1164,0.97,6891.451,6903.463,So with this it's really a gradual Ramping up of service and basically a focus on trying to help us--trying to help us grow our team into the future.,245,,
1165,0.97,6903.463,6904.464,We're growing through the summer.,245,,
1166,0.97,6904.464,6905.732,We are growing into the fall.,245,,
1167,0.97,6905.732,6909.335,With that is going to come 18 addressed service as we continue to move forward.,245,,
1168,0.97,6909.335,6920.113,We can take it to the next slide.,245,,
1169,0.97,6920.113,6925.218,"So our staffing levels, we're going to talk about Ramp-Up.",245,,
1170,0.97,6925.218,6934.427,We Have200 temporary staff that operate with about just under 50 FTE of regular staffing.,245,,
1171,0.97,6934.427,6940.166,When we go into summer we grow our staff by about 200.,245,,
1172,0.97,6940.166,6944.504,"That starts, in a normal Pre- Covid year, in about February.",245,,
1173,0.97,6944.504,6949.309,With that we've got our Beach program that is predominantly temporary.,245,,
1174,0.97,6949.309,6953.313,There's one benefited staff person that acts as a supervisor.,246,,
1175,0.97,6953.313,6961.788,"We have 18 temporary young leaders that lead these sites and supervise these sites, the nine different beaches that we have.",246,,
1176,0.97,6961.788,6969.362,And we have a cadre of about 80 Beach lifeguards that are there that are spread out through these nine sites when we're in full operation.,246,,
1177,0.97,6969.362,6988.614,"So the safety training that these folks go through, so on top of the certification, the 30-Hour certification, in order to work at the beach they have about 20 additional hours of training, as well as the folks that we have that work at the pool that have additional training in teaching swimming lessons.",246,,
1178,0.97,6988.614,6989.382,They're not all interchangeable.,246,,
1179,0.97,6989.382,6994.487,"Folks are able to work supporting certain aspect of our operation, and they're all meeting a critical need.",246,,
1180,0.97,6994.487,6998.224,So those indoor pools are teaching swimming lessons.,246,,
1181,0.97,6998.224,7016.576,"They're providing water access to seniors to very young people, to the disabled, and we're providing that access, and we're providing that education and those swimming skills to help feed our future employees and to help keep folks safe as a part of a drowning prevention strategy.",246,,
1182,0.97,7016.576,7027.887,"So with that, it was mentioned we do have a reduced site selection so we were only able to open six of our nine beaches this summer.",246,,
1183,0.97,7027.887,7057.717,"Part of the decision making, we looked at past attendance to look at how many folks use those sites, considered equity as well as site characteristics like the presence of Diving boards, the presence of piers that come out from the shore, the slope of the beach, things that create--that make risks harder to manage without having lifeguards there.",246,,
1184,0.97,7057.717,7068.661,"As a part of that, what we're looking at is there are a number of concerns with what sites to open.",246,,
1185,0.97,7068.661,7088.214,"We mentioned--I mentioned the amenities, attraction of teens is a big risk management point with drowning prevention, because teens are risktakers, and if we have amenities at our sites to bring them in, that serves as keeping them swimming at a safer place in the summer.",246,,
1186,0.97,7088.214,7090.983,So that's a bit about our decision making process.,246,,
1187,0.97,7090.983,7096.456,"I guess we can take it to the next slide, Michele.",246,,
1188,0.97,7096.456,7110.67,So this slide speaks to the--both the National Lifeguard shortage as well as the National labor shortage in Front-Facing workers.,246,,
1189,0.97,7110.67,7132.758,"We are facing critical staffing shortage along with many industries with Lifeguarding, what we are up against, one of the challenges that we've had is on top of the line shortage, on top of all the jobs that are available to frontline workers, the National shortage of lifeguards is there because of the lack of training for several years, the lack of our own staff development.",246,,
1190,0.97,7132.758,7143.369,"We've got some level of permanent staff of benefited staff that are available, and leadership staff that have worked in our system and have the skills to take the lead.",246,,
1191,0.97,7143.369,7147.24,But we've lost a couple of years of development in that time.,246,,
1192,0.97,7147.24,7157.183,"So we are short kind of in that experience level, and that is what is making it challenging for us to safely open all of our sites.",246,,
1193,0.97,7157.183,7160.786,"We are growing our team, training people all the time.",246,,
1194,0.97,7160.786,7163.723,We're looking forward to continuing to grow into next summer.,246,,
1195,0.97,7163.723,7175.935,"One of the challenges that was touched on earlier, we have a lower wage than many unskilled service jobs, than many entry level service jobs.",246,,
1196,0.97,7175.935,7202.528,"So for the same--for not much different of a wage than one might make working at a Fast- food restaurant or starting at a grocery store, you could end up--the work as a Lifeguard you end up having to go and take this certification class, commit your own time, have the swimming skills to get there, and then to be able to step in and the willingness to step into that role with that responsibility.",246,,
1197,0.97,7202.528,7205.698,So that is the--the wage is a barrier.,246,,
1198,0.97,7205.698,7215.007,"Our Lifeguard rate of pay moved, over the last 10 years, from about 67% above minimum wage to about 13% above minimum wage.",246,,
1199,0.97,7215.007,7218.711,So that's how it's gone in the last 10 years in relation to this.,246,,
1200,0.97,7218.711,7227.286,"And that speaks to the need for training, and it speaks to the challenge of finding folks that are willing to step into that role.",246,,
1201,0.97,7227.286,7241.934,"With that is also that weave lost folks throughout the pandemic who have moved to other positions, and we haven't been able to recoup the staff we've lost at the same rate.",246,,
1202,0.97,7241.934,7257.35,"That, as a frame of reference and our benefited positions, we've moved from 16 of 26 indoor pools, senior lifeguards last September to 12 of 26 spots that are filled in May.",246,,
1203,0.97,7257.35,7261.988,"So despite hiring, we've actually moved in the wrong direction in terms of total numbers.",246,,
1204,0.97,7261.988,7264.19,So it's just a frame of reference.,246,,
1205,0.97,7264.19,7266.325,So we are continuing to work on it.,246,,
1206,0.97,7266.325,7268.894,The rate of pay has been a barrier.,246,,
1207,0.97,7268.894,7275.868,"I'll take it to the next slide, please, Michelle.",246,,
1208,0.97,7275.868,7279.105,"So Lifeguard requirements, as we mentioned, recruitment.",246,,
1209,0.97,7279.105,7284.11,So lifeguards to work for SPR have to be 16 years of age.,246,,
1210,0.97,7284.11,7304.964,"They have to pass a preemployment background check, an American Red Cross Lifeguard course, which is a 30-Hour course, as well as passing a Northwest Lifeguard test, additional training for Beach lifeguards is another 20 hours of on-site training to be able to step into that role.",246,,
1211,0.97,7304.964,7314.04,Additional training for pool lifeguards involves about a comparable number of hours to teach swimming lessons effectively and to be able to step into the Roims those jobs.,246,,
1212,0.97,7314.04,7325.584,All of those things and then moving into a leadership position requires familiarity with the system and the experience to make good decisions in those roles.,246,,
1213,0.97,7325.584,7327.386,We've add large recruitment effort.,246,,
1214,0.97,7327.386,7337.963,"We worked on advertising on social media, the city Website, Washington recreation and parks Association, as well as drowning prevention groups, like the Washington state drowning prevention nets work.",246,,
1215,0.97,7337.963,7346.038,We've done outreach through high school swim teams and through swim team groups due to the swimming skills that come inherent with those groups.,246,,
1216,0.97,7346.038,7359.151,"We have advertised and conducted 14 Lifeguard classes since the beginning of the year and are still at that deficit point, despite this.",246,,
1217,0.97,7359.151,7361.12,"So, those recruitment efforts are our next city.",246,,
1218,0.97,7361.12,7365.224,We're running teen programs and looking to connect with young people.,246,,
1219,0.97,7365.224,7369.729,"But with that, it has been a challenge.",246,,
1220,0.97,7369.729,7373.466,"However, we are continuing to grow, as was mentioned.",246,,
1221,0.97,7373.466,7383.309,"So let's take it to our next slide, please.",246,,
1222,0.97,7383.309,7389.115,"Strategies we've had, we are looking toward both the short term and the long term solution for the wage issue.",246,,
1223,0.97,7389.115,7400.559,We're looking for a longer term wage review by Partnering with Seattle Department of human resources as well as a near term solution of hiring staff at a hire step rate.,246,,
1224,0.97,7400.559,7406.532,So at a higher rate of pay based on the current steps that exist within the series.,246,,
1225,0.97,7406.532,7408.701,And then considering other ideas.,246,,
1226,0.97,7408.701,7414.874,Maybe I'll jump in here.,247,,
1227,0.97,7414.874,7415.408,Go ahead.,248,,
1228,0.97,7415.408,7424.45,"Councilmember Lewis, I want to recognize your idea of a Lifeguard auxiliary and really appreciate the energy in which you have leaned into this problem.",249,,
1229,0.97,7424.45,7426.752,We did take a look at that.,249,,
1230,0.97,7426.752,7448.574,"And one of the hurdles we've run into is that while police and fire both have water safety classifications, the employees in those roles earned considerably more dollars per hour than our $22 an hour Lifeguard maybe, right?",249,,
1231,0.97,7448.574,7470.629,"I think just think about from a labor standpoint having a person making $150 in overtime hours next to a person who is making $22 an hour doing the same job seemed like a huge wage despair he tee, labor issue that we want to Delve more deeply into.",249,,
1232,0.97,7470.629,7479.438,But I did want to acknowledge and thank you for leaning into this problem and for providing some suggestions.,249,,
1233,0.97,7479.438,7485.678,So we wanted you to know that we did explore the idea.,249,,
1234,0.97,7485.678,7487.213,"Superintendent, I appreciate that.",250,,
1235,0.97,7487.213,7495.254,"My colleagues might be confused, because I don't think I've publicly talked about this idea.",250,,
1236,0.97,7495.254,7526.986,"I did send an Email, given that we have a lot of city employees that we have Emt Certifications or other such Certifications, and what I had proffered as a possible idea is offering optional overtime slots if there are city employees that have appropriate certification and would be interested in accepting Cross-Departmental floated opportunities to take ot.",250,,
1237,0.97,7526.986,7535.694,I understand why that would potentially not be practicable.,250,,
1238,0.97,7535.694,7564.123,"If, going forward, we are looking for ways to Incentivize and encourage people to keep up their Certifications, or if there's people within the city family who used to be lifeguards and have Out-Of-Date Certifications that they could renew, the fact that lifeguards are not organized to my understanding, there isn't a Union for lifeguards, that's potentially an opportunity for someone to organize that workforce.",250,,
1239,0.97,7564.123,7566.392,"But at the moment, they're not organized.",250,,
1240,0.97,7566.392,7582.174,"I would think we would have flexibility to offer other city employees, if they do have certification, to potentially take that opportunity to take an O.T.",250,,
1241,0.97,7582.174,7590.282,"Slot, if it's during a time they wouldn't otherwise be he working.",250,,
1242,0.97,7590.282,7597.189,"But I just wanted to daylight that, if colleagues or Council is confused.",250,,
1243,0.97,7597.189,7599.692,But appreciate that answer in the session today.,250,,
1244,0.97,7599.692,7610.836,"And just to clarify, Councilmember Lewis, local 242 does represent our permanent part-time lifeguards and our senior lifeguards.",251,,
1245,0.97,7610.836,7617.443,"And, therefore, the temporary lifeguards fall under the bargaining agreements related to temporary staff.",251,,
1246,0.97,7617.443,7622.982,"So there would also be--they are represented, just to clarify.",251,,
1247,0.97,7622.982,7628.22,"Sorry, I was not aware of.",252,,
1248,0.97,7628.22,7628.621,Okayg to know.,252,,
1249,0.97,7628.621,7629.088,Never mind.,252,,
1250,0.97,7629.088,7629.288,Okay.,252,,
1251,0.97,7629.288,7634.059,"Sorry, I cut off the presentation, superintendent Williams.",252,,
1252,0.97,7634.059,7634.593,Turn it back over to you.,252,,
1253,0.97,7634.593,7638.697,I'll just turn it back over to Mike Plympton.,253,,
1254,0.97,7638.697,7640.466,We're almost done.,254,,
1255,0.97,7640.466,7672.898,"So the main thing, next step, other than looking at a wage related issues, we're looking towards what we can do to get our feeding programs back in play as for this we're talking about we have a summer program called the Lifeguard training team that operates out of our Beach program that serves as a feeder that's a free teen program as well as one that we have going on at Rainier Beach community center and pool through late night, through partnership with our late night program.",254,,
1256,0.97,7672.898,7684.143,These are--they are feeder programs to both help get teens in but tolls generate potential future staff and to help get folks into the pipeline into that pipeline we referred to.,254,,
1257,0.97,7684.143,7699.191,"So beyond that we also will be--we're bringing back our lesson program that has been expanding, and with that comes the opportunity to be a swim aide and to learn those swimming lesson skills.",254,,
1258,0.97,7699.191,7718.143,"Can I ask, if someone wanted to sign up to serve in this capacity with all of the Certifications you need to go through and the Trainingr there ways to--does the city pay for that or do you have to pay for that out of your own pocket and then you get the job?",255,,
1259,0.97,7718.143,7728.22,So we are offering currently--we have a special program this year that we are--hopefully will be continuing to offer free Lifeguard training.,256,,
1260,0.97,7728.22,7739.331,The time isn't paid so staff--people are trained on their own time and then continue with a hiring process after they complete the course.,256,,
1261,0.97,7739.331,7747.506,But the city does pay for the fees associated with certification?,257,,
1262,0.97,7747.506,7747.739,Yes.,258,,
1263,0.97,7747.739,7752.845,Okay.,259,,
1264,0.97,7752.845,7759.017,Are there other questions from Council colleagues?,260,,
1265,0.97,7759.017,7763.222,Couple questions.,261,,
1266,0.97,7763.222,7780.239,"One, going back to the reference to Covid precautions, just curious whether or not you have capacity restrictions as any of the pools in place that are driven by Covid safety concerns for patients and staff.",261,,
1267,0.97,7780.239,7789.715,"So any of our capacity restrictions right now are based on staffing level, not on Covid restrictions.",262,,
1268,0.97,7789.715,7792.584,Got it.,263,,
1269,0.97,7792.584,7798.724,My other question relates to the staffing Ramp-Up strategy.,263,,
1270,0.97,7798.724,7807.232,I understand that the long-term strategy is the wage study work that you're doing.,263,,
1271,0.97,7807.232,7820.145,But you reference always Near- term strategy and that Near- term strategy I guess would be allowing hiring at a higher starting rate.,263,,
1272,0.97,7820.145,7831.59,"I'm wondering, would that also require retroactive increases for lifeguards who are currently employees?",263,,
1273,0.97,7831.59,7836.161,So let me see here the best way to answer this.,264,,
1274,0.97,7836.161,7851.243,"So for short term, we are hiring new employees at--and they're also going to be looking at previously hired employees to get them to the same step to a higher pay step to start as temporary lifeguards.",264,,
1275,0.97,7851.243,7853.779,Say that one more time.,265,,
1276,0.97,7853.779,7856.849,Both new and current employees.,266,,
1277,0.97,7856.849,7858.25,Are going to be receiving --,267,,
1278,0.97,7858.25,7860.686,The higher rate of pay.,268,,
1279,0.97,7860.686,7861.32,Got it.,269,,
1280,0.97,7861.32,7869.294,Because we have a few different departments in the city that are struggling with filling vacancies.,269,,
1281,0.97,7869.294,7891.283,"I want to make sure when we're trying to address that, creating strategies to bring more people in to fill these vacancies that we're not inadvertently creating morale issues for the current city workforce.",269,,
1282,0.97,7891.283,7896.755,I think that's an important element of our recruitment strategies in all of our departments.,269,,
1283,0.97,7896.755,7897.356,So thank you.,269,,
1284,0.97,7897.356,7898.056,Absolutely.,270,,
1285,0.97,7898.056,7898.69,"Thank you, Councilmember.",271,,
1286,0.97,7898.69,7912.371,"One thing I might throw out there, too, I had the privilege this morning of meeting with some representatives from AMR, the folks that run our Emt program.",272,,
1287,0.97,7912.371,7955.781,"And one of the things they indicated is they have a program a where folks that are seeking their certification to be Emts, they do pay them during that time that they're learning while pursuing their certification, and maybe that might be an area for us to pursue if that is currently not compensated time, given the length--the extensive length to get certified, from the earlier slide it looked like 35 hours of work and training to get the certification.",272,,
1288,0.97,7955.781,7978.704,And maybe that would be an area to consider if that time not being compensated for is a barrier for entry for some people who might otherwise be interested in pursuing this opportunity.,272,,
1289,0.97,7978.704,7981.974,"Councilmember Lewis, that's a great point.",273,,
1290,0.97,7981.974,7986.845,"And, yes, the time, paid training, and that is something that's a barrier for folks.",273,,
1291,0.97,7986.845,7989.047,That is always going to be a barrier.,273,,
1292,0.97,7989.047,7997.622,So the ability to pay staff to take the training or pay prospective staff to take the training would be a great step forward.,273,,
1293,0.97,7997.622,8004.696,"Could I ask about the recruitment in high schools, like with high school swim teams?",274,,
1294,0.97,8004.696,8008.133,Has the momentum for that been knocked down during Covid?,274,,
1295,0.97,8008.133,8016.608,How is the tempo of that recruitment gone relative to how it's been in previous years?,274,,
1296,0.97,8016.608,8025.35,And does that represent a big percentage of the seasonal people that do this work?,274,,
1297,0.97,8025.35,8042.067,"You know, the connection with those groups, when they're in there for swim season, I think the big push for us is that there is a connection before the end of their swim season to make contact with the team to potentially set up a class with many members of that team.",275,,
1298,0.97,8042.067,8056.448,Sought hasn't changed as much during Covid as the--the interest in pursuing a job or pursuing a training where you are having to get in close personal space of other people.,275,,
1299,0.97,8056.448,8059.651,That has probably been the biggest impact.,275,,
1300,0.97,8059.651,8074.733,"Not as much on the teens themselves or the swimmers themselves, because they're already doing that sort of thing, but in the general public to say, I'm really interested in doing this, knowing that I'm going to have to be right in someone's space, and because of Covid, I'm not comfortable with that right now.",275,,
1301,0.97,8074.733,8078.67,"That's kind of the bigger impact, if that makes sense.",275,,
1302,0.97,8078.67,8083.241,"Yes, that makes perfect 70s.",276,,
1303,0.97,8083.241,8085.811,Thank you for clarifying that.,276,,
1304,0.97,8085.811,8092.083,I'm going to open it up again if colleagues have any questions for our panel on this.,276,,
1305,0.97,8092.083,8123.281,"I would be Remiss if I didn't mention that this does also seem like a ripe area for exploration if there are ongoing strategies that might require supplemental resources as part of our metropolitan park district discussions, I think it would fall within the scope of figuring out how we can program and equip our Aquatics personnel Strat goes to adapt to the changing labor market and changing circumstances that are live.",276,,
1306,0.97,8123.281,8127.919,Ing the public's access to these facilities.,276,,
1307,0.97,8127.919,8132.357,My door is open to continue to have that conversation.,276,,
1308,0.97,8132.357,8149.307,I will also just add that I really do appreciate the triage work of Seattle parks and of the Aquatics division in really making sure that we're keeping as many facilities open as we are during these summer months.,276,,
1309,0.97,8149.307,8159.05,"You shared that story from Phoenix, Arizona, which is closing half of their Aquatic facilities due to their shortage.",276,,
1310,0.97,8159.05,8167.959,"So the adaptability and the mitigate under intense pressure is very admirable, and I really appreciate the leadership of this team and making that happen.",276,,
