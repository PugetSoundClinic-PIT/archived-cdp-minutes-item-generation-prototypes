113,0.97,552.218,556.122,Really your outstanding commitment to making sure that the workers on the front line have the services they need.,26,,
114,0.97,556.122,570.536,You responded to those services by making sure that people who had signed up to provide public service through libraries had additional resources to take on the challenges that libraries were observing.,26,,
115,0.97,570.536,587.753,"Recognizing that you all have stood up in many ways to serve our centers when we should be offering more housing and day services across our city, that your libraries ended up being that resource and wanted to make sure that people working in the libraries felt safe and they have resources to refer people to.",26,,
116,0.97,587.753,594.393,"So, I just remember the way in which you talked about those who work in libraries needing access to resources to provide youth with the services they need.",26,,
117,0.97,594.393,612.178,"Connections to housing, making sure they felt safe and the way you center to work on what the workers were experiencing really was a tremendous, truly impressive, and what a cool way to have a Councilmember Juarez with this offer.",26,,
118,0.97,612.178,616.182,Happy to be here and look forward to continuing to celebrate you in your next adventure.,26,,
119,0.97,616.182,619.585,"Bin colleagues, any other comments?",26,,
120,0.97,619.585,631.063,"I would also echo deep gratitude to you, mt for your service to the city.",27,,
121,0.97,631.063,647.513,I think one of the things that I've really appreciated about you is just your honesty and your earnest desire to always be such a strong servant leader for those who need access the most to our public libraries.,27,,
122,0.97,647.513,650.716,That came through for me in a couple of ways that we got to work together.,27,,
123,0.97,650.716,655.621,"One was on expanding the literacy program and, particularly for non-English speakers at the library.",27,,
124,0.97,655.621,676.142,"To be able to Bake that into the existing library levy to make sure that there is a actual stream of revenue going into those really popular literacy programs that teach parents how to be better parents, and kids how to read and connect with each other.",27,,
125,0.97,676.142,690.556,That will leave I think a really long lasting legacy for our younger listeners and for their parents who really rely on those services to improve the lives of their families.,27,,
126,0.97,690.556,692.825,I want to thank you for your support of that effort.,27,,
127,0.97,692.825,703.769,"Then, the other wonderful memory I have of being able to connect with you is when we were down at the South Park library with like about 20 kids.",27,,
128,0.97,703.769,705.371,This was in Pre-Covid times.,27,,
129,0.97,705.371,707.073,This was not recent.,27,,
130,0.97,707.073,717.85,"To have them experiment with robotics and using our library in creative ways, not just for reading.",27,,
131,0.97,717.85,718.584,Not just for studying.,27,,
132,0.97,718.584,725.491,"Not just for learning, but for hands-on experimentation in learning and being sort of captured in that moment.",27,,
133,0.97,725.491,730.996,By the innovation of those little robots.,27,,
134,0.97,730.996,732.598,While still enjoying their public library.,27,,
135,0.97,732.598,734.2,It was a real joy.,27,,
136,0.97,734.2,749.081,"Just a Testament to the innovator that you are, and how you think about libraries really belonging to the community and belonging to the people who live in those communities Charlotte is very lucky to have you.",27,,
137,0.97,749.081,751.484,We were lucky to have you for as long as we did.,27,,

139,0.97,760.826,763.496,"Thank you for your service, mt.",27,,
140,0.97,763.496,770.603,"Councilmember Juarez, did you want to make remarks now or after mt speaks?",27,,
141,0.97,770.603,772.037,I will let mt speak.,28,,
142,0.97,772.037,774.24,Okay folks.,29,,
143,0.97,774.24,780.546,I'm going to ask that the rules be suspended so that we can hear from our guest of honor.,29,,
144,0.97,780.546,783.149,"If there is no objection, the Council's rules are suspended.",29,,
145,0.97,783.149,784.55,Inside.,29,,
146,0.97,784.55,790.923,To allow Marcellus Turner to accept the proclamation and provide remarks.,29,,
147,0.97,790.923,798.831,"Hearing no objections, the Council rules are suspended and mt, welcome again to the city council meeting.",29,,

151,0.97,805.538,812.244,"So many things I don't want to start leaving out, so I'll start without things I don't want to leave out.",30,,

155,0.97,818.15,819.752,I have fingers crossed and everything hoping for that.,30,,
156,0.97,819.752,821.787,Thank you for that.,30,,
157,0.97,821.787,825.858,"David, that was a surprise.",30,,
158,0.97,825.858,826.859,That was a big surprise.,30,,
159,0.97,826.859,830.196,I looked at him and I said that really looks like David.,30,,
160,0.97,830.196,832.798,I wonder what they are doing with him in that Screenshots.,30,,
161,0.97,832.798,842.308,That was a surprise and I only hope that whenever I have a chance to meet him that he will remember doing that Video for me.,30,,
162,0.97,842.308,848.814,"So, I will remind him forever and I'll have to figure out some way to get a clip of that's.",30,,

169,0.97,866.031,878.644,"I've enjoyed working with each one of you, even when you were sending the patron comments and complaints, I was bad to see them.",30,,
170,0.97,878.644,886.151,It just really show the respect that you had for the office of the chief librarian to refer them to us to work with and hopefully we have served each of your districts in the entire city well.,30,,

274,0.97,1380.946,1382.214,Good afternoon.,35,,
275,0.97,1382.214,1390.922,District 7 Commenting as always on continuing police abuse and failed police accountability.,35,,
276,0.97,1390.922,1391.356,"October 7, 2020.",35,,
277,0.97,1391.356,1405.771,That is the day upon which all the horrible abuse leading up to the people of Seattle by SPD officers completely escapes accountability as we passed the 180 day mark for investigation and discipline.,35,,
278,0.97,1405.771,1408.373,The lesson learned by the SPD.,35,,
279,0.97,1408.373,1421.586,"If you engage in abuse and massive infringement of first amendment rights, do so in an overwhelming matter which swamps whatever tiny bit of accountability the system even pretends to afford.",35,,
280,0.97,1421.586,1431.329,"More than 10 months after the murder of George Floyd, and four people killed by the SPD during the last 12 months, the Council has consistently failed to deliver on police accountability.",35,,
281,0.97,1431.329,1442.34,"All of the oversight bodies, Dopa, the CDC, and the Oig have failed to even suggest changes in policies that can guarantee these abuses will not happen again.",35,,
282,0.97,1442.34,1451.082,"For only two accountability, not routinely violated policy can guarantee community safety.",35,,
283,0.97,1451.082,1467.532,The oversight bodies in the Council's lack of action will guarantee more police abuse in the weeks to come as black lives matter protests will resume with the conclusion of the George Floyd murder trial on the anniversary of his murder just weeks away this is on the immediate horizon.,35,,
284,0.97,1467.532,1468.533,How can you ignore it?,35,,
285,0.97,1468.533,1478.51,"As we approach the one-year mark post George Floyd, it is clear the Council will not deliver on his promises of 50%, or any significant level of the funding, nor promise to limit the weapons used by the SPD to abuse us.",35,,
286,0.97,1478.51,1483.148,100% achievable by you now.,35,,
287,0.97,1483.148,1489.054,Full civilian control of police oversight moving beyond police investigating police in a field the Archetype system.,35,,
288,0.97,1489.054,1491.656,"It is happening in Nashville, Oakland, Portland, Oregon and other cities.",35,,
289,0.97,1491.656,1493.258,Why don't we deserve that here?,35,,
290,0.97,1493.258,1496.127,Thank you.,35,,
291,0.97,1496.127,1506.471,Hello everyone.,36,,
292,0.97,1508.206,1511.176,This is my first time ever being a part here.,36,,
293,0.97,1511.176,1513.845,I really appreciate it.,36,,
294,0.97,1513.845,1526.791,My goal here today is to talk about the payoff campaign and the Seattle city council's goal in improving opportunity for gate workers.,36,,
295,0.97,1526.791,1538.603,"My goal is to provide you--provide the Council with some information about the kind of struggles that we deal with, and why it matters so much to us.",36,,
296,0.97,1538.603,1542.274,I be real quick.,36,,
297,0.97,1542.274,1545.911,I'll just say that a couple years ago I was at a real low point in my life.,36,,
298,0.97,1545.911,1547.512,Medical school didn't work out for me.,36,,
299,0.97,1547.512,1549.18,I ended up in the gig economy.,36,,
300,0.97,1549.18,1557.722,It really helped me out because I was able to slowly build up my self-esteem and also have a positive impact in my community.,36,,
301,0.97,1557.722,1559.09,Build up my confidence.,36,,
302,0.97,1559.09,1567.232,I moved to Seattle and ended up doing soul-searching and ended up going to boot camp.,36,,
303,0.97,1567.232,1571.336,That's what I'm doing this year.,36,,
304,0.97,1571.336,1581.646,My concern that I wanted to share was that I feel really scared that I could lose my income at any time because there has been several instances over the years where my gig Rideshare accounts go off-line.,36,,
305,0.97,1581.646,1586.751,Even though I have over 6000 rides and I'm a perfect Five- Star rating.,36,,
306,0.97,1586.751,1593.258,Somebody could report me for something like Maybe they said my car smelled like a jug.,36,,
307,0.97,1593.258,1595.06,It could be anything.,36,,
308,0.97,1595.06,1596.027,So many reasons.,36,,
309,0.97,1596.027,1603.969,Recently I got a ticket on the West Seattle bridge while I was on gig economy.,36,,
310,0.97,1603.969,1606.471,That really scares me that I could go off-line.,36,,
311,0.97,1606.471,1612.944,That's all I have to say about that.,36,,
312,0.97,1612.944,1626.758,"So, I incurred the Seattle city Council to pass bills that can help us and our situation this year.",36,,
313,0.97,1626.758,1630.395,"Also, I'll just say that one last thing is that I know we've gotten a big pay increase.",36,,
314,0.97,1630.395,1631.062,I'm so grateful.,36,,
315,0.97,1631.062,1632.464,That has really helped a lot.,36,,
316,0.97,1632.464,1634.499,There is still work to be --,36,,
317,0.97,1634.499,1639.704,Thank you.,37,,
318,0.97,1639.704,1648.713,Yes.,38,,
319,0.97,1648.713,1651.916,Thank you so much for hearing us today.,38,,
320,0.97,1651.916,1654.819,I am one of the gig workers that work with Instacart.,38,,
321,0.97,1654.819,1670.301,"Also a member . The main reason why I'm here is because as a gig worker, working with Instacart for a long period of time, it was only a matter of time before we can keep this up anymore.",38,,
322,0.97,1670.301,1674.906,We are getting paid way less than the minimum wage.,38,,
323,0.97,1674.906,1687.919,"Mainly the pandemic is allowing these type of gig workers, or gig worker platforms, to take more advantage of us since the demand is a whole lot higher.",38,,
324,0.97,1687.919,1692.59,They know that a lot of us have lost our jobs are that we need additional income to make ends meet.,38,,
325,0.97,1692.59,1703.968,"Therefore, they take advantage of us by giving us--they do give us work but they decrease the amount of money that we make an hour for most of the gig jobs.",38,,
326,0.97,1703.968,1713.745,"Another big reason is that it helps us to be able to pay, you know put food in our kids' miles.",38,,
327,0.97,1713.745,1718.383,A lot of us bring our kids with us during this to be the good work.,38,,
328,0.97,1718.383,1720.418,The amount is so low we can't even afford Childcare.,38,,
329,0.97,1720.418,1727.092,It basically pays seven dollars per job.,38,,
330,0.97,1727.092,1730.795,Seven dollars per job when you have four kids and you are a single mom is not enough.,38,,
331,0.97,1730.795,1733.064,"On top of that, where using our own resources.",38,,
332,0.97,1733.064,1737.268,"We use our vehicles, which means we need more tire replacement.",38,,
333,0.97,1737.268,1742.907,We need money to replace our oil and have oil changes.,38,,
334,0.97,1742.907,1747.412,"Not to mention gas, which is constantly going up.",38,,
335,0.97,1747.412,1749.481,"For example, I even got in a car accident.",38,,
336,0.97,1749.481,1753.118,It is not like these gig jobs pay for insurance.,38,,
337,0.97,1753.118,1755.72,We normally pay our own insurance.,38,,
338,0.97,1755.72,1757.522,That's not enough.,38,,
339,0.97,1757.522,1768.032,Seven dollars is not enough.,38,,
340,0.97,1768.399,1771.936,Thank you for calling in today.,39,,
341,0.97,1771.936,1782.347,"Hello, city Council, can you hear?",40,,

344,0.97,1787.852,1800.765,"Thank you, the homeless crisis is ongoing for veterans who are also civilians that are being forgotten, forsaken and denied the same assistance in getting off the streets that the repeat offending serious criminals down in Pioneer square and Chinatown are offered.",42,,
345,0.97,1800.765,1804.269,Which is a motel.,42,,

350,0.97,1834.165,1850.215,"Because of this lack of funds for a debit card, veterans are forced back into the street because no funds for motel extensions are offered while some of them are still disabled and needing to better care for themselves that requires a home with Bathtubs to Reheat their Achilles and ice after stretching with lots of rest and elevation.",42,,
351,0.97,1850.215,1857.522,The Democrats got all the Covid homeless crisis money and the veterans need some of it to be shared by the city Council and the executive office of the Mayor.,42,,

361,0.97,1893.658,1907.272,"I was just hoping that instead of having some of the staff telling us they're going to circle back to this particular issue, maybe we could address some of the ongoing crises and redirect some of that money to the King County veteran's.",44,,
362,0.97,1907.272,1909.741,I think it is social services for veterans families.,44,,

364,0.97,1912.377,1922.32,Can you hear me?,45,,
365,0.97,1922.32,1925.456,"We can hear you, go ahead.",46,,
366,0.97,1925.456,1931.462,Hello.,47,,
367,0.97,1931.462,1934.699,I'm an On-Demand gig worker on Grubhub in Seattle and a member of the pay up campaign.,47,,
368,0.97,1934.699,1944.509,I thank you for the opportunity to briefly explain why gig workers need Lawmakersto raise our pay and set standards for this emerging and expanding industry.,47,,
369,0.97,1944.509,1948.112,Bypassing the PAYOUT policy this year.,47,,
370,0.97,1948.112,1952.984,I started doing gig work because of back injuries.,47,,
371,0.97,1952.984,1954.085,It has rendered me partially disabled.,47,,
372,0.97,1954.085,1957.422,"I am too disabled to work Full- time, but not enough to qualify for state or Federal help.",47,,
373,0.97,1957.422,1966.397,"Although it is illegal to, traditional employers will not employ someone who needs minor disability accommodations.",47,,
374,0.97,1966.397,1971.035,I have stopped trying.,47,,
375,0.97,1971.035,1977.575,Gig work is the only industry that allows me the flexibility to set my own work hours while working at a pace and intensity that I'm physically comfortable with.,47,,
376,0.97,1977.575,1979.811,Gig work is my only source of income.,47,,
377,0.97,1979.811,1982.647,I also don't earn enough to get by.,47,,
378,0.97,1982.647,1991.356,Grubhub used some sort of crystal ball method to determine what an order is worth.,47,,
379,0.97,1991.356,1996.461,I can make as little as a few dollars per order.,47,,
380,0.97,1996.461,1999.864,Actually Grubhub are trying to undermine the flexibility and paper order that I depend on.,47,,
381,0.97,1999.864,2004.969,"My rating can be lowered for various reasons by Grubhub, often reasons I have no control over.",47,,
382,0.97,2004.969,2007.171,A lowered rating results in lower paying orders.,47,,
383,0.97,2007.171,2016.147,Thus decreasing my paper we need Seattle city Council to pass the PAYOUT policy for gig workers.,47,,
384,0.97,2016.147,2018.75,"Because we are not disposable, and should not be exploited.",47,,
385,0.97,2018.75,2023.988,Gig workers should be afforded the same rights and Dignities of traditional employees.,47,,
386,0.97,2023.988,2026.09,Thank you for your time and your support.,47,,
387,0.97,2026.09,2032.397,Thank you for calling in today.,48,,
388,0.97,2032.397,2039.504,Can you hear me?,49,,
389,0.97,2039.504,2041.005,"Yes, go ahead.",50,,
390,0.97,2041.005,2049.881,"I am a gig driver, gig worker in the Seattle area.",51,,
391,0.97,2049.881,2054.085,Basically northern King County.,51,,
392,0.97,2054.085,2066.33,I recognize that the Seattle city Council has already done a lot of--made a lot of progress and concessions toward gig workers.,51,,
393,0.97,2066.33,2082.146,"And concerned that the current bill that is being discussed that would focus on independent contractors, while not harmful, doesn't really do enough.",51,,
394,0.97,2082.146,2084.015,It isn't really directly related to what we need.,51,,
395,0.97,2084.015,2106.871,"The rights to negotiate contracts is great and everything, but those contracts are only as useful as the laws are for--if I'm not entitled to higher pay, then it doesn't matter.",51,,
396,0.97,2106.871,2114.278,"Even if I am entitled to my contract, that is not going to necessarily be good.",51,,
397,0.97,2114.278,2123.588,I think basically what I'm saying is the city needs to focus on the pay up laws.,51,,
398,0.97,2123.588,2133.965,Pay up policies instead of this big independent contractor rights stop.,51,,
399,0.97,2133.965,2138.002,"Again, I appreciate everything that Seattle has done.",51,,
400,0.97,2138.002,2142.907,They have already made a lot of concessions.,51,,
401,0.97,2142.907,2144.275,We can still go further.,51,,
402,0.97,2144.275,2147.111,Thank you for your time.,51,,

415,0.97,2188.853,2192.256,We need something that is a permanent thing.,55,,
416,0.97,2192.256,2198.563,We don't want it to go back to business as usual once this Covid thing has been deemed done.,55,,
417,0.97,2198.563,2203.234,"So, we need something on the books where it actually helps gig workers.",55,,
418,0.97,2203.234,2209.273,That's a floor that is high enough that we are not making less than minimum wage.,55,,
419,0.97,2209.273,2211.175,We need to be making over minimum wage.,55,,
420,0.97,2211.175,2211.976,Our expenses are huge.,55,,

487,0.97,2523.988,2528.058,I will try to reiterate a few of the points I made this morning because I think it's important for context.,77,,
488,0.97,2528.058,2531.495,This is in addition to many of the steps that the Council has taken over the years.,77,,
489,0.97,2531.495,2539.403,It's important to remember that this is a complementary piece of legislation that we are asking for from the state partners.,77,,
490,0.97,2539.403,2544.675,To complement and expand upon strategies that the city Council has led on.,77,,
491,0.97,2544.675,2547.711,Not a matter of the Council.,77,,

493,0.97,2550.981,2554.418,It is not a matter of inaction or failure.,77,,
494,0.97,2554.418,2565.396,"This is a matter of us recognizing that this issue is far bigger than our borders, and we need state partners and thankful to have Federal partners, to help us address the crisis.",77,,
495,0.97,2565.396,2579.643,"We have, through the city councils work, and I was part that sponsored the legislation, acted to make sure that our office of housing has the opportunity to move forward with strategic acquisition when properties become available so that we can purchase hotels, apartments, multifamily structures, and do so with urgency.",77,,
496,0.97,2579.643,2585.516,We passed that in 2018 and we are seeing that legislation be used this year to purchase property.,77,,
497,0.97,2585.516,2596.26,This is part of the conversations that we have had with the regional housing authority.,77,,
498,0.97,2596.26,2613.344,"We have talked to our regional partners here about the importance of purchasing properties so that we can House people, whether it is shelters, where it is long-term housing solutions, and to do that as a good way of being in partnership with small landlords as well.",77,,
499,0.97,2613.344,2620.25,"Or, property developers who do not have the opportunity to continue with developing those properties any longer.",77,,
500,0.97,2620.25,2627.424,We don't want there to be derelict partners in the middle of the housing and homelessness crisis.,77,,
501,0.97,2627.424,2631.495,Making sure we are purchasing these properties quickly and we have the resources available to replenish revolving funds is critical.,77,,
502,0.97,2631.495,2641.572,I want to offer that context as part of our ongoing discussions here in the city to really push back on any narrative that we are waiting for somebody else to step up.,77,,
503,0.97,2641.572,2645.409,"We have, in many ways, stepped up to the plate.",77,,
504,0.97,2645.409,2655.586,"The crisis is far bigger than we can catch up with even before Covid, and now during Covid and seeing so many people lose their livelihoods, more people are falling into homelessness.",77,,
505,0.97,2655.586,2664.928,"We must ask with urgency to expand upon which the city council have put into play, including the $135 million that are part of Jumpstart's revenue that will begin coming to the city next year.",77,,
506,0.97,2664.928,2680.844,"With that context in mind, and with the strong leadership of the Council President, in bringing this letter forward, and your partnership with Oir and other cities across the state, I'm very happy to sign on.",77,,
507,0.97,2680.844,2687.284,"I hope that context is helpful to show how we are continuing to work for additional partners, and have them and will continue to show leadership here in the city as well.",77,,
508,0.97,2687.284,2688.585,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",78,,
