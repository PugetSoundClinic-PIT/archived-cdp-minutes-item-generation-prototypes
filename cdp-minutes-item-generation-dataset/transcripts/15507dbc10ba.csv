162,0.97,1272.571,1282.481,Is making it hard to even dream of having a family in the city much--unless you have a lot of money.,18,,
163,0.97,1282.481,1296.161,"I appreciate you bringing forward and I want to--the campaign trail, adding Childcare centers across the city will improve access for families in lower cost.",18,,
164,0.97,1296.161,1306.505,"Also want to recognize that Portland, today is passing zoning reform across the city, make it possible to build four homes and every lots in six if they are affordable.",18,,
165,0.97,1306.505,1316.281,This should be a good model for Seattle to emulate considering how sleeping and what the impact could be for affordable housing providers.,18,,
166,0.97,1316.281,1326.391,"Let's build on Childcare centers, legislation by making it also easy to build affordable housing all over the city.",18,,
167,0.97,1326.391,1327.826,Thank you.,18,,
168,0.97,1327.826,1329.628,"Thank you, Doug.",19,,

179,0.97,1405.504,1406.271,There we are.,21,,
180,0.97,1406.271,1412.31,Good to hear your voice.,21,,

182,0.97,1412.711,1414.146,Thank you for this amazing buildup.,22,,
183,0.97,1414.146,1414.98,"Is like, is she there?",22,,
184,0.97,1414.98,1418.617,Star six does not work universally.,22,,
185,0.97,1418.617,1420.819,Thank you everybody.,22,,
186,0.97,1420.819,1424.523,"Deb Barker West Seattle resident, finally Unmuted.",22,,
187,0.97,1424.523,1437.135,I want to thank staff for their assistance in working through the nuances of counsel bill 119835.,22,,
188,0.97,1437.135,1448.313,"And happy retirement to L mills, who started this omnibus bill and then left it in another world.",22,,
189,0.97,1448.313,1449.347,"So happy retirement, bill mills.",22,,
190,0.97,1449.347,1457.656,I want to advise counsel that it would be great to adopt the majority of the omnibus bill.,22,,
191,0.97,1457.656,1461.927,And I urge you to keep it in the minor category.,22,,
192,0.97,1461.927,1470.035,And stop putting in things that feel like they are minor.,22,,
193,0.97,1470.035,1473.471,Not that there is anything like a Resound in here but that has been done in the past.,22,,
194,0.97,1473.471,1476.875,Don't add any more complexity to an already complex zoning code.,22,,
195,0.97,1476.875,1485.05,"I echo David Moehring's comments about, if you want to do something then do it.",22,,
196,0.97,1485.05,1489.354,"Say it out loud, say it in a proper forum and don't try to hide it in an omnibus bill.",22,,
197,0.97,1489.354,1502.167,I support the landmark proposed changes as the former six year member of the Seattle landmarks board.,22,,
198,0.97,1502.167,1507.405,"And again, thanks to staff and other Councilmembers to probably know how to Unmute their phone better than I do.",22,,

200,0.97,1507.806,1512.477,Thank you.,23,,
201,0.97,1512.477,1514.179,It was a fun buildup this morning.,23,,
202,0.97,1514.179,1517.115,And we still have two more.,23,,
203,0.97,1517.115,1518.216,Judith and Mary.,23,,
204,0.97,1518.216,1522.42,Ruby I see you listed as not present.,23,,

206,0.97,1527.526,1528.126,Take it.,23,,
207,0.97,1528.126,1531.329,Can you hear me?,24,,
208,0.97,1531.329,1532.931,Can you hear me?,24,,
209,0.97,1532.931,1536.801,I can.,25,,
210,0.97,1536.801,1545.443,Now I cannot.,25,,
211,0.97,1545.443,1546.011,Hello?,26,,
212,0.97,1546.011,1546.811,Can you hear me?,26,,
213,0.97,1546.811,1547.445,I can't.,27,,
214,0.97,1547.445,1548.246,"Yes, we can hear you.",27,,
215,0.97,1548.246,1549.247,"Good, thank you.",28,,
216,0.97,1549.247,1556.321,I would like to echo Deborah Barker's words about thanks to Noah and to Toby and to--Freeman.,28,,
217,0.97,1556.321,1556.955,They have been helpful.,28,,
218,0.97,1556.955,1564.629,I would like to support the substitute language that is been proposed for the unit lot subdivision on the omnibus bill.,28,,
219,0.97,1564.629,1575.273,It is unfortunate what was there in the first place and it caused a huge amount of confusion from a lot of people.,28,,
220,0.97,1575.273,1582.147,So I would like to--I'm glad that is being proposed and I would urge that all of you vote for that portion of the substitute.,28,,
221,0.97,1582.147,1595.36,Deb Barker is my crew on landmark thing because she is on the landmark board.,28,,
222,0.97,1595.36,1598.663,But I have a concern about that and I wanted to share it with you.,28,,
223,0.97,1598.663,1609.407,"Because it has been couched as--and not significant, all these changes which some of us felt, a lot of them definitely were significant.",28,,
224,0.97,1609.407,1612.21,I think that a lot of people have had the opportunity to read this.,28,,
225,0.97,1612.21,1624.022,"And particularly, folks like at the Laurelhurst community Council and I sent an Email to Eugenia at historic Seattle yesterday.",28,,
226,0.97,1624.022,1625.624,She had never heard of this.,28,,
227,0.97,1625.624,1642.841,"I'm wondering, whether that section on the condition use authorization for landmark sites could be somehow tabled or just put off? so that people put in the know and have concerns about the issue can weigh in on it.",28,,
228,0.97,1642.841,1649.347,It could be that it is fine.,28,,
229,0.97,1649.347,1654.452,"But as Mr. Freeman said, he didn't know whether there had been outreach, regarding this.",28,,
230,0.97,1654.452,1658.957,"And I think that just as a matter of fairness to everybody, that should be done.",28,,
231,0.97,1658.957,1664.229,"Other than that, those are my few words and thank you very much for your substitute.",28,,
232,0.97,1664.229,1667.065,"Thank you, Judith.",29,,
233,0.97,1667.065,1678.243,"Next we have Mary Hart and the last two people are listed as not present, Ruby Holland and Katie.",29,,
234,0.97,1678.243,1681.079,"Ruby and Katie, if you plan to join, please call into the line.",29,,
235,0.97,1681.079,1684.549,"Mary Hodder, if you are ready?",29,,
236,0.97,1684.549,1685.15,There you are.,29,,
237,0.97,1685.15,1685.75,Take it away.,29,,
238,0.97,1685.75,1687.786,Thank goodness.,30,,
239,0.97,1687.786,1690.455,After 30 Star six is.,30,,
240,0.97,1690.455,1699.764,I am calling about the unit subdivision.,30,,
241,0.97,1699.764,1701.433,That piece of the legislation you are proposing.,30,,
242,0.97,1701.433,1720.719,"I wanted to point out the legislative analysis done on this provision which says, however the proposed omnibus language introduces ambiguity into the code that could lead to unintended consequences for future development of vacant lots.",30,,
243,0.97,1720.719,1722.287,Created through the unit lot subdivision process.,30,,
244,0.97,1722.287,1724.322,I want to point out an additional piece of ambiguity.,30,,
245,0.97,1724.322,1726.391,There is no minimum lot size requirement for this.,30,,
246,0.97,1726.391,1747.112,"So in your example, on the legislative right up, you show in Maine house, you show a cottage detached and the developer could come in, purchase the house, put in the--, then Subdivides them up and add additional--.",30,,
247,0.97,1747.112,1757.055,Because they could keep it all the way down.,30,,
248,0.97,1757.055,1759.157,They could Subdivide and Subdivide because there is no minimum.,30,,
249,0.97,1759.157,1760.592,That's an additional piece of ambiguity.,30,,
250,0.97,1760.592,1776.541,My concern about ambiguity is that right now the already giant hole for ambiguity that developers drive semi trucks through in terms of Loctite and lot coverage.,30,,
251,0.97,1776.541,1778.576,There are a bunch of ways to gain those systems.,30,,
252,0.97,1778.576,1786.518,I figured out what they are and I am watching developers do this now today in fact blueprint capital services is putting this in the House next door.,30,,
253,0.97,1786.518,1792.79,"They figured out how to get 10 extra height, 10 extra feet of height because they gained the height requirement.",30,,
254,0.97,1792.79,1818.383,"So the other piece that I want to point out is, imagine this, developers who are in the 1% versus homeowners whose only wealth generally is on paper in the value of their home, is typically will come in and compete with individuals to buy single-family homes so that they can put in Adu's in Dadu's, multiple of them.",30,,
255,0.97,1818.383,1824.689,The problem is that they can construct wholesale.,30,,
256,0.97,1824.689,1826.758,We have reached the end of the comment period.,31,,
257,0.97,1826.758,1830.795,I want to let you know that the piece you are speaking to has been removed from the bill.,31,,
258,0.97,1830.795,1831.062,Okay.,32,,
259,0.97,1831.062,1832.53,The ambiguity about lot size?,32,,
260,0.97,1832.53,1842.674,Yes.,33,,
261,0.97,1843.808,1846.411,"Okay, my other concern is that you are basically favoring the 1%.",34,,
262,0.97,1846.411,1847.846,And individual homeowners will get the shaft.,34,,
263,0.97,1847.846,1848.446,I appreciate.,35,,
264,0.97,1848.446,1850.682,"If you could follow up with written comments, we need to go.",35,,
265,0.97,1850.682,1851.516,That was two minutes.,35,,
266,0.97,1851.516,1852.317,Thank you very much.,35,,
267,0.97,1852.317,1854.352,I did a two-minute Timer and it wasn't up.,36,,
268,0.97,1854.352,1855.353,I'm sorry about that.,37,,
269,0.97,1855.353,1861.059,I really appreciate hearing you this morning Mary.,37,,
270,0.97,1861.059,1883.248,"Seeing as we have no additional speakers remotely present, double checking that BB and Katie are not present, I.T., can you confirm for me?",37,,
271,0.97,1885.316,1886.05,That is correct.,38,,
272,0.97,1886.05,1887.452,"I see that note, thank you.",39,,
273,0.97,1887.452,1891.489,Seeing we have no additional speakers remotely present we will move to the next agenda item.,39,,
274,0.97,1891.489,1898.596,Our first item of business is a briefing a public hearing for CB 119827 which resounds land in Rainier Beach for affordable housing.,39,,
275,0.97,1898.596,1904.502,Please read the abbreviated title into the record.,39,,
276,0.97,1904.502,1917.715,"Yes, agenda item one, counsel bill 119827, and ordinance related to land use and zoning attending the code to Rezone land in Rainier Beach neighborhood.",40,,
277,0.97,1917.715,1919.717,"Thank you, Noah.",41,,
278,0.97,1919.717,1926.858,We are joined by Yolanda at counsel central staff and dates from office of planning and community development.,41,,
279,0.97,1926.858,1930.728,Please introduce yourselves and provide an overview of the proposal.,41,,
280,0.97,1930.728,1931.696,Thank you.,41,,
281,0.97,1931.696,1942.907,"Yes, Yolanda, counsel central staff.",42,,
282,0.97,1942.907,1943.508,Good morning.,43,,
283,0.97,1943.508,1945.143,"Jeff, office of planning and community development.",44,,
284,0.97,1945.143,1945.743,"Good morning, Jeff.",45,,
285,0.97,1945.743,1947.945,Take it away.,45,,
286,0.97,1947.945,1948.746,Okay.,46,,
287,0.97,1948.746,1952.65,Good morning Joe Straus and also numbers.,46,,
288,0.97,1952.65,1959.157,I am going to provide brief background for you on counsel bill 119827.,46,,
289,0.97,1959.157,1962.56,I will share my screen here.,46,,
290,0.97,1962.56,1973.871,And this is the presentation attached to the agenda.,46,,
291,0.97,1974.038,1976.407,Please let me know if you don't see the presentation.,46,,
292,0.97,1976.407,1978.476,We cannot.,47,,
293,0.97,1978.476,1980.845,Thank you.,48,,
294,0.97,1980.845,1988.586,"This action, we are calling it Rainier Beach area Rezone to support affordable housing.",49,,
295,0.97,1988.586,1992.59,And I will describe the proposal for you.,49,,
296,0.97,1992.59,2018.182,These are two clusters or groups of lands in and around Rainier Beach and these are part of a cohesive strategy to support 100% rent and income restrictive affordable housing in an area that has a wealth of services and amenities for residents.,49,,
297,0.97,2018.182,2035.233,It is also an area of the city that has a high risk displacement and the action would support Anti-Displacement or stabilize communities and not displace any housing.,49,,
298,0.97,2035.233,2049.147,Actions are also supported by Community-Based agencies and both groups of parcels have partnership with Community- based agencies.,49,,
299,0.97,2049.147,2065.963,The proposal was brought forward to you at this time because we believe this grouping of actions can contribute to recovery to help stabilize communities in this time of increased pressure.,49,,
300,0.97,2065.963,2069.867,The two clusters of parcels total 2.72 acres.,49,,
301,0.97,2069.867,2071.502,There is no housing on the sights.,49,,
302,0.97,2071.502,2077.775,They are vacant and underutilized lands for both areas.,49,,
303,0.97,2077.775,2080.445,The resounds would allow for more cost-effective construction.,49,,
304,0.97,2080.445,2088.152,"All the areas are under site control by nonprofit, affordable housing developers.",49,,
305,0.97,2088.152,2094.592,And what is proposed would allow them to essentially increase the amount of housing provided without much additional cost.,49,,
306,0.97,2094.592,2103.968,The direct report analyzes consistency and comprehensive plan and the proposal is consistent with the plan.,49,,
307,0.97,2103.968,2115.112,The Rezone would also meet Seattle municipal code criteria and the review was completed and the comment and appeal period has expired.,49,,
308,0.97,2115.112,2121.886,I will refer to these two groups of sites as the South rose tree cluster and the South Cloverdale Street cluster.,49,,
309,0.97,2121.886,2133.03,"You can see on map that they are separated by about a quarter mile, very close to one another.",49,,
310,0.97,2133.03,2143.808,"And they are close to the Ethiopian community center, which is between the sites on Rainier Avenue . They are close to Rainier Beach high school, close to South Lake high school and Rainier Buttes--Beach community center.",49,,
311,0.97,2143.808,2147.044,Now we will look at each group with more detail.,49,,
312,0.97,2147.044,2153.951,"Starting at the South, this is the South Cloverdale Street cluster.",49,,
313,0.97,2153.951,2157.355,You can see it is just off the shoulder of the Rainier Beach high school sports fields.,49,,
314,0.97,2157.355,2164.929,The area proposed to changes is the hatched area.,49,,
315,0.97,2164.929,2167.965,The change will increase the height limit from 55 feet to 65 feet.,49,,
316,0.97,2167.965,2170.468,Neighborhood commercial zone would not change.,49,,
317,0.97,2170.468,2190.888,"This site is the proposed affordable housing development and would include on the ground floor of the Rainier Beach community food Bank, also referred to as a community center, that would look and feel like a grocery store.",49,,
318,0.97,2190.888,2203.501,And would have all affordable housing for very low income families on the floor above the ground level.,49,,
319,0.97,2203.501,2205.136,Going to Scroll to the second site.,49,,
320,0.97,2205.136,2209.807,South rose Street cluster.,49,,
321,0.97,2209.807,2213.21,You can see the front of the site faces on to Rainier Avenue South.,49,,
322,0.97,2213.21,2220.184,It extends to the East within the block.,49,,
323,0.97,2220.184,2234.999,"It is a split zone parcel, so the front portion facing Rainier Avenue South would Resound from the rest to multifamily and neighborhood commercial with 55 foot height limit.",49,,
324,0.97,2234.999,2256.921,"That change will allow more housing and allow also for the location of Muslim housing services, nonprofit offices, you heard from Rizwan in the, earlier, they propose to locate their offices there . It would also include a Childcare center with classrooms and sights.",49,,
325,0.97,2256.921,2264.629,"The back or rear portion of the site, be Rezone from Single- family to three multifamily.",49,,
326,0.97,2264.629,2274.572,"And the proposal would have a transition from higher density facing Rainier Avenue South, tapering off to the East.",49,,
327,0.97,2274.572,2289.854,"This proposal would include our family sized housing units of two, three and four bedrooms and include substantial amount of Family-Friendly open spaces.",49,,
328,0.97,2289.854,2301.399,So that is a very high-level overview of the Rezone proposals and what they intend to support.,49,,
329,0.97,2301.399,2302.5,And that concludes my presentation today.,49,,
330,0.97,2302.5,2312.576,"We would be happy, Council members to answer any follow-up questions you may have for either my office or the office of housing and are partners.",49,,
331,0.97,2312.576,2313.01,Thank you.,49,,
332,0.97,2313.01,2313.811,"Thank you, Jeff.",50,,
333,0.97,2313.811,2319.283,I do have a few questions but I want to check with Lawanda to see if you have anything you would like to provide at this time.,50,,
334,0.97,2319.283,2329.226,The only thing I would NOTE is that the attachment two to the staff member is a proposed substitute version of the bill.,51,,
335,0.97,2329.226,2348.679,And it just makes Technicals corrections by striking attachment one in two which illustrates each of the separate Resound areas and replaced them with a single attachment showing the entire Resound area and AMENDS the language in counsel bill 119827 accordingly.,51,,
336,0.97,2348.679,2351.349,And it also corrects the South Rezone Street area.,51,,
337,0.97,2351.349,2380.845,"South rose Street Rezone area to accurately reflect the existing zoning boundaries, which don't quite follow the personal lines along the Southwest portion of the parcel and for the Western portion of the area it changes the mandatory housing Affordability suffix from Ansi 255 from M1 to M which is consistent with the scale of the development capacity.",51,,
338,0.97,2380.845,2381.245,Thank you.,52,,
339,0.97,2381.245,2384.281,"Jeff, if you can share your presentation one more time.",52,,
340,0.97,2384.281,2392.389,I appreciate about this proposal is that it seems to take each area and bump it up one level.,52,,
341,0.97,2392.389,2402.533,And with the Roe Street portion that is tapered in such a way that it stays within the character of the neighborhood.,52,,
342,0.97,2402.533,2414.912,"Jeff, can you or Yolanda speak to what distinguishes this proposal from a contract Rezone process?",52,,
343,0.97,2414.912,2418.416,"Yes, thank you for that question.",53,,
344,0.97,2418.416,2428.993,"So as I mentioned, this is really a group, a collection of sites that constitutes an Areawide action.",53,,
345,0.97,2428.993,2438.169,Is a cohesive strategy to add housing in a place with support services.,53,,
346,0.97,2438.169,2443.841,It is not an individual proposal for counsel is being asked to take action on the Rezone of the land.,53,,
347,0.97,2443.841,2457.354,"You are not being asked to take action on the specifics or development proposals although I provided supplemental information, if you will on partnerships that are underway.",53,,
348,0.97,2457.354,2465.763,So the short answer is that this is an Areawide proposal in the sense that it is fulfilling a strategy that is linked to the goals and comprehensive plan.,53,,
349,0.97,2465.763,2476.474,In the Rainier Beach neighborhood plan and it is different from a varied Site- specific One-Off action.,53,,
350,0.97,2476.474,2477.975,"Thank you, that is very helpful.",54,,
351,0.97,2477.975,2486.884,And you also let me know if you have heard any or if obesity generally have heard anything from the surrounding community over the proposed change?,54,,
352,0.97,2486.884,2492.556,We have not heard concerns expressed directly.,55,,
353,0.97,2492.556,2500.464,There has been a lot of support.,55,,
354,0.97,2500.464,2510.207,The Community-Based agencies and the nonprofit housing providers have done extensive outreach about both sets of parcels with the neighborhood and the renewed support.,55,,
355,0.97,2510.207,2523.621,I have not heard any comments through the process otherwise proposing the proposal.,55,,
356,0.97,2523.621,2524.221,Thank you.,56,,
357,0.97,2524.221,2529.426,"And we know, how many affordable units are anticipated to be generated in the Rezone period?",56,,
358,0.97,2529.426,2543.541,"Together, we anticipate that it would be approximately 425 affordable homes . and about 20% of those would be enabled by the section.",57,,
359,0.97,2543.541,2544.341,Thank you.,58,,
360,0.97,2544.341,2546.143,"Yolanda, do you have anythin to add?",58,,
361,0.97,2546.143,2552.85,Or counsel?,58,,
362,0.97,2552.85,2553.45,Any questions?,58,,
363,0.97,2553.45,2555.853,"I don't have anything at this time, chair.",59,,
364,0.97,2555.853,2558.155,"I see Councilmember Pedersen, please take it away.",60,,
365,0.97,2558.155,2562.459,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",61,,
366,0.97,2562.459,2572.236,Since this is located in Rainier Beach neighborhood I want to ask if the executive had checked with Councilmember Tammy Morales office.,61,,
367,0.97,2572.236,2583.948,It is my understanding that she has been--this has been discuss with her and I will double check before our next committee meeting when we know this.,62,,
368,0.97,2583.948,2588.852,Today is simply a public hearing and briefing.,62,,
369,0.97,2588.852,2591.655,"So good question, Councilmember Pedersen.",62,,
370,0.97,2591.655,2594.692,Thanks.,63,,

373,0.97,2603.267,2618.916,"I want to emphasize, if I'm not at the next meeting, my support for this effort, I'm excited about these projects and affordable housing, that pairs with everything we have always talked about to make sure that there is access to livable, Walkable, healthy communities.",65,,
374,0.97,2618.916,2623.988,So I'm really excited about the child care and job training.,65,,
375,0.97,2623.988,2628.225,The business incubation and community space near good transit options as well.,65,,
376,0.97,2628.225,2635.532,We kind of get lost a little bit sometimes in the language used in housing and zoning.,65,,
377,0.97,2635.532,2643.007,"I want to lift up that this is an incredible project that we have, the opportunity and really the privilege to help move forward at this point.",65,,
378,0.97,2643.007,2656.854,"These projects were really, I think rooted in what community has been asking for for a very long time.",65,,
379,0.97,2656.854,2666.964,Congratulations to the Rainier Beach community in particular for their years of work to advance food innovation center and making sure that the neighborhood had affordable housing while also investing in economic development and good jobs for communities.,65,,

384,0.97,2681.712,2686.483,I had the same question as Councilmember Pedersen about consultation with Councilmember Morales.,67,,
385,0.97,2686.483,2691.989,"I wanted to just wait to hear from her off-line, I guess.",67,,

414,0.97,2823.42,2833.197,I want to emphasize the importance of the project and the requirement for the amendment to go forward.,71,,
415,0.97,2833.197,2843.24,"As mentioned earlier, 20% of units will be affected if this is not approved and it is a huge shortage of housing for families within Seattle.",71,,
416,0.97,2843.24,2859.556,"When issue facing homeless provider agencies, finding large units in the city of Seattle . There has been instances where we have had to move families into other parts of the county.",71,,
417,0.97,2859.556,2872.97,Particularly toward the Federal way area . One instance we had a family of 14 people who are homeless in two separate homeless shelters.,71,,
418,0.97,2872.97,2878.075,Because they could not fit in one and cannot find housing in Seattle where we could house them so we had to modify.,71,,
419,0.97,2878.075,2889.453,This is one of the unique--going on right now in the sense that several units are three and four bedroom to allow larger families to be housed within the city.,71,,
420,0.97,2889.453,2897.394,A lot of the units being built are one and two-bedroom range.,71,,
421,0.97,2897.394,2906.503,"It is critical that this goes forward and again, as our agency, we need to find more space to help the community.",71,,
422,0.97,2906.503,2918.415,"It has grown over the years and this would be an opportunity for us to have professional office space within the community, that we serve . and make it more accessible for people in the community to access for services.",71,,

430,0.97,2944.441,2949.112,-- a nonprofit developing and operating affordable housing in the Rainier valley.,73,,
431,0.97,2949.112,2955.919,We are excited that our project is the one that Jeff was referring to on the South Cloverdale project.,73,,
432,0.97,2955.919,2967.464,We are planning 221 units of affordable housing and this is located within the activity and development corridor of the Rainier Beach neighborhood plan update.,73,,
433,0.97,2967.464,2979.242,"In addition to affordable housing, we are also Partnering with the Rainier Valley food bank to have them in the food center on the ground floor.",73,,
434,0.97,2979.242,2991.788,This will be a great community asset that will feel like a grocery store but function like a food bank.,73,,
435,0.97,2991.788,3001.765,This result will allow the project to be economically feasible for the food Bank and also produce another 40 units of housing while decreasing the public funding request of the city housing.,73,,
436,0.97,3001.765,3008.005,Support the Rezone because it will greatly asset the community.,73,,
437,0.97,3008.005,3012.109,Thank you.,73,,

452,0.97,3100.297,3113.41,"It remains impediments--allows Childcare the permitted use in all zones, child care centers be at least 600 feet apart from each other.",77,,
453,0.97,3113.41,3121.418,Regulations also included in licensing requirements removes maximum--.,77,,

459,0.97,3151.248,3154.117,"Just a quick note, thank you.",79,,
460,0.97,3154.117,3167.33,I know I heard from a number of providers and provider advocates who appreciate the important first steps as part of the bigger picture and how we get more affordable and accessible Childcare across the city.,79,,
461,0.97,3167.33,3169.766,Thank you for taking the step and I'm happy to support it.,79,,
462,0.97,3169.766,3174.838,"Thank you, Vice-Chair Mosqueda.",80,,
463,0.97,3174.838,3177.44,Councilmember Pedersen.,80,,
464,0.97,3177.44,3181.745,Thank you.,81,,
465,0.97,3181.745,3185.982,I want to thank Vice-Chair Mosqueda who's been talking about the need to expand Childcare for a really long time.,81,,
466,0.97,3185.982,3190.954,And Joe Straus for taking up the Mantle to get the legislation through.,81,,
467,0.97,3190.954,3194.991,And of course all the staff who worked on it and did the real work for the staff level.,81,,
468,0.97,3194.991,3212.208,"And my issue is that I want to make sure that we have high- quality Childcare when these Kiddos are at the stage of life, this is one their brains are developing rapidly.",81,,
469,0.97,3212.208,3214.077,So the quality of the Childcare is really important.,81,,
470,0.97,3214.077,3216.079,It is one chance that we have to provide that.,81,,
471,0.97,3216.079,3221.117,This is just a Land-Use quote.,81,,
472,0.97,3221.117,3234.13,I had discussions with the Department of education and really learning to make sure that there would be no impact on quality and it is that this is a Land-Use bill not a child care licensing bill or Childcare subsidy bill.,81,,
473,0.97,3234.13,3252.616,"I just want to get on the record that it is one of my concerns, making sure that the city is enabling Childcare that we also are mindful of the Once- In-A-Lifetime chance that we have to provide that high- quality so the children get off to a really great and strong start.",81,,
474,0.97,3252.616,3255.452,Thank you.,81,,
475,0.97,3255.452,3256.553,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",82,,
476,0.97,3256.553,3261.658,That is a great reminder that this is just one aspect of permitting.,82,,
477,0.97,3261.658,3264.427,It is a secondary aspect of permitting.,82,,
478,0.97,3264.427,3307.604,"There still primary permit that Childcare facilities will still need to have approval from and Additionally there is state regulations and state codes for Licensure of the Childcare facilities . This is simply changing a conditional aspect of the Childcare permit, which is an additional step beyond the primary permit . Additionally, this work that Councilmember Pedersen, you have done behind you with quality preschool, this makes some technical changes to ensure that preschool and Childcare are able to receive the same definitions within our code.",82,,
479,0.97,3307.604,3316.813,"Councilmember Lewis, just double checking, you don't have anything to say?",82,,
480,0.97,3316.813,3318.481,"Mr. chair, I am all about it.",83,,
481,0.97,3318.481,3323.72,"This is great, thank you for your leadership and I'm looking forward to seeing this past.",83,,
482,0.97,3323.72,3331.428,"Before we vote, I want to take a moment to acknowledge this legislation will not have come together without Lish.",84,,
483,0.97,3331.428,3334.698,Lish has been enormously helpful every step of the way and I cannot thank you enough.,84,,
484,0.97,3334.698,3350.313,"With somebody big, urgent issues facing our city,--as we all know Childcare touches so many different issues from Affordability in our city to how equitable our neighborhoods are to how we support working parents and particularly working Moms.",84,,
485,0.97,3350.313,3359.656,Who disproportionately bear the impact of Childcare shortage.,84,,
486,0.97,3359.656,3363.56,I started working on this bill in January because addressing Childcare shortage is one of my top priorities.,84,,
487,0.97,3363.56,3371.067,"And today, Covid has made Childcare more important than it was six months ago.",84,,
488,0.97,3371.067,3374.337,We know that Childcare accessibility and Affordability are the two main issues that need to be addressed.,84,,
489,0.97,3374.337,3391.254,"And while this bill addresses part of the Assessability, it does not--it is one part of the solution, among many additional steps we need to take, to ensure that Childcare is affordable and Assessable to everyone.",84,,

560,0.97,3771.434,3772.468,"Council member Pedersen, take it away.",105,,
561,0.97,3772.468,3796.092,"I just want to thank chair Strauss, his office, also our staff, Ketil Freeman, for their diligent review of this 118 page bill and you know there's a lot, as chair Strauss has said, there is a lot going on with various crises and urgent matters.",106,,
562,0.97,3796.092,3802.465,"Yet we still have these committees, we still have the business of the city government to run here.",106,,
563,0.97,3802.465,3806.169,So I really appreciate the chair taking the lead on identifying things.,106,,
564,0.97,3806.169,3808.204,I just want to make general comments.,106,,
565,0.97,3808.204,3831.06,"To express my concern, the director report States that Seattle Department of construction inspections is responsible for routine maintenance of the Land-Use and other codes and proposed amount--amendments are omnibus amendments because it is packaged for efficiency that are relatively small-scale.",106,,
566,0.97,3831.06,3842.004,"Such amendments include relatively minor changes that don't warrant separate legislation, independent legislation, correct Typographical errors, etc.",106,,
567,0.97,3842.004,3849.445,Took the report at its word initially and assumed that everything in the bill was minor.,106,,
568,0.97,3849.445,3868.264,"I appreciate the due diligence from the legislative Department to look at this and I think the substitute is helping to--some additional, technical corrections as well is dealing with policy matters that can be dealt with later.",106,,
569,0.97,3868.264,3871.367,I will get to my amendment which is an additional item about landmark sites.,106,,
570,0.97,3871.367,3873.436,And I know that the chair has another amendment.,106,,
571,0.97,3873.436,3882.278,I really appreciate this process in the legislative Department to figure out what is in the bill and what may need to be fixed here.,106,,
572,0.97,3882.278,3886.782,"So thank you for the substitute, which I will be supporting.",106,,
573,0.97,3886.782,3891.887,Thank you Councilmember Edison.,107,,
574,0.97,3891.887,3892.455,Vice-Chair Mosqueda.,107,,
575,0.97,3892.455,3893.689,Thank you very much Mr.,108,,
576,0.97,3893.689,3893.923,Chair.,108,,
577,0.97,3893.923,3906.769,I did want--I did want to highlight a few pieces in the substitute because your office was very diligent in working with our office to include key components.,108,,
578,0.97,3906.769,3913.409,So wanted to highlight those also to lift up the good work being done by our teams at central staff if I might.,108,,
579,0.97,3913.409,3921.717,"On amendment number 3, which is the rear yard Unenclosed decks and Patios, this is something I'm really excited about.",108,,
580,0.97,3921.717,3935.331,It bubbles up on the conversations that we had last year on an amendment I sponsor to the Cantu Adu legislation to enable rooftop Patios.,108,,
581,0.97,3935.331,3952.949,"As we think about greater density across our city, recognizing that both townhouses and Rowhouses and, aye, Adu, rooftops can be a great place for families and individuals who have outdoor space.",108,,
582,0.97,3952.949,3954.216,They can be the new backyards.,108,,
583,0.97,3954.216,3958.054,They create density across the city and it is important for the health and livability of our community.,108,,
584,0.97,3958.054,3967.43,Where providing an opportunity to address spaces of people cannot plans and enjoy sitting on their Patios and increasing the livability of all housing options for all ages in our city.,108,,
585,0.97,3967.43,3993.389,"We heard from folks from the American Institute of architect, the Seattle chapter that there were additional follow-up changes that needed to happen to make it possible or enable rooftop Patios to be included on the Adu in Dadu and it includes a minor technical amendment that Codifies the intent of what we pass through the legislation last year.",108,,
586,0.97,3993.389,3999.895,"This amendment would allow for Unenclosed decks and rooftops, over Patios to extend into your yards where a Dadu is more likely to be in addition to finance.",108,,
587,0.97,3999.895,4013.909,"And again this technical amendment makes a great improvement in terms of enabling these spaces, these outdoor spaces for her Greenery and more play and live areas for families of all ages across our city.",108,,
588,0.97,4013.909,4021.617,Also would love to collect some of the work that was done on amendment number 5. this expands the downtown Tdr eligibility.,108,,
589,0.97,4021.617,4039.935,This amendment addresses a small but really important technical fix in the pros changes to the transfer of development rights or Tdr section of the omnibus bill.,108,,
590,0.97,4039.935,4049.045,"Tdr is a program that enables us to Incentivize density in areas we want to Encourag greater density such as in the downtown corridor in exchange for preservation of the historic properties, open space and vulnerable masonry structures through purchase of transfer of development rights.",108,,
591,0.97,4049.045,4053.449,So let's talk about the weeds for a second.,108,,
592,0.97,4053.449,4055.551,What this amendment actually does is look at a footnote.,108,,
593,0.97,4055.551,4066.962,There has been a footnote in the code that cited that the downtown retail corridor can only be used for Tdr from another site in the downtown retail corridor.,108,,
594,0.97,4066.962,4070.966,The practical problem is that Tdr is an functionally available from any downtown retail foresight.,108,,
595,0.97,4070.966,4084.18,The omnibus proposal in front of us Deletes this footnote so that projects in the downtown retail corridor are able to obtain transfer of developments right just like any downtown project could.,108,,
596,0.97,4084.18,4088.284,"This would apply to our project in the downtown retail core, going forward.",108,,
597,0.97,4088.284,4097.126,That's it pipeline projects are still without a solution because they don't have a bank transfer development sites to pull from.,108,,
598,0.97,4097.126,4124.22,"This amendment addresses pipeline projects I added language that Land-Use previously--Land-Use provisions apply that are in effect on the date of building permit issuance . In other words, these changes would apply to projects that are vested and in the pipeline but haven't bet obtained for transfer of development rights.",108,,
599,0.97,4124.22,4127.923,We want to encourage projects to participate in Tdr because we want to encourage density in these areas.,108,,
600,0.97,4127.923,4135.831,"And the Trade-Off between preservation of historic deputies, open stays and structures through the purchase of transfer of development rights is a win win.",108,,
601,0.97,4135.831,4139.635,Thank you for letting me get into the weeds on the and I appreciate your work on this.,108,,
602,0.97,4139.635,4142.304,"Thank you, vice chair.",109,,
603,0.97,4142.304,4161.824,"At this time, hearing no additional comments I would move to amend the 119835 by substituting version D 2 for D 1 as shown in the substituted amendment on the agenda.",109,,
604,0.97,4161.824,4162.625,Is there a second?,109,,
605,0.97,4162.625,4163.225,Second.,110,,
606,0.97,4163.225,4168.464,It has been moved and checked into a move--move the amendment to counsel bill 119835 as shown in the substitute amendment.,111,,
607,0.97,4168.464,4173.435,The clerk please call the role?,111,,
608,0.97,4173.435,4174.503,Vice-Chair Mosqueda?,112,,
609,0.97,4174.503,4175.771,Aye,113,,
610,0.97,4175.771,4176.872,Council member Lewis?,114,,
611,0.97,4176.872,4178.874,Aye,115,,
612,0.97,4178.874,4180.843,Comes member Lewis?,116,,
613,0.97,4180.843,4187.783,"Aye--four in favor, and oppose.",117,,
614,0.97,4187.783,4189.451,Motion carries.,117,,
615,0.97,4189.451,4203.265,"Amendment one, are less committee discussion expressed intent to work with advocates and affordable housing providers to amend the bike parking exemption proposed in the bill.",118,,
616,0.97,4203.265,4216.478,The amendment is the product of those discussions and would narrow the bike parking exemption to strike better balance between providing flexibility for housing providers and encouraging Biking as a means of transportation.,118,,
617,0.97,4216.478,4223.786,"Noah did the work, working with affordable housing providers and bike advocates.",118,,
618,0.97,4223.786,4224.186,"Thank you, Noah.",118,,
619,0.97,4224.186,4239.201,"Specifically this amendment would modify the blanket exemption for affordable housing and exempt affordable housing projects, to 30% of area median income for long-term bike parking requirements.",118,,
620,0.97,4239.201,4245.307,These are mostly permanent supportive housing projects.,118,,
621,0.97,4245.307,4266.295,"This amendment would also allow affordable housing projects for 30% to 60% of affordable median income to apply for a waiver from the requirements, if it increases affordable housing in reasonable alternatives provided.",118,,
622,0.97,4266.295,4282.978,"So this is that middle ground of affordable housing and I think that this amendment is important, this language is because it needs to demonstrate two issues pick--is greeted by the exemption and reasonable alternatives provided.",118,,
623,0.97,4282.978,4293.188,This would authorize a rule to fund reasonable alternatives and restore short-term parking requirements to all projects.,118,,
624,0.97,4293.188,4306.402,Short-term bike parking is essentially outdoors or in front or in the lobby where as long- term bike parking is typically a room within the building.,118,,
625,0.97,4306.402,4309.271,This also clarifies that nonprofit senior housing can apply for a similar waiver.,118,,
626,0.97,4309.271,4316.979,I have heard from many that seniors are not prone to Biking and I disagree.,118,,
627,0.97,4316.979,4318.614,"We have many electric bicycles, that get people moving.",118,,
628,0.97,4318.614,4323.185,"I have been beat by people older than me, while we are both writing electric bikes.",118,,
629,0.97,4323.185,4331.193,And there are even Trikes for folks that don't have good balance.,118,,
630,0.97,4331.193,4336.498,So I think that it is important that they waiver the application.,118,,
631,0.97,4336.498,4346.642,The amendment also NARROWS a provision intended to provide flexibility for bike parking access on slope parties.,118,,
632,0.97,4346.642,4350.312,So thank you to bike advocates and affordable housing providers who work with us to develop this compromise.,118,,
633,0.97,4350.312,4366.962,"Patrick Taylor and Rick advisory board, Brock Howell, Seattle neighborhood Greenways, the housing development consortium and Noah for coordinating.",118,,
634,0.97,4366.962,4368.964,"Ketil, did I Miss anything on the amendment?",118,,
635,0.97,4368.964,4369.965,"No, you did not.",119,,
636,0.97,4369.965,4370.432,That captured it.,119,,
637,0.97,4370.432,4371.033,Wonderful.,120,,
638,0.97,4371.033,4375.07,"So at this time unless I hear other comments for my colleagues, council member Pedersen, take it away.",120,,
639,0.97,4375.07,4380.776,Thank you chair Strauss for identifying this as an issue.,121,,
640,0.97,4380.776,4383.178,And my staff have been talking to bike advocates as well.,121,,
641,0.97,4383.178,4393.389,I'm glad you are able to synthesize the different principles we are trying to achieve here.,121,,
642,0.97,4393.389,4401.697,"It is getting people on the bikes, dealing with environmental climate change issues, at the same time trying to balance the desire to build affordable housing and the cost of building affordable housing.",121,,
643,0.97,4401.697,4409.404,I had a question for Ketil about--and also for addressing the senior housing as well.,121,,
644,0.97,4409.404,4417.112,One of the things we haven't talked about is--I had a question for Ketil about what the underlying bill is doing.,121,,
645,0.97,4417.112,4427.923,Is a relaxing bike parking requirements for profit rate developers?,121,,
646,0.97,4427.923,4430.325,"If so, how is it doing that?",121,,
647,0.97,4430.325,4441.637,It is not to--it makes some changes that are largely technical changes to the quantity of parking that can be required by market rate developers.,122,,
648,0.97,4441.637,4442.638,Bicycle parking.,122,,
649,0.97,4442.638,4445.474,But it does not make significant changes there.,122,,
650,0.97,4445.474,4456.452,"As chair Strauss mentioned, one of the changes had to do with less the quantity and more of the location and access to bicycle parking.",122,,
651,0.97,4456.452,4467.129,There is a provision on the proposed omnibus that would allow Off-Site--long-term parking for residential usage to be located outside.,122,,
652,0.97,4467.129,4481.343,"That was something the Council considered a couple of years ago and ultimately rejected, allowing it for commercial uses or nonresidential uses.",122,,
653,0.97,4481.343,4485.948,So that is a change that is incorporated into the omnibus that has more to do with location than access.,122,,
654,0.97,4485.948,4505.801,"As Councilmember Strauss mentioned, the bill as proposed, would have eliminated bicycle working requirements for affordable projects, projects with units of affordable housing if they met certain criteria for continued Affordability.",122,,
655,0.97,4505.801,4509.371,But those are the primary changes to quantity of parking.,122,,
656,0.97,4509.371,4531.093,"If I may follow-up, chair, if the residential market rate for profit residential projects is a change in location access, I mean, isn't that a benefit though that is being given to market rate developers to allow the location of the long-term parking to be Off-Site?",123,,
657,0.97,4531.093,4544.306,"And isn't it something--did I read it correctly, 600 feet which is basically three football fields away from the project?",123,,
658,0.97,4544.306,4545.307,"Yes, it is 600 feet.",124,,
659,0.97,4545.307,4556.051,And it has language that is similar to what is currently in the code for nonresidential uses which it is part of the campus.,124,,
660,0.97,4556.051,4572.935,"A couple of years ago when the Council was considering these changes, when the Council would allow Off-Site parking for nonresidential usage, the Council was thinking of things like Expedia campus or major institution campus, things like that.",124,,
661,0.97,4572.935,4577.172,"As a practical matter, there are not that many sites that are very large.",124,,
662,0.97,4577.172,4582.077,Were parking could be located 600 feet away.,124,,
663,0.97,4582.077,4593.455,For those that exist this would allow a barking parking room to be located on a functionally interrelated campus that includes usage.,124,,
664,0.97,4593.455,4594.456,Thank you very much.,125,,
665,0.97,4594.456,4598.293,I want to thank Vicki Clark for her connecting with the office on this.,125,,
666,0.97,4598.293,4605.4,"Thank you, chair.",125,,
667,0.97,4605.4,4606.635,Thank you Council member Pedersen.,126,,
668,0.97,4606.635,4611.473,That is a great question and I appreciate the additional clarification from Ketil noting the campus must be interconnected.,126,,
669,0.97,4611.473,4629.157,"Uw Madison, South Lake Union, Expedia, there has to be Interconnectivity between the buildings that are being served.",126,,
670,0.97,4629.157,4631.627,That is helpful context and answers a Questio that I also had.,126,,
671,0.97,4631.627,4633.228,"Council member Pedersen, thanks for asking.",126,,
672,0.97,4633.228,4634.496,Excellent.,126,,
673,0.97,4634.496,4635.697,"Vice-Chair Mosqueda, please take it away.",126,,
674,0.97,4635.697,4637.132,Thank you Mr. chair.,127,,
675,0.97,4637.132,4648.11,I was happy when you talked about Expedia's parking.,127,,
676,0.97,4648.11,4649.611,I visited that campus and it is exciting.,127,,
677,0.97,4649.611,4653.415,I'm looking forward to the next Iteration of how they populate the building because it is so great.,127,,
678,0.97,4653.415,4663.725,It is going to be a really great incentive for people to bike to work.,127,,
679,0.97,4663.725,4665.36,I just want to comment on this amendment.,127,,
680,0.97,4665.36,4666.695,I just want to think your office.,127,,
681,0.97,4666.695,4670.832,This was sent down as an omnibus bill and a lot of Stakeholders flagged that it was a policy change.,127,,
682,0.97,4670.832,4679.975,I think that you have really helped to I think fix the issues that were generated from the need for additional Stakeholder and before we sat down and you did tremendous work to bring folks together.,127,,
683,0.97,4679.975,4681.777,I want to thank you for the hard work.,127,,
684,0.97,4681.777,4682.978,I'm very supportive of these amendments.,127,,
685,0.97,4682.978,4683.845,I think it makes sense.,127,,
686,0.97,4683.845,4689.584,They tailored to the different types of affordable housing sites and you have created a creative solution to make sure that it is not just a One-Size- Fits-All.,127,,
687,0.97,4689.584,4690.886,In the amendment provides stability.,127,,
688,0.97,4690.886,4696.391,So that we are providing appropriate places for people to include their bikes.,127,,
689,0.97,4696.391,4700.095,Whether that is supportive housing or in senior housing.,127,,
690,0.97,4700.095,4710.405,Looking for opportunities for folks to have their bikes on sites and whether that means vertebral hooks or on-site units or within the building in other places.,127,,
691,0.97,4710.405,4728.523,We have continue to try to ensure that this Multimodal option is not only relegated to one corner but is built into the fabric of these buildings and making it more accessible option for our community.,127,,
692,0.97,4728.523,4732.394,It not only helps livability of those in the region but also helps our livability as a globe.,127,,
693,0.97,4732.394,4735.23,"It is good for our environment, thank you for your hard work on this.",127,,
694,0.97,4735.23,4737.199,I appreciate your diligence on the details.,127,,
695,0.97,4737.199,4742.404,"Thank you, Vice-Chair Mosqueda.",128,,
696,0.97,4742.404,4744.506,"If there are no further comments, thank you for calling that.",128,,
697,0.97,4744.506,4747.008,I will give all credit to know what in my office.,128,,
698,0.97,4747.008,4752.447,For moving all of those people closer together to compromise.,128,,
699,0.97,4752.447,4758.753,If there are no further comments I would move to amend Council bill 119835 as shown on the agenda.,128,,
700,0.97,4758.753,4763.258,Amendment 1. is there a second?,128,,
701,0.97,4763.258,4763.859,Second.,129,,
702,0.97,4763.859,4765.06,Thank you Council member Pedersen.,130,,
703,0.97,4765.06,4770.966,It is moved and Seconded to amend Council bill 119835.,130,,
704,0.97,4770.966,4774.269,"With amendment 1 shown on the agenda, will lurk call the role?",130,,
705,0.97,4794.022,4795.59,Four in favor come in and oppose.,131,,
706,0.97,4795.59,4796.391,Thank you collects.,132,,
707,0.97,4796.391,4796.992,The motion carries.,132,,
708,0.97,4796.992,4799.594,It is my understanding that there is an additional walk on amendment.,132,,
709,0.97,4799.594,4801.663,"Councilmember Pedersen, would you like to speak to that?",132,,
710,0.97,4801.663,4802.063,Yes.,133,,
711,0.97,4802.063,4802.664,Thank you.,133,,
712,0.97,4802.664,4807.335,Could I ask Ketil to describe it and then I can talk about the intense.,133,,
713,0.97,4807.335,4828.223,"Just for context, as flagged in the memo last week, the omnibus adds new language that would be landmark sites, not just landmark structures eligible for use dispensation and single-family zones through an administrative process.",134,,
714,0.97,4828.223,4845.941,The conditional use process is a type to use with discretionary--appeal to the hearing Examiner.,134,,
715,0.97,4845.941,4854.049,Councilmember Pedersen's amendment removes the language proposed in the omnibus and authorize SDC I threw the conditional use process on then makes--landmark sites.,134,,
716,0.97,4854.049,4866.461,"Thank you, Ketil . This amendment would basically just bring us back to what it is today.",135,,
717,0.97,4866.461,4873.768,"As I mentioned, earlier in their marks some concern with 118 page bill they had substantive matters in policy matters, not just technical corrections.",135,,
718,0.97,4873.768,4882.677,We were able to identify some of those and that is why we passed the substitute.,135,,
719,0.97,4882.677,4889.15,"That is why we had the bike amendment and now there is this amendment to basically go back to what it is today, which is to allow that authority for landmark structures.",135,,
720,0.97,4889.15,4915.41,"But to remove the expansion, the White expansion to include landmark sites because I think this is a situation where we don't want to have this legislation undermined the authority that the landmark reservation board, which is its own process.",135,,
721,0.97,4915.41,4919.781,And this is something that the Seattle Department of construction and inspection really wants to do any city for some reason.,135,,
722,0.97,4919.781,4921.95,They can just bring it as a different piece of legislation.,135,,
723,0.97,4921.95,4924.352,But I feel it is inappropriate for the omnibus technical corrections.,135,,
724,0.97,4924.352,4926.821,It is potentially undermining the landmark Preservtion board authority and should be removed.,135,,
725,0.97,4926.821,4928.189,That is what this amendment does.,135,,
726,0.97,4928.189,4928.49,Thank you.,135,,
727,0.97,4928.49,4936.931,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",136,,
728,0.97,4936.931,4940.068,"Ketil, I was not briefed on this amendment in depth before the committee hearing.",136,,
729,0.97,4940.068,4943.438,I do have--I typically Reserve these types of questions for briefings.,136,,
730,0.97,4943.438,4951.146,"As we are having the experience here on the dais today, I want to double check my assumptions from the briefing you just provided here.",136,,
731,0.97,4951.146,4964.159,"It sounds as if, even without Councilmember Pedersen's amendment, there--the process retains a conditional permitting process that requires public input.",136,,
732,0.97,4964.159,4974.102,"The full permitting process, that is similar to the Childcare conditional permit, that we just removed from child care.",136,,
733,0.97,4974.102,4979.574,So this adds a permitting process to allow different uses on historical side.,136,,
734,0.97,4979.574,4983.845,Is that correct?,136,,
735,0.97,4983.845,4984.279,Yes.,137,,
736,0.97,4984.279,4986.448,"The current process, the permitting process is already there.",137,,
737,0.97,4986.448,4992.687,The administrative conditional use process is there for use dispensation for landmark structures.,137,,
738,0.97,4992.687,5005.7,The criteria that is used in granting the use dispensation Lee is whether or not the use is compatible with existing design or construction of the structure.,137,,
739,0.97,5005.7,5024.919,It is allowed now and applicant also had to demonstrate that the use will be detrimental to other properties or the public interest and the use--other uses that would otherwise be allowed in the zone and being provided because of the nature of the structure.,137,,
740,0.97,5024.919,5033.428,So those are the criteria.,137,,
741,0.97,5033.428,5037.432,That Stci uses currently for structures.,137,,
742,0.97,5037.432,5044.406,Vice-Chair Mosqueda I have a few more questions and then I will come back to you.,138,,
743,0.97,5044.406,5049.043,I was wondering if the screen could be shared so we could look at it while the questions are being asked.,139,,
744,0.97,5049.043,5049.644,"Yes, absolutely.",140,,
745,0.97,5049.644,5057.752,I try to share my screen.,141,,
746,0.97,5057.752,5060.155,", sharing the right thing?",141,,
747,0.97,5060.155,5073.435,If you could enlarge or zoom in to--it is very small.,142,,
748,0.97,5073.435,5079.741,Here we go.,143,,
749,0.97,5079.741,5090.285,I will zoom in . I will see if it allows me to.,143,,
750,0.97,5090.285,5090.885,Here we go.,143,,
751,0.97,5090.885,5093.087,Can you see that?,143,,
752,0.97,5093.087,5097.292,Amendment 2 to CB 119835.,143,,
753,0.97,5097.292,5101.229,Thank you for answering the last question.,144,,
754,0.97,5101.229,5109.771,"It sounds as if there is a road put, even with allowing different uses to be used on a historical site.",144,,
755,0.97,5109.771,5123.384,"It has to demonstrate that it will not infringe upon any of the structures, change the structures and that there is a robust process.",144,,
756,0.97,5123.384,5132.026,"Are the preservation boards that are associated with overseeing these historic sites, will they be part of this conditional permitting process?",144,,
757,0.97,5132.026,5150.044,Do they have input that is the E Department of construction and land use.,144,,
758,0.97,5150.044,5157.051,The director is which ever land use planner is assigned to the administration.,144,,
759,0.97,5157.051,5166.294,There is nothing in here that compels any kind of consultation with the landmark's preservation board.,144,,
760,0.97,5166.294,5177.272,"They would need to weigh in but how that is sequenced, how the two decisions inform each other, I can't answer that question right now.",144,,
761,0.97,5177.272,5178.473,Thank you.,145,,
762,0.97,5178.473,5191.753,"Just confirming makes no structural changes, makes sure nothing can be--that no detrimental uses of the space would be allowed.",145,,
763,0.97,5191.753,5192.02,Right.,146,,
764,0.97,5192.02,5196.424,There is some discretion afforded to them in making that determination.,146,,
765,0.97,5196.424,5196.758,Thank you.,147,,
766,0.97,5196.758,5202.33,What we are--help me--I'm going to kind of put it in plain language.,147,,
767,0.97,5202.33,5204.299,Help me if I'm not hitting this on the head.,147,,
768,0.97,5204.299,5220.481,What we are talking about here is if there is a historical site in a single family zone that conditional permit process would have to--be engaged in to allow things like weddings or --,147,,
769,0.97,5220.481,5225.153,"No, it could--it would not be for things like that.",148,,
770,0.97,5225.153,5227.989,Not those kind of activities necessarily.,148,,
771,0.97,5227.989,5231.559,Those can happen in institutions in single family zones right now.,148,,
772,0.97,5231.559,5238.533,I think the problem this is seeking to address has to do with accessory uses that might be allowed in a structure.,148,,
773,0.97,5238.533,5255.25,"If there is for example a commercial use that is authorized through--the administrative conditional use process, um--for a structure, an applicant may have difficulty in getting accessory uses located on the site to support that principle use.",148,,
774,0.97,5255.25,5258.853,I think that is what this is intended to address.,148,,
775,0.97,5258.853,5263.725,"I don't know--if you have any thoughts on this, you could Chime in.",148,,
776,0.97,5263.725,5264.359,That might be helpful.,148,,
777,0.97,5264.359,5271.532,I think that is primarily what this is intended to address.,148,,
778,0.97,5271.532,5281.409,It seems like as a policy matter if this was something the counsel wanted to pursue it should apply in multi-family and commercial zones as well.,148,,
779,0.97,5281.409,5284.412,"Mike, do you have any thoughts to share?",149,,
780,0.97,5284.412,5290.184,I would concur with the--the example that Ketil just provided.,150,,
781,0.97,5290.184,5305.099,The thing that has been questioned for--of interpretation in our use of these provisions in the past has been what do we do with things that are not--[Indiscernible] like accessory parking which goes to the example that Ketil was speaking to.,150,,
782,0.97,5305.099,5309.203,Um--we had not intended for this to be a policy change.,150,,
783,0.97,5309.203,5313.841,We thought that--the changes we had proposed would be Clarifications.,150,,
784,0.97,5313.841,5324.319,We understand the questions that have come up with this and the desire potentially on the part of committee members for us to do some more analysis on this and some outreach.,150,,
785,0.97,5324.319,5326.788,We would be happy Reverting to the existing language.,150,,
786,0.97,5326.788,5336.898,I would just mention that as a business practice we coordinate very closely with the Department of--[Indiscernible],150,,
787,0.97,5337.031,5343.738,Thank you.,151,,
788,0.97,5343.738,5344.439,"Very helpful, Mike.",151,,
789,0.97,5344.439,5345.807,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",152,,
790,0.97,5345.807,5357.585,"I think along the similar line of questions that you had and having just been in a position where amendments get walked on, I get the position you are in as you are chairing.",152,,
791,0.97,5357.585,5365.793,It is not an easy task and I will be working on improving that process moving forward.,152,,
792,0.97,5365.793,5370.398,Mr. chair I appreciate the line of questions you just had to me.,152,,
793,0.97,5370.398,5383.044,That means really when I--when I look at what the languages in front of us and the questions you just asked seems like--a site with a landmark that is restricted because of that landmark already.,152,,
794,0.97,5383.044,5386.481,So there should be some flexibility for how the rest of the site is used.,152,,
795,0.97,5386.481,5397.458,"For example, if we want to consider building housing an things like we have been discussing throughout this committee over the last few months, and its already a conditional use.",152,,
796,0.97,5397.458,5409.604,"It goes through careful sites specific of you for that, Mr. chair and to the sponsor I don't think I will be able to support this change today.",152,,
797,0.97,5409.604,5412.774,"Thank you, vice chair.",153,,
798,0.97,5412.774,5416.411,Thank you.,154,,
799,0.97,5416.411,5420.181,I appreciate Stci recognizing they may need to do more outreach and work on this.,154,,
800,0.97,5420.181,5423.184,Really this amendment is not making a policy decision.,154,,
801,0.97,5423.184,5471.666,"This amendment is simply enabling the process to occur where there is more robust engagement about what is a policy change and--I guess what I'm concerned with a couple of things is it is really--hitting these two agencies against each other and I think that needs to be resolved and dealt with Offline and--so we can hear from landmarks, folks about this change to their--realm, their policy area and also I guess--it is my understanding this conditional use process isn't that just--a desk review by--somebody on Stci staff who is just reading E-Mails that come in for comment?",154,,
802,0.97,5471.666,5503.931,"It is not an actual--robust public discussion about that approval for that and I'm just trying to get this to a place where we can have more community engagement and there are lots of things in this 118 page bill and I think all we are doing is trimming this item, that is potentially controversial and put a couple of agencies together we want to resolve that had a more methodical manner.",154,,
803,0.97,5503.931,5506.4,It is not making a policy decision.,154,,
804,0.97,5506.4,5514.475,It is allowing the process to occur outside of this what--this 118 page bill.,154,,
805,0.97,5514.475,5527.321,If I could I would like to clarify we didn't work closely with them and that they are supportive of this set of amendments here as they were proposed.,155,,
806,0.97,5527.321,5536.697,So there has been very robust consideration of their needs.,155,,

808,0.97,5540.034,5552.113,I--I am also just struggling with needing a little bit more input from about this.,156,,
809,0.97,5552.113,5585.379,Itseems--just on its base as I'm sitting here being briefed for the first time does seem to me that there--this simply allows flexibility in what is already a historic--a historic designation which requires a process of creating that historic space and then there is a process for allowing uses within the space and then this is a conditional permit in addition to that that would allow a different use that is not allowed in a single family zone.,156,,
810,0.97,5585.379,5602.63,"I am wondering if the sponsor of this amendment, if you would be willing to hold this till Monday so we can get a little bit--get additional outreach and so I can better understand the implications of this amendment.",156,,

841,0.97,5765.926,5777.671,"It requires when there are changes made that are new to the bill, so something that the public couldn't have reasonably testified about at the public hearing, an additional comment period may be required.",172,,

844,0.97,5785.513,5795.99,If one is required here that probably means a full counsel vote will not happen till--after the counselor returns from process in September.,172,,
