152,0.97,1338.77,1339.638,"Great, thank you so much.",38,,
153,0.97,1339.638,1350.449,"So if there are no further questions, checking it out, I would like to move appointment 01545 and the other one, we don't have, Yeah, 01547.",39,,
154,0.97,1352.05,1352.651,Second.,40,,
155,0.97,1352.651,1353.018,Thank you.,41,,
156,0.97,1353.018,1353.952,"All in favor, vote aye.",42,,
157,0.97,1353.952,1358.29,"None opposed, these two appointments will move to the full Council on Monday, and thank you again for your time.",43,,
158,0.97,1358.29,1359.858,Appreciate it.,44,,
159,0.97,1359.858,1362.661,Thank you.,45,,
160,0.97,1364.129,1364.796,Item number three.,46,,
161,0.97,1364.796,1366.765,2020 office Inspector General work plan.,47,,
162,0.97,1370.168,1371.67,"Thank you, Alex.",48,,
163,0.97,1372.27,1375.741,"If you folks want to join us at the table, that would be great.",49,,
164,0.97,1402.267,1403.168,"Greetings, good morning.",50,,
165,0.97,1403.168,1407.072,"Can we start with quick introductions, and then we will talk about what we are doing here?",50,,
166,0.97,1413.211,1413.912,Good morning.,51,,
167,0.97,1413.912,1415.38,"Lisa judge, Inspector General for public safety.",52,,
168,0.97,1415.38,1419.084,Thank you for the time to come ere and talk to you about our work plan for 2020.,52,,
169,0.97,1419.084,1420.685,Amy Tsa I office of Inspector general.,53,,
170,0.97,1420.685,1448.513,"I think this is an important part of organizing your work, the annual work plan, and it's also--I appreciate having the opportunity to allow myself, my colleagues, and the members of the public to hear from you, and we can get well grounded in the priorities of your office for this year.",54,,
171,0.97,1448.513,1489.087,"It's a really important part of our accountability system, and one of the three legs of the stool, and it's civilian led, and the fact that all three of our accountability stool legs are civilian led, I think it is part of the strength of the system, and the focus your office has to continuous improvement is what will keep us strength--keep us strong, grounded in the principles of reform moving forward.",54,,
172,0.97,1489.087,1490.755,Thank you so much for being here.,54,,
173,0.97,1490.755,1491.122,Thank you.,55,,
174,0.97,1491.122,1498.43,"I think the way I would like to start off, and there's a lot of information thrown at you, and we only have 25 minutes.",55,,
175,0.97,1498.43,1512.777,"Amy will start us off with a little the bit of background for the newer members who haven't had as much exposure to the office, and I will talk about the work we are wrapping up for 2019 and what's on tap for 2020.",55,,
176,0.97,1512.777,1520.886,Amy will get us started with a Powerpoint presentation.,55,,
177,0.97,1520.886,1522.42,It will help us the discussion today.,55,,
178,0.97,1522.42,1553.285,"I would like to start with a brief highlight, and I'm sure you outlined the role of the O.I.G., but the accountability partners, you heard from the community police Commission this morning, and also the office of police accountability, chose charge is investigations of allegations of individual officer misconduct, and then the officer of Inspector General has the overlook of looking at the entire system and ensuring the system as a whole is performing as it should.",56,,
179,0.97,1553.285,1566.798,"All of these three entities exist together for the purpose of ensuring constitutional effective, respectful policing, all with the goal of public trust and being accountable to the community.",56,,
180,0.97,1566.798,1601.266,"We are waiting on that slide up there, and moving on f you're following along in your packets, Councilmember, the next Collide, the office was created as part of the legislation in 2017, and in 2018, Inspector General judge was appointed in Mid-2018 of that year, and so, last year 2019 reflected the first full year of operation of the office, and there will be an annual report coming out in the next couple of months, and so, here today, Inspector General judge is here to talk about the 2020 work plan.",56,,
181,0.97,1601.266,1602.3,Thank you for that.,57,,
182,0.97,1602.3,1649.447,"Thank you, I think we are still waiting for the slides to catch up with us, but if you will turn to the next page, I want to talk briefly about the areas of work and basically those are tied very much to the the authorities and duties that the office has been assigned, both from the ordinance and from just, I think, the nature of our work, and we are charged with SPD oversight, Opd oversight, and recommending system improvements, and eventually ensuring that public safety here in Seattle remains true to the consent decree reforms that have been instituted, and we keep a constant mind set of innovation and Mindfulness for law enforcement and relationships with the community.",58,,
183,0.97,1649.447,1651.583,How do we go about doing that?,58,,
184,0.97,1651.583,1657.989,The largest bodies of work with audits and reviews of the Seattle police Department.,58,,
185,0.97,1657.989,1665.93,"You will see, as we move through, and I talk about how we are staffed, we are heavily staffed in the audit Functio.",58,,
186,0.97,1665.93,1708.039,"I think that's one of the critical areas in which we can provide data and information to ensure that we have got appropriate systems for oversight, and they are effective and things are happening in a way that community and the Stakeholders are wanting that to happen, and so we also engage in policy work, and we have got currently two policy analysts, and one of the slots will be vacating soon, and that's important in informing our work in terms of what is the best practice around the country and in working and providing technical stance to the SPD and OPA with their policy development.",58,,
187,0.97,1708.039,1732.897,"We respond to OPA's significant incidents, and one of the things we are hoping to develop a robust system for is evaluating the critical systems that happen within SPD with an eye towards including community, community voicing and involvement in the assessment, and providing ways in which the systems contribute to negative significant events can be improved.",58,,
188,0.97,1732.897,1755.92,"One of the really big duties that Amy and I have is doing a lot of collaboration with our system partners and outside stake holders to make sure that we are taking into account the interests of community and stake holders in our work, and we are working with SPD to implement those recommendations.",58,,
189,0.97,1755.92,1777.642,"And as it relates to the first bullet under mechanisms, the audits and reviews of SPD and OPA, you don't just review investigations after the fact?",59,,
190,0.97,1779.911,1794.459,"You are able to kind of review the investigations as they are transpiring, and if you see there is something, they maybe a witness who wasn't interviewed, you have that relationship with the investigative arm to make course correction recommendations, is that accurate?",59,,
191,0.97,1794.459,1828.459,"Yeah, I want to be clear, I think we are talking mostly like Officer-Involved shootings and scenes of significance to the community, and we are one of the civilian folks who are allowed to enter the scene to observe what is going on with the investigation to talk with investigators, and that's changing a little bit with the I-940 implementation, but Seattle police Department and OPA have been very collaborative and welcoming to have the extra set of eyes and ears on the scene.",60,,
192,0.97,1828.459,1840.305,"That's one of our functions, and we do have a partnership with that we can identify areas we think, you know, in real time, on the spot need a little bit of attention.",60,,
193,0.97,1840.305,1841.372,"Great, thank you.",61,,
194,0.97,1841.372,1842.04,Can I --,62,,
195,0.97,1842.04,1842.574,I'm sorry.,63,,
196,0.97,1842.574,1846.578,Go for it.,64,,
197,0.97,1846.578,1865.663,"The last two bullets you said something about evaluating the incidents with an eye towards community input or community engagement, and then talked about collaborating with community, can you give examples of how you engage or receive community input for these processes?",65,,
198,0.97,1865.663,1875.506,"Yeah, I think maybe we are Conflating a couple of the projects.",66,,
199,0.97,1875.506,1930.762,"The special project section is something I refer to as centennial review it would essentially take a very hard, critical, systemic review of the Officer-Involved shooting, a pursuit that ended in a fatality, maybe mass arrests, something of significant community concern, and I will talk about that later, and that's one of the ways in which I think community voice and involvement is important, and in taking a look at the police practices, and I come from a jurisdiction that was not afraid of involving the community in the conversation about policing and how it happens and how force is investigated and reviewed, and so Ideally, that's where I would like to move our work, to that area.",66,,
200,0.97,1930.762,1945.076,"The other things we do, we regularly attend CPC meetings, regular meetings with outside Stakeholders like ACLU, and innocence Washington, and other groups like that, we attend the community events.",66,,
201,0.97,1945.076,1957.255,"I'm going to talk a little the bit about the youth engagement E are hoping to get going very soon with my office, and those are some of the ways in which we solicit community input.",66,,
202,0.97,1957.255,1957.689,Thank you.,67,,
203,0.97,1957.689,1989.253,"We identify projects we would like to audit, and some of those projects come to us from community concerns, community input, and once we have identified an audit topic, we try to identify Stakeholders who may have an interest in the particular topic and go and sit down and talk to them, make sure we are asking the right questions because one of the main benefits of having our office doing the reviews of the processes, we can ask the questions that Stakeholders have and that the community has.",68,,
204,0.97,1989.253,1995.159,We are make sure we are turning over all the right rocks and getting out the right issues.,68,,
205,0.97,1995.159,1996.461,Thank you.,69,,
206,0.97,1996.461,1997.295,"Yeah, thank you.",70,,
207,0.97,1997.295,2012.443,"So the next slide will talk a little bit, and you will notice the nice colors that Amy and my folks have put in there, and they tie to the areas of our mechanisms of providing oversight.",70,,
208,0.97,2012.443,2032.397,"When you see, on the bubble slide, the previous bubble slide, something in green, policy, and you will see the staffing we have assigned to the areas this is a very general idea of how we are staffed and how the staff is decided up for work areas.",70,,
209,0.97,2032.397,2036.501,The auditing section is the most heavily staffed.,70,,
210,0.97,2036.501,2046.377,Folks in blue are largely doing OPA review.,70,,
211,0.97,2046.377,2053.451,"Conflict investigations of OPA when they cannot do the investigation themselves, and in green, policy folks.",70,,
212,0.97,2053.451,2055.72,Any questions about--I'm sorry.,70,,
213,0.97,2055.72,2058.656,You may have covered this.,70,,
214,0.97,2058.656,2063.928,There are a number of gray boxes.,70,,
215,0.97,2063.928,2064.195,Uh-uh.,71,,
216,0.97,2064.195,2073.504,And they look like they are--so the gray does not actually correspond to one of the colors on the previous page?,72,,
217,0.97,2073.504,2074.372,It means vacant?,72,,
218,0.97,2074.372,2075.64,"Correct, yes.",73,,
219,0.97,2075.64,2083.514,I was looking for the color corresponding to outreach.,74,,
220,0.97,2083.514,2087.218,You will probably notice there's no dedicated outreach person there.,75,,
221,0.97,2087.218,2116.08,"We have been doing--we have sort of been spreading that function around with certain members of our office, I try to do my part with stake holders and with community getting out to meetings, and we have had to sort of sacrifice a dedicated outreach and engagement function so that we can have an Appropriately-Staffed audit and policy function to get up and running.",75,,
222,0.97,2116.08,2126.324,"We have only been operational for a year, and the whole first six months was hiring International staff, getting an office building.",75,,
223,0.97,2126.324,2130.261,We just moved into the permanent office space 2 weeks ago.,75,,
224,0.97,2130.261,2168.232,"It's been a building process, and eventually, with the appropriate budgeting and staffing, we would have a dedicated engagement and outreach person, and I think that it is very important in both identifying topics, identifying issues that are important to the community, and communicating back to the community the work we have done and just educating folks about our role in the system and the system in general, and it's very critical, but that is a place that you will notice is not--does not have a dedicated staff appointed.",75,,
225,0.97,2168.232,2171.702,We are on track for filling the vacant positions?,76,,
226,0.97,2171.702,2172.837,We are.,77,,
227,0.97,2172.837,2175.306,It's a process for us.,77,,
228,0.97,2175.306,2181.145,They have to pass background checks and go through clearances to get access to criminal justice information.,77,,
229,0.97,2181.145,2197.929,"We are in the process of hiring for the vacant auditor position, and probably in the next 2-3 months, hiring the other auditor position for the supervisor, the policy analyst and Admin we are about to launch those as well.",77,,
230,0.97,2197.929,2205.403,"If everything goes as planned, by June I would Ideally have an entire staff of folks.",77,,
231,0.97,2205.403,2214.612,"Can I just clarify, you have four funded but vacant positions, and then there is a desire for an outreach position that is not funded?",78,,
232,0.97,2214.612,2223.955,"Correct, and I would just say there is an ongoing desire for more auditors.",79,,
233,0.97,2223.955,2247.912,"I think it's always going to be something that is in our near term planning, just because of the size of the Seattle police Department, and I think you will see there's a list of horizon topics, not part of the presentation today, but if we had additional staff, there's so many other things we could be doing in terms of performance audits and assisting with compliance auditing.",79,,
234,0.97,2247.912,2248.312,Thank you.,80,,
235,0.97,2248.312,2248.679,Sure.,81,,
236,0.97,2248.679,2255.286,"The next slide, really just talking about the standards we have for conducting our audits and reporting.",82,,
237,0.97,2255.286,2258.923,"We are one of, I think one of the few O.I.G.",82,,
238,0.97,2258.923,2268.399,"Offices in the law enforcement context that uses Gaga standards, generally accepted government auditing standards, the yellow book method.",82,,
239,0.97,2268.399,2271.369,"It's very labor intensive, and it takes time.",82,,
240,0.97,2271.369,2302.333,"It makes an audit process seem like it's taking a lot longer than perhaps it should, but there's a lot of quality control checks, and there's a mandate for independence, and on the work product end of it, I think it produce as report that can withstand peer review, withstand the scrutiny from really anybody who looks at it.",82,,
241,0.97,2302.333,2304.969,"It's independent, fair, and Ojective in the process.",82,,
242,0.97,2304.969,2316.447,"It also provides certainty to the folks with Reauditing, they know we will sit down, be methodical as we go through.",82,,
243,0.97,2316.447,2326.824,"We will try to produce a fair result in consultation with them, and it will be a report that is transparent and available to anyone who wants to read it.",82,,
244,0.97,2338.135,2342.106,"Just talking a little bit about how we select a project, I think I talked about it a bit.",82,,
245,0.97,2342.106,2362.86,"Coming from a variety of sources, our own observations, and from other people, occasionally the chief of police will make a request for an audit, and we have had members of the Department, now, actually, formally request we audit their sections because we have a high degree of trust with our partners, and it comes from Stakeholders like CPC, and other folks.",82,,
246,0.97,2362.86,2373.504,"Once we have identified topics, we go through a risk assessment process, and we look at, with the topic, what is the risk, if there's something going wrong, what is the risk?",82,,
247,0.97,2373.504,2375.406,And the impact?,82,,
248,0.97,2375.406,2381.112,"You know, the likelihood of the risk, and the impact if something really went wrong.",82,,
249,0.97,2381.112,2400.564,"We Prioritize in that way, and we figure out if we have the appropriate staffing and resources to do the particular audit, and then we start to meet with stake holders and others to see how we stake the audit.",82,,
250,0.97,2400.564,2404.969,The greater the risk the more likelihood you will take the project?,83,,
251,0.97,2404.969,2419.683,"The higher the risk and the more likelihood if the negative--if the risk is realized the community of the agency and Stakeholders, we take all that into account.",84,,
252,0.97,2419.683,2423.187,Just talking a little bit about what is going on right now.,84,,
253,0.97,2423.187,2451.348,"We have two audits mandated to be Reoccurring by ordinance, and that's a surveillance review, and that's of technology, and we--because of the lag time in the surveillance technology process itself, we have not had much to review, but that's one of our functions and the intelligence audit is our obligation to look at how SPD collects and manages intelligence information to make sure they are following the ordinance.",84,,
254,0.97,2451.348,2456.12,"We did a review of that last year formally, and we have an ongoing review process.",84,,
255,0.97,2456.12,2465.463,"Can you say a few words for the viewing public what the intelligence ordinance is, what you're looking at.",85,,
256,0.97,2465.463,2466.096,Sure.,86,,
257,0.97,2466.096,2470.1,It is--Unfortunately it's a bit antiquated.,86,,
258,0.97,2470.1,2477.241,"It was adopted in the '70s before social media, the Internet, and technology was as widespread as it is.",86,,
259,0.97,2477.241,2504.435,"It was meant to put some restrictions around how the police Department collected and maintained information about religious affiliation, political affiliation, and sexual orientation and sexual practices, and it's essentially a person's private information, has protections in how SPD, you know, gathers information about it and keeps it.",86,,
260,0.97,2504.435,2507.438,Is that sufficient for you?,86,,
261,0.97,2507.438,2507.638,Okay.,86,,
262,0.97,2507.638,2513.11,"So one thing I would like to mention, Amy mentioned it in her second slide.",86,,
263,0.97,2513.11,2531.829,"We have got a year-end report coming out, probably at the end of Q1, and it will talk about the work we did in 2019, and it will reference these are occurring audits, and there's a lot more information that will be coming out in the Wrapup.",86,,
264,0.97,2531.829,2556.82,"So projects we have that began in late 2019 that are set to wrap up are an audit of SPD's K- 9 unit, and that's really a look at the entire operation of the unit, training, supervision, how they do Recordkeeping, how they investigation force, and it's a fairly comprehensive look at the K-9 unit that should be out right around the end of March, end of Q1.",86,,
265,0.97,2556.82,2604.401,"We are looking at, it's called a mutual aid audit, but it's a look at any time an SPD officer is working outside of a normal SPD chain of command, on a task force, or working, providing assistance to another agency close by, and we want to look at whether they are following SPD policy, how they are reporting things like force, interactions with persons and mental health crisis, and things like that that get scrutiny and attention within the SPD system but are perhaps unknown once they are working outside of a normal SPD structure, and then, the last one is an issue of DNA destruction.",86,,
266,0.97,2604.401,2610.841,"Inadvertent of destruction of samples in the evidence section, requested by the chief.",86,,
267,0.97,2610.841,2616.547,"It's ongoing, and it should be finishing up around Q1, beginning of Q2.",86,,
268,0.97,2616.547,2624.588,Questions about those?,86,,
269,0.97,2626.423,2650.481,"Okay, so what we have got, getting set to start this year, major performance audits, and we plan to start with an audit of the appeals process, identified largely because it's very much of interest to the court and to the city and others over compliance decree and demonstration of around the accountability system and how effective it is in Seattle right now.",86,,
270,0.97,2650.481,2656.053,We thought it was significant to take on right away.,86,,
271,0.97,2656.053,2681.278,Particularly my recollection is there's been an interest in the focus on the part of the disciplinary process that in some cases continues past the OPA's recommendation and the chief's determination on the appeals?,87,,
272,0.97,2681.278,2685.249,Process?,87,,
273,0.97,2685.249,2685.916,Yes.,88,,
274,0.97,2685.916,2693.924,"It isn't a as much known about it, and so I believe you're going to sort of do a road map of what the process is and a review of past cases, more or less correct?",89,,
275,0.97,2693.924,2694.658,More or less.,90,,
276,0.97,2694.658,2697.027,We have already done the mapping of the process.,90,,
277,0.97,2697.027,2714.211,"Our policy folks did a fairly substantial, and I think impressive bit of work in the mapping from the time the complaint comes in, and Whoever through the entire process until an appeal has been heard and decided.",90,,
278,0.97,2714.211,2748.879,"The entire process has been mapped so we could educate ourselves and educate stake holders and educate the community about the process itself, and now we are going to undertake the process of trying to understand whether that is effective, meeting the goals that the SPD and community hope, and whether there's improvements that can be made in the process, gaps, inefficiencies or problems that need to be addressed in some way.",90,,
279,0.97,2748.879,2750.347,"Yeah, that's part two of the process.",90,,
280,0.97,2750.347,2754.384,What's the time line for that one?,91,,
281,0.97,2754.384,2762.826,"That one is set to start in Q2, so I am assuming beginning of April it will kick off.",92,,
282,0.97,2762.826,2776.64,"It's going to be a fairly significant product, and it will probably take two to three auditors, and that's currently my entire audit team, and it will probably be a 3 to 4 month endeavor.",92,,
283,0.97,2776.64,2781.211,Anything to add to that in terms of time line?,93,,
284,0.97,2781.211,2787.818,"The discipline as mentioned kicking off Q2, taking probably through the remainder of the rest of the year.",94,,
285,0.97,2787.818,2791.021,It's a big project.,95,,
286,0.97,2791.021,2831.094,"But I am anticipating having staff to also undertake a look at supervision issues, and supervision was one of the major issues in the consent decree, and that was largely focused on first line patrol supervision, and I think what we would like to do is take that back a step, and take a look at command supervision, and look at the effectiveness of t consistency, and what communications is like, both up and down the chain of command, and it will be a different look at SPD's supervision than has gone on in the last 7 or 8 years.",95,,
287,0.97,2831.094,2851.882,"This also was identified in the recent retention and hiring report and recommendations that led to the funding of officers' training to the tune of about $780,000.",96,,
288,0.97,2851.882,2871.535,"And so I support that work because to the extent that we can support our sergeants who are supervising other officers, and that helps with the retention of officers, existing officers, and I think that's really important.",96,,
289,0.97,2871.535,2882.479,"I'm just wondering, will the supervision audit provide the Department with some data that it can use to actually measure the effectiveness of this training?",96,,
290,0.97,2882.479,2885.048,"Ideally, yes.",97,,
291,0.97,2885.048,2898.395,"All of these work products, our goal for them is to give something to the community that Educates the community and gives something to SPD to allow them to make system improvements.",97,,
292,0.97,2898.395,2919.449,"It's really about identifying issues and providing suggestions for potential ways they can improve, and so all of these things will hopefully involve concrete identification of root causes and systemic issues, and then recommendations for how they can be improved.",97,,
293,0.97,2919.449,2921.752,Similarly the retention audit?,97,,
294,0.97,2921.752,2965.228,"All are really intertwined in how the officers perceive their jobs, their role in the Department and community, whether they are satisfied with that, whether they want to stick around, promote how the communication work in the Department, and I'm hoping all of these three taken together will provide some Pathway to, perhaps, moral improvement, improved retention, and that will have impacts on hiring and stuff.",98,,
295,0.97,2965.228,3007.904,"And on the retention audit, I would request that you pay particular attention to one of the recommendations I saw that came out of the report I just mentioned, and that is related to officers' schedules, and I don't know if you're planning on doing exit interviews with officers, but I think getting more of a sense from officers on the difficulties that the current scheduling regime creates for them and how it leads to the loss of officers to other departments who have different approaches to scheduling, and I think that would be really useful as well.",99,,
296,0.97,3007.904,3017.08,"Yeah, I think work schedules are definitely a huge factor in officer satisfaction and moral and retention.",100,,
297,0.97,3017.08,3018.415,We will look at that certainly.,100,,
298,0.97,3018.415,3024.855,"There was a key point I was going to make, and it just went right out of my head.",100,,
299,0.97,3024.855,3026.656,"I might remember it, but I might not.",100,,
300,0.97,3026.656,3064.995,"Some of the other issues that are sitting there waiting for us to be able to devote some attention to are a follow up on the DNA destruction issue, and I think on the horizon is a look at the evidence section, and a larger context, and what tends to happen in a consent decree situation is all of the resources in the Department are very much focused on the needed changes mandated by the decree, and there's other systems critical within the police Department that are then not getting the attention that they perhaps need.",100,,
301,0.97,3064.995,3076.006,"Certainly taking a look at evidence, and chief best has asked us to look at issue identification within the force investigation team.",100,,
302,0.97,3076.006,3078.341,The chain of the command.,100,,
303,0.97,3078.341,3112.409,"There are times at perhaps there's a focus on the certain aspect of the investigation, and there may be other issues, professionalism or other significant violations of policy that go Unaddressed until they get to a certain stage, much later in the game, and we are going to take a look at communication and efficiency within all of those various ways that policy violations, misconduct is investigated, to make sure there's no gaps, and the last one, secure Firearm storage issue.",100,,
304,0.97,3112.409,3114.444,The last one coming to us from chief best.,100,,
305,0.97,3114.444,3127.557,"It was about a Firearm that went missing during a training exercise, and so we are looking at the training facility to make sure they have adequate storage for firearms there.",100,,
306,0.97,3127.557,3136.366,"All right, policy work, and this is the work that is near and dear to my heart.",100,,
307,0.97,3136.366,3139.369,I talked about the process of the appeals process.,100,,
308,0.97,3139.369,3159.456,"We are currently doing the same process, mapping uses of force, and so from the time force is used through investigation and review of that force, we want to have another process map so people understand, you know, how force is reviewed and investigated.",100,,
309,0.97,3159.456,3168.431,"Same with crisis intervention and human services, and there are a lot of other players in the system, in addition to SPD.",100,,
310,0.97,3168.431,3209.105,"We want to make sure we understand how interactions flow, who the stake holders are and what the obligations are of everyone in the circumstances, and also, we are going to take a look at force investigation team processes, and that's probably part of the larger use of force mapping process, and we are engaging in some pattern analysis for the annual report that is looking at Aggregated OPA numbers and providing some statistics for folks, and looking at complaints, claims, and lawsuits coming in as a result of APD actions, and we are hoping to have data and Informaion on those also.",100,,
311,0.97,3209.105,3215.779,I think that's going to be interesting work in our year end report.,100,,
312,0.97,3215.779,3239.502,"Amy, do you want to talk a little bit about the civilians' work that a little bit of an impediment because OPA has originally recently started hiring investigators.",100,,
313,0.97,3239.502,3246.409,There is not much we can do in terms of an actual analysis of.,100,,
314,0.97,3246.409,3264.494,Efficiency or effectiveness one between the other but as they Onboard their civilian staff will be able to do some comparative analysis when the interim we are doing some research on our own.,100,,
315,0.97,3264.494,3266.129,You want to describe that a little bit?,100,,
316,0.97,3266.129,3276.106,"First, additional background content, the material you over highlighted, all the oversight are civilian led.",101,,
317,0.97,3276.106,3281.344,One of the developments of the structure is what role can sworn officers like particularly when you are doing investigations of allegations of officer misconduct.,101,,
318,0.97,3281.344,3301.464,"One concern had been in a sworn officer fairly investigate a fellow sworn officer given those Dynamics for relationships, power structures and Whatnot and so the Council had us as part of the accountability legislation building a look at civilian versus sworn investigators and what kind of impact that has on trust, effectiveness, outcomes and that sort of thing.",101,,
319,0.97,3301.464,3317.18,"As Inspector General judge highlighted, it is a little challenging to figure out that dynamic and the data when those processes in the beginning stage of just now starting to hire some of those civilian investigators so I think that will impact the IG's look at that question.",101,,
320,0.97,3317.18,3343.64,"Can you remind us because I recall this as one of the areas where the contract approved by Spago and executive, and the Council differed from our 2017 accountability legislation as it relates specifically to the OPA directors authority to hire civilian investigators.",102,,
321,0.97,3343.64,3358.688,Can you remind us of what we passed in our original legislation versus what ultimately ended up in the contract?,102,,
322,0.97,3358.688,3359.989,"Your recollection is correct, Madam chair.",103,,
323,0.97,3359.989,3372.736,"The accountability legislation contemplated there would be a mix of civilian Unsworn in whatever configuration that made the most sense based on available data, best practice and so forth which is part of the impetus for having it studied.",103,,
324,0.97,3372.736,3388.618,"The police officers Guild contract identified there could be two civilian investigators so out of a complement of approximately 10 investigators, about 20% of them are in the process of being converted into a civilian position.",103,,
325,0.97,3388.618,3402.098,"There is also, on the management side, there has already been a migration of the supervisory level investigators to a civilian structure under the Seattle police management Association contract.",103,,
326,0.97,3402.098,3425.388,"One of the challenges that was highlighted by Inspector General judge and her bargaining recommendations was if the contract does specify a specific number, it does create difficulties for our office to evaluate what is the logical number that makes the most sense, how do you give the OPA director the discretion to identify what mix will produce the optimal outcome?",103,,
327,0.97,3425.388,3443.072,"And for sure, there have been benefits that everyone has seen from having sworn officers as part of that process.",103,,
328,0.97,3443.072,3482.245,"The inspector general herself has someone with extensive law enforcement experience on Stefan that is really invaluable in understanding the Dynamics of the individual cases, history and regular police practices but there is still the question of what is that optimum mix and what is happening so far is if you are having two civilian investigators, you are necessarily constraining the model to having if you think of organizational deployment, if you have 2 and 8 that is necessarily going to steer you in different directions on how you want to manage the Workflow and what categories or types of cases people might hear and so the original legislation contemplated a freer flowing model where that discretion rested with the OPA director.",103,,
329,0.97,3482.245,3482.846,Thank you.,104,,
330,0.97,3482.846,3490.386,"Just to wrap up, the Seattle police Department has a policy, audit policy and research section so we are in an ongoing relationship with them to provide technical assistance.",105,,
331,0.97,3490.386,3528.758,"Moving onto the next slide, this is just a slide that describes our work in OPA review so we reviewed decisions about how to classify incoming complaints, we review their completed investigations to ensure that they are thorough, Unbiased and timely and then we have also been in the process of doing our own internal analysis of our work to make sure that we have appropriate quality controls in place and appropriate criteria that is a stated and understood by all the parties about how we do those assessments of OPA.",105,,
332,0.97,3528.758,3538.501,We have some special projects underway that I think are really interesting and innovative and I am very excited about them.,105,,
333,0.97,3538.501,3545.008,The first one I would like to highlight is an effective interviewing project that we have ongoing.,105,,
334,0.97,3545.008,3553.116,This was initially identified as a priority project with my office and CCC.,105,,
335,0.97,3553.116,3614.477,"In that collaboration, an expert from the UK was identified who came out and has done some training and has been engaged by my office, SPD and OPA to create a training policy and an overall program for effective communication and this involves how you talk to, suspects, this victims, witnesses, everybody in a way that uses the best social science research we have now to understand how to effectively mind memory, not to Overwrite memory, how to engage Free- flowing information without introducing any undue coercion or things that might contribute to wrongful confessions or something so I think this is a really exciting topic and this would probably be one of the first comprehensive training and policy programs of this nature in the country.",105,,
336,0.97,3614.477,3614.677,Yes?,105,,
337,0.97,3614.677,3636.666,Do you know if that training includes anything specifically about how to notice or observe whether people have a disability or mental health issue or if there is a different way to talk to young people compared to--?,106,,
338,0.97,3636.666,3637.1,Absolutely.,107,,
339,0.97,3637.1,3665.862,I think effective medication has to take into account the person's capabilities and their situations so the great thing about this is this expert is working with SPD and the other Stakeholders to develop a training product and a program that is responsive to the needs of community here in Seattle so that is one of the things that we have talked about and will and sure those are part of policy and training.,107,,
340,0.97,3665.862,3678.808,And is it likely that this collaboration will include a review of current policy around the use of--and interviews?,108,,
341,0.97,3678.808,3679.442,Yes.,109,,
342,0.97,3679.442,3752.014,"So the next one is a program that was developed in New Orleans as a result of their involvement in a consent decree and just to boil it down, it is about providing officers with training and skills to be active by standards with each other so it is a way for officers to intervene when they see some the was one of their fellow officers, perhaps losing their temper or getting into a situation before unprofessional conduct happens before misconduct occurs so they can help each other and keep each other out of those kind of situations and it may seem intuitive that people would step in and intervene and help each other up at the science, social science indicates it is really the inverse of that that here is a natural Incli to not want to step in and intervene in situations that are going down a bad road so I think this would be a very helpful program for SPD to develop and implement and it was one of my first recommendations to achieve best about a year ago that year and a half ago, maybe.",109,,
343,0.97,3752.014,3791.821,"The last one is the program I mentioned earlier, council member Borelli's, the sentinel review process and that is about having a trained group of SPD Paul people involving people who have the requisite foundation of knowledge about police practices, constitutional law and the subject matter to come together and do a thorough review a sentinel event which is a bad outcome with an eye toward mitigating the likelihood that the outcome happens again.",109,,
344,0.97,3791.821,3807.27,"I would be happy to come and talk to if you would like to talk more about this, I would be happy to come and talk to you about it.",109,,
345,0.97,3807.27,3817.48,"Just to add, this is also a recommendation of the CPC in their September 2019 serious and Deady force investigation task force.",110,,
346,0.97,3817.48,3823.986,Yes they had a specific recommendation that we start our process with a review of the--officer involved shooting from New year's eve of 2018.,111,,
347,0.97,3823.986,3841.871,My own sense of getting one of these review processes started is I think that is perhaps too important an event for a community to have that be a test case.,111,,
348,0.97,3841.871,3862.525,I think we really need to do a pilot of something that is perhaps not as--I know it sounds Counterintuitive but I think it is not as immediate importance to the community so that we work out the bugs on something critical.,111,,
349,0.97,3862.525,3889.151,"All of these events are critical and have had significant negative impacts on community and families so I don't want to diminish any of those but I think starting with one that is, where the issues are little bit easier to identify to make sure that we have a good framework for the review process is important before we embark on the fellow Togo matter.",111,,
350,0.97,3889.151,3894.023,Is there a time when this issue in the selection of a particular incident to review?,112,,
351,0.97,3894.023,3904.367,Do you get to a point where too much time has gone by for it to be a meaningful engagement?,112,,
352,0.97,3904.367,3908.771,I think that is one of the critical aspects of the sentinel event review board is it has to be timely.,113,,
353,0.97,3908.771,3932.161,"If you are identifying critical systemic failures or ways in which the system needs to be improved, a year or two down the road you are doing it to service to everybody who has been operating in that system for that period of time and to team members impacted by that so in an ideal world, these need to happen in fairly short order.",113,,
354,0.97,3932.161,3933.629,The force investigation has to occur.,113,,
355,0.97,3933.629,3948.477,There has to be some investigation for the board to look at and to use as the framework for the review but it can't be so far down the road that it makes the impact of it less significant.,113,,
356,0.97,3948.477,3953.916,So can you talk a little bit about your Timeline for selecting a case?,114,,
357,0.97,3953.916,3954.917,-- for the sentinel review?,114,,
358,0.97,3954.917,3965.928,"Yes, we are hoping to pilot a sentinel event review process sometime in, probably toward the end of Q2 or Q3.",115,,
359,0.97,3965.928,3968.431,What is the approximate length of such a review?,116,,
360,0.97,3968.431,3972.601,I think it would depend on the complexity of the case.,117,,
361,0.97,3972.601,3998.627,I would like to start with one where a board could maybe meet a day or two and be able to really do a thorough review of it but those details are to be worked out with Stakeholders and we have to identify persons who would be good members of the board and contribute the things that all of us would like to see as part of that board.,117,,
362,0.97,3998.627,3999.228,All right.,118,,
363,0.97,3999.228,3999.628,Thank you.,118,,
364,0.97,3999.628,4000.563,Okay.,119,,
365,0.97,4000.563,4018.514,So you made a comment about Cbcs recommendations so these are just some of the issues that we wanted to highlight.,120,,
366,0.97,4018.514,4022.985,"Discipline and supervision, we have accepted the recommendations that we look at those issues and sentinel event review which was talked about.",120,,
367,0.97,4022.985,4039.001,Cbc has identified 9-1-1 center operations as an area for us to look at . With times and also with issues potentially of disparity so we are continuing to assess our ability to take that on and I think that is an important topic.,120,,
368,0.97,4039.001,4055.151,They have identified hate crimes but the city auditor has done some work on that and so we are trying not to cross over into their work too much.,120,,
369,0.97,4055.284,4060.956,"Disparity in police stops is an ongoing issue, a body of work with SPD and CPC so we are looking to continue that as his officer--Ness.",120,,
370,0.97,4060.956,4081.243,I remember I mentioned our Wrap- up report for 2019 but we will also do a joint midyear report with CPC sometime this summer to talk about our projects and our work together.,120,,
371,0.97,4081.243,4082.311,We talked about outreach.,121,,
372,0.97,4082.311,4088.083,"I think I have gone way over my time, I'm sure so if there's anything else you would like to talk about, I am happy to do that.",121,,
373,0.97,4088.083,4089.151,That is quite all right.,122,,
374,0.97,4089.151,4091.22,I had a lot of questions so appreciate your indulgence.,122,,
375,0.97,4091.22,4091.821,Absolutely.,123,,
376,0.97,4091.821,4094.857,Great report and looking forward to ongoing work with you in the coming year.,124,,

378,0.97,4095.658,4096.926,So I don't have a question.,126,,
379,0.97,4096.926,4112.942,"I just have a few quick comments and you know, part of the reason I don't have any questions is that the director and deputy director were kind enough to expend a considerable amount of time with me last week where we talked over the coming goals and work plan for the office and I just want to thank you very much for your professionalism.",126,,

476,0.97,4988.016,4989.718,We really see this Re- envisioning as offering 3 things.,151,,
477,0.97,4989.718,4995.957,"1 is that when you look at the past few decades of our work, not only is homelessness part of art from but so has education, early learning, immigrant, refugee affairs.",151,,
478,0.97,4995.957,5005.667,"Housing is in part of this and we say, we have involved so let's update who we are.",151,,
479,0.97,5005.667,5040.001,"The second thing is you often hear, what is the prevention upstream work that it the city is doing in regards to homelessness and we have always connected the homeless men homelessness but we see our work is that so how do we do become investing smartly so we don't send people into the homeless system and third is how do we, the entire process of revision, how do we make it so it is so inclusive not only for community and employees but owned by them so it is part of that, we will be going directly to service recipients, providers, our own employees to craft what our values are closer in our work and not coming from leadership per se.",151,,
480,0.97,5040.001,5041.202,Thank you.,152,,
481,0.97,5041.202,5046.608,"So moving through our other results, first, I just want to acknowledge our overall stewardship role.",153,,

483,0.97,5063.558,5076.538,"We are always working to identify and reduce administrative burden especially to our customer, the service providers.",153,,
484,0.97,5076.538,5095.023,"For preparing you for for success in 2020, this will continue to be an effort where we support the Seattle youth program, a program that helps young people gain important career skills and provides them an opportunity to earn and save money.",153,,
485,0.97,5095.023,5105.233,This program serves 400 participants in the summer and 200 participants in the fall.,153,,
486,0.97,5105.233,5141.002,"The youth and family empowerment division or Y Fe funds our best which helps to improve the life outcomes for young black men and boys, Yfe partners with other departments and community organizations to end violence for young people both under 18 as well as over 18 and we do that in partnership with a series of investments we refer to as youth development which will be Rfp this year.",153,,
487,0.97,5141.002,5142.203,Can I ask a question?,154,,
488,0.97,5142.203,5142.604,Absolutely.,155,,
489,0.97,5142.604,5155.884,I am interested in the Seattle youth employment program . You just stated that 400 folks take advantage of it in the summer and 200 and the fall.,156,,
490,0.97,5155.884,5183.711,It looks like from looking at her Online it is kind of like--it seems to be structured as like a year-long plan with like a Fall/Winter and spring Module and a summer Internship so are there--the expectation on the Website Sems to be setting up that everyone kind of sign up for the whole hall but do some people do the modules and maybe not the Internship or do some people get Grandfathered in for the Internship and not to the modules?,156,,
491,0.97,5183.711,5191.119,How does that work if it kind of starts with--?,156,,
492,0.97,5191.119,5191.553,--,157,,
493,0.97,5191.553,5192.153,Thank you.,158,,
494,0.97,5192.153,5193.154,I will provide an overview.,158,,
495,0.97,5193.154,5215.276,"So we actually expanded the program and so in recent years it was summer only and in fact, some of the--offices held Seattle Yuth employment in terms during the summer so that is my pitch to you.",159,,
496,0.97,5215.276,5237.332,"But we expended it because we know that we want to build Competencies over a period of time and so that is where, in the fall, we have an opportunity where young people can essentially learn and earn with us so they will participate in weekly activities to build Competencies, be exposed to feature career opportunities, and relationships with each other, all of those important things around youth development so that way they can transition successfully into the summer program.",159,,
497,0.97,5237.332,5249.611,"Because we are phasing it in, we have 200 young people starting with us and increasing it to 400 so we are actually releasing an application.",159,,
498,0.97,5249.611,5250.912,I don't have the exact date.,159,,
499,0.97,5250.912,5254.716,I was hoping to have it but it will be next week so I will follow up with you.,159,,
500,0.97,5254.716,5261.422,We are having some technical difficulties but we will open it up for young people in the Seattle area to apply and so that is where we will fill the 400.,159,,
501,0.97,5261.422,5283.745,"However, for those young people who work with us during the school year time, as long as they have met their performance measures, they will be automatically placed in the youth employment program but we will open it up so we can fill those other spots and as we transition to the fall we will work on that again.",159,,
502,0.97,5283.745,5294.122,"Jason mentioned we have our youth employment--excuse me, youth development Rfp coming up, too so we will work with community providers to be another throughput enough to were summer program but we need to and align it to the years of phasing it in fully.",159,,
503,0.97,5294.122,5313.641,"I am happy to come back and give you a more thorough presentation because it is a lot of layers and different pieces but we are accepting employers so if you would like to host a young person, I'm happy to follow up with that, too.",159,,
504,0.97,5313.641,5315.243,Mccue anticipated one of my other question.,159,,
505,0.97,5315.243,5320.581,I have a question about who are the other employers and what is the process for them to get young people into their place of employment?,160,,
506,0.97,5320.581,5329.691,We have an application process for that as well so we work with a lot of city departments as well as our Community-Based organizations.,161,,
507,0.97,5329.691,5363.391,"It is a 6 week opportunity and because we are working with, you know, ""Underserved populations"" it is an opportunity to give exposure to have meaningful experiences within a short period of time.",161,,
508,0.97,5363.391,5371.532,"It is not really meant to be a workforce development program where we kind of fill positions for you to operate fully during the summer and so if that is for you, it is definitely something we are looking for.",161,,
509,0.97,5371.532,5375.837,"A lot of our city departments as well as communities and providers have a lot of returning organizations like Swedish, etc.",161,,
510,0.97,5375.837,5376.804,We have had high success.,161,,
511,0.97,5376.804,5377.839,One more final question.,162,,
512,0.97,5377.839,5391.052,If you will explain the eligibility to 30 so I can apply as well--it sounds like a great program and I wish it actually had existed when I was kind of at this point in high school and I am looking to get more engaged with a Cohort like this but are private employers engaged as well potentially as an opportunity for placements?,162,,
513,0.97,5391.052,5402.563,I know of some that would potentially be interested if they aren't currently to engage in something like this to provide Entry-Level Internship opportunities.,162,,
514,0.97,5402.563,5408.536,I am just curious.,162,,
515,0.97,5408.536,5409.57,"Well, you're not eligible.",163,,
516,0.97,5409.57,5410.171,I am sorry.,163,,
517,0.97,5410.171,5411.139,"Yeah, well, you know.",164,,
518,0.97,5411.139,5423.651,I will say what I love about the city is it is not just about the Seattle youth employment program.,165,,
519,0.97,5423.651,5463.09,"You probably have heard about other programs like opportunity promise which is supporting Internships for our Seattle promise young people and I can't speak to that because it is not being administered by our Department but we work closely and Realign and I know that our Cohort is working with a lot of private sector employers--the real differences we are subsidizing our wages and so young people who are eligible, we pay for their wages, provide Wraparound supports, everything from your Ortho passed away food Stipend to make sure you are set up to succeed.",165,,
520,0.97,5463.09,5485.646,"In terms of private employers ready to have their first intern we want to encourage where they could, if they are offering that to consider hiring our community college students and so that is a plug for opportunity promise so there is a need, there is a Pathway, a clear Pathway and so I would say that we can plug into that but I want to make sure that you get to the right program.",165,,
521,0.97,5485.646,5486.447,"Great, thank you.",166,,
522,0.97,5486.447,5487.315,One more question.,167,,
523,0.97,5487.315,5490.651,So this chart indicates investments in youth development and investments in reducing youth violence.,167,,
524,0.97,5490.651,5496.424,Can you talk about what those two things are?,167,,
525,0.97,5496.424,5505.399,"Yes, we have a mix of our portfolio so along with our direct services we discussed we have investments through contracts.",167,,
526,0.97,5505.399,5515.877,We have a preemployment and youth development request for proposal traditionally.,167,,
527,0.97,5515.877,5537.064,"This year we are Aligning it because we believe if you are working with youth and young adults, they should do youth development and clear readiness at the same time so that is going to be released in the spring and so I just Previewed without giving anything away, I Previewed the capital Rfp guidelines and it is pretty magnificent if I may say so that is coming up very shortly.",167,,
528,0.97,5537.064,5553.414,"Those investments are things like you can imagine, connecting young people to their cultural identity, working in teams to be involved in a community, leadership opportunity, etc.",167,,
529,0.97,5553.414,5555.983,There will be more detail in the Rfp but that is a preview.,167,,
530,0.97,5555.983,5578.506,"For the youth violence reduction, we do have a focus on young adults 18 to 24 but we actually serve a spectrum of ages so we certainly work with minors as well as all ages up and it is really around working with individuals who have been impacted by the criminal legal system and the Rfp went out last year.",167,,
531,0.97,5578.506,5605.466,"We started our contracts just last month in January and we have an amazing Cohort of 14 Community-Based organizations who are tackling violence and in the criminal legal system itself but we are working, as you know, it is top of mind for a lot of people and so that is a priority for us to look at our investments and where there are some potential gaps and where might we continue to support safety in the community.",167,,
532,0.97,5605.466,5662.823,"As it relates to that specifically in our last committee meeting, we did a quick overview of--led by central staff of where the human services Department was in allocating counsel budget ads and there is, as you know, about $522,000 in counsel budget adds focused on your diversion, community building education programs and as of the memo that we received on 24 January, the status we received from H SD as captured by the central staff is that the allocation of these funds was part of an ongoing discussion.",168,,
533,0.97,5662.823,5666.627,Hsd is meeting with the organizations to get a better understanding of programming to determine best contracting options.,168,,
534,0.97,5666.627,5677.438,The point of this exercise was to recognize that some of that counsel funding was for existing programs and so could just be rolled into an existing contract.,168,,
535,0.97,5677.438,5693.254,Some are for existing services but would require a new Rfp and some are for brand-new programs that have to be developed.,168,,
536,0.97,5693.254,5696.524,The new programs that have to be developed will probably take the most amount of time.,168,,
537,0.97,5696.524,5717.578,The things that are for existing services but still need an Rfp Midrange amount of time to get those dollars out the door but that the existing contract should be the quickest and I think the information that we received from Hsd largely Comports with that expectation but just wanting a little more detail on where we are at with the diversion funds that you are identifying as a new contract.,168,,
538,0.97,5717.578,5731.258,"But not a new program development, is that correct?",168,,
539,0.97,5731.258,5731.659,Yes.,169,,
540,0.97,5731.659,5748.509,That one was complicated because there were ongoing funds that were introduced as well as one-time funds so we are reconciling the two Cbas that were awarded and so we have been working on it as recently as yesterday.,169,,
541,0.97,5748.509,5771.432,"You are right that there are some agencies we would just make a contract amendment but in addition to that, there was a multiple strategy outlined in in there or activities outlined in there and we are trying to Finesse it with how much identify how we identify how much money is needed for each project area so I do believe within a couple of months we should be able to contract those out.",169,,
542,0.97,5771.432,5775.336,We are mindful people want the funds knowing we want to get the resources out so we are very close.,169,,
543,0.97,5775.336,5776.77,We are having conversations with those providers.,169,,
544,0.97,5776.77,5787.915,One of them I might just quickly mention is that Ringer Beach and beautiful safe place for youth and so that is is Partnering with the lead organization and really it is doing the budget development and contracting so it could be amendment which is more straightforward.,169,,
545,0.97,5787.915,5802.93,So some of the funds will potentially just be awarded via the amendment more quickly and some may take more time?,170,,
546,0.97,5802.93,5803.364,Yes.,171,,
547,0.97,5803.364,5828.789,One of the reasons that was given during the budget process for the urgency of these funds is because there was recognition that the Council had allocated another pot of funds and those dollars are going to be awarded by the office of civil rights for very similar kind of work but it was going to be a community led grant making process and so it was in $1.3 million.,172,,
548,0.97,5828.789,5830.09,That process is ongoing.,172,,
549,0.97,5830.09,5854.548,"It is, the process itself is taking a little more time but is basically aligned with what the Council's expectations were in 2018 when we voted for the funds to be allocated in 2020 but the idea between--behind these funds is we want to get these out the door right away so I just want to highlight that.",172,,
550,0.97,5854.548,5876.704,"You mentioned that there is a sense of urgency but I also want to make sure that there is some coordination with the work that is being done over in s OCR, the office of civil rights and the decisions they are making for a similar body of work with similar desired outcomes and a lot of the same community partners.",172,,
551,0.97,5876.704,5882.343,Thank you.,173,,
552,0.97,5882.343,5902.463,"Okay before leaving preparing you for success, I want to highlight their, important work around addressing hunger so it is healthy food access in out of school programs that is critically important and will continue to be a priority area for the Department this year.",174,,
553,0.97,5902.463,5935.429,"Likewise, the efforts to reduce sugary beverage consumption and advance health equity will continue . The human services Department administers roughly $5 million of that fund . food access and mail deliveries also takes place in Yfe but also in our aging and disability services division and is critically important to helping to make Seattle more affordable.",174,,
554,0.97,5935.429,5954.281,"Likewise, we have and administer inside the human services Department the utility discount program and that is a program that is currently supporting a little more than 34,000 households across the utility service area.",174,,
555,0.97,5954.281,5965.693,We will continue to support those households but also continue and shoring that other qualified households across the region know about the program and how to access it.,174,,
556,0.97,5965.693,5999.46,"I would--on this track related to expanding U Dp to a larger proportion of likely eligible households, we understand that the--universe of eligible households is around 98% of the Buddhist 98,000 households . We are currently serving about 35,000.",175,,
557,0.97,5999.46,6013.974,I would be very interested in--to know from you more information about what it will take and what kind of support the Council can offer to expand access to this really vital home saving program.,175,,
558,0.97,6013.974,6014.274,Great.,176,,
559,0.97,6014.274,6018.479,I look forward to that.,176,,
560,0.97,6018.479,6019.279,So promote healthy aging.,176,,
561,0.97,6019.279,6039.466,"This year, we will continue all of the great work inside of the area agency on aging plan . This is a plan that helps us to maximize independence for thousands of vulnerable older adults and adults with disabilities living in their homes.",176,,
562,0.97,6039.466,6046.573,We also want to explore and hopefully increase our partnership with King County.,176,,
563,0.97,6046.573,6059.319,"King County has a veterans, seniors and human services levy and is supporting some really important work for seniors through that fund source.",176,,
564,0.97,6059.319,6068.028,We want to make sure that we are aligned and that we can build on a joint effort there.,176,,
565,0.97,6068.028,6080.04,"Community living connections, this is an effort that supports nearly 40,000 clients to ensure that they are connected to the services that they need.",176,,
566,0.97,6080.04,6092.219,"Likewise, we will be implementing the age friendly action the what a sorry, Seattle's age friendly action plan.",176,,
567,0.97,6092.219,6105.099,This is a multiple Department and Stakeholder effort to ensure that Seattle is built for and supports an aging population but with that lens and supports all of us and makes life easier for anyone at any age and we want to make sure that that effort is expended.,176,,
568,0.97,6105.099,6118.979,"I'm sorry, some of these things are new to me.",177,,
569,0.97,6118.979,6122.049,And I get a little more information on what the area on aging plan is?,177,,
570,0.97,6122.049,6122.483,Sure.,178,,
571,0.97,6122.483,6122.816,Kathy?,178,,
572,0.97,6122.816,6135.395,"So it is about a 45 year relationship that we have had with the Federal Government through the older Americans Act and that mandates area agencies on aging, we have that designation within the city in partnership with the county.",179,,
573,0.97,6135.395,6142.603,"Part of our requirement is every 4 years we developed an area agency plan, it is sort of a map to help us.",179,,
574,0.97,6142.603,6146.473,We go through a process of identifying needs and this is Countywide because we serve the entire County.,179,,
575,0.97,6146.473,6157.017,So it is a great way for us to sort of stay focused on the future and making sure we are trying to address the needs of older adults.,179,,
576,0.97,6157.017,6168.962,But that doesn't tell me anything about what specifically you are doing.,179,,
577,0.97,6171.298,6171.832,Is that service?,179,,
578,0.97,6171.832,6172.633,In the plan?,180,,
579,0.97,6172.633,6173.5,Is it housing?,181,,
580,0.97,6173.5,6174.434,We don't do housing.,182,,
581,0.97,6174.434,6176.103,"Is a transit, Healthcare, what is it?",183,,
582,0.97,6176.103,6177.704,It is considered mostly supportive services.,184,,
583,0.97,6177.704,6191.151,"The older Americans act was really that program that looked at how you help people stay at home who need maybe access to meals, transportation, all of those supportive services.",184,,
584,0.97,6191.151,6191.952,We don't fund housing.,184,,
585,0.97,6191.952,6198.058,"We don't, we have some transportation services but they are fairly limited and we, as Jason said, we work in partnership with other Epartments to try to meet those needs.",184,,
586,0.97,6198.058,6200.661,How often is--what period of time does the plan cover?,185,,
587,0.97,6200.661,6203.63,We just submitted our 4 your plan for 2020 through 2023.,186,,
588,0.97,6203.63,6208.435,"So--and many of the services, it is a continuation.",186,,
589,0.97,6208.435,6219.846,There has been some--the older Americans act identifies priorities for services.,186,,
590,0.97,6219.846,6223.984,We have some flexibility but we also have--nutrition has always been a very important part of the program.,186,,
591,0.97,6223.984,6240.167,"Community living connections, 40 years ago we called it senior information and assistance but now it is called double disc it has kind of progress to where we look at broader needs.",186,,
592,0.97,6240.167,6242.869,It is great because this is a strong partnership with our community providers.,186,,
593,0.97,6242.869,6249.209,People want to go to a trusted source for information so they are going to look to those agencies in the community that they feel they can get the information they need.,186,,
594,0.97,6249.209,6251.712,I think I heard you say you just Submittedthe plan?,187,,
595,0.97,6251.712,6252.279,Is that right?,187,,
596,0.97,6252.279,6252.879,In October.,188,,
597,0.97,6252.879,6257.517,"Right so it will have to be approved, is that correct?",189,,
598,0.97,6257.517,6258.785,It is approved by the state.,189,,
599,0.97,6258.785,6262.689,The state has the responsibility for doing that and then so that is how we access our Federal funds.,189,,
600,0.97,6262.689,6264.224,Is through the approval of that plan.,189,,
601,0.97,6264.224,6278.572,"Mccann the elements of the plan are, to do--to some extent asked defined by the requirements of the Federal Government?",189,,
602,0.97,6278.572,6279.239,Yes.,190,,
603,0.97,6279.239,6280.641,But you do have some flexibility?,191,,
604,0.97,6280.641,6285.145,We do have some flexibility because the whole focus of area agencies on aging were you know what your local needs are.,192,,
605,0.97,6285.145,6287.948,Hours are different here than in Spokane so we do have some flexibility.,192,,
606,0.97,6287.948,6300.127,"One of the things I hear a lot from folks is a feeling, through experience, that we need to be doing more around employment as it relates to our aging population.",193,,
607,0.97,6300.127,6311.338,"People are having to work longer before they are able to retire and I'm wondering, is this an area that this particular plan covers?",193,,
608,0.97,6311.338,6318.845,Ageism is a big problem and we focus more on that through our action plan for the age friendly initiative.,194,,
609,0.97,6318.845,6333.694,That is where we have a stronger focus their . We are working with other departments on that.,194,,
610,0.97,6333.694,6335.095,That is a big priority for me.,194,,
611,0.97,6335.095,6336.963,I hope with the Mayor we can really --,194,,
612,0.97,6336.963,6338.532,-- you can have a conversation.,195,,
613,0.97,6338.532,6338.832,Thank you.,195,,
614,0.97,6338.832,6348.909,"I just want to underscore that while our Department mostly served the city of Seattle, this division does have jurisdiction over the entire county so our case managers, we have some and Renton that serve all of King County and go into people's homes, not just in the city.",196,,
615,0.97,6348.909,6366.026,Good and I just want to make sure to capitalize on the opportunity to come back and talk more about both the area plan as well as the age friendly plan . I think there is a lot of opportunity in both of those for champions to help us move that work forward.,197,,
616,0.97,6366.026,6371.998,We stand ready to come back and dive deeply into that effort.,197,,
617,0.97,6371.998,6379.773,So our efforts to respond to Gender-Based violence.,197,,
618,0.97,6379.773,6389.75,"We have an investment portfolio that goes to Community-Based organizations, totaling nearly $11 million.",197,,

620,0.97,6391.651,6394.654,This is the first of its kind in this area.,197,,
621,0.97,6394.654,6417.811,"We are also trying to continue efforts, really strong efforts by the Mayor's office on domestic violence and sexual assault to increase awareness so there will be a creative art expert ambition in city hall during sexual assault Hormuz month that will get the awareness month that will get a lot of attention.",197,,
622,0.97,6417.811,6419.846,Promoting public health so we continue to hold that contract.,197,,
623,0.97,6419.846,6433.46,"We want to ensure that those investments, especially those that address gun violence and reduce Opioid use in communities across Seattle in the region are being supported in the right way.",197,,
624,0.97,6433.46,6468.628,"Finally, our efforts to respond to homelessness, again, we can talk in more detail about those but those are really centered on successfully standing up the King County regional homelessness authority that begins with a Co-Location period but also some of the important factors such as finding a Ceo, seeding and supporting a Governance structure, developing the staff plan and really being in a position to launch that authority in 2021 successfully.",197,,
625,0.97,6468.628,6479.906,We will continue to administer this cities navigation team and we will continue to coordinate with you and the Mayor's office to provide critical data updates and milestones related to our partnership and Stakeholders.,197,,
626,0.97,6479.906,6495.155,"Back on promoting public health, I just want to go back again to our previous committee meeting and document I Referenced earlier, giving the status update on counsel ads.",198,,
627,0.97,6495.155,6498.458,There are two items that I believe fit in the public health area.,198,,
628,0.97,6498.458,6521.982,"One is adding 55,000 dollars in one-time funds for educational programs targeted to the African-American--on HIV, aids and chronic disease and the ever the other is $145,000 for--workers and drug users.",198,,
629,0.97,6521.982,6534.394,"We were told for the former there would be a contract enacted by January 31 and for the letter, by Deborah 29, just checking in and making sure that that has happened.",198,,
630,0.97,6534.394,6539.699,I can address the second add.,199,,
631,0.97,6539.699,6558.184,It is held by our office and we are working in collaboration with public health right now to draft that contract . The contract will be the first contract of its kind for the green light project so we are in contract negotiation right now.,199,,
632,0.97,6558.184,6561.421,Thank you and for the one that was supposed to be enacted by the 31st?,200,,
633,0.97,6561.421,6570.497,That is a similar amendment to the public health contract and I would expect it is on target.,201,,
634,0.97,6570.497,6570.931,"Okay, great.",202,,
635,0.97,6570.931,6571.798,So thank you.,203,,
636,0.97,6571.798,6574.701,That is the human services Department of the work we have ahead in 2020.,203,,
637,0.97,6574.701,6581.441,I appreciate having the time to run through that update with you and that concludes my--report.,203,,
638,0.97,6581.441,6586.079,Do you have any further question?,204,,
639,0.97,6586.079,6587.414,I don't know if my college do.,204,,
640,0.97,6587.414,6612.572,I understand that the negotiations as it relates to the Council's added funding for the lead program is going through the Mayor's office so I'm not here to speak about the status of those negotiations but I am interested to know where this FALLS in your focus areas?,204,,
641,0.97,6612.572,6613.64,"Where, where does it fit?",204,,
642,0.97,6613.64,6628.855,"Right now, and throughout 2020, the lead contract will be held by the an hsa and so the homeless strategy investment division historically has managed that contract and will continue to do so this year.",205,,
643,0.97,6628.855,6647.507,"In 2021, and beyond, we are working in partnership right now with the Yfe division and trying to cross training with contract specialist so they can learn from the expertise of their current contract holder in HSI.",205,,
644,0.97,6647.507,6657.317,We will be working on Transitioning that contract but throughout 2020 that will be held by the agent division.,205,,
645,0.97,6657.317,6668.328,"I am looking to my colleague, council member Morales because she has made this point as well as I have as far as this Committee and our communications.",206,,
646,0.97,6668.328,6684.477,I want to flag that I think the fact that this contract is held in HSI might be sort of a Foundational issue for why we are having some problems because this is not a homelessness program.,206,,
647,0.97,6684.477,6710.336,"It is a public safety program so I am glad that you are looking at other alternatives but I do want to, again, flag that I think some of the difficulties we are having with negotiating this new contract might stem from the viewing of this as a homelessness program.",206,,
648,0.97,6710.336,6718.044,I do recognize that it was a previous counsel a few years ago that worked --,206,,
649,0.97,6718.044,6718.645,--,207,,
650,0.97,6718.645,6722.882,To lead the human services Department.,208,,
651,0.97,6722.882,6728.455,"But, you know, this is a process of continuous--improvement and we will all --",208,,
652,0.97,6728.455,6741.701,Thank you and we have moved many of our investments historically held by the division out into other divisions.,209,,
653,0.97,6741.701,6744.27,I think a clear example of that is all of our food contracts.,209,,
654,0.97,6744.27,6765.592,"Those used to be part of that larger homeless portfolio but really, once housing status was not a requirement for Accessing food so he made that transition so we continued that improvement process to make sure the investment portfolios we hold align within our current structure.",209,,
655,0.97,6765.592,6775.135,"I will also flag just the importance of our Re- envisioning effort . really, paying attention to what results were after, how we are organized, to achieve those results is critical.",209,,
656,0.97,6775.135,6776.336,We are doing that work now.,209,,
657,0.97,6776.336,6790.95,So the way that we may envision a contract likely being supported in the human services Department now might look different by the end of the year so I think that is why it is really important for us to stay in close communication about what that effort looks like.,209,,
658,0.97,6790.95,6797.891,That is a good--importance of that Re-Envisioning process you are engaged with so thank you.,210,,
659,0.97,6797.891,6800.126,Any other thoughts or questions?,210,,
660,0.97,6800.126,6813.139,Just really want to thank you all for the work that you do on behalf of the residents of our city that are greatly in need of your work and your commitment and your services.,210,,
661,0.97,6813.139,6820.68,It is really Life-Saving work so thank you all and I look forward to working with you all.,210,,

663,0.97,6821.681,6822.916,It take care.,211,,
664,0.97,6822.916,6824.117,Met with that there is no other further business.,211,,
665,0.97,6824.117,6829.422,"If there is no other further business, we are adjourned.",211,,
666,0.97,6829.422,6830.19,It is 11:30 A.M.,211,,
