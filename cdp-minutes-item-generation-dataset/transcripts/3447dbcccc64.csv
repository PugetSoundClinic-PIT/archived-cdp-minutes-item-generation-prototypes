82,0.97,370.937,396.696,"I'm afraid there's an additional issue I need to bring up after what happened this morning in my neighborhood, but first, is the city council investing in creating laws to Incentivize banks to create 21st century housing and commercial buildings for real economic development?",21,,

173,0.97,1003.702,1016.815,"As a baseline for the discussion, we know that even prior to Covid, the Covid-19 pandemic, the cost of ongoing general fund services have been growing and outpacing revenue growth.",33,,
174,0.97,1016.815,1029.795,"Without the action by this Council in 2020 to pass the Jumpstart funding bill and provide new sources of Progressive revenue, you would be looking a the a cuts budget, reducing services in the communities.",33,,
175,0.97,1029.795,1043.142,"In this 2022 proposed budget document, the Mayor has proposed to apply the new revenues, first preserve the set of existing programs, to stave off the cuts and underwrite a significant increase in new programs.",33,,
176,0.97,1043.142,1063.729,"Some of those programs are shared priorities with the Council, and while you all spent the next couple of weeks debating the merits and scale of the proposed investments, I want to underscore we know it's possible to fund everything in the proposed budget this year, and we also know there is not sustainable funding sources for all the priorities in the future years.",33,,
177,0.97,1063.729,1075.04,"So as you head into discussion, there's a couple of policy questions I would like to tee up for you that you will be asked in your deliberation of the budget.",33,,
178,0.97,1075.04,1076.608,"The first, we will begin tackling today.",33,,
179,0.97,1076.608,1080.446,Do you agree with the way the Jumpstart fund priorities have been met?,33,,
180,0.97,1080.446,1085.184,Do you understand and agree with the role Jumpstart is playing in the general fund?,33,,
181,0.97,1085.184,1095.461,Do you agree with the way the executive has proposed to meet jump start fund priorities across the variety of funding sources?,33,,
182,0.97,1095.461,1100.032,"The second policy question, how sustainable should the 2022 budget be?",33,,
183,0.97,1100.032,1110.909,"You will tackle this in choices about Replenishing reserves, how much new ongoing fund spending to authorize and how to support the increasing cost of programs.",33,,
184,0.97,1110.909,1115.647,Your decisions will be informed by your take on the context of the moment O 2022.,33,,
185,0.97,1115.647,1122.621,What are the community conditions a in the point in the pandemic and the economic response?,33,,
186,0.97,1122.621,1127.659,And what does that mean for ongoing spending and long-term Sustainability?,33,,
187,0.97,1127.659,1137.803,"Finally the third policy question is, do the new programs proposed in the budget add up to a coherent policy strategy to address this moment?",33,,
188,0.97,1137.803,1150.215,"We will tackle these questions throughout the week in Department and Cross-Cutting issue papers, particularly on issues like homelessness, human services, and Community-Led investments.",33,,
189,0.97,1150.215,1159.658,"Alternatives to policing and the criminal legal system, and the transportation and infrastructure to name a few.",33,,
190,0.97,1159.658,1164.73,Are resources aligned behind the strategy so it has a chance of being successful?,33,,
191,0.97,1164.73,1171.47,And where in these departments or proposals is there not yet a clear strategy?,33,,
192,0.97,1171.47,1175.474,"In those places, are there opportunities to slow down, pause, or scale back?",33,,
193,0.97,1175.474,1180.078,I look forward to diving into the policy questions with you over the next three days.,33,,
194,0.97,1180.078,1191.356,"Next I will hand it to my colleague, Aly Pennucci, central staff policy and budget manager to share a few more details about the issue identification process.",33,,
195,0.97,1191.356,1194.993,"Thank you, director handy, good morning chair and Councilmember.",34,,
196,0.97,1194.993,1196.495,I'm Aly Pennucci of Council central staff.,34,,
197,0.97,1196.495,1201.4,I'm happy to be here today to kick off issue identification discussions.,34,,
198,0.97,1201.4,1209.608,"Today we are on step two in the budget process, and step two of six.",34,,
199,0.97,1209.608,1235.567,"And just reiterate some of what the director and chair talked about, these discussions are an opportunity for Councilmembers to ask questions about the proposed budget, provide direction to staff about the options identified through the analysis, and over the next three days, this will be an opportunity for all of us to better understand your priorities and interests as we prepare the budget amendments and work with the chair and all of you to put together the Council's budget.",34,,
200,0.97,1235.567,1239.805,This slide outlines the departments and topics covered over the next throw days.,34,,
201,0.97,1239.805,1273.605,"As director handy noted, the budget is a large document, and these discussions will not cover every detail in the proposed budget, but it reflects the tremendous amount of work by our central staff analysts to unpack the budget with numerous technical documents to identify key issues, and I just want to take a moment to really thank all of the central staff team for their work to unpack this document to work with Councilmembers and their teams to consider options for consideration.",34,,
202,0.97,1273.605,1290.188,"As a reminder, as we sort through all of this, you know, the executive has been working for eight months to develop the proposed budget, and we have all had just over two weeks to review and Digest the document to review for your decisions.",34,,
203,0.97,1290.188,1298.797,"It's an impressive body of work, and we look forward to those discussions.",34,,
204,0.97,1298.797,1304.002,This is the plan for the rest of the week.,34,,
205,0.97,1304.002,1308.14,"Following discussions, quickly on the heels, issue I.D.",34,,
206,0.97,1308.14,1308.607,Discussions.,34,,
207,0.97,1308.607,1311.843,"Excuse me, discussion of the proposed Councilmember amendments.",34,,
208,0.97,1311.843,1330.796,"It will be discussed in committee the 26th through the 28th . reminder for everyone, any item, change, cut, statement of legislative intent, any idea you want considered needs to have a budget amendment request submitted to central staff.",34,,
209,0.97,1330.796,1339.805,"The deadline is Monday, October 18th at noon, and it must immediate all requirements, and feel free to contact we Offline if you have any questions about that process.",34,,
210,0.97,1341.073,1348.246,"So with that, I think we are ready to jump into the discussions unless Councilmembers have questions about the process.",34,,
211,0.97,1348.246,1352.417,"Thank you very much, Dr.",35,,
212,0.97,1352.417,1356.788,"Handy, thank you very much, Aly for the work you have done.",35,,
213,0.97,1356.788,1361.96,Extending our thanks to the central staff for providing the information over the next three days.,35,,
214,0.97,1361.96,1365.497,"I will note for colleagues, this is our chance to hear information.",35,,
215,0.97,1365.497,1369.534,Maybe there's issues surfaced for the first time that you were not aware of yet.,35,,
216,0.97,1369.534,1377.275,"The initial review of the budget proposed by the Mayor, you don't have to feel like all of the issues have to be verbally expressed here today.",35,,
217,0.97,1377.275,1387.252,"You may sit with the information over the next two or three days, and perhaps over the weekend as well, and you will realize, Hey, that's an issue I would like to see addressed.",35,,
218,0.97,1387.252,1396.628,"I have an amendment to help tackle the issue, to maybe bring the programs to scale or add the items back that you saw as reduced or cut.",35,,
219,0.97,1396.628,1404.102,"It's the chance to hear the items, and if you don't get the chance to talk about something on your priority list, that's okay.",35,,
220,0.97,1404.102,1409.808,It may come to you before the deadline of noon on Monday.,35,,
221,0.97,1409.808,1428.894,"We do hope that it has been clearly communicated, all of the amendments need to be submitted by noon on Monday, and that helps me as the budget chair along with central staff to be able to identify all of the issues for our consideration as we craft the budget proposal for consideration.",35,,
222,0.97,1428.894,1433.598,Every item in the budget will have an associated city budget amendment to go with it.,35,,
223,0.97,1433.598,1464.696,"Those do need to be submitted by noon on Monday, but it's also an opportunity over the next three days to sit and listen and share ideas and really have die League, but no pressure if you have an idea that comes to you late on Thursday or Friday and you didn't get a chance to bring it up, you can put forth the budget amendment to address the issues, and we look forward to the explicit discussion when we have those discussions as Aly noted, starting on October 26th, 27th, and 28th.",35,,
224,0.97,1469.0,1474.639,Okay.,36,,
225,0.97,1474.639,1475.64,Any additional questions?,36,,
226,0.97,1475.64,1478.543,"Thank you for the overview director handy, and Aly Pennucci.",36,,
227,0.97,1478.543,1479.878,It's great to see you again.,36,,
228,0.97,1479.878,1488.687,"To move us to the official portion of the presentation, we will read item number two to the record.",36,,
229,0.97,1488.687,1492.891,Madam clerk?,36,,
230,0.97,1492.891,1503.335,Item two for the record?,36,,
231,0.97,1506.738,1509.808,"Madame clerk, you may be on mute.",36,,
232,0.97,1509.808,1510.809,"Apologies, Councilmember.",37,,
233,0.97,1510.809,1511.343,No problem.,38,,
234,0.97,1511.343,1514.579,Am I reading number two?,39,,
235,0.97,1514.579,1514.846,Yes.,40,,
236,0.97,1514.846,1519.751,Overview of the 2022 proposed budget.,41,,
237,0.97,1519.751,1520.051,Apologies.,41,,
238,0.97,1520.051,1523.822,"Thank you very much, Madame clerk, and welcome back, Aly.",42,,
239,0.97,1523.822,1524.222,Thank you.,43,,
240,0.97,1524.222,1528.36,"The first discussion, the first paper is brief.",43,,
241,0.97,1528.36,1532.53,I will be providing a reader's guide for the information found in this paper.,43,,
242,0.97,1532.53,1540.071,The overview of the 2022 proposed budget is a resource for Councilmembers and the public providing a concise overview.,43,,
243,0.97,1540.071,1543.742,It will not cover all the information in the paper today.,43,,
244,0.97,1543.742,1547.846,"Instead, again, I will briefly describe what information you will find in the paper.",43,,
245,0.97,1547.846,1554.953,I do have central staff colleagues on the line should you have any immediate questions.,43,,
246,0.97,1554.953,1556.688,We don't develop a Stand-Alone issue I.D.,43,,
247,0.97,1556.688,1562.961,"For every Department or office, but we do review the budget in its entirety.",43,,
248,0.97,1562.961,1568.099,"This highlights the reviews, and the paper is broken into four sections.",43,,
249,0.97,1568.099,1572.437,The first section defines the abbreviations that you will find used throughout the paper.,43,,
250,0.97,1572.437,1581.613,"I will not go into much detail on that, but it's available, and I will walk through what you will find in the other sections of the paper.",43,,
251,0.97,1581.613,1586.785,Section two is sort of about the heart of the paper.,43,,
252,0.97,1586.785,1599.831,"Provides a high-level summary of every Department and office covered in the 2022 proposed budget, and if follows the same proposed budget book.",43,,
253,0.97,1599.831,1605.47,"It's arranged by the six main categories you will find in the budget book, and Alphabetically by Department.",43,,
254,0.97,1605.47,1625.824,"The overview is a resource for the Council and public to quickly review notable changes in the proposed budget, offer concise summary compared to the thorough descriptions you will find in the budget book, 89 through 588 for pages.",43,,
255,0.97,1625.824,1634.299,The 30-Or-So paper highlights the key changes of note in the paper or in each Department.,43,,
256,0.97,1634.299,1650.248,"For each Department we have included a summary table that provides a glimpse in the overall changes of the proposed budgets it shows changes to appropriations and Ftes for the 2022 proposed budget, and it compares to the 2021 adopted budget.",43,,
257,0.97,1650.248,1680.078,"On this slide and the next one, two examples of what you can find in those tables, and it shows overall, the amount of change in the Department, and this is an example of the table that only includes operating funds, and then, a second example if the Department includes a capital budget, and it shows how those specific portions of the budget change overall.",43,,
258,0.97,1680.078,1684.682,"Total in appropriation shifts, and changes in Ftes.",43,,
259,0.97,1684.682,1711.509,"Following the tables in the paper, you will find either for Department offices or Cross- cutting issue areas that are the subject of the central staff stand alone identification, you will find a detailed overview and analysis of the proposed budgets, and for those departments and offices that are not subject to the Stand-Alone paper, you will find the description of notable change in the Department's budget.",43,,
260,0.97,1711.509,1721.853,On the screen is just an even more concise summary than you will find in the paper of the notable changes you may find in the Seattle public utilities' proposed budget.,43,,
261,0.97,1721.853,1731.73,"These are not issues identified by central staff, but just flagging for the Councilmember the changes in the proposed budget that are not technical.",43,,
262,0.97,1731.73,1737.168,"For some departments whose budget is not changing beyond technical amendments, we will have noted that we didn't identify any changes.",43,,
263,0.97,1740.238,1756.921,Section three of the paper describes the 24 pieces of budget lesson that were transmitted with the Mayor's many pieces of the let's will be discussed in the upcoming detail of the identification discussions.,43,,
264,0.97,1756.921,1780.712,"Most of the budget legislation will be introduced in the next week or two, but legislation with significant policy questions to resolve before Council may be making a decision will not be introduced until we better understand how or if certain policies or processes need to be modified in order to implement the Council's budget.",43,,
265,0.97,1780.712,1793.558,And the legislation is organized by categories to just highlight whether or not it's an moment to adopt or endorse the budget related to property taxes etc.,43,,
266,0.97,1793.558,1810.875,"All of the legislation would be necessary to implement the budget as proposed by the Mayor, but not all of it will be necessary to--some pieces of the legislation may not be necessary ultimately in order to implement the Council's budget.",43,,
267,0.97,1810.875,1831.429,"To put a finer point on that, would it be fair to say some of the legislation submitted are policy choices that the Mayor and the executive team has embedded within the proposed budget to the degree that Council has the chance now to draft our own budget response, our policy choices?",44,,
268,0.97,1831.429,1836.334,That's where there's a difference of potential need for the legislation?,44,,
269,0.97,1836.334,1837.268,That is correct.,45,,
270,0.97,1837.268,1838.87,Specific pieces of legislation?,45,,
271,0.97,1838.87,1840.538,That's correct.,46,,
272,0.97,1840.538,1847.712,"In the next presentation on the general fund balancing process, you will see two key examples.",46,,
273,0.97,1847.712,1854.652,One will amend the Jumpstart fund policies and the city's policies for the emergency Fund.,46,,
274,0.97,1854.652,1856.721,Those are policy choices.,46,,
275,0.97,1856.721,1874.005,"It will depend on the direction the Council chooses to go and contributions for reserves, whether or not the changes to the fund policies are necessary and whether or not the policies transmitted by the Mayor are the right policies.",46,,
276,0.97,1874.005,1877.775,You may want amend the policies in a different way.,46,,
277,0.97,1877.775,1898.363,We are holding introductions to introduce the bill that reflects Council's policy priorities and finally the paper includes four descriptions.,46,,
278,0.97,1898.363,1913.044,"There's spending categories we have been getting interest on, including proposed new spending related to affordable housing to implement the green new deal, and the proposed Valley investments.",46,,
279,0.97,1913.044,1917.415,The fourth attachment is an All- In-One table for each Department or office compared to 2021.,46,,
280,0.97,1917.415,1931.696,"Later in the process, and we will be providing a comparison, showing how the Council's budget compares to the 2020 adopted budget, and it's reflected in the balancing package you will vote on towards the end of the process.",46,,
281,0.97,1932.664,1935.366,"So, again this paper is meant to be a resource.",46,,
282,0.97,1935.366,1938.503,We are not going to walk through it in detail today.,46,,
283,0.97,1938.503,1949.681,"That could take the entire day, and I am happy to answer questions because as I mentioned previously, I have my central staff colleagues on the line if there's questions specific to any Department that are urgent to ask now.",46,,
284,0.97,1956.654,1956.788,.,46,,
285,0.97,1956.788,1957.221,"Thank you, Aly.",47,,
286,0.97,1957.221,1957.722,I'm not seeing any hands.,47,,
287,0.97,1965.296,1965.83,Thank you.,48,,
288,0.97,1965.83,1968.766,That's all I have for this piece of the presentation.,48,,
289,0.97,1968.766,1969.133,Wonderful.,49,,
290,0.97,1969.133,1980.345,"Should we move on to the next item of business, or do you have other central staff?",50,,
291,0.97,1980.345,1980.645,Available?,50,,
292,0.97,1980.645,1985.983,Other central staff analysts are available if Councilmembers want to ask a question specific to the overview paper.,51,,
293,0.97,1985.983,1990.555,We will give folks a quick second to get oriented here.,52,,
294,0.97,1990.555,2016.547,"Again, item number two is where we are at for the deliberations today, before we move on to the presentation, and I think from Tom and Aly about revenue and allocation of the resources that the city has received from the general fund budget.",52,,
295,0.97,2016.547,2025.089,"Okay, I'm not seeing any additional questions.",52,,
296,0.97,2025.089,2028.593,"Let's pull up the central staff memo, briefly if we can related to item number two.",52,,
297,0.97,2042.74,2045.343,I'm just having a technical issue.,53,,
298,0.97,2045.343,2045.71,That's okay.,54,,
299,0.97,2045.71,2050.081,One second and I will get the memo on the screen.,55,,

314,0.97,2097.128,2103.201,"You know what, Aly, I think I will save the questions for the next presentation if that's okay with you.",64,,
315,0.97,2103.201,2119.45,"We appreciate the work central staff put into the memos, and some of the questions that will relate to the Department revenue overall, I think we can also come back to at the end of Tom's presentation, too, and we can take questions related to both once we get oriented here.",64,,

323,0.97,2138.669,2141.873,I want to welcome Tom Mikesell to the stage.,68,,
324,0.97,2141.873,2142.74,"Thank you, Tom.",68,,
325,0.97,2142.74,2163.427,"As folks know from the budget actions over the last two years, Tom has really been the engine behind Dissecting the revenue sources and looking at whether or not there's any rock that has been Unturned or any item that was erroneously calculated.",68,,
326,0.97,2163.427,2171.402,We have been able to uncover important opportunities for the Council to right some areas and identify some possible revenue for important investment.,68,,
327,0.97,2171.402,2173.971,"Thank you, Tom, for the work you did.",68,,
328,0.97,2173.971,2177.942,I will let you take it away.,68,,
329,0.97,2177.942,2182.613,"Thank you for the introduction, Madam chair.",69,,
330,0.97,2182.613,2182.98,Good morning.,69,,
331,0.97,2182.98,2191.455,I'm Tom Mikesell with central staff.,69,,
332,0.97,2191.455,2193.925,"There is, I believe, 20-Some- page paper that provides analysis.",69,,
333,0.97,2193.925,2198.629,I will give an overview of the high points from that paper.,69,,
334,0.97,2198.629,2222.286,"Topics will be covering this morning will be the closing out of the status of the 2021 general fund adjustments for review of the 2022 proposed budget for the general fund for the Mayor, looking at revenues and expenditures, and the impacts of various stages in the budget proposal on the tracking of the balance and the general fund.",69,,
335,0.97,2222.286,2256.621,"Due to some policy changes, our propose policy changes that Aly mentioned in her overview of the budget, we are also going to focus on the implications of the Mayor's general fund proposal of the Jumpstart funding plan as adopted by Council earlier in the year, and finally offer up some issues that have been identified through my analysis and some options that were identified prior to those issues.",69,,
336,0.97,2256.621,2264.462,"So this first slide, it actually covers information up to page five in the memo on the agenda.",69,,
337,0.97,2264.462,2274.905,"I'm not going to cover all of the details, given the focus of the budget deliberation process is on the 2022 budget.",69,,
338,0.97,2274.905,2282.813,I want to go through the various stages of the deliberation because there's been much action with adjusting the budget and dealing with the Covid response.,69,,
339,0.97,2282.813,2298.562,"It's worth mentioning, and it also provides a good launching point for the 2022 discussion, so this first column of the first table, it's the 2021 budget adopted by Council last November.",69,,
340,0.97,2298.562,2302.066,There's been a number of technical and supplemental changes laid into the budget.,69,,
341,0.97,2302.066,2316.714,"Earlier in the year, some of those include some automatic carry forwards of the amounts approved but not fully spent or receives in the prior years of 2020.",69,,
342,0.97,2316.714,2355.453,"Those happened without need for further Council authorization, and there was a comprehensive carry forward bill proposed to Council, passed by Council earlier in the year, and it provided legislative authority for those amounts that did not automatically carry forward, and there was a Mid-Year supplemental and grant package that was Deliberated in the Finance and housing Committee, and passed by Council, and in the summer, and then finally there, actually this is the next layer, Covid relief recovery measures.",69,,
343,0.97,2355.453,2368.065,"No fewer than seven pieces of Stand-Alone legislation, largely geared Covid-19 relief and recovery measures that are ongoing for the 2021 budget.",69,,
344,0.97,2368.065,2372.67,Also two adjustments to the city budget offices revenue forecast.,69,,
345,0.97,2372.67,2378.943,"One in April, and the most recent one in August.",69,,
346,0.97,2378.943,2401.732,"Those increased the revenues by approximately $71 million or 4.5% over the 2021 adopted forecast, and also this accounts for Mercier Megablock sale deeds, originally intended to be received in 2020, and totally about $66.5 million.",69,,
347,0.97,2401.732,2405.703,"However, receipt of the proceeds are delayed, instead received in 2021.",69,,
348,0.97,2405.703,2424.422,"I want to note that is just recognizing a movement of cash between fiscal years, and it doesn't represent any additional resources to spend because those moneys have been fully allocated in the budget.",69,,
349,0.97,2424.422,2431.862,"And then Finally, the most Salant piece of discussion the year end supplement.",69,,
350,0.97,2431.862,2433.864,"The impact of $3.6 million, which I will cover on the next slide.",69,,
351,0.97,2441.038,2445.543,The 2021 revised budget is balanced.,69,,
352,0.97,2445.543,2456.854,"In prior years, Council has received up to three different supplemental bills with the final one taking the form of the fourth supplemental.",69,,
353,0.97,2456.854,2466.597,It has been normally transmitted to the Council in December of the budget year.,69,,
354,0.97,2466.597,2481.712,This sequencing of the supplemental bill mean there is are financial decisions that affect the budget that are not fully included in the more robust November budget process that the Council engages in.,69,,
355,0.97,2481.712,2508.672,"Under the direction of the budget chair, the city budget office and executive has, instead, taken a different approach to the supplemental budgeting for this fiscal year, and by way of a process that rolls normally the fourth quarter adjustments into a Year- end supplemental process, included as part of the overall budget process.",69,,
356,0.97,2508.672,2520.184,What has been transmitted from the executive is the supplemental package increasing the general revenues by $3.9 million.,69,,
357,0.97,2520.184,2524.955,I think the numbers are wrong.,69,,
358,0.97,2524.955,2525.256,Apologies.,69,,
359,0.97,2525.256,2525.689,"No, that's correct.",69,,
360,0.97,2525.689,2543.374,"Increases the general fund revenue by $3.9 million because of grants accepted and cuts the general fund expenditures by $376,000 largely due to the closeout of a few reserves and finance in general.",69,,
361,0.97,2543.374,2552.216,The memo included with the agenda item is a full list of the grants proposed for acceptance by Council.,69,,
362,0.97,2552.216,2595.893,"Finally, given that we will not be transmitting a fourth quarter supplement, the city budget office is intending to transmit an amendment or just an updated version of the Year- end supplemental bill in early November that will then be introduced as the full year-end supplemental grants package, given they don't know what form that will take and what implications will be, they are giving $2 million for a backstop for unforseen items that may take form in that update.",69,,
363,0.97,2595.893,2609.974,"Colleagues, because we went through the first two portions so quickly, I want to encourage you if you have questions as Tom is presenting, raise your hand, and we will Intersperse them throughout.",70,,
364,0.97,2609.974,2611.108,Given the time we have.,70,,
365,0.97,2611.108,2615.145,"We do have 2 1/2 hours, and feel free to ask the questions as we go along.",70,,
366,0.97,2615.145,2621.719,I have a comment I will make here to lift up what director handy said.,70,,
367,0.97,2621.719,2638.602,"I think director handy put it very clear that--but for the work this Council did last year, following the lead of what the community was calling for, and large coalition, if it wasn't for that payroll progressive tax, we would be seeing an All-Cuts budget.",70,,
368,0.97,2638.602,2683.147,"It's fair to say this balanced budget is brought to you because of the good work that the community and you all did to pass Jumpstart progressive revenue, and I think the questions director handy outlined whether or not those are the ways in which we had directed the executive to use the dollars is what we are going to discuss later today, but I want to thank you for your work last year, and the work that it took over the years for the call for Progressive revenue from the community because we have the opportunity to make sure the balanced budget by the time it's approved reflects the values and priorities of the Council.",70,,
369,0.97,2683.147,2685.883,"Thank you, director for the opening comments and the proposed budget.",70,,
370,0.97,2685.883,2699.963,"If you have any concerns or disagree with what I just said, of course, central staff, feel free to correct me, but I thought it was an important element to Relift up here as we look at the good news you shared about it being balanced and recognizing how come and why it's balanced here today.",70,,
371,0.97,2699.963,2700.731,Okay.,70,,
372,0.97,2702.533,2703.4,I'm not seeing any hands.,70,,
373,0.97,2703.4,2703.934,Let's go ahead and continue.,70,,
374,0.97,2710.14,2710.774,"Okay, Madame chair.",71,,
375,0.97,2710.774,2717.715,Now we are going to launch into the discussion of the 2020 propose general fund budget.,71,,
376,0.97,2717.715,2734.198,"The first question, why the general Fund and not the other funds, and the reason for that because most city departments have some funding from the general Fund, and some are completely funded from the general fund.",71,,
377,0.97,2734.198,2744.441,It's a Catch-All funding source for most general government programs and services that the city of Seattle provides.,71,,
378,0.97,2744.441,2750.28,So comments for the remainder of my presentation will follow this central outline.,71,,
379,0.97,2750.28,2762.659,"Looking at the baseline general fund budget, what it costs to maintain the services that have been approved in prior budgets, and how much revenue is anticipated to support that.",71,,
380,0.97,2762.659,2769.266,We will look at it positive to the fiscal reserves.,71,,
381,0.97,2769.266,2784.014,"That's proposed in the budget, and as mentioned, implications for the jump start spending plan that allows some level of support for the general fund if the revenues have not fully recovered to Precovid levels.",71,,
382,0.97,2784.014,2835.098,"We will look at the implications of that, and also we will look at the equitable communities initiative that had presence in the 2020 proposed budget and once again has been Reproposed in somewhat different funding structure in the proposed 2022 budget, and look at also, other key spending items that have been proposed for funding in the 2022 budget, and finally look and change the lens to look at the implications of the general fund of largely because of the general fund back fill and also because of how the Mayor has proposed spending through the Jumpstart Fund, and look at the proposed policy change and what the implications are for the spending plan items in the Jumpstart fund ordinance.",71,,
383,0.97,2835.098,2835.632,Thank you very much.,72,,
384,0.97,2835.632,2848.879,"Just to Orient us, this is the slide that covers the material in Tom's memo that starts on age 7 to page 25.",72,,
385,0.97,2848.879,2864.661,"Going forward we will cover page 7 to 25 here, and the previous slide was an overview of the information in the central staff pages 1 to 7. if you're following along with the memo, which is very detailed as well.",72,,
386,0.97,2864.661,2874.538,"Greatly appreciate the work in the staff memo, and flip to page 7, and we will walk through the materials in the central staff memo and the charts and the data that Tom has pulled up for us.",72,,
387,0.97,2874.538,2892.456,"Also, just to Orient us, on item number four here, equitable communities initiative, this is the Mayor's task force that she convened last year, related to investments, and I want to make sure if you're looking for shorthand, that's task force.",72,,
388,0.97,2892.456,2902.266,I don't want folks to get equitable communities initiative and equitable housing.,72,,
389,0.97,2902.266,2910.307,"That's the task force recommendations no additional hands, let's keep going.",72,,
390,0.97,2911.842,2912.242,.,72,,
391,0.97,2912.242,2932.029,"Thank you, Okay, so now launching into the technical items of the presentation, and this, just the first, kind of a Foundational purposes, and I will explain how the slide works.",73,,
392,0.97,2932.029,2946.576,There are several versions of the slide as we track through the incremental adds and how they impact the balance of the general fund.,73,,
393,0.97,2946.576,2951.448,Moving from top left going Blockwise.,73,,
394,0.97,2951.448,2957.721,"First, you will see what it is, the subject matter we are talking about.",73,,
395,0.97,2957.721,2958.555,The 2022 baseline.,73,,
396,0.97,2958.555,3000.664,"Below that are the numbers that drive the chart, and key number is the baseline balance, indicating if the balance is positive or negative, and a bit of technical information provided below that, and just explaining the key details of the adjustment, and then the graph, and you know, Familiar- looking bar graph, measuring the running totals of the expenditures and revenues based on changes, and the yellow box on the bottom, just further explaining what it is, if it's a shortfall, balance, or surplus, based on the particular change.",73,,
397,0.97,3000.664,3011.007,"Again, there will be a number of slides in this format, and hopefully that helps Orient to how to understand and interpret the information.",73,,
398,0.97,3011.007,3018.615,So by way of the detail about this particular slide and the information it contains.,73,,
399,0.97,3018.615,3064.661,"This is the--essentially the look at where the general fund stands after rolling the 2021 adopted budget programs that are slated to continue into the future years, and adjusting for technical costs such as inflation, health care changes, things like that, and then accounting for what the baseline revenue forecast is from the city budget office, and you can see there, there is approximately $1.43 billion of revenue in the baseline forecast, and then that is in place to fund 1.48 baseline billion of baseline expenditures in the general fund.",73,,
400,0.97,3064.661,3081.545,"As you can see, it results in a $51 million shortfall to maintain ongoing services in the general fund.",73,,
401,0.97,3081.545,3123.153,"So just going in order, one item proposed in the budget that had a deposit for the fiscal reserves, before going into that, the deposit, it's important to look at the track record since starting Covid, '19 recession, and impacts on how the city has deployed to key reserves to address the emergencies, both on a public health needs basis and as well as a revenue loss basis.",73,,
402,0.97,3123.153,3134.431,"So at the city of Seattle, we have two primary general governmental reserves that can be used.",73,,
403,0.97,3134.431,3142.172,"First there's the revenue stabilization Fund, and it's in place for down turns in revenues because of recessions or other impacts.",73,,
404,0.97,3142.172,3154.05,"The emergency Fund, which is a pool of money that is available to deal with natural disasters, public health emergencies, things of that nature.",73,,
405,0.97,3154.05,3164.628,Things that require a swift response and a pot of money available to help deal with the response.,73,,
406,0.97,3164.628,3167.23,Given the obvious resource constraints.,73,,
407,0.97,3167.23,3188.351,"Going into the 2020 fiscal year, we had $60.8 million in revenue stabilization Fund and $66.9 million in the emergency fund based on the Policie that were in place at that time for the balance in reserves of $128 million.",73,,
408,0.97,3188.351,3188.685,You it see.,73,,
409,0.97,3188.685,3198.428,I don't go into detail about the specific changes.,73,,
410,0.97,3198.428,3241.237,"Through 2020 revised budget adjustments taken place as Council and Mayor Rebudgetted for Covid-19 and impacts on revenues, a number of measures adopted in 2020 that deployed a total of about $3 million of reserves, and 2021 adopted budget used $39 million in reserves, taking reserves down to a level of approximately $6 million in the revenue stabilization Fund, and approximately $33 million in the emergency Fund.",73,,
411,0.97,3241.237,3249.879,"The 2022 proposed budget includes deposits to each Fund, which I will cover in the next slide.",73,,
412,0.97,3249.879,3250.947,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",74,,
413,0.97,3250.947,3270.3,Are we going to get further into the issues that the central staff memo raised about the proposed contributions to the revenue stabilization fund compared to what current city policy is verses proposed new policy?,75,,
414,0.97,3275.672,3277.574,"Yes, absolutely will.",76,,
415,0.97,3277.574,3278.475,I will hold my question.,76,,
416,0.97,3278.475,3282.779,If I could NOTE for the folks following along at home.,77,,
417,0.97,3282.779,3299.696,"As we were preparing Tom's talking points for the presentation, we realize this would make more sense before slide six, and a couple of tables will show up slightly out of order from the presentation on the posted agenda.",77,,
418,0.97,3299.696,3302.832,The numbers are still correct on the screen.,77,,
419,0.97,3302.832,3307.37,"It was slide seven, but it's coming before slide six.",77,,
420,0.97,3307.37,3326.456,"Later in the presentation we moved slides 11 and 12 before 10 because it provides the details, and Tom will speak to that, and all go together, but we wanted to note that for people following along at home, and this is slide seven, and then moving to six, and I don't want people to get confused.",77,,
421,0.97,3326.456,3340.57,"Okay, so the slide number will stay the same, so that, of course will align with whatever slide you're projecting.",78,,
422,0.97,3340.57,3347.344,There's other Councilmembers with notes corresponding to the slide numbers.,78,,
423,0.97,3347.344,3349.112,Goo D question Councilmember Herbold.,78,,
424,0.97,3349.112,3353.516,We will come back to you to get the question fully addressed in a minute.,78,,
425,0.97,3353.516,3361.191,"Thank you for pointing that out, Aly about the slide switch.",79,,
426,0.97,3361.191,3366.863,This slide encompasses information on the memo on page nine of the memo.,79,,
427,0.97,3366.863,3379.843,"As Councilmember Herbold helpfully pointed out or led into, there's a proposed policy change that supports the Mayor's planned deposits.",79,,
428,0.97,3379.843,3410.34,"First to provide information about what the current policy would require, current policy would require the city deposits 0.25% of General fund tax revenues into the revenue stabilization fund in the first year revenues begin growing, and that would be about $3.1 million based on the current policy, so a deposit into the Reserve revenue stabilization fund of $3.1 million.",79,,
429,0.97,3410.34,3420.683,"Prothe perspective of the emergency Fund, the policy does not allow for a similar sequenced repayment structure.",79,,
430,0.97,3420.683,3429.893,"It essentially says in the year following a use of the emergency Fund, the balance shall be replenished to the full policy level.",79,,
431,0.97,3429.893,3459.055,"For the case of the emergency Fund, the policy level is $60,000 or $60 million, inflated by growth in the Cpiu for the Seattle area, and that would be a higher amount, and it would be a total--require a total deposit to the emergency fund of $37.5 million in the 2022 budget.",79,,
432,0.97,3459.055,3479.576,"So in essence, the current policies would require a $40.6 million deposit into our combined reserves, whereas, the Mayor's proposed budget deposits $25 million.",79,,
433,0.97,3479.576,3496.96,"As far as the details the emergency Fund, proposed policy change would change it into a sequenced process allowing for replenishment over four or five years.",79,,
434,0.97,3496.96,3511.507,"This year, the proposed 2020 year or 2022 year plus four additional years, and then that is the $10 million included in the proposed budget.",79,,
435,0.97,3511.507,3522.919,"The revenue stabilization Fund, and the proposed budget is simply depositing more into the fund than is purely required by law, and current city ordinance.",79,,
436,0.97,3522.919,3525.889,There is no policy change that is proposed.,79,,
437,0.97,3525.889,3548.144,"There is nothing that prevents the city from depositing the higher amount in either of the reserves, up to a current maximum balance amount allowed in the stabilization Fund, but that does not pose constraints on the current budget.",79,,
438,0.97,3548.144,3575.071,"So when the $25 million from the--or assuming the policy change is in place, the Mayor's budget would place $25 million from the general fund into the fiscal reserves, and it would bring the running tally of the baseline to negative $75 million in 2022.",79,,
439,0.97,3575.071,3575.638,Please go ahead.,80,,
440,0.97,3575.638,3592.522,I'm wondering whether or not central staff had a chance to check with director noble since he came and visited us a couple of weeks ago to give the presentation on the Mayor's proposed budget.,81,,
441,0.97,3592.522,3632.729,"The reason why I ask, particular to this question whether talking about the Mayor's proposed budget contribution to the two funds, the impression I received is that the Mayor's budget was proposing to commit more than what was legally required under current policy, and I'm just really curious as to what was intended by that particular message, if anyone had a chance to fact check after the presentation.",81,,
442,0.97,3636.833,3638.668,Sure.,82,,
443,0.97,3638.668,3654.317,"Vice chair Herbold, I have had some conversations, and I would say this is just generally a different way that central staff verses the executive approaches the discussion of the budget and why we unpack it using Council's policy lens.",83,,
444,0.97,3654.317,3671.467,"The proposed budget from the executive's position is assuming adoption of all the legislation that is transmitted with the budget, so they are not required to submit to the Council a current law budget.",83,,
445,0.97,3671.467,3691.02,"Their proposed budget is assuming Council APPROVES, so that, you know, the language may not have been as precise in their response to the questions, but their proposal is, in fact, assuming Council APPROVES the policy change, depositing more money than required by law into the fiscal reserves.",83,,
446,0.97,3691.02,3704.167,"Our perspective is we first need to represent what would be required today, so you would know whether or not you want to approve that policy change moving forward.",83,,
447,0.97,3704.167,3707.904,It's part of what we do here on central staff.,83,,
448,0.97,3707.904,3719.916,"That is present the proposed budget using the policy frame, and that is the distinction, but I don't think there's disagreement about what current law would have required.",83,,
449,0.97,3719.916,3720.283,Thank you.,84,,
450,0.97,3720.283,3735.832,"I thought I was asking the question about what would be required under current law because I didn't get no about the new proposed law, but I appreciate understanding the different perspective we bring to unpacking the budget.",84,,
451,0.97,3735.832,3738.868,"I think it's a really excellent question, vice chair Herbold.",85,,
452,0.97,3738.868,3740.903,Thank you for putting it out there.,85,,
453,0.97,3740.903,3748.678,I think it would be most folks understanding the proposed budget would need to come down complying with current law.,85,,
454,0.97,3748.678,3758.121,"As the memo outlined and was touched on in earlier presentations, and really exposed in the memo from central staff.",85,,
455,0.97,3758.121,3799.729,"The legislation that has accompanied the proposed budget is a very different policy choice, and so, I would want to lift up the language on top of page nine of the memo here, and it says the 2022 proposed budget package includes the budget legislation that would change the jump start fund policies, and it goes on to say the proposed budget legislation would completely rescind the spending plan for the 2023 and beyond Jumpstart spend plan, allowing for ongoing use of the payroll expense tax revenues to support the general fund for uses that are inconsistent with the spending plan established when the payroll expense tax was authorized by Council.",85,,
456,0.97,3799.729,3806.702,That to me is the crux of the difference in analysis in how the gap was closed.,85,,
457,0.97,3806.702,3810.64,I want to ask the question that leads into that.,85,,
458,0.97,3810.64,3827.59,"I guess, to be clear, what we are seeing here, from your presentation, thus far, is that absent, Nongeneral fund services, we would be $50 million short for next year's budget, correct?",85,,
459,0.97,3827.59,3829.692,That's correct.,86,,
460,0.97,3829.692,3843.639,"On top of that, with the additional spending that has been proposed in this budget, we see that gap even grow further to 75 million?",87,,
461,0.97,3843.639,3844.373,Is that correct?,87,,
462,0.97,3844.373,3845.107,Yes.,88,,
463,0.97,3845.107,3845.808,That is correct.,88,,
464,0.97,3845.808,3853.382,"You will see with the progressive slides, this is just one step in that analysis, but that is an accurate statement.",88,,
465,0.97,3853.382,3883.279,"You know, I would just add in, this is our sort of reconstruction of the proposed budget, so we always start with sort of baseline expenditures and revenues, and then layer in the sort of new spending or contributions to emergency funds, and then show how they are addressing the gap, and in this case, you will see, I don't think I'm stealing the punch line, but the jump start fund comes in to fill the gap.",89,,
466,0.97,3883.279,3895.057,"So, that is sort of how we build it start to finish, how big the gap would be, but for other supplements to the general fund.",89,,
467,0.97,3903.132,3915.044,So that's a good discussion to launch into--not to go full bore into the Jumpstart Fund.,90,,
468,0.97,3915.044,3918.314,It's in later portions of the presentation.,90,,
469,0.97,3918.314,3949.612,"Because of the general fund's reliance on the revenue from the Jumpstart Fund and a proposed policy change that would increase the reliance to a higher amount, I thought it was useful to stop or to place this table in the presentation and make a memo to reposition what was adopted by the city council.",90,,
470,0.97,3949.612,3957.119,With ordinance 126-393 that created the Jumpstart Fund and spending plan.,90,,
471,0.97,3957.119,3960.122,"A little history, covered in the memo.",90,,
472,0.97,3960.122,3966.228,"I don't have detailed slides, but to provide the tracking to how we got here.",90,,
473,0.97,3966.228,3994.724,"In July of 2020, city council passed a progressive payroll expense tax on business payroll or businesses with business payrolls in the city of Seattle, and accompanying that tax legislation there was an ordinance and resolution that put in place a set of spending criteria with percentages what the new revenues were supposed to be used for.",90,,
474,0.97,3994.724,4018.681,"In the 2021 budget, given the revenue pressures caused by Covid response and the recession that resulted, was there some Alliance for Jumpstart fund payroll tax fund supporting the general fund in that budget, however, it was not originally contemplated beyond 2021.",90,,
475,0.97,4018.681,4040.136,"The ordinance resolution of the spending plans in 2020, requested an implementation plan of how payroll expense tax revenues would be used in future budgets and how they were going to be the spending plan that was put in place by Council, and there was no implementation plan received.",90,,
476,0.97,4040.136,4044.974,It was expected in June of '21.,90,,
477,0.97,4044.974,4065.895,"No implementation plan was received, and Council passed ordinance 126-393, creating the Jumpstart Fund and created the ordinance of the spending plan from the prior ordinance and resolutions in 2020.",90,,
478,0.97,4065.895,4070.566,"So with the budget proposal, we have the de facto spending plan from the executive.",90,,
479,0.97,4070.566,4098.294,"There will be points in the presentation comparing the proposal against this, and it is the taking of the revenue projection and running through the ordinance requirements to determine how much will go to the general Fund and how much will go for the various program areas included in the Jumpstart funding spending plan.",90,,
480,0.97,4098.294,4120.816,"At this point the key piece of information is section two of this table, comparing from the Jumpstart ordinance the Precovid revenue baseline, and this is essentially the baseline for revenue for 2022 based on forecasts done prior to the Covid-19 emergency.",90,,
481,0.97,4120.816,4135.831,It was how much revenue we expected to get Precovid.,90,,
482,0.97,4135.831,4153.149,"The line below that, the proposed revenue forecast from CBO for the same resources, and that determines how much of the general fund can be back filled from the Jumpstart fund on the ordinance adopted.",90,,
483,0.97,4153.149,4167.663,"I would pause to say as I mentioned in the original ordinance and resolution from July of 2020, it did not contemplate the additional back fill.",90,,
484,0.97,4167.663,4184.914,"It was an allowance added in the Jumpstart fund ordinance adopted this year, and with the understanding there may still be lingering effects from the economic impacts locally and nationally from the Covid-19 recession.",90,,
485,0.97,4184.914,4195.991,"The jump start Fund, original plan was adjusted to accommodate that and provide $85 million Backfill to the general fund.",90,,
486,0.97,4195.991,4203.933,"The remaining components, I will talk about it in the context of the Jumpstart fund later.",90,,
487,0.97,4203.933,4215.945,And so this slide just adds the $85 million of back fill amount into the running calculation of the baseline balance in the general fund.,90,,
488,0.97,4215.945,4253.816,"As you can see, very clearly, the--I believe it was $76 million or so deficit, prior to the back fill, with the jump start support, and it provided in the spending plan in the jump start policy, now a $9.4 million surplus, and so, in essence, the amount of back fill allowed in the back start spending plan served the purpose of back filling the ongoing as much ass adopted in the prior budget and replacing or supporting the revenues that have not fully recovered.",90,,
489,0.97,4260.589,4261.156,And so --,90,,
490,0.97,4261.156,4276.939,"Tom, as you go along, could you tell us which page in the memo your slides correspond with so folks can follow along?",91,,
491,0.97,4276.939,4277.84,Will do.,92,,
492,0.97,4277.84,4282.978,So now I believe this is page 11 of the memo.,93,,
493,0.97,4282.978,4286.849,We are getting into more Policy- focused spending.,93,,
494,0.97,4286.849,4295.457,The prior amounts of spending have been more technical and continuation of baseline.,93,,
495,0.97,4295.457,4307.936,"With regards to the equitable communities initiative, again, historical reference, it is important to offer.",93,,
496,0.97,4307.936,4316.712,It was originally proposed by the Mayor at a level of $100 million in finance general Reserve.,93,,
497,0.97,4316.712,4353.849,"Given that the budget proposal submitted by the Mayor in 2021 included not only support from the Jumpstart or payroll expense tax, but significant contributions from the Reserve only one-time in nature and other one-time Federal assistance, council Repurposed the $100 million allocation in the budget, and it was ongoing, proposed as ongoing into a set of one-time investments in the budget.",93,,
498,0.97,4353.849,4364.827,"Notable amongst those, listed on page 11 of the memo.",93,,
499,0.97,4364.827,4366.161,Prepispatoy budget.,93,,
500,0.97,4366.161,4367.596,Eci from now on.,93,,
501,0.97,4367.596,4379.508,$18Million purposed with the cuts from the Seattle police Department budget to provide a $30 million one-time allocation for the budgeting in 2021.,93,,
502,0.97,4379.508,4405.3,"There was a $30 million allocation for the strategic investment fund, originally in the 2020 budget, and it's part of the Mayor's proposal, cutting that original $30 million to the strategic investment fund, and then just rolled it into the $100 million proposal from the Mayor's budget.",93,,
503,0.97,4405.3,4417.112,Council basically replaced that strategic investment fund from 2020 and put it back in place in 2021 as a one-time invest.,93,,
504,0.97,4417.112,4456.952,"One-time investments for Community-Led safety projects in Hsd, human services Department, and there was a transfer to the emergency fund of $10.3 million, also one time paired with General fund resources to gross up to $33.7 million, and there were amounts for OCR alternatives and office enforceable rights alternatives, and Fundings for organizations pursuing the alternatives from harms from the criminal legal system, and half a million dollars for restorative justice pilot.",93,,
505,0.97,4456.952,4463.992,The remainder after the adjustments left $29.9 million for DCI as a one time investment in 2021.,93,,
506,0.97,4463.992,4469.331,The city council placed a proviso on those funds or a couple of Provisos.,93,,
507,0.97,4469.331,4493.522,"The critical one for the analysis is a proviso that requested the task force created by Eci would come to Council and present a plan for the use of those 2021 moneys, and then the Council could lift the proviso, allowing the moneys to be spent from the city budget.",93,,
508,0.97,4493.522,4525.854,"The ordinance 126.401 shown here was essentially the form of the Council authorization to lift the proviso on the funds in the budget, and so what you can see here compares now, and now shifting gears into the 2020 proposed budget shows the amounts of the one-time appropriations for Eci, and then what the similar corollary amounts are in the budget.",93,,
509,0.97,4525.854,4542.804,"One key distinction of the 2021, ordinance 12461, authorize the expenditure of the spending, and then that's just the budget speak for meaning those moneys will go go away until fully spent.",93,,
510,0.97,4542.804,4552.08,"If there's $30 million, that budget will remain in place until it's fully spent from the budget or otherwise lapses.",93,,
511,0.97,4552.08,4584.112,"So the appropriations and one- time in 2021 now proposed as ongoing appropriations for the 2022 budget, and however, the original allocation for '21 was completely 100% general Fund, and you will see in this table, there now the proposed budget includes approximately $12.8 million in the general Fund, and approximately $17.2 million in the Jumpstat Fund.",93,,
512,0.97,4584.112,4608.904,"So this is the Eci look at how Jumpstart fund moneys are used, and you can see similar programs in the Jumpstart funding spending plan, and because they are Dually purposed to meet Eci task force recommendations, as well as Jumpstart funding, spending priorities.",93,,
513,0.97,4608.904,4623.018,"I think it's just important to note here, and we will keep coming back to this point and sort of the high-level questions director handy raised in her introductory remarks today.",94,,
514,0.97,4623.018,4644.64,"While the proposed task force investments are split in the proposed budget between general Fund and the Jumpstart Fund, based on our analysis to date, these Proposedgoing expenditures will require ongoing reliance on the Jumpstart fund moving forward.",94,,
515,0.97,4644.64,4664.026,"If Council agrees with this proposal and APPROVES this ongoing spending, absent another revenue source or reductions in other areas of the city budget t will be continued reliance on the Jumpstart Fund, and we are going to keep saying that over and over again over the next three days.",94,,
516,0.97,4664.026,4667.195,"Thank you, Aly.",95,,
517,0.97,4667.195,4669.898,That's a good reminder.,95,,
518,0.97,4669.898,4694.456,"Originally proposed and indicates in the CBO presentation on the item, it was proposed the task force would identify new progressive revenue source to fund the investments, and as of now there's not been an additional revenue source identified, hence the additional reliance on the fund in the 2022 budget.",95,,
519,0.97,4694.456,4697.392,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",96,,
520,0.97,4697.392,4698.293,Thank you.,97,,
521,0.97,4698.293,4727.222,"Just to try to dial down a little bit on the expectations, Tom, I heard you say that the expectation was that the task force would make a recommendation for an ongoing revenue source, and the central staff memo quotes the Mayor discussed proposing an equity fund or new proposed revenue for sustained funding for the commitment to the future years.",98,,
522,0.97,4727.222,4739.134,"I recognize the intention would be an ongoing revenue of some sort, and source of some sort, so we could sustain these investments.",98,,
523,0.97,4739.134,4747.242,"I have met with the Eci task force, and I'm sure other Councilmembers have as well.",98,,
524,0.97,4747.242,4762.29,"They have declined to identify an ongoing revenue source, and it's my understanding from reading the memo that it was the Mayor who had intended to propose an ongoing revenue source.",98,,
525,0.97,4762.29,4762.924,Just want to clarify.,98,,
526,0.97,4762.924,4766.628,I want to ask you to clarify that if you could.,98,,
527,0.97,4766.628,4766.928,Thank you.,98,,
528,0.97,4766.928,4767.996,"Yeah, thank you.",99,,
529,0.97,4767.996,4771.233,Thank you vice chair Herbold.,99,,
530,0.97,4771.233,4771.633,That is accurate.,99,,
531,0.97,4771.633,4779.875,The quote from the slide is the kind of record on the item.,99,,
532,0.97,4779.875,4782.344,It's perhaps informal commentary for my comments.,99,,
533,0.97,4782.344,4788.483,"So for the record, that, I believe was placed on the executive branch to come up with the revenue backstop.",99,,
534,0.97,4788.483,4794.856,And do we have any information about why that never occurred?,100,,
535,0.97,4794.856,4807.836,Why it was never a proposal for the ongoing revenue source to fund this ongoing commitment?,100,,
536,0.97,4807.836,4816.244,Rather than using Jumpstart that already had a spend plan and legislative objectives.,100,,
537,0.97,4816.244,4821.583,"No, vice chair, I have not heard any further information on that.",101,,
538,0.97,4821.583,4825.02,"Yeah, I would just Chime in to say I'm also not aware of the choice by the executive.",102,,
539,0.97,4827.722,4832.327,Thank you very much vice chair.,103,,
540,0.97,4832.327,4856.418,"I appreciate the slides here, and I would NOTE on page 14 of the memo, you can see the two slides that Tom showed from the chart that shows the investments in the task force recommendations, and side by side, to see the totaling of $30 million from how the recommendations we received from the task force do get to 30 million.",103,,
541,0.97,4856.418,4874.536,"I will put out there, colleagues, I, too, have had conversations with the folks from task force members and the budgeting work, and there is ongoing interest in making sure we are maintaining 30 million so the identified priorities get the funding needed.",103,,
542,0.97,4874.536,4877.939,"I want to make sure, though, they fully understand the Underspend.",103,,
543,0.97,4877.939,4885.714,"What Tom noted in the memo and now as well, there's the ability for those dollars to carry forward if they have not been used.",103,,
544,0.97,4885.714,4900.695,"Given how late some of the contracts went out last year, we know there's a significant of the $30 million Underspent in 2021, and I would like to see that reflected in the 2022 budget to true up the investments in the $30 million as committed.",103,,
545,0.97,4900.695,4907.435,"That said, I also think it is important for there to be sustained revenue for these important investments.",103,,
546,0.97,4907.435,4935.897,"In some ways, there's cross over with some of the priorities in Jumpstart, but if the initial intention was to make sure there was a sustained sole source of revenue, it's an important conversation for us to encourage on the policy side, and keeping the task force and the budgeting investments at $30 million, that's an important investment, I think, going forward, and I want to make sure it's reflect in the budget.",103,,
547,0.97,4935.897,4937.399,"Councilmember Juarez, I see your hand as well.",103,,
548,0.97,4937.399,4948.376,"I was going to start with a thank you for being on the Council representative on the task force, but thank you for your work and for the work of the task force.",103,,
549,0.97,4948.376,4950.478,I will turn to you for your next comments.,103,,
550,0.97,4950.478,4955.917,I want to note so we can remember what happened in July and how this got passed.,104,,
551,0.97,4955.917,4962.891,All of the credit goes to black leaders for Eci.,104,,
552,0.97,4962.891,4972.3,"Originally Eci was as you remember, 100 million and we cut 70 and made it 30.",104,,
553,0.97,4972.3,4975.837,We can do the budgeting and Eci together.,104,,
554,0.97,4975.837,4979.741,"It makes the black community stronger, leadership stronger, and it empowers them to do the things you need.",104,,
555,0.97,4979.741,4982.777,You don't have to have one program.,104,,
556,0.97,4982.777,4984.579,We can do two.,104,,
557,0.97,4984.579,4985.847,They are not competing.,104,,
558,0.97,4985.847,4987.482,They have overlapped and dove tailed quite nicely.,104,,
559,0.97,4987.482,4990.118,I'm very happy to hear that.,104,,
560,0.97,4990.118,4996.057,I know they have met the Eci task force members have met with Councilmembers individually.,104,,
561,0.97,4996.057,5009.804,"It's good that Jumpstart can fund the Eci at 30 million for now, and hold on to the money until they can spend it, and I guess this time next year we will look at if it's sustainable, and that's probably for next year, if that's a fair statement to make, so thank you.",104,,
562,0.97,5011.439,5012.006,Thank you.,105,,
563,0.97,5012.006,5018.913,I am--I do need to make sure I Orient us to the conversation around the 100 million.,105,,
564,0.97,5018.913,5024.719,"It wasn't a $70 million cut, and I do --",105,,
565,0.97,5024.719,5026.02,Okay.,106,,
566,0.97,5026.02,5028.823,I think it's the information for slide 12.,107,,
567,0.97,5028.823,5030.425,It gets to your point.,107,,
568,0.97,5030.425,5031.593,"Not slide 12, excuse me.",107,,
569,0.97,5031.593,5032.961,Page 12 of the memo.,107,,
570,0.97,5032.961,5039.3,I think there's a way to show exactly what you mentioned Councilmember Juarez.,107,,
571,0.97,5039.3,5040.068,These investments can coexist.,107,,
572,0.97,5040.068,5059.354,"It was not a reduction or a cut to the task force, if the task force was brand new and proposed last year, what we did was maintain the commitment to the Mercier mega investments for the strategic investment fund specifically for the communities.",107,,
573,0.97,5059.354,5091.953,"We allocated 30 million to create harmony between the Bipoc investments for the Particpatoy budgeting to the tune of $10 million, getting us to $100 million if there was at $100 million threshold, the line drawn in the sand, but we did additional investments in office of civil rights alternatives, transferred money to make sure there was funding for emergency funds so our communities are specifically supported.",107,,
574,0.97,5091.953,5112.54,"I want to make sure that folks don't take away there was a cut to the task force in dollars, instead it was exactly what you mentioned, and it was showing that these investments can exist simultaneous, and they are all needed to create a more stable and healthy and safe community.",107,,
575,0.97,5112.54,5112.774,Great.,107,,
576,0.97,5112.774,5121.416,"So for folks who want to see the bullets there, that is also on page 12 of the memo.",107,,
577,0.97,5121.416,5130.091,"Chair Mosqueda, I want to respond a little as well to Councilmember Juarez's statement in terms of the decision this year verses the decision next year.",108,,
578,0.97,5130.091,5156.117,"I just want to note as we will keep returning to the question of Sustainability, if the Council accepted the Mayor's proposal as transmitted, it will be very difficult to make a different decision next year to reduce the spending in these areas if it's approved as an ongoing expenditure now.",108,,
579,0.97,5156.117,5166.294,"Put another way, if as proposed, if the Council adopted the budget proposed, absent of another revenue source t will rely on the Jumpstart Fund.",108,,
580,0.97,5166.294,5188.75,I think it's important we are thinking about the future year issues as we are making decisions this year because it will limit resources and choices for use of Jumpstart.,108,,
581,0.97,5188.75,5196.324,I want to make sure to underscore the importance of the investments and the recommendations from the task force.,109,,
582,0.97,5196.324,5197.058,That's not in question.,109,,
583,0.97,5197.058,5202.53,The recommendations that came with the $30 million allotment is not in question.,109,,
584,0.97,5202.53,5216.211,What has been Teed up from central staff the identifying the fund source and identifying the stability in the proposal versus the other investments.,109,,
585,0.97,5216.211,5223.918,We will continue the conversation to make sure we have stability for the jump start priorities and the task force and the ongoing commitments we have made.,109,,
586,0.97,5223.918,5230.258,I think we can do both by making sure there is a more stable funding source.,109,,
587,0.97,5230.258,5232.193,The investments for 2022 are not at risk.,109,,
588,0.97,5232.193,5237.198,The fund source is the biggest question we need to identify.,109,,
589,0.97,5237.198,5242.036,"And to be very clear, I am committed to the $30 million amount.",109,,
590,0.97,5242.036,5257.752,"That doesn't mean carrying other last year's plus another $30 million, I don't think that would set up the community for success to have half of the funding ripped away at the end of the year or half of the projects end.",109,,
591,0.97,5257.752,5263.758,And I think we can do the Both/And approach discussed today.,109,,
592,0.97,5263.758,5265.727,More to come on that piece.,109,,
593,0.97,5265.727,5268.997,The $30 million recommendations from the task force are not in question.,109,,
594,0.97,5268.997,5273.134,The funding source to make sure we can do that in future years is what we're discussing.,109,,
595,0.97,5273.134,5277.238,Great.,109,,
596,0.97,5277.238,5296.924,"So yes, I am going to be looking at how we reflect in this year's budget any of the carry forward dollars that have not been spent in this year so we can get the amount to $30 million and maintain the commitments.",109,,
597,0.97,5296.924,5297.792,Let's continue.,109,,
598,0.97,5297.792,5298.026,Okay.,110,,
599,0.97,5298.026,5313.474,"So this slide folds in the general fund impact of taking the--of implementing the Eci investments, which would be $12.8 million in the general fund.",110,,
600,0.97,5313.474,5329.057,So that changes the running total of the deficit in the general fund from $9 million surplus to a $3.4 million short fall and the $12.75 million for Eci on an ongoing basis.,110,,
601,0.97,5329.057,5337.665,And then if we could look at that slide.,110,,
602,0.97,5337.665,5343.838,"So far, we have talked about the baseline of the budget.",110,,
603,0.97,5343.838,5353.247,"And you know, it triggers a Synapse I missed.",110,,
604,0.97,5353.247,5371.432,"It's important that the particularly with regards to the technical adjustments, adds back in the general fund support for the library and Seattle parks, which had been reduced given the economic circumstances in 2020 and 2021 budgets.",110,,
605,0.97,5371.432,5383.644,"I wanted to point that out that the spending we talked about includes the baseline changes, adding the support for library and parks.",110,,
606,0.97,5383.644,5388.549,Funding deposited in the fiscal reserves.,110,,
607,0.97,5388.549,5390.785,Funding Eci at a $12.8 million from the general fund.,110,,
608,0.97,5390.785,5403.698,"And now, we are going to talk about the remainder of the spending proposed in the general fund budget, which is on the net basis, $62.4 million.",110,,
609,0.97,5403.698,5411.205,It's actually--the total amount of spending proposed is $65.1 million.,110,,
610,0.97,5411.205,5416.21,"However, there is about $1.6 million of new revenue that is tied to some of the new spending.",110,,
611,0.97,5416.21,5432.827,"And then also, there's about $4.5 million of Coronavirus local recovery fund money that is added to the budget to support some economic and new deal investments.",110,,
612,0.97,5432.827,5441.969,And it's important that that money is added using revenue replacement provisions from the America rescue plan act.,110,,
613,0.97,5441.969,5455.016,"We are--just a little bit of history, we were provided through that Federal legislation two different funding totalling $116 million.",110,,
614,0.97,5455.016,5464.759,One of the adjustments that I covered earlier in the presentation was supplement L legislation discussed this year.,110,,
615,0.97,5464.759,5473.868,That was part of the Seattle rescue plan that deployed the first of the Clipper moneys.,110,,
616,0.97,5473.868,5475.369,I'll refer to it that way.,110,,
617,0.97,5475.369,5479.674,It was the first of the Clipper money.,110,,
618,0.97,5479.674,5485.012,We are receiving a second of $116 million of money in 2022.,110,,
619,0.97,5485.012,5491.285,"And it shows up in various places, more so in the jump start Fund.",110,,
620,0.97,5491.285,5496.691,The discussion we will have in a bit.,110,,
621,0.97,5496.691,5503.231,There is about $4.5 million of Clifr money to support the general fund programs in 2022.,110,,
622,0.97,5503.231,5508.102,It's important to point out that the money is one time.,110,,
623,0.97,5508.102,5514.242,We get one installment of $116 million.,110,,
624,0.97,5514.242,5515.142,And the full amount.,110,,
625,0.97,5515.142,5518.546,It's not something we get Unfortunately each and every year.,110,,
626,0.97,5518.546,5521.315,It's important to have that as the economy continues to recover.,110,,
627,0.97,5521.315,5539.467,"One point, it's just important to know it doesn't have necessarily various at this point in the budget is that we could under the Federal guidance use a fuller amount under the basis of revenue replacement.",110,,
628,0.97,5539.467,5555.917,"This is saying if the city's revenues have been impacted by Covid at an amount that means substantial support is needed to support the recovery as those revenue sources recover, you can use a higher amount.",110,,
629,0.97,5555.917,5571.265,"Based on the calculations from the city budget office, in fact, the full $116 million of the Clifr moneys could be going to the revenue replacement.",110,,
630,0.97,5571.265,5573.568,That's not how the budget is built.,110,,
631,0.97,5573.568,5581.475,I'm pointing that out because it provides the flexible use of Council how the funds are deployed in the budget adopted.,110,,
632,0.97,5581.475,5586.147,"Tom, could you repeat the summary message from that?",111,,
633,0.97,5586.147,5590.484,And then I have a question about some of those investments as well.,111,,
634,0.97,5590.618,5594.588,Sure.,112,,
635,0.97,5594.588,5607.234,So I guess the Snapshot is there is $116 million that has not yet been fully deployed from the Traunch two.,112,,
636,0.97,5607.234,5609.27,And the budget Deploys that amount.,112,,
637,0.97,5609.27,5616.377,Some of it is directly spent out of the Clfr fund that has been created.,112,,
638,0.97,5616.377,5620.381,But $4.5 million is going to the general fund.,112,,
639,0.97,5620.381,5632.326,"And $65 million, again, I don't want to give away the punch line, but $65 million used to support on a one-time basis the jump start fund investments.",112,,
640,0.97,5632.326,5642.003,But the key take away is that the full $116 million could be used in a different way.,112,,
641,0.97,5642.003,5648.743,"Most importantly, as revenue replacement, which would provide the utmost of flexibility for how the moneys are used.",112,,
642,0.97,5648.743,5648.876,.,112,,
643,0.97,5648.876,5650.144,Thank you very much.,113,,
644,0.97,5650.144,5652.046,"Colleagues, that's an important note.",113,,
645,0.97,5652.046,5652.88,It's in the memo as well.,113,,
646,0.97,5652.88,5656.617,I wanted to make sure to lift that piece up.,113,,
647,0.97,5656.617,5680.875,Because we saw our good chair of parks wanted to also just confirm here on the memo we talk about how the back fill provision of jump start fund already made sure that we were preventing general fund service cuts when revenues continue to recover slower than anticipated.,113,,
648,0.97,5680.875,5702.329,"So we're providing resources--while we're also providing resources to restore contributions to the Seattle parks and public library so that we can rebuild the fiscal reserves, jump start would have accounted for rebuilding the reductions with made for parks and labors.",113,,
649,0.97,5702.329,5707.902,"There were not cuts, but some of the services during Covid could not happen.",113,,
650,0.97,5707.902,5710.905,We know how important that funding is now.,113,,
651,0.97,5710.905,5715.042,People are wanting to engage and go to community centers and parks and libraries.,113,,
652,0.97,5715.042,5722.416,"The funds from jump start going to parks and public libraries are, a, to restore the previous Covid-Related reductions.",113,,
653,0.97,5722.416,5724.952,"And B, the one time for 2022 only.",113,,
654,0.97,5725.252,5727.455,.,113,,
655,0.97,5732.526,5737.865,So just a few other key points.,114,,
656,0.97,5737.865,5751.779,"Just as an side, the memo includes an attachment that shows by line item all of the components of the $65 million of new spending that is covered by this slide.",114,,
657,0.97,5751.779,5756.717,So Councilmembers of the committee can see where the money is going.,114,,
658,0.97,5756.717,5768.662,I'll highlight two pieces because they have relevance to the prior discussion about the original $100 million proposal from Eci.,114,,
659,0.97,5768.662,5781.142,"In the new budget as ongoing adds our $30 million for budgeting and capacity building, which were one time in 2021 the proposed ongoing in 2022.",114,,
660,0.97,5781.142,5793.12,Those two items alone represent about close to two-thirds of the total new spending covered by this slide.,114,,
661,0.97,5793.12,5810.137,"Just before we go to the next piece, this adjustment, all the spending and revenue adjustments thus far bring the baseline balance to $62.4 million in the general fund.",114,,
662,0.97,5810.137,5811.972,This next slide--.,114,,
663,0.97,5811.972,5813.707,Before you move on.,115,,
664,0.97,5813.707,5813.908,Aly?,115,,
665,0.97,5813.908,5828.088,I want to clarify to make sure we addressed the question you were asking about the general fund putting back the general fund into the parks and other budgets from last year.,116,,
666,0.97,5828.088,5839.934,I think your question was whether--I'm not clear if you were asking whether or not that replenishment of the parks general fund is part of this $62 million.,116,,
667,0.97,5839.934,5850.044,"And I believe, and Tom, correct me if I'm wrong here, there are technical adjustments, sort of baseline adjustments made to the budget.",116,,
668,0.97,5850.044,5862.356,And I believe that the money that was used to restore the general fund contribution to the parks fund is not included in the $62 million?,116,,
669,0.97,5862.356,5863.557,That's correct.,117,,
670,0.97,5863.557,5865.292,That was my oversight.,117,,
671,0.97,5865.292,5877.037,"To go back to the starting slide that was the baseline plus technical adjustments, I failed to mention that that includes the add backs for parks and libraries.",117,,
672,0.97,5877.037,5884.044,So this stage right here included those critical pieces.,117,,
673,0.97,5884.044,5889.116,"Put another way, chairman Mosqueda, the restoration of parks funding is included here.",118,,
674,0.97,5889.116,5903.197,"When we get to this point where the authorized contribution from the general fund is to support Ongoing-Based city services is deposited into the general Fund, that was adequate to restore that funding.",118,,
675,0.97,5903.197,5912.84,"What we are talking about here in this $62 million is new spending, not sort of baseline adjustments.",118,,
676,0.97,5912.84,5927.755,"And as Tom pointed out, the largest items are participate budgets in the community safety capacity building that were provided in the 2021 adopted budget as one-time expenditures.",118,,
677,0.97,5927.755,5937.898,"And this is getting, again, at the point you and director handy raised earlier in the discussions that there are shared priorities included in this new spending.",118,,
678,0.97,5937.898,5949.009,The Council has choices to make about sort of the ongoing source of funds or whether or not to keep these in the budget as ongoing.,118,,
679,0.97,5949.009,5953.013,Or identify an additional revenue source.,118,,
680,0.97,5953.314,5955.783,.,118,,
681,0.97,5963.657,5967.828,So if we can go to the next slide.,119,,
682,0.97,5967.828,5971.966,We'll wrap up the discussion of the general fund.,119,,
683,0.97,5971.966,5978.439,"So as mentioned, the Mayor's budget includes a proposed change to the jump start policy.",119,,
684,0.97,5978.439,5997.057,One key piece of that is that a higher level of support is allowed for the general fund in 2022 also key to note that the policy change would Delete the pending plan for future years.,119,,
685,0.97,5997.057,6007.801,It would be governed by some very broad spending parameters without any of the discrete details by program area in the jump start fund current policy.,119,,
686,0.97,6007.801,6016.243,The additional support from the jump start fund to the general fund is about $62.4 million.,119,,
687,0.97,6016.243,6018.912,That resolves in deficit from the prior slide.,119,,
688,0.97,6018.912,6043.37,"What you see now is in fact the entire general fund revenues and expenditures of $1.587 million, of which $147 million would be transferred in from the jump start versus the $85 million allowed in policy.",119,,
689,0.97,6043.37,6052.746,So it's not to say that jump start fund money is specifically supporting any individual add in the general fund.,119,,
690,0.97,6052.746,6064.124,"Though, the way I would say it is that if not that the additional deposit from the jump start fund to the general fund makes these adds possible.",119,,
691,0.97,6064.124,6087.548,So that leads us into some of the issues that we have already identified and started the discussion about the proposed policy change to the jump start Fund and the implications for both the jump start Fund and the general fund this year and in future years.,119,,
692,0.97,6087.548,6113.106,"Just to state, issue one, due to ongoing budget proposals in 2022, it requires $148 million of the jump start fund balance, $62.3 million higher than the amount allowed which reduces the capacity of the jump start fund to fund the programs as specified in the spending plan by a like amount in 2023 and beyond.",119,,
693,0.97,6113.106,6118.378,I'm going to pause you real quick before the issue identification in detail here.,120,,
694,0.97,6118.378,6138.365,"Colleagues, before issue identification, as you all take a look at the pages that have been reviewed by Tom in the memo, are there any questions before we go to issue identification?",120,,
695,0.97,6138.365,6138.565,Okay.,120,,
696,0.97,6138.565,6140.934,"Tom, I think everyone is well briefed.",120,,
697,0.97,6140.934,6141.301,Please continue.,120,,
698,0.97,6141.435,6145.506,Okay.,121,,
699,0.97,6145.506,6148.175,So some options to consider for that issue.,121,,
700,0.97,6148.175,6155.949,One is to reduce spending in the 2022 proposed budget and reduce the transfer from the jump start Fund by the single amount.,121,,
701,0.97,6155.949,6163.991,And Reallocate the resources from within the jump start fund in the 2022 budget for purposes in the fund policy.,121,,
702,0.97,6163.991,6182.075,"A second option would be to change some amount of the general fund budget as ongoing and switch them to one time in 2022, which assume alliance on the jump start Fund after 2022.",121,,
703,0.97,6182.075,6195.689,"It should be noted that adds that are ongoing in nature, those that establish investments in new programs and hire new staff in particular may not be workable as the one-time investments.",121,,
704,0.97,6195.689,6200.961,That's something to consider in switching things from ongoing to one time.,121,,
705,0.97,6200.961,6207.134,"Next, this kind of goes to the conversation earlier about revenue Sourcing.",121,,
706,0.97,6207.134,6223.917,An option is to identify a new revenue source to support all of some of the new generally fund budget adds and budget for jump start purposes.,121,,
707,0.97,6223.917,6226.186,And it's viable to consider no action for this.,121,,
708,0.97,6226.186,6226.853,Thank you again.,122,,
709,0.97,6226.853,6239.399,"I know this will be one of the biggest issues we address going Forwardment colleagues, I want to make space for folks to ask questions and weigh in with ideas.",122,,
710,0.97,6239.399,6259.853,"On the first issue identification, the ways in which we can support the areas with shared priorities, for example, in the equitable community task force and budgeting, for example, it is important for us to make sure that the city is able to maintain the jump start coalition spend plan.",122,,
711,0.97,6259.853,6273.0,"It was unanimously passed by this Council, specifically to address the specific economic conditions and supporting our city small businesses and tourist sector.",122,,
712,0.97,6273.0,6277.537,"We invested in housing, green new deal investments, economic resilience.",122,,
713,0.97,6277.537,6285.045,Those are important and have direct crossover with the Bipoc investment.,122,,
714,0.97,6285.045,6292.686,I want to maintain the commitment of $30 million for the budgets and the equitable task force.,122,,
715,0.97,6292.686,6305.065,"Having the $30 million reflected in the budget and using the dollars unspent, there's an interest in helping to identify the ongoing sources of revenue in future years.",122,,
716,0.97,6305.065,6311.938,Having a directive or conversation through policy conversations in 2022 to make sure that there's stable revenue going forward.,122,,
717,0.97,6311.938,6321.014,We can do that by also changing the fund source as Tom talked about to identify one-time revenue sources to keep the investments at $30 million each.,122,,
718,0.97,6321.014,6328.789,And then work to create more stable revenue streams going forward.,122,,
719,0.97,6328.789,6340.067,"In a way, that's a combination of option one and future work and collaborative work on identifying a revenue source going forward outlined in option C.",122,,
720,0.97,6340.067,6340.3,A and C.,122,,
721,0.97,6340.3,6365.726,But know that there is still a huge amount of commitment to the task force recommendations and budgeting and keeping it at $30 million and not putting it a cliff in the future or cuts in area.,122,,
722,0.97,6365.726,6373.6,And we have some good ways in which we can keep the commitments and identify fund sources in the future if we look at one-time funding.,122,,
723,0.97,6373.6,6377.738,More to come from me on that.,122,,
724,0.97,6377.738,6380.841,I wanted to signal my interest in a and C.,122,,
725,0.97,6381.141,6386.38,Okay.,122,,
726,0.97,6388.115,6399.96,"Sorry, the second issue that central staff analysis identified with regard to fiscal reserves.",123,,
727,0.97,6399.96,6408.301,The prior discussion about the proposed balance levels and how they contrast with the current policy.,123,,
728,0.97,6408.301,6418.145,Proposed fiscal Reserve policy change would bring the 2022 ending reserves to $15.6 million lower than required by the current policy.,123,,
729,0.97,6418.145,6424.451,And would provide four additional years to replenish the reserves.,123,,
730,0.97,6424.451,6432.426,So the options for this--some options to address that issue would be to reject the proposed fiscal policy change.,123,,
731,0.97,6432.426,6447.707,And identify an additional $15 million from within the budget through any combination of reductions or new revenues to add an additional $56 million to reserves in 2022.,123,,
732,0.97,6447.707,6458.018,Or the Council could revise the policy to allow for a shorter or longer payment--group payment period for the emergency Fund.,123,,
733,0.97,6458.018,6460.42,"And then Finally, no action is also an option.",123,,
734,0.97,6460.554,6464.558,"Thank you, Tom.",124,,
735,0.97,6464.558,6465.358,Any comments or questions on this?,124,,
736,0.97,6465.358,6468.261,Okay.,124,,
737,0.97,6468.261,6489.916,Some of the comments that we talked about earlier note that the decisions about where to place the additional $25 million in our emergency Fund and our revenue stabilization Fund are some policy choices that were made.,124,,
738,0.97,6489.916,6506.466,"For me, I am interested in hearing more about the revenue forecast forth coming in early November and hearing about the priorities that Councilmembers may be identifying in the next week or so before we choose an option specific to this.",124,,
739,0.97,6506.466,6524.718,Some of that I think we will be--we will need to remain a little bit flexible before the budget is finalized to see how the priorities and the future revenue forecast factor in to the level with the investments made in the stabilization fund.,124,,
740,0.97,6524.718,6540.834,"Appreciate the note that the jump start progressive proposal not only included funding for the priorities we identified in the spend plan, but included the flexibility to build back the reserves and make sure that investments for made in, for example, marks and Booibs.",124,,
741,0.97,6540.834,6557.717,And the question is how do the priorities that you will identify in the next few weeks Aline with additional revenue changes that we see from the revenue forecast Council and priorities that you all have with how the items are shifted around in the proposed budget year.,124,,
742,0.97,6557.717,6560.654,I don't have a specific recommendation for options today.,124,,
743,0.97,6560.654,6570.697,It will be dependent on the conversations over the next few weeks in the revenue forecast.,124,,
744,0.97,6570.697,6575.068,So the--there's a third issue that is identified.,125,,
745,0.97,6575.068,6577.07,This is in the general fund.,125,,
746,0.97,6577.07,6585.011,This regards the equitable community initiative support from new revenue.,125,,
747,0.97,6585.011,6592.586,The Mayor's proposed budget included $30 million for ongoing investments but not a new revenue source to support them.,125,,
748,0.97,6592.586,6600.694,The options include change the appropriations to one time and engage the Eci task force to identify the ongoing progressive revenue source.,125,,
749,0.97,6600.694,6621.448,"Reduce some or all of the appropriations in 2022, recognizing that much of the appropriations for the Eci recommendations will carry forward in the 2022 and Eci task force to identify a progressive revenue source for the ongoing basis in 2023 and beyond.",125,,
750,0.97,6621.448,6624.985,"And then again, no action is an option.",125,,
751,0.97,6625.118,6633.893,"Colleagues, any thoughts or reflections?",126,,
752,0.97,6633.893,6634.361,Councilmember Juarez?,126,,
753,0.97,6634.361,6647.507,"Didn't the Mayor, didn't we get a revision from Dr. noble, a modification on a that doesn't read the same as your memo?",127,,
754,0.97,6647.507,6649.376,At least I got that E-mail.,127,,
755,0.97,6649.376,6655.482,You may have access from your task force participation that you can inform us about.,128,,
756,0.97,6655.482,6660.02,I'm seeing Councilmember--thank you for flagging that.,128,,
757,0.97,6660.02,6663.857,I'm seeing Aly come on is screen.,128,,
758,0.97,6663.857,6667.327,"If you have updates, we're happy to receive those.",128,,
759,0.97,6667.327,6669.829,I have not heard updates.,129,,
760,0.97,6669.829,6675.668,We have not received any response from the budget office on this memo.,130,,
761,0.97,6675.668,6675.935,Okay.,131,,
762,0.97,6675.935,6686.746,"You know what, I got an E-mail this morning from the executive or from my staff saying go to page 18.",131,,
763,0.97,6686.746,6687.914,A has been modified.,131,,
764,0.97,6687.914,6688.615,Here's the modification.,131,,
765,0.97,6688.615,6690.183,Maybe I'm special.,131,,
766,0.97,6690.183,6690.517,I don't know.,131,,
767,0.97,6690.517,6690.917,Double check here.,131,,
768,0.97,6690.917,6697.057,"The E-mail was from--Oh, the E-mail was from my staff.",131,,
769,0.97,6697.057,6698.792,Apparently it was changed.,131,,
770,0.97,6698.792,6700.56,Maybe I'm wrong on this.,131,,
771,0.97,6700.56,6702.762,I apologize if I spoke incorrectly.,131,,
772,0.97,6702.762,6711.771,I would just note that these issues and options and the analysis in the memos is not the work of the budget office.,132,,
773,0.97,6711.771,6719.345,"They may have shared a different perspective, but--or we may have modified it.",132,,
774,0.97,6719.345,6729.122,"I'm not sure what the modification you're referring to, but this work would not reflect other options that other executive staff may have identified.",132,,
775,0.97,6729.122,6747.307,But I think that this is the perfect opportunity for staff in our offices and the conversations that we are able to have here today with Councilmembers to identify potential modifications to some of the options outlined in the presentation from central staff.,133,,
776,0.97,6747.307,6749.242,These are some examples of options.,133,,
777,0.97,6749.242,6753.747,Your team may have been doing great work thinking about how to modify option a.,133,,
778,0.97,6753.747,6755.882,And I am all ears on that.,133,,
779,0.97,6755.882,6759.752,I have a similar modification to offer for B.,133,,
780,0.97,6759.752,6764.224,"So if you have want to share any of that, of course, you're welcome to.",133,,
781,0.97,6764.224,6776.302,"If you need extra time to think through the modification, this is exactly the opportunity for us to flag, Hey, I may have a modification on a, and we'll come back at a later date.",133,,
782,0.97,6776.302,6777.303,That's no problem.,133,,
783,0.97,6777.303,6778.004,Okay.,134,,
784,0.97,6778.004,6778.471,I double checked this.,134,,
785,0.97,6778.471,6781.107,"And I can filibuster for you, if you would like.",134,,
786,0.97,6781.241,6785.178,Okay.,135,,
787,0.97,6785.178,6785.411,Yeah.,135,,
788,0.97,6785.411,6785.979,I am correct.,135,,
789,0.97,6785.979,6788.681,I'll get back to you.,135,,
790,0.97,6788.681,6788.948,I promise.,135,,
791,0.97,6788.948,6789.282,No worries.,136,,
792,0.97,6789.415,6791.05,Thank you.,137,,
793,0.97,6791.05,6791.618,No worries.,138,,
794,0.97,6791.618,6791.918,Thank you.,138,,
795,0.97,6791.918,6794.654,Because I think this is exactly what this is for.,138,,
796,0.97,6794.654,6799.792,"If your staff have ideas on how to modify option a, that's fantastic.",138,,
797,0.97,6799.792,6803.963,We need all ideas on the table at this point in Prepping the budget.,138,,
798,0.97,6803.963,6812.672,"I would offer this in terms of equitable communities initiative continuing ongoing support, making sure we're reflecting $30 million.",138,,
799,0.97,6812.672,6814.24,I'm leaning forward B as listed on this chart here.,138,,
800,0.97,6814.24,6825.585,I think that we can maintain our commitment at $30 million recognizing that there is significant amount of funding allocated in this year's budget up to $30 million.,138,,
801,0.97,6825.585,6829.422,A large portion of that has not yet been spent.,138,,
802,0.97,6829.422,6836.763,"So I am very interested in carrying forward into 2022, as we have already authorized, any of that unspent money.",138,,
803,0.97,6836.763,6848.408,"And to true up the amount, if you will, to make sure that we're maintaining a $30 million investment to continue those priorities.",138,,
804,0.97,6848.408,6864.858,And I say continue because I do believe we can in future years in 2023 and beyond identify investment resource so that there is stable funding for that so there's no conflict with other progressive revenue sources.,138,,
805,0.97,6864.858,6869.128,"That allows for us, a, to maintain the jump start investments.",138,,
806,0.97,6869.128,6873.733,"B, to maintain the investment and recommendations from the task force.",138,,
807,0.97,6873.733,6882.642,"And C, to make sure that we're utilizing the unspent dollars in 2021 in 2022 and Trueing up any difference.",138,,
808,0.97,6882.642,6886.679,So that is what I will be looking forward to working with you on.,138,,
809,0.97,6886.679,6892.285,And the difference is what would be reflected in the budget to keep them at $30 million.,138,,
810,0.97,6892.285,6895.655,Appreciate this issue has been discussed so in depth this year.,138,,
811,0.97,6895.655,6899.325,"One of--this year, today.",138,,
812,0.97,6899.325,6906.899,One of the things still to be identified is the true amount of unspent dollars by the end of 2021.,138,,
813,0.97,6906.899,6916.309,We'll be doing analysis on that to see if we can accurately reflect that in the budget so that $30 million is maintained.,138,,
814,0.97,6916.309,6920.146,Additional comments or questions on that?,138,,
815,0.97,6920.146,6920.346,Okay.,138,,
816,0.97,6920.346,6925.084,Early signalling on what we're doing in my office in terms of thinking about how to main tan the $30 million.,138,,
817,0.97,6925.084,6928.855,All right.,138,,
818,0.97,6928.855,6929.289,"Let's continue, Tom.",138,,
819,0.97,6929.422,6932.692,Okay.,139,,
820,0.97,6932.692,6934.06,Thank you.,139,,
821,0.97,6934.06,6945.305,"So to just Calibrate with where we are in the more detailed memo, this now we're jumping into the discussion about the jump start spending plan.",139,,
822,0.97,6945.305,6954.647,It's section four of the memo that begins on page 16.,139,,
823,0.97,6954.647,6974.634,"This table in essence Encapsulates the jump start policies in the ordinance would seek for different spending categories in the ordinance, including the general fund transfer amounts allowed for administration, housing, equitable development initiative, economic revitalization, and the green new deal.",139,,
824,0.97,6974.634,6978.137,"And it compares in the second column, moving to the right.",139,,
825,0.97,6978.137,6982.475,Those amounts from the jump start fund proposed in the budget and shows the differences.,139,,
826,0.97,6982.475,6992.318,So there are a few things to highlight within this table.,139,,
827,0.97,6992.318,7006.866,"First and foremost, and we have touched on it in earlier slides is that the budget relies on $147 million deposit in the general fund as opposed to the $85 million allowed in the policy.",139,,
828,0.97,7006.866,7016.709,The jump start fund is supporting the general fund to the tune of $62 million more that would be envisioned in the policy ordinance.,139,,
829,0.97,7016.709,7020.747,The administration piece is slightly different.,139,,
830,0.97,7020.747,7036.829,"And I'll just stop for a second and explain that the original jump start fund ordinance allowed for 5% of total jump start fund resources to go toward administration, which is on the order of $7 million.",139,,
831,0.97,7036.829,7056.649,"The proposed budget and the way I have shown the spending plan here, instead of showing administration as its own discrete amount, in fact, Overlays the spending categories, which is a more accurate way in the piece.",139,,
832,0.97,7056.649,7076.369,"What remains in the administrative line is just the total $7 million allowed for administration after reflecting that a lot of the administrative costs are included in other categories such as housing, Edi and green new deal.",139,,
833,0.97,7076.369,7082.708,"So just with that side note, moving to housing, you will see--.",139,,
834,0.97,7082.708,7086.446,Can you pause real quick?,140,,
835,0.97,7086.446,7086.712,I'm sorry.,140,,
836,0.97,7086.712,7090.65,"Councilmember Sawant, did you have a question?",140,,
837,0.97,7090.65,7091.451,I do.,141,,
838,0.97,7091.451,7092.685,It's on this slide.,141,,
839,0.97,7092.685,7093.019,No problem.,142,,
840,0.97,7093.019,7093.252,Thanks.,142,,
841,0.97,7093.252,7096.088,"Please go ahead, Tom.",142,,
842,0.97,7096.088,7097.99,"Thank you, Madame chair.",143,,
843,0.97,7097.99,7114.04,"So as this shows, the investment from the jump start fund for housing is $52.4 million lower than what's envisioned in the jump start fund ordinance.",143,,
844,0.97,7114.04,7116.175,"Similarly, the economical revitalization is receiving fewer funds.",143,,
845,0.97,7116.175,7124.717,"And green new deal is about $800,000 short of what would be contemplated in the ordinance for jump start Fund.",143,,
846,0.97,7124.717,7139.365,"And then also, at the bottom of the table, there is about $3.7 million, which is mostly shown in the proposed budget and in the way the executive attempts to demonstrate compliance where jump start from the policies.",143,,
847,0.97,7139.365,7153.479,There's $3.7 million for homeless--for services aiding people experiencing homelessness that are not actually part of the allowed spending for the jump start Fund.,143,,
848,0.97,7153.479,7156.149,In is this year and future years.,143,,
849,0.97,7156.149,7164.891,"So you have, Luke me, heard that the proposed budget meets the spirit of the jump start Fund.",143,,
850,0.97,7164.891,7173.065,The next slide will show how that is achieved within the proposed budget.,143,,
851,0.97,7173.065,7178.971,Given the one-time quicker moneys.,143,,
852,0.97,7178.971,7179.238,Great.,144,,
853,0.97,7179.238,7185.645,"Councilmember Sawant, did you want to wait until the next slide or ask your question now?",144,,
854,0.97,7185.645,7186.112,Yeah.,145,,
855,0.97,7186.112,7188.981,It might make sense to ask right now.,145,,
856,0.97,7189.115,7191.984,Please go ahead.,146,,
857,0.97,7192.118,7198.491,So I just wanted to make sure I understand this slide accurately.,147,,
858,0.97,7198.491,7219.979,"There's no column in the table that shows, and this is slide 21 I'm referring to, there's no column if the table that shows how the payroll tax, the big business tax revenues, should be available for housing and the green new deal based on the plan the Council approved when the tax was approved last year.",147,,
859,0.97,7219.979,7226.118,That's one thing that I wanted to inform.,147,,
860,0.97,7226.118,7235.494,"That spending plan had 62% of all the big business tax revenues going to housing, which would be over $145 million in 2022.",147,,
861,0.97,7235.494,7239.732,And $21 million going to green new deal investments.,147,,
862,0.97,7239.732,7244.77,"But as I said, I don't see there is a column with those figures on this table.",147,,
863,0.97,7244.77,7260.987,"Instead, the first column of this table shows how they would be distributed if $85 million of the funds are used to prevent budget cuts as recommended by the ordinance sponsored over the summer.",147,,
864,0.97,7260.987,7272.798,The table showed that the Mayor's proposed budget is using the tax funds to back fill the funds as proposed by the Council bill over the summer.,147,,
865,0.97,7272.798,7279.872,But both options use more to back the general fund deficits than was recommended by the initial spending plan.,147,,
866,0.97,7279.872,7283.643,We have to repeat all of those things clear.,147,,
867,0.97,7283.643,7287.58,"First, I want to confirm that my understanding is accurate.",147,,
868,0.97,7287.58,7303.929,And I wanted to raise that there is of course another option and we should refrain from thinking about raising progressive revenues as something that needs more ideas to come to the floor.,147,,
869,0.97,7303.929,7305.898,It's clear that what we need to do.,147,,
870,0.97,7305.898,7312.171,We want to prevent the budget cuts in the departments with necessary social functions.,147,,
871,0.97,7312.171,7330.056,"I'm says it that way because the bloated police budget are different than the needs to make sure that there are no cuts in other departments, departments that serve Renters or marginalized communities or utilities.",147,,
872,0.97,7330.056,7334.427,All of that is necessary.,147,,
873,0.97,7334.427,7338.03,And we have to prevent any budget cuts.,147,,
874,0.97,7338.03,7340.966,It's crucial that the--for the last year.,147,,
875,0.97,7340.966,7345.137,"And has been noted by others, the big business tax is what has held the budget afloat.",147,,
876,0.97,7345.137,7367.76,And we at the same time have to prevent the--some of the undermining of the original spending plan that the Council had approved and to make sure that the intent is fully funded.,147,,
877,0.97,7367.76,7369.962,And that mandate is fully funded.,147,,
878,0.97,7369.962,7377.069,I wanted to say there's no mistake around how that can be done.,147,,
879,0.97,7377.069,7377.403,It's obvious.,147,,
880,0.97,7377.403,7408.834,"And the tax already exists in the law books to--and so I just wanted to remind members of the public who are watching that a bill to do just that, which is increase the tax rate--and we're talking about the largest and most profitable corporations, that a bill to increase the tax rate, do just that, did come from my office.",147,,
881,0.97,7408.834,7413.139,And it was referred to the budget committee last November.,147,,
882,0.97,7413.139,7418.544,And it was something that I tried to bring forward in the budget deliberations last fall.,147,,
883,0.97,7418.544,7426.485,And I want to indicate that I intend to propose that again in this year's budget deliberations.,147,,
884,0.97,7426.485,7440.866,"And it does--and Needless to say figure in the list of proposed ideas for budget amendments I sent out yesterday, my staff sent out to the Councilmembers and the chair to look at when we talk about the amendments.",147,,
885,0.97,7440.866,7441.133,Thank you.,147,,
886,0.97,7441.133,7441.467,Thank you.,148,,
887,0.97,7441.467,7444.136,I want to jump in real quick.,148,,
888,0.97,7444.136,7451.544,I think there is an important distinction in the first line regarding general fund.,148,,
889,0.97,7451.544,7466.025,I think that the expenses that we anticipated coming down with the proposed budget as Tom outlined in the first few slides were to the tune of about $50 million.,148,,
890,0.97,7466.025,7475.267,It was policy decisions and choices in the proposed budget that brings the number from $50 million to $85 million.,148,,
891,0.97,7475.267,7492.184,We're allowing for jump start to make sure there wasn't austerity cuts due to lower than anticipated revenue as we recover from the crisis helps to make sure we're not engaging in AUS Terty budgets and trying to find $50 million worth of cuts.,148,,
892,0.97,7492.184,7517.476,"To that point, jump start, like it did in the first two years, helped to prevent the deep cuts to public services, especially in making sure that the good living wage jobs were provided in the moment of crisis so that the most vulnerable could have access to services in community housing and other vulnerable services like making sure folks had access to a shelter, showers, and food services.",148,,
893,0.97,7517.476,7522.414,"So I do think that the line for general Fund, thank you for showing that.",148,,
894,0.97,7522.414,7523.015,And I'll stop there.,148,,
895,0.97,7523.015,7526.085,If you have more to add about the $50 million.,148,,
896,0.97,7526.085,7533.926,And I have one more comment that emphasizes one of the points that Councilmember Sawant brought up.,148,,
897,0.97,7533.926,7534.56,It raised an important question.,148,,
898,0.97,7534.693,7544.036,"So to the question on the $50 million versus the $85 million that was shown on the last table, and I'll flip back in a minute.",149,,
899,0.97,7544.036,7547.74,I don't want to do too much flipping.,149,,
900,0.97,7547.74,7550.976,It gets confusing on the screen.,149,,
901,0.97,7550.976,7561.754,This $50 million is looking at base general fund resources on the current revenue forecast and base expenditures we want anticipate to maintain the base city services.,149,,
902,0.97,7561.754,7572.731,"That's the amount of money after the budget office goes through the exercise of adjusting all ongoing services for any annual increases, that sort of thing.",149,,
903,0.97,7572.731,7580.472,And backing out any one-time expenditures included in the 2021 adopted budget.,149,,
904,0.97,7580.472,7584.543,Then you go to the contribution into the emergency reserves.,149,,
905,0.97,7584.543,7597.523,"In order to to be consistent with current policy or proposed policy, one could argue whether or not this is or isn't a baseline expenditure.",149,,
906,0.97,7597.523,7616.942,One could argue that the executive needed at least $75 million of jump start revenue to present a budget and really to be consistent if she was to present a budget that was consistent with the current policies for the emergency fund probably would have used all of the $85 million.,149,,
907,0.97,7616.942,7628.287,So the important thing to note is the jump start policies that were adopted this year did allow for $85 million to be deposited into the general fund.,149,,
908,0.97,7628.287,7638.097,And there wasn't a nuance to say that--and that was a calculation of Prepandemic forecasts to country general fun forecasts.,149,,
909,0.97,7638.097,7647.039,"And there wasn't a, if you don't need it all, you put the other money back in the jump start Fund.",149,,
910,0.97,7647.039,7657.783,So using about $85 million or $86 million of jump start is consistent with the policy direction from the Council.,149,,
911,0.97,7657.783,7664.523,"And then quickly, I'll NOTE in response to Councilmember Sawant's question, she is correct.",149,,
912,0.97,7664.523,7667.426,We are not presenting the spending plan as it was adopted.,149,,
913,0.97,7667.426,7668.394,That's not current law.,149,,
914,0.97,7668.394,7679.071,"Based on the current adopted policy in the city of Seattle, this is what we would expect to see in the proposed budget to be Compliant with current policies.",149,,
915,0.97,7679.071,7693.218,"And then what we're pointing out is that the proposed budget isn't consistent even with that adjusted policy and requires a change to the jump start fund policies, should you accept the proposal.",149,,
916,0.97,7693.352,7703.529,And what remains constant is the percentage allocation into the spend categories.,150,,
917,0.97,7703.529,7722.347,"So the percentage allocation for affordable housing, green new deal, Xik resilience, equitable development initiative, all of those percentages remain whole with the intent to say if we needed flexibility from the crisis, we would ward off against austerity budgeting.",150,,
918,0.97,7722.347,7729.888,"I want to underscore a policy choice that the Mayor made in the way in which jump start is used, not adhering to the spend plan.",150,,
919,0.97,7729.888,7735.394,And the point was made about the allocation specific in housing.,150,,
920,0.97,7735.394,7746.839,Jump start spend plan had always and continues to maintain a requirement that two-thirds of the funding from jump start goes into building affordable housing.,150,,
921,0.97,7746.839,7750.642,To address the most pressing crisis in our city.,150,,
922,0.97,7750.642,7760.018,What we see instead with the proposal is two-thirds of the jump start funding going to other investments.,150,,
923,0.97,7760.018,7764.656,Some of that for the revenue stabilization for the $50 million.,150,,
924,0.97,7764.656,7771.797,And some is going in for the closing of the gap for some policy decisions that were made.,150,,
925,0.97,7771.797,7776.201,"But instead of two-thirds going to housing, two-thirds going to other uses.",150,,
926,0.97,7776.201,7780.205,I think that's the big policy question in front of us.,150,,
927,0.97,7780.205,7787.112,And you outline that well on page 17 in your memo as well.,150,,
928,0.97,7787.112,7788.78,"Councilmember Sawant, please go ahead.",150,,
929,0.97,7788.78,7792.351,I just wanted us to be clear about the numbers.,151,,
930,0.97,7792.351,7796.255,We are talking about different numbers.,151,,
931,0.97,7796.255,7801.66,The first digits are not the same.,151,,
932,0.97,7801.66,7802.227,$85 million was subtracted.,151,,
933,0.97,7802.227,7805.797,62% of what was left.,151,,
934,0.97,7805.797,7812.104,That is not the 62% that was originally intended.,151,,
935,0.97,7812.404,7817.442,.,151,,
936,0.97,7817.743,7817.91,Yeah.,152,,
937,0.97,7817.91,7824.716,L I will acknowledge there was a change in the original spend plan.,152,,
938,0.97,7824.716,7833.892,And I want to confirm the points Councilmember Sawant was making in terms of options to identify additional revenue or new revenue.,152,,
939,0.97,7833.892,7842.134,And just confirming that there is the option of a new revenue source as Councilmember Sawant noted.,152,,
940,0.97,7842.134,7857.549,There's the option of mode identifying the existing rates of the revenue sources to increase the amount of the revenue as well as reductions to other city spending to free up the funds to support the other priorities.,152,,
941,0.97,7857.549,7858.183,I wanted to acknowledge that.,152,,
942,0.97,7858.183,7873.599,No disagreement on the sort of range of options available and that there was a bill prepared last year at the request of Councilmember Sawant to adjust the rate of the payroll tax to increase the amount of revenue anticipated.,152,,
943,0.97,7873.599,7900.359,"I think there is a lot of agreement--well, I will own there's agreement between a lot of us on Council that there is a need for additional revenue to respond to the growing need, for example, from the study that says that we need somewhere between $400 to a billion dollars in the region to address affordable housing.",153,,
944,0.97,7900.359,7908.467,The steps we took for the revenue following the lead of the community is to show that the city is trying to take action.,153,,
945,0.97,7908.467,7914.506,And we will continue to work to address the needed funds in affordable housing.,153,,
946,0.97,7914.506,7919.077,And the amount coming in from jump start will continue to go up year over year.,153,,
947,0.97,7919.077,7923.916,"For example, we saw $214 million was the anticipated amount for this year.",153,,
948,0.97,7923.916,7924.583,We're at $235 million actually.,153,,
949,0.97,7924.583,7936.695,"And so as we see greater stability in revenue that comes in the door, it will not be $50 million going to create stability for the revenue sources.",153,,
950,0.97,7936.695,7943.135,And the full percentage that we anticipate for the allotments will go to place.,153,,
951,0.97,7943.135,7953.145,62% of what we anticipated going to affordable housing should have been around $136 million and slightly upwards of that.,153,,
952,0.97,7953.145,7958.884,"And that alone, obviously, is not enough.",153,,
953,0.97,7958.884,7959.952,More work to come here.,153,,
954,0.97,7959.952,7970.529,But $136 million even scaled down to 97 in terms of the expectation for this year was an important marker to be able to build affordable housing.,153,,
955,0.97,7970.529,7986.979,"My concern, and I'll put it out there related to not having all of the jump start funding going to affordable housing right now is when we use Federal dollars and it's one time in nature, we create a cliff for the dollars in future years.",153,,
956,0.97,7986.979,8003.795,"Affordable housing development folks especially coming from the Bipoc community trying to build the affordable housing for the communities at risk of displacement, if we don't have the full amount, that creates the unpredictability for the housing.",153,,
957,0.97,8003.795,8020.178,And part of the interest is flagging changing the fund source so that we don't have $52 million coming from a one-time investment from the Feds when what we need to show is year over year and increases.,153,,
958,0.97,8020.178,8040.665,"When we have half of the amount of money going to affordable housing from a one-time source that goes away at the end of next year, that does not create the stability we need to show stability year other year so that people know that the state is a stable financial source for building the affordable housing.",153,,
959,0.97,8040.665,8060.118,That's something I'll continue to look at is a way for us to write--right that fund source so that the color of money going to affordable housing is consistent and shows predictability year over year.,153,,
960,0.97,8060.118,8065.424,"Chair Mosqueda, can I quickly complete my question?",154,,
961,0.97,8065.424,8065.724,"Oh, yes.",155,,
962,0.97,8065.724,8066.324,Sorry.,155,,
963,0.97,8066.324,8067.759,Did I interrupt you?,155,,
964,0.97,8067.759,8068.093,Not at all.,156,,
965,0.97,8068.093,8072.798,Just to make sure that all my questions got responses.,156,,
966,0.97,8072.798,8090.949,"I know one of the--part of what I asked, and Aly, if you can confirm this, the numbers that $125 million for housing and $21 million for green new deal, the original plan was followed.",156,,
967,0.97,8090.949,8093.118,If the you can confirm that.,156,,
968,0.97,8093.118,8114.706,"And just on the point, chair Mosqueda, I agree we cannot have social housing and green new deal projects which are absolutely essential and critical for our communities, for those to be dependent on the one-time funds.",156,,
969,0.97,8114.706,8119.878,And the Mayor's proposed budget has the large housing budget because of the Federal funds.,156,,
970,0.97,8119.878,8124.015,We need annual funds that have to come from the big businesses and the wealthy.,156,,
971,0.97,8124.015,8131.756,And it is important that the Council pass this tax.,156,,
972,0.97,8131.756,8147.539,And I am happy to hear the comments that we made about how this is what the council as a whole is thinking about.,156,,
973,0.97,8147.539,8156.715,I hope that when I many office brings the amendment forward that we do increase the tax rate.,156,,
974,0.97,8156.715,8167.592,"That is a viable Avenue for us to make sure that we don't Rob Peter to pay Paul, as you were saying.",156,,
975,0.97,8167.592,8180.672,"I agree with the numbers based on the original spend plan and the revenue projected, those numbers are correct, about $21 million.",157,,
976,0.97,8180.672,8181.339,About $136 million for housing.,157,,
977,0.97,8181.339,8190.849,And that would be about the amount we would have expected this year had general fund revenues rebounded.,157,,
978,0.97,8190.849,8191.55,So agree with those calculations.,157,,
979,0.97,8191.85,8196.321,.,157,,
980,0.97,8196.621,8199.324,Thank you for Toggling between the slides there.,158,,
981,0.97,8199.324,8200.959,And we're going to let you continue.,158,,
982,0.97,8201.092,8210.669,"Thank you, Madame chair.",159,,
983,0.97,8210.669,8217.742,This slide is a helpful for the context of the discussion between committee members.,159,,
984,0.97,8217.742,8232.891,It does show indeed the amount of one-time Federal flicker money that's deployed in the Mayor's proposed budget for jump start spending plan purposes.,159,,
985,0.97,8232.891,8234.659,About $15.5 million housing.,159,,
986,0.97,8234.659,8238.43,And $1 million to the investments.,159,,
987,0.97,8238.43,8251.543,So this is the 2022 proposed budget look for how jump start priorities can be met or are met using a mix of ongoing and one-time resources.,159,,
988,0.97,8251.543,8258.817,And the prior slide is a sneak Peek of 2023 and beyond.,159,,
989,0.97,8258.817,8265.09,Understanding there will hopefully be a higher level of recovery in the general fund leading to a reduced amount.,159,,
990,0.97,8265.09,8276.668,It would show the short FALLS in the various spending plan categories that are just propped up on a one-time basis from the Federal funds this year.,159,,
991,0.97,8276.668,8277.269,"Or next year, I should say.",159,,
992,0.97,8277.402,8298.256,"I will add on this slide, this presentation reflects what the director and others from the executive have presented as how the proposed budget meets the intent of the jump start spending plan in term offense the amount of total dollars going to the categories.",160,,
993,0.97,8298.256,8324.749,"This table is slightly different in that it represents central staff sort of slight different take on that, which is to say included in the--it was $3.7 million proposed to be spent on homeless services and mental health services that are not found anywhere in the spend policy.",160,,
994,0.97,8324.749,8335.46,We sort of included that number but have dropped it below the line to reflect that that would not be a consistent spending area based on current policy.,160,,
995,0.97,8335.46,8338.029,Thank you very much.,161,,
996,0.97,8338.029,8341.099,I think that the slide is illuminating.,161,,
997,0.97,8341.099,8350.275,To the earlier conversation we had about the concern about which source of revenue the going forward investments.,161,,
998,0.97,8350.275,8378.47,"For example, with $50 million coming from the Federal Covid relief funds $13.5 million for economic revitalization from Covid relief funds, and $1 million going to the priorities for green new deal from Covid relief Fund, it seems like the total of $65 million would mean that when those one-time funds go away, they would not be built into next year's budget.",161,,
999,0.97,8378.47,8396.921,"Is that a valid take away and concern from your memo that by swapping the use of jump start for the one-time Federal investments, we risk that in future years, it would create the reduction of jump start investments to the tune of $65 million.",161,,
1000,0.97,8397.055,8400.859,Yes.,162,,
1001,0.97,8400.859,8403.962,That is accurate.,162,,
1002,0.97,8403.962,8412.804,"And more so than risk, it replaces the spending lines going forward in the base budgets in the future.",162,,
1003,0.97,8412.804,8425.717,"In 2023 and beyond, there would be $65.5 million less for jump start fund purposes than originally would be required in the jump start.",162,,
1004,0.97,8425.717,8428.686,Because of the use of one-time funds.,162,,
1005,0.97,8428.686,8430.588,Thank you for that clarification.,163,,
1006,0.97,8430.588,8443.001,"For me, this is an important point for us to Ruminate on as we develop our proposed budget as a Council.",163,,
1007,0.97,8443.001,8451.176,The question is broader than for the one time can we meet the spirit of jump start.,163,,
1008,0.97,8451.176,8457.949,The consequence of that is not built in base Bunlts going forward.,163,,
1009,0.97,8457.949,8460.685,Especially the affordable housing request.,163,,
1010,0.97,8460.685,8466.891,There was a large contingent of those who asked for investments into building affordable housing from the jump start.,163,,
1011,0.97,8466.891,8478.369,"And the reason is we have asked the community members, nonprofit community members, Bipoc-Led organizations to step up and lead the housing gap.",163,,
1012,0.97,8478.369,8484.709,And they have responded with other $100 million to the office of housing.,163,,
1013,0.97,8484.709,8491.349,The Nofa pot of funding right now for investing in affordable housing is only $35 million.,163,,
1014,0.97,8491.349,8494.819,That's a huge plan of affordable housing projects that are ready to go.,163,,
1015,0.97,8494.819,8499.424,They just need the financial assistance to get there.,163,,
1016,0.97,8499.424,8504.696,The city provides a critical component of that.,163,,
1017,0.97,8504.696,8517.141,"If we end up in a situation where the situation is halves and we are not providing the resources for the developers, we risk the ability to build the projects ready to go, in the pipeline right now.",163,,
1018,0.97,8517.141,8526.351,"And I think that it's a broader question than can you let this go this one year, recognizing that this will be built into the base budget.",163,,
1019,0.97,8526.351,8531.256,I left that up to underscore the importance of why the color of money does matter here.,163,,
1020,0.97,8531.256,8543.134,And I am going to be continuing to look to see how we can potentially move the revenue sources to create stability.,163,,
1021,0.97,8543.134,8544.135,Tom mentioned it.,163,,
1022,0.97,8544.135,8546.604,I asked him to repeat the comment.,163,,
1023,0.97,8546.604,8577.302,"If we look at different ways to fund priorities and identify more appropriate ways to use one-time resources from the Feds versus areas of investment where we know ongoing resources are going to be critical and ongoing resources can lead to greater projects in the future, that's something I'll be diving into other the next few weeks as we try to find the stability in the budget and identify the priorities.",163,,
1024,0.97,8577.302,8578.202,"Councilmember Herbold, take it away.",163,,
1025,0.97,8578.336,8597.155,"Just very briefly, I want to address that the fact that I have heard the proposed 2022 budget as being described as being consistent with the spirit of the jump start funding plan.",164,,
1026,0.97,8597.155,8603.628,And I appreciate that perspective.,164,,
1027,0.97,8603.628,8612.904,"For me, a central commitment of jump start was an ongoing revenue source to double our annual investment in housing.",164,,
1028,0.97,8612.904,8620.979,"For that reason, I do not find the proposed 2022 budget to be consistent with the spirit of the jump start.",164,,
1029,0.97,8620.979,8621.245,Thank you.,164,,
1030,0.97,8621.245,8626.184,.,164,,
1031,0.97,8626.184,8627.952,Well said.,165,,
1032,0.97,8627.952,8628.386,Thank you very much.,165,,
1033,0.97,8628.386,8628.753,Let's continue.,165,,
1034,0.97,8628.886,8636.694,Thank you.,166,,
1035,0.97,8636.694,8643.001,This is the last slide for review of jump start.,166,,
1036,0.97,8643.001,8647.105,"Again, now we're moving to issue identification.",166,,
1037,0.97,8647.105,8647.605,There are three issues.,166,,
1038,0.97,8647.605,8653.311,They will be familiar because of the concepts the community has been discussing around this area.,166,,
1039,0.97,8653.311,8669.394,"First, with regards to jump start on policy change, the proposed budget legislation would change to spend the allocations governing the use of jump start payroll and eliminate the spending plan in the future years.",166,,
1040,0.97,8669.394,8689.18,"Options to consider in light of the issue, one is option a, to do not pass the budget legislation to change the jump start fund policies and amend the budget Accordingly to Aline the spending allocations consistent with the existing policy.",166,,
1041,0.97,8689.18,8695.787,"Second option, option B, would be to amend the legislation to allow different uses for 2022.",166,,
1042,0.97,8695.787,8701.993,"However, but to retain the spending plan for the future years.",166,,
1043,0.97,8701.993,8711.669,"Option C, to amend the spending plan to change the uses in 2022 and continue them at that new revised level in future years.",166,,
1044,0.97,8711.669,8716.24,"And then, again, a final option to take no action.",166,,
1045,0.97,8716.374,8719.71,Thank you very much.,167,,
1046,0.97,8719.71,8724.015,I'm not seeing any hands go up right now.,167,,
1047,0.97,8724.015,8726.818,I will build off of what Councilmember Herbold noted.,167,,
1048,0.97,8726.818,8735.927,Option a for me at this point is staying in line with the commitments that we made to community when we passed progressive jump start payroll tax.,167,,
1049,0.97,8735.927,8740.098,We had committed that the funding would be additive.,167,,
1050,0.97,8740.098,8747.238,We talked about ways in which the commitment would wear off the austerity budgets.,167,,
1051,0.97,8747.238,8750.675,We wanted transparency around the investments maintained.,167,,
1052,0.97,8750.675,8758.85,This was never intended to be a way to fund checks that had been written but no funds Sourced to make it possible to cash the checks.,167,,
1053,0.97,8758.85,8761.786,I want to make sure that what we're doing through jump start is additive.,167,,
1054,0.97,8761.786,8772.463,"At this point, I think there's a lot of interest in also making sure that we're rebuilding the reserves and not having a tail that is longer than anticipated.",167,,
1055,0.97,8772.463,8774.665,We need to rebuild the reserves as well.,167,,
1056,0.97,8774.665,8785.877,And the way in which the Mayor has both invested in different priorities and proposing to change the way in which we build back the reserves creating a great concern for me.,167,,
1057,0.97,8785.877,8799.257,"I am interested in maintaining the fund policies and the spend plan that the Council unanimously passed, unanimously passed twice as it relates to the investments.",167,,
1058,0.97,8799.257,8806.264,And we'll be looking forward to working with you to make sure that we have the ability to invest in share priorities.,167,,
1059,0.97,8806.264,8810.768,I am interested in at this point leaning toward option a.,167,,
1060,0.97,8811.068,8821.045,.,167,,
1061,0.97,8822.28,8825.65,The second issue is regard to jump start fund spending and Sustainability.,168,,
1062,0.97,8825.65,8840.898,This is due to the use of the one-time Federal Clfr moneys to meet the jump start fund spending and investments in 2022 coupled with an assumed higher level of support for the generally fund in 2022.,168,,
1063,0.97,8840.898,8849.44,"In future years, the fund will have $65 million less for the spending plan priorities in 2023 and beyond.",168,,
1064,0.97,8849.44,8864.956,"And then options to address that would include using up to $65 million of one-time Clfr moneys to support one-time 2022 general fund prose Ls, using the revenue replacement provisions and the American rescue plan act.",168,,
1065,0.97,8864.956,8872.663,And reduce the amount of jump start funds deposited.,168,,
1066,0.97,8872.663,8881.906,"This will meet the spirit of the jump start fund priorities with the funds, which would bring the jump start fund closer to compliance with the existing fund policy.",168,,
1067,0.97,8881.906,8889.046,And this will reduce the amount of assumed general fund available for general use in 2023 and beyond.,168,,
1068,0.97,8889.046,8901.959,"Option B would be to cut up to $65 million in the general fund proposals, reduce the transfer from the jump start to the general fund by a singular amount.",168,,
1069,0.97,8901.959,8908.499,"And fund the same amount for housing, local economic recovery, and items similar.",168,,
1070,0.97,8908.499,8911.636,This is the increment and additive to is allocations.,168,,
1071,0.97,8911.636,8914.205,And then the final option would be to take no action.,168,,
1072,0.97,8914.505,8916.841,.,168,,
1073,0.97,8920.144,8920.678,Thanks so much.,169,,
1074,0.97,8920.678,8925.216,I'm not seeing additional hands.,169,,
1075,0.97,8925.216,8925.65,I will reiterate.,169,,
1076,0.97,8925.65,8937.828,To the extent we can find one-time funding that the Federal partners allocated to us to be oriented toward more appropriate one-time funding investments is what I'm looking forward to.,169,,
1077,0.97,8937.828,8949.14,And Repurposing the jump start dollars back to the original spend plan so that we can do our due diligence to stay true to the spend plan as passed unanimously by Council.,169,,
1078,0.97,8949.44,8950.041,.,169,,
1079,0.97,8952.843,8965.723,"And then the final option, tis regards the use of jump start money for homelessness and mental health purposes as opposed to jump start spending plan purposes.",170,,
1080,0.97,8965.723,8971.062,They're described as deviations from the jump start spending plan.,170,,
1081,0.97,8971.062,8977.902,Approximately $3.7 million of funding for services for homelessness and mental health is allocated from the jurisprudence start Fund.,170,,
1082,0.97,8977.902,8984.909,So the options that have been identified would include cutting or reducing those items from the budget.,170,,
1083,0.97,8984.909,8987.978,Identifying a new source of revenue for these items.,170,,
1084,0.97,8987.978,8993.05,And then amend the spending plan to change the uses in 2022 and continue at a similar level in future years.,170,,
1085,0.97,8993.05,8996.854,"And then Finally, to take no action.",170,,
1086,0.97,8996.987,8998.622,Okay.,171,,
1087,0.97,8998.622,9007.365,"Colleagues, if you want more examples of the $3.7 million total to, they're Bulleted on page 21 of the memo in front of you.",171,,
1088,0.97,9007.365,9025.75,"I think there's probably agreement that there's need for investments in creating stability in terms of personnel at the homelessness authority, maintain traditional housing services, and all of these things are things the Council funded in the past.",171,,
1089,0.97,9025.75,9035.393,Finding a different revenue source and more appropriate source for some of these things is where I think we should head to maintain the integrity of jump start.,171,,
1090,0.97,9035.393,9052.009,And there's conversations Councilmember Lewis and Gonzcez as members of the regional homelessness authority will weigh in in the future in the upcoming days to talk about the transition and where the city priority investments go as we hand the responsibility to the regional homelessness authority.,171,,
1091,0.97,9052.009,9061.352,I will be looking to you all to fill in the questions about the stability and the source for those investments as we have policy discussions coming tomorrow on homelessness.,171,,
1092,0.97,9061.352,9067.124,So I look forward to having those discussions with you.,171,,
1093,0.97,9067.124,9080.638,"Again, as it relates to deviations from the spend plan, very much core to our conversations over the next month and a half will be to maintain the integrity of the spend plan as the Council unanimously passed.",171,,
1094,0.97,9080.938,9085.476,.,171,,
1095,0.97,9086.577,9088.179,And that wraps up my portion.,172,,
1096,0.97,9088.179,9094.552,"Unless there are further questions, thank you for the opportunity to present this information this morning.",172,,
1097,0.97,9094.552,9105.029,And happy to provide assistance in future weeks if the Councilmembers have questions about information contained within the memo attached to the agenda.,172,,
1098,0.97,9105.162,9110.201,Okay.,173,,
1099,0.97,9110.201,9116.707,"Tom, thank you for the presentation and the thorough walk through of the revenue sources.",173,,
1100,0.97,9116.707,9118.776,I am not seeing additional hands.,173,,
1101,0.97,9118.776,9122.079,I know that Councilmembers will have the follow-up questions.,173,,
1102,0.97,9122.079,9132.723,A lot of the conversation was orienting us to the proposed budget and identifying the revenue sources for the proposed uses and priorities as the Mayor has outlined.,173,,
1103,0.97,9132.723,9158.282,"As we get into the conversation this afternoon and over the next two days, this is a helpful foundation for us to be able to ask questions about the priority investments and where revenue is being used so that we can craft our amendments and draft our own Council budget document that will be the final product for consideration for the 2022 calendar year budget.",173,,
1104,0.97,9158.282,9162.052,"With that, I'm not seeing additional hands.",173,,
1105,0.97,9162.052,9164.488,We're adjourning a little bit early.,173,,
1106,0.97,9164.488,9166.524,You will have almost a two-hour recess.,173,,
1107,0.97,9166.524,9167.758,We will come back at 2:00 P.M.,173,,
1108,0.97,9167.758,9172.329,So that we can wrap up the discussion.,173,,
1109,0.97,9172.329,9177.101,"If there's no objection, today's select budget committee meeting will be in recess until 2:00 P.M.",173,,
1110,0.97,9177.101,9180.271,"Hearing no objection, thank you so much.",173,,
1111,0.97,9180.271,9183.04,Looking forward to the presentation along with economic development.,173,,
1112,0.97,9183.04,9183.974,See you at 2:00 P.M.,173,,
