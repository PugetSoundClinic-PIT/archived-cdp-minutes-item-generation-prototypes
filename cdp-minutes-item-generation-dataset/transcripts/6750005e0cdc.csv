214,0.97,1586.284,1611.843,"I think it also sets a good precedent for what I would like to see as a broader strategy in our historic designations where we protect old buildings with a lot of character in Single- family neighborhoods but carve out space for multiple housing units within them to not only preserve character, but and much-needed density and housing options for folks.",16,,
215,0.97,1611.843,1613.745,In neighborhoods where housing options can sometimes be limited.,16,,
