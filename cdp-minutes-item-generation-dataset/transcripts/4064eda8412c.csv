129,0.97,738.204,747.68,This is not actually leading to those housing to local plans and development regulations.,30,,
130,0.97,747.68,756.055,It would do some updating to the growth management act to make sure it's included in not just encouraged.,30,,
131,0.97,756.055,765.898,It requires those two displacement in the housing element of that plan.,30,,
132,0.97,765.898,784.817,"Then, finally it would require cities to allow permanent supportive housing, emergency shelters, or other emergency housing.",30,,
133,0.97,784.817,787.82,In multi family commercial are mixed used zones anywhere where the short-term rentals are allowed.,30,,

135,0.97,794.26,822.354,"Although, the House bill 1236 the Eviction bill that includes affixed to the Seattle loophole just so that it would apply to those fixed term leases as well as the month-to-month lease this is scheduled for executive action.",30,,
136,0.97,822.354,833.365,This is a document recording fees bills that would generate over $100 million statewide for an additional recording fee is actually scheduled in the House appropriations.,30,,
137,0.97,833.365,834.233,That didn't pass before the cut off.,30,,
138,0.97,834.233,838.404,"But, it was unmarked necessary to implement the budgets.",30,,
139,0.97,838.404,845.678,"So, it is still continuing in the process.",30,,
140,0.97,845.678,862.094,The Senate bill that provides an offering for the Eviction moratorium and includes the details on payment plans and a right to counsel has a public hearing in the House committee.,30,,
141,0.97,862.094,866.065,"Then, finally to close out the housing front.",30,,
142,0.97,866.065,878.611,"That the Senate bill 5428 which would've exempted the temporary shelter, traditional Encampments.",30,,
143,0.97,878.611,881.146,"Unfortunately, it didn't make it past the House of origin cut off.",30,,
144,0.97,881.146,883.482,"Now, Posit before I go to take any other questions.",30,,
145,0.97,883.482,889.822,I do see that the Councilmember has her hand raised.,31,,
146,0.97,889.822,905.804,"The House bill 1236, as you just mentioned, I know that you discussed this last Monday when they all came to provide that on just cause with the Eviction.",32,,
147,0.97,905.804,917.917,This bill would be close to what the end of these loopholes which we had been playing for good.,32,,
148,0.97,917.917,924.123,This also opens up other loopholes that could be more damaging.,32,,
149,0.97,924.123,928.16,I know last week you mentioned something about how there were those amendments.,32,,
150,0.97,928.16,937.937,"Anyway, really there are loopholes allowing Evictions.",32,,
151,0.97,937.937,944.143,And allowing them for those regions.,32,,
152,0.97,944.143,947.947,Both loopholes are very loosely defined.,32,,
153,0.97,947.947,962.561,"So, if you have information here, how would this impact Seattle's just cause of the Eviction ordinance in other words, are they going to be forced to accept these?",32,,
154,0.97,962.561,968.901,Or those protections like the ban on those.,32,,
155,0.97,968.901,970.302,Thank you Councilmember.,33,,
156,0.97,970.302,984.984,"You know, I think that they will sort of analyze the amendments and then talk with the housing advocates.",33,,
157,0.97,984.984,989.088,I do understand that there is a possibility that it could be further amended as it moves through the process.,33,,
158,0.97,989.088,996.929,I will follow up and I will get back to you and your staff to let you know.,33,,
159,0.97,996.929,1006.171,I do think that we would probably be required to pass local legislation to implement some of the provisions but I'm actually not sure but I will check in with the attorney's office.,33,,
160,0.97,1006.171,1011.643,With the impact.,33,,
161,0.97,1011.643,1014.446,With the shape that it is in.,33,,
162,0.97,1014.446,1018.417,With all of those information's as well.,33,,
163,0.97,1018.417,1021.22,"Obviously, this is what happens to Seattle.",33,,
164,0.97,1021.22,1024.957,"But, it's not that interest either.",33,,
165,0.97,1024.957,1031.73,This is to be offered the best possible protections.,33,,
166,0.97,1031.73,1044.977,Especially in this where they are so in the Americans nationwide carrying an average with $6000.,33,,
167,0.97,1044.977,1045.744,"So, I know that times are hard.",33,,
168,0.97,1045.744,1054.053,"So, overall it would be that kind of concern with the Follow- up on this.",33,,
169,0.97,1054.053,1063.896,"Not an attorney but, it seems like they are big enough that those winters in Seattle will become less.",33,,
170,0.97,1063.896,1076.842,"And also, appreciate it if you know anything with an amendment to stop those with the work that you've already said.",33,,
171,0.97,1076.842,1081.613,And initiating with that office.,33,,
172,0.97,1081.613,1093.225,"Certainly Councilmember, this is as the bill moves forward.",34,,
173,0.97,1093.225,1096.595,So I appreciate everybody's advocacy on this issue.,34,,
174,0.97,1096.595,1101.233,Councilmember Lewis here.,35,,
175,0.97,1101.233,1102.201,Thank you so much.,36,,
176,0.97,1102.201,1108.574,I want to dig in a little bit into 5428 which doesn't make it past the House of origin.,36,,
177,0.97,1108.574,1116.448,Not in my conversations with the human services Department.,36,,
178,0.97,1116.448,1124.022,They are with that House bill in particular.,36,,
179,0.97,1124.022,1128.961,With those predatory delays.,36,,
180,0.97,1128.961,1139.571,"The first question is, with those folks down in Olympia.",36,,
181,0.97,1139.571,1140.038,Within that title.,36,,
182,0.97,1140.038,1144.943,That is still alive.,36,,
183,0.97,1144.943,1151.083,I would like to know the status of that.,36,,
184,0.97,1151.083,1161.493,Whether we can pursue.,36,,
185,0.97,1161.86,1163.462,Some kind of emergency order and the governor.,36,,

299,0.97,2104.936,2105.303,At that level.,46,,

305,0.97,2145.243,2167.265,"Just because all those costs associated with a shelter for people over 65 and or with Comorbidities, cannot be reimbursed if Alban can't be reimbursed, that does not mean that we should not go forward to implement a plan since we know that the majority of those costs will ultimately need criteria for reimbursement.",46,,
306,0.97,2167.265,2184.682,"This proposal getting walked on today has incorporated feedback that the counsel has received from the Mayor's office, the city budget office and the deed from FEMA himself.",46,,
307,0.97,2184.682,2191.188,"He offered them a path forward for the biggest crisis facing us indeed one that looms as large as the Coronavirus itself, the crisis of thousands of our neighbors experiencing homelessness.",46,,

707,0.97,4968.697,4981.776,"I'm looking forward to hearing more from staff about the great design change for I'm sorry, the rates proposed from the Seattle rate.",76,,
708,0.97,4981.776,4991.987,They may remember that this is what I spent the majority of 2018 working on after many years of those Stakeholders really clamoring for a more equitable distribution of rates.,76,,
709,0.97,4991.987,4999.928,I'm excited to hear that there isn't a rate increase or potentially next year.,76,,
710,0.97,4999.928,5003.498,I just want to make sure that I get the chance to review the central staff memo.,76,,
711,0.97,5003.498,5004.232,It would be helpful.,76,,
712,0.97,5004.232,5012.607,I understand that the memo isn't available.,76,,
713,0.97,5012.607,5019.914,"It would be helpful to hear how these changes that we made in 2018 are now factoring in those rates because, sometimes you don't often get to see those Legislations that you put into place.",76,,
714,0.97,5019.914,5030.558,"If there is a advancement in 2018, that would be very helpful to see highlighted in the memo from central staff.",76,,
715,0.97,5030.558,5034.462,Thank you for that question.,77,,
716,0.97,5034.462,5034.662,Yes.,77,,
717,0.97,5034.662,5049.577,"The central staff memo will provide more details as you recall, every couple of years, we have approved a rate path and, thank you for your leadership on that.",77,,
718,0.97,5049.577,5085.313,"When you are the chair of the committee, basically what's happening must, they were able to keep the utility bills level for this year due to the Coronavirus even though there was an increase expected for 2021 just as the rate path that was agreed upon in 2022, the rate path, was agreed upon, is a 3.9% increase.",77,,
719,0.97,5085.313,5093.321,"And, so they are going to keep that promise or even come in blow that.",77,,
720,0.97,5093.321,5100.528,The central staff memo will hold and explain the financial gymnastics that they are doing to try to make that happen.,77,,
721,0.97,5100.528,5102.23,Thank you so much.,78,,
722,0.97,5102.23,5107.435,Are there any other questions or comments?,79,,
723,0.97,5107.435,5107.769,All Rigt.,80,,
724,0.97,5107.769,5109.137,"Hearing none, we are moving on.",80,,
725,0.97,5109.137,5111.439,Good morning.,80,,
726,0.97,5111.439,5114.542,Thank you and good morning to everyone.,81,,
727,0.97,5114.542,5119.414,There is one item on today's agenda from the Sustainability and Renters rights committee.,81,,
728,0.97,5119.414,5135.53,"The right for the office being to striving the right for several weeks reaching out to several offices to find out if those questions and as many know, office and Renters rights advocates and the labor unions.",81,,
729,0.97,5135.53,5141.069,The union members have been fighting for their rights.,81,,
730,0.97,5141.069,5144.973,Facing their Addictions as well.,81,,
731,0.97,5144.973,5148.643,I'm very pleased to see it coming to a vote in that date.,81,,
732,0.97,5148.643,5157.752,We got that private funding there for the pros project movements.,81,,
733,0.97,5157.752,5165.593,And Constance and to support more Renters for the people's budget movement as well.,81,,
734,0.97,5165.593,5168.062,For the Eviction offense.,81,,
735,0.97,5168.062,5173.001,They discussed the first map there in January.,81,,
736,0.97,5173.001,5182.01,And the revised draft it was passed 3-1 at the last committee.,81,,
737,0.97,5182.01,5186.881,And Councilman's there Peterson.,81,,
738,0.97,5186.881,5189.117,This is from the city council staff.,81,,
739,0.97,5189.117,5197.258,"A memo explaining the legislation but, the last committee two weeks ago and since then, there is a Follow- up question.",81,,
740,0.97,5197.258,5203.198,Particularly here with those Renters.,81,,
741,0.97,5203.198,5209.604,With those loopholes as well.,81,,
742,0.97,5209.604,5214.742,With the important reason for the legislation are not the financial cost for the city.,81,,
743,0.97,5214.742,5226.154,But still the human cost for them facing Eviction.,81,,
744,0.97,5229.924,5231.759,With the women's Commission and the county bar Association.,81,,
745,0.97,5231.759,5237.865,Merely nine out of 10 people become homeless as a result.,81,,
746,0.97,5237.865,5253.348,The cost of providing those homeless services and funding well . es in the first place as this is what everybody can see.,81,,
747,0.97,5253.348,5259.153,Those are calculated based on what data she had at her disposal.,81,,
748,0.97,5259.153,5267.562,She let Councilmembers know that that is the reality.,81,,
749,0.97,5267.562,5278.273,I would just say by the member numbers that we have there with multiple cities.,81,,
750,0.97,5278.273,5281.976,The reality is anything close to those estimates.,81,,
751,0.97,5281.976,5282.81,Anything that fall apart.,81,,
752,0.97,5282.81,5291.419,"The right to counsel will see that and that conclusion as I said before, Aligns very much with the results.",81,,
753,0.97,5291.419,5297.425,Just with those already.,81,,
754,0.97,5297.425,5303.231,"Again, my motivation for this, with the human impact of the Eviction.",81,,
755,0.97,5303.231,5306.801,That is what they have mostly highlighted.,81,,
756,0.97,5306.801,5311.506,Of those numbers.,81,,
757,0.97,5311.506,5315.009,With those questions of financial impact.,81,,
758,0.97,5315.009,5316.01,With the legislation.,81,,
759,0.97,5316.01,5323.518,This office with those amendments.,81,,
760,0.97,5323.518,5326.754,With the bill as well.,81,,
761,0.97,5326.754,5336.064,Making sure that they are able to explain that.,81,,
762,0.97,5336.064,5337.298,Also on today's city council agenda.,81,,
763,0.97,5337.298,5346.607,As a resolution from my office urging the Mayor and the governor to extend the moratorium on the Evictions in the state as a whole.,81,,
764,0.97,5346.607,5362.023,"I want to make it crystal clear, that we will need the right to come so that when the Eviction moratorium ends, it is not an excuse to end it.",81,,
765,0.97,5363.324,5364.525,"It has sparked that, continued unabated.",81,,
766,0.97,5364.525,5371.899,The moratorium is scheduled to expire in 16 days.,81,,
767,0.97,5371.899,5390.585,And they will need that housing or need to answer them actually facing homelessness we do have laws on the books giving them a defense against the Eviction and this is still thousands drafting to the Eviction code before they can take advantage of those defenses.,81,,
768,0.97,5390.585,5400.128,"Like the right to counsel, they are essential.",81,,
769,0.97,5400.128,5401.095,We should keep them in place.,81,,
770,0.97,5401.095,5406.734,But it's also not an excuse for failing to extend that moratorium at an unprecedented period that we are in right now.,81,,
771,0.97,5406.734,5420.348,"They should not have to be evicted and go to the Eviction court if there will be significant rental assistance available, absolutely, it is our duty to get that out as much a possible.",81,,
772,0.97,5420.348,5423.918,Remove that rent backlog before allowing those Evictions.,81,,
773,0.97,5423.918,5434.662,They had that labor community rights and homeless advocacy organizations who sent a joint letter urging her to extend the moratorium.,81,,
774,0.97,5434.662,5459.187,"I also find the Lgbtq who have been advocating for the Mayor, Governor, and extending that of this year.",81,,
775,0.97,5462.957,5470.798,"As a letter from this organization say, we need to ""prevent a massive wave of Eviction filings causing them to celebrate because they are afraid, don't understand their rights or Delve into fight it.",81,,
776,0.97,5470.798,5473.401,This is part of the resolution to extend the moratorium.,81,,
777,0.97,5473.401,5500.428,"And also, for the right of the rights and they shouldn't be loopholes in the legislation because, the data doesn't even Caption those tenants who end up leaving when they receive the Eviction notice because they are understandably able to go to the courts and they are daunted by the labyrinth that confronts them.",81,,
778,0.97,5500.428,5503.264,They end up leaving because they don't to face that situation in the first place.,81,,
779,0.97,5503.264,5514.108,"To go further from the letter ""small businesses and Nonprofits are struggling to pick it will be a long time until they are able to operate at full capacity.",81,,
780,0.97,5514.108,5515.142,They had to close temporarily.,81,,
781,0.97,5515.142,5528.456,The Eviction moratorium with the Nonprofits here and they are using that time to take the security away.,81,,
782,0.97,5528.456,5538.666,They will give tenants time instability enabling more Renters and small businesses to get caught up on rent and allowing rental assistance programs time to work in court.,81,,
783,0.97,5538.666,5546.474,Evictions are disproportionately used against people of color and they are disproportionately used about women.,81,,
784,0.97,5546.474,5550.144,Even not a pandemic.,81,,
785,0.97,5550.144,5557.985,"And in the midst of the reception, they will be an unprecedented disaster.",81,,
786,0.97,5557.985,5559.453,It is a new University scenario.,81,,
787,0.97,5559.453,5568.763,That was released in 2019.,81,,
788,0.97,5568.763,5580.975,They are just as likely to keep their housing but only 10% of tenants facing Eviction had that with 90% of landlords.,81,,
789,0.97,5580.975,5586.18,And the study also found more evidence of how it impacts women and people of color disproportionately.,81,,
790,0.97,5586.18,5597.191,I think both the resolution extending the Eviction moratorium and the right to that legislation for the legal aid facing Eviction.,81,,
791,0.97,5597.191,5603.531,Without any obstacles with both important.,81,,
792,0.97,5603.531,5625.453,The associated press courted the senior organization official that it is to make sure these are the quoted words this is being clear that those Vaccinations being available and it's actually very welcome.,81,,
793,0.97,5625.453,5627.154,Or a relief for a lot of people.,81,,
794,0.97,5627.154,5639.433,And the community that's not the same I hope that they will support both of these bills.,81,,
795,0.97,5639.433,5645.673,They are scheduled at the regular time.,81,,
796,0.97,5645.673,5650.611,Thank you so much.,82,,
797,0.97,5650.611,5655.483,Any comments or questions on that report.,82,,
798,0.97,5655.483,5656.984,Councilmember Herbert.,82,,
799,0.97,5656.984,5674.735,I just want to take this time to Smite the amendments number as a mentioned and thank you for your support Councilmember Sawant.,83,,
800,0.97,5674.735,5676.637,I agree that these are intended as from the amendments.,83,,
801,0.97,5676.637,5688.115,The first one testifies that an attorney organization with the Sierra Department inspections.,83,,
802,0.97,5688.115,5692.019,They were suggested by the longtime advocate.,83,,
803,0.97,5692.019,5709.303,Of the tenants right with the experience and advocating for they have many legal organizations that provide by the advice by those notices.,83,,
804,0.97,5709.303,5717.311,With those notices as well.,83,,
805,0.97,5717.311,5718.946,And also representing those in very narrow situations.,83,,
806,0.97,5718.946,5720.848,"So, this bill is not a funding mechanism.",83,,
807,0.97,5720.848,5734.662,With the Council including this intention in the bill for that policy those made available to represent those tenants and a quarter room.,83,,
808,0.97,5734.662,5746.474,The second amendment requires the organization with whom the city eventually contract with to provide those numbers of cases of representation that occurs outside of the initial appearance or show cause hearing.,84,,
809,0.97,5746.474,5751.378,The vast number of these cases never go beyond a show cause hearing.,84,,
810,0.97,5751.378,5759.987,"In King County, only 11 out of 9000 cases went to trial.",84,,
811,0.97,5759.987,5777.204,"But with recent statewide and local law reform, to the Eviction process, the larger number of cases may be going to trial.",84,,
812,0.97,5777.204,5790.584,This information will be added to other information reported as required by a contract and it could inform the council about whether or not future legislative sessions may need to be made to address issues brought about by an increase in the need for representation beyond the show cause hearing and into the trials.,84,,
813,0.97,5790.584,5794.889,Thank you.,84,,
814,0.97,5794.889,5797.324,Thank you so much.,85,,
815,0.97,5797.324,5807.801,Any comments or questions?,85,,
816,0.97,5808.068,5808.402,I'm hearing none.,85,,
817,0.97,5808.402,5811.539,We will go ahead and move down the line in here from the Councilmember.,85,,
818,0.97,5811.539,5811.805,Good morning.,85,,
819,0.97,5813.941,5814.275,I'm sorry.,86,,
820,0.97,5814.275,5817.344,I was struggling with my mute button.,86,,
821,0.97,5817.344,5818.479,I will try to keep this short.,86,,
822,0.97,5818.479,5823.083,This is a longer report this morning than usual.,86,,
823,0.97,5823.083,5834.228,"So, there are no items from the Committee on today's introduction or calendar.",86,,
824,0.97,5834.228,5837.164,There are five items from the Land-Use neighborhoods Committee on the full council agenda.,86,,
825,0.97,5837.164,5858.485,The Council bill here with a small business flexibility bill is on today's agenda which will make it easier for the entrepreneurs and Smal businesses to operate out of their home.,86,,
826,0.97,5858.485,5861.055,Last week I reported that brandy had mentioned that she supported this bill.,86,,
827,0.97,5861.055,5862.59,I went back and watch my interview.,86,,
828,0.97,5862.59,5865.059,"She didn't say that, she merely stated that it was Uncontroversial.",86,,
829,0.97,5865.059,5867.294,She may have Jinxed it there.,86,,
830,0.97,5867.294,5876.704,"Moving forward, it supports entrepreneurs to turn dreams into realities providing incubation for those vacant storefronts.",86,,
831,0.97,5876.704,5883.01,Some of those successful businesses in the world and important innovative designs are born out of garages.,86,,
832,0.97,5883.01,5904.832,We know that the Land-Use coach should not be a barrier to vibrant neighborhood in a successful economy understanding that there are a multitude of different regulatory bodies around small businesses and around home occupancy businesses and the Land-Use code is just the bottom layer of multiple different layers of regulation.,86,,
833,0.97,5904.832,5913.24,I just wanted to take this moment to ask to see if there any questions about the afternoons bill.,86,,
834,0.97,5913.24,5930.557,"Any questions or comments wondering from the proposal inexpensive, it might be an appropriate time to surface my amendment?",87,,
835,0.97,5930.557,5932.66,"Absolutely, please.",88,,
836,0.97,5932.66,5940.2,This is considered to be my perspective.,89,,
837,0.97,5940.2,5945.239,I believe that they flee the other.,89,,
838,0.97,5945.239,5952.346,They have already indicated this is a friendly amendment.,89,,
839,0.97,5952.346,5959.586,They require that a home occupation not have a drive.,89,,
840,0.97,5959.586,5963.49,They have those occupations here for those automated cereals.,89,,
841,0.97,5963.49,5967.194,That is for the on Street parking or vehicle traffic.,89,,
842,0.97,5967.194,5980.207,"I'm sorry, that was a Two- part amendment, Councilmember can you Resend that?",90,,
843,0.97,5980.207,5984.712,"The second part of the amendment was, they are both related to vehicles.",91,,
844,0.97,5984.712,5997.791,The first relates to stating the home occupation is not reliant on vehicles.,91,,
845,0.97,5997.791,5999.56,"So, it doesn't have a driving business component.",91,,
846,0.97,5999.56,6006.6,The second relates to basically automotive sales and vehicle service.,91,,
847,0.97,6006.6,6025.019,Stating that if there is a home occupation related to an automated sales those are not prohibited if there is one related to sales and service.,91,,
848,0.97,6025.019,6030.324,They shouldn't cause an increase in the on Street parking or the vehicle traffic.,91,,
849,0.97,6030.324,6037.364,This is specifically for car sales are car services.,91,,
850,0.97,6037.364,6044.037,This bill does not say that the home occupations cannot include car sales and car services.,91,,
851,0.97,6044.037,6054.548,"But that if they should, or if they do, that they should not involve a substantial increase to get the parking or traffic.",91,,
852,0.97,6054.548,6067.494,"Councilmember Lisa Herbold, this is just for those folks who are running a mechanics shop out of the garage, in their neighborhood.",92,,
853,0.97,6067.494,6085.279,Your amendment is designed to narrowly focus on that kind of business as it relates to the potential impacts on the on Street parking and traffic?,92,,
854,0.97,6085.279,6085.846,Yes.,93,,
855,0.97,6085.846,6086.113,Okay.,94,,
856,0.97,6086.113,6094.521,Thank you Councilmember.,95,,

953,0.97,6924.217,6932.425,So last week the committee had an opportunity to meet.,99,,

962,0.97,7030.823,7048.374,The board has unanimously recommended the appointment of mark Jones and I'm looking forward to being able to support that nomination and just taking another step in the implementation of standing up in the original homelessness authority.,99,,
963,0.97,7048.374,7076.803,"The Collies also last Thursday I had an opportunity to be joined by central staff, the office of emergency management and the meeting with the administrators to get clear feedback regarding the city's ability to seek reimbursement for those services which are particularly necessary during the public health emergency.",99,,
964,0.97,7076.803,7078.504,It was an extremely helpful and productive meeting.,99,,
965,0.97,7078.504,7087.547,And I'm grateful to the office of relations for setting up this meeting at my request and for the staff to being available to answer the city's questions.,99,,
966,0.97,7087.547,7091.784,I wanted to provide a high- level summary.,99,,
967,0.97,7091.784,7121.848,"But I also want to make sure that all of you have an open invitation to contact either me and my office or Justin and from the central staff if you would like a more detailed summary of the meeting that we had .

968,0.97,7121.848,7129.655,"Administrators are able to address these questions during the meeting and providing the need of clarity and ambiguities that the city has perceived in the variance guidance, policies put out by the last 12 months.",99,,
969,0.97,7129.655,7153.88,"As an example of the type of questions that were addressed, they clarify that the availability of other Federal funding streams for particular services such as the care is active dollars wouldn't disqualify, the city from seeking those reimbursements for the services.",99,,
970,0.97,7153.88,7165.791,This response directly dampened concerns raised by the executive which had previously communicated the belief that the availability of other Federal resources could be a roadblock.,99,,
971,0.97,7165.791,7171.697,In the effort to seek those reimbursement shelter services.,99,,
972,0.97,7171.697,7177.27,"So, this and other answers provided in that meeting removed many of the ambiguities.",99,,
973,0.97,7177.27,7191.584,Represented as justification for not pursuing that sheltering strategy that the Council had been advocating for.,99,,
974,0.97,7191.584,7224.116,While it is true that there are certain parameters and criteria which the shelter services need to meet in order for the reimbursement the bottom line is while there can be no absolute guarantees we can nonetheless be very confident that none congregate shelter is indeed FEMA Reimbursable within specific parameters.,99,,
975,0.97,7224.917,7244.37,"At this point, I continue to believe that there is no justification for providing essential set shelter services in temporarily assuming the cost of helping those most vulnerable to the Coronavirus pandemic because we both know that there is a real opportunity to seek 100% costs to help this responsibility to the Coronavirus.",99,,
976,0.97,7244.37,7249.542,"As in part, why am looking forward to the introduction and consideration that the Councilmember shared with us this morning.",99,,

979,0.97,7268.594,7279.438,I'm hopeful that this meeting will help close the gap between the Mayor's office by gaining a shared interpretation and understanding of the policies.,99,,
980,0.97,7279.438,7294.186,I am now extraordinarily excited to move forward in a collaborative way to help address the dual crisis of homelessness and Covid-19 in our community.,99,,
981,0.97,7294.186,7304.73,I look forward to the conversation we will be having in the committee to effectuate the counsel's desire of strategy around temporarily assuming those costs.,99,,
982,0.97,7304.73,7310.703,It's keeping the door open here for reimbursement.,99,,
