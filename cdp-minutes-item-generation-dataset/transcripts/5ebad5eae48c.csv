89,0.97,716.749,721.854,The current Husky Stadium Tmp was adopted in 1986.,22,,
90,0.97,721.854,735.234,"That was associated--that requirement was associated with a land use action or permitting action where the expanded the Stadium capacity from 58,000 to 72,000.",22,,

95,0.97,776.509,780.813,The transportation and environment has changed dramatically.,22,,

It was developed as a response of the North upper deck, which increased Stadium capacity from 58,000 to 72,000 fans . The goal is to accommodate the crowd capacity and have less reliance on parking in the central areas and to Expeditepostgame traffic.",23,,
99,0.97,834.366,836.602,Those are good goals but they are not sufficient for 2021.,23,,
100,0.97,836.602,865.03,"Next slide, please . to accomplish those goals established in 1980s, Husky fans were provided with a free transit script to ride the buses . a very detailed flow of parking around the Stadium was created and we created an intercept survey to modify transportation and two oversight committees were also created . next slide, please.",23,,
101,0.97,865.03,877.443,Tmp from the Mid-80S has been outdated . We have been working with our partners to be current with the times but we need to start looking ahead for the next 30 years and beyond.,23,,

119,0.97,1030.162,1037.102,Dan alluded to that.,24,,
120,0.97,1037.102,1048.48,This graphic shows with the 1986 goals were and the new goals . I am breaking this down by private vehicle and non-auto vehicle.,24,,

124,0.97,1074.907,1076.041,Thank you.,27,,
125,0.97,1076.041,1104.87,"The footnotes that East link is planning to open in 2023, the chart shows 54% non-auto use in 2022 for event attendees and 8% in 2024 when Lynwood link opens in 2024, but I do not see any goals associated with the 2023 link opening.",27,,
126,0.97,1104.87,1120.319,"Yeah . We decided to note that change but not to set or do that in the increment of 2022 and 2024, recognizing East link will factor into the 2024 Goalsetting.",28,,

131,0.97,1130.662,1140.672,I would look to Dan for that . I think Dan might be able to pull it up quicker than I.,31,,
132,0.97,1140.672,1142.908,Maybe we could get to that in the end.,31,,
133,0.97,1142.908,1160.025,"1986 was very low for transit use . Since Husky Stadium opened and since then, it would be interesting to see how the 2019 or 2018 Actuals compare to the goal for 2022, whether we are actually exceeding.",32,,
134,0.97,1160.025,1172.471,"I believe in the Tmp document itself, it is an attachment . There is a historic Trending.",33,,

141,0.97,1221.053,1231.463,"Thanks, Ann, and thanks to everyone on the call.",36,,
142,0.97,1231.463,1244.409,This new Tmp has a secondary goal . We are working in partnership with the partners along here realizing that the impact of the Stadium isn't just at the Stadium.,36,,
143,0.97,1244.409,1250.582,There are impacts within the whole sub area.,36,,
144,0.97,1250.582,1254.82,This Goalie came up with was to basically reduce duration of the mobility disruptions Postevent mostly.,36,,
145,0.97,1254.82,1279.645,"That is basically within the sub area of the District trying to return to our baseline normal Nonevent conditions . Our preliminary goal was 60 to 75 minutes, so getting back down to baseline post event so we can operate the community and the impact the community is experiencing is minimized as much as possible.",36,,
146,0.97,1279.645,1301.767,Dan mentioned we are investing resources in the transportation infrastructure so that we can collect travel times and we can identify when people going to the games are leaving and adjust the signal system to help vehicles and to help people out into the greater area region.,36,,
147,0.97,1301.767,1310.275,"Within that, we have performance monitoring goals . They will reflect data on travel times.",36,,
148,0.97,1310.275,1315.18,There are a number of things we will do to see how we are doing.,36,,
149,0.97,1315.18,1342.374,"Annually we will be collecting these goals . If you go to the next slide, we will lead into what we are calling this annual operations plan . Today we are focusing specifically on the transportation management plan, which is a separate document that basically calls out the operations plan or addresses the operations plan.",36,,
150,0.97,1342.374,1346.578,This was a one time this is how we are going to operate everything.,36,,
151,0.97,1346.578,1365.097,This is the annual operations plan to more or less allow for changing conditions out there to be identified through our surveys and performance monitoring enter the on boarding of technologies and Whatnot to basically update this plan which will include the traffic control plans.,36,,
152,0.97,1365.097,1370.802,It includes strategies for transit.,36,,
153,0.97,1370.802,1388.32,"There are a number of things we will be identifying annually to basically update this plan to best facilitate and meet those goals that are in the Tmp . If you go to the next slide, you can kind of see the Timeline of how we plan on doing this.",36,,
154,0.97,1388.32,1396.228,Dan mentioned there used to be two advisory committees and each had a separate role and it was tough to get them together.,36,,
155,0.97,1396.228,1437.068,"This Tmp creates a single advisory committee . If you look around, basically it is a cycle every year . You know, we have the games, we implement the plan we have in place for the year, we perform all of the data collection surveys and Whatnot . We have an annual report that will be produced and the report will be evaluated with the advisory committee . We will come up with specific new strategies if necessary, if we are not completing the goals . from that we will have an updated operations plan annually that we will use for the following season to try to minimize the impacts we have.",36,,
156,0.97,1437.068,1446.378,"As you can see, the group consists of chairs and a number of folks throughout the community and different partners.",36,,
157,0.97,1446.378,1463.628,"And just to clarify, that Acronym at the bottom, C.U.C.A.C.",37,,
158,0.97,1463.628,1467.833,", that is where the community would be having input on the annual basis.",37,,
159,0.97,1467.833,1469.534,Thank you.,37,,
160,0.97,1469.534,1479.511,"I think with that, I can turn it back over to Ann and she will talk a little bit about the comparisons and the next steps.",38,,
161,0.97,1479.511,1488.42,"Thank you, dusty . the next slides are a simplified comparison matrix for the city council.",39,,
162,0.97,1488.42,1502.634,We do have the Council package in a more detailed comparison matrix of what key elements of the 1986 Tmp and what is proposed in the new Tmp . I think we have covered a lot of that already.,39,,
163,0.97,1502.634,1519.751,We are moving from a very detailed document with a lot of specification to a framework document adopted by the Council and pulling out an operations plan that could be updated as long as it is aligned with the Tmp document . that will be updated annually.,39,,
164,0.97,1519.751,1525.557,"It has approached goals, strategy, and objectives.",39,,
165,0.97,1525.557,1540.071,"Thresholds are clarified . in the document, it shows when the Tmp goes into effect and the number of events that are allowed in the Stadium.",39,,
166,0.97,1540.071,1545.076,The annual review process is a simplified through the operations plan.,39,,
167,0.97,1545.076,1555.487,We streamline a somewhat onerous and cumbersome two tiered advisory system that didn't work very well in the past.,39,,
168,0.97,1555.487,1570.101,"We have a formalized performance training . annually in the past, Husky Stadium did turn in an annual report but this makes the reporting and performance review process clear.",39,,
169,0.97,1570.101,1575.507,"Thank you, Ann . Calvin chow has a comment or question.",40,,
170,0.97,1575.507,1652.183,"Thanks . Ann, as you're going through this, these are the detailed differences but I want to remind everyone that really does updated Tmp is much more in line with Tmps that we have for other major institution plans . the way we tend to do these now is to establish the Overarching performance goals and establishing sort of ongoing monitoring and limitation to be flexible to changing conditions . as much as there are lot of details and specific changes, the biggest change between 1986 and 2021 is our whole approach to this sort of adapted management . I also would note that typically we would see Tmp come forward as part of development action or part of the master plan . The 1986 proposal came about because the Husky Stadium was increasing development capacity, or seating capacity at the Stadium and there is no action at Husky Stadium now . This really is about sort of updating an out of date process more than anything and being able to track that with the community and with staff involved as they go forward.",41,,
171,0.97,1652.183,1662.694,I didn't want us to get too lost in the Minutia of what is changing and also remember the broader strategy change that is going on here.,41,,
172,0.97,1662.694,1666.531,Thank you.,42,,
173,0.97,1666.531,1671.836,Thanks . I will quickly cover this last slide.,43,,
174,0.97,1671.836,1677.108,"We already reviewed major goals and key changes, proposed changes in the strategy.",43,,
175,0.97,1677.108,1688.52,One item of big change was an emphasis and it needing updating is the area about trying to support increased transit uses.,43,,
176,0.97,1688.52,1714.946,"We have had a huge growth and a lot of that is about the rich growth of our transit network over 37 years in the city of Seattle . at the time, there was not such a rich network and the Uw provided and still provides a special service for game day parking lot to Husky Stadium.",43,,
177,0.97,1714.946,1726.758,Some of that special service no longer makes sense because the regional transit is replacing that . a good upcoming example with the opening of Northgate light rail station in October.,43,,
178,0.97,1726.758,1740.805,They are required to have special bus service from parking Redline and that would not make sense anymore . This allows the phasing out over time and administratively with the review of the special service.,43,,
179,0.97,1740.805,1747.045,If we find an acceptable alternative is available.,43,,
180,0.97,1747.045,1757.388,Similarly at the time there is reference to free transit script . that was basically back in 1986 for those writing the special service.,43,,
181,0.97,1757.388,1764.095,They were supposed to have the tickets for free.,43,,
182,0.97,1764.095,1770.401,We have been giving them a waiver for the past several years and have not seen any significant change in Ridership.,43,,
183,0.97,1770.401,1784.616,"Husky Stadium still pays for the special service, but the ticket is a bundled up in the ticket pass.",43,,
184,0.97,1784.616,1793.925,"Other things that were not envisioned at the time, Ride- share . There was a heavy focus in 1986 for Ride-Share.",43,,
185,0.97,1793.925,1797.929,Uber and Lyft did not exist.,43,,
186,0.97,1797.929,1813.845,Uw has Ride-Share on their own campus . They bring ride operators and require them to come onto their campus so they do not impact the general purpose traffic.,43,,
187,0.97,1813.845,1818.082,Those of the highlights I will focus on for the differences.,43,,
188,0.97,1818.082,1820.351,"So, what our next steps?",43,,
189,0.97,1820.351,1826.457,"This says July, but we are here in August.",43,,
190,0.97,1826.457,1829.694,"If the Council decides to act on the resolution, you will be adopting that Higher-Level Tmp.",43,,
191,0.97,1829.694,1851.015,We would use that as a guide for working with our advisory committee to finalize an operational plan that would go into effect for the 2022 season . that concludes our presentation . We will open it up for any other questions from Councilmembers.,43,,
192,0.97,1851.015,1851.616,Thank you.,44,,
193,0.97,1851.616,1853.985,We will also hear from the University of Washington as well.,44,,
194,0.97,1853.985,1860.792,I just wanted to confirm . is our Seattle Department of education supports this plan.,44,,
195,0.97,1860.792,1861.392,Is that correct?,44,,
196,0.97,1861.392,1871.302,"We do support it . It is not in the packet, but the whole resolution said the advisory committee needed to make a recommendation.",45,,
197,0.97,1871.302,1873.304,There is a broad advisory committee.,45,,
198,0.97,1873.304,1883.715,"The committee met in 2020, but the pandemic delayed things.",45,,
199,0.97,1883.715,1885.95,They made a recommendation to Council to adopt this.,45,,
200,0.97,1885.95,1892.657,Our Department as well as advisory committee will recommend adoption by the Council.,45,,
201,0.97,1892.657,1893.625,Okay.,46,,
202,0.97,1893.625,1897.929,Thank you.,46,,
203,0.97,1897.929,1900.164,"Calvin chow and central staff, thank you for reviewing this.",46,,
204,0.97,1900.164,1916.281,I appreciate the University of Washington . They could have approached this in many ways and they went about this with a very thorough process and also consulted a lot of community groups several months ago when they were getting started with this . I appreciate that.,46,,
205,0.97,1916.281,1924.956,Is world-class educational asset is headquartered in district for.,46,,
206,0.97,1924.956,1927.592,It has an impact on a lot of surrounding communities.,46,,
207,0.97,1927.592,1939.771,"There is a neutral interest in increasing transit for the environment and for reducing traffic congestion during big events, so I appreciate the outreach.",46,,
208,0.97,1939.771,1965.43,"My office has done additional outreach as well once the plan was finished for review and I will talk more about my amendment later . I just wanted to know if the University of Washington and Sally Clark, did you want to make any brief comments before we open it up for questions on the underlying resolution?",46,,
209,0.97,1965.43,1974.305,"Dan, Julie, and I worked this out ahead of time.",47,,
210,0.97,1974.305,1991.356,"Office of community relations have been part of the team working with Seattle Department of transportation to figure out how you voluntarily update the Tmp, which we are not sure has happened before so we are a little bit of a Guinea pig for you all.",47,,
211,0.97,1991.356,1992.824,It has taken a long time.,47,,
212,0.97,1992.824,2013.945,We took some steps and we did a protective EIS . It actually really helped us structure our outreach to groups . that was really important to be clear with community groups about the fact we were doing an update and what we are hoping to achieve with an update.,47,,
213,0.97,2013.945,2015.546,We have used that instructor to do that.,47,,
214,0.97,2015.546,2038.536,I just want to say that Sdot staff has been very helpful figuring out what a revised Tmp for Husky Stadium could do . We think it is a good plan . It is certainly in the interest of the university to have a plan we can actually use year to year more effectively.,47,,
215,0.97,2038.536,2053.818,"We can keep going with the old one . There is no requirement to update it but it seemed ridiculous to keep trying to make this 1986 plan work given climate and given the University's interest, given the neighborhood interest in mobility and safety around the Stadium.",47,,
216,0.97,2053.818,2068.232,"I really appreciate their work and given everything you have on your calendar, you are trying to move toward this and we appreciate your time on the agenda.",47,,
217,0.97,2068.232,2075.373,"We do have a couple of comments that we will share with your office in advance, so we look forward to exchanging those.",47,,
218,0.97,2075.373,2085.817,"Councilmembers, any questions about the underlying resolution and transportation management plan for Husky Stadium during big events?",48,,
219,0.97,2085.817,2098.629,"I can move the item and I can try to move my amendment and we can talk about it again, but Councilmember Strauss?",48,,
220,0.97,2098.629,2134.198,"Thank you, chair Pedersen . I will try turning on my Video but I have had some difficulty with Connectivity today, so if it starts bleeding out, I might come back . I want to highlight what Sally Clark just said about Re-Updating this plan and being a Guinea pig . It doesn't make sense to continue working on something from 1986 when we have light rail coming to Husky Stadium now . I will highlight something I said in the regional transit committee . It was not this Committee, but a County and city committee.",49,,
221,0.97,2134.198,2139.537,There was conversation about building parking structures at light rail stations Througho% t the city and throughout the region.,49,,
222,0.97,2139.537,2171.202,"If we had built a parking structure at Husky Stadium, it would not have had long-term positive impacts because as it continues to grow, we have so many more opportunities and options and ways to get people in and out of games, work, play . The Arboretum is right there near Husky Stadium . nothing further to add . I just wanted to highlight the good work of Sally Clark and all of the Stakeholders here.",49,,
223,0.97,2171.202,2171.602,Thank you.,49,,
224,0.97,2171.602,2176.607,Thank you.,50,,
225,0.97,2176.607,2180.945,"Councilmembers, any other comments?",50,,
226,0.97,2180.945,2182.747,We can Chime in later as well.,50,,
227,0.97,2182.747,2194.458,I will go ahead and move the resolution . I will move my amendment and we can talk about the specifics of the amendment and Calvin can walk us through it.,50,,
228,0.97,2194.458,2200.831,"Calvin, can you share your screen with the amendment when we are ready?",50,,
229,0.97,2200.831,2209.674,We will give the University of Washington a chance as well and the Councilmembers can confer.,50,,
230,0.97,2209.674,2220.284,"Councilmembers, I now recommend the committee move passage of resolution 32016, item 1 on our agenda.",50,,
231,0.97,2220.284,2221.085,Is there a second?,50,,
232,0.97,2221.085,2221.485,Second.,51,,
233,0.97,2221.485,2234.065,It has been moved and Seconded . I would like to move to amend resolution 32016 as presented in amendment one on the agenda . is there a second?,52,,
234,0.97,2234.065,2238.569,Second.,53,,
235,0.97,2238.569,2239.17,Thank you.,54,,
236,0.97,2239.17,2248.913,It has been moved and Seconded to consider amending the resolution as presented in item 1. I will address this item quickly and we will move to questions.,54,,
237,0.97,2248.913,2253.985,Universal action will have some comments on it.,54,,
238,0.97,2253.985,2258.689,We will turn it over just to the Councilmembers at the end of the debate here.,54,,
239,0.97,2258.689,2274.105,"Councilmembers, I believe we share a goal to make sure the city is not paying for the cost of increased traffic during sporting events . I also do not think we want to leave it Open- ended as to when the transportation management plan gets updated again.",54,,
240,0.97,2274.105,2290.955,"As shown on the agenda, item 1 would highlight the Husky Stadium transportation plan Non- automobile travel goals . We will talk about pedestrian safety, the University of Washington's responsibility for the cost.",54,,
241,0.97,2290.955,2300.331,It would also direct the technical advisory group to have it open that they would be considering setting higher Non- automobile travel mode holes.,54,,
242,0.97,2300.331,2310.274,It would also require that they submit a proposal to city council by no later than 2036.,54,,
243,0.97,2310.274,2319.55,"That is very far away, but there is no date currently, so the idea we could work this out with staff and come up with a date that would make sense.",54,,
244,0.97,2319.55,2328.159,"Breaking those general comments down into specifics here, we got a couple of amendments and recitals.",54,,
245,0.97,2328.159,2344.975,The recitals are simply lifting up what those goals are saying about the Non-Automobile goals and talking about the need to focus on pedestrian pathways.,54,,
246,0.97,2344.975,2361.492,"And then the actual sections of the resolution we would bring change, we would amend section two to basically encourage that group meeting every year on the operations plan to consider higher goals.",54,,
247,0.97,2361.492,2386.45,A lot of the benefit has already been attained through the opening of Husky Stadium light rail station . We want to have that group consider increasing the goals of Non- automobile traffic as time goes on . We would like to see more improvements later to have more people riding transit.,54,,
248,0.97,2386.45,2412.977,"If we go down to the next sections, this is also appreciative of the fact that they wrote this to say they will cover cost and this amendment would clarify including but not limited to traffic control personnel and supplemental service transit such as buses, Shuttles, and charter services if necessary.",54,,
249,0.97,2412.977,2424.855,"Section 6 is having them come back in 15 years to update the plan, or within 15 years.",54,,
250,0.97,2424.855,2429.693,Calvin and I can answer questions about the specifics.,54,,
251,0.97,2429.693,2434.865,I know the University of Washington has concerns about some of these.,54,,
252,0.97,2434.865,2456.787,"Colleagues, if you do not have immediate questions, we will hear from the University of Washington about their input on this amendment and we can just confirm amongst ourselves as trend 27 and ask Calvin chow questions . If University of Washington wants to give us their input on this now, go ahead.",54,,
253,0.97,2456.787,2458.022,Thank you very much.,54,,
254,0.97,2458.022,2459.99,Sure.,55,,
255,0.97,2459.99,2466.096,"I am in a semi-public place, so I apologize that I do not sound muffled here.",55,,
256,0.97,2466.096,2470.201,Thanks for the Opportuity to get some perspective and feedback.,55,,
257,0.97,2470.201,2476.64,It is three places where we took a look at these Monday and Tuesday morning.,55,,
258,0.97,2476.64,2483.747,"In the second whereas, the University is obviously very aware of the infrastructure needs in the northeast Seattle.",55,,
259,0.97,2483.747,2488.419,No question about it.,55,,
260,0.97,2488.419,2494.325,We have ongoing safety improvements to pedestrian areas that happen on campus and we are very aware of the work that needs to happen.,55,,
261,0.97,2494.325,2505.469,"I think our challenge is that last phrase, enhanced sidewalks near Husky Stadium.",55,,
262,0.97,2505.469,2515.179,"While that is needed, one thing we are sensitive to is where the emphasis is and that specificity . There may be projects that come along that other parties are part of.",55,,
263,0.97,2515.179,2520.284,There may be reviews of pedestrian needs.,55,,
264,0.97,2520.284,2523.954,They are outside and more urgent than the pathways.,55,,
265,0.97,2523.954,2544.074,"That whereas seems like it could land with the same impact by ending it with improve the safety of pedestrians and pedestrian pathways, which allows that openness whether it is a North/South or adjacent in another way to the area.",55,,
266,0.97,2544.074,2552.983,"Not contesting the goal of that whereas at all, but that specificity is a challenge.",55,,
267,0.97,2552.983,2559.723,The second comment we had was regarding the new section 2 down below there.,55,,
268,0.97,2559.723,2569.8,"The new section 2, if we could Scroll up a little bit that would be great.",55,,
269,0.97,2569.8,2573.537,Okay.,55,,
270,0.97,2573.537,2575.339,I don't know who's got control of the screen.,55,,
271,0.97,2575.339,2578.342,"Oh, there we go.",55,,
272,0.97,2578.342,2589.82,"So, the annual review and the technical Committee--I feel like I am skipping one.",55,,
273,0.97,2589.82,2598.462,"Yeah, to consider the goals that would be more aggressive than those that are set in the Tmp.",55,,
274,0.97,2598.462,2614.945,The Tmp is the governing document . The Tmp has been worked out and refined and negotiated with Sdot staff.,55,,
275,0.97,2614.945,2629.793,"The challenge for the University is if we are opening the door to any goals established beyond those in the Tmp, that raises the challenge that the Tmp is no longer the governing document from which we build the plant every year.",55,,
276,0.97,2629.793,2641.305,The University of course what would prefer to have that governing goal document be what we are driving towards on a regular long term basis.,55,,
277,0.97,2641.305,2662.493,"And finally, the comment regarding having the 2036 recommendation from the advisory group about whether to or about how to in this case update the Tmp . I think we would like to be open if it needs to be updated . We suggested if needed.",55,,
278,0.97,2662.493,2682.813,I am not clear about whether this requirement is present in other new Tmps that the cities adopting for other major facilities . I think honestly the University wants to be in alignment and I think we have a question about is this a new standard that the city is adopting for all?,55,,
279,0.97,2682.813,2688.118,Is it special to the University?,55,,
280,0.97,2688.118,2698.662,"Is this something we should determine together with Sdot and the University and all of the other partners at the table, whether an update is necessary?",55,,
281,0.97,2698.662,2708.439,"If that is understood in this, then it wouldn't be required and it would be run to the technical advisory if they feel it is necessary and in the best interest, then I think we are fine.",55,,
282,0.97,2708.439,2709.64,I think those are my comments.,55,,
283,0.97,2709.64,2711.141,Thank you very much.,56,,
284,0.97,2711.141,2719.049,"Calvin, did you have any questions on that? particularly on the last item . any thoughts on that?",56,,
285,0.97,2719.049,2731.095,I think the University of Washington Tmp is a very unusual animal compared to the other ones we have in the city.,57,,
286,0.97,2731.095,2743.574,"You know, most of them are established and are moving forward and ongoing.",57,,
287,0.97,2743.574,2768.098,"This one stands apart in terms of its history and where we are in updating it . I think that the idea behind the section 6 language did sort of incorporate the idea that the technical advisory would comply if it was a good idea, although not necessarily explicit.",57,,
288,0.97,2768.098,2783.046,"That may be a distinction without much meaning if it comes to it, but it may be important to specify what your expectations are for how the technical advisory group approaches that issue.",57,,
289,0.97,2783.046,2812.943,"I think we are pointing out how, you know, it is amazing that the 1986 version has been in place for so long and giving it a large runway of 15 years, I think I am fine with the way the amendment is written . As is trend 27, any questions or comments about the amendment?",58,,
290,0.97,2812.943,2817.481,"Yes, Council President Gonzalez?",58,,
291,0.97,2817.481,2819.183,"Thank you so much, chair Pedersen.",59,,
292,0.97,2819.183,2854.384,I think I have heard Sally's message around feeling that there was not certainty here . I guess I am just asking for a little bit more explanation around why this particular language or what part of this language is causing concerns vagueness in the reading . Ing,59,,
293,0.97,2854.384,2863.393,Is it okay if we ask you to answer the question?,60,,
294,0.97,2863.393,2867.598,I am happy to answer it.,60,,
295,0.97,2867.598,2873.537,Are you talking about the last section about 2036?,61,,
296,0.97,2873.537,2879.243,I am trying to get a sense.,62,,
297,0.97,2879.243,2884.248,And to tell me if I'm out of order.,62,,
298,0.97,2884.248,2893.657,"It is okay . at some point, it will just be us but if you have a direct question, let's ask them for sure.",63,,
299,0.97,2893.657,2899.963,"Sally, I thought I heard you say there was something in the amendment that created a lack of certainty or vagueness.",64,,
300,0.97,2899.963,2906.236,I apologize for my question to begin with.,64,,
301,0.97,2906.236,2926.757,"I am getting over a head cold and it is making me less articulate . I would like to get a clear sense of what the University of Washington believes is not clear, or is Muddying the waters in a different way in this amendment . I think it is important to get a better understanding of that.",64,,
302,0.97,2926.757,2927.157,Sure.,65,,
303,0.97,2927.157,2929.159,I can give this a quick try.,65,,
304,0.97,2929.159,2937.634,"I understand you all, or we want to be part of the discussion.",65,,
305,0.97,2937.634,2941.772,There are three parts of Councilman Pedersen's practice.,65,,
306,0.97,2941.772,2947.878,The first is North and south of the Stadium . that certainly came up in public feedback when we were doing community conversations.,65,,
307,0.97,2947.878,2963.527,I think we want to make sure we are not leaving it implicit that Husky Stadium activities are necessarily the only thing that contributes to the need for interest her in the greater area.,65,,
308,0.97,2963.527,2972.202,The second one I think is maybe where the vagueness or the uncertainty is more of an issue for us.,65,,
309,0.97,2972.202,2984.047,"That is the goals for mobility, what percentage of automobiles, what percentage of pedestrians, what percentage of bikes?",65,,
310,0.97,2984.047,2988.518,"Really we made it into two buckets, auto and non-auto.",65,,
311,0.97,2988.518,3014.845,"Those goals are set in the Tmp as a governing document with goals that get tougher for the university to meet every time a length of light rail opens up, which is as it should be . We should continue to work as hard as we can every year whether the light rail is opening up or not to minimize the numbers coming to the Stadium.",65,,
312,0.97,3014.845,3024.988,"This says a technical advisory committee, would you consider some other goals that are beyond what has already been set in the Tmp?",65,,
313,0.97,3024.988,3051.481,"That gives me and the University some qualms about Okay, I thought we understood what the boundaries were about those could be beyond what are set out for us in the Tmp, around which we will make plans and build budgets and figure out how to achieve those on the multi-year basis, as light rail continues to open and beyond that.",65,,
314,0.97,3051.481,3063.193,We need to continue to drive down automobile numbers . The vagueness and uncertainty of what could be expected of athletics and the University is mostly wrapped up in that second one.,65,,
315,0.97,3063.193,3063.693,Audit.,66,,
316,0.97,3063.693,3071.935,That is helpful . I will shift it back to staff now.,66,,
317,0.97,3071.935,3111.374,"Calvin, help me understand the last point around the proposed amendment in section 2. you know, help me sort of understand the implementation of this from the transportation management plan perspective . If we have this technical advisory group and they do establish or recommend, I suppose, more aggressive goals than are currently established in what will soon be an adopted Tmp.",66,,
318,0.97,3111.374,3119.749,"How does that--how does that--I mean, do the recommendations need to come back to the Council?",66,,
319,0.97,3119.749,3126.89,Is it actually possible for those things to be automatically incorporated into the operations plan?,66,,
320,0.97,3126.89,3138.802,"The advisory group APPROVES the plan without future Council approval, so this is delegating to that body . does the proposed plan makes sense?",67,,
321,0.97,3138.802,3171.501,"I think the intent of this proposed amendment is to say that the Tmp goals are essentially before . I think this is sort of attended to consider a situation where if we demonstrate one year we are significantly beating the goals, then that should be sort of a way we move forward . You know, that is kind of the situation we are in now quite frankly.",67,,
322,0.97,3171.501,3174.604,It is much better than the 1986 Tmp proposal.,67,,
323,0.97,3174.604,3184.714,"You know, it does leave it basically up to the advisory group to interpret what that means.",67,,
324,0.97,3184.714,3193.657,"In some ways, that sort of authority is always delegated to this structure that the resolution establishes.",67,,
325,0.97,3193.657,3211.141,So the structure we are talking about here in terms of the technical advisory group and this exercise of let's say reevaluation based on progress of meeting the goals is not an extraordinary process?,68,,
326,0.97,3211.141,3220.116,It is really emphasizing the role that the technical advisory group plays in improving the goal and reviewing past performance.,69,,
327,0.97,3220.116,3236.566,"It is explicit in saying should that be more aggressive than what we have, what would be adopted here? I think in terms of the authority, it is the same that the central advisory group would have.",69,,
328,0.97,3236.566,3236.967,Okay.,70,,
329,0.97,3236.967,3241.605,It is not modifying the scope of the advisory group?,70,,
330,0.97,3241.605,3243.373,I don't believe so.,71,,
331,0.97,3243.373,3243.873,Okay.,72,,
332,0.97,3243.873,3259.823,"One last question, does--is there other language in the Tmp that describes the goals as the minimum as opposed to the maximum?",72,,
333,0.97,3259.823,3269.032,I don't know that it is called out that way.,73,,
334,0.97,3269.032,3287.517,I think it is important for us to recognize that all of our data information really comes based off of attendees survey that happens once a year or twice a year . There is a certain amount of lack of precision that I think is important to recognize.,73,,
335,0.97,3287.517,3290.954,It is not like we are counting absolutely every thing.,73,,
336,0.97,3290.954,3298.261,It is supposed to be kind of a guide that we sink to overtime.,73,,
337,0.97,3298.261,3314.544,"I know when I looked at some of the history of how it Udub has accomplished this, that can be based on was it raining today that game was taking place?",73,,
338,0.97,3314.544,3316.746,I don't want us to read too much into the targets.,73,,
339,0.97,3316.746,3319.582,They are meant to be goals.,73,,
340,0.97,3319.582,3356.386,"They are meant to be guiding principles to help focus the development of an annual operations plan is . I think in that context, I think that is in there with the Tmp . I don't know if it is necessarily explicit about always striving for the highest, but that is largely why I think the University has come back to ask to update this . It is hard to talk with surrounding neighborhoods about the requirements when it is something we have been regularly exceeding for the past 20 years.",73,,
341,0.97,3356.386,3356.786,Yeah.,74,,
342,0.97,3356.786,3368.398,"Thank you, Calvin, for that additional information.",74,,
343,0.97,3368.398,3376.106,"I think it is important to have this on the record, some of those points that you just made so I appreciate the opportunity to do that.",74,,
344,0.97,3376.106,3379.709,I will turn it over to chair Pedersen.,74,,
345,0.97,3379.709,3385.014,"The reason I'm comfortable with this language, it says it will consider whether to do it.",75,,
346,0.97,3385.014,3397.427,It is highlighting that we want to strive for more and more transit as time goes on and didn't want to just Bake it in.,75,,
347,0.97,3397.427,3399.362,We want to strive for more transit.,75,,
348,0.97,3399.362,3401.464,Councilmember Herbold?,75,,
349,0.97,3401.464,3402.065,Thank you.,76,,
350,0.97,3402.065,3403.933,I was going to basically make the same point.,76,,
351,0.97,3403.933,3417.747,Inherent in this language as I see it is that the advisory group could determine that more aggressive goals are not warranted.,76,,
352,0.97,3417.747,3427.457,"That is sort of inherent in their role and in the ""will consider"" language.",76,,
353,0.97,3427.457,3433.563,They could consider and they could determine that more aggressive goals are not warranted.,76,,
354,0.97,3433.563,3443.94,That is how I am more reading it and I just wanted to put it on the record that that is how I am reading this language as well.,76,,
355,0.97,3443.94,3477.841,"The other concerns we have heard from University of Washington as it relates specifically to perhaps too much specificity in the second proposed new recital, interested to know, chair Pedersen, if you are open to striking the language including enhanced sidewalks North and south of Husky Stadium, and whether or not you would consider that to your amendment.",76,,
356,0.97,3477.841,3479.142,Thank you.,77,,
357,0.97,3479.142,3487.417,This came from a lot of comments from the community groups.,77,,
358,0.97,3487.417,3489.752,We were hearing from the teams on pedestrian safety and sidewalks.,77,,
359,0.97,3489.752,3495.692,That was said over and over . I appreciate the feedback from the University of Washington as well.,77,,
360,0.97,3495.692,3519.048,Maybe the way of handling does is to change the language here so it is not as specific to say something like--it currently says enhanced sidewalks North and south of Husky Stadium . I would be interested in changing that to which could include enhanced ends to sidewalks near Husky Stadium.,77,,
361,0.97,3519.048,3522.352,"Again, it would say which could include enhancements to sidewalks near Husky Stadium.",77,,
362,0.97,3522.352,3530.059,"It is not anything specific about North or South, even though that was the comment we got from community groups.",77,,
363,0.97,3530.059,3548.111,"It would use the word ""near"" and it would say, ""could include ."" and again, for perspective to the millions of people listening into this conversation today, it is a recital and a resolution.",77,,
364,0.97,3548.111,3564.594,"Would that work for colleagues to modify or soft in this language and instead of saying enclosed sidewalks, we could take including enhancements to sidewalks near Husky Stadium.",77,,
365,0.97,3564.594,3577.14,"In which case, I can go ahead and incorporate that into an amendment . So then I will go ahead and move that.",77,,
366,0.97,3577.14,3605.435,"There is a motion on the table to amend resolution one . I will jump on top of that motion and moved to amend amendment one by revising the last clause, second proposed recital by replacing the words enhanced sidewalks North and south of Husky Stadium, which could include sidewalks near Husky Stadium.",77,,
367,0.97,3605.435,3611.04,Is there a second?,77,,
368,0.97,3611.04,3613.142,Second.,78,,

507,0.97,4385.614,4399.762,I think Sdot has a presentation on this . I would like to remind the Council that one of the conditions for developing terminal 5 was that the port and Sdot seek a quiet tone here.,164,,
508,0.97,4399.762,4403.665,This is legislation that would support that effort.,164,,
509,0.97,4403.665,4405.734,Thank you.,165,,
510,0.97,4405.734,4418.08,"Welcome again, Sdot, Jason and Jon . Hi.",165,,

512,0.97,4421.483,4430.292,I am Jon Layzer and I am here today seeking authorization related to property acquisition for this important project.,166,,
513,0.97,4430.292,4454.483,"Sdot frequently ACQUIRES property for capital projects and we typically do that under the authorization with the approval of the capital improvement program .

516,0.97,4484.913,4485.314,Thank you.,166,,
517,0.97,4485.314,4486.448,"Next slide, please.",166,,
518,0.97,4486.448,4509.538,Jason will talk through a little background on what a railroad quiet zone is and the background of the specific terminal 5 quiet zone . We will provide additional information on the project at health and the acquisition that we are in the process of negotiating.,166,,
519,0.97,4509.538,4512.941,We will complete the project and finalize the quiet zone.,166,,

521,0.97,4516.645,4522.284,"Thank you, Jon . Thanks to everyone for having me.",167,,
522,0.97,4522.284,4524.753,My name is Jason Fialkoff.,167,,
523,0.97,4524.753,4548.51,"Just before we get into the details, I wanted to make sure that everybody had a basic understanding of what a railroad quiet zone is . It is a segment of rail corridor where trains essentially do not have to Toot their whistles . We are able to implement quiet zones by making access improvements and safety improvements.",167,,
524,0.97,4548.51,4561.123,"There might be instances where the trains Toot their whistles in emergency situations or other regulations, but a quiet zone mitigates noise . next slide, please.",167,,
525,0.97,4561.123,4567.529,This slide indicates the Timeline of the terminal 5 quiet zone project.,167,,
526,0.97,4567.529,4598.86,"As Calvin mentioned earlier, the port of Seattle has modernized terminal 5 through their environmental impact statement process . They have identified noise impact to the adjacent community . The modernization for terminal 5 indicated the quiet zone . We have been coordinating with the port since 2017 to plan, design, and eventually implement that quiet zone.",167,,
527,0.97,4598.86,4615.277,Outreach began a few years ago as well as design and we are at the point where we are wrapping up design this year and anticipating starting construction next year after the West Seattle bridge repair work is complete.,167,,
528,0.97,4615.277,4621.65,We are expecting 10 months for construction of the quiet zone.,167,,
529,0.97,4621.65,4623.452,Councilmember Herbold?,168,,
530,0.97,4623.452,4624.886,Thank you so much.,169,,
531,0.97,4624.886,4636.064,"I just want to emphasize that--actually, can you put that slide back up?",169,,
532,0.97,4636.064,4676.705,Is does not require that the quiet zone be operational . It requires a level of understanding with the port be signed . I know a lot of folks in district 1 have concerns with where we are in this stage of negotiations around the quiet zone . I want to recognize as we heard in public comment the original eight for the establishment of the quiet zone was December of 2020.,169,,
533,0.97,4676.705,4729.291,"We are, indeed, behind . We are still aligned with the requirements . I want to also just recognize the work that Sdot and the port have been doing on this project and recognize that the delays are related to the efforts of Sdot and the port in negotiating with the business tenants around the design of the quiet zone . their extensive efforts for outstanding concerns of the tenant.",169,,
534,0.97,4729.291,4740.268,I appreciate those efforts and appreciate the underlying reason for the delay.,169,,
535,0.97,4740.268,4757.919,"I also want to recognize that there are significant impacts to folks who live in the area quite far from the area, actually.",169,,
536,0.97,4757.919,4764.526,The sound does carry and I am hoping we can move this forward today.,169,,
537,0.97,4764.526,4769.231,"You know, I appreciate the history and the background.",169,,
538,0.97,4769.231,4810.939,"I want to also NOTE because I have worked with constituents to do this that one of my first budget actions as Councilmember was the development of a statement of legislative intent in my first year in office requesting Sdot work with the port of Seattle, the Federal where way administration and the railway company to extend the quiet zone from Termina 5 to the Dell Bridgeway . that was in 2016.",169,,
539,0.97,4810.939,4815.377,I appreciate everything that has been taken to get us to the point we are at now.,169,,
540,0.97,4815.377,4815.644,Thanks.,169,,
541,0.97,4815.644,4817.045,Thank you.,170,,
542,0.97,4817.045,4821.149,It is always important.,170,,
543,0.97,4821.149,4827.923,"All of the work the District has done, it is important to highlight so thank you for that.",170,,
544,0.97,4827.923,4838.767,"Knowing that you have not only helped to get this moving, but he would like to keep it moving, that is very helpful to us, so thank you.",170,,
545,0.97,4838.767,4840.969,"Jason, please continue.",170,,
546,0.97,4840.969,4846.474,Thank you for that . I think that was well said.,171,,
547,0.97,4846.474,4853.615,So here you can see the scope of the terminal five quiet zone project.,171,,
548,0.97,4853.615,4872.5,"The quiet zone begins on the Westside and continues along West marginal way to marginal place Southwest . It is about a half mile segment . again, we are mitigating rail noise through a safety enhanced and and minor similar improvements.",171,,
549,0.97,4872.5,4892.821,"This is a project we are delivering on behalf of and as indicated earlier, the item on our critical path that is potentially the most Impactful schedule is property acquisition of a small piece of property needed to implement the project.",171,,
550,0.97,4892.821,4896.057,"Next slide, please?",171,,
551,0.97,4896.057,4911.273,"This shows a little more detail of the quiet zone, the project impacts five different railroad crossings in the area.",171,,
552,0.97,4911.273,4921.249,The project will convert the North intersection to an emergency vehicle crossing only.,171,,
553,0.97,4921.249,4942.57,"Crossings to and for our private driveways we have proposed consolidating to cross free, which we are proposing widening and adding a traffic signal and finally crossing five is another driveway we are converting to one-way Inbound.",171,,
554,0.97,4942.57,4973.268,"These recommendations come out of a safety diagnostic meeting that is the Federal railroad administration, the port, Sdot, and those recommendations are pretty clearly spelled out in the Federal regulation . that is to say that we do not have a lot of flexibility in terms of what kind of improvements we can make at these crossings.",171,,
555,0.97,4973.268,4975.704,"Next slide, please.",171,,
556,0.97,4975.704,5000.261,"So in order to widen crossing three and at a signal, we need to acquire a small piece of property . outreach to the impacted business owners began in 2018 and we have made those initial property offers to Riverside mill earlier this year.",171,,
557,0.97,5000.261,5006.134,"Since then, negotiations have stalled without this property acquisition.",171,,
558,0.97,5006.134,5018.947,"I think as most of us are aware, we are here today requesting the Council improve legislation so we can acquire the property necessary to keep the project moving.",171,,
559,0.97,5018.947,5020.749,"Next slide, please.",171,,
560,0.97,5020.749,5027.288,So this area zooms in a little more on the property.,171,,
561,0.97,5027.288,5038.666,You can see the lower Spokane swing bridge go over crossing three . property is outlined in red.,171,,
562,0.97,5038.666,5072.7,The blue area in the top left corner is the property that we need to widen the crossing and allow trucks to continue to enter and exit onto the public street that provides access to some of the other property owners adjacent to the property . An easement is needed in order to install a Chain-Link fence along the rail line.,171,,
563,0.97,5072.7,5079.507,Not a huge piece of property in terms of the larger property.,171,,
564,0.97,5079.507,5082.644,If you could leave that up to a moment.,172,,
565,0.97,5082.644,5097.525,Obviously to provide an option for condemnation is a serious thing for the city government to do and I want to be careful about this.,172,,
566,0.97,5097.525,5099.828,This map is really important.,172,,
567,0.97,5099.828,5108.736,"To me, this showing it is that light blue portion we are talking about.",172,,
568,0.97,5108.736,5116.377,The property owner you are working with owns that entire read boundary there.,172,,
569,0.97,5116.377,5116.678,Correct?,172,,
570,0.97,5116.678,5118.48,Okay.,172,,
571,0.97,5118.48,5120.081,That is correct.,173,,
572,0.97,5120.081,5123.751,Thank you.,174,,
573,0.97,5123.751,5132.894,I believe the property acquisition is about 3000 square feet and it is only the property adjacent to where we will widen the crossing.,175,,
574,0.97,5132.894,5133.695,Thank you.,176,,
575,0.97,5133.695,5137.499,That is helpful.,176,,
576,0.97,5137.499,5144.672,"Councilmember Herbold, your electronic hand is raised.",176,,
577,0.97,5144.672,5145.974,Is that from the previous thing?,176,,
578,0.97,5145.974,5146.174,Okay.,176,,
579,0.97,5146.174,5146.508,Thank you.,176,,
580,0.97,5146.508,5147.675,"Go ahead, Jason.",176,,
581,0.97,5147.675,5152.013,"Great . As I mentioned earlier, negotiations have stalled.",177,,
582,0.97,5152.013,5170.899,"The property owner has concerns about the changes to property access, which this slide indicates here . going from the top, I want to kind of illustrate what it will continue to be as well as what has changed.",177,,
583,0.97,5170.899,5178.606,"On the North, there is a city street that we commonly refer to as a local business access road.",177,,
584,0.97,5178.606,5192.02,"Sdot has improved this over the past year as well as improved the terminal 5 access bridge, which provides access to the Spokane swing bridge.",177,,
585,0.97,5192.02,5198.927,That access will remain and has been improved . below it is what I have been calling crossing three.,177,,
586,0.97,5198.927,5205.433,It is the rail crossing that we are planning to widen.,177,,
587,0.97,5205.433,5209.437,We will add a signal to provide Inbound and outbound access.,177,,
588,0.97,5209.437,5229.591,Below it is the private driveway that we are consolidating and at the bottom of the image is the other private driveway that we are planning to convert from two way access to one-way Inbound access.,177,,
589,0.97,5229.591,5233.394,"Next slide, please.",177,,
590,0.97,5233.394,5248.876,So I think a lot of are interested in what is remaining in order to get from here to final implementation of the project as well as establishment of the quiet zone.,177,,
591,0.97,5248.876,5264.158,"First and foremost, the property acquisition followed by compiling the final document going to advertisement . After that construction, there are a few things that impact construction.",177,,
592,0.97,5264.158,5286.047,"We are anticipating starting in the third quarter, so probably the late summer with an impact to West marginal way in order to implement the new signal . We expect to complete the project in the second quarter of 2023.",177,,
593,0.97,5286.047,5293.354,"This schedule is our best estimate right now, but it is reliant on a few things, namely the successful property acquisition.",177,,
594,0.97,5293.354,5303.931,We are continuing to negotiate our final agreements with the Federal railroad administration.,177,,
595,0.97,5303.931,5311.239,"We are pretty close, but we move at the pace of the rail.",177,,
596,0.97,5311.239,5315.343,Finally the completion of the West Seattle bridge repair project.,177,,
597,0.97,5315.343,5331.159,"Once that has been completed, we can then file the no known notice establishment . that is a process that is mailed out to the impacted Stakeholders.",177,,
598,0.97,5331.159,5344.172,"There is a 50 day comment period and once it has established and completed, the quiet zone can be established and we can begin mitigating rail noise.",177,,
599,0.97,5344.172,5350.878,That is my presentation for today . are there any questions?,177,,
600,0.97,5350.878,5358.119,Thank you very much.,178,,
601,0.97,5358.119,5361.823,I support passing this to the committee today.,178,,
602,0.97,5361.823,5380.308,"Because there is so much time between the committee meeting in the next Council on temper 13, this does enable us to be out in the public realm longer than usual, which is a good thing . Calvin, are there any comments or anything you want to add?",178,,
603,0.97,5380.308,5382.51,I have nothing to add right now.,179,,

625,0.97,5483.11,5502.363,"This would accept various grants totaling $40.5 million including grant for the West Seattle bridge, PS RC grant for 15th Avenue South and pedestrian safety for Aurora Avenue North.",194,,
626,0.97,5502.363,5507.201,"I am happy to turn it over to Sdot . Calvin, did you have any opening remarks?",194,,
627,0.97,5507.201,5529.724,There are budget appropriations being requested for the 15th Avenue South and Aurora Avenue projects . The West Seattle bridge project has significant already for the budget . transportation funding often comes on with pretty prescribed Timelines.,195,,
628,0.97,5529.724,5546.073,"While most of our other grants from other departments, these ave to be handled outside that process to be on the Timelines of the grant agencies.",195,,

634,0.97,5583.844,5597.425,"Next slide . all right, so as Calvin mentioned, we are in this funny in between period and leading up to key three.",199,,
635,0.97,5597.425,5613.474,This is largely do to as Calvin mentioned the requirements of the grant Timeline . This really centers around our need to operate the grant before the repair goes out for construction.,199,,
636,0.97,5613.474,5626.954,"For 15th Avenue, which is currently under construction and Aurora Avenue, which they need to keep the project on schedule.",199,,
637,0.97,5626.954,5654.982,This is a great opportunity and it starts putting together plans for us to be able to and through future grant opportunities to be able to construct any sort of projects that may result as part of this planning opportunity with Aurora Avenue . next slide?,199,,
638,0.97,5654.982,5666.494,"Real quickly, we received $11.6 million and $12 million via their local bridge funding.",199,,
639,0.97,5666.494,5717.678,"This is pretty exciting news and I am happy to share that this brings us up to $37.7 million to support the construction for the West Seattle bridge . I am pretty proud of the efforts of the grant team to be able to put this package together this brings us to 70% of the funding . Additionally, just a quick update on the project . We are at a 60% design update . We are continuing to work on a contract with our consulting firm in order to get that to 100% design and also working on early work packages for the project that includes listed items that are being covered.",199,,

643,0.97,5736.163,5757.918,"This is a paving project . the part of the project receiving the grant, this went through a process with the regional Council where we had already received $1.4 million in grant funds for this and the project is underway and in construction right now.",200,,
644,0.97,5757.918,5778.038,"There is a surplus process where if they receive any extra funds from the Federal Government, they look to distribute them to projects that have already gone through the scoring process and that might be in construction.",200,,
645,0.97,5778.038,5789.216,"15th Avenue South ended up being on that list . We were able to accept an additional $750,000 to contribute toward the package.",200,,
646,0.97,5789.216,5794.321,That is just a project that was already in construction.,200,,
647,0.97,5794.321,5802.53,This is additional money to Sdot that will have less local spend on it . We could say potentially for other uses.,200,,
648,0.97,5802.53,5806.267,Next slide.,200,,
649,0.97,5806.267,5815.843,The Aurora Avenue North planning was a competitive process in the state pedestrian safety program.,200,,
650,0.97,5815.843,5818.045,This is key to note this is for planning work.,200,,
651,0.97,5818.045,5835.963,The Timeline we want to get going in fall and analysis starting in 2022. the reason that is coming today for appropriation and acceptance is to get the important work started as quickly as possible.,200,,
652,0.97,5835.963,5853.18,"That will be nice . It is hard to say how things will work out with future funding packages, but there is a lot going on at the Federal level about large infrastructure . The earlier we can do our planning, the better prepared we are for future opportunities.",200,,
653,0.97,5853.18,5871.699,"Next slide, please . So in summary, this grant acceptance has four acceptances for the West Seattle bridge and those two for 15th and Aurora Avenue.",200,,
654,0.97,5871.699,5876.136,The amount we are accepting is just over $40 million.,200,,
655,0.97,5876.136,5888.549,"Something to note here, the port of Seattle and King County, those are still active and we are working closely with our partners there to make sure it is productive.",200,,
656,0.97,5888.549,5898.058,Those amounts we are asking you to accept the grant in advance of us actually having it finalized.,200,,
657,0.97,5898.058,5903.163,Those are up to $10 million and up to $5 million for those amounts.,200,,
658,0.97,5903.163,5914.942,"If we have this acceptance in hand, it will make it even quicker and faster to apply that funding to the project.",200,,
659,0.97,5914.942,5922.049,We continue to move very quickly on the West Seattle bridge.,200,,

664,0.97,5936.263,5953.48,"I am curious whether or not the contributions from the port and the county are dedicated to specific project elements, or is it general to the whole project?",202,,
665,0.97,5953.48,5960.821,We are having productive conversations but they are not final yet.,203,,
666,0.97,5960.821,5963.724,"Once we do have those, we would be happy to share them with you.",203,,

713,0.97,6196.256,6210.47,"This is a very forward piece of work . We have been moving this forward in close collaboration with customers and across the utility, so we are very happy to be here and share with you.",228,,
714,0.97,6210.47,6213.273,We have provided information in the past.,228,,
715,0.97,6213.273,6217.177,Scott Cooper will be our chief guy on the ground.,228,,
716,0.97,6217.177,6223.083,He will be providing all of the details.,228,,
717,0.97,6223.083,6231.658,"We have Robert Cromwell, who is in charge of our customer energy solutions . He is here as well to answer questions.",228,,
718,0.97,6231.658,6247.274,"As I said, this is an important day and an important program for the city in many ways . It is responsive to and in response to a direct ask from some of our largest customers.",228,,
719,0.97,6247.274,6254.514,It will impact our portfolio and will allow us to continue diversifying our resource mix.,228,,
720,0.97,6254.514,6260.287,It is consistent with directions for the city.,228,,
721,0.97,6260.287,6279.74,"It is a piece of the puzzle that will continue to move us forward toward being a greener Seattle and reducing our carbon base . with that, I will turn things over to Scott . The rest of us are here to just Chime in and provide support, so thank you so much.",228,,
722,0.97,6279.74,6281.608,"Thank you, Deborah.",229,,
723,0.97,6281.608,6285.812,You want to get the slide going there?,229,,
724,0.97,6285.812,6287.447,Great.,229,,
725,0.97,6287.447,6317.944,"Again, my name is Scott Cooper with Seattle city light . As Deborah said, I am the lead on the program design and have been for the past 10 or 12 months or so . I will give you an interview of what this is . We will discuss why we are doing it and get a little bit of details on how the program is set up and how it works.",229,,
726,0.97,6317.944,6319.746,If you could move to the next slide there.,229,,
727,0.97,6319.746,6323.25,This is the renewable plus program.,229,,
728,0.97,6323.25,6326.653,There are two pieces to this effectively.,229,,
729,0.97,6326.653,6354.881,"Number one, this program will allow us, city light, to integrate new renewable energy resources and integrate them into our energy mix . The other piece is that we will be contracting with customers to have their subscribed load that they have signed up for covered by the renewable resource.",229,,
730,0.97,6354.881,6359.386,"So, why is it that we are seeking this program?",229,,
731,0.97,6359.386,6380.707,"We have heard from a number of our large commercial customers that have aggressive and specific Sustainability goals that while they are satisfied and happy with their energy that we offer, they are looking for more and different offerings than what we have.",229,,
732,0.97,6380.707,6392.919,"This is really an effort for us, city light, to be responsive to those big and important customers that we are serving to meet their Sustainability goals and needs.",229,,
733,0.97,6392.919,6409.936,"Beyond the customer piece, as Deborah mentioned earlier, this is an opportunity for us at City light to go out and integrate a new renewable resource into our energy portfolio.",229,,
734,0.97,6409.936,6417.444,This would be a development that wouldn't occur otherwise.,229,,
735,0.97,6417.444,6465.792,"This is really an opportunity for us to be forward thinking and get ahead of this . The third last point there to highlight the city light, kind of the middleman for Sustainability goals they will connect the deaths and be the middleman and make the connection between the customers . for customers that have these Sustainability goals, they're looking to partner with us, city light . We are happy to be in the decision to help smooth that out.",229,,
736,0.97,6465.792,6468.395,Next slide?,229,,
737,0.97,6468.395,6481.908,"So what this ordinance is and what it does, there are two main pieces . This will establish the renewable plus program and the second piece is focused on contract authority.",229,,
738,0.97,6481.908,6519.779,"This will provide city light with the authority to contract 28. one with the renewable energy partners through a power purchase agreements, and two, customers seeking to participate in the program . a couple things to note on that . City light currently has a five year contract and authority to capitalize these big projects that renewable energy develops are looking for.",229,,
739,0.97,6519.779,6552.979,"Need the authority to work with those developers . on the customer side, we are working on matching the customer agreement with the power source agreement to help capitalize the renewable energy agreement and make sure that we are passing along the benefits from the customers to help pay for the contract we will be signing up for for this resource.",229,,
740,0.97,6552.979,6558.018,"Last thing, sorry.",229,,
741,0.97,6558.018,6565.892,This is only for the renewable plus program . This does not apply broadly to any other business.,229,,
742,0.97,6565.892,6579.906,Next slide . So I will jump in a bit into the specifics of the program design and what it is and how it works.,229,,
743,0.97,6579.906,6600.927,"This is city light seeking to contract for brand-new renewable resources, like wind or solar in the Pacific Northwest and implement those into the city light portfolio . The energy will be transmitted back to city light's load.",229,,
744,0.97,6600.927,6623.383,"The new piece is really important for us and our customers . They want to demonstrate, our customers, that they are having a 1 to 1 impact in the Pacific Northwest . We are limited with the scope in the Pacific Northwest.",229,,
745,0.97,6623.383,6634.194,The second piece there is targeting our large commercial customers that have large aggressive Sustainability goals . We have talked with our unit.,229,,
746,0.97,6634.194,6667.293,We have talked with a lot of large customers that are keen on this type of program . really a bedrock for this is us being very careful and thoughtful on how we designed this program to avoid shifting costs to Nonparticipants and to make sure there is no bleed over for the cost of this program to customers that are not participating in the program . I will cover that a little later as well.,229,,
747,0.97,6667.293,6680.707,"The product that we will be Transacting with for customers that participate in this program, this is called bundled energy . There are two pieces to this.",229,,
748,0.97,6680.707,6694.32,Participating customers are seeking to as I said really prove their participation in this program and is tying directly to the new resource.,229,,
749,0.97,6694.32,6701.027,This energy will be delivered to city light load.,229,,
750,0.97,6701.027,6710.97,"And two, the renewable energy certificates, these are the green attributes that come with the resource.",229,,
751,0.97,6710.97,6720.747,That is part of what we are delivering to the customers.,229,,
752,0.97,6720.747,6729.456,This is the means by which we transact with participating customers on this program.,229,,
753,0.97,6729.456,6736.763,The participating customers will have an additional charge on top of their base rate from participation with the program.,229,,
754,0.97,6736.763,6742.669,This is not going to change or affect their normal bills in any way.,229,,
755,0.97,6742.669,6756.282,This is on top of what they are already paying for the subscribed load they have chosen to participate with this program . The last bullet here ties up with Nonparticipants.,229,,
756,0.97,6756.282,6792.218,"Our program team has taken a really careful look at this using our integrated resource plan to analyze exactly what we expect the program and the cost and benefits to be to sort out what the cost of the program will be and to pass the incremental costs through participating customers . next slide . so on the customer front, we are targeting larger customers with this program.",229,,
757,0.97,6792.218,6804.23,We have done outreach to all of the customers we have identified to have a large annual load.,229,,
758,0.97,6804.23,6840.233,That is on the order of 60 or 70 customers that fit that minimum threshold . There is a smaller Subset of customers we have had an ongoing dialogue with that are interested in learning more about the program that have Sustainability goals that this may help meet . We have presentations from a number of customers and a back and forth dialogue to work on the program to make sure that this program will fit their Neds as well as their own.,229,,
759,0.97,6840.233,6852.178,Ultimately this is part of the authority we are seeking through the ordinance here.,229,,
760,0.97,6852.178,6861.421,This is a long-term agreement for this program for likely tend to 15 years to commit to participating in this program.,229,,
761,0.97,6861.421,6864.991,"Deborah, I see you popping up.",229,,
762,0.97,6864.991,6868.127,Is there anything you would like to add?,229,,
763,0.97,6868.127,6906.566,"Late last year we released a request for project proposals and we got a really robust response, which was great to see . We saw 30 to 35 responses from developers in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana . We have an evaluation framework we are using to Whittle that down, given the restraint of the program and customer related.",230,,
764,0.97,6906.566,6910.637,We are working down the short list.,230,,
765,0.97,6910.637,6912.272,It is located in Eastern Washington and Oregon.,230,,
766,0.97,6912.272,6915.875,All of these projects are Brand- new.,230,,
767,0.97,6915.875,6926.085,The developers have done their permanent due diligence and have set the table for the development of these projects.,230,,
768,0.97,6926.085,6934.961,They are seeking contracts with off takers.,230,,
769,0.97,6934.961,6985.411,"We have as I mentioned evaluated these projects based on program requirements . I want to make sure the equity analysis, we've taken a close look at that and have incorporated it into our framework and what might be the impacts of such a program and what that resource would be . We are evaluating these projects based on the criteria such as the workforce jobs impact communities in which these resources would be based . He could be operations or the type of committee outreach benefit and they would potentially be based as well.",230,,
770,0.97,6985.411,6987.613,That is part of our framework.,230,,
771,0.97,6987.613,6991.117,Next slide.,230,,
772,0.97,6991.117,6999.359,"Almost wrapping up, I wanted to reiterate the value of this program for our participating customers.",230,,
773,0.97,6999.359,7010.57,This is a product and program that will help them meet Sustainability goals and many of them would have trouble without partnership.,230,,
774,0.97,7010.57,7028.888,"We have heard from these customers that are interested in this type of program, they are keen to demonstrating partnership . that really Aligns with the values for city light as well.",230,,
775,0.97,7028.888,7037.797,"On the city light front for us, this is an opportunity for us, city light, to respond to the changing energy market.",230,,
776,0.97,7037.797,7043.903,Some of our bigger customers are getting more sophisticated in energy needs and goals.,230,,
777,0.97,7043.903,7049.175,Frankly we are being pushed to do more and do better by them.,230,,
778,0.97,7049.175,7055.681,This is an opportunity for us to adapt and be responsive to our customer needs.,230,,
779,0.97,7055.681,7080.606,"As I mentioned, we are taking a close look at the program and how it will affect our resiliency . We will analyze this ahead of when we would have otherwise in the absence of a program like this.",230,,
780,0.97,7080.606,7093.119,"And Lastly, this was an opportunity for us to demonstrate regional leadership and the development of renewable energy here in the Pacific Northwest.",230,,

782,0.97,7097.323,7100.526,I wanted to touch on the Timeline here.,230,,
783,0.97,7100.526,7107.066,The first few lines are the work we have done.,230,,
784,0.97,7107.066,7119.045,"Doing the program design, the rate design, evaluation and selection of the potential resource for the program, there are Bolded items right there.",230,,
785,0.97,7119.045,7140.166,"We are here today with the briefing . As Councilmember Pedersen mentioned, there will be a vote on the 15th and the Council will put this on September 20th.",230,,
786,0.97,7140.166,7163.155,"Following that, we will be moving into contracting the resource and contracting with customers for this program . As I mentioned, because this is a new renewable resource",230,,
787,0.97,7163.456,7170.229,It depends on the specific resources selected.,231,,
788,0.97,7170.229,7195.054,"One thing I want to highlight, the last Bolded item is referring back to the program rates . As you know, we come to city Council to establish our rates and we will establish a new rate for this program . We are not seeking to do this now.",231,,
789,0.97,7195.054,7200.059,This will follow after we get into the contracting part.,231,,
790,0.97,7200.059,7214.273,We will be coming back to Coucnil next year to pass that program rate.,231,,
791,0.97,7214.273,7216.142,Thank you.,232,,
792,0.97,7216.142,7218.144,"Go ahead, council.",232,,
793,0.97,7218.144,7238.764,"I wanted to ask, when the rate comes forward, it would include things such as the transmission cost to bring the new powers into Seattle as attached to this program, trying to keep the cost contained.",233,,
794,0.97,7238.764,7239.131,Is that right?,233,,
795,0.97,7239.131,7240.466,That is right.,234,,
796,0.97,7240.466,7251.477,"This, as I mentioned earlier with the climate analysis we are doing to develop the program rate for this, looking at all of the incremental costs for the program.",234,,
797,0.97,7251.477,7266.692,"That is the Ppa cost for the energy itself, transmission, integration . We are looking at resource adequacy, our net source revenue, compliance issues, administrative costs.",234,,
798,0.97,7266.692,7271.197,Obviously all of those pieces will be ruled into that program rate.,234,,
799,0.97,7271.197,7278.304,Thank you.,235,,
800,0.97,7278.304,7279.038,"And, big picture here.",235,,
801,0.97,7279.038,7333.659,"I really appreciate city light taking advantage of its position as a major retail utility to promote development of renewable energy . Council members, this is a good time to send your questions into central staff so they can start to do some research on this and produce a memo for us, analyzing this proposal before it comes back to our Committee on September 15. one of the things I want to make sure is that, in terms of capital projects being developed for renewable energy, to make sure that those customers--we are understanding what our risks are versus what their risks are, understanding the risk of developing capital project's is put onto the customer so that the city does not have any surprises in terms of financial risk or liability . Council members, any questions or comments at this time?",235,,
802,0.97,7333.659,7334.56,Okay.,235,,
803,0.97,7334.56,7344.904,"General manager Smith, did you want to close it out with anything?",235,,
804,0.97,7344.904,7345.905,Thank you so much.,236,,
805,0.97,7345.905,7346.906,I appreciate your time today.,236,,
806,0.97,7346.906,7352.611,"We look forward to receiving your questions . As Scott said, this is something new for us.",236,,
807,0.97,7352.611,7369.095,I think staff has done a great job of really trying to isolate the risk and make certain it is landing with the right folks.,236,,
808,0.97,7369.095,7376.001,We look forward to hearing with you and responding to questions and working with Eric and Calvin to do now between when we come back and in September.,236,,
809,0.97,7376.001,7382.942,I know you are aware too but one of the things that I've got to make a call here for is timing is critical.,236,,
810,0.97,7382.942,7390.282,We are working with a particular arena that has a very aggressive goal around a certification for their building.,236,,
811,0.97,7390.282,7402.228,They have a Timeline and indeed they have a letter of intent the utility . The calendar that Scott shared works perfectly but we don't have a lot of wiggle room.,236,,
812,0.97,7402.228,7421.881,"Given that the city has put a lot of effort into working with climate pledge arena to make sure that their Aspirational goals are achieved, and that they are the net zero facility that we can be proud of as a city, we look forward to bringing this home for them.",236,,

814,0.97,7422.681,7425.551,Thank you.,237,,
815,0.97,7425.551,7429.588,This is just a briefing and discussion today.,237,,
816,0.97,7429.588,7431.857,We will consider this again on September 15.,237,,
817,0.97,7431.857,7447.206,"Get your questions into central staff . Thank you, Calvin for pinch hitting for Eric today.",237,,

820,0.97,7449.308,7453.579,"We will move on to our final three items on the agenda which is our other favorite utility, Seattle public utilities.",237,,
821,0.97,7453.579,7456.615,Willie clerk please read the short titles of the final three items into the record?,237,,
822,0.97,7456.615,7480.806,"Agenda items 10 through 12, council bills 120128 through 120130. an ordinance related to drainage services of Seattle public utilities, adjusting drainage rates to pass through changes to treatment rates charged by King County and capital financing requirements.",238,,
823,0.97,7480.806,7503.162,"An ordinance relating to wastewater services of Seattle public utilities, adjusting wastewater rate to pass through changes to treatment rates charged by King County and an ordinance relating to changes for water services of Seattle public utilities, revising water rates and charges and credits to low income customers.",238,,
824,0.97,7503.162,7504.93,"For breathing, discussion, and possible vote.",238,,
825,0.97,7504.93,7511.237,Thank you.,239,,
826,0.97,7511.237,7516.742,"Colleagues, this is the second time we will discuss the three utility rate ordinances for Seattle public utilities which will be implanting the strategic business plan.",239,,
827,0.97,7516.742,7525.084,"The rate has already been endorsed by the customer review panel, recommended by the city and adopted by the full council be a resolution 32000.",239,,
828,0.97,7525.084,7531.156,Brian good night devour Council central staff made correction to two of the bills.,239,,
829,0.97,7531.156,7539.265,"After we have a discussion here, I will move the substitute versions of those two bills.",239,,
830,0.97,7539.265,7546.972,"As you may recall, we had good news with average SP rates coming in lower than what was promised during the previous strategic plan.",239,,
831,0.97,7546.972,7561.086,"This was made possible things to a variety of factors including ideas proposed by the former community chair, Councilmember Herbold as well as a laser focus of managing costs.",239,,
832,0.97,7561.086,7569.094,"As we know, keeping rates low is important because utility expensive are essentially Regressive with lower income houses paying a larger percentage of the House will encumber utility bills.",239,,
833,0.97,7569.094,7574.633,We strive to minimize that burden with our utility discount program.,239,,
834,0.97,7574.633,7583.609,I would like to turn it over to Brian goodnight of city council central staff and then we can hear from Seattle public utilities.,239,,
835,0.97,7583.609,7584.61,"Good morning, Councilmember's.",240,,
836,0.97,7584.61,7586.812,"As you said, Brian goodnight.",240,,
837,0.97,7586.812,7593.719,I will provide a brief summary and then describe the substitute bills and then open it up for any questions.,240,,
838,0.97,7593.719,7615.474,"These three Council bills will establish rates for drainage, wastewater, and water lines of business respectively for Seattle public utilities or Spu the first two bills, 120128 inches for drainage and 120129 which is for wastewater will establish rates for a Three- year period from 2022 through 2024.",240,,
839,0.97,7615.474,7629.888,"The third bill, which is 120130 deals with water and will only establish rates for a two year period for 2022 and 2023.",240,,
840,0.97,7629.888,7635.361,"Typically, the Council considers rates setting legislation for one of us to use of state utilities each year with rates being set for a three-year period.",240,,
841,0.97,7635.361,7643.268,"Due to the pandemic and economic impacts, the executive did not propose legislation rates for 2021 according to the regular schedule.",240,,
842,0.97,7643.268,7650.376,"This year, to get back on track, in addition to the regularly scheduled updates related to wastewater, there is also the legislation covering the water line of business.",240,,
843,0.97,7650.376,7680.506,"The committee did receive a briefing from staff on the proposed rate increases . There is a memo on today's agenda that describes the proposal and compares the rates against the rates included in the strategic business plan at the Council adopted in May . very, very briefly, the proposed increases for wastewater are lower than the rate increases and the endorsed business plan for the first two years are slightly higher than the business plan for the third year.",240,,
844,0.97,7680.506,7689.548,"Overall, according to the updated forecast, these proposed rates along with the out years would result in a six year average being lower than the averages made in the business plan.",240,,
845,0.97,7689.548,7698.657,"With respect to the water line of business, the proposed rates for both years as well as the fixed year average are lower than what was adopted with this plan.",240,,
846,0.97,7698.657,7710.736,"One of the largest drivers for those rates for all three bills are generally lower relates to Spu's ability to take anchorage of the environment, swapping out high interest rates for low interest rate debt.",240,,
847,0.97,7710.736,7730.155,"Additionally, the rate studies that were performed at the basis for the proposal updated the assumption patterns, expectations that have been affected by the pandemic, updated assumptions regarding King County's timing and makes assumptions for the Department's use of its relatively high cash balances.",240,,
848,0.97,7730.155,7748.874,"Lastly, as committee chair Peterson mentioned in his opening remarks, last two bills are the bills for drainage and wastewater and do require an emphasis for the transmitted versions attached to the agenda and Emailed out last week are substitute versions.",240,,
849,0.97,7748.874,7753.579,The substitute bills do a couple of things.,240,,
850,0.97,7753.579,7757.483,They correct an Commission in section numbering.,240,,
851,0.97,7757.483,7758.117,A simple mistake.,240,,
852,0.97,7758.117,7762.921,"Second, they would replace incorrect wastewater rates for 2023 and 2024 with credit value.",240,,
853,0.97,7762.921,7774.133,The rate study that accompanies the bill makes assumptions regarding the future increases to King County's wastewater treatment rate.,240,,
854,0.97,7774.133,7780.606,"At this time, they only formally adopted the rate for 2022.",240,,
855,0.97,7780.606,7784.51,The bills themselves should only include the rate increase for 2022 but not the projected increases for 2023 and 2024.,240,,
856,0.97,7784.51,7788.981,The bill transmitted by the executive did inadvertently protect those increases.,240,,
857,0.97,7788.981,7808.033,"As an aside, when King County does formally adopt the treatment rate increases, Spu will translate separate Legislations proposing amendments to the drainage or wastewater rates and the Council most recently approved adjustments of this type last fall.",240,,
858,0.97,7808.033,7813.539,Both of the prepared substitutes have version numbers of Eta for reference.,240,,
859,0.97,7813.539,7817.709,I am happy to answer any questions.,240,,
860,0.97,7817.709,7822.247,Also Maria Coe and Karl Stickel are here as well and available for questions.,240,,

862,0.97,7824.483,7836.061,Thank you for that excellent summary and the excellent staff work to note the discrepancies in putting forward the substitute bills . I appreciate that.,241,,
863,0.97,7836.061,7859.618,"Council members, since we did have an extensive discussion about this when we first heard these items and of course we proved the rate as the of the resolution in May, I am not expecting a lot of discussion here but we do have Seattle public utilities here if we have more questions now.",241,,
864,0.97,7859.618,7860.085,Okay.,242,,

882,0.97,7964.022,7965.09,It was not super important.,251,,
883,0.97,7965.09,7982.908,"I just wanted to thank Spu general manager and you Mac, Pedersen for everybody's hard work and continuing to bring down the rate path from the endorsed rate of 5.2% in 2017 to now 3.9%.",251,,
