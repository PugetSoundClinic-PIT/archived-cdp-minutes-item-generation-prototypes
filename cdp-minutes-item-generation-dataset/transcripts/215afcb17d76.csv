36,0.97,365.098,396.362,"It has been no easy task to tackle the needs of the city during the covert crisis and economic downturn, a Civil- rights reckoning that has demanded much from all of us and many of you have been putting in day and night hours working remotely putting all your effort to make sure the city has the fun things that it needs through your support passage of the Jumpstart payroll tax and the spend plan, through summer deliberations, making sure there was emergency dollars and we began steps to community safety.",12,,

38,0.97,403.469,420.62,I want to make sure we recognize we have a lot of shared priorities in the budget and we cannot completely solve for the major issues facing the city in one budget season but we will continue to fight for solutions to homelessness and housing.,12,,

41,0.97,451.217,457.523,The city does not want to see city council fighting with the Mayor and this is not a political game.,12,,
42,0.97,457.523,461.227,"We have important policies we have engaged in, in a public way.",12,,
43,0.97,461.227,475.041,"We are working to keep parks open, to house homeless neighbors, a people have a place to live and we are addressing the impacts of the criminal justice system on black and Brown neighbors.",12,,
44,0.97,475.041,481.948,This is something that's very important to come together on and try to identify strategies to address these problems.,12,,
45,0.97,481.948,486.219,Let's remember where we started with the beginning of the budget.,12,,
46,0.97,486.219,494.927,Trying to solve some of the most tough issues in the city we began with a $13 million hole we needed to fix.,12,,
47,0.97,494.927,508.574,"This was due to timing, when the budget was set down and the transmitted budget package did not account for the $3 million that the Council committed to investments due to that timing.",12,,
48,0.97,508.574,511.377,From the Get-Go we had a hole to fill.,12,,
49,0.97,511.377,515.848,Had a $3 million investment to back into.,12,,
50,0.97,515.848,539.405,We needed to make sure we were addressing the revenue shortfall which really only had about $3 million included in the revenue emergency funds and it was critical for us to be able to not only address the gap in the budget but to address Backfilling those dollars and emergency reserves.,12,,
51,0.97,539.405,543.676,So I want to give you that framework as I talk about the context for the budget in front of us.,12,,
52,0.97,543.676,563.796,"The framework that I brought to the conversations in public and as we Deliberated which amendments should be included with the first back reserves, second, address and prevent austerity budgeting and third make sure we create an equitable economy by investing in housing, make sure we are healthy and safe.",12,,
53,0.97,563.796,588.554,"As we look at building back reserves we want to make sure this budget reflected the amount at least of the great recession emergency Reserve had, we wanted to replenish emergency reserves to at least the amount that the Jumpstart spend plan envisioned, around $40 million that were envisioned in the Jumpstart spend plan and the amount in the emergency reserves into the last great recession.",12,,
54,0.97,588.554,590.222,Colleagues we have done that.,12,,
55,0.97,590.222,602.168,"We have about $30 million in emergency reserves, just short of the goal of having $40 million and why is it important?",12,,
56,0.97,602.168,630.396,"It is low-wage workers, seniors, black and indigenous, people of color in those hardest hit by Covid and the worsening economic collapse in the city that we must be prepared to support, investing in reserves as an investment in vulnerable communities who in the Worst- case scenario next year or in the coming years will face even greater hardship if we only have $3 million in reserve.",12,,
57,0.97,630.396,653.586,Even when there are tens of millions more in the revised revenue package it was critical to put a sufficient amount Ideally around $40 million back into reserves especially as we see skyrocketing rates of Covid and we know that comes with uncertain and worsening physical futures.,12,,
58,0.97,653.586,665.531,When it comes to preventing austerity this budget protects the cuts to core government public sector workers and services they provide to make sure the most vulnerable and diverse communities have services that they need.,12,,
59,0.97,665.531,679.345,We have protected against steep cuts to the personnel in nature the budgetary layoffs that were planned in the budget have been replenished to ensure the continuity of services especially for the most vulnerable.,12,,
60,0.97,679.345,684.05,Now and to make sure those services are there as we work to recover.,12,,
61,0.97,684.05,699.465,"Every data point shows we cannot cut our way out of a recession, when cuts are made it prolongs economic downturn and hurts the private sector businesses as well as those who rely on public sector services.",12,,
62,0.97,699.465,731.597,"We see the data, it has been presented and repeated by local and national experts who looked at the last recession, so this budget takes an Anti-Austerity approach, building back budget cuts to personnel changes and efforts to make sure that the city core services like Childcare, libraries, transportation and infrastructure have the people they need to carry out services and promote economic resilience as we work on recovery in a more equitable Seattle.",12,,
63,0.97,731.597,737.269,The pillars of this budget to get to that recovery focused on housing health and safety.,12,,
64,0.97,737.269,744.977,Very briefly I want to highlight a few of the components you have put in as we think about policy and funding.,12,,
65,0.97,744.977,755.721,These have been included and that's why I refer to this as the draft budget because nothing in this budget was included that you have not discussed publicly in the committee settings.,12,,

277,0.97,2927.858,2947.01,"Furthermore this money is Úintended to supplement 15 stations the city has deployed, the previous language said the project would go toward propping up to nine SINKS in each Council district and I'm really worried about moving away from that mandate of boosting this up citywide because there is a need.",37,,
278,0.97,2947.01,2969.733,"I know the intent is in the right place but I'm concerned because of the money we won last year for the mobile Pitstop program, that was Repurposed to different hygiene models and did not serve the original model we wanted so I want to make sure this is different, so the money goes to the deep hands collective.",37,,
279,0.97,2969.733,2972.336,Iq very much.,38,,
280,0.97,2972.336,2976.306,I appreciate that testimony.,38,,
281,0.97,2976.306,2978.508,That's exactly why we want to make sure we're getting input.,38,,
282,0.97,2978.508,2996.159,We will follow up and make sure the intent is matching the language because it is intended to become a mentor to the city efforts to fully fund the hygiene stations by ensuring there is work we did with the community partner.,38,,
283,0.97,2996.159,3003.867,I can see the sponsor of the coming on board so we will follow up as we now have this on the radar.,38,,
284,0.97,3003.867,3004.735,Thank you very much.,38,,
285,0.97,3004.735,3006.57,We will follow up with you on that specific item.,38,,
286,0.97,3006.57,3012.242,"Daniel, you are next.",38,,
287,0.97,3012.242,3012.676,Good morning.,38,,
288,0.97,3012.676,3021.184,"Hi, last time I described a situation where white Supremacist and SPD target me with violence and city council said they would follow up and I hope that happen.",39,,
289,0.97,3021.184,3043.106,"I wanted to see if the Council stayed true and divested 50% or more, after the incident the same night I was targeted again taking cover and hearing a friendly shooter on my site, last Saturday I was assaulted by a security guard for filming everyday interjected themselves in the celebration.",39,,
290,0.97,3043.106,3048.412,Identified himself as killer and putting his hands on my throat.,39,,
291,0.97,3048.412,3058.522,"I have Video and a mark on my neck, every dollar to SPD is a dollar to organized crime, police are seen celebrity after killing black people in Los Angeles.",39,,
292,0.97,3058.522,3063.627,I believe in abolishing all body Cam footage needs to be available now.,39,,
293,0.97,3063.627,3066.797,A new chief from outside the city is needed.,39,,
294,0.97,3066.797,3069.032,Act swiftly or more protesters will be killed.,39,,
295,0.97,3069.032,3072.936,Pick your side of morality.,39,,
296,0.97,3072.936,3074.004,"Black lives matter, thank you.",39,,
297,0.97,3074.004,3076.64,I yield my time.,39,,
298,0.97,3076.64,3084.714,"Take you for sharing and we will follow up on that dramatic experience, the repeated experiences.",40,,
299,0.97,3084.714,3105.569,"Hello, I am the executive director for Seattle neighborhood group and I am a resident in district 5. I am calling in regards to the South Park safety coordinator position.",41,,
300,0.97,3105.569,3125.889,I want to express my deep gratitude for including this proposal in the 2021 budget and I wanted to give a huge thank you to Councilmember Herbold for her leadership and her amazing team for putting this proposal forward and a special thank you to Council President Gonzalez and Councilmember Pedersen for Cosponsoring this proposal.,41,,
301,0.97,3125.889,3132.896,I want to thank the South Park residents and businesses for speaking out in support for this position.,41,,
302,0.97,3132.896,3138.802,This is a great example of communities voicing their needs and government responding accordingly.,41,,
303,0.97,3138.802,3141.404,"Thank you, I killed my time.",41,,
304,0.97,3141.404,3143.073,The next three speakers.,42,,
305,0.97,3143.073,3147.911,[reading names] good morning.,42,,
306,0.97,3147.911,3152.816,Good morning.,43,,
307,0.97,3152.816,3158.321,I work at Wellspring family services in rapid Rehousing for families.,43,,
308,0.97,3158.321,3167.23,I'm here to speak to the importance of including additional rental assistance for family rapid Rehousing programs in the balancing package.,43,,
309,0.97,3167.23,3184.848,"You heard from families participating in these programs on October 20th, rapid Rehousing helps families move from experiencing homelessness into stable housing, the program provides rental assistance, employment support and other services to help families find stability and permanent housing.",43,,
310,0.97,3184.848,3193.156,"Unfortunately Covid has had a devastating effect on the employment market, in particular for families in rapid Rehousing programs.",43,,
311,0.97,3193.156,3206.436,Rental assistance is based on income subsidy so it has been difficult for people to find employment and families are staying in the program for longer and families are paying larger amounts.,43,,
312,0.97,3206.436,3217.781,Seattle human services has been helpful collaborators in doing what they can to keep us afloat through 2020 but the fixes do not solve the critical funding gap we anticipate.,43,,
313,0.97,3217.781,3226.089,We are asking you to provide additional rental assistance funds for family rapid Rehousing to ensure that families can maintain hard-earned housing stability.,43,,
314,0.97,3226.089,3234.264,Thank you to Councilmember Herbold for her leadership on this and the support we have heard from other Councilmembers.,43,,
315,0.97,3234.264,3235.532,Thank you very much.,43,,
316,0.97,3235.532,3247.611,"[reading names], if you're still on the line Kathryn we will go back to you to see if we can get you off mute.",44,,
317,0.97,3247.611,3249.613,Good morning.,44,,
318,0.97,3249.613,3254.818,Good morning.,45,,
319,0.97,3254.818,3259.222,We can hear you.,46,,
320,0.97,3259.222,3260.89,"Let's restart your time, thank you so much.",46,,
321,0.97,3260.89,3263.126,Good morning.,47,,
322,0.97,3263.126,3274.037,"I live in district 7 and I'm urging you guys, the city Council to Defund SPD at least 80% and possibly Abolishment.",47,,
323,0.97,3274.037,3289.319,"So yes protests are going on in the city demands have not been met yet, Wednesday I witnessed a Protester who was beat up by police.",47,,
324,0.97,3289.319,3309.439,"Not only was he laying down on the street for 50 minutes with no police trying to help, also, also the police responded with no Stricture, it was a piece of white cloth and we thought the Protester was dead.",47,,
325,0.97,3309.439,3324.688,And after that SPD has the guts to say that person had a Premeditated seizure when the bystanders saw the police smash his head on the concrete.,47,,
326,0.97,3324.688,3343.773,"So this is brutality, police brutality every day and yesterday I also saw police with a apprehended a lady, they pulled over a lady, four police officers pointed a gun at her and her hands were shaking.",47,,
327,0.97,3343.773,3348.812,It was actually a call from her Boyfriend and the police did not know how to react and respond.,47,,
328,0.97,3348.812,3356.92,Therefore very poorly trained and this is police totality every day.,47,,
329,0.97,3356.92,3362.025,So I heard you guys to find some solutions.,47,,
330,0.97,3362.025,3368.631,"We locate the money to needed services such as education, services for the black and Brown community.",47,,
331,0.97,3368.631,3372.035,Thank you very much for that we will follow up with you.,48,,
332,0.97,3372.035,3376.639,Rebecca Smith good morning.,48,,
333,0.97,3376.639,3378.742,Good morning are you able to hear me?,49,,
334,0.97,3378.742,3381.444,Yes we are.,50,,
335,0.97,3381.444,3382.345,Wonderful.,51,,
336,0.97,3382.345,3394.824,With regards to Defunding Seattle police I would like to draw your attention to the Micro community policing plans which were implemented in 2015.,51,,
337,0.97,3394.824,3415.879,"With the idea of combining police and community engagement to identify specific problems for specific neighborhoods in Seattle, to increase police effectiveness and I want to talk about who makes these surveys and who responds.",51,,
338,0.97,3415.879,3421.551,The surveys are written by students at the University of Seattle.,51,,
339,0.97,3421.551,3435.165,"Which has a student body of 52.6% white students, 26% Asian, 11% International leaving 5.1% black, 2% native and the rest Pacific Island are.",51,,
340,0.97,3435.165,3455.485,"Yet, those who are responding to these surveys which are supposed to shed light on community input into where needs like with regards to the police, so those who respond to the survey are 79.5% white.",51,,
341,0.97,3455.485,3458.721,10.5% Asian with 3.8% being black.,51,,
342,0.97,3458.721,3474.804,6.2% Hispanic and of these respondents 77% are college educated so I would like to point out we're not really getting feedback from those who are most affected and those who are interacting most frequently with SPD.,51,,
343,0.97,3474.804,3486.316,"So, your city council office is one of the administrators of the survey I would request you withdraw from your support from this plan.",51,,
344,0.97,3486.316,3490.019,Rebecca thank you so much.,52,,
345,0.97,3490.019,3499.762,I will ask if you may be able to send us the rest of your comments and we will follow up on the Micro policing concerns.,52,,
346,0.97,3499.762,3501.264,Thank you for putting that on our radar.,52,,
347,0.97,3501.264,3512.342,Going back to Catherine and then [reading names] Kathryn are you available?,52,,
348,0.97,3512.342,3513.576,Yes can you do now?,53,,
349,0.97,3513.576,3516.179,Excellent sorry for the delay.,54,,
350,0.97,3516.179,3518.448,No worries.,55,,
351,0.97,3518.448,3522.285,Thank you for returning.,55,,
352,0.97,3522.285,3530.393,"I want, I am a Seattle resident in the code 98109.",55,,
353,0.97,3530.393,3546.476,"I am calling to echo the call to Defund SPD by at least 50% and to allocate sufficient budgeting for Participatory budgeting, particularly allocated to these communities.",55,,
354,0.97,3546.476,3562.125,I believe that organizations are calling for at least $100 million to go toward that Participatory budgeting although that seems like the least that would be acceptable.,55,,
355,0.97,3562.125,3570.233,And to make sure that the priorities of the budgeting are funded by community identified priorities.,55,,
356,0.97,3570.233,3592.956,I want to echo what Rebecca was just sharing about moving away from Micro policing and being intentional about making sure we are doing outreach to communities who are disproportionately impacted by police violence when making any and all decisions.,55,,
357,0.97,3592.956,3608.438,"And, as a constituent I want to highlight that the recent polling that suggests a lack of support for city council is not reflective of my experience.",55,,
358,0.97,3608.438,3616.346,I am appreciative of city council efforts to Defund SPD although I also believe we need to push harder and do more.,55,,
359,0.97,3616.346,3617.28,Thank you.,55,,
360,0.97,3617.28,3619.916,Thank you very much again for waiting.,56,,
361,0.97,3619.916,3622.051,"Good morning, Karen.",56,,
362,0.97,3622.051,3629.425,Thank you for your patience as well.,56,,
363,0.97,3639.435,3639.969,Good morning Karen.,56,,
364,0.97,3639.969,3645.008,"Good morning, thank you I am a district 7 resident.",57,,
365,0.97,3645.008,3651.514,Winter weather is approaching and we have way too many chronically homeless people living on sheltered on the streets.,57,,
366,0.97,3651.514,3662.425,It is inhumane not to provide for those suffering from mental health issues which combined with the elements will be disastrous.,57,,
367,0.97,3662.425,3685.214,"I would like to see the city invest more in shelters such as the new King County Congregants shelter, the shelter was implemented and provides for issues that keep the chronically homeless accepting offers of existing shelter, each person is giving a pod with services including case managers, housing navigators and mental health specialist.",57,,
368,0.97,3685.214,3694.157,Placing more people in shelters will mean fewer 911 calls and could be an alternative to rotation in and out of jail's from low-level offenders.,57,,
369,0.97,3694.157,3705.068,I would like to note that Defunding the police by 50% is not reasonable when we are experiencing 40% rise in violent crimes in Seattle.,57,,
370,0.97,3705.068,3708.571,Thank you.,57,,
371,0.97,3708.571,3713.576,"Thank you, I still see Jim is not present, Naomi and then Katie.",58,,
372,0.97,3713.576,3723.953,"Good morning, Naomi.",58,,
373,0.97,3725.855,3729.092,Hello.,59,,
374,0.97,3729.092,3730.326,Can you hear me?,59,,
375,0.97,3730.326,3734.564,Okay.,59,,
376,0.97,3734.564,3746.776,My name is Naomi from the low income housing Institute and I like to thank the entire Council for their dedication and incredible spirit and love providing for the on House community we appreciate it.,59,,
377,0.97,3746.776,3776.639,"I want to share an experience from last week at the park where we conducted outreach and partnership with reach, there were no police, just Community- based organizations and service providers, we were called to respond to concerns about tents in the park and rebuilding stronger relationships with those in Encampments to identify the best clients to be referred to the villages.",59,,
378,0.97,3776.639,3794.023,We worked to show residence with a tiny House villages look like and to discern which village was the best for resident needs and in the end we peacefully and successfully Transitioned 10 individuals and couples into shelter and were able to remove tents from the park.,59,,
379,0.97,3794.023,3817.847,"In many cases the encampment residence would only accept tiny House villages, without the option of these villages many would've remained in the park creating the increasingly contentious situation between them and neighbors and without the existing relationships that we diligently developed we when I moved people into the best place for their needs.",59,,
380,0.97,3817.847,3825.054,This success proves Community- based organizations and service providers are better equipped to meet the needs of Un-Housed neighbors and surrounding neighborhoods.,59,,
381,0.97,3825.054,3833.262,It proves the fundamental component of successful outreach is the availability of dignified state.,59,,
382,0.97,3833.262,3835.898,Thank you.,59,,
383,0.97,3835.898,3837.567,"Katie, good afternoon.",60,,
384,0.97,3837.567,3840.102,"Or morning, good morning.",60,,
385,0.97,3840.102,3842.004,Good morning.,61,,
386,0.97,3842.004,3844.473,Can you hear me?,61,,
387,0.97,3844.473,3847.109,Yes we can.,62,,
388,0.97,3847.109,3859.088,Good morning I am a district two resident.,63,,
389,0.97,3859.355,3866.395,Spy we will start your time over peers sorry about that.,63,,
390,0.97,3866.395,3876.939,My name is Katie I am a small business owner in Seattle and a district two resident as well as a black woman living in Seattle.,64,,
391,0.97,3876.939,3898.261,I wanted to Piggyback on what Rebecca was saying about the representation in polling which goes to further explain representation in other areas and areas you may not be hearing from us on . for example in public comment there's probably not a lot of black people.,64,,
392,0.97,3898.261,3907.036,Because having access to hearing about these different things can be hard for many reasons.,64,,
393,0.97,3907.036,3944.407,"I also want to just reiterate the importance of language in the budget and in contracts with cities and I want to make sure we are writing down black communities, indigenous communities not just equitable communities because that is a trendy word now but equity does not necessarily mean equity for black and indigenous people so I want to make sure even when people of color that can often leave out black and indigenous people so I want to make sure the writing in the budget says black and indigenous people and black and indigenous youth are very crucial in this movement.",64,,
394,0.97,3944.407,3968.331,We need to make sure we're putting a lot of money toward them because just like our House of community no there were kids once and if we don't get in the resources and skills in order to be a resident here than they will end up in the same way so we have to invest in youth to invest in the future that we all desire.,64,,
395,0.97,3968.331,3972.635,I yield the rest of my time.,64,,
396,0.97,3972.635,3974.203,Thank you to everybody who has called.,65,,
397,0.97,3974.203,3988.05,"We have Jim and Bob listed as not present and Derek from before, other than that we have now heard from everybody who has signed in and is present.",65,,
398,0.97,3988.05,3995.758,"Folks, that will end the public comment period and we will move into items of business on the agenda.",65,,
399,0.97,3995.758,3999.662,As we move into item 1 I know all of these will sort of run together.,65,,
400,0.97,3999.662,4012.641,I defer to you to let me know if it is needed or possible to read in the's and the items so we don't have to pause if we move past it.,65,,
401,0.97,4012.641,4019.148,If that is desired we can go ahead and do the larger headings.,65,,
402,0.97,4019.148,4023.386,"Yes, I can do that.",66,,

407,0.97,4061.19,4075.805,"We will have central staff walk us through the agenda and I want to remind folks there are over, well almost 150 actions that this budget encompasses and we will walk through each one of those.",67,,
408,0.97,4075.805,4084.547,Asking folks to keep comments relatively short because central staff does have a presentation and they will give an overview of each item.,67,,
409,0.97,4084.547,4100.162,"I am going to provide some news as well, as we get toward the end of central staff opening presentations to give you context looking at the essential amendments so go ahead and open it up for us.",67,,
410,0.97,4100.162,4102.765,"Thank you, good morning.",68,,
411,0.97,4102.765,4105.968,I am your Council central staff.,68,,
412,0.97,4105.968,4117.046,Today we are on step four in the budget process and I will provide overview discussion initially and then we will walk through the presentation and the agenda by category.,68,,
413,0.97,4117.046,4130.059,We are not intending to present each item individually given the numbers that were just described by each item is listed in the slides.,68,,

415,0.97,4155.618,4170.432,"So as I mentioned we are on step four in the project process where we discuss the balancing package, step four of six with two short weeks until we adopt the Balanced-Budget.",68,,
416,0.97,4170.432,4183.245,"As I noted I will summarize, provide an overview of the ballot and package do my best to slice together related items as I walk through these categories.",68,,
417,0.97,4183.245,4187.95,And then as I noted I will pause between each of the investment areas for questions and comments.,68,,
418,0.97,4187.95,4194.823,The majority and as I noted the central staff team is on the line and available to answer questions.,68,,
419,0.97,4194.823,4197.059,Next slide please.,68,,
420,0.97,4197.059,4206.769,Following the discussion today on the proposed balancing package the next step in the process will be voting on the package including proposed amendments to the package.,68,,
421,0.97,4206.769,4213.542,As a reminder Councilmembers wishing to amend must submit request to central staff by 5:00 P.M.,68,,
422,0.97,4213.542,4222.184,"On Thursday November 12th, any proposals that increase spending must include offsetting cuts.",68,,
423,0.97,4222.184,4232.995,If any of your proposals would require new legislation that needs to be introduced and referred to the committee by Monday November 16th.,68,,
424,0.97,4232.995,4244.073,If you have not already notified central staff of any legislation that might be drafted please do so as soon as possible.,68,,
425,0.97,4244.073,4248.877,Unless there are questions about the next step we will move on.,68,,
426,0.97,4248.877,4249.812,Great.,68,,
427,0.97,4249.812,4251.08,Thank you.,68,,
428,0.97,4251.08,4262.491,"So, this slide is to provide a general overview of the balancing package and some of this is covered by the chair in her opening remarks this morning.",68,,
429,0.97,4262.491,4269.598,As you recall the first action that the chair and the committee needed to address was resolving the starving balance shortfall.,68,,
430,0.97,4269.598,4286.248,"After working with the city budget office and reconciling what was transmitted in the budget and the actions included in the budget revision ordinance, we needed to resolve a starting shortfall of $8.8 million.",68,,
431,0.97,4286.248,4293.555,"That is sort of step one in the process, the package overall increases use of General Fund by $68.2 million.",68,,
432,0.97,4293.555,4318.547,This includes $26 million of net new general fund investments just over $20 million to resolve some of the revenue shortfalls identified in the November 2020 revenue forecast in the short term rental fund commercial parking tax Fund and school zone camera Fund and Replenishing $32 million to the city emergency Fund.,68,,
433,0.97,4318.547,4342.905,"In addition to the proposed amendments, the third quarter to replenish the city emergency Fund, the third-quarter supplemental budget ordinance, in amendment to that bill will swap out the use of $3 million from the revenue stabilization fund with General fund resulting in a total increase to the Reserve funds by about $35 million in this balancing package.",68,,
434,0.97,4342.905,4346.175,Next slide please.,68,,
435,0.97,4346.175,4372.334,"I want to take a moment to talk about the city fiscal reserves, this chart illustrates the ending balance in the city reserves since 2006, you can see even with the proposal and the balancing package to replenish the $2 million to the emergency Fund and $3 million to revenue stabilization, the balance in the city fiscal reserves are below where the city was during the last recession.",68,,
436,0.97,4372.334,4379.508,This will leave about 2.4% of the city total general fund revenues in the reserves.,68,,
437,0.97,4379.508,4390.586,I will note that taking this action to replenish the reserve the emergency reserves is consistent with the spending plan for the payroll tax that the Council adopted.,68,,
438,0.97,4390.586,4398.16,Replenishing the majority of funds used to support the joint Covid relief efforts.,68,,
439,0.97,4398.16,4400.429,Did you reiterate that point?,69,,
440,0.97,4400.429,4413.375,"I think it is really important for the framework and for the budget, both with the Jumpstart spend plan originally intended to do and then where we are at currently.",69,,
441,0.97,4413.375,4415.244,Sure.,70,,
442,0.97,4415.244,4428.857,A few short months ago the payroll tax was adopted and the Jumpstart payroll tax as well as the spending plan associated with that tax.,70,,
443,0.97,4428.857,4437.399,In addition the Council has taken actions to fund emergency Covid relief with direct financial assistance to the community using the city emergency funds.,70,,
444,0.97,4437.399,4448.71,"After working with the Mayor, the Mayor and the council agreed to spend $45 million in 2020 and 2021 from emergency funds.",70,,
445,0.97,4448.71,4459.721,The payroll tax spending plan included specific allocation in 2021 to replenish emergency funds used to support Covid relief efforts.,70,,
446,0.97,4459.721,4468.096,So this proposal to replenish the emergency reserves is consistent with that item in the spending plan.,70,,
447,0.97,4468.096,4471.7,You so much.,71,,
448,0.97,4471.7,4475.137,I do not see any questions on that.,71,,
449,0.97,4475.137,4480.375,Moving on to what's in the balancing package.,72,,
450,0.97,4480.375,4488.65,"The agenda is organized the following main investment areas that are broken down into Subcategories, economic recovery, health and safety and housing.",72,,
451,0.97,4488.65,4525.053,The numbers on this table show the investments proposed by category that are supported by a mix of funding sources including use of the general fund revenue that we learned of in the 2020 forecast revenue update as well as the SPD D revenue to support investments including Reprogramming spending proposed for the 2021 budget to be Reprogrammed to restore funding for previous commitments as well as supporting other Councilmember priorities.,72,,
452,0.97,4525.053,4529.391,Thank you so much.,73,,
453,0.97,4529.391,4534.463,I will also NOTE there is a lot of crossover.,73,,
454,0.97,4534.463,4551.914,"Really appreciate the work central staff has done to try to identify for the public instead of departmental investments, where we are investing in strategies to keep folks healthy, in housing and to ensure economic resilience and to build back the economy in a more equitable way.",73,,
455,0.97,4551.914,4563.325,"For example, where there is crossover the housing section does not include the $30 million that we are building back to the budget.",73,,
456,0.97,4563.325,4566.328,I think that was more categories in the equitable economy recovery section.,73,,
457,0.97,4566.328,4576.939,30 million from the sale to invest in the strategic investment for those who are historically at risk for displacement and affording affordable housing.,73,,
458,0.97,4576.939,4584.046,And you will see other areas where they could be categorized differently but we wanted to provide you the overall context.,73,,
459,0.97,4584.046,4591.253,I think you can move on and I would like to make one NOTE as we go into the discussion.,73,,
460,0.97,4591.253,4602.731,As fissures have done in the past we have set aside a small amount to make sure that dollars are not reflected in this budget.,73,,
461,0.97,4602.731,4622.451,"My intent is to set aside at least $1.9 million available as a starting place if Councilmembers have additional priorities, because we are extremely concerned about the need to protect the emergency reserves, could you go back two slides?",73,,
462,0.97,4622.451,4627.656,This emergency reserve level.,73,,
463,0.97,4627.656,4628.69,There we go.,73,,
464,0.97,4628.69,4652.214,The chart here shows what we have had in the $3.1 million left in the Reserve and Rehab and thoughtful and I hope you will agree they have been Proactive in conserving almost $40 million so $35 million in the emergency reserve section.,73,,
465,0.97,4652.214,4673.001,My hope is as you look for possible amendments or strategies that we do not dip into this emergency Reserve and we think of the set aside 1.9 million and other strategies you may want to see changing in terms of the levels of investments to really help protect against dipping into the Reserve any further.,73,,
466,0.97,4673.001,4689.051,"As you can see on the total amount, we are just on par with what the 2008 and 2007 actual emergency funds were, the total going into the recession.",73,,
467,0.97,4689.051,4696.158,In order for us to be prudent about the unknown for next year like to try to stay as close to 40 million as possible.,73,,
468,0.97,4696.158,4701.863,That is my hope and ask and the news I wanted to share.,73,,
469,0.97,4701.863,4708.57,"Obviously not enough for the priorities but it is a healthy starting place, thank you very much.",73,,
470,0.97,4708.57,4711.573,Thank you.,74,,
471,0.97,4711.573,4712.841,If you can jump ahead one more.,74,,
472,0.97,4712.841,4740.402,"Okay starting with walking through the proposals and economic recovery investment, items two through 16 are related to effective government services including actions like restoring funding for positions for budgetary layoffs, looking at the independent forecast office, requesting a report on city retirement, requesting curbside pickup and returns at all library branches.",74,,
473,0.97,4740.402,4754.216,In total this will result in $46.9 million of spending added to or modified in the proposed budget and this excludes the $32 million proposed to replenish the emergency fund in 2021.,74,,
474,0.97,4754.216,4771.333,"It also includes request to fund the transportation impact fee study with request for reports in certain departments on strategies to mitigate the impacts of construction, activity on small businesses.",74,,
475,0.97,4771.333,4777.005,Next slide please.,74,,
476,0.97,4777.005,4801.563,"As well as recognizing the revenue from the transportation benefit district funds, implemented through the voter approved proposition one restoring funding or Backfilling the revenue shortfall for the commercial parking tax and the school zone camera fund as well as funding a new recruit class and testing in the fire Department.",74,,
477,0.97,4801.563,4814.409,"I will pause, that's a brief summary of some of the actions included in the effective government services and provide time for Councilmembers to ask questions or highlight specific proposals.",74,,
478,0.97,4814.409,4818.647,You very much.,75,,
479,0.97,4818.647,4828.59,"With each of the bullets you just saw, there is the backup Council budget actions and statements of intent the one Pagers that go with these actions.",75,,
480,0.97,4828.59,4842.604,If you would like to ask questions or feature any of the pieces you sponsored or cosponsored we are happy to have time in today's agenda to make sure those items are lifted up.,75,,
481,0.97,4842.604,4854.216,"If there is clarification you would like we are happy to seek that, this is the time to ask questions and digging in so as people think about possible amendments before Thursday's deadline you have a chance to really understand the issues.",75,,
482,0.97,4854.216,4859.688,I will ask if you could do a quick verification piece.,75,,
483,0.97,4859.688,4872.033,I know it has been said there was $57 million in New net revenue and I'm wondering if you can help us break down that number about what was actually available?,75,,
484,0.97,4872.033,4877.906,It's slightly different than 57 million in New net revenue?,75,,
485,0.97,4877.906,4878.173,Correct?,75,,
486,0.97,4878.173,4878.94,Correct.,76,,
487,0.97,4878.94,4884.813,I think you have all seen various references to $57 million.,76,,
488,0.97,4884.813,4900.262,So just as a reminder that includes about $68 million of new general fund provided in the forecast or revenue update provided in November.,76,,
489,0.97,4900.262,4927.088,"But then you have to subtract out the shortfalls and the short-term rental bond, the commercial parking tax and the school zone camera fund resulting in $41 million of General fund availability after accounting for those shortfalls and then there's $15 million of new revenue which is supporting investments in capital projects and affordable housing.",76,,
490,0.97,4927.088,4933.395,So the parameters around how those dollars can be used.,77,,
491,0.97,4933.395,4951.112,That is correct and you will see later in the presentation that the proposed use of that revenue is helping address some of the shortfalls and is supporting Councilmember proposals for investments in transportation projects and the Department of transportation.,78,,
492,0.97,4951.112,4957.585,"That's great, I thought the context was helpful as we hear from Stakeholders wondering if you have 57 million why are these items left out?",79,,
493,0.97,4957.585,4973.234,There are still important Trade- offs we were considering as we build back the emergency reserves and also there are some restrictions on how those dollars can be used.,79,,
494,0.97,4973.234,4977.906,There were some deep gaps when the revenue forecast came out specific to some transportation connected issues that we needed to account for.,79,,
495,0.97,4977.906,4980.342,"So, appreciate that formula.",79,,
496,0.97,4980.342,4984.612,Any questions or comments on this?,79,,
497,0.97,4984.612,4986.047,Councilmember Pedersen.,79,,
498,0.97,4986.047,4991.72,"Thank you, thank you to central staff for pulling this together.",80,,
499,0.97,4991.72,4999.627,Amazing to see the agenda published with all the items and to think about the work that went into those.,80,,
500,0.97,4999.627,5005.4,From the budget chair staff and from central staff and the Department so thank you for the hard work.,80,,
501,0.97,5005.4,5017.746,"I know there are a lot of moving pieces with different transportation funding sources, just to clarify for the public and then ask the question, and maybe set up a potential form C.",80,,
502,0.97,5017.746,5030.458,The 24.8 million of St Bd funds that is to implement the newly approved proposition one just approved overwhelmingly by voters last week.,80,,
503,0.97,5030.458,5036.364,"I believe, the amount that will generate is in excess of $30 million.",80,,
504,0.97,5036.364,5046.307,I think what is happening is that the proposal from s D.O.T.,80,,
505,0.97,5046.307,5058.119,Spending plans have moved around but the latest version of this I think has $8 million just sitting idle in reserves.,80,,
506,0.97,5058.119,5067.095,"So we want to make sure that we are, we are allocating those funds to the appropriate buckets.",80,,
507,0.97,5067.095,5089.551,"Not specific projects necessarily, but to the buckets that voters approve and then looking at opening up the document, it looks like there is a proposed spending plan that seems to zero out infrastructure maintenance and capital improvement and instead has money sitting in reserves.",80,,
508,0.97,5089.551,5119.681,"So since voters approved up to 9 million for maintenance and improvements and the Seattle times published the original spent plan including 5 million for the researcher maintenance and capital improvements, I think we might want to balance that a little bit so that we are showing to the voters after they just approved it we are not trying to zero out anything from those various categories.",80,,
509,0.97,5119.681,5121.883,So I will confer with central staff on the.,80,,
510,0.97,5121.883,5123.885,Thank you so much.,81,,
511,0.97,5123.885,5132.494,We appreciate your deep dive into that.,81,,
512,0.97,5132.494,5134.295,We will turn to central staff for comments or reaction.,81,,
513,0.97,5134.295,5146.808,I want to make sure I share with Council what,81,,
514,0.97,5157.585,5171.099,We are happy to continue to engage as Councilmember Peterson signaled in if there is clarification needed on the spend plan and we get a chance to talk about it.,82,,
515,0.97,5171.099,5177.438,I think now is a great time to get clarification on the questions.,82,,
516,0.97,5177.438,5188.049,I just wanted to be sure for you that there is an awareness that the effort that the chair and central staff adopted what s DOT spend plan was this whole and no changes were made.,82,,
517,0.97,5188.049,5193.121,"Calvin, do you have thoughts or additional information for us to share?",82,,
518,0.97,5193.121,5207.936,"Just to confirm that the transportation chair is correct, that the proposed from s DOT does cover transit investments as well as passes and funding for some of the West Seattle related work approved by voters.",83,,
519,0.97,5207.936,5210.838,There is funding held in reserves.,83,,
520,0.97,5210.838,5219.447,I think part of it is in the context of all the other move Seattle and other transportation pieces.,83,,
521,0.97,5219.447,5225.086,I think they were holding onto some of the reserves to come back and have the discussion.,83,,
522,0.97,5225.086,5236.097,Certainly Council can take action and make it available for the budget action as well.,83,,
523,0.97,5236.097,5240.301,Any additional comments?,84,,
524,0.97,5240.301,5241.769,Please go ahead.,84,,
525,0.97,5241.769,5258.72,"Quickly, these categories are not project specific for this particular spend plan we received from s DOT but I think it would be nice to restore all line items voters approved so they see funding for each line item.",85,,
526,0.97,5258.72,5265.493,"In district 4, we have bridge over pass on 45Th street that we want to be sure gets funded.",85,,
527,0.97,5265.493,5268.396,So there are Capitol projects like that that are important.,85,,
528,0.97,5268.396,5276.137,So it would be good to signal that we want to invest in those as well.,85,,
529,0.97,5276.137,5278.139,Thank you.,85,,
530,0.97,5278.139,5282.243,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",86,,
531,0.97,5282.243,5290.151,Are there additional comments?,86,,
532,0.97,5290.151,5290.952,Yes.,87,,
533,0.97,5290.952,5291.886,Hello Councilmember Juarez.,88,,
534,0.97,5291.886,5293.054,Alley I will get back to you.,88,,
535,0.97,5293.054,5299.761,I am swimming in paper and screens but I will put out a few basic comments.,89,,
536,0.97,5299.761,5301.763,"First, thank you for the balancing package.",89,,
537,0.97,5301.763,5322.95,"I love how you broke it down into the sections so we can understand not only the category but the price tag attached to it for the economic recovery, the 55 million, health and safety, housed 11, how it breaks down into the budget.",89,,
538,0.97,5322.95,5327.388,"I know at some point, I want to clarify something here.",89,,
539,0.97,5327.388,5345.106,"We looked at what the executive had sent on November 2 and Madam chair, you and I had Frank discussions about what our concerns, our proposals, and of the seven that the Mayor sent down, four were restore Tim.",89,,
540,0.97,5345.106,5366.694,"I see some had been absorbed in what you shared yesterday when you break down your budget direction and where you're pointed to on the economic recovery health and safety housed and the Mayor sent something on November 2 about clean cities initiative, restoring strategic investment.",89,,
541,0.97,5366.694,5371.466,I see that's there to the tune of 30 million.,89,,
542,0.97,5371.466,5371.833,That's great.,89,,
543,0.97,5371.833,5379.006,"Expanding Sheeter capacity, I see a lot of this in the 14 million restored.",89,,
544,0.97,5379.006,5389.751,I have see a lot of the initiatives that were proposed by the initiative that came later because some came later and we didn't know we would have additional funds.,89,,
545,0.97,5389.751,5394.655,I have been doing this cross Referencing.,89,,
546,0.97,5394.655,5396.824,"I have shared this with you, Madam chair.",89,,
547,0.97,5396.824,5400.995,I see we have really strong alignment with the proposals sent down.,89,,
548,0.97,5400.995,5401.429,Thank you for that.,89,,
549,0.97,5401.429,5410.938,I know you and I talked about that last week about where they overlap and where we have wins.,89,,
550,0.97,5410.938,5432.794,"I am of the opinion that were these budget Tributaries come from or revenue streams come from, if I can keep with the analogy, as long as they lead to the great sea of the public good, I don't care if it is labeled legislative branch or executive branch as long as the money gets to where it has to go.",89,,
551,0.97,5432.794,5443.237,"So I will make clear now that I am concerned about Revisiting and possibly providing another form, another form to see on the clean cities initiative.",89,,
552,0.97,5443.237,5453.981,"I near it is to the tune of 5.6, and I know a lot of what you shared is absorbed into the three areas you have outlined and the staff have this morning.",89,,
553,0.97,5453.981,5457.919,I would like to have people keep an open mind about that.,89,,
554,0.97,5457.919,5469.831,"We know right now that particularly us district representatives, that is number one issue we are dealing with, public safety, for the unsheltered folks.",89,,
555,0.97,5469.831,5470.231,Thank you again.,89,,
556,0.97,5470.231,5484.245,We know we have the new navigators in the South park and other people that we have ready to go to be deployed to provide services and all the things that we need on the ground.,89,,
557,0.97,5484.245,5492.587,"We also need desperately the cleaning of the parks, needles, the garbage, all those issues.",89,,
558,0.97,5492.587,5503.03,"As I have stated before, it's great to have hand washing stations, great to have port O Potties, great that they're doing over time picking up garbage, but we need more.",89,,
559,0.97,5503.03,5505.166,I hope we can keep an open mind.,89,,
560,0.97,5505.166,5518.613,"I like what you said in the beginning, Madam chair, that we are working together with the executive to get this done, that we don't have time--nobody has tame for political posturing.",89,,
561,0.97,5518.613,5518.98,We just don't.,89,,
562,0.97,5518.98,5522.049,"With that, I am going to keep an open mind.",89,,
563,0.97,5522.049,5526.32,But I wanted you to know that the clean cities initiative is still important to me.,89,,
564,0.97,5526.32,5529.29,I don't know if it's to the tune of 5.6.,89,,
565,0.97,5529.29,5531.525,Maybe we can have central staff look.,89,,

728,0.97,6570.864,6584.611,"I want to speak again with my appreciation, chair Mosqueda, for your inclusion of the funding in the chair's balancing package.",114,,
729,0.97,6584.611,6626.686,The context I think for some of my enthusiasm about increased funding for bridge maintenance is out of an understanding that one of the large reasons s DOT is considering a replacement of West Seattle bridge instead of a repair of a bridge that our technical experts feel has only a 5% chance of not having remainder of its 48 life extend with repair is because of s DOT's concern.,114,,
730,0.97,6626.686,6630.757,Our technical experts are focused on will the repair work?,114,,
731,0.97,6630.757,6631.124,Will it stick?,114,,
732,0.97,6631.124,6637.597,S DOT has to consider that but then they also have to consider their role as asset manager.,114,,
733,0.97,6637.597,6644.304,"As asset manager, they have to believe that the resources exist to maintain the bridge.",114,,
734,0.97,6644.304,6658.818,"They estimate that the West Seattle bridge, the annual maintenance costs, are about $500,000 a year as opposed to about $250,000 a year.",114,,
735,0.97,6658.818,6681.374,"I hope the Council thinks hard about whether or not it is fiscally responsible to pursue a nearly $400 million infrastructure project instead of, you know, a $70 million--I am sorry.",114,,
736,0.97,6681.374,6685.045,I am getting my numbers mixed up.,114,,
737,0.97,6685.045,6699.225,A much less costly repair simply because s DOT doesn't have the confidence that we can maintain the repaired bridge at a higher rate.,114,,
738,0.97,6699.225,6718.778,"Given that I really respect s DOT's role as asset manager, I think we as policy makers have an obligation to address this issue as it relates to annual maintenance funding and to do everything we can to act on the recommendations of the city auditor.",114,,
739,0.97,6718.778,6725.452,"Again, thank you for adding this.",114,,
740,0.97,6725.452,6727.02,Thank you very much.,115,,

744,0.97,6739.899,6745.105,I do want to note there is sort of a cross over.,115,,

809,0.97,7107.6,7113.906,I see here on the slide it looks like Patty may have moved forward one slide.,128,,
810,0.97,7113.906,7117.076,"Patty, if you can move back.",128,,
811,0.97,7117.076,7117.443,There we are.,128,,
812,0.97,7117.443,7123.583,"$500,000 of this item is coming from the sweet and beverage tax.",128,,
813,0.97,7123.583,7129.255,"Speaking of community advisory board, it seems we may need to find a different source for the $500,000.",128,,
814,0.97,7129.255,7136.896,What I will say is that fresh bucks is direct food access for so many people in our city.,128,,
815,0.97,7136.896,7148.608,This budget item would clear the wait list and address folks that have newly become eligible since the Covid-19 pandemic has begun.,128,,
816,0.97,7148.608,7161.287,"This is my top priority and understanding that $500,000 may not be able to come from the sweet and beverage tax, I am still interested in finding where that $500,000 can come from.",128,,
817,0.97,7161.287,7165.424,I will be working to identify that.,128,,
818,0.97,7165.424,7166.025,Thank you.,128,,
819,0.97,7166.025,7166.993,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,129,,
820,0.97,7166.993,7191.083,"Adding additional context as I have communicated to folks in the community and at the sweet and beverage task community advisory board, this is very much a strategy that I and our team really thought was a way to ensure the same type of services were being offered through the fresh bucks program given that fresh bucks program is already up and ready to go.",129,,
821,0.97,7191.083,7201.727,I want to be sure I publicly say this was not Councilmember Strauss' effort to try and reduce funding.,129,,
822,0.97,7201.727,7212.471,Councilmember Strauss and myself along with so many Council members here on Council have been staunch supporters of making sure that the cab recommendations are fully adhered to.,129,,
823,0.97,7212.471,7217.91,I take responsibility for not having earlier conversations to better explain how this is in alignment.,129,,
824,0.97,7217.91,7231.757,I think there is a lot of overlap with some of the investments that the sugar sweet beverage tax funding would be going to as it relates to healthy food distribution.,129,,
825,0.97,7231.757,7237.029,"If the 500,000 is objectionable, I think we still have conversations to be had.",129,,
826,0.97,7237.029,7241.934,But I support efforts as well to identify additional 500K.,129,,
827,0.97,7241.934,7242.735,What do we have?,129,,
828,0.97,7242.735,7248.774,"Over 3,000 people on the wait list now for fresh bucks?",129,,
829,0.97,7248.774,7249.909,That's correct.,130,,
830,0.97,7249.909,7250.576,"I think it's 3,358.",130,,
831,0.97,7250.576,7256.782,"With a program ready to go, already stood up, there is no question that this should be fully funded.",131,,
832,0.97,7256.782,7273.699,We will do follow up with you on the effort as well but want to be sure that I was on the record expressing support for this item and explaining the fund source here along with our on going support for the strategies that the cab have continued to bring forward.,131,,
833,0.97,7273.699,7275.368,Thank you chair.,132,,

846,0.97,7401.127,7422.181,"This is an entire category that I am so excited about and I think is really reflective of the Council's overall support for public health evidence based solutions to be implemented into our budget as we tray to care for health and safety of folks during a pandemic, we recognize their health has to be stable to begin with.",136,,
847,0.97,7422.181,7429.655,Much of the investments I see going into creating healthier communities year round and also on going.,136,,
848,0.97,7429.655,7436.629,Are there comments folks would like to lift up in the health and safety health services,136,,

927,0.97,8041.8,8054.146,"I want to thank the chair for her earlier remarks about historic nature of what the Council is doing today, not expanding police budget, as we have been talking about.",152,,
928,0.97,8054.146,8064.356,There is a strategy here not just in Reallocating resources from SPD but in investing those dollars into community.,152,,
929,0.97,8064.356,8076.334,This is important because it's true that our country has for 500 years established institutionalized racism into every system of our government.,152,,
930,0.97,8076.334,8081.74,And it will take more than one budget cycle to make a dent in fixing that.,152,,

934,0.97,8112.27,8124.816,I am excited that this Council has begun our work with this budget process to include things like Participatory budgeting and committing to community safety.,152,,
935,0.97,8124.816,8142.1,I am excited that we have made those commitments through this process so that we can ensure that there is a reallocation in a way that is more just and that really centers our neighbors and can ensure safety for everybody.,152,,

944,0.97,8186.077,8214.573,"I will also NOTE just to repeat some of the comments at the beginning very briefly, the constant of making sure there is sufficient investments in our black indigenous and people of color like communities so our black and Brown communities have alternative investments so folks have fewer interactions with police in the criminal justice system, this is a huge priority even in a few items that I mentioned this morning.",153,,
945,0.97,8214.573,8218.043,We know that the investment needed is much more than $100 million.,153,,
946,0.97,8218.043,8228.653,"If you look at the totality of what the budget is investing, it is far greater when you think about who is going to directly be impacted by the investments.",153,,
947,0.97,8228.653,8240.198,"We have looked through racial justice lens and any of the investments that have been put into and if we were to tally any that have an investment, it would be much bigger than 100 million.",153,,
948,0.97,8240.198,8279.471,"If we think about how Council is using that $100 million bucket I think folks can conceptually think of making sure we are Prioritizing the 30 million for the strategic investment fund which was a component of the sale which was the sweetener to the deal for folks who are C█Oncerned that public land was being sold and they wanted there to be a public benefit back and making sure that the public benefit equaled housing and investments in historically displaced communities, black indigenous and people of color communities, we wanted to be sure the 30 million was maintained for its original purpose.",153,,
949,0.97,8279.471,8294.419,"In addition the $10 million the city council allocated in the summer's process to be sure we are Scaling up community investments so there is an alternative model that has sufficient capacity, that grows capacity, basically see dollars for the new vision.",153,,
950,0.97,8294.419,8303.828,We wanted to follow through on all the funds that we had set aside and make sure there was a funding source that wasn't going to be in question.,153,,
951,0.97,8303.828,8304.763,That's part of it.,153,,
952,0.97,8304.763,8305.297,That's 40 million.,153,,
953,0.97,8305.297,8309.034,Look at the two buckets remaining.,153,,
954,0.97,8309.034,8313.271,The two are $30 million for Participatory budgeting and 30 million for the task force.,153,,
955,0.97,8313.271,8321.513,This is round numbers to help us better understand whether or not that $100 million threshold has been met and so much more.,153,,
956,0.97,8321.513,8324.649,That's I think an important take away.,153,,
957,0.97,8324.649,8331.089,Even though we should make sure we are not pigeon Holing ourselves into just $100 million amount.,153,,
958,0.97,8331.089,8337.062,We should actually ask what has community been asking for for a very long time?,153,,
959,0.97,8337.062,8339.698,That's housing assistance.,153,,
960,0.97,8339.698,8353.778,"That's first time homeownership options, Eviction prevention, rental assistance, making sure folks have healthy foods, job training, educational programs and security so that people can be out of cycles of generational poverty.",153,,
961,0.97,8353.778,8358.083,That on the macro level is what we have done and it is much more than 100 million.,153,,

963,0.97,8368.727,8369.928,Let's keep going.,153,,

1016,0.97,9017.641,9026.584,They testified that the status quo does not reflect a growing nationwide demand for Civilianization of certain police functions.,156,,
1017,0.97,9026.584,9032.356,"They testified our community is no longer satisfied with same OL', same OL'.",156,,
1018,0.97,9032.356,9034.859,"They demand something better, something different.",156,,
1019,0.97,9034.859,9035.593,We hear our community.,156,,
1020,0.97,9035.593,9043.134,We understand the need for change and we want to be part of the solution.,156,,
1021,0.97,9043.134,9051.108,They also wrote to us to explain that moving the P.E.O.,156,,
1022,0.97,9051.108,9058.983,Function to the new Department would allow to engage far more directly with the public in roles other than simply issuing parking citations.,156,,
1023,0.97,9058.983,9073.297,They would be able to provide services to community members that are in short supply and the multi lingual officers would be able to be easily build trust with community especially communities of color.,156,,
1024,0.97,9073.297,9076.734,Again I think this is a really Importat vision.,156,,
1025,0.97,9076.734,9096.787,I am so gratified that part of our workforce is helping us to drive that vision and I think it will be critical in working through the many issues associated with implementing that vision.,156,,
1026,0.97,9096.787,9113.971,"In total, thank you for everything that we have included in this budget and in particular, the creation of this new community safety and communications center together with the transfer of the Peos there.",156,,
1027,0.97,9113.971,9114.371,Much appreciated.,156,,
1028,0.97,9114.371,9119.043,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,157,,
1029,0.97,9119.043,9120.444,Additional comments in this section?,157,,
1030,0.97,9120.444,9120.911,Councilmember Juarez.,157,,
1031,0.97,9120.911,9121.278,Thank you.,158,,
1032,0.97,9121.278,9127.251,"First, a big thank you to Councilmember Herbold and all the hard work she's done.",158,,
1033,0.97,9127.251,9133.123,I said this and it unfortunately became a tag line and I didn't intend it to be.,158,,
1034,0.97,9133.123,9136.36,We are marking towards a plan not a percentage.,158,,
1035,0.97,9136.36,9138.929,I thank all of you for that work.,158,,
1036,0.97,9138.929,9160.718,"When I looked at what I sponsored and cosponsored on the Coson Aring there is a bunch but one that stood out was 62 on the report of traffic stops, 69 aggregating 93 police officer positions, number 74, creating in Tuukka community safety and communications center.",158,,
1037,0.97,9160.718,9166.657,But I want to address one thing that's kind of the elephant in the room.,158,,
1038,0.97,9166.657,9174.365,Number 65 is a request for out of order layoffs for 35 police officers.,158,,
1039,0.97,9174.365,9184.141,I think it is important to say that it is a request and we need to bargain the changes.,158,,
1040,0.97,9184.141,9184.842,The bargaining is coming.,158,,
1041,0.97,9184.842,9200.691,"I think it's fair to say in November as opposed to in July that we understand, we know, and we are going to move forward that we will reduce the number of police officers.",158,,
1042,0.97,9200.691,9202.826,More police officers doesn't mean more protection.,158,,
1043,0.97,9202.826,9206.096,For some communities it can possibly mean death.,158,,
1044,0.97,9206.096,9219.31,"With the reckoning, with the recognition, with the plan moving forward, I am happy to support these positions in the budget package.",158,,
1045,0.97,9219.31,9262.886,"I look forward to working with chief Diez, executive Councilmember Herbold who chairs public safety and Councilmember Gonzalez, former chair, and the five members making up the labor relations board for the city Council and some of the changes that are going to come about with having some community partners, our partners at the CPC, Oig, what we call our accountability partners at the table when we actually look at how we refashion, Rebalance our police Department to fit community needs.",158,,
1046,0.97,9262.886,9264.188,So thank you.,158,,
1047,0.97,9264.188,9265.122,Appreciate that.,159,,
1048,0.97,9265.122,9273.097,We appreciate your support for these items and more.,159,,
1049,0.97,9273.097,9273.564,Additional comments?,159,,
1050,0.97,9273.564,9280.571,Council President Gonzalez and then Councilmember Pedersen.,159,,
1051,0.97,9280.571,9282.006,Good afternoon.,160,,
1052,0.97,9282.006,9287.911,Thank you for an opportunity to just share a few reflections here.,160,,
1053,0.97,9287.911,9298.555,I won't Belabor the point because we had robust conversations about each of these items in prior budget committee hearings.,160,,
1054,0.97,9298.555,9317.741,I just want to again Express gratitude to the chair Mosqueda for including many of the items I put forward in this section and I appreciate both Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Juarez's comments already.,160,,
1055,0.97,9317.741,9349.406,I do want to acknowledge the budget action request around 35 out of order layoffs and really acknowledge that we in the labor relations policy committee context have been working together with the executive around accomplishing the intent around pursuing how to accomplish out of order layoffs.,160,,
1056,0.97,9349.406,9360.417,I do think this is an opportunity for us to work Collaboratively with the executive on the concept and construct of out of order layoffs that are proposed here.,160,,
1057,0.97,9360.417,9363.52,This will be of course for 2021.,160,,
1058,0.97,9363.52,9387.044,We have an opportunity in our labor relations context to dig into that work and make sure that we have a plan in place to effectuate Council's intent as it relates to that proposal brought forward by Councilmember Herbold and I am supportive of that action.,160,,
1059,0.97,9387.044,9412.97,"Then I just wanted to quickly mention on some of my proposals, specifically those related to capturing savings from vacancies at SPD and capturing future potential savings, I think this is again a reminder for colleagues and for the general public that these are ordinary things that we normally do during our budget process.",160,,
1060,0.97,9412.97,9435.659,"We take a look at what the police Department has been forecasting in terms of what they think they might be able to hire when we received the Mayor's budget of course, it was a point in time calculation that we received after digging into the budget further, we realized we could capture additional Savings and we are doing that here.",160,,
1061,0.97,9435.659,9506.296,"So while we have gone through that exercise in the past, it is obviously different now and I do think it is important to recognize that both the $6.1 million reduction to SPD to capture vacancy Savings and Reallocate to Participatory budgeting processes as well as $5 million proviso and future potential salary savings as a result of unexpected and unanticipated attrition are important towards accomplishing Council's goal of not further expanding Seattle police Department especially in advance of the interdepartmental task force body of work that is currently occurring under the Mayor's executive order that is really under taking a lot of the Nitty gritty functional analysis related to what is to law enforcement and what divisions are necessary in order for the need to provide public safety services.",160,,
1062,0.97,9506.296,9514.071,I feel good about these budget actions included.,160,,
1063,0.97,9514.071,9532.356,I feel good about the fact that the savings will be dedicated to the Participatory budgeting process in a meaningful way that will allow us to continue to invest in the community led safety programs that we talked about in the few slides before these.,160,,
1064,0.97,9532.356,9544.701,Thank you again to all of my colleagues who cosponsored these budget actions and special thanks to the budget chair for including them in her initial package.,160,,
1065,0.97,9544.701,9545.502,"Thank you, Madam chair.",160,,
1066,0.97,9545.502,9550.374,Thank you very much Council President.,161,,
1067,0.97,9550.374,9551.775,Additional comments or questions?,161,,
1068,0.97,9551.775,9554.945,"I am sorry Councilmember Pedersen, you were in the Cue.",161,,
1069,0.97,9554.945,9555.546,Please go ahead.,161,,
1070,0.97,9555.546,9557.481,Thank you.,162,,
1071,0.97,9557.481,9564.021,I am also eager to redeploy substantial dollars to improve public safety and community wellness.,162,,
1072,0.97,9564.021,9575.499,Ideally we would first have more results and the public safety plan from the Participatory budgeting process and Mayor's task force before we cut so much today.,162,,
1073,0.97,9575.499,9584.741,Seattle times recently reported on the relatively low number of officers Seattle has when compared to other cities.,162,,
1074,0.97,9584.741,9591.615,"The attrition, new information since summer is that the attrition and loss of trained officers is much higher than expected.",162,,
1075,0.97,9591.615,9599.323,Some of the key reforms from the consent decree require funding and people to implement those reforms.,162,,
1076,0.97,9599.323,9610.834,"I also want to make sure response times for priority one, emergency 911 calls are fast, appropriately fast for priority one calls.",162,,
1077,0.97,9610.834,9618.408,Police Union contract of course needs to be revamped to increase flexibility and save more funds for alternative investments.,162,,
1078,0.97,9618.408,9630.12,I will be asking central staff for details on the net impact of all the cuts as we hope to scale up alternative solutions to improve public safety.,162,,
1079,0.97,9630.12,9631.822,Thank you.,162,,
1080,0.97,9631.822,9639.062,"Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Gonzalez, reactions, comments?",163,,
1081,0.97,9639.062,9640.731,Thank you.,164,,
1082,0.97,9640.731,9653.41,"I failed to mention in my points that my Overarching approach at this point, I believe, Aligns with everything Councilmember Pedersen just said.",164,,
1083,0.97,9653.41,9670.627,"We took actions over the summer budgeting process that, had they been implemented, would have resulted in 1,322 police officers.",164,,
1084,0.97,9670.627,9714.838,"These actions, a combination of the actions, does not get us to funded positions below the 1,322 officers precisely because I did not want to take further steps to reduce the number of officers in the police Department without, beyond what we had committed to over summer, without first working to take these next steps around funding the infrastructure for additional Nonpolice crisis response.",164,,
1085,0.97,9714.838,9715.138,Thank you.,164,,
1086,0.97,9715.138,9716.506,Council President.,165,,
1087,0.97,9716.506,9717.074,Thank you.,166,,
1088,0.97,9717.074,9723.013,I also feel the need to respond to Councilmember Pedersen's comments.,166,,
1089,0.97,9723.013,9730.787,"The first comment related to Seattle times article, I want to caution us as Council members about that particular piece.",166,,
1090,0.97,9730.787,9749.973,"Of course when we had SPD present during our budget committee process, I spent a considerable amount of time questioning both Dr. Fisher and chief Diez about how we evaluate, analyze, and look at what our staffing needs are at the Seattle police Department.",166,,
1091,0.97,9749.973,9771.795,One of the things chief Diez said that is completely omitted and not Referenced in the article is the city of Seattle and Seattle police Department in particular does not use a per capita measure for determining what staffing levels should be over sworn personnel in our city.,166,,
1092,0.97,9771.795,9774.331,We use a combination of different factors.,166,,
1093,0.97,9774.331,9778.769,But we do not use a straight per capita formula.,166,,
1094,0.97,9778.769,9785.976,"In other words, per X number of people in the city of Seattle, we should have X number of sworn officers.",166,,
1095,0.97,9785.976,9797.42,That is not the formula that the Seattle police Department uses in order to project what its staffing should be in order to meet the public safety needs of the people of Seattle.,166,,
1096,0.97,9797.42,9830.954,"I want to caution us about that particular article and sort of the underlying Analytical assumption that it relied on in order to come to the conclusion that SPD is ""under staffed ."" Secondly, as it relates to proposals I have put forward which seem to be the subject of Councilmember Pedersen's comments, I have proposed to aggregate 93 police officer positions in the budget.",166,,
1097,0.97,9830.954,9841.231,I have also proposed to reduce the appropriation for staffing at SPD by $6.1 million.,166,,
1098,0.97,9841.231,9874.831,"In addition to that, should there be unexpected, Unforecasted attrition in 2021, I have signaled to the police Department through my $5 million proviso that it was Council's intent to capture $5 million of the potential salary savings through unexpected attrition in order to capture dollars for Participatory budgeting process that will lead to Community-Led safety programming and investments.",166,,
1099,0.97,9874.831,9890.347,"I just want to say that in our conversation with Council central staff, I want to read the information I recently got related to the particular numbers.",166,,
1100,0.97,9890.347,9898.822,"Greg Doss wrote to me recently Monday at 11:50 a.m., following analysis relating to the numbers.",166,,
1101,0.97,9898.822,9903.96,He writes SPD incurred significant number of unplanned separations after Mayor Trans mid her proposed budget.,166,,
1102,0.97,9903.96,9915.372,In response to the change SPD developed updated staffing plan that assumes 25 net new hires.,166,,
1103,0.97,9915.372,9918.775,That's 114 hires less than 89 projected separations.,166,,
1104,0.97,9918.775,9937.26,"According to the staffing plan, again staffing plan created by Seattle police Department, according to the staffing plan, Seattle police Department will have at the end of 2021 a total of 1,311 fully trained officers and 1,247 officers in service.",166,,
1105,0.97,9937.26,9949.205,"The latter accounting for projection of officers that will be out on disability, military service, or administrative leave for a total of 64 sworn officers in the category.",166,,
1106,0.97,9949.205,9954.811,Balancing package would not affect SPD hiring plan and would result in the same staffing levels.,166,,
1107,0.97,9954.811,9965.455,"In response to the unplanned attrition, the balancing package makes a $6.1 million adjustment reduction in funding for 43 annual average Ftes.",166,,
1108,0.97,9965.455,9979.502,"This adjustment is made because SPD has indicated that its updated hiring plan can only achieve an annual average of 1,357 Ftes.",166,,
1109,0.97,9979.502,10025.382,I believe that the balancing package as we are discussing it is a reasonable responsible response to the data that we have received directly from the Department and analyzed by Council central staff that has led to an obvious opportunity to capture these additional salary savings resulting from the vacancies that we could dedicate to Participatory budgeting processes that will Prioritize Council's interest in supporting Community-Led safety programs for the future.,166,,
1110,0.97,10025.382,10033.857,"Lastly, I will say as it relates to the aggregation, those are positions that are currently vacant and unfunded.",166,,
1111,0.97,10033.857,10069.025,"My goal with proposing that aggregation was to make sure that, again, we weren't growing the police Department, you know, or allowing for opportunity to further expand the Footprint of the police Department in advance of the conclusion of the work that is currently happening as it relates to functional analysis being done by Mayor's Idt which, you know, Council has a seat at the table and is participating in the robust functional analysis.",166,,
1112,0.97,10069.025,10069.826,"Thank you, chair.",166,,
1113,0.97,10069.826,10071.594,Thank you very much.,167,,
1114,0.97,10071.594,10078.968,The next hand I saw was Councilmember Sewant.,167,,
1115,0.97,10078.968,10079.269,Thank you.,167,,
1116,0.97,10079.269,10079.669,Good afternoon.,167,,
1117,0.97,10079.669,10090.413,I just wanted to add that my office of course need less to say supports all of these reductions in the bloated police budget.,168,,
1118,0.97,10090.413,10115.705,"I appreciate these items being included in the proposed balancing package but also as I have continued to promise, my office will be bringing budget amendment for final votes to Defund police by 50% as demanded by hundreds organizing with people's budget and solidarity budget which as we know includes community organizations but also a large number of union members and socialists.",168,,
1119,0.97,10115.705,10116.005,Thank you.,168,,
1120,0.97,10116.005,10121.511,Thank you very much Councilmember Sewant.,169,,
1121,0.97,10121.511,10121.978,Additional comments?,169,,
1122,0.97,10121.978,10125.181,Thank you all for your items here.,169,,
1123,0.97,10125.181,10136.626,"As we mentioned at the beginning, this is a complete package of all but one item in the SPD area because we are seeking just a little bit of additional input on that.",169,,
1124,0.97,10136.626,10140.497,"Overall, every item put forward was included in the proposal.",169,,
1125,0.97,10140.497,10172.095,"I appreciate all the work you all have done to make sure that we are both taking steps forward to reducing the presence and ways in which traditional policing is done in Seattle as we also scale up, mostly important, scale up, investments in under invest the community so there are Preventative strategies like housing, education, violence reduction, prevention strategies in place and we are also Scaling up interventions.",169,,
1126,0.97,10172.095,10187.277,If folks have a need for harm reduction strategies and alternatives to policing we have created those alternatives through Community-Led strategies and community led strategies that are black and Brown led.,169,,
1127,0.97,10187.277,10203.159,"Very optimistic about the investments we are making and recognize much more will be coming when we get feedback from the Participatory budgeting process that has a place holder now of $30 million, the vast majority coming from reductions to SPD.",169,,
1128,0.97,10203.159,10217.84,I want to flag for folks that we have been accurate in reflection of how much is available in 2021 being $30 million immediately and then if some of the Provisos do materialize then there would be additional there.,169,,
1129,0.97,10217.84,10228.318,We wanted to be accurately reflecting what was available beginning in our January 2021 time frame so that the calendar year was reflective of the dollars.,169,,
1130,0.97,10228.318,10230.787,"Again, did I mention this at the beginning?",169,,
1131,0.97,10230.787,10251.341,"Want to mention again as others have, this is the first year that the city council is not expanding Seattle police Department's budget, and that's in large part due to the racial reckoning that's happening, civil rights up rising, and the on going call for action that's obviously something I commented on at the beginning.",169,,
1132,0.97,10251.341,10255.511,"If there is frustration that this is not moving fast enough, we understand that.",169,,
1133,0.97,10255.511,10277.033,We are also frustrated about some of the road blocks but are working actively as Council members have talked about actively to try to address the road blocks and we will keep working with you as we work towards a more just equitable public safety model in the city and in doing so in coordination with other cities around the country.,169,,
1134,0.97,10277.033,10280.236,Seeing no additional comments thanks again for all the feedback on this section.,169,,
1135,0.97,10280.236,10289.245,Let's go ahead and go to the next section.,169,,
1136,0.97,10289.245,10293.216,We are moving into the housed category.,170,,
1137,0.97,10293.216,10296.085,This first sub category is outreach.,170,,
1138,0.97,10296.085,10310.767,"Items 76 through 81 on the agenda that reflect combined total of 5.6 million of investments to expand outreach services, increase funding for publicly accessible.",170,,
1139,0.97,10310.767,10320.543,The first item would add about $1.1 million to human services Department to increase homelessness outreach services and imposes for Provisos.,170,,
1140,0.97,10320.543,10352.041,"I will NOTE here that this action combines four separate proposals presented previously to provide outreach services specifically in Northwest Seattle, Lake City, West Seattle, South Park, adds additional $450,000 to increase the amount of money for outreach services and other flexible funding for homeless service providers.",170,,
1141,0.97,10352.041,10367.123,"This action is by Councilmember Strauss but other actions merged were also sponsored by Councilmembers Herbold, Juarez, and Morales.",170,,

1148,0.97,10416.305,10434.791,Item 79 would add about 110 think dollars and in Hsd for grants and contracts administration and imposes proviso.,170,,
1149,0.97,10434.791,10439.896,"80 would add $286,000 to ...",170,,
1150,0.97,10439.896,10442.698,Sponsored by Councilmember Morales.,170,,
1151,0.97,10442.698,10450.339,"Item 81 would add $100,000 to Spu for publicly accessible sink program sponsored by Councilmember Morales.",170,,
1152,0.97,10450.339,10461.45,I think I failed to say 79 would add a position in human services Department is sponsored by chair Mosqueda.,170,,
1153,0.97,10461.45,10462.385,That's very helpful.,171,,
1154,0.97,10462.385,10464.22,Thank you very much.,171,,
1155,0.97,10464.22,10469.826,I was looking at item 79 thinking now what is that doing?,171,,
1156,0.97,10469.826,10478.935,"Just so folks know, the contract positions have been incredibly overwhelmed with the amount of work that is on them.",171,,
1157,0.97,10478.935,10485.741,"We want to support our 17 members, city staff who have more than anticipated work loads and not enough staff to do it.",171,,
1158,0.97,10485.741,10499.222,We are talking about contracts out for supporting key homeless service providers in addition to the work they're doing to getting contracts out the door for public safety efforts we supported this summer and so much more regular work.,171,,
1159,0.97,10499.222,10517.907,"This is FTE to help support the work that will support community efforts, help streamline getting dollars we have provided out the door in a more quick fashion and really wanted to be sure you understood what that was because even for me, it raised a question mark.",171,,
1160,0.97,10517.907,10520.476,That is what that alphabet soup there means.,171,,
1161,0.97,10520.476,10524.013,Other items that you would like to highlight?,171,,
1162,0.97,10524.013,10526.883,I will do two notes.,171,,
1163,0.97,10526.883,10547.703,"Item 76, which is the first bullet here for increased outreach and item 77, our second bullet related to hope, I hope that it is accurate to say these are place holders to indicate Council's strong interest in making sure that the items do get Finessed and finalized over the next week.",171,,
1164,0.97,10547.703,10579.435,"We want to make sure that there is a hope program as articulated by Councilmember Morales and others that is our Nonpolice led strategy to engaging with community and Councilmember Lewis was articulate in his discussion about earlier piece of legislation as well, similar framework as we have a place holder for those conversations as they continue as well as the over $1 million that reflects all four of the Councilmembers' interests in having additional outreach in our areas.",171,,
1165,0.97,10579.435,10592.081,"We will continue to work with each office and providers a the large to be sure that the language is complimentary to the hope efforts and I know there are many conversations happening now including with the executive office, deputy Mayor.",171,,
1166,0.97,10592.081,10594.817,I look forward to continuing to hear more about those.,171,,
1167,0.97,10594.817,10614.937,It was really important for us to continue to signal support for the hope program and the direction that Councilmember Morales and others have articulated and desire for many Council members to be sure there was geographic specific support for areas across the city.,171,,
1168,0.97,10614.937,10616.305,Any additional comments?,171,,
1169,0.97,10616.305,10616.806,Councilmember Herbold.,171,,
1170,0.97,10616.806,10618.407,Thank you so much.,172,,
1171,0.97,10618.407,10625.715,I want to also thank Councilmember Strauss for taking the lead on this.,172,,
1172,0.97,10625.715,10651.407,"This is really important work as stated to shift to a new more successful approach away from the navigation team, a team that when we are not in a Covid emergency is very focused on Removals.",172,,
1173,0.97,10651.407,10654.41,We really want Removals to be option of last resort.,172,,
1174,0.97,10654.41,10660.85,We know outreach is no replacement for sufficient Noncongregate shelter space and affordable housing.,172,,
1175,0.97,10660.85,10665.721,This proposed budget continues to invest in Scaling up resources as well.,172,,
1176,0.97,10665.721,10672.128,Folks that live unsheltered can have healthy safe alternative to their tent.,172,,
1177,0.97,10672.128,10705.961,"But in the absence of sufficient affordable housing and healthy shelter space immediately available, outreach can help connect to other needed services such as programs like lead or Healthcare, identify need for city services such as garbage removal, help encampment residents make changes to address safety or hazard concerns, to minimize likelihood that ...",172,,
1178,0.97,10705.961,10715.337,Build relationships and provide information to people who live or work near Encampments and help broker positive relationships among neighbors.,172,,
1179,0.97,10715.337,10728.451,"I also want to recognize central staff, work to pull together multiple outreach proposals in my colleagues for their willingness to do that as well.",172,,
1180,0.97,10728.451,10728.751,Thank you.,172,,
1181,0.97,10728.751,10732.354,Thank you very much.,173,,
1182,0.97,10732.354,10732.855,Councilmember Morales.,173,,
1183,0.97,10732.855,10733.756,Please go ahead.,173,,
1184,0.97,10733.756,10734.123,Thank you.,174,,
1185,0.97,10734.123,10746.001,I want to thank my colleagues who are ...,174,,
1186,0.97,10746.001,10753.008,We think it is important that we are moving more toward the approach.,174,,
1187,0.97,10753.008,10758.114,It is more humane and will be more productive as we have heard through outreach workers.,174,,
1188,0.97,10758.114,10769.358,The ability for them to have the time to build relationships with folks is critical to the success of moving into more stable situations.,174,,
1189,0.97,10769.358,10776.332,I do want to say my staff has done quick analysis of the clean cities initiative.,174,,
1190,0.97,10776.332,10787.71,There is obviously overlap in some of the elements there and I am happy to talk with the executive and work with Councilmember Juarez.,174,,
1191,0.97,10787.71,10789.578,There are certainly budget neutral items there.,174,,
1192,0.97,10789.578,10800.723,"We know that the maintenance Jamborees, in addition to sounding like a lot of fun, provides really important service in our parks and our neighborhoods.",174,,
1193,0.97,10800.723,10808.931,I would also be interested in learning a little bit more about these cross departmental programs.,174,,
1194,0.97,10808.931,10811.433,It is a big budget ask.,174,,
1195,0.97,10811.433,10828.684,I am also wondering about potential for actually employing some of our homeless neighbors to do some of the work since they have the lived experience that can be really critical to making some of this work successful.,174,,
1196,0.97,10828.684,10832.888,So I look forward to those conversations.,174,,
1197,0.97,10832.888,10836.725,Thank you very much.,175,,
1198,0.97,10836.725,10839.228,Are there additional comments?,175,,
1199,0.97,10839.228,10840.329,Councilmember Pedersen?,175,,
1200,0.97,10840.329,10842.598,"Thank you, chair.",176,,
1201,0.97,10842.598,10856.245,"Just to clarify, Repurpose for new homeless outreach and provider Ecosystem, was that the accord that was reached with deputy Mayor six Keller and Councilmember Lewis?",176,,
1202,0.97,10856.245,10863.252,I am trying to be sure it's the same thing we are talking about or is it different?,176,,
1203,0.97,10863.252,10866.956,I see Jeff Sims also on the line.,177,,
1204,0.97,10866.956,10874.263,"Councilmember Morales if you wanted to start with context, that would be fine.",177,,
1205,0.97,10874.263,10874.53,Sure.,178,,
1206,0.97,10874.53,10891.013,As you recall the last time we had this conversation--I have lost track of time--Councilmember Lewis acknowledged or expressed interest.,178,,
1207,0.97,10891.013,10894.25,So we have been talking with Hsd.,178,,
1208,0.97,10894.25,10894.917,The short answer is yes.,178,,
1209,0.97,10894.917,10911.367,I think part of the compromise was moving from five Ftes which was our original proposal to the considered as part of the restructure so that the positions are still there.,178,,
1210,0.97,10911.367,10921.744,We're working to be sure that the positions don't do the outreach per se but are really supporting kind of the back office piece of the work that needs to Happe there.,178,,
1211,0.97,10921.744,10926.148,"Jeff, I don't know if you want to add anything.",178,,
1212,0.97,10926.148,10931.887,I don't have a substantial more to add.,179,,
1213,0.97,10931.887,10933.822,I can add follow up.,180,,
1214,0.97,10933.822,10938.427,Just a quick follow up.,180,,
1215,0.97,10938.427,10939.962,Please go ahead.,181,,
1216,0.97,10939.962,10940.396,Thanks.,181,,
1217,0.97,10940.396,10948.437,Does this proposal include any sort of performance measures or tracking where we are tracking the results?,182,,
1218,0.97,10948.437,10949.872,Is it Hsd tracking results?,182,,
1219,0.97,10949.872,10955.044,Since we are trying something new I want to be sure we are tracking outcomes.,182,,
1220,0.97,10955.044,10964.353,I am assuming Hsd would be doing that as well.,182,,
1221,0.97,10964.353,10966.855,I will take a stab at it.,183,,
1222,0.97,10966.855,10969.091,To be clear this isn't anything that is new.,183,,
1223,0.97,10969.091,10973.062,We already contract with the outreach providers.,183,,
1224,0.97,10973.062,10989.044,"The work that Hsd staff would be doing is the contract management working on the Deliverables, coordinating different programs that we were talking about, Spu, purple bag program for example.",183,,
1225,0.97,10989.044,11001.256,So the work would be some of the--this is all obviously still part of the ongoing discussion.,183,,
1226,0.97,11001.256,11006.995,The framework and original position descriptions that we had are still being discussed.,183,,
1227,0.97,11006.995,11025.581,"But in general the idea is that there would be something doing data analysis, collecting the information you are talking about, and also positions would include contract management with service providers who are the folks who know how to do this work best.",183,,
1228,0.97,11025.581,11027.85,"Councilmember Pedersen, did that answer?",184,,
1229,0.97,11027.85,11028.617,Sounds like a yes.,184,,
1230,0.97,11028.617,11033.222,"Yes, thank you.",185,,
1231,0.97,11033.222,11033.889,Thank you.,186,,
1232,0.97,11033.889,11034.39,Councilmember Herbold.,186,,
1233,0.97,11034.39,11036.492,Then we have alley with clarification.,186,,
1234,0.97,11036.492,11036.825,Thank you.,187,,
1235,0.97,11036.825,11063.519,"I wanted to add I believe the budget action itself States that the team would act within the Perimeters of a framework developed by Mayor Council residents of Seattle, those living outside the framework as E-Mailed to Council offices on October 26, 2020.",187,,
1236,0.97,11063.519,11064.153,Thank you.,188,,
1237,0.97,11064.153,11068.457,Did you have a comment Councilmember Lewis.,188,,
1238,0.97,11068.457,11069.024,Yes.,189,,
1239,0.97,11069.024,11100.189,"Thank you, just to jump in real quick and to speak to some of Councilmember Pedersen's concerns, I think we are getting towards a pretty good place and specific per Visas that will be attached to kind of implementing the bounds that were identified in the framework are going to get us to a pretty good place on the new outreach strategy.",189,,
1240,0.97,11100.189,11130.519,I know that Councilmember Morales is very engaged and that is informing the process as shaping the next step in developing this new framework based and collaborative outreach strategy . I would further say providers contract through Hsd and my understanding is the contracts are attached to certain performance and review Metrics.,189,,
1241,0.97,11130.519,11141.396,I think there is already an accountability model that is in place that this will be building on top of.,189,,
1242,0.97,11141.396,11145.667,I don't know if there are talks about putting something more supplementary.,189,,
1243,0.97,11145.667,11158.981,I would add that the framework E-Mailed does identify certain areas where there are provider responsibilities and provider expectations as part of the division of labor outlined.,189,,
1244,0.97,11158.981,11172.427,We aren't quite finished yesterday with exactly what this will ultimately look like but it is going in a good direction for a collaborative result.,189,,
1245,0.97,11172.427,11172.728,Great.,190,,
1246,0.97,11172.728,11178.0,Thank you very much Councilmember Lewis.,190,,
1247,0.97,11178.0,11179.401,"Alley, any additional clarification or items?",190,,
1248,0.97,11179.401,11186.508,I wanted to know something related to clean cities proposal that has been Referenced multiple times.,191,,
1249,0.97,11186.508,11191.513,We look forward to work with Council members if you are proposing changes.,191,,
1250,0.97,11191.513,11196.852,"I just want to note on the proposal in particular, we have done initial looking into it.",191,,
1251,0.97,11196.852,11205.861,It appears to be a bit of a concept at this point for how much funding would be needed to pursue initiatives.,191,,
1252,0.97,11205.861,11216.471,Our understanding is executive has not created all the implementation details for how this would be deployed and are creating interdepartmental team to discuss.,191,,
1253,0.97,11216.471,11219.975,We've asked questions to get details and to understand that.,191,,
1254,0.97,11219.975,11235.39,"While what was delivered to the Council was detailed, there is still a lot to work out and we have some recommendations on how Council members may want to propose this.",191,,
1255,0.97,11235.39,11248.437,"I wanted to flag that while it appeared detailed, there is more work to do to fully understand the costs and how resources would be deployed.",191,,
1256,0.97,11248.437,11251.206,Thank you Councilmember Juarez and thanks alley.,192,,
1257,0.97,11251.206,11253.108,Thank you.,193,,
1258,0.97,11253.108,11254.309,You are reading my mind.,193,,
1259,0.97,11254.309,11261.183,I wanted to follow up on that without being a dead horse on the clean cities.,193,,
1260,0.97,11261.183,11277.299,Councilmember Morales raised a good point about the employment factor for outreach for items 76 and 77 and what Councilmember Herbold shared about getting away from a Nonpolice led strategy to address homelessness.,193,,
1261,0.97,11277.299,11286.208,For me both sides of the equation are employees to do outreach with our unsheltered folks to keep them safe and to get them to services.,193,,
1262,0.97,11286.208,11321.343,"The other side of the equation is employees within parks and outside of parks, hopefully new employees, that can be deployed in a rapid response team to actually get on the ground and clear up and clean up thrash pick Upcleaning up in the parks and open spaces, to help businesses, particularly small businesses which we have been hearing in districts manage issues of trash accumulation, picking up needles, all toes things that are happening.",193,,
1263,0.97,11321.343,11321.843,We have two things.,193,,
1264,0.97,11321.843,11336.191,"We need people to do the outreach and we need people inside parks, outside of parks, hopefully new positions to come in and get out there to do litter abatement and to stand up a rapid response team.",193,,
1265,0.97,11336.191,11343.265,"I think the last thing I wanted to add, because I am chair of parks, is I talked to the executive.",193,,
1266,0.97,11343.265,11345.767,I believe I shared this with Madam chair.,193,,
1267,0.97,11345.767,11349.504,Correct me if I am wrong.,193,,
1268,0.97,11349.504,11353.575,Looking at key improvements in Park overall Cleanliness.,193,,
1269,0.97,11353.575,11358.814,That's where we are really hurting.,193,,
1270,0.97,11358.814,11370.892,"This Summerso many people were angry and calling parks and calling parks saying this isn't getting cleaned, this isn't being mowed, this isn't being picked up.",193,,
1271,0.97,11370.892,11373.228,"As you know, our resources were going other places.",193,,
1272,0.97,11373.228,11385.974,"That's why I think clean cities, where it overlaps, great, in the budget that Madam chair is proposing but I am looking where it overlaps and the pieces we didn't hit.",193,,
1273,0.97,11385.974,11394.316,What I am seeing in the pieces we didn't get is the rapid response piece of actually physically going out and cleaning up the spots.,193,,
1274,0.97,11394.316,11399.087,Not removing people but cleaning up the open spaces in the parks because that's what we are hearing from community.,193,,
1275,0.97,11399.087,11402.19,This is what we are hearing from residents.,193,,
1276,0.97,11402.19,11408.563,This is also what we are hearing from unsheltered and certainly from our small business community.,193,,
1277,0.97,11408.563,11412.1,Thank you.,193,,
1278,0.97,11412.1,11413.935,Thank you Councilmember Juarez.,194,,
1279,0.97,11413.935,11417.105,"Jeff, did you have clarification?",195,,
1280,0.97,11417.105,11418.373,Then I see Council President.,195,,
1281,0.97,11418.373,11418.84,Please go ahead.,195,,
1282,0.97,11418.84,11424.78,I do have one clarification to Councilmember Pedersen's question.,196,,
1283,0.97,11424.78,11434.456,"Is it correct that contracted providers are held to certain Metrics, primarily the portion of clients that interact with referred to shelter.",196,,
1284,0.97,11434.456,11460.615,"To be sure a nuance to your question wasn't misunderstood, the hope team itself, framework guidelines of expectations and in you strategy hope would pursue but are not specific performance Metrics discussed either in the framework or directly eluded to, those would need to be developed at this point likely outside of Cva since there is no reference to that.",196,,
1285,0.97,11460.615,11460.882,Okay.,197,,
1286,0.97,11460.882,11465.854,"Council President Gonzalez, I see you are up next.",197,,
1287,0.97,11465.854,11468.123,"Thank you, chair.",198,,
1288,0.97,11468.123,11484.172,"Just really quickly, in looking at the document that we received from the Mayor on the clean cities initiative proposal, I wanted to acknowledge a couple things.",198,,
1289,0.97,11484.172,11491.246,One is that Unfortunately we received the proposal very late in our budget process.,198,,
1290,0.97,11491.246,11499.821,So I acknowledge that that is likely the primary reason why it's not reflected in the chair's rebalancing package.,198,,
1291,0.97,11499.821,11510.832,It is a little difficult to include or consider the proposals when they come in rather late.,198,,
1292,0.97,11510.832,11542.531,"Secondly, in my review of the proposal, and I haven't spent an exorbitant amount of time with it, it is about four pages long, one of the things that occurred to me is we haven't had the benefit of having Council central staff's analysis of the proposal and haven't really had the ordinary back and forth with the executive around what this proposal is or isn't.",198,,
1293,0.97,11542.531,11600.555,"So to that end, I suppose tagging onto what Councilmember Juarez already said, I hope there is an opportunity through this budget process now to figure out if there is a way to use form C to signal Council's interest in evaluating the proposal and in identifying how this Rebalance package meets some of the functional needs identified in the clean cities initiative proposal and for those that may not already be incorporated in Rebalance package, what the path forward is for providing support for those functions.",198,,
1294,0.97,11600.555,11604.192,I think I will speak for myself.,198,,
1295,0.97,11604.192,11621.142,I certainly agree that there is an ongoing need for increased cleaning on publicly owned properties and lands across Seattle.,198,,
1296,0.97,11621.142,11626.281,I believe that's been a need since I ran for this position in the first place since 2015.,198,,
1297,0.97,11626.281,11631.386,I think there is a lot of alignment in terms of Overarching intent and goals here.,198,,
1298,0.97,11631.386,11653.108,"I Thursday into Friday the tricky part is in this sorted of budgeting process, how do we find a way to move this body of work forward acknowledging that we are literally a couple weeks away from voting on the final budget and we just received this late last week.",198,,
1299,0.97,11653.108,11678.633,"So if there is an opportunity to work with Councilmember Juarez and with others and with you chair on identifying how we can par some of this out and how we can effectively establish a work plan to continue to Prioritize this body of work for the public health and safety of all our residents in the city, I would certainly be interested in pursuing that kind of an opportunity.",198,,
1300,0.97,11678.633,11681.936,Thank you very much Council President.,199,,
1301,0.97,11681.936,11702.057,"As a reminder to folks, including folks in the executives office, the process we had committed to early on was to be sure there were no items that hadn't been discussed publicly at the committee and also when we received the letter having the budget pretty well baked at that point, there was a lot of overlap, a lot of cross over.",199,,
1302,0.97,11702.057,11704.692,As Council members have spoken to today.,199,,
1303,0.97,11704.692,11708.697,I think outstanding questions are how much have we invested in the areas?,199,,
1304,0.97,11708.697,11712.534,Are there additional areas to be invested?,199,,
1305,0.97,11712.534,11717.472,Obviously there is ongoing need as Council members have spoken to.,199,,
1306,0.97,11717.472,11726.715,"As alley articulated, getting a better sense of whether or not the universe of dollars requested is a fully baked concept and if those are sufficient for the items identified.",199,,
1307,0.97,11726.715,11747.502,I like the idea Council President that you put out about sort of putting a place holder as we think about how we continue to implement various strategies once we have identified full universe of areas where we may want to supplement what this budget has already put forward.,199,,
1308,0.97,11747.502,11748.303,Additional comments?,199,,
1309,0.97,11748.303,11750.271,Thank you Councilmember Gonzalez.,200,,
1310,0.97,11750.271,11759.914,What we shared this morning was some of what you just shared on doing a form C. I think it is wonderful that you pointed it out.,200,,
1311,0.97,11759.914,11771.86,"We had read it in detail, not just the Mayor's proposal that came down on November 2 but director Ben noble, city budget director, his memo as well.",200,,
1312,0.97,11771.86,11789.21,"What I did was cross Referenced those tracking warmer weather and why we had a new forecast that was different than August which of course brought us to the fact that we had an increase, additional money, and then cross Referencing that with chair Mosqueda's budget that came out yesterday.",200,,
1313,0.97,11789.21,11789.477,I agree.,200,,
1314,0.97,11789.477,11791.746,I think we have shared this again.,200,,
1315,0.97,11791.746,11802.056,There is a lot of overlap of the five items that Councilmember Mosqueda has put forward and the seven points.,200,,
1316,0.97,11802.056,11810.932,"The seven points that the executive proposed which should probably end up in form C, a lot of that is absorbed in what Madam chair has presented.",200,,
1317,0.97,11810.932,11812.867,I have been keeping a running tab.,200,,
1318,0.97,11812.867,11818.84,I don't think you want to see my chicken scratch.,200,,
1319,0.97,11818.84,11820.808,Oh take that off.,200,,
1320,0.97,11820.808,11822.777,Oh that got there.,200,,
1321,0.97,11822.777,11823.511,South park.,200,,
1322,0.97,11823.511,11826.347,"Great, that was in there.",200,,
1323,0.97,11826.347,11826.648,Good job.,200,,
1324,0.97,11826.648,11829.751,You don't need me to tell you that Madam chair.,200,,
1325,0.97,11829.751,11831.286,But a lot of that looks great.,200,,
1326,0.97,11831.286,11836.691,There is stuff on the clean cities stuff that I think we need to address.,200,,
1327,0.97,11836.691,11844.165,I support what Council President Gonzalez just shared with us.,200,,
1328,0.97,11844.165,11844.465,Thank you.,200,,
1329,0.97,11844.465,11852.173,Thank you so much any additional comments on this item or any item on this category?,201,,
1330,0.97,11852.173,11852.373,Okay.,201,,
1331,0.97,11852.373,11853.541,I am seeing none.,201,,
1332,0.97,11853.541,11864.252,Should we take a pause here and take a break before going on to the other items?,201,,
1333,0.97,11864.252,11868.189,That sounds great.,202,,
1334,0.97,11868.189,11868.856,Wonderful.,203,,

1339,0.97,11885.473,11888.543,And that will be at 2:00 P.M.,203,,

1344,0.97,11910.465,11917.505,"If we didn't get chance to hear from you, we knew you were there if we needed you and we appreciated you popping in.",203,,
1345,0.97,11917.505,11918.373,Thanks.,203,,
