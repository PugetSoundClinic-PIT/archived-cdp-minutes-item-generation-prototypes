I'm aware there was a delay in the Online set up for having folks register Online . S in order for us to make sure we give a few more minutes for people to be able to sign up in the full two hours, I have a Fe comments just to get us started here as folks may still be filling in the Online form . All amendments today need to be SEL balancing . We have put together a consent agenda package for Yo that includes groups B, and group C. group B, is the heart of the chair's balance be package and group C, also includes amendments that we possibly discussed in the past that we are seeing favorable an complementary to some of the existing items in the chair's balancing package.",97,,
108,0.97,880.579,886.252,"However that does not necessarily mean there won't be support for items a, and D, fro the chair.",98,,
109,0.97,886.252,897.096,"I do need to say though, that if you do not have a funding source and still want t make a change to group B, that does require funding, then our package will no longer be balanced.",99,,
110,0.97,897.096,900.399,And this will be a huge problem for central staff and for us.,100,,

112,0.97,914.38,925.824,"Today is the last day that we can make amendments to the balancing package . and thus, wh it was so important to make sur that amendments that were being considered were self balancing.",102,,
113,0.97,925.824,939.004,"If a council member is interested in pulling an item that requires an additional fun or funding source, this will no be taken lightly, because we have to have a balanced budget, and we need that to be balanced by the end of today.",103,,
114,0.97,939.004,963.595,"So there is no time to go back to the drawing board for large ticket items that don't have funding associated . We do not have the ability to find money that does not exist . Toda is to consider amendments that are self balancing and as noted in the process, we need to information last week so that W can work with central staff to ensure that self balancing amendments are part of our deliberations today.",104,,
115,0.97,963.595,981.146,"So I will not be shy about noting when or if an action attempts to move forward an amendment that does not have a funding source . and if you have not found a way to balance for an increase that you want, then we need to make sure that we AR addressing that in the moment that it is being pulled up.",105,,
116,0.97,981.146,1022.287,"To repeat, you do not have to pull an item just to speak against it . I don't know if I have already said that . So apologies . Let me say this again . When we get to the Actua agenda, and we start going through the consent package items in groups band C, colleagues, if there is pieces that you do not like, you don't have to pull an item out just t speak against it . If there is pieces that you really like Tha you sponsored, that you want to highlight for members of the community and the media, you ca speak to it without having to pull it out . pulling out an amendment means that we will have an opportunity for a vote.",106,,
117,0.97,1022.287,1033.465,"But please note that it is not an opportunity for just pulling out an amendment to speak to it you with ill have a chance to speak to any items in groups B, and C, before we take a final vet.",106,,
118,0.97,1033.465,1051.15,"Please consider when we get to groups band C, that pulling things out merely to speak in favor or opposed, especially if you do not have a way to make itself balancing is highly discouraged and not what today is for.",107,,

329,0.97,4938.333,4957.585,I also urge the city Counci to fund free abortion which wil only cost $9.5 million as part of the increase to the Amazon tax . The Democrats on the city council have a choice . You can vote yes on the proposed increase to the progressive Amazon tax or you can vote on a budge which reduces revenues.,258,,
330,0.97,4957.585,4986.081,You can tax big business during this period of inflation or cut essential services for working class women . The profits of Billionaires will help the well-being of the rest of Seattle . Amazon and Starbucks have made record breaking profits during this period of inflation while wages have not caught up with inflation . vote yes to the $140 million increas to the Amazon tax.,258,,

During the pan, Billionaires and Multi-Millionaires made a huge amount of money while working people suffered and now we are being faced with huge inflation and skyrocketing rents as other people have said . and like we desperately need the $140 million from the Amazon budget tax being expanded to cover these shortfalls and not make these cuts . In addition I also want to echo other people's point Recorrecting the million dollars in the shot Spotter technology . It is ineffective and wasteful and that money could be much.",260,,

We'll have a second to hear about that issue in a moment . next is group B which I consent package . This is a series of amendments that make up balancing package released Monday and where there were minor changes that with initial amendments included in the balancing package and those WER were included in group B. if there was existing amendment, I was swapped outs if similar to original proposed amendment included . If we receive new information about changes in revenue needs, some of the item were adjusted but the content O the balancing package as released Monday is largely reflected in group B. group C includes consent package of additional amendments . These AR series of amendments to the package that I find favorable O friendly to underlying budget and would signal adoption as part of the consent package to be added to the package . group are mostly related to policy ideas previously discussed in commit eye that I would have liked to have been include in the chair's balancing package but was not able to or the idea had not been presented yet . at this point we have it into a concert group, group C. group D single stand alone amendments for individual vote . I want to note that because an amendment is listed in group D this does not indicate the chair does not support it . I may be supporting ideas in this list of Emits in are stand alone items in group but the reason they are listed as stand alone amendments is because they are ideas or approaches I believe warranted additional discussion from each of the Council members for thei consideration to include each O these items . so as it relates t groups B and C, Council members you will hear from central STAF in a second about the process.",317,,

So we will return to the slides as needed just to remind people of the process if it comes up later . I wanted to reiterate a couple points that chair Mosqueda covered in opening remarks and just now as we were moving into agenda items . As we talked about previously state budget act requires Seattle ADOPTS balanced budget . The Mayor's proposed budget and initial balancing package met this requirement and that is wh it is important today that we end the day with all the amendments to proposed budgets and to the balancing package that we maintain that balance.",319,,

If you move to remove an item it will be taken up after the vote on the remaining items and will be considered in Alpha Numeric order . next slide . This is reiterating how you can remove CBA from a voting group and Whe to make that request . We'll return to this as needed during committee discussion . next . Thi describes in writing what I orally described in terms of th options . If you would like to remove item for individual vote you can do that when chair call upon or makes that request of her colleagues . At that time it is not a substantive discussion about item you were asking to B removed . It will be removed and taken up later . If you have a substitute option for the item, you would make motion to substitute whether he we get to of the items removed from the group . next slide . This is the key . When an item is removed fo individual consideration, after that item is moved and Seconded when we get to the items for individual consideration, if there is a substitute, you Woul like motion to substitute your new option for the option that was in the original group . FIRS is vote on the motion to substitute . If you vote yes, Yo are voting yes on the new option . I would say if you prefer the substitute version, you would vote yes on the Motio to substitute f you prefer original option posted in the group, you would vote no on the motion to substitute and will likely return to this slide later in the process . Finally after we get through today, which I am optimistic we will D efficiently and smoothly, we will return to Committee on the 28th . that will be for Committe to just take final action on budget adoption ordinance and other key budgets legislation that recommendations from the committee occur after the votes today . There may be some technical corrections that we bring before committee to be sure everything is tight before you take final action on the 29th . on the 29th all 25 to 30 Miss of budget legislation will be before the Council for final action including the bill that ADOPTS the budget overall and Capitol improvement program.",319,,

438,0.97,7734.693,7861.92,"Seeing no questions I will make a couple comments before group one . Central staff shared an E-mail with Council members last week and some of this was outlined in Tom's and the director's original memo on general fund balancing earlier in this process . The city's general fund has two key emergency reserves . One is the revenue stabilization fund . The target balance of that is 5% of General tax revenues and that fund is at 67 million, policy maximum . We also have emergency fund for general fund which was significantly depleted during Covid-19 pandemic . resolution 32024 was adopted in 2021 and updated emergency fund policy t allow for a five year period of the emergency fund between 2022 and 2026. Proas posed budget included contribution of $10 million in 2023 and 10 million in 2024. some of those were reduced in the balancing Packag which is allowable under Curren policy . However with further internal conversation for city budget office and central staff we have determined that Removin those contributions may be Lowe than is prudent for the city an recommends achieving at least a $5 million a year contribution to show a continued steadied investment in the rebuild of of that emergency fund over the next few years . As you move to group a, you will have options in front of you to increase contributions to the emergency Reserve and happy to field further questions as you consider those options.",320,,
439,0.97,7861.92,7878.57,Thank you very much . are there additional comments to central staff to open up our discussion for today? I have a question in the gallery from Councilmember Strauss.,321,,
440,0.97,7878.57,7898.423,"Thank you, chair . regarding this conversation about emergency reserves, I know both of you addressed this . can you tease out and pull out when did we know this information? What did we find out? What is impact if we had not made a change since last week?",322,,
441,0.97,7898.423,7964.189,"Sure E I would say there has been ongoing conversation between central staff, city budget members and Council Abou what is appropriate level to contribute to emergency reserves . We have considered things like how does this Impac the city's bond rating, have considered how does it impact revenue forecast that came out last week which showed a significant reduction in city revenues available for this budget . There have been a variety of conversations and pieces of emerging information that inform the point you are a today which is that our recommendation is achieving contribution of at least 5 million a year to the emergency Reserve in order to show the steady rebuilding of the fund over a five year period as defined in financial policy.",323,,

443,0.97,7964.856,8026.985,"I would add to that that I want to be clear that the initial package was consistent with current financial policies for city related to the emergency fund as director hand highlighted through additional conversations a with CBO and al of you and others within the city family and given the economic forecast and all of that, it is visible to maintain or to contributed what is described as what the future economy looks like and going into a recession and those things . I wanted to be clear that the original package along with this with the city's policies fund--on the agenda",325,,

445,0.97,8028.854,8057.549,"Thank you, chair . Maybe I will ask you if what I am sayin is correct . What I learned last week is due to a changing economic forecast, we needed to put more dollars into our emergency fund to maintain status that we have with bond rating of AAA . If we find not made that change, we would be putting at risk our AAA status.",327,,
446,0.97,8057.549,8070.195,And this has been changing because of the economic Forecas and many other variables . that' the information I received . is this con Sis tents with what Yo understand as a change from Las week.,327,,
447,0.97,8070.195,8142.2,"Councilmember Strauss I Woul describe it a little bit differently . The Mayor's proposed budgets proposed to contribute $10 million in 23 an 10 million in '24 to emergency Reerves . that is based on the plan discussed in last year's budget deliberations as well to pay back emergency fund based O the use of the fund during Earl Covid pained . initial package would have reduced that contribution to $1.5 million total . This revised package based on the information that reducing the compensation short term may have an impact on the city's ratings as well as concern about the availability of resources as we are continuing to get news about th economy . Yes, that is accurate but I would say it is advice best practiced . It's based on what city has been discussing I terms of contribution but it is a reduction.",328,,
448,0.97,8142.2,8323.381,"That so much deputy director I think it is fair to say that everybody from CBO office, central staff, my office, we AR trying to work with limited resources and recognizing it Wa well within and consistent with existing policies to suspend a Komo TV because we made a Polic choice to do that . and in the two to three days after releasing it in good faith and in partnership with CBO once learn willing may be concern we wanted to seek to close that an there is no interest in trying to debate whether or not the worst case scenario wouldn't play out if the suggestion is jointly that we would be best served by providing at least $5 million a year to the contribution, there is no questioning of the need there I think from Council or no interest in division of Approac in terms of how to get at least 5 million into that without executive either . Council President Juarez . You are on mute . Thank you . I have was chatting away and no one could hear me . I am glad Councilmembe Strauss asked that . We had this conversation Offline too Councilmember Mosqueda . Reducin in the short term or coming BAC after meeting with CBO, looking at what exposure would be in AA bond rating and Capitol project in the Queue and coming back to at least a $5 million Approximater year contribution so I am going to share what public often doesn't always Kno what we have to do . It's not anything shady . It's just we found out a lot of the economic forecasts after wards and had t Recalibrate thinking on what policies are around where we ca replenish the reserves but at the same time remaining true to policies and commitments we made . Councilmember Strauss correct me if I am wrong based on our conversation, that's Wha changed my thinking too right U until Wednesday on the contributions and what concerns were about reserves . I think what I was trying to do and, correct me if I am wrong, what he was trying to do as well is put into context what physicals thinking was and how it changed after we realized we needed to put money back into the reserve fund . I wanted to share that part of the conversations we were having with CBO and Centra staff and of course you Madam chair . Thank you.",329,,

This information is downstream impact from the revenue forecast .

460,0.97,8466.324,8726.184,"Thank you . There were a number of analysts involved so will give a high level description of what is Differen in the substitute and if there are questions about specific items included I will ask colleagues to answer those questions as presented the option in the original package would have retained parking enforcement unit in s DOT, keep base funding in s DOT for parking enforcement officers an would add additional funding to supplement the s DOT funding with some addressing overall issue as well as additional resources for parking enforcement officers . The substitute option Councilmember Strauss is presenting would accept to move the unit from s DOT to SPD . that's one of the sky differences between the two options . result of accepting that would be there are about 1 $16.6 million . Instead of providing that to s DOT for parking enforcement officers this would do the following . It would add $1 million in 23 and million in 24 to human services Department for recreational vehicle parking and storage associated with Noncongregate Sheeter . It would add $1 Millio in 2023 to increase funding for contract with the public defender Association and let everyone advance with dignity, lead, Colead programs . This is not addition to the $4 million over that is included in an amendment in group B. it would add $1 million in 2023 to the Seattle parks and recreation Department for city hall park activation . This is in addition to 1.3 million that is also included in a separate Amendmen in group B from the initial package . It would adds 100,000 Todd economic development to develop in coordination with Seattle information technology departments, a scope schedule and budget to implement permitting portal for economic activity permits specifically farmers market special events and film permits . It would adds 250,000 in 2023 to the human services Department for mobile advocacy services but flexible financial assistance for survivors of gender based violence, adds $1 million in 23 and 500,000 in 24 to Department of transportation's struck collapsing you can's structure and add in 2023 to the Seattle center for Memorial Stadium redevelopment project that Woul increase cash financing available to support to $1 million in 2023 adding to funding also included in a separate amendment in group B a well as funding to issue 20 million of debt to support Capitol project beginning in 24 in addition this would allow Council budget package to transfer $6.5 million in '23 an 6.5 million in 2024 to the emergency Fund . It would allow for a couple proposed reduction included in the initial package to not move forward to funding would be retained . that include for funding improvement media plan, funding for assistant CIT attorney position, funding that would support work in the Seattle police Department or would be transferred to Seattle police Department and would allow retaining funding for position in the civil service positions to expand strategy an policy work . that is the high level summary of that amendment",338,,

462,0.97,8729.053,8730.788,Councilmember Strauss you are recognized.,339,,
463,0.97,8730.788,8794.685,Thank you . before you is my amendment to transfer funding O parking enforcement officers from s DOT to SPD . This does no indicate my desire from parking enforcement officers final home to be within SPD . I support Councilmember Mosqueda in her work through the team to understand what Peos need and what Department is best for the to have the final home within I believe PEO civil enforcement needs to be outside SPD but a few issues have led me to bring this forward . understanding we need to Refill emergency funds as was described especially knowing that without doing so every Capitol project in our city could have some increased exposure . The knowledge as well ongoing knowledge while we have moved from SPD to s DOT the UNI has remained in place in SPD fo most Intents and purposes.,340,,
464,0.97,8794.685,8857.815,"Lastly if we do not make this budget alteration, if we did no use PEO as budget alteration, W would still need to fill emergency Fund and to do so we would be cutting important projects and programs . If I was to have brought my own Amendmen forward I would have only brought forward amendment that fills emergency Fund and funds programs and projects that fund homelessness responses for people living in their vehicles through shelter enhancements, Noncongregate shelter, outreach tiny homes . What is before you today and what I have presented is my top priorities, Increasin Fund, increasing homelessness services for people in their vehicle and priorities I have heard from each of you had during committee over the last week . I do not believe the Fina home should be SPD but do believe this is a prudent decision at this time.",340,,

467,0.97,8867.291,9088.712,"Thank you chair Mosqueda . I support the amendment in front of the Council from Councilmember Strauss and appreciate the accommodations within it that Councilmember Strauss has made for priorities on the Council bias . The decision we are faced with isn' one anybody on the Council is excited about given overall situation that the budget is facing from the revenue Forecas we received in the middle of Ou deliberations that has a significant impact both on the operating and Capitol ambitions of the city . I believe this is the appropriate place to Balanc the revenue shortfall given differential of providing same service between s DOT and SPD for where parking enforcement officer should temporarily be parked while we determine where their permanent position within city government will ultimately be . My understanding from talking to city dug office and Council central staff is it would cost approximately $8 million for the parking enforcement to do essentially the same function in s DOT and $740,000 for them to be housed in SPD in terms of additional overhead costs and given that differential and given that we don't anticipate people of Seattle really experiencing a significant difference in interactions with parking enforcement, whether Usad in SP or in s DOT, that seems to be the best place would be make up the difference without Impactin basic services to people of the city . So I do support this amendment path forward . I want to make a comment because later we will discuss process that budget chair has laid out to continue to assess the Permanen home for the parking Enforcemen officers . I do want to Reiterat and lift up my hope that they will eventually move either to the CSEC or to the new civilian Department, standing up with mandate of unarmed civil enforcement of issues in situations that don't require a badge and gun, that is in line with with a we received in 2020 wanting a broader role like Tha for the membership and in line with original proposals from Councilmember Herbold and other on what the future of the workforce could be and what it would look like . I want to Clos and say I appreciate additional 1 million in support for lead and Colead which is vital for downtown public safety recovery and strategies, really appreciate the work lead and Colead has been doing in collaboration with a number of Stakeholders and nonprofit business and labor world in the downtown community to make downtown a safer place and to lead with empathy and Compassio and getting people from the streets into housing and with wrap around supportive services I do appreciate that additional $1 million getting us closer to the goal of the level of investment we want to see in th program . We'll be voting for th amendment proposed by Councilmember Strauss.",343,,

469,0.97,9091.015,9144.869,"Thank you so much . I just want to add a little bit of history for the context around this amendment . in November 2020, the Council adopted a budget that moved parking enforcement to the Cscc . Mayor' office was directed to perform Idt and report to Council on progress made towards parking park enforcement to Cstc was required . in April 2021, the former President wrote to us to remind us why it was that Spiog proposed that parking enforcement be moved to the new community safety and communications center instead O s DOT . Peos are highly trained.",345,,

471,0.97,9209.366,9316.473,"Instead of Mayor's office and s DOT continued to make extensive plans to move parking enforcement to s DOT . We the Council were then extensively lobbied by Mayor's office and s DOT and thin last fall we reversed course and voted against PEO vision of Reimagine policing and moved them to s DOT . After we did again against the original proposal, prior administration Botched the transfer they fought so hard for . No surprise that Peos are now organized to get out of s DOT . They never wanted to go there . I am voting in favor of the budget action even though I do support PEO vision for civilian eyed role . at this point it seems the only thing t do other than 16 Million-Dollar cost, Mayor's Po pose al to Mov back to SPD . in the fact that they've surveyed workers and given that Mayor Harold in his budget speech acknowledged that SPD may not be the forever home for Peos I look forward to learning more about executive position for the workforce, Tas workforce who is so strong give for how they can best serve the community and thank Councilmember Strauss for the role he is playing saying this amendment forward to accomplish a number of other things we would not be able to do otherwise not the least of Whic is the emergency fund transfer.",345,,

I certainly am speaking ore all, support reducing of policing . I have spoken reportedly not the least since George Floyd movement broke out of the tremendous dangers of having a police Forc acting like occupation force which they did especially Durin the height of the protest and I have also spoken in my office, people's budget campaign every year is opened relentlessly about need for Nonpolicing solutions for problems of our society including public safety which as statistics show needs addressing economic and social inequality . However none of these substantive issues are honestly being discussed and my message is to where can people who are being activist, when they wanted to pretend they WER supporting demands of justice for George Floyd, they used Thi idea of Defunding the police by saying they were going to do that by transferring the line Toot Department of transportation . at the time in my comments, and they are consistent with what I have Sai since, I described this as accounting trick because it had zero substantive impact of the essential questions . It changed absolutely nothing about Parkin enforcement and only changed what Department's budget cuts the checks to parking enforcement officers or if writes collection to parking enforcement officers . This was convenient for Council Democrat who wanted thousands of working people protesting on the streets, really tens of thousands at the time, to believe they were being heard without making any substantive change because ultimately the Legionence of the establishment is to not just the police Department but really the Polic Department like any other we'll be right back much serving interest of ruling class, the wealthy . the same is happening in reverse . The Mayor would Lik the people to believe that he I taking crime seriously while at the same time refusing to do what is actually necessary to make our neighborhood safer which as I said statistically I to reduce inequality including by measures like increasing taxes on big businesses to pay for affordable housing, good Pa Union jobs, making sure there are no cuts relative to what services were needed compared t last year's budget . The Mayor proposes to reverse accounting Frommic to claim he is Refundin police Department that was Neve Defunded . It is a debate about nothing intentionally Crafted t distract from the serious issues . My office will not participate in the distraction and I will be abstaining on Thi and sequence two votes which AR linked to the agenda item . We need elected community over sight board that has full power over police Department Includin hiring, firing officers, subpoena powers, issuing Department policies and procedures . Other issue under discussion in relation is how t restore the emergency funds and how to make sure that the most essential and bare minimum services and needs for vulnerable people are funded later on in today's agenda, a budget amendment from my office and campaign will come up for a vote if the Council passes it will restore emergency Fund and at the same time restore all th cuts in proposed budgets by increasing big business tax rat of the Amazon tax . But I will speak to that more when it come for vote later in today's agenda . Thank you.",348,,

We definitely need increased funding for services that the Councilmember is suggesting . I can't in good conscious expand Footprint of SPD . I feel like this process was rather perform touch from the beginning . Performative from the beginning . As we heard in public comment this morning culture of the Peos at least in part still demonstrates Policin posture in the way that they interact with the public . So I don't agree with what some said about the idea that the public experienced Peos will be unchanged regardless of which Department they're in . for the reasons, I will be abstaining from this vote and subsequent votes related to moving Peos.",350,,

481,0.97,9723.68,9865.522,"Additional comments? seeing none, Councilmember Strauss I will make one more comment and turn it back to you as the sponsor . I thank Councilmember Strauss for his work to bring this amendment . I appreciate th spirit it was brought given Thi year and recent news from last week . This amendment will address emergency fund contribution needed and total contribution ends up being $13 million across . that's at least 3 million more than we needed t at a bare minimum provide and I think it's a good indication Ou city continues to remain on solid financial ground as we make tough decisions in the budget . I appreciate that the investments in the amendment AR being first targeted to the emergency Fund and given the late stage of the budget, I ALS understand there are very few places to pull revenue from . I appreciate that Councilmember Strauss has tried to do the right thing ensuring financial liability for our city and making this first . While I appreciate this, you can tell from the balancing package, maintaining PEO at the Seattle Department of transportation Wa a priority for me to be sure folks were not moved as we looked for Longterm home . This is not the policy direction I had articulated and envisioned in proposed budget and while I personally won't be able to support this amendment I am grateful for contribution to th emergency reserves, support for interdepartmental task force that will continue to work to find Longterm home and as Herbold and I believe Strauss a well noted the broader about future homes for various units but specifically parking enforcement unit within our CIT and which Department can best House this unit . I do also thin it warrants additional security about what happened to the individuals, both parking enforcement officers and supervisors during their time a Seattle Department of transportation and look forward to Partnering with the Mayor's office, Council members, community, labor as we figure out longer term discussions about permanent placement . than you so much Councilmember Strauss.",351,,
482,0.97,9865.522,9900.59,"Thank you . The last thing I will say is I have my district at the center and get to interact with Peos regularly . I think it is important for us to remember in the moment that we have a lot of work to do to understand what they need as forward facing employees on behalf of the city, what they need from Departmentfrom supervisors, within the unit an they are not just moved around from Department to Department.",352,,
483,0.97,9900.59,9953.743,"That is what this Interdepartment task force is Tasked with doing . understand what are their needs? What Department should they be house in? How does civil work compliment an interface with criminal work SPD does with noncriminal work and just civil service work s DOT does and how that comes to play . The commercial and vehicle enforcement unit of SPD is another that's similar to this that has to complement between Washington State patrol and s DOT . There is a lot to find out we have a lot of work to do Councilmember Mosqueda . I am excited for that . While I don't believe the Peos final home should be SPD, this is a Pruden move to make at this time . than you, chair.",352,,
