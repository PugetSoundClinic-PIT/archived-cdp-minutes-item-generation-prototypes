25,0.97,73.039,87.387,Over the last week we had a proclamation related to the open public meetings Reissued by Governor Inslee and the state Legislature that allows us to continue to have electronic meetings.,16,,
26,0.97,87.387,92.192,In fact is now mandated that we continue to have remote meetings.,16,,
27,0.97,92.192,109.042,So I'm going to go ahead and go through the steps of suspending our Council rules to allow us to electronically participate during Council briefing meetings in order to be consistent with that proclamation that was just recently extended by Governor Inslee.,16,,
28,0.97,109.042,109.843,To continue participating remotely.,16,,

35,0.97,148.348,148.815,President's report.,16,,

37,0.97,156.956,165.732,Council and regional committees and I'm going to call on Council members as established by this week's rotating roll call.,16,,

43,0.97,198.998,204.17,I don't have very many updates this morning.,17,,
44,0.97,204.17,212.445,There are no actions or no legislation from the select Committee on homelessness this afternoon.,17,,
45,0.97,212.445,249.482,I was proud to join with Council members Pedersen and Herbold in putting forward a $20 increase in the vehicle license fee under the Seattle transportation Benefitdistrict in order to make a enlarged commitment for much needed bridge maintenance as laid out in a recent auditor's report indicating the state and condition of Seattle's bridges and our historic Underinvestment in the maintenance of this critical infrastructure.,17,,
46,0.97,249.482,255.254,The city of Seattle is a city of hills and waterways stitched together by networks of bridges.,17,,
47,0.97,255.254,265.565,"District 7 is no exception to that and has its own share of bridges, including two that are going to need sustained maintenance in the future.",17,,
48,0.97,265.565,268.801,The Ballard bridge and the magnolia bridge.,17,,
49,0.97,268.801,307.707,I look forward to working with everyone here in this last week and a half of the budget process to see if we can continue to increase that commitment as outlined in the auditor report for bridge maintenance and would know that it's especially critical for our Multimodal bridges that are going to be essential for the future of bus transportation in the city to make sure all neighborhoods have access to bus trips of a frequency of 15 minutes or faster.,17,,
50,0.97,307.707,312.512,With that I don't have any additional updates.,17,,
51,0.97,312.512,321.154,Looking forward to discussing the form C's that my office submitted at the appropriate times this coming budget meeting later in the week.,17,,

57,0.97,336.336,339.505,Thank you very much.,19,,
58,0.97,339.505,340.073,"Good morning, everyone.",19,,
59,0.97,340.073,344.911,I want to acknowledge the new announcement that came from governor Inslee over the weekend.,19,,
60,0.97,344.911,353.353,"Colleagues, this is something that we talked about last week and the headlines across the country are talking about the need to stay home, to stay healthy.",19,,
61,0.97,353.353,359.926,Please do take that to heart as you cancel any holiday plans for the upcoming 2 to 4 weeks.,19,,
62,0.97,359.926,360.36,I know it's hard.,19,,
63,0.97,360.36,371.971,"I want our baby to be able to see their grandparents and, you know, these are the times we're living in in order to make sure there is another time for folks to be able to see their loved ones.",19,,
64,0.97,371.971,376.375,It's imperative that we all stay home so we can slow the transmission of this disease.,19,,
65,0.97,376.375,387.186,Governor Inslee yesterday posted an alert that said yesterday was the most dangerous day in Washington's 100 year history as it relates to public health.,19,,
66,0.97,387.186,394.66,And I appreciate the governor issuing the proclamation and the demand for us to take these numbers to heart.,19,,
67,0.97,394.66,412.645,Not only to wear our masks and socially distance as we've heard but to recognize that the places where transmission is happening is within our homes and then when we go to places like restaurants or out to eat and interact with the general community or risking spreading transmission to the general population.,19,,
68,0.97,412.645,414.614,So I know this is a hard time.,19,,
69,0.97,414.614,428.394,My sister has talked about how going to the gym is her only outlet for mental health right now and this is a really challenging time and I'm hoping that everybody recognizes that we're in the same boat and does everything that we can to maintain the public's health.,19,,
70,0.97,428.394,430.963,We have done that as a Council.,19,,
71,0.97,430.963,444.11,"We recognize that the complications of Covid and the economic downturn were going to have a dramatic impact not just on our health as individuals but the financial health for small businesses, especially restaurants.",19,,
72,0.97,444.11,447.079,Especially our small businesses and bars and restaurants.,19,,
73,0.97,447.079,447.513,Retail folks.,19,,
74,0.97,447.513,449.849,We know that this is extremely hard time.,19,,
75,0.97,449.849,457.89,We stepped up and we helped to ensure there was additional support through the jump start Covid relief plan earlier this summer.,19,,
76,0.97,457.89,461.394,We recognize that this was going to hit Renters the hardest.,19,,
77,0.97,461.394,467.466,"Renters most likely to be people of color, women, members of the Lgbtq community.",19,,
78,0.97,467.466,486.385,"Given that over half of our population is Renters in this city, wanting to not only ensure that there was rental assistance but there was Eviction prevention dollars and to help the small landlords across our city as well who we know in some cases are also reliant on those rental payments to make sure that their own mortgage is paid.",19,,
79,0.97,486.385,491.524,We did that through the jump start Covid relief package this summer.,19,,
80,0.97,491.524,509.008,We stepped up by providing assistance in food assistance and additional security so that folks would have less of a likelihood of going hungry and we know prior to Covid one out of every four Kiddos was food insecure in this area and we stepped up to provide food assistance.,19,,
81,0.97,509.008,513.312,As you'll remember that $86 million package was initially vetoed.,19,,
82,0.97,513.312,533.099,"We came back with a $58 million piece that we negotiated down because we wanted to make sure that something at least got massed and was not vetoed and we appreciate all of the calls that we've continued to receive for additional assistance for small businesses, for rental assistance, for folks who need food assistance and a lot of that is being addressed in this budget.",19,,
83,0.97,533.099,556.222,"I think because we have been able with your support and with the success of all of your thoughtful approach to this budget we've been able to secure almost around $40 million, about $38 million in our emergency reserve funds and we don't have a ton of indication that there's going to be swift action from a divided Congress at this point.",19,,
84,0.97,556.222,590.489,I'm just flagging for you all as this recession worsens and our public health numbers continue to skyrocket this compounded with the highest rates of unemployment that our city and state have seen in history we will probably need to continue to make sure there is additional emergency assistance available and that is why we have stepped up to provide about $40 million worth of reserves in case those Federal dollars don't come through and we'll continue to see worsening economic and health concerns.,19,,
85,0.97,590.489,592.291,U.s. Jo want to provide that context.,19,,
86,0.97,592.291,598.698,Your city has been working to make sure there is additional support for small businesses.,19,,
87,0.97,598.698,600.032,Those who are facing unemployment.,19,,
88,0.97,600.032,603.502,Facing potential Eviction and not able to pay their rent.,19,,
89,0.97,603.502,606.405,People concerned about putting food on their table.,19,,
90,0.97,606.405,623.356,We are going to continue to work to make sure we're stepping up if the divided Congress does not and we're look forward to the next administration at the Federal level to support the city.,19,,
91,0.97,623.356,627.56,Through Mayor Durkan's administration and we offer this support to our community.,19,,
92,0.97,627.56,628.794,But much more is needed.,19,,
93,0.97,628.794,636.068,"As we think about the upcoming budget, want to note there is two meetings this week for the budget committee.",19,,
94,0.97,636.068,638.471,The Wednesday and Thursday meetings start at 9:30 A.M.,19,,
95,0.97,638.471,646.145,Public comment is going to be accepted for at least the first hour of those meetings.,19,,
96,0.97,646.145,648.714,"That public comment period will, signups will start at 7:30 in the morning.",19,,
97,0.97,648.714,652.118,We will have the chance to go over the form C's.,19,,
98,0.97,652.118,654.754,The amendments that each Council member has submitted.,19,,
99,0.97,654.754,664.63,Last Tuesday we went over the balancing package that was developed by all of your input and lifting up community priorities.,19,,
100,0.97,664.63,674.507,We offered the draft Council's balancing package for your review and we'd really appreciate all the feedback we've received and all of the form C's you have submitted.,19,,
101,0.97,674.507,691.457,Colleagues we received over 50 form C's and in our effort to try to make sure that as many amendments were to be included as possible and a streamlined discussion we are looking forward to compiling a series of those amendments in a consent amendment package for your consideration on Wednesday.,19,,
102,0.97,691.457,697.229,"If there's any item you would wish to pull out for further discussion or consideration, you will always be welcome to do that.",19,,
103,0.97,697.229,706.305,This is our attempt to help to make sure a number of priorities that were listed are able to balance if they were able to go forward with your approval.,19,,
104,0.97,706.305,714.914,That is in addition to any additional amendments that folks would want to consider for the full Committee's consideration.,19,,
105,0.97,714.914,728.761,If they are not in the consent package we will do that in addition to the consent amendment package we are putting together for your consideration.,19,,

108,0.97,734.2,747.146,I'm looking forward to having a conversation in the next two days here about the amendments for your consideration as part of the consent amendment package and all of the other items that Council members wish to bring forward.,19,,
109,0.97,747.146,753.152,We also do not have any items from the Finance and housing Committee on today's full council agenda.,19,,
110,0.97,753.152,755.087,"And then Lastly, we have some news.",19,,

165,0.97,1065.664,1077.91,Special thanks to our budget chair for leadership and central staff on this complex and rapid process that is our budget process.,23,,
166,0.97,1077.91,1083.082,Just want to thank everybody who has been working so hard on this and the form C's.,23,,
167,0.97,1083.082,1087.986,It was hard to scramble and craft those.,23,,
168,0.97,1087.986,1096.028,It's even harder to Digest them and organize them and make sense and deal with the Rubix cube that is our budget.,23,,
169,0.97,1096.028,1099.565,Thanks Council member Mosqueda and central staff hopefully Istening in.,23,,
170,0.97,1099.565,1108.941,"After the 2021 budget is adopted our transportation and utilities committee will resume its meetings starting on Wednesday, December 2ND.",23,,
171,0.97,1108.941,1113.979,"We're planning for our final meeting of the year on Wednesday, December 16th.",23,,
172,0.97,1113.979,1115.948,We'll do December 2ND and 16.,23,,
173,0.97,1115.948,1121.487,The transportation utilities committee has no items on today's full council agenda.,23,,
174,0.97,1121.487,1135.901,"As Council member Lewis mentioned, Council members Herbold, Lewis and I have a Transportation-Related item on today's introduction and referral calendar for consideration by the budget committee this week.",23,,
175,0.97,1135.901,1137.703,That's 119951 regarding vehicle license fees.,23,,
176,0.97,1137.703,1148.013,In addition there will be a companion budget form C that would govern how to Prioritize the use of those funds.,23,,
177,0.97,1148.013,1153.952,And the budget form C would apply just to next year.,23,,
178,0.97,1153.952,1165.731,"Council bill 119951, you can find more information on my Website, my Blog, central staff is also available to answer questions from the Council members.",23,,
179,0.97,1165.731,1172.704,I'll quickly piece together the past discussions and urgent needs that culminated in this legislation.,23,,
180,0.97,1172.704,1181.246,We've be discussing for months the need for more bridge maintenance ever since the high bridge had to be closed due to cracking.,23,,
181,0.97,1181.246,1188.22,"And our city auditor started work on the citywide bridge assessment, which we all received several weeks ago.",23,,
182,0.97,1188.22,1208.941,"We have also been discussing for months the need to overturn initiative 976 because the vehicle license fees are vital to fund transportation projects and programs as authorized by state law, specifically Rcw 36.73.015.",23,,
183,0.97,1208.941,1214.513,"While Seattle residents currently pay an annual vehicle license fee of $80, it could drop to only $20 next year.",23,,
184,0.97,1214.513,1223.655,This legislation would have it essentially drop from $80 to 40 so that we can do all we can for transportation next year.,23,,
185,0.97,1223.655,1229.294,The state law permits the Council to enact that additional $20 Vlf.,23,,
186,0.97,1229.294,1240.672,"As we await a vaccine for Covid and transit Ridership to recover after plummeting this year during the pandemic, we have the urgent need also to increase the maintenance of our bridge infrastructure.",23,,
187,0.97,1240.672,1257.022,The budget form C that accompanies the Council bill will enable us to make a larger down payment toward this infrastructure priority and to do so in a way that serves multiple modes of transportation and supports our frequent transit network.,23,,
188,0.97,1257.022,1262.828,This would add to what the chair's balancing package was able to achieve.,23,,
189,0.97,1262.828,1274.973,"Despite the sharp increase in it transit Ridership including bus Ridership, I am optimistic about the future and we want to make sure our economy recovers and transit Ridership along with it.",23,,
190,0.97,1274.973,1293.125,"While this bill and the budget form C are focused on generating an additional 3.6 million more for bridge maintenance in 2021, there are many more dollars available for transit service hours for 2021 due to the ample reserves left over from the expiring STBD funding.",23,,
191,0.97,1293.125,1312.344,"As part of future transportation and utilities committee meetings we will look forward to working with Sdot, the transit advise illegitimacy board, oversight committee and other stake holders to discuss how to program those remaining STBD funds that are focused and authorized for transit.",23,,
192,0.97,1312.344,1326.825,"Speaking of bridges, this week I will venture inside the West Seattle bridge to see the most recent stabilization solutions installed by engineers and contractors.",23,,
193,0.97,1326.825,1332.497,"Tonight the Mayor is having a, attending another town hall for the West Seattle bridge as well.",23,,
194,0.97,1332.497,1338.904,Want to thank Sdot for visiting our Council briefing last week.,23,,
195,0.97,1338.904,1348.68,As well as options to repair or replace the high bridge so we can restore it in a timely and cost effective manner that Prioritizes safety.,23,,
196,0.97,1348.68,1356.421,Thank you.,23,,
197,0.97,1356.421,1357.022,Thank you so much.,24,,
198,0.97,1357.022,1364.262,Are there any comments or questions on that report?,24,,
199,0.97,1364.262,1364.463,Okay.,24,,
200,0.97,1364.463,1367.032,"Hearing none, thanks again for that report.",24,,
201,0.97,1367.032,1375.54,And next up is Council member Sawant followed by Council member Strauss.,24,,
202,0.97,1375.54,1375.974,Thank you.,25,,
203,0.97,1375.974,1376.408,Good morning.,25,,
204,0.97,1376.408,1380.212,There are no items from the Sustainability and Renters rights committee.,25,,
205,0.97,1380.212,1391.89,There's a regularly scheduled meeting of the committee for Tuesday the 24th which is one week from tomorrow which would be the last regularly scheduled meeting of the committee in 2020.,25,,
206,0.97,1391.89,1408.473,It is the intention of my office to hold a quick committee meeting on that date to hear and approve Renters Commission appointments and this is a date that committee meetings are often canceled because it's during Thanksgiving week.,25,,
207,0.97,1408.473,1411.143,And it's the day after the final budget vote.,25,,
208,0.97,1411.143,1423.054,If it committee members are not going to be available I would really appeal to you to let my office know so we can make alternate arrangements if that date does not work for committee members.,25,,
209,0.97,1423.054,1428.326,Just on the question of car tabs revenues I would just say one thing.,25,,
210,0.97,1428.326,1446.344,"Of course Needless to say I'm really happy that voters defeated Tim Eymon's yet another attempt to delude the city, County and state of much needed revenues as has been done by the right wing for decades.",25,,
211,0.97,1446.344,1468.834,I also hope the Council rather than city council rather than pushing for deeply progressive taxes from car tabs that will instead support the proposal from my office and the peoples budget movement to increase the Amazon tax so that we can fund all $93.6 million that have been reduced from the 2020 proposed budget.,25,,
212,0.97,1468.834,1470.368,Thank you.,25,,
213,0.97,1470.368,1471.102,Thank you.,26,,
214,0.97,1471.102,1476.641,Any comments or questions on that report?,26,,
215,0.97,1476.641,1483.648,Hearing none we'll hear from Council member Strauss and then Council member Herbold.,26,,
216,0.97,1483.648,1483.982,Good morning.,26,,
217,0.97,1483.982,1484.349,Thank you.,27,,
218,0.97,1484.349,1490.956,There are no items from the land use and neighborhoods Committee on today's introduction and referral calendar.,27,,
219,0.97,1490.956,1510.041,There's one item on today's agenda which is hearing on CB 191. the Council has adopted or extended this moratorium three times before to protect the two remaining mobile home parks in the city.,27,,
220,0.97,1510.041,1514.346,This legislation would again extend that moratorium for six months.,27,,
221,0.97,1514.346,1521.386,We required public hearing is occurring at full council because of the budget proceedings as this would typically occur in committee.,27,,
222,0.97,1521.386,1532.464,"The vote is scheduled for Monday, November 30th after the budget is complete due to timing of the expiration of this moratorium and ensuring that there is, that we don't have a lapse.",27,,
223,0.97,1532.464,1546.311,I am optimistic this will be the final time we have to adopt a temporary Expension tension as my office has been working for several months to develop a permanent regulation to be considered next year.,27,,
224,0.97,1546.311,1560.425,"Council member Juarez has been deeply engaged in this process and we all as a city will benefit from her perspective as a lawyer and her dedication to this legislation, and all district 5 residents.",27,,
225,0.97,1560.425,1563.228,I can't thank Council member Juarez enough.,27,,
226,0.97,1563.228,1572.704,This next meeting of the land use and neighborhoods committee will be on December 9th as the November 25th meeting will be canceled.,27,,
227,0.97,1572.704,1590.221,"Last week I was able to attend the King County Affordabe housing subcommittee which we were able to pass shared goals on, shared framework on new revenue on how we can build more housing throughout King County.",27,,
228,0.97,1590.221,1606.605,Here in district 6 I spent my resident meetings speaking with local business owners and spoke to several business owners in Ballard and other parts of district 6. on Thursday I joined the Ballard District Council's virtual meeting to discuss public safety and answered questions submitted by residents.,27,,
229,0.97,1606.605,1612.344,"If you'd like to view that discussion, it is still on the Ballard District Council's Youtube Website.",27,,
230,0.97,1612.344,1630.228,My staff continues to help district 6 residents find solutions to the issues they are experiencing and I want to thank all of the residents of district 6 who have taken the time to discuss with me and my staff the issues and having us help them get to the solutions they need.,27,,
231,0.97,1630.228,1637.902,Every week I host district meetings with district 6 residents by phone and this week's calls will take place on Tuesday from 2:00 P.M.,27,,
232,0.97,1637.902,1638.236,To 7:00 P.M.,27,,
233,0.97,1638.236,1645.744,"If you'd like to speak with me, please reach out to me via the web form on my Website.",27,,
234,0.97,1645.744,1647.579,"Thank you, that is my report.",27,,
235,0.97,1647.579,1652.417,"Thank you, council member Strauss for that report.",28,,
236,0.97,1652.417,1654.653,Any comments or questions on that report?,28,,
237,0.97,1654.653,1665.03,Hearing none we'll go ahead and go down the line and hear now from Council member Herbold and then I will conclude this portion of the agenda.,28,,
238,0.97,1665.03,1665.53,Good morning.,28,,
239,0.97,1665.53,1668.133,Good morning.,29,,
240,0.97,1668.133,1669.901,Good to see everybody today.,29,,
241,0.97,1669.901,1674.339,Thank you for the time to go through the items this week.,29,,
242,0.97,1674.339,1688.92,I have no items from the public safety and human services Committee on either the full council agenda nor on the information and referral calendar.,29,,
243,0.97,1688.92,1710.275,"But I do have, I am a cosponsor to Council member Pedersen's legislation that States the Council's intention to direct additional vehicle license proceeds for at least 2021 to fund maintenance activities on Seattle bridges that support high capacity transit.",29,,
244,0.97,1710.275,1711.309,Or multiple modes of travel.,29,,
245,0.97,1711.309,1760.325,"Just want to speak a little bit to my interest if it's not completely obvious we all know what has happened with the West Seattle bridge and we know that one of the issues that Sdot has raised as it relates to the question of a repair or a replacement of the bridge as one of the factors that is weighing into their thinking about those two choices is their recognition that a repair for the West Seattle bridge although it's only estimated to be about $47 million, the cost of the annual maintenance is $500,000.",29,,
246,0.97,1760.325,1768.967,That's about double the anticipated maintenance cost of a brand new bridge which would cost about $400 million.,29,,
247,0.97,1768.967,1784.749,So for me that's a bit of a challenge to really look at the issues associated with the cost in maintaining our existing structures.,29,,
248,0.97,1784.749,1799.164,I don't think that we can go out and buy new things because we are trying to avoid higher annual maintenance costs of the things that we currently own.,29,,
249,0.97,1799.164,1817.248,"So it's really for me, made me really take a look at our investment policies and asset management responsibilities and really ask ourselves how we want to address the serious recommendations of the city auditor.",29,,
250,0.97,1817.248,1826.124,I think we do Audits because we want the city auditor's expert advice.,29,,
251,0.97,1826.124,1828.426,In this case we've received it.,29,,
252,0.97,1828.426,1839.604,And I think we would be Remiss in not striving to implement the recommendations of the city auditor.,29,,
253,0.97,1839.604,1880.178,"Again, we are looking at insuring that the funding from the Vlf in this instance is very focused on the kinds of bridges that don't just move cars but that are part of a frequent transit network of buses that are using our bridges in a way that they would not be able to accept new funds for additional service if we are not doing more to maintain those bridges.",29,,
254,0.97,1880.178,1896.06,I really think as a big advocate for adding service to our buses or adding funds for service to our new buses that we have to look at the infrastructure that they rely on.,29,,
255,0.97,1896.06,1899.43,We can't just look at one side of the equation.,29,,
256,0.97,1899.43,1909.407,"As it relates to upcoming items for the public safety and human services Committee, I do not have a meeting this week, nor next week.",29,,
257,0.97,1909.407,1915.013,My first meeting in some time will be December 8th.,29,,
258,0.97,1915.013,1923.354,"Just as it relates to some of the, some of what we've talked about related to the governor's announcement and new restrictions.",29,,
259,0.97,1923.354,1931.095,I know we are all very aware of these new restrictions.,29,,
260,0.97,1931.095,1935.767,To contain Coronavirus and there are statewide restrictions.,29,,
261,0.97,1935.767,1941.506,"As it relates specifically to King County, the numbers have doubled in the last two weeks.",29,,
262,0.97,1941.506,1946.477,We have significantly more cases now than we did during either of the earlier waves.,29,,
263,0.97,1946.477,1960.124,The number of people in Seattle currently in hospital with Covid-19 has increased quickly over the last week and is the highest it's been since April 2020.,29,,
264,0.97,1960.124,1963.361,"Again, we have to change our behavior.",29,,
265,0.97,1963.361,1965.863,Keep ourselves and keep one another safe.,29,,
266,0.97,1965.863,1973.771,Indoor gatherings of people outside of the household are prohibited unless everyone involved meets strict quarantine and testing requirements.,29,,
267,0.97,1973.771,1976.641,I know that's very difficult.,29,,
268,0.97,1976.641,1977.275,Particularly over the holidays.,29,,
269,0.97,1977.275,1986.451,"But again, this is a way we can show our love and our care for those around us.",29,,
270,0.97,1986.451,1989.454,Only outdoor visits are allowed at long term care facilities.,29,,
271,0.97,1989.454,2006.204,"Again, it's very heart breaking to think of not being able to visit our elderly family members and friends, but, again, these are really important restrictions that are serving the public interest.",29,,
272,0.97,2006.204,2021.719,It's heart breaking and difficult to think we're returning to the time we were in over the spring but this is really something that Covid fatigue or not we really need to take seriously.,29,,
273,0.97,2021.719,2031.529,Bars and restaurants are closed for indoor service and outdoor service is limited to groups of 5. Takeout can continue.,29,,
274,0.97,2031.529,2040.405,"Again, I recognize how difficult this is for our small business owners and the workers in the service industry.",29,,
275,0.97,2040.405,2057.054,"Particularly at this time when it felt like we were, could see the light at the end of the double of being able to get back to business as usual and then of course the retail and grocery stores restriction of 25% capacity.",29,,
276,0.97,2057.054,2060.124,These restrictions begin tonight and last until December 14th.,29,,
277,0.97,2060.124,2064.228,The exception is the of course the restaurant and bar restrictions.,29,,
278,0.97,2064.228,2066.998,They begin I believe on Wednesday.,29,,
279,0.97,2066.998,2078.843,"They've been, the restrictions have been reported widely in the media and given that they sometimes change, I encourage folks to check your usual media outlets to learn more.",29,,
280,0.97,2078.843,2083.748,These all have real impacts on Thanksgiving plans.,29,,
281,0.97,2083.748,2089.454,I really encourage everybody who celebrates Thanksgiving to plan a small celebration with the people you live with.,29,,
282,0.97,2089.454,2102.8,"For those of you who live with people and for those of you on your own, I encourage you to reach out to family friends and try to organize a virtual celebration.",29,,
283,0.97,2102.8,2114.812,"We saw in the Seattle times today there was a letter signed by 500 King County nurses urging us all to take these steps to keep them, their patients and all of our neighbors safe.",29,,
284,0.97,2114.812,2118.082,"Again, wear a mask when you're in public.",29,,
285,0.97,2118.082,2118.549,Particularly indoors.,29,,
286,0.97,2118.549,2125.189,Stay six feet from others outside of your household.,29,,
287,0.97,2125.189,2126.023,"Avoid gathering, especially inside.",29,,
288,0.97,2126.023,2132.497,Reduce travel and get tested right away if you have Covid-19 symptoms or were in it close contact with somebody who has.,29,,
289,0.97,2132.497,2151.349,"My weekly Shoutout to the Seattle fire Department and the number of Covid tests administered at their four sites is now nearly 364,000 Covid-19 tests administered at four sights throughout the city.",29,,
290,0.97,2151.349,2152.049,Dating back to June 5th.,29,,
291,0.97,2152.049,2156.921,Quick update from the human services Department.,29,,
292,0.97,2156.921,2164.395,The human services Department is hosting two community forums for the new safe and thriving communities division this week.,29,,
293,0.97,2164.395,2187.251,"You may recall that we learned during the budget process when we had a presentation from Hsd that they are creating a new safe and thriving communities division that will house many of the, house the funds in order to support the investments associated with community safety.",29,,
294,0.97,2187.251,2201.732,This new division is intended to respond to community requests for the city to reduce funding for the police Department and reinvest in community building efforts using nearly $22 million in annual investments.,29,,
295,0.97,2201.732,2217.215,"The new safe and thriving communities division consolidates human services existing funding for the community safety, for community safety and prepares Hsd to administer new community safety funding.",29,,
296,0.97,2217.215,2231.829,"Through the community forums, participants will learn about options to direct the work of the new division and provide feedback on hiring process for new division director and a community structure that shares responsibility for decisions and outcomes.",29,,
297,0.97,2231.829,2240.004,Goal of the division is that Hsd will fund community so that all people living in Seattle are free from violence.,29,,
298,0.97,2240.004,2249.814,"For folks interested in participating in these forums, I think they had their first one last Friday.",29,,
299,0.97,2249.814,2255.119,You can contact Terri Croft.,29,,
300,0.97,2255.119,2260.124,Items coming up this week.,29,,

304,0.97,2288.586,2297.762,"Was very, very helpful for me to be able to visualize the work they've been doing during the stabilization period.",29,,
