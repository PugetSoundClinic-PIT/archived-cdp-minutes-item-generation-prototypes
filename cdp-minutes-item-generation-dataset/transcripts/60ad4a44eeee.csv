16,0.97,85.385,92.225,And that means developing assets in such a way that wealth stays in our communities.,0,,
17,0.97,92.225,97.797,It's about focusing on wealth and resources so we create resilient local economies.,0,,
18,0.97,97.797,105.705,"We want to ensure young and old, artists, care Givers, and working class families get to share in the city's prosperity too.",0,,
19,0.97,105.705,123.89,"So strategically what I think that means is that we have to be laser focused on stopping displacement, finding a Pathway for worst development for underemployed folks, including our young folks, and supporting money ownership of assets.",0,,
20,0.97,123.89,128.962,Several issues come up as I think about the discussions I'd like to have in this Committee.,0,,

25,0.97,164.297,175.208,These are the kinds of questions I hope to talk about in this committee Throughoh out the course of the year and move us toward the kind of structural changes that can really start to build community wealth.,0,,
26,0.97,175.208,186.052,"And I'm looking forward to hearing from community members, from our departments, and from central staff over the year as we dive deep into how we can achieve this goal.",0,,

55,0.97,299.766,308.875,"And I have to say as we gathered as staff to think about what we wanted to present, we really appreciated the frame of community wealth building.",12,,
56,0.97,308.875,310.877,We envision most of our work being toward that end.,12,,
57,0.97,310.877,315.281,I think we'll go through that with the staff who actually do that workday today.,12,,
58,0.97,315.281,320.553,"And also, I think we're really excited to have a lot of our partner departments here in the room.",12,,
59,0.97,320.553,325.358,We have shared projects or shared staff with every other group on this Committee.,12,,
60,0.97,325.358,331.798,And I think we share our values around diversifying who benefits from our economy and preventing displacement.,12,,
61,0.97,331.798,336.002,I think those are shared priorities across all of our agencies.,12,,
62,0.97,336.002,337.804,Shout out to my colleagues in the room.,12,,
63,0.97,337.804,349.015,"I'll give a little bit of background about the office and then Erika and I will tag team and introduction to the work plan, and then we'll go through area by area what we're doing.",12,,
64,0.97,349.015,351.284,We'll stay within our allocated time.,12,,
65,0.97,351.284,357.39,Here's a photograph from the Mayor's arts awards circa 2018.,12,,
66,0.97,357.39,365.465,A bunch of lovely people working hard for you to foster arts and culture and view that as a way to accomplish large civic priorities.,12,,
67,0.97,365.465,370.97,We were chartered as a department in 1971.,12,,
68,0.97,370.97,383.049,"On the precipice of the largest lay off in Boeing's history when they went from 100,000 employees to 40,00 . Why would you Commission an arts Commission?",12,,
69,0.97,383.049,384.384,We have to give people hope.,12,,
70,0.97,384.384,388.955,I think that's something we still hold as a North Star.,12,,
71,0.97,388.955,401.934,"We think that creativity, art, Self-Expression, and community organizing is a powerful way to pursue solutions to the challenges that face us in a myriad of areas whether it's young people, Affordability, or living wages.",12,,
72,0.97,401.934,404.837,Do you want to go to the next slide?,12,,
73,0.97,404.837,412.545,"We do that work today, I'll say before we talk about our statement through a variety of programs.",12,,
74,0.97,412.545,416.015,"We focus on cultural investments, through a variety of strategies.",12,,
75,0.97,416.015,418.751,We focus on investing in our young people.,12,,
76,0.97,418.751,422.522,We have an entire program around space Affordability.,12,,
77,0.97,422.522,429.162,We are in partnership with economic development and growing an inclusive economy for our Ren John.,12,,
78,0.97,429.162,437.27,And we're focused as a Department on racial equity and social justice as a through line and a stand alone program if our Department.,12,,
79,0.97,437.27,443.409,"As Randy mentioned, we have a pretty big commitment to racial equity and social justice.",13,,
80,0.97,443.409,465.398,"When I first started at the office in 2015, we had reached a tipping point I would say where it was not just a handful of people passionate about the work but it was really the entire office looking at how the initiative really was part of their everyday work.",13,,
81,0.97,465.398,477.043,"In that, Diana and Cathy Shay worked with our intern Peyton, and she interviewed everyone about their work and what was important to them.",13,,
82,0.97,477.043,479.111,What did racial equity mean to them?,13,,
83,0.97,479.111,482.515,"From those interviews, we have our commitment to racial equity.",13,,
84,0.97,482.515,490.957,It was a beautiful thing that Peyton put together.,13,,
85,0.97,490.957,495.595,I as a communication person said it has to be not just for our office and not just our staff.,13,,
86,0.97,495.595,501.667,We went in 2016 and published it on the American for the arts and also in Grantmakers in the arts.,13,,
87,0.97,501.667,510.142,"That actually, I would say, spurred a national, regional, and local conversation that hadn't been the way it had in the past.",13,,
88,0.97,510.142,520.786,"Everyone talked about racial equity and social justice as something nice to have, but no one really knew what it meant and no one knew how to judge whether or not you were doing a good job.",13,,
89,0.97,520.786,524.357,"With this statement we put out, we were putting ourselves on that stage.",13,,
90,0.97,524.357,527.727,We were putting ourselves out there saying this is so important to us.,13,,
91,0.97,527.727,529.395,We are making a committee.,13,,
92,0.97,529.395,533.165,"And that's not just words, but it's also throughout our entire program.",13,,
93,0.97,533.165,534.8,So what does that look like?,13,,
94,0.97,534.8,540.606,"And for us, I think throughout this presentation, you'll see it is Deep-Seeded in everything we do.",13,,
95,0.97,540.606,547.38,"But we're also at that point where a lot of other people are, which is what are the Metrics?",13,,
96,0.97,547.38,547.88,What are the measures?,13,,
97,0.97,547.88,552.218,So those are some of the pieces we're working really hard on right now.,13,,
98,0.97,552.218,570.703,"And I'll just add to the for the racial equity, this was sort of Co-Signed and supported by the Seattle arts Commission that's been with our office for almost 50 years since we were chartered in 71.",14,,
99,0.97,570.703,573.806,The Seattle music Commission also supports us.,14,,
100,0.97,573.806,581.08,So those two citizen advisory groups who are volunteers of the community are really important and in Vetting this work throughout community.,14,,
101,0.97,581.08,582.381,So what are we doing?,14,,
102,0.97,582.381,582.581,2020?,14,,
103,0.97,582.581,587.653,"For some of you, this is probably the first time you'll walk through the work we do.",14,,
104,0.97,587.653,590.423,We want to do this through the lens of community wealth building.,14,,
105,0.97,590.423,594.86,"At a high level, you're going to hear about our cultural investments.",14,,
106,0.97,594.86,599.298,That is the multiple grant funding programs we run that invest directly in community.,14,,
107,0.97,599.298,612.478,That is the 1% for art program in 1973 we started the public art program in the country and have increasingly tried to bring an equity focus and community centered investment strategy.,14,,
108,0.97,612.478,627.66,"And cultural facilities, we are proud to be the stewards of two of our cultural Venues where we Prioritize and center the works of artists of color.",14,,
109,0.97,627.66,631.263,We have a Long-Standing commitment to young people.,14,,
110,0.97,631.263,633.199,Youth arts are the bottom.,14,,
111,0.97,633.199,639.538,"That includes arts creation and career connected learning, which you'll hear about today.",14,,
112,0.97,639.538,646.412,One way we invest in opportunity is investing in our young people.,14,,
113,0.97,646.412,650.082,Another area of our focus is around cultural space Affordability.,14,,
114,0.97,650.082,656.856,We are the only local arts agency that has a Affordability program.,14,,
115,0.97,656.856,663.229,You'll hear about the cap report that is aimed to create long-term Affordability in the city.,14,,
116,0.97,663.229,667.533,Our partnership with Oed and Ofm are on the industry's list.,14,,
117,0.97,667.533,673.639,How do we grow our creative Industries while reducing disparities in our creative economy?,14,,
118,0.97,673.639,680.946,It is also captured in this handy Dandy report that will be out in a week.,14,,
119,0.97,680.946,684.75,The Through-Line of everything we do is around social equity and racial justice.,14,,
120,0.97,684.75,693.926,"We're trying to bring it to life, and we'll talk a little bit about that work that Diana and others in the office are leading, and then we'll have questions.",14,,
121,0.97,693.926,696.128,There's our road map for the next 15 minutes.,14,,
122,0.97,696.128,696.595,All right.,15,,
123,0.97,696.595,702.234,So I'll get started talking about how we're building community wealth through our cultural investments.,15,,
124,0.97,702.234,713.145,"So as Randy said, we do that through our Grant-Making programs, through our public art program, and we also have two facilities.",15,,
125,0.97,713.145,715.247,The Langston Hughes and at King street.,15,,
126,0.97,715.247,723.756,"With our programs, we have been investing in the community for nearly 50 Yearsful we'll be celebrating our 50th anniversary next year.",15,,
127,0.97,723.756,734.066,"We've invested over $50 million into individual artists, cultural groups, and community groups that are doing creative work out in the community that's available for the public.",15,,
128,0.97,734.066,741.24,"You may know this, but the way we select who receives those grants is through a Peer-Panel review process.",15,,
129,0.97,741.24,745.244,It's not actually us as staff members who make the selections.,15,,
130,0.97,745.244,750.85,We facilitate and convene the community groups that make the recommendations.,15,,
131,0.97,750.85,764.296,"It's knowing that it's really important who's at the Decision- making table, we have focused on that through our racial equity lens and ensuring the people who are in the Decision- making role where is are the people who can most benefit from these funds.",15,,
132,0.97,764.296,770.102,"I'm proud that to say in 2019, 92% Oh of our panelists were people of color.",15,,
133,0.97,770.102,778.444,That's been a pretty dramatic shift over the last decade in who is actually at the Decision- making table.,15,,
134,0.97,778.444,791.924,"Specific to building community wealth, I thought that the cultural facilities fund would probably be very much of interest to this group.",15,,
135,0.97,791.924,793.359,And shout out to matt Richter.,15,,
136,0.97,793.359,799.231,It led to a dramatic change in how we go about the funding program.,15,,
137,0.97,799.231,811.477,Now this fund specifically creates greater access to those who have been Inequitably excluded from managing and renting property.,15,,
138,0.97,811.477,813.946,We focus on how we are distributing funds into the community.,15,,
139,0.97,813.946,827.059,"In the last couple of years, we've made major investments in Earl's cuts, chief Seattle Club, the James and Jane Washington cultural center among many others.",15,,
140,0.97,827.059,838.871,We also build community investment through our public art program by engaging with the folks who actually live in the communities and which new public art projects are being created through capital projects.,15,,
141,0.97,838.871,842.007,There are lots of projects going on at any one time.,15,,
142,0.97,842.007,849.281,I thought the suite of projects we have going on with Seattle public utilities in Ballard would be of particular interest.,15,,
143,0.97,849.281,853.018,"It's with their new, it's the ship Canal water quality project.",15,,
144,0.97,853.018,858.09,And so this is a massive infrastructure project that's happening in that area.,15,,
145,0.97,858.09,860.826,It's building a huge new water tank underground.,15,,
146,0.97,860.826,866.498,We have a whole art plan that's developing art available aboveground for people to experience.,15,,
147,0.97,866.498,868.734,There's temporary projects and permanent projects.,15,,
148,0.97,868.734,876.342,What's really interesting among many of these projects is that we have a whole suite of indigenous artists that have been engaged.,15,,
149,0.97,876.342,881.914,Ryan is doing real Hi interesting temporary projects right now that are these rain medallions.,15,,
150,0.97,881.914,885.251,So you can't see them on the sidewalk until it rains.,15,,
151,0.97,885.251,888.721,You've probably been able to see them quite a bit the last week.,15,,
152,0.97,888.721,895.094,"They show up when it rains, and they're these beautiful medal Daleions around the neighborhood.",15,,
153,0.97,895.094,901.066,"We're working with Jeffrey at the Ballard pump station, and David Franklin among others.",15,,
154,0.97,901.066,909.775,We have also had several major installations unveiled earlier at the Denney Substation in partnership with Seattle city light.,15,,
155,0.97,909.775,916.749,I think you all had a chance to select art work for your offices from our portable works collection.,15,,
156,0.97,916.749,923.022,"If you haven't, let us know, and we'll help get that over to you.",15,,
157,0.97,923.022,928.427,The Langston Hughes performing art Institute has been a centerpiece of the community for six decades.,15,,
158,0.97,928.427,938.17,We're really proud to help steward what's happening in that space right now and ensure that it continues to be a place where the black and African American community can gather.,15,,
159,0.97,938.17,940.572,That is a continuing work there.,15,,
160,0.97,940.572,943.375,Arts at King Street station is our newest space.,15,,
161,0.97,943.375,948.681,It is envisioned as a place where we can present work by and from people of color.,15,,
162,0.97,948.681,954.92,We have a community engagement group that selects all of the work that happens there.,15,,
163,0.97,954.92,955.854,It's a an application process.,15,,
164,0.97,955.854,958.891,Anybody can come in and say I want to present my work.,15,,
165,0.97,958.891,966.799,That's reviewed by the community group and we're able to facilitate that happening there.,15,,
166,0.97,966.799,970.97,So Tina will be talking about our youth investments.,16,,
167,0.97,970.97,972.137,Thank you.,17,,
168,0.97,972.137,978.711,So what better way to invest in our communities than in the youth in our communities?,17,,
169,0.97,978.711,992.858,"Um, our Couth arts team is Overseen by Kshama Sawant.",17,,
170,0.97,992.858,998.364,A a city wide collective impact initiative was started about 8 years ago.,17,,
171,0.97,998.364,1002.768,We're in the 7th year of implementation.,17,,
172,0.97,1002.768,1010.009,That is an initiative where we did a survey of what is going on in Seattle public schools as it relates to arts education.,17,,
173,0.97,1010.009,1026.658,"What we found out is that race, family income, and home language are the greatest predictors of whether or not your family or your student will be able to attain an arts education in our system.",17,,
174,0.97,1026.658,1027.393,And that's not right.,17,,
175,0.97,1027.393,1043.642,The initiative really works hand in hand with Seattle public schools and ensures every school Pathway by Pathway gets money to support arts partnerships and helps cools plan.,17,,
176,0.97,1043.642,1050.215,We look at data school to school and talk about where there's gaps and how we can fix those gaps.,17,,
177,0.97,1050.215,1055.32,We talk about where there's gaps in the system and how we can address those.,17,,
178,0.97,1055.32,1056.288,It's been wildly successful.,17,,
179,0.97,1056.288,1059.691,"By next year, we will be in every single Seattle public school.",17,,
180,0.97,1059.691,1062.494,We've been rolling out the neighborhoods with the most need first.,17,,
181,0.97,1062.494,1067.299,But every school will be a creative advantage school next year.,17,,
182,0.97,1067.299,1074.306,"We also focus on out of school time work, which is creative youth development work that my friend oversees.",17,,
183,0.97,1074.306,1087.953,"That's through our youth arts grant for out of school time for middle and high school students and for summer and other Thingsful we also address the work of my colleague Alex rose, which is about career connected learning.",17,,
184,0.97,1087.953,1092.157,Going from high school to college and creative careers in the arts.,17,,
185,0.97,1092.157,1093.459,And how important that is.,17,,
186,0.97,1093.459,1098.13,So we're trying to address every aspect of an age of young people in Seattle.,17,,
187,0.97,1098.13,1115.38,"This year for the first time, we got a massive grant from the foundation to attend to what students were asking for most, which is ways to celebrate and showcase what they're doing in the arts.",17,,
188,0.97,1115.38,1118.817,So we're spearheading three regional arts festivals.,17,,
189,0.97,1118.817,1121.22,The first is kicking off February 6th.,17,,
190,0.97,1121.22,1124.056,It will be at chief South high school.,17,,
191,0.97,1124.056,1139.505,"It's open to all schools, elementary, middle, and high schools in that Pathway will be performing and exhibiting their work with a huge free family meal with a new SPs chef who's making amazing Latin American food and East African food.",17,,
192,0.97,1139.505,1144.776,And we're hiring Interning from a set of high schoolers to run all the shows and we're paying them to do it.,17,,
193,0.97,1144.776,1146.578,That will be the first one.,17,,
194,0.97,1146.578,1151.45,The second one is at Rainier Beach high school and the third one is at Franklin.,17,,
195,0.97,1151.45,1164.229,"We're excited to talk to young people and work with young people, educate them about the gaps in their own education and ask critical questions about how they can ask for more and that's been working.",17,,
196,0.97,1164.229,1164.53,Thank you.,17,,
197,0.97,1164.53,1172.037,"I mentioned Matthew Richter, he's going to walk you through what we have planned for 2020 in the land of cultural space.",18,,
198,0.97,1172.037,1172.337,Thanks.,19,,
199,0.97,1172.337,1180.546,Randy mentioned we're the first city in the United States to invest in a body of work around displacement and invest in a staff position.,19,,
200,0.97,1180.546,1185.117,"As such, there's not a road map moving to work forward.",19,,
201,0.97,1185.117,1193.458,"We've sought to source these ideas from community, from the folks on the front lines facing these pressures.",19,,
202,0.97,1193.458,1196.895,Being the country's fastest growing large city has created.,19,,
203,0.97,1196.895,1212.678,"The folks who are feeling the disproportionate push of those pressures, we know they push on more vulnerable communities, on low-income communities, communities of color, and arts communities harder than the world at large.",19,,
204,0.97,1212.678,1221.453,"One of the first projects to roll out was launched at the end of 2014, beginning of 2015.",19,,
205,0.97,1221.453,1224.323,We have rolled out about a district per year.,19,,
206,0.97,1224.323,1227.893,There are four districts in the five years the program has existed.,19,,
207,0.97,1227.893,1231.396,That is the capital Hill arts district.,19,,
208,0.97,1231.396,1236.401,The historical central arts and cultural district.,19,,
209,0.97,1236.401,1244.81,"The uptown arts and cultural coalition, and in process now and they have been public about community engagement down in Georgetown.",19,,
210,0.97,1244.81,1246.878,We've been working with Georgetown for almost the last year.,19,,
211,0.97,1246.878,1250.015,It is about a year-long process to establish a district.,19,,
212,0.97,1250.015,1257.022,There have been about twice as many neighborhoods interested in the program as have been designated many the end.,19,,
213,0.97,1257.022,1258.857,It's not right for every neighborhood.,19,,
214,0.97,1258.857,1262.761,It's intentional that we slow walk the neighborhoods through the process.,19,,
215,0.97,1262.761,1267.899,We're also focused on very specific elements of cultural retention in the neighborhoods.,19,,
216,0.97,1267.899,1275.34,The capital Hill arts district is about organizational displacement in the pipeline neighborhood.,19,,
217,0.97,1275.34,1282.714,The historic central area district is about strengthening and Reconnecting black cultural heritage in the neighborhood.,19,,
218,0.97,1282.714,1289.721,The uptown is about supporting art work force housing.,19,,
219,0.97,1289.721,1294.96,Columbia Hellman is the connective tissue between those two neighborhoods using too Manies from the cap report and elsewhere.,19,,
220,0.97,1294.96,1300.298,And the Georgetown distribute are Ricket is focusing on where things get made.,19,,
221,0.97,1300.298,1305.771,It's the Generative arts district where the work happens.,19,,
222,0.97,1305.771,1311.41,The next phase of this work is interesting as well.,19,,
223,0.97,1311.41,1316.048,We've worked with Vivian Phillips to develop a new idea that we're calling the Chamber of culture.,19,,
224,0.97,1316.048,1327.993,"The Chamber of culture is what happens when city wide the leadership of all the districts sit at a table and establish a platform of priorities that impact culturally rich, culturally dense neighborhoods.",19,,
225,0.97,1327.993,1336.201,And what is shared between those and what can they advocate for and move forward when we aggregate that energy at one table?,19,,
226,0.97,1336.201,1339.771,That's a work if progress right now.,19,,
227,0.97,1339.771,1344.476,They'll be publishing work later this quarter.,19,,
228,0.97,1344.476,1352.517,"The cap report in 2017, cap is the 30 ideas for the creation, activation, and preservation for cultural space.",19,,
229,0.97,1352.517,1357.756,We Brougt together our 30 best ideas and to date have moved 14 of those ideas forward.,19,,
230,0.97,1357.756,1366.665,"Without going into the weeds too far on this, a couple of the favorites.",19,,
231,0.97,1366.665,1370.402,We changed how we designate art galleries in the land use code.,19,,
232,0.97,1370.402,1376.742,"They have been considered assembly spaces, which made it difficult if not impossible to put one into an older building.",19,,
233,0.97,1376.742,1381.012,We now designate them as Mercantile spaces.,19,,
234,0.97,1381.012,1386.718,It's more analogous to putting a shoe store into a retail space than a dance Club into a retail space.,19,,
235,0.97,1388.854,1395.36,We created an arts permanent Liasion we Co-Funded at Sdci.,19,,
236,0.97,1395.36,1406.938,That person stewards and Shepherds projects that are cultural space related through that difficult to manage process.,19,,
237,0.97,1406.938,1420.519,The heightened density bonuses we've created both as parts of Rezones and as parts of new incentive zoning program seek to Insent vise the creation of affordable cultural space in new projects.,19,,
238,0.97,1420.519,1425.957,Two of the larger projects to come out of that report are listed there as well.,19,,
239,0.97,1425.957,1432.597,The first is the build art space equitably Cohort.,19,,
240,0.97,1434.199,1439.104,It is a Cohort learning project where this is our second year running it.,19,,
241,0.97,1439.104,1446.578,It seeks to create more equitable participation in the development of Seattle.,19,,
242,0.97,1446.578,1453.385,"It's a Cohort that is made up of half folks from the cultural development community, from the arts and cultural world.",19,,
243,0.97,1453.385,1457.489,And half folks from the commercial real estate development community.,19,,
244,0.97,1457.489,1458.323,It's exclusively people of color.,19,,
245,0.97,1458.323,1472.337,"This is the second time we've run the program, and it's monthly sessions that explore ideas around building capital stacks for projects and story telling around projects.",19,,
246,0.97,1472.337,1482.914,And design and engineering and site acquisition and creating those connections between the cultural world and the real estate development would.,19,,
247,0.97,1482.914,1485.55,It culminates in square feet Seattle we run annually.,19,,
248,0.97,1485.55,1489.521,That will be coming up in November of 2020.,19,,
249,0.97,1489.521,1495.36,That was idea number two with certified people in the cap report.,19,,
250,0.97,1495.36,1503.101,"Idea number 23, I believe, was create a Mission-Driven independent cultural real estate development entity.",19,,
251,0.97,1503.101,1512.143,That idea was so rich and ran so deep we commissioned a whole other report about it called the structural for stability.,19,,
252,0.97,1512.143,1514.946,It recommended that very report.,19,,
253,0.97,1514.946,1516.815,That I've thumbed through repeatedly.,20,,
254,0.97,1516.815,1520.552,You found all the Typos.,21,,
255,0.97,1520.552,1528.593,"The organization that it recommends we're calling the cultural space agency, which is an intentional name.",21,,
256,0.97,1528.593,1530.962,Who's not a NASA Nerd?,21,,
257,0.97,1530.962,1542.707,"But also, the organization seeks to transfer power to community in a way that creates agency over their future in real estate.",21,,
258,0.97,1542.707,1551.116,Agency over their control of and their presence in the current development wave.,21,,
259,0.97,1551.116,1569.301,"We talk a lot about equitable equity in this work, about creating ownership stakes in a way that in real property in a way that centers the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged communities.",21,,
260,0.97,1569.301,1584.683,"The creation of the space agency is now a major priority cultural space and involves interdepartmental work with the equitable development initiative, the office of economic development, the housing office, and other departments.",21,,
261,0.97,1584.683,1589.321,"It gets its own presentation at some point, and I won't go too deep here.",21,,
262,0.97,1589.321,1592.857,There's incremental progress being made on that idea each week.,21,,
263,0.97,1592.857,1600.098,This project you see on the screen now is a new project called tiny cultural spaces.,21,,
264,0.97,1600.098,1607.706,There's a type of property called Snippits.,21,,
265,0.97,1607.706,1613.078,They are typically Unbuildabley Smalled and weirdly shaped pieces of property.,21,,
266,0.97,1613.078,1619.317,We have funded Sawhorse revolution.,21,,
267,0.97,1619.317,1623.388,"Through a competitive process, Estelita's library, we are building them this tiny structure.",21,,
268,0.97,1623.388,1625.256,This is about 350 square feet.,21,,
269,0.97,1625.256,1632.797,It is going to sit on a Snipit of property FAS has dedicated to the purpose.,21,,
270,0.97,1632.797,1635.033,We are leasing it to them for $1 a year.,21,,
271,0.97,1635.033,1637.635,We are granting them the structure.,21,,
272,0.97,1637.635,1638.37,They will own the structure.,21,,
273,0.97,1638.37,1643.541,They will have site control of the property for five years.,21,,
274,0.97,1643.541,1651.416,"In the third year, should the project be going well, we'll explore the seeding of that property to the organization itself.",21,,
275,0.97,1651.416,1656.955,"When we talk about wealth building in community, this is a significant asset.",21,,
276,0.97,1656.955,1659.624,It's a drag on City resources.,21,,
277,0.97,1659.624,1660.392,We Mow it.,21,,
278,0.97,1660.392,1666.398,We pull the garbage off it as people leave it there.,21,,
279,0.97,1666.398,1668.333,"As I say, it's Unbuildable.",21,,
280,0.97,1668.333,1675.273,"To a small non-profit organization, it is a trajectory changing impact and asset.",21,,
281,0.97,1675.273,1675.54,Right.,22,,
282,0.97,1675.54,1675.94,Thank you.,22,,
283,0.97,1675.94,1684.315,Much of our last year was spent in deep partnership and community listening around the creative economy and the needs of our creative industries.,23,,
284,0.97,1684.315,1692.39,Alex rose has been shared staff with Ofm for a number of years and continues to lead our work.,23,,
285,0.97,1692.39,1697.996,"I hate to be that person, but we're running a little bit behind, so ...",24,,
286,0.97,1697.996,1698.396,All right.,25,,
287,0.97,1698.396,1698.863,Proceed.,26,,
288,0.97,1698.863,1706.971,Just note to say I'm very excited to be part of this collaborative work around the creative economy.,27,,
289,0.97,1706.971,1714.045,"Randy mentioned the report that will be published next week, which will have a lot of the details that I could go into.",27,,
290,0.97,1714.045,1725.09,But I do want to say we have Prioritized centering the community voice in helping us to establish our work plan and establish our road map.,27,,
291,0.97,1725.09,1728.293,"And particularly, centering communities of color in our outreach.",27,,
292,0.97,1728.293,1743.408,"We spoke with nearly a thousand people through focus groups, interviews, surveys, and mixer events, networking events last year to really surface some of the common themes around how the city can better support an equitable, creative economy.",27,,
293,0.97,1743.408,1750.281,Some of the things that I want to touch on related to building community wealth have to do with building social capital.,27,,
294,0.97,1750.281,1755.253,I don't want to forget about the other kinds of capital Besides dollars.,27,,
295,0.97,1755.253,1762.894,So social capital is really important to us as it relates to young people and their work force development.,27,,
296,0.97,1762.894,1769.2,"So Mentorship and things like that, as well as getting folks within the creative economy Networked with each other.",27,,
297,0.97,1769.2,1777.709,"So folks who are looking for work, finding work by meeting other people outside of Maybe the circles that they run with already.",27,,
298,0.97,1777.709,1782.547,We also are committed to Aligning and maximizing our resources.,27,,
299,0.97,1782.547,1790.088,Randy mentioned the Seattle arts Commission and the Seattle music Commission as two advisory bodies we work with.,27,,
300,0.97,1790.088,1790.822,"Again, social capital.",27,,
301,0.97,1790.822,1800.632,"We want to leverage the knowledge they have, intellectual capital, as a way to advance this work and continue the collaboration.",27,,
302,0.97,1800.632,1806.371,"And finally, Diana will talk a little bit about our racial equity work in building community wealth.",28,,
303,0.97,1806.371,1806.704,Thank you.,29,,
304,0.97,1806.704,1815.446,"So I'm going to talk about a specific project that's part of our creative strategies initiative, which is a partnership between arts and office for civil rights.",29,,
305,0.97,1815.446,1821.486,That's now many years going in this particular Iteration is about 3 years old.,29,,
306,0.97,1821.486,1828.593,It's called the shape of trust and brings in Sdhr as an additional partner on the project.,29,,
307,0.97,1828.593,1851.382,It looks at how we can build an institutional culture at the city that's rooted in relationships and has an awareness of how to navigate power Dynamics based on oppression and hierarchy and how that internal culture and the practices related to it affect our relationship with community and the kind of decision making we do when it comes to building policies and programs and engaging community.,29,,
308,0.97,1851.382,1853.685,I'm speeding up a little bit for the sake of time.,29,,
309,0.97,1853.685,1866.898,"But I think that, you know, what we learn from this project related to community wealth building and building resilient local economies is how we do our work together is what we do with community.",29,,
310,0.97,1866.898,1871.102,It gets modeled out in how we relate to community.,29,,
311,0.97,1871.102,1877.041,Building a culture rooted in relationship and trust internally is the way we behave and the way we perceive community.,29,,
312,0.97,1877.041,1877.942,So we get to start here.,29,,
313,0.97,1877.942,1886.618,This work comes out of many years of organizing for work force equity and is in deep partnership with the team.,29,,
314,0.97,1886.618,1902.133,"And by organizing by people of color, particularly women of color and Trans-Gender folks, folks experiencing Heterosexism and Ableism as well who have organized for changes to our culture and practices.",29,,
315,0.97,1902.133,1914.812,"Phase one of the project was working to develop and perform three times last June, a performance based on real stories from our work force that told the stories of oppression and resilience.",29,,
316,0.97,1914.812,1933.164,"We have a Video of that and we're using it as one part of an Immersive Cohort that will launch in March and run through June for supervisors, managers, and people who advise on hr matters so we can shift culture in the city.",29,,
317,0.97,1933.164,1946.511,We're working with several national partners on an assessment and we'll be putting out a report on that and publishing the Video along with a curriculum guide so other institutions like us can have access to those same resources.,29,,
318,0.97,1946.511,1946.844,Thanks.,29,,
319,0.97,1946.844,1947.378,That sounds amazing.,30,,
320,0.97,1947.378,1954.886,I'm definitely interested in hearing more about that as you learn more.,30,,
321,0.97,1954.886,1970.168,"I think with what 11-13,000 city employees, it's important we make sure our work force understands how important a racial justice lens is so they can go out into the community and do that work on our behalf in a just way.",30,,
322,0.97,1970.168,1971.602,Thank you for sharing that.,30,,
323,0.97,1971.602,1972.737,That's what we prepared.,31,,
324,0.97,1972.737,1975.64,I know we ran a little long.,31,,
325,0.97,1975.64,1978.576,We're figuring out the contours of the new Committee.,31,,
326,0.97,1978.576,1982.847,"If you have questions, that's fine.",31,,
327,0.97,1982.847,1983.815,If you'd rather ...,31,,
328,0.97,1983.815,1985.55,"Thank you, Madame chair.",32,,
329,0.97,1985.55,1987.585,"Director Engstrom, thank you for coming down here.",32,,
330,0.97,1987.585,1990.655,I don't have a question.,32,,
331,0.97,1990.655,1994.425,I just want to state broadly the great appreciation I have for your office.,32,,
332,0.97,1994.425,2008.606,"I had the great privilege of attending first Thursday this month on Thursday, January 9th to see the last night of that gallery that was in place, which was a very powerful experience.",32,,
333,0.97,2008.606,2013.544,We had a great conversation during that time as well.,32,,
334,0.97,2013.544,2014.178,And I really appreciate it.,32,,
335,0.97,2014.178,2028.426,"I'm going to try to make it to first Thursday and for my fellow members on the committee, if you haven't had an opportunity to go down to that new space at King Street station and experience a first Thursday gallery there, it was a great experience.",32,,
336,0.97,2028.426,2031.496,It was really good to go down there.,32,,
337,0.97,2031.496,2039.103,"Had the privilege in marching with my friend who's the youth arts manager in our Department, a good friend of mine.",32,,
338,0.97,2039.103,2052.417,And I just wanted to say that I really appreciate the work you do and really look forward to working with you on this Committee and thank you so much for the presentation.,32,,
339,0.97,2052.417,2053.351,Anyone else?,33,,
340,0.97,2053.351,2056.921,"Well, thank you all so much.",33,,
341,0.97,2056.921,2059.791,And we look forward to having more conversation with you.,33,,
342,0.97,2059.791,2065.196,I'll be back whenever you're ready to bring us all back up.,34,,
343,0.97,2065.196,2067.198,Very good.,35,,
344,0.97,2067.198,2069.901,I think there's other Presenters.,36,,
345,0.97,2069.901,2070.268,Thank you.,37,,
346,0.97,2070.268,2072.804,We will move on to the second item.,38,,
347,0.97,2072.804,2077.909,Will you read the next item into the record?,38,,
348,0.97,2077.909,2088.186,"Development initiative, Edi, overview and discussion of the 2020 work plan.",39,,
349,0.97,2088.186,2093.825,Briefing and discussion.,39,,
350,0.97,2093.825,2094.992,Who do we have?,40,,
351,0.97,2094.992,2104.936,Uba will be back in a minute.,41,,
352,0.97,2104.936,2108.439,Ubax will be back in a minute?,42,,
353,0.97,2108.439,2109.04,Are you all ready?,42,,
354,0.97,2109.04,2113.778,Do you need to wait for Ubax?,42,,
355,0.97,2113.778,2116.214,"A minute, she'll be back in just a second.",43,,
356,0.97,2116.214,2117.415,Unless you want to start.,43,,
357,0.97,2117.415,2123.254,We can start.,44,,
358,0.97,2123.254,2125.289,Go ahead.,45,,
359,0.97,2125.289,2125.923,"Introduce yourselves, please.",45,,
360,0.97,2125.923,2133.531,"Samuel Assefa, director of community development.",46,,
361,0.97,2133.531,2133.831,Michael.,47,,
362,0.97,2133.831,2140.471,"Is the green light on, Michael?",48,,
363,0.97,2140.471,2141.372,Yes.,49,,
364,0.97,2141.372,2142.607,Are you sure?,50,,
365,0.97,2142.607,2142.874,Yes.,51,,
366,0.97,2142.874,2155.086,You might need to get a little closer to the Mic.,52,,
367,0.97,2155.086,2156.32,Unnaturally close.,53,,
368,0.97,2156.32,2162.96,And we are also joined by?,54,,
369,0.97,2162.96,2165.096,Ubax Gardheere.,55,,
370,0.97,2165.096,2165.396,Okay.,56,,
371,0.97,2165.396,2165.663,Great.,57,,
372,0.97,2165.663,2171.135,"Councilmembers, thank you for having us here for this presentation and a very important conversation.",57,,
373,0.97,2171.135,2177.108,"And for the new Councilmembers, welcome.",57,,
374,0.97,2177.108,2180.211,"Again, I'm Samuel Assefa, director of planning and community development.",57,,
375,0.97,2180.211,2188.452,We want to walk you through quickly initially about what Opcd is for the benefit of the new Councilmembers.,57,,
376,0.97,2188.452,2199.597,"I'll walk you through the structure and then focus on our key work priorities for 2020, especially around the equitable development initiative.",57,,
377,0.97,2199.597,2206.404,And then the link between that and community wealth buildings which is the topic of today's discussion.,57,,
378,0.97,2206.404,2208.539,I'm sorry to interrupt from the beginning.,58,,
379,0.97,2208.539,2213.511,If I could ask you to breeze through the organizational chart and save us a little time.,58,,
380,0.97,2213.511,2217.582,I'll actually jump to the next one.,59,,
381,0.97,2217.582,2218.149,Opcd is structured.,59,,
382,0.97,2218.149,2224.488,It's a new Department about four years Currenty.,59,,
383,0.97,2224.488,2228.259,So it's structured around administration.,59,,
384,0.97,2228.259,2230.161,"As you see, the organizational chart has five divisions.",59,,
385,0.97,2230.161,2238.569,"Out of the five, the first two you see on the left are sort of the key functions of the Department.",59,,
386,0.97,2238.569,2250.081,"Primarily around long-range planning, community planning, urban design, zoning, land use policies, which we'll talk about the importance of that, around community wealth building.",59,,
387,0.97,2250.081,2261.492,"And a new division that was created as part of the equitable development initiative is an equitable development division, which the team is led by Ubax and we'll talk about that.",59,,
388,0.97,2261.492,2271.302,And then we have the planning Commission and design Commission that is housed in Opcd.,59,,
389,0.97,2271.302,2271.802,Next slide.,59,,
390,0.97,2271.802,2274.672,So it's divided into three sections.,59,,
391,0.97,2274.672,2277.575,The planning section is the primary function.,59,,
392,0.97,2277.575,2296.193,The budget that you see on the slide also includes this year one time $50 million from the Mercer Mega-Block that the Mayor put in her budget to address some of the topical issues we'll be discussing today.,59,,
393,0.97,2296.193,2296.394,Next.,59,,
394,0.97,2296.394,2297.028,2020 work plan.,59,,
395,0.97,2297.028,2300.665,"This is, I'm not going to go through this, the list.",59,,
396,0.97,2300.665,2309.874,But I just want to highlight a few of them that are relevant to our conversation as well.,59,,
397,0.97,2309.874,2310.074,Next.,59,,
398,0.97,2310.074,2313.911,This year we'll be initiating the next updates to the comprehensive plan.,59,,
399,0.97,2313.911,2319.116,Every 5-8 years we are required to update the comprehensive plan.,59,,
400,0.97,2319.116,2326.157,"So any policy issues around race, social justice, equity issues are discussed as part of this.",59,,
401,0.97,2326.157,2333.23,And we'll look to what policies we need to put in place at the comprehensive plan levels.,59,,
402,0.97,2333.23,2339.103,That discussion will take place for the next three years actually.,59,,
403,0.97,2339.103,2343.374,The Mayor has initiated the industrial land discussion this year.,59,,
404,0.97,2343.374,2366.197,"So that is a robust process that has been initiated, and her primary directive in terms of the principles we need to address as we look at the entirety of our industrially zoned land and Maritime is to have Middle-Wage, Family-Wage jobs as the primary focus in advancing that.",59,,
405,0.97,2366.197,2373.137,"So if and when land use policies come into place, it has to be through that filter.",59,,
406,0.97,2373.137,2377.475,How do we maintain existing work force we have today.,59,,
407,0.97,2377.475,2381.812,"500,000 people are employed in our industrial lands.",59,,
408,0.97,2381.812,2384.615,That's almost 20% of our jobs.,59,,
409,0.97,2384.615,2393.724,"But not only maintain that, but how do we prepare the city for the change that is coming, that is here today in terms of the economy?",59,,
410,0.97,2393.724,2394.825,And we'll talk about that.,59,,
411,0.97,2394.825,2397.962,"And what the future is in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years.",59,,
412,0.97,2397.962,2418.416,"And what do we need to do from the levers we have, including potentially through land use, to make sure that we target our resources and levers Oh to address the future of employment focusing on those Middle-Wage and Family-Wage jobs?",59,,
413,0.97,2418.416,2418.616,Next.,59,,
414,0.97,2418.616,2424.155,"Economic development initiatives, we'll talk more about that as we move forward.",59,,
415,0.97,2424.155,2424.355,Next.,59,,
416,0.97,2424.355,2434.165,So this equitable development initiative was initiated because of the last comprehensive plan update in 2016.,59,,
417,0.97,2434.165,2456.053,"Equity, racial justice, and looking at our city policies around land and how we use our land through that lens led to the analysis of what we have and what do we need to know around race and social justice issues from a Land-Use perspective?",59,,
418,0.97,2456.053,2477.441,"The comprehensive plan identified that as an important tool and issue that then led us to prepare an equitable development plan initiative and financial strategy bringing that 50,000 level policy that was incorporated into the plan down to the ground and actually start implementing it.",59,,
419,0.97,2477.441,2477.675,Next.,59,,
420,0.97,2477.675,2490.654,"So, and that whole analysis was grounded on the history of decisions that were made 40, 50, 60 years ago around land use.",59,,
421,0.97,2490.654,2494.925,The map you see on the screen is a red lining map for Seattle.,59,,
422,0.97,2494.925,2499.73,"This is not different from many cities around the country, metropolitan areas.",59,,
423,0.97,2499.73,2513.21,"These are established in the '20s, '30s, and '40s not only by private entities and banks but actually supported by Federal Government policies as well as local government policies.",59,,
424,0.97,2513.21,2523.387,The reason I'm pointing that out is some of the issues that we're dealing with today and specific to community wealth is directly linked for the most part to that.,59,,
425,0.97,2523.387,2529.26,And we'll talk about that as we get to the round table.,59,,
426,0.97,2529.26,2535.266,That is an important component from a land use perspective and from where we sit.,59,,
427,0.97,2535.266,2540.771,And that help inform our policies we've developed over the last few years.,59,,
428,0.97,2540.771,2540.971,Next.,59,,
429,0.97,2540.971,2558.389,"And on that basis in 2016, we actually did sort of Quantifiable analysis of where we are today in terms of issues of displacement risk as well as lack of access to opportunity for people who live in Seattle.",59,,
430,0.97,2558.389,2561.191,"Not surprisingly, so this is kind of a hit map.",59,,
431,0.97,2561.191,2573.037,"The map on the left, the reddish colors or yellow point areas that have significant displacement risk in the city.",59,,
432,0.97,2573.037,2590.955,"On the right, the map shows where lack of access to opportunity for education, job access, transit, and the Darker/Browner color actually implies there's lack of access in those areas.",59,,
433,0.97,2590.955,2596.393,"Incidentally but not surprisingly, these maps match the maps from the '20s and '30s in terms of red lining.",59,,
434,0.97,2596.393,2604.635,"There's a link, and those are the backbone that we're dealing with today and the issues that we have been addressing.",59,,
435,0.97,2604.635,2604.935,Next slide.,59,,
436,0.97,2604.935,2605.235,Sure.,60,,
437,0.97,2605.235,2611.241,"I think we should point out that when you look at the map that you showed us before, the first one.",60,,
438,0.97,2611.241,2611.942,Yeah.,61,,
439,0.97,2611.942,2615.245,That was before the North end Wassen Annexed.,62,,
440,0.97,2615.245,2615.612,That's true.,63,,
441,0.97,2615.612,2623.354,"It doesn't line up with the low opportunity, high displacement.",64,,
442,0.97,2623.354,2625.889,It doesn't include the whole North end.,64,,
443,0.97,2625.889,2629.893,"No, it doesn't.",65,,
444,0.97,2629.893,2631.462,But this map does.,66,,
445,0.97,2631.462,2639.603,And the Anal security analysis.,67,,
446,0.97,2639.603,2642.773,Wanted to make sure that's clear for the viewing public.,68,,
447,0.97,2642.773,2664.962,"The program came out of a plan that was produced right at the end of the last conference upon updates to identify key priorities, how we become intentional in addressing and mitigating displacement but also creating wealth in areas that have been affected the most.",69,,
448,0.97,2664.962,2679.443,And how we distribute the growth that the region is experiencing so that it is inclusive for people of color and others who are left behind.,69,,
449,0.97,2679.443,2679.643,Next.,69,,
450,0.97,2679.643,2687.284,"Now, I'll sort of, this has been established for almost three and a half years ago.",69,,
451,0.97,2687.284,2690.754,"Three years ago within Opcd, it is a Multi-Departmental effort.",69,,
452,0.97,2690.754,2700.998,"We put together a team from office of economic development, arts, office of housing, who am I missing?",69,,
453,0.97,2700.998,2716.38,"The Department of neighborhood and civil rights as part of the team that has been developing this new initiative over the last three years, and we'll talk about some of the results and outcomes and what the work program is moving forward.",69,,
454,0.97,2716.38,2724.154,"With that, I'll ask Ubax to walk us through the nuts and bolts of this program.",69,,
455,0.97,2724.154,2724.521,Thank you.,70,,
456,0.97,2724.521,2728.092,You have to get real close.,71,,
457,0.97,2728.092,2730.828,"Thank you, Sam.",72,,
458,0.97,2730.828,2739.903,The six equity drivers are designed to be deployed together in order to make the equitable development outcomes.,72,,
459,0.97,2739.903,2752.816,Opcd being the kind of leading collaborative planning with all these departments plus the community.,72,,
460,0.97,2752.816,2763.127,"Mitigating displacement and increasing access to opportunity, it's really important to build the local cultural assets of those communities.",72,,
461,0.97,2763.127,2774.705,"It was born out of a strong inside, outside strategy and having a very strong organized voice in those communities that were impacted by displacement and growth.",72,,
462,0.97,2774.705,2784.448,"A lot of times when we talk about equitable development, people go into the Transactional funding piece, but it's more than that.",72,,
463,0.97,2784.448,2804.935,"The programs and policies and the coordination but also monetary program that is designed to provide public with the information on how Seattle is doing in achieving the outcomes, plus providing community Stakeholders with the data they need to organize and move their projects and programs forward.",72,,
464,0.97,2804.935,2820.35,"And then recently, also using that data to provide information for both the city and using it for the equity tool kit with the Department of neighborhoods and office of civil rights.",72,,
465,0.97,2820.35,2820.584,Quick.,72,,
466,0.97,2820.584,2826.557,And it's just two types of indicators.,72,,
467,0.97,2826.557,2843.307,"Again, the community indicators showing us if we're really making progress toward reducing racial disparities and looking at where displacement is happening to figure out how we deploy those resources that have high displacement risk.",72,,
468,0.97,2843.307,2851.548,We're doing this in two phases being led by our Demographer Diana.,72,,
469,0.97,2851.548,2857.821,"We are in the process of finalizing phase one report, hopefully by the end of March.",72,,
470,0.97,2857.821,2864.795,"Studying the phase two report, we hope we have something in the end of June, July.",72,,
471,0.97,2864.795,2866.23,Quickly.,72,,
472,0.97,2866.23,2866.73,"And those, sorry.",73,,
473,0.97,2866.73,2871.802,"But the indicators for phase one and two, will they be available in the report?",73,,
474,0.97,2871.802,2872.436,Yes.,74,,
475,0.97,2872.436,2883.914,And then we can also open to experts working on that coming and presenting to this committee once it's ready.,74,,
476,0.97,2883.914,2884.314,"Oh, Yeah.",74,,
477,0.97,2884.314,2894.424,"So and then the fund itself, which is targeting Place-Based community strategies started with the first initial $16 million.",74,,
478,0.97,2894.424,2897.527,The sale finalized last month.,74,,
479,0.97,2897.527,2903.433,"And then we have an annual $4 30,000 community development grant.",74,,
480,0.97,2903.433,2908.672,We were able to partner with our partners at the Department of economic development.,74,,
481,0.97,2908.672,2914.611,"They did all the heavy lifting, the work, and they're going to talk about that.",74,,
482,0.97,2914.611,2920.751,And then the $5 million a year that started last year from the short-term rental.,74,,
483,0.97,2920.751,2929.026,And then this one-time $15 million for this year we're working together on putting together the structure of how we deploy it.,74,,
484,0.97,2929.026,2935.265,"The maps, one from 1930s and one from four years ago, which hasn't changed much.",74,,
485,0.97,2935.265,2950.847,The key principle of the equitable development fund is addressing historic and market inequities through investing in Community-Driven projects from marginalized communities that have been impacted the most.,74,,
486,0.97,2950.847,2962.192,We have two different categories we found where we do community capacity development for groups Visioning projects and supporting them.,74,,
487,0.97,2962.192,2969.466,And just using the Edi fund as a catalyst to move community vision for brick and mortar projects.,74,,
488,0.97,2969.466,2977.708,Project development that includes anything from Pre- development all the way to site control.,74,,
489,0.97,2977.708,2979.609,But copying our investment at $1 million.,74,,
490,0.97,2979.609,2987.751,We are realizing the last two and a half years and capping it at $1 million does not even buy you a house in some areas of the city of Seattle.,74,,
491,0.97,2987.751,2997.594,That has also been a barrier and challenge for some of the projects to move forward in site control leads.,74,,
492,0.97,2997.594,3022.052,"The projects that right now we are supporting as a team, the initial five projects that were the catalyst of the Edi Fund, we did a process in partnership with those communities in 2018, and we were able to bring 10 projects into the pipeline that has mixed, different projects.",74,,
493,0.97,3022.052,3035.132,"We had child care projects to Mixed-Use projects, to projects that were just trying right now and small businesses are being we want to do something about it in the immigrant communities.",74,,
494,0.97,3035.132,3037.934,How can the Edi fund help us with that?,74,,
495,0.97,3037.934,3046.209,"In 2019, we were able to bring another 12 projects into the pipeline.",74,,
496,0.97,3046.209,3051.014,With a total of about $21 million.,74,,
497,0.97,3051.014,3051.381,"Sorry, Ubax.",75,,
498,0.97,3051.381,3053.083,$21 million deployed so far.,76,,
499,0.97,3053.083,3055.152,You have a question?,77,,
500,0.97,3055.152,3056.186,Thank you.,78,,
501,0.97,3056.186,3066.696,"So the theme of the Edi projects, is it to, is it addressing something after it's happening?",78,,
502,0.97,3066.696,3068.999,Or preventing or prohibiting displacement generally?,78,,
503,0.97,3068.999,3078.875,So the Foundational aspect of the program is actually it's community initiated.,79,,
504,0.97,3078.875,3081.611,And there's some Criterias developed.,79,,
505,0.97,3081.611,3092.589,"From capacity building to actual projects that are proposed by community groups that come from those geographic areas, the map that I showed that has a risk of displacement.",79,,
506,0.97,3092.589,3109.673,"And they range in, you know, from building a community center, Childcare, to a good amount of capacity building to get them ready to be able to actually develop or own their own Oh properties.",79,,
507,0.97,3109.673,3112.542,Whatever that program they propose might be.,79,,
508,0.97,3112.542,3116.446,They're almost always initiated by the community.,79,,
509,0.97,3116.446,3120.851,"It's mixed, building community capacity for Self- determination.",80,,
510,0.97,3120.851,3127.691,"The action coalition is a group in Rainier Beach that participated, for example, on the neighborhood plan.",80,,
511,0.97,3127.691,3141.905,"And they had some goals and outcomes in that neighborhood plan where right now they're utilizing the Edi fund to Actualize those programs around economic development, for example.",80,,
512,0.97,3141.905,3156.72,"These projects I call hungry because we go to let's just invest in a building, this is the efficient way to go, but what about groups like Lake City that's just hungry to start Visioning a project that benefits their community?",80,,
513,0.97,3156.72,3165.896,"It's that spectrum from, you know, build capacity for Self- determination to groups that are just actually starting construction, you know?",80,,
514,0.97,3165.896,3178.241,"And coming in for the Non- residential portion of that and Leveraging other departments like office of housing, doing the affordable housing, like for example the chief Seattle club.",80,,
515,0.97,3178.241,3178.842,Thank you.,81,,
516,0.97,3178.842,3179.376,Thank you guys.,82,,
517,0.97,3179.376,3191.655,I remember when we first sold that property and then how there was all these projects that came up in 18 and 19 and how you went through the six equity drivers.,82,,
518,0.97,3191.655,3191.888,Right.,82,,
519,0.97,3191.888,3196.193,"So a lot of people, I was in community two nights ago up in the North end.",82,,
520,0.97,3196.193,3197.761,They were asking about this fund again.,82,,
521,0.97,3197.761,3199.629,We were talking about the priorities.,82,,
522,0.97,3199.629,3203.767,A lot of communities don't understand that we have the equity drivers here.,82,,
523,0.97,3203.767,3210.006,"But how they were weighted, can you talk a little bit about when people were applying for this money?",82,,
524,0.97,3210.006,3212.442,Some people didn't get it and they were not happy.,82,,
525,0.97,3212.442,3215.312,We said come back for that second round.,82,,
526,0.97,3215.312,3219.249,And how each of these categories were weighted for that community project.,82,,
527,0.97,3219.249,3220.517,It can just be brief.,82,,
528,0.97,3220.517,3220.784,Sure.,83,,
529,0.97,3220.784,3221.451,Go for it.,84,,
530,0.97,3221.451,3221.751,Sure.,85,,
531,0.97,3221.751,3232.429,So the community drivers are are one of the primary focus of the scoring criteria that we use for determining the funding.,85,,
532,0.97,3232.429,3245.775,Part of that is really to help projects think about the multiple avenues in which community development happens and to avoid getting stuck in a single Lane of kind of function.,85,,
533,0.97,3245.775,3250.68,"So yes, affordable housing is important as much as possible.",85,,
534,0.97,3250.68,3253.783,How does it contribute to community wealth building?,85,,
535,0.97,3253.783,3271.868,Requiring the multiple equity drivers is one of the ways we try to get project proposals to really look at the community they're serving and the different needs there and say how are you thinking about the community as a comprehensive people and not just as the functional Lane that your organization is used to working in?,85,,
536,0.97,3271.868,3277.44,"I think by putting these organizations through the paces, that made them better organizations.",86,,
537,0.97,3277.44,3279.509,I really appreciated that.,86,,
538,0.97,3279.509,3282.779,That was a wonderful byproduct.,86,,
539,0.97,3282.779,3288.618,The ones who didn't get money understood where they were vulnerable and where they had to beef up.,86,,
540,0.97,3288.618,3288.885,Correct?,86,,
541,0.97,3288.885,3289.486,You're absolutely right.,87,,
542,0.97,3289.486,3297.827,Part of the process in the structure is to engage those communities before they submit the Rfp.,87,,
543,0.97,3297.827,3303.233,A lot of stuff goes out and works with communities to get them ready to apply.,87,,
544,0.97,3303.233,3310.44,"Most importantly, post application and award we go back to them and actually walk them through what worked, what didn't work.",87,,
545,0.97,3310.44,3319.249,"And that is part of the, the big part of the work is really building that capacity through the experience that we went through this process.",87,,
546,0.97,3319.249,3319.516,Yeah.,88,,
547,0.97,3319.516,3331.161,"I want to add one more thing around the criteria and making sure that, you know, they meet at least three of the equity drivers.",88,,
548,0.97,3331.161,3335.565,We got about 37 applications in 2018.,88,,
549,0.97,3335.565,3338.468,35 in 2019.,88,,
550,0.97,3338.468,3339.669,And we had around $5.5 million.,88,,
551,0.97,3339.669,3346.609,The direction that we gave the review committee was give us a balance of shovel ready and shovel handy projects.,88,,
552,0.97,3346.609,3348.678,Give us a balance of project types.,88,,
553,0.97,3348.678,3362.092,"Make sure that we get a balance of geographical, so you don't give us a bunch of projects in Southeast Seattle, right?",88,,
554,0.97,3362.092,3365.762,Sometimes these projects have really good proposals and things like that.,88,,
555,0.97,3365.762,3368.331,But just recognizing we also have limited resources to move.,88,,
556,0.97,3368.331,3383.213,"And just continue to work with these groups around real estate training programs or, you know, and just giving them feedback and things like that and just recognizing that it's a competitive process.",88,,
557,0.97,3383.213,3384.881,Not everybody's going to get funded.,88,,
558,0.97,3384.881,3391.221,"We have just a few minutes left, and we haven't gotten to the work plan yet.",89,,
559,0.97,3391.221,3391.855,"Ha, ha, ha.",89,,
560,0.97,3391.855,3392.155,Sure.,90,,
561,0.97,3392.155,3406.836,So we're highlighting a few of our partners' projects just as a way to start helping frame what we mean when we're talking about equitable development projects.,90,,
562,0.97,3406.836,3416.513,Because Reframing things and thinking about them from communities and community organizations are trying to do helps change the way we think about what a project is supposed to accomplish.,90,,
563,0.97,3416.513,3424.454,"So you know, we're highlighting one of our recent projects that just came in last year.",90,,
564,0.97,3424.454,3425.822,It was the Duwamish long house.,90,,
565,0.97,3425.822,3440.67,How we and they in their application talked about community wealth not just being dollars and cents but a conversation about history and culture and the cultural assets and how we're try together do that.,90,,
566,0.97,3440.67,3442.472,They're a great example.,90,,
567,0.97,3442.472,3448.244,"You know, the displacement for the native American community goes back well before red lining.",90,,
568,0.97,3448.244,3452.582,It's fundamental to the history of the Seattle.,90,,
569,0.97,3452.582,3462.425,"So you know, how we think about what assets mean as a community is a very different conversation than just solely talking about the racial wealth gap.",90,,
570,0.97,3462.425,3470.3,And Ubax talked a little bit about the work in Rainier Beach around the food cultures and the asset that is the food cultures.,90,,
571,0.97,3470.3,3484.047,And how do we use the assets and the cultures that are there to create Living-Wage jobs that can actually start to affect the disparity of jobs and income that is in Southeast Seattle compared to other parts of the city?,90,,
572,0.97,3484.047,3487.684,"I took that picture of the farm stand, by the way.",91,,
573,0.97,3487.684,3491.621,I'm just saying.,91,,
574,0.97,3491.621,3493.056,It's a good one.,92,,
575,0.97,3493.056,3509.105,The black and Tan hall is another example of a new and extremely interesting Community- led project centered around investors within a neighborhood coming together to create an ownership opportunity that actually will generate wealth.,92,,
576,0.97,3509.105,3516.746,It's also an area where one of the things that's interesting to us is I think we learn with our partners about how to structure their program.,92,,
577,0.97,3516.746,3521.951,"This is an example where they said, you know, we're a For- profit.",92,,
578,0.97,3521.951,3522.318,Can we apply?,92,,
579,0.97,3522.318,3527.29,"We were like, we had never thought about this before.",92,,
580,0.97,3527.29,3532.962,We were focused on 501C-3's.,92,,
581,0.97,3532.962,3547.277,Maybe we can think about changing our criteria for For- profits focused on community building if they can demonstrate an extraordinary level of community connection.,92,,
582,0.97,3547.277,3551.981,"Yes, this is about creating wealth for the residents for the purpose of reducing displacement.",92,,
583,0.97,3551.981,3557.82,We don't want to take the ability to create wealth off the table by having everybody have to be a non-profit.,92,,
584,0.97,3557.82,3563.226,We want to be able to somehow find a way to creatively work with those organizations.,92,,
585,0.97,3563.226,3573.703,"And when they have creative ideas, figure out how our program can adapt to be able to support those when they're valid.",92,,
586,0.97,3573.703,3584.48,"The Midtown Plaza, liberty Bank, we're highlighting this one as an example of what happens when Community-Based organizations can control their own development process.",92,,
587,0.97,3584.48,3604.167,"This is an example of Africa town and black community and black alliance using the development process to help provide education for the community about what development means, what Gentrification means, what opportunities are there in land trust.",92,,
588,0.97,3604.167,3616.813,Not only do you get a great building and soon to be two great buildings but you get this other conversation and community around the organizing that needs to happen for those strategies to be successful in the long term.,92,,
589,0.97,3616.813,3622.251,And then the last ones we have are both what Ubax referred to as shovel hungry.,92,,
590,0.97,3622.251,3632.228,"One is the African business alliance, which is strategies around how do we help African, black, and Muslim women create small businesses and expand them?",92,,
591,0.97,3632.228,3641.604,And what does it look like to have the capacity and backbone support to even start a conversation with a group that diverse around what a shared goal would be?,92,,
592,0.97,3641.604,3654.917,"And Similarly, that's kind of the conversation that's going on in Lake City collective of how do we support the Visioning to be able to come up with a project and be able to partner through the length of time it would take for a community to have that?",92,,
593,0.97,3654.917,3662.225,And how do we as a program commit to being a partner to make sure they have the stability to do that work?,92,,
594,0.97,3662.225,3668.097,"And quickly, this is the 2020 Edi work plan.",93,,
595,0.97,3668.097,3671.934,Figuring out a criteria to deploy the $15 million from this year.,93,,
596,0.97,3671.934,3674.604,Finalizing a permanent advisory board with recruitment.,93,,
597,0.97,3674.604,3685.948,"We've been working with an interim advisory board, coordinating with the strategic investment fund, which is different from the $15 million with our partners in other departments.",93,,
598,0.97,3685.948,3691.354,And then figuring out when we're going to start a 2020 Edi Fund.,93,,
599,0.97,3691.354,3695.658,Those people that never got funded or people who are new.,93,,
600,0.97,3695.658,3699.695,And sometimes we just get all those Unicorn projects.,93,,
601,0.97,3699.695,3702.732,"Finalizing the Edi monitoring, at least the phase one report.",93,,
602,0.97,3702.732,3723.052,"And then while we're doing all that, providing contract management and technical assistance for all the 25 projects and working with them to come up with a Sustainability plan and supporting our comprehensive plan team around analysis for the next major plan.",93,,
603,0.97,3723.052,3727.09,It's not a lot.,93,,
604,0.97,3727.09,3727.957,We're just slacking.,93,,
605,0.97,3727.957,3728.191,Wow.,94,,
606,0.97,3728.191,3728.458,Amazing.,94,,
607,0.97,3728.458,3728.758,Thank you.,94,,
608,0.97,3728.758,3732.495,Any final questions from the committee members?,94,,
609,0.97,3732.495,3732.695,Okay.,94,,
610,0.97,3732.695,3734.063,That was fantastic.,94,,
611,0.97,3734.063,3734.53,Thank you so much.,94,,
612,0.97,3734.53,3740.603,We will see you again in a moment.,94,,
613,0.97,3740.603,3742.071,Where are we?,95,,
614,0.97,3742.071,3742.371,Item three.,95,,
615,0.97,3742.371,3747.176,We'll move on to the third agenda item.,95,,

619,0.97,3760.49,3761.29,"Hello, everyone.",97,,
620,0.97,3761.29,3770.8,We're running a little behind.,97,,
621,0.97,3770.8,3780.743,Sorry about that.,97,,
622,0.97,3780.743,3785.181,I'm the policy manager.,98,,

626,0.97,3797.46,3798.027,Thank you.,102,,
627,0.97,3798.027,3802.598,Thank you so much for inviting us to present to your Committee.,103,,
628,0.97,3802.598,3824.587,"We're excited to be here at your first meeting . We'll talk about our strategic plan and what our role is building community power, trust, and wealth.",103,,
629,0.97,3824.587,3832.161,Latrice Ybarra who is our operations manager and holds a lot of the history of our organization is going to talk a little bit about our process here.,103,,
630,0.97,3832.161,3836.966,The next few day slides is about our mission and vision and values.,104,,
631,0.97,3836.966,3841.37,I've been with the office a little under 12 years.,104,,
632,0.97,3841.37,3847.076,And we had a mission Statemet that only spoke to the civil rights work in our office.,104,,
633,0.97,3847.076,3854.417,And what we didn't have was a mission and vision and values statement that spoke to the entire work of our office.,104,,
634,0.97,3854.417,3865.895,"And so in 2018, we began a deep process internally in our office to help us come up with our mission, vision, and values statements.",104,,
635,0.97,3865.895,3876.138,"It took us several months, many discussions, many tears, a lot for our office to really get to what the heart of our work is and what our values are.",104,,
636,0.97,3876.138,3880.876,"And you know, we were really excited when we finally got through this.",104,,
637,0.97,3880.876,3893.789,"Those of us who have been there a long time, we were excited that we had this product and it was something we all did together and it spoke to the values of our entire office and not just the civil rights, which is important.",104,,
638,0.97,3893.789,3895.424,But so is the rest of our work.,104,,
639,0.97,3895.424,3902.331,"With that, we had our values that we came up with, and they really are North Star.",104,,
640,0.97,3902.331,3914.977,"It's what we use to develop our strategic plan that, our Three- year strategic plan and these values is what we continue to look at as we develop our work plan for the year and the years to come forth.",104,,
641,0.97,3914.977,3924.654,And we always look at this and try to figure out how is our work making us accountable to the values we have?,104,,
642,0.97,3924.654,3934.363,"It's really, for me, I can speak personally for me, it's really important to me we have these values and that we look for these.",104,,
643,0.97,3934.363,3935.364,"Oh, Yeah.",105,,
644,0.97,3935.364,3936.032,Go ahead.,105,,
645,0.97,3936.032,3936.465,"Yes, please.",106,,
646,0.97,3936.465,3936.866,I'm sorry.,107,,
647,0.97,3936.866,3954.317,I just want to thank you so much because you're the only second organization I've seen on paper on your vision statement that add Colonization.,107,,
648,0.97,3954.317,3962.425,"The effects and the trauma it's created, the displacement, and to recognize it is a real piece of how we put the city back together.",107,,
649,0.97,3962.425,3964.994,I just want to thank you for that.,107,,
650,0.97,3964.994,3967.563,"There's only two organizations that have done that, and you're the second one.",107,,
651,0.97,3967.563,3969.198,I want to thank you for that.,107,,
652,0.97,3969.198,3969.598,Thank you.,108,,
653,0.97,3969.598,3973.803,That was part of what we wanted to discuss in all of our sessions that we had.,108,,
654,0.97,3973.803,3980.409,That was really important to call that out.,108,,
655,0.97,3980.409,3981.11,Because it's true.,108,,
656,0.97,3981.11,3994.724,"So as we go on with our slides here, we will talk more about our values and how they're part of our strategic plan.",108,,
657,0.97,3994.724,3995.124,Thank you.,109,,
658,0.97,3995.124,4006.569,"And Councilmember Juarez, you can rest assured every single word in our values, our mission, and our vision received a huge amount of discussion and process.",109,,
659,0.97,4006.569,4008.838,So it was extremely intentional.,109,,
660,0.97,4008.838,4011.507,And thank you for noticing that.,109,,
661,0.97,4011.507,4011.807,Thank you.,109,,
662,0.97,4011.807,4017.279,So these are are the Overarching goals for our Three- year strategic plan.,109,,
663,0.97,4017.279,4019.615,We're going to walk through them fairly quickly.,109,,
664,0.97,4019.615,4023.352,We know we're short on time.,109,,
665,0.97,4023.352,4025.454,"The first one, institutional culture shift.",109,,
666,0.97,4025.454,4037.7,"That goal is to guide and support the city of Seattle to center race in policymaking, power sharing, and developing accountable community relationships and racially just practices.",109,,
667,0.97,4037.7,4045.174,"To do that, our focus really on this one is internal to the city of Seattle.",109,,
668,0.97,4045.174,4056.519,To our employees and our leadership and we know that we have to get our own house in order before we can really have the credibility and the standing to work authentically in community.,109,,
669,0.97,4056.519,4060.623,So that's where this part of our strategic plan is focused.,109,,
670,0.97,4060.623,4066.695,So these are some of the ways in which we do that.,109,,
671,0.97,4066.695,4074.537,Directors forum is a peer forum for cabinet members to work on advancing racial equity in their departments.,109,,
672,0.97,4074.537,4087.249,"We hold and host the RSGI summit for organizers, community folks within our city departments who are working on racial equity.",109,,
673,0.97,4087.249,4092.455,Shape of trust was beautifully articulated in the office of arts and culture presentation.,109,,
674,0.97,4092.455,4115.144,"Another thing I would mention here, because it's fairly recent it didn't make it into the plan at that time, is we were recently approved to have our racial equity lab included in the innovation add Sizery Council set of five projects they'll be working on this year.",109,,
675,0.97,4115.144,4122.284,And that is a Multi-Layered platform that will help fortify racial equity work and organizing in city government.,109,,
676,0.97,4122.284,4137.8,"It will provide many different types of tools for decision makers, Stakeholders, and policymakers to use so that they can center race and all other forms of oppression in making their decisions.",109,,
677,0.97,4137.8,4141.971,And one of the aspects of those is an equity index.,109,,
678,0.97,4141.971,4148.043,So that will be a very interactive tool that we'll use on multiple data sets.,109,,
679,0.97,4148.043,4148.844,We're excited about that.,109,,
680,0.97,4148.844,4157.786,We're excited to be among those selected to work with some of our high-powered Tech companies in the coming year.,109,,
681,0.97,4157.786,4165.694,"And then we provide technical expertise throughout city departments, through RSGI training.",109,,
682,0.97,4165.694,4173.002,The RSGI team also supports the racial equity tool kits that are conducted throughout city departments.,109,,
683,0.97,4173.002,4179.508,"They support Caucusing and affinity groups, and we hold the gender justice work of the city and the expertise for that.",109,,
684,0.97,4179.508,4193.155,"So we provide technical assistance and training, coaching and support to leadership and departments throughout the city in the that area.",109,,
685,0.97,4193.155,4199.194,Another area that we're focused on for the next few years is work force equity.,109,,
686,0.97,4199.194,4215.477,To ensure that Socr is a workplace where individuals can thrive that addresses structural issues through transparent and honest communication and where we are an accountable relationships with each other and the communities most impacted by structural and institutional racism.,109,,
687,0.97,4215.477,4219.248,"Again, this is an internal focus for us.",109,,
688,0.97,4219.248,4237.666,"Moving forward, we know that in many ways, we must, we have an obligation to model those behaviors and practices that we aim to support other departments in as far as centering race and leading with racial equity and social justice.",109,,
689,0.97,4237.666,4254.55,"So over the past few years and going forward, we've used multiple strategies, including healing circles and supporting professional development in a way that is much more intentional than we've had in the past.",109,,
690,0.97,4254.55,4268.797,"And then as far as making institutional change and leading with that, we're looking at ways in our Department to address and create criteria for providing merit pay.",109,,
691,0.97,4268.797,4273.936,Our change team charter is the one that has served as the model for the rest of the city and all departments.,109,,
692,0.97,4273.936,4278.741,We are now in the process of updating and revising that.,109,,
693,0.97,4278.741,4286.148,There has been quite a bit of culture change already in our city since it was first developed.,109,,
694,0.97,4286.148,4294.123,We're looking to again push the Nope and adjust that and have a new model for the city.,109,,
695,0.97,4294.123,4327.189,"And then internal communications and committing ourselves to examining internalized racial oppression and how it impacts all of our work and practices . Our third major strategic goal is increasing housing access and to ensure all people, especially those impacted by racism and discrimination in housing, which Manifests as displacement and homelessness are sheltered safely and Affordably in a way that meets their needs.",109,,
696,0.97,4327.189,4327.489,Next slide.,109,,
697,0.97,4327.489,4327.756,Sorry.,110,,
698,0.97,4327.756,4332.194,And there are three major areas in which we address housing access.,111,,
699,0.97,4332.194,4337.866,And we really try to look at this through a Holistic lens.,111,,
700,0.97,4337.866,4345.007,"While we know our civil rights enforcement provides critical release, it is on an individual level.",111,,
701,0.97,4345.007,4359.221,"While we have that strategy to provide individual relief for folks who are experiencing discrimination Accessing housing, we also ensure we're looking at Big-Picture strategy and institutional change through policy development.",111,,
702,0.97,4359.221,4366.295,"A lot of which we partner with other, all of which we partner with other departments.",111,,
703,0.97,4366.295,4383.912,"As you heard earlier from Sam and Ubax and Michael, we are a strong partner in the development initiative and their Anti-Displacement work group which I'll get into later and supporting the office of Housin and developing community preference guidelines.",111,,
704,0.97,4383.912,4397.926,We still have a lot of our RSGI team with helping other departments on racial equity Toolkits that address housing access and further housing access.,111,,
705,0.97,4397.926,4401.563,Hour fourth goal is related to criminal justice.,111,,
706,0.97,4401.563,4420.149,"Our goal is to reduce the Harms of the current criminal legal model by increasing institutional understanding, ensuring community support before proposing new policies, and investing in practices that offer a path toward replacing the current system.",111,,
707,0.97,4420.149,4427.256,"And like our other goals, we have a few different ways, a few different strategies and ways we're trying to reach this goal.",111,,
708,0.97,4427.256,4442.504,"I'll go into more depth if we have time later on our collaborative Began-Making process that is currently being implemented to invest in alternatives, Community-Based alternatives.",111,,
709,0.97,4442.504,4449.545,Current criminal legal system and address the Harms the current legal system has caused.,111,,
710,0.97,4449.545,4451.78,We're still implementing the recommendations from the work group.,111,,
711,0.97,4451.78,4459.421,Still working toward getting the city to reach its goal and see zero youth Incarceration.,111,,
712,0.97,4459.421,4473.836,And our big struggle and our value on our criminal legal team is trying to determine how we can be accountable to those most impacted by the criminal legal system who are also those most impacted by racism and discrimination.,111,,
713,0.97,4473.836,4493.856,"How we share information with them around current policy proposals that the city may be putting forth, build their Anal security interest, and bring them into processes and taking leadership from them when we need to interrupt system patterns that contribute to harm.",111,,
714,0.97,4493.856,4495.858,Goal five is advancing civil rights.,112,,
715,0.97,4495.858,4519.581,"One of the things that we have made this major shift in the last couple of years, especially under mission, vision, and values is how do we shift the way we do our work from shifting from just working on individual complaints coming into the door, focusing on more Proactive strategies, and systemic issues that impact communities of color and other communities.",112,,
716,0.97,4519.581,4530.158,Centering race in the development of new laws and advance racial equity through the every he Mentation through current civil rights laws using Proactive enforcement and community partnerships.,112,,
717,0.97,4530.158,4540.202,And we also do this to work to reduce barriers to access and promote self-determination.,112,,
718,0.97,4540.202,4546.008,What are those goals and strategies to address the advancement of civil rights?,112,,
719,0.97,4546.008,4553.548,"And in terms of policy development, we focused more on how do we engage community as being part of the solution making?",112,,
720,0.97,4553.548,4562.824,How do we engage community in coming up with ideas to advance civil rights no ensure everyone is protected with the least harm done?,112,,
721,0.97,4562.824,4578.24,"In terms of civil rights implementation, one of the areas we've been looking at and has been a journey for us is really thinking beyond this traditional notion of investigating complaints to be more Proactive.",112,,
722,0.97,4578.24,4589.117,"Being more Proactive in terms of educating communities around civil rights protections, which Council provided a position last year for.",112,,
723,0.97,4589.117,4602.197,And really integrating restorative practices and Council also provided us the position to think about and explore how are ways we can explore one option when people come to our door or our office.,112,,
724,0.97,4602.197,4603.465,A menu of options.,112,,
725,0.97,4603.465,4609.171,How do we address conflict in our communities whether it's on an individual level or a community basis?,112,,
726,0.97,4609.171,4617.946,And how do we facilitate those conversations to really encourage people to come fully and truthfully together?,112,,
727,0.97,4617.946,4621.917,"In terms of community impact, how do we actually shift the needle?",112,,
728,0.97,4621.917,4635.897,How do we actually shift the way we do our work to think more strategically and more Proactively to thinking more than the civil rights protections being the floor.,112,,
729,0.97,4635.897,4636.264,Beyond that.,112,,
730,0.97,4636.264,4647.209,Really bringing the community to the table and thinking about enforcement around our community and being more community centered.,112,,
731,0.97,4647.209,4653.782,So our team gave quite a bit of thought.,113,,
732,0.97,4653.782,4658.487,We appreciated your questions on how our work is leading to building community wealth.,113,,
733,0.97,4658.487,4677.139,"And because our office is not specifically focused on economic development, for example, or job creation, we wanted to look deeply into the goals that we have and our approach, which I think is probably coming through in all of the ways we've described our work.",113,,
734,0.97,4677.139,4692.421,"And what we believe is that all of our values and our principles guide our work and lead to the building of community, power, and wealth in multiple ways.",113,,
735,0.97,4692.421,4699.728,"And so for example, you've heard us talk about sharing decision making and planning power with community.",113,,
736,0.97,4699.728,4713.575,"And specifically, we look to do that with organized Anti-Racist communities of color to ensure that we are bringing that perspective to the table and especially to tables where we are at and they are not.",113,,
737,0.97,4713.575,4721.083,Ensure engagement with communities most impacted by institutional racism.,113,,
738,0.97,4721.083,4728.39,And I wanted to note here that our office supports as probably you all know four commissions.,113,,
739,0.97,4728.39,4739.167,"We support the Seattle human rights Commission, the women's Commission, the Commission for people with disabilities, and the Lgbtq Commission.",113,,
740,0.97,4739.167,4744.506,"Those commissions, you know, we are the staff support and also policy support for.",113,,
741,0.97,4744.506,4755.283,And they are a critical part of our ability to establish that bridge between the communities and constituencies that they represent and our office.,113,,
742,0.97,4755.283,4768.797,And so one of the things that we have been working on and we'll continue to do so in the coming years is really looking to see how do we strengthen those connections and our support?,113,,
743,0.97,4768.797,4783.512,"And so we're also very grateful that in the 2020 budget, we were provided a second Commission Liasion position that will allow us to have one Commission Liasion for each two commissions.",113,,
744,0.97,4783.512,4786.214,So we strongly believe that will help our level of support.,113,,
745,0.97,4786.214,4792.053,We have about 3 minutes left.,114,,
746,0.97,4792.053,4792.32,Okay.,115,,
747,0.97,4792.32,4792.654,All right.,115,,
748,0.97,4792.654,4801.93,"So I think, you know, our connection to community, power, and wealth has been touched on pretty much throughout our presentation.",115,,
749,0.97,4801.93,4809.538,I'm going to move on these specific examples.,115,,
750,0.97,4809.538,4809.738,Yeah.,115,,
751,0.97,4809.738,4810.138,In one minute.,115,,
752,0.97,4810.138,4829.891,"The collaborative grant making group was launched in January, and it was to distribute funds that were the result of organizing by justice coalition and epic, and the main goal of that funding process is to invest in Community-Based alternative toss the criminal legal system and address the Harms of the current system.",115,,
753,0.97,4829.891,4839.267,"And the reason why this is a unique model, unlike other distributing models throughout the city, is that the community members who are gathered together are in a collective.",115,,
754,0.97,4839.267,4844.573,"And they're there from the start, and they are the ones that are developing the theory of change.",115,,
755,0.97,4844.573,4847.876,What is the big impact this money is going to make?,115,,
756,0.97,4847.876,4849.744,It's a $1 million investment.,115,,
757,0.97,4849.744,4855.584,They will be creating the request for proposals and making the funding decisions.,115,,
758,0.97,4855.584,4863.925,So it's really shifting power back to community members to making decision making amongst a collective.,115,,
759,0.97,4863.925,4877.505,"And there's one thing I wanted to say, the big tenants that we learned or I learned from the people's Institute is that people are poor not because they lack programs and services but because they lack power.",115,,
760,0.97,4877.505,4900.729,"Úin all of our kind of Communit shifting or I guess culture shifting practices or real Hi thinking about how to distribute power and not just investing in programs and services but even in the creation of determining which programs and services get funded, how is power being shifted?",115,,
761,0.97,4900.729,4901.763,Thank you for that.,116,,
762,0.97,4901.763,4911.039,"And also, in terms of alternative enforcement, one of the things we have focused on.",117,,
763,0.97,4911.039,4912.641,Part of it came from last.,117,,
764,0.97,4912.641,4915.644,What was it the community needed from us?,117,,
765,0.97,4915.644,4923.051,What was it that community wanted from us when they had a complaint or felt like they were being discriminated?,117,,
766,0.97,4923.051,4923.518,They wanted options.,117,,
767,0.97,4923.518,4933.128,"They wanted the opportunity, not just to say I have a complaint and I want to know whether there's cause or no cause.",117,,
768,0.97,4933.128,4939.868,But really that Participatery process of addressing how we can address discrimination issues.,117,,
769,0.97,4939.868,4951.446,"When we talk about alternative enforcement, I want to call out that it's expanding from a responsive model, which people see as investigations and mediation.",117,,
770,0.97,4951.446,4956.117,"But being more Proactive, more advocacy through our testing program, and developing a restorative model.",117,,
771,0.97,4956.117,4965.827,To be able to bring community to the table when these conversations are necessary.,117,,
772,0.97,4965.827,4975.904,"And to be honest, a lot of these housing access strategies were beautifully highlighted by our partners in the Edi initiative.",118,,
773,0.97,4975.904,4978.273,So I think you heard a lot from them.,118,,
774,0.97,4978.273,4995.223,The only thing I would add is that the community preference policy we're working on with the office of housing is another innovative strategy to address displacement and increase housing access for those who have been left out of that opportunity.,118,,
775,0.97,4995.223,4995.89,Thank you.,119,,
776,0.97,4995.89,4997.959,Thank you.,120,,
777,0.97,4997.959,5000.929,Any questions from folks before we?,121,,
778,0.97,5000.929,5006.568,"I might just really briefly, I just want to thank everyone for their presentation.",122,,
779,0.97,5006.568,5017.045,"As someone who served on the Seattle human rights Commission a while ago, I know Councilmember Strauss served recently.",122,,
780,0.97,5017.045,5024.652,I have a lot of respect and admiration for the office of civil rights and I look forward to working with you through this Committee.,122,,
781,0.97,5024.652,5025.353,Thank you.,123,,
782,0.97,5025.353,5038.6,"I do want to acknowledge that we are operating in a particular kind of structure that is, some might say a white Supremacist structure where there's an agenda and time keeping.",124,,
783,0.97,5038.6,5046.908,I want to thank you for your indulgence as we try to move through this and also to thank you for your acknowledgment that community needs to be at the table.,124,,
784,0.97,5046.908,5049.277,But want this to be an overview.,124,,
785,0.97,5049.277,5062.29,"We do have a special meeting planned, which I'll talk about afterward, where we will have community members at the table to share their thoughts about how city is Impacting their ability to do their work.",124,,
786,0.97,5062.29,5063.091,Thank you.,124,,
787,0.97,5063.091,5063.825,Thank you.,125,,
788,0.97,5063.825,5064.192,Oh okay.,126,,
789,0.97,5064.192,5070.532,So we are going to move on to the fourth agenda item.,126,,
790,0.97,5070.532,5078.74,"Office of economic development, Oed overview and discussion of the 2020 work plan.",127,,

792,0.97,5079.274,5079.641,Thank you.,128,,
793,0.97,5079.641,5089.884,And so we have the Presenters from the office of economic development coming.,128,,
794,0.97,5089.884,5090.285,"Hello, everyone.",128,,

798,0.97,5103.097,5105.934,"This is on, is it on?",129,,
799,0.97,5105.934,5109.37,If the light is green.,130,,

807,0.97,5132.927,5134.262,Great.,136,,
808,0.97,5134.262,5134.562,Thank you.,136,,
809,0.97,5134.562,5138.166,I'm going to have to excuse Karl because of the recent shooting.,137,,
810,0.97,5138.166,5148.81,"We have a project we need to work on, and Karl has been called in to do a specific task.",137,,
811,0.97,5148.81,5149.077,Yes.,138,,
812,0.97,5149.077,5150.378,"Thank you, Karl.",139,,
813,0.97,5150.378,5162.357,"So before we start, what I would do is having been a former elected official myself, I go through a lot of presentations, and I remember how difficult it is to go through a lot of presentations.",139,,
814,0.97,5162.357,5169.631,"What I'm going to do is really highlight and if you have questions, we can kind of dive in with more specifics.",139,,
815,0.97,5169.631,5171.232,I'm going to pass this out.,139,,
816,0.97,5171.232,5177.305,"And this kind of summarizes our structure and our sort of programming, core programs.",139,,
817,0.97,5177.305,5184.212,And also the amount in terms of budget investments that you're making on various core services.,139,,
818,0.97,5184.212,5190.218,"Instead of going into all the details, do you mind driving a little bit?",139,,
819,0.97,5190.218,5192.62,"On every single slide, I'm going to summarize.",139,,
820,0.97,5192.62,5197.559,"If you catch something, just Chime in, and we can dive in at that point.",139,,
821,0.97,5197.559,5197.825,Okay.,140,,
822,0.97,5197.825,5202.997,But the economy here in Seattle is what I call a Binary economy.,141,,
823,0.97,5202.997,5208.636,"We have a lot of low-wage jobs, Middle-Wage jobs, and a lot of high-wage jobs.",141,,
824,0.97,5208.636,5214.442,"In general if you want to build an inclusive economy, what you want is more of a a Bell curve.",141,,
825,0.97,5214.442,5218.179,A lot of Middle-Wage jobs and a little bit at both ends.,141,,
826,0.97,5218.179,5223.451,We have a Binary economy that's creating inequities in the city.,141,,
827,0.97,5223.451,5227.255,And so this is sort of the problem statement.,141,,
828,0.97,5227.255,5232.16,My Department's job is to illustrate this problem and invest in programs to build more of a Bell curve over time.,141,,
829,0.97,5232.16,5237.999,"And so if you want to move forward, in general I'll fly through this.",141,,
830,0.97,5237.999,5239.767,The economy is booming on average.,141,,
831,0.97,5239.767,5246.574,We are growing at twice the rate in terms of job growth in terms of the national average.,141,,
832,0.97,5246.574,5257.085,The reason why is because Seattle has certain industry characteristics that has benefited from the transition from service economy to Knowledge-Based economy.,141,,
833,0.97,5257.085,5261.789,It has certain characteristics in Seattle that are unique.,141,,
834,0.97,5261.789,5265.193,"During this transition, Seattle really benefited from this transition.",141,,
835,0.97,5265.193,5270.265,"As a result, if you could go to the next slide, so this is from 2011.",141,,
836,0.97,5270.265,5273.835,And if you can keep your eyes on this.,141,,
837,0.97,5273.835,5277.005,In general on the left side are low-wage jobs.,141,,
838,0.97,5277.005,5281.943,The high-wage jobs are on the right side.,141,,
839,0.97,5281.943,5282.243,2001?,142,,
840,0.97,5282.243,5282.944,This is 2001.,143,,
841,0.97,5282.944,5285.413,"I'll flip over to 2019, and you can see the change.",143,,
842,0.97,5285.413,5289.717,If you want to go back just one more time and show you the change.,143,,
843,0.97,5289.717,5298.826,What you see the a lot of growth in low-wage jobs and a lot of growth in high-wage jobs but not that much growth in the Middle-Wage jobs.,143,,
844,0.97,5298.826,5301.562,This illustrates the problem statement I'm proposing here.,143,,
845,0.97,5301.562,5310.772,"On the next slide, I'm flying through this here, is you can see from the retail jobs that grew at a rapid rate and software jobs, you see the inequity in terms of pay.",143,,
846,0.97,5310.772,5315.943,But these are the sectors that are growing the fastest in Seattle.,143,,
847,0.97,5315.943,5324.752,And people of color and Underserved communities are in the service sector economy.,143,,
848,0.97,5324.752,5328.089,"The overall economy is growing, and poverty is growing at the same time.",143,,
849,0.97,5328.089,5330.124,"By race, of course, you can see the distinction.",143,,
850,0.97,5330.124,5331.959,I know all of you know this.,143,,
851,0.97,5331.959,5336.698,"But by race, you can see the growing inequity.",143,,
852,0.97,5336.698,5338.166,We'll fly through this here.,143,,
853,0.97,5338.166,5344.072,"And the next one, in general the question is how do you then rebuild the Middle-Wage jobs?",143,,
854,0.97,5344.072,5347.775,"And so we have a modeling, we have a strategy in place.",143,,
855,0.97,5347.775,5350.044,We call it the economic gardening model.,143,,
856,0.97,5350.044,5353.648,We won't have time to go into it today.,143,,
857,0.97,5353.648,5355.883,Different departments own a different part of the sector.,143,,
858,0.97,5355.883,5361.589,These are part of our core strategies and they're outlined in a Rainbow here.,143,,
859,0.97,5361.589,5370.031,"There are different parts that play a role in our economic development, economic gardening model.",143,,
860,0.97,5370.031,5370.331,Next slide.,143,,
861,0.97,5370.331,5380.541,"So at a really high level, our small business team which Pedro is the manager of that team, we do an array of services.",143,,
862,0.97,5380.541,5389.15,"But from stabilizing small businesses, streamlining, helping small businesses get through the Beauracracy, we have a group called Cbat.",143,,
863,0.97,5389.15,5390.618,"Any problems, let us know.",143,,
864,0.97,5390.618,5395.022,We'll put them through this process.,143,,
865,0.97,5395.022,5396.324,It's a multi-agency Problem- solving team.,143,,
866,0.97,5396.324,5401.162,Like the Ballard fire that recently happened.,143,,
867,0.97,5401.162,5405.466,We case manage those catastrophic events as well.,143,,
868,0.97,5405.466,5405.8,Next slide?,143,,
869,0.97,5405.8,5407.635,I'm sorry.,144,,
870,0.97,5407.635,5408.903,"Bobby, can you define Micro- business?",144,,
871,0.97,5408.903,5412.673,It would be less than--you want to take this one?,145,,
872,0.97,5412.673,5412.974,Sure.,146,,
873,0.97,5412.974,5416.844,"It depends on who's asking, right?",146,,
874,0.97,5416.844,5417.845,So for the sake.,146,,
875,0.97,5417.845,5418.379,I'm asking.,147,,
876,0.97,5418.379,5427.255,"For the stabilization Fund, for example, the we use Cbdg money, so it has to be 5 or less employees.",148,,
877,0.97,5427.255,5427.655,Interesting.,149,,
878,0.97,5427.655,5429.891,"But in general, it's 1-50 employees.",150,,
879,0.97,5429.891,5435.363,But we don't have a super clear definition.,150,,
880,0.97,5435.363,5435.63,Okay.,151,,
881,0.97,5435.63,5442.136,It depends on the money that defines this thing.,152,,
882,0.97,5442.136,5453.948,"And I know chairman Morales, it's a Place-Based economic development strategy, which is in our opinion one of the most powerful ways of building wealth for our Underserved communities.",153,,
883,0.97,5453.948,5461.522,When we build capacity at a local level to make neighborhoods drive by making commercial corridors thrive.,153,,
884,0.97,5461.522,5467.995,The commercial corridors are truly an economic garden in which small businesses grow and scale.,153,,
885,0.97,5467.995,5470.731,"And often, these small businesses are from communities of color.",153,,
886,0.97,5470.731,5478.806,We have different areas on our photo.,153,,
887,0.97,5478.806,5482.743,"These are the investments, these are the program areas we invest in.",153,,
888,0.97,5482.743,5486.314,The yellow areas are what we call equity districts.,153,,
889,0.97,5486.314,5486.581,Okay.,154,,
890,0.97,5486.581,5489.116,And I'm sorry the slide doesn't show the map very well.,155,,
891,0.97,5489.116,5492.286,But you can see how the money is distributed.,155,,
892,0.97,5492.286,5495.957,"And down the road, we probably should dig in a little more.",155,,
893,0.97,5495.957,5503.931,This is a great program we think makes a real difference at the neighborhood level around supporting small businesses.,155,,
894,0.97,5503.931,5512.373,"And the key industry team, right now a major project you'll hear about soon to get you ready is the industrial land.",155,,
895,0.97,5512.373,5517.645,So there's multiple Stakeholders that were engaged in terms of industrial land.,155,,
896,0.97,5517.645,5525.553,"In terms of building middle- wage jobs for Underserved populations, industrial land can play a key role.",155,,
897,0.97,5525.553,5528.523,We're going with multiple Stakeholders in different neighborhoods.,155,,
898,0.97,5528.523,5530.658,You'll get an update on this issue down the road.,155,,
899,0.97,5530.658,5535.696,"We do a little bit of recruitment on the Ev, the electrical vehicle.",155,,
900,0.97,5535.696,5547.241,"We visited a company Inen San Francisco called Protera with the Mayor and looking for ways to Electrify, grow that electric vehicle cluster within Seattle.",155,,
901,0.97,5547.241,5558.819,"And then there's Mercer property we helped, through the Mercer property negotiation, we're trying to support the bio- Tech industry.",155,,
902,0.97,5558.819,5573.2,"And work force development team, when you think about work force, you're talking about training.",155,,
903,0.97,5573.2,5579.573,Nancy's Department handles execution of your investments around work force development.,155,,
904,0.97,5579.573,5580.041,Flying through this.,155,,
905,0.97,5580.041,5584.378,And then we have office film and music.,155,,
906,0.97,5584.378,5593.554,"Every economic development Department I managed, I just moved here last April and I was the director for Portland.",155,,
907,0.97,5593.554,5597.992,They also have a film concierge service like here in Seattle.,155,,
908,0.97,5597.992,5598.859,Seattle is much more advanced.,155,,
909,0.97,5598.859,5606.6,"Not only do they provide a central place for dealing with permitting process, but they have programs that come along with it.",155,,
910,0.97,5606.6,5612.606,These are one of the few cities where we have staff life around night life economic development.,155,,
911,0.97,5612.606,5631.559,"A high level to answer some of the questions they posed to get ready for this presentation, really moving forward I think Place-Based strategy is one of the areas we should really look at and use it as a meddle to empower communities to drive their own economic development strategies.",155,,
912,0.97,5631.559,5633.961,Only in Seattle has the infrastructure for that.,155,,
913,0.97,5633.961,5640.835,I think there's more opportunities to help advance that economic development philosophy.,155,,
914,0.97,5640.835,5649.176,"Stabilization Fund, a lot of small businesses, Micro- businesses through no fault of their own often hit barriers.",155,,
915,0.97,5649.176,5660.955,One help can go a long ways for generational wealth.,155,,
916,0.97,5660.955,5662.79,Expanding technical businesses owned by people of color.,155,,
917,0.97,5662.79,5675.002,One of the things we've learned in Seattle is we do the Census tracking for individuals but we don't have a lot of data around mall businesses.,155,,
918,0.97,5675.002,5681.609,Pedro wants to do a census but targeting small businesses so we have good data.,155,,
919,0.97,5681.609,5685.546,The one last thing here I put in place recession planning.,155,,
920,0.97,5685.546,5689.517,We had a full engagement with my Department around recession planning.,155,,
921,0.97,5689.517,5695.623,If we want to do something around the space dislocated workers program is probably an area we should talk about.,155,,
922,0.97,5695.623,5697.958,I'll leave it there and I think that's it.,155,,
923,0.97,5697.958,5703.23,So we just flew through it.,155,,
924,0.97,5703.23,5703.731,Nicely done.,156,,
925,0.97,5703.731,5704.732,Very good.,156,,
926,0.97,5704.732,5706.967,Were you all going to present?,156,,
927,0.97,5706.967,5707.568,You're here as backup?,156,,
928,0.97,5707.568,5712.239,"If you have questions, then we'll.",157,,
929,0.97,5712.239,5713.674,Are there questions?,158,,
930,0.97,5713.674,5715.242,Go for it.,158,,
931,0.97,5715.242,5716.143,Thanks for joining us.,159,,
932,0.97,5716.143,5716.544,Thank you.,160,,
933,0.97,5716.544,5722.55,"The theme of my questions are really to, how do we prevent economic displacement?",161,,
934,0.97,5722.55,5730.825,Some of the programs you're putting into place are after the fact and trying to compensate for something that's already happened.,161,,
935,0.97,5730.825,5737.865,Sometimes it's city policy that can cause or add fuel to the fire for the displacement.,161,,
936,0.97,5737.865,5749.61,"Is there, does your stabilization fund for small businesses help when, you know, there's a major Sdot project on a street for a year and people are having trouble Accessing the business?",161,,
937,0.97,5749.61,5750.344,Do you help with that?,161,,
938,0.97,5750.344,5752.613,You want to try that one?,162,,
939,0.97,5752.613,5753.914,This was our pilot program.,163,,
940,0.97,5753.914,5764.625,So this is a first time we were trying it out and absolutely businesses that were going through some type of construction impact were able to apply for this program.,163,,
941,0.97,5764.625,5766.861,So it does cover those as well.,163,,
942,0.97,5766.861,5769.163,"But you know, it was a pilot program.",163,,
943,0.97,5769.163,5772.333,So there were a lot of things we learned.,163,,
944,0.97,5772.333,5787.214,Lessons learned from this first one and we'll make adjustments for 20 20202 stabilization fund.,163,,
945,0.97,5787.214,5790.618,Allow for smaller amounts.,163,,
946,0.97,5790.618,5796.524,"Some businesses, $5000 or $10,000 will go a long for them.",163,,
947,0.97,5796.524,5801.362,"Absolutely, businesses that are dealing with construction impacts qualify for that.",163,,
948,0.97,5801.362,5813.24,"One point to note because this is an issue here in the state of Washington, not just in Seattle, is that your Constitution prevents the cities from making direct investments.",164,,
949,0.97,5813.24,5821.148,"What we're talking about, Pedro what he had to do is use Federal dollars to provide this program.",164,,
950,0.97,5821.148,5823.851,We can't use general funds.,164,,
951,0.97,5823.851,5826.921,"But CDBG money, there's not a whole lot to work with.",164,,
952,0.97,5826.921,5830.758,We're using a small amount of money to make this program work.,164,,
953,0.97,5830.758,5847.575,"One last thing with the stabilization Fund, in addition to receiving the money, what we're doing is we're also doing an assessment of the business to determine the overall needs the business has in order to not get to that point again.",165,,
954,0.97,5847.575,5857.284,"For example, we pair them with an accountant to make sure the business has the financial literacy they need to know how to invest that money they get.",165,,
955,0.97,5857.284,5865.726,"We pair them with a lease specialist to make sure their lease is, because that sometimes pushes businesses out.",165,,
956,0.97,5865.726,5873.868,"They sign a contract they don't understand, so we have a lease specialist that will sit down with them and look at their lease so in the future they can negotiate a better lease.",165,,
957,0.97,5873.868,5878.739,We try to offer a Wrap-Around service so it's not just a one- touch.,165,,
958,0.97,5878.739,5880.708,I'm glad you mentioned the lease support.,166,,
959,0.97,5880.708,5893.387,"On the ave in my district, there's a study done by Peter Steinberg showing 65% of the businesses owned by women or people of color, they're signing these long-term leases.",166,,
960,0.97,5893.387,5905.332,All of the businesses have this challenge of signing these long- term leases and they're Triple- net leases and the taxes and insurance pass straight through to them.,166,,
961,0.97,5905.332,5906.467,So they're getting this impact.,166,,
962,0.97,5906.467,5909.737,They can't just increase prices to make up for these additional costs.,166,,
963,0.97,5909.737,5911.472,Some of which are coming from the city.,166,,
964,0.97,5911.472,5911.739,Right.,167,,
965,0.97,5911.739,5930.09,"In fact, today we proposed to the Mayor's office that we should create a program that Proactively helps solve business owners before they sign the lease understand all the steps and the additional responsibilities and costs they will have to incur over time.",168,,
966,0.97,5930.09,5937.898,That's an important part of preventing people from getting into a situation that will cause huge negative impacts economically.,168,,
967,0.97,5937.898,5944.171,And it all needs to be translated into languages that our small businesses speak.,169,,
968,0.97,5944.171,5946.04,Thank you for your presentation.,169,,
969,0.97,5946.04,5957.551,I'm going to invite our other agencies back up so we can have a brief conversation together about the question of building community wealth.,169,,
970,0.97,5957.551,5963.223,Thank you for making your way up.,169,,
971,0.97,5963.223,5967.795,Thank you.,170,,
972,0.97,5967.795,5968.696,Appreciate it.,170,,
973,0.97,5968.696,5969.463,Thank you.,171,,
974,0.97,5969.463,5970.264,Do you need something?,171,,
975,0.97,5970.264,5973.834,My staff is gesturing they want to talk to me.,172,,
976,0.97,5973.834,5982.242,I'm worried I'll deny a Quorum if I walk out of the room.,172,,
977,0.97,5982.242,5982.543,Sure.,173,,
978,0.97,5982.543,5982.743,Here.,173,,
979,0.97,5982.743,5987.114,I'll leave this as insurance that I'll be back.,173,,
980,0.97,5987.114,5991.285,Will you read the final item into the record?,174,,
981,0.97,5991.285,5997.725,"Oed arts, a conversation around building community wealth.",175,,
982,0.97,5997.725,5998.292,Brieferring and discussion.,175,,
983,0.97,5998.292,6010.17,Thank you all for being here today and sharing what your prior Theties are for the year and for staying a little extra to have this broader conversation.,176,,
984,0.97,6010.17,6018.746,I wanted the opportunity for all of the departments that are in this committee to have a chance to talk together about what we mean when we talk about building community wealth.,176,,
985,0.97,6018.746,6031.892,And I think the committee members can benefit too from having this cross conversation so we begin the year all on the same page.,176,,
986,0.97,6031.892,6034.361,We excused Councilmember Juarez.,176,,
987,0.97,6034.361,6035.496,She had a family emergency.,176,,
988,0.97,6035.496,6035.963,Let's begin.,176,,
989,0.97,6035.963,6044.371,I'll throw a couple of questions out and let you have a conversation.,176,,
990,0.97,6044.371,6055.015,What are ways that you can collaborate as departments to build community wealth?,176,,
991,0.97,6055.015,6055.249,Sorry.,176,,
992,0.97,6055.249,6055.416,Oh.,176,,
993,0.97,6055.416,6057.684,We reorganized the questions and now I'm confused.,176,,
994,0.97,6057.684,6064.358,Do you know of any specific tools that could support building community wealth?,176,,
995,0.97,6064.358,6087.548,"And what can get in the way or what does get in the way of you doing the work that you think you could do or if you know of small businesses, community members, folks who are participating in the equitable development initiative or trying to who Maybe we would invite to the special committee to talk about how policy impacts their work.",176,,
996,0.97,6087.548,6092.853,Are there things that get in the way of us really being able to do this?,176,,
997,0.97,6092.853,6093.153,Right.,177,,
998,0.97,6093.153,6093.687,There's multiple issues.,177,,
999,0.97,6093.687,6105.766,How about if I start a little bit on workforce development and we can talk about wealth creation through your program and creative economy areas and cover it that way.,177,,
1000,0.97,6105.766,6113.607,Let me highlight a problem statement as to why we have this big challenge around displacement and lack of equitable economic growth.,177,,
1001,0.97,6113.607,6118.579,So the population has grown 20% in the last 8 years.,177,,
1002,0.97,6118.579,6124.451,Job occupation growth has grown 25% in the last 8 years.,177,,
1003,0.97,6124.451,6131.325,But the folks who benefited from the job growth are not local people.,177,,
1004,0.97,6131.325,6142.569,"It's people, talent you have to recruit from outside to come in that drove up the growth curve, that created housing values to go up.",177,,
1005,0.97,6142.569,6148.275,"And frankly, just a really tough place to be at if you're only making $40,000 a year.",177,,
1006,0.97,6148.275,6154.748,So the population growth is contributing to the inequity in Seattle.,177,,
1007,0.97,6154.748,6162.489,"The reason it's growing is because local folks are not prepared to be able to obtain those jobs that are growing, knowledge jobs.",177,,
1008,0.97,6162.489,6173.567,So the number one thing we can do to prevent future growth as the economy continues to evolve is investing in education and workforce training for local people.,177,,
1009,0.97,6173.567,6178.071,So they can benefit from the economic growth and not be left behind.,177,,
1010,0.97,6178.071,6185.712,"From that standpoint, one of the things that arts and other departments were working on is acknowledging that the economy is evolving.",177,,
1011,0.97,6185.712,6192.853,"We want to stay ahead of the curve this time instead of reacting because by that time, it's just too late.",177,,
1012,0.97,6192.853,6197.157,Creative economy has grown significantly here in Seattle.,177,,
1013,0.97,6197.157,6199.026,The job growth has gone up 25%.,177,,
1014,0.97,6199.026,6213.44,"But on top of that, the creative economy has grown twice as fast as the average of the other occupations.",177,,
1015,0.97,6213.44,6219.513,Way want to make sure local folks can obtain those jobs and especially from Underserved communities.,177,,
1016,0.97,6219.513,6220.647,"Randy, you want to take it?",177,,
1017,0.97,6220.647,6224.918,Can you give an example of the creative jobs we're talking about here?,178,,
1018,0.97,6224.918,6234.861,"What we know from the study Oed did during 2018, early 2019 is there's really two areas of those jobs.",179,,
1019,0.97,6234.861,6243.904,"There's an enormous amount of performing arts, non-profit, gig worker jobs that aren't compensated at a very competitive rate relative to the rest of the community.",179,,
1020,0.97,6243.904,6254.014,"Then there's a number of creative jobs in the Tech sector, streaming, publishing, Digital production, gaming that pay really well.",179,,
1021,0.97,6254.014,6259.219,"Actually, the best jobs in the country in Seattle and the highest number of them.",179,,
1022,0.97,6259.219,6261.455,They're dramatically over represented by white men.,179,,
1023,0.97,6261.455,6266.994,How do we create more paths to those jobs for more of the people who live in this city?,179,,
1024,0.97,6266.994,6272.499,We have a robust economy in Seattle today that most of the folks who lived here weren't able to benefit the from.,179,,
1025,0.97,6272.499,6278.572,Folks from other places had to move here to fill the jobs in the economy we have.,179,,
1026,0.97,6278.572,6284.077,How do we prepare the young people and the young people of color that live here to benefit from the economy that's growing?,179,,
1027,0.97,6284.077,6305.165,"And I think there's an additional part of it that we and arts and culture feel a responsibility to is independent musicians and actors and performers, how do we create reverence and better compensate them for their time?",179,,
1028,0.97,6305.165,6315.208,"The jobs that aren't going to be automated, that aren't going to be replaced by artificial intelligence and the rise of 5G technology are creative, empathy driven story telling job.",179,,
1029,0.97,6315.208,6317.844,We have to value them at a living wage.,179,,
1030,0.97,6317.844,6328.755,We have to prepare people for the jobs that are increasingly are a living wage and from closing in on both of those angles is how we can grow prosperity in the community.,179,,
1031,0.97,6328.755,6331.258,I have a follow-up question.,180,,
1032,0.97,6331.258,6331.725,Sure.,181,,
1033,0.97,6331.725,6338.465,So this is related to both Randy and Bobby's comments just now.,182,,
1034,0.97,6338.465,6351.778,"To what extent do we work as an office of economic development, for that matter office of arts and culture, in kind of aligning our perceptions of the future demand and like the creative economy?",182,,
1035,0.97,6351.778,6359.686,"Or for that matter, any economic field and our level of interaction with the University of Washington?",182,,
1036,0.97,6359.686,6368.595,"To Randy's point, one of the most pressing things Randy just said is we produce a lot of great jobs for people who don't live here.",182,,
1037,0.97,6368.595,6370.297,That's what we're good at.,183,,
1038,0.97,6370.297,6381.808,"I agree, the gap is how do we develop and give opportunities for our local work force to G fill the demand for the jobs that companies and communities are creating here?",184,,
1039,0.97,6381.808,6387.28,"University of Washington a great Incubator, created to develop and train work force.",184,,
1040,0.97,6387.28,6398.425,I wonder what extent our efforts are integrated with the programs offered at the University of Washington and how much collaboration there is.,184,,
1041,0.97,6398.425,6406.266,"The simplest way to explain is the knowledge economy, we promote stem.",185,,
1042,0.97,6406.266,6414.975,"And the next economy what we have to promote is the creative sometime, which is steam where you have the a, the art part of it.",185,,
1043,0.97,6414.975,6417.344,It's not that technology is not going to go away.,185,,
1044,0.97,6417.344,6424.417,Technology is simply a tool for the creative mind in the next economy because of ai and other tools coming in play.,185,,
1045,0.97,6424.417,6428.421,"What we're working on in our world, we call it a cluster strategy.",185,,
1046,0.97,6428.421,6431.925,A lot of my friends don't like that word.,185,,
1047,0.97,6431.925,6449.943,"It's a creative cluster strategy where we work not just with government partners but with schools, with education, and also industries and collectively build one plan around how to get it more inclusive and scaled over time.",185,,
1048,0.97,6449.943,6452.946,We can't build this strategy without higher education.,185,,
1049,0.97,6452.946,6467.36,"I would just add after Oed did their report, we partnered to do a follow-up report that was about specifically exploring the intersection of racial inequity and the economy.",186,,
1050,0.97,6467.36,6474.901,Why do we have this disparity where we have two different economies?,186,,
1051,0.97,6474.901,6480.64,I think U-Dub has to be a partner in that.,186,,
1052,0.97,6480.64,6484.01,I think it's just the Siloed nature of government.,186,,
1053,0.97,6484.01,6486.413,Where I don't think it's even intentional or malicious.,186,,
1054,0.97,6486.413,6494.187,We all work really hard with our head down in the Lane we're in and people may not realize where there's opportunities to collaborate.,186,,
1055,0.97,6494.187,6500.727,"Looking at the the departments around this table, I think we've done a good job of trying to open that aperture.",186,,
1056,0.97,6500.727,6514.341,I'm thinking about the sub cabinet everyone on this table is a part of where we're Triology to look together how to hold up each other's work.,186,,
1057,0.97,6514.341,6517.41,What does it mean for the six other programs and the foster school?,186,,
1058,0.97,6517.41,6520.046,I think it's a great question.,186,,
1059,0.97,6520.046,6524.05,I do respect the cluster approach Bobby's taken.,186,,
1060,0.97,6524.05,6529.689,That it's trying to bring attendant partners to the table so we're collectively trying to set a target for our success.,186,,
1061,0.97,6529.689,6535.762,"I wanted to add, I know you have a question around what tools might be available.",187,,
1062,0.97,6535.762,6547.007,"Just to sort of reiterate the racial equity lab that our office will be developing, U- Dub is going to be one of the partners we work with.",187,,
1063,0.97,6547.007,6558.618,We do see it becoming a really critical tool for all kinds of analysis for Decisioner makers that would have an impact on all of these programs.,187,,
1064,0.97,6558.618,6566.159,I want to add to the other conversation going on around community wealth.,188,,
1065,0.97,6566.159,6569.963,Jobs are important and the right types of jobs are critical.,188,,
1066,0.97,6569.963,6572.899,There's a land use component as well.,188,,
1067,0.97,6572.899,6582.809,"That's what I eluded to in my earlier presentation and why some of the maps we looked at, especially the historic maps, have relevance today.",188,,
1068,0.97,6582.809,6593.286,"If you haven't read the color of law, I really strongly encourage you to read that.",188,,
1069,0.97,6593.286,6608.068,"The research around the history of zoning, very specifically government sanctioned both Federal and local governments, policies from the '20s, '30s, the FHA, to local policies.",188,,
1070,0.97,6608.068,6619.679,Very deliberately designed to actually segregate primarily African Americans.,188,,
1071,0.97,6619.679,6638.198,"The FHA asked him to develop 17,000 units of housing with very low tax credit from the Federal Government that the Federal Government's requirement at that time was by Covenant, no African Americans could participate in the program.",188,,
1072,0.97,6638.198,6639.666,They can't be residents or owners.,188,,
1073,0.97,6639.666,6643.103,This is a Federal Government in the '20s and '30s.,188,,
1074,0.97,6643.103,6659.986,"Combine that with some of the Red lining map that I showed that was done, some of it by banks and in some cases Seattle and other cities land use zoning from the '20s and '30s had created that segregation.",188,,
1075,0.97,6659.986,6675.068,"Now if you look at a number of other research, you'll see today African Americans income is around 60% of white Americans on average.",188,,
1076,0.97,6675.068,6679.205,Their wealth is less than 10% of those of whites.,188,,
1077,0.97,6679.205,6688.014,"If you assume everybody works of equal income, you'd assume they're 60% of income of white Americans.",188,,
1078,0.97,6688.014,6694.12,"Their wealth should be close to 60%, but it's not.",188,,
1079,0.97,6694.12,6706.733,And Rothstein makes a direct link between how lack of ownership of homes was a critical contributor if not the most to that change today.,188,,
1080,0.97,6706.733,6723.65,"So white people moved to levy town, owned Properts, and over time those properties were built by very low tax loans appreciated over time.",188,,
1081,0.97,6723.65,6725.285,Their kids inherited those.,188,,
1082,0.97,6725.285,6729.989,Land is a critical component of building wealth.,188,,
1083,0.97,6729.989,6733.66,Whether you use it for commercial or residential.,188,,
1084,0.97,6733.66,6737.13,"So he makes the link, that is an important impediment.",188,,
1085,0.97,6737.13,6746.172,"When I talk about, you know, some of the things that we need to look at geographically, it is really tied to land use policies.",188,,
1086,0.97,6746.172,6757.117,"And part of the success so far, very incremental of this initiative, some of it is tied to ownership.",188,,
1087,0.97,6757.117,6768.261,Whether it's land acquisition or the businesses that these communities try to have ownership for is a critical step in real Hi addressing that issue.,188,,
1088,0.97,6768.261,6776.302,And Ubax can talk about some examples of really real world in the last two years that relate to that kind of ownership.,188,,
1089,0.97,6776.302,6784.911,I'm glad that Sam brought up the issue of one of the only ways to build wealth has been through homeownership.,189,,
1090,0.97,6784.911,6789.749,"But there are also barriers we see in communities, like in my community for example.",189,,
1091,0.97,6789.749,6797.957,"Even though we have working class community right now that are professionals, they have other barriers.",189,,
1092,0.97,6797.957,6807.534,"For example, needing a Compliant way of getting homeownership access and things like that.",189,,
1093,0.97,6807.534,6810.57,And then like redefining what that means.,189,,
1094,0.97,6810.57,6822.148,"We have two organizations we're supporting, for example, that they are the spectrum of where they won't even touch an interest.",189,,
1095,0.97,6822.148,6833.226,"I was very impressed with a particular organization called the Cham organization, somebody earlier talked about social capital.",189,,
1096,0.97,6833.226,6844.504,Raise money from the community because they couldn't go to the Bank and were able to buy five properties just from 3000 families that included kids.,189,,
1097,0.97,6844.504,6844.771,Wow.,190,,
1098,0.97,6844.771,6856.816,"And Edi was just a last kind of funding last year that was able to, like, first of all look at, we look at balance sheet from how the banks define it.",191,,
1099,0.97,6856.816,6861.654,But defining that and looking at other vehicles of community ownership and things like that.,191,,
1100,0.97,6861.654,6869.996,The other thing I wanted to bring up about the barriers is also like we talked about government being Siloed.,191,,
1101,0.97,6869.996,6873.8,But government has some strengths and things that we can really move.,191,,
1102,0.97,6873.8,6877.27,What about partnership with community?,191,,
1103,0.97,6877.27,6881.374,What about partnership with Philanthropy?,191,,
1104,0.97,6881.374,6898.391,"Partnering with Seattle foundation and the communities of opportunity to figure out how we can, office of economic development especially around commercial Affordability and how as a government we're limited.",191,,
1105,0.97,6898.391,6906.532,But a community development institution can make that happen and how do we really partner with those groups?,191,,
1106,0.97,6906.532,6915.108,We continue to partner with groups like the Seattle foundation to figure out how we can solve that issue.,191,,
1107,0.97,6915.108,6926.252,"And then the other piece I've been looking at right now is the Boston project, which is a community investment vehicle that is solving some of these issues.",191,,
1108,0.97,6926.252,6935.261,"One of the things that I have heard about for years now is the issue of the ground floor development, right?",192,,
1109,0.97,6935.261,6944.47,"So we have all these projects that might have office of housing money ready to go, but we don't have a way to finance the ground floor.",192,,
1110,0.97,6944.47,6956.349,"Because of the prohibition on Gifting public funds for a particular business or any commercial anything, these projects are shovel ready but can't move forward.",192,,
1111,0.97,6956.349,6959.218,And so that's my understanding.,192,,
1112,0.97,6959.218,6969.729,"You know, how do we dig into this question and really start to find the tools that will allow us and maybe it's trying to partner with Philanthropy.",192,,
1113,0.97,6969.729,6975.768,I know there's a Funder's collaborative conversation happening about trying to answer this question.,192,,
1114,0.97,6975.768,6981.708,But I think it's really important for us to figure that piece out.,192,,
1115,0.97,6981.708,6994.087,"If it's not that, if there's some other tool that will allow us to start to steward or allow community to steward their own Landownership, you know, that's the conversation I'd like for us to continue having.",192,,
1116,0.97,6994.087,7002.962,How do we start moving in the direction of identifying some of those tools and really figuring out how do we make it happen?,192,,
1117,0.97,7002.962,7003.229,Yeah.,193,,
1118,0.97,7003.229,7004.964,"If I can interrupt, I agree with you.",193,,
1119,0.97,7004.964,7012.071,That was one of the challenges in terms of our state law or other barriers.,193,,
1120,0.97,7012.071,7019.512,Some of the success with this multiple Department over the Edi lesson is actually asking that question.,193,,
1121,0.97,7019.512,7039.198,"Because we communicate and coordinate our resources, we've been able to fund and tee up projects like the Ethiopian community center or the Filipino community center who we worked with in terms of building capacity so they are ready to apply for office of housing funding.",193,,
1122,0.97,7039.198,7041.768,The Office of housing cannot pay for the ground floor.,193,,
1123,0.97,7041.768,7050.209,So we tee them up and line up and connect the dots with our coordination so that they're ready for office of housing.,193,,
1124,0.97,7050.209,7052.845,And office of housing is at the table as well.,193,,
1125,0.97,7052.845,7058.584,"And those are kind of successful, you know, two projects that address that.",193,,
1126,0.97,7058.584,7064.157,The Mayor has been exploring this and asking us to explore these issues.,193,,
1127,0.97,7064.157,7068.361,We mentioned the strategic land investments idea.,193,,
1128,0.97,7068.361,7073.433,That is specifically trying to address those kinds of issues.,193,,
1129,0.97,7073.433,7077.036,Can we have office of housing fund housing only?,193,,
1130,0.97,7077.036,7078.604,Edi funds the ground floor only?,193,,
1131,0.97,7078.604,7095.054,"Can we look at new tools that really is flexible, agile so you have as a pilot that then you can address mixed income and Mixed-Use developments that can also leverage other things in the private sector?",193,,
1132,0.97,7095.054,7105.431,Those are the things that are really exciting this year and next year in addition to our focus on industrial lands to really connect a lot of the dots.,193,,
1133,0.97,7105.431,7112.839,I want to put Bobby and Randy on the spot and say the TI program that your office piloted is innovative.,194,,
1134,0.97,7112.839,7115.675,Maybe talking a little bit about that and then the PDA.,194,,
1135,0.97,7115.675,7119.412,We'll end it up with PDA.,195,,
1136,0.97,7119.412,7124.951,"Before I moved to Seattle, I was a sponsor of the affordable commercial space in Portland.",195,,
1137,0.97,7124.951,7143.503,"What we did is we purchased land, build a building, sell the building, master lease back the first floor, and then build out the gray Shell the warm Shell and the TI based on the businesses that could be moving in.",195,,
1138,0.97,7143.503,7148.741,We're targeting African American businesses that were displaced.,195,,
1139,0.97,7148.741,7151.511,It's in North and northeast Portland.,195,,
1140,0.97,7151.511,7159.552,"Government played a role in playing for TI to provide operating funds, capital working dollars.",195,,
1141,0.97,7159.552,7164.223,10-year lease with five additional years for an additional lease because wealth creation takes time.,195,,
1142,0.97,7164.223,7167.293,You can't do it in two years.,195,,
1143,0.97,7167.293,7170.129,It takes 10 years.,195,,
1144,0.97,7170.129,7178.804,"We provide working capital, 10- year lease, and we use a community process to determine who's best qualified for those spaces.",195,,
1145,0.97,7178.804,7182.508,It's not just a random process.,195,,
1146,0.97,7182.508,7183.576,It's a community process.,195,,
1147,0.97,7183.576,7185.711,Here we're prevented from doing that because of the state law.,195,,
1148,0.97,7185.711,7193.386,"There might be a way to use Randy's vision around PDA model to master lease some spaces, so I'll turn it over to Randy.",195,,
1149,0.97,7193.386,7200.893,I hear a theme of perhaps talking to our Intergovernmental relations departments.,196,,
1150,0.97,7200.893,7211.938,"And I think the contours of public development authorities are really complicated, and we've been with our shoulder to the wheel to build, refine, and clarify the idea.",197,,
1151,0.97,7211.938,7227.853,"At a high level, the idea that there can be an intermediary, a well capitalized Mission-Driven intermediary that can stand between the real estate market and the community is clearly a need.",197,,
1152,0.97,7227.853,7233.292,We started from a place of our Biased toward cultural space and cultural use.,197,,
1153,0.97,7233.292,7240.266,"Being on the Edi sub cabinet, we looked at these community centered small businesses.",197,,
1154,0.97,7240.266,7257.583,"They talked about commercial Affordability and whether the mechanism for that Capitalizations bonding or impact investing or Philanthropy or some combination, if we can pull a capital stack together and go to office of housing and say what building needs a Ground- floor tenant?",197,,
1155,0.97,7257.583,7270.296,Who are three partners from the Edi pool who fit that community's character and identity?,197,,
1156,0.97,7270.296,7270.997,That's well within our reach.,197,,
1157,0.97,7270.997,7273.332,What were some of the things that limit us?,197,,
1158,0.97,7273.332,7277.27,"I think as government, we are a risk-averse entity.",197,,
1159,0.97,7277.27,7280.873,As we should be with taxpayer dollars.,197,,
1160,0.97,7280.873,7289.882,"I worry if we only use the tools we've been using to get to where we are now, we are only going to Tweak the status quo over time.",197,,
1161,0.97,7289.882,7298.557,What I've seen in seven years in this job is the Affordability crisis just explode and left with a feeling like we don't have adequate tools to respond.,197,,
1162,0.97,7298.557,7301.227,We can't as the arts office respond alone.,197,,
1163,0.97,7301.227,7307.266,We need to do that in partnership with the other folks around this table.,197,,
1164,0.97,7307.266,7319.345,"Whether it's Seattle promise or commercial Affordability or tenant improvement projects, we need to be thoughtful about bringing a number of those things to bear and actually putting them into the world in some way shape or form.",197,,
1165,0.97,7319.345,7326.419,We need to rally around a couple of projects where we can say we're going to put the pieces together and see if it works.,197,,
1166,0.97,7326.419,7330.69,"If it does, maybe we can scale something like that.",197,,
1167,0.97,7330.69,7331.123,Madame chair.,198,,
1168,0.97,7331.123,7331.39,Yes.,199,,
1169,0.97,7331.39,7336.362,So I have to actually go because I have another commitment Unfortunately.,200,,
1170,0.97,7336.362,7341.0,"Since we're not voting on anything, I don't think it will make a difference.",200,,
1171,0.97,7341.0,7341.367,It's fine.,201,,
1172,0.97,7341.367,7345.938,"But in terms of Quorum or what have you, I want to say this is a really great discussion.",202,,
1173,0.97,7345.938,7351.477,What a great first meeting of this Committee.,202,,

1183,0.97,7380.172,7381.774,This is great.,208,,
1184,0.97,7381.774,7383.242,We're hungry for this.,209,,

1186,0.97,7384.21,7397.189,"I'm really excited to have all of you here to have your passion, commitment, and deep work in the community reflected in the things you've identified as the priorities and the things you've already accomplished.",210,,
