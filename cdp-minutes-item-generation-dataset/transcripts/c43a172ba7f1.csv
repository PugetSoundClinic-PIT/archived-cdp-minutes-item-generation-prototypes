721,0.97,5149.277,5153.748,In order to set the city up for the most positive labor bargaining outcomes.,173,,
722,0.97,5153.748,5164.759,"Instead of making cuts on positions, the and amendments for proviso on two months worth of salary for each position that is targeted for reduction.",173,,

724,0.97,5172.267,5185.613,"If it takes longer than that, officers, so that officers can continue to be paid at the bargaining finish, but the proviso format means the city will have those dollars on hand just in case they are needed.",173,,
725,0.97,5185.613,5197.926,"The actions, if approved by the Council, and bargained as described below will result in a reduction of SPD's police force by about 100 officers from the current level of about 1400 officers.",173,,

729,0.97,5218.413,5223.117,Which seemed appropriate given the current travel restrictions and the Mayor's hiring freeze.,173,,

732,0.97,5240.868,5280.074,"The other point I think is really important to make as we are about to take this vote is that, you know, I think that we as a Council and the Mayor's office are in a really unique position to seize upon a moment in this city and in this country, and I am hopeful that we are more aligned in our desire to do that, then has appeared in the last few weeks.",173,,
733,0.97,5280.074,5281.909,The Mayor has been saying that we should be realistic.,173,,
734,0.97,5281.909,5284.912,And that we have been irresponsible for committing to a goal before we have the details.,173,,

736,0.97,5298.159,5305.933,We always have to think beyond what is normally considered realistic and possible.,173,,

739,0.97,5330.358,5347.075,"Over the weekend, there was an editorial that we took a swing and we missed and I think it is really important to think and look at what we have accomplished for the next four and a half months of the budget.",173,,
740,0.97,5347.075,5357.351,"And understand that is our starting point for deliberations for a whole year worth of budget, so it is important to Annualize the value of these four months of costs.",173,,
741,0.97,5357.351,5398.826,"And I think when you do that and you take paper and pencil up to do that math, our actions, now, are significant and noteworthy and also, express a commitment to not disregard public safety, but to recognize that public safety means public safety four for everyone in the community pick public safety must recognize that by asking police officers to do too much, there are two things that go wrong.",173,,
742,0.97,5398.826,5408.302,"One, you send an armed response in some cases, to a situation that does not require an armed response, which is an unsafe situation.",173,,
743,0.97,5408.302,5416.01,"And two, you are reducing the capacity for officers to respond to law enforcement efforts.",173,,
744,0.97,5416.01,5439.734,"So, I am really encouraged by the work that we have done and I am really hopeful for our efforts and implementing the Council's interest in working together with the Mayor's office, and the chief to realize this Pathway for Reimagined public safety for our city.",173,,

960,0.97,7224.05,7249.709,"Okay folks, so I think we are coming close to an end, I will just quickly, before I give the last word over to the chair of our select budget committee, just say that I also, like Council member Morales, want to express my appreciation for all of the legislative Department staff, central staff, legislative Department, I.T.",214,,

964,0.97,7326.519,7330.356,And there are people on the opposite end of the spectrum who believe we need to abolish the police Department.,214,,

967,0.97,7384.11,7390.916,I think that is an important endeavor for us to undertake.,214,,

1146,0.97,9016.841,9022.413,We have spent a lot of time passing of important details with the help of our central staff and our legislative staff.,226,,
1147,0.97,9022.413,9025.015,Sometimes it is easy to lose the forest for the trees.,226,,
1148,0.97,9025.015,9027.418,Which is why this resolution is so important.,226,,
1149,0.97,9027.418,9033.758,This is our opportunity to begin to lay out counsel's vision for what true community safety can look like in Seattle.,226,,
1150,0.97,9033.758,9040.765,With this resolution . counsel is starting to define our ideas informed by our constituents.,226,,
1151,0.97,9040.765,9043.868,By advocates community and activist and yes even the Mayor's office.,226,,
1152,0.97,9043.868,9048.272,And the police Department.,226,,
1153,0.97,9048.272,9058.215,"This resolution itself, does not transfer services to a civilian led Department.",226,,
1154,0.97,9058.215,9060.684,But it says it is our goal and that really matters.,226,,
1155,0.97,9060.684,9064.388,These community members a way to hold us accountable for their continued progress that they are insisting on.,226,,
1156,0.97,9064.388,9068.959,And if I say executive into for the conversation with the Council on the path forward to realize this vision.,226,,
1157,0.97,9068.959,9070.394,The resolution contains specific actionable changes.,226,,
1158,0.97,9070.394,9077.902,We have talked twice about the content of those changes already today.,226,,
1159,0.97,9077.902,9079.804,I am not going to go over the began.,226,,
1160,0.97,9079.804,9082.273,But I am going to say that they are profound changes.,226,,
1161,0.97,9082.273,9084.608,That is not about congratulating ourselves that we have encompassed a mission.,226,,
1162,0.97,9084.608,9086.41,That is still way far off.,226,,
1163,0.97,9086.41,9088.913,And there are many votes ahead of us.,226,,
1164,0.97,9088.913,9092.316,To mark the moment at which the Council begins the journey.,226,,
1165,0.97,9092.316,9111.202,A poll that was taken between July 22 and July 27 found that 53% of likely voters supported the general idea of a plan that will permanently cut the police Department's budget by 50% and shift that money to social services and Community-Based programs.,226,,
1166,0.97,9111.202,9128.152,32% expressed support for what was described as the Council's approach . ostensibly made an immediate 50% cut . 43% expressed support for what was described as the Mayor's approach which was a cut with a plan.,226,,
1167,0.97,9128.152,9142.366,"We have before us a day, a budget of the resolution, that when SP because our annualized and transfers accomplished in 2021, represents a plan forward.",226,,
1168,0.97,9142.366,9146.07,"For our future decisions, for a goal that a majority of the other residents support.",226,,
1169,0.97,9146.07,9147.404,"Again, this is a starting point.",226,,
1170,0.97,9147.404,9150.374,And of course there is much more work to be done to realize his vision.,226,,
1171,0.97,9150.374,9156.08,"Starting in just a handful of weeks when the Council begins it's all budget process, looking at the 2021 budget.",226,,
1172,0.97,9156.08,9161.752,Our work is far from nine.,226,,
1173,0.97,9161.752,9163.754,With our vote today we start the journey.,226,,
1174,0.97,9163.754,9170.094,I want to thank the incredibly detailed and thoughtful work of Decriminalize Seattle and King Cagle King County equity not whose ideas have informed this resolution.,226,,
1175,0.97,9170.094,9175.799,Much of my work on the 2020 budget rebalancing.,226,,
1176,0.97,9175.799,9187.478,"And I want to thank the tens of thousands of people who have written him a call, provided comment and marched tirelessly and at times a great personal risk to keep the pressure on us.",226,,
1177,0.97,9187.478,9188.712,Thank you.,226,,
1178,0.97,9188.712,9192.783,Thank you Councilmember Herboldt.,227,,
1179,0.97,9192.783,9198.689,Are there any other comments on the resolution?,227,,
1180,0.97,9198.689,9208.332,Councilmember Sawant,227,,
1181,0.97,9208.332,9214.605,Thank you as I mentioned earlier today I will be voting yes on this resolution stating the Council's intent and hopes to defend the police in the future.,228,,
1182,0.97,9214.605,9224.014,"However, we have to be clear that a nonbinding resolution stating the intent to hope to study the Defunding of the police in the future is simply not a substitute for actually defending the police.",228,,
1183,0.97,9224.014,9228.452,Our movement is clearly expected to accept these mice was about the future intentions as accomplished.,228,,
1184,0.97,9228.452,9239.463,"But Unfortunately, I believe that there will be a series mistake as we have seen over and over again.",228,,
1185,0.97,9239.463,9246.136,"In Minneapolis, the Democratic party led city council promised to change the city charter charter and totally reorganize the lease Department.",228,,
1186,0.97,9246.136,9253.41,"As they predicted rather than taking action as the city's highest legislative body, the Minneapolis city council particular question to the charter Commission.",228,,
1187,0.97,9253.41,9260.884,Again the charter Commission has said this is not possible.,228,,
1188,0.97,9260.884,9265.489,"So after all the pomp and circumstance of Defunding promises, the Minneapolis Democrats are not Defunding the police.",228,,
1189,0.97,9265.489,9285.275,"Here in Seattle, three weeks ago, after my office and pledged to fight to defend the police by at least 50%, six Democrats on the Council also promised 2% Defunding today they voted to reduce it by less than $3 million and then added $3 million to the police budget through the second quarter supplemental budget.",228,,
1190,0.97,9285.275,9291.482,Lastly the proposed Defunding the police by 50% now.,228,,
1191,0.97,9291.482,9292.616,Every other Councilmember voted no.,228,,
1192,0.97,9292.616,9300.324,Saying the budget cuts cannot be done until November.,228,,
1193,0.97,9300.324,9304.928,And then I proposed Defunding the police by 50% starting November 1. no other Councilman would even second the proposal.,228,,
1194,0.97,9304.928,9307.331,"To be clear, Defunding the police cannot be an accounting trick.",228,,
1195,0.97,9307.331,9310.401,Moving traffic and parking enforcement out of the Seattle police Department.,228,,
1196,0.97,9310.401,9316.54,But keep the keeping it unchanged is not with the movement made by Defunding the police.,228,,
1197,0.97,9316.54,9321.245,By Defunding the police we need to in the person of our communities.,228,,
1198,0.97,9321.245,9335.459,"I want to point out that the resolution States, Section 7 the city council will not support any budget amendments to increase the budget to offset overtime, expenditures above the funds budgeted in 2020 or 2021.",228,,
1199,0.97,9335.459,9345.769,"But in practice, the same day this counsel is making this promise to this resolution, the majority which is seven of the eight Councilmember's presence also voted to pass agenda items number one.",228,,
1200,0.97,9345.769,9357.347,"The second quarter of the budget was at 1.11, $1.3 million to the police Department for among other things overtime.",228,,
1201,0.97,9357.347,9365.656,This is a small thing in a large bill that includes many of the budget changes that are not objectionable.,228,,
1202,0.97,9365.656,9368.559,But it is often the only way these binders can be violated.,228,,
1203,0.97,9368.559,9379.436,And I raise this example to illustrate the point that the city council is to be held accountable for what they actually do.,228,,
1204,0.97,9379.436,9380.604,Not for the promises they make.,228,,
1205,0.97,9380.604,9387.811,And today with the Council has done is fail to define the police.,228,,
1206,0.97,9387.811,9391.615,"Again as I said, I will vote yes because I fully support the intention of the resolution.",228,,
1207,0.97,9391.615,9398.722,"But at the end of the day, generally Defunding the police and the police to him into Buckley's violent that is independently organized.",228,,
1208,0.97,9398.722,9402.025,Thank you.,228,,
1209,0.97,9402.025,9403.327,Thank you colleagues.,229,,
1210,0.97,9403.327,9408.599,"Any other questions, excuse me any other comments on the resolution?",229,,

1224,0.97,9477.1,9478.602,The previous item was no item 12.,230,,

1231,0.97,9526.049,9536.86,The idea is that we need much better formation and alignment of efforts across various Workgroups and initiatives . and different structures that have been set up over time by the city.,232,,
1232,0.97,9536.86,9552.776,"As I mentioned this morning, the goal here is to eliminate some of the deposit of work that is happening as the different initiatives seek to engage community . to get input from community.",232,,
1233,0.97,9552.776,9566.89,There is certainly a lot of interest from community members and participating in engagement in surveys and sharing their expertise and knowledge about what community wants is a relates to how our legal system works or doesn't work.,232,,
1234,0.97,9566.89,9579.303,"But because there are so many different things happening, it is really burdensome on community to be asked to repeatedly participate in these.",232,,
1235,0.97,9579.303,9582.072,So that is part of the goal.,232,,
1236,0.97,9582.072,9590.714,Is to ensure that these multiple requests for engagement and survey are better aligned and better coordinated.,232,,
1237,0.97,9590.714,9608.932,And just to move the work forward in a much more coordinated way as we think about how to make investments in our city and in the work that the office of civil rights on the parts of the city are doing for community safety.,232,,

1430,0.97,10683.305,10688.144,This is very important to me because I am passionate about the crucial role that a free place press plays another democracy.,259,,
1431,0.97,10688.144,10697.286,We must always protect journalists including those who cover protests and demonstrations so they can shine a light on the true providing accurate and independent reports.,259,,
1432,0.97,10697.286,10704.126,Social media posts in government issue reports are not a substitute for professional journalists.,259,,

1434,0.97,10712.802,10714.403,Thank you.,259,,

1437,0.97,10720.342,10728.05,Thank you I want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for bringing this forward back on July 10.,261,,
1438,0.97,10728.05,10729.819,I guess that is a month ago today.,261,,
1439,0.97,10729.819,10739.428,I wrote to the Mayor in chief regarding the arrest of a journalist Andrew of the defendant.,261,,
1440,0.97,10739.428,10741.03,And the threat of arrest about a journalist.,261,,
1441,0.97,10741.03,10759.882,"I have not yet received a reply . and as a reminder, it is really important to recognize that the municipal code in the police Department's policy as it relates to orders to disperse . specifically journalist.",261,,
1442,0.97,10759.882,10768.357,"Never the less, since then journalists are still reporting having chemical irritants or projectiles used on them.",261,,
1443,0.97,10768.357,10773.329,"And not just reporting it, I viewed it on live stream.",261,,
1444,0.97,10773.329,10778.4,Including Salsberry of Convergent media.,261,,
1445,0.97,10778.4,10783.572,And his threat of arrest was for the letter earlier.,261,,
1446,0.97,10783.572,10791.514,Using these devices on journalists has in effect the same impact as that of arrest.,261,,
1447,0.97,10791.514,10796.919,It results in journalist being unable to cover the events that they are there to report on.,261,,
1448,0.97,10796.919,10798.721,And thereby inform the public.,261,,
1449,0.97,10798.721,10811.734,The operation of the free press is a linchpin of American democracy . Thank you.,261,,

1455,0.97,10830.719,10834.857,Of course the same goes for legal legal observers and medics.,263,,
1456,0.97,10834.857,10840.763,I would add that this is a resolution that means that it does not have the force of the law.,263,,
1457,0.97,10840.763,10846.235,"Even if it were in orders for the force of the law, we have seen what happened with the police Department especially under Mayor Durkan's authority.",263,,
1458,0.97,10846.235,10856.679,We would need to remember the laws of Seattle have already prohibited police officer from targeting journalists but it still goes on.,263,,
1459,0.97,10856.679,10862.751,Which means the resolution will be insufficient to demand to defend the freedom of the press in Seattle.,263,,
1460,0.97,10862.751,10866.655,But it is still important for the Council to pass this resolution.,263,,
1461,0.97,10866.655,10879.401,"And because this is our final police Department related item, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank the members of the city council for their help in preparing the budget amendments.",263,,

1483,0.97,11029.151,11031.854,Unfortunately we have seen very similar tactics used in other cities as well.,264,,
1484,0.97,11031.854,11044.733,"One element that I would like to lift up from ruling today, says described by the Ninth circuit, when wrongdoing is underway, officials have a great incentive to be blindfolded, to Blindfold though watchful eyes of the fourth estate.",264,,

1605,0.97,11585.106,11593.448,Local media outlets have said the ruling that we have seen from the local court that will require them to turn over photos and videos taken a protest threatens journalists roles.,285,,

1669,0.97,12029.25,12031.019,I guess that is a month ago today.,289,,
1670,0.97,12031.019,12040.628,I wrote to the Mayor in chief regarding the arrest of a journalist Andrew of the defendant.,289,,
1671,0.97,12040.628,12042.23,And the threat of arrest about a journalist.,289,,
1672,0.97,12042.23,12061.082,"I have not yet received a reply . and as a reminder, it is really important to recognize that the municipal code in the police Department's policy as it relates to orders to disperse . specifically journalist.",289,,
1673,0.97,12061.082,12069.557,"Never the less, since then journalists are still reporting having chemical irritants or projectiles used on them.",289,,
1674,0.97,12069.557,12074.529,"And not just reporting it, I viewed it on live stream.",289,,

1676,0.97,12079.6,12084.772,And his threat of arrest was for the letter earlier.,289,,
1677,0.97,12084.772,12092.713,Using these devices on journalists has in effect the same impact as that of arrest.,289,,
1678,0.97,12092.713,12098.119,It results in journalist being unable to cover the events that they are there to report on.,289,,
1679,0.97,12098.119,12099.921,And thereby inform the public.,289,,
1680,0.97,12099.921,12112.934,The operation of the free press is a linchpin of American democracy . Thank you.,289,,

1685,0.97,12123.945,12131.919,"Opposing police officers targeting journalists, arresting and abusing the and demanding that they turnover the video.",291,,
1686,0.97,12131.919,12136.057,Of course the same goes for legal legal observers and medics.,291,,
1687,0.97,12136.057,12141.963,I would add that this is a resolution that means that it does not have the force of the law.,291,,
1688,0.97,12141.963,12147.435,"Even if it were in orders for the force of the law, we have seen what happened with the police Department especially under Mayor Durkan's authority.",291,,
1689,0.97,12147.435,12157.879,We would need to remember the laws of Seattle have already prohibited police officer from targeting journalists but it still goes on.,291,,
1690,0.97,12157.879,12163.951,Which means the resolution will be insufficient to demand to defend the freedom of the press in Seattle.,291,,
1691,0.97,12163.951,12167.855,But it is still important for the Council to pass this resolution.,291,,
1692,0.97,12167.855,12180.601,"And because this is our final police Department related item, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank the members of the city council for their help in preparing the budget amendments.",291,,

1703,0.97,12250.871,12258.479,I also wanted to quickly publicly thank all Socialist community organizers in my office.,291,,
1704,0.97,12258.479,12274.862,"Jonathan Rosenblum, Sasha Sommer, Nick Jones and Adams and Kolsky who have done exemplary and self-sacrificing work and Needless to say, thanks to the hundreds if not thousands of people who have given of themselves in this fight . The fight will go on.",291,,

1713,0.97,12316.837,12330.351,Councilmembers out of Portland Oregon three weeks ago unanimously passed a similar resolution . so that we could really build on that across his region.,292,,
1714,0.97,12330.351,12333.054,Unfortunately we have seen very similar tactics used in other cities as well.,292,,
1715,0.97,12333.054,12345.933,"One element that I would like to lift up from ruling today, says described by the Ninth circuit, when wrongdoing is underway, officials have a great incentive to be blindfolded, to Blindfold though watchful eyes of the fourth estate.",292,,
1716,0.97,12345.933,12364.585,"When the government announces it is excluding the press for reasons such as administrative committees, preservation of evidence, or protection of reporter safety, it is its real motive may be to prevent the gathering of information on government abuses or incompetence.",292,,
