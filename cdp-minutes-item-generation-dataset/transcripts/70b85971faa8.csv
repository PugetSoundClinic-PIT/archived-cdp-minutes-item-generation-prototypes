77,0.97,480.646,501.801,"Agenda item 1, an ordinance relating to the 2018 families, education, preschool, and promise levy amending the levy implementation and evaluation plan adopted by ordinance 125807 and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts for briefing, discussion, and possible vote.",22,,
78,0.97,501.801,531.097,"Colleagues, as I said at the last meeting, we heard from Deel . I asked Brian to be here just to give us a quick review of the amendments--of the policy changes and we have one technical amendment as well, so I do plan to vote on this today and I wanted to give us another chance for questions and discussion.",23,,
79,0.97,531.097,535.701,"Brian, I will hand it off to you to get us going.",23,,
80,0.97,535.701,541.407,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",24,,
81,0.97,541.407,566.165,"As you indicated earlier, this item was discussed in detail on August 12th, so I will take a few moments to summarize the policy changes proposed in the bill and we will describe the technical amendment . The bill proposes to make six policy changes to the families, education, preschool, and promise implementation plan.",24,,
82,0.97,566.165,590.59,The plan was approved by the Council in April of 2019 after voters had approved the proposition in November of 2018 and it provides a substantial amount of detail with respect to the four investment areas and describes the strategies to be funded within each area.,24,,
83,0.97,590.59,592.591,This has been amended by Council three times previously.,24,,
84,0.97,592.591,597.196,"All were Addendum's in response to the pandemic and at this time, all Addendum's have expired or are no longer in effect.",24,,
85,0.97,597.196,610.843,"If you would like more detail on the proposed policy changes that I will discuss or the--if you would like to know the Ie plan, there is a central staff memo attached to the agenda that includes that level of detail.",24,,
86,0.97,610.843,628.427,"The first item would provide the Department of education and early learning the ability to make policy modifications to the Seattle preschool program, Spp, to align with similar County, state, and Childcare programs.",24,,
87,0.97,628.427,635.835,"Along with this authority, Deel will be required to write a 60 day notice to the Council prior to taking effect.",24,,
88,0.97,635.835,647.013,"Second, it would allow Deel to calculate free tuition thresholds and the tuition sliding scale.",24,,
89,0.97,647.013,660.059,"Changes are requested to align with the child care assistance program and the States early childhood and education system program, known as Eceap.",24,,
90,0.97,660.059,665.865,"Rather than specifying state medium income, however, the changes would allow Deel flexibility.",24,,
91,0.97,665.865,678.878,"Third, the changes would allow certain children who turn three years old after the programs August 31st deadline to enroll into Spp on their third birthday.",24,,
92,0.97,678.878,689.255,Children would be eligible if they are Transitioning from early Eceap into an Spp classroom or if they have an individualized education plan.,24,,
93,0.97,689.255,704.67,The fourth policy change would modify the Ie plan to recognize Deel has the authority to extend Spp into the summer months rather than operating the program during the typical school year calendar.,24,,
94,0.97,704.67,713.279,Deel began offering the option to provide a programming into the summer months in spring of 2021 and continued into summer of 2022.,24,,
95,0.97,713.279,740.439,"The fifth set of changes would update an evaluation Timeline Table 2 reflect the delays that Deel has experienced during the pandemic . and finally, the six policy change would expand the levy funds in the homelessness and housing support services category to include activities outside a Útypical housing related cost, such as nutrition, clothing, and transportation expenses.",24,,
96,0.97,740.439,743.876,And the last thing I will describe this morning as the potential technical amendment listed on the agenda.,24,,
97,0.97,743.876,748.614,I will bring that up on my screen right now for you.,24,,
98,0.97,748.614,755.087,"So, the amendment is listed as amendment one, version 1. it is sponsored by Councilmember Morales.",24,,
99,0.97,755.087,766.465,The amendment would correct Oversights in the initial drafting of the bill and the changes are consistent with the intent of the policy changes that I just described.,24,,
100,0.97,766.465,782.681,Specifically the amendment would make two small changes on page 35 of the Ie plan other than the Federal poverty level and strike one sentence on page 47 that refers to Spp is only offered during the school year.,24,,
101,0.97,782.681,787.319,"If the committee finds the proposed changes in the bill to be acceptable, I would recommend adoption to keep the plan consistent internally.",24,,
102,0.97,787.319,790.789,I am happy to answer any questions that you all might have.,24,,
103,0.97,790.789,795.261,"Great . Thanks so much, Brian.",25,,
104,0.97,795.261,824.123,"For the record, could you explain one more time, the reason for the amendment is to further address the fact we are changing the Federal poverty--we are going more in alignment with the changes made at the state level for who is eligible to participate . can you talk a little more on why that change is needed?",25,,
105,0.97,824.123,824.59,Sure.,26,,
106,0.97,824.59,829.428,The changes specifically in the technical amendment?,26,,
107,0.97,829.428,829.995,Yeah.,27,,
108,0.97,829.995,839.605,"Well, so simply the Ie plan is very specific in terms of what Deel is eligible to do.",28,,
109,0.97,839.605,845.411,"When the plan was drafted, it was very specific about the Federal poverty level being the income method.",28,,
110,0.97,845.411,855.321,Anyone at the time who was 350% poverty level or below has free tuition in the program and there is a sliding scale.,28,,
111,0.97,855.321,859.859,"As income increases, their contribution to tuition increases as well.",28,,
112,0.97,859.859,870.269,"Since that was adopted, the education and assistance program and the city's Childcare program have switched their income Metrics.",28,,
113,0.97,870.269,874.273,"Instead of relying on the Federal poverty level, they have switched to the state median income.",28,,
114,0.97,874.273,889.555,"The changes to switch to state median income, Deel has tried to align them very closely, so the same types of families are receiving the same types of services and will pay the same tuition but it is simply switching the Metrics.",28,,
115,0.97,889.555,897.263,"If for some reason they choose another metric in the future, they can switch to that as well without having to come to Council.",28,,
116,0.97,897.263,917.549,"Part of the rationale is our cost of living here in Washington state is significantly different from other states . If we are going by the Federal guideline, that could cause a real imbalance in the students eligible for this service, is that right?",29,,
117,0.97,917.549,922.254,It is a better indicator for families living in our area.,30,,
118,0.97,922.254,923.055,"Okay, thank you.",31,,
119,0.97,923.055,927.126,"Colleagues, any questions about the underlying legislation or the amendment itself?",31,,
120,0.97,927.126,928.527,I have one.,32,,

122,0.97,931.297,935.334,Thank you for that Synopsis.,34,,
123,0.97,935.334,938.771,It's been a while since we first heard this presentation.,34,,
124,0.97,938.771,965.965,"For the modification to the Seattle preschool plan program eligibility, I support this and I do support the underlying legislation . I am curious, allowing a child to enroll shortly after their third birthday, is there an estimate of how many more children will be able to participate based on this change?",34,,
125,0.97,965.965,966.932,"Yes, there is.",35,,
126,0.97,966.932,982.781,"Deel estimates approximately 10 children would have benefited, so it is not that many, which is why Deel thinks it is an equitable change to make . The program wouldn't impose significant enrollment or financial implications for the program.",35,,
127,0.97,982.781,987.653,Got it . Thanks so much.,36,,
128,0.97,987.653,992.458,"Any other questions, colleagues?",37,,
129,0.97,992.458,997.229,Councilmember Strauss?,37,,
130,0.97,997.229,998.03,"Thank you, chair.",38,,

132,0.97,1000.065,1004.703,This was really helpful in understanding . Thank you.,38,,
133,0.97,1004.703,1010.843,"In that case, I will move the amendment first.",39,,
134,0.97,1010.843,1018.117,I moved to amend a Council bill 120398 as presented on the proposed amendment 1.,39,,

136,0.97,1018.417,1019.351,Thank you.,41,,
137,0.97,1019.351,1044.209,"As Brian said, the amendment would make two additional changes to include and fully implement the policy changes that have been proposed by the executive and just to correct Oversights in the drafting . So, if there are no other comments or questions, will the clerk please call the roll on the amendment?",41,,
138,0.97,1044.209,1047.312,Councilmember Lewis?,42,,
