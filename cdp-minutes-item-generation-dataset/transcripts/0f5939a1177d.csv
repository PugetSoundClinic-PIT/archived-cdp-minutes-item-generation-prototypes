43,0.97,245.645,250.45,I'm here to talk about vision zero.,10,,
44,0.97,250.45,253.386,I'm a Columbia city Baker resident.,10,,
45,0.97,253.386,282.081,"I ride my E-Bike everywhere rain or shine, and I cannot tell you how many conversations I have had with friends, coworkers, and random strangers who came up to talk to me about my E-Bike about Cycling in Seattle, and I tell them cycle every day is good for their health, and it's more fun to cycle than sit in traffic, and it's good for the environment to take the cars off the street, but the one thing that always, always, always holds them back is safety.",10,,
46,0.97,282.081,287.387,"I can't lie and say, you know,--it's very scary to ride in Seattle every single day.",10,,
47,0.97,287.387,299.232,You have to have an aggressive Tempterment.,10,,
48,0.97,299.232,320.086,"There's people interested in driving less and Cycling more, but I have to warn them about the dangers after an experienced cyclist riding on popular route was killed in broad daylight a mile from my house.",10,,
49,0.97,320.086,321.821,I urge you to fund vision zero.,10,,
50,0.97,321.821,324.891,"To many people want to cycle, but they are afraid to.",10,,
51,0.97,324.891,332.932,"Please, when I encourage others to cycle in Seattle, I do not want this to feel as I'm potentially signing their death warrant.",10,,
52,0.97,332.932,333.633,Thank you for hearing me out.,10,,
53,0.97,340.74,343.576,Thank you very much.,11,,
54,0.97,343.576,348.414,Next we have Clara followed by Gordon.,12,,
55,0.97,348.414,348.881,"Go ahead, Clara.",12,,
56,0.97,352.185,355.388,"Hello, can you hear me?",13,,
57,0.97,355.388,356.956,Yes.,14,,
58,0.97,356.956,367.867,"Hi, my name is Clara Cantor with Seattle native green ways, and I'm calling in to comment on the vision zero presentation.",15,,
59,0.97,367.867,378.311,I also bike to get around on a daily basis and live in Rainier Valley in district two.,15,,
60,0.97,378.311,389.789,I just wanted to share with the Council that over the last five years district two has had double the number of fatalities of any other district.,15,,
61,0.97,389.789,399.899,"In the last month or two, we have had two memorials for people who were killed while riding bikes on routes that I use regularly.",15,,
62,0.97,399.899,412.678,"The first was Robert nice who was killed down in Georgetown, and the second was Michael Coleman who was Referenced and killed on third Park Avenue.",15,,
63,0.97,412.678,424.123,"These are really places that people bike every single day, and right now they feel really, really unsafe.",15,,
64,0.97,424.123,427.427,There's a lot of investments that can be made.,15,,
65,0.97,427.427,430.229,The vision zero team knows where those investments can be made.,15,,
66,0.97,430.229,432.832,They know the problem areas.,15,,
67,0.97,432.832,444.01,"They know the specific streets that need to be improved and the intersections that need to be improved, and they really need funding in order to get there.",15,,
68,0.97,444.01,456.489,"I'm asking Council to continue the funding from four vision zero past 2021, and increase the funding in an ongoing way that will be really meaningful for people's safety.",15,,
69,0.97,456.489,456.889,Thank you.,15,,
70,0.97,459.859,461.961,"Thank you, Clara.",16,,
71,0.97,461.961,463.362,Next we have Gordon.,16,,
72,0.97,463.362,463.996,"Good morning, Gordon.",16,,
73,0.97,467.2,471.971,"Good morning, council member I'm Gordon Bilford.",17,,
74,0.97,471.971,475.775,I'm grateful that you are all taking on the topic of vision zero.,17,,
75,0.97,475.775,483.149,"As you probably heard, we are not making vision progress to make sure everyone is safely able to travel our streets.",17,,
76,0.97,483.149,488.354,I want to leave you with an analogy to chew on today.,17,,
77,0.97,488.354,509.976,"Back at the Michael Coleman Memorial, I was speaking because he worked at the airport, and many of his colleagues from the King County airport were there, and I said if this were happening in at an airport, if you had 20 people dying at the airport every year and suffering Life-Changing and life-threatening injuries there would be drastic action taken.",17,,
78,0.97,509.976,511.911,It would not be seen as okay.,17,,
79,0.97,511.911,517.049,I think we need the same sort of mentality when thinking of road transportation.,17,,
80,0.97,517.049,530.73,"Just because we have gotten numb to it, and you're used to hearing the traffic report talk about the inconveniences of a crash rather than the human life toll doesn't mean we should be numb to it.",17,,
81,0.97,530.73,534.5,It means we should address the traffic safety challenges head on.,17,,
82,0.97,534.5,541.541,"The city has a good vision zero team and a Data-Driven strategy for addressing the known issues, but they need funding.",17,,
83,0.97,541.541,547.914,"My hope is that this fall during the budget process, you will find a way to adequately fund vision zero.",17,,
84,0.97,547.914,557.323,"There's an opportunity with the vehicle licensing fee, which we talked about, and there may be other opportunities as well to bring the program up to the level it needs to be to make a positive difference for our community.",17,,
85,0.97,557.323,557.69,Thank you.,17,,
86,0.97,563.162,569.869,"Thank you, Gordon.",18,,
87,0.97,569.869,574.874,I'm not seeing any other speakers present.,18,,
88,0.97,574.874,578.644,Do you see Anies?,18,,
89,0.97,578.644,580.346,There's no other public comment registrants.,19,,
90,0.97,580.346,582.348,Thank you for double checking that.,20,,
91,0.97,582.348,593.359,"This concludes the list of speakers from the general public, and now we will move on to the first legislative item on the agenda, the only item, a very important one.",20,,
92,0.97,593.359,593.693,Vision zero.,20,,
93,0.97,593.693,639.438,"We know we have much more work to do to meet Seattle's vision zero goals while crashes in 2020 decreased compared to 2019, the reduction in fatalities was disturbingly minimal considering the decrease in vehicles on the road and considering Sdot's ongoing work to improve traffic safety, projects that can be funded, and Seattle levy as well, and I note that, and even though there are only a few speakers this morning, that's a Testament to the good work Sdot has done to communicate the plan to the different advisory boards.",20,,
94,0.97,639.438,659.658,"I was at the levy oversight committee, and they were complimenting a Speaker we will her presentation . Mplimenting I think she got the word out there to the folks who are really focused on the issues, and now we get to have our own briefing here at this Committee.",20,,
95,0.97,659.658,681.847,"I want to welcome our director of transportation, Sam Zimbabwe and also open it up to Calvin chow, if you had any opening remarks to set the table before we hear from Allison and Jim.",20,,
96,0.97,681.847,683.049,"No, I don't.",21,,
97,0.97,683.049,686.686,"Thank you, Calvin.",22,,
98,0.97,686.686,687.486,"Good morning, director Zimbabwe.",22,,
99,0.97,687.486,687.92,Good morning.,23,,
100,0.97,687.92,697.263,Thank you for having us here to talk about this really critically important conversation and topic.,23,,
101,0.97,697.263,705.104,"We have a presentation we will provide, and then we really look forward to questions and discussions as we go forward.",23,,
102,0.97,705.104,723.489,I'm joined this morning by Allison Schwartz who is the vision zero program manager and Jim curtain who Curtin who is the project director.,23,,
103,0.97,723.489,728.227,We want to remember the people killed and harmed in traffic violence.,23,,
104,0.97,728.227,734.233,Unfortunately this slide that we provided late last week is already out of date.,23,,
105,0.97,734.233,743.976,147 people have been killed in traffic crashes since we launched vision zero six years ago.,23,,
106,0.97,743.976,753.919,"This includes 13 fatalities in 2021, five people walking, three people Biking, one person riding a Moped, two people in motorcycles, and two people in vehicles.",23,,
107,0.97,753.919,764.764,Our team responds to every fatal and serious collision injury report and tries to understand the underlying factors that were involved in that crash.,23,,
108,0.97,764.764,771.403,First responders and Sdot's own incident response team are on the scene of the crashes.,23,,
109,0.97,771.403,779.445,"Spd's collision investigation squad reconstructs the fatal crashes, and family members and friends carry the lifelong grief.",23,,
110,0.97,779.445,784.383,So many layers and levels of trauma occur through these crashes on our city streets.,23,,
111,0.97,784.383,804.003,"While we are presenting a lot of data today, we must also center our discussions on the lives lost and harmed like the one commemorated in the Memorial on this slide, and the ones we have heard about from the public comment.",23,,
112,0.97,804.003,806.972,Vision zero is a Holistic strategy.,23,,
113,0.97,806.972,821.954,It's important for us to recognize just the impacts that all of this has on--that is happening within the Right-Of- way as we continue to advance our traffic safety goals.,23,,
114,0.97,821.954,843.008,"And how, also in line with our recent social justice initiative goals, it's time to daylight the uncomfortable reality, an enforcement approach can lead to financial impact, injury, and death for black and Brown community members across our city and across the country.",23,,
115,0.97,843.008,855.054,"With that, and before I turn it over to Allison to walk through the brief of the presentation, I hope you will join me for a brief moment of silence to remember those lives lost on our streets.",23,,
116,0.97,863.395,867.866,And together we affirm our support for safe and racially equitable streets.,23,,
117,0.97,867.866,871.971,We acknowledge our commitment to end serious fatalities and injuries on our streets.,23,,
118,0.97,871.971,874.506,"With that, we can go to the next slide.",23,,
119,0.97,876.775,886.118,Just a couple of brief Overviewpoints before I turn it over to Allison.,23,,
120,0.97,886.118,893.559,"Fundamentally, street design is critical for how we achieve vision zero.",23,,
121,0.97,893.559,903.602,Our--and our smart Street design also connects to the city's goals around racial equity and Sustainability.,23,,
122,0.97,903.602,908.007,We will discuss that we are not getting closer to vision zero yet.,23,,
123,0.97,908.007,916.081,"There's an opportunity to correct, making use of the engineering tools we have seen work in our city.",23,,
124,0.97,916.081,931.096,We will also talk a little bit about where we see the vision zero efforts going in a way that centers racial equity and looks to address the safety on our streets.,23,,
125,0.97,931.096,934.466,"With that, I will turn it over to, Allison.",23,,
126,0.97,934.466,937.636,"Thank you, Sam.",24,,
127,0.97,937.636,938.203,"Next slide, please.",24,,
128,0.97,938.203,943.542,Thank you Councilmembers for having us here today.,24,,
129,0.97,943.542,949.882,I'm Allison Schwartz along with my team of four staff we lead the charge to end traffic deaths and serious injuries.,24,,
130,0.97,949.882,965.731,"As Sam mentioned, we are already looking at 13 traffic fatalities this year, and I think many people may be wondering what is going on, and specifically, to Council member Peterson's point earlier, what happened in 2020?",24,,
131,0.97,965.731,971.07,Why were there so many traffic deaths despite the drop in traffic and crashes?,24,,
132,0.97,971.07,976.709,There's still definitely many unknowns of how the pandemic has affected human behavior.,24,,
133,0.97,976.709,990.522,"While what we are seeing in Seattle Aligns with national Útrends, we do want to step BAC for a moment and discuss the quote, end quote, normal we have become accustomed to.",24,,
134,0.97,990.522,994.593,Let's look at 2020 in context of the last several years.,24,,
135,0.97,994.593,1000.532,"On average in Seattle 20 people are killed in crashes, and 160 are seriously injured every year.",24,,
136,0.97,1000.532,1008.107,In 2020 we did see that increase to 25 people killed and serious injuries dipped slightly.,24,,
137,0.97,1008.107,1019.985,"This is nested in a broader context of more than 500 traffic deaths a year in Washington State and 40,000 a year in the United States.",24,,
138,0.97,1019.985,1030.596,"We did see lower vehicle volumes and fewer collisions overall, but we believe we are seeing similar outcomes because we are operating in essentially the same system.",24,,
139,0.97,1030.596,1038.904,It's possible that increased speeds due to fewer vehicles on the road may have contributed to the increase in deaths.,24,,
140,0.97,1038.904,1045.477,In a normal year we rely on the traffic congestion as a natural calming mechanism.,24,,
141,0.97,1045.477,1059.525,"As we continue to make our way out of the pandemic, I hope we can all realize that traffic death and injury are a public health emergency as well that has been happening in slow motion, not just in 2020, but for decades.",24,,
142,0.97,1059.525,1060.426,"Next slide, please.",24,,
143,0.97,1060.426,1062.995,Why does this tonight to occur?,24,,
144,0.97,1062.995,1068.067,"When we are talking about same system and same outcomes, we are talking about Street design.",24,,
145,0.97,1068.067,1074.64,For decades many of the streets have been designed to move cars quickly at speeds that humans can simply not survive.,24,,
146,0.97,1074.64,1081.113,"We are working to undo that, and we will touch on the importance of lowering vehicle speeds throughout the presentation.",24,,
147,0.97,1081.113,1096.095,"I want to point out half of the fatal and serious injury crashes occur on a tenth of the streets, and these are mostly Multilane, high-speed, high- volume Arterials, and I have listed many of them here.",24,,
148,0.97,1096.095,1115.747,"While we have made significant improvements on portions of Rainier Avenue South and recently Lake City way, and we are actively designing improvements along Martin Luther King Jr. way and working towards a large planning effort on Aurora, there's much more work to be done if we are to achieve vision zero.",24,,
149,0.97,1115.747,1117.015,"Next slide, please.",24,,
150,0.97,1117.015,1124.89,"Year over year, we see the same top distributing factors to crashes.",24,,
151,0.97,1124.89,1127.159,"Speeding, impairment, distraction, and failure to yield to pedestrians.",24,,
152,0.97,1127.159,1132.731,"I want to point out, too, each of the behaviors can be affected by Street design.",24,,
153,0.97,1132.731,1135.1,Smart Street design can slow vehicles down.,24,,
154,0.97,1135.1,1140.806,Speed Isthe critical factor in both the frequency and severity of crashes.,24,,
155,0.97,1140.806,1149.848,"I also want to note on the right of the slide, over the last couple of years we have seen a significant increase in the crashes that are Hit-And- run.",24,,
156,0.97,1149.848,1157.256,That can make it difficult to determine the contributing factors to the crash.,24,,
157,0.97,1157.256,1160.559,"Next slide, please.",24,,
158,0.97,1160.559,1163.328,"Allison, excuse me, Councilmember Strauss?",25,,
159,0.97,1163.328,1170.235,"Thank you, chair Pederson and director Zimbabwe for being with us.",26,,
160,0.97,1170.235,1176.375,On the last slide you said something very quickly that I think is important to call out about speed.,26,,
161,0.97,1176.375,1188.053,"The one common theme I have already heard in the presentation is talking about the need to reduce speed, and I just want to highlight it's not just because we think that it is a good idea.",26,,
162,0.97,1188.053,1196.061,What I heard you say is that speed is the number one--can you repeat it so I don't say it incorrectly?,26,,
163,0.97,1196.061,1203.335,It sounded like it's the number one reason why collisions occur and the number one reason why people don't survive the collision.,26,,
164,0.97,1203.335,1206.805,Can you put it in a more articulate way?,26,,
165,0.97,1206.805,1208.674,Thank you very bringing that up.,27,,
166,0.97,1208.674,1212.344,The phase that I and my team and others use often.,27,,
167,0.97,1212.344,1229.094,"Speed is the critical factor in the frequency and severity of crashes, and we do have a slide later that will specifically talk about some of the physics behind speed and why it matters so much in terms of Survivability when people are involved in crashes at high speeds.",27,,
168,0.97,1229.094,1229.394,Great.,28,,
169,0.97,1229.394,1252.618,"I will wait for that slide to make more comments, but what I just--I know that you have got that great phrase that you use within your team, but what I heard you say is that speed is the determining factor on how many crashes that occur in our city and how badly you are injured if you are hit?",28,,
170,0.97,1252.618,1252.985,Absolutely.,29,,
171,0.97,1252.985,1264.296,"I guess I really just want to raise that because throughout the entire conversation, I think that I have heard you talking about speed.",30,,
172,0.97,1264.296,1268.0,That's why speed is such an important part of the discussion.,30,,
173,0.97,1268.0,1271.903,It's the difference in the number of collisions and how badly people are hurt.,30,,
174,0.97,1271.903,1273.672,I will turn it back to you.,30,,
175,0.97,1273.672,1276.208,Just wanted to highlight what you said.,30,,
176,0.97,1276.208,1277.276,"Thank you, Councilmember.",31,,
177,0.97,1277.276,1282.414,So I want to spend just a moment on talking about what vision zero is.,31,,
178,0.97,1282.414,1290.956,Of course it is a city of Seattle initiative to end the traffic deaths and injuries on the city streets by 2030.,31,,
179,0.97,1290.956,1295.694,What are the key principles that ground the work?,31,,
180,0.97,1295.694,1301.366,"Wih vision zero, we believe that traffic deaths are not inevitable nor are they accidents.",31,,
181,0.97,1301.366,1313.612,"We believe they are preventable through system design that takes into account the fact that humans are not perfect, and we cannot rely on every individual moving in, out, and around the city to make the right choice every time.",31,,
182,0.97,1313.612,1328.86,"What we can do is manage the Seattle streets, sidewalks, and signals in a way that centers the safe movement of people so that when someone makes a mistake, it does not end in injury or death.",31,,
183,0.97,1328.86,1329.161,Next slide.,31,,
184,0.97,1329.161,1332.831,"For the better part of the best several decades, most U.S.",31,,
185,0.97,1332.831,1345.944,"Cities including Seattle have not fully embraced the safe systems approach, and we have relied on the traditional approach of the three es.",31,,
186,0.97,1345.944,1348.814,Often we have replaced equal value on each E. next slide.,31,,
187,0.97,1348.814,1354.586,We want to talk about where that approach of the three es has gotten us.,31,,
188,0.97,1355.587,1361.126,Unfortunately we are no closer to ending traffic deaths.,31,,
189,0.97,1361.126,1367.132,"Looking back across the last decade, we can see a few things.",31,,
190,0.97,1367.132,1371.069,This graph shows the overall trends decline.,31,,
191,0.97,1371.069,1372.938,That's the top dashed line.,31,,
192,0.97,1372.938,1376.074,Increasing for people not protected by vehicles.,31,,
193,0.97,1376.074,1381.747,"Purple lines, and decreasing for people protected by vehicles, the Orange line.",31,,
194,0.97,1381.747,1390.188,I do want to note also we are looking at data SETS in the realm of 20 people per year.,31,,
195,0.97,1390.188,1402.334,"Small changes year-to-year can look like large jumps, but the total fatality trend line is increasing because of crashes with people walking and bikes.",31,,
196,0.97,1402.334,1402.667,Next slide.,31,,
197,0.97,1402.667,1408.173,Vision zero is not just about ending traffic deaths but serious injuries as well.,31,,
198,0.97,1408.173,1428.093,"The total number of serious injure crashes decrease slightly in 2020, what I neglected to point out, the raw number was fewer than the year before, because there were fewer overall crashes, we saw as a percentage serious injury crashes actually increased.",31,,
199,0.97,1428.093,1435.367,"Regardless, it's important to look at the bigger picture to pan out and sigh more than one year at a time.",31,,
200,0.97,1435.367,1438.77,On average we see 160 serious injury crash as year.,31,,
201,0.97,1438.77,1456.655,"Over time we are seeing serious injury crashes remain pretty constant, diminishing at the rate of one less serious injury every two years, meaning at this rate, we will not achieve zero serious injuries until 2280.",31,,
202,0.97,1456.655,1457.823,"Next slide, please.",31,,
203,0.97,1457.823,1463.829,"As highlighted a couple of slides earlier, people outside of vehicles are increasingly affected by crashes.",31,,
204,0.97,1463.829,1479.478,"People walking and Biking are involved in a small percentage of total crashes, 7%, but make up two-thirds of the deaths.",31,,
205,0.97,1479.478,1485.483,We see older adults Overrepresented with the average age of 58 years old.,31,,
206,0.97,1485.483,1491.189,The number of people walking killed in a crash likely experienced homelessness.,31,,
207,0.97,1491.189,1493.291,These are the most vulnerable travelers.,31,,
208,0.97,1493.291,1494.192,"Next slide, please.",31,,
209,0.97,1494.192,1500.499,"We look at race data across fatalities, and we see the black community members are Overrepresented.",31,,
210,0.97,1500.499,1511.476,"This graph shows by the racial category the percent of people killed in traffic collisions, in red, verses the racial demographics of Seattle in blue.",31,,
211,0.97,1511.476,1519.084,There's a clear disparity in one group that I circled here.,31,,
212,0.97,1519.084,1529.528,"7% of residents identify as black, and black people make up 12% of those skilled in the collisions on city streets.",31,,
213,0.97,1529.528,1530.629,"Next slide, please.",31,,
214,0.97,1530.629,1548.146,"Here we have overlaid the fatal crashes with the race and equity composite index, a mix of health indicators and information around race, country of origin, and other variables.",31,,
215,0.97,1548.146,1558.957,"The purple color here indicates the highest disadvantaged based on the index, you can see concentrated in South Seattle and also the very North portion of the city.",31,,
216,0.97,1558.957,1575.74,"Over the last five years, with have seen that 31% of traffic deaths, the dots on the map, are in 20% of the Census tracks, making up the most highly disadvantaged communities.",31,,
217,0.97,1575.74,1577.842,"Next slide, please.",31,,
218,0.97,1577.842,1587.752,"In addition to being disproportionately affected by crashes, black people are disproportionately impacted by traffic enforcement and fines and fees.",31,,
219,0.97,1587.752,1601.466,"Last year the city's office for civil rights commissioned a study led by researches out of Rutgers and Udub, and they presented the finding to the public safety and human services Committee in September of 2020.",31,,
220,0.97,1601.466,1614.312,"They analyzed Seattle municipal court cases from 2000 to 2017 that involved what is called legal financial obligations, and these are the fines, the fees, and other costs that are imposed by the court.",31,,
221,0.97,1614.312,1632.597,"They found that 83% of these cases were traffic Infractions, and the key finding highlighted here on the slide is that in 2017, black drivers in Seattle were issued 2.6 times more traffic Infractions with legal financial obligations per capita than white drivers.",31,,
222,0.97,1632.597,1643.742,"The research goes in depth on the desperate affects of traffic and parking enforcement fines and fees, particularly on black men in Seattle.",31,,
223,0.97,1643.742,1646.978,Typically--go ahead.,31,,
224,0.97,1646.978,1648.146,Councilmember Strauss?,32,,
225,0.97,1648.146,1650.281,I will wait for Allison to finish.,33,,
226,0.97,1650.281,1654.185,Just didn't want to get lost before the next slide.,33,,
227,0.97,1654.185,1654.486,Thanks.,34,,
228,0.97,1654.486,1675.64,"Typically with vision zero, we have thought about harm primarily from the physical perspective reducing harm from crashes, but we also need to recognize and are learning more about the other forms of harm at play including the devastating financial and economic harm that can result as a result of enforcement related to traffic safety.",34,,
229,0.97,1675.64,1677.776,"Next slide, but happy to take a question.",34,,
230,0.97,1677.776,1679.944,May I jump in now?,35,,
231,0.97,1679.944,1696.227,"I just--something I heard earlier in your presentation was that if we create Street design, and you're going to have to put it in the words that are more articulate than what I'm going to generalize.",35,,
232,0.97,1696.227,1701.232,"If we create Street design in an appropriate fashion, we Dn't have to rely on enforcement.",35,,
233,0.97,1701.232,1703.868,Did I hear you say that correctly.,35,,
234,0.97,1703.868,1704.102,Yes.,36,,
235,0.97,1704.102,1706.237,We will talk about it more in a little bit.,36,,
236,0.97,1706.237,1712.277,The phrase we have been using and folks across the country--it's certainly not a conversation unique to Seattle.,36,,
237,0.97,1712.277,1731.863,"People all over the country in similar roles are dealing with, you know, increases in fatalities and also the challenging conversations about, you know, what the role of enforcement is, can be, or should be when it comes to traffic safety.",36,,
238,0.97,1731.863,1736.101,"The phase is, working towards designing Self-Enforcing street.",36,,
239,0.97,1736.101,1743.741,"The design of the street generates the behavior we want to see, rather than having to rely on the traditional enforcement that we have.",36,,
240,0.97,1743.741,1744.209,That's great.,37,,
241,0.97,1744.209,1763.428,"I mean, just to kind of summarize, it sounds like if we create our streets in a way that Channelizes people to get them in their Lane, we don't necessarily have to write tickets that will lead to legal financial obligations?",37,,
242,0.97,1763.428,1763.695,Yes.,38,,
243,0.97,1763.695,1765.163,"Great, thanks.",39,,
244,0.97,1765.163,1771.703,"Highlighting what you're saying, and making sure I'm connecting the dots you're putting out for us.",39,,
245,0.97,1771.703,1772.47,Thank you.,40,,
246,0.97,1772.47,1773.438,"Next slide, please.",40,,
247,0.97,1773.438,1786.384,"So I also wanted to just take a moment to connect the dots between safety and climate, and I feel like the first person who provided public comment did that nicely as well.",40,,
248,0.97,1786.384,1807.005,"They go hand in hand, and we are--in addition from being a ways from achieving vision zero, we are also a ways away from our goals.",40,,
249,0.97,1807.005,1817.148,"We want to give more options for walking, Biking, and transit to reduce reliance on Single-Occupancy vehicles.",40,,
250,0.97,1817.148,1830.128,"While things are not headed in the right direction, we do have a robust set of engineering tools that work, and we were interested in more aggressively pursuing the proven tools.",40,,
251,0.97,1830.128,1834.632,"Next slide, please.",40,,
252,0.97,1834.632,1840.271,"Here's our Speed-Focused slide, Councilmember Strauss, slowing down speeds is key to achieving vision zero.",40,,
253,0.97,1840.271,1852.483,"It's the critical factor in the frequency and severity of crashes, and the graph here highlights the sheer physics and effects higher speeds have on human beings.",40,,
254,0.97,1852.483,1866.231,"Over the last Severalyears and especially in 2020 and into this year, we focused on lowering speed limits citywide in partnership with Washdot.",40,,
255,0.97,1866.231,1873.705,"Thanks to the work of crews, we have 90% of our signs at 20 miles an hour.",40,,
256,0.97,1873.705,1875.473,That's an important first step in the space.,40,,
257,0.97,1875.473,1888.152,"A few years ago when we lowered speed limits in urban villages, we found sign changes alone reduced Top-End speeding by 54% and decreased injury crashed by 20%.",40,,
258,0.97,1888.152,1906.604,"Our work in the space of lowering speed limits has gained national recognition, and while we have seen positive results, we also recognize many streets need to be redesigned to address speeding.",40,,
259,0.97,1906.604,1907.372,"Next slide, please.",40,,
260,0.97,1907.372,1911.209,"Chair, may I ask questions on the last slide?",41,,
261,0.97,1911.209,1913.711,"Yes, please.",42,,
262,0.97,1913.711,1914.045,Apologies.,43,,
263,0.97,1914.045,1921.92,"Thanks this slide especially, it's especially interesting to me.",43,,
264,0.97,1921.92,1927.892,The graph shows how it affects Survivability.,43,,
265,0.97,1927.892,1935.9,"The X axis is speed and Y is Survivability, is that credibility?",43,,
266,0.97,1935.9,1937.969,Yes.,44,,
267,0.97,1937.969,1940.605,"Yeah, how deadly the crash will be.",44,,
268,0.97,1940.605,1954.218,"At 45 miles an hour, and we have some streets in the city, streets not signed for 45 miles an hour, and people drive at 45 miles an hour.",45,,
269,0.97,1954.218,1961.326,"The likelihood of surviving that crash, or that collision is 50/50.",45,,
270,0.97,1961.326,1963.094,Is that correct?,45,,
271,0.97,1963.094,1964.228,Am I reading this correctly?,45,,
272,0.97,1964.228,1978.409,"I don't think it's quite that high, but yes, it depends on how old you are as well given that as we age, our ability to recover and Frailty, the body's resilience comes into play.",46,,
273,0.97,1978.409,1993.057,"Thanks, and then I guess I'm trying to understand this slide a little more, so if I'm on the average of all ages at 45, looking like the intersection is above 50%.",47,,
274,0.97,1993.057,2002.333,Does that mean I have a 45% Survivability rate?,47,,
275,0.97,2002.333,2023.154,"What it is indicating not necessarily the Survivability rate, but how deadly the crash will be, and those two things are related, but what it is clearly indicating, the faster someone is driving, and if they strike someone, particularly an older person, Survivability is going to decrease substantially as the speed increases.",48,,
276,0.97,2025.556,2027.558,Okay.,49,,
277,0.97,2027.558,2036.501,It would be helpful to follow up with specific speeds and specific Survivability rates.,49,,
278,0.97,2036.501,2039.203,I see what your slide here is demonstrating.,49,,
279,0.97,2039.203,2051.983,"I guess at 35 miles an hour, which is what our streets have been, and just using this slide, the Survivability rate looks like it's about 30%.",49,,
280,0.97,2051.983,2059.157,So someone has--I guess is it 70% Survivability or 30%?,49,,
281,0.97,2059.157,2069.033,"I think, on this--as you move up on the Y axis, you're more likely to die from the crash.",50,,
282,0.97,2069.033,2082.313,"That 100% at the top at 60 miles an hour, most people are not going to survive a crash.",50,,
283,0.97,2082.313,2122.22,"You know this is from--it's all--I think this is National data in a variety of different contexts, and I think the specifics of each individual crash play into the level of severity of the crash, but as you said, going from 35 to 25, you move from the place where about half of older adults would not survive a crash to a place where people are much--people of all ages are much more likely to survive the crash if one happens.",50,,
284,0.97,2122.22,2127.658,You're also less likely to have a crash in the first place.,50,,
285,0.97,2127.658,2131.629,That's really helpful director Zimbabwe.,51,,
286,0.97,2131.629,2134.098,"The 70 at 35, it's 50/50.",51,,
287,0.97,2134.098,2138.536,"Drop down to 25, it's closer to about 15%.",51,,
288,0.97,2138.536,2153.184,"That's just such a--for 10 miles an hour, you change the Survivability rate to half.",51,,
289,0.97,2153.184,2158.222,"I called out your comments earlier, Allison about frequency.",51,,
290,0.97,2158.222,2159.724,This is the interlocking Úfactor.,51,,
291,0.97,2159.724,2172.57,"I guess I'm sitting on the slide so much because I personally was hit by a driver while riding my bike, and it was going over 35 miles an hour.",51,,
292,0.97,2172.57,2182.78,"I spent four days in Harborview, and according to this graph, there's a 30% chance I would not be here with you today asking these questions.",51,,
293,0.97,2182.78,2214.011,"I can share more information about that at another time, but the frequency and severity is what I'm going to keep hammering home because if that vehicle, if the driver that hit me was going slower, there would have been less of an opportunity for it to occur, and I would not have spent 12 hours in the er and 36 hours in the Icu and 48 hours in Harborview being monitored.",51,,
294,0.97,2214.011,2218.783,This is not abstract data.,51,,
295,0.97,2218.783,2221.185,This is--I had a 30%--you can move on.,51,,
296,0.97,2221.185,2226.624,I just wanted to make that point.,51,,
297,0.97,2226.624,2230.561,"Councilmember Morales, please?",52,,
298,0.97,2230.561,2231.028,Thank you.,53,,
299,0.97,2231.028,2232.797,I am curious.,53,,
300,0.97,2232.797,2256.988,"I appreciate, you know, the Arterials have been lowered, at least most of them across the city, but having two of the four streets where most of the accidents occur, crashes occur, in my district, it's really clear to me to see lowering the speed limit does not account for poor road design.",53,,
301,0.97,2256.988,2278.943,"We see people speeding, regardless of the new lowered speed limit on the two streets, and so sort of similar to the point that Councilmember Strauss is making, one out of three people hit at 35 miles an hour will die.",53,,
302,0.97,2278.943,2290.988,"I'm curious if we have data on how many people are going over the 25 miles an hour, how many are going over 30 or even over 40.",53,,
303,0.97,2290.988,2293.824,Is any of that being tracked?,53,,
304,0.97,2293.824,2307.204,"Because I don't see that having lowered the speed limit, I mean, obviously if our crashes are still at 160 a year on average, that, by itself is not doing the trick.",53,,
305,0.97,2307.204,2320.418,I'm curious if we are keeping tabs on the frequency of how many people are going over the speed limit.,53,,
306,0.97,2320.418,2332.129,"Yes, we will be--we have in the past, and we will continue to collect data after we installed new speed limit signs and after we redesigned the roads.",54,,
307,0.97,2332.129,2348.012,"We have some data about the effects, the before and after effects of the road Rechannelization particularly for Speeders getting at the importance of Street design.",54,,
308,0.97,2348.012,2365.496,"While we have seen some positive changes, just as a result of lowering speed limits and a more visual Cue for folks, that's not a One-And- done fix, clearly.",54,,
309,0.97,2365.496,2367.965,We need to look at Street design as we do that.,54,,
310,0.97,2367.965,2380.511,"I will wait until you get to those slides, but I have a lot of questions about Rainier Avenue.",55,,
311,0.97,2380.511,2380.878,Okay.,56,,
312,0.97,2380.878,2390.321,"Okay, so let's see, the citywide speed limits are one example of a systemwide improvement that will be necessary to advance vision zero.",57,,
313,0.97,2390.321,2409.206,"We have a comprehensive bicycle and pedestrian safety analysis that has identified other areas of focus to reduce serious crashes, and it recognizes that, you know, we can't end traffic deaths only by chasing fatal crashes.",57,,
314,0.97,2409.206,2413.043,Across the system we need to prevent bad crashes from happening.,57,,
315,0.97,2413.043,2416.847,Another way to do that is by giving pedestrian as head start.,57,,
316,0.97,2416.847,2426.357,"We are seeing positive gains with high schools like leading pedestrian intervals that give people a head start by a few seconds, reducing the conflicts at intersections.",57,,
317,0.97,2426.357,2437.301,Where we have put them and are seeing a 50% reduction in injuries and 35% reduction in serious and fatal crashes.,57,,
318,0.97,2437.301,2438.202,Next slide please.,57,,
319,0.97,2438.202,2438.502,All right.,57,,
320,0.97,2438.502,2443.107,Here's the slide I was just Referencing.,57,,
321,0.97,2443.107,2461.725,"So when we use the complete Street approach, we can improve safety for all travelers this highlights before and after results for the number of road Redesigns that Sdot has put in place over the last decade and more, known as Rechannellizations.",57,,
322,0.97,2461.725,2468.499,"We take the typical four Lane with two travel in each direction, adjusted to one Lane in each direction with the center turn Lane.",57,,
323,0.97,2468.499,2477.541,"It reduces the opportunities for speeding and for collisions, and notably for injury collisions.",57,,
324,0.97,2477.541,2498.095,"The design is Self-Enforcing, encouraging the behavior we are having, and it's slower speed so people can have a greater time to react, a wider field of vision, and if the crash does occur, the impact will likely be lower because of the lower speed, again, critical to the Survivability of people, especially people outside of vehicles.",57,,
325,0.97,2498.095,2506.904,"When we redesign the streets, we are also, you know--it also provides the opportunity to Repurpose some of the additional space for additional loads or uses.",57,,
326,0.97,2515.746,2516.914,Councilmember Morales?,58,,
327,0.97,2516.914,2519.683,So I'm going to go back to Rainier Avenue.,59,,
328,0.97,2519.683,2535.799,"Used as a reference here as a presentation for street design, and even on the portions with the road diet, the center turn Lane is being used as a passing Lane very often, and you know, people frequently speed.",59,,
329,0.97,2535.799,2572.77,"There's regular crashes, and in some places, it's still five lanes wide, and there's very little traffic calming, you know, there's long stretches of the road where there's no traffic lights or Street crossings, and so I am interested in knowing what we can do to make that road safer, how we turn it into a real street that reflects that there are many small businesses, and we have had hundreds of units of housing going up along Rainier Avenue where people are Accessing Lightrail and transit stations.",59,,
330,0.97,2572.77,2579.31,We Node know there are more pedestrians incoming on the road.,59,,
331,0.97,2579.31,2594.959,"I would be interested to learn how we install more Crosswalks and can narrow the lanes or maybe even get rid of the center turn Lane so we can add more, maybe even protected like lanes on there.",59,,
332,0.97,2594.959,2599.797,"I will stop there, but I have a lot of questions for you.",59,,
333,0.97,2599.797,2600.898,Great questions.,60,,
334,0.97,2600.898,2601.832,I appreciate them.,60,,
335,0.97,2601.832,2632.997,"We do, even though we have made investments in Rainier that have produced some positive results, we know that things are still happening on this portion of Rainier Avenue, and we did just do a complete--towards the end of last year, the second phase of improvements on Rainier that extended the Rechannellization to Rainier Beach, and we hope to continue to work south of Henderson as well to make Rainier safer.",60,,
336,0.97,2632.997,2647.578,"To your point, there's possible additional improvements that can and should be made throughout the corridor, and it's a matter of one, ensuring we have the funding to make improvements.",60,,
337,0.97,2647.578,2667.064,"The initial work is to kind of redesign with paint in a lot of ways, with signal timing, and in some Instants, improvements to pedestrian crossings, but there may be more, maybe some more concrete work we can do.",60,,
338,0.97,2667.064,2669.933,Can I follow up with one more?,61,,
339,0.97,2669.933,2670.234,Please.,62,,
340,0.97,2670.234,2679.71,So another portion of the presentation shows the South end is right for safety improvements.,63,,
341,0.97,2679.71,2695.592,"I know that there is an examination through the Rsji lens, and still in the bike master plan, there's the fewer miles funded through construction.",63,,
342,0.97,2695.592,2716.547,"I just am curious why the most diverse area in the city is seeing the least amount of investment, and as your slides are saying, we know people of color are disproportionately impacted by the safety concerns.",63,,
343,0.97,2716.547,2722.453,I can jump in a bit on that and the previous comments as well.,64,,
344,0.97,2722.453,2726.757,I think a lot of this is the pipeline for projects.,64,,
345,0.97,2726.757,2765.629,"We have a lot that is underway and in the planning and design stages, but we have to prime that pump more to be able to deliver, and that also includes being able to engage with communities about how people are traveling and how changes could impact, and we also, you know, in using these streets as examples, we have taken a very Data-Driven approach to vision zero that includes before and after as this shows and also the commitment to come back and continue to work to improve safety along the corridor.",64,,
346,0.97,2765.629,2771.802,"We may make one change, see how it is working, continue that, and other Pivot.",64,,
347,0.97,2771.802,2789.72,"If we are seeing some improvements along the street like Rainier, but not getting to zero that will tell us that we still need to make investments and figure out how to make it truly a safe corridor for everybody.",64,,
348,0.97,2789.72,2802.366,"Things like additional safe crossings, ways to make that center turn line into a Nonpassing Lane, and having it be used for the intended purposes is how we will look at this.",64,,
349,0.97,2802.366,2813.477,"I can tell you, whether it's Rainier or Alaska, people use the center Lane and the painted bike Lane as a passing Lane.",65,,
350,0.97,2813.477,2818.615,That's why I'm pushing so hard for protected bike lanes.,65,,
351,0.97,2818.615,2820.05,Paint doesn't protect anybody.,65,,
352,0.97,2820.05,2820.951,We can continue this conversation later.,65,,
353,0.97,2820.951,2821.185,Thank you.,65,,
354,0.97,2828.859,2830.527,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,66,,
355,0.97,2830.527,2833.664,We can move on --,66,,
356,0.97,2833.664,2835.833,"Excuse me, Councilmember Herbold with a question.",67,,
357,0.97,2835.833,2838.368,"Sorry, a little slow on the draw there.",68,,
358,0.97,2838.368,2839.536,Just going back one slide.,68,,
359,0.97,2839.536,2843.574,Thank you so much.,68,,
360,0.97,2843.574,2848.712,I have a question about the Font there.,68,,
361,0.97,2848.712,2851.215,Is that the whole way or a portion of it?,68,,
362,0.97,2851.215,2885.749,"Running from the dock to the West Seattle bridge, and just want to get a sense of how much of Fontlaroy is covered there, and I want to take this opportunity to ask the question, even though it was one of the fully funded projects in the move levy, the Fontlaroy safety project has been Defunded, and it's still in CIP.",68,,
363,0.97,2885.749,2898.128,"I'm pondering if I should consider that a termination of the project, but just a delay, and also interested in two additional questions.",68,,
364,0.97,2898.128,2915.913,"What time period is this data for on Fontlaroy, and I just want to get a sense of why there's so much variability in the data of injury collections and 40 miles an hour speeding.",68,,
365,0.97,2915.913,2946.376,"Just, you know, obviously comparing Fontlaroy to as Councilmember Morales said, Rainier, where the collisions are down on Fontlaroy significantly, and less so on Rainier where in both instances the 40 miles an hour speeding is down significantly.",68,,
366,0.97,2946.376,2947.945,Significantly more on Rainier than Fontlaroy.,68,,
367,0.97,2947.945,2959.823,"In other words, in one case speeding is down a little, but injury collisions are down a lot, and in another, speeding is down a lot, but injury collisions are down a lot less.",68,,
368,0.97,2959.823,2961.491,Reporter: that's a great question.,69,,
369,0.97,2961.491,2976.073,"I will need to get back to you on the Fontlaroy question around what extent and what time period this is looking at, if that's all right.",69,,
370,0.97,2976.073,2982.245,I think it's both the amount of Fontlaroy that you're covering there.,70,,
371,0.97,2982.245,2988.251,Is that what you mean by Exinnocent.,70,,
372,0.97,2988.251,2998.562,"Yeah, I mean, I think my understanding is it's the part that was Rechannellized.",71,,
373,0.97,2998.562,3022.285,"I think it starts at Edmonds, and I think, just in terms of the percentages t may also help, and I think we could provide to the Council the raw numbers because that also plays into percentages.",71,,
374,0.97,3022.285,3030.394,Some of the percentage drop could be the result of the raw numbers perspective.,71,,
375,0.97,3030.394,3035.899,And then question about the future of --,72,,
376,0.97,3035.899,3060.323,"The future, I mean we have held that project as sound transit goes for the environmental extension process, not knowing exactly how the future construction of that, both in timing and in space would affect the Fontlaroy project.",73,,
377,0.97,3060.323,3079.409,"As the process continues to move, we can discuss how to advance the Investigationments along there as well.",73,,
378,0.97,3079.409,3081.945,"Please continue, Allison.",74,,
379,0.97,3081.945,3082.212,Okay.,75,,
380,0.97,3082.212,3082.546,Thank you.,75,,
381,0.97,3082.546,3083.513,"Next slide, please.",75,,
382,0.97,3083.513,3093.256,I want to circle back to the three es approach.,75,,
383,0.97,3093.256,3110.64,"Guided by the racial equity tool kit and justice goals, we in the vision zero team with folks across Sdot have been asking ourselves a number of questions, and again, guided by the racial equity tool kit.",75,,
384,0.97,3110.64,3114.411,How effective has each of the es been?,75,,
385,0.97,3114.411,3115.979,What are the unintended consequences?,75,,
386,0.97,3115.979,3129.326,I hope the earlier slides have highlighted the approach we have relied on is not getting us closer to where we need to be from a safety or equity perspective.,75,,
387,0.97,3129.326,3129.793,"Next slide, please.",75,,
388,0.97,3129.793,3131.761,There is another E to bring in here.,75,,
389,0.97,3131.761,3140.003,What we are doing is to look to more intentionally ground and center our work in racial equity.,75,,
390,0.97,3140.003,3170.4,"That requires us to think about safety more Holistically, and it will continue to be about protecting people from the harm of a traffic crash, but we need to continue to learn about, acknowledge, and reduce the financial and financial harm that can occur in the Right-Of- way that has resulted in some instances by relying on enforcement to help advance safety.",75,,
391,0.97,3170.4,3191.888,"Now, and looking ahead, we are looking to guide our efforts with the racial equity framework, and we also want to make sure we are actively aligning our work and connecting dots to the recommendations of the transportation equity work group that our colleague in the program have been working very hard on for the last couple of years.",75,,
392,0.97,3191.888,3199.195,"Part of the work includes intentional engagement with black, indigenous, and people of color communities.",75,,
393,0.97,3199.195,3200.096,"Next slide, please.",75,,
394,0.97,3200.096,3217.781,"As we continue to evaluate our efforts and move towards a safe system approach guided by the racial equity framework, I did want to touch on how we are engaging with SPD and enforcement.",75,,
395,0.97,3217.781,3221.251,We are actively continuing to coordinate with the police Department.,75,,
396,0.97,3221.251,3237.2,We have monthly Checkins with the traffic collision investigation squad and a lot of E-Mails and phone calls in between to learn as much as we can in Realtime about the bad crashes are occurring.,75,,
397,0.97,3237.2,3243.773,"We are not requesting targeted enforcement right now, it's certainly within SPD's realm to enforce the rules of the road.",75,,
398,0.97,3243.773,3271.701,"I also want to share my team is getting a racial equity tool kit effort underway related to the automated enforcement programs, specifically the school safety and red light cameras, and we are working in partnership with SPD on that who runs the program and also with the municipal court, again trying to understand the unintended consequences and racial disparities.",75,,
399,0.97,3271.701,3279.376,We are looking for ways to use the Data-Driven approach to reduce fatal and serious injury crashes and advance racial equity.,75,,
400,0.97,3279.376,3289.886,"With that, I think I'm going to hand it back to Sam for the final slide or two.",75,,
401,0.97,3289.886,3291.921,"Thank you, Allison.",76,,
402,0.97,3291.921,3304.167,We want to leave it open up to more conversation and discussion around a couple of key challenges and opportunities.,76,,
403,0.97,3304.167,3310.707,We have talked about some of what has been proven to work and go and do more.,76,,
404,0.97,3310.707,3326.856,"We have not talked as much about--we talked about some of the funding constraints, and vision zero is woven into all of our investments across the Department and all programs.",76,,
405,0.97,3326.856,3336.399,We are very grateful the 2021 vehicle license fee spend plan added more than $1 million to the team budget.,76,,
406,0.97,3336.399,3339.169,It increased the budget alone by 50%.,76,,
407,0.97,3339.169,3350.447,"As Allison and her team work in partnership across the Department, those resources are really critical to Scaling up how we respond and can continue to do more.",76,,
408,0.97,3350.447,3369.365,"We also want to not leave people on an Unhopeful note, even though we have struggled, we have made investments, but we are still fighting the tide, and we have examples of other places that do show it's possible.",76,,
409,0.97,3369.365,3389.385,"The city of Oslow, a little smaller, obviously a different context in some ways, but, you know, some of the same challenges we faced, reached a zero fatalities for pedestrians and cyclists, and that's been over many years of the series of investments.",76,,
410,0.97,3389.385,3419.115,"We are still at the early stages of this, but we do want to leave on a hopeful note that it is possible, and we think we can get there, working together, and it's also something that really requires a Holistic view within Sdot and also within the community and shared commitment to ending the impacts of the traffic crashes on our communities.",76,,
411,0.97,3419.115,3434.564,"I think with that we want to close and have any further discussion, and again, really appreciate the opportunity to have this conversation, and especially without other things on the agenda so we can have more time and space to have it.",76,,
412,0.97,3434.564,3441.471,"Thank you, director and Allison Schwartz and your team as well.",77,,
413,0.97,3441.471,3442.839,"Jim Curtin, good to see you as well.",77,,
414,0.97,3442.839,3444.707,We can open it up for questions.,77,,
415,0.97,3444.707,3448.077,I have a couple just to get things started.,77,,
416,0.97,3448.077,3457.02,"We, obviously, asked a lot of questions along the way, and you can follow up with the vision zero team as well.",77,,
417,0.97,3457.02,3476.172,"I wanted to know, you mentioned Oslow, Norway, and I would like to know, you know, which other similar cities have achieved better safety outcomes, and what specifically are they doing differently than Seattle.",77,,
418,0.97,3476.172,3479.509,Oslow is a hopeful example in terms of them getting to zero.,77,,
419,0.97,3479.509,3507.637,"The limited information I have, I know they also have a strong enforcement program, and obviously they have different contexts there than we do here, and because as I understand it, their enforcement is so strong, and fines are so high and severe, are there other cities we can look at with better outcomes?",77,,
420,0.97,3507.637,3516.88,"That could be a question you get back to us on, rather than putting you on the spot, er feel free to answer.",77,,
421,0.97,3516.88,3519.916,I know Councilmember Morales has Followup questions as well.,77,,
422,0.97,3519.916,3523.92,"Go ahead, Allison.",78,,
423,0.97,3523.92,3525.622,"Sorry, I can't see you.",79,,
424,0.97,3525.622,3537.066,"I mean, I think we tend to point to the European examples because they are the ones who have gotten the closest.",79,,
425,0.97,3537.066,3547.143,"I feel like to Sam's point, the presentation had a little Debbie Downer tone to it, but we are doing, you know, pretty welcome paired to many of the peer cities.",79,,
426,0.97,3547.143,3567.363,"It's hard to make the comparison because we are talking about human lives and talking we certainly don't want to discount the fact that 20 people are dying and 160 more are injured, but amongst our peers in the United States, we are one of the safer cities.",79,,
427,0.97,3567.363,3581.01,"One good city to look at in the U.S. is New York, and just how aggressive nay have been at using the tools we know are working.",79,,
428,0.97,3581.01,3602.799,"Tools proven by our own implementation to work to reduce crashes, and so a variety of traffic calming mechanisms they Aggress I Havely deploy, and then have been doing so for the last for the last seven plus years if not decade more, and they have seen decreases in the pedestrian fatality rates is my understanding.",79,,
429,0.97,3602.799,3606.703,We would be happy to look at other examples.,79,,
430,0.97,3606.703,3622.518,We are pretty constantly engaged with folks through the National Association of city transportation officials and there's a network connecting the peer cities together to constantly exchange information and looking to each other to learn more.,79,,
431,0.97,3622.518,3624.754,Thank you.,80,,
432,0.97,3624.754,3632.095,I would definitely like to hear cities in addition to New York.,80,,
433,0.97,3632.095,3635.865,"They have five boroughs, curious how it will breakdown and compare to Seattle.",80,,
434,0.97,3635.865,3644.574,"Any other cities you can find achieving better outcomes, and Councilmember Morales?",80,,
435,0.97,3644.574,3648.544,Thank you.,81,,
436,0.97,3648.544,3652.882,"Well, I am really curious--first of all, thank you very much.",81,,
437,0.97,3652.882,3673.936,"I think it's obvious the vision zero team is grappling with how to address the fact that 20 people are dying in the city every year, and how to make the kind of investment you need it make to--so it doesn't take us to 2280 or whatever you said of the goal of zero fatalities.",81,,
438,0.97,3673.936,3691.054,"I think a lot of the challenge for us, in our American culture, other road designs are hard to accept.",81,,
439,0.97,3691.054,3697.56,I think we have to move that way.,81,,
440,0.97,3697.56,3721.417,"I know there are examples in Europe, Paris, and during Covid they changed their busiest streets, closed to private, you know, to cars, and San Francisco closed market street, and I know it's possible in Europe and in this country, but what I want to really know, for you, for your team, what is it going to take?",81,,
441,0.97,3721.417,3724.587,A culture issue?,81,,
442,0.97,3724.587,3724.954,Policy issue?,81,,
443,0.97,3724.954,3726.889,You mentioned funding a couple of times.,81,,
444,0.97,3726.889,3739.569,I would be interested to know what kind of funding you need to make the kind of impact that would actually start to move this towards the goal of vision zero.,81,,
445,0.97,3739.569,3745.975,"If funding is the issue, what do you need to achieve the goal?",81,,
446,0.97,3745.975,3764.694,"So, sure, let me take some--the start of that at least, and just going back a little bit to where we have the comparison to other cities, I think every city across the country had a challenging 2020 and so--has had a challenging couple of years.",82,,
447,0.97,3764.694,3793.222,"Some of that is, perhaps, due to things like vehicle design and the visibility of people walking and Biking from larger vehicles as people have opted for larger vehicles as well on the city streets, and Councilmember Morales, to your question, I think it's a range of things.",82,,
448,0.97,3793.222,3797.426,"I'm reluctant to say if we throw more money at it, it will solve everything.",82,,
449,0.97,3797.426,3810.239,We know the streets that are the most challenging for us from a safety perspective are needing substantial investment to redesign.,82,,
450,0.97,3810.239,3844.307,"We didn't talk that much about Aurora today, but highway 99 and Aurora, it remains really the most deadly street in the city, and we are very close to securing the grant to do some really important concept designs and taking that a little beyond concept in some places for how to Reenvision Aurora to really be a safe community Connector, rather than the divider it is today.",82,,
451,0.97,3844.307,3858.221,Making those investments are on a really large scale to make some of those physical changes in a place like Aurora that has been built over years to be much more focused on moving cars than on connecting people.,82,,
452,0.97,3858.221,3875.037,"Some of the other things we did, our program to change out the signs was a minor cost.",82,,
453,0.97,3875.037,3878.341,It's not purely a funding conversation.,82,,
454,0.97,3878.341,3900.896,We have definitely have been having internal conversations within Sdot about where we may be our own obstacle to resolving some of the issues and how we can do that faster and make the decisions that really do Prioritize safety in every one of our projects and decisions.,82,,
455,0.97,3900.896,3902.298,That's not a money issue either.,82,,
456,0.97,3902.298,3916.512,That's making sure we have the internal policies and procedures that look at safety every time in terms of making the decision throughout the Department.,82,,
457,0.97,3916.512,3920.683,That's really critical for achieving vision zero.,82,,
458,0.97,3920.683,3926.222,It's really a mix of things that will get us eventually to the vision.,82,,
459,0.97,3934.764,3935.931,Councilmember Herbold.,83,,
460,0.97,3935.931,3941.203,Another specific question.,84,,
461,0.97,3941.203,3957.32,"I was wonder if, director Zimbabwe, you could speak to the role of the keep it moving streets and stay healthy streets to the thesis it's the design of the street that is important to making streets more safe.",84,,
462,0.97,3957.32,4005.201,"There's a lot of really unsafe driving and historically on Beach drive, and captain Grossman has been very clear He also embraces this concept of the safe design of streets being paramount, and enforcement is not a useful tool, and so just wondering, really, how you see those design tools you have available to you, if properly Resourced, and in helping also to accomplish the vision zero goal in places, but as with the drive.",84,,
463,0.97,4005.201,4007.336,That's a great point.,85,,
464,0.97,4007.336,4013.843,Councilmember Morales also talking about what other cities have done during the recovery from the pandemic.,85,,
465,0.97,4013.843,4020.983,We did clean heavily into the stay healthy streets and keep moving streets in parks as a big tool.,85,,
466,0.97,4020.983,4030.626,"Those have been by and large, most of those, the Alky point an exception, places where there were existing safety investments made.",85,,
467,0.97,4030.626,4036.065,"Neighborhood Greenways we were now opening up to more people walking and Biking, and in different ways.",85,,
468,0.97,4036.065,4052.047,"Some of the underlying investments of those, the safe crossings of the busier streets, they were critical to the ability to do--to see good success with the state healthy streets.",85,,
469,0.97,4052.047,4084.346,"We were still navigating and figuring out what the right way to make some of those interim investments permanent and how to reap the benefits of those in an ongoing basis, and so I think that's a place by place, and as we think about it has changed how we think about deploying new neighborhood Greenways going forward as well, and what we can do in terms of different design approaches from the start.",85,,
470,0.97,4084.346,4099.795,"I think we have seen those be popular, and we have also heard some concerns about the stay healthy streets and want to implement them in an ongoing way that is sensitive to the community concerns and desires as well.",85,,
471,0.97,4099.795,4109.371,"That's definitely part of the Toolbox, and we appreciate the resources that are in the funding proposal from the rescue funds to recovery funds.",85,,
472,0.97,4109.371,4113.409,"I never know what the R is, to help us make the gains permanent as well.",85,,
473,0.97,4124.153,4128.157,"Thank you for that answer, director.",86,,
474,0.97,4128.157,4129.258,Any additional questions?,86,,
475,0.97,4129.258,4136.098,"Sdot is accessible all the time, and we really appreciate their responsiveness.",86,,
476,0.97,4136.098,4136.599,Councilmember Strauss?,86,,
477,0.97,4136.599,4138.434,"Thank you, chair.",87,,
478,0.97,4138.434,4148.577,"I want to Piggyback off your comments regarding Oslow where you mentioned, chair, the high cost of the ticket, and strong enforcement model.",87,,
479,0.97,4148.577,4166.929,"I think something that is really important to go along with that context, and to not just view enforcement in Oslow in a vacuum, they also have separated lanes for everyone, whether it's a pedestrian, someone riding a bike, or driving.",87,,
480,0.97,4166.929,4172.568,"There's a clear place, and it's known to everyone on the road which Lane they need to stay in.",87,,
481,0.97,4172.568,4185.281,"That's also not the case here in our city, and I don't know the relationship with legal and financial obligations.",87,,
482,0.97,4185.281,4198.027,Here in the United States legal and financial obligations going further than the incident in which someone is being reprimanded for.,87,,
483,0.97,4198.027,4214.276,I caution the reliance on enforcement as per the slide we saw in the presentation unless it comes along with the design and infrastructure to keep everyone in their Lane and safe and separated from each other.,87,,
484,0.97,4214.276,4222.952,"Again, just highlighting the slide about frequency and severity.",87,,
485,0.97,4222.952,4231.727,The reason with are lowering the speed limits is to reduce the collisions happening between people and people driving.,87,,
486,0.97,4231.727,4235.397,I heard a term called vulnerable users of the road.,87,,
487,0.97,4235.397,4238.934,"Those are people Biking and walking, and I guess I have trouble with the term.",87,,
488,0.97,4238.934,4249.812,"It's a personal issue for me, and another way of saying it is somebody who does not have a steel cage around them on the road.",87,,
489,0.97,4249.812,4250.045,Right?,87,,
490,0.97,4250.045,4262.424,"So if you are in a car, in a steel box, traveling at 35 miles an hour, you have a very high Survivability rate of a collision.",87,,
491,0.97,4262.424,4271.734,"If you are not inside of that protected box, your Survivability rate is much different.",87,,
492,0.97,4271.734,4272.134,So everyone here.,87,,
493,0.97,4272.134,4273.502,I own a car.,87,,
494,0.97,4273.502,4275.838,I also own a bike.,87,,
495,0.97,4275.838,4277.273,I also walk.,87,,
496,0.97,4277.273,4290.185,"So when you're looking at and thinking about how we use our roads, it's not for a certain segment of the population.",87,,
497,0.97,4290.185,4294.289,"It is for each of us, depending on what we are doing that day.",87,,
498,0.97,4294.289,4339.535,"Many people have taken advantage of the bike shares, and those are people who may not own bikes, and they need a safe and separated place to use those mortal tools without the fear of being injured, and that brings to the point of Connectivity, if you don't have a safe and separated place for people to be able to get around on all modes of transportation, which is walking, riding their bike, using their car, using transit, if you don't have a safe and separated place for each of the modes, people who don't necessarily know how to ride a bike or ride a bike in traffic, they don't have the same access to our streets as everyone else.",87,,
499,0.97,4339.535,4353.115,"Put a different way, if someone grows up in a place that is not the city, doesn't have a high level of fast-moving traffic, they don't have the same level of comfort riding on the street, or putting it another way, again.",87,,
500,0.97,4353.115,4367.062,"If you're five years old or ten years old or a young child, you don't have the perception and Situational awareness to be able to navigate the street if you have a safe and separated bike Lane, you would.",87,,
501,0.97,4367.062,4376.038,That level of stress is lowered to a place that allows someone who does not have the technical ability to use the roadway.,87,,
502,0.97,4376.038,4380.142,I will bring it back to where I started.,87,,
503,0.97,4380.142,4385.547,"Each of us, most of us, own a car.",87,,
504,0.97,4385.547,4388.917,"Most of us will also ride a bike from time to time, and most of us walk.",87,,
505,0.97,4388.917,4395.924,"When we are looking at changing how we design our roadways, it's not for a certain segment of the population.",87,,
506,0.97,4395.924,4403.932,"It's so each of us and all of us can have a safe place to walk, bike, and drive.",87,,
507,0.97,4403.932,4405.434,Those are my thoughts.,87,,
508,0.97,4405.434,4427.656,"I will just kind of close out with, again, bringing, you know, a point to 35 miles an hour verses 25 miles an hour from that slide we saw, and I personally was hit by a driver driving their car at 35 miles an hour and accelerating that put me in the hospital for four I still have pain today from that injury.",87,,
509,0.97,4427.656,4444.84,"If that car had been made out of steel, had not hit a curb before it hit me, or multiple factors, I would not be here with you today having this conversation.",87,,
510,0.97,4444.84,4452.548,"If that car was going 25 miles an hour, just 10 miles an hour difference, I would not have spent as much time in the hospital.",87,,
511,0.97,4452.548,4456.685,"At 20 miles an hour, I wouldn't have had severe injuries.",87,,
512,0.97,4456.685,4460.255,I wouldn't have that today.,87,,
513,0.97,4460.255,4499.261,"So there are many people who have passed away from deadly collisions, and thank you, director, for taking a moment of silence at the top of the meeting, and there's so many more people in our city who have been injured, or whether they were walking or crossing the sidewalk or crossing in the crosswalk, but so many people that you probably know that have been hit, have been injured, and these collisions are preventable, so, again, thank you, Allison, and thank you, director Zimbabwe.",87,,
514,0.97,4499.261,4501.93,I'm sure we will be looking for money to help you continue what you're doing.,87,,
515,0.97,4510.739,4512.441,Thank you.,88,,
516,0.97,4512.441,4540.869,"Just one other question about, you know, coming back to the resource issue that I know that the Department is struggling with, but my recollection is that we also--with the overall levy reduction of $7 million, that there was a reduction in the safe routes to school program, and I think the neighborhood traffic calming program was zeroed out.",89,,
517,0.97,4540.869,4567.496,"There's no funds available there, and for that program this year, can we expect to see resources available for these really important--I mean vision zero is an overall policy goal, but it is made up of different programs that are really critical to meeting those goals.",89,,
518,0.97,4567.496,4571.066,The neighborhood traffic calming program is one program.,89,,
519,0.97,4571.066,4625.387,"The safe routes to schools is another program, and again, District one, there's a group of--there's a coalition of residents called the 16th Avenue Southwest coalition, made up of representatives of the PSA, and then teachers, students, parents, and who have been advocating for safety investments, and I appreciate there was some analysis done around that street associated with the funding, but I'm disappointed that like the investments that we are looking at there are speed bumps, and it seems like needs are much greater 16th Southwest is a major arterial.",89,,
520,0.97,4625.387,4630.993,It is in the area of the school.,89,,
521,0.97,4630.993,4648.076,"Southwest colleges had been asking for help a couple of years ago, and just wanting to understand how much the limitations of what we are doing in that area are about resources verses the analysis around need that I know Sdot has done we are connection West Seattle.",89,,
522,0.97,4652.581,4656.251,"Jim, I don't know if you want to jump in here.",90,,
523,0.97,4656.251,4660.856,I see you coming off mute.,90,,
524,0.97,4660.856,4661.323,Most certainly.,91,,
525,0.97,4661.323,4663.225,"Good morning Councilmembers, thank you.",91,,
526,0.97,4663.225,4667.329,"Coming in late here, but happy to answer questions as well.",91,,
527,0.97,4667.329,4677.172,"You know, to go back, and you talked about safe routes to school funding and neighborhood traffic control funding as well.",91,,
528,0.97,4677.172,4681.143,I think a thanks is in order for Council.,91,,
529,0.97,4681.143,4688.684,"In the last budget process, pardon me, you all took action to add a significant amount of action back into the safe routes to school program.",91,,
530,0.97,4688.684,4704.8,"As you know, it's funded in part by the automated school safety camera program, which, of course, was barely functioning last year as we went to a School-From-Home approach, so thank you to that.",91,,
531,0.97,4704.8,4706.601,I mean it was a huge help.,91,,
532,0.97,4706.601,4714.943,It helped us continue with the great work that is continuing in each and every neighborhood across the city of Seattle from a school perspective.,91,,
533,0.97,4714.943,4718.246,The neighborhood traffic control program is an older program.,91,,
534,0.97,4718.246,4723.852,"It's been in the city for quite some time, but we are really shifting a little bit.",91,,
535,0.97,4723.852,4731.259,"Shifting away from kind of the Stand-Alone request for traffic calming, and moving more towards a Holistic model.",91,,
536,0.97,4731.259,4760.322,"You I have likely heard of the home zone program, and that is, of course, addressing some of those neighborhood traffic control programs and traffic issues, and neighborhoods like Highland Park, South Park, and also in the Rainier Valley, and also in New Holly, and also in other locations as well, and you know, rather than take a Street-By-Street approach, or in many cases the Intersection- By-Intersection approach, we are looking more broadly to look at how we can improve traffic.",91,,
537,0.97,4760.322,4768.33,"Often times what we will do is intervene in one area, and put in a Countermeasure, and you know, we are just pushing people in another area, right?",91,,
538,0.97,4768.33,4796.558,"So we want to make sure we are thinking as Holistically as we can, when it comes to the neighborhood traffic issues, and regarding 16th Avenue Southwest, the street that I was on just a few days ago, and you know, I think we have a lot of challenges since the West Seattle bridge closed as you know, and we are looking to bring some much-needed changes out there.",91,,
539,0.97,4796.558,4802.13,There's been a lot of speed bumps and speed cushions added over the years.,91,,
540,0.97,4802.13,4819.881,"We have added several new pedestrian and bicycle crossing on the corridor from Henderson north of the college, up in that area, and we are looking to help with the Infrastructures around Santa Sloane elementary as well.",91,,
541,0.97,4819.881,4822.984,There's Quirky streets where the grid is not square like we like.,91,,
542,0.97,4822.984,4833.428,"We are squaring up the intersections, and making walking, driving, and Bicycling in the area more organized for everyone.",91,,
543,0.97,4833.428,4857.252,"And then, finally I think, last but not least, we are looking at the Channelization on 16th Avenue, and sometimes we do find that a little bit of paint goes a long way, and visually narrowing the roadway, and reducing the speeds we see from drivers and also creating shorter crossings for people who are walking and Biking across 16th.",91,,
544,0.97,4857.252,4862.39,To follow up with a question if I could.,92,,
545,0.97,4862.39,4870.665,"Jim, the references to the changes around Santa Sloane, you're talking about past projects?",92,,
546,0.97,4870.665,4874.369,We have done a lot of work --,93,,
547,0.97,4874.369,4875.37,I know.,94,,
548,0.97,4875.37,4884.846,"I want to tell the constituents, I'm getting a lot of E-Mails right now, and I want to--I appreciate the work that has been done.",94,,
549,0.97,4884.846,4911.94,"It's been fantastic, but I don't want to talk about something you're doing in the future if what you are talking to me about now is the past work, and I want to focus on, so, for instance, you're talking about some changes on 16th that are not Referenced in the most recent constituent communication, and it's only focused on the speed bumps.",94,,
550,0.97,4911.94,4918.88,I want to tell people what else you're looking to do there.,94,,
551,0.97,4918.88,4919.147,Yeah.,95,,
552,0.97,4919.147,4921.983,I was most certainly Referencing what we had done in the past.,95,,
553,0.97,4921.983,4922.984,We are not done.,95,,
554,0.97,4922.984,4926.621,That's one thing about the safe routes to school program.,95,,
555,0.97,4926.621,4935.964,"When we go out and engage with constituents and people who work at the school, we have a laundry list of things that need to be done.",95,,
556,0.97,4935.964,4942.737,"We are not done, and I will get with the team, and I will get you the latest and greatest information as soon as I can.",95,,
557,0.97,4942.737,4943.538,Thank you so much.,96,,
558,0.97,4947.342,4953.114,"Thank you, Councilmember, and thank you to the vision zero team and director Zimbabwe.",97,,
559,0.97,4953.114,4954.416,Appreciate your time today.,97,,
560,0.97,4954.416,4957.152,I know you are accessible and responsive to us.,97,,
561,0.97,4957.152,4976.438,"We will reach out with any additional questions, and I wanted to--I'm glad we were able to focus on this very important item today for the entire meeting, and with that, I will go ahead and conclude the meeting, and this concludes the June 2ND, 2021 meeting of the transportation and utilities committee.",97,,
562,0.97,4976.438,4979.174,The committee plans to meet again on June 16th.,97,,
563,0.97,4979.174,4981.776,"Thank you, everybody, for attending.",97,,
564,0.97,4981.776,4982.177,We are adjourned.,97,,
565,0.97,4982.177,4982.31,Bye.,97,,
