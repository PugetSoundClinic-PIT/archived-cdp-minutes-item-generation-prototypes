242,0.97,1384.316,1387.919,It is certainly something that the Union has the power to bargain.,64,,
243,0.97,1387.919,1392.624,I wanted to stand in solidarity with all the Union members in the central staff.,64,,
244,0.97,1392.624,1403.602,"Just a recommendation Finally, I have for unions bargaining this and other Union contracts, is to do everything in their power to remove no strike clauses.",64,,
245,0.97,1403.602,1410.308,Most Union contracts in the U.S. today have no strike causes that prohibit strikes during the contract.,64,,
246,0.97,1410.308,1414.98,That was not always the case and is unfortunate because it abandons one of the most important forms of worker power in advance.,64,,

563,0.97,2812.242,2819.55,"My comments are for both the agenda items 10 and 11 of today's agenda, which are connected.",225,,
564,0.97,2819.55,2830.16,These agenda items approve the Seattle Department and parking enforcement's use of automatic license plate readers as a patrol car drives around with an automatic license plate reader.,225,,
565,0.97,2830.16,2840.871,"It automatically scans every license plate it sees, records the number, and compares it with a list of numbers it is looking out for.",225,,
566,0.97,2840.871,2849.446,"To be clear, it scans and reads every license plate it sees, whether or not you are doing anything wrong or illegal.",225,,
567,0.97,2849.446,2855.953,It is the automated equivalent of facial recognition software being randomly used by the police on every face they see.,225,,
568,0.97,2855.953,2857.955,It's an unacceptable infringement on privacy in my view.,225,,
569,0.97,2857.955,2863.66,It is also important to have this security being used.,225,,
570,0.97,2863.66,2874.004,According to the surveillance impact report it is used to enforce the Scofflaw ordinance which Emigrant Criminalizes people for being poor.,225,,
571,0.97,2874.004,2883.58,If you cannot pay your parking tickets you are declared a Scofflaw and the city moves or pose your car.,225,,
572,0.97,2883.58,2899.029,"For people who allow their vehicle t get to work, or are forced to live in their vehicles, this can be particularly devastating if the police drive passed your car and you have unpaid parking Útickets and you cannot afford, the computer will announce that you should be booted or towed.",225,,
573,0.97,2899.029,2901.832,Even if you're parked illegally at the time.,225,,
574,0.97,2901.832,2908.205,The surveillance impact report also says that this technology is used to find people with outstanding warrants.,225,,
575,0.97,2908.205,2915.846,"Think about Daunte Wright was stopped first for expired plates, and then for an outstanding warrant, before he was killed.",225,,
576,0.97,2915.846,2922.152,This was technology allowed the police to do more traffic stops like that.,225,,
577,0.97,2922.152,2931.929,"No doubt, proponents of this technology will .2 uses like amber alert, but the reality is you do not need a computer for serious issues which would generate amber alert.",225,,
578,0.97,2931.929,2945.142,Human beings will look for a car in an amber alert you need the computerized technology only when you want to Scan everyone looking for minor things like unpaid parking tickets.,225,,
579,0.97,2945.142,2952.649,This is a technology that Prioritizes the power of the police over the privacy of ordinary citizens.,225,,
580,0.97,2952.649,2959.956,"I will be voting no on items 10 and 11, authorizing the approval of this surveillance technology.",225,,
