45,0.97,153.253,153.62,And thank you.,17,,
46,0.97,153.62,166.165,"As we see at all levels of government throughout our nation, the budget for our Department of Transportation is facing the reality of back to back budget deficits.",17,,
47,0.97,166.165,171.104,As transportation revenue sources drop dramatically due to the Covid pandemic and the related economic recession.,17,,
48,0.97,171.104,186.786,"In light of the budget deficits, I know director Zimbabwe and his executive team of experts at Sdot have been working hard to Prioritize our investments to determine where to trim expenses, pause projects.",17,,
49,0.97,186.786,191.758,Give extra attention to things like the West Seattle bridge.,17,,
50,0.97,191.758,201.167,"And, despite temporary reductions elsewhere, I'm glad to see the Mayor and Sdot striving to maintain funding levels for maintenance of our city's aging bridges.",17,,
51,0.97,201.167,203.436,Similar to the 2020 investment levels.,17,,
52,0.97,203.436,217.884,"However, it is important to remind everybody that our city auditor's recent report on all bridges throughout our city calls for substantially more spending on bridge maintenance to keep them safe and functional.",17,,
53,0.97,217.884,222.188,I appreciate Sdot Concurring with the auditor's recommendations on this need.,17,,
54,0.97,222.188,245.645,"Therefore, if there are any opportunities to increase or change Szot's budget between now and then the Council ADOPTS it, if the revenue forecast improves or if we find savings elsewhere in the budget, I would hope to see more dollars go into bridge maintenance so we truly acknowledge the alarming Wakeup call from the sudden closure of the West Seattle bridge.",17,,
55,0.97,245.645,254.721,"And now, the recognition of the poor condition of several other city bridges.",17,,
56,0.97,254.721,261.361,"I'll have questions throughout the process, but I think Sdot is off to a solid start with our fiscal constraints.",17,,
57,0.97,261.361,266.866,I believe they are doing their best to keep people and freight moving.,17,,
58,0.97,266.866,267.767,To encourage transit.,17,,
59,0.97,267.767,268.635,To benefit the environment.,17,,
60,0.97,268.635,276.276,And to keep pedestrians safe throughout our city.,17,,
61,0.97,276.276,278.911,I look forward to hearing from Sdot today.,17,,
62,0.97,278.911,284.984,"Thank you very much, chair Pederson.",18,,
63,0.97,284.984,289.055,"And again, thank you director Zimbabwe.",18,,
64,0.97,289.055,291.157,"Great to have your team here, we will turn it back to you.",18,,
65,0.97,291.157,306.305,"I'll give a little bit of an opening, Kris Castleman, our Finance administrative director will talk through some of the details of the budget and I'll come back at the end to talk some of the conclusions.",19,,
66,0.97,306.305,314.547,"As always, if you have questions, feel free to interrupt and ask at any point as we go through this presentation.",19,,
67,0.97,314.547,322.822,As we all can acutely understand the Mayor's 2021 proposed budget comes during a series of challenges for the city.,19,,
68,0.97,322.822,323.256,A global pandemic.,19,,
69,0.97,323.256,327.56,"An economic recession, a civil rights reckoning.",19,,
70,0.97,327.56,330.463,Devastating wild fires exacerbated by climate change.,19,,
71,0.97,330.463,331.23,A continued housing crisis.,19,,
72,0.97,331.23,335.802,Infrastructure challenges in our city have combined to make this budget unlike any other.,19,,
73,0.97,335.802,342.909,They are significant on their own let alone at the same time.,19,,
74,0.97,342.909,349.148,Sdot faces significant budget challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic and specific declining revenues.,19,,
75,0.97,349.148,354.153,The majority of projects nonetheless remain on track.,19,,
76,0.97,354.153,367.633,Our approach to meeting the current budget shortfall recognizes that the revenue will recover as the economy does and there is a great deal of uncertainty as to when and how that will happen.,19,,
77,0.97,367.633,373.239,"To the greatest extent possibility, we may have the opportunity to scale back up our investments on these critical needs.",19,,
78,0.97,373.239,375.041,We want to be clear eyed.,19,,
79,0.97,375.041,379.245,"However, about the immediate challenges before us in 2021.",19,,
80,0.97,379.245,379.746,"And, beyond.",19,,
81,0.97,379.746,381.647,We in Seattle are an exceptional city.,19,,
82,0.97,381.647,387.553,But we are not an exception when it comes to the staggering impacts that Covid-19 has had and continues to have on our economy.,19,,
83,0.97,387.553,390.823,Just like all cities large and small across the country.,19,,
84,0.97,390.823,396.496,"As the Council knows, since March, 2020, our economy has been hit again and again.",19,,
85,0.97,396.496,399.999,"And, these are not levels of impact that can be Tweaked at the margin.",19,,
86,0.97,399.999,404.704,Especially when it comes to some of the transportation specific revenue sources.,19,,
87,0.97,404.704,409.609,It requires hard decisions across the board and with real consequences and impacts.,19,,
88,0.97,409.609,414.614,"In many ways, this is acutely so for Sdot in 2021.",19,,
89,0.97,414.614,421.12,We are facing significant declines and projected revenues.,19,,
90,0.97,421.12,426.559,"As we move into 2021, our funding gap was estimated to be $81 million.",19,,
91,0.97,426.559,436.235,The actions we took in 2020 and propose to take in 2021 should prevent deeper cuts in the future.,19,,
92,0.97,436.235,440.606,Sdot is funded by a variety of local and state funding sources.,19,,
93,0.97,440.606,460.493,We rely on Federal and regional grants and local partnerships to support many of our capital projects . SDO @'s local revenues continue to decline rapidly and there is concern about the future of state funding levels.,19,,
94,0.97,460.493,470.369,We are facing historic shortfalls in funding sources across the board.,19,,
95,0.97,470.369,472.972,We made hard decisions through 2020.,19,,
96,0.97,472.972,494.36,"Froze spending, paused or delayed projects and spent on one time revenue sources to limit the impacts while maintaining existing staffing levels . We still faced hard choices on which would be paused.",19,,
97,0.97,494.36,501.5,Things that needed to be added or removed from the paused list and these challenges carry with us into 2021.,19,,
98,0.97,501.5,508.174,The key sources of revenue are sensitive to the up and down economy.,19,,
99,0.97,508.174,515.882,"In all instances, it will be incumbent on us to how we allocate the fewer resources to meet the demands of these challenging times.",19,,
100,0.97,515.882,525.024,"As we center the needs of communities and address our own ongoing asset maintenance needs across our portfolio, it is ever more important.",19,,
101,0.97,525.024,534.8,One way we will be seeking input from communities across the city is through the move Seattle levee assessment process.,19,,
102,0.97,534.8,542.375,A review of our commitments as we pass the midpoint of that.,19,,
103,0.97,542.375,549.015,We will need to continue to Prioritize resources for emerging needs like our Covid- 19 response.,19,,
104,0.97,549.015,554.687,Efforts to support small businesses and the West Seattle High-Rise bridge.,19,,
105,0.97,554.687,559.525,Feedback from stake holders in the public will play an important role in shaping our path forward.,19,,
106,0.97,559.525,576.242,All of our decisions were filtered through a core values frame work that has and will continue to guide Sdot through cheese choppy waters including engaging in an equity recovery process to minimize direct impacts to vulnerable and Underserved communities.,19,,
107,0.97,576.242,586.519,"As the city and as the Department, we have Underinvested in many of our communities historically, the black lives matter movement.",19,,
108,0.97,586.519,590.356,The historic impacts of the Covid-19.,19,,
109,0.97,590.356,595.328,It means we must take an equity lens to all of our budget decisions.,19,,
110,0.97,595.328,601.334,We must ensure our transportation system meets the needs of our community of color and all incomes and abilities.,19,,
111,0.97,601.334,608.207,Our goal is to build a racially equitable and socially just transportation system.,19,,
112,0.97,608.207,619.151,While budget reductions impact all Seattleites it is my work to address disparities in communities including authentic engagement on long standing needs.,19,,
113,0.97,619.151,627.059,They will continue to be a community dialogue around transportation equity and how transportation is an important component to community health and safety.,19,,
114,0.97,627.059,629.795,We need to be able to engage in this dialogue.,19,,
115,0.97,629.795,643.576,Be transparent on how and why transportation system Diggal investments are changing with an equity lens and remain nimble in how we meet community needs as part of the city wide conversation and conversation.,19,,
116,0.97,643.576,648.18,Second value is preserving Sdot capacity for rapid recovery efforts.,19,,
117,0.97,648.18,652.852,This maintains our ability to respond to our emerging needs.,19,,
118,0.97,652.852,653.686,Drive economic recovery efforts.,19,,
119,0.97,653.686,658.491,And move rapidly with our own West Seattle bridge mitigation efforts and other issues as they emerge.,19,,
120,0.97,658.491,661.394,Our third is to maintain public safety.,19,,
121,0.97,661.394,668.534,Maintaining safety for the traveling public is a top priority for us at Sdot.,19,,
122,0.97,668.534,668.968,Asset maintenance.,19,,
123,0.97,668.968,671.971,"Vision zero programs, Sdot is responsible for the safety of everyone in our system.",19,,
124,0.97,671.971,676.175,And we need to continue investing in all of our infrastructure.,19,,
125,0.97,676.175,683.783,Within this broader context comes the critical consideration of bridge operations and maintenance as Councilmember Pederson said before.,19,,
126,0.97,683.783,688.554,This was underscored in the helpful report by the office of the city auditor on vehicle bridge INS the city.,19,,
127,0.97,688.554,695.695,There's a critical need for new bridge maintenance funding consistent with previous Sdot assessments.,19,,
128,0.97,695.695,707.173,"Until we work to find sustainable solutions, this will continue to be a key challenge that cannot be resolved without new resources and taking into consideration public safety operations.",19,,
129,0.97,707.173,715.047,The next value is to consider our fight against climate change by Prioritizing our Úmultimodal investments.,19,,
130,0.97,715.047,718.017,We cannot fail to make progress in our fight against climate change.,19,,
131,0.97,718.017,729.261,Transportation is the number one contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Seattle and we will continue to Prioritize lowering carbon emissions from this sector.,19,,
132,0.97,729.261,732.031,The next value is maximizing Federal and state funding opportunities.,19,,
133,0.97,732.031,739.238,We need to retain our readiness to retain grants for programs that leverage our investments as a city.,19,,
134,0.97,739.238,744.91,The last of those is maintaining flexibility and funding in our programs.,19,,
135,0.97,744.91,754.153,We have chosen to postpone discreet capital projects maintaining funding in programs that deliver on our commitments and priorities and maintain basic services throughout the city.,19,,
136,0.97,754.153,762.261,"We want to be very clear, the city and Sdot will be very busy in 2021 delivering on many projects Creaturing critical milestones along the way.",19,,
137,0.97,762.261,776.342,"Despite the pandemic, we have continued to deliver in every way possible while facing competing priorities.",19,,
138,0.97,776.342,776.876,Limited staff resources.,19,,
139,0.97,776.876,780.746,The successes can be seen across town.,19,,
140,0.97,780.746,787.953,We have the Lander Street Overpass which will open next week.,19,,
141,0.97,787.953,792.391,The fair view bridge replacement.,19,,
142,0.97,792.391,793.125,New sidewalks.,19,,
143,0.97,793.125,799.064,Pavement on North 40th and 50th as part of green Lake and Wallingford.,19,,
144,0.97,799.064,802.234,Northeast Pacific Street next to Uw medical hospital.,19,,
145,0.97,802.234,812.778,We have completed seismic Retro fit work and have similar efforts on the House Street bridge wrapping up this winter.,20,,
146,0.97,812.778,816.816,We have cleared Federal readiness requirements on the Madison Brt corridor.,20,,
147,0.97,816.816,821.32,We completed construction on the first phase of the fourth Avenue protected bike Lane.,20,,
148,0.97,821.32,825.591,This is just a few of the successes we have had as a department.,20,,
149,0.97,825.591,828.928,The reality is we need to continue our investment in the transportation system.,20,,
150,0.97,828.928,831.363,Despite the things outside of our control.,20,,
151,0.97,831.363,843.175,"In the coming weeks and months, there are important areas where we can have some control and be very intentional in our actions.",20,,
152,0.97,843.175,848.781,The levee assessment process is one of those.,20,,
153,0.97,848.781,857.456,How we can center equity in current levy.,20,,
154,0.97,857.456,862.861,"And, progressive tools we need to deliver on all commitments we have as a Department and as a city.",20,,
155,0.97,862.861,871.537,"As the fastest growing city of the last decade, we have ha lot of catching up to do.",20,,
156,0.97,871.537,875.107,This is highlighted again on the city auditor.,20,,
157,0.97,875.107,884.25,"At the same time, as, the pandemic has impacted all of our revenue stream.",20,,
158,0.97,884.25,897.429,The fact that the initiative 976 which further limits those revenue streams makes clear we need to have conversations in Washington DC and Olympia about sustainable scale able sources of revenue to fund our transportation system.,20,,
159,0.97,897.429,910.676,"Before I move on and turn it over to Chris and I am getting to the end of this introduction, I would like to talk about the proposed transfer of parking enforcement functions to Sdot.",20,,
160,0.97,910.676,913.579,This are presents over 120 hard working women and men.,20,,
161,0.97,913.579,918.05,We have had a good relationship with our curb side team and the park enforcement officers.,20,,
162,0.97,918.05,922.688,There are so many opportunities bringing the policy development and implementation closer together.,20,,
163,0.97,922.688,938.771,"Seeing how the role of parking enforcement officers can be broadened . I support, I and the rest of Sdot are excited about the opportunities this potential Transfor presents.",20,,
164,0.97,938.771,940.94,So we talked about a lot of big challenges.,20,,
165,0.97,940.94,949.848,Ones we can tackle together and I look forward to doing that with you all and the community to map out an equitable inclusive Impactful path forward.,20,,
166,0.97,949.848,959.291,"With that, I will turn it over to Chris Castleman to talk through some of the detailed elements of our budget and I will come back at the end to talk about a few other items.",20,,
167,0.97,959.291,966.031,"And again, if there's any questions at this point or any point in the future, please feel free.",20,,

182,0.97,1024.723,1025.023,Wonderful.,27,,
183,0.97,1025.023,1028.093,Thank you very much.,27,,
184,0.97,1028.093,1031.296,How does that look?,28,,
185,0.97,1031.296,1032.131,Perfect.,29,,
186,0.97,1032.131,1035.034,Okay.,30,,
187,0.97,1035.034,1039.171,"Thank you, Sam.",31,,
188,0.97,1039.171,1039.438,Sure.,32,,
189,0.97,1039.438,1039.805,Multitalented.,32,,
190,0.97,1039.805,1041.24,All right.,33,,
191,0.97,1041.24,1042.474,"Well, again, good afternoon, Councilmembers.",33,,
192,0.97,1042.474,1049.014,Thank you very much for this opportunity to go through what is happening with Sdot's budget in 2020 and 2021.,33,,
193,0.97,1049.014,1053.952,I'll be looking a little bit in this direction because this is where my notes are.,33,,
194,0.97,1053.952,1054.353,So I apologize.,33,,
195,0.97,1054.353,1061.794,I'm not looking directly in the camera but I think you are probably all looking at the slide Tech.,33,,
196,0.97,1061.794,1069.401,"So, I'll be walking you through the high level view of our proposed budget including key changes to our budget an CIP.",33,,
197,0.97,1069.401,1070.135,And other noteworthy items.,33,,
198,0.97,1070.135,1076.408,And I will be speaking directly from the slides you have in front of you.,33,,
199,0.97,1076.408,1085.284,"For the general Fund, this slide demonstrates the significant general fund reduction Sdot took this year in the 2020 rebalancing effort.",33,,
200,0.97,1085.284,1092.291,Largely to help the city balance declining revenues due to Covid-19 impacts.,33,,
201,0.97,1092.291,1100.999,You'll see that our 2020 revised general fund appropriation is 25% lower than the 2020 adopted.,33,,
202,0.97,1100.999,1109.208,"However, in the 2021 proposed budget, Sdot's general fund appropriation has a $15.8 million increase which isn't called out specifically on this slide.",33,,
203,0.97,1109.208,1111.443,"But, you'll see it in the next slide.",33,,
204,0.97,1111.443,1119.818,"And, this is due to the transfer of the parking enforcement function from SPD to Sdot.",33,,
205,0.97,1119.818,1136.301,This increase is partially offset by yet additional general fund reductions that are needed once again in support of the city's overall balancing efforts for 2021.,33,,
206,0.97,1136.301,1147.479,"In other appropriations, the 2020 revised other appropriation number is not an apples to apples comparison with the adopted or proposed views.",33,,
207,0.97,1147.479,1155.087,This is because Sdot's revised budget includes capital carry forward.,33,,
208,0.97,1155.087,1175.107,"Specifically, the net $319 million increase in 2020 revised other include as 227, excuse me, $277 million carry forward of 2019 capital funding.",33,,
209,0.97,1175.107,1184.917,$13Million in few funding for capital projects and a reduction in budgets related to Covid-19 and other small adjustments.,33,,
210,0.97,1184.917,1199.097,I want to point out this overall change is in fact inclusive of $73 million allocated to the West Seattle bridge program immediate response.,33,,
211,0.97,1199.097,1204.57,"Overall, for the Department, you'll note that we do have an ft increase.",33,,
212,0.97,1204.57,1215.013,This is due to the transfer of the FTE coming over from SPD.,33,,
213,0.97,1215.013,1217.382,123 in total including indirect support positions.,33,,
214,0.97,1217.382,1233.332,A transfer of the position from the office of Intergovernmental relations and the aggregation of three vacant positions.,33,,
215,0.97,1233.332,1235.334,Next slide.,33,,
216,0.97,1235.334,1240.639,On the overall budget.,34,,
217,0.97,1240.639,1244.71,"Councilmember Pederson, are there any Excellents?",34,,
218,0.97,1244.71,1252.15,I appreciate them highlighting the complexity of trying to compare apples to apples.,35,,
219,0.97,1252.15,1254.853,It is hard with the carry forward.,35,,
220,0.97,1254.853,1264.329,"And, the parking enforcement explaining, walking folks through that.",35,,
221,0.97,1264.329,1264.663,Excellent.,36,,
222,0.97,1264.663,1265.03,All right.,37,,
223,0.97,1265.03,1273.405,"So, the next three slides will touch upon some of the more significant changes to Sdot's budget in 2021.",38,,
224,0.97,1273.405,1279.645,I want to draw your attention to one thing right from the start.,38,,
225,0.97,1279.645,1304.336,"Please note that where asterisks are shown, we are highlighting for your awareness that there could be impacts associated with that particular budget change that are not reflected through actual FTE changes but we expect to manage the Stafferring impacts within our existing position authority.",38,,
226,0.97,1304.336,1307.973,"All right, so parking enforcement.",38,,
227,0.97,1307.973,1309.975,Sam already mentioned it.,38,,
228,0.97,1309.975,1310.642,As did Councilmember Pederson.,38,,
229,0.97,1310.642,1317.349,"So, item number one in the general fund.",38,,
230,0.97,1317.349,1321.486,This change reflects the program from SPD to Sdot.,38,,
231,0.97,1321.486,1328.193,Included are all direct and indirect costs associated with the program.,38,,
232,0.97,1328.193,1333.498,"In addition, many parking enforcement officers provide traffic support for events.",38,,
233,0.97,1333.498,1340.172,"Within this number is $800,000 of overtime for special events that is also transferred to Sdot.",38,,
234,0.97,1340.172,1353.919,"As I mentioned, the change includes the transfer of 123 FTE from SPD to Sdot.",38,,
235,0.97,1353.919,1355.253,All right.,38,,
236,0.97,1355.253,1357.956,Item number two.,38,,
237,0.97,1357.956,1359.091,West Seattle bridge program.,38,,

240,0.97,1384.383,1385.15,Analysis and design.,38,,
241,0.97,1385.15,1398.597,It also includes funding for repairs and enhancements to the Spokane swing bridge or low bridge.,38,,
242,0.97,1398.597,1400.999,This CIP program funds Reconnect Seattle.,38,,
243,0.97,1400.999,1410.008,A broad Multimodal strategy to accommodate cross Duamish travel.,38,,
244,0.97,1410.008,1412.177,"So, this is the person with the Asterisk.",38,,
245,0.97,1412.177,1430.829,"Why this person does not result in the creation of new FTE, there are positive changes for staff positions as they shift from work that may no longer be funded elsewhere in the Department to work that supports this program.",38,,
246,0.97,1430.829,1431.363,All right.,39,,
247,0.97,1431.363,1435.233,Moving onto item number three.,39,,
248,0.97,1435.233,1439.571,The Seattle transportation benefit district.,39,,
249,0.97,1439.571,1441.139,Otherwise known as Stpd.,39,,
250,0.97,1441.139,1448.613,"In November 2014, voters approved the Stpd proposition one which provides a $60 vehicle license fee.",39,,
251,0.97,1448.613,1464.229,"And a .1% sales tax to purchase enhanced transit service from King County Metro, support low income transit access programs.",39,,
252,0.97,1464.229,1470.735,Stpd funds the Orca opportunity program and limited transit capital investments.,39,,
253,0.97,1470.735,1472.971,This measure expires on December 31st as you all know.,39,,
254,0.97,1472.971,1479.744,"So, this change removes the associated budget from Sdot's baseline operating budget.",39,,
255,0.97,1479.744,1485.75,"As a result of your action earlier this summer, a new initiative will be considered by voters this November.",39,,
256,0.97,1485.75,1488.954,To go into effect on January 1 should it pass.,39,,
257,0.97,1488.954,1498.697,"That proposal will include funding for King County Metro service, transit related capital improvements.",39,,
258,0.97,1498.697,1504.269,Transit access programs an other emerging needs.,39,,
259,0.97,1504.269,1512.41,"If approved by the voters, it will need to be established.",39,,
260,0.97,1512.41,1514.412,So future supplemental action will be necessary.,39,,
261,0.97,1514.412,1517.315,This also has an Asterisk.,39,,
262,0.97,1517.315,1520.452,Sdot has allocated staffing resources to the existing measure in support of the program.,39,,
263,0.97,1520.452,1522.954,And the services that it provides.,39,,
264,0.97,1522.954,1534.332,"In the event that the new measure passes, staffing resources will be dedicated to support the new program.",39,,
265,0.97,1534.332,1542.507,"Chris, really quickly on that last slide, specifically as it relate to the benefits district.",40,,
266,0.97,1542.507,1550.849,You mentioned we will need to have supplemental budget action depending on the outcome of proposition one.,40,,
267,0.97,1550.849,1563.728,Do you have a sense of whether that will occur in December for example or are we looking at first quarter of 2021?,40,,
268,0.97,1563.728,1567.399,"Well, I believe, so, director noble can correct me if I misstate this.",41,,
269,0.97,1567.399,1573.271,But we have to wait for the results of the election to be Certifid.,41,,
270,0.97,1573.271,1581.179,"Because the change would be for the 2021, it would be a change to the 2021 adopted budget.",41,,
271,0.97,1581.179,1589.654,That would have to be accomplished through a supplemental in 2021.,41,,
272,0.97,1589.654,1599.931,I don't believe the Council can amend the 2021 adopted budget in the current year.,41,,
273,0.97,1599.931,1603.335,The current calendar year.,41,,
274,0.97,1603.335,1604.269,Did I get that right?,41,,
275,0.97,1604.269,1611.81,I think there won't be any harm in waiting until the first part of next year.,42,,
276,0.97,1611.81,1621.486,"Alternatively, we may have depending on the clarity or not of the initial results, where things are headed.",42,,
277,0.97,1621.486,1623.922,We can sort out the details.,42,,
278,0.97,1623.922,1628.626,I don't think they will be an issue.,42,,
279,0.97,1628.626,1648.88,"So, in other words, for purposes of our budget exercise this fall, we don't need to change course or accommodate our budgeting process based on whatever results come out of this falls election cycle.",43,,
280,0.97,1648.88,1653.852,That's sort of what I'm trying to Suss out here.,43,,
281,0.97,1653.852,1664.596,We will likely know the results of the election and like we have certification before the final vote on the 2021 budget.,43,,
282,0.97,1664.596,1666.898,I think that is accurate.,44,,
283,0.97,1666.898,1669.434,"I mean, we try to rush to amend that.",44,,
284,0.97,1669.434,1675.707,But I don't think they will be necessary.,44,,
285,0.97,1675.707,1681.846,We'll have an opportunity to take it up afterwards.,44,,
286,0.97,1681.846,1682.847,We can work that out.,44,,
287,0.97,1682.847,1688.787,"Great, just wanted to get a sense of that in terms of process.",45,,
288,0.97,1688.787,1689.087,Thank you.,45,,

296,0.97,1718.917,1722.32,"This has resulted in staffing, in changing to staffing plans throughout the Department.",46,,
297,0.97,1722.32,1732.263,"As before, we were able to mitigate that.",46,,
298,0.97,1732.263,1738.236,These revenues exist in the general fund.,46,,
299,0.97,1738.236,1745.71,This reflects the net decrease for the appropriations of those projects result of the projected decline revenues.,46,,

353,0.97,2110.074,2115.813,We would have to look for other ways to continue that work.,54,,
354,0.97,2115.813,2127.725,"Including, I mean, there's other ways for us to do that through our existing Department overhead or other ways to potentially accomplish that.",54,,
355,0.97,2127.725,2139.103,That remains a core priority and value of ours supporting that equity group.,54,,
356,0.97,2139.103,2140.037,Working Collaboratively with the agenda.,54,,
357,0.97,2140.037,2149.18,I think the work of that group continues to be an important priority.,54,,
358,0.97,2149.18,2149.514,Thank you.,55,,
359,0.97,2149.514,2157.555,Did you have anything you wanted to add to that?,55,,
360,0.97,2157.555,2162.56,It's not really a swap.,56,,
361,0.97,2162.56,2171.435,"It is just being very clear, we will do all the other things first.",56,,
362,0.97,2171.435,2172.57,I would go to Sdot.,56,,
363,0.97,2172.57,2175.406,"But, you raise a good point.",56,,
364,0.97,2175.406,2176.641,Director Zimbabwe described it.,56,,
365,0.97,2176.641,2184.015,"If the revenues don't emerge, and we wanted to pursue the work, we would have to consider how to Reprioritize.",56,,
366,0.97,2184.015,2185.683,Thank you very much.,57,,
367,0.97,2185.683,2186.05,Both directors.,57,,
368,0.97,2186.05,2191.689,Let's go ahead and move on.,57,,
369,0.97,2191.689,2192.156,Thank you.,58,,
370,0.97,2192.156,2196.394,"Item number 7, the move Seattle levy portfolio.",59,,
371,0.97,2196.394,2206.771,We are pleased that move Seattle levy property tax proceeds remain relatively stable this year and are projected to remain so in 2021.,59,,
372,0.97,2206.771,2216.981,"But, local funds within the 2021 move Seattle levy portfolio have been reduced, reflecting reduced revenue projections for Sdot across the board.",59,,
373,0.97,2216.981,2219.383,This slide shows the year to year change.,59,,
374,0.97,2219.383,2228.125,"And, so, it essentially shows the changes in local funds.",59,,
375,0.97,2228.125,2235.233,The next two slides show the move Seattle budget for the remaining four years of the levy.,59,,
376,0.97,2235.233,2243.874,"For 2021, through 2024, local funds are reduced from the portfolio by a total of $71.6 million.",59,,
377,0.97,2243.874,2244.442,Projected at this point.,59,,
378,0.97,2244.442,2249.747,We'll get to that in more detail in a few minutes.,59,,
379,0.97,2249.747,2271.168,"Although, the change is a significant reduction, we have been able to mitigate impacts to staff by implementing hiring freeze, Reallocating staff to other programs and projects and by bringing additional work in House rather than using outside vendors.",59,,
380,0.97,2271.168,2276.941,Item number eight.,59,,
381,0.97,2276.941,2277.375,Bridge maintenance.,59,,
382,0.97,2277.375,2283.381,This refers to ongoing bridge maintenance activities in Sdot's budget.,59,,
383,0.97,2283.381,2291.188,We wanted to call out our investment in this important work is unchanged.,59,,
384,0.97,2291.188,2298.963,Except for a small inflationary increase.,59,,
385,0.97,2298.963,2300.998,"And finally, item number 9.",59,,
386,0.97,2300.998,2315.212,This slide shows the additional funding needed to support the Madison Street bus rapid transit project or Brt also known as the rapid ride G line in 2021.,59,,
387,0.97,2315.212,2319.483,This Council approved an updated CIP and funding plan from Madison Brt.,59,,
388,0.97,2319.483,2327.458,The sound transit board of directors approved the city's funding agreement with sound transit for the project.,59,,
389,0.97,2327.458,2337.101,"Finally, Sdot has completed the remaining elements needed to receive a small starts grant.",59,,
390,0.97,2337.101,2343.641,The project is anticipated to begin construction in 2021.,59,,
391,0.97,2343.641,2350.815,Are there any questions on this slide?,59,,
392,0.97,2350.815,2351.615,Not seeing any hands.,60,,
393,0.97,2351.615,2356.353,I do want to ask on item number 7 with the move Seattle levy.,60,,
394,0.97,2356.353,2361.692,"When we see a 69% reduction, it is very concerning.",60,,
395,0.97,2361.692,2369.033,I understand that it reflects the reality of the revenue projections for that specific levy.,60,,
396,0.97,2369.033,2385.483,"Is there any chance these projections were done, three, four weeks ago, and given the news at the state level that we can anticipate less dire projections since the state revenue forecast is slightly better than anticipated?",60,,
397,0.97,2385.483,2394.391,I know director Neville spoke to our overall projections for the city since we are largely dependent on Regressive strains.,60,,
398,0.97,2394.391,2397.027,"But, specific the move Seattle levy, any hope there?",60,,
399,0.97,2397.027,2399.396,"Well, there is always hope.",61,,
400,0.97,2399.396,2405.469,"I will let Sam respond to your question, but I will point out, yes, you are correct.",61,,
401,0.97,2405.469,2410.708,This budget proposal was developed over the course of the summer.,61,,
402,0.97,2410.708,2414.178,And was finalized really in August and in September.,61,,
403,0.97,2414.178,2429.26,And so all the numbers that you see are about our projected revenues are from a particular point in time.,61,,
404,0.97,2429.26,2439.303,I will take a few Swipes at that and let director noble respond.,62,,
405,0.97,2439.303,2444.608,Just one thing to clarify here.,62,,
406,0.97,2444.608,2449.48,The Nonlevy local dollars that go into the program.,62,,
407,0.97,2449.48,2459.523,"And H levy dollars themselves, leverage, local dollars as well as other grant funding sources to comprise the whole of the levy program.",62,,
408,0.97,2459.523,2470.568,"So, this 59% represents the reduction in the levy dollars a part of the anticipated program in 2021.",62,,
409,0.97,2470.568,2475.072,From the 2020 adopted.,62,,
410,0.97,2475.072,2476.307,It is a significnt impact.,62,,
411,0.97,2476.307,2487.885,"And it might actually be good to transition here, I can come back, this shows the 21-24 through the remaining life of the levy.",62,,
412,0.97,2487.885,2489.587,The overall impact we anticipate.,62,,
413,0.97,2489.587,2497.161,Which maybe is a little less dire than is shown from that 59% reduction there.,62,,
414,0.97,2497.161,2511.809,We do anticipate a little bit more $60.7 million of the overall levy program to be reduced over the course of a four year period.,62,,
415,0.97,2511.809,2526.79,"And what we have done is to, show the reductions in the context of the three levy categories.",62,,
416,0.97,2526.79,2527.124,Safe routes.,62,,
417,0.97,2527.124,2528.025,"Maintenance, repair, congestion relief.",62,,
418,0.97,2528.025,2535.299,"The following slide, this one here shows those as a portion of the dollars that make up part of the levy.",62,,
419,0.97,2535.299,2540.404,"So, we have the levy dollars at the bottom.",62,,
420,0.97,2540.404,2541.539,Those remain consistent.,62,,
421,0.97,2541.539,2542.74,Those are the baseline funds.,62,,
422,0.97,2542.74,2545.342,We have not seen a substantial change in the projections there.,62,,
423,0.97,2545.342,2550.214,The light blue is the local funds.,62,,
424,0.97,2550.214,2559.423,"Those are the ones that have seen the most impact, a combination of different funding, the next is the leverage.",62,,
425,0.97,2559.423,2566.363,And you see a large portion of the purple growing.,62,,
426,0.97,2566.363,2574.672,"And, that is reflective of our grant funding sources to be determined.",62,,
427,0.97,2574.672,2575.572,Not to be considered.,62,,
428,0.97,2575.572,2584.982,We keep those as to be determined.,62,,
429,0.97,2584.982,2585.95,From baseline to proposed.,62,,
430,0.97,2585.95,2593.791,"So, overall, the impact on the levy program as a whole comes from the decline in those local sources.",62,,
431,0.97,2593.791,2607.905,"And, I think as if, recovery takes a different path than we have projected at this point, we can take steps to Reallocate those to the levy programs where we are taking reductions now.",62,,
432,0.97,2607.905,2612.876,"Director Zimbabwe, thank you for that.",63,,
433,0.97,2612.876,2613.377,Councilmember Pederson.,63,,
434,0.97,2613.377,2617.081,I'm not sure you had other things to add.,63,,
435,0.97,2617.081,2625.089,I jumped to the conclusion it was related to a reduction in levy funds but you pointed out this is Nonlevy funds and your slide says that.,63,,
436,0.97,2625.089,2640.404,So if it is coming from other local funds does that mean it is more of a policy choice?,63,,
437,0.97,2640.404,2657.988,"I was going to say, you know, the levy program as a whole goes to take the levy dollars and puts in the local funds to deliver on the overall program.",64,,
438,0.97,2657.988,2670.367,"So, as the local funds, funding the revenues, the projections go down, we have taken, you know, we are taking the reductions in the overall program.",64,,
439,0.97,2670.367,2687.317,There is a policy decision and something that is in the proposed budget is to bring forward some of the dollars that we anticipate later in the levy to minimize the short term impact of some of these local dollar reductions.,64,,
440,0.97,2687.317,2705.202,"And so, because the levy is a stable funding source and we have some resources we anticipate coming through for projects that have not yet begun anticipated for later.",64,,
441,0.97,2705.202,2733.797,"Pulling those resources forward into 2021, that will help us keep the levy program moving at the same speed it was moving at roughly while we see what happens into the future with our revenues.",64,,
442,0.97,2735.666,2736.4,Thank you.,65,,
443,0.97,2736.4,2741.038,"I will move on, and again, happy to answer questions on any part of the budget.",66,,
444,0.97,2741.038,2750.481,"But one thing we wanted to touch on is how the Department, I addressed in some of the opening remarks but how our Department budget addresses racial equity.",66,,
445,0.97,2750.481,2757.054,"As I said before, as a city and as a Department, we have Underinvested in many of our communities.",66,,
446,0.97,2757.054,2760.457,And the black lives matter movement.,66,,
447,0.97,2760.457,2763.794,The impacts of a health and economic perspective.,66,,
448,0.97,2763.794,2774.705,It means we have to take an equity lens to all of our budget decisions and we are keenly aware of the decisions we make directly impact racial equity internally and in the communities we serve.,66,,
449,0.97,2774.705,2783.113,We have been mindful in our proposals to Minimalize the direct impacts to the vulnerable communities with our project pauses in particular.,66,,
450,0.97,2783.113,2786.55,I'm looking at where those projects are.,66,,
451,0.97,2786.55,2807.804,"We have chosen to, where it is possible to pause larger discreet capital projects so that we are able to deliver on program work that has a far reaching and positive impact on all Seattle communities but enables us to focus.",66,,
452,0.97,2807.804,2810.44,We do program level analyses to determine.,66,,
453,0.97,2810.44,2820.517,"And our modal plans for people walking, rolling, Biking, taking transit.",66,,
454,0.97,2820.517,2822.786,"And delivering freight, supporting equitable Prioritization.",66,,
455,0.97,2822.786,2838.769,"We Anty Pat as Sdot engages with communities around transportation needs in the post Covid recovery process, we will be able to further refine our priorities and investments.",66,,
456,0.97,2838.769,2842.606,That is something we are engaging with the levy oversight committee right now.,66,,
457,0.97,2842.606,2849.98,There are some impacts to the proposed budget.,66,,
458,0.97,2849.98,2851.248,Potential impact to community users.,66,,
459,0.97,2851.248,2856.353,Capital projects to build out our infrastructure and reductions to service levels.,66,,
460,0.97,2856.353,2864.928,Transportation services could reduce the opportunities for various communities and travelers to keep or gain better access to safer transportation mode city wide.,66,,
461,0.97,2864.928,2870.934,"And, these resources can be focused on geographic locations with a social justice lens.",66,,
462,0.97,2870.934,2879.476,And impacts overall could likely further affect those who have traditionally been undeserved.,66,,
463,0.97,2879.476,2891.255,People travel across the city and those impacts tend to fall disproportionately on the community.,66,,
464,0.97,2891.255,2898.862,Utilizing women and minority own business enterprises is one f the ways Sdot and the city Prioritize our commitment to equity.,66,,
465,0.97,2898.862,2906.403,I just got an update on our progress toward our goals we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year.,66,,
466,0.97,2906.403,2929.159,"We set a 34% rate for consulting, through the end of August, we had, we were slightly exceeding our consulting goal with 36.7 of our spending going to our firms.",66,,
467,0.97,2929.159,2932.562,We take a racial equity look at that as well.,66,,
468,0.97,2932.562,2938.535,We know we need to deepen the racial equity proportion of that.,66,,
469,0.97,2938.535,2944.308,We do very well with our women owned businesses and struggle more with minority owned businesses.,66,,
470,0.97,2944.308,2958.622,"As we pause or reduce some capital asset repair projects, those could reduce opportunities for contractors who participate in project delivery.",66,,
471,0.97,2958.622,2959.389,"Engagement, design, construction.",66,,
472,0.97,2959.389,2980.61,"A downstream effect of our efforts to preserve the work force diversity could mean as we shift capital project work to Sdot staff and crews, we could have some of those impacts.",66,,
473,0.97,2980.61,2996.36,"We have some potential impact to our city wide capacity for planning and racial equity analysis as we look at the resources needed for planning, data gathering analysis, policy, legislative support.",66,,
474,0.97,2996.36,2997.194,"And, environmental impact analysis.",66,,
475,0.97,2997.194,3008.438,We think those can be mitigated but those are places where some of the reductions overall and how we need to implement those and keep some of our investment work going.,66,,
476,0.97,3008.438,3017.18,We are very mindful about not hampering our long term ability to advance those critical priorities as well.,66,,
477,0.97,3017.18,3022.819,"Then, we have managed to minimize the impact internally to our staffing levels.",66,,
478,0.97,3022.819,3030.293,"But, we still need to take action as a Department to attract and retain a diverse and inclusive work force.",66,,
479,0.97,3030.293,3050.047,There's a number of things we have done and continue to do across the Department for our diversity equity inclusion advancement and building the diversity of our team as a whole.,66,,
480,0.97,3050.047,3058.855,I will talk briefly about our support of small businesses and a lot we have done over the Covid response and a lot we anticipate happening this year into next year.,66,,
481,0.97,3058.855,3067.23,We have streamlined our tools to be nimble and innovative and helped our Seattle businesses survive.,66,,
482,0.97,3067.23,3072.302,"On March 17, early on in the pandemic, we launched food priority pick up.",66,,
483,0.97,3072.302,3075.806,And we have them at 531 locations.,66,,
484,0.97,3075.806,3081.878,"In May, we launch the curb side priority pickup zones for retail.",66,,
485,0.97,3081.878,3086.283,We made those easy for businesses to request and for us to deploy.,66,,
486,0.97,3086.283,3097.394,"When the stay home stay healthy orders were lifted in June, we started offering free six month permits for curb side and sidewalk uses.",66,,
487,0.97,3097.394,3099.196,We have approved 140 permits.,66,,
488,0.97,3099.196,3099.629,More under review.,66,,
489,0.97,3099.629,3101.498,A lot of those are focused on food.,66,,
490,0.97,3101.498,3108.572,And you can see one in the picture here in the background there.,66,,
491,0.97,3108.572,3109.172,That is Island time.,66,,
492,0.97,3109.172,3114.277,Island soul Street cafe in Columbia city.,66,,
493,0.97,3114.277,3128.325,"In August, the Seattle together streets program began temporarily closing blocks and providing signs, tables, and chairs to support Takeout.",66,,
494,0.97,3128.325,3135.398,"Soon in the Cid, for a mural installation.",66,,
495,0.97,3135.398,3145.842,"And, we have linked these block closures to our stay healthy streets and worked in partnership with some of the communities to be able to take advantage of this asset as well.",66,,
496,0.97,3145.842,3154.751,"We have made in an effort to make our programs more accessible, this information is available in multiple languages.",66,,
497,0.97,3154.751,3160.19,We are doing phone consultations with businesses to support in their applications.,66,,
498,0.97,3160.19,3170.267,Last thing we partnered with Oad to support the small business grants process they have been administering over the course of this year.,66,,
499,0.97,3170.267,3175.839,That brings us to the end of the presentation as a whole.,67,,
500,0.97,3175.839,3179.042,Happy to take any more questions.,67,,
501,0.97,3179.042,3183.213,Thank you director Zimbabwe and Kris for your presentation as well.,68,,
502,0.97,3183.213,3200.697,"I know in the last slide, there was a lot of enthusiasm for the street walk sidewalks and street vacancies to go into effect.",68,,

504,0.97,3201.464,3202.332,I have a comment.,69,,

511,0.97,3219.015,3220.417,Careful out there!,74,,
512,0.97,3220.417,3220.75,[Laughter],74,,
513,0.97,3220.75,3227.29,I am not sure that was aimed at me.,75,,
514,0.97,3227.29,3230.894,I know what a crutch every Department in the city is in.,75,,
515,0.97,3230.894,3242.672,"Particularly yours, SOY appreciate the hard decisions you have having to make about projects and programs.",75,,
516,0.97,3242.672,3255.852,And I do want to say particularly when we are talking about racial equity and the ability of our community members who have disabilities to get around.,75,,
517,0.97,3255.852,3267.897,"It is really hard to see that so much of our, you know, pedestrian and bike infrastructure plans have been cut.",75,,
518,0.97,3267.897,3290.02,"And so, I do want to mention that as you were saying, if there is any future opportunity to increase those investments, particularly if we are talking about the climate impact, the health impact, that not having alternative modes easily accessible to people.",75,,
519,0.97,3290.02,3294.257,"You know, all these things are connected and tied together.",75,,
520,0.97,3294.257,3299.929,"And so, I think it is smart investment to be making in our neighbors for all kinds of reasons.",75,,
521,0.97,3299.929,3314.744,"And, would love to talk with you and be in touch about how we can make some adjustments as soon as we know about resources that are available.",75,,
522,0.97,3314.744,3318.448,Thank you Councilmember.,76,,
523,0.97,3318.448,3319.282,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,77,,
524,0.97,3319.282,3325.121,"I'm not sure about the location, but perhaps we need a street diet where you are at.",77,,
525,0.97,3325.121,3331.561,To slow down that traffic.,77,,
526,0.97,3331.561,3333.096,Councilmember Strauss?,77,,
527,0.97,3333.096,3334.998,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,78,,
528,0.97,3334.998,3342.939,I'm very appreciative of the work Sdot and the executive's office has done to create cafe streets.,78,,
529,0.97,3342.939,3349.879,Seattle together streets and the use of our rights of way Fortous be able to physically distance.,78,,
530,0.97,3349.879,3352.549,"And, also, benefit the economy.",78,,
531,0.97,3352.549,3362.559,"I know that the cafe streets and the sidewalk, the extended sidewalk cafe permits were rolled out more than halfway through the summer.",78,,
532,0.97,3362.559,3368.531,I wonder do we have plans in place for this program to be extended into the winter?,78,,
533,0.97,3368.531,3378.508,"And, if there are specific policy parameters that we will be putting in place to assist folks dealing with the wintertime months?",78,,
534,0.97,3378.508,3380.71,"Whether it is heaters, tents.",78,,
535,0.97,3380.71,3393.59,"I know currently, businesses have to roll all of their belongings back into their store at the end of the night.",78,,
536,0.97,3393.59,3402.332,"And that can be more difficult as more implements are needed to protect people from rain, wind, cold, et cetera.",78,,
537,0.97,3402.332,3405.101,"And then, also, just flagging New York City has also done this.",78,,
538,0.97,3405.101,3412.108,There's a French cafe that uses bubbles.,78,,
539,0.97,3412.108,3415.545,If you haven't seen that article about people dining in bubbles.,78,,
540,0.97,3415.545,3418.948,I hope we can see something like that as well.,78,,
541,0.97,3418.948,3419.315,Absolutely.,79,,
542,0.97,3419.315,3423.019,I think those are the great questions.,79,,
543,0.97,3423.019,3429.392,"And, we are working to address those as quickly as we can.",79,,
544,0.97,3429.392,3434.497,"And so, you know, every business is slightly different.",79,,
545,0.97,3434.497,3435.765,"And, every business has slightly different needs.",79,,
546,0.97,3435.765,3445.375,One of the things that was successful about the Rollout of our existing program is that we have been able to support businesses through that process.,79,,
547,0.97,3445.375,3455.151,"And, you know, not have them try to sort of find the right rock and show it to us.",79,,
548,0.97,3455.151,3456.352,But coach them through the process.,79,,
549,0.97,3456.352,3471.301,"As we get to overhead protection and heaters, that's a place where we want to give really clear direction so that businesses are not investing in things that end up not being approve able.",79,,
550,0.97,3471.301,3477.173,We have also learned the last month or so how people are using the street and how we can continue to help support it.,79,,
551,0.97,3477.173,3487.951,And one of the places where we definitely have heard the feedback is that some people do want to bring their things in overnight and some people don't.,79,,
552,0.97,3487.951,3496.226,And how we can help people continue to use the right of way.,79,,
553,0.97,3496.226,3500.163,The weather is pretty decent but it starts raining and getting colder in October.,79,,
554,0.97,3500.163,3509.038,So there is some urgency in getting these issues resolved.,79,,
555,0.97,3509.038,3509.706,Thank you very much.,80,,
556,0.97,3509.706,3514.711,I have a question on this slide as well.,80,,
557,0.97,3514.711,3529.826,"For programming and response to Covid such as the healthy streets or the street sidewalks, can you speak to the sites, the locations, the equity analysis that goes into this.",80,,
558,0.97,3529.826,3539.402,"And then, we didn't talk a ton about the healthy streets but they were rolled out in neighborhood Greenways.",80,,
559,0.97,3539.402,3545.909,Which really I think limited the success of Prioritizing neighborhoods of color and those who needed traffic calming measures.,80,,
560,0.97,3545.909,3550.213,And we had a disparity in terms of where the Greenways and traffic calming areas are.,80,,
561,0.97,3550.213,3563.493,Can you talk about any other efforts that you are working onto expand beyond our existing model of using Greenways?,80,,
562,0.97,3563.493,3569.832,To try to make sure we are using more flexible design strategies.,80,,
563,0.97,3569.832,3574.037,The concept on the images is a place to exercise while we were in the midst of Covid.,80,,
564,0.97,3574.037,3590.553,But a lot of folks are using those areas as safer places to ride their bikes tour walk to places of business.,80,,
565,0.97,3590.553,3593.89,Can you talk about expanding beyond the existing healthy Street program?,80,,
566,0.97,3593.89,3597.594,Those are great questions.,81,,
567,0.97,3597.594,3604.1,"So, the existing programs I believe we are now at 27 miles of stay healthy streets across the city.",81,,
568,0.97,3604.1,3611.874,We did take an equity lens in identifying those neighborhood Greenways.,81,,
569,0.97,3611.874,3613.242,That we would upgrade to those.,81,,
570,0.97,3613.242,3620.416,And find places that were Underserved from other sort of recreation or neighborhood access perspective.,81,,
571,0.97,3620.416,3643.239,"One piece of feedback that we did get early on in the program is that the street closed language which is necessary because of, to allow pedestrians to walk in the street, we have to call the street closed.",81,,
572,0.97,3643.239,3645.041,Felt Exclusionary.,81,,
573,0.97,3645.041,3650.646,And in places that are experiencing Gentrification.,81,,
574,0.97,3650.646,3659.022,People felt they had experiences of being asked why they were on that block in a car.,81,,
575,0.97,3659.022,3670.767,"And so, in some communities, it had the potential to create some of the things that were converse to what our intention was.",81,,
576,0.97,3670.767,3687.95,"What it might mean to make the investments permanent and create the safe walking and Biking environment, we wanted to be really intentional about how we engage with community ad don't end up with unintended consequences.",81,,
577,0.97,3687.95,3694.057,"In terms of expanding those, we continue to make Greenway investments.",81,,
578,0.97,3694.057,3702.632,"We continue Toic to expand, we implemented the home zones.",81,,
579,0.97,3702.632,3715.378,"And, so, I think it is incumbent upon us to continue to work with communities through this and figure out how we maintain access and improve safety for people walking and Biking.",81,,
580,0.97,3715.378,3718.347,As patterns of movement have also shifted radically.,81,,
581,0.97,3718.347,3726.289,So people are trying to get to and from their local neighborhoods walking and Biking.,81,,
582,0.97,3726.289,3733.663,The commute downtown might be less important for some people in some parts of the city as well.,81,,
583,0.97,3733.663,3734.564,Thank you very much.,82,,
584,0.97,3734.564,3734.964,That's helpful.,82,,
585,0.97,3734.964,3742.004,A similar line of questioning for our slide five.,82,,
586,0.97,3742.004,3748.01,We are dealing with the reality of having to make tough decisions right now.,82,,
587,0.97,3748.01,3750.446,Absent all of the revenue that we need.,82,,
588,0.97,3750.446,3765.795,"But, can you describe for us the process that went into identifying which projects within the move Seattle portfolio would move forward and which ones would be put on hold?",82,,
589,0.97,3765.795,3780.143,"How did those projects get identified, which stake holders were at the table and was there some sort of weight given to the vision zero projects or the climate priority projects.",82,,
590,0.97,3780.143,3781.577,That's another great question.,83,,
591,0.97,3781.577,3801.297,"So, I talked a little bit early on about some of the value framework that we put in place to guide our approach to the overall budget and had applied to the proposals on the levy program in particular.",83,,
592,0.97,3801.297,3811.174,Those were about equity center recovery process.,83,,
593,0.97,3811.174,3817.48,Maintaining our staff capacity for rapid recovery efforts.,83,,
594,0.97,3817.48,3822.485,Addressing our safety and infrastructure challenges.,83,,
595,0.97,3822.485,3831.194,"The climate change piece, maximizing our Federal and state funding opportunities.",83,,
596,0.97,3831.194,3841.37,"And then, Becausing discreet projects to direct resources and investments so places we might be helpful in terms of recovery or maybe smaller scale changes.",83,,
597,0.97,3841.37,3847.043,"We also within this levy program, this is the four year look at the budget.",83,,
598,0.97,3847.043,3853.816,Had to look at the timing of when projects or programs will be ready for investment.,83,,
599,0.97,3853.816,3873.669,"So, this really boils down a lot of that complexity into some changes at the high move Seattle levy categories on Tuesday, we will go into a lot more detail with the levy oversight committee.",83,,
600,0.97,3873.669,3880.009,That talks about how these changes affect individual programs within the levy.,83,,
601,0.97,3880.009,3887.216,"There's 30, 31 discreet programs within these three big categories.",83,,
602,0.97,3887.216,3890.853,That also feeds into our levy assessment process.,83,,
603,0.97,3890.853,3897.36,We have had to do this in these rapidly changing revenue projections.,83,,
604,0.97,3897.36,3899.896,"An again, the local dollars that support the larger program.",83,,
605,0.97,3899.896,3913.342,There is an opportunity working in partnership with the levy oversight committee and our work group where we can see if those are the right proposals we have made.,83,,
606,0.97,3913.342,3926.455,Some of those may need to come back to the Council for if there's larger changes in allocations across these move Seattle levy categories.,83,,
607,0.97,3926.455,3931.227,Some of them have to go to the levy oversight committee.,83,,
608,0.97,3931.227,3939.802,We are happy to stay engaged can the utilities committee as we move forward.,83,,
609,0.97,3939.802,3943.706,"Thank you very much, we will look forward to more on that Tuesday.",84,,
610,0.97,3943.706,3962.258,"I'm not seeing any additional hands or messages here from folks who have questions at this point, director Zimbabwe, we know there will be more questions in the future as this is a huge component of not just the budget, but the values and the priorities of this Council.",84,,
611,0.97,3962.258,3968.965,To make sure we have safe infrastructure.,84,,
612,0.97,3968.965,3970.7,"Councilmember Pederson, any closing comments from you?",84,,
613,0.97,3970.7,3975.871,"Thank you, no, I have no further comments at this time.",85,,
614,0.97,3975.871,3976.372,Director Zimbabwe?,86,,
615,0.97,3976.372,3977.873,I think I have spoken enough.,87,,
616,0.97,3977.873,3979.342,Thank you very much.,87,,
617,0.97,3979.342,3980.042,Thank you.,88,,
618,0.97,3980.042,3981.077,"Thanks again, Kris.",88,,
619,0.97,3981.077,3987.75,And pass on our appreciation to your team for working on this presentation for us and all the work that went into correcting the budget on your end this summer.,88,,
620,0.97,3987.75,3991.32,I think a few of them are watching so thank you for thanking them as well.,89,,
621,0.97,3991.32,3992.888,Have a good weekend.,90,,
622,0.97,3992.888,3993.289,Appreciate it.,90,,

628,0.97,4003.632,4019.215,"And, as I spoke to Councilmember Juareg about saving the best for last, director Aguirre.",94,,
629,0.97,4019.215,4022.852,Agenda number 4. Seattle parks and recreation for briefing and discussion.,95,,
630,0.97,4022.852,4023.519,Wonderful.,96,,

634,0.97,4041.103,4049.145,I appreciate you being with us as well on this last presentation.,96,,
635,0.97,4049.145,4053.716,"Before we begin, Councilmember Juarez, you are the proud chair in the committee with parks an recreation.",96,,
636,0.97,4053.716,4055.484,Would you like to say some opening comments?,96,,
637,0.97,4055.484,4060.356,"Yes, I have a few, thank you Madame chair.",97,,
638,0.97,4060.356,4062.491,Is Tracy with us as well from central staff?,97,,

641,0.97,4066.095,4067.73,"Well, thank you Madame chair.",99,,
642,0.97,4067.73,4087.883,"Because, we have this really wonderful consistent and continued communication with the superintendent, a lot of what he will share today isn't going to be completely new except for some of the specific numbers.",99,,
643,0.97,4087.883,4092.088,We had a chance to go through the power point.,99,,
644,0.97,4092.088,4114.343,"What we were looking at for our colleague to pay particular attention to, is the emphasis on the ads, the reductions, and the Cost-Saving measures on number one, the operating budget which I believe is slide six and has about nine areas that we have spoken to since we have been in quarantine Lockdown.",99,,
645,0.97,4114.343,4118.047,"And, the issues and, the weekly reports we have been given.",99,,
646,0.97,4118.047,4121.75,"And then, the capital budget which is slide eight.",99,,
647,0.97,4121.75,4122.084,Eight areas.,99,,
648,0.97,4122.084,4130.659,"So in regards to that, what we were focused on was the general fund.",99,,
649,0.97,4130.659,4133.095,"In particular, the metropolitan parks district.",99,,
650,0.97,4133.095,4138.734,"As you know, the Mpd governing board is also the Seattle city council.",99,,
651,0.97,4138.734,4142.204,I ay have comments on that when we get to slide 10 and 11.,99,,
652,0.97,4142.204,4150.713,My particular interest and I'm sure the superintendent will address it is the general Fund and Mpd realignment.,99,,
653,0.97,4150.713,4156.118,The Park Fund and the Mpd realignment.,99,,
654,0.97,4156.118,4175.938,"I do want to add on a personal note, in addition, it is important for this body to remember due to the unprecedented emergency, we have reduced our financial commitment to Seattle parks and recreation below previous commitments and levels as every Department across the boards have.",99,,
655,0.97,4175.938,4180.976,"As resources bounce back, we need to honor those commitments.",99,,
656,0.97,4180.976,4195.357,We received many Emails and comments about people concerned about how we are going to maintain previous commitments.,99,,
657,0.97,4195.357,4202.298,"Finally, I want to appreciate the focus and seriousness and being equity centers.",99,,
658,0.97,4202.298,4212.741,"As chair of the parks Committee, I have witnessed the attention to detail when providing services to our vulnerable population in our city, especially Covid.",99,,
659,0.97,4212.741,4216.946,"When we needed free child care for essential workers, the city was there.",99,,
660,0.97,4216.946,4224.42,"When we needed space, parks set up their community centers immediately.",99,,
661,0.97,4224.42,4228.49,Particularly to offer services for the unsheltered.,99,,
662,0.97,4228.49,4236.865,My weekly meetings with the superintendent have been helpful to track and stay up to date with park activity to keep our facilities safe and accessible.,99,,
663,0.97,4236.865,4242.571,I look forward to the superintendent's presentation and comments and questions from my colleagues.,99,,
664,0.97,4242.571,4249.845,"Just briefly, I may have some comments in regards to the October 19th public hearing that we will have.",99,,
665,0.97,4249.845,4265.828,"And of course, the November 23rd metropolitan park district meeting to see how that what the voters pass I believe in 2014.",99,,
666,0.97,4265.828,4274.003,"With that, I will turn it over to superintendent Aguirre.",99,,
667,0.97,4274.003,4276.305,Thank you Councilmember Juarez for your support.,100,,

670,0.97,4283.946,4284.88,But there are folks tired.,100,,
671,0.97,4284.88,4287.116,So I will try to go through quickly.,100,,
672,0.97,4287.116,4295.891,But there's a lot of information here and I want to make sure I'm able to answer questions and try to provide you with an overview.,100,,
673,0.97,4295.891,4297.226,So I really appreciate the time.,100,,
674,0.97,4297.226,4301.03,We will talk about the Mayor's proposed budget.,100,,
675,0.97,4301.03,4304.433,But I want to talk a little about our 2020 budget.,100,,
676,0.97,4304.433,4318.914,"Because, on Tuesday, as the Mayor submitted her 2021 budget, we also sent to you, some additional changes to our 2020 budget related to additional revenue challenges with our park Fund.",100,,
677,0.97,4318.914,4329.992,"Before I jump in, I want to mention on the caller on this virtual table, we have Michelle Finnegan who oversees the development of the budget as well as Amy Williams.",100,,
678,0.97,4329.992,4338.701,"She and her team do all of the work behind, in front of, below, the scene to make sure these numbers add up.",100,,
679,0.97,4338.701,4346.208,Soily go ahead and jump in to the slides here.,100,,
680,0.97,4346.208,4353.015,"As the Councilmember stated, we have been doing work very different this year as in previous years.",100,,
681,0.97,4353.015,4366.028,Some of you may recall that parks and recreation started our year really at the precipice of an exciting time.,100,,
682,0.97,4366.028,4377.806,We adopted a strategic plan for the next six or seven years and we were about to kick off a financial plan for the park district.,100,,
683,0.97,4377.806,4381.377,We had held our public meeting before the governor's stay home order.,100,,
684,0.97,4381.377,4388.317,Not to go again into the detail of what 2020 has brought us.,100,,
685,0.97,4388.317,4396.525,"The pandemic, the several rights reckoning.",100,,
686,0.97,4396.525,4400.562,And even infrastructure reckoning.,100,,
687,0.97,4400.562,4405.1,Like other agencies we would be jumped into this Covid response.,100,,
688,0.97,4405.1,4406.135,We Pivoted our operations.,100,,
689,0.97,4406.135,4416.311,"And so, in support of the human services Department, we set up shelters in three of our community centers to support our homeless population.",100,,
690,0.97,4416.311,4423.652,We also opened up five free shower sites to provide that service to folks.,100,,
691,0.97,4423.652,4433.429,We set up child care for folks and continue do that.,100,,
692,0.97,4433.429,4437.299,We did it in the spring and summer and continue to do it now.,100,,
693,0.97,4437.299,4441.837,We continue to ensure all of our outdoor comfort stations are open.,100,,
694,0.97,4441.837,4442.137,And clean.,100,,
695,0.97,4442.137,4444.64,And we continue to clean them on an enhanced level.,100,,
696,0.97,4444.64,4448.31,"And then of course, we were really focused on keeping our parks open.",100,,
697,0.97,4448.31,4464.66,"Recognizing that parks and open space and green space is really critical for our communities, especially when we are all locked down and it is incredibly important for our physical and mental well being.",100,,
698,0.97,4464.66,4470.966,Our seniors who from the very beginning were not able to come out of their homes.,100,,
699,0.97,4470.966,4478.373,So we did a lot of virtual programming for those folks mostly high impacted by the pandemic.,100,,
700,0.97,4478.373,4489.384,"And, it is also important to note that much of this work was done with a significantly diminished team.",100,,
701,0.97,4489.384,4495.023,We had almost 100 staff members that were not able to come to work because they were in high risk categories.,100,,
702,0.97,4495.023,4507.936,"And, I would be Remiss in not taking advantage of a quick opportunity to really think the team, the Seattle park and recreation employees who every day in such difficult situations step up and do the things that I talked about.",100,,
703,0.97,4507.936,4509.471,But just generally keep our system going.,100,,
704,0.97,4509.471,4511.039,And they do that each and every day.,100,,
705,0.97,4511.039,4515.244,So I'm proud to be a part of this team.,100,,
706,0.97,4515.244,4529.258,"So, we did this, you know, we provided these critical services and had to begin to address this significant gaps, particularly with our park Fund.",100,,
707,0.97,4529.258,4537.799,This is in terms of 2020 additional information you are getting.,100,,
708,0.97,4537.799,4543.338,"Just, to sort of quickly give you an overview.",100,,
709,0.97,4543.338,4555.25,"20% of our budget is a park fund presented from fees, charges for programs and rentals.",100,,
710,0.97,4555.25,4556.852,17% of our budget is reaped.,100,,
711,0.97,4556.852,4570.165,This park district has been an incredibly flexible source of funding that has allowed us to weather what our tremendous revenue and funding gaps.,100,,
712,0.97,4570.165,4578.54,"Again, as we did in 2020, the revised budget you acted on recently, we did the same thing for the second package.",100,,
713,0.97,4578.54,4587.549,That are specific to this revenue loss for the parks Fund.,100,,
714,0.97,4587.549,4591.42,"Similarly, we really relied on the park district.",100,,
715,0.97,4591.42,4595.324,I'll go into those details here.,100,,
716,0.97,4595.324,4595.624,Okay.,101,,
717,0.97,4595.624,4605.834,"So, more specifically, again, this is our 2020 rebalancing of the park Fund.",101,,
718,0.97,4605.834,4610.605,Our budget for 2020 originally assumed about $40 million.,101,,
719,0.97,4610.605,4617.412,"Because of the impact of Covid- 19, we are estimating a significant shortfall there to the tune of $19.2 million.",101,,
720,0.97,4617.412,4626.822,"Much of our work is bringing people together, creating activities for folks.",101,,
721,0.97,4626.822,4627.389,Permitting our facilities.,101,,
722,0.97,4627.389,4629.725,That came to a screeching halt in March.,101,,
723,0.97,4629.725,4647.643,"In addition to that, we provided hundreds of refunds to folks who had already reserved and paid for activities and we participated in the Mayor's initiative to support our small businesses and our own partners by providing rent waivers and deferrals for the folks in our buildings.",101,,
724,0.97,4647.643,4650.712,And really looking for other ways to support our partners.,101,,
725,0.97,4650.712,4652.481,So that revenue shortfall was pretty significant.,101,,
726,0.97,4652.481,4662.324,"Úas you can see by the chart here, the way we are proposing to address it is through some savings.",101,,
727,0.97,4662.324,4669.931,These vacancies I mentioned reducing our overall use of temporary labor and other Nonlabor Saverrings.,101,,
728,0.97,4669.931,4694.556,"Also, on the positive side of things, we received $2 million to support our social distance Ambassador Fund.",101,,
729,0.97,4694.556,4700.462,The remaining $6.9 million we are proposing to meet the gap with further park district re alignment.,101,,
730,0.97,4700.462,4703.832,Some vacancies in the park district.,101,,
731,0.97,4703.832,4711.206,Some reduction INS programming reduced for 2020 given the health restrictions that Covid is creating in terms of the groupings and things like that.,101,,
732,0.97,4711.206,4721.216,"And then, we are also proposing continuing to defer capital P projects.",101,,
733,0.97,4721.216,4723.685,I will call out a couple.,101,,
734,0.97,4723.685,4725.353,This supports our green Seattle partnership.,101,,
735,0.97,4725.353,4728.99,I know we will have more of an opportunity to talk about that with our budget.,101,,
736,0.97,4728.99,4739.468,We also submitted a statement of legislative intent to give you an update on where we are and some of the modifications we need to make.,101,,
737,0.97,4739.468,4747.843,I will ailing call out another one I think is important to raise.,101,,
738,0.97,4747.843,4760.822,"You will see here, the Smith Cove phase one project is being put on hold as part of this proposal and these are incredibly difficult.",101,,
739,0.97,4760.822,4768.697,We made these decisions in our capital reductions in line with our other land bank sites we put most of those on hold.,101,,
740,0.97,4768.697,4788.049,We did carve out a few that specifically serve Bpoc communities.,101,,
741,0.97,4788.049,4793.755,"And so, you know, noting these various programs, some of them have some funding remaining in them.",101,,
742,0.97,4793.755,4809.571,"So for example, the arts in the park, those are programs where we provide funds to community based organizations to create Úactivities to support our mission.",101,,
743,0.97,4809.571,4813.141,Those activities can't happen in the Covid pandemic.,101,,
744,0.97,4813.141,4815.844,Many of those were holding vacancies.,101,,
745,0.97,4815.844,4821.817,Many are activities that wouldn't be able to happen anyway.,101,,
746,0.97,4821.817,4824.419,So I can answer any specific questions on the slide.,101,,
747,0.97,4824.419,4826.087,And I can keep going.,101,,
748,0.97,4826.087,4827.756,I know folks are probably tired.,101,,
749,0.97,4827.756,4833.728,We are excited about parks!,102,,
750,0.97,4833.728,4834.095,Very excited.,102,,
751,0.97,4834.095,4839.367,And totally hope you are willing to engage with our questions here.,102,,
752,0.97,4839.367,4841.503,I see Councilmember Strauss and Councilmember Juarez.,102,,
753,0.97,4841.503,4842.537,Did you have a question?,102,,
754,0.97,4842.537,4844.439,"No, I'm just so excited about parks.",103,,
755,0.97,4844.439,4855.584,"Don't let the day or the time confuse you, we are more than enthusiastic about this.",104,,
756,0.97,4855.584,4857.752,"Councilmember Strauss, take it away.",105,,
757,0.97,4857.752,4859.254,"Superintendent, you summed it up well.",106,,
758,0.97,4859.254,4864.593,None of these are easy decisions in these tough times.,106,,
759,0.97,4864.593,4866.995,I so appreciate the tough choices you have had to make.,106,,
760,0.97,4866.995,4873.535,I hope you can tell us a little more about the saving our forests line item.,106,,
761,0.97,4873.535,4889.217,"And then, while I understand that we need to put Smith Cove back on pause, I will share with you, I still do have the photograph from I think it was Mayor Mcginn.",106,,
762,0.97,4889.217,4895.657,From so many years ago when the park was supposed to be started up.,106,,
763,0.97,4895.657,4902.764,I pledge to Youly continue to save this photograph until we take the next one.,106,,
764,0.97,4902.764,4904.633,And just understand it is a hard decision.,106,,
765,0.97,4904.633,4910.538,"I can't wait to take another photo, hopefully soon.",107,,
766,0.97,4910.538,4917.078,In terms of you question about saving our forest.,107,,
767,0.97,4917.078,4921.883,"So, the line item here is, save or forest funds our green Seattle partnership.",107,,
768,0.97,4921.883,4924.586,It is about restoring our urban forest.,107,,
769,0.97,4924.586,4931.192,There are both operating and capital costs associated with that.,107,,
770,0.97,4931.192,4938.8,What we are proposing here is just I think a couple of vacancies being held.,107,,
771,0.97,4938.8,4952.247,"As I mentioned at the beginning, our green Seattle partnership is at a point where we have learned a ton in the decade we have been working on it.",107,,
772,0.97,4952.247,4957.018,We have to Reimagine it a little bit to make sure it caches up with what we have learned on forest restoration.,107,,
773,0.97,4957.018,4964.559,What it costs to do these things.,107,,
774,0.97,4964.559,4979.474,"That doesn't in any way, shape, or form indicate that we don't remain absolutely committed to our urban forest as it supports a larger environmental Footprint here making sure we are doing our part to mitigate the climate change.",107,,
775,0.97,4979.474,4980.942,Thank you.,108,,
776,0.97,4980.942,4983.611,"As you know, I have a keen interest in our urban canopy.",108,,
777,0.97,4983.611,4995.056,"If there is anything I can do or if you want to put me to work on some trails, I had some forestry work in my past and I would be happy to join you.",108,,
778,0.97,4995.056,4997.592,Great to know that.,109,,
779,0.97,4997.592,4999.194,Thank you.,109,,
780,0.97,4999.194,5006.001,Than you.,110,,
781,0.97,5006.001,5007.068,Thank you.,110,,
782,0.97,5007.068,5017.479,"Superintendent, Aguirre, I wanted to ask you about the one time park fund expenditure savings.",111,,
783,0.97,5017.479,5024.285,"So it lists there, that is sort of is a savings from vacancies.",111,,
784,0.97,5024.285,5024.719,Temporary labor.,111,,
785,0.97,5024.719,5025.253,Other Nonlabor savings.,111,,
786,0.97,5025.253,5035.263,I wanted to ask about something that has been a priority for me that is actually in Councilmember Strauss's district.,111,,
787,0.97,5035.263,5035.764,"District 6, last year.",111,,
788,0.97,5035.764,5046.007,And I think the previous year I had advocated for park ambassadors.,111,,
789,0.97,5046.007,5051.413,"And also, the Portland Lou.",111,,
790,0.97,5051.413,5058.286,And Councilmember Bagshaw at the time was a real ally in my desire to see those services funded.,111,,
791,0.97,5058.286,5061.956,"I do believe if I recall, those were temporary positions.",111,,
792,0.97,5061.956,5071.232,Just wanted to get an understanding of that is going to be impacted.,111,,
793,0.97,5071.232,5072.567,Or if that is impacted.,111,,
794,0.97,5072.567,5075.47,.,112,,
795,0.97,5075.47,5080.308,I will have to get you a more specific answer to this.,113,,
796,0.97,5080.308,5082.844,These are the vacancies and the reduced temporary labor.,113,,
797,0.97,5082.844,5092.854,"I don't know if that line item was impacted by this, but I can get you that answer.",113,,
798,0.97,5092.854,5093.354,I appreciate it.,114,,
799,0.97,5093.354,5098.56,I think it continues to be a high priority for me.,114,,
800,0.97,5098.56,5109.237,"And, I would appreciate knowing a little more detail.",114,,
801,0.97,5109.237,5119.214,If there is an alternative approach there to meet the ongoing needs on Ballard's common park as it relates to hygiene needs.,114,,
802,0.97,5119.214,5122.851,"And, park Ambassador needs, et cetera, et cetera.",114,,
803,0.97,5122.851,5138.099,"And Lastly, I would just say, I totally understand the decisions you have to make around savings to offset park Fund.",114,,
804,0.97,5138.099,5144.372,We are having to make difficult decisions and it is impossible to see the forest through the trees.,114,,
805,0.97,5144.372,5165.593,And making sure that we are keeping our eye on the prize in terms of making sure that we can come back to these really important projects that we have begun as I'm sure is a shared priority there.,114,,
806,0.97,5165.593,5174.702,"Councilmember Sally Bagshaw screened somewhere in district seven, just without even knowing we have Smith Cove phase one delays.",114,,
807,0.97,5174.702,5181.576,That is a high priority for her and a legacy project for her.,114,,
808,0.97,5181.576,5186.681,"And, really sincerely I hope we can get back to finally getting that across the finish line.",114,,
809,0.97,5186.681,5190.318,But absolutely understand that these are difficult decisions.,114,,
810,0.97,5190.318,5196.391,"And, I understand what is Fueling the sort of filters that you are applying here.",114,,
811,0.97,5196.391,5197.358,That necessitate that delay.,114,,
812,0.97,5197.358,5197.725,Thank you.,115,,
813,0.97,5197.725,5209.17,"And actually, just to go back to your question, also, reminding myself we are still in the middle of a pandemic.",115,,
814,0.97,5209.17,5212.707,"So a lot of the work we can't do right now, for one.",115,,
815,0.97,5212.707,5218.813,"But, these are one time costs.",115,,
816,0.97,5218.813,5225.52,"Either way, that line is not impacted by the reductions.",115,,
817,0.97,5225.52,5239.234,I know some of the activation work was specifically tied to the impacts related to some of the unsheltered population that lives in and near the park.,116,,
818,0.97,5239.234,5247.475,So I wanted to make sure that we are reconciling what the true purpose is of those services.,116,,
819,0.97,5247.475,5252.914,Which are a little different than just activation for recreation purposes.,116,,
820,0.97,5252.914,5258.219,But happy to have ongoing conversations with you all about that.,116,,
821,0.97,5258.219,5258.553,Thank you.,117,,
822,0.97,5258.553,5259.354,Should I go on?,117,,
823,0.97,5259.354,5260.221,Yes.,118,,
824,0.97,5260.221,5262.223,I wanted to let you know.,118,,
825,0.97,5262.223,5263.124,I'm not kidding.,118,,
826,0.97,5263.124,5270.865,"I'm getting messages from people saying Yay, parks!",118,,
827,0.97,5270.865,5271.332,Exclamation point.,118,,
828,0.97,5271.332,5276.904,And it's not coming from Councilmember Juarez.,118,,
829,0.97,5276.904,5277.772,Yes it is.,119,,
830,0.97,5277.772,5280.408,We appreciate you being our grand finale here.,120,,
831,0.97,5280.408,5286.114,"Thanks, I appreciate that.",121,,
832,0.97,5286.114,5301.429,"So, then moving onto 2021, so, our 2021 budget still assumes there I an ongoing Covid-19 emergency and we will continue to provide response there with some of the activities.",121,,
833,0.97,5301.429,5310.271,Also assumes there will be ongoing reductions in social activities.,121,,
834,0.97,5310.271,5313.508,The Needsof our community are significant and will continue to increase.,121,,
835,0.97,5313.508,5320.381,The way we framed and created a 2021 budget recognizes these things.,121,,
836,0.97,5320.381,5326.621,Recognizes that our work supports communities and what we really focus on was trying to maintain that operational capacity.,121,,
837,0.97,5326.621,5330.825,That's where you will see much of our losses.,121,,
838,0.97,5330.825,5337.298,"Yeah, the revenue losses and reductions is pushing out some of our capital projects.",121,,
839,0.97,5337.298,5341.602,"Again, we are a people focused organization and we want to continue to serve our community.",121,,
840,0.97,5341.602,5346.007,Especially as we begin to be able to wrap up.,121,,
841,0.97,5346.007,5347.241,"So, I'll go into more detail.",121,,
842,0.97,5347.241,5360.655,But just to give you a broad overview of how significant the reductions for 2021 are for us.,121,,
843,0.97,5360.655,5370.431,They include an $11.4 million reduction in our general fund which we are offsetting but funding realignment to the park district.,121,,
844,0.97,5370.431,5381.142,To the tune of 8.9 million and $1.3 million reductions in spending and shifting some debt service payments.,121,,
845,0.97,5381.142,5390.518,"In addition to that 11.4 million general fund reduction, we have a $19.3 million reduction.",121,,
846,0.97,5390.518,5399.227,"Just like I mentioned, just went over for 2020, in 2021, we are anticipating a further park fund revenue gap of $10.5 million.",121,,
847,0.97,5399.227,5402.163,We expect it to be better.,121,,
848,0.97,5402.163,5427.522,"But the caveat here, we built the budget on the assumption that during 2021, we will, it allows us to bring gatherings together of 50 people or less, we would be able to open our buildings to the capacity of 58% or less.",121,,
849,0.97,5427.522,5427.955,That has changed.,121,,
850,0.97,5427.955,5430.224,The gatherings are 10 or less.,121,,
851,0.97,5430.224,5434.896,And the buildings 25% or less capacity.,121,,
852,0.97,5434.896,5442.17,"Unfortunately, that means that these projections will likely not come to bear and the picture might look worse.",121,,
853,0.97,5442.17,5451.813,"So, I want to make sure that I am completely up front about that.",121,,
854,0.97,5451.813,5454.248,Let me go onto the next slide.,121,,
855,0.97,5454.248,5456.584,Before we dig more deeply into the numbers.,121,,
856,0.97,5456.584,5465.026,We are a people centered organization and our focus is really about serving our neediest people.,121,,
857,0.97,5465.026,5476.237,"And, our organization really as Councilmember Juarez has stated in the beginning, we are focused on becoming an Anti- racist equity center organization through our work.",121,,
858,0.97,5476.237,5480.107,We have tried to do that in our response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.,121,,
859,0.97,5480.107,5485.78,But as well as our 2021 planning and our planning beyond.,121,,
860,0.97,5485.78,5521.215,"Not to state the obvious, but this crisis, probably like every crisis, disproportionately impacts our communities of color and we anticipate that with the work that we do, that whatever priorities were emerging prior to this crisis an all of these exciting conversations we are having as part of the strategic process, priorities will continue to change.",121,,
861,0.97,5521.215,5526.22,"So, that has required us to look at how we make the decisions and applying racial equity analysis.",121,,
862,0.97,5526.22,5530.424,Both the short term and long term funding decisions.,121,,
863,0.97,5530.424,5547.041,Obviously goes into picking which capital projects we put on hold in which which we try to continue and program as much as we can.,121,,
864,0.97,5547.041,5561.022,"And, really, as we go into the next cycle of the park district, this has proven to be flexible, a helpful source of funding for us.",121,,
865,0.97,5561.022,5568.763,"As we emerge from this emergency, we will have to have some difficult and deep conversations about how we continue to serve our most vulnerable communities.",121,,
866,0.97,5568.763,5575.603,"At parks and recreation, we are focused on becoming an Anti- racist equity center Department.",121,,
867,0.97,5575.603,5593.688,"Race is at the foundation, but we recognize that Intersectionalty plays a significant part in the levels of Marginalization particularly in the Bpoc communities.",121,,
868,0.97,5593.688,5607.969,We have used modified racial tool kits to dig into these decisions to guide all of our staff.,121,,
869,0.97,5607.969,5611.172,How to Embed racial equity.,121,,
870,0.97,5611.172,5611.872,And our work force decisions.,121,,
871,0.97,5611.872,5614.375,We are continue to work on that.,121,,
872,0.97,5614.375,5635.296,"In our budget, there will be impacts to our operations and some of the reductions required by Covid-19, because of some of the funding here, we will result in a reduction in activities and facilities available to the public.",121,,
873,0.97,5635.296,5640.701,"The community centers, we can't open them back up to the extent they were before.",121,,
874,0.97,5640.701,5657.051,"We have taken advantage of the fact there's five community centers that are undergoing, they still have funding for CIP projects that continue to be funded.",121,,
875,0.97,5657.051,5659.854,Those will remain closed for likely the entirety of the year.,121,,
876,0.97,5659.854,5674.168,"But, recognizing that in some of those communities, there's a great need for programming so we will provide additional alternative programming during those closures and have been piling some of that during the summer.",121,,
877,0.97,5674.168,5674.668,I mentioned our pools.,121,,
878,0.97,5674.668,5681.275,Pools generate a lot of revenue.,121,,
879,0.97,5681.275,5690.084,"Given the health restrictions of Covid-19 and the loss of revenue tied to those restrictions, we won't be able to open all ten of our pools.",121,,
880,0.97,5690.084,5693.921,We will be planning on opening just five of our pools.,121,,
881,0.97,5693.921,5704.965,"As we make that decision, we want to make sure the pools serve communities of color and so, we haven't made the final decisions.",121,,
882,0.97,5704.965,5712.807,"Probably meadow Brook in the North side, serving a lot of the community in Lake city.",121,,
883,0.97,5712.807,5717.812,"And then, in the central district.",121,,
884,0.97,5717.812,5722.817,We will focus on our scholarship money for scholarships for swim lessons.,121,,
885,0.97,5722.817,5725.653,Allowing families to register for that.,121,,
886,0.97,5725.653,5728.789,We know there is such a disparate impact.,121,,
887,0.97,5728.789,5737.898,"Particularly of Drownings, et cetera, for communities of color.",121,,
888,0.97,5737.898,5742.403,We don't want to exacerbate that.,121,,
889,0.97,5742.403,5745.072,We are Prioritizing these diminished resources.,121,,
890,0.97,5745.072,5753.914,We know the impact communities.,121,,
891,0.97,5753.914,5754.315,Across the city.,121,,
892,0.97,5754.315,5759.954,Working hand in hand with us across the city.,121,,
893,0.97,5759.954,5768.095,We have made those hard decisions by focusing on Bpoc communities.,121,,
894,0.97,5768.095,5773.467,"These sites at South Park, the site at the ADCC.",121,,
895,0.97,5773.467,5774.702,And the North Rainier site.,121,,
896,0.97,5774.702,5782.176,Those are tough decisions but we are working to do the best that we can.,121,,
897,0.97,5782.176,5791.285,"Director Aguirre, just before you move off this slide, I know the subsequent slides will get into the line item reductions and where shifts are occurring.",122,,
898,0.97,5791.285,5806.967,"But, specific will using our Anti-Racist lens, we are really proud and appreciative of the work that you and the front line workers have done specific to child care.",122,,
899,0.97,5806.967,5812.072,"Making showers, and shelter space available in your community centers.",122,,
900,0.97,5812.072,5826.52,Given that there's higher numbers of people of color working as essential workers.,122,,
901,0.97,5826.52,5827.221,Needing essential child care.,122,,
902,0.97,5827.221,5842.436,"Can you add a broad overview to give us a preview of whether or not in 2021, there is increased capacity in the budget for showers and shelters through your community centers?",122,,
903,0.97,5842.436,5846.407,And if there is increased capacity for child care relative to this year?,122,,
904,0.97,5846.407,5854.982,"In terms of the capacity question, so, the showers, we will continue to operate the site we have been operating.",123,,
905,0.97,5854.982,5864.692,We have five sites that operate across the city.,123,,
906,0.97,5864.692,5869.63,The green Lake site will have capacity.,123,,
907,0.97,5869.63,5872.366,We are replacing some of the boiler systems.,123,,
908,0.97,5872.366,5878.505,We worked with Spu as their clean program to set up a mobile shower there.,123,,
909,0.97,5878.505,5882.376,We will have it at least three days a week.,123,,
910,0.97,5882.376,5893.988,"In terms of the child care and ongoing support for essential workers, we are continuing to work on those in partnership with deal.",123,,
911,0.97,5893.988,5911.205,"Currently, we are operating both child care, school age child care as well as we have set up some teen hubs to support our teenagers who might be struggling with the virtual program the school district was offering.",123,,
912,0.97,5911.205,5913.507,Providing staff support as well.,123,,
913,0.97,5913.507,5915.209,"Access to Internet Connectivity, et cetera.",123,,
914,0.97,5915.209,5931.025,"In terms of whether that is increasing or decreasing, where we end up with our ability to have other programs.",123,,
915,0.97,5931.025,5933.093,Our child care should continue.,123,,
916,0.97,5933.093,5942.236,Sort of assessing whether we try to consolidate some of those groups so we continue to provide access to that for a longer period.,123,,
917,0.97,5942.236,5944.772,I'm not sure if I answered your question.,123,,
918,0.97,5944.772,5946.006,I forgot what I was saying.,123,,
919,0.97,5946.006,5947.241,[Laughter],123,,
920,0.97,5947.241,5959.119,"I think the take away was that at the very least, it's maintenance at the shower facilities.",124,,
921,0.97,5959.119,5962.356,Capital projects will move in a trailer for at least three days.,124,,
922,0.97,5962.356,5971.432,"On the child care, it sounded like because of decreased enrollment, there might be some consolidation.",124,,
923,0.97,5971.432,5983.243,On both fronts it didn't sound like a planned increase for 2021.,124,,
924,0.97,5983.243,5986.58,You also mentioned sheltering.,125,,
925,0.97,5986.58,5988.449,We support the sheltering strategy.,125,,
926,0.97,5988.449,5992.753,"In regular emergencies, winter weather, et cetera, we have done so during this pandemic.",125,,
927,0.97,5992.753,5994.655,We are poised to continue to do that.,125,,
928,0.97,5994.655,6008.135,"As we do our planning and we selected the sites for child care for example, we do our best to not have child care at the sites we anticipate might become shelters because they have historically.",125,,
929,0.97,6008.135,6014.007,We are trying to find the right balance for the limited space that we have.,125,,
930,0.97,6014.007,6020.014,That makes a lot of sense.,126,,
931,0.97,6020.014,6028.088,I am trying to be conscious in trying to limit those items on my priority list.,127,,
932,0.97,6028.088,6048.575,I have already talked about the interest in looking at the possibility of health one ban being added to the proposal and I would like to signal interest in providing additional child care capacity and there are a number interested this this.,127,,
933,0.97,6048.575,6062.389,"I am looking forward to working with you, with Councilmember Juarez and Strauss, I know you have taken some leadership roles on expanding child care.",127,,
934,0.97,6062.389,6064.725,This is a priority for our entire Council.,127,,
935,0.97,6064.725,6068.729,We will look forward to hearing more on the lessons learned in terms of capacity and space.,127,,
936,0.97,6068.729,6087.081,"If they are less full than you anticipated but we know that all of the National reports continue so say without access to child care, we will not be able to recover economically.",127,,
937,0.97,6087.081,6088.082,This is a big priority.,127,,
938,0.97,6088.082,6091.218,To see how we can look at various partner to do that with.,127,,
939,0.97,6091.218,6095.255,"If I may, just a little more on the child care.",128,,
940,0.97,6095.255,6100.994,Maybe take advantage and do a little bit of a commercial.,128,,
941,0.97,6100.994,6109.703,"We have space, we have scholarship money available for the communities, for the families who need that.",128,,
942,0.97,6109.703,6113.907,"We have seen though we are Underenrolled, the need is there.",128,,
943,0.97,6113.907,6120.581,"Serving the students Furthest from educational justice, we have a larger proportion of the families that are participating now that are receiving scholarship.",128,,
944,0.97,6120.581,6124.084,Than we normally do in a regular school age care program.,128,,
945,0.97,6124.084,6127.121,We know the need is there an folks are taking advantage of it.,128,,
946,0.97,6127.121,6129.256,"So, please, if you need it, come and register.",128,,
947,0.97,6129.256,6129.623,Thank you.,129,,
948,0.97,6129.623,6135.028,"An we will follow up with you, I would love to push that information out to our Council channels as well.",129,,
949,0.97,6135.028,6139.933,"If we could get that Info on that, that would be great.",129,,
950,0.97,6139.933,6140.2,Great.,130,,
951,0.97,6140.2,6140.767,Thank you.,130,,
952,0.97,6140.767,6146.273,May I continue?,131,,
953,0.97,6146.273,6146.94,"Oh, I'm sorry.",131,,
954,0.97,6146.94,6161.455,I just wanted to thank the superintendent and his team at parks for recognizing who is Livering at Magnuson park.,132,,
955,0.97,6161.455,6167.561,There was a recent census done on the affording housing project there.,132,,
956,0.97,6167.561,6169.663,And it is 61%.,132,,
957,0.97,6169.663,6186.046,"I want to appreciate his attention to the park, not only as a regional aspect, but also, the residents who are living there and need access to programming there at the park.",132,,
958,0.97,6186.046,6186.346,Thank you.,132,,
959,0.97,6186.346,6190.284,Thank you.,133,,
960,0.97,6190.284,6194.988,Should I continue?,133,,
961,0.97,6194.988,6196.79,Yes.,134,,
962,0.97,6196.79,6197.024,Please.,134,,
963,0.97,6197.024,6197.324,Thank you.,134,,
964,0.97,6197.324,6197.624,Thanks.,135,,
965,0.97,6197.624,6208.202,"So, then, digging into the actual numbers here, let me make sure I didn't skip.",135,,
966,0.97,6208.202,6212.906,"So, this slide is, I think Councilmember Pederson talked apples and oranges.",135,,
967,0.97,6212.906,6214.508,There's a lot high level.,135,,
968,0.97,6214.508,6218.912,There's a lot of lines that go into this.,135,,
969,0.97,6218.912,6224.284,"On this slide, maybe rather than try and go in and understand some of these apples to apples comparisons.",135,,
970,0.97,6224.284,6226.687,I want to highlight a couple of things here.,135,,
971,0.97,6226.687,6232.326,"One thing of NOTE here, you will see, this is almost the same.",135,,
972,0.97,6232.326,6240.2,We really were focused on keeping our work force intact though we are Holing many vacancies.,135,,
973,0.97,6240.2,6245.472,We have one position we are aggregating as part of this process.,135,,
974,0.97,6245.472,6252.679,The other thing I will highlight here is the reduction in rate.,135,,
975,0.97,6252.679,6255.749,I will get into more detail there.,135,,
976,0.97,6255.749,6259.586,"But, if I may, I would like to start going into some of the detail.",135,,
977,0.97,6259.586,6266.593,And this is a specific example of questions on this higher level.,135,,
978,0.97,6266.593,6266.86,Okay.,136,,
979,0.97,6266.86,6271.231,"Similarly here, I and the team can answer specific questions.",137,,
980,0.97,6271.231,6284.745,"As we mentioned our approach to the 2021 budget was about capturing savings through the efficiency's reductions, vacancies and mitigating ongoing one time revenue issues.",137,,
981,0.97,6284.745,6290.317,"So, these next few slides, as the other agencies go through, there's reductions, cost savings.",137,,
982,0.97,6290.317,6297.357,"And then, after these, I will go through some of the realignments similar to what we have done in 2020.",137,,
983,0.97,6297.357,6301.662,"So, again, I'm happy to answer specific questions.",137,,
984,0.97,6301.662,6307.768,"There is some efficiency, savings captured from efficiencies in a couple of our divisions.",137,,
985,0.97,6307.768,6311.705,"Most of these are looking at Nonlabor costs, et cetera.",137,,
986,0.97,6311.705,6314.508,"But I can continue, unless there are specific questions on these.",137,,
987,0.97,6314.508,6316.643,I don't see any hands.,138,,
988,0.97,6316.643,6317.077,Thank you so much.,138,,
989,0.97,6317.077,6326.92,And I think it is fair to say there is not an overall Ste elimination for parks so that's a fair assumption.,138,,
990,0.97,6326.92,6327.32,Correct.,139,,
991,0.97,6327.32,6330.724,The total is one ft we are eliminated.,139,,
992,0.97,6330.724,6338.198,We have a lot of vacancies that are helping us move these shortfalls but that's correct.,139,,
993,0.97,6338.198,6342.369,"This next slide again, I can go into any detail.",139,,
994,0.97,6342.369,6351.044,I will maybe call out line six here talks specifically about that one FTE.,139,,
995,0.97,6351.044,6354.181,Our volunteer coordinator supervisor who is managing the program unit.,139,,
996,0.97,6354.181,6358.018,That function is moving to someone else.,139,,
997,0.97,6358.018,6359.386,We are eliminating that position.,139,,
998,0.97,6359.386,6368.395,"I will note, line item five here, is more of an operational change that does capture some savings.",139,,
999,0.97,6368.395,6375.569,You may know Alki community center is a pretty small community center adjacent to Alki elementary school.,139,,
1000,0.97,6375.569,6394.121,"Technically, it is classified as a full service community center but primarily, it provides child care and early learning and what this change does is officially move it away from being a full service community center to a child care Hub.",139,,
1001,0.97,6394.121,6400.46,Shouldn't change much from the programming standpoint.,139,,
1002,0.97,6400.46,6414.808,"Hopefully, you will see though this is a small recapture of funds given the significant challenge of who we had, I wanted to highlight a couple of those.",139,,
1003,0.97,6414.808,6430.524,"Moving onto this slide, so, this slide, again, goes through both some reductions and cost saving measures in our park Fund.",140,,
1004,0.97,6430.524,6446.94,"There is significant reductions that have caused, we talked about some of the capital projects, some of our CIP programs have been either eliminated, most of these have other funding sources.",140,,
1005,0.97,6446.94,6455.248,"But, the reap funding has been eliminated or pushed out several years.",140,,
1006,0.97,6455.248,6459.052,Things like our comfort situation.,140,,
1007,0.97,6459.052,6459.686,"Ball lighting, replacement.",140,,
1008,0.97,6459.686,6464.224,These programs we continue to do to better the maintenance on.,140,,
1009,0.97,6464.224,6466.059,Some of those have been limit.,140,,
1010,0.97,6466.059,6467.828,Others have been pushed out.,140,,
1011,0.97,6467.828,6479.239,"Again, just to try to make the numbers match.",140,,
1012,0.97,6479.239,6480.674,And balance the budget.,140,,
1013,0.97,6480.674,6488.148,"So, this slide, again, it is important to note here that even know for 2021, it doesn't show the specific reductions.",140,,
1014,0.97,6488.148,6496.656,"But again, our reap funding has been reduced for the entire CIP, the six year CIP.",140,,
1015,0.97,6496.656,6500.894,I wanted to all out that we will impact communities.,140,,
1016,0.97,6500.894,6509.936,"And, the Queen Anne West Queen Anne play field conversion project has been pushed out from 2024.",140,,
1017,0.97,6509.936,6517.911,It will go out beyond the six year CIP program.,140,,
1018,0.97,6517.911,6524.317,And the other backlog projects significantly have been Reduc Ed.,140,,
1019,0.97,6524.317,6529.589,I'll keep going unless you throw something at me.,140,,
1020,0.97,6529.589,6530.19,That's great.,141,,
1021,0.97,6530.19,6531.091,Director noble.,141,,
1022,0.97,6531.091,6531.825,Did you have something?,141,,
1023,0.97,6531.825,6542.168,"I wanted to comment, the impacts is down for this year, 2020 and 2021.",142,,
1024,0.97,6542.168,6544.304,And the CIP is a six year planning document.,142,,
1025,0.97,6544.304,6546.907,We are looking at the long run impacts there.,142,,
1026,0.97,6546.907,6555.048,"In addition, I think I highlighted this.",142,,
1027,0.97,6555.048,6563.056,We are directing a significant chair of read into the bonds issue.,142,,
1028,0.97,6563.056,6564.124,On the West Seattle ridge.,142,,
1029,0.97,6564.124,6566.626,There is the revenue pressure and the expenditure pressure.,142,,
1030,0.97,6566.626,6578.338,And you see this as an impact over the full six years CIP.,142,,
1031,0.97,6578.338,6581.541,Someone is a little under the weather today.,142,,
1032,0.97,6581.541,6584.177,Welcome to the meeting.,143,,
1033,0.97,6584.177,6585.412,Thank you director.,143,,
1034,0.97,6585.412,6591.084,Thank you.,144,,
1035,0.97,6591.084,6593.853,"Again, Ly continue unless folks have questions.",144,,
1036,0.97,6593.853,6603.063,This focuses on our reduction in the general fund.,144,,
1037,0.97,6603.063,6603.93,With some expenditure savings.,144,,
1038,0.97,6603.93,6604.164,Labor.,144,,
1039,0.97,6604.164,6619.779,"I mentioned early on, that there is also a debt service swap with the general fund now being Mov Ed over and continuing with some of these realignments.",144,,
1040,0.97,6619.779,6628.288,"Some of the landing sites for example, this is opportunistic that we put several on hold as part of our 2020 budget.",144,,
1041,0.97,6628.288,6637.731,We don't need to maintain and operate them to the same level so we recaptured $1.2 million in savings from the park district.,144,,
1042,0.97,6637.731,6641.134,We have reduced our Parkland acquisition program.,144,,
1043,0.97,6641.134,6654.848,"And, it will now focus on acquiring more green spaces and green belt in areas which tend to be lower in cost.",144,,
1044,0.97,6654.848,6672.866,"But strategically, we are keeping a staff person to make sure the relationships that go into any and acquisition that take many years, we build relationships with the homeowners and landowners interested.",144,,
1045,0.97,6672.866,6682.642,We also have reduced the major projects challenge fund which is a grant program.,144,,
1046,0.97,6682.642,6698.758,That was already going to be Reenvisioned in equity.,144,,
1047,0.97,6698.758,6708.802,"And then, we are con continuing major maintenance backlog funded by the park district.",144,,
1048,0.97,6708.802,6735.028,"And, again, you know, all of these reductions will cause us to once all of these things are Aproved to go back and look at our asset management we will look at how we manage from the cradle to the grave to make sure we maintain these assets in a way so we don't lose them given the reduction in some of these programs, also looking at life safety.",144,,
1049,0.97,6735.028,6738.031,Looking at some of these buildings are literally falling apart.,144,,
1050,0.97,6738.031,6748.808,We have to preserve the assets looking at environmental efficiencies.,144,,
1051,0.97,6748.808,6761.654,Over overall management program will be Redone once we get through all of these changes.,144,,
1052,0.97,6761.654,6773.833,"So in terms of the park Fund, in 2020, we are expecting a $19.2 million park fund for 2021.",144,,
1053,0.97,6773.833,6781.407,"We were hoping for a $10.5 million reduction, but this was built on a phase three scheme that has now changed.",144,,
1054,0.97,6781.407,6786.112,"We will have to keep monitoring that very, very closely.",144,,
1055,0.97,6786.112,6799.559,"The way that we are meeting this is again through a savings program, vacancies, temporary labor in programs funded by the park Fund.",144,,
1056,0.97,6799.559,6806.232,"And then, furthering some of the one-time savings from park district realignment.",144,,
1057,0.97,6806.232,6808.468,"Again, savoring our forest line item.",144,,
1058,0.97,6808.468,6814.174,"The arts in the parks, the better programs for youth et cetera.",144,,
1059,0.97,6814.174,6827.22,"These programs, I will say that most of these are holding vacancies, better programs for youth are holding vacancies and stopping one of our quality assessment programs but we are continuing to do program.",144,,
1060,0.97,6827.22,6835.295,"All of these line items will try to further the Intents of those programs but of course, we are reducing them.",144,,
1061,0.97,6835.295,6843.169,"And the last one here, I will note, is the waterfront.",144,,
1062,0.97,6843.169,6843.67,The central waterfront.,144,,
1063,0.97,6843.67,6849.142,It is basically moving out of the park district.,144,,
1064,0.97,6849.142,6855.915,"And, funding it with other sources.",144,,
1065,0.97,6855.915,6857.584,Thank you very much.,145,,
1066,0.97,6857.584,6863.323,I don't see any questions on this.,145,,
1067,0.97,6863.323,6863.59,Okay.,146,,
1068,0.97,6863.59,6867.594,"Well, that's really the gist of our budget.",146,,
1069,0.97,6867.594,6870.463,"Again, very, very significant reductions in all of our funds.",146,,
1070,0.97,6870.463,6872.532,"And of course, utilizing the Úpark district.",146,,
1071,0.97,6872.532,6887.313,"And I will say, I think we are incredibly fortunate that the voters and elected officials have created this park district.",146,,
1072,0.97,6887.313,6900.693,My peers across the country don't have situations like this where they will not be able to emerge in the same way I think we will be able to emerge.,146,,
1073,0.97,6900.693,6908.835,"In terms of the next step for us, as Councilmember Juarez mentioned.",146,,
1074,0.97,6908.835,6912.672,I will pause because I think she had questions or comments here.,146,,
1075,0.97,6912.672,6931.224,"October 19, you will be presented with the city Orinance, the agreement between the city and park district that would allow us to delay the planning of the next six year cycle for a year based on the emergency situation.",146,,
1076,0.97,6931.224,6937.063,And there is the twin ordinance that authorizes this with park district resolution.,146,,
1077,0.97,6937.063,6947.74,And we will present to you an overview of the very specific park district 2021 budget.,146,,
1078,0.97,6947.74,6960.553,"On November 23, we will present to you a resolution that AMENDS our 2020 park district budget to revise all the allocations.",146,,
1079,0.97,6960.553,6966.993,Another ordinance that will suspend the general fund for 2021 that will reflect some of the changes we are proposing here.,146,,
1080,0.97,6966.993,6981.074,"And then, a resolution to adopt our 2021 part district budget as well as setting the property tax levy level for 2021.",146,,
1081,0.97,6981.074,6982.075,Thank you.,147,,
1082,0.97,6982.075,6982.542,Councilmember Juarez?,147,,

1084,0.97,6992.352,7009.002,"Thank you superintendent that we will hold a public hearing on the proposed 2021 budget and taking it to amendment that would appropriately delay the 202021, 2026 planning cycle.",148,,
1085,0.97,7009.002,7018.511,I want to thank you for your guidance and keeping these things streamlined and organized because it gets real tricky.,148,,
1086,0.97,7018.511,7029.389,"I will reiterate, after we vote on our 2021 budget, on November 23rd, the metropolitan park will vote.",148,,
1087,0.97,7029.389,7041.067,"We will then vote, we have vote as the board, the Council on the 2020 revised budget, and the adoption of the 2020 budget at the same time.",148,,
1088,0.97,7041.067,7045.138,"So, this is standard after we vote on the regular budget.",148,,
1089,0.97,7045.138,7055.148,And it will happen on the same day that the Council adopt s the city's budget.,148,,
1090,0.97,7055.148,7066.192,I just wanted to add that I asked the superintendent if he got together with director Zimbabwe at Sdot and if they got together to do their home work.,148,,
1091,0.97,7066.192,7070.096,Because their power points look a lot alike.,148,,
1092,0.97,7070.096,7071.297,"Unfortunately, we didn't.",149,,
1093,0.97,7071.297,7075.101,"I watched his presentation saying Oh, we should have done that, maybe we will next time.",149,,

1109,0.97,7145.171,7147.039,"So, no.",155,,
