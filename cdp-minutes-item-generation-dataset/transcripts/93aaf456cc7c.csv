185,0.97,1267.165,1280.846,I want to jump in briefly and ask on the progress of the senators exemption bill for the homeless shelter construction.,19,,
186,0.97,1280.846,1282.781,That has been kicking around the legislation for the last three years.,19,,
187,0.97,1282.781,1286.652,I heard that there will potentially be some movement on that bill.,19,,
188,0.97,1286.652,1295.06,And there was some critical senators that had come around and were supporting it now.,19,,
189,0.97,1295.06,1316.448,"I really want to flag that if something can come out of this session that can help the city to confront the homelessness crisis by passing that bill, the process considerably slowed down building the tiny House villages that ultimately were able to shelter the people living at the park.",19,,

204,0.97,1407.873,1415.48,I am wondering if House bill 1015 is on your radar?,22,,
205,0.97,1415.48,1416.448,It is something I am becoming versed in.,22,,
206,0.97,1416.448,1431.363,"And it passed the House last week, 97-0 and it is before the Senate . It is called the gum Washington equitable access to credit Act and it was moving last year and it is",22,,
207,0.97,1431.363,1433.265,Now.,23,,
208,0.97,1433.265,1443.742,Essentially what it does is it creates a program to fund grants through the Department of Commerce to certain community development financial institutions.,23,,

225,0.97,1565.664,1566.598,It will not look the same in two weeks.,26,,
226,0.97,1566.598,1569.267,"Is that fair to say, Elsa?",26,,
