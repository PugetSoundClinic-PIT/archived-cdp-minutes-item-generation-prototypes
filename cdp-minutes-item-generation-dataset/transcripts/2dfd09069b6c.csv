174,0.97,1337.135,1343.375,This past week I attended police role call for the second watch which is the nine hour shift from 11:00 A.M.,38,,
175,0.97,1343.375,1343.942,To 8:00 P.M.,38,,
176,0.97,1343.942,1346.878,Officers continued to be generous with their Frank feedback.,38,,
177,0.97,1346.878,1356.822,I believe it is in the city's best interest to let our officers know every way we can we appreciate the difficult work they do in our communities across the city Funning on officer wellness.,38,,
178,0.97,1356.822,1364.429,It is one way to address their extremely low morale and show we care about our fellow city employees serving Seattle.,38,,
179,0.97,1364.429,1377.142,I believe we can't afford to lose more highly trained officers and detectives beyond record break--the Department has already experienced.,38,,
180,0.97,1377.142,1387.352,"The--the need for our police officers and detectives was emphasized just this morning, early in morning.",38,,
181,0.97,1387.352,1388.72,Police responded to shots fired.,38,,
182,0.97,1388.72,1393.792,A dead body was found near the entrance of the park with gunshot wounds.,38,,
183,0.97,1393.792,1397.462,I've been in contact with the police Department this morning.,38,,
184,0.97,1397.462,1403.902,Homicide detectives have taken over the case and will work with the medical examiner to confirm the cause of death.,38,,
185,0.97,1403.902,1407.639,"I want to thank chief Adrian Diaz, police officers for responding.",38,,
186,0.97,1407.639,1415.847,The detectives now investigating and the Department for the overall response in this with this tragic incident.,38,,
187,0.97,1415.847,1417.816,Thank you.,38,,
188,0.97,1417.816,1418.984,That concludes my report.,38,,
189,0.97,1418.984,1419.985,Thank you.,39,,
190,0.97,1419.985,1423.555,Any comments or questions on that report?,39,,
191,0.97,1423.555,1423.822,All right.,39,,
192,0.97,1423.822,1426.324,"Hearing none, council member Strauss please.",39,,
193,0.97,1426.324,1426.758,Thank you.,40,,
194,0.97,1426.758,1427.859,Good morning Council President.,40,,
195,0.97,1427.859,1428.393,Good morning colleagues.,40,,
196,0.97,1428.393,1435.834,There is one item from the Committee on today's full council agenda.,40,,
197,0.97,1435.834,1444.142,It provides temporary flex Foblt downtown store fronts to address vacancies.,40,,
198,0.97,1444.142,1470.235,This is out of line with my personal standards for my own amendments coming forward before committee and moving forward I will ensure all of my own amendments are published on the agenda for my own committee accepting extenuating circumstances.,40,,
199,0.97,1470.235,1482.113,"I can't control each of you for walking on your amendments, this was out of line with my personal standards.",40,,
200,0.97,1482.113,1482.38,Apologies.,40,,
201,0.97,1482.38,1495.427,Also to this point I had commitments that some of the issues surrounding these amendments would have been worked out between committee and today which is why I allowed the bill to be passed out of committee.,40,,
202,0.97,1495.427,1498.897,These issues have not been resolved at that time.,40,,
203,0.97,1498.897,1522.854,"There has not been consensus and so--Council President between now and full council if we can't bring resolution to these issues, I will ask that we hold this bill until September 13th because moving doctor again, it is out of line with my personal standards to bring half baked ordinances from committee to Council.",40,,
204,0.97,1522.854,1535.867,I don't want to occupy full council with work that should be done in the committee.,40,,
205,0.97,1535.867,1540.171,These were not resolved in committee.,40,,
206,0.97,1540.171,1544.542,I will let Council member Lewis speak to these.,40,,
207,0.97,1544.542,1547.546,Then colleagues also just flagging at 9:09 A.M.,40,,
208,0.97,1547.546,1560.425,There was a letter from Department day day--directors regarding their concerns.,40,,
209,0.97,1560.425,1573.638,Departments have only just now weighed in which is why unless we can resolve these issues before full council I will ask to hold the bill.,40,,
210,0.97,1573.638,1590.221,So I mean as your comments just indicated it has been kind of a process on working through these amendments due to when we do receive feedback on the proposals.,41,,
211,0.97,1590.221,1596.461,"Some concerns that are old, some concerns that are new.",41,,
212,0.97,1596.461,1601.666,I'm happy to talk about these amendments for Council bill 120121.,41,,
213,0.97,1601.666,1613.278,I think I would preface at the beginning of this presentation on the amendments or discussion of the amendments that I do not think Mr. chair it is necessary to hold the bill.,41,,
214,0.97,1613.278,1631.83,I think some of these issues are just--going to don't come doing to philosophical disagreements between some Council members and the Department and would expect a vote on those amendments and taking it where it lies.,41,,
215,0.97,1631.83,1652.05,I don't think more time is going to address the concerns with one exception which I will speak to which was mentioned in the E-Mails from Department heads where I do think there is at least a resolution that will sat satisfy the community stake holders.,41,,
216,0.97,1652.05,1658.556,I will say I would be happy with having a vote on the amendments regardless of the outcome.,41,,
217,0.97,1658.556,1671.503,Given the importance of the underlying bill I would sub support voting on the amendments and the bill this afternoon and then calling it good and moving on given the importance of the legislation.,41,,
218,0.97,1671.503,1683.948,"Council member Lewis, before you jump in I want to say this work needed to be done in committee and that is--there are still further conversations I would like to have with you.",42,,
219,0.97,1683.948,1687.452,Jump in and then we can have that discussion.,42,,
220,0.97,1687.452,1691.79,If I could just Intercede really quickly.,43,,
221,0.97,1691.79,1717.816,It--by design it would--be my preference if there are outstanding policy issues that those issues be Hashed out in working sessions during committee meetings and it seems to me there are enough amendments here that perhaps that is an indication of there still needs to be some additional work on this bill before it is Hashed now full council.,43,,
222,0.97,1717.816,1724.689,That being said I haven't had an opportunity to connect with chair Strauss or Council member Lewis.,43,,
223,0.97,1724.689,1741.406,I would welcome the opportunity to do that over the next few hours to sort of assess whether there are truly some additional policy work sessions that need to occur or if this is fundamentally a disagreement on direction.,43,,
224,0.97,1741.406,1747.679,So if that is the case we can call into question and put this to rest.,43,,
225,0.97,1747.679,1762.026,"I think if there is opportunity for some additional policy work, then that seems to make sense to me for us to give us an opportunity to work those things out in committee.",43,,
226,0.97,1762.026,1767.499,Other committee members are welcomed to Chime in on that if you see fit.,43,,
227,0.97,1767.499,1796.327,For now lets have Council member Lewis talk through your amendments in the event that we do end up in a place where we vote on the bill and related amendments so that the full Council has the benefit of understanding your motivation and will leave the procedural aspects related to whether or not we should pursue the bill and the amendments in today's council meeting or a full council meeting on September 13th to be decided after the fact.,43,,
228,0.97,1796.327,1803.134,"If that is acceptable to you chair Strauss and Council member Lewis, that is how I propose we move forward.",43,,
229,0.97,1803.134,1808.773,"Okay, I got a thumbs up from chair Strauss and head nods from Council member Lewis.",43,,
230,0.97,1808.773,1816.147,Council member Lewis take it away.,43,,
231,0.97,1816.147,1821.719,"Thank you, Council President.",44,,
232,0.97,1821.719,1828.426,So I think that process definitely makes sense.,44,,
233,0.97,1828.426,1845.343,I also will take a moment to--discuss my position on whether further deliberation on these amendments would warrant a more productive process if it were sent back to Committee.,44,,
234,0.97,1845.343,1865.697,"So based on the conversation we had, it was evident that with one of the amendments that my office was proposing that would expand the level of allowable downtown street level uses to include street level office space as well as light manufacturing.",44,,
235,0.97,1865.697,1876.875,That there is a consensus on the light manufacturing use and indeed Department--the relevant departments did endorse that use in the E-mail they sent to us earlier today.,44,,
236,0.97,1876.875,1880.645,There continues to be disagreement over the office use.,44,,
237,0.97,1880.645,1890.955,I divided that amendment in two so we could have a pretty brief Non-Controversial vote on the light manufacturing where there is a consensus.,44,,
238,0.97,1890.955,1903.835,Could that have a separate vote on the office space so those issues could be divided out and allow for a discussion where there is still discussion to be warranted.,44,,
239,0.97,1903.835,1907.472,Those are two separate amendments now.,44,,
240,0.97,1907.472,1918.816,The office space issue continues to be one where there is division with policy makers at the city.,44,,
241,0.97,1918.816,1926.824,I would NOTE I don't think there is significant opposition from any downtown stake holders.,44,,
242,0.97,1926.824,1936.401,It would allow up to 30-Feet of frontage of office space in the downtown business district as a street level use.,44,,
243,0.97,1936.401,1942.073,This is something that has been requested by a number of stake holders in the district.,44,,
244,0.97,1942.073,1951.516,"It is something the departments, the relevant city departments have made clear that they do not support and I totally respect their decision to do that.",44,,
245,0.97,1951.516,1953.384,"I represent constituents, not city departments.",44,,
246,0.97,1953.384,1959.657,That is why I'm bringing this amendment to be discussed.,44,,
247,0.97,1959.657,1966.097,The general concern is I can gather is that office space is not a dynamic street level use.,44,,
248,0.97,1966.097,1971.703,I fully and totally concede that.,44,,
249,0.97,1971.703,1972.403,I have no disagreement.,44,,
250,0.97,1972.403,1987.952,Where I think this is a good public policy is that there are some places downtown that might not be activated in anyway except with a use like street level office use.,44,,
251,0.97,1987.952,1996.194,Street level office use is still more desirable than vacant store fronts or vacant buildings.,44,,
252,0.97,1996.194,2031.562,Giving this option to stake holders and property owners in the downtown core to activate spaces with inactive use that is providing some kind of activity is one that I would support in cases where no other use can be attracted which--like all of us would like to see Street fronts become cafes.,44,,
253,0.97,2031.562,2032.13,That is not always possible.,44,,
254,0.97,2032.13,2037.635,So that is why I brought that amendment.,44,,
255,0.97,2037.635,2049.447,I would say Council member Strauss I don't think any amount of additional policy discussion is going to get consensus between the city departments and the stake holders in my office on this issue.,44,,
256,0.97,2049.447,2062.126,"I would prefer to have a vote, respect the Council's decision on what policy choice we make but I don't think more process is going to create some kind of meeting of the minds.",44,,
257,0.97,2062.126,2067.265,It is like we earth support office space as a street level use or don't.,44,,
258,0.97,2067.265,2085.516,And I wanted to put that out there as kind of my view having discussed this fairly extensively with the relevant departments for several weeks and will respect the decision made.,44,,
259,0.97,2085.516,2093.591,The final amendments would allow an office space among other uses for street level uses in the Pioneer square historic district.,44,,
260,0.97,2093.591,2102.733,"It would allow approval by the Department of neighborhoods, director.",44,,
261,0.97,2102.733,2118.816,The issue that was Cryptically eluded to--the only named stake holder in the E-mail that had think issue with any of the amendments--I was able to call at least Howard to ask her about the issues.,44,,
262,0.97,2118.816,2131.329,"She said as long as the amendment makes it clear that the office space frontage rule is the same for downtown and Pioneer square, she does not have any problem with that component of the amendment.",44,,
263,0.97,2131.329,2143.841,My office has talked to Lish who is going to be distributing a change to that amendment to reflect it which is a fairly small technical change.,44,,
264,0.97,2143.841,2144.375,That satisfies that issue.,44,,
265,0.97,2144.375,2157.655,There is also some issues with how the Department of neighborhoods might administer the program that goes to the enforcement of the measure rather than a legislative component of it.,44,,
266,0.97,2157.655,2171.168,So again I don't think anymore process is going to change those issues aside from the technical change to the frontage which is an easy cosmetic change to make to the legislation.,44,,
267,0.97,2171.168,2172.303,So those are the amendments.,44,,
268,0.97,2172.303,2186.083,I certainly respect the decision of the chair if the chair wants to pull the bill for additional deliberation and consultation on this.,44,,
269,0.97,2186.083,2205.703,It is my opinion that more process isn't really going to change anything here but I certainly respect since this is chair Strauss' policy area if he wants to I'm happy to have another Committee hearing on this.,44,,
270,0.97,2205.703,2208.806,Also happy to just resolve these this afternoon.,44,,
271,0.97,2208.806,2212.41,With that I don't have anything else to add.,44,,
272,0.97,2212.41,2213.511,Thank you for that.,45,,
273,0.97,2213.511,2226.324,It is sort of an a tradition of the Council to respect the chair's request for hold if the chair so deems that request is appropriate.,45,,
274,0.97,2226.324,2230.995,I want to be conscious of that long time tradition on the Council.,45,,
275,0.97,2230.995,2240.938,Again I think there will be an opportunity for us to all connect Offline here to see if that is truly the chair's desire.,45,,
276,0.97,2240.938,2246.544,"If it is, again con basis twenty past practice would certainly want to honor the chair's request.",45,,
277,0.97,2246.544,2255.519,I will hand it back over to Council member Strauss since this is being had in--amidst your report.,45,,
278,0.97,2255.519,2257.021,"Thank you, Council President.",46,,
279,0.97,2257.021,2266.197,I think you highlighted the policy difference I was trying to iron the wrinkle of.,46,,
280,0.97,2266.197,2274.205,Amendment 3 has office space that needs to be consistent with amendment 2.,46,,
281,0.97,2274.205,2286.417,In a similar way you resolve--[Indiscernible] that is the crux of the afternoon.,46,,
282,0.97,2286.417,2291.155,If we can resolve that before full council I would be happy to bring it forward.,46,,
283,0.97,2291.155,2299.497,"If there are conversations about thousand move that amendment forward, N a way that creates sound policy, we will need to hold the bill.",46,,
284,0.97,2299.497,2304.335,That is where I will sit from there.,46,,
285,0.97,2304.335,2311.909,Council members again my apologies for having this committee work being done during Council briefing and at full council.,46,,
286,0.97,2311.909,2321.018,"Moving forward unless there are serious extenuating circumstances, I will only bring fully big ordinances for my committee to full council.",46,,
287,0.97,2321.018,2328.326,Again apologies to committee members and Council member Juarez for not having the amendments published on the agenda last week.,46,,
288,0.97,2328.326,2331.462,We did not receive these amendments in time to publish.,46,,
289,0.97,2331.462,2335.866,That is still no excuse for my amendment not being published.,46,,
290,0.97,2335.866,2344.642,Further it Epps from the land use neighborhoods committee there is one item on the introduction referral calendar.,46,,
291,0.97,2344.642,2353.284,Council bill 120157 which amended legislation that the Council adopted earlier this year related to affordable housing on religious institution properties.,46,,
292,0.97,2353.284,2359.89,Since adopting that legislation Council has heard from many stake holders.,46,,
293,0.97,2359.89,2372.203,The amendment adopted by Council lowering the AMI requirements from 80 to 60% made the legislation unworkable for them and many in our community.,46,,
294,0.97,2372.203,2399.53,The land use neighborhoods Committee is already considered these issues and voted differently than the full council my intention is to bring this legislation directly to full Council for a public hearing and vote in September because we have already had the committee work.,46,,
295,0.97,2399.53,2404.502,We have already had the full council work.,46,,
296,0.97,2404.502,2405.469,We will be rescheduling also.,46,,
297,0.97,2405.469,2411.208,In other news and land use neighborhoods committee we will be rescheduling our committee.,46,,
298,0.97,2411.208,2421.519,I will be requesting a special committee meeting during September as we do have a full docket of work to complete.,46,,
299,0.97,2421.519,2427.658,We will be rescheduling our September 8th meeting.,46,,
300,0.97,2427.658,2437.268,In other news the supplemental Whileal--I'm proposing two amendments.,46,,
301,0.97,2437.268,2444.575,Amendment 9b would provide funding to the Garfield super block project using excess revenue that Unallocated.,46,,
302,0.97,2444.575,2460.424,This is not in competition with Council member Sawant's amendment or this amendment recognizes that revenue is typically how city funds capital projects.,46,,
303,0.97,2460.424,2474.205,My Entension bringing this amendment is to give committee multiple options to fund the Garfield super block because it is such a great program and project given the large conversation that is also occurring to SPD over spend.,46,,
304,0.97,2474.205,2482.58,I just want to have another Avenue of making sure that Garfield super block is able to be successful this year.,46,,
305,0.97,2482.58,2499.697,"My amendment would provide $50,000 to Sdot to conduct the 10% of the street improvements needed to Ballard Avenue Northwest which is our pilot for how we can further engage, encourage permanent Street cafes across Seattle.",46,,
306,0.97,2499.697,2507.371,"While this is Ballard specific, it is the prototype that will be rolled out and informed city wide policies which is why I bring this.",46,,
307,0.97,2507.371,2516.18,This amendment has changed since the Summery was distributed to Council men--members last week.,46,,
308,0.97,2516.18,2526.223,We held the design just two weeks ago and there is fast moving work that needs be completed.,46,,
309,0.97,2526.357,2548.412,[Indiscernible] I believe we will be able to secure more funding for this project during the fall budget process.,46,,
310,0.97,2548.412,2559.857,Near our office as I just mention Wednesday are able to host Ballard Avenue design.,46,,
311,0.97,2559.857,2591.822,After the design on Tuesday--and so after the design we were able to summarize a lot of the good work we are excited to make sure that we are able to keep these really--this really amazing cafe culture here in our city.,46,,
312,0.97,2591.822,2600.731,Before the pandemic cafe culture was not part of Seattle and I'm excited it is now.,46,,
313,0.97,2600.731,2607.838,I also was able to join district 6 residents.,46,,
314,0.97,2607.838,2620.818,I'm also meeting with Association Washington City members to ensure we have a good working relationship and good policies ahead of next legislative session which starts in January.,46,,
315,0.97,2620.818,2626.724,My staff also met with the neighborhood Association last week and here in district 6 there is good news.,46,,

319,0.97,2656.253,2661.158,I'm excited to see--anticipating a beautiful kiss play of how salmon migrate through our water ways.,46,,
320,0.97,2661.158,2669.833,There is so much to be done change how salmon get from towns like Lake Washington to better encourage their health.,46,,

348,0.97,2824.054,2827.858,-- items.,48,,
349,0.97,2827.858,2846.276,Just a quick review on the legislation limiting the use of less lethal weapons.,48,,
350,0.97,2846.276,2853.951,"Background, there are currently no restrictions in the Seattle municipal code on the use of less lethal weapons.",48,,
351,0.97,2853.951,2880.577,You maw recall last summer the Council did pass legislation but the courts have basically issued an order on that piece of legislation and it is not in place because of the restraining order on the Council's bill.,48,,
352,0.97,2880.577,2889.72,So the committee has been working a alternative piece of legislation through committee since the beginning of this year.,48,,
353,0.97,2889.72,2898.829,Most recently the public safety and human services committee voted 4-1 to pass out the version of the bill that will have before us.,48,,
354,0.97,2898.829,2902.699,We voted in Committee on July 13th.,48,,
355,0.97,2902.699,2913.41,At that time I move to hold the bill so we would not have it in full council till after the consent decree status conference.,48,,
356,0.97,2913.41,2914.311,That occurred last week.,48,,
357,0.97,2914.311,2945.742,"Many case the court wanted to weigh in on the legislation, we know that--[Indiscernible] we were interested to know whether or not there--the conference was going to give any insight on that review.",48,,
358,0.97,2945.742,2948.945,No comment on the legislation at its conference.,48,,
359,0.97,2948.945,2958.088,So we are moving forward with the full council vote today.,48,,
360,0.97,2958.088,2971.702,"The legislation includes a full ban on acoustic weapons, energy directed weapons, blast balls, ultra sonic Cannons and water Cannons.",48,,
361,0.97,2971.702,2986.416,Use of noise flash devices otherwise known as flash bangs are banned in demonstrations but under the legislation there are circumstances where flash bangs can be used.,48,,
362,0.97,2986.416,2990.754,They are not permitted in demonstrations.,48,,
363,0.97,2990.754,2994.992,So for instance certain types of activities.,48,,
364,0.97,2994.992,3017.614,The bill conditions the use of pepper spray and pepper ball launchers on those instances when the risk of serious bodily injury for violent actions out weighs the risk of harm to bystanders and finally it is permitted in very narrow circumstances.,48,,
365,0.97,3017.614,3026.923,The bill does not regulate in anyway the use of Non-Chemical launchers.,48,,
366,0.97,3026.923,3039.803,"For instance bean bags, rubber bullets, blue--projectiles and so the--again legislation is silent on the use of those less lethal weapons.",48,,
367,0.97,3039.803,3052.282,"Out of my respect for the process, we have met with the monitor and the Department of justice.",48,,
368,0.97,3052.282,3079.776,Council member Gonzalez has also--[Indiscernible] the committee first acted February to recommend a draft bill and that bill is what was used for those discussions with the monitor and the Department of justice.,48,,
369,0.97,3079.776,3119.616,In conversations about the draft bill Department of justice expressed concerns about the potential that restrict Stricting the use of certain less lethal--[Indiscernible] DOJ was inquired as the whether or not the draft bill would provide time for relevant SPD officers to be trained in the policy.,48,,
370,0.97,3119.616,3132.162,"So, it is also--[Indiscernible] so the amendment--or the legislation was amended or not amended cause it hadn't been introduced yet.",48,,
371,0.97,3132.162,3141.004,"The--legislation added a new definition of crowd control, provided training after the court approved legislation.",48,,
372,0.97,3141.004,3162.125,It made a number of other types of changes such as allowing for the use of--of pepper ball launches in a demonstration of rally but not for crowd control purposes and only when the risk of bodily serious injury from violent actions out weighs the risk of harm to bystanders.,48,,
373,0.97,3162.125,3168.832,Again this changes in response to the feedback we have received and initial decision.,48,,
374,0.97,3168.832,3203.9,"You may recall a District Court ruling allowed use of pepper ball launchers in restricted circumstances--[Indiscernible] so, um, again in August the Cpctoig and the OPA recommendations August of last year--were sent to Council and the judge--because he requested them as well.",48,,
375,0.97,3203.9,3211.041,These were recommendation in light of our June 2020 legislation.,48,,
376,0.97,3211.041,3226.089,Has been sort of the foundation for this bill is based on we first--produced legislation on the things that they agreed on.,48,,
377,0.97,3226.089,3236.266,Then again as I have described there have been changes throughout the course of the year worth of deliberations.,48,,
378,0.97,3236.266,3244.507,Cpc has written as in response to this most current version of the bill to offer their support of the bill.,48,,
379,0.97,3244.507,3264.16,They wrote saying they believe the bill's inclusion of--[Indiscernible] and the limitations on who can use them is a significant first step in ensuring the safety of community members when they get engaged in first amended protected protests.,48,,
380,0.97,3264.16,3285.949,They NOTE they appreciate the improvements but they also want to make sure that we understand that there is more work to be done and that the legislation work towards the implementation of some of the recommendations but their recommendation identified additional changes necessary to best protect community safety and civil liberties.,48,,
381,0.97,3285.949,3294.157,They ask we continue to start working towards addressing those additional changes.,48,,
382,0.97,3294.157,3304.734,"So, everybody is clear on the process if this bill becomes law what happens next is SPD would draft policy revisions within 30 days.",48,,
383,0.97,3304.734,3305.201,"I'm sorry, 60 days.",48,,
384,0.97,3305.201,3314.21,The DOJ and the monitor would review the policy revision and that is when their formal review on the consent decree takes place.,48,,
385,0.97,3314.21,3330.293,The court then reviews the policy revision and if the court APPROVES then revised policies of the bill take effect.,48,,
386,0.97,3330.293,3357.387,"Um, so looking forward to--the culmination of many, many months of work begun with Council member Sawant's legislation passed unanimously by the Council last June and continued over the course of the year in my committee and really appreciate the collaboration from the other public safety and human services committee members on this bill.",48,,
387,0.97,3357.387,3366.93,Second item on today's agenda as mentioned is the parking enforcement officer transfer out of Seattle police Department.,48,,
388,0.97,3366.93,3427.924,"In late may this year--[Indiscernible] at that time due to a divide work force and Council members wanting additional time to deliberate on the--what is the proper home of the parking enforcement officers, we removed the parking enforcement officer unit from the bill and transferred just the 911 dispatch to the community safety and communication center while also passing an extension to the pro--darn allow them pro--continue to allow them to get paid.",48,,
389,0.97,3427.924,3464.127,Givn that although the park enforcement officer unit and the--the folks over at pro Tech 17 who represents the supervisors at the--park enforcement division have begun to meet to discuss their differences between the preferences of the super Visors represented by pro Tech and the preferences of the PEO officers represented.,48,,
390,0.97,3464.127,3489.953,There is still a divided work force but I have heard clearly a committee that more Council members are interested in transferring the parking enforcement officers to the Seattle Department of transportation so for that reason the bill as passed out of committee unanimously does transfer the parking enforcement officer unit to the Seattle Department of transportation.,48,,
391,0.97,3489.953,3494.657,That is the bill that we will have before us.,48,,
392,0.97,3494.657,3503.833,Quick update from the human services Department on their heat response.,48,,

397,0.97,3583.88,3598.962,The governor and the state health are creating a vaccine data verification tool that will help must considering our opportunities in the area of vaccine verification.,48,,
398,0.97,3598.962,3619.449,"As raised by Council President Gonzalez, the public health Department has limited enforcement mechanisms.",48,,
399,0.97,3619.449,3652.215,Mask mandate the city and county did use joint enforcement team for--[Indiscernible] we are looking to see whether or not--the function would be something that would be of use for vaccine verification purposes.,48,,
400,0.97,3652.215,3662.191,"Again it is time to take every precaution possible to avoid overwhelming the hospitals, emergency room and health care workers.",48,,
401,0.97,3662.191,3667.43,This includes masking up this public spaces and of course getting Vaccinated.,48,,
402,0.97,3667.43,3682.011,"Of the 1.4 million residents fully Vaccinated in King County, 0.004% have been hospitalized for Covid-19 in just 0.001% have died due to Covid-19.",48,,

404,0.97,3688.651,3691.921,If you know someone Unvaccinated please encourage them to get Vaccinated.,48,,
405,0.97,3691.921,3702.198,This is our best defense against Delta variant.,48,,
