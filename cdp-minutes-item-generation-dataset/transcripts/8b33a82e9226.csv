68,0.97,445.511,451.617,This means transferring the funds to Participatory budgeting.,14,,
69,0.97,451.617,454.487,We need police budget accountability now.,14,,
70,0.97,454.487,462.261,Anything less than 5.4 going toward Participatory budgeting would betray that commitment.,14,,

81,0.97,526.792,533.733,City Council needs to hold SPD accountable and transfer these funds to Participatory budgeting.,16,,
82,0.97,533.733,535.001,Anything else would betray that commitment.,16,,
83,0.97,535.001,538.237,It would also betray the true needs of our community.,16,,
84,0.97,538.237,541.741,"Please, I'm something the city Council to show leadership here.",16,,
85,0.97,541.741,544.844,"This is our chance, and help build back trust from our community.",16,,

92,0.97,569.869,581.08,"If you intend to hold SPD accountable to its overtime budget, which you expressed in 31962, you must then hold SPD accountable to its overtime budget.",18,,
93,0.97,581.08,584.784,Today is the day that you must provide budget accountability.,18,,
94,0.97,584.784,592.925,"If SPD does not respect the budget you set for them, how will you expect them to respect any of the other asks you have made of them?",18,,

112,0.97,682.615,694.927,"And the reason we don't have enough resources, is Y'all won't take the resources from the most useless unit in our city, that is the SPD.",20,,
113,0.97,694.927,699.165,They can't just do whatever they wasn't.,20,,

131,0.97,771.57,774.106,This actually increases SPD's spending authority.,22,,
132,0.97,774.106,777.176,Section 2 removes less than $3 million from SPD.,22,,
133,0.97,777.176,791.056,"Section 3 immediately gives some of that money back to SPD, and section 5 Affectful grants SPD $5 million spending authority that it did not previously have.",22,,

178,0.97,1032.03,1042.674,"Part of this commitment was resolution 31962, which stated that they would not grant funding for overtime.",28,,
179,0.97,1042.674,1054.153,"City Council needs to hold SPD accountable by reducing SPD's 2021 budget by the full $5.4 million, and transferring the funds to Participatory budgeting.",28,,
180,0.97,1054.153,1057.089,We need police budget accountability now.,28,,
181,0.97,1057.089,1080.145,"Anything less than $5.4 million, or going anywhere else than Participatory budgeting would be try that commitment and the community, who heard the commitment of all of the city council members to do this and the $5.4 million as I recall was all for overtime, which was so much time of police Brutalizing protesters during the uprising this summer.",28,,
182,0.97,1080.145,1084.817,And this money needs to go to Participatory budgeting.,28,,
183,0.97,1084.817,1085.05,Thanks.,28,,

196,0.97,1139.905,1153.318,"That's why we supported counsel's commitment this fall to not granting excess overtime, and instead shift to community led public solutions.",34,,
197,0.97,1153.318,1161.76,"That's why I'm calling today, to urge you to pass Council bill 11981 without comment.",34,,
198,0.97,1161.76,1167.466,S PD should be held accountable to its budget.,34,,
199,0.97,1167.466,1173.605,So continuing to facilitate gross overtime budget is just fiscally irresponsible.,34,,
200,0.97,1173.605,1182.181,"After police brutalized protesters last year, including folks I love, holding them accountable for this overtime spending that pays for this is the bare minimum.",34,,
201,0.97,1182.181,1190.389,Taking $5.4 million out of SPD's 2021 budget shows Council is serious about police budget accountability.,34,,
202,0.97,1190.389,1204.303,"And shifting this money stored Participatory budgeting, shows that Council is serious about shifting.",34,,
203,0.97,1204.303,1213.712,"Thank you, the next Speaker is Deandre Doke, followed by Yanna Butler.",35,,

206,0.97,1217.983,1218.617,You're doing this backwards.,36,,
207,0.97,1218.617,1227.426,"I've worked in public safety for the better part of a decade, and one of the odd things you do, is you do try to create a world in which you're no longer needed.",36,,
208,0.97,1227.426,1232.464,"I'd love to live in a world where the police are no longer needed, but that is not Seattle today.",36,,
209,0.97,1232.464,1236.735,You took it upon yourselves to offer an alternative.,36,,
210,0.97,1236.735,1242.174,"In the words of Councilmember Gonzalez, communities supported public safety centered on harm reduction.",36,,
211,0.97,1242.174,1252.384,"If there's no rehabilitation program for the person injecting heroin and the alcoves for business to go to, then I don't see a reduction.",36,,
212,0.97,1252.384,1255.587,Someone having a behavioral action certainly prompts a 911 call to the city.,36,,
213,0.97,1255.587,1266.231,"But when the fire Department won't go, Paramedics won't go, and instead the police are expected to go to address a noncriminal issue.",36,,

215,0.97,1274.64,1275.707,You are not replacing them.,36,,
216,0.97,1275.707,1280.145,You are hurting the very communities you are trying to help.,36,,
217,0.97,1280.145,1290.188,"He hair calls for fair, Nonbias policing, Antiracist policies, equity, empathy, transparency, and justice, not no police.",36,,
218,0.97,1290.188,1295.494,I hope you were listening to deputy Washington last week.,36,,
219,0.97,1295.494,1300.999,"When I Call911, I expect someone to show up, and to be treated with respect and integrity.",36,,

229,0.97,1340.539,1350.182,"911 response rates are terrible, in fact, often students call 911 and no one appears.",38,,

236,0.97,1379.478,1383.448,"As an alliance, we do not support this Defunding initiative.",38,,
237,0.97,1383.448,1394.059,"In fact, we believe that Defunding the police is what has gotten us to the extraordinary egregious public safety position that the U Dub students face today.",38,,
238,0.97,1394.059,1404.803,"We firmly believe that it will result in furthering the public safety crisis, and is tantamount to malpractice.",38,,

252,0.97,1461.66,1472.771,I'm part of a growing number of downtown residents and business owners who are sick and tire of watching our great city decline.,40,,

258,0.97,1486.484,1488.854,Store windows are boarded up.,40,,

264,0.97,1515.881,1519.451,No wonder the police have a hard time.,40,,
265,0.97,1519.451,1523.722,The Nordstrom windows were broken again by a man who had 78 prior arrests.,40,,

271,0.97,1551.783,1556.454,I'm stating my opposition to further cuts in 2021.,42,,
272,0.97,1556.454,1561.559,The data on the January 6th memo from the budget manager showed several disturbing trends.,42,,
273,0.97,1561.559,1568.266,"First, there was a significant increase in the departure of officers and associated accept raise cause.",42,,
274,0.97,1568.266,1573.972,"Other impacts included diversion of staff, delayed call handling, and others.",42,,

277,0.97,1584.749,1590.388,"This proposed ordinance does not acknowledge any of the recommendations, or the consequences to public safety.",42,,
278,0.97,1590.388,1599.798,"I also believe the Council is pursuing an approach that is at odds with moves towards the goals that I, and hopefully most of Seattle residents share.",42,,
279,0.97,1599.798,1609.574,"I acknowledge the need for police reform, including additional training, which actually may be negatively impacted by budget restrictions.",42,,

346,0.97,1934.766,1935.4,A U Dub student.,50,,
347,0.97,1935.4,1942.607,"I just want to say, never heard the U Dub parent safety alliance, nor do I agree with their analysis.",50,,
348,0.97,1942.607,1948.813,"In our U district, most of our concerns come from the Houselessness crisis, which police are not the solution too.",50,,
349,0.97,1948.813,1962.994,"All they do, spending overtime on this, is sweep camps from point a to point B to point C, rather than funding shelters or solving the problem.",50,,
350,0.97,1962.994,1972.87,"So I support Cb119981 to transfer $5.4 million out of SPD, into Participatory budgeting, and I do not support a watered down version of this bill.",50,,
351,0.97,1972.87,1978.276,This $5.4 million is nothing in the face of their total overtime spend.,50,,
352,0.97,1978.276,1981.012,"Look, Seattle is hooked on its police budget.",50,,
353,0.97,1981.012,1998.563,"We are addicted to increasing it year over year, using whatever flimsy evidence.",50,,
354,0.97,1998.563,2001.966,"No one would say, you can increase our budget, no.",50,,
355,0.97,2001.966,2006.704,They can make it look like every penny of these dollars are justified.,50,,
356,0.97,2006.704,2013.945,"We are addicted to increasing the budget, even when we are not even sure that it will some our problems.",50,,
357,0.97,2013.945,2028.359,"So let's allocate those funds to Participatory budget, so that we as a community can get together, and figure out how to some these crises that are been facing our community --",50,,
358,0.97,2028.359,2029.26,Thank you.,51,,
359,0.97,2029.26,2033.231,Flora Wright will be followed by Alice.,51,,
360,0.97,2033.231,2033.531,Hello.,52,,
361,0.97,2033.531,2034.031,I'm flora Wright.,52,,
362,0.97,2034.031,2050.882,A resident of district 3. I'm calling to ask city Council to pass the original version of Cb119981 to reduce SPD's 2021 budget by the full $5.4 million that they Overspent in 2020.,52,,
363,0.97,2050.882,2054.652,These funds should be allocated to Participatory budgeting.,52,,
364,0.97,2054.652,2060.691,"Last year, you promised you would take the same $5.4 million out of the budget to hold them accountable.",52,,
365,0.97,2060.691,2082.013,"If you back down now, and vote for Councilmember Herbold's substitute version, it would be a slap in the face to the over 150 organizations that have fought for Participatory budgeting, including black research, which has worked to make it a reality in Seattle.",52,,
366,0.97,2082.013,2091.889,"This comes after Councilmember Herbold quote the best way I can think of, Unquote, to hold SPD accountable for its overrun.",52,,
367,0.97,2091.889,2100.097,"Honor your commitment, and pass Council bill 118981.",52,,
368,0.97,2100.097,2107.572,"To reduce any less than $5.4 million, or transfer the funds would betray your promise.",52,,
369,0.97,2107.572,2108.439,Thank you.,52,,
370,0.97,2108.439,2115.513,"Thank you, our next Speaker is Alice followed by Truwana.",53,,

372,0.97,2116.581,2119.951,I'm a resident of district 2.,54,,
373,0.97,2119.951,2131.796,"I'm calling all to support Cb119981, in the original version that grants $5.4 million to Participatory budgeting.",54,,
374,0.97,2131.796,2138.903,"Councilmember Herbold, you highlighted that SPD's request has nothing to do with their staffing shortage, and you pointed out the hiring has been funded since November.",54,,
375,0.97,2138.903,2151.983,"So I'm hearing a lot of people were concerned about Defunding the police and what that means, but actually this money would not resolve that situation, and it's actually about budget accountability.",54,,
376,0.97,2151.983,2153.384,The situation is really Clear- cut.,54,,
377,0.97,2153.384,2155.186,Spd had a budget.,54,,
378,0.97,2155.186,2156.354,They decided to Overspend it.,54,,
379,0.97,2156.354,2163.761,The Council needs to hold them accountable.,54,,
380,0.97,2163.761,2172.503,"If you don't hold them accountable, this will continue every year.",54,,
381,0.97,2172.503,2177.275,That's large than the whole Department for the neighborhoods.,54,,
382,0.97,2177.275,2184.382,"1.8 times the budget of economic development, and nearly three times the budget [inaudible] the list goes on.",54,,
383,0.97,2184.382,2200.598,"Also talking about the budget for overtime alone, which is 10% less than their budget.",54,,
384,0.97,2200.598,2210.641,Looks like we lost you a little bit here.,55,,
385,0.97,2210.641,2220.918,Are you still with us?,55,,
386,0.97,2220.918,2221.919,"Hi, I'm Trawana.",56,,
387,0.97,2221.919,2227.625,I'm here as a voice of the black community for change.,56,,
388,0.97,2227.625,2232.83,It is time Seattle invest in community needs and harm reduction programs.,56,,
389,0.97,2232.83,2242.64,I'm calling on the Council to pass the original version to reduce the Seattle police Department's budget by the full $5.4 million that SPD Overspent in 2020.,56,,
390,0.97,2242.64,2246.51,Those funds need to be reallocated to community needs.,56,,
391,0.97,2246.51,2252.116,"Last year, city council made a commitment to reduce.",56,,
392,0.97,2252.116,2266.831,Part of the commitment was resolution was stated that the city council would not grand SPD additional funding to cover excess overtime.,56,,
393,0.97,2266.831,2270.067,"Spd defied this resolution, which city council granted.",56,,
394,0.97,2270.067,2289.62,"City Council needs to hold SPD accountable, by reducing the budget by the full $5.4 million and transfer that into Participatory budgeting, anything less than the $5.4 million is a betrayal.",56,,
395,0.97,2289.62,2290.888,It would betray that commitment.,56,,
396,0.97,2290.888,2295.76,And I yield the rest of my time.,56,,
397,0.97,2295.76,2297.862,Thank you.,57,,
398,0.97,2297.862,2306.57,Next is Diana glaze followed by Kwan Lou.,57,,
399,0.97,2306.57,2317.448,I'm Diana glaze from district 2. reform is simply a code word for more money for the unaccountable police.,58,,
400,0.97,2317.448,2322.92,"Last year, a super majority of Council agreed to Defund the police by at least 50%.",58,,
401,0.97,2322.92,2336.333,The use of super majority to overturn Mayor Durkan's veto to Defund the black lives matter program that led to Cb119981 is funding.,58,,
402,0.97,2336.333,2343.074,Pass the original bill to invest $5.4 million into Participatory budgeting for true community safety.,58,,
403,0.97,2343.074,2343.441,Thank you.,58,,
404,0.97,2343.441,2344.308,I yield my time.,58,,

413,0.97,2380.578,2392.156,"I'd just like to say I'm black, and I was never surveyed by anyone.",60,,
414,0.97,2392.156,2395.493,[inaudible] that violates the city charter and the Constitution.,60,,
415,0.97,2395.493,2404.268,"Every Councilmember took an oath to protect the citizens by enhancing health, safety, environment and the general welfare.",60,,
416,0.97,2404.268,2412.243,And also that each sector should have adequate police protection.,60,,
417,0.97,2412.243,2414.345,We've lost over 200 police officers here.,60,,
418,0.97,2414.345,2427.091,"A lot of the special units have had to be disbanded, and it's no follow up for domestic violence, narcotics or any of the other traffic cases that's out there.",60,,
419,0.97,2427.091,2437.168,"But more overly, no one is talking about the escalation of crime, and also all the mothers crying because their children were killed this year.",60,,
420,0.97,2437.168,2442.306,"Last year, 21 children were killed in Seattle, and there's no movement to try to solve any of those crimes.",60,,
421,0.97,2442.306,2457.721,"So you took an oath to protect the city, number 1, and number 2, we actually do agree with the judge and the judge has already warned [inaudible] the consent decree.",60,,
422,0.97,2457.721,2466.764,"I think a lot of this could have been avoided saying some of the things the community wants can be done now, and some other things can't be done.",60,,
423,0.97,2466.764,2474.238,A lot of the Councilmembers knew that Seattle was still under the consent decree.,60,,
424,0.97,2474.238,2475.573,"Thank you, Reverend Walden.",61,,
425,0.97,2475.573,2485.649,Our next Speaker that we have signed up here is Penny O'Grady.,61,,

431,0.97,2506.837,2511.175,A resolution means that a course of action is decided upon firmly.,62,,
432,0.97,2511.175,2516.614,Your resolution reflects that you were prepared for the Seattle police Department to be over budget.,62,,
433,0.97,2516.614,2516.947,They were.,62,,
434,0.97,2516.947,2518.082,The police require firm Guardrails.,62,,
435,0.97,2518.082,2523.554,It's the best way I can think of to hold them accountable is how we hold the line.,62,,
436,0.97,2523.554,2528.726,"Keep your word, and pass the original Cb118981.",62,,
437,0.97,2528.726,2538.903,Reduce the Spd2021 budget by the full $5.4 million that it Overspent in 2020.,62,,
438,0.97,2538.903,2543.474,It will address some of the problems in our city that some of the callers have described.,62,,
439,0.97,2543.474,2549.58,"We need a better solution, which is Participatory budgeting.",62,,
440,0.97,2549.58,2555.119,What other city Department has given us have to spend without accountability.,62,,
441,0.97,2555.119,2556.854,Police accountability means accountability in every manner.,62,,

480,0.97,2731.361,2743.14,I believe that passing the original version of Cb119981 is an opportunity to lead Seattle in transferring funds to community led safety programs.,71,,
481,0.97,2743.14,2752.082,"We know SPD has been fully funded since November, and has $7.7 million in additional savings from 2020.",71,,
482,0.97,2752.082,2759.056,We also know that 911 response times in 2020 are continuous with trends over the past two decades.,71,,
483,0.97,2759.056,2763.927,Everyone calling in today is asking for the same basic Úprinciples.,71,,

485,0.97,2770.167,2771.468,That's what we're discussing.,71,,
486,0.97,2771.468,2780.21,"Building out sustainable, well Researched community response systems will take time, but $5.4 million will not significantly change SPD's capacity.",71,,
487,0.97,2780.21,2788.852,These funds will be much better spent addressing Seattle's housing income and racial inequity crises that are making people unsafe.,71,,
488,0.97,2788.852,2793.69,This vote is the step forward that we need now.,71,,

503,0.97,2869.366,2874.071,Passing this Council bill will be just going the wrong direction.,73,,
504,0.97,2874.071,2879.977,We should be increasing capacity for the police Department rather than reducing it.,73,,
505,0.97,2879.977,2883.38,But making reform within the Department.,73,,
506,0.97,2883.38,2884.548,A Department that has proper resources.,73,,
507,0.97,2884.548,2891.021,We should also be dealing with the city and county prosecutors to take criminals off the streets.,73,,
508,0.97,2891.021,2893.29,Right now they roam free on the streets.,73,,
509,0.97,2893.29,2903.6,"My wife and I are not safe in our neighborhood, and it's, as taxpayers, this is not what we should be paying for.",73,,

520,0.97,2943.607,2948.545,But we have great assets that we need to tap through this process.,75,,
521,0.97,2948.545,2962.359,I'm calling to ask city Council to pass the original version of Cb119981 to reduce the Seattle police Department's 2021 budget by the full $5.4 million that SPD Overspent in 2020.,75,,
522,0.97,2962.359,2972.936,"These funds should be allocated to Participatory budgeting, and placing decision making on those impacted by violence.",75,,

525,0.97,2980.911,2984.881,It is a strategy toward a Reimagined world.,75,,
526,0.97,2984.881,2991.488,"Last year, city council made a commitment to shift resources from SPD to community solutions.",75,,
527,0.97,2991.488,3002.799,"Part of this commitment was resolution 31962, which stated CTY Council would not grant Spb additional funding to cover excess overtime.",75,,
528,0.97,3002.799,3005.936,"Asking city council for more money, which city council granted.",75,,
529,0.97,3005.936,3022.519,City Council needs to honor its commitments to the people of Seattle and hold SPD accountable by reducing SPD's 2020 budget by the full $5.4 million.,75,,
530,0.97,3022.519,3028.291,We need to keep our commitments to our black and Brown communities.,75,,

534,0.97,3050.313,3056.586,The SPD has proven over and over again that they do not provide any kind of meaningful public safety.,77,,

537,0.97,3072.669,3078.975,They have provided Copeious pages of explanations.,77,,
538,0.97,3078.975,3083.78,To reward SPD's egregious use of overtime is a complete betrayal.,77,,
539,0.97,3083.78,3087.484,Please have the courage to reject the system that is not working.,77,,
540,0.97,3087.484,3088.718,This system Maims and murders people.,77,,
541,0.97,3088.718,3094.291,"It's racist to its core, and has been for hundreds of years.",77,,

552,0.97,3172.302,3176.74,"This is not due to Covid-19, or the riots of last summer.",80,,
553,0.97,3176.74,3181.478,It is because there is no police presence downtown.,80,,

560,0.97,3212.275,3214.844,You have a responsibility towards voters like me.,80,,
561,0.97,3214.844,3219.015,The answer is not to cut the police budget.,80,,
562,0.97,3219.015,3233.196,It is your responsibility to put a robust police presence on downtown's streets.,80,,
563,0.97,3233.196,3234.965,Thank you.,81,,

566,0.97,3244.541,3249.279,Hi my name is Marcus Puckett.,82,,
567,0.97,3249.279,3253.116,I live in district 3. I heard some weird things brought up.,82,,
568,0.97,3253.116,3258.154,Solutions exist but can't get funding by someone that claims to work in the public safety center.,82,,
569,0.97,3258.154,3270.266,There are plenty of solutions that exist that can't get funding because police hog like all of their funding.,82,,
570,0.97,3270.266,3276.906,Without Defunding the application we can't adequately address the issues that everyone is complaining about in here.,82,,
571,0.97,3276.906,3280.91,Somebody brought up that Defunding the police has led to these problems.,82,,
572,0.97,3280.91,3285.248,"We haven't Defunded the police ever in this city, so I don't know what you're talking about.",82,,
573,0.97,3285.248,3291.154,This all comes down to your do you think that the Seattle police Department owns you?,82,,
574,0.97,3291.154,3294.557,Or do you care about what your constituents want.,82,,
575,0.97,3294.557,3301.297,So that's really what it comes down to.,82,,
576,0.97,3301.297,3308.104,Like the Seattle police Department recklessly abuses their overtime policies.,82,,
577,0.97,3308.104,3319.282,"There is a lot of evidence and you know, if this is what Y'all care about, why do you bother being city council members?",82,,
578,0.97,3319.282,3319.816,I yield my time.,82,,
579,0.97,3319.816,3320.317,Thank you.,83,,
580,0.97,3320.317,3325.689,And I think we have time for one more Speaker.,83,,

583,0.97,3336.099,3341.805,But we did extend the time significantly today.,83,,
584,0.97,3341.805,3343.84,I appreciate everybody being here.,83,,
585,0.97,3343.84,3346.109,We will end with Madison Bowden.,83,,

590,0.97,3359.522,3361.758,I will be discussing police violence and murder.,86,,
591,0.97,3361.758,3372.469,I urge the Council to pass the original version of the budgetary bill without the amendments and to Defund SPD by the full $5.4 million that they Overspent in 2020.,86,,
592,0.97,3372.469,3379.743,A few weeks ago on the anniversary of the murder of Breonna Taylor by police.,86,,

594,0.97,3395.558,3400.597,We cannot continue to reward this abhorrent behavior of the police Department.,86,,
595,0.97,3400.597,3404.567,What does it say to minority groups when the city continues to consider this acceptable.,86,,
596,0.97,3404.567,3410.106,"As a Trans woman, I do not feel safe when SPD officers are around.",86,,
597,0.97,3410.106,3411.674,I fear for my personal safety.,86,,
598,0.97,3411.674,3419.416,This fear would be alleviated if I knew our city was working to ensure the accountability of the police Department.,86,,
599,0.97,3419.416,3432.395,I urge you to pass Cb119981 Unamended to reduce the police Department budget by the full $5.4 million that it Overspent in 2020.,86,,
600,0.97,3432.395,3432.829,Thank you.,86,,

613,0.97,3484.247,3484.481,Yes.,90,,
614,0.97,3484.481,3485.014,Fantastic.,91,,

621,0.97,3498.595,3509.806,"I had the opportunity to review your annual report when it came out electronically, and saw a number of things that certainly interest me.",93,,
622,0.97,3509.806,3520.416,"You know, not just the response to the pandemic, but some of the other things that you've been doing and thought it would be a great opportunity to have you come and present to us.",93,,
623,0.97,3520.416,3522.151,So thanks for being here.,93,,
624,0.97,3522.151,3523.052,"Yeah, you bet.",94,,
625,0.97,3523.052,3529.259,"First of all, thank you Council President Gonzalez, and Chairperson Herbold.",94,,
626,0.97,3529.259,3533.363,I so appreciate the opportunity to be here with you today.,94,,
627,0.97,3533.363,3537.4,"Curry Mayer, office of emergency management director.",94,,
628,0.97,3537.4,3575.638,"And I'm also super excited that you wanted to hear about our annual report because not only has emergency management been involved in, of course, response to the pandemic, which has, you know, impacted our lives in so many crazy ways, all areas of our lives, but really everything about the crazy things that happened all over the city for the last year or so, and the things that we do on a regular basis to Engain the community, work with our business partners and all of those communities that make up the diverse place that Seattle is.",94,,
629,0.97,3575.638,3588.384,"So I've asked my deputy director to join me today, and she will be doing the bulk of the presentation, because she spent the majority of last year actually involved in the work.",94,,
630,0.97,3588.384,3590.687,I didn't come on until December.,94,,
631,0.97,3590.687,3598.294,"Even though I was a neighbor and knew what was going on, I thought it best to have her speak with you directly about the engagement.",94,,
632,0.97,3598.294,3608.271,But I'm also here for questions or anything else I can help with Maybe that's not in the report that you'd like to hear after that.,94,,
633,0.97,3608.271,3610.106,"So I will mute, but I'll stay here.",94,,
634,0.97,3610.106,3616.312,"So thank you very much, again, for the opportunity, and then I'll pass it to Laurel.",94,,
635,0.97,3616.312,3618.414,"Great, thank you, curry.",95,,
636,0.97,3618.414,3620.717,"Thank Councilmember Herbold, and fellow Councilmembers and the community.",95,,
637,0.97,3620.717,3628.825,Appreciate the opportunity to be here this morning to share as we have done in the past.,95,,
638,0.97,3628.825,3634.53,"You know, we've given insight to the office of management for years.",95,,
639,0.97,3634.53,3637.266,"First off, I never managed myself being in the position that I was last year.",95,,
640,0.97,3637.266,3650.346,"We were on the heels of losing a very seasoned well Respectedmental management director, Barb graph and the hopes of having a new director at the point.",95,,
641,0.97,3650.346,3677.073,"When she departed, unfortunately, that didn't happen when she retired in February, so here I am, and just want to reflect on a year that to me created a lot of adversity and also learned that there's strength in adversity, and you probably picked up some of my personal things that I dealt with myself last year, that were just as challenges as many other community members and many of you have experienced.",95,,
642,0.97,3677.073,3686.883,So I'm going to go ahead and share my screen here to get the report up on the screen.,95,,
643,0.97,3686.883,3688.284,Okay.,95,,
644,0.97,3688.284,3689.252,Hopefully you should see that.,95,,
645,0.97,3689.252,3715.978,"So I want to just kick off, you know last year was a year I know we hear this term unprecedented, but it clearly was a year that, in my 25 year career in emergency management, I never managed we would be facing what we faced last year, and there are lots of things that we had to face personally, and professionally, and I know each and every one of us had to experience that in some way or form.",95,,
646,0.97,3715.978,3723.719,"So it was a year that, you know, also we were dealing with, as I mentioned, the retirement of our director, Barb graph.",95,,
647,0.97,3723.719,3738.067,"So it's never easy to face change, and that had an imprint on a number of us, myself included, who I'd worked with Barb for 13 years, as well as the rest of our team, and our colleagues that have been in emergency management.",95,,
648,0.97,3738.067,3745.108,"So I want to kick off, first off, thank you to the Council and to Mayor Durkan.",95,,
649,0.97,3745.108,3755.952,"There were many things that came up last year with all the events that occurred, and one of those was the Fort to move the office of emergency management out of the police Department.",95,,
650,0.97,3755.952,3772.735,"I think a lot of people didn't realize when he were in the police Department, because we try to see ourselves Nondenominational, where we try to look at partnerships and looking at all functions and disciplines.",95,,
651,0.97,3772.735,3779.642,"We are now officially our own Department, which is in its first time history for the office of management in the city of Seattle.",95,,
652,0.97,3779.642,3783.946,This will be the first time that we are actually our own independent office.,95,,
653,0.97,3783.946,3786.682,"So again, thank you for the support.",95,,
654,0.97,3786.682,3798.227,"We're still working through all the idiosyncrasies of what that looks like for us to be an independent office as you can imagine, but appreciate the support on that.",95,,
655,0.97,3798.227,3813.042,"Laurel, can you just give us sort of a sense of a flavor of what you mean when you refer to the steps that you're taking to become an independent office?",96,,
656,0.97,3813.042,3818.181,"What steps have already been taken, and what are the next steps in the horizon?",96,,
657,0.97,3818.181,3822.118,"Yeah, I appreciate that question, Councilmember Herbold.",97,,
658,0.97,3822.118,3836.732,"For us, we had been in the police Department at least, I think the last '90s, and subsequently with that came all of the fiscal budgetary, hr support, et cetera.",97,,
659,0.97,3836.732,3845.708,"So once we became independent, we had to look at ways to continue how we do those types of normal business functions on a day-to-day basis.",97,,
660,0.97,3845.708,3859.255,So we've been working with the Finance administrative services Department and the Seattle Department.,97,,
661,0.97,3859.255,3864.293,We get a lot of grants to help support resiliency in the city of Seattle and in the community.,97,,
662,0.97,3864.293,3870.466,Therefore that means that we've got a lot of grant management that we need to do.,97,,
663,0.97,3870.466,3879.542,"So when we lost that type of support with SPD, we had to bolster that up with what we need to do.",97,,
664,0.97,3879.542,3882.078,"We are still navigating that, Councilmember Herbold.",97,,
665,0.97,3882.078,3892.788,"We're looking to add a position on board, so we can give that body of work, fully fledged into a grant management type of body of work.",97,,
666,0.97,3892.788,3901.197,"So we're a little thin right now, but we're navigating that, and we're making sure we have resources in order to do that.",97,,
667,0.97,3901.197,3905.568,All of our hr support is through the Seattle Department of human resources.,97,,
668,0.97,3905.568,3910.373,"That too, has been a body of work as you know.",97,,
669,0.97,3910.373,3925.488,"We're working with a lot of FEMA Reimbursment work, which our office has always done, but our work has been unprecedented, monumental, and very complex and dynamic.",97,,
670,0.97,3925.488,3931.36,We're working through a lot of steps to get staff Onboard to help us through that process.,97,,
671,0.97,3931.36,3955.418,"The other thing, I am so tickled that we now have a new director on board, curry Mayer, who I had known through the city of Bellevue, and through a national search, it was great to get someone on board that we know from the region, and curry has an incredible background in city management.",97,,
672,0.97,3955.418,3973.936,"In addition, we had to hire a staff in a virtual environment, which is very different, and we were very fortunate to come on in the middle of last year, Kate Hutten, she comes from the city of Los Angeles, and has been an extraordinary asset for us.",97,,
673,0.97,3973.936,3991.554,"It was nice to get additional team members Onboard, and someone who has extensive [inaudible]. so as some of you know from past briefings that Barb had done, a typical year is that we would activate the emergency operations center 6 to 8 time as year.",97,,
674,0.97,3991.554,4000.896,"Last year proved to be quite different, and really had some hurdles and challenges on how we do that in a public health emergency.",97,,
675,0.97,4000.896,4015.344,"From the very Get-Go, and I'll talk a little bit here in a bit about Covid specifically, but early on, we had our activation for Covid-19, the Coronavirus on March 2ND is when we officially opened up the emergency operations center.",97,,
676,0.97,4015.344,4026.822,"As you'll see, we also had to face the Seattle bridge, West Seattle bridge that had some complications.",97,,
677,0.97,4026.822,4033.195,"We dealt with the activities in May through July, and supporting the city-wide coordination on that.",97,,
678,0.97,4033.195,4044.807,"We also this to deal with smoke, which we've had for numerous years now, and we also dealt with election activities in November, because a lot of the issues that were happening nationwide.",97,,
679,0.97,4044.807,4051.047,I'm going to dive into each of Hese to give you a Litt perspective.,97,,
680,0.97,4051.047,4061.39,"So on top of Covid in early March and activating for that, we learned from the Department of transportation that there were cracks that were showing up on the West Seattle bridge.",97,,
681,0.97,4061.39,4072.301,"Very quickly, we jumped in to coordination mode with Sdot and other critical city departments as well as the community and of the private sector.",97,,
682,0.97,4072.301,4084.58,"Our main role during this event was really to ensure that we had action plans in place to be able to respond if, for any reason, that bridge took more significant movement than we anticipated.",97,,
683,0.97,4084.58,4099.562,"And we also were responsible for ensuring that we could get alert, and warning information out to the community, especially those business areas that would be in direct impact of the bridge infrastructure itself.",97,,
684,0.97,4099.562,4107.87,"So we ended up recruiting and utilizing our ACS, or auxiliary communication services.",97,,
685,0.97,4107.87,4111.807,You've heard about them probably in the past.,97,,
686,0.97,4111.807,4132.228,"They're a great group of folks for these types of missions we actually deploy them out to the sites around the Seattle bridge impact area there on harbor Island and the businesses to make sure that when we do alert and warnings to that area, those businesses could get those alerts on their cell phones.",97,,
687,0.97,4132.228,4137.5,"So there's a system called the Wireless emergency alert system, Wea.",97,,
688,0.97,4137.5,4146.308,"And through the test in June, as well as doing a test in July, the first test?",97,,
689,0.97,4146.308,4153.415,In June gave us indication that not everyone was getting notified through the Wea system on their cell phones.,97,,
690,0.97,4153.415,4166.395,"So we had folks with different service providers like Verizon at & amp; T, T-Mobile, et cetera to make sure when we push out a test like that, that those folks were receiving it.",97,,
691,0.97,4166.395,4172.268,"Our first test on June 26th, we realized we had some holes and gaps.",97,,
692,0.97,4172.268,4180.843,"So we remedied that, and made the Polygon a much bigger Footprint.",97,,
693,0.97,4180.843,4194.957,"We did a second test on July 25th, which gave us success, to make sure if we had to do a Wea test, that particular Footprint would get notified that there was an eminent concern with the West Seattle bridge.",97,,
694,0.97,4194.957,4223.118,"So the other activities that we dealt with last year was I think, personally, and professionally, a very challenging tile, and it was personally, and professionally challenging for a number of us, who were in the emergency operations center, ensuring that we were doing the citywide coordination and helping to support the efforts and the public safety out there.",97,,
695,0.97,4223.118,4244.573,"So we saw the events unfortunate, you know, with George Floyd being killed, and all the activities that happened with that, so we also saw the events on May 30th, that caused us to be in a position to have the emergency operations center open for several weeks in response to those activities.",97,,
696,0.97,4244.573,4257.853,We were open for 15 days and you'll see we did a number of coordinated activities during that time with the various city departments and agencies in that time.,97,,
697,0.97,4257.853,4264.526,"I will make a note, when we were in the emergency operations center, we were physically there.",97,,
698,0.97,4264.526,4269.732,"We were, of course, practicing the appropriate social distancing, and the masking.",97,,
699,0.97,4269.732,4274.803,"We had no one get sick out of that activity, so thank goodness for that.",97,,
700,0.97,4274.803,4277.773,There was a number of coordinated activities that we did during that time.,97,,
701,0.97,4277.773,4282.778,There was a lot of businesses that were being impacted.,97,,
702,0.97,4282.778,4285.614,"So we dealt with debris, and graffiti clean up.",97,,
703,0.97,4285.614,4301.163,"We also looked at weighs and did a lot of collaboration with the private sector, as well as a number of departments to make sure that we're securing damaged storefronts downtown, and also in the International district.",97,,
704,0.97,4301.163,4320.182,"We tried to ensure that we had everything, information wise we could share with the office of economic development, who was the main point of contact to the businesses out in the impacted communities, as well as we provided logistical support, so there were Porta- Potties that were provided.",97,,
705,0.97,4320.182,4327.656,"We had Dumpsters that we had to deal with, and being able to support other activities, especially in the Cal Anderson park area.",97,,
706,0.97,4327.656,4332.061,So it was not an easy time as I mentioned.,97,,
707,0.97,4332.061,4336.365,"And I know, you know, there were extraordinary impacts during that incident.",97,,
708,0.97,4336.365,4341.236,But that was one of the activities that we dealt with during that time.,97,,
709,0.97,4341.236,4349.244,"Lastly, I'll just say on this, all of us saw the incredible March that happened on June 12th, which was a Friday.",97,,
710,0.97,4349.244,4364.093,"And we were in the emergency operations center doing our best to make sure that it was a safe March, and you know, there was well over, I think 60,000 people that participated in that particular March.",97,,
711,0.97,4364.093,4369.765,And so the result in a number of lessons learned from this particular event as well.,97,,
712,0.97,4369.765,4372.134,"Laurel, if we could just pause.",98,,
713,0.97,4372.134,4380.142,I see that Councilmember Sawant has her hand raised.,98,,
714,0.97,4380.142,4381.143,Councilmember Sawant.,98,,
715,0.97,4381.143,4381.977,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,99,,
716,0.97,4381.977,4386.615,If Laura could go back to the previous slide.,99,,
717,0.97,4386.615,4397.659,"I don't know if it's a question, it depends on the office of emergency management, if you want to take a question and provide a response, that will be definitely appreciated.",99,,
718,0.97,4397.659,4409.872,"But I just wanted to note, obviously this is a report from the office of emergency management, not from the police Department per se.",99,,
719,0.97,4409.872,4416.111,But the office of emergency management was housed in the Seattle police Department at the time.,99,,
720,0.97,4416.111,4429.491,"Every time Mayor Durkan declared an emergency, and in those days, if the first days of the protest, it was practically daily.",99,,
721,0.97,4429.491,4433.195,Obviously you've noticed several tasks that you were responsible for.,99,,
722,0.97,4433.195,4458.02,"But I have to say, this is not surprising to me, but in the interest of the public, I want to note how it's a sanitized version of what actually happen at that time, you're talking about coordination of debris, and graffiti clean up.",99,,
723,0.97,4458.02,4459.421,And Dumpsters were refused.,99,,
724,0.97,4459.421,4478.607,"But I think the most glaring thing in those days was the amount of public resources, public revenue that was spent on police overtime policing and violently policing peaceful protest.",99,,
725,0.97,4478.607,4487.015,"Seattle paid $6.9 million in overtime to the police during the first 12 days of the protest, and that was not the only example.",99,,
726,0.97,4487.015,4493.689,"In the same 12 days, New York City spent $115 million on police overtime.",99,,
727,0.97,4493.689,4496.158,Los Angele spent over $40 million in that same time.,99,,
728,0.97,4496.158,4515.444,"So this was happening in cities across the nation, where we had the most historic Street movement in America, and what was happening was the cities were spending millions of dollars over policing these protests.",99,,
729,0.97,4515.444,4527.756,"So I feel like this version really does not capture the actual events of those days, if you're providing a report, I think that should be the highlight, not these things.",99,,
730,0.97,4527.756,4530.125,But I just wanted to note that.,99,,
731,0.97,4530.125,4535.898,Obviously I recognize that the current director much OEM had been hired since then.,99,,
732,0.97,4535.898,4556.451,"So it's not a question of individual, it's not my comments towards any individual, but just to note that these reports really do not capture the realities that were faced by ordinary people and the tens of thousands of Seattleites that were protesting against police violence.",99,,
733,0.97,4556.451,4568.497,"So if I could jump in here really quickly, I think, so first of all, thank you for your comments, Councilperson.",100,,
734,0.97,4568.497,4572.301,I really appreciate you bringing that up.,100,,
735,0.97,4572.301,4582.578,"It really, I think, emphasizes the misunderstanding people have about what imagine management does.",100,,
736,0.97,4582.578,4589.451,It was really incredibly for us to be separated from the police Department.,100,,
737,0.97,4589.451,4612.307,"Emergency management is really a city wide resource, and our main function in any event, is to provide Situational awareness of what all city departments are doing, and all City resources, where they're located, what they're engaged in, and then that cross departmental coordination, and movement of resources to help people.",100,,
738,0.97,4612.307,4627.99,"So being in the police Department clouded that to some degree, because people, they thought, Oh, that's part of police, or they're doing police work in some fashion, when really, that's not, that's really not what we do.",100,,
739,0.97,4627.99,4631.693,So I don't know if that's helpful or not.,100,,
740,0.97,4631.693,4637.833,"I'm happy to answer other questions, or give it back to Laurel.",100,,
741,0.97,4637.833,4640.736,"I think it's really important to note, that we're not a police function.",100,,
742,0.97,4640.736,4650.679,"I understand that, and I appreciate the response, but it's like your talking about all city departments except the police Department.",101,,
743,0.97,4650.679,4656.351,"I mean, who empties the Dumpsters, it's not the emergency Department directly I assume.",101,,
744,0.97,4656.351,4657.452,It's not the police.,101,,
745,0.97,4657.452,4659.154,But you are talking about other departments.,101,,
746,0.97,4659.154,4661.723,But what's missing is the role of the police Department.,101,,
747,0.97,4661.723,4664.493,That's just what I wanted to note.,101,,
748,0.97,4664.493,4666.828,Thank you.,101,,
749,0.97,4666.828,4669.197,"All right, thank you.",102,,
750,0.97,4669.197,4669.431,Laurel.,102,,
751,0.97,4669.431,4669.698,Okay.,103,,
752,0.97,4669.698,4679.641,So the other event that we had to deal with last year which we've seen over the last number of years is the smoke that comes from the Wildland fires.,103,,
753,0.97,4679.641,4691.253,"And uniquely last year with Covid-19, it really caused, again, other issues and domino impacts, I guess.",103,,
754,0.97,4691.253,4713.675,"So very early on, even before September, pulled together the departments that are involved in this type of planning, such as the public health Department, the human services Department, the parks Department, the fire, public utilities, et cetera, and we really looked at, what could we do when smoke impacts the city of Seattle?",103,,
755,0.97,4713.675,4728.29,"So it clearly, through the conversations that our planner had with public health, it was determined through the advisement of public health, that really Covid had far more health risks and impacts than smoke.",103,,
756,0.97,4728.29,4731.626,So knowing that we couldn't do the cooling centers.,103,,
757,0.97,4731.626,4757.519,"Knowing that we couldn't do the congregate sheltering set UPS, we felt that we would approach it as if we needed to go down that route, we would look to public health to give us guidance, and be able to pivot our operations appropriately so that we could do any sheltering if needed, but those were sensitivities that we had to keep in mind for that particular planning effort.",103,,
758,0.97,4757.519,4765.927,Then most of last year as you all know really focused on the Covid response.,104,,
759,0.97,4765.927,4780.775,"And a couple things, last, I believe, January, or February, we were in front of the Council providing a briefing to everyone about the initial preparedness steps, that we as a city were taking.",104,,
760,0.97,4780.775,4789.184,"Back in 2008, 2009, the city had put together what we term a pandemic influenza plan.",104,,
761,0.97,4789.184,4795.824,That pandemic influenza plan had a number of planning assumptions.,104,,
762,0.97,4795.824,4800.695,It would address some of the human resource issues.,104,,
763,0.97,4800.695,4804.166,How would we do the overall communication?,104,,
764,0.97,4804.166,4807.035,How would we maintain our services in the city of Seattle?,104,,
765,0.97,4807.035,4826.188,"I think very quickly, when we saw the first case come in to the United States up in Snohomish county in late January, and we started to stand up our visit into that plan in February, we started to brush it off.",104,,
766,0.97,4826.188,4839.568,"We started to look at our continuity operations plan, we learned that pandemic flu plan had a lot of planning assumptions that weren't lining up with Covid.",104,,
767,0.97,4839.568,4851.379,So we spent the month of February spending twice a week planning sessions with all the city departments and some of our connecting agencies.,104,,
768,0.97,4851.379,4853.715,Transit was one of those.,104,,
769,0.97,4853.715,4857.285,Public health obviously was one of our subject matters.,104,,
770,0.97,4857.285,4868.063,"And started to figure out as the cases increase in the Puget sound region, and in the city of Seattle, how would we use some of the core elements of that plan to be able to respond?",104,,
771,0.97,4868.063,4879.641,"Before we knew it, the cases, as we all saw on the news, we made the decision to activate the emergency operations center on May 2ND.",104,,
772,0.97,4879.641,4880.542,The same thing.,104,,
773,0.97,4880.542,4885.881,We went through the same process of we were social distancing.,104,,
774,0.97,4885.881,4901.63,"We were masking appropriately in the Eoc, and then we have the governor's stay at home order 18th March 18th, and we all went virtual.",104,,
775,0.97,4901.63,4907.802,"I never imagined we would be doing a virtual activation, because it's so important on having face-to-face communication.",104,,
776,0.97,4907.802,4921.783,"That's why we have a space like an Eoc, so we Pivoted very quickly, and had to also pivot our procedures in how we function in a virtual environment.",104,,
777,0.97,4921.783,4934.329,"Thankfully, we have history in doing very successful coordination calls like when the Viaduct shifted a number of years ago, and we had to do spontaneous coordination on that.",104,,
778,0.97,4934.329,4937.032,"When the Viaduct was taken down, we did coordination calls.",104,,
779,0.97,4937.032,4941.936,"We had a history of doing that, so we were able to step into doing a virtual environment.",104,,
780,0.97,4941.936,4948.944,"I wouldn't say it was still easy, but we were able to put the procedures and the protocols in place.",104,,
781,0.97,4948.944,4957.452,"Also, during the month of February we were Loaning a couple of our staff duty officers to public health.",104,,
782,0.97,4957.452,4958.453,They were getting hammered.,104,,
783,0.97,4958.453,4977.005,"We were all, I don't think even imagined Covid would be what it was, and our staff duty officers were serving in the health and area medical command, to help them in any of their planning processes, as well as that Situational connection with our colleagues in public health.",104,,
784,0.97,4977.005,4988.783,"When we activated the emergency operations center from the very get go, as we were planning and getting it set up before March 2ND, we had established four functions.",104,,
785,0.97,4988.783,4994.089,And those four functions actually stay in place today.,104,,
786,0.97,4994.089,4997.025,But we established a public safety branch.,104,,
787,0.97,4997.025,4999.394,We established a city infrastructure branch.,104,,
788,0.97,4999.394,5002.797,"We established a homelessness, and human services branch.",104,,
789,0.97,5002.797,5005.767,We also established a community needs branch.,104,,
790,0.97,5005.767,5013.842,"Those became kind of our functional array of how we organized our self in our emergency operations center, or virtually.",104,,
791,0.97,5013.842,5031.192,"Those have stuck with us today, so many of our meetings still focus on these four buckets, as they're kind of termed and how we're managing Situational awareness.",104,,
792,0.97,5031.192,5031.393,Yes.,104,,
793,0.97,5031.393,5053.148,"I was wondering if you could include in your comments a little bit of an explanation of what was most challenging about, you know, you spoke to historically, although sometimes you will conference in individuals or calls.",105,,
794,0.97,5053.148,5056.384,"But historically, it's been very important for folks to meet face-to-face.",105,,
795,0.97,5056.384,5064.626,"If you could just sort of identify, what was most difficult about not meeting face-to-face and how you address that.",105,,
796,0.97,5064.626,5068.263,"Yeah, thank you Councilmember Herbold for that question.",106,,
797,0.97,5068.263,5087.949,"So when you're face-to-face, and you do stand up briefings, you can get everyone, and you can go around the Horn and ask fire what's going on for your particular function, public health, et cetera, and you can get that information verbally with one another.",106,,
798,0.97,5087.949,5096.791,"Because we're in a virtual environment, there were more processes that we had to put in place to basically Replicate that.",106,,
799,0.97,5096.791,5110.071,"So we ended up starting to do conference calls as part of our mix on how we were physically in the Eoc, and conference calls on those briefings and the stand up.",106,,
800,0.97,5110.071,5112.006,Technology works sometimes.,106,,
801,0.97,5112.006,5112.807,Technology didn't work sometimes.,106,,
802,0.97,5112.807,5125.22,"And we realized we had to have a very clear rhythm of how we orchestrated the feedback as we know in the virtual environment, it's sometimes challenging.",106,,
803,0.97,5125.22,5126.221,You don't see faces.,106,,
804,0.97,5126.221,5126.955,You don't hear people.,106,,
805,0.97,5126.955,5138.199,"People can have comments that they can add in at different times and in a virtual environment, or coordination calls, that makes it a little bit more challenging.",106,,
806,0.97,5138.199,5158.887,"Not only were people practiced on how to do that, but we had to basically take our procedures, and adjust them for those idiosyncrasies as we did those types of calls and tried to do that, Replicae that without being physically in the Eoc.",106,,
807,0.97,5158.887,5159.387,A couple other things.,106,,
808,0.97,5159.387,5162.857,"There were conference calls, I guess, to your point, Councilmember.",106,,
809,0.97,5162.857,5168.563,There were conference calls that we had well over 200 people on those calls.,106,,
810,0.97,5168.563,5187.448,"And you know, it made communication a little bit more challenging when you're not able to have people in the same space, so we had to make sure that we were very thoughtful about how collect that information, and push it out into our normal Snapshot reports, our Situational reports, et cetera.",106,,
811,0.97,5187.448,5197.192,"How do we make sure that we're convening the right planning sessions with people, and bringing them to the table, to make sure that we're planning.",106,,
812,0.97,5197.192,5205.9,"A term that I used last year, that probably some of you have probably used is I felt like we were building the airplane as we were trying to fly it.",106,,
813,0.97,5205.9,5207.302,And it was very challenging.,106,,
814,0.97,5207.302,5213.274,There were lots of policy issues that had to be made on the fly.,106,,
815,0.97,5213.274,5220.448,There were a lot of adaptations that we had to do on the fly.,106,,
816,0.97,5220.448,5232.694,"I think it was such a novel situation, that everything that you ground on, when it comes to policies and procedures almost went completely out the window, and we had to start afresh on everything.",106,,
817,0.97,5232.694,5241.603,"The other thing with Covid last year, is Covid is a very unique Federal Emergency management response.",106,,
818,0.97,5241.603,5255.149,"Fema, as far as I know, in my history, at least 25 years, and possibly for its entire history, FEMA typically doesn't deal with public health emergencies.",106,,
819,0.97,5255.149,5258.052,So this was such an anomaly.,106,,
820,0.97,5258.052,5275.336,"Everything that we, as tried and true officers are used to working with FEMA on flooding hazards, earthquakes, hurricanes, all of those natural hazards, this one also caused unique challenges, as well as really caused a significant body of work.",106,,
821,0.97,5275.336,5287.682,"So we have a team member on staff who normal day-to-day, normal winter weather events handles the FEMA reimbursement process, and the public assistance process.",106,,
822,0.97,5287.682,5296.557,"Vy never seen in my entire career, again how complex, high dynamic, and how challenging this whole FEMA process has been.",106,,
823,0.97,5296.557,5301.696,"So early on, you know, we had tried to make connections with our colleagues.",106,,
824,0.97,5301.696,5311.205,"We go through state, we go through County, and we go through state management, and they too were just as overwhelmed.",106,,
825,0.97,5311.205,5318.746,It was like this nexus that can be challenging and dynamic also happened on the FEMA reimbursement side.,106,,
826,0.97,5318.746,5326.821,"So as I mentioned earlier, we were working to get additional staff on hand.",106,,
827,0.97,5326.821,5330.825,We've been getting some staff to help us out in that process.,106,,
828,0.97,5330.825,5335.196,"Beyond Eric, brought millions of dollars into the city over the years.",106,,
829,0.97,5335.196,5344.472,"I think almost $41 million that we've brought into the city over the years for public assistance, reimbursement from FEMA.",106,,
830,0.97,5344.472,5350.411,"This is pretty monumental, so we're looking to make sure we've got resources to help support that.",106,,
831,0.97,5350.411,5359.554,"Also last year, with Covid, we knew that we were going to be facing a shortage with hospital status.",106,,
832,0.97,5359.554,5369.03,"And so we, early on worked with state emergency management, and through FEMA, established a field hospital.",106,,
833,0.97,5369.03,5381.843,"I can't speak loudly enough of all the assets that came into play for that through FEMA, and the National Guard, who helped support getting that set up.",106,,
834,0.97,5381.843,5383.244,I'm so impressed by that.,106,,
835,0.97,5383.244,5397.992,"Thankfully, you know, we did not need to use that facility, and we stood it up Proactively, and Thankfully didn't need to actually put patients in beds for that field hospital.",106,,
836,0.97,5397.992,5404.699,"The other things with Covid, as I mentioned earlier, we did do the pivoting of our operations.",106,,
837,0.97,5404.699,5404.999,All of us.,106,,
838,0.97,5404.999,5409.871,Every single person had to look at how we do things virtually in a business environment.,106,,
839,0.97,5409.871,5414.542,"Additionally, we did a lot of community outreach.",106,,
840,0.97,5414.542,5427.889,"And our community outreach team who many of you have heard us talk about in the past of all the activities that they do in normal business days, and normal disasters were very instrumental in our activities last year.",106,,
841,0.97,5427.889,5435.763,"So we have a team of what we call community safety ambassadors, and they speak different languages.",106,,
842,0.97,5435.763,5446.874,"Early last year, we had them actually team up with the office of economic development and the Department of neighborhoods.",106,,
843,0.97,5446.874,5461.856,"And nine of those CSA's, actually went out to 94 businesses, ensuring they were providing face coverings to small and minority owned businesses.",106,,
844,0.97,5461.856,5468.229,We leveraged that team to make sure we're providing information out there.,106,,
845,0.97,5468.229,5473.067,"We're also, for your awareness, doing an after action item aware front.",106,,
846,0.97,5473.067,5476.337,We were specifically focusing on our Covid after action.,106,,
847,0.97,5476.337,5478.806,It's been a year long activity.,106,,
848,0.97,5478.806,5488.95,"We Thankfully started early last year doing surveys on a Biweekly basis to get feedback, so people, you know, as overtime, you forget things.",106,,
849,0.97,5488.95,5489.484,We're collecting those.,106,,
850,0.97,5489.484,5500.962,"And towards the end of this year, we will have a final report that guides us on what did we learn from all of our response for Covid, from last year, to this year.",106,,
851,0.97,5500.962,5512.84,Then the lessons learned from that will also inform what we need to do to update our pandemic plan that we've got in place.,106,,
852,0.97,5512.84,5514.842,Another thing I've very happy about.,106,,
853,0.97,5514.842,5521.682,"Last year, amongst all the things that we had to do, we also are required to update our all hazards mitigation plan.",106,,
854,0.97,5521.682,5530.124,"It's a five year plan that goes through state, emergency management Approvement, as well as FEMA Approvement.",106,,
855,0.97,5530.124,5536.163,This particular plan allows us and Immediates to be in place to allow us to access mitigation funds.,106,,
856,0.97,5536.163,5542.403,"So last year, we were working through the process of updating that plan.",106,,
857,0.97,5542.403,5545.306,We also engaged the community to get their feedback.,106,,
858,0.97,5545.306,5557.084,We used our outreach team and our community Safetyambassadors to make sure we were getting feedback from the community.,106,,
859,0.97,5557.084,5563.357,Which is basically trying to lesson the impacts of disasters across the community.,106,,
860,0.97,5563.357,5565.192,That particular plan will come to Council.,106,,
861,0.97,5565.192,5572.033,"Just a heads up, it will probably come to Council in probably the Mayish Timeframe.",106,,
862,0.97,5572.033,5578.472,"So do know we're doing the touch UPS on that particular plan, and you'll see it shortly.",106,,
863,0.97,5578.472,5590.985,"A couple other things last year and continue this year is there is a building resilient infrastructure, and community grant that has been in place through FEMA.",106,,
864,0.97,5590.985,5592.42,It's been renamed.,106,,
865,0.97,5592.42,5598.826,It used to be called a Pre- disaster mitigation grant program.,106,,
866,0.97,5598.826,5599.827,It's now called brick.,106,,
867,0.97,5599.827,5604.465,We were able to successfully apply for that.,106,,
868,0.97,5604.465,5605.633,This is a unique thing.,106,,
869,0.97,5605.633,5609.503,We actually applied on behalf of a private entity.,106,,
870,0.97,5609.503,5614.742,"This is in the space, as I know Councilmember Herbold will be happy about.",106,,
871,0.97,5614.742,5620.348,"There is a particular building, it's the Bremer apartments.",106,,
872,0.97,5620.348,5642.87,"Through this grant we were able to get $5 million that is going to enable them to do seismic retrofit, as well as the ability to relocate those occupants during that time, so they can do the promote seismic retrofit work.",106,,
873,0.97,5642.87,5646.14,This is for the office of housing.,106,,
874,0.97,5646.14,5647.875,We're tickled that we got this grant.,106,,
875,0.97,5647.875,5660.087,I think it gives us inside into what hopefully the future will look like for us in tapping these types of grants in the future ..,106,,
876,0.97,5660.087,5664.392,"Additionally, Wees also got a grant to do s DOT work.",106,,
877,0.97,5664.392,5665.893,There is a bridge.,106,,
878,0.97,5665.893,5676.237,It's it's eighth Avenue Northwest bridge that needs to be Seismically structured and Seismically Retrofitted.,106,,
879,0.97,5676.237,5682.143,"Thanks to Erica, for years we have successfully gotten hazard mitigation grants over the years.",106,,
880,0.97,5682.143,5686.714,I think we've gotten over $16 million through the years.,106,,
881,0.97,5686.714,5696.49,"So we've got good record on this, and we're continuing to get these funds.",106,,
882,0.97,5696.49,5723.517,"Given that this grant, as it relates specifically to the Bremer apartments is sort of an inaugural approach to Partnering with a non-profit housing provider, is this something that we can expect to see Replicated in future grant cycles?",107,,
883,0.97,5723.517,5765.926,"And I just want to note that you know, the surveys that the city has done, and the engagement that the city has done with the development community has really focused on Prioritizing certain types of Unreinforced masonry buildings, and has recommended a mandatory seismic upgrade approach that again, focuses on particular characteristics of Unreinforced masonry buildings, and I'm very supportive of what you've done with the Bremer.",107,,
884,0.97,5765.926,5792.653,"But I do want to note, some of the highest priority investments for Urm and under the recommendations that have been made in the past, for how we should implement a mandatory seismic upgrade program is to really focus on buildings that are places of public gatherings.",107,,
885,0.97,5792.653,5823.25,"And I just, you know, again, this is not, and I'm not throwing shade at the work that you've done with the Bremer, fantastic work, but I do want to note that we still don't have this mandatory Urm program in place, means that we really lost an opportunity, I think to take advantage of the fact that a lot of these Seismically vulnerable buildings that were places of gathering were empty this year.",107,,
886,0.97,5823.25,5832.626,"Had we had a program in place focused on Thosebuildings, I think there's a lot of work upgrading those buildings that could have been done in the past year.",107,,
887,0.97,5832.626,5862.189,"Given that we didn't have a program in place, again, I'm really grateful for OEM in being creative, and working with the community to apply for this grant, and interest in knowing how you plan to Replicate that approach with other Nonprofits, and community partners who own Urm properties, moving forward.",107,,
888,0.97,5862.189,5866.86,"One, replicating the effort on these FEMA grants.",107,,
889,0.97,5866.86,5877.204,"But also, what you believe are the next steps for working to develop a mandatory Urm program for the city.",107,,
890,0.97,5877.204,5882.443,I'll just speak on at least the brick piece.,108,,
891,0.97,5882.443,5887.815,"I can't guarantee, Councilmember, that this is going to be a continued practice, but I think we've made headway.",108,,
892,0.97,5887.815,5899.827,"And so the success of us getting granted for the Bremer apartment, the ability for us to do costing relocation I think is a very positive thing.",108,,
893,0.97,5899.827,5911.038,"I can't say, you know, 100%, that that will continue in the future, but I think everybody's going to be watching how this goes, and seeing how it possibly could be Replicated in the future.",108,,
894,0.97,5911.038,5919.78,"I think your questions on next steps, I know you've had conversations with curry, our director on this.",108,,
895,0.97,5919.78,5930.624,"And I think she's got some insights on how she SEES for next steps and looking forward to a conversation with you, on what those next steps are going to look like.",108,,
896,0.97,5930.624,5930.958,Thank you.,109,,
897,0.97,5930.958,5938.799,"All right, I'm going to move through the next items here fairly quickly, because I think we're probably getting pushed to time here.",110,,
898,0.97,5938.799,5945.306,"So just Fyi, a lot of what we do as I mentioned, day-to-day, is in the space of outreach.",110,,
899,0.97,5945.306,5949.41,So we will actively involved in weekly meetings last year.,110,,
900,0.97,5949.41,5956.717,"And as I mentioned, we were Activelily involved with our partners at DOM.",110,,
901,0.97,5956.717,5963.424,We've done a lot of translation of our materials into other languages.,110,,
902,0.97,5963.424,5976.904,"So I encourage you, we do have, if you search on Youtube, Seattle emergency management, you're going to see a number of Youtubes that have been translated into other languages.",110,,
903,0.97,5976.904,5982.743,We continue to build on having a better library.,110,,
904,0.97,5982.743,5984.011,All of those different language Memes.,110,,
905,0.97,5984.011,5993.887,"You you'll see a spot on there, where you get to be introduced to a couple of our cm a's.",110,,
906,0.97,5993.887,6010.27,"They're just fabulous, and they make a connection to our community, and actually speaking in those native languages, that of course, I can't speak, nor am I part of those communities, so we really value all of those individuals.",110,,
907,0.97,6010.27,6022.149,"Also, we continue to ask for people to sign up for alert Seattle, so we're currently at 58,435 sign UPS.",110,,
908,0.97,6022.149,6025.519,"So last year, we made a milestone, where we increase by 14,000.",110,,
909,0.97,6025.519,6029.59,So it's great that we continue to increase people Accessing that system.,110,,
910,0.97,6029.59,6048.308,"The other thing that we have in the office of emergency management, is we tap into volunteers, in that there's so many people that want to do good things for their communities, and we're so appreciative of those individuals who are willing to volunteer with us.",110,,
911,0.97,6048.308,6056.884,"Last year, during a Covid year, we still had lots of people that were willing to give their time to help in the office of emergency management.",110,,
912,0.97,6056.884,6064.224,We're also doing a lot of work in the space of working with youth.,110,,
913,0.97,6064.224,6068.328,So we've got a pretty great youth program that we're starting to develop.,110,,
914,0.97,6068.328,6073.167,There were four to five schools that we're continuing to expand that program.,110,,
915,0.97,6073.167,6088.082,"These individuals also are helping us to promote alert Seattle, and get the information out to the community on how they can sign up for alert Seattle.",110,,
916,0.97,6088.082,6092.319,I'd mentioned this group previously.,110,,
917,0.97,6092.319,6092.92,Our auxiliary surfaces team.,110,,
918,0.97,6092.92,6093.387,Same thing.,110,,
919,0.97,6093.387,6098.725,"There's 145Ish, or so of them, that continue to help us through the year.",110,,
920,0.97,6098.725,6103.43,They do also Pivoted their operations to be able to provide support last year during Covid.,110,,
921,0.97,6103.43,6106.2,They continue to do so this year.,110,,
922,0.97,6106.2,6127.955,"When the big earthquake does happen, they really are going to be our ears for us, but we may not have normal radio systems, normal communication telephone Systemment we really are going to be reliant to make those communication linkages for us.",110,,
923,0.97,6127.955,6133.127,"Lastly, I'll just share a couple more slides here.",110,,
924,0.97,6133.127,6134.895,The stop the bleed program.,110,,
925,0.97,6134.895,6137.197,So tickled about stop the bleed program.,110,,
926,0.97,6137.197,6147.608,"Through the years, we've been able to get grant funding that has allowed us to install stop the bleed kits at different locations.",110,,
927,0.97,6147.608,6155.315,"So we have spent almost $21,000 from a grant to be able to provide lick access stop the bleed kits.",110,,
928,0.97,6155.315,6165.926,We're looking to expand that with additional grant funds we have kits at the community centers.,110,,
929,0.97,6165.926,6167.961,We also have kit as the Seattle center.,110,,
930,0.97,6167.961,6178.705,"We're hoping to expand those out to the public library system, as well as work with the public school system and community based organizations.",110,,
931,0.97,6178.705,6182.843,We currently have 14 volunteers that help us to do this training.,110,,
932,0.97,6182.843,6210.504,"They are individuals that are either Emt's, or they're nurses, but we partner with the Harborview medical center with their physicians and volunteers who actually deliver and make sure that we can continue to keep the public on how they can do Affective stop effective stop the bleed.",110,,
933,0.97,6210.504,6214.241,We now have 17 here in 2021.,110,,
934,0.97,6214.241,6215.375,They speak 13 different languages.,110,,
935,0.97,6215.375,6230.724,"We use them, and will continue to use them, not only to provide the preparedness message, but we're also using them to help us communicate out to the public on how we respond as a community, and how we respond as a government.",110,,
936,0.97,6230.724,6234.494,We've got a Plethora of plans that you've heard Barb talk about in the past.,110,,
937,0.97,6234.494,6248.475,"We need to get account community input into that, and we need to make sure that the community can support us, when we do face the large emergencies that we need to respond to.",110,,
938,0.97,6248.475,6261.822,"Then we also are, besides the community Ambassador, the city is creating entities with the CBO's out there.",110,,
939,0.97,6261.822,6268.261,We're ensuring that we've got outreach to the refugee population.,110,,
940,0.97,6268.261,6277.504,"We've given them $5,000 last year to help do that preparedness education.",110,,
941,0.97,6277.504,6289.95,"We also have the Villa Comunitaria, that we've also given $5,000 to, that reaches out to the Latinx community.",110,,
942,0.97,6289.95,6299.326,We're hoping to expand into the Pacific Islander population as well for this year.,110,,
943,0.97,6299.326,6300.193,I think that that's it.,110,,
944,0.97,6300.193,6303.797,I think that's it for the office of emergency management.,110,,
945,0.97,6303.797,6308.301,I appreciate the time to be able to do the brief to all of you.,110,,
946,0.97,6308.301,6318.278,"There's lots going on, and I appreciate again, all the support that the Council has done for the office of emergency management.",110,,

949,0.97,6324.685,6342.235,"I appreciate the challenges of the previous year that you faced, and the fact that, you know, you and your staff were on the ground in the face of many of these challenges and the difficulties I know that presented, again, to you and your staff.",111,,
950,0.97,6342.235,6348.141,"I appreciate having the opportunity to lift up your important work here, with us today.",111,,

952,0.97,6354.648,6357.718,I think that's coming up next.,111,,
953,0.97,6357.718,6360.487,So thanks again.,111,,
954,0.97,6360.487,6361.955,Thank you.,112,,
955,0.97,6361.955,6362.589,Bye now.,113,,
956,0.97,6362.589,6373.967,"All right, Alex, can you read into the agenda, the next item please?",113,,
957,0.97,6373.967,6388.315,"Agenda Item2, and ordinance Amendmenting 12637, which adopted the 2020 budget, changing appropriations to various departments and budget control levels and from various funds in the budget and adding or modifying.",114,,
958,0.97,6388.315,6388.582,Yes.,115,,
959,0.97,6388.582,6399.292,So I'm going to quickly hand this over to Greg to give us sort of an update on what is in the proposed substitute bill.,115,,
960,0.97,6399.292,6404.798,But I want to just make some quick Introductionry remarks myself first.,115,,
961,0.97,6404.798,6410.47,This is the third meeting that the public safety and human services committee has had on this particular bill.,115,,
962,0.97,6410.47,6417.277,We did have two previous meetings scheduled prior to the three meetings that we have had.,115,,
963,0.97,6417.277,6419.713,It was originally scheduled for the meeting of the 26th.,115,,
964,0.97,6419.713,6423.717,It was not heard due to time constraints.,115,,
965,0.97,6423.717,6444.204,"We scheduled it for presentation on February 9., but we held the discussion of the bill, we held even discussion of the bill based on the request of the city attorney's office, after comments in early February from judge Robard.",115,,
966,0.97,6444.204,6448.308,So no discussion on the 26th.,115,,
967,0.97,6448.308,6451.344,Though scheduled on February 9th.,115,,
968,0.97,6451.344,6455.816,We did begin discussion on February 23rd.,115,,
969,0.97,6455.816,6466.593,"On February 23rd, we had a high level overview of the bill itself and what had brought us to proposing the bill.",115,,
970,0.97,6466.593,6494.855,"And I at that point indicated some of my interests in making amendments to the bill consistent with things that I had said at the time of proposing the bill, which was although I did see this as a way to hold SPD accountable for its overtime spending, that I was not going to be Ridged, and when it came time to hear the bill itself, that I would consider needs for SPD spending.",115,,
971,0.97,6494.855,6501.628,"In the second meeting that we had, I invited SPD to present on its recommendations.",115,,
972,0.97,6501.628,6507.501,These are recommendations that it had made in preparation for the January 26th meeting.,115,,
973,0.97,6507.501,6512.572,So these recommendations had been publicly available since January 26th.,115,,
974,0.97,6512.572,6527.52,"And the police Department did come and present on March 9th to do the overview on their recommendations for funding, additional funding for 2021 spending.",115,,
975,0.97,6527.52,6536.029,"It's important to note, that the bill before us now is not about funding for police officer staffing.",115,,
976,0.97,6536.029,6545.906,"And that is because the 2021 SPD staffing and hiring plan is, and always has been fully funded since November.",115,,
977,0.97,6545.906,6569.362,"Again, the 2021 hiring plan, so these are the funds that are available to SPD to hire new officers for 2021 has been fully funded, since November, based on the assumptions on the maximum number of people that SPD can hire.",115,,
978,0.97,6569.362,6612.238,"We did not vote for a 2021 hiring freeze as was discussed at the end of 2020 during the budget process, and I think from the perspective of some, I can say, for myself, I do not support a hiring freeze, because I was clear, as well as throughout the 2021 discussion that I was comfortable with making reductions in SPD's budget that would realize no more than 100 reductions in police officers.",115,,
979,0.97,6612.238,6620.68,Now none of our budget cuts actually resulted in layoffs of police officers.,115,,
980,0.97,6620.68,6628.288,But Nevertheless 186 officers left the police Department in 2020.,115,,
981,0.97,6628.288,6643.47,The Council we heard today in public comment the call for folks on the Council to Reallocate funds from SPD to scale up alternatives.,115,,
982,0.97,6643.47,6645.171,The Council has done that.,115,,
983,0.97,6645.171,6648.208,I believe we will continue to do that.,115,,
984,0.97,6648.208,6651.311,We did so in the 2021 budget.,115,,
985,0.97,6651.311,6667.093,And the substitute bill that we're about to discuss continues that commitment of reducing the SPD budget and using those funds to fund community alternatives.,115,,
986,0.97,6667.093,6671.197,"Last week, the Council approved $10.4 million for community alternatives.",115,,
987,0.97,6671.197,6679.939,The human services Department last year moved quickly to award $4 million in funds to the community safety initiative.,115,,
988,0.97,6679.939,6690.383,"Again these are funds that were provided by the Council to support community investment, so that we can move away on reliance on policing.",115,,
989,0.97,6690.383,6703.93,"Finally, of course, the Council also in last year's budget allocated $30 million for Participatory budgeting to be spent in 2021.",115,,
990,0.97,6703.93,6717.077,"The work in the inner departmental Tas, force with the Mayor's Department of the task force prompted by the Mayor's executive order on Reimagining policing and community safety.",115,,
991,0.97,6717.077,6730.29,"So that work continues as well, and I've been working to try to get some updates from the executive in this committee to hear more about that work.",115,,
992,0.97,6730.29,6745.872,"As I've mentioned on numerous occasions, everything that we do as it relates to public safety has to be put within the context of a consent decree with the U.S. Department of justice.",115,,
993,0.97,6745.872,6755.081,"Judge Robard has stated concern about significant cuts to the police Department budget, and emphasized the importance of Scaling up policing alternatives.",115,,
994,0.97,6755.081,6762.188,"The Federal monitor, who was appointed by the judge has expressed interest in this ordinance.",115,,
995,0.97,6762.188,6772.165,"As I mentioned earlier, we delayed a discussion on this ordinance in February because of concerns that we had heard from the judge.",115,,
996,0.97,6772.165,6773.466,We took some time.,115,,
997,0.97,6773.466,6813.54,"The Council and executive worked with the city attorney's office to send a memo to the monitor that explains the cuts that were made in the 2021 budget, and the nature of the bill before us so we kind of hit pause in order to have that time to explain to the monitor the impacts of the reductions that the Council had made in the past.",115,,
998,0.97,6813.54,6817.744,And the monitor continues to express interest in this ordinance.,115,,
999,0.97,6817.744,6827.487,"Yesterday the police Department received a letter from the monitor that Council was copied on, and I'm going to quote from this letter again, like I did yesterday morning.",115,,
1000,0.97,6827.487,6840.2,"It says the monitoring team asks that these questions be answered as expeditiously as possible, and prior to further actions by the city on the budget of the Seattle police Department.",115,,
1001,0.97,6840.2,6847.273,"Upon receipt of the analysis, the monitoring team will confer with the Department of justice and advise the court.",115,,
1002,0.97,6847.273,6859.686,I want to again recognize that these are questions that the monitoring team is asking of the Seattle police Department.,115,,
1003,0.97,6859.686,6888.681,"And you know, just so the intent is that the Seattle police Department answer the questions that the monitoring team is asking, and then the monitoring team consider the answers to these questions before the Council, and we would likely hear from the monitoring team and the judge, based on their consideration of the police Department's answers to the questions.",115,,
1004,0.97,6888.681,6894.821,And we'd likely hear from them before the Council takes final action.,115,,
1005,0.97,6894.821,6915.074,"So if there were to be any committee action today, it's likely that, well it's not likely, we would have to delay full council action until the monitor and the Department of justice have received the responses to the questions from the SPD and advise the court.",115,,
1006,0.97,6915.074,6922.715,"So again, this is somewhat similar to the Council's consideration of legislation.",115,,
1007,0.97,6922.715,6931.624,And to be clear it can end up being a elimination on the Council's authority as listed in the charter.,115,,
1008,0.97,6931.624,6958.785,"It's true that the legislation originated with the Council statement in resolution 31926, which stated that the Council will not support any budget amendments to increase the Seattle police Department's budget above the funds budgeted in 2020 or 2021, the additional $5.4 million did not align with this resolution.",115,,
1009,0.97,6958.785,6959.218,We recognize that.,115,,
1010,0.97,6959.218,6973.366,"And because it did not align with this resolution, we propose this budget bill that's before us now to reduce the police Department's budget by $5.4 million.",115,,
1011,0.97,6973.366,6988.214,"Again, as proposed, the reduction would come from funds approved for salaries that are not expected to be spent.",115,,
1012,0.97,6988.214,6999.993,"So again, the origins of the reduction are from salary savings because of officers who have left the Department.",115,,
1013,0.97,6999.993,7017.377,"So we had budgeted for those officers to be in the Department, they've left the Department, and there are more officers who have left the Department than the Department can hire from.",115,,
1014,0.97,7017.377,7025.752,The Council previously placed a proviso on funds from 2020.,115,,
1015,0.97,7025.752,7036.362,"That were not included in the Mayor's 2020 budget, so the Mayor did not propose these items in her budget.",115,,
1016,0.97,7036.362,7042.235,"In addition, Judge Robart has made his comments at the status conference.",115,,
1017,0.97,7042.235,7081.741,"I want to note, since it's an issue of concern, that Council has authorized funding several times for public safety in the Chinatown International district after the 2016 Chinatown International district public safety report that I understand that the chief of police is working to fund some of those positions, or at least one of those positions that have been authorized independent of our action today, I know that community members have interest in seeing that that position gets funded.",115,,
1018,0.97,7081.741,7093.886,"I think there are still some questions about whether or not that position is funded through SPD or another Department, but I understand that those conversations Areongoing.",115,,
1019,0.97,7093.886,7105.131,"High level before I hand it over to Greg, depending on where you sit, this bill has something that everybody has been asking for.",115,,
1020,0.97,7105.131,7112.772,It includes a cut to SPD to hold them accountable for overtime spending.,115,,
1021,0.97,7112.772,7126.219,"It includes a cut of $3 million, approximately, and sends two of these approximately $3 million to be spent on Participatory budgeting.",115,,
1022,0.97,7126.219,7144.403,"It also, where the place where you sit is to recognize that in light of reductions in police Department staffing of officers, that there are things that the police Department can do to mitigate the impacts of the loss of officers.",115,,
1023,0.97,7144.403,7161.02,"And if you're interested in funding some of the civilian community positions that were frozen in the Mayor's proposed 2021 budget that the Council approved, there are about $4 million worth of civilian positions frozen.",115,,
1024,0.97,7161.02,7166.692,That this bill has something in it for you as well.,115,,
1025,0.97,7166.692,7175.134,"Other items that I have identified as priorities, because I've heard from the city auditor.",115,,
1026,0.97,7175.134,7180.006,I've heard from members of the press about concerns of public disclosure.,115,,
1027,0.97,7180.006,7183.709,I have investments in this bill relate today that.,115,,
1028,0.97,7183.709,7192.151,And then also investments in the bill related to recommendation coming out of the office of the inspector general.,115,,
1029,0.97,7192.151,7200.726,"With that, let's hand it over to Greg Doss to run us through the more detailed overview that I know he's prepared for us.",115,,
1030,0.97,7200.726,7202.028,"Thank you, Madam chair.",116,,
1031,0.97,7202.028,7207.466,Good morning members of the public safety committee.,116,,
1032,0.97,7207.466,7208.801,Very thorough introduction by the chair.,116,,
1033,0.97,7208.801,7212.104,And that leaves me with not as much to do.,116,,
1034,0.97,7212.104,7218.644,What I'm going to do today is to walk you through the proposed amendment.,116,,
1035,0.97,7218.644,7222.315,Amendment number 1. it is a very complicated amendment.,116,,
1036,0.97,7222.315,7230.022,So I have a power point presentation that I would share.,116,,
1037,0.97,7230.022,7236.329,And would like to know if folks can confirm that they can see it?,116,,
1038,0.97,7236.329,7237.029,We can see it.,117,,
1039,0.97,7237.029,7237.597,Excellent.,118,,
1040,0.97,7237.597,7242.001,So I'm going to go ahead and walk you through the amendment.,118,,
1041,0.97,7242.001,7250.876,I'm going to start with a table that has all the elements of the spending that are requested in the amendment.,118,,
1042,0.97,7250.876,7271.864,"And just to Orient you to this table, what you're seeing here is at the very top line, projected salary savings, as we have talked about in the past, council central staff analysis found that the unplanned separations in 2020 could result in as much as $7.7 million in salary savings in 2021.",118,,
1043,0.97,7271.864,7286.712,"Again, those are for officers that have already left the Department and the total of their salaries funded in the adopted budget, but that will not be needed will be $7.7 million as estimated.",118,,
1044,0.97,7286.712,7293.052,"Then, the bill proceeds to direct spending for the $7.7 million.",118,,
1045,0.97,7293.052,7297.59,It does so in two ways.,118,,
1046,0.97,7297.59,7303.562,The first way is to redirect $4.85 million of that salary savings for SPD's use.,118,,
1047,0.97,7303.562,7318.678,"When I say redirect, what I mean is there is legislative intent that is spelled out in the legislation although it is not, there is no proviso that says the Department has to do these things.",118,,
1048,0.97,7318.678,7324.283,Rather it leaves flexibility to the Department to do whatever it's top priorities are.,118,,
1049,0.97,7324.283,7341.0,Just recognizing that the first four lines on this spreadsheet are the Department's top priorities as they have articulated them in a memo both to the monitor and to the Council in January.,118,,
1050,0.97,7341.0,7347.34,"So as you can see, the first four items, the SPD redirected 4.85.",118,,
1051,0.97,7347.34,7352.178,"Then the second four items, that is Councilmember Herbold talked a little bit about those investments.",118,,
1052,0.97,7352.178,7354.447,I'm going to go into them in more detail.,118,,
1053,0.97,7354.447,7363.422,That money is moved into other departments for the functions that she spoke about.,118,,
1054,0.97,7363.422,7369.028,Go ahead and jump into it.,118,,
1055,0.97,7369.028,7383.676,"I'm sorry, SPD has expressed interest in a using salaries to mitigate the loss of officers to respond for more transparency, and accountability, and to allow the agency to continue its compliance with the consent decree.",118,,
1056,0.97,7383.676,7389.315,Some of their requested expenditures include the $1.8 million for separation pay.,118,,
1057,0.97,7389.315,7392.885,"That is for 2021, the top line.",118,,
1058,0.97,7392.885,7395.755,"The second line, $2.18 million for technology investments.",118,,
1059,0.97,7395.755,7397.123,And there's three things there.,118,,
1060,0.97,7397.123,7404.296,"The first is maintenance, and expansion of the data ANALYTICS platform.",118,,
1061,0.97,7404.296,7416.242,The second is purchase of the capacity that will allow SPD to evaluate demand for 911 response and to calculate staffing requirements for alternative 911 response scenarios.,118,,
1062,0.97,7416.242,7429.822,"Lastly, there is funding to purchase an early intervention system, that would guide intervention for employees that are exhibiting signs that they need support.",118,,
1063,0.97,7429.822,7437.096,Spd has said the technology investments would support its ability to comply with the consent decree.,118,,
1064,0.97,7437.096,7440.499,Spd has also asked for some civilian funding.,118,,
1065,0.97,7440.499,7441.834,They asked for a total of $1.4 million.,118,,
1066,0.97,7441.834,7451.177,"As you can see here in the table, the civilian funding line, line number 3, provides $795,000.",118,,
1067,0.97,7451.177,7458.317,That's about half a year's worth of funding for civilian positions.,118,,
1068,0.97,7458.317,7469.495,Recognizing that it takes some time to get them Onboard through recruitment and backing.,118,,
1069,0.97,7469.495,7474.867,Half a year funding there.,118,,
1070,0.97,7474.867,7475.768,Four community service officers.,118,,
1071,0.97,7475.768,7483.776,"One community service supervisor, one manage they're would work with the data management group.",118,,
1072,0.97,7483.776,7493.452,One management systems analyst that would work on the budget section.,118,,
1073,0.97,7493.452,7497.857,And a couple an Admin staff analysts for public disclosure.,118,,
1074,0.97,7497.857,7506.398,"Moving onto the fifth line, there's a position for another public disclosure.",118,,
1075,0.97,7506.398,7520.112,This position would be dedicated to fulfilling public requests related to the accountability.,118,,
1076,0.97,7520.112,7532.591,"There is already one that works for the office of police accountability, that position and this new one would be requested to be dedicated for OPA support.",118,,
1077,0.97,7532.591,7546.572,"That is because as the chair said, the city auditor found there were staffing issues in the public disclosure unit, and that this would allow for more timely response.",118,,
1078,0.97,7546.572,7557.716,"Then Lastly, on the public, on the subject of public disclosure, there's dish of information technology specialist, that's funded in the Seattle information technology Department.",118,,
1079,0.97,7557.716,7564.69,But would work with SPD public disclosure to help facilitate Email search functions.,118,,
1080,0.97,7564.69,7567.026,That's a function that is done by Seattle I.T.,118,,
1081,0.97,7567.026,7581.84,"Throughout the city, with the exception of SPD, and they don't currently do SPD because of various criminal justice requirements around systems.",118,,
1082,0.97,7581.84,7585.377,This particular position that's funded in Seattle I.T.,118,,
1083,0.97,7585.377,7599.992,"Would need to be given clearance to do this, and the departments would have to work out how that would happen, but the bottom line is that it would provide additional capacity for that function.",118,,
1084,0.97,7599.992,7611.003,"And here again, it's the $100,000, it represents a half year of expenditure on that position, and I should mention the same thing with the position of a half year of expenditure.",118,,
1085,0.97,7611.003,7615.975,"Greg, can you pause for a second?",119,,
1086,0.97,7615.975,7616.275,Thank you.,119,,
1087,0.97,7616.275,7623.849,I see Councilmember Morales has her hand raised ..,119,,
1088,0.97,7623.849,7624.016,No?,119,,
1089,0.97,7624.016,7626.919,"I do, thank you.",120,,
1090,0.97,7626.919,7627.686,"Sorry, my screen's open.",120,,
1091,0.97,7627.686,7629.888,If we could stay on slide one for a moment.,120,,
1092,0.97,7629.888,7635.995,I just want to make sure I'm understanding this.,120,,
1093,0.97,7635.995,7641.467,So there's $4.85 million in priorities.,120,,
1094,0.97,7641.467,7647.84,"We pull out the separation pay, which I can understand perhaps was unanticipated, the scale of it anyway.",120,,
1095,0.97,7647.84,7653.479,There's $3 million left for things that presumably have privates before.,120,,
1096,0.97,7653.479,7656.015,The technology Pdr has been an issue.,120,,
1097,0.97,7656.015,7659.318,I think that was identified in 2015.,120,,
1098,0.97,7659.318,7669.695,So it's not like these are new issues that the Department has just become aware of.,120,,
1099,0.97,7669.695,7689.982,"So I think what I would say is that when the Department has talked about this, they have recognized that they, through normal course of managing their budget have salary savings that at some level that they're able to dedicate to these kinds of issues.",121,,
1100,0.97,7689.982,7704.396,The challenge they're having this year is that there is an expressed desire by the Council through at least one proviso to hold salary savings for potential redistribution for par ties Pa tore budgeting.,121,,
1101,0.97,7704.396,7710.335,So the Department doesn't necessarily know that it can count on its salary savings to purchase these things.,121,,
1102,0.97,7710.335,7725.751,"So when they're putting together the budget and their plan for 2021, they may have thought they could cover some of these salary savings, and now they're saying that they don't have that flexibility.",121,,
1103,0.97,7725.751,7735.728,"Additionally, they've said that some of these things are merging that would come up that would probably be more relevant for the I team.",121,,
1104,0.97,7735.728,7753.112,"As it relates specifically to the public disclosure issue and the evidence storage issue, these are items that I've identified as my priorities, because there are recommendations that date back to 2015 and 2016 from the city auditor.",122,,
1105,0.97,7753.112,7788.18,"I recognize that the police Department has taken some actions, as it relates to public disclosure requests, but the revelations that, of the amount of time it takes for public disclosure responses, the concern of state officials who have Oversite on public disclosure has made this a higher priority investment area for me and so that's, as it relates to public disclosure, as it receipts to evidence storage.",122,,
1106,0.97,7788.18,7796.255,This is coming out of a relatively new set of recommendations from the office of the inspector general.,122,,
1107,0.97,7796.255,7799.358,These dollars do not go to SPD.,122,,
1108,0.97,7799.358,7800.359,They would go to FAS.,122,,
1109,0.97,7800.359,7825.217,"And they are to address a problem that is resulting, or has in the past resulted in the destruction of evidence by the police Department and you know, the very clear need for another location for evidence to be stored.",122,,
1110,0.97,7825.217,7834.359,"Some of the, again, some of the public disclosure funds are not going directly to SPD.",122,,
1111,0.97,7834.359,7845.737,"Some of them are going to Seattle I.T., again in recognition that the Seattle police Department is one of the only departments in the city that does not have Seattle I.T.",122,,
1112,0.97,7845.737,7848.974,Doing their Email searching for Compliant records.,122,,
1113,0.97,7848.974,7863.121,"Some of the funds are going, though, you know, OPA is still within SPD, it is being budgeted condition OPA for the OPA functions.",122,,
1114,0.97,7863.121,7885.877,"Yeah, I guess, the point I guess I'm really trying to make here is that the Department can choose to Prioritize its budget however it wants, whenever before wants.",123,,
1115,0.97,7885.877,7890.582,"Last year, it focused on overtime pay.",123,,
1116,0.97,7890.582,7891.216,Fully agree.,124,,
1117,0.97,7891.216,7892.05,From my perspective.,124,,
1118,0.97,7892.05,7923.115,"That's why the decision of the Council to propose this legislation last year, this cut creates, I think a dialogue with the police Department that maybe we didn't have before about rather than just living up in the air their salary savings, they can use if for things that are their priorities.",124,,
1119,0.97,7923.115,7944.703,"My hope is we can still take a strong position against overtime spending that exceeds their budget, while also having a shared conversation about our shared objectives using this budget bill as a tool to do so.",124,,
1120,0.97,7944.703,7955.047,"So I don't have too much more to add, Councilmember Herbold is again, quite thorough in her explanations.",125,,
1121,0.97,7955.047,7957.749,I would cover the last line.,125,,
1122,0.97,7957.749,7982.841,"$225,000 that is added for Hsd to add five additional crisis responders to the SPD crisis response team that that particular contract for the mental health professionals that are on the crisis response team is funded through Hsd, and the 225,000 again represents a half year of funding for five additional mental health professionals.",125,,
1123,0.97,7982.841,7994.386,"So if there's not any questions on this slide, I'll go onto the next.",125,,
1124,0.97,7994.386,7998.357,"Okay so, there is a proviso change in this legislation.",125,,
1125,0.97,7998.357,8016.208,"It take as proviso that was added to the 2021 budget, and that was Spd011B002, and it modifies it.",125,,
1126,0.97,8016.208,8038.93,"The original proviso withheld $5 million and expressed an intent to salary savings, so that if more salary savings became available due to additional separations or to fewer hires, then that salary savings might be redirected to Participatory budgeting.",125,,
1127,0.97,8038.93,8064.222,"What this does is it would modify that proviso, so that it no longer holds the $5 million in Perpetuity, but requires SPD to submit staffing reports each month, and for each staffing report that they submit, a portion of the proviso will be released.",125,,
1128,0.97,8064.222,8069.828,"The way it works out, is there would be eight months that occur between now and the end of the year.",125,,
1129,0.97,8069.828,8074.699,"The $5 million divided by 8 comes to $625,000.",125,,
1130,0.97,8074.699,8086.278,"So basically, every time the Department submit as report, it will receive 625,000 of authority released from this proviso.",125,,
1131,0.97,8086.278,8106.431,"The point of this proviso is to require staffing reports including projects for both hiring and separation, so that the Council can continue to monitor salary Savings and can continue, if it wishes to involve itself in the spending of those savings or not.",125,,
1132,0.97,8106.431,8126.785,"But at least gives the Department, or the counsel, the ability to monitor it, whereas the statement of legislation, statement of intend on the 2021 budget legislation didn't require these reports, it just requested them.",125,,
1133,0.97,8126.785,8135.427,"This particular proviso would require them, and release some of the proviso.",125,,
1134,0.97,8135.427,8157.048,"It intends that in amending this proviso, that SPD staff would have access to future salary savings to fund the SPD staffing plan.",125,,
1135,0.97,8157.048,8159.751,"I'm sorry, I have my participant screen up.",126,,
1136,0.97,8159.751,8162.087,I did not see you there.,126,,
1137,0.97,8162.087,8166.324,I can't figure out how to raise my hand.,127,,
1138,0.97,8166.324,8166.625,I'm sorry.,127,,
1139,0.97,8166.625,8172.063,The function is like disappeared from my screen.,127,,
1140,0.97,8172.063,8175.901,"So I'm going old school here, my apologies.",127,,
1141,0.97,8175.901,8188.079,"Greg, on this particular, this was a budget action that I sponsored in last year.",127,,
1142,0.97,8188.079,8193.919,And I'm still becoming familiar with the impact of this proposed proviso.,127,,
1143,0.97,8193.919,8226.218,"So if I understand what you're saying correctly, this substitute bill would amend the proviso that the city council adopted in 2020, to begin slowly releasing the savings of the $5 million, the salary savings under, in the $5 million proviso back to SPD.",127,,
1144,0.97,8226.218,8227.185,Yes.,128,,
1145,0.97,8227.185,8231.756,That's the effect of this.,129,,
1146,0.97,8231.756,8232.157,Yeah.,130,,
1147,0.97,8232.157,8233.325,"The additional salary savings, right?",130,,
1148,0.97,8233.325,8242.534,"Because the bill that we have before us was $5.4 million bill, and there was a $5 million proviso in addition to this.",130,,
1149,0.97,8242.534,8246.705,What we're doing now is we're working from a $7.7 million base.,130,,
1150,0.97,8246.705,8257.048,"So we're already scooping some of the salary savings, as contemplated under the $5 million proviso.",130,,
1151,0.97,8257.048,8263.321,So I think it's reasonable to assume that there may be additional salary savings.,130,,
1152,0.97,8263.321,8271.73,This would only go into effect if there were additional salary savings.,130,,
1153,0.97,8271.73,8278.169,"Councilmember Herbold, this would actually be in effect, regardless of whether there were additional salary savings.",131,,
1154,0.97,8278.169,8289.314,It is the case that this would hold up $5 million of authority that would release dependent on reports.,131,,
1155,0.97,8289.314,8292.917,That would happen in respect of whether or not there were salary savings.,131,,
1156,0.97,8292.917,8300.158,You would know there were salary savings because of this proviso and because of the requirement that they send staffing reports.,131,,
1157,0.97,8300.158,8303.895,So I am a little confused here.,132,,
1158,0.97,8303.895,8307.832,It's titled the $5 million salary savings proviso.,132,,
1159,0.97,8307.832,8313.305,That was the original action.,133,,
1160,0.97,8313.305,8317.876,The Spd11B002 is holding on $5 million on salary savings.,133,,
1161,0.97,8317.876,8323.882,"The revised version holds 5 million still, but releases it based on the reporting requirements.",133,,
1162,0.97,8323.882,8337.696,"Got it, so this is a way for us to make sure that the Council is aware if there are additional salary savings, a we move through the year.",134,,
1163,0.97,8337.696,8337.996,Correct.,135,,
1164,0.97,8337.996,8338.329,Thank you.,136,,
1165,0.97,8338.329,8359.751,"But I think I want to get back to the point I was trying to make, which is it does that, but it also releases in increments the salary savings that are part of that $5 million bucket, correct?",137,,
1166,0.97,8359.751,8364.189,Well it's releasing the 5 5Á million dollars proviso.,138,,
1167,0.97,8364.189,8369.394,"Right now, we don't necessarily know there's going to be an additional $5 million in salary savings.",138,,
1168,0.97,8369.394,8374.365,We know there's the $7 million in salary savings that occurred from 2021.,138,,
1169,0.97,8374.365,8391.449,"I can say that if current trends continue, it is likely that there will wind up being $5 million of salary savings in 2021.",138,,
1170,0.97,8391.449,8394.753,But ire respective of that it would just release it slowly.,138,,
1171,0.97,8394.753,8405.163,"So if there was other salary savings in the Department, the Council would need to act to grab it.",138,,
1172,0.97,8405.163,8419.01,"I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't understand what's happening on this one.",139,,
1173,0.97,8419.01,8453.178,"I'm just not grasping what the impact is, and I think maybe I'm struggling with understanding, you know, sort of the crosswalk between the underlying Council budget that we adopted in 2020, and what this new amendment does, and I'm just not fully understanding what the effect of this proposal is on the underlying proviso.",139,,
1174,0.97,8453.178,8464.289,"And that's probably just me, but I'm struggling to understand it, so I will, if there's anything else you can sort of point me to to help Orient me, that would be super helpful.",139,,
1175,0.97,8464.289,8471.062,"And while the discussion continues, I can do a little bit of reading up in the background.",139,,
1176,0.97,8471.062,8473.832,I do have the actual proviso language here at the end.,140,,
1177,0.97,8473.832,8480.972,And I don't know if this is helpful or not.,140,,
1178,0.97,8480.972,8489.714,"But this shows how the proviso is, it had been held until authorized by future ordinance, so $5 million was being held up.",140,,
1179,0.97,8489.714,8493.885,And then that $5 million is no longer held up.,140,,
1180,0.97,8493.885,8505.563,"Instead it is released pursuant to these requirements here that it be released 1 month at a time with the report 625,000 each report.",140,,
1181,0.97,8505.563,8509.767,I don't know that that necessarily helps you.,140,,
1182,0.97,8509.767,8512.837,But that's the actual language.,140,,
1183,0.97,8512.837,8515.139,I see.,141,,
1184,0.97,8515.139,8516.808,This is actually helpful.,141,,
1185,0.97,8516.808,8547.972,"So what we're doing, I think what I'm struggling with, is how we dealt with these kind of Provisos, historically in the past, because I think that the original intent was Reallying to able to capture the savings for Council priorities that may be outside of the area, that might be outside of SPD's budget.",141,,
1186,0.97,8547.972,8560.118,"I think what I'm struggling with is just a shift in how we are executing at this point, and I understand, it's a policy choice, and that's why we're having this conversation.",141,,
1187,0.97,8560.118,8564.522,"This is helpful, and I appreciate the additional clarification.",141,,
1188,0.97,8564.522,8567.025,"Yeah, I think one last thing I'd say on this.",142,,
1189,0.97,8567.025,8582.34,"It would be cleaner, probably if the legislation eliminated your original proviso, and put into place a new proviso that does what this does, because as you point out, this is different.",142,,
1190,0.97,8582.34,8590.915,Can I Rephrase the way that makes sense to me?,143,,
1191,0.97,8590.915,8591.683,"Member Morales, yes.",144,,
1192,0.97,8591.683,8614.839,I think my understanding is the original intent of that proviso from last year was to Affectively begin to limit budget authorities so that we could address our longer term goal of Slowlily reducing the budget of SPD and doing something else with those public dollars.,145,,
1193,0.97,8614.839,8619.577,This amendment Erases that goal.,145,,
1194,0.97,8619.577,8620.445,That's how I'm seeing this.,145,,
1195,0.97,8620.445,8631.089,"And it basically just gives the funding back, assuming it's a report.",145,,
1196,0.97,8631.089,8635.994,"If that's a misinterpretation, somebody please help me understand that.",145,,
1197,0.97,8635.994,8660.685,"I think that the context is a little different as far as I can tell from the conversation in the sense that when we passed the $5 million proviso originally, it was in the contention of not having the $5.4 million additional proposed bill.",146,,
1198,0.97,8660.685,8684.475,"And so now, now there's a question about what to do with the $5 million proviso, which as I understand, was always to protect potential salary savings for other Council priorities that are outside of the Seattle police Department.",146,,
1199,0.97,8684.475,8730.154,"But now we're having a conversation where we consider this original $5.4 million budget bill, and added to that is $5 million which again, is a layering that I'm not sure existed when we actually debated, considered, and voted on the original $5 million proviso, but I understand now we are faced with the policy question of whether we wanted $5 million proviso to be additive to the $5.4 million, or if we are effectively swapping those out for a net neutral effect.",146,,
1200,0.97,8730.154,8732.824,That's what I'm tracking.,147,,
1201,0.97,8732.824,8743.034,"I think it's, I think I'm remembering a sentence in the letter to the monitor that explains some of these things.",148,,
1202,0.97,8743.034,8764.856,"I think the thing that a sentence that Resonated with me, as it relates to the relationship between the $5.4 million bill, and the Council President Gonzalez's proviso, is that they had the same source of funds, right?",148,,
1203,0.97,8764.856,8765.289,The salary savings.,148,,
1204,0.97,8765.289,8791.382,"And we didn't, and I think that is what we're grappling with right now is this question of the use of salary savings now versus the controls that we want to put on the police Department's budget as it relates to other priorities that we have in the future.",148,,
1205,0.97,8791.382,8796.988,"Councilmember is a Sawant, I see your hand up.",148,,
1206,0.97,8796.988,8807.265,"I think a lot of the explanation here is, in my view, unnecessarily complicated.",149,,
1207,0.97,8807.265,8817.074,And I feel that essentially what Councilmember Morales just said is what makes sense to me.,149,,
1208,0.97,8817.074,8836.861,"I see this essentially as the, as this proviso change essentially giving police the access to the $5 million without Council action, in the Additioal proviso it said that it would require a Council bill to release the $5 million to the police.",149,,
1209,0.97,8836.861,8874.265,"This bill would remove the requirement for a Council bill and I have no doubt that at that time, I had publicly warned that to reduce the police budget would not come to fruition and the 5 million is an example of that, but I think what is happening now is that this amended version, that the police Department do not even need a future bill to get access to the $5 million, that they just need to provide some reports.",149,,
1210,0.97,8874.265,8877.969,That's what I see is happening.,149,,
1211,0.97,8877.969,8879.37,Thank you.,149,,
1212,0.97,8879.37,8887.645,"Councilmember, just to add clarity, this does reduce by $3 million, the police Department budget.",150,,
1213,0.97,8887.645,8892.183,Your and Councilmember Morales's assessment of salary savings going forward is accurate.,150,,
1214,0.97,8892.183,8898.456,There would not need to be another Council bill to release that funding.,150,,
1215,0.97,8898.456,8911.702,"And I moved onto this slide, because there is intent language in this legislation that speaks to future salary savings.",150,,
1216,0.97,8911.702,8924.448,The intent of the Council is to provide flexibility to SPD to mitigate recent officer departures and to Prioritize obligations under the Federal consent decree.,150,,
1217,0.97,8924.448,8941.866,"This would allow the Department to be able to plan to use future salary savings beyond the 7.7 million that the Council is redirecting today, to their priorities.",150,,
1218,0.97,8941.866,8991.816,"Everything from patrol Augmentation to special events, there's also if there's additional salary savings they should try to maximize them by ensuring there is a mix of staffing that makes the most of any additional new salary savings, but ultimately, yes, you are correct in your assessment, the idea going forward is there would no longer be a lock on salary savings requiring a future appropriation.",150,,
1219,0.97,8991.816,8995.453,Those salary savings would be released over time.,150,,
1220,0.97,8995.453,9025.483,"Greg, is it accurate to say that based on the reporting that this proviso requires, if we find that conditions have changed, based on that reporting, whether or not it relates to future salary savings or some other topic that the reporting requires, that we could, the Council through this committee could take action?",151,,
1221,0.97,9025.483,9043.901,"So for instance, if we find out that there's future salary Savings and we have concerns that they are not going to use those future salary savings to fund shared Council SPD priorities, we could take some action then?",151,,
1222,0.97,9043.901,9049.907,"The Council has the power of the purse, and absolutely, in a supplemental budget they could do that.",152,,
1223,0.97,9049.907,9054.912,And it's my understanding that that was your intent with this.,152,,
1224,0.97,9054.912,9055.413,Thank you.,153,,
1225,0.97,9055.413,9067.458,So the only other thing that I had to say about this is there is language around intent for the current salary savings.,154,,
1226,0.97,9067.458,9067.892,The 7.7 million.,154,,
1227,0.97,9067.892,9072.43,We have already covered all these items so I'm not going to go back into it.,154,,
1228,0.97,9072.43,9085.609,"What this is asking is that SPD use its salary savings to address its on requests that they have noted both in memos to the monitor, and memos to this Committee.",154,,
1229,0.97,9085.609,9100.591,"Request that, and priorities that Councilmember Herbold has noted, and as we discussed, future salary savings would become available for them to address emerging issues, consent decree issues, and mitigation for officer losses.",154,,
1230,0.97,9100.591,9111.502,"So with that, I would ask if there are any questions.",154,,
1231,0.97,9111.502,9111.769,Okay.,155,,
1232,0.97,9111.769,9133.023,"So originally, I had hoped that we could discuss moving the substitute, and potentially make a committee recommendation, again with the understanding that we would not move any committee recommendation to full council until after SPD answers the monitor's questions.",155,,
1233,0.97,9133.023,9160.651,"The monitor considers those answers to SPD's questions, and allows, provides feedback to the court and allows the court to comment on the police Department's answers to the monitor's questions as well as the new bill that we are considering now.",155,,
1234,0.97,9160.651,9185.709,"And I should say I have also shared with the monitor that a copy of this bill, of this proposed substitute, I should say, and have expressed to the monitor my intentions to not take final action in Council on the bill.",155,,
1235,0.97,9185.709,9253.11,"There have been some concerns expressed to me that even making a committee recommendation might create some confusion with the monitor, and might create some concern from the judge and that may be a different approach where we could move the conversation forward without sending a signal to the court and to the monitor that we are not Pausing to consider the Seattle police Department's responses to the monitor's questions, and that perhaps a way to move the conversation forward in a small way today is to move the substitute, but not to actually take action on the substitute day.",155,,
1236,0.97,9253.11,9294.652,"So I just want to get a sense and this is less about, like what your position is on the substitute, it's more a question of whether or not that seems like a reasonable next action to take to have a vote on substituting the original bill for the existing bill regardless of what your position is on the substitute, whether or not that seems Procedurally a reasonable next step to take.",155,,
1237,0.97,9294.652,9296.654,Opening up for thought.,155,,
1238,0.97,9296.654,9301.091,Just on the process that you've outlined?,156,,
1239,0.97,9301.091,9302.426,"Yes, please.",157,,
1240,0.97,9302.426,9308.032,"Yeah, why signal my support for that approach.",158,,
1241,0.97,9308.032,9320.044,"I have continued to like, you counselor member Herbold here, some expressions of desire to want to spend a little bit more time with the legislation.",158,,
1242,0.97,9320.044,9342.299,"Frankly I've heard that from the executive and the Federal police monitor, but I've also heard it from folks in the community who also would appreciate a little bit more time with the substitute bill before we form a committee recommendation.",158,,
1243,0.97,9342.299,9362.119,"So I think I'm seeing an agreement in holding off a committee recommendation, and I would be supportive of putting the substitute bill before us as the thing that we continue to discuss, but holding Offon a committee recommendation seems to make sense to me at this point.",158,,
1244,0.97,9362.119,9364.788,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez.",159,,
1245,0.97,9364.788,9376.8,Other thoughts in the process I'm protesting with the encouragement from the Council President?,159,,
1246,0.97,9376.8,9378.535,Okay.,159,,
1247,0.97,9378.535,9400.357,"Well seeing none, I'm going to take that as agreement, again not on the substance of either the original bill or the substitute, but I'm going to take that as consent on the recommended process.",159,,
1248,0.97,9400.357,9409.5,So I will prove the proposed substitute as listed on the agenda.,159,,
1249,0.97,9409.5,9410.768,Is there a second?,159,,
1250,0.97,9410.768,9411.068,Second.,160,,
1251,0.97,9411.068,9412.903,Thank you.,161,,
1252,0.97,9412.903,9428.485,Would the clerk please call the role on the proposed substitute replacing the bill that's on the agenda.,161,,
1253,0.97,9428.485,9430.22,Council President Gonzalez.,161,,
1254,0.97,9430.22,9432.489,I'm sorry.,162,,
1255,0.97,9432.489,9432.689,Aye.,162,,

1259,0.97,9438.862,9446.069,"Councilmember Sawant, I think I'm about to ask Maybe the same question.",166,,
1260,0.97,9446.069,9449.74,We need to debate.,167,,
1261,0.97,9449.74,9455.813,"We need to discussion the policy, my apology.",168,,
1262,0.97,9455.813,9460.551,"Councilmember Sawant, is that what you were going to ask as well .?",169,,
1263,0.97,9460.551,9476.233,"Yes, and from the beginning, I couldn't figure out how the position on the substitutes is divorced from this vote, anyway, Yeah, it's the same question.",170,,
1264,0.97,9476.233,9486.577,Let's hear from folks on the motion before us.,171,,
1265,0.97,9486.577,9486.944,My apologies.,171,,
1266,0.97,9486.944,9487.411,Councilmember Lewis.,171,,
1267,0.97,9487.411,9493.283,"Thank you, Madam chair, and thank you for bringing forward this substitute bill today into this conversation.",172,,
1268,0.97,9493.283,9501.191,"I know that a lot of work has gone into crafting this, and consulting with a very broad constituency.",172,,
1269,0.97,9501.191,9517.407,"I just want to comment on a couple of things that I like about the substitute, and a couple of things that I'm still frustrated about regarding broader process.",172,,
1270,0.97,9517.407,9526.516,"Not necessarily confined to the work of this Committee, but just a broader situation we find ourselves in, with the broader public safety conversation.",172,,
1271,0.97,9526.516,9535.125,Because we heard a lot in public comment that I don't really disagree with on any end of the spectrum.,172,,
1272,0.97,9535.125,9556.246,"We heard from a lot of downtown residents that are incredibly frustrated, that there's a massive concentration of people in severe urban poverty, with severe needs that are going Unaddressed, and that is manifesting in public safety challenges that are dramatically Impacting Liveability.",172,,
1273,0.97,9556.246,9573.964,"We heard from a number of people Testifying that when certain lines are drawn from the Council, in terms of the expectation of what the police Department will do in response to mandates from the Council, that there needs to be a hard and fast enforcement of those rules.",172,,
1274,0.97,9573.964,9580.804,"And I think in a lot of respects, this bill balances a lot of those considerations.",172,,
1275,0.97,9580.804,9583.64,I want to go into talking about how I think they do.,172,,
1276,0.97,9583.64,9596.353,"I also just want to take this opportunity, sort of outside the four corners of this, to Outlie some of the places I hope this conversation goes, moving forward from here.",172,,
1277,0.97,9596.353,9608.632,"So first, I want to speak to some of the things I really like in the bill in terms of investments to immediately respond to some of the issues we are seeing in the community.",172,,
1278,0.97,9608.632,9628.151,"First, Madam President, as you, or sorry, Madam chair, as you mentioned earlier in this conversation, either way that we go, be it the original bill or the substitute, there is no impact whatsoever on the police staffing plan that was adopted by this Council last fall.",172,,
1279,0.97,9628.151,9633.256,This bill will not result in fewer patrol officers.,172,,
1280,0.97,9633.256,9636.827,This bill will not result in more patrol officers.,172,,
1281,0.97,9636.827,9640.297,"On that topic, this bill is neutral.",172,,
1282,0.97,9640.297,9641.098,That is a separate issue.,172,,
1283,0.97,9641.098,9646.336,And I appreciate you addressing that at the beginning of this.,172,,
1284,0.97,9646.336,9655.746,I think there is widespread confusion amongst members of the public.,172,,
1285,0.97,9655.746,9667.924,Amongst certain editorial boards in various sources of the media that we're debating will have an impact on patrol members and it will not.,172,,
1286,0.97,9667.924,9670.26,That is what I want to point out.,172,,
1287,0.97,9670.26,9682.239,"But it will have an impact on on the ground services that are civilian, and public health oriented that can come in and help smooth our transition to a public safety system that emphasizes those kinds of services more.",172,,
1288,0.97,9682.239,9696.153,"I think some people forget that the community service officers, which are civilian essentially social worker unit, that this Council has wanted to move into a civilian Department.",172,,
1289,0.97,9696.153,9705.395,"I continue to support that kind of a movement and that we almost did last budget cycle, but it wasn't quite ready for that kind of a transfer.",172,,
1290,0.97,9705.395,9721.278,"The CSO's, even though they're still housed Unfortunately, in the police Department, have a community organizing, and community service function that is separate from a Carcerial law enforcement method.",172,,
1291,0.97,9721.278,9752.375,"Just to give a bit of an overview, and people can read the Bios Online, which are a group of talented, the organizers or the officers in the community service officer Corps currently are former officers for one America, former practicing social workers, a worker that collectively speaks fluent in nine languages.",172,,
1292,0.97,9752.375,9753.31,Former Union organizers.,172,,
1293,0.97,9753.31,9769.392,"These are the folks that under your substitute bill, Madam chair, we're going to get more of, and we're going to expand the service Footprint of the service officers and see that tangible impact in the community in short order.",172,,
1294,0.97,9769.392,9782.472,"And I think investing more in community service officers is a good idea, and that investment we make into community service officers hopefully will be transferred into a civilian control Department, even though aren't at this time.",172,,
1295,0.97,9782.472,9796.92,"Even though technically that is still in the police Department, it is not in a service that we would traditionally associate with traditional policing, and certainly is more in keeping with the model we are trying to transition to.",172,,
1296,0.97,9796.92,9808.131,"This is also going to fund, as Greg laid out, five civilian mental health responders from the human services Department.",172,,
1297,0.97,9808.131,9813.003,That is money still being taken out of SPD and redirected.,172,,
1298,0.97,9813.003,9844.868,"They're going to be stood up on a faster Timeline than some of our other that folks for public comment will be addressing, they'll be addressed on a way to intervene in public health challenges, it's going to be focused on sending appropriate--that is critical.",172,,
1299,0.97,9844.868,9847.804,It's going to address the public records backlog.,172,,
1300,0.97,9847.804,9874.164,"Some of this we should call the public media relief package, because I know from talking to journalists for years that there is massive consternation about the slow trickle of critical information for the public to be aware of the activities of one of the largest law enforcement agencies of the Pacific Northwest.",172,,
1301,0.97,9874.164,9876.633,So that investment is going to be made.,172,,
1302,0.97,9876.633,9885.141,"On top of all of this, we're going to free up $2 million for Participatory budgeting to bring the total to $32 million.",172,,
1303,0.97,9885.141,9937.193,"So there is still a significant investment that is additive to the par ties Partisipatory budgeting, because of the tangible alternatives to policing that are going to get funded and move as a result of the substitute, I'm going to support the substitute today, and I want to speak a little more broadly at this point, just to express that we need to keep our discussion and debate focused on what I think the to really emphasize and describe to the general public what some of the alternatives are going to be to policing as we reduce policing and Scaling it up, and what the plan is going to be to scale those things up.",172,,
1304,0.97,9937.193,9945.235,We have set up a very comprehensive and consultative process to do that which is appropriate.,172,,
1305,0.97,9945.235,9951.074,We're going to be making generational paradigm changing and shifting investments in our public safety system.,172,,
1306,0.97,9951.074,9975.899,"Those investments Unfortunately, to be consultative to the point that they should be, to be lasting to have the feedback and the guidance of leaders to fully shape and build those systems takes longer than a couple of months, and we have received solid work through the flat brilliance research project.",172,,
1307,0.97,9975.899,10004.16,"We're working on setting up a Participatory budget process to scale and fund a lot of those interventions, and I want to just take a second to maybe highlight if we could pursue related to that work or on a separate track, or maybe resources that aren't the Participatory budget resources, investing and scanning some kind of low acute response system, like Star.",172,,
1308,0.97,10004.16,10040.33,"The reason I bring this up separately is because you know, I think the other day in his column, Danny Westneed had a little bit of a point that I think as far as the public SEES when they see these discussions, they're constantly seeing conversations around cutting the police, which I think there's broad agreement that the police are not the best practice first Responder for mental health, for urban poverty, for low Acuity crimes of survival that can be addressed by addressing poverty and the source as a poverty, and investing in community.",172,,
1309,0.97,10040.33,10052.409,"And we don't really need to look that far to find some first response services that are in a lot of respects, best practices that have been proven by the analysis and data of some of these cities.",172,,
1310,0.97,10052.409,10070.16,"I just want to briefly talk a little bit about the Star program, and just advocate publicly hear that maybe on a separate track, we try to carve off some resource for Hsd to conduct a Star program within our provider community.",172,,
1311,0.97,10070.16,10094.784,"I just want to raise that Star, for the folks from downtown that called in during public comment responds Affectively, and Proactively to the types of public health related instances that have been described by a lot of people, people at the downtown court, people who are intoxicated, people who are Trespassing.",172,,

1315,0.97,10110.767,10140.029,"Just to put out there, the cost of Star, for $1.4 million, Denver estimates that they're going to be able to have four vans, currently one Van is a pilot, they released their 6 month report at the beginning of this year for example $1.4 million, Denver is going to get four vans, so they're going to increase is from one Van to four.",172,,
1316,0.97,10140.029,10145.969,"That.Would include six teams, that's an Emt and a mental health Clinician.",172,,
1317,0.97,10145.969,10160.25,"That's six medics, six mental health Clinicians for $1.4 million a year to allow seven day a week coverage to immediately respond with professionals on the ground, to deal with these low Acuity issues, and get people the assistance and the happy they need.",172,,
1318,0.97,10160.25,10182.472,To put it in perspective with the 5.4 million we're discussing.,172,,
1319,0.97,10182.639,10217.574,"I only raise that to say that the cost of a lot of these replacements relative to the cost of police is something that's really worth considering, especially when we look at what the result has been in the Star program in Denver, in how that has actually responded to a lot of these ongoing chronic issues on the street in a more effective way, emphasizing public health, and emphasizing low Acuity first response.",172,,
1320,0.97,10217.574,10217.974,That's tertiary.,172,,
1321,0.97,10217.974,10240.396,"That's unrelated to our discussion of the bill here, but I do think we need to emphasize as the Council on part of our effort that there are great alternatives out there that are going to be able to fill the void of what a lot of folks in the community are expressing concern about, and seeing in terms of some of the public health, and public safety challenges that we have as a city.",172,,
1322,0.97,10240.396,10262.452,"And that actually in a lot of ways with the CSO's and with the mental health responders, we can get some of those resources out there faster, but we need to keep building toward something like a Star response program that, you know, is community based, provider based, and can respond to the types of issues that we are seeing.",172,,
1323,0.97,10262.452,10264.687,So I'm going to support the substitute today.,172,,
1324,0.97,10264.687,10269.659,"With that, I don't have anything else to add, and I'll turn it back over, Madam chair.",172,,

1357,0.97,10560.149,10568.124,The lesson for our movements is we must depend on our own strength.,175,,
1358,0.97,10568.124,10568.391,Enquote.,175,,
1359,0.97,10568.391,10584.64,"Now do Councilmembers remember that they cannot Defund by 50% in 2020 because reducing the number of police officers would take up to four months, but they promise to do so in 2021 then do Councilmembers remember saying they would not increase the police budget in 2020?",175,,
1360,0.97,10584.64,10597.119,"Then do Councilmembers say they would increase the police budget in 2020 by $5.4 million, but they will suddenly cut that from the budget in 2021?",175,,
1361,0.97,10597.119,10605.261,"At this point, anyone who is surprised by this bill is Unfortunately, woefully naive.",175,,
1362,0.97,10605.261,10610.9,"I have no doubt, there will be supplemental budgets this year to add even more to the police Fund.",175,,
1363,0.97,10610.9,10628.05,"Our movement demanded the police be Defunded by 50%, to cut the police resources used to violently police peaceful Blm protests, but not only that, to harass and abuse communities of color on an almost daily basis.",175,,
1364,0.97,10628.05,10636.759,"I oppose this substitution, and urge Councilmembers to pass the original bill, following through on at least this one promise made to the black lives matter movement.",175,,
1365,0.97,10636.759,10643.532,I also want to address the issue that was discussed during Greg Doss's presentation.,175,,
1366,0.97,10643.532,10649.572,This same substitute bill releases an additional $5 million in the police budget that was previously bound by a proposal.,175,,
1367,0.97,10649.572,10663.853,"That means that the substitute bill as whole gives the police access to $5 million, so it increases the available police budget by over $2 million.",175,,
1368,0.97,10663.853,10673.229,"As Malcolm X Famously said if you stick a knife in my back 9 inches and pull it out 6 inches, that's not progress.",175,,
1369,0.97,10673.229,10682.638,"I think theme will need to get organized and fight for a board with full powers over the police, including hiring, and firing subpoena powers.",175,,
1370,0.97,10682.638,10710.7,"My observation from having talked to hundreds of people in the politically broad spectrum is even those working people who are not sure about Defunding, also strongly support an elected community Oversite board with full powers over the police, so it's absolutely essential that community members and protesters and working people and Progressive labor units understand that relying on the political establishment does not work, we will have to build an independent fighting movement for this.",175,,
1371,0.97,10710.7,10711.367,Thank you.,175,,
1372,0.97,10711.367,10717.907,"Thank you, Councilmember is a want.",176,,
1373,0.97,10717.907,10718.841,"Councilmember Morales, please.",176,,
1374,0.97,10718.841,10719.208,Thank you.,177,,
1375,0.97,10719.208,10719.575,I'll be quick.,177,,
1376,0.97,10719.575,10724.28,I know some of us are late for another meeting.,177,,
1377,0.97,10724.28,10727.85,"I want to say that I do, I'm struggling with this substitute bill.",177,,
1378,0.97,10727.85,10738.26,I feel like this is really giving the Department back everything that they're asking for and we really should hold the line on budget accountability for the budget.,177,,
1379,0.97,10738.26,10741.931,"As I said before, there were decisions made.",177,,
1380,0.97,10741.931,10747.103,"The department made choices last year to spend, to Overspend on their overtime budget.",177,,
1381,0.97,10747.103,10757.98,"So I think we need to move that $5.4 million out of the Department, and leave SPD to budget with the remaining savings that they have.",177,,
1382,0.97,10757.98,10761.951,Rather than sending a message that overruns are acceptable.,177,,
1383,0.97,10761.951,10767.156,"Made the budget choices and like every other Department, should operate now within those constraints.",177,,
1384,0.97,10767.156,10777.399,"So I think the original bill was about holding the Department to some budget accountability for their overspends last year, and I think that remains the issue.",177,,
1385,0.97,10777.399,10785.241,So I will not be supporting the substitute.,177,,
1386,0.97,10785.241,10787.176,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,178,,
1387,0.97,10787.176,10795.651,"If there are no further comments on the bill, I just want to briefly say, this is not a $5.4 million cut.",178,,
1388,0.97,10795.651,10799.722,It is a $3 million cut.,178,,
1389,0.97,10799.722,10815.738,"It does maintain a proviso, and allows this committee to stay in the driver's seat as we receive future reports from SPD on staffing and overtime issues.",178,,
1390,0.97,10815.738,10841.163,"And so for me, this is maintaining accountability while also listening to a broad sector of the community about what community needs, community safety means for them and I look forward to continue work with this Committee in driving forward those discussions.",178,,
1391,0.97,10841.163,10849.238,"With that, will the clerk please call the roll.",178,,
1392,0.97,10849.238,10851.607,Council President Gonzalez.,179,,

1406,0.97,10879.101,10891.213,Understand that we should expect to hear more from the monitor and potentially from the court as this moves forward.,190,,
