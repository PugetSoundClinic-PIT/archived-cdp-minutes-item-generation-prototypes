188,0.97,838.37,850.282,Thank you for the faith you have shown to allow for me to serve city wide and position aid for second time.,83,,
189,0.97,850.282,859.525,Four years ago got elected at time where we were in the cities across our country worried about what would come from the Federal delegation.,83,,
190,0.97,859.525,878.377,"Having just had an election of--Donald Trump at the time, I talked a lot about how cities would be the first line of offense and the last line of defense in this time that was--tremendously--Engrained in turmoil and in a divided country at that time.",83,,
191,0.97,878.377,885.251,Since then we have seen some of those division continue to be spread apart.,83,,
192,0.97,885.251,888.754,We have seen people lose their homes.,83,,
193,0.97,888.754,894.894,We have seen small businesses lose their--shops and we have seen people lose their livelihoods.,83,,
194,0.97,894.894,903.669,We I think in Seattle have shown what it looks like to be on that front line of offense and that last line of defense.,83,,
195,0.97,903.669,920.586,We stood up more housing than we have seen in the previous years by passing jump start progressive revenue to invest in affordable housing and equitable development and we did that in the first few months of Covid because we knew that hard times were coming.,83,,
196,0.97,920.586,939.104,In my first term we stood up protections for workers who had been long left out of State and Federal labor standards by expanding rights for domestic workers that gained national attention and hotel workers who have higher rates of back injury than those who are working in coal mines.,83,,

257,0.97,1238.47,1243.041,I taught courses in Anthro and women studies for a few years.,106,,
258,0.97,1243.041,1249.881,I decided to leave to--have a more direct impact on my community in public service.,106,,
259,0.97,1249.881,1259.057,And I got my start in 2002 taking a job in Richard's office as a legislative assistant.,106,,
260,0.97,1259.057,1266.164,"Skied him to administer my oath today because over the course of ten years of working with him, I learned so much.",106,,
261,0.97,1266.164,1270.202,He showed me and became my mentor.,106,,
262,0.97,1270.202,1279.077,"He showed me the importance of being transparent, about the problem you are trying to fix and the benefits you are trying to achieve.",106,,
263,0.97,1279.077,1290.656,"Of really taking your time to consider all the options that you have gotten by listening, truly listening to the public and all stake holders, not just the loudest voices.",106,,
264,0.97,1290.656,1296.561,And paying attention to detail cause that is where the devil really lives.,106,,
265,0.97,1296.561,1303.702,"And then finally to set clear performance Metrics and then if you fall short, to correct course.",106,,
266,0.97,1303.702,1309.241,And I do have some experience with that.,106,,
267,0.97,1309.241,1310.842,"And so--um, fun fact.",106,,
268,0.97,1310.842,1315.547,I met my husband matt at WTO.,106,,
269,0.97,1315.547,1328.026,He was a home brewer and later when he decided to leave his law career in hospitality--I jumped right in.,106,,
270,0.97,1328.026,1330.095,We launched Fremont brewing in 2009.,106,,
271,0.97,1330.095,1346.511,I have to admit that--it took some convincing because being fairly risk--it turned out to be a vehicle for myself to put my progressive values to work.,106,,
272,0.97,1346.511,1356.955,By supporting environmental and social justice Non-Profits and promoting us stain ability and providing extensive benefits to our employees.,106,,
273,0.97,1356.955,1366.198,And then being on the receiving end I learn Houd difficult it is to start and grow a small business in Seattle.,106,,
274,0.97,1366.198,1380.846,"And so--this--fundamentals of good Governance from Richard's office and in my experience starting this business, these are the things I bring in and--that shape my approach and also my priorities.",106,,
275,0.97,1380.846,1389.254,Top of which is--achieving an equitable economic recovery.,106,,
276,0.97,1389.254,1390.822,Small businesses are struggling.,106,,
277,0.97,1390.822,1407.539,I ask to be chair of economic development because these are the--they form the fabric of our neighborhoods and they are the job creators and they--the small businesses provide the opportunity to develop and build generational wealth.,106,,
278,0.97,1407.539,1409.074,They are hurting.,106,,
279,0.97,1409.074,1412.944,They are struggling to survive and families are really struggling at the same time.,106,,
280,0.97,1412.944,1424.289,I know there is much more we can do to support small businesses and retain those jobs.,106,,
281,0.97,1424.289,1433.498,"So, on my committee work plan will be--first of all a downtown and neighborhood district revitalization plan.",106,,
282,0.97,1433.498,1445.177,Also a plan to reduce the displacement of minority owned businesses by improving access to capital and increasing technical support for entrepreneurs.,106,,
283,0.97,1445.177,1454.452,Now of course you can't--excuse me while I--wet my whistle here.,106,,
284,0.97,1454.452,1466.631,We can't talk about recovery without talking about public safety because I heard loud and clear from business owners that crime was one of their biggest concerns and of residents as well.,106,,
285,0.97,1466.631,1486.017,So I will work with ensure our fire and police departments are adequately staffed and Resourced to bring down 911 response times and to reverse the trend on gun violence and also to advance the critical work of police reform.,106,,
286,0.97,1486.017,1487.919,Improving account ability goes hand in hand.,106,,
287,0.97,1487.919,1490.956,It is not mutually exclusive with keeping everyone safe.,106,,
288,0.97,1490.956,1494.092,So that is a top priority of mine.,106,,
289,0.97,1494.092,1499.498,The other big concern of course is our worsening homelessness crisis.,106,,
290,0.97,1499.498,1519.117,So I will support the regional homelessness authorities implementation plan and starting with the proposal of moving downtown Encamment President Pment residents into housing.,106,,
291,0.97,1519.117,1520.118,We need begin funding.,106,,
292,0.97,1520.118,1524.623,"This is a big, huge, missing piece of our response homelessness.",106,,
293,0.97,1524.623,1528.26,We can't wait to state and Federal dollars.,106,,
294,0.97,1528.26,1533.431,We have to really Prioritize resources and begin funding these services.,106,,
295,0.97,1533.431,1547.078,"So, these are--some of the big you are Gept issue--for urgent issues.",106,,
296,0.97,1547.078,1559.057,"Solving constituent problems and ensuring the--the delivery of essential charter services, police, fire, parks, libraries and transportation, that is local government's first job.",106,,
297,0.97,1559.057,1567.566,And so I will be committing our office to being responsive and to getting the basics done right.,106,,
298,0.97,1567.566,1580.178,"So, I have to say that--whatever the policy issue, I will be taking a pragmatic approach to fulfilling my duties of city council member with accountability and humility.",106,,
299,0.97,1580.178,1584.015,"When I say pragmatic approach, here is what I mean.",106,,
300,0.97,1584.015,1594.859,I mean aligning our regulatory structure with our policy goals so for example what are the barriers in the municipal code we can remove?,106,,
301,0.97,1594.859,1604.402,What is the authority that the state gives us to--and incentives we have available to us to meet those policy goals?,106,,
302,0.97,1604.402,1611.009,And then the ultimate goal of course is to make an immediate difference in the lives of people right now.,106,,
303,0.97,1611.009,1614.813,That is why mean by pragmatic approach.,106,,
