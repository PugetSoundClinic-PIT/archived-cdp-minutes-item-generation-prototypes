75,0.97,322.989,327.06,"So with that Council member Lewis, you will be starting us off.",37,,
76,0.97,327.06,331.864,I'm hoping what we have is an opportunity to be a little bit more conversational.,37,,
77,0.97,331.864,337.67,"Allow the person that's speaking to kind of control, you know, and ask people what their thoughts and concerns are.",37,,

82,0.97,352.218,356.522,Congratulations on seeing you in this new role presiding over the new Council briefing on a new day.,38,,
83,0.97,356.522,361.961,"It's great to be here, and I appreciate the opportunity to kick us off this afternoon.",38,,
84,0.97,361.961,371.404,"I don't have a whole lot of items, so I will put the brief back in briefing here and be able to hand it off to Council member Morales in short order.",38,,
85,0.97,371.404,373.773,First I wanted to flag.,38,,
86,0.97,373.773,378.211,Coming up soon on February 8 we are going to be going back to the ballot box.,38,,
87,0.97,378.211,393.059,"I know it feels like we're voting a lot these days, but we'll be voting in a special election in February for the upcoming school district levy renewals, proposition one, the operating levy and proposition two the capital levy.",38,,
88,0.97,393.059,413.479,"In the past the Seattle city council under the leadership of former Council members have passed a resolution with the Mayor Concurring, endorsing those levies, working with some of the advocates of the levy and in particular the former school board District director Peter Mayor.",38,,
89,0.97,413.479,434.167,My office has put together a draft resolution for the consideration of the Council that I'm hoping to bring forward on introduction referral for discussion among colleagues and what the Council President's office on potentially having the city weigh in as we have in the past supporting the renewal of those critical levies.,38,,
90,0.97,434.167,441.941,I mean the school district just flagging my intention to bring that forward and look forward to having a conversation.,38,,
91,0.97,441.941,455.655,"If that is something the Council will be willing to do, of course, I'm hoping that we will give them the critical importance of those levies to our partnership with the Seattle school district.",38,,
92,0.97,455.655,465.565,"Hopefully I will be distributing that resolution in a short order for plenty of consideration and process in advance of that February 8 deadline, which is coming up.",38,,
93,0.97,465.565,469.836,"Ballots will be going out soon, like it feels like they always are.",38,,
94,0.97,469.836,478.978,I do also want to recognize that I believe is it today or tomorrow that Washington state legislative session is going to be Gaveling in.,38,,
95,0.97,478.978,482.048,"Of course, there's a number of bills.",38,,
96,0.97,482.048,490.122,The one that's very relevant and we have been working on for a series of cycles and partnership with the Senator.,38,,
97,0.97,490.122,509.275,"The Senate bill 54-28, this is a bill that would exempt from review and emergency sheltering asset such as tiny House villages, but also other types of emergency shelters that might implicate needing review.",38,,
98,0.97,509.275,528.261,Just very briefly it would help the city of Seattle's homelessness response immensely if we were able to wave review in a Seemless and unambiguous way for a lot of these homeless shelters and assets where she been working to stand up.,38,,
99,0.97,528.261,535.434,Tiny House village should only take five to six weeks to build.,38,,
100,0.97,535.434,536.836,Last year it took 11 months.,38,,
101,0.97,536.836,539.605,A big reason for that is the Timeline.,38,,
102,0.97,539.605,544.543,There were other reasons we don't need to go into dealing with the logistics of getting those set up.,38,,
103,0.97,544.543,548.314,The review is a big part to our legislative delegation.,38,,
104,0.97,548.314,565.865,If there is a way you're looking to be a significant partner in waiving red tape and waiving regulatory hurdles that are free and of no cost to speed this up and speed up the homelessness response.,38,,
105,0.97,565.865,567.767,I know we got pretty close last session.,38,,
106,0.97,567.767,573.172,I'd like to get it over the finish line this session if possible.,38,,
107,0.97,573.172,577.576,It will be a big boost to respond with urgency.,38,,
108,0.97,577.576,603.302,I would remind folks the reason we were able to move in the fall and get everyone to move into some kind of shelter option out of the elements in advance I might add of a massive snow Tam is because we were able to stand up a large amount of tiny House villages.,38,,
109,0.97,603.302,608.674,We can do more of that and Senator bill 5428 will help us do that.,38,,
110,0.97,608.674,621.454,"So strongly, strongly urge our legislative partners to work with us on that and look forward to talking to the government relations and how we can move that ball forward.",38,,
111,0.97,621.454,623.122,Finally King County regional homeless authorities.,38,,
112,0.97,623.122,642.141,"If you want to do one shout out that the current request for proposals is out to build three new sheltering assets including power shelters, models, that information is on the key and their Website.",38,,
113,0.97,642.141,645.478,Just a shout out to all of our provider partners.,38,,
114,0.97,645.478,648.28,You have until January 28 to submit proposals.,38,,
115,0.97,648.28,677.143,Please do try to take advantage of this partnership between the city of Seattle and the King County regional homeless authority to really get in there and help us stand up through more sheltering assets as we saw in the fall those sheltering assets can be helping us and provide people a safe and dignified place to look.,38,,
116,0.97,677.143,690.056,This will help us build on those efforts in a big way.,38,,
117,0.97,690.056,690.589,Please bring forward work.,38,,
118,0.97,690.589,706.505,"And finally I will be having a King County regional homeless authority board meeting this Thursday where we will be approving the 2022 budget, receiving updates and information from the regional leadership team.",38,,
119,0.97,706.505,707.706,I do actually want to ask.,38,,
120,0.97,707.706,724.09,"I don't know if this is best directed to Council President or who, but I do think we will need to have a plan for Thursday on who is going to be attending that meeting as our second delegate to that body.",38,,
121,0.97,724.09,751.383,I believe Council member Herbold and Council member Mosqueda are still designated as alternates and maybe for the time being that might be the best way to deal with making sure we're represented is having either Council member Herbold or Mosqueda attend as the alternate if we are not yet ready to designate who our second permanent person to that body will be given that it was Council President Gonzalez who is no longer serving on the Council.,38,,
122,0.97,751.383,763.863,"So just making sure we have a plan going forward, so we have both of our seats filled for this meeting where we approve the budget and hear some important updates on how we're going to move forward with that partnership.",38,,
123,0.97,763.863,771.504,So I would throw that out for the consideration of the collective here before turning it over to Council member Morales.,38,,
124,0.97,771.504,774.006,Otherwise I don't have any additional updates.,38,,
125,0.97,774.006,775.374,"Okay, that was brief.",39,,
126,0.97,775.374,775.674,Thank you.,39,,
127,0.97,775.674,778.277,"Yeah, it is Council member Herbold.",39,,
128,0.97,778.277,784.65,"She will be in that seat, so she will be there in present.",39,,
129,0.97,784.65,787.82,She represents the Seattle city council.,39,,
130,0.97,787.82,791.223,"Great, that's all settled.",40,,
131,0.97,791.223,795.361,I can turn it over to Council member Morales.,40,,
132,0.97,795.361,797.329,Any questions about my reports?,40,,
133,0.97,797.329,802.067,"Seeing and hearing none, turning it over to Council member Úmorales.",40,,
134,0.97,802.067,805.905,"Thank you, council member Lewis.",41,,
135,0.97,805.905,810.075,Efficient with our new method already.,41,,
136,0.97,810.075,812.545,"Good afternoon everybody, happy new year.",41,,
137,0.97,812.545,813.445,Thank you Council President Juarez.,41,,
138,0.97,813.445,814.813,Nice to see you in your seat.,41,,
139,0.97,814.813,821.954,"As this is our first briefing for 2022, I do want to take a moment to welcome Council member Nelson and her team.",41,,
140,0.97,821.954,829.094,We had an opportunity to meet last week briefly.,41,,
141,0.97,829.094,834.633,So look forward to working with you and your staff.,41,,
142,0.97,834.633,846.011,"The neighborhoods civil rights, education, and culture committee will be meeting this year every second and fourth Friday at 9:30 in the morning.",41,,
143,0.97,846.011,849.081,"Our first meeting would have been scheduled this week, but I'm not ready.",41,,
144,0.97,849.081,852.918,I'm not sure if any of us are ready to meet this week.,41,,
145,0.97,852.918,857.656,We'll be meeting with departments this week particularly since there are three new departments in my committee.,41,,
146,0.97,857.656,869.735,"I do want to have a chance to meet with those directors to hear what their plans are for the year, see what looming issues we should be expecting especially in the first quarter.",41,,
147,0.97,869.735,876.642,And then we will have our first official meeting on the committee Friday January 28.,41,,
148,0.97,876.642,880.746,So as we begin the new year and our work with the new administration.,41,,
149,0.97,880.746,889.955,"I do want to take a moment to say thank you to Lockhart, the director of the office of civil rights.",41,,
150,0.97,889.955,913.545,She's served as a really important steady voice in the Department as we move into work that gives community access to power whether we're talking about the community task force on our criminal legal system reforms or setting up the new budgeting process that we will be beginning this year.,41,,
151,0.97,913.545,922.354,These are programs that really give our neighbors some control over how their tax dollars get spent.,41,,
152,0.97,922.354,936.468,And so Marigold was instrumental in helping to create the community investment division of the Department to really hold that work of grant making and engaging deeply with the community.,41,,
153,0.97,936.468,948.681,"So he's leaving OCR to take a position, and I'm excited she'll be taking her passion and commitment to racial equity and to supporting young people of color in particular to deal.",41,,
154,0.97,948.681,951.684,So I know they will continue to benefit.,41,,
155,0.97,951.684,956.889,The city will continue to benefit from her important work and from the voice she provides.,41,,
156,0.97,956.889,957.289,And I'm excited.,41,,
157,0.97,957.289,961.427,I'll continue to be able to work with her.,41,,
158,0.97,961.427,964.129,My capacity in overseeing a deal now.,41,,
159,0.97,964.129,973.205,"So Marigold if you're listening, I just want to take a moment to thank you for your commitment to working, serving the people of Seattle.",41,,
160,0.97,973.205,975.407,Moving on just a quick district update.,41,,
161,0.97,975.407,985.184,I want to give a special shout out and thank you to the Pharmacy.,41,,
162,0.97,985.184,996.228,"He and his staff, his whole team has been instrumental in providing testing, Vaccinations, and now boosters to our neighbors in South Seattle.",41,,
163,0.97,996.228,1002.167,He's been doing this for a year or more now.,41,,
164,0.97,1002.167,1015.781,"Really working deeply, knocking on doors, making sure our neighbors in South Seattle know particularly in the Ophello neighborhood and new Holly to know these opportunities are available to get tested and to get vaccines.",41,,
165,0.97,1015.781,1020.285,So I do want to thank them for the work they continue to do.,41,,
166,0.97,1020.285,1027.026,I don't know if any of us would have expected we would be heading into our third year of Covid.,41,,
167,0.97,1027.026,1033.499,It's been really hard on our school families in particular.,41,,
168,0.97,1033.499,1041.84,"I'm sure we're all hearing parents, students, teachers are frustrated on what it means to be moving into another school year.",41,,
169,0.97,1041.84,1048.881,I think I'm the only parent on the city council who has children in Seattle public school.,41,,
170,0.97,1048.881,1055.821,"I can tell you our educators are scared, our administrators are scared, our students are frustrated and scared.",41,,
171,0.97,1055.821,1059.992,Really that continued trauma is having an affect on everybody's well being.,41,,
172,0.97,1059.992,1068.0,"So I think it's important that we do everything we can to support them, to keep our school community safe.",41,,
173,0.97,1068.0,1079.278,"Yesterday, Sunday morning, hundreds of people turned out to South shore elementary to get Vaccinated and boosted thanks to the work they're doing.",41,,
174,0.97,1079.278,1088.153,I'm thankful my own son was able to get boosted.,41,,
175,0.97,1088.153,1095.594,I just want to know there are some dealing with this every day and they are needing our support.,41,,
176,0.97,1095.594,1098.464,I want to talk for a little bit about little Saigon.,41,,
177,0.97,1098.464,1107.206,"I'm working with friends of little Saigon to coordinate a neighborhood meeting with local business owners, with our crime prevention Coordinators, and others.",41,,
178,0.97,1107.206,1112.411,We all know how complex the issues are that our communities are facing.,41,,
179,0.97,1112.411,1140.272,"To address some of the illicit activity that's happening, some of the public issues, and the folks who are living Unhoused, all of these things are sort of converging and will require several different approaches to increase safety and to find solutions for that activity that's happening there.",41,,
180,0.97,1140.272,1146.211,To all that they are creating.,41,,
181,0.97,1146.211,1148.213,They are assessing how to engage.,41,,
182,0.97,1148.213,1161.894,My staff member is meeting with them down right now at Ethan King to engage on the intersection things that are happening there to really start moving people into services and to find stable housing for those who need it.,41,,
183,0.97,1161.894,1169.101,"And notifying me recently they are developing an action plan particularly for 12th and Jackson, so I hope to have more to share with you about that later.",41,,

185,0.97,1173.805,1188.921,"He's been in touch with the narcotics unit, with property theft unit, and has notified me they have--well this was a week or so ago, that they had identified a suspect in several of the shootings.",41,,
186,0.97,1188.921,1192.257,I will follow up to see what more I could learn there.,41,,
187,0.97,1192.257,1196.595,And also I know there's interest in Biweekly meetings.,41,,
188,0.97,1196.595,1198.13,I've been talking about the mt.,41,,
189,0.97,1198.13,1203.835,"Baker neighborhood for over a year now, so you know we're having Biweekly meetings with the folks in mt.",41,,
190,0.97,1203.835,1206.905,Baker to talk about similar issues.,41,,
191,0.97,1206.905,1223.689,"The folks in little Saigon are interested in trying to do something similar, so we are trying to coordinate some time on all of our calendar, so we can begin that process and really see how to make sure everybody is updated.",41,,
192,0.97,1223.689,1224.523,Speaking of mt.,41,,
193,0.97,1224.523,1236.268,"Baker our Biweekly meeting with the community is Wednesday, it's our first meeting before recess.",41,,
194,0.97,1236.268,1242.941,We will begin the regular work of making sure that Committee is safe as well.,41,,
195,0.97,1242.941,1245.41,That's all I have unless my colleague has questions.,41,,
196,0.97,1245.41,1250.916,First of all I got to watch you converge.,42,,
197,0.97,1250.916,1256.855,"So those of you who have not seen Council member Morales on there, well done.",42,,

205,0.97,1283.048,1285.851,"We've all enjoyed working with them, seeing the preschool.",44,,
206,0.97,1285.851,1291.556,I know you'll have conversations about preschool and infrastructure and capital and the mt.,44,,
207,0.97,1291.556,1294.526,Baker station and what we can do.,44,,
208,0.97,1294.526,1297.929,Thank you Council member Morales.,44,,

218,0.97,1334.866,1344.71,I have been asking through meetings in the chairs of the committees that I have been participating on to get a sense of your vision.,47,,
219,0.97,1344.71,1348.28,"Everybody has been great, rolling out the red carpet for me and my staff.",47,,

224,0.97,1371.203,1374.506,I'm completely supportive of a collaborative approach.,47,,
225,0.97,1374.506,1380.112,"I look forward to working with everybody, so thank you for setting that tone.",47,,
226,0.97,1380.112,1386.785,"My first committee, which would be tomorrow is canceled.",47,,
227,0.97,1386.785,1392.09,"The economic development, Útechnology, and city light Committee is canceled for obvious reasons.",47,,
228,0.97,1392.09,1395.527,But it will occur on January 26.,47,,
229,0.97,1395.527,1402.701,It is canceled perhaps for some of the same reasons that it's brand new for me as well.,47,,
230,0.97,1402.701,1412.177,"What I'm doing is meeting with the Department heads to get a sense of incoming legislation if any, and also central staff to plan my committee work plan.",47,,
231,0.97,1412.177,1414.446,So I look forward to that work.,47,,
232,0.97,1414.446,1417.983,I'm starting to meet with Stakeholders.,47,,
233,0.97,1417.983,1425.757,"I met with the directors of the Soto lines, and I will continue that work as in the coming couple of weeks.",47,,

235,0.97,1427.826,1429.194,I am excited to be here.,47,,
236,0.97,1429.194,1430.929,Thank you very much.,47,,
237,0.97,1430.929,1433.598,"If you have any questions, what are they?",47,,
238,0.97,1433.598,1434.833,I have one.,48,,
239,0.97,1434.833,1435.167,Yes?,49,,
240,0.97,1435.167,1441.907,"I am not going to lie, I Miss my office, so I will just lead with that.",50,,
241,0.97,1441.907,1442.207,[Laughter],50,,
242,0.97,1442.34,1445.11,But you've got a really nice one right now.,51,,
243,0.97,1445.11,1447.078,"I like your office better, but okay.",52,,
244,0.97,1447.078,1451.116,I like my neighbors.,53,,
245,0.97,1451.116,1452.117,[Laughter],53,,
246,0.97,1452.25,1456.822,Thank you Council member Nelson.,54,,
247,0.97,1456.822,1464.963,I now pass the talking stick to Council member Pedersen.,55,,
248,0.97,1464.963,1465.864,Good afternoon everybody.,56,,
249,0.97,1465.864,1473.905,"On tomorrow's full city council agenda there are no items on our committee of transportation, Seattle, public utilities.",56,,
250,0.97,1473.905,1485.116,"Our first meeting of 2022 for the Committee on public utilities will be held on Tuesday, February 1 at 9:30 in the morning.",56,,
251,0.97,1485.116,1494.359,This year we meet on the first and third Tuesdays of the month instead of Tuesdays.,56,,
252,0.97,1494.359,1503.201,We will finish our Ayenta as we get to the January 1 meeting date.,56,,
253,0.97,1503.201,1510.609,Regardless of the heavy snowstorms and the most recent drastically reduces mobility and delays the question of Seattle.,56,,
254,0.97,1510.609,1518.75,I agree with what I heard from many residents throughout the city that we saw key arterial roads clear of snow relatively fast.,56,,
255,0.97,1518.75,1528.326,"But would have appreciated additional attention to side streets especially when that impacts other city services such as the collection of trash, recycling, and compost.",56,,
256,0.97,1528.326,1552.817,I was pleased Sdot coordinated so well with other city departments and with King County Metro to Prioritize the clearing I also heard the concern that many property owners did not clear their sidewalks from snow.,56,,
257,0.97,1552.817,1561.326,"We appreciate all the workers from Seattle public of transportation, and several other city departments who braved the cold and icy conditions during and after these winter storms.",56,,
258,0.97,1561.326,1572.37,"I know everyone is eager to see the new Harrell administration, make sure crews quickly fill all those new potholes created by the winter storms and the heavy rains.",56,,
259,0.97,1572.37,1579.411,To report potholes you can call 206-684-Road.,56,,
260,0.97,1579.411,1600.799,"That's 206-684-7623 or use the find it, fix it App on the smart that's the only line Blog where you could find that at your service.",56,,
261,0.97,1600.799,1601.666,Again it's at your Service.Seattle.Gov.,56,,
262,0.97,1601.666,1607.806,District IV this past week I attended the northeast District Council's virtual meeting.,56,,
263,0.97,1607.806,1616.514,The northeast District Council includes representatives from approximately 10 community councils.,56,,
264,0.97,1616.514,1624.823,Throughout Seattle whon't Cos to share information from city departments and neighborhoods.,56,,
265,0.97,1624.823,1630.128,"And at last week's meeting we discussed homelessness, transportation.",56,,
266,0.97,1630.128,1634.332,"That concludes my report, so I will hand it over to Council member Sawant.",56,,
267,0.97,1634.332,1634.633,Thank you.,56,,
268,0.97,1634.633,1638.57,Do you want to ask if anyone has any questions?,57,,
269,0.97,1638.57,1642.073,Does anyone have any questions?,58,,
270,0.97,1642.073,1647.112,"Well Yeah, council member Herbold does.",59,,
271,0.97,1647.112,1663.728,"Council member Pedersen, I too heard from constituents who were disappointed more streets were not being plowed.",60,,
272,0.97,1663.728,1669.634,Also having the streets that were plowed don with more frequency.,60,,
273,0.97,1669.634,1687.819,"What I heard is that a lot of this had nothing to do with lack of prior planning, but there simply were not enough healthy people to drive the plows.",60,,
274,0.97,1687.819,1693.558,There have been separations in Sdot like there has been in many departments.,60,,
275,0.97,1693.558,1704.536,Further there are people who are ill associated with Covid.,60,,
276,0.97,1704.536,1708.139,I'm just to an issue like that.,60,,
277,0.97,1708.139,1716.948,That's not very satisfying for folks that you can't plan for people not being in the seats to drive the trucks.,60,,
278,0.97,1716.948,1734.466,And I know the city did in its efforts to do temporary assignments they did actually ask for folks with class C licenses to--so for folks who were not necessarily typically assigned to these functions in Sdot.,60,,
279,0.97,1734.466,1736.668,They were looking for more people to do them.,60,,
280,0.97,1736.668,1758.923,I'm just wondering if that is similar to what you've been told about sort of the action discussions of the snowstorm or is there something else that we Shoulded about in that sort of future storms.,60,,
281,0.97,1758.923,1771.769,It is accurate what you heard as well there was a shortage of workers and that Sdot did a good job of Leveraging other city departments for workers who could get out there and help.,61,,
282,0.97,1771.769,1790.054,And so there is the hope this isn't an anomaly due to the Covid pandemic and the current variant.,61,,
283,0.97,1790.054,1790.288,Okay.,62,,
284,0.97,1790.288,1797.729,So Council member Morales?,63,,
285,0.97,1797.729,1798.062,Thank you.,64,,
286,0.97,1798.062,1808.94,So we could probably talk for a couple of hours about this given that we all experienced stuff.,64,,
287,0.97,1808.94,1810.441,But Council President Juarez says no.,64,,
288,0.97,1810.441,1812.71,Similarly I have a lot of questions about this.,64,,
289,0.97,1812.71,1818.616,I think I will just flag for you Council member Pedersen in committee.,64,,
290,0.97,1818.616,1823.821,I think this is something I would like to dive into some more.,64,,
291,0.97,1823.821,1844.843,"I happen to live on a block that I cannot leave without going up a hill or down a hill every time it snows, and so I was not going anywhere because the sidewalks were icy, and I couldn't get out.",64,,
292,0.97,1844.843,1851.449,So I think for me the--you know when I first moved here 20 years ago Seattle hardly had any snow.,64,,
293,0.97,1851.449,1854.586,I think thanks to climate change that's different now.,64,,
294,0.97,1854.586,1871.035,We can anticipate we will have much more regular and possibly much more damaging snowstorms.,64,,
295,0.97,1871.035,1873.271,I'Men vest in the game we need with 35 trucks.,64,,
296,0.97,1873.271,1874.639,Maybe we need more.,64,,
297,0.97,1874.639,1894.259,"I don't know if you want to make a commitment given the timing or the number of storms we have, but I do think we need to take some time to understand how we do this better including how we clear sidewalks for, you know, the kids trying to get to school.",64,,
298,0.97,1894.259,1901.165,The folks who are wheelchair bound or have vision Impairments and just can't drive.,64,,
299,0.97,1901.165,1915.013,All I have to say is I'm hoping to spend some time in committee with you this year beginning to think about what we might do to modify the plans as they exist because they are not working for us anymore.,64,,
300,0.97,1915.013,1917.048,Thank you Council member Morales.,65,,
301,0.97,1917.048,1931.529,"And yes the nice thing about having Seattle public utilities also in our Committee is we have a lot of concerns raised by residents about the collection of trash, recycling, and compost as well.",65,,
302,0.97,1931.529,1935.566,That's connected to the still icy conditions.,65,,
303,0.97,1935.566,1946.144,Úso hearing from both of them actually at the same time would be really useful.,65,,
304,0.97,1946.144,1946.344,Okay.,65,,
305,0.97,1946.344,1957.855,"I think that is it, and I will pass it along to Council member Sawant.",65,,
306,0.97,1957.855,1958.189,Thank you.,66,,
307,0.97,1958.189,1960.792,Council member Strauss had a question.,67,,
308,0.97,1960.792,1962.827,"Oh Yep, go ahead Council member Strauss.",68,,
309,0.97,1962.827,1964.329,"Yes, thank you Council member Pedersen.",69,,
310,0.97,1964.329,1971.202,I was going to save this for my remarks since we're talking about the street Scape from the snow.,69,,
311,0.97,1971.202,1977.175,I'll NOTE we have significant potholes in my district and I'm sure across the city right now.,69,,
312,0.97,1977.175,1981.145,A couple axle breakers in our district.,69,,
313,0.97,1981.145,1982.714,I've already begun speaking with Sdot about this.,69,,
314,0.97,1982.714,1998.529,"It's important for us to keep in our mind if we were to go to fix the precipitation, we may need to go back and do that again.",69,,
315,0.97,1998.529,2002.1,I know Sdot is working quickly to address these issues.,69,,
316,0.97,2002.1,2008.306,They spoke to me about that today.,69,,
317,0.97,2008.306,2010.074,It does provide one interesting opportunity.,69,,
318,0.97,2010.074,2015.88,"These potholes in Ballard have unearthed Ballard's original brick streets as you know on May 29, 1907.",69,,
319,0.97,2015.88,2019.917,Ballard was Annexed into the city of Seattle.,69,,
320,0.97,2019.917,2022.32,Ballard was the second largest city in King County.,69,,
321,0.97,2022.32,2025.456,And those brick streets are still standing the test of time.,69,,
322,0.97,2025.456,2030.928,So just wanted to make that note.,69,,
323,0.97,2030.928,2032.23,Thank you Council member.,69,,
324,0.97,2032.23,2032.663,Thank you.,70,,
325,0.97,2032.663,2038.569,We'll turn it over to Council member Sawant.,70,,
326,0.97,2038.569,2041.539,"Thank you, good afternoon.",71,,
327,0.97,2041.539,2050.047,The Sustainability in Renters committee will hold its first meeting of the year at 9:30 A.M.,71,,
328,0.97,2050.047,2050.882,"On Friday, January 21.",71,,
329,0.97,2050.882,2054.085,At that meeting we will have a discussion on two bills.,71,,
330,0.97,2054.085,2063.394,"My office has been developing with the support of the activists, the Renters activists, and also city council central staff.",71,,
331,0.97,2063.394,2067.365,The first is a bill for comprehensive rent control.,71,,
332,0.97,2067.365,2077.008,The bill would cap annual rent increases to no more than the rate of inflection.,71,,
333,0.97,2077.008,2086.317,"The bill for my office has been used by corporate, and other parts of the country.",71,,
334,0.97,2086.317,2090.354,The rent control applies to all rental homes in all buildings.,71,,
335,0.97,2090.354,2097.495,Landlords cannot avoid the rent until provisions by forcing out their tenants like in some parts of California.,71,,

410,0.97,2651.382,2658.956,First off there are no items from the public safety and human services Committee on tomorrow's full council agenda.,73,,
411,0.97,2658.956,2670.367,We do have a public safety and human services committee meeting scheduled tomorrow morning at 9:30 A.M.,73,,
412,0.97,2670.367,2673.47,The agenda has briefings scheduled for 3:00.,73,,
413,0.97,2673.47,2679.576,The first is the December 9 emergency 911 system outage.,73,,
414,0.97,2679.576,2689.82,Folks might remember in early December there was a regional 911 system outage that had impacts throughout the region.,73,,
415,0.97,2689.82,2697.227,So we will be joined by director Lombard at the community safety and communication center to learn more about that.,73,,
416,0.97,2697.227,2706.67,And we are also going to be receiving an update from public health on the latest on Covid-19.,73,,
417,0.97,2706.67,2718.882,"And finally we're going to be receiving a briefing from the director of police Accountabilityon his findings about the proud boy used by SPD on June 8, 2020.",73,,
418,0.97,2718.882,2727.591,We will also be joined in that briefing by senior deputy Mayor Harrell and the community.,73,,
419,0.97,2727.591,2733.864,There is a possibility that one of these items may need to be rescheduled because of the family health emergency.,73,,
420,0.97,2733.864,2737.434,If so my office would advise as soon as possible.,73,,
421,0.97,2737.434,2746.176,I know there is as it relates to in particular to the third item there is a significant interest in that item.,73,,
422,0.97,2746.176,2759.857,So I just want to let folks know now even if you're not on the public safety committee you are welcomed to attend for this item or any item that we were hearing tomorrow morning.,73,,
423,0.97,2759.857,2775.839,"And all of the briefing, there are some time limits on the time slots when Presenters are available for the meeting, so we will need to stick to the schedule allotted the amount of time for each of these items as much as possible.",73,,
424,0.97,2775.839,2784.081,And just want to talk a little bit about that third item on the agenda related to the O.P.,73,,
425,0.97,2784.081,2784.414,Investigation.,73,,
426,0.97,2784.414,2794.458,I did express my concern last week that there were no management action recommendations from OPA on this investigation.,73,,
427,0.97,2794.458,2808.906,I did ask OPA to reissue the not fully completed by SPD management action recommendations associated with a 2019 investigation from OPA.,73,,
428,0.97,2808.906,2821.285,"Again, that was an investigation that OPA found sustained findings and also issued management recommendations that have not yet been completely fulfilled.",73,,
429,0.97,2821.285,2842.072,I also ask OPA why they made no recommendations related to the documentation of the OPA did as part of their report identify as a problem that there was no documentation.,73,,
430,0.97,2842.072,2846.109,But they made no management action recommendations.,73,,
431,0.97,2846.109,2853.984,Management recommendations is when OPA finds a gap in the policy that led to a finding.,73,,
432,0.97,2853.984,2860.424,In this case the OPA despite the fact they identified that there was a problem with the lack of documentation.,73,,
433,0.97,2860.424,2872.936,They did not make a recommendation for a new policy requiring documentation on the use of a ruse.,73,,
434,0.97,2872.936,2878.075,It's really hard to do oversight on that police action.,73,,
435,0.97,2878.075,2893.657,"In the case of this ruse as well as the 2019 ruse, the fact there was a ruse at all came to light in the public not because of any documentation from SPD, but because of inquiries that were made by members of the public.",73,,
436,0.97,2893.657,2899.863,In one case and members of the media in another.,73,,
437,0.97,2899.863,2908.872,So then some have asked whether or not this investigation was sufficient.,73,,
438,0.97,2908.872,2911.008,The sufficiency of the investigation is one element.,73,,
439,0.97,2911.008,2921.151,"Whether or not their findings associated with that investigation is another element, but I know there are concerns the investigation itself was not sufficient.",73,,
440,0.97,2921.151,2929.526,And so I have asked office of Inspector General whose job it is to certify sufficiency of an investigation.,73,,
441,0.97,2929.526,2945.676,"I have asked them to provide some more detailed information related to their certification of this particular investigation as thorough, timely, in which they have done as it relates to this particular investigation.",73,,
442,0.97,2945.676,2953.817,I think as most people know Ruses are legal under state law.,73,,
443,0.97,2953.817,2962.292,Spd policies allow these tactics to be used in limited circumstances.,73,,
444,0.97,2962.292,3012.542,"Nevertheless Oig is working--office Inspector General is working to ensure SPD policy changes actually addresses the concerns raised by these cases, and they are also raising the question of whether Washington state law making Ruses legal whether or not it is from the Oig, ""a renewed look at their efficacy is needed given the need to build and maintain legitimacy with community in a negative impact and any form could have on public trust ."" also the office of the inspector general's sentinel review panel is planned to include the use of the ruse in their upcoming third wave sentinel review report as a reminder.",73,,
445,0.97,3012.542,3025.822,"We've only so far done--Oig has only so far done week one report of the sentinel review, which covers only the events of four days, may 29 through June 1.",73,,
446,0.97,3025.822,3032.996,That one report covering those four days resulted in 50 more than recommendations.,73,,
447,0.97,3032.996,3035.766,We are expecting the report to be out soon.,73,,
448,0.97,3035.766,3041.905,As I mentioned we will have three reviews and reports.,73,,
449,0.97,3041.905,3044.508,It has been planned to cover the ruse.,73,,
450,0.97,3044.508,3058.054,One of the bigger picture issues regarding the use of the proud boys as part of the ruse at that moment RAISES questions of how together with the abandonment of the East precinct.,73,,
451,0.97,3058.054,3062.225,How these events contributed to the conditions.,73,,
452,0.97,3062.225,3077.074,It was reasonably foreseeable to believe that the demonstrators would be afraid and concerned that the proud boys some of whom were said to be open carrying would come to the Chaz/Chop.,73,,
453,0.97,3077.074,3093.89,I do--I've confirmed my recollection that after hearing concerns from constituents that night of June 8 that I did reach out to the chief about this and contacted her about the concerns.,73,,
454,0.97,3093.89,3108.271,"Not that there was a ruse, but the proud boys were gathering in Seattle and was at that time told that I should be more skeptical about what I hear in the media.",73,,
455,0.97,3108.271,3111.741,Moving on to some short updates on the human services Department.,73,,
456,0.97,3111.741,3127.524,I want to let folks know on January 7 the aging and disabilities staff from Hsd participated in a Dementia collaborative focus group interview with a doctorate of nurse practitioner student.,73,,

487,0.97,3346.609,3349.479,Questions or comments about my report?,73,,
488,0.97,3349.479,3352.048,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",74,,
489,0.97,3352.048,3361.658,"Again, you have been on the--working with Opi, Oig, and the accountability partners for as long as I have been on Council.",74,,
490,0.97,3361.658,3363.993,"Thank you, and you always know about stuff and then some.",74,,
491,0.97,3363.993,3375.472,One of the questions and concerns that I had a chance to look at what you were reciting on the ruse investigations that we know are finding their roots in legality and state law.,74,,
492,0.97,3375.472,3391.254,Are we going to learn tomorrow where we find the legality and how--how that works under Seattle municipal code or city law that you can do these ruse investigations?,74,,
493,0.97,3391.254,3391.788,The city allows it.,74,,
494,0.97,3391.788,3402.532,Are we going to learn more from OPA how that works and what the Timeline is going to be and what the results will be?,74,,
495,0.97,3402.532,3412.108,"So to my knowledge there isn't a law, but there is a police Department policy related to Ruses.",75,,
496,0.97,3412.108,3414.077,That's consistent with state law.,75,,
497,0.97,3414.077,3417.414,And when OPA does an investigation there's been a violation of policy.,75,,
498,0.97,3417.414,3427.757,They look at the existing policy and try to make a determination of whether or not the police actions that have occurred or are consistent with existing policy.,75,,
499,0.97,3427.757,3438.668,Even in those cases where an investigation finds there's been consistency with existing policy often they'll make recommendations for changes in that policy.,75,,
500,0.97,3438.668,3445.341,"So yes, you may have adhered to the policy, but the policy isn't good enough.",75,,
501,0.97,3445.341,3449.979,That's when I referred to a management action recommendation.,75,,
502,0.97,3449.979,3456.452,That's when the OPA is asking SPD to make a change in their policy.,75,,
503,0.97,3456.452,3483.112,"And in this case for this particular investigation there were sustained findings meaning they found that officers did not, did not carry out an action that was a legal action to carry out, but they did not follow the policy that defines how they are suppose to carry out that action.",75,,
504,0.97,3483.112,3486.483,And the OPA investigation also found there were no Documentations of the ruse.,75,,
505,0.97,3486.483,3490.019,No requirement for Ruses to be documented at all.,75,,
506,0.97,3490.019,3498.061,And so that is when I said that I was disappointed there was no management action recommendation.,75,,
507,0.97,3498.061,3516.579,"I was reflecting on the fact that I have asked the OPA director, and I raised this also with chief Diaz that if Ruses are going to be continued to be allowed in Seattle there should be a policy that requires they be reported.",75,,
508,0.97,3516.579,3526.556,So that we don't find out through an accident of either the media looking into an issue or another member of the public looking into an issue.,75,,
509,0.97,3526.556,3535.265,We don't find out by accident that a ruse has occurred and then that coincidence leads to the investigation.,75,,
510,0.97,3535.265,3543.773,It should be the fact that there is just like they do with uses of force for uses of force.,75,,
511,0.97,3543.773,3546.543,You have to report uses of force.,75,,
512,0.97,3546.543,3550.747,"If there is a firearms discharge, you have to report Firearm discharge.",75,,
513,0.97,3550.747,3560.857,And so there is a reporting process whenever something occurs and then you can easily review whether or not the action is consistent with the policy.,75,,
514,0.97,3560.857,3564.127,"That's very difficult, if not, impossible right now to do with Ruses.",75,,
515,0.97,3564.127,3567.563,"Right, and we found out through someone in the media.",76,,
516,0.97,3567.563,3572.869,"They did a reference well over four, five months ago and then it finally came out.",76,,
517,0.97,3572.869,3573.069,Okay.,76,,
518,0.97,3573.069,3577.974,"Yeah, Okay, I guess we'll learn more tomorrow morning.",76,,
519,0.97,3577.974,3578.174,Okay.,76,,
520,0.97,3578.174,3578.608,Thank you so much.,76,,
521,0.97,3578.608,3579.943,I will just go ahead.,76,,
522,0.97,3579.943,3590.019,Anyone that wants to ask Council member Herbold anymore questions?,76,,
523,0.97,3590.019,3590.219,Okay.,76,,
524,0.97,3590.219,3591.554,I do not see none.,76,,
525,0.97,3591.554,3594.557,I will passenger it on to Council President Juarez.,76,,
526,0.97,3594.557,3596.359,Thank you Council member Herbold.,77,,
527,0.97,3596.359,3603.566,"So before we adjourn, let me say a few words about as you know how we're going to do Council briefings on Mondays at 2:00.",77,,
528,0.97,3603.566,3605.902,And I appreciate all of you being so flexible.,77,,
529,0.97,3605.902,3617.146,I know I talked to you about how we really want to have more conversations for you to talk to each other and ask each other questions.,77,,
530,0.97,3617.146,3625.054,We will have our Seattle city council meetings tomorrow at 2:00 and go back to our rules of orders and all the things we need to do.,77,,
531,0.97,3625.054,3636.866,"My understanding is on the 17th, which is a Monday, we will all be celebrating Martin Luther King day, so we will not have Briefs on Monday, but we will be back on the 18th.",77,,
532,0.97,3636.866,3642.071,"Tomorrow, of course, we'll have Council member meetings at 2:00.",77,,
533,0.97,3642.071,3642.572,So let's see.,77,,
534,0.97,3642.572,3655.852,One reason why I'm kind of--and this is still a work in progress is that I really want to thank first of all our clerks and our I.T.,77,,
535,0.97,3655.852,3658.354,Department that work behind the scenes.,77,,
536,0.97,3658.354,3660.69,Also all of your staff and central staff.,77,,
537,0.97,3660.69,3680.109,"What I think I learned and we could all say this almost coming up since the start of the pandemic, I'm really trying to limit your time of staring at a computer for four to six hours because you have other committees, external committees, other things you have to do, you have to meet with constituents.",77,,
538,0.97,3680.109,3682.945,"I'm really concerned about people's mental health, their physical health.",77,,
539,0.97,3682.945,3689.452,"I just don't want you to be Chained to a screen, you know, four, five, six, seven hours.",77,,
540,0.97,3689.452,3690.62,It's not good for anybody.,77,,
541,0.97,3690.62,3699.195,"So I'm going to ask that we all try to be mindful of everybody's health and their time and Council briefings are just that, council briefings.",77,,
542,0.97,3699.195,3707.704,"I'd like to know what you did last night, what you're doing next week, what proclamations you have Teed up, what letters you think we need to know about.",77,,
543,0.97,3707.704,3717.513,I know I talked to Council member Strauss earlier today about talking and working more with the Seattle channel to give you more of a platform if there are more issues that you want to expand upon.,77,,
544,0.97,3717.513,3720.416,I know some of you have newsletters.,77,,
545,0.97,3720.416,3726.789,I'm also going to encourage some of you to do Video news letters.,77,,
546,0.97,3726.789,3727.19,Those are great.,77,,
547,0.97,3727.19,3728.558,And our constituents love them.,77,,
548,0.97,3728.558,3736.499,"This is a quick little hot, not just hot takes on what's going on, but giving community members an opportunity to speak for two minutes about what's going on.",77,,
549,0.97,3736.499,3746.142,"I usually talk for a minute and then I hand it over to people in the community that will talk about what's going on in our community center, our food Bank, our clinic, you know, children's home society.",77,,
550,0.97,3746.142,3751.848,And so that's what I'm hoping we do.,77,,
551,0.97,3751.848,3757.553,As we move forward as you know I would like to just kind of keep things on track and move forward.,77,,
552,0.97,3757.553,3760.656,So with that I don't think there is anything else to add.,77,,
553,0.97,3760.656,3769.632,"I will see you all tomorrow at 2:00, and with that we are adjourned.",77,,
554,0.97,3769.632,3769.899,Thank you.,77,,
