159,0.97,1102.534,1105.637,I just want to touch base about that.,24,,
160,0.97,1105.637,1108.04,I believe that is the case.,25,,

177,0.97,1186.318,1186.585,Okay.,32,,
178,0.97,1186.585,1186.818,Good.,32,,
179,0.97,1186.818,1187.052,Sorry.,32,,
180,0.97,1187.052,1191.023,"Calling in, I am never quite sure.",32,,
181,0.97,1191.023,1191.29,Any way.,32,,
182,0.97,1191.29,1191.49,Yes.,32,,
183,0.97,1191.49,1205.437,I am glad to share a couple of thoughts on behalf of Council President Gonzalez.,32,,
184,0.97,1205.437,1207.372,This is similar to what Washington State do.,32,,
185,0.97,1207.372,1221.82,It could be a good practice for the city as well given the division of powers between the executive and the Council and might foster a better active information to all parties.,32,,
186,0.97,1221.82,1228.527,Definitely something that I am considering looking into and learning more about.,32,,
187,0.97,1228.527,1231.563,And a lot of regional this is the practice.,32,,
188,0.97,1231.563,1236.234,"So, looking forward to diving into this more.",32,,
189,0.97,1236.234,1239.571,"Thank you very much, any questions on this?",33,,
190,0.97,1239.571,1240.973,Okay.,34,,
191,0.97,1240.973,1241.306,Thank you.,34,,
192,0.97,1241.306,1249.615,And thank you Council President Gonzalez for this item.,34,,
193,0.97,1249.615,1249.915,City light.,34,,
194,0.97,1249.915,1254.419,Let's keep going here.,34,,
195,0.97,1254.419,1256.255,Thank you very much Eric.,34,,
196,0.97,1256.255,1256.421,,35,,
197,0.97,1256.421,1258.39,There are two proposals here.,36,,
198,0.97,1258.39,1270.068,The first and both are from Councilmember Sawant.,36,,
199,0.97,1270.068,1271.436,Low income residents.,36,,
200,0.97,1271.436,1276.208,That was short and sweet.,37,,
201,0.97,1276.208,1277.309,"Thank you, Eric.",37,,
202,0.97,1277.309,1278.81,Sorry.,38,,
203,0.97,1278.81,1279.811,No problem.,39,,
204,0.97,1279.811,1280.512,"Councilmember Sawant, go ahead.",39,,
205,0.97,1280.512,1281.98,Thank you.,40,,
206,0.97,1281.98,1294.926,As we know Seattle has already suspended utility rate increases for everyone during the Covid-19 emergency.,40,,
207,0.97,1294.926,1297.396,And rent as well.,40,,
208,0.97,1297.396,1310.042,And the Council has been saying and all of the bills need to be canceled not just have moratorium and rate Increass to be installed.,40,,
209,0.97,1310.042,1318.75,Otherwise people will have huge bills that they will never be able to pay.,40,,
210,0.97,1318.75,1319.051,Impossible.,40,,
211,0.97,1319.051,1325.324,Demanding everyone who lost income due to the Covid-19 emergency have their rents canceled in the same way.,40,,
212,0.97,1325.324,1350.282,I think it is important that we also show that support for utility payments and that is why this budget amendment would address one part of that demand which is canceling utility bills for people who lost their livelihoods due to Covid-19 and with Seattle's being public it is the least we can do.,40,,
213,0.97,1350.282,1351.583,Thank you.,40,,
214,0.97,1351.583,1356.388,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Sawant.",41,,
215,0.97,1356.388,1358.59,Any questions on this one?,41,,
216,0.97,1358.59,1358.857,Okay.,41,,
217,0.97,1358.857,1370.702,"I would just ask a quick question, I know Sawant chair today and I have as well and now Councilmember Pedersen.",41,,
218,0.97,1370.702,1375.707,Are there any comments around the requirement in code for the city to try to collect payment?,41,,
219,0.97,1375.707,1383.815,I know it is very different than going after payment and collection which is we have opposed as well.,41,,
220,0.97,1383.815,1390.889,"So, as long as an attempt to, an attempt to get the payment done is that still a requirement or how would this work?",41,,
221,0.97,1390.889,1391.123,Yes.,42,,
222,0.97,1391.123,1394.126,I will try to answer a few parts of your questions.,42,,
223,0.97,1394.126,1404.836,"One is that yes, it is true, city light is not turning off anyone's power, they are not sending folks to collections, those sorts of things because of the status of the emergency and so on and so forth.",42,,
224,0.97,1404.836,1412.244,"In fact, city light right now is encouraging people who are having trouble paying bills to contact them to defer payments.",42,,
225,0.97,1412.244,1419.084,As you know there is an extension of the time when penalty for late payments is completely waived.,42,,
226,0.97,1419.084,1423.188,So that is the circumstance that we are in right now.,42,,
227,0.97,1423.188,1441.74,"Also, utility discount program and for all of the utilities for a person having trouble paying their bill and does not--is not participating in the discount program, they are encouraged to Self-Certify into that program.",42,,
228,0.97,1441.74,1443.775,That reduces it based on their income.,42,,
229,0.97,1443.775,1450.282,And city light and sale of public utilities is allowing folks to Self-Certify right now.,42,,
230,0.97,1450.282,1451.683,It speeds it up.,42,,
231,0.97,1451.683,1459.724,That is quickly where we are at under current circumstances.,42,,
232,0.97,1459.724,1463.728,"Canceling the bill, no payment, there would be a few things to explore on that.",42,,
233,0.97,1463.728,1472.904,"The way it works it allows for the utilities to provide for folks having trouble paying their bills, that is why we have it.",42,,
234,0.97,1472.904,1478.91,The proposal to have folks pay nothing at all would take more exploration.,42,,
235,0.97,1478.91,1485.317,If the Council is interested doing so I will take it up with utility and law and find out what the dimensions might be.,42,,
236,0.97,1485.317,1494.826,"I would be interested in that action, Councilmember Sawant thank you for out lining this issue.",43,,
237,0.97,1494.826,1513.011,For context as well many of the programs and changes in policy are needed and sort of Daylighted because of the audit that we had asked for at City light with auditor Jones now 1 1/2 years ago.,43,,
238,0.97,1513.011,1518.383,Many of the issues Predate Debra Smith and really appreciate that the changes have been put in place.,43,,
239,0.97,1518.383,1532.864,But for folks suffering with some of the other older policies these changes were much-needed and appreciated now during the Covid-19 crisis.,43,,
240,0.97,1532.864,1543.675,"As stated a desire that folks are not saddled a bill in the long run is important, too.",43,,
241,0.97,1543.675,1547.846,Councilmembers any other comments on this?,43,,
242,0.97,1547.846,1549.915,"Councilmember Sawant, please go ahead.",43,,
243,0.97,1549.915,1556.888,Just to make one more point in addition to Eric made.,44,,
244,0.97,1556.888,1580.812,We are talking about households that were not enrolled presumably before the pandemic they were making enough income to pay their bills under sort of that eligibility for the discount and I think there is nothing wrong in saying to households to Self-Certify.,44,,
245,0.97,1580.812,1593.258,I just want to remind the Council we made a big effort to turn the utility into an opt out rather than an opt in.,44,,
246,0.97,1593.258,1597.629,It shows it ends up in lower eligibility.,44,,
247,0.97,1597.629,1599.798,Just a mathematical thing.,44,,
248,0.97,1599.798,1611.676,"If the city can afford to do, extend the utility discount and reduce them by 16% we might as well go all of the way and reduce the bill by 100%.",44,,
249,0.97,1611.676,1611.943,Okay.,45,,
250,0.97,1611.943,1612.444,Thank you very much.,45,,
251,0.97,1612.444,1622.22,And the next one I see is also Councilmember Sawant with city light.,46,,
252,0.97,1622.22,1622.42,Eric?,46,,
253,0.97,1622.42,1622.687,Sure.,47,,
254,0.97,1622.687,1627.726,This proposal would add appropriation to city light for energy conservation programs.,47,,
255,0.97,1631.896,1634.366,Councilmember Sawant?,48,,
256,0.97,1634.366,1652.35,"In the Mayor's proposed 2021 budget her media statements about it she has highlighted the small city light funds dedicated to transportation, Electrication.",49,,
257,0.97,1652.35,1659.924,"Any way, of course, even as small as it is it is an investment my office is extremely supportive of.",49,,
258,0.97,1659.924,1680.512,The Mayor's office failed to mention these are not new investments and when you look at the whole package of city lights climate funding including transformation and conservation programs the Mayor has actually proposed reducing the funding for green program in the next.,49,,
259,0.97,1680.512,1684.482,This amendment is intended to restore those cut funds.,49,,
260,0.97,1684.482,1704.769,"We are attempting to identify exactly how much has been cut but this is complicated because of the many funds that were moved around into different budgets, summary levels.",49,,
261,0.97,1704.769,1707.972,"Thank you very much, any questions on this item?",49,,
262,0.97,1707.972,1711.643,Not seeing any.,49,,
263,0.97,1711.643,1711.843,Okay.,49,,
264,0.97,1711.843,1716.514,"Thank you very much Councilmember Sawant, thank you, Eric.",49,,
265,0.97,1716.514,1719.15,Let's move on to office for civil rights.,49,,
266,0.97,1719.15,1723.588,For those following along on the memo I am on page 21.,50,,
267,0.97,1723.588,1746.644,The proposal is to create and add funds to staff and indigenous Fund and relevant to urban populations and how the city can serve that population.,50,,
268,0.97,1746.644,1754.886,Sponsored by Councilmember Juarez.,50,,
269,0.97,1754.886,1756.054,"Wonderful, Councilmember Juarez.",51,,
270,0.97,1756.054,1757.255,"Yes, I would like two minutes.",52,,
271,0.97,1757.255,1758.289,I will start the Timer.,53,,
272,0.97,1758.289,1758.823,[Laughter],53,,
273,0.97,1758.823,1771.302,"The important purpose of providing direction, guidance and subject matter expertise to advice Seattle elected officials and city departments on issues pertaining to urban native populations as well as tribal issues.",54,,
274,0.97,1771.302,1783.381,As you know we added native communities to our city council committee structure in 2018 and it has been quite successful.,54,,
275,0.97,1783.381,1794.526,"The indigenous Council will work with other city Councilmembers, the executives, city Department to coordinate overall policy development.",54,,
276,0.97,1794.526,1805.937,The indigenous Council will not duplicate the work that advocates for funding services.,54,,
277,0.97,1805.937,1816.247,"I envision community leaders, professionals, tribal Council elected officials to bring forward indigenous knowledge and profession and skills to the table that we need today.",54,,
278,0.97,1816.247,1820.084,This is also happening I should add on the Federal level as well.,54,,
279,0.97,1820.084,1823.688,Just a quick background on data.,54,,
280,0.97,1823.688,1830.261,"Today, 71% of American Indians and Alaska natives live in urban settings.",54,,
281,0.97,1830.261,1838.269,Urban Indians over often an overlooked members in the society even though they represent the population.,54,,
282,0.97,1838.269,1848.446,"American Indians and Alaska natives experience Disperportions higher rates of violence, homelessness, health disparities, chronic disease, racism and poverty.",54,,
283,0.97,1848.446,1852.283,We have an opportunity to shape the future of native individuals and families.,54,,
284,0.97,1852.283,1855.787,Currently we have a gap to fill.,54,,
285,0.97,1855.787,1865.763,Other cities have successfully created a position similarly--similar like the indigenous advisory committee.,54,,
286,0.97,1865.763,1877.442,"Portland has a director to assist the city Council, the executives and all city departments in strengthening relationships and coordinating overall policy development with tribal government in the Portland area.",54,,
287,0.97,1877.442,1879.244,I hope we can do the same here.,54,,
288,0.97,1879.244,1900.632,"We have this opportunity to not only strengthen policy priorities that impact native communities but also to build positive relationships with our indigenous people and local and regional tribal governments and that includes working with them, not only on services but leverage of State and Federal dollars.",54,,
289,0.97,1900.632,1911.876,This item would utilize funds to fund a .5 FCC or one full time or one.,54,,
290,0.97,1911.876,1919.417,-- assess the appropriate location for the indigenous advisory Council.,54,,
291,0.97,1919.417,1923.154,Some of the options might be civil rights.,54,,
292,0.97,1923.154,1929.46,"In any event, central staff, you guys have been great.",54,,
293,0.97,1929.46,1929.794,Thank you.,54,,
294,0.97,1929.794,1932.163,Excellent.,55,,

299,0.97,1943.074,1950.782,"I know you are still looking into the total dollar amount Tbd at this point, is that correct?",55,,
300,0.97,1950.782,1951.115,Yes.,56,,
301,0.97,1951.115,1964.262,"And I just want to say, I just want to say a big thank you to my colleagues back in '18 and recently and the successes we have in folding native communities into our city council structure.",56,,
302,0.97,1964.262,1966.931,I don't know any of other has done that.,56,,
303,0.97,1966.931,1971.569,The Legislature has done it a few years back with Senator McCoy.,56,,
304,0.97,1971.569,1974.906,I am hoping to duplicate that and have the same success.,56,,
305,0.97,1974.906,1976.708,"So, thank you.",56,,
306,0.97,1976.708,1981.012,Excellent point.,57,,

316,0.97,2026.09,2043.474,They are taking good steps to address this backlog in this statement will help us identify additional opportunities to review permanent review times and ask them to report quarterly to the Committee on the review times and progress and addressing there backlog.,59,,
317,0.97,2043.474,2047.478,I have worked with the director on this issue throughout this year.,59,,

319,0.97,2048.012,2057.255,I know he is putting in the appropriate effort and that he is making good progress on this effort.,59,,
320,0.97,2057.255,2066.764,And this would help us ensure that that reporting would come to this Committee on a quarterly basis.,59,,

329,0.97,2115.179,2134.966,Not so different when Seattle city light had a backlog in their billing a number of years ago and we watched as Seattle city light made immense efforts and put immense resources behind reducing the bag--backlog and I see a similar thing here.,61,,

349,0.97,2242.073,2254.185,And that position authority for that electrical Inspector just remind the Councilmembers that Inspector would perform a body of work that is currently performed by labor and industries.,68,,
350,0.97,2254.185,2262.093,When that position on authority is still there and the intention is to fill it in 2022.,68,,
351,0.97,2262.093,2262.627,All right.,69,,
352,0.97,2262.627,2266.897,"It was not cut but not fill inside the last year, right?",69,,
353,0.97,2266.897,2268.966,Correct.,70,,
354,0.97,2268.966,2269.367,Okay.,71,,
355,0.97,2269.367,2273.404,Thanks so much Councilmember Strauss getting our Inspector positions there.,71,,
356,0.97,2273.404,2276.54,Thank you for putting it forward.,71,,
357,0.97,2276.54,2276.907,Any questions?,71,,
358,0.97,2276.907,2283.18,"Great, let's go on to the next item.",71,,
359,0.97,2283.18,2300.865,"The next it is from Councilmember Strauss to increase funding, amount to be determined in anticipation of increased demand related to Covid-19.",72,,
360,0.97,2300.865,2302.733,"Eviction moratoriums, Eviction --",72,,
361,0.97,2302.733,2313.411,Excellent and for folks following along more information than seen on the slide is provided here we are on page 22 now on the memo.,73,,
362,0.97,2313.411,2314.178,"Councilmember Strauss, go ahead.",73,,
363,0.97,2314.178,2317.148,Thank you very much.,74,,
364,0.97,2317.148,2329.46,Similar to the last proposal it recognizes the Covid-19 and the rise in Evictions we may see as the Eviction moratoriums and government support disappear over the course of time.,74,,
365,0.97,2329.46,2337.034,"It Heightens the need for tenant protections and out reach contracts that is why I am bringing this proposal forward, thank you, chair.",74,,
366,0.97,2337.034,2339.737,Thank you very much.,75,,
367,0.97,2339.737,2343.174,Are there questions on this item?,75,,
368,0.97,2343.174,2344.909,Councilmember Sawant please go ahead.,75,,
369,0.97,2344.909,2365.396,Not so much a question just wanted to add I have a proposal coming up that is similar and I wanted to let Councilmember Strauss know my staff will reach out to your office to see--it is--it is in the same spirit.,76,,
370,0.97,2365.396,2370.768,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Sawant.",77,,
371,0.97,2370.768,2377.074,"Okay, Councilmember Strauss I am not seeing any questions, let's go to number 4.",77,,
372,0.97,2377.074,2386.35,Increasing funding and position authority for additional protection and staff including Arborists.,78,,
373,0.97,2386.35,2386.717,Wonderful.,79,,
374,0.97,2386.717,2390.855,And we spoke about trees a little bit this morning.,79,,
375,0.97,2390.855,2394.091,Would you like to provide more context on this one?,79,,
376,0.97,2394.091,2396.093,Thank you.,80,,
377,0.97,2396.093,2404.735,As I noted earlier my office continues to work with Sdci on a number of strategies to improve tree protection in our city.,80,,
378,0.97,2404.735,2414.545,As we work on those strategies I continue to see that too often we don't have the capacity to fully enforce the tree laws that are already on the books.,80,,
379,0.97,2414.545,2419.25,Sometimes because an Inspector cannot make it to a site before a tree is removed.,80,,
380,0.97,2419.25,2429.827,"This proposal would increase the funding for the team of Arborists and inspectors so they can respond factor and prevent violations before they occur, thank you, chair.",80,,
381,0.97,2429.827,2431.729,"Excellent, thank you.",81,,
382,0.97,2431.729,2437.201,I am not seeing anyone with their hand raised.,81,,
383,0.97,2437.201,2440.805,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Strauss.",81,,
384,0.97,2440.805,2441.705,Continuing with our tree them.,81,,
385,0.97,2441.705,2444.141,Let's go to the next one.,81,,
386,0.97,2444.141,2457.688,Moving on to proposals for Kroupbsil proposals--Councilmember Pedersen.,82,,
387,0.97,2457.688,2469.767,"Cooperation and support, it will be released when the tree protection bill contemplated is submitted to the Council.",82,,
388,0.97,2469.767,2470.868,Excellent.,83,,
389,0.97,2470.868,2472.203,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",83,,
390,0.97,2472.203,2474.271,Thank you.,84,,
391,0.97,2474.271,2491.222,"As we talked about this morning older, larger trees have incredible environmental and social justice benefits and the city Council has been trying to work with the executive to update and strengthen the city's tree ordinance for many years.",84,,
392,0.97,2491.222,2502.733,"And, this will help to improve the quality of life as well as our environment and to provide and retain health benefits for all communities.",84,,
393,0.97,2502.733,2517.648,The Council adopted resolution in 2019.,84,,
394,0.97,2517.648,2530.427,"This would encourage them to Prioritize their work in 2021 as originally, you know, because we want it sooner rather than later.",84,,
395,0.97,2530.427,2540.538,"So, provide funding from that budget summary line item so they would deliver the ordinance.",84,,
396,0.97,2540.538,2543.774,Thank you very much.,85,,
397,0.97,2543.774,2546.01,I see a hand.,85,,
398,0.97,2546.01,2550.648,Thank you very much Councilmember Strauss.,85,,
399,0.97,2550.648,2556.086,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen I want to applaud you for all of the work.,86,,
400,0.97,2556.086,2565.529,"We discussed some of the variables in this and the other proposals and I signal that I look forward to continue to work with you on these, thank you.",86,,
401,0.97,2565.529,2565.93,Thank you.,87,,
402,0.97,2569.3,2569.8,All right.,88,,
403,0.97,2569.8,2572.369,With that let's go to the next one.,88,,
404,0.97,2572.369,2572.803,Sorry.,89,,
405,0.97,2572.803,2578.108,Moving on to the next proposal from Councilmember Pedersen.,90,,
406,0.97,2578.108,2580.044,Item number 6 on page 22.,90,,
407,0.97,2580.044,2595.092,"There would add $250,000 to Sdci where it will be placed remains to be determined to develop and implement a displacement monitoring program.",90,,
408,0.97,2595.092,2601.131,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Pedersen.",91,,
409,0.97,2601.131,2601.732,Thank you.,92,,
410,0.97,2601.732,2605.169,I know we support additional affordable housing throughout Seattle.,92,,
411,0.97,2605.169,2611.308,While we support new construction we want to make sure we have a net gain in the amount of affordable housing.,92,,
412,0.97,2611.308,2627.524,When adopting major land use changes to support the creation of affordable housing the potential loss or demolition of existing naturally occurring affordable housing and the displacement of low income households has not been quantified or mitigated.,92,,
413,0.97,2627.524,2637.201,The same issue comes up every time a permit is granted for construction of new buildings that may result in the demolition of existing residential buildings.,92,,
414,0.97,2637.201,2652.182,The Council attempted to rectify this program in a resolution that asks the executive to implement data and recording on the status and trends.,92,,
415,0.97,2652.182,2660.19,"So, how much new, how much is new construction leading to affordable housing and the displacement of low and moderate income residents.",92,,
416,0.97,2660.19,2661.659,What are the net impacts?,92,,
417,0.97,2661.659,2680.811,This more detailed data is needed to get the facts and if warranted to consider potential course corrections or mitigation in city policy to better achieve our goals the net increase in affordable housing and economic integration less displacement.,92,,
418,0.97,2680.811,2682.279,Thank you.,92,,
419,0.97,2682.279,2685.149,Thank you very much Councilmember Pedersen.,93,,
420,0.97,2685.149,2686.483,Any questions on this one?,93,,
421,0.97,2686.483,2686.684,Okay.,93,,
422,0.97,2686.684,2690.387,Just a quick question on my end.,93,,
423,0.97,2690.387,2698.962,"I see it would include rent levels, vacancy rates and Demolitions, affordable housing units.",93,,
424,0.97,2698.962,2711.208,I am wondering if it is also considering demolition but also replacement with X number of units so there is that balance.,93,,
425,0.97,2711.208,2719.116,Like single-family home was torn down but 6-8 apartment units created are you doing that analysis as well?,93,,
426,0.97,2719.116,2719.616,Absolutely.,94,,
427,0.97,2719.616,2719.817,Yes.,94,,
428,0.97,2719.817,2721.318,This would be the net impact.,94,,
429,0.97,2721.318,2740.838,"Not only would we compare the quantity of units after the new construction counting the newly constructed units and look at the Affordability of the units vs what might have been demolished and, that way we have a better picture of what is truly going on.",94,,
430,0.97,2740.838,2743.841,"Right now the data is very high- level, census data.",94,,
431,0.97,2743.841,2752.716,"Does not drill down to each residential building like it could easily, I believe.",94,,
432,0.97,2752.716,2766.363,Thank you very much Councilmember Pedersen.,95,,
433,0.97,2766.363,2781.211,"Again, this relates to after implementation and monitoring of the mandatory housing Affordability and program this would request a report by January 31st of 2021 on payment vs performance under the Mhar program.",96,,
434,0.97,2781.211,2791.021,The reporting is consistent with the requirements and the framework ordinance 125128.,96,,
435,0.97,2791.021,2792.389,Councilmember Pedersen please go ahead.,97,,
436,0.97,2792.389,2793.724,"Thank you, chair.",98,,
437,0.97,2793.724,2816.213,As many of you know the framework for the Affordability program adopted an ordinance 125108 requires them to have low income housing in their projects or pay a fee to the city's office of housing to contribute to construction of affordable housing years later.,98,,
438,0.97,2816.213,2824.822,That ordinance SETS policy on the balance between Onsite performance.,98,,
439,0.97,2824.822,2828.926,Council will consider raising payment amounts to avoid a bias towards payment.,98,,
440,0.97,2828.926,2836.033,We are striving for a balance of 50/50 of building on site vs writing a check.,98,,
441,0.97,2836.033,2849.947,"So, building on site implements important social justice principals such as building the affordable housing immediately instead of years later, and, integrating the affordable housing within each neighborhood instead of concentrating it elsewhere.",98,,
442,0.97,2849.947,2864.061,"So, while the current status of that is supposed to be reported annually by the office of housing it is better that we see the data frequently and we incorporate data from the Seattle Department of construction and inspection.",98,,
443,0.97,2864.061,2868.465,Developers indicate their choice when they apply for permits.,98,,
444,0.97,2868.465,2878.275,This item requests that they produce the data to confirm clearly one way or the other are we meeting the 50% goal or not.,98,,
445,0.97,2878.275,2883.58,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Pedersen.",99,,
446,0.97,2883.58,2884.915,Are their questions on this item?,99,,
447,0.97,2884.915,2902.199,The question that I would have is how does this differ from the existing requirements that were included to analyze the payment performance measures that are--that I believed were already on statue.,99,,
448,0.97,2902.199,2904.501,"So, it is similar.",100,,
449,0.97,2904.501,2917.447,Currently the Council receives a report every March from the office of housing that details payment vs performance under the mandatory housing Affordability program.,100,,
450,0.97,2917.447,2930.794,Councilmember Peterson just described a nuance that is not include inside that report that is what they intend to provide when applying for the permit.,100,,
451,0.97,2930.794,2932.496,It is not included.,100,,
452,0.97,2932.496,2936.633,It looks at just Actuals after the project has been developed.,100,,
453,0.97,2936.633,2942.639,That say distinction that is different from what our report is from March.,100,,
454,0.97,2942.639,2945.876,"Great, thank you.",101,,
455,0.97,2945.876,2953.083,Am I reading it correctly it would be--there is no dollar amount associated with this.,101,,
456,0.97,2953.083,2956.119,It would be adding the requirement in?,101,,
457,0.97,2956.119,2956.453,Correct.,102,,
458,0.97,2956.453,2957.154,Okay.,103,,
459,0.97,2957.154,2962.326,Thank you very much Councilmember Pedersen.,104,,
460,0.97,2962.326,2964.194,"Yes, correct.",105,,
461,0.97,2964.194,2965.228,Excellent.,106,,
462,0.97,2965.228,2965.429,Law.,106,,
463,0.97,2965.429,2971.902,"I am seeing no additional hands on this, thank you Councilmember Pedersen.",106,,
464,0.97,2971.902,2974.304,"Okay, let's move on to number 8.",106,,
465,0.97,2974.304,2978.275,The next four proposals are from Councilmember Sawant.,107,,
466,0.97,2978.275,2996.126,"The first is in the nature of a slide, requesting that they design an administrative structure and provide a cost estimate for the city to maintain transferable rental history background data base.",107,,
467,0.97,2996.126,2998.795,"Councilmember Sawant, please go ahead.",108,,
468,0.97,2998.795,3014.978,The statement of legislative request that Seattle Department of construction and inspections design an administrative structure and estimate associate costs for the city to maintain transferable rental history background reports.,109,,
469,0.97,3014.978,3029.359,The intention is to do the planning that will allow the Sustainability in Renters community to draft and pass an ordinance creating a structure to allow the rental history of tenants to be transferable from one landlord to the next.,109,,
470,0.97,3029.359,3037.267,It will allow for perspective tenants that paid for a background check to Reuse the results for each house or apartment that they apply to as well.,109,,
471,0.97,3037.267,3050.147,Allow the city to set policy for what is and is not acceptable.,109,,
472,0.97,3050.147,3053.483,For example.,109,,
473,0.97,3053.483,3062.692,Renters should be able to appeal the information to be sent to new rentals.,109,,
474,0.97,3062.692,3072.702,It has been and around brought up by rental rights organizations.,109,,
475,0.97,3072.702,3079.409,"There are real administrative challenges to maintaining histories, it challenges, privacy concerns and others.",109,,
476,0.97,3079.409,3087.651,"So, this statement will ask them to think through how to address those challenges.",109,,
477,0.97,3087.651,3090.62,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",110,,
478,0.97,3090.62,3094.624,Any questions on this item?,110,,
479,0.97,3094.624,3095.092,Okay.,110,,
480,0.97,3095.092,3096.893,Councilmember Sawant I am not seeing any.,110,,
481,0.97,3096.893,3108.905,"Again, this is a request to sort of do that further evaluation, that next step?",110,,
482,0.97,3108.905,3111.007,Is that correct Councilmember Sawant.,110,,
483,0.97,3111.007,3111.241,Yes.,111,,
484,0.97,3111.241,3122.452,"To do it as a slide or Separately, regardless to pass such an ordinance the city would have to have a clear idea of how they would administer this program.",111,,
485,0.97,3122.452,3125.422,Thank you very much Councilmember Sawant.,112,,
486,0.97,3125.422,3141.872,"Okay, moving on to the next item, and folks feel free to ask any questions that you have, burning questions as to what questions may need to be addressed before their form B.S are completed.",112,,
487,0.97,3141.872,3147.677,The next proposal also from Councilmember Sawant.,113,,
488,0.97,3147.677,3157.087,Requests that Sdci work with the Renter's Commission to draft standard terms for residential leases.,113,,
489,0.97,3157.087,3157.32,Yes.,114,,
490,0.97,3157.32,3158.488,Go ahead Councilmember Sawant.,114,,
491,0.97,3158.488,3159.489,Thank you.,115,,
492,0.97,3159.489,3175.839,This statement request the Department of construction and inspections to work with Seattle Renter's Commission to draft standard terms appropriate for all residential rental increases with input from organizations representing Renters and landlords.,115,,
493,0.97,3175.839,3190.086,"In the last meeting, the Renters rights Committee, chaired by my office, we heard from Renters whose landlords prohibited them from displaying black lives matter symbols in their windows.",115,,
494,0.97,3190.086,3197.427,We just saw a huge number of such complaints from tenants this year during the justice for George Floyd movement.,115,,
495,0.97,3197.427,3212.175,There is just one of the many outrageous lease term Renters have to accept in their leases because of the overwhelmingly majority of Renters don't have the power over what is in their lease.,115,,
496,0.97,3212.175,3223.753,"The lease it is mutely agreed upon is a fiction, the balance of the power is in the favor of landlords and Cooperations.",115,,
497,0.97,3223.753,3231.928,So the intention of this is to prepare for future ordinance to require all rental leases to contain certain standard terms.,115,,
498,0.97,3231.928,3249.779,Obviously there will be other parts of the lease that will change from home to home but there will be some standard terms that will make up basic rights and responsibilities for Renters and landlords and brood community input to know what lease terms are and not just come up with the fly.,115,,
499,0.97,3249.779,3253.516,Needs to be studied and a lot of community input.,115,,
500,0.97,3253.516,3269.065,They request that the Renters Commission make those recommendations based on the feedback they receive.,115,,
501,0.97,3269.332,3269.499,.,115,,
502,0.97,3269.499,3277.107,Okay moving on to the next proposal from Councilmember Sawant.,116,,
503,0.97,3277.107,3290.587,"Adding $750,000 to contract with an organization to provide Eviction --",117,,
504,0.97,3290.587,3291.154,Should I go ahead?,118,,
505,0.97,3294.057,3294.457,"Sure, why not.",119,,
506,0.97,3294.457,3294.724,[Laughter],119,,
507,0.97,3300.864,3303.8,Did we lose Councilmember Mosqueda?,120,,
508,0.97,3303.8,3306.836,Let's take a vote.,121,,
509,0.97,3306.836,3309.939,[Laughter].,121,,
510,0.97,3309.939,3312.342,Is Councilmember Herbold on?,122,,
511,0.97,3312.342,3315.311,She is vice chair.,122,,
512,0.97,3315.311,3315.712,I am on.,123,,
513,0.97,3315.712,3329.092,[Laughter] it is better to wait.,123,,
514,0.97,3329.092,3331.828,Council chair just Texted she cannot get in.,124,,
515,0.97,3333.83,3342.372,"So, I suppose while we are working on that let's continue on with the presentations.",125,,
516,0.97,3342.372,3348.745,"We are, I believe, we are on 10 or 11?",125,,
517,0.97,3348.745,3351.748,We are on 10.,126,,
518,0.97,3351.748,3355.985,Councilmember Sawant was going to put more meat on the bones.,126,,
519,0.97,3355.985,3360.857,"Fantastic, meat on the bones, please.",127,,
520,0.97,3360.857,3361.524,Thank you.,128,,
521,0.97,3361.524,3362.192,[Laughter],128,,
522,0.97,3362.192,3380.877,"So this budget action would add $750,000 to the Seattle Department of construction and inspections to the contract with the Renters Eviction defense organization such as the housing justice project of the King County bar Association to provide free legal defense for any Renter facing Eviction in Seattle.",129,,
523,0.97,3380.877,3400.363,"If the Council supports this my office will also propose an associate ordinance for all Renters facing Eviction, this is increasingly something we are seeing as a demand from Renters throughout the nation in other cities as well.",129,,
524,0.97,3400.363,3405.802,"1200 Eviction court hearings, excuse me, court files in Seattle.",129,,
525,0.97,3405.802,3409.339,Not counting Unfiled Eviction or Preeviction notices.,129,,
526,0.97,3409.339,3422.652,"They estimate that $750,000 would fund an additional five attorneys and two Paralegals and be sufficient to provide the right to Council for Renters facing Eviction in Seattle.",129,,
527,0.97,3422.652,3438.334,Studies will show a wave of Evictions after the emergency moratoriums are lifted and in addition there will be an increase in the overall number of attendance due to the economic downturn and lost jobs and lost incomes.,129,,
528,0.97,3438.334,3461.958,"And, as Councilmember of people's budget movement was able to win the first city funding for the attorneys the Council supported that and the following year we increased that to two defense attorneys and housing justice project estimates 56% overall success rate has been had since 2019 in keeping tenants housed from up to 24% from two years ago.",129,,
529,0.97,3461.958,3481.01,This is not the only source of funds they have other sources of funds but together they will have a big impact and really Life-Changing difference for tenants not to have an Eviction on their record and having a trained attorney by their side in the court makes all of the difference as we know.,129,,
530,0.97,3481.01,3491.921,"So, this amendment would provide--make access to legal representation a right for Renters facing Eviction in Seattle.",129,,
531,0.97,3491.921,3493.79,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,130,,
532,0.97,3493.79,3494.858,"Madam chair, back to you.",130,,

543,0.97,3542.272,3549.345,I was going to say all of the difficulties with the Internet it is a good case for Broadband.,134,,
544,0.97,3549.345,3550.28,[Laughter],134,,
545,0.97,3550.28,3567.096,"So, this budget action would add $500,000 to the Sdci budget to increase funding for Renter rights organizations to support Renter right education and organizing.",135,,
546,0.97,3567.096,3573.803,Organizations like tenants Union in Washington State and Seattle--sorry --,135,,

549,0.97,3577.507,3577.874,Okay.,138,,
550,0.97,3577.874,3589.986,These organizations do essential work to help educated workers about their rights and also help organize buildings to bargain collectively especially against abusive landlords.,139,,
551,0.97,3589.986,3597.527,"They do heroic work, as we know, with insufficient resources and often running on their dedication.",139,,
552,0.97,3597.527,3611.874,"But given the Evictions that are expected over the next year in Seattle and around the country I think it is essential that we increase the funds as much as we can until this budget action would add $500,000 for that purpose.",139,,
553,0.97,3611.874,3614.177,Thank you very much.,140,,

558,0.97,3632.161,3638.267,I believe you mentioned the Renters right Commission is it an item that came directly from them as well?,141,,
559,0.97,3638.267,3666.996,"No, I mentioned the Renters Commission in connection with the studies that need to be done to have ordinances for the legal defense and also for the transferable rents and specifically for transferable rents and standard residential leases but I have no doubt that the Renters Commission, also, would support this.",142,,
560,0.97,3666.996,3690.119,But this specifically has come from the feedback we received with organizations that are on the ground and actually helping Renters and tenants and tenants Union and especially tenants Union but these are organizations that get phone calls every day from Renters that need help.,142,,
561,0.97,3690.119,3692.321,Thank you for that background.,143,,

576,0.97,3750.046,3764.06,It is my understanding that it is possible that some of the duties of this position are getting absorbed in some other way by the Department.,148,,
577,0.97,3764.06,3770.133,"So, while the personnel and the policies might be shifting the general service might be remaining.",148,,
578,0.97,3770.133,3782.311,"To Eer on the side of caution I kept it on while I worked with the Department and with night life advocates to see if that is N fact, the case.",148,,
579,0.97,3782.311,3807.703,"I think it is really critical as we come out of the Covid-19 downturn that has had a massive impact, obviously, on performance Venues and night life and on all sorts of things related to this really critical part of our cultural identity and economy that we have the resources in place to assist and help with that recovery.",148,,
580,0.97,3807.703,3813.743,If it is planned to be done in a different way I am certainly Amendable to that.,148,,
581,0.97,3813.743,3832.261,I want to make sure that those are ideas that have been negotiated in coordination with the boosters.,148,,

587,0.97,3850.58,3862.191,"I do understand the office of economic development is moving towards sort of a Brooder catch all, the creative industries.",150,,
588,0.97,3862.191,3882.979,"But I have long felt that the night life and film positions should be maintained in order to really focus on these--particularly as it relates to music a really, really important part of our economy here in Seattle.",150,,

601,0.97,3931.494,3941.57,"We know the working waterfront provides good, well-paid positions that do not require an individual to take on educational debt to be successful and support their family.",157,,
602,0.97,3941.57,3948.444,This program Aligns with the city's brood of the Maritime work and I believe it should be retained.,157,,

680,0.97,4368.097,4368.397,Thank you.,185,,
681,0.97,4368.397,4378.54,And I was going to let our vice Claire--vice chair know I am on unstable Internet.,185,,
682,0.97,4378.54,4380.175,Thank you for standing by.,185,,
683,0.97,4380.175,4384.179,It came back on.,185,,
684,0.97,4384.179,4385.314,Thank you very much Pedersen.,185,,
685,0.97,4385.314,4389.184,If I have any questions on what I missed I will give you a call.,185,,
686,0.97,4389.184,4394.289,Let's move on to the next subject here in front of us.,185,,
687,0.97,4394.289,4394.59,I see Ryan.,185,,
688,0.97,4394.59,4394.99,"Hello, Ryan.",185,,
689,0.97,4394.99,4397.159,Good afternoon Councilmembers.,186,,
690,0.97,4397.159,4403.499,"Next up, proposals related to the Department of education and early learning or deal.",186,,
691,0.97,4403.499,4407.836,It can be found on page 24.,186,,
692,0.97,4407.836,4412.741,The first proposal is to add funding to D.E.A.L.,186,,
693,0.97,4412.741,4421.15,For black girls and young women.,186,,
694,0.97,4421.15,4422.151,It comes from Councilmember Gonzalez.,186,,
695,0.97,4422.151,4428.49,Councilmember Lewis did you have anything you want to add?,187,,
696,0.97,4428.49,4431.794,Go ahead.,188,,
697,0.97,4431.794,4432.027,Sorry.,188,,
698,0.97,4432.027,4442.07,Sorry about that Councilmember Morales did you have something to ask?,189,,
699,0.97,4442.07,4445.574,She asked me to address this for her since she is out.,189,,
700,0.97,4445.574,4446.074,My apologize.,190,,
701,0.97,4446.074,4451.713,"I thought the first NOTE I got was from all of the items, that is helpful to note.",190,,
702,0.97,4451.713,4460.389,I will make sure to make that ask.,190,,
703,0.97,4460.389,4460.889,Councilmember Morales.,190,,
704,0.97,4460.889,4461.156,Sure.,191,,
705,0.97,4461.156,4471.099,We are both interest inside making sure that we are increasing our investments for black girls in the city.,191,,
706,0.97,4471.099,4472.234,"So, the proposal the form a.",191,,
707,0.97,4472.234,4509.938,"Would be one step in the city supporting additional programs for black girls similar to D.E.A.L .'s my brother's keeper programs, currently there are modest investments made through the levy that are through an academic lens with spin girls focusing on stem pathways and ""my sister's keeper ."" would like to see additional funding support for more identity programs for black girls.",191,,
708,0.97,4509.938,4513.175,Thank you very much.,192,,
709,0.97,4513.175,4517.579,Councilmember Morales anything on that for yourself?,192,,
710,0.97,4517.579,4521.617,"On this no, thank you.",193,,
711,0.97,4521.617,4521.884,Okay.,194,,
712,0.97,4521.884,4523.018,Great let's continue.,194,,
713,0.97,4523.018,4524.219,Okay.,195,,
714,0.97,4524.219,4524.62,Thank you.,195,,
715,0.97,4524.62,4541.603,The second proposal comes from Councilmember Morales and title should read investment for black girls and young women.,195,,
716,0.97,4541.603,4546.375,How and if they are.,195,,
717,0.97,4546.375,4550.979,-- [Indiscernible]--D.E.A.L.,195,,
718,0.97,4550.979,4559.321,Would be requested for the one- time funds and investments for future years.,195,,
719,0.97,4559.321,4560.188,"Excellent, Councilmember Morales.",196,,
720,0.97,4560.188,4560.956,Thank you.,197,,
721,0.97,4560.956,4562.024,I think he said it well.,197,,
722,0.97,4562.024,4575.904,We are interested in looking at ways to Additionally support black girls in our community.,197,,
723,0.97,4575.904,4583.078,We want to start early in making sure that young girls get the attention and support that they need to be successful.,197,,
724,0.97,4583.078,4588.283,"So, what we are looking to do is ask D.E.A.L.",197,,
725,0.97,4588.283,4603.599,To create a plan for what a shift in their investment would look like so we are able to directly serve black girls and young women of color with more targeted investments in the city.,197,,
726,0.97,4603.599,4603.899,From the city.,197,,
727,0.97,4604.132,4607.135,Thank you very much.,197,,
728,0.97,4607.135,4607.803,Any questions on that?,197,,
729,0.97,4607.803,4617.813,On these last two they would be add not trying to spread the peanut butter thinner for those investments?,198,,
730,0.97,4617.813,4639.968,"Well, the statement of legislative intent is to study the first step would be to evaluate because our ""brother's keeper"" program is sort of mission driven to focus on young men, we could potentially be needing a different mechanism to shift investments.",199,,
731,0.97,4639.968,4642.371,This is a conversation over the last several years.,199,,
732,0.97,4642.371,4650.012,And because the mission is so specific I think there has been a little reluctance to move away from that.,199,,
733,0.97,4650.012,4666.962,What we need to figure out is if we need a different mechanism for making these kinds of investments and there is also as Brian said a proviso for the funding that is left that I believe is $1.2 million.,199,,
734,0.97,4666.962,4683.011,There would be for a certain portion of that remaining funding to be used to create a plan for investments and how it could be targeted for young women.,199,,
735,0.97,4683.011,4683.345,Excellent.,200,,
736,0.97,4683.345,4684.479,Thank you for that summary.,200,,
737,0.97,4684.479,4685.514,"Okay, let's go to the next one.",200,,
738,0.97,4685.514,4690.485,The third and final item for D.E.A.L.,201,,
739,0.97,4690.485,4699.194,Would fund a pilot program for a limited number of schools in partnership with community organizations to implement justice practices.,201,,
740,0.97,4699.194,4725.353,"The funding would allow them to have Coordinators or teams and facilitate school wide training for teachers and students to build and strengthen relationships, address behavior problems.",201,,
741,0.97,4725.353,4730.692,I was excited when I heard from the school district they would stop with school resource officers.,202,,
742,0.97,4730.692,4737.733,We have been talking about it for a couple years here in the South end which is where the school resource officers are located.,202,,
743,0.97,4737.733,4742.871,"So, that is an important step one in this process.",202,,
744,0.97,4742.871,4750.712,Step 2 is to replace that kind of a presence in the schools with restorative justice Coordinators.,202,,
745,0.97,4750.712,4757.319,So the idea here is to create a pilot program.,202,,
746,0.97,4757.319,4767.729,We do have some Cleveland high school has a restorative justice coordinator and they use levy money there.,202,,
747,0.97,4767.729,4771.199,And Emerson has partnership with Wallblock.,202,,
748,0.97,4771.199,4783.245,The idea is to create a pilot program to expand the opportunity for more schools to see what kind of work or restorative justice coordinator could do.,202,,
749,0.97,4783.245,4809.504,And in my perfect world we would move to be able to provide that kind of really Holistic Trauma- informed support to young people so that we provide that Holistic support rather than going to suspension when there are behavior issues at a school.,202,,
750,0.97,4809.504,4812.24,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",203,,
751,0.97,4812.24,4814.509,I am not seeing questions on this.,203,,
752,0.97,4814.509,4816.811,Appreciate you bringing this forward.,203,,
753,0.97,4816.811,4821.016,"I think that summarizes D.E.A.L., is that correct?",204,,
754,0.97,4821.016,4822.918,Thank you for your time today.,204,,
755,0.97,4822.918,4828.156,We will turn it over to Tom.,204,,
756,0.97,4828.156,4831.86,"Thank you, Madam chair.",205,,
757,0.97,4831.86,4837.365,This is on page 24 of the memo.,205,,
758,0.97,4837.365,4857.352,This is a proposal from Councilmember Sawant to rescind the $30 million cut to the strategic investment fund that is there to address Misplacement.,205,,
759,0.97,4857.352,4859.721,Councilmember Sawant carrying off a discussion from yesterday.,206,,
760,0.97,4859.721,4863.258,"Thank you for flagging this, please go ahead.",206,,
761,0.97,4863.258,4870.031,We had a discussion on this yesterday.,207,,
762,0.97,4870.031,4878.373,"The Mayor cuts to the strategic fund but that language is, in my view, designed to be vague and hide what is being cut.",207,,
763,0.97,4878.373,4893.722,It is different from the language that was used by her during last year's budget when she trumpeted she was creating this Fund and invest $30 million to address displacement in black and Brown communities.,207,,
764,0.97,4893.722,4902.964,As I pointed out yesterday the Mayor talks about this $30 million.,207,,
765,0.97,4902.964,4908.003,She neglected to invest a penny of these funds in real terms.,207,,
766,0.97,4908.003,4917.279,"Yesterday, many Councilmembers correctly objected to the Mayor of breaking this promise and at that time I had mentioned that my office submitted a form to cancel the cut.",207,,
767,0.97,4917.279,4917.846,Illuminate the cut.,207,,
768,0.97,4917.846,4922.25,It is what we have before us right now.,207,,
769,0.97,4922.25,4931.526,I really hope Councilmember support and cosponsor this budget amendment to Follow- through in practice what was expressed yesterday that is correct the opposition to this cut.,207,,
770,0.97,4931.526,4935.163,"And also, there was discussion how it could be paid for yesterday.",207,,
771,0.97,4935.163,4947.976,There are several good options and in this form A. we have not been descriptive.,207,,
772,0.97,4947.976,4957.319,Or Defunding the police by 50% that would free up $117 million or it could be funded in other ways discussed yesterday.,207,,
773,0.97,4957.319,4975.37,And if Councilmembers support restoring the funding and eliminating the cut of course I would be happy to have a conversation about what the funding source is as long as its funding source is Progressive.,207,,
774,0.97,4975.37,4976.905,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,208,,
775,0.97,4976.905,4990.819,"Just, you are talking about a funding source that is Progressive to fill where the $30 million was going to go so the exist 30 million can go to strategic investment fund?",208,,
776,0.97,4990.819,4991.119,Exactly.,209,,
777,0.97,4991.119,5001.096,I would also say it is given the recession is a question that--the same question applies to $100 million as well.,209,,
778,0.97,5001.096,5004.599,This is where it started.,209,,
779,0.97,5004.599,5007.836,There is an unfunded promise of $30 million last year.,209,,
780,0.97,5007.836,5023.918,"Yes, and the comments made yesterday about the strategic investment fund being for marginalized communities and focus at a higher rates.",210,,
781,0.97,5023.918,5027.856,There is a lot of overlap there where they would benefit.,210,,
782,0.97,5027.856,5041.97,"I would be interested in exploring as well what Dan mentioned yesterday, is the $30 million plus $70 to try to equal $100 if that was the intent of Council.",210,,
783,0.97,5041.97,5044.672,Just another way to think about it.,210,,
784,0.97,5044.672,5048.076,Apreciate you flagging it for folks consideration today.,210,,
785,0.97,5048.076,5048.343,Okay.,211,,
786,0.97,5048.343,5052.514,I am not seeing additional hands let's move on to the next one.,211,,
787,0.97,5052.514,5078.273,Item 2 under Finance General is a proposal from Councilmember Sawant to increase payroll expense tax rates with the intent to use the new revenue to stop budget cuts as proposed in the Mayor's budget.,212,,
788,0.97,5078.273,5083.411,Councilmember Sawant please go ahead.,213,,
789,0.97,5083.411,5085.814,-- you are on mute.,214,,
790,0.97,5085.814,5086.247,Sorry about that.,214,,
791,0.97,5086.247,5086.548,Sorry.,215,,
792,0.97,5086.548,5094.456,I was just saying some of the comments I just made for the previous item apply here as well.,216,,
793,0.97,5094.456,5105.6,"Basically given the recession, given the reduced revenues that are coming in because so much of the revenue generation is aggressive we face a dark choice.",216,,
794,0.97,5105.6,5126.554,Are we going to allow a budget that has huge amounts of cuts that will effect not only working people and poor people as a whole but effect black and Brown communities that are already marginalized.,216,,
795,0.97,5126.554,5129.39,It is generating the revenues that do not exist right now.,216,,
796,0.97,5129.39,5132.694,It is not something that cannot be avoided.,216,,
797,0.97,5132.694,5151.479,"It is really a question of--if the Council is willing to increase the taxes on big business that can be done legally and in addition is there, again the question of Defunding the police by 50% as well.",216,,
798,0.97,5151.479,5165.894,"And, also, you know, we as chair Mosqueda we made it Claire,--clear if the tax was not passed and the cuts would have been deeper.",216,,
799,0.97,5165.894,5191.386,"Even with the Amazon tax that has, you know, generated future revenues starting next year, as I mentioned earlier the proposed budget still has very deep cuts and it is really in my view a Sleight-Of-Hand that the Mayor is not counting the cuts as cuts so I do not accept the way things were presented in the presentation by the Mayor's office.",216,,
800,0.97,5191.386,5208.203,"Really as I said before, what we have is well over $200 million in our 2021 budget that is being cut and coming in library hours, transit and buses, roads, affordable housing, closing off community centers and pools.",216,,
801,0.97,5208.203,5215.877,"All of this, again, effects the same communities that are already being impacted by racism and police violence and so on.",216,,
802,0.97,5215.877,5218.98,"I think this, again, a concrete question.",216,,
803,0.97,5218.98,5222.517,Are we going to increase revenues?,216,,
804,0.97,5222.517,5225.92,We need progressive sources.,216,,
805,0.97,5225.92,5226.187,Okay.,217,,
806,0.97,5226.187,5226.654,Councilmember Sawant.,217,,
807,0.97,5226.654,5228.923,Any questions colleagues?,217,,
808,0.97,5228.923,5230.225,I just have two questions.,217,,
809,0.97,5230.225,5248.876,I don't see in the details here have you already identified at what rate folks would be taxed at or are you talking about dropping the threshold for the size of the total Seattle payroll for various companies?,217,,
810,0.97,5248.876,5254.349,Obvious low it could be done either way.,218,,
811,0.97,5254.349,5254.616,Exactly.,218,,
812,0.97,5254.616,5260.622,"So, I would really urge colleagues to say what their preferences are.",218,,
813,0.97,5260.622,5272.166,"But, one way to do it is to change the rate of payroll.",218,,
814,0.97,5272.166,5280.508,"The compensation of $150,000 to $500,000.",218,,
815,0.97,5280.508,5283.177,A rate of 1 .46%.,218,,
816,0.97,5283.177,5291.853,"And a rate of 2.92% and again, same, with businesses with payroll over $1 billion and above and change the rates there as well.",218,,
817,0.97,5291.853,5293.154,We have some numbers.,218,,
818,0.97,5293.154,5299.694,My staff will send around the details tonight to all Council offices for your review.,218,,
819,0.97,5299.694,5308.536,I think that increasing the tax rate on the top corporations that are already under the tax by the ordinance passed earlier this year is a good idea.,218,,
820,0.97,5308.536,5313.341,If you look at some of the top corporations and Amazon is not the only one.,218,,
821,0.97,5313.341,5315.743,It is just the most prominent one.,218,,
822,0.97,5315.743,5319.047,They increased their rate of profit during the pandemic.,218,,
823,0.97,5319.047,5330.258,It makes sense to tax them more.,218,,
824,0.97,5330.258,5334.062,Thank you very much Councilmember Sawant.,219,,
825,0.97,5334.062,5335.963,Not seeing anymore questions.,219,,
826,0.97,5335.963,5340.168,Does that conclude that?,219,,
827,0.97,5340.168,5349.377,Are we ready --,219,,
828,0.97,5349.377,5350.611,All right.,220,,
829,0.97,5350.611,5351.512,Good afternoon.,221,,
830,0.97,5351.512,5367.862,The first item for the Department of finance and administrative services is to increase the amount of funding available in the municipal energy efficiency program.,221,,
831,0.97,5367.862,5368.596,From Councilmember Lewis.,221,,
832,0.97,5368.596,5381.609,The 2020 budget included $4.5 million for city building energy efficiency projects.,221,,
833,0.97,5381.609,5398.092,The 2021 budget includes $2.5 million for those projects and those would increase funding for municipal building energy efficiency projects.,221,,
834,0.97,5398.092,5398.426,Excellent.,222,,
835,0.97,5398.426,5400.094,"Councilmember Lewis, please go ahead.",222,,
836,0.97,5400.094,5401.529,"Thank you, Madam chair.",223,,
837,0.97,5401.529,5437.865,This is in the spirit of my officer's interest in pursuing a carbon tax and looking more intently at really trying to increase the Sustainability of our environment and any standard that we set should obviously start with us as a city and the buildings that are within our power and within our Footprint and I would like to make sure that even in difficult times like this that we look at ways to make sure we are maintaining those investments and maintaining that commitment.,223,,
838,0.97,5437.865,5441.969,This is an area of interest of Parker Dawson on my staff.,223,,
839,0.97,5441.969,5457.552,I look forward to continue to work with them on developing this and reaching out to more officers.,223,,
840,0.97,5457.552,5458.352,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",224,,
841,0.97,5458.352,5470.765,I am not seeing questions at this moment or hearing any.,224,,
842,0.97,5470.765,5472.767,"Hi, Tom.",225,,
843,0.97,5472.767,5473.601,"Hi, chair.",226,,
844,0.97,5473.601,5483.911,This is proposed by Councilmember Lewis for Microbusiness tax relief for 3RD quarter and 4TH quarter business and occupation tax.,226,,
845,0.97,5483.911,5498.292,Thereat is the city's gross receipt tax.,226,,
846,0.97,5498.292,5500.962,And it was generally defined.,226,,
847,0.97,5500.962,5504.131,Low income and the nature of the business.,226,,
848,0.97,5504.131,5505.9,"Thanks so much, Tom.",227,,
849,0.97,5505.9,5510.605,"Just a reminder, maybe, yell a little bit on the zoom for us just a little hard to hear you.",227,,
850,0.97,5510.605,5514.642,I am going to turn it over to Councilmember Lewis.,227,,
851,0.97,5514.642,5516.811,"We did hear you, thank you.",227,,
852,0.97,5516.811,5520.448,I will turn it over to Councilmember Lewis to provide more content.,227,,
853,0.97,5520.448,5525.152,"And I just want to say, too, before jumping into it too much.",228,,
854,0.97,5525.152,5559.654,Great going back and forth with Tom a little bit on some of the complexities of how it might work and practice given the extent to which tax liability attaches for businesses this small and that it may not ultimately be something that could give an amount of release given a lot of the businesses may not even have reached a level of gross receipts.,228,,
855,0.97,5559.654,5587.315,"With that said, it is something that I want to look at in this budget cycle to see if we can develop some kind of program for next year to remit back some taxes for small or for small businesses that really taken a hit during the Covid-19 crisis due to the need to socially distance and reduced demand of people going out and patronizing businesses.",228,,
856,0.97,5587.315,5599.16,"There is still some work that needs to be done, obviously, we would be talking about Remitting revenue back at a time when we have a big deficit that is something that we would have to be aware of.",228,,
857,0.97,5599.16,5606.434,Given that we are in a position to where we cannot provide gifts of public funds relief from taxes.,228,,
858,0.97,5606.434,5611.372,It is one of the only other mechanisms potentially available to us.,228,,
859,0.97,5611.372,5626.087,"So, I certainly would like for us to see if there is a square to be circled here and get relief out the door for small businesses that have taken a hit and have not been able to take advantage of the limited relief we have been able to provide.",228,,
860,0.97,5626.087,5632.193,And that is--that is where this currently sits.,228,,
861,0.97,5632.193,5635.963,"Excellent, thank you very much, Councilmember Lewis.",229,,
862,0.97,5635.963,5642.636,I am not seeing any hands.,229,,
863,0.97,5642.636,5643.504,"Oh, Councilmember Strauss.",229,,
864,0.97,5643.504,5645.94,I wanted to thank you Councilmember Lewis.,230,,
865,0.97,5645.94,5652.98,I look forward to seeing more of there proposal as it moves forward and let me know how I can help.,230,,
866,0.97,5652.98,5653.614,"Thank you, both.",230,,
867,0.97,5653.614,5654.181,Excellent.,231,,
868,0.97,5654.181,5654.482,Thank you.,231,,
869,0.97,5654.482,5656.584,Similar to the comments I was going to make.,231,,
870,0.97,5656.584,5666.293,We know that this has been in long standing issue.,231,,
871,0.97,5666.293,5668.496,Even prior to Councilmember O'Brien's departure.,231,,
872,0.97,5668.496,5678.072,It has been a need prior to Covid-19 and as you said needed given the impact on the small businesses in the city.,231,,
873,0.97,5678.072,5688.916,Look forward to learning more from you all on this item.,231,,
874,0.97,5688.916,5690.885,I think that concluded that.,232,,
875,0.97,5690.885,5694.255,Moving on to Seattle fire Department.,232,,
876,0.97,5694.255,5695.99,"Thank you, Madam, chair.",233,,
877,0.97,5695.99,5705.132,Thank you members of the committee for those that are following along you can find the Seattle fire Department items on page 25.,233,,
878,0.97,5705.132,5708.436,"And, we have four items for the Seattle fire Department.",233,,
879,0.97,5708.436,5714.575,The first one is funding additional training for Seattle firefighters.,233,,
880,0.97,5714.575,5723.35,And this one is from.,233,,
881,0.97,5723.35,5734.862,"Defense, all of which will keep firefighters safe and increase transactions with persons in crisis and those suffering with mental illness.",233,,
882,0.97,5734.862,5736.53,Councilmember Mosqueda this is your item.,233,,
883,0.97,5736.53,5737.531,You summarized it well.,234,,
884,0.97,5737.531,5745.005,Most of this we have talked about over the last few months and years here.,234,,
885,0.97,5745.005,5747.942,I know it is an interest for many of us.,234,,
886,0.97,5747.942,5751.812,They are the ones that take care of us.,234,,
887,0.97,5751.812,5758.219,They see traumatic things every day while assisting others with the trauma they see.,234,,
888,0.97,5758.219,5775.002,Part of our city's responsibility is to take care of those that are providing medical care for our city and the well being of our residents and under scored when I did the ride along and I know Lewis has done and others are interested in.,234,,
889,0.97,5775.002,5789.283,Many of the firefighters and the case managers that I talked to talked about the experience that they have had with health one being able to spend time with individuals instead of just feeling like you have to respond to to the next call.,234,,
890,0.97,5789.283,5798.292,They have a chance to know the individuals they are helping instead of seeing people cycle in and out of Harborview or in and out of homelessness.,234,,
891,0.97,5798.292,5811.138,"Taking the time to get to know them and to work with case managers, to get to know their family members, to care not just for the wounds but the wounds inside.",234,,
892,0.97,5811.138,5816.844,Mental health trauma or substance abuse in some cases some issues they help respond to.,234,,
893,0.97,5816.844,5821.315,These are calls they are going to for folks that are housed and Unhoused.,234,,
894,0.97,5821.315,5830.457,And the Takeaway from many of their interactions have been how important it is to process what they are dealing with on a daily basis.,234,,
895,0.97,5830.457,5850.611,Process it so they can be better first responders for our firefighter Department and wanting to have much of what is Learnedwithin health one team and also within the peer support training team that already exists and the mental health first aid course that many firefighters take.,234,,
896,0.97,5850.611,5871.732,"I know Councilmember Herbold you are familiar with many of the programs but I just wanted to put this form A. out there because especially right now as we are seeing more and more people without services due to Covid-19 who need mental health Councilling, case management, dealing with Ptsd and have fewer resources because of so many programs scaled back under Covid-19.",234,,
897,0.97,5871.732,5881.375,It is an excellent way to provide many of the Trauma- informed care and training to other firefighters across the Department.,234,,
898,0.97,5881.375,5883.077,Councilmember Herbold would you add anything to that?,234,,
899,0.97,5883.077,5885.279,Let me see here.,235,,
900,0.97,5885.279,5887.982,I will make sure I am off mute.,235,,
901,0.97,5887.982,5890.284,"Yes, thank you very much Madam chair.",235,,
902,0.97,5890.284,5900.694,The thing that I would add and it ties into one of my budget actions but I will mention it here.,235,,
903,0.97,5900.694,5915.409,We heard a lot today about the fact that the separations of the Seattle police Department are higher than anticipated.,235,,
904,0.97,5915.409,5942.603,"Every year the city does a projected staffing report and it includes in that staffing report the numbers of people they anticipate coming on and the number of people they anticipate leaving and of course, it is all in the news today how many more people how many more officers left in September than projected to leave in September.",235,,
905,0.97,5942.603,5950.01,"It is also, I think, important to note that this happened for the fire Department as well.",235,,
906,0.97,5950.01,5956.617,The annual separations number for the Seattle fire Department is 38 firefighters.,235,,
907,0.97,5956.617,5961.855,"And as of the end of, I believe August, 45 firefighters have left.",235,,
908,0.97,5961.855,5992.519,And I think that is really a reflection of how stressful it is for our frontline workers to be managing multiple crisis and I appreciate you are identifying the need for this support and training in recognition of the impacts of doing this Life-Saving work.,235,,
909,0.97,5992.519,5992.82,Thank you.,235,,
910,0.97,5992.82,5995.622,Thank you very much.,236,,
911,0.97,5995.622,5997.691,Any additional comments on this one?,236,,
912,0.97,5997.691,5997.891,Okay.,236,,
913,0.97,5997.891,6002.029,Thank you very much.,236,,
914,0.97,6002.029,6012.74,"You and mentioned multiple crisis that folks are dealing with at the same time and it is manifesting in the people that they see, right?",236,,
915,0.97,6012.74,6024.118,We heard from the health one they showed up to folks house that probably lost their job and lost their income and were dealing with so much more Isolatio than they usually do.,236,,
916,0.97,6024.118,6045.205,"Folks are starting firefighters within their own homes and I think that it is an example of where the multiple crisis is overlapping, isolation, mental health needs and lack of resources or economic downturn is causing people to try to figure out how to stay warm and that is where our first responders are showing up to.",236,,
917,0.97,6045.205,6052.179,I appreciate your added to that piece and look forward to working with you all on this.,236,,
918,0.97,6052.179,6053.68,Customer Herbold you are up next.,236,,
919,0.97,6053.68,6055.582,We will turn it back over to you.,236,,
920,0.97,6055.582,6065.659,As you mentioned the next item comes to you all from Councilmember Herbold.,237,,
921,0.97,6065.659,6074.301,Adding funding for Aeds and this proposal is--it would allocate additional dollars to purchase Aeds.,237,,
922,0.97,6074.301,6094.188,The city firefighters and Paramedics use Aeds on a daily basis and this recognizes the importance of maintaining and replacing the complement of Aeds and highlights the importance of maintaining a device on every single Sfd apparatus.,237,,
923,0.97,6094.188,6100.694,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Herbold?",238,,
924,0.97,6100.694,6101.562,Thank you.,239,,
925,0.97,6101.562,6105.933,"As far as narrative to add to this, thank you, Greg.",239,,
926,0.97,6105.933,6108.135,I think that is a pretty complete description.,239,,
927,0.97,6108.135,6159.086,I guess the only thing I would add is the fire Department currently owns no Aeds and there is a brood spread of the number of devices that would be optimal to outfit the fire Department and it is important that we support the ambulance environment is dangerous because of high speed driving and hazardous road conditions and it poses a safety risk for the crew who are often standing and Unrestrained in a confined space while performing Cpr.,239,,
928,0.97,6159.086,6172.666,"Still waiting for the budget office response but we Understnd that the fire Department could purchase refurbished ones for $1,000 a unit.",239,,
929,0.97,6172.666,6190.284,"And, again like I mentioned we have a brood range of what the fire Department would need and what the estimate is from the Union.",239,,
930,0.97,6190.284,6198.792,We will get back to out this.,239,,
931,0.97,6198.792,6205.999,I don't see additional hands I will add my appreciation for you bringing this forward and you mentioned the Union.,240,,
932,0.97,6205.999,6213.707,"Iaff local 27, the letter that they sent us all on October 8th includes this item.",240,,
933,0.97,6213.707,6218.245,3 items on the list that you have included all of them here on the slide.,240,,
934,0.97,6218.245,6221.548,Appreciate you bringing that forward.,240,,
935,0.97,6221.548,6231.558,And we appreciate the folks at Iff27 as well for sending over their list of needs in this crisis.,240,,
936,0.97,6231.558,6233.694,"Okay, Greg, let's go to the next one.",241,,
937,0.97,6233.694,6238.231,The next one also from Councilmember Herbold.,242,,
938,0.97,6238.231,6239.967,Adding funding for Bunking gear.,242,,
939,0.97,6239.967,6255.315,"This would increase funding for Bunking gear that is getting older, expiring, wearing out and may not provide first responders with solid technology they need to keep them safe from extreme fires and dangerous emergencies.",242,,
940,0.97,6255.315,6256.883,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold please go ahead.",243,,
941,0.97,6256.883,6270.197,The only thing that I would add to that is the utility of the Bunking gear allows firefighters to more aggressively attack fires and victims.,244,,
942,0.97,6270.197,6274.001,It contributes to saving lives?,244,,
943,0.97,6274.001,6281.241,The budget might be to include the addition of what are called ballistic sets.,244,,
944,0.97,6281.241,6290.484,Cbo reported that the fire Department has 142 sets and 230 would be optimal.,244,,
945,0.97,6290.484,6303.664,They protect firefighters and Paramedics at scenes of violence and give them peace of mind for rescuing vulnerable patients.,244,,
946,0.97,6303.664,6306.3,Thank you very much.,245,,
947,0.97,6306.3,6309.903,I am not seeing addition hands.,245,,
948,0.97,6309.903,6311.471,Thank you for summarizing.,245,,
949,0.97,6311.471,6318.612,Good example how those are Life- saving devices in the city of Los Angeles from that letter as well.,245,,
950,0.97,6318.612,6319.446,"Okay Greg, the next one.",246,,
951,0.97,6319.446,6340.4,The last one under the Seattle fire Department is Reenstating Council funding for reverse the cut of fire examines and reverse the cut of 20 firefighters from the recruit class in 2021 from Councilmember Herbold.,247,,
952,0.97,6340.4,6345.505,"And, this one is targeting a specific, a couple specific actions in the proposed budget.",247,,
953,0.97,6345.505,6361.688,"One would reduce the class from 60-40, and the number of recruits that would be in the Sfd class for 2021 as well as suspend on a 1 time basis the Department's annual testing for firefighters.",247,,
954,0.97,6361.688,6370.597,"And, so, these actions would reduce the budget by $1.3 million and $219,000 respectfully.",247,,
955,0.97,6370.597,6380.774,The proposal recognizes the fire Department has been experiencing a higher than normal separation rate and that 412 firefighters are currently eligible for retirement.,247,,
956,0.97,6380.774,6394.454,It would ensure the fire Department has enough stable and solid funding in 2021 and in 2022 should they have additional unplanned separations.,247,,
957,0.97,6394.454,6396.49,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",248,,
958,0.97,6396.49,6399.76,"I am so sorry, did you have something to add?",249,,
959,0.97,6399.76,6404.531,I just want to acknowledge we left number 4 out of the paper.,250,,
960,0.97,6404.531,6411.905,For folks following along in the memo this one was--it was submitted by the deadline but we left it off.,250,,
961,0.97,6411.905,6429.656,I will note that Greg did include discussion of the fire Department staffing issues on page 17 that support this not support but provide information.,250,,
962,0.97,6429.656,6435.462,For folks at home use your pen and write in number 4 in the middle of page 25.,251,,
963,0.97,6435.462,6443.57,"And I will, Madam chair, include it in the police Department paper so it is on record.",252,,
964,0.97,6443.57,6443.837,Okay.,253,,
965,0.97,6443.837,6444.171,No problem.,253,,
966,0.97,6444.171,6444.671,Councilmember Herbold.,253,,
967,0.97,6444.671,6445.338,Thank you for everybody.,254,,
968,0.97,6445.338,6456.149,I am sure it took a dozen people working together to get it into the power point today.,254,,
969,0.97,6456.149,6456.716,Replacing the slide.,254,,
970,0.97,6456.716,6457.517,All of what that took.,254,,
971,0.97,6457.517,6459.586,Problem low an hour before the meeting began.,254,,
972,0.97,6459.586,6464.558,"So, thank you, thank you for doing that.",254,,
973,0.97,6464.558,6485.579,The only other bit that I would add to this is a reminder to Councilmembers that last year we increased funding in order to grow the size of the fire Department recruit class.,254,,
974,0.97,6485.579,6503.53,The issues of combined large number of firefighters eligible for retirement is an issue that need some ongoing attention in a way where we maintain Sustainability in order to address that.,254,,
975,0.97,6503.53,6509.97,We started that last year by increasing the size of the fire Department recruit class.,254,,
976,0.97,6509.97,6524.751,I was disappointed to see that the pro Prosed budget is did include that in the right direction and look forward to working with folks on this item.,254,,
977,0.97,6524.751,6535.328,"Thank you very much, vice chair Herbold and thank you, Greg, I am also appreciative that this item got include inside the discussion today.",255,,
978,0.97,6535.328,6555.548,I think this is actually the under belly of our or the under current of why there is so much stress right now among various firefighters and if we might just for context refer folks to the data provided in the later comparing Seattle to San Francisco.,255,,
979,0.97,6555.548,6579.873,"Úwhere we see that San Francisc with just about 100,000 more residents in their city they have a significant amount more allocated per capita than Seattle does.",255,,
980,0.97,6579.873,6583.276,Compared to 481 annually for residents in San Francisco's fire Department.,255,,
981,0.97,6583.276,6583.743,Quite a difference.,255,,
982,0.97,6583.743,6585.445,"So, thank you for calling that out.",255,,
983,0.97,6585.445,6599.96,The only reason I did not reference that is because of all of the controversy about using a per capita analysis for purposes of determining the right size of the police Department.,256,,
984,0.97,6599.96,6611.571,I don't--I don't know if that same controversy exists in the fire Department.,256,,
985,0.97,6611.571,6621.414,"So, I-I think the point I am trying to focus on is getting ahead of the wave of retirements that are coming and are going to continue to come.",256,,
986,0.97,6621.414,6627.354,"Well said and good reminder, thank you for that.",257,,
987,0.97,6627.354,6627.554,Okay.,257,,
988,0.97,6627.554,6627.854,Moving on.,257,,
989,0.97,6627.854,6631.257,Thank you very much office of housing.,257,,
990,0.97,6631.257,6631.491,Tracy.,257,,
991,0.97,6631.491,6632.926,Good to see you again.,257,,
992,0.97,6632.926,6634.427,Hello.,258,,
993,0.97,6634.427,6635.395,Good afternoon Councilmembers.,258,,
994,0.97,6635.395,6647.774,"You will find the description, the full description of there's proposals on page 25 of the memo that you have attached to the agenda.",258,,
995,0.97,6647.774,6670.463,"The first, adding funding for the Etheopia mixed use project.",258,,

1002,0.97,6693.153,6698.591,I don't have a lot to add.,263,,
1003,0.97,6698.591,6720.08,This project is important here because it would provide 90 units of affordable senior housing to vulnerable low income seniors in the East African community at least that is part of the hope that some folks would be able to participate and benefit from these units.,263,,
1004,0.97,6720.08,6740.567,"It would provide a gathering space and as we have talked about when we are talking, considering these Community-Led projects real challenge with these projects is not finding the funding for the housing portion but actually finding the funding to finance the ground floor construction.",263,,
1005,0.97,6740.567,6743.57,"And, that is what the issue is here.",263,,
1006,0.97,6743.57,6752.479,The project is expected to begin construction in May.,263,,

1016,0.97,6793.586,6799.926,"I can get that, I am sure on the housing--I don't know for sure on the housing side.",266,,
1017,0.97,6799.926,6802.829,I think they have housing trust money.,266,,
1018,0.97,6802.829,6805.064,Maybe community building money I can find out.,266,,
1019,0.97,6805.064,6822.849,And I do know they are also talking to the Department of Commerce and trying to get additional state funding.,267,,

1031,0.97,6877.136,6889.082,We have a real success story up here in North Seattle with the Aurora Commons under the tireless leadership of their Ceo.,274,,

1037,0.97,6934.227,6940.033,They partner with public health to support testing and treatment of HIV.,274,,
1038,0.97,6940.033,6950.276,The majority of funding will help them expand their service capacity in this high needs corridor of Aurora North.,274,,
1039,0.97,6950.276,6958.985,"They are occupying 200,000 square feet but could have the whole building they are in and have close to 10 times more of their current Footprint.",274,,

1044,0.97,6993.953,6997.023,It is under way to DISCUS the Aurora common's project.,274,,
1045,0.97,6997.023,7000.993,I want to add a few more comments.,274,,
1046,0.97,7000.993,7015.575,The location of service providers makes the Aurora Commons an attractive project for public Funders because there is a need to fund one site vs multiple and provides a one-stop shop for people seeking services.,274,,
1047,0.97,7015.575,7020.613,That is what they are doing since they have been in our funding cycle.,274,,
1048,0.97,7020.613,7035.862,They are in a good position when it comes to operating dollars due to their partnership with U-Dub medicine and lessen the cost of any operating costs in the near future to the city.,274,,
1049,0.97,7035.862,7048.474,"So, we have invested in Aurora Commons to build capacity and expand homelessness and health care and they have been successful.",274,,
1050,0.97,7048.474,7053.546,They are a brick and mortar we can point to saying we gave them money and they have done right by it.,274,,
1051,0.97,7053.546,7060.253,We have a success story of Community-Based organization delivering social services.,274,,
1052,0.97,7060.253,7064.424,Now we have an opportunity to help them build low income housing.,274,,
1053,0.97,7064.424,7069.262,Currently they are zoned for another 75 feet that is I think seven floors.,274,,
1054,0.97,7069.262,7081.04,"In which they hope to build low income housing, expand their clinic in space and hours and provide an the spot shelter for those waiting for a treatment bed.",274,,
1055,0.97,7081.04,7094.787,Just to end it on a note to give perspective here I would say Aurora Commons is probably where Seattle was three years ago.,274,,
1056,0.97,7094.787,7107.233,We spent three budget cycles investing in the capacity of the administration and investing in the brick and mortar.,274,,
1057,0.97,7107.233,7127.587,Everything we have been talking about for the last six months about giving money to community organizations that provide services that not only shelter the unsheltered but prevent homelessness and address many of the medical issues in some of our encampment issues in the North end.,274,,
1058,0.97,7127.587,7139.532,"With that, I am will hoping that my colleagues will take a second look and expanding the Aurora Commons, thank you.",274,,

1062,0.97,7149.842,7150.71,It is putting it lightly.,276,,
1063,0.97,7150.71,7167.46,It is a program that I am excited to support with you and in the interest of time I will hold my remarks because the accolades I can give to the Aurora Commons could last from now until Monday.,276,,
1064,0.97,7167.46,7168.294,Thank you.,276,,

1073,0.97,7180.706,7192.752,I did have a chance to see a similar type of health care clinic offered at North Star health line when we went up there to do a tour.,281,,
1074,0.97,7192.752,7198.724,I hope their clinic is going well.,281,,
1075,0.97,7198.724,7199.058,Thank you.,282,,
1076,0.97,7199.058,7201.027,Item number three.,283,,
1077,0.97,7201.027,7213.039,This would add $49 million in funding to increase the housing investments in 2021 to match the funding level included in the budget for office of housing.,283,,
1078,0.97,7213.039,7215.908,This is sponsored by Councilmember Sawant.,283,,
1079,0.97,7215.908,7216.909,Thank you.,284,,
1080,0.97,7216.909,7218.244,Councilmember Sawant?,284,,
1081,0.97,7218.244,7218.778,Thank you.,285,,
1082,0.97,7218.778,7235.995,In the Player's proposal 2021 budget the office of housing has $49 million less due to a cut used to build affordable housing compared to the budget adopted last year.,285,,
1083,0.97,7235.995,7254.847,"As the economic crisis leaves people jobless and also consequently if they don't have other resources homeless, the city should be Massively expanding the construction of affordable housing and instead, the Mayor has decided to invest 0 dollars of the fund in affordable housing.",285,,
1084,0.97,7254.847,7260.886,I want to clarify that the office of housing budget is an example of what I was talking about before.,285,,
1085,0.97,7260.886,7274.3,"That is, that how you count a certain change is, you know, you can have a Sleight-Of-Hand and call it a technical change as opposed to recognizing it is a cut compared to last year.",285,,
1086,0.97,7274.3,7285.511,There is one of those examples where it is--where it is--they are terming it technical change but it depends on your point of view.,285,,
1087,0.97,7285.511,7299.592,The reality is the Mayor's budget does not acknowledge the cuts even though the budget is $49 million less than last year.,285,,
1088,0.97,7299.592,7301.093,The excuse is 1-Time funds.,285,,
1089,0.97,7301.093,7302.128,Yes t is accurate.,285,,
1090,0.97,7302.128,7318.177,"However, from the point of view of working people, struggling to find affordable housing it does not matter if the city's revenue source is levy, General Fund, Mha program or proceeds from property.",285,,
1091,0.97,7318.177,7321.18,It does not change one shingle on the housing.,285,,
1092,0.97,7321.18,7331.657,What is that the Mayor is proposing $49 million less and the good jobs and construction and maintenance of the housing would create.,285,,
1093,0.97,7331.657,7350.076,It can all be funded by the budget amendment I spoke to earlier increasing the rate of the Amazon tax that was passed earlier and I hope the Council will support this to at least for a certain degree to Prioritize affordable housing.,285,,
1094,0.97,7350.076,7355.081,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Sawant.",286,,
1095,0.97,7355.081,7356.682,Any questions on this?,286,,
1096,0.97,7356.682,7356.882,Okay.,286,,
1097,0.97,7356.882,7378.437,"I will answer a question not to challenge the summary you provided I think it is important for us to recognize a difference in the amount of money from this year to next year's budget so I can understand what the executive's office are saying, obviously a $49 million cut would be concerning.",286,,
1098,0.97,7378.437,7384.61,How would the executive's office frame this?,286,,
1099,0.97,7384.61,7391.05,To remind you last year they did receive one time allocation of the Mercer Megablock proceeds.,287,,
1100,0.97,7391.05,7393.986,That was a big part of the $49 million.,287,,
1101,0.97,7393.986,7402.061,"But they received some of the sales tax, the new sales tax on affordable housing.",287,,
1102,0.97,7402.061,7403.262,That is an ongoing allegation.,287,,
1103,0.97,7403.262,7416.842,Going with a forward funding of that and the same on remembering that we authorized them to spend $25 million knowing they will get $25 million of revenue over the next 5 years to repay that.,287,,
1104,0.97,7416.842,7423.749,Legitimately the one time property tax sales from Mercer Megablock were the one time.,287,,
1105,0.97,7423.749,7427.086,They are honest saying this is one time money provided last year.,287,,
1106,0.97,7427.086,7437.763,We all knew it was one time money and not continued.,287,,
1107,0.97,7437.763,7438.063,Okay.,288,,
1108,0.97,7438.063,7442.201,Thank you for that reminder.,288,,
1109,0.97,7442.201,7442.568,Yep.,289,,
1110,0.97,7442.568,7445.604,Councilmember Sawant did you want to speak on it again?,290,,
1111,0.97,7445.604,7454.113,"I don't think that they have in any way Factulely been accurate, as I said myself it is--yes, it is true it is one time funding.",291,,
1112,0.97,7454.113,7467.159,"In reality you can look at this, this particular budget amendment from my office simply something that is used previously existing number to make sure that we have at least that much going forward.",291,,
1113,0.97,7467.159,7488.881,"But, really, we could just as well have done a separate budget amendment where we recognize that funds for affordable housing are low and extremely inadequate and we need to increase that by X number of dollars N . that sense it does not matter if this particular set of $49 million was a one time fund or not.",291,,
1114,0.97,7488.881,7498.29,"What remains true regardless is affordable housing is under funded, at this moment, and the Mayor's budget is not coming close to doing justice to it.",291,,
1115,0.97,7498.29,7501.393,The funds are not allocating funds for affordable housing.,291,,
1116,0.97,7501.393,7506.298,I believe the city council should do this one.,291,,
1117,0.97,7506.298,7509.301,"Thank you, Councilmember.",292,,
1118,0.97,7509.301,7509.502,Okay.,292,,
1119,0.97,7509.502,7509.869,Next item here.,292,,
1120,0.97,7509.869,7510.202,Yep.,293,,
1121,0.97,7510.202,7510.803,Number 4.,294,,
1122,0.97,7510.803,7523.916,"Yes, this proposal would add $20 million in funding to increase--I am sorry, yes, $20 million in funding increase for gas or oil heating to electric.",295,,
1123,0.97,7523.916,7531.357,It would expand the Weatherization program and it is from Councilmember Sawant.,295,,
1124,0.97,7531.357,7534.66,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant, let's go ahead.",296,,
1125,0.97,7534.66,7536.128,Thank you.,297,,
1126,0.97,7536.128,7549.275,So this budget action would add $20 million to the office of housing to subsidize Retro.,297,,
1127,0.97,7549.275,7549.975,There is something.,297,,
1128,0.97,7549.975,7562.755,Some of the most important investments that will be funded by Amazon tax starting in 2022.,297,,
1129,0.97,7562.755,7576.468,"Starting immediately in 2021 and we know all of that was, of course, proceeded by the environmental justice movement and indigenous people and others fighting for the green resolution and so on last year.",297,,
1130,0.97,7576.468,7585.144,So the smoke filled skies this fall has under lined we cannot wait until it is convenient for big business to start investing.,297,,
1131,0.97,7585.144,7586.312,That will not happen.,297,,
1132,0.97,7586.312,7593.419,"So, it has to be done publicly and this budget amendment would start some of the investments in 2021.",297,,
1133,0.97,7593.419,7600.826,The funding level is consistent with what is projected by the tax starting in 2022.,297,,
1134,0.97,7600.826,7653.012,"I would also part of the idea of the green new deal and we need living wage jobs and the living economy and the job losses and the recession that we are seeing unfold us these new jobs will be essentially the livelihoods of working class people and some of the same communities that are most impacted by the climate crisis and, in this form A. my office is not Perscriptive of where the funds are coming from but it could be from the Amazon tax rate or funded by Defunding the police or any other progressive revenue sources that Councilmembers might think about.",297,,
1135,0.97,7653.012,7655.447,"Thank you very much, any questions on this item?",298,,
1136,0.97,7655.447,7658.283,Not seeing or hearing any.,298,,

1154,0.97,7777.703,7788.347,This includes doctors that had not been spent this year pause of that later than expected start and so you are carrying it forward.,302,,
1155,0.97,7788.347,7795.587,"Just clarifying, the Mayor, do we know, had the Mayor already allocated for the use of the dollars in other ways?",303,,
1156,0.97,7795.587,7795.821,No.,304,,
1157,0.97,7795.821,7816.809,These moneys are secured we did a fund swap of General fund for Esg as part of the second quarter supplemental to secure it from any of the reductions that might have been required because of the general fund reductions.,304,,
1158,0.97,7816.809,7817.075,Smart.,305,,
1159,0.97,7817.075,7838.463,"I was just going to add the reason for the swap at the time or one of the reasons for the swap at the time was in recognition that we did not want this to be one-time funding and so, by doing the swap we made it possible for us to be identifying an ongoing fund source.",306,,
1160,0.97,7838.463,7838.797,Excellent.,307,,
1161,0.97,7838.797,7847.005,"Thank you very much, thank you for your past work on there and speaking for this piece on behalf of Councilmember Gonzalez.",307,,
1162,0.97,7847.005,7856.381,"To respond to state money in the Ethiopia village, it has gotten an award of a trust fund of $3 million.",308,,
1163,0.97,7856.381,7857.082,That was fast work.,309,,
1164,0.97,7857.082,7857.883,Thank you very much.,309,,
1165,0.97,7857.883,7859.518,I will make a note of that.,309,,
1166,0.97,7859.518,7860.419,Thank you.,310,,
1167,0.97,7860.419,7862.788,$3 million from the housing trust fund.,310,,
1168,0.97,7862.788,7863.188,All right.,311,,
1169,0.97,7863.188,7865.09,"Tracy, it is great to see you again.",311,,
1170,0.97,7865.09,7865.557,You bet.,312,,
1171,0.97,7865.557,7866.291,Take care.,313,,
1172,0.97,7866.291,7869.494,See you at the next time around.,313,,
1173,0.97,7869.494,7869.962,Welcome Amy.,314,,
1174,0.97,7869.962,7871.697,Amy good to see you again.,314,,
1175,0.97,7871.697,7876.268,Moving on to office of immigrant and refugee affairs.,314,,
1176,0.97,7876.268,7879.838,Thank you.,315,,
1177,0.97,7879.838,7880.472,Good afternoon.,315,,
1178,0.97,7880.472,7886.278,There is one potential Council action for office of immigrant and refugee affairs.,315,,
1179,0.97,7886.278,7896.455,Found on page 26 of the miscellaneous paper.,315,,
1180,0.97,7896.455,7902.194,It will restore the network to its 2020 level of $1 million.,315,,
1181,0.97,7902.194,7904.83,This action is sponsored by Council President Gonzalez.,315,,
1182,0.97,7904.83,7916.408,The legal defense network was established in 2017 by Seattle and King County to support to immigrants and refugees.,315,,
1183,0.97,7916.408,7924.95,"Without the budget proposal total funding for the network, including funding from King County, would be $1.",315,,
1184,0.97,7924.95,7926.351,6 million in 2021.,315,,
1185,0.97,7926.351,7929.154,It would be increased to $1.8 million in 2021.,315,,
1186,0.97,7933.692,7934.226,Excellent.,316,,
1187,0.97,7934.226,7936.428,Councilmember Herbold would you like to speak to this one?,316,,
1188,0.97,7936.428,7937.095,Thank you very much.,317,,
1189,0.97,7937.095,7955.247,I think it is important to put the issue within the context of the rights that are guaranteed to people to have legal representation but a recognition when it comes to deportation proceedings a lawyer is not appointed for individuals.,317,,
1190,0.97,7955.247,7964.089,The study shows that having legal representation means you are four times more likely to be released from detention.,317,,
1191,0.97,7964.089,7977.035,The city's work in this area has shown many individuals facing deportation actually qualify to apply for Asylum.,317,,
1192,0.97,7977.035,7980.572,Thank you very much.,318,,
1193,0.97,7980.572,7985.01,"Thank you, and Councilmember Gonzalez for bringing it forget and thank you for speaking on her behalf today.",318,,
1194,0.97,7985.01,7987.412,Any questions colleagues?,318,,
1195,0.97,7987.412,7987.612,Okay.,318,,
1196,0.97,7987.612,7990.215,I am seeing none.,318,,
1197,0.97,7990.215,7991.817,"Councilmember Herbold, thanks again.",318,,
1198,0.97,7991.817,7997.689,Moving on to Inspector General for public safety.,319,,
1199,0.97,7997.689,7999.524,"Greg, Hi, Greg and good-bye Amy.",319,,
1200,0.97,7999.524,8000.459,Members of committee.,320,,
1201,0.97,8000.459,8003.962,If you are following along it is page 26 of your memo.,320,,
1202,0.97,8003.962,8007.933,The Office of Inspector General for public safety.,320,,
1203,0.97,8007.933,8019.378,One item and that is to add funding to provide additional resources for the Oig to conduct a Sentinal event.,320,,
1204,0.97,8019.378,8045.137,"It is Plural here but there is one in particular that Councilmember Gonzalez, she is bringing it forward to have more funding so they can look specifically at the demonstrations, the black lives demonstrations over the summer for which they are conducting a Sentinal event review and may need more funding.",320,,
1205,0.97,8045.137,8049.875,That is the sum of this one.,320,,
1206,0.97,8049.875,8050.575,Excellent.,321,,
1207,0.97,8050.575,8050.909,Thank you.,321,,
1208,0.97,8050.909,8054.88,Councilmember Herbold would you like to speak on behalf of Gonzalez for this one?,321,,
1209,0.97,8054.88,8056.581,I would very much.,322,,
1210,0.97,8056.581,8063.989,I also met with the inspector general about this item and I am very supportive of it.,322,,
1211,0.97,8063.989,8089.915,The interest in having the office of Inspector General do a review as a way to address issues that in some cases may not result in findings of wrongdoing or sustained complaints but still there is clearly things that went wrong.,322,,
1212,0.97,8089.915,8105.464,"And, the CPC, the police Commission last year asked that the office of Inspector General put the effort to pilot a Sentinal review.",322,,
1213,0.97,8105.464,8114.272,They made the request last year and really pleased that the Oig is acting on that request by the CPC.,322,,
1214,0.97,8114.272,8121.012,Key aspect of the review requires intensive community engagement.,322,,
1215,0.97,8121.012,8133.225,I understand that the office of Inspector General needs additional funds really to support the success of this really critical body of work and to do that deep community engagement.,322,,
1216,0.97,8133.225,8142.267,The goals of the review are to focus on community perspectives and concerns around an event.,322,,
1217,0.97,8142.267,8151.109,Identify the root causes of negative outcomes and improve for future tragedies or harm to the community.,322,,
1218,0.97,8151.109,8151.409,Thank you.,322,,
1219,0.97,8151.409,8156.982,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",323,,
1220,0.97,8156.982,8158.049,"Colleagues, questions on that one?",323,,
1221,0.97,8158.049,8161.653,I am seeing none.,324,,
1222,0.97,8161.653,8161.953,Thank you.,324,,
1223,0.97,8161.953,8162.487,"Thanks, Greg.",325,,
1224,0.97,8162.487,8170.428,We will move on to the legislative Department.,325,,
1225,0.97,8170.428,8172.264,Hello.,326,,
1226,0.97,8172.264,8199.958,"Our next proposal from Pedersen will add $450,000 to complete studies to implement interrelated transportation programs authorized to the growth management Act and another pursue--[Indiscernible]--Councilmember Pedersen?",326,,
1227,0.97,8199.958,8213.038,"As we seek additional revenues it is important to know that we can collect impact fees, the state government provides two paths.",327,,
1228,0.97,8213.038,8216.741,We can use one or both.,327,,
1229,0.97,8216.741,8221.346,"The growth management act, GM a and or the transportation district.",327,,
1230,0.97,8221.346,8229.12,"Impacts from new real estate development include the increased cost and demand on bridges, streets, schools, parks and fire stations.",327,,
1231,0.97,8229.12,8235.527,Most districts in King County and Washington State and in California and other areas charge real estate developer impact fees.,327,,
1232,0.97,8235.527,8265.89,"When we adopted the ordinance for the Seattle transportation we added 5 bills for transportation fees including one that said where as in response to public request that the city pursue sources of revenue to support it, the city council intends to impose a transportation impact fee under Rcw.",327,,
1233,0.97,8265.89,8277.769,It could fund capital and other transportation.,327,,
1234,0.97,8277.769,8283.308,It can fund the review from both potential paths.,327,,
1235,0.97,8283.308,8283.908,Thank you.,327,,
1236,0.97,8283.908,8289.914,Thank you very much.,328,,
1237,0.97,8289.914,8291.916,Councilmember Pedersen.,328,,
1238,0.97,8291.916,8294.986,Questions on this item?,328,,
1239,0.97,8294.986,8301.393,Councilmember Herbold go ahead my would like a little more understanding of the required study as it relates to the pact.,328,,
1240,0.97,8301.393,8310.235,I thought we were on the track.,328,,
1241,0.97,8310.235,8315.54,To implement the path I was unaware of future studies needed to implement it.,328,,
1242,0.97,8315.54,8318.476,I can speak to that a little bit.,329,,
1243,0.97,8318.476,8335.727,"It will depend in part on what, on if the Council wants to continue with the project list that if they do not want to continue with that list then we will need a new rate study.",329,,
1244,0.97,8335.727,8348.106,"If they want to continue with that list, the city would need to update that.",329,,
1245,0.97,8348.106,8352.143,Under either circumstance there is Ork that needs to be done on the authorized route.,329,,
1246,0.97,8352.143,8352.977,Okay.,330,,
1247,0.97,8352.977,8353.311,Thank you.,330,,
1248,0.97,8353.311,8362.353,I was--it was my understanding that the update to the current list did not require anymore studies.,330,,
1249,0.97,8362.353,8366.291,"You know, so, are it is--it is dated.",331,,
1250,0.97,8366.291,8375.1,"The information, or the assumptions of the cost date back essentially to about a year ago now.",331,,
1251,0.97,8375.1,8379.137,Some of that would need to be updated.,331,,
1252,0.97,8379.137,8383.508,The bigger question is that still the list that the Council wants to proceed?,331,,
1253,0.97,8383.508,8389.914,That list is based on a variety of projects that were identified in the city's plans.,331,,
1254,0.97,8389.914,8399.591,The city wanted to pursue a different list or add potentially Capacity-Related Improvemnts to that list we would need an update to that study.,331,,
1255,0.97,8399.591,8399.958,Thank you.,332,,
1256,0.97,8399.958,8402.36,I am really supportive of this direction.,332,,
1257,0.97,8402.36,8415.907,I don't--I am concerned about updating a list in a way that would slow down the work that we have been doing.,332,,
1258,0.97,8415.907,8426.284,We have had an appeal.,332,,
1259,0.97,8428.486,8429.287,We recognize it.,332,,
1260,0.97,8429.287,8436.427,Perhaps not costing us anymore time to do what is being suggested here.,332,,
1261,0.97,8436.427,8443.201,I am concerned that the analysis that you are talking about would take more time.,332,,
1262,0.97,8443.201,8448.54,We would then risk another legal appeal and we would be significantly slowed down.,332,,
1263,0.97,8448.54,8464.389,We have been plugging along on there for years now and I would like to see some progress on the COMP plan related to transportation fees.,332,,
1264,0.97,8464.389,8470.495,"Councilmember--I am sorry, did you have something to say as well?",333,,
1265,0.97,8470.495,8470.728,Yes.,334,,
1266,0.97,8470.728,8473.765,Just really briefly Madam chair.,334,,
1267,0.97,8473.765,8476.968,I appreciate Pedersen taking the lead on this.,334,,
1268,0.97,8476.968,8479.204,Supportive as well.,334,,
1269,0.97,8479.204,8493.318,I have a question as pertains to if the study for the transportation benefit district fees is perhaps more necessary.,334,,
1270,0.97,8493.318,8498.122,We have not really started that process under that authority yet.,334,,
1271,0.97,8498.122,8529.854,So I could--I just wonder if you can clarify if we need a study for the transportation district that I understand has a lot of different considerations that are separate from the Gma that we need to do similar work ongoing forward.,334,,
1272,0.97,8529.854,8546.738,"With the transportation benefit district authorized under the program, under the Tbd we would be starting essentially from scratch, that is because of the analysis that would need to be done from the program differs from the analysis that is done for the Gma program.",335,,
1273,0.97,8546.738,8554.245,Part of it has to do with the desire by Council to use a Tbd mechanism to fund ongoing maintenance.,335,,
1274,0.97,8554.245,8559.15,That is one of the--there are trade offs under either program.,335,,
1275,0.97,8559.15,8562.921,That is one of the benefits under the Tbd authority.,335,,
1276,0.97,8562.921,8583.441,"That revenue from that program can be used for more than capital improvements there is, there is, we are starting from square one with the Tbd study and the cost of that study is essentially a bit uncertain.",335,,
1277,0.97,8583.441,8603.428,"$450,000 represents a high end St--to my level investment to make sure that it sticks.",335,,
1278,0.97,8603.428,8620.511,"Just as a quick follow up on that, would it be accurate to then say that kind of regardless of where we are with the Gma fees we would have to do a study on this to pursue the transportation benefit district authority.",336,,
1279,0.97,8620.511,8625.683,Regards of where we are in the Gma process.,336,,
1280,0.97,8625.683,8631.189,"And, and then, regardless if that is the case or not.",336,,
1281,0.97,8631.189,8641.265,It would--would we--this number as I understand it represents the total cost of looking at both the transportation benefit district and the Gma.,336,,
1282,0.97,8641.265,8647.638,It is not like each of them would cost this much money.,336,,
1283,0.97,8647.638,8654.278,Combined this is what we estimate the whole study Footprint to be for impact fees under both authorities.,336,,
1284,0.97,8654.278,8659.083,"So, those are just the last two questions I would want to clarify.",336,,
1285,0.97,8659.083,8671.029,"And so, I am--you may have to restate the first part of the question but the response to the second part the $450 would fund both the answer to that is yes it would.",337,,
1286,0.97,8671.029,8676.801,If you can restate your first part of the question please?,337,,
1287,0.97,8676.801,8677.068,Yes.,338,,
1288,0.97,8677.068,8709.7,"So just in following up on your earlier Clarifications on this, what I heard you say I want to make sure I heard you correctly was regardless of where we currently stand in the process that Councilmember Herbold alluded to with the fees we are still in position that we are starting from scratch and need a study like this regardless where the Gma process is, is that the case?",338,,
1289,0.97,8709.7,8710.201,That is correct.,339,,
1290,0.97,8710.201,8734.358,Even in the case where Gma process is sort of where we want it to be and--I guess this is just another question would those measures be Severable in the sense that Gma process could continue along on the track that was set by previous councils while the transportation benefit district one is starting?,340,,
1291,0.97,8734.358,8737.862,The answer to that is yes.,341,,
1292,0.97,8737.862,8748.072,"We have had some initial discussions because of Tba impact fees, authorized by the state but no jurisdiction in Washington uses them.",341,,
1293,0.97,8748.072,8754.612,We had conversations about what it would look like mechanically and Procedurally.,341,,
1294,0.97,8754.612,8762.386,There is a tie between the fees and the Tbd fees that tie in would be for both we may need to amend the plan.,341,,
1295,0.97,8762.386,8771.963,We need to for the growth management fees but we may not for the Tbd fees but likely we would.,341,,
1296,0.97,8771.963,8776.701,The tie in is significant because it effects the timing when Council can act.,341,,
1297,0.97,8776.701,8782.406,The Council can only amend the plan once a year with some exceptions.,341,,
1298,0.97,8782.406,8793.384,While they are distinct they are constrained by potentially the same kind of procedural problems.,341,,
1299,0.97,8793.384,8793.651,Right.,342,,
1300,0.97,8793.651,8797.789,Totally understand but--I think we can follow up on this Offline.,342,,
1301,0.97,8797.789,8805.129,I maybe have a couple additional questions but I appreciate what we were able to get out there.,342,,
1302,0.97,8805.129,8820.578,I think it is important for considering this as we go town the line on how these two different fees interact and how the process could be Severable and how no matter what we do still need that new study for the transportation district one.,342,,
1303,0.97,8820.578,8830.254,I appreciate the questions and I will certainly be in touch on this one and Appreciature work on this.,342,,
1304,0.97,8830.254,8832.657,Councilmember Pedersen did you have last comments?,343,,
1305,0.97,8832.657,8835.126,Just excited about the interest in this.,344,,
1306,0.97,8835.126,8836.761,All right.,345,,
1307,0.97,8836.761,8837.862,Thank you.,346,,
1308,0.97,8837.862,8848.072,As well and thanks for summarizing this component.,346,,
1309,0.97,8848.072,8852.343,I see we have Seattle municipal court.,346,,
1310,0.97,8852.343,8864.455,"Council proposal would add $200,000 and two staff members.",347,,
1311,0.97,8868.326,8870.494,There is proposed by Councilmember Lewis.,347,,
1312,0.97,8870.494,8875.099,"Welcome, thank you, welcome back Councilmember Lewis would you like to speak to this one?",348,,
1313,0.97,8875.099,8877.235,I could not quite hear you just now.,349,,
1314,0.97,8877.235,8878.903,You tuned out a little bit.,349,,
1315,0.97,8878.903,8882.139,"Can you Queue it up again, I am sorry --",349,,
1316,0.97,8882.139,8882.573,Sure.,350,,
1317,0.97,8882.573,8883.908,No problem.,350,,
1318,0.97,8883.908,8896.153,"We are talking about the Seattle municipal courts add of $250,000 and two positions and supporting the resource center.",350,,
1319,0.97,8896.153,8897.221,"Great, thank you very much.",351,,
1320,0.97,8897.221,8906.097,I throughout we had a good presentation the other day from Seattle municipal court.,352,,
1321,0.97,8906.097,8923.114,"There is a lot of work they are doing to adapt their practices to be a lot more progressive and restorative, focus more on services and diverse instead of Incarceration and surveillance.",352,,
1322,0.97,8923.114,8948.472,The key part of that has been my office communicating with the court resource center throughout the year on some things that their staff has been seeking out and requesting that would be helpful to their mission to be successful and make sure the folks on their caseload have the tools that they Node for success.,352,,
1323,0.97,8948.472,8975.566,"You know, this position and these resources would go a long way to providing that and making sure that the court, the reforms the court is imposing can stick and can thrive and those in contact with the court do not have future contact with the court this is a position.",352,,
1324,0.97,8975.566,8977.034,It can make a big difference.,352,,
1325,0.97,8977.034,8989.313,Look forward to working on this over the next few weeks.,352,,
1326,0.97,8989.313,8990.314,"Ex excellent, Councilmember Lewis.",353,,
1327,0.97,8990.314,8997.521,The question that I have is how it fits in with the reforms that were presented and the reforms that are under taking.,354,,
1328,0.97,8997.521,9000.725,We got a bit of a walk through on that.,354,,
1329,0.97,9000.725,9004.328,"So, remind me how these two positions would fit into that?",354,,
1330,0.97,9004.328,9017.608,"So, the idea is that the coordination position would be a social worker helping people navigate through Seattle community court.",355,,
1331,0.97,9017.608,9031.655,"So, the community court is one of the newer things that has happened over 2020 to divert low-level Misdemeanors through that special court.",355,,
1332,0.97,9031.655,9038.229,"So, the coordinator is to work with those specific clients.",355,,
1333,0.97,9038.229,9047.838,Housing and employment coordinator is a request that would serve any priority excess for people going through community court but really anyone at the court to help them find access to housing.,355,,
1334,0.97,9047.838,9074.965,"One of the things that we discussed during I think when the court was presenting was an ask for reserved housing for people coming out of community court and so, rather than the next housing slot it would be a person that is helping to coordinate housing for people coming out of community court.",355,,
1335,0.97,9074.965,9076.1,"Okay, excellent.",356,,
1336,0.97,9076.1,9078.836,Councilmember Lewis anything else to add?,356,,
1337,0.97,9078.836,9091.115,"I would just add that, you know, it is in keeping with some of the observations of an audit that was requested by Council Gonzalez a few years ago at the court resource center.",357,,
1338,0.97,9091.115,9102.726,I do think under the current leadership of presiding judge Gregory it is something that is a little more integrated into what the mission ever the court is going to be.,357,,
1339,0.97,9102.726,9111.235,So it makes it a more pressing and common investment.,357,,
1340,0.97,9111.235,9114.772,In a lot of ways the court slid backwards.,357,,
1341,0.97,9114.772,9128.752,They used to have not only just sort of system navigators but they had dedicated housing resources particularly for the mental health specialty court.,357,,
1342,0.97,9128.752,9138.062,That in the last recession cut and never restored.,357,,
1343,0.97,9138.062,9147.238,It is a tall order to get them dedicated housing slots but it could be a good way to patch them in as another point of referral.,357,,
1344,0.97,9147.238,9157.882,So at the very least people have access to the general shelter and housing referral we have set up.,357,,
1345,0.97,9157.882,9170.294,"It is important, a priority for the judges and it is something that I think could end up making a big difference in a lot of the new practices they are trying to do.",357,,
1346,0.97,9170.294,9174.632,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Lewis.",358,,
1347,0.97,9174.632,9176.3,Thanks for that explanation.,358,,
1348,0.97,9176.3,9181.605,I don't see additional comments.,358,,
1349,0.97,9181.605,9183.674,Thank you.,358,,
1350,0.97,9183.674,9184.775,Okay.,359,,
1351,0.97,9184.775,9187.811,Let's move on to Opcd.,359,,

1354,0.97,9189.38,9201.058,So this is a proposal from chairman Mosqueda to repeat a 2020 item on the budget.,360,,
1355,0.97,9201.058,9212.636,"Funding was for plan, the funding was cut this summer because the state has moved deadlines for the city action back by a year.",360,,
1356,0.97,9212.636,9223.948,"And so the Mayor's proposed 2021 budget including funding, again, for kicking off the major update, the next major update to the comprehensive plan.",360,,
1357,0.97,9223.948,9245.369,This action would add Provisos to those funds and includes an alternative that looks at housing diversity in single family areas and other strategies for minimizing displacement for low income communities.,360,,
1358,0.97,9245.369,9254.178,"And, the Council has an opportunity to comment on that out reach and engagement strategy that would be part of that major update.",360,,
1359,0.97,9254.178,9254.478,Great.,361,,
1360,0.97,9254.478,9257.381,"So, thank you very much.",361,,
1361,0.97,9257.381,9263.988,"I will time myself, colleagues I have a lot to say on this topic and I will keep it to two minutes if I can.",361,,
1362,0.97,9263.988,9269.46,It is important to provide additional contests thank you for the summary as well.,361,,
1363,0.97,9269.46,9279.903,In the 2018 budget session I sponsored on the Council included a racial equity tool kit with the purpose of evaluating Seattle's Exclusionary policy.,361,,
1364,0.97,9279.903,9287.011,It was supposed to be initiated in 20--2019 and it was.,361,,
1365,0.97,9287.011,9288.045,The work is ongoing.,361,,
1366,0.97,9288.045,9303.827,Continues the work of the policies that restrict multifamily residential and mix used development to just 25% of Seattle's residential land leaving 75% of Seattle's residential land just to single family detached housing.,361,,
1367,0.97,9303.827,9314.004,The intent of the tool kit is to work towards making sure we create and stay on a path towards a more equity growth strategy.,361,,
1368,0.97,9314.004,9315.439,More inclusive Seattle.,361,,
1369,0.97,9315.439,9326.817,Last year we secured two growth adds passed during the Council's budget for fiscal year 2020.,361,,
1370,0.97,9326.817,9344.468,"First, proviso on the funding to require the EIS include a study of diversity including the two Plexes and Fourplexes A. to be pass inside 20 Hu23.",361,,
1371,0.97,9344.468,9346.737,Codifiying our 20 year growth in Seattle.,361,,
1372,0.97,9346.737,9354.344,A provision was secured on the community engagement funds for the tool kit on the Seattle growth strategy.,361,,
1373,0.97,9354.344,9363.921,Requiring presentation of a community engagement plan to ensure culturally responsive engagement on present day zoning.,361,,
1374,0.97,9363.921,9379.737,"These measures help to continue to lay the groundwork to write historic wrongs related to past policies like voices red lining, restrictive cover dense and increase in Exclusionary zoning we have seen over the past few decades.",361,,
1375,0.97,9379.737,9385.876,So we can create a inclusive zoning and growth in our city.,361,,
1376,0.97,9385.876,9398.255,-- to summarize in the 2020 rebalancing budget the COMP plan and EIS was cut anticipating the plan will be in 2024.,361,,
1377,0.97,9398.255,9416.006,"Now, funds for the EIS and community engagement were Reenstated in this year's budget and from that standpoint we need to Reenstate the Provisos as well.",361,,
1378,0.97,9416.006,9428.552,"An analysis for housing capacity and diversity including Duplexes, Tri-Plexes and Fourplexes.",361,,
1379,0.97,9428.552,9443.066,"Second, to develop strategies to minimize low income residents and communities of color and third, presentation to Council of community engagement plan and the tool kit progress so we are involved in the process as it unfolds.",361,,

1408,0.97,9579.036,9602.359,"This would direct them to consider specific alternatives including assessing the cost and benefits to the city and the Ratepayers, various changes in waste water treatment and the government as to the city owning its own facility so we can control the costs to our Ratepayers.",368,,

1427,0.97,9668.592,9676.6,"The tree Ambassador program allows volunteers to lead neighbors, neighborhood tree walks and work parties.",373,,
1428,0.97,9676.6,9700.457,This would ask to work with other departments expanding the program to include resident or citizen Arborists that can take on a greater role in protecting trees or Nurturing trees.,373,,

1475,0.97,9948.238,9959.549,The report would include a recommendations of changes to the system to meet either of the out comes of achieving 100% funding ratio.,386,,
1476,0.97,9959.549,9961.184,Assets equal to liabilities.,386,,
1477,0.97,9961.184,9970.06,Sooner than 2042 or decreasing the total retirement system costs.,386,,
1478,0.97,9970.06,9973.797,Thank you.,387,,
1479,0.97,9973.797,9975.031,Councilmember Pedersen go ahead.,387,,
1480,0.97,9975.031,9975.932,Thank you.,388,,
1481,0.97,9975.932,9983.406,This--these three items are related but I can address them all three right now.,388,,
1482,0.97,9983.406,9992.215,It is really just to provide more information to the general public about the retirement system and systems that we have.,388,,
1483,0.97,9992.215,9994.751,So it is asking for information.,388,,
1484,0.97,9994.751,10012.369,While we want city government employees to have access to retirement benefits from a sustainable retirement system I do have a concern that Seattle taxpayers pay an increasing amount to support the pension programs of our city government employees.,388,,
1485,0.97,10012.369,10015.305,"This, so, various statements of legislative intent.",388,,
1486,0.97,10015.305,10033.323,"The third one we will get to simply Quatifies, highlights these expenses paid by taxpayers so the general public is made more aware of the cost and the upward trend.",388,,
1487,0.97,10033.323,10040.897,We are conscious that every extra dollar paid by tax dollars to support the lifetime pension is money that could go to other urgent needs.,388,,
1488,0.97,10040.897,10047.17,We just want to daylight and track the trends here of the pension system that we do have.,388,,
1489,0.97,10047.17,10067.057,"Also when we talk, when we look at 2, it was put in place to try to get a more sustainable system for new employees there were five options presented to the administration and they picked, they sort of picked the low hanging fruit version of that.",388,,
1490,0.97,10067.057,10084.407,"It is still an expensive version and newer employees, what I am hoping in addition to Daylighting there information for will general public it may lead to a discussion do we want to look at other options for new employees, future employees.",388,,
1491,0.97,10084.407,10105.829,"We cannot change the pension and agreements in place on pensions but for new employees that may be more mobile, who may not be looking for a career for 20 or 30 years in local government but we want to attract the talent to the city government family they may want different options for their retirement.",388,,
1492,0.97,10105.829,10121.744,So it is all leading to just getting more information about something that is a big cost to the city and see figure we want to refine it even more.,388,,
1493,0.97,10121.744,10127.851,Councilmember Pedersen thank you very much for walking us through that.,389,,
1494,0.97,10127.851,10129.252,We hope you still have power.,389,,
1495,0.97,10129.252,10130.82,We will keep going here.,389,,
1496,0.97,10130.82,10133.022,Thank you for that summary.,389,,
1497,0.97,10133.022,10139.362,Are there any other questions for the Councilmember on this?,389,,
1498,0.97,10139.362,10154.31,"The question that comes to mind is in terms of getting the report, can you remind us when our report back to the Council would be made?",390,,
1499,0.97,10154.31,10154.577,Yes.,391,,
1500,0.97,10154.577,10156.546,We don't have a hard date on that.,391,,
1501,0.97,10156.546,10165.788,I was going to work with Tom on what might make sense and be practical from a workload standpoint.,391,,
1502,0.97,10165.788,10170.693,When we might combine these three items he will talk to the other two.,391,,
1503,0.97,10170.693,10176.199,We might combine them into one form B.,391,,
1504,0.97,10176.199,10177.4,Got it.,392,,
1505,0.97,10177.4,10177.667,Okay.,393,,
1506,0.97,10177.667,10177.967,Wonderful.,393,,
1507,0.97,10177.967,10184.908,Tom did you want to provide more context to items two and three?,393,,
1508,0.97,10184.908,10185.875,"Certainly, Madam chair.",394,,
1509,0.97,10185.875,10191.915,"Item 2, relates to the budget as proposed in June.",394,,
1510,0.97,10191.915,10204.727,"The board of administration voted to send a budget proposal that would not appropriate fees, so, the fund is $3 billion.",394,,
1511,0.97,10204.727,10220.443,That is managed by private investment companies and the fees that are paid are a function of that body of investment and the earnings thereof.,394,,
1512,0.97,10220.443,10248.771,So in a way not under control through appropriation and it is the proposed change in the budget and the proposal from Pedersen would add back the.,394,,
1513,0.97,10249.238,10263.82,"Madam chair, it is 1 and 2, item 2 that Tom just mention today is really how visually we present it.",395,,
1514,0.97,10263.82,10270.36,Right now it is for the fee and that makes it visible.,395,,
1515,0.97,10270.36,10272.462,There is no real net change.,395,,
1516,0.97,10272.462,10275.264,Just the visibility of having that line item in the budget.,395,,
1517,0.97,10275.264,10279.836,I think we should have greater transparency and detail in the budget.,395,,
1518,0.97,10279.836,10288.111,When we look at the budget right now it shows 2020 it shows the fee amount but then in 2021 it disappears.,395,,
1519,0.97,10288.111,10294.817,That caught my attention and thought why not provide greater detail.,395,,
1520,0.97,10294.817,10298.454,Would require change in the document.,395,,
1521,0.97,10298.454,10310.266,No net impact on actual appropriations.,395,,
1522,0.97,10310.266,10313.569,Thank you for walks us through that.,396,,
1523,0.97,10313.569,10315.438,And any additional information on item 3?,396,,
1524,0.97,10315.438,10336.292,I do not have anything more to add other than what Pedersen mentioned it is combined with number one in this case covering a period of 10 years for one and two.,397,,
1525,0.97,10336.292,10343.666,Excellent.,398,,
1526,0.97,10343.666,10345.668,Okay.,398,,
1527,0.97,10345.668,10348.171,Councilmember Pedersen coming more.,398,,
1528,0.97,10348.171,10348.738,"No, thank you.",399,,
1529,0.97,10348.738,10354.11,"I think we are in the last section, folks.",400,,
1530,0.97,10354.11,10358.281,"So, 3 more to go.",400,,
1531,0.97,10358.281,10361.15,And correct me if I am wrong.,400,,
1532,0.97,10361.15,10362.385,We are in citywide.,400,,
1533,0.97,10362.385,10371.694,Let's get through it and see if we can do it any questions.,400,,
1534,0.97,10371.694,10379.635,Central staff and on the last page of today's agenda page 28.,401,,
1535,0.97,10379.635,10392.315,First is from Madam chair and it would add $3.6 million to restore a position of authority due to layoffs for budget reasons as policy.,401,,
1536,0.97,10392.315,10407.296,Information from the city budget office indicates that about 23 of the 33 proposed layoffs fit in this category and central staff will work with the city budget office to Solitify the numbers.,401,,
1537,0.97,10407.296,10408.631,Thank you very much.,402,,
1538,0.97,10408.631,10412.935,Good to see you this Evening/Afternoon.,402,,
1539,0.97,10412.935,10423.045,Colleagues it is a very important form A. that we are submitting here.,402,,
1540,0.97,10423.045,10447.904,"We heard yesterday how our Jump- start proposal that we passed, the spend plan it was very detailed and we would of provided sufficient funding through the plan to stop cuts to essential services and contracts provides vital services to Seattle residents who are hurting right now while still allowing for there to be a surplus to use or invest back into the reserves.",402,,
1541,0.97,10447.904,10468.391,With the tough choices that the Mayor made we are seeing how some of those choices are resulting in harmful cuts including around 20 employees who were given layoff notices already based on the financial decisions that the Cvo and the Mayor's office have contemplated in the proposed Bundleet.,402,,
1542,0.97,10468.391,10477.333,They were not told they were being laid off because we took a look at the city's services and decided those lines of businesses don't need to continue.,402,,
1543,0.97,10477.333,10494.517,"In fact, in many cases they were given notices that they would not have a job next year, their home budgets could be effected by notices and the city services would be ended or absorbed somewhere else in the budget.",402,,
1544,0.97,10494.517,10499.589,That is what we are trying to address today.,402,,
1545,0.97,10499.589,10505.094,How can we soften this blow that we tried to stem with the funding that we passed earlier this year.,402,,
1546,0.97,10505.094,10510.166,We knew there was going to be potential layoff positions coming.,402,,
1547,0.97,10510.166,10517.54,"That is part of the reason we included the majority, 75% of the funds for next year.",402,,
1548,0.97,10517.54,10524.714,2021 or intended to go to soften the blow and to reduce the need for layoff decisions to move forward.,402,,
1549,0.97,10524.714,10537.86,And the choices that we have in front of us are to really figure out how we can prevent these Laylay offs from going forward.,402,,
1550,0.97,10537.86,10560.449,I am disappointed where the dollars we had initially planned to use to prevent layoffs are not used that way and again I am looking to the strategy that we have in front of us right now to pick up the pieces and ensure that our residents are well served and that we are not laying off these 27 employees.,402,,
1551,0.97,10560.449,10574.03,These are Seattle employees who have received their warn notices and I am sure we are sending notices to you.,402,,
1552,0.97,10574.03,10578.401,It is not a final budget yet.,402,,
1553,0.97,10578.401,10580.236,Not determined where the budget will go.,402,,
1554,0.97,10580.236,10587.944,I hope you hear that we are fighting to make sure these positions are addressed in this budget and that this it is not a flashy item.,402,,
1555,0.97,10587.944,10617.74,It is one that I think it is a responsible item for us to act as responsible employers and making sure we have those positions maintained and services that we talk about in many cases they are stepping beyond the call of duty and stepping into new roles to help those experiences the impacts of Covid-19.,402,,
1556,0.97,10617.74,10620.476,It is part of our longer term recovery.,402,,
1557,0.97,10620.476,10634.79,"If you will recall in the spring when we had a presentation on the impacts of previous recessions, the biggest Takeaway was that budget that engages in slashing employee positions creates longer harm.",402,,
1558,0.97,10634.79,10642.231,It is a longer recovery because you don't have those vital services for those slipping through the cracks.,402,,
1559,0.97,10642.231,10656.278,"With that, more work to do as noted to identify all of those positions and confirm but wanted to flag it as a big priority for me.",402,,
1560,0.97,10656.278,10658.681,Coming else?,403,,
1561,0.97,10658.681,10659.348,No.,404,,
1562,0.97,10659.348,10659.982,That covers it.,404,,
1563,0.97,10659.982,10663.686,Any questions colleagues?,405,,
1564,0.97,10663.686,10664.053,Okay.,405,,
1565,0.97,10664.053,10668.591,Not seeing questions on this.,405,,
1566,0.97,10668.591,10670.459,Councilmember Pedersen you are up next.,405,,
1567,0.97,10670.459,10686.308,"So, yes, this proposal is from Councilmember Pedersen and provide four options for generating savings in the budget by eliminating or reducing wage increases referred to you as Awis.",406,,
1568,0.97,10686.308,10698.287,"The options would align with the elimination of Awi's for Nonrepresentative executives, managers and advisories that are represented in the proposed budget.",406,,
1569,0.97,10698.287,10702.591,These would be a subject for Pargiping for employees.,406,,
1570,0.97,10702.591,10719.208,The four options that are on the memo on page 28 begin with option A. eliminating the 2021Awi.,407,,
1571,0.97,10719.208,10740.029,"The next, reducing it for all city employees and 1.9 is the consumer price index that would reflect the rate of inflation and not represent the additional 1% proposed as the Awi that is 2.9% for most city employees.",407,,
1572,0.97,10740.029,10751.707,Option city would eliminate a 2021Awi of 2.9% of all employees earning 60% or more of the Seattle median income.,407,,
1573,0.97,10751.707,10760.783,"That would mean that employees earning $62,000 more would not receive it but less would.",407,,
1574,0.97,10760.783,10779.201,"And then last is option D. that is in the same as option C. but it would eliminate a Awi of 2.9% for all city employees earning 80% of the median income that is $22,000 or more.",407,,
1575,0.97,10779.201,10786.775,There are some estimates of the savings generated by the options that are on the memo.,407,,
1576,0.97,10786.775,10802.825,They are preliminary ballpark estimates that I will continue to work with the city budget office to further refine.,407,,
1577,0.97,10802.825,10805.027,Excellent.,408,,
1578,0.97,10805.027,10805.528,Councilmember Pedersen.,408,,
1579,0.97,10805.528,10834.69,"We wanted to do the research and put the ideas into the mix of things as we try to Prioritize our investments and so yesterday I mentioned this, I tried to present it as an opportunity to redeploy millions of dollars for example shelter those experiencing homelessness, to invest in Seattle's communities, to fix our crumbling bridges.",409,,
1580,0.97,10834.69,10841.063,Seattle government employees received rages in 2019 and 2020.,409,,
1581,0.97,10841.063,10853.943,We can still get more money out the door to vulnerable getting the plan out.,409,,
1582,0.97,10853.943,10863.852,When so many people are out of jobs it is not the right time to increase the pay of city employees again.,409,,
1583,0.97,10863.852,10879.702,This proposal on page 28 of the memo offers different options ranging from $15 million to $42 million by erasing that.,409,,
1584,0.97,10879.702,10882.004,I would encourage folks to consider this.,409,,
1585,0.97,10882.004,10899.088,"The opportunity to reinvest millions for additional shelter, mental supports, safety of our bridges, investing in these things rather than putting the money back in the city government pockets.",409,,
1586,0.97,10899.088,10899.388,Thank you.,409,,
1587,0.97,10899.388,10900.723,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",410,,
1588,0.97,10900.723,10905.027,Not seeing and questions and thank you for flagging it yesterday.,410,,
1589,0.97,10905.027,10910.232,So folks perhaps got a chance to hear about it yesterday and their questions answered.,410,,
1590,0.97,10910.232,10915.17,Let's go ahead to the last one.,410,,
1591,0.97,10915.17,10919.174,Councilmember Pedersen you will close us out.,410,,
1592,0.97,10919.174,10924.213,I think this one belongs to Tom.,411,,
1593,0.97,10924.213,10931.553,This is on page 28 of the memo.,412,,
1594,0.97,10931.553,10950.739,It is a Councilmember Pedersen on increase proposed on the budget or proposed increase to off set that increase with a decrease in the city sales tax rate.,412,,
1595,0.97,10950.739,10957.613,With the intent to introduce progressive system by way of Impacting or making a reduction to the sales tax rate.,412,,
1596,0.97,10957.613,10965.487,Thank you very much.,413,,
1597,0.97,10965.487,10965.721,Tom.,413,,
1598,0.97,10965.721,10967.523,Councilmember Pedersen?,413,,
1599,0.97,10967.523,10968.29,Thank you.,414,,
1600,0.97,10968.29,10971.593,This form A. was put together without knowing what others would be.,414,,
1601,0.97,10971.593,10973.262,This may not need to move forward.,414,,
1602,0.97,10973.262,10993.315,The concept is if we were going to put forward new progressive revenues either established by us or if something happened with state government or county government this statement of intent would signal our strong interest in also partially reducing aggressive taxes.,414,,
1603,0.97,10993.315,10997.019,The focus on the sales tax collected by the city.,414,,
1604,0.97,10997.019,11001.557,"It is, I believe, 1% of the 10.1% sales tax.",414,,
1605,0.97,11001.557,11016.538,We would still want to retain a net increase in the city treasure if we had new aggressive means.,414,,
1606,0.97,11016.538,11034.356,But it would be less Regressive this may not be necessary to move forward if there are flow additional progressive revenues proposed at there time since we just did implement the new payroll tax.,414,,
1607,0.97,11034.356,11037.826,Thank you.,414,,
1608,0.97,11037.826,11040.729,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen questions?,415,,
1609,0.97,11040.729,11086.708,"I just want to express my appreciation for remembering that one of our proposed progressive revenue measures, the high earners income tax included a commitment that if we were to implement an income tax we made a commitment to reduce other more Regressive forms of taxation and I think there is some questions in we would be seeing a proposed income tax in light of the fact that the courts have authorized the city to do a flat income tax.",416,,
1610,0.97,11086.708,11087.109,Appreciate that.,416,,
1611,0.97,11087.109,11092.781,Perhaps it was proposed in preparation for a proposal in that area.,416,,
1612,0.97,11092.781,11097.352,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Herbold.",417,,
1613,0.97,11097.352,11101.19,Any additional comments on this item?,417,,
1614,0.97,11101.19,11102.891,Yes.,418,,
1615,0.97,11102.891,11108.43,"This, this may just be a more of a question for central staff.",418,,
1616,0.97,11108.43,11120.909,"To what extent does the city just given that we are in this Multilayered system of County, city, state when it comes to sales tax as a source.",418,,
1617,0.97,11120.909,11127.916,How can we act as the Council and city government decrease sales tax?,418,,
1618,0.97,11127.916,11134.957,This is certainly something I am interested in.,418,,
1619,0.97,11134.957,11141.663,Tax equity including aggressive taxes.,418,,
1620,0.97,11141.663,11143.265,I would be curious to know.,418,,
1621,0.97,11143.265,11147.769,What is the extent we could reduce it?,418,,
1622,0.97,11147.769,11150.706,I know Pedersen talked about what is currently remitted.,418,,
1623,0.97,11150.706,11164.019,I wonder if some of that is locked up in like levy commitments or maybe a portion of another jurisdiction sales tax that we collect and remit.,418,,
1624,0.97,11164.019,11169.892,Just want to--just curious what the answer to that would be?,418,,
1625,0.97,11169.892,11173.061,Thank you for the question Councilmember Lewis.,419,,
1626,0.97,11173.061,11181.97,The overall level of sales tax charged for transactions in the city is 10.1%.,420,,
1627,0.97,11181.97,11185.607,The city of Seattle is about 3% of that.,420,,
1628,0.97,11185.607,11192.414,"Though, only 1% of that goes to the city's general fund.",420,,
1629,0.97,11192.414,11198.554,The other pieces to other funds and support services for those funds.,420,,
1630,0.97,11198.554,11208.23,Of the 1% .15 is retained by King County for administrative costs of implementing the tax.,420,,
1631,0.97,11208.23,11222.744,"So, I believe it is--it is flexible although I think the intent is, the 1% that Councilmember refers to is the general fund piece.",420,,
1632,0.97,11222.744,11232.454,So that is I think what we are talking about here.,420,,
1633,0.97,11232.454,11237.96,"Excellent, Councilmember Pedersen anything to add to that?",421,,
1634,0.97,11237.96,11241.463,"No, thank you.",422,,
