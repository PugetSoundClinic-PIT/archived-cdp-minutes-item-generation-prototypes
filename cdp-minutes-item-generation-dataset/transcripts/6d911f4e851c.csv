56,0.97,372.939,374.54,Speaking on our field police accountability system.,6,,
57,0.97,374.54,386.052,"In order to SPD disciplinary system was released last week by the Seattle office of Inspector general, the Oig.",6,,
58,0.97,386.052,389.355,This is the same office that is embroiled in controversy and failures of oversight.,6,,
59,0.97,389.355,406.372,"As revealed by two Oig Whistleblowers, and documented in 16, 16 investigations published by Carolyn Beck in the South Seattle Emerald over the course of this year, and an investigation last month.",6,,
60,0.97,406.372,409.675,What is revealed in these investigations is a failure of oversight by Oig for a reason.,6,,
61,0.97,409.675,417.884,"That the investigations they oversee, investigations done by the OPA, are severely and sometimes irreparably followed.",6,,
62,0.97,417.884,431.597,"The OPA director has judged nearly 90% of last year's police abuse cases reviewed without merit, and has found every single SPD killing that they investigated to be quote, lawful and proper.",6,,
63,0.97,431.597,446.345,"We have learned that the director of the office of Inspector General has allowed the routine certification of these flawed OPA investigations by a person who formerly had a 23 year career as a police officer, without even looking at evidence and sometimes without even reviewing the investigations.",6,,
64,0.97,446.345,452.151,"We recently have discovered that this individual is still working at the Oig, and still certifying investigations.",6,,
65,0.97,452.151,466.966,"We have learned that the director of the Oig has encouraged investigators to ignore OPA investigatory failures, and has worked diligently to undercut the public records act by mandating that employees not put complaints or concerns in writing.",6,,
66,0.97,466.966,470.87,"Despite this, we are trusting the Oig to evaluate the SPD disciplinary system.",6,,
67,0.97,470.87,480.346,A system which is can barely compromise giving that the barely investigations that would provide the basis for discipline are so flood.,6,,
68,0.97,480.346,488.087,"All this evidence points to the critical need for a system that provides full civilian community control over police policy, misconduct investigations, and disciplines.",6,,
69,0.97,488.087,492.391,Go to Seattle stopped at work to find out how.,6,,
70,0.97,492.391,493.392,That is Seattle Stop.Org.,6,,

76,0.97,515.481,517.316,Thank you.,8,,
77,0.97,517.316,518.584,Good morning.,8,,
78,0.97,518.584,519.118,David Haynes.,8,,
79,0.97,519.118,526.192,It's highly offensive that six cops and a bunch of others quit on the people of Seattle.,8,,
80,0.97,526.192,530.129,Endangering us with a lack of public safety efforts.,8,,
81,0.97,530.129,534.834,Only to see the same cops return to get another sign on bonus.,8,,
82,0.97,534.834,541.073,"Proving cops in modern time aren't fighting crime, they want to get rich at our expense.",8,,
83,0.97,541.073,545.411,"We don't need 27 year veteran's who are already burned out, and not actually fighting crime.",8,,
84,0.97,545.411,548.748,"Secondly, I live in Pioneer square.",8,,
85,0.97,548.748,565.164,"There are Crackheads and crack pushers and methods who reclaimed the front entrance to my apartment, Pioneer square at 601St Avenue, and across the street at the most nuisance 711.",8,,
86,0.97,565.164,568.668,A few days ago I was forced to call the cops because they would let anybody pass.,8,,
87,0.97,568.668,569.268,The drug pushers.,8,,
88,0.97,569.268,571.137,Inside Pioneer square.,8,,
89,0.97,571.137,575.474,"And the cop gets there, they don't address any crime.",8,,
90,0.97,575.474,578.978,They make me come out and identify myself as the one who called the cops.,8,,
91,0.97,578.978,580.846,During that time there's all these criminals pointing at me.,8,,
92,0.97,580.846,587.386,"When the cop addressed me, they told me, we got our body camera on, you're being recorded.",8,,
93,0.97,587.386,594.56,"The first thing they do is cross their arms, look at me Disdainfully and say you have call this over 12 times for the exact same thing.",8,,
94,0.97,594.56,597.463,And I said that's because you haven't done anything and it has gotten worse.,8,,
95,0.97,597.463,599.899,"So, the cop tells me, maybe you should just move.",8,,
96,0.97,599.899,601.968,I wish I could.,8,,
97,0.97,601.968,607.707,I think maybe I need to see the cops because they are not doing their job down here.,8,,
98,0.97,607.707,617.583,"There are some businesses down in Pioneer square, are lying to the press and the media, claiming that it is safer because they don't see the tents.",8,,
99,0.97,617.583,620.019,They just care about the front entrance to their building.,8,,
100,0.97,620.019,622.488,They don't care about the committee at large.,8,,
101,0.97,622.488,624.79,They don't ever address the evil drug pushers.,8,,
102,0.97,624.79,626.993,They just complain about it to somebody else.,8,,
103,0.97,626.993,639.939,"So now, every night, between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m., all these people are waking me up and they are trying to break into my building and it's impossible to live in Seattle.",8,,
104,0.97,639.939,643.809,We need to boycott the city until you stop all exempting the criminals.,8,,
105,0.97,643.809,649.815,"Thank you, David.",9,,
106,0.97,649.815,652.652,None of our last two speakers are showing as not present.,9,,
107,0.97,652.652,657.657,Yvette and the other one.,9,,
108,0.97,657.657,666.832,I'll pause for a second to make sure neither of them are going to come on to utilize public comment.,9,,
109,0.97,666.832,670.97,Not seeing any change in status.,9,,
110,0.97,670.97,678.878,"With that, we will conclude the portion of our agenda and go into public comment.",10,,
111,0.97,678.878,687.286,Moving on to our set of bills.,11,,

124,0.97,750.649,755.421,Moving on to committee reports.,18,,
125,0.97,755.421,758.357,"Item 1, will the clerk please read item 1 into the record.",18,,
126,0.97,758.357,766.732,"Agenda item 1, council bill 120213.",19,,
127,0.97,766.732,797.963,"An ordinance relating to land use and zoning, extending for six months a moratorium established by ordinance 125764, and extended by ordinances 126006, 126090, 126241, and 126362, on the filing, acceptance, processing and/or approval of any application to establish a new principal or accessory use, or change a principal or accessory use, for any site currently used as a mobile home park as defined in section 23.84A.032 of the Seattle municipal code.",19,,
128,0.97,797.963,800.799,Thank you very much.,20,,
129,0.97,800.799,811.043,"Before I open the court hearing on this item, I'm going to turn it over to Councilmember Strauss as the sponsor of the bill, to provide us with some introductory remarks.",20,,
130,0.97,811.043,817.683,"Thank you, Council President pro Tem Herbold.",21,,
131,0.97,817.683,825.624,This legislation extends the existing moratorium on the redevelopment of any of Seattle's remaining mobile home or better known as manufactured home parks.,21,,
132,0.97,825.624,840.239,"There are currently two remaining manufactured home parks in Seattle, boast in district 5. this moratorium was first adopted by the city council in early 2019, in response to a concern that one of the manufactured home parks may be Redeveloped.",21,,
133,0.97,840.239,845.811,"The moratorium has been extended four times since then, with this being the fifth and final extension.",21,,
134,0.97,845.811,857.756,"Earlier this year when we adopted the fourth extension, Councilmember Juarez and I shared that we had a proposal to enact long-term protections so that we can stop doing the short term moratoriums.",21,,
135,0.97,857.756,866.765,"Unfortunately over the summer, that proposal was challenged to the hearing Examiner, delaying its consideration.",21,,
136,0.97,866.765,876.976,"The land use and neighborhoods committee held an initial briefing on the long-term proposal this last Friday, and plans to hold a public hearing and vote on this Wednesday before sending the legislation.",21,,
137,0.97,876.976,880.679,"This final, permanent legislation, to full council next week.",21,,
138,0.97,880.679,890.589,"One of the aspects of this delay was that rather than going to court, we were able, Councilmember Juarez led the effort, we were able to avoid court by just compromise and consensus.",21,,
139,0.97,890.589,892.358,It was great.,21,,
140,0.97,892.358,907.706,"That said, because the delay occurred to the final legislation, the current moratorium is expiring January 10th, and there will be about a one week gap between the current moratorium expiring, and the long-term protections taking effect.",21,,
141,0.97,907.706,915.08,So this last moratorium extension before us today should sunset when the long- term protections take effect.,21,,
142,0.97,915.08,925.624,I ask that we extend this moratorium one final time to prevent any loopholes before our long-awaited long-term protections can be adopted by the city council next week.,21,,
143,0.97,925.624,927.226,"Thank you, Council President pro Tem.",21,,
