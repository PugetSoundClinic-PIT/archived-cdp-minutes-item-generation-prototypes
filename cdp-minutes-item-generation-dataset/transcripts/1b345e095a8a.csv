16,0.97,64.998,66.866,"Really quickly, I will go through the Presidents reports.",9,,
17,0.97,66.866,71.171,I am excited to announce that today marks the return of public comment to the city council meeting on this afternoon.,9,,
18,0.97,71.171,90.423,"We will test out our new virtual public comment system for the very first time . So in order to participate in public comment, people will he need to sign up in the advanced, so I want to repeat that.",9,,
19,0.97,90.423,94.527,"If you want to give public testimony this afternoon at 2 o'clock, you must register in advance of the meeting.",9,,
20,0.97,94.527,96.629,That registration page is available on the city council's Website.,9,,
21,0.97,96.629,109.709,"This registration page will go live today at 12 PM noon, so do not bother going there to the Website now to Preregister, you cannot register until noon.",9,,
22,0.97,109.709,114.547,That is 12 PM today.,9,,
23,0.97,114.547,117.851,That is exactly 2 hours before the start of our full council meeting at 2:00 PM.,9,,
24,0.97,117.851,128.661,"You can find the link to this page via the meeting agenda, or through one of the city council social media channels that will be actively pushing out this information to the general public today.",9,,
25,0.97,128.661,157.857,"So I will provide more detailed description of how this public comment process will work at 2 PM, but if you have any questions about public comment before the meeting begins today at 2 o'clock, I would ask that you contact me, my staff for, excuse me, the staff or one of the many Department employees that were busy at work over the last couple of weeks, and this weekend it to make virtual public comment possible.",9,,
26,0.97,157.857,180.78,"I want to take a moment to thank those legislative Department employees, Eric, Ian Smith, Elizabeth, and Joseph all played an important role in making sure that we were going to be ready for this afternoon's virtual public comment tool deployment.",9,,
27,0.97,180.78,186.119,I am grateful for all of their hard work to make it possible and available to the Council into the public.,9,,
28,0.97,186.119,218.551,"I do want to take a moment to note that this public comment tool is important and I remain committed to Reintegrating public comments into our meetings, but I will note that I am going to ask for everybody to be really patient because this is the first time we will use it, so it is a bit of a live test run of this new and optional system.",9,,
29,0.97,218.551,221.12,There may be some hiccups as we roll it out.,9,,
30,0.97,221.12,278.945,"While I remain, while it remains my intent to have public comment regularly included, I want to make sure that folks understand that if the tool is abused or not used for its intended purpose, then we will eliminate the public comment periods for meetings either full county or committee meetings in the future we are using a zoom platform and we have heard some stories about how zoom can be hacked or otherwise misused by the projection or plane of everything from pornographic material to other inappropriate materials and substance and matters, so that is not going to be tolerated.",9,,
31,0.97,278.945,281.614,"Of course, this is again a new tool.",9,,
32,0.97,281.614,295.528,"It is still optional and we are going to do the best to make it work well for us and for the public, but we do expect that the public will respect the tool and use the tool as it is intended.",9,,
33,0.97,295.528,299.632,Otherwise we will have to make the difficult decision of terminating a program.,9,,
34,0.97,299.632,314.28,"So that is my Presidents report, and we will go ahead and leave the floor so we can go ahead and transition into our presentation.",9,,
35,0.97,314.28,319.152,This presentation is allotted to go from 9:30 A.M.,9,,
36,0.97,319.152,320.253,Until 10:15.,9,,
37,0.97,320.253,322.221,It is now 9:38.,9,,
38,0.97,322.221,338.571,So I am going to go ahead and hand it over to her bolt and Peterson to give us introductory remarks and we will hand it over to the folks at Us.To kick off the presentation.,9,,
39,0.97,338.571,342.041,We will end this presentation at about 10:15 A.M.,9,,
40,0.97,342.041,344.377,This morning.,9,,
41,0.97,344.377,347.547,Thank you.,10,,
42,0.97,347.547,358.891,"Excuse me, good morning . I want to thank as stop for joining us this morning with another of what will be regular updates to that counsel.",10,,
43,0.97,358.891,377.009,"I know the future of the West Seattle bridge is one of the concerns about the future, concerns that my colleagues share . I want to also thank us.",10,,
44,0.97,377.009,389.021,"For the time they spent with Councilmember Peterson and I last week to a visit of the bridge that helped us visualize some of the problems, in particular the problem of the locked bearing.",10,,
45,0.97,389.021,406.839,"In the big picture, my concerns are of course always first and foremost safety, but also I feel that we really need to state laser focused on the need to maximize mobility for West Seattle residents.",10,,
46,0.97,406.839,417.049,"We often joke that West Seattle, which is a Peninsula feels more like an island sometimes, and that has never been more true than now.",10,,
47,0.97,417.049,468.868,"And I really hope that Councilmember Peterson, with his sharing of the transportation committee and my efforts as the representative for district one that we can bring a real sense of urgency to the need to again identify both not just real time traffic mobility plans for this moment, but also as we move into next stages and also work together to come up with a plan that represents the best thought out options as it relates to budget and mobility.",10,,
48,0.97,468.868,507.24,"The presentation we are going to hear from Sdot is going to cover the issues related to safety Prioritization, the future of the bridge, Stabilization and showing the schedule for those things, the creation of a technical advisory panel, then need again, as I mentioned earlier for traffic negation, both as it relates to the low bridge to the Detour routes and the transit and then finally the budget for the elements that we are planning moving forward and beyond.",10,,
49,0.97,507.24,517.016,"I also want to announce that this Wednesday from 5-6, we are going to have a district one town hall.",10,,
50,0.97,517.016,522.655,Presenters from Sdot are being confirmed and Ryan has graciously agreed to moderate.,10,,
51,0.97,522.655,526.359,"With that, I turn it over to",10,,
52,0.97,526.359,528.761,Thank you.,11,,
53,0.97,528.761,530.963,Good morning everybody.,11,,
54,0.97,530.963,582.114,"Just want to reinforce what the Councilmember was saying, that we will be really focused on safety, urgency, mobility with a general oversight role that we have as city Council, and this also brings up the importance in terms of mobility and transportation options for Adiam Emery that they are having a tough time right now because of this closure, just so you know on top of mind for me is renewing the Seattle transportation benefit district so we can provide additional bus service to West Seattle residents.",11,,
55,0.97,582.114,591.557,"We will talk more about that in the coming weeks, but I intend to work closely with the Council members, support her leadership for her constituents and also work closely with Seattle Department of transportation and we are happy they are here to give us another reports.",11,,
56,0.97,591.557,595.728,We really appreciate this frequent communication with them and their transparency.,11,,
57,0.97,595.728,596.062,Thank you.,11,,
58,0.97,596.062,596.429,Thank you.,12,,
59,0.97,596.429,597.229,We appreciate that.,12,,
60,0.97,597.229,600.633,We are going to hear now from the Seattle Department of transportation.,12,,
61,0.97,600.633,604.937,Director Zimbabwe will kick us off.,12,,
62,0.97,604.937,623.856,"Colleagues, as a reminder, if you have questions, you can use the chat function to just tell me you have a question and back and let me know if at what point you and to ask a question, that would be helpful.",12,,
63,0.97,623.856,653.185,"Do not use the chat function for anything that is substantive, do not put your questions in the chat function, just use it for the transitory purpose of letting me know that you are raising your hand and then Councilmember warrants, since you are not Online, if you have a question, just feel free to ping me on my phone and let me know that you have a question.",12,,
64,0.97,653.185,656.689,"With that, I am going to hand it over to director Zimbabwe.",12,,
65,0.97,656.689,666.932,Thank you.,13,,
66,0.97,667.767,679.111,"I will say that I am going to walk through most of the presentation and I will turn it over to Heather, who has joined me as well to talk about some of the mitigation aspects that we are putting in place now.",13,,
67,0.97,679.111,702.668,"So let me just start by saying there is never a good time to close a bridge and I want to briefly thank everyone at Sdot who in the midst of the public health crisis continue to be out there taking the safety of the traveling public first in mind, and identified accelerating Clacking of the West Seattle bridge, and that led us to the difficult decision to close its back on March 23.",13,,
68,0.97,702.668,731.931,"We know that this has been a major impact to people throughout Seattle, but particularly those in West Seattle, and I just want to say as we start this presentation, as we continue to be clear and transparent in our communications out we share your frustration about where we are right now, and I am a West Seattle resident myself.",13,,
69,0.97,731.931,754.253,"Many other people throughout Sdot are West Seattle residents and we feel this closure ourselves personally, but we also feel it professionally, and we know this is adding stress and frustration to people at an already difficult time for all of us.",13,,
70,0.97,754.253,780.412,"I want to make very clear as we go through what is still challenging information, and a lot of things where need more information to be able to provide the public with clarity on where things will go from here, please know that everybody at Sdot, the Mayor, all of our partners at all levels will continue to work to identify the best possible path forward and mitigate the impacts of this closure.",13,,
71,0.97,780.412,782.314,I know we only have about half an hour left.,13,,
72,0.97,782.314,792.024,"I will go through quickly that presentation, and we can go on to the next slide.",13,,
73,0.97,792.024,798.33,Councilmember Herbolt laid out what we will be talking about.,13,,
74,0.97,798.33,802.601,"Just what has changed in the last few weeks, where we are in the process and then where we are going.",13,,
75,0.97,802.601,814.146,So I will jump into just the background of what has changed and I know some people are joining this process a little bit down the line.,13,,
76,0.97,814.146,821.921,"We were here a week after we closed the bridge on March 30, talking with you.",13,,
77,0.97,821.921,853.085,"We are now back a few weeks later giving some updates, but when we presented on March 30, we talked about what God has here and we have also been updating our dedicated Website to the bridge . If people are just catching up, there is a lot of information I would encourage people to take a look at.",13,,
78,0.97,853.085,874.306,"We want to be very clear that during our frequent inspections of the bridge, there was no indication that the bridge was unsafe for ordinary use or that is a tentative maintenance plans would impact the normal use of the bridge until recently and that started and accelerated over the course of February and March.",13,,
79,0.97,874.306,887.72,We have been inspecting the bridge every year since 2013 and it really was not clear until recently that it would impact the normal use of the bridge and do so in such a dramatic way.,13,,
80,0.97,887.72,917.65,"We can move on to the next slide and just to reiterate, I think we have all said it so far that priority . Ains our number one it is still our assessment, and we have seen cracks continue to grow since we closed the bridge to traffic, but they had grown at a decelerating rate.",13,,
81,0.97,917.65,925.057,They have not continued to accelerate in the same way we were seeing while there was still traffic on the bridge.,13,,
82,0.97,925.057,952.117,"It is still our assessment that the bridge is not at imminent risk of failure, but before anybody goes up on the bridge, before we do daily inspections, we make sure that that is safe to continue to do so and we also know that we need to plan for every contingency with this bridge.",13,,
83,0.97,952.117,963.495,So we are working now to model those potential cracking scenarios and preparing our contingency plans in the event that we do think the bridge is at imminent risk of failure.,13,,
84,0.97,963.495,967.7,We know how we will proceed in an orderly fashion.,13,,
85,0.97,967.7,978.377,"We are also installing and have people up on the bridge right now, intelligent systems that can track the bridge in Real- time.",13,,
86,0.97,978.377,1025.824,"We have been inspecting the bridge every day in person, but that is a moment in time, and we started last week and over the course of the next few weeks, we will be installing sensors throughout the bridge that help us understand in Real- time what is happening, provide a lot more information into but is going on with the deterioration of the bridge and that informs our emergency planning and also our future planning and helps us have the information necessary to know what type of repair is possible and whether the bridge is deteriorating more quickly than we think right now.",13,,
87,0.97,1025.824,1027.693,Our safety management is based on a Worst-Case scenario.,13,,
88,0.97,1027.693,1058.891,"We will always plan for the worst case, hoping we do not get there, but being prepared in the event we do, and we continue, this information we are going to get from real-time monitoring systems that will help us understand and have as much lead time as possible if things start to go towards failure.",13,,
89,0.97,1058.891,1065.264,"Part of that is also outreach to other local Stakeholders, the port, the Coast Guard, adjacent property owners, that is beginning now.",13,,
90,0.97,1065.264,1073.972,Understanding what potential failures would look like and how we keep the public safe overall.,13,,
91,0.97,1073.972,1084.917,We can move on . I want to reiterate again that the future of the bridge right now remains uncertain.,13,,
92,0.97,1084.917,1094.293,Hold on a minute.,14,,
93,0.97,1094.293,1095.127,We have a question.,14,,
94,0.97,1095.127,1095.627,Thank you.,15,,
95,0.97,1095.627,1098.931,I think it is less of a question and more of a raising of an issue.,15,,
96,0.97,1098.931,1111.743,"I appreciate director Zimbabwe, I, focus on safety and the development of plans, contingency plans to address the Worst-Case scenario of bridge collapse.",15,,
97,0.97,1111.743,1139.738,"One of the messages that you sent out over the weekend relates specifically to the plans that you are developing in case areas around the Highbridge and you say and not Email that you are prepared to remove traffic from the low bridge and surrounding areas underneath . The bridge, for some period of time in the event that the Highridge bridge becomes unstable.",15,,
98,0.97,1139.738,1155.487,"Of course, as you rightly know, this affects everybody traveling around the bridge is, those who live and work near the structures and our team to work on the bridge itself.",15,,
99,0.97,1155.487,1157.956,I appreciate that this is a necessary part of contingency planning.,15,,
100,0.97,1157.956,1198.23,"I want to also flag that I really appreciate that you will be delivering a report on first Responder capability to address fire needs and this time and I want to flag that I think it is important that the impacts on prior to searching 36 is near the bridge be a part of this contingency planning as well, should there be a need in a Worst-Case scenario to close the lower level bridge.",15,,
101,0.97,1198.23,1200.732,Absolutely.,16,,
102,0.97,1200.732,1216.548,"I think those are great points, and the chief and I are in a regular conversation about the bridge and about our work on it and we have already started talking about what some of those challenges are that they face.",16,,
103,0.97,1216.548,1245.177,"The fire Department is highly involved in our contingency planning and there is both not only for the area immediately around the bridge, but some of the other Detour routes and areas where they will see some increased traffic as a result of the Highbridge closer, also impact other stations beyond just 36, but that is very tightly being coordinated.",16,,
104,0.97,1245.177,1245.877,I appreciate that.,17,,
105,0.97,1245.877,1274.506,"I am adding a request, and I understand because I have had communications that they are doing that work as it relates to the current situation on the ground, and doing an assessment of the fire Department's ability to address emergencies . What I am asking is will that work also be done as it relates to the Worst-Case scenario?",17,,
106,0.97,1274.506,1276.375,The lower level bridge?,17,,
107,0.97,1276.375,1278.577,It is.,18,,
108,0.97,1278.577,1281.079,And we will continue to do that.,18,,
109,0.97,1281.079,1302.734,"So I think we were starting on the future of the bridge remaining uncertain and I think this is an important point here, and we made it very clear we are committed to consistent communication even when we do not have all of the information we need to provide the full range of answers that people are looking for.",18,,
110,0.97,1302.734,1313.378,We do not yet know if the repair of the bridge is feasible from a technical or financial perspective.,18,,
111,0.97,1313.378,1331.596,"If it is feasible, we think it could provide up to 10 years of additional light to the bridge but in either case, we think we need to replace the rest Seattle Highridge bridge much sooner . This was information we shared last week, but we think it is important to reiterate.",18,,
112,0.97,1331.596,1338.07,We do not anticipate traffic returning to the bridge in 2020 or 2021 at this point.,18,,
113,0.97,1338.07,1365.097,"There is a few stages of what it will take to extend the life of the bridge and bring traffic back, and I want to talk about each of those because I think it is important for the public to understand the complexity of some of this work, but also what we are doing over the course of the next couple of years.",18,,
114,0.97,1365.097,1382.814,"So no matter what is decided about the future of the West Seattle Highbridge, shoring and stabilization of the bridge has to happen to preserve the integrity of the bridge and protect the public safety.",18,,
115,0.97,1382.814,1403.835,"We need to address the continued growth of cracks and the cracks have continued to grow even after we have removed live load from the bridge, and stabilize it to provide us the opportunity to make a decision.",18,,
116,0.97,1403.835,1417.516,"None of the work that we are doing now Precludes any choice that we make in terms of how we think about the future of the bridge, but for public safety purposes, we need to continue with Stabilization and shortening of the bridge.",18,,
117,0.97,1417.516,1423.355,"Right now, I mentioned we have been doing field inspections.",18,,
118,0.97,1423.355,1427.759,"We are installing the instrumentation hardware, provides us real-time alerts.",18,,
119,0.97,1427.759,1438.637,We are working on something I will talk about about the release of tension and a bearing at Pier 18.,18,,
120,0.97,1438.637,1466.498,"We will talk about what that means, then we will begin on repair of shoring and repair and bring together what Herbolt said earlier, peer review, some outside experts on the technical side that can help us, help all of us understand what is going on and best ways to move forward.",18,,
121,0.97,1466.498,1481.213,Later this summer we would begin to address the bearing issue at Pier 18 and begin procurement of shoring materials.,18,,
122,0.97,1481.213,1487.185,"And then after that, everything we are talking about here is through the shoring period.",18,,
123,0.97,1487.185,1507.272,"At the same time, as we are doing more of that work, we will have a better understanding of what repair is possible, what our Pathway towards repair would look like, but also be considering what the long-term future of the bridge is and whether early replacement is a more frequent path.",18,,
124,0.97,1507.272,1515.013,"Before you move on, we had a question about slide six.",19,,
125,0.97,1515.013,1518.149,You are so on mute.,20,,
126,0.97,1518.149,1536.334,What I hear you saying is that all of the items on this schedule up through early spring 2021 must be completed regardless of whether or not we are going to repair this bridge or rebuild it.,21,,
127,0.97,1536.334,1539.17,Is that correct?,21,,
128,0.97,1539.17,1577.409,"That is correct . I think we need to build on the Pathway that all of these things need to happen . at the same time as we are doing some of the design work around shoring, we will have a better understanding of whether and if repair is possible, and understand what our long-term future is and whether early replacement, whether passing over a repair step and just thinking about replacement is a more prudent path.",22,,
129,0.97,1577.409,1584.182,So this is not a fixed set of activities.,22,,
130,0.97,1584.182,1585.116,It will continue to evolve.,22,,
131,0.97,1585.116,1595.827,This is our current best thinking about how we bring vehicular traffic back to the bridge in the shortest possible Timeframe.,22,,
132,0.97,1595.827,1596.628,Thank you.,23,,
133,0.97,1596.628,1625.857,"So spring for having a better idea of whether or not repair or replacement is the path, and although it sounds to me like you are still saying that we need to deal with the lock bearing and shoring, it is the activities beyond that as it relates to repair that are in question.",23,,
134,0.97,1625.857,1649.28,"The reason I raise this is I and surprised that the number of constituents who have been contact me and saying do not spend the $33 million less rebuild, let's move towards rebuilding the bridge now, but what I hear you say is that we have to spend that $33 million either way.",23,,
135,0.97,1649.28,1664.496,"I think, so this is a very complicated set of issues and decisions that I do not think we want to rush into.",24,,
136,0.97,1664.496,1667.165,"I'm sorry, do we have to do the shoring construction or not?",25,,
137,0.97,1667.165,1675.206,"We have to make sure the bridge is stable and it is a public safety issue, so we will do everything that we need to do to make sure that the bridge is stable.",26,,
138,0.97,1675.206,1706.137,"If we decide, if we determine as we go through that process that it is not technically feasible or financially feasible to stabilize the bridge, or to repair the bridge, we can, if all of that thinking about where we go and what we do . I also want to be very clear we did not have the budget that we will talk about towards the end of the presentation.",26,,
139,0.97,1706.137,1714.112,It does not currently anticipate any demolition of the bridge.,26,,
140,0.97,1714.112,1723.221,"So if we were to go in a path we did not do a Playstation of the bridge, there are a lot of potential budgetary implications.",26,,
141,0.97,1723.221,1738.369,We are currently showing what our best path forward is right now to bring traffic back to the bridge as soon as possible.,26,,
142,0.97,1738.369,1749.047,"As we have more information, we will update that thinking and update the public and the council about what those decisions are.",26,,
143,0.97,1749.047,1752.484,Thank you.,27,,
144,0.97,1752.484,1760.158,I know we are starting to run a little bit low on time.,28,,
145,0.97,1760.158,1784.582,"I would like to, just I will try to go through as quickly as I can some of the technical information and I think it is important for people to understand a little bit about the condition of the bridge because I have heard some of the same concerns about why we are doing the work now to stabilize it.",28,,
146,0.97,1784.582,1787.018,I think some of what we can talk about helps explain that.,28,,
147,0.97,1787.018,1799.33,"Like I said, we, our first step is to slow or halt the bridge deterioration and there is more information here.",28,,
148,0.97,1799.33,1800.231,We still see cracks growing.,28,,
149,0.97,1800.231,1858.489,"I will move on to talking about one thing we think is affecting the condition of the bridge, which is on slide eight, and that is a Lateral bearing that is on the East side of the bridge, and the bridge has four sets of columns that carry three spans and this is at the Eastern side that we have a Lateral bearing that is a piece of the bridge that sits between the roadway and the support columns that hold up the bridge and it allows the bridge to move in response to thermal expansion, to traffic, to normal changes in concrete shrinkage over the course of time, and what we have seen is that one of the bearings, there is a picture here on this slide is compressed and is holding out and creating additional pressure that affects the whole of the bridge.",28,,
150,0.97,1858.489,1906.17,"So our first step here is to unlock that pressure on the bridge, and this column is Pier 18 and that is on the Eastern side, as I mentioned of the four sets of columns and peers, the pieces of the bridge on top of the columns, and this is on the East side . The two peers in the center 16 and 17 are the ones that hold the high span, the centerpiece of the high span and where we have seen cracking primarily on the high bridge is in the middle of that we are we have seen on this slide.",28,,
151,0.97,1906.17,1910.842,Some of the tension seems to be generated for the bearing on Pier 18.,28,,
152,0.97,1910.842,1918.249,Our first depth is to replace that bearing and we need to make sure the bridge is stable enough to do that.,28,,
153,0.97,1918.249,1929.16,"That involves jacking the bridge up slightly so the peer, the bearing can be replaced and that is some challenging work that needs to be done.",28,,
154,0.97,1929.16,1962.16,"Peers 18 and 15 are the two pieces that connect the high bridge to the rest of the structure, the structure that goes along Spokane on the East side, and the West Seattle freeway Expressway that goes up to the West side . So this is still, these are still important pieces of the bridge and they are where the load is transferred and form part of the unit that supports that area as well.",28,,
155,0.97,1962.16,1974.706,"Once that work is done, then we will begin the process of shoring the bridge to further stabilize it.",28,,
156,0.97,1974.706,1985.183,"I will reiterate, we are still at the early stages of this, working together to get more information.",28,,
157,0.97,1985.183,1989.754,That is why we have more instrumentation being installed to be able to answer these questions about whether and how we think about proceeding.,28,,
158,0.97,1989.754,1994.225,This is our current best understanding and best case scenario of how we work on the bridge.,28,,
159,0.97,1994.225,2023.855,"Shoring means adding temporary support that preserves the integrity of the bridge, and we think that by the middle of this year, we should be able to design how this would work, and procure the materials for how to make these stabilization repairs to the whole of the bridge and begin those repairs later this year.",28,,
160,0.97,2023.855,2030.161,"Once we have that shoring in place, we would begin the process of repair construction.",28,,
161,0.97,2030.161,2053.351,"I want to make sure that we are clear that there are a lot of elements of uncertainty, and this goes to Herbolt's questions about whether and how we think about stabilization, but we need to make sure it makes further repair feasible.",28,,
162,0.97,2053.351,2060.491,We don't know whether repair will require permits that impact on the navigation Channel.,28,,
163,0.97,2060.491,2101.232,"We need to design the process of how to do the construction and we don't know exactly what special application or equipment shoring and repair will require, whether there are, what the Leadtimes on those are, and we don't still know whether repair is feasible technically or financially, and again, we share everyone's frustration and concern about not knowing all the information that we need to know at this point and I sure everybody we are working as quickly as we can to be able to answer these questions.",28,,
164,0.97,2101.232,2103.034,We still don't know whether repair is possible.,28,,
165,0.97,2103.034,2112.41,"We are at very early stages, they are present of design and each step will impact what is feasible and how long it will take.",28,,
166,0.97,2112.41,2120.017,"We think that if repair is possible, it could add another 10 years of life to the bridge, but there is a lot that is still unknown.",28,,
167,0.97,2120.017,2141.372,We don't know whether that 10 years is sort of a guideline to details about how we think about Stabilization and repair will affect that additional life that we could provide for the bridge.,28,,
168,0.97,2141.372,2154.085,"Briefly, then I will turn it over to Heather to talk about what we are doing from a Non- bridge perspective to mitigate impacts on the surrounding community, as part of this, this is a very complicated bridge.",28,,
169,0.97,2154.085,2183.281,"We have a great team of experts as part of our design team, but we think there is additional expertise we can bring to bear from a technical perspective that can help make sure we are looking down every possible Avenue for how to think about stabilization repair, replacement of the bridge that can help us, help inform both our own in the public understanding of where we go with the bridge.",28,,
170,0.97,2183.281,2210.141,"So we are working to get a technical advisory panel formed that will be made up of experts from across the country, focus on bridge design, Geotechncal expertise, Maritime work, all aspects of what the structural aspects of the bridge will take that will help continue to inform our thinking going forward.",28,,
171,0.97,2210.141,2212.743,So I will turn it over to Heather to talk about where we,28,,
172,0.97,2212.743,2222.053,"Before you do that, we have another question about slide 13.",29,,
173,0.97,2222.053,2222.286,Thanks.,29,,
174,0.97,2222.286,2245.91,"As it relates to the technical advisory panel and the scope of their advisory authority, are they going to be making recommendations about whether or not it makes sense to proceed with shoring or with repair, just trying to figure out where their advice is going to be sought, at what stage, and",30,,
175,0.97,2245.91,2256.787,So we have not sent out invitations to the technical advisory panel as of now.,31,,
176,0.97,2256.787,2266.998,I think some of that scope of exactly where they will be providing input is to be determined.,31,,
177,0.97,2266.998,2279.043,I think our sentence is really additional expertise that can help us make sure we are looking down every possible Avenue.,31,,
178,0.97,2279.043,2324.255,"I do not anticipate they will have--I think they will be more of a sounding board that a recommending body, but I think we would rather have them give us ideas of creative solutions, make sure if we are thinking of every possible challenge or issue that we need to be thinking of early so we don't go down a Pathway that then we realize is not sustainable or feasible.",31,,
179,0.97,2324.255,2327.525,Good morning everyone.,32,,
180,0.97,2327.525,2329.46,Thank you.,32,,
181,0.97,2329.46,2336.834,I am Heather and I work at Sdot normally as the director of downtown mobility.,32,,
182,0.97,2336.834,2345.943,"I want to note that I live in West Seattle, so I am familiar with the difficulties this closure is causing.",32,,
183,0.97,2345.943,2352.683,Closing West Seattle high bridge has a similar level of complexity as closing the bile duct.,32,,
184,0.97,2352.683,2363.761,"Similar levels of traffic each and every day, but with a lot fewer Reroute choices and we have had a lot less time to plan.",32,,
185,0.97,2363.761,2377.708,"Right now, the low bridge is restricted to people who are driving emergency vehicles, freight and public transit as well as folks who are riding their bike or walking along the public path.",32,,
186,0.97,2377.708,2381.612,Seattle police Department is helping with our enforcement.,32,,
187,0.97,2381.612,2395.126,"Anybody needs to get to harbor Island can access that across the East channel bridge, so approaching harbor Island from the East.",32,,
188,0.97,2395.126,2401.232,I think we can move on please.,32,,
189,0.97,2401.232,2427.525,"As I think we have mentioned a few times, we have installed a signal at Highland parkway in Holden to help mitigate some of the issues of using Highland parkway as a Detour . We have also added Detour route Signage up to the first Avenue bridge and we can prove that, in fact we are improving all of those Detour Signage is continually as we receive input and see how things are working.",32,,
190,0.97,2427.525,2460.291,"The signals at the five way intersection down near terminal five have been connected to our citywide system so we can adjust signal timing as needed remotely . In addition, next weekend we will repay that intersection and add some additional amenities so that it operates a little bit better, just for the public's knowledge when we repay that intersection next weekend, it will limit access.",32,,
191,0.97,2460.291,2461.559,So people should plan around that.,32,,
192,0.97,2461.559,2474.205,"We have plans to fix potholes, smooth and sign the alternative routes so that those alternatives can operate as well as they can.",32,,
193,0.97,2474.205,2477.775,We are identifying more measures.,32,,
194,0.97,2477.775,2510.741,"It is important to note I think here that the current Detour and alternate routes cannot support the level of traffic that we had before the stay at home order, and so as we continue to communicate with the public, we are going to help them understand that we really do need to change some ways about how we get in and out to West Seattle.",32,,
195,0.97,2510.741,2520.751,"And to that end, we are working with our partners to keep buses moving in and out of Seattle as quickly as possible.",32,,
196,0.97,2520.751,2529.593,Can you go back to the previous slide . Herbolt wanted to ask a quick question.,33,,
197,0.97,2529.593,2533.33,Thank you.,34,,
198,0.97,2533.33,2536.333,This is both slide 14 and 15.,34,,
199,0.97,2536.333,2579.009,"As it relates to the lower level bridge, understanding that that bridge cannot support all of the traffic, even with these reduced traffic volumes that used to be held by the West Seattle bridge, the high numbers at the lower level bridge was carrying was around 16,000. the last set of numbers I have were from April 8 and ninth and that was right when SPD, the eighth is the day before SPD started enforcement and the ninth, they began an educational enforcement and that was 8000.",34,,
200,0.97,2579.009,2591.989,"I would like to note, that was nearly 2 weeks ago, I would like to know what the traffic counts are on the lower bridge now that there has been some",34,,
201,0.97,2591.989,2593.223,Thank you.,35,,
202,0.97,2593.223,2618.148,"We are seeing those same numbers, but Observationally, we also see that the police Department is out there enforcing generally during the peak times, they slide it around a little bit to keep it real, but when there is not enforcement, the violations of that request are substantial.",35,,
203,0.97,2618.148,2634.031,"And so we really need to impress upon people the importance of keeping that bridge opened and available particularly for emergency services, particularly during this public health crisis.",35,,
204,0.97,2634.031,2656.02,"So folks who are using the low bridge, please, I understand, believe me I understand how inconvenient this is, but please do consider using alternative routes at all times because we need to make sure that Ambulances can get in and out of the Peninsula.",35,,
205,0.97,2656.02,2660.09,"Don't just consider using alternative routes, don't use the lower level bridge.",36,,
206,0.97,2660.09,2663.494,You can get a ticket right now.,36,,
207,0.97,2663.494,2690.921,"I have committed to continuing to advocate for some relaxation of those restrictions for emergency workers and for off time commutes, like at night, but I only do so if you guys see drastically reduced volumes of traffic on the lower level bridge.",36,,
208,0.97,2690.921,2693.59,"If anybody is listening, stop using the lower level bridge.",36,,
209,0.97,2693.59,2703.934,You can be more direct.,37,,
210,0.97,2703.934,2705.569,You can be more direct than I can.,37,,
211,0.97,2705.569,2706.136,Stop it.,37,,
212,0.97,2706.136,2706.77,It is not helping.,37,,
213,0.97,2706.77,2708.405,Thank you for that line of questioning.,38,,
214,0.97,2708.405,2715.245,I think it is important to remind folks that it is not just a soft suggestion to avoid using the low bridge.,38,,
215,0.97,2715.245,2774.271,"It is an absolute need to avoid using the lower bridge and while we appreciate that creates convenience, I am a West Seattle resident, I think we have a very strong forum just on this call of West Seattleites, but I do think it is important for us, for the integrity of our citywide public safety system and for the public safety system as a whole of district 1 to make sure that folks stay off the low bridge until we are able to come up with some safer alternatives, perhaps some categories of exemptions for certain individuals, but I want to echo the forcefulness of Councilmember Herbolt's point around avoiding the use of the lower bridge until further notice.",38,,
216,0.97,2774.271,2782.446,"I know that Councilmember Mosqueda has a question or comment, so I will give the floor to her.",38,,
217,0.97,2782.446,2782.98,Thank you.,39,,
218,0.97,2782.98,2787.184,I want to again thank director Zimbabwe.,39,,
219,0.97,2787.184,2798.629,"I know we had a chance to chat briefly, but it does seem like there has been a dramatic reduction in the flow of traffic as folks may know.",39,,
220,0.97,2798.629,2813.644,"I live just around the corner, so this is part of my walking route to go on the lower bridge often, and just seeing it this morning, the police officers were down there redirecting traffic, and I could see emergency vehicles moving frequently, so that is appreciated.",39,,
221,0.97,2813.644,2817.047,A drastic difference from two Mondays ago.,39,,
222,0.97,2817.047,2846.977,"I want to ping you all again about where we are at considering whether or not Healthcare providers and human service providers like folks who work at des might be able to get a special okay to go on that lower bridge, perhaps that weaves into the comment about needing to see a reduction in individual trying to get on that bridge.",39,,
223,0.97,2846.977,2857.988,"I noticed the Signage now says I do not enter for bus and Commerce vehicles only, which I think is a direct sign and direct mandate to people to not get onto the bridge.",39,,
224,0.97,2857.988,2870.4,Can you remind us what the process is and the Timeframe for allowing Healthcare providers and homeless services or human service providers to have an acceptance to go on that bridge?,39,,
225,0.97,2870.4,2873.403,Thank you very much.,40,,
226,0.97,2873.403,2880.51,I do appreciate your support as we try to minimize traffic on the low bridge.,40,,
227,0.97,2880.51,2901.832,"We are working closely right now with the port of Seattle and businesses, essential businesses that operate down in the vicinity of the low bridge and trying to ascertain whether or not there time periods when we can relax our restrictions.",40,,
228,0.97,2901.832,2906.136,The difficulty is of course one of numbers.,40,,
229,0.97,2906.136,2951.081,"So as we relax restrictions, it becomes more and more difficult to explain why this kind of worker is more essential than that kind of worker . one of the things we have learned from this public health crisis is that we got a lot of essential people and so we are actively engaged in this conversation, and I think one of the difficulties for Healthcare workers and for human service workers is just figuring out the numbers . because we do have actual real imitations about how much traffic below bridge can handle.",40,,
230,0.97,2951.081,2973.77,"We can identify to the extent that we can identify workers and sort of do the arithmetic to figure out how many we can fit, that is one thing, but just trying to speculate about who in West Seattle is a doctor, nurse, or social worker is a difficult Calculus.",40,,
231,0.97,2973.77,2975.305,That makes sense.,41,,
232,0.97,2975.305,2976.44,One quick follow-up.,41,,
233,0.97,2976.44,2990.987,"I just want to make note of the time, 10:20 2 am, and we have a rather robust conversation in terms of committee reports this afternoon.",42,,
234,0.97,2990.987,3001.331,So I will encourage us to move along after the question so that we can avoid being here until one.,42,,
235,0.97,3001.331,3003.5,Go ahead.,42,,
236,0.97,3003.5,3004.468,Thank you.,43,,
237,0.97,3004.468,3011.308,Thanks for that report back.,43,,
238,0.97,3011.308,3014.745,Appreciate the updates as you consider what the numbers may or may not be.,43,,
239,0.97,3014.745,3028.892,"A quick PSA, I want to remind folks, please tell me if you heard otherwise, there is no document that essential workers need to have on them at this point.",43,,
240,0.97,3028.892,3056.453,"We have heard reports, and I will be following up with Councilmember Herbolt and the committee as well that we have heard reports of police officers pulling people over and asking for their essential workers permit and we want to make sure that is not something people are being asked for, and I don't think it relates to the lower bridge as people have been pulled over for incorrectly Accessing the bridge.",43,,
241,0.97,3056.453,3072.068,"As a consider whether or not we have others access that bridge, we would love to work with you all about what kind of documentation that may or may not be because I do not want that to be an excuse for folks to get pulled over.",43,,
242,0.97,3072.068,3074.704,"We will be following up with more information, but that was a quick PSA.",43,,
243,0.97,3074.704,3076.106,"There is not a document needed,",43,,
244,0.97,3076.106,3119.816,"This is a good question, and yes . There is a very small number, very small number of Ilwu workers who are dispatched from their Union hall on East marginal way and because of the speed with which they have to arrive at terminal five, they are allowed right now, I know this is problematic, so we are going to move through that for a second, they have more of a Placard that just says that they are and Ilwu worker that has been dispatched and going to terminal five.",44,,
245,0.97,3119.816,3140.137,"Sdot shares your concern both direct and indirect about requiring people to have any kind of pass, and not just for human rights reasons, but also because there is no place to pull people over and check.",44,,
246,0.97,3140.137,3145.976,"So right now, it is a tiny number of workers who are using that.",44,,
247,0.97,3145.976,3153.85,"It is not a path, it is a Placard that should indicate to policeman at a glance that they are authorized to use the bridge.",44,,
248,0.97,3153.85,3157.988,Does that clarify?,44,,
249,0.97,3157.988,3158.555,"Yes, thank you.",45,,
250,0.97,3158.555,3159.99,You are welcome.,46,,
251,0.97,3159.99,3172.602,"Let me say we are working with King County Metro very thoroughly, so just in the interest of time, I will hand it back to Sam and he can talk about our order of magnitude",46,,
252,0.97,3172.602,3220.35,"I will just Iterate we are working with all sorts of transit partners on developing contingency plans and transit has been one of the places that the public health crisis has also hit the hardest in terms of making day-to-day decisions based on the health of their workforce and made it challenging to think about it, even how we move into recovery and how we move forward from transit route the region knowing it is still essential to our success as a city and as a region, but some of those plans will continue to emerge as we work with our partners in a time when they are trying to manage the day-to-day as well.",47,,
253,0.97,3220.35,3261.491,"We did want to spend a brief time on what our order of magnitude budget is assuring, especially hearing the questions that we have gotten about is this money worth it, and I want to say that this dollar figure that we are showing here is still very early in our understanding of exactly what needs to be done through Stabilization and repair and potential replacement as well, and some of these costs are the costs related to Shorting construction as we know it now, on the order of $50 million.",47,,
254,0.97,3261.491,3274.004,So most of the other cost here we are showing in terms of order of magnitude need to be done regardless of what our path forward is.,47,,
255,0.97,3274.004,3316.646,"We think Shorting is necessary on the repair Pathway, but both the installation of monitoring equipment, the design of our approach going forward structurally, the construction work related to peer 18, but also some of what we have talked about in terms of traffic control mitigation, communications efforts and then something I think we want to highlight is our need to continue to take care and accelerate the maintenance of the swing bridge to make sure it remains a viable and robust transportation asset as well.",47,,

326,0.97,4047.176,4055.785,It would be best for us to reserve comment until that happens just to facilitate the ease of the conversation.,53,,
327,0.97,4055.785,4081.277,"I apologize for not saying that at the top of my transition to this section of the agenda, but I think for ease of helping us and the public track what we are talking about, it would be ideal to wait until Councilmember Strauss has addressed the bill before we launch the conversation around amendments.",53,,
328,0.97,4081.277,4094.523,"So if those comments are currently in your script or in your notes, I would ask you to hold on those and on those until we have had an opportunity to hear from the primary sponsor of that bill.",53,,

352,0.97,4365.661,4376.705,"This reflects that big business will use predictably all their political power, their clout to prevent having to pay their fair share of taxes.",56,,
353,0.97,4376.705,4386.482,"They talk about shared sacrifice, but we know that this is not a shared sacrifice, that crisis is not landing on everyone's shoulders equally.",56,,
354,0.97,4386.482,4422.317,"It is working people bearing the brunt of this crisis right now, many small businesses especially owned by immigrants, and people of color community members have been wiped out while corporate executives are getting not only, they are not only able to weather the storm because of tax cuts, but on top of that, they are getting bailouts from the Trump administration, which far outweighs the stimulus checks going to workers . It is gravely inadequate.",56,,
355,0.97,4422.317,4433.028,We have also seen the Chamber of Commerce falsely claiming this is a tax on jobs.,56,,
356,0.97,4433.028,4434.63,This is not a tax on jobs.,56,,
357,0.97,4434.63,4445.374,"It is a tax on big businesses, not on the workers, and the workers and many of the industries that will be taxed are supporting this tax.",56,,

361,0.97,4472.0,4507.002,"I have also stated my preference, or public comment because it is hard for people, working people, many people who are at home are working, and other essential workers are still actually at work, physically at work, we need to make sure public comment, the timing is predictable, part of the problem with keeping it at the end is people don't know when to comments.",56,,
362,0.97,4507.002,4516.912,I think that councils discussion in the committee should be informed by public comment.,56,,

367,0.97,4556.685,4562.591,We went make sure we understand this is something that is a product of democratic discussion and debate.,56,,
368,0.97,4562.591,4579.875,"I wanted to quickly also share what I have already shared with the chair, this is something that we develop, which is recommendations for Texting Amazon.",56,,
369,0.97,4579.875,4592.688,I am hoping that we will hear from these members and leaders who have been involved in the discussions around this legislation.,56,,
370,0.97,4592.688,4610.939,"One of them is David parson, the President of UAW, which is the Union that represents 6000 employees at the University of Washington, that unit has been active in taxation.",56,,
371,0.97,4610.939,4612.941,It will also be good to have somebody here locally.,56,,

373,0.97,4617.713,4624.353,"Somebody like Violet, who is the director of Washington.",56,,
374,0.97,4624.353,4653.382,"Or someone from card green, and also we need, as people explain to us why we need the new Union jobs that will be created as a result of this tax because the jobs are always welcome, but especially as we go into a deep recession where we are going to have joblessness and while this legislation will not create enough jobs, it will make a dent in the joblessness we will be facing.",56,,
375,0.97,4653.382,4660.088,I would also include Katie and Kristin from the 2018 progressive revenue task force.,56,,

390,0.97,4817.112,4837.032,"We will go ahead and have you give your report on things unrelated to the counsel bill, then you will transition into the counsel bill and we will hear from Laois and then we will open it up for questions and answers.",59,,
391,0.97,4837.032,4838.767,That is how I have heard the proposal.,59,,
392,0.97,4838.767,4845.006,Why don't we go ahead and start with your report and we will go from there.,59,,
393,0.97,4845.006,4845.373,Thank you.,60,,
394,0.97,4845.373,4858.153,Last week I joined the Lukens brings community Council virtual meeting and held district hours over the phone.,60,,

396,0.97,4861.89,4865.66,"Regarding comments on the hepatitis a spikes, initial steps have been taken.",60,,
397,0.97,4865.66,4868.597,My call for urgency remains and I will issue updates as I receive them.,60,,
398,0.97,4868.597,4878.907,I want to take a moment to speak in honor of Senator John McCoy who this past week announced he will be retiring from the Washington state Legislature.,60,,
399,0.97,4878.907,4889.818,He served for 17 years and most recently is the chair of the Senate Democratic caucus.,60,,
400,0.97,4889.818,4899.861,"He served for 20 years in the U.S. airports, served as a White House computer technician in the 1990s and the general manager for the tribe that has been the second largest economic engine in Snohomish County.",60,,
401,0.97,4899.861,4907.936,"I wanted to take this moment because I am grateful to learn from Senator McCoy, and I want to honor his leadership.",60,,
402,0.97,4907.936,4910.939,Thank you Senator McCoy for all you have done for our state.,60,,
403,0.97,4910.939,4929.157,"This week, my office continues to Prioritize small businesses and people navigating resources, and then Finally, speaking about Committee, there are three items on the land use Committee on today's agenda.",60,,
404,0.97,4929.157,4961.556,"While counsel bill 119776 our final approvals for the urban village, the plot device one parcel into 21 parcels to facilitate the sale of individual Townhomes, which have already been construct did .

405,0.97,4961.556,4964.793,So that will be before us.,60,,
406,0.97,4964.793,4978.573,We have confirmed this meets all conditions and recommended approvals.,60,,
407,0.97,4978.573,4999.06,"Getting caught up because we do have a large bill today, counsel bill 119 769 is the emergency legislation, which we have discussed for several weeks now relating to design review, which is intended to allow projects to continue moving forward during the Covid emergency.",60,,

410,0.97,5019.848,5024.853,There has been a lot over the weekend to see this bill through.,60,,
411,0.97,5024.853,5030.625,I would like to turn it either back to the President or central staff.,60,,
412,0.97,5030.625,5032.56,Thank you.,61,,
413,0.97,5032.56,5038.767,Let's go ahead . who wants to go first?,61,,
414,0.97,5038.767,5042.771,I will go ahead and start.,62,,
415,0.97,5042.771,5071.399,"As the Councilmember mentioned earlier, this would allow the Department of neighborhoods in the Seattle Department of construction to process administratively some types of reviews that otherwise would require in person meetings and the purpose is to avoid in person meetings, which can't occur due to the emergency.",62,,
416,0.97,5071.399,5081.509,"The bill would be an active an emergency basis on the terms of the bill, the shift to administrative review would last for 180 days.",62,,
417,0.97,5081.509,5090.151,"There are some nuance that I discussed previously, if you have questions, we can go into it.",62,,
418,0.97,5090.151,5095.023,What might be useful is if we walk through the amendments we know of that may be proposed today.,62,,
419,0.97,5095.023,5101.129,I think that would be best.,63,,
420,0.97,5101.129,5108.036,"Fob get into the amendments, let me ask my colleagues.",63,,
421,0.97,5108.036,5121.816,"Again, setting aside the amendments, are there any questions about the underlying bill and what it would accomplish that you have for either Quito or the wish or Councilmember Strauss?",63,,
422,0.97,5121.816,5127.455,"I am not seeing--Okay, Councilmember Lewis.",63,,
423,0.97,5127.455,5138.566,"It looks like you have a question about just the underlying bill, setting aside amendments, so I will go ahead and yield the floor to you for questions.",63,,
424,0.97,5138.566,5144.973,"I have a quick question, just to clarify something.",64,,
425,0.97,5144.973,5148.977,"I want to make sure because there has been misconceptions, I think part of this bill in the public.",64,,
426,0.97,5148.977,5153.481,"My understanding is that there was a big decision, putting in a new building.",64,,
427,0.97,5153.481,5158.386,Like new construction.,64,,
428,0.97,5158.386,5188.983,"That that would be subject, like that could go forward without having the board review, and that could be approved administratively for the next 60 days, but then hopefully at some point over that Timeframe, the ability to have those meetings remotely would be created, and at that point, the board review would come back and come back and sort of a virtual format.",64,,
429,0.97,5188.983,5212.941,"That we are not, just so I can clarify, we are not under this for the next 60 days freezing the approvals of big decisions like construction of a new building, but allow administrator review only for some of the smaller preservation decisions and smaller approvals.",64,,
430,0.97,5212.941,5216.544,Yeah . I will elaborate.,65,,
431,0.97,5216.544,5222.15,"There are two, you are asking about two things.",65,,
432,0.97,5222.15,5225.553,The bill treats different reviews differently.,65,,
433,0.97,5225.553,5236.731,"For design review, which would be construction of a new building and may not require any sign of approvals from any kind of landmarks review or preservation body.",65,,
434,0.97,5236.731,5243.171,"Projects would shift to administrative design review, which is a process that some can bail themselves out.",65,,
435,0.97,5243.171,5246.774,There are no in person meetings.,65,,
436,0.97,5246.774,5272.7,"For a period of time, that period of time is either the earlier of 180 days, which is the term of the bill . a time at which FTC I said up virtual meetings, which comply with the governor's order, or a time in which boards begin meeting again in person subject to whatever requirements King County public health has to protect public health safety and welfare.",65,,
437,0.97,5272.7,5274.202,That is the design review side of things.,65,,
438,0.97,5274.202,5284.712,"On the historic reservation side of things and programs administered by DOM, meetings and boards are suspended for 60 days under the bill.",65,,
439,0.97,5284.712,5304.399,"For the full 180 day length of the bill, the historic reservation officer for the director depending would have some authority to make specified decisions that at least in the estimation of the Mayor are relatively modest in scope.",65,,
440,0.97,5304.399,5314.142,We have listed them to the memorandum from a week or so ago.,65,,
441,0.97,5314.142,5314.609,Thank you.,66,,
442,0.97,5314.609,5316.577,That was the only question I had.,66,,
443,0.97,5316.577,5319.113,Okay.,67,,
444,0.97,5319.113,5321.582,If I may address the underlying bill before we moved to amendments.,67,,
445,0.97,5321.582,5327.922,"Councilmember Strauss, please feel free to address the underlying bill.",68,,
446,0.97,5327.922,5329.957,Thank you so much.,69,,
447,0.97,5329.957,5351.979,"Like all of you, I have asked many many questions over the last month or so, some of the questions that you have asked, I have asked and amendments you have drafted, I was initially going to draft and the found the reasons why it might not be the best Pathway forward.",69,,
448,0.97,5351.979,5372.667,So I went to call back attention to the memo that we received last week because I asked all the departments to very clearly explained to me so that we could clearly explained to everyone here at counsel and to the public why these meetings are different than other types of meetings.,69,,
449,0.97,5372.667,5387.715,"What the barriers to creating virtual meetings are, what is the Timeline for bringing these virtual meetings Online and what is the public engagement strategy to allow people to know how they may participate.",69,,
450,0.97,5387.715,5407.001,So the time sensitivity regarding this is that more than 20 proposed residential projects representing 3500 housing units in an assisted living facility are currently on hold because their design review meetings have been canceled.,69,,
451,0.97,5407.001,5413.841,"Another 20 projects are expected to be delayed each month, creating additional backlog for the design review boards that could Outlast our current emergency.",69,,
452,0.97,5413.841,5423.451,"It typically takes about one year to move through the design review process, and so allowing these projects to continue moving is very important.",69,,
453,0.97,5423.451,5437.832,Master use permits are only able to be created after the design review process and there is additional staff work required between master use permits and building permits being issued.,69,,
454,0.97,5437.832,5455.082,"So I call attention that if we stall the design review process, then we are back logging all of our staff to work on both master use permits and then the work that must occur between master use permits to building permits.",69,,
455,0.97,5455.082,5463.691,"If we are not able to create this Pathway, we limit our staff's ability to continue working during this emergency.",69,,
456,0.97,5463.691,5471.732,I do want to highlight that jobs are created and housing dollars are received by the city only at the issuance of building permits.,69,,
457,0.97,5471.732,5496.19,"So this would be the third step, design review board master use permits and then building permits and so if we are stopping our input of projects, we are delaying our ability to have jobs ready and projects shovel ready and we are also delaying our ability to receive housing dollars.",69,,
458,0.97,5496.19,5505.7,"Additionally, another 30 projects including four affordable housing products are currently unable to proceed because they cannot complete their early community outreach.",69,,
459,0.97,5505.7,5511.005,This legislation clarifies and requires early community outreach.,69,,
460,0.97,5511.005,5529.924,"There is also a minor Denmark recommendation that the key arena product or the Coliseum project needs, it has already been Delaed for several weeks and would become a pinch point this next May.",69,,
461,0.97,5529.924,5534.161,So I highlight this as there is a serious time sensitivity to passing legislation today on an emergency basis.,69,,
462,0.97,5534.161,5542.27,Now I also ask why our design review board meetings challenging to have virtually.,69,,
463,0.97,5542.27,5565.192,"We hear our counsel have been able to have virtual meetings, for instance the design Commission has also been able to have virtual meetings, and while departments have been taking steps to hold design review meetings virtually, there are several barriers we still need to address.",69,,
464,0.97,5565.192,5570.765,"This includes the size of design review programs, which involves 20-30 meetings each month and over 100 staff members who would need to be trained.",69,,
465,0.97,5570.765,5593.321,"There are more than 70 volunteer board members with varying abilities and technological access, so the difference between a design review board and our city councils design review boards are volunteer, whereas this is our job here at counsel.",69,,
466,0.97,5593.321,5608.803,"They are facilitating with public comment meetings that involve COMP plaques technical documents and rich presentation, especially public comment.",69,,
467,0.97,5608.803,5612.54,That is beyond even what we experience here at the city council with public comment.,69,,
468,0.97,5612.54,5621.649,"There is actually, there is a Facilitation conversation about these very complex technical documents.",69,,
469,0.97,5621.649,5634.929,"It is more than just a directional here is what I am thinking, it is here is what I am thinking and the board has to continue these conversations.",69,,
470,0.97,5634.929,5647.942,"We are also able to be together on this call today because this is our primary job, whereas I these review board members are volunteer.",69,,
471,0.97,5647.942,5658.653,"The design Commission has been able to hold a virtual meeting, which is promising, and I think a good study, but design review boards are much more complex and interactive.",69,,
472,0.97,5658.653,5667.662,"That is really the key part of this is that this is an interactive process, whereas the design Commission is 11 numbers.",69,,
473,0.97,5667.662,5677.271,One of my amendments today would require reporting in 60 days on the executive progress towards starting these virtual meetings.,69,,
474,0.97,5677.271,5699.326,"Public engagement also, we are requiring a plan to be presented by May 15 for at the time that virtual meetings are able to start, and or how is the public being engaged to know and interact with the public comment options that are available.",69,,
475,0.97,5699.326,5708.402,"When you compare administered of design review to the full design review, there is only one fewer opportunities for public comment.",69,,
476,0.97,5708.402,5723.717,"It is paramount to my understanding that if the public does not know they have an opportunity, that opportunity in essence does not make sense, so that is why we are calling to require this plan to be presented to us.",69,,
477,0.97,5723.717,5732.426,The legislation is written to virtually mirror public engagement opportunities . They are using a typical process.,69,,
478,0.97,5732.426,5739.166,The memo that we received Additionally commits to providing us this plan.,69,,
479,0.97,5739.166,5760.921,"Regarding affordable housing specifically lessons affordable housing projects are already allowed to move through administrative design review, because the city has--we are focused and committed to getting affordable housing through our permitting processes because we do not want to be the delay for affordable housing projects coming Online.",69,,
480,0.97,5760.921,5810.437,"This legislation allows them to bypass us temporarily for six months because during this public emergency, this is an opportunity to deliver the affordable housing, because as as TCI Prioritizes other products at other levels, there becomes increased amount of staff work for our planners, meaning each work that typically would have a design review is having, there is a larger body of work for them to a compass, which means if we want to continue Prioritizing affordable housing, we need to move that up.",69,,
481,0.97,5810.437,5816.343,"Affordable housing is also one of the only types of construction that is currently permitted under the governor's orders, which makes it Additionally important.",69,,
482,0.97,5816.343,5827.054,"Those are my comments on the base of the bill, and I welcome central steps presentation on our amendments.",69,,
483,0.97,5827.054,5831.759,Great.,70,,
484,0.97,5831.759,5843.204,Any other questions on the underlying base bill before we have central staff walk us through the substitute bills of which there are a couple different versions.,70,,
485,0.97,5843.204,5849.476,"I guess I would call it 2.5 version, and then we have several amendments to go through.",70,,
486,0.97,5849.476,5850.244,Council member Louis.,70,,
487,0.97,5850.244,5869.697,"I have a couple of questions, and I appreciate the presentation just now around the virtual meeting enumerated by DCI and they are very comprehensive to us.",71,,
488,0.97,5869.697,5884.812,"I wanted to ask you if you have any additional clarifying information on a few of their points, where I don't think I have all the information yet necessarily.",71,,
489,0.97,5884.812,5910.037,"So it says they are going to have to train over 100 staff members, and I guess my first question would be, like do you generally know the profile of those staff members and to do you know exactly what they need to be trained to do two do the city staff include volunteer board and commissioners, just clarifying that would be good to know.",71,,
490,0.97,5910.037,5917.845,I believe that my notes may have incorrectly identified them as staff.,72,,
491,0.97,5917.845,5926.153,"I believe they are volunteers, as there are about 100 volunteers on design review boards because we have a design review boards.",72,,
492,0.97,5926.153,5930.658,"So it is more, this is more complex than just one design review board.",72,,
493,0.97,5930.658,5934.962,There are different design review boards for different sections of the city.,72,,
494,0.97,5934.962,5938.966,"Central staff, correct me if I am incorrect.",72,,
495,0.97,5938.966,5947.775,I am trying to recall the content of that memo.,73,,
496,0.97,5947.775,5948.976,100 seems large.,73,,
497,0.97,5948.976,5966.193,"I suspect that number is landmark boards as well . There are multiple design review boards, but I am guessing that that number is probably design review and other answer preservation review boards.",73,,
498,0.97,5966.193,5979.406,I guess that is my assumption as well . But I guess that my question is more like what the extent of the training Department receipts to be required as.,74,,
499,0.97,5979.406,5984.912,Are some people just being trained to participate the way we participate as Councilmembers and a meeting?,74,,
500,0.97,5984.912,5997.424,"Úthat seems pretty simple, or I there background staff work that is going to be more require a bigger contribution of resources and what is that number?",74,,
501,0.97,5997.424,6013.207,"I think it is one thing to say is it is over 100 staff, which is what we have been told in the memo, what percentage of them are the board members that will be participating in the meetings that have to learn how to use the zoom.",74,,
502,0.97,6013.207,6020.547,"What is the percentage that are staff and have to set up the meetings, which I agree we are getting increasingly good at as a city counsel.",74,,
503,0.97,6020.547,6054.148,"I had a Townhall meeting last week with a large number of participants where there was considerable amount of interaction, and pictures were shared, that seems to be the hurdles that they are saying they have that make it difficult to run these particular meetings and a virtual manner, so I guess my question is adjusted the extent of the training and what kind of barrier that is, that is not clearly enumerated in the memo, and how that differs based on the personnel.",74,,
504,0.97,6054.148,6055.716,The second question.,74,,
505,0.97,6055.716,6082.509,"Can I answer that question so we don't get lost two there are 100 volunteers who, whereas this is our formal and primary job, these are folks that are already working another job that may have additional Healthcare or Childcare or other competing priorities . So from my understanding, yes, it is a zoom type training.",75,,
506,0.97,6082.509,6088.982,"There is the additional complexity that there is a conversation, so it is not a one directional presentation.",75,,
507,0.97,6088.982,6092.753,There are complex technical documents of plans.,75,,
508,0.97,6092.753,6123.05,"Plans usually come rolled up and then have to be rolled out over the entire table, so usually there is quite a lot of interaction on very Nuanced information, and the last point that I would make is that it has taken us quite some time just to get to the point where we are today, even with public comment, and so that is why there are as X of the bill that would nullify the bill if and when virtual meetings are able to be taken place.",75,,
509,0.97,6123.05,6129.289,That barriers to virtual meetings are not areas to virtual meetings for six months.,75,,
510,0.97,6129.289,6152.246,"They are barriers for the here and now because at this date and time are we are unable to create a virtual meeting that is able to Digest the complexity of the nature of these meetings, so it is my hope as it sounds like with you as well that we get these virtual meetings up and running as soon as possible.",75,,
511,0.97,6152.246,6153.18,Thanks for letting me answer,75,,
512,0.97,6153.18,6162.923,"The second question was more, this one I find more compelling.",76,,
513,0.97,6162.923,6166.093,I am frankly not there yet on how insurmountable it is to have these virtual meetings.,76,,
514,0.97,6166.093,6170.397,"My next question, I see why there might be like a due process reason.",76,,
515,0.97,6170.397,6175.102,This would be able to happen.,76,,
516,0.97,6175.102,6217.744,"Whether there is a way, this is I guess related to the virtual meetings . The extensive Agendas of the design review boards and the number of projects that they promised, I understand how that can be difficult to do and a virtual meeting with a long agenda, so I wonder to what extent the Department and those boards can triage projects based on the category or nature projects, or other things to Úlower the amount of projects that are considered on a temporary basis if there was a transition of virtual meetings, if that is another factor that could potentially reduce it.",76,,
517,0.97,6217.744,6219.613,Or what problems or something like that I present.,76,,
518,0.97,6219.613,6221.448,That was the second question for clarification before we,76,,
519,0.97,6221.448,6224.918,Could you focus the question there really?,77,,
520,0.97,6224.918,6243.437,"Right, so there is a large number of actions that are on the agenda for a lot of these meetings, like typically over in the memo, they say typically over 30 potential actions that they are requesting action from a design review work on.",78,,
521,0.97,6243.437,6266.36,"If there is a way that number of actions could be reduced, so Maybe they consider between 10 and 20 instead of over 30, that might be another limiting way to get us through the Covid crisis, keep the pipeline open for project, but maybe not as many as we were doing Pre- Tran12.",78,,
522,0.97,6266.36,6268.695,This is all assuming we transition to virtual meetings.,78,,
523,0.97,6268.695,6276.403,I am saying that one of the hurdles fund has been presented is the volume of proposals.,78,,
524,0.97,6276.403,6281.174,So I wanted to throw that out there.,78,,
525,0.97,6281.174,6282.109,Thanks for that.,79,,
526,0.97,6282.109,6300.427,"I would say it is a volume and complexity issue . So building permits, master use permit, design review process is taking into consideration all this very Nuanced information and requiring feedback.",79,,
527,0.97,6300.427,6309.636,"So I guess I would take our experience here at the Council over the last two weeks, and I believe I have been calling some of our colleagues.",79,,
528,0.97,6309.636,6319.78,"I started calling about three weeks ago to have conversations about very Nuanced information, that really we here on city counsel, we are generalists.",79,,
529,0.97,6319.78,6365.192,"The subject matter experts in these departments are the correct individuals to know when and how much and how projects should shift because they know more about Land-Use than any of us sitting on the Council, and that is why it is important to until virtual meetings are able to be stood up, which I believe should be able to happen in short order, which is why we have that 60 day threshold for reporting, because if they are not able to stand them up within 60 days, I think that is when additional questions are coming.",79,,
530,0.97,6365.192,6370.764,"And so I bring back, I don't disagree with your point about maybe being able to reduce those numbers of agenda items.",79,,
531,0.97,6370.764,6392.419,"I share with you that standing up a virtual meeting where you are having feedback about complex documents is even more complex than the conversations that we have been trying to have around the subject matter of this bill, which is complex, and yet less complex than the design review.",79,,
532,0.97,6392.419,6416.843,"I will move us along because it is 11:20. I think if you have additional questions about the representations made by the Department, it would be appropriate for you to reach out directly to the Department to get follow-up on those questions before 2 o'clock today, which is when we will be considering legislative action on this particular counsel bill.",80,,
533,0.97,6416.843,6435.028,"I will note that all of the possibilities that you have proposed in your line of questioning, Councilmember Lewis are not possible unless we take some kind of action to divide temporary permitting process changes in this context.",80,,
534,0.97,6435.028,6469.596,"So it will be all for naught in terms of those potential opportunities if we don't address the realities of the Governors order and proclamation to not convene in public, and the realities of the ticking clock that we have before us as it relates to some of these permits and specific projects during this period of the emergency.",80,,
535,0.97,6469.596,6490.884,I think that is why this legislation is time sensitive and why we are considering it today and why it is important for us to make sure we have a clear sense of what these amendments will do in the context of dividing some temporary permitting process changes to make sure we don't inadvertently clog up the system.,80,,
536,0.97,6490.884,6520.814,"So let's go ahead and hear from Keeble and Lish on the various amendments that will come before counsel at 2 o'clock and I will go ahead and do some light lobbying now, to the extent that you all can work with a primary sponsor on collapsing some of these amendments into the underlying bill, the smoother I think this afternoon will go.",80,,
537,0.97,6520.814,6536.529,I just want to encourage you to work with a prime sponsor on resolving any outstanding issues before 2 o'clock so that we can make this afternoon go as smoothly as possible.,80,,
538,0.97,6536.529,6551.144,"I know that is a wish I am putting out there and if it is not feasible, I understand why it might not be, but my hope is that through the conversation today, we can coalesce around some potential solutions and have a smooth meeting this afternoon at 2 o'clock.",80,,
539,0.97,6551.144,6560.42,So please walk us through the amendments as proposed by individual Councilmembers.,80,,
540,0.97,6624.784,6648.875,"It will remove an authority granted to STC I and the Department to approve changes to Seattle public schools, and it would remove provisions in the bill that would cancel meetings of the landmarks board the special review boards and other historic boards and commissions.",81,,
541,0.97,6648.875,6685.979,"It does retain a provision that allows Timelines for Department neighborhoods to be told, and it States that those Timelines and deadlines related to historic landmark review are put on hold for the earlier of 60 days, or when the youth can be restarted, including providing language access to people who do not have English as a spoken language.",81,,
542,0.97,6685.979,6689.616,Any questions?,81,,
543,0.97,6689.616,6713.807,"So I see a lot of things that have been removed, so there is the chart, there is a chart that describes all the different changes including citations to the page of the opposed amendment substitute.",82,,
544,0.97,6713.807,6740.066,"I see a lot of things that have been removed, so I want to sort of hear from you a description of what this substitute amendment does in the positive as opposed to the negative so we have a clear sense of although there are the substitute proposes removal of many of these things, what does that leave?",82,,
545,0.97,6740.066,6758.151,"So it leaves all of the provisions related to the design review program, so the bill would continue to shift design review projects, which are managed by the Seattle Department of construction inspections to an administrative process where meetings do not occur.",83,,
546,0.97,6758.151,6770.163,"For landmark projects and products in historic and special review districts, once meetings are able to occur, they will occur.",83,,
547,0.97,6770.163,6803.429,"The Agendas will probably be very heavy . The underlying bill does propose to triage the types of reviews that those boards use, so the boards would be back to reviewing both large changes in construction, major modifications to buildings as well as minor changes to structures within historic districts and landmarks.",83,,
548,0.97,6803.429,6822.148,So really the distinction here is that it truly is sort of just a complete cutting out of any review work that would be conducted by the Department of neighborhoods that would fall into the landmark preservation category or the historic preservation context.,84,,
549,0.97,6822.148,6829.789,"Also, a provision related to the Seattle school district that allows for administrative review of schools.",85,,
550,0.97,6829.789,6867.36,"If this substitute were to be adopted and we created that Bifurcated system of having things related to STC I going forward because it is through design review Commission, but having nothing considered in the context of landmarks and historic preservation in Seattle school district context, what is the impact, what is the practical impact of that Bifurcation particularly to those projects that are going to be exempted from this bill?",86,,
551,0.97,6867.36,6912.505,"So basically, all of the landmark and historic district boards would start having their meetings . They would have a heavy workload because the last two months, they have not been meeting, and their meetings would, the intent of the Department would be to be able to provide translation and Digital access to meetings, but I am not sure that that will be the case for all members of the community.",87,,
552,0.97,6912.505,6926.853,"If the governor's proclamation is still in place and prohibits the gathering of people, then how is the Workplan you just described going to occur if those processes are exempted from the",88,,
553,0.97,6926.853,6959.719,"So well they probably will not meet until the Oh PMA Governors order has been met, or they can provide an alternative . a lot of their work is normal and routine and necessary to allow people to maintain their structures, and so they can continue to meet on those sorts of issues under the order.",89,,
554,0.97,6959.719,6963.456,Okay.,90,,
555,0.97,6963.456,6969.996,Would more or less like to speak to this.,91,,
556,0.97,6969.996,6976.97,"I do have comments on this substitute, but would like to yield to the court before I say anything.",91,,
557,0.97,6976.97,6979.906,You just took the words out of my mouth.,92,,
558,0.97,6979.906,6982.175,I was headed in that direction.,92,,
559,0.97,6982.175,6992.852,"So I was going to hand it over to Councilmember or Alice to address her proposed substitute, and then we will open it back up to questions.",92,,
560,0.97,6992.852,7001.227,Ur on mute . So you will need to Unmute.,93,,
561,0.97,7001.227,7004.464,Is that better?,94,,
562,0.97,7004.464,7008.101,We can hear you.,95,,
563,0.97,7008.101,7010.136,To technology.,96,,
564,0.97,7010.136,7045.671,"Thank you for working with us on this amendment, and I want to thank Councilmember Strauss for the work he has done to address these issues . I have to say I do think it would have been better for the Mayor to submit two separate bills to address what this bill is trying to do . The bill Conflates and confuses the need for affordable housing work with community engagement and neighborhood development.",96,,
565,0.97,7045.671,7069.962,"So that is what we are trying to address with the substitute, to highlight that we do have a real need to Prioritize affordable housing, and we need to Makesure that we continue to have equitable immunity input, especially in communities whose primary language is not English.",96,,
566,0.97,7069.962,7074.567,We should not be sacrificing that during this civil emergency.,96,,
567,0.97,7074.567,7076.669,So that is what we are trying to do here.,96,,
568,0.97,7076.669,7117.109,"We are removing the emergency shift decision-making from the special review districts, from the public school development committee landmark, then landmark report and you know, suspending the DOM approvals to the earlier of 60 days or that dates that boards of commissions can meet virtually with language access, or until the emergency is over and we can begin meeting in person again.",96,,
569,0.97,7117.109,7147.073,"So the intent here is not to impact the design review process, so that work can continue, as Councilmember Strauss mentioned . that is important for that to continue so we can complete affordable housing projects, but the real intent is to separate that work from the other work that really allows community to have an input and how their neighborhoods function.",96,,
570,0.97,7147.073,7149.742,Okay.,97,,
571,0.97,7149.742,7164.59,Any questions or Councilmember morale is or any additional information from central staff on that?,97,,
572,0.97,7164.59,7166.125,"Councilmember Strauss, the floor is yours.",97,,
573,0.97,7166.125,7168.394,Thank you.,98,,
574,0.97,7168.394,7191.184,"I appreciate the intent in amendment forward . Ing this I do believe at this time it is too broad-based to receive my support because there are some special review districts that have inconsequential products, whereas I understand there are some districts that have contested projects.",98,,
575,0.97,7191.184,7206.499,"So I welcome any amendment to pull any special review districts out of this will or any particular projects, which you do not believe should go through an administrative design review.",98,,
576,0.97,7206.499,7252.578,"I will come as exemptions because the priority with this bill is not to remove public input from contested or consequential decisions . The purpose and intent of this bill is to move the city forward and being able to accomplish staff work and pass routine decisions . for instance, if there is a shop owner in the special review district that needs to make an adjustment to their exterior sign or their lighting or their door, I don't believe that that should be held because we have made a decision that all special review districts should stop meeting at this time.",98,,
577,0.97,7252.578,7298.357,"Additionally, one of the amendments that we will speak of later is regarding the designation of historic designation, which has a process for public input . We have drafted an amendment to allow for the controls and incentives work to be done by staff, even without that designation being made so that we can continue having our staff working while we are in the state of civil emergency, and so that when these meetings or virtual meetings are able to take place, that final designation is able to occur, and then the controls and incentive work has already been done.",98,,
578,0.97,7298.357,7310.736,I welcome more of a Scalpel to approach rather than taking out an entire Department's worth of this ordinance.,98,,
579,0.97,7310.736,7313.906,Thank you.,98,,
580,0.97,7313.906,7314.44,Okay.,99,,
581,0.97,7314.44,7327.42,Any other questions or comments about the proposed substitute bill?,99,,
582,0.97,7327.42,7329.155,Thank you.,100,,
583,0.97,7329.155,7336.462,I want to thank the sponsored legislation for the offer he put out there.,100,,
584,0.97,7336.462,7352.278,"I am hoping Councilmember morale is, there is a handful of either districts or projects that you have in mind perhaps between now and this afternoon, the sponsor and you might be able to come back.",100,,
585,0.97,7352.278,7361.887,I appreciate his comment about needing more of a targeted approach and no there is a small handful of either areas or projects that you had in mind.,100,,
586,0.97,7361.887,7368.994,I look forward to having a more narrow amendment for our consideration this afternoon.,100,,
587,0.97,7368.994,7373.766,I just wanted to flag my support for that concept.,100,,
588,0.97,7373.766,7375.601,Thank you.,101,,
589,0.97,7375.601,7410.603,"I would also flag my support for that more narrowed approach . I want to reach out to the director of DOM to have a quick conversation with him about the impact of this particular substitute bill, which I saw for the first time yesterday, so I am just now, like many of my colleagues absorbing the content of the proposed substitute bill by Councilmember morale is.",101,,
590,0.97,7410.603,7462.188,"While I appreciate the attend, I think it is important for us to recognize that not all special review districts are created equal, and that while I agree that we need to make sure that we are centering equity and how these systems or processes are accessed, it is important for us to recognize that not all of the special review districts are created equal in terms of those equity issues, and thus, I think the tools that are needed to address equity issues are being flagged by Councilmember morale is and others need to be specifically catered as opposed to brushing a broad stroke here in all of these districts.",101,,
591,0.97,7462.188,7466.792,"I still have some questions before I feel like I support this direction, but I wanted to put that out for",101,,
592,0.97,7466.792,7486.378,"Can I ask for clarification? so this is actually for central staff, but I have a question about the certificate of approval process and its impacts or permitting affordable housing.",102,,
593,0.97,7486.378,7500.526,My understanding is that historic districts revived certificates of approval mostly poor projects that do not require permits . go ahead.,102,,
594,0.97,7500.526,7511.237,They sometimes do require approval for projects that do not require other types of Land- use permits.,103,,
595,0.97,7511.237,7529.555,"For example, you do not need to get a permit for a new sign from the Department of construction inspection, but that is reviewed by the landmarks board, or the special review district board.",103,,
596,0.97,7529.555,7547.673,"But many projects that are reviewed by those boards and commissions, including in particular new construction within a historic district, the landmarks approval is just one part of the total permitting package.",103,,
597,0.97,7547.673,7551.377,Okay.,104,,
598,0.97,7551.377,7551.777,Thank you.,104,,
599,0.97,7551.777,7560.052,I would be happy to talk with you all before 2 o'clock to see what we can do.,104,,
600,0.97,7560.052,7564.156,Great.,105,,
601,0.97,7564.156,7576.602,"If there are no other questions or comments on that bill, let's move to the next proposed amendment, which is I believe a substitute bill being proposed by Councilmember Strauss.",105,,
602,0.97,7576.602,7584.944,So there is a substitute.,106,,
603,0.97,7584.944,7611.036,Councilmember stresses substitute clarifies amendments and modifications to the officers authority and makes a couple of requests to STC I reports to the Council . The stress substitute has amendments that were initiated.,106,,
604,0.97,7611.036,7613.072,I will walk through each of these.,106,,
605,0.97,7613.072,7618.51,The first are largely Clarifications related to modifications to the design review program.,106,,
606,0.97,7618.51,7658.784,The first clarifies that the Seattle housing authority could avail themselves of the affordable housing exemption that is proposed in the bill that was transmitted . that exemption would exempt affordable housing projects and allow them to receive departures administratively from the director . affordable housing projects is to find that has to meet certain criteria including 40% of the income going to households earning 60% income after 40 years.,106,,
607,0.97,7658.784,7662.988,The projects have to make an application to STC I while the ordinance is an effect.,106,,
608,0.97,7662.988,7664.857,So within six months.,106,,
609,0.97,7664.857,7699.591,"The second amendment clarifies the type of qualifying Digital or electronic outreach for design review . Prior to early design guidance, there is a requirement that an applicant solicited input through community outreach . There is a rule that prescribes outreach, so this is a clarification that points to qualifying Digital and electronic outreach that would be when in person meetings can't occur.",106,,
610,0.97,7699.591,7706.732,The next four minutes modify the authority of the DOM director with certain administrative decisions.,106,,
611,0.97,7706.732,7745.37,"Among those decisions the Mayor proposed could be decisions about removal of hazard trees, take that authority out of the bill . It would also authorize the historic summation officer to make decisions about door and window replacement, called storefront treatments . It was also authorize the historic summation officer to administer the approved and House installations, where there are standards for the penthouse installations in the code for and Secretary of interior guidance and there is only one true in the square.",106,,
612,0.97,7745.37,7766.358,It would also authorize the officer to administratively approved certificates of approval when the final design subject to that certificate of approval has already gotten preliminary approval from the landmarks board and it does not deviate significantly from that approval.,106,,
613,0.97,7766.358,7773.499,"Finally, there are a couple of Nonqualified section, these are just requests to the executive side of the shop.",106,,
614,0.97,7773.499,7781.907,A world related to construction workplace safety in this time of Covid.,106,,
615,0.97,7781.907,7786.578,"We spoke to that one earlier, and finally a request to report from D.O.",106,,
616,0.97,7786.578,7799.124,And an progress towards standing out virtual meetings within 60 days . May 15 is the general Timeframe from which work will be delivered to the Council.,106,,
617,0.97,7799.124,7809.801,"& GT; before we open it up to questions and comments, I want to provide you an opportunity to speak to your substitute bill.",107,,
618,0.97,7809.801,7810.936,Thank you.,108,,
619,0.97,7810.936,7843.035,"This substitute bill is a direct product of your request to merge as many of the amendments as possible to create a smooth council meeting for this afternoon, and I could not have done this without Councilmember Covid, your input into this has been critical, and I must give both of you the majority of the credit for being able to have this substitute ready for this afternoon.",108,,
620,0.97,7843.035,7873.098,"What I say is that I am a the idea is that we allow staff to continue working as much as possible and permit or approved things that have only been already before the full body, if there are nuances or narrowing within this substitute, I welcome it because the passage of the overall bill is most important to me.",108,,
621,0.97,7873.098,7878.203,I do believe the elements regarding special review districts are important and I welcome any questions.,108,,
622,0.97,7878.203,7886.311,Any questions or comments?,109,,
623,0.97,7886.311,7886.778,All right.,109,,
624,0.97,7886.778,7926.752,"Seeing none, we will go ahead and move to the next amendment, which would be amendment, a substitute to Councilmember stresses substitute . I'm sorry, central steps should let us know that if Councilmember paralysis substitute bill failed, I am assuming this would be an alternative version.",109,,
625,0.97,7926.752,7931.423,Yes.,110,,
626,0.97,7931.423,7937.896,"If the substitute fails, you can move forward with Councilmember Strauss.",110,,
627,0.97,7937.896,7949.274,"There may be provisions within that substitute that could still move forward, but not all of the revisions in his substitute could.",110,,
628,0.97,7949.274,7957.416,Can me go through the substitute to the stress substitute version?,111,,
629,0.97,7957.416,8005.997,"Yes . So I think we are recommending pulling that version because if you act on the substitute either Ray, then you have considered that, and so there is not the alternative to review . Once you have considered the substitute once, I don't think there is the opportunity to come back and consider it again.",112,,
630,0.97,8005.997,8006.398,Okay.,113,,
631,0.97,8006.398,8014.106,So the item listed as sequence number three needs to be stricken?,113,,
632,0.97,8014.106,8014.339,Yes.,114,,
633,0.97,8014.339,8016.441,"Okay, so we will move on.",115,,
634,0.97,8016.441,8027.719,"Let's address then the next item, which would be mosquitoes amendment one.",115,,
635,0.97,8027.719,8037.462,This is one that Councilmember Mosqueda had described earlier.,116,,
636,0.97,8037.462,8039.865,This is an amendment that is related to continuity review.,116,,
637,0.97,8039.865,8052.811,It would allow projects that elect to go through administrative design review to the terms of the ordinance to stay if two circumstances are met.,116,,
638,0.97,8052.811,8069.995,"They could stay if they have completed the early design guidance phase of design review, or if the director determines that a return to full design review would push them back past the time limit for permit reviews set out in the code.",116,,
639,0.97,8069.995,8074.399,This is about half of the projects could probably avail themselves of this.,116,,
640,0.97,8074.399,8081.973,There are about 30 products currently in design review in the guidance phase.,116,,
641,0.97,8081.973,8085.811,Those of the project that could avail themselves of this.,116,,
642,0.97,8085.811,8087.412,"If you have any questions, I am",116,,
643,0.97,8087.412,8089.514,Thank you.,117,,
644,0.97,8089.514,8094.82,It looks like Councilmember Herbolt have a question.,117,,
645,0.97,8094.82,8102.127,"Before I open it up to questions, you would trust this particular amendment in your comments during your report.",117,,
646,0.97,8102.127,8104.463,Is there anything else you wanted to add?,117,,
647,0.97,8104.463,8105.197,Yes.,118,,
648,0.97,8105.197,8111.436,Thank you so much.,118,,
649,0.97,8111.436,8114.639,So I don't have much to add in terms of details you heard from central staff.,118,,
650,0.97,8114.639,8126.051,"I will say this amendment is an intent to make sure we are hitting the crux of the legislation, which is to create certainty and continuity and also adhering to the legal guidelines for the emergency legislation.",118,,
651,0.97,8126.051,8146.972,"So the intent here is to make sure that the progress that has been made and the work that is done during this time is not lost when there is change, and where we are able to hold in person meetings or virtual meetings again, we go ahead and do that, but we do not want to lose the good work that has been done.",118,,
652,0.97,8146.972,8160.752,I think that it is an effort to make sure that we don't waste time and resources by restarting . This amendment provides clarity in terms of guidelines on when a project may continue on the administrative are dying review tract.,118,,
653,0.97,8160.752,8169.561,I hope that is helpful and thank you again to central staff for your helpful work on this and the summary that you provided to counsel.,118,,
654,0.97,8169.561,8171.296,Appreciated.,118,,
655,0.97,8171.296,8172.364,Okay.,119,,
656,0.97,8172.364,8176.868,I saw your hand go up with a question or comment.,119,,
657,0.97,8176.868,8178.17,"Yes, thank you.",120,,
658,0.97,8178.17,8207.899,"As far as the timing when this decision may be made to allow these affordable housing projects, I'm sorry, for any project that he likes to go through administrative design review Tesday and that track, when is the brackets for when the director would make that permissive decision to allow those projects to continue their administrative design review?",120,,
659,0.97,8207.899,8219.044,Would those decisions be made at a time that we are no longer in a crisis where meetings can't occur?,120,,
660,0.97,8219.044,8232.924,"Or is it just restricted to that period of time, this period of time when we are unable to have meetings.",120,,
661,0.97,8232.924,8233.858,There we go.,121,,
662,0.97,8233.858,8244.169,"This change would only be in effect for 180 days, unless that is modified by the Council later this afternoon.",121,,
663,0.97,8244.169,8267.926,"So as the bill is proposed requires that project switch back at the earlier of three points, one is when the bill is no longer effective, which is 180 days, when virtual meetings recommends or when in person meetings start with comply with public health guidance.",121,,
664,0.97,8267.926,8294.185,"If you are in project now that received an early design guidance decision with the board and you availed yourself of administrative design review, and virtual meetings were stood up before the bill expires, you would not be able to take advantage of the proposed amendment.",121,,
665,0.97,8294.185,8320.612,"However, if you have not completed early design guidance and you go through early design guidance or you have already gone through early design guidance, so you got guidance from that land use plan or the board, if you are lucky enough to have gotten that already, then you could avail yourself of this amendment and get a decision through administrative design review without board input.",121,,
666,0.97,8320.612,8322.047,I am not sure if that answers,121,,
667,0.97,8322.047,8326.951,I think it does.,122,,
668,0.97,8326.951,8334.759,"So the bill as drafted, the authority for it last for six months.",122,,
669,0.97,8334.759,8359.718,"But if we are able, if folks are able to resume in person meetings and three months, but they have already, the project has already received its early design review guidance in two months, it is able to continue along the administrative design review pass?",122,,
670,0.97,8359.718,8360.018,Correct.,123,,
671,0.97,8360.018,8366.191,Thank you.,124,,
672,0.97,8366.191,8373.598,"Okay, any other questions or comments about the amendment?",125,,
673,0.97,8373.598,8378.47,I have one and it is more process oriented.,125,,
674,0.97,8378.47,8400.925,"So is this particular amendment in conflict with something in the stress substitute, or is it just not seen as a friendly amendment or was it a Standalone?",125,,
675,0.97,8400.925,8403.561,"As a sponsor of the bill, this is a very unfriendly amendment.",126,,
676,0.97,8403.561,8406.798,So friendly I almost sponsored it myself.,126,,
677,0.97,8406.798,8411.836,Sharing the wealth in our ability to make this a better bill.,126,,
678,0.97,8411.836,8414.205,Okay.,127,,
679,0.97,8414.205,8422.046,So there is nothing in this bill that would conflict with the substitute bill?,127,,
680,0.97,8422.046,8425.65,It does not conflict with the substitute bill.,128,,
681,0.97,8425.65,8431.556,It is a question for Councilmembers about whether or not it is a big enough change that it arises to a policy,128,,
682,0.97,8431.556,8444.369,"Thank you, I appreciate that verification from a process point of view, and if there are no other questions or comments, we will move on to the next amendment.",129,,
683,0.97,8444.369,8450.108,"Seeing and hearing none, let's move to Herbolt amendment one.",129,,
684,0.97,8450.108,8462.153,So Herbolt amendment one would Delete the proposed provision that Exempts affordable housing projects that meets certain requirements from design review.,130,,
685,0.97,8462.153,8479.404,"Projects, affordable housing projects are certainly subject to a Penetrative design review, so there are no in person meetings required for this project, so this is just a choice about the policy put in front of the counsel.",130,,
686,0.97,8479.404,8482.974,So I will translate what I think I heard you say in terms of the policy choice.,131,,
687,0.97,8482.974,8492.517,Herbolt amendment one conflicts with Mosqueda amendment one.,131,,
688,0.97,8492.517,8493.518,It does not.,132,,
689,0.97,8493.518,8494.886,They can both be acted on together.,132,,
690,0.97,8494.886,8503.394,This is in a separate section of Chapter 2341. it is not in conflict with each other.,132,,
691,0.97,8503.394,8511.336,The Mayor has invited the Council to make a policy choice here about affordable housing projects and exempting them from design review on an emergency basis.,132,,
692,0.97,8511.336,8528.853,So Herbolt's amendment would not afford affordable housing projects the opportunity to be exempt.,132,,
693,0.97,8528.853,8531.055,"It would not exempt them from design review, is that",133,,
694,0.97,8531.055,8533.124,Correct.,134,,
695,0.97,8533.124,8534.158,They would still go through,134,,
696,0.97,8534.158,8539.03,Got it.,135,,
697,0.97,8539.03,8540.865,Would you like to speak to your proposed amendment?,135,,
698,0.97,8540.865,8543.034,Thank you.,136,,
699,0.97,8543.034,8549.374,"Thank you for the clarity that it is not in conflict with amendment one, which I am inclined to support.",136,,
700,0.97,8549.374,8565.189,So my amendment proposes to Delete the provision that Exempts affordable housing projects from meeting certain requirements as required by administrative design review.,136,,
701,0.97,8565.189,8573.965,Administrative design review has been in place only since July of 2018.,136,,
702,0.97,8573.965,8581.573,Revisiting administrative design review for affordable housing projects might be a good policy discussion.,136,,
703,0.97,8581.573,8602.66,"I believe strongly it does not fall within the corners of the governor's proclamation 2028 issued in February . again, as we know, affordable housing projects are currently subject to administrative design review.",136,,
704,0.97,8602.66,8628.353,"This does not require in person meetings, and so the fact that these bills are really focused on the current emergency associated with the inability to have in person meetings, I believe this is out of the scope of the legislation that we are permitted to hear at this particular time.",136,,
705,0.97,8628.353,8655.847,"The findings in the bill itself say that the ordinance provides an exemption from design review and it goes on to say exempting these projects from design review and limiting, allowing limited the purchase to be granted outside of the design review process will shorten the time required for these projects to be complete, to complete the process.",136,,
706,0.97,8655.847,8663.087,Advancing the date by which they can be constructed and the allotted departures seek to increase the number of affordable housing units.,136,,
707,0.97,8663.087,8674.499,"All worthy goals, but this is the term that central staff uses is a temporal shift.",136,,
708,0.97,8674.499,8694.519,"This finding is related to recovery, it is not related to addressing the public health challenge posed by in person meeting requirements on the will of boards and commissions, and finally, there might be some real time savings realized, but the delivery of units associated with those permits would be a year or more away.",136,,
709,0.97,8694.519,8700.024,"I take the guidance from the state Attorney General, and the governor very seriously.",136,,
710,0.97,8700.024,8719.377,"We have two paths, we can hear the legislation or received reports and briefings on issues that are necessary and routine, or legislation that is necessary to respond to the Covid outbreak and public health emergency.",136,,
711,0.97,8719.377,8722.046,I believe this section of the bill does neither.,136,,
712,0.97,8722.046,8743.768,"I have checked with doctor Terkel so, he has confirmed for me that all affordable housing projects are currently expedited, Prioritized in the design review process, as well as throughout the entire permitting process.",136,,
713,0.97,8743.768,8781.572,"They will continue to be Prioritized through the Ministry to design review and entire permitting process and I have also confirmed with director total so that the affordable housing projects mentioned in his memo from last week located in Lake City, but her leg, Columbia city and Regnier Beach, these projects not only have a priority in the administrative design review process, but all of them will be able to complete the early community engagement process as required.",136,,
714,0.97,8781.572,8811.536,"Again, I feel this amendment is not about whether or not it might be good public policy to exempt affordable housing projects from administrative design review, but it is coming from a place where I strongly believe that we need to adhere to the spirit and the letter of the proclamation issued by the governor as well as the accompanying guidance from the state Attorney General.",136,,
715,0.97,8811.536,8814.038,Thank you.,136,,
716,0.97,8814.038,8822.28,"Strauss, I see you have raised your hand, so I will yield the floor to you.",137,,
717,0.97,8822.28,8822.947,Thank you.,138,,
718,0.97,8822.947,8825.85,I really appreciate your comments.,138,,
719,0.97,8825.85,8833.891,I also started in the same place as you because I do not want to the items that are extraneous to this bill being included.,138,,
720,0.97,8833.891,8843.234,I agree that these are smart policy Discussons that we should take up for a Nonemergency matter at a different time.,138,,
721,0.97,8843.234,8865.456,"The reason the intersection that you did not discuss that I see as being central to the reason this is included in this bill is if we are taking a trudge over that is usually done by volunteers and shifting that onto staff, then that staff has a larger amount of work with the same amount of people.",138,,
722,0.97,8865.456,8879.904,"So while the directors Email says that Ftca gives permit, and I don't know if I need permission to read from the Email, they give priority permitting for affordable housing products when 100% of the units are affordable for the entire process.",138,,
723,0.97,8879.904,8886.577,I agree this is the policy choice and position of the city of Seattle.,138,,
724,0.97,8886.577,8914.739,"I believe that if we again continued to require, if we moved a trudge of volunteer work into stop work and have not given the staff any relief, then we have really funneled a lot of pressure onto those staff, and I think it is important for us to walk our talk I and Prioritize affordable housing to continue moving forward.",138,,
725,0.97,8914.739,8915.673,Can I respond to that?,139,,
726,0.97,8915.673,8921.913,"My final comment is again, my overall goal for today is that this bill passes.",140,,
727,0.97,8921.913,8938.162,"I think this is a smart policy choice to make during this bill for the reason that I outlined previously, and I will reiterate my overall goal for today is for this bill to",140,,
728,0.97,8938.162,8940.665,"Herbolt, you would like to respond.",141,,
729,0.97,8940.665,8958.883,I want to reiterate that the findings in the bill that support our action on this section of the bill are really focused on time savings associated with the design review process.,142,,
730,0.97,8958.883,8969.393,Time savings that are translated into staff time.,142,,
731,0.97,8969.393,8984.575,It is absolutely correct that the same number of staff reviewing more projects is going to create potentially a bottleneck.,142,,
732,0.97,8984.575,9002.793,"We know affordable housing units will be Prioritized in the bottleneck, but again, our findings in our bill talks about delivery of units for people who need housing, and the delivery of those units will be a year or more away.",142,,
733,0.97,9002.793,9011.635,These are the findings that we are using to justify on this session of the bill.,142,,
734,0.97,9011.635,9032.156,"If there are findings that are about, and I quote responding to the Covid outbreak and current public health emergency, we have to reflect that the legislation that we are voting on is addressing think that are happening right now.",142,,
735,0.97,9032.156,9033.057,"As it stands now, the",142,,
736,0.97,9033.057,9044.635,Are you suggesting that your amendment addresses that gap in the legislation?,143,,
737,0.97,9044.635,9056.48,"By striking the part of the legislation that is not necessary to respond to the outbreak and current public health emergency, yes.",144,,
738,0.97,9056.48,9059.083,Thank you.,145,,
739,0.97,9059.083,9062.686,I appreciate that clarification.,145,,
740,0.97,9062.686,9064.288,I saw that you raised your hand.,145,,
741,0.97,9064.288,9070.461,The floor is yours.,145,,
742,0.97,9070.461,9071.395,Thank you so much.,146,,
743,0.97,9071.395,9073.697,I appreciate where you are coming from on this as well.,146,,
744,0.97,9073.697,9119.543,"I think that our goal is the same to make sure that we are doing everything we can to respond to the public health crisis, and as a Council President has asked us to do, we narrow our thought . I think it is a matter of perspective here as the sheriff housing and coming from a public health background, I think the intent that I would love to see and remember in this discussion is to make sure that we have all resources available to respond to the crisis, and I think the point that affordable housing and housing in general is a public health solution to the crisis of Covid is slightly being lost.",146,,
745,0.97,9119.543,9121.045,I understand where you are coming from.,146,,
746,0.97,9121.045,9127.451,I think my concern with the amendment as has been outlined is it is precisely because we know that housing projects take a year or more.,146,,
747,0.97,9127.451,9146.37,"Because of that, we need to meet the need now and because of the trajectory that it takes to approve affordable housing, I am concerned that any sort of bottleneck that results in delays a year from now could impact our ability to house and treat and isolate people who made the affected by Covid.",146,,
748,0.97,9146.37,9164.688,"In my opinion, having affordable housing as part of this package here is a critical four hours response to Covid, while those housing units might be on the horizon, we still don't know if we will have a vaccine in 18 months.",146,,
749,0.97,9164.688,9181.405,"We still don't know how and Visuals who have been affected by Covid right now may or may not see Remission, and we also know on top of that as you have done a strong advocate of, we had housing crisis before this.",146,,
750,0.97,9181.405,9205.129,"I think our region has a need to make sure we are moving forward, including affordable housing and everything we can to expedite the process . I feel confident that this will be included and we can make sure we get these projects up and running, especially given the long nature in which we have seen housing projects go forward.",146,,
751,0.97,9205.129,9206.13,I hear what you are saying.,146,,
752,0.97,9206.13,9218.509,I understand we want to be specific to the current public health crisis in front of us in my perspective including by creating additional housing.,146,,
753,0.97,9218.509,9222.613,I wanted to weigh in on where I was coming from with my concerns about the amendment.,146,,
754,0.97,9222.613,9242.166,"I want to say that I think your points in general around the Governors proclamation and the order are well-made, and I think accepted in the spirit that they are being offered.",147,,
755,0.97,9242.166,9268.692,"I think it is really important for us to make sure that as we advance of this bill, that we make sure that we are communicating very clearly to the agencies that it is our absolute expectation and requirement that the issues related to virtual public meetings of the design review board and the historic boards be addressed within a reasonable period of time after passage.",147,,
756,0.97,9268.692,9307.031,"I think that there are now portions of the bill that give me confidence that that will occur and more importantly, I think we have received a strong representation from the executives that they will dig into identifying ways to stand up and set up virtual public meetings within a reasonable period of time, but I absolutely agree with you that it is important for us to make sure that we are transparent and narrow in our application of the governor's order.",147,,
757,0.97,9307.031,9320.844,"I will say that I appreciated for the first time last week, on Friday that the Governors proclamation is only in effect until April 23.",147,,
758,0.97,9320.844,9331.722,"Which for those of you who are following the calendar, that is in three days.",147,,
759,0.97,9331.722,9332.323,The proclamation expires.,147,,
760,0.97,9332.323,9338.962,I have had conversations with the governor's office about whether or not that proclamation and its directives will be extended beyond the 23rd.,147,,
761,0.97,9338.962,9404.194,"I have not received a firm response as to whether or not it will be extended beyond 23 April . My understanding is that it requires bipartisan support and approval in order to extend those types of proclamations, and so if that is not obtained by the 23rd, then we could find ourselves in a situation where the provisions that we are debating right now become a little bit more complex and more Nuanced in terms of how to move forward so just be aware that there is an open question that is a massive variable that is not within our control related to the ongoing applicability of the Governors order proclamation as it relates to public gatherings and public facilities alike set to expire on 23 April and we are waiting to see if it will be extended.",147,,
762,0.97,9404.194,9416.173,"I know that I have made a request that it be extended to be consistent with the current shelter in place order issued by the governor and I know that the King County has issued a similar request, but it does require bipartisan support.",147,,
763,0.97,9416.173,9443.967,"As we saw over the weekend, there are members on the Republican side who are now protesting ongoing shelter and place orders, including right here in our own state, so it is unclear to me how the politics will bleed into what should otherwise be an Apolitical conversation around public gatherings and our public response to the emergency.",147,,
764,0.97,9443.967,9453.811,I want to flag that and make sure that folks understood there is a variable floating out there that could impact the conversation we are currently having.,147,,
765,0.97,9453.811,9456.38,Thank you.,148,,
766,0.97,9456.38,9479.136,I do just want to circle back to reiterating I was in the same place as you about a week ago because I do not want to expand this bill beyond directly responding to the crisis.,148,,
767,0.97,9479.136,9507.531,"The reason we did not include this information, or I did not request this information to be included in the findings of the bill, or in the memos regarding design review is because that is where I thought the majority of the questions were still in place, and so I was not swayed until I had a more firm understanding of the impact on our staff time, as a response to the Covid crisis, and that is what changed my opinion from where you are today.",148,,
768,0.97,9507.531,9510.234,"Again, looking to see passage of the overall bill is most important.",148,,
769,0.97,9510.234,9514.438,"Okay colleague, it is 12:11.",149,,
770,0.97,9514.438,9532.823,"I know we will start losing some Councilmembers here and we are only halfway through our preview of what to expect this afternoon, and on Councilmember reports.",149,,
771,0.97,9532.823,9535.559,So I am going to have us move along to the list.,149,,
772,0.97,9535.559,9540.43,We have three more amendments to discuss on this particular counsel bill.,149,,
773,0.97,9540.43,9549.306,So I am going to ask that we moved to the Herbolt and stress amendment six.,149,,
774,0.97,9549.306,9552.142,This amendment is related to the historic preservation part of the bill.,150,,
775,0.97,9552.142,9561.018,"Belly and marking process for a structure site, involves a Multistep process.",150,,
776,0.97,9561.018,9572.996,The project is nominated to be considered as a landmark if it meets the criteria of the landmarks board designates it as a landmark.,150,,
777,0.97,9572.996,9584.775,Only once that designation has been approved does the staff start to negotiate the specific elements of the landmark that need to be preserved.,150,,
778,0.97,9584.775,9602.693,"This amendment allows for that negotiation to start happening for those five or six potential landmarks that have gone through the nomination stage, but not yet been designated landmarks.",150,,
779,0.97,9602.693,9615.806,So hopefully it will shorten some time at the Backend once the landmarks board is up and running to allow them to quickly consider that designation and status agreement.,150,,
780,0.97,9615.806,9622.746,Thank you.,151,,
781,0.97,9622.746,9625.048,"Councilmember Herbolt or Strauss, would you like to address the amendment?",151,,
782,0.97,9625.048,9629.219,I want to say I appreciated working with Councilmember Strauss on this amendment.,152,,
783,0.97,9629.219,9678.101,"This was a proposal that was brought forward from an affordable housing provider, and I also worked with historic Seattle and trying to address any concerns that they had with the concept, and Lish in his infinite wisdom came up with another approach that satisfies both the affordable housing provider as it relates to their project, and historic Seattle, and I am anticipating Council President Gonzales that since this is cosponsored by myself and Councilmember Strauss that you might want to roll it into the substitute, and I have no objections to doing so.",152,,
784,0.97,9678.101,9680.003,Thank you.,153,,
785,0.97,9680.003,9681.805,Really appreciate that.,153,,
786,0.97,9681.805,9685.642,"Strauss, would you like to address this amendment?",153,,
787,0.97,9685.642,9692.315,Just to say that I had an initial amendment drafted that would get at the intent of this.,154,,
788,0.97,9692.315,9698.722,Councilmember Herbolt's input made this more Nuanced and a better amendment overall.,154,,
789,0.97,9698.722,9704.127,This would not be in place today without Councilmember Herbolt.,154,,
790,0.97,9704.127,9710.1,Any questions or comments from my colleagues about the Herbolt and Strauss amendment?,155,,
791,0.97,9710.1,9725.749,We will move to the Herbolt amendment 2. who from counsel central staff will address that?,155,,
792,0.97,9725.749,9731.421,"It might make sense, since we are pressed for time, maybe talk about 2 and 3 together.",156,,
793,0.97,9731.421,9735.926,Why don't we do that.,157,,
794,0.97,9735.926,9736.927,Is that you?,157,,
795,0.97,9736.927,9741.832,Yes.,158,,
796,0.97,9741.832,9748.138,Aendment 2 would reduce the term of the temporary changes made by the bill from 180 days to 60 days.,158,,
797,0.97,9748.138,9754.177,Amendment three in some ways may be an alternative to amendment 2. I will let Herbolt speak to her intention here.,158,,
798,0.97,9754.177,9785.609,"This amendment would make changes to the aspects of the bill that are administered by the Department of neighborhoods that stressed that they would mirror the visions, specifically the health authority grant to the board, or the suspension of board meetings would be for 60 days, when virtual meetings are possible and when in person meetings resume that improve public health guidance.",158,,
799,0.97,9785.609,9789.112,"Great, thank you.",159,,
800,0.97,9789.112,9791.848,Would you like to address these amendments?,159,,
801,0.97,9791.848,9792.115,Yes.,160,,
802,0.97,9792.115,9824.848,"I think again that the intent is really the same, but being made in different parts of the bill, amendment 2 would reduce the term of the temporary changes made by the bill from six months to two months, and amendment three would modify the suspension of meetings to the earlier of 60 days when virtual meetings are possible or when in person meetings resume.",160,,
803,0.97,9824.848,9871.094,"The intent of both of these amendments is to recognize that the Council feels urgency on the part of encouraging as TCI, and DOM to stand up virtual meetings to take public comments on both administrative design review and the landmark process and if for some reason in two months, we have found that that was not enough time to stand up these virtual meetings, which I find that hard to believe, we could Revisit this ordinance at that time.",160,,
804,0.97,9871.094,9873.863,Thank you.,160,,
805,0.97,9873.863,9879.603,Any questions or comments?,161,,
806,0.97,9879.603,9880.103,Councilmember Strauss.,161,,
807,0.97,9880.103,9899.389,"Thank you . I will say that amendment number two, reducing the time from six months to two months is not something that I support . amendment number three, I do support.",162,,
808,0.97,9899.389,9943.133,"So understanding that there is that difference, and the reason that I can't at this time support a reduction down to two months in part was much like the amendment we were discussing a moment ago, I started in the same place as Councilmember Herbolt and I know that Councilmember Lewis brought up these concerns as well, where when I took a first Blush at this bill, I thought Why don't we reduce the time to two months or three months and I was reminded that as part of Land-Use, we must have public hearings as part of 30 day notice, and so this is going to be the only emergency bill that we will be passing regarding these Land-Use decisions.",162,,
809,0.97,9943.133,9989.212,"The length of time that these decisions need to be made for the six month, and the reason for that is with design review process is usually taking about a year, this covers half of that LifeSpan, provides us the ability to know that if this cannot be resolved by the time our Council budget process begins, that there will not be an opportunity to bring this back up for additional discussion, and so it really puts the onus on these departments to create the avenues of virtual meetings and the other avenues that we have discussed in the bill.",162,,
810,0.97,9989.212,9997.52,I need much more than two months to feel this is being a good use of our time.,162,,
811,0.97,9997.52,10000.724,My request is six months.,162,,
812,0.97,10000.724,10003.126,"Again, amendment number three, I am in full support of.",162,,
813,0.97,10003.126,10005.428,Thank you.,162,,
814,0.97,10005.428,10012.335,Any other questions or comments on these amendments?,163,,
815,0.97,10012.335,10013.536,"Okay, I am not seeing any.",163,,
816,0.97,10013.536,10098.354,"Colleagues, we have some work that needs to get done on some of these amendments before 2 o'clock today . I appreciate all of the work being done by Councilmembers and the prime sponsor on this particular bill to address the realities of Land-Use issues that's our present for us regardless of the public health crisis, and because of the public health crisis, we need to be conscientious of these processes, which have historically required and appended on a lot of public engagement and public input in person, and because that is prohibited currently, it makes this body of work complicated, and so I think at the end of the day, this counsel bill is identified by Councilmember Strauss is intended to address that reality, that conflict in the body of work that we are doing and the public health orders that we are navigating through, so I hope that we are able to come to a resolution before 2 o'clock today that will allow us to meet that sure intent and to do so in a way that is the most reasonable and rational way to do it in a narrow sense.",163,,
817,0.97,10098.354,10110.033,"So I think we have some thinking to do on this complex bill, and hopefully we will be able to find some resolution by this afternoon.",163,,
818,0.97,10110.033,10113.269,So I will go ahead and move us along.,163,,
819,0.97,10113.269,10123.246,I think that concludes Councilmember Strauss report.,163,,
820,0.97,10123.246,10129.152,"On his committee work, so I will move over to Councilmember Herbolt, the floor is yours.",163,,
821,0.97,10129.152,10135.158,"Thank you to Lish and pedal for joining us this morning, you are free to hang up and leave the meeting if you wish.",163,,
822,0.97,10135.158,10141.931,You will not be required to attend full counsel unless you hear otherwise from me.,163,,
823,0.97,10141.931,10146.169,"For now, thank you for being available to answer questions.",163,,
824,0.97,10146.169,10156.379,"Councilmember Herbolt, the floor is yours.",163,,
825,0.97,10156.379,10157.147,Thank you so much.,164,,
826,0.97,10157.147,10182.105,"A couple things I want to mention as far as activities coming up, and over the last week, just a heads up to everybody here that next week, working with the Seattle women's Commission will be presenting a proclamation on sexual assault awareness month and denim day for counsel signatures, so that will be next Monday.",164,,
827,0.97,10182.105,10203.226,"And then also last week, I want to share with folks that I had a call with about a dozen district 1 service providers, representing food things, immunity banks, organizations, Healthcare, housing providers to senior centers and more.",164,,
828,0.97,10203.226,10218.708,"We discussed the changes that they are seeing in the communities that we serve, changes they are making an operations and programming impacts of those changes on their staff, and the needs and gaps that they are identifying in this very difficult time.",164,,
829,0.97,10218.708,10275.665,"One of the common concerns that I have heard from folks, and I know we all continue to hear this out in the community, but there is a need for continued support in purchasing and attempting to connect to centralized purchasing at the city as it relates specifically to Ppe and masks, and some of the providers were aware of that combined purchasing that they are facilitating, some are not, but even those who were Availing themselves of that citywide purchasing power, we are still feeling that the orders they have been putting in for Ppe have been coming up short as far as what their needs are.",164,,
830,0.97,10275.665,10323.346,"And then one of the other big issues that was identified in the call was the need for outreach in Spanish-Speaking communities about the importance of using masks and gloves as it relates specifically to markets . The observation was made that both customers and workers in some of the ethnic market and South Park, you do not see as prevailing of a use of masks, as you would for instance in West Seattle.",164,,
831,0.97,10323.346,10341.664,"So just wanting to identify that, and as we mentioned earlier, we hope folks can join us at the electronic town hall on the West Seattle bridge on Wednesday from 5-6:30 P.M.",164,,
832,0.97,10341.664,10342.432,That is it for me.,164,,

835,0.97,10343.433,10345.935,Any questions or comments on that report?,165,,
836,0.97,10345.935,10356.245,"We are going to move swiftly along . So Councilmember Lawrence, unfortunately had to leave the call since we are going so long.",165,,
837,0.97,10356.245,10361.551,So she will provide her report next week.,165,,
838,0.97,10361.551,10366.389,"I appreciate her hanging on for as long as she could, and we will go ahead and move on now",165,,

841,0.97,10374.163,10433.656,"So first, I want to report in response to some of your remarks in your report, it was really great having you on a call that I had with several Seattle service providers regarding follow-up from my committee meeting a week and a half ago regarding the city's efforts to stand up hygiene investments, it was really good to have that conversation with service providers with ongoing needs, and the things that have not been provided since that committee meeting . I did just want to flag for the general public and for colleagues who may be unaware that there were six new hygiene stations announced last week by the executive . one in Georgetown, one in the same Vincent food Bank, one at Steinman Park, one at the waterfront Park, one at 45Th, when at the University heights center and one at Bell Street park.",166,,
842,0.97,10433.656,10435.658,These new investments are obviously very welcome.,166,,
843,0.97,10435.658,10479.101,"They are still not sufficient to divide response to the level of demand that we are seeing based on the reports I have heard from service providers and community members . I have been working closely with Councilmember Strauss on trying to get a bigger movement on resources it to the ongoing hygiene challenges, continuing to work on one of the big Takeaways from that committee meeting, which was to focus on figuring out strategies to open some of our public buildings, including libraries that have water supply in them.",166,,
844,0.97,10479.101,10479.936,Those efforts are ongoing.,166,,
845,0.97,10479.936,10545.868,"I will continue to follow up on some of the key Takeaways from that council meeting, and I didn't want to flag the process that has been made in terms of the hygiene stations that have been secured to play there will be more updates this week and going into next week . Just wanted to briefly mention on the introduction referral calendar, there is a number of appointments to the auditing group that is going to be meeting remotely . I believe their resumes have been circulated and it is a good group of folks, including former auditors from King County as well as the city of Portland, members of organized labor, academics at the Evans school, and community members, so really appreciate having a conversation next week, and just looking forward to Councilmember hearing on Wednesday . and looking forward to another week of Council action during this public health crisis .

856,0.97,10613.336,10649.171,"Already discussed our substitute for this afternoon, so I just want to say quickly that we do continue virtual office hours in the District from Friday's, on Fridays from 10-Noon and tomorrow we will be participating in a tenant town hall .

861,0.97,10660.483,10664.353,Our committee meetings are canceled until further notice.,169,,
862,0.97,10664.353,10748.337,"There was an intention by my office to bring forth counsel bills 119761 and 119762, which are the bills related to creating a new Eviction defense and are just cause ordinance for residential landlord tenant agreement, so this was sort of similar to the legislation we took action on last week that was sponsored by Councilmember Herbolt related to commercial tendencies, but we of course saw great news coming out of the governor's office implementing the new policy of rent payment plans statewide, that is a conversation I had with the governor's office last Friday, so it was really appreciative of the opportunity to be able to share a copy of our proposed bill and have a conversation with them and see the governor and his folks implement that important policies statewide was really an important step forward in responding to the realities of the needs of people who are having a hard time figuring out how they are going to pay the rent when they can't work as a result of the closures statewide.",169,,
863,0.97,10748.337,10753.542,So we will be taking next steps on those bills.,169,,
864,0.97,10753.542,10778.1,"I still intend to bring them forward and it is just the extension of the moratorium and other aspects of the governor's order give us a little bit of time and I think it is important for us to do a crosswalk between what we just saw, under the governor's order and what is included in my proposed counsel bills before we take any final action on that.",169,,
865,0.97,10778.1,10797.82,"My hope is we will continue to evaluate what the impacts of those orders are on our policy, still intend to move them forward, but we will make sure that we are fully evaluating those bills to identify any gaps or further opportunities in terms of the policy direction of those bills.",169,,
866,0.97,10797.82,10811.2,"Hopefully we will be able to have something in the next couple of weeks, as soon as we have an opportunity to absorb the particular details of the governor's order on the issues that are touched on in these counsel bills.",169,,

871,0.97,10836.892,10864.753,"Sometimes these meetings can go a little bit longer because of the remote nature of how we are meeting, but I really do appreciate you all hanging in there, and continuing to be engaged, and allowing me the opportunity to think of Council Cravings and a little bit more of a creative ways we can have these policy conversations.",169,,
872,0.97,10864.753,10878.467,"I think it is important for us to have those conversations in this less formal setting in order to that some of these important policy issues, especially since we are not having committee meetings.",169,,
