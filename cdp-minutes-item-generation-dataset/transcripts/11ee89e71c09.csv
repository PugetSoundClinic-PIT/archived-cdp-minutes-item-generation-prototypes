137,0.97,524.323,534.0,We are continuously looking for ways to fine tune this remote process and adding new feature that is will allow for additional means of public participation in our Council meetings.,84,,
138,0.97,534.0,539.639,It remains the strong intent of the city Council to have public comment regularly included on meeting Agendas.,84,,

146,0.97,592.591,600.666,"Once I call a Speaker's name, staff will Unmute the appropriate microphone and you will hear a prompt of you have been Unmuted.",84,,
147,0.97,600.666,610.71,That will be the Speaker's Cue that it is their turn to hit Star six and begin speaking.,84,,
148,0.97,610.71,620.786,"Again, when you hear the prompt of you have been Unmuted, that's the Speaker's Cue to press Star six in order to begin speaking.",84,,
149,0.97,620.786,634.0,"Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item that you are addressing as a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction and referral calendar or the Council's 2020 work program.",84,,

151,0.97,636.869,644.944,And that means you have ten second left of the two minutes that you have been allotted to provide the Council with public Congressmen.,84,,
152,0.97,644.944,649.348,"Once you hear that Chime, I'd ask that you please begin to wrap up your public comment.",84,,
153,0.97,649.348,661.861,"If a Speaker does not end their comments at the end of the allotted time provided, which in this case is two minutes, the Speaker's microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next Speaker.",84,,

221,0.97,1052.284,1056.889,I'm calling about share legislation to raise pay for TNC drivers.,97,,
222,0.97,1056.889,1076.642,"It has been, I believe now, about six years since I and many other drivers first met with the Seattle city council about this issue, and in that six years, drivers have watched their income drop approximately 50% from what it was around 2014, 2015.",97,,
223,0.97,1076.642,1083.782,"So a year ago, drivers stood with Mayor Durkan when she announced the fare share legislation almost a year ago.",97,,
224,0.97,1083.782,1096.128,"In that year, the city has reached out to over 10,000 drivers via surveys, Teleconferences and personal meetings with Stakeholders.",97,,
225,0.97,1096.128,1106.438,"And in the meetings with these and data gathered from these 10,000 drivers, we've come to the proposal which the Mayor is putting forth.",97,,
226,0.97,1106.438,1112.344,"With the driver Union, for the most part, really liked the proposal.",97,,
227,0.97,1112.344,1118.217,We would like to see some modest amendments going forward in the weeks and we'd like to be working with you on that.,97,,
228,0.97,1118.217,1126.725,We would like to see an increase in the mileage rate as well as the minutes rate and increase in the minimum fare.,97,,
229,0.97,1126.725,1128.994,Those are two very important things.,97,,
230,0.97,1128.994,1137.536,And we think modest improvement would go a long ways to returning these to the middle class jobs they once were.,97,,
231,0.97,1137.536,1141.74,"As it stands right now, the proposal will raise pay about 30%.",97,,
232,0.97,1141.74,1142.774,We're happy with that.,97,,
233,0.97,1142.774,1152.551,"That sounds very good, but do keep in mind that over the years drivers' pay has been cut by about 50%.",97,,
234,0.97,1152.551,1167.065,"In August, for example, August 2014, August 1ST, drivers' pay was cut 20% on that day--I think my two minutes are about up.",97,,
235,0.97,1167.065,1168.066,Thank you very much.,97,,
236,0.97,1168.066,1173.505,Thank you so much for calling in today.,98,,
237,0.97,1173.505,1178.911,Next up Megan cruise followed by fauna.,98,,
238,0.97,1178.911,1180.312,"Hello, I'm Megan cruise.",99,,
239,0.97,1180.312,1193.859,I'm calling to request an amendment to CB 119835 supporting the public process by keeping decision making authority over conditional use of landmarks with the landmarks board.,99,,
240,0.97,1193.859,1204.636,I also want to address CB 119877 described as extending virtual meetings for design review in the Department of neighborhoods.,99,,
241,0.97,1204.636,1206.171,"This, unfortunately, is Disingenuous.",99,,
242,0.97,1206.171,1223.989,"The original Covid emergency bill allowed projects requiring public design review to opt for internal administrative review for, quote, the six-month duration of the ordinance or until such earlier time the city has put in operation a system to host meetings virtually.",99,,
243,0.97,1223.989,1227.559,"Thankfully, those meetings started in early August.",99,,
244,0.97,1227.559,1229.728,The first two went very well.,99,,
245,0.97,1229.728,1230.495,Mission accomplished and good job.,99,,
246,0.97,1230.495,1240.973,The true purpose of this bill is to extend the same Public-Free review for developers who aren't eligible and want the same treatment.,99,,
247,0.97,1240.973,1249.047,This legislation uses emergency bills to create long-term changes that benefit developers at the expense of the public.,99,,
248,0.97,1249.047,1251.216,And developers don't need more incentives.,99,,
249,0.97,1251.216,1261.56,"Building permits boomed after this legislation was passed and it was led by big projects, the kind that exactly need and benefit from public input.",99,,
250,0.97,1261.56,1265.597,Please hold to your pledge to make public participation the rule once again.,99,,
251,0.97,1265.597,1274.072,Extending and expanding this legislation shows Seattle is bound by a system so beholden to developers that it can't afford to let people speak publicly.,99,,
252,0.97,1274.072,1274.573,Thank you.,99,,
253,0.97,1274.573,1277.776,Thank you for calling in.,100,,

258,0.97,1299.531,1302.034,We need fair pay to sustain our personal life.,101,,
259,0.97,1302.034,1309.641,"As we all know, the cost of living in Seattle is going up every year.",101,,
260,0.97,1309.641,1316.114,"For example, our rent goes up yearly since our income is going down yearly.",101,,
261,0.97,1316.114,1324.122,I also mentioned that my husband drives for Uber as well since we are expecting our third child.,101,,
262,0.97,1324.122,1328.126,He's the only one who's driving right now.,101,,
263,0.97,1328.126,1334.399,"In addition to that, he drives a very long, long, long hours to cover our expenses.",101,,
264,0.97,1334.399,1339.471,"Because of that reason, our kids don't see him very often.",101,,
265,0.97,1339.471,1344.443,We also don't have a family time at all.,101,,
266,0.97,1344.443,1351.883,All we ask today is a fair pay just to keep up with the price inflation.,101,,
267,0.97,1351.883,1352.451,Thank you very much.,101,,
268,0.97,1352.451,1354.92,Thank you for calling in today.,102,,

273,0.97,1378.21,1388.62,"Personally, I'm a friendly person, I don't get the time to spend with my family because we have long work hours with little pay.",103,,
274,0.97,1388.62,1397.195,"For many drivers, we have been fighting together with driver Union on behalf of thousands of drivers.",103,,
275,0.97,1397.195,1406.371,The need for fair pay that addresses racial equity is more important now than ever.,103,,
276,0.97,1406.371,1419.851,"For immigrant drivers who are front line during the pandemic time, the majority of them are Fll-Time drivers and their issue is one--fair pay.",103,,
277,0.97,1419.851,1422.454,No one earns less minimum after expenses.,103,,
278,0.97,1422.454,1423.622,"Thank you so much, Councilmembers.",103,,
279,0.97,1423.622,1427.058,Thank you for calling in today.,104,,

283,0.97,1445.777,1450.916,The 119835 regarding the proposed landmark language.,105,,
284,0.97,1450.916,1473.038,"This is supposed to shift authority from the landmarks board to Stci, the proposed language would affect only the landmark property as a former landmarks board member who voted for the Landmarking of this distinctive property, I object to any Nonlandmark staff or board oversight of this property.",105,,
285,0.97,1473.038,1481.046,"Sneaking a code change in through an omnibus bill is not the way to manage any landmark property, be it is is a building or site.",105,,
286,0.97,1481.046,1485.65,It's a disservice to do that to the landmark staff and the board.,105,,
287,0.97,1485.65,1497.329,I urge you to support Councilmember Pedersen's amendment and stop this action of 119835 proposed landmarks language.,105,,
288,0.97,1497.329,1501.8,"Second, please support Council bill 119858 West Seattle bridge financing.",105,,

294,0.97,1522.821,1529.528,And I'd like to talk about the fair pay.,107,,
295,0.97,1529.528,1530.362,We need fair pay.,107,,
296,0.97,1530.362,1540.005,We're--prices are--the fares are going down and down all the time more and more.,107,,
297,0.97,1540.005,1545.777,"In--let's see, it was 2014 I started driving for Uber.",107,,
298,0.97,1545.777,1553.919,And they were pretty fair rates then.,107,,
299,0.97,1553.919,1557.589,The base pay fare was $2.50.,107,,
300,0.97,1557.589,1559.557,The minimum fare was $6.,107,,
301,0.97,1559.557,1560.425,Cancellation was $5.,107,,
302,0.97,1560.425,1569.634,"And it's been going down and down every year, sometimes twice a year in the time I've been driving.",107,,
303,0.97,1569.634,1577.876,And it's getting harder to keep up with expenses when things like this are happening.,107,,
304,0.97,1577.876,1584.783,And we sure do need that fair pay increase for our work.,107,,
305,0.97,1584.783,1599.631,"We work long hours and sometimes it isn't real comfortable work, but a little bit of an increase, fair pay, would sure help us out a lot, and I hope everything goes in our favor.",107,,
306,0.97,1599.631,1612.644,"These rates that I just read to you were from 2014 when I first started driving, and now it's just awful what we get paid now.",107,,
307,0.97,1612.644,1621.186,We have to work many long hours in order to make--to make a halfway decent living.,107,,

321,0.97,1689.054,1693.391,You used to bring me present and you make the magic.,109,,
322,0.97,1693.391,1695.427,I can't do it anymore.,109,,
323,0.97,1695.427,1702.534,"And I'm standing sometimes one hour, two hours before getting home and find her wait, you know?",109,,
324,0.97,1702.534,1703.735,It's so bad really.,109,,
325,0.97,1703.735,1711.543,"I'm not going to talk about any numbers, about anything that you call for, but I'm going to talk as a human being.",109,,

356,0.97,1902.4,1913.745,"I am very optimistic, more than any other time, to see what the drivers Union being brought in front of the Council.",113,,
357,0.97,1913.745,1929.56,"We think this would be a modest improvement towards fair pay, and it would help the drivers keep up with the, you know, living increases in Seattle.",113,,
358,0.97,1929.56,1953.785,"Now, as a father with three school age children who especially with what we're going through, spending half the day tending to their educational needs, this would help me work less times and be there for their educational needs.",113,,

366,0.97,1987.618,2002.667,"I think in order to accommodate both the need for us to get through our Council business and the need to hear from additional folks, I'd ask that the it folks reduce the time allotted to one minute.",114,,

372,0.97,2037.101,2057.255,"As a lot of times people are hearing that drivers are weekend warriors and we go out for a couple hours, take a couple of drives, and while there are a couple of people who do that, at least a third of the drivers on the road are full-time drivers who are doing this as a primary way to feed their family.",115,,
373,0.97,2057.255,2062.794,"These full-time drivers, while we're only one-third of the total, we're taking more than 60% of the trips.",115,,
374,0.97,2062.794,2072.503,So we're pulling far more than our weight and are the most essential part of this system.,115,,
375,0.97,2072.503,2076.34,"Without us, this whole thing Crumbles and nobody can do what they need to do.",115,,
376,0.97,2076.34,2093.724,"It's important we make sure that drivers are respected and are continue to paid what we used to be paid, which was sustainable, and now it's not.",115,,
377,0.97,2093.724,2094.025,Thank you.,115,,
378,0.97,2094.025,2098.429,Thank you for calling in today.,116,,

382,0.97,2117.248,2119.617,"Okay, it works.",118,,
383,0.97,2119.617,2120.418,"Good afternoon, council.",118,,
384,0.97,2120.418,2129.76,"I was recently speaking to an Auckland city council who said due to climate change the city is not doing Scooters now, they're doing it wrong.",118,,
385,0.97,2129.76,2137.668,We hope you'll take his advice and approve a Scooter launch after years of preparation.,118,,
386,0.97,2137.668,2142.607,"Any delay means launching them when it's Rainier, darker and less safe to take a ride.",118,,
387,0.97,2142.607,2148.279,We have the longest experience in the country with Free-Floating Bikeshare.,118,,
388,0.97,2148.279,2152.717,It will be far from a loan.,118,,
389,0.97,2152.717,2159.79,Fewer cars means fewer Co2 intermissions and fewer children contracting asthma in polluted areas.,118,,
390,0.97,2159.79,2167.632,It means people can ride a Scooter for less than a subsidized bus trip.,118,,
391,0.97,2167.632,2172.737,"It'll strengthen the Bikeshare system, it enables us to expand from 500 bikes to 2,000.",118,,
392,0.97,2172.737,2178.009,This is why tons of local organizations are supporting this and have sent letters to the Council.,118,,
393,0.97,2178.009,2183.281,We support and hope you'll support it as well without any delay.,118,,
394,0.97,2183.281,2183.714,Thank you.,118,,

399,0.97,2203.868,2210.641,We support moving forward with a Scooter program.,120,,
400,0.97,2210.641,2213.044,Transit trips are inherently Multimodal.,120,,
401,0.97,2213.044,2219.15,Scooters will be a useful option to get to and from transit quickly and efficiently.,120,,
402,0.97,2219.15,2224.222,We support a low-income fare requirement to ensure discounts so cost is not a barrier.,120,,
403,0.97,2224.222,2235.032,"We have concerns about Scooters and bikes left in the Right-Of-Way, especially their impact on wheelchair users and people with mobility problems.",120,,
404,0.97,2235.032,2239.503,We urge you to ensure proper parking and ensure people with disabilities are protected.,120,,
405,0.97,2239.503,2244.008,There needs to be far more bike and Scooter parking throughout the city.,120,,

411,0.97,2262.56,2269.367,I'm a member of drivers Union and I'll be speaking in support of fair pay for drivers.,122,,
412,0.97,2269.367,2276.173,There are a few expenses which we incur and few people talk about them.,122,,
413,0.97,2276.173,2277.942,One of them is double insurance.,122,,
414,0.97,2277.942,2286.784,"Before Uber and Lyft can let us drive, get on the road, we have to show them we have insured the vehicles.",122,,
415,0.97,2286.784,2294.792,"Then after giving that, they take a cut from every ride which they say is paying for insurance.",122,,
416,0.97,2294.792,2298.896,"So if you can help us take care of that problem, we will be very happy.",122,,
417,0.97,2298.896,2304.435,The other thing I'd like to bring to your attention is that we don't have Healthcare.,122,,
418,0.97,2304.435,2309.44,We have to pay for it.,122,,
419,0.97,2309.44,2313.044,And we don't have any payment benefits.,122,,
420,0.97,2313.044,2319.35,And we find it even harder to get anything.,122,,
421,0.97,2319.35,2322.586,"Thank you, Francis, for calling in.",123,,
422,0.97,2322.586,2326.357,Next is Judith followed by Maria.,123,,

424,0.97,2326.957,2343.574,"Good afternoon, Councilmembers, I'm Judith, and I'm urging you support Councilmember Pedersen's amendment of CB 119835, the omnibus bill, because that bill should not be having substantive legislation in it.",124,,
425,0.97,2343.574,2359.356,"And that's what's happened here with respect to sites that will under the rubric of Sdci, these are historic sites as opposed to the landmarks board, which is where it belongs.",124,,
426,0.97,2359.356,2379.043,I've sent you a very long letter explaining why I think it's totally inappropriate among those that appeared to be tailored for the benefit of the hotel which has repeatedly flouted and failed to follow the rules involving this landmark site.,124,,
427,0.97,2379.043,2383.18,"But as historic Seattle has said, this may have greater implications.",124,,
428,0.97,2383.18,2386.751,Thank you very much and support the amendment Pedersen has drafted.,124,,
429,0.97,2386.751,2387.385,Thank you.,124,,

433,0.97,2401.332,2402.633,Good afternoon.,126,,
434,0.97,2402.633,2405.336,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez and Councilmembers.",126,,
435,0.97,2405.336,2421.552,"We at the beacon Hill Council ask you reject or amend Council bill 119853, page 39, line 6 to 20 on the basis of race and social justice equity.",126,,
436,0.97,2421.552,2425.89,It will prevent the development of a site without approval of the landmarks board.,126,,
437,0.97,2425.89,2433.063,We have 47 sites as meeting the criteria for Landmarking the city resources survey.,126,,
438,0.97,2433.063,2439.036,We asked the Department of neighborhoods to look for resources to have it Landmarked.,126,,
439,0.97,2439.036,2443.841,"They informed us the historic assessment resolution is nonbinding, which leaves us up a Creek.",126,,
440,0.97,2443.841,2450.181,"It gives no consideration to landmark sites, much less beacon Hill's historic sites.",126,,
441,0.97,2450.181,2454.819,We'd lose the diverse sites and we view that as a discriminatory act.,126,,
442,0.97,2454.819,2456.654,Please reject the amendment or amend it.,126,,
443,0.97,2456.654,2457.188,Thank you.,126,,

447,0.97,2477.775,2485.916,In recent months we've seen the abject failure of all three of Seattle's police accountability bodies.,128,,
448,0.97,2485.916,2495.326,"The community police Commission, Oig and SpA have ignored the murder on an African-American man, Terry, murdered in Seattle just days before George Floyd.",128,,
449,0.97,2495.326,2512.409,"Only recently has the OPA opened an investigation into this murder, claiming at first that no one submitted a complaint, despite the fact I had in June and despite the OPA having the mandate to do so independent of complaints.",128,,
450,0.97,2512.409,2520.784,The CPC abruptly and arbitrarily suspended public comment and fled into an illegal executive session to deal with this violation.,128,,
451,0.97,2520.784,2532.563,Here the bottom line is there's an urgent need not to just Defund and Reimagine policing but to Defund and Reimagine the current failed police accountability system.,128,,
452,0.97,2532.563,2532.863,Thank you.,128,,
453,0.97,2532.863,2533.197,Thank you.,129,,

462,0.97,2585.182,2600.331,I'm addressing the only us in bill 119835 in support of Councilmember Pedersen's amendment to strike the language that inserts the word short sites into section 17.,130,,
463,0.97,2600.331,2611.008,It would allow the director to authorize a use not currently permitted in the zone as an administrative conditional use within a structure.,130,,

465,0.97,2621.452,2638.435,So I encourage you to reject the language that's in there by supporting Councilmember Pedersen's amendment and the DCI already has a decision making power after the landmark board SEES it and decides.,130,,
466,0.97,2638.435,2642.172,Thank you for calling in today.,131,,
467,0.97,2642.172,2649.98,Next up is Eric followed by Bui.,131,,

757,0.97,4163.959,4173.502,"And as I think back on my nearly five years as deal's director, I am so compelled to practice this concept.",251,,
758,0.97,4173.502,4181.777,"That just in addition to experiences that I draw on as a father or a community member, you know, a black male educator.",251,,
759,0.97,4181.777,4207.236,"You know, I've continued to grow and learn during my time as deal director, and you know, I'm just taught lessons daily from the community, from our educators and school administrators, from our youth, from our deal staff and mainly from our--I shouldn't say mainly, but also from our many partners in city government, Philanthropy and business.",251,,
760,0.97,4207.236,4209.071,I just thank you all for this opportunity.,251,,
761,0.97,4209.071,4217.446,"And you know, in my time with deal, we've done a lot of critical work of community engagement, right?",251,,
762,0.97,4217.446,4228.824,"Like listening to families, or should I say listening to the voices of families, partners and educators and those with deep experience in supporting young people.",251,,
763,0.97,4228.824,4239.368,"And as you've mentioned, you know, the engagement really informed our work to development the Fep levy.",251,,
764,0.97,4239.368,4246.008,But it helped us as well to develop programs such as like Seattle preschool program or the promise.,251,,
765,0.97,4246.008,4263.092,"And as I--as a Department, we invest roughly about $100 million annually through Fep, through the sweet and beverage tax, through general Fund, some other grant revenues, but it's all to benefit our children, youth and families.",251,,
766,0.97,4263.092,4277.673,"And I know you all are aware of it, but we've conducted what numerous funding processes, right, that including the $100 in Fep, school and Community-Based investments that was really announced a few weeks ago.",251,,
767,0.97,4277.673,4281.11,And I'm just so proud to continue to serve in this role.,251,,
768,0.97,4281.11,4297.326,"You know, under my leadership and through the hard work, as you all mentioned, of deal's staff and partnership with our amazing community partners and Community-Based organizations, Seattle public schools, Seattle colleges.",251,,
769,0.97,4297.326,4326.588,"Deal really has provided many important services to the community, and you know, this year in response to the Covid pandemic we were able to launch the emergency child care program and, you know, it meant the needs, or should I say it met the Childcare needs of our essential workers and including the first responders and other workers, Healthcare and food industries, but through it all, you know, deal, our work is singular focus.",251,,
770,0.97,4326.588,4338.901,"Council President, you just mentioned it, and that's to partner with families and communities to achieve educational equity and close opportunity gaps to build a better economic future for our Seattle students.",251,,
771,0.97,4338.901,4353.615,"And I want to say as we move forward in this work to eliminate Race-Based opportunity gaps, I am going to continue to be informed by the wisdom, by this history of service and by the voices of community.",251,,
772,0.97,4353.615,4362.691,"And of course, Indied, much of the focus of our work moving forward comes directly from community, right?",251,,
773,0.97,4362.691,4382.411,"But the need for greater access to affordable child care, the need for more Multilingual diverse educators in our schools, and most recently, the need to expand reliable Wi-Fi access to our students.",251,,
774,0.97,4382.411,4418.046,"So I'm resolved or determined to help bring alignment to our city's educational investments, from Childcare, infant, toddler, School-Aged kids, preschool, K through 12 or after graduation, Post-Secondary and beyond so that at no point along that journey that I just mentioned our young children are left without access to a caring adult or some type of competent or culturally relevant educators and the critical, basically, resources and opportunities that is needed for their success.",251,,
775,0.97,4418.046,4426.655,"So as a black father of four beautiful black children, right, and I think frequently about the world and like my children growing up in this world.",251,,
776,0.97,4426.655,4430.092,And I just think about like the current events.,251,,
777,0.97,4430.092,4442.171,"And you know the recent demonstrations, community demonstrations, that have strengthened my belief in education is really the key driver that's going to have a positive social change in justice.",251,,
778,0.97,4442.171,4448.377,So I'm proud and this is why I'm grateful to be a part of this work.,251,,
779,0.97,4448.377,4463.559,"Because, as I just mentioned, the city's investments, the city and deal's investments, are making a difference in our young people's lives, both within the larger educational Ecosystem, but also, as you mentioned, on a school by school basis.",251,,
780,0.97,4463.559,4472.501,"So you know, recently I read something by John that said education is not like a preparation for life, it is, you know, education is life itself.",251,,
781,0.97,4472.501,4488.083,"And I know as we all link our arms together and take our cues from our young folks and listen to our young people and continue to focus on eliminating Úopportunity gaps, that's going to be key to this.",251,,
782,0.97,4488.083,4501.663,"So I'll say this in closing, I definitely want to thank Mayor Durkan for her continued support of me as a member of her cabinet and also to you, the city Council, for your continued partnership.",251,,
783,0.97,4501.663,4512.407,"And as you mentioned, Council President Gonzalez, all the questions you asked that make us sharper, you know, we appreciate it.",251,,

786,0.97,4525.587,4533.428,My Rainier Beach community and the community members and parents and aunts and uncles and everyone that stop and chat with me at the grocery store.,251,,
787,0.97,4533.428,4537.032,"Or if my kids tell it, people I stop and talk to.",251,,
788,0.97,4537.032,4542.571,"But most importantly, my wife, my children and my family members.",251,,
789,0.97,4542.571,4565.994,"So you know, as the proud director of the Department of education and early learning, you've got my pledge to demonstrate everything I've said through my words, through deeds, that this city, Seattle, that this city believes in, that we invest in and is committed to cultivating the brilliance and excellence of our children and youth.",251,,

1016,0.97,5476.804,5497.592,"Report of the land use and neighborhoods committee agenda item 17, council bill 119835, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning; correcting Typographical errors, correcting section references, clarifying regulations, and making minor amendments.",379,,
1017,0.97,5497.592,5501.162,The committee recommends the Council pass the bill as amended.,379,,
1018,0.97,5501.162,5501.729,Thank you.,379,,

1024,0.97,5515.076,5517.011,"Thank you, Council President.",381,,
1025,0.97,5517.011,5524.318,"This is the land use omnibus bill, considered roughly once a year and makes technical and clarifying amendments to our land use code.",381,,
1026,0.97,5524.318,5536.397,"The land use and neighborhoods committee made several amendments to this legislation, including removing confusing language regarding unit lot subdivisions in response to resident communication.",381,,
1027,0.97,5536.397,5549.877,We made a change that will make it easier to include decks and Patios on attached dwelling units and a compromise amendment regarding long-term bike parking requirements for affordable housing and senior living facilities.,381,,
1028,0.97,5549.877,5559.587,"There is a substitute amendment to consider today before we consider the base legislation, and that substitute makes several technical corrections and Clarifications.",381,,
1029,0.97,5559.587,5578.773,The substitute also makes minor changes to the bike parking requirements to clarify the allowance for up to five steps to access bike parking only as applied to exterior stairs and to allow a waiver from that step maximum from townhouses and Rowhouses on Sloped sites.,381,,
1030,0.97,5578.773,5588.149,I think there might be more work to do here and understand that it's important to move forward today.,381,,
1031,0.97,5588.149,5591.752,"I can address, though, Councilmember Pedersen's landmark amendment as it comes up.",381,,

1036,0.97,5615.977,5622.316,I will move proposed substitute to Council bill 119835.,383,,

1038,0.97,5632.66,5633.761,Is there a second?,384,,
1039,0.97,5633.761,5634.095,Second.,385,,
1040,0.97,5634.095,5634.895,Thank you so much.,386,,

1043,0.97,5644.905,5647.174,Is there anything else you'd like to add?,386,,
1044,0.97,5647.174,5652.847,Not at this time other than it made some technical and clarifying changes.,387,,
1045,0.97,5652.847,5653.881,All technical in nature.,387,,

1050,0.97,5669.397,5669.597,Okay.,389,,
1051,0.97,5669.597,5669.797,No.,390,,

1058,0.97,5705.633,5705.9,Juarez?,393,,
1059,0.97,5705.9,5709.203,Aye.,394,,

1061,0.97,5709.537,5709.97,Yes.,396,,

1071,0.97,5722.416,5722.75,Yes.,406,,
1072,0.97,5722.75,5723.684,Council President Gonzalez?,407,,
1073,0.97,5723.684,5724.318,Aye.,408,,
1074,0.97,5724.318,5726.554,"Nine in favor, none opposed.",409,,
1075,0.97,5726.554,5727.455,The motion carries.,410,,
1076,0.97,5727.455,5733.327,The amendment is adopted and the substituted bill is before the Council.,410,,
1077,0.97,5733.327,5747.641,"Councilmember Pedersen, I understand that you have an amendment, so I am going to hand it over to you to formally introduce the amendment and then we will open it up to discussion.",410,,
1078,0.97,5747.641,5756.383,"Thank you, Council president and thank you, chair Straus, for shepherding this bill forward.",411,,
1079,0.97,5756.383,5768.496,I introduced an amendment to cancel the request from the Seattle Department of construction and inspection to take the authority from the landmarks board regarding landmark sites.,411,,
1080,0.97,5768.496,5781.609,"That amendment tied in a vote of 2-2 in the land use committee and was therefore not incorporated in the version of the bill that advanced, and we just talked about the substitute.",411,,
1081,0.97,5781.609,5792.82,"Since the time of our committee vote, we confirmed that the landmarks board has not officially weighed in on this move to take authority from them.",411,,
1082,0.97,5792.82,5805.533,"In addition, historic Seattle opposes that change to strike the word sites from the bill or to--right, to add the word sites to the bill.",411,,
1083,0.97,5805.533,5819.847,So this amendment that I have Recirculated this morning gives Councilmembers a chance to consider this amendment if they weren't on the land use committee and those who might have been okay with it previously to reconsider it.,411,,
1084,0.97,5819.847,5825.986,This memo is Crafted by central staff and approved by the law Department.,411,,
1085,0.97,5825.986,5847.608,And so I'd like to move to amend Council bill 119835 as presented on the amendment amending section 17 of the bill which was distributed earlier basically striking the word sites so that the authority for sites would still stay with the landmarks board.,411,,
1086,0.97,5847.608,5853.38,And it's something that Sdci can come back with later if they want to.,411,,
1087,0.97,5853.38,5855.082,Is there a second?,412,,
1088,0.97,5855.082,5858.152,"Was that you, Councilmember Herbold?",412,,
1089,0.97,5858.152,5858.485,It was.,413,,
1090,0.97,5858.485,5858.986,Okay.,414,,
1091,0.97,5858.986,5859.186,Sorry.,414,,
1092,0.97,5859.186,5861.755,"We accidentally spoke over each other, so I appreciate it.",414,,
1093,0.97,5861.755,5872.6,It's been moved and Seconded to amend Council bill 119835 as presented on the amendment.,414,,
1094,0.97,5872.6,5876.871,Are there any additional comments on the amendment?,414,,
1095,0.97,5876.871,5879.273,Councilmember Strauss followed by Councilmember Herbold.,414,,
1096,0.97,5879.273,5886.046,"Thank you, Council President, Úand thank you, Councilmember Pedersen for your robust work on this amendment.",415,,
1097,0.97,5886.046,5892.519,I will be voting no on this amendment as I did previously in committee.,415,,
1098,0.97,5892.519,5903.397,And my office has spoken with our central staff and staff from Department of neighborhoods historic Department.,415,,
1099,0.97,5903.397,5909.436,They seemed to be describing change that is are not proposed in this bill.,415,,
1100,0.97,5909.436,5913.741,And I understand that confusion in this manner is not helpful.,415,,
1101,0.97,5913.741,5917.678,So everything is working quickly and we're trying to work together.,415,,
1102,0.97,5917.678,5922.316,So that's why I really commend Councilmember Pedersen for continuing to work on this.,415,,
1103,0.97,5922.316,5933.761,The proposal that this amendment seeks to remove is simply a technical correction that would not have a wide ranging impact that has been thought.,415,,
1104,0.97,5933.761,5942.97,Specifically these changes would not remove or weaken any authority in the Department of neighborhoods or landmarks preservation currently has.,415,,
1105,0.97,5942.97,5949.543,"The landmarks board currently does not have jurisdiction over use, and so that is how the building is used.",415,,
1106,0.97,5949.543,5954.448,That already belongs with the Seattle Department of construction and Inspoexs.,415,,
1107,0.97,5954.448,5964.491,The landmarks board would continue to have authority over any physical change to the designated features of a landmark structure or site.,415,,
1108,0.97,5964.491,5968.762,That does not change with this amendment.,415,,
1109,0.97,5968.762,5976.97,Seattle Department of construction and inspections already has the authority to grant Nonconforming uses.,415,,
1110,0.97,5976.97,5986.747,So they already have the authority to grant Nonconforming use to landmark structures if they meet the criteria.,415,,
1111,0.97,5986.747,6000.828,The uses that are allowed within the zone are impractical to provide in the landmark structure or do not provide inadequate financial support to maintain the landmark.,415,,
1112,0.97,6000.828,6007.201,And that the use is not detrimental to the surrounding uses or public interest.,415,,
1113,0.97,6007.201,6013.107,So they have to already be allowed in this area.,415,,
1114,0.97,6013.107,6022.383,This change would not change the existing authority other than to clarify that it applies to the landmark site as well as the structure.,415,,
1115,0.97,6022.383,6037.364,"So the reason that the site--we're focussing on this word site versus structure is because the existing authority already exists within the building, and so now we're talking about what is occurring outside of the building on the same property.",415,,
1116,0.97,6037.364,6052.713,The exclusion of sites from the code seems to have been a previous oversight rather than a code choice.,415,,
1117,0.97,6052.713,6059.386,I think that we could and should have that policy conversation if warranted.,415,,
1118,0.97,6059.386,6067.861,The current distinction between sites and structures leads to weird constraints in these land use decisions.,415,,
1119,0.97,6067.861,6075.102,"For example, Sdci could approve a Childcare center inside a landmark structure as a Nonconforming use.",415,,
1120,0.97,6075.102,6088.182,"However, if that structure has a park lot or an outdoor area, Sdci could not approve using that parking or outdoor space to support the Childcare facility because it's part of the site rather than the structure.",415,,
1121,0.97,6088.182,6097.925,"So to kind of sum all of these changes up, there's no changes to how the landmarks board authority operates.",415,,
1122,0.97,6097.925,6107.835,"They'll have authority over physical changes to designated features, just an addition of sites to Sdci's existing authority.",415,,
1123,0.97,6107.835,6115.375,"Sdci first consulted with the historic preservation staff last year, but that does not mean that more robust conversation needs to occur.",415,,
1124,0.97,6115.375,6124.618,"So Unfortunately, it sounds like we have crossed wires in working remotely as virtual meetings can be difficult.",415,,
1125,0.97,6124.618,6129.056,And I hope that my comments clarify the proposal.,415,,
1126,0.97,6129.056,6134.895,"This is not something that I'm going to, you know, fall on my sword about.",415,,
1127,0.97,6134.895,6143.937,I think that there are important conversations to have about how we use the sites of our historically designated buildings.,415,,
1128,0.97,6143.937,6157.05,"I just wanted to clarify that the--what we're discussing about the site, the parking lot, the space around the buildings is already within the code for the building.",415,,
1129,0.97,6157.05,6160.454,And it impacts only use and not a structure.,415,,
1130,0.97,6160.454,6173.867,"And so again, I really want to thank Councilmember Pedersen for bringing this forward, continuing this conversation and thank you, colleagues for your time.",415,,
1131,0.97,6173.867,6176.27,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",416,,
1132,0.97,6176.27,6176.937,Councilmember Herbold?,416,,
1133,0.97,6176.937,6177.871,Let's see here.,417,,
1134,0.97,6177.871,6179.006,"Okay, thank you.",417,,
1135,0.97,6179.006,6191.084,So I think really for me this hedges on this question of whether or not this is a technical amendment or not.,417,,
1136,0.97,6191.084,6206.133,"And you know, we have a longstanding practice of how we handle legislation that is part of the omnibus bill coming out of Sdci for the land use code.",417,,
1137,0.97,6206.133,6215.909,"And to my knowledge, the understanding is that because it's a very large bill it covers dozens of different code sections.",417,,
1138,0.97,6215.909,6221.748,"In this case, this bill is 121 pages long.",417,,
1139,0.97,6221.748,6249.876,"We have an agreement that we handle only technical amendments in the omnibus bill, and that we have an agreement and a commitment from the executive that bill that is are--that have impacts on policy and that respect technical in nature are bills that we hear separately because of a heightened interest on behalf of the public and because of the existence of Stakeholders.",417,,
1140,0.97,6249.876,6271.398,"In this case, Stakeholders that we have chartered to give us advice on properties such as the incentive program that zoning code relief for historic sites.",417,,
1141,0.97,6271.398,6277.237,And so I don't believe this change is technical in nature.,417,,
1142,0.97,6277.237,6288.081,"One of the things that woo said is adding the word with--I'm sorry, with historic Seattle adding the word site or sites might seem like a minor thing.",417,,
1143,0.97,6288.081,6289.116,It is not.,417,,
1144,0.97,6289.116,6293.353,One word can have a lot of meaning.,417,,
1145,0.97,6293.353,6299.259,The proposed addition of site or sites is not a correction of a Typographical error.,417,,
1146,0.97,6299.259,6301.595,It does not correct section references.,417,,
1147,0.97,6301.595,6308.635,It does not clarify a regulation and it is not a minor amendment.,417,,
1148,0.97,6308.635,6329.156,"Again, this is not a distinction or discussion on whether or not this is a good amendment or a bad amendment, merely that we have an agreement and a commitment with Stakehlders, with ourselves, with the executive with the types of change that is we will consider in omnibus legislation.",417,,
1149,0.97,6329.156,6345.906,"And just wanting to also quote Deb Barker, who's a former landmarks board member when she said to basically shift authority from these sites from our landmarks board to the executive through this bill.",417,,
1150,0.97,6345.906,6353.747,She says it's a disservice to the hard work that the landmark staff and the volunteer landmarks board perform.,417,,
1151,0.97,6353.747,6380.707,And I really think that landmarks preservation board input would be invaluable in a discussion around what may be useful and appropriate zoning code relief as an incentive to provide more flexibility for existing landmarks whether or not they are properties or sites.,417,,
1152,0.97,6380.707,6381.575,So thank you.,417,,
1153,0.97,6381.575,6383.11,Any other comments?,418,,
1154,0.97,6383.11,6387.748,"I see Councilmember Lewis then Councilmember Mosqueda, then Councilmember Morales.",418,,
1155,0.97,6387.748,6390.851,"Thank you so much, Madame President.",419,,
1156,0.97,6390.851,6408.702,So I agree with everything that Councilmember Herbold just said in terms of really Cueing up the posture of where this lands for me in terms of the context of what the change is and how it's packaged into the omnibus legislation.,419,,
1157,0.97,6408.702,6435.429,"And I do want to hear, especially as someone who, like many of us, formerly served on a city board or Commission from the landmark board, on the Ipact of this change especially given woo's Email from historic Seattle earlier really underscoring that historic Seattle does have some concerns with this legislation.",419,,
1158,0.97,6435.429,6442.636,"And really, for me, I was one of the Councilmembers in the committee that did vote for this amendment before.",419,,
1159,0.97,6442.636,6447.974,I was certainly open to potentially changing my vote in the committee today.,419,,
1160,0.97,6447.974,6462.889,"I do think the Email from historic Seattle was really Impactful given that they are a very critical Stakeholder on our mission of historic preservation, especially as relates to the critical work they've done around place making.",419,,
1161,0.97,6462.889,6481.374,Washington hall and the good Shepherds center and a lot of the organizations they've put a lot of investment in gives me a lot of respect for what they do or do don't think is important in this world of historic preservation in Seattle.,419,,
1162,0.97,6481.374,6497.958,"I would like to work with them more, as they said, not necessarily to oppose this change forever but to Cue up a more Deliberative process to discuss some of the implications around the potential change of the site and site's language that could have bigger implications.",419,,
1163,0.97,6497.958,6505.732,"So for those reasons, I am going to vote for this amendment again today.",419,,
1164,0.97,6505.732,6509.603,And appreciate Councilmember Pedersen bringing it forward again.,419,,
1165,0.97,6509.603,6516.977,I think Councilmember Mosqueda was next and then Councilmember Morales.,420,,
1166,0.97,6516.977,6521.114,"Thank you very much, Council President.",421,,
1167,0.97,6521.114,6532.158,"I want to underscore the comments that Council member Strauss made today, and as chair of the committee, what he has brought to light in the last few conversations that we've had.",421,,
1168,0.97,6532.158,6540.7,"So to add to the conversation that we had this morning, I want to reiterate this omnibus change only applies to single family zone.",421,,
1169,0.97,6540.7,6547.507,"So this will not apply to, for example, the beacon Hill garden house which was mentioned earlier today from our friends in beacon Hill.",421,,
1170,0.97,6547.507,6549.576,This is not within the single family zone.,421,,
1171,0.97,6549.576,6554.347,So that is not going to be affected.,421,,
1172,0.97,6554.347,6557.25,"Further more, Nonconforming uses may be approved on landmark buildings already.",421,,
1173,0.97,6557.25,6558.351,This is already a practice.,421,,
1174,0.97,6558.351,6561.755,So this is a technical change in nature.,421,,
1175,0.97,6561.755,6575.835,The omnibus change would extend this to include sites and approving Nonconforming uses through the administrative conditional use process is the jurisdiction of Sdci after consulting with the Department of neighborhoods.,421,,
1176,0.97,6575.835,6578.672,The landmarks preservation board does not have jurisdiction over this use.,421,,
1177,0.97,6578.672,6585.545,"I want to say that one more time, because I think there has been confusion out there.",421,,
1178,0.97,6585.545,6588.415,The landmarks preservation board does not have jurisdiction over this use.,421,,
1179,0.97,6588.415,6593.186,This is not shifting any role that they currently have.,421,,
1180,0.97,6593.186,6609.536,"Additionally, any physical change to the designated features of a landmark building or site is the jurisdiction of the landmarks preservation board and that authority is not changing within the omnibus code.",421,,
1181,0.97,6609.536,6617.51,"Councilmember Strauss said this already, and I'm lifting this up so it doesn't get lost in the discussion around this.",421,,
1182,0.97,6617.51,6619.279,Some of these topics can be contentious.,421,,
1183,0.97,6619.279,6628.154,We want to make sure that we're looking at opportunities for the best use of public spaces or other spaces to serve the public.,421,,
1184,0.97,6628.154,6635.562,"But this, again, this does not change the jurisdiction of the landmarks preservation board within this code.",421,,
1185,0.97,6635.562,6647.907,"This is a technical change, Department of neighborhoods and Sdci treat landmark buildings and sites the same and has authority over fiscal changes and over buildings.",421,,
1186,0.97,6647.907,6662.455,"And Sdci, again, I want to reiterate the--sorry, Nonconforming uses may be done already.",421,,
1187,0.97,6662.455,6670.397,"And approving Nonconforming use through the process is, again, the jurisdiction of Sdci after consultation with the Oo.",421,,
1188,0.97,6670.397,6671.398,I'll be supporting this.,421,,
1189,0.97,6671.398,6674.701,If that wasn't clear from my earlier comments and just now.,421,,
1190,0.97,6674.701,6680.54,Thank you very much.,421,,
1191,0.97,6680.54,6681.908,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",422,,
1192,0.97,6681.908,6682.375,Councilmember Morales?,422,,
1193,0.97,6682.375,6685.779,I'll be supporting the bill as is.,423,,
1194,0.97,6685.779,6697.057,"I'm sorry, Councilmember Pedersen, not supporting the amendment.",423,,
1195,0.97,6697.057,6697.457,Sorry about that.,423,,
1196,0.97,6697.457,6702.562,"Okay, so I, as I understand it, it's supposed to be technical in nature.",424,,
1197,0.97,6702.562,6721.748,And I will say that it does sound like it's getting sticky because there is a deeper policy issue being addressed and what seems like a minor word change leaves more questions about unintended consequences.,424,,
1198,0.97,6721.748,6730.39,We did have a conversation today with central staff who pointed out there are no pending applications who would be impacted by this change.,424,,
1199,0.97,6730.39,6741.434,"But it is also my understanding and maybe Councilmember Strauss can clarify this, there's one property that would benefit from this right now, from this kind of a change.",424,,
1200,0.97,6741.434,6772.999,"So I think for me the question is that clarity around what would be impacted by this beyond just one potential project and how that relates to, you know, if there's a policy change being made for one purpose or if there is a deeper or a broader implication here as we're trying to make the decision.",424,,
1201,0.97,6772.999,6777.237,"Councilmember Strauss, that question was addressed to you, so you're welcome to respond.",425,,
1202,0.97,6777.237,6777.637,Great.,426,,
1203,0.97,6777.637,6781.407,"Thank you so much, and thank you Councilmember Morales.",426,,
1204,0.97,6781.407,6808.601,"My understanding is, as I explained before, the deeper--the long-term benefits of this are that a building's use and the site's use could both be considered by the Seattle Department of construction and inspections rather than this situation which we have today which the use is only--the decisions can only be made within the building.",426,,
1205,0.97,6808.601,6816.743,"And I think that Childcare really is a great example because the State Department of children, youth and families requires both parking and outdoor space.",426,,
1206,0.97,6816.743,6829.422,And so when we're looking at it from that type of a technical change allowing a Department to make a decision based on an entire facility is important.,426,,
1207,0.97,6829.422,6851.511,"Now, when it comes to the one site that I've heard repeatedly also brought up, I don't--it's not my understanding that there's an application and maybe Councilmember Pedersen can enlighten us more about that site because it's not within my district and it's not something I've had my fingertips right on top of.",426,,
1208,0.97,6851.511,6860.186,So when--and I hear that there is a bit of confusion regarding whether this is a policy change or a technical change.,426,,
1209,0.97,6860.186,6863.69,And that's why I said earlier this is--it's not the end of the world.,426,,
1210,0.97,6863.69,6874.567,"It's not something I'm going to die on my sword for, because if there is a policy--if this is a policy implication that people need to have a conversation object, then that's fine.",426,,
1211,0.97,6874.567,6880.206,And that's something that we should do.,426,,
1212,0.97,6880.206,6895.488,"When we're looking at, especially historic buildings and single family zones, which comprise the majority of the city of Seattle, this could create cumbersome red tape that could be unnecessary in places.",426,,
1213,0.97,6895.488,6908.701,"Now, if we need to protect certain aspects of our historic sites and buildings then I think that's really important.",426,,
1214,0.97,6908.701,6920.38,"And that's why the landmark board's jurisdiction over this does not change, because the look and feel of the historic site will not be altered by this one word change.",426,,
1215,0.97,6920.38,6923.216,It is simply the use.,426,,
1216,0.97,6923.216,6939.365,"So Childcare facilities is why I keep going back to that example because Childcare facilities do require parking, Drive-Up, Load/Unload and outdoor use, whereas most other uses are able to be confined into the building.",426,,
1217,0.97,6939.365,6957.65,"I do believe that the site that has repeatedly come up has a restriction for educational uses, but I'm not going to--I'm not going to wade into those waters because I don't have enough information to discuss it appropriately.",426,,
1218,0.97,6957.65,6957.951,Thank you.,426,,
1219,0.97,6957.951,6958.685,"Hey, all right.",427,,
1220,0.97,6958.685,6967.126,"We're going to--it's your amendment, so you get the last word, Councilmember Pedersen.",427,,
1221,0.97,6967.126,6972.832,I'm going to just make a couple of brief remarks before you do that.,427,,
1222,0.97,6972.832,6978.471,"So my understanding of what we're voting on now is, in fact, an omnibus bill.",427,,
1223,0.97,6978.471,6988.815,It is designed to reflect technical corrections to the land use code as a cleanup effort.,427,,
1224,0.97,6988.815,6994.921,"And, frankly, I feel like we're making a mountain out of a mole Hill on this one.",427,,
1225,0.97,6994.921,7000.693,And I do think and believe that it is a technical correction.,427,,
1226,0.97,7000.693,7008.001,We have heard language both from Councilmember Strauss and Councilmember Mosqueda.,427,,
1227,0.97,7008.001,7018.878,And I have not heard any concrete citation to specific language that proves otherwise that Sdci already has the authority to make these Orts of decisions.,427,,
1228,0.97,7018.878,7038.164,"And if that is true, and I don't have a reason to believe it is not true, then this language is cleanup and simply designed to make sure that the decision making by Sdci is consistent as it relates to the site and use issues that Councilmember Strauss has highlighted.",427,,
1229,0.97,7038.164,7057.15,"So I intend to vote no on this amendment, and I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Pedersen to close out debate on this amendment so we can go ahead and call it to a vote and address the underlying bill accordingly.",427,,
1230,0.97,7057.15,7063.322,"So Councilmember Pedersen, sorry, no, we're going to close that debate.",427,,
1231,0.97,7063.322,7063.689,I'm sorry.,427,,
1232,0.97,7063.689,7064.323,"Councilmember Pedersen, please.",427,,
1233,0.97,7064.323,7064.657,Thank you.,428,,
1234,0.97,7064.657,7076.302,And want to thank everybody who did call in and who wrote to us with their concerns about this from the different communities across the city.,428,,
1235,0.97,7076.302,7093.686,"And you know, there--it's--whether it's about a use or not, because it talks about configuration of the site, which is more than just use, configuration of the site is what Sdci wants to put in there and have authority over.",428,,
1236,0.97,7093.686,7115.341,"Úand so it's precisely because f this confusion as to whether it is substantive or not that it, in my opinion, should be pulled ot, which is what this amendment would do, to enable Sdci, if they really feel this is necessary change, if they can just come back and we can daylight everything and have a full, robust discussion about it.",428,,
1237,0.97,7115.341,7122.715,"But it's just not appropriate in an omnibus bill, traditionally, to have what could be considered substantive change so.",428,,
1238,0.97,7122.715,7136.762,"I just asked my colleagues to consider approving this amendment and then we can discuss this at a later date about the use and configuration of various sites and open space, et cetera.",428,,
1239,0.97,7136.762,7137.263,Thank you.,428,,
1240,0.97,7137.263,7138.431,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",429,,
1241,0.97,7138.431,7146.038,"We're going to go ahead and close out debate because we've had a long conversation about this during Council briefing, and we're having a long conversation now.",429,,
1242,0.97,7146.038,7151.244,And there was a long conversation in the committee.,429,,
1243,0.97,7151.244,7157.316,"We are, I think, at the end of the road here and it's time for us to make a call one way or the other.",429,,
1244,0.97,7157.316,7172.999,So I'm going to ask that the clerk call the roll.,429,,
1245,0.97,7172.999,7173.332,Herbold?,430,,
1246,0.97,7173.332,7177.47,Yes.,431,,

1264,0.97,7201.827,7203.329,"Thank you so much, Madame clerk.",449,,
1265,0.97,7203.329,7206.999,The motion fails and the amendment is not adopted.,449,,
1266,0.97,7206.999,7214.073,Are there any further comments on the bill as amended?,449,,
1267,0.97,7214.073,7220.713,Councilmember Mosqueda and then Councilmember Strauss you'll have the last word since you're sponsor of the bill.,449,,
1268,0.97,7220.713,7221.213,Councilmember Mosqueda?,449,,
1269,0.97,7221.213,7222.048,"Thank you, Madame President.",450,,
1270,0.97,7222.048,7225.484,"Again, thanks to Councilmember Strauss for shepherding this omnibus bill through.",450,,
1271,0.97,7225.484,7239.565,I want to say thank you for the work that you did to include amendments technical in nature to make sure that we codify the intent of what we passed last year.,450,,
1272,0.97,7239.565,7254.513,This is going to go a long way to make sure that Unenclosed decks and rooftops over Patios can extend to make sure that there's more ability for people to enjoy their rooftop areas.,450,,
1273,0.97,7254.513,7262.588,"As we create greater density, we want a city that's livable and Walkable and accessible for all ages and abilities.",450,,
1274,0.97,7262.588,7265.791,We use our rooftop as ur backyard because we don't have a backyard.,450,,
1275,0.97,7265.791,7273.165,And this is where we have our dinners on our patio and our Kiddo plays and we visit with our Elders.,450,,
1276,0.97,7273.165,7282.008,"So looking forward to supporting this legislation for a number of reasons, but I want to thank you for working with our office to include that technical amendment to make sure we were clear on that effort.",450,,
1277,0.97,7282.008,7286.412,I hope that will go a long way for the livability of this city.,450,,
1278,0.97,7286.412,7286.712,Thank you.,450,,
1279,0.97,7286.712,7287.546,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",451,,
1280,0.97,7287.546,7292.518,Are there any other comments on the bill?,451,,
1281,0.97,7292.518,7293.853,"Okay, Councilmember Strauss, last word is yours.",451,,
1282,0.97,7293.853,7300.96,Just again want to thank Councilmember Pedersen for bringing this amendment forward and other amendments forward.,452,,
1283,0.97,7300.96,7307.199,Councilmember Herbold also spoke to the importance of omnibus bills making technical and not policy changes.,452,,
1284,0.97,7307.199,7314.974,And I know that in days of working virtually and remotely that it can be confusing what is technical and what is policy.,452,,
1285,0.97,7314.974,7317.543,And I appreciate everyone's willingness to work together.,452,,
1286,0.97,7317.543,7334.727,"Some of the other, as I said previously, some of the other confusing language that we removed was regarding watt unit subdivisions, which could be viewed as technical or it could be viewed as policy.",452,,
1287,0.97,7334.727,7338.564,Already discussed was the Patios and decks for Adus.,452,,
1288,0.97,7338.564,7345.304,Also I want to highlight there was a lot of work put into one amendment regarding long-term bike parking.,452,,
1289,0.97,7345.304,7350.409,And I know that there's--there could be some additional work to clean it up in the future.,452,,
1290,0.97,7350.409,7364.99,"Just that in this moment where we continue to hear how divisive everything is, this was a moment where people came together and really were able to compromise and find a solution that works as best as it can for everyone engaged.",452,,
1291,0.97,7364.99,7380.673,"And so I want to thank my colleagues on the land use and neighborhoods committee and thank everyone, all public Stakeholders and city departments who weighed in on this very long bill.",452,,
1292,0.97,7380.673,7384.477,"Thank you, Council President, I look forward to the passage of this bill.",452,,
1293,0.97,7384.477,7388.514,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss, for all your work on this particular bill.",453,,

1356,0.97,7613.305,7621.347,"Yes, Councilmember Strauss has done a lot of work on this, and so I'd like to turn it over to him if you would like.",500,,
1357,0.97,7621.347,7624.516,Otherwise I can address it as well.,500,,
1358,0.97,7624.516,7625.551,Y'all's call.,501,,
1359,0.97,7625.551,7625.918,All right.,502,,
1360,0.97,7625.918,7632.958,"I just wanted to thank you Councilmember Pedersen, chair of transportation and utilities committee.",502,,
1361,0.97,7632.958,7639.965,This bill was intended primarily to address sidewalk cafes and street cafes permitting.,502,,
1362,0.97,7639.965,7657.549,"I did hear during public comment some other concerns and I would have liked to be able to address those earlier on and, again, anyone who's engaged in land use please don't hesitate to reach out to our office.",502,,
1363,0.97,7657.549,7662.087,We look forward to working with all Stakeholders.,502,,
1364,0.97,7662.087,7667.559,"Councilmember Pedersen has done great work on this, and we work really well together.",502,,
1365,0.97,7667.559,7685.611,All that to say that sidewalk cafes and cafe streets are really going to be the way we create an economic--the ability for our economy to exist during Covid times because outdoor transmission is lower than indoor transmission.,502,,
1366,0.97,7685.611,7691.45,So the ability to use our public rights of way for economic activity is incredibly important.,502,,
1367,0.97,7691.45,7705.197,And this bill not only allows that but also allows that to be free of charge so that we are ensuring that our economy is able to restart as quickly as possible in an outdoor setting.,502,,
1368,0.97,7705.197,7726.885,"We've seen these sidewalk cafes and street cafes in Seattle together streets popping up across our city, and it's an amazing feature I think will have a lasting impact in a positive way in Seattle in how we eat, dine, shop and speak to one another whether it's in Covid or once we're out of this pandemic.",502,,
1369,0.97,7726.885,7731.957,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen, would you like to add anything on to that?",502,,

1375,0.97,7754.58,7761.153,"For the chair of transportation and for the prime sponsor of the bill, actually just a quick question if you don't mind.",505,,
1376,0.97,7761.153,7769.495,"To catch us up, I'm wondering if you can talk about the Timeline of some of these Street cafes and the permitting process.",505,,
1377,0.97,7769.495,7790.582,"I saw some comments Online about the short duration of some of the permitting and a desire to either see the duration extended, or in some cases, to make these locations permanent so that we can have some super block spots across our city as a possible positive outcome of this policy change.",505,,
1378,0.97,7790.582,7799.892,"Can you comment a little bit, if it's appropriate Madame President, just on the duration and possibility of extension or permanent nature?",505,,
1379,0.97,7799.892,7803.061,"Sure, Councilmember Pedersen, would you like to take that question?",506,,
1380,0.97,7803.061,7803.295,Yes.,507,,
1381,0.97,7803.295,7805.831,It is for just a few months.,507,,
1382,0.97,7805.831,7809.535,It is supposed to be about during Covid pandemic.,507,,
1383,0.97,7809.535,7824.516,"And first we need to collect the data on how it's going, what the impacts are to other businesses who might not be getting these permits who might want more parking nearby or bus routes, et cetera.",507,,
1384,0.97,7824.516,7837.529,"We're collecting--is DOT is going to be collecting data on this so we can determine what to do on a more permanent basis, if at all.",507,,
1385,0.97,7837.529,7838.197,Councilmember Strauss?,508,,
1386,0.97,7838.197,7841.066,"Yes, thank you, Council President.",509,,
1387,0.97,7841.066,7842.034,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",509,,
1388,0.97,7842.034,7854.079,I would say that these permits were set up as quickly as possible by Sdot working through the Covid pandemic.,509,,
1389,0.97,7854.079,7860.953,There was a short Timeline associated with them.,509,,
1390,0.97,7860.953,7866.491,"I think that with any pilot project, this one included, we'll see the benefits and also what doesn't work so well.",509,,
1391,0.97,7866.491,7879.238,"I am going to champion that we make these permanent features within our community because I think Street cafes and sidewalk cafes are--even before the pandemic, I was a large fan of these.",509,,
1392,0.97,7879.238,7893.919,"To your point, the super blocks where we're able to really create a Pedestrianized space that allows for deliveries, Operationings, people with all ages and abilities are able to access that space.",509,,
1393,0.97,7893.919,7897.189,"And you know, the Three-Minute To-Go orders as well.",509,,
1394,0.97,7897.189,7898.624,There's a real opportunity here.,509,,
1395,0.97,7898.624,7904.563,"I'm going to champion to make these permanent, I would hope my colleagues would join me in that.",509,,
1396,0.97,7904.563,7914.539,"And with that, I want to thank Sdot for working as quickly as possible to get this temporary permit available free of charge.",509,,
1397,0.97,7914.539,7916.041,Thank you both very much.,510,,
1398,0.97,7916.041,7921.413,Thank you so much.,511,,
1399,0.97,7921.413,7925.017,Are there any other comments by my colleagues?,511,,
1400,0.97,7925.017,7925.217,Okay.,511,,
1401,0.97,7925.217,7949.641,"I would just say that I did reach out to the Seattle Department of transportation related to some concerns that we received sort of in the 11th hour here about--and we heard a little bit about this in public comment--about the impact of this bill, street use fees, on construction of affordable homes.",511,,
1402,0.97,7949.641,7959.851,"And Unfortunately, my understanding is that Sdot did, in fact, do a presentation for the organization that reached out to us via letter and in public comment today.",511,,
1403,0.97,7959.851,7966.825,And that they received no concerns or feedback at that time.,511,,
1404,0.97,7966.825,7980.706,"Again, that doesn't mean that there weren't concerns, it just means that there was an opportunity and the opportunity was not taken at that time to provide any concerns.",511,,
1405,0.97,7980.706,7995.153,"And again, the Department of transportation believes that the intention of this proposal is to actually reduce the cost for Townhouse-Type development and that projects outside of urban centers should remain pretty even.",511,,
1406,0.97,7995.153,8004.463,The increases proposed in the street use fees will primarily be in the downtown core.,511,,
1407,0.97,8004.463,8031.823,"So direct the director and his team are happy to connect with any of us, colleagues, that continue to have concerns about this particular issue Sxichlt look forward to supporting the bill as it is introduced today with the understanding that, obviously, there could be--there will be more to come on this policy issue as flagged by Councilmember Strauss in terms of the potential long-term nature of this kind of a program.",511,,
1408,0.97,8031.823,8034.593,"So with that being said, let's go ahead and close out debate.",511,,
1409,0.97,8034.593,8045.771,I would ask the clerk call the roll on the passage of the bill.,511,,

1434,0.97,8085.777,8101.726,An Ordnancerelating to the Cityb code--amending sections 11.46.010 and 11.46.020 of the Seattle municipal code to revise permissible areas of operation in the Right-Of-Way and other public pathways for electric personal Assistive mobility devices and motorized foot Scooters.,532,,
1435,0.97,8101.726,8107.866,The committee recommends the bill pass.,532,,
1436,0.97,8107.866,8108.834,"Thank you, Madame clerk.",533,,

1439,0.97,8117.776,8127.319,"So items 20 and 22 on today's agenda, 20 is Council bill 119867.",534,,
1440,0.97,8127.319,8129.754,And 22 is 119868.,534,,
1441,0.97,8129.754,8131.857,Both deal with the Scooter program.,534,,
1442,0.97,8131.857,8136.261,"Councilmember Strauss, vice chair of the committee, is a sponsor on those two bills.",534,,
1443,0.97,8136.261,8145.27,"I would recommend we at least discuss those as a group, as a couple and then we can vote on it however you want.",534,,
1444,0.97,8145.27,8149.441,"But those two items go together, 20 and 22.",534,,
1445,0.97,8149.441,8149.674,Yeah.,535,,
1446,0.97,8149.674,8159.284,"Madame clerk, can you please read into the record item 22 so that we can have a conversation about both?",535,,
1447,0.97,8159.284,8165.79,But we will take up the bills separately and in the order listed on the agenda.,535,,
1448,0.97,8165.79,8184.609,"Agenda item 22, council bill 119868, an ordinance relating to use of city Right-Of-Way by Free-Floating Scooters--amending section 15.17.005 of the Seattle municipal code, adopting a Free-Floating Scooter share program fee schedule and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",536,,
1449,0.97,8184.609,8192.117,The committee recommends the bill pass.,536,,
1450,0.97,8192.117,8192.717,"Thank you, Madame clerk.",537,,
1451,0.97,8192.717,8201.293,"Okay, Councilmember Pedersen, back to you as chair of the committee to provide the committee report.",537,,
1452,0.97,8201.293,8205.697,"Yes, so the committee recommended adoption of both of these Council bills.",538,,
1453,0.97,8205.697,8219.177,"However, if Councilmember Strauss would like this, I'd like to turn it over to Councilmember Strauss who's the sponsor of the bills who could speak more eloquently in favor of them than, certainly, I could or would.",538,,
1454,0.97,8219.177,8222.013,"Councilmember Strauss, please?",539,,
1455,0.97,8222.013,8223.648,"Thank you, Council President.",540,,
1456,0.97,8223.648,8224.816,"Thank you, chair Pedersen.",540,,
1457,0.97,8224.816,8227.519,"You know, we've had robust discussion.",540,,
1458,0.97,8227.519,8232.257,We had a robust discussion this morning at Council briefing about the Scooter legislation.,540,,
1459,0.97,8232.257,8241.633,"And first, I just really want to thank Sdot, the Mayor's office, especially Joel Miller for presenting at the last transportation and utilities committee meeting.",540,,
1460,0.97,8241.633,8248.84,"As I've said before, we've been engaged in a long intellectual conversation for 18 months or longer.",540,,
1461,0.97,8248.84,8257.248,"And I still have concerns about safety, parking equity, how this program is used, how it will be rolled out and implemented.",540,,
1462,0.97,8257.248,8269.761,"I feel that Sdot is working in good faith with us, and I feel that any changes that we need to see made to the permanent structure will be made.",540,,
1463,0.97,8269.761,8278.97,"And if we don't think that the Scooter--Scooters are appropriate for Seattle after we give it a try, we can end the program.",540,,
1464,0.97,8278.97,8287.479,I guess my problem is that for so long we've continued to circle around questions that can only be answered if we try it in the real world.,540,,
1465,0.97,8287.479,8298.023,"It is important that we start now, as I said earlier today, because even right now sunset is at 7:30.",540,,
1466,0.97,8298.023,8301.526,We had sunset at 9:30 just two months ago.,540,,
1467,0.97,8301.526,8304.229,"We are heading into the darker, wetter parts of the year.",540,,
1468,0.97,8304.229,8309.934,And it's important for people to learn how to use these devices in good weather.,540,,
1469,0.97,8309.934,8320.645,Another one of the features as part of the pilot program is that the first ride will only allow a user to travel at 8 miles an hour.,540,,
1470,0.97,8320.645,8323.214,That is the speed that some people can run.,540,,
1471,0.97,8323.214,8328.453,"I can't, but some people can run at 8 miles an hour.",540,,
1472,0.97,8328.453,8333.191,"And so, looking at this, you know, one of my concerns was about equity.",540,,
1473,0.97,8333.191,8336.528,One of my concerns was about safety.,540,,
1474,0.97,8336.528,8352.243,"And especially within this 8 mile an hour issue that was brought up, I asked Sdot if we could--if when we saw users using these device that is they needed more learning time, could we make that change in the permit, and they said yes.",540,,
1475,0.97,8352.243,8353.778,And so I believe them.,540,,
1476,0.97,8353.778,8368.593,"And so I do think that if we are going to continue having a discussion about Scooters, we need to have that discussion rooted in real life data, in real life experience.",540,,
1477,0.97,8368.593,8373.598,And that's why we need to move forward at this time.,540,,
1478,0.97,8373.598,8376.234,I did talk about indemnity earlier today.,540,,
1479,0.97,8376.234,8378.97,And there is robust indemnity within the program.,540,,
1480,0.97,8378.97,8385.343,I do want to just cite though that that doesn't mean that the city will be free from any suit ever.,540,,
1481,0.97,8385.343,8390.982,"People sue for all sorts of reasons for cars, for bikes, for all sorts of things.",540,,
1482,0.97,8390.982,8407.799,"I do want to highlight the fact that, you know, if the issue is with the Scooters Operability, you know, if the Scooter Malfunctions, then there is robust indemnity that would ensure that the city's not liable for us.",540,,
1483,0.97,8407.799,8421.012,That's different than user error or if the city's infrastructure is not up to--has a problem that we've seen before with people using cars or bikes that sue the city because the city's infrastructure is not set up.,540,,
1484,0.97,8421.012,8424.149,And that doesn't have anything to do with Scooters.,540,,
1485,0.97,8424.149,8433.224,That has everything to do with how we create the building environment that we want to see here in the city.,540,,
1486,0.97,8433.224,8443.468,We're going continue seeing additional electrified Micro mobility choices.,540,,
1487,0.97,8443.468,8446.771,We have Rad-Powered bikes in my district.,540,,
1488,0.97,8446.771,8469.06,"Rad-Powered bikes has, I believe, a very large back order during the pandemic because people are starting to move around their spaces and cities using this Micro mobility that is charged with electricity because it allows you to move as quickly as you need to without exerting effort that will make you sweaty when you appear at the destination that you're going to.",540,,
1489,0.97,8469.06,8478.469,And so this will call for a need for more bike lanes and more spaces for people to be able to travel safely with Micro mobility.,540,,
1490,0.97,8478.469,8487.312,"And the reason that we need to move forward today, and thank you Councilmember Herbold for raising your concerns this morning.",540,,
1491,0.97,8487.312,8490.815,I appreciate we need to be thinking about this in a robust manner.,540,,
1492,0.97,8490.815,8504.329,"But a delay today would make the launch of this less safe because of the changing--changing weather, changing daylight as we're moving into fall and winter.",540,,
1493,0.97,8504.329,8516.441,"And having had an academic conversation for so long, if we're going to find the answers to these questions, if we just continue having them in an intellectual fashion, we'll continue circling around these questions.",540,,
1494,0.97,8516.441,8521.846,We are at a point where we need to try this in the real world to get the answers we need to these questions.,540,,
1495,0.97,8521.846,8530.755,"And while I have concerns, I believe those concerns will be alleviated by Sdot should we bring them up from the city Council to the Department.",540,,
1496,0.97,8530.755,8532.056,"Thank you, Council President.",540,,
1497,0.97,8532.056,8533.458,"Thank you, chair Pedersen.",540,,
1498,0.97,8533.458,8535.927,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss.",541,,
1499,0.97,8535.927,8541.566,Are there any other comments on item 20 or 22?,541,,
1500,0.97,8541.566,8542.634,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",541,,
1501,0.97,8542.634,8544.569,Thank you so much.,542,,
1502,0.97,8544.569,8548.439,"As mentioned this morning, I did have some concerns.",542,,
1503,0.97,8548.439,8550.475,I still have concerns.,542,,
1504,0.97,8550.475,8563.855,"I would have appreciated an additional week, but I do understand the position of the executive as it relates to the late date of Council's consideration.",542,,
1505,0.97,8563.855,8569.594,It would have been really great if we had received the legislation earlier.,542,,
1506,0.97,8569.594,8583.775,"And I also want to note that the draft requirements, we only received as of the date of the last committee meeting.",542,,
1507,0.97,8583.775,8602.327,"And these are permanent requirements that, as Council President Gonzalez said this morning, we hope to continue to influence those permitting requirements even after the Council acts on these two bills.",542,,
1508,0.97,8602.327,8642.367,"I'm willing to vote in favor of this legislation at this time despite my concerns because I feel that through the work that my office has done checking in with various advocates about the legislation that hearing from advocates from the disabilities community who are the most vulnerable users of our sidewalks, the fact that, for instance, they were in touch with Joel Miller.",542,,
1509,0.97,8642.367,8655.847,"They're interested in seeing how the end trip phone requirement, one of the things I'm interested in as well, could help resolve some of the sidewalk access issues.",542,,
1510,0.97,8655.847,8665.757,"Marcy carpenter, another disability rights advocate also Conversed with my staff about her interactions.",542,,
1511,0.97,8665.757,8675.833,She said it's been an open and collaborative process and they kept insisting on a place at the table.,542,,
1512,0.97,8675.833,8680.571,And they're happy with the requirements Sdot has for the Scooter use.,542,,
1513,0.97,8680.571,8694.819,She's worried about having too many Scooters on the sidewalks and the sort of Squishy nature of wording around who decides whether or not there's a viable alternative to one riding on the sidewalk.,542,,
1514,0.97,8694.819,8710.401,"But Nevertheless, in voting in favor of these two bills, I do want to make note that there is--there are some important things I believe we need to continue to emphasize to Sdot.",542,,
1515,0.97,8710.401,8715.907,I think it's really important that we closely monitor the al Chi trail.,542,,
1516,0.97,8715.907,8717.742,It's already extremely crowded.,542,,
1517,0.97,8717.742,8730.188,We have heard from the West Seattle bike connections about their concerns about using Scooters in parks or on bike trails.,542,,
1518,0.97,8730.188,8749.941,"And really not only feel that we need to closely monitor trails like the Alki trail, but I'm concerned.",542,,
1519,0.97,8749.941,8761.853,I'm interested in learning more about how we can entice vendors to do Geofencing in areas where it is unacceptable to drive a Scooter.,542,,
1520,0.97,8761.853,8784.609,"And then Lastly, I just want to highlight, you know, again, that I appreciate Councilmember, I'm sorry, Council President Gonzalez's mention this morning that we can still influence the permit requirements outside of the legislative process.",542,,
1521,0.97,8784.609,8798.222,And I hope we find that to be true because I think a number of us have some changes that we would like to request that Sdot make those permitting requirements.,542,,
1522,0.97,8798.222,8799.59,So thank you very much.,542,,
1523,0.97,8799.59,8804.128,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for those comments.",543,,
1524,0.97,8804.128,8804.629,Really appreciate it.,543,,
1525,0.97,8804.629,8805.129,Councilmember Pedersen?,543,,
1526,0.97,8805.129,8805.596,Thank you.,544,,
1527,0.97,8805.596,8817.942,And thank you for--thanks to Councilmember Strauss for shepherding this legislation and you make a really good point about needing to try it to see what's actually going to happen.,544,,
1528,0.97,8817.942,8829.62,I do support improved mobility options by encouraging environmentally friendly alternatives to Gas-Powered single occupancy vehicles.,544,,
1529,0.97,8829.62,8835.293,"And Ideally electric Scooters, E-Scooters will provide an alternative.",544,,
1530,0.97,8835.293,8844.969,"The city government is authorizes a new mode of transportation, so this is a big change that warrant as careful tracking of the results.",544,,
1531,0.97,8844.969,8857.748,"I had been looking forward to a standard pilot project that would measure results for Scooters as we were seeing elsewhere in King County, but, in my opinion, this Sdot legislation is not a detailed pilot.",544,,
1532,0.97,8857.748,8871.295,"In my view, the legislation itself does not explicitly or fully address safety, financial liability, infrastructure costs and measures for success.",544,,
1533,0.97,8871.295,8873.531,"Sdot, however, made a compelling case.",544,,
1534,0.97,8873.531,8880.238,"This legislation's time sensitive, so I fulfilled my role to facilitate discussion, ask questions and enable us to vote on it.",544,,
1535,0.97,8880.238,8893.784,"While a majority of my colleagues approved it at Committee, I was personally not willing to vote yes for something I believe lacks these details.",544,,
1536,0.97,8893.784,8902.593,Both Council bill 119867 and 11968 are only two pages in length.,544,,
1537,0.97,8902.593,8904.862,It leaves the details to the executive branch.,544,,
1538,0.97,8904.862,8919.143,I'll be sending a letter to the Sdot director asking Sdot to return by next June and December to report on the first six months and 12 month of the new program.,544,,
1539,0.97,8919.143,8923.047,Those dates will give them time to assess those results.,544,,
1540,0.97,8923.047,8943.634,"Having Sdot report back to the Committee on specific Metrics of success which would normally be standard for a pilot program, it'll enable Sdot to give us consistent, thorough information to us as Councilmembers and to the general public on the pertinent details and results so we can truly evaluate this new program.",544,,
1541,0.97,8943.634,8951.208,"In my conversations with director Zimbabwe, I've been ensured the Durkan administration also wants these results.",544,,
1542,0.97,8951.208,8972.83,"I believe we need to measure the results to truly assess whether the program is safe, equitable and effective in getting people out of their cars and doing this without requiring tax dollars to cover injury lawsuits or to build special infrastructure that would basically subsidize the profits of private companies headquartered outside of Seattle.",544,,
1543,0.97,8972.83,8979.47,I want to thank the founding director of the prevention center for writing to express his concerns about Scooter safety.,544,,
1544,0.97,8979.47,8983.374,He provided studies from around the country about this.,544,,
1545,0.97,8983.374,8991.482,"Just last week, Dallas, Texas, halted their Scooter program due to safety concerns.",544,,
1546,0.97,8991.482,9003.995,"So this letter will encourage Sdot to get back to us within 6 months and 12 months, but I still have serious concerns about introducing this new mode.",544,,
1547,0.97,9003.995,9004.228,Thanks.,544,,
1548,0.97,9004.228,9006.43,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",545,,
1549,0.97,9006.43,9011.702,Councilmember Mosqueda and then Councilmember Lewis.,545,,
1550,0.97,9011.702,9014.038,"Thank you very much, Council President.",546,,
1551,0.97,9014.038,9016.307,I am really excited about this piece of legislation.,546,,
1552,0.97,9016.307,9019.577,"As folks have said, this is a few years in the making.",546,,
1553,0.97,9019.577,9025.783,But first I want to publicly acknowledge the important questions that Councilmember Herbold asked this morning.,546,,
1554,0.97,9025.783,9028.619,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for your questions and your comments.",546,,
1555,0.97,9028.619,9041.632,And I want to publicly say that this morning I defaulted into a defense of the policy versus really hearing what your question was about leaving a week to hear the impact of the lawsuits and the impact here in Seattle.,546,,
1556,0.97,9041.632,9050.04,So I want to say thank you for that and acknowledge that I defaulted into debating the merits of the policy instead of hearing what you were saying.,546,,
1557,0.97,9050.04,9057.248,So thank you for all of your work on the issues to get to the heart of the questions that are being asked of us today.,546,,
1558,0.97,9057.248,9070.694,"And also for the Council president for sending that Email to Sdot so quickly and for director Zimbabwe to answer those questions, I think that was all very informative in our debate today.",546,,
1559,0.97,9070.694,9087.044,"I think that Councilmember Herbold, your points around wanting to see the policy impacts and really the work prior to deployment of Scooters about how folks can continue to maintain safe trails and sidewalks is going to be very important.",546,,
1560,0.97,9087.044,9089.58,So I look forward to working with you on that.,546,,
1561,0.97,9089.58,9093.717,I want to thank you for your highlighting that issue.,546,,
1562,0.97,9093.717,9094.385,And I absolutely support it.,546,,
1563,0.97,9094.385,9110.734,"I also think it's important as we look at that data to see how this can further inform our efforts to fix our broken bike system and make sure that there's more areas that have protected bike lanes, truly protected bike lanes.",546,,
1564,0.97,9110.734,9125.549,"Councilmember Pedersen, as chair of transportation, I appreciate that you also outlined your concerns and the letter that you'll be sending, I would love to work with you to include a few items as you think about ways to ensure implementation moves forward.",546,,
1565,0.97,9125.549,9132.423,"As I mentioned, one of the things I've had that was a concern in the past was how workers have been treated in the industry.",546,,
1566,0.97,9132.423,9142.733,"But there are some really great examples out of Chicago, for example, on how to make sure that workers in this arena have the protections and benefits that places like Seattle have really fought for.",546,,
1567,0.97,9142.733,9149.406,So I look forward to potentially working with you if possible to include a few questions in that letter.,546,,
1568,0.97,9149.406,9154.345,"And then Lastly, I just want to thank Councilmember Strauss.",546,,
1569,0.97,9154.345,9158.682,"You came in dedicated to this issue, I know, have been working on it for quite a while.",546,,
1570,0.97,9158.682,9165.589,"Really excited to see this effort move forward, even in this pilot initial stage.",546,,
1571,0.97,9165.589,9177.601,"Thanks for your work and your previous office as well, working with Councilmember Bagshaw and, of course, Councilmember O'Brien in their previous roles.",546,,
1572,0.97,9177.601,9185.209,I think this has all taken thoughtful approach to making sure we're advancing on this Multimodal transportation option.,546,,
1573,0.97,9185.209,9189.613,And I'm excited about the work you've done here to move this part across the line.,546,,
1574,0.97,9189.613,9193.584,I also want to thank representative Mackery.,546,,
1575,0.97,9193.584,9213.103,"She was the prime sponsor of 1772 and we received a letter from her outlining how she appreciated this piece of legislation, especially as we're dealing with multiple challenges at the same time.",546,,
1576,0.97,9213.103,9220.778,It's really important to bring people to a position and circle around a bill that creates greater stability and Sustainability for our local environment.,546,,
1577,0.97,9220.778,9238.429,"So really excited about the work she did in Olympia and that this piece of legislation follows other cities, neighboring cities like Tacoma, Spokane, Portland and cities across the globe who have advanced efforts to make sure there's more Micro mobility share options.",546,,
1578,0.97,9238.429,9249.64,"And as she said, we're taking a small but important step to implement a program that will help support the city's commitments to mobility, equity and reduce congestion.",546,,
1579,0.97,9249.64,9253.444,And I'm excited about the work that is in front of us yet to do.,546,,
1580,0.97,9253.444,9254.078,Thank you so much.,546,,
1581,0.97,9254.078,9255.579,Looking forward to supporting this.,546,,
1582,0.97,9255.579,9258.749,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda for those remarks.",547,,
1583,0.97,9258.749,9259.183,Councilmember Lewis?,547,,
1584,0.97,9259.183,9266.09,"Thank you so much, Madame President, and thank you, Councilmember Strauss, for bringing this forward.",548,,
1585,0.97,9266.09,9285.109,"As someone who currently does not own a car and has not owned a car actually for almost a decade now, which is sort of interesting to reflect on, since I was an Undergrad, I am happy to support this legislation today.",548,,
1586,0.97,9285.109,9308.365,"You know, the future of a lot more people coming up in the world who do not own cars are Arrangig their lives specifically in a way to be Multimodal and transit oriented is going to depend on having more options and more Micro mobility options like Scooters and like Bikeshares.",548,,
1587,0.97,9308.365,9324.648,And I think it's time that the city of Seattle tried this out and went through process as Councilmember Strauss has said of essentially literally having the rubber meet the road to see how this could work in the city of Seattle.,548,,
1588,0.97,9324.648,9360.851,"I do continue to have concerns about safety, but I want to be clear, I have concerns about safety all the time as someone who bikes regularly and has been using Biking as my main method of commuting and getting around the city during Covid as somebody who SEES all the time as a pedestrian and a biker the impact that myself and similarly situated bikers and pedestrians are put into by a society that Overrelies on single occupancy vehicles for transportation.",548,,
1589,0.97,9360.851,9366.79,"You know, safety is a conversation that goes beyond just our conversation right now on the pilot.",548,,
1590,0.97,9366.79,9383.006,And I think it's important to center that as we continue to work towards vision zero and continue to work toward not just enhancing Micro mobility but also increasing Protecive infrastructure for Micro mobility platforms around the city.,548,,
1591,0.97,9383.006,9407.03,"I'm also encouraged by some of the safety measures that are baked in to the plan that Sdot is going to be pursuing in term of the maximum speed setting, the banning of riding the Scooters on sidewalks, end trip photo requirements to make sure that they're not blocking or obstructing sidewalks.",548,,
1592,0.97,9407.03,9422.713,This is--these are really important functions that give me confidence that the pilot can return with meaningful data to shape and guide how Scooters can work in our transportation environment.,548,,
1593,0.97,9422.713,9437.161,"I continue to be concerned, as I'm concerned with lots of other transportation mode discussions, but it is definitely time that we tried this.",548,,
1594,0.97,9437.161,9446.603,Expanded the options for getting around the city of Seattle that aren't single occupancy vehicles.,548,,
1595,0.97,9446.603,9452.476,And this pilot will hopefully really lead to a great new addition and option for people to get around the city.,548,,
1596,0.97,9452.476,9455.579,So I look forward to voting for this.,548,,
1597,0.97,9455.579,9457.981,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",549,,
1598,0.97,9457.981,9466.29,Are there any other comments on the bill?,549,,
1599,0.97,9466.29,9467.391,Either of the bills?,549,,
1600,0.97,9467.391,9467.991,"Councilmember Strauss, please.",549,,
1601,0.97,9467.991,9474.965,"Great, and I will close it out if that's all right with you, Council President.",550,,
1602,0.97,9474.965,9493.484,I just also want to highlight what Councilmember Herbold had said about ensuring that this program works for folks that have different ages and abilities who might be experiencing disabilities that we ensure that the the program is set up so we're not Kraeing clutter on our sidewalks.,550,,
1603,0.97,9493.484,9502.96,I want to thank Councilmember Pedersen again for his letter to Sdot because the concerns we have need to be monitored and that's what he's requesting.,550,,
1604,0.97,9502.96,9511.735,We need to see what the real world data reports because we'll keep circling around these intellectual questions until we have that data.,550,,
1605,0.97,9511.735,9533.49,"We need to ensure safety, equity and proper use are retained and we provide people a new way to move through our city that ensures that we are Transitioning away from Gas-Powered cars and that we are able to get people the last mile between the transportation systems that we have and their homes or destinations where they're going.",550,,
1606,0.97,9533.49,9534.124,"Thank you, Council President.",550,,
1607,0.97,9534.124,9540.864,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, and thank you everybody for that robust conversation.",551,,
1608,0.97,9540.864,9556.246,"Really appreciate both the committee conversation, the conversation this morning in Council briefing and the conversation we just had now as indicated before and as I voted in Committee, I intend to vote in favor of both of these bills.",551,,
1609,0.97,9556.246,9573.397,I do think it's time for us to advance the pilot program and begin to have conversations about the future of this mobility device in our city at a greater scale.,551,,
1610,0.97,9573.397,9581.438,And that is only possible in my mind by moving from the theoretical and hypothetical to the real world.,551,,
1611,0.97,9581.438,9590.614,And so this is an opportunity for us to do that and to learn more while still having our ongoing concerns addressed.,551,,

1655,0.97,9798.922,9805.695,Just want to really uplift how important this funding is and for what it's actually going to be used for.,576,,
1656,0.97,9805.695,9841.298,"Not only is it going to be used for stabilization work and the monitoring that has to be done regardless of whether or not there's a decision to repair or replace the bridge, but it's also being--the funds are also going to be used for repairs and enhancements to the lower bridge, which we're also reliant on in this time during the closure of the upper level bridge for priority transit use, freight use and emergency vehicle use.",576,,
1657,0.97,9841.298,9889.779,"In addition, this funding is going to be used for the traffic and mobility mitigation projects, including the West Seattle--the Reconnect West Seattle project that Sdot is circulating a draft set of recommendations for all of the communities that are most impacted by the closure of the bridge with a really strong equity focus on focussing on making important transportation investments to mitigate the impacts of having all of these vehicles going through their neighborhoods as part of the Detour routes, specifically in neighborhoods that have suffered from lack of investment over past years.",576,,
1658,0.97,9889.779,9897.02,The funding is also being used for the planning and design of a long-term replacement.,576,,

1669,0.97,9996.72,10005.795,"This is all really important work, not just for folks on the peninsula, but for the region.",576,,
1670,0.97,10005.795,10023.847,This is a major thoroughfare that serves the entire region and is really important for freight and other economic development needs for our entire region.,576,,
