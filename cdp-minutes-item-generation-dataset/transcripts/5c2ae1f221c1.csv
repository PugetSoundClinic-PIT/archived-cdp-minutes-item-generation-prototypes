66,0.97,334.734,338.237,The big one is around identity and how that is determined.,14,,
67,0.97,338.237,343.943,"We explore that topic not only through the primary story of the sisters, but there are other characters as well.",14,,

127,0.97,725.057,729.929,"Good morning, president pro Tem Pedersen.",19,,
128,0.97,729.929,731.831,And colleagues.,19,,
129,0.97,731.831,733.499,I have a fairly brief report today.,19,,
130,0.97,733.499,756.055,"I want to start off at the top by just letting everybody know that on a fairly quick turnaround, today being the ninth, we will be having a special select committee meeting of the homelessness strategies and investments Committee on August 11th.",19,,
131,0.97,756.055,764.663,"I did state that briefing last week, which is this coming--Thursday?",19,,
132,0.97,764.663,766.098,Sorry.,19,,
133,0.97,766.098,774.106,I just need to make sure if that's in the morning or the afternoon just really briefing.,19,,
134,0.97,774.106,775.908,"Wednesday, and in the afternoon.",19,,
135,0.97,775.908,784.183,We are placing Councilmember Mosqueda's formerly scheduled Finance Committee meeting that has been canceled for that time period.,19,,
136,0.97,784.183,794.627,"So, just as a little bit of background, last Monday I announced that I was hopefully going to have updates at briefing this morning on two things.",19,,
137,0.97,794.627,825.925,"So, that special meeting of the select committee, which I can confirm, will be the afternoon of the 11th to discuss provider capacity issues, and how we might work as a Council to develop divider capacity sufficient to meet the scale of the Council's shelter ambitions as we mentioned in the select committee last month, the Council has funded for 2021 alone, 2250 shelter placements.",19,,
138,0.97,825.925,832.665,250 more than other less ambitious plans that are being floated in the community.,19,,
139,0.97,832.665,839.872,"So, I think it's important to make sure that we talk about all the potential bottlenecks associated with standing up that shelter.",19,,
140,0.97,839.872,844.71,One that frequently emerges his provider capacity.,19,,
141,0.97,844.71,851.15,And the ability to sufficiently staff the shelter options once they are stood up.,19,,
142,0.97,851.15,858.09,We will be joined on Wednesday with representatives from several organizations.,19,,
143,0.97,858.09,862.761,We are still working to produce other providers to be part of that table.,19,,
144,0.97,862.761,878.777,"We will potentially have some additional updates either in written form, or from the human services Department on some of the other outstanding questions that arose during last month committee meeting I appreciate the flexibility of the Council.",19,,
145,0.97,878.777,886.986,Clerk's office and the whole Department in indulging another select committee meeting this early in the month.,19,,
146,0.97,886.986,897.029,"Due to the scheduling challenges of us being on recess soon, it was hard to do one, a meeting later in the month to obtain the necessary Quorum.",19,,
147,0.97,897.029,908.34,"I do think that given the intense interest and urgency of the subject matter, a meeting on that quick Timeline is appropriate and wanted.",19,,
148,0.97,908.34,911.443,"So, I look forward to having that meeting.",19,,
149,0.97,911.443,914.513,On Wednesday afternoon.,19,,
150,0.97,914.513,944.376,"The other thing that I promised an update on for briefing today I'm happy to report some preliminary feedback on one of the items from the committee last month, which was the dispute regarding the funding of the American recovery act villages that the Council appropriated, Resourced to, and that the Mayor signed into effect in the spring of this year.",19,,
151,0.97,944.376,954.987,To create three additional tiny House villages beyond the three that the Council funded in the 2021 budget process last November.,19,,
152,0.97,954.987,1002.501,"There was some dispute as to whether those village--villages were considered fully funded for 2021 I have confirmed last week in meeting with officials from the Mayor's office and human services Department, that there is a commitment from the executive side to move forward with at least the Predevelopment and Rfq for those villages, acknowledging that they will likely not be operational in 2021 but, to complete the early Predevelopment phase, which as we have learned this year can be a considerable amount of the process and setting up these assets.",19,,
153,0.97,1002.501,1011.543,"To be clear, mayoral officials committed to releasing Rfq's for those three villages, request for proposals.",19,,
154,0.97,1011.543,1021.553,"To prevent the provider process in terms of who will operate, or be selected to operate those villages.",19,,
155,0.97,1021.553,1029.728,To engage in a site selection process to identify three additional sites above and beyond the three that we've already been discussing as a Council and a city.,19,,
156,0.97,1029.728,1038.637,To commence any State Environmental protection work that may need to be done based on the sites that are selected.,19,,
157,0.97,1038.637,1053.152,"And to commence community engagement processes around those sites to make sure that we are doing our due diligence and building community around the sites for those tiny houses, as we have done as a city.",19,,
158,0.97,1053.152,1059.691,That is plenty of work for the final quarter of this year on those sites.,19,,
159,0.97,1059.691,1080.279,"I do think, as chair of the committee, that that is a reasonable expectation to at least start there and see what we can build together as a Council and executive leadership team on realizing our goals to stand up those three additional villages.",19,,
160,0.97,1080.279,1086.585,I do not have any deadlines or Timelines yet.,19,,
161,0.97,1086.585,1091.89,"For example on the submission of the Rfq's, which would be the first step.",19,,
162,0.97,1091.89,1099.298,Hopefully we will have a little bit more guidance on where that is by Wednesday when we convene the select committee.,19,,
163,0.97,1099.298,1106.438,Otherwise I'm happy to use briefing as the opportunity to discuss those Timelines as they become more filled in.,19,,
164,0.97,1106.438,1113.011,"Finally, I will be at the magnolia farmers market this coming Saturday.",19,,

173,0.97,1142.674,1164.796,"As chair of the select Committee on homeless services, appreciate you scheduling another meeting and I look forward to attending that on Wednesday to continue the pretty surprising and shocking conversation about the various priorities but I'm glad that there has been an update on at least moving forward on the three tiny horse villages.",21,,
174,0.97,1164.796,1178.21,"Not only Council had approved but utilize $2 million of state funding, recognizing that the multiple levels of government are trying to respond that the crisis of Covid has presented and worsened.",21,,
175,0.97,1178.21,1186.018,"I know there was a lot of concern as well from our state partners, our state legislative partners, about those $2 million not being acted upon.",21,,
176,0.97,1186.018,1190.189,Appreciate the follow through on that.,21,,
177,0.97,1190.189,1195.327,I still have some questions about the timing to see if we could still try to get something operational before the end of the year.,21,,
178,0.97,1195.327,1205.203,"I think there's a lot of concerns from some of the some providers that you been working closely with, that I've been hearing with as well, about not having more village shelter beds to have before winter really hits.",21,,
179,0.97,1205.203,1228.427,"To the extent that we can keep pushing to do what Council and the Mayor has signed into law, but Council had Prioritized in terms of additional funding and to make sure that we are standing up those options for tiny House villages, along with the hotel shelters that have been Prioritized I'm going to be interested more in some of that Timeline question.",21,,
180,0.97,1228.427,1230.862,Appreciate the update there.,21,,
181,0.97,1230.862,1242.574,"I did wonder if he had any update as well about the safe lots and the opportunity to partner with the county for example, to broaden the scope and number of people that we could serve there.",21,,
182,0.97,1242.574,1257.723,"I know that when we were looking into safe walk as an alternative or spaces for people to have Rvs, we had heard that there could be various staffing models that could allow for even more Rvs to be located in various locations.",21,,
183,0.97,1257.723,1277.876,"If we partnered with King County, we could have a Multiplier effect of how many people we could serve I sent a letter, as you know, to the Mayor's office with concerns about various places around the city, but specifically this is a request that has come from advocates for those who are living unsheltered.",21,,
184,0.97,1277.876,1283.215,And also from small business owners who continue to say that there must be a safer place for these individuals to be on an interim basis.,21,,
185,0.97,1283.215,1289.588,Councilmember Herbold had also characterized the safe storage of Rvs as alternatives as well.,21,,
186,0.97,1289.588,1294.493,I'm wondering if you have any updates on those two fronts and also look forward to the meeting on Wednesday.,21,,
187,0.97,1294.493,1295.727,Appreciate it.,21,,
188,0.97,1295.727,1300.899,"Mr. President, can I answer those inquiries?",22,,

190,0.97,1301.8,1303.468,You can just call me Alex.,23,,
191,0.97,1303.468,1306.905,"Oh, gosh.",24,,
192,0.97,1306.905,1309.408,That's the first time you've ever told me to call you Alex.,24,,
193,0.97,1309.408,1315.013,"[Laughter] whenever you call me I always go Hey, Alex.",24,,
194,0.97,1315.013,1318.25,And you are like Councilmember Lewis.,24,,

196,0.97,1321.153,1325.457,"So, thank you, president pro Tem Alex.",24,,
197,0.97,1325.457,1338.47,"To respond to Councilmember Mosqueda's questions, I will say, Councilmember, I did not inquire last week about the safe lot question.",24,,
198,0.97,1338.47,1346.445,I will try to run that down for us in advance of the committee meeting on Wednesday.,24,,
199,0.97,1346.445,1348.547,And apologize.,24,,
200,0.97,1348.547,1357.456,The meeting we had was very specifically about tiny House villages and the budget implications going forward.,24,,
201,0.97,1357.456,1399.698,"I guess to answer your questions regarding that first, we came to an agreement that the villages, those three villages are fully funded for 2021, but they are not--we haven't identified carryforward operating appropriations for 2022 yet . But, if the Council made that clear that we were going to do that, that that might help the budget office get through the issues they need to work through in order to Dependably recommend funding those operations fully.",24,,
202,0.97,1399.698,1420.018,"I do just want to candidly say, based on our process for the first three villages, it seems like a pretty reasonable Timeline if we were to spend the rest of 2021 to get through the Rfq, provider selection, site selection, community engagement.",24,,
203,0.97,1420.018,1426.324,"Then, just be ready to go, fully funded for operations for those three villages starting January 1ST.",24,,
204,0.97,1426.324,1429.628,That seems like it could be doable.,24,,
205,0.97,1429.628,1442.24,I would note that we did fully fund those initial three villages to begin operations beginning on January 1ST.,24,,
206,0.97,1442.24,1453.385,Knowing that that probably wasn't going to be,24,,
207,0.97,1530.395,1540.538,It just seems like there's a lot of pent up community creativity that could be represented in response to those Rfq's.,25,,
208,0.97,1540.538,1545.944,I'll try to get an answer on that before the Committee on Wednesday.,25,,
209,0.97,1545.944,1556.254,"That I can either report in writing from the Department, or someone from the Department can deliver in person.",25,,

300,0.97,2175.873,2188.786,One of the amendments established that the city acknowledges the effects of past racism and is purposely setting forced efforts to address the disproportionate effect on Bipoc communities.,31,,
301,0.97,2188.786,2212.443,The second amendment recognizes that the city must live within the legal constraints as it moves forward with these investments what this means is we have been fortunate continue to make sure that we are in alignment with initiative 200 and that we are following the required legal path to make sure that we are getting dollars directly into communities affected by these lingering effects of racism and investments into communities.,31,,
302,0.97,2212.443,2218.416,We also want to make sure that we have the ability to track obvious investments are going.,31,,

607,0.97,4700.295,4704.8,"Council President Gonzalez has no items on today's introduction and referral calendar, and nothing on today's city council agenda.",53,,
608,0.97,4704.8,4710.739,Just a reminder that the August 10th governor send education committee meeting was canceled.,53,,
609,0.97,4710.739,4717.145,I quickly go to my report here.,53,,
610,0.97,4717.145,4720.816,Our city transportation and utilities committee has nine pieces of legislation on today's full city council agenda.,53,,
611,0.97,4720.816,4722.25,I believe they are items nine through 17.,53,,
612,0.97,4722.25,4727.422,"All nine items, I'll just sum them up very quickly here.",53,,
613,0.97,4727.422,4744.706,"All nine items were unanimously approved by our Committee, and rather than go through the Mall this morning, I encourage colleagues, if you still have any questions about these, to just review the city council central staff memos, contact central staff or my office before this afternoon's meeting.",53,,
614,0.97,4744.706,4748.343,There was nothing controversial at that meeting.,53,,
615,0.97,4748.343,4754.95,The most exciting item was the John Lewis bridge item which Councilmember Juarez will speak more to this afternoon I'm sure.,53,,
616,0.97,4754.95,4761.957,"There is an item of importance that was not from my Committee, but I'm a cosponsor on.",53,,
617,0.97,4761.957,4780.275,"Council bill 120151 in the spirit of engaging the homelessness crisis with the urgency it deserves, Councilmember Lewis and I walked onto last week's introduction and referral calendar that Council bill 120151, which is item one on today's city council agenda.",53,,
618,0.97,4780.275,4788.283,This expedited bill would authorize the city to authorize sound transit for use of their site for a tiny home village in the University district.,53,,
619,0.97,4788.283,4802.297,"I'd like to thank central staff, especially Jeff Sims for quickly finalizing this legislation so we did not have to delay it any longer, and thank you Councilmember Lewis for enabling us to go straight through the Council instead of a committee on this.",53,,
620,0.97,4802.297,4806.401,The Council already authorized the funds during our budget approvals last November.,53,,
621,0.97,4806.401,4817.112,"The nonprofit low income housing Institute known as L.E.H.I., there volunteers have completed building these homes.",53,,
622,0.97,4817.112,4826.121,"The last step is approval of this lease so we can get people off the streets into their own space, and on to a positive future.",53,,
623,0.97,4826.121,4833.929,"The site is approximate 18,000 square feet and can fit approximately 35, 36 tiny home structures.",53,,
624,0.97,4833.929,4835.964,The lease will be for approximately 2.5 years.,53,,
625,0.97,4835.964,4844.039,"After hosting the tiny home village, the construction of new, permanent affordable housing will occur on the site in our University district.",53,,
626,0.97,4844.039,4849.945,To further expedite this project I have asked sound transit to sign the lease today contingent upon our adoption.,53,,
627,0.97,4849.945,4851.246,They have agreed to do that.,53,,
628,0.97,4851.246,4854.95,I want to really thank them.,53,,
629,0.97,4854.95,4860.055,This is the first time they are hosting a tiny home village on the property.,53,,
630,0.97,4860.055,4866.862,"Have also asked the Mayor to sign the legislation within the next 24 hours, and her office has agreed to that.",53,,
631,0.97,4866.862,4870.999,"Finally, our financial administrative services director is standing by ready to sign the lease on behalf of our city government.",53,,
632,0.97,4870.999,4874.803,"So, I know the nonprofit L.E.H.I.",53,,
633,0.97,4874.803,4880.775,"Is eager to get started on the site, so let's finally get this done and get more people who are experiencing homelessness inside.",53,,
634,0.97,4880.775,4888.783,"Ideally this lease could be used as a template for future partnerships, not only in Seattle but also throughout the region to accelerate our response to homelessness.",53,,
635,0.97,4888.783,4896.424,"In district 4, this past Tuesday I attended 10 national night out events in my district in northeast Seattle.",53,,
636,0.97,4896.424,4905.533,"While these annual events were canceled last year due to the Covid pandemic, they bounced back strong with hundreds of blocks signing up across Seattle.",53,,
637,0.97,4905.533,4913.108,Many thanks to the neighbors who organized these block parties . Our police Department is very Shortstaffed.,53,,
638,0.97,4913.108,4924.419,"They were not able to visit most of the locations as they normally do, but the block parties I attended showed a lot of support for our police officers and the difficult challenges they have.",53,,
639,0.97,4924.419,4933.028,"Speaking of which, I was up at 3:00 in the morning this past weekend to attend a couple of police roll calls for officers starting a first watch, which is the nine hour shift from 3:00 A.M.",53,,
640,0.97,4933.028,4935.463,To 12:00 noon.,53,,
641,0.97,4935.463,4943.738,Officers were generous with their feedback and I believe it would be in the city's best interest to continue to boost officer wellness to address extremely low morale.,53,,
642,0.97,4943.738,4953.648,Officer wellness was promoted by officer Lexi Harris before she was killed on I-5 recently.,53,,
643,0.97,4953.648,4958.153,"Supporting officer wellness will show we care about the city employees, and want them to stay.",53,,
644,0.97,4958.153,4971.299,"I believe we cannot afford to lose more highly trained officers and detectives have the record-breaking attrition the Department has already experienced, which makes it difficult to cover the entire city as required by our city charter.",53,,
645,0.97,4971.299,4974.502,And has caused response times to increase for priority one calls.,53,,
646,0.97,4974.502,4991.72,"I'm hopeful we will consider, not only in a proposal the Durkin administration sent to city council on July 29th to provide hiring incentive for new offices, but also think of strategies for retaining the highly trained professional city employees we already have.",53,,
647,0.97,4991.72,4994.756,"To the officers listening, I encourage you to stay with Seattle.",53,,
648,0.97,4994.756,4995.29,Thank you.,53,,
649,0.97,4995.29,4997.292,"Councilmember Lewis, please.",53,,
650,0.97,4997.292,5008.436,"Thank you, for just giving me a moment to comment and talk about the tiny House lease.",54,,
651,0.97,5008.436,5035.029,"I'll have more comments this afternoon, but one thing I did want to just flag now because it seems appropriate given your remarks about the possibility of using this lease, which was negotiated over the course of several months with a considerable amount of feedback on both sides, to start this first ever partnership between sound transit and the city to host a tiny House village.",54,,
652,0.97,5035.029,5069.664,"I did just want to note for the public and for the record here, sound transit has provided three additional prospective sites that could accommodate tiny House villages that are not currently being used for one of the three initial sites that are currently under redevelopment, including the one in Roosevelt . The expansion of the Interbay village, and then one up in the North Seattle neighborhood.",54,,
653,0.97,5069.664,5091.586,"So, I do think there is plenty of scope, at least for the precedent that this lease could have to inform one or two, or even three additional villages on the three sound transit sites that have been provided, and that sound transit has indicated they would be more than willing to host a village on.",54,,
654,0.97,5091.586,5095.89,I also just ate this to underscore that there may be some issues with posting additional tiny House villages.,54,,
655,0.97,5095.89,5104.599,Availability of sites is not one my office has accumulated a list of dozens of appropriate sites.,54,,
656,0.97,5104.599,5107.535,That we could pick knowing that we don't have to pick all of them.,54,,
657,0.97,5107.535,5110.605,Even if just a couple are suitable.,54,,
658,0.97,5110.605,5128.389,"So, I did just want to say, to your point Councilmember Pedersen, I do think it could at least be a precedent for moving more swiftly on one, two, or three of those additional sound transit sites, and we should be looking at that as a Council and a city.",54,,
659,0.97,5128.389,5132.861,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",55,,
660,0.97,5132.861,5139.701,"Lastly, transportation and utilities committee meets on the first and third Wednesday of each month at 9:30 in the morning.",55,,
661,0.97,5139.701,5142.337,Our next committee meeting will be August 18th.,55,,
662,0.97,5142.337,5145.34,That concludes my report.,55,,
663,0.97,5145.34,5151.446,"So, Councilmembers, we can now adjourn Council briefing, and we will see you all this afternoon.",55,,
664,0.97,5151.446,5153.348,Thank you so much.,56,,
665,0.97,5153.348,5159.32,Thank you so much.,57,,
